      <field name="fulltext">Volume One An Introduction, Etc. TO MY PARENTS HULINGS AND MARGARET WITT MILLER AN INTRODUCTION WHEN LITTLE SISTER CAME We dwelt in the woods of the Tippecanoe, In a lone, lost cabin, with never a view Of the full day's sun for a whole year through. With strange half hints through the russet corn We three were hurried one night. Next morn There was frost on the trees, and a sprinkle of snow And tracks on the ground. We burst through the door, And a girl baby cried—and then we were four. We were not sturdy, and we were not wise, In the things of the world, and the ways men dare; A pale-browed mother with a prophet's eyes A father that dreamed and looked anywhere. Three brothers—wild blossoms, tall fashioned as men And we mingled with none, but we lived as when The pair first lived, ere they knew the fall; And loving all things we believed in all. AT LORD BYRON'S TOMB. O master, here I bow before a shrine; Before the lordliest dust that ever yet Moved animate in human form divine. Lo! dust indeed to dust. The mould is set Above thee, and the ancient walls are wet, And drip all day in dark and silent gloom; As if the cold gray stones could not forget Thy great estate shrunk to this sombre room, But learn to weep perpetual tears above thy tomb. LATER LINES PREFERRED BY LONDON COLUMBUS Behind him lay the gray Azores, Behind the Gates of Hercules; Before him not the ghost of shores; Before him only shoreless seas. The good mate said: “Now must we pray, For lo! the very stars are gone, Brave Adm'r'l speak; what shall I say?” “Why, say: ‘Sail! on! sail on! and on!’” “My men grow mutinous day by day; My men grow ghastly, wan and weak.” The stout mate thought of home; a spray Of salt wave washed his swarthy cheek. “What shall I say, brave Adm'r'l, say, If we sight naught but seas at dawn?” “Why, you shall say at break of day: ‘Sail on! sail on! sail on! and on!’” They sailed and sailed, as winds might blow, Until at last the blanched mate said: “Why, now not even God would know Should I and all my men fall dead. These very winds forget their way, For God from these dread seas is gone. Now speak, brave Adm'r'l, speak and say—” He said: ‘Sail on! sail on! and on!’” They sailed. They sailed. Then spake the mate: “This mad sea shows his teeth tonight. He curls his lip, he lies in wait, He lifts his teeth, as if to bite! Brave Adm'r'l, say but one good word: What shall we do when hope is gone?” The words leapt like a leaping sword: “Sail on! sail on! sail on! and on!” Then pale and worn, he paced his deck, And peered through darkness. Ah, that night Of all dark nights! And then a speck— A light! A light! At last a light! It grew, a starlit flag unfurled! It grew to be Time's burst of dawn. He gained a world; he gave that world Its grandest lesson: “On! sail on!” The London “Atheneum,” years after the royal reception given my first books, pronounced this the best American poem. Let me say to my following it is far from that; even I have done better; too much like a chorus. “The passing of Tennyson” is better. “The Missouri” better still. Besides, “The Missouri” has a right to exist, as it stirred the waters from “The Shining Mountains” to the Gulf of Mexico, and taught the nation to no longer disdain “The Father of Waters.” But I accept the “Atheneum's” generous praise with gratitude and call the attention of my American doubters to the fact that my European triumphs were not due, as they have insisted, entirely to new scenes, for the Gates of Hercules and the Azores are as old as the hills. Meantime, let it be borne in mind that the Missouri, “the great, dark water,” or “the mad, muddy water,” as some translate it, reaches from the heart of Montana to within hail of the Cuban seas. The Mississippi, clear as crystal from its conflux with the somber and surging Missouri up even to its source—“Veritas Caput” —Itasca Lake, is in every sense quite another river and entirely of another character, in all respects. Give the Missouri his due and we have here in the heart of the Republic, and all our own, the noblest, if not the longest, river on the globe. THE MISSOURI Where ranged thy black-maned, woolly bulls By millions, fat and unafraid; Where gold, unclaimed in cradlefuls, Slept 'mid the grass roots, gorge, and glade; Where peaks companioned with the stars, And propped the blue with shining white, With massive silver beams and bars, With copper bastions, height on height— There wast thou born, O lord of strength! O yellow lion, leap and length Of arm from out an Arctic chine To far, fair Mexic seas are thine! What colors? Copper, silver, gold With sudden sweep and fury blent, Enwound, unwound, inrolled, unrolled, Mad molder of the continent! What whirlpools and what choking cries From out the concave swirl and sweep As when some god cries out and dies Ten fathoms down thy tawny deep! Yet on, right on, no time for death, No time to gasp a second breath! You plow a pathway through the main To Morro's castle, Cuba's plain. Hoar sire of hot, sweet Cuban seas, Gray father of the continent, Fierce fashioner of destinies, Of states thou hast upreared or rent, Thou know'st no limit; seas turn back, Bent, broken from the shaggy shore; But thou, in thy resistless track, Art lord and master evermore. Missouri, surge and sing and sweep! Missouri, master of the deep, From snow-reared Rockies to the sea Sweep on, sweep on eternally! THE PASSING OF TENNYSON My kingly kinsmen, kings of thought, I hear your gathered symphonies, Such nights as when the world is not, And great stars chorus through my trees. We knew it, as God's prophets knew; We knew it, as mute red men know, When Mars leapt searching heaven through With flaming torch, that he must go. Then Browning, he who knew the stars, Stood forth and faced insatiate Mars. Then up from Cambridge rose and turned Sweet Lowell from his Druid trees— Turned where the great star blazed and burned, As if his own soul might appease. Yet on and on through all the stars Still searched and searched insatiate Mars. Then stanch Walt Whitman saw and knew; Forgetful of his “Leaves of Grass,” He heard his “Drum Taps,” and God drew His great soul through the shining pass, Made light, made bright by burnished stars; Made scintillant from flaming Mars. Then soft-voiced Whittier was heard To cease; was heard to sing no more, As you have heard some sweetest bird The more because its song is o'er. Yet brighter up the street of stars Still blazed and burned and beckoned Mars: And then the king came; king of thought, King David with his harp and crown. . . . How wisely well the gods had wrought That these had gone and sat them down To wait and welcome 'mid the stars All silent in the light of Mars. All silent. . . . So, he lies in state. . . . Our redwoods drip and drip with rain. . . . Against our rock-locked Golden Gate We hear the great, sad, sobbing main. But silent all. . . . He passed the stars That year the whole world turned to Mars. THE AMERICAN OCEAN “Ten thousand miles of mobile sea— This sea of all seas blent as one Wide, unbound book of mystery, Of awe, of sibly prophecy, Ere yet a ghost or misty ken Of God's far, first beginning when Vast darkness lay upon the deep:” “He looked to heaven, God; but she Saw only his face and the sea.” “Aye, day is done, the dying sun Sinks wounded unto death tonight; A great, hurt swan, he sinks to rest, His wings all crimson, blood his breast! With wide, low wings, reached left and right, He sings, and night and swan are one— One huge, black swan of Helicon.” THE BIRDS AND BEES I think the bees, our blessed bees, Are better, wiser far than we, The very wild birds in the trees Are wiser far, it seems to me; For love and light and sun and air Are theirs, and not a bit of care. What bird makes claim to all God's trees? What bee makes claim to all God's flowers? Behold their perfect harmonies, Their common hoard, the common hours! Say, why should man be less than these, The happy birds, the hoarding bees? CALIFORNIA'S CUP OF GOLD The golden poppy is God's gold, The gold that lifts, nor weighs us down The gold that knows no miser's hold, The gold that banks not in the town, But singing, laughing, freely spills Its hoard far up the happy hills; Far up, far down, at every turn.— What beggar has not gold to burn! THE FORTUNATE ISLES You sail and you seek for the Fortunate Isles, The old Greek Isles of the yellow bird's song? Then steer straight on through the watery miles, Straight on, straight on, and you can't go wrong. Nay not to the left, nay not to the right, But on, straight on, and the Isles are in sight, The old Greek Isles where yellow birds sing And life lies girt with a golden ring. These Fortunate Isles they are not so far, They lie within reach of the lowliest door; You can see them gleam by the twilight star; You can hear them sing by the moon's white shore— Nay, never look back! Those leveled grave stones They were landing steps; they were steps unto thrones Of glory for souls that have gone before, And have set white feet on the fortunate shore. And what are the names of the Fortunate Isles? Why, Duty and Love and a large Content. Lo! these are the Isles of the watery miles, That God let down from the firmament. Aye! Duty, and Love, and a true man's trust; Your forehead to God though your feet in the dust. Aye! Duty to man, and to God meanwhiles, And these, O friend, are the Fortunate Isles. DON'T STOP AT THE STATION DESPAIR We must trust the Conductor, most surely; Why, millions of millions before Have made this same journey securely And come to that ultimate shore. And we, we will reach it in season; And ah, what a welcome is there! Reflect then, how out of all reason To stop at the Station Despair. Aye, midnights and many a potion Of bitter black water have we As we journey from ocean to ocean— From sea unto ultimate sea— To that deep sea of seas, and all silence Of passion, concern and of care— That vast sea of Eden-set Islands— Don't stop at the Station Despair! Go forward, whatever may follow, Go forward, friend-led, or alone; Ah me, to leap off in some hollow Or fen, in the night and unknown— Leap off like a thief; try to hide you From angels, all waiting you there! Go forward; whatever betide you, Don't stop at the Station Despair! TO RUSSIA “Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?”— Bible. Who tamed your lawless Tartar blood? What David bearded in her den The Russian bear in ages when You strode your black, unbridled stud, A skin-clad savage of your steeps? Why, one who now sits low and weeps, Why, one who now wails out to you— The Jew, the Jew, the homeless Jew. Who girt the thews of your young prime And bound your fierce divided force? Why, who but Moses shaped your course United down the grooves of time? Your mighty millions all today The hated, homeless, Jew obey. Who taught all poetry to you? The Jew, the Jew, your hated Jew. Who taught you tender Bible tales Of honey-lands, of milk and wine? Of happy, peaceful Palestine? Of Jordan's holy harvest vales? Who gave the patient Christ? I say, Who gave your Christian creed? Yea, yea, Who gave your very God to you? Your Jew! Your Jew! Your hated Jew! TO ANDREW CARNEGIE Hail, fat king Ned! Hail, fighting Ted, Grand William, Grim Oom Paul! But I'd rather twist Carnegie's wrist, That open hand in this, Than shake hands with ye all. I dislike personal and occasional lines so entirely that I think you can search these six volumes through in vain for another poem of this character. But there is only this one Carnegie; the best-hearted and the best-headed American citizen that ever wrote a book. Not long ago, when he was about to sail away, the Authors' Club of New York gave him a dinner, my publisher asked me for some lines. I did not know Mr. Carnegie then, personally, but as I admired him and his work as heartily as I despised his petty detractors, I sent the above brief summing up of Kings, with Carnegie at the head. TRUE GREATNESS How sad that all great things are sad,— That greatness knows not to be glad. The boundless, spouseless, fearful sea Pursues the moon incessantly; And Cæsar childless lives and dies. The thunder-torn Sequoia tree In solemn isolation cries Sad chorus with the homeless wind Above the clouds, above his kind, Above the bastioned peak, above All sign or sound or sense of love. How mateless, desolate and drear His lorn, long seven thousand year! My comrades, lovers, dare to be More truly great than Cæsar; he Who hewed three hundred towns apart, Yet never truly touched one heart. The tearful, lorn, complaining sea The very moon looks down upon, Then changes,—as a saber drawn; The great Sequoia lords as lone As God upon that fabled throne. No, no! True greatness, glory, fame, Is his who claims not place nor name, But loves, and lives content, complete, With baby flowers at his feet. ON THE FIRING LINE For glory? For good? For fortune, or for fame? Why, ho, for the front where the battle is on! Leave the rear to the dolt, the lazy, the lame; Go forward as ever the valiant have gone. Whether city or field, whether mountain or mine, Go forward, right on for the firing line! Whether newsboy or plowboy or cowboy or clerk, Fight forward; be ready, be steady, be first; Be fairest, be bravest, be best at your work; Exult and be glad; dare to hunger, to thirst, As David, as Alfred—let dogs skulk and whine— There is room but for men on the firing line. Aye, the one place to fight and the one place to fall— As fall we must all, in God's good time— It is where the manliest man is the wall, Where boys are as men in their pride and prime. Where glory gleams brightest, where brightest eyes shine— Far out on the roaring red firing line. —Success Magazine. TO RACHAEL IN RUSSIA “To bring them unto a good land and a large; unto a land flowing with milk and honey.” O thou, whose patient, peaceful blood Paints Sharon's roses on thy cheek, And down thy breasts played hide and seek, Six thousand years a stainless flood, Rise up and set thy sad face hence. Rise up and come where Freedom waits Within these white, wide ocean gates To give thee God's inheritance; To bind thy wounds in this despair; To braid thy long, strong, loosened hair. O Rachel, weeping where the flood Of icy Volga grinds and flows Against his banks of blood-red snows— White banks made red with Rachel's blood— Lift up thy head, be comforted; For, as thou didst on manna feed, When Russia roamed a bear in deed, And on her own foul essence fed, So shalt thou flourish as a tree When Russ and Cossack shall not be. Then come where yellow harvests swell; Forsake that savage land of snows; Forget the brutal Russian's blows; And come where Kings of Conscience dwell. Oh come, Rebecca to the well! The voice of Rachel shall be sweet! The Gleaner rest safe at the feet Of one who loves her; and the spell Of Peace that blesses Paradise Shall kiss thy large and lonely eyes. —Century Magazine. CUBA LIBRE Comes a cry from Cuban water— From the warm, dusk Antilles— From the lost Atlanta's daughter, Drowned in blood as drowned in seas; Comes a cry of purpled anguish— See her struggles, hear her cries! Shall she live, or shall she languish? Shall she sink, or shall she rise? She shall rise, by all that's holy! She shall live and she shall last; Rise as we, when crushed and lowly, From the blackness of the past. Bid her strike! Lo, it is written Blood for blood and life for life. Bid her smite, as she is smitten; Behold, our stars were born of strife! Once we flashed her lights of freedom, Lights that dazzled her dark eyes Till she could but yearning heed them, Reach her hands and try to rise. Then they stabbed her, choked her, drowned her, Till we scarce could hear a note. Ah! these rusting chains that bound her! Oh! these robbers at her throat! And the kind who forged these fetters? Ask five hundred years for news. Stake and thumbscrew for their betters? Inquisitions! Banished Jews! Chains and slavery! What reminder Of one red man in that land? Why, these very chains that bind her Bound Columbus, foot and hand! She shall rise as rose Columbus, From his chains, from shame and wrong— Rise as Morning, matchless, wondrous— Rise as some rich morning song— Rise a ringing song and story, Valor, Love personified. . . . Stars and stripes, espouse her glory, Love and Liberty allied. Written for and read by the Baroness de Bazus in all our great cities before the Spanish war. LESSONS FOR MY LOVERS IS IT WORTH WHILE? Is it worth while that we jostle a brother Bearing his load on the rough road of life? Is it worth while that we jeer at each other In blackness of heart?—that we war to the knife? God pity us all in our pitiful strife. God pity us all as we jostle each other; God pardon us all for the triumphs we feel When a fellow goes down; poor heart-broken brother, Pierced to the heart; words are keener than steel, And mightier far for woe or for weal. Were it not well in this brief little journey On over the isthmus down into the tide, We give him a fish instead of a serpent, Ere folding the hands to be and abide For ever and aye in dust at his side.? Look at the roses saluting each other; Look at the herds all at peace on the plain— Man, and man only, makes war on his brother, And dotes in his heart on his peril and pain— Shamed by the brutes that go down on the plain. Why should you envy a moment of pleasure Some poor fellow-mortal has wrung from it all? Oh! could you look into his life's broken measure— Look at the dregs—at the wormwood and gall— Look at his heart hung with crape like a pall— Look at the skeletons, hideous, unholy, Look at his cares in their merciless sway, I know you would go and say tenderly, lowly, Brother—my brother, for aye and a day, Lo! Lethe is washing the blackness away. LINES THAT PAPA LIKED PLEASANT TO THE SIGHT “And God planted a garden eastward in Eden wherein He caused to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food.” Behold the tree, the lordly tree, That fronts the four winds of the storm A fearless and defiant form That mocks wild winter merrily! Behold the beauteous, budding tree With censors swinging in the air, With arms in attitude of prayer, With myriad leaves, and every leaf A miracle of color, mold, More gorgeous than a house of gold! Each leaf a poem of God's plan, Each leaf as from His book of old To build, to bastion man's belief: Man's love of God, man's love of man. Aye, love His trees, leaf, trunk, or root, The comely, stately, upright grace That greets God's rain with lifted face; The great, white, beauteous, highborn rain That rides as white sails ride the main, That wraps alike leaf, trunk or shoot, When sudden thunder lights his torch And strides high Heaven's ample porch. Aye, love God's tree, leaf, branch and root. For God set first the pleasant tree; The “good for food” came tardily. The poor, blind hog knows but the fruit, And wallows in his fat and dies, A hog, up to his every eyes. A HARD ROW FOR STUMPS You ask for manliest, martial deeds? Go back to Ohio's natal morn— Go back to Kentucky's fields of corn; Just weeds and stumps and stumps and weeds! Just red men blazing from stump and tree Where buckskin'd prophets 'midst strife and stress Came crying, came dying in the wilderness, That hard, first, cruel half-century! What psalms they sang! what prayers they said, Cabin or camp, as the wheels rolled west; Silently leaving their bravest, best— Paving a Nation's path with their dead! What unnamed battles! what thumps and bumps! What saber slashes with the broad, bright hoe! What weeds in phalanx! what stumps in row! What rank vines fortressed in rows of stumps! Just stumps and nettles and weed-choked corn Tiptoeing to wave but one blade in air! Dank milkweed here, and rank burdock there Besieging and storming that blade forlorn! Such weed-bred fevers, slow sapping the brave— The homesick heart and the aching head! The hoe and the hoe, 'till the man lay dead And the great west wheels rolled over his grave. And the saying grew, as sayings will grow From hard endeavor and bangs and bumps: “He got in a mighty hard row for stumps; But he tried, and died trying to hoe his row.” O braver and brighter this ten-pound hoe, Than brightest, broad saber of Waterloo! Nor ever fell soldier more truly true Than he who died trying to hoe his row. The weeds are gone and the stumps are gone— The huge hop-toad and the copperhead, And a million bent sabers flash triumph instead From stately, clean corn in the diamond-sown dawn. But the heroes have vanished, save here and there, Far out and afield like some storm-riven tree, Leans a last survivor of Thermopylæ, Leafless and desolate, lone and bare. His hands are weary, put by the hoe; His ear is dull and his eyes are dim. Give honor to him and give place for him, For he bled and he led us, how long ago! And ye who inherit the fields he won, Lorn graves where the Wabash slips away, Go fashion green parks where your babes may play Unhindered of stumps or of weeds in the sun. I have hewn some weeds, swung a heavy, broad hoe— Such weeds! such a mighty hard row for stumps! Such up-hill struggles, such down-hill slumps As you, please God, may never once know! But the sea lies yonder, just a league below, All down-hill now, and I go my way— Not far to go, and not much to say, Save that I tried, tried to hoe my row. AT MARY'S FOUNTAIN, NAZARETH What sound was that? A pheasant's whir? What stroke was that? Lean low thine ear. Is that the stroke of the carpenter, That far, faint echo that we hear? Is that the sound that sometime Bedouins tell Of hammer stroke as from His hand it fell? It is the stroke of the carpenter, Through eighteen hundred years and more Still sounding down the hallowed stir Of patient toil; as when He wore The leathern dress,—the echo of a sound That thrills for aye the toiling, sensate ground. Hear Mary weaving! Listen! Hear The thud of loom at weaving time In Nazareth. I weave this dear Tradition with my lowly rhyme. Believing everywhere that she may hear The sound of toil, sweet Mary bends an ear. Yea, this the toil that Jesus knew; Yet we complain if we must bear. Are we more dear? Are we more true? Give us, O God, and do not spare! Give us to bear as Christ and Mary bore With toil by leaf-girt Nazareth of yore! TO SAVE A SOUL “How shall man surely save his soul?” 'Twas sunset by the Jordan. Gates Of light were closing, and the whole Vast heaven hung darkened as the fates. “How shall man surely save his soul?” he said, As fell the kingly day, discrowned and dead. Then Christ said: “Hear this parable: Two men set forth and journeyed fast To reach a place ere darkness fell And closed the gates ere they had passed; Two worthy men, each free alike of sin, But one did seek most sure to enter in. “And so when in their path there lay A cripple with a broken staff, The one did pass straight on his way, While one did stoop and give the half His strength, and all his time did nobly share Till they at sunset saw their city fair. “And he who would make sure ran fast To reach the golden sunset gate, Where captains and proud chariots passed, But, lo, he came one moment late! The gate was closed, and all night long he cried He cried and cried, but never watch replied. “Meanwhile the man who cared to save Another as he would be saved, Came slowly on, gave bread and gave Cool waters, as he stooped and laved The wounds. At last, bent double with his weight, He passed, unchid, the porter's private gate. “Hear then this lesson, hear and learn: He who would save his soul, I say, Must lose his soul; must dare to turn And lift the fallen by the way; Must make his soul worth saving by some deed That grows, and grows some small last seed.” THE VOICE OF THE DOVE Come, listen O Love to the voice of the dove, Come, hearken and hear him say “There are many Tomorrows, my Love, my Love, There is only one Today.” And all day long you can hear him say This day in purple is rolled And the baby stars of the milky way They are cradled in cradles of gold. Now what is thy secret serene gray dove Of singing so sweetly alway? “There are many Tomorrows, my Love, my Love, There is only one Today.” WASHINGTON BY THE DELAWARE The snow was red with patriot blood, The proud foe tracked the blood-red snow. The flying patriots crossed the flood A tattered, shattered band of woe. Forlorn each barefoot hero stood, With bare head bended low. “Let us cross back! Death waits us here: Recross or die!” the chieftan said. A famished soldier dropped a tear— A tear that froze as it was shed: For oh, his starving babes were dear— They had but this for bread! A captain spake: “It cannot be! These bleeding men, why, what could they? 'Twould be as snowflakes in a sea!” The worn chief did not heed or say. He set his firm lips silently, Then turned aside to pray. And as he kneeled and prayed to God, God's finger spun the stars in space; He spread his banner blue and broad, He dashed the dead sun's stripes in place, Till war walked heaven fire shod And lit the chieftain's face: Till every soldier's heart was stirred, Till every sword shook in its sheath— “Up! up! Face back. But not one word!” God's flag above; the ice beneath— They crossed so still, they only heard The icebergs grind their teeth! Ho! Hessians, hirelings at meat While praying patriots hunger so! Then, bang! Boom! Bang! Death and defeat! And blood? Ay, blood upon the snow! Yet not the blood of patriot feet, But heart's blood of the foe! O ye who hunger and despair! O ye who perish for the sun, Look up and dare, for God is there; And man can do what man has done! Think, think of darkling Delaware! Think, think of Washington! FOR THOSE WHO FAIL From “Memorie and Rime,” by permission of Funk &amp; Wagnalls, publishers of the Standard Dictionary and the Standard Library, of which this above book is one. “All honor to him who shall win the prize,” The world has cried for a thousand years; But to him who tries, and who fails and dies, I give great honor and glory and tears: Give glory and honor and pitiful tears To all who fail in their deeds sublime; Their ghosts are many in the van of years, They were born with Time, in advance of their Time. Oh, great is the hero who wins a name, But greater many and many a time Some pale-faced fellow who dies in shame, And lets God finish the thought sublime. And great is the man with a sword undrawn, And good is the man who refrains from wine; But the man who fails and yet still fights on, Lo, he is the twin-born brother of mine. THE LIGHT OF CHRIST'S FACE Behold how glorious! Behold The light of Christ's face; and such light! The Moslem, Buddhist, as of old, Gropes helpless on in hopeless night. But lo, where Christ comes, crowned with flame, Ten thousand triumphs in Christ's name. Elijah's chariot of fire Chained lightnings harnessed to his car! Jove's thunders bridled by a wire— Call unto nations “here we are!” Lo! all the world one sea of light, Save where the Paynim walks in night. CALIFORNIA'S RESURRECTION The rain! The rain! The generous rain! All things are his who knows to wait. Behold the rainbow bends again Above the storied, gloried Gate— God's written covenant to men In Tyrian tints on cloth of gold, Such as no tongue or pen hath told! Behold brown grasses where you pass— A sleeping lion's tawny mane, Brown-breasted Mother Earth in pain Of travail—God's forgiving grass Long three days dead to rise again To lead us upward, on and on— Each blade a shining sabre drawn. Behold His Covenant is true! Lo! California soon shall wear About her ample breast each hue That yonder hangs high-arched mid air! Behold the very grasses knew! Behold the Resurrection is! Behold what witness like to this? IN MEN WHOM MEN CONDEMN In men whom men condemn as ill I find so much of goodness still, In men whom men pronounce divine I find so much of sin and blot, I hesitate to draw a line Between the two, where God has not. DEATH IS DELIGHTFUL Death is delightful. Death is dawn, The waking from a weary night Of fevers unto truth and light. Fame is not much, love is not much, Yet what else is there worth the touch Of lifted hands with dagger drawn? So surely life is little worth: Therefore I say, look up; therefore I say, one little star has more Bright gold than all the earth of earth. THE SONG OF THE SILENCE O, heavens, the eloquent song of the silence! Asleep lay the sun in the vines, on the sod, And asleep in the sun lay the green-girdled islands, As rock'd to their rest in the cradle of God. God's poet is silence! His song is unspoken, And yet so profound, so loud, and so far, It fills you, it thrills you with measures unbroken, And as soft, and as fair, and as far as a star. The shallow seas moan. From the first they have mutter'd And mourn'd, as a child, and have wept at their will . . . The poems of God are too grand to be utter'd: The dreadful deep seas they are loudest when still. THE TREES The trees they lean'd in their love unto trees, That lock'd in their loves, and were so made strong, Stronger than armies; ay, stronger than seas That rush from their caves in a storm of song. THE LAST SUPPER “And when they had sung an hymn they went out unto the Mount of Olives.”— Bible. What song sang the twelve with the Saviour When finish'd the sacrament wine? Where they bow'd and subdued in behavior, Or bold as made bold with a sign? What sang they? What sweet song of Zion With Christ in their midst like a crown? While here sat Saint Peter, the lion; And there like a lamb, with head down, Sat Saint John, with his silken and raven Rich hair on his shoulders, and eyes Lifting up to the faces unshaven Like a sensitive child's in surprise. Was the song as strong fishermen swinging Their nets full of hope to the sea? Or low, like the ripple-wave, singing Sea-songs on their loved Galilee? Were they sad with foreshadow of sorrows, Like the birds that sing low when the breeze Is tip-toe with a tale of tomorrows,— Of earthquakes and sinking of seas? Ah! soft was their song as the waves are That fall in low musical moans; And sad I should say as the winds are That blow by the white gravestones. MOTHER EGYPT Dark-browed, she broods with weary lids Beside her Sphynx and Pyramids, With low and never-lifted head. If she be dead, respect the dead; If she be weeping, let her weep; If she be sleeping, let her sleep; For lo, this woman named the stars! She suckled at her tawny dugs Your Moses while you reeked in wars And prowled your woods, nude, painted thugs. Then back, brave England; back in peace To Christian isles of fat increase! Go back! Else bid your high priests mold Their meek bronze Christs to cannon bold; Take down their cross from proud St. Paul's And coin it into cannon-balls! You tent not far from Nazareth; Your camps trench where his child-feet strayed. If Christ had seen this work of death! If Christ had seen these ships invade! I think the patient Christ had said, “Go back, brave men! Take up your dead; Draw down your great ships to the seas; Repass the Gates of Hercules. Go back to wife with babe at breast, And leave lorn Egypt to her rest.” Or is Christ dead, as Egypt is? Ah, England, hear me yet again; There's something grimly wrong in this— So like some gray, sad woman slain. What would you have your mother do? Hath she not done enough for you? Go back! And when you learn to read, Come read this obelisk. Her deed Like yonder awful forehead is Disdainful silence. Like to this What lessons have you writ in stone To passing nations that shall stand? Why, years as hers will leave you lone And level as yon yellow sand. Saint George? Your lions? Whence are they From awful, silent Africa. This Egypt is the lion's lair; Beware, brave Albion, beware! I feel the very Nile should rise To drive you from this sacrifice. And if the seven plagues should come? The red seas swallow sword and steed? Lo! Christian lands stand mute and dumb To see thy more than Moslem deed. LINES MOTHER LIKED OH, FOR ENGLAND'S OLD-TIME THUNDER! Oh, for England's old sea thunder! Oh, for England's bold sea men, When we banged her over, under And she banged us back again! Better old-time strife and stresses, Cloud topt towers, walls, distrust; Better wars than lazinesses, Better loot than wine and lust! Give us seas? Why, we have oceans! Give us manhood, sea men, men! Give us deeds, loves, hates, emotions! Else give back these seas again. THE BRAVEST BATTLE The bravest battle that ever was fought; Shall I tell you where and when? On the maps of the world you will find it not; It was fought by by the mothers of men. Nay, not with cannon or battle shot, With sword or braver pen; Nay, not with eloquent word or thought, From mouths of wonderful men. But deep in a woman's walled-up heart— Of woman that would not yield, But patiently, silently bore her part— Lo! there in that battle-field. No marshaling troop, no bivouac song; No banners to gleam and wave; And oh! these battles they last so long— From babyhood to the grave! Yet, faithful still as a bridge of stars, She fights in her walled-up town— Fights on and on in the endless wars, Then silent, unseen—goes down. A few years ago, when living in my log cabin, Washington, some ladies came to inform me that I had been chosen to write a poem for the unveiling of an equestrian statue of a hero, the hero of “The bravest battles that ever were fought.” When they had delivered their message I told them that the beautiful city was being disfigured by these pitiful monuments to strife, not one in forty being fit works of art, and that I hoped and believed that the last one of these would be condemned to the scrap heap within the next century. I reminded them that while nearly every city in the Union had more or less of these monstrosities I had seen but one little figure in honor of woman; that of a crude bit of granite to the memory of a humble baker woman in a back street of New Orleans, who gave away bread to the poor. I finally told them, however, that if they would come back next morning I would have a few lines about “The bravest battles that ever were fought.” One of them came, got the few lines, but they were not read at the unveiling. However, they were read later in New York, by a New Orleans lady, of noble French extraction, the Baroness de Bazus, and they have since been read many times, in many lands, and, I am told, in many languages. THE DEAD CZAR A storm burst forth! From out the storm The clean, red lightning leapt, And lo! a prostrate royal form . . . And Alexander slept! Down through the snow, all smoking, warm, Like any blood, his crept. Yea, one lay dead, for millions dead! One red spot in the snow, For one long damning line of red, Where exiles endless go— The babe at breast, the mother's head Bowed down, and dying so. And did a woman do this deed? Then build her scaffold high, That all may on her forehead read Her martyr's right to die! Ring Cossack round on royal steed! Now lift her to the sky! But see! From out the black hood shines A light few look upon! Lorn exiles, see, from dark, deep mines, A star at burst of dawn! . . . A thud! A creak of hangman's lines!— A frail shape jerked and drawn! . . . The Czar is dead; the woman dead, About her neck a cord. In God's house rests his royal head— Hers in a place abhorred— Yet I had rather have her bed Than thine, most royal lord! Aye, rather be that woman dead, Than thee, dead-living Czar, To hide in dread, with both hands red, Behind great bolt and bar . . . You may control to the North Pole, But God still guides His star. MOTHERS OF MEN “Oh, give me good mothers! Yea, great, glad mothers, Proud mothers of dozens, indeed, twice ten; Fair mothers of daughters and mothers of men, With old-time clusters of sisters and brothers, When grand Greeks lived like to gods, and when Brave mothers of men, strong breasted and broad, Did exult in fulfilling the purpose of God.” THE LITTLE BROWN MAN Where now the brownie fisher-lad? His hundred thousand fishing-boats Rock idly in the reedy moats; His baby wife no more is glad. But yesterday, with all Nippon, Beneath his pink-white cherry-trees, In chorus with his brown, sweet bees, He careless sang, and sang right on. Take care! for he has ceased to sing; His startled bees have taken wing! His cherry-blossoms drop like blood; His bees begin to storm and sting; His seas flash lightning, and a flood Of crimson stains their wide, white ring; His battle-ships belch hell, and all Nippon is but one Spartan wall! Aye, he, the boy of yesterday, Now holds the bearded Russ at bay; While, blossom'd steeps above, the clouds Wait idly, still, as waiting shrouds. But oh, beware his scorn of death, His love of Emperor, of isles That boast a thousand bastioned miles Above the clouds where never breath Of frost or foe has ventured yet, Or foot of foreign man has set! Beware his scorn of food (his fare Is scarcely more than sweet sea-air); Beware his cunning, sprite-like skill— But most beware his dauntless will. Goliath, David, once again, The giant and the shepherd youth— The tallest, smallest of all men, The trained in tongue, the trained in truth. Beware this boy, this new mad man! That erst mad man of Macedon, Who drank and died at Babylon; That shepherd lad; the Corsican— They sat the thrones of earth! Beware This new mad man whose drink is air! His bees are not more slow to strife, But, stirred, they court a common death! He knows the decencies of life— Of all men underneath the sun He is the one clean man, the one Who never knew a drunken breath! Beware this sober, wee brown man, Who yesterday stood but a span Beneath his blossomed cherry-trees, Soft singing with his brother bees! The brownie's sword is as a snake, A sudden, sinuous copperhead: It makes no flourish, no mistake; It darts but once—the man is dead! 'Tis short and black; 'tis never seen Save when, close forth, it leaps its sheath And, snake-like, darts up from beneath. But oh, its double edge is keen! It strikes but once, then on, right on: The sword is gone—the Russ is gone! —From the Century. The Japanese, or more properly the Nipponese, are the only entirely temperate people I ever knew, and travel has been my trade since a lad. True, there are English, American, French, German hotels at Nagasaki, Kobe, Tokio, and like large cities, where the tourist can have “all the comforts of a home” and disport himself much as at Newport or Saratoga. And here the little brown man often brings his venerable parent and others of his house to dine, observe foreigners, and listen to the music; but they all eat sparingly and drink not at all, in the sense that the white man drinks. His wildest dissipation is cold tea. CHILKOOT PASS And you, too, banged at the Chilkoot, That rock-locked gate to the golden door! These thunder-built steeps have words built to suit, And whether you prayed or whether you swore 'Twere one where it seemed that an oath was a prayer— Seemed God couldn't care, Seemed God wasn't there! And you, too, climbed to the Klondike And talked, as a friend, to those five-horned stars! With muckluck shoon and with talspike You, too, bared head to the bars, The heaven-built bars where morning is born, And drank with maiden morn From Klondike's golden horn! And you, too, read by the North Lights Such sermons as never men say! You sat and sat with the midnights That sit and that sit all day: You heard the silence, you heard the room, Heard the glory of God in the gloom When the icebergs boom and boom! Then come to my Sunland, my soldier, Aye, come to my heart and to stay; For better crusader or bolder Bared never a breast to the fray. And whether you prayed or whether you cursed You dared the best and you dared the worst That ever brave man durst. THE FOURTH IN HAWAIIAN WATERS Sail, sail yon skies of cobalt blue, O star-built banner of the brave! We follow you, exult in you Or Arctic peak or sapphire wave; From mornlit Maine to dusk Luzon, Or set of sun or burst of dawn. From Honolulu's Sabbath seas, From battle-torn Manila's bay We toss you bravely to the breeze This nation's natal day to stay— To stay, to lead, lead on and on Or set of sun or burst of dawn. O ye who fell at Bunker Hill, O ye who fought at Brandywine, Behold your stars triumphant still; Behold where Freedom builds her shrine, Where Freedom still leads on and on, Or set of sun or burst of dawn.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Volume Two Songs of the Sierras WALKER IN NICARAGUA CHANT I I That man who lives for self alone Lives for the meanest mortal known. I celebrate no man of strife, I eat no bread with blood upon. 'Twere braver far to live unknown, To live alone and die alone Than owe sweet song, aye owe sweet life, Or sweeter fame, to saber drawn. II Wreathe ye who may the victor's bay, Fill book on book with battles, then Fill every public park you may With iron-fashioned fighting men Begirt with blade and cannon ball, With not one woman's plinth mid all. But she who rocks the cradle, she Who croons and rocks all day, all night, And knows no public place or name Makes far the better, braver fight, Deserves a nobler, fairer fame Than all bronze men of historie. The foot that rocks the babe to rest Keeps step, keeps song with singing dawn. The hand that holds the babe to breast Is sceptered as King Solomon. And yet, for all she does, has done, Has not one monument, not one! III And he who guides the good plowshare, Binds golden sheaves, unnamed, unknown, Who harvests what his hand hath sown, Does more for God, for man, his own— Dares more than all mad heroes dare. IV And like to him the man who keeps Calm watch on Freedom's outer wall, Who sees the great moon rise and fall Yet sleeps and rests and rests and sleeps— The man who knows, the man who sees God in the grass, God in the trees, Sees good in all, sees God in all— Gets more, gives more, does more true weal Than all your storied men of steel. V But nobler still the man who leads Far out the deadly firing line To hew the way, subdue, refine By dauntless and unselfish deeds; Who lays aside his student's book And gathers up his knotted thews And, facing westward, hews and hews The way for plowshare, pruning hook And scarce recks if he win or lose; Who sees white duty over all, Fair duty, halo-topt and tall, Far pointing where his pathway lies, And dares not falter, rest, repine, But forward, forward, wins and—dies. VI I sing this man who sought man's good, Who fought for peace, unselfish fought, Who silent fell and murmured not, This man whom no man understood, This great man so well-nigh forgot, This man who led, who faltered not, This student, soldier, president, Who chose the weaker side and sent Such spirit through his fearless few As only Khartoum Gordon knew. VII I sing those children of the sun Because I love them and because I would that you should love them, too, As tenderly as he had done Ere Fate laid her cold finger to His bounding pulse and bade him pause. VIII A man to love, a land to love; A land of gold, of sapphire seas, Such blue below, such blue above, Such fruits and ever-flowered trees— The fairest Eden-land that is, And I am joyed that it is his; He won it, holds, with dust-full hands— This soldier born, born and not made, Who scorned to make rude war a trade. IX A soldier born, let this be said Above my brave, dishonored dead; I ask no more, this is not much, Yet I disdain a colder touch To memory as dear as his; For he was true as steel, or star, And brave as Yuba's grizzlies are, Yet gentle as a panther is Mouthing her young in her first fierce kiss. X A dash of sadness in his air, Born, may be, of his over care, And may be, born of a despair In early love—I never knew; I question not, as many do, Of things as sacred as this is; I only know that he to me Was all a father, friend, could be; I sought to know no more than this Of history of him or his. A piercing eye, a princely air, A presence like a chevalier, Half angel and half Lucifer; Sombrero black, with plume of snow That swept his careless locks below; A red serape with bars of gold, All heedless falling, fold on fold, A sash of silk, where flashing swung A sword as swift as serpent's tongue, In sheath of silver chased in gold; Great Spanish spurs with bells of steel That dash'd and dangled at the heel; A face of blended pride and pain, Of mingled pleading and disdain, With shades of glory and of grief— The famous filibuster chief Stood front his men among the trees That top the fierce Cordilleras, With bent arm arched above his brow;— Stood still, he stands, a picture, now— Long gazing down his inland seas. XI What strange, strong, bearded men were these He led above his tropic seas! Men sometimes of uncommon birth, Men rich in stories all untold, Who boasted not, though more than bold, Blown from the four parts of the earth. Men mighty-thewed, as Sampson was, That had been kings in any cause, A remnant of the races past; Dark-browed, as if in iron cast, Broad-breasted as twin gates of brass,— Men strangely brave and fiercely true, Who dared the West when giants were, Who erred, yet bravely dared to err— A remnant of that dauntless few Who held no crime or curse or vice As dark as that of cowardice; With blendings of the worst and best Of faults and virtues that have blest Or cursed or thrilled the human breast. XII They rode, a troop of bearded men, Rode two and two out from the town, And some were blonde and some were brown, And all as brave as Sioux; but when From warlike Leon south, the line That bound them in the laws of man Was passed, and peace stood mute behind And streamed a banner to the wind The world knew not, there was a sign Of awe, of silence, rear and van. XIII Men thought who scarce had thought before; I heard the clang and clash of steel From sword at hand and spur at heel And iron feet, but nothing more. XIV Some thought of Texas, some of Maine, But one of wood-set Tennessee. And one of Avon thought, and one Thought of an isle beneath the sun, And one, a dusky son of Spain, Soft hummed his señorita's air Half laughed, shook back his heavy hair And then—he would not think again, And one of Wabash thought, and he Thought tenderly, thought tearfully; And one turned sadly to the Spree. XV Defeat meant something more than death; The world was ready, keen to smite, As stern and still beneath its ban With iron will and bated breath, Their hands against their fellow-man, They rode—each man an Ishmaelite. XVI But when we topped the hills of pine, These men dismounted, doffed their cares, Talk'd loud and laugh'd old love affairs, And on the grass took meat and wine, And never gave a thought again To land or life that lay behind, Or love, or care of any kind Beyond the present cross or pain. XVII And I, a waif of stormy seas, A child among such men as these, Was blown along this savage surf And rested with them on the turf, And took delight below the trees. XVIII I did not question, did not care To know the right or wrong. I saw That savage freedom had a spell, And loved it more than word can tell. I snapped my fingers at the law, And dared to laugh, and laughed to dare. XIX I bear my burden of the shame,— I shun it not, and naught forget, However much I may regret; I claim some candor to my name, And courage cannot change or die,— Did they deserve to die? they died! Let justice then be satisfied, And as for me, why, what am I? XX The standing side by side till death, The dying for some wounded friend, The faith that failed not to the end, The strong endurance till the breath And body took their ways apart, I only know. I keep my trust. Their vices! earth has them by heart: Their virtues! they are with the dust. XXI How we descended, troop on troop, As wide-winged eagles downward swoop! How wound we through the fragrant wood, With all its broad boughs hung in green, With sweeping mosses trailed between! How waked the spotted beasts of prey, Deep sleeping from the face of day, And dashed them, like a dashing flood, Down deep defile and densest wood! XXII What snakes! long, lithe and beautiful As green and graceful boughed bamboo. How they did twine them through and through Green boughs that hung red-fruited full! One, monster-sized, above me hung, Close eyed me with his bright pink eyes, Then raised his folds, and swayed and swung, And licked like lightning, his red tongue, Then oped his wide mouth with surprise; He writhed and curved and raised and lowered His folds, like liftings of the tide, Then sank so low I touched his side, As I rode by, with my boy's sword. The trees shook hands high overhead, And bowed and intertwined across The narrow way, while leaves and moss And luscious fruit, gold-hued and red, Through all the canopy of green, Let not one sun-shaft shoot between. XXIII Birds hung and swung, green-robed and red, Or drooped in curved lines dreamily, Rainbows reversed, from tree to tree, Or sang low hanging overhead— Sang low, as if they sang and slept, Sang faint like some far waterfall, And took no note of us at all, Though nuts that in the way were spread Did crash and crackle where we stept. XXIV Wild lilies, tall as maidens are, As sweet of breath, as purely fair, As fair as faith, as true as truth, Fell thick before our iron tread, In fragrant sacrifice of ruth. Rich ripened fruit a fragrance shed And hung in hand-reach overhead, In nest of blossoms on the shoot, The very shoot that bore the fruit. XXV How ran lithe monkeys through the leaves! How rush'd they through, brown clad and blue, Like shuttles hurried through and through The threads a hasty weaver weaves! How quick they cast us fruits of gold, Then loosened hand and all foothold, And hung, limp, limber, as if dead, Hung low and listless overhead; And all the time with half oped eyes Bent full on us in mute surprise— Looked wisely too, as wise hens do That watch you with the head askew. XXVI The long day through, from blossomed trees, There came the sweet song of sweet bees, With chorus tones of cockatoo That slid his beak along the bough And walked and talked and hung and swung, In crown of gold and coat of blue, The wisest fool that ever sung, Or wore a crown or held a tongue. XXVII Oh! when we broke the somber wood And pierced at last a sunny plain, How wild and still with wonder stood The proud mustangs with bannered mane And necks that never knew a rein, And nostrils lifted high, and blown, Fierce breathing as a hurricane: Yet by their leader held the while In solid column, square and file. And ranks more martial than our own! XXVIII Some one above the common kind, Some one to look to, lean upon, May be, is much a woman's mind; But it was mine, and I had drawn A rein beside the chief while we Rode down the mesa leisurely. Then he grew kind and questioned me Of kindred, home, and home affair, Of how I came to wander there, And had my father herds and land And men in hundreds at command? At which I, silent, shook my head, Then, timid, met his eyes and said: “Not so. Where sunny foothills run Down to the North Pacific sea, And where Willamette meets the sun In many angles, patiently My father tends some flocks of snow, And turns alone the mellow sod And sows some fields not over broad, And mourns my long delay in vain, Nor bids one serve man come or go; While mother from her wheel or churn, And maybe from the milking shed, Oft lifts an humbled wearied head To watch and wish her boy's return Across the camas' blossomed plain.” XXIX He held his bent head very low, A sudden sadness in his air; Then reached and touched my yellow hair And tossed the long locks in his hand, Toyed with them, sudden let them go, Then thrummed about his saddle bow As thought ran swift across his face; Then turning instant in his place, He gave some short and quick command. They brought the best steed of the band, They swung a carbine at my side, He bade me mount and by him ride, And from that hour to the end I never felt the need of friend. XXX Far in a wildest quinine wood We found a city old—so old Its very walls were turned to mould And stately trees upon them stood. No history has mentioned it, No map has given it a place; The last dim trace of tribe and race— The world's forgetfulness is fit. XXXI It held one structure grand and moss'd, Mighty as any castle sung, And old when oldest Ind was young, With threshold Christian never crossed; A temple builded to the sun, Along whose somber altar-stone Brown, bleeding virgins had been strown Like leaves, when leaves are crisp and dun, In ages ere the Sphynx was born, Or Babylon knew night, or morn. XXXII My chief swift up the marble stept— He ever led, through that wild land— When down the stones, with double hand To his machete, a Sun priest leapt, Hot bent to barter life for life, A Texan drave his Bowie knife Full through his thick and broad breast bone, And broke the point against the stone, The dark stone of the temple wall. I saw him loose all hold and fall Full length with head hung down the stone; I saw run down a ruddy flood Of smoking, pulsing human blood. Then from the dusk there crept a crone And kissed the gory hands and face, And smote herself. Then one by one Some dusk priests crept and did the same, Then bore the dead man from the place. Down darkened aisles the brown priests came, So picture-like, with sandaled feet And long, gray, dismal, grass-wove gowns, So like the pictures of old time, And stood all still and dark of frowns, At blood upon the stone and street. Stern men laid ready hand to sword And boldly spake some bitter word; But they were stubborn still and stood Fierce frowning as a winter wood, And mutt'ring something of the crime Of blood upon their temple stone, As if the first that it had known! XXXIII We strode on through each massive door With clash of steel at heel, and with Some swords all red and ready drawn. I traced the sharp edge of my sword Along both marble wall and floor For crack or crevice; there was none. From one vast mount of marble stone The mighty temple had been cored By nut-brown children of the sun, When stars were newly bright and blithe Of song along the rim of dawn, A mighty marble monolith! CHANT II I So old, so new and yet how old This forest's green, that mesa's gold! Rank, wild oats, waving in wild strength— The lion's tawny mane and length! Rank Artemesia, odorous And gray with bald antiquity— The rough arroyo swallowed us As we rode down by two, by three, The braying ass, the neighing stud— And now the mesa, broad and free; Tall cacti blooms, as tipt with blood: And here a burning bush, and there The red night-blooming cereus Kneeled low, as if saluting us— Kneeled as some red-robed monk at prayer, High up the gleaming steeps of snow Of Zacatecas, Mexico. To left such green wood, and such green! To right brown mesa, bald and bare: But where we rode, the two between— Such crimson, crimson everywhere! Aye, earth was gaily garmented; The great, green robe spread far away, So far no man would dare to say, And this great, green robe fringed with red, Lay trackless, lifeless as the dead. The yellow lion's skin behind, The wild oats waving in the wind; But that dense, silent wold of death Drew not a breath, knew not a breath! II From Oro Yarè toward the sea Slow rounding down the river's source, Red men, brown men, foot, cavalry, We marched, a mottled, maniac force— We rode so close to this dense wood, So somber, silent, deep and lorn, That when at last we slow drew rein The heat was as a choking pain. The chief stood in his stirrups; stood With set lips lifted up in scorn To thus be baffled by a wood And looked and looked that sultry morn: The while our allies looked away As if in dread to say or stay. Far, far afield from out the night Of silent blackness burst a cone Of comely fashion, marble white, And lone as God, as white and lone As God upon the great white throne. He beck'd some brown men, bade them say: Then slow, a sandaled, nude old man, As if not daring to say nay Began, fast pointing far away— Then two, then three, then all began. III Such stories as our allies said Of such strange people meshed and hid That drear, deep wilderness amid— Their very name they spoke with dread! They were not white men, brown men, red, Not Spanish blood, not native blood, Not Toltec, Aztec, but a race Of cruel men who claimed to trace Their fathers back beyond the flood— Beyond the time when they alone Took refuge on their rock-ribb'd cone. Such stories as our allies told Of gold, of river-beds of gold Far in that lost land's wood-walled heart That lay below the comely cone As made our filibusters start And think of this and this alone: The while the silent chief looked down Upon their zeal with sullen frown. Such stories of red gold at morn When savage rivers, sudden born Of thunder, had swept on and on— Such seams of gold that lay upon White beds of quartz, bright as the sun When night and sudden storm were done: Free gold for all who deemed it fit To stoop, take up and husband it. Such stories as our allies told Or armlets, wristlets, wrought in gold So massive that the arms grew long And sinewy and over strong For battle from the very weight Of gold; of gold-wrought arrowheads, Of gold in shallow brooklet beds As plentiful as yellow corn Sown ere the blackbirds swoop at morn To storm the thrifty farmer's gate: IV Such stories as our allies told Of how, in armored days of old, The Spaniard here had dared and died In all his splendid strength and pride, In maddened greed for this red gold: How, many times in after years, Troop after troop went forth again, The Spanish Don, the dauntless son, To dare the dread obsidian spears, The gold-wrought arrowheads like rain— But never one returned, not one! Such stories as our allies said Of tall, dusk women, garmented Like unto fairest flowered trees; Of busy women, like to bees, Who chased the purple butterfly Far up the gray steeps of the sky And plucked his little silken nest To spin and weave the gorgeous vest, The yellow robe, raboso red: Such stories as our allies told Of temples builded to the sun, Of human sacrifice and how, Like stealthy panthers, even now, These beauteous, sultry, moonlit nights, Hard men steal down, just as of old, And seize fair maidens for their rites: That this was why the land lay bare Of flock or field or maiden fair, All up and down, for leagues away— That even now, this very day, Their yonder homeward trail was plain With little footprints made in pain: Torn feet that turn not back again. V You ask me what my chieftain said? He rarely said, he simply did. Dismounting where the lame feet led, Shut in as shuts a coffin lid, He chose his choicest at a sign And silent led right on and on; Right on all day, right on all night, And not one foot set left or right, And not one faltered yea or nay Or turned his head to see or say Until, at sudden burst of dawn, A smell of water was and then That ugly, growling, bulldog drum! It turned the very leaves one side The while it howled, “They come! They come!” VI And they, too, came, came as a blast Of twisting March winds, gust on gust, Whirl red leaves, dead leaves, ashes, dust— A cyclone scarce could sweep so fast. Scant time to choose a friendly tree, Scarce time to drop a bended knee, To catch quick carbine to its place And fall hard fighting, face to face. Was ever such hot place of death! Scarce room was there to draw full breath: Red vines climbed up, green boughs hung down, Red-pepsin, green-leaved rubber-tree, Black banyan in black density! I dared a precious second's pause To choose my tree: I chose because Great ivy vines climbed high, climbed higher All crimson to its very crown— Elijah's chariot of fire! VII Such tangle, jungle, who could stand? Such jungle, tangle, who could see? What need, indeed, to see when we Fell instant fighting, hand to hand? Long bamboo lances searched us out, Short javelins, with points of glass, Great arrowheads of gold, like hail! Ah! it had been a sorry rout Had each not held his narrow pass— With not one left to tell the tale. They fought in herd, they fell in heap, Rushed here, rushed there, like silly sheep, And met behind each blazing tree A double-barreled battery, A dozen deadly, leaden shot, Till suddenly the rush and din Of arrow, spear, lance, javelin, And all that frenzied host was not. VIII And yet, what scores could not retreat! 'Twas pitiful! Spare me the pain, The hard, sad detail of the slain, The brave dead clutching to the loam As if to hold their ancient home Forever back from stranger feet! IX He dashed right on, but bade me stay; No time for parley or delay; He called his every man to come— As ever, he was still the first— His men were dying, dead of thirst: And then to drive the vantage home! X A little time, then such a shout! I knew the men then drank their fill, I felt their feasting, do not doubt, I smelled ripe plantains, rind of red And cored like unto yellow cream; I saw bananas bank the stream, Ripe mangoes hanging overhead— So dead with hunger, thirst! I seem To see them, breathe them, taste them still: To see men feasting to their fill, One hand the gun, red fruit in one, The swift, sweet water at their feet: And I shall see, shall feel them eat And drink and drink till life is done. I heard a cautious low-bird call. He came, and with him came just one: Canteen, machete, ripe mangoes, gun, And I must eat, drink, share with all. XI Just then a child, her sweet face red With blood, crept from a heap of dead. I leaned down, drew her to my knee, Bathed her sweet face, then hurriedly To where a dying comrade lay Beside his war-torn battle tree; And lo! the poor girl followed me And tried to help, to soothe, to say. The chief had chased the frenzied throng On o'er the stream a short half mile; Had watched it melt into the isle And then, as if ten thousand strong Stood at his back in bold guard line, Had placed his every man, save one— Then up and down, machete and gun, They paced and passed the countersign, And laughed their city, Chantalè, Laughed gold-strewn, gory Chantalè Dim seen through copse of banyan tree. And light of step, as jaunty, gay As on some happy holiday They stepped with head high in the air, And sang, sang loud and saucily. And now and then a shot rang out At interval of song and shout Tow'rd gold-strewn, gory Chantalè And tore through island vine and tree. XII Gods! what a dauntless, daring sight! Why, these strange men had fought all day! Why, these strong men had marched all night; Why, they had scarcely ate or slept, Yet still with saucy pride they stept And still each step was spank and gay. XIII Dusk came, such solemn, stately dusk! Black clouds blocked up a sky of red, The hot wood had a smell of musk— Of dying roses for the dead. Then lightning was, and thunder low, Low rumbling lion-like and slow, Then that dread drum began to beat A bow-shot front us mid the isle! Why, they had made a mad retreat— Were they not marshaling meanwhile? XIV That bull-dog drum was like a chill; It made night monstrous; men stood still And looked their brave chief in the face. Why, had God filled the fiery skies With thunder, lightning, had He filled The earth with every fighting race That knows the ugly trade of death And asked their lives in sacrifice These men had scarcely cared a breath, Yet now they stood unnerved and chilled. Would it but miss a single note, Pause but to take a single breath, As any bull-dog's breath is drawn, 'Twere not so worse to bear than death! But no, that belching, bull-dog throat Belched on, belched on, right on and on. XV He saw their dread then slowly said “How many? and when will they come?” “Pass me the guard line, chief,” I said, “Pass me the guard and you shall know What says, what means that chilling drum: Night gathers, and the ghostly dead Are not more noiseless where they go Than I shall go, go, come again; Or, silent, join the happier slain.” XVI He wrote, wrote calmly; they must feel His confidence, his nerve of steel, His sure possession to the last. I thrust the thin script down my boot, Stept back, stood firm, made slow salute, Turned on my heel and hastened past. XVII The dappled sky now darkened till The moon came out, and then was gone, And all was black and wild and wide. I should have lost my way and died Had not that drum beat on and on. The warm wave swept above my waist; I pushed right on in eager haste. I felt a light touch suddenly, Looked down in dread and lo! 'twas she. And how could she have passed the line? And why? I thought her surely crazed; Or, may be, sadly hurt and dazed, And took her little hand in mine. I led her up the shallow sand Against the somber, wooded land To where the mango, tamarind And black, wide-rooted banyan tree Reached out to ward and welcome me. I was so worn, so weak and worn My dripping hands hung down as lead. I could not lift my sinking head; I heard the widowed mothers mourn, Still heard that hoarse dog bark and beat And knew they would not now retreat. XVIII And yet I could not lift a hand, But drooped and sank upon the sand. I tried, I tried, I could not rise, I could not open my dull eyes. And all the time that dog kept on, A dog that never would be gone! It made me sleep, it made me dream— That drum seemed some deep orchestra Where I could see sweet players play, Low-voiced; then sudden all did seem A coarse and cruel tragedy. Red lightning lit the ample stage; Black thunder thrust italics through The bloody text, then in his rage, As if not knowing what to do, Turned back and hewed with such mad stroke My mighty trees that I awoke. How I had slept! just clay and clod. For all the living, all the dead, The might, the majesty of God, The hideous, haunting death, the dread— I could but hear that monodin, That monster alligator skin Right on, right on, dog-like and deep, And sleep right on, and sleep and sleep! I thrust, thrust hard out either hand: All still, all chill! I was alone! And she had sold me, my command! At sun the sacrificial stone; And then no more that horrid drum— Why had she gone? where had she gone? I tried to hope she yet might come— The while that drum beat on and on! A finger to her lip, then sand She plucked and let it sift and run And pointed sunward, ere the sun! So many? and they come so soon? The sky was spotted, rain and moon, But with the first cloud we were gone; The while that bull-dog barked right on! He, waiting, leaned and caught her hand, She stooped, took up, let fall the sand Then pointed sunward, ere the sun— A sign, and that brave, worn, guard line, Swift, single file, still as the dead, They passed with mournful, martial tread, Paced back that midnight track again, A piteous line of blood and pain: Yet not one man there to repine, Not one impatient word, not one. XIX He paused, the last man to retreat, When all had silent passed the dead, He stood with bowed, uncovered head, Devoutest hero of defeat. And then he turned, hat still in hand, And bowed before her, low, so low He almost touched her sandaled feet, And gently beckoned she should go: She stirred not and he spake command. I had not known she was so tall, Knew not that she was nobly born Until I saw her black eyes burn And instant take command of all In that long, sudden, sad return, So silent, drooping and forlorn. She beckoned him and he obeyed, Kneeled only as brave men can kneel, Up rose; and then the clank of steel, The eager clutching of a blade— And then the sullen tread and tread: That baying dog behind—the dead! XX She stripped the gold hoops from each hand From wrists, from arms and nothing said, But laid them gently by the dead: Then beckoned quiet, quick command. “Pass on, on, on, at any cost, Not one brief moment to be lost!” Then on, on, on, fast and more fast, And she, alone, the very last, Until, just at the break of day— Were ever bugle notes so clear? Was ever dinner-horn so dear? We heard, we heard our horses neigh! CHANT III I More marches through brown mesa, wood, More marches through too much blood, And then at last sweet inland seas. A city there, white-walled, and brown With age, in nest of orange trees; And this we won and many a town And rancho reaching up and down, Then rested long, sweet, sultry days Beneath the blossom'd orange trees, Made drowsy with the hum of bees, And drank in peace the south-sea breeze, Made sweet with sweeping bough of bays. II Aye, she was shy, so shy at first, And then, ere long, not over shy, Yet pure of soul and proudly chare. No love on earth has such an eye! No land there is, is bless'd or curs'd With such a limb or grace of face, Or gracious form or genial air! In all the bleak North-land not one Hath been so warm of soul to me As coldest soul by that warm sea, Beneath the bright, hot centered sun. III No lands where northern ices are Approach, or even dare compare With warm loves born beneath the sun— The one so near, the one so far! The one the cold, white, steady star, The yellow, shifting sun the one. IV I grant you fond, I grant you fair, I grant you honor, trust and truth, And years as beautiful as youth, And many years beneath the sun, And faith as fixed as any star; But all the North-land hath not one So warm of soul as sun-maids are. V I was but in my boyhood then— Nor knew the coarse, hard ways of men. I count my fingers over, so, And find it years and years ago; But I was tall and lithe and fair, With rippled tide of yellow hair, And prone to mellowness of heart, While she was tawny-red like wine, With black hair boundless as the night. As for the rest, I learned my part, At least was apt, and willing quite To learn, to listen, and incline To teacher warm and wise as mine. VI O bright, bronzed maidens of the Sun! So fairer far to look upon Than curtains of King Solomon, Or Kedar's tents, or any one, Or any thing beneath the Sun! What followed then? What has been done, And said, and writ, and read, and sung? What will be writ and read again, While love is life and life remain, While maids will heed and men have tongue? VII What followed then? But let that pass. I hold one picture in my heart, Hung curtain'd, and not any part Of all its blood tint ever has Been looked upon by any one Beneath the broad, all-seeing sun. VIII Love well who will, love wise who can, But love, be loved, for God is love; Love pure, as cherubim above; Love maid, and hate not any man. Sit as sat we by orange tree, Beneath the broad bough and grape-vine Top-tangled in the tropic shine, Close face to face, close to the sea, And full of the red-centered sun, With sweet sea-songs upon the soul, Rolled melody on melody, As echoes of deep organ's roll, And love, nor question any one. IX If God is love, is love not God? As high priests say, let prophets sing, Without reproach or reckoning; This much I say, knees knit to sod, And low voice lifted, questioning. X Let hearts be pure, let love be true, Let lips be luscious, love be red, Let earth in gold be garmented And tented in her tent of blue; Let goodly rivers glide between Their leaning willow walls of green, Let all things be filled of the sun, And full of warm winds of the sea, And I beneath my vine and tree Take rest, nor war with any one; Then I will thank God with full cause, Say this is well, is as it was. XI Let lips be red, for God has said Love is as one gold-garmented, And made them so for such a time, Therefore let lips be red, therefore Let love be ripe in ruddy prime, Let hope beat high, let hearts be true, And you be wise thereat, and you Drink deep and ask not any more. XII Let red lips lift, proud curl'd to kiss, And round limbs lean and lift and reach In love too passionate for speech, Too full of blessedness and bliss For anything but this and this; Let pure lips lean warm, kind to kiss; Swoon in sweet love, while all the air Is redolent with balm of trees, And mellow with the song of bees, While birds sit singing everywhere— And you will have not any more Than I in boyhood, by that shore Of olives, had in years of yore. XIII Let men unclean think things unclean; I swear tip-toed, with lifted hand, That we were pure as sea-wash'd sand, That not one coarse thought came between; Believe or disbelieve who will, Unto the pure all things are pure, As for the rest, love can endure Alike your good will or your ill. XIV Aye, she was rich in blood and gold— More rich in love, grown over-bold From its own consciousness of strength. How warm! Oh, not for any cause Could I declare how warm she was, In her brown beauty and hair's length. XV We loved in the sufficient sun, We lived in elements of fire, For love is fire, not fierce desire; Yet lived as pure as priest and nun. XVI We lay slow rocking by the bay In slim canoe beneath the crags Thick-topp'd with palms, like sweeping flags Between us and the burning day. The alligator's head lay low Or lifted from his rich rank fern, And watch'd us and the tide by turn, As we slow cradled to and fro. XVII And slow we cradled on till night, And told the old tale, overtold, As misers in recounting gold Each time to take a new delight. XVIII With her pure passion-given grace She drew her warm self close to me; And her two brown hands on my knee, And her two black eyes in my face, She then grew sad and guessed at ill, And in the future seemed to see With woman's ken and prophecy, Yet proffer'd her devotion still. XIX And plaintive so she gave a sign, A token cut of virgin gold, That all her tribe should ever hold Its wearer as some one divine, Nor touch him with unkindly hand. And I in turn gave her a blade, A dagger, worn as well by maid As man, in that hot-temper'd land. XX It had a massive silver hilt, It had a keen and cunning blade, A gift of chief and comrades made For blood at Rivas reckless spilt. XXI “Show this,” said I, “too well 'tis known, And worth a hundred lifted spears, Should ill beset your sunny years; There is not one in Walker's band, But at the sight of this alone, Will reach a brave and ready hand And make your right, or wrong, his own.” XXII Love while 'tis day; night cometh soon, Wherein no man or maiden may; Love in the strong young prime of day; Drink drunk with love in ripe red noon, Red noon of love and life and sun; Walk in love's light as in sunshine, Drink in that sun as drinking wine, Drink swift, nor question any one; For fortunes change, like man, or moon, And wane like warm full day of June. XXIII Oh Love, so fair of promises, Bend here thy bow, blow here thy kiss, Bend here thy bow above the storm But once, if only this once more! Comes there no patient Christ to save, Touch and reanimate thy form Long three days dead and in the grave? Yea, spread ye now thy silken net; Since fortunes change, turn and forget, Since man must fall for some sharp sin, Be thou the pit that I fall in; I seek no safer fall than this. XXIV You lift your face to ask of her, This wine-hued woman, warm sun-maid, This wine-hued woman warm as wine, So purely and so surely mine, Who loved, who dared, was not afraid— Or Princess? Priestess? Prisoner? I never knew or sought to know; I cared not what she might have been; I only knew she was such queen As only death could overthrow. XXV Aye, lover, would you love with zest, Win, hold, and hold her fast and well? Believe, believe the best the best Though she have singed her skirts in hell! Hold not one doubt, house just this thought— That she is all in all you sought. I loved, loved purely, loved profound, I raised love's temple, round by round. I built my temple heavens high, Then shut the door, and she and I Forgot all things, all things save one, Beneath the hot path of the sun. XXVI I would I could forget, and yet I would not to my death forget. I reared my temple to the sky, That glad full moon, and laughed that I Could toy with lightning, till I found, Like some poor fool who toys with fire, And counts him stronger than desire, My temple burning to the ground. XXVII Aye, I had knelt, as priest might kneel Before his saint's shrine, all that day; Had dared to count me strong as steel To stand for aye, clean, tall and white. Yet I broke in that very night, And stole shewbread and wine away. XXVIII I would forget that scene, that place, I would forget that pleading face, Yet hide it deepest in my heart, As coffin in the heart of earth— Alas! a heart so little worth— Locked iron doors and somber lid! Yea, I would have my shrine so hid, So sacred and so set apart, That only I might enter in, Each sleepless, penitential night, And, kneeling, burn my lorn love light To burn away my bitter sin. XXIX Love lifts on white wings to the gates Of Paradise and enters in: Lust has for wings two leaden weights That sink into the lake of sin. Lust squats, toad-like, his loathsome cell, Love seeks the light, on, on, above; Love is as God, as God is love, But lust is Lucifer in hell. XXX Ills come not singly, birds of prey Flock not more closely on than they; Ill comes disguised in many forms; Fair winds are but a prophecy Of foulest winds full soon to be— The brighter these, the blacker they; The brightest night has darkest day And brightest days bring blackest storms. XXXI A land-lost sea with sable bredes, Save where some bastions still are seen, A river stealing through the reeds, Dark, silent, sinuous, serpentine, In sullen haste toward the sun— Such lonesome land, such lonesome sea, Such wine-hued women at the oar, In silent pairs along the shore! But not one man in sight, not one To draw machete or bear a gun. XXXII A shaft of flame, a lifted torch, Leaps sudden from this midland sea, As if to light the very porch Of God's high house eternally. It drops its ashen embers slow And slantwise, like belated snow, On granite columns, gods of stone Hewn ere the gods of Baal were known. XXXIII Some sweet brown hills, like Galilee, Group here or there this dark, still sea, Some costly woods, mahogany, Red cedar, like to Lebanon, Broad olives, like Gethsemane; But silence sits all things upon, As in some dark, hushed house of death. You look behind, you would turn back, You question if you yet take breath. The blackness of this silent sea Is oiled and burnished ebony— The very silence turns to black. XXXIV The silence is as when your dead Lies waiting, candles foot and head, When mourners turn them slowly back With all their sad, sweet prayers said. The sea is black, the shore is black Below Granada's storied steep, Save where red trumpet blossoms blow And trumpet, trumpet night and day, For brave brown soldiers far away In battle for this dreamful deep Where silent women come and go. XXXV Such wine-hued women! such soft eyes! What need one single word be said? A fool might talk and talk all day, Talk, talk and talk until he dies, And yet, for all his hard, loud lies, Will never make one inch advance, Will never say, year and a day, So much as she in one warm glance. XXXVI I see sad mothers here and there Sit by and braid their heavy hair, The while they watch their babes at play. I note no fear, I hear no sigh, Not even hear a baby cry; But Oh! Madonna, mother, bride, Dark mourning with your ebon tide, My heart is with you here today, As yours is with him far away. XXXVII Yet is this sea not always so: I've seen him laughing in the sun, Seen soft brown wavelets leap and flow, Seen opal dimples come and go, Seen argent billows rise and run, Seen fleets of gay boats lifting, borne Along his leaping, laughing tide In all their semi-savage pride. But list! the sea, the shore, is black For those who passed and came not back— He mourns because his daughters mourn. XXXVIII Yon solitary cone of flame That lifts mid-sea to light the skies? I nothing know, scarce know the name, Of yon lost, buried town that lies Beneath its ashes, yet I know The story is, a pretty town, With people passing up and down, Lies just beyond, and deep, so deep That never plummet breaks its sleep. XXXIX And, too, the tale is we are dead And cast forth unto burning hell, While they, down there, live, laugh instead; That with them, down there, all is well, The while they dance all night, all day— While we are dead and cast in hell. XL Aye, idle talk, and yet the town Is there, and perfect, to this day. Row out, far out, and peer you down, A half mile down, some sultry noon, And see shapes passing up and down, As dancers dancing to a tune On some fair, happy day in May. XLI Aye, idle talk, and maybe these, The dancers, be but kelp adrift With undertow of under-seas— Strange under-seas that fall or lift And voiceless ever ebb and flow Beneath the burning crater's plain Through unknown channels to the main; I only note the things I know And loved and lived long years ago. XLII Then came reverses to our arms; I saw the signal light's alarms All night red-crescenting the bay. The foe poured down a flood next day As strong as tides when tides are high, And drove us to the open sea, In such wild haste of flight that we Had hardly time to arm and fly. XLIII Far tossed upon the broadest sea, I lifted my two hands on high, With wild soul plashing to the sky, And cried, “O more than crowns to me, Farewell at last to love and thee!” I walked the deck, I kissed my hand Back to the far and fading shore, And bent a knee as to implore, Until the last dark head of land Slid down behind the dimpled sea. At last I sank in troubled sleep, A very child, rocked by the deep, Sad questioning the fate of her Before the cruel conqueror. XLIV The loss of comrades, power, place, A city walled, cool, shaded ways, Cost me no care at all, somehow, I only saw her sad, sweet face, And—I was younger then than now. XLV Red flashed the sun across the deck, Slow flapped the idle sail, and slow The black ship cradled to and fro. Afar my city lay, a speck Of white against a line of blue; Hard by, half-lounging on the deck, Some comrades chatted, two by two. I held a new-filled glass of wine, And with the Mate talked as in play Of fierce events of yesterday, To coax his light life into mine. XLVI He jerked the wheel, as slow he said, Low laughing with averted head, And so half sad: “You bet, they'll fight; They followed in canim, canoe, A perfect fleet, that on the blue Lay dancing till the mid of night. Would you believe! one little cuss—” (He turned his hard head slow sidewise And 'neath his hat-rim took the skies)— “In petticoats did follow us The livelong night, and at the dawn Her boat lay rocking in the lee, Scarce one short pistol-shot from me.” This said the mate, half mournfully, Then pecked at us; for he had drawn, By bright light heart and homely wit, A knot of men around the wheel, Which he stood whirling like a reel, For the still ship reck'd not of it. XLVII “And where's she now?” one careless said, With eyes slow lifting to the brine, Swift swept the instant far by mine, The bronze mate listed, shook his head, Spirted a stream of ambier wide Across and over the ship side, Jerked at the wheel and slow replied: “She had a dagger in her hand, She rose, she raised it, tried to stand, But fell, and so upset herself; Yet still the poor brown, pretty elf, Each time the long, light wave would toss And lift her form from out the sea, Would shake a sharp, bright blade at me, With rich hilt chased a cunning cross. At last she sank, but still the same She shook her dagger in the air, As if to still defy or dare, And sinking seemed to call your name.” XLVIII I let the wine glass crashing fall, I rushed across the deck, and all The sea I swept and swept again, With lifted hand, with eye and glass, But all was idle and in vain. I saw a red-billed sea bird pass, A petrel sweeping 'round and 'round, I heard the far, white sea-surf sound, But no sign could I hear or see Of one so more than all to me. XLIX I cursed the ship, the shore, the sea, The brave brown mate, the bearded men; I had a fever then, and then Ship, shore and sea were one to me: And weeks we on the dead waves lay, And I more truly dead than they. L At last some rested on an isle; The few strong-breasted, with a smile, Returning to the hostile shore, Scarce counting of the pain or cost, Scarce recking if they won or lost; They sought but action, asked no more; They counted life but as a game, With full per cent against them, and Staked all upon a single hand, And lost or won, content the same. LI I never saw my chief again, I never sought again the shore, Or saw the wood-walled city more. I could not bear the more than pain At sight of blossom'd orange trees, Or blended song of birds and bees, The sweeping shadows of the palm Or spicy breath of bay and balm. LII And, striving to forget the while, I wandered through a dreary isle, Here black with juniper, and there Made white with goats in shaggy coats, The only things that anywhere We found with life in all the land, Save birds that ran, long-bill'd and brown, Long-legg'd and still as shadows are, Like dancing shadows, up and down The sea-rim on the swelt'ring sand. LIII The warm sea laid his dimpled face, With all his white locks smoothed in place, As if asleep against the land; Great turtles slept upon his breast, As thick as eggs in any nest; I could have touched them with my hand. LIV I would some things were dead and hid, Well dead and buried deep as hell, With recollection dead as well, And resurrection God-forbid. They irk me with their weary spell Of fascination, eye to eye, And hot, mesmeric, serpent-hiss, Through all the dull, eternal days. Let them turn by, go on their ways, Let them depart or let me die; For life is but a beggar's lie, And as for death, I grin at it; I do not care one whiff or whit Whether it be or that or this. LV I give my hand; the world is wide; Then farewell, memories of yore! Between us let strife be no more; Turn as you choose to either side; Say Fare-you-well, shake hands and say— Speak fair, and say with stately grace, Hand clutching hand, face bent to face— Farewell, forever and a day! LVI O passion-toss'd and piteous past, Part now, part well, part wide apart, As ever ships on ocean slid Down, down the sea, hull, sail and mast; And in the album of your heart Let hide the pictures of your face, With other pictures in their place, Slid over, like a coffin's lid. LVII The days and grass grow long together; They now fell short and crisp again, And all the fair face of the main Grew dark and wrinkled as the weather. Through all the summer sun's decline Fell news of triumphs and defeats, Of hard advances, hot retreats— Then days and days and not a line. LVIII At last one night they came. I knew, Ere yet the boat had touched the land, That all was lost; they were so few I near could count them on one hand; But he, the leader, led no more. The proud chief still disdained to fly, But like one wrecked, clung to the shore, And struggled on, and struggling fell From power to a prison cell, And only left that cell to die. LIX My recollection, like a ghost, Goes from this sea to that sea-side, Goes and returns, as turns the tide, Then turns again unto the coast. I know not which I mourn the most, My chief or my unwedded wife. The one was as the lordly sun, To joy in, bask in and admire; The twilight star was as the one To love, to look to and desire, And both a part of my young life. LX Years after, sheltered from the sun Beneath a Sacramento bay, A black Muchacho by me lay Along the long grass crisp and dun, His brown mule browsing by his side, And told with all a Peon's pride How he once fought; how long and well, Brave breast to breast, red hand to hand, Against a foe for his fair land, And how the fierce invader fell; And, artless, told me how he died; How walked he from the prison-wall, Serene, prince-like, as for parade, And made no note of man or maid, But gazed out calmly over all— How looked he far, half paused, and then Above the mottled sea of men Slow kissed his thin hand to the sun; Then smiled so proudly none had known But he was stepping to a throne. LXI A nude brown beggar Peon child, Encouraged as the captive smiled, Looked up, half scared, half pitying; He stopped, he caught it from the sand, Put bright coins in its two brown hands, Then strode on like another king. LXII Two deep, a musket's length they stood Afront, in sandals, grim, and dun As death and darkness wove in one, Their thick lips thirsting for his blood. He took each black hand, one by one, And, bowing with a patient grace, Forgave them all and took his place. LXIII He bared his broad brow pleasantly, Gave one long, last look to the sky, The white-winged clouds that hurried by, The olive hills in orange hue; A last list to the cockatoo That hung by beak from mango-bough Hard by and hung and cried as though He never was to call again, Hung all red-crowned and robed in green, With belts of gold and blue between.— A bow, a touch of heart, a pall Of purple smoke, a crash, a thud, A warrior's raiment rolled in blood, A face in dust and—that was all. Success had made him more than king; Defeat made him the vilest thing In name, contempt or hate can bring; So much the leaden dice of war Do make or mar of character. LXIV Speak ill who will of him, he died In all disgrace, say of the dead His heart was black, his hands were red— Say this much and be satisfied; Gloat over it all undenied. I simply say he was my friend When strong of hand and fair of fame: Dead and disgraced, I stand the same To him, and so shall to the end. LXV I lay this crude wreath on his dust, Inwove with sad, sweet memories Recall'd here by these colder seas. I leave the wild bird with his trust, To sing and say him nothing wrong; I wake no rivalry of song. LXVI He lies low in the level'd sand, Unshelter'd from the tropic sun, And now, of all he knew, not one Will speak him fair in that far land. Perhaps 'twas this that made me seek, Disguised, his grave one winter-tide, A weakness for the weaker side, A siding with the helpless weak. LXVII His warm Hondurian seas are warm, Warm to the heart, warm all the time; Huge sea-beasts wallow in their slime And slide, claw foot and serpent form, Slow down the bank, and bellow deep And pitiful, as if it were A very pain to even stir, So close akin to death they keep. LXVIII The low sea bank is worn and torn, All things seem old, so very old; All things are gray with moss and mould, The very seas seem old and worn. Life scarce bides here in any form, The very winds wake not nor say, But sleep all night and sleep all day Nor even dream of stress or storm. LXIX The Carib sea comes in so slow! It stays and stays, as loth to go, A sense of death is in the air, A sense of listless, dull despair, As if Truxillo, land and tide, And all things, died when Walker died. LXX A palm not far held out a hand, Hard by a long green bamboo swung, And bent like some great bow unstrung, And quiver'd like a willow wand; Perched on its fruits that crooked hang, Beneath a broad banana's leaf, A bird in rainbow splendor sang A low, sad song of temper'd grief. LXXI No sod, no sign, no cross nor stone But at his side a cactus green Upheld its lances long and keen; It stood in sacred sands alone, Flat-palmed and fierce with lifted spears; One bloom of crimson crowned its head, A drop of blood, so bright, so red, Yet redolent as roses' tears. LXXII In my left hand I held a shell, All rosy-lipp'd and pearly red; I laid it by his lowly bed, For he did love so passing well The grand songs of his solemn sea. O shell! sing well, wild, with a will, When storms blow loud and birds be still, The wildest sea-song known to thee! LXXIII I said some things with folded hands, Soft whisper'd in the dim sea-sound, And eyes held humbly to the ground, And frail knees sunken in the sands. He had done more than this for me, And yet I could not well do more; I turned me down the olive shore, And set a sad face to the sea. General William Walker, citizen, soldier, president and historian of Nicaragua, was born in Nashville, Tennessee, in 1824, of Scotch ancestry, and educated at a university in Paris, after which he studied international law in London. He voyaged to California in 1850 and, after some experience in the gold mines and gathering many bold men about him he became editor of the San Francisco Herald and began to publish his plans to his followers. He made two bold attempts to establish a settlement in Baja California, but was twice driven out by the Mexicans. Returning to California he raised a company and sailed for Nicaragua. War had been raging there for a long time between the aristocrats, or church party, of Granada, and the Democrats of Leon, to the north. Americans as well as British were fighting on both sides. Colonel Doubleday, whose book on the subject is worth reading, was in the field long before Walker, who went into the country by special invitation from the president of the Democrats, whose capital was at Leon. Here, Doubleday, an English man by birth, joined Walker and, so far as he could, kept at his side to the end. Doubleday says Walker was ambitious, and that in many quiet walks along the silvery beach of Lake Nicaragua he told him of vast plans of conquest, to include Honduras, Mexico and all Central America. And yet, Doubleday, in this same book, tells us that Walker was morose, reserved and had no confidants. True, these accusations were made and published broadcast over the world right along and were not denied; but from Colonel Doubleday's own account of Walker's character he would certainly be the last man to tell the Colonel, or any one else, of any such fatal purpose. I know that I never heard a hint of it from him or any one near him. Still, we must ascribe his downfall to these stories; for he had hardly been seated in the Presidential chair when he found not only the Church party of his own adopted country against him but every little neighboring republic in arms to expel him. After fearful fighting at Granada, Walker, shut up in Rivas, surrendered to the United States and was taken to New Orleans for trial, his men going whither they would or could. He now published an elaborate book, giving the wealth and wonderful resources of the country and, at the same time, giving every detail of the war, under the title of The War in Nicaragua. It is written in the third person, like the books of the first Cæsar, and is as conservative and exact as an equation. He was tried in New Orleans and, on his vindication, raised in that city and Mobile a force far exceeding that with which he had left California and with which he had fought his way to the presidency; but his Californians were dead or scattered, and these untried men of enervating cities knew little of arms and were, comparatively, worthless. Walker's last expedition was closely watched by British gunboats. He took refuge up a river on the coast of Honduras and soon found himself cut off on all sides. He led his men up the coast and down, facing fifty to one, as at Rivas and Granada, but they soon became disheartened and he surrendered to the captain of a British man-of-war, who at once turned him over to Honduras, when he was promptly tried at the drum's head, condemned and shot. General Walker was the cleanest man in word and deed I ever knew. He never used tobacco in any form, never drank anything at all, except water, and always ate most sparingly. He never jested and I cannot recall that I ever saw him smile. He was very thin of flesh and of most impressive presence, especially when on the firing line. At such times he was simply terrible; his gray eyes expanding and glittering like broken steel with the rage of battle. He was, in the eyes of his devoted Californians, truly “The bravest of the brave.” The manner of his death showed not only the true courage but the serene Christian peace and dignity of this “gray-eyed man of destiny.” The priest who attended him in his last moments told me that Walker had no sooner been put in prison than he sent for his spiritual adviser. He knew his fate beforehand. “Father, my political career is ended and I wish to prepare to die.” And even as he spoke to the priest an officer with a platoon of executioners entered the prison to inform him that he was sentenced to be shot. Walker had disdained to make any show of defense for himself, but begged to the last moment that his followers should not be made to suffer. “My men knew nothing of my sudden resolve to reach Nicaragua by way of Truxillo when I found I could not escape the British gunboat. I alone am to blame. I was wrong in making war upon Honduras.” His dress, language and bearing were those of a clergyman, when not on the firing line, and his whole time was spent in reading. He never wasted a moment in idle talk, never took advice but always gave commands, and they must be obeyed. On entering a town he, as a rule, issued a proclamation making death the penalty alike for insulting a woman, for theft or for entering a church save as a Christian should. He lived and died a devout Catholic. “If you will open my heart when I am dead you will see Calais burned there; burned in the very heart of my heart.” I have no warrant for saying that plans for the Nicaraguan canal crowded in upon the last moments of General Walker, for I was not with him in this last expedition, but I know that this one colossal idea towered over, and high above, all his other plans from the first, and even after his surrender to Lieutenant Davis, of the United States Navy, at Rivas. His work as general of the Nicaraguan forces, his plans as President of Nicaragua, all honors, all things that came to him he reckoned as nothing in comparison with this one purpose. The transcontinental canal would make not only Mexico and all the lesser republics tributary to Nicaragua, but all the civilized world as well. He was well known personally in Paris and London, where his position and credit were of the best. He was looked upon in better Europe, not as an adventurer, but as a wise, well-meaning and far-seeing soldier and statesman. America was comparatively poor at that time, and, especially the northern part, hostile to his plans for the betterment of Nicaragua. So it was that he planned and arranged wholly with foreign capital for moneys to do the work. I am not certain that I know exactly, at this remote date, but I feel almost certain that the Rothschilds were to finance the canal and at the same time control the great quicksilver mines in California. I am quite certain, however, that General Walker proposed to bring out many ship loads of the strong Celt, Saxon, and North Sea people to do the work, serve as soldiers and then help populate and civilize the richest and most favored spot of all this earth. I remember how carefully he noted that the health of his men, who were made to take care of themselves, was so much better than that of the native soldiers, who ate and drank, when they ate at all, whatever came to hand. Indeed, it would seem as if we were once miraculously saved from annihilation by breaking out of cholera in the enemy's camp, not ten miles distant. The first real work towards the trans-continental canal was done by George Squier, our Minister to Peru; seconded by Stevens, another learned, able, and enterprising engineer. Five different routes were surveyed, or at least shown to be possible. The first chapters in the story of the great canal, after these two able men had done their work and gone their ways, are far from complimentary to either the wisdom or the worth of most of those concerned. At last the French took hold of the idea, but a treacherous Nicaraguan, high in authority, was bribed and to the consternation and disgust of all who knew anything about the resources and glory of Nicaragua, Panama was preferred. Of course America will now soon complete it. But we must do more than complete the Panama Canal. As a dying queen proffered millions of money for a moment of time, so Commerce, as she comes to possess her full estate, will pay billions of money for a single day, if need be. The Nicaragua route is more than a day shorter in the circuit of the world, as well as between the most important parts. The changeless and all-conquering laws of trade will compel the use of the shorter route; whoever may be its owners. But there is something more than time and trade in the proposition. The world is learning at last to say with Socrates, “Know thyself”: the world wants to see the world and to see it at its best and to see it in its sublimest aspect and place. And the one sublimest place on the face of the earth is the mountains, the forests and the inland seas of Nicaragua. The five mountains of eternal fires beyond Leon, the gleaming, bottomless and flower-hung lakes, the sinuous and forest-swept rivers, the rainbow birds, monstrous reptiles of land and sea, blossoming trees heavy with perfume where mountains of snow and of flame look down on you as you sail by—these the world will see and know at whatever cost, as it comes to its own and comes to know itself. There is grandeur of scene in Canada as you glide by over the iron spans; but it is monotonously grand and cold and lifeless. The gleaming snow peaks of the Oregon Sierra, with their verdant fields, lowing herds and responsive human life, make a good second, but these two most favored parts of scenery under the northern path of the sun are so entirely surpassed by the endless summers in Nicaragua as to make any sort of comparison quite impossible. And so it results that the civilized and seeing world must and will pass that way, as surely as the crowding and ever-conquering battleships of commerce must and will lead that way. If the Panama route proves to be a success, the Nicaragua route will be at once begun. If it proves a failure, this Nicaraguan route must and will be at once pushed to conclusion. And who will build it? England? France? Germany? Russia? Japan? It matters not which of the three or four or five. But Russia, with her millions of money and men and her burning jealousy of the Island Empire, might try to build it; or even Japan with her brave ambition and steel-built walls. And we could and would plead the Monroe Doctrine and fight any one or all of them? We could and would do nothing of the sort. There is a precedent to the contrary. We allowed France to embark in the costly venture and we could not now refuse a like courtesy to any other nation, even if we would. Besides, this Monroe Doctrine is a chain of “glittering generalities” which we have been shaking in the ears of the world without ever having tested its strength in the least. The strongest chain is only as strong as its weakest link. The boldest man in the century just behind us said, “I consider the Monroe Doctrine only a bit of idle bluster.” Then since by earthquakes, sudden floods, tidal waves and uncertain sea levels we may fail at Panama and so tempt some foreign power to invade Nicaragua, and since our success would be a tenfold temptation, what should we do but at once secure the right of way to ourselves, from Nicaragua, and so insure peace and prosperity to all before other nations step in. Cast bread on the waters here and it will surely return an hundred-fold. When we were building the first Pacific railroad no one ever dreamed we would need a second one. But we are building others right along. We must control the second Darien Canal. A great canal must and will be built across Nicaragua. And we this great republic, with its millions and billions, must build it. We have more than a right. We have a Duty! Nicaragua is a healthy country. The water is good, the wood abundant and the people industrious, able and willing to do all the work, so there need be no loss of time or great loss of life in its construction. THE TALE OF THE TALL ALCALDE Shadows that shroud the tomorrow, Glists from the life that's within, Traces of pain and of sorrow, And maybe a trace of sin, Reachings for God in the darkness, And for—what should have been. Stains from the gall and the wormwood, Memories bitter like myrrh, A sad brown face in a fir wood, Blotches of heart's blood here, But never the sound of a wailing, Never the sign of a tear. Where mountains repose in their blueness, Where the sun first lands in his newness, And marshals his beams and his lances, Ere down to the vale he advances With visor erect, and rides swiftly On the terrible night in his way, And slays him, and, dauntless and deftly, Hews out the beautiful day With his flashing sword of silver,— Lay nestled the town of Renalda, Far famed for its stately Alcalde, The iron judge of the mountain mine, With heart like the heart of woman, Humanity more than human;— Far famed for its gold and silver, Fair maids and its mountain wine. The feast was full, and the guests afire, The shaven priest and the portly squire, The solemn judge and the smiling dandy, The duke and the don and the commandante, All, save one, shouted or sang divine, Sailing in one great sea of wine; Till roused, red-crested knight Chanticleer Answer'd and echo'd their song and cheer. Some boasted of broil, encounter, in battle, Some boasted of maidens most cleverly won, Boasted of duels most valiantly done, Of leagues of land and of herds of cattle, These men at the feast up in fair Renalda. All boasted but one, the calm Alcalde: Though hard they press'd from first of the feast, Press'd commandanté, press'd poet and priest, And steadily still an attorney press'd, With lifted glass and his face aglow, Heedless of host and careless of guest— “A tale! the tale of your life, so ho! For not one man in all Mexico Can trace your history two decade.” A hand on the rude one's lip was laid: “Sacred, my son,” the priest went on, “Sacred the secrets of every one, Inviolate as an altar-stone. Yet what in the life of one who must Have lived a life that is half divine— Have been so pure to be so just, What can there be, O advocate, In the life of one so desolate Of luck with matron, or love with maid, Midnight revel or escapade, To stir the wonder of men at wine? But should the Alcalde choose, you know,”— (And here his voice fell soft and low, As he set his wine-horn in its place, And look'd in the judge's care-worn face)— “To weave us a tale that points a moral Out of his vivid imagination, Of lass or of love, or lover's quarrel, Naught of his fame or name or station Shall lose in luster by its relation.” Softly the judge set down his horn, Kindly look'd on the priest all shorn, And gazed in the eyes of the advocate With a touch of pity, but none of hate; Then look'd he down in the brimming horn, Half defiant and half forlorn. Was it a tear? Was it a sigh? Was it a glance of the priest's black eye? Or was it the drunken revel-cry That smote the rock of his frozen heart And forced his pallid lips apart? Or was it the weakness like to woman Yearning for sympathy Through the dark years, Spurning the secrecy, Burning for tears, Proving him human,— As he said to the men of the silver mine, With their eyes held up as to one divine, With his eyes held down to his untouch'd wine: “It might have been where moonbeams kneel At night beside some rugged steep; It might have been where breakers reel, Or mild waves cradle men to sleep; It might have been in peaceful life, Or mad tumult and storm and strife, I drew my breath; it matters not. A silver'd head, a sweetest cot, A sea of tamarack and pine, A peaceful stream, a balmy clime, A cloudless sky, a sister's smile, A mother's love that sturdy Time Has strengthen'd as he strengthens wine, Are mine, are with me all the while, Are hung in memory's sounding halls, Are graven on her glowing walls. But rage, nor rack, nor wrath of man, Nor prayer of priest, nor price, nor ban Can wring from me their place or name, Or why, or when, or whence I came; Or why I left that childhood home, A child of form yet old of soul, And sought the wilds where tempests roll O'er snow peaks white as driven foam. “Mistaken and misunderstood, I sought a deeper wild and wood. A girlish form, a childish face, A wild waif drifting from place to place. “Oh for the skies of rolling blue, The balmy hours when lovers woo, When the moon is doubled as in desire, And the lone bird cries in his crest of fire, Like vespers calling the soul to bliss In the blessed love of the life above, Ere it has taken the stains of this! “The world afar, yet at my feet, Went steadily and sternly on; I almost fancied I could meet The crush and bustle of the street, When from my mountain I look'd down. And deep down in the cañon's mouth The long-tom ran and pick-ax rang, And pack-trains coming from the south Went stringing round the mountain high In long gray lines, as wild geese fly, While mul'teers shouted hoarse and high, And dusty, dusky mul'teers sang— ‘Senora with the liquid eye! No floods can ever quench the flame, Or frozen snows my passion tame, O Juanna with the coal-black eye! O senorita, bide a bye!’ “Environed by a mountain wall, That caped in snowy turrets stood; So fierce, so terrible, so tall, It never yet had been defiled By track or trail, save by the wild Free children of the wildest wood; An unkiss'd virgin at my feet, Lay my pure, hallow'd, dreamy vale, Where breathed the essence of my tale; Lone dimple in the mountain's face, Lone Eden in a boundless waste It lay so beautiful! so sweet! “There in the sun's decline I stood By God's form wrought in pink and pearl, My peerless, dark-eyed Indian girl; And gazed out from a fringe of wood, With full-fed soul and feasting eyes, Upon an earthly paradise. Inclining to the south it lay, And long league's southward roll'd away, Until the sable-feather'd pines And tangled boughs and amorous vines Closed like besiegers on the scene, The while the stream that intertwined Had barely room to flow between. It was unlike all other streams, Save those seen in sweet summer dreams; For sleeping in its bed of snow, Nor rock nor stone was ever known, But only shining, shifting sands, Forever sifted by unseen hands. It curved, it bent like Indian bow, And like an arrow darted through, Yet uttered not a sound nor breath, Nor broke a ripple from the start; It was as swift, as still as death, Yet was so clear, so pure, so sweet, It wound its way into your heart As through the grasses at your feet. “Once, through the tall untangled grass, I saw two black bears careless pass, And in the twilight turn to play; I caught my rifle to my face, She raised her hand with quiet grace And said: ‘Not so, for us the day, The night belongs to such as they.” “And then from out the shadow'd wood The antler'd deer came stalking down In half a shot of where I stood; Then stopp'd and stamp'd impatiently, Then shook his head and antlers high, And then his keen horns backward threw Upon his shoulders broad and broawn, And thrust his muzzle in the air, Snuff'd proudly; then a blast he blew As if to say: ‘No danger there.’ And then from out the sable wood His mate and two sweet dappled fawns Stole forth, and by the monarch stood, Such bronzes, as on kingly lawns; Or seen in picture, read in tale. Then he, as if to reassure The timid, trembling and demure, Again his antlers backward threw, Again a blast defiant blew, Then led them proudly down the vale. “I watch'd the forms of darkness come Slow stealing from their sylvan home, And pierce the sunlight drooping low And weary, as if loth to go. Night stain'd the lances as he bled, And, bleeding and pursued, he fled Across the vale into the wood. I saw the tall grass bend its head Beneath the stately martial tread Of Shades, pursuer and pursued. “‘Behold the clouds,’ Winnema said, ‘All purple with the blood of day; The night has conquer'd in the fray, The shadows live, and light is dead.’ “She turn'd to The Sierra Madre range of mountains comes up to us from way down in Mexico. It passes on up toward the north in all its savage majesty and splendor until it melts into and blends in with the Sierra Nevada Mountains of the north, Sierra Nevada Mountains—mountains of snow; Sierra, series—saw teeth of snow, to be literal and exact. Mount Shasta (Chasti), so named by the French, marked the limit of Spain (Mexico) to the north and the end of the Sierra de Nevada. But the Spanish and Portuguese explorers sailing up the Oregon River gave this same great range of mountains coming up from their Mexico the same name—Sierra—with the deserved additional name, Grande del Nord—Sierra Grande del Nord. This mighty mountain range is finally lost in Canada and Alaska. If you want to speak of any one of these particular divisions you say Sierra this or Sierra that. But the custom, which has become a law, is to say the Sierras when you want to speak of these mountains as a body. The one sublimest mountain view of all the Sierras is the summit and center of the park in the city of Portland, Ore. Here they have seven great snow peaks right at your feet.Shasta gracefully, Around whose hoar and mighty head Still roll'd a sunset sea of red, While troops of clouds a space below Were drifting wearily and slow, As seeking shelter for the night Like weary sea-birds in their flight; Then curved her right arm gracefully Above her brow, and bow'd her knee, And chanted in an unknown tongue Words sweeter than were ever sung. “‘And what means this?’ I gently said ‘I prayed to God, the Yopitone, Who dwells on yonder snowy throne,’ She softly said with drooping head; ‘I bow'd to God. He heard my prayer, I felt his warm breath in my hair, He heard me all my wishes tell, For God is good, and all is well.’ “The dappled and the dimpled skies, The timid stars, the spotted moon, All smiled as sweet as sun at noon. Her eyes were like the rabbit's eyes, Her mien, her manner, just as mild, And though a savage war-chief's child, She would not harm the lowliest worm. And, though her beaded foot was firm, And though her airy step was true, She would not crush a drop of dew. “Her love was deeper than the sea, And stronger than the tidal rise, And clung in all its strength to me. A face like hers is never seen This side the gates of paradise, Save in some Indian Summer scene, And then none ever sees it twice— Is seen but once, and seen no more, Seen but to tempt the skeptic soul, And show a sample of the whole That Heaven has in store. “You might have plucked beams from the moon, Or torn the shadow from the pine When on its dial track at noon, But not have parted us one hour, She was so wholly, truly mine. And life was one unbroken dream Of purest bliss and calm delight, A flow'ry-shored, untroubled stream Of sun and song, of shade and bower, A full-moon'd serenading night. “Sweet melodies were in the air, And tame birds caroll'd everywhere. I listened to the lisping grove And cooing pink-eyed turtle dove, I loved her with the holiest love; Believing with a brave belief That everything beneath the skies Was beautiful and born to love, That man had but to love, believe, And earth would be a paradise As beautiful as that above. My goddess, Beauty, I adored, Devoutly, fervid, her alone; My Priestess, Love, unceasing pour'd Pure incense on her altar-stone. “I carved my name in coarse design Once on a birch down by the way, At which she gazed, as she would say, ‘What does this say? What is this sign?’ And when I gaily said, ‘Some day Some one will come and read my name, And I will live in song and fame, Entwined with many a mountain tale, As he who first found this sweet vale, And they will give the place my name,’ She was most sad, and troubled much, And looked in silence far away; Then started trembling from my touch, And when she turn'd her face again, I read unutterable pain. “At last she answered through her tears, ‘Ah! yes; this, too, foretells my fears: Yes, they will come—my race must go As fades a vernal fall of snow; And you be known, and I forgot Like these brown leaves that rust and rot Beneath my feet; and it is well: I do not seek to thrust my name On those who here, hereafter, dwell, Because I have before them dwelt; They too will have their tales to tell, They too will have their time and fame. “‘Yes, they will come, come even now; The dim ghosts on yon mountain's brow, Gray Fathers of my tribe and race, Do beckon to us from their place, And hurl red arrows through the air At night, to bid our braves beware. A footprint by the clear McCloud, Unlike aught ever seen before, Is seen. The crash of rifles loud Is heard along its farther shore.’ “What tall and tawny men were these, As somber, silent, as the trees They moved among! and sad some way With temper'd sadness, ever they,— Yet not with sorrow born of fear. The shadow of their destinies They saw approaching year by year, And murmur'd not. They saw the sun Go down; they saw the peaceful moon Move on in silence to her rest, Saw white streams winding to the west; And thus they knew that oversoon, Somehow, somewhere, for every one Was rest beyond the setting sun. They knew not, never dream'd of doubt, But turn'd to death as to a sleep, And died with eager hands held out To reaching hands beyond the deep,— And died with choicest bow at hand, And quiver full, and arrow drawn For use, when sweet tomorrow's dawn Should waken in the Spirit Land. “What wonder that I linger'd there With Nature's children! Could I part With those that met me heart to heart, And made me welcome, spoke me fair, Were first of all that understood My waywardness from others' ways, My worship of the true and good, And earnest love of Nature's God? Go court the mountains in the clouds, And clashing thunder, and the shrouds Of tempests, and eternal shocks, And fast and pray as one of old In earnestness, and ye shall hold The mysteries; shall hold the rod That passes seas, that smites the rocks Where streams of melody and song Shall run as white streams rush and flow Down from the mountains' crests of snow, Forever, to a thirsting throng. “Between the white man and the red There lies no neutral, halfway ground. I heard afar the thunder sound That soon should burst above my head, And made my choice; I laid my plan, And childlike chose the weaker side; And ever have, and ever will, While might is wrong and wrongs remain, As careless of the world as I Am careless of a cloudless sky. With wayward and romantic joy I gave my pledge like any boy, But kept my promise like a man, And lost; yet with the lesson still Would gladly do the same again. “‘They come! they come! the pale-face come!’ The chieftain shouted where he stood, Sharp watching at the margin wood, And gave the war-whoop's treble yell, That like a knell on fond hearts fell Far watching from my rocky home. “No nodding plumes or banners fair Unfurl'd or fretted through the air; No screaming fife or rolling drum Did challenge brave of soul to come: But, silent, sinew-bows were strung, And, sudden, heavy quivers hung And, swiftly, to the battle sprung Tall painted braves with tufted hair, Like death-black banners in the air. “And long they fought, and firm and well And silent fought, and silent fell, Save when they gave the fearful yell Of death, defiance, or of hate. But what were feathered flints to fate? And what were yells to seething lead? And what the few and untrained feet To troops that came with martial tread, And moved by wood and hill and stream As thick as people in a street, As strange as spirits in a dream? “From pine and poplar, here and there, A cloud, a flash, a crash, a thud, A warrior's garments roll'd in blood, A yell that rent the mountain air Of fierce defiance and despair, Told all who fell, and when and where. Then tighter drew the coils around, And closer grew the battle-ground, And fewer feather'd arrows fell, And fainter grew the battle yell, Until upon that hill was heard The short, sharp whistle of the bird: Until that blood-soaked battle hill Was still as death, so more than still. “The calm, that cometh after all, Look'd sweetly down at shut of day, Where friend and foe commingled lay Like leaves of forest as they fall. Afar the somber mountains frown'd, Here tall pines wheel'd their shadows round, Like long, slim fingers of a hand That sadly pointed out the dead. Like some broad shield high overhead The great white moon led on and on, As leading to the better land. All night I heard black cricket's trill, A night-bird calling from the hill— The place was so profoundly still. “The mighty chief at last was down, A broken gate of brass and pride! His hair all dust, and this his crown! His firm lips were compress'd in hate To foes, yet all content with fate; While, circled round him thick, the foe Had folded hands in dust, and died. His tomahawk lay at his side, All blood, beside his broken bow. One arm stretch'd out, still over-bold, One hand half doubled hid in dust, And clutch'd the earth, as if to hold His hunting grounds still in his trust. “Here tall grass bow'd its tassel'd head In dewy tears above the dead, And there they lay in crook'd fern, That waved and wept above by turn: And further on, by somber trees, They lay, wild heroes of wild deeds, In shrouds alone of weeping weeds, Bound in a never-to-be-broken peace. “No trust that day had been betrayed; Not one had falter'd, not one brave Survived the fearful struggle, save One—save I the renegade, The red man's friend, and—they held me so For this alone—the white man's foe. “They bore me bound for many a day Through fen and wild, by foamy flood, From my dear mountains far away, Where an adobé prison stood Beside a sulty, sullen, town, With iron eyes and stony frown; And in a dark and narrow cell, So hot it almost took my breath, And seem'd but some outpost of hell, They thrust me—as if I had been A monster, in a monster's den. I cried aloud, I courted death, I call'd unto a strip of sky, The only thing beyond my cell That I could see, but no reply Came but the echo of my breath. I paced—how long I cannot tell— My reason fail'd, I knew no more, And swooning, fell upon the floor. Then months went on, till deep one night, When long thin bars of cool moonlight Lay shimmering along the floor, My senses came to me once more. “My eyes look'd full into her eyes— Into her soul so true and tried, I thought myself in paradise, And wonder'd when she too had died. And then I saw the stripéd light That struggled past the prison bar, And in an instant, at the sight, My sinking soul fell just as far As could a star loosed by a jar From out the setting in a ring, The purpled semi-circled ring That seems to circle us at night. “She saw my senses had return'd, Then swift to press my pallid face— Then, as if spurn'd, she sudden turn'd Her sweet face to the prison wall; Her bosom rose, her hot tears fell Fast as drip moss-stones in a well, And then, as if subduing all In one strong struggle of the soul Be what they were of vows or fears, With kisses and hot tender tears, There in the deadly, loathsome place, She bathed my pale and piteous face. “I was so weak I could not speak Or press my pale lips to her cheek; I only looked my wish to share The secret of her presence there. Then looking through her falling hair, She press'd her finger to her lips, More sweet than sweets the brown bee sips. More sad than any grief untold, More silent than the milk-white moon, She turned away. I heard unfold An iron door, and she was gone. “At last, one midnight, I was free; Again I felt the liquid air Around my hot brow like a sea, Sweet as my dear Madonna's prayer, Or benedictions on the soul; Pure air, which God gives free to all, Again I breathed without control— Pure air that man would fain enthrall; God's air, which man hath seized and sold Unto his fellow-man for gold. “I bow'd down to the bended sky, I toss'd my two thin hands on high, I call'd unto the crooked moon, I shouted to the shining stars, With breath and rapture uncontroll'd, Like some wild school-boy loosed at noon, Or comrade coming from the wars, Hailing his companiers of old. “Short time for shouting or delay,— The cock is shrill, the east is gray, Pursuit is made, we must away. They cast me on a sinewy steed, And bid me look to girth and guide— A caution of but little need. I dash the iron in his side, Swift as the shooting stars I ride; I turn, I see, to my dismay, A silent rider red as they; I glance again—it is my bride, My love, my life, rides at my side. “By gulch and gorge and brake and all, Swift as the shining meteors fall, We fly, and never sound nor word But ringing mustang hoof is heard, And limbs of steel and lungs of steam Could not be stronger than theirs seem. Grandly as in some joyous dream, League on league, and hour on hour, Far, far from keep pursuit, or power Of sheriff or bailiff, high or low, Into the bristling hills we go. “Into the tumbled, clear McCloud, White as the foldings of a shroud; We dash into the dashing stream, We breast the tide, we drop the rein, We clutch the streaming, tangled mane— And yet the rider at my side Has never look nor word replied. “Out in its foam, its rush, its roar, Breasting away to the farther shore; Steadily, bravely, gain'd at last, Gain'd where never a dastard foe Has dared to come, or friend to go. Pursuit is baffled and danger pass'd. “Under an oak whose wide arms were Lifting aloft, as if in prayer, Under an oak, where the shining moon Like feather'd snow in a winter noon Quiver'd, sifted, and drifted down In spars and bars on her shoulders brown: And yet she was as silent still As block stones toppled from the hill— Great basalt blocks that near us lay, Deep nestled in the grass untrod By aught save wild beasts of the wood— Great, massive, squared, and chisel'd stone, Like columns that had toppled down From temple dome or tower crown, Along some drifted, silent way Of desolate and desert town Built by the children of the sun. And I in silence sat on one, And she stood gazing far away To where her childhood forests lay, Still as the stone I sat upon. “I sought to catch her to my breast And charm her from her silent mood; She shrank as if a beam, a breath, Then silently before me stood, Still, coldly, as the kiss of death, Her face was darker than a pall, Her presence was so proudly tall, I would have started from the stone Where I sat gazing up at her, As from a form to earth unknown, Had I possess'd the power to stir. “‘O touch me not, no more, no more; 'Tis past, and my sweet dream is o'er. Impure! Impure! Impure!’ she cried, In words as sweetly, weirdly wild As mingling of a rippled tide, And music on the waters spill'd.... ‘But you are free. Fly! Fly alone. Yes, you will win another bride In some far clime where nought is known Of all that you have won or lost, Or what your liberty has cost; Will win you name, and place, and power, And ne'er recall this face, this hour, Save in some secret, deep regret, Which I forgive and you'll forget. Your destiny will lead you on Where, open'd wide to welcome you, Rich, ardent hearts and bosoms are, And snowy arms, more purely fair, And breasts—who dare say breasts more true? “‘They said you had deserted me, Had rued you of your wood and wild. I knew, I knew it could not be, I trusted as a trusting child. I cross'd yon mountains bleak and high That curve their rough backs to the sky, I rode the white-maned mountain flood, And track'd for weeks the trackless wood. The good God led me, as before, And brought me to your prison-door. “‘That madden'd call! that fever'd moan! I heard you in the midnight call My own name through the massive wall, In my sweet mountain-tongue and tone— And yet you call'd so feebly wild, I near mistook you for a child. The keeper with his clinking keys I sought, implored upon my knees That I might see you, feel your breath, Your brow, or breathe you low replies Of comfort in your lonely death. His red face shone, his redder eyes Were like a fiend's that feeds on lies. Again I heard your feeble moan, I cried—unto a heart of stone. Ah! why the hateful horrors tell? Enough! I crept into your cell. “‘I nursed you, lured you back to life, And when you knew, and called me wife And love, with pale lips rife With love and feeble loveliness, I turn'd away, I hid my face, In mad reproach and such distress, In dust down in that loathsome place. “‘And then I vow'd a solemn vow That you should live, live and be free. And you have lived—are free; and now Too slow yon red sun comes to see My life or death, or me again. Oh, death! the peril and the pain I have endured! the dark, dark stain That I did take on my fair soul, All, all to save you, make you free, Are more than mortal can endure; But flame can make the foulest pure. “‘Behold this finished funeral pyre, All ready for the form and fire, Which these, my own hands, did prepare For this last night; then lay me there. I would not hide me from my God Beneath the cold and sullen sod, But, wrapp'd in fiery shining shroud, Ascend to Him, a wreathing cloud.’ “She paused, she turn'd, she lean'd apace Her glance and half-regretting face, As if to yield herself to me; And then she cried, ‘It cannot be, For I have vow'd a solemn vow, And, God help me to keep it now!’ “I stood with arms extended wide To catch her to my burning breast; She caught a dagger from her side And, ere I knew to stir or start, She plunged it in her bursting heart, And fell into my arms and died— Died as my soul to hers was press'd, Died as I held her to my breast, Died without one word or moan, And left me with my dead—alone. “I laid her warm upon the pile, And underneath the lisping oak I watch'd the columns of dark smoke Embrace her sweet lips, with a smile Of frenzied fierceness, while there came A gleaming column of red flame, That grew a grander monument Above her nameless noble mould Than ever bronze or marble lent To king or conqueror of old. “It seized her in its hot embrace, And leapt as if to reach the stars. Then looking up I saw a face So saintly and so sweetly fair, So sad, so pitying, and so pure, I nigh forgot the prison bars, And for one instant, one alone, I felt I could forgive, endure.” “I laid a circlet of white stone, And left her ashes there alone.... Years after, years of storm and pain, I sought that sacred ground again. I saw the circle of white stone With tall, wild grasses overgrown. I did expect, I know not why, From out her sacred dust to find Wild pinks and daisies blooming fair; And when I did not find them there I almost deem'd her God unkind, Less careful of her dust than I. “But why the dreary tale prolong? And deem you I confess'd me wrong, That I did bend a patient knee To all the deep wrongs done to me? That I, because the prison mould Was on my brow, and all its chill Was in my heart as chill as night, Till soul and body both were cold, Did curb my free-born mountain will And sacrifice my sense of right? “No! no! and had they come that day While I with hands and garments red Stood by her pleading, patient clay, The one lone watcher by my dead, With cross-hilt dagger in my hand, And offer'd me my life and all Of titles, power, or of place, I should have spat them in the face, And spurn'd them every one. I live as God gave me to live, I see as God gave me to see. 'Tis not my nature to forgive, Or cringe and plead and bend the knee To God or man in woe or weal, In penitence I cannot feel. “I do not question school nor creed Of Christian, Protestant, or Priest; I only know that creeds to me Are but new names for mystery, That good is good from east to east, And more I do not know nor need To know, to love my neighbor well. I take their dogmas, as they tell, Their pictures of their Godly good, In garments thick with heathen blood; Their heaven with his harp of gold, Their horrid pictures of their hell— Take hell and heaven undenied, Yet were the two placed side by side, Placed full before me for my choice, As they are pictured, best and worst, As they are peopled, tame and bold, The canonized, and the accursed Who dared to think, and thinking speak, And speaking act, bold cheek to cheek, I would in transports choose the first, And enter hell with lifted voice. “Go read the annals of the North And records there of many a wail, Of marshaling and going forth For missing sheriffs, and for men Who fell and none knew how nor when,— Who disappear'd on mountain trail, Or in some dense and narrow vale. Go, traverse Trinity and Scott, That curve their dark backs to the sun: Go, prowl them all. Lo! have they not The chronicles of my wild life? My secrets on their lips of stone, My archives built of human bone? Go, range their wilds as I have done, From snowy crest to sleeping vales, And you will find on every one Enough to swell a thousand tales. “The soul cannot survive alone, And hate will die, like other things; I felt an ebbing in my rage; I hunger'd for the sound of one, Just one familiar word,— Yearn'd but to hear my fellow speak, Or sound of woman's mellow tone, As beats the wild, imprisoned bird, That long nor kind nor mate has heard, With bleeding wings and panting beak Against its iron cage. “I saw a low-roof'd rancho lie, Far, far below, at set of sun, Along the foot-hills crisp and dun— A lone sweet star in lower sky; Saw children passing to and fro, The busy housewife come and go, And white cows come at her command, And none look'd larger than my hand. Then worn and torn, and tann'd and brown, And heedless all, I hasten'd down; A wanderer, wandering lorn and late, I stood before the rustic gate. “Two little girls, with brown feet bare, And tangled, tossing, yellow hair, Play'd on the green, fantastic dress'd, Around a great Newfoundland brute That lay half-resting on his breast, And with his red mouth open'd wide Would make believe that he would bite, As they assail'd him left and right, And then sprang to the other side, And fill'd with shouts the willing air. Oh, sweeter far than lyre or lute To my then hot and thirsty heart, And better self so wholly mute, Were those sweet voices calling there. “Though some sweet scenes my eyes have seen, Some melody my soul has heard, No song of any maid, or bird, Or splendid wealth of tropic scene, Or scene or song of anywhere, Has my impulsive soul so stirr'd, As those young angels sporting there. “The dog at sight of me arose, And nobly stood with lifted nose, Afront the children, now so still, And staring at me with a will. ‘Come in, come in,’ the rancher cried, As here and there the housewife hied; ‘Sit down, sit down, you travel late. What news of politics or war? And are you tired? Go you far? And where you from? Be quick, my Kate, This boy is sure in need of food.’ The little children close by stood, And watch'd and gazed inquiringly, Then came and climbed upon my knee. “‘That there's my Ma,’ the eldest said, And laugh'd and toss'd her pretty head; And then, half bating of her joy, ‘Have you a Ma, you stranger boy? And there hangs Carlo on the wall As large as life; that mother drew With berry stains upon a shred Of tattered tent; but hardly you Would know the picture his at all, For Carlo's black, and this is red.’ Again she laugh'd, and shook her head, And shower'd curls all out of place; Then sudden sad, she raised her face To mine, and tenderly she said, ‘Have you, like us, a pretty home? Have you, like me, a dog and toy? Where do you live, and whither roam? And where's your Pa, poor stranger boy?’ “It seem'd so sweetly out of place Again to meet my fellow-man. I gazed and gazed upon his face As something I had never seen. The melody of woman's voice Fell on my ear as falls the rain Upon the weary, waiting plain. I heard, and drank and drank again, As earth with crack'd lips drinks the rain, In green to fevel and rejoice. I ate with thanks my frugal food, The first return'd for many a day. I had met kindness by the way! I had at last encounter'd good! “I sought my couch, but not to sleep; New thoughts were coursing strong and deep My wild, impulsive passion-heart; I could not rest, my heart was moved, My iron will forgot its part, And I wept like a child reproved. “I lay and pictured me a life Afar from peril, hate, or pain; Enough of battle, blood, and strife, I would take up life's load again; And ere the breaking of the morn I swung my rifle from the horn, And turned to other scenes and lands With lighten'd heart and whiten'd hands. “Where orange blossoms never die, Where red fruits ripen all the year Beneath a sweet and balmy sky, Far from my language or my land, Reproach, regret, or shame or fear, I came in hope, I wander'd here— Yes, here; and this red, bony hand That holds this glass of ruddy cheer—” “'Tis he!” hiss'd the crafty advocate. He sprang to his feet, and hot with hate He reach'd his hands, and he call'd aloud, “'Tis the renegade of the red McCloud!” Slowly the Alcalde rose from his chair; “Hand me, touch me, him who dare!” And his heavy glass on the board of oak He smote with such savage and mighty stroke, It ground to dust in his bony hand, And heavy bottles did clink and tip As if an earthquake were in the land. He tower'd up, and in his ire Seem'd taller than a church's spire. He gazed a moment—and then, the while An icy cold and defiant smile Did curve his thin and livid lip, He turn'd on his heel, he strode through the hall Grand as a god, so grandly tall, Yet white and cold as a chisel'd stone; He passed him out the adobé door Into the night, and he passed alone, And never was known or heard of more. Byron's Corsair had but four hundred lines when first out, but he finally built it up to about fifteen hundred. The lesson of this poem is that of persistent toil and endeavor. It certainly is not “a little thing dashed off before breakfast,” for it was twice revised and published before its first appearance in London, and has been cut and revised at least half a dozen times since; and is still incomplete and very unsatisfying to the writer, except as to the descriptions. It was my first attempt at telling a story in verse, that was thought worth preserving. It was begun when but a lad, camped with our horses for a month's rest in an old adobe ruin on the Reading Ranch, with the gleaming snows of Mount Shasta standing out above the clouds against the cold, blue north. The story is not new, having been written, or at least lived in every mountain land of intermixed races that has been: a young outlaw in love with a wild mountain beauty, his battles for her people against his own, the capture, prison, brave release, flight, return, and revenge—a sort of modified Mazeppa. But it has been a fat source of feeding for grimly humorous and sensational writers, who long ago claimed to have found in it the story of my early life; and strangely enough I was glad when they did so, and read their stories with wild delight. I don't know why I always encouraged this idea of having been an outlaw, but I recall that when Trelawny told me that Byron was more ambitious to be thought the hero of his wildest poems than even to be king of Greece I could not help saying to myself, as Napoleon said to the thunders preceding Waterloo, “We are of accord.” The only serious trouble about the claim that I made the fight of life up the ugly steeps from a hole in an adobe prison-wall to the foothills of Olympus instead of over the pleasant campus of a college, is at the fact that “our friends the enemy” fixed the date at about the same time in which I am on record as reading my class poem in another land. Besides, I was chosen to the bench on the very ticket when the very sheriff who should have kept me in his adobe prison was elected senator, and by some of the very men of my Mount Shasta with whom I had served in war against these same Indians for whom it is said I sold my birthright. Or did I have a double, and was it the other self who was at college? And is it not possible that I am even now the original and only real Joaquin Murietta? For more than once in the old days I was told (and how pleased I was to hear it said) that no other than Joaquin Murietta could ever ride as I rode. But here again is confusion, even more than the confusion of dates and deeds and names. For his hair was as black as a whole midnight, while mine was the hue of hammered gold. And, after all, was it not my vanity and willingness to be thought Joaquin, rather than pity for the brave boy outlaw, driven to desperation by wrongs too brutal to be told, that made me write of him and usurp his bloody name? Anyhow, I'd rather to-day be Joaquin Murietta, dead or living, than the wretch who got the reward for his alleged taking off. And was Joaquin Murietta really killed when that party of Texans surprised and butchered a band of unarmed Mexicans? Nine men in ten will say not. Mrs. Gale Page, daughter of an early governor of Oregon, told me at Walla Walla, July 5th, 1896, in her own house, that her father, who knew and liked Joaquin, when a miner, had had two letters from him, dated and postmarked Mexico, years after his alleged death. So he certainly was not killed as told. But pity, pity, that men should so foolishly waste time with either me or mine when I have led them into the mighty heart of majestic Shasta. Why yonder, lone as God and white as the great white throne, there looms against the sapphire upper seas a mountain peak that props the very porch of heaven; and yet they bother with and want to torment a poor mote of dust that sinks in the grasses at their feet! Why, I know a single cañon there so deep, so bottomless, and broad and somber that a whole night once housed there and let a gold and silver day glide on and on and over it all the vast day long, and all day long night lay there undiscovered. Yet in this presence there be those who will stoop to look at me, a mere mote at their feet, or on their shoes, and bother to know whether it be a black speck or a white; preferring, however, to find it black. THE ARIZONIAN Come to my sunland! Come with me To the land I love; where the sun and sea Are wed for ever; where the palm and pine Are fill'd with singers; where tree and vine Are voiced with prophets! O come, and you Shall sing a song with the seas that swirl And kiss their hands to that cold white girl, To the maiden moon in her mantle of blue. “And I have said, and I say it ever, As the years go on and the world goes over, 'Twere better to be content and clever, In the tending of cattle and the tossing of clover, In the grazing of cattle and growing of grain, Than a strong man striving for fame or gain; Be even as kine in the red-tipped clover: For they lie down and their rests are rests, And the days are theirs, come sun, come rain, To rest, rise up, and repose again; While we wish, yearn, and do pray in vain, And hope to ride on the billows of bosoms, And hope to rest in the haven of breasts, Till the heart is sicken'd and the fair hope dead— Be even as clover with its crown of blossoms, Even as blossoms ere the bloom is shed, Kiss'd by the kine and the brown sweet bee— For these have the sun, and moon, and air, And never a bit of the burthen of care: Yet with all of our caring what more have we? “I would court content like a lover lonely, I would woo her, win her, and wear her only. I would never go over the white sea wall For gold or glory or for aught at all.” He said these things as he stood with the Squire By the river's rim in the field of clover, While the stream flow'd on and the clouds flew over, With the sun tangled in and the fringes afire. So the Squire lean'd with a kindly glory To humor his guest, and to hear his story; For his guest had gold, and he yet was clever, And mild of manner; and, what was more, he, In the morning's ramble had praised the kine, The clover's reach and the meadows fine, And so made the Squire his friend forever. His brow was brown'd by the sun and weather, And touch'd by the terrible hand of time; His rich black beard had a fringe of rime, As silk and silver inwove together. There were hoops of gold all over his hands, And across his breast in chains and bonds, Broad and massive as belts of leather. And the belts of gold were bright in the sun, But brighter than gold his black eyes shone From their sad face-setting so swarth and dun— Brighter than beautiful Santan stone, Brighter even than balls of fire, As he said, hot-faced, in the face of the Squire:— “The pines bow'd over, the stream bent under, The cabin was cover'd with thatches of palm Down in a cañon so deep, the wonder Was what it could know in its clime but calm; Down in a cañon so cleft asunder By sabre-stroke in the young world's prime, It look'd as if broken by bolts of thunder, And burst asunder and rent and riven By earthquakes driven that turbulent time The red cross lifted red hands to heaven. “And this in that land where the sun goes down, And gold is gather'd by tide and by stream, And the maidens are brown as the cocoa brown, And life is a love and a love is a dream; Where the winds come in from the far Cathay With odor of spices and balm and bay, And summer abideth with man alway, Nor comes in a tour with the stately June, And comes too late and returns too soon. “She stood in the shadows as the sun went down, Fretting her hair with her fingers brown, As tall as the silk-tipp'd tassel'd corn— Stood watching, dark brow'd, as I weighed the gold We had wash'd that day where the river roll'd; And her proud lip curl'd with a sun-clime scorn, As she ask'd, ‘Is she better, or fairer than I?’— She, that blonde in the land beyond, Where the sun is hid and the seas are high— That you gather in gold as the years go by, And hoard and hide it away for her As the squirrel burrows the black pine-burr? “Now the gold weigh'd well, but was lighter of weight Than we two had taken for days of late, So I was fretted, and brow a-frown, I said, half-angered, with head held down— ‘Well, yes, she is fairer; and I loved her first: And shall love her last, come worst to the worst.’ “Her lips grew livid, and her eyes afire As I said this thing; and higher and higher The hot words ran, when the booming thunder Peal'd in the crags and the pine-tops under, While up by the cliff in the murky skies It look'd as the clouds had caught the fire— The flash and fire of her wonderful eyes! “She turn'd from the door and down to the river, And mirror'd her face in the whimsical tide, Then threw back her hair as one throwing a quiver, As an Indian throws it back far from his side And free from his hands, swinging fast to the shoulder When rushing to battle; and, turning, she sigh'd And shook, and shiver'd as aspens shiver. Then a great green snake slid into the river, Glistening green, and with eyes of fire; Quick, double-handed she seized a boulder, And cast it with all the fury of passion, As with lifted head it went curving across, Swift darting its tongue like a fierce desire, Curving and curving, lifting higher and higher, Bent and beautiful as a river moss; Then, smitten, it turn'd, bent, broken and doubled And lick'd, red-tongued, like a forked fire, Then sank and the troubled waters bubbled And so swept on in the old swift fashion. “I lay in my hammock: the air was heavy And hot and threat'ning; the very heaven Was holding its breath; and bees in a bevy Hid under my thatch; and birds were driven In clouds to the rocks in a hurried whirr As I peer'd down by the path for her. “She stood like a bronze bent over the river, The proud eyes fix'd, the passion unspoken. Then the heavens broke like a great dyke broken; And ere I fairly had time to give her A shout of warning, a rushing of wind And the rolling of clouds and a deafening din And a darkness that had been black to the blind Came down, as I shouted ‘Come in! Come in! Come under the roof, come up from the river, As up from a grave—come now, or come never!’ The tassel'd tops of the pines were as weeds, The red-woods rock'd like to lake-side reeds, And the world seemed darken'd and drown'd forever, While I crouched low; as a beast that bleeds. “One time in the night as the black wind shifted, And a flash of lightning stretch'd over the stream, I seemed to see her with her brown hands lifted— Only seem'd to see as one sees in a dream— With her eyes wide wild and her pale lips press'd, And the blood from her brow, and the flood to her breast; When the flood caught her hair as flax in a wheel, And wheeling and whirling her round like a reel; Laugh'd loud her despair, then leapt like a steed, Holding tight to her hair, folding fast to her heel, Laughing fierce, leaping far as if spurr'd to its speed! “Now mind, I tell you all this did but seem— Was seen as you see fearful scenes in a dream; For what the devil could the lighting show In a night like that, I should like to know? “And then I slept, and sleeping I dream'd Of great green serpents with tongues of fire, And of death by drowning, and of after death— Of the day of judgment, wherein it seem'd That she, the heathen, was bidden higher, Higher than I; that I clung to her side, And clinging struggled, and struggling cried, And crying, wakened all weak of my breath. “Long leaves of the sun lay over the floor, And a chipmunk chirp'd in the open door, While above on his crag the eagle scream'd, Scream'd as he never had scream'd before. I rush'd to the river: the flood had gone Like a thief, with only his tracks upon The weeds and grasses and warm wet sand, And I ran after with reaching hand, And call'd as I reach'd, and reach'd as I ran, And ran till I came to the cañon's van, Where the waters lay in a bent lagoon, Hook'd and crook'd like the horned moon. “And there in the surge where the waters met, And the warm wave lifted, and the winds did fret The wave till it foam'd with rage on the land, She lay with the wave on the warm white sand; Her rich hair trailed with the trailing weeds, While her small brown hands lay prone or lifted As the waves sang strophes in the broken reeds, Or paused in pity, and in silence sifted Sands of gold, as upon her grave. “And as sure as you see yon browsing kine, And breathe the breath of your meadows fine, When I went to my waist in the warm white wave And stood all pale in the wave to my breast, And reach'd my hands in her rest and unrest, Her hands were lifted and reach'd to mine. “Now mind, I tell you, I cried, ‘Come in! Come into the house, come out from the hollow, Come out of the storm, come up from the river!’ Aye, cried, and call'd in that desolate din, Though I did not rush out, and in plain words give her A wordy warning of the flood to follow, Word by word, and letter by letter; But she knew it as well as I, and better; For once in the desert of New Mexico When we two sought frantically far and wide For the famous spot where Apaches shot With bullets of gold their buffalo, And she stood faithful to death at my side, I threw me down in the hard hot sand Utterly famish'd, and ready to die; Then a speck arose in the red-hot sky— A speck no larger than a lady's hand— While she at my side bent tenderly over, Shielding my face from the sun as a cover, And wetting my face, as she watch'd by my side, From a skin she had borne till the high noontide, (I had emptied mine in the heat of the morning) When the thunder mutter'd far over the plain Like a monster bound or a beast in pain: She sprang the instant, and gave the warning, With her brown hand pointed to the burning skies, For I was too weak unto death to rise. But she knew the peril, and her iron will, With a heart as true as the great North Star, Did bear me up to the palm-tipp'd hill, Where the fiercest beasts in a brotherhood, Beasts that had fled from the plain and far, In perfectest peace expectant stood, With their heads held high, and their limbs a-quiver. Then ere she barely had time to breathe The boiling waters began to seethe From hill to hill in a booming river, Beating and breaking from hill to hill— Even while yet the sun shot fire, Without the shield of a cloud above— Filling the cañon as you would fill A wine-cup, drinking in swift desire, With the brim new-kiss'd by the lips you love! “So you see she knew—knew perfectly well, As well as I could shout and tell, That the mountain would send a flood to the plain, Sweeping the gorge like a hurricane, When the fire flash'd and the thunder fell. “Therefore it is wrong, and I say therefore Unfair, that a mystical, brown-wing'd moth Or midnight bat should forevermore Fan past my face with its wings of air, And follow me up, down, everywhere, Flit past, pursue me, or fly before, Dimly limning in each fair place The full fixed eyes and the sad, brown face, So forty times worse than if it were wroth! “I gather'd the gold I had hid in the earth, Hid over the door and hid under the hearth: Hoarded and hid, as the world went over, For the love of a blonde by a sun-brown'd lover, And I said to myself, as I set my face To the East and afar from the desolate place, ‘She has braided her tresses, and through her tears Look'd away to the West for years, the years That I have wrought where the sun tans brown; She has waked by night, she has watch'd by day, She has wept and wonder'd at my delay, Alone and in tears, with her head held down, Where the ships sail out and the seas swirl in, Forgetting to knit and refusing to spin. “She shall lift her head, she shall see her lover, She shall hear his voice like a sea that rushes, She shall hold his gold in her hands of snow, And down on his breast she shall hide her blushes, And never a care shall her true heart know, While the clods are below, or the clouds are above her. “On the fringe of the night she stood with her pitcher At the old town fountain: and oh! passing fair. ‘I am riper now,’ I said, ‘but am richer,’ And I lifted my hand to my beard and hair; ‘I am burnt by the sun, I am brown'd by the sea; I am white of my beard, and am bald, may be; Yet for all such things what can her heart care?’ Then she moved; and I said, ‘How marvelous fair!’ She look'd to the West, with her arm arch'd over; ‘Looking for me, her sun-brown'd lover,’ I said to myself, and my heart grew bold, And I stepp'd me nearer to her presence there, As approaching a friend; for 'twas here of old Our troths were plighted and the tale was told. “How young she was and how fair she was! How tall as a palm, and how pearly fair, As the night came down on her glorious hair! Then the night grew deep and my eyes grew dim, And a sad-faced figure began to swim And float by my face, flit past, then pause, With her hands held up and her head held down, Yet face to my face; and that face was brown! “Now why did she come and confront me there, With the flood to her face and the moist in her hair, And a mystical stare in her mavelous eyes? I had call'd to her twice, ‘Come in! come in! Come out of the storm to the calm within!’ Now, that is the reason I do make complain That for ever and ever her face should rise, Facing face to face with her great sad eyes. “I said then to myself, and I say it again, Gainsay it you, gainsay it who will, I shall say it over and over still, And will say it ever; for I know it true, That I did all that a man could do (Some men's good doings are done in vain) To save that passionate child of the sun, With her love as deep as the doubled main, And as strong and fierce as a troubled sea— That beautiful bronze with its soul of fire, Its tropical love and its kingly ire— That child as fix'd as a pyramid, As tall as a tule and pure as a nun— And all there is of it, the all I did, As often happens was done in vain. So there is no bit of her blood on me. ‘She is marvelous young and is wonderful fair,’ I said again, and my heart grew bold, And beat and beat a charge for my feet. ‘Time that defaces us, places, and replaces us, And trenches our faces in furrows for tears, Has traced here nothing in all these years. 'Tis the hair of gold that I vex'd of old, The marvelous flowing, gold-flower of hair, And the peaceful eyes in their sweet surprise That I have kiss'd till the head swam round. And the delicate curve of the dimpled chin, And the pouting lips and the pearls within Are the same, the same, but so young, so fair!’ My heart leapt out and back at a bound, As a child that starts, then stops, then lingers. ‘How wonderful young!’ I lifted my fingers And fell to counting the round years down That I had dwelt where the sun tans brown. “Four full hands, and a finger over! ‘She does not know me, her truant lover,’ I said to myself, for her brow was a-frown As I stepp'd still nearer, with my head held down, All abash'd and in blushes my brown face over; ‘She does not know me, her long lost lover, For my beard's so long and my skin's so brown That I well might pass myself for another.’ So I lifted my voice and I spake aloud: ‘Annette, my darling! Annette Macleod!’ She started, she stopped, she turn'd, amazed, She stood all wonder, her eyes wild-wide, Then turn'd in terror down the dusk wayside, And cried as she fled, ‘The man he is crazed, And he calls the maiden name of my mother!’ “Let the world turn over, and over, and over, And toss and tumble like beasts in pain, Crack, quake, and tremble, and turn full over And die, and never rise up again; Let her dash her peaks through the purple cover, Let her plash her seas in the face of the sun— I have no one to love me now, not one, In a world as full as a world can hold; So I will get gold as I erst have done, I will gather a coffin top-full of gold, To take to the door of Death, to buy— Buy what, when I double my hands and die? “Go down, go down to your fields of clover, Go down with your kine to the pastures fine, And give no thought, or care, or labor For maid or man, good name or neighbor; For I gave all as the years went over— Gave all my youth, my years went over— And a heart as warm as the world is cold, For a beautiful, bright, and delusive lie: Gave youth, gave years, gave love for gold; Giving and getting, yet what have I? “The red ripe stars hang low overhead, Let the good and the light of soul reach up, Pluck gold as plucking a butter-cup: But I am as lead, and my hands are red. “So the sun climbs up, and on, and over, And the days go out and the tides come in, And the pale moon rubs on her purple cover Till worn as thin and as bright as tin; But the ways are dark and the days are dreary, And the dreams of youth are but dust in age, And the heart grows harden'd and the hands grow weary, Holding them up for their heritage. “For we promise so great and we gain so little; For we promise so great of glory and gold And we gain so little that the hands grow cold, And the strained heart-strings wear bare and brittle, And for gold and glory we but gain instead A fond heart sicken'd and a fair hope dead. “So I have said, and I say it over, And can prove it over and over again, That the four-footed beasts in the red-crown'd clover, The piéd and hornéd beasts on the plain That lie down, rise up, and repose again, And do never take care or toil or spin, Nor buy, nor build, nor gather in gold, As the days go out and the tides come in, Are better than we by a thousand-fold; For what is it all, in the words of fire, But a vexing of soul and a vain desire?”This book, in the following lines, was dedicated to Maud, my little daughter in Oregon. Because the skies were blue, because The sun in fringes of the sea Was tangled, and delightfully Kept dancing on as in a waltz, And tropic trees bowed to the seas And bloomed and bore years through and through And birds in blended gold and blue Were thick and sweet as swarming bees, And sang as if in Paradise And all that Paradise was spring— Did I too sing with lifted eyes, Because I could not choose but sing. With garments full of sea winds blown From isles beyond of spice and balm Beside the sea, beneath her palm, She waits, as true as chiseled stone, My childhood's child, my June in May, So wiser than thy father is, These lines, these leaves, and all of this Are thine—a loose, uncouth bouquet— So, wait and watch for sail or sign, A ship shall mount the hollow seas Blown to thy place of blossomed trees, And birds, and song, and summer-shine. I throw a kiss across the sea, I drink the winds as drinking wine, And dream they are all blown from thee— I catch the whispered kiss of thine. Shall I return with lifted face, Or head held down as in disgrace To hold thy two brown hands in mine? England, 1871. THE LAST TASCHASTAS The hills were brown, the heavens were blue, A woodpecker pounded a pine-top shell, While a partridge whistled the whole day through For a rabbit to dance in the chaparral, And a grey grouse drumm'd, “All's well, all's well.” I Wrinkled and brown as a bag of leather, A squaw sits moaning long and low. Yesterday she was a wife and mother, Today she is rocking her to and fro, A childless widow, in weeds and woe. An Indian sits in a rocky cavern Chipping a flint in an arrow head; His children are moving as still as shadows, His squaw is moulding some balls of lead, With round face painted a battle-red. An Indian sits in a black-jack jungle, Where a grizzly bear has rear'd her young, Whetting a flint on a granite boulder. His quiver is over his brown back hung— His face is streak'd and his bow is strung. An Indian hangs from a cliff of granite, Like an eagle's nest built in the air, Looking away to the east, and watching The smoke of the cabins curling there, And eagle's feathers are in his hair. In belt of wampum, in battle fashion An Indian watches with wild desire. He is red with paint, he is black with passion; And grand as a god in his savage ire, He leans and listens till stars are a-fire. All somber and sullen and sad, a chieftain Now looks from the mountain far into the sea. Just before him beat in the white billows, Just behind him the toppled tall tree And woodmen chopping, knee buckled to knee. II All together, all in council, In a cañon wall'd so high That no thing could ever reach them Save some stars dropp'd from the sky. And the brown bats sweeping by: Tawny chieftains thin and wiry, Wise as brief, and brief as bold; Chieftains young and fierce and fiery, Chieftains stately, stern and old, Bronzed and battered—battered gold. Flamed the council-fire brighter, Flash'd black eyes like diamond beads, When a woman told her sorrows, While a warrior told his deeds, And a widow tore her weeds. Then was lit the pipe of council That their fathers smoked of old, With its stem of manzanita, And its bowl of quartz and gold, And traditions manifold. How from lip to lip in silence Burn'd it round the circle red, Like an evil star slow passing (Sign of battles and bloodshed) Round the heavens overhead. Then the silence deep was broken By the thunder rolling far, As gods muttering in anger, Or the bloody battle-car Of some Christian king at war. “'Tis the spirits of my Fathers Mutt'ring vengeance in the skies; And the flashing of the lightning Is the anger of their eyes, Bidding us in battle rise,” Cried the war-chief, now uprising, Naked all above the waist, While a belt of shells and silver Held his tamoos to its place, And the war-paint streaked his face. Women molted from the council, Boys crept backward out of sight, Till alone a wall of warriors In their paint and battle-plight Sat reflecting back the light. “O my Fathers in the storm-cloud!” (Red arms tossing to the skies, While the massive walls of granite Seem'd to shrink to half their size, And to mutter strange replies)— “Soon we come, O angry Fathers, Down the darkness you have cross'd: Speak for hunting-grounds there for us; Those you left us we have lost— Gone like blossoms in a frost. “Warriors!” (and his arms fell folded On his tawny swelling breast, While his voice, now low and plaintive As the waves in their unrest, Touching tenderness confess'd). “Where is Wrotto, wise of counsel, Yesterday here in his place? A brave lies dead down in the valley, Last brave of his line and race, And a Ghost sits on his face. “Where his boy the tender-hearted, With his mother yestermorn? Lo! a wigwam door is darken'd, And a mother mourns forlorn, With her long locks toss'd and torn. “Lo! our daughters have been gather'd From among us by the foe, Like the lilies they once gather'd In the spring-time all aglow From the banks of living snow. “Through the land where we for ages Laid the bravest, dearest dead, Grinds the savage white man's plowshare Grinding sires' bones for bread— We shall give them blood instead. “I saw white skulls in a furrow, And around the cursed plowshare Clung the flesh of my own children, And my mother's tangled hair Trailed along the furrow there. “Warriors! braves! I cry for vengeance! And the dim ghosts of the dead Unavenged do wail and shiver In the storm cloud overhead, And shoot arrows battle-red.” Then he ceased and sat among them, With his long locks backward strown; They as mute as men of marble, He a king upon the throne, And as still as any stone. Then uprose the war chief's daughter, Taller than the tassell'd corn, Sweeter than the kiss of morning, Sad as some sweet star of morn, Half defiant, half forlorn. Robed in skins of stripéd panther Lifting loosely to the air With a face a shade of sorrow And black eyes that said, Beware! Nestled in a storm or hair; With her stripéd robes around her, Fasten'd by an eagle's beak, Stood she by the stately chieftain, Proud and pure as Shasta's peak, As she ventured thus to speak: “Must the tomahawk of battle Be unburied where it lies, O, last war chief of Taschastas? Must the smoke of battle rise Like a storm cloud in the skies? “True, some wretch has laid a brother With his swift feet to the sun, But because one bough is broken, Must the broad oak be undone? All the fir trees fell'd as one? “True, the braves have faded, wasted Like ripe blossoms in the rain, But when we have spent the arrows, Do we twang the string in vain, And then snap the bow in twain?” Like a vessel in the tempest Shook the warrior, wild and grim, As he gazed out in the midnight, As to things that beckon'd him, And his eyes were moist and dim. Then he turn'd, and to his bosom Battle-scarr'd, and strong as brass, Tenderly the warrior press'd her As if she were made of glass, Murmuring, “Alas! alas! “Loua Ellah! Spotted Lily! Streaks of blood shall be the sign, On their cursed and mystic pages, Representing me and mine! By Tonatiu's fiery shrine! “When the grass shall grow untrodden In my war path, and the plow Shall be grinding through this cañon Where my braves are gather'd now, Still shall they record this vow: “War and vengeance! rise, my warrior, Rise and shout the battle sign, Ye who love revenge and glory! Ye for peace, in silence pine, And no more be braves of mine.” Then the war yell roll'd and echoed As they started from the ground, Till an eagle from his cedar Starting, answer'd back the sound, And flew circling round and round. “Enough, enough, my kingly father,” And the glory of her eyes Flash'd the valor and the passion That may sleep but never dies, As she proudly thus replies: “Can the cedar be a willow, Pliant and as little worth? It shall stand the king of forests, Or its fall shall shake the earth, Desolating heart and hearth!” III From cold east shore to warm west sea The red men followed the red sun, And faint and failing fast as he, They knew too well their race was run. This ancient tribe, press'd to the wave, There fain had slept a patient slave, And died out as red embers die From flames that once leapt hot and high; But, roused to anger, half arose Around that chief, a sudden flood, A hot and hungry cry for blood; Half drowsy shook a feeble hand, Then sank back in a tame repose, And left him to his fate and foes, A stately wreck upon the strand. His eyes was like the lightning's wing, His voice was like a rushing flood; And when a captive bound he stood His presence look'd the perfect king. 'Twas held at first that he should die: I never knew the reason why A milder council did prevail, Save that we shrank from blood, and save That brave men do respect the brave. Down sea sometimes there was a sail, And far at sea, they said, an isle, And he was sentenced to exile; In open boat upon the sea To go the instant on the main, And never under penalty Of death to touch the shore again. A troop of bearded buckskinn'd men Bore him hard-hurried to the wave, Placed him swift in the boat; and then Swift pushing to the gristling sea, His daughter rush'd down suddenly, Threw him his bow, leapt from the shore Into the boat beside the brave, And sat her down and seized the oar, And never question'd, made replies, Or moved her lips, or raised her eyes. His breast was like a gate of brass, His brow was like a gather'd storm; There is no chisell'd stone that has So stately and complete a form, In sinew, arm, and every part, In all the galleries of art. Gray, bronzed, and naked to the waist, He stood half halting in the prow, With quiver bare and idle bow. The warm sea fondled with the shore, And laid his white face to the sands. His daughter sat with her sad face Bent on the wave, with her two hands Held tightly to the dripping oar; And as she sat, her dimpled knee Bent lithe as wand or willow tree, So round and full, so rich and free, That no one would have ever known That it had either joint or bone. Her eyes were black, her face was brown, Her breasts were bare and there fell down Such wealth of hair, it almost hid The two, in its rich jetty fold— Which I had sometime fain forbid, They were so richer, fuller far Than any polish'd bronzes are, And richer hued than any gold. On her brown arms and her brown hands Were bars of gold and golden bands, Rough hammer'd from the virgin ore, So heavy, they could hold no more. I wonder now, I wonder'd then, That men who fear'd not gods nor men Laid no rude hands at all on her,— I think she had a dagger slid Down in her silver'd wampum belt; It might have been, instead of hilt, A flashing diamond hurry-hid That I beheld—I could not know For certain, we did hasten so; And I know now less sure than then: Deeds strangle memories of deeds, Red blossoms wither, choked with weeds, And years drown memories of men. Some things have happened since—and then This happen'd years and years ago. “Go, go!” the captain cried, and smote With sword and boot the swaying boat, Until it quiver'd as at sea And brought the old chief to his knee. He turn'd his face, and turning rose With hand raised fiercely to his foes: “Yes, I will go, last of my race, Push'd by you robbers ruthlessly Into the hollows of the sea, From this my last, last resting place. Traditions of my fathers say A feeble few reach'd for this land, And we reach'd them a welcome hand Of old, upon another shore; Now they are strong, we weak as they, And they have driven us before Their faces, from that sea to this: Then marvel not if we have sped Sometime an arrow as we fled, So keener than a serpent's kiss.” He turn'd a time unto the sun That lay half hidden in the sea, As in his hollows rock'd asleep, All trembled and breathed heavily; Then arch'd his arm, as you have done, For sharp masts piercing through the deep. No shore or kind ship met his eye, Or isle, or sail, or anything, Save white sea gulls on dipping wing, And mobile sea and molten sky. “Farewell!—push seaward, child!” he cried, And quick the paddle-strokes replied. Like lightning from the panther-skin, That bound his loins round about He snatch'd a poison'd arrow out, That like a snake lay hid within, And twang'd his bow. The captain fell Prone on his face, and such a yell Of triumph from that savage rose As man may never hear again. He stood as standing on the main, The topmost main, in proud repose, And shook his clench'd fist at his foes, And call'd, and cursed them every one. He heeded not the shouts and shot That follow'd him, but grand and grim Stood up against the level sun; And, standing so, seem'd in his ire So grander than some ship on fire. And when the sun had left the sea, That laves Abrup, and Blanco laves, And left the land to death and me, The only thing that I could see Was, ever as the light boat lay High lifted on the white-back'd waves, A head as gray and toss'd as they. We raised the dead and from his hands Pick'd out some shells, clutched as he lay And two by two bore him away, And wiped his lips of blood and sands. We bent and scooped a shallow home, And laid him warm-wet in his blood, Just as the lifted tide a-flood Came charging in with mouth a-foam: And as we turn'd, the sensate thing Reached up, lick'd out its foamy tongue, Lick' out its tongue and tasted blood; The white lips to the red earth clung An instant, and then loosening All hold just like a living thing, Drew back sad-voiced and shuddering, All stained with blood, a stripéd flood. Tc'hastas; a name given to King John by the French, a corruption of chaste; for he was a pure, just man and a great warrior. He was the king of the Rouge (Red) River Indians of Oregon, and his story is glorious with great deeds in defense of his people. When finally overpowered he and his son Moses were put on a ship at Port Orford and sent to Fort Alcatraz in the Golden Gate. In mid-ocean, these two Indians, in irons, rose up, and, after a bloody fight, took the ship. But one had lost a leg, the other an arm, and so they finally had to let loose the crew and soldiers tumbled into the hold, and surrender themselves again; for the ship was driving helpless in a storm toward the rocks. The king died a prisoner, but his son escaped and never again surrendered. He lives alone near Yreka and is known as “Prince Peg-leg Moses.” A daughter of the late Senator Nesmith sends me a picture, taken in 1896, of the king's devoted daughter, Princess Mary, who followed his fortunes in all his battles. She must be nearly one hundred years old. I remember her as an old woman full forty years ago, tall as a soldier, and most terrible in council. I have tried to picture her and her people as I once saw them in a midnight camp before the breaking out of the war; also their actions and utterances, so like some of the old Israelite councils and prophecies. This was the leading piece in my very first book, “Specimens,” published in Oregon in 1867–8, if I remember rightly. BITS FROM INA, A DRAMA Sad song of the wind in the mountains And the sea wave of grass on the plain, That breaks in bloom foam by the fountains, And forests, that breaketh again On the mountains, as breaketh a main. Bold thoughts that were strong as the grizzlies, Now weak in their prison of words; Bright fancies that flash'd like the glaciers, Now dimm'd like the luster of birds, And butterflies huddled as herds. Sad symphony, wild and unmeasured, Weed warp, and woof woven in strouds Strange truths that a stray soul had treasured, Truths seen as through folding of shrouds Or as stars through the rolling of clouds. Scene I. A Hacienda near Tezcuco, Mexico. Young Don Carlos alone looking out on the moonlit mountain. Don Carlos. Popocatapetl looms lone like an island, Above white cloud-waves that break up against him; Around him white buttes in the moonlight are flashing Like silver tents pitch'd in the fair fields of heaven While standing in line, in their snows everlasting, Flash peaks, as my eyes into heaven are lifted, Like mile-stones that lead to the city Eternal. Ofttime when the sun and the sea lay together, Red-welded as one, in their red bed of lovers, Embracing and blushing like loves newly wedded, I have trod on the trailing crape fringes of twilight, And stood there and listen'd, and lean'd with lips parted, Till lordly peaks wrapp'd them, as chill night blew over, In great cloaks of sable, like proud somber Spaniards, And stalk'd from my presence down night's corridors. When the red-curtained West has bent red as with weeping Low over the couch where the prone day lay dying, I have stood with brow lifted, confronting the mountains That held their white faces of snow in the heavens, And said, “It is theirs to array them so purely, Because of their nearness to the temple eternal”: And childlike have said, “They are fair resting places For the dear weary dead on their way up to heaven.” But my soul is not with you tonight, mighty mountains: It is held to the levels of earth by an angel Far more than a star, earth fallen or unfall'n, Yet fierce in her follies and headstrong and stronger Than streams of the sea running in with the billows. Very well. Let him woo, let him thrust his white whiskers And lips pale and purple with death, in between us; Let her wed, as she wills, for the gold of the graybeard. I will set my face for you, O mountains, my brothers, For I yet have my honor, my conscience and freedom, My fleet-footed mustang, and pistols rich silver'd; I will turn as the earth turns her back on the sun, But return to the light of her eyes never more, While noons have a night and white seas have a shore. Ina, approaching. Ina. “I have come, dear Don Carlos, to say you farewell, I shall wed with Don Castro at dawn of tomorrow, And be all his own—firm, honest and faithful. I have promised this thing; that I will keep my promise You who do know me care never to question. I have mastered myself to say this thing to you; Hear me: be strong, then, and say adieu bravely; The world is his own who will brave its bleak hours. Dare, then, to confront the cold days in their column; As they march down upon you, stand, hew them to pieces, One after another, as you would a fierce foeman, Till not one abideth between two true bosoms.” [Don Carlos, with a laugh of scorn, flies from the veranda, mounts horse, and disappears.] Ina (looking out into the night, after a long silence). How doleful the night hawk screams in the heavens, How dismally gibbers the gray coyote! Afar to the south now the turbulent thunder, Mine equal, my brother, my soul's one companion, Talks low in his sleep like a giant deep troubled; Talks fierce in accord with my own stormy spirit. Scene II. Sunset on a spur of Mount Hood. Lamonte contemplates the scene. Lamonte. A flushed and weary messenger a-west Is standing at the half-closed door of day, As he would say, Good night; and now his bright Red cap he tips to me and turns his face, Were it an unholy thing to say, an angel now Beside the door stood with uplifted seal? Behold the door seal'd with that blood red seal Now burning, spreading o'er the mighty West. Never again shall that dead day arise Therefrom, but must be born and come anew. The tawny, solemn Night, child of the East, Her mournful robe trails o'er the distant woods, And comes this way with firm and stately step. Afront, and very high, she wears a shield, A plate of silver, and upon her brow The radiant Venus burns, a pretty lamp. Behold! how in her gorgeous flow of hair Do gleam a million mellow yellow gems, That spill their molten gold upon the dewy grass. Now throned on boundless plains, and gazing down So calmly on the red-seal'd tomb of day, She rests her form against the Rocky Mountains, And rules with silent power a peaceful world. 'Tis midnight now. The bent and broken moon, All batter'd, black, as from a thousand battles, Hangs silent on the purple walls of heaven. The angel warrior, guard of the gates eternal, In battle-harness girt, sleeps on the field: But when tomorrow comes, when wicked men That fret the patient earth are all astir, He will resume his shield, and, facing earthward, The gates of heaven guard from sins of earth. 'Tis morn. Behold the kingly day now leaps The eastern wall of earth, bright sword in hand, And clad in flowing robe of mellow light, Like to a king that has regain'd his throne, He warms his drooping subjects into joy, That rise renewed to do him fealty, And rules with pomp the universal world. Don Carlos ascends the mountain, gesticulating and talking to himself. Don Carlos. Oh, for a name that black-eyed maids would sigh And lean with parted lips at mention of; That I should seem so tall in minds of men That I might walk beneath the arch of heaven, And pluck the ripe red stars as I pass'd on, As favor'd guests do pluck the purple grapes That hang above the humble entrance way Of palm-thatch'd mountain inn of Mexico. Oh, I would give the green leaves of my life For something grand, for real and undream'd deeds! To wear a mantle, broad and richly gemm'd As purple heaven fringed with gold at sunset; To wear a crown as dazzling as the sun, And, holding up a scepter lightning-charged, Stride out among the stars as I once strode A barefoot boy among the buttercups. Alas! I am so restless. There is that Within me doth rebel and rise against The all I am and half I see in others; And were't not for contempt of coward act Of flying all defeated from the world, As if I feared and dared not face its ills, I should ere this have known, known more or less Than any flesh that frets this sullen earth. I know not where such thoughts will lead me to: I have had fear that they would drive me mad, And then have flattered my weak self, and said The soul's outgrown the body—yea, the soul Aspires to the stars, and in its struggles upward Make the dull flesh quiver as an aspen. Lamonte. What waif is this cast here upon my shore, From seas of subtle and most selfish men? Don Carlos. Of subtle and most selfish men!—ah, that's the term! And if you be but earnest in your spleen, And other sex across man's shoulders lash, I'll stand beside you on this crag and howl And hurl my clenched fists down upon their heads, Till I am hoarse as yonder cataract. Lamonte. Why, no, my friend, I'll not consent to that. No true man yet has ever woman cursed. And I—I do not hate my fellow man, For man by nature bears within himself Nobility that makes him half a god; But as in somewise he hath made himself, His universal thirst for gold and pomp, And purchased fleeting fame and bubble honors, Forgetting good, so mocking helpless age, And rushing roughshod o'er lowly merit, I hold him but a sorry worm indeed; And so have turn'd me quietly aside To know the majesty of peaceful woods. Don Carlos (as if alone). The fabled font of youth led many fools, Zealous in its pursuit, to hapless death; And yet this thirst for fame, this hot ambition, This soft-toned syren-tongue, enchanting Fame, Doth lead me headlong on to equal folly, Like to a wild bird charm'd by shining coils And swift mesmeric glance of deadly snake: I would not break the charm, but win a world Or die with curses blistering my lips. Lamonte. Give up ambition, petty pride— By pride the angels fell. Don Carlos. By pride they reached a place from whence to fall. Lamonte. You startle me! I am unused to hear Men talk these fierce and bitter thoughts; and yet In closed recesses of my soul was once A dark and gloomy chamber where they dwelt. Give up ambition—yea, crush such thoughts As you would crush from hearth a scorpion brood; For, mark me well, they'll get the mastery, And drive you on to death—or worse, across A thousand ruin'd homes and broken hearts. Don Carlos. Give up ambition! Oh, rather than to die And glide a lonely, nameless, shivering ghost Down time's dark tide of utter nothingness, I'd write a name in blood and orphans' tears. The temple-burner wiser was than kings. Lamonte. And would you dare the curse of man and— Don Carlos. Dare the curse of man! I'd dare the fearful curse of God! I'd build a pyramid of whitest skulls, And step therefrom unto the spotted moon, And thence to stars, and thence to central suns. Then with one grand and mighty leap would land Unhinder'd on the shining shore of heaven, And, sword in hand, unbared and unabash'd, Would stand bold forth in presence of the God Of gods, and on the jewel'd inner side The walls of heaven, carve with keen Damascus steel And, highest up, a grand and titled name That time nor tide could touch or tarnish ever. Lamonte. Seek not to crop above the heads of men To be a better mark for envy's shafts. Come to my peaceful home, and leave behind These stormy thoughts and daring aspirations. All earthly power is but a thing comparative. Is not a petty chief of some lone isle, With half a dozen nude and starving subjects, As much a king as he the Czar of Rusk? In yonder sweet retreat and balmy place I'll abdicate, and you be chief indeed. There you will reign and tell me of the world, Its life and lights, its sins and sickly shadows. The pheasant will reveille beat at morn, And rouse us to the battle of the day. My swarthy subjects will in circle sit, And, gazing on your noble presence, deem You great indeed, and call you chief of chiefs; And, knowing no one greater than yourself In all the leafy borders of your realm, 'Gainst what can pride or poor ambition chafe? 'Twill be a kingdom without king, save you, More broad than that the cruel Cortes won, With subjects truer than he ever knew, That know no law but only nature's law, And no religion know but that of love. There truth and beauty are, for there is Nature, Serene and simple. She will be our priestess, And in her calm and uncomplaining face We two will read her rubric and be wise. ... Don Carlos. Why, truly now, this fierce and broken land, Seen through your eyes, assumes a fairer shape. Lead up, for you are nearer God than I. Scene III. Ina, in black, alone. Midnight. Ina. I weep? I weep? I laugh to think of it! I lift my dark brow to the breath of the ocean, Soft kissing me now like the lips of my mother, And laugh low and long as I crush the brown grasses, To think I should weep! Why, I never wept—never, Not even in punishments dealt me in childhood! Yea, all of my wrongs and my bitterness buried In my brave baby heart, all alone and unfriended. And I pitied, with proud and disdainfulest pity, The weak who would weep, and I laugh'd at the folly Of those who could laugh and make merry with playthings. Nay, I will not weep now over that I desired. Desired? Yes: I to myself dare confess it, Ah, too, to the world should it question too closely, And bathe me and sport in a deep sea of candor. Let the world be deceived; it insists upon it: Let it bundle me round in its black woe-garments; But I, self with self—my free soul fearless— Am frank as the sun, nor the toss of a copper Care I if the world call it good or evil. I am glad tonight, and in new-born freedom Forget all earth with my old companions,— The moon and the stars and the moon-clad ocean. I am face to face with the stars that know me, And gaze as I gazed in the eyes of my mother, Forgetting the city and the coarse things in it; For there's naught but God in the shape of mortal, Save one—my wandering, wild boy-lover— That I esteem worth a stale banana. The hair hangs heavy and is warm on my shoulder, And is thick with the odors of balm and of blossom, The great bay sleeps with the ships on her bosom; Through the Golden Gate, to the left hand yonder, The white sea lies in a deep sleep, breathing, The father of melody, mother of measure. Scene IV. A wood by a rivulet on a spur of Mount Hood, overlooking the Columbia. Lamonte and Don Carlos, on their way to the camp, are reposing under the shadow of the forest. Some deer are observed descending to the brook, and Don Carlos seizes his rifle. Lamonte. Nay, nay, my friend, strike not from your covert, Strike like a serpent in the grass well hidden? What, steal into their homes, and, when they, thirsting, And all unsuspecting, come down in couples And dip brown muzzles in the mossy brink, Then shoot them down without chance to fly— The only means that God has given them, Poor, unarm'd mutes, to baffle man's cunning? Ah, now I see you had not thought of this! The hare is fleet, and is most quick at sound, His coat is changed with the changing fields; Yon deer turn brown when the leaves turn brown; The dog has teeth, the cat has talons, A man has craft and sinewy arms: All things that live have some means of defense All, all—save only fair lovely woman. Don Carlos. Nay, she has her tongue; is armed to the teeth. Lamonte. Thou Timon, what can 'scape your bitterness? But for this sweet content of Nature here, Upon whose breast we now recline and rest, Why, you might lift your voice and rail at her! Don Carlos. Oh, I am out of patience with your faith! What! She content and peaceful, uncomplaining? I've seen her fretted like a lion caged, Chafe like a peevish woman cross'd and churl'd, Tramping and champing like a whelpless bear; Have seen her weep till earth was wet with tears, Then turn all smiles—a jade that won her point? Have seen her tear the hoary hair of ocean, While he, himself full half a world, would moan And roll and toss his clumsy hands all day To earth like some great helpless babe, Rude-rock'd and cradled by an unkind nurse, Then stain her snowy hem with salt-sea tears; And when the peaceful, mellow moon came forth, To walk and meditate among the blooms That make so blest the upper purple fields, This wroth dyspeptic sea ran after her With all his soul, as if to pour himself, All sick and helpless, in her snowy lap. Content! Oh, she has cracked the ribs of earth And made her shake poor trembling man from off Her back, e'en as a grizzly shakes the hounds; She has upheaved her rocky spine against The flowing robes of the eternal God. Lamonte. There once was one of nature like to this: He stood a barehead boy upon a cliff Pine-crown'd, that hung high o'er a bleak north sea His long hair stream'd and flashed like yellow silk, His sea-blue eyes lay deep and still as lakes O'erhung by mountains, arch'd in virgin snow; And far astray, and friendless and alone, A tropic bird blown through the north frost wind, He stood above the sea in the cold white moon, His thin face lifted to the flashing stars. He talk'd familiarly and face to face With the eternal God, in solemn night, Confronting Him with free and flippant air As one confronts a merchant o'er his counter, And in vehement blasphemy did say: “God, put aside this world—show me another! God, this world's but a cheat—hand down another! I will not buy—not have it as a gift. Put this aside and hand me down another— Another, and another, still another, Till I have tried the fairest world that hangs Upon the walls and broad dome of your shop. For I am proud of soul and regal born, And will not have a cheap and cheating world.” Don Carlos. The noble youth! So God gave him another? Lamonte. A bear, as in old time, came from the woods And tare him there upon that storm-swept cliff— A grim and grizzed bear, like unto hunger, A tall ship sail'd adown the sea next morn, And, standing with his glass upon the prow, The captain saw a vulture on a cliff, Gorging, and pecking, stretching his long neck Bracing his raven plumes against the wind, Fretting the tempest with his sable feathers. A Young Poet ascends the mountain and approaches. Don Carlos. Ho! ho! whom have we here? Talk of the devil, And he's at hand. Say, who are you, and whence? Poet. I am a poet, and dwell down by the sea. Don Carlos. A poet! a poet, forsooth! A hungry fool! Would you know what it means to be a poet now? It is to want a friend, to want a home, A country, money,—ay, to want a meal. It is not wise to be a poet now, For, oh, the world it has so modest grown It will not praise a poet to his face, But waits till he is dead some hundred years, Then uprears marbles cold and stupid as itself. [Poet rises to go.] Don Carlos. Why, what's the haste? You'll reach there soon enough. Poet. Reach where? Don Carlos. The inn to which all earthly roads do tend: The “neat apartments furnish'd—see within”; The “furnish'd rooms for quiet, single gentlemen”; The narrow six-by-two where you will lie With cold blue nose up-pointing to the grass, Labell'd and box'd, and ready all for shipment. Poet (loosening hair and letting fall a mantle.) Ah me! my Don Carlos, look kindly upon me! With my hand on your arm and my dark brow lifted Full level to yours, do you not now know me? 'Tis I, your Ina, whom you loved by the ocean, In the warm-spiced winds from the far Cathay. Don Carlos (bitterly.) With the smell of the dead man still upon you! Your dark hair wet from his death-damp forehead! You are not my Ina, for she is a memory. A marble chisell'd, in my heart's dark chamber Set up for ever, and naught can change her; And you are a stranger, and the gulf between us Is wide as the plains, and as deep as Pacific. And now, good night. In your serape folded Hard by in the light of the pine-knot fire, Sleep you as sound as you will be welcome; And on the morrow—now mark me, madam— When tomorrow comes, why, you will turn you To the right or left as did Father Abram. Good night, for ever and for aye, good by; My bitter is sweet and your truth is a lie. Ina (letting go his arm and stepping back.) Well, then! 'tis over, and 'tis well thus ended; I am well escaped from my life's devotion. The waters of bliss are a waste of bitterness; The day of joy I did join hands over, As a bow of promise when my years were weary, And set high up as a brazen serpent To look upon when I else had fainted In burning deserts, while you sipp'd ices And snowy sherbets, and roam'd unfetter'd, Is a deadly asp in the fruit and flowers That you in your bitterness now bear to me; But its fangs unfasten and it glides down from me, From a Cleopatra of cold white marble. I have but done what I would do over, Did I find one worthy of so much devotion; And, standing here with my clean hands folded Above a bosom whose crime is courage, The only regret that my heart discovers Is that I should do and have dared so greatly For the love of one who deserved so little. Nay! say no more, nor attempt to approach me! This ten feet line lying now between us Shall never be less while the land has measure. See! night is forgetting the east in the heavens; The birds pipe shrill and the beasts howl answer. EVEN SO Sierras, and eternal tents Of snow that flash o'er battlements Of mountains! My land of the sun, Am I not true? have I not done All things for thine, for thee alone, O sun-land, sea-land, thou mine own? Be my reward some little place To pitch my tent, some tree and vine Where I may sit with lifted face, And drink the sun as drinking wine: Where sweeps the Oregon, and where White storms carouse on perfumed air. In the shadows a-west of the sunset mountains, Where old-time giants had dwelt and peopled, And built up cities and castled battlements, And rear'd up pillars that pierced the heavens, A poet dwelt of the book of Nature— An ardent lover of the pure and beautiful. Devoutest lover of the true and beautiful. Profoundest lover of the grand and beautiful— With heart all impulse, and intensest passion, Who believed in love as in God eternal— A dream while the waken'd world went over, An Indian summer of the singing seasons; And he sang wild songs like the wind in cedars, Was tempest-toss'd as the pines, yet ever As fix'd in faith as they in the mountains. He had heard of a name as one hears of a princess, Her glory had come unto him in stories; From afar he had look'd as entranced upon her; He gave her name to the wind in measures, And he heard her name in the deep-voiced cedars, And afar in the winds rolling on like the billows, Her name in the name of another for ever Gave all his numbers their grandest strophes; Enshrined her image in his heart's high temple, And saint-like held her, too sacred for mortal. He came to fall like a king of the forest Caught in the strong storm arms of the wrestler; Forgetting his songs, his crags and his mountains, And nearly his God, in his wild deep passion; And when he had won her and turn'd him homeward, With the holiest pledges love gives its lover, The mountain route was as strewn with roses. Can high love then be a thing unholy, To make us better and bless'd supremely? The day was fix'd for the feast and nuptials; He crazed with impatience at the tardy hours; He flew in the face of old Time as a tyrant; He had fought the days that stood still between them, Fought one by one, as you fight with a foeman, Had they been animate and sensate beings. At last then the hour came coldly forward. When Mars was trailing his lance on the mountains He rein'd his steed and look'd down in the cañon To where she dwelt, with a heart of fire. He kiss'd his hand to the smoke slow curling, Then bow'd his head in devoutest blessing. His spotted courser did plunge and fret him Beneath his gay silken-fringed carona And toss his neck in a black-mane banner'd; Then all afoam, plunging iron-footed, Dash'd him down with a wild impatience. A coldness met him, like the breath of a cavern, As he joyously hasten'd across the threshold. She came, and coldly she spoke and scornful, In answer to warm and impulsive passion. All things did array them in shapes most hateful, And life did seem but a jest intolerable. He dared to question her why this estrangement: She spoke with a strange and stiff indifference, And bade him go on all alone life's journey. Then stern and tall he did stand up before her, And gaze dark-brow'd through the low narrow casement. For a time, as if warring in thought with a passion; Then, crushing hard down the hot welling bitterness, He folded his form in a sullen silentness, And turned for ever away from her presence; Bearing his sorrow like some great burden, Like a black nightmare in his hot heart muffled; With his faith in the truth of woman broken. 'Mid Theban pillars, where sang the Pindar, Breathing the breath of the Grecian islands, Breathing in spices and olive and myrtle, Counting the caravans, curl'd and snowy, Slow journeying over his head to Mecca Or the high Christ land of most holy memory, Counting the clouds through the boughs above him, That brush'd white marbles that time had chisel'd And rear'd as tombs on the great dead city, Letter'd with solemn but unread moral— A poet rested in the red-hot summer. He took no note of the things about him, But dream'd and counted the clouds above him; His soul was troubled, and his sad heart's Mecca Was a miner's home far over the ocean, Banner'd by pines that did brush blue heaven. When the sun went down on the bronzed Morea, He read to himself from the lines of sorrow That came as a wail from the one he worshipp'd, Sent over the seas by an old companion: They spoke no word of him, or remembrance. And he was most sad, for he felt forgotten, And said: “In the leaves of her fair heart's album She has cover'd my face with the face of another. Let the great sea lift like a wall between us, High-back'd, with his mane of white storms for ever— I shall learn to love, I shall wed my sorrow, I shall take as a spouse the days that are perish'd; I shall dwell in a land where the march of genius Made tracks in marble in the days of giants; I shall sit in the ruins where sat the Marius, Gray with the ghosts of the great departed.” And then he said in the solemn twilight... “Strangely wooing are yon worlds above us, Strangely beautiful is the Faith of Islam, Strangely sweet are the songs of Solomon, Strangely tender are the teachings of Jesus, Strangely cold is the sun on the mountains, Strangely mellow is the moon on old ruins, Strangely pleasant are the stolen waters, Strangely lighted is the North night region, Strangely strong are the streams in the ocean, Strangely true are the tales of the Orient, But stranger than all are the ways of women.” His head on his hands and his hands on the marble, Alone in the midnight he slept in the ruins; And a form was before him white mantled in moonlight, And bitter he said to the one he had worshipp'd— “Your hands in mine, your face, your eyes Look level into mine, and mine Are not abashed in anywise As eyes were in an elden syne. Perhaps the pulse is colder now, And blood comes tamer to the brow Because of hot blood long ago.... Withdraw your hand? .... Well, be it so, And turn your bent head slow sidewise, For recollections are as seas That come and go in tides, and these Are flood tides filling to the eyes. “How strange that you above the vale And I below the mountain wall Should walk and meet! .. Why, you are pale! .. Strange meeting on the mountain fringe! .. .... More strange we ever met at all! .... Tides come and go, we know their time; The moon, we know her wane or prime; But who knows how the heart may hinge? “You stand before me here to-night, But not beside me, not beside— Are beautiful, but not a bride. Some things I recollect aright, Though full a dozen years are done Since we two met one winter night— Since I was crush'd as by a fall; For I have watch'd and pray'd through all The shining circles of the sun. “I saw you where sad cedars wave; I sought you in the dewy eve When shining crickets thrill and grieve; You smiled, and I became a slave. A slave! I worship'd you at night, When all the blue field blossom'd red With dewy roses overhead In sweet and delicate delight. I was devout. I knelt that night To Him who doeth all things well. I tried in vain to break the spell; My prison'd soul refused to rise And image saints in Paradise, While one was here before my eyes. “Some things are sooner marr'd than made. A frost fell on a soul that night, And one was black that erst was white. And you forget the place—the night! Forget that aught was done or said— Say this has pass'd a long decade— Say not a single tear was shed— Say you forget these little things! Is not your recollection loth? Well, little bees have bitter stings, And I remember for us both. “No, not a tear. Do men complain? The outer wound will show a stain, And we may shriek at idle pain; But pierce the heart, and not a word, Or wail, or sign, is seen or heard. “I did not blame—I do not blame, My wild heart turns to you the same, Such as it is; but oh, its meed Of faithfulness and trust and truth, And earnest confidence of youth, I caution, you, is small indeed. “I follow'd you, I worshipp'd you And I would follow, worship still; But if I felt the blight and chill Of frosts in my uncheerful spring, And show it now in riper years In answer to this love you bring— In answer to this second love, This wail of an unmated dove, In cautious answer to your tears— You, you know who taught me disdain. But deem you I would deal you pain? I joy to know your heart is light, I journey glad to know it thus, And could I dare to make it less? Yours—you are day, but I am night. “God knows I would descend to-day Devoutly on my knees, and pray Your way might be one path of peace Through bending boughs and blossom'd trees, And perfect bliss through roses fair; But know you, back—one long decade— How fervently, how fond I pray'd?— What was the answer to that prayer? “The tale is old, and often told And lived by more than you suppose— The fragrance of a summer rose Press'd down beneath the stubborn lid, When sun and song are hush'd and hid, And summer days are gray and old. “We parted so. Amid the bays And peaceful palms and song and shade Your cheerful feet in pleasure stray'd Through all the swift and shining days. “You made my way another way, You bade it should not be with thine— A fierce and cheerless route was mine: But we have met, tonight—today. “You talk of tears—of bitter tears— And tell of tyranny and wrong, And I re-live some stinging jeers, Back, far back, in the leaden years. A lane without a turn is long, I muse, and whistle a reply— Then bite my lips and crush a sigh. “You sympathize that I am sad, I sigh for you that you complain, I shake my yellow hair in vain, I laugh with lips, but am not glad. ... “His was a hot love of the hours, And love and lover both are flown; Now you walk, like a ghost, alone. He sipp'd your sunny lips, and he Took all their honey; now the bee Bends down the heads of other flowers And other lips lift up to kiss. ... ... I am not cruel, yet I find A savage solace for the mind And sweet delight in saying this. ... Now you are silent, white, and you Lift up your hands as making sign, And your rich lips lie thin and blue And ashen ... and you writhe, and you Breathe quick and tremble ... is it true The soul takes wounds, sheds blood like wine? ... “You seem so most uncommon tall Against the lonely ghostly moon, That hurries homeward oversoon, And hides behind you and the pines; And your two hands hang cold and small, And your two thin arms lie like vines, Or winter moonbeams on a wall. ... What if you be a weary ghost, And I but dream, and dream I wake? Then wake me not, and my mistake Is not so bad; let's make the most Of all we get, asleep, awake— And waste not one sweet thing at all. God knows that, at the best, life brings The soul's share so exceeding small We weary for some better things, And hunger even unto death. Laugh loud, be glad with ready breath, For after all are joy and grief Not merely matters of belief? And what is certain after all, But death, delightful, patient death? The cool and perfect, peaceful sleep, Without one tossing hand, or deep Sad sigh and catching in of breath! “Be satisfied. The price of breath Is paid in toll. But knowledge is Bought only with a weary care, And wisdom means a world of pain... Well, we have suffered, will again, And we can work and wait and bear, Strong in the certainty of bliss. Death is delightful: after death Breaks in the dawn of perfect day. Let question he who will: the May Throws fragrance far beyond the wall. “Death is delightful. Death is dawn. Fame is not much, love is not much, Yet what else is there worth the touch Of lifted hand with dagger drawn? So surely life is little worth: Therefore I say, Look up; therefore I say, One little star has more Bright gold than all the earth of earth. “Yea, we must labor, plant to reap— Life knows no folding up of hands— Must plow the soul, as plowing lands; In furrows fashion'd strong and deep. Life has its lesson. Let us learn The hard, long lesson from the birth, And be content; stand breast to breast, And bear and battle till the rest. Yet I look to yon stars, and say: Thank Christ, ye are so far away That when I win you I can turn And look, and see no sign of earth. MYRRH Life knows no dead so beautiful As is the white cold coffin'd past; This I may love nor be betray'd: The dead are faithful to the last. I am not spouseless—I have wed A memory—a life that's dead. Farewell! for here the ways at last Divide—diverge, like delta'd Nile, Which after desert dangers pass'd Of many and many a thousand mile, As constant as a column stone, Seeks out the sea, divorced—alone. And you and I have buried Love, A red seal on the coffin's lid; The clerk below, the court above, Pronounce it dead: the corpse is hid And I who never cross'd your will Consent ... that you may have it still. Farewell! a sad word easy said And easy sung, I think, by some... ... I clutch'd my hands, I turn'd my head In my endeavor and was dumb; And when I should have said, Farewell, I only murmur'd, “This is hell.” What recks it now, whose was the blame? But call it mine; for better used Am I to wrong and cold disdain, Can better bear to be accused Of all that wears the shape of shame, Than have you bear one touch of blame. I set my face for power and place, My soul is toned to sullenness, My heart holds not one sign nor trace Of love, or trust, or tenderness. But you—your years of happiness God knows I would not make them less. And you will come some summer eve, When wheels the white moon on her track, And hear the plaintive night-bird grieve, And heed the crickets clad in black; Alone—not far—a little spell, And say, “Well, yes, he loved me well”; And sigh, “Well, yes, I mind me now, None were so bravely true as he; And yet his love was tame somehow, It was so truly true to me; I wish'd his patient love had less Of worship and of tenderness: “I wish it still, for thus alone There comes a keen reproach or pain, A feeling I dislike to own; Half yearnings for his voice again, Half longings for his earnest gaze, To know him mine always—always.” I make no murmur; steady, calm, Sphinxlike I gaze on days ahead. No wooing word, no pressing palm, No sealing love with lips seal-red, No waiting for some dusk or dawn, No sacred hour ... all are gone. I go alone; no little hands To lead me from forbidden ways, No little voice in other lands To cheer through all the weary days, Yet these are yours, and that to me Is much indeed. ... So let it be. ... ... A last look from my mountain wall. ... I watch the red sun wed the sea Beside your home ... the tides will fall And rise, but nevermore shall we Stand hand in hand and watch them flow, As we once stood. ... Christ! this is so! But, when the stately sea comes in With measured tread and mouth afoam, My darling cries above the din, And asks, “Has father yet come home?” Then look into the peaceful sky, And answers, gently, “By and by.” One deep spring in a desert sand, One moss'd and mystic pyramid, A lonely palm on either hand, A fountain in a forest hid, Are all my life has realized Of all I cherish'd, all I prized: Of all I dream'd in early youth Of love by streams and love-lit ways, While my heart held its type of truth Through all the tropic golden days, And I the oak, and you the vine, Clung palm in palm through cloud or shine. Some time when clouds hang overhead, (What weary skies without one cloud!) You may muse on this love that's dead, Muse calm when not so cold or proud, And say, “At last it comes to me, That none was ever true as he.” My sin was that I loved too much— But I enlisted for the war, Till we the deep-sea shore should touch, Beyond Atlanta—near or far— And truer soldier never yet Bore shining sword or bayonet. I did not blame you—do not blame. The stormy elements of soul That I did scorn to tone or tame, Or bind down unto dull control In full fierce youth, they are all yours, With all their folly and their force. God keep you pure, oh, very pure, God give you grace to dare and do; God give you courage to endure The all He may demand of you,— Keep time frosts from your raven hair, And your young heart without a care. I make no murmur nor complain; Above me are the stars and blue Alluring far to grand refrain; Before, the beautiful and true, To love or hate, to win or lose; Lo! I will now arise, and choose. But should you sometime read a sign, In isles of song beyond the brine, Then you will think a time, and you Will turn and say, “He once was mine, Was all my own; his smiles, his tears Were mine—were mine for years and years.” BURNS Eld Druid oaks of Ayr, Precepts! Poems! Pages! Lessons! Leaves, and Volumes! Arches! Pillars! Columns In corridors of ages! Grand patriarchal sages Lifting palms in prayer! The Druid beards are drifting And shifting to and fro, In gentle breezes lifting, That bat-like come and go. The while the moon is sifting A sheen of shining snow On all these blossoms lifting Their blue eyes from below. No, 'tis not phantoms walking That you hear rustling there, But bearded Druids talking, And turning leaves in prayer. No, not a night-bird singing Nor breeze the broad bough swinging, But that bough holds a censer, And swings it to and fro. 'Tis Sunday eve, remember, That's why they chant so low. I linger in the autumn noon, I listen to the partridge call, I watch the yellow leaflets fall And drift adown the dimpled Doon. I lean me o'er the ivy-grown Auld brig, where Vandal tourists' tools Have ribb'd out names that would be known, Are known—known as a herd of fools. Down Ailsa Craig the sun declines, With lances level'd here and there— The tinted thorns! the trailing vines! O braes of Doon! so fond, so fair! So passing fair, so more than fond! The Poet's place of birth beyond, Beyond the mellow bells of Ayr! I hear the milk-maid's twilight song Come bravely through the storm-bent oaks; Beyond, the white surf's sullen strokes Beat in a chorus deep and strong; I hear the sounding forge afar, And rush and rumble of the car, The steady tinkle of the bell Of lazy, laden, home-bound cows That stop to bellow and to browse; I breathe the soft sea-wind as well. O Burns! where bid? where bide ye now? Where rest you in this night's full noon, Great master of the pen and plow? Might you not on yon slanting beam Of moonlight kneeling to the Doon, Descend once to this hallow'd stream? Sure yon stars yield enough of light For heaven to spare your face one night. O Burns! another name for song, Another name for passion—pride; For love and poesy allied; For strangely blended right and wrong. I picture you as one who kneel'd A stranger at his own hearthstone; One knowing all, yet all unknown, One seeing all, yet all conceal'd; The fitful years you linger'd here A lease of peril and of pain; And I am thankful yet again The gods did love you, plowman! peer! In all your own and other lands, I hear your touching songs of cheer; The lowly peasant, lordly peer, Above your honor'd dust strike hands. A touch of tenderness is shown In this unselfish love of Ayr, And it is well, you earn'd it fair; For all unhelmeted, alone, You proved a plowman's honest claim To battle in the lists of fame; You earn'd it as a warrior earns His laurels fighting for his land, And died—it was your right to go. O eloquence of silent woe! The Master leaning, reach'd a hand, And whisper'd, “It is finish'd, Burns!” O sad, sweet singer of a Spring! Yours was a chill, uncheerful May, And you knew no full days of June; You ran too swiftly up the way, And wearied soon, so over-soon! You sang in weariness and woe; You falter'd, and God heard you sing, Then touch'd your hand and led you so, You found life's hill-top low, so low, You cross'd its summit long ere noon. Thus sooner than one would suppose Some weary feet will find repose. BYRON The little old church where Byron, with all his kindred, are buried, at Hucknall Tokard, Nottes, has been twice torn down and rebuilt since the above was written, although it had stood for centuries little better than a ruin. A wreath of bay was laid above his dust, from Ina D. Coolbrith. The vicar there protested. The matter was appealed to the Bishop. The Bishop answered by sending another wreath. Then the King of Greece sent a wreath. Then the rebuilding began. In men whom men condemn as ill I find so much of goodness still, In men whom men pronounce, divine I find so much of sin and blot, I do not dare to draw a line Between the two, where God has not O cold and cruel Nottingham! In disappointment and in tears, Sad, lost, and lonely, here I am To question, “Is this Nottingham Of which I dream'd for years and years?” I seek in vain for name or sign Of him who made this mold a shrine, A Mecca to the fair and fond Beyond the seas, and still beyond. Where white clouds crush their drooping wings Against my snow-crown'd battlements, And peaks that flash like silver tents; Where Sacramento's fountain springs, And proud Columbia frets his shore Of somber, boundless wood and wold, And lifts his yellow sands of gold In plaintive murmurs evermore; Where snowy dimpled Tahoe smiles, And where white breakers from the sea, In solid phalanx knee to knee, Surround the calm Pacific Isles, Then run and reach unto the land And spread their thin palms on the sand,— Is he supreme—there understood: The free can understand the free; The brave and good the brave and good. Yea, he did sin; who hath reveal'd That he was more than man, or less? Yet sinn'd no more; but less conceal'd Than they who cloak'd their follies o'er, And then cast stones in his distress. He scorn'd to make the good seem more, Or make the bitter sin seem less. And so his very manliness The seeds of persecution bore. When all his songs and fervid love Brought back no olive branch or dove, Or love or trust from any one, Proud, all unpitied and alone He lived to make himself unknown, Disdaining love and yielding none. Like some high-lifted sea-girt stone That could not stoop, but all the days, With proud brow fronted to the breeze, Felt seas blown from the south, and seas Blown from the north, and many ways, He stood—a solitary light In stormy seas and settled night— Then fell, but stirr'd the seas as far As winds and waves and waters are. The meek-eyed stars are cold and white And steady, fix'd for all the years; The comet burns the wings of night, And dazzles elements and spheres, Then dies in beauty and a blaze Of light, blown far through other days. The poet's passion, sense of pride, His boundless love, the wooing throng Of sweet temptations that betide The warm and wayward child of song, The world knows not: I lift a hand To ye who know, who understand. The ancient Abbey's breast is broad, And stout her massive walls of stone; But let him lie, repose alone Ungather'd with the great of God, In dust, by his fierce fellow man. Some one, some day, loud voiced will speak And say the broad breast was not broad, The walls of stone were all too weak To hold his proud dust, in their plan; The hollow of God's great right hand Receives it; let it rest with God. In sad but beautiful decay Gray Hucknall kneels into the dust, And, cherishing her sacred trust, Does blend her clay with lordly clay. No sign or cryptic stone or cross Unto the passing world has said, “He died, and we deplore his loss.” No sound of sandall'd pilgrims' tread Disturbs the pilgrim's peaceful rest, Or frets the proud, impatient breast. The bat flits through the broken pane, The black swift swallow gathers moss, And builds in peace above his head, Then goes, then comes, and builds again. And it is well; not otherwise Would he, the grand sad singer, will. The serene peace of paradise He sought—'tis his—the storm is still. Secure in his eternal fame, And blended pity and respect, He does not feel the cold neglect,— And England does not fear the shame. KIT CARSON'S RIDE Room! room to turn round in, to breathe and be free, To grow to be giant, to sail as at sea With the speed of the wind on a steed with his mane To the wind, without pathway or route or a rein. Room! room to be free where the white border'd sea Blows a kiss to a brother as boundless as he; Where the buffalo come like a cloud on the plain, Pouring on like the tide of a storm-driven main, And the lodge of the hunter to friend or to foe Offers rest; and unquestion'd you come or you go. My plains of America! Seas of wild lands! From a land in the seas in a raiment of foam, That has reached to a stranger the welcome of home, I turn to you, lean to you, lift you my hands. Run? Run? See this flank, sir, and I do love him so! But he's blind, badger blind. Whoa, Pache, boy, whoa. No, you wouldn't believe it to look at his eyes, But he's blind, badger blind, and it happen'd this wise: “We lay in the grass and the sunburnt clover That spread on the ground like a great brown cover Northward and southward, and west and away To the Brazos, where our lodges lay, One broad and unbroken level of brown. We were waiting the curtains of night to come down To cover us trio and conceal our flight With my brown bride, won from an Indian town That lay in the rear the full ride of a night. “We lounged in the grass—her eyes were in mine, And her hands on my knee, and her hair was as wine In its wealth and its flood, pouring on and all over Her bosom wine red, and press'd never by one Her touch was as warm as the tinge of the clover Burnt brown as it reach'd to the kiss of the sun. Her words they were low as the lute-throated dove, And as laden with love as the heart when it beats In its hot, eager answer to earliest love, Or the bee hurried home by its burthen of sweets. “We lay low in the grass on the broad plain levels, Old Revels and I, and my stolen brown bride; “Forty full miles if a foot to ride! Forty full miles if a foot, and the devils Of red Comanches are hot on the track When once they strike it. Let the sun go down Soon, very soon,” muttered bearded old Revels As he peer'd at the sun, lying low on his back, Holding fast to his lasso. Then he jerk'd at his steed And he sprang to his feet, and glanced swiftly around, And then dropp'd, as if shot, with an ear to the ground; Then again to his feet, and to me, to my bride, While his eyes were like flame, his face like a shroud, His form like a king, and his beard like a cloud, And his voice loud and shrill, as both trumpet and reed,— “Pull, pull in your lassoes, and bridle to steed, And speed you if ever for life you would speed. Aye, ride for your lives, for your lives you must ride! For the plain is aflame, the prairie on fire, And the feet of wild horses hard flying before I heard like a sea breaking high on the shore, While the buffalo come like a surge of the sea, Driven far by the flame, driving fast on us three As a hurricane comes, crushing palms in his ire.” “We drew in the lassoes, seized saddle and rein, Threw them on, cinched them on, cinched them over again, And again drew the girth; and spring we to horse, With head to the Brazos, with a sound in the air Like the surge of a sea, with a flash in the eye, From that red wall of flame reaching up to the sky; A red wall of flame and a black rolling sea Rushing fast upon us, as the wind sweeping free And afar from the desert blown hollow and hoarse. “Not a word, not a wail from a lip was left fall, We broke not a whisper, we breathed not a prayer, There was work to be done, there was death in the air, And the chance was as one to a thousand for all. Twenty miles! ... thirty miles! ... a dim distant speck ... Then a long reaching line, and the Brazos in sight! And I rose in my seat with a shout of delight. I stood in my stirrup, and look'd to my right— But Revels was gone; I glanced by my shoulder And saw his horse stagger; I saw his head drooping Hard down on his breast, and his naked breast stooping Low down to the mane, as so swifter and bolder Ran reaching out for us the red-footed fire. He rode neck to neck with a buffalo bull, That made the earth shake where he came in his course, The monarch of millions, with shaggy mane full Of smoke and of dust, and it shook with desire Of battle, with rage and with bellowings hoarse. His keen, crooked horns, through the storm of his mane, Like black lances lifted and lifted again; And I looked but this once, for the fire licked through, And Revels was gone, as we rode two and two. “I look'd to my left then—and nose, neck, and shoulder Sank slowly, sank surely, till back to my thighs, And up through the black blowing veil of her hair Did beam full in mine her two marvelous eyes, With a longing and love yet a look of despair And of pity for me, as she felt the smoke fold her, And flames leaping far for her glorious hair. Her sinking horse falter'd, plunged, fell and was gone As I reach'd through the flame and I bore her still on. On! into the Brazos, she, Pache and I— Poor, burnt, blinded Pache. I love him ... That's why.” And here a few confidential lines for close friends: With better fortunes when my first London book was out, I had taken rooms at Museum Street, a few doors from the greatest store-house of art and history on the globe, and I literally lived in the British Museum every day. But I had already overtaxed my strength, and my eyes were paining terribly. Never robust, I had always abhorred meat; and milk, from a child, had been my strongest drink. In the chill damp of London you must eat and drink. I was, without knowing it, starving and working myself to death. Always and wherever you are, when a hard bit of work is done, rest and refresh. Go to the fields, woods, to God and get strong. This is your duty as well as your right. Letters—sweet, brave, good letters from the learned and great—were so many I could not read them with my poor eyes and had to leave them to friends. They found two from the Archbishop of Dublin. I was to breakfast with him to meet Browning, Dean Stanley, Houghton, and so on. I went to an old Jew close by to hire a dress suit, as Franklin had done for the Court of St. James. While fitting on the clothes I told him I was in haste to go to a great breakfast. He stopped, looked at me, looked me all over, and then told me I must not wear that, but he would hire me a suit of velvet. By degrees, as he fixed me up, he got at, or guessed at some facts, and when I asked to pay him he shook his head. I put some money down and he pushed it back. He said he had a son, his only family now, at Oxford, and he kept on fixing me up; cane, great, tall silk hat, gloves and all. Who would have guessed the heart to be found there? Browning was just back from Italy, sunburnt and ruddy. “Robert, you are browning,” smiled Lady Augusta. “And you are August—a,” bowed the great poet grandly; and, by what coincidence—he, too, was in brown velvet, and so like my own that I was a bit uneasy. Two of the Archbishop's beautiful daughters had been riding in the park with the Earl of Aberdeen. “And did you gallop?” asked Browning of the younger beauty. “I galloped, Joyce galloped, we galloped all three.” Then we all laughed at the happy and hearty retort, and Browning, beating the time and clang of galloping horses' feet on the table with his fingers, repeated the exact measure in Latin from Virgil; and the Archbishop laughingly took it up, in Latin, where he left off. I then told Browning I had an order—it was my first—for a poem from the Oxford Magazine, and would like to borrow the measure and spirit of his “Good News” for a prairie fire on the plains, driving buffalo and all other life before it into a river. “Why not borrow from Virgil, as I did? He is as rich as one of your gold mines, while I am but a poor scribe.” And this was my first of inner London. Fast on top of this came breakfasts with Lord Houghton, lunch with Browning, a dinner with Rossetti to meet the great painters; the good old Jew garmenting me always, and always pushing back the pay. Let me here note some things my new poets that you should not do; then some that you must. The random notes of this book will serve you better than all the letters I could ever write you. Spend no time or strength finding fault with a fellow scribe. I know but little of prize fighters or pirates of the high seas, but from what I am told they are far more courteous to one another than are American authors, except in sets and little circles. If you feel a bitterness my young poet toward some one more favored at this time than yourself, pray God to send some good angel to lay you on your back, as is told in the story of Islam's prophet, and take the black drop from your heart, for it will make you not only weak and worthless if it remain, but it will make you certainly miserable. If you cannot learn to see beauty and love beauty in the life and work of Nature, then, believe me, you were not born to the sweetness of song. If you must find faults find them in your own work. I have done this, and it has kept me busy. Nor shall you to the extent of its newness, scorn a new character, mistake character for eccentricity. Our work, the calling of the poet, is the highest under the stars, so are his triumphs the rarest; and he who would despoil him would despoil the dead. Nor shall you bewail the afflictions of your flesh. That is old, old; and has been done perfectly. The man who intrudes the weakness of his body is a bore. Let him, if he must, sing the weakness of his mind. But when “he putteth off his armor,” then, and not till then, may he tell the pain and peril of his fight. This poem, “Kit Carson,” was not in any of my four first books, and so has not been rightly revised till now. It was too long for the tumultuous and swift action; and then the end was coarse and unworthy the brave spirit of Kit Carson. I have here cut and changed it much; as I cut and changed all the matter of my three preceding books in London when I cut and compressed all I had done worth preserving into the Songs of the Sierras. OYE-AGUA: OREGON My brave world-builders of the West! Why, who doth know ye? Who shall know But I, that on thy peaks of snow Brake bread the first? Who loves ye best? Who holds ye still, of more stern worth Than all proud peoples of the earth? Yea, I, the rhymer of wild rhymes, Indifferent of blame or praise, Still sing of ye, as one who plays The same sweet air in all strange climes— The same wild, piercing highland air, Because—because, his heart is there. “Here are the continuous woods; here rolls the Oregon and hears no sound save its own dashing.” If there is a statelier name in all our constellation of stars, I have not heard it. Alabama—Here we rest—is sweet, attractive, restful, but the name has not the rush of waters, the misty tang of mold and sombre wood, of cloud-tossing trees, the strength, the stir, the color of Oregon: Oye-agua. It is high time that some one should make clear the root of this great name; the written story of its origin. For it appealed to the poet Bryant most effectively, as well as many others, John Hay especially. For more than thirty years I have made eager inquiry for evidence as to when and by whom in the earliest expeditions the stately names Sierra Grande del Nord and Oye-agua were bequeathed us on the North Pacific sea bank, but I am today empty handed. The letters I had received from the poet Bryant and John Hay and others were destroyed in the San Francisco fire. I had placed them for greater safety in the library of the Bohemian Club, along with autograph copies of books from eminent authors all over the world. I have not had heart to seriously take up the subject since. But I think the noble name speaks very plainly for itself and needs no written evidence of its etymology. Oye-el-agua: Hear the Water! Oye-agua: OREGON: Or-e-gon! In 1858, while teaching a sort of primer school, below Fort Vancouver, during vacation at Columbia College, the forerunner of the Oregon University, I met Father Broulette, the head of the Catholic School at Vancouver. This learned and kindly priest helped me in my Latin, when I went to him on Saturdays, and twice took me rowing in an Indian's canoe far up the great Oregon River to hear the waters; to hear the waters dashing down out of the clouds from the melting snows of Mount Hood. And he quoted Bryant's poem and laid great stress on the words: “Where rolls the Oregon and hears no sound save its own dashing.” We could hear—you can today—hear something more than the dashing waters of the Oregon, that forget the precipitous steeps and sweep away out like a younger Yosemite, a broad, blowing Bridal Veil, till it trails in a lustrous white mist over the mighty river's tranquil breast! You hear something more than the dashing waters. You hear an aeolian harp in the heavens. Now low, now high, as the winds sweep the snow-white bridal veil of broken mist to and fro, till you are ready to say, with the good old priest, “You hear away up yonder in the clouds, an orchestra of angels. Oye-agua, Or-e-gon!” And when called to address the students of the State University about Oregon, a land I have known and loved longer than most of you have lived, gave the root and definition of this beautiful word, for so many foolish and unfair things have been said about its etymology. But, alas! What evidence have I now at hand, further than that written on the face of the waters and heard in the clouds from the stupendous steeps? I appealed to Lummis, Librarian at Los Angeles, Editor of “Out West” and our most learned man in Spanish here, but he has given me no light, save to deride the accepted idea that the name came from the Spanish word “Orejones,” big ears, and to prefer the name “Oregono,” or sage; artemesia. But these early Spanish explorers knew nothing at all of our sage, or artemisia, beyond the mountains, and these great navigators who discovered us gave their beautiful names only from what they saw and heard. Here is what the learned Mr. Lummis says: Los Angeles, Cal., May 6, 1907. Dear Old Joaquin:—? ? ? The Spanish derivation won't work for a minute on “aure el agua.” It is not aure, but oye; Gannett's definition for Oregones is also fly-blown, since that is not the Spanish word for big ears, which is Orejones (sounded h). There is a possibility, of course, that the region may have been named for the Oregon tribe. ? ? ? So far as I know, its etymology has never been satisfactorily settled; but I am making inquiries at once to see if there is any more recent knowledge, and, if so, will let you know at the first possible date. The general conception is that the name comes from the Oregono, or sage; but that is also doubtful. With all good wishes, Always, Your friend, Chas. F. Lummis. As for the offensive name, “Big Ears,” that is simply out of nature and therefore impossible. We have the Nez Perce: Pierce nose, the Pend d'aureille, ears with pendants, or earrings, but all our Indians have ever had notably small ears, small hands, small feet. The learned Spanish professor at the University of California is also in doubt as to the definition of our name, but will not dispute Oye-agua: hear the waters. When John Hay was Secretary of our Spanish Legation at Madrid, and writing his “Castilian Days,” I laid the case before him once, when on a friendly visit, and proposed that we reach some result, but he protested that it would be wasted time to glean where Washington Irving had harvested, and at once quoted Bryant when I spoke of the waters dashing down out of the clouds. And John Hay, the great poet by nature, but the enforced great diplomat, said: “Let the waters dashing down out of heaven speak for themselves. I think it no stretch of imagination to submit that they are forever crying out to the clouds, like the prophets in the wilderness, ‘Oye-agua, Oye-agua! Oregon!’” To understand the importance of Mr. Hay's words, we must know that he not only knew Spanish, but the Spanish Christian in these explorations of conquest. These men were mightily in earnest, and when they could not follow their calendar of saints, which they did as a rule, they named things from sound or color, or conspicuous features, as they found them. They rarely named anything after their revered men and women, as did the French and notably the English; they never jested with the names of places and things. They gave thousands and thousands of names, from the Straits of Magellan to the Straits of Vitus Behring, but you search in vain for one single such name as California's “Calamity Jane,” “Yuba Dam River” or “Give a Damn Gulch.” As Bryant, the poet, wrote; as Hay, the poet, said: “They heard, they saw the dashing of the waters down out of heaven, and they said, ‘Hear the waters! Oye-agua! Oregon.’ And Oregon it is, and Oregon it must and will remain!” It would seem that Washington Irving, so long our minister at Madrid, should have found some record there, while mousing among the archives for material, but you search in vain for light in all his happy pages. But where did the boy poet, Bryant, come upon the pretty, poetic word, “Oregon”? And where did he find warrant to say, nearly a century ago, “Where rolls the Oregon and hears no sound save its own dashing”? The poetry here is so perfect, the description, both sound and sense, so exact—and true poetry is the purest form of truth—that I know Oye-agua means Oregon, as I know Cape Blanco is Cape Blanco, because it looks it, lives it. SIERRA GRANDE DEL NORTE Like fragments of an uncompleted world, From bleak Alaska, bound in ice and spray, To where the peaks of Darien lie curl'd In clouds, the broken lands loom bold and gray. The seamen nearing San Francisco Bay Forget the compass here; with sturdy hand They seize the wheel, look up, then bravely lay The ship to shore by rugged peaks that stand The stern and proud patrician fathers of the land. They stand white stairs of heaven,—stand a line Of lifting, endless, and eternal white. They look upon the far and flashing brine, Upon the boundless plains, the broken height Of Kamiakin's battlements. The flight Of time is underneath their untopp'd towers. They seem to push aside the moon at night, To jostle and to loose the stars. The flowers Of heaven fall about their brows in shining showers. They stand in line of lifted snowy isles High held above the toss'd and tumbled sea,— A sea of wood in wild unmeasured miles: White pyramids of Faith where man is free; White monuments of Hope that yet shall be The mounts of matchless and immortal song ... I look far down the hollow days; I see The bearded prophets simple-soul'd and strong, That strike the sounding harp and thrill the heeding throng. Serene and satisfied! supreme! as lone As God, they loom like God's archangels churl'd; They look as cold as kings upon a throne; The mantling wings of night are crush'd and curl'd As feathers curl. The elements are hurl'd From off their bosoms, and are bidden go, Like evil spirits, to an under-world. They stretch from Cariboo to Mexico, A line of battle-tents in everlasting snow. EXODUS FOR OREGON A tale half told and hardly understood; The talk of bearded men that chanced to meet, That lean'd on long quaint rifles in the wood, That look'd in fellow faces, spoke discreet And low, as half in doubt and in defeat Of hope; a tale it was of lands of gold That lay below the sun. Wind-wing'd and fleet It spread among the swift Missouri's bold Unbridled men, and reach'd to where Ohio roll'd. Then long chain'd lines of yoked and patient steers; Then long white trains that pointed to the west, Beyond the savage west; the hopes and fears Of blunt, untutor'd men, who hardly guess'd Their course; the brave and silent women, dress'd In homely spun attire, the boys in bands, The cheery babes that laugh'd at all, and bless'd The doubting hearts, with laughing lifted hands! ... What exodus for far untraversed lands! The Plains! The shouting drivers at the wheel; The crash of leather whips; the crush and roll Of wheels; the groan of yokes and grinding steel And iron chain, and lo! at last the whole Vast line, that reach'd as if to touch the goal, Began to stretch and stream away and wind Toward the west, as if with one control; Then hope loom'd fair, and home lay far behind; Before, the boundless plain, and fiercest of their kind. At first the way lay green and fresh as seas, And far away as any reach of wave; The sunny streams went by in belt of trees; And here and there the tassell'd tawny brave Swept by on horse, look'd back, stretch'd forth and gave A yell of warn, and then did wheel and rein Awhile, and point away, dark-brow'd and grave, Into the far and dim and distant plain With signs and prophecies, and then plunged on again. Some hills at last began to lift and break; Some streams began to fail of wood and tide, The somber plain began betime to take A hue of weary brown, and wild and wide It stretch'd its naked breast on every side. A babe was heard at last to cry for bread Amid the deserts; cattle low'd and died, And dying men went by with broken tread, And left a long black serpent line of wreck and dead. Strange hunger'd birds, black-wing'd and still as death, And crown'd of red with hooked beaks, blew low And close about, till we could touch their breath— Strange unnamed birds, that seem'd to come and go In circles now, and now direct and slow, Continual, yet never touch the earth; Slim foxes slid and shuttled to and fro At times across the dusty weary dearth Of life, look'd back, then sank like crickets in a hearth. Then dust arose, a long dim line like smoke From out of riven earth. The wheels went groaning by, Ten thousand feet in harness and in yoke, They tore the ways of ashen alkali, And desert winds blew sudden, swift and dry. The dust! it sat upon and fill'd the train! It seem'd to fret and fill the very sky. Lo! dust upon the beasts, the tent, the plain, And dust, alas! on breasts that rose not up again. They sat in desolation and in dust By dried-up desert streams; the mother's hands Hid all her bended face; the cattle thrust Their tongues and faintly call'd across the lands. The babes, that knew not what this way through sands Could mean, did ask if it would end today ... The panting wolves slid by, red-eyed, in bands To pools beyond. The men look'd far away, And, silent, saw that all a boundless desert lay. They rose by night; they struggled on and on As thin and still as ghosts; then here and there Beside the dusty way before the dawn, Men silent laid them down in their despair, And died. But woman! Woman, frail as fair! May man have strength to give to you your due; You falter'd not, nor murmur'd anywhere, You held your babes, held to your course, and you Bore on through burning hell your double burdens through. Men stood at last, the decimated few, Above a land of running streams, and they? They push'd aside the boughs, and peering through Beheld afar the cool, refreshing bay; Then some did curse, and some bend hands to pray; But some look'd back upon the desert, wide And desolate with death, then all the day They mourned. But one, with nothing left beside His dog to love, crept down among the ferns and died. THE HEROES OF OREGON I stand upon the green Sierra's wall; Against the east, beyond the yellow grass, I see the broken hill-tops lift and fall, Then sands that shimmer like a sea of glass ... There lies the nation's great high road of dead. Forgotten aye, unnumbered, and, alas! Unchronicled in deed or death; instead, The new aristocrat lifts high a lordly head. My brave and unremember'd heroes, rest; You fell in silence, silent lie and sleep. Sleep on unsung, for this, I say, were best: The world today has hardly time to weep; The world today will hardly care to keep In heart her plain and unpretending brave. The desert winds, they whistle by and sweep About you; brown'd and russet grasses wave Along a thousand leagues that lie one common grave. The proud and careless pass in palace car Along the line you blazon'd white with bones; Pass swift to people, and possess and mar Your lands with monuments and letter'd stones Unto themselves. Thank God! this waste disowns Their touch. His everlasting hand has drawn A shining line around you. Wealth bemoans The waste your splendid grave employs. Sleep on, No hand shall touch your dust this side of God and dawn. I let them stride across with grasping hands And strive for brief possession; mark and line With lifted walls the new divided lands, And gather growing herds of lowing kine. I could not covet these, could not confine My heart to one; all seem'd to me the same, And all below my mountain home, divine And beautiful, held in another's name, As if the herds and lands were mine, All mine, or his, all beautiful the same. I have not been, shall not be, understood; I have not wit, nor will, to well explain, But that which men call good I find not good. The lands the savage held, shall hold again, The gold the savage spurn'd in proud disdain For centuries; go, take them all; build high Your gilded temples; strive and strike and strain And crowd and controvert and curse and lie In church and State, in town and citadel, and ... die. And who shall grow the nobler from it all? The mute and unsung savage loved as true,— He felt, as grateful felt, God's blessings fall About his lodge and tawny babes as you In temples,—Moslem, Christian, infidel, or Jew. ... The sea, the great white, braided, bounding sea, Is laughing in your face; the arching blue Remains to God; the mountains still are free, A refuge for the few remaining tribes and me. Your cities! from the first the hand of God Has been against them; sword and flood and flame, The earthquake's march, and pestilence, have trod To undiscerning dust the very name Of antique capitals; and still the same Sad destiny besets the battle-fields Of Mammon and the harlot's house of shame. Lo! man with monuments and lifted shields Against his city's fate. A flame! his city yields. WHERE ROLLS THE OREGON See once these stately scenes, then roam no more; No more remains on earth to eager eyes; The cataract comes down, a broken roar, The palisades defy approach, and rise Green moss'd and dripping to the clouded skies. The cañon thunders with its full of foam, And calls loud-mouth'd, and all the land defies; The mounts make fellowship and dwell at home In snowy brotherhood beneath their purpled dome. The rainbows swim in circles round, and rise Against the hanging granite walls till lost In drifting dreamy clouds and dappled skies, A grand mosaic intertwined and toss'd Along the mighty cañon, bound and cross'd By storms of screaming birds of sea and land; The salmon rush below, bright red and boss'd In silver. Tawny, tall, on either hand You see the savage spearman nude and silent stand. Here sweep the wide wild waters cold and white And blue in their far depths; divided now By sudden swift canoe as still and light As feathers nodding from the painted brow That lifts and looks from out the imaged prow. Ashore you hear the papoose shout at play; The curl'd smoke comes from underneath the bough Of leaning fir: the wife looks far away And sees a swift slim bark divide the dashing spray. Slow drift adown the river's level'd deep, And look above; lo, columns! woods! the snow! The rivers rush upon the brink and leap From out the clouds three thousand feet below, And land afoam in tops of firs that grow Against your river's rim: they plash, they play In clouds, now loud and now subdued and slow, A thousand thunder tones; they swing and sway In idle winds, long leaning shafts of shining spray. An Indian summer-time it was, long past, We lay on this Columbia, far below The stormy water falls, and God had cast Us heaven's stillness. Dreamily and slow We drifted as the light bark chose to go. An Indian girl with ornaments of shell Began to sing. ... The stars may hold such flow Of hair, such eyes, but rarely earth. There fell A sweet enchantment that possess'd me as a spell. We saw an elk forsake the sable wood, Step quick across the rim of shining sand, Breast out unscared against the flashing flood, Then brisket deep with lifted antlers stand, And ears alert, look sharp on either hand, Then whistle shrill to dam and doubting fawn To cross, then lead with black nose from the land. They cross'd, they climb'd the heaving hills, were gone, A sturdy charging line with crooked sabers drawn. Then black swans cross'd us slowly low and still; Then other swans, wide-wing'd and white as snow, Flew overhead and topp'd the timber'd hill, And call'd and sang afar, coarse-voiced and slow, Till sounds roam'd lost in somber firs below ... Then clouds blew in, and all the sky was cast With tumbled and tumultuous clouds that grow Red thunderbolts ... A flash! A thunderblast! The clouds were rent, and lo! Mount Hood hung white and vast. PICTURE OF A BULL Once, morn by morn, when snowy mountains flamed With sudden shafts of light that shot a flood Into the vale like fiery arrows aim'd At night from mighty battlements, there stood Upon a cliff high-limn'd against Mount Hood, A matchless bull, fresh forth from sable wold, And standing so seem'd grander 'gainst the wood Than winged bull that stood with tips of gold Beside the brazen gates of Nineveh of old. A time he toss'd the dewy turf, and then Stretch'd forth his wrinkled neck, and loud He call'd above the far abodes of men Until his breath became a curling cloud And wreathed about his neck a misty shroud. He then as sudden as he came pass'd on With lifted head, majestic and most proud, And lone as night in deepest wood withdrawn He roamed in silent rage until another dawn. What drove the hermit from the valley herd, What cross of love, what cold neglect of kind, Or scorn of unpretending worth had stirr'd The stubborn blood and drove him forth to find A fellowship in mountain cloud and wind, I ofttime wonder'd much; and ofttime thought The beast betray'd a royal monarch's mind, To lift above the low herd's common lot, And make them hear him still when they had fain forgot. VAQUERO His broad-brimm'd hat push'd back with careless air, The proud vaquero sits his steed as free As winds that toss his black abundant hair. No rover ever swept a lawless sea With such a haught and heedless air as he Who scorns the path, and bounds with swift disdain Away, a peon born, yet born to be A splendid king; behold him ride, and reign. How brave he takes his herds in branding days, On timber'd hills that belt about the plain; He climbs, he wheels, he shouts through winding ways Of hiding ferns and hanging fir; the rein Is loose, the rattling spur drives swift; the mane Blows free; the bullocks rush in storms before; They turn with lifted heads, they rush again, Then sudden plunge from out the wood, and pour A cloud upon the plain with one terrific roar. Now sweeps the tawny man on stormy steed, His gaudy trappings toss'd about and blown About the limbs as lithe as any reed; The swift long lasso twirl'd above is thrown From flying hand; the fall, the fearful groan Of bullock toil'd and tumbled in the dust— The black herds onward sweep, and all disown The fallen, struggling monarch that has thrust His tongue in rage and roll'd his red eyes in disgust. A morn in Oregon! The kindled camp Upon the mountain brow that broke below In steep and grassy stairway to the damp And dewy valley, snapp'd and flamed aglow With knots of pine. Above, the peaks of snow, With under-belts of sable forests, rose And flash'd in sudden sunlight. To and fro And far below, in lines and winding rows, The herders drove their bands, and broke the deep repose. I heard their shouts like sounding hunter's horn, The lowing herds made echoes far away; When lo! the clouds came driving in with morn And broke like breakers of a stormy bay Against the grassy shingle fold on fold, So like some splendid ocean, snowy white and Toward the sea, as fleeing from the day. The valleys fill'd with curly clouds. They lay Below, a levell'd sea that reach'd and roll'd cold. The peopled valley lay a hidden world, The shouts were shouts of drowning men that died, The broken clouds along the border curl'd, And bent the grass with weighty freight of tide. A savage stood in silence at my side, Then sudden threw aback his beaded strouds And stretch'd his hand above the scene, and cried, As all the land lay dead in snowy shrouds: “Behold! the sun bathes in a silver sea of clouds.” Here lifts the land of clouds! Fierce mountain forms, Made white with everlasting snows, look down Through mists of many cañons, mighty storms That stretch from Autumn's purple, drench and drown The yellow hem of Spring. Tall cedars frown Dark-brow'd, through banner'd clouds that stretch and stream Above the sea from snowy mountain crown. The heavens roll, and all things drift or seem To drift about and drive like some majestic dream. In waning Autumn time, when purpled skies Begin to haze in indolence below The snowy peaks, you see black forms arise, In rolling thunder banks above, and throw Quick barricades about the gleaming snow. The strife begins! The battling seasons stand Broad breast to breast. A flash! Contentions grow Terrific. Thunders crash, and lightnings brand The battlements. The clouds possess the conquered land. Then clouds blow by, the swans take loftier flight, The yellow blooms burst out upon the hill, The purple camas comes as in a night, Tall spiked and dripping of the dews that fill The misty valley. Sunbeams break and spill Their glory till the vale is full of noon. Then roses belt the streams, no bird is still. The stars, as large as lilies, meet the moon And sing of summer, born thus sudden full and soon. TO REST AT LAST These final verses are peculiarly descriptive of the home I have built here on the Hights for my declining years; although written and published in London—Songs of the Sunlands—in 1873. True, my strong love of a home of my own, woods, and “a careless ordered garden” led me to settle down in other lands more than once and in places widely different from this which I had fancied and pictured long, long ago, but I was never well or at all content in any place till now. Even the people about me, unworldly, dreamful, silent and of other lands and tongues are, like my home, the same I had pictured more than a quarter of a century ago, and I joy in this, that I have been thus true to myself. The only departure from my dear first plan is in finding my ideal home by the glorious gate of San Francisco instead of the somber fir-set sea bank far to the north, “Where Rolls the Oregon.” What wonder that I swore a prophet's oath Of after days. ... I push'd the boughs apart, I stood, look'd forth, and then look'd back, all loath To leave my shadow'd wood. I gather'd heart From very fearfulness; with sudden start I plunged in the arena; stood a wild Uncertain thing, all artless, in all art. ... The brave approved, the fair lean'd fair and smiled,— True lions touch with velvet-touch a timid child. But now enough of men. Enough, brief day Of tinsel'd life. The court, the castle gate That open'd wide along the pleasant way, The gracious converse of the kingly great Had made another glad and well elate With all. A world of thanks; but I am grown Aweary. ... I am not of this estate; The poor, the plain brave border-men alone Were my first love, and these I will not now disown. I know a grassy slope above the sea, The utmost limit of the westmost land. In savage, gnarl'd, and antique majesty The great trees belt about the place, and stand In guard, with mailéd limb and lifted hand, Against the cold approaching civic pride. The foamy brooklets seaward leap; the bland Still air is fresh with touch of wood and tide, And peace, eternal peace, possesses, wild and wide. Here I return, here I abide and rest; Some flocks and herds shall feed along the stream; Some corn and climbing vines shall make us blest With bread and luscious fruit. ... The sunny dream Of wampum men in moccasins that seem To come and go in silence, girt in shell, Before a sun-clad cabin-door, I deem The harbinger of peace. Hope weaves her spell Again about the wearied heart, and all is well. Here I shall sit in sunlit life's decline Beneath my vine and somber verdant tree. Some tawny maids in other tongues than mine Shall minister. Some memories shall be Before me. I shall sit and I shall see, That last vast day that dawn shall reinspire, The sun fall down upon the farther sea, Fall wearied down to rest, and so retire, A splendid sinking isle of far-off fading fire. DAWN AT SAN DIEGO My city sits amid her palms; The perfume of her twilight breath Is something as the sacred balms That bound sweet Jesus after death, Such soft, warm twilight sense as lies Against the gates of Paradise. Such prayerful palms, wide palms upreached! This sea mist is as incense smoke, Yon mission walls a sermon preached— White lily with a heart of oak. And O, this twilight! O the grace Of twilight on yon lifted face! I love you, twilight,—love with love So loyal, loving, fond that I When folding these worn hands to die, Shall pray God lead me not above, But leave me, twilight, sad and true, To walk this lonesome world with you. Yea, God knows I have walked with night; I have not seen, I have not known Such light as beats upon His throne. I know I could not bear such light; Therefore, I beg, sad sister true, To share your shadow-world with you. I love you, love you, maid of night, Your perfumed breath, your dreamful eyes, Your holy silences, your sighs Of mateless longing; your delight When might says, Hang on yon moon's horn Your russet gown, and rest till morn. The sun is dying; space and room, Serenity, vast sense of rest, Lie bosomed in the orange west Of orient waters. Hear the boom Of long, strong billows; wave on wave, Like funeral guns above a grave. Now night folds all; no sign or word; But still that rocking of the deep— Sweet mother, rock the world to sleep: Still rock and rock; as I have heard Sweet mother gently rock and rock The while she folds the little frock. Broad, mesa, brown, bare mountains, brown, Bowed sky of brown, that erst was blue; Dark, earth-brown curtains coming down— Earth-brown, that all hues melt into; Brown twilight, born of light and shade; Of night that came, of light that passed. ... How like some lorn, majestic maid That wares not whither way at last! Now perfumed Night, sad-faced and far, Walks up the world in somber brown. Now suddenly a loosened star Lets all her golden hair fall down— And Night is dead Day's coffin-lid, With stars of gold shot through his pall. ... I hear the chorus, katydid; A katydid, and that is all. Some star-tipt candles foot and head; Some perfumes of the perfumed sea; And now above the coffined dead Dusk draws great curtains lovingly; While far o'er all, so dreamful far, God's Southern Cross by faith is seen Tipt by one single blazing star, With spaces infinite between. Come, love His twilight, the perfume Of God's great trailing garment's hem; The sense of rest, the sense of room, The garnered goodness of the day, The twelve plucked hours of His tree, When all the world has gone its way And left perfection quite to me And Him who, loving, fashioned them. I know not why that wealth and pride Win not my heart or woo my tale. I only know I know them not; I only know to cast my lot Where love walks noiselessly with night And patient nature; my delight The wild rose of the mountain side, The lowly lily of the vale; To live not asking, just to live; To live not begging, just to be; To breathe God's presence in the dusk That drives out loud, assertive light— To never ask, but ever give; To love my noiseless mother, Night; Her vast hair moist with smell of musk, Her breath sweet with eternity. I A hermit's path, a mountain's perch, A sandaled monk, a dying man— A far-off, low, adobe church, Below the hermit's orange-trees That cap the clouds above the seas, So far, its spire seems but a span. A low-voiced dove! The dying Don Put back the cross and sat dark-browed And sullen, as a dove flew out The bough, and circling round about, Was bathed and gathered in a cloud, That, like some ship, sailed on and on. But let the gray monk tell the tale; And tell it just as told to me. This Don was chiefest of the vale That banks by San Diego's sea, And who so just, so generous, As he who now lay dying thus? But wrong, such shameless Saxon wrong, Had crushed his heart, had made him hate The sight, the very sound of man. He loved the lonely wood-dove's song; He loved it as his living mate. And lo! the good monk laid a ban And penance of continual prayer— But list, the living, dying there! For now the end was, and he lay As day lies banked against the night— As lies some bark at close of day To wait the dew-born breath of night; To wait the ebb of tide, to wait The swift plunge through the Golden Gate: The plunge from bay to boundless sea— From life through narrow straits of night, From time to bright eternity— To everlasting walks of light. Some like as when you sudden blow Your candle out and turn you so To sleep unto the open day: And thus the priest did pleading say: “You fled my flock, and sought this steep And stony, star-lit, lonely height, Where weird and unnamed creatures keep To hold strange thought with things of night Long, long ago. But now at last Your life sinks surely to the past. Lay hold, lay hold, the cross I bring, Where all God's goodly creatures cling. “Yea! You are good. Dark-browed and low Beneath your shaggy brows you look On me, as you would read a book: And darker still your dark brows grow As I lift up the cross to pray, And plead with you to walk its way. “Yea, you are good! There is not one, From Tia Juana to the reach And bound of gray Pacific Beach, From Coronado's palm-set isle And palm-hung pathways, mile on mile, But speaks you, Señor, good and true. But oh, my silent, dying son! The cross alone can speak for you When all is said and all is done. “Come! Turn your dim, dark eyes to me, Have faith and help me plant this cross Beyond where blackest billows toss, As you would plant some pleasant tree: Some fruitful orange-tree, and know That it shall surely grow and grow, As your own orange-trees have grown, And be, as they, your very own. “You smile at last, and pleasantly: You love your laden orange-trees Set high above your silver seas With your own honest hand; each tree A date, a day, a part, indeed, Of your own life, and walk, and creed. ”You love your steeps, your star-set blue: You watch yon billows flash, and toss, And leap, and curve, in merry rout, You love to hear them laugh and shout— Men say you hear them talk to you; Men say you sit and look and look, As one who reads some holy book— My son, come, look upon the cross? “Come, see me plant amid your trees My cross, that you may see and know 'T will surely grow, and grow, and grow, As grows some trusted little seed; As grows some secret, small good deed; The while you gaze upon your seas. ... Sweet Christ, now let it grow, and bear Fair fruit, as your own fruit is fair. “Aye! ever from the first I knew, And marked its flavor, freshness, hue, The gold of sunset and the gold Of morn, in each rich orange rolled. “I mind me now, 't was long since, friend, When first I climbed your path alone, A savage path of brush and stone, And rattling serpents without end. “Yea, years ago, when blood and life Ran swift, and your sweet, faithful wife— What! tears at last; hot, piteous tears That through your bony fingers creep The while you bend your face, and weep As if your heart of hearts would break— As if these tears were your heart's blood, A pent-up, sudden, bursting flood— Look on the cross, for Jesus' sake.” II 'T was night, and still it seemed not night. Yet, far down in the cañon deep, Where night had housed all day, to keep Companion with the wolf, you might Have hewn a statue out of night. The shrill coyote loosed his tongue Deep in the dark arroyo's bed; And bat and owl above his head From out their gloomy caverns swung: A swoop of wings, a cat-like call, A crackle sharp of chaparral! Then sudden, fitful winds sprang out, And swept the mesa like a broom; Wild, saucy winds, that sang of room! That leapt the cañon with a shout From dusty throats, audaciously And headlong tore into the sea, As tore the swine with lifted snout. Some birds came, went, then came again From out the hermit's wood-hung hill; Came swift, and arrow-like, and still, As you have seen birds, when the rain— The great, big, high-born rain, leapt white And sudden from a cloud like night. And then a dove, dear, nun-like dove, With eyes all tenderness, with eyes So loving, longing; full of love, That when she reached her slender throat And sang one low, soft, sweetest note, Just one, so faint, so far, so near, You could have wept with joy to hear. The old man, as if he had slept, Raised quick his head, then bowed and wept For joy, to hear once more her voice. With childish joy he did rejoice; As one will joy to surely learn His dear, dead love is living still; As one will joy to know, in turn, He, too, is loved with love to kill. He put a hand forth, let it fall And feebly close; and that was all. And then he turned his tearful eyes To meet the priest's, and spake this wise:— Now mind, I say, not one more word That livelong night of nights was heard By monk or man, from dusk till dawn; And yet that man spake on and on. Why, know you not, soul speaks to soul? I say the use of words shall pass. Words are but fragments of the glass; But silence is the perfect whole. And thus the old man, bowed and wan, And broken in his body, spake— Spake youthful, ardent, on and on, As dear love speaks for dear love's sake. “You spake of her, my wife; behold! Behold my faithful, constant love! Nay, nay, you shall not doubt my dove, Perched there above your cross of gold!— “Yea, you have books, I know, to tell Of far, fair heaven; but no hell To her had been so terrible As all sweet heaven, with its gold And jasper gates, and great white throne, Had she been banished hence alone. “I say, not God himself could keep, Beyond the stars, beneath the deep, Or 'mid the stars, or 'mid the sea, Her soul from my soul one brief day, But she would find some pretty way To come and still companion me. “And say, where bide your souls, good priest Lies heaven west, lies heaven east? Let us be frank, let us be fair; Where is your heaven, good priest, where? “Is there not room, is there not place In all those boundless realms of space? Is there not room in this sweet air, Room 'mid my trees, room anywhere, For souls that love us thus so well, And love so well this beauteous world, But that they must be headlong hurled Down, down, to undiscovered hell? “Good priest, we questioned not one word Of all the holy things we heard Down in your pleasant town of palms Long, long ago—sweet chants, sweet psalms, Sweet incense, and the solemn rite Above the dear, believing dead. Nor do I question here tonight One gentle word you may have said. I would not doubt, for one brief hour, Your word, your creed, your priestly power, Your purity, unselfish zeal, But there be fears I scorn to feel! Let those who will, seek realms above, Remote from all that heart can love, In their ignoble dread of hell. Give all, good priest, in charity; Give heaven to all, if this may be, And count it well, and very well. “But I—I could not leave this spot Where she is waiting by my side. Forgive me, priest; it is not pride; There is no God where she is not! “You did not know her well. Her creed Was yours; my faith it was the same. My faith was fair, my lands were broad. Far down where yonder palm-trees rise We two together worshiped God From childhood. And we grew in deed, Devout in heart as well as name, And loved our palm-set paradise. “We loved, we loved all things on earth, However mean or miserable. We knew no thing had not worth, And learned to know no need of hell. “Indeed, good priest, so much, indeed, We found to do, we saw to love, We did not always look above As is commanded in your creed, But kept in heart one chiefest care, To make this fair world still more fair. “'T was then that meek, pale Saxon came With soulless gray and greedy eyes, A snake's eyes, cunning, cold and wise, And I—I could not fight, or fly His crafty wiles at all; and I— Enough, enough! I signed my name. “It was not loss of pleasure, place, Broad lands, or the serene delight Of doing good, that made long night O'er all the sunlight of her face. But there be little things that feed A woman's sweetness, day by day, That strong men miss not, do not need, But, shorn of all can go their way To battle, and but stronger grow, As grow great waves that gather so. “She missed the music, missed the song, The pleasant speech of courteous men, Who came and went, a comely throng, Before her open window, when The sea sang with us, and we two Had heartfelt homage, warm and true. “She missed the restfulness, the rest Of dulcet silence, the delight Of singing silence, when the town Put on its twilight robes of brown; When twilight wrapped herself in night And couched against the curtained west. “But not one murmur, not one word From her sweet baby lips was heard. She only knew I could not bear To see sweet San Diego town, Her palm-set lanes, her pleasant square, Her people passing up and down, Without black hate, and deadly hate For him who housed within our gate, And so, she gently led my feet Aside to this high, wild retreat. “How pale she grew, how piteous pale The while I wrought, and ceaseless wrought To keep my soul from bitter thought, And build me here above the vale. Ah me! my selfish, Spanish pride! Enough of pride, enough of hate, Enough of her sad, piteous fate: She died: right here she sank and died. “She died, and with her latest breath Did promise to return to me, As turns a dove unto her tree To find her mate at night and rest; Died, clinging close against my breast; Died, saying she would surely rise So soon as God had loosed her eyes From the strange wonderment of death. “How beautiful is death! and how Surpassing good, and true, and fair! How just is death, how gently just, To lay his sword against the thread Of life when life is surely dead And loose the sweet soul from the dust! I laid her in my lorn despair Beneath that dove, that orange-bough— How strange your cross should stand just there! “And then I waited hours, days: Those bitter days, they were as years. My soul groped through the darkest ways; I scarce could see God's face for tears. “I clutched my knife, and I crept down, A wolf, to San Diego town. On, on, amid my palms once more, Keen knife in hand, I crept that night. I passed the gate, then fled in fright; Black crape hung fluttered from the door! “I climbed back here, with heart of stone: I heard next morn one sweetest tone; Looked up, and lo! there on that bough She perched, as she sits perching now. “I heard the bells peal from my height, Peal pompously, peal piously; Saw sable hearse, in plumes of night With not one thought of hate in me. “I watched the long train winding by, A mournful, melancholy lie— A sable, solemn, mourning mile— And only pitied him the while. For she, she sang that whole day through: Sad-voiced, as if she pitied, too. “They said, ‘His work is done, and well.’ They laid his body in a tomb Of massive splendor. It lies there In all its stolen pomp and gloom— But list! his soul—his soul is where? In hell! In hell! But where is hell? “Hear me but this. Year after year She trained my eye, she trained my ear; No book to blind my eyes, or ought To prate of hell, when hell is not. I came to know at last, and well, Such things as never book can tell. “And where was that poor, dismal soul Ye priests had sent to paradise? I heard the long years roll and roll, As rolls the sea. My once dimmed eyes Grew keen as long, sharp shafts of light. With eager eyes and reaching face I searched the stars night after night: That dismal soul was not in space! “Meanwhile my green trees grew and grew; And sad or glad, this much I knew, It were no sin to make more fair One spot on earth, to toil and share With man, or beast, or bird; while she Still sang her soft, sweet melody. “One day, a perfumed day in white— Such restful, fresh, and friendlike day,— Fair Mexico a mirage lay Far-lifted in a sea of light— Soft, purple light, so far away. I turned yon pleasant pathway down, And sauntered leisurely tow'rd town. “I heard my dear love call and coo, And knew that she was happy, too, In her sad, sweet, and patient pain Of waiting till I came again. “Aye, I was glad, quite glad at last; Not glad as I had been when she Walked with me by yon palm-set sea, But sadly and serenely glad: As though 't were twilight like, as though You knew, and yet you did not know, That sadness, most supremely sad Should lay upon you like a pall, And would not, could not pass away Till you should pass; till perfect day Dawns sudden on you, and the call Of birds awakens you to morn— A babe new-born; a soul new-born. “Good priest, what are the birds for? Priest Build ye your heaven west or east? Above, below, or anywhere? I only ask, I only say She sits there, waiting for the day, The fair, full day to guide me there. “What, he? That creature? Ah, quite true I wander much, I weary you: I beg your pardon, gentle priest. Returning up the stone-strewn steep, Down in yon jungle, dank and deep, Where toads and venomed reptiles creep, There, there, I saw that hideous beast! “Aye, there! coiled there beside my road, Close coiled behind a monstrous toad, A huge flat-bellied reptile hid! His tongue leapt red as flame; his eyes, His eyes were burning hells of lies— His head was like a coffin's lid: “Saint George! Saint George! I gasped for breath. The beast, tight coiled, swift, sudden sprang High in the air, and, rattling, sang His hateful, hissing song of death! “My eyes met his. He shrank, he fell, Fell sullenly and slow. The swell Of braided, brassy neck forgot Its poise, and every venomed spot Lost luster, and the coffin head Cowed level with the toad, and lay Low, quivering with hate and dread: The while I kept my upward way. “What! Should have killed him? Nay, good priest. I know not what or where 's your hell. But be it west or be it east, His hell is there! and that is well! “Nay, do not, do not question me; I could not tell you why I know; I only know that this is so, As sure as God is equity. “Good priest, forgive me, and good-by, The stars slow gather to their fold; I see God's garment hem of gold Against the far, faint morning sky. “Good, holy priest, your God is where? You come to me with book and creed; I cannot read your book; I read Yon boundless, open book of air. What time, or way, or place I look, I see God in His garden walk; I hear Him through the thunders talk, As once He talked, with burning tongue, To Moses, when the world was young; And, priest, what more is in your book? “Behold! the Holy Grail is found, Found in each poppy's cup of gold; And God walks with us as of old. Behold! the burning bush still burns For man, whichever way he turns; And all God's earth is holy ground. “And—and—good priest, bend low your head The sands are crumbling where I tread, Beside the shoreless, soundless sea. Good priest, you came to pray, you said; And now, what would you have of me?” The good priest gently raised his head, Then bowed it low and softly said: “Your blessing, son, despite the ban.” He fell before the dying man; And when he raised his face from prayer, Sweet Dawn, and two sweet doves were there.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Volume Three Songs of the Sunlands THE SEA OF FIRE In a land so far that you wonder whether If God would know it should you fall down dead; In a land so far through the soft, warm weather That the sun sinks red as a warrior sped,— Where the sea and the sky seem closing together, Seem closing together as a book that is read: 'Tis the half-finished world! You footfall retreating,— It might be the Maker disturbed at his task. But the footfall of God, or the far pheasant beating, It is one and the same, whatever the mask It may wear unto man. The woods keep repeating The old sacred sermons, whatever you ask. It is man in his garden, scarce wakened as yet From the sleep that fell on him when woman was made. The new-finished garden is plastic and wet From the hand that has fashioned its unpeopled shade; And the wonder still looks from the fair woman's eyes As she shines through the wood like the light from the skies. And a ship now and then for this far Ophir shore Draws in from the sea. It lies close to the bank; Then a dull, muffled sound on the slow shuffled plank As they load the black ship; but you hear nothing more, And the dark, dewy vines, and the tall, somber wood Like twilight droop over the deep, sweeping flood. The black masts are tangled with branches that cross, The rich fragrant gums fall from branches to deck, The thin ropes are swinging with streamers of moss That mantle all things like the shreds of a wreck; The long mosses swing, there is never a breath: The river rolls still as the river of death. I In the beginning,—ay, before The six-day's labors were well o'er; Yea, while the world lay incomplete, Ere God had opened quite the door Of this strange land for strong men's feet,— There lay against that westmost sea, A weird, wild land of mystery. A far white wall, like fallen moon, Girt out the world. The forest lay So deep you scarcely saw the day, Save in the high-held middle noon: It lay a land of sleep and dreams, And clouds drew through like shoreless streams That stretch to where no man may say. Men reached it only from the sea, By black-built ships, that seemed to creep Along the shore suspiciously, Like unnamed monsters of the deep. It was the weirdest land, I ween, That mortal eye has ever seen. A dim, dark land of bird and beast, Black shaggy beasts with cloven claw,— A land that scarce knew prayer or priest, Or law of man, or Nature's law; Where no fixed line drew sharp dispute 'Twixt savage man and sullen brute. II It hath a history most fit For cunning hand to fashion on; No chronicler hath mentioned it; No buccaneer set foot upon. 'Tis of an outlawed Spanish Don,— A cruel man, with pirate's gold That loaded down his deep ship's hold. A deep ship's hold of plundered gold! The golden cruse, the golden cross, From many a church of Mexico, From Panama's mad overthrow, From many a ransomed city's loss, From many a follower fierce and bold, And many a foeman stark and cold. He found this wild, lost land. He drew His ship to shore. His ruthless crew, Like Romulus, laid lawless hand On meek brown maidens of the land, And in their bloody forays bore Red firebrands along the shore. III The red men rose at night. They came, A firm, unflinching wall of flame; They swept, as sweeps some fateful sea O'er land of sand and level shore That howls in far, fierce agony. The red men swept that deep, dark shore As threshers sweep a threshing floor. And yet beside the slain Don's door They left his daughter, as they fled: They spared her life because she bore Their Chieftain's blood and name. The red And blood-stained hidden hoards of gold They hollowed from the stout ship's hold, And bore in many a slim canoe— To where? The good priest only knew. IV The course of life is like the sea; Men come and go; tides rise and fall; And that is all of history. The tide flows in, flows out today— And that is all that man may say; Man is, man was,—and that is all. Revenge at last came like a tide,— 'Twas sweeping, deep and terrible; The Christian found the land, and came To take possession in Christ's name. For every white man that had died I think a thousand red men fell,— A Christian custom; and the land Lay lifeless as some burned-out brand. V Ere while the slain Don's daughter grew A glorious thing, a flower of spring, A something more than mortals knew; A mystery of grace and face,— A silent mystery that stood An empress in that sea-set wood, Supreme, imperial in her place. It might have been men's lust for gold,— For all men knew that lawless crew Left hoards of gold in that ship's hold, That drew ships hence, and silent drew Strange Jasons there to love or dare; I never knew, nor need I care. I say it might have been this gold That ever drew and strangely drew Strong men of land, strange men of sea To seek this shore of mystery With all its wondrous tales untold; The gold or her, which of the two? It matters not to me, nor you. But this I know, that as for me, Between that face and the hard fate That kept me ever from my own, As some wronged monarch from his throne, All heaped-up gold of land or sea Had never weighed one feather's weight. Her home was on the wooded height,— A woody home, a priest at prayer, A perfume in the fervid air, And angels watching her at night. I can but think upon the skies That bound that other Paradise. VI Below a star-built arch, as grand As ever bended heaven spanned, Tall trees like mighty columns grew— They loomed as if to pierce the blue, They reached, as reaching heaven through. The shadowed stream rolled far below, Where men moved noiseless to and fro As in some vast cathedral, when The calm of prayer comes to men, And benedictions bless them so. What wooded sea-banks, wild and steep! What trackless wood! what snowy cone That lifted from this wood alone! What wild, wide river, dark and deep! What ships against the shore asleep! VII An Indian woman cautious crept About the land the while it slept, The relic of her perished race. She wore rich, rudely-fashioned bands Of gold above her bony hands; She hissed hot curses on the place! VIII Go seek the red man's last retreat! What lonesome lands! what haunted lands! Red mouths of beasts, red men's red hands; Red prophet-priests, in mute defeat. From Incan temples overthrown To lorn Alaska's isles of bone The red man lives and dies alone. His boundaries in blood are writ! His land is ghostland! That is his, Whatever we may claim of this; Beware how you shall enter it! He stands God's guardian of ghostlands; Yea, this same wrapped half-prophet stands All nude and voiceless, nearer to The dread, lone God than I or you. IX This bronzed child, by that river's brink, Stood fair to see as you can think, As tall as tall reeds at her feet, As fresh as flowers in her hair; As sweet as flowers over-sweet, As fair as vision more than fair! How beautiful she was! How wild! How pure as water-plant, this child,— This one wild child of Nature here Grown tall in shadows. And how near To God, where no man stood between Her eyes and scenes no man hath seen,— This maiden that so mutely stood, The one lone woman of that wood. Stop still, my friend, and do not stir, Shut close your page and think of her. The birds sang sweeter for her face; Her lifted eyes were like a grace To seamen of that solitude, However rough, however rude. The rippled river of her hair, Flowed in such wondrous waves, somehow Flowed down divided by her brow,— It mantled her within its care, And flooded all her form below, In its uncommon fold and flow. A perfume and an incense lay Before her, as an incense sweet Before blithe mowers of sweet May In early morn. Her certain feet Embarked on no uncertain way. Come, think how perfect before men, How sweet as sweet magnolia bloom Embalmed in dews of morning, when Rich sunlight leaps from midnight gloom Resolved to kiss, and swift to kiss Ere yet morn wakens man to bliss. X The days swept on. Her perfect year Was with her now. The sweet perfume Of womanhood in holy bloom, As when red harvest blooms appear, Possessed her soul. The priest did pray That saints alone should pass that way. A red bird built beneath her roof, Brown squirrels crossed her cabin sill, And welcome came or went at will. A hermit spider wove his web Above her door and plied his trade, With none to fright or make afraid. The silly elk, the spotted fawn, And all dumb beasts that came to drink, That stealthy stole upon the brink By coming night or going dawn, On seeing her familiar face Would fearless stop and stand in place. She was so kind, the beasts of night Gave her the road as if her right; The panther crouching overhead In sheen of moss would hear her tread, And bend his eyes, but never stir Lest he by chance might frighten her. Yet in her splendid strength, her eyes, There lay the lightning of the skies; The love-hate of the lioness, To kill the instant or caress: A pent-up soul that sometimes grew Impatient; why, she hardly knew. At last she sighed, uprose, and threw Her strong arms out as if to hand Her love, sun-born and all complete At birth, to some brave lover's feet On some far, fair, and unseen land, As knowing not quite what to do! XI How beautiful she was! Why, she Was inspiration! She was born To walk God's sunlit hills at morn, Nor waste her by this wood-dark sea. What wonder, then, her soul's white wings Beat at its bars, like living things! Once more she sighed! She wandered through The sea-bound wood, then stopped and drew Her hand above her face, and swept The lonesome sea, and all day kept Her face to sea, as if she knew Some day, some near or distant day, Her destiny should come that way. XII How proud she was! How darkly fair! How full of faith, of love, of strength! Her calm, proud eyes! Her great hair's length,— Her long, strong, tumbled, careless hair, Half curled and knotted anywhere,— By brow or breast, or cheek or chin, For love to trip and tangle in! XIII At last a tall strange sail was seen: It came so slow, so wearily, Came creeping cautious up the sea, As if it crept from out between The half-closed sea and sky that lay Tight wedged together, far away. She watched it, wooed it. She did pray It might not pass her by but bring Some love, some hate, some anything, To break the awful loneliness That like a nightly nightmare lay Upon her proud and pent-up soul Until it barely brooked control. XIV The ship crept silent up the sea, And came— You cannot understand How fair she was, how sudden she Had sprung, full grown, to womanhood. How gracious, yet how proud and grand; How glorified, yet fresh and free, How human, yet how more than good. XV The ship stole slowly, slowly on;— Should you in Californian field In ample flower-time behold The soft south rose lift like a shield Against the sudden sun at dawn, A double handful of heaped gold, Why you, perhaps, might understand How splendid and how queenly she Uprose beside that wood-set sea. The storm-worn ship scarce seemed to creep From wave to wave. It scarce could keep— How still this fair girl stood, how fair! How tall her presence as she stood Between that vast sea and west wood! How large and liberal her soul, How confident, how purely chare, How trusting; how untried the whole Great heart, grand faith, that blossomed there. XVI Ay, she was as Madonna to The tawny, lawless, faithful few Who touched her hand and knew her soul: She drew them, drew them as the pole Points all things to itself. She drew Men upward as a moon of spring High wheeling, vast and bosom-full, Half clad in clouds and white as wool, Draws all the strong seas following. Yet still she moved as sad, as lone As that same moon that leans above, And seems to search high heaven through For some strong, all sufficient love, For one brave love to be her own, Be all her own and ever true. Oh, I once knew a sad, sweet dove That died for such sufficient love, Such high, white love with wings to soar, That looks love level in the face, Nor wearies love with leaning o'er To lift love level to her place. XVII How slow before the sleeping breeze, That stranger ship from under seas! How like to Dido by her sea, When reaching arms imploringly,— Her large, round, rich, impassioned arms, Tossed forth from all her storied charms— This one lone maiden leaning stood Above that sea, beneath that wood! The ship crept strangely up the seas; Her shrouds seemed shreds, her masts seemed trees,— Strange tattered trees of toughest bough That knew no cease of storm till now. The maiden pitied her; she prayed Her crew might come, nor feel afraid; She prayed the winds might come,—they came, As birds that answer to a name. The maiden held her blowing hair That bound her beauteous self about; The sea-winds housed within her hair; She let it go, it blew in rout About her bosom full and bare. Her round, full arms were free as air, Her high hands clasped as clasped in prayer. XVIII The breeze grew bold, the battered ship Began to flap her weary wings; The tall, torn masts began to dip And walk the wave like living things. She rounded in, moved up the stream, She moved like some majestic dream. The captain kept her deck. He stood A Hercules among his men; And now he watched the sea, and then He peered as if to pierce the wood. He now looked back, as if pursued, Now swept the sea with glass as though He fled, or feared some prowling foe. Slow sailing up the river's mouth, Slow tacking north, slow tacking south, He touched the overhanging wood; He kept his deck, his tall black mast Touched tree-top mosses as he passed; He touched the steep shore where she stood. XIX Her hands still clasped as if in prayer, Sweet prayer set to silentness; Her sun-browned throat uplifted, bare And beautiful. Her eager face Illumed with love and tenderness, And all her presence gave such grace, That she seemed more than mortal, fair. XX He saw. He could not speak. No more With lifted glass he swept the sea; No more he watched the wild new shore. Now foes might come, now friends might flee; He could not speak, he would not stir,— He saw but her, he feared but her. The black ship ground against the shore, With creak and groan and rusty clank, And tore the mellow blossomed bank; She ground against the bank as one With long and weary journeys done, That will not rise to journey more. Yet still tall Jason silent stood And gazed against that sea-washed wood, As one whose soul is anywhere. All seemed so fair, so wondrous fair! At last aroused, he stepped to land Like some Columbus; then laid hand On lands and fruits, and rested there. XXI He found all fairer than fair morn In sylvan land, where waters run With downward leap against the sun, And full-grown sudden May is born. He found her taller than tall corn Tiptoe in tassel; found her sweet As vale where bees of Hybla meet. An unblown rose, an unread book; A wonder in her wondrous eyes; A large, religious, steadfast look Of faith, of trust,—the look of one New fashioned in fair Paradise. He read this book—read on and on From title page to colophon: As in cool woods, some summer day, You find delight in some sweet lay, And so entranced read on and on From title page to colophon. XXII And who was he that rested there,— This giant of a grander day, This Theseus of a nobler Greece, This Jason of the golden fleece? Aye, who was he? And who were they That came to seek the hidden gold Long hollowed from the pirate's hold? I do not know. You need not care. They loved, this maiden and this man, And that is all I surely know,— The rest is as the winds that blow, He bowed as brave men bow to fate, Yet proud and resolute and bold; She shy at first, and coyly cold, Held back and tried to hesitate,— Half frightened at this love that ran Hard gallop till her hot heart beat Like sounding of swift courser's feet. XXIII Two strong streams of a land must run Together surely as the sun Succeeds the moon. Who shall gainsay The gods that reign, that wisely reign? Love is, love was, shall be again. Like death, inevitable it is; Perchance, like death, the dawn of bliss. Let us, then, love the perfect day, The twelve o'clock of life, and stop The two hands pointing to the top, And hold them tightly while we may. XXIV How beautiful is love! The walks By wooded ways; the silent talks Beneath the broad and fragrant bough. The dark deep wood, the dense black dell, Where scarce a single gold beam fell From out the sun. They rested now On mossy trunk. They wandered then Where never fell the feet of men. Then longer walks, then deeper woods, Then sweeter talks, sufficient sweet, In denser, deeper solitudes,— Dear careless ways for careless feet; Sweet talks of paradise for two, And only two to watch or woo. She rarely spake. All seemed a dream She would not waken from. She lay All night but waiting for the day, When she might see his face, and deem This man, with all his perils passed, Had found sweet Lotus-land at last. XXV The year waxed fervid, and the sun Fell central down. The forest lay A-quiver in the heat. The sea Below the steep bank seemed to run A molten sea of gold. Away Against the gray and rock-built isles That broke the molten watery miles Where lonesome sea-cows called all day, The sudden sun smote angrily. Therefore the need of deeper deeps, Of denser shade for man and maid, Of higher heights, of cooler steeps, Where all day long the sea-wind stayed. They sought the rock-reared steep. The breeze Swept twenty thousand miles of seas; Had twenty thousand things to say, Of love, of lovers of Cathay, To lovers 'mid these mossy trees. XXVI To left, to right, below the height, Below the wood by wave and stream, Plumed pampas grass did wave and gleam And bend their lordly plumes, and run And shake, as if in very fright Before sharp lances of the sun. They saw the tide-bound, battered ship Creep close below against the bank; They saw it cringe and shrink; it shrank As shrinks some huge black beast with fear, When some uncommon dread is near. They heard the melting resin drip, As drip the last brave blood-drops when Red battle waxes hot with men. XXVII Yet what to her were burning seas, Or what to him was forest flame? They loved; they loved the glorious trees; The gleaming tides might rise or fall,— They loved the whispering winds that came From sea-lost spice-set isles unknown, With breath not warmer than their own; They loved, they loved,—and that was all. XXVIII Full noon! Above, the ancient moss From mighty boughs swang slow across, As when some priest slow chants a prayer And swings sweet smoke and perfumed air From censer swinging—anywhere. He spake of love, of boundless love,— Of love that knew no other land, Or face, or place, or anything; Of love that like the wearied dove Could light nowhere, but kept the wing Till she alone put forth her hand And so received it in her ark From seas that shake against the dark! Her proud breast heaved, her pure, bare breast Rose like the waves in their unrest When counter storms possess the seas. Her mouth, her arch, uplifted mouth, Her ardent mouth that thirsted so,— No glowing love song of the South Can say; no man can say or know Such truth as lies beneath such trees. Her face still lifted up. And she Disdained the cup of passion he Hard pressed her panting lips to touch. She dashed it by, uprose, and she Caught fast her breath. She trembled much, Then sudden rose full height, and stood An empress in high womanhood: She stood a tower, tall as when Proud Roman mothers suckled men Of old-time truth and taught them such. XXIX Her soul surged vast as space is. She Was trembling as a courser when His think flank quivers, and his feet Touch velver on the turf, and he Is all afoam, alert and fleet As sunlight glancing on the sea, And full of triumph before men. At last she bended some her face, Half leaned, then put him back a pace, And met his eyes. Calm, silently Her eyes looked deep into his eyes,— As maidens search some mossy well And peer in hope by chance to tell By image there what future lies Before them, and what face shall be The pole-star of their destiny. Pure Nature's lover! Loving him With love that made all pathways dim And difficult where he was not,— Then marvel not at forms forgot. And who shall chide? Doth priest know aught Of sign, or holy unction brought From over seas, that ever can Make man love maid or maid love man One whit the more, one bit the less, For all his mummeries to bless? Yea, all his blessings or his ban? The winds breathed warm as Araby; She leaned upon his breast, she lay A wide-winged swan with folded wing. He drowned his hot face in her hair, He heard her great heart rise and sing; He felt her bosom swell. The air Swooned sweet with perfume of her form. Her breast was warm, her breath was warm, And warm her warm and perfumed mouth As summer journeys through the south. XXX The argent sea surged steep below, Surged languid in such tropic glow; And two great hearts kept surging so! The fervid kiss of heaven lay Precipitate on wood and sea. Two great souls glowed with ecstacy, The sea glowed scarce as warm as they. XXXI 'Twas love's warm amber afternoon. Two far-off pheasants thrummed a tune, A cricket clanged a restful air. The dreamful billows beat a rune Like heart regrets. Around her head There shone a halo. Men have said 'Twas from a dash of Titian red That flooded all her storm of hair In gold and glory. But they knew, Yea, all men know there ever grew A halo round about her head Like sunlight scarcely vanishéd. XXXII How still she was! She only knew His love. She saw no life beyond. She loved with love that only lives Outside itself and selfishness,— A love that glows in its excess; A love that melts pure gold, and gives Thenceforth to all who come to woo No coins but this face stamped thereon,— Ay, this one image stamped upon Pure gold, with some dim date long gone. XXXIII They kept the headland high; the ship Below began to chafe her chain, To groan as some great beast in pain: While white fear leapt from lip to lip: “The woods on fire! The woods in flame! Come down and save us in God's name!” He heard! he did not speak or stir,— He thought of her, of only her, While flames behind, before them lay To hold the stoutest heart at bay! Strange sounds were heard far up the flood Strange, savage sounds that chilled the blood! Then sudden, from the dense, dark wood Above, about them where they stood Strange, hairy beasts came peering out; And now was thrust a long black snout, And now a tusky mouth. It was A sight to make the stoutest pause. “Cut loose the ship!” the black mate cried; “Cut loose the ship!” the crew replied. They drove into the sea. It lay As light as ever middle day. And then a half-blind bitch that sat All slobber-mouthed, and monkish cowled With great, broad, floppy, leathern ears Amid the men, rose up and howled, And doleful howled her plaintive fears, While all looked mute aghast thereat. It was the grimmest eve, I think, That ever hung on Hades' brink. Great broad-winged bats possessed the air, Bats whirling blindly everywhere; It was such troubled twilight eve As never mortal would believe. XXXIV Some say the crazed hag lit the wood In circle where the lovers stood; Some say the gray priest feared the crew Might find at last the hoard of gold Long hidden from the black ship's hold,— I doubt me if men ever knew. But such mad, howling, flame-lit shore No mortal ever knew before. Huge beasts above that shining sea, Wild, hideous beasts with shaggy hair, With red mouths lifting in the air, All piteous howled, and plaintively,— The wildest sounds, the weirdest sight That ever shook the walls of night. How lorn they howled, with lifted head, To dim and distant isles that lay Wedged tight along a line of red, Caught in the closing gates of day 'Twixt sky and sea and far away,— It was the saddest sound to hear That ever struck on human ear. They doleful called; and answered they The plaintiff sea-cows far away,— The great sea-cows that called from isles, Away across red flaming miles, With dripping mouths and lolling tongue, As if they called for captured young,— The huge sea-cows that called the whiles Their great wide mouths were mouthing moss; And still they doleful called across From isles beyond the watery miles. No sound can half so doleful be As sea-cows calling from the sea. XXXV The sun, outdone, lay down. He lay In seas of blood. He sinking drew The gates of sunset sudden to, And they in shattered fragments lay. Then night came, moving in mad flame; Then full night, lighted as he came, As lighted by high summer sun Descending through the burning blue. It was a gold and amber hue, Aye, all hues blended into one. The moon came on, came leaning low. The moon spilled splendor where she came, And filled he world with yellow flame Along the far sea-isles aglow; She fell along that amber flood, A silver flame in seas of blood. It was the strangest moon, ah me! That ever settled on God's sea. XXXVI Slim snakes slid down from fern and grass, From wood, from fen, from anywhere; You could not step, you could not pass, And you would hesitate to stir, Lest in some sudden, hurried tread Your foot struck some unbruiséd head: It seemed like some infernal dream; They slid in streams into the stream; They curved and sinuous curved across, Like living streams of living moss,— There is no art of man can make A ripple like a swimming snake! XXXVII Encompassed, lorn, the lovers stood, Abandoned there, death in the air! That beetling steep, that blazing wood— Red flame! red flame, and everywhere! Yet he was born to strive, to bear The front of battle. He would die In noble effort, and defy The grizzled visage of despair. He threw his two strong arms full length As if to surely test their strength; Then tore his vestments, textile things That could but tempt the demon wings Of flame that girt them round about, Then threw his garments to the air As one that laughed at death, at doubt, And like a god stood thewed and bare. She did not hesitate; she knew The need of action; swift she threw Her burning vestments by, and bound Her wondrous wealth of hair that fell An all-concealing cloud around Her glorious presence, as he came To seize and bear her through the flame,— An Orpheus out of burning hell! He leaned above her, wound his arm About her splendor, while the noon Of flood tide, manhood, flushed his face, And high flames leapt the high headland!— They stood as twin-hewn statues stand, High lifted in some storied place. He clasped her close, he spoke of death,— Of death and love in the same breath. He clasped her close; her bosom lay Like ship safe anchored in some bay, Where never rage or rack of main Might even shake her anchor chain. XXXVIII The flames! They could not stand or stay; Beyond, the beetling steep, the sea! But at his feet a narrow way, A short steep path, pitched suddenly Safe open to the river's beach, Where lay a small white isle in reach,— A small, white, rippled isle of sand Where yet the two might safely land. And there, through smoke and flame, behold The priest stood safe, yet all appalled! He reached the cross; he cried, he called; He waved his high-held cross of gold. He called and called, he bade them fly Through flames to him, nor bide and die! Her lover saw; he saw, and knew His giant strength could bear her through. And yet he would not start or stir. He clasped her close as death can hold, Or dying miser clasp his gold,— His hold became a part of her. He would not give her up! He would Not bear her waveward though he could! That height was heaven; the wave was hell. He clasped her close,—what else had done The manliest man beneath the sun? Was it not well? was it not well? O man, be glad! be grandly glad, And king-like walk thy ways of death! For more than years of bliss you had That one brief time you breathed her breath, Yea, more than years upon a throne That one brief time you held her fast, Soul surged to soul, vehement, vast,— True breast to breast, and all your own. Live me one day, one narrow night, One second of supreme delight Like that, and I will blow like chaff The hollow years aside, and laugh A loud triumphant laugh, and I, King-like and crowned, will gladly die. Oh, but to wrap my love with flame! With flame within, with flame without! Oh, but to die like this, nor doubt— To die and know her still the same! To know that down the ghostly shore Snow-white she walks for ever more! XXXIX He poised her, held her high in air,— His great strong limbs, his great arm's length!— Then turned his knotted shoulders bare As birth-time in his splendid strength, And strode with lordly, kingly stride To where the high and wood-hung edge Looked down, far down upon the molten tide. The flames leaped with him to the ledge, The flames leapt leering at his side. XL He leaned above the ledge. Below He saw the black ship grope and cruise,— A midge below, a mile below. His limbs were knotted as the thews Of Hercules in his death-throe. The flame! the flame! the envious flame! She wound her arms, she wound her hair About his tall form, grand and bare, To stay the fierce flame where it came. The black ship, like some moonlit wreck, Below along the burning sea Groped on and on all silently, With silent pigmies on her deck. That midge-like ship, far, far below; That mirage lifting from the hill! His flame-lit form began to grow,— To glow and grow more grandly still. The ship so small, that form so tall, It grew to tower over all. A tall Colossus, bronze and gold, As if that flame-lit form were he Who once bestrode the Rhodian sea, And ruled the watery world of old: As if the lost Colossus stood Above that burning sea of wood. And she! that shapely form upheld, Held high as if to touch the sky, What airy shape, how shapely high,— What goddess of the seas of eld! Her hand upheld, her high right hand, As if she would forget the land; As if to gather stars, and heap The stars like torches there to light Her hero's path across the deep To some far isle that fearful night. XLI The envious flame, one moment leapt Enraged to see such majesty, Such scorn of death; such kingly scorn .. Then like some lightning-riven tree They sank down in that flame—and slept. Then all was hushed above that steep So still that they might sleep and sleep, As when a Summer's day is born. At last! from out the embers leapt Two shafts of light above the night,— Two wings of flame that lifting swept In steady, calm, and upward flight; Two wings of flame against the white Far-lifting, tranquil, snowy cone; Two wings of love, two wings of light, Far, far above that troubled night, As mounting, mounting to God's throne. XLII And all night long that upward light Lit up the sea-cow's bed below: The far sea-cows still calling so It seemed as they must call all night. All night! there was no night. Nay, nay, There was no night. The night that lay Between that awful eve and day,— That nameless night was burned away. Byron, Keats, Shelley, Browning, all poets, as a rule fled from the commercial centers, went out from under the mists and mirk into the sunlight to sing. I warn the coming poet that as a poet his place is not in any city. Be advised, or have done with aspiration to do new work or true work. The Old World has been written, written fully and bravely and well. It is only the vast, far, New World that needs you. He who is aiming to sit down in New York, or any city, and eat dinners that are cooked and seasoned by servants who are not given even as much time to go to church as were the slaves of the South, may be good enough and write well enough to please the city in these headlong days, but the real poet would rather house with a half savage and live on a sixpence in some mountain village, as did Byron, than feast off the board of Madame Leo Hunter in a city. Nor is Washington a better place for work with soul or heart in it. Madame Leo Hunter is there also, persistent, numerous, superficial and soulless as in almost any great center. If I am cruel, O my coming poets, I am cruel to be kind. Go forth in the sun, away into the wilds or contentedly lay aside your aspirations of song. Now, mark you distinctly, I am not writing for nor of the poets of the Old World or the Atlantic seaboard. They have their work and their ways of work. My notes are for the songless Alaskas, Canadas, Californias, the Aztec lands and the Argentines that patiently await their coming prophets. For come they will; but I warn them they will have to gird themselves mightily and pass through fire, and perish, many a man; for these new worlds will be whistling, out of time, the tunes of the old, and the rich and the proud will say in their insolence and ignorance, “Pipe thus, for thus piped the famous pipers of old; piping of perished kings, of wars, of castle walls, of battling knights, and of maids betrayed. Sing as of old or be silent, for we know not, we want not, and we will not, your seas of colors, your forests of perfumes, your mountains of melodies.” THE SHIP IN THE DESERT A wild, wide land of mysteries, Of sea-salt lakes and dried up seas, And lonely wells and pools; a land That seems so like dead Palestine, Save that its wastes have no confine Till push'd against the levell'd skies. A land from out whose depths shall rise The new-time prophets. Yea, the land From out whose awful depths shall come, A lowly man, with dusty feet, A man fresh from his Maker's hand, A singer singing oversweet, A charmer charming very wise; And then all men shall not be dumb. Nay, not be dumb; for he shall say, “Take heed, for I prepare the way For weary feet.” Lo! from this land Of Jordan streams and dead sea sand, The Christ shall come when next the race Of man shall look upon His face. I A man in middle Aridzone Stood by the desert's edge alone, And long he look'd, and lean'd and peer'd, And twirl'd and twirl'd his twist'd beard, Beneath a black and slouchy hat— Nay, nay, the tale is not of that. A skin-clad trapper, toe-a-tip, Stood on a mountain top; and he Look'd long, and still, and eagerly. “It looks so like some lonesome ship That sails this ghostly, lonely sea,— This dried-up desert sea,” said he, “These tawny sands of buried seas”— Avaunt! this tale is not of these! A chief from out the desert's rim Rode swift as twilight swallows swim, And O! his supple steed was fleet! About his breast flapped panther skins, About his eager flying feet Flapp'd beaded, braided moccasins: He stopp'd, stock still, as still as stone, He lean'd, he look'd, there glisten'd bright, From out the yellow, yielding sand, A golden cup with jewell'd rim. He lean'd him low, he reach'd a hand, He caught it up, he gallop'd on, He turn'd his head, he saw a sight— His panther-skins flew to the wind, He rode into the rim of night; The dark, the desert lay behind; The tawny Ishmaelite was gone. He reach'd the town, and there held up Above his head the jewel'd cup. He put two fingers to his lip, He whisper'd wild, he stood a-tip, And lean'd the while with lifted hand, And said, “A ship lies yonder dead,” And said, “Such things lie sown in sand In yon far desert dead and brown, Beyond where wave-wash'd walls look down, As thick as stars set overhead.” “'Tis from that desert ship,” they said, “That sails with neither sail nor breeze The lonely bed of dried-up seas,— A galleon that sank below White seas ere Red men drew the bow.” By Arizona's sea of sand Some bearded miners, gray and old, And resolute in search of gold, Sat down to tap the savage land. A miner stood beside the mine, He pull'd his beard, then looked away Across the level sea of sand, Beneath his broad and hairy hand, A hand as hard as knots of pine. “It looks so like a sea,” said he. He pull'd his beard, and he did say, “It looks just like a dried-up sea.” Again he pull'd that beard of his, But said no other thing than this. A stalwart miner dealt a stroke, And struck a buried beam of oak. The miner twisted, twirl'd his beard, Lean'd on his pick-ax as he spoke: “'Tis that same long-lost ship,” he said, “Some laden ship of Solomon That sail'd these lonesome seas upon In search of Ophir's mine, ah me! That sail'd this dried-up desert sea.” II Now this the tale. Along the wide Missouri's stream some silent braves, That stole along the farther side Through sweeping wood that swept the waves Like long arms reach'd across the tide, Kept watch and every foe defied. A low, black boat that hugg'd the shores, An ugly boat, an ugly crew, Thick-lipp'd and woolly-headed slaves, That bow'd, and bent the white-ash oars, That cleft the murky waters through, Slow climb'd the swift Missouri's waves. A grand old Neptune in the prow, Gray-hair'd, and white with touch of time, Yet strong as in his middle prime, Stood up, turn'd suddenly, look'd back Along his low boat's wrinkled track, Then drew his mantle tight, and now He sat all silently. Beside The grim old sea-king sat his bride, A sun land blossom, rudely torn From tropic forests to be worn Above as stern a breast as e'er Stood king at sea, or anywhere. Another boat with other crew Came swift and cautious in her track, And now shot shoreward, now shot back, And now sat rocking fro and to, But never once lost sight of her. Tall, sunburnt, southern men were these From isles of blue Caribbean seas, And one, that woman's worshiper, Who look'd on her, and loved but her. And one, that one, was wild as seas That wash the far, dark Oregon. And one, that one, had eyes to teach The art of love, and tongue to preach Life's hard and sober homilies, While he stood leaning, urging on. III Pursuer and pursued. And who Are these that make the sable crew; These mighty Titans, black and nude, Who dare this Red man's solitude? And who is he that leads them here, And breaks the hush of wave and wood? Comes he for evil or for good? Brave Jesuit or bold buccaneer? Nay, these be idle themes. Let pass. These be but men. We may forget The wild sea-king, the tawny brave, The frowning wold, the woody shore, The tall-built, sunburnt man of Mars. But what and who was she, the fair? The fairest face that ever yet Look'd in a wave as in a glass; That look'd, as look the still, far stars, So woman-like, into the wave To contemplate their beauty there? I only saw her, heard the sound Of murky waters gurgling round In counter-currents from the shore, But heard the long, strong stroke of oar Against the water gray and vast; I only saw her as she pass'd— A great, sad beauty, in whose eyes Lay all the peace of Paradise. O you had loved her sitting there, Half hidden in her loosen'd hair; Yea, loved her for her large dark eyes, Her push'd out mouth, her mute surprise— Her mouth! 'twas Egypt's mouth of old, Push'd out and pouting full and bold With simple beauty where she sat. Why, you had said, on seeing her, This creature comes from out the dim, Far centuries, beyond the rim Of time's remotest reach or stir; And he who wrought Semiramis And shaped the Sibyls, seeing this, Had kneeled and made a shrine thereat, And all his life had worshipp'd her. IV The black men bow'd, the long oars bent, They struck as if for sweet life's sake, And one look'd back, but no man spake, And all wills bent to one intent. On, through the golden fringe of day Into the deep, dark night, away And up the wave 'mid walls of wood They cleft, they climb'd, they bow'd, they bent, But one stood tall, and restless stood, And one sat still all night, all day, And gazed in helpless wonderment. Her hair pour'd down like darkling wine, The black men lean'd a sullen line, The bent oars kept a steady song, And all the beams of bright sunshine That touch'd the waters wild and strong, Fell drifting down and out of sight Like fallen leaves, and it was night. And night and day, and many days They climb'd the sullen, dark gray tide. And she sat silent at his side, And he sat turning many ways; Sat watching for his wily foe. At last he baffled him. And yet His brow gloom'd dark, his lips were set; He lean'd, he peer'd through boughs, as though From heart of forests deep and dim Grim shapes might come confronting him. A stern, uncommon man was he, Broad-shoulder'd, as of Gothic form, Strong-built, and hoary like a sea; A high sea broken up by storm. His face was brown and over-wrought By seams and shadows born of thought, Not over-gentle. And his eyes, Bold, restless, resolute and deep, Too deep to flow like shallow fount Of common men where waters mount;— Fierce, lumined eyes, where flames might rise Instead of flood, and flash and sweep— Strange eyes, that look'd unsatisfied With all things fair or otherwise; As if his inmost soul had cried All time for something yet unseen, Some long-desired thing denied. V Below the overhanging boughs The oars lay idle at the last; Yet long he look'd for hostile prows From out the wood and down the stream. They came not, and he came to dream Pursuit abandon'd, danger past. He fell'd the oak, he built a home Of new-hewn wood with busy hand, And said, “My wanderings are told,” And said, “No more by sea, by land, Shall I break rest, or drift, or roam, For I am worn, and I grow old.” And there, beside that surging tide, Where gray waves meet, and wheel, and strike, The man sat down as satisfied To sit and rest unto the end; As if the strong man here had found A sort of brother in this sea,— This surging, sounding majesty, Of troubled water, so profound, So sullen, strong, and lion-like, So lawless in its every round. Hast seen Missouri cleave the wood In sounding whirlpools to the sea? What soul hath known such majesty? What man stood by and understood? VI Now long the long oars idle lay. The cabin's smoke came forth and curl'd Right lazily from river brake, And Time went by the other way. And who was she, the strong man's pride, This one fair woman of his world? A captive? Bride, or not a bride? Her eyes, men say, grew sad and dim With watching from the river's rim, As waiting for some face denied. Yea, who was she? none ever knew. The great, strong river swept around The cabin nestled in its bend, But kept its secrets. Wild birds flew In bevies by. The black men found Diversion in the chase; and wide Old Morgan ranged the wood, nor friend Nor foeman ever sought his side, Or shared his forests deep and dim, Or cross'd his path or question'd him. He stood as one who found and named The middle world. What visions flamed Athwart the west! What prophecies Were his, the gray old man, that day Who stood alone and look'd away,— Awest from out the waving trees, Against the utter sundown seas. Alone ofttime beside the stream He stood and gazed as in a dream,— As if he knew a life unknown To those who knew him thus alone. His eyes were gray and overborne By shaggy brows, his strength was shorn, Yet still he ever gazed awest, As one that would not, could not rest. And had he fled with bloody hand? Or had he loved some Helen fair, And battling lost both land and town? Say, did he see his walls go down, Then choose from all his treasures there This one, and seek some other land? VII The squirrels chatter'd in the leaves, The turkeys call'd from pawpaw wood, The deer with lifted nostrils stood, 'Mid climbing blossoms sweet with bee, 'Neath snow-white rose of Cherokee. Then frosts hung ices on the eaves, Then cushion snows possess'd the ground, And so the seasons kept their round; Yet still old Morgan went and came From cabin door through forest dim, Through wold of snows, through wood of flame, Through golden Indian-summer days, Hung red with soft September haze, And no man cross'd or questioned him. Nay, there was that in his stern air That held e'en these rude men aloof; None came to share the broad-built roof That rose so fortress-like beside The angry, rushing, sullen tide, And only black men gather'd there, The old man's slaves in dull content, Black, silent, and obedient. Then men push'd westward through his wood, His wild beasts fled, and now he stood Confronting men. He had endear'd No man, but still he went and came Apart, and shook his beard and strode His ways alone, and bore his load, If load it were, apart, alone. Then men grew busy with a name That no man loved, that many fear'd, And rude men stoop'd, and cast a stone, As at some statue overthrown. Some said, a stolen bride was she, And that her lover from the sea Lay waiting for his chosen wife, And that a day of reckoning Lay waiting for this grizzled king. Some said that looking from her place A love would sometimes light her face, As if sweet recollections stirr'd Like far, sweet songs that come to us, So soft, so sweet, they are not heard, So far, so faint, they fill the air, A fragrance falling anywhere. So, wasting all her summer years That utter'd only through her tears, The seasons went, and still she stood Forever watching down the wood. Yet in her heart there held a strife With all this wasting of sweet life, That none who have not lived—and died— Held up the two hands crucified Between two ways—can understand. Men went and came, and still she stood In silence watching down the wood— Adown the wood beyond the land, Her hollow face upon her hand, Her black, abundant hair all down About her loose, ungather'd gown. And what her thought? her life unsaid? Was it of love? of hate? of him, The tall, dark Southerner? Her head Bow'd down. The day fell dim Upon her eyes. She bowed, she slept. She waken'd then, and waking wept. VIII The black-eyed bushy squirrels ran Like shadows scattered through the boughs; The gallant robin chirp'd his vows, The far-off pheasant thrumm'd his fan, A thousand blackbirds kept on wing In walnut-top, and it was Spring. Old Morgan sat his cabin door, And one sat watching as of yore, But why turn'd Morgan's face as white As his white beard? A bird aflight, A squirrel peering through the trees, Saw some one silent steal away Like darkness from the face of day, Saw two black eyes look back, and these Saw her hand beckon through the trees. Ay! they have come, the sun-brown'd men, To beard old Morgan in his den. It matters little who they are, These silent men from isles afar; And truly no one cares or knows What be their merit or demand; It is enough for this rude land— At least, it is enough for those, The loud of tongue and rude of hand— To know that they are Morgan's foes. Proud Morgan! More than tongue can tell He loved that woman watching there, That stood in her dark storm of hair, That stood and dream'd as in a spell, And look'd so fix'd and far away; And who that loveth woman well, Is wholly bad? be whom he may. IX Ay! we have seen these Southern men, These sun-brown'd men from island shore, In this same land, and long before. They do not seem so lithe as then, They do not look so tall, and they Seem not so many as of old. But that same resolute and bold Expression of unbridled will, That even Time must half obey, Is with them and is of them still. They do not counsel the decree Of court or council, where they drew Their breath, nor law nor order knew, Save but the strong hand of the strong; Where each stood up, avenged his wrong, Or sought his death all silently. They watch along the wave and wood, They heed, but haste not. Their estate, Whate'er it be, can bide and wait, Be it open ill or hidden good. No law for them! For they have stood With steel, and writ their rights in blood; And now, whatever 't is they seek, Whatever be their dark demand, Why, they will make it, hand to hand, Take time and patience: Greek to Greek. X Like blown and snowy wintry pine, Old Morgan stoop'd his head and pass'd Within his cabin door. He cast A great arm out to men, made sign, Then turn'd to Sybal; stood beside A time, then turn'd and strode the floor, Stopp'd short, breathed sharp, threw wide the door, Then gazed beyond the murky tide, Past where the forky peaks divide. He took his beard in his right hand, Then slowly shook his grizzled head And trembled, but no word he said. His thought was something more than pain; Upon the seas, upon the land He knew he should not rest again. He turn'd to her; and then once more Quick turn'd, and through the oaken door He sudden pointed to the west. His eye resumed its old command, The conversation of his hand It was enough; she knew the rest. He turn'd, he stoop'd, and smooth'd her hair, As if to smooth away the care From his great heart, with his left hand. His right hand hitch'd the pistol 'round That dangled at his belt. The sound Of steel to him was melody More sweet than any song of sea. He touch'd his pistol, push'd his lips, Then tapp'd it with his finger tips, And toy'd with it as harper's hand Seeks out the chords when he is sad And purposeless. At last he had Resolved. In haste he touch'd her hair, Made sign she should arise—prepare For some long journey, then again He look'd awest toward the plain; Against the land of boundless space, The land of silences, the land Of shoreless deserts sown with sand, Where Desolation's dwelling is; The land where, wondering, you say, What dried-up shoreless sea is this? Where, wandering, from day to day You say, To-morrow sure we come To rest in some cool resting place, And yet you journey on through space While seasons pass, and are struck dumb With marvel at the distances. Yea, he would go. Go utterly Away, and from all living kind; Pierce through the distances, and find New lands. He had outlived his race. He stood like some eternal tree That tops remote Yosemite, And cannot fall. He turn'd his face Again and contemplated space. And then he raised his hand to vex His beard, stood still, and there fell down Great drops from some unfrequent spring, And streak'd his channell'd cheeks sunbrown, And ran uncheck'd, as one who recks Nor joy, nor tears, nor anything. And then, his broad breast heaving deep, Like some dark sea in troubled sleep, Blown round with groaning ships and wrecks, He sudden roused himself, and stood With all the strength of his stern mood, Then call'd his men, and bade them go And bring black steeds with banner'd necks, And strong, like burly buffalo. XI The bronzen, stolid, still, black men Their black-maned horses silent drew Through solemn wood. One midnight when The curl'd moon tipp'd her horn, and threw A black oak's shadow slant across A low mound hid in leaves and moss, Old Morgan cautious came and drew From out the ground, as from a grave, Great bags, all copper-bound and old, And fill'd, men say, with pirates' gold. And then they, silent as a dream, In long black shadow cross'd the stream. XII And all was life at morn, but one, The tall old sea-king, grim and gray, Look'd back to where his cabin lay, And seem'd to hesitate. He rose At last, as from his dream's repose, From rest that counterfeited rest, And set his blown beard to the west; And rode against the setting sun, Far up the levels vast and dun. His steeds were steady, strong and fleet, The best in all the wide west land, Their manes were in the air, their feet Seem'd scarce to touch the flying sand. They rode like men gone mad, they fled All day and many days they ran, And in the rear a gray old man Kept watch, and ever turn'd his head Half eager and half angry, back Along their dusty desert track. And she look'd back, but no man spoke, They rode, they swallowed up the plain; The sun sank low, he look'd again, With lifted hand and shaded eyes. Then far, afar, he saw uprise, As if from giant's stride or stroke, Dun dust, like puffs of battle-smoke. He turn'd, his left hand clutched the rein, He struck hard west his high right hand, His limbs were like the limbs of oak; All knew too well the man's command. On, on they spurred, they plunged again, And one look'd back, but no man spoke. They climb'd the rock-built breasts of earth, The Titan-fronted, blowy steeps That cradled Time. Where freedom keeps Her flag of bright, blown stars unfurl'd, They climbed and climbed. They saw the birth Of sudden dawn upon the world; Again they gazed; they saw the face Of God, and named it boundless space. And they descended and did roam Through levell'd distances set round By room. They saw the Silences Move by and beckon; saw the forms, The very beards, of burly storms, And heard them talk like sounding seas. On unnamed heights, bleak-blown and brown, And torn-like battlements of Mars, They saw the darknesses come down, Like curtains loosen'd from the dome Of God's cathedral, built of stars. They pitch'd the tent where rivers run All foaming to the west, and rush As if to drown the falling sun. They saw the snowy mountains roll'd, And heaved along the nameless lands Like mighty billows; saw the gold Of awful sunsets; felt the hush Of heaven when the day sat down, And drew about his mantle brown, And hid his face in dusky hands. The long and lonesome nights! the tent That nestled soft in sweep of grass, The hills against the firmament Where scarce the moving moon could pass; The cautious camp, the smother'd light, The silent sentinel at night! The wild beasts howling from the hill; The savage prowling swift and still, And bended as a bow is bent. The arrow sent; the arrow spent And buried in its bloody place; The dead man lying on his face! The clouds of dust, their cloud by day; Their pillar of unfailing fire The far North Star. And high, and higher, They climb'd so high it seemed eftsoon That they must face the falling moon, That like some flame-lit ruin lay High built before their weary way. They learn'd to read the sign of storms, The moon's wide circles, sunset bars, And storm-provoking blood and flame; And, like the Chaldean shepherds, came At night to name the moving stars. In heaven's face they pictured forms Of beasts, of fishes of the sea. They watch'd the Great Bear wearily Rise up and drag his clinking chain Of stars around the starry main. XIII And why did these worn, sun-burnt men Let Morgan gain the plain, and then Pursue him ever where he fled? Some say their leader sought but her; Unlike each swarthy follower. Some say they sought his gold alone, And fear'd to make their quarrel known Lest it should keep its secret bed; Some say they thought to best prevail And conquer with united hands Alone upon the lonesome sands; Some say they had as much to dread; Some say—but I must tell my tale. And still old Morgan sought the west; The sea, the utmost sea, and rest. He climb'd, descended, climb'd again, Until pursuit seemed all in vain; Until they left him all alone, As unpursued and as unknown, As some lost ship upon the main. O there was grandeur in his air, An old-time splendor in his eye, When he had climb'd at last the high And rock-built bastions of the plain, Thrown back his beard and blown white hair, And halting turn'd to look again. Dismounting in his lofty place, He look'd far down the fading plain For his pursuers, but in vain. Yea, he was glad. Across his face A careless smile was seen to play, The first for many a stormy day. He turn'd to Sybal, dark, yet fair As some sad twilight; touched her hair, Stoop'd low, and kiss'd her gently there, Then silent held her to his breast; Then waved command to his black men, Look'd east, then mounted slow and then Led leisurely against the west. And why should he who dared to die, Who more than once with hissing breath Had set his teeth and pray'd for death? Why fled these men, or wherefore fly Before them now? why not defy? His midnight men were strong and true, And not unused to strife, and knew The masonry of steel right well, And all such signs that lead to hell. It might have been his youth had wrought Some wrongs his years would now repair, That made him fly and still forbear; It might have been he only sought To lead them to some fatal snare, And let them die by piecemeal there. I only know it was not fear Of any man or any thing That death in any shape might bring. It might have been some lofty sense Of his own truth and innocence, And virtues lofty as severe— Nay, nay! what room for reasons here? And now they pierced a fringe of trees That bound a mountain's brow like bay. Sweet through the fragrant boughs a breeze Blew salt-flood freshness. Far away, From mountain brow to desert base Lay chaos, space; unbounded space. The black men cried, “The sea!” They bow'd Black, woolly heads in hard black hands. They wept for joy. They laugh'd, they broke The silence of an age, and spoke Of rest at last; and, grouped in bands, They threw their long black arms about Each other's necks, and laugh'd aloud, Then wept again with laugh and shout. Yet Morgan spake no word, but led His band with oft-averted head Right through the cooling trees, till he Stood out upon the lofty brow And mighty mountain wall. And now The men who shouted, “Lo, the sea!” Rode in the sun; sad, silently, Rode in the sun, and look'd below. They look'd but once, then look'd away, Then look'd each other in the face. They could not lift their brows, nor say, But held their heads, nor spake, for lo! Nor sea, nor voice of sea, nor breath Of sea, but only sand and death, The dread mirage, the fiend of space! XIV Old Morgan eyed his men, look'd back Against the groves of tamarack, Then tapp'd his stirrup foot, and stray'd His broad left hand along the mane Of his strong steed, and careless play'd His fingers through the silken skein. And then he spurr'd him to her side, And reach'd his hand and leaning wide, He smiling push'd her falling hair Back from her brow, and kiss'd her there. Yea, touch'd her softly, as if she Had been some priceless, tender flower; Yet touched her as one taking leave Of his one love in lofty tower Before descending to the sea Of battle on his battle eve. A distant shout! quick oaths! alarms! The black men start, turn suddenly, Stand in the stirrup, clutch their arms, And bare bright arms all instantly. But he, he slowly turns, and he Looks all his full soul in her face. He does not shout, he does not say, But sits serenely in his place A time, then slowly turns, looks back Between the trim-boughed tamarack, And up the winding mountain way, To where the long, strong grasses lay, And there they came, hot on his track! He raised his glass in his two hands, Then in his left hand let it fall, Then seem'd to count his fingers o'er, Then reached his glass, waved his commands, Then tapped his stirrup as before, Stood in the stirrup stern and tall, Then ran a hand along the mane Half-nervous like, and that was all. And then he turn'd, and smiled half sad, Half desperate, then hitch'd his steel; Then all his stormy presence had, As if he kept once more his keel, On pirate seas where breakers reel. At last he tossed his iron hand Above the deep, steep desert space, Above the burning seas of sand, And look'd his black men in the face. They spake not, nor look'd back again, They struck the heel, they clutched the rein, And down the darkling plunging steep They dropp'd into the dried-up deep. Below! It seem'd a league below, The black men rode, and she rode well, Against the gleaming, sheening haze That shone like some vast sea ablaze— That seem'd to gleam, to glint, to glow, As if it mark'd the shores of hell. Then Morgan reined alone, look'd back From off the high wall where he stood, And watch'd his fierce approaching foe. He saw him creep along his track, Saw him descending from the wood, And smiled to see how worn and slow. And Morgan heard his oath and shout, And Morgan turned his head once more, And wheel'd his stout steed short about, Then seem'd to count their numbers o'er. And then his right hand touch'd his steel, And then he tapp'd his iron heel, And seemed to fight with thought. At last As if the final die was cast, And cast as carelessly as one Would toss a white coin in the sun, He touched his rein once more, and then His right hand laid with idle heed Along the toss'd mane of his steed. Pursuer and pursued! who knows The why he left the breezy pine, The fragrant tamarack and vine, Red rose and precious yellow rose! Nay, Vasques held the vantage ground Above him by the wooded steep, And right nor left no passage lay, And there was left him but that way,— The way through blood, or to the deep And lonesome deserts far profound, That knew not sight of man, nor sound. Hot Vasques reined upon the rim, High, bold, and fierce with crag and spire. He saw a far gray eagle swim, He saw a black hawk wheel, retire, And shun that desert's burning breath As shunning something more than death. Ah, then he paused, turn'd, shook his head. “And shall we turn aside,” he said, “Or dare this Death?” The men stood still As leaning on his sterner will. And then he stoop'd and turn'd again, And held his broad hand to his brow, And look'd intent and eagerly. The far white levels of the plain Flash'd back like billows. Even now He thought he saw rise up 'mid sea, 'Mid space, 'mid wastes, 'mid nothingness A ship becalm'd as in distress. The dim sign pass'd as suddenly, And then his eager eyes grew dazed,— He brought his two hands to his face. Again he raised his head, and gazed With flashing eyes and visage fierce Far out, and resolute to pierce The far, far, faint receding reach Of space and touch its farther beach. He saw but space, unbounded space; Eternal space and nothingness. Then all wax'd anger'd as they gazed Far out upon the shoreless land, And clench'd their doubled hands and raised Their long bare arms, but utter'd not. At last one rode from out the band, And raised his arm, push'd back his sleeve, Push'd bare his arm, rode up and down, With hat push'd back. Then flush'd and hot He shot sharp oaths like cannon shot. Then Vasques was resolved; his form Seem'd like a pine blown rampt with storm. He clutch'd his rein, drove spur, and then Turn'd sharp and savage to his men, And then led boldly down the way To night that knows not night or day. XV How broken plunged the steep descent! How barren! Desolate, and rent By earthquake's shock, the land lay dead, With dust and ashes on its head. 'Twas as some old world overthrown Where Thesus fought and Sappho dream'd In æons ere they touch'd this land, And found their proud souls foot and hand Bound to the flesh and stung with pain. An ugly skeleton it seem'd Of its old self. The fiery rain Of red volcanoes here had sown The desolation of the plain. Ay, vanquish'd quite and overthrown, And torn with thunder-stroke, and strown With cinders, lo! the dead earth lay As waiting for the judgment day. Why, tamer men had turn'd and said, On seeing this, with start and dread, And whisper'd each with gather'd breath, “We come on the abode of death.” They wound below a savage bluff That lifted, from its sea-mark'd base, Great walls with characters cut rough And deep by some long-perish'd race; And great, strange beasts unnamed, unknown, Stood hewn and limn'd upon the stone. A mournful land as land can be Beneath their feet in ashes lay, Beside that dread and dried-up sea; A city older than that gray And sand down tower builded when Confusion cursed the tongues of men. Beneath, before, a city lay That in her majesty had shamed The wolf-nursed conqueror of old; Below, before, and far away, There reach'd the white arm of a bay, A broad bay shrunk to sand and stone, Where ships had rode and breakers roll'd When Babylon was yet unnamed, And Nimrod's hunting-fields unknown. Where sceptered kings had sat at feast Some serpents slid from out the grass That grew in tufts by shatter'd stone, Then hid beneath some broken mass That time had eaten as a bone Is eaten by some savage beast. A dull-eyed rattlesnake that lay All loathsome, yellow-skinn'd, and slept, Coil'd tight as pine-knot, in the sun, With flat head through the center run, Struck blindly back, then rattling crept Flat-bellied down the dusty way ... 'Twas all the dead land had to say. Two pink-eyed hawks, wide-wing'd and gray, Scream'd savagely, and, circling high, And screaming still in mad dismay, Grew dim and died against the sky ... 'Twas all the heavens had to say. Some low-built junipers at last, The last that o'er the desert look'd, Where dumb owls sat with bent bills hook'd Beneath their wings awaiting night, Rose up, then faded from the sight. What dim ghosts hover on this rim: What stately-manner'd shadows swim Along these gleaming wastes of sands And shoreless limits of dead lands? Dread Azteckee! Dead Azteckee! White place of ghosts, give up thy dead; Give back to Time thy buried hosts! The new world's tawny Ishmaelite, The roving tent-born Shoshonee, Hath shunned thy shores of death, at night Because thou art so white, so dread, Because thou art so ghostly white, And named thy shores “the place of ghosts.” Thy white, uncertain sands are white With bones of thy unburied dead, That will not perish from the sight. They drown, but perish not—ah me! What dread unsightly sights are spread Along this lonesome, dried-up sea? Old, hoar, and dried-up sea! so old So strown with wealth, so sown with gold! Yea, thou art old and hoary white With time, and ruin of all things; And on thy lonesome borders Night Sits brooding as with wounded wings. The winds that toss'd thy waves and blew Across thy breast the blowing sail, And cheer'd the hearts of cheering crew From farther seas, no more prevail. Thy white-wall'd cities all lie prone, With but a pyramid, a stone, Set head and foot in sands to tell The thirsting stranger where they fell. The patient ox that bended low His neck, and drew slow up and down Thy thousand freights through rock-built town Is now the free-born buffalo. No longer of the timid fold, The mountain ram leaps free and bold His high-built summit, and looks down From battlements of buried town. Thine ancient steeds know not the rein; They lord the land; they come, they go At will; they laugh at man; they blow A cloud of black steeds o'er the plain. The winds, the waves, have drawn away— The very wild man dreads to stay. XVI Away! upon the sandy seas The gleaming, burning, boundless plain; How solemn-like, how still, as when That mighty minded Genoese Drew three slim ships and led his men From land they might not meet again. The black men rode in front by two, The fair one follow'd close, and kept Her face held down as if she wept; But Morgan kept the rear, and threw His flowing, swaying beard still back In watch along their lonesome track. The weary Day fell down to rest, A star upon his mantled breast, Ere scarce the sun fell out of space, And Venus glimmer'd in his place. Yea, all the stars shone just as fair, And constellations kept their round, And look'd from out the great profound, And march'd, and countermarch'd, and shone Upon that desolation there— Why, just the same as if proud man Strode up and down array'd in gold And purple as in days of old, And reckon'd all of his own plan, Or made at least for man alone. Yet on push'd Morgan silently, And straight as strong ship on a sea; And ever as he rode there lay— To right, to left, and in his way, Strange objects looming in the dark, Some like tall mast, or ark, or bark. And things half-hidden in the sand Lay down before them where they pass'd— A broken beam, half-buried mast, A spar or bar, such as might be Blown crosswise, tumbled on the strand Of some sail-crowded, stormy sea. All night by moon, by morning star, The still, black men still kept their way; All night till morn, till burning day Hard Vasques follow'd fast and far. The sun is high, the sands are hot To touch, and all the tawny plain Sinks white and open as they tread And trudge, with half-averted head, As if to swallow them in sand. They look, as men look back to land When standing out to stormy sea, But still keep pace and murmur not; Keep stern and still as destiny. It was a sight! A slim dog slid White-mouth'd and still along the sand, The pleading picture of distress. He stopp'd, leap'd up to lick a hand, A hard, black hand that sudden chid Him back, and check'd his tenderness. Then when the black man turn'd his head, His poor, mute friend had fallen dead. The very air hung white with heat, And white, and fair, and far away A lifted, shining snow-shaft lay As if to mock their mad retreat. The white, salt sands beneath their feet Did make the black men loom as grand, From out the lifting, heaving heat, As they rode sternly on and on, As any bronze men in the land That sit their statue steeds upon. The men were silent as men dead. The sun hung centered overhead, Nor seem'd to move. It molten hung Like some great central burner swung From lofty beams with golden bars In sacristy set round with stars. Why, flame could hardly be more hot; Yet on the mad pursuer came Across the gleaming, yielding ground, Right on, as if he fed on flame, Right on until the mid-day found The man within a pistol-shot. He hail'd, but Morgan answered not; He hail'd, then came a feeble shot, And strangely, in that vastness there, It seem'd to scarcely fret the air, But fell down harmless anywhere. He fiercely hail'd; and then there fell A horse. And then a man fell down, And in the sea-sand seem'd to drown. Then Vasques cursed, but scarce could tell The sound of his own voice, and all In mad confusion seem'd to fall. Yet on pushed Morgan, silent on, And as he rode, he lean'd and drew From his catenas gold, and threw The bright coins in the glaring sun. But Vasques did not heed a whit, He scarcely deign'd to scowl at it. Again lean'd Morgan. He uprose, And held a high hand to his foes, And held two goblets up, and one Did shine as if itself a sun. Then leaning backward from his place, He hurl'd them in his foeman's face; Then drew again, and so kept on, Till goblets, gold, and all were gone. Yea, strew'd all out upon the sands As men upon a frosty morn, In Mississippi's fertile lands, Hurl out great yellow ears of corn, To hungry swine with hurried hands. Yet still hot Vasques urges on, With flashing eye and flushing cheek. What would he have? what does he seek? He does not heed the gold a whit, He does not deign to look at it; But now his gleaming steel is drawn, And now he leans, would hail again,— He opes his swollen lips in vain. But look you! See! A lifted hand, And Vasques beckons his command. He cannot speak, he leans, and he Bends low upon his saddle-bow. And now his blade drops to his knee, And now he falters, now comes on, And now his head is bended low; And now his rein, his steel, is gone; Now faint as any child is he; And now his steed sinks to the knee. The sun hung molten in mid-space, Like some great star fix'd in its place. From out the gleaming spaces rose A sheen of gossamer and danced, As Morgan slow and still advanced Before his far-receding foes. Right on, and on, the still, black line Drove straight through gleaming sand and shine, By spar and beam and mast, and stray And waif of sea and cast-away. The far peaks faded from their sight, The mountain walls fell down like night, And nothing now was to be seen Except the dim sun hung in sheen Of gory garments all blood-red,— The hell beneath, the hell o'erhead. A black man tumbled from his steed. He clutch'd in death the moving sands, He caught the hot earth in his hands, He gripp'd it, held it hard and grim— The great, sad mother did not heed His hold, but pass'd right on from him. XVII The sun seem'd broken loose at last. And settled slowly to the west, Half-hidden as he fell to rest, Yet, like the flying Parthian, cast His keenest arrows as he pass'd. On, on, the black men slowly drew Their length like some great serpent through The sands, and left a hollow'd groove: They moved, they scarcely seem'd to move. How patient in their muffled tread! How like the dead march of the dead! At last the slow, black line was check'd, An instant only; now again It moved, it falter'd now, and now It settled in its sandy bed, And steeds stood rooted to the plain. Then all stood still, and men somehow Look'd down and with averted head; Look'd down, nor dared looked up, nor reck'd Of anything, of ill or good, But bow'd and stricken still, they stood. Like some brave band that dared the fierce And bristled steel of gather'd host, These daring men had dared to pierce This awful vastness, dead and gray. And now at last brought well at bay They stood,—but each stood to his post. Then one dismounted, waved a hand, 'Twas Morgan's stern and still command. There fell a clank, like loosen'd chain, As men dismounting loosed the rein. Then every steed stood loosed and free; And some stepp'd slow and mute aside, And some sank to the sands and died; And some stood still as shadows be. Old Morgan turn'd and raised his hand And laid it level with his eyes, And looked far back along the land. He saw a dark dust still uprise, Still surely tend to where he lay. He did not curse, he did not say— He did not even look surprise. Nay, he was over-gentle now; He wiped a time his Titan brow, Then sought dark Sybal in her place, Put out his arms, put down his face And look'd in hers. She reach'd her hands, She lean'd, she fell upon his breast; He reach'd his arms around; she lay As lies a bird in leafy nest. And he look'd out across the sands And bearing her, he strode away. Some black men settled down to rest, But none made murmur or request. The dead were dead, and that were best; The living, leaning, follow'd him, A long dark line, a shadow dim. The day through high mid-heaven rode Across the sky, the dim, red day; And on, the war-like day-god strode With shoulder'd shield away, away. The savage, war-like day bent low, As reapers bend in gathering grain, As archer bending bends yew bow, And flush'd and fretted as in pain. Then down his shoulder slid his shield, So huge, so awful, so blood-red And batter'd as from battle-field: It settled, sunk to his left hand, Sunk down and down, it touch'd the sand; Then day along the land lay dead, Without one candle, foot or head. And now the moon wheel'd white and vast, A round, unbroken, marbled moon, And touch'd the far, bright buttes of snow, Then climb'd their shoulders over soon; And there she seem'd to sit at last, To hang, to hover there, to grow, Grow grander than vast peaks of snow. She sat the battlements of time; She shone in mail of frost and rime A time, and then rose up and stood In heaven in sad widowhood. The faded moon fell wearily, And then the sun right suddenly Rose up full arm'd, and rushing came Across the land like flood of flame. And now it seemed that hills uprose, High push'd against the arching skies, As if to meet the sudden sun— Rose sharp from out the sultry dun, And seem'd to hold the free repose Of lands where flow'ry summits rise, In unfenced fields of Paradise. The black men look'd up from the sands Against the dim, uncertain skies, As men that disbelieved their eyes, And would have laugh'd; they wept instead, With shoulders heaved, with bowing head Hid down between the two black hands. They stood and gazed. Lo! like the call Of spring-time promises, the trees Lean'd from their lifted mountain wall, And stood clear cut against the skies, As if they grew in pistol-shot; Yet all the mountains answer'd not, And yet there came no cooling breeze, Nor soothing sense of wind-wet trees. At last old Morgan, looking through His shaded fingers, let them go, And let his load fall down as dead. He groan'd, he clutch'd his beard of snow As was his wont, then bowing low, Took up his life, and moaning said, “Lord Christ! 'tis the mirage, and we Stand blinded in a burning sea.” XVIII Again they move, but where or how It recks them little, nothing now. Yet Morgan leads them as before, But totters now; he bends, and he Is like a broken ship a-sea,— A ship that knows not any shore, Nor rudder, nor shall anchor more. Some leaning shadows crooning crept Through desolation, crown'd in dust. And had the mad pursuer kept His path, and cherish'd his pursuit? There lay no choice. Advance, he must: Advance, and eat his ashen fruit. Again the still moon rose and stood Above the dim, dark belt of wood, Above the buttes, above the snow, And bent a sad, sweet face below. She reach'd along the level plain Her long, white fingers. Then again She reach'd, she touch'd the snowy sands. Then reach'd far out until she touch'd A heap that lay with doubled hands, Reach'd from its sable self, and clutch'd With patient death. O tenderly That black, that dead and hollow face Was kiss'd that night. ... What if I say The long, white moonbeams reaching there, Caressing idle hands of clay, And resting on the wrinkled hair And great lips push'd in sullen pout, Were God's own fingers reaching out From heaven to that lonesome place? XIX By waif and stray and cast-away, Such as are seen in seas withdrawn, Old Morgan led in silence on; And sometimes lifting up his head, To guide his footsteps as he led, He deem'd he saw a great ship lay Her keel along the sea-wash'd sand, As with her captain's old command. The stars were seal'd; and then a haze Of gossamer fill'd all the west, So like in Indian summer days, And veil'd all things. And then the moon Grew pale and faint, and far. She died, And now nor star nor any sign Fell out of heaven. Oversoon A black man fell. Then at his side Some one sat down to watch, to rest— To rest, to watch, or what you will, The man sits resting, watching still. XX The day glared through the eastern rim Of rocky peaks, as prison bars, With light as dim as distant stars. The sultry sunbeams filter'd down Through misty phantoms weird and dim, Through shifting shapes bat-wing'd and brown. Like some vast ruin wrapp'd in flame The sun fell down before them now. Behind them wheel'd white peaks of snow, As they proceeded. Gray and grim And awful objects went and came Before them all. They pierced at last The desert's middle depths, and lo! There loom'd from out the desert vast A lonely ship, well-built and trim, And perfect all in hull and mast. No storm had stain'd it any whit, No seasons set their teeth in it. Her masts were white as ghosts, and tall; Her decks were as of yesterday. The rains, the elements, and all The moving things that bring decay By fair green lands or fairer seas, Had touch'd not here for centuries. Lo! date had lost all reckoning, And time had long forgotten all In this lost land, and no new thing Or old could anywise befall, For Time went by the other way. What dreams of gold or conquest drew The oak-built sea-king to these seas, Ere earth, old earth, unsatisfied, Rose up and shook man in disgust From off her wearied breast, and threw His high-built cities down, and dried These unnamed ship-sown seas to dust? Who trod these decks? What captain knew The straits that led to lands like these? Blew south-sea breeze or north-sea breeze? What spiced-winds whistled through this sail? What banners stream'd above these seas? And what strange seaman answer'd back To other sea-king's beck and hail, That blew across his foamy track? Sought Jason here the golden fleece? Came Trojan ship or ships of Greece? Came decks dark-mann'd from sultry Ind, Woo'd here by spacious wooing wind? So like a grand, sweet woman, when A great love moves her soul to men? Came here strong ships of Solomon In quest of Ophir by Cathay?. ... Sit down and dream of seas withdrawn, And every sea-breath drawn away. Sit down, sit down! What is the good That we go on still fashioning Great iron ships or walls of wood, High masts of oak, or anything? Lo! all things moving must go by. The seas lie dead. Behold, this land Sits desolate in dust beside His snow-white, seamless shroud of sand; The very clouds have wept and died, And only God is in the sky. XXI The sands lay heaved, as heaved by waves, As fashioned in a thousand graves: And wrecks of storm blown here and there, And dead men scatter'd everywhere; And strangely clad they seem'd to be Just as they sank in that dread sea. The mermaid with her golden hair Had clung about a wreck's beam there, And sung her song of sweet despair, The time she saw the seas withdrawn And all her pride and glory gone: Had sung her melancholy dirge Above the last receding surge, And, looking down the rippled tide, Had sung, and with her song had died. The monsters of the sea lay bound In strange contortions. Coil'd around A mast half heaved above the sand The great sea-serpent's folds were found, As solid as ship's iron band; And basking in the burning sun There rose the great whale's skeleton. A thousand sea things stretch'd across Their weary and bewilder'd way: Great unnamed monsters wrinkled lay With sunken eyes and shrunken form. The strong sea-horse that rode the storm With mane as light and white as floss, Lay tangled in his mane of moss. And anchor, hull, and cast-away, And all things that the miser deep Doth in his darkling locker keep, To right and left around them lay. Yea, golden coin and golden cup, And golden cruse, and golden plate, And all that great seas swallow up, Right in their dreadful pathway lay. The hoary sea made white with time, And wrinkled cross with many a crime, With all his treasured thefts lay there, His sins, his very soul laid bare, As if it were the Judgment Day. XXII And now the tawny night fell soon, And there was neither star nor moon; And yet it seem'd it was not night. There fell a phosphorescent light, There rose from white sands and dead men A soft light, white and strange as when The Spirit of Jehovah moved Upon the water's conscious face, And made it His abiding place. Remote, around the lonesome ship, Old Morgan moved, but knew it not, For neither star nor moon fell down. ... I trow that was a lonesome spot He found, where boat and ship did dip In sands like some half-sunken town. At last before the leader lay A form that in the night did seem A slain Goliath. As in a dream, He drew aside in his slow pace, And look'd. He saw a sable face! A friend that fell that very day, Thrown straight across his wearied way. He falter'd now. His iron heart, That never yet refused its part, Began to fail him; and his strength Shook at his knees, as shakes the wind A shatter'd ship. His shatter'd mind Ranged up and down the land. At length He turn'd, as ships turn, tempest toss'd, For now he knew that he was lost! He sought in vain the moon, the stars, In vain the battle-star of Mars. Again he moved. And now again He paused, he peer'd along the plain, Another form before him lay. He stood, and statue-white he stood, He trembled like a stormy wood,— It was a foeman brawn and gray. He lifted up his head again, Again he search'd the great profound For moon, for star, but sought in vain. He kept his circle round and round The great ship lifting from the sand, And pointing heavenward like a hand. And still he crept along the plain, Yet where his foeman dead again Lay in his way he moved around, And soft as if on sacred ground, And did not touch him anywhere. It might have been he had a dread, In his half-crazed and fever'd brain, His fallen foe might rise again If he should dare to touch him there. He circled round the lonesome ship Like some wild beast within a wall, That keeps his paces round and round The very stillness had a sound; He saw strange somethings rise and dip; He felt the weirdness like a pall Come down and cover him. It seem'd To take a form, take many forms, To talk to him, to reach out arms; Yet on he kept, and silent kept, And as he lead he lean'd and slept, And as he slept he talk'd and dream'd. Two shadows follow'd, stopp'd, and stood Bewilder'd, wander'd back again, Came on and then fell to the sand, And sinking died. Then other men Did wag their woolly heads and laugh, Then bend their necks and seem to quaff Of cooling waves that careless flow Where woods and long, strong grasses grow. Yet on wound Morgan, leaning low, With her upon his breast, and slow As hand upon a dial plate. He did not turn his course or quail, He did not falter, did not fail, Turn right or left or hesitate. Some far-off sounds had lost their way, And seem'd to call to him and pray For help, as if they were affright. It was not day, it seem'd not night, But that dim land that lies between The mournful, faithful face of night, And loud and gold-bedazzled day; A night that was not felt but seen. There seem'd not now the ghost of sound, He stepp'd as soft as step the dead; Yet on he lead in solemn tread, Bewilder'd, blinded, round and round, About the great black ship that rose Tall-masted as that ship that blows Her ghost below lost Panama,— The tallest mast man ever saw. Two leaning shadows follow'd him: Their eyes were red, their teeth shone white, Their limbs did lift as shadows swim. Then one went left and one went right, And in the night pass'd out of sight; Pass'd through the portals black, unknown, And Morgan totter'd on alone. And why he still survived the rest, Why still he had the strength to stir, Why still he stood like gnarlèd oak That buffets storm and tempest stroke, One cannot say, save but for her, That helpless being on his breast. She did not speak, she did not stir; In rippled currents over her, Her black, abundant hair pour'd down Like mantle or some sable gown. That sad, sweet dreamer; she who knew Not anything of earth at all, Nor cared to know its bane or bliss; That dove that did not touch the land, That knew, yet did not understand. And this may be because she drew Her all of life right from the hand Of God, and did not choose to learn The things that make up man's concern. Ah! there be souls none understand; Like clouds, they cannot touch the land. Unanchored ships, they blow and blow, Sail to and fro, and then go down In unknown seas that none shall know, Without one ripple of renown. Call these not fools; the test of worth Is not the hold you have of earth. Ay, there be gentlest souls sea-blown That know not any harbor known. Now it may be the reason is, They touch on fairer shores than this. At last he touch'd a fallen group, Dead fellows tumbled in the sands, Dead foemen, gather'd to their dead. And eager now the man did stoop, Lay down his load and reach his hands, And stretch his form and look steadfast And frightful, and as one aghast. He lean'd, and then he raised his head, And look'd for Vasques, but in vain He peer'd along the deadly plain. Now, from the night another face The last that follow'd through the deep, Comes on, falls dead within a pace. Yet Vasques still survives! But where? His last bold follower lies there, Thrown straight across old Morgan's track, As if to check him, bid him back. He stands, he does not dare to stir, He watches by his charge asleep, He fears for her: but only her. The man who ever mock'd at death, He only dares to draw his breath. XXIII Beyond, and still as black despair, A man rose up, stood dark and tall, Stretch'd out his neck, reach'd forth, let fall Dark oaths, and Death stood waiting there. A tawny dead man stretch'd between, And Vasques set his foot thereon. The stars were seal'd, the moon was gone, The very darkness cast a shade. The scene was rather heard than seen, The rattle of a single blade. ... A right foot rested on the dead, A black hand reach'd and clutch'd a beard, Then neither pray'd, nor dream'd of hope. A fierce face reach'd, a black face peer'd ... No bat went whirling overhead, No star fell out of Ethiope. The dead man lay between them there, The two men glared as tigers glare,— The black man held him by the beard. He wound his hand, he held him fast, And tighter held, as if he fear'd The man might 'scape him at the last. Whiles Morgan did not speak or stir, But stood in silent watch with her. Not long. ... A light blade lifted, thrust, A blade that leapt and swept about, So wizard-like, like wand in spell, So like a serpent's tongue thrust out. ... Thrust twice, thrust thrice, thrust as he fell, Thrust through until it touched the dust. Yet ever as he thrust and smote, A black hand like an iron band Did tighten round a gasping throat. He fell, but did not loose his hand; The two lay dead upon the sand. Lo! up and from the fallen forms Two ghosts came, dark as gathered storms; Two gray ghosts stood, then looking back; With hands all empty, and hands clutch'd, Strode on in silence. Then they touch'd, Along the lonesome, chartless track, Where dim Plutonian darkness fell, Then touch'd the outer rim of hell; And looking back their great despair Sat sadly down, as resting there. XXIV As if there was a strength in death The battle seem'd to nerve the man To superhuman strength. He rose, Held up his head, began to scan The heavens and to take his breath Right strong and lustily. He now Resumed his part, and with his eye Fix'd on a star that filter'd through The farther west, push'd bare his brow, And kept his course with head held high, As if he strode his deck and drew His keel below some lofty light That watch'd the rocky reef at night. How lone he was, how patient she Upon that lonesome sandy sea! It were a sad, unpleasant sight To follow them through all the night, Until the time they lifted hand, And touch'd at last a water'd land. The turkeys walk'd the tangled grass, And scarcely turn'd to let them pass. There was no sign of man, nor sign Of savage beast. 'Twas so divine, It seem'd as if the bended skies Were rounded for this Paradise. The large-eyed antelope came down From off their windy hills, and blew Their whistles as they wander'd through The open groves of water'd wood; They came as light as if on wing, And reached their noses wet and brown And stamp'd their little feet and stood Close up before them, wondering. What if this were that Eden old, They found in this heart of the new And unnamed westmost world of gold, Where date and history had birth, And man began first wandering To go the girdle of the earth, And find the beautiful and true? It lies a little isle mid land, An island in a sea of sand; With reedy waters and the balm Of an eternal summer air; Some blowy pines toss here and there; And there are grasses long and strong, And tropic fruits that never fail: The Manzanita pulp, the palm, The prickly pear, with all the song Of summer birds. And there the quail Makes nest, and you may hear her call All day from out the chaparral. A land where white man never trod, And Morgan seems some demi-god, That haunts the red man's spirit land. A land where never red man's hand Is lifted up in strife at all, But holds it sacred unto those Who bravely fell before their foes, And rarely dares its desert wall. Here breaks nor sound of strife nor sign; Rare times a chieftain comes this way, Alone, and battle-scarr'd and gray, And then he bends devout before The maid who keeps the cabin-door, And deems her something all divine. Within the island's heart 'tis said, Tall trees are bending down with bread, And that a fountain pure as Truth, And deep and mossy-bound and fair, Is bubbling from the forest there,— Perchance the fabled fount of youth! An isle where skies are ever fair, Where men keep never date nor day, Where Time has thrown his glass away. This isle is all their own. No more The flight by day, the watch by night. Dark Sybal twines about the door The scarlet blooms, the blossoms white And winds red berries in her hair, And never knows the name of care. She has a thousand birds; they blow In rainbow clouds, in clouds of snow; The birds take berries from her hand; They come and go at her command. She has a thousand pretty birds, That sing her summer songs all day; Small, black-hoof'd antelope in herds, And squirrels bushy-tail'd and gray, With round and sparkling eyes of pink, And cunning-faced as you can think. She has a thousand busy birds: And is she happy in her isle, With all her feather'd friends and herds? For when has Morgan seen her smile? She has a thousand cunning birds, They would build nestings in her hair, She has brown antelope in herds; She never knows the name of care; Why, then, is she not happy there? All patiently she bears her part; She has a thousand birdlings there, These birds they would build in her hair; But not one bird builds in her heart. She has a thousand birds; yet she Would give ten thousand cheerfully, All bright of plume and clear of tongue, And sweet as ever trilled or sung, For one small flutter'd bird to come And build within her heart, though dumb. She has a thousand birds; yet one Is lost, and, lo! she is undone. She sighs sometimes. She looks away, And yet she does not weep or say. “The Ship in the Desert” was first published in London—Chapman and Hall, 1876. It was nearly twice its present length and was dedicated To my Parents in Oregon, as follows: With deep reverence I inscribe these lines, my dear parents, to you. I see you now, away beyond the seas—beyond the lands where the sun goes down in the Pacific like some great ship of fire, resting still on the green hills, waiting “Where rolls the Oregon And hears no sound save its own dashing.” Nearly a quarter of a century ago you took me the long and lonesome half-year's journey across the mighty continent, wild and rent and broken up and sown with sand and ashes and crossed by tumbling wooded rivers that ran as if glad to get away, fresh and strange and new, as if but half-fashioned from the hand of God. All the time as I tread this strange land I re-live those scenes, and you are with me. How dark and deep, how sullen, strong and lionlike the mighty Missouri rolled between his walls of untracked wood and cleft the unknown domain of the middle world before us! Then the frail and buffeted rafts on the river, the women and children huddled together, the shouts of the brawny men as they swam with the bellowing cattle, the cows in the stormy stream eddying, whirling, spinning about, calling to their young, their bright horns shining in the sun. The wild men waiting on the other side; painted savages, leaning on their bows, despising our weakness, opening a way, letting us pass on to the unknown distances, where they said the sun and moon lay down together and brought forth the stars. The long and winding lines of wagons, the graves by the wayside, the women weeping together as they passed on. Then hills, then plains, parched lands like Syria, dust and alkali, cold streams with woods, camps by night, great wood fires in circles, tents in the center like Cæsar's battle camps, painted men that passed like shadows, showers of arrows, the wild beasts howling from the hills. You, my dear parents, will pardon the thread of fiction on which I have strung these scenes and descriptions of a mighty land of mystery, and wild and savage grandeur, for the world will have its way, and, like a spoiled child, demands a tale— “Yea, We who toil and earn our bread, still have our masters.” A ragged and broken story it is, with long deserts, with alkali and ashes, yet it may, like the land it deals of, have some green places, and woods and running waters, where you can rest. Three times now I have ranged the great West in fancy, as I did in fact for twenty years and gathered unknown and unnamed blossoms from mountain top, from desert land, where man never ranged before, and asked the West to receive my weeds, my grasses and blue-eyed blossoms. But here it ends. Good or bad, I have done enough of this work on the border. The Orient promises a more grateful harvest. I have been true to my West. She has been my only love. I have remembered her greatness. I have done my work to show to the world her vastness, her riches, her resources, her valor and her dignity, her poetry and her grandeur. Yet while I was going on working so in silence, what were the things she said of me? But let that pass, my dear parents. Others will come after us. Possibly I have blazed out the trail for great minds over this field, as you did across the deserts and plains for great men a quarter of a century ago. Joaquin Miller. Lake Como, Italy. I had bought land near Naples, where I wrote most of this, along with a young Englishman intending to settle down there; but we both were stricken with malarial fever; he died, and I, broken and sick at heart for my mountains, finally came home. The author of Cleopatra, a man of great and varied endowments, laid a strong hand to the fashioning of this poem, and in return I made mention of his Sybals and Semiramis. We knew, in Rome, and loved much the woman herein described. In truth, I never created any one of my men or women or scenes entirely. As for the story of the ship in the desert, it is old, old. You can see the tide marks of an ocean even from your car window as you glide around Salt Lake, hundreds of feet up the steeps. The mighty Colorado Cañon was made by the breaking away of this ocean, you find oyster shells and petrified salt water fish in the Rocky Mountains, and a ship in the desert is quite in line with these facts. The body of this poem was first published in the Atlantic Monthly. The purpose of it was the same as induced the Isles of the Amazons, but the work is better because more true and nearer to the heart. Bear in mind it was done when the heart of the continent was indeed a desert, or at least a wilderness. How much or how little it may have had to do in bringing Europe this way to seek for the lost Edens, and to make the desert blossom as the rose, matters nothing now; but, “He hath brought many captives home to Rome whose ransom did the generous coffers fill.” ISLES OF THE AMAZONS Part I Primeval forests! virgin sod! That Saxon has not ravish'd yet, Lo! peak on peak in stairways set— In stepping stairs that reach to God! Here we are free as sea or wind, For here are set Time's snowy tents In everlasting battlements Against the march of Saxon mind. Far up in the hush of the Amazon River, And mantled and hung in the tropical trees, There are isles as grand as the isles of seas. And the waves strike strophes, and keen reeds quiver, As the sudden canoe shoots past them and over The strong, still tide to the opposite shore, Where the blue-eyed men by the sycamore Sit mending their nets 'neath the vine-twined cover; Sit weaving the threads of long, strong grasses; They wind and they spin on the clumsy wheel, Into hammocks red-hued with the cochineal, To trade with the single black ship that passes, With foreign old freightage of curious old store, And still and slow as if half asleep,— A cunning old trader that loves to creep Cautious and slow in the shade of the shore. And the blue-eyed men that are mild as the dawns— Oh, delicate dawns of the grand Andes! Lift up soft eyes that are deep like seas, And mild yet wild as the red-white fawns'; And they gaze into yours, then weave, then listen, Then look in wonder, then again weave on, Then again look wonder that your are not gone, While the keen reeds quiver and the bent waves glisten; But they say no word while they weave and wonder, Though they sometimes sing, voiced low like the dove, And as deep and as rich as their tropical love, A-weaving their net threads through and under. A pure, true people you may trust are these That weave their threads where the quick leaves quiver; And this is their tale of the Isles of the river, And the why that their eyes are so blue like seas: The why that the men draw water and bear The wine or the water in the wild boar skin, And do hew the wood and weave and spin, And so bear with the women full burthen and share. A curious old tale of a curious old time, That is told you betimes by a quaint old crone, Who sits on the rim of an island alone, As ever was told you in story or rhyme. Her brown, bare feet dip down to the river, And dabble and plash to her monotone, As she holds in her hands a strange green stone, And talks to the boat where the bent reeds quiver. And the quaint old crone has a singular way Of holding her head to the side and askew, And smoothing the stone in her palms all day As saying “I've nothing at all for you,” Until you have anointed her palm, and you Have touched on the delicate spring of a door That silver has opened perhaps before; For woman is woman the wide world through. The old near truth on the far new shore, I bought and I paid for it; so did you; The tale may be false or the tale may be true; I give it as I got it, and who can more? If I have made journeys to difficult shores, And woven delusions in innocent verse, If none be the wiser, why, who is the worse? The field it was mine, the fruit it is yours. A sudden told tale. You may read as you run. A part of it hers, some part is my own, Crude, and too carelessly woven and sown, As I sail'd on the Mexican seas in the sun. 'Twas nations ago, when the Amazons were, That a fair young knight—says the quaint old crone, With her head sidewise, as she smooths at the stone— Came over the seas, with his golden hair, And a great black steed, and glittering spurs, With a woman's face, with a manly frown, A heart as tender and as true as hers, And a sword that had come from crusaders down. And fairest, and foremost in love as in war Was the brave young knight of the brave old days. Of all the knights, with their knightly ways, That had journey'd away to this world afar In the name of Spain; of the splendid few Who bore her banner in the new-born world, From the sea rim up to where clouds are curl'd, And condors beat with black wings the blue. He was born, says the crone, where the brave are fair, And blown from the banks of the Guadal-quiver, And yet blue-eyed, with the Celt's soft hair, With never a drop of the dark deep river Of Moorish blood that had swept through Spain, And plash'd the world with its tawny stain. He sat on his steed, and his sword was bloody With heathen blood: the battle was done; His heart rebelled and rose with pity. For crown'd with fire, wreathed and ruddy Fell antique temples built up to the sun. Below on the plain lay the burning city At the conqueror's feet; the red street strown With dead, with gold, and with gods overthrown. And the heathen pour'd, in a helpless flood, With never a wail and with never a blow, At last, to even provoke a foe, Through gateways, wet with the pagan's blood. “Ho, forward! smite!” but the minstrel linger'd, He reach'd his hand and he touch'd the rein, He humm'd an air, and he toy'd and finger'd The arching neck and the glossy mane. He rested the heel, he rested the hand, Though the thing was death to the man to dare To doubt, to question, to falter there, Nor heeded at all to the hot command. He wiped his steel on his black steed's mane, He sheathed it deep, then look'd at the sun, Then counted his comrades, one by one, With booty returning from the plunder'd plain. He lifted his face to the flashing snow, He lifted his shield of steel as he sang, And he flung it away till it clang'd and rang On the granite rocks in the plain below. He cross'd his bosom. Made overbold, He lifted his voice and sang, quite low At first, then loud in the long ago, When the loves endured though the days grew old. They heard his song, the chief on the plain Stood up in his stirrups, and, sword in hand, He cursed and he call'd with a loud command To the blue-eyed boy to return again; To lift his shield again to the sky, And come and surrender his sword or die. He wove his hand in the stormy mane, He lean'd him forward, he lifted the rein, He struck the flank, he wheel'd and sprang, And gaily rode in the face of the sun, And bared his sword and he bravely sang, “Ho! come and take it!” but there came not one. And so he sang with his face to the south: “I shall go; I shall search for the Amazon shore, Where the curses of man they are heard no more, And kisses alone shall embrace the mouth. “I shall journey in search of the Incan Isles, Go far and away to traditional land, Where love is queen in a crown of smiles, And battle has never imbrued a hand; “Where man has never despoil'd or trod; Where woman's hand with a woman's heart Has fashion'd an Eden from man apart, And walks in her garden alone with God. “I shall find that Eden, and all my years Shall sit and repose, shall sing in the sun; And the tides may rest or the tides may run, And men may water the world with tears; “And the years may come and the years may go, And men make war, may slay and be slain, But I not care, for I never shall know Of man, or of aught that is man's again. “The waves may battle, the winds may blow, The mellow rich moons may ripen and fall, The seasons of gold they may gather or go, The mono may chatter, the paroquet call, And I shall not heed, take note, or know, If the Fates befriend, or if ill befall, Of worlds without or of worlds at all, Of heaven above, or of hadès below.” 'Twas the song of a dream and the dream of a singer, Drawn fine as the delicate fibers of gold, And broken in two by the touch of a finger, And blown as the winds blow, rent and roll'd In dust, and spent as a tale that is told. Alas! for his dreams and the songs he sung; The beasts beset him; the serpents they hung, Red-tongued and terrible, over his head. He clove and he thrust with his keen, quick steel, He coax'd with his hand, he urged with his heel, Till his steel was broken, and his steed lay dead. He toil'd to the river, he lean'd intent To the wave, and away to the islands fair, From beasts that pursued, and he breathed a prayer; For soul and body were well-nigh spent. 'Twas the king of rivers, and the Isles were near; Yet it moved so strange, so still, so strong, It gave no sound, not even the song Of a sea-bird screaming defiance or fear. It was dark and dreadful! Wide like an ocean, Much like a river but more like a sea, Save that there was naught of the turbulent motion Of tides, or of winds blown abaft, or alee. Yea, strangely strong was the wave and slow, And half-way hid in the dark, deep tide, Great turtles, they paddled them to and fro, And away to the Isles and the opposite side. The nude black boar through abundant grass Stole down to the water and buried his nose, And crunch'd white teeth till the bubbles rose As white and as bright as are globes of glass. Yea, steadily moved it, mile upon mile, Above and below and as still as the air; The bank made slippery here and there By the slushing slide of the crocodile. The great trees bent to the tide like slaves; They dipp'd their boughs as the stream swept on, And then drew back, then dipp'd and were gone Away to the sea with the resolute waves. The land was the tide's; the shore was undone; It look'd as the lawless, unsatisfied seas Had thrust up an arm through the tangle of trees, And clutched at the citrons that grew in the sun; And clutch'd at the diamonds that hid in the sand, And laid heavy hand on the gold, and a hand On the redolent fruits, on the ruby-like wine, On the stones like the stars when the stars are divine; Had thrust through the rocks of the ribb'd Andes; Had wrested and fled; and had left a waste And a wide way strewn in precipitate haste, As he bore them away to the buccaneer seas. Oh heavens, the eloquent song of the silence! Asleep lay the sun in the vines, on the sod. And asleep in the sun lay the green-girdled islands, As rock'd to their rest in the cradle of God. God's poet is silence! His song is unspoken, And yet so profound, so loud, and so far, It fills you, it thrills you with measures unbroken, And as still, and as fair, and as far as a star. The shallow seas moan. From the first they have mutter'd, As a child that is fretted, and weeps at its will ... The poems of God are too grand to be utter'd: The dreadful deep seas they are loudest when still. “I shall fold my hands, for this is the river Of death,” he said, “and the sea-green isle Is an Eden set by the Gracious Giver Wherein to rest.” He listened the while Then lifted his head, then lifted a hand Arch'd over his brow, and he lean'd and listen'd,— 'Twas only a bird on a border of sand,— The dark stream eddied and gleam'd and glisten'd, And the martial notes from the isle were gone, Gone as a dream dies out with the dawn. 'Twas only a bird on a border of sand, Slow piping, and diving it here and there, Slim, gray, and shadowy, light as the air, That dipp'd below from a point of the land. “Unto God a prayer and to love a tear, And I die,” he said, “in a desert here, So deep that never a note is heard But the listless song of that soulless bird. “The strong trees lean in their love unto trees, Lock arms in their loves, and are so made strong, Stronger than armies; aye, stronger than seas That rush from their caves in a storm of song. “A miser of old, his last great treasure Flung far in the sea, and he fell and he died; And so shall I give, O terrible tide, To you my song and my last sad measure.” He blew on a reed by the still, strong river, Blew low at first, like a dream, then long, Then loud, then loud as the keys that quiver, And fret and toss with their freight of song. He sang and he sang with a resolute will, Till the mono rested above on his haunches, And held his head to the side and was still,— Till a bird blown out of the night of branches Sang sadder than love, so sweeter than sad, Till the boughs did burthen and the reeds did fill With beautiful birds, and the boy was glad. Our loves they are told by the myriad-eyed stars, And love it is grand in a reasonable way, And fame it is good in its way for a day, Borne dusty from books and bloody from wars; And death, I say, is an absolute need, And a calm delight, and an ultimate good; But a song that is blown from a watery reed By a soundless deep from a boundless wood, With never a hearer to heed or to prize But God and the birds and the hairy wild beasts, Is sweeter than love, than fame, or than feasts, Or any thing else that is under the skies. The quick leaves quiver'd, and the sunlight danced; As he boy sang sweet, and the birds said, “Sweet;” And the tiger crept close, and lay low at his feet, And he sheathed his claws as he listened entranced. The serpent that hung from the sycamore bough, And sway'd his head in a crescent above, Had folded his neck to the white limb now, And fondled it close like a great black love. But the hands grew weary, the heart wax'd faint, The loud notes fell to a far-off plaint, The sweet birds echo'd no more, “Oh, sweet,” The tiger arose and unsheathed his claws, The serpent extended his iron jaws, And the frail reed shiver'd and fell at his feet. A sound on the tide! and he turn'd and cried, “Oh, give God thanks, for they come, they come!” He look'd out afar on the opaline tide, Then clasp'd his hands, and his lips were dumb. A sweeping swift crescent of sudden canoes! As light as the sun of the south and as soon, And true and as still as a sweet half-moon That leans from the heavens, and loves and woos! The Amazons came in their martial pride, As full on the stream as a studding of stars, All girded in armor as girded in wars, In foamy white furrows dividing the tide. With a face as brown as the boatmen's are, Or the brave, brown hand of a harvester; The Queen on a prow stood splendid and tall, As the petulent waters did lift and fall; Stood forth for the song, half lean'd in surprise, Stood fair to behold, and yet grand to behold, And austere in her face, and saturnine-soul'd, And sad and subdued, in her eloquent eyes. And sad were they all; yet tall and serene Of presence, but silent, and brow'd severe; As for some things lost, or for some fair, green, And beautiful place, to the memory dear. “O Mother of God! Thrice merciful saint! I am saved!” he said, and he wept outright; Ay, wept as even a woman might, For the soul was full and the heart was faint. “Stay! stay!” cried the Queen, and she leapt to the land, And she lifted her hand, and she lowered their spears, “A woman! a woman! ho! help! give a hand! A woman! a woman! I know by the tears.” Then gently as touch of the truest of woman, They lifted him up from the earth where he fell, And into the boat, with a half hidden swell Of the heart that was holy and tenderly human. They spoke low-voiced as a vesper prayer; They pillow'd his head as only the hand Of woman can pillow, and push'd from the land, And the Queen she sat threading the gold of his hair. PART II. Forsake those People. What are they That laugh, that live, that love by rule? Forsake the Saxon. Who are these That shun the shadows of the trees; The perfumed forests? ... Go thy way, We are not one. I will not please You:—fare you well, O wiser fool! But ye who love me:—Ye who love The shaggy forests, fierce delights Of sounding waterfalls, of heights That hang like broken moons above, With brows of pine that brush the sun, Believe and follow. We are one: The wild man shall to us be tame, The woods shall yield their mysteries; The stars shall answer to a name, And be as birds above the trees. They swept to their Isles through the furrows of foam; They alit on the land, as love hastening home, And below the banana, with leaf like a tent, They tenderly laid him, they bade him take rest, They brought him strange fishes and fruits of the best, And he ate and took rest with a patient content. They watched so well that he rose up strong, And stood in their midst, and they said, “How fair!” And they said, “How tall!” And they toy'd with his hair. And they touched his limbs and they said, “How long And how strong they are; and how brave she is, That she made her way through the wiles of man, That she braved his wrath that she broke the ban Of his desolate life for the love of this!” They wrought for him armor and cunning attire, They brought him a sword and a great shell shield, And implored him to shiver the lance on the field, And to follow their beautiful Queen in her ire. But he took him apart; then the Amazons came And entreated of him with their eloquent eyes And their earnest and passionate souls of flame, And the soft, sweet words that are broken of sighs, To be one of their own, but he still denied And bow'd and abash'd he stole further aside. He stood by the Palms and he lean'd in unrest, And standing alone, looked out and afar, For his own fair land where the castles are, With irresolute arms on a restless breast. He re-lived his loves, he recall'd his wars, He gazed and he gazed with a soul distress'd, Like a far sweet star that is lost in the west, Till the day was broken to a dust of stars. They sigh'd, and they left him alone in the care Of faithfullest matron; they moved to the field With the lifted sword and the sounding shield High fretting magnificent storms of hair. And, true as the moon in her march of stars, The Queen stood forth in her fierce attire Worn as they trained or worn in the wars, As bright and as chaste as a flash of fire. With girdles of gold and of silver cross'd, And plaited, and chased, and bound together, Broader and stronger than belts of leather, Cunningly fashion'd and blazon'd and boss'd— With diamonds circling her, stone upon stone, Above the breast where the borders fail, Below the breast where the fringes zone, She moved in a glittering garment of mail. The form made hardy and the waist made spare From athlete sports and adventures bold, The breastplate; fasten'd with clasps of gold, Was clasp'd, as close as the breasts could bear,— And bound and drawn to a delicate span, It flash'd in the red front ranks of the field— Was fashion'd full trim in its intricate plan And gleam'd as a sign, as well as a shield, That the virgin Queen was unyielding still, And pure as the tides that around her ran; True to her trust, and strong in her will Of war, and hatred to the touch of man. The field it was theirs in storm or in shine, So fairly they stood that the foe came not To battle again, and the fair forgot The rage of battle; and they trimm'd the vine, They tended the fields of the tall green corn, They crush'd the grape and they drew the wine In the great round gourds and the bended horn— And they lived as the gods in the days divine. They bathed in the wave in the amber morn, They took repose in the peaceful shade Of eternal palms, and were never afraid; Yet oft did they sigh, and look far and forlorn. Where the rim of the wave was weaving a spell, And the grass grew soft where it hid from the sun, Would the Amazons gather them every one At the call of the Queen or the sound of her shell: Would come in strides through the kingly trees, And train and marshal them brave and well In the golden noon, in the hush of peace Where the shifting shades of the fan-palms fell; Would train till flush'd and as warm as wine: Would reach with their limbs, would thrust with the lance, Attack, retire, retreat and advance, Then wheel in column, then fall in line; Stand thigh and thigh with the limbs made hard And rich and round as the swift limb'd pard, Or a racer train'd, or a white bull caught In the lasso's toils, where the tame are not: Would curve as the waves curve, swerve in line; Would dash through the trees, would train with the bow, Then back to the lines, now sudden, then slow, Then flash their swords in the sun at a sign: Would settle the foot right firmly afront, Then sound the shield till the sound was heard Afar, as the horn in the black boar hunt; Yet, strangest of all, say never one word. When shadows fell far from the westward, and when The sun had kiss'd hands and set forth for the east, They would kindle campfires and gather them then, Well-worn and most merry with song, to the feast. They sang of all things, but the one, sacred one, That could make them most glad, as they lifted the gourd And pass'd it around, with its rich purple hoard, From the island that lay with its face to the sun. Though lips were most luscious, and eyes as divine As the eyes of the skies that bend down from above; Though hearts were made glad and most mellow with love, As dripping gourds drain'd of their burthens of wine; Though brimming, and dripping, and bent of their shape Were the generous gourds from the juice of the grape, They could sing not of love, they could breathe not a thought Of the savor of life; of love sought, or unsought. Their loves they were not; they had banished the name Of man, and the uttermost mention of love,— The moonbeams about them, the quick stars above, The mellow-voiced waves, they were ever the same, In sign, and in saying, of the old true lies; But they took no heed; no answering sign, Save glances averted and half-hush'd sighs, Went back from the breasts with their loves divine. Then sang of free life with a will, and well, They had paid for it well when the price was blood; They beat on the shield, and they blew on the shell, When their wars were not, for they held it good To be glad, and to sing till the flush of the day, In an annual feast, when the broad leaves fell; Yet some sang not, and some sighed, “Ah, well!”— For there's far less left you to sing or to say, When mettlesome love is banish'd, I ween— To hint at as hidden, or to half disclose In the swift sword-cuts of the tongue, made keen With wine at a feast,—than one would suppose. So the days wore by, but they brought no rest To the minstrel knight, though the sun was as gold, And the Isles were green, and the great Queen blest In the splendor of arms, and as pure as bold. He would now resolve to reveal to her all, His sex and his race in a well-timed song; And his love of peace, his hatred of wrong, And his own deceit, though the sun should fall. Then again he would linger, and knew not how He could best proceed, and deferr'd him now Till a favorite day, when the fair day came, And still he delay'd, and reproached him the same. And he still said nought, but, subduing his head He wander'd one day in a dubious spell Of unutterable thought of the truth unsaid, To the indolent shore, and he gather'd a shell, And he shaped its point to his passionate mouth, And he turn'd to a bank and began to blow, While the Amazons trained in a troop below— Blew soft and sweet as a kiss of the south. The Amazons lifted with glad surprise, Stood splendid and glad and look'd far and fair, Set forward a foot, and shook back their hair, Like clouds push'd back from the sun-lit skies. It stirr'd their souls, and they ceased to train In troop by the shore, as the tremulous strain Fell down from the hill through the tasselling trees; And a murmur of song, like the sound of bees In the clover crown of a queenly spring, Came back unto him, and he laid the shell Aside on the bank, and began to sing Of eloquent love; and the ancient spell Of passionate song was his, and the Isle, As waked to delight from its slumber long, Came back in echoes; yet all this while He knew not at all the sin of his song. PART III Come, lovers, come, forget your pains! I know upon this earth a spot Where clinking coins, that clank as chains, Upon the souls of men, are not; Nor man is measured for his gains Of gold that stream with crimson stains. There snow-topp'd towers crush the clouds And break the still abode of stars, Like sudden ghosts in snowy shrouds, New broken through their earthly bars, And condors whet their crooked beaks On lofty limits of the peaks. O men fret as frets the main! You irk me with your eager gaze Down in the earth for fat increase— Eternal talks of gold and gain, Your shallow wit, your shallow ways, And breaks my soul across the shoal As breakers break on shallow seas. They bared their brows to the palms above, But some look'd level into comrades' eyes, And they then remember'd that the thought of love Was the thing forbidden, and they sank in sighs. They turned from the training, to heed in throng To the old, old tale; and they trained no more, As he sang of love; and some on the shore, And full in the sound of the eloquent song, With womanly air and an irresolute will Went listlessly onward as gathering shells; Then gazed in the waters, as bound by spells; Then turned to the song and so sigh'd, and were still. And they said no word. Some tapp'd on the sand With the sandal'd foot, keeping time to the sound, In a sort of dream; some timed with the hand, And one held eyes full of tears to the ground. She thought of the days when their wars they were not, As she lean'd and listened to the old, old song, When they sang of their loves, and she well forgot Man's hard oppressions and a world of wrong. Like a pure true woman, with her trust in tears And the things that are true, she relieved them in thought, Though hush'd and crush'd in the fall of the years; She lived but the fair, and the false she forgot. As a tale long told, or as things that are dreams The quivering curve of the lip it confest The silent regrets, and the soul that teems With a world of love in a brave true breast. Then this one, younger, who had known no love, Nor look'd upon man but in blood on the field, She bow'd her head, and she leaned on her shield, And her heart beat quick as the wings of a dove That is blown from the sea, where the rests are not In the time of storms; and by instinct taught Grew pensive, and sigh'd; as she thought and she thought Of some wonderful things, and—she knew not of what. Then this one thought of a love forsaken, She thought of a brown sweet babe, and she thought Of the bread-fruits gather'd, of the swift fish taken In intricate nets, like a love well sought. She thought of the moons of her maiden dawn, Mellow'd and fair with the forms of man; So dearer indeed to dwell upon Than the beautiful waves that around her ran: So fairer indeed than the fringes of light That lie at rest on the west of the sea In furrows of foam on the borders of night, And dearer indeed than the songs to be— Than calling of dreams from the opposite land, To the land of life, and of journeys dreary, When the soul goes over from the form grown weary, And walks in the cool of the trees on the sand. But the Queen was enraged and would smite him at first With the sword unto death, yet it seemed that she durst Not touch him at all; and she moved as to chide, And she lifted her face, and she frown'd at his side, Then she touch'd on his arm; then she looked in his eyes And right full in his soul, but she saw no fear, In the pale fair face, and with frown severe She press'd her lips as suppressing her sighs. She banish'd her wrath, she unbended her face, She lifted her hand and put back his hair From his fair sad brow, with a penitent air, And forgave him all with unuttered grace. But she said no word, yet no more was severe; She stood as subdued by the side of him still, Then averted her face with a resolute will, As to hush a regret, or to hide back a tear. She sighed to herself: “A stranger is this, And ill and alone, that knows not at all That a throne shall totter and the strong shall fall, At the mention of love and its banefullest bliss. “O life that is lost in bewildering love— But a stranger is sacred!” She lifted a hand And she laid it as soft as the breast of a dove On the minstrel's mouth. It was more than the wand Of the tamer of serpents, for she did no more Than to bid with here eyes and to beck with her hand, And the song drew away to the waves of the shore; Took wings, as it were, to the verge of the land. But her heart was oppress'd. With penitent head She turned to her troop, and retiring, she said: “Alas! and alas! shall it come to pass That the panther shall die from a blade of grass? That the tiger shall yield at the bent-horn's blast? That we, who have conquer'd a world and all Of men and of beasts in the world must fall Ourselves at the mention of love at last?” The tall Queen turn'd with her troop; She led minstrel and all to the innermost part Of the palm-crowned Isle, where great trees group In armies, to battle when black-storms start, And made a retreat from the sun by the trees That are topp'd like tents, where the fire-flies Are a light to the feet, and a fair lake lies, As cool as the coral-set center of seas. The palm-trees lorded the copse like kings, Their tall tops tossing the indolent clouds That folded the Isle in the dawn, like shrouds, Then fled from the sun like to living things. The cockatoo swung in the vines below, And muttering hung on a golden thread, Or moved on the moss'd bough to and fro, In plumes of gold and array'd in red. The lake lay hidden away from the light, As asleep in the Isle from the tropical noon, And narrow and bent like a new-born moon, And fair as a moon in the noon of the night. 'Twas shadow'd by forests, and fringed by ferns, And fretted anon by red fishes that leapt At indolent flies that slept or kept Their drowsy tones on the tide by turns. And here in the dawn when the Day was strong And newly aroused from leafy repose, With dews on his feet and tints of the rose In his great flush'd face was a sense of song That the tame old world has not known or heard. The soul was filled with the soft perfumes, The eloquent wings of the humming bird Beguiled the heart, they purpled the air And allured the eye, as so everywhere On the rim of the wave or across it in swings, They swept or they sank in a sea of blooms, And wove and wound in a song of wings. A bird in scarlet and gold, made mad With sweet delights, through the branches slid And kiss'd the lake on a drowsy lid Till the ripples ran and the face was glad; Was glad and lovely as lights that sweep The face of heaven when the stars are forth In autumn time through the sapphire north, Or the face of a child when it smiles in sleep. And here came the Queen, in the tropical noon, When the wars and the world and all were asleep, And nothing look'd forth to betray or to peep Through the glories of jungle in garments of June, To bathe with her court in the waters that bent In the beautiful lake through tasseling trees, And the tangle of blooms in a burden of bees, As bold and as sharp as a bow unspent. And strangely still, and more strangely sweet, Was the lake that lay in its cradle of fern, As still as a moon with her horns that turn In the night, like lamps to white delicate feet. They came and they stood by the brink of the tide, They hung their shields on the boughs of the trees, They lean'd their lances against the side, Unloosed their sandals, and busy as bees Ungather'd their robes in the rustle of leaves That wound them as close as the wine-vine weaves. The minstrel then falter'd, and further aside Then ever before he averted his head; He pick'd up a pebble and fretted the tide Afar, with a countenance flushed and red. He feign'd him ill, he wander'd away, He sat him down by the waters alone, And pray'd for pardon, as a knight should pray, And rued an error not all his own. The Amazons press'd to the girdle of reeds, Two and by two they advanced to the tide, They challenged each other, they laughed in their pride, And banter'd, and vaunted of valorous deeds. They push'd and they parted the curtains of green, All timid at first; then looked in the wave And laugh'd; retreated, then came up brave To the brink of the water, led on by their Queen. Again they retreated, again advanced, Then parted the boughs in a proud disdain, Then bent their heads to the waters, and glanced Below, then blush'd, and then laughed again. A bird awaken'd; then all dismayed With a womanly sense of a beautiful shame That strife and changes had left the same, They shrank to the leaves and the somber shade. At last, press'd forward a beautiful pair And leapt to the wave, and laughing they blushed As rich as their wines; when the waters rush'd To the dimpled limbs, and laugh'd in their hair. The fair troop follow'd with shouts and cheers, They cleft the wave, and the friendly ferns Came down in curtains and curves by turns, And a brave palm lifted a thousand spears. From under the ferns and away from the land, And out in the wave until lost below, There lay, as white as a bank of snow, A long and beautiful border of sand. Here clothed alone in their clouds of hair And curtain'd about by the palm and fern, And made as their maker had made them, fair, And splendid of natural curve and turn; Untrammel'd by art and untroubled by man They tested their strength, or tried their speed: And here they wrestled, and there they ran, As supple and lithe as the watery reed. The great trees shadow'd the bow-tipp'd tide, And nodded their plumes from the opposite side, As if to whisper, Take care! take care! But the meddlesome sunshine here and there Kept pointing a finger right under the trees,— Kept shifting the branches and wagging a hand At the round brown limbs on the border of sand, And seem'd to whisper: Fie! what are these? The gold-barr'd butterflies to and fro And over the waterside wander'd and wove As heedless and idle as clouds that rove And drift by the peaks of perpetual snow. A monkey swung out from a bough in the skies, White-whisker'd and ancient, and wisest of all Of his populous race, when he heard them call And he watch'd them long, with his head sidewise. He wondered much and he watch'd them all From under his brows of amber and brown, All patient and silent, and never once stirr'd Till he saw two wrestle, and wrestling fall; Then he arched his brows and he hasten'd him down To his army below and said never a word. PART IV There is many a love in the land, my love, But never a love like this is; Then kill me dead with your love, my love, And cover me up with kisses. Yea, kill me dead and cover me deep Where never a soul discovers; Deep in your heart to sleep, to sleep, In the darlingest tomb of lovers. The wanderer took him apart from the place; Look'd up in the boughs at the gold birds there, He envied the humming-birds fretting the air, And frowned at the butterflies fanning his face. He sat him down in a crook of the wave And away from the Amazons, under the skies Where great trees curved to a leaf-lined cave, And he lifted his hands and he shaded his eyes: And he held his head to the north when they came To run on the reaches of sand from the south, And he pull'd at his chin, and he pursed his mouth, And he shut his eyes, with a sense of shame. He reach'd and he shaped a bamboo reed From the brink below, and began to blow As if to himself; as the sea sometimes Does soothe and soothe in a low, sweet song, When his rage is spent, and the beach swells strong With sweet repetitions of alliterate rhymes. The echoes blew back from the indolent land; Silent and still sat the tropical bird, And only the sound of the reed was heard, As the Amazons ceased from their sports on the sand. They rose from the wave, and inclining the head, They listened intent, with the delicate tip Of the finger touch'd to the pouting lip, Till the brown Queen turn'd in the tide, and led Through the opaline lake, and under the shade, To the shore where the chivalrous singer played. He bended his head and he shaded his eyes As well as he might with his lifted fingers, And ceased to sing. But in mute surprise He saw them linger as a child that lingers Allured by a song that has ceased in the street, And looks bewilder'd about from its play, For the last loved notes that fell at its feet. How the singer was vexed; he averted his head; He lifted his eyes, looked far and wide For a brief, little time; but they bathed at his side In spite of his will, or of prayers well said. He press'd four fingers against each lid, Till the light was gone; yet for all that he did It seem'd that the lithe forms lay and beat Afloat in his face and full under his feet. He seem'd to behold the billowy breasts, And the rounded limbs in the rest or unrests— To see them swim as the mermaid swims, With the drifting, dimpled delicate limbs, Folded or hidden or reach'd or caress'd. It seems to me there is more that sees Than the eyes in man; you may close your eyes, You may turn your back, and may still be wise In sacred and marvelous mysteries. He saw as one sees the sun of a moon In the sun-kiss'd south, when the eyes are closed— He saw as one sees the bars of a moon That fall through the boughs of the tropical trees, When he lies at length, and is all composed, And asleep in his hammock by the sundown seas. He heard the waters beat, bubble and fret; He lifted his eyes, yet forever they lay Afloat in the tide; and he turn'd him away And resolved to fly and for aye to forget. He rose up strong, and he cross'd him twice, He nerved his heart and he lifted his head, He crush'd the treacherous reed in a trice, With an angry foot, and he turn'd and fled. Yet flying, he hurriedly turn'd his head With an eager glance, with meddlesome eyes, As a woman will turn; and he saw arise The beautiful Queen from the silvery bed. She toss'd back her hair, and she turn'd her eyes With all of their splendor to his as he fled; Ay, all their glory, and a strange surprise, And a sad reproach, and a world unsaid. Then she struck their shields, they rose in array, As roused from a trance, and hurriedly came From out of the wave. He wander'd away, Still fretting his sensitive soul with blame. Alone he sat in the shadows at noon, Alone he sat by the waters at night; Alone he sang, as a woman might, With pale, kind face to the pale, cold moon. He would here advance, and would there retreat, As a petulant child that has lost its way In the redolent walks of a sultry day, And wanders around with irresolute feet. He made him a harp of mahogany wood, He strung it well with the sounding strings Of a strong bird's thews, and from ostrich wings, And play'd and sang in a sad, sweet rune. He hang'd his harp in the vines, and stood By the tide at night, in the palms at noon, And lone as a ghost in the shadowy wood. Then two grew sad, and alone sat she By the great, strong stream, and she bow'd her head, Then lifted her face to the tide, and said: “O, pure as a tear and as strong as a sea, Yet tender to me as the touch of a dove, I had rather sit sad and alone by thee, Than to go and be glad, with a legion in love.” She sat one time at the wanderer's side As the kingly water went wandering by; And the two once look'd, and they knew not why, Full sad in each other's eyes, and they sigh'd. She courted the solitude under the rim Of the trees that reach'd to the resolute stream, And gazed in the waters as one in a dream, Till her soul grew heavy and her eyes grew dim. She bow'd her head with a beautiful grief That grew from her pity; she forgot her arms, And she made neglect of the battle alarms That threaten'd the land; the banana's leaf Made shelter; he lifted his harp again, She sat, she listen'd intent and long, Forgetting her care and forgetting her pain— Made sad for the singer, made glad for his song. And the women waxed cold; the white moons waned, And the brown Queen marshall'd them never once more, With sword and with shield, in the palms by the shore; But they sat them down to repose, or remain'd Apart and scatter'd in the tropic-leaf'd trees, As sadden'd by song, or for loves delay'd; Or away in the Isle in couples they stray'd, Not at all content in their Isles of peace. They wander'd away to the lakes once more, Or walk'd in the moon, or they sigh'd or slept, Or they sat in pairs by the shadowy shore, And silent song with the waters kept. There was one who stood by the waters one eve, With the stars on her hair, and the bars of the moon Broken up at her feet by the bountiful boon Of extending old trees, who did questioning grieve; “The birds they go over us two and by two; The mono is mated; his bride in the boughs Sits nursing his babe, and his passionate vows Of love, you may hear them the whole day through. “The lizard, the cayman, the white-tooth'd boar, The serpents that glide in the sword-leaf'd grass, The beasts that abide or the birds that pass, They are glad in their loves as the green-leaf'd shore. “There is nothing that is that can yield one bliss Like an innocent love; the leaves have tongue And the tides talk low in the reeds, and the young And the quick buds open their lips but for this. “In the steep and the starry silences, On the stormy levels of the limitless seas, Or here in the deeps of the dark-brow'd trees, There is nothing so much as a brave man's kiss. “There is nothing so strong, in the stream, on the land, In the valley of palms, on the pinnacled snow, In the clouds of the gods, on the grasses below, As the silk-soft touch of a baby's brown hand. “It were better to sit and to spin on a stone The whole year through with a babe at the knee, With its brown hands reaching caressingly, Than to sit in a girdle of gold and alone. “It were better indeed to be mothers of men, And to murmur not much; there are clouds in the sun. Can a woman undo what the gods have done? Nay, the things must be as the things have been.” They wander'd well forth, some here and some there, Unsatisfied some and irresolute all. The sun was the same, the moonlight did fall Rich-barr'd and refulgent; the stars were as fair As ever were stars; the fruitful clouds cross'd And the harvest fail'd not; yet the fair Isles grew As a prison to all, and they search'd on through The magnificent shades as for things that were lost. The minstrel, more pensive, went deep in the wood, And oft-time delay'd him the whole day through, As charm'd by the deeps, or the sad heart drew Some solaces sweet from the solitude. The singer forsook them at last, and the Queen Came seldom then forth from the fierce deep wood, And her warriors, dark-brow'd and bewildering stood In bands by the wave in the complicate screen Of overbent boughs. They would lean on their spears And would sometimes talk, low-voiced and by twos, As allured by longings they could not refuse, And would sidewise look, as beset by their fears. Once, wearied and sad, by the shadowy trees In the flush of the sun they sank to their rests, The dark hair veiling the beautiful breasts That arose in billows, as mists veil seas. Then away to the dream-world one by one; The great red sun in his purple was roll'd, And red-wing'd birds and the birds of gold Were above in the trees like the beams of the sun. Then the sun came down, on his ladders of gold Built up of his beams, and the souls arose And ascended on these, and the fair repose Of the negligent forms was a feast to behold. The round brown limbs they were reach'd or drawn, The grass made dark with the fervour of hair; And here were the rose-red lips and there A flush'd breast rose like a sun at a dawn. Then black-wing'd birds flew over in pair, Listless and slow, as they call'd of the seas And sounds came down through the tangle of trees As lost, and nestled, and hid in their hair. They started disturb'd, they sprang as at war To lance and to shield; but the dolorous sound Was gone from the wood; they gazed around And saw but the birds, black-wing'd and afar. They gazed at each other, then turn'd them unheard, Slow trailing their lances, in long single line; They moved through the forest, all dark as the sign Of death that fell down from the ominous bird. Then the great sun died, and a rose-red bloom Grew over his grave in a border of gold, And a cloud with a silver-white rim was roll'd Like a cold gray stone at the door of his tomb. Strange voices were heard, sad visions were seen, By sentries, betimes, on the opposite shore, Where broad boughs bended their curtains of green Far over the wave with their tropical store. A sentry bent low on her palms and she peer'd Suspiciously through; and, heavens! a man, Low-brow'd and wicked, looked backward, and jeer'd And taunted right full in her face as he ran: A low crooked man, with eyes like a bird,— As round and as cunning,—who came from the land Of lakes, where the clouds lie low and at hand, And the songs of the bent black swans are heard; Where men are most cunning and cruel withal, And are famous as spies, and are supple and fleet, And are webb'd like the water-fowl under the feet, And they swim like the swans, and like pelican's call. And again, on a night when the moon she was not, A sentry saw stealing, as still as a dream, A sudden canoe down the mid of the stream, Like the dark boat of death, and as still as a thought. And lo! as it pass'd, from the prow there arose A dreadful and gibbering, hairy old man, Loud laughing as only a maniac can, And shaking a lance at the land of his foes; Then sudden it vanish'd, as still as it came, Far down through the walls of the shadowy wood, And the great moon rose like a forest aflame, All threat'ning, sullen, and red like blood. PART V Well, we have threaded through and through The gloaming forests, Fairy Isles, Afloat in sun and summer smiles, As fallen stars in fields of blue; Some futile wars with subtile love That mortal never vanquish'd yet, Some symphonies by angels set In wave below, in bough above, Were yours and mine; but here adieu. And if it come to pass some days That you grow weary, sad, and you Lift up deep eyes from dusty ways Of mart and moneys to the blue And pure cold waters, isle and vine, And bathe you there, and then arise Refresh'd by one fresh thought of mine, I rest content: I kiss your eyes, I kiss your hair, in my delight: I kiss my hand, and say, “Good-night.” I tell you that love is the bitterest sweet That ever laid hold on the heart of a man; A chain to the soul, and to cheer as a ban, And a bane to the brain and a snare to the feet. Aye! who shall ascend on the hollow white wings Of love but to fall; to fall and to learn, Like a moth, or a man, that the lights lure to burn, That the roses have thorns and the honey-bee stings? I say to you surely that grief shall befall; I lift you my finger, I caution you true, And yet you go forward, laugh gaily, and you Must learn for yourself, then lament for us all. You had better be drown'd than to love and to dream. It were better to sit on a moss-grown stone, And away from the sun, forever alone, Slow pitching white pebbles at trout in a stream. Alas for a heart that must live forlorn! If you live you must love; if you love, regret— It were better, perhaps, had you never been born, Or better, at least, you could well forget. The clouds are above us and snowy and cold, And what is beyond but the steel gray sky, And the still far stars that twinkle and lie Like the eyes of a love or delusions of gold! Ah! who would ascend? The clouds are above. Aye! all things perish; to rise is to fall. And alack for lovers, and alas for love, And alas that we ever were born at all. The minstrel now stood by the border of wood, But now not alone; with a resolute heart He reach'd his hand, like to one made strong, Forgot his silence and resumed his song, And aroused his soul, and assumed his part With a passionate will, in the palms where he stood. “She is sweet as the breath of the Castile rose, She is warm to the heart as a world of wine, And as rich to behold as the rose that grows With its red heart bent to the tide of the Rhine. “I shall sip her lips as the brown bees sup From the great gold heart of the buttercup! I shall live and love! I shall have my day, And die in my time, and who shall gainsay? “What boots me the battles that I have fought With self for honor? My brave resolves? And who takes note? The soul dissolves In a sea of love, and the wars are forgot. “The march of men, and the drift of ships, The dreams of fame, and desires for gold, Shall go for aye as a tale that is told, Nor divide for a day my lips from her lips. “And a knight shall rest, and none shall say nay, In a green Isle wash'd by an arm of the seas, And walled from the world by the white Andes: The years are of age and can go their way.” A sentinel stood on the farthermost land, And struck her shield, and her sword in hand, She cried, “He comes with his silver spears, With flint-tipp'd arrows and bended bows, To take our blood though we give him tears, And to flood our Isle in a world of woes! “He comes, O Queen of the sun-kiss'd Isle, He comes as a wind comes, blown from the seas, In a cloud of canoes, on the curling breeze, With his shields of tortoise and of crocodile!” Sweeter than swans' are a maiden's graces! Sweeter than fruits are the kisses of morn! Sweeter than babes' is a love new-born, But sweeter than all are a love's embraces. The Queen was at peace. Her terms of surrender To love, who knows? and who can defend her? She slept at peace, and the sentry's warning Could scarce awaken the love-conquer'd Queen; She slept at peace in the opaline Hush and blush of that tropical morning; And bound about by the twining glory, Vine and trellis in the vernal morn, As still and sweet as a babe new-born, The brown Queen dream'd of the old new story. But hark! her sentry's passionate words, The sound of shields, and the clash of swords! And slow she came, her head on her breast, And her two hands held as to plead for rest. Where, O where, were the Juno graces? Where, O where, was the glance of Jove, As the Queen came forth from the sacred places, Hidden away in the heart of the grove? They rallied around as of old,—they besought her, With swords to the sun and the sounding shield, To lead them again to the glorious field, So sacred to Freedom; and, breathless, they brought her Her buckler and sword, and her armor all bright With a thousand gems enjewell'd in gold. She lifted her head with the look of old An instant only; with all of her might She sought to be strong and majestic again. She bared them her arms and her ample brown breast; They lifted her armor, they strove to invest Her form in armor, but they strove in vain. It could close no more, but it clang'd on the ground, Like the fall of a knight, with an ominous sound, And she shook her hair and she cried “Alas! That love should come and liberty pass;” And she cried, “Alas! to be cursed ... and bless'd For the nights of love and noons of rest.” Her warriors wonder'd; they wander'd apart, And trail'd their swords, and subdued their eyes To earth in sorrow and in hush'd surprise, And forgot themselves in their pity of heart. “O Isles of the sun,” sang the blue-eyed youth, “O Edens new-made and let down from above! Be sacred to peace and to passionate love, Made happy in peace and made holy with truth.” The fair Isle fill'd with the fierce invader; They form'd on the strand, they lifted their spears, Where never was man for years and for years, And moved on the Queen. She lifted and laid her Finger-tips to her lips. For O sweet Was the song of love as the love new-born, That the minstrel blew in the virgin morn, Away where the trees and the soft sands meet. The strong men lean'd and their shields let fall, And slowly they came with their trailing spears, And heads bow'd down as if bent with years, And an air of gentleness over them all. The men grew glad as the song ascended, They lean'd their lances against the palms, They reach'd their arms as to reach for alms, And the Amazons came—and their reign was ended. The tawny old crone here lays her stone On the leaning grass and reaches a hand; The day like a beautiful dream has flown, The curtains of night come down on the land, And I dip to the oars; but ere I go, I tip her an extra bright pesos or so, And I smile my thanks, for I think them due: But, reader, fair reader, now what think you? I do not like this, although I have cut it up and cut it down, and worked it over and over more than anything else. I had seen this vast and indescribable country, but not absorbed it; and that, most likely, is the reason it seems artificial and foolish, with knights and other things that I know nothing about. The only thing that I like in it is the water. I can handle water, and water is water the world over. But had it not been for the water and some of the wild tangles and jungles the whole thing would, ere this, have gone where the biggest half went long since. It was written in San Francisco, and was published at the same time in the Overland there and the Gentleman's Magazine in London. It was written at the instance of the Emperor, who translated it and to the last was brave and courtly enough to insist that it was good work. I had hoped to induce people to pour out of crowded London and better their fortunes there; for there is great wealth far, far up the Amazon. Aye, what exultant pride swelled my heart one happy day in Rome when Partridge, our minister to Brazil, gave me that message of thanks from the good Emperor, with a request to make his home my own while he lived. AN INDIAN SUMMER The world it is wide; men go their ways But love he is wise, and of all the hours, And of all the beautiful sun-born days, He sips their sweets as the bee sips flowers. The sunlight lay in gather'd sheaves Along the ground, the golden leaves Possess'd the land and lay in bars Above the lifted lawn of green Beneath the feet, or fell, as stars Fall, slantwise, shimmering and still Upon the plain, upon the hill, And heaving hill and plain between. Some steeds in panoply were seen, Strong, martial trained, with manes in air, And tassell'd reins and mountings rare; Some silent people here and there, That gather'd leaves with listless will, Or moved adown the dappled green, Or look'd away with idle gaze Against the gold and purple haze. You might have heard red leaflets fall, The pheasant on the farther hill, A single, lonely, locust trill, Or sliding sable cricket call From out the grass, but that was all. A wanderer of many lands Was I, a weary Ishmaelite, That knew the sign of lifted hands; Had seen the Crescent-mosques, had seen The Druid oaks of Aberdeen— Recross'd the hilly seas, and saw The sable pines of Mackinaw, And lakes that lifted cold and white. I saw the sweet Miami, saw The swift Ohio bent and roll'd Between his woody walls of gold, The Wabash banks of gray pawpaw, The Mississippi's ash; at morn Of autumn, when the oak is red, Saw slanting pyramids of corn, The level fields of spotted swine, The crooked lanes of lowing kine, And in the burning bushes saw The face of God, with bended head. But when I saw her face, I said, “Earth has no fruits so fairly red As these that swing above my head; No purpled leaf, no poppied land, Like this that lies in reach of hand.” And, soft, unto myself I said: “O soul, inured to rue and rime, To barren toil and bitter bread, To biting rime, to bitter rue, Earth is not Nazareth; be good. O sacred Indian-summer time Of scarlet fruits, of fragrant wood, Of purpled clouds, of curling haze— O days of golden dreams, and days Of banish'd, vanish'd tawny men, Of martial songs of manly deeds— Be fair today, and bear me true.” We mounted, turn'd the sudden steeds Toward the yellow hills and flew. My faith! but she rode fair, and she Had scarlet berries in her hair, And on her hands white starry stones. The satellites of many thrones Fall down before her gracious air In that full season. Fair to see Are pearly shells, red, virgin gold, And yellow fruits, and sun-down seas, And babes sun-brown; but all of these, And all fair things of sea besides, Before the matchless, manifold Accomplishments of her who rides With autumn summer in her hair, And knows her steed and holds her fair And stately in her stormy seat, They lie like playthings at her feet. By heaven! she was more than fair, And more than good, and matchless wise, With all the lovelight in her eyes, And all the midnight in her hair. Through leafy avenues and lanes, And lo! we climb'd the yellow hills, With russet leaves about the brows That reach'd from over-reaching trees. With purpled briars to the knees Of steeds that fretted foamy thews We turn'd to look a time below Beneath the ancient arch of boughs, That bent above us as a bow Of promise, bound in many hues. I reach'd my hand. I could refuse All fruits but this, the touch of her At such a time. But lo! she lean'd With lifted face and soul, and leant As leans devoutest worshipper, Beyond the branches scarlet screen'd And look'd above me and beyond, So fix'd and silent, still and fond, She seem'd the while she look'd to lose Her very soul in such intent. She look'd on other things, but I, I saw nor scarlet leaf nor sky; I look'd on her, and only her. Afar the city lay in smokes Of battle, and the martial strokes Of Progress thunder'd through the land And struck against the yellow trees, And roll'd in hollow echoes on Like sounding limits of the seas That smite the shelly shores at dawn. Beyond, below, on either hand There reach'd a lake in belt of pine, A very dream; a distant dawn Asleep in all the autumn shine, Some like one of another land That I once laid a hand upon, And loved too well, and named as mine. She sometimes touch'd with dimpl'd hand The drifting mane with dreamy air, She sometimes push'd aback her hair; But still she lean'd and look'd afar, As silent as the statues stand,— For what? For falling leaf? For star That runs before the bride of death? The elements were still; a breath Stirr'd not, the level western sun Pour'd in his arrows every one; Spill'd all his wealth of purpled red On velvet poplar leaf below, On arching chestnut overhead In all the hues of heaven's bow. She sat the upper hill, and high. I spurr'd my black steed to her side; “The bow of promise, lo!” I cried, And lifted up my eyes to hers With all the fervid love that stirs The blood of men beneath the sun, And reach'd my hand, as one undone, In suppliance to hers above: “The bow of promise! give me love! I reach a hand, I rise or fall, Henceforth from this: put forth a hand From your high place and let me stand— Stand soul and body, white and tall! Why, I would live for you, would die Tomorrow, but to live today, Give me but love, and let me live To die before you. I can pray To only you, because I know, If you but give what I bestow, That God has nothing left to give.” Christ! still her stately head was raised, And still she silent sat and gazed Beyond the trees, beyond the town, To where the dimpled waters slept, Nor splendid eyes once bended down To eyes that lifted up and wept. She spake not, nor subdued her head To note a hand or heed a word; And then I question'd if she heard My life-tale on that leafy hill, Or any fervid word I said, And spoke with bold, vehement will. She moved, and from her bridle hand She slowly drew the dainty glove, Then gazed again upon the land. The dimpled hand, a snowy dove Alit, and moved along the mane Of glossy skeins; then, overbold, It fell across the mane, and lay Before my eyes a sweet bouquet Of cluster'd kisses, white as snow. I should have seized it reaching so, But something bade me back,—a ban; Around the third fair finger ran A shining, hateful hoop of gold. Ay, then I turn'd, I look'd away, I sudden felt forlorn and chill; I whistled, like, for want to say, And then I said, with bended head, “Another's ship from other shores, With richer freight, with fairer stores, Shall come to her some day instead”; Then turn'd about,—and all was still. Yea, you had chafed at this, and cried, And laugh'd with bloodless lips, and said Some bitter things to sate your pride, And toss'd aloft a lordly head, And acted well some wilful lie, And, most like, cursed yourself—but I .. Well, you be crucified, and you Be broken up with lances through The soul, then you may turn to find Some ladder-rounds in keenest rods, Some solace in the bitter rind, Some favor with the gods irate— The everlasting anger'd gods— And ask not overmuch of fate. I was not born, was never bless'd, With cunning ways, nor wit, nor skill In woman's ways, nor words of love, Nor fashion'd suppliance of will. A very clown, I think, had guess'd How out of place and plain I seem'd; I, I, the idol-worshiper, Who saw nor maple leaves nor sky But took some touch and hue of her. I am a pagan, heathen, lo! A savage man, of savage lands; Too quick to love, too slow to know The sign that tame love understands. Some heedless hoofs went sounding down The broken way. The woods were brown, And homely now; some idle talk Of folk and town; a broken walk; But sounding feet made song no more For me along that leafy shore. The sun caught up his gathered sheaves; A squirrel caught a nut and ran; A rabbit rustled in the leaves, A whirling bat, black-wing'd and tan, Blew swift between us; sullen night Fell down upon us; mottled kine, With lifted heads, went lowing down The rocky ridge toward the town, And all the woods grew dark as wine. Yea, bless'd Ohio's banks are fair; A sunny clime and good to touch, For tamer men of gentler mien, But as for me, another scene. A land below the Alps I know, Set well with grapes and girt with much Of woodland beauty; I shall share My rides by night below the light Of Mauna Loa, ride below The steep and starry Hebron height; Shall lift my hands in many lands, See South Sea palm, see Northland fir, See white-winged swans, see red-bill'd doves; See many lands and many loves, But never more the face of her. And what her name or now the place Of her who makes my Mecca's prayer, Concerns you not; not any trace Of entrance to my temple's shrine Remains. The memory is mine, And none shall pass the portals there. I see the gold and purple gleam Of autumn leaves, a reach of seas, A silent rider like a dream Moves by, a mist of mysteries, And these are mine, and only these, Yet they be more in my esteem, Than silver'd sails on corall'd seas. The present! take it, hold it thine, But that one hour out from all The years that are, or yet shall fall, I pluck it out, I name it mine; That hour bound in sunny sheaves, With tassell'd shocks of golden shine, That hour wound in scarlet leaves, Is mine. I stretch a hand and swear An oath that breaks into a prayer; By heaven, it is wholly mine! I wrote, or rather lived, this bit of color at Cleveland, Ohio, giving it the entire autumn of gold. The prime purpose was to get the atmosphere of an Ohio Saint Martin's summer, but it grew to be a very serious matter. Yet we must, in some sort at least, live what we write if what we write is to live. FROM SEA TO SEA Lo! here sit we by the sun-down seas And the White Sierras. The sweet sea-breeze Is about us here; and a sky so fair Is bending above, so cloudless, blue, That you gaze and you gaze and you dream, and you See God and the portals of heaven there. Shake hands! kiss hands in haste to the sea, Where the sun comes in, and mount with me The matchless steed of the strong New World, As he champs and chafes with a strength untold,— And away to the West where the waves are curl'd, As they kiss white palms to the capes of gold! A girth of brass and a breast of steel, A breath of flame and a flaming mane, An iron hoof and a steel-clad heel, A Mexican bit and a massive chain Well tried and wrought in an iron rein; And away! away! with a shout and yell That had stricken a legion of old with fear, They had started the dead from their graves whilere, And startled the damn'd in hell as well. Stand up! stand out! where the wind comes in And the wealth of the sea pours over you, As its health floods up to the face like wine, And a breath blows up from the Delaware And the Susquehanna. We feel the might Of armies in us; the blood leaps through The frame with a fresh and a keen delight As the Alleghanies have kiss'd the hair, With a kiss blown far through the rush and din, By the chestnut burrs and through boughs of pine. O seas in a land! O lakes of mine! By the love I bear and the songs I bring Be glad with me! lift your waves and sing A song in the reeds that surround your isles!— A song of joy for this sun that smiles, For this land I love and this age and sign; For the peace that is and the perils pass'd; For the hope that is and the rest at last! O heart of the world's heart! West! my West! Look up! look out! There are fields of kine, There are clover-fields that are red as wine; And a world of kine in the fields take rest, As they ruminate in the shade of trees That are white with blossoms or brown with bees. There are emerald seas of corn and cane; There are isles of oak on the harvest plain, Where brawn men bend to the bending grain; There are temples of God and towns new born, And beautiful homes of beautiful brides; And the hearts of oak and the hands of horn Have fashion'd all these and a world besides ... A rush of rivers and a brush of trees, A breath blown far from the Mexican seas, And over the great heart-vein of earth! ... By the South-Sun-land of the Cherokee, By the scalp-lock-lodge of the tall Pawnee, And up La Platte. What a weary dearth Of the homes of men! What a wild delight Of space! of room! What a sense of seas, Where the seas are not! What a salt-like breeze! What dust and taste of quick alkali! ... Then hills! green, brown, then black like night, All fierce and defiant against the sky! At last! at last! O steed new-born, Born strong of the will of the strong New World, We shoot to the summit, with the shafts of morn, On the mount of Thunder, where clouds are curl'd, Below in a splendor of the sun-clad seas. A kiss of welcome on the warm west breeze Blows up with a smell of the fragrant pine, And a faint, sweet fragrance from the far-off seas Comes in through the gates of the great South Pass, And thrills the soul like a flow of wine. The hare leaps low in the storm-bent grass, The mountain ram from his cliff looks back, The brown deer hies to the tamarack; And afar to the South with a sound of the main, Roll buffalo herds to the limitless plain. ... On, on, o'er the summit; and onward again, And down like the sea-dove the billow enshrouds, And down like the swallow that dips to the sea, We dart and we dash and we quiver and we Are blowing to heaven white billows of clouds. Thou “City of Saints!” O antique men, And men of the Desert as the men of old! Stand up! be glad! When the truths are told, When Time has utter'd his truths and when His hand has lifted the things to fame From the mass of things to be known no more, A monument set in the desert sand, A pyramid rear'd on an inland shore, And their architects shall have place and name. The Humboldt desert and the alkaline land, And the seas of sage and of arid sand That stretch away till the strain'd eye carries The soul where the infinite spaces fill, Are far in the rear, and the fierce Sierras Are under our feet, and the hearts beat high And the blood comes quick; but the lips are still With awe and wonder, and all the will Is bow'd with a grandeur that frets the sky. A flash of lakes through the fragrant trees, A song of birds and a sound of bees Above in the boughs of the sugar-pine. The pick-ax stroke in the placer mine, The boom of blasts in the gold-ribbed hills, The grizzly's growl in the gorge below Are dying away, and the sound of rills From the far-off shimmering crest of snow, The laurel green and the ivied oak, A yellow stream and a cabin's smoke, The brown bent hills and the shepherd's call, The hills of vine and of fruits, and all The sweets of Eden are here, and we Look out and afar to a limitless sea. We have lived an age in a half-moon-wane! We have seen a world! We have chased the sun From sea to sea; but the task is done. We here descend to the great white main— To the King of Seas, with its temples bare And a tropic breath on the brow and hair. We are hush'd with wonder, we stand apart, We stand in silence; the heaving heart Fills full of heaven, and then the knees Go down in worship on the golden sands. With faces seaward, and with folded hands We gaze on the boundless, white Balboa seas. This was written during my first railroad ride from New York to San Francisco, at a time when this was the greatest ride on the globe and parties came to California in great crowds to look upon the sundown seas. It is to be deplored that zeal and interest have so nearly perished with the novelty of the great journey. A SONG OF THE SOUTH Part I Rhyme on, rhyme on, in reedy flow, O river, rhymer ever sweet! The story of thy land is meet; The stars stand listening to know. Rhyme on, O river of the earth! Gray father of the dreadful seas, Rhyme on! the world upon its knees Invokes thy songs, thy wealth, thy worth. Rhyme on! the reed is at thy mouth, O kingly minstrel, mighty stream! Thy Crescent City, like a dream, Hangs in the heaven of my South. Rhyme on, rhyme on! these broken strings Sing sweetest in this warm south wind; I sit thy willow banks and bind A broken harp that fitful sings. I And where is my silent, sweet blossom-sown town? And where is her glory, and what has she done? By her Mexican seas in the path of the sun, Sit you down; in her crescent of seas, sit you down. Aye, glory enough by her Mexican seas! Aye, story enough in that battle-torn town, Hidden down in her crescent of seas, hidden down In her mantle and sheen of magnolia-white trees. But mine is the story of souls; of a soul That barter'd God's limitless kingdom for gold,— Sold stars and all space for a thing he did hold In his palm for a day; and then hid with the mole: Sad soul of a rose-land, of moss-mantled oak— Gray, Druid-old oaks; and the moss that sways And swings in the wind is the battle-smoke Of duelists dead, in her storied days: Sad soul of a love-land, of church-bells and chimes; A love-land of altars and orange-flowers; And that is the reason for all these rhymes— That church-bells are ringing through all these hours! This sun-land has churches, has priests at prayer, White nuns, that are white as the far north snow: They go where duty may bid them go,— They dare when the angel of death is there. This love-land has ladies, so fair, so fair, In their Creole quarter, with great black eyes— So fair that the Mayor must keep them there Lest troubles, like troubles of Troy, arise. This sun-land has ladies with eyes held down, Held down, because if they lifted them, Why, you would be lost in that old French town, Though even you held to God's garment hem. This love-land has ladies so fair, so fair, That they bend their eyes to the holy book, Lest you should forget yourself, your prayer, And never more cease to look and to look. And these are the ladies that no men see, And this is the reason men see them not; Better their modest, sweet mystery— Better by far than red battle-shot. And so, in this curious old town of tiles, The proud French quarter of days long gone, In castles of Spain and tumble-down piles, These wonderful ladies live on and on. I sit in the church where they come and go; I dream of glory that has long since gone; Of the low raised high, of the high brought low As in battle-torn days of Napoleon. These brass-plaited places, so rich, so poor! One quaint old church at the edge of the town Has white tombs laid to the very church door— White leaves in the story of life turn'd down: White leaves in the story of life are these, The low, white slabs in the long, strong grass, Where glory has emptied her hour-glass, And dreams with the dreamers beneath the trees. I dream with the dreamers beneath the sod, Where souls pass by to the great white throne; I count each tomb as a mute mile-stone For weary, sweet souls on their way to God. I sit all day by the vast, strong stream, 'Mid low white slabs in the long, strong grass, Where time has forgotten for aye to pass, To dream, and ever to dream and to dream. This quaint old church, with its dead to the door, By the cypress swamp at the edge of the town, So restful it seems that you want to sit down And rest you, and rest you for evermore. III The azure curtain of God's house Draws back, and hangs star-pinned to space; I hear the low, large moon arouse, And slowly lift her languid face. I see her shoulder up the east, Low-necked, and large as womanhood— Low-necked, as for some ample feast Of gods, within yon orange-wood. She spreads white palms, she whispers peace,— Sweet peace on earth forevermore; Sweet peace for two beneath the trees, Sweet peace for one within the door. The bent stream, as God's scimitar, Flashed in the sun, sweeps on and on, Till sheathed, like some great sword new-drawn, In seas beneath the Carib's star. The high moon climbs the sapphire hill, The lone sweet lady prays within; The crickets keep such clang and din— They are so loud, earth is so still! And two men glare in silence there! The bitter, jealous hate of each Has grown too deep for deed or speech— The lone sweet lady keeps her prayer. The vast moon high through heaven's field In circling chariot is rolled; The golden stars are spun and reeled, And woven into cloth of gold. The white magnolia fills the night With perfume, as the proud moon fills The glad earth with her ample light From out her awful sapphire hills. White orange-blossoms fill the boughs Above, about the old church-door; They wait the bride, the bridal vows,— They never hung so fair before. The two men glare as dark as sin! And yet all seem so fair, so white, You would not reckon it was night,— The while the lady prays within. IV She prays so very long and late,— The two men, weary, waiting there,— The great magnolia at the gate Bends drowsily above her prayer. The cypress in his cloak of moss, That watches on in silent gloom, Has leaned and shaped a shadow cross Above the nameless, lowly tomb. What can she pray for? What her sin? What folly of a maid so fair? What shadows bind the wondrous hair Of one who prays so long within? The palm-trees guard in regiment, Stand right and left without the gate; The myrtle-moss trees wait and wait; The tall magnolia leans intent. The cypress-trees, on gnarled old knees, Far out the dank and marshy deep Where slimy monsters groan and creep, Kneel with her in their marshy seas. What can her sin be? Who shall know? The night flies by,—a bird on wing; The men no longer to and fro Stride up and down, or anything. For one, so weary and so old, Has hardly strength to stride or stir; He can but hold his bags of gold,— But hug his gold and wait for her. The two stand still,—stand face to face. The moon slides on, the midnight air Is perfumed as a house of prayer,— The maiden keeps her holy place. Two men! And one is gray, but one Scarce lifts a full-grown face as yet; With light foot on life's threshold set,— Is he the other's sun-born son? And one is of the land of snow, And one is of the land of sun; A black-eyed, burning youth is one, But one has pulses cold and slow: Aye, cold and slow from clime of snow Where Nature's bosom, icy bound, Holds all her forces, hard, profound,— Holds close where all the South lets go. Blame not the sun, blame not the snows,— God's great schoolhouse for all is clime; The great school teacher, Father Time, And each has borne as best he knows. At last the elder speaks,—he cries,— He speaks as if his heart would break; He speaks out as a man that dies,— As dying for some lost love's sake: “Come, take this bag of gold, and go! Come, take one bag! See, I have two! Oh, why stand silent, staring so, When I would share my gold with you? “Come, take this gold! See how I pray! See how I bribe, and beg, and buy,— Aye, buy! and beg, as you, too, may Some day before you come to die. “God! take this gold, I beg, I pray! I beg as one who thirsting cries For but one drop of drink, and dies In some lone, loveless desert way. “You hesitate? Still hesitate? Stand silent still and mock my pain? Still mock to see me wait and wait, And wait her love, as earth waits rain?” V O broken ship! O starless shore! O black and everlasting night! Where love comes never any more To light man's way with heaven's light. A godless man with bags of gold I think a most unholy sight; Ah, who so desolate at night, Amid death's sleepers still and cold? A godless man on holy ground I think a most unholy sight. I hear death trailing, like a hound, Hard after him, and swift to bite. VI The vast moon settles to the west; Yet still two men beside that tomb, And one would sit thereon to rest,— Aye, rest below, if there were room. VII What is this rest of death, sweet friend? What is the rising up, and where? I say, death is a lengthened prayer, A longer night, a larger end. Hear you the lesson I once learned: I died; I sailed a million miles Through dreamful, flowery, restful isles,— She was not there, and I returned. I say the shores of death and sleep Are one; that when we, wearied, come To Lethe's waters, and lie dumb, 'Tis death, not sleep, holds us to keep. Yea, we lie dead for need of rest, And so the soul drifts out and o'er The vast still waters to the shore Beyond, in pleasant, tranquil quest: It sails straight on, forgetting pain, Past isles of peace, to perfect rest,— Now were it best abide, or best Return and take up life again? And that is all of death there is, Believe me. If you find your love In that far land, then, like the dove, Pluck olive boughs, nor back to this. But if you find your love not there; Or if your feet feel sure, and you Have still allotted work to do,— Why, then haste back to toil and care. Death is no mystery. 'Tis plain If death be mystery, then sleep Is mystery thrice strangely deep,— For oh, this coming back again! Austerest ferryman of souls! I see the gleam of shining shores; I hear thy steady stroke of oars Above the wildest wave that rolls. O Charon, keep thy somber ships! I come, with neither myrrh nor balm, Nor silver piece in open palm,— Just lone, white silence on my lips. VIII She prays so long! she prays so late! What sin in all this flower land Against her supplicating hand Could have in heaven any weight? Prays she for her sweet self alone? Prays she for some one far away, Or some one near and dear today, Or some poor lorn, lost soul unknown? It seems to me a selfish thing To pray forever for one's self; It seems to me like heaping pelf, In heaven by hard reckoning. Why, I would rather stoop and bear My load of sin, and bear it well And bravely down to your hard hell, Than pray and pray a selfish prayer! IX The swift chameleon in the gloom— This gray morn silence so profound!— Forsakes its bough, glides to the ground, Then up, and lies across the tomb. It erst was green as olive-leaf; It then grew gray as myrtle moss The time it slid the tomb across; And now 't is marble-white as grief. The little creature's hues are gone Here in the gray and ghostly light; It lies so pale, so panting white,— White as the tomb it lies upon. The two still by that nameless tomb! And both so still! You might have said, These two men, they are also dead, And only waiting here for room. How still beneath the orange-bough! How tall was one, how bowed was one! The one was as a journey done, The other as beginning now. And one was young,—young with that youth Eternal that belongs to truth; And one was old,—old with the years That follow fast on doubts and fears. And yet the habit of command Was his, in every stubborn part; No common knave was he at heart, Nor his the common coward's hand. He looked the young man in the face, So full of hate, so frank of hate; The other, standing in his place, Stared back as straight and hard as fate. And now he sudden turned away, And now he paced the path, and now Came back beneath the orange bough, Pale-browed, with lips as cold as clay. As mute as shadows on a wall, As silent still, as dark as they, Before that stranger, bent and gray, The youth stood scornful, proud and tall. He stood a clean palmetto tree With Spanish daggers guarding it; Nor deed, nor word, to him seemed fit While she prayed on so silently. He slew his rival with his eyes His eyes were daggers piercing deep,— So deep that blood began to creep From their deep wounds and drop wordwise. His eyes so black, so bright, that they Might raise the dead, the living slay, If but the dead, the living bore Such hearts as heroes had of yore. Two deadly arrows barbed in black, And feathered, too, with raven's wing; Two arrows that could silent sting, And with a death-wound answer back. How fierce he was! how deadly still In that mesmeric, searching stare Turned on the pleading stranger there That drew to him, despite his will! So like a bird down-fluttering, Down, down, beneath a snake's bright eyes, He stood, a fascinated thing, That hopeless, unresisting, dies. He raised a hard hand as before, Reached out the gold, and offered it With hand that shook as ague-fit,— The while the youth but scorned the more. “You will not touch it? In God's name, Who are you, and what are you, then? Come, take this gold, and be of men,— A human form with human aim. “Yea, take this gold,—she must be mine! She shall be mine! I do not fear Your scowl, your scorn, your soul austere, The living, dead, or your dark sign. “I saw her as she entered there; I saw her, and uncovered stood; The perfume of her womanhood Was holy incense on the air. “She left behind sweet sanctity, Religion went the way she went; I cried I would repent, repent! She passed on, all unheeding me. “Her soul is young, her eyes are bright And gladsome, as mine own are dim; But oh, I felt my senses swim The time she passed me by tonight!— “The time she passed, nor raised her eyes To hear me cry I would repent, Nor turned her head to hear my cries, But swifter went the way she went,— “Went swift as youth, for all these years! And this the strangest thing appears, That lady there seems just the same,— Sweet Gladys—Ah! you know her name? “You hear her name and start that I Should name her dear name trembling so? Why, boy, when I shall come to die That name shall be the last I know. “That name shall be the last sweet name My lips shall utter in this life! That name is brighter than bright flame,— That lady is mine own sweet wife! “Ah, start and catch your burning breath! Ah, start and clutch your deadly knife! If this be death, then be it death,— But that loved lady is my wife! “Yea, you are stunned! your face is white, That I should come confronting you, As comes a lorn ghost of the night From out the past, and to pursue. “You thought me dead? You shake your head, You start back horrified to know That she is loved, that she is wed, That you have sinned in loving so. “Yet what seems strange, that lady there, Housed in the holy house of prayer, Seems just the same for all her tears,— For all my absent twenty years. “Yea, twenty years tonight, tonight,— Just twenty years this day, this hour, Since first I plucked that perfect flower, And not one witness of the rite. “Nay, do not doubt,—I tell you true! Her prayers, her tears, her constancy Are all for me, are all for me,— And not one single thought for you! “I knew, I knew she would be here This night of nights to pray for me! And how could I for twenty year Know this same night so certainly? “Ah me! some thoughts that we would drown, Stick closer than a brother to The conscience, and pursue, pursue, Like baying hound, to hunt us down. “And, then, that date is history; For on that night this shore was shelled, And many a noble mansion felled, With many a noble family. “I wore the blue; I watched the flight Of shells, like stars tossed through the air To blow your hearth-stones—anywhere, That wild, illuminated night. “Nay, rage befits you not so well; Why, you were but a babe at best; Your cradle some sharp bursted shell That tore, maybe, your mother's breast! “Hear me! We came in honored war. The risen world was on your track! The whole North-land was at our back, From Hudson's bank to the North Star! “And from the North to palm-set sea The splendid fiery cyclone swept. Your fathers fell, your mothers wept, Their nude babes clinging to the knee. “A wide and desolated track: Behind, a path of ruin lay; Before, some women by the way Stood mutely gazing, clad in black. “From silent women waiting there White tears came down like still, small rain; Their own sons of the battle-plain Were now but viewless ghosts of air. “Their own dear, daring boys in gray,— They should not see them any more; Our cruel drums kept telling o'er The time their own sons went away. “Through burning town, by bursting shell— Yea, I remember well that night; I led through orange-lanes of light, As through some hot outpost of hell! “That night of rainbow shot and shell Sent from yon surging river's breast To waken me, no more to rest,— That night I should remember well! “That night, amid the maimed and dead— A night in history set down By light of many a burning town, And written all across in red,— “Her father dead, her brothers dead, Her home in flames,—what else could she But fly all helpless here to me, A fluttered dove, that night of dread? “Short time, hot time had I to woo Amid the red shells battle-chime; But women rarely reckon time, And perils waken love anew. “Aye, then I wore a captain's sword; And, too, had oftentime before Doffed cap at her dead father's door, And passed a lover's pleasant word. “And then—ah, I was comely then! I bore no load upon my back, I heard no hounds upon my track, But stood the tallest of tall men. “Her father's and her mother's shrine, This church amid the orange-wood; So near and so secure it stood, It seemed to beckon as a sign. “Its white cross seemed to beckon me; My heart was strong, and it was mine To throw myself upon my knee, To beg to lead her to this shrine. “She did consent. Through lanes of light I led through this church-door that night— Let fall your hand! Take back your face And stand,—stand patient in your place! “She loved me; and she loves me still. Yea, she clung close to me that hour As honey-bee to honey-flower,— And still is mine through good or ill. “The priest stood there. He spake the prayer; He made the holy, mystic sign, And she was mine, was wholly mine,— Is mine this moment, I can swear! “Then days, then nights of vast delight,— Then came a doubtful later day; The faithful priest, nor far away, Watched with the dying in the fight: “The priest amid the dying, dead, Kept duty on the battle-field,— That midnight marriage unrevealed Kept strange thoughts running thro' my head. “At last a stray ball struck the priest; This vestibule his chancel was; And now none lived to speak her cause, Record, or champion her the least. “Hear me! I had been bred to hate All priests, their mummeries and all. Ah, it was fate,—ah, it was fate That all things tempted to my fall! “And then the dashing songs we sang Those nights when rudely reveling,— Such songs that only soldiers sing,— Until the very tent-poles rang! “What is the rhyme that rhymers say, Of maidens born to be betrayed By epaulettes and shining blade, While soldiers love and ride away? “And then my comrades spake her name Half taunting, with a touch of shame; Taught me to hold that lily-flower As some light pastime of the hour. “And then the ruin in the land, The death, dismay, the lawlessness! Men gathered gold on every hand,— Heaped gold: and why should I do less? “The cry for gold was in the air,— For Creole gold, for precious things; The sword kept prodding here and there, Through bolts and sacred fastenings. “‘Get gold! get gold!’ This was the cry. And I loved gold. What else could I Or you, or any earnest one, Born in this getting age, have done? “With this one lesson taught from youth, And ever taught us, to get gold,— To get and hold, and ever hold,— What else could I have done, forsooth? “She, seeing how I crazed for gold,— This girl, my wife, one late night told Of treasures hidden close at hand, In her dead father's mellow land; “Of gold she helped her brothers hide Beneath a broad banana-tree The day the two in battle died, The night she, dying, fled to me. “It seemed too good; I laughed to scorn Her trustful tale. She answered not; But meekly on the morrow morn These two great bags of bright gold brought. “And when she brought this gold to me,— Red Creole gold, rich, rare, and old,— When I at last had gold, sweet gold, I cried in very ecstasy. “Red gold! rich gold! two bags of gold! The two stout bags of gold she brought And gave, with scarce a second thought,— Why, her two hands could scarcely hold! “Now I had gold! two bags of gold! Two wings of gold, to fly, and fly The wide world's girth; red gold to hold Against my heart for aye and aye! “My country's lesson: ‘Gold! get gold!’ I learned it well in land of snow; And what can glow, so brightly glow, Long winter nights of northern cold? “Aye, now at last, at last I had The one thing, all fair things above, My land had taught me most to love! A miser now! and I grew mad. “With these two bags of gold my own, I soon began to plan some night For flight, for far and sudden flight,— For flight; and, too, for flight alone. “I feared! I feared! My heart grew cold,— Some one might claim this gold of me! I feared her,—feared her purity— Feared all things but my bags of gold. “I grew to hate her face, her creed,— That face the fairest ever yet That bowed o'er holy cross or bead, Or yet was in God's image set. “I fled,—nay, not so knavish low, As you have fancied, did I fly: I sought her at this shrine, and I Told her full frankly I should go. “I stood a giant in my power,— And did she question or dispute? I stood a savage, selfish brute,— She bowed her head, a lily-flower. “And when I sudden turned to go, And told her I should come no more, She bowed her head so low, so low, Her vast black hair fell pouring o'er. “And that was all; her splendid face Was mantled from me, and her night Of hair half hid her from my sight, As she fell moaning in her place. “And there, through her dark night of hair, She sobbed, low moaning in her tears, That she would wait, wait all the years,— Would wait and pray in her despair. “Nay, did not murmur, not deny,— She did not cross me one sweet word! I turned and fled; I thought I heard A night-bird's piercing low death-cry!” PART II. How soft the moonlight of my South! How sweet the South in soft moonlight! I want to kiss her warm, sweet mouth As she lies sleeping here tonight. How still! I do not hear a mouse. I see some bursting buds appear; I hear God in his garden,—hear Him trim some flowers for His house. I hear some singing stars; the mouth Of my vast river sings and sings, And pipes on reeds of pleasant things,— Of splendid promise for my South: My great South-woman, soon to rise And tiptoe up and loose her hair; Tiptoe, and take from out the skies God's stars and glorious moon to wear! I The poet shall create or kill, Bid heroes live, bid braggarts die. I look against a lurid sky,— My silent South lies proudly still. The fading light of burning lands Still climbs to God's house overhead; Mute women wring white, withered hands; Their eyes are red, their skies are red. And we still boast our bitter wars! Still burn and boast, and boast and lie But God's white finger spins the stars In calm dominion of the sky. And not one ray of light the less Comes down to bid the grasses spring; No drop of dew nor anything Shall fail for all our bitterness. If man grows large, is God the less? The moon shall rise and set the same, The great sun spill his splendid flame, And clothe the world in queenliness. Yea, from that very blood-soaked sod Some large-souled, seeing youth shall come Some day, and he shall not be dumb Before the awful court of God. II The weary moon had turned away, The far North Star was turning pale To hear the stranger's boastful tale Of blood and flame that battle-day. And yet again the two men glared, Close face to face above that tomb; Each seemed as jealous of the room The other, eager waiting shared. Again the man began to say,— As taking up some broken thread, As talking to the patient dead,— The Creole was as still as they: “That night we burned yon grass-grown town,— The grasses, vines are reaching up; The ruins they are reaching down, As sun-browned soldiers when they sup. “I knew her,—knew her constancy. She said this night of every year She here would come, and kneeling here, Would pray the livelong night for me. “This praying seems a splendid thing! It drives old Time the other way; It makes him lose all reckoning Of years that I have had to pay. “This praying seems a splendid thing! It makes me stronger as she prays— But oh, those bitter, bitter days, When I became a banished thing! “I fled, took ship,—I fled as far As far ships drive tow'rd the North Star: For I did hate the South, the sun That made me think what I had done. “I could not see a fair palm-tree In foreign land, in pleasant place, But it would whisper of her face And shake its keen, sharp blades at me. “Each black-eyed woman would recall A lone church-door, a face, a name, A coward's flight, a soldier's shame: I fled from woman's face, from all. “I hugged my gold, my precious gold, Within my strong, stout buckskin vest. I wore my bags against my breast So close I felt my heart grow cold. “I did not like to see it now; I did not spend one single piece; I traveled, traveled without cease As far as Russian ship could plow. “And when my own scant hoard was gone, And I had reached the far North-land, I took my two stout bags in hand As one pursued, and journeyed on. “Ah, I was weary! I grew gray; I felt the fast years slip and reel, As slip bright beads when maidens kneel At altars when outdoor is gay. “At last I fell prone in the road,— Fell fainting with my cursed load. A skin-clad Cossack helped me bear My bags, nor would one shilling share. “He looked at me with proud disdain,— He looked at me as if he knew; His black eyes burned me thro' and thro'; His scorn pierced like a deadly pain. “He frightened me with honesty; He made me feel so small, so base, I fled, as if a fiend kept chase,— A fiend that claimed my company! “I bore my load alone; I crept Far up the steep and icy way; And there, before a cross there lay A barefoot priest, who bowed and wept. “I threw my gold right down and sped Straight on. And oh, my heart was light! A springtime bird in springtime flight Flies scarce more happy than I fled. “I felt somehow this monk would take My gold, my load from off my back; Would turn the fiend from off my track, Would take my gold for sweet Christ's sake! “I fled; I did not look behind; I fled, fled with the mountain wind. At last, far down the mountain's base I found a pleasant resting-place. “I rested there so long, so well, More grateful than all tongues can tell. It was such pleasant thing to hear That valley's voices calm and clear: “That valley veiled in mountain air, With white goats on the hills at morn; That valley green with seas of corn, With cottage-islands here and there. “I watched the mountain girls. The hay They mowed was not more sweet than they; They laid brown hands in my white hair; They marveled at my face of care. “I tried to laugh; I could but weep. I made these peasants one request,— That I with them might toil or rest, And with them sleep the long, last sleep. “I begged that I might battle there, In that fair valley-land, for those Who gave me cheer, when girt with foes, And have a country loved as fair. “Where is that spot that poets name Our country? name the hallowed land? Where is that spot where man must stand Or fall when girt with sworn and flame? “Where is that one permitted spot? Where is the one place man must fight? Where rests the one God-given right To fight, as ever patriots fought? “I say 'tis in that holy house Where God first set us down on earth; Where mother welcomed us at birth, And bared her breasts, a happy spouse. “The simple plowboy from his field Looks forth. He sees God's purple wall Encircling him. High over all The vast sun wheels his shining shield. “This King, who makes earth what it is,— King David bending to his toil! O Lord and master of the soil, How envied in thy loyal bliss! “Long live the land we loved in youth That world with blue skies bent about, Where never entered ugly doubt! Long live the simple, homely truth! “Can true hearts love some far snow-land, Some bleak Alaska bought with gold? God's laws are old as love is old; And Home is something near at hand. “Yea, change yon river's course; estrange The seven sweet stars; make hate divide The full moon from the flowing tide,— But this old truth ye cannot change. “I begged a land as begging bread; I begged of these brave mountaineers To share their sorrows, share their tears; To weep as they wept with their dead. “They did consent. The mountain town Was mine to love, and valley lands. That night the barefoot monk came down And laid my two bags in my hands! “On! on! And oh, the load I bore! Why, once I dreamed my soul was lead; Dreamed once it was a body dead! It made my cold, hard bosom sore. “I dragged that body forth and back— O conscience, what a baying hound! Nor frozen seas nor frosted ground Can throw this bloodhound from his track. “In farthest Russia I lay down, A dying man, at last to rest; I felt such load upon my breast As seamen feel, who, sinking, drown. “That night, all chill and desperate, I sprang up, for I could not rest; I tore the two bags from my breast, And dashed them in the burning grate. “I then crept back into my bed; I tried, I begged, I prayed to sleep; But those red, restless coins would keep Slow dropping, dropping, and blood-red. “I heard them clink, and clink, and clink,— They turned, they talked within that grate. They talked of her; they made me think Of one who still did pray and wait. “And when the bags burned crisp and black, Two coins did start, roll to the floor,— Roll out, roll on, and then roll back, As if they needs must journey more. “Ah, then I knew nor change nor space, Nor all the drowning years that rolled Could hide from me her haunting face, Nor still that red-tongued, talking gold! “Again I sprang forth from my bed! I shook as in an ague fit; I clutched that red gold, burning red, I clutched as if to strangle it. “I clutched it up—you hear me, boy?— I clutched it up with joyful tears! I clutched it close with such wild joy I had not felt for years and years! “Such joy! for I should now retrace My steps, should see my land, her face; Bring back her gold this battle-day, And see her, hear her, hear her pray! “I brought it back—you hear me, boy? I clutch it, hold it, hold it now; Red gold, bright gold that giveth joy To all, and anywhere or how; “That giveth joy to all but me,— To all but me, yet soon to all. It burns my hands, it burns! but she Shall ope my hands and let it fall. “For oh, I have a willing hand To give these bags of gold; to see Her smile as once she smiled on me Here in this pleasant warm palm-land.” He ceased, he thrust each hard-clenched fist,— He threw his gold hard forth again, As one impelled by some mad pain He would not or could not resist. The Creole, scorning, turned away, As if he turned from that lost thief,— The one who died without belief That dark, dread crucifixion day. III Believe in man nor turn away. Lo! man advances year by year; Time bears him upward, and his sphere Of life must broaden day by day. Believe in man with large belief; The garnered grain each harvest-time Hath promise, roundness, and full prime For all the empty chaff and sheaf. Believe in man with brave belief; Truth keeps the bottom of her well; And when the thief peeps down, the thief Peeps back at him perpetual. Faint not that this or that man fell; For one that falls a thousand rise To lift white Progress to the skies: Truth keeps the bottom of her well. Fear not for man, nor cease to delve For cool, sweet truth, with large belief. Lo! Christ himself chose only twelve, Yet one of these turned out a thief. IV Down through the dark magnolia leaves, Where climbs the rose of Cherokee Against the orange-blossomed tree, A loom of morn-light weaves and weaves,— A loom of morn-light, weaving clothes From snow-white rose of Cherokee, And bridal blooms of orange-tree, For fairy folk housed in red rose. Down through the mournful myrtle crape, Thro' moving moss, thro' ghostly gloom, A long, white morn-beam takes a shape Above a nameless, lowly tomb; A long white finger through the gloom Of grasses gathered round about,— As God's white finger pointing out A name upon that nameless tomb. V Her white face bowed in her black hair, The maiden prays so still within That you might hear a falling pin,— Aye, hear her white, unuttered prayer. The moon has grown disconsolate, Has turned her down her walk of stars: Why, she is shutting up her bars, As maidens shut a lover's gate. The moon has grown disconsolate; She will no longer watch and wait. But two men wait; and two men will Wait on till full morn, mute and still. Still wait and walk among the trees Quite careless if the moon may keep Her walk along her starry steep Or drown her in the Southern seas. They know no moon, or set or rise Of sun, or anything to light The earth or skies, save her dark eyes, This praying, waking, watching night. They move among the tombs apart, Their eyes turn ever to that door; They know the worn walks there by heart— They turn and walk them o'er and o'er. They are not wide, these little walks For dead folk by this crescent town: They lie right close when they lie down, As if they kept up quiet talks. VI The two men keep their paths apart; But more and more begins to stoop The man with gold, as droop and droop Tall plants with something at their heart. Now once again, with eager zest, He offers gold with silent speech; The other will not walk in reach, But walks around, as round a pest. His dark eyes sweep the scene around, His young face drinks the fragrant air, His dark eyes journey everywhere,— The other's cleave unto the ground. It is a weary walk for him, For oh, he bears such weary load! He does not like that narrow road Between the dead—it is so dim: It is so dark, that narrow place, Where graves lie thick, like yellow leaves: Give us the light of Christ and grace; Give light to garner in the sheaves. Give light of love; for gold is cold,— Aye, gold is cruel as a crime; It gives no light at such sad time As when man's feet wax weak and old. Aye, gold is heavy, hard, and cold! And have I said this thing before? Well, I will say it o'er and o'er, 'T were need be said ten thousand fold. “Give us this day our daily bread,”— Get this of God; then all the rest Is housed in thine own earnest breast, If you but lift an honest head. VII Oh, I have seen men tall and fair, Stoop down their manhood with disgust,— Stoop down God's image to the dust, To get a load of gold to bear: Have seen men selling day by day The glance of manhood that God gave: To sell God's image, as a slave Might sell some little pot of clay! Behold! here in this green graveyard A man with gold enough to fill A coffin, as a miller's till; And yet his path is hard, so hard! His feet keep sinking in the sand, And now so near an opened grave! He seems to hear the solemn wave Of dread oblivion at hand. The sands, they grumble so, it seems As if he walks some shelving brink; He tries to stop, he tries to think, He tries to make believe he dreams: Why, he was free to leave the land,— The silver moon was white as dawn; Why, he had gold in either hand, Had silver ways to walk upon. And who should chide, or bid him stay? Or taunt, or threat, or bid him fly? “The world's for sale,” I hear men say, And yet this man had gold to buy. Buy what? Buy rest? He could not rest! Buy gentle sleep? He could not sleep, Though all these graves were wide and deep As their wide mouths with the request. Buy Love, buy faith, buy snow-white truth? Buy moonlight, sunlight, present, past? Buy but one brimful cup of youth That true souls drink of to the last? O God! 'twas pitiful to see This miser so forlorn and old! O God! how poor a man may be With nothing in this world but gold! VIII The broad magnolia's blooms were white; Her blooms were large, as if the moon Quite lost her way that dreamful night, And lodged to wait the afternoon. Oh, vast white blossoms, breathing love! White bosom of my lady dead, In your white heaven overhead I look, and learn to look above. IX The dew-wet roses wept; their eyes All dew, their breath as sweet as prayer. And as they wept, the dead down there Did feel their tears and hear their sighs. The grass uprose, as if afraid Some stranger foot might press too near; Its every blade was like a spear, Its every spear a living blade. The grass above that nameless tomb Stood all arrayed, as if afraid Some weary pilgrim, seeking room And rest, might lay where she was laid. X 'T was morn, and yet it was not morn; 'T was morn in heaven, not on earth: A star was singing of a birth,— Just saying that a day was born. The marsh hard by that bound the lake,— The great stork sea-lake, Ponchartrain, Shut off from sultry Cuban main,— Drew up its legs, as half awake: Drew long, thin legs, stork-legs that steep In slime where alligators creep,— Drew long, green legs that stir the grass, As when the lost, lorn night winds pass. Then from the marsh came croakings low Then louder croaked some sea-marsh beast; Then, far away against the east, God's rose of morn began to grow. From out the marsh against that east, A ghostly moss-swept cypress stood; With ragged arms, above the wood It rose, a God-forsaken beast. It seemed so frightened where it rose! The moss-hung thing, it seemed to wave The worn-out garments of a grave,— To wave and wave its old grave-clothes. Close by, a cow rose up and lowed From out a palm-thatched milking-shed; A black boy on the river road Fled sudden, as the night had fled: A nude black boy,—a bit of night That had been broken off and lost From flying night, the time it crossed The soundless river in its flight. A bit of darkness, following The sable night on sable wing,— A bit of darkness, dumb with fear, Because that nameless tomb was near. Then holy bells came pealing out; Then steamboats blew, then horses neighed; Then smoke from hamlets round about Crept out, as if no more afraid. Then shrill cocks here, and shrill cocks there Stretched glossy necks and filled the air;— How many cocks it takes to make A country morning well awake! Then many boughs, with many birds,— Young boughs in green, old boughs in gray; These birds had very much to say, In their soft, sweet, familiar words. And all seemed sudden glad; the gloom Forgot the church, forgot the tomb; And yet, like monks with cross and bead, The myrtles leaned to read and read. And oh, the fragrance of the sod! And oh, the perfume of the air! The sweetness, sweetness everywhere, That rose like incense up to God! I like a cow's breath in sweet spring; I like the breath of babes new-born; A maid's breath is a pleasant thing,— But oh, the breath of sudden morn!— Of sudden morn, when every pore Of Mother Earth is pulsing fast With life, and life seems spilling o'er With love, with love too sweet to last: Of sudden morn beneath the sun, By God's great river wrapped in gray, That for a space forgets to run, And hides his face, as if to pray. XI The black-eyed Creole kept his eyes Turned to the door, as eyes might turn To see the holy embers burn Some sin away at sacrifice. Full dawn! but yet he knew no dawn, Nor song of bird, nor bird on wing, Nor breath of rose, nor anything Her fair face lifted not upon. And yet he taller stood with morn; His bright eyes, brighter than before, Burned fast against that favored door, His proud lips lifting still with scorn,— With lofty, silent scorn for one Who all night long had plead and plead, With none to witness but the dead How he for gold had been undone. O ye who feed a greed for gold And barter truth, and trade sweet youth For cold, hard gold, behold, behold! Behold this man! behold this truth! Why what is there in all God's plan Of vast creation, high or low, By sea or land, by sun or snow, So mean, so miserly as man? Lo, earth and heaven all let go Their garnered riches, year by year! The treasures of the trackless snow, Ah, hast thou seen how very dear? The wide earth gives, gives golden grain, Gives fruits of gold, gives all, gives all! Hold forth your hand, and these shall fall In your full palm as free as rain. Yea, earth is generous. The trees Strip nude as birth-time without fear; And their reward is year by year To feel their fullness but increase. The law of Nature is to give, To give, to give! and to rejoice In giving with a generous voice, And so trust God and truly live. But see this miser at the last,— This man who loved, who worshipped gold, Who grasped gold with such eager hold, He fain must hold forever fast: As if to hold what God lets go; As if to hold, while all around Lets go and drops upon the ground All things as generous as snow. Let go your hold! let go or die! Let go poor soul! Do not refuse Till death comes by and shakes you loose, And sends you shamed to hell for aye! What if the sun should keep his gold? The rich moon lock her silver up? What if the gold-clad buttercup Became such miser, mean and old? Ah, me! the coffins are so true In all accounts, the shrouds so thin That down there you might sew and sew, Nor ever sew one pocket in. And all that you can hold of lands Down there, below the grass, down there, Will only be that little share You hold in your two dust-full hands. XII She comes! she comes! The stony floor Speaks out! And now the rusty door At last has just one word this day, With mute, religious lips, to say. She comes! she comes! And lo, her face Is upward, radiant, fair as prayer! So pure here in this holy place, Where holy peace is everywhere. Her upraised face, her face of light And loveliness, from duty done, Is like a rising orient sun That pushes back the brow of night. How brave, how beautiful is truth! Good deeds untold are like to this. But fairest of all fair things is A pious maiden in her youth: A pious maiden as she stands Just on the threshold of the years That throb and pulse with hopes and fears, And reaches God her helpless hands. How fair is she! How fond is she! Her foot upon the threshold there. Her breath is as a blossomed tree,— This maiden mantled in her hair! Her hair, her black abundant hair, Where night inhabited, all night And all this day, will not take flight, But finds content and houses there. Her hands are clasped, her two small hands: They hold the holy book of prayer Just as she steps the threshold there, Clasped downward where she silent stands. XIII Once more she lifts her lowly face, And slowly lifts her large, dark eyes Of wonder, and in still surprise She looks full forward in her place. She looks full forward on the air Above the tomb, and yet below The fruits of gold, the blooms of snow, As looking—looking anywhere. She feels—she knows not what she feels: It is not terror, is not fear. But there is something that reveals A presence that is near and dear. She does not let her eyes fall down, They lift against the far profound: Against the blue above the town Two wide-winged vultures circle round. Two brown birds swim above the sea,— Her large eyes swim as dreamily, And follow far, and follow high, Two circling black specks in the sky. One forward step,—the closing door Creaks out, as frightened or in pain; Her eyes are on the ground again— Two men are standing close before. “My love,” sighs one, “my life, my all!” Her lifted foot across the sill Sinks down,—and all things are so still You hear the orange-blossoms fall. But fear comes not where duty is, And purity is peace and rest; Her cross is close upon her breast, Her two hands clasp hard hold of this. Her two hands clasp cross, book, and she Is strong in tranquil purity,— Aye, strong as Samson when he laid His two hands forth and bowed and prayed. One at her left, one at her right, And she between the steps upon,— I can but see that Syrian night, The women there at early dawn. XIV The sky is like an opal sea, The air is like the breath of kine; But oh, her face is white, and she Leans faint to see a lifted sign,— To see two hands lift up and wave,— To see a face so white with woe, So ghastly, hollow, white as though It had that moment left the grave. Her sweet face at that ghostly sign, Her fair face in her weight of hair, Is like a white dove drowning there,— A white dove drowned in Tuscan wine. He tries to stand, to stand erect; 'T is gold, 't is gold that holds him down! And soul and body both must drown,— Two millstones tied about his neck. Now once again his piteous face Is raised to her face reaching there He prays such piteous silent prayer, As prays a dying man for grace. It is not good to see him strain To lift his hands, to gasp, to try To speak. His parched lips are so dry Their sight is as a living pain, I think that rich man down in hell Some like this old man with his gold,— To gasp and gasp perpetual, Like to this minute I have told. XV At last the miser cries his pain,— A shrill, wild cry, as if a grave Just op'd its stony lips and gave One sentence forth, then closed again. “'T was twenty years last night, last night!” His lips still moved, but not to speak; His outstretched hands, so trembling weak, Were beggar's hands in sorry plight. His face upturned to hers; his lips Kept talking on, but gave no sound; His feet were cloven to the ground; Like iron hooks his finger tips. “Aye, twenty years,” she sadly sighed; “I promised mother every year, That I would pray for father here, As she still prayed the night she died: “To pray as she prayed, fervently, As she had promised she would pray The sad night that he turned away, For him, wherever he might be.” Then she was still; then sudden she Let fall her eyes, and so outspake, As if her very heart would break, Her proud lips trembling piteously: “And whether he comes soon or late To kneel beside this nameless grave, May God forgive my father's hate As I forgive, as she forgave!” He saw the stone; he understood, With that quick knowledge that will come Most quick when men are made most dumb With terror that stops still the blood. And then a blindness slowly fell On soul and body; but his hands Held tight his bags, two iron bands, As if to bear them into hell. He sank upon the nameless stone With oh! such sad, such piteous moan As never man might seek to know From man's most unforgiving foe. He sighed at last, so long, so deep, As one heart breaking in one's sleep,— One long, last, weary, willing sigh, As if it were a grace to die. And then his hands, like loosened bands, Hung down, hung down, on either side; His hands hung down, hung open wide: Wide empty hung the dead man's hands. RESURGO SAN FRANCISCO This tall, strong City stands today The fairest, comeliest fashionings Of marble, granite, concrete, clay That ever fell from human hand; That ever flourished sea or land, Or wooed the sea-world's wide white-wings. This concrete City stands today, The newest, truest, man has wrought; The kindest, cleanest, strongest, yea Twice strongest City, deed or thought, Thrice strongest ever lost or won— Thrice strongest wall, without, within That is or ever yet has been Beneath the broad path of the Sun. Behold her Seven Hills loom white Once more as marble-builded Rome. Her marts teem with a touch of home And music fills her halls at night; Her streets flow populous, and light Floods every happy, hopeful face; The wheel of fortune whirls apace And old-time fare and dare hold sway. Farewell the blackened, toppling wall, The bent steel gird, the somber pall— Farewell forever, let us pray; Farewell forever and a day! How beauteous her lifted brow! How heartfelt her harmonious song! How strong her heart, how more than strong She stands rewrought, refashioned now! Her concrete bastions, knit with steel, Sing symphonies in stately forms, Make harmonies that mock at storms, Make music that you can but feel. And yet, and yet what ropes of sand, What wisps of straw in God's right hand— And yet, my risen city, yet Your prophets must not now forget: Must not forget how you laid hold This whole west world as all your own— How sat this sea-bank as a throne, How strewed these very streets with gold, How laid hard tribute, land and sea, Heaped silver, gold incessantly! The simple Mexicans' broad lands You coveted, thrust forth both hands, Then bade Ramona plead her cause In unknown language, unknown laws! You robbed her, robbed her without shame: Ay, even of her virtuous name! Nor shall your prophets now forget, Now that you stand sublimely strong, How when these vast estates were set With granaries that burst in song, You spurned the heathen at your feet Because he begged to toil to eat; Because he plead with bended head For work, for work and barely bread. Yea, how you laughed his lack of pride, And lied and laughed, and laughed and lied And mocked him, in your pride and hate, Then in his gaunt face banged your Gate! Nay, not forget, now that you rise Triumphant, strong as Abram's song, How that you lied the lie of lies And wrought the Nipponese such wrong, Then sent your convict chief to plead The President expel them hence. Ah me, what black, rank insolence! What rank, black infamy indeed! Because their ways, their hands were clean, You feared the difference between, Feared they might surely be preferred Above your howling, convict herd! Their sober, sane life put to shame Your noisome, drunken penal band That howled in Labor's sacred name, Nor wrought, nor even lifted hand, Save but to stone and mock and moil Their betters who but asked to toil. Yon harvest-fields cried out as when Your country cries for fighting men, And yet your hordes, by force and fraud, Forbade this first, last law of God! And you? You sat supinely by And gathered gold, nor reckoned why! Your great, proud men heaped gold on gold; They heaped deep cellars with such hoard Of costliest wines, rich, rare, and old As never Thebes or Babel stored— They sat at wine till ghostly dawn. ... The ides had come but had not gone; For lo! the writing on the wall And then the surge, the topple, fall— Then dust, then darkness, then such light As never yet lit day or night, And there was neither night nor day, For night and day were burned away! Hear me once more, my city, heed! I may not kiss again your tears Nor point your drunken, grasping greed, For I am stricken well with years, But do ye as you erst have done, Despise His daughter, mock His son— If still the sow her wallow keeps And wine runs as a rivulet, My harp hangs where the willow weeps. Nay, nay, I must not now forget The sin, the shame, the feast, the fall, The red handwriting on the wall. Then let me not behold once more Your flowing cellars, mile on mile, A sea of flame without a shore Or even one lone, lifted isle. Let me not hear it, feel it choke, A wild beast choking in his chain The while he tugs and leaps in vain And drinks his death of flaming smoke. Spare me this nightmare, pray you spare This black three days of blank despair! Spare me this red-black, surging sea Of leaping, choking agony. I call one witness, only one, In proof that God is God, and just: Yon high-heaved dome, débris and dust. With torn lips lifted to the sun, In desolation still, lords all— The rent and ruined City Hall. And here throbbed San Francisco's heart, And here her madness held high mart— Sold justice, sold black shame, sold hell. And here, right here, God's high hand fell, Fell hardest, hottest, first, and worst— Your huge high Hall, the most accurst! Therefore I say tempt not the fates. Love meekness more, love folly less. The stranger housed within thy gates Hold sacred in his lowlyness. That pride which runs before a fall— Behold God's Angels fell from pride! And He, the lowly crucified? Ye would have stoned Him, one and all. Beware the pride of race, beware The pride of creed, long pompous prayer— Who made your High Priest higher than The humblest, honest Chinaman?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Volume Four SONGS OF ITALY AND OTHERS THE IDEAL AND THE REAL And full these truths eternal O'er the yearning spirit steal, That the real is the ideal, And the ideal is the real. She was damn'd with the dower of beauty, she Had gold in shower by shoulder and brow. Her feet!—why, her two blessed feet, were so small, They could nest in this hand. How queenly, how tall, How gracious, how grand! She was all to me,— My present, my past, my eternity! She but lives in my dreams. I behold her now By shoreless white waters that flow'd like a sea At her feet where I sat; her lips pushed out In brave, warm welcome of dimple and pout! 'Twas æons agone. By that river that ran All fathomless, echoless, limitless, on, And shoreless, and peopled with never a man, We met, soul to soul. ... No land; yet I think There were willows and lilies that lean'd to drink. The stars they were seal'd and the moons were gone. The wide shining circles that girdled that world, They were distant and dim. And an incense curl'd In vapory folds from that river that ran All shoreless, with never the presence of man. How sensuous the night; how soft was the sound Of her voice on the night! How warm was her breath In that world that had never yet tasted of death Or forbidden sweet fruit! ... In that far profound. We were camped on the edges of godland. We Were the people of Saturn. The watery fields, The wide-wing'd, dolorous birds of the sea, They acknowledged but us. Our brave battle shields Were my naked white palms; our food it was love. Our roof was the fresco of gold belts above. How turn'd she to me where that wide river ran, With its lilies and willows and watery weeds, And heeded as only a true love heeds! ... How tender she was, and how timid she was! But a black, hoofed beast, with the head of a man, Stole down where she sat at my side, and began To puff his tan cheeks, then to play, then to pause, With his double-reed pipe; then to play and to play As never played man since the world began, And never shall play till the judgment day. How he puff'd! how he play'd! Then down the dim shore, This half-devil man, all hairy and black, Did dance with his hoofs in the sand, laughing back As his song died away. ... She turned never more Unto me after that. She arose and she pass'd Right on from my sight. Then I followed as fast As true love can follow. But ever before Like a spirit she fled. How vain and how far Did I follow my beauty, red belt or white star! Through foamy white sea, unto fruit-laden shore. How long did I follow! My pent soul of fire It did feed on itself. I fasted, I cried; Was tempted by many. Yet still I denied The touch of all things, and kept my desire ... I stood by the lion of St. Mark in that hour Of Venice when gold of the sunset is roll'd From cloud to cathedral, from turret to tower, In matchless, magnificent garments of gold; Then I knew she was near; yet I had not known Her form or her face since the stars were sown. We two had been parted—God pity us!—when This world was unnamed and all heaven was dim; We two had been parted far back on the rim And the outermost border of heaven's red bars; We two had been parted ere the meeting of men, Or God had set compass on spaces as yet; We two had been parted ere God had once set His finger to spinning the purple with stars,— And now at the last in the sea and fret Of the sun of Venice, we two had met. Where the lion of Venice, with brows a-frown, With tossed mane tumbled, and teeth in air, Looks out in his watch o'er the watery town, With paw half lifted, with claw half bare, By the blue Adriatic, at her bath in the sea,— I saw her. I knew her, but she knew not me. I had found her at last! Why I, I had sail'd The antipodes through, had sought, and had hail'd All flags; I had climbed where the storm clouds curl'd, And call'd o'er the awful arch'd dome of the world. I saw her one moment, then fell back abash'd, And fill'd to the throat. ... Then I turn'd me once more, Thanking God in my soul, while the level sun flashed Happy halos about her. ... Her breast!—why, her breast Was white as twin pillows that lure you to rest. Her sloping limbs moved like to melodies told, As she rose from the sea, and threw back the gold Of her glorious hair, and set face to the shore. ... I knew her! I knew her, though we had not met Since the red stars sang to the sun's first set! How long I had sought her! I had hunger'd, nor ate Of any sweet fruits. I had followed not one Of all the fair glories grown under the sun. I had sought only her, believing that she Had come upon earth, and stood waiting for me Somewhere by my way. But the pathways of Fate They had led otherwhere; the round world round, The far North seas and the near profound Had fail'd me for aye. Now I stood by that sea Where she bathed in her beauty, ... God, I and she! I spake not, but caught in my breath; I did raise My face to fair heaven to give God praise That at last, ere the ending of Time, we had met, Had touched upon earth at the same sweet place. ... Yea, we never had met since creation at all; Never, since ages ere Adam's fall, Had we two met in that hunger and fret Where two should be one; but had wander'd through space; Through space and through spheres, as some bird that hard fate Gives a thousand glad Springs but never one mate. Was it well with my love? Was she true? Was she brave With virtue's own valor? Was she waiting for me? Oh, how fared my love? Had she home? had she bread? Had she known but the touch of the warm-temper'd wave? Was she born to this world with a crown on her head, Or born, like myself, but a dreamer instead? ... So long it had been! So long! Why, the sea— That wrinkled and surly, old, time-temper'd slave— Had been born, had his revels, grown wrinkled and hoar Since I last saw my love on that uttermost shore. Oh, how fared my love? Once I lifted my face, And I shook back my hair and look'd out on the sea; I press'd my hot palms as I stood in my place, And I cried, “Oh, I come like a king to your side Though all hell intervene!” ... “Hist! she may be a bride, A mother at peace, with sweet babes at her knee! A babe at her breast and a spouse at her side!— Had I wander'd too long, and had Destiny Sat mortal between us?” I buried my face In my hands, and I moan'd as I stood in my place. 'Twas her year to be young. She was tall, she was fair— Was she pure as the snow on the Alps over there? 'Twas her year to be young. She was queenly and tall; And I felt she was true, as I lifted my face And saw her press down her rich robe to its place, With a hand white and small as a babe's with a doll. And her feet!—why, her feet in the white shining sand Were so small, 'twas a wonder the maiden could stand. Then she push'd back her hair with a round hand that shone And flash'd in the light with a white starry stone. Then my love she is rich! My love she is fair! Is she pure as the snow on the Alps over there? She is gorgeous with wealth! “Thank God, she has bread,” I said to myself. Then I humbled my head In gratitude deep. Then I question'd me where Was her palace, her parents? What name did she bear? What mortal on earth came nearest her heart? Who touch'd the small hand till it thrilled to a smart? 'Twas her year to be young. She was rich, she was fair— Was she pure as the snow on the Alps over there? Then she loosed her rich robe that was blue like the sea, And silken and soft as a baby's new born. And my heart it leap'd light as the sunlight at morn At the sight of my love in her proud purity, As she rose like a Naiad half-robed from the sea. Then careless and calm as an empress can be She loosed and let fall all the raiment of blue, As she drew a white robe in a melody Of moving white limbs, while between the two, Like a rift in a cloud, shone her fair presence through. Soon she turn'd, reach'd a hand; then a tall gondolier Who had lean'd on his oar, like a long lifted spear Shot sudden and swift and all silently, And drew to her side as she turn'd from the tide. It was odd, such a thing, and I counted it queer That a princess like this, whether virgin or bride, Should abide thus apart as she bathed in the sea; And I chafed and I chafed, and so unsatisfied, That I flutter'd the doves that were perch'd close about, As I strode up and down in dismay and in doubt. Swift she stept in the boat on the borders of night As an angel might step on that far wonder land Of eternal sweet life, which men mis-name Death. Quick I called me a craft, and I caught at my breath As she sat in the boat, and her white baby hand Held vestments of gold to her throat, snowy white. Then her gondola shot,—shot sharp for the shore: There was never the sound of a song or of oar, But the doves hurried home in white clouds to Saint Mark, Where the brass horses plunge their high manes in the dark. Then I cried: “Follow fast! Follow fast! Follow fast! Aye! thrice double fare, if you follow her true To her own palace door!” There was plashing of oar And rattle of rowlock. ... I sat peering through, Looking far in the dark, peering out as we passed With my soul all alert, bending down, leaning low. But only the oaths of the fisherman's crew When we jostled them sharp as we sudden shot through The watery town. Then a deep, distant roar— The rattle of rowlock; the rush of the oar. The rattle of rowlock, the rush of the sea ... Swift wind like a sword at the throat of us all! I lifted my face, and far, fitfully The heavens breathed lightning; did lift and let fall As if angels were parting God's curtains. Then deep And indolent-like, and as if half asleep, As if half made angry to move at all, The thunder moved. It confronted me. It stood like an avalanche poised on a hill, I saw its black brows. I heard it stand still. The troubled sea throbb'd as if rack'd with pain. Then the black clouds arose and suddenly rode, As a fiery, fierce stallion that knows no rein Right into the town. Then the thunder strode As a giant striding from star to red star, Then turn'd upon earth and frantically came, Shaking the hollow heaven. And far And near red lightning in ribbon and skein Did seam and furrow the cloud with flame, And write on black heaven Jehovah's name. Then lightning's came weaving like shuttle-cocks, Weaving red robes of black clouds for death. And frightened doves fluttered them home in flocks, And mantled men hied them with gather'd breath. Black gondolas scattered as never before, And drew like crocodiles up on the shore; And vessels at sea stood further at sea, And seamen haul'd with a bended knee, And canvas came down to left and right, Till ships stood stripp'd as if stripp'd for fight! Then an oath. Then a prayer. Then a gust, with rents Through the yellow-sail'd fishers. Then suddenly Came sharp fork'd fire! Then again thunder fell Like the great first gun. Ah, then there was rout Of ships like the breaking of regiments, And shouts as if hurled from an upper hell. Then tempest! It lifted, it spun us about, Then shot us ahead through the hills of the sea As a great steel arrow shot shoreward in wars— Then the storm split open till I saw the blown stars. On on! through the foam! through the storm! through the town! She was gone! She was lost in that wilderness Of leprous white palaces. ... Black distress! I stood in my gondola. All up and all down We pushed through the surge of the salt-flood street Above and below. ... 'Twas only the beat Of the sea's sad heart. ... I leaned, listened; I sat ... 'Twas only the water-rat; nothing but that; Not even the sea-bird screaming distress, As she lost her way in that wilderness. I listen'd all night. I caught at each sound; I clutch'd and I caught as a man that drown'd— Only the sullen, low growl of the sea Far out the flood-street at the edge of the ships; Only the billow slow licking his lips, A dog that lay crouching there watching for me,— Growling and showing white teeth all the night; Only a dog, and as ready to bite; Only the waves with their salt-flood tears Fretting white stones of a thousand years. And then a white dome in the loftiness Of cornice and cross and of glittering spire That thrust to heaven and held the fire Of the thunder still; the bird's distress As he struck his wings in that wilderness, On marbles that speak, and thrill, and inspire,— The night below and the night above; The water-rat building, the sea-lost dove; That one lost, dolorous, lone bird's call, The water-rat building,—but that was all. Silently, slowly, still up and still down, We row'd and we row'd for many an hour, By beetling palace and toppling tower, In the darks and the deeps of the watery town. Only the water-rat building by stealth, Only the lone bird astray in his flight That struck white wings in the clouds of night, On spires that sprang from Queen Adria's wealth; Only one sea dove, one lost white dove: The blackness below, the blackness above! Then, pushing the darkness from pillar to post, The morning came sullen and gray like a ghost Slow up the canal. I lean'd from the prow, And listen'd. Not even that dove in distress Crying its way through the wilderness; Not even the stealthy old water-rat now, Only the bell in the fisherman's tower, Slow tolling at sea and telling the hour, To kneel to their sweet Santa Barbara For tawny fishers at sea, and to pray. High over my head, carved cornice, quaint spire. And ancient built palaces knock'd their gray brows Together and frown'd. Then slow-creeping scows Scraped the walls on each side. Above me the fire Of a sudden-born morning came flaming in bars; While up through the chasm I could count the stars. Oh, pity! Such ruin! The dank smell of death Crept up the canal: I could scarce take my breath! 'Twas the fit places for pirates, for women who keep Contagion of body and soul where they sleep. ... God's pity! A white hand now beckoned me From an old mouldy door, almost in my reach. I sprang to the sill as one wrecked to a beach; I sprang with wide arms: it was she! it was she! ... And in such a damn'd place! And what was her trade? To think I had follow'd so faithful, so far From eternity's brink, from star to white star, To find her, to find her, nor wife nor sweet maid! To find her a shameless poor creature of shame, A nameless, lost body, men hardly dared name. All alone in her shame, on that damp dismal floor She stood to entice me. ... I bow'd me before All-conquering beauty. I call'd her my Queen! I told her my love as I proudly had told My love had I found her as pure as pure gold. I reach'd her my hands, as fearless, as clean, As man fronting cannon. I cried, “Hasten forth To the sun! There are lands to the south, to the north, Anywhere where you will. Dash the shame from your brow; Come with me, for ever; and come with me now!” Why, I'd have turn'd pirate for her, would have seen Ships burn'd from the seas, like to stubble from field. Would I turn from her now? Why should I now yield, When she needed me most? Had I found her a queen, And beloved by the world,—why, what had I done? I had woo'd, and had woo'd, and had woo'd till I won! Then, if I had loved her with gold and fair fame, Would not I now love her, and love her the same? My soul hath a pride. I would tear out my heart And cast it to dogs, could it play a dog's part! “Don't you know me, my bride of the wide world of yore? Why, don't you remember the white milky-way Of stars, that we traversed the æons before? ... We were counting the colors, we were naming the seas Of the vaster ones. You remember the trees That swayed in the cloudy white heavens, and bore Bright crystals of sweets, and the sweet mannadew? Why, you smile as you weep, you remember, and you, You know me! You know me! You know me! Yea, You know me as if 'twere but yesterday! I told her all things. Her brow took a frown; Her grand Titan beauty, so tall, so serene, The one perfect woman, mine own idol queen— Her proud swelling bosom, it broke up and down As she spake, and she shook in her soul as she said, With her small hands held to her bent, aching head: “Go back to the world! Go back, and alone Till kind Death comes and makes white as his own.” I said: “I will wait! I will wait in the pass Of death, until Time he shall break his glass.” Then I cried, “Yea, here where the gods did love, Where the white Europa was won,—she rode Her milk-white bull through these same warm seas,— Yea, here in the land where huge Hercules, With the lion's heart and the heart of the dove, Did walk in his naked great strength, and strode In the sensuous air with his lion's skin Flapping and fretting his knotted thews; Where Theseus did wander, and Jason cruise,— Yea, here let the life of all lives begin. “Yea! Here where the Orient balms breathe life, Where heaven is kindest, where all God's blue Seems a great gate open'd to welcome you, Come, rise and go forth, my empress, my wife.” Then spake her great soul, so grander far Than I had believed on that outermost star; And she put by her tears, and calmly she said, With hands still held to her bended head: “I will go through the doors of death and wait For you on the innermost side death's gate. “Thank God that this life is but a day's span, But a wayside inn for weary, worn man— A night and a day; and, tomorrow, the spell Of darkness is broken. Now, darling, farewell!” I caught at her robe as one ready to die— “Nay, touch not the hem of my robe—it is red With sins that your cruel sex heap'd on my head! Now turn you, yes, turn! But remember how I Wait weeping, in sackcloth, the while I wait Inside death's door, and watch at the gate.” I cried yet again, how I cried, how I cried, Reaching face, reaching hands as a drowning man might. She drew herself back, put my two hands aside, Half turned as she spoke, as one turned to the night: Speaking low, speaking soft as a wind through the wall Of a ruin where mold and night masters all; “I shall live my day, live patient on through The life that man hath compelled me to, Then turn to my mother, sweet earth, and pray She keep me pure to the Judgment Day! I shall sit and wait as you used to do, Will wait the next life, through the whole life through. I shall sit all alone, I shall wait alway; I shall wait inside of the gate for you, Waiting, and counting the days as I wait; Yea, wait as that beggar that sat by the gate Of Jerusalem, waiting the Judgment Day.” A DOVE OF ST. MARK O terrible lion of tame Saint Mark! Tamed old lion with the tumbled mane Tossed to the clouds and lost in the dark, With teeth in the air and tail-whipp'd back, Foot on the Bible as if thy track Led thee the lord of the desert again Say, what of thy watch o'er the watery town? Say, what of the worlds walking up and down? O silent old monarch that tops Saint Mark, That sat thy throne for a thousand years, That lorded the deep that defied all men,— Lo! I see visions at sea in the dark; And I see something that shines like tears, And I hear something that sounds like sighs, And I hear something that seems as when A great soul suffers and sinks and dies. The high-born, beautiful snow came down, Silent and soft as the terrible feet Of time on the mosses of ruins. Sweet Was the Christmas time in the watery town. 'Twas full flood carnival swell'd the sea Of Venice that night, and canal and quay Were alive with humanity. Man and maid, Glad in mad revel and masquerade, Moved through the feathery snow in the night, And shook black locks as they laugh'd outright. From Santa Maggiore, and to and fro, And ugly and black as if devils cast out, Black streaks through the night of such soft, white snow, The steel-prow'd gondolas paddled about; There was only the sound of the long oars dip, As the low moon sail'd up the sea like a ship In a misty morn. High the low moon rose, Rose veil'd and vast, through the feathery snows, As a minstrel stept silent and sad from his boat, His worn cloak clutched in his hand to his throat. Low under the lion that guards St. Mark, Down under wide wings on the edge of the sea In the dim of the lamps, on the rim of the dark, Alone and sad in the salt-flood town, Silent and sad and all sullenly, He sat by the column where the crocodile Keeps watch o'er the wave, far mile upon mile. ... Like a signal light through the night let down, Then a far star fell through the dim profound— A jewel that slipp'd God's hand to the ground. The storm had blown over! Now up and then down, Alone and in couples, sweet women did pass, Silent and dreamy, as if seen in a glass, Half mask'd to the eyes, in their Adrian town. Such women! It breaks one's heart to think. Water! and never one drop to drink! What types of Titian! What glory of hair! How tall as the sisters of Saul! How fair! Sweet flowers of flesh, and all blossoming, As if 'twere in Eden, and in Eden's spring. “They are talking aloud with eloquent eyes, Yet passing me by with never one word. O pouting sweet lips, do you know there are lies That are told with the eyes, and never once heard Above a heart's beat when the soul is stirr'd? It is time to fly home, O doves of St. Mark! Take boughs of the olive; bear these to your ark, And rest and be glad, for the seas and the skies Of Venice are fair. ... What! wouldn't go home? What! drifting, and drifting as the soil'd sea-foam? “And who then are you? You, masked and so fair? Your half seen face is a rose full blown, Down under your black and abundant hair? ... A child of the street, and unloved and alone! Unloved; and alone? ... There is something then Between us two that is not unlike! ... The strength and the purposes of men Fall broken idols. We aim and strike With high-born zeal and with proud intent. Yet let life turn on some accident. ... “Nay, I'll not preach. Time's lessons pass Like twilight's swallows. They chirp in their flight, And who takes heed of the wasting glass? Night follows day, and day follows night, And no thing rises on earth but to fall Like leaves, with their lessons most sad and fit. They are spread like a volume each year to all; Yet men or women learn naught of it, Or after it all but a weariness Of soul and body and untold distress. “Yea, sit, lorn child, by my side, and we, We will talk of the world. Nay, let my hand Fall kindly to yours, and so, let your face Fall fair to my shoulder, and you shall be My dream of sweet Italy. Here in this place, Alone in the crowds of this old careless land, I shall shelter your form till the morn and then— Why, I shall return to the world and to men, And you, not stain'd for one strange, kind word And my three last francs, for a lorn night bird. “Fear nothing from me, nay, never once fear. The day, my darling, comes after the night. The nights they were made to show the light Of the stars in heaven, though the storms be near. ... Do you see that figure of Fortune up there, That tops the Dogana with toe a-tip Of the great gold ball? Her scroll is a-trip To the turning winds. She is light as the air. Her foot is set upon plenty's horn, Her fair face set to the coming morn. “Well, trust we to Fortune. ... Bread on the wave Turns ever ashore to the hand that gave. What am I? A poet—a lover of all That is lovely to see. Nay, naught shall befall. ... Yes, I am a failure. I plot and I plan, Give splendid advice to my fellow-man, Yet ever fall short of achievement. ... Ah me! In my lorn life's early, sad afternoon, Say, what have I left but a rhyme or a rune? An empty frail hand for some soul at sea, Some fair, forbidden, sweet fruit to choose, That 'twere sin to touch, and—sin to refuse? “What! I go drifting with you, girl, to-night? To sit at your side and to call you love? Well, that were a fancy! To feed a dove, A poor soil'd dove of this dear Saint Mark, Too frighten'd to rest and too weary for flight ... Aye, just three francs, my fortune. There! He Who feeds the sparrows for this will feed me. Now here 'neath the lion, alone in the dark, And side by side let us sit, poor dear, Breathing the beauty as an atmosphere. ... “We will talk of your loves, I write tales of love ... What! Cannot read? Why, you never heard then Of your Desdemona, nor the daring men Who died for her love? My poor white dove, There's a story of Shylock would drive you wild. What! Never have heard of these stories, my child? Of Tasso, of Petrarch? Not the Bridge of Sighs? Not the tale of Ferrara? Not the thousand whys That your Venice was ever adored above All other fair lands for her stories of love? “What then about Shylock? 'Twas gold. Yes—dead. The lady? 'Twas love. ... Why, yes; she too Is dead. And Byron? 'Twas fame. Ah, true ... Tasso and Petrarch? All died, just the same ... Yea, so endeth all, as you truly have said, And you, poor girl, are too wise; and you, Too sudden and swift in your hard, ugly youth, Have stumbled face fronting an obstinate truth. For whether for love, for gold, or for fame, They but lived their day, and they died the same. But let's talk not of death? Of death or the life That comes after death? 'Tis beyond your reach, And this too much thought has a sense of strife. ... Ah, true; I promised you not to preach. ... My maid of Venice, or maid unmade, Hold close your few francs and be not afraid. What! Say you are hungry? Well, let us dine Till the near morn comes on the silver shine Of the lamp-lit sea. At the dawn of day, My sad child-woman, you can go your way. “What! You have a palace? I know your town; Know every nook of it, left and right, As well as yourself. Why, far up and down Your salt flood streets, lo, many a night I have row'd and have roved in my lorn despair Of love upon earth, and I know well there Is no such palace. What! and you dare To look in my face and to lie outright, To lift your face, and to frown me down? There is no such palace in that part of the town! “You would woo me away to your rickety boat! You would pick my pockets! You would cut my throat, With help of your pirates! Then throw me out Loaded with stones to sink me down, Down into the filth and the dregs of your town! Why, that is your damnable aim, no doubt! And, my plaintive voiced child, you seem too fair, Too fair, for even a thought like that; Too fair for ever such sin to dare— Ay, even the tempter to whisper at. “Now, there is such a thing as being true, True, even in villainy. Listen to me: Black-skinn'd women and low-brow'd men, And desperate robbers and thieves; and then, Why, there are the pirates! ... Ay, pirates reform'd— Pirates reform'd and unreform'd; Pirates for me girl, friends for you,— And these are your neighbors. And so you see That I know your town, your neighbors; and I— Well, pardon me, dear—but I know you lie. “Tut, tut, my beauty! What trickery now? Why, tears through your hair on my hand like rain! Come! look in my face: laugh, lie again With your wonderful eyes. Lift up your brow, Laugh in the face of the world, and lie! Now, come! This lying is no new thing. The wearers of laces know well how to lie, As well, ay, better, than you or I. ... But they lie for fortune, for fame: instead, You, child of the street, only lie for your bread. ... “Some sounds blow in from the distant land. The bells strike sharp, and as out of tune, Some sudden, short notes. To the east and afar, And up from the sea, there is lifting a star As large, my beautiful child, and as white And as lovely to see as some lady's white hand. The people have melted away with the night, And not one gondola frets the lagoon. See! Away to the mountain, the face of morn. Hear! Away to the sea—'tis the fisherman's horn. “'Tis morn in Venice! My child, adieu! Arise, sad sister, and go your way; And as for myself, why, much like you, I shall sell the story to who will pay And dares to reckon it true and meet. Yea, each of us traders, poor child of pain; For each must barter for bread to eat In a world of trade and an age of gain; With just this difference, waif of the street, You sell your body, I sell my brain. “Poor lost little vessel, with never a keel. Saint Marks, what a wreck! Lo, here you reel, With never a soul to advise or to care; All cover'd with sin to the brows and hair, You lie like a seaweed, well a-strand; Blown like the sea-kelp hard on the shale, A half-drown'd body, with never a hand Reach'd out to help where you falter and fail: Left stranded alone to starve and to die, Or to sell your body to who may buy. “My sister of sin, I will kiss you! Yea, I will fold you, hold you close to my breast; And here as you rest in your first fair rest, As night is push'd back from the face of day, I will push your heavy, dark heaven of hair Well back from your brow, and kiss you where Your ruffian, bearded, black men of crime Have stung you and stain'd you a thousand time; I will call you my sister, sweet child, and keep You close to my heart, lest you wake but to weep. “I will tenderly kiss you, and I shall not be Ashamed, nor yet stain'd in the least, sweet dove,— I will tenderly kiss, with the kiss of Love, And of Faith, and of Hope, and of Charity. Nay, I shall be purer and be better then; For, child of the street, you, living or dead, Stain'd to the brows, are purer to me Ten thousand times than the world of men, Who reach you a hand but to lead you astray,— But the dawn is upon us. There! go your way. “And take great courage. Take courage and say, Of this one Christmas when I am away, Roving the world and forgetful of you, That I found you as white as the snow and knew You but needed a word to keep you true. When you fall weary and so need rest, Then find kind words hidden down in your breast; And if rough men question you,—why, then say That Madonna sent them. Then kneel and pray, And pray for me, the worse of the two: Then God will bless you, sweet child, and I Shall be the better when I come to die. “Yea, take great courage, it will be as bread; Have faith, have faith while this day wears through. Then rising refresh'd, try virtue instead; Be stronger and better, poor, pitiful dear, So prompt with a lie, so prompt with a tear, For the hand grows stronger as the heart grows true. ... Take courage, my child, for I promise you We are judged by our chances of life and lot; And your poor soul may yet pass through The eye of the needle, where laces shall not. “Sad dove of the dust, with tear-wet wings, Homeless and lone as the dove from its ark,— Do you reckon yon angel that tops St. Mark, That tops the tower, that tops the town, If he knew us two, if he knew all things, Would say, or think, you are worse than I? Do you reckon yon angel, now looking down, Far down like a star, he hangs so high, Could tell which one were the worse of us two? Child of the street—it is not you! “If we two were dead, and laid side by side Right here on the pavement, this very day, Here under the sun-flushed maiden sky, Where the morn flows in like a rosy tide, And the sweet Madonna that stands in the moon, With her crown of stars, just across the lagoon, Should come and should look upon you and I,— Do you reckon, my child, that she would decide As men do decide and as women do say, That you are so dreadful, and turn away? “If angels were sent to choose this day Between us two as we rest here, Here side by side in this storied place,— If angels were sent to choose, I say, This very moment the best of the two, You, white with a hunger and stain'd with a tear, Or I, the rover the wide world through, Restless and stormy as any sea,— Looking us two right straight in the face, Child of the street, he would not choose me. “The fresh sun is falling on turret and tower, The far sun is flashing on spire and dome, The marbles of Venice are bursting to flower, The marbles of Venice are flower and foam: Good night and good morn; I must leave you now. There! bear my kiss on your pale, soft brow Through earth to heaven: and when we shall meet Beyond the darkness, poor waif of the street, Why, then I shall know you, my sad, sweet dove; Shall claim you, and kiss you, with the kiss of love.” COMO The lakes lay bright as bits of broken moon Just newly set within the cloven earth; The ripen'd fields drew round a golden girth Far up the steeps, and glittered in the noon; And when the sun fell down, from leafy shore Fond lovers stole in pairs to ply the oar; The stars, as large as lilies, fleck'd the blue; From out the Alps the moon came wheeling through The rocky pass the great Napoleon knew. A gala night it was,—the season's prime. We rode from castled lake to festal town, To fair Milan—my friend and I; rode down By night, where grasses waved in rippled rhyme: And so, what theme but love at such a time? His proud lip curl'd the while with silent scorn At thought of love; and then, as one forlorn, He sigh'd; then bared his temples, dash'd with gray; Then mock'd, as one outworn and well blase. A gorgeous tiger lily, flaming red,— So full of battle, of the trumpets blare, Of old-time passion, uprear'd its head. I gallop'd past. I lean'd. I clutch'd it there From out the stormy grass. I held it high, And cried: “Lo! this to-night shall deck her hair Through all the dance. And mark! the man shall die Who dares assault, for good or ill design, The citadel where I shall set this sign.” O, she shone fairer than the summer star, Or curl'd sweet moon in middle destiny; More fair than sun-morn climbing up the sea, Where all the loves of Adriana are. ... Who loves, who truly loves, will stand aloof: The noisy tongue makes most unholy proof Of shallow passion. ... All the while afar From out the dance I stood and watched my star, My tiger lily borne, an oriflamme of war. Adown the dance she moved with matchless grace. The world—my world—moved with her. Suddenly I question'd whom her cavalier might be? 'Twas he! His face was leaning to her face! I clutch'd my blade; I sprang, I caught my breath,— And so, stood leaning cold and still as death. And they stood still. She blushed, then reach'd and tore The lily as she pass'd, and down the floor She strew'd its heart like jets of gushing gore ... 'Twas he said heads, not hearts, were made to break: He taught her this that night in splendid scorn. I learn'd too well. ... The dance was done, ere morn We mounted—he and I—but no more spake. ... And this for woman's love! My lily worn In her dark hair in pride, to then be torn And trampled on, for this bold stranger's sake! ... Two men rode silent back toward the lake; Two men rode silent down—but only one Rode up at morn to meet the rising sun. The red-clad fishers row and creep Below the crags as half asleep, Nor ever make a single sound. The walls are steep, The waves are deep; And if a dead man should be found By these same fishers in their round, Why, who shall say but he was drown'd? SUNRISE IN VENICE Night seems troubled and scarce asleep; Her brows are gather'd as in broken rest. A star in the east starts up from the deep! 'Tis morn, new-born, with a star on her breast, White as my lilies that grow in the West! Hist! men are passing me hurriedly. I see the yellow, wide wings of a bark, Sail silently over my morning star. I see men move in the moving dark, Tall and silent as columns are; Great, sinewy men that are good to see, With hair push'd back, and with open breasts; Barefooted fishermen, seeking their boats, Brown as walnuts, and hairy as goats,— Brave old water-dogs, wed to the sea, First to their labors and last to their rests. Ships are moving. I hear a horn,— Answers back, and again it calls. 'Tis the sentinel boats that watch the town All night, as mounting her watery walls, And watching for pirate or smuggler. Down Over the sea, and reaching away, And against the east, a soft light falls, Silvery soft as the mist of morn, And I catch a breath like the breath of day. The east is blossoming! Yea, a rose, Vast as the heavens, soft as a kiss, Sweet as the presence of woman is, Rises and reaches, and widens and grows Large and luminous up from the sea, And out of the sea as a blossoming tree. Richer and richer, so higher and higher, Deeper and deeper it takes its hue; Brighter and brighter it reaches through The space of heaven to the place of stars. Then beams reach upward as arms, from the sea; Then lances and arrows are aimed at me. Then lances and spangles and spars and bars Are broken and shiver'd and strown on the sea; And around and about me tower and spire Start from the billows like tongues of fire. VALE! AMERICA Let me rise and go forth. A far, dim spark Illumes my path. The light of my day Hath fled, and yet am I far away. The bright, bent moon has dipp'd her horn In the darkling sea. High up in the dark The wrinkled old lion, he looks away To the east, and impatient as if for morn. ... I have gone the girdle of earth, and say, What have I gain'd but a temple gray, Two crow's feet, and a heart forlorn? A star starts yonder like a soul afraid! It falls like a thought through the great profound. Fearfully swift and with never a sound, It fades into nothing, as all things fade; Yea, as all things fail. And where is the leaven In the pride of a name or a proud man's nod? Oh, tiresome, tiresome stairs to heaven! Weary, oh, wearysome ways to God! 'Twere better to sit with the chin on the palm, Slow tapping the sand, come storm, come calm. I have lived from within and not from without; I have drunk from a fount, have fed from a hand That no man knows who lives upon land; And yet my soul it is crying out. I care not a pin for the praise of men; But I hunger for love. I starve, I die, Each day of my life. Ye pass me by Each day, and laugh as ye pass; and when Ye come, I start in my place as ye come, And lean, and would speak,—but my lips are dumb. Yon sliding stars and the changeful moon. ... Let me rest on the plains of Lombardy for aye, Or sit down by this Adrian Sea and die. The days that do seem as some afternoon They all are here. I am strong and true To myself; can pluck and could plant anew My heart, and grow tall; could come to be Another being; lift bolder hand And conquer. Yet ever will come to me The thought that Italia is not my land. Could I but return to my woods once more, And dwell in their depths as I have dwelt, Kneel in their mosses as I have knelt, Sit where the cool white rivers run, Away from the world and half hid from the sun, Hear winds in the wood of my storm-torn shore, To tread where only the red man trod, To say no word, but listen to God! Glad to the heart with listening,— It seems to me that I then could sing, And sing as never sung man before. But deep-tangled woodland and wild waterfall, O farewell for aye, till the Judgment Day! I shall see you no more, O land of mine, O half-aware land, like a child at play! O voiceless and vast as the push'd-back skies! No more, blue seas in the blest sunshine, No more, black woods where the white peaks rise, No more, bleak plains where the high winds fall, Or the red man keeps or the shrill birds call! I must find diversion with another kind: There are roads on the land, broad roads on the sea; Take ship and sail, and sail till I find The love that I sought from eternity; Run away from oneself, take ship and sail The middle white seas; see turban'd men,— Throw thought to the dogs for aye. And when All seas are travel'd and all scenes fail, Why, then this doubtful, sad gift of verse May save me from death—or something worse. My hand it is weary, and my harp unstrung; And where is the good that I pipe or sing, Fashion new notes, or shape any thing? The songs of my rivers remain unsung Henceforward for me. ... But a man shall arise From the far, vast valleys of the Occident, With hand on a harp of gold, and with eyes That lift with glory and a proud intent; Yet so gentle indeed, that his sad heartstrings Shall thrill to the heart of your heart as he sings. Let the wind sing songs in the lake-side reeds, Lo, I shall be less than the indolent wind! Why should I sow, when I reap and bind And gather in nothing but the thistle weeds? It is best I abide, let what will befall; To rest if I can, let time roll by: Let others endeavor to learn, while I, With naught to conceal, with much to regret, Shall sit and endeavor, alone, to forget. Shall I shape pipes from these seaside reeds, And play for the children, that shout and call? Lo! men they have mock'd me the whole year through! I shall sing no more. ... I shall find in old creeds, And in quaint old tongues, a world that is new; And these, I will gather the sweets of them all. And the old-time doctrines and the old-time signs, I will taste of them all, as tasting old wines. I will find new thought, as a new-found vein Of rock-lock'd gold in my far, fair West. I will rest and forget, will entreat to be blest; Take up new thought and again grow young; Yea, take a new world as one born again, And never hear more mine own mother tongue; Nor miss it. Why should I? I never once heard, In my land's language, love's one sweet word. Did I court fame, or the favor of man? Make war upon creed, or strike hand with clan? I sang my songs of the sounding trees, As careless of name or of fame as the seas; And these I sang for the love of these, And the sad sweet solace they brought to me. I but sang for myself, touch'd here, touch'd there, As a strong-wing'd bird that flies anywhere. ... How do I wander! And yet why not? I once had a song, told a tale in rhyme; Wrote books, indeed, in my proud young prime; I aim'd at the heart like a musket ball; I struck cursed folly like a cannon shot,— And where is the glory or good of it all? Yet these did I write for my land, but this I write for myself,—and it is as it is. Yea, storms have blown counter and shaken me. And yet was I fashion'd for strife, and strong And daring of heart, and born to endure; My soul sprang upward, my feet felt sure; My faith was as wide as a wide-bough'd tree. But there be limits; and a sense of wrong Forever before you will make you less A man, than a man at first would guess. Good men can forgive—and, they say, forget. ... Far less of the angel than Indian is set In my fierce nature. And I look away To a land that is dearer than this, and say, “I shall remember, though you may forget. Yea, I shall remember for aye and a day The keen taunts thrown in a boy face, when He cried unto God for the love of men.” Enough, ay and more than enough, of this! I know that the sunshine must follow the rain; And if this be the winter, why spring again Must come in its season, full blossom'd with bliss. I will lean to the storm, though the winds blow strong. ... Yea, the winds they have blown and have shaken me— As the winds blow songs through a shattered old tree, They have blown this broken and careless set song. They have the sung this song, be it never bad; Have blown upon me and play'd upon me, Have broken the notes,—blown sad, blown glad; Just as the winds blow fierce and free A barren, a blighted, and a cursed fig tree. And if I grow careless and heed no whit Whether it please or what comes of it, Why, talk to the winds, then, and not to me. The quest of love? 'Tis the quest of troubles; 'Tis the wind through the woods of the Oregon. Sit down, sit down, for the world goes on Precisely the same; and the rainbow bubbles Of love, they gather, or break, or blow, Whether you bother your brain or no; And for all your troubles and all your tears, 'Twere just the same in a hundred years. By the populous land, or the lonesome sea, Lo! these were the gifts of the gods to men,— Three miserable gifts, and only three: To love, to forget, and to die—and then? To love in peril, and bitter-sweet pain, And then, forgotten, lie down and die: One moment of sun, whole seasons of rain, Then night is roll'd to the door of the sky. To love? To sit at her feet and to weep; To climb to her face, hide your face in her hair; To nestle you there like a babe in its sleep, And, too, like a babe, to believe—it stings there! To love! 'Tis to suffer, “Lie close to my breast, Like a fair ship in haven, O darling!” I cried. “Your round arms outreaching to heaven for rest Make signal to death.”. ... Death came, and love died. To forget? To forget, mount horse and clutch sword; Take ship and make sail to the ice-prison'd seas, Write books and preach lies; range lands; or go hoard A grave full of gold, and buy wines—and drink lees: Then die; and die cursing, and call it a prayer! Is earth but a top—a boy-god's delight, To be spun for his pleasure, while man's despair Breaks out like a wail of the damn'd through the night? Sit down in the darkness and weep with me On the edge of the world. Lo, love lies dead! And the earth and the sky, and the sky and the sea, Seem shutting together as a book that is read. Yet what have we learn'd? We laugh'd with delight In the morning at school, and kept toying with all Time's silly playthings. Now wearied ere night, We must cry for dark-mother, her cradle the pall. 'Twere better blow trumpets 'gainst love, keep away That traitorous urchin with fire or shower, Than have him come near you for one little hour. Take physic, consult with your doctor, as you Would fight a contagion; carry all through The populous day some drug that smells loud, As you pass on your way, or make way through the crowd. Talk war, or carouse; only keep off the day Of his coming, with every hard means in your way. Blow smoke in the eyes of the world, and laugh With the broad-chested men, as you loaf at your inn, As you crowd to your inn from your saddle and quaff Red wine from a horn; while your dogs at your feet, Your slim spotted dogs, like the fawn, and as fleet, Crouch patiently by and look up at your face, As they wait for the call of the horn to the chase; For you shall not suffer, and you shall not sin, Until peace goes out just as love comes in. Love horses and hounds, meet many good men— Yea, men are most proper, and keep you from care. There is strength in a horse. There is pride in his will; It is sweet to look back as you climb the steep hill. There is room. You have movement of limb; you have air, Have the smell of the wood, of the grasses; and then What comfort to rest, as you lie thrown full length All night and alone, with your fists full of strength! Go away, go away with your bitter-sweet pain Of love; for love is the story of troubles, Of troubles and love, that travel together The round world round. Behold the bubbles Of love! Then troubles and turbulent weather. Why, man had all Eden! Then love, then Cain! I do not like this bit of impatience, nor do I expect any one else to like it and only preserve it here as a sort of landmark or journal in my journey through life. It is only an example of almost an entire book, written in Italy. I had, after a long struggle with myself, settled down in Italy to remain, as I believed, and as you can see was very miserable, and wrote accordingly. ROME I Some leveled hills, a wall, a dome That lords its gold cross to the skies, While at its base a beggar cries For bread, and dies, and—this is Rome. II Yet Rome is Rome, and Rome she must And shall remain beside her gates, And tribute take of Kings and States, Until the stars have fallen to dust. III Yea, Time on yon Campagnan plain Has pitched in siege his battle-tents; And round about her battlements Has marched and trumpeted in vain. IV These skies are Rome! The very loam Lifts up and speaks in Roman pride; And Time, outfaced and still defied, Sits by and wags his beard at Rome. “POVERIS! POVERIS!” “Feed my sheep.” Come, let us ponder; it is fit— Born of the poor, born to the poor, The poor of purse, the poor of wit, Were first to find God's opened door— Were first to climb the ladder round by round That fell from heaven's door unto the ground. God's poor came first, the very first! God's poor were first to see, to hear, To feel the light of heaven burst Full on their faces. Far or near, His poor were first to follow, first to fall! What if at last His poor stand forth the first of all? ATTILA'S THRONE, TORCELLO I do recall some sad days spent By borders of the Orient, 'Twould make a tale. It matters not. I sought the loneliest seas; I sought The solitude of ruins, and forgot Mine own life and my littleness Before this fair land's mute distress. Slow sailing through the reedy isles, Some sunny summer yesterdays, I watched the storied yellow sail, And lifted prow of steely mail 'Tis all that's left Torcello now,— A pirate's yellow sail, a prow. I touch'd Torcello. Once on land, I took a sea-shell in my hand, And blew like any trumpeter. I felt the fig leaves lift and stir On trees that reach from ruin'd wall Above my head,—but that was all. Back from the farther island shore Came echoes trooping—nothing more. By cattle paths grass-grown and worn, Through marbled streets all stain'd and torn By time and battle, lone I walk'd. A bent old beggar, white as one For better fruitage blossoming, Came on. And as he came he talk'd Unto himself; for there were none In all his island, old and dim, To answer back or question him. I turn'd, retraced my steps once more. The hot miasma steam'd and rose In deadly vapor from the reeds That grew from out the shallow shore, Where peasants say the sea-horse feeds, And Neptune shapes his horn and blows. Yet here stood Adria once, and here Attila came with sword and flame, And set his throne of hollow'd stone In her high mart. And it remains Still lord o'er all. Where once the tears Of mute petition fell, the rains Of heaven fall. Lo! all alone There lifts this massive empty throne. I climb'd and sat that throne of stone To contemplate, to dream, to reign— Ay, reign above myself; to call The people of the past again Before me as I sat alone In all my kingdom. There were kine That browsed along the reedy brine, And now and then a tusky boar Would shake the high reeds of the shore, A bird blow by,—but that was all. I watch'd the lonesome sea-gull pass. I did remember and forget,— The past roll'd by; I lived alone. I sat the shapely, chisell'd stone That stands in tall, sweet grasses set; Ay, girdle deep in long, strong grass, And green alfalfa. Very fair The heavens were, and still and blue, For Nature knows no changes there. The Alps of Venice, far away, Like some half-risen late moon lay. How sweet the grasses at my feet! The smell of clover over-sweet. I heard the hum of bees. The bloom Of clover-tops and cherry-trees Was being rifled by the bees, And these were building in a tomb. The fair alfalfa—such as has Usurp'd the Occident, and grows With all the sweetness of the rose On Sacramento's sundown hills— Is there, and that dead island fills With fragrance. Yet the smell of death Comes riding in on every breath. That sad, sweet fragrance. It had sense, And sound, and voice. It was a part Of that which had possess'd my heart, And would not of my will go hence, 'Twas Autumn's breath; sad as the kiss Of some sweet worshipp'd woman is. Some snails had climb'd the throne and writ Their silver monograms on it In unknown tongues. I sat thereon, I dream'd until the day was gone; I blew again my pearly shell,— Blew long and strong, and loud and well; I puff'd my cheeks, I blew as when Horn'd satyrs piped and danced as men. Some mouse-brown cows that fed within Look'd up. A cowherd rose hard by, My single subject, clad in skin, Nor yet half-clad. I caught his eye,— He stared at me, then turn'd and fled. He frighten'd fled, and as he ran, Like wild beast from the face of man, Back o'er his shoulder threw his head. He stopp'd, and then this subject true, Mine only one in all the isle, Turn'd round, and, with a fawning smile, Came back and ask'd me for a sou! VENICE City at sea, thou art surely an ark, Sea-blown and a-wreck in the rain and dark, Where the white sea-caps are so toss'd and curl'd. Thy sins they were many—and behold the flood! And here and about us are beasts in stud. Creatures and beasts that creep and go, Enough, ay, and wicked enough I know, To populate, or devour, a world. O wrinkled old lion, looking down With brazen frown upon mine and me, From tower a-top of your watery town, Old king of the desert, once king of the sea: List! here is a lesson for thee to-day. Proud and immovable monarch, I say, Lo! here is a lesson to-day for thee, Of the things that were and the things to be. Dank palaces held by the populous sea For the good dead men, all cover'd with shell,— We will pay them a visit some day; and we, We may come to love their old palaces well. Bah! toppled old columns all tumbled across, Toss'd in the waters that lift and fall, Waving in waves long masses of moss, Toppled old columns,—and that will be all. I know you, lion of gray Saint Mark; You flutter'd all seas beneath your wing. Now, over the deep, and up in the dark, High over the girdles of bright gaslight, With wings in the air as if for flight, And crouching as if about to spring From top of your granite of Africa,— Say, what shall be said of you some day? What shall be said, O grim Saint Mark, Savage old beast so cross'd and churl'd, By the after-men from the under-world? What shall be said as they search along And sail these seas for some sign or spark Of the old dead fires of the dear old days, When men and story have gone their ways, Or even your city and name from song? Why, sullen old monarch of still'd Saint Mark, Strange men of my West, wise-mouth'd and strong, Will come some day and, gazing long And mute with wonder, will say of thee: “This is the Saint! High over the dark, Foot on the Bible and great teeth bare, Tail whipp'd back and teeth in the air— Lo! this is the Saint, and none but he!” A HAILSTORM IN VENICE The hail like cannon-shot struck the sea And churn'd it white as a creamy foam; Then hail like battle-shot struck where we Stood looking a-sea from a sea-girl home— Came shooting askance as if shot at the head; Then glass flew shiver'd and men fell down And pray'd where they fell, and the gray old town Lay riddled and helpless as if shot dead. Then lightning right full in the eyes! and then Fair women fell down flat on the face, And pray'd their pitiful Mother with tears, And pray'd black death as a hiding-place; And good priests pray'd for the sea-bound men As never good priests had pray'd for years. ... Then God spake thunder! And then the rain! The great, white, beautiful, high-born rain! SANTA MARIA: TORCELLO And yet again through the watery miles Of reeds I row'd, till the desolate isles Of the black-bead makers of Venice were not, I touch'd where a single sharp tower is shot To heaven, and torn by thunder and rent As if it had been Time's battlement. A city lies dead, and this great gravestone Stands on its grave like a ghost alone. Some cherry-trees grow here, and here An old church, simple and severe In ancient aspect, stands alone Amid the ruin and decay, all grown In moss and grasses. Old and quaint, With antique cuts of martyr'd saint, The gray church stands with stooping knees, Defying the decay of seas. Her pictured hell, with flames blown high, In bright mosaics wrought and set When man first knew the Nubian art; Her bearded saints as black as jet; Her quaint Madonna, dim with rain And touch of pious lips of pain, So touch'd my lonesome soul, that I Gazed long, then came and gazed again, And loved, and took her to my heart. Nor monk in black, nor Capucin, Nor priest of any creed was seen. A sunbrown'd woman, old and tall, And still as any shadow is, Stole forth from out the mossy wall With massive keys to show me this: Came slowly forth, and, following, Three birds—and all with drooping wing. Three mute brown babes of hers; and they— Oh, they were beautiful as sleep, Or death, below the troubled deep! And on the pouting lips of these, Red corals of the silent seas, Sweet birds, the everlasting seal Of silence that the God has set On this dead island sits for aye. I would forget, yet not forget Their helpless eloquence. They creep Somehow into my heart, and keep One bleak, cold corner, jewel set. They steal my better self away To them, as little birds that day Stole fruits from out the cherry-trees. So helpless and so wholly still, So sad, so wrapt in mute surprise, That I did love, despite my will. One little maid of ten—such eyes, So large and lovely, so divine! Such pouting lips, such pearly cheek! Did lift her perfect eyes to mine, Until our souls did touch and speak— Stood by me all that perfect day, Yet not one sweet word could she say. She turn'd her melancholy eyes So constant to my own, that I Forgot the going clouds, the sky; Found fellowship, took bread and wine: And so her little soul and mine Stood very near together there. And oh, I found her very fair! Yet not one soft word could she say: What did she think of all that day? IN A GONDOLA 'Twas night in Venice. Then down to the tide, Where a tall and a shadowy gondolier Lean'd on his oar, like a lifted spear;— 'Twas night in Venice; then side by side We sat in his boat. Then oar a-trip On the black boat's keel, then dip and dip, These boatmen should build their boats more wide, For we were together, and side by side. The sea it was level as seas of light, As still as the light ere a hand was laid To the making of lands, or the seas were made. 'Twas fond as a bride on her bridal night When a great love swells in her soul like a sea, And makes her but less than divinity. 'Twas night,—The soul of the day, I wis. A woman's face hiding from her first kiss. ... Ah, how one wanders! Yet after it all, To laugh at all lovers and to learn to scoff. ... When you really have naught of account to say, It is better, perhaps, to pull leaves by the way; Watch the round moon rise, or the red stars fall; And then, too, in Venice! dear, moth-eaten town; One palace of pictures; great frescoes spill'd down Outside the walls from the fullness thereof:— 'Twas night in Venice. On o'er the tide— These boats they are narrow as they can be, These crafts they are narrow enough, and we, To balance the boat, sat side by side— Out under the arch of the Bridge of Sighs, On under the arch of the star-sown skies; We two were together on the Adrian Sea,— The one fair woman of the world to me. THE CAPUCIN OF ROME Only a basket for fruits or bread And the bits you divide with your dog, which you Had left from your dinner. The round year through He never once smiles. He bends his head To the scorn of men. He gives the road To the grave ass groaning beneath his load. He is ever alone. Lo! never a hand Is laid in his hand through the whole wide land, Save when a man dies, and he shrives him home. And that is the Capucin monk of Rome. He coughs, he is hump'd, and he hobbles about In sandals of wood. Then a hempen cord Girdles his loathsome gown. Abhorr'd! Ay, lonely, indeed, as a leper cast out. One gown in three years! and—bah! how he smells! He slept last night in his coffin of stone, This monk that coughs, this skin and bone, This living dead corpse from the damp, cold cells,— Go ye where the Pincian, half-level'd down, Slopes slow to the south. These men in brown Have a monkery there, quaint, builded of stone; And, living or dead, 'tis the brown men's home,— These dead brown monks who are living in Rome! You will hear wood sandals on the sanded floor; A cough, then the lift of a latch, then the door Groans open, and—horror! Four walls of stone All gorgeous with flowers and frescoes of bone! There are bones in the corners and bones on the wall; And he barks like a dog that watches his bone, This monk in brown from his bed of stone— He barks, and he coughs, and that is all. At last he will cough as if up from his cell; Then strut with considerable pride about, And lead through his blossoms of bone, and smell Their odors; then talk, as he points them out, Of the virtues and deeds of the gents who wore The respective bones but the year before. Then he thaws at last, ere the bones are through, And talks right well as he turns them about And stirs up a most unsavory smell; Yea, talks of his brown dead brothers, till you Wish them, as they are, no doubt, in—well, A very deep well. ... And that may be why, As he shows you the door and bows good-by, That he bows so low for a franc or two, To shrive their souls and to get them out— These bony brown men who have their home, Dead or alive, in their cells at Rome. What good does he do in the world? Ah! well, Now that is a puzzler. ... But, listen! He prays. His life is the fast of the forty days. He seeks the despised; he divides the bread That he begg'd on his knees, does this old shave-head. And then, when the thief and the beggar fell! And then, when the terrible plague came down, Christ! how we cried to these men in brown When other men fled! Ah, who then was seen Stand firm to the death like the Capucin? SONGS OF THE HEBREW CHILDREN [“In the desert a fountain is springing] “In the desert a fountain is springing, In the wild waste there still is a tree.” Though the many lights dwindle to one light, There is help if the heavens have one.” “Change lays not her hand upon truth.” AT BETHLEHEM With incense and myrrh and sweet spices, Frankincense and sacredest oil In ivory, chased with devices Cut quaint and in serpentine coil; Heads bared, and held down to the bosom; Brows massive with wisdom and bronzed; Beards white as the white May in blossom; And borne to the breast and beyond,— Came the Wise of the East, bending lowly On staffs, with their garments girt round With girdles of hair, to the Holy Child Christ, in their sandals. The sound Of song and thanksgiving ascended— Deep night! Yet some shepherds afar Heard a wail with the worshipping blended And they then knew the sign of the star. “LA NOTTE” Is it night? And sits night at your pillow? Sits darkness about you like death? Rolls darkness above like a billow, As drowning men catch in their breath? Is it night, and deep night of dark errors, Of crosses, of pitfalls and bars? Then lift up your face from your terrors, For heaven alone holds the stars! Lo! shaggy beard shepherds, the fastness— Lorn, desolate Syrian sod; The darkness, the midnight, the vastness— That vast, solemn night bore a God! The night brought us God; and the Savior Lay down in a cradle to rest; A sweet cherub Babe in behavior, So that all baby-world might be blest. IN PALESTINE O Jebus! thou mother of prophets, Of soldiers and heroes of song; Let the crescent oppress thee and scoff its Blind will, let the days do thee wrong; But to me thou art sacred and splendid, And to me thou art matchless and fair, As the tawny sweet twilight, with blended Sunlight and red stars in her hair. Thy fair ships once came from sweet Cyprus, And fair ships drew in from Cyrene, With fruits and rich robes and sweet spices For thee and thine, eminent queen; And camels came in with the traces Of white desert dust in their hair As they kneel'd in the loud market places, And Arabs with lances were there. 'Tis past, and the Bedouin pillows His head where thy battlements fall, And thy temples flash gold to the billows, Never more over turreted wall. 'Tis past, and the green velvet mosses Have grown by the sea, and now sore Does the far billow mourn for his losses Of lifted white ships to the shore. Let the crescent uprise, let it flash on Thy dust in the garden of death, Thy chastened and passionless passion Sunk down to the sound of a breath; Yet you lived like a king on a throne and You died like a queen of the south; For you lifted the cup with your own hand To your proud and your passionate mouth; Like a splendid swift serpent surrounded With fire and sword, in your side You struck your hot fangs and confounded Your foes; you struck deep, and so—died. BEYOND JORDAN And they came to Him, mothers of Judah, Dark eyed and in splendor of hair, Bearing down over shoulders of beauty, And bosoms half hidden, half bare; And they brought Him their babes and besought Him Half kneeling, with suppliant air, To bless the brown cherubs they brought Him, With holy hands laid in their hair. Then reaching His hands He said, lowly, “Of such is My Kingdom”; and then Took the brown little babes in the holy White hands of the Savior of men; Held them close to His heart and caress'd them, Put His face down to theirs as in prayer, Put their hands to His neck, and so bless'd them With baby hands hid in His hair. FAITH There were whimsical turns of the waters, There were rhythmical talks of the sea,— There were gather'd the darkest eyed daughters Of men, by the deep Galilee. A blowing full sail, and a parting From multitudes, living in Him, A trembling of lips, and tears starting From eyes that look'd downward and dim. A mantle of night and a marching Of storms, and a sounding of seas, Of furrows of foam and of arching Black billows; a bending of knees; The rising of Christ—an entreating— Hands reach'd to the seas as He saith, “Have Faith!” And all seas are repeating, “Have Faith! Have Faith! Have Faith!” HOPE What song is well sung not of sorrow? What triumph well won without pain? What virtue shall be, and not borrow Bright luster from many a stain? What birth has there been without travail? What battle well won without blood? What good shall earth see without evil Ingarner'd as chaff with the good? Lo! the cross set in rocks by the Roman, And nourish'd by blood of the Lamb, And water'd by tears of the woman, Has flourish'd, has spread like a palm; Has spread in the frosts, and far regions Of snows in the North, and South sands, Where never the tramp of his legions Was heard, or reach'd forth his red hands. Be thankful; the price and the payment, The birth, the privations and scorn, The cross, and the parting of raiment, Are finish'd. The star brought us morn. Look starward; stand far and unearthy, Free soul'd as a banner unfurl'd. Be worthy, O brother, be worthy! For a God was the price of the world. CHARITY Her hands were clasped downward and doubled, Her head was held down and depress'd, Her bosom, like white billows troubled, Fell fitful and rose in unrest; Her robes were all dust and disorder'd Her glory of hair, and her brow, Her face, that had lifted and lorded, Fell pallid and passionless now. She heard not accusers that brought her In mockery hurried to Him, Nor heeded, nor said, nor besought her With eyes lifted doubtful and dim. All crush'd and stone-cast in behavior, She stood as a marble would stand, Then the Savior bent down, and the Savior In silence wrote on in the sand. What wrote He? How fondly one lingers And questions, what holy command Fell down from the beautiful fingers Of Jesus, like gems in the sand. O better the Scian uncherish'd Had died ere a note or device Of battle was fashion'd, than perish'd This only line written by Christ. He arose and look'd on the daughter Of Eve, like a delicate flower, And he heard the revilers that brought her; Men stormy, and strong as a tower; And He said, “She has sinn'd; let the blameless Come forward and cast the first stone!” But they, they fled shamed and yet shameless; And she, she stood white and alone. Who now shall accuse and arraign us? What man shall condemn and disown? Since Christ has said only the stainless Shall cast at his fellows a stone. For what man can bare us his bosom, And touch with his forefinger there, And say, 'Tis as snow, as a blossom? Beware of the stainless, beware! O woman, born first to believe us; Yea, also born first to forget; Born first to betray and deceive us; Yet first to repent and regret! O first then in all that is human, Yea! first where the Nazarene trod, O woman! O beautiful woman! Be then first in the kingdom of God! A SONG FOR PEACE I As a tale that is told, as a vision, Forgive and forget; for I say That the true shall endure the derision Of the false till the full of the day; II Ay, forgive as you would be forgiven; Ay, forget, lest the ill you have done Be remember'd against you in heaven And all the days under the sun. III For who shall have bread without labor? And who shall have rest without price? And who shall hold war with his neighbor With promise of peace with the Christ? IV The years may lay hand on fair heaven; May place and displace the red stars; May stain them, as blood stains are driven At sunset in beautiful bars; V May shroud them in black till they fret us As clouds with their showers of tears; May grind us to dust and forget us, May the years, O, the pitiless years! VI But the precepts of Christ are beyond them; The truths by the Nazarene taught, With the tramp of the ages upon them, They endure as though ages were naught; VII The deserts may drink up the fountains, The forests give place to the plain, The main may give place to the mountains, The mountains return to the main; VIII Mutations of worlds and mutations Of suns may take place, but the reign Of Time, and the toils and vexations Bequeath them, no, never a stain. IX Go forth to the fields as one sowing, Sing songs and be glad as you go, There are seeds that take root without showing, And bear some fruit whether or no. X And the sun shall shine sooner or later, Though the midnight breaks ground on the morn, Then appeal you to Christ, the Creator, And to gray bearded Time, His first born. THE ULTIMATE WEST [My Mountains still are free!] My Mountains still are free! They hurl oppression back; They keep the boon of liberty. THE GOLD THAT GREW BY SHASTA TOWN From Shasta town to Redding town The ground is torn by miners dead; The manzanita, rank and red, Drops dusty berries up and down Their grass-grown trails. Their silent mines Are wrapped in chaparral and vines; Yet one gray miner still sits down 'Twixt Redding and sweet Shasta town. The quail pipes pleasantly. The hare Leaps careless o'er the golden oat That grows below the water moat; The lizard basks in sunlight there. The brown hawk swims the perfumed air Unfrightened through the livelong day; And now and then a curious bear Comes shuffling down the ditch by night, And leaves some wide, long tracks in clay So human-like, so stealthy light, Where one lone cabin still stoops down 'Twixt Redding and sweet Shasta town. That great graveyard of hopes! of men Who sought for hidden veins of gold; Of young men suddenly grown old— Of old men dead, despairing when The gold was just within their hold! That storied land, whereon the light Of other days gleams faintly still; Somelike the halo of a hill That lifts above the falling night; That warm, red, rich and human land, That flesh-red soil, that warm red sand, Where one gray miner still sits down! 'Twixt Redding and sweet Shasta town! “I know the vein is here!” he said; For twenty years, for thirty years! While far away fell tears on tears From wife and babe who mourned him dead. No gold! No gold! And he grew old And crept to toil with bended head Amid a graveyard of his dead, Still seeking for that vein of gold. Then lo, came laughing down the years A sweet grandchild! Between his tears He laughed. He set her by the door The while he toiled; his day's toil o'er He held her chubby cheeks between His hard palms, laughed; and laughing cried. You should have seen, have heard and seen His boyish joy, his stout old pride, When toil was done and he sat down At night, below sweet Shasta town! At last his strength was gone. “No more! I mine no more. I plant me now A vine and fig-tree; worn and old, I seek no more my vein of gold. But, oh, I sigh to give it o'er; These thirty years of toil! somehow It seems so hard; but now, no more.” And so the old man set him down To plant, by pleasant Shasta town. And it was pleasant; piped the quail The full year through. The chipmunk stole, His whiskered nose and tossy tail Full buried in the sugar-bowl. And purple grapes and grapes of gold Swung sweet as milk. While orange-trees Grew brown with laden honey-bees. Oh! it was pleasant up and down That vine-set hill of Shasta town. And then that cloud-burst came! Ah, me! That torn ditch there! The mellow land Rolled seaward like a rope of sand, Nor left one leafy vine or tree Of all that Eden nestling down Below that moat by Shasta town! The old man sat his cabin's sill, His gray head bowed to hands and knee; The child went forth, sang pleasantly, Where burst the ditch the day before, And picked some pebbles from the hill. The old man moaned, moaned o'er and o'er: “My babe is dowerless, and I Must fold my helpless hands and die! Ah, me! What curse comes ever down On me and mine at Shasta town.” “Good Grandpa, see!” the glad child said, And so leaned softly to his side,— Laid her gold head to his gray head, And merry voiced and cheery cried, “Good Grandpa, do not weep, but see! I've found a peck of orange seeds! I searched the hill for vine or tree; Not one!—not even oats or weeds; But, oh! such heaps of orange seeds! “Come, good Grandpa! Now, once you said That God is good. So this may teach That we must plant each seed, and each May grow to be an orange tree. Now, good Grandpa, please raise your head, And please come plant the seeds with me.” And prattling thus, or like to this, The child thrust her full hands in his. He sprang, sprang upright as of old. “'Tis gold! 'tis gold! my hidden vein! 'Tis gold for you, sweet babe, 'tis gold! Yea, God is good; we plant again!” So one old miner still sits down By pleasant, sunlit Shasta town. THE SIOUX CHIEF'S DAUGHTER Two gray hawks ride the rising blast; Dark cloven clouds drive to and fro By peaks pre-eminent in snow; A sounding river rushes past, So wild, so vortex-like, and vast. A lone lodge tops the windy hill; A tawny maiden, mute and still, Stands waiting at the river's brink, As eager, fond as you can think. A mighty chief is at her feet; She does not heed him wooing so— She hears the dark, wild waters flow; She waits her lover, tall and fleet, From out far beaming hills of snow. He comes! The grim chief springs in air— His brawny arm, his blade is bare. She turns; she lifts her round, brown hand; She looks him fairly in the face; She moves her foot a little pace And says, with calmness and command, “There's blood enough in this lorn land. “But see! a test of strength and skill, Of courage and fierce fortitude; To breast and wrestle with the rude And storm-born waters, now I will Bestow you both. “... Stand either side! And you, my burly chief, I know Would choose my right. Now peer you low Across the waters wild and wide. See! leaning so this morn I spied Red berries dip yon farther side. “See, dipping, dripping in the stream! Twin boughs of autumn berries gleam! “Now this, brave men, shall be the test: Plunge in the stream, bear knife in teeth To cut yon bough for bridal wreath. Plunge in! and he who bears him best, And brings yon ruddy fruit to land The first, shall have both heart and hand.” Two tawny men, tall, brown and thewed Like antique bronzes rarely seen, Shot up like flame. She stood between Like fixed, impassive fortitude. Then one threw robes with sullen air, And wound red fox-tails in his hair; But one with face of proud delight Entwined a wing of snowy white. She stood between. She sudden gave The sign and each impatient brave Shot sudden in the sounding wave; The startled waters gurgled round; Their stubborn strokes kept sullen sound. Oh, then uprose the love that slept! Oh, then her heart beat loud and strong! Oh, then the proud love pent up long Broke forth in wail upon the air! And leaning there she sobbed and wept, With dark face mantled in her hair. She sudden lifts her leaning brow. He nears the shore, her love! and now The foam flies spouting from the face That laughing lifts from out the race. The race is won, the work is done! She sees the kingly crest of snow; She knows her tall, brown Idaho. She cries aloud, she laughing cries, And tears are streaming from her eyes: “O splendid, kingly Idaho! I kiss thy lifted crest of snow. “My tall and tawny king, come back! Come swift, O sweet! why falter so? Come! Come! What thing has crossed your track? I kneel to all the gods I know. ... Great Spirit, what is this I dread? Why, there is blood! the wave is red! That wrinkled chief, outstripped in race, Dives down, and, hiding from my face, Strikes underneath. “... He rises now! Now plucks my hero's berry bough, And lifts aloft his red fox head, And signals he has won for me. ... Hist, softly! Let him come and see. “Oh, come! my white-crowned hero, come! Oh, come! and I will be your bride, Despite yon chieftain's craft and might. Come back to me! my lips are dumb, My hands are helpless with despair; The hair you kissed, my long, strong hair, Is reaching to the ruddy tide, That you may clutch it when you come. “How slow he buffets back the wave! O God, he sinks! O Heaven! save My brave, brave king! He rises! see! Hold fast, my hero! Strike for me. Strike straight this way! Strike firm and strong! Hold fast your strength. It is not long— O God, he sinks! He sinks! Is gone! “And did I dream and do I wake? Or did I wake and now but dream? And what is this crawls from the stream? Oh, here is some mad, mad mistake! What, you! the red fox at my feet? You first, and failing from the race? What! You have brought me berries red? What! You have brought your bride a wreath? You sly red fox with wrinkled face— That blade has blood between your teeth! “Lie low! lie low! while I lean o'er And clutch your red blade to the shore. ... Ha! ha! Take that! take that and that! Ha! ha! So, through your coward throat The full day shines! ... Two fox-tails float Far down, and I but mock thereat. “But what is this? What snowy crest Climbs out the willows of the west, All dripping from his streaming hair? 'Tis he! My hero brave and fair! His face is lifting to my face, And who shall now dispute the race? “The gray hawks pass, O love! and doves O'er yonder lodge shall coo their loves. My hands shall heal your wounded breast, And in yon tall lodge two shall rest.” A SHASTA TALE OF LOVE “And God saw the light that it was good.” I heard a tale long, long ago, Where I had gone apart to pray By Shasta's pyramid of snow, That touches me unto this day. I know the fashion is to say An Arab tale, an Orient lay; But when the grocer rings my gold On counter, flung from greasy hold, He cares not from Acadian vale It comes, or savage mountain chine;— But this the Shastan tale: Once in the olden, golden days, When men and beasts companioned, when All went in peace about their ways Nor God had hid His face from men Because man slew his brother beast To make his most unholy feast, A gray coyote, monkish cowled, Upraised his face and wailed and howled The while he made his patient round; For lo! the red men all lay dead, Stark, frozen on the ground. The very dogs had fled the storm, A mother with her long, meshed hair Bound tight about her baby's form, Lay frozen, all her body bare. Her last shred held her babe in place; Her last breath warmed her baby's face. Then, as the good monk brushed the snow Aside from mother loving so, He heard God from the mount above Speak through the clouds and loving say: “Yea, all is dead but Love.” “Now take up Love and cherish her, And seek the white man with all speed, And keep Love warm within thy fur; For oh, he needeth love indeed. Take all and give him freely, all Of love you find, or great or small; For he is very poor in this, So poor he scarce knows what love is.” The gray monk raised Love in his paws And sped, a ghostly streak of gray, To where the white man was. But man uprose, enraged to see A gaunt wolf track his new-hewn town. He called his dogs, and angrily He brought his flashing rifle down. Then God said: “On his hearthstone lay The seed of Love, and come away; The seed of Love, 'tis needed so, And pray that it may grow and grow.” And so the gray monk crept at night And laid Love down, as God had said, A faint and feeble light. So faint, indeed, the cold hearthstone It seemed would chill starved Love to death; And so the monk gave all his own And crouched and fanned it with his breath Until a red cock crowed for day. Then God said: “Rise up, come away.” The beast obeyed, but yet looked back All morn along his lonely track; For he had left his all in all, His own Love, for that famished Love Seemed so exceeding small. And God said: “Look not back again.” But ever, where a campfire burned, And he beheld strong, burly men At meat, he sat him down and turned His face to wail and wail and mourn The Love laid on that cold hearthstone. Then God was angered, and God said: “Be thou a beggar then; thy head Hath been a fool, but thy swift feet, Because they bore sweet Love, shall be The fleetest of all fleet.” And ever still about the camp, By chine or plain, in heat or hail, A homeless, hungry, hounded tramp, The gaunt coyote keeps his wail. And ever as he wails he turns His head, looks back and yearns and yearns For lost Love, laid that wintry day To warm a hearthstone far away. Poor loveless, homeless beast, I keep Your lost Love warm for you, and, too, A cañon cool and deep. LOVE IN THE SIERRAS “No, not so lonely now—I love A forest maiden; she is mine And on Sierras' slopes of pine, The vines below, the snows above, A solitary lodge is set Within a fringe of water'd firs; And there my wigwam fires burn, Fed by a round brown patient hand, That small brown faithful hand of hers That never rests till my return. The yellow smoke is rising yet; Tiptoe, and see it where you stand Lift like a column from the land. “There are no sea-gems in her hair, No jewels fret her dimpled hands, And half her bronzen limbs are bare. Her round brown arms have golden bands, Broad, rich, and by her cunning hands Cut from the yellow virgin ore, And she does not desire more. I wear the beaded wampum belt That she has wove—the sable pelt That she has fringed red threads around; And in the morn, when men are not, I wake the valley with the shot That brings the brown deer to the ground. And she beside the lodge at noon Sings with the wind, while baby swings In sea-shell cradle by the bough— Sings low, so like the clover sings With swarm of bees; I hear her now, I see her sad face through the moon ... Such songs!—would earth had more of such! She has not much to say, and she Lifts never voice to question me In aught I do ... and that is much. I love her for her patient trust, And my love's forty-fold return— A value I have not to learn As you ... at least, as many must ... ... “She is not over tall or fair; Her breasts are curtained by her hair, And sometimes, through the silken fringe, I see her bosom's wealth, like wine Burst through in luscious ruddy tinge— And all its wealth and worth are mine. I know not that one drop of blood Of prince or chief is in her veins: I simply say that she is good, And loves me with pure womanhood. ... When that is said, why, what remains?” OLD GIB AT CASTLE ROCKS Parties with Indian depredation claims against the Government desiring exact information touching the first trouble with the Modocs, now nearly forty years ago, the venerable leader of the volunteers in the first battle made out, with his own hand, the following quaint account of it, swore to it before a Notary, and sent it to Washington. The italics, capitals, and all are as he set them down in his crude but truthful way.— Frank Leslie's Magazine, 1893. I Reuben P. Gibson Was Born in Lowell Mass in 1826 of American Parents, shiped on board a whaler of New Bedford in 1846, Rounded Cape Horn, spent several years on the Pacific Ocean, and in 1846 landed in California. Came to the Mines in Shasta County California, and have lived here in Shasta County more than 40 years, most of which time I have been and am now a Magistrate. I have had much to do with Indians, and in 1855 they became Very Restless, and some of them took to the Castle Rocks, Called Castle del Diablo, at that time by the Mexicans, and they—the Hostiles began to destroy our Property, and Kill White people. Troops of the Regular Army tried to engage them, but found them inaccessible. I then raised a Company of Twenty-Nine White men and thirty Indian (friendly) Scouts and after hard Perilous Marches by Night. We engaged and destroyed the Hostiles, having taken Many Scalps. This battle was Fought in the Castle Rocks in this Shasta County and was in June 1855. The hostiles were Modocs and Other Renegades and this was the first Battle in a war that Spread all over the Coast I had Some Indians hurt, and one man mortally wounded, James Lane by name. Some Others were more or less hurt with Arrows. Joaquin Miller Received an Arrow in the face and Neck at my Side and we thought would die but at last got Well. He and Mountain Joe had a Post at Soda Springs below Castle Rocks, and their property had been destroyed and made untenable. In all My Experience I know of nothing in Indian warfare so effectual for good as this Campaign. The indians had Possessions of the lines of travel connecting Middle and Northern California and it Was impossible for the Mails to get through until the Hostiles were destroyed. (Signed) Reuben P Gibson Subscribed and sworn to before me this 17th day of November, 1892, and I hereby certify that I am well acquainted with said affiant and know him to be a person of veracity and entitled to credit. He is a Justice of the Peace in this Shasta County. [SEAL] F. P. Primm, Notary Public in and for Shasta County, Cal. Let me here introduce a line of facts stranger than anything imagined in all these pages. I had not intended to insert these verses and had delivered to my publishers the completed collection without them. Against my objection that the lines were not only too personal, but unequal, it was urged that they would be missed by my readers; besides their preservation was due to my old commander, and as this was the first of my three terrible Indian campaigns, and I had served only as private instead of leader, I could hardly be held guilty of egotism. Deference to the dead made me consent to try and find the lines at once in some library. On my way I met a man whom I knew but slightly as U. S. Marshal under President Hayes. My weary eyes were unequal to the task before me, and I asked him to go with me. This he did, and now let his letter tell the rest. “Oakland, Dec. 20, 1896. “Joaquin, my dear fellow, I enclose herewith the copies you expressed a wish for. I think they are exact. I was especially careful in making the affidavit of Old Gib; so where he differs with Webster orthographically, I follow Gib. “Now my boy, I've a little story. I'll be considerate and make it brief. In the early part of the summer of 1855, I was one of a company of about twenty that left Auburn, Placer Co., on a prospecting expedition, intending, unless we found satisfactory prospects nearer, to go to the Trinity. We crossed the Yuba and Feather, camping a few days on Nelson Creek, then traveling in a northwesterly direction, we reached the headwaters of the Sacramento, where we found a party of white men and Indians who, a day or two previous to our meeting them, had had a desperate fight with Indians. They told us they had lost several men, killed and wounded, but had nearly exterminated the Indians. I saw one of their men, a boy in appearance, who had, as I understood, received two arrow wounds in the face and neck. He was in great pain, and no one believed he could recover. “Twelve years later I, then Sheriff of Placer Co., had occassion to go to Shasta on official business. W. E. Hopping was then Sheriff of Shasta Co. In the course of conversation with him, I spoke of the incident narrated above. He interrupted me, and said: ‘The Captain of the volunteers at the battle is in town.’ He found him, and introduced me to the man who was doubtless Old Gib, though his name has gone from my memory. I asked about the young fellow who was so desperately wounded. ‘Oh, he pulled through all right, the game little cuss,’ said he, ‘he's up in Oregon, I believe.’ I don't think he mentioned his name, but in copying the affidavit of Old Gib, it dawned upon me who that ‘game little cuss’ was. Yours, A. W. Poole.” His eyes are dim, he gropes his way, His step is doubtful, slow, And now men pass him by today: But forty years ago— Why forty years ago I say Old Gib was good to know. For, forty years ago today, Where cars glide to and fro, The Modoc held the world at bay, And blood was on the snow. Ay, forty years ago I say Old Gib was good to know. Full forty years ago today This valley lay in flame; Up yonder pass and far away, Red ruin swept the same: Two women, with their babes at play, Were butchered in black shame. 'Twas then with gun and flashing eye Old Gib loomed like a pine; “Now will you fight, or will you fly? I'll take a fight in mine. Come let us fight; come let us die!” There came just twenty-nine. Just twenty-nine who dared to die, And, too, a motley crew Of half-tamed red men; would they fly, Or would they fight him too? No time to question or reply, That was a time to do. Up, up, straight up where thunders grow And growl in Castle Rocks, Straight up till Shasta gleamed in snow, And shot red battle shocks; Till clouds lay shepherded below, A thousand ghostly flocks. Yet up and up Old Gibson led, No looking backward then; His bare feet bled; the rocks were red From torn, bare-footed men. Yet up, up, up, till well nigh dead— The Modoc in his den! Then cried the red chief from his height, “Now, white man, what would you? Behold my hundreds for the fight, But yours so faint and few; We are as rain, as hail at night But you, you are as dew. “White man, go back; I beg go back, I will not fight so few; Yet if I hear one rifle crack, Be that the doom of you! Back! down, I say, back down your track, Back, down! What else to do?” “What else to do? Avenge or die! Brave men have died before; And you shall fight, or you shall fly. You find no women more, No babes to butcher now; for I Shall storm your Castle's door!” Then bang! whiz bang! whiz bang and ping! Six thousand feet below, Sweet Sacramento ceased to sing, But wept and wept, for oh! These arrows sting as adders sting, And they kept stinging so. Then one man cried: “Brave men have died, And we can die as they; But ah! my babe, my one year's bride! And they so far away. Brave Captain lead us back—aside, Must all here die today?” His face, his hands, his body bled: Yea, no man there that day— No white man there but turned to red, In that fierce fatal fray; But Gib with set teeth only said: “No; we came here to stay!” They stayed and stayed, and Modocs stayed, But when the night came on, No white man there was now afraid, The last Modoc had gone; His ghost in Castle Rocks was laid Till everlasting dawn. THE LARGER COLLEGE ON LAYING THE COLLEGE CORNER-STONE Where San Diego seas are warm, Where winter winds from warm Cathay Sing sibilant, where blossoms swarm With Hybla's bees, we come to lay This tribute of the truest, best, The warmest daughter of the West. Here Progress plants her corner-stone Against this warm, still, Cortez wave. In ashes of the Aztec's throne, In tummals of the Toltec's grave, We plant this stone, and from the sod Pick painted fragments of his god. Here Progress lifts her torch to teach God's pathway through the pass of care; Her altar-stone Balboa's Beach, Her incense warm, sweet, perfumed air; Such incense! where white strophes reach And lap and lave Balboa's Beach! We plant this stone as some small seed Is sown at springtime, warm with earth; We sow this seed as some good deed Is sown, to grow until its worth Shall grow, through rugged steeps of time, To touch the utmost star sublime. We lift this lighthouse by the sea, The westmost sea, the westmost shore, To guide man's ship of destiny When Scylla and Charybdis roar; To teach him strength, to proudly teach God's grandeur, where His white palms reach: To teach not Sybil books alone; Man's books are but a climbing stair, Lain step by step, like stairs of stone; The stairway here, the temple there— Man's lampad honor, and his trust, The God who called him from the dust. Man's books are but man's alphabet, Beyond and on his lessons lie— The lessons of the violet, The large gold letters of the sky; The love of beauty, blossomed soil, The large content, the tranquil toil: The toil that nature ever taught, The patient toil, the constant stir, The toil of seas where shores are wrought, The toil of Christ, the carpenter; The toil of God incessantly By palm-set land or frozen sea. Behold this sea, that sapphire sky! Where nature does so much for man, Shall man not set his standard high, And hold some higher, holier plan? Some loftier plan than ever planned By outworn book of outworn land? Where God has done so much for man! Shall man for God do aught at all? The soul that feeds on books alone— I count that soul exceeding small That lives alone by book and creed,— A soul that has not learned to read. TO THE PIONEERS READ SAN FRANCISCO, 1894 How swift this sand, gold-laden, runs! How slow these feet, once swift and firm! Ye came as romping, rosy sons, Come jocund up at College term; Ye came so jolly, stormy, strong, Ye drown'd the roll-call with your song. But now ye lean a list'ning ear And—“Adsum! Adsum! I am here!” My brave world-builders of a world That tops the keystone, star of States, All hail! Your battle flags are furled In fruitful peace. The golden gates Are won. The jasper walls be yours. Your sun sinks down yon soundless shores. Night falls. But lo! your lifted eyes Greet gold outcroppings in the skies. Companioned with Sierra's peaks Our storm-born eagle shrieks his scorn Of doubt or death, and upward seeks Through unseen worlds the coming morn. Or storm, or calm, or near, or far, His eye fixed on the morning star, He knows, as God knows, there is dawn; And so keeps on, and on, and on! So ye, brave men of bravest days, Fought on and on with battered shield, Up bastion, rampart, till the rays Of full morn met ye on the field. Ye knew not doubt; ye only knew To do and dare, and dare and do! Ye knew that time, that God's first-born, Would turn the darkest night to morn. Ye gave your glorious years of youth And lived as heroes live—and die. Ye loved the truth, ye lived the truth; Ye knew that cowards only lie. Then heed not now one serpent's hiss, Or trait'rous, trading, Judas kiss. Let slander wallow in his slime; Still leave the truth to God and time. Worn victors, few and true, such clouds As track God's trailing garment's hem Where Shasta keeps shall be your shrouds, And ye shall pass the stars in them. Your tombs shall be while time endures, Such hearts as only truth secures; Your everlasting monuments Sierra's snow-topt battle tents. “49” This poem is taken from “'49, or the Gold Seekers,” by permission of Funk &amp; Wagnalls, New York, publishers of the book. The words have been set to music and selected as the Song of the Native Sons of California. It was sung in Mining Camps long before it was in print. We have worked our claims, We have spent our gold, Our barks are astrand on the bars; We are battered and old, Yet at night we behold, Outcroppings of gold in the stars. Chorus— Tho' battered and old, Our hearts are bold, Yet oft do we repine; For the days of old, For the days of gold, For the days of forty-nine. Where the rabbits play, Where the quail all day Pipe on the chaparral hill; A few more days, And the last of us lays His pick aside and all is still. We are wreck and stray, We are cast away, Poor battered old hulks and spars; But we hope and pray, On the judgment day, We shall strike it up in the stars. SAN DIEGO “O for a beaker of the warm South; The true, the blushful hypocrine!” What shall be said of the sun-born Pueblo? This town sudden born in the path of the sun? This town of St. James, of the calm San Diego, As suddenly born as if shot from a gun? Why, speak of her warmly; why, write her name down As softer than sunlight, as warmer than wine! Why speak of her bravely; this ultimate town With feet in the foam of the vast Argentine: The vast argent seas of the Aztec, of Cortez! The boundless white border of battle-torn lands— The fall of Napoleon, the rise of red Juarez— The footfalls of nations are heard on her sands. PIONEERS TO THE GREAT EMERALD LAND READ AT PORTLAND, 1896 Emerald, emerald, emerald Land; Land of the sun mists, land of the sea, Stately and stainless and storied and grand As cloud-mantled Hood in white majesty— Mother of States, we are worn, we are gray— Mother of men, we are going away. Mother of States, tall mother of men, Of cities, of churches, of homes, of sweet rest, We are going away, we must journey again, As of old we journeyed to the vast, far West. We tent by the river, our feet once more, Please God, are set for the ultimate shore. Mother, white mother, white Oregon In emerald kilt, with star-set crown Of sapphire, say is it night? Is it dawn? Say what of the night? Is it well up and down? We are going away. ... From yon high watch tower, Young men, strong men, say, what of the hour? Young men, strong men, there is work to be done; Faith to be cherished, battles to fight, Victories won were never well won Save fearlessly won for God and the right. These cities, these homes, sweet peace and her spell Be ashes, but ashes, with the infidel. Have Faith, such Faith as your fathers knew, All else must follow if you have but Faith. Be true to their Faith, and you must be true. “Lo! I will be with you,” the Master saith. Good by, dawn breaks; it is coming full day And one by one we strike tent and away. Good by. Slow folding our snow-white tents, Our dim eyes lift to the farther shore, And never these riddled, gray regiments Shall answer full roll-call any more. Yet never a doubt, nay, never a fear Of old, or now, knew the Pioneer. ALASKA Ice built, ice bound and ice bounded, Such cold seas of silence! such room! Such snow-light, such sea light confounded With thunders that smite like a doom! Such grandeur! such glory! such gloom! Hear that boom! hear that deep distant boom Of an avalanche hurled Down this unfinished world! Ice seas! and ice summits! ice spaces In splendor of white, as God's throne! Ice worlds to the pole! and ice places Untracked, and unnamed, and unknown! Hear that boom! Hear the grinding, the groan Of the ice-gods in pain! Hear the moan Of yon ice mountain hurled Down this unfinished world. TWILIGHT AT THE HIGHTS The brave young city by the Balboa seas Lies compassed about by the hosts of night— Lies humming, low, like a hive of bees; And the day lies dead. And its spirit's flight Is far to the west; while the golden bars That bound it are broken to a dust of stars. Come under my oaks, oh, drowsy dusk! The wolf and the dog; dear incense hour When Mother Earth hath a smell of musk, And things of the spirit assert their power— When candles are set to burn in the west— Set head and foot to the day at rest. ARBOR DAY Against our golden orient dawns We lift a living light to-day, That shall outshine the splendid bronze That lords and lights that lesser Bay. Sweet Paradise was sown with trees; Thy very name, lorn Nazareth, Means woods, means sense of birds and bees, And song of leaves with lisping breath. God gave us Mother Earth, full blest With robes of green in healthful fold; We tore the green robes from her breast! We sold our mother's robes for gold! We sold her garments fair, and she Lies shamed and naked at our feet! In penitence we plant a tree; We plant the cross and count it meet. Lo, here, where Balboa's waters toss, Here in this glorious Spanish bay, We plant the cross, the Christian cross, The Crusade Cross of Arbor Day. BY THE BALBOA SEAS The golden fleece is at our feet, Our hills are girt in sheen of gold; Our golden flower-fields are sweet With honey hives. A thousand-fold More fair our fruits on laden stem Than Jordan tow'rd Jerusalem. Behold this mighty sea of seas! The ages pass in silence by. Gold apples of Hesperides Hang at our God-land gates for aye. Our golden shores have golden keys Where sound and sing the Balboa seas. MAGNOLIA BLOSSOMS The broad magnolia's blooms are white; Her blooms are large, as if the moon Had lost her way some lazy night, And lodged here till the afternoon. Oh, vast white blossoms breathing love! White bosom of my lady dead, In your white heaven overhead I look, and learn to look above. CALIFORNIA'S CHRISTMAS The stars are large as lilies! Morn Seems some illumined story— The story of our Savior born, Told from old turrets hoary— The full moon smiling tips a horn And hies to bed in glory! My sunclad city walks in light And lasting summer weather; Red roses bloom on bosoms white And rosy cheeks together. If you should smite one cheek, still smite For she will turn the other. The thronged warm street tides to and fro And Love, roseclad, discloses. The only snowstorm we shall know Is this white storm of roses— It seems like Maytime, mating so, And—Nature counting noses. Soft sea winds sleep on yonder tide; You hear some boatmen rowing. Their sisters' hands trail o'er the side; They toy with warm waves flowing; Their laps are laden deep and wide From rose-trees green and growing. Such roses white! such roses red! Such roses richly yellow! The air is like a perfume fed From autumn fruits full mellow— But see! a brother bends his head, An oar forgets its fellow! Give me to live in land like this, Nor let me wander further; Some sister in some boat of bliss And I her only brother— Sweet paradise on earth it is; I would not seek another. THE MEN OF FORTY-NINE Those brave old bricks of forty-nine! What lives they lived! what deaths they died! A thousand cañons, darkling wide Below Sierra's slopes of pine, Receive them now. And they who died Along the far, dim, desert route— Their ghosts are many. Let them keep Their vast possessions. The Piute, The tawny warrior, will dispute No boundary with these. And I Who saw them live, who felt them die, Say, let their unplow'd ashes sleep, Untouch'd by man, on plain or steep. The bearded, sunbrown'd men who bore The burden of that frightful year, Who toil'd, but did not gather store, They shall not be forgotten. Drear And white, the plains of Shoshonee Shall point us to that farther shore, And long, white, shining lines of bones, Make needless sign or white mile-stones. The wild man's yell, the groaning wheel; The train that moved like drifting barge; The dust that rose up like a cloud— Like smoke of distant battle! Loud The great whips rang like shot, and steel Of antique fashion, crude and large, Flash'd back as in some battle charge. They sought, yea, they did find their rest. Along that long and lonesome way, These brave men buffet'd the West With lifted faces. Full were they Of great endeavor. Brave and true As stern Crusader clad in steel, They died a-field as it was fit. Made strong with hope, they dared to do Achievement that a host today Would stagger at, stand back and reel, Defeated at the thought of it. What brave endeavor to endure! What patient hope, when hope was past! What still surrender at the last, A thousand leagues from hope! how pure They lived, how proud they died! How generous with life! The wide And gloried age of chivalry Hath not one page like this to me. Let all these golden days go by, In sunny summer weather. I But think upon my buried brave, And breathe beneath another sky. Let Beauty glide in gilded car, And find my sundown seas afar, Forgetful that 'tis but one grave From eastmost to the westmost wave. Yea, I remember! The still tears That o'er uncoffin'd faces fell! The final, silent, sad farewell! God! these are with me all the years! They shall be with me ever. I Shall not forget. I hold a trust. They are part of my existence. When Swift down the shining iron track You sweep, and fields of corn flash back, And herds of lowing steers move by, And men laugh loud, in mute mistrust, I turn to other days, to men Who made a pathway with their dust. THE HEROES OF AMERICA O perfect heroes of the earth, That conquer'd forests, harvest set! O sires, mothers of my West! How shall we count your proud bequest? But yesterday ye gave us birth; We eat your hard-earned bread today, Nor toil nor spin nor make regret, But praise our petty selves and say How great we are. We all forget The still endurance of the rude Unpolish'd sons of solitude. What strong, uncommon men were these, These settlers hewing to the seas! Great horny-handed men and tan; Men blown from many a barren land Beyond the sea; men red of hand, And men in love, and men in debt, Like David's men in battle set; And men whose very hearts had died, Who only sought these woods to hide Their wretchedness, held in the van; Yet every man among them stood Alone, along that sounding wood, And every man somehow a man. They push'd the mailéd wood aside, They toss'd the forest like a toy, That grand forgotten race of men— The boldest band that yet has been Together since the siege of Troy. YOSEMITE Sound! sound! sound! O colossal walls and crown'd In one eternal thunder! Sound! sound! sound! O ye oceans overhead, While we walk, subdued in wonder, In the ferns and grasses, under And beside the swift Merced! Fret! fret! fret! Streaming, sounding banners, set On the giant granite castles In the clouds and in the snow! But the foe he comes not yet,— We are loyal, valiant vassals, And we touch the trailing tassels Of the banners far below. Surge! surge! surge! From the white Sierra's verge, To the very valley blossom. Surge! surge! surge! Yet the song-bird builds a home, And the mossy branches cross them, And the tasselled tree-tops toss them, In the clouds of falling foam. Sweep! sweep! sweep! O ye heaven-born and deep, In one dread, unbroken chorus! We may wonder or may weep,— We may wait on God before us; We may shout or lift a hand,— We may bow down and deplore us, But may never understand. Beat! beat! beat! We advance, but would retreat From this restless, broken breast Of the earth in a convulsion. We would rest, but dare not rest, For the angel of expulsion From this Paradise below Waves us onward and ... we go. DEAD IN THE SIERRAS His footprints have failed us, Where berries are red, And madroños are rankest, The hunter is dead! The grizzly may pass By his half-open door; May pass and repass On his path, as of yore; The panther may crouch In the leaves on his limb; May scream and may scream,— It is nothing to him. Prone, bearded, and breasted Like columns of stone; And tall as a pine— As a pine overthrown! His camp-fires gone, What else can be done Than let him sleep on Till the light of the sun? Ay, tombless! what of it? Marble is dust, Cold and repellent; And iron is rust. “THE FOURTH” IN OREGON This poem was read, 1896, near the scene of the Whitman massacre at the old Mission. The story of Oregon—Aure il Agua; Hear the Waters—glowing with great deeds, drama, tragedy, surpassing anything in the history of any other State, east or west, old or new. When the paw of the British lion reached down from Canada and laid heavy hand on Oregon, these pioneers met under their great firs and proclaimed to the world that they were not British subjects, but American citizens. Marcus P. Whitman mounted horse in midwinter and set out alone and rode 3,000 miles to lay the facts before the President. Yet the Government never lifted a hand to help save Oregon to the Nation. So far from that, a Senator rose in his place and literally denounced all effort in that direction, saying: “I would to God we had never heard of that country; we do not want a foot of ground on the Pacific Ocean.” Webster was hardly less cruel. But undaunted, Whitman gathered up hundreds of wagons and led back to Oregon; the first that ever crossed the plains. He saved Oregon, but lost his life and all his house. Then the pioneers, to avenge the massacre, declared war on their own account, fought it to a finish without so much as a single man or gun from the Government, made peace on their own account, and then went to work and dug their own gold from their own ground, and with their own hands coined it and paid their war debts and from the first kept their paper with its face in virgin gold. The coins, virgin gold with a sheaf of wheat on one side, showing the richness of the soil, and a beaver on the reverse, typifying the industry of the people. Oregon is the only division of this republic that ever coined gold under authority of law. And even in later Indian wars Oregon was always treated meanly, most meanly. More than once every man and boy who could carry a gun or drive a team was in the field. My father and his three sons, aged ten, twelve and fourteen, were all at one time teamsters in a supply train. And the Government paid for services and supplies but tardily, if at all. The meanness is incredible. There are millions still due Oregon. No, I am not angry, or selfish either; I never received or claimed one cent for services, supplies or losses. But some of these old pioneers are in need now. Hail, Independence of old ways! Old worlds! The West declares the West, Her storied ways, her gloried days, Because the West deserveth best. This new, true land of noblest deeds Has rights, has sacred rights and needs. Sing, ye who may, this natal day; Of dauntless thought, of men of might, In lesser lands and far away. But truth is truth and right is right. And, oh, to sing like sounding flood, These boundless boundaries writ in blood! Three thousand miles of battle deeds, Of burning Moscows, Cossacks, snows; Then years and years of British greed, Of grasping greed; of lurking foes. I say no story ever writ Or said, or sung, surpasses it! And who has honored us, and who Has bravely dared stand up and say: “Give ye to Cæsar Cæsar's due?” Unpaid, unpensioned, mute and gray, Some few survivors of the brave, Still hold enough land for a grave. How much they dared, how much they won— Why, o'er your banner of bright stars, Their star should be the blazing sun Above the battle star of Mars. Here, here beside brave Whitman's dust, Let us be bravely, frankly just. The mountains from the first were so. The mountains from the first were free. They ever laid the tyrant low, And kept the boon of liberty. The levels of the earth alone Endured the tyrant, bore the throne. The levels of the earth alone Bore Sodoms, Babylons of crime, And all sad cities overthrown Along the surging surf of time. The coward, slave, creeps in the fen: God's mountains only cradle men. Aye, wise and great was Washington, And brave the men of Bunker Hill; Most brave and worthy every one, In work and faith and fearless will And brave endeavor for the right, Until yon stars burst through their night. Aye, wise and good was Washington. Yet when he laid his sword aside, The bravest deed yet done was done. And when in stately strength and pride He took the plow and turned the mold He wrote God's autograph in gold. He wrought the fabled fleece of gold In priceless victories of peace, With plowshare set in mother mold; Then gathering the golden fleece About his manly, martial breast, This farmer laid him down to rest. O! this was godlike! And yet, who Of all men gathered here today Has not drawn sword as swift as true, Then laid its reddened edge away, And took the plow, and turned the mold To sow yon sunny steeps with gold. Aye, this true valor! Sing who will Of battle charge, of banners borne Triumphant up the blazing hill On battle's front, of banners torn, Of horse and rider torn and rent, Red regiment on regiment. Yet this were boy's play to that man Who, far out yonder lone frontier, With wife and babe fought in the van, Fought on, fought on, year after year. No brave, bright flag to cheer the brave, No farewell gun above his grave. I say such silent pioneers Who here set plowshare to the sun, And silent gave their sunless years, Were kings of heroes every one. No Brandywine, no Waterloo E'er knew one hero half so true! A nation's honor for our dead, God's pity for the stifled pain; And tears as ever woman shed, Sweet woman's tears for maimed or slain. But man's tears for the mute, unknown, Who fights alone, who falls alone. The very bravest of the brave, The hero of all lands to me? Far up yon yellow lifting wave His brave ship cleaves the golden sea. And gold or gain, or never gain, No argosy sails there in vain. And who the coward? Hessian he, Who turns his back upon the field, Who wears the slavish livery Of town or city, sells his shield Of honor, as his ilk of old Sold body, soul, for British gold. My heroes, comrades of the field, Content ye here; here God to you, Whatever fate or change may yield, Has been most generous and true. Yon everlasting snow-peaks stand His sentinels about this land. Yon bastions of God's house are white As heaven's porch with heaven's peace. Behold His portals bathed in light! Behold at hand the golden fleece! Behold the fatness of the land On every hill, on every hand! Yon bannered snow-peaks point and plead God's upward path, God's upward plan Of peace, God's everlasting creed Of love and brotherhood of man. Thou mantled magistrates in white, Give us His light! Give us His light! AN ANSWER Well! who shall lay hand on my harp but me, Or shall chide my song from the sounding trees? The passionate sun and the resolute sea, These were my masters, and only these. These were my masters, and only these, And these from the first I obey'd, and they Shall command me now, and I shall obey As a dutiful child that is proud to please. There never were measures as true as the sun, The sea hath a song that is passingly sweet, And yet they repeat, and repeat, and repeat, The same old runes though the new years run. By unnamed rivers of the Oregon north, That roll dark-heaved into turbulent hills, I have made my home. ... The wild heart thrills With memories fierce, and a world storms forth. On eminent peaks that are dark with pine, And mantled in shadows and voiced in storms, I have made my camps: majestic gray forms Of the thunder-clouds, they were companions of mine; And face set to face, like to lords austere, Have we talk'd, red-tongued, of the mysteries Of the circling sun, of the oracled seas, While ye who judged me had mantled in fear. Some fragment of thought in the unfinish'd words; A cry of fierce freedom, and I claim no more. What more would you have from the tender of herds And of horse on an ultimate Oregon shore? From men unto God go forth, as alone, Where the dark pines talk in their tones of the sea To the unseen God in a harmony Of the under seas, and know the unknown. LOG CABIN LINES THE SOLDIERS' HOME, WASHINGTON The monument, tipped with electric fire, Blazed high in a halo of light below My low cabin door in the hills that inspire; And the dome of the Capitol gleamed like snow In a glory of light, as higher and higher This wondrous creation of man was sent To challenge the lights of the firmament. A tall man, tawny and spare as bone, With battered old hat and with feet half bare, With the air of a soldier that was all his own— Aye, something more than a soldier's air— Came clutching a staff, with a face like stone; Limped in through my gate—and I thought to beg— Tight clutching a staff, slow dragging a leg. The bent new moon, like a simitar, Kept peace in Heaven. All earth lay still. Some sentinel stars stood watch afar, Some crickets kept clanging along the hill, As the tall, stern relic of blood and war Limped in, and, with hand up to brow half raised, Limped up, looked about, as one dazed or crazed. In the early eighties I built a log cabin in the edge of Washington, to be more in touch with both sides of the Civil War as well as with the smaller republics. And then many noble people who had been ruined in the South were ill content to live in log cabins, as their slaves had lived. I wanted to teach that a log cabin can be made very comfortable, with content at hand. His gaunt face pleading for food and rest, His set lips white as a tale of shame, His black coat tight to a shirtless breast, His black eyes burning in mine-like flame; But never a word from his set lips came As he whipped in line his battered old leg, And his knees made mouths, and as if to beg. Aye! black were his eyes; but doubtful and dim Their vision of beautiful earth, I think. And I doubt if the distant, dear worlds to him Were growing brighter as he neared the brink Of dolorous seas where phantom ships swim. For his face was as hard as the hard, thin hand That clutched that staff like an iron band. “Sir, I am a soldier!” The battered old hat Stood up as he spake, like to one on parade— Stood taller and braver as he spake out that— And the tattered old coat, that was tightly laid To the battered old breast, looked so trim thereat That I knew the mouths of the battered old leg That had opened wide were not made to beg. “I have wandered and wandered this twenty year: Searched up and down for my regiments. Have they gone to that field where no foes appear? Have they pitched in Heaven their cloud-white tents? Or, tell me, my friend, shall I find them here On the hill beyond, at the Soldiers' Home, Where the weary soldiers have ceased to roam? “Aye, I am a soldier and a brigadier; Is this the way to the Soldiers' Home? There is plenty and rest for us all, I hear, And a bugler, bidding us cease to roam, Rides over the hill all the livelong year— Rides calling and calling the brave to come And rest and rest in that Soldiers' Home. “Is this, sir, the way? I wandered in here Just as one oft will at the close of day. Aye, I am a soldier and a brigadier! Now, the Soldiers' Home, sir. Is this the way? I have wandered and wandered this twenty year, Seeking some trace of my regiments Sabered and riddled and torn to rents. “Aye, I am a soldier and a brigadier! A battered old soldier in the dusk of his day; But you don't seem to heed, or you don't seem to hear, Though, meek as I may, I ask for the way To the Soldiers' Home, which must be quite near, While under your oaks, in your easy chair, You sit and you sit, and you stare and you stare. “What battle? What deeds did I do in the fight? Why, sir, I have seen green fields turn as red As yonder red town in that marvelous light! Then the great blazing guns! Then the ghastly white dead— But, tell me, I faint, I must cease to roam! This battered leg aches! Then this sabered old head— Is—is this the way to the Soldiers' Home? “Why, I hear men say 't is a Paradise On the green oak hills by the great red town; That many old comrades shall meet my eyes; That a tasseled young trooper rides up and rides down, With bugle horn blowing to the still blue skies, Rides calling and calling us to rest and to stay In that Soldiers' Home. Sir, is this the way? “My leg is so lame! Then this sabered old head— Ah! pardon me, sir, I never complain; But the road is so rough, as I just now said; And then there is this something that troubles my brain. It makes the light dance from yon Capitol's dome; It makes the road dim as I doubtfully tread— And—sir, is this the way to the Soldiers' Home? “From the first to the last in that desperate war— Why, I did my part. If I did not fall, A hair's breadth measure of this skull-bone scar Was all that was wanting; and then this ball— But what cared I? Ah! better by far Have a sabered old head and a shattered old knee To the end, than not had the praise of Lee— “What! What do I hear? No home there for me? Why, I heard men say that the war was at end! Oh, my head swims so; and I scarce can see! But a soldier's a soldier, I think, my friend, Wherever that soldier may chance to be! And wherever a soldier may chance to roam, Why, a Soldiers' Home is a soldier's home!” He turned as to go; but he sank to the grass; And I lifted my face to the firmament; For I saw a sentinel white star pass, Leading the way the old soldier went. And the light shone bright from the Capitol's dome, Ah, brighter from Washington's monument, Lighting his way to the Soldiers' Home. The Cabin, Washington, D. C. OLIVE Dove-borne symbol, olive bough; Dove-hued sign from God to men, As if still the dove and thou Kept companionship as then. Dove-hued, holy branch of peace, Antique, all-enduring tree; Deluge and the floods surcease— Deluge and Gethsemane. THE BATTLE FLAG AT SHENANDOAH The tented field wore a wrinkled frown, And the emptied church from the hill looked down On the emptied road and the emptied town, That summer Sunday morning. And here was the blue, and there was the gray; And a wide green valley rolled away Between where the battling armies lay, That sacred Sunday morning. And Custer sat, with impatient will, His restless horse, 'mid his troopers still, As he watched with glass from the oak-set hill, That silent Sunday morning. Then fast he began to chafe and to fret; “There's a battle flag on a bayonet Too close to my own true soldiers set For peace this Sunday morning!” “Ride over, some one,” he haughtily said, “And bring it to me! Why, in bars blood red And in stars I will stain it, and overhead Will flaunt it this Sunday morning!” Then a West-born lad, pale-faced and slim, Rode out, and touching his cap to him, Swept down, swept swift as Spring swallows swim, That anxious Sunday morning. On, on through the valley! up, up, anywhere! That pale-faced lad like a bird through the air Kept on till he climbed to the banner there That bravest Sunday morning! And he caught up the flag, and around his waist He wound it tight, and he turned in haste, And swift his perilous route retraced That daring Sunday morning. All honor and praise to the trusty steed! Ah! boy, and banner, and all God speed! God's pity for you in your hour of need This deadly Sunday morning. O, deadly shot! and O, shower of lead! O, iron rain on the brave, bare head! Why, even the leaves from the trees fall dead This dreadful Sunday morning! But he gains the oaks! Men cheer in their might! Brave Custer is laughing in his delight! Why, he is embracing the boy outright This glorious Sunday morning! But, soft! Not a word has the pale boy said. He unwinds the flag. It is starred, striped, red With his heart's best blood; and he falls down dead, In God's still Sunday morning. So, wrap this flag to his soldier's breast: Into stars and stripes it is stained and blest; And under the oaks let him rest and rest Till God's great Sunday morning. THE LOST REGIMENT In a pretty little village of Louisiana destroyed by shells toward the end of the war, on a bayou back from the river, a great number of very old men had been left by their sons and grandsons, while they went to the war. And these old men, many of them veterans of other wars, formed themselves into a regiment, made for themselves uniforms, picked up old flintlock guns, even mounted a rusty old cannon, and so prepared to go to battle if ever the war came within their reach. Toward the close of the war some gunboats came down the river shelling the shore. The old men heard the firing, and, gathering together, they set out with their old muskets and rusty old cannon to try to reach the river over the corduroy road through the cypress swamp. They marched out right merrily that hot day, shouting and bantering to encourage each other, the dim fires of their old eyes burning with desire of battle, although not one of them was young enough to stand erect. And they never came back any more. The shells from the gunboats set the dense and sultry woods on fire. The old men were shut in by the flames—the gray beards and the gray moss and the gray smoke together. The dying land cried; they heard her death-call, These bent old men stopped, listened intent; Then rusty old muskets rushed down from the wall, And squirrel-guns gleamed in that regiment, And grandsires marched, old muskets in hand— The last men left in the old Southland. The gray grandsires! They were seen to reel, Their rusty old muskets a wearisome load; They marched, scarce tall as the cannon's wheel, Marched stooping on up the corduroy road; These gray old boys, all broken and bent, Marched out, the gallant last regiment. But oh! that march through the cypress trees, When zest and excitement had died away! That desolate march through the marsh to the knees— The gray moss mantling the battered and gray— These gray grandsires all broken and bent— The gray moss mantling the regiment. The gray bent men and the mosses gray; The dull dead gray of the uniform! The dull dead skies, like to lead that day, Dull, dead, heavy and deathly warm! Oh, what meant more than the cypress meant, With its mournful moss, to that regiment? That deadly march through the marshes deep! That sultry day and the deeds in vain! The rest on the cypress roots, the sleep— The sleeping never to rise again! The rust on the guns; the rust and the rent— That dying and desolate regiment! The muskets left leaning against the trees, The cannon-wheels clogged from the moss o'erhead, The cypress trees bending on obstinate knees As gray men kneeling by the gray men dead! A lone bird rising, long legged and gray, Slow rising and rising and drifting away. The dank dead mosses gave back no sound, The drums lay silent as the drummers there; The sultry stillness it was so profound You might have heard an unuttered prayer; And ever and ever and far away, Kept drifting that desolate bird in gray. The long gray shrouds of that cypress wood, Like vails that sweep where the gray nuns weep— That cypress moss o'er the dankness deep, Why, the cypress roots they were running blood; And to right and to left lay an old man dead— A mourning cypress set foot and head. 'Twas man hunting men in the wilderness there; 'Twas man hunting man and hunting to slay, But nothing was found but death that day, And possibly God—and that bird in gray Slow rising and rising and drifting away. Now down in the swamp where the gray men fell The fireflies volley and volley at night, And black men belated are heard to tell Of the ghosts in gray in a mimic fight— Of the ghosts of the gallant old men in gray Who silently died in the swamp that day. MISCELLANEOUS LINES THE WORLD IS A BETTER WORLD Aye, the world is a better old world today! And a great good mother this earth of ours; Her white tomorrows are a white stairway To lead us up to the far star flowers— The spiral tomorrows that one by one We climb and we climb in the face of the sun. Aye, the world is a braver old world today! For many a hero dares bear with wrong— Will laugh at wrong and will turn away; Will whistle it down the wind with a song— Dares slay the wrong with his splendid scorn! The bravest old hero that ever was born! TO SAVE A SOUL It seems to me a grandest thing To save the soul from perishing By planting it where heaven's rain May reach and make it grow again. It seems to me the man who leaves The soul to perish is as one Who gathers up the empty sheaves When all the golden grain is done. DOWN THE MISSISSIPPI AT NIGHT Sowing the waves with a fiery rain, Leaving behind us a lane of light, Weaving a web in the woof of night, Cleaving a continent's wealth in twain. Lighting the world with a way of flame, Writing, even as the lightnings write High over the awful arched forehead of night, Jehovah's dread, unutterable name. A NUBIAN FACE ON THE NILE One night we touched the lily shore, And then passed on, in night indeed, Against the far white waterfall. I saw no more, shall know no more Of her for aye. And you who read This broken bit of dream will smile, Half vexed that I saw aught at all. MONTARA Montara, Naples of my West! Montara, Italy to me! Montara, newest, truest, best Of all brave cities by this sea! I'd rather one wee bungalow Where I mid-March may sit me down And watch thy warm waves come and go, Than two whole blocks of Boston town. A CHRISTMAS EVE IN CUBA Their priests are many, for many their sins, Their sins are many, for their land is fair; The perfumed waves and the perfumed winds, The cocoa-palms and the perfumed air; The proud old Dons, so poor and so proud, So poor their ghosts can scarce wear a shroud— This town of Columbus has priests and prayer; And great bells pealing in the palm land. A proud Spanish Don lies shriven and dead; The cross on his breast, a priest at his prayer; His slave at his feet, his son at his head— A slave's white face in her midnight hair; A slave's white face, why, a face as white, As white as that dead man's face this night— This town of Columbus can pray for the dead; Such great bells booming in the palm land. The moon hangs dead up at heaven's white door; As dead as the isle of the great, warm seas; As dead as the Don, so proud and so poor, With two quite close by the bed on their knees; The slave at his feet, the son at his head, And both in tears for the proud man dead— This town of Columbus has tears, if you please; And great bells pealing in the palm land. Aye, both are in tears; for a child might trace In the face of the slave, as the face of the son, The same proud look of the dead man's face— The beauty of one; and the valor of one— The slave at his feet, the son at his head, This night of Christ, where the Don lies dead— This town of Columbus, this land of the sun Keeps great bells clanging in the palm land. The slave is so fair, and so wonderful fair! A statue stepped out from some temple of old; Why, you could entwine your two hands in her hair, Nor yet could encompass its ample, dark fold. And oh, that pitiful, upturned face; Her master lies dead—she knows her place. This town of Columbus has hundreds at prayer, And great bells booming in the palm land. The proud Don dead, and this son his heir; This slave his fortune. Now, what shall he do? Why, what should he do? or what should he care, Save only to cherish a pride as true?— To hide his shame as the good priests hide Black sins confessed when the damned have died. This town of Columbus has pride with her prayer— And great bells pealing in the palm land! Lo! Christ's own hour in the argent seas, And she, his sister, his own born slave! His secret is safe; just master and she; These two, and the dead at the door of the grave ... And death, whatever our other friends do, Why, death, my friend, is a friend most true— This town of Columbus keeps pride and keeps prayer, And her great bells booming everywhere! COMANCHE A blazing home, a blood-soaked hearth; Fair woman's hair with blood upon! That Ishmaelite of all the earth Has like a cyclone, come and gone— His feet are as the blighting dearth; His hands are daggers drawn. “To horse! to horse!” the rangers shout, And red revenge is on his track! The black-haired Bedouin en route Looks like a long, bent line of black. He does not halt nor turn about; He scorns to once look back. But on! right on that line of black, Across the snow-white, sand-sown pass; The bearded rangers on their track Bear thirsty sabers bright as glass. Yet not one red man there looks back; His nerves are braided brass. At last, at last, their mountain came To clasp its children in their flight! Up, up from out the sands of flame They clambered, bleeding to their height; This savage summit, now so tame, Their lone star, that dread night! “Huzzah! Dismount!” the captain cried. “Huzzah! the rovers cease to roam! The river keeps yon farther side, A roaring cataract of foam. They die, they die for those who died Last night by hearth and home!” His men stood still beneath the steep; The high, still moon stood like a nun. The horses stood as willows weep; Their weary heads drooped every one. But no man there had thought of sleep; Each waited for the sun. Vast nun-white moon! Her silver rill Of snow-white peace she ceaseless poured; The rock-built battlement grew still, The deep-down river roared and roared. But each man there with iron will Leaned silent on his sword. Hark! See what light starts from the steep! And hear, ah, hear that piercing sound. It is their lorn death-song they keep In solemn and majestic round. The red fox of these deserts deep At last is run to ground. Oh, it was weird,—that wild, pent horde! Their death-lights, their death-wails each one. The river in sad chorus roared And boomed like some great funeral gun. The while each ranger nursed his sword And waited for the sun. OUR HEROES OF TODAY I With high face held to her ultimate star, With swift feet set to her mountains of gold, This new-built world, where the wonders are, She has built new ways from the ways of old. II Her builders of worlds are workers with hands; Her true world-builders are builders of these, The engines, the plows; writing poems in sands Of gold in our golden Hesperides. III I reckon these builders as gods among men: I count them creators, creators who knew The thrill of dominion, of conquest, as when God set His stars spinning their spaces of blue. IV A song for the groove, and a song for the wheel, And a roaring song for the rumbling car; But away with the pomp of the soldier's steel, And away forever with the trade of war. V The hero of time is the hero of thought; The hero who lives is the hero of peace; And braver his battles than ever were fought, From Shiloh back to the battles of Greece. VI The hero of heroes is the engineer; The hero of height and of gnome-built deep, Whose only fear is the brave man's fear That some one waiting at home might weep. VII The hero we love in this land today Is the hero who lightens some fellow-man's load— Who makes of the mountain some pleasant highway; Who makes of the desert some blossom-sown road. VIII Then hurrah! for the land of the golden downs, For the golden land of the silver horn; Her heroes have built her a thousand towns, But never destroyed her one blade of corn. BY THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI The king of rivers has a dolorous shore, A dreamful dominion of cypress-trees, A gray bird rising forever more, And drifting away toward the Mexican seas— A lone bird seeking for some lost mate, So dolorous, lorn and desolate. The shores are gray as the sands are gray; And gray are the trees in their cloaks of moss;— That gray bird rising and drifting away, Slow dragging its weary long legs across— So weary, just over the gray wood's brink; It wearies one, body and soul to think. These vast gray levels of cypress wood, The gray soldiers' graves; and so, God's will— These cypress-trees' roots are still running blood; The smoke of battle in their mosses still— That gray bird wearily drifting away Was startled some long-since battle day. HER PICTURE I see her now—the fairest thing That ever mocked man's picturing, I picture her as one who drew Aside life's curtain and looked through The mists of all life's mystery As from a wood to open sea. I picture her as one who knew How rare is truth to be untrue— As one who knew the awful sign Of death, of life, of the divine Sweet pity of all loves, all hates, Beneath the iron-footed fates. I picture her as seeking peace, And olive leaves and vine-set land; While strife stood by on either hand, And wrung her tears like rosaries. I picture her in passing rhyme As of, yet not a part of, these— A woman born above her time. The soft, wide eyes of wonderment That trusting looked you through and through; The sweet, arched mouth, a bow new bent, That sent love's arrow swift and true. That sweet, arched mouth! The Orient Hath not such pearls in all her stores, Nor all her storied, spice-set shores Have fragrance such as it hath spent. DEAD IN THE LONG, STRONG GRASS Born to the saddle and bred by a chain of events to ride with the wind until I met the stolid riders of England, I can now see how it was that Anthony Trollope, Lord Houghton and others of the saddle and “meet” gave me ready place in their midst. Not that the English were daring; but they were less fortunate; may I say less experienced. I recall the fact that I once found Lord Houghton's brother, Lord Crewe, and his son also, under the hands of the surgeon, near York—one with a broken thigh, and the other with a few broken ribs. But in all our hard riding I never had a scratch. One morning Trollope hinted that my immunity was due to my big Spanish saddle, which I had brought from Mexico City. I threw my saddle on the grass and rode without so much as a blanket. And I rode neck to neck; and then left them all behind and nearly every one unhorsed. Prince Napoleon was of the party that morning; and as the gentlemen pulled themselves together on the return he kept by my side, and finally proposed a tour through Notts and Sherwood Forest on horseback. And so it fell out that we rode together much. But he had already been persistently trained in the slow military methods, and it was in vain that I tried to teach him to cling to his horse and climb into the saddle as he ran, after the fashion of Indians and vaqueros. He admired it greatly, but seemed to think it unbecoming a soldier. It was at the Literary Fund dinner, where Stanley and Prince Napoleon stood together when they made their speeches, that I saw this brave and brilliant young man for the last time. He was about to set out for Africa with the English troops to take part in the Zulu war. He seemed very serious. When about to separate he took my hand, and, looking me all the time in the face, placed a large diamond on my finger, saying something about its being from the land to which he was going. I refused to take it, for I had heard that the Emperor died poor. But as he begged me to keep it, at least till he should come back, it has hardly left my hand since he placed it there. Piteous that this heir to the throne of France should die alone in the yellow grass at the hand of savages in that same land where the great Emperor had said, “Soldiers, from yonder pyramids twenty centuries behold your deeds.” Dead! stark dead in the long, strong grass! But he died with his sword in his hand. Who says it? who saw it? God saw it! And I knew him! St. George! he would draw it, Though they swooped down in mass Till they darkened the land! Then the seventeen wounds in his breast! Ah! these witness best! Dead! stark dead in the long, strong grass! Dead! and alone in the great dark land! O mother! not Empress now, mother! A nobler name, too, than all other, The laurel leaf fades from thy hand! O mother that waiteth, a mass! Masses and chants must be said, And cypress, instead. GARFIELD Walt Whitman chanced to be in Boston when I last visited Mr. Longfellow, and I was delighted to hear the poet at his table in the midst of his perfect family speak of him most kindly; for at this time the press and all small people were abusing Whitman terribly. Soon after he looked me up at my hotel in Boston, and we two called on the good, gray poet together. I mention this merely to italicize the suggestion that Longfellow's was a large nature. Many others, I know, stood nearer him, so much nearer and dearer, and maybe I ought not to claim the right to say much of a sacred nature; but somehow I always felt, when he reached out his right hand and drew me to him, and looked me fairly and silently in the face with his earnest seer eyes, that he knew me, did not dislike me, and that he knew, soul to soul, we each sought the good and the beautiful and true, each after his fashion, and as best he knew. He had a pretty way of always getting out of the house—that beautiful house of his, where Washington had dwelt—into the woods. He possessed a wonderful lot of books, but he knew the birds, the crickets, the flowers, woods and grasses were more in my way, and with rare delicacy he never talked on books at all, but led out at once, whenever possible, to our mutual friends in the rear of the old Headquarters of Washington. It was on this occasion that a pall of black suddenly fell upon the Republic. Garfield lay dead at Elberon! A publisher solicited from each of the several authors then in and about Boston some tribute of sorrow for the dead. The generous sum of ?100 was checked as an earnest. I remember how John Boyle O'Reilly and I went to big-hearted Walt Whitman and wrestled with him in a vain effort to make him earn and accept his ?100. “Yes, I'm sorry as the sorriest; sympathize with the great broken heart of the world over this dead sovereign citizen. But I've nothing to say.” And so, persuade as we might, even till past midnight, Walt Whitman would not touch the money or try to write a line. He was poor; but bear it forever in testimony that he was honest, and would not promise to sell that which he felt that God had not at that moment given him to sell. And hereafter, whenever any of you are disposed to speak or even think unkindly of Walt Whitman, remember this refusal of his to touch a whole heap of money when he might have had it for ten lines, and maybe less than ten minutes' employment. I love him for it. There is not a butcher, nor a baker, nor a merchant, nor a banker in America, perhaps, who would have been, under the circumstances, so stubbornly, savagely honest with the world and himself. Early next morning I went to Mr. Longfellow in great haste and read my lines. Kindly he listened as I read, and then carefully looked them all over and made some important improvements. He had also partly written, and read me, his poem on the sad theme. But it was too stately and fine for company with our less mature work, and at the last moment it was withheld on the plea that it was still incomplete. It soon after appeared in the New York Independent. As I was hastening away with my manuscript for the press, he said as he came with me down to the gate, that the Queen of England had done more to conquer America by sending the wreath for the funeral of the dead President than all the Georges had ever done with all their troops and cannon. And he said it in such a poetical way that I thought it an unfinished couplet of his poem. I never saw him any more. “Bear me out of the battle, for lo, I am sorely wounded.” From out of the vast, wide-bosomed West, Where gnarled old maples make array, Deep scarred from Redmen gone to rest, Where unnamed heroes hew the way For worlds to follow in their quest, Where pipes the quail, where squirrels play Through tops of trees with nuts for toy, A boy stood forth clear-eyed and tall, A timid boy, a bashful boy, Yet comely as a son of Saul— A boy all friendless, all unknown, Yet heir apparent to a throne: A throne the proudest yet on earth For him who bears him, noblest, best, And this he won by simple worth, That boy from out the wooded West. And now to fall! Pale-browed and prone He lies in everlasting rest. The nations clasp the cold, dead hand; The nations sob aloud at this; The only dry eyes in the land Now at the last we know are his; While she who sends a wreath has won More conquests than her hosts had done. Brave heart, farewell. The wheel has run Full circle, and behold a grave Beneath thy loved old trees is done. The druid oaks look up and wave A solemn beckon back. The brave Old maples welcome, every one. Receive him, earth. In center land, As in the center of each heart, As in the hollow of God's hand, The coffin sinks. And we depart Each on his way, as God deems best To do, and so deserve to rest. HE LOVES AND RIDES AWAY A fig for her story of shame and of pride! She strayed in the night and her feet fell astray; The great Mississippi was glad that day, And that is the reason the poor girl died; The great Mississippi was glad, I say, And splendid with strength in his fierce, full pride— And that is the reason the poor girl died. And that was the reason, from first to last; Down under the dark, still cypresses there. The Father of Waters he held her fast. He kissed her face, he fondled her hair, No more, no more an unloved outcast, He clasped her close to his great, strong breast, Brave lover that loved her last and best: Around and around in her watery world, Down under the boughs where the bank was steep, And cypress trees kneeled all gnarly and curled, Where woods were dark as the waters were deep, Where strong, swift waters were swept and swirled, Where the whirlpool sobbed and sucked in its breath, As some great monster that is choking to death: Where sweeping and swirling around and around That whirlpool eddied so dark and so deep That even a populous world might have drowned, So surging, so vast and so swift its sweep— She rode on the wave. And the trees that weep, The solemn gray cypresses leaning o'er; The roots that ran blood as they leaned from the shore! She surely was drowned! But she should have lain still; She should have lain dead as the dead under ground; She should have kept still as the dead on the hill! But ever and ever she eddied around, And so nearer and nearer she drew me there Till her eyes met mine in their cold dead stare. Then she looked, and she looked as to look me through; And she came so close to my feet on the shore; And her large eyes, larger than ever before, They never grew weary as dead men's do. And her hair! as long as the moss that swept From the cypress trees as they leaned and wept. Then the moon rose up, and she came to see, Her long white fingers slow pointing there; Why, shoulder to shoulder the moon with me On the bank that night, with her shoulders bare, Slow pointing and pointing that white face out, As it swirled and it swirled, and it swirled about. There ever and ever, around and around, Those great sad eyes that refused to sleep! Reproachful sad eyes that had ceased to weep! And the great whirlpool with its gurgling sound! The reproachful dead that was not yet dead! The long strong hair from that shapely head! Her hair was so long! so marvelous long, As she rode and she rode on that whirlpool's breast; And she rode so swift, and she rode so strong, Never to rest as the dead should rest. Oh, tell me true, could her hair in the wave Have grown, as grow dead men's in the grave? For, hist! I have heard that a virgin's hair Will grow in the grave of a virgin true, Will grow and grow in the coffin there, Till head and foot it is filled with hair All silken and soft—but what say you? Yea, tell me truly can this be true? For oh, her hair was so strangely long That it bound her about like a veil of night, With only her pitiful face in sight! As she rode so swift, and she rode so strong, That it wrapped her about, as a shroud had done, A shroud, a coffin, and a veil in one. And oh, that ride on the whirling tide! That whirling and whirling it is in my head, For the eyes of my dead they are not yet dead, Though surely the lady had long since died: Then the mourning wood by the watery grave; The moon's white face to the face in the wave. That moon I shall hate! For she left her place Unasked up in heaven to show me that face. I shall hate forever the sounding tide; For oh, that swirling it is in my head As it swept and it swirled with my dead not dead, As it gasped and it sobbed as a God that had died. AFTER THE BATTLE Sing banners and cannon and roll of drum! The shouting of men and the marshaling! Lo! cannon to cannon and earth struck dumb! Oh, battle, in song, is a glorious thing! Oh, glorious day, riding down to the fight! Oh, glorious battle in story and song! Oh, godlike man to die for the right! Oh, manlike God to revenge the wrong! Yea, riding to battle, on battle day— Why, a soldier is something more than a king! But after the battle! The riding away! Ah, the riding away is another thing! THOSE PERILOUS SPANISH EYES Some fragrant trees, Some flower-sown seas Where boats go up and down, And a sense of rest To the tired breast In this beauteous Aztec town. But the terrible thing in this Aztec town That will blow men's rest to the stormiest skies, Or whether they journey or they lie down— Those perilous Spanish eyes! Snow walls without, Drawn sharp about To prop the sapphire skies! Two huge gate posts, Snow-white like ghosts— Gate posts to paradise! But, oh! turn back from the high-walled town! There is trouble enough in this world, I surmise, Without men riding in regiments down— Oh, perilous Spanish eyes! Mexico City, 1880. NEWPORT NEWS The huge sea monster, the “Merrimac”; The mad sea monster, the “Monitor”; You may sweep the sea, peer forward and back, But never a sign or a sound of war. A vulture or two in the heavens blue; A sweet town building, a boatman's call: The far sea-song of a pleasure crew; The sound of hammers. And that is all. And where are the monsters that tore this main? And where are the monsters that shook this shore? The sea grew mad! And the shore shot flame! The mad sea monsters they are no more. The palm, and the pine, and the sea sands brown; The far sea songs of the pleasure crews; The air like balm in this building town— And that is the picture of Newport News. THE COMING OF SPRING My own and my only Love some night Shall keep her tryst, shall come from the South, And oh, her robe of magnolia white! And oh, and oh, the breath of her mouth! And oh, her grace in the grasses sweet! And oh, her love in the leaves new born! And oh, and oh, her lily-white feet Set daintily down in the dew-wet morn! The drowsy cattle at night shall kneel And give God thanks, and shall dream and rest; The stars slip down and a golden seal Be set on the meadows my Love has blest. Come back, my Love, come sudden, come soon. The world lies waiting as the cold dead lie; The frightened winds wail and the crisp-curled moon Rides, wrapped in clouds, up the cold gray sky. Oh, Summer, my Love, my first, last Love! I sit all day by Potomac here, Waiting and waiting the voice of the dove; Waiting my darling, my own, my dear. The Cabin, Washington, D. C. CHRISTMAS BY THE GREAT RIVER Oh, lion of the ample earth, What sword can cleave thy sinews through? The south forever cradles you; And yet the great North gives you birth. Go find an arm so strong, so sure, Go forge a sword so keen, so true, That it can thrust thy bosom through; Then may this union not endure! In orange lands I lean today Against thy warm tremendous mouth, Oh, tawny lion of the South, To hear what story you shall say. What story of the stormy North, Of frost-bound homes, of babes at play— What tales of twenty States the day You left your lair and leapt forth: The day you tore the mountain's breast And in the icy North uprose, And shook your sides of rains and snows, And rushed against the South to rest: Oh, tawny river, what of they, The far North folk? The maiden sweet— The ardent lover at her feet— What story of thy States today! The river kissed my garment's hem, And whispered as it swept away: “God's story in all States today Is of a babe of Bethlehem.” THOMAS OF TIGRE This was a brave old boyhood friend in the Mount Shasta Days. You will find him there as the Prince in my “Life Among the Modocs,” “Unwritten History, Paquita,” “My Life Among the Indians,” “My Own Story,” or whatever other name enterprising or piratical publishers, Europe or America, may have chosen to give the one prose book Mulford and I put out in London during the Modoc war. This man, Prince Thomas, now of Leon, Nicaragua, was a great favorite and my best friend, in one sense for years in Europe. He had passed the most adventurous life conceivable, at one time having been king of an island. He gloried in the story of his wild life, spent money like a real prince, and was the envy and admiration of fashionable club men. “Where in all the world, and when, did he get so much money?” once asked the president of the Savage Club. “Well, I am not certain whether it was as a pirate of the South Seas or merely as a brigand of Mexico,” I answered. This answer coming to the ears of Thomas, he so far from being angered was greatly pleased and laughed heartily over. It with some friends at Lord Houghton's table. King of Tigre, comrade true Where in all thine isles art thou? Sailing on Fonseca blue? Nearing Amapala now? King of Tigre, where art thou? Battling for Antilles' queen? Saber hilt, or olive bough? Crown of dust, or laurel green? Roving love, or marriage vow? King and comrade, where art thou? Sailing on Pacific seas? Pitching tent in Pimo now? Underneath magnolia trees? Thatch of palm, or cedar bough? Soldier singer, where art thou? Coasting on the Oregon? Saddle bow, or birchen prow? Round the Isles of Amazon? Pampas, plain, or mountain brow? Prince of rovers, where art thou? THE QUEEN OF MY DREAMS I dream'd, O Queen, of you, last night; I can but dream of thee today. But dream? Oh! I could kneel and pray To one, who, like a tender light, Leads ever on my lonesome way, And will not pass—yet will not stay. I dream'd we roam'd in elden land; I saw you walk in splendid state, With lifted head and heart elate, And lilies in your white right hand, Beneath your proud Saint Peter's dome That, silent, lords almighty Rome. A diamond star was in your hair, Your garments were of gold and snow; And men did turn and marvel so, And men did say, How matchless fair! And all men follow'd as you pass'd; But I came silent, lone, and last. And holy men in sable gown, And girt with cord, and sandal shod, Did look to thee, and then to God. They cross'd themselves, with heads held down; They chid themselves, for fear that they Should, seeing thee, forget to pray. Men pass'd, men spake in wooing word; Men pass'd, ten thousand in a line. You stood before the sacred shrine, You stood as if you had not heard. And then you turn'd in calm command, And laid two lilies in my hand. O Lady, if by sea or land You yet might weary of all men, And turn unto your singer then, And lay one lily in his hand, Lo! I would follow true and far As seamen track the polar star. My soul is young, my heart is strong; O Lady, reach a hand today, And thou shalt walk the milky way, For I will give thy name to song. Yea, I am of the kings of thought, And thou shalt live when kings are not. THE POET Yes, I am a dreamer. Yet while you dream, Then I am awake. When a child, back through The gates of the past I peer'd, and I knew The land I had lived in. I saw a broad stream, Saw rainbows that compass'd a world in their reach; I saw my belovéd go down on the beach; Saw her lean to this earth, saw her looking for me As shipmen looked for loved ship at sea. ... While you seek gold in the earth, why, I See gold in the steeps of the starry sky; And which do you think has the fairer view Of God in heaven—the dreamer or you? LINCOLN PARK Unwalled it lies, and open as the sun When God swings wide the dark doors of the East. Oh, keep this one spot, still this one, Where tramp or banker, laymen or high priest, May equal meet before the face of God: Yea, equals stand upon that common sod Where they shall one day equals be Beneath, for aye, and all eternity. THE RIVER OF REST A beautiful stream is the River of Rest; The still, wide waters sweep clear and cold, A tall mast crosses a star in the west, A white sail gleams in the west world's gold: It leans to the shore of the River of Rest— The lily-lined shore of the River of Rest. The boatman rises, he reaches a hand, He knows you well, he will steer you true, And far, so far, from all ills upon land, From hates, from fates that pursue and pursue; Far over the lily-lined River of Rest— Dear mystical, magical River of Rest. A storied, sweet stream is this River of Rest; The souls of all time keep its ultimate shore; And journey you east or journey you west, Unwilling, or willing, sure footed or sore, You surely will come to this River of Rest— This beautiful, beautiful River of Rest. THE NEW PRESIDENT Granite and marble and granite, Corridor, column and dome! A capitol huge as a planet And massive as marble-built Rome. Stair steps of granite to glory! Go up with thy face to the sun; They are stained with the footsteps and story Of giants and battles well won. Stop—stand on this stairway of granite, Lo! Arlington, storied and still, With a lullaby hush. But the land it Springs fresh as that sun-fronted hill. Beneath us stout-hearted Potomac In majesty moves to the sea— Beneath us a sea of proud people Moves on, undivided as he. Yea, strife it is over and ended For all the days under the sun; The banners unite and are blended As moonlight and sunlight in one. Lo! banners and banners and banners, Broad star-balanced banners of blue— If a single star fell from fair heaven, Why, what would befall us think you? MONTGOMERY AT QUEBEC Sword in hand he was slain; The snow his winding sheet; The grinding ice at his feet— The river moaning in pain. Pity and peace at last; Flowers for him today Above on the battlements gray— And the river rolling past. AFRICA Oh! she is very old. I lay, Made dumb with awe and wonderment, Beneath a palm before my tent, With idle and discouraged hands, Not many days ago, on sands Of awful, silent Africa. Long gazing on her ghostly shades, That lift their bare arms in the air, I lay. I mused where story fades From her dark brow and found her fair. A slave, and old, within her veins There runs that warm, forbidden blood That no man dares to dignify In elevated song. The chains That held her race but yesterday Hold still the hands of men. Forbid Is Ethiop. The turbid flood Of prejudice lies stagnant still, And all the world is tainted. Will And wit lie broken as a lance Against the brazen mailéd face Of old opinion. None advance, Steel-clad and glad, to the attack, With trumpet and with song. Look back! Beneath yon pyramids lie hid The histories of her great race. ... Old Nilus rolls right sullen by, With all his secrets. Who shall say: My father rear'd a pyramid; My brother clipp'd the dragon's wings; My mother was Semiramis? Yea, harps strike idly out of place; Men sing of savage Saxon kings New-born and known but yesterday, And Norman blood presumes to say ... Nay, ye who boast ancestral name And vaunt deeds dignified by time Must not despise her. Who hath worn Since time began a face that is So all-enduring, old like this— A face like Africa's? Behold! The Sphinx is Africa. The bond Of silence is upon her. Old And white with tombs, and rent and shorn; With raiment wet with tears, and torn, And trampled on, yet all untamed, All naked now, yet not ashamed,— The mistress of the young world's prime, Whose obelisks still laugh at time, And lift to heaven her fair name, Sleeps satisfied upon her fame. Beyond the Sphinx, and still beyond, Beyond the tawny desert-tomb Of Time; beyond tradition, loom And lifts, ghost-like, from out the gloom, Her thousand cities, battle-torn And gray with story and with Time. Her humblest ruins are sublime; Her thrones with mosses overborne Make velvets for the feet of Time. She points a hand and cries: “Go read The letter'd obelisks that lord Old Rome, and know my name and deed. My archives these, and plunder'd when I had grown weary of all men.” We turn to these; we cry: “Abhorr'd Old Sphinx, behold, we cannot read!” SUMMER MOONS AT MOUNT VERNON Such musky smell of maiden night! Such bridal bough, like orange tree! Such wondrous stars! Yon lily moon Seems like some long-lost afternoon! More perfect than a string of pearls We hold the full days of the year; The days troop by like flower girls, And all the days are ours here. Here youth must learn; here age may live Full tide each day the year can give. No frosted wall, no frozen hasp, Shuts Nature's book from us today; Her palm leaves lift too high to clasp; Her college walls, the milky way. The light is with us! Read and lead! The larger book, the loftier deed! THE POEM BY THE POTOMAC Two or three hundred steps to the right and up a general incline and you stand on the board, high porch of Mount Vernon. A great river creeps close underneath one hundred feet below. You might suppose you could throw a stone, standing on the porch, into the Potomac, as seen through the trees that hug the hillside and the water's bank below. All was quiet, so quiet. Now and then a barnyard fowl, back in the rear, strained his glossy neck and called out loud and clear in the eternal Sabbath here; a fine shaggy dog wallowed and romped about the grassy dooryard, while far out over the vast river some black, wide-winged birds kept circling round and round. I went back and around into the barnyard to inquire what kind of birds they were. I met a very respectful but very stammery negro here. He took his cap in his hand, and twisting it all about and opening his mouth many times, he finally said: “Do-do-dose burds was created by de Lord to p-p-pu-purify de yearth.” “But what do you call them, uncle?” “Tur-tur-tur,” and he twisted his cap, backed out, came forward, winked his eyes, but could not go on. “Do you mean turkey buzzards?” “Ya-ya-yas, sah, do-do-dose burds eats up de carrion ob de yearth, sah.” Down yonder is the tomb, the family vault. Back in the rear of the two marble coffins about thirty of the Washington family lie. The vault is locked up and closed forever. The key has been thrown into the trusty old Potomac to lie there until the last trump shall open all tombs. Let no one hereafter complain of having to live in a garret alone and without a fire. For here, with all this spacious and Noble house to select from, the widow of Washington chose a garret looking to the south and out upon his tomb. This is the old tomb where he was first laid to rest and where the fallen oak leaves are crowding in heaps now and almost filling up the low, dark doorway. This garret has but one window, a small and narrow dormer window, and is otherwise quite dark. A bottom corner of the door is cut away so that her cat might come and go at will. And this is the saddest, tenderest sight at Mount Vernon. It seemed to me that I could see this noble lady sitting here, looking out upon the tomb of her mighty dead, the great river sweeping fast beyond, her heart full of the memory of a mighty Nation's birth, waiting, waiting, waiting. The thing, however, of the most singular interest here is a key of the Bastile, presented by Thomas Paine to Lafayette, who brought it to America and presented it to Mount Vernon. It hangs here in a glass case, massive and monstrous. It is a hideous, horrible thing, and has, perhaps, more blood and misery on it than ony other piece of iron or steel that was ever seen. Paine! The Prison of France! Lafayette! The Bastile key to our Washington, Whose feet on the neck of tyrants set Shattered their prisons every one. The key hangs here on his white walls high, That all shall see, that none shall forget What tyrants have been, what they may be yet; And the Potomac rolling by. On Washington's walls let it rust and rust, And tell its story of blood and of tears, That Time still holds to the Poet's trust, To people his pages for years and years. The monstrous shape on the white walls high, Like a thief in chains let it rot and rust— Its kings and adorers crowned in dust: And the Potomac rolling by. A DEAD CARPENTER What shall be said of this soldier now dead? This builder, this brother, now resting forever? What shall be said of this soldier who bled Through thirty-three years of silent endeavor? Why, name him thy hero! Yea, write his name down As something far nobler, as braver by far Than purple-robed Cæsar of battle-torn town When bringing home glittering trophies of war. Oh, dark somber pines of my starlit Sierras, Be silent of song, for the master is mute! The Carpenter, master, is dead and lo! there is Silence of song upon nature's draped lute! Brother! Oh, manly dead brother of mine! My brother by toil 'mid the toiling and lowly, My brother by sign of this hard hand, by sign Of toil, and hard toil, that the Christ has made holy: Yea, brother of all the brave millions that toil; Brave brother in patience and silent endeavor, Rest on, as the harvester rich from his soil, Rest you, and rest you for ever and ever. QUESTION? In the days when my mother, the Earth, was young, And you all were not, nor the likeness of you, She walk'd in her maidenly prime among The moonlit stars in the boundless blue. Then the great sun lifted his shining shield, And he flash'd his sword as the soldiers do, And he moved like a king full over the field, And he looked, and he loved her brave and true. And looking afar from the ultimate rim, As he lay at rest in a reach of light, He beheld her walking alone at night, When the buttercup stars in their beauty swim. So he rose up flush'd in his love, and he ran, And he reach'd his arms, and round her waist He wound them strong like a love-struck man, And he kiss'd and embraced her, brave and chaste. So he nursed his love like a babe at its birth, And he warm'd in his love as the long years ran, Then embraced her again, and sweet mother Earth Was a mother indeed, and her child was man. The sun is the sire, the mother is earth! What more do you know? what more do I need? The one he begot, and the one gave birth, And I love them both, and let laugh at your creed. And who shall say I am all unwise In my great, warm faith? Time answers us not: The quick fool questions; but who replies? The wise man hesitates, hushed in thought. BOSTON TO THE BOERS My first, best friends were British. They still are, and so far from finding fault that I favor the Boers, they exult that I dare for the right. They are the better class of British. England's best friends to-day are those who deplore this assault on the farmer Boers, so like ourselves a century back. Could any man be found strong enough to stay her hand, with sword or pen, in this mad hour, that man would deserve her lasting gratitude. This feeling holds in England as well as here. Take for example the following from her ablest thinker to a friend in America:— “I rejoice that you and others are bent on showing that there are some among us who think the national honor is not being enhanced by putting down the weak. Would that age and ill health did not prevent me from aiding. No one can deny that at the time of the Jameson Raid the aim of the Outlanders and the raiders was to usurp the Transvaal government, and he must be willfully blind who does not see what the Outlanders failed to do by bullets they hope presently to do by votes, and only those who, while jealous of their own independence, regard but little the independence of people who stand in their way, can fail to sympathize with the Boers in their resistance to political extinction. It is sad to see our government backing those whose avowed policy is expansion, which, less politely expressed, means aggression, or which there is a still less polite word readily guessed. On behalf of these, the big British Empire, weapon in hand, growls out to the little Boer republic, ‘Do as I bid you.’ I have always thought that nobleness is shown in treating tenderly those who are relatively feeble and even sacrificing on their behalf something to which there is a just claim. But if current opinion is right, I must have been wrong.— Herbert Spencer.” “For the right that needs assistance, For the wrong that needs resistance, For the glory in the distance, For the good that we can do.” “For Freedom's battles once begun, Bequeathed from bleeding sire to son, Though baffled oft, are ever won.”— Byron. The Sword of Gideon, Sword of God, Be with ye, Boers. Brave men of peace, Ye hewed the path, ye brake the sod, Ye fed white flocks of fat increase, Where Saxon foot had never trod; Where Saxon foot unto this day Had measured not, had never known, Had ye not bravely led the way And made such happy homes your own. I think God's house must be such home. The priestess Mother, choristers Who spin and weave, nor care to roam Beyond this white God's house of hers, But spinning sing and spin again. I think such silent shepherd men Most like that few the prophet sings— Most like that few stout Abram drew Triumphant o'er the slaughtered kings. Defend God's house! Let fall the crook. Draw forth the plowshare from the sod, And trust, as in the Holy Book, The Sword of Gideon and of God; God and the right! Enough to fight A million regiments of wrong. Defend! Nor count what comes of it. God's battle bides not with the strong; And pride must fall. Lo! it is writ! Great England's Gold! how stanch she fares, Fame's wine-cup pressing her proud lips— Her checker-board of battle squares Rimmed round by steel-built battle-ships! And yet meanwhiles ten thousand miles She seeks ye out. Well, welcome her! Give her such welcome with such will As Boston gave in battle's whir That red, dread day at Bunker Hill. ST. PAUL'S I see above a crowded world a cross Of gold. It grows like some great cedar tree Upon a peak in shroud of cloud and moss, Made bare and bronzed in far antiquity. Stupendous pile! The grim Yosemite Has rent apart his granite wall, and thrown Its rugged from before us. ... Here I see The strides of giant men in cryptic stone, And turn, and slow descend where sleep the great alone. The mighty captains have come home to rest; The brave returned to sleep amid the brave. The sentinel that stood with steely breast Before the fiery hosts of France, and gave The battle-cry that roll'd, receding wave On wave, the foeman flying back and far, Is here. How still! Yet louder now the grave Than ever-crashing Belgian battle-car Or blue and battle-shaken seas of Trafalgar. The verger stalks in stiff importance o'er The hollow, deep and strange responding stones; He stands with lifted staff unchid before The forms that once had crush'd or fashion'd thrones, And coldly points you out the coffin'd bones: He stands composed where armies could not stand A little time before. ... The hand disowns The idle sword, and now instead the grand And golden cross makes sign and takes austere command. WESTMINSTER ABBEY The Abbey broods beside the turbid Thames; Her mother heart is filled with memories; Her every niche is stored with storied names; They move before me like a mist of seas. I am confused, and made abash'd by these Most kingly souls, grand, silent, and severe. I am not equal, I should sore displease The living ... dead. I dare not enter; drear And stain'd in storms of grander days all things appear. I go! but shall I not return again When art has taught me gentler, kindlier skill, And time has given force and strength of strain? I go! O ye that dignify and fill The chronicles of earth! I would instil Into my soul somehow the atmosphere Of sanctity that here usurps the will; But go; I seek the tomb of one—a peer Of peers—whose dust a fool refused to cherish here. AT LORD BYRON'S TOMB O Master, here I bow before a shrine; Before the lordliest dust that ever yet Moved animate in human form divine. Lo! dust indeed to dust. The mold is set Above thee and the ancient walls are wet, And drip all day in dank and silent gloom, As if the cold gray stones could not forget Thy great estate shrunk to this somber room, But lean to weep perpetual tears above thy tomb. Before me lie the oak-crown'd Annesley hills, Before me lifts the ancient Annesley Hall Above the mossy oaks. ... A picture fills With forms of other days. A maiden tall And fair; a fiery restless boy, with all The force of man! a steed that frets without; A long thin sword that rusts upon the wall. ... The generations pass. ... Behold! about The ivied hall the fair-hair'd children sport and shout. A bay wreath, wound by Ina of the West, Hangs damp and stain'd upon the dark gray wall, Above thy time-soil'd tomb and tatter'd crest; A bay wreath gather'd by the seas that call To orient Cathay, that break and fall On shell-lined shores before Tahiti's breeze. A slab, a crest, a wreath, and these are all Neglected, tatter'd, torn; yet only these The world bestows for song that rivall'd singing seas. A bay-wreath wound by one more truly brave Than Shastan; fair as thy eternal fame, She sat and wove above the sunset wave, And wound and sang thy measures and thy name. 'Twas wound by one, yet sent with one acclaim By many, fair and warm as flowing wine, And purely true, and tall as growing flame, That list and lean in moonlight's mellow shine To tropic tales of love in other tongues than thine. I bring this idle reflex of thy task, And my few loves, to thy forgotten tomb; I leave them here; and here all pardon ask Of thee, and patience ask of singers whom Thy majesty hath silenced. I resume My staff, and now my face is to the West; My feet are worn; the sun is gone, a gloom Has mantled Hucknall, and the minstrel's zest For fame is broken here, and here he pleads for rest. ENGLAND Thou, mother of brave men, of nations! Thou, The white-brow'd Queen of bold white-bearded Sea! Thou wert of old ever the same as now, So strong, so weak, so tame, so fierce, so bound, so free, A contradiction and a mystery; Serene, yet passionate, in ways thine own. Thy brave ships wind and weave earth's destiny. The zones of earth, aye, thou hast set and sown All seas in bed of blossom'd sail, as some great garden blown. RIEL, THE REBEL He died at dawn in the land of snows; A priest at the left, a priest at the right; The doomed man praying for his pitiless foes, And each priest holding a low dim light, To pray for the soul of the dying. But Windsor Castle was far away; And Windsor Castle was never so gay With her gorgeous banners flying! The hero was hung in the windy dawn— 'Twas splendidly done, the telegraph said; A creak of the neck, then the shoulders drawn; A heave of the breast—and the man hung dead, And, oh! never such valiant dying! While Windsor Castle was far away With its fops and fools on that windy day, And its thousand banners flying! THE DEFENSE OF THE ALAMO Santa Ana came storming, as a storm might come; There was rumble of cannon; there was rattle of blade; There was cavalry, infantry, bugle and drum— Full seven proud thousand in pomp and parade, The chivalry, flower of all Mexico; And a gaunt two hundred in the Alamo! And thirty lay sick, and some were shot through; For the siege had been bitter, and bloody, and long. “Surrender, or die!”—“Men, what will you do?” And Travis, great Travis, drew sword, quick and strong; Drew a line at his feet. ... Will you come? Will you go? I die with my wounded, in the Alamo.” Then Bowie gasped, “Guide me over that line!” Then Crockett, one hand to the sick, one hand to his gun, Crossed with him; then never a word or a sign Till all, sick or well, all, all, save but one, One man. Then a woman stopped praying, and slow Across, to die with the heroes of the Alamo. Then that one coward fled, in the night, in that night When all men silently prayed and thought Of home; of tomorrow; of God and the right; Till dawn; then Travis sent his single last cannon-shot, In answer to insolent Mexico, From the old bell-tower of the Alamo. Then came Santa Ana; a crescent of flame! Then the red escalade; then the fight hand to hand: Such an unequal fight as never had name Since the Persian hordes butchered that doomed Spartan band. All day—all day and all night, and the morning? so slow, Through the battle smoke mantling the Alamo. Then silence! Such silence! Two thousand lay dead In a crescent outside! And within? Not a breath Save the gasp of a woman, with gory, gashed head, All alone, with her dead there, waiting for death; And she but a nurse. Yet when shall we know Another like this of the Alamo? Shout “Victory, victory, victory ho!” I say, 'tis not always with the hosts that win; I say that the victory, high or low, Is given the hero who grapples with sin, Or legion or single; just asking to know When duty fronts death in his Alamo. TOMORROW O thou Tomorrow! Mystery! O day that ever runs before! What hast thine hidden hand in store For mine, Tomorrow, and for me? O thou Tomorrow! what hast thou In store to make me bear the Now? O day in which we shall forget The tangled troubles of today! O day that laughs at duns, at debt! O day of promises to pay! O shelter from all present storm! O day in which we shall reform! O days of all days to reform! Convenient day of promises! Hold back the shadow of the storm. Let not thy mystery be less, O bless'd Tomorrow! chiefest friend, But lead us blindfold to the end. FINALE Ah me! I mind me long agone, Once on a savage snow-bound height We pigmies pierced a king. Upon His bare and upreared breast till night We rained red arrows and we rained Hot lead. Then up the steep and slow He passed; yet ever still disdained To strike, or even look below. We found him, high above the clouds next morn And dead, in all his silent, splendid scorn. So leave me, as the edge of night Comes on a little time to pass, Or pray. For steep the stony height And torn by storm, and bare of grass Or blossom. And when I lie dead Oh, do not drag me down once more. For Jesus' sake let my poor head Lie pillowed with these stones. My store Of wealth is these. I earned them. Let me keep Still on alone, on mine own star-lit steep. TO JUANITA You will come my bird, Bonita? Come! For I by steep and stone Have built such nest for you, Juanita, As not eagle bird hath known. Rugged! Rugged as Parnassus! Rude, as all roads I have trod— Yet are steeps and stone-strewn passes Smooth o'er head, and nearest God. Here black thunders of my cañon Shake its walls in Titan wars! Here white sea-born clouds companion With such peaks as know the stars! Here madrona, manzanita— Here the snarling chaparral House and hang o'er steeps, Juanita, Where the gaunt wolf loved to dwell! Dear, I took these trackless masses Fresh from Him who fashioned them; Wrought in rock, and hewed fair passes, Flower set, as sets a gem. Aye, I built in woe. God willed it; Woe that passeth ghosts of guilt; Yet I built as His birds builded— Builded, singing as I built. All is finished! Roads of flowers Wait your loyal little feet. All completed? Nay, the hours Till you come are incomplete. Steep below me lies the valley, Deep below me lies the town, Where great sea-ships ride and rally, And the world walks up and down. O, the sea of lights far streaming When the thousand flags are furled— When the gleaming bay lies dreaming As it duplicates the world! You will come, my dearest, truest? Come my sovereign queen of ten; My blue skies will then be bluest; My white rose be whitest then: Then the song! Ah, then the saber Flashing up the walls of night! Hate of wrong and love of neighbor— Rhymes of battle for the Right! The Hights, Cal. SEMI-HUMOROUS SONGS The dower of song is, to my mind, a sacred gift. The prophet and the seer should rise above the levities of this life. And so it is that I make humble apology for now gathering up from recitation books these next half dozen pieces. The only excuse for doing it is their refusal to die; even under the mutilations of the compilers of “choice selections.” IN CLASSIC SHADES Alone and sad I sat me down To rest on Rousseau's narrow isle Below Geneva. Mile on mile, And set with many a shining town, Tow'rd Dent du Midi danced the wave Beneath the moon. Winds went and came And fanned the stars into a flame. I heard the far lake, dark and deep, Rise up and talk as in its sleep; I heard the laughing waters lave And lap against the further shore, An idle oar, and nothing more Save that the isle had voice, and save That 'round about its base of stone There plashed and flashed the foamy Rhone. A stately man, as black as tan, Kept up a stern and broken round Among the strangers on the ground. I named that awful African A second Hannibal. I gat My elbows on the table; sat With chin in upturned palm to scan His face, and contemplate the scene. The moon rode by, a crownéd queen. I was alone. Lo! not a man To speak my mother tongue. Ah me! How more than all alone can be A man in crowds! Across the isle My Hannibal strode on. The while Diminished Rousseau sat his throne Of books, unnoticed and unknown. This strange, strong man, with face austere, At last drew near. He bowed; he spake In unknown tongues. I could but shake My head. Then half achill with fear, Arose, and sought another place. Again I mused. The kings of thought Came by, and on that storied spot I lifted up a tearful face. The star-set Alps they sang a tune Unheard by any soul save mine. Mont Blanc, as lone and as divine And white, seemed mated to the moon. The past was mine; strong-voiced and vast— Stern Calvin, strange Voltaire, and Tell, And two whose names are known too well To name, in grand procession passed. And yet again came Hannibal; King-like he came, and drawing near, I saw his brow was now severe And resolute. In tongue unknown Again he spake. I was alone, Was all unarmed; was worn and sad; But now, at last, my spirit had Its old assertion. I arose, As startled from a dull repose; With gathered strength I raised a hand And cried, “I do not understand.” His black face brightened as I spake; He bowed; he wagged his woolly head; He showed his shining teeth, and said, “Sah, if you please, dose tables heah Am consecrate to lager beer; And, sah, what will you have to take?” Not that I loved that colored cuss— Nay! he had awed me all too much— But I sprang forth, and with a clutch I grasped his hand, and holding thus, Cried, “Bring my country's drink for two!” For oh! that speech of Saxon sound To me was as a fountain found In wastes, and thrilled me through and through. On Rousseau's isle, in Rousseau's shade, Two pink and spicy drinks were made, In classic shades, on classic ground, We stirred two cocktails round and round. THAT GENTLE MAN FROM BOSTON AN IDYL OF OREGON Two noble brothers loved a fair Young lady, rich and good to see; And oh, her black abundant hair! And oh, her wondrous witchery! Her father kept a cattle farm, These brothers kept her safe from harm: From harm of cattle on the hill; From thick-necked bulls loud bellowing The livelong morning, long and shrill, And lashing sides like anything! From roaring bulls that tossed the sand And pawed the lilies of the land. There came a third young man. He came From far and famous Boston town. He was not handsome, was not “game,” But he could “cook a goose” as brown As any man that set foot on The mist kissed shores of Oregon. This Boston man he taught the school, Taught gentleness and love alway, Said love and kindness, as a rule, Would ultimately “make it pay.” He was so gentle, kind, that he Could make a noun and verb agree. So when one day these brothers grew All jealous and did strip to fight, He gently stood between the two And meekly told them 'twas not right. “I have a higher, better plan,” Outspake this gentle Boston man. “My plan is this: Forget this fray About that lily hand of hers; Go take your guns and hunt all day High up yon lofty hill of firs, And while you hunt, my ruffled doves, Why, I will learn which one she loves.” The brothers sat the windy hill, Their hair shone yellow, like spun gold, Their rifles crossed their laps, but still They sat and sighed and shook with cold. Their hearts lay bleeding far below; Above them gleamed white peaks of snow. Their hounds lay crouching slim and neat, A spotted circle in the grass. The valley lay beneath their feet; They heard the wide-winged eagles pass. Two eagles cleft the clouds above; Yet what could they but sigh and love? “If I could die,” the elder sighed, “My dear young brother here might wed.” “Oh, would to heaven I had died!” The younger sighed with bended head. Then each looked each full in the face And each sprang up and stood in place. “If I could die”—the elder spake,— “Die by your hand, the world would say 'Twas accident—; and for her sake, Dear brother, be it so, I pray.” “Not that!” the younger nobly said; Then tossed his gun and turned his head. And fifty paces back he paced! And as he paced he drew the ball; Then sudden stopped and wheeled and faced His brother to the death and fall! Two shots rang wild upon the air! But lo! the two stood harmless there! Two eagles poised high in the air; Far, far below the bellowing Of bullocks ceased, and everywhere Vast silence sat all questioning. The spotted hounds ran circling round, Their red, wet noses to the ground. And now each brother came to know That each had drawn the deadly ball; And for that fair girl far below Had sought in vain to silent fall. And then the two did gladly “shake,” And thus the elder gravely spake: “Now let us run right hastily And tell the kind schoolmaster all! Yea! yea! and if she choose not me, But all on you her favors fall, This valiant scene, till all life ends, Dear brother, binds us best of friends. The hounds sped down, a spotted line, The bulls in tall abundant grass Shook back their horns from bloom and vine, And trumpeted to see them pass— They loved so good, they loved so true, These brothers scarce knew what to do. They sought the kind schoolmaster out As swift as sweeps the light of morn— They could but love, they could not doubt This man so gentle, “in a horn,” They cried: “Now whose the lily hand— That lady's of this emer'ld land?” They bowed before that big-nosed man, That long-nosed man from Boston town; They talked as only lovers can, They talked, but he would only frown; And still they talked and still they plead; It was as pleading with the dead. At last this Boston man did speak— “Her father has a thousand ceows, An hundred bulls, all fat and sleek; He also had this ample heouse.” The brothers' eyes stuck out thereat So far you might have hung your hat. “I liked the looks of this big heouse— My lovely boys, won't you come in? Her father had a thousand ceows— He also had a heap o' tin. The guirl? Oh yes, the guirl, you see— The guirl, this morning married me.” WILLIAM BROWN OF OREGON They called him Bill, the hired man, But she, her name was Mary Jane, The squire's daughter; and to reign The belle from Ber-she-be to Dan Her little game. How lovers rash Got mittens at the spelling school! How many a mute, inglorious fool Wrote rhymes and sighed and dyed—mustache? This hired man had loved her long, Had loved her best and first and last, Her very garments as she passed For him had symphony and song. So when one day with flirt and frown She called him “Bill,” he raised his head, He caught her eye and faltering said, “I love you; and my name is Brown,” She fairly waltzed with rage; she wept; You would have thought the house on fire. She told her sire, the portly squire, Then smelt her smelling-salts and slept. Poor William did what could be done; He swung a pistol on each hip, He gathered up a great ox-whip And drove right for the setting sun. He crossed the big backbone of earth, He saw the snowy mountains rolled Like mighty billows; saw the gold Of great big sunsets; felt the birth Of sudden dawn upon the plain; And every night did William Brown Eat pork and beans and then lie down And dream sweet dreams of Mary Jane. Her lovers passed. Wolves hunt in packs, They sought for bigger game; somehow They seemed to see about her brow The forky signs of turkey tracks. The teter-board of life goes up, The teter-board of life goes down, The sweetest face must learn to frown; The biggest dog has been a pup. O maidens! pluck not at the air; The sweetest flowers I have found Grow rather close unto the ground And highest places are most bare. Why, you had better win the grace Of one poor cussed Af-ri-can Than win the eyes of every man In love alone with his own face. At last she nursed her true desire. She sighed, she wept for William Brown. She watched the splendid sun go down Like some great sailing ship on fire, Then rose and checked her trunks right on; And in the cars she lunched and lunched, And had her ticket punched and punched, Until she came to Oregon. She reached the limit of the lines, She wore blue specs upon her nose, Wore rather short and manly clothes, And so set out to reach the mines. Her right hand held a Testament, Her pocket held a parasol, And thus equipped right on she went, Went water-proof and water-fall. She saw a miner gazing down, Slow stirring something with a spoon; “O, tell me true and tell me soon, What has become of William Brown?” He looked askance beneath her specs, Then stirred his cocktail round and round, Then raised his head and sighed profound, And said, “He's handed in his checks.” Then care fed on her damaged cheek, And she grew faint, did Mary Jane, And smelt her smelling salts in vain, Yet wandered on, way-worn and weak. At last upon a hill alone; She came, and there she sat her down; For on that hill there stood a stone, And, lo! that stone read, “William Brown.” “O William Brown! O William Brown! And here you rest at last,” she said, “With this lone stone above your head, And forty miles from any town! I will plant cypress trees, I will, And I will build a fence around, And I will fertilize the ground With tears enough to turn a mill.” She went and got a hired man, She brought him forty miles from town, And in the tall grass squatted down And bade him build as she should plan. But cruel cowboys with their bands They saw, and hurriedly they ran And told a bearded cattle man Somebody builded on his lands. He took his rifle from the rack, He girt himself in battle pelt, He stuck two pistols in his belt, And mounting on his horse's back, He plunged ahead. But when they shewed A woman fair, about his eyes He pulled his hat, and he likewise Pulled at his beard, and chewed and chewed. At last he gat him down and spake: “O lady, dear, what do you here?” “I build a tomb unto my dear, I plant sweet flowers for his sake.” The bearded man threw his two hands Above his head, then brought them down And cried, “O, I am William Brown, And this the corner-stone of my lands!” And the Prince married her and they lived happy ever after. HORACE GREELEY'S DRIVE The old stage-drivers of the brave old days! The old stage-drivers with their dash and trust! These old stage-drivers they have gone their ways But their deeds live on, though their bones are dust; And many brave tales are told and retold Of these daring men in the days of old: Of honest Hank Monk and his Tally-Ho, When he took good Horace in his stage to climb The high Sierras with their peaks of snow And 'cross to Nevada, “and come in on time;” But the canyon below was so deep—oh! so deep— And the summit above was so steep—oh! so steep! The horses were foaming. The summit ahead Seemed as far as the stars on a still, clear night. And steeper and steeper the narrow route led Till up to the peaks of perpetual white; But faithful Hank Monk, with his face to the snow, Sat silent and stern on his Tally-Ho! Sat steady and still, sat faithful and true To the great, good man in his charge that day; Sat vowing the man and the mail should “go through On time” though he bursted both brace and stay; Sat silently vowing, in face of the snow, He'd “get in on time” with his Tally-Ho! But the way was so steep and so slow—oh! so slow! 'T was silver below, and the bright silver peak Was silver above in its beauty and glow. An eagle swooped by, Hank saw its hooked beak; When, sudden out-popping a head snowy white— “Mr. Monk, I must lecture in Nevada tonight!” With just one thought that the mail must go through; With just one word to the great, good man— But weary—so weary—the creaking stage drew As only a weary old creaking stage can— When again shot the head; came shrieking outright: “Mr. Monk, I MUST lecture in Nevada tonight!” Just then came the summit! And the far world below, It was Hank Monk's world. But he no word spake; He pushed back his hat to that fierce peak of snow! He threw out his foot to the eagle and brake! He threw out his silk! He threw out his reins! And the great wheels reeled as if reeling snow skeins! The eagle was lost in his crag up above! The horses flew swift as the swift light of morn! The mail must go through with its message of love, The miners were waiting his bright bugle horn. The man must go through! And Monk made a vow As he never had failed, why, he wouldn't fail now! How his stage spun the pines like a far spider's web! It was spider and fly in the heavens up there! And the clanging of hoofs made the blood flow and ebb, For 'twas death in the breadth of a wheel or a hair. Once more popped the head, and the piping voice cried: “Mr. Monk! Mr. Monk!” But no Monk replied! Then the great stage it swung, as if swung from the sky; Then it dipped like a ship in the deep jaws of death; Then the good man he gasped as men gasping for breath, When they deem it is coming their hour to die. And again shot the head, like a battering ram, And the face it was red, and the words they were hot: “Mr. Monk! Mr. Monk! I don't care a (mill?) dam. Whether I lecture in Nevada or not!” THAT FAITHFUL WIFE OF IDAHO Huge silver snow-peaks, white as wool, Huge, sleek, fat steers knee deep in grass, And belly deep, and belly full, Their flower beds one fragrant mass Of flowers, grass tall-born and grand, Where flowers chase the flying snow! Oh, high held land in God's right hand, Delicious, dreamful Idaho! We rode the rolling cow-sown hills, That bearded cattle man and I; Below us laughed the blossomed rills, Above the dappled clouds blew by. We talked. The topic? Guess. Why, sir, Three-fourths of all men's time they keep To talk, to think, to be of HER; The other fourth they give to sleep. To learn what he might know, or how, I laughed all constancy to scorn. “Behold yon happy, changeful cow! Behold this day, all storm at morn, Yet now 'tis changed by cloud and sun, Yea, all things change—the heart, the head, Behold on earth there is not one That changeth not in love,” I said. He drew a glass, as if to scan The steeps for steers; raised it and sighed. He craned his neck, this cattle man, Then drove the cork home and replied: “For twenty years (forgive these tears), For twenty years no word of strife— I have not known for twenty years One folly from my faithful wife.” I looked that tarn man in the face— That dark-browed, bearded cattle man. He pulled his beard, then dropped in place A broad right hand, all scarred and tan, And toyed with something shining there Above his holster, bright and small. I was convinced. I did not care To agitate his mind at all. But rest I could not. Know I must The story of my stalwart guide; His dauntless love, enduring trust; His blesséd and most wondrous bride. I wondered, marveled, marveled much; Was she of Western growth? Was she Of Saxon blood, that wife with such Eternal truth and constancy? I could not rest until I knew— “Now twenty years, my man,” I said, “Is a long time.” He turned, he drew A pistol forth, also a sigh. “'Tis twenty years or more,” sighed he. “Nay, nay, my honest man, I vow I do not doubt that this may be; But tell, oh! tell me truly how?” “'Twould make a poem, pure and grand; All time should note it near and far; And thy fair, virgin, gold-sown land Should stand out like some winter star. America should heed. And then The doubtful French beyond the sea— 'Twould make them truer, nobler men To know how this might truly be.” “'Tis twenty years or more, urged he; “Nay, that I know, good guide of mine; But lead me where this wife may be, And I a pilgrim at a shrine, And kneeling as a pilgrim true”— He, leaning, shouted loud and clear: “I cannot show my wife to you; She's dead this more than twenty year.” SARATOGA AND THE PSALMIST These famous waters smell like—well, Those Saratoga waters may Taste just a little of the day Of judgment; and the sulphur smell Suggests, along with other things, A climate rather warm for springs. But restful as a twilight song, The land where every lover hath A spring, and every spring a path To lead love pleasantly along. Oh, there be waters, not of springs— The waters wise King David sings. Sweet is the bread that lovers eat In secret, sang on harp of gold, Jerusalem's high king of old. “The stolen waters they are sweet!” Oh, dear, delicious piracies Of kisses upon love's high seas! The old traditions of our race Repeat for aye and still repeat; The stolen waters still are sweet As when King David sat in place, All purple robed and crowned in gold, And sang his holy psalms of old. Oh, to escape the searching sun; To seek these waters over sweet; To see her dip her dimpled feet Where these delicious waters run— To dip her feet, nor slip nor fall, Nor stain her garment's hem at all: Nor soil the whiteness of her feet, Nor stain her whitest garment's hem— Oh, singer of Jerusalem, You sang so sweet, so wisely sweet! Shake hands! shake hands! I guess you knew For all your psalms, a thing or two. A TURKEY HUNT IN TEXAS (AS TOLD AT DINNER.) “No, sir; no turkey for me, sir. But soft, place it there, Lest friends may make question and strangers may stare. Ah, the thought of that hunt in the cañon, the blood— Nay, gently, please, gently! You open a flood Of memories, memories melting me so That I rise in my place and—excuse me—I go, No? You must have the story? And you, lady fair? And you, and you all? Why, it's blood and despair; And 'twere not kind in me, not manly or wise To bring tears at such time to such beautiful eyes. I remember me now the last time I told This story a Persian in diamonds and gold Sat next to good Gladstone, there was Wales to the right, Then a Duke, then an Earl, and such ladies in white! But I stopped, sudden stopped, lest the story might start The blood freezing back to each feminine heart. But they all said, “The story!” just as you all have said, And the great Persian monarch he nodded his head Till his diamond-decked feathers fell, glittered and rose, Then nodded almost to his Ishmaelite nose. The story! Ah, pardon! 'Twas high Christmas tide And just beef and beans; yet the land, far and wide, Was alive with such turkeys of silver and gold, As never men born to the north may behold. And Apaches? Aye, Apaches, and they took this game In a pen, tolled it in. Might not we do the same? So two of us started, strewing corn, Indian corn, Tow'rd a great granite gorge with the first flush of morn; Started gay, laughing back from the broad mesa's breast, At the bravest of men, who but warned for the best. We built a great pen from the sweet cedar wood Tumbled down from a crown where the sentry stars stood. Scarce done, when the turkeys in line—such a sight! Picking corn from the sand, russet gold, silver white, And so fat that they scarcely could waddle or hobble. And 'twas “Queek, tukee, queek,” and 'twas, “gobble and gobble!” And their great, full crops they did wabble and wabble As their bright, high heads they did bob, bow and bobble, Down, up, through the trench, crowding up in the pen. Now, quick, block the trench! Then the mules and the men! Springing forth from our cove, guns leaned to a rock, How we laughed! What a feast! We had got the whole flock. How we worked till the trench was all blocked close and tight, For we hungered, and, too, the near coming of night, Then the thought of our welcome. The news? We could hear Already, we fancied, the great hearty cheer As we rushed into camp and exultingly told Of the mule loads of turkeys in silver and gold. Then we turned for our guns. Our guns? In their place Ten Apaches stood there, and five guns in each face. And we stood! we stood straight and stood strong, track solid to track. What, turn, try to fly and be shot in the back? No! We threw hats in the air. We should not need them more. And yelled! Yelled as never yelled man or Comanche before. We dared them, defied them, right there in their lair. Why, we leaned to their guns in our splendid despair. What! spared us for bravery, because we dared death? You know the tale? Tell it, and spare me my breath. No, sir. They killed us, killed us both, there and then, And then nailed our scalps to that turkey pen. USLAND It is a waste of ink and energy to write “United States of America” always. All our property is marked US. Then why not Usland? And why should we always say American? The Canadian, the Mexican, the Brazilian, and so on, are as entirely entitled to the name “American” as we. Why not say Usman, as Frenchman, German, and so on? And where lies Usland, Land of Us? Where Freedom lives, there Usland lies! Fling down that map and measure thus Or argent seas or sapphire skies: To north, the North Pole; south, as far As ever eagle cleaved his way; To east, the blazing morning star, And west! West to the Judgment Day! No borrowed lion, rampt in gold; No bleeding Erin, plaintive strains; No starving millions, mute and cold; No plundered India, prone in chains; No peaceful farmer, forced to fly Or draw his plowshare from the sod, And fighting, one to fifty, die For freedom, fireside, and God. Fear not, brave, patient, free-born Boers, Great Usland's heart is yours today. Aye, England's heart of hearts is yours, Whatever scheming men may say. Her scheming men have mines to sell, And we? Why, meat and corn and wheat. But, Boers, all brave hearts wish you well; For England's triumph means defeat. THAT USSIAN OF USLAND “I am an Ussian true,” he said; “Keep off the grass there, Mister Bull! For if you don't, I'll bang your head And bang your belly-full. “Now mark, my burly jingo-man, So prone to muss and fuss and cuss, I am an Ussian, spick and span, From out the land of Us!” The stout man smole a frosty smile— “An Ussian! Russian, Rusk, or Russ?” “No, no! an Ussian, every while; My land the land of Us.” “Aw! Usland, Outland? or, maybe, Some Venezuela I'd forgot. Hand out your map and let me see Where Usland is, and what.” The Yankman leaned and spread his map And shewed the land of Us and shewed, Then eyed and eyed that paunchy chap, And pulled his chin and chewed. “What do you want?” A face grew red, And red chop whiskers redder grew. “I want the earth,” the Ussian said, “And all Alaska too. “My stars swim up yon seas of blue; No Shind am I, Boer, Turk or Russ. I am an Ussian—Ussian true; My land the land of Us. “My triple North Star lights me on, My Southern Cross leads ever thus; My sun scarce sets till burst of dawn. Hands off the land of Us!” SAYS PLATO Says Plato, “Once in Greece the gods Plucked grapes, pressed wine, and reveled deep And drowsed below their popy-pods, And lay full length the hills asleep. Then, waking, one said, ‘Overmuch We toil: come, let us rise and touch Red clay, and shape it into man, That he may build as we shall plan!’ And so they shaped man, all complete, Self-procreative, satisfied; Two heads, four hands, four feet. “And then the gods slept, heedless, long; But waking suddenly one day, They heard their valley ring with song And saw man reveling as they. Enraged, they drew their swords and said, ‘Bow down! bend down!’—but man replied Defiant, fearless, everywhere His four fists shaking in the air. The gods descending cleft in twain Each man; then wiped their swords on grapes; And let confusion reign. “And such confusion! each half ran, Ran here, ran there; or weep or laugh Or what he would, each helpless man Ran hunting for his other half. And from that day, thenceforth the grapes Bore blood and flame, and restless shapes Of hewn-down, helpless halves of men, Ran searching ever; crazed, as when First hewn in twain, they grasped, let go, Then grasped again; but rarely found That lost half once loved so.” Now, right or wrong, or false or true, 'Tis Plato's tale of bitter sweet; But I know well and well know you The quest keeps on at fever heat. Let Love, then, wisely sit and wait! The world is round; sit by the gate, Like blind Belisarius: being blind, Love should not search; Love shall not find By searching. Brass is so like gold, How shall this blind Love know new brass From pure soft gold of old? WELCOME TO THE GREAT AMERICAN OCEAN Aloha! Wahwah! Quelle raison? Ship ahoy! What sails are these? What tuneful Orpheus, what Jason Courts Colchis and her Golden Fleece? For never since the oak-keeled Argo Such sweet chords, such kingly cargo. A letter from Rio says there are more fiddles than guns on some of the great battleships, and that music is more in evidence than munitions of war. Amen! Amen! And may they all be as melodious and happy as Orpheus and Argus, although it is said Orpheus went to hell later on, soon after Jason's quest for the yellow wool. Never since the mad Magellan Dared the Philippines and died, Did these boundless billows swell in Such surprised and saucy pride. Are they laughing, chaffing at you? Waiting but to bang and bat you? Doughty Vikings, dauntless Norsemen, White-maned stallions plunge and fret; Ride them, ride them, daring horsemen, Ride or perish in ........ the wet! Galleons, doubloons galore Paved of old this proud sea floor! Carabellos, caballeros! Where your boasted Totus Munda? Chile carne con tamales. ... And the bull-fight of a Sunday! That is all there is to say Of all your yesterdays, to-day. Heed my heroes, heed the story; Gone the argent galleon; Gone the gold and gone the glory, Gone the gaudy, haughty Don. His sword, his pride, sleep side by side, Nor reck, at all, yond ebb or tide. Ye who buckle on bright armor, Read and heed nor boast at all Till ye have worn it warm and warmer, Fronting pride that runs to fall. And heed, my heroes, where away We all, a span of years today? But welcome, walls of flame and thunder, Isles of steel and miles of launches! Welcome to these seas of wonder, Men of war with olive branches; Welcome to dear Crusoe's seas, These sundown seas, this sun-born breeze. Welcome to the oldest, newest! Here God's spirit moved upon The waters, these the broadest, bluest, Ere that sudden burst of dawn Dividing day from primal night, When He said, “Let there be light.” But, beware the wild tornadoes! Entre nous, they are terrific! Scout that dago's gay bravados! Cut that silly name, Pacific! Balboa, wading to his knees, Cried: “Lo, the calm, pacific seas!” Straightway Cortez hewed his head off! Nay, blame not, accuse nor cavil. Spite of all that has been said of He should have hewed it to the navel; Aye, cut his neck off to his knees, For naming these “Pacific Seas!” Pacific? No, American! Her go, her get there, gown or gun! Her British, “Get, and keep who can,” All places, races, rolled in one. Pacific Ocean? Mild of motion? Never such a silly notion! So, beware the sometimes tidal Wave Tahitian, where bananas Bathe; where fig-leafed parties bridal Dine in tree-tops on mananas! Samoa's typhoons, too, beware— Her mermaids combing kinky hair. Aye, tidals, typhoons, 'clones beware! But when you touch sea-set Nippon, Where lift three thousand isles mid-air, And each an Eden dear as dawn, With dimpled Eves and dainty elves— Why, then beware your bloomin' selves. TWO WISE OLD MEN OF OMAR'S LAND The world lay as a dream of love, Lay drowned in beauty , drowsed in peace, Lay filled with plenty, fat-increase, Lay low- voiced as a wooing dove. And yet, poor, blind man was not glad, But to and fro, contentious, mad, Rebellious, restless, hard he sought And sought and sought—he scarce knew what. The Persian monarch shook his head, Slow twirled his twisted, raven beard, As one who doubted, questioned, feared. Then called his poet up and said: “What aileth man, blind man, that he, Stiff-necked and selfish, will not see Yon gorgeous glories overhead, These flowers climbing to the knee, As climb sweet babes that loving cling To hear a song?—Go forth and sing!” The poet passed. He sang all day, Sang all the year, sang many years; He sang in joy, he sang in tears, By desert way or watered way, Yet all his singing was in vain. Man would not list, man would not heed Save but for lust and selfish greed And selfish glory and hard gain. And so at last the poet sang In biting hunger and hard pain No more, but tattered, bent and gray, He hanged his harp and let it hang Where keen winds walked with wintry rain, High on a willow by the way, The while he sought his king to cry His failure forth and reason why. The old king pulled his thin white beard, Slow sipped his sherbet nervously, Peered right and left, suspicious peered, Thrummed with a foot as one who feared, Then fixed his crown on close; then he Clutched tight the wide arm of his throne, And sat all sullen, sad and lone. At last he savagely caught up And drained, deep drained, his jeweled cup; Then fierce he bade his poet say, And briefly say, what of the day? The trembling poet felt his head, He felt his thin neck chokingly. “Oh, king, this world is good to see! Oh, king, this world is beautiful!” The king's thin beard was white as wool, The while he plucked it terribly, Then suddenly and savage said: “Cut that! cut that! or lose your head!” The poet's knees smote knee to knee, The poet's face was pitiful. “Have mercy, king! hear me, hear me! This gorgeous world is beautiful, This beauteous world is good to see; But man, poor man, he has not time To see one thing at all, save one—” “Haste, haste, dull poet, and have done With all such feeble, foolish rime! No time? Bah! man, no bit of time To see but one thing? Well, that one?” “That one, oh, king, that one fair thing Of all fair things on earth to see, Oh, king, oh, wise and mighty king, That takes man's time continually, That takes man's time and drinks it up As you have drained your jeweled cup— Is woman, woman, wilful, fair— Just woman, woman, everywhere!” The king scarce knew what next to do; He did not like that ugly truth; For, far back in his sunny youth, He, too, had loved a goodly few. He punched a button, punched it twice, Then as he wiped his beard he said: “Oh, threadbare bard of foolish rime, If man looks all his time at her, Sees naught but her, pray tell me, sir, Why, how does woman spend her time?” The singer is a simple bird, The simplest ever seen or heard. It will not lie, it knows no thing Save but to sing and truly sing. The poet reached his neck, his head, As if to lay it on the shelf And quit the hard and hapless trade Of simple truth and homely rime That brought him neither peace nor pelf; Then with his last, faint gasp he said: “Why, woman, woman, matron, maid, She puts in all her precious time In looking, looking at herself!” A silence then was heard to fall So hard it broke into a grin! The old king thought a space and thought Of when her face was all in all— When love was scarce a wasteful sin, And even kingdoms were as naught. At last he laughed, and in a trice He banged the button, banged it thrice, Then clutched his poet's hand and then These two white-bearded, wise old men They sat that throne and chinned and chinned, And grinned, they did, and grinned and grinned!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Volume Five Songs of the American Seas A SONG OF CREATION The bravest, manliest man is he Who braves the brede, who breaks the sod, Who sows a seed, who plants a tree, Who turns and tears the barren clod, In partnership with God is he— Himself a very part of God, Aye, God's annointed, God's high priest. And he who sees, who knows to see As saw the eager seers of old, Is of the “wise men of the East,” Is richer than all Araby In incense, myrrh and gifts of gold. The noblest woman, bravest, best Of all brave souls beneath the sun? I say the queenliest is that one— Seek north or south or east or west— Who loves to fold the little frock And hear the cradle rock and rock. I say the purest woman, best Beneath our forty stars, is she Who loves her spouse most ardently And rocks the cradle oftenest— Who rocks and sings and rocks, and then, When birds are nesting, rocks again. BOOK FIRST CANTO I I A yucca crowned in creamy bloom, A yucca freighted with perfume, Breathed fragrance up the blossomed steep; The warm sea winds lay half asleep, Lay drowsing in the dreamy wold By Saint Francisco's tawny Bay, As if to fold, forever fold, Worn, wearied wings and rest alway In careless, languid Arcady. II Some clean, lean Eucalyptus trees, Wind-torn and tossing to the blue, Kept ward above the silent two Who sat the fragrant sundown seas Above the sounding Golden Gate Nor questioned overmuch of fate; For she was dowered, gold on gold, With wealth of face and form untold! And he was proud and passionate. III Ten thousand miles of mobile sea— This sea of all seas blent as one Wide, unbound book of mystery, Of awe, of sibyl prophecy, Ere yet a ghost or misty ken Of God's far, first Beginning when Vast darkness lay upon the deep; As when God's spirit moved upon Such waters cradled in such sleep Such night as never yet knew dawn, Such night as weird atallaph weaves But never mortal man conceives. IV He looked to heaven, God; but she Saw only his face and the sea. He said—his fond face leaned to hers, The warmest of God's worshipers— “In the beginning? Where and when, Before the fashioning of men, Swung first His high lamps to and fro, To light us as we please to go? And where the waters, dark deeps when God spake, and said, ‘Let there be light’? They still house where they housed, as then, Dark curtained with majestic night— Dusk Silence, in travail of Light That knew not man or man's, at all— Steel battle-ship or wood-built wall. V “Aye, these, these were the waters when God spake and knew His fair first-born— That silent, new-born baby morn, Such eons ere the noise of men. His Southern Cross, high-built about The deep, set in a town of stars, Commemorates, forbids a doubt That here first fell God's golden bars— Red bars, with soft, white silver blent, Broad sown from sapphire firmament. VI “Behold what wave-lights leap and run Swift up the shale from out the sea Inwove with silver, gold and sun! Light lingers in the tawny mane Of wild oats waving lazily Far upon the climbing poppy plain; Far up yon steeps of dusk and dawn— Black night, white light, inwound as one. But when, when fell that far, first dawn With ways of gold to walk upon? VII “I know not when, but only know That darkness lay upon yon deep, Lay cradled, as a child asleep, And that God's spirit moved upon These waters ere the burst of dawn When first His high lamps to and fro Swung forth to guide which way to go. VIII “I only know that Silence keeps High court forever still hereon, That Silence lords alone these deeps, The silence of God's house, and keeps Inviolate yon water's face. As if still His abiding place, As ere that far, first burst of dawn Ere fretful man set sail upon. IX “The deeps,” he mused, “are still as when Dusk Silence kept her curtained bed Low moaning for the birth of dawn, When she should push black night aside, As some ghoul nightmare most abhorred— When she might laughing look upon God's first-born glory, holy Light— As when fond Eve exulting cried, In mother-pain, with mother-pride, ‘Behold the fair first-born of men! I gat a man-child of the Lord!’” X As one discerning some sweet nook Of wild oats, mantling yellow, pink, Will pass, then turn and turn to look, Then pass again to think and think, Then try to not turn back again, But try and try to quite forget And, sighing, try and try in vain; So you would turn and turn again To her, her girlish woman's grace— Full-flowered yet fond baby's face. XI Her wide, sweet mouth, an opened rose, Pushed out, reached out, as if to kiss; A mobile mouth in proud repose This moment, then unlike to this As storm to calm, as day to night, As sullen darkness to swift light; This new-made woman was, the sun And surged sea interwound in one. XII Her proud and ample lips pushed out As kissing sea-winds unaware; And then they arched in angry pout, As if she cared yet did not care. Then lightning lit her great, wide eyes, As if black thunder walled the skies, And all things took some touch of her, The while she stood nor deigned to stir: The while she saw with vision dim— Saw all things, yet saw only him. XIII Such eyes as compass all the skies, That see all things yet naught have seen; Such eyes of love or sorrow's eyes— A martyr or a Magdalene? How sad that all great souls are sad! How sad that gladness is not glad— That Love's sad sister is sweet Pain, That only lips of beauty drain Life's full-brimmed, glittering goblet dry, And only drain the cup to die! XIV The yellow of her poppy hair Was as red gold is, when at rest; But when aroused was as the west In sunset flame and then—take care! Her tall, free-fashioned, supple form Was now some sudden, tropic storm, Was now some lily leaned at play. What sea and sun, sunshine and shower, Full flowered ere the noon of day, Full June ere yet the morn of May, This sun-born blossom of an hour— Precocious Californian flower! XV She answered not but looked away With brown hand arched above her brow,— As peers a boatman from his prow,— To where white sea-doves wheeled at play. She watched them long, then turned and sighed And looking in his face she cried, While blushing prettily, “Behold, There is no mateless dove, not one! And see! not one unhappy dove. Ten thousand circling in the sun, Entangled as the mesh of fate, Yet each remains as true as gold And constant courts his pretty mate. See here! See there! Behold, above— I think each dove would die for love.” He watched the shallows spume the shore And fleck the shelly, drifting shale, Then far at sea his swift eyes swept Where one tall, stately, snow-white sail Its silent course majestic kept And gloried in its alien mood, As his own soul in solitude. XVI “The shallows murmur and complain, The shallows turn with wind and tide, They fringe with froth and moil the main; They wail and will not be denied— Poor, puny babes, unsatisfied! XVII “The lighthouse clings her beetling steep Above the rock-sown, ragged shore Where Scylla and Charybdis roar And dangers lurk and shallows keep Mad tumult in the house of sleep. The shallows moan and moan alway— The deeps have not one word to say. XVIII “I reckon Silence as a grace That was ere light had name or place; A saint enshrined ere hand was laid To fashioning of man or maid. For, storm or calm, or sun or shade, Fair Silence never truth betrayed; For, ocean deep or dappled sky, Saint Silence never told a lie.” CANTO II I From out the surge of Sutro's steep, Beyond the Gate a rock uprears, So sudden, savage, unawares The very billows start and leap, As frightened at its lifted face, So shoreless, sealess, out of place: A sea-washed, surge-locked isle, as lone As lorn Napoleon on his throne— His Saint Helena throne, where still The dazed world in dumb wonder turns To his high throned, imperious will And incense burns and ever burns. Here huge sea-lions climb and cling, Despite the surge and sethe and shock, The topmost limit of the rock, And one is named Napoleon, king. Behold him lord the land, the sea, In lone, unquestioned majesty! II She saw, she raised alert her head With eager face and cheery said: “What lusty, upheaved, bull-built neck! What lungs to lift above the roar! What captain on his quarter-deck To mock the sea and scorn the shore! I like that scar across his breast, I like his ardent, lover's zest!” III The huge sea-beast uprose, uprose, As if to surely topple down; He reached his black and bearded nose Above his harem, gray, black, brown, Sleek, shining, wet or steaming dry, And mouthed and mouthed against the sky. IV What eloquence, what hot love pain! What land but this, what love but his? What isle of bliss but this and this— To roar and love and roar again? What land, what love but this his own, Loud thundered from his slippery throne; Loud thundered in his Sappho's ear, As if she could not, would not hear. V At last her heart was moved and she Raised two bright eyes to his black beard, Then sudden turned, as if she feared, And threw her headlong in the sea, Another Sappho, all for love. While Phaon towered still above— An instant only; yet once more That upheaved head, that great bull neck, That sea-born, bossed, bull-throated roar— A poise, a plunge, a flash, a fleck, And far down, caverned in the deep, Where sea-green curtains swing and sweep And varicolored carpets creep, Soft emerald or amethyst, Two lion lovers kept sweet tryst. VI She looked, looked long, then smiled, then sighed, A proud, pure soul unsatisfied, Then sat dense grasses suddenly And thrust a foot above the sea. She threw her backward, arms wide out, And up the poppy-spangled steep O'er grass-set cushions sown in gold, As she would sleep yet would not sleep. She reached her wide hands fast about And grasses, gold and manifold, Of lowly blossoms, pink and blue, She gathered in and laughing threw, With bare-armed, heedless, happy grace— Threw fragrant handfuls in his face. And then as if to sleep she lay, A babe nursed at the breast of May— Lay back with wide eyes to the skies And clouds of wondrous butterflies; Such Mariposa blooms in air! Such bloomy, golden, poppy hair! And which were hers or poppy's gold Without close care none could have told; And which were butterflies or bloom, To guess there was not guessing room, The while, in quest of sweets or rest, They fanned her face, they kissed her breast. VII That face like to a lilt of song— A face of sea-shell tint, with tide Of springtime flowing fast and strong And fearless in its maiden pride— Such rich rose ambushed in such hair Of heedless, wind-kissed, poppy gold, Blown here, blown there, blown anywhere, Soft-lifting, falling fold on fold, As made gold poppies where she lay Turn envious, turn green as May! What wise face yet what wilful face, A face that would not be denied No more than gipsy winds that race The sea bank in their saucy pride; A form that knew yet only knew The natural, the human, true. VIII Those two round mounds of Nineveh, What treasures of the past they knew! But these two round mounds here to-day Hold treasures richer far than they, And prophecies more truly true. Old Nineveh's twin mounds are dust; They only know the ghostly past; But these two new mounds hold in trust The awful future, hold the vast Unbounded empire, land or sea, Henceforth, for all eternity. Let pass dead pasts; far wiser turn And delve the future; love and learn. IX It seems she dreamed. She slept, we know, A happy, quiet little space, Then thrust a round limb far below And half-way turned aside her face, And then she threw her arms wide out In sleep, and so reached blind about, As if for something she might find From fortune-telling, gipsy wind. X The soft, warm winds from far away Were weary, and they crept so near They lay against her willing ear As if they had so much to say. And she, she seemed so glad to hear The while she loving, sleeping lay And dreamed of love nor dreamed of doubt, But laughing thrust her form far out And down the fragrant poppy steep In playful, restless, happy sleep. She sighed, she heaved her hilly breast, As one who would but could not rest. XI How natural, how free, how free, how fair, The while the happy winds on wing, As larger butterflies, laid bare A rippled, braided rim of white And outstretched ankles exquisite. What arms to hold a babe at breast— Such breast as prudist never guessed! What shapely limbs, what everything That makes great woman great and good— That makes for proud, pure motherhood! XII Such thews as mount the steeps of morn, Such limbs as love, not lust shall share, Such legs as God has shaped to bear The weight of ages, worlds unborn; Such limbs as Lesbian shrines revealed When comely, longing mothers kneeled; Such thews as Phidias loved to hew, Such limbs as Leighton loved to draw When painting tall, Greek girls at play; Such legs as blind old Homer saw, As Marlowe knew but yesterday, When Helen climbed in dreams for him Her cloud-topped towers of Ilium. CANTO III I White sea-gulls glistened in the sun— Ten thousand if a single one— And every sea-dove knew his mate. Far, far at sea, the Farallones Sent up a million plaintive moans From sea-beasts moaning love, or hate. The sun sank weary, flushed and worn, The warm sea-winds sank tattered, torn, The sun and sea lay welded, wed; The day lay crouched upon the deep Half closed, as eyes half closed in sleep, Half closed, as some good book half read. II The sea was an opal sea Inlaid with scintillating light, Yet close about and left and right The sea lay banked and bossed in night, As black as ever night may be. III The sundown sea all sudden then Lay argent, pallid, white as death. As when some great thing dies; as when A god gasps in one final breath And heaves full length his somber bed. The sundown sea now shone, mobile, Translucent, flaming, molten steel, Red, green, then tenfold more than red, And then of every hue, a hint Of doubloons spilling from the mint, Alternate, changing, manifold, Yet melting, minting all to gold. IV Far mountain peaks flashed flecks of gold And dashed with dappled flecks the skies. “Behold,” said he, “the fleecy fold Now slowly, surely, homeward hies. Such cobalt blue, such sheep of gold, Such gold as hath not place or name In elsewhere land, because no seer Hath seen or dauntless prophet told Where stood the loom in primal peace That wove the fair, first golden fleece. Behold, what gold-flecked flocks of Light! Ten million moving sheep of gold, Wee lambs of gold that nudge their dams, Great hornèd, wrinkled, heady rams! V “Slow-shepherded, the golden sheep, With bent horns lowered to the deep, Come home; the hollows of the sea Receive and house them lovingly. The little lambs of Light come home And house them in the argent foam, The while He counts them every one, And shuts the Gate, for day is done. VI “Aye, day is done, the dying sun Sinks wounded unto death to-night; A great, hurt swan, he sinks to rest, His wings all crimson, blood his breast! What wide, low wings, reached left and right He sings, and night and swan are one— One huge black swan of Helicon. VII “What crimson breast, what crimson wings The while he dies, and dying sings! Yet safe is housed the happy fold, The golden sheep, the fleece of gold That lured the dauntless Argonaut— The fleece that daring Jason sought.” VIII She waking sighed, soft murmuring, As waters from some wood-walled spring: “Oh happy, huge, horn-headed rams, To guide and lead the golden fleece, To ward the fold of fat increase Fast mated to your golden dams! What bridal gold, what golden bride, What golden twin lambs, side by side! Oh happy, happy nudging lambs, Thrice happy, happy golden dams!” IX His face was still against the west; For still a flush of gold was there That would not or that could not rest, But seemed some night bird of the air. At last, with half-averted head And dreamfully, as dreaming, said: “What banker gathers yonder gold That sinks, sea-washed, beyond the deeps? Lie there no sands to house and hold This sunset gold in countless heaps? There sure must be some far, fierce land, Some Guinea shore, some fire-fed strand, Some glowing, palm-set, pathless spot Where all this sunset gold is stored, As misers gather hoard on hoard. There sure must be, beyond this sea, Some Argo's gold, some argosy, Some golden fleece, long since forgot, To wait the coming Argonaut.” X She sprang up sudden, savagely, And flushed, and paled, looked far away, Grinding gold poppies with her heel. She could not say, she could but feel. She nothing said, because that they Who really feel can rarely say. And then she looked up, forth and far, And pointed to the pale North Star, The while her color went and came From pink to white, from frost to flame. XI For this, the one forbidden theme, The one hard, dread, unquiet dream That he should go, lead forth and far Below the triple Arctic star, As he had planned; and now to speak, To hint—she heard with pallid cheek. Hard had she tried, had fain forgot How strong, strange men were trending far Against this cold, elusive star, And he their Jason—Argonaut! CANTO IV I How passing fair, how wondrous fair This daughter of the yellow sun! Her sunlit length and strength of hair Seemed sun and gold inwound in one. How strangely silent, unaware, Unconscious quite of strength or grace Or peril of her beauteous face, She stood, the first-born of a race, A proud, new race, scarce yet begun. How tall she stood, free debonair— How stately and how supple, tall, The time she loosened and let fall Her tossed and mighty Titian hair! II So beautiful she was, as one From out some priceless picture-book! You could but love, you had no choice But love and turn again to look. How young she was and yet how old!— Red orange ripened in the sun Where never hand had reached as yet. The calm strength of her lifted face, The low notes of her tuneful voice, Were mint-marks of that wondrous race But scarcely born nor known as yet Beyond yon yellow hills that fret Warm sea-winds with their waving pine. A princess of that royal line Of kings who came and silent passed, Yet, passing, set bold, royal hand And mighty mint-marks on the land, And set it there to last and last, As if in bronzen copper cast. III He, too, was born of men who wooed The savage walks of solitude, And hewed close, clean to nature's laws— Of men who knew not tears or fears, Of men full-sexed, yet men who knew Not sex till perfect manhood was. When men had thews of antique men, And one stood with the strength of ten; When men gat men who dared to do; Gat men of heart who dwelt apart, As Adam dwelt, when giants grew And men as gods drew ample breath— As Adams with their thousand years, Ere drunkenness of sex had done The silly world to willing death. IV What royal parentage, what true Nobility, those men who knew The light, who chased the yellow sun From sea to sea triumphantly, And westward fought and westward won, As never daring man had done. V They housed with God upon the height; Companioned with the peak, the pine; They led the red-lit firing line. Walled 'round by room and room and room, They read God's open book at night, And drank His star-distilled perfume; By day they dared the trackless west And chased the battling sun to rest. VI Such sad, mad marches to the sea, Such silent sacrifice, such trust! Such months of marching, misery, Such mountains heaped with heroes' dust! Yet what stout thews the fearless few Who won the sea at last, who knew The cleansing fire and laid hold To hammer out their house of gold! VII Their cities zone their sea of seas, Their white tents top the mountain's crest. The coward? He trenched not with these, The weakling? He was laid to rest. Each man stood forth a man, such men As God wrought not since time began, Each man a hero, lion each. Behold what length of limb, what length Of life, of love, what daring reach To deep-hived honeycomb! What strength! How clean his hands, how stout his heart To dare, to do, camp, court or mart. He stands so tall, so clean, he hears The morning music of the spheres. VIII He loved her, feared her, far apart, He kept his ways and dreamed his dreams; He sang strange songs, he tuned his heart To music of the pines that preach Such sermons on such holy themes As only he who climbs can reach. IX He would not selfish pluck one rose To wear upon his breast a day And let its perfume pass away With any wind that comes or goes. Why, he might walk God's garden through Nor touch one bud nor fright one bird. The music of the spheres he heard, The harmony he breathed, he knew. He never marred God's harmony With one harsh thought. The favored few Who cared to live above the sod And lift glad faces up to God He knew loved all as well as he, Had equal right to rose or tree. X And he must spare all to the day Their willing feet should pass the way God in His garden walked at eve. And as for weaklings who by turn Would jest or jeer, he could but grieve, And pity all and silent say: “Let us lead forth, make fair the way; By time and stress they, too, will learn Which way to live, to love, to turn.” XI The long, lean Polar bear uprose, Outreached a paw, a bare, black nose, As if to still hold hard control, By glacier steep or ice-packed main, His mighty battlemented snows. He bared his yellow teeth in vain; Then backed against his bleak North Pole He sulked and shook his icy chain. And he who dared not pluck a rose, As if in chorus with his pine, Must up and lead the battle line Beyond the awesome Arctic chine. XII No airy sighs, no tales to tell; He knew God is, that all is well, That death is but a name, a date, A milestone by the stormy road, Where you may lay aside your load And bow your face and rest and wait, Defying fear, defying fate. XIII How fair is San Francisco Bay When golden stars consort and when The moon pours silver paths for men, And care walks by the other way! Huge ships, black-bellied, lay below Broad, yellow flags from silken Chind, Round, blood-red banners from Nippon, Like to her sun at sudden dawn— Brave battle-ships as white as snow, With bannered stars tossed to the wind, Warm as a kiss when love is kind. XIV 'Twas twilight, such soft, twilight night As only Californians know, When faithful love is forth, and when The Bay lies bathed in mellow light; And perfumed breath and softened breeze Blows far from Honolulu's seas— From sundown seas in afterglow— When Song sits at the feet of men And pipes, low-voiced as mated dove, For love to measure step with love. XV And yet, for all the perfumed seas, The peace, the silent harmonies, The two stood mute, estranged before Her high-built, stately, opened door High up the terraced, plunging hill As hushed as death, as white and still. XVI The moon, amid her yellow fleet, With full, white sail, moved on and on, And drew, as loving hearts are drawn, All seas of earth fast following, As slow she sailed her sapphire seas. Then, as if pausing, pitying, She poured down at their very feet Broad silver ways to walk upon Which way they would, or east or west, Which way they would, or worst or best. XVII Her voice was low, low leaned her head, Her two white hands all helpless prest As if to hush her aching breast, As if to bid her aching heart To silent bear its bitter part, The while she choking, sobbing, said: “Then here, for all our poppy days, Here, here, the parting of the ways?” XVIII “Aye, so you will it. Here divide The ways, forever and a day. You, you—you women lead the way— You lead where love hangs crucified, Where love is laid prone in the dust— Where cunning, cold men mouth sweet lies And make pure love their merchandise. You heedless lead to hollow lands Of bloodless hearts and nerveless hands; I will not rival such, nay, nay Not look on such, save with disgust.” XIX Her head sank lower still: her hair, Her heavy hair, great skeins of gold, Hung loosened, heedless, fold on fold, As if she cared not, could not care; She tried to speak but nothing said; She could but press her aching heart, Step back a pace and shudder, start, The while she slowly moved her head, As if to say; but nothing said. XX Her silence lit his soul with rage, He strode before her, forth and back, A lion strident in his cage, Hard bound within his iron track. And then he paused, shook back his head, And fronting her half savage said: “My father, yours, each Argonaut An Alexander, to this sea Came forth and conquered mightily. XXI “God, what great loves, what lovers when These westmost states were born of men, When giants gripped their hands and came With nerves of steel and souls of flame— Could you not wait within yon Gate, As their loves dared to wait and wait? An hundred thousand Didos sat Atlantic's sea-bank nor forgot, The while their lovers westmost fought, But patient sat as Dido, when She waved Æneas back again And bravely dared to smile thereat. XXII “Hear me! All Europe, rind to core, Is rotting, tumbling, base to top. Withhold the gold and silver prop Our dauntless fathers hewed of yore From yonder seamed Sierras' core, And such a toppling you may hear As never fell on mortal ear. XXIII “What's London town but sorrow's town And sins, such as I dare not name? Such thousands creeping up and down Its dreary streets in draggled shame! What's London but a market pen— Its hundred thousand lewd, rude men? What's London but a town of stone, Its thousand thousand women prone? XXIV “What's Paris but a painted screen, A gaudy gauze that scant conceals The sensuous nakedness between The folds it but the more reveals? What's Paris but a circus, fair, To tempt this west world's open purse With tawdry trinkets, toys bizarre? Ah, would that she were nothing worse! What's Paris but a piteous mart For west-world mothers crazed to trade Some silly, simpering, weak maid For thread-bare, out-at-elbows rank— To outworn, weak degenerate Whose bank is but the faro bank, Whose grave bounds all his real estate; Whose boast, whose only stock in trade, A duel and a ruined maid! XXV “What's Berlin, Dresden, sorry Rome, But traps that take you unaware? Behold yon paintings, right at home, Where nature paints with patient care Such splendid pictures, sea and shore, As all the world should bow before; Such pictures hanging to the skies Against the walls of Paradise, From base to bastion, as should wake Piave's painter from the dust; Such walls of color crowned in snow, Such steeps, such deeps, profoundly vast, As old-time Art had died to know, And knowing, died content, as he Who looked from Nimo's steep to see, Just once, the Promised Land, and passed! And yet, for all yon scene, this sea, You will not bide, Penelope?” XXVI “Then go, since you so will it, go! My way lies yonder, forth and far Beneath yon gleaming northmost star O'er silent lands of trackless snow. Lo, there leads duty, hope, as when This westmost world demanded men: Such men as led the firing line When blood ran free as festal wine; Such men as when, fast side by side, Our fathers fought and fighting died.” XXVII “But go—good by! Go see again The noisy circus, since you must; Its painted women that disgust, Its nauseating monkey men; But mark you, Beautiful, the moth That loves that luring, sensuous light— Nay, hear! I am not wilful, wroth; I love with such exceeding might, My beautiful, my all, my life, I would not, could not take to wife My lily tainted by the touch The breath, the very sight of such. XXVIII “Shall I see leprous apes lean o'er My rose, breathe, touch it if they may, With breath that is a very stench, The while they bow and bend before, Familiar, as with some weak wench, And smirk in double-meaning French? XXIX “You shrink back angered? Well, adieu; What, not a hand? What, not a touch? My crime is that I love too much, My crime is that I love too true, Love you, love you, not part of you— Yea, how much less the rose that droops In fevered halls where folly stoops! XXX “Yon splendid, triple, midnight star Is mine; I follow fast and sure, Because it guides so far, so far From fevered follies that allure Your soul, your splendid, spotless soul To wreck where siren billows roll— Good night! What, turn aside your face That I might never see again Its lifted glory and proud grace, As some brave beacon light! Well, then, . . . Ha, ha! Let's laugh lest one may weep— How steep your hill seems, steeps how steep! How deep down seems the misty town, How lone, how dark, how distant down! The moon, too, turns her face, her light, As you have turned your face tonight, As you have turned your face from me, My heartless, lost Penelope.” XXXI Then sudden up she tossed her head, And, face to his face, proudly said: “Penelope! To wait and weave! Penelope! To wait and wait, As waits a dog within his gate; To weave and unweave, grieve and grieve, As some weak harem favorite Tight fenced from action, life, and light! XXXII “Why, I should not have sat one day To that dull-threaded, thudding loom, With cowards crowding fast for room To say what brave men dare not say! Why, I had snatched down from the wall His second sword that sad, first day And set its edge to end it all!— Had hewn that loom to splinters, yea, Had slashed the warp, enmeshed the woof And called that dog and put to proof Each silly suitor hounding me, Then hoisted sail and bent to sea! XXXIII “Penelope! Penelope! Of all fool tales in history I think this tale the foolishest! Why I, the favored of that land, Had such fools come to seek my hand, Had ranged in line the sexless list And frankly answered with my fist!” XXXIV He passed. She paused. Each helpless hand Fell down, fell heavy down as lead; She tried but could not understand. At last she raised once more her head, Set firm her lips, stepped back a pace, Looked long his far star in the face, Stood stately, still, as fixed as fate, Till all the east flushed sudden red; Then as she turned within she said: “I cannot, will not, will not wait.” He passed, with set lips, lifted hand, He passed the northmost golden zone Of dreamful, yellow poppy land, And silent passed, and so alone! Beyond the utmost Oregon, Far, far beyond and still beyond, Where the crisp, clean waters rattle O'er the sparkling, shining shale, Where the dusky king, Seattle, Lorded mountain, wold and vale, When he drave his galleon Where scarce a battle-ship would dare, Far out, far out, or dusk or dawn, An hundred leagues of sea to fare All up or down or anywhere— Whose dusky, tall, breeched oarsmen ate Red salmon of an hundred weight. His huge white cedar ships were wrought By flint and flame and ballasted With slabs of virgin copper brought From hidden mountain mines and red With dash and dot of native gold— Their coin, their currency of old. Here white Tacoma smiles upon Wild, wood-born blackness everywhere! Here hairy monsters prowl and howl Their whole night long and nothing care, White-fanged or mated cheek by jowl. Here nature is, here man may trace First footprints of his brutal race. On, on, what wood-hung waters these; What baby cities crowd the seas! What British ships incessantly Cross swords with stately shadow trees! What white-maned stallions plunge and play And charge and challenge day by day These baby cities of the wold That sit their shifting sands of gold! What black firs climb the cloud-capped steep And bid the bold invaders halt! What robust Britons mount and keep Their topless walls of Esquimalt! On, on, what inland seas of wonder, So icy cold, so spicy keen, So deep as fate, so clear, so clean! You taste a tingling, spicy breath What time the avalanche's thunder Grinds balm and balsam woods to death And in these wood-walled seas of wonder Swift drowns his dread, earth-shaking thunder; While here and there, beneath the trees White ice tents dash and dot the seas. BOOK SECOND CANTO I I His triple star led on and on, Led up blue, bastioned Chilkoot Pass To clouds, through clouds, above white clouds That droop with snows like beaded strouds— Above a world of gleaming glass, Where loomed such cities of the skies As only prophets look upon, As only loving poets see, With prophet ken of mystery. II What lone, white silence, left or right, What whiteness, something more than white! Such steel blue whiteness, van or rear— Such silence as you could but hear Above the sparkled, frosted rime, As if the steely stars kept time And sang their mystic, mighty rune— . . . And oh, the icy, eerie moon! III What temples, towers, tombs of white, White tombs, white tombstones, left and right, That pushed the passing night aside To ward where fallen stars had died— To ward white tombs where dead stars lay— White tombs more white, more bright than they; White tombs high heaped white tombs upon— White Ossa piled on Pelion! IV Pale, steel stars flashed, rose, fell again, Then paused, leaned low, as pitying, And leaning so they ceased to sing, The while the moon, with mother care, Slow rocked her silver rocking-chair. V Night here, mid-year, is as a span; Thor comes, a gold-clad king of war, Comes only as the great Thor can. Thor storms the battlements and Thor, Far leaping, clinging crowned upon, Throws battle hammer forth and back Until the walls blaze in his track With sparks and it is sudden dawn— Dawn, sudden, sparkling, as a gem— A jeweled, frost-set diadem Of diamond, ruby, radium. VI Two tallest, ice-tipt peaks take flame, Take yellow flame, take crimson, pink, Then, ere you yet have time to think, Take hues that never yet had name. Then turret, minaret, and tower, As if to mark some mystic hour, Or ancient, lost Masonic sign, Take on a darkness like to night, Deep night below the yellow light That erstwhile seemed some snow-white tomb. Then all is set in ghostly gloom, As some dim-lighted, storied shrine— As if the stars forget to stay At court when comes the kingly day. VII And now the high-built shafts of brass, Gate posts that guard the tomb-set pass, Put off their crowns, rich robes, and all Their sudden, splendid light let fall; And tomb and minaret and tower Again gleam as that midnight hour. While day, as scorning still to wait, Drives fiercely through the ice-built gate That guards the Arctic's outer hem Of white, high-built Jerusalem. VIII To see, to guess the great white throne, Behold Alaska's ice-built steeps Where everlasting silence keeps And white death lives and lords alone: Go see God's river born full grown— The gold of this stream it is good: Here grows the Ark's white gopher wood— A wide, white land, unnamed, unknown, A land of mystery and moan. IX Tall, trim, slim gopher trees incline, A leaning, laden, helpless copse, And moan and creak and intertwine Their laden, twisted, tossing tops, And moan all night and moan all day With winds that walk these steeps alway. X The melancholy moose looks down, A tattered Capuchin in brown, A gaunt, ungainly, mateless monk, An elephant without his trunk, While far, against the gleaming blue, High up a rock-topt ridge of snow, Where scarce a dream would care to go, Climb countless blue-clad caribou, In endless line till lost to view. XI The rent ice surges, grinds and groans, Then gorges, backs, and climbs the shore, Then breaks with sudden rage and roar And plunging, leaping, foams and moans Swift down the surging, seething stream— Mad hurdles of some monstrous dream. XII To see God's river born full grown, To see him burst the womb of earth And leap, a giant at his birth, Through shoreless whiteness, with wild shout— A shout so sharp, so cold, so dread You see, feel, hear, his sheeted dead— 'Tis as to know, no longer doubt, 'Tis as to know the eld Unknown, Aye, bow before the great white throne. XIII White-hooded nuns, steeps gleaming white, Lean o'er his cradle, left and right, And weep the while he moans and cries And rends the earth with agonies; High ice-heaved summits where no thing Has yet set foot or flashed a wing— Bare ice-built summits where the white Wide world is but a sea of white— White kneeling nuns that kneel and feed The groaning ice god in his greed, And feed, forever feed, man's soul. The full-grown river bounds right on From out his birthplace tow'rd the Pole; He knows no limit, no control: He scarce is here till he is gone— This sudden, mad, ice-born Yukon. XIV Beyond white plunging Chilkoot Pass, That trackless Pass of stately tombs, Of midday glories, midnight glooms, Of morn's great gate posts, girt in brass— This courtier, born to nature's court, This comrade, peer of peaks, still kept Companion with the stars and leapt And laughed, the gliding sea of glass Beneath his feet in merry sport. XV Then mute red men, the quick canoe, Then o'er the ice-born surge and on, Till gleaming snows and steeps were gone, Till wide, deep waters, swirling, blue, Received the sudden, swift canoe, That leapt and laughed and laughing flew. XVI Then tall, lean trees, girth scarce a span, With moss-set, moss-hung banks of gold Most rich in hue, more gorgeous than Silk carpetings of Turkestan: Deep yellow mosses, rich as gold, More gorgeous than the eye of man Hath seen save in this wonderland— Then flashing, tumbling, headlong waves Below white, ice-bound, ice-built shores— The river swept a stream of white Where basalt bluffs made day like night. And then they heard no sound, the oars Were idle, still as grassy graves. XVII And then the mad, tumultuous moon Spilt silver seas to plunge upon, Possessed the land, a sea of white. That white moon rivaled the red dawn And slew the very name of night, And walked the grave of afternoon— That vast, vehement, stark and moon! XVIII The wide, still waters, sedgy shore, A lank, brown wolf, a hungry howl, A lean and hungry midday moon; And then again the red man's oar— A wide-winged, mute, white Arctic owl, A black, red-crested, screeching loon That knew not night from middle noon, Nor gold-robed sun from lean, lank moon— That crazy, black, red-crested loon. XIX Swift narrows now, and now and then A broken boat with drowning men; The wide, still marshes, dank as death, Where honked the wild goose long and loud With unabated, angry breath. Black swallows twittered in a cloud Above the broad mosquito marsh, The wild goose honked, forlorn and harsh; Honked, fluttered, flew in warlike mood Above her startled, myriad brood, The while the melancholy moose, As if to mock the honking goose, Forsook his wall, plunged in the wave And sank, as sinking in a grave, Sank to his eyes, his great, sad eyes, And watched, in wonder, mute surprise, Watched broken barge and drowning men Drift, swirl, then plunge the gorge again. XX Again that great white Arctic owl, As pitying, it perched the bank Where swirled a barge and swirling sank— A drowned man swirling with white face Low lifting from the swift whirlpool. That distant, doleful, hilltop howl— That screaming, crimson-crested fool! And oh, that eerie, ice-made moon That hung the cobalt tent of blue And looked straight down, to look you through, That dead man swirling in his place, That honking, honking, huge gray goose, That solitary, sad-eyed moose, That owl, that wolf, that human loon, And oh, that death's head, hideous moon! XXI And this the Yukon, night by night, The yellow Yukon, day by day; A land of death, vast, voiceless, white, A graveyard locked in ice-set clay, A graveyard to the Judgment Day. XXII On, on, the swirling pool was gone, On, on, the boat swept on, swept on, That moon was as a thousand moons! Two dead men swirled, one swept, one sank— Two wolves, two owls, two yelling loons! And now three loons! How many moons? How many white owls perch the shore? Three lank, black wolves along the bank That watch the drowned men swirl or sink! Three screeching loons along the brink— That moon disputing with the dawn That dared the yellow, dread Yukon! XXIII And why so like some lorn graveyard Where only owls and loons may say And life goes by the other way? Aye, why so hideous and so hard, So deathly hard to look upon? Because this cold, wild, dread Yukon, Of gold-sown banks, of sea white waves, Is but one land, one sea of graves. XXIV Behold where bones hang either bank! Great tusks of beasts before the flood That floated here and floating sank— 'Mid ice-locked walls and ice-hung steep, With muck and stone and moss and mud, Where only death and darkness keep! Lo, this is death-land! Heap on heap, By ice-strown strand or rock-built steep, By moss-brown walls, gray, green or blue, The Yukon cleaves a graveyard through! Three thousand miles of tusk anad bone, Strown here, strown there, all heedless strown, All strown and sown just as they lay That time the fearful deluge passed, Safe locked in ices to the last, Safe locked, as records laid away, To wait, to wait, the Judgment Day. XXV He landed, pierced the ice-locked earth, He burned it to the very bone— Burned and laid bare the deep bedstone Placed at the building, at the birth Of morn, and here, there, everywhere, Such bones of bison, mastodon! Such tusky monsters without name! Great ice-bound bones with flesh scarce gone, So fresh the wild dogs nightly came To fight about and feast upon. And gold along the bedrock lay So bounteous below the bones Men barely need to turn the stones To fill their skins, within the day, With rich, red gold and go their way. XXVI “The gold of that place it is good.” Lo, here God laid the Paradise! Lo, here each witness of the flood, Tight jailed in ice eternal, lies To wait the bailiff's chorus call: “Come into court, come one, come all!” But why so cold, so deathly cold The battered beasts, the scattered gold, The pleasant trees of Paradise, Deep locked in everlasting ice? XXVII Oyez! the red man's simple tale; He says that once, o'er hill and vale, Ripe fruits hung ready all the year; That man knew neither frost nor fear, That bison wallowed to the eyes In grass, that palm trees brushed the skies Where birds made music all day long. That then a great chief shaped a spear Bone-tipt and sharp and long and strong, And made a deadly moon-shaped bow, And then a flint-tipt arrow wrought. Then cunning, snake-like, creeping low, As creeps a cruel cat, he sought And in sheer wantonness he shot A large-eyed, trusting, silly roe. And then, exultant, crazed, he slew Ten bison, ten tame bear and, too, A harmless, long-limbed, shambling moose; That then the smell of blood let loose The passions of all men and all Uprose and slew, or great or small— Uprose and slew till hot midday All four-foot creatures in their way; Then proud, defiant, every one, Shook his red spear-point at the sun. XXVIII Then God said, through a mist of tears, “What would ye, braves made mad with blood?” And then they shook their bone-tipt spears And cried, “The sun it is not good! Too hot the sun, too long the day; Break off and throw the end away!” XXIX Then God, most angered instantly, Drew down the day from out the sky And brake the day across his knee And hurled the fragments hot and high And far down till they fell upon The bronzing waves of dread Yukon, Nor spared the red men one dim ray Of light to lead them on their way. XXX And then the red men filled the lands With wailing for just one faint ray Of light to guide them home that they Might wash and cleanse their blood-red hands. XXXI But God said, “Yonder, far away Down yon Yukon, your broken day! Go gather it from out the night! That fitful, fearful Northern Light, Is all that ye shall ever know To guide henceforth the way you go. XXXII “You shall not see my face again, But you shall see cold death instead. This land hath sinned, this land is dead; You drenched your beauteous land in blood, And now behold the wild, white rain Shall fall until a drowning flood Shall fill all things above, below, To wash away the smell of blood, And birds shall die and beasts be dumb, When cold, the cold of death shall come And weave a piteous shroud of snow, In graveyard silence, ever so.” XXXIII The red men say that then the rain Drowned all the fires of the world, Then drowned the fires of the moon; That then the sun came not again, Save in the middle summer noon, When hot, red lances they had hurled Are hurled at them like fiery rain, Till Yukon rages like a main. XXXIV With bated breath these skin-clad men Tell why the big-nosed moose foreknew The flood; how, bandy-legged, he flew Far up high Saint Elias: how Down in the slope of his left horn, The raven rested, night and morn; How, in the hollow of his right, The dove-hued moose-bird nestled low Until they touched the utmost height; How dove and raven soon took flight And winged them forth and far away; But how the moose did stay and stay, His great sad eyes all wet with tears, And keep his steeps two thousand years. XXXV He heard the half nude red men say, Close huddled to the flame at night, How in the hollow of a palm A woman and a water rat, That dreadful, darkened, drowning day, Crept close and nestled in their fright; And how a bear, tame as a lamb, Came to them in the tree and sat The long, long drift-time to the sea, The while the wooing water rat Made love to her incessantly; How then the bear became a priest And married them at last; how then To them was born the shortest, least Of all the children of all men, And yet most cunning and most brave Of all who dare the bleak north wave. XXXVI What tales of tropic fruit! No tale But of some soft, sweet, sensuous clime, Of love and lovely maiden's trust— Some peopled, pleasant, palm-hung vale Of everlasting summer time— And, then the deadly sin of lust; Forbidden fruit, shame and disgust! XXXVII And whence the story of it all, The palm land, love land and the fall? Was't born of ages of desire From such sad children of the snows For something fairer, better, higher? God knows, God knows, God only knows. But I should say, hand laid to heart And head made bare, as I would swear, These piteous, sad-faced children there Knew Eden, the expulsion, knew The deluge, knew the deluge true! XXXVIII And what though this be surely so? Just this: I know, as all men know, As few before this surely knew— Just this, and count it great or small, The best of you or worst of you, The Bible, lid to lid, is true! CANTO II I The year waxed weary, gouty, old; The crisp days dwindled to a span, The dying year it fell as cold As dead feet of a dying man. The hard, long, weary work was done, The dark, deep pits probed to the bone, And each had just one tale to tell. Ten thousand argonauts as one, Agnostic, Christian, infidel, All said, despite of creed or class, All said as one, “As surely as The Bible is, the deluge was, Whate'er the curse, whate'er the cause!” II What merry men these miners were, And mighty in their pent-up force! They wrought for her, they fought for her, For her alone, or night or day, In tent or camp, their one discourse The Love three thousand miles away, The Love who waked to watch and pray. III Yet rude were they and brutal they, Their love a blended love and lust, Born of this later, loveless day; You could but love them for their truth, Their frankness and their fiery youth, And yet turn from them in disgust, To loathe, to pity, and mistrust. IV The Siege of Troy knew scarce such men, Such hardy, daring men as they, The coward had not voyaged then, The weak had died upon the way. V They sang, they sang some like to this, “I say risk all for one warm kiss; I say 'twere better risk the fall, Like Romeo, to venture all And boldly climb to deadly bliss.” VI I like that savage, Sabine way; What mighty minstrels came of it! Their songs are ringing to this day, The bravest ever sung or writ; Their loves the love of Juliet, Of Portia, Desdemona, yea, The old true loves are living yet; And we, we love, we weep, we sigh, In love with loves that will not die. VII Then take her, lover, sword in hand, Hot-blooded and red-handed, clasp Her sudden, stormy, tall and grand, And lift her in your iron grasp And kiss her, kiss her till she cries From keen, sweet, happy, killing pain. Aye, kiss her till she seeming dies; Aye, kiss her till she dies, and then, Why kiss her back to life again! VIII I love all things that truly love, I love the low-voiced cooing dove In wooing time, he woos so true, His soft notes fall so overfull Of love they thrill me through and through. But when the thunder-throated bull Upheaves his head and shakes the air With eloquence and battle's blare, And roars and tears the earth to woo, I like his warlike wooing too. IX Yet best to love that lover is Who loves all things beneath the sun, Then finds all fair things in just one, And finds all fortune in one kiss. X How wisely born, how more than wise, How wisely learned must be that soul Who loves all earth, all Paradise, All people, places, pole to pole, Yet in one kiss includes the whole! XI Give me a lover ever bold, A lover clean, keen, sword in hand, Like to those white-plumed knights of old Whose loves held honor in the land; Those men with hot blood in their veins And hot, swift, iron hand to kill— Those women loving well the chains That bound them fast against their will; Yet loved and lived—are living still. XII Enough: the bronzed man launched his boat, A faithful dwarf clutched at the oar, And Boreas began to roar As if to break his burly throat. XIII Down, down by basalt palisade, Down, down by bleakest ice-piled isle! The mute, dwarf water rat afraid? The water rat it could but smile To hear the cold, wild waters roar Against his savage Arctic shore. XIV But now he listened, gave a shout, A startled cry, akin to fear. The hand of God had reached swift out And locked, as in an iron vise, The whole white world in blue-black ice, And daylight scarce seemed living more. The day, the year, the world, lay dead. With star-tipt candles foot and head; Great stars, that burn a whole half year, Stood forth, five-horned, and near, so near! XV The ghost-white day scarce drew a breath, The dying day shrank to a span; There was no life save that of man And woolly dogs—man, dogs, and death! The sun, a mass of molten gold, Surged feebly up, then sudden rolled Right back as in a beaten track And left the white world to the moon And five-horned stars of gleaming gold; Such stars as sang in silent rune— And oh, the cold, such killing cold As few have felt and none have told! XVI And now he knew the last dim light Lay on yon ice-shaft, steep and far, Where stood one bold, triumphant star, And he would dare the gleaming height, Would see the death-bed of the day, Whatever fate might make of it. A foolish thing, yet were it fit That he who dared to love, to say, To live, should look the last of Light Full in the face, then go his way All silent into lasting night As he had left her, on her height? XVII He climbed, he climbed, he neared at last The Golden Fleece of flitting Light! When sudden as an eagle's flight— An eagle frightened from its nest That crowns the topmost, rock-reared crest— It swooped, it drooped, it, dying, passed. XVIII As when some sunny, poppy day The Mariposa scatters gold The while he takes his happy flight, Like star dust when the day is old, So passed his Light and all was night. XIX Some star-like scattered flecks of gold Flashed from the far and fading wings That kept the sky, like living things— Then oh, the cold, the cruel cold! The light, the life of him had past, The spirit of the day had fled; The lover of God's first-born, Light, Descended, mourning for his dead. The last of light, the very last He deemed that he should look upon Until God's everlasting dawn Beyond this dread half year of night Had fled forever from his sight. XX 'Twas death to go, thrice death to stay. Turn back, go southward, seek the sun? Yea, better die in search of light, Die boldly, face set forth for day, As many dauntless men have done, Than wail at fate and house with night. XXI Some wolly dogs, a low, dwarf-chief— His trained thews stood him now in stead— Broad snow-shoes, skins, a laden sled.— That moon was as a brazen thief That dares to mock, laugh, and carouse! It followed, followed everywhere; He hid his face, that moon was there. Such painful light, such piteous pain! It broke into his very brain, As breaks a burglar in a house. XXII Scarce seen, a change came, slow, so slow! That moon sank slowly out of sight, The lower world of gleaming white Took on a somber band of woe, A wall of umber 'round about, So dim at first you could but doubt, That change there was, day after day— Nay, nay, not day, I can but say Sleep after sleep, sleep after sleep— That band grew darker, deep, more deep, Until there girt a dense dark wall, A low, black wall of ebon hue, Oppressive, deathlike as a pall; It walked with you, close compassed you, While not one thread of light shot through. Above the black a gird of brown Soft blending into amber hue, And then from out the cobalt blue Great, massive, golden stars swung down Like tow'rd lights of mountain town. XXIII At last the moon moved gaunt and slow, Half veiled her hollow, hungry face In amber, kept unsteady pace High up her star-set wall of snow, Nor scarcely deigned to look below. XXIV Then far beyond, above the night, Above the umber, amber hue, Above the lean moon's blare and blight, One mighty ice shaft shimmered through; One gleaming peak, as white, as lone As you could think the great white throne Stood up against the cobalt blue, And kept companion with the stars Despite dusk walls or umber bars. XXV That wall, that hideous prison wall, That blackness, umber, amber hue, It cumbers you, encircles you, It mantles as a hearse's pall. Your eyes lift to the star-pricked sky, You lift your frosted face, you pray That e'en the sickly moon might stay A time, if but to see you die. Yet how it blinds you, body, soul! You can no longer keep control. Your feebled senses fall astray: You cannot think, you dare not say. XXVI And now such under gleam of light, Such blazing, flaming, frightful glare; Such sudden, deadly, lightning gleam, Some like a monstrous, mad nightmare— Such hideous light, born of such night! It burst, with changeful interval, From out the ice beneath the wall, From out the groaning, surging stream That breathed, or tried to breathe, in vain, That struggled, strangled, shrieked with pain! 'Twas as if he of Patmos read, Sat by with burning pen and said, With piteous and prophetic voice, “The earth shall pass with rustling noise.” XXVII Swift out the ice-crack, fiery red, Swift up the umber wall and back, Then 'round and 'round, up, down and back, The sudden lightning sped and sped, Until the walls hung burnished red, An instant red, then yellow, white, With something more than earthly light. XXVIII It blinds your eyes until they burn, Until you dare not look or turn, But think of him who saw and told The story of, the glory of, The jasper walls, the streets of gold, Where trails God's unseen garments' hem The holy New Jerusalem. XXIX Then while he trudged he tried to think— And then another sudden light, Or red or yellow, blue or white, Burst up from out the very brink Of where he passed and, left or right, It burnished yet again the walls! Then up, straight up against the stars That seemed as jostled, rent with jars! Then silent night. Where next and when? Then blank, black interval, and then— And oh, those blank, dread intervals, This writing on the umber walls! XXX The blazing Borealis passed, The umber walls fell down at last And left the great cathedral stars,— I named the great stars that seemed to perch on the peaks and steeps close at either hand as we ascended the ice floor of the Yukon, “Cathedral stars” simply because they looked it at the time, although ordinarily they seemed to be normal stars, except that they were incredibly large and their five horns far brighter than rays of the sun. But when a seam or stream of flame would burst from the edge of the river's bed and suddenly take possession, for a few seconds, of heaven and earth, they would flare up like things of life, their five horns of gold pointing straight up like cathedral spires. Then as suddenly all would be black, umber, amber, cobalt, and the great, glittering stars again would be normal. I had, to my dismay, as a hired scribe when trying to get from Klondike to the Bering Sea by way of the Yukon—1897—found the river closed at the edge of the Arctic circle. It was nearly two thousand miles to the sea, all ice and snow, with not so much as a dog-track before me and only midnight 'round about me. There was nothing to do but to try to get back to my cabin on the Klondike. In the line of my employment I kept a journal of the solitary seventy-two days and nights—mostly night— spent in the silent and terrible ascent of the savage sea of ice. But enough; a tithe of the scenes, the colors, the unnatural phenomena in these lines would be weary work and dreary reading. Nor have I time or disposition, even in this note, to explain, urge or argue. Briefly, then, “The Borealis race,” as seen even by Burns in Scotland, is a substance. It is not only visible and varied, but it is tangible and subject to the law of gravitation, although a certain, or rather uncertain, sort of electricity. It is born of friction; yet it is as cold as the electric force which we have harnessed is hot; and I believe that a full charge of it, when suddenly bursting from a rent or fissure in the ice, is deadly; else why do the dogs fall down and whine when they hear and see it shoot up too near at hand? I can no more account for the manifold colors than I can for the little gathering of cardinal hues when you smite the transparent ice covering a lake or river. I can only say that it would take the keen eyes of a Lyons silk-weaver to distinguish and name the colors that burst up through the ice from the groaning, grinding waters of the Yukon; but the prevailing colors are positive; that is, red, yellow, saffron, crimson and so on. And these seem most forceful if they do not burst forth at an angle and collide and carrom and burnish the walls 'round about. They seem to influence the stars, as they leap up, up and up. But the colder colors seem more slow and heavy. I once saw a slanting, steel-colored column break overhead and fall to pieces right in my path. It lay like a dull, mobile smoke on the snow for some seconds. As the dogs sat down and whined, I jerked off a glove and tried to take some of it in my hand. I may have fancied it, but it seemed to sting and tingle like a little battery; and it surely was as cold as death. I spent some time with the Bishop of Selkirk, on Mission Island, trying to get some light on all this, for he had been hereabouts for near thirty years; but the good man seemed to depend on what he had read, rather than what he had seen, contenting himself with admiring the works of God and the glory of it all. He gave me his London book, “The Bible Under the Northern Lights,” from which I have pilfered generously. When I told him that I had come to a positive conclusion on the points set down, he said: “Well, maybe it all comes from friction, but you must know that the same phenomena is seen at Great Slave Lake, as well as on the seas of northern Greenland. No, it is as well to say that it is all the glory of God.” The five-horned stars, blent, burnished bars Of gold, red, gleaming, blinding gold— And still the cold, the killing cold! XXXI The moon resumed all heaven now, She shepherded the stars below Along her wide, white steeps of snow, Nor stooped nor rested, where or how. She bared her full white breast, she dared The sun e'er show his face again. She seemed to know no change, she kept Carousal constantly, nor slept, Nor turned aside a breath, nor spared The fearful meaning, the mad pain, The weary eyes, the poor, dazed brain That came at last to feel, to see The dread, dead touch of lunacy. XXXII How loud the silence! Oh, how loud! How more than beautiful the shroud Of dead Light in the moon-mad north When great torch-tipping stars stand forth Above the black, slow-moving pall As at some fearful funeral! XXXIII The moon blares as mad trumpets blare To marshaled warriors long and loud: The cobalt blue knows not a cloud, But oh, beware that moon, beware Her ghostly, graveyard, moon-mad stare! XXXIV Beware white silence more than white! Beware the five-horned starry rune; Beware the groaning gorge below; Beware the wide, white world of snow, Where trees hang white as hooded nun— No thing not white, not one, not one, But most beware that mad white moon. XXXV All day, all day, all night, all night— Nay, nay, not yet or night or day. Just whiteness, whiteness, ghastly white Made doubly white by that mad moon And strange stars jangled out of tune! XXXVI At last he saw, or seemed to see, Above, beyond, another world. Far up the ice-hung path there curled A red-veined cloud, a canopy That topt the fearful ice-built peak That seemed to prop the very porch Of God's house; then, as if a torch Burned fierce, there flashed a fiery streak, A flush, a blush on heaven's cheek! XXXVII The dogs sat down, men sat the sled And watched the flush, the blush of red. The little woolly dogs they knew, Yet scarce knew what they were about. They thrust their noses up and out, They drank the Light, what else to do? Their little feet, so worn, so true, Could scarce keep quiet for delight. They knew, they knew, how much they knew The mighty breaking up of night! Their bright eyes sparkled with such joy That they at last should see loved Light! The tandem sudden broke all rule, Swung back, each leaping like a boy Let loose from some dark, ugly school— Leaped up and tried to lick his hand— Stood up as happy children stand. XXXVIII How tenderly God's finger set His crimson flower on that height Above the battered walls of night! A little space it flourished yet, And then His angel, His first-born, Burst through, as on that primal morn! XXXIX His right hand held a sword of flame, His left hand javelins of light; And swift down, down, right down he came! His bright wings wide as the wide sky, And right and left, and hip and thigh, He smote the marshaled hosts of night With all his majesty and might. XL The scared moon paled and she forgot Her pomp and pride and turned to fly. The ice-heaved palisades, the high Heaved peaks that propped God's house, the stars That flamed above the prison bars, As battle stars with fury fraught, Were burned to ruin and were not. XLI Then glad earth shook her raiment wide, And free and far, and stood up tall, As some proud woman, satisfied, Forgets, and yet remembers all. She stood exultant, till her form, A queen above some battle storm, Blazed with the glory, the delight Of battle with the hosts of night. And night was broken. Light at last Lay on the Yukon. Night had passed. CANTO III I The days grew longer, stronger, yet The strong man grew then as a child. Too hard the tension and too wild The terror; he could not forget. And now at last when Light was, now He could not see nor lift his eyes, Nor lift a hand in any wise. It was as when a race is won By some strong favorite athlete, Then sinks down dying at your feet. II The red chief led him on and on To his high lodge by gorged Yukon And housed him kindly as his own, Blind, broken, dazed, and so alone! III The low bark lodge was desolate, And deathly cold by night, by day. Poor, hungered children of the snows, They heaped the fire as he froze, Did all they could, yet what could they But pity his most piteous fate And pitying, silent, watch and wait? IV His face was ever to the wall Or buried in his skins; the light— He could not bear the light of day Nor bear the heaped-up flame at night— Not bear one touch of light at all. There are no pains, no sharp death throes, So dread as blindness of the snows. V He thought of home, he thought of her, Thought most of her, and pictured how She walked in springtime splendor where Warm sea winds twined her heavy hair In great Greek braids piled fold on fold, Or loosely blown, as poppy's gold. VI And then he thought of her afar Mid follies, and his soul at war With self, self will, and iron fate Grew as a blackened thing of hate! And then he prayed forgiveness, prayed As one in sin and sore afraid. VII And praying so he dreamed, he dreamed She sat there looking in his face, Sat silent by in that dread place, Sat silent weeping, so it seemed, Sat still, sat weeping silently. He saw her tears and yet he knew, The blind man knew he could not see, Scarce hope to see for years and years. And then he seemed to hear her tears, To hear them steal her loose hair through And gently fall, as falls the dew And still, small rain of summer morn, That makes for harvests, yellow corn. VIII He raised his hand, he touched her hair; He did not start, he did not say; It seemed that she was surely there; He only questioned would she stay. How glad he was! Why, now, what care For hunger, blindness, blinding pain, Could he but touch her hair again? IX He heard her rise, give quick command To patient, skin-clad, savage men To heap the wood, come, go, and then Go feed their woolly friends at hand, To bring fresh stores, still heap fresh flame, Then go, then come, as morning came. X All seemed so real! He dared not stir, Lest he might break this dream of her. How holy, holy sweet her voice, Like benediction o'er the dead! So glad he was, so grateful he, And thanking God most fervently, Forgot his plight, forgot his pain, And deep at heart did he rejoice; Yet prayed he might not wake again To peril, blindness, piteous pain. XI Then, as he hid his face, she came And leaned quite near and took his hand. 'Twas cold, 'twas very cold, 'twas thin And bony, black, just skin and bone, Just bone and wrinkled mummy-skin. She held it out against the flame, Then pressed it with her two warm hands. It seemed as she could feel the sands Of life slow sift to shadow land. Close on his hurt eyes she laid hand, The while she, wearied, nodded, slept. The flame burned low, the wind's wild moan Awakened her. Cold as a stone His starved form, shrunken to a shade, Stretched in the darkness, and, dismayed, She put the robes back and she crept Close down beside and softly laid Her warm, strong form to his and slept, The while her dusk men vigil kept. XII That long, long night, that needed rest! Then flames at morn; her precious store Heaped hard by on the earthen floor While mute brown men, starved men, stood by To wait the slightest breath or sigh Or sign of wakening request— What silence, patience, trust! What rest! Of all good things, I say the best Beneath God's sun is rest, and—rest. XIII She slowly wakened from her sleep To find him sleeping, silent, deep! What food for all, what feast for all, To chief or slave, or great or small, Ranged round the flaming, glowing heap— Such lank, lean flank, such hungry zest! Such reach of limb, such rest, such rest! XIV Why, he had gone, had gladly gone In quest of his eternal Light, Beyond all dolours, that dread night, Had she not reached her hand and drawn, Hard drawn him back and held him so, Held him so hard he could not go. And yet he lingered by the brink, As dulled and dazed as you can think— Long, long he lingered, helpless lay, A babe, a broken pot of clay. XV She made a broader couch, she sat All day beside and held his hand Lest he might sudden slip away. And she all night beside him lay, Lest these last grains of sinking sand Might in the still night slip and pass, With none at hand to turn the glass. XVI And did the red men prate thereat? Why, they had laid them down and died For her, those simple dusky sons Of nature, children of the snows, Born where the ice-bound river runs, Born where the Arctic torrent flows. Look you for evil? Look for ill Or good, you find just what you will. XVII He spake no more than babe might speak: His eyes were as the kitten's eyes That open slowly with surprise Then close as if to sleep a week; But still he held, as if he knew, The warm, strong hand, the healthful hand, The dauntless, daring hand and true, Nor, while he waked, would his unfold, But held, as drowning man might hold Who hopes no more of life or land, But, as from habit, clutches hand. XVIII Once, as she thought he surely slept, She slowly drew herself aside, He thrust his hand as terrified, Caught back her hand, kissed it and wept. Then she, too, wept, wept tears like rain, Her first warm, welcome happy tears, Drew in her breath, put by her fears And knew she had not dared in vain. XIX Yet day by day, hard on the brink He hung with half-averted head, As silent, listless, as the dead, As sad to see as you can think. Their lorn lodge sat the terraced steep Above the wide, wild, groaning stream That, like some monster in a dream, Cried out in broken, breathless sleep; And looking down, night after night, She saw leap forth that sword of Light. XX She guessed, she knew the flaming sword That turned which way to watch and ward And guard the wall and ever guard The Tree of Life, as it is writ. The hand, the hilt, she could not see, Nor yet the true, life-giving tree, Nor cherubim that cherished it, But yet she saw the flaming sword, As written in the Book, the Word. XXI She held his hand, he did not stir, And as she nightly sat and sat, She silent gazed and guessed thereat. His fancies seemed to come to her; She could not see the Tree of Life, How fair it grew or where it grew, But this she knew and surely knew, That gleaming sword meant holy strife To keep and guard the Tree of Life. XXII Oh, flaming sword, rest not nor rust! The Tree of Life is hewn and torn, The Tree of Life is bowed and worn, The Tree of Life is in the dust. Hew brute man down, hew branch and root, Till he may spare the Tree of Life, The pale, the piteous woman, wife— Till he shall learn, as learn he must, To lift her fair face from the dust. XXIII She watched the wabbly moose at morn Climb steeply up the further steep, Huge, solitary and forlorn. She saw him climb, turn, look and keep Scared watch, this wild, ungainly beast, This mateless, lost thing and the last That roamed before and since the flood— That climbed and climbed the topmost hill As if he heard the deluge still. XXIV The sparse, brown children of the snow Began to stir, as sap is stirred In springtime by the song of bird, And trudge by, wearily and slow, Beneath their load of dappled skins That weighed them down as weighty sins. XXV And oft they paused, turned and looked back Along their desolate white track, With arched hand raised to shield their eyes— Looked back as if for something lost Or left behind, of precious cost, Sad-eyed and silent, mutely wise, As just expelled from Paradise. XXVI How sad their dark, fixed faces seemed, As if of long-remembered sins! They listless moved, as if they dreamed, As if they knew not where to go In all their wide, white world of snow. She could but think upon the day God made them garments from the skins Of beasts, then turned and bade them go, Go forth as willed they, to and fro. XXVII Between the cloud-capt walls of snow A wide-winged raven, croaking low, Passed and repassed, each weary day, And would not rest, not go, not stay, But ever, ever to and fro, As when forth from the ark of old; And ever as he passed, each day Let fall one croak, so cold, so cold It seemed to strike the ice below And break in fragments hard as fate; It fell so cold, so desolate. XXVIII At last the sun hung hot and high, Hung where that heartless moon had hung. A dove-hued moose bird sudden sung And had glad answerings hard by; The icy steeps began to pour Mad tumult down the rock-built steep. The great Yukon began to roar, As if with pain in broken sleep. The breaking ice began to groan, The very mountains seemed to moan. XXIX Then, bursting like a cannon's boom, The great stream broke its icy bands, And rushed and ran with outstretched hands That laid hard hold the willow lands, Rent wide the somber, gopher gloom And roared for room, for room, for room! XXX The stalwart moose climbed hard his steep, Climbed till he wallowed, brisket deep, In soft'ning, sinking steeps of snow, Then raging, turned to look below. XXXI He tossed, shook high his antlered head, Blew blast on blast through his huge nose, Then, wild with savage rage and fright, He climbed, climbed to the highest height, As if he felt the flood once more Had come to swallow sea and shore. XXXII The waters sank, the man uprose, A boat of skins, his Eskimo, Then down from out the world of snow They passed tow'rd seas of calm repose Where wide sails waited, warm sea wind, For mango isles and tamarind. XXXIII What wonders ward these Arctic seas! What dread, dumb, midnight days are these! A wonder world of night and light; A land of blackness blent with white, A land of water, ices, snow, Where ice is emperor and floe And berg and pack and jam and drift Forever grind and gnaw and lift And tide about the bleak North Pole— Where bull whales bellow, blow and blow Great rainbows in their lover's quest With all a sunland lover's zest! A land of contradictions and A desolated dead man's land! A land of neither life nor soul; A land where isles on isles of bone And totem towns lie lifeless, lone— Their tombstones just a totem pole. XXXIV Their cedar boat deep ballasted With bags of bleak, Koyukuk's gold, An ancient Bedford salt at head, Drives through the ice floes, jolly, bold! What isles! Saghalien beyond, Bleak, blown Saghalien, where bear And wild men are as one and share Their caves and shaggy coats of hair In close affection, warm and fond. At least, so ran the jolly tale Of him who steered them on and on Tow'rd Saghalien from far Yukon— This Bedford salt who lassoed whales, Or said he did, of largest size, And so, according, made his tales Of whales to fit in size his lies, The while they sailed tow'rd Saghalien. XXXV What worlds, these wild Aleutian Isles! What wonder worlds, unnamed, unknown! They lift a thousand icy miles From Unalaska, bleak and lone And bare as icebergs anywhere, Save where the white fox, black fox, red, Starts from his ice and snow-built bed, And like some strange bird flits the air. You sometimes see the white sea bear, A mother seal with babe asleep Held close to breast in careful keep, And hear a thousand sea birds scream And see the wide-winged albatross In silence bear his shadow cross As still and restful as a dream— Naught else is here; here life is not; 'Tis as the land that God forgot. XXXVI And yet it was not always so; This old salt tells a thousand tales Of love and joy, of weal and woe, That happened in the long ago When reindeer ranged the mossy vales That dot this thousand miles of isles; That here the fond Aleutian maid, With naught to fright or make afraid, Lived, loved and silent went her way As yon swift albatross in grey. But totem towns have naught to say Of all her tears and all her smiles. XXXVII And this, one of so many tales, This Bedford salt in quest of whales! He tells of one once favored isle Far out, a full five hundred mile, Where dwelt a Russian giant, knave, A pirate, priest, and all in one, With many wives, and reindeer white As Saint Elias in the sun; Yet every wife was as a slave To herd his white deer night by night And day by day to pluck away Each hair that was not perfect white. XXXVIII “And,” says this bearded Bedford salt, This man of whales and wondrous tales Of seas of ice and Arctic gales, This truthful salt without one fault— “White reindeer's milk is yellow gold And he who drinks it lives for aye; He will not drown, he cannot die, Nor hunger, thirst, nor yet grow cold, But live and live a thousand lives— Ten thousand deer, two thousand wives. XXXIX “And what the end?” He turns his quid, This ancient, sea-baked, Bedford man— “The thing blowed up, you bet it did, A bloomin' big volcano, and So bright that you can stand and write Your log most any bloomin' night, Five hundred miles away to-day. Them deers? They're now the milky way.” But now enough of hairy men, Of monstrous beasts before the flood, White Arctic chine, black gopher wood, Of flower-fed skies, of ice-sown seas; Come, let us court love-land again. Behold, how good is love, how fair! Behold, how fair is love, how good! A sense of burning sandalwood Is in my nostrils and the air Is redolent of cherry trees Red, pink, and brown with Nippon bees. BOOK THIRD CANTO I I Of all fair trees to look upon, Of all trees “pleasant to the sight,” Give me the Poet's tree of white— Pink cherry trees of blest Nippon With lovers passing to and fro— Pink cherry lanes of Tokio: Ten thousand cherry trees and each Hung white with Poet's plaint and speech. II Of all fair lands to look upon, To feel, to breathe, at Orient dawn, I count this baby land the best, Because here all things rest and rest And all men love all things most fair And beautiful and rich and rare; And women are as cherry trees With treasures laden, brown with bees. III Of all loved lands to look upon, Give me this love land of Nippon, Its bright, brave men, its maids at prayer, Its peace, its carelessness of care. IV A mobile sea of silver mist Sweeps up for morn to mount upon: Then yellow, saffron, amethyst— Such changeful hues has blest Nippon! See but this sunrise, then forget All scenes, all suns, all lands save one, Just matin sun and vesper sun; This land of inland seas of light; This land that hardly recks of night. V The vesper sun of blest Nippon Sinks crimson in the Yellow Sea: The purple butterfly is gone, The rainbow bird housed in his tree— Hushed, as the last loved, trembling note Still thrills his tuneful Orient throat— Hushed, as the harper's weary hand Waits morn to waken and command. VI Fast homeward bound, brown, busy feet In wooden shoon clang up the street; But not through all the thousand year In Buddha's temple may you hear One step, see hue of sun or sea, Though wait you through eternity: All is so still, so soft, subdued— The very walls are hueless hued. VII Behold brown, kneeling penitents! What perfumed place of silent prayer! Burned Senko-ho, sweet frankincense! And hear what silence everywhere! Pale, pensive priests pass here and there And silent lisp with bended head The Golden Rule on scrolls of gold As gentle, ancient Buddhists read These precepts sacred unto them, And watched the world grow old, so old, Ere yet the Babe of Bethlehem. VIII How leaps the altar's forky flame! How dreamful, dense, the sweet incense, As pale priests burn, in Buddha's name, Red-written sins of penitents— Mute penitents with bended head And unsaid sins writ deep in red. IX Now slow a priest with staff and scroll, Barefoot, as mendicant, and old— You sudden start, you lift your head, You hear and yet you do not hear, A sound, a song, so sweet, so dear It well might waken yonder dead. His staff has touched the sacred bowl Of copper, silver, shot with gold And wrought so magic-like of old That all sweet sounds, or east or west, Sought this still hollow where to rest. Hear, hear the voice of Buddha's bell, Bonsho-no-oto! All is well! X And you, you, lean, lean low to hear: You doubt your ears, you doubt your eyes, Your hand is lifted to your ear, You fear, how cruelly you fear The melody may die—it dies— Dies as the swan dies, as the sun Dies, bathed in dewy benison. XI It lives again; you breathe again! What cadences that speak, that stir, Take form and presence, as of her Whom first you loved, ere yet of men. It utters essence as a sound; As Santalum sends from the ground For devotee and worshipper Where saints lie buried, balm and myrrh. XII But now so low, so faint, so low You lean to hear yet hardly hear. Again your hand is to your ear, Your lips are parted, leaning so, And now again you catch your breath! Such breath as when you lie becalmed At sea, and sudden start to feel A cooling wave and quickened keel And see your tall sail court the shore. You hear, you more than hear, you feel, As when the white wave shimmereth. Your love is at your side once more, An essence of some song embalmed, Long hidden in the house of death— You breathe it, as your Lady's breath! XIII Now low, so low, so soft, so still, As when a single leaf is stirred, As when some doubtful matin bird Dreams russet morning decks his hill— Then nearer, clearer, lilts each note And longer, stronger, swells each wave— Ten thousand dead have burst the grave, An angel's song in every throat! The forky flame turns and returns To burn and burn red sins away; Such incense on the altar burns As some may breathe but none may say, Though cherished to their dying day. XIV And now the sandaled pilgrims fall With faces to the jeweled floor— The incense darkens as a pall, As clouds that darken more and more. You dare not lift your bended head— The silence is as if the dead Alone had passed the temple door. And now the Bonsho notes, the song! So stronger now, so strong, so strong! XV The black smokes of the ashen urn Where brown priests burn red sins away Begin to stir, to start, to turn, To seek the huge, bossed copper door— As evil things that dare not stay. The while the rich notes roll and roar To drive dread, burned sin out before Calm Dia-busta, the adored, As cherubim with flaming sword. XVI And far, so far, such rich notes roll That barefoot fishers far at sea Fall prone and pray all silently For wife and babes that wait the strand, The tugging net clutched tight in hand, The while they bow a space to pray; For every asking, eager soul Knows well the time and patiently It lists, an hundred Ri away. XVII The thousand pilgrims girt in straw That press Fujame's holy peak, Prone, fasting, penitent and meek, Hear notes as from the stars and pray, As we who know and keep the Law— As we who walk Jerusalem With pilgrim step and pallid cheek. How earnestly they silent pray To keep their Golden Rule alway, To do no thing, or night or day, Though tempted by a diadem, They would not others do to them! XVIII And wee, brown wives, on high, wild steeps Of terraced rice or bamboo patch Where toil, hard toil incessant, keeps Sweet virtue, sweet sleep, and a thatch, They hear and hold, with closer fold, Their bare, brown babes against the cold. They croon and croon, with soothing care, To babes meshed in their mighty hair, And loving, crooning, breathe a prayer. XIX The great notes pass, pass on and on, As light sweeps up the doors of dawn, And now the strong notes are no more, But feebler tones wail out and cry, As sad things that have lost their way At night and dare not bide the day But turn back to the shrine to die, And steal in softly through the door And gently fade along the floor. XX The barefoot priest slow fades from sight, Faint and more faint the last notes fall; You hear them now, then not at all, And now the last note of the night Wails out, as when a lover cries At night, and at the altar dies. XXI How sweet, how sad, how piteous sweet This last note at the bowed monk's feet That dies as dies some saintly light— That dies so like the sweet swan dies— So loving sad, so tearful sweet, This last, lost note—Good night, good night. Good night to holy Buddha's bell— Bonsho-no-oto! All is well— A mist is rising to the eyes! CANTO II I This water town of Tokio Is as a church with priests at prayer, With restful silence everywhere, Or night or day, or high or low. You sometimes hear a turtle dove, A locust trilling from his tree In chorus with his mated love, May see a raven in the air, Wide-winged and high, but even he Is as a shadow in the stream, As dreamful, silent as a dream. II They could but note the silent maids That carried, with a mother's care, The silent baby, ofttimes bare As birthtime through their Caran shades. Ten thousand babies, everywhere, But not one wail, or day or night, To put the locust's love to flight, Or mar the chorus of the dove. And why? Why, they were born of love: Born soberly, born sanely, clean, As Indian babes of old were born Ere yet the white man's face was seen, Ere yet the sensuous white man came; Born clean as love, of lovelight born Some long lost Rocky Mountain morn Where snow-topt turrets first took flame And flashed God's image in God's name! III Tell me, my flint-scarred pioneer, My skin-clad Carson, mountaineer, Who met red Sioux, met dusk Modoc, Red hand to hand in battle shock Where men but met to dare and die, Did ever you once see or hear One poor brown Indian baby cry? IV The long, hot march by ashen plain, The burning trail by lava bed, Babes lashed to back in corded pain Until the swollen bare legs bled, But on and on their mothers led, If but to find a place to die. Yet who, of all men that pursued This dying race, year after year, By burning plain or beetling wood, Did ever see, did ever hear, One bleeding Indian baby cry? V The starving mother's breasts were dry, There scarce was time to stop and drink, The swollen legs grew black as ink— There was not even time to die. And yet, through all this fifty year, What hounding man did ever hear One piteous Indian baby cry? VI Nay, they were born as men were born Far back in Jacob's Bible morn; Were born of love, born lovingly, Unlike the fretful child of lust, When love gat love and trust gat trust— And trusting, dared to silent die In torture and disdain a tear, If mother willed, nor question why. Yea, I have seen so many die, This cruel, hard, half-hundred year, And I have cried, to see, to hear— But never heard one baby cry. VII Shot down in Castle Rocks I lay One midnight, lay as one shot dead, A lad, and lone, years, years of yore. I heard deep Sacramento roar, Saw Shasta glitter far away— I never saw such moon before And yet I could not turn my head, Nor move my lips to cry or say. Red arrows in both form and face Held form and face tight pinned in place Against the gnarled, black chaparral, As one fast nailed against a wall With scant half room to wholly fall— The hot, thick, gurgling, gasping breath, The thirst, the thirsting unto death! VIII And then a child against my feet Crawled feebly and crept close to die; I moaned, “Oh baby, won't you cry? 'Twould be as music piteous sweet To hear in this dread place of death Just one lorn cry, just one sweet breath Of life, here 'mid the moonlit dead, The mingled dead, white men and red. IX “Oh bleeding, blood-red baby, cry Just once before I, choking die! And maybe some white man will hear In yonder fortressed camp anear And bring blest drink for you and I— Oh, baby, please, please, baby, cry!” X A crackling in the chaparral And then a lion in the clear From which the dying babe had crept, Swift as a yellow sunbeam, leapt And stood so tall, so near, so near! So cruel near, so sinuous, tall— Some Landseer's picture on a wall. XI I never saw such length of limb, Such arm as God had given him! His paws, they swallowed up the earth, His midnight eyes shot arrows out The while his tail whipped swift about— His tail was surely twice his girth! XII His nostrils wide with smell of blood Reached out above us where he stood And snuffed the dank, death-laden air Till half his yellow teeth were bare. His yellow length was bare and lank— I never saw such hollow flank; 'Twas as a grave is, as a pall, A flabby black flank—scarce at all! XIII He sudden quivered, tail to jaws, Crouched low, unsheathed his shining claws— “Oh, baby, baby, won't you cry, Just once before we two must die?” I felt him spring, clutch up, then leap Swift down the rock-built, broken steep; I heard a crunch of bones, but I— I did not hear that baby cry! CANTO III I I would forget—help me forget, The while we fondly linger yet The flower-field so sweet, so sweet, With Buddha at fair Fuji's feet. Fair Fuji-san, throned Queen of air! Fair woman pure as maiden's prayer; As pure as prayer to the throne Of God, as lone as God, as lone As Buddha at her feet in prayer— Fair Fuji-san, so more than fair! II Fair Fuji-san, Kamkura, and Reposeful, calm Buddha the blest, With folded hands that rest and rest On eld Kamkura's blood-soaked sand. Here russet apples hang at hand So russet rich that when they fall 'Tis as if some gold-bounden ball Sank in the loamy, warm, wet sand Where hana, kusa, carpet earth That never knows one day of dearth. III Kamkura, where Samurai bled, Where Buddha sits to rest and rest! Was ever spot so beauteous, blest? Was ever red rose quite so red? IV Fair Fuji from her mountain chine Above her curtained courts of pine Looks down on calm Kamkura's sea So tranquil, dreamful, restfully You fold your arms across your breast And rest with her, with Buddha rest, While silence musks the warm sea air— Just silence, silence everywhere. V Here midst this rest, this pure repose, This benediction, peace, and prayer, That as religion was, and where A breath of senko blessed the air, The erstwhile children of the snows Came silently and sat them down Within a Kusa coigne that lay Above the buried Bushi town, Above the dimpled, beauteous Bay Of sun and shadow, gold and brown, And Care blew by the other way— A breath, a butterfly, a fay. VI And one was as fair as Fuji, fair, True, trusting as some maid at prayer, Aye, one as Buddha was, but one Was turbulent of blood and was An instant of the earth and sun; As when the ice-tied torrent thaws And sudden leaps from frost and snow Headlong and lawless, far below— As when the sap flows suddenly And warms the wind-tost mango tree. VII He caught her hand, he pressed her side, He pressed her close and very close, He breathed her as you breathe a rose, Nor was in any wise denied. Her comely, shapely limbs pushed out As elden on her golden shore; Her long, strong arms reached round about And bent along the flowered floor, While full length on her back she lay Like some wild, beauteous beast at play. VIII He thrust him forward, caught her, caught Her form as if she were of naught. His outstretched face was as a flame, His breath was as a furnace is, He kissed her mouth with such mad kiss Her rich, full lips shut tight with shame. IX As one of old who tilled the mould, Took triple strength from earth and thrust His burly foeman to the dust, She sprang straight up, and springing threw Him from her with such voltage he Knew not how he might, writhing, rise, Or dare to meet again those eyes That seemed to burn him through and through; Or daring, how could he undo His coward, selfish deed of shame Enforced as in religion's name? And she so trustful, so alone! 'Twas as if some sweet, sacred nun Had opened wide her door to one Who slew her on her altar stone. X She passed and silent passed and slow. What strength, what length of limb, what eyes! She left him lying low, so low, So crested and so surely slain He deemed he never more might rise, Or rising, see her face again. And yet, her look was not of hate, But pity, as akin to pain; And when she touched the temple gate She paused, turned, beckoned he should go, Go wash his hands of carnal clay And go alone his selfish way— Forever, ever and a day! CANTO IV I How cold she grew, how chilled, how changed, Since that loathed scene by Nippon's sea! No longer flexile, trustful, she Held him aloof, hushed and estranged, A fallen star, yet still her star, And she his heaven, earth, his all, To follow, worship, near or far, Let good befall or ill befall. But he was silent. He had sold His birthright, sold for even less Than any poor, cheap pottage mess, His right to speak forth, warm and bold, And look her unshamed in the face. Mute, penitent, he kept his place, As silent as that Nippon saint That knew not prayer, praise, or plaint. II Saint Silence seems some maid of prayer, God's arm about her when she prays And where she prays and everywhere, Or storm-strewn or sun-down days. What ill to Silence can befall, Since Silence knows no ill at all? III Saint Silence seems some twilight sky That leans as with her weight of stars To rest, to rest, no more to roam, But rest and rest eternally. She loosens and lets down the bars, She brings the kind-eyed cattle home, She breathes the fragrant field of hay And heaven is not far away. IV The deeps of soul are still the deeps Where stately Silence ever keeps High court with calm Nirvana, where No shallows break the noisy shore Or beat, with sad, incessant roar, The fettered, fevered world of care As noisome vultures fret the air. V The star-sown seas of thought are still, As when God's plowmen plant their corn Along the mellow grooves at morn In patient trust to wait His will. The star-sown seas of thought are wide, But voiceless, noiseless, deep as night; Disturb not these, the silent seas Are sacred unto souls allied, As golden poppies unto bees. Here, from the first, rude giants wrought, Here delved, here scattered stars of thought To grow, to bloom in years unborn, As grows the gold-horned yellow corn. VI They lay low-bosomed on the bay Of Honolulu, soft the breeze And soft the dreamful light that lay On Honolulu's Sabbath seas— The ghost of sunshine gone away— Red roses on the dust of day, Pale, pink, red roses in the west Where lay in state dead Day at rest. VII Their dusky boatman set his face From out the argent, opal sea Tow'rd where his once proud, warlike race Lay housed in everlasting dust. He sang low-voiced, sad, silently, In listless chorus with the tide, Because his race was not, because His sun-born race had dared, defied The highest, holiest of His laws And so fell stricken and so died— Died stricken of dread leprosy Begot of lust—prone in the dust— Degenerating love to lust. VIII Sweet sandal-wood burned bow and stern In colored, shapely crates of clay; Sweet sandal-wood long laid away, Long caverned with dead battle kings Whose dim ghosts rise betimes and burn The torch and touch sweet taro strings— Such giant, stalwart, stately kings! IX Sweet sandal-wood, long ages torn From cloud-capt steeps where thunders slept, Then hidden where dead giants kept Their sealed Walhalla, waiting morn— Deep-hidden, till such sweet perfume Betrayed their long-forgotten tomb. X The sea's perfume and incense lay About, above, lay everywhere; The sea swung incense through the air— The censer, Honolulu's Bay. And then the song, the soft, low rune, As sad, as if dead kings kept tune. XI The moon hung twilight from each horn, Soft, silken twilight, soft to touch As baby lips—and over much Like to the baby breath of morn. Huge, five-horned stars swung left and right O'er argent, opal, amber night. XII What changeful, dreamful, ardent light, When Mauna Loa, far afield, Uprose and shook his yellow shield Below the battlements of night; Below the Southern Cross, o'er seas That sang such silent symphonies! XIII Far lava peaks still lit the night, Like holy candles foot and head, That dimly burned above the dead, Above the dead and buried Light. There rose such perfume of the sea, Such Sabbath breath, soft, silently, As when some burning censer swings, As when some surpliced choir sings. XIV He scarce had lived save in such fear, But now yon mitered tongues of flame That tipped the star-lit lava peak Brought back some fervor to his cheek And made him half forget his shame. He could but heed, he could but hear That call across the walls of night From triple mitered tongues of Light, That soulful, silent, perfumed night. He said—and yet he said no word; No word he said, yet all she heard, So close their souls lay, in such Light, That holy Honolulu night. XV “Lies yonder Nebo's mount, my Soul?— The Promised Land beyond, beyond The grave of rest, the broken bond, Where manly force must lose control, Must press the grapes and fill the bowl, Go round and round, rest, rise up, eat, Tread grapes, then wash the wearied feet? XVI “I know I have enough of bliss, I know full well I should not dare To ask a deeper joy than this, This scene, your presence, this soft air, This incense, this deep sense of rest Where long-sought, sweet Arcadia lies Against these gates of Paradise. XVII “And yet, hear me, I dare ask more. Lone Adam had all Paradise And still how poor he was, how poor, With all things his beneath the skies! Aye, sweet it were to roam or rest, To ever rest and ever roam As you might reck and reckon best; But still there comes a sense of home, Of hearthstone, happy babes at play, And you and I—not far away. XVIII “Nay, do not turn aside your face— ‘Be fruitful ye and multiply’ Meant all; it meant the human race, And he or she shall surely die Despised and pass to nothingness Who does not love the little dress, The heaven in the mother's eyes, The holy, sacred, sweet surprise The time she tells how truly blest, With face laid blushing to his breast. XIX “How flower-like the little frock— The daffodil forerunning spring— The doll-like shoes, socks, everything, And each a secret, secret stored! And yet each day the little hoard, As careful merchants note their stock, Is noted with such happy care As only angel mothers share. XX “At last to hear her rock and rock— Behold her bowed Madonna face! She lifts her baby from its place, Pulls down the crumpled, dampened frock, And never Cleopatra guessed The queenliness, the joy, the pride, She knows with baby to her breast— His chub fists churning either sides! XXI “The bravest breast faith ever bared For brother, country, creed or friend, However high the aim or end, Was that brave breast a baby shared With kicking, fat legs half unfrocked, The while sweet mother rocked and rocked.” CANTO V I As when first blossoms feel first bees, As when the squirrel hoists full sail And leaps his world of maple trees And quirks his saucy, tossy tail; As when Vermont's tall sugar trees First feel sweet sap, then don their leaves In haste—a million Mother Eves; As when strange winds stir strong-built ships Long ice-bound fast in Arctic seas, So she, the strong, full woman now, Felt new life thrilling breast and brow And tingled to her finger tips. Her limbs pushed out, outreached her head As if to say—she nothing said. But something of the tender light That lit her girl face that first night, The time she pulling poppies sat The sod and saw the golden sheep Safe housed within the hollowed deep, Was hers; and how she blushed thereat! Yet blushing so, still silent sat. II She would forget his weakness, yet Try as she would, could not forget. He knew her thought. She raised her head And searched his soul, and searching said: “He who would save the world must stand Hard by the world with steel-mailed hand And save by smiting hip and thigh. The world needs truth, tall truth and grand, And keen sword-cuts that thrust to kill. The man who climbed the windy hill To talk, is talking, climbing still, And could not help or hurt a fly. The stoutest swimmer and most wise Swims somewhat with the sweeping stream, Yet leads, leads unseen as a dream. The strong fool breasts the flood and dies, The weak fool turns his back and flies.” III He did not answer, could not dare Lift his shamed eyes to her fair face, But looked right, left, looked anywhere, And mused, mused mutely out of place: “If yonder creedists may not teach, For all their books, and bravely preach That here, right here, the womb of night Gave us God's first-born, holy Light, Why, pity, nor yet blame them quite; Because they know not, cannot read, Save as commanded by some creed. What eons they may have to wait Within their wall, without the gate, Nor once dare lift their eyes to look Beyond their blinding creed and book, We know not, but we surely know Yon lava-lifted, star-tipt height Is bannered still by that first Light. We know this phosphorescent glow, At every dip of dripping oar, Is but lost bits of Light below, Where moves God's spirit as of yore. Aye, here, right here, from out the night, God spake and said: ‘Let there be light!’ IV “And dare ask doubting, creed-made men Why we so surely know and how? Why here ‘the waters,’ now as then? Why here ‘the waters,’ then as now? We know because we read, yet read So little that we much must heed. We read: ‘God's spirit moved upon The waters’ ere that burst of dawn. What waters? Why, ‘The Waters,’ these, These soundless, silent, sundown seas. V “The morning of the world was here, 'Twas here ‘He made dry land appear,’ Here ‘Darkness lay upon the deep.’ What deep? This deep, the deepest deep That ever rolled beneath the sun When night and day were then as one And dreamless day lay fast asleep, Rocked in this cradle of the deep.” VI She would not, could not be denied Her thought, her theme but turned once more, As turns the all-devouring tide Against a stubborn unclean shore, With lifted face and soul aflame, And spake as speaking in God's name— With face raised to the living God: “Hear me! How pitiful the plea Of men who plead their temperance, Of men who know not one first sense Of self-control, yet, fire-shod, Storm forth and rage intemperately At sins that are but as a breath, Compared with their low lives of death! VII “And oh, for prophet's tongue or pen To scourge, not only, and accuse The childless mother, but such men As know their loves but to abuse! Give me the brave, child-loving Jew, The full-sexed Jew of either sex, Who loves, brings forth and nothing recks Of care or cost, as Christians do— Dulled souls who will not hear or see How Christ once raised his lowly head And, all rebuking, gently said, The while he took them tenderly, ‘Let little ones come unto me.’ VIII “The true Jew lover keeps the Way. For clean, serene, and contrite heart The bride and bridegroom kneel apart Before the bridal bed and pray. IX “Behold how great the bride's estate! Behold how holy, pure the thought That high Jehovah welcomes her In partnership, to coin, create The fairest form He yet has wrought Since Adam's clay knew breath and stir: To glory in her daughters, sons; To be God's tabernacle, tent, The keeper of the covenant, The mother of His little ones! X “Go forth among this homeless race, This landless race that knows no place Or name or nation quite its own, And see their happy babes at play, Or palace, Ghetto, rich or poor, As thick as birds about the door At morn, some sunny Vermont May, Then think of Christ and these alone. Yet ye deride, ye jeer, ye jibe, To see their plenteous babes; ye say ‘Behold the Jew and all his tribe!’ XI “Yet Solomon upon his throne Was not more kingly crowned than they These Jews, these jeered Jews of to-day— More surely born to lord, to lead, To sow the land with Abram's seed; Because their babes are healthful born And welcomed as the welcome morn. XII “Hear me this prophecy and heed! Except we cleanse us, kirk and creed, Except we wash us, word and deed, The Jew shall rule us, reign the Jew. And just because the Jew is true, Is true to nature, true to truth, Is clean, is chaste, as trustful Ruth Who stood amid the alien corn In tears that far, dim, doubtful morn— Who bore us David, Solomon— The Babe, that far, first Christmas dawn. XIII “You shrink, are angered at my speech? You dare avert your doubtful face Because I name this chaste, strange race? So be it then; there lies the beach, And up the beach the ways divide. I would not leave the truth untold To win the whole world to my side, Nor would I spare your selfish pride, Your carnal coarseness, lustful lie, For that would be to let you die. Come! yonder lifts the clear, white Light For seamen, souls sea-tost at night. XIV “I see the spiked Agave's plume, The pepsin's plume, acacia's bloom Far up beyond tall cocoa trees, Tall tamarind and mango brown, That gird the pretty, peaceful town. That lane leads up, the church looks down— There lies the ways, now which of these? Bear with me, I must dare be true. The nation, aye, the Christian race, Now fronts its stern Sphynx, face to face, And I must say, say here to you, Whate'er the cost of love, of fame, The Christian is a thing of shame— Must say because you prove it true, The better Christian is the Jew. XV “I know you scorn the narrow deeds Of men who make their god of creeds— Yon men as narrow as the miles That bank their rare, sweet flower-fed isles, But come, my Lost Star, come with me To yon fond church, high-built and fair, For God is there, as everywhere, Or Arctic snow or argent sea.” XVI He looked far up the mango lane Below the wide-boughed banyan tree; He looked to her, then looked again, As one who tries yet could not see But one steep, narrow, upward way: “You said two ways, here seems but one, Or set of moon or rise of sun, But one way to the perfect day, And I will go. And you must stay?” She looked far up the steep of stone And said: “Aye, go, but not alone.” XVII The boat's prow pushed the cocoa shore, The man spake not, but, leaning o'er, Strong-armed, he drew her to his side And was not anywise denied. He pointed to the failing fire, That still tipt lava peak and spire, While stars pinned round the robe of night; 'Twas here God said, “Let there be Light!” XVIII A little church, a lava wall, A soft light looking gently down, The Light of Christ, the second light, Where two as one passed up the town. She gave her hand, she gave her all, And said, as such brave women might, With ample right, in hallowed cause: “As it in the beginning was, So let the man-child be full born Of Love, of Light, the Light of Morn!” BOOK FOUR CANTO I I And which of all Hawaii's isles Of sandal wood and singing wilds Received and housed this maiden rare— This bravest, best, since Eve's despair? It matters not; enough to know Night-blooming trumpets ever blow Love's tuneful banner to the breeze In chorus with the ardent seas; That Juno walks her mountain wall In peacock plumes the whole year through. You hear her gaudy lover call From dawn till dusk, then see them fall From out the clouds far, far below, And droop and drift slow to and fro— Dusk rainbows blending with the dew. II And had he won her? He had wed, But now it was that he must woo, Must keep alone his widowed bed Or sit and woo the whole night through. He plead. He could not touch her hand; Her eyes held anger and command And memories of a trustful time He would have made her muck and slime. III He plead his perfect life, still plead; But spurning him she mocking said: “You would have trailed me in the dust In very drunkenness of lust— And now you dare to meekly plead Your love of Light, your studious youth, Your strenuous toil, your quest of truth, Your perfect life! Indeed! Indeed! IV “Behold the pale, wan, outworn wife Of him who pleads his perfect life! Her step is slow, she waits for death; Hear, hear her wan babe's hollow cry! He scarce can cry above a breath. Poor babe! begotten but to die, Or, harder fate, live feebly on, The shame of mother, curse of state— Half-witted, worthless, jest of fate. V Behold God's image, fashioned tall As heaven, stooping down to crawl Upon his belly as a snake, Ere yet this sense is well awake, Ere yet his force has come, ere yet The child-wife knows but to regret. And lo! the greatest is the least; For man lies lower than the beast. VI “Such pity that sweet love should lie Prone, strangled in its bed of shame, And no man dare to publish why! Such pity that in slain Love's name The weak bring forth the weaker, bring The leper, idiot, anything That lawless passion can beget! Sweet pity, pity for them all— The child that cries, child-wife that dies, The weakling that may linger yet A feeble day to feebly fall— As food for sword or cannon ball, For prison wall or charity Or fruit of gruesome gallows tree! VII “But pity most poor man, blind man, Whose passions stoop him to a span. Why, man, each well-born man was born To dwell in everlasting morn, To top the mountain as a tower, A thousand years of pride and power; To face the four winds with the face Of youth until full length he lies— Still God-like, even as he dies. VIII “Could I but teach lorn man to live, But teach low man to truly love, Could I but teach blind man to see, How gladly he would turn to me And give great thanks, and ever give Glad heed, as to some soft-voiced dove. IX “The burning cities of the plain, The high-built harlot, Babylon, The bannered mur'ls of Rome undone, That rose again and fell again To ashes and to heaps of dust, All died because man lived in vain; Because man sold his soul to lust. X “And count what crimes have come of it! I say all sins, or said or writ, Lie gathered here in this dark pit Of man's licentious, mad desire, Where woman's form is ruthless thrown, As on some sacrificial stone, And burned as in a living fire, To leave but ashes, rue, and ire. XI “Aye, even crimes as yet unnamed Are born of man's degrading lust. The wildest beast man ever tamed, Or ever yet has come to know— The vilest beast would feel disgust Could it but know how low, how low God's image sinks in much and slime, In crimes so deeper than all crime, In slime that hath not yet a name, And yet man knows no whit of shame! XII “Poor, weak, mad man, so halt, so blind! Poor, weak, mad man that must carouse And prostitute what he should house And husband for his coming kind! Behold the dumb beasts at glad morn, Clean beasts that hold them well in hand! How nobler thus to lord the land, How nobler thus to love your race, To house its health and strength and grace, Than rob the races yet unborn And build new Babylons to scorn! XIII “I say that each man has a right, The right the beast has to be born Full-flowered, beauteous, free and fair As wide-winged bird that rides the air; Not as a babe that cries all night, Cries, cries in darkness for such Light As man should give it at its birth. I say that poor babe has a right, The right, at least, of each wild beast— Aye, red babe, black, white, west or east, To rise at birth and lord the earth, Strong-limbed, long-limbed, robust and free As supple beast or towering tree. XIV “God's pity for the breasts that bear A little babe, then banish it To stranger hands, to alien care, To live or die as chance sees fit. Poor, helpless hands, reached anywhere, As God gave them to reach and reach, With only helplessness in each! Poor little hands, pushed here, pushed there, And all night long for mother's breast: Poor, restless hands that will not rest And gather strength to reach out strong To mother in the rosy morn! Nay, nay, they gather scorn for scorn And hate for hate the lorn night long— Poor, dying babe! to reach about In blackness, as a thing cast out! XV “God's pity for the thing of lust Who bears a frail babe to be thrust Forth from her arms to alien thrall, As shutting out the light of day, As shutting off God's very breath! But thrice God's pity, let us pray, For her who bears no babe at all, But, grinning, leads the dance of death. That sexless, steel-braced breast of bone Is like to some assassin cell, A whited sepulchre of stone, A graveyard at the gates of hell, A mart where motherhood is sold, A house of murders manifold!” CANTO II I He heard; he could but bow his head In silence, penitence, and shame, Confess the truth of all she said Of crimes committed in Love's name, Nor beg the sacred seal of red To marriage bond and marriage bed. II And that was all, aye, that was all For days, for days that seemed as years. He still must woo, put by her fears, Make her his friend, let what befall; Bide her sweet will and, loving, bide Meek dalliance with his maiden bride. III One night in May, such soulful night Of cherry blossoms, birds, such birds As burst with song, that sing outright Because so glad they cannot keep Their song, but sing out in their sleep! Such noisy night, a cricket's night, A night of Katydids, of dogs That bayed and bayed the vast full moon In chorus with glad, tuneful frogs— With May's head in the lap of June. How hot, how sultry hot the room! Their garden tree in perfect bloom Gave out fair Nippon's full perfume— The night grew warm and very warm, And warm her warm, full-bosomed form! IV How vital, virile, strong with life, The world without, the maiden wife! How wondrous fair the world, how fair The maid meshed in her mighty hair! The man uprose, caught close a skin, A lion's skin, threw this about His great, Herculean, pent-up form, Thrust feet into his slippered shoes, Then, with a lion's force and frown He strode the wide room up and down, The skin's claws flapping at his thews. He turned, he caught her suddenly And instant wrapped her close within; Then down the stairs and back and out Beneath the blossomed Nippon tree— Against the tree he pressed her form, He was so warm, so very warm— He held her close as close could be Against the blossomed cherry tree. V He held with all his might and main— Held her so hard he shook the tree, Because he trembled mightily And shook in his hard, happy pain— Because he quivered as a pine When tropic storm sweeps up the line, As when some swift horse, harnessed low, Frets hard and bites the bit to go. She laughed such low, sweet laugh, and said, The while she raised her pretty head, “Please, please, be gentle good to me, And please don't hurt the cherry tree.” VI The warm land lay as in a swoon, Full length, the happy lap of June— A fair bride fainting with delight And fond forgetfulness with night. How warm the world was and how wise The world is in its love of life, Its hate of harshness, hate of strife, Its love of Eden, peace that lies In love-set, leaf-sown Paradise! VII How generous, how good is night To give its length to man's delight— To give its strength from dusk till morn To push the planted yellow corn! How warm this garden was, how warm With life, with love in any form! Two lowly crickets, clad in black, Came shyly forth, shrank sudden back— Then chirped in chorus, side by side; And oh, their narrow world was wide As oceans, light their hearts as air, And oh, their little world was fair, And oh, their little world was warm Because each had a lover there, Because they loved and didn't care. VIII How languid all things with delight, With sensuous longings, sweet desire That burned as with immortal fire, Immortal love that burns to live And, lives to burn, to take, to give, Create, bring forth, and loving share With God the fruitage, flesh or flower— Just loving, loving, bud or bower, Or bee or birdling, small or great, Just loving, loving to create, With just one caution, just one care— That all creation shall be fair. IX The very garden wall was warm With gorgeous sunshine gone away; Each vine, with eager, reaching arm, Clung amorous, tiptoed to kiss, With eager lips, the ardent clay That held her to its breast of bliss. X Blown cherry blossoms basking lay, A perfect pathway of perfume; The tiger lily scarce had room For roses bending in a storm Of laden sweetness more than sweet. The moon leaned o'er the garden wall, Then, smiling, tiptoed up her way, The while she let one full beam fall, Love-laden in the sensuous heat, So sweet, so warm, so still withal, Love heard pink cherry blossoms fall. XI A Katydid laid his green thigh Against another leaf-green form And so began to sing and sigh, As if it were his time to die From stress and strain of passion's storm— He, too, was warm and very warm. XII A tasseled hammock, silken red, Swung, hung hard by, and foot and head, A blossom-laden cherry tree. This famed tree of the Japanese, Whatever other trees may be, Is held most sacred of all trees: Not quite because of its perfume, Not all because of rich pink bloom, But much because its blossomed boughs Not only list to lover's vows, But true to lovers, ever true, Refuse to let one moonbeam through. XIII Here, close beneath this Nippon tree, The sweetest tree this side Cathay, The lover's tree of mystery, Where not a thread of moonlight lay, While waves of moonlight laughed and played At hide and seek the other way, He threw her, full length, from his arm; Full length, then raised her drooping head, Threw back the skin and, blushing red, He sought to say—He nothing said! He nothing did but blush and blush And feel his hot blood rush and rush— The very hammock's fringe was warm The while he leaned low from his place And felt her warm breath in his face. XIV Then, all abashed, he trembled so He clutched the hammock hard and fast, He held so hard it came, at last, To swing, to swing fast to and fro. Such awkwardness! He clutched, let go, Then clutched so hard he shook each tree Till perfumed silence came to see— Till fragrance fell upon her hair, Such hair, a storm of pink and snow. How fair, how fair, how sensuous fair, Half hidden in a pink snow-storm; And yet how warm, how more than warm! XV How shamed he was! His great heart beat As beats some signal for retreat. This stupid, bravest of brave men, Confused, dismayed, hung down his head, Then turned and helplessly had fled, Had she not reached a timid hand And, half as pleading, half command And half-way laughing, shyly said, From out her snood of snow and rain, “Please shake the Nippon trees again!” XVI He shook the trees; a fragrant shower On laughing face and loosened hair— A flash of perfume and of flower— Oh, she was fair and very fair! Then with a sudden strength he plucked His red-ripe cherry from the tree, Wound 'round the skin and loosely tucked The folds about her modestly, Then on and up with giant stride He bore his blushing maiden bride, So cherry ripe, so cherry red, And laid her in her bridal bed— Laid perfumed bride, laid flesh and flower, Half drowning from the fragrant shower. What snows strewn in her ample hair, What low, light laughter everywhere, Or cherry tree, or step or stair! Just low, soft laughter, cherry bloom, Just love and love's unnamed perfume. XVII He tossed the lion's skin aside, With folded arms leaned o'er his bride, Turned low the light, then stood full length, Then strode in all his supple strength The room a time, tossed back his hair, Then to his bride, swift bent to her, And kneeled, as lowliest worshiper. XVIII And then he threw him by her side, His long, strong limbs thrown out full length, His two fists full of housed-up strength. What pride, what manly, kingly pride That he had conquered, bravely slain His baser self, was self again! XIX He held a hand exceeding small, He breathed her perfume, threw her hair Across her breast with such sweet care He scarce did touch her form at all. Again he rose, strode to and fro, Came back and turned the light quite low. XX He bowed his face close to her feet; Now he would rise, then would not rise; He bent, blushed to his very eyes, Then sudden pushed aside the sheet And kissed her pink and pearly toes. Their perfume was the perfect rose When perfect summer, passion, heat, Points both hands of the clock straight up, As when we lift and drain the cup, As when we lift two hands and pray When we have lived our bravest day, The horologue of life may stop With both hands pointing to the top. XXI Then suddenly, in strength and pride, Full length he threw him at her side And caught again her timid hand, A bird that had escaped his snare. He caught it hard, he held it there, He begged her pardon, begged and prayed She would forgive him, then he laid His face to her face and the land Was like a fairy land. They lay As children well outworn at play. XXII As children bounding from their bed, So rested, radiant, satisfied With self and selfishness denied, Life seemed some merry roundelay. They laughed with early morn, they led, So full of soul, of strength were they, The laughing dance of love all day. XXIII All day! A month of days, and each A song, a sermon, but to teach, A holy book to teach the truth Of endless, laughing, joyous youth. He stood so tall, he stood so strong— As one who holds the keys yet keeps His treasure housed in shining heaps, Until all life was as a song. XXIV At last, one warmest morning, she Would scarce let go, said o'er and o'er, Held close his hand, held hard the door, “Good-by! Come early back to me!” And then, close up beside, as one Might eager seek some stout oak tree When storm is sudden threatened, she Put up her pretty, pouting mouth, Half closed her laughing, saucy eyes— Such lips, such roses from the south, The warm, south side of Paradise!— XXV “Good-by! Come early back to me!” Why, he heard nothing else all day, Saw nothing else, knew naught but this, Their fond, fond, first full-flowered kiss, Wherein she led the rosy way, As is her right, as it should be. He looked his watch hard in its face A hundred times, he blushed, he smiled, Did leave his friends and lightly pace The street, half laughing, as a child. A million kisses! He'd had one— Scant one, his joy had just begun! XXVI Come early? He was at the gate And through the door ere yet the day Had kneeled down in the west to pray Its vesper prayer, all brimming o'er And blushing that he could not wait To kiss her just once more, once more; Take breath then kiss her o'er and o'er. XXVII By some sweet chance he found her there, Close fenced against the winding stair, With no escape, behind, before. She put her lips up as to plead She might be spared a little space; But there was mischief in her face, A world of frolic and of fun, And he could run as he could read, Aye, he could read as he could run. And then she pushed her full lips out: “You are so strong, you hold so fast! You know I tried to guard the door.” And then she frowned, began to pout And sighed, “Dear, dear, 'tis not well done!” And then he caught her close, and then He kissed her once, twice, thrice again. XXVIII Then days and many days of this— Ah! man, make merry and carouse Upon your way, within your house, Hold right there in your manly hand, Your happy maid who waits your kiss; Carouse on kisses and carouse In soul, the livelong, thronging day When duty tears you well away, To know what waits you at the gate, And waiting loves and loves to wait. XXIX And how to kiss? A thousand ways, And each way new and each way true, And each way true and each way new Each day for thrice ten thousand days. XXX How loyal he who loves, how grand! He does not tell her overmuch, He does not sigh or seek to touch Her garments' hem or lily hand; She is his soul, his life, his light, His saint by day, his shrine by night. XXXI True love leads home his maiden bride Low-voiced and tender, soft and true; He leans to her, to woo, to woo, As if she still turned and denied— No selfish touch, no sated kiss To kill and dig the grave of bliss. XXXII True love will hold his maiden bride As nobles hold inheritance; He will not part with one small pence Of her fair strength and stately pride, But wait serenely at her side, Supremely proud, full satisfied. XXXIII Why, what a glorious thing to view! Each morn a maiden at your side, The one fair woman, maid and bride, With all her sweetness waiting you! How wise the miser, more than wise, Who knows to count and keep such prize! XXXIV How glad the coming home of him Who knows a maiden waits and waits, All pulsing, still, within his gates, To kiss his goblet's golden brim; How joyous still to woo and woo, To read the old new story through! XXXV Ah me, behold what heritage! What light by which to walk, to live This age when lights resplendent burn, This glorious, shining, new-born age, When love can bravely give and give And get thrice tenfold in return, If man will only love and learn! XXXVI And now soft colors through the house Began to surely bud and bloom; The wise, the fair, far-seeing spouse Began to deck the bridal room; Began to build, as builds a bird, When first footfalls of spring are heard. XXXVII Some warm-toned colors on the wall, Then gorgeous, grass-like carpetings Strown, sown with lily, pink and all That nature in sweet springtime brings; Then curtains from the Orient, The silken couch, soft as a kiss, The music born of love and blent But rarely with such loves as this; Mute music, where not hand of man Or foot of man is seen or heard, Such soft, sweet sound as only can In happy blossom time be heard— Be heard from happy, nested bird. XXXVIII And now full twelve o'clock, the noon Of faithful, trustful, wedded love, The two hands pointing straight above, This vast midnight, this argent June! Their noon was midnight and the moon Came through the silken sheen and laid A sword of silver at her side. And peace, sweet, perfect peace was hers, As when nor bird nor blossom stirs, And she was now no more afraid; The moon surrendered to the maid, Drew back and softly turned aside, As bridesmaid turning from the bride. XXXIX All voiceless, noiseless, tenderly He pressed beside her, took her hand— He took her from the leaning moon, And far beyond the amber sea, They sailed the seas of afternoon— The far, still seas, so grandly grand, Until they came to babyland. And there Creation was and there Were giants in the land, once more, Long-lived and valiant as of yore, Yet gentle, patient as His Prayer. SIT LUX Let me explain that this was penned amid the scenes described, in order to get the color, action, and atmosphere, and that from time to time fragments were in print during my wanderings; so you may find bits in the book not entirely new. But as these were photographs, so far as I could make them, they must remain unchanged. My aspiration is and ever has been, in my dim and uncertain way, to be a sort of Columbus—or a Cortez. “And if I perish, I perish.” But I need room. I need not only the latitude but even the longitude of all known oceans and of all glorious nature to sail these uncharted buccaneer seas. For the tribute of song and story must be not only worthy them but of sympathetic interest and sincere concern to you, my ardent reader. Besides and above all, despising the hazard of new work and ways, I aspire to picture the matchless, magnificent, and terrible splendors of our gold-strown and flame-fed Arctic Empire. At the same time, please let me pioneer a little further and try to set the banner of Song on the sunlit Islands, along the sea bank of everlasting Summer, and over against the cloud-born battlements of our mighty American Ocean. The body of this was published in Boston not long ago, under the name of “Light,” with the above note; the body, mind you, not the soul of it. Launched without its soul and shorn of its most significant lines it was as a ship without keel or captain and never once came fairly into port. Some passing ships saluted, some trumpet calls were heard across the waters. But it was, in the main as “a painted ship upon a painted ocean,” and to all appearances as purposeless. But I have seen too much sin and sorrow, born of ignorance, to dream idle dreams. My work is serious work and should serve definite purposes. The one simple and sublime law of nature, God, it seems to me is creation, and the one highest, holiest law, the flower of the garden, the best last of the uncompleted six days, the creation, the completion of perfect man. A Luther Burbank has arisen in the land to perfect, create, the fruit and the flowers; the Arab's love of beauty and action created the perfect stallion; the German's love of content and animal comfort has given us the perfect bull in his strength and glory; the ruddy, healthy, happy Briton has, in his determination to perpetuate comfort and content, created the perfect ram. But what race or nation or man or woman has risen up and cried aloud so as to be heard of all the world, “Come, let us now make man?” But, you ask, was it necessary to leave the sunny sea-bank, with poppies under foot and the wild oats waving in the wind, and fare forth into the ices of Alaska? I only know that we must have winter and frost and freezing cold where most things perish before spring. After the ices the Orient, then the Islands of eternal Summer, then the restful, trustful, holy human love; then marriage and, maybe, the perfect man. WITH LOVE TO YOU AND YOURS “And God said, Let there be light.” Rise up! How brief this little day? We can but kindle some dim light Here in the darkened, wooded way Before the gathering of night. Come, let us kindle it. The dawn Shall find us tenting farther on. Come, let us kindle ere we go— We know not where; but this we know, Night cometh on, and man needs light. Come! camp-fire embers, ere we grope Yon gray archway of night. Life is so brief, so very brief, So rounded in, we scarce can see The fruitage grown amid the leaf And foliage of a single tree In all God's garden; yet we know That goodly fruits must grow and grow Beyond our vision. We but stand In some deep hollow of God's hand, Hear some sweet bird its little day, See cloud and sun a season pass, And then, sweet friend, away! Clouds pass, they come again; and we, Are we, then, less than these to God? Oh, for the stout faith of a tree That drops its small seeds to the sod, Safe in the hollow of God's hand, And knows that perish from the land It shall not! Yea, this much we know, That each, as best it can, shall grow As God has fashioned, fair or plain, To do its best, or cloud or sun, Or in His still, small rain. Oh, good to see is faith in God! But better far is faith in good: The one seems but a sign, a nod, The one seems God's own flesh and blood. How many names of God are sung! But good is good in every tongue. And this the light, the Holy Light That leads thro' night and night and night; Thro' nights named Death, that lie between The days named Life, the ladder round Unto the Infinite Unseen. “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth; the earth was without form and void and darkness lay upon the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.” PART FIRST I What is there in a dear dove's eyes, Or voice of mated melodies, That tells us ever of blue skies And cease of deluge on Love's seas? The dove looked down on Jordan's tide Well pleased with Christ the Crucified; The dove was hewed in Karnak stone Before fair Jordan's banks were known. The dove has such a patient look, I read rest in her pretty eyes As in the Holy Book. I think if I should love some day— And may I die when dear Love dies— I'd sail brave San Francisco's Bay And seek to see some sea-dove's eyes: To see her in her air-built nest, Her wide, warm, restful wings at rest; To see her rounded neck reach out, Her eyes lean lovingly about; And seeing this as love can see, I then should know, and surely know, That love sailed on with me. II See once this boundless bay and live, See once this beauteous bay and love, See once this warm, bright bay and give God thanks for olive branch and dove. Then plunge headlong yon sapphire sea And sail and sail the world with me. . . . Some isles, drowned in the drowning sun, Ten thousand sea-doves voiced as one; Lo! love's wings furled and wings unfurled; Who sees not this warm, half-world sea, Sees not, knows not the world. How knocks he at the Golden Gate, This lord of waters, strong and bold, And fearful-voiced and fierce as fate, And hoar and old, as Time is old; Yet young as when God's finger lay Against Night's forehead that first day, And drove vast Darkness forth, and rent The waters from the firmament. Hear how he knocks and raves and loves! He woos us through the Golden Gate With all his soft sea-doves. Now on and on, up, down, and on, The sea is oily grooves; the air Is as your bride's sweet breath at dawn When all your ardent youth is there. And oh, the rest! and oh, the room! And oh, the sensuous sea perfume! Yon new moon peering as we passed Has scarce escaped our topmost mast. A porpoise, wheeling restlessly, Quick draws a bright, black, dripping blade, Then sheathes it in the sea. Vast, half-world, wondrous sea of ours! Dread, unknown deep of all sea deeps! What fragrance from thy strange sea-flowers Deep-gardened where God's silence keeps! Thy song is silence, and thy face Is God's face in His holy place. Thy billows swing sweet censer foam, Where stars hang His cathedral's dome. Such blue above, below such blue! These burly winds so tall, they can Scarce walk between the two. Such room of sea! Such room of sky! Such room to draw a soul-full breath! Such room to live! Such room to die! Such room to roam in after death! White room, with sapphire room set 'round, And still beyond His room profound; Such room-bound boundlessness o'erhead As never has been writ or said Or seen, save by the favored few, Where kings of thought play chess with stars Across their board of blue. III The proud ship wrapped her in the red That hung from heaven, then the gray, The soft dove-gray that shrouds the dead And prostrate form of perfumed day: Some noisy, pigmy creatures kept The deck a spell, then, leaning, crept Apart in silence and distrust, Then down below in deep disgust. An albatross,—a shadow cross Hung at the head of buried day,— At foot the albatross. Then came a warm soft, sultry breath— A weary wind that wanted rest; A breath as from some house of death With flowers heaped; as from the breast Of such sweet princess as had slept Some thousand years embalmed, and kept, In fearful Karnak's tomb-hewn hill, Her perfume and spiced sweetness still,— Such breath as bees droop down to meet, And creep along lest it may melt Their honey-laden feet. The captain's trumpet smote the air! Swift men, like spiders up a thread, Swept suddenly. Then masts were bare As when tall poplars' leaves are shed, And ropes were clamped and stays were clewed. 'T was as when wrestlers, iron-thewed, Gird tight their loins, take full breath, And set firm face, as fronting death. Three small brown birds, or gray, so small, So ghostly still and swift they passed, They scarce seemed birds at all. Then quick, keen saber-cuts, like ice; Then sudden hail, like battle-shot, Then two last men crept down like mice, And man, poor, pigmy man, was not. The great ship shivered, as with cold— An instant staggered back, then bold As Theodosia, to her waist In waters, stood erect and faced Black thunder; and she kept her way And laughed red lightning from her face As on some gala day. The black sea-horses rode in row; Their white manes tossing to the night But made the blackness blacker grow From flashing, phosphorescent light. And how like hurdle steeds they leapt! The low moon burst; the black troop swept Right through her hollow, on and on. A wave-wet simitar was drawn, Flashed twice, flashed thrice triumphantly, But still the steeds dashed on, dashed on, And drowned her in the sea. What headlong winds that lost their way At sea, and wailed out for the shore! How shook the orient doors of day With all this mad, tumultuous roar! Black clouds, shot through with stars of red; Strange stars, storm-born and fire-fed; Lost stars that came, and went, and came; Such stars as never yet had name. The far sea-lions on their isles Upheaved their huge heads terrified, And moaned a thousand miles. What fearful battle-field! What space For light and darkness, flame and flood! Lo! Light and Darkness, face to face, In battle harness battling stood! And how the surged sea burst upon The granite gates of Oregon! There is a small granite island, or great rock standing on pillars, eight miles off Cape Blanco. Fishermen may row their boats between these columns and they call the rock The Gates. It tore, it tossed the seething spume, And wailed for room! and room! and room! It shook the crag-built eaglets' nest Until they screamed from out their clouds, Then rocked them back to rest. How fiercely reckless raged the war! Then suddenly no ghost of light, Or even glint of storm-born star. Just night, and black, torn bits of night; Just night, and midnight's middle noon, With all mad elements in tune; Just night, and that continuous roar Of wind, wind, night, and nothing more. Then all the hollows of the main Sank down so deep, it almost seemed The seas were hewn in twain. How deep the hollows of this deep! How high, how trembling high the crest! Ten thousand miles of surge and sweep And length and breadth of billow's breast! Up! up, as if against the skies! Down! down, as if no more to rise! The creaking wallow in the trough, As if the world was breaking off. The pigmies in their trough down there! Deep in their trough they tried to pray— To hide from God in prayer. Then boomed Alaska's great, first gun In battling ice and rattling hail; Then Indus came, four winds in one! Then came Japan in counter mail Of mad cross winds; and Waterloo Was but as some babe's tale unto. The typhoon spun his toy in play And whistled as a glad boy may To see his top spin at his feet: The captain on his bridge in ice, His sailors mailed in sleet. What unchained, unnamed, noises, space! What shoreless, boundless, rounded reach Of room was here! Fit field, fit place For three fierce emperors, where each Came armed with elements that make Or unmake seas and lands, that shake The heavens' roof, that freeze or burn The seas as they may please to turn. And such black silence! Not a sound Save whistling of that mad, glad boy To see his top spin round. Then swift, like some sulked Ajax, burst Thewed Thunder from his battle-tent; As if in pent-up, vengeful thirst For blood, the elements of Earth were rent, And sheeted crimson lay a wedge Of blood below black Thunder's edge. A pause. The typhoon turned, upwheeled, And wrestled Death till heaven reeled. Then Lightning reached a fiery rod, And on Death's fearful forehead wrote The autograph of God. IV God's name and face—what need of more? Morn came: calm came; and holy light, And warm, sweet weather, leaning o'er, Laid perfumes on the tomb of night. The three wee birds came dimly back And housed about the mast in black, And all the tranquil sense of morn Seemed as Dakota's fields of corn, Save that some great soul-breaking sigh Now sank the proud ship out of sight Now sent her to the sky. V One strong, strange man had kept the deck— One silent, seeing man, who knew The pulse of Nature, and could reck Her deepest heart-beats through and through. He knew the night, he loved the night. When elements went forth to fight His soul went with them without fear To hear God's voice, so few will hear. The swine had plunged them in the sea, The swine down there, but up on deck The captain, God and he. VI And oh, such sea-shell tints of light High o'er those wide sea-doors of dawn! Sail, sail the world for that one sight, Then satisfied, let time begone. The ship rose up to meet that light, Bright candles, tipped like tasseled corn, The holy virgin, maiden morn, Arrayed in woven gold and white. Put by the harp—hush minstrelsy; Nor bard or bird has yet been heard To sing this scene, this sea. VII Such light! such liquid, molten light! Such mantling, healthful, heartful morn! Such morning born of such mad night! Such night as never had been born! The man caught in his breath, his face Was lifted up to light and space; His hand dashed o'er his brow, as when Deep thoughts submerge the souls of men; And then he bowed, bowed mute, appalled At memory of scenes, such scenes As this swift morn recalled. He sought the ship's prow, as men seek The utmost limit for their feet, To lean, look forth, to list nor speak, Nor turn aside, nor yet retreat One inch from this far vantage-ground, Till he had pierced the dread profound And proved it false. And yet he knew Deep in his earth that all was true; So like it was to that first dawn When God had said, “Let there be light,” And thus he spake right on: “My soul was born ere light was born, When blackness was, as this black night. And then that morn, as this sweet morn! That sudden light, as this swift light! I had forgotten. Now, I know The travail of the world, the low, Dull creatures in the sea of slime That time committed unto time, As great men plant oaks patiently, Then turn in silence unto dust And wait the coming tree. “That long, lorn blackness, seams of flame, Volcanoes bursting from the slime, Huge, shapeless monsters without name Slow shaping in the loom of time; Slow weaving as a weaver weaves; So like as when some good man leaves His acorns to the centuries And waits the stout ancestral trees. But ah, so piteous, memory Reels back, as sickened, from that scene— It breaks the heart of me! “Volcanoes crying out for light! The very slime found tongues of fire! I saw this when with Capt. Eads at the mouth of our great river. The débris of more than a dozen States pouring into the warm waters of the Mexican seas creates fermentation which finds expression in volcanoes that spring flaming up out of the sea almost nightly. I know nothing so terrible as certain, or rather, uncertain nights in the Mississippi delta. Huge monsters climbing in their might O'er submerged monsters in the mire That heaved their slimy mouths, and cried And cried for light, and crying, died. How all that wailing through the air But seems as some unbroken prayer. One ceaseless prayer that long lorn night The world lay in the loom of time And waited so for light! “And I, amid those monsters there, A grade above, or still below? Nay, Time has never time to care; And I can scarcely dare to know. I but remember that one prayer; Ten thousand wide mouths in the air, Ten thousand monsters in their might, All eyeless, looking up for light. We prayed, we prayed as never man, By sea or land, by deed or word, Has prayed since light began. “Great sea-cows laid their fins upon Low-floating isles, as good priests lay Two holy hands, at early dawn, Upon the altar cloth to pray. Aye, ever so, with lifted head, Poor, slime-born creatures and slime-bred, We prayed. Our sealed-up eyes of night All lifting, lifting up for light. And I have paused to wonder, when This world will pray as we then prayed, What God may not give men! “Hist! Once, I saw,—What was I then? Ah, dim and devious the light Comes back, but I was not of men. And it is only such black night As this, that was of war and strife Of elements, can wake that life, That life in death, that black and cold And blind and loveless life of old. But hear! I saw—heed this and learn How old, how holy old is Love, However Time may turn: “I saw, I saw, or somehow felt, A sea-cow mother nurse her young. I saw, and with thanksgiving knelt, To see her head, low, loving, hung Above her nursling. Then the light, The lovelight from those eyes of night! I say to you 't was lovelight then That first lit up the eyes of men. I say to you lovelight was born Ere God laid hand to clay of man, Or ever that first morn. “What though a monster slew her so, The while she bowed and nursed her young? She leaned her head to take the blow, And dying, still the closer clung— And dying gave her life to save The helpless life she erstwhile gave, And so sank back below the slime, A torn shred in the loom of time. The one thing more I needs must say, That monster slew her and her young; But Love he could not slay.” PART SECOND I The man stood silent, peering past His utmost verge of memory. What lay beyond, beyond that vast Bewildering darkness and dead sea Of noisome vapors and dread night? No light! not any sense of light Beyond that life when Love was born On that first, far, dim rim of morn: No light beyond that beast that clung In darkness by the light of love And died to save her young. And yet we know life must have been Before that dark, dread life of pain; Life germs, love germs of gentle men, So small, so still; as still, small rain. But whence this life, this living soul, This germ that grows a godlike whole? I can but think of that sixth day When God first set His hand to clay, And did in His own image plan A perfect form, a manly form, A comely, godlike man. II Did soul germs grow down in the deeps, The while God's Spirit moved upon The waters? High-set Lima keeps A rose-path, like a ray of dawn; And simple, pious peons say Sweet Santa Rosa passed that way; And so, because of her fair fame And saintly face, these roses came. Shall we not say, ere that first morn, Where God moved, garmented in mists, Some sweet soul germs were born? III The strange, strong man still kept the prow; He saw, still saw before light was, The dawn of love, the huge sea-cow, The living slime, love's deathless laws. He knew love lived, lived ere a blade Of grass, or ever light was made; And love was in him, of him, as The light was on the sea of glass. It made his heart great, and he grew To look on God all unabashed; To look lost eons through. IV Illuming love! what talisman! That Word which makes the world go 'round! That Word which bore worlds in its plan! That Word which was the Word profound! That Word which was the great First Cause, Before light was, before sight was! I would not barter love for gold Enough to fill a tall ship's hold; Nay, not for great Victoria's worth— So great the sun sets not upon In all his round of earth. I would not barter love for all The silver spilling from the moon; I would not barter love at all Though you should coin each afternoon Of gold for centuries to be, And count the coin all down as free As conqueror fresh home from wars,— Coin sunset bars, coin heaven-born stars, Coin all below, coin all above, Count all down at my feet, yet I— I would not barter love. V The lone man started, stood as when A strong man hears, yet does not hear. He raised his hand, let fall, and then Quick arched his hand above his ear And leaned a little; yet no sound Broke through the vast, serene profound. Man's soul first knew some telephone In sense and language all its own. The tall man heard, yet did not hear; He saw, and yet he did not see A fair face near and dear. For there, half hiding, crouching there Against the capstan, coils on coils Of rope, some snow still in her hair, Like Time, too eager for his spoils, Was such fair face raised to his face As only dream of dreams give place; Such shyness, boldness, sea-shell tint, Such book as only God may print, Such tender, timid, holy look Of startled love and trust and hope,— A gold-bound story-book. And while the great ship rose and fell, Or rocked or rounded with the sea, He saw,—a little thing to tell, An idle, silly thing, maybe,— Where her right arms was bent to clasp Her robe's fold in some closer clasp, A little isle of melting snow That round about and to and fro And up and down kept eddying. It told so much, that idle isle, Yet such a little thing. It told she, too, was of a race Born ere the baby stars were born; She, too, familiar with God's face, Knew folly but to shun and scorn; She, too, all night had sat to read By heaven's light, to hear, to heed The awful voice of God, to grow In thought, to see, to feel, to know The harmony of elements That tear and toss the sea of seas To foam-built battle-tents. He saw that drifting isle of snow, As some lorn miner sees bright gold Seamed deep in quartz, and joys to know That here lies hidden wealth untold. And now his head was lifted strong, As glad men lift the head in song. He knew she, too, had spent the night As he, in all that wild delight Of tuneful elements; she, too, He knew, was of that olden time Ere oldest stars were new. VI Her soul's ancestral book bore date Beyond the peopling of the moon, Beyond the day when Saturn sate In royal cincture, and the boon Of light and life bestowed on stars And satellites; ere martial Mars Waxed red with battle rage and shook The porch of heaven with a look; Ere polar ice-shafts propt gaunt earth, And slime was but the womb of time, That knew not yet of birth. VII To be what thou wouldst truly be, Be bravely, truly, what thou art. The acorn houses the huge tree, And patient, silent bears its part, And bides the miracle of time. For miracle, and more sublime It is than all that has been writ, To see the great oak grow from it. But thus the soul grows, grows the heart,— To be what thou wouldst truly be, Be truly what thou art. To be what thou wouldst truly be, Be true. God's finger sets each seed, Or when or where we may not see; But God shall nourish to its need Each one, if but it dares be true; To do what it is set to do. Thy proud soul's heraldry? 'T is writ In every gentle action; it Can never be contested. Time Dates thy brave soul's ancestral book From thy first deed sublime. VIII Wouldst learn to know one little flower, Its perfume, perfect form and hue? Yea, wouldst thou have one perfect hour Of all the years that come to you? Then grow as God hath planted, grow A lordly oak or daisy low, As He hath set His garden; be Just what thou art, or grass or tree. Thy treasures up in heaven laid Await thy sure ascending soul, Life after life,—be not afraid! IX Wouldst know the secrets of the soil? Wouldst have Earth bare her breast to you? Wouldst know the sweet rest of hard toil? Be true, be true, be ever true! Ah me, these self-made cuts of wrong That hew men down! Behold the strong And comely Adam bound with lies And banished from his paradise! The serpent on his belly still Eats dirt through all his piteous days, Do penance as he will. Poor, hell-bruised, prostrate, tortuous snake! What soul crawls here upon the ground? God willed this soul at birth to take The round of beauteous things, the round Of earth, the round of boundless skies. It lied, and lo! how low it lies! What quick, sleek tongue to lie with here! Wast thou a broker but last year? Wast known to fame, wast rich and proud? Didst live a lie that thou mightst die With pockets in thy shroud? X Be still, be pitiful! that soul May yet be rich in peace as thine. Yea, as the shining ages roll That rich man's soul may rise and shine Beyond Orion; yet may reel The Pleiades with belts of steel That compass commerce in their reach; May learn and learn, and learning teach, The while his soul grows grandly old, How nobler far to share a crust Than hoard car-loads of gold! XI Oh, but to know; to surely know How strangely beautiful is light! How just one gleam of light will glow And grow more beautifully bright Than all the gold that ever lay Below the wide-arched Milky Way! “Let there be light!” and lo! the burst Of light in answer to the first Command of high Jehovah's voice! Let there be light for man to-night, That all men may rejoice. XII The little isle of ice and snow That in her gathered garment lay, And dashed and drifted to and fro Unhindered of her, went its way. The while the warm winds of Japan Were with them, and the silent man Stood by her, saying, hearing naught, Yet seeing, noting all; as one Sees not, yet all day sees the sun. He knew her silence, heeded well Her dignity of idle hands In this deep, tranquil spell. XIII The true soul surely knows its own, Deep down in this man's heart he knew, Somehow, somewhere along the zone Of time, his soul should come unto Its safe seaport, some pleasant land Of rest where she should reach a hand. He had not questioned God. His care Was to be worthy, fit to share The glory, peace, and perfect rest, Come how or when or where it comes, As God in time sees best. Her face reached forward, not to him, But forward, upward, as for light; For light that lay a silver rim Of sea-lit whiteness more than white. The vast full morning poured and spilled Its splendor down, and filled and filled And overfilled the heaped-up sea With silver molten suddenly. The night lay trenched in her meshed hair; The tint of sea-shells left the sea To make her more than fair. What massed, what matchless midnight hair! Her wide, sweet, sultry, drooping mouth, As droops some flower when the air Blows odors from the ardent South— That Sapphic, sensate, bended bow Of deadly archery; as though Love's legions fortressed there and sent Red arrows from his bow fell bent. Such apples! such sweet fruit concealed Of perfect womanhood make more Sweet pain than if revealed. XIV How good a thing it is to house Thy full heart treasures to that day When thou shalt take her, and carouse Thenceforth with her for aye and aye; How good a thing to give the store That thus the thousand years or more, Poor, hungered, holy worshiper, You kept for her, and only her! How well with all thy wealth to wait Or year, or thousand thousand years, Her coming at love's gate! XV The winds pressed warm from warm Japan Upon her pulsing womanhood. They fanned such fires in the man His face shone glory where he stood. In Persia's rose-fields, I have heard, There sings a sad, sweet, one-winged bird; Sings ever sad in lonely round Until his one-winged mate is found; And then, side laid to side, they rise So swift, so strong, they even dare The doorway of the skies. XVI How rich was he! how richer she! Such treasures up in heaven laid, Where moth and rust may never be, Nor thieves break in, or make afraid. Such treasures, where the tranquil soul Walks space, nor limit nor control Can know, but journeys on and on Beyond the golden gates of dawn; Beyond the outmost round of Mars; Where God's foot rocks the cradle of His new-born baby stars. XVII As one who comes upon a street, Or sudden turn in pleasant path, As one who suddenly may meet Some scene, some sound, some sense that hath A memory of olden days, Of days that long have gone their ways, She caught her breath, caught quick and fast Her breath, as if her whole life passed Before, and pendant to and fro Swung in the air before her eyes; And oh, her heart beat so! How her heart beat! Three thousand years Of weary, waiting womanhood, Of folded hands, of falling tears, Of lone soul-wending through dark wood; But now at last to meet once more Upon the bright, all-shining shore Of earth, in life's resplendent dawn, And he so fair to look upon! Tall Phaon and the world aglow! Tall Phaon, favored of the gods, And oh, her heart beat so! Her heart beat so, no word she spake; She pressed her palms, she leaned her face,— Her heart beat so, its beating brake The cord that held her robe in place About her wondrous, rounded throat, And in the warm winds let it float And fall upon her soft, round arm, So warm it made the morning warm. Then pink and pearl forsook her cheek, And, “Phaon, I am Sappho, I—” Nay, nay, she did not speak. And was this Sappho, she who sang When mournful Jeremiah wept? When harps, where weeping willows hang, Hung mute and all their music kept? Such witchery of song as drew The war-like world to hear her sing, As moons draw mad seas following. Aye, this was Sappho; Lesbos hill Had all been hers, and Tempos vale, And song sweet as to kill. Her dark Greek eyes turned to the sea; Lo, Phaon's ferry as of old! He kept his boat's prow still, and he Was stately, comely, strong, and bold As when he ferried gods, and drew Immortal youth from one who knew His scorn of gold. The Lesbian shore Lay yonder, and the rocky roar Against the promontory told, Told and retold her tale of love That never can grow old. Three thousand years! yet love was young And fair as when Æolis knew Her glory, and her great soul strung The harp that still sweeps ages through. Ionic dance or Doric war, Or purpled dove or dulcet car, Or unyoked dove or close-yoked dove, What meant it all but love and love? And at the naming of Love's name She raised her eyes, and lo! her doves! Just of old they came. PART THIRD I And they sailed on; the sea-doves sailed, And Love sailed with them. And there lay Such peace as never had prevailed On earth since dear Love's natal day. Great black-backed whales blew bows in clouds, Wee see-birds flitted through the shrouds. A wide-winged, amber albatross Blew by, and bore his shadow cross, And seemed to hang it on the mast, The while he followed far behind, The great ship flew so fast. She questioned her if Phaon knew, If he could dream, or halfway guess How she had tracked the ages through And trained her soul to gentleness Through many lives, through every part To make her worthy his great heart. Would Phaon turn and fly her still, With that fierce, proud, imperious will, And scorn her still, and still despise? She shuddered, turned aside her face, And lo, her sea-dove's eyes! II Then days of rest and restful nights; And love kept tryst as true love will, The prow their trysting-place. Delights Of silence, simply sitting still,— Of asking nothing, saying naught; For all that they had ever sought Sailed with them; words or deeds had been Impertinence, a selfish sin. And oh, to know how sweet a thing Is silence on those restful seas When Love's dove folds her wing! The great sea slept. In vast repose His pillowed head half-hidden lay, Half-drowned in dread Alaskan snows That stretch to where no man can say. His huge arms tossed to left, to right, Where black woods, banked like bits of night, As sleeping giants toss their arms At night about their fearful forms. A slim canoe, a night-bird's call, Some gray sea-doves, just these and Love, And Love indeed was all! III Far, far away such cradled Isles As Jason dreamed and Argos sought Surge up from endless watery miles! And thou, the pale high priest of thought, The everlasting thronèd king Of fair Samoa! Shall I bring Sweet sandal-wood? Or shall I lay Rich wreaths of California's bay From sobbing maidens? Stevenson, Sleep well. Thy work is done; well done! So bravely, bravely done! And Molokia's lord of love And tenderness, and piteous tears For stricken man! Go forth, O dove! With olive branch, and still the fears Of those he meekly died to save. They shall not perish. From that grave Shall grow such healing! such as He Gave stricken men by Galilee. Great ocean cradle, cradle, keep These two, the chosen of thy heart, Rocked in sweet, baby sleep. IV Fair land of flowers, land of flame, Of sun-born seas, of sea-born clime, Of clouds low shepherded and tame As white pet sheep at shearing time, Of great, white, generous high-born rain, Of rainbows builded not in vain— Of rainbows builded for the feet Of love to pass dry-shod and fleet From isle to isle, when smell of musk 'Mid twilight is, and one lone star Sits in the brow of dusk. Oh, dying, sad-voiced, sea-born maid! And plundered, dying, still sing on. Thy breast against the thorn is laid— Sing on, sing on, sweet dying swan. How pitiful! And so despoiled By those you fed, for whom you toiled! Aloha! Hail you, and farewell, Far echo of some lost sea-shell! Some song that lost its way at sea, Some sea-lost notes of nature, lost, That crying, came to me. Dusk maid, adieu! One sea-shell less! Sad sea-shell silenced and forgot. O Rachel in the wilderness, Wail on! Your children they are not. And they who took them, they who laid Hard hand, shall they not feel afraid? Shall they who in the name of God Robbed and enslaved, escape His rod? Give me some after-world afar From these hard men, for well I know Hell must be where they are. V Lo! suddenly the lone ship burst Upon an uncompleted world, A world so dazzling white, man durst Not face the flashing search-light hurled From heaven's snow-built battlements And high-heaved camp of cloud-wreathed tents. And boom! boom! boom! from sea or shore Came one long, deep, continuous roar, As if God wrought; as if the days, The first six pregnant mother morns, Had not quite gone their way. What word is fitting but the Word Here in this vast world-fashioning? What tongue here name the nameless Lord? What hand lay hand on anything? Come, let us coin new words of might And massiveness to name this light, This largeness, largeness everywhere! White rivers hanging in the air, Ice-tied through all eternity! Nay, peace! It were profane to say: We dare but hear and see. Be silent! Hear the strokes resound! 'T is God's hand rounding down the earth Take off thy shoes, 't is holy ground,— Behold! a continent has birth! The skies bow down, Madonna's blue Enfolds the sea in sapphire. You May lift, a little spell, your eyes And feast them on the ice-propped skies, And feast but for a little space: Then let thy face fall grateful down And let thy soul say grace. VI At anchor so, and all night through, The two before God's temple kept. He spake: “I know yon peak; I knew A deep ice-cavern there. I slept With hairy men, or monsters slew, Or led down misty seas my crew Of cruel savages and slaves, And slew who dared the distant waves, And once a strange, strong ship—and she, I bore her to yon cave of ice,— And Love companioned me. VII “Two scenes of all scenes from the first Have come to me on this great sea: The one when light from heaven burst, The one when sweet Love came to me. And of the two, or best or worst, I ever hold this second first, Bear with me. Yonder citadel Of ice tells all my tongue can tell: My thirst for love, my pain, my pride, My soul's warm youth the while she lived, Its old age when she died. “I know not if she loved or no. I only asked to serve and love; To love and serve, and ever so My love grew as grows light above,— Grew from gray dawn to gold midday, And swept the wide world in its sway. The stars came down, so close they came, I called them, named them with her name, The kind moon came,—came once so near, That in the hollow of her arm I leaned my lifted spear. “And yet, somehow, for all the stars, And all the silver of the moon, She looked from out her icy bars As longing for some sultry noon; As longing for some warmer kind, Some far south sunland left behind. Then I went down to sea. I sailed Thro' seas where monstrous beasts prevailed, Such slimy, shapeless, hungered things! Red griffins, wide-winged, bat-like wings, Black griffins, black or fire-fed, That ate my fever-stricken men Ere yet they were quite dead. “I could not find her love for her, Or land, or fit thing for her touch, And I came back, sad worshiper, And watched and longed and loved so much! I watched huge monsters climb and pass Reflected in great walls, like glass; Dark, draggled, hairy, fearful forms Upblown by ever-battling storms, And streaming still with slime and spray; So huge from out their sultry seas, Like storm-torn islands they. “Then even these she ceased to note, She ceased at last to look on me, But, baring to the sun her throat, She looked and looked incessantly Away against the south, away Against the sun the livelong day. At last I saw her watch the swan Surge tow'rd the north, surge on and on. I saw her smile, her first, faint smile; Then burst a new-born thought, and I, I nursed that all the while. VIII “I somehow dreamed, or guessed, or knew That somewhere in the dear earth's heart Was warmth and tenderness and true Delight, and all love's nobler part. I tried to think, aye, thought and thought; In all the strange fruits that I brought For her delight I could but find The sweetness deep within the rind. All beasts, all birds, some better part Of central being deepest housed; And earth must have a heart. “I watched the wide-winged birds that blew Continually against the bleak And ice-built north, and surely knew The long, lorn croak, the reaching beak, Led not to ruin evermore; For they came back, came swooping o'er Each spring, with clouds of younger ones, So dense, they dimmed the summer suns. And thus I knew somehow, somewhere, Beyond earth's ice-built, star-tipt peaks They found a softer air. “And too, I heard strange stories, held In memories of my hairy men, Vague, dim traditions, dim with eld, Of other lands and ages when Nor ices were, nor anything; But ever one warm, restful spring Of radiant sunlight: stories told By dauntless men of giant mold, Who kept their cavern's icy mouth Ice-locked, and hungered where they sat, With sad eyes tow'rd the south: “Tales of a time ere hate began, Of herds of reindeer, wild beasts tamed, When man walked forth in love with man, Walked naked, and was not ashamed; Of how a brother beast he slew, Then night, and all sad sorrows knew; How tame beasts were no longer tame; How God drew His great sword of flame And drove man naked to the snow, Till, pitying, He made of skins A coat, and clothed him so. “And, true or not true, still the same, I saw continually at night That far, bright, flashing sword of flame, Misnamed the Borealis light; I saw my men, in coats of skin As God had clothed them, felt the sin And suffering of that first death Each day in every icy breath. Then why should I still disbelieve These tales of fairer lands than mine, And let my lady grieve? IX “Yea, I would find that land for her! Then dogs, and sleds, and swift reindeer; Huge, hairy men, all mailed in fur, Who knew not yet the name of fear, Nor knew fatigue, nor aught that ever To this day has balked endeavor. And we swept forth, while wide, swift wings Still sought the Pole in endless strings. I left her sitting looking south, Still leaning, looking to the sun,— My kisses on her mouth! X “Far toward the north, so tall, so far, One tallest ice shaft starward stood— Stood as if 'twere itself a star, Scarce fallen from its sisterhood. Tip-top the glowing apex there Upreared a huge white polar bear; He pushed his swart nose up and out, Then walked the North Star round about, Below the Great Bear of the main, The upper main, and as if chained, Chained with a star-linked chain. XI “And we pushed on, up, on, and on, Until, as in the world of dreams, We found the very doors of dawn With warm sun bursting through the seams. We brake them through, then down, far down, Until, as in some park-set town, We found lost Eden. Very rare The fruit, and all the perfumed air So sweet, we sat us down to feed And rest, without a thought or care, Or ever other need. “For all earth's pretty birds were here; And women fair, and very fair; Sweet song was in the atmosphere, Nor effort was, nor noise, nor care. As cocoons from their silken house Wing forth and in the sun carouse, My men let fall their housings and Passed on and on, far down the land Of purple grapes and poppy bloom. Such warm, sweet land, such peaceful land! Sweet peace and sweet perfume! “And I pushed down ere I returned To climb the cold world's walls of snow, And saw where earth's heart beat and burned, An hundred sultry leagues below; Saw deep seas set with deep-sea isles Of waving verdure; miles on miles Of rising sea-birds with their broods, In all their noisy, happy moods! Aye, then I knew earth has a heart, That Nature wastes nor space or place, But husbands every part. XII “My reindeer fretted: I turned back For her, the heart of me, my soul! Ah, then, how swift, how white my track! All Paradise beneath the Pole Were but a mockery till she Should share its dreamful sweets with me. I know not well what next befell, Save that white heaven grew black hell. She sat with sad face to the south, Still sat, sat still; but she was dead— My kisses on her mouth. XIII “What else to do but droop and die? But dying, how my poor soul yearned To fly as swift south birds may fly— To pass that way her eyes had turned, The dear days she had sat with me, And search and search eternity! And, do you know, I surely know That God has given us to go The way we will in life or death— To go, to grow, or good or ill, As one may draw a breath?” PART FOURTH I Nay, turn not to the past for light; Nay, teach not Pagan tale forsooth! Behind lie heathen gods and night, Before lifts high, white holy truth. Sweet Orpheus looked back, and lo, Hell met his eyes and endless woe! Lot's wife looked back, and for this fell To something even worse than hell. Let us have faith, sail, seek and find The new world and the new world's ways: Blind Homer led the blind! II Come, let us kindle Faith in light! Yon eagle climbing to the sun Keeps not the straightest course in sight, But room and reach of wing and run Of rounding circle all are his, Till he at last bathes in the light Of worlds that look far down on this Arena's battle for the right. The stoutest sail that braves the breeze, The bravest battle ship that rides, Rides rounding up the seas. Come, let us kindle faith in man! What though yon eagle, where he swings, May moult a feather in God's plan Of broader, stronger, better wings! Why, let the moulted feathers lie As thick as leaves upon the lawn: These be but proof we cleave the sky And still round on and on and on. Fear not for moulting feathers; nay, But rather fear when all seems fair, And care is far away. Come, let us kindle faith in God! He made, He kept, He still can keep. The storm obeys His burning rod, The storm brought Christ to walk the deep. Trust God to round His own at will; Trust God to keep His own for aye— Or strife or strike, or well or ill; An eagle climbing up the sky— A meteor down from heaven hurled— Trust God to round, reform, or rock His new-born baby world. III How full the great, full-hearted seas That lave high, white Alaska's feet! How densely green the dense green trees! How sweet the smell of wood! how sweet! What sense of high, white newness where This new world breathes the new, blue air That never breath of man or breath Of mortal thing considereth! And O, that Borealis light! The angel with his flaming sword And never sense of night! IV Are these the walls of Paradise— Yon peaks the gates man may not pass? Lo, everlasting silence lies Along their gleaming ways of glass! Just silence and that sword of flame; Just silence and Jehovah's name, Where all is new, unnamed, and white! Come, let us read where angels write— “In the beginning God”—aye, these The waters where God's Spirit moved; These, these, the very seas! Just one deep, wave-washed chariot wheel Such sunset as that far first day! An unsheathed sword of flame and steel; Then battle flashes; then dismay, And mad confusion of all hues That earth and heaven could infuse, Till all hues softly fused and blent In orange worlds of wonderment: Then dying day, in kingly ire, Struck back with one last blow, and smote The world with him molten fire. So fell Alaska, proudly, dead In battle harness where he fought. But falling, still high o'er his head Far flashed his sword in crimson wrought, Till came his kingly foeman, Dusk, In garments moist with smell of musk. The bent moon moved down heaven's steeps Low-bowed, as when a woman weeps; Bowed low, half-veiled in widowhood; Then stars tiptoed the peaks in gold And burned brown sandal-wood. Fit death of Day; fit burial rite Of white Alaska! Let us lay This leaflet 'mid the musky night Upon his tomb. Come, come away; For Phaon talks and Sappho turns To where the light of heaven burns To love light, and she leans to hear With something more than mortal ear. The while the ship has pushed her prow So close against the fir-set shore You breathe the spicy bough. V Some red men by the low, white beach; Camp fires, belts of dense, black fir: She leans as if she still would reach To him the very soul of her. The red flames cast a silhouette Against the snow, above the jet Black, narrow night of fragrant fir, Behold, what ardent worshiper! Lim'd out against a glacier peak, With strong arms crossed upon his breast; The while she feels him speak: “How glad was I to walk with Death Far down his dim, still, trackless lands, Where wind nor wave nor any breath Broke ripples o'er the somber sands. I walked with Death as eagerly As ever I had sailed this sea. Then on and on I searched, I sought, Yet all my seeking came to naught. I sailed by pleasant, peopled isles Of song and summer time; I sailed Ten thousand weary miles! “I heard a song! She had been sad, So sad and ever drooping she; How could she, then, in song be glad The while I searched? It could not be. And yet that voice! so like it seemed, I questioned if I heard or dreamed. She smiled on me. This made me scorn My very self; for I was born To loyalty. I would be true Unto my love, my soul, my self, Whatever death might do. “I fled her face, her proud, fair face, Her songs that won a world to her. Had she sat songless in her place, Sat with no single worshiper, Sat with bowed head, sad-voiced, alone, I might have known! I might have known! But how could I, the savage, know This sun, contrasting with that snow, Would waken her great soul to song That still thrills all the ages through? I blindly did such wrong! “Again I fled. I ferried gods; Yet, pining still, I came to pine Where drowsy Lesbos Bacchus nods And drowned my soul in Cyprian wine. Drowned! drowned my poor, sad soul so deep, I sank to where damned serpents creep! Then slowly upward; round by round I toiled, regained this vantage-ground. And now, at last, I claim mine own, As some long-banished king comes back To battle for his throne.” VI I do not say that thus he spake By word of mouth, by human speech; The sun in one swift flash will take A photograph of space and reach The realm of stars. A soul like his Is like unto the sun in this: Her soul the plate placed to receive The swift impressions, to believe, To doubt no more than you might doubt The wondrous midnight world of stars That dawn has blotted out. VII And Phaon loved her; he who knew The North Pole and the South, who named The stars for her, strode forth and slew Black, hairy monsters no man tamed; And all before fair Greece was born, Or Lesbos yet knew night or morn. No marvel that she knew him when He came, the chiefest of all men. No marvel that she loved and died, And left such marbled bits of song— Of broken Phidian pride. VIII Oh, but for that one further sense For man that man shall yet possess! That sense that puts aside pretense And sees the truth, that scorns to guess Or grope, or play at blindman's buff, But knows rough diamonds in the rough! Oh, well for man when man shall see, As see he must man's destiny! Oh, well when man shall know his mate, One-winged and desolate, lives on And bravely dares to wait! IX Full morning found them, and the land Received them, and the chapel gray; Some Indian huts on either hand, A smell of pine, a flash of spray,— White, frozen rivers of the sky Far up the glacial steeps hard by. Far ice-peaks flashed with sudden light, As if they would illume the rite, As if they knew his story well, As if they knew that form, that face, And all that Time could tell. X They passed dusk chieftans two by two, With totem gods and stroud and shell They slowly passed, and passing through, He bought of all—he knew them well. And one, a bent old man and blind, He put his hands about, and kind And strange words whispered in his ear, So soft, his dull soul could but hear. And hear he surely did, for he, With full hands, lifted up his face And smiled right pleasantly. How near, how far, how fierce, how tame! The polar bear, the olive branch; The dying exile, Christ's sweet name— Vast silence! then the avalanche! How much this little church to them— Alaska and Jerusalem! The pair passed in, the silent pair Fell down before the altar there, The Greek before the gray Greek cross, And Phaon at her side at last, For all her weary loss. The bearded priest came, and he laid His two hands forth and slowly spake Strange, solemn words, and slowly prayed, And blessed them there, for Jesus' sake. Then slowly they arose and passed, Still silent, voiceless to the last. They passed: her eyes were to his eyes, But his were lifted to the skies, As looking, looking, that lorn night, Before the birth of God's first-born As praying still for Light. XI So Phaon knew and Sappho knew Nor night nor sadness any more. . . . How new the old world, ever new, When white Love walks the shining shore! They found their long-lost Eden, found Her old, sweet songs; such dulcet sound Of harmonies as soothe the ear When Love and only Love can hear. They found lost Eden; lilies lay Along their path, whichever land They journeyed from that day. XII They never died. Great loves live on. You need not die and dare the skies In forms that poor creeds hinge upon To pass the gates of Paradise. I know not if that sword of flame Still lights the North, and leads the same As when he passed the gates of old. I know not if they braved the bold, Defiant walls that fronted them Where awful Saint Elias broods, Wrapped in God's garment-hem. I only know they found the lost, The long-lost Eden, found all fair Where naught had been but hail and frost; As Love finds Eden anywhere. And wouldst thou, too, live on and on? Then walk with Nature till the dawn. Aye, make thy soul worth saving—save Thy soul from darkness and the grave. Love God not overmuch, but love God's world which He called very good; Then lo, Love's white sea-dove! XIII I know not where lies Eden-land; I only know 't is like unto God's kingdom, ever right at hand— Ever right here in reach of you. Put forth thy hand, or great or small, In storm or sun, by sea or wood, And say, as God hath said of all, Behold, it all is very good. I know not where lies Eden-land; I only say receive the dove: I say put forth thy hand. ADIOS And here, sweet friend, I go my way Alone, as I have lived, alone A little way, a brief half day, And then, the restful, white milestone. I know not surely where or when, But surely know we meet again, As surely know we love anew In grander life the good and true. But why assume to guide or guess? Behold our stars are shepherded— Madonna, Shepherdess. Enough to know that I and you Shall breathe together there as here Some clearer, sweeter atmosphere: Shall walk high, wider ways above Our petty selves, shall lean to lead Man up and up in thought and deed. . . . Dear soul, sweet friend, I love you, love The love that led you patient through This wilderness of words in quest Of strange wild flowers from my West; But here, dear heart, Adieu. I Yon great chained sea-ship chafes to be Once more unleased without the Gate On proud Balboa's boundless sea, And I chafe with her, for I hate The rust of rest, the dull repose, The fawning breath of changeful foes, Whose blame through all my bitter days I have endured; spare me their praise! I go, full hearted, grateful, glad Of strength from dear good mother earth; And yet am I full sad. II Could I but teach man to believe— Could I but make small men to grow, To break frail spider-webs that weave About their thews and bind them low; Could I but sing one song and slay Grim Doubt; I then could go my way In tranquil silence, glad, serene, And satisfied, from off the scene. But ah, this disbelief, this doubt, This doubt of God, this doubt of good,— The damned spot will not out! III Grew once a rose within my room Of perfect hue, of perfect health; Of such perfection and perfume, It filled my poor house with its wealth. Then came the pessimist who knew Not good or grace, but overthrew My rose, and in the broken pot Nosed fast for slugs within the rot. He found, found with exulting pride,— A baby butterfly it was; The while my rose-tree died. IV Yea, he did hurt me. Joy in this. Receive great joy at last to know, Since pain is all your world of bliss, That ye did, hounding, hurt me so! But mute as bayed stag on his steeps, Who keeps his haunts, and, bleeding, keeps His breast turned, watching where they come, Kept I, defiant, and as dumb. But comfort ye; your work was done With devils' cunning, like the mole That lets the life-sap run. And my revenge? My vengeance is That I have made one rugged spot The fairer; that I fashioned this While envy, hate, and falsehood shot Rank poison; that I leave to those Who shot, for arrows, each a rose; Aye, labyrinths of rose and wold, Acacias garmented in gold, Bright fountains, where birds come to drink; Such clouds of cunning, pretty birds, And tame as you can think. V Come here when I am far away, Fond lovers of this lovely land, And sit quite still and do not say, Turn right or left, or lift a hand, But sit beneath my kindly trees And gaze far out yon sea of seas:— These trees, these very stones, could tell How long I loved them, and how well— And maybe I shall come and sit Beside you; sit so silently You will not reck of it. VI The old desire of far, new lands, The thirst to learn, to still front storms, To bend my knees, to lift my hands To God in all His thousand forms— These lure and lead as pleasantly As old songs sung anew at sea. But, storied lands or stormy deeps, I will my ashes to my steeps— I will my steeps, green cross, red rose, To those who love the beautiful— Come, learn to be of those. VII The sun has draped his couch in red; Night takes the warm world in his arms And turns to their espousal bed To breathe the perfume of her charms: The great sea calls, and I descend As to the call of some strong friend. I go, not hating any man, But loving Earth as only can A lover suckled at her breast Of beauty from his babyhood, And roam to truly rest. VIII God is not far; man is not far From Heaven's porch, where pæans roll. Man yet shall speak from star to star In silent language of the soul; Yon star-strewn skies be but a town, With angels passing up and down. “I leave my peace with you.” Lo! these His seven wounds, the Pleiades Pierce Heaven's porch. But, resting there, The new moon rocks the Child Christ in Her silver rocking-chair. HINTS FROM THE HIGHTS And oh, the voices! I have heard! Such visions where the morning grows— A brother's soul in some sweet bird, A sister's spirit in a rose. And oh, the beauty I have found! Such beauty, beauty everywhere; The beauty creeping on the ground, The beauty singing through the air. The love in all, the good, the worth, The God in all, or dusk or dawn; Good will to man and peace on earth; The morning stars sing on and on.</field>
