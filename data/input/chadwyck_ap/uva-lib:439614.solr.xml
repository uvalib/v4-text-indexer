      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME I. DEMETRIA, A TRAGEDY IN FIVE ACTS. Demetria was written before the author was sufficiently practised, to express his thoughts in verse with simplicity; though not before the heart has usually taken in a tolerable freight of the passions to which it relates. Its imperfections were soon apparent, and it was laid aside for revision; but, other themes and other affairs engaging his attention, it was left untouched till the summer of 1837. Having at that time reached a piece of level ground in the journey of life, and feeling an impulse to an old amusement, the task of re-writing this Tragedy, several times meditated and postponed, was taken in hand. A pleasure attended the labor, perhaps equal to that of inventing new scenes. For, when the writer, after an interval of twenty-six years, found himself employed, once more, over its remembered pages, an illusion restored, as it were, life's early fragrance, brought back the lumen purpureum, seldom adequately prized till its tint begins to fade. The structure and complexion of the original have been studiously preserved. The reader will not fail to perceive that it was not the design to produce a stately poem, but a domestic Tragedy as simple in diction as in plan. DRAMATIS PERSONÃ. Count Amerigo. Cosmo, his nephew. Orsini, friend of Cosmo. Barbadeca. Cavaliers, ladies, &amp;c. Olivia, daughter of the Count. Demetria, daughter of the Count. Jacquelina, Olivia's woman. Bianca, an old domestic. SCENE. BelvederÃ©, the family seat, on the Arno, a few leagues from Florence. ACT I. SCENE I. An apartment communicating with the garden: glass doors thrown open in the moonlight: Cosmo and Demetria. Cos. Now, as thou sit'st, absorbed and motionless, Checkered with silvery gleams and quivering shadows, Thou look'st some pale, fair statue garlanded, Some Nymph, or Muse, such as the old Greek herdsmen Imagined haunting round their wood-girt temples! Or, if a nun-like fancy please thee better, One of the choir, (as holy legends have it,) Heard tuning their clear strings and glancing viols In the blue depths of such a night as this!â Nor word? nor smile?âI'll improvise no more.â Sure, never goddess lovelier, or more mute, Drew homage to her pedestal. Dem. O, Cosmo, This is a sacred anniversary, An ever-hallowed season, when my heart Is busy with the past; and thy return But freshens sad remembrance. Cos. Think me not Incapable of sympathy.âThou know'st How dear I loved her.âBut to be, once more, At BelvederÃ© turns me to a prattler. Dem. Hither we came, that last sad night, to breathe The freshness. There she sat.âI see, still see The pale light on her cheek, and in her eyes The fatal brightness! O, could I recount Her thoughtsâanticipationsâretrospects!â The treasury of past years, our happy years, Was opened,âwhen no parting e'er was thought on;â When thou wert here, and dwelt as one of us. Remind him (so she said) of my fond love, And bid him be a brother to my orphans. Cos. (snatching her hand.) Then hear, Demetriaâ Dem. Not on this vigil,â 'T is hers,â't is consecrated solemnly,â And images of grief are up before me. I joy that thou art here, at last; yet O! What a drear interval!âWhile she remained, Sweet sympathy was left; but when she parted, My broken heart went with her to the tomb. For, Cosmo, I despairedâever to meet thee, So lengthened and so dismal seemed the time.â Cos. But now, my gentle one, the dark dream 's o'er: We wake, we wake, to blissful certainty. Dwell, now, on brighter days,âon the fair future,â And deem the sainted parent we adore Looks down with blessings and approval. Dem. Ah! She promisedâsometimes to be near me,âoft To hover round me,âif such favor might be. (A lively measure strikes up beyond the garden wall. Cos. Savoyards!âO! the jocund strain Chimes here; but o'er the wild Hungarian hills, When years divided me from Italy, Beshrew the rogues! they minted from me tears As fast as florins.âMerry vagabonds!â Come,âshall we list their lays?âor whither wilt thou?â Come forth awhile; for like familiar faces The slopes and shadows of the garden look;â Heavenly, to me, after my weary exile! How oft, by night, by day, has this dear scene Stood in my fancy visible as now!â Let us revisit the old myrtle walk:â Rememberest thou our last hour there?âCome, come, We sin against the heavens to be in doors. (They pass into the garden.) SCENE II. Olivia's bed-chamber, in a wing of the villa overlooking the garden. Olivia and Jacquelina. Oliv. I'm sated,âweary of it. Jacq. But why, my lady? Oliv. No matter. Jacq. Nay, Signora, Were a poor serving-woman, worse endowed Than our great grandam,âtied to these two pouches Empty, (thrusting her hands into her pockets,)âan evil past the primitive,â Were she to rail against the niggard world, There might be reason. But to hear youth, beauty, Fortune, and noblenessâ Oliv. O, fool me not;â Thou know'st, before I speak, the thorn that pricks me,â Thou seest her like an adder in my path,â Perceivest me slightedâlike a dwarfish cluster,â While all are scrambling for the prize that gilds Her branch. No moment of my life is sweet Or comfortable. Deep, and ever rankling, I bear a gangrene that corrodes to death. Jacq. You wrong your beauty, trifle with your peace.â Oliv. Wrong?âWho that is not macerated, dead To all that agitates the soul of woman, Could choose but feel?âand bitterly resent?â Precedence is my rightâinalienableâ Yet when was not Olivia's favor blanked At her appearing?âHalf the natural love My parents owed me she purloined. I pined The loss, to be rebuked for sullenness. Up from our childhood,âif my shape, or bloom, Dark curls, or glances, aught about me drew A breath of praise,âanon, I hear of eyes That witch, as doth the pale green evening sky; Cheeks, like the rose-tipt glacier; yellow locks, That make the dreamer murmur of Madonna! Ever, for her, the proudest breathed the sigh; Round her, Love anticked as a new-found Psyche, While scarce an eye seemed conscious of Olivia. Jacq. Preposterous! had it been so, dearest lady. Oliv. But this I 've borne, if not with meekness, borne In bitter silence. I 've adorned her train, Served as her foil, endured from youth neglects I can endure no longer. Mark meâBut first, Hast thou observed this Cosmo? Jacq. Yes, my lady. Oliv. I mean, hast thou perused him heedfully? Jacq. Enough to see a model for a sculptor. Oliv. Hark, girl,âI'll tell thee. Some ten years ago, Being bereft, at once, of both his parents, My father brought him here to BelvederÃ©.â I, from the first, laid claim to him, and vowed, By all the powers of love, to make him mine. Just in his opening flower it was, he came,â Graceful and blooming as a Ganymede; Mixed fire and sweetness darting from his eyes, Even in grief, infection to the heart. O, that his lineaments could rise before thee In all the unsunned beauty of the stripling! Jacq. Gramercy! I prefer the sun-burnt man. Clip his moustache, give him the Phrygian cap, And he might stand, now, for the rogue of Ida. Oliv. But here, as ever, stepped the basilisk 'Twixt me and happiness. Too soon I found My pittance was the poor regard that lives For kindred. But when his sidelong glance met hers, There flashed from it another tale. I raised Some jealousies,âand accidents conspired,â That kept them from an open declaration Till he departed for the wars. Alone, She withered like a stemless blossom, long Deluding me with mournful expectations. But six full years are wasted, yet she lives, She blooms, as in a second May. And Cosmoâ Marked'st thou?âha?âat the table,âdidst thou read The language of his eyes? Jacq. Truly, Signora, I could not but perceive, or fail to note, While he recounted his young soldiership, Another pair, like blue bells after rain. Oliv. Witch! sorceress! would that her tears might blind her! Ah! Jacquelina!â't is too palpableâ Jacq. (perceiving from the window.) Ha! apropos! (Aside.) Be not too hasty: silently observe How things fall out a day or two: as yet, The storm of welcomes and God-bless-ye's scarce Is over. Joy and revel rule the house:â The very serving-men and grooms are crazed. Soon as this tipsy mood subsidesâ(Seems to start.) Oliv. What 's there? Jacq. Ha!âcan it be!âfaith! evenâhere, my lady, Stand hereâSeest thou?âunder that pomegranate? Oliv. Confusion! Cosmo and Demetria! Jacq. Troth, Almost embracing. Oliv. Put away the light. (Jacquelina extinguishes the lamp: Olivia leans from the window.) Jacq. (in a whisper, after listening some time.) Hear'st thou? Oliv. Dost thou? Jacq. Nothing intelligible. Oliv. Mark! mark!âWhat means that gesture? Jacq. Lo! againâ To ratify some vow, or protestation,â Look, how his amorous plume bows towards her cheek, And dallies, as to kiss her with the breeze. Oliv. (stepping back.) They move this way.âWatch where they go. (A door closes.) Jacq. Into the hall. That was the glass door closing. Oliv. Her wittol father hears this! By the mass! Arcadian times again!âHow know weâha? What gambols grots and garden nooks may witness? O! chaste, thrice pure, most pale-faced, snowy vestal! Could some, whom you feigned marble to, see this! Clinging, and palming it! Jacq. Will you consent to be thus outmanÅuvred? For, now, we need no confirmation. Oliv. No,â Never,âby all my injuries,âI would not,â But where 's the remedy? Jacq. Ha! ha! Methinks 't would need no miracle,âno magic,â Nothing transcending mother wit. Oliv. I'll hail Ingots upon thee, jewels as the wind Showers winter crystals! O! unlock thy brain,â Devise, forge, conjure for me!âBut no risks,â No gossip,âjeopard not my pride or honor. Jacq. When your grandfather, or your great uncle, (Which was it?) risked the main untraversed ocean, Struggled against despair and mutiny, Ate mouldy biscuit, drank sea-water, knew No more than ignorance, whether his loved home Should greet him more, or he englut some monster, Pray wherefore did he jeopard thus?âFor nothing, But leave to stamp on the chartâAmerigo. And shall the lover's meed, so coveted, That, oft, the lack frenzies and drives men mad, Be plucked with less smart than a gooseberry?â What! for the tinkle of an idle tongue Forego the object of sighs infinite, Salt tears to drown ye, which has kept your eyes Unvisited of rest, poisoned your heart With jealous rancors, mildewed all life's sweetness, Made youth itself one canker,âsaint-like sit, And see 't inveigled from you!âVirgin martyrs! In Venice you 'd be sung in hymns; held up In holy pulpits as the child of Job; Invoked, as one by patience sanctified!â O yesâI 've lived there:âdid I ever tell theeâ I mean a storyârife when I was there,â How a Venetian served her rival? Oliv. Never. Jacq. A noble lady, called Florentia, loved The counterpart of this same Cosmo. She, Like you, had been his playmate, and imbibed Passionate thoughts, early and unawares, Till all her being centred in one hope.â It chanced, once, with her lover and her father, She visited their old ancestral castle, Built in the mountains, built for war and strength, A huge grey mass of towers and battlements, Lonely and frowning 'midst its solemn woods. Here they amused some sultry summer days With roaming through the strange, gigantic pile; Reminded by its massiveness of times When the fierce Condottieri made the hills Flash with their arms, and echo with their music. A few sweet days flew o'er their solitude, When (as to mar their Paradise) her sister,â Adopted by some kinswoman, some countess, And reared by her from early youth,âthis sisterâ I say her younger sisterâfollowed her. Oliv. What, to the castle? Jacq. Ay, as if resolved Maliciously to rob her of her birthright. Florentia welcomed her as might beseem Her father's child. But, soon, this young one,âmark,â This cunning piece of fascination threw Her witch-nets round her sister's plighted lover,â She stole his heart,âmost treacherously robbed Her elder sister,âtriumphed in the deed. When proud Florentia saw the truth, a pang Convulsed her like an epilepsy; her eye Shot one Vesuvian glare,âand all was calm, Or seemed so. Thereupon, one listless day, When both the cavaliers were down the mountains Riding or hunting, she began to speak Of sundry strange and secret passages, And labyrinths of cells, like catacombs, Cut in the living rock beneath the castle, For safety or concealment; vaults, and crypts, Receptacles of treasure or of groans. In one, she said, some hundred fathom down, The bandit Leo Galfri breathed his last, Chained to a ring still there. And in another Three chests, with mighty clasps of iron, stood, That looked like treasure-chests, but which her father Refused to open. Piquing thus, awhile, Her curiosity, she cried, at last, âLauretta, come, I long to know their contents; Let 's go and privately examine them.â Purloining keys and lights, they went together, Down, down, long winding damp stone stairs,âthrough this And that dark vault, low passage, massive door, Such as we hear of,âtill they came indeed, Far down, into an arched room, prison-like, Ribbed with such monstrous stones as might have borne The whole incumbent pile. There stood the chests. Oliv. Three, saidst thou? Jacq. Three prodigious chests.â Pausing to gather nerve and breath, they strove To open one; but could not, for a spring. This mastered, their united strength heaved up The bossy, clasped, and antique lid. Oliv. What saw they? Jacq. Parchment rolls, with papal seals, And piles of old discolored writings. Oliv. Nought else? Jacq. O, yes; among the papers lay a casket, Inlaid with brass or gold, or some bright substance. In haste to seize it (for the chest was deep), Lauretta climbed, and, reaching, lost her balance, And fell sheer in.âDown comes the heavy lid; The steel spring snaps; the rusty dungeon key Does its last office; brave Florentia lies Slumbering upon her bed, and, waking, asks Whether Lauretta is returned from rambling. Oliv. O, heavens and earth! She did not perish there? Jacq. Her father, sister, all the house wore black, Whether she did or no;âand every hold And fastness of the mountains was smoked out, And nineteen brigands and their leader suffered. I cannot say she perished there, when those Same rogues strangled her as was proved, and swung To expiate their crime. Oliv. A dreadful story! Jacq. I could unfold you many such. Her treachery deserved scarce better. False Insinuating minion! Oliv. (in a low, hesitating voice.) Surely,âthou canst not meanâ Jacq. Mean what, Signora? Oliv. That Iâthat weâ Jacq. Speak out, dear injured lady.âWhat So moves thee?âSpeak!âNay, trust me not by halves. Oliv. What meant'st thou by that tale? Jacq. To show you, lady, How proud souls can resolve, when basely wronged. Oliv. Then I must bear it? Jacq. Better so, Than conscience should begnaw your life. And yetâ Discard him,âtear his image from your breast And cast it to the winds. Arm your keen eye With coldness and disdain, and see these turtles Bill at the altar. Oliv. Sooner come perdition! Jacq. Then quickly meditate some bold resolve. Fortune and rank achieved, or fallen on him, Who can gainsay his suit?âHis doating uncle?â It needs but half an eye to see they love.â Fate only, or some master-stroke, can stop Their marriage. Oliv. Accursed truth!âBut whatâwhat stroke?â What fate? Jacq. Some casualty, or providence, Agent, or anodyne, stronger than love. Oliv. (in a hollow voice.) O, Jacquelinaâfriendâ Jacq. Command me, dearest mistress. Oliv. Ifâifâ Jacq. What says my lady?âNo eavesdropper 's near us. Oliv. (hurriedly.) No tower is here,âno prison,âsafe, dark, deep,â No fatal instrument,âand ah! I fear, Scarce provocation to excuse like hers. Jacq. Holy Maria keep Sathanas from us! What art thou ruminating? Oliv. Hush!âspeak lower;â Methought you saidâmethought you whispered me With abjectness of mindâwith tame enduranceâ But I'm scarce waking.âDismal, dreamlike things Flit through my fancy. I'll to bed. Shut, shut. (Jacquelina closes the sash.) Would we 'd a light:âthe chamber 's like a tomb. Goâno; stayâleave me not. You might disturb My father or some other. I'll undress, For this time, as I may.âMake haste, I say.â Can I have caught an ague? (Jacquelina begins to undress Olivia, but stops, as in thought.) Jacq. What ifâSignoraâCould we not Accomplish itâsomehowâby stratagem? (Olivia turns quickly.) Let 's see.âBut lateâwithin this very monthâ Your sister contumeliously dismissed A wooer, whom we all know something of; Haughty, unscrupulous, but of a face And mien to hit fastidious eyes. He 's now Moody with disappointment, apt for mischiefâ Oliv. Well; Barbadeca. Jacq. And to a wish, Cosmo and he are still at daggers' pointsâ Oliv. What then? 'T were death, ifâ Jacq. I know it: hear me, lady.â Some quarrel in the service long ago, Some bagatelle, I know not what, unsheathed Their angry weapons. Cosmo twice disarmed him; Coupling the second gift of life with terms, That, chafing his imperious spirit, bred A rancorous hate. This, Cosmo wots full well. And Barbadeca, while he wooed your sister, (Before her saint-ship turned poor me adrift,) Confided gifts and letters to my care, Communed with me in private of his love, Lamenting that a rival he abhorred Should triumph o'er him. Somewhere he had caught A rumor of their early passion. Now,â The Count, you know, looked coldly on his suit As well as she,ânow, of these circumstances Could we not weave the several ends together, Blending, transposing, and so coloring things, That Cosmo (prone to sudden jealousy) Should think his mistress, to gain time and slip Peaceably the knot of her old vows, dissembled; Though secretly grown fond of Barbadeca?â Might not these hints be wrought? Oliv. 'T would strain his weakness:â Credulity 's his vice. Jacq. And all his rare And noble qualities he rates so cheap, That confidence would fail him, if a hair Fell in love's scale opposed to his deserts.â Oliv. YetâyetâI dread her art: she can put on Looks so angelical, so meek, so pure,â The thing were perilous. Jacq. Not so to you;â You need not move in it:âon me alone Falls all the shame, which I will bear, And more, for your dear sake. Oliv. How, if their love, this night Confessed and ratifiedâ Jacq. Even that may seem Forced on her for a while to skreen her secret; Or charged on Barbadeca's malice. Oliv. That, indeed. Jacq. Besides, strong probability sides with us:â Timeâopportunityâour fickle natureâ The known caprices of our sexâLord! Lord! To dwell upon a shadow six long years! Six slow-revolving, dull-returning winters To nourish and keep warm a lifeless image!â Love and Disdain might breed, and die, revive, And chase, and eat each other in less time. Sly Ariosto fables this too shrewdly With his two fountains. Oliv. No more to-night. I'll think of it.âWhat 's that? Jacq. Only the tree rustling against the window. But why mope here, Signora, when the moon Is queening 't over wood and river?âCome; Let 's to your closet. In the cheerful beam Of that bright window, I 've another thought Better unfolded ere to-morrow.âCome. (Exeunt.) ACT II. SCENE I. A wood in the pleasure grounds. Jacquelina near a hollow tree, overhanging the path: she walks restlessly to and fro. Jacq. Where can he loiter?âTime and place Were both so iterated!âFools never comprehend What minutes are in fate's machineryâ (Enter Barbadeca, looking cautiously round.) Barb. So, Jacquelina, Jacquelina! Jacq. (springing forward.) Has Cosmo seen thee? Barb. No. Jacq. Where 's the envelope? Barb. Here. (Producing a paper.) Jacq. Her hand!âNow mark. (Taking a letter from her bosom.) This scrap I picked from out her private papers;â One of her scores of tender notes to Cosmo;â Hundreds she penned, seen only by herself. Its drift suits well,âlove-breathing words, Without direction, date, or name. This,âmark ye,â Lodged in the cover of the cruel lines That sent you crest-fallen home, converts Into a honeyed billet to yourself; Past human eyes, her own even, to deny. Barb. What then? Jacq. Observe.âCosmo will presently pass by; Nay, at this moment is not farther from us Than the green knoll under the old beech yonder. Now, as you wish success in your heart's cause, Cross him. At first, seem rapt in meditation,â Stalk by him thusâas though you saw him not,â After, descry him suddenly,âstart back, And disappear as though you shunn'd him. Barb. But wherefore? Jacq. Hereafter you shall know. Goâpritheeâgo!â So far you 've trusted me. Barb. Well, well,âwhich way? Jacq. Keep toward the river, just within the trees, Till you perceive him;âthen as I direct. (Exit Barbadeca.) So far we thrive!âIt falls out to a wish!â Prove he but rash and jealous to my hope, The mesh is fatal. Other cares, pale beauty, We'll furnish thee withal, than rating me Because I chide a beggar from the gate. How keen Olivia 's on the scent! No need Of art, and cunning practice, to wind up Sheer self-idolatry. True as the needle To one dear influence, all besides is nothing. If but her dastard natureâSoft! he comes. (Cosmo seen approaching. She hastily opens the letter, and, leaning against the tree, seems buried in thought: as he passes, she starts violently.) Good heavens! he 's here! Cos. (stopping.) Why start ye? Jacq. Start, my lord? Cos. Ay, start; as if you feared to see me? Jacq. Feared to see you, Signor? Cos. (approaching her.) What paper 's that you crush together so?â Nay, draw not back. You tremble too. Jacq. My lord, I know of nought to tremble at. Cos. What paper 's that? Jacq. This paper? Cos. Ay, that paper, girl? Concerns it me? Jacq. You, my lord? Cos. Else, why that start? And seeing me, cry âHeavens! he 's here!â Is 't more For me to ramble this way than another? Jacq. I knew not that I did. Cos. You thrust it in your bosom, too,âlo! lo!â So fearful eagerâCome, I'll see it. Jacq. Nayâ Indeedâbeseech ye, think notâForce me notâ Think on 't no moreâfor your own peace. Cos. (startled.) Ha! Jacq. Alas! what have I said? Cos. Give me the paper. Jacq. Indeed, my lordâ Cos. No wordsâThe paper. Jacq. My lord, indeedâBe ruledâupon my lifeâ Cos. (seizing, and unfolding the letter.) To Barbadeca!â Demetria's hand!â(Reads.) Jacq. O, shake not thus,â It cannot beâupon my soul it cannotâ Cos. Death!âwhere got you this? Jacq. Indeed, my lordâ Sustain it like a man.âIt can be only Some casual strong similitude. Observe; Here is no name. Cos. Whose characters are these?â Whose penâwhose mind could so express?â No, no, by Heaven,âthis is no counterfeit.â But hark ye, mistress, how camest thou by this? Jacq. Here, Signor, in the hollow of this tree My eye in passing fell upon it. Cos. When? Jacq. Now. Cos. Haunts she about here?âhast thou lately seen her? Jacq. Now, as I stood debating with myself, Skreened by these drooping branches, I descried her Hitherward moving with a stealthy step. Perceiving me, she started, blushed, and vanished. Cos. (walks to and fro: striking his breast.) O, burst!âAnd yet what eye-beams fell upon me When first I clasped herâonly yesterday!â The flush, the smile, the tear of welcoming, The wild confusionâhad not that a tongue?â Yet here 's the living witness. Jacq. Say not soâ Rendârend it.âWherefore should she trust Such vouchers here? in this sequestered walk? The winds might waft them to the moon, as soon As any likely chance to Florence. Cos. He 's hereâI 've seen him. Jacq. Heavenly grace forbid! Cos. But now, I came upon him unawares:â He started, scowled upon me like a Demon, And hastily withdrew. Jacq. I'm sorry, Signor,â My heart weeps blood for you. Cos. To waste her sweetnessâYet how can it be?â What doth the viper here, though?âCursed, cursed folly! When but a pass had rid the world of him. Jacq. How longâpardon, my gracious lord, but may I ask, how long since you left BelvederÃ©? Cos. Six fatal years. Jacq. (starting.) Six years?âI knew not that. Cos. I see your thoughts. Alas! alas! would God I ne'er had left her! round her guileless steps I should have watched. But honorable deeds Seemed needful even to my hopes in her. And ah! I thought no time, no chance, would change her. Jacq. Few hearts are of a temper proof to time. Cos. Tyrant!â Better thou 'dst laid her in an unsoiled grave, And strewed sweet maiden emblems over it! Jacq. Hast thou e'er wrong'd him? Cos. Never; but have galled, Galled to the quick, his unforgiving pride. And now he stabs me to the life of life. Baffled of open vengeance, like a burglar He has broke into my heart's treasure-house. And yetâonly last night, her smile was peace!â She put me from my suit though,âtwice she did it,â On some slight pretext:âthat she did evade;â But it was done, methought, in such sweet accents As seemed most gracious to me. Jacq. Woman 's a riddle, or a kind of Sphinx, Of nature most occult,âsure to be variable,â Set, though unstable,âblind to old desert, Agape for new,âafraid of her own shadow, Yet dashing with spread sails for some gay headland, Through straits and whirlpools that make seamen pale. Capricious, insect-like, she oft alights, But never settles. Passion is the flower On which she poises her empurpled wings To sip and revel; but who thinks to seize her, Finds her light pennons watchful. Honest men Study her contradictions like a text; Believe her freezing when she shows most ice, And think her melting when her eyelids mould Bullets to store the arsenal of mischief. My lord, I 've seen your converse but a day, And could have sworn by every outward sign She loved ye dear as life. I half believed Her follies were forgotten. Cos. What means that? Jacq. Her loveâher fondnessânay, her foolish fancyâ My lord, I know not how to speak it out; Your wildness frights me. Cos. (seizing her.) Speak! I charge thee!âSpeak! Spare not a tittle, as thou 'dst shun my wrath! Jacq. I prithee loose me, Signor; you shall know. Cos. But allâlet me have all. Jacq. You shall, my lord. Cos. Go on,âfear not,âso you keep nothing back. Jacq. A year ago, about the Easter tide, The Count and his two daughters spent a month In Florence. There, the Marquis Barbadeca saw And loved the younger. What the reasons were, I know not; but the Count declined his suit, Abruptly, absolutely; and cut short His stay in Florence to be rid of him. But he, enamoured, came to BelvederÃ©, And here besieged us, till, as I supposed, Despairing of the heart he sighed forâ Cos. Why? Did she use him coldly? Jacq. She was coy, Her father peremptory. So he left us. Some three weeks passed along. One afternoon, All taking their siesta, I, by chance Needing some rosemary for a present purpose, Went through the shrubbery past that old arched gate Sunk in the trellised wall. That gate is kept, Now-a-days, locked. Perceiving, as I passed, The key just peeping from within, I stopped; And, finding it made fast inside, climbed up A little ladder left against the vine That, mantling o'er the wall, quite sheltered me, To see who, at that hour, was there: for this Is the Count's private place of meditation; And he, I knew, was sleeping in his chamber. Cos. Well? Jacq. Well, as I live, my lord, to my amazement, I saw her with the Marquis, arm in arm, In a close shaded alley. Cos. Demetria? Jacq. As true, my lord, as yonder shines the sun, Arm locked in arm, with this same Barbadeca. Cos. O, wretched!âlost!âdegraded!â Jacq. They seemed in earnest conference. As they passed me, I could distinguish words, and tones, and looks, (Endearing all,) but, when they walked away, Their voices sank to murmurs. Once, I caught This much from him: â'T is painful to deceive A father, but we 've no alternative.â Cos. Villain! Jacq. I did not hear, and cannot now recount, Connectedly their talk. Like plighted lovers, In low and earnest tones they spake; their theme Made more intelligible by their looks At last, I heard your name, my lord. Cos. What followed? Jacq. I almost fearâ Cos. Away! be honest,âspeak. Jacq. My lord, I could not catch the sequent words; But they grew mirthful. He in merry mood Vented some wit, which she responded to. He challenged her with having loved some one, Whose name I only could make out by guess. She vowed 't was false; protesting volubly. But at their next turn I distinguished this:â âWhen he dwelt here, I scarce out of my childhood, He wrote me posies, plucked me flowers, and so forth. What then? Three days beyond the parting hour His image never crossed my fancy more.â Cos. Did she say that? Jacq. She did, indeed, my lord. Cos. (for a moment overpowered.) Heaven knows,âHeaven, only, e'er can know, How long, how fondly, I have clung to thee!â And thou hast been to me an angel,âever Infusing nectar in my bitter cup. When hope withdrew, and left no gleam along The sad horizon, thou hadst power to light Life's melancholy vista! Morning oped, And evening fell, sweeter because a day, A night, had flown to re-unite us! Thanksâ Thanksâmany a mountain watch-fire in the Bannat, Thy image gladdened past Armida's gardens!â I would have died for thee!âAll, all is cancelled!â Now, though I knew her gulled by foulest practice, Though I could prove it, and, by proving it, Make her mine own again, I would not turn Thusâto reclaim her. Jacq. Nobly spoken!â Before he pressed her lips at leave takingâ Cos. (starting.) God! Jacq. He earnestly besought her, if, as rumored, You should return, and urge old vows upon her,â (For vows he would persist had passed between ye,) He prayed her still to wear a gracious eye, Till he could clear the way, with prudent speed, Of obstacles he named. Then his proud walls Should bid them, kinsmen, lovers, all, defiance. Cos. Ha! now the web 's unravelled!â't is to this I owe her glances. Jacq. Looks more speaking, Signor, I'm sure I never saw,âyet modest too. They staggered me, though privy to their secret. This, Sir, is all;âfearing surprise, I stayed No longer. Cos. Can she stoop to cheat me?â Poor maid!âDetested cozenage must have done it! Not thought upon me!âHeaven forgive the sin, If I have thought less of my God than thee! Jacq. Farewell, my lord.âMy lady may remark My lengthened absence.âSince it thus o'ercomes you, I cannot but repent,âthough duty seemed To prompt, what accident surprised from me. Adieu! adieu!âFate deals on noblest hearts Her bitterest spite. (Exit.) Cos. Soâmy bubble 's broken!â And have I dreamed so long? only imagined The rapture of this meeting? Is it all Ideal? unsubstantial?âAm I such a wretch?â (Putting his hand to his heart.) A horrid pressure!âNever thought upon me! Although my breast has been her throne, her shrineâ (Voices heard in the wood approaching: Cosmo retires.) SCENE II. Olivia's chamber. Olivia and Jacquelina. Jacq. Speak not so faintly; it will not recoil. Oliv. Thou know'st not that. One interview, one word Of soft expostulation 's ruin. Jacq. 'Sdeath! Is this a time for halts, and snail-paced fears?â Lady, we 're in for 't; launched; and must bestir Ourselves to scape the quicksands. Oliv. GentlyâO, more gently.â But say again,âhow spake he? how looked he? Jacq. Nay, nay, I 've told you thrice. Oliv. Raised he no scruple? Jacq. O, yes; and puzzled for a while To reconcile her conduct with the letterâ Oliv. The snare,âthe rash, the fatal snare! Jacq. But here, My gloss, like every able commentator's, Perplexed the plain and simple to our purpose. No, no; belief has full possession of him.â His temper mainly serves us. Ne'er will he Confront and tax her with her perfidy, As many a man would do: he will conceal The bleeding hurt, till thy sweet surgery Have time to heal it. As for her, she 'd fade To alabaster ere complain to mortal. Oliv. But what avails all this, unlessâ Jacq. (singing.) What boots thy labor, gentle squire? What thank have ye? If Don Padilla Forswear Pedrilla, Yet never vail his crest to me? Coraggio!âHence, our tactics are by rule.â 'T is but to ply our catapults of eyes;â Bid Cupid, if his archery fail, unmask Heavier artillery; push his batteries In sight o' the citadel; display our flag, That floats redundant round a neck like Juno's, And his astonished heart capitulates! Oliv. Have done with flourishes, and plainly sayâ Jacq. First probe the wound that rankles in his pride. He thinks Lord Cosmo jilted. Gall him first. Then drop in balm upon the smarting spot, By telling him some flattering, tender tale, Aptly contrived; and, when the mood is on, Whisper how well it were, and how deserved, To show this fickle fair one he contemns her By wedding with a maid, who long has hung With secret passion o'er his image. Oliv. Rare! Jacq. But I must use ye freely. I must swear You sigh his name to rills, carve it on trees, Twine it with love-knots, like Angelica Her young Medoro's;âevidence the same, Impressed, perhaps, in some sequestered shade; Protest you waste the sleepless hours on him, And in your dreams hold converse with his ghost. Oliv. Be wary, O, be wary:âthou grow'st giddy. Jacq. Now, to the hall. Remember your own part. Sadden your aspect; let your languishing eye Dwell on him as the bird's upon the serpent's:â Soon as he marks, avert it;âheave a sigh;â A gentle sigh,âperceptible,âbut just To show the swelling of your bosom. Oliv. (aside.) Familiar insolence! (Exeunt.) ACT III. SCENE I. The garden. Cosmo alone. Cos. Why, why does nature form us so?â Nor gird the wretch predestined to endure, With hoops of steel,âcase him in adamant,â Buckler him some way 'gainst the cruel shafts?â O, partial Fate! why must the generous heart So often bleed and agonize,âtranspierced By faithless friendship, or more faithless love?â Accursed delusion!âTwining round the soul So gently,âbinding golden link on link,â All the while lulling us with some sweet song, Till, giddy with enchantment, and fast bound, She starts,âtransforms into a fiend,â Wrenches the heart-strings, and is gone for aye! Death! what mock am I?âIs this the spot Where, but last night, we roved?âWho then so blestâ (Enter Jacquelina, from one of the walks.) Jacq. What, Signor, still in sadness? Cos. Leave me. Jacq. O, speak not thus. Call up Your noble resolution: minds heroic Wrestle with fate itself, and spurn at trifles. Nay, nay, my lord,â Cos. Is it no more?âto lose The star that ruled and cheered my mental heaven, And reft of which, I'm left upon life's sea Benighted and alone. Jacq. I meant not so. It is a trial; and demands of youâ Cos. I had collected all my hopes around her; There, there they clung, and, with her, lived or died. Sweet, scattered blossoms! whirled away for ever! Jacq. Such ever was, and will be, fickle woman. Cos. Methinks I'm laboring in a fearful trance,â Appalling images and horrid dangers Glare in upon me, yet they still seem phantoms. Jacq. As when we weep in dreams, yet hope our grief Will prove a dream. So yours, my lord, will prove. Cos. The dark cloud was behind me, and the bow Bestrid it; all before, was lucid; flowers Diffused their odors; birds and waters sang Along my path, that gently seemed to wind Through shade and sunshine, round enamelled slopes, Down fairy vales, through opening mountains blue. Now, like some shipwrecked desolate, I standâ Jacq. Why waste your sorrow on a worthless object?â It would but furnish cruel merriment.â Cast her away, and place your love, my lord, On one who knows to prize it. Cos. Can she jest At Cosmo's anguish, who has wept, so oft, When only fancied ills assailed her? Oft, Imagination harrowing up my soul With some sad vision of her death or sufferings, I 've, waking, found my face all bathed in tears. Jacq. Credit me, once for all, my gracious lord,â Cos. Truth, sanctitude, and maiden constancy! Where are ye exiled? Once, ye waved round her Your crystal arms, and made her footsteps holy. Jacq. I could revealâI know a heart, as true, As fair,âwhere every virtue, every grace Abides, that honors woman. Cos. False, I swear. Jacq. And more, my lord. When night and silence woo Even sorrow to repose, this angel breathes The secret sigh for Cosmo. Cos. Peace, and begone! Jacq. By blessed Mary's life, 't is true. Cos. Thou liest; Thou 'rt perjured;âtrouble me no longer. Jacq. If there 's a saint in Paradise, or soul In Purgatory, bliss for faith, or fire For lack of 't, 't is a sacred truth. Upon My life, and soul's salvation, it is true. Cos. Who? Who mourns with hapless Cosmo? for the bond Of sympathy shall join us! Jacq. O, my lord, How the pure red would paint her cheek with shame And anger, did she dream her secret breathed Even to the wind. Cos. Being herself Unable to conceal it, thou 'rt not bound. Jacq. No contumely. Remember how disdain From one beloved has racked thy soul, and learn Compassion. Cos. O, I know not what I say. Jacq. Perhaps I err, my lord; but thus to see What should be life's bright morning overcast, See her in hopeless misery pine,âI cannot;â Despite the consequences, should she ever, Ever suspect, I'll venture to disclose. (Looking about her and speaking low.) My lord,âOlivia loves you,âlong has loved,â And with the deepest, tenderest passion. Cos. Ha! ha! Jacq. (disconcerted.) Signor,âI thoughtâ Can he lay claim to sympathy, who scorns The wretched? Cos. She wasting with a secret passion!â And thou believ'st it?âWhy, what barefoot lass, That follows goats over the breezy mountains, Hath fresher roses or an eye more buxom?â No, no, my girl; you must invent once more. Jacq. My lord, appearances deceive. I 've seen A young and beauteous lady on her death-bed, Nay, in her coffin, dressed for her last sleep, With such a bloom yet lingering on her cheek As flushes yonder peaks when day 's departed. Cos. And how learn'dst thou this precious secret? Jacq. The soul, my lord, is fashionedâlike the lyre. Strike one chord suddenly, and others vibrate. Your name abruptly mentioned, casual words Of comment on your deeds, praise from your uncle, News from the armies, talk of your return, A word let fall touching your youthful passion, Suffused her cheek, called to her drooping eye A momentary lustre, made her pulse Leap headlong, and her bosom palpitate. I could not long be blind, for love defies Concealment, making every glance, and motion, Silence, and speech a tell-taleâ Cos. Is this all? Jacq. These things, though trivial of themselves, begat Suspicion. But long months elapsed, Ere I knew all. She had, you know, a fever. One night, when all were weary and at rest, I sitting by her couch, tired and o'erwatched, Thinking she slept, suffered my lids to close. Waked by a voice, I found herânever, Signor, While life endures, will that scene fade from me,â A dying lamp winked in the hearth, that cast, And snatched the shadows. Something stood before me In white. My flesh began to creep. I thought I saw a spirit. It was my lady risen, And standing in her night-robe with clasped hands, Like one in prayer. Her pallid face displayed Something, methought, surpassing mortal beauty. She presently turned round, and fixed her large, wild eyes, Brimming with tears, upon me, fetched a sigh, As from a riven heart, and cried: âHe 's dead! But hush!âweep not,âI 've bargained for his soul,â That 's safe in bliss!ââDemanding who was dead, Scarce yet aware she raved, she answered quick, Her Cosmo, her beloved; for that his ghost, All pale and gory, thrice had passed her bed. With that, her passion breaking loose, my lord, She poured her lamentation forth in strains Pathetical beyond the reach of reason. âGone, gone, gone to the grave, and never knew I loved him!ââI 'd no power to speak, or move.â I sat stone still,âa horror fell upon me. At last, her little strength ebbed out, she sank, And lay, as in death's arms, till morning. Cos. Hath she at no time spoke of this? Jacq. Long after, Signor, she did task me closely, If in a certain night she had not raved. By searching questions she drew forth the truth. Cos. What said she then? Jacq. She charged me never to divulge her shame, Not as I loved her life, and said the secret Should go down with her to the tomb. But I Vowed inly, on that solemn night, if e'er I saw, to break it to Lord Cosmo. Cos. Too harshly judged!â Poor partner in misfortune!âSayst thou so?â While I saw life's bright seasons rolling by, Enslaved unto the falsest, fairest phantom That ever took Heaven's semblance to deceive!â O! I could clasp, and weep upon her neck! Jacq. What! sigh and weep? Yield her that triumph?âHiss rather!âOne bold effortâ Cast her disgraceful shackles off, and wed A matchless lady whose whole heart is yours. Cos. (starting.) Marry! Jacq. Why not? Cos. Marry Olivia? Jacq. Ay; marry:âshow this giddy nymph her error, Who thinks to hold you still in thraldom. Devils! Before I 'd be her jest with Barbadecaâ Cos. O, 't is bitter. Jacq. 'T is plain the slippery pair exult In your imagined anguish. Such an act Would cloud their honey-moon. Cos. And that were well,â That, that were well. Jacq. Besides, you gain, my lord, A gentle, constant friend, whose soft endearments, In time will woo you backâ Cos. Leave me alone.â The thought has struck me.âIt would disturb their mirth. Leave me.â(Exit Jacquelina.) Marry!âThat would sting her home! Though a loathed reptile has with poison mixed The springs of her affection,âthough she scorns me,â 'T would grieve her pride, were I to wed another. Beholding me kneeling beside her sister, She may come to herself, and shake this dream Of folly off. Her early love may gush, Like pent-up waters, back into her heart!â But thenâthen we are partedâ O, misery!âwhich way shall I turn?âAre these The nuptials I have panted for? These, these, The transports?âHeaven have mercy!âO, Demetria! How couldst thou bury in oblivion all Those hallowed hours, so fraught with feeling!âstoopâ But if she be not fallen past belief, If one last spark of tenderness remain, I'll rouse it, though the effort cost my life. I'll watch her as I swear myself away;â Then, if she falters,âif one gush of tears Betray her,âI am recompensed for torture. (Exit.) SCENE II. A retired part of the wood: Barbadeca and Jacquelina. Jacq. It helps us either way:âbest, if they wed; For then Demetria's hope lies desolate, And she becomes more ductile to your will. If not, the tale deceives them; when she 's seized, It seems elopement, and averts our peril. Barb. How does she bear it? Jacq. Why, as martyrs, fire.â Speed, speed, or truth will out. Her swollen eye And ashy cheek cannot be long unnoticed. He, too, will melt: this angry gust o'erblown, The natural current of his soul will set, And sweep our schemes to nothing. Love of this sort Is not a hasty flame lighted by fancy, That blazes and expires. It grew with him From early days; hope wore its hues; its tints Are over all his retrospect; it lives Essential with the spark of life, and death May fail to quench it. Barb. When, and where, Can we best take her? Jacq. Close upon the river, Just where it turns the point of BelvederÃ©, Stands a pavilion, like a summer-house, Crowned with a little spiral pinnacleâ Barb. I know the place. Jacq. That is the surest, safest.â It was their haunt, when, in their love's first bloom, They used to steal away together. When he Betook him to the wars, I 've heard them say She almost made it her abode; seemed ever Happiest when planting round it flowers; and there, When the untroubled moon was in the Arno, And all was dew and fragrance, oft retired, In tender reverie, or with her lute Recalling favorite airs of Cosmo.âAh! To sever hearts so knit seems heinous. Signor, I'm taking that upon me for your sakeâ Barb. Does she frequent there still? Jacq. O, constantly:â You may descry her from the farther bank. Station your horsemen there, and dart across, With one or two staunch followers, in a skiff. Barb. What hour were surest? Jacq. Woods have echoes, mind.â Loup-garou may be prowling:âyou best know The peril 's in his fang. Barb. No more of that. He feels me in his vitals now, and shall In his best blood, if Fate again confront us.â But will his jealous frenzy drive the fool To wedlock? Jacq. Not if he take time to cool. But while the transport lasts, if he address Olivia or his uncle, he 's committed. Then pride will force him on, consistent pride, The stumbling-stone of honorable asses. Barb. Hell catch him, if he fall. Jacq. And keep him!â Or, some day, you and I may rue these pranks. No matter:âlet future ills physic themselves.â And so, my lord,âmore to the present purpose,â I think I 've been herein your humble handmaid. Barb. My plotter, executor, head, hand, all! Think not thy zeal misprized, my pretty witch, Got by the Devil, or else by Machiavelli. There 's for thee. (Gives her a purse.) Jacq. Thanks, my lord Marquis, thanks.â'T is now a year And some odd months, since I, at your entreaty, Left Florence, and a wealthy service.âIs it not? Barb. Why, thereabouts. Jacq. I fastened on this house, and here have toiled For your advancement. Have I not? Barb. Thou look'st Like a green widow, screwing up thy mouth Less than a purse-ring. Jacq. In my zeal to serve you, I 've wronged my conscience, taken grievous things To my account. I scarcely dare look back. Barb. What! cant!âThou? thou? Jacq. You smile. But I 've a soul,â A precious soul,âand, well thou know'st, deep guilt To be assoiled. Barb. Spare your preamble, holy lady Abbess, And to the point. Jacq. Well then, my gracious lord, You may remember, on a certain day, You being downcast with your hopeless suit, I cheered you;âcounselled so and so; revived Your spirits,âsmoothed your difficulties,â Till hope and resolution chased despair. You took a solemn oath upon you then, An oath most binding, if through me you ever Attained the mastery of that froward beauty, You would endow me with a seat you owned, With some small lands about it, on the Ombrone. Barb. Ha! ha! I thought the circuit would end land-wise. So, being conscience-laden, you 'd forswear This wicked, wicked world, and in your snug House on the Ombrone negotiate with Heaven? Jacq. If it be not too late. Barb. Well, when she 's won. Jacq. (producing a paper and an ink-horn.) Just say that much herein. Barb. Thou faithless jade! Jacq. 'T is but to sign.âYou know the proverb, Signor. Barb. (looks over the paper, signs, and returns it.) Art satisfied?âNow sayâat what fixed hour Shall we attempt her? Jacq. If the sky be fair, Just as the ruddy evening streaks are fading, The place I 've named is her accustomed seat: Night, and the moon, will favor after. Now, My lord, if all be answered, and if all Be understood, we best had separate. Barb. Farewell, my girl. All 's settled, as I think. Jacq. How long before you venture her in Florence? Barb. When all her scruples vanish; when she smiles, And treats me as a husband, and will swear Not to betray me. Jacq. Bind her strongly there.â Farewell! be watchful, and be resolute. Barb. When do you quit them? Jacq. O, I cannot tell: Not till the tumult 's over. So, adieu! (Exit Barbadeca.) Not till our compact 's sure.âIf Cosmo wed her I have herâsealed; and by the vengeful gods I pin her to the bond, or that divulge, Shall sink her lower than her eyes dare look. All hail the day, invoked, deferred so long! Freed from the abject lot imposed upon me By faithless, perjured man,âenriched,ârevenged,â I'll shrive, do penance,âperadventure deck Some shrine, and feed the holy candlesticks, Till virgin wax hath cancelled virgin shame. (Exit.) SCENE III. Count Amerigo alone in his apartment. Count. Had she been spared to me, the golden sheaf Of my domestic joys had now been perfect. But favoring Heaven yet promises my age A liberal harvest; I dare breathe no murmur; Vouchsafed a counterpart of her I lost, So near, so dear, that her pure spirit seems Abiding with me. Soul of gentleness! Dear image of thy mother! so thou 'rt happy, Peace harbours yet with old Amerigo. Methought, to-day, her cheek was wan, her eyes Looked red with weeping. Every gracious influence Defend and nourish thee, for thou 'rt a plant Too tender for the nipping blasts of sorrow. Often, and earnestly, her mother wished That hers and Cosmo's kindred naturesâ (Enter Cosmo.) Cos. God bless thee, uncle. Count. Thanks, my son. Cos. If you 're at leisure, I would crave a moment. Count. Sit down; I'll hear thee gladly.âBut thou art pale, Nay, very pale. Cos. (seating himself.) I'm well, Sir,ânever better.â 'T is now ten years since I was left an orphan;â You took me home,âhave been a father to me,â Had my own lived, he could not have done more, But yetâyetâthere 's a boonâone boonâ Count. My son, Demand with confidence, for I'll deny Nothing to thee. Cos. My lord,âyou have a daughterâ Give meâbless me, I meanâ Count. Your suit is granted. I have indeed a daughter, dear to me Above all price; but to your proven honor I dare entrust her. Cos. Thanks, uncleâthanksâO, thanksâ Count. O, Cosmo, but one like her ever lived!â Like a chance violet, that springs ere frosts Are over, whose brief date each one foretells, She ever seemed; yet she survives, and blooms. O cherish her with tenderest sympathy, Watch o'er her peace with soft solicitude; So shall she flourish and adorn thy fortunes. Neglect would kill her. Now forgive my plainness.â I see thou 'rt movedâforgiveâI'll say no more. Nay, nay, my sonâ(Taking his hand affectionately.) Cos. Perhapsâperhapsâ Count. I greet thee as my son,âmy chosen son,â And tell thee frankly, I know not another In the world's range to whom I would commit her. This has Heaven's seal:âher mother blesses ye:â My heart is now at rest. Cos. Praise Heaven, then, uncle,â A quiet bosom 'sâO! 't is priceless, pricelessâ None knows its value but the wretch who 's lost it.â But you are doubly blest, my lord. Count. What says my son? Cos. You 've two fair daughters. Count. And virtuous too, As well as fair. Cos. No doubt. And, now, my lord, Strengthen a mother's with a father's blessing:â Make Cosmo and Olivia rich indeed. Count. (rising, in surprise.) Olivia! Cos. Sir, your blessing. Count. Olivia? Cos. What means my lord? Count. Was it Olivia's hand? Cos. The same, my lord. Count. Ha!âbut, Cosmo,â Know'st thouâart thou awareâ (Tenderly, and irresolutely.) Surely, my son, It was my younger child. Cos. (suppressing emotion.) You much mistook me. Count. I labored in a grievous error, Cosmo,â My thoughts were on Demetria. Cos. Still dost thou grant Olivia to my love? Count. (after a pause.) If Cosmo ask it. Cos. I do. And, prithee, no delays, For I must leave ye. Count. Leave us! Cos. Bellona 's loose:â The trumpet brays again:âmy regiment Is summoned, or soon will be. I have seen The rescript. Furious Achmet swears to leave Belgrade as level as the Oman desert, And light Vienna with more moons than stars. Farewell, my lord: you 've done me honor. (Exit.) Count. Amazement!â I thought he meant to dwell in peace among us!â What change is this?âAlas! I fear, I fear Her soul is set on him.âI, too, have helped it:â Still must I dwell on him and magnify His virtues. Whence can such mischanceâHe loved herâ He surely loved her,âevery act proclaimed it.â Ah me! who'll break these tidings?âWho can answer 't?â Great God! this is a stroke I had not looked for. (Exit.) ACT IV. SCENE I. The pavilion, beside the Arno:âa table, lute, and drawing implements:âDemetria seated near a window opening to the evening sky. Dem. I feared some evil chance.âO! Cosmo, Cosmo! Have I deserved such bitter punishment?â If thou hast ceased to love, methinks, at least, Thou mightst have broke the heavy truth more gently! Such looks! such coldness! O, they chill to death. Knowing the child I am in my affections, Thou shouldst have weaned me tenderly. It had been A generous tribute paid a wretch whose peace Is gone for ever.âWhat can I have done?â Sure, he 's not angered that I listed not His suit, while tears (renewed at sight of him) Streamed for a buried mother.â'T were not like him:â It cannot be. (Pauses.) O, time!âa change indeed!â The night before he left us, here we sat; Yon trees, the sky, the yellow-gleaming hills, Thus beautiful! Then, when I weeping wished To ope the volume of futurity, How he consoled me! How he spoke, the while, Of fading friendships, of forgotten love, And when I warned him how new scenes, new hopes, The intoxicating world, renown, and grandeur, Might banish from his heart the faithful friends And simple joys he loved at BelvederÃ©, Ah! what a look he gave me!âAll forgotten!â Had I foreseen it,âcould I have believed it!â The long, long interval,âand now at last, The death of hopeâO, Cosmo! Cosmo! (Overcome with emotion, covers her face.) It cannot lastâmy heart is not so stubborn.â (Unties a small parcel of letters lying on the table.) This reached me,âO! I well remember it,â My hand clasped fast in my sweet mother's!âHours Of rapture! that 't is death to think on now!â One parting look, and I have done. (Unfolds a letter, which she peruses with a fluctuating countenance. Meanwhile a fishing boat, containing two persons in masks, glides from behind a woody point towards the pavilion. The Masks step out, and approach Demetria, who is too much abstracted to perceive them. First Mask. Well, Signorina,â Dem. (springing up.) Ha! what seek ye here? First Mask. No treachery. Can you tell usâ Dem. (retreating.) Heavens! Why do you follow me? First Mask. (still advancing.) We lost our way, Madonna,âwe stopped hereâ (Seizing her.) No noise,âno screaming,ânot, as life is dear,â Be stillâhush! hush!âno harm shall come to ye. (Forces her towards the boat.) Dem. (tearing his hand from her mouth.) Help!âmercy!âhelp! Second Mask. (covering her mouth.) Hush!âsilence!âelse the Arno 's nearâ (Just as they lay hands on her, Cosmo is seen approaching with a gloomy air along the path from the wood. Startled by her cry, he stops to observe; then rushes towards her with frantic speed, arriving, as she faints and they are proceeding to lay her in the boat.) Cos. Ha, ruffian! (Stabs one of the Masks, who falls in the water:âthe other retreats a step, draws, and advances fiercely upon him. Cosmo wounds him, and pressing him, he leaps into the boat and pushes off.) What fiends are these? (Tears off the mask of the fallen man.) What can it mean? (Raising Demetria in his arms.) How pale! Good heaven! she 's deadâor dying! What 's the best? Merciful Father!âis there none to help me?â (Hangs over her in terror, sprinkling water in her face.) She 's gone!âher cheek 's death white!âDemetria! My angel! O my only love! Have I Frowned on thee? I been angry?âNow, she 's gone! Curse, curse upon my cruelty! (Dem. sighs.) She lives! She breathes! (Loosens her sash, and bears her to one of the seats of the pavilion.) Demetria!âspeak!âO, speak to me! How deepâheart-breaking was that sob!âHa! hold! (He retires a little, and stands watching her: in a few moments she half rises, and looks wildly round, without perceiving him.) Dem. Where am I? Was itâcould it be a dream? Methought a sweet and mournful voice, but now, Was murmuring in my earâ(Perceives Cosmo.) Cos. (coming forward.) How farest thou, lady? Dem. Have I been dreaming, or a moment since Was set upon? Cos. Your piercing cries alarmed me. Know you the villains? Dem. No, my lord. What came of them? Cos. One fled; the other lies there. Dem. (seeing his sleeve stained with blood.) Heavens! art thou wounded, Cosmo? Cos. (with deep emotion.) Wounded?âNo,â He only grazed me. Dem. O! you bleed apace! Cos. There areâthere is a woundâ (Falters and pauses.) Lady, your handkerchiefâpray bind it thereâ (She knots her handkerchief round his arm.) Dem. Let me assist you homewardâLean on meâ You 're growing paler. Cos. (rises, and sinks back.) YesâI have a woundâ Deepâmortal,âthat the grave must answer. Dem. (terrified.) O, heaven!â Cos. A stab most cruelâbut a bloodless one. Dem. (her eyes resting on the floor.) My lord,â Will 't please you to escape the chill night air? Cos. And wherefore?â't is not like a cold false heart. Dem. (gathers up the letters, and binds the riband round them, while Cosmo sits speechless, watching her.) Here are some letters,âwhich,âmy lord,âin days Best now forgottenâ(Faintly.) Receive them, Sir. Cos. (grasping the letters.) All very well. Dem. You had a pictureâvalueless indeedâ A little portrait,âwill you give it me? Cos. A picture? Dem. Scarcely worth remembranceâ Cos. (who had involuntarily put his hand into his bosom, withdraws it.) Lady,âthat pictureâI was robbedâone night, Crossing a forest in the Tyrol mountainsâ In a dark gorge, some brigands rushed upon meâ They took purse, ring, and all,âa precious ring,â I much deplored the chance.âThe ring I had From an Archduchess' daughter. Dem. I'll send you aid. (Passes him swiftly, and leaves the pavilion.) Cos. (watching till she disappears.) So thenâall 's over!â Here are my lettersâscorn'dâgiven up;âthough dyed With my heart's blood!âO, murderous memory! (Lays them down, and looks round him.) Beside that lattice I confessed my passion,â Yon eglantine she drew to shade her face!â O, heaven!âO, hell!â (Starts up, tears the letters in fragments, and hurries away into the thick part of the wood.) SCENE II. A corridor, near a chamber door:âBianca passes cautiously along. Bian. That cabinet will skreen me.âBy and by I'll take my stand.âI may o'erhear yet more; Or, some way, take her in her craft.âHow now! What light is that gleams from the Countess' chamber? Who should be there?â (Listens a moment, and then exit softly.) SCENE III. An antique chamber: the walls tapestried: on one side of the bed, a picture of the Countess Amerigo:â by the light of a lamp standing on a table before a mirror, Demetria seen walking the room with a disordered mien. Dem. Married!âTo-morrow!âCosmo and Olivia! Do not my senses pass some horrid juggle? Some slight of darkness but to lure my doom?â Hush!âShadows seem to flit around me.âOh! To-morrow!âmy sister's wedding day!âO, where, Where, where, shall I be?â (Walks distractedly up and down: at last, stops before her mother's picture, bursting into tears.) O, mother! mother! why art thou not here?â In vain are all thy cautions,âvain thy counsels!â O! had I listened,âhad I but believed thee! Oft hast thou warned, prophetically warned me.â Thy worst forebodings all have come upon me!â Why, why, art thou not here?âO, could I pour My anguish in thy bosom!âCould thy voice But once more greet me! I'm alone:âI 've none To comfort me. Now, when my cry ascends, Thou canst not hear! O, wert thou here,âcouldst thou But clasp me!â Enter Bianca. Bian. Who 's here?âSignora,âmy sweet childâ What! is it you that sob so bitterly? Be comforted: do not weep so. Dem. Leave me. Bian. Alone, in this dusk chamber? No indeed. It overcomes me too: it brings to mind Sorrowful times. When my dear lady died, Just so it looked,âheart-breaking to us all. Alack! alack! she, too, poor suffering soul, Although she smiles so sweet in yonder picture, Had griefs you little dream of. Dem. What mean'st thou? Bian. I know what ails thee, though thou speakest not. I read it all. Thy face has been my book Too long, sweet child.âMy lady, too, was crossed. Dem. My mother? Bian. Oft at her bed's foot have I spent The weary watches, while her swelling heart Discharged its burthen. Dem. Heavens!âI never heardâ Tell me, Bianca,âcrossed? Bian. In love, Signora. Thou never heard'st itâno, nor any other. 'T was known, indeed, the Marquis broke a love troth, But I alone was privy to the matter. Dem. Tell me, Bianca,âhow was this? It seems Most strange. Bian. When just seventeen, she went to Naples, Where the Marchesa lived, her father's sister. The Marquis dwelt, you know, at Tivoli, A Roman born, and stern as Marcus Cato.â Three months she lingered. Well, soon afterwards A handsome Gascon chevalier came to us, Tall, graceful, handsomer by far than Cosmo. His looks betrayed his business; and her eyes Spake too intelligibly. One and all Imagined we must part with our loved mistress, Not dreaming that her father would oppose her. Dem. Did he, Bianca? Bian. Don't look so wild, and speak so passionate.â Next morning they were closeted, and brief work He made of it. If she took Count DÃ©mÃ©trÃ©e (His name), he swore she forfeited for ever His presence, heart, and dying benediction. Dem. O! my poor mother, how must this Have fallen on thee! Bian. Being called in haste, I found my lady swooned, the Marquis wroth, The stranger gone. Dem. Why was this cruelty? Bian. Because the Marquis loathed a Huguenot. Dem. Inhuman! Bian. All that day, my lady kept Fainting, and, as it were, 'twixt life and death. The next night she dismissed me to my rest; But waking, and afraid she lacked, I softly Stole to her chamber. Think of my amazement!â Her bed was empty,âthe balcony open! It jutted o'er the garden, and I heard Murmurs like plaintive voices. Looking out, I saw them. Then, indeed, I lent an ear:â I feared her flight: the slant moon showed it midnight: The snort and stamp of horses made me think All things were ready; (so indeed they were;) But filial duty triumphed. O! their parting!â At first he urged her, but at last consoled. In fine, they bade adieu, to meet no more. Dem. And did they never? Bian. Ere a year, He fell in Flanders. Dem. Luckless, luckless mother! Whom hadst thou then to comfort thee? Bian. No soul. She knew no comfort. Life Wore on, without complaint, but never gladdened. At last, I told her what I saw; and then She gave me all her story. Dem. Ah!â Methinks I hear her!âO, how looked she?âSay, Bianca,âgive to me her very tones. Bian. Meek, patient; striving still to cheer the Marquis; Who fell, at last, into a melancholy. Dem. Now, now, I know why clouds came over thee As often as we questioned of thy youth. Well mightst thou warn me,âfeelingly couldst thou Enlarge on such a theme. Bian. Time blunted sorrow; But never was my lady what she had been In her May morning. Dem. Yet a seraph smile Plays yonder round her lip. Bian. Yourself, Signora, A tiny, blue-eyed thing lay in my arms, Brimful of glee, reaching your little hands As if to tempt her. 'T is at you she smiles. Dem. (going towards the picture.) Was it on me?âdid I draw forth that smile?â Ah! why not told ere this?âThat I had known Thy story, too! Couldst thou so sweetly smile? Couldst thou seem happy, and shall I complain? Just Heaven, forgive my wild designs. I'll suffer:â I'll bear it all:âthough sorrows overwhelm me, I'll never murmur for her angel sake. Bian. (Falling on her knees, and clasping Demetria's feet.) O, now I'm happy,âblest and happy,â Ah! my sweet child, I heard thy bitter wail; I heard thy dreadful menaces. Praise Jesu! Thou hast abandoned them. Though judgments fall With weight upon thee, threat not life. My child, Self-murder is a sin unpardonable: No rite, mass, sacrament, nothing can reach it! Think! Should she stretch from bliss in vain to save A suicidal outcastâ Dem. Stop! stop!âO, speak not thus!â'T is dreadful!âHeaven Forgive the impious thought!âI'll bear it.âRise. But O! I hope the trial will not last! When, when, may I lie down in peace? Bian. Be cheered, Sweet lady; strength will be vouchsafed ye. Dem. No,â But is it settled? Will it be to-morrow? Bian. I fear. Dem. What says she? Has she asked to see me? Bian. No, Signora. Dem. Cruel, cruel sister! I would not so have marred thy peace, to gain A world. Bian. Kin are not kind, in this we live inâ One would imagine.âBut they 're both a tiptoe.â Malicious serpent!âMark my wordsâthat slut Hath scorpions at her conscience. Late last night Crossing the upper corridor, there came A moan as from her chamber; stopping by it, I heard her muttering in her sleep a jargonâ The horridest jumble ever put togetherâabout Some funeral, or marriage ceremony. O, yes, I'm certain something damning weighs Upon her. âQuick,â she cried, âthe nuptial pall! Call in the music!âscrew the lid!âFoh! foh!â She named that Barbadeca twice, and whispered, âBe secret, secret, secret,âbut no blood.â And then she 'd groan. I could not make her drift; But am resolved to watch again to-night. Pernicious viper! now she 's with Olivia Fingering the bridal ornamentsâ Dem. Bianca! Oh! Bianca!â Bian. Take heart, Signora. Dem. Would I were in my grave. Bian. Something is wrong.â Look at him, if his woe-gone face be lit With nuptial smiles. He locks himself apart, Or roams about, as restless as a ghost; Trust me, he loves thee still, and some vile wretch (That impâwho knows?) has some how slandered thee. Dem. It cannot be. Bian. I 'd risk my life 't is so. What else can so have changed him? Dem. NoâO no. Whom have I injured? What could she say of me? Bian. Thou fanciest every breast as pure as thine. Let me expostulate with him, and know If some false taleâ Dem. (vehemently.) I charge thee, noâno, as thou lovest me.âWhat! Degrade myself to that?âSue for his pity?â Seek to reclaim a fickle lover?âNever! I charge thee as my peaceâmy life is dear, Never to do it. Promiseâswear to me. Bian. Be calm, be calm, Signora; I'll obey thee. Dem. If he can harbour slanderous tales against me, He ne'er shall know his error, till too late. But when my aching heart 's at rest for everâ Then,âif he finds he wronged me,âlet him come And weep his hard suspicions where I lie. Bian. (taking the lamp and Demetria's arm.) Come, lady, let us leave this gloomy chamber:â Yon grisly heathen in the tapestry Scowl on us;âverily they daunt me:âcome. (Leads her out.) SCENE IV. The garden, at midnight: the sky lowering. Cosmo enters without a hat: after wandering about disturbedly, throws himself on the ground. Cos. O that I were a shackled slave!âthe wretched'st That ever earned the bread of toil!âMarry her! What, marryâI cannotâO, no, noâ What fiend seduced?âwhat worse than frenzyâOh! To-morrowâand farewell to hopeâlinked, linked, Indissolubly linked to life-long woe!â Where, now, are all those dreams of bliss, So dear, so tender, they attuned my heart To ecstasy?âGone, perished, blotted out, With that fair, fancied excellence!âCan she Sleep sweetly while such billows toss my soul?â Yonder 's her chamberâLies she there In tranquil slumber? Ah! who 's in her dream? OnceâBut never, never, never more!â Mountains have risen, oceans roll between us!â O! what a snare is tangled round meâ Enter Orsini. Ors. This way the sound was.âHa! (Perceiving Cosmo on the ground.) Is this kind dealing, Cosmo? Why not impart thy sorrows to a friend? Cos. Intrude not here. Who spoke of sorrows? Leave me. Ors. Small skill have I in marriage mysteries, Or aught pertaining to the sex thou dotest on, But if these be the nuptial joys I came To witness, gods keep me ungyved, and grant No mistress but my sword. I thought to see A bridegroom's face caparisoned in smiles, Love-knots and wreaths of roses blooming round His voluntary chains; a merry prelude, Whatever might come after. But, by Heaven, When you came forth to welcome me, a thief's, A sentenced traitor's look was ne'er more haggard. Their faces all within seem clad in mourning. How savagely you answered, when I broke A harmless jest on your approaching bondage. Cos. Death, poverty, or shame,âbut name not that! Ors. Why there it is!âSpeak out.âWhat is it wrings Thy spirit thus?âI 've heard thy hasty step Beating the chamber; heard thee stealing out, And, on my soul, I knew not but thou 'dst come To do some rashness. Speak. What ails thee? Cos. I'm a wretch. Ors. What cursed thing has happened? Cos. I'm betrayed. Leave me. Ors. Who has betrayed thee? Cos. She,âthe fiend Who had my heart in keeping. Ors. Weary not My patience. Tell the plain, right onward story; Then, if heart, sword, or honest counselâ Cos. Remember'stâKnow'st of whom so oft I spake? Ors. Demetria. Cos. O! I thought in her was summed All excellence,âso pure, so gentle, faithfulâ Ors. I know you thought so. Cos. Thought her heart my prize; Believed she loved me with a spotless passion. To see me wedded to this paragon I asked thy presence. Ors. Well? Cos. She 's falseâI'm cozened;â To serve her amorous purpose with another, She but dissembled. Ors. What! and still thou wed'st her? Cos. Wed'st?âO, heaven!â No, no, I do not wed her!âCarlo! ah! I'm not so blessed. For, spite of all,âwrongs, guilt, And shame,âspite of my soul, I love her. Ors. Curseâ And dost thou beat up this ado, because The cunning harlotry has spared thy name To brand dishonor elsewhere? Cos. No, I say. Ors. What then? Unfold your riddles. Cos. That this, that this Were all!âand yet 't were cause methinks.â Orsini,âO!âto-morrowâcurse upon it!â Shackles me to Olivia. Ors. (checking surprise.) Well, she 's fair, And stately; what of that? Cos. I love her not;â Have I not told thee?âEvery fibre clings To that deceiver. Ors. Rash, misguided man! Thinking to pique her, make her feel, with all Her wiles she could not hurt thee, thou hast pulled Destruction on thy head. Cos. Thou hast it. Ors. Jove! I pity thee. How couldst thou be so mad? Cast prudence clean away? and fling the reins To wildestâ Cos. Spare your breath:âI'm in no mood:â Go to the earthquake:âask why it desolates. Ors. But how was this discovered? Who unmasked her? Is it proved? certain? Cos. As the hell that racks me. Ors. But how? how proved? Cos. By her own letter,â A fair confession, written outâI saw itâ In her own hand. A maid, too,âhonest soul,â Told me the whole,âwho 'd seen their private meetings, O'erheard their plots, and heard them jeer me. Ors. Damn her! For manhood, shame, waste not another sigh On such a cockatrice. Drop on thy knees, And bless the miracle of thine escape. By Janus! he who notâwho scorns notâbans not,â Were fitter to squeak treble to a choir, Be doorkeeper to a harem, shaveling monk, Than to enroll himself with noble men, And belt the warrior's glaive. Cos. Thou know'st not what it is;â O! that I couldâcurse,âhate her,âcast her off;â But ah! she circles in the vital stream That nourishes my heart: life stops without her. Ors. Forbear! this sorceress has bewitched thee, Cosmo. Think, what must follow such unmanly yielding: This feebleness will tarnish every laurel, Destroy thy peace for ever. Cos. O, I know it. Why tell of that?âThink'st thou I hope for peace? Thou dost not feel,âthou canst not understand me. Ors. Indeed, I feel; but as a soldier oughtâ Cos. (starting suddenly and grasping Orsini.) She 's there! she 's there! (The lattice of Demetria's window uncloses, and, by the light burning within, she is seen before it. Cosmo watches her with breathless emotion, holding Orsini fast. In a few moments she retires, then reappears with her lute, and touches a melancholy air. Cosmo hides his face on Orsini's shoulder.) O, heavens! the same,âthe very same! Ors. Beware! she hears thee. (Alarmed by their voices, Demetria looks towards the spot where they stand; closes the lattice and retires.) Cos. The notes she struck the night I first beheld her!â Both children.âLittle, little I imaginedâ O! that mine eyes had never seen her! Ors. Gods! If wishing would avail, I would wish too. Cos. From that same hour I loved her, watched her spread Into the matchless thing I left her.âCurse Ambition! curse on glory! cursed be all That made me leave her. Had I been wise and watchful, She had been spotless, I too happy! Nowâ O! Carlo, Carlo! what does this drear world Contain for me?âAh! yes, one joy awaits me;â I'm to be married,âmarried to another. Ors. Come, come, let 's not stay here all night. Cos. What subtle fiend contrived this crown to misery? I might have dreamed upon her,âmight have hoped;â Now, I'm to plunge lower than Erebus, Deeper than hell, where not a dungeon glimmer Can cleave the solid darkness. O! that Honor Did not confront meâtyrant!âwell I knowâ I 'd not stand shivering on the brinkâ Ors. O, foul! What, win her? fix the day? almost espouse her, And then desert? Cos. Orsini, till this hour, I 've kept the path of honor. Need I now Thy counsel to sustain me?âThere it is,â That idol chains me.âWere my fate but once Mine own, I knowâ Ors. It grieves me, dearest Cosmo,â Cos. Am not I, now, the veriest slave?âThe blow, The only blow that can emancipate, Annihilates mine honor? Ors. Give o'er such thoughts. Cos. Leave me, Orsini. It is mockery To stuff my ears with womanish condolence. Am I not capable to scan my fate With eyes as keen as thine? Point me a straw, A gossamer, to snatch at,âany way To scape this pit of horrorsâCanst thou?â Away, then!âLeave me to my solitude. Ors. No, Cosmo, thou art mad with sorrow. Clouds, too, Are gatheringâ Cos. Honest Carlo, prithee leave me. Dost apprehend violence upon myself? Look!âhere 's my dagger,âtake it. On my soul I 've now no weapon.âOnly leave me. Ors. Ah!â Is this a place, or hour, for meditation? Come, Cosmo, come; return with me to shelter. (Takes hold of him.) Cos. (grasping Orsini.) Must I be penned in corners? watched? schooled? bayed? Lose my last privilege?âBack!âI warn thee!âBack! Follow me not. (Thrusts Orsini from him, and exit down the garden.) Ors. (looking after him.) 'T is mockery, indeed.âHis passion swells Beyond all governance. I could weep too.â Must this go on?âIs there no remedy?â How if his uncle should step in?âWere 't best?â But who can break with him?âI dare not do it:â First, being but a stranger; then my friend Would hold himself dishonored and betrayed.â I fear he is undone!âMost fatal rashness!â Poor wretch!âI dare not leave him out all night. Here, in this arbour, I will watch awhile. (Retires.) ACT V. SCENE I. A magnificent saloon, illuminated with festive splendor: crowds of cavaliers and ladies engaged in conversation, or dancing, or walking about. The family of BelvederÃ© dispersed among the company. Orsini aloof, in observation. Ors. Pray Heaven, good come of it!âPoor thing! This wrings her soul. I see it; and 't is strange!â Is that a face of cunning?âCan a look Of bosomed grief like that conceal a heart So black? (Gazing round.) Tinsel! all tinsel to pure gold! Never saw I the form of loveliness So near angelic, beauty exquisite As Guido's dreams. Well might he wail her loss; If no foul play,âwhich I indeed suspect. (A cavalier approaches Orsini, who turns away to avoid him.) Cavalier. (accosting him.) Signor, a splendid company. Ors. Truly, my lord. Cav. Have you been long from Pisa? Ors. No, my lord. Cav. What lady is 't that sits aloneâjust thereâ Beneath the brilliant?âpale,âwith a handkerchief,â Left of the Cardinal and friar,âdressed In Padua green, bordered with silver? Thereâ D' ye see her, Sir?âa chaplet of white flowers? Ors. 'T is the Count's youngest daughter. Cav. Ah! is it she?âthe Dian BelvederÃ©? For so admiring Florence calls her. Faith! The huntress Queen need shine her brightest.âSignor, Methinks this revelry displeases her. Ors. Why so? Cav. Observe her but a little: I have marked her.â While Cosmo and his bride knelt in the chapel, A shudder seemed to pass across her; drops, Great drops, not tears, stood on her face: she looked Like sculptured agony. Remarked you not? Ors. I stood more distant,âwatched less heedfully. Cav. Nay, 't was apparent. Ors. Parting with her sister,â The touching ceremony,âthese might move her. Adieu, my lord. (Bows and disappears in the crowd.) Cav. Truly; but scarce to such a fixed woe. De' Medici! 2d Cav. (turning.) Ha, Alighieri! 1st Cav. Know you that lady? 2d Cav. Which? in white? 1st Cav. The next. 2d Cav. O!â That 's a divinity. 1st Cav. But by what title may she be invoked? 2d Cav. Her sect adores her under ten or twenty; As Daphne, Dian, Lucrece, La Madonna, White Rose of Loveliness.âWhy, know you not The darling of the name Amerigo? Enchanting, sweet, and gentle as the maids Vespucci tells of, Eves of his new world, That, plumed and garlanded, sing all day long Under the nodding palm-trees? 1st Cav. Pray present me. 2d Cav. Not know her? 1st Cav. No, in faith. 2d Cav. Come, then;âwhy, she 's the fairest star o' the night. (They move to the side where Demetria sits. Cosmo passes slowly by.) Cos. Dearly she 's paid the price!âNow, God! let loose The elements!âStorm! wrack! make all like this Fell bosom!âCurse the tumult!âTwenty thousand Torches seem stuck about my brain!âHa! who 's that?â (Seeing the two cavaliers address Demetria, advances towards them. Folding doors are flung open; discovering a suit of apartments brilliantly lighted for the banquet. A grand symphony strikes up, and the company pass through.) SCENE II. Demetria's chamber. A neglected lamp burning on the table: the room gloomy and silent, except at intervals the sound of music and merriment from the apartments below. Demetria enters, throws herself into a chair, and sits, for some time, as if gazing at the light. Dem. 'T is past!âMine eyes have seen it!âWhat is left For me?âThe power of Heaven cannot recall it!â 'T is registered in that Eternal Book Where all irrevocable things are written!â Those timbrels mock me.âWould, I could not hear them!â (Looking round the room.) Dark, dark!âlike my destiny!âMy spring-time Passed swiftly,âsweet as transitory!âAlready The frosts of autumn gather hoar around!â The sear leaf falls.âI had a mother,âshe Moulders beneath the sod:âa loverâHark!â How their bursts of merriment shake the roof! Now, now, The bridegroom pledges! now the smile illumes A thousand eyes, a thousand tongues repeat The plaudit!âPoor Demetria! who thinks of thee? Darkness may cover thee, storms beat on thee, And none regards it:âsorrow finds no heart-room. (After a short silence, convulsed by one or two deep sobs, she rises.) Hail! then, thou lowly bed! where sighing is hushed, Where love comes not, and grief forgets to feel! Chambers of everlasting stillness! there I'll lay me.âMother! mother! we will sleep Together!â(Goes hastily into her boudoir; whence, after a few moments, she returns, trembling, and mortally pale.) I 've pledged thee, Cosmo!âNow the seal is set!â And I am plighted to a grimmer bridegroom! Soon, soon, I shall be wedded too!âLet none Judge harshly of me!âO! I could have borne The direst accidents of fortune;âseen Every dear friend fall off;âbeen left alone In this wide world, and waited patiently The hour appointed. But to be despised,â A cast-off by the heart thou lovest,âthere, There 's the insufferable pang! (Rings.) Will this affect him? this becloud his triumph? (Enters the inner room again, and returns with her hat and mantle.) Father!âthat I could say farewell to thee!â May angels comfort thee when I am gone! (Rings again and goes to the window.) The moon withdraws her face, and scarce a star Looks out to cheer me. (Still gazing.) Beyond your shining spheres Far, far, must I explore!âO! that I knew The place, the Paradise where she inhabits, And could attain it!âWho shall guide? or what Assurance have Iâ Enter Bianca, who starts back on seeing Demetria. Bian. Jesu defend us!âWhither art thou going?â I thought thee at the banquet.âWhere art going?â Dem. To walk. Bian. Walk! at this hour? alone? What mean ye?âFor Heaven's sake tell me. Dem. Hear me, Bianca,â Bian. Give me thy mantle, child. Thou 'rt pale: thine eyes Roll wildlyâ Dem. Hear, Bianca.âWhen I'm gone, Be sure you lay me near her side. Bian. (terrified.) She raves!â What means my darling child?âGone where? Dem. Dost hear me?â When I'm away,âyou then may tell him.â Say to my fatherâsayâI prayedâI blessed him. Bian. (falling on her knees and clasping her.) Stay! stay! my gracious ladyâ't is dark night! O, whither wouldst thou?âThis is frantic madness. Dem. (with a desperate calmness.) Unclasp your hold.âI am not mad.âObey me. In the pavilion you will find me. (Exit.) Bian. She 's crazed!â Go forth at such a time!âHow strange she looked! How hollow-toned! She waxes desperate, And may be tempted to some dreadful act. (Exit in terror.) SCENE III. An apartment communicating with the suit of rooms terminating in the saloon; where the company is again assembled. The noise of revelry heard, and the dancers seen at a distance passing quickly to and fro. Bianca and a Servant enter from an opposite direction. Bian. Call Signor Cosmo!âFly!âBid him be instant! (Exit Servant towards the saloon.) It has undone her.âIt shall go no further,â O, precious child!âThe saints watch over thee!â Mother of Jesu! guard her life, beseech ye! (Enter Cosmo from the saloon.) So thenâyou 've murdered her!âFalse! treacherous!â You 've killed my sweetest lady!âShame eternal!â Cos. What!âmurdered!âwho? Bian. You 've broke her heartâ Curse on such cruelty! Judgment, I hope, Will overtake it. Cos. Hag, what mean'st thou? Bian. Ask Your conscience!âor 's that seared?âMy child, My sweetest lady,âpoor Demetriaâ Cos. What of her? Bian. She 's gone distracted. Cos. (starting.) Distracted!âwho?âwhere is she? Bian. Shame! Shame! shame! you wooed her, won her gentle heart; Forsook her basely;âmarried with her sister. Cos. I did; for she was false. Bian. (violently.) False! who was false? Cos. Ay,âshe betrayed me. Bian. Palsied be the tongue That calls her false! She was as true as angels! If you dare call her falseâ Cos. I know itâI can prove itâhave the letter. Bian. What letter? Cos. Yes, to Barbadeca. Bian. Letter! Barbadeca!âHorrors! Whence came it? Tell me truly, I conjure thee. Cos. From Jacquelina:âshe detected them: She knowsâhas seen their meetings. Bian. (staggering backwards.) Quick and dead! 'T is so!ânow, now, the dreadful light breaks in! O, fool, fool, fool!âand you, for this, forsook her? Cos. Yes; was it not a reason? Bian. A reason! O, sweet heavens, a reason!â I say she loves you,âever has adored you;â O! that I 'd spoken!âall the while I thought, I thought some hellish fraud was at the bottom. Cos. For God's sake speak:âtorture me not:â Why think ye that she loves me? on what proof? Bian. Hear briefly, Signor.âIf I warp the truth, Forked lightnings end me. You have been tricked, deceived, Most vilely tricked. That letterâwhat it is, I know not; but if in ought it implicate Or charge Demetria, 't is as false as hell, In whose abyss 't was forged. For I can swearâ Anon I'll give you proofâhow true she was. Two nights, I 've heard that serpent who deceived thee, Muttering in sleep. She named this Barbadeca, As if, with her, in some deep villany Compacted; groaned, and tossed, like one in torments. Last night, she cursed him; oft invoked Demetria; Talked of a trunk down somewhere, and a letter; And cried: âO! spare me! O! he set me on!â Cos. Merciful Heaven! Bian. Your name she uttered, twice Or thrice; and mumbled of the coming marriage. There 's foulest treachery somewhere:âshe is deep in 't.â But, as I hope for masses for my soul, So sure, my lord, she loved you to her heart's core. Last night, I came upon her all alone, Talking, and weeping, to her mother's picture:â Most bitterly she took your altered vows, And her abandonment. Cos. Earth, swallow me! Bian. I forced her to commune, and did implore Leave to inquire if any slanderous tale Had thus estranged you; but with adjurations, And, as I loved her honor, she forbade me. Cos. Undone!âWhere is she? Bian. Now, this very moment, I found her in her chamber, nigh distraught. She bade me with a strange solemnity To lay her near her mother. Other charges She sadly left with me. Follow her, Signor: Some desperate purposeâ Cos. Follow! where is she? Bian. Gone wandering forth alone, toward the pavilion. I begged her on my kneesâ (Cosmo rushes out.) Well may ye falter!âO, that I had spoken!â O, that I had disregarded!âTwice I rose To seek him, but her solemn charge withheld me.â It would have saved a noble house from ruin!â Where be my lord the Count?âAlack! alack! (Exit into the saloon.) SCENE IV. The wood: the villa seen across the grounds, blazing with lights: Demetria enters, her hair loose and flying. Dem. She pities me,âshe sheds a watery gleam,â And the wind moansâOnce more, once moreâ (Stops, and fixes her eyes, with a long and steadfast gaze, on the mansion.) Happy!âtoo happy, once!âNow I must leave ye,â Dear natal bowers!âRemembered joys!âye rise,â Ye swell my heart!âI scarce can look my lastâ How proud the symphony!âHow the light turns Everything to enchantment!âThere 's her chamber!â The torches glitter thereâWhy linger? wherefore?âWhyâ (Turning away.) My hour is come! Dark bridegroom, take me now! (Exit.) SCENE V. The pavilion. Demetria appears from the wood; totters into it, and sinks upon a seat. Dem. I feel itâshooting through my heart:âthe hand Of death is on me. Now, the parting comes.â 'T is dismal!âWould I had some friend to cheer me;â Some kindly breast to lay my head upon!â To dieâaloneâ (Suddenly clasping her hands.) âThat 's not the worst! O! mother, intercede!âgo prostrate!âplead! Wrestle, ah! wrestle for me, mother!âClasp Her feet, And say I could have borne aught, aught but this!â Thou mayst prevailâthou mayst embrace me yet!â O, hear'st thou?âGive some signâDear mother, Whisper me! breathe upon me!âO! some sign!â Alas! alas! all things are silent!âHa! Who 's here? (Cosmo throws himself at her feet, unable to speak.) Whom do you seek for here, my lord? Cos. I'm come to grovel here for pardon. Canst thou Forgive a wretch like me? Demetria,âOh! I've wronged thee,âinjured thee past all forgiveness,â But never yet have been so cursed as not To love thee. Dem. Rise, my lord, and leave this place. Cos. Never, no never, never will I quit Thy feet, till thou hast sealed my pardon. Love, We 've been undone by fiendish treachery! The Foe of all has twined me in his snare;â That moment, when I vowed to love another, My soul clung to thee,âclung in agony. Not for one breath, one heart-beat, have I ceased To love thee. Canst thou, spotless Purity, Pardon my sin, in giving ear to slanders? Dem. Ha, Cosmo! hast thou foundered on that rock? Cos. O, 't was so subtly laid! Fool! fool! I knew, I might have known, that angels sin not. Yet, So cunninglyâI sought to rend the toils, But could not. O! Demetria, canst thou, wronged So cruelly, forgive the wretched Cosmo? Dem. I know not whom I 've injured?âWho could fix A stain upon me? Cos. The child of hell that tends Thy sister, mastered me by some strong spell: Made me believe your heart was Barbadeca's, And I but trifled with, to veil your passion. Dem. Heavenly powers!âO, Cosmo, Cosmo!â How couldst thou credit such a tale?âmy heart!â Mine?âBarbadeca's?âO, how couldst thou? Cos. Fiends, fiends, With hellish potions overcame my reason. 'T is done,â't is past,âmy peace is justly wrecked!â Forgive me, matchless Innocence; then cast Me from remembrance: never think again On one so damned. Dem. Take my pardon, Cosmo; Would it were healing, as 't is freely given. I fain would hear the mournful story; know What frauds can so have wrought upon thy nature, Upright and noble as I know it is.â But 't is too late.âMy Cosmo, we must part,â Death's finger is upon me. Cos. (recoiling.) Thou hast not!â Dem. Ah! Cosmo!âsorrows pressed so heavilyâ Weak and aloneâmy constancy gave wayâ I thought in one oblivious draughtâ Cos. So then, I 've murdered thee! O, horror! horror! where Is there a depth, dark as my reprobation? Dem. Don't blame thyself so bitterly, my Cosmo, Because an evil star has crossed us here. Perhaps, hereafter, we may meet in peace, There, where the tongue of slander never stings, Where no malicious fate can part us. Cos. Neverâ Never!âHope not for me. Dem. Would thou couldst feel The peace, the bliss that settles at my soul!â But now, disconsolate, alone, I thought To breathe my spirit out, as in the desert; Nought looked upon me but the silent heavens; No voice bemoaned me but the passing wind. Now, reconciled love is near me; hope And joy spring in my bosom. Hear'st thou not Music?âA sign some blessed one hovers near, Commissioned to receive me. Cos. Must we partâ So newly metâThou nothing know'stânot half, Not half the love that agonizes here! Dem. Come near me, Cosmo:âlet me lean upon thee:â Nearer:âI 've loved thee long, and tenderly;â I love thee still,âand never while this soul Partakes of being, will thy virtues cease Their influence o'er me. Whether it be my lot To chant with white-stoled sisters, or to weep An outcast, never shall I, can I, cease To love thee. Let that soothe thine anguish. Now, In this last solemn hour, the sharpest pang I feel, is thus to leave thee here behind me Afflicted and alone. For I had thought To tread life's path beside thee, thought to shareâ It cannot beâI feel it hereâa grasp, Like ice, benumbs me. Cosmo, let my prayer Prevail.âWaste not thy life in useless sorrow:â Be comfortedâand cheerâmy father. Cos. Comforted!â Dem. (in a fainter voice.) Be not deceivedâ O! by our loves,âby every hope, and fear, I charge thee, lift not thy rash hand against Thyself. O! 't is a solemn thingâThat gleam Has faded:âDarkness, dread uncertainty, Oppress me.âLiveâand pray for my unhappyâ (Her voice dies away.) Cos. Thou 'rt sinkingâdying!âO, for words,âutterance,â LovedâlovedâO, I amâI cannotâ Dem. (her head resting on his bosom.) Ah, Cosmo! I have much to tell thee tooâ Moreâmany!âtender legaciesâI 'd leave theeâ But shadows swim before meâshadowsâ (Dies.) Cos. (for some time motionless.) Still?âDead?âHer heart beats not!âYesâNoâ Her pulseâAll 's stopped! Dead! dead! I clasp her clay! O sacrificed, O murdered angel!âThis, This is thy recompense!âHave I bereft Those eyes of lustre? I broken that fond heart?â What anguish must have driven her?âO, the pangs The pangs her spirit suffered!âThief! wretch! caitiff!â I am too hateful!âGentle, slaughtered angel! One kissâwhile life's perfume is on thy lipsâ (Kisses her: gazes on her awhile: kisses her again.) I ask no more than to partake thy lot! (Stabs himself and sinks by her side.) HADAD, A DRAMATIC POEM. TO THE VENERABLE ABRAHAM BEACH, D. D., AS A TESTIMONY OF AFFECTION, THIS WORK IS RESPECTFULLY DEDICATED. INTRODUCTION. The peculiar feature of this poem is ascribable to the Book of Tobit, where the supernatural throws a mystical wildness over a touching narrative of human interests. A legend in the Talmud, also, mentions the appearance in Jerusalem, not far from the date here assigned him, of the most remarkable of our dramatis personÃ¦. The belief in a former intercourse between mankind, and the good and evil beings of the Spiritual World, harmonizes with the solemn twilight of the scriptural ages, and is sustained by many declarations of Holy Writ. The passages reciting the necromantic power of the Sorceress of Endor, the passion and discomfiture of the Spirit who was enamoured of the daughter of Raguel, and the Demonian possessions of a later period,âas explained by most commentators, supported by the common faith of the Christian world,âare simple narrations of actual occurrences. Dr. Clarke affirms, that to every unprejudiced reader of the Sacred Writings, it is evident they represent those who dealt with Familiar Spirits, âas actually possessing a power to evoke the dead, to perform supernatural operations, and to discover hidden and secret things, by spells, charms, incantations, &amp;c.â Adam Clarke, note on Exod. xxii. 18. Dr. Gray, in his observations on the Book of Tobit, which he considers as entitled to the credit of an authentic historical narrative, remarks: âWith respect to the agency of Angels, there is nothing inconsistent with reason, received opinions, or Scripture, in supposing a limited superintendence of Superior Beings. We know, indeed, that, under the peculiar circumstances of the Jewish economy, the ministry of Angels was manifestly employed, in subserviency to God's designs; and that particular personages were occasionally favored with their familiar intercourse. It is likewise unquestionable, that, before the power and malevolence of Evil Spirits were checked and restricted by the control of our Saviour, their open influence was experienced.ââThus understood, the Scriptures offer scenes of unrivalled wildness and sublimity; agents, whose power and attributes are of unknown extent, who connect, on the authority of our Faith, the visible with the invisible world. The particular epoch signalized by the rebellion of Absalom, is familiar to all. The simple manners which prevailed in Israel previously to the kingly government, and even during the life of Saul, had disappeared. Accelerated by the extensive conquests and the amazing wealth of David, history declares the dawn of that luxury to have become manifest, which advanced, in the reign of his successor, to a proverbial height of splendor. Perhaps it may be as well to remind the reader, that Absalom, having avenged his sister by the death of his half-brother Ammon, fled to the court of his maternal grandfather, Talmai, king of Geshur, a principality in the neighbourhood of Damascus. At the expiration of three years, David was persuaded to recall him to Jerusalem, but refused, during two years more, to admit him into his presence. Being, at last, entirely restored to favor, he began to display a pomp characteristic of his haughty and magnificent spirit. He âprepared him chariots, and horses, and fifty men to run before him,â and commenced a system of popular arts, which, rendered effective by his extraordinary personal beauty, and, probably enough, by his talents and achievements, seduced the affections of a great part of the nation from their venerable king. Though, under the severer light of Sacred History, this Achilles, or Alcibiades, of the Hebrews is regarded with a sort of prescriptive horror, his crime was no other than that for which CÅur de Lion, and many other favorites of history and romance stand accountable. David's vehement attachment proves him to have been not destitute of virtues, and they may naturally be supposed to have been of the heroic kind. Of his beautiful daughter we know no more, than that her personal attractions were thought worthy of mention by the sacred historian. Hadad was the name of the contemporary sovereigns of Damascus. Nicholas of Damascus relates, that, after many battles, David signally defeated one of them near the Euphrates, together with Hadadezer, another Syrian monarch, whom he was attempting to succour; and adds, that the succeeding kings of Damascus took the name of Hadad.

Young Syrian, he becomes that title better Who, midst his sons and captains, feasts, to-day, Envoys from proudest nations; tyrant Egypt, Elam, and Tyre, Assyria, and Damascus, Dusk princes from the east, and unknown south; All bearing to his coffers richest gifts, Fuming his pride with incense, courting league And amity with him, whose warlike name Even Ishmael's roving sons respect and fear. Had. Dost thouâthou, whose illustrious grandsire wore The crown of Israel, when young David's brows Were wreathed with oak-leaves in the wilderness, Renounce thy lineage, title, thy great name, Because thou lack'st the chair and canopy?â Prince, in that unseen chamber where the Soul Sits shrouded with her winged ministry, Swifter than light and countless as the stars,â High aims, proud thoughts, inflexible resolves, And hopes that reach at glory, there is fixed The seat of Majesty. Mephib. O, thoughts like these May grace the lips, but thou wilt live to find Power is the seat of Majesty. Had. When clouds Lowered black as midnight o'er his head, who, now, Thinks nought can intercept the sun, and deems His throne immovable as holy Zion, What had his heart to lean on in the hour Of peril, but an old man's prophecy?â Less stable, Prince, than lineal rights like thine.â But to that golden prophecy he clung, Revolved it waking, slept to dream it o'er, Drew from it hope, and constancy, and courage; Else, had some cavern been his dwelling still, And not these roofs of cedar. Mephib. Hadad,ânoâ Thou 'rt not so wild, to deem the abject wretch Mephibosheth presumes to think of rights? Had. Glimmers thy natal star more dim than mine? Am not I here an hostage, poor, and powerless, Condemned to exile on the false pretence Of Syria's broken faith? destined, perhaps, To fill some Hebrew dungeon, while a son Of David sways the sceptre of Damascus? Yet, singly here upon his wall-girt hill, I feel, and will assert, my claims, as proudly As in the halls of Hadad. Mephib. Different far Thy fate and mine.âThy race survives:âa throne Awaits thee. Seated there, thou mayst restore, Avenge its greatness. I, alas! a cripple,â (Wrecked doubly on that fatal Gilboa,â) what Can I, but weep and curse?âCut off from action, Like a dull Levite, I consume my life O'er chronicles that teach me what I 've lost:â Or in some niche of theseâmy master's hallsâ Observe their ways and comment. Had. Rare! O, rare! Slayings and prayings!âpsalmody and love!â War cries and canticles!âwassail and sackcloth!â Groanings, and making groan the bleeding nations! Mephib. In the primeval day, the friends of God Dwelt in plain tents, or underneath some tree; But see how this Prince-prophet builds his nest. Mark yonder pavement, like a limpid lake, Reflecting all things from its polished face; Behold yon couches, wrought like kingly thrones With gold and ivory; those Tyrian hangings, Garnished, and enter-tissued, till they mock The very tabernacle. Breathe the perfume From yonder bossy censers, sending up A silvery volume to the vaulted roof;â There the lign-aloes wastes its precious sweets, Costlier than Ophir's dust. Look at his meats, His wines, the service of his table; youths About his cup fairer than Tammuz. See His wives, his concubines, whose annual waste Employs the looms of Egypt, whose dove necks Glitter with gems that might redeem a kingdom. Had. Types, types of Paradise, my lord, Whose pleasures strain, so oft, his poet fancy! Mephib. Nor is this all; his sons outstrip their sire In every wild device of luxury. Poor Israel sweats to pamper their blown pride, Which, swollen and rank, breaks out, anon, in lust And murder. Never was a land so cursed, So trampled!âSee the red-hand Absalom!â Is there a demi-god in Syria's temples A juster image of tyrannic pride?â Not Pharaoh's chariot prouder grinds the way, Or makes the dwelling of Osiris tremble As his audacious wheels the mercy-seat! His haughty spirit lightens in his eye, That, eagle-like, seems fixed on some far quarry: His Babylonish mantle, wrought with stars, And golden characters of strange device, Flames like a constellation; and the hoop, Half seen upon his brows, denotes a will, That, if it dared, would make a white head crownless. Had. Interpret not so harshly. It denotes But David's heir, the eldest, noblest-born, Bravest, and most illustrious son of Israel. Mephib. Ho!âby whose blood became he so? Had. By blood which, had I shed in such a cause, I ne'er had washed the voucher from my hand. Amnon's. Mephib. But Daniel tooâ Is he despatched? or has he sold his birthright? Had. Ere he essay to curb this fiery people, Send him to still the bellowing oaks of Bashan. Mephib. But, prithee, how know'st thou, or Absalom, That Adonijah, who, in valiant parts, Scarce yields to him the palm, and far outshines In peaceful virtues and unblemished fame, May not be chosen?âay, or Solomon, Old Nathan's darling, son of David's age, Cherished like Joseph, whose ripe boyhood yields The promise of a mind that after times Will wonder at? The King was Jesse's youngest, And matched young Solomon in looks and years, When Samuel passed seven stately sons, to crown The shepherd boy.âWhy dost thou fix thine eyes, As thou wouldst rend the secrets from my soul? Had. But hast thou heardâor noted aught like this? Mephib. Prince of Damascus, what is that to thee? If Saul and David, or if David's sons Dispute the throne, hath Syria aught to say? Had. Nay, Prince, I meant butâ Mephib. Meant to draw forth that Which Absalom, thy kinsman, burns to know; Thy more than kinsmanâbeauteous Tamar's sire! Tell him, Mephibosheth nor hears, nor sees, Nor hath, in these fair seeming days, a tongue. Slaves, to mine arbour. (Mephibosheth is borne out.) Had. He harps the fatal note,âyoung Solomon,â The scorpion of the brood, whose sting shall prove Mortal to other than his foes.â(Listens.) The step Is Absalom'sâ't is heâand opportunely. Enter Absalom. Ab. Hadad, thine uncle's envoys sup with me, In private, with the Tyrian: go, I prithee, And bid those chiefs of Issachar, whose cause Sped ill this morning. Say Ahithophel, Who friended them in council, meets with us.â But wherefore meditatest thou here alone? Had. The son of Jonathan just parted from me. Being next him at the table, I refreshed His cup so oft, and spiced it so with vaunts Of Judah's glory, (subtler than the wine To work on Benjamin,) that in a rage He flung from me to cool his ferment here. I followed, as unconscious of offence, In hopes his drink or passion might let fall Something of import to you. Ab. Dropped he aught? Had. An ominous hint or two. Ab. As how? Had. Discoursing of the King, his power, and glory, I mentioned you as his undoubted heir. He eyed me with a look askance, implying More than his words, and craved to know why you, Or I, thought that,âcommended Adonijah,â Then, with a smile of dark, malignant joy Which lighted up his murky eye, exclaimed, âWhy not the younger?ânature's prodigy,â Son of old age,âthe Prophet's favorite! What! did not Samuel consecrate a child?â Ab. Malicious slave! He sees what, like a barbed And venomed shaft, hath rankled in me long. The Seer and Joab plot against me. Had. But think you that the King gives ear to them? Ab. I would not wrong my father.âHe hath been Gracious to me and constant, and hath shown Tokens of love I cannot lightly bury. Had. But did you note, my lord, The homage shown the boy before the envoys? How they discoursed with him? what costly gifts, Caresses, flattery, they heaped upon him? Or watch the workings of your father's face, When the old Chaldee lifted up his hands In wonder at his answers?âHad he been Israel's sole hope, they could not more have graced him. Ab. Was it so marked? Had. Nay ask; for others saw it, And smiled, and spoke aside. And sure, my lord, The son of Bathsheba receives, of late, Nicer observance, winged obedience, Obsequious homage, (most observable In those about the court who love not us,) And the old Prophet watches him as close As if some evil Spirit lurked to snare The precious child of heaven, and heir of Israel. Ab. Would heaven, or hell, or any place but this, Contained the basilisk! Had. Ha! look!â Enter Nathan. âthe hoary root of mischief comes.â Let us retire to safer conference:â Spies are about us:âstay not to accost him.â (Exeunt Absalom and Hadad.) Nath. Why doth that Syrian shun me? Always thus He, like a guilty thing, avoids my presence. Where'er I find him,âand I find him ever Closely conferring, whether in the streets, Or gates, or chief resorts,âif I appear, His bright, mysterious eye seems conscious of me, And soon he vanishes. I touched him once. He turned, as he had felt a scorpion; fear And loathing glared from his enkindled orbs, And paleness overspread his face, like one Who smothers mortal pain. Fierce, subtle, dark, Designing, and inscrutable, he walks Among us like an evil Angel. (Passes on.) SCENE II. The King's private apartment. King David alone. Enter Nathan. Nath. God save the Anointed! K. Dav. Seer, we would thy counsel. Damascus asks a consort for his heir, Our hostage, here, and names the flower of Israel, Absalom's daughter. What shall we reply? Nath. Should Israel graft upon a heathen stock? K. Dav. But 't is a noble youth, and near of kin; And sure the gentle maiden favors him, For Absalom himself preferred the suit, Who lives in Tamar. Nath. Hearken not, O King. K. Dav. But if the youth conform to Moses, sure, His blood and fortunes may aspire so high. What nobler line than Hadad's, or what throne Of older splendor than Damascus'? Nath. Old, and idolatrous. K. Dav. Her idols fall If she be linked with us, and Israel's crown Secures a warlike power as her ally. Nath. Rather betroth her to the poorest hind That toils in Judah. K. Dav. Prophet of the Lord, Seest thou aught more in him than we discern,â A young prince modelled in the rarest mould Of mind and features?âNe'er have I beheld, Save my son Absalom's, a goodlier form, Or mind of brighter lustre. Nath. I have felt Strange agitations in his presence,âthroes, And horrid workings,âlike the inward strife After dark visions,âwhen the spectral forms That lodge and haunt there, turmoil all my soul.â Some mysteryâsome strange antipathy Torments me with abhorrence and distrust.â Let not his beauty or his tongue entice thee: He hath an eye bright as the morning star, But pride, and fiendlike cunning, glance from it, And sin is couched in his lascivious smile. K. Dav. If intimations visit thee from Heaven, We owe obedience, else, as man to man, We speak.âHis daughter's welfare I would leave To Absalom. He hath a mind mature, Is politic to judge, and loves the maid Even to her rich deservings. They best know Their Syrian kinsman, long beneath their roof. Nath. Hath she escaped Syria's foul rites, to yield, Even in the precincts of the sanctuary, To an uncircumcised, the heart where faith Glowed like the burning censer!âO, beware Of crafty policy! It wears a face Too like ambition. Geshur cleaves to him,â League but Damascusâwith his power in Israelâ And Absalom may bend his father's bow. K. Dav. Wrong not my son. Nath. I would not; but I fear The sin of Lucifer hath snared his heart!â Say why such state attends him?âwhy he rides In a proud chariot drawn by fiery steeds, While Israel's monarch sits upon a mule?â Why dazzling guards surround him?âWhy he still Stands in the gates saluting all who pass, And greeting in the streets the common people, As they were brothers? True humilityâ K. Dav. You misinterpret venial thingsâ Nath. He doth insult the throne, and take from age, And royalty, their reverence. K. Dav. You love him not, and ever strained his faults. Nath. Why are the Chiefs and Princes of the Tribes, Who come to solemnize our holy feasts, Caressed about his table till they deem The crown upon his brows?âYour chiefest men, Ancients, and reverend Judges, flock to hear His Syrian Parasite sweeten their cups With honeyed flattery, and golden hopes, And promises of days when Absalom Shall make the desert blossom, and the rock Drop as the vine and olive. K. Dav. Days like these Were welcome, Seer. Nath. You know not what you utter;â Woe to the hour of his anointing!âKing! A dreadful vintage shall be trod that day, With purple garments!âLo! the noise of arms, Chariots, and horsemen, and the shout of Nations, Are in my ears!âthe wail of Zion!âHark! A cry, a cry, comes from her royal towers, Of bitter anguish, like a Monarch's voice! My Son! my People! Woe, alas! K. Dav. Say on,â Heaven's will is ours. Nath. 'T is goneâ It passed me, like a cloud of blood, with sounds Confused, like battle. K. Dav. (after a pause.) Nought from thy hallowed lips Falls unrespected. He who changed yon crook For Israel's sceptre, may refuse, or grant, The same to Absalom. His will be done!â But, Man of God, I harbour no distrust. Familiar with the pomp of older kingdoms, My son but antedates the day of Israel. He, ever, loved the ornaments of life, Arms and the glistering face of war, and bore Himself, from his most tender years, like one Conscious of nobleness, born to sustain A kingdom's burden. Nath. Son of Jesse,â K. Dav. What! hath he not, since fourteen summers old, Served with me in the field, slept in my tent, Hungered, and suffered, watched, and toiled with me; Shed his young blood by veteran captains' sides, And wielded those bright weapons you dispraise Beneath mine eyes, in dire and mutual hazards, Like a true son and soldier? Nath. Son of Jesse,â K. Dav. (waving his hand) 'T is near the hour of sacrifice. We'll pause ere we decide the Syrian's suit. Nath. (making obeisance.) Dwell, ever, in the hollow of His hand! (Exit Nathan. King David retires into his cloest.) SCENE III. The garden of Absalom's house on Mount Zion, near the palace, overlooking the city. Tamar sitting by a fountain. Tam. How aromatic evening grows! The flowers And spicy shrubs exhale like onycha; Spikenard and henna emulate in sweets. Blest hour! which He, who fashioned it so fair, So softly glowing, so contemplative, Hath set, and sanctified to look on man. And lo! the smoke of evening sacrifice Ascends from out the tabernacle.âHeaven, Accept the expiation, and forgive This day's offences!âHa! the wonted strain, Precursor of his coming!âWhence can thisâ It seems to flow from some unearthly handâ Enter Hadad. Had. Does beauteous Tamar view, in this clear fount, Herself, or heaven? Tam. Nay, Hadad, tell me whence Those sad, mysterious sounds. Had. What sounds, dear Princess? Tam. Surely, thou know'st; and now I almost think Some spiritual creature waits on thee. Had. I heard no sounds, but such as evening sends Up from the city to these quiet shades; A blended murmur sweetly harmonizing With flowing fountains, feathered minstrelsy, And voices from the hills. Tam. The sounds I mean, Floated like mournful music round my head, From unseen fingers. Had. When? Tam. Now, as thou camest. Had. 'T is but thy fancy, wrought To ecstasy; or else thy grandsire's harp Resounding from his tower at eventide. I 've lingered to enjoy its solemn tones, Till the broad moon, that rose o'er Olivet, Stood listening in the zenith; yea, have deemed Viols and heavenly voices answered him. Tam. But theseâ Had. Were we in Syria, I might say The Naiad of the fount, or some sweet Nymph, The goddess of these shades, rejoiced in thee, And gave thee salutations; but I fear Judah would call me infidel to Moses. Tam. How like my fancy! When these strains precede Thy steps, as oft they do, I love to think Some gentle being who delights in us Is hovering near, and warns me of thy coming; But they are dirge-like. Had. Youthful fantasy, Attuned to sadness, makes them seem so, lady. So evening's charming voices, welcomed ever, As signs of rest and peace;âthe watchman's call, The closing gates, the Levite's mellow trump Announcing the returning moon, the pipe Of swains, the bleat, the bark, the housing-bell, Send melancholy to a drooping soul. Tam. But how delicious are the pensive dreams That steal upon the fancy at their call! Had. Delicious to behold the world at rest. Meek labor wipes his brow, and intermits The curse, to clasp the younglings of his cot; Herdsmen and shepherds fold their flocks,âand hark! What merry strains they send from Olivet! The jar of life is still; the city speaks In gentle murmurs; voices chime with lutes Waked in the streets and gardens; loving pairs Eye the red west in one another's arms; And nature, breathing dew and fragrance, yields A glimpse of happiness, which He, who formed Earth and the stars, had power to make eternal. Tam. Ah! Hadad, meanest thou to reproach the Friend Who gave so much, because he gave not all? Had. Perfect benevolence, methinks, had willed Unceasing happiness, and peace, and joy; Filled the whole universe of human hearts With pleasure, like a flowing spring of life. Tam. Our Prophet teaches so, till man's rebellion. Had. Rebellion!âHad he leaguered Heaven itself With beings powerful, numberless, and dreadfulâ Mixed onset 'midst the lacerating hail, And snake-tongued thunderbolts, that hissed and stung Worse than eruptive mountains,âthis had fallen Within the category.âBut what did man?â Tasted an apple! and the fragile scene, Eden, and innocence, and human bliss, The nectar-flowing streams, life-giving fruits, Celestial shades, and amaranthine flowers, Vanish; and sorrow, toil, and pain, and death, Cleave to him by an everlasting curse. Tam. Ah! talk not thus. Had. Is this benevolence?â Nay, loveliest, these things sometimes trouble me; For I was tutored in a brighter faith. Our Syrians deem each lucid fount and stream, Forest and mountain, glade and bosky dell, Peopled with kind divinities, the friends Of man, a spiritual race allied To him by many sympathies, who seek His happiness, inspire him with gay thoughts, Cool with their waves, and fan him with their airs. O'er them, the Spirit of the Universe, Or Soul of Nature, circumfuses all With mild, benevolent, and sun-like radiance; Pervading, warming, vivifying earth, As spirit does the body, till green herbs, And beauteous flowers, and branchy cedars rise; And shooting stellar influence through her caves, Whence minerals and gems imbibe their lustre. Tam. Dreams, Hadad, empty dreams. Had. These Deities They invocate with cheerful, gentle rites, Hang garlands on their altars, heap their shrines With Nature's bounties, fruits, and fragrant flowers. Not like yon gory mount that ever reeksâ Tam. Cast not reproach upon the holy altar. Had. Nay, sweet.âHaving enjoyed all pleasures here That Nature prompts, but chiefly blissful love, At death, the happy Syrian maiden deems Her immaterial flies into the fields, Or circumambient clouds, or crystal brooks, And dwells, a Deity, with those she worshipped; Till time, or fate, return her in its course To quaff, once more, the cup of human joy. Tam. But thou believ'st not this. Had. I almost wish Thou didst; for I have feared, my gentle Tamar, Thy spirit is too tender for a Law Announced in terrors, coupled with the threats Of an inflexible and dreadful Being, Whose word annihilates,âwho could arrest The sun in heaven, or, if he pleased, abolish Light from creation, and leave wretched man To darkness,âas he did to worse, when all His firmamental cataracts came down!â All perished,âyet his purpose faltered not!â His anger never dies, never remits, But unextinguished burns to deepest hell. Jealous, implacableâ Tam. Peace! impious! peace! Had. Ha! says not Moses so? The Lord is jealous. Tam. Jealous of our faith, Our love, our true obedience, justly his; And a poor recompense for all his favors. Implacable he is not; contrite man, Ne'er found him so. Had. But others have, If oracles be true. Tam. Little we know Of them; and nothing of their dire offence. Had. I meant not to displease, love; but my soul Revolts, because I think thy gentle nature Shudders at him and yonder bloody rites. How dreadful! when the world awakes to light, And life, and gladness, and the jocund tide Bounds in the veins of every happy creature, Morning is ushered by a murdered victim, Whose wasting members reek upon the air, Polluting the pure firmament; the shades Of evening scent of death; almost, the shrine Itself, o'ershadowed by the Cherubim; And where the clotted current from the altar Mixes with Kedron, all its waves are gore. Nay, nay, I grieve thee;â't is not for myself, But that I fear these gloomy things oppress Thy soul, and cloud its native sunshine. Tam. (in tears, clasping her hands.) Witness, ye Heavens! Eternal Father, witness! Blest God of Jacob! Maker! Friend! Preserver! That with my heart, my undivided soul, I love, adore, and praise thy glorious name, Confess thee Lord of all, believe thy Laws Wise, just, and merciful, as they are true. O, Hadad, Hadad! you misconstrue much The sadness that usurps me;â't is for thee I grieve,âfor hopes that fade,âfor your lost soul, And my lost happiness. Had. O, say not so, Beloved Princess. Why distrust my faith? Tam. Thou know'st, alas, my weakness; but remember, I never, never will be thine, although The feast, the blessing, and the song were past, Though Absalom and David called me bride, Till sure thou own'st, with truth, and love sincere The Lord Jehovah. Had. Leave me notâHear, hearâ I do believeâI know that Being lives Whom you adore. Ah! stayâby proofs I know Which Moses had not. Tam. Prince, unclasp my hand. (Exit.) Had. Untwine thy fetters if thou canst.âHow sweet To watch the struggling softness! It allays The beating tempest of my thoughts, and flows, Like the nepenthe of Elysium through me. How exquisite! Like subtlest essences, She fills the spirit! How the girdle clips Her taper waist with its resplendent clasp! Her bosom's silvery-swelling network yields Ravishing glimpses, like sweet shade and moonshine Checkering Astarte's statueâ Enter a Slave. Slave. One in haste Inquires for you, my lord. Had. I come. (Exeunt.) ACT II. SCENE I. An apartment in Absalom's house. Abasalom and Hadad in discourse. Ab. But you still speak as if a heavy doubt Burthened your tongue. Be plain. Think you his love Exceeds a parent's charter? Had. Troth, my lord, I scarce know how to answer. All my hopes Are so ingraft to yours, that I may see With jealous eyes. What casts a shade o'er you, Leaves me in darkness palpable; for I, With lineal honors, may a jewel lose Far dearer than Damascus' diadem. Ab. Think youâI sayâthe aim of his fond dotage Transcends the sacred limits of my rights? Had. Why, then, my lord, I must confess, this flux Of zeal, and duty, and officious homage, Observable of late, enforces me To think some ears about the Prince have caught What else I had believed an envious fable. Ab. What fable? Had. Such I held it, and, as such, My duty bade me keep it. Curse the tongue Whence slanderous rumor, like the adder-drop, Distils her venom, withering friendship's faith, Turning love's favorâ Ab. On, on. Had. My lord, a whisper steals about the city, Not widely known, or current for a truth, But credited by some,âthat, wrought upon By Joab and the Seer, the King has named The royal heir. Ab. Ha!âand I not know it? Had. Twice in the gates, and thrice upon the walls, Was I saluted yesterday, and asked If my lord Absalom had heard the rumor. 'T is said, to make the choice irrevocable, Young Solomon has received, by Nathan's hand, The private unction. Ab. Vengeance!âWhat! anoint him!â Trumpet to all mankind the damned deed That scandals his gray hairs, and robs his life Of half its lustre! Had. O, my lord, that 's past; And Time, sin's varnisher, hath done his office. Ab. Good heaven! his very angel hides his face, Even at the name of Bathshebaâ Had. But mark:â 'T is but a rumor, we may hope unfounded: Though ephod-wearers stroke their beards and smile. Ab. Founded or false, it wears a treasonous face, And looks defiance. Mitred heads, beware! And younger brothers!âDeath! ere Absalom Tamely behold the lineal ornament Plucked from his crest,âJerusalem shall quake! (Paces to and fro in agitation, then suddenly stops.) If I have forfeited my birthright, name The action!âName the hardship, name the hazard, That I have shrunk from in the public cause!â Expound meâshow meâon what plea, pretext, Precedent, yonder harlot's stripling dares Aspire before the Son of Queens, who girt His harness in the field ere he was born. Had. Let Joab answer. Ab. Were there in 't A face of justiceâBut to see my rights Slighted and trampled by a stabbing ruffian, A father's favor poisoned by the breath Of an old visionary; be left blank, Because I scorn to flatter, and protest My loyalty for favor, strips me bare Of patience; and I swear, ere brook such wrong, I'll give their chronicles a bloodier leaf Than Amnon's. Had. Pause not. Snatch the prize From brows that totter with the mighty burthen. Ab. (with surprise.) Kinsman!â I threat usurpers. Had. Frown not, nor be amazed That I outstrip you. Hadad's every hope, Life, royalty, and liberty, and love, Depend on Absalom. Who knows how soon Those precious counsellors, who hide the beams Of royal grace from you, may stigmatize Damascus as a dangerous neighbour; hint That I am turbulent, and apt for war, And may, hereafter, shake the peace of Judah; Suggest a dungeon safer than a throne, While Pharpar's lovely vale might bloom as fair Beneath his Adonijah's sceptre? Else, Why am I held assurance for the faith Which Syria never broke?ânever, my lord,â Those levies which gave umbrage were to check The insolence of Bosra. Not an hour Stand I assured of life or liberty, Till Israel's crown empale my kinsman's head.â Assents he to the alliance, which would rest The pledge of amity?âIf his intents Be fair, why hesitate?âCan policy Devise a surer bond to knit the kingdoms? Ab. No matter,âKing or no King's leave,âshe 's thine. Had. I'm grappled to your fortunes. But, my lord, Is not the bond 'twixt child and parent charged With mutual duties? If my father stint His love, neglect my nurture, cast me off, Or give my lawful portion to another, Am I his debtor still, in reverence, love, Obedience? or 's the obligation cancelled? Ab. Enough,âI'll sift, I'll sift it. Had. Might we not Extract it from the boy? Ab. Thou hast a tongue That strikes like music; thou mightst charm his heart To drop its secret. Had. But how to meet?âThe Prophet guards his steps Close as his shadow. Ab. Oft, of late, I see him Walking the Paradise and neighbouring orchards, With studious looks, among the plants and flowers, With but a slave: there you may meet him daily. Had. Perhaps Mephibosheth might lend us light: He watches all things with a dragon's eye. Ab. Assail him. Had. Promises may make him speak;â But golden ones. Ab. Nay, promise what you must. Had. And you be ignorant, my lord,âthat 's best. He carries strength; for Benjamin would cleave To any cause that served the House of Saul. Ab. Go now in search of them. Bid, as you pass, Ahithophel attend me. Had. Yes, my lord. (Exit.) Ab. Can it be?â Can he still bend on me those eyes, whose beams Of grace and glory I have coveted As Heaven, and sought by noblest acts to win. Still can he greet me with that brow of love, Radiant as Moses', yet in secret stab? Stab where he knows 't will rankle to the death?â If this be so, what need I care for aught?â I never in my proudest thought aspired To his soul's grandeur. Death it is to think How villanous counsels warp the noble mind From nature's bias!âCursed be his misleaders!â The crown is mine,âby birth, by purchase mine,â And who shall rob me of my glorious right?â (Exit.) SCENE II. The King's Paradise, without the walls. Hadad pacing up and down one of the walks. He stops as he fronts the city. Had. 'T is so;âthe hoary Harper sings aright: How beautiful is Zion!âLike a queen, Armed with a helm in virgin loveliness, Her heaving bosom in a bossy cuirass, She sits aloft, begirt with battlements And bulwarks swelling from the rock, to guard The sacred courts, pavilions, palaces, Soft gleaming through the umbrage of the woods That tuft her summit, and, like raven tresses, Wave their dark beauty round the Tower of David. Resplendent with a thousand golden bucklers, The embrazures of alabaster shine; Hailed by the pilgrims of the desert, bound To Judah's mart with Orient merchandise.â But not, for thou art fair and turret-crowned, Wet with the choicest dew of heaven, and blessed With golden fruits, and gales of frankincense, Dwell I beneath thine ample curtains. Here, Where Saints and Seers denounce,âwhere the stern Law Incessant thunders,âwhere chief Angels watch, And where the Glory hovers,âone sweet voice More fills mine ear, one neck of snow more awes me! Ha! holdâthe object of my search approachesâ Now, if the tale be truthâor forged, more like, By dark Ahithophel Ahithopel appears to have been the grandfather of Bathsheba. His enmity to David is imputed by the Jews to resentment on her account.âall 's one!âAmbition Seethes in his bosom, like the Asphaltic caves, Whose black and bitter substance, boiling up, A spark will kindle.âThis young minion's eye, Thick clustering auburn curls, and sanguine cheek, Reveal the destined worshipper of beauty. Enter Solomon, attended by two Slaves. Good morrow, little Prince. Sol. Health to you, Sir. Had. What fragrant flowers are those you carry? Sol. Buds Of Median myrtle, mandrake flowers, and camphire. Had. (scenting them.) They 're passing sweet.â What dark-eyed favorite didst thou pluck them for? Sol. For no one. Had. Ha, methinks they 'd rarely grace A lily bosom: many an one would pant, At such a token from a gallant Prince. Sol. I plucked them for my herbal. Had. Grace defend me, Ere I had reached your age, I held sweet flowers Created for no end but to adorn Young damsels, whose dark locks I loved to braid, And twine with rosy wreaths, and prank their bosoms. Intended for the throne, as you are, Prince, The loveliest virgins in my uncle's court Caressed me secretly with amorous gifts, And smiled at favors which I ravished from them. Should you not like a sweet young loving maid To toy with, and present with knots of flowers? Sol. No. Had. But why? it were a harmless pleasure. Sol. Because I would not waste my prime in dalliance. The thrifty proverb bids us plant, in youth, To blossom in our manhood, and bear fruit, When we are old. Besides, 't is said by those Most like to know, 't is not for Princes' sons To follow wantons, or to love spiced drinks. Had. Kings are meant there, or sons of Kings, at least. On whom the government will rest;âbut that, Perchance, will be your lot? Sol. Perchance. Had. Nay, more, 'T is said the King has named you to the throne? Sol. Things, oft, are said. Had. (after a pause.) But tell me truly, if a beauteous damsel, Like those young delicates about your mother, With skin like ermine, cheeks like wind-flowers, hair Like aragamen, eyes like the gazelle, Her lips a braid of scarletâ Sol. Or like my cousin Tamar. Had. Is she so tempting fair? Sol. So Hadad thinks. Had. Who told you that, my little Prince? Sol. Your eyes. Had. Speak they so plain? Sol. Not speak; they burn. For when you gaze upon her beauteous face, I see them kindle like the ruddy lamps That flame within the tabernacle. Had. Well, Do not all eyes the same, whene'er they gaze On beauteous woman, Nature's masterpiece? Sol. No, not like yours. Had. Hold, here 's a box of perfume, Sent to the King mine uncle from the East, From far Serendib. Smell it, Prince. Sol. 'T is rare.â It glides like magic through me.âNay, I prithee, Give 't me again. Had. (aside.) It works.âBehold the lid. Sol. Ye powers! what matchless youth and maid are there? Had. Venus and Tammuz. Sol. Never did my eyes Behold a sight so lovely. Had. Wouldst thou know Their story? Sol. Troth, I would. Had. Then sit we here Beneath this spreading terebinth. And first, As you 've been straitly watched, and kept so long In ignorance of things a Prince should know, I'll tell you by what chance, ere I had reached Your comely stature, I grew wiser. Sol. Do. Had. Behind my uncle's palace spreads a park, With lawns, and glades, sunned plats, and darksome woods, Through which cool Abana, clear as this fount, Winds gently past delightful arbours, shades, And green retirements from the noontide heat. There, in a solitary nook, o'erhung With trees of ancient beauty, where the stream Had scooped a little basin, fringed with flowers Even to the brim, and screened from observation By blossomed boughs, and aromatic shrubs Clustering imperviousâ Sol. Like the very bank Where these sweet lovers lie. Had. Much like it, Prince. There had I stolen, one day, from my attendants, And lay along beneath a tuft of henna, Watching the idle water. Soon, I heard The sound of voices, soft, and silver sweet, Approaching in the wood. I kept me still.â Anon, two heavenly damsels of the Queen's Entered the little arbour, and sat down Full in my view and hearing. One was white As the young lily, with luxuriant braids Of ebony; the other's blooming cheek, Like the pomegranate, blushed through locks of gold. Awhile they talked and laughed, (love all their theme,) With merry eyes, and bright carnation lips, Which deepened as they told their amorous stories. At last, the dark-haired maid proposed to lave Their limbs and glowing breasts in Abana, Unsandalled her fair foot, undid the clasps, And drew the jewelled buskin from a leg Of ivory, to try the water'sâ Enter Nathan, from a walk near them. âHa! Prince, The box! Sol. (running to Nathan.) Look, father, what a beauteous pair! And smell the perfume Hadad gave to me: 'T is sweeter than the richest aloes. (The Prophet examines the perfume; then dashes it on the ground.) Nath. (approaching Hadad sternly.) Who, what art thou, foul poisoner?âthat durst Abuse with forms and philters this young prince?â Who art thou?âIs it for the love of sin?â Or art thou leagued, for some infernal purpose, Against the House of David?âAnswer, Devil! Who art thou? Had. (pale and agitated.) One unused to terms like these, And will requite them, reverend man of God. Nath. Glare not upon me with those fiendlike eyes, Thou haggard, guilt-confounded wretch.âI curse theeâ I curse thee, and defy thee,âin Heaven's name! Come, boy. (Exit with Solomon.) Had. (gnashing his teeth.) Would Hell's eternal fire were round thee! Hell's Undying viper gnawing at thy heart!â (Pacing violently backwards and forwards, checks himself, as fearful of being observed.) Whenceâwhereforeâthis detested flesh can front Worst death, yet quails before a tottering bald-headâ Whence could he come, with such a thief-like step?â Cursed clods! too dull for aught but thunderâHa! Enter Absalom, at a distance. He comes to know our conferenceâ'T is wellâ Gloom and resentment in his mien. He seems Prepared for darker searching.âWhen he shakes Those ominous locks, I know the clime within, As the wind's temper by the lashing woods. Ab. What! hast thou seen him? Had. Yes, my lord. Ab. What said The cockatrice? Had. Wary and shrewd he seems, And shunned my questions; lessoned well, no doubt. Ere I had fully proved him, Nathan broke Imperiously upon us, and, with threats, Dragged him away. Ab. I'll know, if Hell be moved To answer. Had. Have you seen Ahithophel? Ab. He smooths it o'er, but shakes his head, and looks More than he dares confess. Had. What! will not speak? Ab. Not plainly, but believes, or doubts, at least; But I must be resolved. The howling damned Know not my suffering, for they know their doom, And steel them to endurance. Thus to live, With hate and love, revolt and reverence, Fighting like hungry vultures for my heart, I cannot, will not, long. Had. Now would to grace Some wayâsome thoughtâ Ab. Hast seen Mephibosheth? Had. My lordâ(Pauses as in reflection.) Ab. What is 't?âDeclare thy mind. Had. I almost fearâbut, were I Israel's Prince, I knew my counsel. Ab. Palter not. Had. My lord, A wondrous man is in Jerusalem, Arrived three nights ago from Babylon, Bound into Egypt to consult the Sages Touching events foretold the Assyrian King. He draws his lineage and his power from one Named in your Chronicles, who prophesied The Star from Jacob, and who trebly blessed The conquering people whom the Lords of Moab Called him to curse,âthe potent sage of Pethor, Balaam. Chief of the ancient Magi. None has since Equalled his power or piercing eye, till now; But this far-seeing Mage, 't is said, has viewed Earth's consummation, and declared what shall be When the last star expires. Ab. What, Balaam-Haddon? Had. He 's here; but keeps himself from public view. A Syrian who had known him, like myself, In Babylon, observed his caravan Enter an obscure court. I went, and saw.â The awful front, and eye oracular Were his indeed. I would consult him, Prince. Ab. (after a brief pause.) But such an act might blast me. Were it known, Idolatry! would ring from Dan to Besor. Had. Thence, I was doubtful to propose the step; Not that I held you awed by Moses' threats. âThe soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits, and after wizards,âI will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people.ââ Levit. xx. 6. But could not I obtain the intelligence Without your motion? Ab. That, indeed,â Had. I burn To know another thing, more near to you Than me, which this great Magian could resolve. Ab. What 's that? Had. What Spirit 't is that serves your father. Ab. Spirit! Had. Many suppose he holds some God, or Demon, Bond-servant to his throne, who works his will, And hath assisted all his mighty deeds. Ab. This is believed? Had. Many believe it here, And 't is the current faith of neighbouring Kings. No marvel it has missed your ear, my lord, For you pay outward reverence to the Law, And are his son. Nor is it strange, methinks, Nor passing reason. Look at his broad realm, Stretched from Euphrates to the Western Sea, From Elath to Orontes. Where is Edom? Philistia? Ammon? Where the Syrian thrones, Co?val with the world? Who smote the Chaldee? Broke Elam's bow? and taught the Desert hordes To shun his dangerous frontier? Who hath scaped Perils unnumbered; hunted, like a wolf, From den to den by King and people? Who, In fourscore stricken battles, bathed his sword In bloodiest conflict, yet sustains no scar? Who, weaponless, o'erthrew the Giant? Who Hath piled the gold and jewels till his vaults Resemble spirit-mines? Who plucks the trunks Of Lebanon, and bids them arch his roofs, Or heaps them in the vale like reeds? Who takes The spirit captive with his strings, or sweeps His kinnor till the dizzy soul ascends, As in a trance of ecstasy? My lord, Who hath done more than these? in war, in peace, The minion of the time, excelling all The Kings of earth, as yonder radiant sun The inferior orbs of heaven?âA shepherd-boy. Ab. True, Hadad, and it irks my inmost soul To break my faith with such a father. Were He less, my sin would be so. Had. If he wronged me, Though brighter than the fabled Seraphim,â Were he the God I worshipped,âI 'd fall off. Ab. Misery attends me either way. Had. My lord, Think o'er the history of his birth, whom foes Would foist above you; imp of an adulteress! Remember brave Uriah bearing back His doom, to leave the beauteous harlot free! Had this been, if the Lord protects his fortunes? Or such a guilt-avenging Being live? No,âI would learn by what presiding Genius He works his wonders;âhow subjected first;â Whether attracted by his minstrelsy;â Or by some power residing in his star;â Or how; for various are the ways to win Ascendency o'er Spirits;âand this power We know is his; for, while a beardless stripling, His skill expelled a demon from his master. Perhaps, my lord, power strong enough exists, To break the pact, and lure him to your service. Ab. Well,âsee the Mage: prove if his visioned eye Can tell us what hath chanced. I 've deeper reason Than you suspect, to prize their star-taught lore. Pray him to cast our horoscopes, both mine, And his, we fear; as for the rest, inquire Or leave it, as you will. Thou hast not yet Sounded Mephibosheth? Had. Not yet, my lord. Ab. Then do not, till we know the present issue. (Exeunt.) SCENE III. The house of Obil. Obil and Malcuth. A knocking. Obil. Woman, who knocks there? Mal. (looking through the lattice.) The crook-back Maugrabin. Obil. Ha! open, Malcuth, open. Mal. Do 't thyself. The elvish slave shall knock till doom, ere I Unsheathe a bolt. Obil. Peace, shrew. (Opens the door.) Enter Maugrabin. Mal. Spawn of the Nile, What seekest thou with us? Maug. Thy fair company.â Here, Obil, take this casket,âguard it safely,â There 's more in 't than would purchase all your tribe, Nay, every hoof that roams upon the desert. Trust it to no hand but your master's. Obil. Whose?âthe King's? Maug. Forsooth! thou feed'st his dromedaries, And he feeds thee. But is it on his gold Thou found'st the hope to see thy lovely sands Once more, and view, at ease, from thy broad tent Camels, and asses, flocks, and herds, and slaves About thee like the Patriarch? Call him Thy lord, who makes thee lord o'er others. No;â Thy master Hadad. Obil. I'll obey. Maug. (to Malcuth.) Farewell, sweet leopardess. (Signs to Obil, who lays the casket on the table, and follows him out.) Mal. They 're whispering;â Now, by our mother Hagar, but I'll see What wondrous treasureâLying knave! (Opening the casket.) 'T is nothing but a monstrous key,âenchased As for some royal sepulchreâHa! how?â It will not closeâand Maugrabin's returning. (Throws it down, and exit.) SCENE IV. The terraced roof of Absalom's house, by night; adorned with vases of flowers, and fragrant shrubs: an awning spread over part of it. Tamar and Hadad. Tam. No, no, I well rememberâproofs, you said, Unknown to Moses. Had. Well, my love, thou know'st I 've been a traveller in various climes; Trod Ethiopia's scorching sands, and scaled The snow-clad mountains; trusted to the deep; Traversed the fragrant islands of the sea, And with the Wise conversed of many nations. Tam. I know thou hast. Had. Of all mine eyes have seen, The greatest, wisest, and most wonderful, Is that dread sage, the Ancient of the Mountain. Tam. Who? Had. None knows his lineage, age, or name: his locks Are like the snows of Caucasus; his eyes Beam with the wisdom of collected ages. In green, unbroken years, he sees, 't is said, The generations pass, like autumn fruits, Garnered, consumed, and springing fresh to life, Again to perish, while he views the sun, The seasons roll, in rapt serenity, And high communion with celestial powers. Some say 't is Shem, our father, some say Enoch, And some Melchisideck. Tam. I 've heard a tale Like this, but ne'er believed it. Had. I have proved it.â Through perils dire, dangers most imminent, Seven days and nights 'midst rocks and wildernesses, And boreal snows, and never-thawing ice, Where not a bird, a beast, a living thing, Save the far-soaring vulture comes, I dared My desperate way, resolved to know, or perish. Tam. Rash, rash adventurer! Had. On the highest peak Of stormy Caucasus, there blooms a spot On which perpetual sunbeams play, where flowers And verdure never die; and there he dwells. Tam. But didst thou see him? Had. Never did I view Such awful majesty: his reverend locks Hung like a silver mantle to his feet, His raiment glistered saintly white, his brow Rose like the gate of Paradise, his mouth Was musical as its bright guardians' songs. Tam. What did he tell thee? O! what wisdom fell From lips so hallowed? Had. Whether he possess The Tetragrammaton,âthe powerful Name Inscribed on Moses' rod, by which he wrought Unheard of wonders, which constrains the Heavens To part with blessings, shakes the earth, and rules The strongest Spirits; or if God hath given A delegated power, I cannot tell. But 't was from him I learned their fate, their fall, Who, erewhile, wore resplendent crowns in Heaven; Now, scattered through the earth, the air, the sea. Them he compels to answer, and from them Has drawn what Moses, nor no mortal ear, Has ever heard. Tam. But did he tell it thee? Had. He told me much,âmore than I dare reveal; For with a dreadful oath he sealed my lips. Tam. But canst thou tell me nothing?âWhy unfold So much, if I must hear no more? Had. You bade Explain my words, almost reproached me, sweet, For what by accident escaped me. Tam. Ah! A littleâsomething tell me,âsure, not all Were words inhibited. Had. Then, promise never, Never to utter of this conference A breath to mortal. Tam. Solemnly I vow. Had. Even then, 't is little I can say, compared With all the marvels he related. Tam. Come, I'm breathless.âTell me how they sinned, how fell. Had. Their Prince involved them in his ruin. Tam. What black offence on his devoted head Drew such dire punishment? Had. The wish to be As the All-Perfect. Tam. Arrogating that Peculiar to his Maker!âawful crime! But what their doom? their place of punishment? Had. Above, about, beneath; earth, sea, and air; Their habitations various as their minds, Employments, and desires. âThe fall of Angels, therefore, was pride. Since their fall, their practices have been the clean contrary unto those before mentioned; for being dispersed, some in the air, some in the earth, some amongst the minerals, dens, and caves that are under the earth, they have by all means labored to effect an universal rebellion against the laws, and as far as in them lieth, utter destruction of the works of God.ââ Hooker, Eccles. Polity, b. 1, sec. 4. Tam. But are they round us, Hadad?ânot confined In penal chains and darkness? Had. So he said; And so your holy books infer. What saith Your Prophet? what the Prince of Uz? Tam. I shudder, Lest some dark Minister be near us now. Had. You wrong them. They are bright Intelligences, Robbed of some native splendor, and cast down, 'T is true, from heaven; but not deformed, and foul, Revengeful, malice-working Fiends, as fools Suppose. They dwell, like Princes, in the clouds; Sun their bright pinions in the middle sky; Or arch their palaces beneath the hills, With stones inestimable studded so, That sun or stars were useless there. Tam. Good heavens! Had. He bade me look on rugged Caucasus, Crag piled on crag beyond the utmost ken, Naked, and wild, as if creation's ruins Were heaped in one immeasurable chain Of barren mountains, beaten by the storms Of everlasting winter. But within Are glorious palaces, and domes of light, Irradiate halls, and crystal colonnades, Blazing with lustre past the noontide beam, Or, with a milder beauty, mimicking The mystic signs of changeful Mazzaroth. Tam. Unheard of wonders! Had. There they dwell, and muse, And wander; Beings beautiful, immortal, Minds vast as heaven, capacious as the sky; Whose thoughts connect past, present, and to come, And glow with light intense, imperishable. So in the sparry chambers of the Sea And Air-Pavilions, upper Tabernacles, They study Nature's secrets, and enjoy No poor dominion. Tam. Are they beautiful, And powerful far beyond the human race? Had. Man's feeble heart cannot conceive it. When The Sage described them, fiery eloquence Broke from his lips, his bosom heaved, his eyes Grew bright and mystical; moved by the theme, Like one who feels a deity within. Tam. Wondrous!âWhat intercourse have they with men? Had. Sometimes they deign to intermix with man, But oft with woman. Tam. Ha! with woman? Had. She Attracts them with her gentler virtues, soft, And beautiful, and heavenly, like themselves. They have been known to love her with a passion Stronger than human. Tam. That surpasses all You yet have told me. Had. This the Sage affirms; And Moses, darkly. Tam. How do they appear?âHow love?â Had. Sometimes 't is spiritual, signified By beatific dreams, or more distinct And glorious apparition.âThey have stooped To animate a human form, and love Like mortals. Tam. Frightful to be so beloved!â Frightful! who could endure the horrid thought? Had. (after a pause.) But why contemn a Spirit's love? so high, So glorious, if he haply deigned?â Tam. Forswear My Maker! love a Demon! Had. NoâO, no,â My thoughts but wanderedâOft, alas! they wander. Tam. Why dost thou speak so sadly now?âAnd lo! Thine eyes are fixed again upon Arcturus. Thus ever, when thy drooping spirits ebb, Thou gazest on that star. Hath it the power To cause or cure thy melancholy mood?â (He appears lost in thought.) Tell me,âascrib'st thou influence to the stars? Had. (starting.) The stars!âWhat know'st thou of the stars? Tam. I know that they were made to rule the night. Had. Like palace lamps! Thou echoest well thy grandsire!â Woman! The stars are living, glorious, Amazing, infinite!â Tam. Speak not so wildly.â I know them numberless, resplendent, set As symbols of the countless, countless years That make eternity. Had. Thou speak'st the wordâ O, had ye provedâlike those Great Sufferers,â Shot, once for all, the gulf,âfelt myriad ages Only the prelude,âcould ye scan the void With eyes as searching as its torments,â Thenâthenâmightst thou pronounce it feelingly! Tam. What ails thee, Hadad?âDraw me not so close Had. Tamar! I need thy loveâmore than thy loveâ Tam. Thy cheek is wet with tearsâNay, let us partâ 'T is lateâI cannot, must not linger.â (Breaks from him, and exit.) Had. Loved and abhorred!âStill, still accursed!â (He paces, twice or thrice, up and down, with passionate gestures; then turns his face to the sky, and stands a moment in silence.) âO! where, In the illimitable space, in what Profound of untried misery, when all His worlds, his rolling orbs of light, that fill With life and beauty yonder infinite, Their radiant journey run, for ever set, Where, where, in what abyss shall I be groaning? (Exit.) ACT III. SCENE I. The inner apartment of David's sepulchre, filled with treasure: a sarcophagus of Egyptian porphyry standing in the centre. Enter Absalom, Hadad, and Balaam-Haddon, as from another chamber of the tomb. Balaam-Haddon carries a lamp, and a silver vessel for the burning of perfume. B. Hadd. Behold, my lord, the last and richest! Here, Nothing but gold of Ophir, pearls, and gems Of priceless value. How they catch the lamp beams, And sparkle as I wave it, like the stars Upon a fitful night of clouds. And lo! The marble in whose womb he means to sleep. Ab. It strikes me dumbâwhat heaps, what mountain piles! The pillage of the world were scarce enough To sum the riches we have gazed upon. Had. But whence can he have drawn them? there 's the question. He has pulled down, indeed, some barbarous thrones, Made Syria tributary, and brought home Rich spoil; but in the chambers of this rock Josephus, speaking of the burial of David, observes:âHe had great and immense wealth buried with him, the vastness of which may be easily conjectured at by what I shall now say; for, a thousand and three hundred years afterwards, Hyrcanus the High Priest, when he was besieged by Antiochus that was called the Pious, the son of Demetrius, and was desirous of giving him money to get him to raise the siege, and draw off his army; and having no other method of compassing the money, opened one room of David's sepulchre, and took out three thousand talents, and gave part of that sum to Antiochus, and by this means caused the siege to be raised, as we have informed the reader elsewhere. Nay, after him, and that many years, Herod the King opened another room, and took away a great deal of money; and yet neither of them came at the coffins of the Kings themselves.ââ Antiq. of the Jews, b. 7, ch. 15. The riches left by David, according to the common computation, exceeded eight hundred millions sterling. Are treasures which the empires of the earth, United, cannot equal. Whence they come I'm bent to know. His flocks, and herds, and tilth, Vineyards, and olive-grounds, and all he draws Of yearly revenue from all the tribes, From Elath, and the Eastern caravans, Shrink to an alms. Ab. I know not what to think. The Mage must answer. Had. Balaam-Haddon, speak. B. Hadd. If there be power in incantations, spells, Or potency in stars, or strongest magic, Or compounds such as these, some one shall answer. (Places the vessel on the further part of the sarcophagus, heaps drugs upon it, and kindles them by the lamp.) Stand by me here, my lords:âobserve, but speak not. (A thick smoke rises, which envelopes the remoter part of the tomb: Absalom and Hadad stand with their eyes intently fixed upon it: Balaam-Haddon mutters an incantation, casting, from time to time, perfumes upon the flame. A form becomes dimly visible amidst the smoke; its eyes and countenance sparkling. Absalom continues silently gazing. Balaam-Haddon turns to him.) Address your questions briefly; when the smoke Decays, it vanishes. Ab. Whatâwhoâart thou? Spirit. The Genius of the Throne. Ab. Servest thou the King? Spirit. I serve the Throne, and him who sits thereon. Ab. Implying thou mightst serve his son? Spirit. If he Were chief in Jewry. Ab. Canst thou make him so? Spirit. No, nor oppose: I have no present power Upon the blood of David. Had. Prince, mark that! Ab. Canst thou foresee?âKnow'st thou the past? Spirit. Dim shadows of the future lie before me, Like forms in twilight: all things past I know. Ab. Then answer, I adjure thee; for to this Wert thou evoked.âIs Solomon elect To David's throne?âHas he received the unction? Spirit. The kingly oil hath flowed upon his locks. Had. Change not, my lord.âWhat boots a horn of oil Against that sword, that military arm, Thy power in Israel? Ab. And now I care notâHeaven or Hell to aid, I'll prove the issue.âSpirit, art thou bound By ties indissoluble to the King? Spirit. I serve the Throne, till thrice three times revolve. Ab. Three timesâ B. Hadd. So Spirits reckon; he will not reveal.â Who bound thee? Spirit. Jesse's son. B. Hadd. Serv'st thou in love? Spirit. No; for he hath not kept his covenant. Ab. But shall the son of Bathsheba be King? Spirit. He may be, or may not. Ab. How know'st thou that? Spirit. I read it in thy horoscope. Ab. Know'st thou My destiny? Spirit. I know what may be. Ab. Speak,â Reveal,âI do beseech thee, mighty Power, How I may hold my lawful birthright. B. Hadd. Speak. Spirit. What said the Chaldee, whom thou saw'st at Geshur? Ab. Ha! Spirit. What answer brought he from the palace tower Of Talmai, on the night of Pentecost? Ab. The holy Gods! Spirit. A hostile Planet, near allied to thee, Threatens eclipse and blood; o'ercome but that, And length of days, and glory shall be thine. That powerful Star is Solomon's, and rides Hard by the ascendant. Ab. But hath not yet attained it? Spirit. It enters on the seventh of Tisri. Ab. Gods! Had. So near? Ab. Direct me. How can I o'ercome? Spirit. Possess the crown ere Tisri. Ab. Shall I, then, Be fortunate? Spirit. Beyond thy father, or the happiest mortal. Ab. And thou wilt serve me? Spirit. As I now do him. B. Hadd. Reveal the nature of thy services. Spirit. I give him strength, enlarge his heart, protect His life, extend his realm, diffuse his glory, And rifle, at his bidding, earth, and sea. B. Hadd. Thou brought'st these treasures then? Spirit. My servants did. Ab. Stayâtell meâshall I see theeâ Spirit. When thou sitt'st Upon thy father's throne. (The smoke disperses, the image fades and disappears.) Ab. By Astaroth! My faith extended not to this:âthe words, The self-same syllables, ne'er breathed to mortal,â In which a potent Chaldee summed my fate. Had. Nothing escapes them. Ab. Hence, Hadad, hence my fears, My cares, my policy, my flattering arts To win the people, and strike root so deep That none could pluck me.âEver in my ears Rung the presaging voice;âand years of toil Yield but this hairbreadth. How, in half a moon, Could I have built my name to that great height, Needful to front my father's power? how sought The dangerous elements? how organized them?â Now, like Manoah's son, my hidden strength Can shake the kingdom when my trumpet sounds. Had. (to Balaam-Haddon.) What seest thou?âwhat transports thee?â (To Absalom.) Mark!âmark him! B. Hadd. Far offâfar offâ Enthroned upon a pedestal so high That East and West behold itânations kneel To kiss its baseâthe symbol in its hand Marks universal power;âits radiant head Bears to the sky a diadem so bright That suns look pale;âits arm gigantic crests Heaven, like the zodiac, and o'erawes the world!â Mountains unhoard their treasures, ocean breaks Obedient at its footstool; every tongue And people shout, âHosanna to the Son Of David!â Had. (starting.) Ha! Ab. He faints. Had. The wonted tranceâ Thus lay the son of Beor on Mount Pisgah, By Balak's altars.âPowers Demonian, mark, Record! (Aside and agitated.) Ab. But heard you how he spake? Had. He spake The Spirit's bidding, Prince. Observed you not The supernatural brightness of his eye, The majesty that swelled his form, his voice How godlike? Into him the Shadow passed, Foretold, and left him. Ab. Darest thou hope for me An empire so magnificent? Had. My lord, my lord, thou deem'st this little realm Much, and aspir'st, as to the top of glory, To rule these Tribes, and curb the neighbour Kings; But seest not, for thou hast not roamed the world, Kingdoms on kingdoms opening to thy view, In prospect dazzling as the vales of Heaven; Thrones ancient as the Flood, where mighty Kings Rule, toward the rising sun, o'er plains where gold, And ivory, and aloes, and almug, Abound like olives on the hills of Judah, Or palms by Jericho, where spicy Isles Perfume the seas, and coral rocks and pearl Glitter along the shore. There thou mayst win Thy conquering way, there plant thy throne, and wield The universal sceptre. Ab. Is thy tongue Endued with witchcraft? Had. None thou need'st, to stand The World's acknowledged master. Hadst thou not The Spirit's promise, in these caves behold A talisman, and in thy father's veterans Unshrinking agents to thy boldest wish. He from the sheep-cote to the sceptre rose; Thou, with that sceptre, grasped in manhood's prime, Mayst subjugate mankind. But such designs Require immediate action, cannot linger An old man's ebbing sands: that were to lose Irreparable time, which, seized, extends Thy empire past the pillars of Sesostris. Ab. Come, these are fond conceits that make one giddy. The place, or hour, or that unearthly form, Whose thrilling accents vibrate in my ears, Or thy wild visions, or these heaps of gold, Disorder me. My brain seems all on fire, Yet a sepulchral coldness numbs my heart. Let 's leave this treasure-house of death. I'll pause, This night, upon it. If to-morrow dawn Upon my unchanged purpose, thou must speed To Geshur, and, perhaps, Damascus. Had. Look, The Mage recovers; let us lead him hence. âHe,â (Manasseh, King of Judah,) âobserved times, and used witchcraft, and dealt with a Familiar Spirit.ââ 2 Chron. xxxiii. 6. (Exeunt.) SCENE II. An apartment in Obil's house: Obil and Malcuth. Mal. What shakes thee so, and makes thee look so pale? Obil. That dromedary Fiend,âthat beast of Hell,â Lean, black, and demon-like, it stands; it eats not, Drinks not to satisfy an ass's foal; But ruminates the livelong day, and glares Upon me when I enter, with an eye Of such unnatural meaning, that I quake Lest human words should follow. In the gloom, Its eyeballs burn like living fires. Just now, As in the torchlight trembling I approached it, I thoughtâI swear, I thought she folded quickly A griffin wing. Mal. What senseless prate is this? Obil. And when I wait, by night, without the walls, Long ere his step is audible, she snorts, Springs, rears, and trembles, turns her flaring nostril Up toward the midnight clouds, and paws, and spurns, And vanishes, when Hadad mounts, as yet Earth-born Aashari The fleetest kind of dromedary. never did. Mal. And this Has blanched thy manhood so? Obil. I 've marked, besides, When from his night-career, at dawn, he comes, Though flaked with foam, and panting like a steed That has outstripped the ostrich, not a hair Is stained, no speck of clay deforms her limbs. Hassid, our son, is bold, and he declares, As on a gusty night he stood by Kedron Awaiting in my stead, a spectral voice Accosted Hadad ere beyond his hearing, And in the hollow wind their accents mingled. Mal. His fear, you mean, mistook the wind for voices. Obil. After this present business, whose blind haste Betides to beasts and riders length of rest, I'll to my tents: I 've gold enough: I'll tend No demon coursers, though a Prince bestride them. Mal. Thou 'dst! hold the rein barehead' to Beelzebub, So he would stuff thy turban folds with shekels. Obil. Peace, cassowar! Has Maugrabin been here? Mal. No, no. But tell me, Obil, Know you the purpose of these meetings? Obil. Hush! hark!âThey bode more good to Ishmael Than cockered IsaacâHark! (A knocking.) Begone I say. (Exit Malcuth.) (Obil passes through an outer room to the door, and returns assisting in Mephibosheth.) Mephib. Look to my mule, good fellow, wilt thou, quick? Take her from sight.âAnd dally not. (Exit Obil.) Now let me breathe;âno eye beholds me here,â But in the streets, methought, each one I met Gazed on me, whispering with suspicious looks, âWhere goes Mephibosheth at this dusk hour?â That David strongly suspected Mephibosheth of some participation in the rebellion, is apparent from his behaviour to Ziba. When Mephibosheth meets the King, on his return to Jerusalem, with external signs of the deepest sorrow for his misfortunes, and protests that the accusations of his servant are false and slanderous; David, instead of indignantly annulling his gift to Ziba of Mephibosheth's possessions, and inflicting the punishment he would have merited, had his master's story been believed, answers: âWhy speakest thou any more of thy matters? I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land.ââ See also Josephus: Translator's note, b. 8, ch. 11. Voices and feet seemed following me.â'T is strange.â How oft have I preferred the evening shade To visit Ramah, or go down to Bethel, Pleased with the starry dimness! Now, the night Seems but the pall of guilt. Conspiracy! If thou canst look so grim to me,âdethroned, Dishonored, stripped of all my noblest rights,â How colorest thou thy devilish front to him, The chief conspirer?âWhat, (Re-enter Obil.) are they not come? Obil. O, yes, my lord, since the first watch. Mephib. What! what! Obil. This way, my lord. (Exeunt.) SCENE III. Another apartment. Absalom, Hadad, Ahithophel, Manasses, and Malchiah, seated round a table, with lights and parchments, in consultation. Enter Obil, with Mephibosheth. Ab. Good even, Prince. Ahith. Prosperity to Benjamin. Mephib. Health to my lord,âto grave Ahithophel,â To all. (Seats himself at the table.) Had. Time urges. Shall we call in Caleb? Ab. Ay, instantly. (Obil goes out, on a sign from Hadad. Absalom turns to Mephibosheth.) Prince, all the northern Tribes, To Benjamin are sure. Here are the seals Of Gad and Reuben: Naphtali is sworn, And Pagiel, their prince, has twice passed down, Communing with our partisans as far As Shiloh. Twenty thousand valiant men Wait but our summons. Such, in brief, these letters, All verbally confirmed by faithful couriers, Whose words and pledges we have ta'en to-night. Mephib. Business has thriven, my lord, in my poor absence. Re-enter Obil with a Courier. Ab. What tidings. Caleb, from the hill country? Courier. Every face, my Prince, Is lifted to salute the sun. Ahith. All tiptoe on the mountains, say'st thou?âWell, A speedy and a glorious dawn awaits them, A rising such as Judah never saw. Ab. What cities hast thou greeted? Courier. All the chief From Ajalon to Kadesh.âThis, from Giloh, My lord Ahithophel; this from the chiefs Of Ziph and Lachish. (Takes letters from the folds of his cap for Absalom and Ahithophel. Ahith. (after perusing his despatches.) All 's well; and bids us not delay. Ab. This missive Seals our resolves. It comes from Ithamar.â Our royal trumpet will be blown in Hebron At the sixth hour to-morrow? Mephib. (starting.) How! to-morrow? Malchi. To-morrow, Prince? Ab. Ten thousand men encamp Before it ere that hour. By eventide, The news must be beyond the Kishon. Mephib. (aside.) Moses! Ahith. Be not surprised, my lords: our safety lies In suddenness. The cloud is in the heaven, The bolt must fly, or men will shun it. Manass. Yes, butâ Had. Pardon, my lord Manasses,âI am rude,â And sage Ahithophel, our reverend Thummim, Grant me a word. We twice have been convened, Without our friends Malchiah and Manasses. Briefly to them I state what you have heard.â I have myself passed through the Tribes; with all The Princes, Judges, powerful of our friends, Held personal conference; to the nicest point Instructed them; ta'en pledges; armed their mouths With potent arguments; explaining thus The strong necessity of all we do. The King, whom Heaven preserve! declined in years, Lets fall the reins; oppressors lord it; wrongs Cry in the streets with none to hear; the Judge Sits not between the gates; the King nor hears, Nor substitutes: imperious Joab rules God's heritage, and shakes his bloody hand Over the innocent: old Nathan sits Close at his master's ear, whispering against The People's Chosen, bent to crown the boy, Whom secretly, 't is said, he hath affianced To Pharaoh's infant daughter. When the fit Of penitential horror shakes the King, He talks of Amnon,âfratricide,âand blood Demanding expiation, and alarms His mind infirm with guilt and punishment. Thus stands the kingdom; thus your cherished hopes Totter to downfall. And will warlike Israel Behold her lawful, her elected Prince Undone by treacherous instruments? submit Her stainless sceptre to a murderer's hand? For what awes ruthless Joab from the crown But Absalom? Think you, a Prince's blood, A helpless youth, were sacred in his sight If David slept, and Absalom were not, Who, only, never feared him? Men of Israel, Would you perpetuate your royal line, Age must resign the rod of power to manhood.â With these, my lords, and other arguments Suggested by the wise Ahithophel, Are they replenished, and prepared for action. Manass. Then let us on. Had. My uncle promises Full fifteen thousand footmen, and is pledged A thousand chariots, and five thousand horse By Hadadezer, if the sword decide it: Our grandsire Talmai The King of Geshur,âthe maternal grandfather of Absalom, and supposed to bear the same relationship to Hadad. empties all his realm. Malchi. I'm satisfied, my lord. Mephib. Sirs, may the son of Saul A moment's audience crave? Ab. Speak, worthy Prince. Mephib. My lord, I have allied to this great cause The strongest Tribe save Judah. I demand Recognisance, before these witnesses, Of promises not mentioned, as were meet, Before this solemn sitting.âYes, my lords, I claim his oath, that, if by me, the strength Of Benjamin were added, he would bound His power by Jordan eastward, and resign The ancient sovereignty of Ishbosheth To me, the lineal heir. (A pause.) Manass. Can this be so? Malchi. Divide the sceptre! Ahith. (smiting the table.) Never! Mephib. But he hath sworn it. Ab. If the Tribes consented. Mephib. The pledge was absolute,â There stands your organ. Let him answer. Ab. Hadad? Had. My lord Mephibosheth,âif I err not,â That promise was conditioned onâ Mephib. Nothing!â By God's Ark! 't was a solemn gage,âunclogged,â And bound his princely honor to enforce it. (Hadad draws Absalom apart.) Manass. We have no right to mutilate the sceptre; The royalty is Judah's. Ahith. Fixed in him: A right perpetual promised. Mephib. Ye mock,âye mock! A right forsooth!âBy what right sit ye here In treasonous council? Plead ye right for thisâ Had. The sooner, Prince, the better. Ab. (to Mephib.) The question of divided sovereignty Requiring grave debate, and general sanction, Must wait the assembling of the Tribes, my lord.â Let us dissolve now: all is understood.â My father's leave is won, to sacrifice In solemn state at Hebron, to fulfill My vow in Geshur. Meet me there to-morrow. The flower of Judah will attend in arms. Stir with the dawn; nor marvel if ye spy Friends of the King upon the way: I 've bid Two hundred follow us, the more to cloak The enterprise. And now, my lords, farewell. Manass. Farewell. Malchi. Farewell and prosper, noble Prince. Ab. Take separate streets, you who ascend to Zion. I keep the west, by Millo. Manass. We'll be guarded. (Exeunt all but Hadad, Mephibosheth, and Obil.) Mephib. Fit recompense For trusting traitors!âFellow, bring my mule. Had. Stay.â You go not forth to-night. Mephib. How now! Thou shuffling, perjuredâ Had. Curb your passion, Prince. Mephib. Now, by the bones of SaulâBring forth my mule. Had. (to Obil.) Stir, and thou diest. Mephib. Ruffian, meanest to slay me? Had. Hear me, my lord. The Prince's words, 't is true, I strained beyond theirâ Mephib. Leprous Gentile! Lie to your brutish gods, lie not to me! Had. No matter: you and I best know the wherefore:â But danger 's in thine eye, and I'll not risk The safety of the state. You must repose Beneath good Obil's roof to-night. Mephib. Abhorred, Damned, heathen parasiteâ Had. Tush! have a care! (Half draws his dagger, with a threatening glance: then turns to Obil.) Provide thy best for Prince Mephibosheth; Respect him as myself; but if he look Beyond thy doors ere the third morning hour, Your blood be on ye both!âWhat! hear'st thou? Obil. Master, reverently. Had. Remember!âeyes will be about these doors Which ye were best avoid.âGood rest, my lord. (Returns his dagger to the sheath, and exit. Scene closes.) SCENE IV. An apartment in Absalom's house. Nathan and Tamar. Nath. But tell me, hast thou ever noted Amidst his many shining qualities Aught strange or singular?âunlike to others? That caused thy wonder? even to thyself Moved thee to say, âHow?âWherefore 's this?â Tam. Never. Nath. Nothing that marked him from the rest of men?â Hereafter you shall know why thus I question. Tam. O yes, unlike he seems in many things: In knowledge, eloquence, high thoughts. Nath. Proud thoughts Thou mean'st? Tam. I'm but a young and simple maid, But, father, he, of all my ears have judged, Is master of the loftiest, richest mind. Nath. How have I wronged him; deeming him more apt For intricate designs, and daring deeds, Than contemplation's solitary flights. Tam. Seer, his far-soaring thoughts ascend the stars, Pierce the unseen abyss, pervade, like light, The universe, and wing the infinite. Nath. (fixing his eyes upon her.) What stores of love, and praise, and gratitude, He thence must bring to Him whose mighty hand Fashioned their glories, hung yon golden orbs Amidst his wondrous firmament; who bids The day-spring know his place, and sheds from all Sweet influences; who bars the haughty sea, Binds fast his dreadful hail, but drops the dew Nightly upon his People! How his soul, Returning from its quest through Earth and Heaven, Must glow with holy fervor!âDoth it, maiden? Tam. Ah! father, father, were it so indeed, I were too happy. Nath. How!âexpound thy words. Tam. Though he has trod the confines of the world, Knows all its wonders, and almost has pierced The secrets of eternity, his heart Is melancholy, lone, discordant, save When love attunes it into happiness. He hath not found, alas, the peace which dwells But with our Fathers' God. Nath. And canst thou love One who loves not Jehovah? Tam. O, ask not. Nath. (fervently.) My child! thou wouldst not wed an Infidel? Tam. (in tears.) O no! O no! Nath. Why then this embassage? Why doth your sire Still urge the King? Why hast thou hearkened it? Tam. There was a time when I had hopes,âwhen truth Seemed dawning in his mind,âand sometimes, still, Such heavenly glimpses shine, that my fond heart Refuses to forego the hope, at last, To number him with Israel. Nath. Beware! Or thou 'lt delude thy soul to ruin. Say, Doth he attend our holy ordinances? Tam. He promises observance. Nath. Two full years Hath he abode in Jewry. Tam. Prophet, think How he was nurturedâin the faith of Idols.â That impious worship long since he abjured By his own native strength; and now he looks Abroad through Nature's works, and yet must riseâ Nath. Speaks he of Moses? Tam. Familiar as thyself. Nath. I think thou saidst he had surveyed the world? Tam. O, father, he can speak Of hundred-gated Thebes, towered Babylon, And mightier Nineveh, vast Palibothra, Serendib anchored by the gates of morning, Renowned Benares, where the Sages teach The mystery of the soul, and that famed Ilium Where fleets and warriors from Elishah's Isles Besieged the Beauty, where great Memnon fell:â Of pyramids, temples, and superstitious caves Filled with strange symbols of the Deity; Of wondrous mountains, desert-circled seas, Isles of the ocean, lovely Paradises, Set, like unfading emeralds, in the deep. Nath. Yet manhood scarce confirms his cheek. Tam. All this His thirst of knowledge has achieved; the wish To gather from the wise eternal Truth. Nath. Not found where he has sought it, and has led Thy wandering fancy. Tam. O, might I relateâ But I bethink me, father, of a thing Like that you asked.âSometimes, when I'm alone,â Just ere his coming,âI have heard a sound, A strange, mysterious, melancholy sound,â Like music in the air. Anon, he enters. Nath. Ha! is this oft? Tam. 'T is not unfrequent. Nath. Only When thou 'rt alone? Tam. I have not heard it else. Nath. A sound like what? Tam. Like wild, sad music, father; More moving than the lute or viol touched By skilful fingers. Wailing in the air It seems around me, and withdraws as when One looks and lingers for a last adieu. Nath. Just ere he enters? Tam. At his step it dies. Nath. Mark me.âThou know'st 't is held by righteous men, That Heaven intrusts us all to Holy Watchers, âTake heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, that in heaven their Angels do always behold the face of my Father, which is in heaven.ââ Matt. xviii. 10. âAre they not all ministering Spirits, sent forth to minister for them who should be heirs of salvation?ââ Hebrews, i. 14. âThe Angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.ââ Psalm xxxiv. 7. The Jews universally believed in Guardian Angels. Who ward us from the Tempter.âThis I deem Some intimation of an unseen danger. Tam. But whence? Nath. Time may reveal: meanwhile, I warn thee, Trust not thyself alone with Hadad. Tam. Think'st thouâ Nath. I scarce know what I think,âmy thoughts are troubled. If some lewd Spirit, taken with thy beauty, Or plotting to deceive and disunite us, Could put on human semblance, this were he. Tam. O! father, fatherâ Nath. Inscrutable he seems, yet ever busy; His mocking eye insults, while it emits The malice of the serpent: snake-like, too, He slinks away, even while his looks dart fury. Nay, nayâI lay not to his chargeâI know Little of him, though I have supplicatedâ I will not wound thee with my dark suspicionsâ But shun the peril thou art warned of, shun What looks like danger though we haply err. Be not alone with him I charge thee. Tam. Seer, I will avoid it. Nath. All is ominous: The Oracles are mute, dreams warn no more, Urim and Thummim keep their glory hid, My days are dark, my nights are visionless, Jehovah hath forsaken, or in wrath, Resigned us for a season. Times like these Are jubilee in Hell. Fiends walk the Earth, âAnd the Lord said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the Lord and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.ââ Job, i. 7. Misleading princes, tempting poor men's pillows, Supplying moody hatred with the dagger, Lust with occasions, treason with excuses, Lifting man's heart, like the rebellious waves, Against his Maker. Watch, and pray, and tremble; So may the Highest overshadow thee! (Nathan retires, followed slowly out by Tamar.) SCENE V. The gate of the city, looking down the valley toward Enrogel. Several Citizens sitting in the gate. The Warden walking with his truncheon in his hand. First Cit. Know you what enterprise our Prince intends After the sacrifice? Second Cit. No; doth he any? First Cit. Eliab's son, last night, 'twixt this and Hebron Met his war chariot and his battle steeds. Warden. The Prince went forth at dawn this morning, Sir, Upon a mule. His chariot has not passed. First Cit. But Amariah saw it. Warden. When? last night? First Cit. Journeying this way, about the second watch, He heard the clang of hoofs, and, drawing close Beneath some sycamores, beheld it pass, Horses, equerries, and a baggage wain, That clashed, the place being rough, as filled with arms. Third Cit. But this is strange. Third Cit. But this is strange. Warden. It did not pass this gate. Third Cit. Why go about? First Cit. Perhaps he meditates A swoop upon the restless Edomite. Second Cit. Look! who comes there at speed? First Cit. See how for life he dashes through the brook, And up the hill.âHa! look!âthe animal Is spent, and fallsâ Second Cit. He stops notâlo! he comes Like the sped arrow. 'T is some messenger. Warden. Fall back, and let him pass. (Warden calls aloud.) What for King David? (A messenger rushes through the gate.) Mess. War tidingsâBar the gates!â (Passes up into the city.) Citizens. What can it mean?âLet 's after. (Exeunt into the city.) Warden. His looks were ominous. I'll to the tower, And see if any hostile shape approaches. (Exit.) SCENE VI. Tamar walking on the roof of her father's house. Tam. Once, in his gentle countenance, methought, Love grew on reverence, as my lips described The power, the patience, purity, and faith Of our Almighty Father!âThen I hoped His spirit, tempered by its earthly passion, Fast ripening for a love that never dies!â Most strange!âIncomprehensible the more, The more I think!âAll tenderness, all love, He seemed,âhappy and social as a child:â But now into such deeps of thought he lapses, So like despair,âas makes me weep, or, rather, Tremble, when snatched by some ungoverned transportâ What sounds are those?âA tumult?â'T is the cry And rush of multitudes!âWhat noise is that? (To Bagoas, who enters hastily.) Bag. 'T is nothing, Princess.âCome within. Tam. Hark!âHark!â The clamor rises! Bag. Nay, most honored Princessâ (Attempts to lead her away.) Tam. Unhand me, slave! Bag. Beseech yeâstern was his command Thou shouldst not stir abroad, or look without, Until my lord's return. My life must answer 't. Tam. (looking from the parapet.) Good heavens!âWhat dire disaster?âWhence that throng Of frantic womenâchildrenâancient men Tearing their beards and garmentsâHa! the Ark! Abiathar and Zadok weeping by itâ The Priests and LevitesâGracious God! some foe Hath sure surprised us!âHear me!âPeople!âFriends!â Bag. Hark, lady!âPrincess,â (Kneels.) Tam. Horror! there's the Kingâ Barefootâamidst his weeping householdâ Bag. No, noâ Tam. His gray head bareâhis mantle rent!âO, hear me! (Stretching her hands to the people below.) Look up!âO, answer me!âMy father David!â Bag. (drawing her away.) Cry not, but listenâ Tam. (breaking from him, rushes again to the parapet.) Ho! hear me!âLevites!âFriends!âWill no one answer? Bag. I'll answer, lady: call not to the people. Tam. (wildly.) What has befallen him?âwherefore's the tumult? Bag. Your grandsire is no longer King. Tam. Alas! Is Zion taken? Bag. Not by foes.âThe Prince, Your father, wears, to-day, the Hebrew crown. Tam. (thunderstruck.) My father! Bag. Surely, Princess;âlook not pale. Tam. (gasping for breath.) My fatherâmyâ Bag. By all the gods, 't is true,âmay wrath o'ertake me If I deceive you,âcrowned this day at Hebron. What say'st?âthy white lips moveâ (Tamar falls senseless.) ACT IV. SCENE I. The top of Mount Olivet, crowded with fugitives from Jerusalem: King David, surrounded by his household, worshipping: the Cherethites and Pelethites The Cherethites and Pelethites, or the Extirpators and the Expeditious, were the King's military attendants, and the immediate agents of his will. restrain the People from pressing upon him. Joab, Benaiah, and other armed Chiefs, marshalling the multitude. Ben. Go bid yon loiterers hasten over Kedron, If they would march with us. Joab. Let them abide:â Why crawl they after us?âWhat seest thou, ho? (Addressing a Soldier stationed in a tree above him.) Soldier. Nothing, my lord, but people from the city Hurrying this way. Joab. Look not on them, fool: fix Thine eyes upon the south. Soldier. I do, my lord. Joab. What seest thou toward the Prince's pillar? Soldier. Nothing. Joab. On that same open height beyond it? Soldier. Nothing. Joab. Well, nail thine eyes there.âWill the old man's prayer Stretch out till doom? Benaiah, we lose time; We should be now beyond Bahurim. Ben. Be patient; The stroke was bitter, and his heart seemed fraught Almost to bursting. Joab. Better rive at once, Than meet the tender mercies of his son By loitering here. By Heaven, I'll rouse himâ Ben. Hold, Hold, Joab! People. Stand aside!âBack there!âThe King! (King David comes forward among the People: Enter Hushai, with his garments rent; he falls to the ground, and clasps the King's feet.) Hush. God save my lord the King! Live I to see My master thus! the Light, the Rock of Israel! K. Dav. Once, Hushai, once the candle of the Lord Beamed on my head, and, like a shadowing rock, His buckler sheltered me. Thou seest me, now, Dark and defenceless; all my leprous sins Wrathfully visited upon my people. First People. What will become of us? Second People. Alas! alas! Heaven hath forsaken us! Third People. Woe, woe, alas! Joab. (going among them.) Peace with your howling! Peace! or ye shall feast The wild beasts of the wilderness.âMy lord, We linger here while death is at our heels. K. Dav. Hushai. Hush. Command thy servant. K. Dav. Turn thou back: Mix with his council: seem as they. Thy words May blast Ahithophel's, whose malice, else, Will work our ruin. With us thou canst nought.â Abiathar and Zadok stay behind, By my commandment, with the Ark. To them Communicate what thou canst learn of import: They will despatch it to me by their sons, Where I shall wait them in the wilderness. Joab. Depart ere thou art seen. Hush. God guard the King, And bring him home to Zion. (Exit.) Soldier. (calling from the tree.) Joab,âmy lord,âI see the flash of arms On that same hill.âThe vanguard comesâand now The horsemen.â Joab. Make they for the city? Soldier. Straight. Joab. Enough; descend.âShall we advance? K. Dav. Is there conveyance for the household? Joab. None. People. Yes, Ziba's here with asses. Second People. Only two. Joab. (impatiently.) Therefore, my lord, behoves us haste. Suppose His horse o'ertake us in the open plain, Cumbered with women? K. Dav. Bid the Pelethites Take up the youngest. Place upon the beasts Michal and Bathsheba. Send forward some For mules and camels, if the villages Or fields can yield us any.âWhere's the Prophet? Joab. Yonder, with Solomon.âArt ready, Sir? K. Dav. Ittai, protect the rearward. Station one To bring intelligence.âCommand the signal. Joab. (to his trumpeter.) Sound. (Trumpet sounds: exeunt the King and People, guarded by the armed bands.) SCENE II. The palace: an antechamber of the council-hall: Officers of Absalom's Guard, Attendants, &amp;c., in waiting. First Off. Will their debate ne'er end? Second Off. No, by the proverb, Never: when gossip graybeards talk, the sun Stands still. Enter Hadad from the hall. Had. (to one of the Attendants.) What, is she come yet? Attend. No, my lord. Had. (aside.) This is His spite!â You bore the signet?âsaw the Princess? Attend. Yes, my lord. Had. Why didst thou not stay by her when thou saw'st The streets in tumult? Attend. I was bid depart. Had. O curse!â(Turns angrily into the hall.) First Off. What clouds the Syrian? What 's amiss, (To the Attendant.) That Hadad bites his lip with such a frown? Attend. The Princess, Sir, is missing. Officers. Missing! Ha! (They gather round him.) But how? Attend. It happened thus. Imploring leave To come unto her father, he despatched Permission by his signet; but she came not, Though she had thrice entreated him with tears. It since appears, refusing all attendance, Except a slave, she went into the streets, And has not since been heard of. First Off. When was this? Attend. About the hour of twilight. First Off. 'T is dark night: (Looking out.) The city 's in confusion: she may suffer Some shameful outrage. Attend. That is feared indeed: Bagoas raves, and tears his hair, and Hadadâ Re-enter Hadad. Had. Brave gallants of the guard, the King commands Ye follow me. The Princess Tamar 's lost, This riotous night, we fear, amidst the streets. Ride six of you, for life, to every gate, And bid them, in the King's name, suffer none Pass outward.âScatter through the streets your comrades; Pierce sharply through the people;âscan the crowds.â If ye espy her, send me instant news To Zion gate by Gihon. On the bridge 'Twixt the two cities I will post myself. Away! (Exeunt Officers of the Guard.) (To one of the Attendants.) âCome hither. Know'st thou that dark alley Behind the Market-place? Attend. I do, my lord. Had. Run thither. Near a lattice thou wilt see A low, dark man, in a Scribe's gaberdine, Devoutly searching Moses, by a lamp Niched in the wall. Say Hadad's treasure 's lost,â The Princess,âlost in the unruly streets, And spirited, perhaps, into some den Of mischief. Bid him search, and come to me Upon the western bridge o'er Gihon. Fly! (Exit Attendant.) Offâoffâdisperse yourselves in every quarter:â If ye hear tidings, haste to me.âStay thou The King's forthcoming.âHe shall be enriched, Who first salutes me with intelligence. (Exeunt.) SCENE III. The council-hall. Absalom, Ahithophel, Manasses, Malchiah, Hushai, and others, in debate: Ahithophel speaking. Ahith. My lord, you know them not;âyou wear, to-day, The diadem, and hear yourself proclaimed With trump and timbrel Israel's joy, and deem Your lasting throne established. Canst thou bless, Or blast, like Him who rent the waters, clave The rock, whose awful clangor shook the world When Sinai quaked beneath his majesty? Yet Jacob's seed forsook this thundering Guide, Even at the foot of the astonished mount!â If benefits could bind them, wherefore flames The Ammonitish spoil upon thy brows, While David's locks are naked to the night dew? Canst thou transcend thy father? Is thy arm Stronger than his who smote from sea to sea, And girt us like a band of adamant?â Trust not their faith. Thy father's root is deep: His stock will bourgeon with a single sun; And many tears will flow to moisten him.â Pursue, this night, or ruin will o'ertake thee. Ab. What say'st thou, Hushai? Speak to this, once more. Hush. I listen to my lord Ahithophel, As to a heaven-instructed oracle; But what he urges more alarms my fears. Thou seest, O King, how night envelopes us: Amidst its perils, whom must we pursue? The son of Jesse is a man of war, Old in the field, hardened to danger, skilled In every wile and stratagem; the night More welcome than the day. Each mountain path He treads instinctive as the ibex; sleeps, Moistened with cold, dank drippings of the rock, As underneath the canopy. Some den Will be his bed to-night. No hunter knows Like him, the caverns, cliffs, and treacherous passes; Familiar to his feet, in former days, As 'twixt the Court and Tabernacle! What! Know ye not how his great heart swells in danger, Like the old lion's from his lair by Jordan?â Beware of him, by night, while chafed with anger. Surprisal!âWhile we talk, they lurk in ambush, Expectant of their prey: the Cherethites, And those bloody-thirsty Gittites, crouch around him, Like evening wolves: fierce Joab darts his eyes, Keen as the leopard's, out into the night, And curses our delay; Abishai raves; Benaiah, Ittai, and the Tachmonite, And they, the mighty three, who broke the host Of the Philistines, and from Bethlehem well Drew water, when the King but thirsted, now, Raven like beasts bereaved of their young.â We go not after boys, but the Gibborim, Whose bloody weapons never struck but triumphed. Malchi. It were a doubtful quest. Hush. Hear me, O King. Go not to night, but summon, with the dawn, Israel's ten thousands; mount thy conquering car, Surrounded by innumerable hosts, And go, their strength, their glory, and their King, Almighty to the battle; for what might Can then resist thee? Light upon this handful, Like dew upon the earth; or, if they bar Some city's gates against thee, let the people Level its puny ramparts, stone by stone, And cast them into Jordan. Thus my lord May bind his crown with wreaths of victory, And owe his kingdom to no second arm. Ahith. O blindness! lunacy! Hush. I would retire; Ye have my counsel. Ahith. Would thou hadst not come, To linger out with thy pernicious talk The hours of action. Hush. Wise Ahithophel, No longer I'll offend thee. Please the Kingâ (Absalom waves him to resume his seat.) Ahith. By all your hopes, my lord, of life and glory, I do adjure thee shut thine ears to him! His counsel 's fatal, if not treacherous. I see its issue, clearly as I see The badge of royalty,ânot long to sit Where now it sparkles, if his words entice thee.â Never was prudence in my tongue, or now.â Blanched as I am, weak, withered, winter-stricken, Grant but twelve thousand men, and I'll go forth. Weary, weak-handed, what can they, if taken, Now, in their first alarm? Ab. Were this resolved, We would not task thy age. What think ye, Sirs? Manass. My lord, the risk is great: a night assault Deprives us of advantage from our numbers, Which in the open field insure success; And news of a disaster blown about, And magnified, just now, when all are trembling, Might lose a Tribe, might wound us fatally. Hushai's advice appears most prudent. Ahith. Fate! Malchi. I think so too, my lord. Others. And I. And I. Ahith. Undone! Ab. The council are agreed, this once, Against you, and with them the King accords. Ahith. (stretching his hands toward Absalom.) Against thyselfâthy throneâthy lifeâthy all!â Darkness has entered thee,âconfusion waits thee,â Death brandishes his dart at thee, and grins At thy brief diadem!âFarewell! Farewell!â Remember me!âI'll not be checked and rated,â Branded with treason,âsee my hoary hairs Hooted and scoffed at, were they spared, indeed, For such indignity.âThou 'lt follow soon. (Exit.) Ab. Or win or lose, we walk not by thy light. Malchi. The old man's strangely moved. Manass. His fury seemed Prophetical. Ab. The council is dissolved, Here to assemble in the morning early, To order for our absence. Leave us now To private business. Counsellors. Save our lord the King. (Exeunt.) SCENE IV. The bridge over Gihon by the corner of Millo, between the upper and lower city: illuminations seen on the housetops: sounds of nocturnal riot and confusion in the streets: Hadad walking impatiently backwards and forwards on the bridge. Distant shouts. Had. (listening.) Mouthed brutes!âKing Absalom!âKing Log!âI care notâ Zion sanctissime!âHow bloodily The fires of jubilee flash to the clouds!â Or wind, or thunder's mustering! Their pale faces, Huddled upon the housetops, look like ghosts Come fresh from battle. Yea, were our grim confines Peopled, polluted with a herd like this, They were infernal. Thieves, beggars, bravoes, base Nethinims, harlots, tattered prodigals Flock from their holes to shout for Absalom! The filth of JebusâHa! what cry is that? (Listens anxiously.) Where can they loiter?âShould some ruffian clasp Her peerless beauty! Well, His sanctitude Suffers:âthere 's comfort. Hark! a rabblement Hoots this way.âLet me shun their drunken madness. (Retires into the shade of Millo: enter a Crowd from the lower city, shouting.) First Crowd. Hurrah for Absalom! King Absalom! Second Crowd. Down with the Graybeard! Third Crowd. Down with the Giant-queller! Fourth Crowd. Hold, Sirs,âhold, while I chant a canticle Indited for next Feast of Tabernacles, On that same doughty feat. Fifth Crowd. (drunk.) A murrain take Your canticles! Cry, âLong live Absalom!â Fourth Crowd. Whom have we there, my masters?âSee ye not? Bolt upright by the wall?âRabbi, who art thou? Emerge, I say:âcome from the land of shadows: Art thou for Absalom? Had. Ay. Fifth Crowd. Then show thyself. Had. I'm stationed by the King. Crowd. Molest him not; He says he 's of our party. Fifth Crowd. Let him shout. (Approaches Hadad.) Uplift thy voice. Wast thou born dumb? Crowd. Look! look! What throng is that by David's Tower? Second Crowd. Hurrah! (Rushes up toward Zion: all follow.) Had. (resuming his station on the bridge.) What nightmare sits on them! They might have groped The Red Sea caves, the womb of Caucasus, The den of HiddekelâHa! Maugrabin! Maugrabin looks from behind an angle of the neighbouring wall, and enters. Hast found her?âSpeak!â Maug. No track of her. Had. Out, Incubus! Where hast thou idled? Maug. By Trismegistus! in this half short hour I 've borne my clay so spitefully about, That eyes which saw me doubted if they saw Substance or shadow. Every den of mischief, Cavern of booty,âevery partlet roost, Ha! ha! ha! compassed by these holy wallsâ I 've peeped into, and sworn by SamaÃ«l Hot night-caps if they touch a plume of her. No fear:âthey know the Fowler! Had. (after a moment's thought) Follow. (Exit hastily.) Maug. Whew! Eloim gabbathi, Asmody! (Exit after.) SCENE V. The court of the Tabernacle on Mount Zion, lighted by a fire upon the altar of burnt-offerings: the interior of the sanctum partially visible through the smoke of the incense burning there: Zadok and Abiathar standing by the altar. Abi. The night frowns darkly, and may burst in storm Before our sons o'ertake the King. How, then, Cross ruffled Jordan with the helpless household? Zad. Look not to me for cheering. Am not I Dark as thyself? Abi. But thou didst charge the youths So straitly to pass o'er. Zad. So Hushai bade. Enter Tamar, attended by two ancient Jews. Tam. O, holy Priests! O, blessed Tabernacle! Zadok,âAbiathar,âwill ye protect me? Zad. (supporting her.) Protect thee, Princess!âthou art with sure friends. Whence comest thou? Tam. I know notâO! I know not. Jew. We rescued her from villains. Zad. Merciful! What measure hath this dreadful day of wrath! Jew. We met her in a dark and lonely place, West of Damascus' gate, dragged by two ruffians, Her mouth close bound. Perceiving us approach, They snatched the caul and circlet from her head, Tore from her arms and neck the costly gems, And plunged into the darkness. Zad. Blest be He Whose mercy guided you!âHow cam'st thou thus Exposed?âKnow ye? (to the Jews.) Jew. Hearing the Ark returned, She bent her steps this way, to seek of you Intelligence and comfort. In the dusk And crowded streets, losing her sole attendant, And borne amidst the tumult, she was seized By those same wretches, her pretended guides. Zad. Ye 've saved the Princess Tamar. Let me know Your worthy names. Jew. Barak and Mahlon, kinsmen, Of Omri's house. Zad. The deed shall be rewarded, If righteousness return. But leave the maid,â We watch before the altar,âsafer here, In presence of the Lord, than with an host. Tam. Yes, leave me, leave me, friends. Jew. Farewell! may prayers And sacrifice avert the threatened judgments. (Exeunt Jews.) Tam. O, tell me, where is David?âI beheld him Barefoot and weepingâOr was that a dream?â Yourselvesâthe Levitesâweeping round the Ark? Zad. Ah! that it were a dream! Tam. What hath befallen us?â O, answer, ere I grow quite wild. Zad. David is driven forth. Tam. Where? where? Abi. We know not. Zad. Nor where, nor how: it fell upon our heads Like sudden thunder. Tam. Were I but with him!â Ye know not where he went?âO, doth he live?â Have they not murdered him?â (The Priests whisper together.) âEnough! he is not!â Zad. Hearken, Princess, For we may trust thee. David lives. He fled Toward Jordan, promising to wait for tidings In a concerted placeâ Tam. But will he scape? Zad. If he pass o'er to-night; and both our sons Are sped to warn him. Tam. Did ye urge?âimplore him? Abi. We counselled him, and he is wise of heart. Zad. Calm your perturbed spirits now: repose Upon the Lord. His promises sustain Our fainting hopes: His sacred presence dwells Still in the Sanctuary, and forbids Despair. Yes, when the Ark resumed its place, The Glory settled 'twixt the Cherubim With undiminished lustre. Tam. Then, there's hopeâ But O!âmy guilty father!â(Weeps bitterly.) Zad. Despair not: join with us in supplications. Tam. Why did they spare me! O, that I had died When death was near! Zad. Disparage not thy rescuer; Jehovah hears thee.âKneel for his offences, For Israel's, whose portentous sins may tempt A retribution terrible and final. Enter the Sanctuary, and uplift Thy sorrowing heart, more prevalent than incense. (They lead her into the Tabernacle.) SCENE VI. Without the vail of the court: Hadad attended by several of Absalom's guard: Maugrabin, at a little distance in the gloom, watching them. Had. I saw her there: she entered with the Priests. Go in, and say the King commands her presence. (The Guards pass into the court of the Tabernacle: Hadad remains, intently looking through the vail.) Lo! lo!âthe bloody shrine of sacrifice,â The Cherub-tissued curtains,âthe seven branches, Revealing through the censer's smothering fume The dim magnificence!âEach implement As he prescribed.âThese must be symbols, types Of things hereafter. Maug. (muttering to himself.) Tempt him, if thou wiltâ Pry in his secrets till devouring fire Break out upon theeâYea, within the snuff Of that detested incense! How the wreaths Begin to curl about him!âI'll not risk Annihilation. (Exit.) Had. Wherefore should I tremble?â Mortals have gazed unblinded,âMoses saw The lightning of his glory pass.âBut Iâ How could I front the terrible array, If yonder vail should part?âOne flash might end me!â What holds them parleying? This abhorred smoke Is worse than Sodom,âevery breath I draw Seems mortal agony.âLeave her I will notâ Re-enter Guards, with Tamar. Mean ye to stay eternity? First Guard. We stay not. Had. Peace! Second Guard. (aside to his comrade.) Look how convulsed and pale he is; And see, his breast is bloody. Had. (fiercely.) Get behind me. (Throws his mantle across his breast, and conducts Tamar out, followed by the rest: she neither speaks, nor regards him.) ACT V. SCENE I. Mahanaim, near the principal gate of the city. The People collected: supplies of all kinds entering. King David standing with Joab, Benaiah, and other Captains upon the wall, by the ascent of the gate. First Citizen. But will the battle be to-day? Second Cit. You see, The Captains are arrayed in proof; the bands In readiness, awaiting but the King. First Cit. Where lies the foe? Second Cit. Hard by the wood of Ephraim. The Wood of Ephraim was near the city of Mahanaim in the country of Gilead, in the tribe of Gad. It received this appellation from a slaughter of the Ephraimites by Jephtha, which happened there. Enter an Old Man. Old Man. Direct mine eyesâwhere is he? which is he? Third Cit. Whom seek'st thou? Old Man. The Anointed,âthe Sweet Singer. Third Cit. Behold him yonder, on the wall, 'Midst the Gibborim.âSeest thou not?âthere, father, Him in the robe. Old Man. Is that the King?âO, heavens! First Cit. Why dost thou weep? Old Man. How matted all his beard!â Ah! how neglected!âhow his reverend locks Are scattered!âBrothers, is it,âis it he? Second Cit. He hath not trimmed his beard, nor changed his raiment, Nor slept, since he forsook Jerusalem. Old Man. Are those the Captains?âWhat helmed chief is that, Whose face is as the ravening eagle's beak? Second Cit. 'T is Joab. Old Man. Blest be Joab! hearts of flint, And hands of steel, are needful now. Second Cit. See, see! (King David and the Captains descend into the gate: the People press nearer.) K. Dav. Bring forth my harness.âJoab and Abishai, Lead ye the vanguard by the southern gate, And wait me in the plain.âMy spear and harness! People. (many voices.) O, go not forth, my lord,âO, go not!âGo not! Joab. If I might speak? K. Dav. Say on. Joab. Thou know'st the time Is perilous, and we can jeopard nothing. Behold, my lord,âthis city 's strong for siege, High-towered, and watered, plentiful in corn Poured in by Gilead, provender, and kine. Let us thy servants strike the battle now, And if we fail, my lord shall succour us From out the city, or receive us here Where we can baffle them. But if my lord The King go forth and meet mischance to-day, What hope is left us? People. (crying tumultuously.) No, no, no!âThe King Shall not go forth.âNo matter if we perish;â Ten thousand of us, to the King, is nought;â They care not for us.âIf the King be slain, Israel is lost.âMy lord shall not go forthâ Joab. You hear the People. Ben. All thy servants pray. K. Dav. Well, what ye think is best, be done. Joab. (unsheathing his sword.) Advance The banner. K. Dav. Hear me, Joab,âhear, Abishai,â Ye sons of Zeruiah, mark my charge In presence of the People!âFor my sake, Deal gently with him,âeven Absalom,â Touch not his life.âWhat! is he not my blood? Joab. God save the King!âAbishai pass thou south; I issue by this portal. K. Dav. Benaiah! Ben. My lord. (They retire from the hearing of the People.) K. Dav. (after a moment's pause.) Thou hast a son? Ben. Two valiant sons, my lord. K. Dav. Thou know'stâknow'st what it wereâ O, think on thisâIf he be taken,âshield him From their wild fury.âEvery heart is steeled, And whetted to a murderous edge.âBenaiah, I would yield crown and life, ere see my son Hurried to his award.âDire, dire for him Is this arbitramentâ Ben. Wet not your cheeks, My gracious lord; it doth unman my heart, Which I would wear, to-day, like my habergeon. K. Dav. Then swear to me. Ben. I swear. K. Dav. Enough, enough. (The King resumes his station in the gate: the squadrons pass out before him.) SCENE II. The tent of Absalom: Absalom, armed except his helmet, and Hadad. Ab. Methought I stood again, at dead of night, In that rich sepulchre, viewing, alone, The wonders of the place. My wandering eyes Resting upon the costly sarcophage Reared in the midst, I saw therein a form Like David; not as he appears,âbut young, And ruddy. In his lovely-tinctured cheek The vermil blood looked pure and fresh as life In gentle slumber. On his blooming brow Was bound the diadem. But, while I gazed, The phantasm vanished, and my father lay there, As he is now, his head and beard in silver, Sealed with the pale, fixed impress of the tomb. I knelt and wept. But when I thought to kiss My tears from off his reverend cheek, a voice Cried, âImpious! hold!ââand suddenly there stood A dreadful and refulgent form before me, Bearing the Tables of the Law. Had. Rare phantoms! Ab. It spake not, moved not, but still sternly pointed To one command, which shone so fiercely bright It seared mine eyeballs. Presently, I seemed Transported to the desolate, wild shore Of Asphaltites, night, and storm, and fire Astounding me with horror. All alone I wandered; but where'er I turned my eyes, On the bleak rocks, or pitchy clouds, or closed them, Flamed that command. Had. How o'erwrought fancy coins! Ab. Then suddenly I sunk down, down, methought, Ten thousand thousand cubits to a wide And travelled way, walled to the firmament On either side, and filled with hurrying nations; Hurrying they seemed, or hurried by some spell, Toward a portentous adamantine gate Towering before us to the empyrean. Beside it Abraham sat, in reverend years And gracious majesty, snatching his Seed From its devouring jaws. When I approached, He groaned forth, âParricide!ââand stretched no aidâ To me, alone, of all his children. Then, What flames, what howling, fiery billows caught me, Like the red ocean of consuming cities, And shapes most horrid; all, methought, in crowns Scorching as molten brass, and every eye Bloodshot with agony, yet none had power To tear them off. With frantic yells of joy, They crowned me too, and, with the pang, I woke. Had. 'T was time, indeed. But this is empty nothing, And should not shake a constant mind. Ab. Not shake From its determined purpose; but may move Affection, memory, with images Of things, loved, mourned, or feared. That heart, methinks, Were of strange mould which kept no cherished print Of earlier, happier times, when life was fresh, And love and innocence made holy-day Within the bosom, destined soon to know The jar of sterner inmates; or, that owned No transient sadness, when a dream, or glimpse Of fancy, touched past joys. Had. I held your soul Fixed with a gaze too steadfast on the sun Of glory, e'er to cast such looks behind. Ab. And, Hadad, I had thought it strange in thee, But that thou never knew'st a parent's love, To hold so lightly what has cost me more To quell, than all I can confront in arms. Were I unmoved by such exhaustless bounty, Heaped, loaded on me, since my earliest thought, Till traitors poisoned him, I were a Fiend. Enter an Officer of the Guard. Off. My lord, the scouts bring tidings of the foe, Skirting the left-hand wood. Ab. What form of march, What numbers show they? Off. Three squadrons come.â Joab, Benaiah, and the Cherethites, (Known by their scarlet plumage,) make the vaward,â The white scarfs of the Gittites next appear:â The third was too remote for ken. Ab. What numbers? Off. Some third, or fourth of ours, my lord. Ab. So bold? Yet that I looked for; well I know their temper. Saw theyâmy father? Off. No, my lord, No port that did resemble him. Ab. 'T is well: Command my chariot to the tent: go, bid The Captain be at his pavillion straightway. (Exit Officer.) This stern defiance arms my soul again. So David front me not, these carrion birds, So fond to gorge, and baited to the carnage, Shall taste their fill, to-day, by Astaroth! Now for my daughter;âTamar! ho! (Partly withdrawing the inner curtain of the tent.) Enter Tamar. âMy child, Since thou wouldst follow, I have ordered thus.â The battle being nearâ Tam. O! say not soâ Ab. Peace! hear me. Tam. Father! father! on my knees I do conjure theeâ Ab. (sternly.) Tamar! Tam. By the love You bear me! by my grandsire's age! by all Heaven's fearful threateningsâ Ab. Hush! no more of this! Know'st thou thy father?âName it not again, But hear me. Twelve brave horsemen of the guard Will be your escort, with our trusty Kinsman. Two dromedaries of the fleetest, girt For thee and Hadad, if the day go hard, Will bear ye from the danger.âMark me, Prince; Keep well aloof; come not too near the turmoil; Move with the conflict; make the wood your skreen. If we speed well, I'll meet ye here; if not, Stint not your riding, heed not food nor rest Till Talmai's palace shelter her.âBeware! Nor swerve a tittle!âAnd I charge thee, Hadad, Be not o'er curious to inspect the strife; Thou canst not aid it; and the trust thou hast Is more to me than victory. Had. My lord, I yield to strong necessity, or else Nothing should sever me from thee to-day. Ab. We need thee not.âFarewell, my daughter. (Kisses her.) Go; Make ready for the saddle.âRide with me Along the files, then, Hadad to thy charge. (Tamar receives her father's salute weeping, and retires. Absalom and Hadad go out together.) SCENE III. The forest of Ephraim: the tents of a company of Ishmaelites: women seen under the trees: Adah singing by a tent door. Ad. Greenly flourish, fragrant Mountain! Ishmael's free-born offspring know Every shade and gushing fountain, Where thy precious spices grow. Laden with the odorous tribute, When the gums have ceased to fall, Perfumes for the Priestly censer, Sweets for Memphis' regal hall, First we greet, on Zion's summit, Haughty Judah's lion King, Then to Nile's expecting borders Gilead's rifled treasures bring. What, though whirlwinds sweep our deserts, Sands and death-clouds stalk the air? Bloody treasons never frights us, Royal mandates slay not there. We no King, no Master worship; Hagar's God alone on high: He the tameless spirit gave us, Spread the desert, hung the skyâ Ha! Kedar, wherefore in such haste? Enter a Young Ishmaelite. Y. Ish. O, Adah! The plain is full of warriors: two great hosts Are rushing to the battle. Ad. Heavens! to battle! Enter Sarah, from the tent. Sar. What 's that? Y. Ish. Sarah, two armies are in conflict; Covering the plain with horses, arms, and ensigns. Why, heard ye not the trumpets? Women. (collecting about them.) NoâNoâNo. Sar. But where? Y. Ish. West of the wood. While at the spring Filling our water-skins, we heard a blast, And trampling, hollow sounds, that shook the earth, And, pushing to the forest edge, we saw Squadrons approaching 'gainst a mighty host Camped in the plain, a countless multitude. O, Adah, such a glorious sight! shields flashed, Spears shook, and arrows flew! Sar. But who are they? Y. Ish. We know not; but Abimilech declared The battle promised blood. He says the spoil Will more enrich us than our spices, more Than thrice our annual journey into Gilead. Dumah is with the camels; all the rest Are watching to despoil the slain. I came, Lest ye should fear mischance. Ad. Alas! alas! Y. Ish. O, could you see how dazzling bright their arms, How square and firm they move, flashing the sun Back from the brazen ridges,âand behold The warrior in the car majestic rule His bounding steeds, white as the noonday cloud! Enter Tamar, pale, and leaning upon Hadad, followed by two of the Guard. Had. We crave your hospitality, good people; This lady 's faint, and cannot keep the saddle. Grant her the shelter of your tent awhile. Sar. Enter in peace. Ad. Sweet lady, let me aid thee. (Adah conducts Tamar into the tent.) Sar. Belike she 's frighted? Heard ye of the battle? Had. We have. Sar. Know ye what hosts they be? Had. 'T is Israel. Sar. Whom strive they with, my lord? Had. Their ancient, cruel, Inveterate, and indomitable foe, Each other. Sar. Holy God! Had. (to the Guard.) Keep all together. Are your comrades near? Guard. Stationed behind the tents, my lord. Had. 'T is well: Be ready to mount instantly; and hark, I have a word for all of ye. (Hadad and Guard disappear behind the tents.) Sar. Isaac with Isaac hosts, and Ishmael reaps The bloody spoil! Thus Heaven's decreesâ Enter Adah. Ad. O, mother! Never did I behold such beauty! sure, She must be some born Princess, all her vest Is twined with gold, and every loop Is fastened with a gem. But O! such grief, Such sighs, it wrings my heart! Women. Who can she be? Ad. Her girdle, sandals, bracelets, glistering hood Of checklaton, are wondrous; and a cord Of rarest rubies twice engirds her neck, And falls betwixt her bosom white as wool. But O, her lovely face was never peered. She looks, methinks, as Pharaoh's daughter did, When we beheld her pleasuring on the Nile. Sar. Here comes the stranger:ânoble too. Ad. Question him, mother dear:âask who they are, And what hath chanced to them; 't is, sure, some sad, Sad accident. Enter Hadad. Sar. How can we serve my lord, Or yon fair lady? Had. Let us rest a space. Sar. Yea, but she droops, my lord. I would we might Administer: her tears and beauty touch My daughter nearly. Ad. Ah! might not some comfortâ Had. Nothing: intrude not on her. Sar. If we knew Her ailment, doubt not we could balm it, Sir: Adah has soothed a wilder mood, believe me. Had. Her friends are in the battle. Trouble not Anxiety ye cannot tranquillize. Sar. Her friends may conquer: why doth she despair? Had. They may, they must. But leave her, dame. Y. Ish. Here 's Dumah. Enter an Ishmaelite. Sar. What of the battle, Dumah? heard ye aught? Ish. I durst not leave the camels long; but ere I came, I ran and looked, just looked. Had. What saw'st thou? Ish. Host mixed with host confused, The flash and shock of arms, shouts, groans, and peals Of shrilling trumpets, and a dreadful car Hurled by two steeds fiercer than unicornsâ Had. Who yielded? Ish. None; but many fell. Had. You know notâWould I could a glance there!â Tamar appears at the door of the tent. Ha! what, my love? Tam. What tidings? Had. Nothing decisive. Thou shalt hear the first. Go in, sweet:âcalm your agitated spirits. Tam. Ah! Hadad, thou mightst have prevented this. Had. Nay, have I not assured thee how I strove, Entreated, kneeled to shake the Prince's purpose?â His will is moveless as the world's fixed centre. Tam. Had I but known it!âNow, it matters not Who wins or loses. Had. Could I play the traitor? Betray his secrets?âThat had sundered us For ever, blasted all my hopes in thee.â Go in, love; thou shalt know whate'er betides. (Tamar retires.) How long is it, since you beheld the fieldâ Enter two Ishmaelites with spoils. But here 's of fresher dieâRings, daggers, girdles,â (Examining the booty.) Or friends', or foes',âthey speak a common tongue.â Bring them not near this tent.âHow goes the field? First Ish. The storm drives south. Had. Ha! south? Second Ish. We gathered these Where the first blows were struck. Had. Saw ye a chariot? First Ish. The conflict there, is like the desert whirlwind,â Darts, arrow-flights, and clashing, eager spears, And desperate combatants are huddled there.â The dust-wreaths fly.âThe ramping chargers foam Like yesty waters,âwhizzing javelins glance From their broad frontlets and brass poitrels, like Hail from a rock. Their master's buckler takes A tempest. Had. What! the battle pushes south? First Ish. We won These spoils where it first closed, and now it rages Further toward Succoth, all between thick strown With carcasses. All 's broken and confused. But, scattered through the field, you may espy, Far in the hostile ranks, the scarlet crests Of some who know their weapons well, and clear A bloody space around them.âTema! ha! Enter third Ishmaelite, with booty. How goes the strife? Third Ish. We left it at the direst. First Ish. How fares the car? Third Ish. The horses plunge and madden, But cannot stir the wheels, fast wedged by dead And living. Round them fights a furious ring, Like reckless lions. All their silver manes, And arched necks, when they rear, show bloody red. Fourth Ish. (entering while the last speaks.) They 're prostrate,âdead, I think,âI saw them fall. Had. What of their lord? Fourth Ish. O'er his fallen steeds he combats: His sword sweeps circles that the hardiest shun. Had. He cannot 'scape, then?âCan he 'scape? Fourth Ish. For thrice The car, I would not stand in it. Third Ish. 'T is o'er ere this: we came about, for fear Of skirmishers that struggled in the wood. Had. (walking aside.) 'T is odds he 's slain,âI know the cruel pack That bay him!âSoâI'll rid me of these fellows;â Alone with her, I may persuade,âIf not, I have her, and can curb her.âAll 's fulfilled!â And all shall be fulfilled! No more I climb Moriah till the frustrate covenant Leave her a salt-sown rock!âWhat if our foe Recover?âIs 't my fault?âHave I not thrust The parricidal brand into his bosom?â Come, what may come,âI'll trust my dear-bought guerdon To no hereafter. Fourth Ish. Lo!âthe Captain.âLo! Here comes Abimilech. Enter Abimilech, and several Ishmaelites, with a quantity of rich spoil. Abim. (perceiving Hadad.) Whom have we here? Third Ish. We found him when we came, Inquiring of the battle. Ad. (running to Abimilech.) Welcome, father. Abim. What stranger 's that? Ad. O, father, he hath brought A lady brave and beauteous as a Princess. Had. (saluting Abimilech.) Peace. Abim. Peace. Had. I prithee, Chief, How fortunes, now, the field? Abim. (after a glance of scrutiny.) The eagles smell it. Had. But is the battle lost? Abim. Or lost, or won, 'T is stricken; and the wreck of hosts is strown As after whirlwinds. Had. Heard ye of the Chief Who fought from out a chariot with white steeds? Abim. He 's finished. Had. Ha! how know'st thou that? Abim. I saw him lifeless. Had. Art thou sure? Abim. If to be bored with three tough darts be sure. Had. Beseech ye, come this way: some friends are near, To whom the news were murderous.âThen he 'scaped not? Abim. He fled upon a mule, and disappeared, And had escaped, I thought, though hotly followed, Taking the wood when met upon the plain. But, as I crossed the forest far within, A trumpet roused me. Hearing earnest voices, I made that way, through a close brake, to spy The danger. Near the thicket's verge, I saw A concourse round an oak. Intent they seemed On some great spectacle. Opening anon, I saw him, bleeding, and transpierced with darts, Borne past me on their shields. Had. What was his vesture? Abim. Fragments of purple hung about his shoulders. Had. His arms? his helm? Abim. Unhelmed his head, and bare; His breastplate sparkled, studded, and engrailed With flowers of gold, pure burnish of Damascus. Had. His statureâ Abim. Palm-like tall, of noblest aspect; With ample locks that trailed upon the ground. Had. Let Hades rise to meet him reverently, For not a Kingly Phantom there sustained A heart more regal! Abim. Yea; though he miscarried, He well deserves a valiant memory, And fought it like a son of David. Had. Dead!â We must begone. Prithee, speak not of this Till we 're away.âFirst I'll despatch yon horsemen. (Aside.) Abim. (approaching the Ishmaelites.) Come, bustle, bustle, mates:âday wastes,âand, with The moon, we must be making for the Desert. Had. (behind the tents.) Mount, Sirs,âyour master needs ye,âpush amain,â Spur,âstrike into the field the shortest way;â Where'er ye see him grapple to his side.â I'll guard the Princess.â(Returning.) So; we'll further pierce The forest, that they trace us not. At worst, Our dromedaries can, with ease, outstrip them. (Approaching Sarah's tent.) Princess, we must begone. Tam. (appearing.) Ha!âWhat? Had. But this;â Your father has retreated. Tam. Is he safe?â Alive?âunhurt?â Had. So they who saw, report. Tam. Thanks, gracious Heaven! Had. Come, sweet, We must obey him, now.âThe conflict 's o'er;â Take comfort. Bid we these good friends farewell. Tam. Adieu, kind-hearted Adah! Were my fate Less cruel, we would not part so. Keep this For Tamar's sake. (Gives her a ring.) Ad. Farewell! farewell!âThe stars Prove kinder to you. Sar. Go in peace. Tam. Farewell to all! (The Ishmaelites follow Tamar and Hadad to the rear of the encampment.) SCENE IV. A sequestered place in the wood, surrounded with thick, dark trees: a fountain, near a cave. Enter Hadad and Tamar. Tam. But why dismount here?ânight approaches, Hadad:â See, the slant sunbeams gild but the tall tree-tops, And evening sables all below. The wood Grows drear and dismal. Had. We must await the Guard.âCome, sit with me Beside this mossy fountain: all is still here:â List the sweet birds nestling among the boughs; All else soft silence: tumult comes not here. Sit by this crystal spring awhile. Tam. No, no, I will not sit; we must not linger here. My father bade us haste: we disobey, And risk his anger.âKeep your hands from me. Had. But whither shall we fly? Tam. Where he commanded. Had. To vassal Geshur!âWho can there protect us? Or in Damascus' tributary walls?â Hear me, sweet Princess, bright star of my being, Fly, fly with me beyond this wretched scene Of civil strife, and never-ending discord, To realms of quietness, where we may dwell In lasting peace. Tam. What mean'st thou? Had. Look on Israel Deluged in blood,âthe Royal House divided,â The Tribes in faction,âpeace for ever fled! What harbour here for love? O, fly with me: I will conduct thee to a brighter sphere. Tam. Forsake my country?âfather?âNever! Had. Then Hadad 's lost, and all our cherished hopes A faithless dream. Tam. These sad clouds may disperse. Had. Thou know'st notâAh!âI would have spared that pangâ Tam. Ha! Had. Hadad can never tread these bounds again, Deemed (O, how falsely!) treason's foul abettor, Since he is gone who only could attest His spotless innocence. Tam. (in alarm.) What mean'st thou? Had. Later witnesses reportâ Alas!â Tam. My father?âGracious Heaven!â Mean'st thou my father?â Had. Dearest Tamar,âIsrael's Hopeâ Sleeps with the valiant of the years of old. (Tamar, with a convulsed cry, bursts into tears: Hadad seems to weep.) The bond is rent that knit thee to thy country. Thy father's murderers triumph. Turn not there, To see their mockery. Let us retire, And, piously, on some far, peaceful shore, With mingled tears embalm his memory. Tam. (clasping her hands.) Am I an orphan? Had. Nay, much-loved Princess, not while this Fond heartâ Tam. Misguided father!âHadst thou but listenedâ Hadst thou believedâ Had. But now, what choice is left? What refuge hast thou but thy faithful Hadad? Tam. Oneâstrickenâhoary head remains. Had. The slayer of thy parent!âWouldst thou go Where obloquy and shame and curses load him? Hear him called rebel? Tam. All is expiated now. Had. Tamar,âwilt thou forsake me. Tam. I must go to David. Had. (aside.) Cursed thought!â Think of your lot,âneglect, reproach, and scorn, For who will wed a traitor's offspring? All The proud will slight thee, as a blasted thing. Tam. O, wherefore this to me?â Conduct me henceâNay, instantly. Had. (in an altered tone.) Hold! hold! For thou must hear.âIf deaf to love, thou 'rt not To fearful ecstasy. (Tamar startled:âhe proceeds, but agitated and irresolute.) âConfide in meâ I can transport theeâO, to a paradise, To which this Canaan is a darksome span;â Beings shall welcomeâserve theeâlovely as Angels;â The Elemental Powers shall stoop;âthe Sea Disclose her wonders, and receive thy feet Into her sapphire chambers;âorbed clouds Shall chariot thee from zone to zone, while earth, A dwindled islet, floats beneath thee;âevery Season and clime shall blend for thee the garland.â The abyss of Time shall cast its secrets,âere The Flood marred primal nature,âere this Orb Stood in her station! Thou shalt know the stars, The houses of Eternity, their names, Their courses, destiny,âall marvels high. Tam. Talk not so madly. Had. (vehemently.) Speakâanswerâ Wilt thou be mine, if mistress of them all? Tam. Thy mien appals me;âI know not what I fear;â Thou wouldst not wrong me,âreft, and fatherless,â Confided to thee as a sacred trustâ Had. (haughtily.) My power Is questioned. Whom dost thou imagine me? Tam. Indeed, surpassed by nothing human. Had. Bah! Tam. O, Hadad, Hadad, what unhallowed thought So ruffles and transforms thee? Had. Still, still, Thou call'st me Hadad,âboy, worm, heritor Of a poor, vanquished, tributary King!â Then know me. Tam. Seraphs hover round me! Had. Woman!â(Struggling, as with conflicting emotions.) What thou so dotest onâthis formâwas Hadad'sâ But Iâthe SpiritâI, who speak through these Clay lips, and glimmer through these eyes,â Have challenged fellowship, equality, With Deathless Ones,âprescient Intelligences,â Who scorn Man and his molehill, and esteem The outgoing of the morning, yesterday!â I, who commune with thee, have dared, proved, suffered, In lifeâin deathâand in that state whose bale Is death's first issue! I could freeze thy blood With mysteries too terribleâof Hades!â Not there immured, for by my art I 'scaped Those confines, and with Beings dwelt of bright Unbodied essence.âCanst thou now conceive The love that could persuade me to these fetters?â Abandoning my powerâI, who could touch The firmament, and plunge to darkest Sheol, Bask in the sun's orb, fathom the green sea, Even while I speak itâhere to root and grow In earth again, a mortal, abject thing, To win and to enjoy thy love. Tam. (in a low voice of supplication.) Heaven! Heaven! Forsake me not! Had. First, in the city's crowded gate I saw thee, The memorable day thou camest from Geshur, A vermil blossom by thy father's side, Hailing Jerusalem with smiles and tears. Then, then I loved thee,âtender as thou wert;â I hung invisibly about thy stepsâ About thy bed,âI glided in thy dreams,â Filled them with sweet, voluptuous forms and phantoms, And watched thy glowing cheek and heaving bosom, While my bright visions stirred thy fancy. Happy Till that cursed Syrian, fresher than Adonis, Became thy inmate. No seducing dream, Illusion, art of mine, could reach thee more. Then, first, I knew agonies, scorpions, fire!â But mark,âI harmed him not,âensnared him not, Unlocked life's secret by no subtle spell. But mourning in a mountain solitude, Neighbouring Jerusalem, my luckless love And lowering destiny, your father's train Came forth to hunt. The Syrian from the rest Severing in keen pursuit, fell in with Outlaws Who followed, and with bloody daggers slew him, Even by the fountain where I mused unseen. Tam. (clasping her forehead.)â O, grace!âO, pity!â Had. Thou know'st the timeâremember'st wellâ't was night, Ere he returned,âere I returned,âfor I, From that day forth, have worn these lineaments. Tam. Confusion!â Had. While his quivering limbs Pressed the green sod, while pitying I surveyed His matchless beauty, nobly stern in death, And thought how dear those features were to thee, I dared the penalty;âfor thy sake dared Death, prison-house, and penal consequence, Denounced on the offence:âI linked myself To Hadad's form, and life's infirmities, My recompense, my only recompense, Thy love. Tam. Sorcerer! Fiend!â't is falsehood allâ Thou slew'st him. Had. Ha! are there not other means To free the spirit?âHad I marred him thus? (Draws aside his vesture, and displays two bleeding stabs upon his breast.) Tam. (covering her face.) O! Powers of Heaven! Had. Immedicable wounds, that thrill, and throb Hourly as with the mortal steel, and gush Fresh blood, when stronger passions shake my frame. No art can heal them, and no balm assuage.â O, if this sight constrain the tear of pity, How wouldst thou live to listen the dire torments, Must loose me from this flesh,âtoo deep to tell,â To which your death by poison, steel, or rack, Is a sweet noontide slumber. Tam. Wretched being! Had. Dost thou not pity me? Tam. Alas! alas! If 't be not guilt,âfor thou art capable Of misery past thought. Had. I love thee:â't is my only joy:â I 've paid to win thy love a sumless price:â Canst thou deny it me? (Approaching her.) Tam. Avoid meâleave me!â I sin, in talking with thee.âPardon, Heaven! I know not what I do. Had. Weep not, Nor fear, sweet Princess: I would make thee happy, Happier than mortal. Only bid me sprinkle Three crystal drops of this pure spring upon thee, And thou shalt live, unfading, tracts of years, And bloom, when all who stand to-day on earth, Are shapeless dust. (Scoops water from the fountain.) Tam. (recoiling.) Avaunt!âapproach me not!â Jehovah shelter me!âO, righteous Prophet! Had I obeyed theeâguilty and undone! Had. Why call'st thou on that name so oft, nor know'st Thyself abandoned? Hopest thou to escape His wrath, who visits on the children's head The father's guilt? Thy sire has angered him, And thou must suffer.âTake the good I offer: Thou hazardest no evil, and securest Almost immortal bliss.âWilt thou? Tam. No!âNo!âNo! Had. Strange obduracy! Thou art mine, thou seest:â Resigned to me in this vast wilderness,â Night, solitude, and silence all around,â With none to friend or help thee;âyet thou turnest From happiness beyond the lot of mortal, Beauty unfading, knowledge like the Angels', Glory, and sovereignty, and length of daysâ Thine eye relents,âthus, let me clasp a goddess! Tam. (springing backward.) Heart, hold thou firm! God look on me, For I am sore beset!âIf 't is my crime Not to have abhorred thee utterly, and sealed My ears like adamant, nor ventured, once, Exchange a thought,â't was difficult, alas! Seeing that form, and listening to a tongue Employed so oft in noblest eloquence, To realize thee foul, and reprobate,â Abandoned,âhating God,âcruelly bent To drag a frail, bereaved, unhappy creature, Down to thy own dark mansion-house of pain. But now I know thee, I abjure thee,âhate thee, More than unwittingly I loved. To God I cleave,âon God I callâ Had. (with demoniac violence.) No more,âwe'll argue after.âThou, at least, Shalt never bear the Incarnate Foe we fear. Tam. Father!âMost High!âBy every name!âO, snatch me! Flame round me!âO! for Jacob'sâDavid's sake!â (He drags her shrieking into the cavern; at the same moment a trumpet and voices heard in the wood.) First Voice. This way, this way. Second Voice. There stand their dromedaries. Third Voice. It issues from the cave. Enter Benaiah hastily, followed by a party of Cherethites. Ben. I know his beastâ Stand from the gorge!âGive light and weapon room! Some stout hearts follow me! (Enters the cavern, sword in hand, followed by several of the band: the rest gather round.) First Cher. Hark! hark!âWhat dire, unnatural yell was that? (They listen.) Some mortal conflict rages.âHeavenly Powers! What curses, howling, horrid blasphemy! Second Cher. 'T is like Gehenna! Third Cher. O, venture notâKeep backâ Accursed Spirits consort in these caves, Who craftily entice men in, and there Force them to kneel at their ensnaring altars. Second Cher. But should we leave our lord in peril? First Cher. No, By Heaven! Let 's in, and stand by him. (As others are entering, a Cherethite rushes out, pale and terrified.) Cherethites. What now?â What violence is doing?âSpeakâWhy stares Your hair?â Cherethite. O, go notâ't is too terribleâ Other Cherethites. What saw ye?âSpeak!â Cherethite. One like the Cherubim,â Dreadfully glistering,âwinged, and dazzling bright As lightning;âshooting from his bickering eyeballs Sparkles like arrows.âAll the cave 's a-blaze With red effulgence!âFoaming on the ground, A howling, withering, ghast, demoniac shape Curses, and gnashes, in death's agony. Third Cher. The Prophets keep us! Cherethite. Nothing kin to earth E'er looked such serpent rage, or battled so With death's strong pangs. (They all start.) Fourth Cher. What sound was that? Second Cher. It seemed a rush of wind from out the cave. First Cher. 'T was passing wings. Third Cher. I felt it; and methinks A sudden sweetness fills the air around us. First Cher. Ambrosial. It betokens some blest Presence. Second Cher. They come, they come. (Enter two of the band, dragging the body of Hadad from the cavern, which they drop, and recoil from.) First Cher. What hideous monster is it? Second Cher. Nothing human: Look how 't is blasted. Third Cher. What a hellish glare Is glazed upon those starting eyeballs! Second Cher. Damned. Enter Benaiah and others from the cavern, bearing Tamar, whom they place upon the turf by the spring. Ben. 'T is she, indeed, the Princess, but not dead. The color 's in her cheek, and see, she breathes. (Sprinkles water in her face.) Tam. (opening her eyes aghast.) No!âNo!âNo!â Ben. Look up, sweet lady:âbe not so affrighted:â We are thy friends,âthe servants of the King;â I am Benaiah,âthese are David's soldiersâ Tam. O, take me!âsave me!â (Sinks back.) Ben. Take courage, Princess,âHeaven hath rescued theeâ Behold!âarmed friends are round thee,âGod is nigh.â (To his followers.) Sound the recall,âcollect more strength about us;â And seize a mule, if any browse the glade.â GentlyâUndo her girdleâShe'll revive. (Trumpet sounds: some of the Cherethites disperse through the wood. Benaiah signs to the rest, who gather round him.) Comrades! yon grisly thing, that lies there seared, Is Hadad. He could blear our eyes, but not The great All-seeing. Strictly did I heed The Prophet's dark suggestions to the King, Imparted as they wayfared side by side, The night before we entered Mahanaim; Oft iterated, as when cruel doubts Afflict us. But, in the midmost watch last night, He stood beside my couch,âperplexed, perturbed;â Visions, he said, all pointing to the Syrian And this young Princess, vexed and baffled him, Shifting and indistinct as clouds or smoke, But all portentous. Some catastrophe He deemed at hand, thus darkly intimated; And bade me, in the Holy Name, not spare, If this day's battle brought him to my steel, And, haply, I should find him vulnerable. Either, said he, some Minister of Evil Has armed that Syrian with unearthly arts, Or else a Spirit has assumed his likeness. Strange signs, strange intimations he recounted, And said a dream had warned him to beware Of Asmodai, for that seductive Demon Was plotting in the midst of Israel. PERCY'S MASQUE, A DRAMA, IN FIVE ACTS. INTRODUCTION. Henry Percy, the son of Hotspur, found himself, when he emerged from childhood, bereft of friends, stripped of the possessions of his ancestors, and subsisting, in exile, upon the bounty of strangers. On the rupture of his family with Henry the Fourth, whom they had been instrumental in elevating to the throne, leaguing with Glendour and the Earl of Douglas, they published it as their intention to transfer the crown to Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March. This nobleman was the great-grandson of Lionel, Duke of Clarence, the third son of Edward the Third; and, besides representing an elder branch of the family than that from which Henry sprung, had been acknowledged by Richard the Second as his successor. The issue of their enterprise was the well-known battle of Shrewsbury. The Earl of Northumberland, whom accident had detained from the engagement, and whose power was still formidable, received pardon. Stung, however, by the loss of his son and brother, he, in company with Richard Scrope, Archbishop of York, and Thomas Mowbray, Earl Marshal, appeared, two years afterwards, again in arms. Ralph Neville, Earl of Westmoreland, who was allied, by marriage, to Henry, and was devoted to his cause, broke this combination by stratagem; took York and Mowbray prisoners on Shipton-Moor, and delivered them into his master's hands, at the castle of Pontefract, where, after a summary trial, they suffered death. Northumberland, accompanied by his faithful friend, Lord Bardolph, and bearing with him his young grandson, retired into Scotland. His estates were confiscated, and bestowed on different adherents of the King. Failing in an application for aid to the Scottish Court, and in their attempts to purchase it in Wales, France, and Flanders, through which they wandered together, these Noblemen came to the resolution of making a third effort to dethrone Bolingbroke, with no other means than those assured by their great personal influence and popularity in the North of England. Thither they accordingly returned, and were, soon after, both slain in the battle of Bramham-Moor. âSo that now,â says Holinshed, âthe prophesie was fulfilled which gaue an inkling of this heauie hap long before;âââFor this Earle was the stocke, and maine root of all that were left aliue called by the name of Persie, and of manie more by diuers slaughters despatched. For whose misfortune the People were not a little sorrie, making report of the gentleman's valiantnesse, renowne, and honour, and applieng unto him certeine lamentable verses out of Lucane,â &amp;c. Respecting his grandson, the same author remarks: âHenrie Persie, then but a child, sonne to the Lord Henrie Persie surnamed Hotspur, after his father's deceasse, that was slaine at Shrewesburie field, was conuied into Scotland, and there left by his Grandfather.â He was educated at the Court of the Regent, Robert Stuart, Duke of Albany; where he remained till about the date of the following scenes. The subject was suggested by the Ballad at the close of the second volume, which will serve to explain some allusions in the Drama. Boswell informs us, that its author, Thomas Percy, Bishop of Dromore, was the heir male of the ancient Earls of Northumberland. DRAMATIS PERSONÃ. Neville, Earl of Westmoreland and Northumberland.

Elinor alone. Enter Florence. Flor. She stood, majestic, 'mid her waving woods, Like Dian musing on her hill of cedars, Or that famed Princess, whom the grey-eyed dawn Found lingering on the beach beneath proud Carthage, Pensive and pale, her sandals wet with sea-foam, And her dark tresses with the tears of night, Accusing Heaven, and looking lorn as thou dost! El. Good morrow, cousin. Flor. Prithee, pretty maid, Why creep'st thou slyly from my side, at dawn, Day after day, up to this lonely platform? El. Look forth: let universal nature speak. See yonder, how the Cheviot summits glow; What fiery colors deck the glistening wood; How volumed, dense, and white, the river mist Winds down the gleaming vale! Flor. Solve me, sweet coz,â What stirs thy pensive breast to deeper musing Than all the hues and melodies of nature? Than moonlight walks on wild Northumbrian hills, Than hoarse waves booming to the ocean shore, Autumn's sear leaves, sad fields, and farewell song, Or converse with the starry spheres?âCome, solve me. El. Pish! leave such senseless rhapsody. Flor. A horn! A simple, merry, huntsman's horn!âHow sweet, From this high terrace to o'erlook the courts, When, mustering there, the leaders of the chase Marshal their bands, caparison their steeds, Vault to their seats, halloo, and, dashing out, Make hill and greenwood, high and low, Shrill to the merry bugle O! El. What mean'st thou, Florence? Flor. His vest was green, His feather blue, His glance was keen, His arrow true,â And hill and greenwood, high and low, Shrilled to his merry bugle O! El. In simpler words,âthe friend who knows me best, To whom my thoughts, even from our childish years, Have been transparent as the crystal waters, Believes me (else, why urge this tedious jest?) Enamoured of a hind, my father's vassal! Flor. O, spare me! frown not on my harmless muse. I did but sport: forgive me, Elinor. Yet, would I knew what preys upon your cheek, Shrouds you in gloom, and locks me from your bosom. When Raby's towers from morn till midnight rang With dance, masque, pageant, minstrelsy, and song, Our lives seemed sweetest pastime. Not a lark Rose from her nest more gayly to the skies Than we from slumber: joy was all our theme. Silence and melancholy now usurpâ El. What need to search my heart? Thou know'st it thine. Flor. Does Elinor unkindly cast me out From sympathy in sorrow, like a stranger? El. Cease, Florence, cease; I have not yet complained, Nor ever will, while bounteous Heaven showers down Blessings unnumbered on my worthless head. Complain! By what prerogative am I The darling offspring of a noble house? Born in this land of heroes? Graced in all things? Who gave those tender parents, and preserves? Who stretched a canopy above my bed, And steeps my eyelids in the dew of slumber, While many an one no worse than IâNo, no, If, spite of me, my thankless heart repine Because some fancied good swells not the store, Ne'er will I utter such rebellious murmurs. Flor. Seems it rebellion to thee, Elinor, To bathe the wounds which Providence inflicts In friendship's tears? El. As for that youthâfew words Will sum his story. Three months since, surprised By a wild night, while journeying near these walls, He begged a shelter. Voice, or face, or mien,â Fate willed it,âtouched my sire, who questioned him. Fortune, he said, smiled fairly at his birth; But fatal feuds, mischances long to tell, Robbed him of friends and substance while a child, And, ever since, his adverse fate had frowned. Cheered by kind looks and courtesy, he asked Among the hunting-train some humble post. Rare talents in the art so cherished here Had won him rank and favor, ere his arm, Blessed be Heaven, preserved my life and honor. Flor. Thy lifeâ El. Have I not told thee? Strange neglect!â O, Florence, hear.âA balmy eventide Allured me, with a damsel, down the vale. Beguiled with talk, and roving heedless, night O'ertook us. Hurrying through the wood, just where That ancient ash o'erspreads the way, a band Of prowling Scots, moss-troopers from the wild, Rushed from a covert, captive seized usâ Flor. Jesu! El. Bound us upon their horses, and amain Spurred for the Border. Long our dangerous course O'er hills and moors, by lonely robber paths, We held in darkness, guided by the stars And fitful lustre of the northern light. At last, (the moon now broad above the fells,) Crossing a glen, they halted in a brook, Full in the beam, to counsel, and to breathe Their o'erspent steeds. Four huntsmen, 'midst the parle, Reined up beside us. Judge what trembling seized me, When on their coats my father's crest I saw! Thinkâin that wild untrodden solitude To find brave Arthur by my side! Speech, breath Forsook me. Agnes shrieked. Then, Florence, thenâ But my brain reeled; his desperate charge I saw not. I found myself upon the moonlight bank Sustained by Agnes; felt upon my cheek The night-breeze freshened by the gushing rill Which Arthur from his basnet sprinkled o'er me. No hostile sound disturbed us; tranquil, pale, And sweet all seemed, till on the runnel's brink, Close at my feet, I spied two grim marauders Mixing their life-blood with the bubbling stream. That night he gave me to my mother's arms; And such a night!âsuch agonies of joy I hope no more to see.âTo this poor youth, Whose blood redeemed me, ingrate shall I prove? Flor. Forbid it gratitudeâ El. But if a lighter thoughtâremember, Florence, Mine is the stock of Lancaster, the blood Whose pure, proud current feeds the hearts of Princes. (Exit.) Flor. Four days!âand not a whisper of this tale,â That should have flown to meet me on the way, Leaped from her eyes, mixed with the welcome-kiss, And dwelt the favored theme upon her tongue! Her mother's silence, too!âay, that!âBut whyâ What doth he here? haunting about her steps, And practising upon her noble nature?â Alas! if Elinor,âthe gentle, high-souled,â This claims my care, and nicest observation. (Exit.) SCENE II. A court of the Castle.âEnter Westmoreland, meeting Arthur, with a falcon. West. How flies she, Arthur? Ar. Faithful to the lure, My lord, and bold upon the wing as eagles. West. Thank my Lord Marshal with the Tangier barb. See him caparisoned, and led by Hubert. What tidings from the North? Ar. Berwick is free. The Borderers stole away on Michael's eve. West. A raid of Murray's: so I wrote the King. Who brought the news? Ar. The Regent's courier passed, at dawn, For London. West. Spoke you with him? Ar. Yes, my lord. West. What brings he else? Ar. Nothing of any moment. Rothsay is dead, and Percy fled from court. West. Percy! Ar. The Hotspur's son. West. Fled!âWhither? Ar. Westward, Some say, with young Lord Douglas to the Isles; Though others think to France. West. Degenerate stripling!âFled!âHow long ago? Ar. Two months, my lord, he doth report, and more. West. If but a sparkâ(Pausing)âNo fear,âone night on straw Would send him with a quartan home to nurse. But this curled minion's father, long ago, Had shook my gates with Scotland at his back; Or, baffled there, like some grey Palmer knocked, With scrip, and scallop, craving charity, Harper, or Beadsman, muttering for the damned, And drenched our hospitable hearths with blood. Rough Hotspur, sooner than in exile languish, Ay, rather, if the spleen of fight were on, Unarmed would mount, and, with a frail ash spear, Tilt with the Fiend, than speak in courtesy. Ar. What thinks my lord? Were this fierce chief alive, Or any valiant scion of his stock, Would Henry, on submission at his throne, Restore their honors? West. Restore!âNorthumberland is mine: who takes Must win it. Percy lorded o'er the North Too proudly, and is sunk to rise no more. The Sire and the Son set Bolingbroke aloft, Meaning to rule the King they made; but soon Finding a check on their omnipotence, Their vengeful arms they turned; denounced his ruin; Drew half the kingdom to revolt, and clave, Almost, the diadem. Ar. Audacious traitors! West. Their fortune hit the planetary hour They, erring, thought, and sun and moon must bow, With humble adoration, to the Star Of their nativity. And, had not I Outwitted York, dispersed his power, and seized Mowbray and him, we now had drudged for bread, Cursing the pittance doled by Mortimer; While grey-beard Percy gored us with his rule, Counting each drop expiatory blood For Hotspur's death. Ar. And does my lord fear aught from Hotspur's son? West. The Piper? Lady Regent's toilet-man? Whose soul, in travail of a sonnet, faints, Seven times a day, entranced upon a lute? Alack! down-beds, perfumes, carpets, and ladies, He covets more than cold night-watches, sheathed In arms, steel pillows, and the smell of war. Ar. Strange tales of him the crones and Gypsies tell. Some say the noble babe was stolen by Fairies, Who left a changeling imp: some, that Night-hags Blasted the cradleâ West. Would the name were blasted, Rased and forgot! Rebellion 's in their ashes, And taints the air that blows upon my vassals. Fools cry, A miracle! when nature sports. 'T was thus when Edward's lion-mettled stock To Richard shrunk. The Scottish Regent strove To rear him up a scourge and thorn to me; Schooled him in every noble exercise, And sought the promise of his youth to prove, For, in his boyhood, sparks like Percy shone; But 't was a bootless toil.âLook to the steed. (Exit.) Ar. Buried in the dear ashes thou dishonorest, That spark, proud Westmoreland, thou 'lt find Alive for fatal mischief. Blest delusion! For once, thank Heaven, my better star prevails. (Exit.) ACT II. SCENE I. A high-wood walk in a park. The towers of the Castle seen over the trees. Enter Arthur. Ar. Here let me pause, and breathe awhile, and wipe These servile drops from off my burning brow. Amidst these venerable trees, the air Seems hallowed by the breath of other times.â Companions of my Fathers! ye have marked Their generations pass. Your giant arms Shadowed their youth, and proudly canopied Their silver hairs, when, ripe in years and glory, These walks they trod to meditate on Heaven. What warlike pageants have ye seen! what trains Of captives, and what heaps of spoil! what pomp, When the victorious Chief, war's tempest o'er, In Warkworth's bowers unbound his panoply! What floods of splendor, bursts of jocund din, Startled the slumbering tenants of these shades, When night awoke the tumult of the feast, The song of damsels, and the sweet-toned lyre! Then, princely Percy reigned amidst his halls, Champion, and Judge, and Father of the North. O, days of ancient grandeur! are ye gone? For ever gone? Do these same scenes behold His offspring here the hireling of a foe? O, that I knew my fate! that I could read The destiny which Heaven has marked for me! Enter a Forester. For. A benison upon thee, gentle huntsman! Whose towers are these that overlook the wood? Ar. Earl Westmoreland's. For. The Neville's towers I seek. By dreams I learn, and prophecies most strange, A noble youth lurks here, whose horoscope Declares him fated to amazing deeds. Ar. (starting back.) Douglas!â Doug. Now do I clasp thee, Percy; and I swear By my dear soul, and by the blood of Douglas, Linked to thy side through every chance, I go, Till here thou rulest, or death and night end all. Per. Amazement! Whence?âor how?â Doug. And didst thou think Thus to elude me? Per. Answer how thou found'st me. What miracle directed here thy steps? Doug. Where should I look for thee but in the post Where birth, fame, fortune, wrongs, and honor call thee? Returning from the Isles, I found thee gone. Awhile in doubt, each circumstance I weighed: Thy difficulties, wrongs, and daring spirit; The gay, delusive show so long maintained To lull observers; then set forth, resolved Never to enter more my native towers Till I had found, and searched thee to the soul. Per. Still must I wonder; for so dark a cloudâ Doug. O, deeper than thou think'st I 've read thy heart. A gilded insect to the world you seemed; The fashion's idol; person, pen, and lyre, The soft devoted darling of the Fair. By slow degrees I found Herculean nerve Hid in thy tuneful arm; that hunger, thirst, The sultry chase, the bleakest mountain-bed, The dark, rough winter torrent, were to thee But pastime; more were courted than repose. To others, your discourse still wild and vain, To me, when none else heard thee, seemed the voice Of heavenly oracles. Per. O, partial friendship. Doug. Yet had I never guessed your brooded purpose. Rememberest thou the Regent's Masque? the birthnight? Per. Well. Doug. That night you glittered through the crowded halls, Gay, and capricious as a sprite of air. Apollo rapt us when you touched the lyre; Cupid fanned odors from your purple wings; Or Mercury amused with magic wand, Mocking our senses with your feathered heel. In every fancy, shape, and hue you moved, The admiration, pity, theme of all.â One bed received us. Soon, your moaning voice Disturbed me. Dreaming heavily, you groaned, âO, Percy! Percy! Hotspur! O, my father! Upbraid me not! hide, hide those ghastly wounds! Usurper! Traitor! thou shalt feel me!â Per. No! Doug. 'T is true;âand more than I can now remember. Per. Yet never speak of it? Doug. Inly I burned; But honor, pride forbade. Pilfer from dreams! Thou knew'st the ear, arm, life of Douglas, thineâ Per. And long ago I had disclosed to thee My troubled bosom, but my enterprise So rife with peril seemed,âto hearts less touched, So hopeless! Knowing thy impetuous soul, How could I justify the deed to Heaven, How to thine aged sire? Armed proof I stand, To fate: come what will come, the wide earth bears No heart of kindred blood to mourn my fall. Doug. The heart of Douglas beats not with thy blood, But never will I trust in mercy more, In justice, truth, or heaven, if it forsake thee. Per. Douglas, thy friendship is my choicest treasure, Has been a radiant star on my dark way; And never did I doubt thy zeal to serve me. Lend, now, a patient ear.âWhile with my doom, Alone, I strive, no dread or doubt distracts me. No precious fate with mine involved, my heart Is fearless, firm my step. Exposing thee, The adamantine buckler falls, and leaves me, Naked and trembling, to a double death. Doug. Thou lovest me not. Per. Let Heaven be witness there!â The thought of bringing down thy father's hairs With sorrow to the grave, would weigh like guilt, Palsy my courage, cripple all my powers. Doug. So!âhave I wandered o'er the hills for this? Per. I would not grieve thee, Douglas, well thou know'st; But thus to hazard on a desperate cast Thy golden fortunesâ Doug. Cursed be the blood within me,â Plagues, and the grave o'ertake me, if I leave thee!â Though gulfs yawned under thee, and roaring seas Threatened to whelm thee! Per. For thy father's sakeâ Doug. Peace! I'd not go, if staying here would strew His hoar hairs in the tomb,ânot stir, by Heaven! Must I toss counters? sum the odds of life, When Honor points the way? When was the blood Of Douglas precious in a noble cause? Per. Nay, hear me, hear me, Douglas,â Doug. Talk to me Of dangers? Death and shame! Is not my race As high, as fearless, and as proud as thine? Per. I 've done. Doug. By Heaven, it shames me, Harry Percy, Preaching such craven arguments to me.â Now tell me how thou stand'st; thy cause how prospered. What has been done? What projects are afoot? Possess me quickly. Per. Gently; lest some busy ear Be near us. Little have I yet to tell thee. Thinking my rival's coat would best conceal me, I won his favor by a tale scarce feigned. Doug. A Keeper of his chase thy garb bespeaks. Per. Chief Huntsman. Thus disguised, I day by day Traverse my native hills, viewing the strength And features of the land; its holds of safety; And searching patriot spirits out. For, still, Though kings and gaudy courts remember not, Still, in the cottage, and the peasant's heart, The memory of my fathers lives. When there, The old, the good old day is cited, tears Roll down their reverend beards, and genuine love Glows in their praises of my sires. Doug. I long To press the sons, and tell them what a lord Lives yet to rule them. Per. When first I mixed among them, oft I struck, Unwittingly, a spark of this same fire. Encouraged thus, I sought its latent seeds; Seized opportunities to draw the chase Into the bosom of the hills, and spent Nights in their hospitable, happy cots. There, to high strains, I tuned the minstrel harp, Chanting the glories of the ancient day, When their brave fathers, scorning to be slaves, Rushed with their Chieftain to the battle-field, Trod his bold footsteps in the ranks of death, And shared his triumphs in the festal hall. Doug. That lulled them, as the north wind does the sea. Per. From man to man, and house to house, like fire, The kindling impulse flew; till every hind, Scarce conscious why, handles his targe and bow; Still talks of change; starts, if the banished name By chance he hears; and supplicates his Saint The true-born offspring may his banner rear, With speed, upon the hills. Doug. What lack we? Spread The warlike ensign. On the Border side Two hundred veteran spears await your summons. Per. What say'st thou! Doug. Sinews of the house: Ready to tread in every track of Douglas. By stealth I drew them in from distant points, And hid amidst a wood in Chevy-Chase. Per. O, Douglas! Douglas! even such a friend, For death or life, was thy great sire to mine! Doug. Straight, let us turn our trumpets to the hills; Declare aloud thy name, and wrongs; in swarms Call down the warlike tenantry, and teach Aspiring Neville fatal is the day The Percy and the Douglas league in arms. Per. If he were allâRemember haughty Henry, The nephew of his wife, Joan, Countess of Westmoreland, was half-sister to Henry IV. whose word could speed A veteran army to his kinsman's aid. Doug. Come one, come all; leave us to welcome them. Per. There lives a sad remembrancer for us.â Think of our fathers! Think of Shrewsbury! Doug. Hum! Per. Their cause was upright; all that hearts of flesh, And falchions tempered in an earthly wave, Could do, their valor wrought; yet Percy fell, And Douglas was a captive. Doug. Well; what then? Because fate baffled them, must we despair? Per. Ha! yonder's Elinor,âWestmoreland's daughter,â This lucky chance I wished.âDouglas, away.â Seek, by the river side, a Hermitage Carved in the rock. That half-worn path will guide thee. Doug. This way? Per. The left hand path. I'll come to thee anon. Donald shall be thy name. Mark,âmine is Arthur. (Exeunt.) SCENE II. A lawn before the gate. Enter Elinor, attended by a Damsel. El. As o'er the hills we flew, the very heavens Frowned wild and ominous; but when I woke, So melancholy sweet the moon looked on me, Murmurs so soothing stole upon mine ear, Awhile, I thought myself in some new being. Dams. Fairies keep revel on such nights, and oft About the traveller make woods and glades Seem full of voices, airs, and shrill, sweet pipingsâ El. But spake he, Agnes,âas thou saidst?â Dams. More like a lord, than a poor vassal, lady; Clasped you against his breast, and wept, and swore As he were frantic; nay, we thought you dead; Killed in the shock that slew the ruffian. Enter Percy. El. Ha! Agnes,â Per. Lady, a moment hear my suit. El. Your suit!âWhat suit? Per. A youth who loves, and, in his prosperous days, Favored me, wandering in a woodman's weeds, From home and kindred parted, craves a place, (Hearing my fortune in your father's service,) An humble place, among the train I lead. El. Receive him like a brother, Arthur; Welcome the wanderer to my father's house. But say,âwhat tidings from the Regent pass? I saw you from my tower, at peep of dawn, In parley with a Scottish courier. Per. No news. El. How fares my lady Albany? Per. Soft, benedicite! a tale there was. The Northern Muses weep, and wreath their harps With mournful willows; Lady Regent pines, Wan as a shade; court ladies droop, and sigh, Forsake their lutes, and talk of nunneries: Mirth, music, merry-making, melody, Speed the light hours no more at Holyrood:â The King of Glee, the gamesome Percy, 's fled. El. Has Percy fled? Per. So says the courier; none Knows whither. El. Gracious Heaven, protect his steps! Per. Ha! You speak with fervor, lady. El. While I rove These woods and walks, and wander through those halls Of lonely grandeur, every object wakes Some sad remembrance of the noble outcast. I entered, late, a long-neglected tower, Where, grey with cobwebs, torn, and soiled with dust, The ancient pictures of the race decay. There, dark-browed Hotspur, stooping to the charge, With many a famed, majestic Percy, moulders. A thrill of terror rooted me; they seemed to frown, And menace me with hostile eyes; Question my right in their domain; and ask, With looks of accusation, for their son. Per. How would their warlike fronts indignant burn, Could they behold the losel whom thou pitiest! El. Who knows, alas, but we have made him such? Have we not driven him from his native seats Out to the pitiless world, deprived of all That makes life dear? Who knows but he has rushed To pleasure's bowers for shelter from despair?â Ill-fated youth! the passions that have scathed, Had, haply, fired thee to immortal deeds, Shed lustre o'er thy country, decked thy brows With wreaths unfading as the amaranth. Per. Sure thou hast trod the gardens where it blooms, And learned compassion at the lips of Angels. El. I would not purchase greatness at this price, Would welcome, rather, some obscure retreat; Nor dream of splendor, save when Fancy spread Pavilions in the clouds, or tracked the moon, Or visited those mystic orbs of fire Spangling heaven's curtains, and beyond them heard The entrancing viols and unearthly voices, Sometimes to Saints made audible below,â Than reign the Queen of an adoring world, If I must do it in another's right. Per. Ah! would to Heaven such justice swayed all hearts. El. With but my sire's consent, how pleased would I Resign these sumptuous halls to their just lord; Seek Raby's bowers; and never, never more, Forsake the shades where, like a vision, flew My happy youth! the scenes of innocence, Of peace, and sunshine, where my joyous heart Chimed with the blithest music of the woodlands. No sorrow there, no secretâ(Stops abruptly.) Per. Sorrow! Dares she intrude into a Seraph's breast? Alas! art thou exposedâ El. Am I?âLook up, Presumptuous youth, and, if thou canst, regard The dazzling summit where the Neville shines. Do clouds of sorrow roll so high?âAgnes! (Exit.) Per. Vanished again!âWhat means this changeful mood? It grows upon her. Even when she seems Gentlest, and sweetest, breathing from her lipsâ Perpetual troubler of my thoughts! by Heaven, This fellow dogs me.âWell, how now? Enter Rook, as talking to himself. Rook. When Cats, and fawning Mongrels, be Exalted into Men's degree,â Captain! Per. How now, I say? Rook. Good morrow, noble captain! (Passes.) Then Wit and Reason must be grown Just fit to mouse, and gnaw a bone. (Exit.) Per. I must beware this knave:â He peers about me with a lynx's eye: Thrice has surprised me at unguarded moments. He turns,âI'll cross the brake and hie to Douglas. (Exit.) ACT III. SCENE I. A deep, shady solitude, before the Hermitage of Warkworth.âPercy and Douglas sitting on a stone bench by the door of the cell. Per. Caution must rein our ardor: see the land Drained for these wars; the King and Westmoreland O'er seas, with all the turbulent, bold spirits, Busy in France:âthen, stir for Mortimer, Make common cause with him, and we may thrive. Doug. With Mortimer? Per. My cousin Edmund's son, the lineal heir Of Clarence, lives: our rightful Sovereign. Doug. Where? Per. In London; whence I hourly look for tidings. But, if nought sinister by waves or war Befall the King, an absent pilot leaves The galley reeling. Men begin to murmur. This prodigal, say they, for selfish ends, Drags to unknown, inhospitable graves, Our sons; barters their bones for barren fame; Leaves us to starve, while he, on foreign shores, Plucks blood-stained laurels. Doug. Talk they thus? Per. Douglas, If Mortimer inherits but a soul, And once Northumberland will lift her voice, Oft, through the realm, in dark and troubled times, The watch-word of the mighty, hope survives For down-trod justice. Number but the host Of discontented spirits late fallen off; More, groaning yet beneath his father's stripes: And more that, from the first, pitying wronged Richard, Hated this proud usurping race, and fought In Percy's battles for the rightful heir: All, waiting but the call. Doug. If this be so, What fear? Per. And that were glory! grasp at once My own lost heritage, and throne my King! Sometimes the vision dances in my eyes, But ah! I fear, a glittering, empty bubble. Monmouth is wise, dauntless as Mars, and proved In all the issues of the field; he knows The talisman that rules a soldier's heart; Success has shed a blaze about his head, Dazzling to vulgar gazers: I, the while, Am but a stripling, yet unknown; my cause Unsanctioned by a name of power, save thine. Doug. But thou hast justice on thy side. Per. Alas! And had not Hotspur, too, when he lay stiffening? Douglas, I 've looked through men, and marked the ways Inscrutable, and dark, of Providence. Too oft the righteous is the luckless cause. Nay, have not holy men, in every ageâ Doug. Sweet lad, trouble not me with saintly lore. One thing I know, and, spite of flesh, will cleave to:â The justice of our cause can never hurt it. Per. Ha! 't is himself. Enter Bertram, attired like a Hermit. Bert. Heaven speed ye, sons! Per. (embracing him.) Nay, Bertram, thou behold'st a second self. This is that youthful Douglas, whose renown Has reached thine ears. Bert. Why then I see my brother of adoption, A true-born son of never-daunted Douglas. Doug. Approve him as you find him. Per. Long, and dark, And tragic, is the page of Bertram's story. Its emblems carved within this rock shall speak. Suffice it, Douglas, cruel fate, with wounds Incurable, had pierced his noble heart. Here, in this cell, I found him, where, in tears, Sackcloth, and bitter penance, Bothal's lord Had twenty winters mourned. He loved my sires, For whom his fathers and himself had fought; For Bertram, once, stood foremost of the brave. His faith and wisdom proved, my birth I told, Demanding counsel. Roused by Percy's name, The sorrowing Hermit woke, forsook his cell, Cast off the cherished burthen of his griefs, Serves me, and loves me with a zeal like thine. Doug. Thy hand. Brave Baron, I have heard thy fame, But thought thee mingled with the dead. Bert. The pangs Of many deaths may be endured. Per. Hark! (Horns heard in the forest.) What horns are those?âAnd horsemen? Doug. Lo! again. Per. Strike through the wood and see: lest I be sought.â (Exit Douglas.) Well, Bertram, speak. What speed? Bert. Alas, my lord, no hopes. Per. Ha, why? Bert. A high-born spirit so ignoble, So grov'ling, wedded to base things, lives not. Per. O Fate! Bert. He scarce is known at court: he soils His nobleness by fellowship with cullions: Spurns lore and chivalry, to waste his days In vulgar revels with the city scum. Per. O, Mortimer!âBut didst thou probe him, Bertram? Search to his heart? Show the foul wrong he suffers? Bert. I courted him; oft drew him into talk: Spoke of his father, grandsire, all his house Downward from Lionel; wept their fallen fortunes; Touched on his claim; the people's discontent; In my discourse, still, as by chance, let fall Words that had pierced, like scorpion stings, a breast Not seared to honor; but, a bond-slave, dolt, Or idiot, had been moved to nobler fire. Per. O, Nature! thou conspirest, too, With my cursed stars. Bert. He ne'er can serve our purpose. We need a young Prince rarely versed; who knows Men, and the times; apt, shrewd, and valiant; skilled To catch and fix the wavering multitude. But Mortimer, in noughtâ Per. A curse upon him! I would not stain the venerable chair Where Alfred shone, and godlike Edward sat 'Midst captive Kings; so oft by heroes filled, Whose wisdom, toil, and valor through the world Have spread our glory, made our narrow Isle Queen of the Sea, and Arbitress of Nations,â No,ânot for empire would I stain that throne With such a hilding. Henry's faults are princely, Such as in noble natures aptest grow, And ne'er will soil the robe not rightly his. Re-enter Douglas, hastily. Doug. Friends,âfriends,â Bert. What now? Doug. The King is coming. Per. What! Doug. True, as the faith,âthe English King,â This night, to Warkworth! Per. (with a start.) When? Doug. This very night, And with a slender train. Per. Immortal heaven! Doug. Infernal hell! if ever he depart Till Harry Percy hold his own. Per. To-night!â We cannot!âBertram!âDouglas!âGod of heaven! Had but a dayâbut one twelve hours of timeâ Doug. Hear, Percy! list! He hunts To-morrow; couches here to-morrow night; Next morning, goes;âif we, like coistrils, slaves, Base stirrup-lackeys, cap in hand, cry, Speed! Per. (smiting his breast.) 'T is come!â't is come! The issue of my fate!â Bert. Beware! refrain!âLord Douglas, answer me,â Were yonder horsemen couriers of the King? Doug. My lord, they were, and thus report. The King, Riding a course to Berwick, with a train Of twenty Nobles and an hundred Knights, Will reach this castle by the hour of curfew; To-morrow rouse a stag; and northward wend With next day's earliest sun. Per. That sun shall see Our banner in the wind, or me released From earthly thraldom!âThere 's a pathâa hopeâ A glorious path!âQuestion notâparley notâ Douglasâthose spearmen!âMount a fleet steed, Bertramâ This ringâ(producing a ring from his bosom.)âwas once my grandsire's signet; drawn From his dead hand on Bramham-Moor. For life, Hurry away to Mountfort. Thou wilt find him Clad like a minstrel, in an humble cot Fast by the towers of Fitzhugh. Say, the man Whose crest is on that ring has need of him. He will commune with Fitzhugh, and direct Your steps to Bardolph. Join me allâfail notâ Conjure them soâby twilight, in the cavern. Bert. Speaks Mountfort to his name? Per. Ask for old Harold, The harperâChildren know the ancient minstrel. Or, shouldst thou spy a giant-boned old man, Stooping his bulk upon a charging-staff, His locks and beard like hoar-frost, yet his brows Shaggy and black, 't is Mountfort. Now, to horse. Doug. Come on. Per. Would thou couldst meet these friends to-night. Doug. That will I, by the ghost of Merlin! Choose A clean-limbed steed, and lend me spurs. I need But strike the march; my kinsman Malcolm 's trusty. Per. Bertram, lead Douglas to the forest-gate: I'll follow with the coursers. (Exeunt.) SCENE II. A court before the stablÃ©s. Rook, alone. Rook. Some Juggler's brat, I'll swear, by Gypsies kidnapped, Knavish by nature, and in lies instructed, Left in a barn asleep, has slipped his masters, And come to practise his fine arts on us. Even if he be no worse.âHere comes my lord. Now, greensleeve, if thou 'rt not hag-born, beware me! Enter Westmoreland. West. Which way went Arthur? Rook. Toward the wood, my lord, With Shiek and Lady Bayard by the bit, Scarce cooled since yesterday. West. Whither? Rook. Heaven knows, Not I.âPerhaps, on Percy's service. West. Rook, If thou guard'st not that venomed tongueâ Rook. No doubt, no doubt, my lord, he serves you ably; Much better than a poor, plain vassal, bred In good old Westmoreland, of seed that 's known, And served your father well, and might, mayhap, Lead out a course as well as he. Nor spleen, Nor malice prompt me, my good lord, but love And true allegiance. Could your lordship list An odd adventure that befell me, late, Upon the hunt? West. If it concern me, speak. Rook. My lord, I sometimes ride upon the chase, An humble follower, like the rest, of Arthur. Not long ago, leading us up and down Under a burning sun the livelong day, He stopped at evening 'midst a group of huts Sequestered in the Cheviots. In a dingle, Divided from the rest some furlongs, stood Three lonely cabins: there, by strict command, The train was sheltered; but, for lack of room, My lord, my steed was stabled in a barn Planted amidst the thick of cottages. When I had slept, methought, an hour or twain, I woke; and as I mused, upon my straw, Chanced to remember somewhat left undone Most needful for my harassed beast. I rose; And drawing towards the green (the moon being bright) Round which the dwellings of the hamlet stood, Descried a press of peasants by a door. Stopping, I through the smoky lattice saw Within, encompassed by a gaping crowd, Our noble leader high in argument. West. Arthur? Rook. The same, my lord.âGreyheaded men, And boys, and all between, stock still, agape, Swallowed his words like tidings from the grave, While he, with gestures fierce, and eyes like beacons, Of Hotspur spoke. West. Of Hotspur! Rook. Ha!âhe comes!â Ever, my lord, he named himâ West. Peace! begone! When the stir 's past of this day and the next, I'll more of this. Begone! (Exit Rook.) How dare he touch That theme among my vassals?âHotspur! ha! Enter Percy. Per. Joy to my lord, and his illustrious dame, That conquering Henry draws so near to Warkworth. West. Thou 'rt well encountered.âBut a day he stays, And means to hunt, and I a course would hold Worthy my King. Look to it, knave. Be found In trim: with horses, hawks, hounds, harness, train, Glistering, and plumed for speed. Send Ivo out To warn the Cheviot warden. Per. Good my lord, Fear not.âWhat say ye to a Masque, my lord, After the chase, in honor of the King? West. A Masque? Per. After the banquet, with my lord's good leave, I know a little pageant that might draw Attention from your guests and Royal Kinsman. West. 'T would please me, sirrah. Per. Vizards, and hoods, and mail, are all we need. West. Open the armory. Per. And please, my gracious lord, That busy, meddling fools pry not about meâ West. Prate not. Begone unto your tasks. (Exit Percy.) That Rook regards him with a jaundiced eye, Hates, and would cast him, gladly, from my favor, Full well I know. There 's large allowance:âstill, To name amidst those peevish, factious slaves, The race they worship dearer than their God, Is treason. None that loved me e'er would do it.â Anon, I'll know the meaning of this tale. (Exit.) ACT IV. SCENE I. A cavern: a fire of embers burning on the ground. Percy standing in the cavern's mouth. Per. 'T is time they came.âThat broad and crimson cloud Which, just now, seemed a fretted vault of fire, Wave after wave, grows pale and gray:âthe rooks Are hush:âthe amber tint of twilight fades.â How oft have I, when fortune seemed afar, Gazed, musing, on that lingering streak of day, And wondered if, in all the shining realms Fancied beyond those hills, a bosom dwelt So desolate as mine! Or eyed yon star Kindle her cresset in the glowing West, And wished her placid bowers had been my birthplace! Now, my exulting heart would scarce exchange Her hopes for Paradise.âMichael to aid! Rid'st thou a hippogriff? Enter Douglas. Doug. Well, by the hum, Hurry, and stir abroad, our quarry's harboured? Per. Two hours ago. Doug. How strong? Per. Two hundred Knights, And twenty Nobles. Doug. Humph! one hundred Knights, The courier said. Per. No matter. Doug. Merrier sport; That 's all. Per. You found the soldiers safe? Doug. Impatient for my summons: dight like pilgrims, In separate bands, by ways obscure they come, To meet upon the outskirts of the wood.â Where 's Bertram? Per. Not yet come. Doug. Notâ Per. Hark!âI hear them. Doug. Whose deep-toned voice is that? Per. Old Mountfort's. Mark me, Douglasâhe alone, Knows me, or this day's chance: the rest expect But Percy's emissary. Name me not. Enter Bertram, Mountfort, Bardolph, Fitzhugh, and several Peasants. Thrice welcome, valiant Mountfort, to our cell! Lords Fitzhugh, Bardolph, and the rest, all welcome. Mount. Dark as a den of Cyclops! else my eyes Wax dim apace. Where art thou? Per. Here, my lord. Mount. Ay,âpress me,âmake me young again. My lords, This is the youth I spoke of. Per. Stir a blaze, That we may see each other's faces, Bertram. Doug. Most noble Mountfort, let me guide thy steps To yonder jutting rock. Mount. Who speaks? ha? Doug. (in a low tone.) Douglas. Mount. Guide me. Thy voice did thrill my pulses like a trumpet. (Whispering.) What! has he stooped? the Royal bird? Doug. Perched, my good lord. Mount. Good King! sweet King! shrive, shrive! I shall see day yet. (Douglas conducts Mountfort to a seat on the rock by the fire; which Bertram replenishes and fans to a blaze.) Per. (to the Peasants.) Draw near, my loving friends: stand not apart. Mount. Now then, explain the cause of this hot summons. Per. In part, my lords, you may have heard its purport? Bard. Touching our master's son, Lord Mountfort said, Young Percy. Per. Whom I serve: the hapless youth For whose illustrious Fathers yours have bled An idle sacrifice. For, where, alas! The pomp, power, victories, they dearly bought? The storied memory, my lords, is left In chronicles of other times, and serves, Serves but to wring an Exile's breast with anguish. In the cold tomb their wreath of glory lies: The Chieftain's arm protects no more: his voice, That should have cheered you in the fields of fame; In peace, ruled, shepherd-like, his flock, yet sleeps Mute and inglorious, in a land of strangers. My friendâhas a true heart;âdesires, And memory;âknows what his fathers were;â Like them aspires:âjudge how he feels his fate! All day, upon some sea-beat rock he sits, Mourning his people and himself as orphans, And begs, as Heaven's best boon, once to behold them. First Peas. (to the others.) Mark that! (Drawing near.) The Percy loves us, then? Second Peas. When saw you, Sir, our noble master? Mount. Peace!â No matter, now.âGo on.âPardon me, friends. Per. Your father, noble Bardolph, was the friend Of old Northumberland, and fared with him When, bowed with bitter years, the reckless Earl, Heart-broken by the loss of Hotspur, fled, Exposing to the time's vicissitudes, Insult, and want, and scorn, his hoary head, Rather than knee the murderers of his son. Through all his pilgrimage, thy noble sire Watched his sad steps, and cheered him from despair. At last, around his banners, from the North, Mustering a scanty train, he vowed to die, Or reave from Bolingbroke the blood-stained crown. On Bramham-Moor, Bardolph partook his fate.â Percy was yet a child; but having heard This tale, with every circumstance of love Shown to his grandsire by your noble father, Loves, even as his own, your name and race. Bard. Doth he?âHeaven judge me as I love him too! Per. Presuming on that love, he bade me speak.â In happier days, the name of Fitzhugh ranked High 'mid the valiant who for Percy drew.â But persecuted Mountfort, whose own eyes Witnessed the downfall of his master's house, Hunted, proscribed, an outlaw for his faith And zeal untamable in Percy's cause, Would spring, we knew, to vengeance. Mount. By the gods, Though fourscore stiffening winters gripe my limbs, And dim these eyeballs, with a cripple's crutch I'd beard the tyrant! Bard. Persuasion it needs not to stir my heart. Much have I wished me near the noble youth; Daily and nightly I implore my Saint To keep and counsel him. But for our babes, I had not now been here,âhad long ago Wedded my own to his abandoned fortunes. Say to my exiled Chieftain, Bardolph holds Life but for him, and will his summons answer As his dear father's voice spake from the ground. Mount. St. George and victory! the day is won. Per. The Percy shall requite thee, Bardolph. Mount. Now, What says my son-in-law? what says Hugh Fitzhugh? Fitz. Commend me to the youth, and wish him well. Mount. Wish him!âBut barren wishes, son? Fitz. Nor more, Nor less, Sir. Mount. (stepping back.) Fiends! is this your answer? Fitz. Yes, rash man. Mount. Hell sear thy tongue, then, runagate, When thou claimest kindred next with Marmaduke! By all my wrongs I swear to starve, rot, kneel To Lancaster,âto Neville kneel,âere owe Shelter or succour to a recreant more. Doug. And so would I, by Jupiter!âAvaunt! Fitz. Stand off, young Brave! I'll teach you, else, to tremble! Doug. Teach Douglasâ Per. Douglas! Mountfort! Peace, for Heaven's sake! Doug. (grasping Fitzhugh.) Learn first, thou cravenâ Per. Hold! (Thrusts Douglas to the wall.) What! are we ruffians? A den of bandits?âStir not, on thy life!â Why, Mountfort, thou art rash as madness.â Brave Fitzhugh, turn notâShame! shame! outrage! Turn not, indignantâFie, my lord, O fie! (To Mountfort.) To mock your own white head! Mount. Look ye, (takes off his cap) my nonpareil! my valiant wisher! Here stands the noble Percy: this is he. Wish for thyself! Beseech ye, wish!âWhat! dumb? Per. Be dumb thyself, or by my father's soul, Age, name, and love, shall vanish on the word! Peasants. (who had crowded round Percy.) Art thou, indeed, our Chief? Is Arthur, Percy? Per. The same, my friendsâThanks, for your steadfast love. First Peas. Kneel, ye unmannered boors.â Dear, honored, noble master, may a poor Unworthy vassal kiss thy hand? Second Peas. And I? Third Peas. And I? Fourth Peas. And I? Per. Remember, I have proved, And love you all.âStands Bardolph yet aloof? Bard. O Percy! Percy!âIf this form be he Clasped in my arms, what more can Heaven bestow? Mount. Be he? Look, Bardolph! look! Be he, forsooth! Whose kingly front? whose falcon eye is that? Per. Come, Baron Fitzhugh, to my heart. Thy wish, Thy friendly wish, I prize. Forget, my lord, The hasty words of your impetuous father, Who from aspersion would your honor guard At his life's hazard.âHere, a comrade stands, Whose hot pulse travels at a pace with Mountfort's: Archibald Douglas, son to Scotland's earl. Doug. (wringing Bardolph's hand.) Lord Bardolph, thine till death; and thine, old Chief. Bard. Thanks, noble Douglas!âBut methinks I dream. Per. Long had I languished for my native land; Burned from my father's battlements to rend The hostile crest, and vindicate their fame; Oft, round my bed their restless spirits stalked, With looks indignant, pointing to their tombs By foemen trampled. Plighting Heaven an oath To rescue them, or be myself their tenant, I hither came, to see what friends, what hopes, Survived our fortunes. Hid beneath this vest, With eyes observant I 've explored the land, Tyring the temper of our ancient vassals, And find our house, beyond my utmost hope, Loved and remembered. Neville's yoke they loathe. The sun-burned ancient darkens at his name, Deep vengeance threatening when his injured lord From Scottish hills descends to claim his birthright. With blessings, prayers, and vows, am I invoked As their deliverer. Mount. The meanest hind Chained to the soil, would welcome death for Percy. Per. Fired by such zeal, I had a scheme devised Would task their valor, had not happy chance Opened a surer path to all my wishes.â With you it rests to terminate our woes, Chase these disastrous clouds, and give again Our planet to her lustre. Fate has cast Even at my feet my princely heritage. Bard. What means my lord? Mount. 'T is true as Heaven! one grasp Reclaims Northumberland. Fitz. (aside.) Madness? Bard. If there be hope in arms, and Bardolph faint, Let âCowardâ be his epitaph. Per. How beats Lord Fitzhugh's heart? Fitz. In tune with Bardolph's. But, with blindfold eyes, To seal conspiracy, pass desperate pledge With a mere stranger, sooth to say, whose name Bore not its old repute, whose fortunes seemed Given o'er to ruin, had not less been frenzy Than risk, for nought, my life on raging seas, Or, for the fallen, leap a precipice. My heart was with you, Sir,âmy sword shall be, When reason's semblance guides the enterprise. But, noble Percy, humbly let me ask, What can two thousand vassals, toil-worn hinds, To counsel, camps, and arms unused, against The might of Neville, backed by England's King? Per. Your words seem wise, and show considerate thoughts. Now lend, my friends, a heedful ear. Mount. Draw nearer. Per. King Henry is in yonder castle. Fitz. Sir! Per. The King:âthis night arrived:âslightly attended. Bard. Ha! Mount. What think ye now?âThe tyrant, Bardolph! Here! Come like a victim to the sacrifice! Per. All that my restless heart has panted for; Clung to, despairing, as affection clasps The breathless clay; which might have wasted life In hopeless chase, and left me, if my youth 'Scaped sword and dungeon, but an exile's grave, Relenting Heaven, in pity offers me. Yourselves shall judge.âIn honor of the King, The Earl, to-morrow, holds a mighty hunt, And grants me leave, at night, to show a Masque. Arms, and the keys, to that intent, are mine. My lords, this cavern, seemingly barred up By yonder rocks, issues beneath the castle; Commanding by a range of vaults, unknown To its new lord, the hall and posterns; scooped For special purpose in my grandsire's wars. Through this, what power we please, may be conveyed Into the walls; environ them without, And every gate, ward, avenue, is ours, Even to the hall of state, where, high in pomp, The King and nobles feast. The castle won, Whose voice will dictate?âWill they for their lives Cavil on nice conditions? call my lands A hard exaction as a Monarch's ransom? Mount. Will they gainsay our daggers? Fitz. Troth, my lord, What looked as to attempt the mid-day sun, Appears an easy triumph. Per. Can we fail?â The train will then be weary, flown with wine, Unarmed, and unsuspecting. Bard. Death, or life, I'll stake upon the cast! Doug. O, noble Bardolph! Mount. Speak, Fitzhugh, speak! Fitz. And I. Per. Then briefly, Sirs, how many trusty spears Can ye lead up to-morrow night by curfew? Bard. (after a pause.) My lord, five hundred. Per. What says gallant Fitzhugh? Fitz. (with hesitation.) Three hundred spears, and crossbows, were the utmost. Mount. (aside to Fitzhugh.) Five hundred, son, five hundred say: match him. Fitz. Impossible, my lord! On one day's notice? Mount. Call in the Devil!âPercy, I do pledge Five hundred for my son and self: I'm known To some brave hearts; I boast a little power; I'll eke it, by my soul! Per. And bind me ever. Bert. My lordâ(Draws Percy aside.) Doug. Old bird of flame, Thou must fly north, and snuff our mountain air, And soar with strong-winged Douglas. Mount. Mass, and will, Young goshawk: score with Monmouth first. Per. My lords, let all come singly to this forest. Come not in bands; the hunt will be abroad Through all the Border. Charge, with strictest heed, Each soldier,âmark me, Sirs,âto wear a bugle. (To the Peasants.) Friends, you possess my bosom thoughts. Demean Yourselves like men. Assist your worthy lords In calling in their vassals,âmates of trust: Next week, perchance, the grandsire on his crutch, Your wives and little ones, with garlands crowned, Will join the feast at Percy's jubilee. First Peas. Let that day come, We care not if our requiem 's next. Per. Now, gentle friends, farewell! Heaven be our shield! Good night, brave-hearted Mountfort! Like an oak By ages buffeted, thy hoary top Still scorns the tempest. Mount. Time rolls backward, Percy!â This joyful night, as in a wizard's glass, Shows me myself when these white locks were raven, These withered sinews like the Danite's nerve, And hope rekindles me. Bard. My lord, farewell. Per. Bardolph and Fitzhugh, both farewell. Fail not. Fitz. No fear. Peasants. Good night, brave Percy. Per. Guard ye Heaven! (Exeunt.) SCENE II. A bedchamber. A lamp burning. Armour lying on the table and floor. Percy walking up and down the room. Per. O! for those vanished hours so much misprized!â Strange! when the music of her tongue I heard, Gazed on her face, basked in her smiles, my soul Could pine for other good!âFrom some dim world, I may look back with anguish to the days When here, with her, in my paternal shades I dwelt, and wish my heart had known her rest.â I may have ta'en my last adieu.âWho knows?â To leave her thus!âbelieving me a churl Incapable of any touchâ(Pauses, listening.)âWhat strain?â (Approaches the lattice.) A light yet burning in her tower!âYe Saints!â Her voice and harp!âpast midnightâHa! could I notâ That same was once my mother's oratoryâ I know the secret entrance.âPower of love!â (After a moment's irresolution, snatches the lamp, and exit.) SCENE III. An oratory opening into Elinor's chamber. A missal spread upon the altar, before a crucifix: over it a large picture of the Virgin. Elinor kneeling, and singing to her harp. El. O, holy Virgin, call thy child, Her spirit longs to be with thee; For threatening lower those skies so mild, Whose faithless day-star dawned for me. From tears released to speedy rest, From youthful dreams which all beguiled, To quiet slumber on thy breast, O, holy Virgin, call thy child. Joy from my darkling soul is fled, And haggard phantoms haunt me wild; Despair assails, and Hope is dead: O, holy Virgin, call thy child. (As the sound of her harp ceases, the picture slides, discovering Percy, wrapped in a cloak, with a lamp. She starts.) Grace keep us! Per. Fear not, lady; angel guardians Surround by night the bower of Innocence. (Springs down.) El. What apparition?â Per. (throwing off his cloak.) Pardon, gentle lady! Bold as may seemâ El. Ha! do I wake?âWhat dost thou here, audacious? At midnight!âHence, rash youth! with speed, begone! Hence! or I wake the house. How darest thou, slave, Steal on the secrets of my worship?âFly! Thy very life may answer such an outrage. Per. Sweet lady, hear me. El. Quit this place. Per. One wordâ El. Heavens! is the Neville's daughter so abased That grooms dispute her chamber?âHo! Per. Nay thenâ But, by my soul's eternal hope, I swear In gratitude, in honor, but to say Farewell, I came. El. How? Per. No matter:âwhen we meet again,âabove, Thou 'lt better know me. God be with you, lady. (Takes his lamp, going.) El. Nay, now, I know not what thou meanest. Per. Sweet saint, I would have told thee. El. Goest thou from our service? Per. Thus to interpret!âSooner would I dare Insult a glowing Cherub, perish in his glance, Than sully, but in thought, thy purity. El. If I have done injusticeâ Per. Speak; I pause. El. What canst thou have to say? Per. Thanks, thanks unnumbered, Blessings unspeakable for all thy favors. Shrined here,âwhile life beats,âworshipped, they will dwell, Although thy beauty I behold no more. El. No more! Per. My heart is full,âyet scarceâ Thou know'st, when I became an inmate here, I called myself an orphan; desolate; In the wide earth alone. So far, thou heard'st A mournful truth; yet I deceived you. El. Ha! Deceived us, Arthur? Per. Arthur 's not my name: Nor am I what I seem. El. Shield us! Who art thou? Per. Though in your halls a vassal, Arthur boasts Blood older than these towers, or any oak Leafless with age on yonder hoary hills. Thou seest me fallen; but my Fathers stood Their country's bulwark. Kings have quaked to hear The rumors of their march: their rushing host This sea-throned Isle has to her centre shook. El. What next, I prithee? Per. Alas! What shall I say then? What will vouch my truth?â Durst I my name revealâ El. O, Sir, forbear: A name so potent might unseat our towers. Per. Hast thou, before, found cause my faith to question? Ever, before this night?âIn justiceâ El. No. Per. Believest thou, in this solemn parting hour, Lips that dare imprecate Heaven's wrath on falsehood, Avenging thunders, hell, and penal judgment, My lips,âcan frame a lie? Believest thou this? El. I would notâcannot think it; but this taleâ Per. A moment, lady, counsel with your heart.â Have you not something seen, or fancied, in me, That seemed ill coupled with this outward baseness? Arguing a mind above the hireling's pitch, A nobler nature,âas in some mewed eagle That creeps, degraded, round a peasant's croft, Proving the native of the princely eyry? El. Suppose I have. Per. Recall the time When first thou saw'st my face;âthe tale I told. Glance back to many a trivial circumstance That still belied me; startled thee, so oft, And made thee gaze with wildered eyes. O, think, Think of that night when righteous Providence Rescued your honor:âwhen the moon beheld Your deathlike face, and loose locks on my breast;â When my roused spirit spoke,âall else forgot,â High as her bent, and tender as the hour! Thou own'st, feel'st truth in this. Mark! do I, now, Fashion my speech in phrase of servitude? Would the carle's tuneless tongue prove false the boast That courts have been my home; my walk with princes; My toil the Antique Sages' lore; my sport, Penning the roundelay for ladies' lyres, Who paid me with the radiance of their eyes? El. Pray leave me. Per. One brief moment ere we part.â I goâI goâwhere Destiny conducts me:â To be myself;âor cast disguise, and life, Together, off. In rank thine equal, peer To England's proudest, powerful as thy sire, And crowned with old hereditary laurels, Arthur returns, or never more. Ah! say, If Fate should smile,âwilt thou smile too?âcanst thou, O, canst thou bid me riseâto life, to love, To paradise with thee? El. My heart,âI mean,â I'm giddy: all my senses seem bewildered. Per. Ah! may I construe silence?âTongues More used to ecstasy might talk of mine! El. But whither goest thou?âon what quest? Per. I cannot answer thee. El. But is there danger? Per. Question me not, for chains are on my tongue. El. O! choose some more propitious season. Per. No; One mystic hour the characters of fate Mark for the enterprise, that must not pass me. El. What dreadful meaning lurks beneath your words? I fearâI fearâ Per. For Arthur? El. Methinks I dream; so strange, so wildering seems This tale. When ends the mystery? saidst thou when? Per. My fortunes touch upon a speedy issue. Nor had thy sympathy been vainly waked, Could I have torn my trembling heart away, That clung and would not leave thee,âleave thee here, Unconscious of my love,âa rival's prize,â Never to be remembered more; or deemed Senseless of virtues dearer to my soul Than breath can utter. Falling, I could now Greet death with smiles: the rapturous thought thou know'st My heart's dear hope, and wilt remember me, Brightens the dark hour like a glimpse of Eden.â Farewell!âthe matin star grows dim.âO, heed! If this be not a dream of ecstasy, A moment comes, is now upon the wing, When, unexpected, I may rise to claimâ To sueâAh! then shrink not to confess me!â (Presses her hand hastily to his lips; ascends. The picture closes after him.) El. (in a wild tone.) He 's gone!âto bleed! to perish!âWoe is me! What will become of meâ Enter Florence, from the bedchamber, in her night mantle, and clasps Elinor in her arms. Flor. Nay, start not, love; Waked by your voices, breathless I o'erheard Your wondrous interview. Sure he is noble, And merits worth like thine. El. (hiding her face in Florence's bosom.) But he is gone!â O Florence, Florence!âgone for ever,âO! That he should perish,âjust upon the verge Of all his hopes! Flor. Not so;âhe spake not so despairing. Hope, Methought, gave lively courage to his accents. El. O, dost thou thinkâ(Stops abruptly.) Flor. Indeed I do,âI'm sure His voice, his face, his mien, his modesty, His valor, every graceful word and act Proclaim him noble. El. Ah! whoe'er he be, In such an issue,âhad he asked it of me,â I would have strengthened him from Neville's power. Now, friendless, he is gone, and never more Shall I behold him. Flor. Dear Elinor, you will,â But hark!âhark! as I live, the morning cock! Come in;âcome,âon our pillows we will talk it. El. First let me pray. Flor. Not now:âto-morrow. El. Oh! I hear sweet sounds. Flor. Nay, nay,ârepose is needful. (Leads her in.) ACT V. SCENE I. The cavern: discovering in rear a long arched passage, filled with armed men, disguised as foresters, friars, &amp;c. Mountfort, Bertram, and Bardolph, in armour, with torches in their hands, marshalling the throng. They at last come forward. Mount. A goodly brotherhood, friend Bertram! I ne'er saw better faces cowled: I spy Devotion in them. Bard. Douglas! cap-Ã -pie! Enter Douglas. Doug. Now, by my hand, old Mountfort, that white beard Becomes a breastplate. Bert. Say, where tarries Percy? Doug. Yet in the hall. Mount. How goes the revel? Doug. High: They feast like gods: the Norman beakers clang, And foam, as for another kingdom won. Harps, horns, recorders, timbrels, trumpets, drums, Swell like the sea-stave: turret, keep, and tower Return a groan like ordnance from the hills. Mount. Roar! roar! till wassail from the gates send forth A voice like Babylon! But, sterner sounds Those towers may echo ere the dawn of day. Bert. All things seemed hush without the walls? Doug. As death. I met no living thing, nor heard a sound. Enter a Sentinel. Sent. My lords, two stag-hounds just now crossed my watch. Bert. Ha! stragglers of the chase are out. Stand close. Doug. Hush! (Springs to the mouth of the cavern.) Bard. What 's there? Bert. Hold, Sirs; keep in. Mount. What saw he? Doug. (dragging in Rook.) Confront the light.âHey! Chevalier of Steeds!â Comest thou to taste my whip again? Mount. Sirrah, What brought thee here? Rook. Sirrah! my legs. Mount. Snap'st, dog? Look that they bear thee stiffly then. (Strikes him.) Rook. Dotard, I'll pluck thy beard! I know thee. Mount. Dost thou, owl? Then this,âand this,âfor old acquaintance' sake. (Beats him with his gauntlet.) Enter Second Sentinel. Second Sent. Voices are in the wood, my lords, that draw Apace this way. Doug. Death! (Unsheaths his sword in alarm.) Bert. Quick! shroud those torches. Bard. Now villain, speak not, as thou lovest thy life. Mount. (Snatching out his dagger, and half throttling Rook.) Stand where thou art,âdumb,âmotionless,âor else By God, and by the Sangreal, this throat Never gasps more! (Voices heard without; and the trampling of horses passing by. The sounds grow fainter; and, by degrees, die away. After an interval of silence, Bertram and Douglas cautiously approach the cavern's mouth.) Bard. Our hold is safe. Mount. What! Douglas,âup the wind? (Bardolph and Mountfort follow the other two; and all stand listening. Rook steals, unperceived, behind a dark angle of the wall.) Bert. That shrillest voice was Neville's page. Doug. Their course Is toward the castle. Yet I hear the hoof-tramp. Bert. Benighted huntsmen, not a doubt. Doug. Great Jove! They must have passed within a lance's length. Mount. Hark! A shout.â Bert. Their salutation at the gate: And now athwart the barbacan they clatter. Doug. (turning.) Ha! where 's that villain? Bert. Heavens! Mount. Incarnate fiend! One instant since he stood behind me. Doug. Watch thereâ He could not pass,âhe lurks in some dark nookâ (Rook darts from the cavern.) Mount. (clapping his hands.) Escaped, by Heaven! Bert. And Percy 's lost! (Douglas snatches a cross-bow from one of the Sentinels and rushes out, followed by Bardolph.) Mount. My life upon that bolt!â Now Douglas!âBardolph!ânow like greyhounds strain! Bert. We 're lost,â't is dark,âhe cannot,âall is lost! Mount. (striding up and down, greatly agitated.) Who says we 're lost?âO, Douglas! now outstrip Your mountain whirlwinds,âLost, my lord?âNoânoâ (Aside, in a sudden and eager whisper.) But ifâwere 't best? Ha?âswoop upon them, ere He warn them? Bert. What? Mount. Peace! Hark!âHe cannot 'scape!â Twang, noble Scot!âO, wet the feather, Douglas!â First Sent. My lords, they come. Re-enter Douglas and Bardolph bearing in Rook, wounded with an arrow. Mount. Lo!âLo!âI knew it!âHeaven! I saw!âCould Douglas fail in such a cast? Bert. O, Douglas, thou hast saved us! twice hast saved us! Doug. What mean these chances, friends, that tread so fast On one another's heels? Bert. Omens, I fear, Of fatal augury. Mount. Of victory!âof vengeance!â Doth not the blood of yonder miscreantâ Enter Percy. Doug. Tush! Help him aside.âHow speeds it in the hall? Per. As yet, our fortune shines in the ascendant. Henry is high in glee; Neville well pleased; His haughty Lady smiles, and sends such cups Of potent Rhenish round as Mars would reel with.â Are all the forces here? Bard. All come, all harboured. Per. Well: the hour draws nigh. Where 's Fitzhugh? Mount. Sick, Sick, Percy! taken last night grievously! O, look not in my face.âFive hundred spears Came at my heels. Per. (pressing his hand.) Heroic Chief! What cause Couldst thou not animate!âThe order, friends, You fully know. Lord Mountfort will control This post, the vaults, and subterranean passes? Bardolph invest the walls; Bertram defend The armory. My side the Douglas guards. Grave on your hearts the iterated charge, No sword be sheathless, nor an arrow poised, Till I command. Who stirs ere that for blood, Is Percy's foe. The King will quickly rise: Then comes the Masque; and when the castle bell Strikes, to your posts. To questions, answer, Masquers. (To Douglas.) A word with thee. (They retire down the cavern.) Bert. O, that the die were cast! Bard. You seem much downcast, Bertram. Bert. I have seen times Ere now, when darkness black as Erebus Shut in my soul, and this world seemed a lair For beasts to howl in; but, as grace I hope, I never keener anguish felt than now: Scarce, when I plucked my blasting dagger forth, And found it reeking with a brother's blood.â Like one commissioned from the skies to heal me, He came, a ministering Angel, to my cell. Wisdom, and peace, as honey, from his lips, Assuaging fell. He reasoned, comforted, Convinced meâOh! you know not half his worth, Not half the beauties of his generous heart. Now, should he fall,âshould savage Henry crop This flower of natureâ Mount. Tut, no fear of that. Bert. How bore the King, Sir, when devouring hosts Tumbled, like billows, round him; birds of death Screaming above his head?âAt evening's close, His bandogs gorged the flesh of Princes; Knights, And Nobles lay, as blasted locusts heap The desert sands. Will he tamely submit? He slur the brightness of his vaunted glory By lightly yielding to our threats? Mount. Wait till we ask it!âFight it to the death! The boon we crave!âForbid it, Vengeance! Yield? First let him taste us; grapple once with men, Not dainty sucklings of the milk of France. Bert. Your passion leads astray. Suppose him slain: Where are we then? Mount. Where are we? Lords of England. Bert. Would Bedford, Clarence, Glo'ster, bow to that? Mount. Think'st thou we wait their leave? Bert. Your scope, my lord, I know not. If at civil bloodshedâ Mount. Nay, love not that; though I should like to pay Some rubs and knocks that I and others took Of upstarts. Percy and Douglas return. Per. Nothing, my friends, have I to add. To say,âBe resolute; be cool;âwere breath Spent idly, Mark! the bell. Adieu! Mount. Percy and Esperance! Sound, trumpets! Charge For old Northumberland! Bert. Farewell! farewell! Per. Cheer up, kind Bertram: faint not at the door. Remember Percy's mottoâ Mount. (in a low voice to Douglas.) Haggard, Look to the stag of ten! Per. No further talk: now to your several charges. (Exeunt Percy and Douglas: the rest move down the cavern.) SCENE II. The Castle hall. Lady Westmoreland, Elinor, and Florence, seated under a canopy: King Henry, and Nobles, in their hunting dresses, gathered round them in conversation: the Royal retinue, and retainers of the Castle, scattered in groups about the hall, while the tables are drawn. K. Hen. I flatter not. Now, what says noble Warwick? War. As much, my liege: the hunt was bravely pushed. K. Hen. Ay, by my knighthood, thrice upon the course I thought to ask what mettled gallant led it. War. I cannot say, my liege: an active huntsman. K. Hen. Lady! good Aunt! Or, Cousin, thou canst tell.â What stripling Centaur leads your father's hunt? El. My liege,âIâknow notâ K. Hen. Blush not, pretty playfere: I broke not truce. Those timorous ears are pricked At every fancy. Flor. Simple girl!â His name is Arthur, gracious liege. K. Hen. Well, mistress, What more? what parentage? whence and who is he? Lady West. (turning quickly.) A beggar-boy, we took for charity. War. Here comes my brother. K. Hen. Uncle Westmoreland, What daring youth led forth the train to-day? West. You task me, liege, above my knowledge. K. Hen. Patience! West. Which simply ends in this, his name is Arthur. Three months ago, I found him, coarsely clad, Driven in one blustering night to 'scape a storm. Silent he seemed, and sad of heart; yet spake With such mild grace, the less he said, the more Curious I grew to hear. His friends were dead; (For, once, he said, he had them kind, and able;) His patrimony lost; and he an exile. Won by a gentle word or two, he begged, Having no home, a place among my huntsmen: A boon right gladly granted; since repaid By deeds of nearest service to our house. K. Hen. He has endowments: you should cherish him. Such feats of horsemanship I scarce have seen. West. Liege, every free and high-born courtly grace Prized by the noblest nursed in Princes' halls, Learning, arms, courtesy, and wit, appear Native in him as doth his horsemanship. K. Hen. Why, Uncle, these are marvels. Call him in. West. He plainly shuns the light; but I have worn An eye of note upon him, and, of late, Begin to think him far above his seeming. K. Hen. Cite him. How long his service here? (A flourish of music.) Seneschal. (loudly, from the lower part of the hall.) The Masque! West. First, view a little entertainment, liege, Devised and led by him. Seneschal. Lords, clear the hall. West. My lords, and gentlemen, please you be seated. (The crowd retires, leaving the area of the hall vacant.) (A shrill fanfare from the minstrels ushers in a phalanx of Spearmen. They approach, in close array, the group round Lady Westmoreland and the King; halt, and open into a crescent, discovering in the midst Percy and Douglas in splendid armour. An ivory horn suspended by Percy's side, and the armorial bearings of his house blazoned on his shield. He lifts his beaver, advances, and speaks.) Per. To show our humble pageant, dreaded Liege, Fair Ladies, Peers, and Knights, behold us come.â Fearful a tale artless and rude as ours May prove, from lips unskilled in buskined pomp, But wearisome to Courtiers; yet, kind Sirs, We'll show you warriors' pastime, when the King, Girt with his Barons, rises. Rise ye must; All,âKnight and Noble,âto a doubtful game! For honor, life, we play, and mean, my lords, To quit us valiantly. West. (aside.) Why, who are these? Per. I cannot practise, for your sport, the Antic. Too long, too long a Masquer, Arthur comes, Stripped of disguise, this night, to execute His fathers' testament;âwhose blood lies spilt; Whose murmurs from the tomb are in his ears; Whose injuries are treasured in a scroll Steeped with a mother's and an orphan's tears. O'er that dark record has my spirit groaned, Since dawning reason, in unuttered anguish. When others danced, struck the glad wire, or caught The thrilling murmurs of loved lips, I roamed Where the hill-foxes howl, and eagles cry, Brooding o'er wrongs that haunted me for vengeance. K. Hen. What tune may this be, Uncle? West. Faith, my lordâ Per. For I have been an outcast from my cradle; Poor, and in exile, while an alien called My birthright, home. Halls founded by my sires Have blazed and rudely rung with stranger triumphs; Their honorable name rivals have stained; Trampled their laurels and profaned their bones; Hence have I labored; watched while others slept; Known not the spring of life, nor ever plucked One vernal blossom in the day of youth. The harvest of my toils, this night, I reap; For death, this night, or better life awaits me. Before my lord the King I stand, and claim Northumberland, my just inheritance, As Henry Percy, son and heir of Hotspur. (All start.) West. Percy!âHotspur!â K. Hen. (to Westmoreland.) What say'st thou now? West. Impossible! impossible! great Heaven! It cannot be. Lady West. 'T is but in sport, my lords, 'T is but the play. West. What means this, boy?âBut sport?â Speak, or by Heavenâ Per. Peruse yon steely circle.â Do those dark faces seem familiar? West. Ha! Per. Those are the warriors of the Bloody Heart, And this the son of Douglas. West. (starting back.) Douglas!âNo; This cannot be. Doug. (raising his beaver sternly.) Look! West. What! ho! to arms! Treason! to arms! Knights. (in different parts of the hall.) Arms!âHark you?âSirs, they cry to arms. Seneschal. (hastily approaching.) What means that shout? West. (loudly.) Treason! to arms! Ho! Treason! (A confused multitude of voices repeat the cry, and knights rush to the door, but are driven in. Percy and Douglas, meanwhile, lean in silence on their swords. The pibroch is sounded.) Seneschal. (returning.) The pass is guarded. West. (to King Henry.) Follow me. (Hurries to a postern near the seat of Lady Westmoreland, which he throws open.) Descend, my liege. Voices within. Stand back! Ho! Esperance! K. Hen. Ha! hold, my lord. West. O, treachery! O, villain! (An armed man appears upon the steps of the passage, and closes the postern.) Per. Thou find'st us provident. West. Accursed traitor! (Rushes at Percy with his dagger, but meets the levelled lances of the spearmen.) Per. Tempt not your fate.âBeware, Lord Westmoreland! West. Slave! hypocrite! (Striking his head.) Fool! fool! most blind. K. Hen. Cousin of Westmoreland, stand here awhile. (Advances a few steps; waves his hand to silence the tumult; when all is hushed, speaks.) My lords, and gentlemen, an unknown youth, A vassal in my uncle's hunting train, The selfsame wight who led our dogs to-day, Now boldly enters to the presence, backed By foreign arms, and challenges a right Conferred by our most gracious father's will On valiant Westmoreland, for deeds of love Rendered our house when faction shook the throne. He claims Northumberland; in right of blood Drawn from rebellious Percy. Well you know That name was blotted from the roll of Peers When old Northumberland, from faith scarce pledged, And pardon fell, lending his reverend locks Anew to traitors.âHollow title this! But where the vouchers even for this? His name, He says, is Percy. Sirs, must we believe? Give me a sword,âmy lord of Warwick, thine.â Now, sirrah, prove thy vaunt here on the King. Stand forth, if kin to Hotspur. He had charged Through hosts Infernal to the gates of Hell, Ere Man or Demon twice braved him to combat. Leave, if thou darest, the covert of those spears. Thus bucklered with my mantle, I defy thee Blazing in Percy's arms. Per. That Percy's spirit lives, my lord, A burning, proudly-swelling witness tells me. But blood I seek not. Justiceâ K. Hen. Craven, peace! When Hotspur spoke, his trumpet of alarum, Fire-snorting steed, and shout of onset answered. His thundering descant was on foemen's crests! What lithe-tongued Insolent is this who claims A hero for his sire? Away! away! Doug. Endure these taunting tongues no longer, Percy: Let 's prove ourselves as they would have us. Per. No,â Douglas,âI charge thee on thine oathâ K. Hen. What! dost thou think to daunt us, boy? In arms To parley with the King? I thought, by Heaven, I had some small repute; I thought the world, By this time, knew me.âBare your weapons, lords. Flor. O, Heaven! El. Ah! mother! mother! Lady West. Peace; be still. West. They rue this gambol. Marked you, liege, the flash Of swords unsheathing? Per. Westmoreland, beware! Under these walls a vengeful Spirit wakes More terrible than glared on Brutus. Harm The life he watches, and to-morrow's dawn Finds thee, thy King, this mingled throng, these towers Founded as cliffs, a blasted, smouldering heap Of blood and ashes. West. Babbler, peace! My lord, Now shall we charge? Per. Stay, madman, but a breath Upon this bugle. (Sounds his horn. Mountfort and his party answer, from under the walls, with a terrific blast, that rolls in hollow echoes through the abysses of the Castle, and dies away like distant thunder.) West. Gods! Per. Again, my lord. (Sounds; and is answered by Bertram from the armory above; a third time, by Bardolph from the four corners of the Castle. A pause of astonishment and silence.) West. Is hell disgorged around us? Per. A thousand horns have answered at my call, A thousand spears are brandished for the charge, And never did a thousand bolder hearts Heave under breast-plate for the work of death. (Takes off his helmet, and advances a little.) Can any question who I am, my lords?â If any; speak.âCould falsehood purchase aught But shame, detection, and immediate fall?â My lord and King, this youth, my friend, is Douglas; Born of a race that nicely guards its honor. That spotless honor lies this night at pawn, Sworn to redeem my pledge. (Unclasps his bugle-horn, and casts it round the neck of Douglas.) Doug. (waving his sword.) Clansmen! retire. (Their followers withdraw from the hall, leaving Percy and Douglas alone amidst the royal train.) Per. Scarce was I born, when our brave fathers burst Their solemn league, indissoluble thought, When Percy's hand gave Bolingbroke the crown. I ask not whose the fault in that sad breach. If Percy erred, has not the name yet made Its expiation?âO! my lord, look back! Let Shipton, Shrewsbury, and Bramham-Moor, Let the dire pangs that broke my mother's heart, Let my own banishment and blasted youth, Declare.âI am the last of all the Percies: A name coeval with the crown thou wearest, And prized for ages as its brightest gem. (Throws off his cuirass, and kneels; presenting his sword and breast to the King.) Deathâdeathâor my inheritance! Enact Thy sovereign pleasure, for by Heaven I swear, By Hotspur's ashes, by the faith of Douglas, A hair of thine shall never fall for me. (Exclamations from all sides. The circle presses towards the King, who remains awhile silent.) K. Hen. A desperate game,âbut played out gallantly.â Relenting thoughts and ancient amity Had touched our bosom. Fraught with Percy's pardon, Missives in Scotland bear our seal. His flight Reserves it for his Monarch's lips. Arise, As Percy, Lucy, Poinings, Fitz-Payne, Bryan, Knight of the Garter, Earl Northumberland.â Swear on this sword, faith, fealty, and allegiance, By us, and by our throne, through life, to stand A loyal, brave defender. Per. Swordâlifeâall I dedicateâI consecrateâ K. Hen. Earl Westmoreland, this act makes thee a Marquis. Henceforth, be styled Marquis of Montacute. West. Meet thanks, puissant King. Per. My lord,âmy Sovereign. (Advances through the crowd to Elinor, who, pale and fainting, hangs upon Florence.) Thy royal grace restores my lands, but ah! Add this, (clasping her hand,) or but a sepulchre thou givest! Life were a curse,âa diadem but dust, Bereft of this! West. (aside.) Furies! Per. Plead, plead for me, My gracious master!âStern and frowning eyes Are bent upon me;âfatal, else, this night For ever to my hopes. K. Hen. What says my uncle? West. Deathâ The graveâher bridegroom and her bed shall be, Before that traitor. For my land I took, Without a murmur, as a princely boon, A barren title; but, by all the gods. O'er my own daughter I am Heaven's vicegerent. Lady West. O, heed not, gracious Sovereign,â K. Hen. Have a care, Or troth thou 'lt win a sterile seigniory! For mark ye, my good lord, the King would call That traitorâbrother, friend, or son, more proudly, Than any prince now crowned in Christendom. (To Lady Westmoreland.) Instruct me, lady.âDoth the maid incline? West. I swear, my lord,â K. Hen. (sternly.) Peace, Sir! (Approaches Elinor, who conceals her face on Florence's shoulder.) Per. (in a supplicating voice, still retaining her hand.) Father, and Sovereign!â K. Hen. Fear nothing.âElinor? Flor. She cannot speak: The terrifying tumult yet distracts her. K. Hen. (to Percy.) Forbear:âI see:âno further press to night. (Takes Elinor's hand.) Come, pretty throstle, hie thee to thy nest. A bustling day and night we've had of it, And many cares await thee on the morrow. Let Henry, like a good physician, now Bless, and dismiss thee gravely to repose. But, like a May-Queen, ere the earliest beam Call the young eaglets from their cloud-built bowers, Up, and play hostess with a busy grace. Good Angels guard thee!âLady Florence. (Gives Elinor's hand to Florence.) (Percy whispers Douglas, who goes out.) Per. Did I not fear to seem presumptuous, liege, Once more on bended knees, I'd play the suppliant, For one whose youth in warlike toils was spent To rear the fabric of my grandsire's fame; Whelmed in whose fall, he since has worn away The winter of his age in penury. Foes have miscalled his errors: faults of zeal Too warm for us, not hatred of thy house. Re-enter Douglas, followed by Mountfort.) This ancient manâI pray your Majesty Repeal the sentence of his banishment. K. Hen. Why kneels he not to ask it?âWho is this? Mount. Guy Marmaduke de Mountfort. Per. Gracious liege,â K. Hen. Ha! doth that hoary Rebel live? Mount. Mayhap, nowâ Per. Mountfort, Mountfort, pauseâRemember me! Mount. My joints are stiff, great King. K. Hen. Presumptuous slaveâ Mount. But, Sir, (kneels,) I crave oblivion of the past. K. Hen. I know thy stubborn nature. Greybeard, hence! For Percy's sake, and only for his sake, Take with thee pardon. Doug. Come. (Mountfort rises haughtily, and stalks out with Douglas, muttering.) Per. O! for a tongue!â't is here, 't is here full fraught! But my dull lips are bankrupt. K. Hen. Noble youth, Rough signs are rising: in the Gallic field Thou shalt have leading, and a day to thank me. Dismiss your friends: give audience here to-morrow.â Now, gentlemen, good night. Look to the gates. Disperse. Another day we pass at Warkworth. END OF VOL. I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II. THE JUDGMENT, A VISION. TO JOHN TRUMBULL, ESQ., OF CONNECTICUT, THE AUTHOR OF M?FINGAL, THIS WORK IS RESPECTFULLY INSCRIBED BY HIS OBLIGED AND GRATEFUL FRIEND THE AUTHOR. Beside its intrinsic difficulties, the subject labors under a disadvantage too obvious to have escaped notice. It has so generally occupied the imaginations of believers in the Scriptures, that most have adopted respecting it their own notions: whoever selects it as a theme, therefore, exposes his work to criticism on account of its theology, as well as its poetry; and they who think the former objectionable, will not, easily, be pleased with the latter. The object, however, was not to declare opinions; but simply to present such a view of the last grand spectacle as seemed the most susceptible of poetical embellishment. New York, April, 1821. I. The rites were past of that auspicious day When white-robed altars wreathed with living green Adorn the temples;âwhen unnumbered tongues Repeat the glorious anthem sung to harps Of Angels while the star o'er Bethlehem stood;â When grateful hearts bow low, and deeper joy Breathes in the Christian than the Angel song, On the great birthday of our Priest and King. That night, while musing on his wondrous life, Precepts, and promises to be fulfilled, A trance-like sleep fell on me, and a dream Of dreadful character appalled my soul. Wild was the pageant:âface to face with Kings, Heroes, and Sages of old note, I stood; Patriarchs, and Prophets, and Apostles saw, And venerable forms, ere round the globe Shoreless and waste a weltering flood was rolled, With Angels, compassing the radiant throne Of Mary's Son, anew descended, crowned With glory terrible, to judge the world. II. Methought I journeyed o'er a boundless plain Unbroke by vale or hill, on all sides stretched, Like circling ocean, to the low-browed sky; Save in the midst a verdant mount whose sides Flowers of all hues and fragrant breath adorned. Lightly I trod, as on some joyous quest, Beneath the azure vault and early sun; But while my pleased eyes ranged the circuit green, New light shone round; a murmur came, confused, Like many voices and the rush of wings. Upward I gazed, and 'mid the glittering skies, Begirt by flying myriads, saw a throne Whose thousand splendors blazed upon the earth Refulgent as another sun. Through clouds They came, and vapors colored by Aurora, Mingling in swell sublime, voices, and harps, And sounding wings, and hallelujahs sweet. Sudden, a Seraph that before them flew, Pausing upon his wide-unfolded plumes, Put to his mouth the likeness of a trump, And toward the four winds four times fiercely breathed. Doubling along the arch, the mighty peal To Heaven resounded, Hell returned a groan, And shuddering Earth a moment reeled, confounded, From her fixed pathway as the staggering ship, Stunned by some mountain billow, reels. The isles, With heaving ocean, rocked: the mountains shook Their ancient coronets: the avalanche Thundered: silence succeeded through the nations. Earth never listened to a sound like this. It struck the general pulse of nature still, And broke, for ever, the dull sleep of death. III. Now, o'er the mount the radiant legions hung, Like plumy travellers from climes remote On some sequestered isle about to stoop. Gently its flowery head received the throne, Cherubs and Seraphs, by ten thousands, round Skirting it far and wide, like a bright sea, Fair forms and faces, crowns, and coronets, And glistering wings furled white and numberless. About their Lord were those Seven glorious Spirits Who in the Almighty's presence stand. Four leaned On golden wands, with folded wings, and eyes Fixed on the throne: one bore the dreadful Books, The arbiters of life: another waved The blazing ensign terrible, of yore, To rebel Angels in the wars of Heaven: What seemed a trump the other Spirit grasped, Of wondrous size, wreathed multiform and strange. Illustrious stood the Seven, above the rest Towering, and like a constellation glowing, What time the sphere-instructed Huntsman, taught By Atlas, his star-studded belt displays Aloft, bright-glittering, in the winter sky. IV. Then on the mount, amidst these glorious shapes, Who reverent stood, with looks of sacred awe, I saw Emmanuel seated on his throne. His robe, methought, was whiter than the light; Upon his breast the Heavenly Urim glowed Bright as the sun, and round such lightnings flashed, No eye could meet the mystic symbol's blaze. Irradiant the eternal sceptre shone Which wont to glitter in his Father's hand: Resplendent in his face the Godhead beamed, Justice and mercy, majesty and grace, Divinely mingling. Celestial glories played Around with beamy lustre; from his eye Dominion looked; upon his brow was stamped Creative Power. Yet over all the touch Of gracious pity dwelt, which, erst, amidst Dissolving nature's anguish breathed a prayer For guilty man. Redundant down his neck His locks rolled graceful, as they waved, of old, Upon the mournful breeze of Calvary. V. His throne of heavenly substance seemed composed, Whose pearly essence, like the eastern shell, Or changeful opal, shed a silvery light. Clear as the moon it looked through ambient clouds Of snowy lustre waving round its base, That, like a zodiac, thick with emblems set, Flashed wondrous beams, of unknown character, From many a burning stone of lustre rare, Stained like the bow whose mingling splendor streamed Confusion bright upon the dazzled eye. Above him hung a canopy whose skirts The mount o'ershadowed like an evening cloud. Clouds were his curtains: not like their dim types Of blue and purple round the tabernacle, That waving vision of the lonely wild, By pious Israel wrought with cherubims; Veiling the mysteries of old renown, Table, and altar, ark, and mercy-seat, Where, 'twixt the shadow of cherubic wings, In lustre visible Jehovah shone. VI. In honor chief, upon the Lord's right hand His station Michael held: the dreadful sword That from a starry baldric hung, proclaimed The Hierarch. Terrible, on his brow Blazed the Archangel crown, and from his eye Thick sparkles flashed. Like regal banners, waved Back from his giant shoulders his broad vans, Bedropt with gold, and, turning to the sun, Shone gorgeous as the multitudinous stars, Or some illumined city seen by night, When her wide streets pour noon, and echoing through Her thronging thousands mirth and music ring. Opposed to him, I saw an Angel stand In sable vesture, with the Books of Life. Black was his mantle, and his changeful wings Glossed like the raven's; thoughtful seemed his mien, Sedate and calm, and deep upon his brow Had Meditation set her seal: his eyes Looked things unearthly, thoughts unutterable, Or uttered only with an Angel's tongue. Renowned was he among the Seraphim For depth of prescience, and sublimest lore; Skilled in the mysteries of the Eternal, Profoundly versed in those old records where, From everlasting ages, live God's deeds; He knew the hour when yonder shining worlds, That roll around us, into being sprang; Their system, laws, connexion; all he knew But the dread moment when they cease to be. None judged like him the ways of God to man, Or so had pondered; his excursive thoughts Had visited the depths of Night and Chaos, Gathering the treasures of the hoary deep. VII. Like ocean's billows seemed, ere this, the plain, Confusedly heaving with a sumless host From earth's and time's remotest bounds: a roar Went up before the multitude, whose course The unfurled banner guided, and the bow, Zone of the universe, athwart the zenith Sweeping its arch. In one vast conflux rolled, Wave following wave, were men of every age, Nation, and tongue; all heard the warning blast, And, led by wondrous impulse, hither came. Mingled in wild confusion, now, those met In distant ages born. Gray forms, that lived When Time himself was young, whose temples shook The hoary honors of a thousand years, Stood side by side with Roman Consuls:âhere, 'Mid Prophets old, and Heaven-inspired Bards, Were Grecian heroes seen:âthere, from a crowd Of reverend Patriarchs, towered the nodding plumes, Tiars, and helms, and sparkling diadems Of Persia's, Egypt's, or Assyria's Kings; Clad as when forth the hundred gates of Thebes On sounding cars her hundred Princes rushed; Or, when, at night, from off the terrace top Of his aÃ«rial garden, touched to soothe The troubled Monarch, came the solemn chime Of sackbut, psaltery, and harp, adown The Euphrates, floating in the moonlight wide O'er sleeping Babylon. For all appeared As in their days of earthly pride; the clank Of steel announced the Warrior, and the robe Of Tyrian lustre spoke the blood of Kings. Though on the Angels while I gazed, their names Appeared not, yet amongst the mortal throng (Capricious power of dreams!) familiar seemed Each countenance, and every name well known. VIII. Nearest the mount, of that mixed phalanx first, Our general Parent stood: not as he looked Wandering, at eve, amid the shady bowers And odorous groves of that delicious garden, Or flowery banks of some soft-rolling stream, Pausing to list its lulling murmur, hand In hand with peerless Eve, the rose too sweet, Fatal to Paradise. Fled from his cheek The bloom of Eden; his hyacinthine locks Were changed to gray; with years and sorrows bowed He seemed, but through his ruined form still shone The majesty of his Creator: round Upon his sons a grieved and pitying look He cast, and in his vesture hid his face. IX. Close at his side appeared a martial form Of port majestic, clad in massive arms, Cowering above whose helm with outspread wings The Roman eagle flew; around its brim Was charactered the name at which Earth's Queen Bowed from her seven-fold throne and owned her lord. In his dilated eye amazement stood; Terror, surprise, and blank astonishment Blanched his firm cheek, as when, of old, close hemmed Within the Capitol, amidst the crowd Of traitors, fearless else, he caught the gleam Of Brutus' steel. Daunted, yet on the pomp Of towering Seraphim, their wings, their crowns, Their dazzling faces, and upon the Lord He fixed a steadfast look of anxious note, Like that Pharsalia's hurtling squadrons drew When all his fortunes hung upon the hour. X. Near him, for wisdom famous through the East, Abraham rested on his staff; in guise A Chaldee shepherd, simple in his raiment As when at Mamre in his tent he sat, The host of Angels. Snow-white were his locks And silvery beard that to his girdle rolled. Fondly his meek eye dwelt upon his Lord, Like one, that, after long and troubled dreams, A night of sorrows, dreary, wild, and sad, Beholds, at last, the dawn of promised joys. With kindred looks his great Descendant gazed. Not in the poor array of shepherds he, Nor in the many-colored coat, fond gift Of doting age, and cause of direful hate; But, stately as his native palm, his form Was, like Egyptian Princes, proudly decked In tissued purple sweeping to the ground. Plumes from the desert waved above his head, And down his breast the golden collar hung Bestowed by Pharaoh when through Egypt word Went forth to bow the knee as to her King. Graced thus, his chariot with impetuous wheels Bore him toward Goshen, where the fainting heart Of Israel waited for his long-lost son, The son of Rachel. Ah! had she survived To see him in his glory!âAs he rode, His boyhood, and his mother's tent, arose, Linked with a thousand recollections dear, And Joseph's heart was in the tomb by Ephrath. XI. At hand, a group of Sages marked the scene. Plato and Socrates together stood, With him who measured by their shades those piles Gigantic, 'mid the desert seen, at eve, By toiling caravans for Memphis bound, Peering like specks above the horizon's verge, Whose huge foundations vanish in the mist Of earliest time. Transfixed they seemed with wonder, Awe-struck,âamazement rapt their inmost souls. Such glance of deep inquiry and suspense They threw around, as, in untutored ages, Astronomers upon some dark eclipse, Close counselling amidst the dubious light If it portended Nature's death, or spoke A change in Heaven. What thought they, then, of all Their idle dreams, their proud Philosophy, When on their wildered souls redemption, Christ, And the Almighty broke? But, though they erred When all was dark, they reasoned for the Truth. They sought in earth, in ocean, and the stars, Their maker, arguing from his works toward God; And from his Word had not less nobly argued, Had they beheld the Gospel sending forth Its pure effulgence o'er the farthest sea, Lighting the idol mountain-tops, and gilding The banners of salvation there. These men Ne'er slighted a Redeemer; of his name They never heard. Perchance their late-found harps, Mixing with Angel symphonies, may sound In strains more rapturous things to them so new. XII. Nearer the mount stood Moses; in his hand The rod which blasted with strange plagues the realm Of Misraim, and from its time-worn channels Upturned the Arabian sea. Fair was his broad High front, and forth from his soul-piercing eye Did Legislation look; which full he fixed Upon the blazing panoply, undazzled. No terrors had the scene for him who, oft, Upon the thunder-shaken hill-top, veiled With smoke and lightnings, with Jehovah talked, And from his fiery hand received the Law. Beyond the Jewish Ruler banded close, A company full glorious, I saw The twelve Apostles stand. O, with what looks Of ravishment and joy, what rapturous tears, What hearts of ecstasy, they gazed again On their beloved Master! what a tide Of overwhelming thoughts pressed to their souls When now, as he so frequent promised, throned, And circled by the hosts of Heaven, they traced The well-known lineaments of him who shared Their wants and sufferings here! Full many a day Of fasting spent with him, and night of prayer, Rushed on their swelling hearts. Before the rest, Close to the Angelic spears, had Peter urged, Tears in his eye, love throbbing at his breast, As if to touch his vesture, or to catch The murmur of his voice. On him and them Jesus beamed down benignant looks of love. XIII. How diverse from the front sublime of Paul, Or pale and placid dignity of him Who in the lonely Isle saw Heaven unveiled, Was his who in twelve summers won a world! Not such his countenance nor garb, as when He foremost breasted the broad Granicus, Dark-rushing through its steeps from lonely Ida, His double-tufted plume conspicuous mark Of every arrow; cheering his bold steed Through pikes, and spears, and threatening axes, up The slippery bank through all their chivalry, Princes and Satraps linked for Cyrus' throne, With cuirass pierced, cleft helm, and plumeless head, To youthful conquest: or, when, panic-struck, Darius from his plunging chariot sprang, Away the bow and mantle cast, and fled. His robe, all splendid from the silk-worm's loom, Floated effeminate, and from his neck Hung chains of gold, and gems from Eastern mines. Bedight with many-colored plumage, flamed His proud tiara, plumage which had spread Its glittering dies of scarlet, green, and gold, To evening suns by Indus' stream: around Twined careless, glowed the white and purple band, The imperial sacred badge of Persia's kings. Thus his triumphal car in Babylon Displayed him, drawn by snow-white elephants, Whose feet crushed odors from the flowery wreaths Boy-Cupids scattered, while soft music breathed And incense fumed around. But dire his hue, Bloated and bacchanal as on the night When old Persepolis was wrapped in flame! Fear, over all had flung a livid tinge. A deeper awe subdued him than amazed Parmenio and the rest, when they beheld The white-stoled Levites from Jerusalem, Thrown open as on some high festival, With hymns and solemn pomp, come down the hill To meet the incensed King, and wondering saw, As on the Pontiff's awful form he gazed, Glistering in purple with his mystic gems, Jove's vaunted son, at Jaddua's foot, adore. XIV. Turn, now, where stood the spotless Virgin: sweet Her azure eye, and fair her golden ringlets; But changeful as the hues of infancy Her face. As on her son, her God, she gazed, Fixed was her look,âearnest, and breathless;ânow, Suffused her glowing cheek; now, changed to pale;â First, round her lip a smile celestial played, Then, fast, fast rained the tears.âWho can interpret?â Perhaps some thought maternal crossed her heart; That mused on days long passed, when on her breast He helpless lay, and of his infant smile; Or, on those nights of terror when, from worse Than wolves, she hasted with her babe to Egypt. XV. Girt by a crowd of Monarchs, of whose fame Scarce a memorial lives, who fought and reigned While the historic lamp shed glimmering light, Above the rest one regal port aspired, Crowned like Assyria's princes; not a crest O'ertopped him save the giant Seraphim. His countenance, more piercing than the beam Of the sun-gazing eagle, earthward bent Its haught, fierce majesty tempered with awe. Seven years with brutish herds had quelled his pride, And taught him there 's a mightier King in Heaven. His powerful arm founded old Babylon, Whose bulwarks like the eternal mountains heaved Their adamantine heads, whose brazen gates Beleaguering nations foiled, and bolts of war, Unshaken, answered as the pelting hail. House of the Kingdom! glorious Babylon! Earth's marvel, and of unborn time the theme! Say where thou stood'st:âor, can the fisherman Plying his task on the Euphrates, now, A silent, silver, unpolluted tide, Point to thy grave, and answer? From a sash O'er his broad shoulder hung the ponderous sword, Fatal as sulphurous fires to Nineveh, That levelled with her waves the walls of Tyrus Queen of the Sea, to its foundations shook Jerusalem, and reaped the fields of Egypt. XVI. Endless the task to name the multitudes From every land, from isles remote, in seas Which no adventurous mariner has sailed:â From desert-girdled cities, of whose pomp Some solitary wanderer, by the stars Conducted o'er the burning wilderness, Has told a doubted tale: as Europe's sons Describing Mexic' and, in fair Peru, The gorgeous Temple of the Sun, its Priests, Its Virgin, and its fire for ever bright, Were fablers deemed, and, for belief, met scorn. Around while gazing thus, far in the sky Appeared what looked, at first, a moving star; But onward, wheeling through the clouds it came, With brightening splendor and increasing size, Till within ken a fiery chariot rushed, By flaming horses drawn, whose heads shot forth A twisted, horn-like beam. O'er its fierce wheels Two shining forms alighted on the mount, Of mortal birth, but deathless rapt to Heaven. Adown their breasts their loose beards floated, white As mist by moonbeams silvered; fair they seemed, And bright as Angels; fellowship with Heaven Their mortal grossness so had purified. Lucent their mantles; other than the Seer By Jordan caught; and in the Prophet's face A mystic lustre, like the Urim's, gleamed. XVII. Now for the dread tribunal all prepared, Before the throne the Angel with the Books Ascending kneeled, and crossing on his breast His sable pinions there the volumes spread. A second summons echoed from the trump, Thrice sounded, when the mighty work began. Waved onward by a Seraph's wand, the sea Of palpitating bosoms toward the mount In silence rolled. No sooner had the first Pale tremblers its mysterious circle touched Than instantaneous, swift as fancy's flash, As lightning darting from the summer cloud, Its past existence rose before the soul, With all its deeds, with all its secret store Of embryo works, and dark imaginings. Amidst the chaos, thoughts as numberless As whirling leaves when autumn strips the woods, Light and disjointed as the Sibyl's, thoughts Scattered upon the waste of long dim years, Passed in a moment through the quickened soul. Not with the glozing eye of earth beheld; They saw as with the glance of Deity. Conscience, stern arbiter in every breast, Decided. Self acquitted or condemned, Through two broad glittering avenues of spears They crossed the Angelic squadrons, right, or left The Judgment-seat; by power supernal led To their allotted stations on the plain. As onward, onward, numberless, they came, And touched, appalled, the verge of Destiny, The Heavenly Spirits inly sympathized:â When youthful saints, or martyrs scarred and white, With streaming faces, hands ecstatic clasped, Sprang to the right, celestial beaming smiles A ravishing beauty to their radiance gave; But downcast looks of pity chilled the left. What clenched hands, and frenzied steps were there! Yet, on my shuddering soul, the stifled groan, Wrung from some proud Blasphemer as he rushed, Constrained by conscience, down the path of death, Knells horrible.âOn all the hurrying throng The unerring pen stamped, as they passed, their fate. Thus, in a day, amazing thought! were judged The millions since from the Almighty's hand, Launched on her course, earth rolled rejoicing. Whose The doom to penal fires, and whose to joy, From man's presumption mists and darkness veil. So passed the day; divided stood the world, An awful line of separation drawn, And from his labors the Messiah ceased. XVIII. By this, the sun his westering car drove low; Round his broad wheel full many a lucid cloud Floated, like happy isles, in seas of gold: Along the horizon castled shapes were piled, Turrets and towers whose fronts embattled gleamed With yellow light: smit by the slanting ray, A ruddy beam the canopy reflected; With deeper light the ruby blushed; and thick Upon the Seraphs' wings the glowing spots Seemed drops of fire. Uncoiling from its staff With fainter wave, the gorgeous ensign hung, Or, swelling with the swelling breeze, by fits, Cast off upon the dewy air huge flakes Of golden lustre. Over all the hill, The Heavenly legions, the assembled world, Evening her crimson tint for ever drew. XIX. But while at gaze, in solemn silence, Men And Angels stood, and many a quaking heart With expectation throbbed; about the throne And glittering hill-top slowly wreathed the clouds, Erewhile like curtains for adornment hung, Involving Shiloh and the Seraphim Beneath a snowy tent. The bands around, Eyeing the gonfalon that through the smoke Towered into air, resembled hosts who watch The King's pavilion where, ere battle hour, A council sits. What their consult might be, Those seven dread Spirits and their Lord, I mused, I marvelled. Was it grace, and peace?âor death? Was it of Man?âDid pity for the Lost His gentle nature wring, who knew, who felt How frail is this poor tenement of clay? For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities.â Heb. iv. 15.â Arose there from the misty tabernacle A cry like that upon GethsemanÃ©?â What passed in Jesus' bosom none may know, But close the cloudy dome invested him; And, weary with conjecture, round I gazed Where in the purple west, no more to dawn, Faded the glories of the dying day. Mild twinkling through a crimson-skirted cloud The solitary star of Evening shone. While gazing wistful on that peerless light Thereafter to be seen no more, (as, oft, In dreams strange images will mix,) sad thoughts Passed o'er my soul. Sorrowing, I cried, âFarewell, Pale, beauteous Planet, that displayest so soft Amid yon glowing streak thy transient beam, A long, a last farewell! Seasons have changed, Ages, and empires rolled, like smoke, away, But thou, unaltered, beamest as silver fair As on thy birthnight! Bright and watchful eyes, From palaces and bowers, have hailed thy gem With secret transport! Natal star of love, And souls that love the shadowy hour of fancy, How much I owe thee, how I bless thy ray! How oft thy rising o'er the hamlet green, Signal of rest, and social converse sweet, Beneath some patriarchal tree, has cheered The peasant's heart, and drawn his benison! Pride of the West! beneath thy placid light The tender tale shall never more be told, Man's soul shall never wake to joy again: Thou set'st for ever,âlovely Orb, farewell!â XX. Low warblings, now, and solitary harps Were heard among the Angels, touched and tuned As to an evening hymn, preluding soft To Cherub voices; louder as they swelled, Deep strings struck in, and hoarser instruments, Mixed with clear silver sounds, till concord rose Full as the harmony of winds to Heaven; Yet sweet as nature's springtide melodies To some worn Pilgrim first with glistening eyes Greeting his native valley, whence the sounds Of rural gladness, herds, and bleating flocks, The chirp of birds, blithe voices, lowing kine, The dash of waters, reed, or rustic pipe, Blent with the dulcet, distance-mellowed bell, Come, like the echo of his early joys. In every pause, from spirits in mid air, Responsive still were golden viols heard, And Heavenly symphonies stole faintly down. XXI. Calm, deep, and silent was the tide of joy That rolled o'er all the Blessed; visions of bliss, Rapture too mighty, swelled their hearts to bursting; Prelude to Heaven it seemed, and in their sight Celestial glories swam. How fared, alas! That other Band? Sweet to their troubled minds The solemn scene; ah! doubly sweet the breeze Refreshing, and the purple light to eyes But newly oped from that benumbing sleep Whose dark and drear abode no cheering dream, No bright-hued vision ever enters, souls For ages pent, perhaps, in some dim world Where guilty spectres stalk the twilight gloom. For, like the spirit's last seraphic smile, The Earth, anticipating now her tomb, To rise, perhaps, as Heaven magnificent, Appeared Hesperian: gales of gentlest wing Came fragrance-laden, and such odors shed As Yemen never knew, nor those blest Isles In Indian seas where the voluptuous breeze The peaceful Native breathes, at eventide, From nutmeg groves and bowers of cinnamon. How solemn on their ears the choral note Swelled of the Angel hymn! so late escaped The cold embraces of the grave, whose damp Silence no voice or stringed instrument Has ever broke! Yet with the murmuring breeze Full sadly chimed the music and the song, For with them came the memory of joys For ever past, the stinging thought of what They once had been, and of their future lot. To their grieved view the passages of Earth Delightful rise, their tender ligaments So dear, they heeded not an after state, Though by a fearful Judgment ushered in. A Bridegroom fond, who lavished all his heart On his Beloved, forgetful of the Man Of many sorrows, who, for him, resigned His meek and spotless spirit on the cross, Has marked among the Blessed Bands, arrayed Celestial in a spring of beauty doomed No more to fade, the charmer of his soul, Her cheek soft blooming like the dawn in Heaven. He recollects the days when on his smile She lived; when, gently leaning on his breast, Tears of intense affection dimmed her eyes, Of dove-like lustre.âThoughtless, now, of him And earthly joys, eternity and Heaven Engross her soul.âWhat more accursed pang Can Hell inflict? With her, in realms of light, In never-dying bliss, he might have rolled Eternity away; but now, for ever, Torn from his Bride new-found, with cruel Fiends, Or Men like Fiends, must waste and weep. Now, now, He mourns with burning, bitter drops his days Misspent, probation lost, and Heaven despised. Such thoughts from many a bursting heart drew forth Groans, lamentations, and despairing shrieks, That on the silent air came from afar. XXII. As, when from some proud capital that crowns Imperial Ganges, the reviving breeze Sweeps the dank mist, or hoary river fog Impervious mantled o'er her highest towers, Bright on the eye rush Brahma's temples capped With spiry tops, gay-trellised minarets, Pagods of gold, and mosques with burnished domes, Gilded, and glistening in the morning sun, So from the hill the cloudy curtains rolled, And, in the lingering lustre of the eve, Again the Saviour and his Seraphs shone. Emitted sudden in his rising, flashed Intenser light, as toward the right hand host Mild turning with a look ineffable, The invitation he proclaimed in accents Which on their ravished ears poured thrilling, like The silver sound of many trumpets heard Afar in sweetest jubilee; then, swift Stretching his dreadful sceptre to the left That shot forth horrid lightnings, in a voice Clothed but in half its terrors, yet to them Seemed like the crush of Heaven, pronounced the doom. The sentence uttered, as with life instinct, The throne uprose majestically slow; Each angel spread his wings; in one dread swell Of triumph mingling as they mounted, trumpets, And harps, and golden lyres, and timbrels sweet, And many a strange and deep-toned instrument Of Heavenly minstrelsy unknown on Earth, And Angels' voices, and the loud acclaim Of all the ransomed, like a thunder-shout. Far through the skies melodious echoes rolled, And faint hosannas distant climes returned. XXIII. Down from the lessening multitude came faint And fainter still the trumpet's dying peal, All else in distance lost, when to receive Their new inhabitants the heavens unfolded. Up gazing, then, with streaming eyes, a glimpse The Wicked caught of Paradise, whence streaks Of splendor, golden quivering radiance shone, As when the showery evening sun takes leave, Breaking a moment o'er the illumined world. Seen far within, fair forms moved graceful by, Slow turning to the light their snowy wings. A deep-drawn agonizing groan escaped The hapless Outcasts, when upon the Lord The glowing portals closed. Undone, they stood Wistfully gazing on the cold, gray heaven, As if to catch, alas! a hope not there. But shades began to gather, night approached Murky and lowering: round with horror rolled On one another their despairing eyes That glared with anguish: starless, hopeless gloom Fell on their souls, never to know an end. Though in the far horizon lingered yet A lurid gleam, black clouds were mustering there; Red flashes, followed by low muttering sounds, Announced the fiery tempest doomed to hurl The fragments of the Earth again to Chaos. Wild gusts swept by, upon whose hollow wing Unearthly voices, yells, and ghastly peals Of demon laughter came. Infernal shapes Flitted along the sulphurous wreaths, or plunged Their dark, impure abyss, as sea-fowl dive Their watery element.âO'erwhelmed with sights And sounds appalling, I awoke; and found For gathering storms, and signs of coming woe, The midnight moon gleaming upon my bed Serene and peaceful. Gladly I surveyed her Walking in brightness through the stars of heaven, And blessed the respite ere the day of doom. SACHEM'S-WOOD; A SHORT POEM, WITH NOTES. Fellow-Citizens: The sweet-blowing breezes of these regenerated times have stimulated a before drooping fancy, (even in extremely warm weather!) to the task of weaving a few rhymes; which, as they relate to local matters, I beg you to accept, as a testimony of renewed pleasure and pride in my native State. New Haven, 30 July, 1838. Farewell to âHighwoodâ! name made dear By lips we never more can hear! That came, unsought for, as I lay, Musing o'er landscapes far away; Expressive just of what one sees, The upland slope, the stately trees; Oaks, prouder that beneath their shade His lair the valiant Pequot made, Whose name, whose gorgon lock alone, Turned timid hearts to demi-stone. Within this green pavilion stood, Oft, the dark princes of the wood, Debating whether Philip's cause Were paramount to Nature's laws;â Whether the tomahawk and knife Should, at his bidding, smoke with life;â Or pact endure, with guileless hands, Pipes lit for peace, and paid-for lands, With men, who slighted frowns from kings, Yet kept their faith in humblest things, The âPillarsâ of our infant state, Seven in number, with John Davenport and Theophilus Eaton at their head, the founders of New Haven, then a separate jurisdiction. (See Professor Kingsley's Historical Discourse on the Two Hundredth Anniversary of the Settlement of New Haven.) Shafts, now, in Zion's upper gate. How changed, how softened, since the trail Suddenly turned the finder pale; Since Highwood's dells, a tangled brake, Harboured the otter, deer, and snake; Since to St. Ronan's sparkling brink The wolf and wildcat came to drink; Since our good sires, in their old hall, Met armed for combat, prayer, and all! Now, from this bench, the gazer sees Towers and white steeples o'er the trees, Mansions that peep from leafy bowers, And villas blooming close by ours; Hears the grave clocks, and classic bell, Hours for the mind and body tell; Or starts, and questions, as the gong Bids urchins not disport too long. A blended murmur minds the ear That an embosomed City 's near. See! how its guardian Giants tower, Changing their aspects with the hour!â There, Sassacus, East Rock. in shade or glow, Hot with the noon, or white with snow, Dark in the dawn, at evening red, Or rolling vapors round his head, A type of grandeur ever stands, From God's benignant, graceful hands! Once, on his top the Pequot stood, And gazed o'er all the world of wood, Eyed the blue Sound, and scanned the bays, Distinct in evening's mellow rays, For ships, pursuing on the main, As Mason tracked him o'er the plain. Like a green map, lay all below, With glittering veins where rivers flow. The Island loomed, in soft repose;â No spire, no mast, no mansion rose;â Smokes, here and there, from out the screen Denoted still an Indian scene; One, only, native roof he sees, Where Belmont now o'erlooks the trees. The name by which its former owners designated the eminence on which Henry Whitney, Esq., is now erecting a seat,âin full and near view from the top of Sassacus. The time alluded to was the year 1637. New Haven was founded in 1638. The distance stretched in haze away, As from his Mount by Mystic bay, Whence, as the calumet went round, His eyes could measure all the Sound, Or, in the boundless Ocean, find Delight for his untutored mind. Far eastward steals his glistening eye, There, where his throne, his people lie, Lie prostrateâsubjects, children, power, All, all extinguished in an hour. âThus,â (at the taking of Mystic Fort,) âparents and children, the sannup and squaw, the old man and the babe, perished in promiscuous ruin.ââ Trumb. Vol. I. p. 86. The heart-wrung savage turned aside,â But no tears stained a Pequot's pride; The dark hand spread upon his breast, Only, the wampum grasped and pressed: He turned,âhe stopped,âtook one last view,â And then, like Regulus, withdrew. These mountains, rivers, woods, and plain, Ne'er saw the Pequot King again; Far in the regions of the west, The Mohawk sent him to his rest. No Pale-face boasted; none made bold To touch that lock, till he was cold. Shall no memorial in the land Remain of Sassacus? Like sand Beat by the sea, shall every trace Of the great spirit of his race, Be swept away?âNo longer, tame Mountains by an ignoble name. Let Sassacus for ever tower, Changing his aspect with the hour! Sassacus was the great prince of the nation.ââWhen the English began their settlements at Connecticut,â (a previous affair to the establishment of New Haven,) he had âtwenty-six Sachems under him.âââHis principal fort was on a commanding and most beautiful eminence, in the town of Groton, a few miles southeasterly from Fort Griswold. It commanded one of the finest prospects of the Sound and the adjacent country, which is to be found on the coast. He had another fort near Mystic River, a few miles to the eastward of this, called Mystic Fort. This was also erected on a beautiful hill or eminence, gradually descending to the south and southeast.âââThe Pequots, Mohegans, and Nehantics could doubtless muster a thousand bowmen.ââThe Narragansets said of Sassacus, that he âwas all one God; no man could kill him.ââ Trumb. Vol. I. pp. 41â43. The lock from his scalp, was carried to Boston by Mr. Ludlow, âas a rare sight, and sure demonstration of the death of their mortal enemy.ââ Ib. 92. Of this formidable individual, Roger Wolcott, one of the old governors of Connecticut, says,âGreat was his glory, greater still his pride, Much by himself, and others, magnified.â In the soft west, as day declines, The Regicide, West Rock. his rival, shines; Whose noble outline on the sky Draws, and detains, the enamoured eye, For, floating there, the steeds of eve Flakes from their ruddy nostrils leave. In his wild solitudes, of old, The patriot Outlaws kept their hold. When foreign optics that way dart, A thrill electric wakes the heart; Imagination hurries o'er Our early annals, and before; Flits, and is gone, from that lone Rock, To the sad pageant of the block. Seldom, a real scene you see So full of sweet variety; The gentle objects near at hand, The distant, flowing, bold, and grand. I 've seen the world, from side to side, Walked in the ways of human pride, Mused in the palaces of kings, And know what wealth to grandeur brings; The spot for me, of all the earth, Is this, the dear one of my birth. Go, search the page of Grecian lore, Scan all the men, and deeds, of yore, Read how the Kingless Power grew great, And note how wolf-cubs found a state; Go, feast among the Feudal brave; Go, quaff with robbers in their cave; Try, what distinction reason's eye 'Twixt towers and caverns can espy. Then mark how our âSeven Pillarsâ rise, Built up, like those which prop the skies, On Justice, Truth, and Peace, and Love, With Grace cemented from Above! Where is the violence or wrong Done to the weak, as we grew strong? Where is the record of disgrace We blush, or ought to blush, to face? What landless Indian could declare Our shameful arts to peel him bare? Or, justly change, if armed with powers, A mete or landmark claimed as ours? The spot most blameless of the earth Is this, the sweet one of my birth; This, and the land where virtuous Penn Followed his Saviour out, with men. Vicarious agency, we know, Is Heaven's proceeding here below. Through others' faith, in others' stead, Mercies find access to our head. Our fathers' noble self-denial Purchased a treasure we 've on trial; Which low ambition, avarice, crimes, May turn to dross in after times. They, who, in Newman's barn, laid down Scripture âfoundationsâ for the town; See Kingsley's Discourse; also Bacon's Historical Sermons. The men, I say, whose practic mind Left Locke and Plato far behind, They drank the cup, they bore the pain, And see! what crowns our native plain! So, by another's taste and toil, Highwood was snatched from common soil, Its oaks preserved, and we placed here, With thanks to crown the circling year. Ah! what a race by him was run, Whose day began before the sun; Who, at the sultry hour of noon, Felt action, action still a boon; Who, at the weary shut of eve, No respite needed, no reprieve; But, in those hours when others rest, Kept public care upon his breast! Need we demand a cherished thought For one whose lavish labors brought Health, comfort, value, praise, and grace, (Even for our bones a resting-place,) To the loved spot for which he stood, When neighbour townsmen gasped in blood?â But Heaven leaves not to human praise The recompense of well-spent days. The cheerful morn, the short, sweet night, The mind, as sunshine, ever bright, Approving conscience, growing store; (For though God took, he gave back more;) A breast, like Hector's, of such space, That strength and sweetness could embrace; Power to endure, and soul to feel No hardship such, for others' weal; Ardor, that logic could not shake; Resource, the nonplus ne'er to take; A filial love of mother earth, That made keen labor sweet as mirth;â All, brought him to his age so green, Stamped him so reverend, so serene, A stranger cried, (half turning round,) âThat face is worth a thousand pound!â Urged by a simple, antique zeal, Which spoils-men are too wise to feel, He traversed States like stents for boys; Stints is the proper word. Huge forests pierced o'er corduroys;â Now, grain by grain, the folios sifted, Through which some Proteus title shifted;â Now, o'er deep fords, by night, as day, O'er mountain ledges, picked his way; Here, on his path, the savage glaring, There, savage whites his gray head daring:â Still,ârain, or snow, or mirk, or mire,â Tracks were the tokens of the sire! Tracks of a minim called Young Jin, His sulky that you see me in! The patient sparkle in his eye, Said he would yet sup Jordan dry. âHe trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth; his nose pierceth through snares.ââ Job, of Behemoth. Fancy oft bids affection mark His little, onward-toiling ark, Like a dark speck, on some hill's breast, Climbing, to vanish in the West; And asks, what thoughts sustained and cheered, What were his hopes, and what he feared? If aught he feared, 't was not that Eye, Certain the upright to descry, That watched through houseless wilds his way, Kept him in darkness safe as day, And, doubtless, soothed his journeyings lone, As that meek Servant's of his own. Like a ripe ear, at last he bends Close on the brink, that trial ends. None saw his spirit in decay, Or marked his vigor ebb away. Grace bade him lay his own white head, For the last time, on his own bed, Then, as to spare the gloom of death, Took, at a draft, the Sachem's breath. The sobriquet by which James Hillhouse was known in Congress and elsewhere.âThe result of his labors in behalf of the Connecticut School Fund, alluded to in some of the foregoing lines, may be taken in the words of a scrupulous and well-informed narrator, it having been previously stated, that its affairs had fallen into an entangled condition. âThe best friends of that fund, and those most acquainted with its history, have said, that they would have been happy to have realized from it, at that time, eight hundred thousand dollars. After fifteen years' management, he left it increased to one million seven hundred thousand dollars of solid property. The difference was to be ascribed to his skill, his fidelity, his accuracy, his patience, and his wonderful and indefatigable industry. While that fund shall be perpetuated, and shall continue to carry through all the streets of our cities, and every rude, secluded hamlet among our hills, the blessings of instruction, it will stand a monument to his faithful and disinterested patriotism.ââThe toils he underwent, (for the property consisted chiefly in lands scattered in five States, some parts of them then very difficult of access,) and the expedients he resorted to, in accomplishing his great objects, cannot even be shadowed here. They were highly curious and interesting. He was literally âin journeyings often,âin watchings often,âin hunger and thirst, âin perils from robbers,âin perils in the wilderness,ââ to say nothing of his perils nearer home, âamong false brethren.â Once, he was frost-bitten; losing, in consequence, during the greater part of a winter, and far from his family, the use of one eye: but I have been assured that he did not, even then, spare the other. Once he was arrested as a criminal, by an enraged debtor, who, in his own neighbourhood, exercised a party influence, and but just escaped the indignity of a prison. Twice he was brought to death's door, by fevers taken in the unsettled and unwholesome regions he was obliged to visit. When persuaded, with some difficulty, that the public welfare required him at this arduous post, in the same spirit in which Mr. Jay, yielding to the arguments of Washington, undertook the ungracious task of the British treaty, he flung up his third term in the Senate of the United States, then just commencing, He came into the Senate in 1796, in the place either of Chief Justice Ellsworth, or of Governor Trumbull, who both went out the same year; served the remainder of his predecessor's term, went through two terms of his own, and had commenced the third, when his resignation took place in 1810,âhaving been fourteen years in the Senate, and five in the House of Representatives. He was three times elected to Congress under the Old Confederation, but declined taking his seat. The foregoing dates are from the American Almanac, for 1834. and entered on a series of exertions, in which he displayed a fortitude, a perseverance, and a practical sagacity, that have never failed to excite surprise. The power of bodily endurance would have been nothing without the infinite tact in business; skill would have fallen short of its objects without miraculous patience and perseverance; and nothing could have disarmed opposition, but that natural spring of sweetness in his disposition, which perpetually welled out in the midst of appalling labors, and converted, in many, many instances, the suspicious and intractable into sincere and zealous friends. The astonishing little animal he drove for six or eight of the first years, sometimes took the Sachem seventy miles in a day. On one occasion, he pushed her thirty miles after twilight, without stopping; having been dogged by two ruffians, in a desolate part of the country, who attempted to deprive him of his trunk. It contained, unknown to them, twenty thousand dollars of the public money. After putting them to flight, he thought it prudent to make as many tracks as possible. Her subsequent blindness he ascribed to the severe drive of that memorable evening. Her âgoing like a greyhound,â as she descended the Onondaga hollow, was described to me there, years after she was as stiff as the steeds of Rhesus.âAs a friend once said of the business letters of Mr. Astor, Every word weighs a pound; or, as the leaves of the Sybil, which, though light enough for the wind, were full of ponderous meaning,âso, reader, couldst thou peruse these flimsy verses through my spectacles, thou wouldst find in some of them more âthan meets the ear.â As an illustration of the words, âNow, o'er deep fords, by night, as day,â take the following:âAfter half a day's solitary travelling, the Sachem once came to a stream, apparently swollen with rain, to an unusual depth. It was necessary to cross it, or be frustrated of his objects, besides measuring back a weary way. He undressed himself, strapped his trunk of clothes, papers, &amp;c., on the top of his sulky, and reached the opposite bank with no other inconvenience than an unseasonable bath. âStranger, imagine not this Portrait to be a figment, or even an embellishment of the imagination. It is addressed to those who knew the man; and to those who knew him best, I appeal for its fidelity. Every line and epithet applied to him, could be substantiated by apposite anecdotes.â Though, perhaps, jam satis, I will add one more. On one of his school-fund journeys, nearly thirty years ago, traversing a forest in Ohio, which, for many a long mile, had seemed as undisturbed by human occupants as on the day of creation, there suddenly glided into the path an armed Indian. The apparition was rather startling. The Sachem nodded, however, to his compatriot, and kept jogging on, as if unconcerned. The Indian surveyed him earnestly, from time to time;âbut, whether Young Jin quickened or slackened her pace, he still kept at the wheel. After about six miles, the sulky drew up, and a four-pence-ha'penny was handed to its persevering attendant. The Redskin received it with a grunt, or nod of thanks, turned off into the woods, and was seen no more. If any evil purpose was harboured, perhaps the donor owed something, on this occasion, to those indisputable sachem marks, which distinguished both his person and aspect. I wish it had been possible, consistently with brevity, to throw in a few more of the traits, which made even his children smile at the simplicity of his feelings, while they stood amazed at his power, and adored his goodness. His memorable relations (memorable at least to his family) with the Connecticut School Fund might be summed in the quaint address of Eliot, the spiritual friend of the Indians, to Robert Boyle:ââRight honorable, charitable, indefatigable, nursing father!â The words are singularly applicable, also, to his exertions in behalf of another public interest. For fifty years he was the Treasurer of Yale College; and during the first thirty he may be said to have been the Ways and Means of the Corporation;âby which I intend, that in all their pecuniary difficulties, and in their collisions with the State, (for there were Anti-Grammaticals in those days as well as these,) their main reliance was on his commanding influence, his resource and ingenuity, and on his single-hearted attachment to their interests. In such a state of despondency was that body in 1791â2, that he was called home from Congress to advise in the threatening aspect of their affairs. His counsel was,âunreservedly to open the whole condition of the Institution to the recently appointed and very able Committee of the Legislature, (composed, however, of individuals supposed to be desirous of some changes,) and the result was, a Report favorable and honorable to the College. About this time he conceived the idea of obtaining a grant in its favor of certain outstanding taxes, the nature of which will be found explained below, in the words of the Hon. Mr. Pitkin. âBefore the establishment of the present constitution, the State of Connecticut had, at various times, laid taxes, which were payable in certain evidences of debt against the State; for the purpose of paying the interest and part of the principal of this debt. âCongress, in 1790, assumed State debts to the amount of ?21,000,000, and the amount assumed for Connecticut was ?1,600,000, and was to be funded, on certain terms, by those who held certain evidences of this debt. At the time of the assumption, a large balance of those taxes was due from the various collectors through the State, and was payable in the same evidences of State debt, as were assumed and authorized to be funded, under the act of Congress. If these balances should be paid into the State Treasury, in those evidences of debts, they must, of course, be cancelled, or considered as paid. âIn this situation, James Hillhouse, Esq., then, and long after, Treasurer of Yale College, and ever attentive and active in its pecuniary concerns, conceived the idea of having these balances transferred to that institution, and funded, under the assumption act, for its benefit. With this view, he induced an application, on the part of the College, to be made to the Legislature of the State, and he was acting manager in pursuing the application. âTo induce the Legislature to make the grant of these balances to the College, which were then unascertained, he proposed that the grant be made on the condition, that one half of the sum, which should be paid over to the College, and funded, should be transferred to the State by the Institution, for the use and benefit of the State itself. âOn these terms, Mr. Hillhouse, by his usual perseverance and untiring exertions, at last obtained the grant. He had great difficulties, and strong prejudices, to encounter, which no one but himself could have overcome. Some of the most intelligent members of the Assembly, professional men, on whom he had relied for support, deemed it an impracticable scheme, and, at first, almost refused him their aid, in attempting to carry it into effect. He then applied to another class of the Legislature, to the substantial farmers, and urged upon them the great importance of doing something for a College, which was the pride of the State, and explained to them his plan, by which not only the College, but the State itself, would be greatly benefited. He interested this class of men strongly in favor of his plan, and it was through their influence, tht the measure was finally carried through the Legislature. âThe amount of the balance of these taxes was larger than was apprehended, and the College received greater pecuniary benefit from this grant than from all others, except the late donation by individuals.â Professor Kingsley observes: âThe honor of originating this measure, and of securing its passage through the Legislature, belongs to the Treasurer, Mr. Hillhouse. No one has pretended, that, without him, any thing would have been, or could have been done, on the subject.ââ Sketch of the History of Yale College, p. 26. By unflinching zeal, he carried the measure, contrary to the hopes of many equally sincere, but less sanguine friends. This grant laid anew the corner-stone of Yale College. When he assumed his office, in 1782, one of those shadowy White Wigs, which then rendered the Corporation illustrious, said to him:ââYoung man, you are taking upon you an important trust. Remember! in the discharge of business, you must never serve the Devil;âbut you may make the Devil serve you.â Whether that venerable and honorable Body ascribe the rescue of their institution from a state of want and decay, and its exaltation to its present pitch of usefulness, to any agency less orthodox than the Divine blessing on disinterested human efforts, we have not inquired. The subject of this note, and the late illustrious President, who came into office in 1795, were co-workers and brothers, âyea, more than brothers,âin all that tended to the enduring prosperity of this favorite object of their care. But other Highwoods meet the ear, Making our home scarce ours appear. Something uncommon, something wild, Peculiar to the Forest child, Would please me more than any name To which another can lay claim.

'T were ominous;âit should not be;â It looks like turning.âHold! let 's see;â The name, I swear, I won by wit, I poached on no man,âstole not it,â 'T was branded on my rakes and hoes, Before the other Highwood rose. Yet legends say that Geoffrey Crayon, Cruising round Weehawk one play day on, (For where âauld Hornie!â has not he Spooked 'twixt the prairies and the sea?) To spook,âto saunter about inquisitively.â Nursery. There, where your eye, at once, controls Sails from the tropics and the poles, The belted city, glorious bay, And, northward, God's and Clinton's way, Down which an empire's harvests ride, For their prospective magnitude, see the interesting report of Mr. Ruggles, to the New York Legislature, during the last session.âOne's imagination can hardly advert to the North River, without thoughts of steamboats, western wheat, &amp;c.; so I leave this couplet as it is, though it rings in my ear as if I had heard its like somewhere. I cannot possibly remember. If I have stumbled upon any other person's words or thoughts, they are much at his service. And Fulton's smoking chariots glide; Christened the trees, that then peeped o'er The bastions of that haughty shore, Highwood.âPray how could I Know, or suspect a thing so sly?â And were that Highwood now the den The residence of James G. King, Esq., opposite the city of New York. Of foxes, or that kind of men, Egad! I'd hurl the name so far, It ne'er my tympanum could jar. But when we reason something higher, Observe, there, people we admire; Of proven worth, urbane, and true; Keeping the line their fathers drew; A graceful vine, a noble shoot, Each from a venerated root; Namely, from Archibald Gracie, and Rufus King. Good stock, good nurture, and a tone, I hope as Federal as mine own,â I scarcely can confess my pain, And half am tempted to refrain.â But memory's glass is at mine eye;â And shadows pass of things gone by. The Sachem's day is o'er, is o'er! His hatchet (buried oft before) His favorite toast among old friends, uttered with a beaming of the eye, which showed that no bitter reminiscence could be harboured in his heart, was,ââLet us bury the hatchet.â It embodied the spirit of his life.âIt used to be said in the Senate Chamber, that he kept one of these implements, under the papers and red tape, in his desk; which he had been known to take out and lay carelessly by the side of his inkstand, when the debate waxed personal. No bad idea, by the bye. He, at any rate, averted many a dÃ©sagrÃ©ment, by pleasantly threatening to âtake the tree.ââHis father, William Hillhouse, of Montville, who, in the days of steady habits, came up on his Narraganset pacer, and took his seat in one hundred and six Legislatures, (then semi-annual,) was a tall, spare man, as dark as the Black Douglas himself, and did not particularly fancy being hit, upon his reputed Mohegan cross. Being the Patriarch of the eastern section of the State, and with a relish of wit, he usually had a circle round him at his lodgings. On a certain occasion, the Sachem, who had often, in the State Legislature, been opposed in argument to his father, but was then a young member of Congress, happened to call on the old gentleman during the Hartford session, at a moment when he was reading with great glee to the whole mess, a squib upon the Congress Men, from a Philadelphia newspaper. It was at the time a Library was talked of for Congress. The gist of the pleasantry lay in the adaptation of a Book to the private history of each of the prominent Members. The old man read on, chuckling, for some time: at last, looking up, he said, dryly: âWhy, Jemmy, they don't notice you at all.âââRead on, father.â He did so; and soon came to the volume to be ordered for his son, namely, a History of the Aborigines, to aid him in tracing his pedigree! For a rarity, the old gentleman was floored. Venerable image of the elder day! well do I remember those stupendous shoe-buckles, that long, gold-headed cane, (kept in Madam, thy Sister's best closet, for thy sole annual use,) that steel watch-chain, and silver pendants, yea, and the streak of holland, like the slash in an antique doublet, commonly seen betwixt thy waistcoat and small clothes, as thou passedst daily, at nine o'clock, A. M., during the autumnal session! One of his little granddaughters took it into her head to watch for her dear âBlack Grandpapa,â and insist on kissing him in the street, as he passed. He condescended, once or twice, to stoop for her salute; but, anon, we missed him. He passed us no more; having adopted Church street, instead of Temple street, on his way to the Council Chamber. One of the earliest recollections of our boyhood is the appearance of that Council Chamber, as we used to peep into it. Trumbull sat facing the door,âclarum et venerabile nomen!âthere lay his awful sword and cocked hat,âand round the table, besides his Excellency and his Honor, were twelve noble-looking men, whom our juvenile eyes regarded as scarcely inferior to gods. And, compared with many, who floated up, afterwards, on the spume of party, not a man of them but was a Capitolinus. As the oldest Counsellor,âat the Governor's right hand,âsat, ever, the Patriarch of Montville, (a study for Spagnoletto,) with half his body, in addition to his legs, under the table, a huge pair of depending eyebrows, concealing all the eyes he had, till called upon for an opinion, when he lifted them up long enough to speak briefly, and then they immediately relapsed. He resigned his seat at the age of eighty, in the full possession of his mental powers. The language of the letter before me is: âHe has withdrawn from public life with cheerfulness and dignity.â He was able, at that age, to ride his Narraganset from New Haven to New London in a day, abhorring âwheel carriages.â At his leave-taking, I have been told, there was not a dry eye at the Council Board. In earnest rusts; while he has found, Far off, a choicer hunting-ground. Here, where in life's aspiring stage, He planned a wigwam for his age, Vowing the woodman's murderous steel These noble trunks should never feel; Here, where the objects of his care, Waved grateful o'er his silver hair; Here, where as silent moons roll by, We think of him beyond the sky, Resting among the Wise and Good, Our hearts decide for Sachem's-Wood. Sachem's-Wood, 30 July, 1838. THE HERMIT OF WARKWORTH, A NORTHUMBERLAND BALLAD. CANTO I. Dark was the night, and wild the storm, And loud the torrent's roar; And loud the sea was heard to dash Against the distant shore. Musing on man's weak, hapless state, The lonely Hermit lay; When, lo! he heard a female voice Lament in sore dismay. With hospitable haste he rose, And waked his sleeping fire; And snatching up a lighted brand, Forth hied the reverend sire. All sad beneath a neighbouring tree A beauteous maid he found, Who beat her breast, and with her tears Bedewed the mossy ground. âO weep not, lady, weep not so, Nor let vain fears alarm; My little cell shall shelter thee, And keep thee safe from harm.â âIt is not for myself I weep, Nor for myself I fear; But for my dear and only friend, Who lately left me here: âAnd while some sheltering bower he sought Within this lonely wood, Ah! sore I fear his wandering feet Have slipt in yonder flood.â âO! trust in Heaven,â the Hermit said, âAnd to my cell repair; Doubt not but I shall find thy friend, And ease thee of thy care.â Then climbing up his rocky stairs, He scales the cliff so high; And calls aloud, and waves his light, To guide the stranger's eye. Among the thickets long he winds, With careful steps and slow: At length a voice returned his call, Quick answering from below: âO tell me, father, tell me true, If you have chanced to see A gentle maid, I lately left Beneath some neighbouring tree: âBut either I have lost the place, Or she hath gone astray; And much I fear this fatal stream Hath snatched her hence away.â âPraise Heaven, my son,â the Hermit said; âThe lady 's safe and well;â And soon he joined the wandering youth, And brought him to his cell. Then well was seen, these gentle friends They loved each other dear: The youth he pressed her to his heart; The maid let fall a tear. Ah! seldom had their host, I ween, Beheld so sweet a pair: The youth was tall, with manly bloom; She, slender, soft, and fair. The youth was clad in forest green, With bugle-horn so bright: She in a silken robe and scarf, Snatched up in hasty flight. âSit down, my children.â says the Sage; âSweet rest your limbs require;â Then heaps fresh fuel on the hearth, And mends his little fire. âPartake,â he said, âmy simple store, Dried fruits, and milk, and curds;â And spreading all upon the board, Invites with kindly words. âThanks, father, for thy bounteous fare,â The youthful couple say: Then freely ate, and made good cheer, And talked their cares away. âNow, say, my children, (for perchance My counsel may avail,) What strange adventure brought you here, Within this lonely dale?â âFirst tell me, father,â said the youth, â(Nor blame mine eager tongue,) What town is near? What lands are these? And to what lord belong?â âAlas! my son,â the Hermit said, âWhy do I live to say, The rightful lord of these domains Is banished far away? âTen winters now have shed their snows On this my lowly hall, Since valiant Hotspur (so the North Our youthful lord did call) âAgainst Fourth Henry Bolingbroke Led up his northern powers, And, stoutly fighting, lost his life Near proud Salopia's towers. âOne son he left, a lovely boy, His country's hope and heir; And, oh! to save him from his foes It was his grandsire's care, âIn Scotland safe he placed the child Beyond the reach of strife, Nor long before the brave old Earl At Bramham lost his life. âAnd now the Percy name, so long Our northern pride and boast, Lies hid, alas! beneath a cloud; Their honors reft and lost. âNo chieftain of that noble house Now leads our youth to arms; The bordering Scots despoil our fields, And ravage all our farms. âTheir halls and castles, once so fair, Now moulder in decay; Proud strangers now usurp their lands, And bear their wealth away. âNor far from hence, where yon full stream Runs winding down the lea, Fair Warkworth lifts her lofty towers, And overlooks the sea. âThose towers, alas! now stand forlorn, With noisome weeds o'erspread, Where feasted lords and courtly dames, And where the poor were fed. âMeantime, far off, 'mid Scottish hills, The Percy lives unknown; On strangers' bounty he depends, And may not claim his own. âO might I with these aged eyes But live to see him here, Then should my soul depart in bliss!â He said, and dropt a tear. âAnd is the Percy still so loved Of all his friends and thee? Then bless me, father,â said the youth, âFor I, thy guest, am he.â Silent he gazed, then turned aside To wipe the tears he shed; And lifting up his hands and eyes, Poured blessings on his head: âWelcome, our dear and much-loved lord, Thy country's hope and care:â But who may this young lady be, That is so wondrous fair?â âNow, father, listen to my tale, And thou shalt know the truth: And let thy sage advice direct My unexperienced youth. âIn Scotland I 've been nobly bred, Beneath the Regent's hand, Robert Stuart, Duke of Albany. See the continuator of Fordun's Scoti-Chronicon, cap. 18, cap. 23, &amp;c. In feats of arms, and every lore, To fit me for command. âWith fond impatience long I burned My native land to see: At length I won my guardian friend, To yield that boon to me. âThen up and down, in hunter's garb, I wandered as in chase, Till in the noble Neville's Ralph Neville, first Earl of Westmoreland, whose principal residence was at Raby Castle, in the Bishopric of Durham. house I gained a hunter's place. âSome time I lived with him unknown, Till I'd the hap so rare, To please this young and gentle dame, That Baron's daughter fair.â âNow, Percy,â said the blushing maid, âThe truth I must reveal; Souls great and generous, like to thine, Their noble deeds conceal. âIt happened on a summer's day, Led by the fragrant breeze, I wandered forth to take the air Among the green-wood trees. âSudden a band of rugged Scots, That near in ambush lay, Moss-troopers from the border-side, There seized me for their prey. âMy shrieks had all been spent in vain, But Heaven, that saw my grief, Brought this brave youth within my call, Who flew to my relief. âWith nothing but his hunting-spear And dagger in his hand, He sprung like lightning on my foes, And caused them soon to stand. âHe fought, till more assistance came; The Scots were overthrown; Thus freed me, captive, from their bands, To make me more his own.â âO, happy day!â the youth replied: âBlest were the wounds I bare! From that fond hour she deigned to smile, And listen to my prayer. âAnd when she knew my name and birth, She vowed to be my bride; But oh! we feared (alas, the while!) Her princely mother's pride: âSister of haughty Bolingbroke, Our house's ancient foe, To me, I thought, a banished wight, Could ne'er such favor show. âDespairing then to gain consent, At length to fly with me I won this lovely, timorous maid; To Scotland bound are we. âThis evening, as the night drew on, Fearing we were pursued, We turned adown the right-hand path, And gained this lonely wood: âThen lighting from our weary steeds To shun the pelting shower, We met thy kind conducting hand, And reached this friendly bower.â âNow rest ye both,â the Hermit said; âAwhile your cares forego; Nor, lady, scorn my humble bed; âWe'll pass the night below.â Adjoining to the cliff, which contains the Chapel of the Hermitage, are the remains of a small building, in which the Hermit dwelt. This consisted of one lower apartment, with a little bed-chamber over it, and is now in ruins: whereas the Chapel, cut in the solid rock, is still very entire and perfect. CANTO II. Lovely smiled the blushing morn, And every storm was fled; But lovelier far, with sweeter smile, Fair Eleanor left her bed. She found her Henry all alone, And cheered him with her sight: The youth consulting with his friend Had watched the livelong night. What sweet surprise o'erpowered her breast! Her cheek what blushes dyed, When fondly he besought her there To yield to be his bride!â âWithin this lonely hermitage There is a chapel meet; Then grant, dear maid, my fond request, And make my bliss complete.â âO Henry, when thou deign'st to sue, Can I thy suit withstand? When thou, loved youth, hast won my heart, Can I refuse my hand? âFor thee I left a father's smiles, And mother's tender care; And, whether weal or woe betide, Thy lot I mean to share.â âAnd wilt thou, then, O generous maid! Such matchless favor show, To share with me, a banished wight, My peril, pain, or woe? âNow Heaven, I trust, hath joys in store To crown thy constant breast; For, know, fond hope assures my heart That we shall soon be blest. âNot far from hence stands Coquet Isle, Surrounded by the sea; There dwells a holy friar, well known To all thy friends and thee: In the little island of Coquet, near Warkworth, are still seen the ruins of a Cell, which belonged to the Benedictine Monks of Tinemouth Abbey. â'T is father Bernard, so revered For every worthy deed; To Raby Castle he shall go, And for us kindly plead. âTo fetch this good and holy man Our reverend host is gone; And soon, I trust, his pious hands Will join us both in one.â Thus they in sweet and tender talk The lingering hours beguile: At length they see the hoary sage Come from the neighbouring isle. With pious joy and wonder mixed He greets the noble pair, And glad consents to join their hands With many a fervent prayer. Then straight to Raby's distant walls He kindly wends his way; Meantime in love and dalliance sweet They spend the livelong day. And now, attended by their host, The Hermitage they viewed, Deep-hewn within a craggy cliff, And overhung with wood. And, near, a flight of shapely steps, All cut with nicest skill, And piercing through a stony arch, Ran winding up the hill. There, decked with many a flower and herb, His little garden stands; With fruitful trees, in shady rows, All planted by his hands. Then, scooped within the solid rock, Three sacred vaults he shows: The chief a chapel, neatly arched, On branching columns rose. Each proper ornament was there That should a chapel grace; The lattice for confession framed, And Holy-water vase. O'er either door a sacred text Invites to godly fear; And in a little scutcheon hung The cross, and crown, and spear. Up to the altar's ample breadth Two easy steps ascend; And, near, a glimmering, solemn light Two well-wrought windows lend. Beside the altar rose a tomb All in the living stone; On which a young and beauteous maid In goodly sculpture shone. A kneeling angel, fairly carved, Leaned hovering o'er her breast: A weeping warrior at her feet: And near to these her crest. This is a Bull's Head, the crest of the Widdrington family. All the figures, &amp;c., here described, are still visible; only somewhat effaced with length of time. The cliff, the vault, but chief the tomb, Attract the wondering pair: Eager they ask, what hapless dame Lies sculptured here so fair. The Hermit sighed, the Hermit wept, For sorrow scarce could speak: At length he wiped the trickling tears That all bedewed his cheek: âAlas! my children, human life Is but a vale of woe; And very mournful is the tale Which ye so fain would know.â. THE HERMIT'S TALE. âYoung lord, thy grandsire had a friend In days of youthful fame; Yon distant hills were his domains, Sir Bertram was his name. âWhere'er the noble Percy fought, His friend was at his side; And many a skirmish with the Scots Their early valor tried. âYoung Bertram loved a beauteous maid, As fair as fair might be; The dewdrop on the lily's cheek Was not so fair as she. âFair Widdrington the maiden's name, Yon towers her dwelling-place; Widdrington Castle is about five miles south of Warkworth. Her sire an old Northumbrian chief, Devoted to thy race. âMany a lord and many a knight To this fair damsel came; But Bertram was her only choice; For him she felt a flame. âLord Percy pleaded for his friend, Her father soon consents; None but the beauteous maid herself His wishes now prevents. âBut she with studied, fond delays Defers the blissful hour; And loves to try his constancy, And prove her maiden power. ââThat heart,â she said, âis lightly prized, Which is too lightly won; And long shall rue that easy maid, Who yields her love too soon.â âLord Percy made a solemn feast In Alnwick's princely hall; And there came lords, and there came knights, His Chiefs and Barons all. âWith wassel, mirth, and revelry, The Castle rung around; Lord Percy called for song and harp, And pipes of martial sound. âThe minstrels of thy noble house, All clad in robes of blue, With silver crescents on their arms, Attend in order due. âThe great achievements of thy race They sung: their high command: How valiant Mainfred o'er the seas First led his northern band. See Dugdale's Baronage, &amp;c. âBrave Galfred next to Normandy With venturous Rollo came; And, from his Norman Castles won, Assumed the Percy name. In Lower Normandy are three places of the name of Percy: whence the family took the surname of De Percy. âThey sung how, in the Conqueror's fleet, Lord William shipped his powers, And gained a fair young Saxon bride, With all her lands and towers. William de Percy, (fifth in descent from Galfred, or Geffrey de Percy, son of Mainfred,) assisted in the conquest of England, and had given him the large possessions in Yorkshire, of Emma de Porte, (so the Norman writers name her,) whose father, a great Saxon lord, had been slain fighting along with Harold. This young lady, William, from a principle of honor and generosity, married: for, having had all her lands bestowed upon him by the Conqueror, âhe (to use the words of the old Whitby Chronicle) wedded hyr that was very heire to them in discharging of his conscience.â See Harl. MSS. 692. (26.) He died in Asia, in the first Crusade. âThen journeying to the Holy Land, There bravely fought and died: But first the silver Crescent won, Some Paynim Soldan's pride. âThey sung how Agnes, beauteous heir, The Queen's own brother wed, Lord Josceline, sprung from Charlemagne, In princely Brabant bred. Agnes de Percy, sole heiress of her house, married Josceline de Lovain, youngest son of Godfrey Barbatus, Duke of Brabant, and brother of Queen Adeliza, second wife of King Henry the First. He took the name of Percy, and was ancestor of the Earls of Northumberland. His son, Lord Richard de Percy, was one of the twenty-five Barons, chosen to see the Magna Charta duly observed. âHow he the Percy name revived, And how his noble line, Still foremost in their country's cause, With godlike ardor shine. âWith loud acclaims the listening crowd Applaud the master's song, And deeds of arms and war became The theme of every tongue. âNow high heroic acts they tell, Their perils past recall: When lo! a damsel young and fair Stepped forward through the hall. âShe Bertram courteously addressed; And kneeling on her knee;â âSir Knight, the Lady of thy love Hath sent this gift to thee.â âThen forth she drew a glittering helm Well-plated many a fold, The casque was wrought of tempered steel, The crest of burnished gold. ââSir Knight, thy Lady sends thee this, And yields to be thy bride, When thou hast proved this maiden gift Where sharpest blows are tried.â âYoung Bertram took the shining helm, And thrice he kissed the same; âTrust me, I'll prove this precious casque With deeds of noblest fame.â âLord Percy, and his Barons bold, Then fix upon a day To scour the marches, late oppressed, And Scottish wrongs repay. âThe knights assembled on the hills, A thousand horse and more; Brave Widdrington, though sunk in years, The Percy standard bore. âTweed's limpid current soon they pass, And range the borders round: Down the green slopes of Tiviotdale Their bugle-horns resound. âAs when a lion in his den Hath heard the hunters' cries, And rushes forth to meet his foes, So did the Douglas rise. âAttendant on their Chief's command A thousand warriors wait: And now the fatal hour drew on Of cruel, keen debate. âA chosen troop of Scottish youths Advance before the rest; Lord Percy marked their gallant mien, And thus his friend addressed: ââNow, Bertram, prove thy Lady's helm, Attack yon forward band; Dead or alive I'll rescue thee, Or perish by their hand.â âYoung Bertram bowed, with glad assent, And spurred his eager steed, And, calling on his Lady's name, Rushed forth with whirlwind speed. âAs when a grove of sapling oaks The livid lightning rends; So fiercely 'mid opposing ranks Sir Bertram's sword descends. âThis way and that he drives the steel, And keenly pierces through; And many a tall and comely knight With furious force he slew. âNow closing fast on every side, They hem Sir Bertram round: But dauntless he repels their rage, And deals forth many a wound. âThe vigor of his single arm Had well-nigh won the field; When pond'rous fell a Scottish axe, And clave his lifted shield. âAnother blow his temples took, And reft his helm in twain; That beauteous helm, his Lady's gift! âHis blood bedewed the plain. âLord Percy saw his champion fall, Amid the unequal fight; âAnd now, my noble friends, he said, Let 's save this gallant knight.â âThen rushing in, with stretched-out shield He o'er the warrior hung: As some fierce eagle spreads her wing To guard her callow young. âThree times they strove to seize their prey, Three times they quick retire: What force could stand his furious strokes, Or meet his martial fire? âNow gathering round on every part The battle raged amain; And many a Lady wept her Lord, That hour untimely slain. âPercy and Douglas, great in arms, There all their courage showed; And all the field was strewed with dead, And all with crimson flowed. âAt length the glory of the day The Scots reluctant yield, And, after wond'rous valor shown, They slowly quit the field. âAll pale, extended on their shields, And weltering in his gore, Lord Percy's knights their bleeding friend To Wark's fair Castle bore. Wark Castle, a fortress belonging to the English, and of great note in ancient times, stood on the southern bank of the river Tweed, a little to the east of Tiviotdale, and not far from Kelso. It is now entirely destroyed. ââWell hast thou earned my daughter's love,â Her father kindly said; âAnd she herself shall dress thy wounds, And tend thee in thy bed.â âA message went, no daughter came; Fair Isabel ne'er appears: âBeshrew me,â said the aged chief, âYoung maidens have their fears. ââCheer up, my son, thou shalt her see So soon as thou canst ride; And she shall nurse thee in her bower, And she shall be thy bride.â âSir Bertram at her name revived, He blessed the soothing sound; Fond hope supplied the nurse's care, And healed his ghastly wound. CANTO III. âOne early morn, while dewy drops Hung trembling on the tree, Sir Bertram from his sick-bed rose, His bride he would go see. âA brother he had, in prime of youth, Of courage firm and keen; And he would tend him on the way, Because his wounds were green. âAll day o'er moss and moor they rode, By many a lonely tower; And 't was the dew-fall of the night Ere they drew near her bower. âMost drear and dark the Castle seemed, That wont to shine so bright; And long and loud Sir Bertram called, Ere he beheld a light. âAt length her aged nurse arose With voice so shrill and clear: âWhat wight is this, that calls so loud, And knocks so boldly here?â ââ'T is Bertram calls, thy Lady's love, Come from his bed of care: All day I 've ridden o'er moor and moss To see thy Lady fair.â ââNow out, alas!â she loudly shrieked, âAlas! how may this be? For six long days are gone and past Since she set out to thee.â âSad terror seized Sir Bertram's heart, And oft he deeply sighed; When now the drawbridge was let down, And gates set open wide. ââSix days, young knight, are past and gone Since she set out to thee; And sure, if no sad harm had happed, Long since thou wouldst her see. ââFor, when she heard thy grievous chance, She tore her hair, and cried, Alas! I 've slain the comeliest knight, All through my folly and pride! ââAnd now to atone for my sad fault, And his dear health regain, I'll go myself, and nurse my love, And soothe his bed of pain. ââThen mounted she her milk-white steed One morn at break of day; And two tall yeomen went with her, To guard her on the way.â âSad terror smote Sir Bertram's heart, And grief o'erwhelmed his mind: âTrust me,â said he, âI ne'er will rest Till I thy Lady find.â âThat night he spent in sorrow and care; And with sad-boding heart, Or ever the dawning of the day, His brother and he depart. ââNow, brother, we'll our ways divide, O'er Scottish hills to range; Do thou go north, and I'll go west; And all our dress we'll change. ââSome Scottish carle hath seized my love, And bore her to his den; And ne'er will I tread English ground Till she is restored agen.â âThe brothers straight their paths divide, O'er Scottish hills to range; And hide themselves in quaint disguise, And oft their dress they change. âSir Bertram, clad in gown of gray, Most like a palmer poor, To halls and castles wanders round, And begs from door to door. âSometimes a minstrel's garb he wears, With pipes so sweet and shrill; And wends to every tower and town, O'er every dale and hill. âOne day as he sate under a thorn All sunk in deep despair, An aged pilgrim passed him by, Who marked his face of care. ââAll minstrels yet that ever I saw, Are full of game and glee; But thou art sad and woe-begone! I marvel whence it be!â ââFather, I serve an aged Lord, Whose grief afflicts my mind; His only child is stolen away, And fain I would her find.â ââCheer up, my son; perchance, (he said,) Some tidings I may bear; For oft when human hopes have failed, Then heavenly comfort's near. ââBehind yon hills so steep and high, Down in the lowly glen, There stands a Castle fair and strong, Far from the abode of men. ââAs late I chanced to crave an alms About this evening hour, Methought I heard a Lady's voice Lamenting in the tower. ââAnd when I asked what harm had happed, What Lady sick there lay, They rudely drove me from the gate, And bade me wend away.â âThese tidings caught Sir Bertram's ear, He thanked him for his tale; And soon he hasted o'er the hills, And soon he reached the vale. âThen drawing near those lonely towers, Which stood in dale so low, And sitting down beside the gate, His pipes he 'gan to blow. ââSir Porter, is thy lord at home To hear a minstrel's song? Or may I crave a lodging here, Without offence or wrong?â ââMy lord,â he said, âis not at home To hear a minstrel's song: And, should I lend thee lodging here, My life would not be long.â âHe played again so soft a strain, Such power sweet sounds impart, He won the churlish Porter's ear, And moved his stubborn heart. ââMinstrel, (he said,) thou play'st so sweet, Fair entrance thou shouldst win; But, alas, I'm sworn upon the rood To let no stranger in. ââYet, minstrel, in yon rising cliff Thou 'lt find a sheltering cave; And here thou shalt my supper share, And there thy lodging have.â âAll day he sits beside the gate, And pipes both loud and clear: All night he watches round the walls, In hopes his love to hear. âThe first night, as he silent watched, All at the midnight hour, He plainly heard his Lady's voice Lamenting in the tower. âThe second night the moon shone clear, And gilt the spangled dew; He saw his Lady through the grate, But 't was a transient view. âThe third night, wearied out, he slept Till near the morning tide; When, starting up, he seized his sword, And to the Castle hied. âWhen, lo! he saw a ladder of ropes Depending from the wall; And o'er the moat was newly laid A poplar, strong and tall. âAnd soon he saw his love descend Wrapt in a tartan plaid; Assisted by a sturdy youth In Highland garb y-clad. âAmazed, confounded at the sight, He lay unseen and still; And soon he saw them cross the stream, And mount the neighbouring hill. âUnheard, unknown of all within, The youthful couple fly. But what can 'scape the lover's ken? Or shun his piercing eye? âWith silent steps he follows close Behind the flying pair, And saw her hang upon his arm, With fond, familiar air. ââThanks, gentle youth,â she often said; âMy thanks thou well hast won: For me what wiles hast thou contrived! For me what dangers run! ââAnd ever shall my grateful heart Thy services repay:ââ Sir Bertram could no further hear, But cried, âVile traitor, stay! ââVile traitor, yield that lady up!ââ And quick his sword he drew. The stranger turned in sudden rage, And at Sir Bertram flew. âWith mortal hate their vigorous arms Gave many a vengeful blow: But Bertram's stronger hand prevailed, And laid the stranger low. ââDie, traitor, die!ââA deadly thrust Attends each furious word. Ah! then fair Isabel knew his voice, And rushed beneath his sword. ââO stop,â she cried, âO stop thy arm! Thou dost thy brother slay!âââ And here the Hermit paused and wept: His tongue no more could say. At length he cried, âYe lovely pair, How shall I tell the rest? Ere I could stop my piercing sword, It fell, and stabbed her breast.â âWert thou thyself that hapless youth? Ah! cruel! fate!â they said. The Hermit wept, and so did they: They sighed; he hung his head. âO blind and jealous rage,â he cried, âWhat evils from thee flow?â The Hermit paused; they silent mourned: He wept, and they were woe. âAh! when I heard my brother's name, And saw my Lady bleed, I raved, I wept, I curst my arm, That wrought the fatal deed. âIn vain I clasped her to my breast, And closed the ghastly wound; In vain I pressed his bleeding corpse, And raised it from the ground. âMy brother, alas! spake never more, His precious life was flown. She kindly strove to soothe my pain, Regardless of her own. ââBertram,â she said, âbe comforted, And live to think on me: May we in heaven that union prove, Which here was not to be! ââBertram,â she said, âI still was true; Thou only hadst my heart: May we hereafter meet in bliss! We now, alas! must part. ââFor thee, I left my father's hall, And flew to thy relief, When, lo! near Cheviot's fatal hills, I met a Scottish chief, ââLord Malcolm's son, whose proffered love, I had refused with scorn; He slew my guards, and seized on me, Upon that fatal morn: ââAnd in these dreary, hated walls He kept me close confined; And fondly sued, and warmly pressed, To win me to his mind. ââEach rising morn increased my pain, Each night increased my fear! When, wandering in this northern garb, Thy brother found me here. ââHe quickly formed this brave design To set me captive free; And on the moor his horses wait, Tied to a neighbouring tree. ââThen haste, my love, escape away, And for thyself provide; And sometimes fondly think on her Who should have been thy bride!â âThus pouring comfort on my soul, Even with her latest breath, She gave one parting, fond embrace, And closed her eyes in death. âIn wild amaze, in speechless woe, Devoid of sense I lay: Then sudden all in frantic mood I meant myself to slay: âAnd, rising up in furious haste, I seized the bloody brand: i. e. sword. A sturdy arm here interposed, And wrenched it from my hand. âA crowd that from the Castle came, Had missed their lovely ward; And seizing me, to prison bare, And deep in dungeon barred. âIt chanced, that on that very morn Their chief was prisoner ta'en: Lord Percy had us soon exchanged, And strove to soothe my pain. âAnd soon those honored, dear remains To England were conveyed; And there within their silent tombs, With holy rites, were laid. âFor me, I loathed my wretched life, And oft to end it sought; Till time, and thought, and holy men Had better counsels taught. âThey raised my heart to that pure source, Whence heavenly comfort flows: They taught me to despise the world, And calmly bear its woes. âNo more the slave of human pride, Vain hope, and sordid care, I meekly vowed to spend my life In penitence and prayer. âThe bold Sir Bertram now no more, Impetuous, haughty, wild; But poor and humble Benedict, Now lowly, patient, mild: âMy lands I gave to feed the poor, And sacred altars raise; And here, a lonely anchorite, I came to end my days. âThis sweet, sequestered vale I chose, These rocks, and hanging grove; For oft beside this murmuring stream My love was wont to rove. âMy noble friend approved my choice; This blest retreat he gave: And here I carved her beauteous form, And scooped this holy cave. âFull fifty winters, all forlorn, My life I 've lingered here; And daily o'er this sculptured saint I drop the pensive tear. âAnd thou, dear brother of my heart! So faithful and so true, The sad remembrance of thy fate Still makes my bosom rue! âYet not unpitied passed my life, Forsaken or forgot; The Percy and his noble Son, Would grace my lowly cot. âOft the great Earl, from toils of state And cumbrous pomp of power, Would gladly seek my little cell, To spend the tranquil hour. âBut length of life is length of woe! I lived to mourn his fall: I lived to mourn his godlike Son, Hotspur. Their friends and followers all. âBut thou the honors of thy race, Loved youth, shalt now restore: And raise again the Percy name More glorious than before.â He ceased, and on the lovely pair His choicest blessings laid; While they with thanks and pitying tears His mournful tale repaid. And now what present course to take They ask the good old sire; And, guided by his sage advice, To Scotland they retire. Meantime their suit such favor found At Raby's stately hall, Earl Neville and his princely spouse Now gladly pardon all. She suppliant at her nephew's King Henry the Fifth, A. D. 1414. throne The royal grace implored: To all the honors of his race The Percy was restored. The youthful Earl still more and more Admired his beauteous dame: Nine noble sons to him she bore, All worthy of their name. The account given in the foregoing Ballad of young Percy, the son of Hotspur, receives the following confirmation from the old Chronicle of Whitby: âHenry Percy, the son of Sir Henry Percy, that was slayne at Shrewesbery, and of Elizabeth, the daughter of the Erle of Marche, after the death of his father and grauntsyre, was exild into Scotland i. e. remained an exile in Scotland during the reign of King Henry the Fourth. In ScotiÃ¢ exulavit tempore Henrici Regis Quarti. Lat. MSS. penes Duc. North. in the time of King Henry the Fourth: but in the time of King Henry the Fifth, by the labour of Johanne the Countes of Westmerland, (whose daughter Alianor he had wedded in coming into England,) he recovered the King's grace, and the countye of Northumberland, so was the second Erle of Northumberland. âAnd of this Alianor his wife, he begat IX Sonnes and III Daughters, whose names be Johanne, that is buried at Whytbye; Thomas, Lord Egremont; Katheryne Gray of Rythin; Sir Raffe Percy; William Percy, a Bishopp; Richard Percy; John, that dyed without issue; [another John, called by Vincent, See his Great Baronage, No. 20, in the Herald's office. Johannes Percy senior de Warkworth;] George Percy, Clerk; Henry that dyed without issue; Anne;ââ[besides the eldest son and successor here omitted, because he comes in below, viz.] âHenry Percy, the third Erle of Northumberland.â Vid.
