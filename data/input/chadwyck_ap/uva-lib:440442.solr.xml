      <field name="fulltext">To Beauty, Friendship, and Love Oh! Beauty! bright rose of the world! Oh, Love! the soul's myrtle for ever! Oh, Friendship! fair vine round a breaking heart curled, Without whose soft bonds it would sever! For you a rich garland we braid, Breathing sighs of pure incense above;â It will bloom in the sun, it will smile in the shade, For Beauty, for Friendship, and Love! ASSIGNATION. PIMPERNEL. Our bonny Kate bound her golden hair, With a violet wreath for the village-fair, And tripped with the grace of a gay gazelle, Where blushes the delicate pimpernel; For a prophetess true is that lowly flower, She warns us ever of tempest hour, When the rain-cloud shadows her humble head, She folds her petals of brilliant red, And keeps her sunny heart warm within, Like a fair girl shutting out grief and sin. ASYLUMâPROTECTION. JUNIPER. Ah no! never deem her less worthy of love, That once she has trusted and trusted in vain, Would you turn from the timid and innocent dove If it flew to your breast from a savage's chain? She too is a dove in her guileless affection, A child in confiding and worshipping truth, Half broken in heart she has flown for protection To you!âWill you blight the sweet promise of youth? BEAUTY COMBINED WITH PIETY. WATER-STAR. As lightly floats the water-star, And gems the limpid stream, Thy graceful, radiant loveliness, A star of earth doth beam! As 'neath the wave its seeds are nursed, For future bloom above, Within thy soul, thou cherishest Hope, meekness, faith, and love: And like the germ, that soul shall rise, When earth's cold bonds are riven, Inhale the light in cloudless skies, And bloomâa star of heaven! BONDS OF LOVE. HONEYSUCKLE. Fragile but sweet is the woodbine wild, Clinging wherever its beauty may rest, Fair as the woodbine, as trusting and mild, Oh! be thy home upon Love's fond breast! BEAUTY. ROSE. Her cheek was very eloquent; In passion, pride, or shame, Like summer's warmest lightning flash, The colour to it came;â In joyâswift smiles and dimples broke Upon its pure repose, Like sunshine and a zephyr, At play upon a rose. BEAUTY EVER NEW. CHINA, OR MONTHLY ROSE. An angel face! its sunny âwealth of hair,â In radiant ripples, bathed the graceful throat And dimpled shoulders;âround the rosy curve Of the sweet mouth a smile seemed wandering ever, While in the depths of azure fire, that gleamed Beneath the drooping lashes, slept a world Of eloquent meaningâpassionate but pure, Dreamy, subdued, but oh! how beautiful! CHASTITY. ORANGE FLOWER. How fair the orange-bloom will smile, Amid that auburn braid! How soft will burn thy blush the while, Beneath the bridal shade! Thou 'rt young to wed!âthat virgin flower, White as thine own pure brow, Just stolen from its dewy bower, Is not more fresh than thou. Thou 'rt young to wear the bridal-bloom, Yet go! for in thy heart, A lovelier blossom lights the gloom, That timid fears impart.â The heaven-fed flower of Purity;â Oh! nurse the snowdrop still! And in its breath, a charm shall be, To guard thee from all ill. CONSOLATION. SNOWDROP. Though cold Fate has lowered And darkened my day; Though sorrow has showered Her tears o'er my way; One blossom has flowered, In Love's sunny ray. Let Fate then bereave me, Let other friends flee, If my snowdrop she leave me, Pure, smiling, and free, No more can she grieve meâ My hope is in thee! CONSTANCY. BLUE CANTERBURY-BELL. Through the fragrant grove of olives, with a dark-eyed child of Spain, I have often whiled the hours, since I crossed the moaning main; But the soul in those soft, brilliant eyes, the low, melodious tone, Bade mournful thoughts of thee arise, my beautiful, my own! 'Mid the vines of sunny France, love, I have twined the silken curl, And met the merry kisses, of a light and laughing girl. And richly waved the glittering tress, and wildly woke her glee!â I pined the more for thy caressâmore fondly thought of thee! A haughty, high-born English maid, oft shares, with me, the dance;â Italia's daughter bends on me, her full, impassioned glance;â Nor graceful mienânor dimpled bloomânor look of loving light, Can win this faithful soul from thee, my purest, and most bright! COME DOWN TO ME. JACOB'S LADDER. Look! how the stars like jewels glisten, Maiden, more pure than gem or star! Lean from thy lattice, my love, and listen, While I awake my wild guitar. See! I have flung a fair flower to thee, May not its name my fond hope tell? Oh! for thy lover, let it woo thee! And ask thy blush what it means, âma belle!â Last night, the patriarch's dream was mine;â An Angel came from heaven to me;â Its smileâits tressesâwere so like thine, I think it could have been none but thee! Then realize, love, that radiant dream, Fly from thy tyrant's savage pride! Descendâoh! seraph! by night's dim beam, And morn shall hail, with a smile, my bride! CRUELTY. NETTLE. More cruel far than murder's self is he, Who, having kindled once love's Eden-bloom, With warm Persuasion's spell, in some young heart, E'er lets Indifference blight it or Neglect;â For Loveâtrue Love can flower but once in life, In woman's lifeâthe Aloe of her heart! DELICACY. BLUE-BOTTLE CENTAURY. Her love is pure and glad and true, As yonder heaven of stainless blue. Your amiability, and the excellence of your character, have compelled me to declare my love. 'T was not the glossy, golden flow Of tresses richly braided, 'T was not the dimpled rose below, Whose soul-fed smile they shaded! Those dark-fringed eyes of brilliant blue, Whose glances talk in light, love, Thy fragrant lips' deep, carmine hue, Thy hand so soft and slight, love; It was not theseâthough these excel, In thee, all others' beauty;â It was not these, that wove the spell, And won my love and duty. Thy heart is like the Jasmine-bell, It yields its wealth of feeling; Like perfume from the blossom's cell, On every zephyr stealing. Thy mind is like the Strawberry vine, In all its bright gradations;â The flowersâits graceful fancies shine, The fruitâits sweet creations! I've twined with these a Tulip rich, Within whose heart of fire, Thou'lt read a deep, warm passion, which Can never change or tire! DECLARATION OF LOVE. TULIP. Yes! by those eyes of azure glory, Shedding their star-like smiles on me; Yes! by that cheek, changing and glowing, Warm as the plumage of yon bright lory, By those ringlets so richly flowing, Dearest, I love but thee! Yes! by that foot of fairy fleetness, Springing ever so light and free, By that figure's gazelle-like grace, love, By thy spirit's pure truth and sweetness, By all thy magic of mind and face, love, Ever I love but thee! DECEITFUL CHARMS. THORN-APPLE. Heed not her sigh! 'Tis Falsehood's breath: Trust not her eye! Belief is death. A serpent's coil, Thy strength may burst: No power can foil Her snares accurst DISDAIN. YELLOW CARNATION. In the flash of her glances, were passion and pride, In the curve of her lip, there was haughty contempt, As she spoke of the power to riches allied, Of the evil and pain from which she was exempt. DISGUISE. COMMON STRAMONIUM. Ah! gay to you my smile may seem: 'tis but the lightning brief That flashes from a darkened soul through gathering clouds of grief. DISGUISE. COMMON STRAMONIUM. Though dark the heart that throbs beneath The cestus in despair;â What matters it?âthe jewel-wreath Can hide the ruin there! And oh! though still my diamonds blaze Above a spirit lonely, The worldâthe heartless worldâwill gaze, And see my jewels only! Yes! I would have them deem me blest; And wealth, at least, may be A glittering veil for broken rest And endless misery! DO ME JUSTICE. CHESTNUT-TREE. Within the oyster's shell uncouth, The purest pearl may bide;â Trust meâyou'll find a heart of truth Beneath that rough outside! DURABILITY. CORNELIAN CHERRY-TREE. Lady! my love for thee Is like the cornel-tree;â Once taken root, though slow, its growth is sure. It is no passion-flower, Lasting one summer-hour;â While my heart livesâthat feeling will endure. ELEGANCE. ACACIA ROSE. The world has won herâshe has learned Its measured smile and tread; The foot that once the snowflake spurned By courtly rule is led; And Fashion's hand has smoothed the fold Of that luxuriant hair, Where once the tress of glossy gold Waved wildly on the air. ELEGANCE. ACACIA ROSE. Her matchless wealth of beauty beggars all Our courtly dames can boast;âher queenly form, Her majesty of mien, would grace a throne. ENCHANTMENT. VERVAIN. Love is the subtlest enchanter, that ever Waved a wand or muttered a spell; A magical rod is each dart in his quiver, The heart's hidden treasures to find and tell. ENTERTAINMENTâFEASTING. PARSLEY. We may roam through this world like a child at a feast, Who but sips of a sweet, and then flies to the rest; And when pleasure begins to grow dull in the East, We may order our wings and be off to the West; FAREWELL. MICHAELMAS DAISY. I heard thy low-whispered farewell, love, And silently saw thee depart;â Ay, silent;âfor how could words tell, love, The sorrow that swelled in my heart? They could notâoh! language is faint, When Passion's devotion would speak; Light pleasure or pain it may paint, But with feelings like ours it is weak! Yet tearless and mute though I stood, love, Thy last words are thrilling me yet, And my heart would have breathed, if it could, love, And murmured: âOh! do not forget!â FALSEHOOD MANCHINEEL-TREE. If eyes like thine can falsely shine, I'll cease to look for truth on earth; If lips so sweet can breathe deceit, Ne'er trust I more to woman's worth. FANCY'S FIRE. NIGHT-BLOWING CEREUS. O'er a blossom of Thought gay Fancy plays, And lights, with her smile, its leaves; Till they gleam with a myriad teinted rays, As the sun, in a diamond, weaves His braid of resplendent rainbow bloom, That changes and glows, like a fairy's plume. FASCINATION. CIRCÃA, OR, ENCHANTER'S NIGHTSHADE. You'll speed your conquering way I trow, Through hearts, however narrow; Those lips are Cupid's graceful bow, That smile his sunlit arrow; FLAME. YELLOW-IRIS. The German peasant wreathes his roof with flower in rich attire, For sun-tressed Iris waves for him her urns of fragrant fire: But we have let a holier gem our lowly home illume;â The flower of love our lattice lights with undecaying bloom. FLATTERY. VENUS'S LOOKING-GLASS. Beautiful? yes! Those deep-blue eyes On heaven have gazed, till they caught its dyes; Thou hast been seeking the rose, to sip Its dewy bloom for thy balmy lip; Thou hast been out in the radiant air, Wooing the sun with thy wavy hair; For a rich gleam breaks through its braids of brown, Like a smile from Day's bright Eye sent down; Beautiful? yes! but the rose will fade; The smile grow dim which the bright eyes wear; The gloss will vanish from curl and braid, And the sunbeam die in the drooping hair! Turn from the mirror! and strive to win Treasures of loveliness still to last; Gather earth's glory and bloom within! They will be thine when youth is past. FLATTERY. VENUS'S LOOKING-GLASS. A would-be belle once broke her glass, For reflecting a loveless frown she wore; And you are breaking my heart, sweet lass, For telling you truth, like the mirror of yore! FLATTERY'S SMILE. BUCKBEAN. There's danger in the dazzling eye, That woos thee with its witching smile; Another, when thou art not by, Those beaming looks would fain beguile. FLY WITH ME. VENUS'S CAR. Gay Zephyr bore to my feet, last night, This curved and carved barouche of blue; I thought it, at first, a flower in flight: And so it will seem, perhaps, to you. But press on the foremost petal, sweet, That rose-teinted finger, soft and light, And two young doves your touch will meet, And spring from their couch to your startled sight Gay Zephyr a secret whispered low, When with the gift to my feet he flew;â It may be a fableâI thought it so: And so it will seem, perhaps, to you. But he said the queen of fairy-landâ The elfin Venus, wild and bright, With a wave of her tiny, star-tipped wand, Could charm these delicate doves to flight! At play in her firefly-lighted bower, He had heard her order her blooming car; And she smiled, as she soared in the azure flower, As smiles, in yon blue heaven, a star! Oh! could I only summon her here, And bid her bewitch the birds once more! How fit a phÃ¦ton this, my dear, To waft us lovers the wild wave o'er! You should be queen of a fairy realm! There's a trifling fault in the vehicleâtrue: It is rather too small for both, my gem: And so it will seem, I fear, to you! FOLLOW ME. STAR OF BETHLEHEM. Dost thou not see in Fancy's eye A bird with wings of emerald light, That soars, for ever, far on high, And, as it rises, beams more bright? What sings its plaintive voice to thee? âFollow, follow, follow me!â The bird is Hope! 't would lead the soul, With its sweet tones and seraph-bloom, From worldly woesâfrom earth's control: 'T will fold in heaven its shining plume! Up! up! thy spirit's pinions try! Oh! keep that brilliant warbler nigh! Dost thou not see in Fancy's eye A soft, a pure, undazzling star, That seems to melt in yonder sky, Yet still keeps smiling on afar? What speaks its eloquent smile to thee? âFollow, follow, follow me!â The star is Loveâcelestial Love! 'T would woo from bowers of bliss below, To those where broods the deathless dove, With beaming wing and breast of snow! Oh! let thy soul's affections twine, For ever, with that light divine! FOLLY. COLUMBINE. Folly of old, with gay deceit, When Love was seeking Virtue's bower, Led the bright boy to Beauty's feet; And she, in that one fatal hour, Enwove a chain so strong, so fair, It bound them both for ever there! Forget me not, for, alas! we may never meet again. One kiss for thy brow, loveâ One sigh to the pastâ One heart-echoed vow, loveâ The fondest and last!â For the true and warm-hearted In anguish must sever; It is o'erâwe are parted, Henceforth and for ever! Yet as Night's scented flower, Shunning Sunlight's caresses, Gives the hallowed star-hour All the wealth it possesses, So to thee, in thy sadness, Through darkness and doubt, My soul all its madness Of love shall breathe out. And thouâwilt thou cherish My memory yet? Yes, yes, though we perish, We cannot forget! Ah! doomed, broken-hearted, In anguish to sever! It is doneâwe are parted, Henceforth and for ever! FORGET-ME-NOT. MYOSOTIS, OR MOUSE-EAR. Lay to thy heart this token-flower! With Love's own tears its leaves are wet. 'T will whisper, in its dying hour, âDo not forget!â FRIENDSHIP. IVY. Thou art a friend indeed, Most truly true and kind; Thou givest me, in my spirit-need, Thy wealth of heart and mind! GENEROSITY. ORANGE-TREE. The truly generous still deny themselves, with cheerful pride, That, when a suffering brother pleads, he need not be denied! GRACES. HUNDRED-LEAVED ROSE. Gifted and worshipped one! genius and grace Play in each motion and beam in thy face. GRACES. HUNDRED-LEAVED ROSE. So lightâthat, gazing breathless there, Lest the celestial dream should go, You'd think the music in the air Waved the fair vision to and fro! Or that the melody's sweet flow Within the radiant creature played; And those soft wreathing arms of snow And white sylph-feet, the music made! Now gliding slow, with dreamy grace, Her eyes beneath their lashes lostâ Now motionless, with lifted face, And small hands on her bosom crossed And now, with flashing eyes, she springs, Her whole bright figure raised in air, As if her soul had spread its wings, And poised her one wild instant there! HAVE I CAUGHT YOU AT LAST? VENUS'S FLYTRAP. Have I caught you at last, gentle rover? Do I see you at length at my feet? Will you own yourself, sighing, my lover? This triumph is sudden as sweet! Long vainly I strove to allure him; That tender endeavour is past; My task must be now, to endure him! Heighho! but I've caught him at last! HEARTLESS BEAUTY. DAHLIA. The light, the grace, the brilliant bloom, Of Beauty, unendowed with heart, Resemble flowers without perfume, And just as little joy impart. HYPOCRISY. EBONY. Her brow is white as stainless snow, As ebon, black, her heart of sinâ Her cheek with morning's blush doth glow O'er midnight gloom within! HOW CAME YOU HERE? WALKING LEAF. You know mamma, can't bear you, love, You know papa dislikes you, dear; You know my brothers cut you, dove;â Alas! now came you here? You know your fortune 's gone, my own! You know your coat was made last year;â I never ramble now alone;â What could have sent you here? Perhaps you do not know, my sweetâ Sir John will soon proposeâI fear! How very awkward, should you meet! What nonsense brought you here? I vow I'm quite afraid to stir, Lest you are in the way or near! I needs must say I wish you, sir!â Oh! anywhere but here! I DIE IF NEGLECTED. LAURUSTINUS. While you cherish me, dearest, âthrough good and through ill,â Life's summer I'll bless, and its winter defy! Mid sunshine and tempest, I'll smile on thee still; But oh! if you ever neglect me, I die! While you watch o'er Love's glowing but delicate flowers, Every glance of affectionâeach soul-winged sighâ All the bloom of my cheek and my heartâshall be yours; But oh! if you leave meâyou leave me to die! In preference, I attach myself to you, but shall die if neglected. I know that thou art true to me now; But I fear that, when far, far away, In the light of some beautiful brow, The flower of faith may decay! I have seen thee look on a bright eye, love, And gaze as thou wouldst on a star; And I've murmured, with many a sigh, love. âHow blessed the beautiful are!â Yet, if passion and truth, warm and deep, As ever in woman's heart met, Have a spell, man's affection to keep, I know thou wilt never forget! I WILL ENLIGHTEN YOU. WAX MYRTLE. Sweet, let us read our hearts together, By the pure, fragrant lamp of Love! 'T will steadily burn, in stormy weather, As nowâfor it was filled above. I TRUST IN THEE. PERUVIAN HELIOTROPE. There is a flower whose modest eye Is turned with looks of light and love Who breathes her softest, sweetest sigh, Whene'er the sun is bright above. Let clouds obscure, or darkness veil, Her fond idolatry is fled; Her sighs no more their sweets exhaleâ The loving eye is cold and dead. Canst thou not trace a moral here, False flatterer of the prosperous hour? Let but an adverse cloud appear, And thou art faithless as the flower! Should foes assail me, Or friendship fail me, I'll ne'er bewail me, I trust in thee! Why should I sorrow? Thou'lt smile to-morrow, And still I'll borrow My light from thee! IMAGINATION. ALOE. For rich Imagination's jewelled wand, With living forms can fill the lonely hall; With glorious bloom, enwreath the desert-sand, And crown again, with sculpture's grace, the ruined temple's wall! I WILL NOT TROUBLE YOU. A ROSELEAF. You say your heart is now so full Of trouble and of wo, It wants but Love's first trembling tear To make it overflow. Sweet girl! believe me, Love would bring Only a roseleaf there, Whose floating bloom would bless the tide, And calm the waves of care! I WILL THINK OF IT. WHITE DAISY. âI dare not yet your prayers requite!â Exclaimed a fearful beauty; âIn Reason's golden scales, sir knight, I'll weigh my love and duty.â Love drooped his wings in grief and shame;â The scales began to waver;â But thenâa sigh, so heavy, cameâ It turned them in his favour. Be not impatient, I will think of it. Oh! bid me not so soon decide, On what, through life, to me, Or weal or wo my heart betide, A changeless fate must be! The gamester pauses ere he toss The dice, on which depends His worshipped goldâthat glittering dross, Which with existence ends;â But I must stake a priceless wealthâ Hopeâhappiness and loveâ My peace on earthâmy young heart's healthâ And moreâmy bliss above! IMMORTALITY. AMARANTH. Fling, fling the wreath of Bacchus down! For they who wear its vine-leaves here, Forego the glorious amaranth-crown Of angels in a holier sphere. INDIFFERENCE. CANDY-TUFT. Better the tie at once be broken, At once our last farewell be spoken, Than watch him, one by one, destroy The glowing buds of hope and joyâ Than thus to see them, day by day, Beneath his coldness fade away! INDISCRETION. ALMOND-TREE. Oh! lovely still! yet lost as lovelyâthou Dost veil the dazzling fairness of thy brow, And droop thy lids o'er blue and beauteous eyes, Where, all too late, the tears of shame arise! IRONY. SARDONY. When all around, with heartless mirth, At deeds of virtuous daring rail; Or coldly sneer at angel-worth, Because its schemes of goodness fail; One brow with generous anger glows, One heart a manlier verdict sends, One fearless voice unfaltering flows, In warm defence of absent friends! JUSTICE SHALL BE DONE YOU. SWEET-SCENTED TUSSILAGE, OR COLTSFOOT. They shall own thee the sweetest and fairest of flowers, That smile in our woodlands, or blush in our bowers They shall own thee a lovelier gem of delight, Than they that illumine the veil of Midnight! LET ME GO! BUTTERFLY-WEED. Nay! ours is not the morning Of love, when all is fresh and sweet, I often catch you yawning, You know, where'er we meet. For meâI must confess, love, I'm growing rather boredâand so Take back this golden tress, love, And let meâlet meâgo! Love is the poetry of life. Young Love is knocking at your heart;â Open the lattice! let him in! And blush not thusânor sigh and start! Love is not Shame, nor Grief, nor Sin. Love is an angel in disguise! Sent, with a band of brilliant flowers, To bind the soul that, exiled, sighs, And lead it home to Eden's bowers Yield to the chain that heavenward woos: Go! linked with Love, in bonds so sweet!â His wings will shower their rainbow hues, His wreath, its fragrance round your feet. LOVE IN A SNOW-WREATH. MEZEREON. One wintry morn an icicle lay, Chained, in the sunlight calm and clear, To a graceful, delicate, frost-bound spray, Like a diamond-drop in Beauty's ear. My eye was caught by a strange, rich gleam, That fitfully played in the pendant pure, And I thought I saw two bright wings beam Through the luminous ice; but I was not sure. I stole to the place, and thereâbehold! A fairy child in the icicle's heart! Tossing his tresses of curled gold, Shaking his tiny, suntipped dart;â Fluttering, striving his form to free, Like a rainbow at play in a prison, he turned; Laughing and frowning, as anger or glee, By turns, in his bosom, smiled or burned. I knew by his pinions of changeable light, I knew by his quiver and cherub-bloom, 'T was the lovely and petulant cyprian spriteâ The boy-godâcaught in that living tomb. But his sigh so soft, and his smile so warm, Were melting the icicle fast away; And lo! as I gazed, he freed his form, And plumed his wings on the frost-bound spray. âAnd how came you in it, sweet Love?â I cried; He bit his lips as he answered lowâ âI have been a fool for my pains;âI tried Young Julia's heart, with a tale of wo: âShe pitiedâreceivedâand hushed me to sleep On her tranquil breast, that knew no sin; And o'er my form soft tears did weep, But oh! so cold, they froze me in! âI woke to find myself prisoned here, In the palace of ice her tears had wrought; And if ever I trust to a woman's tear Again, may I beâin my own net, caught!â He sighedâhe shiveredâshook off the last Chill drops that hung on his plumes of light; One rueful look upon me he cast, Then rapidly rose and was lost to sight. LUXURY. HORSE-CHESTNUT. Sunny-haired Eloise! wealth is thine own; Rich is thy silken robeâbright is thy zone; Diamonds, like star-drops, thy silken braids deck; Pearls waste their snow on thy lovelier neck; Luxury softens thy pillow for sleepâ Angels watch over it!âWhy do you weep? MAJESTY. CROWN IMPERIAL. Art thou not noble? then thy brow belies thee! Thou art! I read it in thy proud dark eyes, Whose glance is truth and love, and in those lips, Whose smile is but a ray of the soul's sunshine; In thy high bearing, in thy movements, words;â Thou art of heaven's nobilityâas far Excelling earth's, as doth yon winged star, Robed in its garment of celestial glory, Outshine the earth-bound glow-worm. MELANCHOLY. WEEPING-WILLOW. How vain the task to wake my lyre To rapture's thrill, with passion's fire, While sorrow o'er my heart-strings plays, With trembling touch, her saddest lays! MELANCHOLY SPIRIT. SORROWFUL GERANIUM. Oh! there's melody rich in that mournful tone, Though with wo so heavily laden; And I'd rather be sad with thee, my own, Than gay with a happier maiden! MESSAGE. IRIS. Perchance the gods, like us, conversed with flowers, And Iris, their sweet messenger, did borrow From the rich wreaths she bore in those bright hours, Her wings' still varying hues of joy and sorrow:â Oh! were she now on earthâhow fit to bear To thee, my goddess, all my love and care! I send you a message of love on the wings of hope Fond Love, who lives in my heart for thee, Had a message this morning he wanted to send, While Fear, who will ever beside him be, Cried: âBetter beware, my friend!â But then, sweet Memory woke awhile, And softly she told in Love's true ear, Of a certain bewitching and eloquent smile, Which you have forgotten, I fear! Young Hope, who was listening, caught the sound, All beaming with light, she flew to Loveâ âOh! round my wings, be your billetdoux bound, And I'll be your carrier-dove!â 'T was doneâHope wentâ(she knows the way By heart, for she 's travelled it oft ere now)â Ah! send her back to me, sweet, I pray, With the same unclouded brow! She will furl, at your feet, her weary wing, And oh! if the billet she bears be fled, Think that Fear must have followed and loosened the stringâ And just guess all that Love would have said. MODESTY. BLUE VIOLET. The blossom that blooms in every land, Where laughs a summer-sky blue and bland! As if to tell of that blessed heaven, Whose softest hue to its heart is given! MODESTY. BLUE VIOLET. The violet droops its soft and bashful brow, But, from its heart, sweet incense fills the air;â So rich withinâso pure withoutâart thou, With modest mien and soul of virtue rare. MIRTH. BROOM. Joy, like the zephyr, That flies o'er the flower, Rippling it into Fresh fairness each hourâ Joy has waved o'er thee His sun-woven wing, And dimpled thy cheek, Like the roses of spring. ORNAMENT. HORNBEAM. She binds not her luxuriant hair With dazzling gem or costly plume, But gayly wreaths a rosebud there, To match her maiden-bloom. PEACE. OLIVE. The sinner placed a verdant spray Within her dead child's hand, And turned, in wordless grief, awayâ A lost oneâbarred and banned! In that fond act were prayer and vowâ Oh! be her guilt forgiven! Her dovelet bears an olive-bough, To make her peace with Heaven. PREFERENCE. APPLE-BLOSSOM. The idol I have set apart to worshipâ Watched overâcherishedâmused upon in absence, Until my full heart ached with tenderness! Your modesty and innocence secure you the preference. If regal sceptre, love, were mine;â Or I possessed the realms of faery, This faithful heart would still be thine, My innocent and modest Mary! Young Beauty, at my feet threw down A rose, with rare and tempting offers;â And Rank, unclasped her radiant crown:â And Wealth unlocked her loaded coffers:â But Beauty's roses soon must fly; And Love with Rank and Wealth is wary;â Thy purer charms can never die, My innocent and modest Mary! PREFERENCE. ROSE-SCENTED GERANIUM. No wonder that cheek, in its teinting transcendent, Excelleth the beauty of others by far; No wonder that eye is so richly resplendentâ Your heart is a rose, and your soul is a star! Then give back to heaven the light it bestows, Till the star smile again in its birthplace above; But oh! let me share the soft bloom of the rose, Yield, yield the warm heart to my cherishing love! PRESAGE. SMALL CAPE MARYGOLD. Your lips are like the prophet-flower;â When thus they, quivering, close, my love; We're sure to have a summer-shower, From the blue eyes that beam above. PRETENSION. WILLOW-HERB. Some women deify a friendâ Some grovel at the shrine of pelfâ A few to Heaven in worship bendâ Her idol isâher own sweet self! PROHIBITION. PRIVET. So soft is her sigh and so sweet is her smile, Even though she prohibits our pleasure the whileâ That pleasure is robbed of its charm by her voice, And e'en in her chiding we learn to rejoice. PEERLESS AND PROUD. MAGNOLIA. THE SOUTHERNER TO A YANKEE. What! write a burning billetdoux On common colored paper, And melt the wax to seal it, too, Within a tallow taper! Not thus we woo our Georgian girls, They'd scorn so poor a letter; They'd twist with it their silken curls And bid us write a better. We seek a sweeter, purer leaf, To bear our passion to them; Our vows are beautiful as brief;â I'll tell you how we woo them. Deep in our southern forest-glooms, Our tempests proudly braving, The pure magnolia richly blooms, Its peerless blossoms waving. We pluck the leaf of perfumed snow, We trace love-verses on it, And as the quick thoughts breathe and glow, The flower makes sweet the sonnet! We tell the maid it mocks, in hue, Her fair and virgin forehead; We say her lips' delicious dew The blossom's balm has borrowed. Our sweet appeal, in secret bower, We bid her con apart, And trace it on as fair a flower, Her own unsullied heart. 'T is writ with plumes from Cupid's wingâ With passion's kiss we seal it, Then free to Zephyr's care we fling Our light and blooming billet! Well guarded from blockade and breach, Must be that heart unsleeping, Such fragrant vows would fail to reach, Or fail, when reached, in keeping! RESERVE. MAPLE. If her feelings, those buds of the heart, Are slow their soft petals to partâ Too timid to brook The world's cold look; And dreading the slanderer's dart;â When once they unfold in perfume, They glow like the warm golden bloom Which the maple-tree shows, When its blossoms unclose, Like light in the deep forest-gloom. RESOLVE THE RIDDLE. TREMELLA NOSTOC. You say that my heart is a riddle to you;â Do you take enough interest in it, To find out its meaning?âfor oh! if you do, As your proper reward, you shall win it! You have the power to restore me to happiness. Will you say no, dear, When soft and low, dear, Love pleads for love, which you only can give? Will you then fly me? Can you deny me? One little âyesâ would allow me to live. Care hovers o'er me, Clouds, wild and stormy, Darken before meâbut one smile of thine, Through sorrow's haze, love, Softly can raise, love, Hope's sunny rainbowâbright and benign! RICHES. CORN. She had passed through the shadow and sunlight of Life, She had learned, in its storms, to exult and endure, And her gentle reply, with sweet wisdom, was rifeâ âTo meâthere are none in the universe poor!â SADNESS. DEAD LEAVES. We keep a rainbow all the time, Within our lattice low; Our vase is crowned with autumn-leaves, Through which the sun doth glow, Lighting up each transparent, gorgeous shadeâ Green, crimson, purple, goldâall blending in one braid. SECRET LOVE. MOTHERWORT. Yes! tell himâtell him I am well, Say that this cheek doth deeper glow, Than was its wontâbut do not tell, 'T is the heart's fever makes it so! And tell him how my lip has curled, And named his name with idle smile; But do not tell him for the world, That tears were in mine eyes the while! SOUL OF MY SOUL. VIRGINIAN JESSAMINE. Oh! the pet and the darling of natureâwhose plume, Through the woods, like a sunbeam, doth playfully dartâ The humming-bird! bathing in dew and perfume, That hide in the crimson jasmine's heart, While he blends, with the blossom, his own rich bloom, Till you hardly can tell them apart. SILENCE. WHITE ROSE. Hush, sweet, hush! Let me read in your blush, All that you tremble and fear to tell;â Why should you speak, When that eloquent cheek And those soul-lit eyes can talk so well? SIMPLICITY. WILD OR DOG ROSE. She clasps no golden zone of pride, Her fair and simple robe aroundâ By flowing riband, lightly tied, Its graceful folds are bound: And thus attiredâa sportive thing, Pure, loving, guileless, bright, and wild, Proud Fashion! match me in your ring, New England's mountain-child! SHARPNESS. BARBERRY. Now Fate preserve theeâlady fair!â I will not breathe the Frenchman's prayer, Who to the maiden's great alarm, Exclaimed: âGod pickle you, madame!â But âFate preserve thee!ââeven as they, Our housewives notable, allay, With sugared sweets, an acid juice, And store it up for future use;â So âFate preserve thee,â or thou'lt stay, Unplucked, upon the parent-tree; Like barberries only fit to be Packed in a gallipot away; Unless thy sharpness be effaced, Thou 'rt far too sour to suit my taste. SLEEP OF THE HEART. WHITE POPPY. You can charm to sleep the physical powers, With the oil distilled from a poppy's leaves;â Say, can your science find us flowers, Whose magic may hush a heart that grieves? My heart would be at ease, if my solitude were blest with your society. If thou wert here, my fairy-queen! With all thy graces, wiles, and spells, How soon would show this sylvan scene, What magic in thy presence dwells! The crests of foam the wavelets wear, Would change to crowns of living pearl; And balm would be the ambient air, And radiant joy the sun, my girl! SPLENDOUR. LOBELIA. She stood 'mid the dazzling insignia of Wealth; But the jewels, that shone o'er her beauty and bloom, Were less fair than the sunny ray smiling by stealth, Through the rose-teinted damask, that curtained the room. STRENGTH. FENNEL. The wealth of rich feelingsâthe deepâthe pureâ With strength to meet sorrow and faith to endure. SUSPICION. MUSHROOM. Better confide and be deceived, A thousand times, by treacherous foes, Than once accuse the innocent, Or let suspicion mar repose. THE HEART THAT KNOWS NOT LOVE. WHITE ROSEBUD. When Love was born in Eden's bower, The first soft blush of Eve was shed On a white roseâher emblem-flowerâ Which ever since has blossomed red! TIME. WHITE POPLAR. And Time, with a footstep soft and light, As the maiden's own, went by that night. TIMIDITY. MARVEL OF PERU. The blossom that bashfully shuns the daylight, And yields all its sweetness and bloom unto night. THANKFULNESS. AGRIMONY And the nuns used to dream, as they roamed about The convent-garden of St. Ursula, That, at matins and vespers, a peal rang out, From the fairy bells of the campanula. THINK OF ME. PANSY, OR HEART'S-EASE. Oh! long may the blossom, whatever betide, The tenderest breath of the summer-wind win, And smile in its beauty, thy threshold beside, Bright symbol, sweet lady of heart's-ease within! TREACHERY. BILBERRY. Thou hast comeânot to cherishâ To win but my heart;â It is thine till it perish;â Now, trifler, depart! TRUTH. BITTER-SWEET NIGHTSHADE. I love a hand that meets mine own With grasp that causes some sensation; I love a voice whose varying tone From Truth has learned its modulation. UTILITY. GRASS. Lovely as usefulâstill this graceful grass Reminds me of the modest peasant-lass, Who blooms in lowly lifeâthe kind and fair, Warmed by glad Nature's sun and freshened by her air! VARIETY. CHINA-ASTER. The greatest wonder, Mary, Is this, that while, to me, Your charms each moment vary, Your heart should constant be. VIRGIN PRIDE. GENTIANA FRITILLARIA. Her arms were folded on her breast, In purity and pride, With modest sweetness, when addressed, Her low soft voice replied. WILL YOU PLEDGE ME? SIDESADDLE-FLOWER. Come, pledge me, sweet, in Adam's cup, 'T is pure and fresh like thee: The wine that pleasure's votaries sup Will stain the spirit free; But here can be nor shade nor sin For you can see your face within! WIN ME AND WEAR ME. LADY'S SLIPPER. I am not to be drawn off and on like the trifle, Whose name is bestowed on the blossom I send; My affections no dreaming romancer shall rifle, If our vows be not heart-hallowedâhere let them end. YOUR BLUSH HAS WON ME. AZALEA. I know a cheek whose blushes, As they trembling come and go, I could gaze upon for ever, If it did not pain thee so. YOUR IMAGE IS ENGRAVEN ON MY HEART. SPINDLE-TREE. Love drew your picture in my âheart of heart,â And memory preserves it beautiful YOU PUZZLE ME. LOVE IN A MIST. You say that you love me; Yet say it with tears, Alternately waking My hopes and my fears! You smile on my passion, You pout, as you smile; And you turn from my touch, While my heart you beguile. You bid me begone! And you frown if I go. Your blushes say âYes!â While your tongue murmurs, âNo!â You kiss me and vow That you hate to be kissed! Ah! truly I'm nothing But âlove in a mist.â YOUR QUALITIES SURPASS YOUR CHARMS. MIGNIONETTE. Your soul is fairer than your face, Your genius brighter than your smile; Yet in your every outward grace, Is beauty that might well beguile, Without the charm of heart and mind, An angel, in yon heaven enshrined. YOUR FROWN I DEFY. ANEMONE. Your coldness I heed not, Your frown I defy, Your affection I need not; The time has gone by, When a blush or a smile on that cheek could beguile My soul from its safety, with witchery's wile! Then, lady, look kindly, Or frown on me still, No longer all blindly I yield to your will! Too tightly you drew the light reins of command, And your victim is freeâfor they broke in your hand FLOWERS. Oh! they looked upward in every place Through this beautiful world of ours, And dear as a smile on an old friend's face Is the smile of the bright, bright flowers! They tell us of wanderings by woods and streams; They tell us of lanes and trees; But the children of showers and sunny beams Have lovelier tales than theseâ The bright, bright flowers! They tell of a season when men were not, When earth was by angels trod, And leaves and flowers in every spot Burst forth at the call of God; When spirits, singing their hymns at even, Wandered by wood and glade, And the Lord looked down from the highest heaven, And blessed what he had madeâ The bright, bright flowers! That blessing remaineth upon them still, Though often the storm-cloud lowers, And frequent tempests may soil and chill The gayest of earth's flowers. When Sin and Death, with their sister Grief, Made a home in the hearts of men, The blessing of God on each tender leaf Preserved in their beauty thenâ The bright, bright flowers! The lily is lovely as when it slept On the waters of Eden's lake; The woodbine breathes sweetly as when it crept In Eden from brake to brake. They were left as the proof of the loveliness Of Adam and Eve's first home: They are here as a type of the joys that bless The just in the world to comeâ The bright, bright flowers!</field>
