      <field name="fulltext">“NICK'S RATIFICATION A rat attempting once to peel A sleeping lad, named Nick O'Neil, One of his friends suggested that He should procure a Tabby-cat. THE DOCTOR'S ADVICE If the fat-lip Come from cat-nip, Then on that lip Rub some cat-nip. FOR A YOUNGSTER If what I have sung— Stirred the heart of a youngster, 'Twill not be in vain That I rattled my brain. REPLY To Mr. Austin Dobson— Dear Sir: It is a cruel stab With Edgar Poe to measure Tabb: As well with Tennyson to rate The present Poet Laureate. EXPLANATION 'Tis evident that such a name As mine to Mr. Dobson came, Like Cinderella's shoe—it fit The foot; so, on he buckled it. Always affectionately yours.” WHY THE JOURNEY IS MADE 'Tis not with gold, I hear, The Wise Man starts to Frisco! But, haply, to demur If matters there amiss go; And, if incensed, to stir With direst threats—“obispo.” KEEP YOUR RYE OPEN No man, dear doctor, can deny Your rhymes are worthy of your Rye. And this to me Is what in spirits best I find— Or in a jug, or in mankind— Viz., Pure-Rye-ty. IN HELL “Pere ?'s dead! Ah, it is well; He'll never worry us in hell!” IN PURGATORY “His sins were long ago forgiven; So let him pass at once to heaven.” IN HEAVEN “He did God's will by night and day, But always in the devil's way.” ON EARTH “'Twould lessen joy or deepen woe, If where he went we'd have to go.” DOING WELL I'll be hanged if you haven't done well To hang up a rebel who likes to rebel; But whether you send me to heaven or hell, An unredeemed rebel I'll faithfully dwell. “VARIETY IS THE SPICE OF LIFE” Contrasts are striking, Teddy knows; And so, for a variety, The Black man to the White House goes, Rough-riding o'er society. We wonder how “the spice of life” Impressed the daughter and the wife. A SECOND-TERM SCENTED We wonder much how Roose-felt When Booker Washington he smelt; And if he lives in expectation Of a new in-nigger-ation. A TABB-LOW (A duet by two who can't do it—D?and B?) “Tabb's dead! and we who always keep The Rule of Silence when we sleep, Agreed, for his detested sake, To keep it sometimes when awake, So that his students all might see What lofty scorn of him had we.” D. “Go now, and get your ‘little ting,’ And we shall both Te Deum sing.” B. “Te Deum!” D. “Hush! The chant you spoil And mispronounce the second voil. Tee Dyum you should say, like me.” B. “Now den, you don't know “Fa” from ‘Si’.” D. “Ah, B? ?, keep your temper, do, Or Silence I shall keep with you. Look there! I'll take my solemn oath Tabb's body's grinning at us both.” APPENDIX I. UNCOLLECTED POEMS CHORISTERS O wind and waters, ye alone Have chanted the primeval tone Since Nature first began. All other voices change, but ye Abide, the soul of harmony Interpreting the man. He listens, and his heart is fain To fashion an immortal strain; Yet his sublimest lay Is but the music of a tongue Attuned to silence, and among The echoes dies away. OUR FIRST-BORN It died so young! and yet, Of all that vanished hence, Is none to lingering regret So lost as Innocence: For wheresoe'er we go, Whatever else remain, That Favorite of Heaven, we know, We shall not find again. MUTATION Till comes the crescent Moon, We worship each a Star; But in the region of Noon, Alike forgotten are The lesser and the larger light That ruled the destinies of Night. Anon, the darkness near, Within their dim domain To Memory appear The twilight Gods again; And Reverence beneath their sway Forgets the Sovereignty of Day. THE IMAGE-MAKER “Thou shalt no graven image make;” And yet, O sculptor, for the sake Of such an effigy as I— The superscription like the face Disfigured now, and hard to trace— Didst thou thyself consent to die. SUNDERED Thou sleepest sound, and I Anear thee lie, Yet worlds apart: Thou in the light of dreams; I, where the midnight seems— An ashen sea— From this my world and that wherein thou art To blot out all but me. ANIMULA VAGA A spirit from the grave Again I come, E'en as I vanished, save Disrobed and dumb. No shadow as I pass— However clear The wave on mirroring glass— Betrays me near; Nor unto them that live Forlorn of me, A signal can I give Of sympathy. Ah, better 'twere to hide Where none appear, Than thus in death abide To life so near! POE'S COTTAGE AT FORDHAM Here, where to pinching penury the gloom Of Death was wedded, came Immortal Love, And Genius, with all the pomp thereof, To consecrate a temple and a tomb. AUGURY Before the dawn, 'tis light, If Hope the vigil keep; Before the noon-tide, night, Of Woe, despairing, weep: The Future 'tis that shows What now the present knows. UNDERTOW In boreal calm the spirit feels A far-off thunder-roll, And through each tropic passion steals A current from the pole. DAWN Love told a Star the vision that beguiled His slumber; and the Darkness, hearing, smiled. A FOOT-RULE Father Tabb's comment upon Mr. Punch's recent remarks on the subject of poetical feet: When a poet gives his hand, Meet it is to greet the greeter. When his feet in question stand, It is metre. SIGNALS The prophet Star, the Maiden Dawn, the Sun— So light begins his reign; Then Sunset, widowed Twilight, and anon The prophet Star again. IMPORT Thou hast the final touch supplied That till thy coming was denied— A single letter in a word Whose absence all the context blurred; A missing note that, but for thee, Had marred the perfect harmony. THE VAMPIRE MOON The vital vapors to absorb, The moon, with famished gaze, Suspends her lean, malignant orb Above a dying face. I watch her like a folded flower, As silently expand The pulses waving hour by hour And heavier the hand, Till she hath brimmed her cup; and I An empty chalice hold; My heart, in agony, as dry, In wintriness as cold. SUFFICIT We are alone! The night-winds moan For envy, and the sobbing rain Protests in vain. How deep their darkness! But our night, Than day more bright, Needs not the glimmering orbs above, But only Love. IN TOUCH How slight soe'er the motion be, With palpitating hand The gentlest breaker of the sea Betrays it to the land. And though a vaster mystery Hath set our souls apart, Each wafture from eternity Reveals thee to my heart. TIDES Like inland streams, O Sea, Thro' joy and pain All nature dreams of thee; Nor more appears Thy life in mist or rain Than in our tears. NIGHT-BORN The fairest blossom of the light Was nurtured in the womb of Night, An alien to the Sun; And to her bosom must she need Recall each love-selected seed, When blossom-time is done. And we—by baptism of sleep Her children—waken but to keep The memory of charms And promises, that ne'er too soon Despite the blandishments of Noon Restore us to her arms. ALFRED TENNYSON The lordliest at Arthur's Table Round No loftier than thou, The laureate, with England's glory crowned, Whom Death has knighted now. AUTUMN-GLOW If this the preface be of death In crimson, green, and gold, What wondrous art illumineth The story still untold? VICTORIA Now from the throne of England one is borne, Whom all men mourn, Nor more as queen, than for the life that stood The type of Motherhood. MY SERVANT Lord, wheresoe'er I am, Thou art, In love subservient to me, Still tendering a lowlier port Than saint or angel unto me. JACET LEO XIII “Behold the aged Lion, Lord, I am, Now come to lay me down Beside the Lamb.” A CARCANET I give thee, love, a carcanet, With all the rainbow splendor set, Of diamonds that drink the sun, Of emeralds that feed upon His light as doth the evergreen, A memory of spring between This frost of whiter pearls than snow, And warmth of violets below A wreath of opalescent mist, Where blooms the tender amethyst; Here, too, the captives of the mine— The sapphire and the ruby—shine, Rekindling each a hidden spark, Unquenched by buried ages dark, Nor dimmed beneath the jeweled skies, Save by the sunlight of thine eyes. WAVES We sighed of old till underneath His feet Our pulses beat, Again to sigh in restlessness until He saith, “Be still.” And with us is the ever-moving wind, And all mankind— A triple chorus—each upheaving breast, A sigh for rest. TO THE FREEDMAN Friend of the dusky visage, whereupon When all things else have yielded to the light Abides the cleaving shadow of a night The darker for the noonday's fiercer sun; Among earth's kindred nations nearer, none Than thine and mine. Thou standest in the fight, A slave beside a master for whose right Thine arm, with his uplifted, lost or won. Nay; now the victor vanquished, when the foe Exulting in a land of bondage free, Flung out the signal, “Smite the smiter!” lo, Thou wouldst not; but with new-wed Liberty Wentest thy way—nor yet as glad to go, But oft in tears that all the world might see. THE JEWESS A mother she in Israel, With eyes, like Jacob's well, Untouched by time—their tender grace, As from the Temple's inmost place, Telling the twofold mystery Of Eden and Gethsemane. REPOSE I laid me down in solitude, but not alone: The night was with me, and the stars above me shone; The Earth, my mother, pillowed me, and to her breast I nestled as a weary child that yearns for rest. The drowsy ripple of a stream that murmured near With lisping leaves made lullaby to soothe mine ear; But o'er the mystery of calm my brooding mind Hung as an eagle motionless upon the wind, Till stirred with energy of thought, on pinions strong, Through swift-receding centuries it swept along, Far out of space and period, where yet of time No wave had drifted to disturb the depth sublime. Then, lo! from vastness infinite, one lonely ray Gleamed, trembling in its solitude, upon the way, And through the region measureless, a whisper came— A thrill of hidden majesty that breathed my name: “Yon beam upon immensity that breathed my name: From all eternity hath been thy dwelling, Man. There wast thou, ever intimate, a thought of Him— The One-Intelligence—that spans the ages dim. The time, the place, all influence prevailing here, In pregnant lineament conceived, was imaged there; For in the mystic harmony of Nature kind, These kindred elements fulfil a chord designed, The shadows that encompass thee, the soothing sleep, The swathing dreams elysian, the silence deep, All speak one calm Original, whose power divine Hath wrought for them a destiny that measures thine; For all to man are ministrants of heavenly love, Out-breathings from the Fountain-head of rest above.” A TRAVELLER'S GUIDE This is the way to Lullaby Town, To Lullaby Town, to Lullaby Town— First go up, and then go down: This is the way to Lullaby Town. Folks that go to Lullaby Town, To Lullaby Town, to Lullaby Town— Travel each in a snow-white gown; This is the dress for Lullaby Town. Dreams have homes in Lullaby Town, In Lullaby Town, in Lullaby Town— Dreams that smile, for never a frown Enters the gates of Lullaby Town. SEEMING FAILURE O wave upon the strand! What urges thee in vain To lift the baffled hand In suppliance again? “The passion that impels The tidal energies In every bud that swells, In every soul that sighs: “The same that on the cross Sustained the dying Christ, When Love for seeming Loss Alone was sacrificed.” THE DYING BOY TO THE WIND-FLOWERS And have ye come again, Dim seedling of the Dew? Long waiting have I lain In wintriness like you, Through many a month of pain, And wondered if ye knew: And whether ye, unchanged Despite the sundering snow, When back to light ye ranged, My altered face would know, Or deem the heart estranged That late had loved you so. But now with glances sweet Ye've wandered back today, Your lagging friend to meet, And chide his long delay. Behold, with willing feet I follow! Lead the way! COBWEBS A net to catch the earliest gleam Of westward swimming light; On hammock of the latest dream That left the shores of night. THE PRECIPICE Above the fathomed deep Of Death, we move in sleep, And who among us knows How near the brink he goes? THE TOUCH-ME-NOT So ticklish is my skin That if you touch my side The little seed within Will laugh, and split me wide. So, when I see you near The mirth-provoking spot, No wonder that I fear, And bid you touch-me-not. CHRISTMAS GREETING Good morning, Lord! For little boys The Day more generous to joys Than unto men, they say; If so, for greater happiness Teach us Thy holy name to bless With fuller hearts than they. MOUNTAIN-BORN How hast thou, little spring, The heart to sing, Leaving thy lofty home For yonder plain, Whence ne'er again Returning canst thou come? “Nay not as now I go; But mute as snow,” The laughing wave replies; “To crown the height, In vapors white Again I nightly rise.” MY SOUL In my body bides a guest, Time-born for Eternity— Ne'er to mortal manifest; To my very self unknown; Visible to God alone, And revealing Him to me. GOOD FRIDAY Behold in every crimson glow Of earth and sky and sea, The Hand that fashioned them doth show Love crucified for me. HEREDITY The children of the night, The star, the glowworm bright, The dewdrop clear, In livery of light Undimmed appear. The children of the Day, The cleaving shadows gray, Wan vigils keep, Twice on their twilight way His doom to weep. TO A DROP OF POISON As once, the seal of Solomon beneath, The Genius in bonds, rebellious lay; So lieth here a mightier captive Death, Fate-bound his fond deliverer to slay. IN SHADOW Heeds yonder star thy song, O warbler of the night? “I know not, for the way is long That leads unto the light. But as the music of the spheres, A twinkling silence here appears, Perchance my warbling from afar Appears a star.” SUBMISSION Since to my smiting enemy Thou biddest me be meek, Lo, gladlier, my God, to Thee I turn the other cheek. GENEVIEVE Genevieve was all to me, Heart to heart we toiled together; Shade in summer heat was she, Sunshine in the cloudy weather. Now alas, no more to me, Genevieve is dead. Genevieve was fair as May, Eyes that dreamed the light of heaven, Locks whereon the life beams lay; E'en in death to her were given Sunshine sped in clouds away, Genevieve is dead. Genevieve, not all in vain Fell thy sands of life before me, Hope in every golden grain, Star-like glimmers to allure me To a life beyond the main, To a love not dead. STABAT MATER In the shadow of the rood, Broken-hearted there she stood Near her Son and Lord; While her soul, His doom lamenting, Yet in sacrifice consenting, Felt the cleaving sword. Thou alone no ransom needing, Let thy Son, the Victim bleeding, For my sin atone; What for me, my God and Brother Deigns to bear, O sinless Mother, Lean not thou alone. To the lash, for sin atoning, Lo, He bows! and thou, O moaning Mother, now must see Limb from limb His spirit languish, And His latest looks of anguish, Turned in love to thee! Came there ever to another Grief like thine, O wounded Mother, As thou lookest upon Him, the Son of God, all holy, And of thee, a virgin lowly, Sole-begotten Son? Who so lost to human feeling As to hide his tears revealing Sympathy with thine? Who that e'er was born of woman, In a tenderness so human, Sees not love divine? Let me near the fountain growing Of thy tenderness o'erflowing, Drink my fill thereof; Let the fervid flames illuming All thy soul, a fire consuming, Kindle mine to love. One with thee, my vigil keeping; One with thee, the mourner, weeping Near His sacred side, Where thy soil in desolation Waits of woe the consummation, Let my soul abide. Virgin, earth's divinest blossom, Spurn not from thy fragrant bosom Dews that fall for thee! Make me, near thy Son remaining, Simon-like, His cross sustaining, One in sympathy! Let me from His life-distilling Wounds, mine empty chalice filling, Quaff the crimson wine; Let the flames, devouring, end me, In thy chastity defend me, From the wrath divine. Lord, through her who brought Thee hither, Let me, hence departing whither Thou the way hast found, Come through Death's opposing portal, To the Victor's palm immortal, With Thy glory crowned. THE MESSAGE Let every South American beware, for lo! the strenuous man, our sovereign lord and master, says: Unless you quickly mend your ways, Upon your bended necks you'll feel The impression of my armed heel, A thing that every Filipino Has learned as thoroughly as we know. J. B. T. SUBWAY THEOLOGY Bishop Potter, finding hotter Passions than there used to be, To the Gospel bids defiance, And appeals to modern science For the remedy. Saint and devil on a level Walked of late where all men saw; But the wise, by his example, Travel now a subway ample. Paved with fragments of the law. Here this up-to-date instructor Gives each clerical conductor Transfers for the nuptial route, So that they who feel the folly Of the matrimonial trolley May, at will, get out. VOX DEI “Some said it thundered.” The Father speaking to the Son, In all the multitude was none That caught the meaning true. And yet “This word from Heaven,” said He, “Was spoken not because of me— But came because of you.” Thus through the Son of Man alone The mysteries of God are known; Thus to the chosen few With eye and ear attentive found He speaks in every sight and sound, The old becoming new. DAISIES Peacemakers ye, the daisies, from the soil Upbreathing wordless messages of love, Soothing of earth-born brethren the toil And lifting e'en the lowliest above. THE ASTRONOMER The little dome that holds the brain Whereby he measures from afar, The influence of steadfast star Or moving moon and sun— Both vaster mysteries contain Than those he looks upon; Nay, such the marvel that perchance The spheres in mute amazement scan, The while they meet his upward glance, The deeper mind of man. ST. CHRISTOPHER It was a very little Boy That on the river side Stood calling, “Ferryman, ahoy! Come, take me o'er the tide!” The Ferryman came wading on, And seeing but a child, “Get up upon my shoulder, Son,” He said, and, stooping, smiled. But when into the stream again The giant boldly strode, His every muscle was astrain Beneath the growing load; Till finally, with failing strength, He reached the other bank, And putting down the Boy, at length Upon the margin sank. “Who art thou,” wondering, he cried, “That hast so burdened me?” “The Son of God,” the Boy replied, “Who bore the Cross for thee. “Henceforth thy task pursuing here For love of souls forlorn Thou'lt bear the name of Christopher, As thou the Christ hast borne; “And little sufferers that see How great is thy reward Shall cry, ‘like Christopher are we Thy Ferrymen, O Lord.’” TO SIDNEY LANIER The same blue-bending dome encanopies Thine ashes and the spark that kindles mine; Upon the selfsame bosom we recline, When with the wind, the wave, land-lessening, dies And, 'twixt our souls the star-wrought mysteries— Of Hope the sacred oracles divine— Steadfast above the vault of darkness shine, To point the path benighted to the skies. For there, of dreams unsepulchred, and free “To face the vast sweet Visage, unafraid,” That erst thy spirit reverenced to see In Nature's lowliest lineaments portrayed, Thou keepest watchful memory of me, A lingering phantom of the mortal shade. APPENDIX II. UNPUBLISHED POEMS OF THE BROWNE-TABB ALBUM THE MINIATURE I know not whence; but on the morning air A ghastly whisper pales my waking cheek; A shudder in its warning seems to speak, “Beware!” I woke: the wind at intervals, A mournful vigil kept, As o'er a sepulchre, around The chamber where I slept. The casement rattled in the blast, The breathing curtains stirred; Anon, throughout their shroudy length, A stifled sigh was heard— A brooding dread, low whispering In mystic monotone— “It was a deed of darkness, And in the darkness done.” Again at noon, but thinner, faintlier, there As spent with vigil, heaves a stifled sigh (I turn to see; but nothing meets the eye) “Beware!” The pallor of a wasted lamp, A fitful glimmer flung Athwart a miniature above The sculptured mantel hung, Where gleams of melancholy light, With conscious shadows wrought Upon the lineaments portrayed A malady of thought— A dim-remembered agony, Interpreting the tone— “It was a deed of darkness, And in the darkness done!” At twilight grim, in nature's dumb despair, As swoops the prowling darkness of the day, Throbs, in a sudden torment of dismay, “Beware!” Aghast, I listened, motionless, When lo! a chilling sound— The vague pulsation of a heart Beneath a mortal wound— And from the picture quivering, As smitten wan with pain Dark, stormy drops fell suddenly As a reluctant rain: And still the moaning monody Rhymed on in undertone— “It was a deed of darkness And in the darkness done.” At midnight, like an incantation drear, The hollow tide in broken thunder-tone Sobs, with the beating of my heart, a groan, “Beware!” The spectral eyes drooped languidly, The hand convulsive clung, The bell of midnight clashed the hour With stern prophetic tongue; Then, all was blank—oblivious In icy calm I lay— The morning whitened to behold My raven tresses gray; And beats forever on my brain The throbbing monotone— “It was a deed of darkness And in the darkness done.” Thus, as a strain bewildered, everywhere, The trooping echoes of a formless fear, Like startled phantoms, flock upon my ear, “Beware!” RUIN It stands like Night, The sepulchre of a departed light, Whose glory gone, Each hoary vestige chronicles Of crumbling stone. The portal now, A broken arch majestic, as a brow O'er Evening's eye, Catches an azure glimpse beyond Of fading sky. On either hand, Grim sentinels, the lofty turrets stand, With many a scar Of Time and tameless Elements That wage his war. The windows tall Stare blindly from the ivy-shagged wall Of massive power, Stern as the eyeless Nazarite In Gaza's tower. O'er shattered frieze, O'er buried plinth and capital, the breeze That wanders by, Woos the rank weed, low answering Its plaintive sigh. Time was, when one, Mild as a maiden star to look upon, Of pensive mood, Here wrought a destiny obscure In solitude. Vague phantoms wove, About her being, sympathies that move To subtle thought— Seraphic reveries that lure The soul distraught, Unto her mind The melting moonlight and the moving wind, The molten gleam Of starry beacons jewelling The limpid stream; The sheen and shade Of waking dawn and drowsy twilight made— Each multiform Design of earth and ocean, Calm and storm— Spake mysteries, Revealing all the harmony that lies In things we see: Of life and death, the tides of joy And misery. So grew her soul, Enamored of the spirits that control The universe, That powers beyond the visible Communed with hers, And each became The warder of a consecrated flame; As angels high O'ershadowing the crystal shrine Of Chastity. But light, alas! As to the stainless dewdrops in the grass, A fatal gleam Smote of its own satiety The splendid dream; And swift as fire, Doom-driven to the wanton wind's desire A hurricane Of howling desolation leaped The cloistered brain, Wild as the woe That rends the womb of Nature in the throes Of mountain-birth, Shuddered the dome celestial And startled Earth, With Echoes torn From raping wrath and agonies of scorn— A demon cry— Lost in this dark contending cloud Of Destiny. The curse was past; A sullen vapor silently o'ercast The naked Night, Till Ruin, hideous with Morn, Appalled the sight. THE GHOST CHAMBER Into the lonely room, Spawning an icy gloom, Lost in a wandering swoon Gloats the wide-horned moon. Silent the shadows gray Shrink from her touch away, Loathing her leprous light Spotting the robe of Night, Moulting a hoary gloom Over a haunted room. Cometh no whisper there: Spasms of dank despair Curdle the echoes round, Stifling the birth of sound In the grim charnel-womb Of the deserted room. Stark are the staring walls, Like unto lidless balls— Domes of departed sleep— Doomed evermore to keep Watch o'er the prisoned gloom Of the forsaken room. THE BRIDE ELECT When God created man, Of destiny so dim, And deigned His work to scan, Behold, He pitied him; Nay, more, for love of him began A greater mystery to plan. Within the sleeper's brain, His waking hours to bless, Was born—alas! in vain— A dream of loveliness That ne'er Omniscence had known In light of shadeless heaven alone. This vision of the night The Image-Maker caught And for his soul's delight, A revelation wrought Out of the dreamer's open side— Flesh of his flesh—a virgin bride. CHOPIN Soul, that in music, as a flower in light, Didst gem, and bloom, and vanish, with a breath That mist-like o'er the sullen tide of death Keeps fragrant still the memory of thy flight; Dost thou, immortal, on the topmost height Of harmony, forget the world beneath, And all its chords tumultuous? Wandereth No echo upwards through the sundering night? Aye; notes of thine own making, now forlorn, Like fledglings fluttered from the nest of love, Tell of thy care; while with harmonious wing They fan the depths of silence, listening To hear anon thy mandate from above, Hence to their home, thy bosom, to return. DISTANCE Fair sorceress, upon thy calm domain We gaze in ceaseless wonder, compassed round By slow-expanding visions interwound With phantasies of pleasure, hope, and pain. In thee life's wearied echoes find again A silent fold: in thee each herald sound, As in an Ocean's slumberous depth profound, Awaits the future and her shadowy train. All hearts the mild enchantment of thy sway Subdues to subtlest sympathies benign— To thee the golden Present, day by day, For some far-glittering idol we resign, And, like to exiles, homeward journeying, say: “Our sighs, our dreams, our longings, all are thine.” THE INDIAN Still westward with the lessening light ye go, Dejected people, and the forests tall, Bewidowed of their dusky children, fall Behind you with an echoing wail of woe. Year after year the warrior winds lay low The leafy tribes, and with prophetic call Denounce the silent massacre of all Before the pale usurper's conquering bow. Heed ye the signs? or look your longing eyes Beyond the winter, where the selfsame voice, Warm with the breath of unawakened flowers, Comes softly singing to the world, “Rejoice! The snow is gone: and with the April showers Each buried seed is hastening to arise!” PREMONITION As when at Mary's voice Elizabeth Felt in her womb the restlessness of feet That would outrun delaying birth, and greet Alike unseen, the Conqueror of Death: So, at the hour of midnight, wakes a breath That in the womb of darkness, moves to meet The soul of Morning, and a silence sweet As incense tells of one that worshipeth. Yea; life forever in expectancy Stands tip-toe on the utmost brink of time, Hushing the past, and listening to hear (As poets the inevitable rhyme) A dream's fulfilment in the echoes clear That sing the present in futurity. THE SCORE This is the chart that tells of one who went, Like John, into the wilderness alone— Into a land of Silence, all unknown Till thither by the Muses he was sent. And we upon his wanderings intent Must mark his perilous footsteps, tone by tone, Or else be lost in mazes overgrown With Discord, in a place of banishment. Alone he went; but from his solitude Returning, lo, there followed him a train Of Echoes in an innumerable brood— By Fancy from their sylvan sleep beguiled, But ne'er from wedded Harmonies atwain, Henceforth to slumber in their native wild. SWINBURNE How far soe'er thou wanderest from His law, The gift of God we reverence in thee, Painting thy thought in gorgeous pageantry, To thrill the soul with ecstacy and awe— Now with voluptuous syllables to draw Remorseful tears; now, like the wintry sea, All tempest-tongued, in midnight majesty, Dread as the void primeval darkness saw. For, since Titanic Milton smote the sky, And echoes in the depths responsive found Of chaos and the howling gates of hell, No messenger of song hath soared so high, Nor strewn with ranker luxury the ground, Than thou, that singest of the worst so well. ADEST “Heaven is not far,” the Violet saith, “The fragrance of my censer-breath, That lures to Love, Upon the altar whence it came Commingles with the sacred flame That burns above.” MY BIRTH-CHAMBER When first I wakened from the night, Within that lonely room, Methought in exile lived the Light That left me in the goom— Its destiny henceforth to be With memories apart from me. “BREAK, BREAK, BREAK” Break, silent Dawn, and flood with light The fathomless abyss of night; Break, thunderous Ocean, till the bound Of utmost silence swim with sound; Break, troubled heart! No more for thee Shall light, or sound, or motion be. A LEPER'S GRAVE Here, where untainted flesh Hath dread Corruption's bride to be, Her life-long victim finds A bed From her embraces free. LEGEND The Brook goes babbling to the Sea In language of the Land, Of hill, and dale, and leafy tree, Of song-bird, fragrant flower, and bee, Beyond the sloping strand. Alas! 'Tis all a mystery! She doth not understand. LIGHTS IN DARKNESS The Moon, like Mary, bore to be The partner of His agony. The Sun, in pity for the race, Like God, the Father, hid his face, That, haled as witness, he might say, “I saw not, for I turned away.” THE QUEST O Time, where hast thou laid My Self of yesterday? Where at his tomb I prayed I come again to pray— 'Tis empty! Who hath hither strayed And taken him away? THE RIDDLE Out of the Eater, meat: Thou dost the streams devour. Out of the strong, the sweet; The brine begets the shower. 'Tis thus, O Samson Sea, I solve thy mystery. SONG Nay, thou hast not my heart Or I such cruel smart No more could feel; Nor, with my heart couldst thou Still heartless prove as now Its wound to heal. SURVIVAL “Each plays his part and goes his way,” Our hearts at seeming distance say; But twixt the blossom and the fruit— The topmost twig and lowest root, Till seed again to seed shall fall— There lies no languid interval; And soul is life-allied to soul As parts unto the perfect whole. VALE God speed thee, setting sun! Thy beams for me have spun Of light today A memory that one Alone could bring, and none Can take away. WHENCE AND WHERE? Do the blossoms come and go As the waters ebb and flow? Or, as stars, the livelong year, Are they ever blooming here In a garden of delight, Clear or clouded to the sight As the Seasons o'er the land Lift or lower a wizard wand? THE WHISTLER 'Tis spring; but laid In ambuscade The Snow malignant lingers, And on the hill The March wind still At times must blow his fingers. THE DOVE The lone horizon listening seems to thee As to a soul beloved— Life's center, by the zone of destiny Forever far removed. THE DEATHLESS WIND Thou canst not die; for who can slay A spirit like to thee? Yet do we envy not thy stay When all things else that be Thy boon companions pass away, And perish utterly. And is it, restless Wanderer, The secret of the sigh That in thy gentlest moods we hear Or of the wailing cry When tempests fill thee with fear— To know thou canst not die? IN EXCELSIS To highest heaven the Lark alone Of earthly messengers is known; To Silence all things else above, He chants the litany of Love. OLD AND NEW Ever old and ever new, Else it never could be true. Failing leaf and falling snow, Budding germ and blossom glow, Tell us of a dream come true— Ever old and ever new. “SWEET TO THE SWEET” What say the flowers above Ophelia's tomb? “We bloom to fade; she faded but to bloom.” THE BIOLOGIST I seek the poles of Being; but the breath of icy death That bans the sailor from the utmost sea Still baffles me. What if the flash of naked knowledge blind The dazzled mind? What if beyond it depths unfathomed be Of mystery— Of limitless intelligence, that man, Alert to scan, Must headlong to annihilation fall, Or grasp the All? What then? Of what alone I'd compassed none But mine—the One, Omniscent, Omnipotent—could be The Sovereignty. A PRESENCE As on the lids of slumber lies a dream, Or fragrance on the petals of a flower, Or on the bosom of the deep, a beam At twilight's nuptial hour, So with me, in the soul of Silence, thou Abidest now. A SONG OF EXPECTANCY Time will tell us: only wait; He alone the secret knows, He alone the Delphic gate Shuts, or open throws. Time will tell us: kind is he; Sorrow wins not by delay, But the wine of joy to be Ripens day by day. LOSS AND GAIN “Behold Thy Mother! 'Tis the loss Of heaven, the load of shame, The sweat of agony, the cross, That ratifies thy claim.” He heard; and for the tender name, A Babe to Bethlehem He came. MOUNTAINEERS They climb with eager feet, One east, one west, As if in haste to meet Upon the crest; Yet each alone— A fate unknown— Nor deeming one, if either fails, how far Or near they are. SNOWDROP The white lips just above the ground Where sleeps my latest-born, I found; And, kneeling for the sleeper's sake, I kissed the blossom just awake. “PEACE!” A little warbler dead— A muted melody Of dimpled-notes that spread Like circles on the sea: One whispered word to chill The panting bosom warm, And suddenly to still The passion of the storm. ROOFLESS O Winter-Wind, behold, You call no more in vain, As in the nights of old, When door and window-pane Were barred against you and the cold That followed in your train. Come in; for I have known You now this many a year; And dying thus alone, 'Tis sweet again to hear A voice familiar as my own, The latest in my ear. THE OMEN He crept behind me, and his gentle hand Laid on my lids, lest I too soon should see The face in all the world most dear to me. The meaning then I did not understand. But now that he is vanished, I have guessed The import of the far foreshadowed sign: For closer than was his the hand Divine Is tenderly upon mine eyelids pressed. NIAGARA On Regan and on Goneril— The rugged rocks below— He pours as from the mouth of hell The torrent of his woe; While o'er him, with protecting hands, Cordelia—the rainbow—stands. RUTS I count the wrinkles in the road, As men are wont to trace The ravages of Time and Thought Upon a human face. Such are the vestiges of feet That day by day appear, And such of sightless memories Whose track alone is here. TRANSPLANTED No seed of Joy within us lies. So, if our souls the blossom bear, It is a flower of Paradise That Love has planted there. And in its vanished light we trace A halo of the sunset skies; A fragrance in the holy place Survives the sacrifice. SHAKESPEARE'S KEY “Unlocked his heart?” Not he! Of thine the cunning key He keeps, to open still And enter at his will. BETWEEN Beneath the dome of Yesterday, My buried Self I see— Of Time a portion passed away, And nevermore to be. Beneath lo, morrow's dome, a breath Of unawakened Morn, I wait nativity—of Death Or Life a babe unborn. EYES Sweet spirits born together To dwell in orbs apart, And feel the changeful weather That clouds or clears the Heart; Ye see not one the other, But in the smile or tear That makes of both a mother Each knows a sister near. MY SONG I go; but thou, my Song, Shall live as long As Tongue and fervid Heart Life's passion-power impart. Henceforth, of Love and thee Eternal Harmony Makes one; nor Time nor Death The soul-chord sundereth. MY TRUANT I bade him sleep, and he obeyed; But when I called him back to pain Within the slumber-world he stayed And would not wake again. LOVE'S USURY I love you; and because you do not love, I am the poorer and the richer, too; The poorer, for you've taken all whereof I gave; the richer, for enriching you. “WRIT IN WATER” E'en so; and where the fountain flows along, Unsatisfied, the burning lips of Love (Each passion growing with the taste thereof) Drink, as of wine, the torrent of thy song. SEPARATION “Till Death do us part, Ever one to remain,” To the new-plighted heart Was a whisper of pain: For the soul cannot die; And the life that is fled Waits, bewidowed as I, Until Death us do wed. TO SLEEP O tender Mother, blind and dumb, Who dost to all thy children come When others flee— Like Mary at the cross to stay E'en when our Father turns away, Come now to me! WILTED Little blossom, thou and I Both were born alike to die. Less of time allowed to thee; Haply, more Eternity. VAPORS In silence from the earth we rise To learn the language of the skies; Then, brimmed with music, melt again, In soft soliloquies of rain, To wake the seed-land slumbering deep, And soothe the laborer to sleep. ASPIRATION Make me, O Cloud, thy comrade! Let me be As thou, the silent Sister of the Wind; The nursling of the Sun and of the Sea; A shade of Earth in light celestial shrined. IN BANISHMENT Though from the waking world withdrawn, Night's boundary to keep, Thou floodest with a softer dawn The hemisphere of Sleep. BEETHOVEN (DEAF) So, he who Samson-like of sound Hath wrought our captive chains In everlasting silence bound A prisoner remains. CONTACT The universe is but the lordly hem Of God's out-flowing garment; and to them That touch in faith, its mysteries reveal A sacrament each mortal wound to heal. THE FIRST DREAMER He woke to clasp the vision of his dream. A self from self divided, that apart— Twin banks begotten of the selfsame stream— Each might in God behold the other's heart. ENSHRINED Each soul a sunbeam in a shroud Of folding mist appears; Now touched with rainbows, like a cloud, And now dissolved in tears. EXPECTANCY An eagle on the summit—Hope and Fear, Alternate pinions, moving restlessly. O Distance, doth the better part appear Doubt, or fulfilment of the thing to be? LEAR'S FOOL “I'll go to bed at noon.” Ah, Fool, 'twas wisely said; For Sorrow ne'er too soon The requiem-call to bed. FULFILMENT Since that the unfulfilled desire of Shame Meets the full-measured blame, So must the prayer that missed the deed of Love Find recompense above. PRESENTIMENT In boreal calm thy spirit feels A far-off thunder roll; And through each tropic passion steals A current from the pole. “THROUGH THE SHARP HAWTHORNE BLOWS THE COLD WIND” O Wind, like raging Lear forlorn, Against the sharp opposing thorne Thou barest thy bosom, as in scorn Of hearts with lesser anguish torn. SCIENCE Like Martha, she, with question manifold, Pursues her daily round; Nor sees that Faith her sister, as of old, The better part has found. SLEEP A house of hands not builded like the sky, O'erbending, but unsullied by the sod— Where Guilt alike oblivious may lie With Innocence, beside the lamb of God. APRIL “How is it you are laughing, dear, With both your eyes a-twinkle? Alas, 'tis all too soon, I fear To let my little buds appear. But now each restless prisoner Attempts my foot to tickle, And once to laugh if I begin, They know I cannot keep them in.” “CROSSING THE BAR” No need, O weary traveller, To seek the ocean far; For here, whene'er the coast is clear, The schooners cross the bar. ABDUL'S CHANCES With 'leven, it were not surprising Should Abdul get another rising, Or with the bakers over there Or brewers, he should get a bier. IN THE CONFESSIONAL “Well, Pat, have you no more to say?” “That's all, yer Riverence, today; But with the help of Hiven, be sure Anither toime I'll tell ye more.” EUREKA I love, as when a boy, That note exultant of domestic joy, When, triumph won, The Hen, like Archimedes, proclaims, “I've found it! If ye doubt me, Dons and Dames, Come see what I have done.” AN INCONGRUITY As they have safely reached the Church, It seems a thing to smile at That, to direct them in the search, We had a Pounch-as Pilot. INCOME FROM GO-OUT A fellow with a gouty foot Was on a restless donkey put, At which he swore in vain; But soon he hired the donkey out, And what he got relieved the gout, For it ass-waged his pain. THE TIDES AT PANAMA “An effort gigantic,” Exclaims the Atlantic, “Is making, to wed us by force.” “Indeed, 'tis terrific,” Replies the Pacific, “But cannot we get a divorce? For Teddy Is ready To sanction an ocean Whose aim Is a claim To prevent Trust-promotion.” MY TROUBLE Alas! what shall I do? I have lost my nearest friend; He tender was and true, And faithful to the end. In sunshine and in shade He closer stuck to me Than handle to a blade, Or wax unto a bee. But he'll not come again, Nor know what I'm about, For when he gave me pain, The doctor cut him out. And sad it is to me That I can never tell If my appendix be In heaven or in hell. A FINE PENALTY He offered but a poor defence, That advocate of mine; And yet, despite the evidence, The penalty was fine. The greater mystery it is The more we think upon it, That 'tis the oldest style of Miss That wants the youngest bonnet. Nor is it levity of mind That leads to such selection, For 'tis the fruit we often find, Of much mature reflection. MAID OF ALGERIA There was an old maid of Algeria Whose lungs were but cells of bacteria; So she cut them both out, Exclaiming, no doubt, “It will be said that I died of Hysteria.” THE FRISKING LAMB Tho' gay its life, in fact and fable, In death its fate is lamb-on-table. A BRIEF PEDIGREE My mother was a Mare; My father was, alas, (It pains me to declare), A veritable Ass. With rare exceptions, as a rule, There're no descendants from a Mule— The simple reason why, no doubt, Some other families die out. A PIECE OF PRESUMPTION Asked a possum of a canner In his most seductive manner, “Can you take me in, old man?” He replied, “Possum, I can.” SEA-SICKNESS Her doctor advising, a victim of grippe Set out on a journey to Rome; But ere she reached Naples, she threw up her trip And returned by the next steamer home. D?D D. D. O. sioux, appeal to you? And D. D. favor win? In D. D. D. appeal; and we Politely took him in. SONG OF THE SIOUX O'Gorman comes! Your knives unsheathe, To slice so sweet an appetiser! Kindle the fire! and whet your teeth! And be each a man a Gormandiser! “Dr. O'Gorman, of the Catholic University, has just been appointed Bishop of Sioux Falls; hence this letter.” DEFIANCE Tho' the modern woman pants To disguise her gender, Yet no fear my spirits haunts Lest I should offend her. Vain it were indeed to hiss— Vainer still to chide her; The hit offends her, and the Miss Makes the breeeches wider. JOB-PRINTING “Job-Printing!” I suspected so, For none was ever half so slow But Job, who by the gift he had Of patience drove the devil mad. APPENDIX III. UNPUBLISHED POEMS OF THE CONNOR MANUSCRIPT THE TREE Thou art the blessed Tree Whose fruit proclaimeth thee, O Mother mine! For never laden bough Such burden bore as thou, O Love Divine. MY STEWARDSHIP Lord, what Thou lendest me is Thine; Nor less beneath Thy care, For that Thy bounty makes it mine Love's heritage to share. DREAMS Our dreams but tell the thoughts of those Around us; e'en as water shows The images upon it thrown In lights and shadows not its own. THE ACORN Of myriads, but one hath found The sesame that opes the ground, And shows the hidden treasury Of all the wealth that makes a tree. (THE MESSAGE OF THE GRASS) Give me Thyself to see In what is least to me: That as I pass Each blade of grass That points above May cry aloud, “O Love, The light is Thine alone, The shadows all my own.” THE TREE To me the trembling Adam fled in shame From God's avenging eye; To me the Christ, a sinless victim, came For Adam's guilt to die. TO THE NEW MOON Thou lookest on the lonely place, To find no more the sleeping face, Nor kiss again the crescent brow— Thy fairer counterpart till now. SEPARATION To leave what most we love, in loneliness, To know our absence in some heart will make E'en love itself a sorrow for our sake— Ah, whose the weight of heavier distress? LINES As the petals fall away Briefer grows the autumn day; When the blossoms come again, Longer will the light remain. EGLANTINE Sweet Eglantine, this breath of thine— Mute eloquence of what was mine— Awakes a memory divine, A vanished gleam Of Joy, that in my heart today, Amid the folding shadows gray, Doth lie, as erst in light it lay, A fragrant dream. SECOND CHILDHOOD Since such alone can of Thy kingdom be, A little child Thou comest unto me; Then whatsoe'er of second birth the pain, Make me, O Lord, a little child again. MATURITY Talk not of childhood's thoughtless joy! I would not be again a boy For all that boyhood brings; The callow fledgling in the nest Is not of birds supremely blest As he that soars and sings. DOMUS AUREA Behold the living “House of Prayer” Above the waves uplifted; where The Bird of heaven, no more to roam, Henceforth forever hath His home Within the maiden heart that heard And mothered God's Eternal Word. AN ALIEN I saw in heaven, the hovering wings beneath, A Shade unbanished by the Light above: What is thy name? “The messenger of Love— The friend of all who passed yon portal—Death.” WHEAT Christlike falls the golden grain; Christlike doth it rise again; Christlike, as our daily food, One with us in flesh and blood. THE SWORD OF SIMEON Blest be the sword that cleft her heart in twain! Else had the “pondered word” forever lain Within the temple of her soul concealed, Whose wound the thoughts of many a heart revealed: Yea, to the source from whence the waters flow The spear that smites the fountain-Rock must go. BONDAGE Cries Death, “O Man, thy liberty, What boots it! Low thou bowest the knee Subservient to masters three— Thy conquerors—Pain, Age, and Me. COBWEB A fairy canopy it seems, By magic fingers spread; Whence, suddenly, our vanished dreams At flush of morning, fled. “OMNIPOTENCE IN BONDS” Thou that couldst ne'er be bound Canst nevermore be free: So close about Thee wound Is our humanity. As well desert Thy Father's throne As Mary's Motherhood disown. THE ORIGIN OF TEARS When Eve, the twilight heavens to view, Her eyes, like twin-born violets blue, Upraised—the angel of the Dew Bestowed his blessing, ere he knew. TO A SON IN CHRIST Ye Angels, lo, an angel unto you, His Guardians, I commend. Behold him, white in baptismal dew, Nor blush to call him friend. LEAR'S FOOL A bird that twitters where storm-treachery Hath fanged the oak, whose nest-supporting limb, Death-smitten, droops compassionate for him As for its own unsceptered majesty. MORNING-GLORIES We blossom in the border land When pilgrim shadows strew The largess of a liberal hand, In glittering gems of dew. Too timorous our glances are The noonday watch to keep: The sisters of the twilight star, With him we wake or sleep. ALFRED TENNYSON The voice that late with music thrilled The world, in silence now is stilled. Or is our loss the larger gain Of worlds new-wakened to his strain? TENNYSON 'Twas fit that with the falling year He too should fall; That he, when Nature heeds, should hear The homeward call; That leaves autumnal o'er his bier Bespread the pall, For in their funeral train appear The thoughts of all. TOO LATE Sighed a poet when his fame After fifty winters came And the Editors were asking for his rhyme: Alas, I've lost my chance As a hero of romance, For I've lived just thirty years beyond the time! SIGNIFICANCE Nothing is vain: a stifled sigh Life's passion pang betrays: One glance of Love's prophetic eye Eternity surveys. SOLICITUDE No mother minds so tenderly Her babe, to mirror back its smiles, As moves the never-resting sea About a slumbering isle. BEYOND How many larks are soaring— How many voices loud— Their songs of praise outpouring Where distance, like a cloud, Is stretched above us for a screen Lest aught of heaven be heard or seen! Ah, should one note prevailing, A momentary glow, Love's meteor light out-trailing, Flash over us below, Thenceforth the music of a sigh Were earth's divinest melody. TOMORROW Upon thy face alone no trace Of Time, no touch of sorrow; No shade of night upon the light That floods thy soul, sweet Morrow. GARNERED The tints that fly the autumn leaves, The leaves that fly the tree, Anon the Wizard Winter weaves In blossoms yet to be. EXTORTION Amid the stores of Opulence, If Courtesy is scant, 'Twere cruel to exact from thence What would increase the want. LONELINESS Dead in the desert! with the great white moon Above him and around him wastes of sand, The seed of endless centuries, so soon Escaped the struggles of a nerveless hand. TO A DEAD THRUSH Though Silence shuts the gate of Song, I keep thereof the key, And hear thee warbling still among The groves of Memory. THE PHANTOM WRAITH When roars the wind and beats the rain, A face before my window-pane— A phantom of the storm—I see, My own benighted effigy. So, when the spirit shuddereth Before the mystery of Death Perchance the shadow there portrayed Is but its own reflected shade. ATTAR OF ROSES The wafture of a thousand flowers is here Concentrated from afar, As gleams of many a steadfast sister sphere Upon a wandering star. And every breath in sweet remembrance bears The blossom whence it came, As radiance, or genial warmth, declares The unextinguished flame. SELF-SACRIFICE Lo, all I have is Thine— My wealth, my poverty. Ne'er canst thou, Lord, resign Of Self so much to me: For, giving Thou hast more; But I, henceforth, am poor. THE MORNING STAR The latest beacon spark Upon the western way To guide thro' shallowing dark The silver sails of Day. DESMOS I am Thy captive; break Thou not my chain; Beyond my dungeon all is death to me. Here must my soul, Love's prisoner, remain; Bondage alone is life and liberty. BLIND Is then the light so near That seems so far to me? E'en so about us here All vanished joys may be. Time's chrysalis outgrown, The garments that they wore— Sight, smell, touch, taste, and tone— They heed them now no more; For deep to answering deep Calls through eternity, E'en as these tears I weep, Alas, but cannot see! THE WRAITH The mist commingled with her tears The while she watched his form— The hazard of her hopes and fears— Defy the threatening storm. And where he vanished from her eyes, Behold, his spirit brave, Defiant, in the fog's disguise, Forsakes the watery grave. WHERE ARMIES MET I heard the distant summons loud To battle, from the crested Cloud, The vaunting trumpet of the Gale, The rattling musketry of Hail, The sobbing of the Rain, and lo! The silence of the shrouding Snow. CHRIST THE MENDICANT A stranger, to his own He came; and one alone, Who knew not sin, His lowliness believed, And in her soul conceived To let Him in. He naked was, and she Of her humanity A garment wove: He hungered, and she gave What most His heart did crave— A mother's love. TRANSMISSION 'Tis one by one we come and go; 'Tis one by one we stand or fall; 'Tis one by one the All we know, And one by one He comes to all. THE GLEANER Lo, silence, like a roving bee Upon her daily round, To fill the hive of memory Despoils each blossom-sound, And winters, as the past devours Whate'er the present yields, The promise of immortal flowers For time's unfallowed fields. MY SERVANT If what unto the least I do, I do it unto thee, Then in the least, O Lord, I view Thy service unto me. DIVORCE Time was when Faith and Reason trod With wedded hands the ways of God, But now, Love's sacrament denied, What God hath joined doth Man divide. SNOWDROPS As a blossom of the light Drifted downward through the night, From the darkness far below Came her counterpart of snow. SACRIFICE The dusky mother of the rosy morn Dies at its birth, contented to depart; As sorrow from the precincts of the heart When, flushed with tears, the man-child joy is born. SUCCESSORS Says the Shadow to the Sun, “When the victory is done All the world that thou hast won Will be mine!” Says the Sun, “My banner bright May be folded for a night; But anon with broader light Shall it shine.” UNFETTERED The winds are wailing, and I cannot sleep; What would ye, wandering sisters? Free to go Where'er ye list, and yet no happier so Than in the limits of Life's dungeon-keep? MOLOKAI The heaven's clean space above it and around The one expanse whereon no stain can be; Soothing all else within an Eden bound Of tropic life but snow-clad leprosy. RESTORATION The light may cleave our kindred shades And banish us apart, But distance in the darkness fades And we are heart to heart. THE MATERNITY One through Mother Mary, we With Thy warm humanity; And through Thee, her only Son, With our heavenly Father one; Motherless the world above, Earth had closer claims of love. LIFE-SONG Breathe it must for ecstacy, Or a stifled blossom die: Aching silence overgrown Brings to birth the living tone Sap-like, evermore to be One with full-blown memory. THE RIVER How calm the silent sister of the sea! No ripple on her ever-moving breast; The glass of Time and of Eternity— Unending motion in unending rest. THE PASSION O Night, thou never canst forget The agony and the bloody sweat Whereof the mere remembrance yet Again makes all thy garments wet. AN ECHO “Keats! Keats!” From yonder bush The startled thrush This name repeats; As if he heard My thought, and fain Would greet again His brother-bird. APRIL For many a flower that sleeps The zephyrs sigh in vain, Till April, Christ-like, weeps And Lazarus lives again. THE WIZARD Spring-like Prospero through all the land Now waves again his magic wand, From Winter's long captivity To set the April-blossoms free. ON THE HEIGHTS On Pisgah each must stand, And in a fruitful land Afar descried, Behold with longing eyes Some promised Paradise Of bliss denied. And each on Calvary Upon his cross must be A sacrifice; Where, Christ-like, two between— For Life or Death unseen— The victim dies. THE WAY-SIDE TREE The loiterers in my shade of old Themselves are shadows now; Their bodies, mingled with the mold, Upbreathe to many a bough The leaves o'ershadowing today Some fellow-pilgrim on the way That leads him to the vision blest, The Holy Sepulchre of Rest. WORSHIPPERS The gift of utterance is ours, Love's service to proclaim; But in the fragrance of the flowers There breathes a purer flame. Abiding in their place of birth, They cleave unto the sod, In reverence, nearer unto earth; In lowliness, to God. LIGHT IN DARKNESS I saw thee once in waking light— A darkness now to me, Since 'tis alone in dreams of night That I may gaze on thee. TWO EPITAPHS “Love lingers here where Life has fled.” Where, Death, thy victory? “Life lingers here where Love is dead.” Then hail, O Death, to thee! HARVEST The powers of heaven plant the weed That man uproots to set his seed: So doth the God Incarnate plan Through Man to feed his fellow-man. NUNC ET SEMPER Am I awake? or do I dream? To me forever moving seem Alike the margin and the stream. I breathe; and lo, a whisper saith, “'Tis Life.” A silence answereth, As if in pity, “Nay, 'tis Death.” Alike the Future and the Past Proclaim, “We are but shadows cast Before and after, first and last. Between us thine eternal lot Is laid—a consecrated spot— Whereon we gaze, but enter not. Unpiloted—we know not how— Unto this new-discovered Now, We come, its guardians, as thou.” DEFLOWERED All the light of heaven In a single beam Unto earth was given, As a perfect dream, Wherein one bated breath Of ecstacy is Death. All of faith's believing In one smile of love; All of life's receiving In a frown thereof: For one frail flower the less, God's world a wilderness. A MEDITATION 'Tis Nothingness that sunders me, O God, from thine Eternity, Wherein, a being yet to be, I dwelt forever one with Thee, Till twixt Thee and thy living Thought This veil of Nothingness was wrought— A gulf thy Love alone could span— The mystery that made me Man. FAREWELL! “Farewell!” The fading day Still whispers, “Fare thee well. I go the darkened way Whence none returns to tell Of those that thither stray What fate befell.” THE WRECK Was it thy lord the sea That wrought this tragedy, A spouse to spurn? Or didst thou faithless prove And to thine ancient love, The land, return! The lesson of thy fate (Alas, for thee too late) In silence saith, “Once wedded to the main Unto the shore again To turn is Death.” DELUSION Thy presence woke me to the pain Of sympathies apart: Thy absence bids me dream again That we are one in heart. THE HOUR “Why weepest thou, O twilight gray, In unavailing sorrow?” “Alas, I've lost a yesterday And ne'er shall find a morrow. UNDER THE TREES (“Exultabunt omnia ligna sylvarum.”) As oft in wandering distress, Today in solemn thankfulness, Unto your God and mine I come with winnowings of prayer, O sinless suppliants, to share Your mysteries divine. TIME'S MEZZOTINT 'Tis in the shadows that we trace The light of Love's remembered face: 'Tis in the register of Pain That Life's immortal deeds remain. THE LARK'S FIAT How vast the ocean of the dark! How small the compass of the lark Whose “Fiat” from the void of night Awakes the new-created light. MATER DEI As Faith, a pilgrim, seeks the tomb Where once in Death's eclipsing gloom Her Hope o'erclouded lay; So Love unto the blessed womb Where slept her Life's unbudded bloom Would lowly reverence pay. THE CHRIST-LIKE SPRING Wherever thou dost come, The birds and fountains dumb Break forth in song; While groping blossoms blind Their sight and fragrance find To hail the throng, Exulting everywhere, Of palsied limbs and bare, Reclothed and strong. AN EASTER LILY In vain to seal the sepulchre The Pilate Death commands; For, lo, again his prisoner Within the garden stands. SLEEP Another Mary seemest thou to me— A rainbow span, Twixt life and death a miracle, as she Twixt God and Man. AFTER BEDTIME Little heads are sleeping all, While within the darkened hall Hang their hats upon the wall; Like the little hives arow, Where bee-fancies to and fro All day long do come and go. Some with pleasure, some with pain, Through the sunshine and the rain, Busy for the brooding brain. All is quiet now and rest; In each slumber-shaded breast Dreams have found another nest. BLESSED VIRGIN Why is the B. V. clad in Blue? Because when comes no cloud between My heart and Heaven above Then wears the firmament serene The livery of Love. A MIRACLE For each hen-turkey slain today To celebrate Thanksgiving, Full many a gobbler, strange to say, Is made among the living. RESTITUTION “Did you restore that mangy sow You stole from Pat McCarthy?” “Indade I did, and have her now; And she is fat and hearty.” POST MORTEM “When I am dead,” the poet said, “The world shall read my verses.” “Then better pray on earth to stay,” Said one, “and curb the curses.” SUI GENERIS He: “I'm not of Adam's lineage bred, And pedigree will show it.” She: “Ah, pity 'tis the old man's dead. 'Twould please him so to know it.” THE EPITAPH Not dead, but sleeping. So it read. Said Pat, when he was shown it, “I would, bedad, if I was dead, Be man enough to own it.” ODE TO A PASSION He slandered me; and I “with eyes of fire,” Like Collins' Anger, rose and struck the liar. “You do me wrong,” he muttered with surprise. “Then,” said I, “thus do I Apollo-gize.” APPENDIX IV. UNPUBLISHED POEMS FROM THE DONAHOE CLASS-BOOK CHRIST'S LITTLE SISTER Little Sister of the Poor, Asking alms from door to door, Ever on you go; Clothed in the garb of meekness, Finding strength in others' weakness, Soothing others' woe. Little Sister of the Poor, Rich in patience to endure Stern Redemption's load; Cold and rain and parching heat Hinder not heroic feet On the Royal Road. Little Sister of the Poor, When your weary day is o'er Rest there may not be; For the aged, sick, and needy Vigils claim and succor speedy, Turning unto thee. Little Sister of the Poor, Narrow is the way but sure, Heavenward leading on; For the Master's word thou knowest, “What unto the least thou doest Unto me is done.” THE BELLMAN He sits alone in the belfry, A feeble man and gray, And tolls the bell when its full notes tell Of the hours that glide away. In the mist of the early morning, In the glare of the garish noon, In the midnight deep when the shadows creep On the track of the waning moon, When the snow in the starlight glistens, When the flowers from their grave arise, When the faint airs swoon in the languid June When the dirge of autumn sighs. Like Time with the scythe uplifted He measures each silent spell, Sifting the sand with a tremulous hand, As he waits for the brooding knell. Each stroke has a double meaning A welcome and farewell— In a single breath a birth and death, A past and a future dwell. A groan and a peal of laughter, A tear of joy or of pain, A frown that breaks or a smile that wakes Sunshine in the heart again. Like a vane in the wind of Fortune Has the life of the bellman gone, For its changes have been as the shadow and sheen That stride over the waving corn. But his heart like the bell he tolleth Beats ever the selfsame tone, Saying all I have is the God's who gave; Let Him do as He will with His own. THE OUTCAST Dead! Found in the desolate street Where the drifting snow had silently piled As if in pity, poor wandering child, To mantle thee in its sheet. Pale e'en as thy covering pure Nor colder its touch than thy marble breast And the heart beneath in a dreamless rest That throbs to the tempest no more. Still fresh in the halo of morn! But love-blighted Innocence thrust away Prone on the gulf of its bitterness lay Aghast, unresisting, forlorn. Alas! For thee, dissolute man, Thy token her tapering finger bears; How the glittering mock of the bauble glares, Mid beauty so rigid and wan. Couldst thou gaze on thy victim again On the icy calm of her lineaments now, This pallid eclipse of the queenly brow Would smite thy voluptuous brain— Yet naught but forgiveness there. The dumb lips falter in suppliance meek, While a ringlet stirs on the ivory cheek As if with the breathing of prayer. Ah! Who hath her history known? The bleak world stifles the penitent's prayer; She turns from its withering scorn to die Homeless, unfriended, alone. O thou, in whose sheltering side Sweet refuge still for the lost remains Cleanse in thy pity her glittering stains, Her shame in thy chastity hide. A VISIT TO THE BLESSED SACRAMENT ON THE EVE OF THE EPIPHANY Now the dusky wing of twilight Hovers o'er the weary day, And the ever deeping shadows Slowly steal across our way. Here amid the solemn stillness And the gathering shades of night Sweet it is, O loving Jesu, Thee to seek, our fadeless Light! Yonder lamp before the altar Tells us of Thy presence there, As the wondrous Star of Bethlehem Did Thy dwelling place declare. And we bow in adoration As the Magi knelt of old, Offering Thee our humble tributes With their incense, myrrh, and gold. Grant us like those Kings of the Orient, Ever onward to proceed, Through all dangers, pain, and labor, Wheresoe'er Thy Light may lead; Till our earthly journey ended, We at last may rest with them, Where no shadow veils Thy glory, In the heavenly Bethlehem. ADIEU The leaves upon the summer tree Hang side by side, But winter's breath will scatter them All far and wide. E'en thus, together have our lots been cast, And so for us the parting comes at last. But He who clothes the summer tree Or makes it bare, Lets not the frailest blossom fall Without His care. So, ever 'neath His guiding hand, may we Together or apart, safe, sheltered be.</field>
