But she did not watch for the boat on the tide, With the black nets dragging over the side, And the silver herrings laden. The waves lay quiet about her feet, And she made the weed-strewn beach so sweet, Both she and her song together; The two little shoulders out of her gown Peeping timid, and rosy-brown As her Glenfern hills of heather. All out of the West the scarlet fell, And the gold and the gray like a chasuble, On the moaning and dark Lochmarlie, And over the red and the gold and gray The song from the young mouth rippled away, And the glad refrain was Charley! No sounds were heard but the fisher's oar, As his boat came scudding in to the shore, Her nets like a black veil wearing, And his shout, as he lightly leaped to the land; But what to the maiden there on the sand Was the prize of silver herring! She hid her shoulders deep in her gown, And dropt her careless eyelids down To the water of dark Lochmarlie; And over the fisher and nets and all Her song went on like the beach-bird's call, And the wild refrain was Charley! Slow the night came over the dew, But never a sail the mist breaks throughâ âSweetheart, can you thus dissemble?â And fainter and fainter the love-song grows, Till it breaks as the raindrops break in the rose To a soft and soundless tremble. Now all is still as still can be, And the bell strikes one, and two, and three, And the morning, whitening over, Casts the moon in the sea like a ring, Which a maid might out of her window fling To her mad and moaning lover. The strong-armed fisher comes to the shore, And heads his slighted boat once more Where the silver prize is lying; But it seems to him that the wild green wave Turns as the grass turns over a grave, And his wrecked heart fills with sighing. 'Tis many a year since the maiden's lay, With the gold and the scarlet, died away From the water of dark Lochmarlie; But still with the night do the tides return To the heathery hills of wild Glenfern With the wail of Charley! Charley! THE BETROTHED. I have acted as they have bid me, he said that he was blest, And the sweet seal of betrothal on my forehead has been prest; But my heart gave back no echo to the rapture of his bliss, And the hand he clasped so fondly was less tremulous than his. They praise his lordly beauty, and I know that he is fair, Oh, I always loved the color of his sunny eyes and hair! And though my bosom may have held a happier heart than now, I have told him that I love him, and I must not break the vow. He called me the fair lady of a castle o'er the seas, And I thought about a cottage nestled in among the trees; And when my cheek beneath his lip burned not, nor turned aside, I thought how once a lighter kiss had left it crimson-dyed. What care I for the wind-harps breathing low among the vines, I better love the swinging of the sleety mountain pines; And to track the timid rabbit in the snow-shower, as I list, Than to ride his coal-black hunter with the hawk upon my wrist. And I fain would give the grandeur of the oaken-shadowed lawns, And the dimly-stretching forest where the red roe leads her fawns, To gather the thistle and the fennel's yellow bloom, Where frowning turrets cumber not the path with gorgeous gloom. Let them wreathe the bridal roses with my tresses as they may; There are phantoms in my bosom that cannot keep away; To my heart, as to a banquet, they are crowding, pale and dread, But I told him that I loved him, and it cannot be unsaid. THE WIFE OF LUMLEY MOORE. Have you not seen her many a day, Leaning out of her door, List'ning and looking far awayâ The wife of Lumley Moore? The leaves of the rooftree, thick and dim, Trembling through and through, And little birds with necks stretched slim, As if they listened too? Have you not seen the air a-hush And tender with her praise, And the squirrel hide in his hazel-bush Ashamed of his clumsy ways? Her timid glances all alert, As if her peace was gone, And her step as light as she feared to hurt The grass she trod upon? Have you not heard her piteous sighs That reached to other years, And seen the light of her sweet, sweet eyes Going out in tears? Poor lady! when at midnight dark The death-watch beats his drum, She turns no more in her bed, to hark For feet that do not come. The brier its thorny arms all wide Has thrown across her door, And the lizard slips where lived and died The wife of Lumley Moore. THE PEASANT PAVO. A STORY FROM THE SWEDISH. On a sterile farm in the northland The peasant Pavo lived, And for seven sweet years together His crops and his cattle thrived; For he wrought with a hand untiring, And wrought with a heart at peace, And the merciful Lord and Master Gave back the good increase. His boys were rathe and ruddy, And his girls as fair as the morn, With hair as bright as the yellow light In the ears of harvest corn. And Pavo's wife was comely, And she never stayed to sigh, But spun at the wheel, and ground the meal, And baked the cakes of rye. The high bleak moors were alway With Pavo's furrows crossed, And white as snow in the reeds below The horns of his cattle tossed. So seven sweet years together The prosperous sheaves were bound, And then the sliding snow-drifts They froze the seed in the ground. âGood man, good man!â cries Pavo's wife, âOur work no more God speeds, And the silver horns of our cattle They are drooping under the reeds; And the heads of our darling children They are drooping too,â she said. âTake staff and away, good man, I pray, Or else we shall starve for bread!â âNay, nay!â said the peasant Pavo, âLet us better courage take; God tryeth the trust of his servant, But he will not all forsake! So sing, good wife, at the cradle, And sing at the distaff still, And henceforth, mark, put half of bark And half of rye, in the mill! âFor me, I will set my furrow Down deeper by half, nor cease To break in the morn my cake of corn And bark, in the sweetest peace.â And the hand of the wife, like a lily, It fluttered against the pane, To beck him away from his plow that day, But all and all in vain. He digged between the snow-drifts, And harrowed the sweet seed down, Till all the high, bleak moorlands Were green instead of brown. But the sleet and the hail descended All bitter and sharp one day, And cut from the fair young corn-stalks The tender ears away. Then Pavo's wife fell fretting, And would not be at peace; âYou have sowed,â she said, âbut where is the bread? God giveth us no increase! I tell you, man, there hath fallen A curse on the plow this day; So let it stand and rust in the land, And take your staff and away!â âNay, nay!â said the patient Pavo, âGod doth but his servant try;â And his lambs he sold from out their fold, And bought him seeds of rye. And set his plow yet deeper, And deeper harrowed the grain, And the high, bleak moorlands blossomed With a living green again. And the gracious Lord and Master He blessed the tireless hand, And all like a yellow sunset The harvest shone in the land; And the wife of the peasant Pavo Her cheeks they burned like flame, And she bound her sheaves with willow-leaves, In token of her shame. MARY AND THE MILLER. âWhat are you thinking of, Mary? Wilful and wise little Maryâ Tell me, my sly little fairy, What are you thinking of now?â âOf my new Easter dress In the rose-scented pressâ Of that, and my little brown cow!â âWhat are you looking at, Mary? Glad little golden-haired Mary, Tell me, my sunshiny fairy, What are you looking at now?â âAt a poor silly moth I took out o' the froth Of the milking-pail, mother, I vow!â âWhat are you harking to, Mary? Dear little dewy-eyed Maryâ What do you hark to, my fairy, With such a wild, wondering look?â âTo the breeze on the hill, mother, Not to the mill, motherâ Not to the mill by the brook!â âWhy are you sighing so, Mary? Poor little, pale little Maryâ And is it about the young fairy The miller has married but now?â âIt is not for her ringâ That is no such great thingâ There are six on the horn of my cow!â âWhy are you weeping so, Mary? Sad little, sweet little Maryâ Sad little, sick little Mary, Why are you weeping so, dear?â âOh, I think I shall die! If I do, let me lie Where the mill-stream will sing all the year.â PIERRE RAVENAL. Among the rocks and glaciers, Where the summer never came, There lived, one time, a hunterâ Pierre Ravenal by name. He had a hut in the mountain, And a little red-cheeked wife, But to chase and kill the chamois Was the pleasure of his life. And he did not love his fireside, Nor love the milk of his goats, Nor love his cloak of camel-cloth, As he loved their silken coats. His eye was all undazzled By the plume of the rarest bird, If he happed to cross in the snow-fields The trail of a chamois herd. One day, when over the glacier The wind blew bitter and chill, Pierre Ravenal shouldered his carbine, And tramped away with a will. And the good little wife by the chimney She carded her flaxen wisp, And left the quarter of rabbit To broil on the coals to a crisp. Ah! what was the blazing fagot, And what was the savory meat, When Pierre, her hunter and husband, Was off in the freezing sleet! But he loved to chase the chamois As well as he loved his life, Nor ever dreamed of the trouble In the heart of the good little wife. So, while she sat by the chimney, And carded a shirt for her Pierre, He laughed to himself, and shouted, For the grandest luck of the year. He had chased a herd of chamois Up, up through the jagged blocks, To the ledge where they fell sheer downward, Four hundred feet of rocks! When all at once, beside him, A dwarf, with a hand of ice, Stood close, and clutched and held him, As if with an iron vice. Oh, never was seen a monster So black, and of shape so ill; And the tones of his speech they grated Like stones that are crunched in a mill. And his beard it shook and rattled Like withered reeds in a storm, As he held poor Pierre, head foremost, By all the length of his arm; And backward and forward swung him, With his ugly face in a frown, As if he were ready to dash him Four hundred feet sheer down. âI've caught you killing my chamois!â He cried, âas I knew I should; And you, for the sake of justice, Shall give back blood for blood!ââ âHave mercy, oh, have mercy! Good King of the Dwarfs,â cried Pierre, âFor the sake of my starving children,â For the sake of my wife, so dear! âThey are faint with cold and hunger, In our poor hut under the snow,â Good King of the Dwarfs, have mercy, And for love's sake, let me go!ââ And the heart of the monster softened When he heard the piteous call, And he dragged the hunter in across The jagged top of the wall. âGo back!â he said, as he crushed him All up in his arm, like a sheaf, âGo back to your hut; but I tell you, You are none the less a thief!â And then the dwarf, still growling, Dropt down upon his knees, And digged from under the snow-cakes A golden-rinded cheese. âTake this to your wife and children, And by my kingly grace, Whenever they eat a mouthful, Another shall come in its place; But only just so long,â he said, âAs you hold your honor good; For if I catch you here again, I will have back blood for blood!â Then Pierre took up his carbine, Saying, âStand our bargain so!â And buttoned the cheese beneath his coat, And tramped across the snow. And seven long years together His good little wife and he Lived in their hut by the mountain side, As happy as they could be. And still, as they ate their supper Of cheese, and went to bed, The golden rind grew whole again, The same as the dwarf had said. And what with the cup of goat's milk, And the Alpine flower or two Sold now and then to a traveller, They were well enough to do. But the little wife had all the while A thorn in her bosom hid, For Pierre would keep his carbine bright, Whatever else he did. âTo scour the lock so often, It is a foolish thing to do!â She would say, because in secret She feared the worst was true. One day, as by the chimney She sat at her wheel and sung, With her face away from the rafter Where the polished carbine hung, Pierre Ravenal slipt it lightly From off the beam so low, And with it slung on his shoulder Went tramping through the snow. And when a herd of chamois Before him leaped and ran, He straight forgot the bargain With the dwarfish little man, And scurried over the snow-fields, And up and up the blocks Of steel-blue ice, till he stood again By the awful wall of rocks. Then all at once the monster, With a hand so strong and brown, Doubled him up, and dashed him Four hundred feet sheer down! And still about the ink-black pool, Where he lost his life that day, You may see him spinning round and round, Like the wheel of his wife, they say. And she, poor soul, when she missed him, Snapt straight her song in twain, And never in all her lifetime Could join it on again. For she knew when she brought her cheese-cake To end her week of fast, By the golden rind still broken, That her fears were true at last. THE LAST VOYAGE. At shut of day they sat and talked, In their old house by the sea; The weather-beaten Solomon, And his good wife Marsalee. âThe sun looks like a ship,â he said, âThat is nearly come to land; That slanting beam, like a plank pushed out To take aboard some hand.â And when at length the gold-backed clouds Crouched in the dark, from view, He said, âIt will be a stormy night; May the good ship weather through!â At last the old wife Marsalee Could win no answering word; The ship was gone, the plank hauled in, And Solomon was aboard. WORLDLY WISE. It was the boatman Ronsalee, And he sailed through the mists so white, And two little ladies sat at his knee, With their two little heads so bright; And so they sailed and sailedâall threeâ On the golden coast o' the night. Young Ronsalee had a handsome face, And his great beard made him brown; And the two little ladies in girlish grace They kept their eyelids downâ The one in her silken veil of lace, And the one in her woolsey gown. For one little lady lived in the wood, Like a flower that hides from the day; Her name was Jennyâthey called her the good, And the name of the other was May; And her palace window looked on the flood Where they softly sailed away. Long time the balance even stood With our Ronsalee that day; But what was a little house in the wood To a palace grand and gay? So he gave his heart to Jenny the good, And his hand he gave to May. THE HUNTER'S WIFE. 'T was all through the roses, so ripe and so red, And all when the summer was shining her best, That Lindsey, my lover, rode into the West, The land of the prairie, a-hunting to go For the fawn and the pheasant, the dove and the doeâ 'T was all through the roses, and roses are dead. I look from the porch-side and dream, as I must, Of the time when I pulled the green grape-leaves apart, As Lindsey, my lover, my sweet, sweetest heart, Rode into the shadow, and out of my sightâ Ah! never a day-dawn has broke on that night, And all the green grape-leaves are dry as the dust. He sat in his saddle, so bright and so braveâ The dint of his hoof-strokes along the wolf's track I followed and followedâI could not stay back! O Lindsey, my lover, my hunter, my friend, I would I had followed thee on to the endâ Into wilderness places, ay, into the grave. In the way of his riding the rough rushes fell, And the fox in his covert all timidly bayed, And the eagle rose, flapping his broad wings afraid, For the gun on his shoulder hung polished and bright, And the knife at his girdle flashed out like a light, And the bit at his bridle, it rung like a bell. 'T was all through the roses, and when the year stood At the sunset, and shone in the gold-colored leaves, And thin, like a sickle that hangs among sheaves, The moon of the autumn looked out of the mist, The brows of my babes for their father I kissed, And kept up a truce with my heart, as I could. 'T was all through the roses, and when they were dead, And the rain slanted slow from the clouds all the day, And my dogs in the warmth of my chimney-logs lay; And while of a-shiver, with horn upon horn, My cattle crouched under the broad-bladed corn, Thou still hast some roof-tree, O lost love! I said. Hush, darlings, oh, hush! he will come back again When only a day or a night has gone by! And I rocked them asleep to the kingfisher's cry, The starling's wild clatter, the call of the quail, And the beat upon beat of the pioneer's flail; But I promised and pacified, all, all in vain. At last, when the lonesome lament of the loon Began to be heard, while the frost, sharp and cold, Was cutting his harvest of scarlet and gold, And when in the prairie-grass, fallen and dead, The wings of the starlings no longer shone red, My lullaby fell to a mournfuller tune. Then fear came upon me, and day after day I lingered, in visions, his camp-grounds aboutâ The game-pots were steamless, the fires all were out; The tent-poles a-tumble, and ready to fall, That held the rough buffalo-hide for a wall, And the black-snake lay under the fagots and hay. Like dry sands my hearth-stones slid under my feet, As I sat with just only my door-planks between My babes and the panther so lithe and so lean, And with only the blaze of the clearing to scare The hungry and horrible eyes of the bear,â And so came the winter in harness of sleet. And now, as the wind ploughs the furrows so white Across the long prairie, I cannot but cryâ My stables are littered with oat-straw and rye, The breath of my cattle makes warmth in the cold, My dogs are in kennel, my sheep are in fold, But where lies my Lindsey, my lover, to-night? Again and again from my pillow I start, And feel down the wolf-skin that covers the beds Of my darlings, and drag to my bosom their heads, As under my windows, now to and now fro, I hear the wild catamount stealthily goâ The blood all a-curdle and cold in my heart. Yet sometimes a sweet vision blesses my eyes: I see a gay huntsman ride over the snow, And I blush, for the gifts at his girdle I know: The red combs of cocks, and the antlers as clear And white as the ivory, are gifts for his dear, And I call to my darlings, Awake, and arise! I call at my perilâthe dream groweth dimâ The combs red as roses, the white antlers pass; And I see but the lift of the long prairie grass, And hear but the whimper and moan of unrest From the swollen and snag-slivered streams of the West, But there cometh no news, and no tidings of him. O women who sit while the winter winds rave, And mourn for the husbands and lovers so low Beneath the wild drifts of the leaves and the snow,â Remember, while grief in its fountain thus stirs, Your burden is lighter to bear than is hers Who mourns for her dead that had never a grave. O women whose hands, when the winter has fled, Shall pluck off the roses and strew them so deep O'er the beds where your dearly-beloved ones sleep, The while in your desolate darkness you pine,â Remember your sorrow is lighter than mine Who know not, nor can know, the place of my dead. SYLVIA. Lone among the evening shades, Brown and purple, red and gray, Went the tender Sylvia, Fairest of the rustic maids, Driving home her pastured cows: Close along the drooping boughs Of a black, enchanted grove, Went she, dreaming dreams of love, Dreaming dreams about a lover,â Went she, treading down the clover, Ivy buds and daisies fair, And wild violets, unaware,â Went she, slowly, with her cows, Treading through the round red clover. Ah, to see her thoughtful brows, And her sweet mouth, was to love her! In the black, enchanted grove Lived a spirit dressed with clay, And to see her was to love; So he sang a herdsman's lay, Bringing all her cows that way. Of their meeting, if they met, Not a word the story tells,â But of days in clouds that set, And of winds in gusty swells Driving madly every way,â And of cattle gone astray In the rainy woods; of skies Shutting all their golden eyes; And of moanings in the air, That did seem, the story says, For some lost soulâlet us pray That it was not Sylvia's. BALLAD. FROM THE SCLAVIC. All in the early morning The Sclavic maid so fair Arose at her mother's calling, And combed her yellow hair; And laced with silken ribbons Her bodice of leaf-green, And tript adown the mountain path The frosty reeds between. And while the rough winds kissed her, She knelt at the fountain's brink, But the ice was frozen all across, And her pitcher would not sink. Ah! then she fell a-weeping, And her red mouth trembled white, For she feared her mother's cruel eyes, As well indeed she might. âCome, sun!â she cried through her sobbing, âCome out of the clouds so brown, And lick the ice with your golden tongue, And let my pitcher down! âO eagle, strong-winged eagle, Come out of the skies so blue, And split the ice with your horny beak, And let my pitcher through!â But the sun, for all her sobbing, Came not through the clouds so brown, To lick the ice with his golden tongue, And let her pitcher down. And the eagle, proudly soaring, Came not from his home so blue, To make a wedge of his horny beak, And split the ice in two. Ah! then in the early morning A piteous sight was seenâ Her tears all frozen into pearls, Along her bodice green. For, lo! betwixt the stiff black reeds, Adown the mountain path, She heard her mother calling In her foolish woman's wrath: âOh, wilful, stubborn daughter, Since thou idlest all the day, I would the winds might beat thee, And take thy breath away! âYea, beat and break and crush thee, Since thou art so high and proud, And I would the needles of the frost Might sew thee in a shroud!â Alas for the wicked woman, Little dreamed she in that hour That a word may be, for good or ill, Omnipotent in power. And alas for the Sclavic maiden, She turned her east and south, And her heart it fluttered into her throat, And fluttered out of her mouth. The winds they fell to beating her, And she knew not where to flee, And, to 'scape from her mother's cruel eyes, She hid in a maple-tree. And in its time of blooming, That tree grew strangely fairâ Its leaves like the maiden's bodice green, And its blossoms like her hair. But still, as the sunshine gilded Its head, so brave and high, There shivered through its branches old A dull and dolorous cry. One day, as it chanced, there rested Two lads in its pleasant shade, And they were the minstrel brothers Of the little Sclavic maid. And, lo! as they played a merry tune They each grew heavy at heart, And the wood of their viols all at once It brake and snapt apart. Then cried they both: âThis maple Is the best that e'er we saw. Oh, wouldn't it make us fiddle-sticks Right silver-sweet to draw!â And straight they fetched an axe and set Its sharp edge in the wood, And all in a spout the sap came out, And ran as red as blood; While all the body of the tree It trembled low and high, And all the tender branches made A dull and dolorous cry. And when it fell beneath their strokes, And lay along the land, The touch of every leaf was like Some gentle little hand. But, ah! the saddest part of all My tale is yet to tell: For when from out the viol strings At last the music fell, The mother's cold and cruel heart Grew wild with pain and fearâ She knew it was her daughter's voice That sounded in her ear. And, as the maple-tree had done, She fell to rise no more, But prostrate lay, and so became The door-stone of her door. SECOND SIGHT. Little lass of Dalnacardoch, Carding wool of Dalnacardoch, Oh, the dreams that lie about her, Full of light, and over full, Like the clouds in golden weather, While she sits and smites together The two cards that tear the tangles From her fleece of heathland wool. Slyest lass of Dalnacardoch, Shyest lass of Dalnacardoch! Oh, I know your pretty secret, And ye have no need to speak; 'T is your thoughts about a lover That are running in and overâ Running sadly in and over That dear dimple of your cheek. As the lily in the water Swims up softly through the water, Giving forth her folded sweetness When the sun is in the skies, So from out its place of hiding Comes your heart up at the bidding Of the bold audacious glances That he sends you from his eyes. In the harvest of the barley 'T was the sheaf of Nichol Marley That was tied with gay green ribbons All untwisted from bright hair, While the moon, so fair and fickle, Like a dagger, not a sickle, Struck down sharply through the mist-cloud, Lying swarth-like on the air. Oh, the broom that waved so yellow O'er the heathlands, now is sallow, Oh, the grass as green 's a ribbon. Now is withered, wild, and gray; And the sheared sheep then incloses, With their backs as pink as roses, Loose among the dry black nettles And the rough-leaved thistles stray. Oh, the lass of Dalnacardoch, Woe, the lass of Dalnacardoch, Still her gold-dreams lie about her, And she lives in sweet belief That the heath with bloom is shining, And the grass as green 's the twining Of the fortune-witching ribbon Twisted in with Nichol's sheaf. He is hunting on high Rannochâ On the heathery moor of Rannoch, By the brave Loch-Ericht eagle, Driving blindly toward his nest; True to nature, onward, sunward, With a broken leg dragged downward, And a clot of wet, red feathers, Growing sodden in his breast. 'T is his rifle-shots thick flying, By the screaming and the crying Of the patriarchal ravens Sailing stately, far and near, And by faintly outlined doubles Moistened red along the stubbles, Where in one bed, both together, Death o'ertook them, doe and deer. Fearless lass of Dalnacardoch, Tearless lass of Dalnacardoch, Tease the tangles from the tanglesâ Comb and card your fleeces white With your heart as light 's a feather, And your dreams like golden weather, And God save ye, little lassie, Save ye from a second sight! CHARLEY'S DEATH. The wind got up moaning, and blew to a breeze; I sat with my face closely pressed on the pane; In a minute or two it began to rain, And put out the sunset-fire in the trees. In the clouds' black faces broke out dismay That ran of a sudden up half the sky, And the team, cutting ruts in the grass, went by, Heavy and dripping with sweet wet hay. Clutching the straws out and knitting his brow, Walked Arthur beside it, unsteady of limb; I stood up in wonder, for, following him, Charley was used to be;âwhere was he now? â'T is like him,â I said, âto be working thus late!ââ I said it, but did not believe it was so; He could not have staid in the meadow to mow, With rain coming down at so dismal a rate. âHe 's bringing the cows home.ââI choked at that lie: They were huddled close by in a tumult and fret,â Some pawing the dry dust up out of the wet, Some looking afield with their heads lifted high. O'er the run, o'er the hilltop, and on through the gloom My vision ran quick as the lightning could dart; All at once the blood shocked and stood still in my heart;â He was coming as never till then he had come! Borne 'twixt our four work-hands, I saw through the fall Of the rain, and the shadows so thick and so dim, They had taken their coats off and spread them on him, And that he was lying out straight,âthat was all!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">POEMS OF THOUGHT AND FEELING. COMING. They are mustering, they are marchingâ Hark, how their tramping rolls! They are coming, coming, coming! A hundred thousand souls! From the granite hills, the seaside, In solid ranks like walls, A thousand men to take the place Of every man that falls! Right on across the midnight, Right onward, stern and proud, Their red flags shining as they come Like morning on a cloud. Battalion on battalion The West its bravery pours, For the colors God's own hand has set In the bushes at their doors! In the woods and in the clearings, Our lovers, brothers, sons, Our young men, and our old men Are shouldering their guns. They have heard the bugle blowingâ Heard the thunder of the drum, And farther than the eye can see They come, and come, and come! A LESSON. âWeep no more, lady, weep no more, Thy sorrow is in vain, For violets plucked, the fairest showers Will not make grow again.â Percy's Reliques. Idly in my house I lay, Waiting still for joys unearned, Till it came about one day That a lesson thus I learned. âListless lady, will you walk?â Quick I turned my face aboutâ âAll ablush upon one stalk, Three sweet roses have come out!â Quick I turned; my gardener stood With his eager eyes on mine; âThree,â he said, âas red as blood; Will you see them where they shine? âSuch sweet things were never born! Lady, will you come and see?â Then I answered, with slow scorn: âBring them hither, from the tree!â Off from mine he took his eyesâ âI obey your cold commands, Asking this, for you are wise: Will they bloom in your white hands?â Faint in heart, and sick in head, Seeing dark as through a glass,â âWhat is that to you?â I said; âGo, and bring my will to pass!â Down the stair I heard his sighs, Low and low and lower fall; âI am dull, and she is wise; But they will not bloom, for all! âEarth is hard and earth is brown, And the rains they coldly fall; White the hands and soft as down; But they will not bloom, for all! âNature she is very wise, And so faithful to her ways, That no sinful, selfish sighs Ever change herâGod have praise! âVery wise and very still, Never bought and never sold, At her own sweet time and will Giving scarlet, white or gold. âNever any idle pause, Never any noisy stir; But if we reject her laws, All the worse for us, not her! âO my roses, fair and bright,â Through the garden gate he sighed, âMay it prove that through your blight Wisdom shall be justified. âI would spare you if I could!â Sighing down the garden walk; There they shone as red as blood, Three together on one stalk. âStay!â I cried, with trembling lip, All too late the slow commands; Clip! and then a clip and clip! And the flowers were in my hands. Just a moment, brave and bright, Just a moment, ripe and red; âGardener, take them from my sight!â They were drooping, dying, dead. Strong of heart and sound of head, Straight I called my girls and boys: âJoys that are unearned,â I said, âAre but mockeries of joys.â And their light and laughing glee, As about good tasks I set, Said as plain as plain could be, There be sweet buds waiting yet. CHASING ECHOES. Two travellers, when the east was red, Arose, paid reckoning for their bed, And, having broken fast with bread And meat, set out together. Of heart and hope they felt no lack; So each along the highway's track Carried his knapsack on his back As lightly as a feather. But when the sun his hot rays sent, Aside into the fields they went, And walked on grasses dew-besprent, And cool with many a shadow; Where robin, leaving his bush astir, Fluttered up with a sudden whir, And whistling to each, âGood morning, sir!â Went sailing over the meadow. At top of the dead tree, solemn and still, The black crow sat like a thing of ill; The red-winged woodpecker struck with bill Horny and hard, like a hammer; The modest bluebird twittered her song; The quails ran over the ground in a throng; The steel-blue swallow, with wing so strong, Took hold of the air like a swimmer. And evil seemed to flee with the night, As upward pushing his horn so bright, The sun went, leaving a trail of light In the mist, like a golden furrow; And viewing it all with a shake of the head, The younger man to the elder said, âBut for the sweat of the brow for bread, The world would hold no shadow!â So our travellers fell into easy talk, Half of it earnest, half of it mock, On methods the terrible fiat to balk; And arguing thus together, Left the field, unaware, behind; And entered a pathless wood so blind, Where mingled murmur of leaves and wind Gave token of stormy weather! Then to a whisper their loud speech fellâ Over the hillside, down in the dellâ Which was the right road neither could tell, And the rainy night was falling. And now the elder a sad breath drew; âWe are lost,â he said, âand the thing to do Is just to stand, and call âHalloo!â And see what comes of calling.â And the younger, answering back with dump Of gun and knapsack, all in a lump, Turning to one and another clump, Filled the woods with hallooing; When, lo! from the heart of silence rung A sound that seemed like a silver tongue, And which both men, with hope high strung, Believed to their bitter ruing. For soon the sky was all a-frown, The shadows changed from dun to brown, And pitiless the rain came down, And winds wailed, oh, so dreary! And never even the little spark Of a friendly candle threw on the dark Its welcome gleam, the path to mark For the feet so worn and weary. They turned their sad case round and round; 'T was death to sleep on the sodden groundâ And nothing better could there be found Than calling out, yet higher; And as they, breathless, harked once more, The voice came nearer than before, As if the woodman had come to the door, Or they to his hut were nigher. And so the twain got heart again, Saying, âIf it rains, why, let it rain! Some hermit hereabout, 't is plain, Is watching for our coming; How sweet 't will be to see him spread His board with fruit, and wine and bread, The while his fire, with mosses fed, In rosy warmth is humming!â Thus by the silver tongue misled, As best they could they trudged ahead, To find the supper and find the bed, And find the hermit holy; But what with trees so thickly set, And what with rain and cold and wet, And weariness and hunger-fret, They made their way but slowly. At last the winds began to spin Among the faded leaves and thin; And then, as daybreak light poured in, The cock-crow, and the rattle Of falling bars, and pasture-rails With tinklings blent of pans and pails, And low of drowsy cattle. The night was past, the rain was done, The sun was like an Easter sun, And all the tuneful birds begun To fill the air with praises. âAh,â said the friends (in pride's despite), âThat lying echo served us right; Men who will sin against the light Must reap the thorns, not daisies! âAnd we had travelled east and west, Had had our work-days and our rest, And gained good gains, but not the best, For this was left for learning: That, after all is done and said, But the straight way gets men ahead, And never honey-sweetened bread Like honesty of earning!â SONG FOR ALL SOULS. Ah, many a night I've lain awake, Of the nights when I was youngâ Long, long, and long agoâ To listen and listen o'er again To the lilting lay with the low refrain, Half sad, half sweet, âHeigh-ho!â Float silvery over the silver lake, With its clear refrain, âHeigh-ho!â Till far and near the echoes rung, Some sad, some sweet, âHeigh-ho!â âBlown away like daisy leaves; Whirled away like snow; All gone, dead and gone, Weary heart, heigh-ho!â Ah, many a night I 've lain awake In the garret rude and low, To listen to the lilting lay, Swelling and dying far away, Save only just the strange refrain, Half of pleasure and half of pain, Blown silvery over the silver lakeâ Blown soft as moonshine over the streams, And across my pillow and into my dreams: âSweet hearts and friends, heigh-ho! All gone, dead and gone; Whirled away from me, Like dry leaves in the winter winds, Or snowflakes in the sea.â Ah, many a night I 've lain awake, And listened with all my heart, To hear from over the silver lake The silvery echo start. Ay, start and tremble, strain o'er strain, To a wild and wailing call, Then softly sink to the sad refrain With a dulcet, dying fall: âAll gone, dead and gone; Whirled away from me, Like flowers of grass along the grass, Or sea-spray o'er the sea.â And I marvelled as I lay awake, And the marvel would not go, Who thus across the silver lake Should nightly sing and row; As if that he the lake had crossed Till youth and hope and love were lost, To come no more, no more; And he could not choose but sing so low The lilting lay with the sad refrain, And to sing it o'er and o'er again: âSweet hearts and friends, heigh-ho! All gone, lost and gone; Whirled away from me, Like dead leaves in the winter wind, Or sea-spray o'er the sea.â And I did not know, as I lay awake And listened to that song, Blown silvery over the silver lake, That I, and that ere long, That very rower's mood should take, And sing the same sad songâ That song so low, so lowâ And sing it o'er and o'er again, From the wild and wailing call, To the dulcet, dying fall: âSweet hearts and friends, heigh-ho! All gone, lost and gone; Whirled away from me, Like dead leaves in the winter wind, Or sea-spray o'er the sea.â HUGH THE VOLUNTEER. Boys, are you all at home to-night? Simon, and Seth, and John? How should the old house be so changed If only one is gone! You know I love you, each and allâ I need not say I do, But my heart is just as sad and sick As if I had only Hugh. I am with him in his tent at nightâ His morning drill I shareâ In the march, and in the field of fightâ I am with him everywhere. I miss his strong and willing hands In everything we doâ Another must do double work To fill the place of Hugh. Pray for him night and morn, boys, Pray for him all the dayâ Let me see, if he lives he will be Twenty years old in May. Ah, then we'll make the old house ring With many a merry soundâ God grant he may be back again Before the time comes round. Ay, back again, all sound and safe, To sing a birthday glee, And make his mother's heart grow youngâ But if he should n't be; We'll keep his place at the table, all The same as if he were hereâ He is n't the lad to spare himself, But there is n't much to fear. He is n't the lad to spare himself, Nor the lad to yield the rightâ But would to God this fight were done, And our Hugh at home to-night! TO MY FIRE. Let me trim and make you fair, With a hickory limb or two; Ah, I have not anywhere Such a cheerful friend as you! When I come home tired and sad, Always glowing, always glad. Memories my soul that rack Shrink from your rebuking flame; And their ghosts go wavering back To the darkness whence they came, When your embers sing and hum Of the happy days to come. When the future seems to lend Scarce a gleam, my life to grace, Like an old familiar friend You look up into my face; And my thoughts from vain regret Turn to what is left me yet. Many, many a lonesome night You have been my confidant, With your genial look and light Comforting my discontent. All my heart I trust to youâ Never had I friend so true. When the wind down chimney blows, How your bickering blazes spread, Till each blackened rafter glows With your shadows warm and red, And adown my lowly walls More than kingly splendor falls. THREE GOOD SHIPS. Three good ships came sailing in, Long ago, ay, long agoâ Three good ships came sailing in So early in the morning; And all the winds to the shore did blow, And all the sails were as white as snow, So early in the morning. Three good ships so brave and new, Long ago, ay, long ago, Three good ships so brave and new, Early in the morning; And the sea was smooth and the sky was blue, And every soul on board was true, Early in the morning. Sailing over the silver sea, Long ago, ay, long ago, Freighted with freight that was all for me, Early in the morning; And âHopeâ and Faith,â they were stout and tall, But âLoveâ was the best ship of them all, Early in the morning. Three good ships a-sailing in, Long ago, ay, long ago, Three good ships a-sailing in Early in the morning; But there were breakers to be crossed, And one of the three good ships was lost, Early in the morning. Two good ships a-sailing in, Slow and sad, and sad and slow, Two good ships a-sailing in Through the cloudy morning; For air and sky were all a-frown, And of the two ships one went down, In the mournful morning. Sailing over the solemn sea, Through the foam, the cold white foam, One good ship is left to me, Far away from the morning; Hope and Love, they both are gone, But Faith is sailing sadly on Toward the eternal morning. FLAWS. O sunshine, like a cloth of gold Drawn out along the air, The clouds, or yellow, black, or brown, A-sailing up, a-sailing down, But make you doubly fair! O grasses, like a queen's gay shawl Upon her crowning day, The border of rough, prickly burs, And nettles black, and wilding furze, Your tenderer tints display. O bird of ragged quill, and wing As speckled as a flower, Sing, sing your heart up to your throat; 'T is just the one wild, wailing note That gives your song its power. Sweetheart of mineâsweetheart of mine, Whom all my thoughts adore, Hide your blue eyes, and frown and pout; It is our little fallings out That make us love the more! Whatever things be fine or brightâ Gay grass, or golden air, Or red of rose, or lily's snowâ It is the flaw that makes them so; All fair would not be fair! Of better things, it seems to me, Life's best is but the sign; Else, in this wicked world, would be No room for blessÃ¨d charityâ No room for love divine. HOPE. When all my fields are frozen, When all my orchards nakÃ¨d stand, I hear a sound that is like the sound Of a sower, sowing the land. And all at once the limbs of leaves, So darkly-dim before, Shine round me like a thresher's sheaves When he stands in his threshing-floor. Awake from troubled slumber, In the middle watch o' the night, I see a hand that is like the hand Of a painter, painting the light. And all at once, with the shadows Are threads of silver spun, And all my room is like the bloom Of a garden in the sun. When pleasures please no longer, When the charm of love is lost, When my dearest hopes before me Like chaff in the winds are tost; My empty heart forgets its lack, And I hear a voice that sings Like the mother-bird when she calleth back Her little ones to her wings. When the sea of life is darkest, When the billows gap with graves, I hear a step that is like a step That is treading on the waves; And all at once the clouds are rent, And I with my spirit see That time is but an incident Of the great eternity. TO ANY DESPONDING GENIUS. Take this for granted once for all: There is neither chance nor fate, And to sit and wait for the sky to fall, Is to wait as the foolish wait. The laurel, longed for, you must earnâ It is not of the things men lend, And though the lesson be hard to learn, The sooner the better, my friend. That another's head can have your crown Is a judgment all untrue, And to drag this man, or the other down, Will not in the least raise you! For, in spite of your demur, or mine, The gods will still be the gods, And the spark of genius will outshine The touchwood, by all odds! Be careful, careful work to do, Though at cost of heart, or headâ The praises, even of the Review, Will hardly stand in stead. No light that through the ages shines To worthless work belongsâ Men dig in thoughts as they dig in mines, For the jewels of their songs. A fresco painter in ceiling wrought, With eyelids strained, 't is said, Till he could but read of the fame so bought, With the page above his head. Hold not the world as in debt to you, When it credits you day by day, For the light and air, for the rose and dew, And for all that cheers your way. And you, in turn, as an honest man, Are bound, you will understand, To give back either the best you can, Or to die, and be out of hand. COMING AND GOING. Hoarding and heapingâhoarding and heapingâ And now there are lights, and garlands gay, For a babe is born in the house to-day, And his two blue eyes are sleeping; And close by the cradle the father stands, And thinks of his acres of well-sown lands, And of when the two little dimpled hands Will be strong enough for reaping. Budding and bloomingâbudding and bloomingâ And the winds are playing like flutes on the hills, And the stones are beaten like drums in the rills, And the birds in clouds are coming; And song and fragrance float in the breeze, And all the blossoms of all the trees Are edged with fringes of golden bees Sucking and hummingâsucking and humming. Wailing and weepingâwailing and weepingâ And now the lights in the house are low, And now the roses have ceased to glow, And the women watch are keeping; And close by the coffin the father stands, And, bitterly moaning, wrings his hands, And barren of pleasure are all his lands, For the babe wakes not from sleeping. Blighting and blowingâblighting and blowingâ And the stones of the rivulet silent lie, And the winds in the fading woodlands cry, And the birds in clouds are going; And the dandelion hides his gold, And their blue little tents the violets fold, And the air is gray with snowing: So life keeps coming and going. THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PICTURE. They may talk of old age And its pleasures who please, Of the rosy-cheeked lad on The grandfather's knees; Of the granddaughter, too, With her soft golden hair Hanging over the back of His great easy-chair; But I don't quite relish My time of the day, Sitting here in my nightcap Rheumatic and gray! My grandson is surely A nice little elf, But then I would rather Be boy for myself! And I love my granddaughter, So sweet and so shy, But I'd rather have gold hair Than gray, would n't I? I can't make it seem any way But just queer, That I should have taken on Year after year, Until my broad shoulders Bent under the strain, And I had to prop up my Weak legs with a cane! And take to soft crusts, And meal gruel and milk, And go in a jacket Of wool, not of silk, And carefully garter My fleecy-lined hose, And keep a sharp eye to The end of my nose! When I think of the time We were married, my dear, It seems to me something That happened last year, And I fairly distrust both My sense and my sight, When I look up and see That your head is so white! And spite all assurance, I can't think it's true That I should be I, and That you should be you! 'T is hard to receive it And make it seem fair, That we should be toddling The way that we are; But rather as if an Exception should be Made out and extended To you and to me, As if we had come to The close of the day Without ever having had Open, fair play! I know I am wrong here, But when all is done, The shadow will not be so sweet As the sun. So, let the old people Talk fine as they please About lives lived over In holiday ease; I say, what is ease worth, Laid up high and dry, With a great gouty toe And a rheum in the eye? And think, if 't were all Just the same to the shelves, The old folks would rather Stand up for themselves! And run in the race with The sturdy-legged boys, And share with the gay girls Their frolicsome joys; And, bravely defiant Of all gouty pains, Tear off the red flannels And burn up the canes; And put on the shining And beautiful gear, And cease to look querulous, Crooked, and queer. But I, after all, am not So set at strife With the wonderful order And wisdom of life, As dare, if I might, to turn Up and turn back The locks, thin and gray, To the side, thick and black; Or boldly to take the Responsible part Of saying, if life were To live from the start, I 'd render up cleaner Account of my trust, Or deal with my neighbor More honest and just. So let us, my darling, Give praise to his name, Who has kept us from slipping In pitfalls of shame; And, wrapt from the chill Of the rough winter weather, Go down the life hill As we came up, together! And when we no longer Can brave the rough storms, Just sleep in the shelter Of each other's arms. THE TIME OF THE DEW-FALL. We sat upon the smooth sea sand, And watched the tide flow in and out, And knew what it was all aboutâ Heart held in heart and hand to handâ In the time of the morn and the dew-fall. With faces toward each other leant, We saw the green heads of the trees, And heard the whispering of the breeze, And knew what all the sweetness meant, In the time of the morn and the dew-fall. We saw the long gray east o'erblown With flowers that wore the look of light, And they were lovely in our sight, And all their secret meanings known, In the time of the morn and the dew-fall. Like the thick coming of a cloud We saw the birds, and knew each noteâ Of speckled-wing, and golden-throat, Or soft and low, or shrill and loud, All in the morn and the dew-fall. We dropped the seed-corn in the ground Without a single thought or fear About the full, ripe, rounded ear, When time should bring the harvest round, All in the morn and the dew-fall. Ah, not in vanity or pride, But out of love, whence wisdom springs, We took the tangled web of things And stretched it straight from side to side, All in the morn and the dew-fall. Our hearts, alas, no longer beat As one, and hand has fallen from hand, And I am slow to understand The things that were so plain and sweet In the time of the morn and the dew-fall. AN EVENING RHYME. This was a goodly dayâthe sun Sunk to his rest in radiant calms; I hear the gray sea singing psalms The same as he has always done. The moon in tender beauty clad Looks down upon me from the skyâ What is it ails the time, that I Should be so sick at heart, so sad! My baby's little lispings war Against it, all in vainâah me, His golden head upon my knee Seems farther from me than the star! I feel, alas I know not what Of darkness on my senses fallâ Friends comeâthe best friend of them all Comes to me, yet he finds me not; Or I find him not, for he seems Like other men, nor less nor moreâ Time was with me the dress he wore, The book he read, was food for dreams. That time will come again to meâ For if we would, we cannot break The sweet affinities that make Such poems in our livesânot we. And this dull mood that seems th' abuse Of opportunity, is right; Light cannot be defined by lightâ The blur, the shadow, have their use; The failure teaches us to know The way of successâstrife bringeth strengthâ Pain works itself to peace at length, The unstable brings the sure, and though The world within our hearts to-day, Like a great emerald in a rim Of rubies, straightway groweth dim, And slippeth from our hearts away; I hold this truth all truths aboveâ Whatever else that firmest stands Shall slide together like dry sandsâ The truth, the eternity of love! OLD FRIENDS. You with fortune's gale that float, Welcome to my rough-hewn boat! Pleasant is your sunny crew, But, O friends, of rainy weather, Tenderer love I bear to you, We have borne the heat together! Pleasure's tie a chance may sever, But the ties of sorrow, never! And, old friends, though bitter storms Part us, in my dreams I gather Each of you in memory's arms, And we sail away together, Toward that fair and friendly shore Whither hope has gone before. For life's promise now is lostâ Time has cut youth's golden tether, And we feel the autumn frost Falling on our heads together. But though gloom our voyage enshrouds, Day breaks brightest in the clouds; And though earth be sad and cold, Heaven is made of flowery weather, And as here we 're growing old, There, we shall grow young together. THE SUICIDE. Where the dry, dusty road makes a crook to evade The clump of sweet maples that offer their shade, 'T is there that the grave of poor Margaret is made. Where the river you see pushes into the shore, As if in its bosom some treasure it bore Belonging to earth, which it fain would restore; Ah, there 't was they found her, her arms o'er her head, As if she had drawn up the waves to o'erspread Her corpse from all pity, when she should be dead. Where the grass to the water slopes green, it was there They shut up her eyes from their wondering stare, That they wrung out the wet from her garments and hair. I shall say, if the judgment shall call me to speak, âA kiss might have put out the fire in her cheek That urged her the last awful refuge to seek.â âMY BOY.â Ah, winter days, be not so cold, so cold! And if my little houseless boy you see, Quilt all your iron shadows thick with gold, And lap them round himâhe is all to me. Oh, winter winds, if ever, as you blow, You find, in some wild place apart from joy, A shining head, with curls along the snow, Soften your rough voiceâthat will be my boy! Oh, happy mothers! while you watch at night The bright blaze making all the wide room gay, Keep on some upper floor a little lightâ My poor, lost child may chance to pass that way! And if, when all without is blind with gloom,â Among your boys and girls, alive with joy, A little white face peer,âmake room, make room, Between their red cheeksâthat will be my boy! False witnesses to prison may have lied My pretty lambâoh, warden! if you see One strange to wrong, and ready to divide His sliceânay, give it all, why that is he! Loose from his tender limbs the cruel bandsâ Even though he sinned, shall that my love destroy? Here to your chains I give my old, rough hands, To prison, to death will I, to save my boy! GROWTH. The living stream must flow, and flow, And never rest, and never wait, But from its bosom, soon or late Cast the dead corpse. Time even so Runs on and on, and may not rest, But from its bosom casts away The cold dead forms of yesterdayâ Once best, may not be always best. That which was but the dream of youth, Begot of wildest fantasy, To our old age, perhaps, may be A good and great and gracious truth. That which was true in time gone by, As seen by narrow, ignorant sight, May in the longer, clearer light Of wiser times, become a lie. I hold this trueâwho ever wins Man's highest stature here below, Must grow, and never cease to growâ For when growth ceases, death begins. LITTLE THINGS. Shall we strike a bargain, Fate? And wilt thou to this agree? Take whatever things are great, Leave the little things to me! Take the eagle, proud and dark, Broad of shoulders, strong of wing; Leave the robin, leave the lark, 'T is the little birds that sing! Take the oak-wood, towering up, With its top against the skies; Leave one little acorn cup, Therein all the forest lies! Take the murmurous fountain-heads, Take the river, winding slow; But about my garden-beds Leave the dewdrop, small and low. Winding waves are fine to view, Sweet the fountain's silver call; But the little drop of dew Holds the sunshine, after all. Take the sea, the great wide sea, White with many a swelling sail; Leave the little stream to me, Sliding silent through the vale. Poesy will find her theme In thy grander portion, still, 'T is my little, unpraised stream Of the meadow, turns the mill. Take the palace, all ashine, With its lofty halls and towers; Let the little house be mine, With its door-yard grass and flowers. Take the lands, the royal lands, All with parks and orchards bright; Leave to me the little hands, Clinging closely morn and night. Ah, for once be kindly, Fate, To my harmless plan agree; Take whatever things are great, Leave the little things to me! BURNS. Time, paint him as he was among His darling daisies at the plow, With bonnet old and poor, but hung Right bravely on his honest brow. Or better, with his plaidie wide And unashamed of homespun gear, Turning his weeding clips aside To save old Scotia's emblem dear. For idle, all, the strife to vamp With gauds, great nature's simple plan; The rank is but the guinea's stamp, The gold for a' that is the man. Ah, paint him as he was, nor seek His life with alien grace to trim; No look of scourging in his cheek, No saintly chastity for him! Paint him a loverâin his song Catching all hearts, his own still lightâ Not haggard, as he looked ere long, Affronted at neglect and slight. Bravely against the fate foregone, Striving some little good to winâ Not in that wave which on and on Allured him, till it drew him in. Paint the great soul that yet with cries Must rend the clay, not wear it through, Making within his wondrous eyes Signs of the work it had to do. Alas, that wayward, wavering strife Towards worthier living, but reveal The war, the mystery of the life That other men but half conceal. Paint all the bonny braes and streams That called his inspirations out; Not the poor skeleton of dreams He lived his after-life about. Ah, Time, be gentle with his fame, Nor let his frailties, judgment sway, For when he seemed the most to blame 'T was nature having all her way. 'T was love that was his law of right, And spite of all he thus defied, No life has a diviner light Than his, upon the heavenly side. NANNIE. I can remember when our roof Would not keep out the rain; We have been very poor, Nannie, I wish we were again! For when the frosty autumn came, And all the oaks had bled Their piteous hearts into the leaves Until the woods were red, I never felt the chill, Nannie, And never feared the storm; Your love was better than a cloak To keep me safe and warm. And sometimes in the winter days I 've almost felt the glow Of fire-light, as I stooped to write Your name upon the snow. Now all is changed. The hills are gone Where gently every night The cows were used to stoop their necks Beneath your hands so white. The red rose through the broken pane Leans tenderly no more To see the sunshine's golden rule Along the ashen floor. And you never sit upon my knee, And never make me sure You love me just as well as in The days when we were poor. THE OLD MAN'S WOOING. Come sit upon my knee, Minie, And, darling, do not frown, You know my hair is thin and white, And yours is thick and brown: So sit upon my knee, Minie, And lean your bright head low Against my cheek, for see, Minie, My hair is white as snow. And sing me that old song, Minie, About the summer dead, Its pleasant tune has all the time Been going through my head, Since when you sang it first, Minie, In tones so sweet and clear, With but a little sky between Ourselves and heaven, my dear. My eyes are going blind, Minie, My heart is sad with care, And you are like a bright young rose, That I must never wear. If you were not so young, Minie, And I were not so gray, I'd ask if you would smile sometimes, And make my darkness day. Oh, when I'm dead and gone, Minie, You must not come to weep, The lightest sigh you breathed for me Would wake me out of sleep: Would wake me out of death, Minie; Ah, do not tremble so, You know I cannot love, Minie, My hair is white as snow. CHEER AND WARNING. Here's a rhyme and a cheerful God-speed For the weak and the pushed to the wall; And here 's for the strong a take heed, Lest haply they stumble and fall. For none are too low and too poor For hope to go down to, and none In th' world's highest places are sure Of keeping the heights they have won. The best man should never pass by The worst; but, to brotherhood true, Entreat him thus gently, âLo, I Am tempted in all things, as you.â Of one dust all peoples are made, One sky doth above them extend, And whether through sunshine or shade Their paths run, they meet at the end. And whatever his honors may be Of riches, or genius, or blood, God never made any man free To find out a separate good. So, giving to virtue its worth, The frail be I slow to decry, For while there 's a soul on the earth That suffers and sins, so do I. ALL IN ALL. More than we have been, my brother, We must be to one another, In our dark estate. We are poor, and very lonelyâ Love, and one another only, We must work and wait. All the green and dewy splendor, All the blossoms sweet and tender, From the fields are gone. In the woodland, in the mowing. At the seedtime, at the ploughingâ We must work alone. They are gone that made the brightnessâ Gone, who gave our hearts their lightness; And while life shall last, We no more may turn our faces Forward to the world's high placesâ Our delights are past. We must plant bright flowers about themâ We must learn to live without them In our dark estate, And must henceforth be, my brother, All in all to one another, While we work and wait. CHANGE. We had but a humble home, With few and simple joys; But my father's step was proud and firm, And my brothers were laughing boys. We have much that we longed for then, Our hearth is broad and bright; But my brothers now are saddened men, And my father's hair is white. WHAT A WRETCHED WOMAN SAID TO ME. All the broad East was laced with tender rings Of widening light; the Daybreak shone afar; Deep in the hollow, 'twixt her fiery wings, Fluttered the morning star. A cloud, that through the time of darkness went With wanton winds, now, heavy-hearted, came And fell upon the sunshine, penitent, And burning up with shame. The grass was wet with dew; the sheep-fields lay Lapping together far as eye could see; And the great harvest hung the golden way Of Nature's charity. My house was full of comfort; I was propped With life's delights, all sweet as they could be, When at my door a wretched woman stopped, And, weeping, said to me,â âIts rose-root in youth's seasonable hours Love in thy bosom set, so blest wert thou; Hence all the pretty little red-mouthed flowers That climb and kiss thee now! âI loved, but I must stifle Nature's cries With old dry blood, else perish, I was told; Hence the young light shrunk up within my eyes; And left them blank and bold. âI take my deeds, all, bad as they have been,â The way was dark, the awful pitfall bare;â In my weak hands, up through the fires of sin, I hold them for my prayer.â âThe thick, tough husk of evil grows about Each soul that lives,â I mused, âbut doth it kill? When the tree rots, the imprisoned wedge falls out, Rusted, but iron still. âShall He who to the daisy has access, Reaching it down its little lamp of dew To light it up through earth, do any less, Last and best work, for you?â</field>
      <field name="fulltext">POEMS OF NATURE AND HOME. THE GRANDMOTHER. She says she has left the world behind, But the world is not forgot, And says she keeps as strong in her mind As she ever was, God wot. Only the things about her change Too fast for her to see, And all is wide, and vast, and strangeâ Ah! foolishly awry, and strange, And not as it used to be! She says the boys are kept from school To mind her, without call; 'T is pity if she cannot rule Herself, who has ruled them all! She will not have them stand and wait, She can climb the stile alone, Only the path is not so straight, So smooth and pleasureful and straight, As it was in the years agone! She says her old eyes keep their sight, And, up the farm and down, She knows when the buckwheat-field is white, And the barley-field is brown. She takes her little trembling share, When the harvest song is sung, Only the ears are not so fairâ Ah! not so large and fine and fair As they were when she was young. She says when the tune for the dance is set Her feet grow almost light, And her heart would still be dancing yet When the winds play up at night; Only for this, she says: they pass No more like a dancer's tread, But as if they blew across the grassâ The long, wild, waving, tear-wet grassâ That grows above her dead. NOONDAY AT HARVEST. The middle of day, and the middle of Juneâ No breath of air is blowing, And the still and sultry heats of noon Glint hot along the mowing. Now echoes from the distant horn Come shrilling through the meadows, Among the reapers reaping corn, And the shadows reaping shadows. Now boldly out of the hills they startâ Now farther fade, and thinner, And the farmer slowly mounts his cart, And slowly drives to dinner. Now out of the stubble's crispy beds, And down to the marshy hollow, While tossing their jackets over their heads, The sunburnt reapers follow, In hats of straw, and blue shirt-sleeves, And with herculean shouldersâ A picture they that needs must please The eyes of all beholders. With head dropt low, the sober gray Betwixt the ruts steers surely, And a little girl on a wisp of hay By her father sits demurely; Trimming her locks of tawny gold With leaves of rose and cedar, While her little brother, ten years old, Sits sideways on the leader. Loose dangle down his dusty feet, His tongue like a crow is cawing, And he keeps his balance in his seat By even-timed see-sawing. Two cows that pasture in the road, With never an eye to mind them, Are stealing mouthfuls out the load That is coming up behind them. Here, over the steep bank where they pass, An old gray stone is cropping, All round about it the tender grass In luminous fringes dropping. And there a water cuts the land Betwixt the fields and fallows, And silvery over the silver sand Lies all in warm, soft shallows. The merry horn no longer sounds, The winds a hush are keeping, And the echoes whisper back like hounds, And fall in the hills a-sleeping. And never a cricket makes his call, Nor wild bird shows a feather, As men and children, shadows and all, Move slowly home together. MOTHER AND CHILD. Within her rustic woodland bower, Like some warm-hearted, tender flower, With young buds all around her, She kept, in her gracious and glad content, And never a dream nor fancy went From the tendrilled twigs that bound her. The house was full of the pleasant noise Of gay, glad girls and sturdy boys, Each with a heart like a blossom; They were sevenâfive ranged between The head that was touching sweet sixteen And the babe on the mother's bosom. In hopeful toil the day went by, And when the tired sun built in the sky His great, red, cloudy bower, She gathered her buds about her kneeâ The sturdy three and the gentle threeâ This motherly woodland flower. And when the glory died in the west, And the birds were all in the sleepy nest, She would sit in the twilight shadow, And think how her baby should grow so fine, And make her place in the world to shine As the lily maketh the meadow. Years came and went, and the pleasant noise Was hushed in the house, and the girls and boys Came now no more about her; As the bird went home to the drowsy nest, And the sun to his cloudy bower in the west, They had learned to do without her! The little children that used to beâ The comely three and the sturdy threeâ Young men and beautiful maidens, And each had chosen out of the heart, And gone to be in a bower apart, And to dress them separate Edens. And the mother's thoughts went wearily Across the prairie, and over the sea, And through the wintry weather, About the streets, o'er the desert sand, To take them once again by the hand, And to gather them all together. But alway, as the sun went down, And the gold and scarlet fell to brown, And the brown to deeper shadow, Her babe made all the house as bright As the lily, with her leaves of light, Maketh her place in the meadow. She could not grow from the loving arms, Nor go to meet the wide world's storms Away from the lowly portals: For Death, in the broidered slip and cap, Had left her to lie in the mother's lap, In her babyhood immortal. LONGINGS. I long, how I long for some dim little nook, With the leaves of the wild open rose for my book, And to read there the sweet things, and things that are true, Which the Lord's hand has written in sunshine and dew. And I long, my old mother, to lie on thy breast, With never a thought to o'erlap the deep rest, My warm to thy cold heart, my face to thy faceâ A loyal and royal and restful embrace. I long so to whisper myself to the trees, And to sing out my nature, as sings the free breeze, And to make the waste places o'erflow with my strains, As the meadows' green cisterns o'erflow with the rains. I long with great longing acquainted to be With the hill-top, the mountain, the terrible sea; To cry the wild cry of the raven, above, And to 'plain with the turtle the dole of my love. I long from my feet to unfasten the shoes, And my hair from its combs, and its fillets to loose, And deep in the arms of the water to tread, Till the leaves of the lilies are over my head. Ay, under the lilies to languish and swimâ All the world like a dream that is distant and dimâ No conscience to goad me, no cloud to o'ercast, No hope for the future, no sigh for the past. O just for a day, for one day to be free From all that I have been, from all I can be; To feel, like a curtain, forgetfulness fall, And shield me away from myself most of all. I long for this day stricken out and apart From my friend, and my neighbor, my home and my heart, And to find, with the swallow, some dear little nest, When the crimson is fading all out of the west. A dear little nest, such as only can stand In visions, and not on the sea or the land, Where never that guest, that no other can see, Should sit at the hearth-side, a terror to me. LO! THE SPRING RAIN! Drip-a-drop! drip! drop! O soft and soaking rain! And paint all over the fairy's cup The red on the golden grain, And draw the green through the long white leaves Of the frozen grass again. Drip-a-drop out of the skies, And winds blow east and west, The lily lids are over her eyes, And ye cannot break her rest; All safe from wind and rain she lies, With her hands across her breast! Drip-a-drop, fast or slow, For your showers, or more or less, Will never stain through her grassy roof To the folds of her bridal dressâ Will never dampen the curl from the curls That her pallid cheek caress. Drip-a-drop, call to the Eve To shut up the daisy's eye, And to teach the rose her leaves to close Where the sweets compacted lie, That she at the break of the day may wake, And all outblush the sky. Drip-a-drop all to the Mornâ Arise, disshadow the hills, And send the larks from your nesting lap, To wake the sun with their trills, And shake the damps of dew from the lamps Of the glorious daffodils. Drop! drip, drop! drip, drop! Till you empty each sable cloud; For there never was sleep so still and deep As the sleep of the folding shroud, That only breaks when Gabriel wakes The dead with his trump so loud. PLANTING SONG. Up, my brown eyes! up, my brown eyes! Get your white necks under the yokeâ Up, up, for the day has broke. Red and yellow, yellow and red, Like roses blown in a daffodil bedâ Up, my brown eyes, under the yoke! On, my brown eyes! on, my brown eyes! Bend your white necks low to your workâ Early, early, early and late, Stretch out the traces stiff and straight, And plough up the furrows moist and darkâ Down with your white necks, down to your work! Go, my brown eyes! go, my brown eyes! White necks all of the yoke unwornâ Out, out, out of the tracesâ Up, up, up with your faces! And come, little maidens, and plant the corn! Yellow, yellow, e'en as the morn! Rest, my brown eyes! rest, my brown eyesâ Free of the traces, night and morn! Light as the dew-fall, light as the rain, Patter back, little maids, again; Back to the meadows you sowed with corn; Feet so waxen, strong-limbed oxen, Rest in the shade of the broad-leaved corn! MILKMAID'S MARRIAGE SONG. Come up, my speckle-face! Come, my fair speckle-face! Come, for the morning is bright as can be; Leave the grass, dewy wetâ Leave the dear violetâ Come, my good speckle, you 're going with me! Out of the woody land, Up through the meadow land, Down by the flax-field, and past the gay corn; Come, ere the rising sun Over yon cloud so dun On the high eastern hill pushes his horn; Past the green barley ridge, Over the shallow bridge, On through the clover as red as a rose; We must be far away, Ere the blue eye of day, Opening in sunshine, in shadow shall close. Come, little speckle-face, Come from your hiding-place; You must be combed till your coat is like silkâ Oh, but you'd proudly come If you could know for whom You shall hereafter give pails full of milk! Softly as marriage bells, Through the low dipping dells Brings the sweet water that runs to the sea; Lift, lift your eyes so brownâ How can you keep them down, When, little speckle, you 're going with me? Never the buttercups Shone with such pearly drops, Never the meadow-lark sung out so gay; Come from your hiding-place, Speckle-face, speckle-face, I'm to be marriedâbe married to-day! MAYING. In the sweet time of May, When fields and woods are gay, And large and little flowers are all a-blooming, I think that thou must find This true, if thou but mind: Pleasure is either past, or else a-coming. When merry birds do crowd The branches, singing loudâ The black, the bluebirdâhe of scarlet featherâ And tender, brown-eyed doves, Make dole to tell their loves, And winds and waters talk and laugh together; When bees about their hives Are working for their lives, When with his shadow every leaf is dancing, While from the land, the sea For very joy doth be Retiring now, and now again advancing; When not a cloud be spied The blue of heaven to hide, And not a lamb of all the flock be straying, I think if thou art fair, Thou still must needs declare 'T is not our birthright here to go a-Maying. THE SNOW-FLOWER. The fields were all one field of snow, The hedge was like a silver wall; And when the March began to blow, And clouds to fill, and rain to fall, I wept that they should spoil it all. At first the flakes with flurrying whirl Hid from my eyes the rivulet, Lying crooked, like a seam of pearl, Along some royal coverletâ I stood, as I remember yet, With cheeks close-pressed against the pane, And saw the hedge's hidden brown Come out beneath the fretting rain; And then I saw the wall go downâ My silver wall, and all was brown. And then, where all had been so white, As still the rain slid slant and slow, Bushes and briers came out in sight, And spikes of reeds began to show, And then the knot-grass, black and low. One day, when March was at the close, The mild air balm, the sky serene, The fields that had been fields of snows, And, after, withered wastes, were seen With here and there some tender green; That day my heart came sudden up With pleasure that was almost painâ Being in the fields, I found a cup, Pure white, with just a blood-red vein Dashed round the edges, by the rain. The rain, which I that wild March hour So foolishly had wept to see, Had shaped the snow into a flower, And thus had brought it back to me Sweeter than only snow, could be. THE TWO MOWERS. I know not what brings back to-day A scene of the long ago, When, all betwixt the blue and the gray, Two mowers came to mow. About the scythes that cut their path The dewdrops fell in showers, And every long and luminous swath They swung, was mixed with flowers. Here ivies sweet and tufted crows Lie low beneath their tread; And there the slender neck of a rose Without her royal head. Swish! swish! and neither heeds nor spares The pansy freaked with jet, Nor she that sad embroidery wears, Nor the milky violet. Swish! then a pause, and then another swath, And a zigzag line is seen; And in betwixt them, on the path, A turf of sheltering green. We children could not keep away, But ran with skip and bound, To find on her nest of sticks and clay A bird so safe and sound. Her back as smooth and brown as a mouse, And her wing of a ruddy glow, Like the roof and hearthstone of the house Whence the mowers came to mow. How fixed the day in memory stands! And the time of the day, for then, We that had called them only hands Began to call them men! We made our hands with raking roughâ And the winds they kissed us brown; And the shaggy beards grew fair enough Before the sun was down. For we knew that deep in the hearts of both True love had been the guest, That made them cut the zigzag swath, And spare the lowly nest. PLEA TO OCTOBER. Little 'tis I ask of thee, Season fine and fair, Lying betwixt the roses lost And the falling of the frostâ Little for my share. Fortune has been hard with me; Thou hast wealth to spare. Thus my plea, the whole day long: Shall I call it just a song, Or shall I call it prayer? What thou wilt, thou may'st withhold, Till we shall agree. Lo! thou mak'st the winds that blow 'Twixt the sunflower and the snow To be sweet with me. Keep the daffodilly's gold, Keep the corn and wine; But some green and grassy nook, Where to lie and read my book, Leave, I pray, for mine. Oh, be kind, be kind to me; Nor let rough winds blow, Putting out, with rainy nights, All the twinkling meadow-lights, Burning down so low. Hearts have failed me all the way Toward the night's dread fall; Grant that hour, for mercy's sake, Love enough to keep awake, Sweetest eyes of all. I contented am to be Neither fine nor fair; Lo! thou rightest me this wrongâ Slight it not for just a song, But grant it for a prayer. Friendship may but last a day; Passion is a spell Transient as the whirlwind's breath; Grant me love as strong as deathâ Ay, indestructible! A PASSING WISH. Oh, for the life of a gipsy! A strong-arm, barefoot girl; And to have the wind for a waiting-maid To keep my hair in curl; To bring me scent of the violet, And the red rose, and the pine; And at night to spread my grassy bedâ Ah! would n't it be divine? Oh, for the life of a gipsy! So gloriously free! Through the world to roam, and to find a home 'Neath every greenwood tree; To milk my cow in the meadow, Wherever she chanced to stand; And to have my cornfields planted By every lad in the land! Oh, for the life of a gipsy! With the dew to fringe my gown; And to have the sun for a sweetheart To come and kiss me brown; To take each little chubby-cheek That I chose, and call her mine, And teach her to tramp from camp to campâ Ah! would n't it be divine? Oh, for the life of a gipsy! To lie in the lazy shades; And to predict sweet fairings To all the village maids; To give them caps of pretty flowers, And shawls of wool so white, And troops of lovers to sing them songs At their window-panes at night! Oh, for the life of a gipsy! To hunt the hare for play; And to take my trap on my shoulder And hie away and awayâ Away to the tents by the water, When the stars begin to shineâ To my glad wild crew, with hearts so trueâ Ah! would n't it be divine? Oh, for the life of a gipsy! To be up at the dawning gray; And to have my dog, like my shadow, Beside me all the day; To have a hat of plaited straw, And a cloak of scarlet dye, And shoot like a light through the glens at night, And make the owlets cry! Oh, for the life of a gipsy! To roam the wild woods through; To have the wind for a waiting-maid, And the sun for a sweetheart true; To say to my restless conscience, Be still; you are no more mine! And to hold my heart beneath my artâ Ah! would n't it be divine? A YEAR AGO. The sun across the hill Is gazing bright and bold, But the valley with the frost in her lap, Chaste and chilly cold; All in her sheets of mist, From morn to evening lies, Unconscious of the bold, bright face Of her lover in the skies! Spirits of coming flowers The sense wellnigh deceives; The rose awaiting to be dressed In her dainty body of leaves; The hollyhock and pink, For their cups of brown and red, And the lily for a holy veil To lap about her head. The fisher sings by the sea, As he mends his broken net, And all with golden drops of light Are the rainy shadows set. In a cloud of whitest dreams, But a little year ago, Like a tender Alpine flower Nestling under the snow, The lady of my heart Was with me all day long, And the tears came out of her happy eyes To praise the fisher's song. Her song is sweeter now Than the fisher's by the sea, And the rose in her dainty body of leaves Is not so fair as she! THE GRAVE OF THE SETTLER'S BOY. The hill is bleak and bare enough, Thistles are all the flowers it owns; Round it the road runs zigzag, rough With miry ruts and loose, gray stones. Ay, bleak and bare and cheerless, save One quiet spot that scarce is seen, And there, about a little grave, The turf is smooth, and low and green. For, seeing that lone grave, sometimes The teamster checks his whistling gay, And blocks his heavy wheel, and climbs The fence, and pulls the weeds away. There kindly nature paints the shade With insects, as with tenderest dies; There fox and hare, all unafraid, Look straight into the hunter's eyes. For while he thinks of suns gone down, Of hopes long lost, of long-lost care, His trusty rifle, bright and brown, Slips from his shoulder, unaware. All things are solemn; 'gainst the sky, The wood, a mass of shadow flows, And high above the shoals of rye, Her long, red arms the wild-brier throws. The birds scarce sing there even at morn, But as the long, slow hours go past, With golden bills and bills of horn, Peck the black stubs, until at last, Leaving the world to deeper gloom, The sunshine from the landscape goes, And o'er the yet rejoicing bloom The moon her hoarded pallor snows. PRESENCE. The wild, sweet water, as it flows,â The winds, that kiss me as they pass,â The starry shadow of the rose, Sitting beside her on the grass,â The daffodilly, trying to bless With better light the beauteous air,â The lily, wearing the white dress Of sanctuary, to be more fair,â The lithe-armed, dainty-fingered brier, That in the woods, so dim and drear, Lights up betimes her tender fire To soothe the homesick pioneer,â The moth, his brown sails balancing Along the stubble crisp and dry,â The ground-flower, with a blood-red ring On either hand,âthe pewit's cry,â The friendly robin's gracious note,â The hills, with crimson weeds o'errun,â The althea, with her crimson coat Tricked out to please the wearied sun,â The dandelion, whose golden share Is set before the rustic's plow,â The hum of insects in the air,â The blooming bush,âthe withered bough,â The coming on of eve,âthe springs Of daybreak, soft and silver-bright,â The frost that, with rough, rugged wings, Blows down the cankered buds,âthe white Long drifts of winter snow,âthe heat Of August, falling still and wide,â Broad cornfields,âone chance stalk of wheat, Standing with bright head hung aside,â All things, my darling, all things seem In some strange way to speak of thee; Nothing is half so much a dream, Nothing so much reality. My soul to thine is dutiful, In all its pleasure, all its care; O most beloved! most beautiful! I miss, and find thee everywhere!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">POEMS OF GRIEF AND CONSOLATION. DYING. My Love, I love but only thee, Yet of a truth I must avow That I have taken an enemy Closer in my embrace, than thou. And if thou comest home some day, And find'st the household door shut up, Be not disconsolate, I pray, Because of that one bitter cup; But think of all the pleasant years Our paths did gently downward slope, And of the land where fall no tears, And live in memory and hope. In memory of the sacred hours When still from heaven some gracious gleam Ran like the tender hues through flowers, Making of all our lives a dream. In hope of that celestial birth From death to life, apart from woe; Of love, that to the love of earth Is as the sunshine to the snow. Spring, ay, the summer too, is gone, And autumn shadows darken all; Why should I care to linger on Till the wild storms of winter fall! KILLVALY. O the sweet waters, the silvery watersâ O the gay grass where together we strayed! Killvaly, Killvaly! wild, woody Killvaly, O for a day, with my love, in thy shade! O for a touch of the dear little fingers! O for a kiss of the mouth of my maid! Killvaly, Killvaly! glorious Killvaly, O for the silent consent of thy shade! O the glad whir of the wings that flew o'er us, Downy with linings of ruby and fawn; Killvaly, Killvaly! musical Killvaly, O for a day of the days that are gone! O the kind zephyr, my sweet, sweet accomplice, That drowned me almost in the waves of her hair; Killvaly, Killvaly! generous Killvaly, How couldst thou yield me a treasure so rare! O the ripe flush of the royal red roses I gathered, and gave to my fine little maid; Killvaly, Killvaly! cold, cruel Killvaly, How couldst thou hide that bright head in thy shade! What to me now are the dulcetest pleasures? What is the world since my pretty one died? Killvaly, Killvaly! calm, quiet Killvaly, Take me, and lull me to sleep by her side. SORROW. All the long weary day When I my tune would play, He maketh sad stops in my sweetest reed; And when the daylight ceases He breaketh up my sleep to little pieces, And thereupon doth feed. Alway at my spare feast, Ere yet the meat I taste, He cometh, and beside my board doth sit, And giveth me such looks As though that he were drawing with sharp hooks The marrow out of it. I may no longer use Such colors as I chooseâ Scarlet or lively green to be my gowns, For still he letteth fall His salt and bitter tears on one and all, Fading my reds to browns. Long whiles I stay apart From my most sweet sweetheart, Because of eyelids drooping in disgrace, For whatsoe'er I say, He maketh me to stammer such a way, As shames me to his face. The littlest room of all My house, is not so small, But there he maketh space and doth abide; O friends, for pity's sake, Out of your love a secret chamber make, And therein let me hide. For all the weary day When I my tune would play, He maketh sad stops in my sweetest reed; And when the daylight ceases He breaketh up my sleep to little pieces, And thereupon doth feed. TRACKS. My lost love, your spirit such quietude brings, I know that you live, and are well, as I know By the tracks of the birds that I see in the snow, That songs must be somewhere, that somewhere are wings. Lost, yet you were never all lost for a day; I know you are gone to your higher estate, And sitting low down in the shadows, I wait Till I too am ripe to be gathered away. Never lost, never lost! yet, my dear little friend, I miss the glad light of your wonderful eyes; And something I miss from the earth and the skies, That will not, and cannot come back, to the end. Our paths through the fields seem to be as strange ways; I wish that some night I could dream a sweet dream, Wherein the old nights and the old days would seem Like the old happy nights and the happy old days. I wish you could leave the good angels above! I wish I could have you, just one fleeting hour, To hold in my bosom, my sweet little flower, And tell you the height and the depth of my love. Sometimes such a doubt from the last darkness springs; My heart turneth sick, and my faith falleth low, But when the faint bird-tracks appear in the snow, I trust and believe in the songs and the wings. A MOTHER'S SOLACE. My little darling seems to me Lying here dead upon my knee: I know it is not soâthat I Am dead as much as she can die. Her hair in many a curl that lies, Would grow no nearer to her eyes That any sight of mine could know, Though I kept her always lying so. Her hands would seem like a snowy cross, One on the other, and I her loss Would mourn with tears, though while they fell I knew she was alive and well. So lay this clay that seems to be My little darling, from my knee: The life she lives is too divine To be interpreted to mine. My senses shut me in their cellâ She is outside, alive and well,â I am sinful, she is sinless, I Am dyingâshe has ceased to die. The love that made her thus to be Is more than mine is, therefore she Needs me not, or I need not herâ Love, so loving her, could not err. SPRING. Patches of snow may still be seen, And the boughs are black and bare, But the grass will soon be growing green, For the spring is in the air. The wintry silence seems to take Almost the shape of sound, As if the flowery folk were awake In their beds beneath the ground. The clouds that overhung the hills All winter, cold and white, Have taken the hue of the daffodils, For the spring is in the light. O mourners, as the fields grow fair, Let all your fears depart, For He who wakes the spring-time there Can waken it in the heart. The hopes you mourn as dead, but sleep, And will come to life like the flowers; The Lord hath taken, and he can keep, For his love is more than ours. When winter cometh, fear no ill, For his care is never done, And the heart of man it draweth him still As the dewdrop draws the sun. OVER THE SHIPS THE WHITE MISTS LIE. Over the ships the white mists lie, And the sea is cold and gray; The moon has taken her place in the sky, But her face is turned away. The half of her lovely light is gone, And the sea is cold and gray, But the ships are sailing on and on To their haven in the bay. They cut the mist, they stem the gale, And, till their ports be won, Sail to the land of morn, and sail To the land of the setting sun. My lover is sailing away from me, Sailing night and day, And wherever I look I seem to see The sea-mist, cold and gray. But I know the while my heart is tossed, And the mists of sorrow fall, âThat better 't is to have loved and lost Than not to have loved at all.â TO A PICTURE. Is this all? all? my rose-red lips, Where, where are your gentle sighs? You have only one of your thousand lights, My beautiful, beautiful eyes! The same sweet brow and dazzling hairâ On the cheek the same warm glowâ Ah, come and be folded in mine again, My dear little hands of snow! O cruel death, wilt thou not yield To the might of love like ours? I have seen the bleak cold earth in the rain Blaze wild and red with flowers! Still, still. If ever I did you wrong That your tender love concealed, Break this silence, life of my life, And say that my wound is healed! See, see! I am on my knees! No flush In the cheek? in the pulse, no start? O come from the canvas and make me liveâ Come, come to me, heart of my heart! One sign, my little white hands! one word, My rose-red mouth! though it killâ Change, change, my darling, your smile to a frownâ Be anything, but so still.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">POEMS OF LOVE. ROWAN RAMSEY. Rowan Ramsey, she is plainâ Plain as you would plainness call; Just her girlish golden hair Round her brow and bosom fair, For adornment, that is all! Rowan Ramsey, she is vain Of her girlish golden hair, And her feet, if she but stir, Dance about in spite of her, Just to show how small they are! Rowan Ramsey, she is neatâ Stocking, petticoat of snow, And her hair, like veil of lace, Slippeth fitly to the place Of her sleeve, so loose and low. Rowan Ramsey, she is sweet; Nature's child, as you will see; Never any bramble-bud, Born a mile deep in the wood, Grew to blossom pure as she. Rowan Ramsey's smiles do flow O'er her chaste, religious frown; And no little saintly nun, At her 'broidery in the sun, Droppeth eyelid lowlier down. Rowan Ramsey, she is low, High in goodness is her part; When we stand up to be wed, You shall see her golden head Shining level with my heart. Rowan Ramsey, she is smallâ Never smaller maid appeared Outside of a fairy bower; I could hide her like a flower, Underneath my grisly beard. Rowan Ramsey, she is all Just as I would have her be; Golden hair, and gown so simple, Brow and bosom, smile and dimple, Sweet as ever sweet can be! THE OLD MAN WHO WOULD A-WOOING GO. Mistress lady-lark, mistress lady-lark, Fly up, fly out of the furrow! And strip your two round shoulders stark, For I your wings would borrow. Ere the east has got a rosy mark, I must bid my love good-morrow. Mistress violet, mistress violet, I want your tender and true eyes! For mine are as cold and as black as jet, And I want your heavenly blue eyes! Modest violet, maiden violet, Pray, can I borrow your blue eyes? Mistress nightingale, mistress nightingale, I want to borrow your fair tongue, For I have to sing a sweeter tale Than ever you in the air sung; Melodious mistress nightingale, Be still, and lend me your fair tongue! Master redbreast, robin redbreast, Whose note has so oft my day cheered, You wear the color my love loves bestâ Will you lend it to a graybeard? Oh, stay, my little man, stay in your nest, And make me brave for a graybeard! Master golden-bill, master golden-bill, Come speak, and tell me whether You will lend, to make me a quill, A hollow silver feather? A letter with love I have to fillâ Say, shall we write together? PICTURES IN THE FIRE. The hickory coals were glowing bright Upon the hearth so broad and wide, And I was sitting in their light, And Elsie by my side. The tangles of her cloudy hair She pushed aside, and just to see More plainly where the pictures were She leaned upon my knee. A rustic boy, with bare, brown feet, Right where the coals were deepest red, Binding up roses among wheat, She saw, so plain, she said. And then to make me see him too, About my neck, with witching grace, She put her arm, and softly drew My face against her face. Ah, is it strange I said I found A picture that was very sweet, But not a rustic boy that bound Roses among his wheat! Dear Elsie, in her modest tire, I painted then with bashful art, And said I saw her in the fire A burning in my heart. And is it strange if new delight Shook out to flowers our budding souls? The while we sat and watched that night For pictures in the coals. MARGARET. Margaret sat in her chamber, Her gilded and garnished chamber, And she made to her heart low hushes, As we sing a babe to rest, And she sighed betwixt her blushes, Oh, where is my own true lover, My beautiful, beautiful lover, My beautiful soldier and lover, My bravest and my best! He is coming, she sang, he is coming! My soldier and lover is coming! My dreams they were wild with warning; Poor heart, beat not so low. See, see! 't is the broad, bright morning! And where are the damp, dim meadows, The blighted and bloomless meadows, Where a shadow, leading shadows, All night I saw him go! So Margaret sat in her chamber, Alone in her lofty chamber, With its crimson carpets glowing, And curtains blue as the sky; And she kept her tears from flowing, And her fears from wild awaking, And her heart from outright breaking With the little song she was making, âO my lover, he could not die!â Again and again she found him, With upturned faces around him, Yet sang she over and over The lullaby song, so sweet: âHe is coming, my soldier and lover! O roses, burst into blooming, And bees, be goldenly humming, To grace and gladden his coming, Whenever the hour shall beat!â SPINNING. Put on the bands! begin, begin! My wheel to-day of itself will spinâ The wool is as white as the daisies; Before the first lark flew at the sky, Lem, my lover, went whistling by, And my cheek yet burns and blazes Like a rose the sunshine praises. Every bird has its throat in tune, The air is sweet as the middle June, And my beautiful morning-glory, Before it was time for the day to break, Opened her blue eyes wide awake To hear the wind's light story, The wooing wind's light story. My cows, their foreheads as soft as silk, Leaned to my hands when I went to milk, And gave me pails-full, and over; And the doves that pecked at the dewy grass, Cooed and fluttered to see me pass, And the bee on the top of the clover Shone with his gold all over. My busy wheel, run fast, run fast! You will bring the shadows straight at last, Aslant from the meadow willows; Then fast, and faster, and faster yet, Till the Day shall turn a somerset Clear into her cloudy pillows, And the stars go to bed in the billows. And when the moon comes up in the skies, And the flowers are shutting their sleepy eyes, And the bee creeps under the cloverâ Oh, then the light will be out in the mill, And a step will be hurrying down the hill, And that will be Lem, my lover! My dear, my darling lover. Then turn by spindle, and off slip band, And idle wheel, at the wall-side stand, And, heart, make tenderest hushes; What though I yet have my gown to spin, He'll kiss my shoulders and hide them in Ripples of rose-red blushesâ And I shall be dressed with blushes. MY ENEMY. Ay, love did make my love of all things fairâ He combed and combed, as fine as threads of silk, The leaves of daffodillies for her hairâ Her little hands compressed of curds of milk, And set her in my path, and made her be, From morn to eve, my sweetest enemy. He laid the leaves of roses in and out From cheek to mouth, to dazzle me with lightâ Round shoulder, throat, I dare not write about, Or guess what place he got so pure a white; But they were all composed to make her be My pretty plagueâmy sweetest enemy. He stole the music of the nightingaleâ Of all best birds, the world of birds among, And made such melodies as cannot fail Of deadly work, to lie upon her tongueâ Built her a casement in the wall whence she Might spread a snare of songsâsweet enemy. Her eyes! To know how I should name her eyes Drives me about the world like one distraughtâ An ever tender infinite surprise Veiled, even as by their lids, with every thought Shaped by my clumsy wits to make you see How that she is my sweetest enemy. I have no refuge from her any more. If toward the house of sleep I take my flight, 'T is her white hand that turneth back the door, Her arms that entertain me all the night, So that her fatal charms do make her be, Even in dreams, my sweetest enemy. THE SAILOR'S CHILD. Over the hilltops, over the mountains, Over the stretches of long, bright lea, There is a dear little, dim little island, Lying asleep in the arms of the sea. Shoulder to shoulder, and never aweary, Roll in the sea-waters, day after day, Fringing this dear little, dim little island All with a wreath of the softest spray. Birds, with wings that are lined with colors, Made of the hues of the morns and eves, Slip and slide like the summer sunshine In and out through the dancing leaves. Over the reaches of green sea-waters, Over the spray-fringe, white as snow, Winds that are laden rich with spices, Go and come, and come and go. Wrapt in a veil that is sown with blossoms, Pink and ivy, apple and rose; Singing loud with the lark at daybreak, Low with the dove at the even-closeâ Waits and watches a sailor's daughter, Who, when the skies of the midnight frown, Charms the demons that love the darkness, And saves the ships that would else go down. Waits and watches a sailor's daughter, Fair as the fairest maidens be, All in this dear little, dim little island, Lying asleep in the arms of the sea. Once this maid had a loyal lover, Born and rocked on the cradling waves, Now he lies with their foam for a cover, Low on the bed of the coral caves. THE LOVER'S MAY-SONG. As after the winter So wild and so dread, One waits by the lily Fast froze in the bed Of the garden, for some Little leaf to appear, So I wait, by my dear. Now soft airs are thawing The icicles down From the eaves, and the swallows So bright and so brown, Ere long in their places Will twitter and sing, Bill to billâwing to wing. The low-cornel up through The dead leaves will shoot, And turn her whole heart Into scarlet-hued fruit, As the sun her white bosom Makes quick with a kissâ Think, my darling, of this! And think of the dear little Rose-colored things, That will lie all atremble Like butterfly wings, Because of their joy in The beds of the moss, And, my love, be not cross. And think of the May-star, That wears, like a queen, Her pearls in a setting Of emerald greenâ How she gathers her tenderness Out of the snow, And you cannot say no. And think of the cool-wort, So timid and sweet, How she cometh almost In the face of the sleet, The grace of her healing On sick hearts to press, And you needs must say yes. LOVE'S SPURNING. Come row in my painted boat, Jane, There 's something I would sayâ 'T is all about your marrying me, And having your own way. The beanfields wrong your little hands, Your feet are cold in the dew, But if you will keep the ring of gold That I have brought for you; No time of merriment shall fall But that you shall be thereâ Your shoulders wrapt in a shawl of lace, And an ivory comb in your hair. Row on in your painted boat, and leave My beanfields in disgraceâ My sweetheart's arm around my neck Is better than all your lace! No ivory comb want I, nor ring, Nor painted boat, so brave, And the way that pleases him is all The way that I care to have. THE RIVALS. You need not stay by my bed, Tommy, My wants are all gone by, And something 's got in my head, Tommy, That makes me wish to die. You need not kiss my face, Tommy, Nor keep your hand on my brow, For see in my eyes the shadow lies, Of another lover, now. Jennie is out at the gate, Tommyâ How fair she looks to-day! My forehead is burning up, Tommy, You must take your hand away! She wears your rose in her hair, Tommyâ 'T is not so sweet as her breath, Nay, do not kiss my mouth, Tommy, I'm almost choked to death! She is coming up this way, Tommyâ I hear her footstep fall;â Straighten me, sweet, from head to feet, And turn me toward the wall. I am saying foolish things, Tommy, I am sick and crazed, you know, But mind, 't is all myself, Tommy, Not you, that makes me so. I wish I had better words, Tommy, To thank you while I live, For being so true, that I to you Have nothing to forgive. Don't fret when I am dead, Tommy,â 'T is sweeter thus to part, Than to be upon my feet, Tommy, If Jennie had your heart. HEART-BROKEN. She sat beneath a willow-treeâ The enamored air scarce dared to stir; The bird sang for her, and the bee Seemed as he worked to work for her. Ah, never was maiden so fair, And the corn was in the milk, And its tassel of bright silk Lying loose on the wind like her hair. Out of the woods a hunter cameâ His bugle to the cadence swung, As artfully he wove her name In the soft ditty that he sung. And a shudder filled all the green place, And the cloud that was at dawn Like the white wing of a swan, Grew black, and o'ershadowed her face. Beneath the willow-tree so low, She layâher hands upon her breast, All cold and white like winter snow Within the last year's empty nest. And the song of the hunter was still, And the blackbird on the thorn Whistled hoarsely, and the corn Rustled withered and dry on the hill. ONCE FOR ALL. 'T was in the bright morning of life and of love, And earth in her springtime was smiling and gay, I walked with my lady A lane green and shady, And all overblown with the rose-leaves of May,â With pale and with bright leaves, With red and with white leaves,â O'erblown and o'erstrown with the roses of May. The sun up the east rode serenely and slow, And swung back the silver-barred gates of the day; 'T was all so ideal That nothing seemed real, And which was the substance we hardly could say, Ourselves, or our shadows, As down the green meadows We walked, through the leaves of the roses of May! All sounds were so sweet, so celestially sweet, We scarce could dissever the grave from the gay. O blending confusions, O darling illusions, That filled up our hearts to o'erflowing that day! Not we, but our shadows, Along the green meadows, Seemed brushing the dew from the daisies away. Like butterfly wings caught with butterfly wings, My fancies in speech fluttered this and that way, As, deep among mazes Of golden-eyed daisies, I said, âWill you love me a little to-day? 'T is only a minute Can have heaven in it; Lady and lady-love, what do you say?â Her spirit stood calm, poised like butterfly wings, And her eyes stabbed me through with a still, steady ray, As turning serenely, And standing so queenly, She said, âLove a little? and just for a day! Why, sir, the rough bramble With scorn stands a-tremble, And blushes up scarlet to hear what you say!â Then, soft as the melting of frost into mist, Her taunt to a tender reproach fell away; âIs love an adorning, To pluck of a morning,â She said, âand to wear like a rose of the May? Love lost is loved neverâ Loved once is loved everâ The joy of eternity, not of a day!â 'T was all in the heyday of life, long ago, And the gold and the black hair are both growing gray, And through the rough weather We walk on together, For the wife of the years is my lady of May; And still she says, ever, âLoved once is loved never,â And I answer, âEternityâthat is love's day!â TRUE LOVE. There is true love, and yet you may Have lingering doubts about it; I'll tell the truth, and simply say That life 's a blank without it. There is a love both true and strong, A love that falters never; It lives on faith, and suffers wrong, But lives and loves forever. Such love is found but once on earthâ The heart cannot repel it; From whence it comes, or why its birth, The tongue may never tell it. This love is mine, in spite of all, This love I fondly cherish; The earth may sink, the skies may fall, This love will never perish. It is a love that cannot die, But, like the soul, immortal, And with it cleaves the starry sky And passes through the portal. This is the love that comes to stayâ All other loves are fleeting; And when they come, just turn awayâ It is but Cupid cheating. THE FATAL ARROW. My father had a fair-haired harvester;â I gleaned behind him in the barley-land; And there he put a red rose in my hand: Oh, cruel, killing leaves those rose-leaves were! He sang to me a little love-lorn lay, Learned of some bird; and while his sickle swept Athwart the shining stalks, my wild heart kept Beating the tune up with him all the way. One time we rested by a limpid stream, O'er which the loose-tongued willows whispered low; Ah, blessed hour! so long and long ago, It cometh back upon me like a dream. And there he told me, blushing soft,âah me!â Of one that he could love,âso young, so fair, Like mine the color of her eyes and hair: O foolish heart! I thought that I was she! Full flowed his manly beard; his eyes so brown Made sweet confession with their tender look; A thousand times I kissed him in the brook, Across the flowers,âwith bashful eyelids down. And even yet I cannot hear the stir Of willows by a water but I stop, And down the warm waves all their length I drop My empty arms, to find my harvester. In all his speech there was no word to mend; Whate'er he said, or right or wrong, was best, Until at last an arrow pierced my breast, Tipt with a fatal point,âhe called me friend! Still next my heart the fading rose I wore, But all so sad; full well I knew, God wot, That I had been in love and he had not, And in the barley-field I gleaned no more.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">RELIGIOUS POEMS AND HYMNS. A PRAYER. My weary head hath lain a weary year On these hot pillows, and most fearful fears Have made my eyes acquainted with such tears As lie to utter sadness very near. No coverlid, with borders like the spring When roses come, and up and down o'erspread With golden lilies, maketh fair my bed, But only darkness is my covering. No daybreak gladness cometh with the dayâ No pictured saint, so sweet and so divine, Maketh the corners of my room to shine When evening falleth round me, cold and gray. Steps, eager once, have taken a listless fallâ And eyes that seemed to give me tender grace Have found their pleasure in another faceâ Only its echo answers back my call. Some dread enchantment, all against my will, Hath wrought this cruel charm against my life, And vain are all my struggles, vain my strifeâ Hear me, my Master, hear and help me still! Thou, who to light immortal life didst bring, Rising from death, to walk and talk with men, And teach the lesson, all unlearned till thenâ The gain of loss and cross and sufferingâ Let not my sinful soul forsaken be! This is my prayer all night, and all the day, What is there I have heavier need to say? My very hopes are only mine through Thee! Brother and friend, the dear familiar face, The eyes belovedâlet each and all departâ Nor shall I yet be sad, or sick of heart, So Thou but have, and hold me in Thy grace. GOING DOWN. When, like the sinking sun, the year goes down From the delighting of her flowery day; While mists crawl coldly on, and leaves grow brown, And all the golden glory dies away; When we do see the monstrous might of death In all that lately did so sweetly shine,â Then do we lean our ear down close to faith, And ask for evidence of things divine. Ask for a glimpse of that substantial land Where no sad eyes are turned upon the past; Where the loose footing of this mortal sand Is builded to a rock that standeth fast. Where even the memory of fear is o'er, Where no rough wind nor rising cloud alarms, And where our darlings never, never more Shall flee away like shadows from our arms. For through the mournful fading of the wood, And through the sickly flowers that cease to please, It slowly cometh to be understood That somewhere there are better things than these. But if there were continuance of delights, The rock beneath us in the stead of sands, Ah! should we seek to climb the rugged heights Whereon the everlasting city stands! Then fade, O flowery wreath that summer weaves, And pleasant greenness, vanish from our sight, Since through the thinning of the earthly leaves There breaketh in upon us heavenly light. DEATHLESS FLOWERS. I tell you God is good, as well as just, And some few flowers in every heart are sown, Their black and crumpled leaves show but as dust, Sometimes in the hard soilâsometimes o'ergrown With wild, unfriendly weeds, they hidden lie From the warm sunshine, but they do not die. Pressed from a natural quickening by the might Of sin, or circumstance, through the evil days, They find their way at last into the light, Weakly and pale, giving their little praise Of modest beauty, and with grace most sweet Making the garden of the Lord complete. A VISION. Once kneeling with my soul alone, When all was dark as dark may be, A great light round about me shone, And God the Spirit came to me. Along my garden, where there grew Sharp thistles at the daylight's close, In the clear morning, wet with dew, Came up the cedar and the rose. Ambition, prideâhow dwarfed and vain! And from my forehead, bowed in prayer, Fell off the burning crown of pain, And God the Son was with me there. No more with sinful sorrow bowed, How pleasant seemed the Christian strife! The angel coming in the cloud Had brightened all the hills of life. I saw the bruisÃ¨d serpent go From Eden, lately darkly dim; Man to his ancient stature grow, And God the Father talk with him. Was some great inspiration there That o'er me never more shall be? Or could I make my life as fair As in that vision, Holy Three? SHAPING INFLUENCES. Lead me, O my guardian angel, So I pray, and ever pray, Where the light winds sing their lightest, Where the bright things bloom their brightest, And the flowery fields of May Stretch away, and still away! Lead and leave me, O my angel, Where the wild birds, day by day, Chirp and sing their light love-stories, All among the golden glories Of the flowery fields of May, Stretched away, and still away! Where the rose doth wear her blushes Like a garment, and the fair And modest violets sit together, Weaving in the mild May weather Purples, out of dew and air, Fit for any queen to wear. But, my angel, my good angel, This much more I have to sayâ O'er the blooming and the singing, O'er the weaving and the winging, Grant to live with me, I pray, In these flowery fields of May; Friends to love with love that only Lives of men and women swayâ Over and above the hushes Of all birds, above the blushes Of the reddest rose in Mayâ And yet once again I pray, That when thou shalt give them to me, Alway, heart in heart to beat, They shall make all flowery places Fairer for their smiling faces, And whatever things are sweetâ Brighter, better, more complete. Not for time and sense, O angel, Dare I thus entreat of thee Into flowery fields to take meâ 'T is the things I see that make me For the things I cannot seeâ For the long eternity. HYMN. When earthly pleasures fade and flee, When clouds of care obscure the light, Uplift thine eyes, O man, and see The long sweet day beyond the night. When summer's soft delights are gone, And flowers are closed in icy walls, Think of the beauteous hills whereon The frost of winter never falls. When the fierce tempest mows a path Of dreadful darkness through the land, Remember, thou of little faith, Who holds the whirlwind in His hand. When pestilence infects the air, And the beloved lies smitten sore, Think of the heavenly country where The inhabitants are sick no more. And when thy good days all are run Even to the last low fluttering breath, Know, sinking soul, that pain is done, That dying is the death of death. LIGHT AND DARKNESS. The sun is shining bright, so bright, And the bee to the rose is humming, But the day is hurrying down to the night, And the cloud and the storm are coming; So, little bee, hum sweetly on, For the day of the rose will soon be gone. The leaves are green, so green in the wood, And the bird is wildly winging His way in the air, for he maketh good His little time of singing; Right on, my pretty one, right on! For the light o' the summer will soon be gone. The blood is bright in the young man's heart, And his footstep gayly roameth, But he and his pleasure soon must part, For the enemy surely cometh: So, light young heart, beat lightly on, Ere the time for the dreaming of dreams be gone. The frost it falls on the brightest tress, And sweetness is mixed with sadness, But the maiden seweth her bridal dress, And maketh her veil with gladness; And whether the rain or the sunshine fall. The holy heaven is over it all. The body lies in a lowly bed, And the darkness is its cover, But the soul shall safe through the night be fed, And the Lord shall be her lover; For He who promised us life shall keep His promises, whether we wake or sleep. CHRISTMAS EVE. No flowers were left in the meadows; All empty and cold was the nest; And the sun, in a white, cold bank of light, Was going down in the west. 'T was the day before the Christmas; And with young hearts all astir, Now turning the reel and now the wheel, And making the spindle whir, We two were alone in the garretâ My playmate Harley and I; But the light sped fast, and we ceased at last From making the spindle fly. Yet still through the darkening window (You might cover it all with your hands) We could see the wood, where the schoolhouse stood, With its border of level lands. We could tell the elms from the walnuts, And the oaks from all the rest, As covered with snow and row after row They shimmered against the west. We could see the barn with great square door, And the stacks that beyond it rose, The open sheds full of skeleton sleds, And harrows and plows and hoes. We could see the horns of the cattle As they tossed o'er the hay-filled racks, Where together they fed with head over head, And saddles of snow on their backs. Like pillars of salt in the garden, We could see the hives of the bees, And hear the wind's song as it hurried along To waltz with the tops of the trees. We could see o'er the roofs of the village The old St. Xavier's shine, The Paternity, and the Holy Three, With its steeple tall and fine. And my playmate Harley questioned: âCan there be three Gods above? Then how shall we pray, and who shall say Which one is the God of Love?â And hand in hand from the window, As sunk the sun from the earth, We crossed the room, now dim with gloom, And kneeling beside the hearth, We gathered the faded embers All out of their ashen bed, And blew and blew, on our knees, we two, Till the flame shot up, blood-red. âNow, then,â said my playmate Harley. âI will find it out for myself!â And he gave a look to the old, old Book That lay on the dusty shelf. And so, one over the other, He piled up chair upon chair, Then up he stept and on he crept To the top of the trembling stair. Then down with the Book on his shoulder, And back to the fire he came, And so, eager-eyed, he held it wide With page aslant to the flame. Leaf after leaf of the yellow leaves He turned them o'er so fast, Till at length he said, with uplifted head:â âI have found it out at last âIn the prayer which the Lord and Master Has taught us all to say; For surely He, if He prayed to three, Would have taught us so to pray! âAnd I don't care now if the steeples Be three, or six, or seven!ââ And he read so loud it was almost proudâ âOur Father who art in Heaven.â And there in the dim old garret, While the winds the rafters shook, And with head bent low to the firelight glow, And our two cheeks, over the Book, Like a rose that is growing double,â We read, in an under-breath, Of the holy morn when Christ was born, And of all his life and death. How He gave himself our ransom, And drank to the very brim The bitter cup, to lift us up, The whole great world, to Him. And full and sweet was the comfort Of the faith that there and then To our hearts we took, as we closed the Book With an all unbreathed Amen. And many and many a Christmas Has come and gone with its light, And all the years, through smiles or tears, We have kept the old faith bright. HIDDEN THINGS. The lily she has gone to bed, And the little meadow-mouse Has thatched the roof above her head, And carpeted her house All soft and warm, because she knows The clouds will shortly bring the snows. That solemn bird that loves so well To be superbly dressed, Has taken his gorgeous chasuble And left an empty nest; He knows, the lily being gone, That winter will come whistling on. The partridge now has ceased to drum, And the bee, so sweet and brown, Has left the barley-fields, and come To her humming-house in town; Her honeyed joys aforetime planned, And all these things I understand. But I neither understand nor know, Though I strive with all my care, When I do see the winter snow A-gathering on my hair; And see my youth quite fled away, Why I do wish, nay, long to stay! I know that only virtues thrive, And know that folly hath no praise; Yet, as the foolish women live, I live, nor seek to mend my ways. This is the mystery that I call The hardest, saddest of them all. I know that I must shortly lie In the cold silence of the grave, And I believe He reigns on high Who died, and rose, and lives to save; Yea, I believe, yet cry in grief, Help, Lord, help thou mine unbelief! HEAVEN OUR HOME. The fields with flowers a-blowing, They all behind us lieâ Our autumn, it draweth nigh; But oh, my friends, we are going To the summer hills on high! We are vexed with wars and warringâ Our strifes with our days increase, But there cometh a swift releaseâ For oh, my friends, we are nearing The life of eternal peace! Our roof-tree drops asunderâ Our floor-planks slide like sandsâ In our doors the darkness stands; But oh, my friends, there is splendor In the house not made with hands! We know no full completeness;â In the sky of the day most clear Some shadow is sure to appear; But oh, my friends, there is sweetness In the days of the endless year. The winds are beating and blowingâ The frost on our heads is whiteâ We are drawing near to the night; But oh, my friends, we are going To the morning land of light! In spite of the fast possession, Our thoughts they flutter and flee, Like wild birds out to seaâ For we long to know the fashion Of the life that is to be. Our golden gains we are losing, Our hopes are dim with dust, But oh, my friends, we trust What seemeth lost is for using Where there is nor moth nor rust. Our life is a twice-told story That charm no longer lends; But oh, my friends, my friends, We are coming close to the glory That never fades nor ends. We stand of our strength forsaken, And sick unto death, in sooth, But this we know of a truth, That out of the dust we shall waken, To a life of immortal youth. The winter brings rough weather, And into the chill and the gloom We go, and we never come; But oh, my friends, we shall gather Together in Heavenâour home.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">POEMS FOR CHILDREN. FAINT PRAISE. Our Tabby she is very wise, And also very nice, But I must say that I despise Her way of eating mice: For if I was a cat I would n't do that! She lies with head so low and meek Between her paws of silk, But then she has a thievish trick Of lapping at the milk; And if I was a cat I would n't do that! 'T is well enough to know your strength; But she abuses power, And worries at a mouse the length Sometimes of half an hour. Now if I was a cat I would n't do that! Her coat is modest, sober gray, Set off with jetty spots, But then she has a sloven way Of rubbing on the pots; And if I was a cat I would n't do that! The fur is soft upon her breast As froth upon the pail, But then to match against the rest She has an ugly tail; And if I was a cat I would n't have that! THREE MILLERS. There once were three millers, A long time ago, And one was named Peter, One John, and one Joe. They all lived together, And worked just as one, But the mill was owned wholly By Joseph and John. âThe world is before usâ Our way is to win,â Said Peter, who owned but The beard on his chin. âAnd I mean, for my part, With God's help and grace, To hold to my manhood, And stick to my place.â The mill was a good mill, And all the folks round, Who were farmers, brought thither Their grain to be ground. So 't was not uncommon To see at the door Three carts and six oxenâ There sometimes were more. And all through the autumn, At night and at morn, The mill-door was garnished With bags full of corn,â While bushels of millet, Of rye, and of wheat, Gave token of plenty, To have and to eat. But Joseph took all this Good fortune for ill, And sold out to Peter His share in the mill. 'T was slow work and weary To grind for his bread; He would go where the gold Grew on bushes, he said. âYou had better stay with us,â Said Peter; but no, âI will gather my gold from The bushes,â says Joe. So Peter wrought on with A resolute will, Though there were by two hands The less in the mill. And still the mill prospered, And all the folks said, âThese sturdy young fellows Are getting ahead!â Then John fell a-moping, And saying, âDon't care!â And offered to sell out To Peter his share. âI hate the hard mill work,â He says, âand will go And gather my gold from The bushes, with Joe!â Then Peter, half angry, Half sorrowful, said, âWell, don't you come back here A-begging for bread!â âNot I!â answered John; âI may come back to lend.â But Peter said, âWork, sir, Is best in the end!â So John, after Joe, turned His back on the mill, And Peter wrought on As before, with a will. And when he was lonesome, And when he was sad, He would say that his work Was the best friend he had. Some said he was foolish, Some said he was wise; Some thought of the bushes, With tears in their eyes. But when twenty years, like The mill-wheel, had turned, And a snug little fortune Our Peter had earned,â All comers said, shaking Him hard by the hand, That there was n't a gold-bearing Bush in the land! One night, when the wind blew As hard as could be, And a terrible moaning Came up from the sea,â As he sat by the chimney, And read the good Book, There came such a knocking, The door fairly shook. Then straight little Peter Got out of his bedâ The curls, bright as meal-dust, All over his head,â And stood at his father's knee Sucking his thumb, With blue eyes wide open To see who had come,â While the mother upon the Hot coals left her cake, And opened the door wide For charity's sake. Then spoke a low voice, All a-tremble with fear, âCan you tell if one Peter, A miller, live near? âWe are poor men, half frozen, And starving for bread.â âMy brothers!â cried Peter; âAlive, and not dead!â For, wasted and hungry, And coated with snow, His loving eyes knew them For John and for Joe. And the wife, all in tears, Took her cake from the coals, Smoking hot, saying, âEat, And be welcome, dear souls.â Then Peter, one cheek to the Bright little face That was leaned to his own, Asked a blessing of grace. And shamed the two who sat At his feast, as they told Of the long, fruitless search For the bushes of gold;â Of the years they had wasted, The hopes they had spent, And come back a thousand Times worse than they went! âNay, brothers, take courage,â Says Peter, at length; âThe weakness repented, We turn into strength. âOurselves, not our stars, Make our fates, in the end, And hence it is never Too late to amend.â GRANDFATHER'S PICTURE. âWhy, here's grandfather! and the snow A foot deep on the ground! Still younger than the youngest of His children, I'll be bound. Rash, after nightfall, even for you, To face out such a squall. Now was n't it, dear grandfather?â âTut, tut! boy, not at all!â âWhy, when we kept your birthday last, 'T was Christmas, seems to me, Nearly a year ago; and then You passed for seventy-three! The air is blind, and I should judge That where the ground is flat, The drifts are gathered two feet deepââ âAy, sir; and what of that? âWhen I was young as you are now, 'T was just our dear delight To take our guns and dogs, and tree A bear on such a night! I know once Johnny Horn and Iâ You mind old Johnny Horn?â âOh, no; I 've heard you say he died The year that I was born.â âAy, ay; I have n't seen his face These dozen years, I knowââ âThese dozen years? I'm thirty-five!â âWell, well, boy, let it go! I meant to tell about the bear We killed. But never mind: Folks don't care any more, it seems, To stop and look behind.â âI do, you know, dear grandfather; But here 's your chair,âsit down And tell us what's the news at home; Or have you been to town With Uncle Sam, or Benjamin, To see the sights?âââWhy, no! Besides, sir, I could go alone, If I should choose to go! âThe townâwhat care I for the town? They 've got no shows, I doubt, Worth going after; none, at least, That I can't do without.â âBut, grandfather, they've got that witchâ You know the one I mean?â âOf Endor? Poh, poh! what is she To witches I have seen! âThere was your grandmotherâall tongues Were ringing with her praise The night she danced with meâyou 've got No dancers nowadays; And there was Betsy Byarâa neck As graceful as a swan; And Mistress Motleyâwho was 't said That she was dead and gone?â âBut, grandfather, about the shows! They talk of four or five New cherubs in the Academy, That seem almost alive!â âAnd what o' that? I'll venture now That since the sun was down I've seen as fine a picture As the finest in the town.â âWhat was it, grandfather?âââWhy, this: Upon my way to-night I stopt at Benjamin's, to see That everything was right. And there, his little girl upon His knee, sat Ben, and read, His chin propt up above the page Upon her golden head. âAnd upright in the cradle, all As quiet as a lamb, The baby, with his wide eyes toward The shadow on the jamb; While Jerry down among his books, Along the floor lay flat, One hand upon the open page, And one upon the cat. âThe logs were heapt, and on the hearth, As bright as bright could be, The teakettle was humming to The tune of coming tea: And wife and mother filled the while The house with her reposeâ The brown bands round her face like rings Of bees about a rose. âIt seemed to me the very clock Perceived the scene was fair, And counted off the minutes just As slowly as she dare. The moaning of the homeless wind, The snowflakes, as they drove In clouds across the panes, enhanced The warmth, the light, the love. âA pretty story, to be sure, If I must scour the land For pictures, having such an one A stone's throw from my hand!â âI think you 're right, dear grandfather: I have n't seen the one That outshines this of yoursââââWhat 's more, You never will, my son!â</field>
