      <field name="fulltext">SAY, CHARLIE Say, Charlie, our Charlie, say, What of the night? A-lo-ha! Hail! What noonful sea? What restful sail? Where tent you, Bedouin, to-day? O generous green leaves of our tree, What fruitful first young buoyant year! But bleak winds blow; the leaves are sere, And listless rustle two or three. Say, Charlie, where is Bret and Twain? Shy Prentice, and the former few? You spoke and spoke as one who knewâ Now, Charlie, speak us once again! The night-wolf prowls; we guess, we grope, But day is night and night despair, And doubt seems some unuttered prayer, And hope seems hoping against hope. But, Charlie, you had faith, and you, Gentlest of all God's gentlemen, You said you knew and surely knewâ Now speak, and speak as spoke you then. Joaquin Miller. AT ANCHOR In Memory of Charles Warren Stoddard, Author of âSouth Sea Idyls.â Swing to the harbor from the deep of sea, O sail of mine, but hold the sea in sight! These are my fronded palms, my cocoa tree, And these the islands of my heart's delight! My lift of emerald hills against the blue From blue; the feathery mists of waterfalls; The wingÃ©d gems that flash the foliage through, Filling the air with fluted madrigals. The wash of waves upon the coral reef,â O song familiar of the long ago!â The lap of waves, where blade and lance and leaf, Fringing the water's rim, are glassed below. And here my tawny comrades laugh, and reach Warm hands to mine,âthe dear brown hands I knewâ With glad, glad greetings in soft-voweled speech, From hearts that have remembered and been true. Long have I wandered, tossed by stormy tides, Benumbed in calms,âbut here, how sure the sea! Furl the worn sails,âthe ship at anchor rides,â Leave me with these! Leave me to these and Thee! Ina Coolbrith. CHARLES WARREN STODDARD The Poet of the South Seas, 1843â1909. Thine exile ended,âO belovÃ©d seer,â Thou turnest homeward to thine isles of light; Thy reefs of silver, and palmetto height! Yea, down thy vales sonorous thou wouldst hear Again the cataracts that white and clear Called from young daysâoh, with what loving might!â That from our arms and this embattled night Thou break'st away and leav'st us sobbing here. Vain the laudation!âWhat are crowns and praise To thee whom Youth anointed on the eyes? We have but known the lesser heart of thee Whose spirit bloomed in lilies down the ways Of Padua; whose voice perpetual sighs On Molokai in tides of melody. EXILE ENDEDâ1909 Friend, they have led thee far, the voices fond From peak and strand through all the thousand isles Abloom with wreaths and kisses, lit with smiles And vast Alohas calling from beyond! Yet wouldst thou once again be vagabond 'Neath that eternal star which ne'er beguiles; Thy foot hath learned to tread the lily files That sway thy Padua as with silver wand; Round Molokai of martyrs hath thy sail Been benediction;âDreamer, whither now With heart unquenchÃ©d wouldst thou make away?â For what new sphere of sapphireâwhat regale Of seraphim Alohas hath thy brow Foregone the plaudits, the pale wreaths to-day? Thomas Walsh. CHARLES WARREN STODDARD O Muse! within thy western hall, To mellow chord and crystal string, At many harps thy chosen sing: His was the gentlest soul of all. He sang not as the leaping faun By voiceless rivers cool and clear, Nor yet as chants the visioned seer When darkness trembles with the dawn. A milder music held his lyreâ A wistful strain, all human-sweet, Between the ashes at our feet And stars that pass in alien fire. His skies were somber, but he lit His garden with a lamp of gold Where tropic laughters left untold The sadness buried in his wit. Lonely, he harbored to the last A boyish spirit, large and droll; Tardy of flesh and swift of soul, He walked with angels of the Past. With tears his laurels still are wet; But now we smile, whose hearts have known The fault that harmed himself alone,â The art that left a world in debt. Of all he said, I best recall: âHe knows the sky who knows the sod, And he who loves a flower, loves God.â Sky, flower and sod, he loved them all. From all he wrote (not for his day), A sense of marvel drifts to meâ Of morning on a purple sea, And fragrant islands far away. George Sterling. POEMS OF CHARLES WARREN STODDARD THE BELLS OF SAN GABRIEL (The Mission of San Gabriel ArcÃ¡ngel, near Los Angeles, founded in 1771, was, for a time, the most flourishing mission in California.) Thine was the corn and the wine, The blood of the grape that nourished; The blossom and fruit of the vine That was heralded far away. These were thy gifts; and thine, When the wine and the fig-tree flourished, The promise of peace and of glad increase Forever and ever and aye. What then wert thou, and what art now? Answer me O, I pray! And every note of every bell Sang Gabriel! rang Gabriel! In the tower that is left the tale to tell Of Gabriel, the Archangel. Oil of the olive was thine; Flood of the wine-press flowing, Blood of the Christ was the wineâ Blood of the Lamb that was slain. Thy gifts were fat of the kine Forever coming and going Far over the hills, the thousand hillsâ Their lowing a soft refrain. What then wert thou, and what art now? Answer me, once again! And every note of every bell Sang Gabriel! rang Gabriel! In the tower that is left the tale to tell Of Gabriel, the Archangel. Seed of the corn was thineâ Body of Him thus broken And mingled with blood of the vineâ The bread and the wine of life. Out of the good sunshine They were given to thee as a tokenâ The body of Him, and the blood of Him, When the gifts of God were rife. What then wert thou, and what art now After the weary strife? And every note of every bell Sang Gabriel! rang Gabriel! In the tower that is left the tale to tell Of Gabriel, the Archangel. Where are they now, O bells? Where are the fruits of the Mission? Garnered, where no one dwells, Shepherd and flock are fled. O'er the Lord's vineyard swells The tide that with fell perdition Sounded their doom and fashioned their tomb And buried them with the dead. What then wert thou, and what art now? The answer is still unsaid. And every note of every bell Sang Gabriel! rang Gabriel! In the tower that is left the tale to tell Of Gabriel, the Archangel. Where are they now, O tower! The locusts and wild honey? Where is the sacred dower That the bride of Christ was given? Gone to the wielders of power, The misers and minters of money; Gone for the greed that is their creedâ And these in the land have thriven. What then wert thou, and what art now, And wherefore hast thou striven? And every note of every bell Sang Gabriel! rang Gabriel! In the tower that is left the tale to tell Of Gabriel, the Archangel. ALBATROSS Time cannot age thy sinews, nor the gale Batter the network of thy feathered mail, Lone sentry of the deep! Among the crashing caverns of the storm, With wing unfettered, lo! thy frigid form Is whirled in dreamless sleep! Where shall thy wing find rest for all its might? Where shall thy lidless eye, that scours the night, Grow blank in utter death? When shall thy thousand years have stripped thee bare, Invulnerable spirit of the air, And sealed thy giant-breath? Not till thy bosom hugs the icy waveâ Not till thy palsied limbs sink in that grave, Caught by the shrieking blast, And hurled upon the sea with broad wings locked, On an eternity of waters rocked, Defiant to the last! PALM OF THE SEA Palm of the Sea! O, living lyric of repose eternalâ Born of the elements and full of grace; Happy art thou where'er thy dwelling placeâ Thou, and the sombre Syrians, when they stood Beside the way, a saintly sisterhood, Wearing triumphantly their wreaths supernal. Happy their life, happy their death and sweet, For their plucked boughs have kissed the Saviour's feet. Palm of the Sea! O, virgin palm, upon thy rocky throne Transfigured in the sun's serene baptism, Thy pillar a pure flame, and every leaf a prism Fretting the shadow of thy emerald zone: In thy deep joy, thus heavenly arrayed, Wrapped in celestial silence, undismayed, Sole in the far oasis, all thine ownâ An angel waiting in a desert lone! Palm of the Sea! Out of the purple gulfs of Ocean reaching, Like to a soul aspiring and beseeching, O'er the glazed wave thy mirrored form is shed. In the glad hour, when sorrows all grow old, Against the shining gates I shall behold Thy leaves of silver and thy stem of gold: I shall behold that crown upon thy head, When the graves yawn and seas give up their dead! ONE LIFE Upon the woven leaf, Upon the veinÃ©d flower, I find my life portrayed in briefâ My life from hour to hour. A frail leaf fit to die; A young bud fed with dew, The faithful air of heaven by, While no wind roughly blew. All day for my delight, From dark to dark my own; One butterfly delaying flight, That left me not alone. A humming-bird to float Upon a breath; a bee To blow a long complaining note, Invited were of me. A rill below a rock, A pool to revel in, A lonely lad, a wandering flock, Were all my kith and kin. A tropic time of growth, A twilight long and mild; Delay, O Autumn! I am loth To leave thee, well beguiled. Forbid a leaf to fade, Forbid a bough to fall, Until one perfect bloom be made, More beautiful than all. I know that Time and Death Will wither me away, Yet of that perfect flower one breath May brighten all the day. THE DAUGHTER OF PHARAOH TO BOHEMIA Read on the occasion of the presentation of a mummy to the Bohemian Club, San Francisco, California, by Jeremiah Lynch, Esq. Wherefore these revels that my dull eyes greet? These dancers, dancing at my fleshless feet; The harpers, harping vainly at my ears Deaf to the world, lo! thrice a thousand years? Time was when even I was blithe: I knew The murmur of the flowing wave, where grew The lean, lithe rushes; I have heard the moan Of Nilus in prophetic undertone. My sire was monarch of a mighty race: Daughter of Pharaoh, I; before my face Myriads of groveling creatures crawled, to thrust Their fearful foreheads in the desert dust. Above me gleamed and glowed my palace walls: There bloomed my bowers; and there my waterfalls Lulled me in languors; slaves with feather flails Fretted the tranquil air to gentle gales. O, my proud palms! my royal palms, that stood In stately groups, a queenly sisterhood! And O! my sphinxes, gazing eye in eye, Down the dim vistas of eternity. Where be you now? And where am I at last? With gay Bohemia is my portion cast; Born of the oldest East, I seek my rest In the fair city of the youngest West. Farewell, O Egypt! Naught can thee avail; What tarries now to tell thy sorry tale? A sunken temple that the sands have hid! The tapering shadow of a pyramid! And now, my children, harbour me not ill; I was a princess, am a woman still. Gibe me no gibes, but greet me at your best, As I was wont to greet the stranger guest. Feast well, drink well, make merry while you may, For e'en the best of you must pass my way. The elder as the youngster, fair to see, Must gird his marble loins and follow me. ALMA NATURA Come from the vales of grief, O Pilgrim, I implore thee! Let me tell How I have sought and found my full relief; For Nature loves us well. Look at thine own disgrace, O foolish Pilgrim, fainting in thy soul! Let but the sweet air breathe upon thy face And it shall make thee whole. Bare thy close-shodden feet; Put off thy raiment; naked, free, and glad, Walk with the shining angels Light and Heat, For thou art fitly clad. Bathe in the running tide; O seek it with a lover's heart, for lo! Thou shalt arise from out it purified, And whiter than the snow. Pause in the orchard path; Pluck from the bough the fruit's untainted flesh, Eat freely, for a copious store it hath: Then live and love afresh. Seek thou the ocean's flood, And as the sun glows on the crystal brink Seize thou the golden chalice of his blood And thirsting, deeply drink. Through Nature art thou blest: She clothes thee, and she feeds thee, and she gives Drink to the lips that thirst, and perfect rest To every one that lives. EXPECTATION What news, I wonder, from the South! I saw a sail blow past the Head. I wonder if my lovers still Are watching for me from the hill, Whereon the palms are dry with drouth, And ferns are crisp and dead. I wonder if my lovers yet Are all beginning to forget How dear that day was when we sat Upon our Island Ararat, While floods were beating at its base, And winds in anger seemed to fret Our new-found dwelling place! The bark was driving on the beach; How far life seemed beyond our reach! The shore was thronged with savage men; They plunged into the surf, and then, Above the breakers' deafening roar, They gave us each some cheering speech, And helped us to the shore. What sweet, unprofitable hours We passed within the silent land: Calm, or impatient, sadly mute, Or merry in a mild dispute; Long days of summer, ripe and hale, Horizons all hemmed in with flowers, Till, rescued by a passing sail, We gave each dusky friend a hand, And parted on the sand. I wonder how my lovers are! I wonder if the lime has shed The name I cut upon its bark! I wonder if they speared the shark We chased one night by torch and starâ He had our pet kid in his mouth! The sea rolls in with easy swell; I saw a sail blow past the Head; âShe's from the Line,â I heard it saidâ And there is where my lovers dwell, Along the burning South. THE COCOA TREE Cast on the water by a careless hand Day after day the winds persuaded me: Onward I drifted till a coral tree Stayed me among its branches, where the sand Gathered about me, and I slowly grew, Fed by the constant sun and the inconstant dew. The sea birds build their nests against my root, And eye my slender body's horny case. Widowed within this solitary place Into the thankless sea I cast my fruit; Joyless I thrive, for no man may partake Of all the store I bear and harvest for his sake. No more I heed the kisses of the morn; The harsh winds rob me of the life they gave; I watch my tattered shadow in the wave, And hourly droop and nod my crest forlorn, While all my fibres stiffen and grow numb Beck'ning the tardy ships, the ships that never come. TO THE UNSEEN I know of One who is so true to me, We may not parted be. Though I have strayed on to the uttermost, Yet is His voice not lost. If I am madly-deaf, for having erred, Still may I hear His word. If I have sinned, behold a crimson floodâ The river of His blood, Wherein I find redemption: tenderly He wooes my fear away, And searches out some star of hope above, So boundless is His love. Though I am weak, there is a hope of power: He is my mighty tower. Like as the sun that frights the gloom away, He is my perfect day. E'en as the moon that is the charm of night, He is my full delight. His beauty lights a mansion in the skyâ Alas! and what am I? IN VACATION The sun has marked me for his own; I'm growing browner day by day: I cannot leave the fields alone; I bring their breath away. I put aside the forms of men, And shun the world's consuming care. Come, green and honest hills again! For you are free and fair. How wonderful this pilgrimage! On every side new worlds appear. I weigh the wisdom of the sage, And find it wanting here. I crave the tongues that Adam knew, To question and discourse with these,â To taunt the jay with jacket blue, And quarrel with the bees. To answer when the grosbeak calls His mate; to mock the catbird's screech; The sloven crow's, with nasal drawls, The oriole's golden speech. Now through the pasture, and across The brook, while flocks of sparrows try To quit the world, and wildly toss Their forms against the sky. A small owl from the thistle-tops Makes eyes at me, with blank distrust, Tips off upon the air, and drops Flat-footed in the dust. The meadow-lark lifts shoulder-high Above the sward, and, quivering With broken notes of ecstasy, Slants forth on curved wing. The patient barn-fowls strut about, Intent on nothing every one. A tall cock hails a cock without, A grave hen eyes the sun. The gobbler swells his shaggy coat, Portentous of a conquest sure; His houris pipe their treble note Round-shouldered and demure. The clear-eyed cattle calmly stop To munch the dry husk in the rack; Or stretch their solid necks, and crop The fringes of the stack. But night is coming, as I think; The moving air is growing cool; I hear the hoarse frog's hollow chink Around the weedy pool. The sun is down, the clouds are grey, The cricket lifts his trembling voice. Come back again, O happy day, And bid my heart rejoice! MOODS I O my belovÃ©d, e'er the sun is down, Where is my young renown? O dear belovÃ©d, e'er the day is past, Where is my portion cast? If I have falsely sung I sought amendsâ Yet still the sun descends. And I have striven hard and constantly, Yet still the day goes by. What is a lamp unto my stumbling feet, With life no longer sweet? The stars, in differing glories, what are they To the good warmth of day? Where is my lacking, that the world denies Unto my art the prize? Gird me about with wings that I may speed, Touching the stars, indeed. Strong is the spirit, is the flesh so weak? O best belovÃ©d, speak! Is there no gift in store for such as I? BelovÃ©d love, reply. II O my belovÃ©d, though the night were here, Still could thy presence cheer. False is the smile of Fame, and soon obscure, How doth thy light endure! Fame beckons all and courts the multitude: How doth thy love exclude! How doth thy love exclude all, saving me, I kept unworthilyâ Retained, made richer by endowment, filled Full of thy grace, yet skilled To walk in modesty. O perfect heart Night is not where thou art! How can I comprehend and value thee Out of my poverty? Amid thy lavish elements disbursed, I faint and am a-thirst? Too prodigal of sweets to satisfyâ Drinking, I still am dry! And hunger ever though forever fed, BelovÃ©d! belovÃ©d! THE AWAKENING I touched the shore in other climes Encompassed by warm leagues of sea; I breathed the spicy breath of limes The sauntering gales bore down to me. A hundred palms with feathered tips Displayed their fair pavilion screens Upon the yellow sandy slips; Beyond the beating barks were seen. And as the barks were blown across The summer-blue of ocean's breast, My thoughts were borne about to toss Among the currents of unrest. My hammock swung within a shade, I loosed my thoughts where they would rove, Then sounds were hushed, the ships did fade, I slumbered in the musky grove. I dreamed, and all my thoughts returned Across the far-dividing deep, And that dear land for which I yearned I seemed to find in fevered sleep. In dreams I reached my native shore, I found the year in deep decline, The desolate, dull landscape bore No hopeful look to answer mine. I faltered then and prayed for hopeâ And hope is his whoever wills; With half a hundred doubts to cope I strode across the bronze-brown hills. Then seeking with impulsive haste Some phantom that my brain had wrought, Old, dear familiar streets I paced, But missed forever what I sought. Where were the faces that I knew? Where were the hearts that I could trust? Below the dark and lonely yew Was heaped away their hallowed dust. âO Christ!â I cried, âwho died for us That we might live; one only kiss From those mute lips!â âWhy sorrow thus? There is another life than thisââ A mellow voice of heavenly calm With its annunciation spilled Soft chrism oils, and straight a balm Fell on me, and my pain was stilled. But then I pleaded: âTake me hence To glorify Thee and adore, For what are actions or events With kindred gone forevermore?â The voice replied: âNo action dies Although forgotten long, it still A sure conviction shall ariseâ A spirit working good or ill.â Then shame smote crimson down my face, I hastened from the place of tombs, A lighter heart bespoke me grace, I doffed my dismal cloak of glooms. I cried: âI will rejoice to do Such deeds that nothing ill shall dare To stand erected in the view Of the new legend, fresh and fair.â Then swinging in my hammock, hung In arbors filled with fine perfume, My pulses quickened as they sung: âWe shall anon this task assume.â And swaying with the swaying boughs, With odors of the fruit and flower About me, tempting me to drowse Forever in the scented bower, There came a voice from out the waves, It was not as the voice of men: âAll they that lie in loathÃ¨d graves, They shall arise and live again; âAnd whether urns with precious mold, Or whether acts long since forgot, A new shall come of every old, There is no death in any lot.â I could have turned as adders turn To slay themselves in misery, That I had lived my life to learn So late the worth of life to me. O! foolish lips that were content To sup the honey of soft song! O! silly heart so sweetly blent With harp-like music trilled too long! O! heavenly oracle divine That filled my heart with holy flame, What new delight of life is mine? What miracle of hope and aim? A NANTUCKET GRAVE Tired of the tempest and racing wind, Tired of the spouting breaker, Here they come at the end, to find Rest in the silent acre. Feet pass over the graveyard turf, Up from the sea or downward; One way leads to the raging surf, One to the perils townward. âHearken, hearken!â the dead men call,â âWhose is the step that passes? Knows he not we are safe from all, Under the nodding grasses?â UTOPIA Scene: Moku, in the South Sea. The Poet under his vine and fig-tree. Piolani, his âMan Friday,â in attendance.) The Poet speaks: A cottage on a cliff, And a vine beside the door; While the wind, with fragrant whiff, Wakes the parrot in a tiff, Puffs the matting from the floor, Swings the window open wide. âPiolani, please to slide Wine-jar or a calabash Close against the window-sash. Drops a spider from the thatch Down upon my writing table; Splendid specimen to catch, I'll secure him with despatch, Pin him up and write his label. With her song so bland, By the cocoas in the sand, Singing with her siren's voice, The sea leans on the land. I listen and rejoice, For I like this tawny hour; When the stars begin to flower, As it were; and day is pleading, With those heavy drooping lids, And a glance of love exceeding, For one moment more of power. Thrumming crickets, katydids, Clouds of giddy butterflies; Oddest fowls of every feather Hail me with their plaintive cries. Moths and insects of all breeding Upon one another feeding, Huddle here together. âPiolani, take the broom, Chase that lizard from the room. There's another on the wall! How the slimy creatures crawl Over everything and all. After hours of heat, And leagues of burning dust, How soft and passing sweet Is the turf beneath my feet. See this wondrous blossom thrust From its dusky tent of green, In its splendid pride and lust, Like a painted savage queen. âPiolani, do you know Of the nature of this shrub? Why the waters ebb and flow? Where the butterflies all go, Or the future of the grub? You have never thought of these, Yet are happier than I, Who am trying to descry What my brother watcher sees In a very distant sky. Do you ever question fate? Do you hate with burning hate One who cannot think with you? Do you send us white-faced men To a hot perdition, when You have found our faith untrue? That is what we Christians do. Do you pity when you hear How we turn about and dread Being numbered with the dead, And the only God we know Is a God to scorn or fear? Do not tell me that your foe Meets you with unflinching gaze, Certain that the weaker dies! That you let the life-blood flow, For a coward you despise! So your soul through endless days Walks the valley of its youth; Goes the old familiar ways; And shall sleep no more, forsooth! Do not say we cannot touch The one God we fear so much! Do not say we cannot prove The one volume that we love! Do not scorn us when you see How we never can agreeâ How we never have agreed! âKill that scudding centipede In the corner on the floor! Would you land upon our shore And destroy our too frail hopes? Better is the mind that gropes Toward some divine ideal Than the mind that sleeps in sloth! Hopeless, aimless, hating both; Doubting what the years reveal. Let us worship each his way, Though some saints would doubtless say That this very liberal view, And the plan in question, too, Can't, of course, apply to you. Piolani, if you like, Having brought my coffee in, Strip your body to the skin, Don't imagine you will strike Consternation to this breast. Thus it was we found you drest, Nature in this case knew best. Take your little Idol down; Cold and stony, rude and brown, Eyeless, earless, noseless too, But it's all the same to you. Nor foot, nor hand in any part, Utterly devoid of art, But a comfort to your heart. Fall before it as of old, Sing your melis manifold. Burn the boughs of resinous trees, Solemn incantations blending With the savory smoke ascending. Prone upon your hands and knees, Care not that a stranger sees; Be a savage as you please. Be not watchful nor alert, Nor regard with eye suspicious Any matter I assert. Do not try with surreptitious Spell my spirit to convert. Union we can scarce expectâ Let our hearts our ways directâ I will call you some new sect. Piolani, I can hear Your sweet voice rise strong and clear. Is it god or goddess now Whom you flatter with a vow? Under deepest tropic skies Let our two-fold prayer arise. Question not but in the end It will reach the self-same friend, Who will judge us well indeedâ Each according to his meed. Piolani, this is all, Swing the hammock in the hall, Roll your mat out at my feet, Day is weary, night is sweet. Day with toil and trouble teems, Night is hallowÃ©d with dreams. Asleep already, at the start! Piolani, bless your heart! If peace of spirit rest insures What a conscience must be yours. So I swing, and think of this; Saying as I shut my eyes, This is ignorance and bliss. If it isn't, then what is, And who of us is wise? PREMONITION In a still chamber, a white bed of sleep With soothing pillow, and a dream so deep That it alone reality did seem, And all reality was but a dream, I woke as children waken,âin surprise, With soft bewilderment of lips and eyes; For I had felt upon my eyelids pressed One darling baby kiss, upon my breast A passing breath as of an angel-wing Poising above me, fragrant, fluttering. And then I breathed the subtle, sweet perfume Of lilacs,âpurple lilacs in full bloom; Lilacs so cool and fresh, the flowers I knew Just plucked; pale purple lilacs damp with dew. In ecstasy, I to the window flew, Charmed with the garden of my dreams; but no! There coldly fell the moonlight on the snow,â The snow that lay like moonlight far below. Was it a memory that chose to bring From my dream-garden a forgotten flower? Was it a spirit that forestalled the hour, And woke me with the first faint breath of spring? OTAHEITE Beautiful Siren, thou whose palm-plumed crest Gems the horizon like an emerald spray Plucked from perennial paradise away And lost forever, yet forever blest! O Summer Isle! the rich sea's rich bequest Unto her mermen, that with rare display Meltest the souls of those whose hearts are gray, Like the warm wave that fawns upon thy breast! Beautiful Siren! Thy voluptuous vales Invite the weary. As thy raptured guest The mariner lets hang his mildewed sails And seeks the fervor of thy full embrace In bowers whose balm betrays their hiding-place, Never to rouse from his enchanted rest. SOUTH SEA BUBBLES An August in the highlands Is a chilly shadow of my lands; O, for an hour of the fervent heat That nurses the South Sea Islands! Your harvest's a quick comer, Your Fall a tireless hummer; The century-plant grows old and dies, In the prime of a South Sea summer. When smuggling bees hum over Their honey in the clover, I think of the honey beds I know, And storm like a South Sea rover. When the winds begin to mutter, My heart is in a flutter; For I dream of foam and a roaring reef, And a rakish South Sea cutter; In spite of all endeavor, Her straining low lines sever; A crash, a wreck, and a watery graveâ Or a South Sea home forever! I long for a palm thatch cover, Where chattering parrots hover; I hate these dreary fields and folk, And sigh for a South Sea lover. At the glow of sandy reaches, How all my soul beseeches One glimpse of the far-off blue, blue wave That laps on the South Sea beaches! For my heart is full of trouble, Of cares on cares that double; And out of the core of a citron gourd I blow me a South Sea bubble! LINES ON A LOVING CUP My heart to thy heart, My lips to thine, In the dew of the cornfield The blood of the vine. The last sigh at leaving, The word as we part Is, my lips to thy lips, We two, heart to heart. AVALON When lamp light flickers in the room, And curtains shut away the night, Before me in the shadows loom My tranquil islands of delight. I seem to see their sunny slopes, With valleys, misty-veiled between; Their forests hung with leafy ropes And vines of never fading green. I scent the breath of cassia buds, The gloria-mundi as it swings; I see the parrot where it floods The heavy air on flaming wings. O placid rivers of the south, Through still ravines you never haste! With little fear of dearth or drouth Your amber wealth runs all to waste. I cleave again your tideless wave: New Edens dawn at every turn, Where I am greeted by the grave Flamingo and the stately hern. A slim canoe with spicy freight, Steals by me on its silent way; The pale-pink lilies undulate In ecstasy, with life's sweet day. The magic of the gods is mine; For in the bee's hum I may hear A secret that I will divine, And legends of the flowery year. Soft summer showers sweep through the land, The buds are drunk with sun and dew, The twilight falls on either handâ Lo! Night is coming, calm and blue. Along the reef the sea is loud, And tosses in its deep unrest; A mellow star sits in a cloud; The moon is falling to the west. And voices call me in the airâ The dear sad voices that I knowâ âO, come away, while life is fair: Come now!â they cryâand I would go, While life is fair and youth is gay. O, how these tedious fetters thrall! âO come away! O come away!â I hear those plaintive voices call. How little I the cost would heed, If I could rush upon the sea, And hurry on, with tempest speed, To those sad voices calling me. SAIL HO! I heard a rustle in my garden patchâ I saw a shadow bow beneath my thatchâ One morning while the dawn was breaking fast; And, coming near, a nervous hand was passed Across my face, and some one bade me wake, And âhasten to the cliff, for Heaven's sake: A sail was shining in the eastern sea!â âA sail!â I gasped; âthe Saints compassion me. Go you and fire the signal-pyre!â I said. The shadow turned, and in a moment fled; And soon I followedâpale, and scant of breathâ For on that chance was staked my life or death. I skirted the long shore of the lagoon, Shining and moistâshaped like a crescent moonâ And scaled the rocky battlements that rise, Like a great wall, against the eastern skies. The morning air blew down a fragrant whiff, Combing the wind-burnt grasses on the cliff. The cactus' thousand thorny palms were spread Against a sun-cloud hanging, hot and red, In the horizon; and a little way Off, in the bright, blue depths of dawning day, A fair and flickering atomâstar-like, paleâ I saw a sole and solitary sail. Then down I knelt and prayed. The biting fire Curled the green balsams of my signal-pyre, And sent a bold black shaft into the air, That towered above the shadows and grew fair, Like to a palm in stature, full of grace, Waving its sable plumes before the face Of all the world; and, as it would appear, Commanding that the voyager should draw near. I shut away the sight in deep suspense, Half drugged with the rich odors of the dense And multiplying fumes that hung about, And half afraid to struggle with my doubt. The sun arose and all the world was gay; The sweet winds spirited the mists away, I lifted up my eyes, where I was bowed, And, through the portals of a golden cloud, Beheld the vessel, by fair breezes fanned, Trimming her sails, and making for the land. But when she shaped her course toward the shore, And I was sure my banishment was o'er, Somehow I was not happyâfor I grew So jealous of the solitude I knew, And loved my Island dearer than before! MERCY In his last hour a good man lay alone, His couch, the naked earth; his pillow, stone. Thus faithless fortune left him, in the end, To perish in the dark, without one friend. Lifting his eyes, in great bewilderment, He saw seven shining angels o'er him bent; And with his failing breath he cried, in fear, âYe heavenly messengers! what do you here?â Each angel in his turn made low reply, In voices of celestial melody: âI was hungered, and thou gavest meat,â âI was athirst, thy draught was passing sweet.â âAnd I was naked, and was clothed by thee;â âA captive I, when thou didst ransom me;â âI harborless till I thy harbor found;â âWhen I was sick thy mercy knew no bound;â Then the last whispered, as he bowed his head, âAnd thou didst bury me when I was dead.â Now a great glory filled the vault of night, A still small voice glowed like intensest light; It seemed to fashion words that were as flame, One flashed and faded as another cameâ âAnd lo! as thou hast done it unto these, So hast thou done it unto Me.â At ease On his cold bed the good man breathed his last; A bed of roses now, and every blast Was softer, sweeter than an infant's breath, For the bright watchers by that bed of death, And as the spirit left its form of clay, Seven angels bore it in their arms away. INDIANA âWhat's in a name?â the poet cried: Sometimes less than is implied; Sometimes allâand more beside. Tell me, Indiana, why Thy name, so like a lullaby Droned in wigwam to papoose, Seemeth unto me a truce? Is it that the soothing wordâ Musical as song of birdâ Seeks to make in melody What we should not know or see? Face of nature, solemn, proud, Wrapped in blanket of the cloud. Fallow-field and tangled meadâ Arrow-heads their barren seed. Swamp in ambush; stealthy creek Stealing through the meadow sleek. Crafty snake that wimples by; Lake that sleeps with open eye; Sandy soil the foot sinks in Noiselessly as moccasin. Ushered by a frown or smile Stalk the seasons Indian file; Forest flowers of love and spring; Young brave, happily summering, Turns and beckons all too soon Pale face of the harvest moon; Secretly, 'twixt dark and dawn, Indian-like, is summer gone; Blood upon the trail is met In the sullen, red sunset. Shivering trees their mantles lose; Curling leaves, like weird canoes, Driving here and driving there Sail the currents of the air. Fade the embers of life's fire; Fails the fountain of desire; Enter fever, famine, drought; Melancholy prowls about. Drip the night dews, chilly damp, In the now deserted camp; Wampum of the withered cone Hangs in pine-tree lodge alone. Through the branches, savage, fleet, Tear the tomahawks of sleet; And the frantic bows now toss. Come rebellious brotherhoodâ War-paint of the autumnal wood, War-whoop of the wintry wind, War-dance of the snows that blind, Swell the bitter, wild, intense Pow-wow of the elements! These, thy phases, treacherous climeâ Save in Indian-summer time When warm hazy days abound; And the poet seeks in rhyme Peace-pipe and happy hunting ground. THE SECRET WELL I know a well so deep and cool And hid, the crystal-hearted pool Hath never thrilled a swallow's throat Or sweetened one lark's note. No fainting stag, though perishing, Hath ventured to disturb this spring: No leopard with its fiery breast This fountain dares molest. No cunning, silver-casÃ©d trout The sheltered source can e'er find outâ No tongue but mine may ever tell The secret of this well. I build about its guarded rim With added stones; I know the dim, Still twilight of its mossy cell Where the sweet waters dwell. For spirits go between us two With flasks; they brim with softest dew. I drink and am refreshed, and seem As living in a dream. This well, that is alone for me, Is but a fount of memory: And every year that I have known Is but an added stone. My willing thoughts, as spirits, haste To draw the draught I love to taste. There is an ever full supply, Yet who may drink but I? RESURGAM Shall I behold, what time the snows distill In the soft wind along these silver boughs, Crisp bud and curling leafâthe golden house Of robin red-breast and the whip-poor-will? Shall I behold the sudden pulse, the thrill, As the rich blood, long dormant, 'gins to rouse Among the meadows where the cattle browse, Sad-eyed and tranquil, while they take their fill? Shall I behold again, shall I behold The slumbering dead that waken as of old At sound of a still voice that quickeneth? There will I hymn thee to the very skies, Spirit of lovely Spring! I will ariseâ I will arise from out this shadow of death. IN CLOVER O Sun! be very slow to set; Sweet blossoms kiss me on the mouth; O birds! you seem a chain of jet Blown over from the South. O cloud! press onward to the hill; He needs you for his failing streams. The Sun shall be my solace still, And feed me with his beams. O little hump-back bumble-bee! O smuggler! breaking my repose; I'll slily watch you now and see Where all the honey grows. Yes, here is room enough for two; I'd sooner be your friend than not; Forgetful of the world, as true, I would it were forgot. LITANY OF THE SHRINES The Angelus from rise to set of sun Recalls us thrice unto our private prayers; So may these Missions memories recallâ With their soft names, now named one after oneâ Recall the pious life which once was theirs; Recall their rise, alas! recall their fallâ For all too soon their blessÃ©d work was done. In the far south the sunny San Diego, Carmelo, San Antonio, each their way goâ Dust unto dust, so crumbles the abode. Within one year sprang up San Luis Obispo, And San Antonio, and San Gabriel: After five years of struggle, San Francisco, And San Juan Capistranoâit is well To pause a little now and then if, so be, Thou gainest strength; good works rush not pell-mell. Santa Clara and San Buenaventura, Santa Barbara and Purissima; And darling Santa Cruzâsanctissimaâ Next Soledad, and then a pause secura. Six years to gather strength, when San JosÃ© And San Miguel and shortly San Fernando Were born within a twelve-month; what can man do Better than this? And then San Luis Rey Closed a long interval of years elevenâ Friars and neophytes were going to heaven At such a rate!âbut the good work progressed: San Juan Bautista closed a century blest. Santa Inez and fair San Rafael Lead to the final effort in Solano;â 'Twas thus the missions rose and thus they fellâ Perchance a solitary boy-soprano, Last of his race, was left the tale to tell. Ring, gentle Angelus! ring in my dream, But wake me not, for I would rather seem To live the life they lived who've slumbered long Beneath their fallen altars, than to waken And find their sanctuaries thus forsaken: God grant their memory may survive in song! STIGMATA In the wrath of the lips that assail us, In the scorn of the lips that are dumb, The symbols of sorrow avail us, The joy of the people is come. They parted Thy garments for barter, They follow Thy steps with complaint; Let them know that the pyre of the martyr But purges the blood of the saint! They have crucified Thee for a token; For a token Thy flesh crucified Shall bleed in a heart that is broken For love of the wound in Thy side: In pity for palms that were pleading, For feet that were grievously used, There is blood on the brow that is bleeding And torn, as Thy brow that was bruised! By Thee have we life, breath, and being; Thou hast knowledge of us and our kind; Thou hast pleasure of eyes that are seeing, And sorrow of eyes that are blind; By the seal of the mystery shown usâ The wound that with Thy wounds accordâ O Lord, have mercy upon us! Have mercy upon us, O Lord! SUNSET FROM PUU MAHOE I thread the path through verdant leas, Till, looking downward from the height, Lo! dreamy lands by dreamy seas Made misty in the mellow light. And ever-wandering clouds that drape With tint of pearl, or stain of blood, The nestling isle, the distant cape That sinks into yon purple flood. And overhead the jewelled plain, Where shadows deepen as they closeâ But deepening, neither blot nor stain The sweetest blue that heaven knows. O perfect sightâmore perfect still For being sought in happy moodâ How many hearts might pulse and thrill Within this seeming solitude! And have the ages wrought so long; Must all this beauty go to make A thought to perish in a song, One picture for one creature's sake? No! rather think this fair expanse May be the margin of that shore Swept over with seraphic glance By spirits that we know no more. SANCTUARY Surely some sacrilegious hand Hath robbed the temples of their store Of relics, up and down the land, And hurled the altars o'er. And strewn the treasures all among These quiet valleys. As I walk I find a pearly rosary hung Upon this lily stalk. Hath timid maid, or tearful nun Bethought her of this lone retreat Yet, with her âAveâ scarce begun, Her prayer-beads at her feet, Intruders bid her quickly fly, And flying, frighted, she forgets That where she knelt in secret lie Her glittering amulets. Alas! how poor, how desolate The place where man strode rudely by, The pink no more shall elevate Its chalice to the sky. And here are bleeding roses shorn Along the hedgeâby shearer vext, Rare antique rubricsâroughly torn From that quaint leafy text. And thistle-aspergills bestrew Meek buds that nestle at their side With holy drops of luscious dew That night hath sanctified. The morning-glory's fragile cup A lucent honey-drop could boast; Fair monstranceâit is broken up, And veilÃ©d is the Host. And what is this that greeteth me, The Calla, that I prize above All lilies? so I mention thee, O! lily of my loveâ A perfumed satin altar cloth With one tall, golden candlestick; A velvet butterfly's the moth That frets thy rosy wick. Thy spotless napkin doth enfold Such balm and costly frankincense, As shrouds the swinging censer's gold In clouds that struggle thence. But now I hear the vesper call Of floating air-bells, deftly tipt; The dove's at her confessionalâ The monk-mole in his crypt. And flowery fields my eyes engage; The rivulets, the winding waysâ A missal, whose illumined page Is given up to praise. So if none false hath donned the gown And sought the votive priest to play, Then thrown the sacred altars down And hid the charms awayâ Dear Nature is the saint that rears This sanctuary to our Godâ And still renews through all the years Where hateful feet have trod. VALE He had the soul of truth, Strong with the strength of youth; He had the gift of wit, With love to sweeten it. He knew not fear or shame: When the destroyer came, When death betrayed the fall, He could surrender all, Putting the world aside. For time had proved him, And the gods loved him That he died. IN A CLOISTER A fair white tower, where doves as white as snow Flutter, the while three bells swing to and fro; A garden and a cloister hid below. A summer garden full of calm delight; A cloister wreathed with roses, red and white: A row of lilies meek, that hold their breath, As pale and mute and passionless as death: Curtained beyond a leafy screen, the bees Drone their monotonous, sweet Litanies: A fountain lisping the responses, caught On the still airs, with heavy incense fraught: And all within an Island in the wild And wide Lagoon; an Island Sanctified; Walled by the golden flood, the glowing amber tide. THE STORMY PETREL Above the rough sea's climbing crest The sunbeams flashed afar, And smote the Phaeton's silver breast, That sparkled like a star. A wail was in the rising gale, A wail both long and low; The sailors flew to shorten sail, The landsmen crept below. We faced the fury of the blast; A head-sea swept the deckâ A great wave leaped upon the mast, And threatened total wreck. No man but with the spray was blindâ No galley fires would burnâ No sound but of the awful wind That shrieked from stem to stern. Yet with a quick and fearful glance That now my bosom thrills, I saw the stormy petrel dance Among the watery hills. And where the hissing bubbles sprawled With weird and impish form, The dancing petrel clucked and called The devils of the storm. A RHYME OF THE OLD YEAR Who killed the Old Year? âI,â said Sparrow Time; âSo put me in the rhymeâ I killed the Old Year.â Who saw him die? âI,â said the Morning Star; âWhile watching from afar, I saw him die.â Who caught his blood? âI,â said each Man and Maid; âI caught a drop that will not fade, For it is his blood.â Who'll weave his shroud? âI,â said Memory; âOf flowers fair to see I'll weave his shroud.â Who'll dig his grave? âI,â said Oblivion; âFor, sure, it must be doneâ I'll dig his grave.â Who'll be chief mourner? âI,â said Sad Regret; âAs I am fittest yet, I'll be chief mourner.â Who'll come and sing? âWe,â said Hope and Trust; âWe'll sing above his dustâ We'll come and sing.â Who'll toll the bell? âI,â said the Broken Heart; âI can tollâit asks no art; I'll toll the bell.â And so the service Is sung and said Over the pitiful Year that is dead. RETURN Out of the sunset, in a Summer land, Led by the South wind from a coral strand, A prodigal I come at Christmas Eve, Love in my heart and heart upon my sleeve. 'Tis here I seek the love of long ago And find it, radiant as an afterglow. Have I been absent, sayâor can it be That I have dreamed that life beyond the sea? I cannot tell you, for so true you seem, Which is reality and which is dream: But if I dream to-night I pray you then, âOh, do not wake meâlet me dream again.â OLD MONTEREY Sleep on in thy sunny sand-dunes and slumber in thy byways; In the hollow of thy drowsy hills, lo! sleep and the shadow of death. Dream on, O dear enchantress, of the babel that filled thy highways, When passionate throngs sang thy song of songs and a war-cry was thy breath. Now in thy listless languor, lo! the encircling sea-mewâ Gulls in the wild sea-gardens; and the curve of the lateen sail As it cleaves like a silver scimitar the mist of the sea; and dream you Of the treasure vast and the glory pastâthe visions of no avail. Dream of the splendid trappings of the troops that met and mingledâ Mexican cavaleros and hidalgos of old Castile: Hark to the music of the spurs of silver that jolted and jingled; And loudly laugh, as the wine you quaff, at the past beyond appeal. Where are they now, O dreamer? thy treasures have vanished whither? Thou who wast first to the headland-front and Queen of the western sea: Long have I watched and have waited and have wandered hither and thither Asking a word with a voice unheard and now I would ask it of thee. The bitter tang of the sea is ours and the winds forever roaming; The fleecy crest of the breaking wave and the ribbons of streaming kelp; The fishers mending their nets in the sun, and the crickets in the gloaming, And the seal's gruff bark, in the dew and the dark, and the whine of her hungry whelp. The wind and the wave pour over the rocks that are barren and bony; Like ghosts of avalanches the fog sweeps down from the heights: The star-fish sprawl in the briny meadows; the abalone Hides, where it lies, its rainbow dyes in a dome of dim delights. There is spice of the pine in plenty and oak and the cypress tangle; And the bleaching bones of the strand whale, and sea-shells near and farâ No soft refrain of old, old Spain, or voices in musical wrangle; Nor the click of the clashing castanets nor the throb of the hushed guitar. There is never a day in the year but tells of thy glory gone forever, And never a dusk that hovers near in the sea-shell pink of the sky, But we sit in the chill adobe shade with hearts that are past endeavorâ While the mists unfurl like the gates of pearl, as we watch the daylight die. YO-SEMITE FALLS O, under Heaven! is there one More lovely offspring of the snow, So cherished by the constant Sun, So fostered by the gale below? In what far angel-haunted spring Hast thou, fair stream, thy happy birth? What is thy will that thou shouldst fling Thy slender form from Heaven to earth? The cloud thy sister is, the rain Thy brother; and thy form inclined Most spirit like, has often lain Within the broad arms of the wind. Thy trailing silver laces sway Upon the air how constantly!â Thy misty tissue lifts away A swinging ladder to the sky. Forever falling, and to fall Forever from that cloudy gate, And crying with incessant call Against the tumult of thy fate. The valley takes thee, trembling stream, In smoky fragments on its breast; Wake, giddy leaper, from thy dream. Here is at last some peaceful rest. AT POINT LOBOS Clear noon without obscurity, No flake of cloud 'twixt heaven and me; No mist athwart the Golden Gate: The hearty sun doth willfully His profuse beams precipitate. I cling to humpÃ©d rocks that kneel On unswept sands, where breakers reel In splendid curves, and pile their foam In spongy hills, that slow congeal, And dulce and drift-wood find a home. We clasp the silver crescent set Within the hazy parapet That belts the horizon: and in glee I count the fitful puffs that fret The eternal levels of the sea. I watch the waves that seem to breathe And pant unceasingly beneath Their silken coverings, that cringe, As flecked with swirls of froth, they seethe, And whip, and flutter to a fringe. Brown pipers run upon the sand Like shadows; far out from the land Gray gulls slide up against the blue; One shining spar is sudden manned By squadrons of their wrecking crew. My city is beyond the hill; I cannot hear its voices shrill: I little heed its gains and greeds; Here is my song, where waters spill Their liquid strophes in the reeds. And to this music I forswear Whatever soils the world with care: I see the listless waters tossâ I track the swift lark through the airâ I lie with sunlight on the moss. White caravans of cloud go by Across the desert of bright sky, And burly winds are following The trailing pilgrims, as they fly Over the grassy hills of spring. What Mecca are they hastening to? What princess journeying to woo In the rich Orient? I am thrilled With spice and odor they imbueâ I feed upon their manna spilled! I strip my breast with eager mind, To tarry and invite the wind To my embrace: by curious spell It quickens me with praises kindâ 'Tis Ariel that blows his shell! Invisible, and soft as dews Descending, he his love renews, Delighting daisy colonies That gloss them with the lustrous ooze Of meadows steeped in ecstasies. Until the homely, sunburnt Heads, The tumbling hills, in browns and reds, And gray sand-hillocks, everywhere Are buried in the mist that sheds Its subtle snow upon the air. And Prospero, aroused from sleep, Recalls his spirits from the deepâ They cross the wave with stealthy tread, Their shadows down upon me sweepâ And day is past, and joy is fled. I hear the dismal bells that shout Their warning to the ships without: The dripping sails are reefed and furled, The pilots sound and grope aboutâ The Gate is barred against the world! THE ANGELUS At dawn, the joyful choir of bells In consecrated citadels, Flings on the sweet and drowsy air, A brief, melodious call to prayer; For Mary, Virgin meek and lowly, ConceivÃ©d of the Spirit Holy, As the Lord's angel did declare. Ave Maria! At noon, above the fretful street, Our souls are lifted to repeat The prayer, with low and wistful voiceâ âAccording to Thy word, and choice, Though sorrowful and heavy laden, So be it to Thy handmaiden!â Then all the sacred bells rejoiceâ Ave Maria! At eve, with roses in the west, The daylight's withering bequest, Ring, prayerful bells, while blossom bright The stars, the lilies of the night; Of all the songs the years have sung us, âThe Word made flesh has dwelt among us,â Is still our ever new delight. Ave Maria! LAHAINA Where the wave tumbles; Where the reef rumbles; Where the sea sweeps Under bending palm-branches, Sliding its snow-white And swift avalanches: Where the sails pass O'er an ocean of glass. Or trail their dull anchors Down in the sea-grass. Where the hills smoulder; Where the plains smoke; Where the peaks shoulder The clouds like a yoke; Where the dear isle Has a charm to beguile As she lies in the lap Of the seas that enfold her. Where shadows falter; Where the mist hovers Like steam that covers Some ancient altar. Where the sky rests On deep wooded crests; Where the clouds lag; Where the sun floats His glittering motes Swimming the rainbows That girdle the crag. Where the newcomer In deathless summer Dreams away troubles; Where the grape blossoms And blows its sweet bubbles; Where the goats cry From the hillside corral; Where the fish leap In the weedy canalâ In the hollow lagoon With its waters forsaken; Where the dawn struggles With night for an hour, Then breaks like a tropical Bird from its bower. Where from the long leaves The fresh dew is shaken; Where the wind sleeps And where the birds waken. TO A SON OF THE SOIL Without the man with the seed Who would do the sowing? Without the man with the hoe Who would do the hoeing? Without the man with the scythe Who would do the mowing? God is the God of us allâ Blessings well bestowing. Son of the son of the soilâ Earth our fost'ring mother,â Without the rich and the poor Who would help the other? Without the call to do good Each one to another, Sad were the world. Here's a hand, Brother,âO my brother! THE FIRST RAIN Between the ranks of thistle, down the road, The phantom flocks of sunbeams hastily, With gilded feathers of the butterfly, Disperse away; anon a weary load Of grain, wild scented, being freshly mowed, Comes smoking on; as from the brooding sky There fall deliberate, still showers of shy Big rain-drops all around. The teamsters goad The swaying oxen, steaming, to a shed For covering. The brown and dusty trees Are whispering, as eagerly they spread Their branches in the rain, and stand at ease, And listen, yonder in the clover bed The happy buzzing of ten thousand bees! WIND AND WAVE O when I hear at sea The water on our lee, I fancy that I hear the wind That combs my hemlock tree: But when beneath that tree I listen eagerly, I seem to hear the rushing wave I heard far out at sea. MAIDEN LOVE Love, maiden Love, cries not within the gates Where sit the watchers, watching hour by hour; Love hideth by the wayside and Love waits Breathless within her bower. For faint her voice and very sweet to hear, And dim her form, yet very fair to see, O Love! my Love! it quiets all my fear And hourly comforts me. Who blindly loves, and boldly, he but errs; Love answers not to each and all who cry; Perchance this Love her willing love prefers To those who pass her by. They know not where to seek her and to find; They wander after her from night till morn; Their messages are wasted on the wind And all in all forlorn. Yet who shall lead the lover to his Love, Or lead his Love to him, to ease his sigh? No one I wot of out of Heaven aboveâ In sooth, not you, or I! SAMARITANS I heard a tender voice, as one That cried from out the wilderness, âCome hitherward, our longing son, The woods thy heart shall bless.â I took in hand my trusty staff, And sailed across the narrow sea; I of the running brooks could quaff, The land would nourish me. I said: âMine host can well afford, His cup is sweetened to the brim. Now, whoso asks me to his board I will partake with him.â All day I watched the country road, All day my hopeful heart was kind; But no man said where he abode I would a welcome find. All day I sought a friend, all day My soul was fruitless in the search; Men passed in silence on their way, And left me in the lurch. They passed me on the other side, I shivered in the clouding dusks. At last I cried, âMust I abide In hunger with the husks?â A fir tree spread her matted eaves, The moss grew soft beneath my head, The wind swept over me the leaves, And furnished all my bed. Some robins called me at the dawn In matin time: we said our prayers; Then seeing all my breakfast gone They gave me some of theirs. They showed me where the berries grew, They found me a delicious spring; We drank a jolly toast or two, And laughed like anything. We talked about the city folk Across our berries and our drink: âThey can't see heaven for the smoke,â Said Master Bob o' Link. We laughed all day in huge delight, And sang and gossiped unafraid; When lo! at coming of the night My bed was still unmade. I said, âI'd better turn about,â But they opposed me in a breath. I didn't like that sleeping out, Lest I should catch my death. They begged me to remain awhile, And proffered nests; but they were small. With songs they strove me to beguile Without a bed at all. Then berries are so plain a dish, And water tasteless on the whole, And still there was the endless wish That haunts my restless soul. I said: âSweet-voiced and wingÃ©d friends, You build your homes within my heart; But distanceâsometimesâsomething lendsâ One glass before we part!â We drank a toast at parting there; âA speech,â they cried, with one accord. Oh, there was music in the air Till order was restored! They followed to the city boat, Then in a body gave me cheers; I drank the sweetness of each note Into my thirsting ears. I made a speech of compliment: If country life should prove a bore, âMy room is yours quite free of rent, I'll feed you at the door. âYou will not find our city streets So soft and sweet a place of rest; Not every friendly face one meets Has love within the breast. âYou are the friends I find most true, For you were kind when no one bid. In trusting you I only do As old Elijah did.â IN CONFERENCE If I could fly the hateful town, And flying, suddenly discover Some velvet valley, softly brown, With hills that elbow one anotherâ Those robust hills; so resolute And satisfied, with brawny shoulders Set close together, in their mute, Firm way, that startles us beholders, And gathered close about my vale, To nurse it, sitting still together, Its body-guard in autumn mail, Like Arabs in their cloaks of leather, I would dispose myself among Their surging waves of grain, beseeching Some brief translation of their tongue, Some knowledge of their healthful preaching. Oh! pleasure for a spirit vext, A listening, after introduction, To whispered echoes of their text, And volumes of their pure instruction; While ever from the valley's rim The wind peeps over as it passes, And merrily and mild for him, Blows silver clouds across the grasses; Brings down an apple with his hailâ Plump skinâwas ever apple riper? And frights, in hasty whirr, a quail That was my musical chief piper. Full-bosomed quail in mottled casque And plume, and silken bib to cover Your panting throat, I only ask, Return again unto your lover! Now swoops an inky cloud of birds Into the valley's deepest dimple; They storm me with their teasing words, Yet please me with their gambols simple. I wish those five in epaulets Of rose would quell the boisterous greeting; But I suppose each one forgets He interrupts my quiet meeting. Their little hearts with song-delight Are over-fullâsufficient reason; The pretty things are pardoned quite For only singing out of season. Was that a sprinkle on my face, Descending from this sky of blueness? Baptism in this holy place Is fitting; for a sense of newness Pervades these vestibules of earthâ Sacristies, most securely hiddenâ These halls, appropriate to new birth, Where all unto the feast are bidden. How silent has the valley grownâ The birds have hushed their playful riot; A murmur, as a bee's dull drone, Is all that stirs the perfect quiet. Transparent curtains of the rain Are sweeping down to me, delighting The dusty trees; where I have lain The broken grasses now are righting. The swarms of blackbirds lift away; The most demoralized of creatures Myself will be, if I delayâ So now, farewell, my wholesome preachers! With your broad foreheads in the mist, You cannot show a sign of sorrow; But you are honest, keep the trystâ I'll worship with you on to-morrow. BY THE BROOK Down across the hill's low browâ A slender, silver filletâ Nothing is so musical As my little rillet. Ah! that laughing song of yours! Delicately trill it. Shall I fret you, hasty brook? Shall I mar your pacesâ Weaver, weaving silver threads Into silver laces, Round about and in and out The sunniest of places? Loose your tresses in the chase, Slip about the border Of yon garden wall, and catch A blossom, gay marauder! What shall please my love of ease As your sweet disorder? While the world goes jogging on, Presently I miss you; Life is made of other stuff Than your limpid tissue. Turn a mill, you lazy rill, While I wait the issue. Let the beetle while away The Summer with its drumming, Foam you at the whirling wheel, And babble to its humming. Toil away the livelong dayâ It is more becoming. Creep beneath the sweeping bough, While each ripple twinkles, Starlike, in a sky of leaves, And your frothy crinkles Form a leathern apron there, Full of creamy wrinkles. When the bald and brazen day Hath donned his dusky visor, Still you flow a-down apace, While night's myriad eyes are Watching you; for what they view No one is the wiser. THROUGH THE SHADOWS All in a dream in the twilight, Glimmering stars in their glee, List to the murmur of far-off Ripples of tropic sea. Low in the westward bleeding The sun slowly sinks in the waveâ Staining and tinting with crimson The corals that fashion his grave. Out through the mist and the vapor, The cloudy wreaths and the rings, Sunlight has flown like a butterfly Brushing the gold from its wings. Quiet is coming and folding Our troubles away; and our woes Are hushed in the cool, fragrant shadows, Like bees in the heart of a rose. Come on little stars all silver, For the terrible sun has gone, And out of the eastern shadows The moon sets sail for the dawn. Pale are the starsâfor the morning Is blooming fresh as the May; So through the shadows we wander, Seeking the perfect day. YO-SEMITE Innumerable lessons to relate And myriad voices rushing to baptize These chosen lips, which send into the skies Their oracles, to awe and elevate. The world's chief mouth-piece is this marvelous gate, That lavish nature wholly sanctifies With majesty and beauty. Here my eyes Some revelation seem to penetrate; For God, begetting mysteries from the first, All glorified, stood down upon the rock, And smiting through, the curious earth was rivenâ A thousand silver arteries were burstâ The mountains staggered from the fearful shock, With heart laid bare to the soft eyes of Heaven. TAMALPAIS How glorious thy dwelling place! How manifold thy beauties are! I do not reckon time or spaceâ I worship thy exceeding grace, And hasten, as a flying star, To reach thy splendor from afar. The first flush of thy morning face Is dear to me; thy shadowless, Broad noon that doth all sweets confess; But fairer is thy even-fall, When seem to cry with airy call Thy roses in the wilderness. Thy deserts blithely blossoming, Decoy me for the love of Spring. With all thy glare and glitter spent, Thy quiet dusk so eloquent; Thy veil of vaporsâthe caress Of Zephyrus, right cool and sweetâ I cannot wait to love thee lessâ I cling to thee with full content, And fall a-dreaming at thy feet. Anon the sudden evening gun Awakes me to the sinking sun And golden glories at the Gate. The full, strong tides, that slowly run, Their sliding waters modulate To indolent soft winds that wait And lift a long web newly spun. I see the groves of scented bay, And night is in their fragrant mass; But tassel-shadows swing and sway, And spangles flash and fade away Upon their glimmering leaves of glassâ And there a fence of rail, quite gray, With ribs of sunlight in the grassâ And here a branch full well arrayed With struggling beams a moment stayedâ Like panting butterflies afraid. Lo! shadows slipping down the slope And filling every narrow vale, The shining waters growing paleâ The mellow-burning star of Hope And in the wave its silver trope. A slender shallop, feather-frail, A pencil-mast and rocking sail. The glooms that gather at the Gate; The somber lines against the sky, While dizzy gnats about me fly, And overhead the birds go by, Dropping a note so crystal clear, The spirit cannot choose but hear. The hollow moon, and up between An oak with yard-long mosses, green In sunlight, now as dull as crÃªpe; The mountain softened in its shape, Its perfect symmetry attainedâ And swathed in velvet folds, and stained With dusty purple of the grape. DRIFTING A lark's song rippled in the air, With liquid trill that smote the dawn, He hastened down the dewy lawn And found the morning breezes fair; And half the anchor-cable in, And half the sails were loosed, and full Of salty winds; with steady pull He bade the frothing eddies spin And whirl about his dripping oar, As on he sped and joined the bark; Then from the deck he leaned to mark The wondrous beauty of the shore. They seemed as falling scales, his tears, From blinded eyes, that would not see How comfort in that home could be, Though comfort kept him all his years. High on the yard a sailor sang: âO! dusky love beyond the sea; O! dusky love that longs for meââ âAnd thee,â the mocking echoes rang. âThere is a glory in the galeâ An idle dream will suit the calm, And talk of leafy thatch and palmâ Shall fill the watch with song and tale. âLo! yonder is the star that guides The mariner; we lift our hands About the world, in many lands; For what are winds, and what are tides, âBut spirits luring us abroad? Rise fragrant isles before our eyesâ A pyre for passion's sacrifice, Where pleasure is our only god!â A hundred trilling songs of larks A hundred blooming dawns may greet, But who shall stay the wanderer's feet, And call his spirit from the dark? DECREES I sit in sorrow by the watery gates, A-questioning the Fates. I ask: âWhat manner of strange ships are these Slipping adown the seas? âSlipping adown the slanting seasâwhat sail Is yonderâcalm and pale?â Then the Fates answer me: âThat goodly bark Braving the waters dark âSo fearlesslyâthe cross upon her mastâ Is Trust, come home at last. âYon quivering craft that veers and puts about, Is the long-cruising Doubt. âThis dancing galley that the waters mock Shall strike upon the rock; â'Tis Chance, a pleasure yacht; her ribs shall bleach Upon the blistering beach.â Yet still I see a flamelike, shining cloud, And eager cry aloud: âThat other sail that waits upon the windâ What is her name and kind?â To me the Fates: âThough lying still and wan She shall approach anon; âSo nobly mannedâwith any gale to copeâ Behold the trusty Hope.â âQuicken the winds, I pray you, worthy Fates; In her are stored my freights! âNor am I fit for life of any sort, Till she shall reach the port.â MY FRIEND I have a friend who is so true to me, We may not parted be. Though I have strayed, on to the uttermost, Yet is his voice not lost. If I am madly-deaf for having erred, Still may I hear his word. If sin hath slain mine honor, straight appears The river of his tears, Wherein I find redemption; tenderly He woos my fear away And searches out some star of hope, above, So boundless is his love. When from the loathÃ©d grave I shall arise, He'll hail me from the skies. Who else would seek me in corruption's dress With a so kind caress? Though I am weak, there is a hope of power; He is my mighty tower; Like as a flame to fright the gloom away; He is my perfect day. I am the homely bulb that tops the reedâ He is the precious seed. I am the rudest shell the vext-waves whirlâ He is the priceless pearl. Thou art indeed my friend while ages roll, O, thou, my deathless soul! A PROVERB PROVED Will My Love's so trustful eyes Ever fail me, though I please From their depths to draw supplies That could waste the seas? Will those pure delicious springs Ever fail me? Wretched day When my heart no longer brings Its life-draught away! Do they nourish my desire, But to break the golden bowl? At their margin bid expire My all-thirsting soul? No; a voice forever tells That My Love's so trustful eyes Are th' unfathomed crystal wells Where within truth lies. AFTERMATH Out of my life has gone So much that was worth the living I watch with dimmed eyes for the dawn Hoping, despairing, forgiving. Hoping that hope may live, Despairing lest fate us sever, Forgiving whate'er's to forgive, Forever, and ever, and ever. âI AM THE WAY!â I am the way, fear not, but follow me: Not thro' the waters flowing still and sweet; Not thro' the meadows gracious to the feet; But in the bitter dust and heat of day.â I am the way!</field>
