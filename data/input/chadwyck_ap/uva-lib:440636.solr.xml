      <field name="fulltext">?Ridiculum acri Fortius et melius magnes plerumque fecat res. Hor. ODE I. SALUTATORY ODE. Jonathan reneweth his Homage—complaineth of the Desertion of his Printer—laboureth to remove Prejudices against him—displayeth his Knowledge in Natural History, and concludeth with a little Story. Ecce iterum Crispinus! My Masters all! your poet's here again, With heart, and wind and limb, sound as a roach: My humble Ditties if you'll not disdain Thus, cap in hand, once more I will approach. That rogue Freneau The first part of the Probationary Odes was printed in Freneau's Gazette, June 1793. has left me in the lurch, Or, I 'd been with you early in the Winter; Bishops could better do without a Church Than lofty Poets can without a Printer. Yet I 've some little smattering of fear, Your worships, truly, do not like my name; I'm no King-killer, Sirs, I vow and swear, Tho' Cousin Peter may be, to his shame. My Lilliputian arrows scarce could fly So high, as to assault a Monarch's heel: And sure I am, you'll every man deny, That e're a shaft of mine has made you feel. At Quimbus-Hestrin The Lilliputian's name for Gulliver: The epithet of man-mountain, as applied to our modern Atlas, must be confessed to be peculiarly happy.-Atlas should I shoot, Unless I had him stretch'd upon the ground, My blunted arrows from his royal Boot, As from enchanted armour would rebound: Or, could my love so far be turn'd to hate, As to attack our Daddy-Vice, so big, His Brain my shafts could never penetrate, Lost in the bushy bulwark of his Wig Whether the venerable figure here alluded to is so well convinced of the strength of his pericranium as to dispense with that bulwark at present, or whether he is at length so far convinced of the absurdity of singularity, as to relinquish that favorite ornament, it is certain that he has lately laid aside his wig.: The Bird of Wisdom, thus, in Ivy-bush, Securely doth defy the Fowler's Lead, Nor heeds its rattling terrors, all a rush, Which ne'er can reach that Citadel his head. Should I touch Midas, he might touch in turn, Then Jonathan, at once, were stiff in Gold! Such aukward trappings I should wish to spurn; As Putnam, when he lost his dog of old In the war which preceded the revolutionary war, General Putnam was an officer in the army. He was presented with a suit of laced regimentals by the General Assembly of the Province, and having dressed himself in them, on some Gala day, a favorite dog of his was so much affrighted at his metamorphosis, that he clapped his tail between his legs, and ran off yelping, and never after was seen by his master, who protested he would not have given his dog for a dozen suits of laced clothes.. Sagacious dog! of democratic breed; As Argus The name of Ulysses's faithful dog. faithful, and as Argus bold! Who ne'er deserted in the hour of need, But sled in terror from a coat of gold. Or should I look at Minos, Judge of Shades! His awful brow contracted to a frown, The very thought of which my soul pervades, Might, like the Gorgon, turn me into stone. That huge purse-bellied-crocodile See Ode V. Part I. The Bank seems to be very aptly compared to that animal. C. C., whose weam Affords its nurslings such a charming shelter, Whither, if they but hear a Raven scream, They run, like little 'possums, helter-skelter; With pretty little Wrens, that pick his teeth Of many a sav'ry morsel between whiles; And chirp and flutter all his snout beneath, To warn of him of that damn'd Ichneumon Some writers on natural history mention that the crocodile admit the wren to this kind of familiarity, and that the bird in return gives him warning on the approach of the ichneumon, his natural and only formidable enemy, who attacks him by scratching out his eyes: others say he destroys his eggs. G ? s; Arm'd as he is, with plated Coat of Mail, Harder than Elephant's or Rhinoceros' hide, 'Gainst which the Dart of Cephalus would fail, Or e'en the Shafts of Phœbus glance aside, May rest secure, 'till that dread period comes When G ? s; shall rear his fatal Battle-Ax: Till then, his Wrens may feast upon his Gums, Nor for a moment from their meal relax Jonathan here seems to allude to advantages which the favourites of the Bank derive from that institution; a circumstance which may well account for the alarm spread by them whenever that Holy of Holies is supposed to be in danger of an inquiry. C. C.. My spear-grass arrows cannot hurt him, then, Were I to shoot them down his very throat; And even should they hit a little Wren, He'd turn and peck at me again, no doubt. Then look not, Sirs, with a suspicious eye Upon your Bard when he appears before ye; Suppose that for a moment I should try To entertain you with a little Story. THE MAGPIES—A TALE. A pair of Magpies once a visit made To Court, and hopp'd familiarly about, From Room to Room; still running in and out, And peeping in each corner, whilst they staid. One luckless day they found a door a-jar, Where, in deep council and profound debate, Sat all the feather'd great heads of the State T' avert the prospect of approaching War; The Cock had by the Lion been assaulted, And ev'ry Savage beast had gather'd round To get poor Chanticleer upon the ground, Who still upon the house-top crow'd and vaulted. A Bat Perisuus—alias Camillus who late had herded with the mice, And in his heart the Quadrupeds prefer'd, Though he profess'd to call himself a Bird, To starve the Cock at once gave his advice. The Magpies caught his words, and out they slew, Not understanding more than half the matter, About poor Chanticleer began to chatter, And swore he would be starv'd outright, they knew. The wond'ring Cock was struck with vast surprise: A Bird for wisdom fam'd was heard to say, Nor Bats nor Chatterers The chatterer is the general name given by naturalists to the whole class of Jay-birds. our nation sway, The feather'd tribe are all the Cook's allies Alas! poor Jonathan! how horridly hast thou been mistaken! The event hath proved that Bats and Chatterers are of more consequence than the whole nation put together. C. C.. ODE II. TO A REGENERATED BODY This Ode appears to have been addressed to the last, and not the present regenerated Body.—The advise may not be amiss for the latter, since it proved too late for the former; and perhaps would have been disregarded had it been earlier. C. C.. Jonathan displayeth his Skill in the Therapeutic Art, and his acquaintance with the Doctors of the Soborne—warneth of contagious diseases, and concludeth with a new Case in Nosology. I've heard that some Physicians recommend, To help a vitiated Constitution, Some pounds of blood, per vene sect: sumend In plain English, bleeding—Jonathan hath here borrowed a little medical Latinity.: And with a Pig's, or Calf's make restitution. Nothing is easier than the operation, Fait par le moyen d'une petite Canulle For a more copious account of the manner of performing this operation, the reader is respectfully referred to the first volume of Tristram Shandy, page 129, &amp;c.; The patient's health by this sophistication Returning, when his veins are syring'd full. But if, perchance, the ancient Taint remains, Ere while it will corrupt the borrow'd mass, Of wholesome blood from Swine's salubrious veins, And fresh disease and torment bring to pass. In other Bodies, thus, tho' sometimes drain'd Of putrid humours which destroy their health, Whilst in exchange much purer blood is gain'd, Some subtle poison often lurks by stealth. Full sure I am, that no such Taint remains, To poison your regenerate Corporation: Some wholesome blood of Swine now fills its veins, Avoid! I pray you, Sirs, Inoculation! Some Operators of such skill you'l meet, They will inoculate you without pain, Your senses like a cozening Harlot cheat, And whilst they fondle fix an odious Stain. The very smell of some Diseases taints: Small-pox, Assumption, Bank-script, Foreign Loans, And Yellow-fever might infect e'en Saints, And like a Leprosy corrode their bones. Fly all infirmaries where these ills prevail; Bush-Hill was not so dang'rous in September; One yellow-fever with the frost may fail; One more contagious rages in December: A new Disease, which leaves a fouler stain, Contagion threatens with resistless Rage, Pollutes the Lips, the Tongue, the Heart, the Brain, The Anglo-Mania nam'd by Doctors sage. A Galli-Phobia first the Taint betrays: The patient trembles if Ca Ira 's heard; Discrimination bloodless leaves his Face, Though Friends to Enemies should be prefer'd A servile, coward cringing, next succeeds, Base as a Courtier's, or as Spaniel's whipt: Henceforth the wretch on British Ordure feeds, To Guineas minted, or wrap'd up in Script This truly formidable Disease has made such progress of late, that one may be in as little danger of the plague in Grand Cairo, as of this contagion in some parts of the United States. C. C.. ODE III. TO THE SAME. Jonathan correcteth a general Error.—Propagateth a new Gospel-Salvation.—Warneth of false prophets; and concludeth with a modern Athanasian Creed, for the Benefit of good Believers. Utilium tardus provisor, prodigus æris, Sublimis, cupidæsque, et amata relinquere pernix. Hor. Fame is a Lyar, and Reports of old, Were held to be of her vile fabrication: A dif'rent Story in our days is told: Reports the Gospel are of our Salvation. “Believe ME and be sav'd, saith the Reporter, “Nor seek my sacred myst'ries to unravel.” The Presbyterian Catechism Shorter Contains not more young Cloddy-poles to gravel. Ask ye why Laws, and Constitution too, In vain prescribe modes of appropriation? Have Laws or Constitution ought to do, To change the course of HIS Predestination It will be remembered that the late Secretary of the Treasury, in his Letter to his agent in Holland, written the very day that he received those instructions which he thought proper to disregard, speaks of his own destination of the money, which he was instructed to borrow for a different purpose.! Say, were not these first pre-ordain'd by HIM Jonathan is mistaken in supposing the present Constitution the fabric of his hands. A constitution of King, Lords, and Commons was contemplated by our modern Machievel, and it will not be his fault if he does not yet succeed in such an establishment, with himself at the head of it. C. C. 'Tis sitting then his will should both control, And if perchance thro' blunder, or thro' whim, They err, his will must rectify the whole. Stick then, I pray you, Sirs, to the Report; Regard its Dictates more than sacred writ; To Law, or Constitution why resort! Stretch it, or tear it, if it will not fit. But when Reports from other quarters come, Such may be deem'd Apocryphal no doubt! Fail not at once to beat th' Allarum Drum; And 'gainst false Prophets make a goodly rout. To pious folks who borrow others' Creeds, These articles of faith I recommend, Just tell them—as good Catholics their Beads; Nor in Debate your precious time mispend: “To Britain vain is all your opposition; “Sooner shall herds of Mice a Lion fright: “Your only claim to favor, is submission, “She'l grant to that, what she denies to right. “Though like a Russian bridegroom she hath tried “Her utmost strength upon your corporation “Those stripes which decorate your tender hide, “Are but love-tokens, for your consolation. “Nay, though like any Hottentotish Priest “She hath bep'st you, till you smoke again, “Doubt not 'tis holy water, at the least, “That purifies you from each former stain. “Une foi, une loi, un Roi! be that your text: “Let mighty Quimbus be all three in one; “With thinking you no more need be perplext, “Suffice it that you say—Thy will be done!” ODE IV. TO THE SAME. Jonathan descanteth on the flight of Birds, and recommendeth to unfledged politicians to follow their example. Wild Geese on Lake Superior's margin hatch'd, Their yellow down exchang'd for jetty fledge, To southern climes in quest of food detach'd, Are seen to cleave the air in shape of Wedge: Th' experienc'd Leader, with sonorous clang, Their course directs, and distant realms explores; His note each Goose repeats with solemn twang, Till all together reach the destin'd shores. Mark then, like new fledg'd Geese, your Leader's note, Nor doubt they understand the destin'd course, Tho' Bank-directors for amendments vote The amendment for excluding Bank-directors from a seat in either house, seems here alluded to., Or Speculators, justice to enforce. Shall W ?? h run his Ship against a Rock! Shall S ?? k e'er encounter Daniel Shays The celebrated rebel and reformer in New England in the year 1787.! Shall A ? s depreciate his well-earn'd STOCK! Shall S ? n forget the Bank, or means and ways! Sooner shall water-spouts be seen on land; Sooner the timid Hind a Panther face; Sooner shall Misers give with open hands; A Courtier sooner shall refuse a place. Sooner Pacificus in Gallia's cause Shall fight, or pay her by anticipation; Sooner shall Atlas reverence the Laws, When they oppose his own predestination. ODE V. TO ECONOMY. Jonathan revileth Economy—and by a variety of Examples proves how prejudicial her advice hath been to the United States This Ode appears to have been written in the Spring or Summer of 1794. Jonathan might have produced other examples had he lived to the present period. C. C. Economy, penurious, griping Dame! Whose hands like millstones grind us all to dust, Though once a vot'ry to thy name, In thee, no more, I put my trust, Since H ??? n and K ? x have clearly shewn, Where thou art found no good can e'er be done. I knew thee once, a comely, decent Lass, Careful, and prudent as a Quaker trim, Then tell me how it comes to pass, That thou art grown so wond'rous grim? Like strolling Dinah hast thou been betray'd, And turn'd pickpocket 'cause thou 'rt not a maid? Thy treacherous advice did sure prevail When St. Clair See General St. Clair's Letter. was supplied with damag'd powder; Our army had not turn'd its tail, Could we have pop'd a little louder: But who could hope to make the Indians run, When all agree they never heard a gun! But for this trifling blunder to atone We now behold the gallant General Wayne, Amidst the desart left alone, Pays tenfold for a peck of grain See the account given by General Scott of the prices of grain, &amp;c. in General Wayne's army, Spring 1794.; On these cheap terms he holds the very place Where Butler fell—while hundreds run a race. But H ??? n your sordid schemes rejects, And boldly vent'ring for the Public Weal, That all might see those good effects, Which few, too few, were doom'd to feel, Our half-dead public credit to revive, For twenty shillings OFFERS twenty-five The reason assigned for this extraordinary policy was that foreigners might be prevented from becoming stock-holders in our funds. The Secretary of the Treasury must have been very shortsighted not to have foreseen, that it must produce the very reverse of that effect. To raise the funds above par was the ready way to invite those who wished to invest their property in secure funds, to prefer such where their stock would be of most value. And he must have known, that even at twenty-five per cent. advance, the stock-holder in the American funds would get five per cent. for his money, instead of four, which is the highest rate of interest paid in any part of Europe. It ought moreover to be remembered, that at the time of this extraordinary manœuvre public securities might have been bought for nine or ten shillings in the pound, in any part of America.. In the same noble vein of public spirit He borrows of the Dutch at five per cent, Whilst unto those who crowns inherit At only four their money's lent This fact being borrowed from the English newspapers, will no doubt obtain credit with many who might otherwise disbelieve it.. Besides a pretty, little, snug douceur, Which adds no trifling matter to the score. Resolv'd to inforce th' Excise, his fav'rite tax, He generously pays it all himself, The Duty in one place collects, And in another spends the Pelf Reader, thou mayest disbelieve this fact if it seemeth good to thee so to do; but, upon the word of an honest man, I have the best reason to believe it.. Some farmers, thus, keep horses to make grain, And only reap those horses to maintain. By his example, or his precepts taught, Congress, thy sordid policy disdains, Pays Speculators to a groat, Nor at new Loans of millions strains; But public credit to prop up intent, Expends an Eagle to collect a Cent. Economy, thy sordid fame is such, I marvel who thy Dad and Granam were, Perchance they were half Scotch, half Dutch, A thrifty, squeezing, griping pair; Of such as these a wag whom once I knew, Just from the life this faithful picture drew. SCOTCH ECONOMY—A TALE. A Scotchman who had travel'd half a year In the same shirt, still tolerably clean, As Sawney thought, but that is not so clear,— Crept naked into bed the sheets between. A wag who saw, and wish'd to know the reason, At midnight bawl'd out fire, near Sawney's head. Instant he wakes, and somewhat out of season, Runs out stark naked, as he went to bed. “Ho! Sawney,” cries the wag, “hast thou no shirt? “Or say if this be some new Scottish fashion?” Quoth Sawney, gravely, “Ken ye, I hate dirt; “And once a year, this saves both soap and washing.” Dutch Economy—a Tale, was intended to have followed here; but the original was unfortunately illegible, being written on the cover of a letter, the edges of which were rubbed and torn. C. C. ODE VI. COUSIN JONATHAN TO COUSIN PETER. Aut agitur res in scenis, aut acta refertur. Hor. Bard of the tuneful Lyre, hight Cousin Peter! By just hereditary claim Heir to the Theban Bard's immortal Fame For lofty metre, Refuse not to a younger Brother's line Some portion of thine heritage divine. Thou over sea-girt Britain's tuneful isle, Like him, on sounding pinions borne, Sailest supreme:—Whilst on a rock, forlorn, I sit the while, In wonder lost at thy stupendous height, Nor dare on feeble wing pursue thy flight. Would'st thou but from thy Zenith deign to stoop, This infant region to survey, Which scarcely thrice has seen its natal day, Thou 'dst spy a Group Of Pictures, worthy of thine exhibition In thy next Lyric Odes Academician See Peter Pindar's Subjects for the Academician.. I 'd shew thee young Ambition, like an Eagle, With stedfast eye the sun surveying, His talons stretching, and his plumes essaying; On pinions regal Mounting, he soars aloft above the stars And hurls Jove's thunderbolts about our ears. I 'd shew thee Liberty hoodwink'd, and standing Upon the trap-door of a dungeon, And mighty Atlas, with a royal truncheon, His slaves commanding To drop the platform underneath her feet, And ??? Where so many strive for pre-eminence, it would have been injurious to name one only; and the line would not admit of more. prepar'd his orders to compleat. I 'd shew thee that fame Atlas in Convention, Hammering, like any Tinman for his bread, To hammer out a crown for Cæsar's head It is not improbable that when Mark Anthony offered to place a crown on Cæsar's head, he expected to have succeeded him in the possession of it. The ATTEMPT made in the Convention bears a strong resemblance to that incident. That it did not succeed, is perhaps to be attributed only to that immaculate patriotism, which the Roman Cæsar never felt, and the American never ceased to feel.; With sly intention, Cæsar no more, to make the crown his own And bury Liberty beneath his Throne. I 'd shew HIM to thee with a crucible, Large as an oilman's jar, and busy grown As alch'mist seeking the philos'pher's stone, Now found reducible From rags and paper cram'd into the pot, Yielding a ton of gold upon the spot. I 'd shew our fed'ral Constitution torn Like a French Ensign in a naval battle, By that same Atlas and his venal cattle, Laughing to scorn Each cobweb net for conscience it contains, Fetters of pen and ink, and parchment chains. Again I 'd shew HIM to thee writing speeches For Messieurs S ? ms, and Co. to speak Some of the most eloquent speeches delivered in Congress are said to have been prepared by this versatile genius., Like puppets which their master's nonsense squeak; Which surely teaches That Representatives, if made of wood, Might do less harm—and haply, not less good. I 'd shew HIM to thee like a strolling play'r, Slipping, one part dispatch'd, behind the scene, Still prompting those that on the stage remain; He'll soon prepare Some other character to represent, An Emperor, or King, or President Doubt not gentle reader, thou wilt soon see this great Actor, like a second Garrick, appear in some new, and splendid character.. I' d shew thee worth superior led, As Dunstan led the Devil, by the nose, Blinded by spells and charms, (an ample dose To turn the head Of that fam'd chief who Circe's charms withstood) Prepar'd by Speculation's hellish brood. I 'd shew those Imps of Darkness, hov'ring round, Like Bats; or Vultures o'er a field of blood; Sucking, like Vampires Vampires, according to an ancient superstition in Europe are evil beings which haunt church-yards and hospitals, sucking the blood of the living, and preying upon the carcases of the dead., their infernal food From many a wound: Still mangling in the dark their wretched prey, They shun the odious light, and treach'rous day. ODE VII. TO DEATH Written in September, 1793. Jonathan adjureth Death to spare certain estimable Characters—Complimenteth Death on his Allies, &amp;c. Thou damn'd scape-gallows Murderer, whose darts, Have flown about, of late, as thick as hail, Or German bullets—come not to these parts, Unless thou well discern'st whom to assail. Great is thy pow'r, O Death! great thy Allies: Kings, Emperors, Czarinas, Dukes, Electors, Regents, Conspirators, Assassins, Spies Are thy confederates, and great protectors. Fear not, old boy! tho' thou should'st break thy scythe, In mowing down their unbelieving Foes; Nor spare of those vile Democrats a tythe, Who Kings, or would-be-Lordlings dare oppose. Touch not our Vice! spare all his great Compeers, But two, or three, from A—quite down to Z. Spare H ??? n to Speculators' prayers, Nor stuff with meagre K ? x thy hungry gizzard. Spare nine in ten, at least, of th' other house; No doubt thou knowest whom to decimate: Nor yet on mighty Solon come down souze, Whose well-worn mask perchance might tempt his fate; As Rhadamanthus sage, who makes orations To wond'ring pupils—and to juries lectures; To ladies publishes law dedications, And o'er poor prostrate Blackstone stoutly hectors. Who Greek and Latin speaks, from lengthy notes, And turns whole mines of learning out before ye, Classics, philosophers, and sages quotes; Which just brings to my mind a little story Histus valdè deflendus. C. C.. ODE VIII. TO NEUTRALITY. Jonathan rehearseth the advantages of Neutrality. Neutrality, thou vile Heteroclite, Uncertain in thy gender as thy face is; A dastard, squeaking, base hermaphrodite, Whom manhood to a monster but debases. Whom neither sex will own, and both despise, For favors suing both, alike in vain, To whom the gifts of Nature just suffice, To double all thy wants, and their disdain. Who, like an eunuch in seraglio bred, Art kick'd and cuff'd by those thou caterest for, Still doom'd to bow thine abject, servile head, To those whom most thine impotence abhor. Who like a truant-boy with bum well fraught With stripes that mark him for no common dunce; Or, like a thief, that's in the mainer caught, Art rifled, strip'd and whip'd or hang'd at once. Or like a capon, that's with nettles stung, To make him softer chickens not his own, Which, nurs'd and shelter'd by him whilst they're young, Are sure to peck, and beat him when they 're grown. Thy puny form put off, and dare assume Herculean limbs, and nerves, and strength, and might, So may the Gods reverse thy hateful doom, And thy dim stars reflect a lustre bright. ODE IX. TO SPECULATION. Jonathan celebrateth the virtues and blessings of Speculation. Vulgus me sibilat—at ego mihi plaudo Quoties contemplor nammos in arca. Blest Speculation! on whose paper wings: Some modern worthies rise like school boy's kite, Soaring above us with supreme delight, Whilst with the shouts below the welkin rings: Shouts, such as farmers use to crows and daws, Contempt and hatred speaking—not applause: On thy light pinions A ? s first 'gan to soar, Rising, like any sky-lark, out of sight, With S ? h pursued his bold advent'rous flight, S ?? k and W ?? h and a dozen more, Whose names are all enrolled in the Banks, An honor priz'd above constituents' thanks. Aided by thee, the Politician's sight Of error purg'd, the certain tract he spies, The game pursues with eagle's wings and eyes, And, seizing, quickens his impetuous flight: Tho' gorg'd, insatiate still! for thus employ'd Promethean vultures would be sooner cloy'd. What, though the mutilated Soldiers' wounds And carious aching stumps unheal'd remain, With not a comfort to assuage his pain, Whilst with his groans the troubled air resounds, The sordid Gripus Let no one him, or him, Sir Gripus call, Knight of the shire, he represents you all. Pope., all unfeeling, hears, Or with the victim's pension stops his ears! Let faithless Britain still with hostile arm, Infest our commerce, and our lands invade, Indians and Algerines suborn her views to aid, And hold the nation always in alarm; Thy venal train, on quarter-day intent, Submission! cry, and peace! and six per cent. O may corruption ne'er again obtain So vile an agent to promote her cause, Trampling on Justice, and her sacred laws, And prostituting conscience 'self for gain; Union shall flourish then, and strength arise, And Justice wave her banners to the skies. Stop Muse! a little story let me tell Which at the present time befitteth well. THE DRUNKEN INDIAN.—A TALE. An Indian who to Philadelphia came, The wonders of that wond'rous place to see, Was ask'd, two fav'rite wishes might he frame, Sure of the grant, what would those wishes be? “That all our rivers might turn into rum, “And all our mountains sugar-loaves become,” Quoth he. The questioner proceeds again, “Those wishes granted, what more would you ask, “If a third wish you might, likewise, obtain?” To answer now was not an easy task. He silent sits and muses as if dumb; At length in transport cries, “more RUM, more RUM!” Thus when our Conti-rags were turn'd to gold, And Speculation saw her gains untold, Which from that source and from Assumption sprung, Awhile her wishes in suspense were hung. What next shall Atlas do for Speculation? Let's have a Bank! a Bank! she cries—to damn the Nation. Another boon now offer'd from his hands See the last report made to Congress by the late Secretary of the Treasury, in which the western lands are proposed to be sold at twenty cents per acre.; Awhile in deep suspence the harpy stands; But hark! she cries out—Sell the Western Lands! ODE X. TO PANEGYRIC. Jonathan revileth Satire—Detecteth her falsities, and disclaiming all future connection with her, invoketh Panegyric. Sunt quibus in Satira videar nimis acer; Hor. —Mentiri nescio. Juvenal. To chase our spleen when themes like these encrease, Shall Panegyric reign and Censure cease. Satire, avaunt! think not that raven's plume, Which erst aloft its croaking mother bore, Now dip'd in gall, or asp's envenom'd spume, Or the Lernæn Hydra's caustic gore, Shall tempt these fingers, doom'd to other toil, One page of virgin paper, ere to soil. Whom would'st thou blacken! Whither turn thine eyes? Like aqua-fortis tho' thy breath corrode, Pure gold of both, alike, the power defies, Like armour temper'd by the Lemnian God. Vain, then, the hope, that in this golden Age, One victim shall be found to glut thy rage, Arm'd Capapee in golden Coats of Mail, Lo! S ? h and A ? s your fierce attacks despise; S ?? k grows bold—nor thinks of turning tail; As if blood-bolster'd Banquo met his eyes. This worthy character is said to have been as much affected by the name of Shays, as Macbeth by the appearance of Banquo's Ghost. Each Bank Director in defiance stands, And Speculators clap their gilded hands. O Nation blest! whose Senators display, With such success their alchymistic power! Thy Certainly Jonathan meant to use the word their, instead of thy: the sense is much more complete. C. C. rags and paper, one day blown away, The next descending in a golden shower, Like Jove!—or Himnap Mutato nomine de te fabula narratur.—who in shape of script Into his neighbour's Dish his singers dipt; This story does not bear so near an analogy to that of Danæ, as may be supposed—since I do not recollect that it is any where said that Danæ had a husband, or if she had, that he was in the secret: the denouement is said to be a state-secret, and therefore, not to be divulged But when Suspicion prickt her wolf-like Ears, A Billet-doux his reputation clears. He, like the God, in many a sly disguise Of Livery, Petticoat, or Gipsey-hat Securely hid, from prying, vulgar eyes, Steals to his assignations, like a cat: For not Grimalkin, hunting for a mouse, Makes less disturbance in Cornuto's house. Say, mighty Himnap—dost thou give and take? Secrets, for secret-services impart, Like Sampson, whilst you nightly play the rake, To each Dalilah open all your heart? Whence each Cornuto with returning morn, Like Ammon rises with a gilded horn! At Highgate I 've been told, you take an oath To kiss the mistress, and neglect the maid! Unless you better like to kiss them both; Himnap at Highgate hath been sworn, 'tis said. But groping in the dark for pretty Moll, He, like Ixion, only grasps—a doll As this story is confined to a few polite tea-tables; it is a proof that Jonathan has kept the best company in town. C. C.. Such tales you propagate—as false I vow, As ere were fish'd up out of Falsehood's well. Ah! Jonathan! you cry, I've caught you now, 'Tis there that Madam Truth is known to dwell. Caitiff, thou liest! hear it to thy face; Falsehood hath long usurp'd that Lady's place. Satire, too long have we endur'd thy reign: Tyrant, the Guillotine demands thy Head! Mild Panegyric shall thy Throne obtain, And rule by coaxing, as thou dost by dread: Like Milton, she can paint e'en Devils fair, Whilst thou would'st paint them blacker than they are. Hail Panegyric! who, of Courts the Pride, Dost Tyrants turn to Martyrs after Death; Be thou my friend, my Patroness and Guide: Dame of the Syren-voice! thy potent breath Can blow up bubbles into air-balloons, And grains of mustard swell to suns and moons; Would'st thou but in a glass-house try thy skill, We should have bottles, which a tun could fill. ODE XI. TO JANUS. Written in October 1794. Jonathan invadeth Janus—describes his different Countenances, and supplicateth him to wheel about. Jane bisions! Custos pacis! God of the double face! who towards the east, Dost, like th' adoring Persian, humbly bow; But turnest like grim Mars upon the west, The vengeful fury of thy wrathful brow: One face, in shape of Mr. Jay attends, Levees—and dines with ministers of state, Courting with smiles those ever faithful friends, And gaining in return—a chair and plate. The other scowls upon Columbia's hills, With more than Gorgon terrors in its frown; Spreading with pestilential breath those deadly ills, Which to be dreaded need but to be known. O mighty Janus! turn thyself quite round; Turn to the setting sun thy smiling face: Thus wrath shall in thine eastern face be found, And just resentment wipe off our disgrace, But if, beyond our hopes, th' insulting foe Should make atonement, keep thy temple shut. Curst be the hand that first shall strike a blow, To burst its portals—and war's rage to glut. ODE XII. TO ECHO. This ode was printed in the course of the last winter. Jonathan most musically invoketh Echo; inviteth her to the City, and to the Honours of the sitting in Congress. He rav'd and rais'd as heavy a coil as Stout Hercules for loss of Hylas, That Echo from the hollow ground His doleful wailings did resound. Hudie. Sweet Echo! lovely Nymph, that haunt, unseen, The lonely forest, and the darksome dell, The dreary cavern and the vaulted cell, And tottering tower hung with ivy green; Silent amidst the solitary scene, Where the lone screetch-owl loves to dwell; Responsive only to her fearful screams, Or neighbouring steeple's solemn knell, What time the flitting meteor gleams, Or strikes the village clock the midnight bell. O quit thy lonely haunts, and come to town, Nor dread another Swain's neglect! Such treatment ne'er again expect, Since, now, thy modest merit's fully known. The tails of sentences, alone, No more shalt thou alliterate; As when you wooed Narcissus fair, Or chid stout Orsin, bellowing for his bear; But flippant as a modern female grown, In Congress shalt thou take thy seat, And speeches, there, an hour long repeat. ODE XIII. TO THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIETIES. Jonathan revileth the Democratic Societies: vilifieth their Divinity—and rehearseth her abominable Acts of Savage Cruelty. Sons of Sedition, hide your forfeit heads, Your whilom Goddess is turn'd Cannibal! “That LIBERTY which poetry has deified as a Goddess, history proves to be a Cannibal.” Speech of Fisher Ames on the debate for censuring the Democratic Societies, Dec. 1794. Whose impious jaws our peaceful Congress dreads, More than old Rome did Hannibal. E'en W ??? n, though once her own High-Priest, Who victims slew upon her altar, At length disgusted with the bloody feast, Begins to feel his stomach faulter. What myriads hath not she of late devour'd, Upon the lower Rhine and Upper! The Alps and Pyrenees hath she not scour'd, And scarcely left enough for supper! More fatal vengeance scarcely was brought down, On wicked Sodom or Gomorrah, Egypt's first-born, or Stubborn Necho's Crown; Or, on the Poles, by general Swarrow. This bloody passover seems, after all, But just to whet her appetite: If, hungry, she should this way chance to call, Some folks may well be in a fright! ODE XIV. THE DUTCHMAN AND THE SKIPPLE-STONE. Jonathan exhorteth to reverence the Examples of our elders—telleth a Story, and concludeth with its moral. Children, respect your parents; what they've done Likewise do ye! nor think to ask the reason: That which was folly, when it first begun, Shall wisdom seem, in proper time and season. For, precedents, we know, are held as law, Can construe, fix, or change the Constitution: They are stout cords that hold the mind in awe, And fetter the attempts of Revolution. In England, Judges must on woolpacks sit; Wear bushy wigs;—sometimes a scarlet robe; This precedent directs, wherefore 'tis fit That Judges wear the same throughout the globe. At Venice ev'ry year the Doge doth wed The gentle Adriatic for his Spouse; Yet never takes her Highness to his bed, But wisely keeps another in his house. In Spain, 'tis said, by ancient feudal fight, The Lord shall kiss his vassal's maiden bride; The husband's rights commence the second night, The first to his embraces is denied. In Abyssinia, beef-stakes are cut Hot from the buttocks of a living Bull. John Bull, with horror struck, his eyes would shut Against such sights!—yet eats his belly-full Of lamb stones, whilst the victim straddling by, Blates for the loss of his delicious fry. Yet John 's no Cannibal—at most, not more Than all his ancestors have been before. Not far from Albany, among the Dutch, A skipple-stone is us'd to balance weight On horseback borne; this balance is just such As Daddy Vice requires in ev'ry state. A Dutchman who to Mill went ev'ry week, With sack half fill'd with wheat and half with stone, Was once advis'd a diff'rent course to seek; Double the wheat, and let the stone alone. The boor with wonder stares—takes off his load, Throws out the stone, and fills the sack with grain, Divides it equally, and takes the road. “Dis meal two weeks mine household shall maintain,” He cries, exulting—but a sudden thought Soon turns him back.—Again he takes the sack, And emptying half the wheat as he'd been taught, Into its place the skipple-stone puts back; Thus mutt'ring to himself as he was won't “If dis been right, mine Fader would á don't. Good folks—the moral 's easy to apply: Go, copy mother Britain all your days! Keep her example ever in your eye, Her follies mimic, and chaunt forth her praise. ODE XV. TO MERCURY. Mercuri facunde!— Te canam, magni Jovis et Deorum Nuntium. Hor. God of the winged Heels, and silver Tongue, Ambassador and errand boy of Jove, Whose honied lips are with persuasion hung, Whate'er the theme thine eloquence approve. Of Courts thou can'st unravel all th' intrigue; Each secret spring and mystery describe, Unveil a Treaty, penetrate a League, Detect a Bargain, or smell out a Bribe. If jaring interests perchance contend, The subtle agent thou, and go-between, The breach can'st widen, or contention end, Adjust the terms, or give the bribe, unseen. Patron of thieves and robbers! by thy aid, Pirates turn'd honest privateersmen, thrive; And thievish refugees, no more afraid, Shall now in turn their persecutors drive. Whate'er on earth, at present, be thy name, Camillus Camillus is the signature of the author of the Defence published in New-York. The signature of Curtius appears to have been adopted by the same, or some ether party-writers of the same kidney. If these gentlemen are not already members of the British pension-list, it seems probable that they are candidates for that honour. Curtius, H ??? n or J ? y, O let the Treaty thy protection claim, Defend the British Court and IT, I pray. O let thine eloquence unerring prove, That much to suffer is but to provoke, That hatred 's due to those we ought to love, And love to those who have our nappers broke. That perfidy is faith—to dearest friends; That faith is due but to perfidious foes; Security begins where safety ends, And peace commences with a bloody nose: That to give up is to obtain redress; To pay is to receive what is our due; That cowardice is courage ne'ertheless; Falsehood the only thing on earth that's true. See the arguments of Camillus and Curtius throughout. ELEGY. Written in April, 1795. Another C ?? s now is dead, Whose fate we all must sigh at; Two years a busy life it led, Though now it lies so quiet. Addresses did it make and mend, The time taken up the last Congress in fabricating the address to the President, cost the country a sum that would have redeemed many of our fellow citizens from slavery. One or two days debate were spent upon a single word, and several upon a paragraph. And echo back long speeches, And oft the Constitution rend, Nor ever head the breaches. Sometimes, like Captain Bobadill, Who would not have thought to have heard the indignation vomited forth against the Algerines, that THEY at least would have experienced the effects of our resentments? Even the peaceful mission of Mr. Jay was interpreted to have an object somewhat different. 'Twould stoutly swear and swagger; And fight too,—with a goose's quill, But not with sword or dagger. Old injuries it did forget, And meekly bore with new ones; For fervours dying much in debt, False friends prefer'd to true ones. The public credit to encrease, It tax'd us without ending; But lest the Public Debt should cease, Devis'd new ways of spending. Freedom of Speech and of the press, It set about curtailing, Reserving to itself no less The liberty of railing. For liberty it dearly lov'd, As Spaniard doth his spouse, Sirs; And, like him, its affection prov'd,— Confin'd her to the house, Sirs. And yet, 'twould at her sometimes rail With face as red as scarlet, That you'd suppose she was as frail As any common harlot. It had a most uncommon spite At Clubs and Democrats, Sirs; As some good folks are in a fright When they espy a Cat, Sirs. That it hath done a world of good No mortal now denies, Sirs (Although too late 'tis understood) By opening all our eyes, Sirs. Grieve not, good folks, it did not live. Like British Kings, forever; For from its ashes shall revive Another full as clever. Whilst S ? h and A ? s and S ?? k hold Their heads above the water, With Liberty they'l make as bold As if they'd fairly bought her. Nor shall there lack another field The projected sale of the Western Lands, at 20 cents per acre—(the price contemplated in the report of the late Secretary of the Treasury) if carried into effect, will afford a Banquet to the Speculators, more delicious than even the establishment of the Bank. Such a waste of national treasure would almost amount to selling the nation itself. For darling Speculation; If nothing else a price would yield, Such men would sell the nation. AN Elegiac Ode. To the memory of Doctor James Hutchinson, of Philadelphia, who fell a victim to the Pestilential Fever that raged there, Sept. 1793,—written on hearing of his Death. Saw ye the flitting meteor's transient gleam? Hear'd ye the lapwing's cry, the watch-dog's yell? The bird of night's portentous scream? That solemn, plaintive, passing bell? 'Twas Hutchinson's!—yon torpid mass of clay From bliss no more its heav'nly guest detains; To regions of eternal day, He soars, releas'd from earthly chains, Angel-choirs there shall greet him; Kindred spirits fly to meet him! The patriot firm, who for his country bled, And bless'd her with his last departing breath, Shall weave a garland for his head, And hail him victor over death; The mangled soldier, o'er whose ghastly wound He dropt the tender, sympathetic tear, With eager joy shall gather round, Still mindful of his tender care; Songs of gladness shall proclaim The welcome stranger's worth and name! Spirits releas'd from agonizing pain Of gout, or gravel, rheumatism, stone, Mingling with the joyful train, His healing art, and aid shall own: Th' abandon'd prey to pest'lence and despair, Escap'd from recent scenes of worldly woe, Shall wond'ring haste to meet him there, Whom late they joy'd to meet below; Then with him to those mansions soar Where pain and sorrow are no more. Nor envy, malice, nor detraction, there, Ten thousand dog-stars' distance dare approach; Confin'd to their own little sphere The venom shed in his reproach: Some very illiberal reflections on the Doctor, as a member of the Democratic Society in Philadelphia, appeared a short time before his death. Jonathan is indebted to two gentlemen of respectable characters in the revolutionary army, who were no friends to the Doctor's politics, for the character here given of him. But round him all the virtues, hand in hand, Smiling benignant on their fav'rite son, Shall on his spirit shall attend, As whilst his earthly course he run, His footsteps guiding towards the throne Of Life, Light, Truth, th' Eternal One! THE END.</field>
