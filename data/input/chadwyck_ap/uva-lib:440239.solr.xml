      <field name="fulltext">DEDICATORY SONNET. To Thee, dear Angel of my cherished home, Thou fair Ideal of my youth's delight, Whose all-embracing love, serene and bright, Circles my being, as the heavenly dome Encircles earth, I dedicate these lays, My Fancy's first, weak offerings; to thy heart, O! gentle Critic, shall thy Poet turn, Should colder Censors shut the gate of praise, Where, when his golden hopes have ceased to burn, And high Ambitions one by one depart, He knows the Solace, and the balm repose, To heal life's deepest wounds, and leave himâblest; For shrinÃ¨d there, th' exhaustless fountain flows Of that grand faith, whose gift isâperfect rest. THE TEMPTATION OF VENUS. A MONKISH LEGEND. I Broad in the tempered rays of the red sun, The Egyptian desert glittered leagues away, Great clouds of floating dust, confused and dun, Hung heavy on the haggard brow of Day, And veiled the fiery light of that fierce clime, As Centuries veil the land's mysterious prime. II. The parchÃ¨d palms stood motionless and mute, To plead the breezes' coming; the still sky Looked heedless on the melancholy suit, Nor sent the faintest wind to breathe reply; Nature had sunk to dumbness; no sweet voice Bade the dull soul of solitude rejoice. III. And near the horizon, a broad band of beams, Dulled by the fog of sands, was bound upon The forehead of the sickly Eve, the gleams Of whose wild eyes, all desolate, and wan, Glowed fitfully, and with that gloomy glare, Which lights the looks of passionless despair. IV. No fleet bird flying to its nightly nest, Piped a low, homeward note of innocent glee, But by the waning portals of the West, As rising to some dim Eternity, A single eagle towered in lonely state, Fronting the lurid sunset's gorgeous gate. V. And placid through the silence and the waste, A haunted realm of immemorial years, By solemn mysteries, and sad shades embraced, Where phantom Fable her weird aspect rears, And the dead Ages' ghosts in shadowy might, And shrouded grandeur, wander into Night, VI. Roll the still waters of the âbreezelessâ Nile, Like an old dream through a dismantled brain, That faintly brings the sunlight, and the smile, And the far memories of its youth again; A vision of the desert; a sublime Memento mori of the eldest time. VII. A furlong from the stream's remotest edge, The rude walls of a convent rose from out A mass of circumambient rocks, whose ledge, By a thin belt of green was girt about; A place of peaceful prayer and pious rest, Whose sacred bounds a special saint had blest: VIII. That holy man of God, whose awful zeal Struck pale the cheek of many an anchorite, Who knew his own faith cold, and could but feel, In the great blaze of Simeon's steadfast light Of grand endurance, that the hope was dim, Which promised Heaven to feeble souls, like him. IX. This sombre evening, when the vesper-psalm Had fainted to an echo, sad and low, There thrilled upon the passive season's calm, A dreary, deathlike wail of sudden wo, That left the shocked sense, quivering as it past On the hot wings of the delirious blast. X. The startled monks looked forth in haste to see What demon was abroad. Lo! the wide Heaven, A moment since, expanded tranquilly, Now seemed from its serene foundations riven, And tossed in clouds of chaos; horrid loom The ghastly eyeballs of the dread Simoom. XI. And folded in his arms' Titanic sweep, A hapless caravan of doomÃ¨d men, Rent the red air from fiery deep to deep, With frenzied cries, his breath soon stilled again; And when his flaming fury vanished by, There was no sign of life beneath the sky. XII. Yet while the monks stood gazing with the awe Of speechless horror blazoned on each face, From the spent outskirts of the storm, they saw Two shapes emergeâreeling beyond the place Of doom and desolationâhand in hand, They staggered from the burning pall of sand. XIII. Then, the good Fathers' hospitable doors Were backward dashed, and a loud shout of cheer, Such as, perchance, those lone, lethargic shores Had never roused before, rang silver-clear, And, like some rescuing Angel's tender call, Wedded with music from celestial hall, XIV. Smote on the Wanderers' hearingâa new strength Upbraced the sinking limb, the glimmering sight Grew lucid with fresh hope, until at length Saved from the wingÃ¨d Pestilence, their flight Was stayed, and Death's insatiate eyes Were turned from those he falsely deemed his prize. XV. The one, a graceful woman, the fine mould Of whose pale beauty, pointed to the land Of Helen, the divineâa cross of gold Shone on her bosom, whence the winds had fanned Her garment slightly, and revealed the snow Of the rare loveliness that heaved below. XVI. Beside her clung a boy, whose tender age Scarce filled a lustrumâthrough the starting tear, Gleamed his full, luminous eyeâthe terrible rage Of the late storm had left a touch of fear Upon his marble forehead, and the strife Sent the warm blood back to the seat of life. XVII. A wounded rose and rose-bud linked together, Borne by a tempest from Arcadian vales, And dropped within a realm of burning weather, Where the bloom withers, and the music fails, This gentle pair a kindly friendship wooed, And Christian care made bright the solitude. XVIII. But ere a single moon did wax and wane, The mother melted in the Peace above, As stars melt from the morning's purple plain; Ere lost in light, one pang her mortal love Struck to the parting soul, and dimmed its way A moment, to the Kingdom of the Day. XIX. I need not tell how, in that desolate home, The boy aspired to manhood, how the flowers Of a most noble nature 'neath the dome Of sheltering love, bloomed through the lonely hours, White, fragrant, beautiful,âso, had he then Translated been from this low sphere of men, XX. And borne among the Angels, even there, He might have stood on equal terms with them, Undazzled, walked in Heaven's auroral air, And worn unquestioned Heaven's high diadem, For Faith's pure fires had made his heart their shrine, And fused his human-life in God's divine. XXI. But when was ever known, since Time began, A Paradise of soul that did not lie Open to every desperate foe of man, To curse with crime, or blast with treachery? Philemon learned the mournful truth too late, The spirit's weakness, and the serpent's hate. XXII. And so, it chanced, when eighteen summers showed Their mellowing glory on his brow of peace, One morn, when less intense the sunlight glowed, And the still stream, in joyance of release From its hot kisses, rippled to the strand, With a low monotone, serene and bland; XXIII. Philemon, in a meditative maze Of happy fancies wandering, reached a spot, Beyond the bounds of his accustomed ways, Where the grim desert Genius lingered not, Whose bloom the lavish Spring dropped as she flew Through the still aÃ«ther, deepening all the blue. XXIV. A vale of greenery 'mid the sterile blight, Sheltered by two great hillocks, with a crown Of palm-trees fronting northward; still and bright Looked the oasis; a rill trickled down Right through the heart of the sweet place, and made A murmurous melody,âPhilemon strayed The veracious âFather of History,â in his minute Egyptian researches, made it a matter of special inquiry,ââhow it came to pass that the Nile is the only one of all rivers that does not send forth breezes from its surface.ââ Euterpe, 11. XXV. Where the waves lured him, until suddenly Beside a fountain, the glad rivulet's source, Where every gentle thing was wont to flee From the noon's sullen glare, or tempest's force, Like a grey grandsire, by a prattling child, A shadowy ruin rose from out the wild. ... Even if the supernatural element in the legend be not considered, it will scarcely be thought unwarrantable that the ruins of a Greek villa should be introduced on the borders of the desert, when we reflect that a large proportion of the inhabitants of Alexandria from its foundation were Greeks, and that nothing is more probable than that the wealthier classes among them should have indulged in the luxury of country retreats, accessible by a brief journey up the Nile. XXVI. Near it, there lay half-buried in the drift, Swathing the columns and the portico, Statues of Grecian gods, that mutely lift Their sad, discrownÃ¨d honors in the glow Of mocking skiesâeach desecrated form, The plaything of the alternate sun and storm. XXVII. With trembling limbs, and a new sense of wrong, Philemon shrank by the strange idols nigh, Entered the porch irresolute, and long Doubted, if safe it were to feast the eye More closely on this spectacleâat last, Crushing a fear, the threshold-steps were past. XXVIII. He reached a room of model strictly Greek, Supported by Corinthian shafts, that rose (Cast in the fairest form of the antique) With that aÃ«rial lightness of repose, Which crowns the perfect graceâth' ideal wrought In the clear depths of true artistic Thought. XXIX. Around, the storied walls were thickly hung With master-works of the Hellenic mind, The embodied lays the ancient Poets sung, Ere the gross world was stricken fancy-blind, And men in elemental Nature saw Glory and Love, not the cold gleam of Law. XXX. But life-like and magnificent beyond Aught else enshrined there, the Image starts Of Her, the ever-young, the fair, the fond, Whose empire is the universe of hearts, Whose influence, all-pervading and all seeing, Glows, like a golden joy, round Nature's being. XXXI. O! Venus Aphrodite! the sole birth Of perfect passion, and enduring love, Vouchsafed to excommunicate from earth All other creeds of beauty, and to prove The rapturous homage at thy happy shrine, The one, grand faith of men, all deem divine: XXXII. O! Venus Aphrodite! when the wave Of the becalmed Ãgean brought the Day A vision of that glory the Gods gave, Humanity's rough edge to melt away, The winds grew mute, the thrilled tides owned thy might, Thou Incarnation of the world's delight. XXXIII. The Sun, from his blue realm of air, looked down Into thine eyes' supreme beatitude, And formed about thy shining hair, a crown Of many rays; the Hours their haste subdued, To robe thee in transparent vestments drawn From the far woof of the ascending Dawn. XXXIV. See where she moves! the delegated Queen Of sunny shapes, sweet moods, and heavenly thought, Filling the Air with halos,âa serene Soul, from the great depths of being brought To vitalize Creation, and to stir The Heaven and Earth alike to worship her. XXXV. See where she moves! her white arms wreathed around The daintiest of the Graces, her sweet glance Most eloquent in meaning, though no sound Of song or speech hath broken yet the trance Of the lulled Ocean, and her rosy mouth Breathes only the fine odors of the South. This apostrophe to the higher qualities of Aphrodite, is purposely placed in opposition to the grosser idea of the legend. Indeed it was not until the identification of the Greek Goddess with the Roman Venus, that she became mostly a sensual Divinity. The Incarnation of love and beauty, and the representative of the eternal freshness and vivifying force of Nature, she appears the most exquisite and graceful conception in the marvellous Hellenic mythology; but the âearthinessâ of the Roman imagination was all-infecting, and under its transforming influence Aphrodite degenerated into a mere voluptuary. It was reserved for the Fathers to invest her with the additional honor of a Fiendship. XXXVI. What wonder that Philemon oft repairs To worship this new Deity; to steep His spirit in enchantment, till the years Of a full vigorous manhood rise, and leap Full-armed upon him, powerful to succeed In dragging Faith from canticle and creed. XXXVII. Thus, when the time was ripe, the legend saith, That wondrous picture's sweet original, With honeyed words, and music-laden breath, Came to complete Philemon's hapless fall; Eager he sprung, subdued to her command, And past with her, to Love's Elysian-land. XXXVIII. Two milk-white chargers bore them to the home Of FaÃ«rie, on a lustrous night in June, Glance the fleet steeds beneath the alternate dome Of sky and forest, pallid with the moon, Speeding with phantom swiftness on the wind, Which, sometimes baffled, seemed to moan behind. XXXIX. At length, they entered on a wilderness Of dusky foliage and a gloom severe, Which, like the clinging horror of distress, Hung round the trees,âa girding ghost of fearâ The tutelar Genius of a dismal realm, No tide of rays from sun, or star, could whelm. XL. Yet sudden, 'mid the dimness of the wood, A radiance like the flush of vernal eves, Stole warmly through the sombre solitude, And played in purple on the glimmering leaves; Slowly in lessening shadows, waned the night, Pervaded by that rich, voluptuous light. XLI. How shall I picture the supreme amaze With whichâan open pathway having wonâ Philemon rode into the mellowed blaze, Like muffled beams of a thin-clouded sunâ That shone from a broad Palace, lifting there Its unimagined wonders in the airâ XLII. Dome piled on dome continuous, filled the sky, With a crystalline lustre, whose clear hue, As it receded heavenward, dreamily, Like a far constellation gemmed the blueâ That drank a nebulous lustre from the spires, Remotely raised, where pale the mystic fires. XLIII. In voiceless admiration gazed the youth, On such supernal beauty; not in dreams, Or most fantastic mockeries of the truth, Upreared by Fancy, had the feeblest gleams Of a like splendor shone, presaging thence This stately and serene magnificence. XLIV. They reached the court-yard, and dismounting, past Up a grand marble stairway, flooded o'er With a glad, golden glory from the vast Interior chambers streaming evermore, Like the Aurora, glittering to and fro, Across a pallid solitude of snowâ XLV. When the last step was gained, a massive door With faint, melodious thunder rolled apart, And, standing on a rare, mosaic floor, Circled by dazzling plenitudes of art, Philemon paused, o'erburdened with excess Of novel and bewildering loveliness. XLVI. Soft in his ear a silvery accent sighs, âAdvance with me, and share my fond endeavor To tread the mazes of this Paradise, Which I have promised shall be yours forever; That you may meet, blest mortal, face to face, Th' entrancing secrets of this marvellous place.â XLVII. She seized his hand, and at that moment swelled A strain of thrilling music overhead, Sweet as the supernatural lays that spelled Earth's daughters, ere Time's early bloom was dead, When Angels wooed them, and the 'rapt sky rung Harmonious echoes to the heavenly tongue. XLVIII. These notes dissolving in a genial shower, Fell from a cloud of ever-varying glow, That where the temple's loftiest arches tower, Had been upborne from incense shrines below, And veiled within whose breast, some God of song, Outpoured a soul whose love had suffered wrong. XLIX. It rose, a passionate sea of stormy sounds, And soared, till the vast area overflowed; Then, bursting from the building's jealous bounds, Too narrow for its frenzy, it bestowed Its wild, tumultuous surges on the breeze, That sweptâa tempest thundering through the trees. L. And next, it sank, and sank, like ebbing tides By the still marge of Ocean, when the Moon Hath lulled the rippling waste whereon she rides Triumphant to the Night's unclouded noon, And a scarce visible heaving stirs the deep, Whose charmÃ¨d waves are dreaming in their sleep. LI. Again it changes; and in frolic glee, The flowing of a soft and fairy measure, Gushes upon the senses soothingly, And steeps them in a dreamy mist of pleasure, Recalling woodland bowers in vernal weather, When you and Love first wandered forth together: LII. A silver rill of most mellifluous strain, Receding to a whisper, faint and farâ Lessenedâthen lostâas in the blue domain Of distance quenched, the glory of a starâ Left a dead, desert silence, all athirst To drink in life from a fresh music-burst. LIII. Soft in Philemon's ear the Temptress sighs, âAdvance with me, for thou hast only passed The threshold of these pleasing mysteries, And but a tithe of the sweet lore amassed, With which I mean to charge thy earnest soul, As clouds are charged with lightning, and control LIV. The springs of subtler sympathies, than ere Have henceforth ruled thy being; a new sense, The motion of a longing, sweet and rare, Shall crownÃ¨d be with full intelligence, Removing from thy life the desert ban, To teach the power, and bring the bliss of man.â LV. And on through the tall colonnades they went, With linkÃ¨d hands, Philemon's eyes of fire, Dashed with the dews of madness, strangely blent With sense of sights bewildering,âthe desire Of further knowledge, and the looks that shine In his Guide's glance, flushed as with fiery wine. LVI. And now they reached a fountain's marbled brink, And now they stood in rapture by the tide, Where starry flowers were bending down to drink Fresh beauty from the waters fair and wide, Whose tremulous spray shot up as if in doubt, Lest the grand rainbow dreams should struggle out. LVII. While thus he paused, inhaling the fine mist, The balmy coolness of the great parterre, Slowly the clouds of gold and amethyst Unrolled their splendid vans along the air; And burst another vision on his brain, Whose very glory brought a touch of pain. LVIII. A vision of bright womenâdancing girls, And sylphs of lightsome action and soft grace, EnwreathÃ¨d with the whiteness of pure pearls, Perfect in limb, and exquisite in face, Poised, as if looking for a sign to mount In rhythmic measures round that mystic fount. LIX. And the sign came!âa clash of cymbals grand, And the whole dazzling throng, with glancing feet, Darted like shining arrows from the hand Of a God-Archer, into circles fleet Of matchless symmetry, and wanton art, That snared the sense, to desecrate the heart. LX. Philemon gazed till he could gaze no more, And fell, struck blind with passion; in his ears There seemed to sound the liberated roar Of the young blood, so stagnant kept for years Of bald Egyptian solitude, and so The stormier now in its unfettered flow. LXI. Soft in his ear a silvery accent sighs, âAdvance with meâdiviner secrets yet Await to crown the wonder in thine eyes, Already on the sweet fruition set Of this, our wild Elysium of all joy, Which Time can never blight, nor Death destroy.â LXII. And the fond arm that now but touched his own, Stole like a zone of fire about his breast; Uplifted from the purple-veinÃ¨d stone, O'ermastered still by a supreme unrest, He wandered with the dame down dim arcades, And the mild gloom of immemorial shades: LXIII. There, brooded Twilights of a hundred dyes, Caught from the sunsets of those lands of balm, Where deathless Summer radiates through the skies And spreads below her an immortal calm; Through the dun shadows countless pinions plied, And a Song-Spirit warbled by his side. LXIV. They reach a grotto, bowered about with vines, Whence gleam the luscious grapes thro' the dusk rays, Like sapphire globes of a soft flame, that shrines The subtle essence the wine-votaries praise, And there, through bars of deepening verdure glows A sensuous mystery of divine repose. LXV. The full-orbed Moon is setting in the West, Flooding the landscape with a Sea of splendor, The wanton Wind faints on the rose's breast In delicate dalliance, tremulous and tender, And a serene and silvery haze is spread Among the tranquil spaces overhead. LXVI. O! most bewitching Hour of all the Hours, The rugged, common Time is not thy Sire, Thou stealest forth from the voluptuous flowers, Born of their passion, and the starry fire Flushed o'er them, as a God's love bathed of old, A mortal maid in a rich rain of gold. LXVII. âPhilemon! MY Philemon!â how the tone Thrilled through him with a tender power to thrall! His scrupulous Fears, those guardian Saints, have flown, And bared to the base Evil now, is all His plastic nature;âthe long strife is past, And the mad victim blindly yields at last. LXVIII. So, on the dewy atmosphere, outgushed A world of sighs, whose amorous plenitude Stole to the Nightingale's green home, where hushed, And dreaming, drooped the Minstrel of the Wood, And set the music, sleep had frozen, free, In tropic tides of tender harmony. LXIX. The mellowed plash of fountainsâthe low breeze, That fitful rose, and sank, and died away, With scarce an answering whisper from the trees, Awed by the passion of that wondrous lay, Came, the first cloud of his soul's tempest spent, With a strange sense of drowsy languishment: LXX. But ever, if perchance on the unrest, And rosy riot of his heart, there fell The gleam of a pure thought, the Temptress guessed Its presence and its purport, and too well Plied the potential magic of that charm, Whose fiery poison worked the deadly harm. LXXI. And thus, from day to day, from week to week, From shameless month to month, the potion fed On blood of brain and body, till the cheek Grew colorless, and the sapped soul was dead, Through whose dried branches to Decay resigned, Remorse rushed howling, like a hollow wind. LXXII. The pestilential pool of Sensual Sin, Crept inch by inch upon him; to the core Each nobler impulse withered, and within The mind's waste garden, girded round of yore By holy aspirations, a foul blight Hung like the pall that circles Hell with night. LXXIII. The flowers no longer shed their sweets for him, For him, the winds no tender secret brought, The very stars in Heaven looked wan and dim, Seen through the tainted shadows of his thought; He walked a hideous realm of phantasy, Swayed by a sullen gloom, or desperate glee. LXXIV. Thus sunk, thus hopeless, this pale prodigal Of the soul's priceless treasure, on an Eve, Whose breath came chill like Autumn's, and the fall Of whose sad footsteps a low dirge did weave With faint elegiac breezes, sat beside His leman in the daylight's ebbing tide. LXXV. To hers he would have pressed his feverish lips, Her willing breast was free to his embrace, When the quick shadow of a sharp eclipse Came o'er the purple passion of her face; Her eyes were fixed with a wild, marble stare On space, and some momentous vision there. LXXVI. Philemon with a sudden, shuddering thrill, Followed her palsied looks, till he could see, Down dropping thro' the mist-wreaths, bright and still, An Image of divine serenity; Whose lucent, pitying, melancholy eyes, Shone on him like reproachful memories. LXXVII. Between his Love and him the Presence stood, With tender glance, and mien of gentlest power; The Evil Spirit cowered before the Good, As Darkness cowers, when blooms the Morning Hour, That rose from God's glad garden, that distils Its living fragrance round a thousand hills. LXXVIII. A sound like the far rush of wings uprose, O'ermastering Silence, gathering mightily, As when great flocks of birds with measured blows Of powerful vans sweep o'er the solemn sea: Then came the thunder-peal, the fiery levin, As if a star had burst its bounds in Heaven. LXXIX. And down from crystal battlement to base, The enchanted Palace crumbled into dust, To blackness sank the beauty and the grace With which the Goddess veiled the home of Lust; Whence for an instant shot a deadly glare, Flashed from the eyes of some demoniac Fear. LXXX. Philemon sought his Guide, from her to ask Fit consolation in this dread extreme, But the fair Angel had performed her task, And now, faint, fading upward as a dream, Her white plumes shamed the clouds, whose dense array, Closed into silvery splendors round her way. LXXXI. But when the form receded to a pale, Impalpable shade, like ghosts of clouds that pass Across the Moon, winged by a noiseless gale, Or the weird mist that shrouds the Wizard's glass, A solemn voice stole on him from afar, Like music melting from some mournful Star. LXXXII. âPoor Priest of Passion! thou hast fed the fire On the fierce Altar builded in thy breast, Consumed the wings of every grand Desire, And scorned the Seraph whose sweet love had blest; Thy soul hath lost its God-ward impulse long, And thou art dead to Crown, and Palm, and Song. LXXXIII. âLook back! O fallen man, and mark the way Thy pliant footsteps were not loth to tread, While blushed the aureole of a perfect day, And Christ's last word of grace was almost said, Which, uttered once, the awful veil is riven, That sways between our mortal sight and Heaven. LXXXIII. âLook back! O fallen man, and mark the bloom That blossomed on thy childhood's golden sky, Bent like a bow of promise o'er the boom Of life's uncertain Seaâa melody Most glorious sounded from those shining waves, But now the tide seems moaning overâgraves. LXXXV. âThe graves of all thy upright soul had borne Well pleasing to the Angelsâdesolate now The brooding watersâstagnant, and forlorn The sky, that laughed once, like a happy brow; And ere thy noon, the sad years sin-oppressed, Are rushing blackly downward to the West. LXXXVI. âGo forth to find thy crime's just recompense, Go forth to meet the Sorrow and the Shame, Which to the Souls who canonize the Sense, Cling ever, like fierce Serpents born of flame, Draw in earth's lowest Air thy laboring breath, And learn the full significance of death. LXXXVII. âYet from the ruin of thy low estate, A penitential patience hath sufficed To plume the heart for the Empyreal gate, And the serene benignity of Christ; In humbleness and prayer work out thy doom, Till Glory trembles from the depths of Gloom. LXXXVIII. âThen may'st thou face the Beautiful, and bare Thy willing spirit in the starry sea Of still Beatitudes,âthen may'st thou share Our God's high Noon of Immortality, And drink from His grand eyes that burn above, The quenchless light and perfect peace of love.â SONNETS. SEPARATION. Oh! nevermore on earth, nor yet in Heaven, Shall I behold thee?âif the crystal light That suns the palms of Paradise, is given To my freed vision, when the awful Night Of Sin's purgation closes, asâit must, (For in God's Providence, we humbly trust, Sin cannot be immortal) âIt suits not the eternal laws of Good, That Evil be immortalââ Festus.âeven then, Amid that multitudinous company, That throng of thronÃ¨d Powers, and ransomed men, O! nevermore thy saint-like eyes to see, Shining too far above me in the dome Of Christ's new firmament, would only be, Companionless and lorn through Heaven to roam, To walk the golden Streets, but notâof home. TO ?. Love! to thy heart as to a secret shrine, Veiled with the awe of deepest sanctity, From the o'erchargÃ¨d clouds of Fate I fly, And find a refuge and a peace divine; Then, let the tempest thunder wide and far, Beyond the storm which Pain, and Want combined, Have raised to 'whelm my manhood and my mind, Thy steadfast virtues, like a guardian-star, Point to the realms âwhere the Eternal are,â While thy calm love with a transcendent light, Yet mellowed to the chastity of Night, âMy God's sweet benediction, thus expressed,â Burns in my soul, and mantles warm and bright, O'er Grief's sad brow, till Grief itself grows blest. LINES. Love! a life-long mist of sorrow, Lifted from my pathway now, Not a cloud remains in shadow, On my heart, or on my brow; Crowned by thee, imperial Passion Thrills all space with starry light, And our misery's baffled demons, Vanish with the waning night. 'Neath the rays of this new Splendor, Drooping hopes like flowers expand, And my soul is wild with music, Fainting from Elysian-land; Scarcely can the Angels hymning Praise, where Bliss and Glory meet, Utter by the streams of Adenne Strains more solemn and more sweet. Solemn! for they come a prelude To the strife, where still we may Keep our spirits white and blameless, As in life's auroral day; Sweet! because they murmur gently, Like a voice whose silver tone Falls as fall the shaded fountains, In the wild-woods, dim and lone. Dost thou ask me if I love thee? Ay! with love our God hath given, Strong to scorn man's false conventions, Saintly, like the love in Heaven: Do I love thee?âah! divinest, Human language faints and dies, While the pale lips strive to falter What speaks only in the eyes. There are solemn depths of Passion, Whose divine, sonorous roll, Maketh Passion's self to ponder, Listening to her own great soul; Depths, undiscovered, untranslated, Tremulous as a voice of tears, But sublime as that high chorus, Pealing from the march of spheres. Come, BelovÃ¨d! clasp me closer, Let me feel thy faithful breast, Panting with a tropic rapture, Sinking to a trancÃ¨d rest; Sit we here with amorous Twilight Broken into dusky bars, And a chastened shower of glory Raining round us from the stars. THE ISLES OF THE BLEST. 'Mid the sparkling waves of the distant West, Where the sun sinks down to his evening rest, And his parting beams on the waters play, God's visible smile from the courts of day, O! never beheld by mortal eyes, A cloudless and beautiful country liesâ That unknown land! It sometimes seems In the marvellous faith of my mystic dreams, That I tread its shores of gradual slope, And drink the joy of a nameless hope, Entranced with the magic of birds, whose lay, Like the voices of angels far away, Floats ever on wings of the charmÃ¨d breeze, From the roseate heights, and the woodland leas, And thrilled with the flash of plumes that rise In purple sweep to the tranquil skies. O, joy! to walk on the blossoming wolds, While the heart of the shadowy wood unfolds, Where the Hamadryad is wont to dwell, And oreads bound through the bosky dell, And the music of pipes that are low and sweet, Steals gently after the Dreamer's feet. O, joy! to pause by the lake's green side, And gaze adown in the crystal tide, Where NaÃ¯ads twine their golden hair, In a depth of waters, calm and fair, And the winds mysterious murmurs bear From a viewless host in the halls of Air, That sound as the silver rain of rills, From the dreamy deeps of the heavenly hills. Ever do mild-eyed Memories throng, To that radiant realm of bloom and song, I inhale the sweets of ungathered flowers, The blended balm of a thousand bowers, Loading the sighs of the languid Hours,â And a veil of trance, serene and deep, Enfolds my life like an Eden sleep. When a saintly Faith hath plumed her flight To a Mount of Visions' awful height, I have traced, in that shadowy clime of bliss, The forms beloved of my soul in this; Eyes that had broken my peace in youth, Come back with the warm, deep light of truth, Eloquent eyes of a grand, calm ray, For Passion and Pride have lost their sway, Earthly feeling hath passed away, Save the still delight of its nobler part, The deathless love of a trustful heart. 'Tis sweet to know, when the world grows cold, And the years of a wearisome life are told, When the thin blood courseth chill and slow, And the soul is o'ershadowed with heavy wo, That the Pilgrim of earth may find a rest, In the far-off seas of the golden West, The beautiful Isles of the ever-blest. THE CATARACT. BY DAY. This solemn warfare of mysterious waves, This sobbing gush of a Titanic grief, The earth's great heart unto the listening winds, Hath wailed forth through the awed Eternities, Whose wings have shuddered o'er it as they past: From multitudinous fountains in the depths Of cavernous glooms, roll the exhaustless floods, Thence startled in some immemorial shock Of earthquake and of tempest, some dread strife Of orb with orb in the black void of Heaven, When ocean-tides rushed over Continents, And mountains tottered to chaotic fall, And the majestic roar of elements Shook the crazed Air, and the affrighted Space Quivered beneath the burden of the blast. The vexÃ¨d waters whirled from bursting veins, That coursed the tortured world's disruptured frame, Hissing their separate fury on the storm,â The weaker fountains, and mild cataracts, Lessened their flow, the green wolds bloomed once more, But unrestrained this universe of tides, With voice of warning and of prophecy, Speaks to us of what hath been, and may be. From the reverberant Hell that groans below, Ev'n from that Hell tumultuous floats to Heaven, The balmy incense of the Beautiful; Empurpled mists the sunshine woos to glory, Mounting, like ransomed souls, to the Great Soul, And lost in grand beatitudes of light. BY NIGHT. Lo! the calm Moon! She cometh like a saint, To charm the passionate turmoil into rest, Till to the sense of airy phantasy, The pealing surges struggle with strange awe, Pierced by the effluence of the rainbow-span, That girds the Thunderer with an arch of tears. Those heavenly beams, so eloquently fair, Shine on the frenzied, maddening mass beneath, Like the ineffable pity in the eyes Of the disowned and melancholy Christ, When, from the Ruler's Porch, he mutely looked On the blaspheming crew that cursed his love, In the thronged streets of doomed Jerusalem. A FRAGMENT. A farie soul wafted by God's own breath, And fluttering from his Paradise of light, Paused on the earth not many lustra since; The soul was spotless as the angels are, And its fair being thrilled yet with the touch Of the immortal fingers, as they clasped Its whiteness, glistening in eternity. It struck a thrill of hope in happy hearts, That beat to the blest melodies of home, And seemed to add to the sweet household chords, (Whose voice is the true music of the world,) A golden string brought from a harp in heaven. But things from God grow darkened with a blight Whene'er they fall on the sin-blasted earthâ The soul that trembled into a strange life, All dumb from the great glory of the Throne, Hath trod the ways, and speaks the tongue of man; Hath lost the mute, deep reverence, that hung Like a celestial atmosphere of prayer Round the pale purity just born in heaven; And the bright home o'er which the Cherubim Chaunted soft anthems, hath Decay enforced To be the wanton of all winds that blow: The pillar, and the pride of that charmÃ¨d sphere, The strong Corinthian column crowned with grace, Fell like a green young monarch of the woods, Struck by a sudden whirlwind; and the dove, The innocent dove, that brooded in its shade, And clung to the deep shelter of its arms, Hath fluttered wounded to the dreary earth, And mourns the tenement that moulders near. Such are thy works, O Fate! and such thy will: Thou art a Tyrant absolute in power, But for a righteous purpose; God hath thrown The burden of his judgments in thy hand, To blast the pride of our humanity; But in the far-off systems of the blest, The cycles that are endless as their King, Fate! the mysterious Conqueror of the Past, The Present's incubus, the Future's storm, Shorn of his gloominess, and freed from ties Of the dark regency that God had given, Will walk a glad immortal in the light Of happier constellations,âeven now, Oftimes, beneath his habitude of hate, We see the angel glory gleaming through. LINES. A tender word outspoken, A tender glance returned, And thoughtless peace was broken, And quenchless passion burned. Thenceforth, forever after, Shadows filled her eyes, And a low, sad laughter, Like the sweet uprise Of melodious fountains 'Mid the Elf-land mountains, Fell from her, in seeming Of enraptured dreaming, Caught from trancÃ¨d skies. How the holy story, Her deep heart's mystery, Like a chastened glory, Beautiful to see, Shone forth, softly, faintly, With a radiance saintly, From each pensive featureâ [Oh! divinest Nature, Once bound up in me!] Well do I remember That fair Italian face, But a drear December Hath eclipsed its grace; December of the stormy scorn, Of folly and of madness born, That season of infuriate weather, When Love and Hope went down together. SUNSET. There is a solemn pomp along the Heaven, That deepens in the sunset; Day hath drawn A host of bannered glories round his path, And sinks, defying Darkness, with a crown, Whose light should be immortal, and the robe, The gorgeous robe of his imperial state, Spread with a purple splendor round his fall. He dies as monarch hearts alone can die, Unconquered to the last: the clouds that clung Around his pathway all this dreary morn, Dispart at length, and through the breathless air, The vast vault of this firmament of peace, They that had veiled his brightness, share his light, The wide light of his proud, majestic eyes, And what before was worthless, takes the hues, That mount an arch of triumph in the skies. Ah! thus it is with Genius!âwhen the flame Wanes to its setting, and the envious clouds, That Wrong, and Falsehood, Treachery, and Hate, Raised to obscure it, can no more withstand The grand blaze of its concentrated power, They part, like billows from a prow of gold, And awe-struck by the greatness of their sin, Only survive, because the master-fire Darts such an universal radiance round, That they lie blushing in that glorious smile, Whose scorn is mightier than its death is sad. STANZAS. TO J. S. When Darkness encompassed my senses and soul, And the breath of the Pestilence over me stole, When the eyes of the Fearful looked misty and dim, When Love breathed a prayer, and Devotion a hymn, When the clouds of the Present around me unfurled, And my glance like a spirit's was turned from the world; There was One, and scarce less than a spirit was she, Whose smile fell upon me like light on the seaâ And bore back the waves of my fate as they rolled, Where Eternity's Day-star just bathed them in gold. All else were despondingâall else were in tears; From beneath me seemed gliding the Threshold of years, A restâas of death brooded sad o'er the room, And the low air was heavy with sickly perfume; The Destroyer's wan sceptre o'ershadowed my heart, And I thought that the Angels stood gazing apart, And signed me to come, but an Angel more dear, All bright with mortality's sweetness, was near, And I turned from the beauty of Adenne to see, Life, Hope, and Passion, brought earthward by thee. LINES. Wilt thou come hither, gentlest fair, And lift thy soft blue eyes to mine? The quiet smile that gleameth there, Wells upward from the fountain, where All fresh young fancies shine. The fountain of unsullied light, Which sparkles in each human soul, Ere Passion's pestilential blight Falls with the blackness of the night, Where those sweet waters roll. With what a calm regardfulness, Thy tender eyes do watch my own, No shadowy portend of distress, Cometh to make their joyance less, Soon to be overblown. Better those delicate limbs should sleep Beneath the emerald burial sod, Ere wo hath taught thine eyes to weepâ If thus the heart secures the deep Eternal peace of God. Mournfullest of the mournful things, That raise our sighs, and move our tears, Is innocence, that earthward brings The semblance of angelic wings, To drop like leaves in Autumn years. Then Father! summon to the blest Embracement of thy love in Heaven, This meek soul, ere the world's unrest, And passionate sins do stand confest, So broadly, they be scarce forgiven. LINES. Thou! who hast wakened secret springs, Deep in the verdure of my soul, And stirred on many a fairy knoll, In its dim shadows, purple wings Of new, and fresh Desires, that rise, Like eagles to the morning sun, Thrilled with the hope to look upon The splendor of the inner skies; Thy wondrous being, fair and good, Revolves before me in the might Of music, and the tender light Of consummated womanhood. As wandering orbs that meet in space, Our spirits met, their wild career, TransformÃ¨d in the homeless air To circles of eternal grace. And each renewed in bliss to move, And each rejoicing to have met A world of such sweet glory set, In so divine a Heaven of love. O! Souls! that breathe in mutual light, Which, if divided or withdrawn, Would leave indeed a doubtful dawn, More dreary than the dreariest night. Give us your subtlest sympathy, For ours, that intellectual life, Which blends even dissonance and strife Into majestic harmony. Through this charmed sphere to pass with thee, Where Truth and Beauty wedded are, And rounded to a silver star, Poised on its own Eternity; Is all I ask, or hope, or dream, More can a mortal life-time yield? A foresight of an ampler field, Outspread, where nobler glories gleam. LINES. [Written on Christmas-day, 1853, which fell upon the Sabbath.] Mystery of mysteries! on this holy morn, The Prince of an eternal realm of love, The Godhead veiled, in lowliest guise was born, While the far heavenly music pealed above. Triumph of triumphs! this auspicious day, The stern earth-agony subdued, and fled, Beheld the dawn of his immortal sway, The glorious resurrection from the dead. In the long cycles that the years have run, The course of their majestical advance, Hath merged with solemn wedlock into one, These sacred days' sublime significance. The birth that oped to man the heavenly gate, And gave far glimpses of supernal light, The glory of that distant, fair estate, Faded so long from his despondent sight; That birth was marvellous! but strange and grand, More strange and grand was the great Conqueror's rise From the dim confines of the shadowy land, Whose gloom had palsied faith, and dimmed the skies. Thus did the mortal learn immortal trust, Spurn the base ends for which his soul had striven, Shake from his garment earth's degrading dust, And hail a home and brotherhood in Heaven. IMAGINATION AND MEMORY. Imagination is a God, who calls Great globes of grandeur into golden light From the dim desolation of the Nightâ Who from incongruous chaos draws the law Of order and completeness, and the awe Of whose benignant Beauty fills the world; But Christ-like Memory stands within the halls Of the sepulchral Pastâwhich at the dread, Deep summons of that voice, gives up its dead. ON ?. Thy cheek hath lost its happy flush and bloom, Thine eye its light; And the fresh fragrance of life's flowery morn, Alas! hath vanished quite: Pale the sweet garden, where a season since The rose did blow; And haunted only by a tender shade, A flitting, ghostly glow: Solemn and spiritual, and very sad, Like the far smile That beams from the Madonna's face divine, In some dim convent aisle. The Earth to thee smiles only from her tombsâ Thou standest lone, Where in thy darkened, and o'erclouded path, Expiring joys are strewn: Joys that have withered suddenly and dropped From stately stems Of thy green Hopes, once beautiful, and crowned With dewy diadems: And standing there all desolate, and lorn, Thy spirit grieves, As grieve the winds of Autumn, at the fall Of Summer's wealth of leaves. I gaze upon thy face, serene and fixed, Pallid and calm; Tranced with a vision of the land of rest, The Pilgrim's conquering palm. Yet sometimes, turned from glory, thy sad soul Dissolves in tearsâ When, like a loosened Falcon, Memory mounts Thy Heaven of youthful years. Thy far-off Heaven of vanished years and youth, Where past delights Shine in cold distance, like the freezing stars Of the pale Arctic nights. Fading, and oh! how faint and desolate, Thy form doth seem, And hour by hour thy wan face waxeth dim, And shadowy as a dream. The dream will melt from our horizon soon, In higher skies, Already meanings, mystical and strange, Float in thine eyes. And through those gentle lights, thy gentler soul Too well I know, Is passing up in dimness and in tears From mortal wrong and wo. THE GOLDEN AGE. âSaturn, after having been deprived of his destructive power, escaped the fate of the other Titans, and fled to the plains of Latium, where he concealed himself, and transferred thither the Golden Ageâthat happy period when mankind lived in a state of perfect equality, and all things were in common. He is said to have arrived in a ship at the Tiber, in the dominions of Janus, and in union with him to have reigned over men with wisdom and benignity.ââ Dwight's Mythology. A ship with lofty prow came down To Latium's strandâ A God had burst from severed chains, To rule the land. Plenty and smiling Peace sprung up Beneath his treadâ Earth blossomed like Hesperian fieldsâ Discord was dead. Heaven, with its calm, supernal light, Had blessed the spotâ And Misery in the enchanted realm, Durst enter not. Life passed away, like holy dreams On spring-tide evesâ And melted as the sunset melts From violet leaves. From haunted wood-shades genii flew, In twilights dimâ Nature and human hearts drank deep Their 'wildering hymn. Earth, air and heaven entrancÃ¨d wereâ A cloudless clime Hung, like transparent dews, around That Golden Time. Those golden years have passed, to come In purer lightâ Their hopes that sleep, but are not dead, Will chase the night. Time from the dungeon-vault of Sin Will strongly burst, And glorious in his wrath cast off His chains accurst. A God will reach from viewless realms This mortal shore, And dark-robed Misery flee his face, Forevermore. ASPIRATIONS. To have the will to soar, but not the wings,â Eyes fixed forever on a starry height, Where stately shapes of grand imaginings Flash down the splendors of imperial light; And yet to lack the charm that makes them ours, Th' obedient vassals of that conquering spell, Whose omnipresent and ethereal powers, Encircle Heaven, nor fear to enter Hell; This is the doom of Tantalusâthe thirst For beauty's balmy fount to quench the fires Of the wild passion that our soul hath nurst In hopeless promptingsâunfulfilled desires. Yet would I rather in the outward state Of Song's immortal Palace lay me down, A beggar basking by that golden gate, Than bend beneath the haughtiest Empire's crown. For sometimes, through the bars, my trancÃ¨d eyes Have caught the vision of a life divine, And seen a far, mysterious rapture rise Beyond the veil that guards the inmost shrine. LINES. We walk, unconscious, blind Somnambulists, All girded round with the dull mist of dreams, Among the shadows of our shifting years; Blindly we stumble onward, step by step, Near the precipitous edges of our Fate, Nor deem how many footfalls, or how few, Divide us from the fearful gulf that waits, âA Horror, ghastly with mysterious glooms,â To whelm us in its dim, Tartarean depths. We gaze on beauty, but while yet our eyes With the bright drops of rapture overflow, The beauty wanes, and passes into Heaven; Till at the last, we learn to look beneath The blush that masks, and mark the stealthy worm, And all the loveliest Images of earth Grow mournful to our sad Philosophy. Only, irradiate with the dews of youth, And its empurpling atmosphere of joy, Our false Life puts a Halcyon glory on; O! golden-tinted years, when in the sky We see bright shapes, and hear a tender voice Of benediction, when the Winds reveal Their mystic thoughts to our attunÃ¨d ears, And not a violet blossoms on the lea, And not a leaf is quivering in the light, And not a song of any bird that flies By the lone beach, or through the woodland aisles, But comes the special delegate of Heaven, To strike a morning sunshine on the soul. But soon, the early splendor pales and dies, But soon, the flowers, the woodlands, the glad birds, No longer own a blest Interpreter; But treacherous Sin, with heavy-lidded Grief Close following after, brands the Universe With the funereal blazonry of wo. O! grant me but once more, for the last time, Ere falls the black Night weltering in its shades, The gift of childhood's glorious Alchemy, That turns even gloom to gladness, and the dross, (Or what we wise Philosophers term dross) Of lowliest things, to golden mines of bliss; O! give me back Belief, the unfaltering Trust In man, in Nature, and in Providence, That arched the Air with rainbows, and the earth Thrilled with the music of harmonious tongues, Till in the multitudinous forms of being, The humblest to the highest, I may find One soul of beauty, and one voice of God. TO ?. Thy life hath been a warfare from the first, But one by one thou hast besieged and burst The iron gates of Prejudice, and wrung Tardy confession from an enemy's tongue, Of the just might of genius and of will, Against their petty instruments of illâ The sneer of ignorance, and the scorn of pride, The blinded, arrogant folly that would ride Rough-shod o'er merit, and the pomp of place That fain would deem it somewhat of disgrace To bend its shallow dignityâand know It doth receive an honor, not bestow, When one whom God hath gifted with the dower Of lofty foresight, and rich words of power, Accepts that homage which a luminous Fate Decrees the Small must render to the Great. At last upon thy brow, despite of them, Fame sets her broad, imperial diadem, And not a jewel blazes in that crown, But gleams a separate scorn to quail them down. A FRAGMENT. Truth, like Death, bends a stern gaze on man, And in the awful calmness of her eyes, Fate sits, a shrouded, solitary God, Glooming the depths of their Eternity.</field>
