      <field name="fulltext">Pallas. You say there's a sameness in my style, You long for the savor of something new, You tell me that love is not worth while, You wish for verse that is strong and true. Well, I will leave the choice to youâ Prose or poetry, short or long, Only we'll let this be the cueâ Love is excluded from the song. I'll sing of some old cathedral pile, Where, as we sit in a carved oak pew, The sunlight illumines nave and aisle, And peace seems thrilling us through and through. No? you don't think that will do? How would you like a busy throng, A battle, Elizabeth's retinue? But love is excluded from the song. A journey, a voyage, a tropic isle, The hush of the forest, the ocean blue, A lament for all that is false and vile, A pÃ¦an for all that is good and true, Pompadour's fan, or Louis's queue, Mournful or merry, right or wrong. Subjects, you'll find, are not so few, But love is excluded from the song. Oh! for a song of yourself you sue! Do you think you can trap me? You are wrong. Sing of your eyes and your smile andâPooh! Love is excluded from the song. The Convert. I wrote lots of trash about Cupid, And the telling bewitchment of curls, And that men were excessively stupid To be madly devoted to girls. I remarked that true love was unstable, As compared with position or pelf, 'Til one day I met you, little Mabel, And learned what it felt like, myself! Don't read all the things I have written When I knew that my heart was my own, But since I confess I am smitten, Read these little verses alone. And sincerely I trust I'll be able To convince you, you sly little elf, To grant me your heart, little Mabel, And learn what it feels like yourself! A Fickle Heart. A fickle heart! Let subtler poets sing Of changeless love and all that kind of thing, Of hearts in which a passion never diesâ My heart's as fickle as the summer skies Across whose face the changing cloud-forms wing. Unfailing loves unfailing troubles bring. I love to touch on Cupid's harp each string, Though each unto my questioning touch replies A fickle heart. So, 'twixt some thirty loves I'm wavering, To each the same unstable vows I fling, Reading the first glad gleam of love's surprise In thirty pair of brown and azure eyes, Finding in all the same thought answering A fickle heart. Then and Now. When first we met she was three feet high, And three, I think, was her age as well, A touch of the heaven was in her eye; I cannot say she was very shy, (As you'll see by her actions by and by), But the way I behaved I blush to tell. We met at a party, on the stair; She was decked in ribbons and silk galore, She smiled with a most bewitching air, And then, I'm afraid, I pulled her hair. You know you can't expect savoir-faire Of a cavalier of the age of four! She only laughed with her subtle charm, And took it more sweetly than you'd have believed, But later she really took alarmâ When she wanted to kiss me I pinched her arm, And she ran away to escape from harm; At which, no doubt, I was much relieved. She did not offer to kiss again; I saw her go off with another beau, She pretended to hold up her ten-inch train, And whispered low to her new-found swain. I was eating ice-cream with might and main,â And that was some seventeen years ago. I see her to-night on the winding stair, She replies with a smile to my sober bow; The palms lean lovingly toward her hair, And her foot keeps time to a distant air. I'm afraid she does not recall or care She does not offer to kiss me now! Heigho! What a sad, what a sweet affair, What a curious mixture life seems to be! I am fast in the net of love, and there, With another man on the winding stair, Is the girl I love,âand I pulled her hair When she wanted a kiss at the age of three! L'Amour, L'Amour. We catch the fleeting perfume of roses As the evening closes the golden day, And the rhythmic beating of waves in motion Comes from the ocean a mile away; In the west is dying the sunset's splendor, And twilight tender enfolds the land; Where the tide is flying a-down the river, And the grasses quiver, we silent stand. In your radiant eyes the sun unknowing Has left his glowing to deeper glow, And your tender sighs sound far more sweetly Than the winds that fleetly and blithely blow And first all shyly your small hand lingers With trembling fingers within my own, The blushes slyly and swiftly starting, And then departing like rose-leaves blown. Alas, the envious time is fleeting, But your heart is beating in time with mine, And Cupid's rhyme rings louderâclearer, As I draw you nearer, my love divine! In the twilight dim we have found love's tether, And are linked together, no more to part; While the white stars swing in a maze of glory, To hear the story that bares your heart. A Memory. We sat in the lamplight's gentle glow, Alone on the winding stair, And the distant strains of a waltz fell low On the fragrance-laden air. I caught from her lips a murmured âyes,â And the stately palms amid There came a blissful, sweet caressâ I shouldn't haveâbut I did! I might forget that joyous night, As the months slip swiftly by; I might forget the gentle light That shone in her hazel eye; But I can't forget that whispered âyesâ That came the palms amid, I can't forget that one caressâ I shouldn't haveâbut I did! Ballade of Justification. A jingle of bells and a crunch of snow, Skies that are clear as the month of May, Winds that merrily, briskly blow, A pretty girl and a cozy sleigh, Eyes that are bright and laughter gay, All that favors Dan Cupid's art; I was but twenty. What can you say If I confess I lost my heart? What if I answered in whispers low, Begged that she would not say me nay, Asked if my love she did not know, What if I did? Who blames me, pray? Suppose she blushed. 'Tis the proper way For lovely maidens to play their part. Does it seem too much for a blush to pay If I confess I lost my heart? What if I drove extremely slow, Was there not cause enough to stay? Such opportunities do not grow Right in one's pathway every day; Cupid I dared not disobey, If he saw fit to cast his dart; Is it a thing to cause dismay If I confess I lost my heart? ENVOY. What if I kissed her? Jealous they Who scoff at buyers in true love's mart. Who can my sound good sense gainsay If I confess I lost my heart? A Passing Song. Ah, only love I have ever known, Ah, only love I shall ever know, The careless hours of youth have flown And the light-hearted past to the winds is thrown, And faster and faster the hours go. In your heart and mine there's a secret lying While the spring's breath thrills in the air of May, While life seems ever to be defying The flight of time and the thought of dying, And the great world runs on its careless way. Yet one dear thought in my heart is resting As I face the path I must tread ere long, When wearied with life's unending questing, Its tawdry joys and its idle jesting, I shall pass to the midst of the missing throng. That here I have known your heart's dear thrilling, Your helping hand and your watchful eye, My life with your tender love fulfilling. I know but this, and am strangely willing To learn your love and in learningâdie. Friends. The wintry sky may be chill and drear, And the wind go sighing in mournful strain, Or it may be the spring of the waking year, When flowers and birds return again. Be it March or May, it matters not, Snow or violets on the ground, I know a little bewitching spot, Where it is fair the whole year round. A low tea-table set out for two, A divan with cushions piled on high, Dresden tea-cups of pink and blue, A fat little kettle simmering nigh, In winter a fire that cracks and roars, In summer a window where breezes play. What if it hails or snows or pours, In that little spot it is always May. A girlâof course, you will say, when one Describes such a haven from life's mad whirl. There must be a wait till my song is done. This is such an entrancing girl! Cheeks as fresh as a summer rose, Eyes that change like the changing sea, Lips where a smile first comes, then goes, And, oh! but she makes delicious tea. So we sit and talk while the kettle sings, And life seems better at least to me, The fleeting hours have golden wings, When in that little spot I'm drinking tea. Love? Ah, no, we are far above Such folly. Our time we can better spend. This world is brimming with loveless love, But 'tis rarely enough one finds a friend. The Captive. I've sought for Cupid by day and night. But he always contrived to elude me, And kept discreetly out of my sight, Nor showed his face, the crafty wight, Nor e'er for a moment sued me. And often while for his face I sought I thought with a thrill I had found him, By my little wiles and my coaxing caught, Or even for gold ignobly bought, With his arrows and bow around him. But now my pulse gives a fresh, wild start, And a throb of joyous surprise, dear, As I see him, armed with his subtle dart, A fellow prisoner with my heart. In the depths of your hazel eyes, dear. The Unwilling Muse. Oh, nothing in all life worse is, For abating superfluous pride, Than having to scribble on verses With the editor waiting outside; I am hearing a lecture on Shelley, Where I ought to be able to dream, But my brain is as vapid as jelly, And I cannot alight on a theme. The bell rings. My friend, the Professor, Is beginning to read out the roll. How time drags! Am I present? Oh, yes, sir, But, oh, what a blank is my soul. I fear that my cunning has left me, Inspiration refuses to guide, The muse of her aid has bereft me, And the editor's waiting outside.</field>
