      <field name="fulltext">PUSS IN BOOTS. Once upon a time there was a miller who had three sons, and when he died he divided what he possessed among them in the following manner:âHe gave his mill to the eldest, his ass to the second, and his Cat to the youngest. Each of the brothers accordingly took what belonged to him, without the help of an attorney, who would soon have brought their little fortune to nothing, in law expenses. The poor young fellow who had nothing but the Cat, complained that he was hardly used: âMy brothers,â said he, âby joining their stocks together, may do well in the world; but for me, when I have eaten my Cat, and made a fur cap of his skin, I may soon die of hunger!â The Cat, who all this time sat listening just inside the door of a cupboard, now ventured to come out and address him as follows: âDo not thus afflict yourself, my good master: you have only to give me a bag, and get a pair of boots made for me, so that I may scamper through the dirt and the brambles, and you shall see that you are not so ill provided for as you imagine.â Though the Cat's master did not much depend upon these promises, yet, as he had often observed the cunning tricks Puss used to catch the rats and mice, such as hanging by the hind legs, and hiding in the meal to make believe that he was dead, he did not entirely despair of his being of some use to him in his unhappy condition. When the Cat had obtained what he asked for, he began gaily to equip himself: he drew on his boots; and, putting the bag about his neck, he took hold of the strings with his fore paws, and bidding his master take courage, immediately sallied forth. The first attempt Puss made was to go into a warren, in which there was a great number of rabbits. He put some bran and some parsley into his bag; and then, stretching himself out at full length as if he was dead, he waited for some young rabbits, who as yet knew nothing of the cunning tricks of the world, to come and get into the bag, the better to feast upon the dainties he had put into it. Scarcely had he lain down before he succeeded as well as could be wished. A giddy young rabbit crept into the bag, and the Cat immediately drew the strings, and killed him without mercy. Puss, proud of his prey, hastened directly to the palace, where he asked to speak to the king. On being shown into the apartment of his Majesty, he made a low bow, and said: âI have brought you, sire, this rabbit from the warren of my lord the Marquis of Carabas, who commanded me to present it to your majesty with the assurance of his respect.â âTell my lord Marquis of Carabas,â replied the king, âthat I accept of his present with pleasure, and that I am greatly obliged to him.â Soon after, the Cat laid himself down in the same manner in a field of corn, and had as much good fortune as before; for two fine partridges got into his bag, which he immediately killed and carried to the palace: the king received them as he had done the rabbit, and ordered his servants to give the messenger something to drink. In this manner he continued to carry presents of game to the king from my lord Marquis of Carabas, once at least in every week. One day, the Cat having heard that the king intended to take a ride that morning by the river's side with his daughter, who was the most beautiful princess in the world, he said to his master: âIf you will but follow my advice, your fortune is made. Take off your clothes, and bathe yourself in the river, just in the place I shall show you, and leave the rest to me.â The Marquis of Carabas did exactly as he was desired, without being able to guess at what the Cat intended. While he was bathing the king passed by, and Puss directly called out as loud as he could bawl: âHelp! help! My lord Marquis of Carabas is in danger of being drowned!â The king hearing the cries, put his head out at the window of his carriage to see what was the matter; when, perceiving the very Cat who had brought him so many presents, he ordered his attendants to go directly to the assistance of my lord Marquis of Carabas. While they were employed in taking the marquis out of the river, the Cat ran to the king's carriage, and told his majesty, that while his master was bathing, some thieves had run off with his clothes as they lay by the river's side; the cunning Cat all the time having hid them under a large stone. The king hearing this, commanded the officers of his wardrobe to fetch one of the handsomest suits it contained and present it to my lord Marquis of Carabas, at the same time loading him with a thousand attentions. As the fine clothes they brought him made him look like a gentleman, and set off his person, which was very comely, to the greatest advantage, the king's daughter was mightily taken with his appearance, and the Marquis of Carabas had no sooner cast upon her two or three respectful glances, than she became violently in love with him. The king insisted on his getting into the carriage, and taking a ride with them. The Cat, enchanted to see how well his scheme was likely to succeed, ran before to a meadow that was mowing, and said to the haymakers: âGood people, if you do not tell the king, who will soon pass this way, that the meadow you are mowing belongs to my lord Marquis of Carabas, you shall be chopped as small as mince-meat.â The king did not fail to ask the haymakers, to whom the meadow belonged? âTo my lord Marquis of Carabas,â said they all at once; for the threats of the Cat had terribly frightened them. âYou have here a very fine piece of land, my lord marquis,â said the king. âTruly, sire,â replied he, âit does not fail to bring me every year a plentiful hay crop.â The Cat, who still went on before, now came to a field where some other labourers were making sheaves of the corn they had reaped, to whom he said as before: âGood people, if you do not tell the king, who will presently pass this way, that the corn you have reaped in this field belongs to my lord Marquis of Carabas, you shall be chopped as small as mince-meat.â The king accordingly passed a moment after, and inquired to whom the corn he saw belonged? âTo my lord Marquis of Carabas,â answered they very glibly; upon which the king again complimented the marquis upon his noble possessions. The Cat still continued to go before, and gave the same charge to all the people he met with; so that the king was greatly astonished at the splendid fortune of my lord Marquis of Carabas. Puss at length arrived at a stately castle, which belonged to a Magician, the richest ever known; for all the lands the king had passed through and admired were his. The Cat took care to learn every particular about the Magician, and what he could do, and then asked to speak with him, saying, as he entered the room in which he was, that he could not pass so near his castle without doing himself the honour to inquire after his health. The Magician received him as civilly as a Magician could do, and desired him to be seated. âI have been informed,â said the Cat, âthat you have the gift of changing yourself to all sorts of animals; into a lion or an elephant, for example.âââIt is very true,â replied the Magician, somewhat sternly; âand to convince you I will directly take the form of an elephant.â The Cat was so much terrified at finding himself so near to an elephant, that he sprang from him, and climbed to the roof of the house; but not without much difficulty, as his boots were not very fit to walk upon the tiles. Some minutes after, the Cat perceiving that the Magician had quitted the form of an elephant, ventured to come down from the tiles, and owned that he had been a good deal frightened. âI have been further informed,â continued the Cat, âbut I know not how to believe it, that you have the power of taking the form of the smallest animals also; for example, of changing yourself to a rat or a mouse: I confess I should think this impossible.ââ âImpossible! you shall see;â and at the same instant he changed himself into a mouse, and began to frisk about the room. The Cat no sooner cast his eyes upon the Magician in this form, than he sprang upon him and devoured him in an instant. In the mean time the king, admiring as he came near it, the magnificent castle of the Magician, ordered his attendants to drive up to the gates, as he wished to take a nearer view of it. The Cat, hearing the noise of the carriage on the drawbridge, immediately came out, saying: âYour majesty is welcome to the castle of my lord Marquis of Carabas.ââ âAnd is this splendid castle yours also, my lord Marquis of Carabas? I never saw anything more stately than the building, or more beautiful than the park and pleasure grounds around it; no doubt the castle is no less magnificent within than without: pray, my lord marquis, indulge me with a sight of it.â The marquis gave his hand to the young princess as she alighted and followed the king, who went before; they entered a spacious hall, where they found a splendid collation which the Magician had prepared for some friends he had that day expected to visit him; but who, hearing that the king with the princess and a great gentleman of the court were within, had not dared to enter. The king was so much charmed with the amiable qualities and noble fortune of the Marquis of Carabas, and the young princess too had fallen so violently in love with him that when the king had partaken of the collation, and drunk a few glasses of wine, he said to the marquis: âIt will be your own fault, my lord Marquis of Carabas, if you do not soon become my son-in-law. The Marquis received the intelligence with a thousand respectful acknowledgments, accepted the honour conferred upon him, and married the princess that very day. The Cat became a great lord, and never after ran after rats and mice but for his amusement. DESCRIPTION OF THE PLATES. Illustrations accompany each section of the poem in the source text. PLATE I.âFRONTISPIECE. Puss, like the heroes of the human race, Claims on our title-page the foremost place; And trusts his portrait may his readers win, For more particulars to look within. PLATE II. The weary old miller lay dead in his grave; And he left his three sons all the wealth he could saveâ The mill and the ass, and the great gray cat; John and Jacob took these, and poor Will took that. On the ass, by the gateway, sat Jacob one morn, While his brother, the eldest, was grinding his corn; And within was young William, as sad as could be; âFor what can I do with a pussy?â said he. Pussy set up his back to his master's surprise, Looking full in his face, with his knowing, green eyes; And thus, in an accent uncommonly shrill, He warmly replied to our wondering Will: âGood breeding forbids, that I walk through the street, Among all the Ã©lite, without boots to my feet; Just order a pair, and I'll soon let you see, If Johnny and Jacob are richer than we.â There was that in his look, which astounded the youth, A mixture of cunning, of wisdom, and truth; But ere Will, in amaze, could an answer begin, A shoe-maker passed, so he bade him come in. PLATE III. Puss mounted the arm-chair, as grave as a judge, John muttered âridiculous!ââJacob cried âfudge!â But Will, with a smile at this joke of the brute's, Said, âMeasure our friend for a stout pair of boots.â The shoe-maker, glad of a job, set to work, While he cried, with a scarcely perceptible shirk Of his head, where his patron laid one of his paws, âIf you please, my young customer, draw in your claws!â He stroked Puss's leg, and with pleasure Puss purred, Then turned to his master, who silently heard, âGood William, I love you; for, gentle and bland, Full many a favor I owe to your hand. âThat hand oft caresses, while softly I purr, And you try not to stroke the wrong way of the fur, You let me sleep all undisturbed in the sun, And never have teazed as your brothers have done.â âOh! call me not faithless as other men do! I look for more liberal judgment from you; They hate us because we will ever be free, But I'll show you how grateful a pussy can be.â âLet the dog to the tyrant crouch, servile and tame! It is thus he has earned him his station and name; While we've claws, while we've teeth, for our nine lives to fight, We fawn not, we yield not, we stand to our right!â âTo truth, to affection, to justice, we show, The powers that tyranny never shall know; Your love has unsealed e'en my voice from its band, Confide in your cat, and his talents command!â He held out his paw with a dignified grace, While the loftiest sentiment shone in his face; And touched with the eloquent speech of his friend, Will took it, and promised to trust to the end. PLATE IV. Puss pulled on the boots, which the shoemaker made, Who praised the nice fit and desired to be paid; Alas! his last shilling, Will sadly drew out, While Jacob and John made a terrible rout;â âWhat, throw your sole penny away on a brute, Who will take to his heels, with your present to boot?â âNay, look!â exclaimed William, âand read with surprise, The indignant denial in Pussy's green eyes!â In silent contempt Pussy shrugged up his back, Took a stick in his paw, o'er his shoulder a sack, And on his hind legs, like a man, to the door He stepped, turned and bowed, and they saw him no more. PLATE V. Now the king of the country had been a long time In a fit of despondency truly sublime; It was not that over his realm of delight, War, famine, or pestilence stole with their blight; It was not that Parliament thwarted his will, Oh, no! it was something more terrible still; My reader will scarcely his anguish disdain, When I tell him he could notâa partridge obtain! The fields, it is true, had their usual supply, But the creatures had grown so remarkably shy, Not a sportsman could boast one from near or from far, Though true in his aim, as the steel to the star. Pussy went to a cornfield; his boots he threw by, Lest the birds at their noise should be frightened and fly; Then opened his sackâheld it fast by a string, And behind a thick hedge, he lay ready to spring. The birds saw the crumbs, in the bag, that were set, One after another hopped into the net; Then Puss drew the string up, and whipping the sack, Birds and all, o'er his arm, to the palace went back. The monarch was cross, as a monarch could be, âI've not had a dinner these six weeks,â said he; The Parliament sat, but no favor could win, When a gay lord in waiting came hastily in: âA person, who strangely resembles a cat, With his tail, and his whiskers, his fur, and all that, Stands without, with a present of partridges, Sire, Which he brought, as he says, by his master's desire.â âThe meeting's dissolved!â quick the monarch did cry, âWhat are kingdoms to me when a partridge is nigh? What ho! let him enter!âthis game-keeper rare!â Pussy came, bowing low, 'mid the general stare. And turning his head, lest the sight of the birds Should tempt him, he emptied his bag with these words: âThe Marquis of Carabas bids me entreat To lay his poor gift at your majesty's feet.â âBy St. George,â said the king, âyou're a messenger fine! Why comes not to court this fair marquis of mine? Now hasten, Sir Walter, and bid, do you see? The Chancellor of the Exchequer come hither to me!â He cameââMy Lord Chancellor, fill up yon sack With what gold the game-keeper can bear on his back.â (You can see in the picture the Chancellor gray, And the members of Parliament stalking away.) PLATE VI. By nature generous, frank and gay, And proudly brave was William Grey; The village girls, that tripped along The fragrant field at harvest tide, Would pause amid their peasant song, And blushing archly, glance aside, When William's rich and mellow tone Gave joyous echo to their own. His chesnut curls and dark blue eyes, His winning smile and manly form, In many a soul more fond than wise, Unwitting roused Love's summer storm; But fancy free, and light of heart, With gay disdain he shunned the dart. â'Twill never do!â cried gallant Will, âMy kindly brothers bid me share The profits of the ass and mill; But no! I'll fortune seek elsewhere!â Just then our roguish puss appeared, Winking his eyes, so wise and weird, And on the table gravely told, Piece after piece, the glittering gold. âAnd whence is this?â his master cried, â'Twas fairly earned!â the puss replied, âYou stare! distrust's an odious thing; Go, if you doubt me, ask the king!â Amused, but touched to see his pride, Will kindly drew him to his side; Again he vowed to trust him still, Received the gold, nor dreamed of ill. And now the cat did daily bring His favorite birds to please the king; You see him by the kitchen grate, He stands in dignity and state; Like Bonaparte, illustrious chief, Who swept whole nations from his track, And, little caring for their grief, Stood with his hands behind his back. Yet puss, instead of killing men, The terror only was of rats, And lives, recorded by our pen, The great Napoleon of cats. The cookmaid plucks the birds he brought, While two of them the fool has caught; The coachman enters, calls for beer, And cries, âThe king's a bore, my dear! I have some business of my own That calls me urgently to town, And yet he orders me to take Him and the princess to the lake!â Puss heard, and slyly slipped away; He found his master blythe as May, And begged him, strange as it might seem, To come and bathe within the stream. Will followed, careless where he went, To please his friend his sole intent. PLATE VII. So sultry is the day, in truth, The water tempts the willing youth; He springs to meet itâpuss receives, And hides the clothes his master leaves; Then, as his majesty drives by, The cat sets up a doleful cry, And wrings his handsâI mean his pawsâ âStop!â cries the king, âI'll know the cause!â Descending from the coach, he calls His little favorite to his side: âWhat mean,â he asked, âthese fearful squalls?â When thus demurely puss replied: âAlas! the while in yonder lake My master bathes, his splendid clothes Some wandering thief has dared to take, And he must stay there, I suppose! He'll catch his death of cold!âââNo, no! Hasteâto the royal wardrobe go! Bring thence a suit!ââAs thus he said, The king caressed his favorite's head. Meanwhile young William, mute, amazed, Between the waving branches gazed, And saw a vision of delight, âThat soon became a part of sight.â Within the coach a graceful girl, With hair of gold and teeth of pearl, Sat blooming like a rose-bud rare, That blesses all the balmy air; The loving heaven had lent her eyes The hue of its own summer skies; And on her cheek, by mischief sent, A sportive dimple came and went. The royal suit was quickly brought, Will donned it with abstracted thought, And half repenting what he did, Followed the king, as he was bid. 'Twas but a momentââWhat!â cried he, âSince fate, the king, and puss agree, To make a noble lord of me, Shall I deny the royal sway? The king can do no wrong, they say, I'll take his word for 't, come what may!â Then with a gay, but courteous grace, He to the monarch bowed assent, Before the princess took his place, And off like light the coursers went. PLATE VIII. So puss ran before, till he came to a wood, Where hundreds of wondering woodcutters stood; âTo whom does this forest belong?â said the cat.â âTo the awful magician.âââNo matter for that; Now mark! if his majesty, when he comes by, Should ask, you must say, or ere sunrise you die, To the Marquis of Carabas.âââYes,â said the men, And away galloped puss, with a chuckle again. Then he came to a wheat-field; the reapers amazed, Like the woodmen stood trembling, and sheepishly gazed On the small hairy man of such marvellous size, With his tail and his claws, and his boots and his eyes. â'Tis he, the magician himself!â whispered they; For they knew that he took a new shape every day. âTo whom does this wheat-field belong?â said the cat.â âTo the fearful magician.âââAh, ha! say you that? If you have no particular fancy to be, This moment, cut up into mince meat for me, Be sure, when the king comes this way, to explain, That this is the Marquis of Carabas' grain.â They took off their hats, and they vowed to obey, And the frightened child wondering, paused from its play; And the maiden peeped out from the golden-hued sheaves, With her timid, dark eyes, like a bird through the leaves; While William, who heard, âsotto voce,â exclaimed, Half laughing, half angry, both proud and ashamed: âSo faithful in friendship, so quick at a ruse, There never was servant like my little puss!â PLATE IX. The great magician sat within A chamber filled with fearful sights; O'er many a scull with ghastly grin, Played fitfully the strange blue lights; Misshapen monsters lined the wall, A toad upon his chair did crawl, And many a dark and mystic scrawl Was scattered round the room; Puss trembled by the half-shut door, Scarce seen amid the gloom, Then entered, bowing to the floor, And said, âA man of science, sir, At learning's shrine a worshipper, From distant lands, I lately came, Attracted by your wondrous fame.â Like all the world, by praise beguiled, The great magician bowed and smiled. PLATE X. âThey tell me, sir,â resumed the cat, âWith ease you take this shape or that; Now, though at times, even I have dared To dabble in the magic art, Though witches have my converse shared, And I've defied Death's frequent dart, I own such wonders seem to me, Beyond the power of glamourie.â He scarce had spoke, when o'er him towered A monstrous elephant! He cowered In terror back, but said politely, âSir, if you please, resume your form, I understand the case now rightly, You're rather close, the room is warm!â At once, within his arm-chair, sat The man of magic by the cat. âBravo!â the latter criedââ't is well! But there is still a stranger spell, By which an artist, whom I knew, Could take the smallest shapesâcan you?â And ere the question bold was said, A mouse leaped lightly o'er his head! The cat gave chaseâo'er scull and scroll, O'er books and bones the enchanter stole; He strove the spell-word to recall, That would his spirit disenthrall; In vain; for in that fatal strife, Fear, rage, revenge so wildly raved, They stifled memory's voice; and life Was lost, that but a word had saved; Just as it burned before his vision, Puss caught, and eat, the great magician! PLATE XI. The sunset o'er the palace shone, On glowing glass and fretted stone; The lofty gateway swiftly passed, The prancing horses paused at last. But see! within their fiery eyes What wild, unearthly fears arise? Why start they thus with nostrils wide? What spectre have the steeds espied? From out the gleaming casement, lo! A troop of startled demons go, Who'd met at the magician's call, To revel in his banquet hall! The king, whose heavy mould of clay Had somewhat dimmed the mental ray, Struck by the princely pomp and pride Around, was blind to all beside. The cat comes forth to meet the train: âAnd will you, sire, thus kindly deign To rest within our castle gates? My lord, the marquisâsupper waits!â He gives his paw with easy grace, And leads the princess to her place, While William droops, abashed and shy, And chides him with his speaking eye. 'Tis laden well, the banquet board, The sparkling wine is freely poured; Will quaffs a bumper, leaves his seat, And throws him at the monarch's feet! His cap is doffedâhis rich brown hair Curls round a brow of beauty rare; His dark eyes droop, his face is pale, Whilst to the king he tells his taleâ 'Tis told, and ere the monarch's voice Could bid him tremble or rejoice, The maiden kneels beside him there, And to his story adds her prayer; In vain the king would steel his heart, While thus she pleads with childish art: âAh no! my father, scorn him not! Think of his sad, his lonely lot! Remember, too, that this good youth Hath told you but the simple truth; Look on his young and guileless brow, And if you spurn him hear me vow: Where'er he goes his fate I share, Through danger, suffering, guilt, despair!â Moved by her words the king relents, Forgives poor William, and consents. PLATE XII. Gaily goes the bridal train! Now the abbey gate they gain, In the light the lances gleam, And the royal banners stream; Sound the trumpets as they go, Through the portal winding slow! See in robes young William there, Gracing all the pageant rare! By his side his lady-bride Meets his gaze with love and pride. There the symbols of his might, Sceptre, sword, and taper bright; While the cross is borne behind, Token of a pious mind; And to close the train they bring, In his chair, the stout old king. And who is this with robe of fur, That might become an emperor? Observe how gracefully he greets The crowd that throng the busy streets! Whilst ribbon gay and jewelled star Proclaim his lofty rank afar. 'Tis pussyâmark, how grave he bows, First unto this one, then the other; And turns from William and his spouse, To smile on Jacob and his brother. The people tell how puss's aid The fortune of his master made; And gladly hear the king's decree, That puss prime-minister should be. So all were pleased except poor Tray, Who chanced to come in puss's way; And as our little reader knows That cat and dog are always foes, Puss issued straightway his command, That every dog should leave the land. Thus, as I trust, in pleasing rhymes And pleasing pictures, we have told That wondrous tale of former times, Our grandsires loved to hear of old. Like many another curious story, By Mother Goose or Mother Morey, There is a useful moral to it, Which runs, a thread of silver, through it; 'Tis very wise and very good, And I would tell itâif I could. I hardly think the tale is true, My pretty little dears, do you?</field>
