      <field name="fulltext">To Mr. Samuel Hastings, (Ship-wright of Philadelphia) on his launching the Maryland-Merchant, a large Ship built by him at Annapolis. From the Maryland Gazette, Decemb. 30. Long since I bad the pleasing Muse adieu, More profitable Studies to pursue; But smit with Love of Art, I now again Invoke the Goddess to inspire my Strain. Then do not Hastings, scorn these lowly Lays, Tho' mean, design'd to celebrate thy Praise! Accept this Off'ring of a grateful Heart! And let Good-will excuse my want of Art. Thou wond'rous Architect whose Palaces Bear their Inhabitants o'er deepest Seas, Where, while a longsome, Voyage they pursue, Surprizing Scenes of Wonder greet their View: Attend while I the slow Degrees disclose, By which the Ship-wright to the Skill [illeg.] When Adam's Offspring, in their first Abode On the fam'd Borders of Euphrates Flood, Resolv'd t'explore the River's distant Side, The vent'rous Youth their Floats unweildy guide, And on these Ships they cross'd its foaming Tide. Such cumb'rous Vessels, some nice Artists see With Scorn, and of its Bark disrobe the Tree; Whose fibrous Roots afford the rugged Twine, With which their flight Canooe the closely join: Pleas'd with this great Improvement of their Art, To visit Shores more distant they depart; But soon the Vessel strikes against a Rock, And splits, unable to sustain the Shock: The swimming Passengers the Shore regain, Nor dare to venture on the liquid Plain; 'Till the devouring Fire affords them Aid, And by its Force huge Trees are hollow made, In which the watry Kingdom they pervade. Here unimprov'd thy Art for Ages stood, 'Till the Supreme pour'd our his dreadful Flood, T'entomb Mankind within one gen'ral Grave, Except the Few his Mercy deign'd to save: Then did thy God to bless thy Piety, The Ship-wrights Art, O Noah! teach to Thee, Thy wond'rous Ark, built-by divine Command, Rose slowly underneath thy forming Hand: Finish'd at length, the mighty Work appears, The Labour of an Hundred rolling Years. Within its Womb, the universal Race Of Insects, Beasts, Birds, Men, obtain a Place, Who in due Time should meet a second Birth, And with their Offspring fill the future Earth: The Rest were by the Deluge swept away, While Angels o'er thy Ark their Wings display, Their guiding Hands that Ship with Pleasure steer Which safely does its precious Cargo bear O'er highest Hills in wild Disorder hurl'd, On Seas which overwhelm'd the shatter'd World. Till God's Command fulfill'd, the Floods decay, And lofty Ararat beholds the Day; Upon whose cloudy Top the Vessel moors, Which to instruct the Ship-wright Heav'n secures This the Phankians first with Wonder view, And careful from its Form their Models drew, Their heavy Ships around the neighb'ring Shores, Creep slowly by the Help of num'rous Oars; 'Till DÅdalus, Inventor of the Sails, In Canvas Prisons bound the flying Gales: And taught his Vessel by their Aid to fly Swift as the Birds that range the spacious Sky: These were the Wings from whence he gain'd his Fame, These to remotest Climes convey'd his Name. When proud Sesostris with resistless Sway Made half the groaning World his Laws obey, Brave Jason, Leader of the glorious Host, Who greatly strove to gain their Freedom lost, In the fam'd Argo did the Seas explore, (A golden Ram, upon her Stern she bore,) And leagu'd with num'rous Kings to break th' Ãgyptians Pow'r Sesostris Doom the united Kings decree, And soon regain'd their native Liberty. Thus did a Ship preserve the Race of Man, And by a Ship the Greeks their Freedom gain: To Ships, we owe our Knowledge, and our Trade, By them defend our own, and other Realms invade. Without their Aid, America had been To all, except its Natives, now unseen: Her Trees whose stately Tops to Heaven aspire, Had fall'n a Prey to Worms, or fed the Fire, Which now with Pleasure shall forsake their Woods, And fly to distant Lands o're deepest Floods, From hence shall bear the Product of these Shores, And make the Growth of foreign Climates ours: In Ships of them compos'd, Barbadoes yields To us the Product of her fertile Fields. Iberias golden Fruit shall zest our Bowls, And Florence send her Wine to chear our Souls. To form our Cloaths shall Britain shear her Sheep, And Indian Curtains screen us when we sleep. What Nature has to Maryland deny'd, She might by Ships from all the World provide. Thus have I strove, my Friend, to sing the Praise Of thy nice Art, which claims more lofty Lays. In Thought thy finish'd Vessel oft I view'd As on her growing Bulk I gazing stood; But she out does the Image of my blind, Unthought of Beauties in her Form I find. Of num'rous Hands the Toil of two long Years, Whose Sickness oft has fill'd thy Heart with Cares: How many Obstacles have clogg'd her Way, But now thy Work shall find no more Delay; For see 'tis doneâLo there the Fabrick stands That shall convey thy Fame to distant Lands! Where e'er urg'd on by winged Winds she flies, To Southern Shores, or under Northern Skies; Where grateful Odours flow from spicy Groves, Or where around the Pole Arcturus moves: Where e'er her prosp'rous Course this Ship shall bend, So far, O Hastings, shall thy Fame extend! Nor thou disdain to listen to my Song, While pleas'd my Numbers I to thee prolong: While I to thee some sacred Truths reveal, Which from the Crowd profane the Gods conceal. Not long ago thy Labours to survey, To thy vast Building I pursu'd my Way; Full orb'd the Moon roll'd o'er the Ã¦thereal Plain, And Silence on the Earth began his Reign: Deep-musing on her lofty Deck I stood, And view'd, well-pleas'd, the gently moving Flood; Whose smiling Surface the Resemblance bore Of those tall Trees that grace the sandy Shore: The floating Forest stretch'd its dusky Shade, And nodding to thy Ship its Homage paid, When to my ravish'd Eyes with vast Delight The Muse appear'd,âquickly she clear'd my Sight, And gave me to behold amidst the Floods, Where lately I beheld the waving Woods, A wond'rous Show;âA Triton first appears, His sounding Shell alarm'd my list'ning Ears. I am, he cries, sent to prepare the Way For Chesapeake, great Ruler of the Bay: He comes!âhe comes!âye Deities ascend From all your Grotts!âYour Father's Words attend! Fair Scorn first appear'd to grace his Court, Pa[illeg.] next did to her King resort; Chester whose Stream o'er ouzy Islands strays; Patapsc[illeg.] crown'd with Yews his Homage pays; And Sassafras, whose Banks with graceful Pride Behold their pleasing Prospects in his Tide: Last Susquabana, vext to meet Delay, O'er rugged Rocks rolls rapid on his Way, Foaming with hast his Ruler to obey. The Father of the Floods began to speak, And all attend the Words of Chesapeake. Behold that stately Pile which greets our Eyes! And shall in distant Lands with sweet Surprize Be seen, while all her graceful Form admire, And eager for her Builder's Name enquire. How boldly regular she Charms the Sight! Her Strength, her Symmetry, affords Delight; What just Proportion shines in every Part! A lovely Master-piece of curious Art! How sweet those horizontal Lines appear! From Keel to Wale how faultless and how fair! Her grosser Part takes the eliptick Form, Proof to the surging Sea and howling Storm; Her Sweep how easy, and her lively Sheer! Unbalasted her Course she safe shall steer! Oh happy S[illeg.], whose soft smiling Wave The lovely Burden shortly shall receive! But happier thou Patu[illeg.], by whose Shores To take her Freight the finish'd Vessel moors. Her Freight, which shall be sent without Delay, For all you Rivers must your Tribute pay: Proud that the Produce of your Shores can be Within her Bosom born upon the Sea. My self shall wait on Neptune, and engage Old Ocean's God his Tempests to asswage, To guide her safely thro' his vast Domain, That she her Port in safety may attain. And thou fair Moon, who rolling now on high Dost with thy radiant Beams illume the Sky! Thou who approaching near to some fix'd Star Shalt to Mankind the Longitude declare, Let him who first this stately Ship design'd, In Recompence that long-sought Secret find; So shall the grateful World proclaim his Name; So shall my Bay exceed all Floods in Fame: Since my fair Streams that happy Region lave, Where the Inventor did his Birth receive. But, Oh ye Floods, remark my sage Advice! And bid the Dwellers on your Banks be wise; Warn themâOh warn them o're it be too late, To save the Remnauts of their small Estate! Tell them, the Factors whom they now employ In Britain's Isle their Interest betray; And when their Makers Ruin they have wrought, They load each other with their mutual Fault: In private, some false Brother they accuse, In publick join to clear him from th' Abuse. First moved by Envy, they his Faults detect, Then basely sway'd by Fear, themselves they contradict To ruin Maryland they now uni[illeg.] In monstrous Leagues of amicable Spight. Yet if my Sons have Courage left to thrive, If they their sinking Staple would revive; Let strictest Bonds some Merchant's Faith secure, Whom from their native Land they may procure; For few, alas! are found to keep their Trust, Unless their Int'rest binds them to be Just: By him assisted, might they hope for Aid, Nor need he learn the Mysteries of Trade: An honest, plain Account of Sales to give, And for his Care just Profits to receive. But if this fails (because to my Regret I see my Country deeply sunk in Debt) Let such who have the Fortune to be Free, Refuse to send their Crops across the Sea; Let them in other Works employ their Hands, Nor with Tobacco vex their fertil Lands; 'Till they've enjoy'd a Rest of one short Year, Then Trade shall in a richer Dress appear, And with a higher Price reward the Planter's Care. Here ceas'd the watry Pow'râhis Train descend, And the bright Vision vanish'd, from Your Friend,</field>
