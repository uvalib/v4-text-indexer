      <field name="fulltext">INVOCATION. Oh, Poesy! exquisite gift, Thou art a magnet that shall lift My gold from out the drossy rift. Thou art my soul's refulgent beam My guiding star to ever gleam A flaming pillar in my dream. Thou art my drifting-cloud by day Whose bright pavilion-courts alway Allure me with their fair display. Thou art a Hebe that presents A chalice to my lips, and thence I drain the charmÃ©d, rich contents. Delicious, bubbling nectars twine Their trickling tendrils as a vine Through all my being; steept in wine And numb to any thought of earth I wrestle with my spirit's mirth In travail with a poem's birth. When chasing cares are wearying With all my life to thee I clingâ Believing I was born to sing. Lo! thou hast taught me where to fly Escaping every ill; for I, Transfigured by thy witchery, As Daphne in the laurel park Seem wholly shut in leafy ark, I feel beneath my rugged bark A nervÃ©d pulse that never cowers; The turgid stream of sap hath powers That shall beget a thousand flowers. I quiver from my very root, I strive to doff my leafy suit And load my boughs with perfect fruitâ And lift my gnarled limbs to theeâ I writhe and struggle to be free Endowed with thy divinity. Thou art my fast and feast; and true Thou art my sweetest twilight-dew, That grants me purer life anew. And as the flower unto the moon Returns its hoarded sweets full soon, I yield thee all, in verse and tune. Of Nature. THE GUTTERâA CITY IDYL. You are welcome, dusky cloud, With your bosom swelling; And your tearsâtheir patter cheers All my dusty dwelling: And the gutter sudden wakes In a thousand voices; O, the song that rings along Where the rill rejoices! I am happy for the sight, Joining your carouses, Brook and I go laughing by All the dripping houses. You'll excuse us for the noise, And our haste and flurry? We must fly, for soon we die, That is why we hurry. I am here because I like Just this sort of weather; Brook takes me for companyâ Down we go together. Ha! this life's a merry one, Though a thoughtless scorner Cries, âThe tomb is full of gloom, Down upon the corner.â What if all its life is briefâ Born of such a showerâ Running through a block or two, Dying in an hour? There is something still beyondâ Death is nothing surerâ Brook will flow, and ever grow Softer, sweeter, purer, Till the sun doth draw it hence, T'wards its quenchless taper; It will rise into the skies As a silver vapor. As it floateth in the airâ Merciful its slumberâ Then again is born the rain Of that cloud of umber. But the brook is growing stillâ Is the rain abating! In a breath will sudden death Take it at the grating. You would hardly know it now For its faintest mutterâ A shriveled tongue that laps among The cobbles in the gutter. VESPERS. The poppies nod their sleepy brows, And reel adown the opiate air; The somber lilies slowly rouse, And fold transparent hands in prayer. The climbing roses whisper soft Sweet messages; the four-o'clocks Are drowsy nowâbut far aloft I see the watchmen-hollyhocks. The Moslem-lilacs seem to call On âAllahâ through the red sunset; They rise upon the turret-wall Of every leafy minaret. The stately tulips at this hour Forget their pride. With good intent The haughty dahlias yield their dowerâ The dusky peony-queens relent. A thousand lights are swung in view From heaven's dome. I leave the fair Meek violets kneeling in the dew; It is the evening hour of prayer. DUSK. Smoldering in heat Beyond the blue hill, His mission complete, At the Deity's feet, When the evening is still, The Sun, prone and lowly, At Angelus kneeling; But partly revealing, Yet not hiding wholly A shrine and Christ crucified, Borne aloft tenderly, With lovers side by side Telling a rosary. In the violet East, All dripping with dew, Above the long, high, Purple mountains, that lie By the vail of the night And the valley of dreams, Half dark and half light, With a flood of bright beams, The moon steals in view. The murmur has ceased In the field and the forest; The bee and the bird No longer are heard; The flocks are not bleating; My cares that were sorestâ My pains that were fleeting, Are gone, or at rest; As blessings entreating, I linger repeating My âAve Mariaââso happy, so blest, With cross on my forehead and cross on my breast. THE BUTTERFLY. Thou little beauty, wafted by Upon the summer's gentle sigh; What art thou? Tell me, pray! A sunbeam wandering from the sky, That earthward found its way? A gorgeous flower, too rudely blown? A beautiful bright birdling, flown From some enchanted coastâ A winged mosaic, that hath known More art than man can boast? Spring's sudden flying brought to view Thy form, among the moss that grew Along the garden wall; I saw thee as thou didst renew The fleeces of thy pall. And from the homely commonplace Of thy crude life I now can trace Thy fair and wondrous powers; I learn the secret of the grace That brightens my dull hours. When folded in the noiseless gloomâ Lo! the shut portals of thy room At last were opened wideâ Sunlight had cleft the sealÃ©d tomb Where beauty did abide. May not the homely thought we find Among the rudest of our kind Yet serve an end complete, If chance it be but choicely lined, As was thy winding sheet? For so a poem will forsake Its little hiding cell, to wake In life's delicious pain, When sunshine of the heart shall break The chrysalis of the brain. IN THE DESERT. I. BEDOUIN IN AMBUSH. Seven hawks, in dismal disarray, Across a sky of slaty gray, Now dusking with the dusking day. The sun low down, and almost hid Beneath a vapory, dull lid, Over against a pyramid. One cluster of incessant green, Three slender palms that tower and leanâ A crouching sentinel between. No hissing breath upon the lipâ No stir in poised knee and hipâ No quiver from the finger tip; But, pointing from the fatal lair, The lithe wrist glued about the bare, Dull-gleaming rifle's livid glare. And slow, with wearisome slow limb, A caravan approaching him With fringe of shadows long and slim. II. BEDOUIN ABROAD. A sky of glimmering, cool steel, But barely serving to reveal The desert where the camels kneel. An awkward buzzard on the wing; Above one star in filmy ring; While lower ranks are hovering By pots of delicate, spiced flesh; Abundant fruits in silken mesh; And jars of oil, and olives fresh; And costly vestments of the Kahn, Despoiled with bloody mare and manâ The remnants of a caravan. Against the sky-rim, silvery, One motionless, tall cocoa-tree; The pyramids in angles three. And yonder, where the morning lowers, The fleet-winged flying-horseman scours T'ward Ghizeh and her shining towers. Idyllic and Legendary. SUMMER EXODUS. Turns Summer hence her queenly feet, That early spring the daffodils To kiss, and martial grasses greet, While every flower a tear distills. I cross the stubble fields, all sweet With shining stalks; a longing fills My heart, to warble and repeat The robin in his liquid trills. I am, too, happy when I meet The meadow, where the mountain spills, So lithe and musical and fleet, Its limpid tress of brawling rills; But stay my solitary beatâ And start, as sudden odor thrills My brain, of spice and tropic heatâ Lo! Autumn on her brazen hills. AT ANCHOR. A sailor by the green home shore, When seas are ebbing from his view, Doth all his early joys renew: He sings the songs he sang of yore; He spies his little cot, he smiles With a full joy ne'er felt beforeâ He holds that one bare prospect more Than all the summer of the isles. The quiet home is his; the trees Sprang from the seeds his grandsires laid Among the mold; within the glade The myrtles rustle in the breeze. Above a treasured little grave, His early lost, his first deep woe! Not any land that he may know Beyond the purple of the wave Hath such a jewel in its breast. He loves each rock and stream and dell; 'Tis only here he cares to dwell, 'Tis ever here he longs to rest. This is his home of joy and ease: And better is the myrtle tomb Than all the heavy dusks that gloom The groves of spice beyond the seas. SINGING SHELLS. Long ago! long ago! 'Twas Orpheus caught a pale-pink shell, With deep, dim chambers neatly twined, And pearly lined, and pearly lined, And blew the wind In music through its hollow halls, Till all the Echoes of the shore Cried out with joy, and sought a shell, And caught the faintly lingering tones Of Orpheus' musicâlow as moansâ And drew them in each tiny cell, While rosy walls of all the halls Grew merry then; and quickly fell A murmurous song from every shell. Long ago! long ago! 'Twas Orpheus tuned the shells to voices; And all along the pebbled shore Was music, where was none before, And now each little one rejoices; And every shell a tale doth tell How music came with them to dwell; And all along the pearled shore, Though winds do rave and toss the wave, And bitter spray is on the land, He guards them well, each little shell, Who holds the waters in His hand. So, all along the pearled shore, 'Mid sighing waves, or ocean's roar, They sing, and sing, forevermore. THE TWO CLEOPATRAS. Night is the shadow of that Ethiop queen, With brow as dark as Night, as richly jeweled In barbarous ravishment of luxury; The enchantress of the Cydnus, in her toils Seeking new pleasures, slaying joys with sighs, And drowning mirth with her full tide of tears. Night is the shadow of that Ethiop queen, In rapturous witchery of beatitude; Who drank a hundred pearls, immaculate In their white gloom of glory, and of rare And fabulous richness. Lo! the haughty queen Heaped the all-immeasurable wealth Of treasures rare within a vessel, where, Breathing a mist of filmy radianceâ A seeming vapor woven of gemmy rays, That lurked in nebulous folds about the latent, Limpid, and viewless confines of the vesselâ The copious fund, the teeming store of treasure Was straight dissolved and lost in the crisp bubbling And all-devouring properties of acids. Then, after this accomplished, did she mingle With added juices, spice, and redolence Of various tinctures, a most savory draught. Her folded fingers held the jeweled verge Of the clear goblet, from pure ether hewn, Or some most lucent crystal, delicate, And laid the gleaming halo of the goblet Against the amorous volume of her lips, Where broke the violent fever of her love In turgid crimsoning, deepening the ripe tint O' the silky curtains hung about the proud, Voluptuous tower of her enticing feature. So, staying the hot current of her blood In the drowsy syrup, clotted here and there, And crusted in pearl-ices, glittering pastes, And frosty miracles of rich congealment About the invisible limits of the vessel; Drank she the all incalculable value Of crystalizing dregs, and hurled the cup At a dumb serving slave, a fawning eunuch, Black as hell's border, crouching close along, The swelling curvature of her fair barge Heading the vast armada, as it lay Becalmed among the silver of the Cyndus. The dense aroma of their several freights Had quite embalmed the zephyr, and they lay Beating the silver bosom of the Cyndus,â Like prisoned birds, with fretful throb of wings, Beating the bosom of the silver Cyndus, Close upon Tarsus, where reveled Anthony. Night is the shadow of that Ethiop queen: She strews the seas with stars innumerableâ The bubbly sea with stars which are as pearls; And when the wave is like to stiffen, or burst Its dusky rind for too great store of rare And gleaming treasure, Night! lo, haughty Night, The very shadow of that Ethiop queen Dips at the borders of the teeming sea And drinks the richness of the winy flood, Leaving the world as empty of the dark And cloudy turbulence of Muscadine As was the crystal chalice that was drained By the proud daring of old Egypt's queen. AT THE SPRING. I knew a cumbrous hill, From whose green breast did daintily distill A throbbing rill. This is the artery, And further on the crystal heart must be, Thought said to me. All other I forsook, To follow every twist and curious nook Of this wild brook. Among deep mosses set, I found the glimmering fount that did beget The rivulet. No other eye had known Its secret, nor ear heard, for it made moan Always alone. I quaffed its waters clear: Its limpid music babbled to mine ear With voice sincere. Then such a silence fell Upon me, mantling me, as where a spell Is wont to dwell. Yet fled I from the place At a rude rustling: and fear gave me chase In my disgrace. 'T was a slim water-snake Slipt like an arrow through the shivering brake, And left no wake. But cleft the placid spring And waved its flaming sword, its forked sting, In a charmed ring. So was the fountain spoiled, Within its lucid walls a devil coiledâ My trust was foiled. Of the Heart. MADRIGAL. A maid is sitting by a brook, The sweetest of sweet creatures: I pass that way with my good book Yet cannot read, nor cease to look Upon her winsome features. Amid the blushes on her cheek Her small, white hand reposes: I am a shepherd, for I seek That wilful lamb, with fleece so sleek, Feeding among the roses! MY LITTLE LOVE. When my little love at purple dusk, Trips out upon the lawn among the flowers, The blushing roses quiver in their musk, Love-smitten through: the feathery, fragrant showers Of snow-white blossoms drift upon the grass, Kissing her whispering footsteps as they pass. When my little love at evening's hush, Goes dancing down the dell with laugh and song, The slumbering echoes waken, and a gush Of silvery voices greet her, and along The dewy clusters of the trailing vines In music mingles, murmurs, and repines. When my little love hath sought her cot To dream of angels, as the stars grow clear I homeward plodâalas! unhappy lotâ Yet turn againâI'd long to tarry nearâ Till slowly wandering, thinking of her still, I meet the blue night coming o'er the hill. SWEETHEART. O! this love of mine! Never artist's dream Was as fair as she: Jetty locks, that seem Glossy as can beâ Night before the day Hath streaked it through with gray. O! this love of mine! Brow as white as sands On a tropic shore; Eyes as deep as seas And darker than before Dawn hath turned them blue; Cheeks of richest hue, Pink as pinkest shell That ever mermaid bore From enchanted lands Home where she did dwell. Sometimes, if I please That she blossom more, Her beauty is so fineâ Rosy as red wine. O! this love of mine! Mouth a ripened fruit, If the maid is mute, Tempting me to sin In delicious greed; If a smile I win, Then with charming speed It is cleft indeed, Showing pearly seed. O! this love of mine! Such a witching curl, Such a cunning chin, Like a single pearl With a dimple in; Parian carvÃ©d throat All of curvÃ©d lines Such as Psyche shows, When she sad reclines In some isle remote Mourning Cupid's boat Fading out of view; Is the picture true? Then her bosom's snow In twin drifts, but hush!â All that I have shown Could not bid her blush: If you are a maid, Since never was a pair, Quite too much is said Unless you are as fair; If you are a man, Mate her if you can! Of Fancy and Imagination. CHERRIES AND GRAPES. Not the cherries' nerveless flesh, However fair, however fresh, May ever hope my love to win For Ethiop blood and satin skin. Their luster rich and deep their dye; Yet under all their splendors lieâ That which I cannot tribute grantâ Their hateful hearts of adamant. I love the amber globes that hold That dead-delicious wine of gold; A thousand torrid suns distill Such liquors as these flagons fill. Yet tropic gales with souls of musk Should steep my grapes in steams of dusk: And orient Eden nothing lacks To spice their purple silken sacks. THE WOODPECKER. A busy woodpecker! What would you call This monk of a fellow, tapping a tree With little cells like a catacombed hall, To bury his acorns inâwhat would you call Such a curious monk as he? Tucking his acorns away in their tomb To feed upon, by and by, at his willâ Does he ever think of the hidden bloom In the acorn's heart? Though shut in a tomb There is life cherished there still. Time is a woodpecker, crowding the cells Of the catacombed earth with holy dead; But there 's a bud of life that swells In the oak tree's might and it shatters the cells As the soul when the life has fled. NIGHT SONG. Was it a corse embalmed in state? Was it a princess pale in death, White in her bridal vail? All of the roses held their breath And the dews fell very early and late, I thought that they never would failâ While the night went out and the morn came in, And the drowsy world awoke with a din, And the fading stars fled with a wail. Never a corse in its bleachen shroud, Never the daughter of a queen Under sarcophagus bars; But the fairest face that ever was seen, Hid i' the misty hem of a cloudâ Softly the night wind jars The nebulous texture asunder, and soon The angel of midnight bore the moon Over a flood of stars. MARS. Now Mars steals over the water; He is marching down from the skyâ Great Mars with his golden helmet And the golden flame in his eye. The sea is still, for the ripples Are hushed at the god's slow tread; And a line of light is trailing The wave like a burning thread. Sad Mars! he is wearied with marching, And wandering off is he, While he nods his yellow helmet And thrusts his lance in the sea. Faltering Mars! with his marching Wearied he seems to be; While he tips his helmet and merges His golden lance in the sea. THE COMET. Was it a star, Or was it a pearl, Loosed with a jar From its setting I' the coronet moon, And begetting, As it fell with a whirlâ Whirling farâ A splendor that faded too soon? Was it a dream Of some splendid star born, That glowed with a gleam And a quiver That startled the night? Like a river That flowed to the morn It did seem, In its luminous, lustrous light. Was it a gem Transfixed with a ray From the burning, bright hem Of the wondrous, Terrible sun, or the moon? Over us, under us, Nor night, no, nor day Hath its equal, bright gem Fair feather of light, flown too soon. THE ANGEL, THE WINE, AND PEARLS. AN ALLEGORY OF THE YEAR. I. I saw a tiny flask of wine An Angel held, 'twas rare and fine. A little golden round of light, With every dainty picture dight. Upon its sculptured sides I found Both joy and woe, close linked around. I wondered at the goblet fine, The gleaming gold, the little wine. The Angel said; âThis flask I hold Is more to man than simple gold, âOr rosy nectar; here are foundâ Within its fair and golden roundâ âGreat drops of blood that yield a life With every dainty pleasure rife; âNor lacks it woe at times; and here Are stored the secrets of a year. II. âThese pearlsââthe Angel's delicate hand A dozen radiant pearls it spannedâ âAre months, that will the goblet load Until the rim is overflowed: âThe crimson flood is crowded up Until the year's end fills the cup.â And having said, the Angel spilled A single pearl, the inner gild Was deeper buried in the hue Of crimson. Said the Angel: âView! âA pearl is dropped, a time has flown, The secret of a month is known.â Then fell another; others still Close followed this, and this, until The crimson flood rose bubbling upâ Each pearl-drop deeper filled the cupâ And rosily just brimmed the top. But one more pearl was left to drop. III. I looked. Her fingers loosed, it fallsâ The round of golden-gleaming walls Are sunk below the crimson lineâ The buried pearl has spilled the wine. The Angel set the cup aside; I asked: âWhy this?â and quick replied The radiant spirit, reaching up To clasp another ready cup: âEach pearl-month i' the goblet falls, The life-blood climbs the golden walls âUntil the rim is reached, and here Is broke the bubble of the year. âThe gems have run the goblet o'er, The wine is richer for the store: âThe pearls are spilled, the months have flown, The secrets of a year are known.â Of Aspiration and Desire. FAME. She charmed him with her charming eye; To know its luster was to die, Or feed forever on its light. She bore him to her mountain height; With wine-sweet lips she kissed to rest The thousand longings in his breast. She ringed him with her glittering coils; Her flattering words were soft as oils, All swam before his drunken sight; He felt his beauty and his might, And cursed the darkness as he hurled Defiance at the crouching world. He did not know her treachery; But thought her tightened grasp to be The clasp of loveâO! heavy fate! She thrust him in the face of hate With all the venom in her born, And slew him with her tongue of scorn. DESIRE. I would the Fates were busier A shaping out my name and story. It seems not like a haggard Fate To hesitate, and hesitate; But they'll demur if they prefer, And far away is fame and glory. Perhaps delay is profiting, And disappointments shape a moral; But age cares not for sweet applause, For age is wise with âsays and saws.â With merry spring I love to sing And with my youth I seek my laurel. I cannot choose experience To lead me faltering and jaded, While all the blossom of my life Is wasting in the fretful strife, Till reaching hence that height intense I find the myrtle plucked or faded. No wreath of honor dignifies The silver hairs, nor all endeavor Finds any mark of royalty However rich the trophy be. Now I would rise and seize the prize, Then rest forever and forever. COMPENSATION. What if my tender roots may haply coil In a deep mellow soil, Wherein is found no weed That killeth all things with its harmful greed, But only there is nourished mine own reedâ To rear its slender crest In every hue of richest blossom dressed? If in the sunny mazes of my leaves The crafty spider weavesâ Or in my fairest bloom Some worm hath stole, where in delicious gloom It lies and fattens in its honeyed tombâ What shall it profit me, The outward show so fair, the prize I seem to be? Still, I may 'scape the worm, the spider's net; No cursed blight may set Its dangerous touch anew Upon my frailest buds, in vile mildew; My faded flowers the Autumn winds may strew; But, after all the strife, If I have borne no fruit, or seed, what use was life? UNREST. O! vestal lilies, white and still, Thy golden cressets newly trim; O! wine-tipt tulip globes now spill Thy orient oils upon the flame; My heavy woe I may not name, But woe were less if thou wouldst fill Each golden cresset's rimâ For I may burn within the fire All bitterness, but what is true Endures the ordeal of the pyre, And swathes itself in gossamer dew. O! summer wind return again And sing my little ills to rest; Distill thy balm, delightful rain, Through various currents of the air; The cross is heavy that I bear; But thou mayest lull the vexing pain And breathe a quiet in my breast. Peace, weary heart! O! tongue be mute! Voluptuous goddess, prithee, weep Thy golden tears, and soft salute Yon star, my soul desireth sleep. A RHYME OF LIFE. If life be as a flame that death doth kill; Burn little candle lit for me, With a pure spark, that I may rightly see To word my song and utterly God's plan fulfill. If life be as a flower that blooms and dies; Forbid the cunning frost that slays With Judas-kiss, and trusting love betrays: Forever may my song of praise Untainted rise. If life be as a voyage, or foul, or fair: O! bid me not my banners furl For adverse gale, or wave in angry whirl, Till I have found the gates of pearl And anchored there. Of Meditation. SEED-TIME. Grief is a rain, to fall Upon us, one and all, Like needful showers that make the dry earth mellow; For autumn days will comeâ The root of love is numb, Its sweetest blossoms all are sear and yellow. And then a quick regret Will harshly seem to whet The ploughshare of misfortune, while it burrows Along its cruel way; And glossy locks grow gray And lusterless beside the new-turned furrows. Old Time comes on amainâ A farmer with his grain, Experience he sifts between his fingers, As up and down he goes. Search, Time, along the rows; Lest in thy path a weed of evil lingers! His cunning skill is such He seeks with careful touch The seeded groves with softest soil to cover; Yet, Time, thou hast not art, But in some bruisÃ©d heart Long traces of thy husbandry will hover! O, busy husbandman, How perfect is thy plan! Behold the harvest! for thy careful flinging Of little curious seed Shall come a crop indeed; Lo! peace, and trust, and every virtue springing! PENSEROSA. Is it sin to deal with sorrow? Looking upward through our tears, All the breadth of sky is clearer, And twice beautiful; and dearer Seems the coming of the morrow As we wrestle with our fears; Wherefore should we comfort borrow, While the woe may come again? For our little life is brief; And though never joy shall light it, Truly not our tears shall blight it; For the Christ once suffered pain, And He was acquaint with griefâ He, the blessed Christ, did deign Himself to weep. What matter whether Smile or sigh? The fairest bow, Where the sun the spray hath kissed, There it blossoms in the mist Till it withers in fair weather. Beautiful is grief! I know Peace and tears may dwell together. AT POLLOCK'S GRAVE. One seared leaf quivering down From the green choir that wails thy brief renown: This is the poet's crown! Where is thy skillful lute, That could provoke the birds to sweet dispute? Alas! forever mute! The hand that drew the balm Of ravishing music from tuned strings is calm; The worm feeds on thy palm. Not the majestic sweep Of subtle melodies thy nerve could keep From out the dusty heap. The eager sun-rays dart Through silken grasses, searching for thy heart, Of perfect gold a part. The frail vine mantling Thy undeserved nakedness doth cling About thee, perishing. Though no cut altar-stone Is set to tell these ashes are thine own, Thou art not all unknown. Nor dost thou, voiceless, wait; A thousand whispering tongues shall penetrate The Heaven's pearly gate: Singing thine unsung songs, Chanting thy praises out of tuneful throngs, And righting all thy wrongs. I would some song dispense, But falter in my homely utterance, For music is flown hence. âDROWNED! DROWNED!â 'T is said when drowning, snatched from life and lightâ When drowning in sad waters deep and wideâ When drowning, that the waters and the wave Do moan most musically, and singing, sigh In tenderest tones, and witching wild refrains, That enter at the ear and fill the brain With music, quieting; and that the soul Is fraught with harmony, and urged to leave Its transient habitation i' the clay, And seek that far-beyond, we know not of. The body's tenantless sleep is all a-cold; And coming tides slow bear it to the strand, Among the rushes; and the fingers close In icy clasp among the rushes, while The ripples, each in turn, slip up the shore, And kiss the feet, and the close about the hands, And twine the hair among the roots, and trail The long sea-grasses over all the form In slimy ribbons. Then the tides recede And leave the body, pale, and lank, and cold, All in the silence of night, upon the strandâ Sad waters moaning for the still, dead form, The soulless body sleeping on the strand. And after A bleachen skull, outstaring the bold sunâ The mystery of birth, and age, and nameâ The secret of the soul's flight, and the blank And wordless story of a shattered life! The rattling reeds, and the salt-odored sea In tireless wavesâthe hollow autumn wind Tossing among the rushesâand one star Dropping pearl shadows in the empty bowls That held the eyes once in this withered skull! THE SOUTHERN CROSS. Whene'er those southern seas I sail, I find my eyes instinctive turning Where, pure and marvelously pale, Four sacred stars are brightly burning. A star is set above the thorns; Two mark the bleeding palms extended; And one the wounded feet adornsâ In four the potent cross is blended. One only hand had power to place The symbol there, and that immortal; Those fair, celestial fires may grace And beautify the heavenly portal. Whatever danger I may meet Upon the wild, disastrous ocean, Still turn my trusting eyes to greet That flaming cross with true devotion. Nor cease, my willing heart, to give Thy prayers, and every just endeavor; For only by the cross I live, And by the cross I live forever. âDION.â (LYMAN R. GOODMAN.) You sang too early in the spring Of our uncheerful year of song; You felt the bitter chill of wrong, And on a sudden ceased to sing. And on a sudden sang no more In skillful measure to our needs; But there is One who ever heeds Your numbers on the farther shore. I picture you as one who lies Among the palms, with harp and crown. A silver, quivering thread, let down From crystal walls of Paradise, Is the sweet echo of your voice That thrills me. In your vineyard's throng I taste your purple grapes of song, And in their honey-blood rejoice. IN MEMORIAM. L. C. B. OB. MDCCCLXIV. Ãt. XXVI. Only now the chrysalis; Only now the mortal clay, Cold and breathless, utterly. What may wake him? Not a kiss On the purest brow I know, O! so pallid; not a kiss On the listless, closed eyes; They can look beyond the skies At the white throne. Not a kiss On the hollow cheek of snow. What shall wake him? Not a kiss On the bloodless, sealed lips, For an angel's finger-tips Ever-silence there have prest; And the quiet of his breast Is a holy sepulcher; And the sleeping Christ within, Is his heart immaculate, Purged of every blight and sin. Death the ashes did inter With the odor and the balm, Nourished in the long increase Of the Christ-man's perfect calm, And his soul's eternal peace. Faith and Hope sit at the gate Of the sepulcher, and wait For the dawning judgment day; At the portal while I weep. At the portal while I pray, Kneeling at the silent tombâ Who will break the awful gloom? Who shall wake him from his sleep? Who can roll the stone away? Slumber on and take thy rest; Peace forever will abide With thy memory at my side, Dove-like; and upon my breast Falls thy spirit sanctified! Only here the chrysalis, Only here the mortal clay, Cold and breathless utterly. Naught may wake him; not a kiss; Not a kiss or prayer for aye Shall recall him out of bliss! Only here the chrysalis, With the spirit flown away!</field>
