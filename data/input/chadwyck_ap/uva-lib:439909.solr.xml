      <field name="fulltext">EARLY POEMS LYRICS 1845–1851 THE HARP: AN ODE I When bleak winds through the Northern pines were sweeping, Some hero-skald, reclining on the sand, Attuned it first, the chords harmonious keeping With murmuring forest and with moaning strand: And when, at night, the horns of mead foamed over, And torches flared around the wassail board, It breathed no song of maid, nor sigh of lover, It rang aloud the triumphs of the sword! It mocked the thunders of the ice-ribbed ocean, With clenched hands beating back the dragon's prow; It gave Berserker arms their battle motion, And swelled the red veins on the Viking's brow! II No myrtle, plucked in dalliance, ever sheathed it, To melt the savage ardor of its flow; The only gauds wherewith its lord enwreathed it, The lusty fir and Druid mistletoe. Thus bound, it kept the old, accustomed cadence, Whether it pealed through slumberous ilex bowers In stormy wooing of Byzantine maidens, Or shook Trinacria's languid lap of flowers; Whether Genseric's conquering march it chanted, Till cloudy Atlas rang with Gothic staves, Or where gray Calpè's pillared feet are planted, Died grandly out upon the unknown waves! III Not unto Scania's bards alone belonging, The craft that loosed its tongues of changing sound, For Ossian played, and ghosts of heroes, thronging, Leaned on their spears above the misty mound. The Cambrian eagle, round his eyrie winging, Heard the wild chant through mountain-passes rolled, When bearded throats chimed in with mighty singing, And monarchs listened, in their torques of gold: Its dreary wail, blent with the seamews' clangor, Surged round the lonely keep of Penmaen-Mawr; It pealed aloud, in battle's glorious anger, Behind the banner of the Blazing Star! IV The strings are silent; who shall dare to wake them, Though later deeds demand their living powers? Silent in other lands, what hand shall make them Leap as of old, to shape the songs of ours? Here, while the sapless bulk of Europe moulders, Springs the rich blood to hero-veins unsealed,— Source of that Will, that on its fearless shoulders Would bear the world's fate lightly as a shield: Here moves a larger life, to grander measures Beneath our sky and through our forests rung; Why sleeps the harp, forgetful of its treasures,— Buried in songs that never yet were sung? V Great, solemn songs, that with majestic sounding Should swell the Nation's heart from sea to sea; Informed with power, with earnest hope abounding And prophecies of triumph yet to be! Songs, by the wild wind for a thousand ages Hummed o'er our central prairies, vast and lone; Glassed by the Northern lakes in crystal pages, And carved by hills on pinnacles of stone; Songs chanted now, where undiscovered fountains Make in the wilderness their babbling home, And through the deep-hewn cañons of the mountains Plunge the cold rivers in perpetual foam! VI Sung but by these: our forests have no voices; Rapt with no loftier strain our rivers roll; Far in the sky, no song-crowned peak rejoices In words that give the silent air a soul. Wake, mighty Harp! and thrill the shores that hearken For the first peal of thine immortal rhyme: Call from the shadows that begin to darken The beaming forms of our heroic time: Sing us of deeds, that on thy strings outsoaring The ancient soul they glorified so long, Shall win the world to hear thy grand restoring, And own thy latest thy sublimest song! 1850. SERAPION Come hither, Child! thou silent, shy Young creature of the glorious eye! Though never yet by ruder air Than father's kiss or mother's prayer Were stirred the tendrils of thy hair, The sadness of a soul that stands Withdrawn from Childhood's frolic bands, A stranger in the land, I trace Upon thy brow's cherubic grace The tender pleadings of thy face, Where other stars than Joy and Hope Have cast thy being's horoscope. For thee, the threshold of the world Is yet with morning dews impearled; The nameless radiance of Birth Imbathes thy atmosphere of Earth, And, like a finer sunshine, swims Round every motion of thy limbs: The sweet, sad wonder and surprise Of waking glimmers in thine eyes, And wiser instinct, purer sense, And gleams of rare intelligence Betray the converse held by thee With the angelic family. Come hither, Boy! For while I press Thy lips' confiding tenderness, Less broad and dark the spaces be Which Life has set 'twixt thee and me. Thy souls white feet shall soon depart On paths I walked with eager heart; God give thee, in His kindly grace, A brighter road, a loftier place! I see thy generous nature flow In boundless trust to friend and foe, And leap, despite of shocks and harms, To clasp the world in loving arms. I see that glorious circle shrink Back to thy feet, at Manhood's brink, Narrowed to one, one image fair, And all its splendor gathered there. The shackles of experience then Sit lightly as on meaner men: In flinty paths thy feet may bleed, Thorns pierce thy flesh, thou shalt not heed, Till when, all panting from the task, Thine arms outspread their right shall ask, Thine arms outspread that right shall fly, The star shall burst, the splendor die! Go, with thy happier brothers play, As heedless and as wild as they; Seek not so soon thy separate way, Thou lamb in Childhood's field astray! Whence camest thou? what angel bore Thee past so many a fairer shore Of guarding love, and guidance mild, To drop thee on this barren wild? Thy soul is lonely as a star, When all its fellows muffled are,— A single star, whose light appears To glimmer through subduing tears. The father who begat thee sees In thee no deeper mysteries Than load his heavy ledger's page, And swell for him thy heritage. A hard, cold man, of punctual face, Renowned in Credit's holy-place, Whose very wrinkles seem arrayed In cunning hieroglyphs of trade,— Whose gravest thought but just unlocks The problems of uncertain stocks,— Whose farthest flights of hope extend From dividend to dividend. Thy mother,—but a mother's name Too sacred is, too sweet for blame. No doubt she loves thee,—loves the shy, Strange beauty of thy glorious eye; Loves the soft mouth, whose drooping line Is silent music; loves to twine Thy silky hair in ringlets trim; To watch thy lightsome play of limb; But, God forgive me! I, who find The soul within that beauty shrined, I love thee more, I know thy worth Better, than she who gave thee birth. Are they thy keepers? They would thrust The priceless jewel in the dust; Would tarnish in their careless hold The vessel of celestial gold. Who gave them thee? What fortune lent Their hands the delicate instrument, Which finer hands might teach to hymn The harmonies of Seraphim, Which they shall make discordant soon, The sweet bells jangled, out of tune? Mine eyes are dim: I cannot see The purposes of Destiny, But than my love Heaven could not shine More lovingly, if thou wert mine! Rest then securely on my heart: Give me thy trust: my child thou art, And I shall lead thee through the years To Hopes and Passions, Loves and Fears, Till, following up Life's endless plan A strong and self-dependent Man, I see thee stand and strive with men: Thy Father now, thy Brother then. 1851. “MOAN, YE WILD WINDS!” Moan, ye wild winds! around the pane, And fall, thou drear December rain! Fill with your gusts the sullen day, Tear the last clinging leaves away! Reckless as yonder naked tree, No blast of yours can trouble me. Give me your chill and stern embrace, And pour your baptism on my face, Sound in mine ears the airy moan That sweeps in desolate monotone, Where on the unsheltered hill-top beat The marches of your homeless feet. Moan on, ye winds! and pour, thou rain! Your stormy sobs and tears are vain, If shed for her whose fading eyes Will open soon on Paradise: The eye of Heaven shall blinded be, Or ere ye cease, if shed for me. 1850. TAURUS I The Scorpion's stars crawl down behind the sun, And when he drops below the verge of day, The glittering fangs, their fervid courses run, Cling to his skirts and follow him away. Then, ere the heels of flying Capricorn Have touched the western mountain's darkening rim, I mark, stern Taurus, through the twilight gray The glinting of thy horn, And sullen front, uprising large and dim, Bent to the starry hunter's sword, at bay. II Thy hoofs, unwilling, climb the sphery vault; Thy red eye trembles with an angry glare, When the hounds follow, and in fierce assault Bay through the fringes of the lion's hair. The stars that once were mortal in their love, And by their love are made immortal now, Cluster like golden bees upon thy mane, When thou, possessed with Jove, Bore sweet Europa's garlands on thy brow, And stole her from the green Sicilian plain. III Type of the stubborn force that will not bend To loftier art,—soul of defiant breath That blindly stands and battles to the end, Nerving resistance with the throes of death,— Majestic Taurus! when thy wrathful eye Flamed brightest, and thy hoofs a moment stayed Their march at Night's meridian, I was born: But in the western sky, Like sweet Europa, Love's fair star delayed, To hang her garland on thy silver horn. IV Thou giv'st that temper of enduring mould, That slights the wayward bent of Destiny,— Such as sent forth the shaggy Jarls of old To launch their dragons on the unknown sea: Such as keep strong the sinews of the sword, The proud, hot blood of battle,—welcome made The headsman's axe, the rack, the martyr-fire, The ignominious cord, When but to yield, had pomps and honors laid On heads that moulder in ignoble mire. V Night is the summer when the soul grows ripe With Life's full harvest: of her myriad suns, Thou dost not gild the quiet herdsman's pipe, Nor royal state, that royal actions shuns. But in the noontide of thy ruddy stars Thrive strength, and daring, and the blood whence springs The Heraclidean seed of heroes; then Were sundered Gaza's bars; Then, 'mid the smitten Hydra's loosened rings, His slayer rested, in the Lernean fen. VI Thine is the subtle element that turns To fearless act the impulse of the hour,— The secret fire, whose flash electric burns To every source of passion and of power. Therefore I hail thee, on thy glittering track: Therefore I watch thee, when the night grows dark, Slow-rising, front Orion's sword along The starry zodiac, And from thy mystic beam demand a spark To warm my soul with more heroic song. California, 1849. AUTUMNAL VESPERS The clarion Wind, that blew so loud at morn, Whirling a thousand leaves from every bough Of the purple woods, has not a whisper now; Hushed on the uplands is the huntsman's horn, And huskers whistling round the tented corn: The snug warm cricket lets his clock run down, Scared by the chill, sad hour that makes forlorn The Autumn's gold and brown. The light is dying out on field and wold; The life is dying in the leaves and grass. The World's last breath no longer dims the glass Of waning sunset, yellow, pale, and cold. His genial pulse, which Summer made so bold, Has ceased. Haste, Night, and spread thy decent pall! The silent, stiffening Frost makes havoc: fold The darkness over all! The light is dying out o'er all the land, And in my heart the light is dying. She, My life's best life, is fading silently From Earth, from me, and from the dreams we planned, Since first Love led us with his beaming hand From hope to hope, yet kept his crown in store. The light is dying out o'er all the land: To me it comes no more. The blossom of my heart, she shrinks away, Stricken with deadly blight: more wan and weak Her love replies in blanching lip and cheek, And gentler in her dear eyes, day by day. God, in Thy mercy, bid the arm delay, Which through her being smites to dust my own! Thou gav'st the seed thy sun and showers; why slay The blossoms yet unblown? In vain,—in vain! God will not bid the Spring Replace with sudden green the Autumn's gold; And as the night-mists, gathering damp and cold, Strike up the vales where watercourses sing, Death's mists shall strike along her veins, and cling Thenceforth forever round her glorious frame: For all her radiant presence, May shall bring A memory and a name. What know the woods, that soon shall be so stark? What know the barren fields, the songless air, Locked in benumbing cold, of blooms more fair In mornings ushered by the April lark? Weak solace this, which grief will never hark; Blind as a bud in stiff December's mail, To lift her look beyond the frozen dark No memory can avail. I never knew the autumnal eves could wear, With all their pomp, so drear a hue of Death; I never knew their still and solemn breath Could rob the breaking heart of strength to bear, Feeding the blank submission of despair. Yet, peace, sad soul! reproach and pity shine Suffused through starry tears: bend thou in prayer, Rebuked by Love divine. Our life is scarce the twinkle of a star In God's eternal day. Obscure and dim With mortal clouds, it yet may beam for Him, And darkened here, shine fair to spheres afar. I will be patient, lest my sorrow bar His grace and blessing, and I fall supine: In my own hands my want and weakness are,— My strength, O God! in Thine 1850. ODE TO SHELLEY I Why art thou dead? Upon the hills once more The golden mist of waning Autumn lies; The slow-pulsed billows wash along the shore, And phantom isles are floating in the skies. They wait for thee: a spirit in the sand Hushes, expectant for thy coming tread; The light wind pants to lift thy trembling hair; Inward, the silent land Lies with its mournful woods;—why art thou dead, When Earth demands that thou shalt call her fair? II Why art thou dead? I too demand thy song, To speak the language yet denied to mine, Twin-doomed with thee, to feel the scorn of Wrong, To worship Beauty as a thing divine! Thou art afar: wilt thou not soon return To tell me that which thou hast never told? To clasp my throbbing hand, and, by the shore Or dewy mountain-fern, Pour out thy heart as to a friend of old, Touched with a twilight sadness? Nevermore. III I could have told thee all the sylvan joy Of trackless woods; the meadows far apart, Within whose fragrant grass, a lonely boy, I thought of God; the trumpet at my heart, When on bleak mountains roared the midnight storm, And I was bathed in lightning, broad and grand: Oh, more than all, with soft and reverent breath And forehead flushing warm, I would have led thee through the summer land Of early Love, and past my dreams of Death! IV In thee, Immortal Brother! had I found That Voice of Earth, that fails my feebler lines: The awful speech of Rome's sepulchral ground; The dusky hymn of Vallombrosa's pines! From thee the noise of Ocean would have taken A grand defiance round the moveless shores, And vocal grown the Mountain's silent head: Canst thou not yet awaken Beneath the funeral cypress? Earth implores Thy presence for her son;—why art thou dead? V I do but rave: for it is better thus. Were once thy starry nature given to mine, In the one life which would encircle us My voice would melt, my soul be lost in thine. Better to bear the far sublimer pain Of Thought that has not ripened into speech, To hear in silence Truth and Beauty sing Divinely to the brain; For thus the Poet at the last shall reach His own soul's voice, nor crave a brother's string. 1848. SICILIAN WINE I've drunk Sicilia's crimson wine! The blazing vintage pressed From grapes on Etna's breast, What time the mellowing autumn sun did shine: I've drunk the wine! I feel its blood divine Poured on the sluggish tide of mine, Till, kindling slow, Its fountains glow With the light that swims On their trembling brims, And a molten sunrise floods my limbs! What do I here? I 've drunk the wine, And lo! the bright blue heaven is clear Above the ocean's bluer sphere, Seen through the long arcades of pine, Inwoven and arched with vine! The glades are green below; The temple shines afar; Above, old Etna's snow Sparkles with many an icy star: I see the mountain and its marble wall, Where gleaming waters fall And voices call, Singing and calling Like chorals falling Through pearly doors of some Olympian hall, Where Love holds bacchanal. Sicilian wine! Sicilian wine! Summer, and Music, and Song divine Are thine,—all thine! A sweet wind over the roses plays; The wild bee hums at my languid ear; The mute-winged moth serenely strays On the downy atmosphere, Like hovering Sleep, that overweighs My lids with his shadow, yet comes not near. Who 'll share with me this languor? With me the juice of Etna sip? Who press the goblet's lip, Refusing mine the while with love's enchanting anger? Would I were young Adonis now! With what an ardor bold Within my arms I'd fold Fair Aphrodite of Idalian mould, And let the locks that hide her gleaming brow Fall o'er my shoulder as she lay With the fair swell of her immortal breast Upon my bosom pressed, Giving Olympian thrills to its enamored clay! Bacchus and Pan have fled: No heavy Satyr crushes with his tread The verdure of the meadow ground, But in their stead The Nymphs are leading a bewildering round, Vivid and light, as o'er some flowering rise A dance of butterflies, Their tossing hair with slender lilies crowned, And greener ivy than o'erran The brows of Bacchus and the reed of Pan! I faint, I die: The flames expire, That made my blood a lurid fire: Steeped in delicious weariness I lie. Oh lay me in some pearlèd shell, Soft-balanced on the rippling sea, Where sweet, cheek-kissing airs may wave Their fresh wings over me; Let me be wafted with the swell Of Nereid voices: let no billow rave To break the cool green crystal of the sea. For I will wander free Past the blue islands and the fading shores, To Calpè and the far Azores, And still beyond, and wide away, Beneath the dazzling wings of tropic day, Where, on unruffled seas, Sleep the green isles of the Hesperides. The Triton's trumpet calls: I hear, I wake, I rise: The sound peals up the skies And mellowed Echo falls In answer back from Heaven's cerulean walls. Give me the lyre that Orpheus played upon, Or bright Hyperion,— Nay, rather come, thou of the mighty bow, Come thou below, Leaving thy steeds unharnessed go! Sing as thou wilt, my voice shall dare to follow, And I will sun me in thine awful glow, Divine Apollo! Then thou thy lute shalt twine With Bacchic tendrils of the glorious vine That gave Sicilian wine: And henceforth when the breezes run Over its clusters, ripening in the sun, The leaves shall still be playing, Unto thy lute its melody repaying, And I, that quaff, shall evermore be free To mount thy car and ride the heavens with thee! 1848. STORM-LINES When the rains of November are dark on the hills, and the pine-trees incessantly roar To the sound of the wind-beaten crags, and the floods that in foam through their black channels pour: When the breaker-lined coast stretches dimly afar through the desolate waste of the gale, And the clang of the sea-gull at nightfall is heard from the deep, like a mariner's wail: When the gray sky drops low, and the forest is bare, and the laborer is housed from the storm, And the world is a blank, save the light of his home through the gust shining redly and warm:— Go thou forth, if the brim of thy heart with its tropical fulness of life overflow,— If the sun of thy bliss in the zenith is hung, nor a shadow reminds thee of woe! Leave the home of thy love; leave thy labors of fame; in the rain and the darkness go forth, When the cold winds unpausingly wail as they drive from the cheerless expanse of the North. Thou shalt turn from the cup that was mantling before; thou shalt hear the eternal despair Of the hearts that endured and were broken at last, from the hills and the sea and the air! Thou shalt hear how the Earth, the maternal, laments for the children she nurtured with tears,— How the forest but deepens its wail and the breakers their roar, with the march of the years! Then the gleam of thy hearth-fire shall dwindle away, and the lips of thy loved ones be still; And thy soul shall lament in the moan of the storm, sounding wide on the shelterless hill. All the woes of existence shall stand at thy heart, and the sad eyes of myriads implore, In the darkness and storm of their being, the ray, streaming out through thy radiant door. Look again: how that star of thy Paradise dims, through the warm tears, unwittingly shed;— Thou art man, and a sorrow so bitterly wrung never fell on the dust of the Dead! Let the rain of the midnight beat cold on thy cheek, and the proud pulses chill in thy frame, Till the love of thy bosom is grateful and sad, and thou turn'st from the mockery of Fame! Take with humble acceptance the gifts of thy life; let thy joy touch the fountain of tears; For the soul of the Earth, in endurance and pain, gathers promise of happier years! 1849. THE TWO VISIONS Through days of toil, through nightly fears, A vision blessed my heart for years; And so secure its features grew, My heart believed the blessing true. I saw her there, a household dove, In consummated peace of love, And sweeter joy and saintlier grace Breathed o'er the beauty of her face: The joy and grace of love at rest, The fireside music of the breast, When vain desires and restless schemes Sleep, pillowed on our early dreams. Nor her alone: beside her stood, In gentler types, our love renewed; Our separate beings one, in Birth,— The darling miracles of Earth. The mother's smile, the children's kiss, And home's serene, abounding bliss; The fruitage of a life that bore But idle summer blooms before: Such was the vision, far and sweet, That, still beyond Time's lagging feet, Lay glimmering in my heart for years, Dim with the mist of happy tears. That vision died, in drops of woe, In blotting drops, dissolving slow: Now, toiling day and sorrowing night, Another vision fills my sight. A cold mound in the winter snow; A colder heart at rest below; A life in utter loneness hurled, And darkness over all the world. 1850. STORM SONG The clouds are scudding across the moon, A misty light is on the sea; The wind in the shrouds has a wintry tune, And the foam is flying free. Brothers, a night of terror and gloom Speaks in the cloud and gathering roar; Thank God, He has given us broad sea-room, A thousand miles from shore. Down with the hatches on those who sleep! The wild and whistling deck have we; Good watch, my brothers, to-night we 'll keep, While the tempest is on the sea! Though the rigging shriek in his terrible grip, And the naked spars be snapped away, Lashed to the helm, we 'll drive our ship In the teeth of the whelming spray! Hark! how the surges o'erleap the deck! Hark! how the pitiless tempest raves! Ah, daylight will look upon many a wreck Drifting over the desert waves. Yet, courage, brothers! we trust the wave, With God above us, our guiding chart: So, whether to harbor or ocean-grave, Be it still with a cheery heart! Gulf of Mexico, 1850. SONG I plucked for thee the wilding rose And wore it on my breast, And there, till daylight's dusky close, Its silken cheek was pressed; Its desert breath was sweeter far Than palace-rose could be, Sweeter than all Earth's blossoms are, But that thou gav'st to me. I kissed its leaves, in fond despite Of lips that failed my own, And Love recalled that sacred night His blushing flower was blown. I vowed, no rose should rival mine, Though withered now, and pale, Till those are plucked, whose white buds twine Above thy bridal veil. 1849. THE WAVES I Children are we Of the restless sea, Swelling in anger or sparkling in glee; We follow our race, In shifting chase, Over the boundless ocean-space! Who hath beheld where the race begun? Who shall behold it run? Who shall behold it run? II When the smooth airs keep Their noontide sleep, We dimple the cheek of the dreaming deep; When the rough winds come, From their cloudy home, At the tap of the hurricane's thunder-drum, Deep are the furrows of wrath we plough, Ridging his darkened brow! Ridging his darkened brow! III Over us born, The unclouded Morn Trumpets her joy with the Triton's horn, And sun and star By the thousand are Orbed in our glittering, near and far: And the splendor of Heaven, the pomp of Day, Shine in our laughing spray! Shine in our laughing spray! IV We murmur our spell Over sand and shell; We girdle the reef with a combing swell; And bound in the vice, Of the Arctic ice, We build us a palace of grand device— Walls of crystal and splintered spires, Flashing with diamond fires! Flashing with diamond fires! V In the endless round Of our motion and sound, The fairest dwelling of Beauty is found, And with voice of strange And solemn change, The elements speak in our world-wide range, Harping the terror, the might, the mirth, Sorrows and hopes of Earth! Sorrows and hopes of Earth! 1850. SONG From the bosom of ocean I seek thee, Thou lamp of my spirit afar, As the seaman, adrift in the darkness, Looks up for the beam of his star; And when on the moon-lighted water The spirits of solitude sleep, My soul, in the light of thy beauty, Lies hushed as the waves of the deep. As the shafts of the sunrise are broken Far over the glittering sea, Thou hast dawned on the waves of my dreaming, And each thought has a sparkle of thee, And though, with the white sail distended, I speed from the vanishing shore, Thou wilt give to the silence of ocean The spell of thy beauty the more. Gulf of Mexico, 1850. SONNET TO G. H. B. You comfort me as one that, knowing Fate, Would paint her visage kinder than you deem; You say, my only bliss that is no dream She clouds, but makes not wholly desolate. Ah, Friend! your heart speaks words of little weight To veil that sadder knowledge, learned in song, And 'gainst your solace Grief has made me strong: The Gods are jealous of our low estate; They give not Fame to Love, nor Love to Fame; Power cannot taste the joy the humbler share, Nor holy Beauty breathe in Luxury's air, And all in darkness Genius feeds his flame. We build and build, poor fools! and all the while Some Demon works unseen, and saps the pile. 1850. THE WAYSIDE DREAM The deep and lordly Danube Goes winding far below; I see the white-walled hamlets Amid his vineyards glow, And southward, through the ether, shine The Styrian hills of snow. O'er many a league of landscape Sleeps the warm haze of noon; The wooing winds come freighted With messages of June, And down among the corn and flowers I hear the water's tune. The meadow-lark is singing, As if it still were morn; Within the dark pine-forest The hunter winds his horn, And the cuckoo's shy, complaining note Mocks the maidens in the corn. I watch the cloud-armada Go sailing up the sky, Lulled by the murmuring mountain grass Upon whose bed I lie, And the faint sound of noonday chimes That in the distance die. A warm and drowsy sweetness Is stealing o'er my brain; I see no more the Danube Sweep through his royal plain; I hear no more the peasant girls Singing amid the grain. Soft, silvery wings, a moment Have swept across my brow: Again I hear the water, But its voice is sweeter now, And the mocking-bird and oriole Are singing on the bough; The elm and linden branches Droop close and dark o'erhead, And the foaming forest brooklet Leaps down its rocky bed: Be still, my heart! the seas are passed, The paths of home I tread! The showers of creamy blossoms Are on the linden spray, And down the clover meadow They heap the scented hay, And glad winds toss the forest leaves, All the bright summer day. Old playmates! bid me welcome Amid your brother-band; Give me the old affection,— The glowing grasp of hand! I seek no more the realms of old,— Here is my Fatherland! Come hither, gentle maiden, Who weep'st in tender joy! The rapture of thy presence Repays the world's annoy, And calms the wild and ardent heart Which warms the wandering boy. In many a mountain fastness, By many a river's foam, And through the gorgeous cities, 'T was loneliness to roam; For the sweetest music in my heart Was the olden songs of home. Ah, glen and grove are vanished, And friends have faded now! The balmy Styrian breezes Are blowing on my brow, And sounds again the cuckoo's call From the forest's inmost bough. Fled is that happy vision,— The gates of slumber fold; I rise and journey onward Through valleys green and old, Where the far, white Alps announce the morn, And keep the sunset's gold. Upper Austria, 1845. STEYERMARK In Steyermark,—green Steyermark, The fields are bright and the forests dark,— Bright with the maids that bind the sheaves, Dark with the arches of whispering leaves. Voices and streams and sweet bells chime Over the land, in the harvest-time, And the blithest songs of the finch and lark Are heard in the orchards of Steyermark. In Steyermark,—old Steyermark, The mountain summits are white and stark; The rough winds furrow their trackless snow, But the mirrors of crystal are smooth below; The stormy Danube clasps the wave That downward sweeps with the Drave and Save, And the Euxine is whitened with many a bark, Freighted with ores of Steyermark! In Steyermark,—rough Steyermark, The anvils ring from dawn till dark; The molten streams of the furnace glare, Blurring with crimson the midnight air; The lusty voices of forgemen chord, Chanting the ballad of Siegfried's Sword, While the hammers swung by their arms so stark Strike to the music of Steyermark! In Steyermark,—dear Steyermark, Each heart is light as the morning lark; There men are framed in the manly mould Of their stalwart sires, of the times of old, And the sunny blue of the Styrian sky Grows soft in the timid maiden's eye, When love descends with the twilight dark, In the beechen groves of Steyermark. 1848. TO A BAVARIAN GIRL Thou, Bavaria's brown-eyed daughter, Art a shape of joy, Standing by the Isar's water With thy brother-boy; In thy dream, with idle fingers Threading through his curls, On thy cheek the sun's kiss lingers, Rosiest of girls! Woods of glossy oak are ringing With the echoes bland, While thy generous voice is singing Songs of Fatherland,— Songs, that by the Danube's river Sound on hills of vine, And where waves in green light quiver, Down the rushing Rhine. Life, with all its hues and changes, To thy heart doth lie Like those dreamy Alpine ranges In the southern sky; Where in haze the clefts are hidden, Which the foot should fear, And the crags that fall unbidden Startle not the ear. Where the village maidens gather At the fountain's brim, Or in sunny harvest weather, With the reapers trim; Where the autumn fires are burning On the vintage-hills; Where the mossy wheels are turning In the ancient mills; Where from ruined robber-towers Hangs the ivy's hair, And the crimson foxbell flowers On the crumbling stair:— Everywhere, without thy presence, Would the sunshine fail. Fairest of the maiden peasants! Flower of Isar's vale! Munich, 1845. IN ITALY Dear Lillian, all I wished is won! I sit beneath Italia's sun, Where olive-orchards gleam and quiver Along the banks of Arno's river. Through laurel leaves, the dim green light Falls on my forehead as I write, And the sweet chimes of vesper, ringing, Blend with the contadina's singing. Rich is the soil with Fancy's gold; The stirring memories of old Rise thronging in my haunted vision, And wake my spirit's young ambition. But as the radiant sunsets close Above Val d'Arno's bowers of rose, My soul forgets the olden glory, And deems our love a dearer story. Thy words, in Memory's ear, outchime The music of the Tuscan rhyme; Thou standest here—the gentle-hearted— Amid the shades of bards departed. I see before thee fade away Their garlands of immortal bay, And turn from Petrarch's passion-glances To my own dearer heart-romances. Sad is the opal glow that fires The midnight of the cypress spires, And cold the scented wind that closes The heart of bright Etruscan roses. A single thought of thee effaced The fair Italian dream I chased; For the true clime of song and sun Lies in the heart which mine hath won! Florence, 1845. A BACCHIC ODE Wine,—bring wine! Let the crystal beaker flame and shine, Brimming o'er with the draught divine! The crimson glow Of the lifted cup on my forehead throw, Like the sunset's flush on a field of snow. I love to lave My thirsty lip in the ruddy wave; Freedom bringeth the wine so brave! The world is cold: Sorrow and pain have gloomy hold, Chilling the bosom warm and bold. Doubts and fears Veil the shine of my morning years,— My life's lone rainbow springs from tears. But Eden-gleams Visit my soul in immortal dreams, When the wave of the goblet burns and beams. Not from the Rhine, Not from fields of Burgundian vine, Bring me the bright Olympian wine! Not with a ray Born where the winds of Shiraz play, Or the fiery blood of the bright Tokay. Not where the glee Of Falernian vintage echoes free, Or the Chian gardens gem the sea. But wine,—bring wine, Royally flushed with its growth divine, In the crystal depth of my soul to shine! Whose glow was caught From the warmth which Fancy's summer brought To the vintage-fields in the Land of Thought. Rich and free To my thirsting soul will the goblet be, Poured by the Hebe, Poesy. 1847. A FUNERAL THOUGHT I When the stern Genius, to whose hollow tramp Echo the startled chambers of the soul, Waves his inverted torch o'er that pale camp Where the archangel's final trumpets roll, I would not meet him in the chamber dim, Hushed, and pervaded with a nameless fear, When the breath flutters and the senses swim, And the dread hour is near. II Though Love's dear arms might clasp me fondly then As if to keep the Summoner at bay, And woman's woe and the calm grief of men Hallow at last the chill, unbreathing clay— These are Earth's fetters, and the soul would shrink, Thus bound, from Darkness and the dread Unknown, Stretching its arms from Death's eternal brink, Which it must dare alone. III But in the awful silence of the sky, Upon some mountain summit, yet untrod, Through the blue ether would I climb, to die Afar from mortals and alone with God! To the pure keeping of the stainless air Would I resign my faint and fluttering breath, And with the rapture of an answered prayer Receive the kiss of Death. IV Then to the elements my frame would turn; No worms should riot on my coffined clay, But the cold limbs, from that sepulchral urn, In the slow storms of ages waste away. Loud winds and thunder's diapason high Should be my requiem through the coming time, And the white summit, fading in the sky, My monument sublime. 1847. THE NORSEMAN'S RIDE The frosty fires of Northern starlight Gleamed on the glittering snow, And through the forest's frozen branches The shrieking winds did blow; A floor of blue, translucent marble Kept ocean's pulses still, When, in the depth of dreary midnight, Opened the burial hill. Then while a low and creeping shudder Thrilled upward through the ground, The Norseman came, as armed for battle, In silence from his mound: He, who was mourned in solemn sorrow By many a swordsman bold. And harps that wailed along the ocean, Struck by the Skalds of old. Sudden, a swift and silver shadow Rushed up from out the gloom,— A horse that stamped with hoof impatient, Yet noiseless, on the tomb. “Ha, Surtur! let me hear thy tramping, Thou noblest Northern steed, Whose neigh along the stormy headlands Bade the bold Viking heed!” He mounted: like a north-light streaking The sky with flaming bars, They, on the winds so wildly shrieking, Shot up before the stars, “Is this thy mane, my fearless Surtur, That streams against my breast? Is this thy neck, that curve of moonlight, Which Helva's hand caressed? “No misty breathing strains thy nostril, Thine eye shines blue and cold, Yet, mounting up our airy pathway, I see thy hoofs of gold! Not lighter o'er the springing rainbow Walhalla's gods repair, Than we, in sweeping journey over The bending bridge of air. “Far, far around, star-gleams are sparkling Amid the twilight space; And Earth, that lay so cold and darkling, Has veiled her dusky face. Are those the Nornes that beckon onward To seats at Odin's board, Where nightly by the hands of heroes The foaming mead is poured? “'T is Skuld! her star-eye speaks the glory That waits the warrior's soul, When on its hinge of music opens The gateway of the Pole,— When Odin's warder leads the hero To banquets never done, And Freya's eyes outshine in summer The ever-risen sun. “On! on! the Northern lights are streaming In brightness like the morn, And pealing far amid the vastness, I hear the Gjallarhorn: The heart of starry space is throbbing With songs of minstrels old, And now, on high Walhalla's portal, Gleam Surtur's hoofs of gold!” 1846. THE CONTINENTS I had a vision in that solemn hour, Last of the year sublime, Whose wave sweeps downward, with its dying power Rippling the shores of Time. On the bleak margin of that hoary sea My spirit stood alone, Watching the gleams of phantom History, Which through the darkness shone. Then, when the bell of midnight ghostly hands Tolled for the dead year's doom, I saw the spirits of Earth's ancient lands Stand up amid the gloom! The crownèd deities, whose reign began In the forgotten Past, When first the fresh world gave to sovereign Man Her empires green and vast. First queenly Asia, from the fallen thrones Of twice three thousand years, Came with the woe a grieving goddess owns, Who longs for mortal tears. The dust of ruin to her mantle clung And dimmed her crown of gold, While the majestic sorrows of her tongue From Tyre to Indus rolled: “Mourn with me, sisters, in my realm of woe, Whose only glory streams From its lost childhood, like the arctic glow Which sunless Winter dreams! In the red desert moulders Babylon, And the wild serpent's hiss Echoes in Petra's palaces of stone, And waste Persepolis. “Gone are the deities that ruled enshrined In Elephanta's caves, And Brahma's wailings fill the fragrant wind That ripples Ganges' waves: The ancient gods amid their temples fall, And shapes of some near doom, Trembling and waving on the Future's wall, More fearful make my gloom!” Then, from her seat, amid the palms embowered That shade the lion-land, Swart Africa in dusky aspect towered, The fetters on her hand! Backward she saw, from out her drear eclipse, The mighty Theban years, And the deep anguish of her mournful lips Interpreted her tears. “Woe for my children, whom your gyves have bound Through centuries of toil; The bitter wailings of whose bondage sound From many an alien soil! Leave me but free, though the eternal sand Be all my kingdom now,— Though the rude splendors of barbaric land But mock my crownless brow!” There was a sound, like sudden trumpets blown, A ringing, as of arms, When Europe rose, a stately amazon, Stern in her mailèd charms. She brooded long beneath the weary bars That chafed her soul of flame, And like a seer, who reads the awful stars, Her words prophetic came: “I hear new sounds along the ancient shore, Whose dull old monotone Of tides, that broke on many a system hoar, Moaned through the ages lone: I see a gleaming, like the crimson morn Beneath a stormy sky, And warning throes, which long my breast has borne, Proclaim the struggle nigh.” O radiant-browed, the latest born of Time! How waned thy sisters old, Before the splendors of thine eye sublime, And mien erect and bold! Free, as the winds of thine own forests are, Thy brow beamed lofty cheer, And Day's bright oriflamme, the Morning Star, Flashed on thy lifted spear. “I bear no weight”—rang thine exulting tones— “Of memories weird and vast; No crushing heritage of iron thrones, Bequeathed by some dead Past; But hopes, that give my children power to climb Above the old-world fears— Whose prophecies forerun the latest time, And lead the crowning years! “Like spectral lamps, that burn before a tomb, The ancient lights expire; I hold a torch, that floods the fading gloom With everlasting fire: Crowned with my constellated stars, I stand Beside the foaming sea, And from the Future, with a victor's hand, Claim empire for the Free!” 1848. L'ENVOI I've passed the grim and threatening warders That guard the vestibule of Song, And traced the print of bolder footsteps The lengthened corridors along; Where every thought I strove to blazon Beside the bannered lays of old, Was dim below some bright escutcheon, Or shaded by some grander fold. I saw, in veiled and shadowy glimpses, The solemn halls expand afar, And through the twilight, half despairing, Looked trembling up to find a star; Till, in the rush of wings, awakened My soul to utterance free and strong And with impassioned exultation, I revelled in the rage of Song! Then, though the world beside, unheeding, Heard other voices than my own, Thou, thou didst mark the broken music, And cheer its proud, aspiring tone: Thou cam'st in many a lovely vision To lead my ardent spirit on, Thine eye my morning-star of promise, The sweet anticipant of dawn. And if I look to holier altars, Thou still art near me, as of old, And thou wilt give the living laurel, When the shrined Presence I behold. Take, then, these echoes of thy being, My lips have weakly striven to frame; For when I speak what thou inspirest, I know my songs are nearest fame. 1848. CALIFORNIA BALLADS AND POEMS 1848–1851 MANUELA From the doorway, Manuela, in the sunny April morn, Southward looks, along the valley, over leagues of gleaming corn; Where the mountain's misty rampart like the wall of Eden towers, And the isles of oak are sleeping on a painted sea of flowers. All the air is full of music, for the winter rains are o'er, And the noisy magpies chatter from the budding sycamore; Blithely frisk unnumbered squirrels, over all the grassy slope; Where the airy summits brighten, nimbly leaps the antelope. Gentle eyes of Manuela! tell me wherefore do ye rest On the oak's enchanted islands and the flowery ocean's breast? Tell me wherefore, down the valley, ye have traced the highway's mark Far beyond the belts of timber, to the mountain-shadows dark? Ah, the fragrant bay may blossom and the sprouting verdure shine With the tears of amber dropping from the tassels of the pine, And the morning's breath of balsam lightly brush her sunny cheek,— Little recketh Manuela of the tales of Spring they speak. When the Summer's burning solstice on the mountain-harvests glowed, She had watched a gallant horseman riding down the valley road; Many times she saw him turning, looking back with parting thrills, Till amid her tears she lost him, in the shadow of the hills. Ere the cloudless moons were over, he had passed the Desert's sand, Crossed the rushing Colorado and the wild Apachè Land, And his laden mules were driven, when the time of rains began, With the traders of Chihuahua, to the Fair of San Juan. Therefore watches Manuela,—therefore lightly doth she start, When the sound of distant footsteps seems the beating of her heart; Not a wind the green oak rustles or the redwood branches stirs, But she hears the silver jingle of his ringing bit and spurs. Often, out the hazy distance, come the horsemen, day by day, But they come not as Bernardo,—she can see it, far away; Well she knows the airy gallop of his mettled alazàn, Light as any antelope upon the Hills of Gavilàn. She would know him 'mid a thousand, by his free and gallant air; By the featly-knit sarápè, such as wealthy traders wear; By his broidered calzoneros and his saddle, gayly spread, With its cantle rimmed with silver, and its horn a lion's head. None like him the light riáta on the maddened bull can throw; None amid the mountain-cañons track like him the stealthy doe; And at all the Mission festals, few indeed the revellers are Who can dance with him the jota, touch with him the gay guitar. He has said to Manuela, and the echoes linger still In the cloisters of her bosom, with a secret, tender thrill, When the bay again has blossomed, and the valley stands in corn, Shall the bells of Santa Clara usher in the wedding morn. He has pictured the procession, all in holiday attire, And the laugh of bridal gladness, when they see the distant spire; Then their love shall kindle newly, and the world be doubly fair In the cool, delicious crystal of the summer morning air. Tender eyes of Manuela! what has dimmed your lustrous beam? 'T is a tear that falls to glitter on the casket of her dream. Ah, the eye of Love must brighten, if its watches would be true, For the star is falsely mirrored in the rose's drop of dew! But her eager eyes rekindle, and her breathless bosom thrills, As she sees a horseman moving in the shadow of the hills: Now in love and fond thanksgiving they may loose their pearly tides,— 'T is the alazàn that gallops, 't is Bernardo's self that rides! Gulf of Mexico, 1850. THE FIGHT OF PASO DEL MAR Gusty and raw was the morning, A fog hung over the seas, And its gray skirts, rolling inland, Were torn by the mountain trees; No sound was heard but the dashing Of waves on the sandy bar, When Pablo of San Diego Rode down to the Paso del Mar. The pescadòr, out in his shallop, Gathering his harvest so wide, Sees the dim bulk of the headland Loom over the waste of the tide; He sees, like a white thread, the pathway Wind round on the terrible wall, Where the faint, moving speck of the rider Seems hovering close to its fall. Stout Pablo of San Diego Rode down from the hills behind; With the bells on his gray mule tinkling He sang through the fog and wind. Under his thick, misted eyebrows Twinkled his eye like a star, And fiercer he sang as the sea-winds Drove cold on the Paso del Mar. Now Bernal, the herdsman of Chino, Had travelled the shore since dawn, Leaving the ranches behind him— Good reason had he to be gone! The blood was still red on his dagger, The fury was hot in his brain, And the chill, driving scud of the breakers Beat thick on his forehead in vain. With his poncho wrapped gloomily round him, He mounted the dizzying road, And the chasms and steeps of the headland Were slippery and wet, as he trod: Wild swept the wind of the ocean, Rolling the fog from afar, When near him a mule-bell came tinkling, Midway on the Paso del Mar. “Back!” shouted Bernal, full fiercely, And “Back!” shouted Pablo, in wrath, Is his mule halted, startled and shrinking, On the perilous line of the path. The roar of devouring surges Came up from the breakers' hoarse war; And “Back, or you perish!” cried Bernal, “I turn not on Paso del Mar!” The gray mule stood firm as the headland: He clutched at the jingling rein, When Pablo rose up in his saddle And smote till he dropped it again. A wild oath of passion swore Bernal, And brandished his dagger, still red, While fiercely stout Pablo leaned forward, And fought o'er his trusty mule's head. They fought till the black wall below them Shone red through the misty blast; Stout Pablo then struck, leaning farther, The broad breast of Bernal at last. And, frenzied with pain, the swart hersdman Closed on him with terrible strength, And jerked him, despite of his struggles, Down from the saddle at length. They grappled with desperate madness, On the slippery edge of the wall; They swayed on the brink, and together Reeled out to the rush of the fall. A cry of the wildest death-anguish Rang faint through the mist afar, And the riderless mule went homeward From the fight of the Paso del Mar. 1848. THE PINE FOREST OF MONTEREY What point of Time, unchronicled, and dim As yon gray mist that canopies your heads, Took from the greedy wave and gave the sun Your dwelling-place, ye gaunt and hoary Pines? When, from the barren bosoms of the hills, With scanty nurture, did ye slowly climb, Of these remote and latest-fashioned shores The first-born forest? Titans gnarled and rough, Such as from out subsiding Chaos grew To clothe the cold loins of the savage earth, What fresh commixture of the elements, What earliest thrill of life, the stubborn soil Slow-mastering, engendered ye to give The hills a mantle and the wind a voice? Along the shore ye lift your rugged arms, Blackened with many fires, and with hoarse chant,— Unlike the fibrous lute your co-mates touch In elder regions,—fill the awful stops Between the crashing cataracts of the surf. Have ye no tongue, in all your sea of sound, To syllable the secret,—no still voice To give your airy myths a shadowy form, And make us of lost centuries of lore The rich inheritors? The sea-winds pluck Your mossy beards, and gathering as they sweep, Vex your high heads, and with your sinewy arms Grapple and toil in vain. A deeper roar, Sullen and cold, and rousing into spells Of stormy volume, is your sole reply. Anchored in firm-set rock, ye ride the blast, And from the promontory's utmost verge Make signal o'er the waters. So ye stood, When, like a star, behind the lonely sea, Far shone the white speck of Grijalva's sail; And when, through driving fog, the breaker's sound Frighted Otondo's men, your spicy breath Played as in welcome round their rusty helms, And backward from its staff shook out the folds Of Spain's emblazoned banner. Ancient Pines, Ye bear no record of the years of man. Spring is your sole historian,—Spring, that paints These savage shores with hues of Paradise, That decks your branches with a fresher green, And through your lonely, far cañadas pours Her floods of bloom, rivers of opal dye That wander down to lakes and widening seas Of blossom and of fragrance,—laughing Spring, That with her wanton blood refills your veins, And weds ye to your juicy youth again With a new ring, the while your rifted bark Drops odorous tears. Your knotty fibres yield To the light touch of her unfailing pen, As freely as the lupin's violet cup. Ye keep, close-locked, the memories of her stay As in their shells the avelonès keep Morn's rosy flush and moonlight's pearly glow, The wild northwest, that from Alaska sweeps, To drown Point Lobos with the icy scud And white sea-foam, may rend your boughs and leave Their blasted antlers tossing in the gale; Your steadfast hearts are mailed against the shock, And on their annual tablets naught inscribe Of such rude visitation. Ye are still The simple children of a guiltless soil, And in your natures show the sturdy grain That passion cannot jar, nor force relax, Nor aught but sweet and kindly airs compel To gentler mood. No disappointed heart Has sighed its bitterness beneath your shade; No angry spirit ever came to make Your silence its confessional; no voice, Grown harsh in Crime's great market-place, the world, Tainted with blasphemy your evening hush And aromatic air. The deer alone,— The ambushed hunter that brings down the deer,— The fisher wandering on the misty shore To watch sea-lions wallow in the flood,— The shout, the sound of hoofs that chase and fly, When swift vaqueros, dashing through the herds, Ride down the angry bull,—perchance, the song Some Indian heired of long-forgotten sires,— Disturb your solemn chorus. Stately Pines, But few more years around the promontory Your chant will meet the thunders of the sea. No more, a barrier to the encroaching sand, Against the surf ye 'll stretch defiant arm, Though with its onset and besieging shock Your firm knees tremble. Never more the wind Shall pipe shrill music through your mossy beards, Nor sunset's yellow blaze athwart your heads Crown all the hills with gold. Your race is past: The mystic cycle, whose unnoted birth Coeval was with yours, has run its sands, And other footsteps from these changing shores Frighten its haunting Spirit. Men will come To vex your quiet with the din of toil; The smoky volumes of the forge will stain This pure, sweet air; loud keels will ride the sea, Dashing its glittering sapphire into foam; Through all her green cañadas Spring will seek Her lavish blooms in vain, and clasping ye, O mournful Pines, within her glowing arms, Will weep soft rains to find ye fallen low. Fall, therefore, yielding to the fiat! Fall, Ere the maturing soil, whose first dull life Fed your belated germs, be rent and seamed! Fall, like the chiefs ye sheltered, stern, unbent, Your gray beards hiding memorable scars! The winds will mourn ye, and the barren hills Whose breast ye clothed; and when the pauses come Between the crashing cataracts of the surf, A funeral silence, terrible, profound, Will make sad answer to the listening sea. Monterey, 1849. EL CANELO I Now saddle El Canelo!—the freshening wind of morn, Down in the flowery vega, is stirring through the corn; The thin smoke of the ranches grows red with coming day, And the steed is fiercely stamping, in haste to be away. II My glossy-limbed Canelo, thy neck is curved in pride, Thy slender ears pricked forward, thy nostril straining wide; And as thy quick neigh greets me, and I catch thee by the mane, I 'm off with the winds of morning,—the chieftain of the plain! III I feel the swift air whirring, and see along our track, From the flinty-paved sierra, the sparks go streaming back; And I clutch my rifle closer, as we sweep the dark defile, Where the red guerillas ambush for many a lonely mile. IV They reach not El Canelo; with the swiftness of a dream We 've passed the bleak Nevada, and San Fernando's stream; But where, on sweeping gallop, my bullet backward sped, The keen-eyed mountain vultures will wheel above the dead. V On! on, my brave Canelo! we 've dashed the sand and snow From peaks upholding heaven, from deserts far below,— We 've thundered through the forest, while the crackling branches rang, And trooping elks, affrighted, from lair and covert sprang. VI We 've swum the swollen torrent,—we 've distanced in the race The baying wolves of Pinos, that panted with the chase; And still thy mane streams backward, at every thrilling bound, And still thy measured hoof-stroke beats with its morning sound! VII The seaward winds are wailing through Santa Barbara's pines, And like a sheathless sabre, the far Pacific shines; Hold to thy speed, my arrow! at nightfall thou shalt lave Thy hot and smoking haunches beneath his silver wave! VIII My head upon thy shoulder, along the sloping sand We 'll sleep as trusty brothers, from out the mountain land; The pines will sound in answer to the surges on the shore, And in our dreams, Canelo, we 'll make the journey o'er. 1848. THE SUMMER CAMP Here slacken rein; here let the dusty mules Unsaddled graze! The shadows of the oaks Are on our brows, and through their knotted boles We see the blue round of the boundless plain Vanish in glimmering heat: these aged oaks, The island speck that beckoned us afar Over the burning level,—as we came, Spreading to shore and cape, and bays that ran To leafy headlands, balanced on the haze, Faint and receding as a cloud in air. The mules may roam unsaddled: we will lie Beneath the mighty trees, whose shade like dew Poured from the urns of Twilight, dries the sweat Of sunburnt brows, and on the heavy lid And heated eyeball sheds a balm, than sleep Far sweeter. We have done with travel,—we Are weary now, who never dreamed of Rest, For until now did never Rest unbar Her palace-doors, nor until now our ears The silence drink, beyond all melodies Of all imagined sound, that wraps her realm. Here, where the desolating centuries Have left no mark; where noises never came From the far world of battle and of toil; Where God looks down and sends no thunderbolt To smite a human wrong, for all is good, She finds a refuge. We will dwell with her. No more of travel, where the flaming sword Of the great sun divides the heavens; no more Of climbing over jutty steeps that swim In driving sea-mist, where the stunted tree Slants inland, mimicking the stress of winds When wind is none; of plain and steaming marsh Where the dry bulrush crackles in the heat; Of camps by starlight in the columned vault Of sycamores, and the red, dancing fires That build a leafy arch, efface and build, And sink at last, to let the stars peep through; Of cañons grown with pine and folded deep In golden mountain-sides; of airy sweeps Of mighty landscape, lying all alone Like some deserted world. They tempt no more. It is enough that such things were: too blest, O comrades mine, to lie in Summer's arms, Lodged in her Camp of Rest, we will not dream That they may vex us more. The sun goes down: The dun mules wander idly: motionless Beneath the stars, the heavy foliage lifts Its rich, round masses, silent as a cloud That sleeps at midday on a mountain peak. All through the long, delicious night no stir Is in the leaves; spangled with broken gleams, Before the pining Moon,—that fain would drop Into the lap of this deep quiet,—swerve Eastward the shadows: Day comes on again, Where is the life we led? Whither hath fled The turbulent stream that brought us hither? How, So full of sound, so lately dancing down The mountains, turbid, fretted into foam,— How has it slipped, with scarce a gurgling coil, Into this calm transparence, noise or wind Hath ruffled never? Ages past, perchance, Such wild turmoil was ours, or did some Dream Malign, that last night nestled in the oak, Whisper our ears, when not a star could see? Give o'er the fruitless doubt: we will not waste One thought of rest, nor spill one radiant drop From the full goblet of this summer balm. Day after day the mellow sun slides o'er, Night after night the mellow moon. The clouds Are laid, enchanted: soft and bare, the heavens Fold to their breast the dozing Earth that lies In languor of deep bliss. At times a breath, Remnant of gales far off, forgotten now, Rustles the never-fading leaves, then drops Affrighted into silence. Near a slough Of dark, still water, in the early morn The shy coyotas prowl, or trooping elk From the close covert of the bulrush fields Their dewy antlers toss: nor other sight, Save when the falcon, poised on wheeling wings, His bright eye on the burrowing coney, cuts His arrowy plunge. Along the distant trail, Dim with the heat, sometimes the miners go, Bearded and rough, the swart Sonorians drive Their laden asses, or vaqueros whirl The lasso's coil and carol many a song, Native to Spanish hills. As when we lie On the soft brink of Sleep, not pillowed quite To blest forgetfulness, some dim array Of masking forms in long procession comes, A sweet disturbance to the poppied sense, That will not cease, but gently holds it back From slumber's haven, so their figures pass, With such disturbance cloud the blessèd calm, And hold our beings, ready to slip forth O'er unmolested seas, still rocking near The coasts of Action. Other dreams are ours, Of shocks that were, or seemed; whereof our souls Feel the subsiding lapse, as feels the sand Of tropic island-shores the dying pulse Of storms that racked the Northern sea. My Soul, I do believe that thou hast toiled and striven, And hoped and suffered wrong. I do believe Great aims were thine, deep loves and fiery hates, And though I may have lain a thousand years Beneath these Oaks, the baffled trust of Youth, Thy first keen sorrow, brings a gentle pang To temper joy. Nor will the joy I drank To wild intoxication, quit my heart: It was no dream that still has power to droop The soft-suffusing lid, and lift desire Beyond this rapt repose. No dream, dear love! For thou art with me in our Camp of Peace. O Friend, whose history is writ in deeds That make your life a marvel, come no gleams Of past adventure, echoes of old storms, And Battle's tingling hum of flying shot, To touch your easy blood and tempt you o'er The round of yon blue plain? Or have they lost, Heroic days, the virtue which the heart That did their best rejoicing, proved so high? Back through the long, long cycles of our rest Your memory travels: through this hush you hear The Gila's dashing, feel the yawning jaws Of black volcanic gorges close you in On waste and awful tracts of wilderness, Which other than the eagle's cry, or bleat Of mountain-goat, hear not: the scorching sand Eddies around the tracks your fainting mules Leave in the desert: thorn and cactus pierce Your bleeding limbs, and stiff with raging thirst Your tongue forgets its office. Leave untried That cruel trail, and leave the wintry hills And leave the tossing sea! The Summer here Builds us a tent of everlasting calm. How shall we wholly sink our lives in thee, Thrice-blessèd Deep? O many-natured Soul, Chameleon-like, that, steeped in every phase Of wide existence, tak'st the hue of each, Here with the silent Oaks and azure Air Incorporate grow! Here loosen one by one Thy vexing memories, burdens of the Past, Till all unrest be laid, and strong Desire Sleeps on his nerveless arm. Content to find In liberal Peace thy being's high result And crown of aspiration, gather all The dreams of sense, the reachings of the mind For ampler issues and dominion vain, To fold them on her bosom, happier there Than in exultant action: as a child Forgets his meadow butterflies and flowers, Upon his mother's breast. It may not be. Not in this Camp, in these enchanted Trees, But in ourselves, must lodge the calm we seek, Ere we can fix it here. We cannot take From outward nature power to snap the curse Which clothed our birth; and though 't were easier This hour to die than yield the blessèd cup Wherefrom our hearts divinest comfort draw, It clothes us yet, and yet shall drive us forth To breast the world. Then come: we will not bide To tempt a ruin to this paradise, Fulfilling Destiny. A mighty wind Would gather on the plain, a cloud arise To blot the sky, with thunder in its heart, And the black column of the whirlwind spin Out of the cloud, straight downward to this grove, Take by their heads the shuddering trees, and wrench With fearful clamor, limb from limb, till Rest Should flee forever. Rather set at once Our faces towards the noisy world again, And gird our loins for action. Let us go! 1851. THE BISON TRACK I Strike the tent! the sun has risen; not a vapor streaks the dawn, And the frosted prairie brightens to the westward, far and wan: Prime afresh the trusty rifle,—sharpen well the hunting spear— For the frozen sod is trembling, and a noise of hoofs I hear! II Fiercely stamp the tethered horses, as they snuff the morning's fire; Their impatient heads are tossing, and they neigh with keen desire. Strike the tent! the saddles wait us,—let the bridle-reins be slack, For the prairie's distant thunder has betrayed the bison's track. III See! a dusky line approaches: hark, the onward-surging roar, Like the din of wintry breakers on a sounding wall of shore! Dust and sand behind them whirling, snort the foremost of the van, And their stubborn horns are clashing through the crowded caravan. IV Now the storm is down upon us: let the maddened horses go! We shall ride the living whirlwind, though a hundred leagues it blow! Though the cloudy manes should thicken, and the red eyes' angry glare Lighten round us as we gallop through the sand and rushing air! V Myriad hoofs will scar the prairie, in our wild, resistless race, And a sound, like mighty waters, thunder down the desert space: Yet the rein may not be tightened, nor the rider's eye look back— Death to him whose speed should slacken, on the maddened bison's track! VI Now the trampling herds are threaded, and the chase is close and warm For the giant bull that gallops in the edges of the storm: Swiftly hurl the whizzing lasso,—swing your rifles as we run: See! the dust is red behind him,—shout, my comrades, he is won! VII Look not on him as he staggers,—'t is the last shot he will need! More shall fall, among his fellows, ere we run the mad stampede,— Ere we stem the brinded breakers, while the wolves, a hungry pack, Howl around each grim-eyed carcass, on the bloody Bison Track! 1848. ROMANCES 1849–1851 MON-DA-MIN OR, THE ROMANCE OF MAIZE I Long ere the shores of green America Were touched by men of Norse and Saxon blood, What time the Continent in silence lay, A solemn realm of forest and of flood, Where Nature wantoned wild in zones immense, Unconscious of her own magnificence; II Then to the savage race, who knew no world Beyond the hunter's lodge, the council-fire, The clouds of grosser sense were sometimes furled, And spirits came to answer their desire,— The spirits of the race, grotesque and shy; Exaggerated powers of earth and sky. III For Gods resemble whom they govern: they, The fathers of the soil, may not outgrow The children's vision. In that earlier day, They stooped the race familiarly to know; From Heaven's blue prairies they descended then, And took the shapes and shared the lives of men. IV A chief there was, who in the frequent stress Of want, yet in contentment, lived his days; His lodge was built within the wilderness Of Huron, clasping those transparent bays, Those deeps of unimagined crystal, where The bark canoe seems hung in middle air. V There, from the lake and from the uncertain chase With patient heart his sustenance he drew; And he was glad to see, in that wild place, The sons and daughters that around him grew, Although more scant they made his scanty store, And in the winter moons his need was sore. VI The eldest was a boy, a silent lad, Who wore a look of wisdom from his birth: Such beauty, both of form and face, he had, As until then was never known on earth: And so he was (his soul so bright and far!) Osséo named,—Son of the Evening Star. VII This boy by nature was companionless: His soul drew nurture only when it sucked The savage dugs of Fable; he could guess The knowledge other minds but slowly plucked From out the heart of things; to him, as well As to his Gods, all things were possible. VIII The heroes of that shapeless faith of his Took life from him: when gusts of powdery snow Whirled round the lodge, he saw Paup-puckewiss Floundering amid the drifts, and he would go Climbing the hills, while sunset faded wan, To seek tho feathers of the Rosy Swan. IX He knew the lord of serpent and of beast, The crafty Incarnation of the North; He knew, when airs grew warm and buds increased, The sky was pierced, the Summer issued forth, And when a cloud concealed some mountain's crest The Bird of Thunder brooded on his nest. X Through Huron's mists he saw the enchanted boat Of old Mishosha to his island go, And oft he watched, if on the waves might float, As once, the Fiery Plume of Wassamo; And when the moonrise flooded coast and bay, He climbed the headland, stretching far away; XI For there—so ran the legend—nightly came The small Puck-wudjees, ignorant of harm: The friends of Man, in many a sportive game The nimble elves consoled them for the charm Which kept them exiled from their homes afar,— The silver lodges of a twilight star. XII So grew Osséo, as a lonely pine, That knows the secret of the wandering breeze, And ever sings its canticles divine, Uncomprehended by the other trees: And now the time drew nigh, when he began The solemn fast whose issue proves the man. XIII His father built a lodge the wood within, Where he the appointed space should duly bide, Till such propitious time as he had been By faith prepared, by fasting purified, And in mysterious dreams allowed to see What God the guardian of his life would be. XIV The anxious crisis of the Spring was past, And warmth was master o'er the lingering cold. The alder's catkins dropped; the maple cast His crimson bloom, the willow's downy gold Blew wide, and softer than a squirrel's car The white oak's foxy leaves began appear. XV There was a motion in the soil. A sound Lighter than falling seeds, shook out of flowers, Exhaled where dead leaves, sodden on the ground, Repressed the eager grass; and there for hours Osséo lay, and vainly strove to bring Into his mind the miracle of Spring. XVI The wood-birds knew it, and their voices rang Around his lodge; with many a dart and whir Of saucy joy, the shrewish catbird sang Full-throated, and he heard the king-fisher, Who from his God escaped with rumpled crest, And the white medal hanging on his breast. XVII The aquilegia sprinkled on the rocks A scarlet rain; the yellow violet Sat in the chariot of its leaves; the phlox Held spikes of purple flame in meadows wet, And all the streams with vernal-scented reed Were fringed, and streaky bells of miskodeed. XVIII The boy went musing: What are these, that burst The sod and grow, without the aid of man? What father brought them food? what mother nursed Them in her earthy lodge, till Spring began? They cannot speak; they move but with the air; Yet souls of evil or of good they bear. XIX How are they made, that some with wholesome juice Delight the tongue, and some are charged with death? If spirits them inhabit, they can loose Their shape sometimes, and talk with human breath: Would that in dreams one such would come to me, And thence my teacher and my guardian be! XX So, when more languid with his fast, the boy Kept to his lodge, he pondered much thereon, And other memories gave his mind employ; Memories of winters when the moose were gone,— When tales of Manabozo failed to melt The hunger-pang his pining brothers felt. XXI He thought: The Mighty Spirit knows all things, Is master over all. Could He not choose Design his children food to ease the stings Of hunger, when the lake and wood refuse? If He will bless me with the knowledge, I Will for my brothers fast until I die. XXII Four days were sped since he had tasted meat; Too faint he was to wander any more, When from the open sky, that, blue and sweet, Looked in upon him through the lodge's door, With quiet gladness he beheld a fair Celestial Shape descending through the air. XXIII He fell serenely, as a wingèd seed Detached in summer from the maple bough; His glittering clothes unruffled by the speed, The tufted plumes unshaken on his brow: Bright, wonderful, he came without a sound, And like a burst of sunshine struck the ground. XXIV So light he stood, so tall and straight of limb, So fair the heavenly freshness of his face, With beating heart Osséo looked at him, For now a God had visited the place. More brave a God his dreams had never seen: The stranger's garments were a shining green. XXV Sheathing his limbs in many a stately fold, That, parting on his breast, allowed the eye To note beneath, his vest of scaly gold, Whereon the drops of slaughter, scarcely dry, Disclosed their blushing stain: his shoulders fair Gave to the wind long tufts of silky hair. XXVI The plumy crest, that high and beautiful Above his head its branching tassels hung, Shook down a golden dust, while, fixing full His eyes upon the boy, he loosed his tongue. Deep in his soul Osséo did rejoice To hear the reedy music of his voice: XXVII “By the Great Spirit I am hither sent, He knows the wishes whereupon you feed,— The soul, that, on your brothers' good intent, Would sink ambition to relieve their need: This thing is grateful to the Master's eye, Nor will His wisdom what you seek deny. XXVIII “But blessings are not free; they do not fall In listless hands; by toil the soul must prove Its steadfast purpose master over all, Before their wings in pomp of coming move: Here, wrestling with me, must you overcome, In me, the secret,—else, my lips are dumb.” XXIX No match for his, Osséo's limbs appeared, Weak with the fast; and yet in soul he grew Composed and resolute, by accents cheered, That spake in light what he but darkly knew. He rose, unto the issue nerved; he sent Into his arms the hope of the event. XXX The shining stranger wrestled long and hard, When, disengaging weary limbs, he said: “It is enough; with no unkind regard The Master's eye your toil hath visited. He bids me cease; to-day let strife remain; But on the morrow I will come again.” XXXI And on the morrow came he as before, Dropping serenely down the deep-blue air: More weak and languid was the boy, yet more Courageous he, that crowning test to bear. His soul so wrought in every fainting limb, It seemed the cruel fast had strengthened him. XXXII Again they grappled, and their sinews wrung In desperate emulation; and again Came words of comfort from the stranger's tongue When they had ceased. He scaled the heavenly plain, His tall, bright stature lessening as he rose, Till lost amid the infinite repose. XXXIII On the third day descending as before His raiment's gleam surprised the silent sky; And weaker still the poor boy felt, yet more Courageous he, and resolute to die, So he might first the promised good embrace, And leave a blessing unto all his race. XXXIV This time with intertwining limbs they strove; The God's green mantle shook in every fold, And o'er Osséo's heated forehead drove His silky hair, his tassel's dusty gold, Till, spent and breathless, he at last forbore, And sat to rest beside the lodge's door. XXXV “My friend,” he said, “the issue now is plain; Who wrestles in his soul must victor be; Who bids his life in payment shall attain The end he seeks,—and you will vanquish me. Then, these commands fulfilling, you shall win What the Great Spirit gives in Monda-Min. XXXVI “When I am dead, strip off this green array, And pluck the tassels from my shrivelled hair; Then bury me where summer rains shall play Above my breast, and sunshine linger there. Remove the matted sod; for I would have The earth lie lightly, softly on my grave. XXXVII “And tend the place, lest any noxious weed Through the sweet soil should strike its bitter root; Nor let the blossoms of the forest breed, Nor the wild grass in green luxuriance shoot; But when the earth is dry and blistered, fold Thereon the fresh and dainty-smelling mould. XXXVIII “The clamoring crow, the blackbird swarms that make The meadow trees their hive, must come not near: Scare thence all hurtful things; nor quite forsake Your careful watch until the woods appear With crimson blotches deeply dashed and crossed,— Sign of the fatal pestilence of Frost. XXXIX “This done, the secret, into knowledge grown, Is yours forevermore.” With that, he took The yielding air. Osséo, left alone, Followed his flight with hope-enraptured look. The pains of hunger fled; a happy flame Danced in his heart until the trial came. XL It happened so, as Mon-da-Min foretold; Osséo's soul, at every wreathing twist Of palpitating muscle, grew more bold, And from the limbs of his antagonist Celestial vigor to his own he drew, Till with one mighty heave he over threw. XLI Then from the body, beautiful and cold, He stripped the shining clothes; but on his breast He left the vest, engrained with blushing gold, And covered him in decent burial-rest. At sunset to his father's lodge he passed, And soothed with meat the anguish of his fast. XLII Naught did he speak of all that he had done, But day by day in secrecy he sought An opening in the forest, where the sun Warmed the new grave: so tenderly he wrought, So lightly heaped the mould, so carefully Kept all the place from choking herbage free, XLIII That in a little while a folded plume Pushed timidly the covering soil aside, And, fed by fattening rains, took broader room, Until it grew a stalk, and rustled wide Its leafy garments, lifting in the air Its tasselled top, and knots of silky hair. XLIV Osséo marvelled to behold his friend In this fair plant; the secret of the Spring Was his at length; and till the Summer's end He guarded him from every harmful thing. He scared the cloud of blackbirds, wheeling low; His arrow pierced the reconnoitring crow. XLV Now came the brilliant mornings, kindling all The woody hills with pinnacles of fire; The gum's ensanguined leaves began to fall, The buckeye blazed in prodigal attire, And frosty vapors left the lake at night To string the prairie grass with spangles white. XLVI One day, from long and unsuccessful chase The chief returned. Osséo through the wood In silence led him to the guarded place, Where now the plant in golden ripeness stood. “Behold, my father!” he exclaimed, “our friend, Whom the Great Spirit unto me did send, XLVII “Then, when I fasted, and my prayer He knew, That He would save my brothers from their want; For this, His messenger I overthrew, And from his grave was born this glorious plant. 'T is Mon-da-Min: his sheathing husks enclose Food for my brothers in the time of snows. XLVIII “I leave you now, my father! Here befits Me longer not to dwell. My pathway lies To where the West-wind on the mountain sits, And the Red Swan beyond the sunset flies: There may superior wisdom be in store.” And so he went, and he returned no more. XLIX But Mon-da-Min remained, and still remains; His children cover all the boundless land, And the warm sun and frequent mellow rains Shape the tall stalks and make the leaves expand. A mighty army they have grown: he drills Their green battalions on the summer hills. L And when the silky hair hangs crisp and dead, Then leave their rustling ranks the tasselled peers, In broad encampment pitch their tents instead, And garner up the ripe autumnal ears: The annual storehouse of a nation's need, From whose abundance all the world may feed. 1851. HYLAS Storm-wearied Argo slept upon the water. No cloud was seen; on blue and craggy Ida The hot noon lay, and on the plain's enamel; Cool, in his bed, alone, the swift Scamander. “Why should I haste?” said young and rosy Hylas: “The seas were rough, and long the way from Colchis. Beneath the snow-white awning slumbers Jason, Pillowed upon his tame Thessalian panther; The shields are piled, the listless oars suspended On the black thwarts, and all the hairy bondsmen Doze on the benches. They may wait for water, Till I have bathed in mountain-born Scamander.” So said, unfilleting his purple chlamys, And putting down his urn, he stood a moment, Breathing the faint, warm odor of the blossoms That spangled thick the lovely Dardan meadows. Then, stooping lightly, loosened he his buskins, And felt with shrinking feet the crispy verdure, Naked, save one light robe that from his shoulder Hung to his knee, the youthful flush revealing Of warm, white limbs, half-nerved with coming manhood, Yet fair and smooth with tenderness of beauty. Now to the river's sandy marge advancing, He dropped the robe, and raised his head exulting In the clear sunshine, that with beam embracing Held him against Apollo's glowing bosom. For sacred to Latona's son is Beauty, Sacred is Youth, the joy of youthful feeling. A joy indeed, a living joy, was Hylas, Whence Jove-begotten Hêraclês, the mighty, To men though terrible, to him was gentle, Smoothing his rugged nature into laughter When the boy stole his club, or from his shoulders Dragged the huge paws of the Nemæan lion. The thick, brown locks, tossed backward from his forehead, Fell soft about his temples; manhood's blossom Not yet had sprouted on his chin, but freshly Curved the fair cheek, and full the red lips, parting, Like a loose bow, that just has launched its arrow. His large blue eyes, with joy dilate and beamy, Were clear as the unshadowed Grecian heaven; Dewy and sleek his dimpled shoulders rounded To the white arms and whiter breast between them. Downward, the supple lines had less of softness: His back was like a god's; his loins were moulded As if some pulse of power began to waken; The springy fulness of his thighs, outswerving, Sloped to his knee, and, lightly dropping downward, Drew the curved lines that breathe, in rest, of motion. He saw his glorious limbs reversely mirrored In the still wave, and stretched his foot to press it On the smooth sole that answered at the surface: Alas! the shape dissolved in glimmering fragments. Then, timidly at first, he dipped, and catching Quick breath, with tingling shudder, as the waters Swirled round his thighs, and deeper, slowly deeper, Till on his breast the River's cheek was pillowed, And deeper still, till every shoreward ripple Talked in his ear, and like a cygnet's bosom His white, round shoulder shed the dripping crystal. There, as he floated, with a rapturous motion, The lucid coolness folding close around him, The lily-cradling ripples murmured, “Hylas!” He shook from off his ears the hyacinthine Curls, that had lain unwet upon the water, And still the ripples murmured, “Hylas! Hylas!” He thought: “The voices are but earborn music. Pan dwells not here, and Echo still is calling From some high cliff that tops a Thracian valley: So long mine ears, on tumbling Hellespontus, Have heard the sea waves hammer Argo's forehead, That I misdeem the fluting of this current For some lost nymph—” Again the murmur, “Hylas!” And with the sound a cold, smooth arm around him Slid like a wave, and down the clear, green darkness Glimmered on either side a shining bosom,— Glimmered, uprising slow; and ever closer Wound the cold arms, till, climbing to his shoulders, Their cheeks lay nestled, while the purple tangles Their loose hair made, in silken mesh enwound him. Their eyes of clear, pale emerald then uplifting, They kissed his neck with lips of humid coral, And once again there came a murmur, “Hylas! O, come with us! O, follow where we wander Deep down beneath the green, translucent ceiling,— Where on the sandy bed of old Scamander With cool white buds we braid our purple tresses, Lulled by the bubbling waves around us stealing! Thou fair Greek boy, O, come with us! O, follow Where thou no more shalt hear Propontis riot, But by our arms be lapped in endless quiet, Within the glimmering caves of Ocean hollow! We have no love; alone, of all the Immortals, We have no love. O, love us, we who press thee With faithful arms, though cold,—whose lips caress thee,— Who hold thy beauty prisoned! Love us, Hylas!” The boy grew chill to feel their twining pressure Lock round his limbs, and bear him, vainly striving, Down from the noonday brightness “Leave me, Naiads! Leave me!” he cried; “the day to me is dearer Than all your caves deep-sphered in Ocean's quiet. I am but mortal, seek but mortal pleasure: I would not change this flexile, warm existence, Though swept by storms, and shocked by Jove's dread thunder, To be a king beneath the dark-green waters.” Still moaned the humid lips, between their kisses, “We have no love. O, love us, we who love thee!” And came in answer, thus, the words of Hylas: “My love is mortal. For the Argive maidens I keep the kisses which your lips would ravish. Unlock your cold white arms,—take from my shoulder The tangled swell of your bewildering tresses. Let me return: the wind comes down from Ida, And soon the galley, stirring from her slumber, Will fret to ride where Pelion's twilight shadow Falls o'er the towers of Jason's sea-girt city. I am not yours,—I cannot braid the lilies In your wet hair, nor on your argent bosoms Close my drowsed eyes to hear your rippling voices. Hateful to me your sweet, cold, crystal being,— Your world of watery quiet. Help, Apollo! For I am thine: thy fire, thy beam, thy music, Dance in my heart and flood my sense with rapture! The joy, the warmth and passion now awaken, Promised by thee, but erewhile calmly sleeping. O, leave me, Naiads! loose your chill embraces, Or I shall die, for mortal maidens pining.” But still with unrelenting arms they bound him, And still, accordant, flowed their watery voices: “We have thee now,—we hold thy beauty prisoned; O, come with us beneath the emerald waters! We have no love: we have thee, rosy Hylas. O, love us, who shall nevermore release thee: Love us, whose milky arms will be thy cradle Far down on the untroubled sands of ocean, Where now we bear thee, clasped in our embraces.” And slowly, slowly sank the amorous Naiads; The boy's blue eyes, upturned, looked through the water, Pleading for help; but Heaven's immortal Archer Was swathed in cloud. The ripples hid his forehead, And last, the thick, bright curls a moment floated, So warm and silky that the stream upbore them, Closing reluctant, as he sank forever. The sunset died behind the crags of Imbros. Argo was tugging at her chain; for freshly Blew the swift breeze, and leaped the restless billows. The voice of Jason roused the dozing sailors, And up the mast was heaved the snowy canvas. But mighty Hêraclês, the Jove-begotten, Unmindful stood, beside the cool Scamander, Leaning upon his club. A purple chlamys Tossed o'er an urn was all that lay before him: And when he called, expectant, “Hylas! Hylas!” The empty echoes made him answer,—“Hylas!” 1850. KUBLEH A STORY OF THE ASSYRIAN DESERT The black-eyed children of the Desert drove Their flocks together at the set of sun. The tents were pitched; the weary camels bent Their suppliant necks, and knelt upon the sand; The hunters quartered by the kindled fires The wild boars of the Tigris they had slain, And all the stir and sound of evening ran Throughout the Shammar camp. The dewy air Bore its full burden of confused delight Across the flowery plain; and while, afar, The snows of Koordish Mountains in the ray Flashed roseate amber, Nimroud's ancient mound Rose broad and black against the burning West. The shadows deepened, and the stars came out, Sparkling in violet ether; one by one Glimmered the ruddy camp-fires on the plain, And shapes of steed and horseman moved among The dusky tents, with shout and jostling cry, And neigh and restless prancing. Children ran To hold the thongs, while every rider drove His quivering spear in the earth, and by his door Tethered the horse he loved. In midst of all Stood Shammeriyah, whom they dared not touch,— The foal of wondrous Kubleh, to the Shekh A dearer wealth than all his Georgian girls. But when their meal was o'er,—when the red fires Blazed brighter, and the dogs no longer bayed,— When Shammar hunters with the boys sat down To cleanse their bloody knives, came Alimàr, The poet of the tribe, whose songs of love Are sweeter than Bassora's nightingales,— Whose songs of war can fire the Arab blood Like war itself: who knows not Alimàr? Then asked the men, “O Poet, sing of Kubleh!” And boys laid down the burnished knives and said, “Tell us of Kubleh, whom we never saw,— Of wondrous Kubleh!” Closer drew the group, With eager eyes, about the flickering fire, While Alimàr, beneath the Assyrian stars, Sang to the listening Arabs: “God is great! O Arabs! never since Mohammed rode The sands of Beder, and by Mecca's gate That wingèd steed bestrode, whose mane of fire Blazed up the zenith, when, by Allah called, He bore the Prophet to the walls of Heaven, Was like to Kubleh, Sofuk's wondrous mare: Not all the milk-white barbs, whose hoofs dashed flame, In Baghdad's stables, from the marble floor,— Who, swathed in purple housings, pranced in state The gay bazaars, by great Al-Raschid backed: Not the wild charger of Mongolian breed That went o'er half the world with Tamerlane: Nor yet those flying coursers, long ago From Ormuz brought by swarthy Indian grooms To Persia's kings,—the foals of sacred mares, Sired by the fiery stallions of the sea! “Who ever told, in all the Desert Land, The many deeds of Kubleh? Who can tell Whence came she? whence her like shall come again? O Arabs! sweet as tales of Scheherazade Heard in the camp, when javelin shafts are tried On the hot eve of battle, are the words That tell the marvels of her history. “Far in the Southern sands, the hunters say, Did Sofuk find her, by a lonely palm. The well had dried; her fierce, impatient eye Glared red and sunken, and her slight young limbs Were lean with thirst. He checked his camel's pace, And, while it knelt, untied the water-skin, And when the wild mare drank, she followed him. Thence none but Sofuk might the saddle gird Upon her back, or clasp the brazen gear About her shining head, that brooked no curb From even him; for she, alike, was royal. “Her form was lighter, in its shifting grace, Than some impassioned almeh's, when the dance Unbinds her scarf, and golden anklets gleam, Through floating drapery, on the buoyant air. Her light, free head was ever held aloft; Between her slender and transparent ears The silken forelock tossed; her nostril's arch, Thin-blown, in proud and pliant beauty spread Snuffing the desert winds. Her glossy neck Curved to the shoulder like an eagle's wing, And all her matchless lines of flank and limb Seemed fashioned from the flying shapes of air. When sounds of warlike preparation rang From tent to tent, her keen and restless eye Shone blood-red as a ruby, and her neigh Rang wild and sharp above the clash of spears. “The tribes of Tigris and the Desert knew her: Sofuk before the Shammar bands she bore To meet the dread Jebours, who waited not To bid her welcome; and the savage Koord, Chased from his bold irruption on the plain, Has seen her hoof-prints in his mountain snow. Lithe as the dark-eyed Syrian gazelle, O'er ledge, and chasm, and barren steep amid The Sinjar-hills, she ran the wild ass down. Through many a battle's thickest brunt she stormed, Reeking with sweat and dust, and fetlock deep In curdling gore. When hot and lurid haze Stifled the crimson sun, she swept before The whirling sand-spout, till her gusty mane Flared in its vortex, while the camels lay Groaning and helpless on the fiery waste. “The tribes of Taurus and the Caspian knew her: The Georgian chiefs have heard her trumpet neigh Before the walls of Tiflis; pines that grow On ancient Caucasus have harbored her, Sleeping by Sofuk in their spicy gloom. The surf of Trebizond has bathed her flanks, When from the shore she saw the white-sailed bark That brought him home from Stamboul. Never yet, O Arabs! never yet was like to Kubleh! “And Sofuk loved her. She was more to him Than all his snowy-bosomed odalisques. For many years she stood beside his tent, The glory of the tribe. “At last she died,— Died, while the fire was yet in all her limbs,— Died for the life of Sofuk, whom she loved. The base Jebours,—on whom be Allah's curse!— Came on his path, when far from any camp, And would have slain him, but that Kubleh sprang Against the javelin points, and bore them down, And gained the open Desert. Wounded sore, She urged her light limbs into maddening speed, And made the wind a laggard. On and on The red sand slid beneath her, and behind Whirled in a swift and cloudy turbulence, As when some star of Eblis, downward hurled By Allah's bolt, sweeps with its burning hair The waste of darkness. On and on the bleak, Bare ridges rose before her, came, and passed, And every flying leap with fresher blood Her nostrils stained, till Sofuk's brow and breast Were flecked with crimson foam. He would have turned To save his treasure, though himself were lost, But Kubleh fiercely snapped the brazen rein. At last, when through her spent and quivering frame The sharp throes ran, our clustering tents arose, And with a neigh, whose shrill access of joy O'ercame its agony, she stopped and fell. The Shammar men came round her as she lay, And Sofuk raised her head, and held it close Against his breast. Her dull and glazing eye Met his, and with a shuddering gasp she died. Then like a child his bursting grief made way In passionate tears, and with him all the tribe Wept for the faithful mare. “They dug her grave Amid El-Hather's marbles, where she lies Buried with ancient kings; and since that time Was never seen, and will not be again. O Arabs! though the world be doomed to live As many moons as count the desert sands, The like of glorious Kubleh. God is great!” 1849. METEMPSYCHOSIS OF THE PINE As when the haze of some wan moonlight makes Familiar fields a land of mystery, Where, chill and strange, a ghostly presence wakes In flower, and bush, and tree,— Another life, the life of Day o'erwhelms; The Past from present consciousness takes hue, And we remember vast and cloudy realms Our feet have wandered through: So, oft, some moonlight of the mind makes dumb The stir of outer thought: wide open seems The gate wherethrough strange sympathies have come, The secret of our dreams; The source of fine impressions, shooting deep Below the failing plummet of the sense; Which strike beyond all Time, and backward sweep Through all intelligence. We touch the lower life of beast and clod, And the long process of the ages see From blind old Chaos, ere the breath of God Moved it to harmony. All outward wisdom yields to that within, Whereof nor creed nor canon holds the key; We only feel that we have ever been, And evermore shall be. And thus I know, by memories unfurled In rarer moods, and many a nameless sign, That once in Time, and somewhere in the world, I was a towering Pine, Rooted upon a cape that overhung The entrance to a mountain gorge whereon The wintry shadow of a peak was flung, Long after rise of sun. Behind, the silent snows; and wide below, The rounded hills made level, lessening down To where a river washed with sluggish flow A many-templed town. There did I clutch the granite with firm feet, There shake my boughs above the roaring gulf, When mountain whirlwinds through the passes beat, And howled the mountain wolf. There did I louder sing than all the floods Whirled in white foam above the precipice, And the sharp sleet that stung the naked woods Answer with sullen hiss: But when the peaceful clouds rose white and high On blandest airs that April skies could bring, Through all my fibres thrilled the tender sigh. The sweet unrest of Spring. She, with warm fingers laced in mine, did melt In fragrant balsam my reluctant blood; And with a smart of keen delight I felt The sap in every bud, And tingled through my rough old bark, and fast Pushed out the younger green, that smoothed my tones, When last year's needles to the wind I cast, And shed my scaly cones. I held the eagle till the mountain mist Rolled from the azure paths he came to soar, And like a hunter, on my gnarled wrist The dappled falcon bore. Poised o'er the blue abyss, the morning lark Sang, wheeling near in rapturous carouse; And hart and hind, soft-pacing through the dark, Slept underneath my boughs. Down on the pasture-slopes the herdsman lay, And for the flock his birchen trumpet blew; There ruddy children tumbled in their play, And lovers came to woo. And once an army, crowned with triumph, came Out of the hollow bosom of the gorge, With mighty banners in the wind aflame, Borne on a glittering surge Of tossing spears, a flood that homeward rolled, While cymbals timed their steps of victory, And horn and clarion from their throats of gold Sang with a savage glee. I felt the mountain walls below me shake, Vibrant with sound, and through my branches poured The glorious gust: my song thereto did make Magnificent accord. Some blind harmonic instinct pierced the rind Of that slow life which made me straight and high, And I became a harp for every wind, A voice for every sky; When fierce autumnal gales began to blow, Roaring all day in concert, hoarse and deep; And then made silent with my weight of snow— A spectre on the steep; Filled with a whispering gush, like that which flows Through organ-stops, when sank the sun's red disk Beyond the city, and in blackness rose Temple and obelisk; Or breathing soft, as one who sighs in prayer, Mysterious sounds of portent and of might, What time I felt the wandering waves of air Pulsating through the night. And thus for centuries my rhythmic chant Rolled down the gorge, or surged about the hill: Gentle, or stern, or sad, or jubilant, At every season's will. No longer Memory whispers whence arose The doom that tore me from my place of pride: Whether the storms that load the peak with snows, And start the mountain-slide, Let fall a fiery bolt to smite my top, Upwrenched my roots, and o'er the precipice Hurled me, a dangling wreck, erelong to drop Into the wild abyss; Or whether hands of men, with scornful strength And force from Nature's rugged armory lent, Sawed through my heart and rolled my tumbling length Sheer down the steep descent. All sense departed, with the boughs I wore; And though I moved with mighty gales at strife, A mast upon the seas, I sang no more, And music was my life. Yet still that life awakens, brings again Its airy anthems, resonant and long, Till Earth and Sky, transfigured, fill my brain With rhythmic sweeps of song. Thence am I made a poet: thence are sprung Those shadowy motions of the soul, that reach Beyond all grasp of Art,—for which the tongue Is ignorant of speech. And if some wild, full-gathered harmony Roll its unbroken music through my line, There lives and murmurs, faintly though it be, The Spirit of the Pine. 1851. THE SOLDIER AND THE PARD A second deluge! Well,—no matter: here, At least, is better shelter than the lean, Sharp-elbowed oaks,—a dismal company! That stood around us in the mountain road When that cursed axle broke: a roof of thatch, A fire of withered boughs, and best of all, This ruddy wine of Languedoc, that warms One through and through, from heart to finger-ends. No better quarters for a stormy night A soldier, like myself, could ask; and since The rough Cevennes refuse to let us forth, Why, fellow-travellers, if so you will, I'll tell the story cut so rudely short When both fore-wheels broke from the diligence, Stocked in the rut, and pitched us all together: I said, we fought beside the Pyramids; And somehow, from the glow of this good wine, And from the gloomy rain, that shuts one in With his own self,—a sorry mate sometimes!— The scene comes back like life. As then, I feel The sun, and breathe the hot Egyptian air, Hear Kleber, see the sabre of Dessaix Flash at the column's front, and in the midst Napoleon, upon his Barbary horse, Calm, swarthy-browed, and wiser than the Sphinx Whose granite lips guard Egypt's mystery. Ha! what a rout! our cannon bellowed round The Pyramids: the Mamelukes closed in, And hand to hand like devils did we fight, Rolled towards Sakkara in the smoke and sand. For days we followed up the Nile. We pitched Our tents in Memphis, pitched them on the site Of Antinoë, and beside the cliffs Of Aboufayda. Then we came anon On Kenneh, ere the sorely-frightened Bey Had time to pack his harem: nay, we took His camels, not his wives: and so, from day To day, past wrecks of temples half submerged In sandy inundation, till we saw Old noseless Memnon sitting on the plain, Both hands upon his knees, and in the east Karnak's propylon and its pillared court. The sphinxes wondered—such as had a face— To see us stumbling down their avenues; But we kept silent. One may whistle round Your Roman temples here at Nismes, or dance Upon the Pont du Gard;—but, take my word, Egyptian ruins are a serious thing: You would not dare let fly a joke beside The maimed colossi, though your very feet Might catch between some mummied Pharaoh's ribs. Dessaix was bent on chasing Mamelukes, And so we rummaged tomb and catacomb, Clambered the hills and watched the Desert's rim For sight of horse. One day my company (I was but ensign then) found far within The sands, a two-days' journey from the Nile, A round oasis, like a jewel set. It was a grove of date-trees, clustering close About a tiny spring, whose overflow Trickled beyond their shade a little space, And the insatiate Desert licked it up. The fiery ride, the glare of afternoon Had burned our faces, so we stopped to feel The coolness and the shadow, like a bath Of pure ambrosial lymph, receive our limbs And sweeten every sense. Drowsed by the soft, Delicious greenness and repose, I crept Into a balmy nest of yielding shrubs, And floated off to slumber on a cloud Of rapturous sensation. When I woke, So deep had been the oblivion of that sleep, That Adam, when he woke in Paradise, Was not more blank of knowledge; he had felt As heedlessly, the silence and the shade; As ignorantly had raised his eyes and seen— As, for a moment, I—what then I saw With terror, freezing limb and voice like death, When the slow sense, supplying one lost link, Ran with electric fleetness through the chain And showed me what I was,—no miracle, But lost and left alone amid the waste, Fronting a deadly Pard, that kept great eyes Fixed steadily on mine. I could not move: My heart beat slow and hard: I sat and gazed, Without a wink, upon those jasper orbs, Noting the while, with horrible detail, Whereto my fascinated sight was bound, Their tawny brilliance, and the spotted fell That wrinkled round them, smoothly sloping back And curving to the short and tufted ears. I felt—and with a sort of fearful joy— The beauty of the creature: 't was a pard, Not such as one of those they show you caged In Paris,—lean and scurvy beasts enough! No: but a desert pard, superb and proud, That would have died behind the cruel bars. I think the creature had not looked on man, For, as my brain grew cooler, I could see Small sign of fierceness in her eyes, but chief, Surprise and wonder. More and more entranced, Her savage beauty warmed away the chill Of deathlike terror at my heart: I stared With kindling admiration, and there came A gradual softness o'er the flinty light Within her eyes; a shadow crept around Their yellow disks, and something like a dawn Of recognition of superior will, Of brute affection, sympathy enslaved By higher nature, then informed her face. Thrilling in every nerve, I stretched my hand,— She silent, moveless,—touched her velvet head, And with a warm, sweet shiver in my blood, Stroked down the ruffled hairs. She did not start; But, in a moment's lapse, drew up one paw And moved a step,—another,—till her breath Came hot upon my face. She stopped: she rolled A deep-voiced note of pleasure and of love, And gathering up her spotted length, lay down, Her head upon my lap, and forward thrust One heavy-moulded paw across my knees, The glittering talons sheathing tenderly. Thus we, in that oasis all alone, Sat when the sun went down: the Pard and I, Caressing and caressed: and more of love And more of confidence between us came, I grateful for my safety, she alive With the dumb pleasure of companionship, Which touched with instincts of humanity Her brutish nature. When I slept, at last, My arm was on her neck. The morrow brought No rupture of the bond between us twain. The creature loved me; she would bounding come, Cat-like, to rub her great, smooth, yellow head Against my knee, or with rough tongue would lick The hand that stroked the velvet of her hide. How beautiful she was! how lithe and free The undulating motions of her frame! How shone, like isles of tawny gold, her spots, Mapped on the creamy white! And when she walked, No princess, with the crown about her brows, Looked so superbly royal. Ah, my friends, Smile as you may, but I would give this life With its fantastic pleasures—aye, even that One leads in Paris—to be back again In the red Desert with my splendid Pard. That grove of date-trees was our home, our world, A star of verdure in a sky of sand. Without the feathery fringes of its shade The naked Desert ran, its burning round Sharp as a sword: the naked sky above, Awful in its immensity, not shone There only, where the sun supremely flamed, But all its deep-blue walls were penetrant With dazzling light. God reigned in Heaven and Earth, An Everlasting Presence, and his care Fed us, alike his children. From the trees That shook down pulpy dates, and from the spring, The quiet author of that happy grove, My wants were sated; and when midnight came, Then would the Pard steal softly from my side, Take the unmeasured sand with flying leaps And vanish in the dusk, returning soon With a gazelle's light carcass in her jaws. So passed the days, and each the other taught Our simple language. She would come at call Of the pet name I gave her, bound and sport When so I bade, and she could read my face Through all its changing moods, with better skill Than many a Christian comrade. Pard and beast, Though you may say she was, she had a soul. But Sin will find the way to Paradise. Erelong the sense of isolation fed My mind with restless fancies. I began To miss the life of camp, the march, the fight, The soldier's emulation: youthful blood Ran in my veins: the silence lost its charm, And when the morning sunrise lighted up The threshold of the Desert, I would gaze With looks of bitter longing o'er the sand. At last, I filled my soldier's sash with dates, Drank deeply of the spring, and while the Pard Roamed in the starlight for her forage took A westward course. The grove already lay A dusky speck—no more—when through the night Came the forsaken creature's eager cry. Into a sandy pit I crept, and heard Her bounding on my track until she rolled Down from the brink upon me. Then with cries Of joy and of distress, the touching proof Of the poor beast's affection, did she strive To lift me—Pardon, friends! these foolish eyes Must have their will: and had you seen her then, In her mad gambols, as we homeward went, Your hearts had softened too. But I, possessed By some vile devil of mistrust, became More jealous and impatient. In my heart I cursed the grove, and with suspicions wronged The noble Pard. She keeps me here, I thought, Deceived with false caresses, as a cat Toys with the trembling mouse she straight devours. Will she so gently fawn about my feet, When the gazelles are gone? Will she crunch dates, And drink the spring, whose only drink is blood? Am I to ruin flattered, and by whom?— Not even a man, a wily beast of prey. Thus did the Devil whisper in mine ear, Till those black thoughts were rooted in my heart And made me cruel. So it chanced one day, That as I watched a flock of birds that wheeled, And dipped, and circled in the air, the Pard, Moved by a freak of fond solicitude To win my notice, closed her careful fangs About my knee. Scarce knowing what I did, In the blind impulse of suspicious fear, I plunged, full home, my dagger in her neck. God! could I but recall that blow! She loosed Her hold, as softly as a lover quits His mistress' lips, and with a single groan, Full of reproach and sorrow, sank and died. What had I done! Sure never on this earth Did sharper grief so base a deed requite. Its murderous fury gone, my heart was racked With pangs of wild contrition, spent itself In cries and tears, the while I called on God To curse me for my sin. There lay the Pard, Her splendid eyes all film, her blazoned fell Smirched with her blood; and I, her murderer, Less than a beast, had thus repaid her love. Ah, friends! with all this guilty memory My heart is sore: and little now remains To tell you, but that afterwards—how long, I could not know—our soldiers picked me up, Wandering about the Desert, wild with grief And sobbing like a child. My nerves have grown To steel, in many battles; I can step Without a shudder through the heaps of slain; But never, never, till the day I die, Prevent a woman's weakness when I think Upon my desert Pard: and if a man Deny this truth she taught me, to his face I say he lies: a beast may have a soul. 1851. ARIEL IN THE CLOVEN PINE Now the frosty stars are gone: I have watched them one by one, Fading on the shores of Dawn. Round and full the glorious sun Walks with level step the spray, Through his vestibule of Day, While the wolves that late did howl Slink to dens and coverts foul, Guarded by the demon owl, Who, last night, with mocking croon, Wheeled athwart the chilly moon, And with eyes that blankly glared On my direful torment stared. The lark is flickering in the light; Still the nightingale doth sing;— All the isle, alive with Spring, Lies, a jewel of delight, On the blue sea's heaving breast: Not a breath from out the West, But some balmy smell doth bring From the sprouting myrtle buds, Or from meadowy vales that lie Like a green inverted sky, Which the yellow cowslip stars, And the bloomy almond woods, Cloud-like, cross with roseate bars. All is life that I can spy, To the farthest sea and sky, And my own the only pain Within this ring of Tyrrhene main. In the gnarled and cloven Pine Where that hell-born hag did chain me All this orb of cloudless shine, All this youth in Nature's veins Tingling with the season's wine, With a sharper torment pain me. Pansies in soft April rains Fill their stalks with honeyed sap Drawn from Earth's prolific lap; But the sluggish blood she brings To the tough Pine's hundred rings Closer locks their cruel hold, Closer draws the scaly bark Round the crevice, damp and cold, Where my useless wings I fold,— Sealing me in iron dark. By this coarse and alien state Is my dainty essence wronged; Finer senses that belonged To my freedom, chafe at Fate, Till the happier elves I hate, Who in moonlight dances turn Underneath the palmy fern, Or in light and twinkling bands Follow on with linkèd hands To the Ocean's yellow sands. Primrose-eyes each morning ope In their cool, deep beds of grass; Violets make the airs that pass Telltales of their fragrant slope. I can see them where they spring Never brushed by fairy wing. All those corners I can spy In the island's solitude, Where the dew is never dry, Nor the miser bees intrude. Cups of rarest hue are there, Full of perfumed wine undrained,— Mushroom banquets, ne'er profaned, Canopied by maiden-hair. Pearls I see upon the sands, Never touched by other hands, And the rainbow bubbles shine On the ridged and frothy brine, Tenantless of voyager Till they burst in vacant air. Oh, the songs that sung might be, And the mazy dances woven, Had that witch ne'er crossed the sea And the Pine been never cloven! Many years my direst pain Has made the wave-rocked isle complain. Winds, that from the Cyclades Came, to blow in wanton riot Round its shore's enchanted quiet, Bore my wailings on the seas: Sorrowing birds in Autumn went Through the world with my lament. Still the bitter fate is mine, All delight unshared to see, Smarting in the cloven Pine, While I wait the tardy axe Which, perchance, shall set me free From the damned Witch Sycorax. 1849. POEMS OF THE ORIENT 1851–1854 Da der West war durchgekostet, Hat er nun den Ost entmostet. Rückert. PROEM DEDICATORY AN EPISTLE FROM MOUNT TMOLUS TO RICHARD HENRY STODDARD I O Friend, were you but couched on Tmolus' side, In the warm myrtles, in the golden air Of the declining day, which half lays bare, Half drapes, the silent mountains and the wide Embosomed vale, that wanders to the sea; And the far sea, with doubtful specks of sail, And farthest isles, that slumber tranquilly Beneath the Ionian autumn's violet veil;— Were you but with me, little were the need Of this imperfect artifice of rhyme, Where the strong Fancy peals a broken chime And the ripe brain but sheds a abortive seed. But I am solitary, and the curse, Or blessing, which has clung to me from birth— The torment and the ecstasy of verse— Comes up to me from the illustrious earth Of ancient Tmolus; and the very stones, Reverberant, din the mellow air with tones Which the sweet air remembers; and they blend With fainter echoes, which the mountains fling From far oracular caverns: so, my Friend, I cannot choose but sing! II Unto mine eye, less plain the shepherds be, Tending their browsing goats amid the broom, Or the slow camels, travelling towards the sea, Laden with bales from Baghdad's gaudy loom, Or yon nomadic Turcomans, that go Down from their summer pastures—than the twain Immortals, who on Tmolus' thymy top Sang, emulous, the rival strain! Down the charmed air did light Apollo drop; Great Pan ascended from the vales below. I see them sitting in the silent glow; I hear the alternating measures flow From pipe and golden lyre;—the melody Heard by the Gods between their nectar bowls, Or when, from out the chambers of the sea, Comes the triumphant Morning, and unrolls A pathway for the sun; then, following swift, The dædal harmonies of awful caves Cleft in the hills, and forests that uplift Their sea-like boom, in answer to the waves, With many a lighter strain, that dances o'er The wedded reeds, till Echo strives in vain To follow: Hark! once more, How floats the God's exultant strain In answer to Apollo! “The wind in the reeds and the rushes, The bees on the bells of thyme, The birds on the myrtle bushes, The cicàle above in the lime, And the lizards below in the grass Are as silent as ever old Tmolus was, Listening to my sweet pipings.” III I cannot separate the minstrels' worth; Each is alike transcendent and divine. What were the Day, unless it lighted Earth? And what were Earth, should Day forget to shine! But were you here, my Friend, we twain would build Two altars, on the mountain's sunward side: There Pan should o'er my sacrifice preside, And there Apollo your oblation gild. He is your God, but mine is shaggy Pan; Yet, as their music no discordance made, So shall our offerings side by side be laid, And the same wind the rival incense fan. IV You strain your ear to catch the harmonies That in some finer region have their birth; I turn, despairing, from the quest of these, And seek to learn the native tongue of Earth. In “Fancy's tropic clime” your castle stands, A shining miracle of rarest art; I pitch my tent upon the naked sands, And the tall palm, that plumes the orient lands, Can with its beauty satisfy my heart. You, in your starry trances, breathe the air Of lost Elysium, pluck the snowy bells Of lotus and Olympian asphodels, And bid us their diviner odors share. I at the threshold of that world have lain, Gazed on its glory, heard the grand acclaim Wherewith its trumpets hail the sons of Fame, And striven its speech to master—but in vain. And now I turn, to find a late content In Nature, making mine her myriad shows; Better contented with one living rose Than all the Gods' ambrosia; sternly bent On wresting from her hand the cup, whence flow The flavors of her ruddiest life—the change Of climes and races—the unshackled range Of all experience;—that my songs my show The warm red blood that beats in hearts of men, And those who read them in the festering den Of cities, may behold the open sky, And hear the rhythm of the winds that blow, Instinct with Freedom. Blame me not, that I Find in the forms of Earth a deeper joy Than in the dreams which lured me as a boy, And leave the Heavens, where you are wandering still With bright Apollo, to converse with Pan; For, though full soon our courses separate ran, We, like the Gods, can meet on Tmolus' hill. V There is no jealous rivalry in Song: I see your altar on the hill-top shine, And mine is built in shadows of the Pine, Yet the same worships unto each belong. Different the Gods, yet one the sacred awe Their presence brings us, one the reverent heart Wherewith we honor the immortal law Of that high inspiration, which is Art. Take, therefore, Friend! these Voices of the Earth, The rhythmic records of my life's career, Humble, perhaps, yet wanting not the worth Of Truth, and to the heart of Nature near. Take them, and your acceptance, in the dearth Of the world's tardy praise, shall make them dear. A PÆAN TO THE DAWN I The dusky sky fades into blue, And bluer waters bind us; The stars are glimmering faint and few, The night is left behind us! Turn not where sinks the sullen dark Before the signs of warning, But crowd the canvas on our bark And sail to meet the morning. Rejoice! rejoice! the hues that fill The orient, flush and lighten; And over the blue Ionian hill The Dawn begins to brighten! II We leave the Night, that weighed so long Upon the soul's endeavor, For Morning, on these hills of Song, Has made her home forever. Hark to the sound of trump and lyre, In the olive-groves before us, And the rhythmic beat, the pulse of fire Throbs in the full-voice chorus! More than Memnonian grandeur speaks In the triumph of the pæan, And all the glory of the Greeks Breathes o'er the old Ægean. III Here shall the ancient Dawn return, That lit the earliest poet, Whose very ashes in his urn Would radiate glory through it,— The dawn of Life, when Life was Song, And Song the life of Nature, And the Singer stood amid the throng,— A God in every feature! When Love was free, and free as air The utterance of Passion, And the heart in every fold lay bare, Nor shamed its true expression. IV Then perfect limb and perfect face Surpassed our best ideal; Unconscious Nature's law was grace,— The Beautiful was real. For men acknowledged true desires, And light as garlands wore them; They were begot by vigorous sires, And noble mothers bore them. Oh, when the shapes of Art they planned Were living forms of passion, Impulse and Deed went hand in hand, And Life was more than Fashion! V The seeds of Song they scattered first Flower in all later pages; Their forms have woke the Artist's thirst Through the succeeding ages: But I will seek the fountain-head Whence flowed their inspiration, And lead the unshackled life they led, Accordant with Creation. The World's false life, that follows still, Has ceased its chain to tighten, And over the blue Ionian hill I see the sunrise brighten? 1854. THE POET IN THE EAST The Poet came to the Land of the East, When spring was in the air: The Earth was dressed for a wedding feast, So young she seemed, and fair; And the Poet knew the Land of the East,— His soul was native there. All things to him were the visible forms Of early and precious dreams,— Familiar visions that mocked his quest Beside the Western streams, Or gleamed in the gold of the clouds, unrolled In the sunset's dying beams. He looked above in the cloudless calm, And the Sun sat on his throne; The breath of gardens, deep in balm, Was all about him blown, And a brother to him was the princely Palm, For he cannot live alone. His feet went forth on the myrtled hills, And the flowers their welcome shed; The meads of milk-white asphodel They knew the Poet's tread, And far and wide, in a scarlet tide, The poppy's bonfire spread. And, half in shade and half in sun, The Rose sat in her bower, With a passionate thrill in her crimson heart— She had waited for the hour! And, like a bride's, the Poet kissed The lips of the glorious flower. Then the Nightingale, who sat above In the boughs of the citron-tree, Sang: We are no rivals, brother mine, Except in minstrelsy; For the rose you kissed with the kiss of love, She is faithful still to me. And further sang the Nightingale: Your bower not distant lies. I heard the sound of a Persian lute From the jasmined window rise, And, twin-bright stars, through the lattice-bars, I saw the Sultana's eyes. The Poet said: I will here abide, In the Sun's unclouded door; Here are the wells of all delight On the lost Arcadian shore: Here is the light on sea and land, And the dream deceives no more. Cawnpore, 1853. THE TEMPTATION OF HASSAN BEN KHALED I Hassan Ben Khaled, singing in the streets Of Cairo, sang these verses at my door: “Blessed is he, who God and Prophet greets Each morn with prayer; but he is blest much more Whose conduct is his prayer's interpreter Sweeter than musk, and pleasanter than myrrh, Richer than rubies, shall his portion be, When God bids Azrael, ‘Bring him unto me!’ But woe to him whose life casts dirt upon The Prophet's word! When all his days are done, Him shall the Evil Angel trample down Out of the sight of God.” Thus, with a frown Of the severest virtue, Hassan sang Unto the people, till the markets rang. II But two days after this, he came again And sang, and I remarked an altered strain. Before my shop he stood, with forehead bent Like one whose sin hath made him penitent,— In whom the pride, that like a stately reed Lifted his head, is broken. “Blest indeed,” (These were his words,) “is he who never fell, But blest much more, who from the verge of Hell Climbs up to Paradise: for Sin is sweet; Strong is Temptation; willing are the feet That follow Pleasure, manifold her snares, And pitfalls lurk beneath our very prayers: Yet God, the Clement, the Compassionate, In pity of our weakness keeps the gate Of Pardon open, scorning not to wait Till the last moment, when His mercy flings Splendor from the shade of Azrael's wings.” “Wherefore, O Poet!” I to Hassan said, “This altered measure? Wherefore hang your head, O Hassan! whom the pride of virtue gives The right to face the holiest man that lives? Enter, I pray thee: this poor house will be Honored henceforth, if it may shelter thee.” Hassan Ben Khaled lifted up his eyes To mine, a moment: then, in cheerful guise, He passed my threshold with unslippered feet. III I led him from the noises of the street To the cool inner chambers, where my slave Poured out the pitcher's rosy-scented wave Over his hands, and laid upon his knee The napkin, silver-fringed: and when the pipe Exhaled a grateful odor from the ripe Latakian leaves, said Hassan unto me: “Listen, O Man! no man can truly say That he hath wisdom. What I sang to-day Was not less truth than what I sang before, But to Truth's house there is a single door, Which is Experience. He teaches best, Who feels the hearts of all men in his breast, And knows their strength or weakness through his own. The holy pride, that never was o'erthrown, Was never tempted, and its words of blame Reach but the dull ears of the multitude: The admonitions, fruitful unto good, Come from the voice of him who conquers shame.” IV “Give me, O Poet! (if thy friend may be Worthy such confidence,)” I said, “the key Unto thy words, that I may share with thee Thine added wisdom.” Hassan's kindly eye Before his lips unclosed, spake willingly, And he began: “But two days since, I went Singing what thou didst hear, with soul intent On my own virtue, all the markets through; And when about the time of prayer, I drew Near the Gate of Victory, behold! There came a man, whose turban fringed with gold And golden cimeter, bespake his wealth: ‘May God prolong thy days, O Hassan! Health And Fortune be thy wisdom's aids!’ he cried; ‘Come to my garden by the river's side, Where other poets wait thee. Be my guest, For even the Prophets had their times of rest, And Rest, that strengthens unto virtuous deeds, Is one with Prayer.’ Two royal-blooded steeds, Held by his grooms, were waiting at the gate, And though I shrank from such unwonted state The master's words were manna to my pride, And, mounting straightway, forth we twain did ride Unto the garden by the river's side. V “Never till then had I beheld such bloom. The west-wind sent its heralds of perfume To bid us welcome, midway on the road. Full in the sun the marble portal glowed Like silver, but within the garden wall No ray of sunshine found a place to fall, So thick the crowning foliage of the trees, Roofing the walks with twilight; and the air Under their tops was greener than the seas, And cool as they. The forms that wandered there Resembled those who populate the floor Of Ocean, and the royal lineage own That gave a Princess unto Persia's throne. All fruits the trees of this fair garden bore, Whose balmy fragrance lured the tongue to taste Their flavors: there bananas flung to waste Their golden flagons with thick honey filled; From splintered cups the ripe pomegranates spilled A shower of rubies; oranges that glow Like globes of fire, enclosed a heart of snow Which thawed not in their flame; like balls of gold The peaches seemed, that had in blood been rolled; Pure saffron mixed with clearest amber stained The apricots; bunches of amethyst And sapphire seemed the grapes, so newly kissed That still the mist of Beauty's breath remained; And where the lotus slowly swung in air Her snowy-bosomed chalice, rosy-veined, The golden fruit swung softly-cradled there, Even as a bell upon the bosom swings Of some fair dancer,—happy bell, that sings For joy, its golden tinkle keeping time To the heart's beating and the cymbal's chime! There dates of agate and of jasper lay, Dropped from the bounty of the pregnant palm, And all ambrosial trees, all fruits of balm, All flowers of precious odors, made the day Sweet as a morn of Paradise. My breath Failed with the rapture, and with doubtful mind I turned to where the garden's lord reclined, And asked, ‘Was not that gate the Gate of Death?’ VI “The guests were near a fountain. As I came They rose in welcome, wedding to my name Titles of honor, linked in choicest phrase, For Poets' ears are ever quick to Praise, The ‘Open Sesamè!’ whose magic art Forces the guarded entrance of the heart. Young men were they, whose manly beauty made Their words the sweeter, and their speech displayed Knowledge of men, and of the Prophet's laws. Pleasant our converse was, where every pause Gave to the fountain leave to sing its song, Suggesting further speech; until, erelong, There came a troop of swarthy slaves, who bore Ewers and pitchers all of silver ore, Wherein we washed our hands; then, tables placed, And brought us meats of every sumptuous taste That makes the blood rich,—pheasants stuffed with spice; Young lambs, whose entrails were of cloves and rice; Ducks bursting with pistachio nuts, and fish That in a bed of parsley swam. Each dish, Cooked with such art, seemed better than the last, And our indulgence in the rich repast Brought on the darkness ere we missed the day: But lamps were lighted in the fountain's spray, Or, pendent from the boughs, their colors told What fruits unseen, of crimson or of gold, Scented the gloom. Then took the generous host A basket filled with roses. Every guest Cried, ‘Give me roses!’ and he thus addressed His words to all: ‘He who exalts them most In song, he only shall the roses wear.’ Then sang a guest: ‘The rose's cheeks are fair; It crowns the purple bowl, and no one knows If the rose colors it, or it the rose.’ And sang another: ‘Crimson is its hue, And on its breast the morning's crystal dew Is changed to rubies.’ Then a third replied: ‘It blushes in the sun's enamored sight, As a young virgin on her wedding night, When from her face the bridegroom lifts the veil.’ When all had sung their songs, I, Hassan, tried. ‘The Rose,’ I sang, ‘is either red or pale, Like maidens whom the flame of passion burns, And Love or Jealousy controls, by turns. Its buds are lips preparing for a kiss; Its open flowers are like the blush of bliss On lovers' cheeks; the thorns its armor are, And in its centre shines a golden star, As on a favorite's cheek a sequin glows— And thus the garden's favorite is the Rose.’ VII “The master from his open basket shook The roses on my head. The others took Their silver cups, and filling them with wine, Cried, ‘Pledge our singing, Hassan, as we thine!’ But I exclaimed, ‘What is it I have heard? Wine is forbidden by the Prophet's word: Surely, O Friends! ye would not lightly break The laws which bring ye blessing?’ Then they spake: ‘O Poet, learn thou that the law was made For men, and not for poets. Turn thine eye Within, and read the nature there displayed; The gifts thou hast doth Allah's grace deny To common men; they lift thee o'er the rules The Prophet fixed for sinners and for fools. The vine is Nature's poet: from his bloom The air goes reeling, tipsy with perfume, And when the sun is warm within his blood It mounts and sparkles in a crimson flood; Rich with dumb songs he speaks not, till they find Interpretation in the Poet's mind. If Wine be evil, Song is evil too; Then cease thy singing, lest it bring thee sin; But wouldst thou know the strains which Hafiz knew, Drink as he drank, and thus the secret win.’ They clasped my glowing hands; they held the bowl Up to my lips, till, losing all control Of the fierce thirst, which at my scruples laughed, I drained the goblet at a single draught. It ran through every limb like fluid fire: ‘More, O my Friends!’ I cried, the new desire Raging within me: ‘this is life indeed! From blood like this is coined the nobler seed Whence poets are begotten. Drink again, And give us music of a tender strain, Linking your inspiration unto mine, For music hovers on the lips of Wine!’ VIII “‘Music!’ they shouted, echoing my demand, And answered with a beckon of his hand The gracious host, whereat a maiden, fair As the last star that leaves the morning air, Came down the leafy paths. Her veil revealed The beauty of her face, which, half concealed Behind its thin blue folds, showed like the moon Behind a cloud that will forsake it soon. Her hair was braided darkness, but the glance Of lightning eyes shot from her countenance, And showed her neck, that like an ivory tower Rose o'er the twin domes of her marble breast. Were all the beauty of this age compressed Into one form, she would transcend its power. Her step was lighter than the young gazelle's, And as she walked, her anklet's golden bells Tinkled with pleasure, but were quickly mute With jealousy, as from a case she drew With snowy hands the pieces of her lute, And took her seat before me. As it grew To perfect shape, her lovely arms she bent Around the neck of the sweet instrument, Till from her soft caresses it awoke To consciousness, and thus its rapture spoke: ‘I was a tree within an Indian vale, When first I heard the love-sick nightingale Declare his passion: every leaf was stirred With the melodious sorrow of the bird, And when he ceased, the song remained with me. Men came anon, and felled the harmless tree, But from the memory of the songs I heard, The spoiler saved me from the destiny Whereby my brethren perished. O'er the sea I came, and from its loud, tumultuous moan I caught a soft and solemn undertone; And when I grew beneath the maker's hand To what thou seest, he sang (the while he planned) The mirthful measures of a careless heart, And of my soul his songs became a part. Now they have laid my head upon a breast Whiter than marble, I am wholly blest. The fair hands smite me, and my strings complain With such melodious cries, they smite again, Until, with passion and with sorrow swayed, My torment moves the bosom of the maid, Who hears it speak her own. I am the voice Whereby the lovers languish or rejoice; And they caress me, knowing that my strain Alone can speak the language of their pain.’ IX “Here ceased the fingers of the maid to stray Over the strings; the sweet song died away In mellow, drowsy murmurs, and the lute Leaned on her fairest bosom, and was mute. Better than wine that music was to me: Not the lute only felt her hands, but she Played on my heart-strings, till the sounds became Incarnate in the pulses of my frame. Speech left my tongue, and in my tears alone Found utterance. With stretched arms I implored Continuance, whereat her fingers poured A tenderer music, answering the tone Her parted lips released, the while her throat Throbbed, as a heavenly bird were fluttering there, And gave her voice the wonder of his note. ‘His brow,’ she sang, ‘is white beneath his hair; The fertile beard is soft upon his chin, Shading the mouth that nestles warm within, As a rose nestles in its leaves; I see His eyes, but cannot tell what hue they be, For the sharp eyelash, like a sabre, speaks The martial law of Passion; in his cheeks The quick blood mounts, and then as quickly goes, Leaving a tint like marble when a rose Is held inside it:—bid him veil his eyes, Lest all my soul should unto mine arise, And he behold it!’ As she sang, her glance Dwelt on my face; her beauty, like a lance, Transfixed my heart. I melted into sighs, Slain by the arrows of her beauteous eyes. ‘Why is her bosom made’ (I cried) ‘a snare? Why does a single ringlet of her hair Hold my heart captive?’ ‘Would you know?’ she said; ‘It is that you are mad with love, and chains Were made for madmen.’ Then she raised her head With answering love, that led to other strains, Until the lute, which shared with her the smart, Rocked as in storm upon her beating heart. Thus to its wires she made impassioned cries: ‘I swear it by the brightness of his eyes, I swear it by the darkness of his hair; By the warm bloom his limbs and bosom wear; By the fresh pearls his rosy lips enclose; By the calm majesty of his repose; By smiles I coveted, and frowns I feared, And by the shooting myrtles of his beard,— I swear it, that from him the morning drew Its freshness, and the moon her silvery hue, The sun his brightness, and the stars their fire, And musk and camphor all their odorous breath: And if he answer not my love's desire, Day will be night to me, and Life be Death!’ X “Scarce had she ceased, when, overcome, I fell Upon her bosom, where the lute no more That night was cradled; song was silenced well With kisses, each one sweeter than before, Until their fiery dew so long was quaffed, I drank delirium in the infectious draught. The guests departed, but the sounds they made I heard not; in the fountain-haunted shade The lamps burned out; the moon rode far above, But the trees chased her from our nest of love. Dizzy with passion, in mine ears the blood Tingled and hummed in a tumultuous flood, Until from deep to deep I seemed to fall, Like him, who from El Sirat's hair-drawn wall Plunges to endless gulfs. In broken gleams Glimmered the things I saw, so mixed with dreams The vain confusion blinded every sense, And knowledge left me. Then a sleep intense Fell on my brain, and held me as the dead, Until a sudden tumult smote my head, And a strong glare, as when a torch is hurled Before a sleeper's eyes, brought back the world. XI “Most wonderful! The fountain and the trees Had disappeared, and in the place of these I saw the well-known Gate of Victory. The sun was high; the people looked at me, And marvelled that a sleeper should be there On the hot pavement, for the second prayer Was called from all the minarets. I passed My hand across my eyes, and found at last What man I was. Then straightway through my heart There rang a double pang,—the bitter smart Of evil knowledge, and the unhealthy lust Of sinful pleasure; and I threw the dust Upon my head, the burial of my pride,— The ashen soil, wherein I plant the tree Of Penitence. The people saw, and cried, ‘May God reward thee, Hassan! Truly, thou, Whom men have honored, addest to thy brow The crowning lustre of Humility: As thou abasest, God exalteth thee!’ Which when I heard, I shed such tears of shame As might erase the record of my blame, And from that time I have not dared to curse The unrighteous, since the man who seemeth worse Than I, may purer be; for, when I fell Temptation reached a loftier pinnacle. Therefore, O Man! be Charity thy aim: Praise cannot harm, but weigh thy words of blame. Distrust the Virtue that itself exalts, But turn to that which doth avow its faults, And from Repentance plucks a wholesome fruit. Pardon, not Wrath, is God's best attribute.” XII “The tale, O Poet! which thy lips have told,” I said, “is words of rubies set in gold. Precious the wisdom which from evil draws Strength to fulfil the good, of Allah's laws. But lift thy head, O Hassan! Thine own words Shall best console thee, for my tongue affords No phrase but thanks for what thou hast bestowed; And yet I fain would have thee shake the load Of shame from off thy shoulders, seeing still That by this fall thou hast increased thy will To do the work which makes thee truly blest.” Hassan Ben Khaled wept and smote his breast: “Hold! hold, O Man!” he cried: “why make me feel A deeper shame? Why force me to reveal That Sin is as the leprous taint no art Can cleanse the blood from? In my secret heart I do believe I hold at dearer cost The vanished Pleasure, than the Virtue lost.” So saying, he arose and went his way; And Allah grant he go no more astray. 1854. EL KHALIL I am no chieftain, fit to lead Where spears are hurled and warriors bleed; No poet, in my chanted rhyme To rouse the ghosts of ancient time; No magian, with a subtle ken To rule the thoughts of other men; Yet far as sounds the Arab tongue My name is known to old and young. My form has lost its pliant grace, There is no beauty in my face, There is no cunning in my arm, The Children of the Sun to charm; Yet, where I go, my people's eyes Are lighted with a glad surprise, And in each tent a couch is free, And by each fire a place, for me. They watch me from the palms, and some Proclaim my coming ere I come. The children lift my hand to meet The homage of their kisses sweet; With manly warmth the men embrace, The veilèd maidens seek my face, And eyes, fresh kindled from the heart Keep loving watch when I depart. On God, the Merciful, I call, To shed His blessing over all: I praise His name, for He is Great, And Loving, and Compassionate; And for the gift of love I give— The breath of life whereby I live— He gives me back, in overflow, His children's love, where'er I go. Deep sunk in sin the man must be That has no friendly word for me. I pass through tribes whose trade is death, And not a sabre quits the sheath; For strong, and cruel as they prove, The sons of men are weak to Love. The humblest gifts to them I bring; Yet in their hearts I rule, a king. 1853. SONG Daughter of Egypt, veil thine eyes! I cannot bear their fire; Nor will I touch with sacrifice Those altars of Desire. For they are flames that shun the day, And their unholy light Is fed from natures gone astray In passion and in night. The stars of Beauty and of Sin, They burn amid the dark, Like beacons that to ruin win The fascinated bark. Then veil their glow, lest I forswear The hopes thou canst not crown, And in the black waves of thy hair My struggling manhood drown! 1853. AMRAN'S WOOING I You ask, O Frank! how Love is born Within these glowing climes of Morn, Where envious veils conceal the charms That tempt a Western lover's arms, And how, without a voice or sound, From heart to heart the path is found, Since on the eye alone is flung The burden of the silent tongue. You hearken with a doubtful smile Whene'er the wandering bards beguile Our evening indolence with strains Whose words gush molten through our veins,— The songs of Love, but half confessed, Where Passion sobs on Sorrow's breast, And mighty longings, tender fears, Steep the strong heart in fire and tears. The source of each accordant strain Lies deeper than the Poet's brain. First from the people's heart must spring The passions which he learns to sing; They are the wind, the harp is he, To voice their fitful melody,— The language of their varying fate, Their pride, grief, love, ambition, hate,— The talisman which holds inwrought The touchstone of the listener's thought; That penetrates each vain disguise, And brings his secret to his eyes. For, like a solitary bird That hides among the boughs unheard Until some mate, whose carol breaks, Its own betraying song awakes, So, to its echo in those lays, The ardent heart itself betrays. Crowned with a prophet's honor, stands The Poet, on Arabian sands; A chief, whose subjects love his thrall,— The sympathizing heart of all. II Vaunt not your Western maids to me, Whose charms to every gaze are free: My love is selfish, and would share Scarce with the sun, or general air, The sight of beauty which has shone Once for mine eyes, and mine alone. Love likes concealment; he can dress With fancied grace the loveliness That shrinks behind its virgin veil, As hides the moon her forehead pale Behind a cloud, yet leaves the air Softer than if her orb were there. And as the splendor of a star, When sole in heaven, seems brighter far So shines the eye, Love's star and sun, The brighter, that it shines alone. The light from out its darkness sent Is Passion's life and element; And when the heart is warm and young, Let but that single ray be flung Upon its surface, and the deep Heaves from its unsuspecting sleep, As heaves the ocean when its floor Breaks over the volcano's core. Who thinks if cheek or lip be fair? Is not all beauty centred where The soul looks out, the feelings move, And Love his answer gives to love? Look on the sun, and you will find For other sights your eyes are blind. Look—if the colder blood you share Can give your heart the strength to dare— In eyes of dark and tender fire: What more can blinded love desire? III I was a stripling, quick and bold, And rich in pride as poor in gold, When God's good will my journey bent One day to Shekh Abdallah's tent. My only treasure was a steed Of Araby's most precious breed; And whether 't was in boastful whim To show his mettled speed of limb, Or that presumption, which, in sooth, Becomes the careless brow of youth,— Which takes the world as birds the air, And moves in freedom everywhere,— It matters not. But 'midst the tents I rode in easy confidence, Till to Abdallah's door I pressed And made myself the old man's guest. My “Peace be with you!” was returned With the grave courtesy he learned From age and long authority, And in God's name he welcomed me. The pipe replenished, with its stem Of jasmine wood and amber gem, Was at my lips, and while I drew The rosy-sweet, soft vapor through In ringlets of dissolving blue, Waiting his speech with reverence meet, A woman's garments brushed my feet, And first through boyish senses ran The pulse of love which made me man. The handmaid of her father's cheer, With timid grace she glided near, And, lightly dropping on her knee, Held out a silver zerf to me, Within whose cup the fragrance sent From Yemen's sunburnt berries blent With odors of the Persian rose. That picture still in memory glows With the same heat as then,—the gush Of fever, with its fiery flush Startling my blood; and I can see— As she this moment knelt to me— The shrouded graces of her form; The half-seen arm, so round and warm; The little hand, whose tender veins Branched through the henna's orange stains; The head, in act of offering bent; And through the parted veil, which lent A charm for what it hid, the eye, Gazelle-like, large, and dark, and shy That with a soft, sweet tremble shone Beneath the fervor of my own, Yet could not, would not, turn away The fascination of its ray, But half in pleasure, half in fright, Grew unto mine, and builded bright From heart to heart a bridge of light. IV From the fond trouble of my look The zerf within her fingers shook, As with a start, like one who breaks Some happy trance of thought, and wakes Unto forgotten toil, she rose And passed. I saw the curtains close Behind her steps: the light was gone, But in the dark my heart dreamed on. Some random words—thanks ill expressed— I to the stately Shekh addressed, With the intelligence which he, My host, could not demand of me; How, wandering in the desert chase, I spied from far his camping-place, And Arab honor bade me halt To break his bread and share his salt. Thereto, fit reverence for his name, The praise our speech is quick to frame, Which, empty though it seem, was dear To the old warrior's willing ear, And led his thoughts, by many a track, To deeds of ancient prowess back, Until my love could safely hide Beneath the covert of his pride. And when his “Go with God!” was said, Upon El-Azrek's back I sped Into the desert, wide and far, Beneath the silver evening-star, And, fierce with passion, without heed Urged o'er the sands my snorting steed As if those afrites, feared of man,— Who watch the lonely caravan, And, if a loiterer lags behind, Efface its tracks with sudden wind, Then fill the air with cheating cries, An I make false pictures to his eyes Till the bewildered sufferer dies,— Had breathed on me their demon breath And spurred me to the hunt of Death. V Yet madness such as this was worth All the cool wisdom of the earth, And sweeter glowed its wild unrest Than the old calm of brain and breast. The image of that maiden beamed Through all I saw, or thought, or dreamed, Till she became, like Light or Air, A part of life. And she shall share, I vowed, my passion and my fate. Or both shall fail me, soon or late, In the vain effort to possess; For Life lives only in success. I could not, in her father's sight, Purchase the hand which was his right, And well I knew how quick denied The prayer would be to empty pride; But Heaven and Earth shall sooner move Than bar the energy of Love. The sinews of my life became Obedient to that single aim, And desperate deed and patient thought Together in its service wrought. Keen as a falcon, when his eye In search of quarry reads the sky, I stole unseen, at eventide, Behind the well, upon whose side The girls their jars of water leaned. By one long, sandy hillock screened, I watched the forms that went and came, With eyes that sparkled with the flame Up from my heart in flashes sent, As one by one they came and went Amid the sunset radiance cast On the red sands: they came and passed, And she,—thank God!—she came at last! VI Then, while her fair companion bound The cord her pitcher's throat around, And steadied with a careful hand Its slow descent, upon the sand At the Shekh's daughter's feet, I sped A slender arrow, shaft and head With breathing jasmine-flowers entwined, And roses such as on the wind Of evening with rich odors fan The white kiosks of Ispahan. A moment, fired with love and hope, I stayed upon the yellow slope El-Azrek's hoofs, to see her raise Her startled eyes in sweet amaze,— To see her make the unconscious sign Which recognized the gift as mine, And place, before she turned to part, The flowery barb against her heart. VII Again the Shekh's divan I pressed: The jasmine pipe was brought the guest, And Mariam, lovelier than before, Knelt with the steamy cup once more. O bliss! within those eyes to see A soul of love look out on me,— A fount of passion, which is truth In the wild dialect of Youth,— Whose rich abundance is outpoured Like worship at a shrine adored, And on its rising deluge bears The heart to raptures or despairs. While from the cup the zerf contained The foamy amber juice I drained, A rose-bud in the zerf expressed The sweet confession of her breast. One glance of glad intelligence And silently she glided thence. “O Skekh!” I cried, as she withdrew, (Short is the speech where hearts are true,) “Thou hast a daughter; let me be A shield to her, a sword to thee!” Abdallah turned his steady eye Full on my face, and made reply: “It cannot be. The treasure sent By God must not be idly spent. Strong men there are, in service tried, Who seek the maiden for a bride; And shall I slight their worth and truth To feed the passing flame of youth?” VIII “No passing flame!” my answer ran; “But love which is the life of man, Warmed with his blood, fed by his breath, And, when it fails him, leaves but Death. O Shekh, I hoped not thy consent; But having tasted in thy tent An Arab welcome, shared thy bread, I come to warn thee I shall wed Thy daughter, though her suitors be As leaves upon the tamarind-tree. Guard her as thou mayst guard, I swear No other bed than mine shall wear Her virgin honors, and thy race Through me shall keep its ancient place. Thou 'rt warned, and duty bids no more; For, when I next approach thy door, Her child shall intercessor be To build up peace 'twixt thee and me.” A little flushed my boyish brow; But calmly then I spake, as now. The Shekh, with dignity that flung Rebuke on my impetuous tongue, Replied: “The young man's hopes are fair; The young man's blood would all things dare. But age is wisdom, and can bring Confusion on the soaring wing Of reckless youth. Thy words are just, But needless; for I still can trust A father's jealousy to shield From robber grasp the gem concealed Within his tent, till he may yield To fitting hands the precious store. Go, then, in peace; but come no more.” IX My only sequin served to bribe A cunning mother of the tribe To Mariam's mind my plan to bring. A feather of the wild dove's wing, A lock of raven gloss and stain Sheared from El-Azrek's flowing mane And that pale flower whose fragrant cup Is closed until the moon comes up,— But then a tenderer beauty holds Than any flower the sun unfolds,— Declared my purpose. Her reply Let loose the winds of ecstasy: Two roses and the moonlight flower Told the acceptance, and the hour,— Two daily suns to waste their glow, And then, at moonrise, bliss—or woe. X El-Azrek now, on whom alone The burden of our fate was thrown, Claimed from my hands a double meed Of careful training for the deed. I gave him of my choicest store— No guest was ever honored more. With flesh of kid, with whitest bread And dates of Egypt was he fed; The camel's heavy udders gave Their frothy juice his thirst to lave: A charger, groomed with better care, The Sultan never rode to prayer. My burning hope, my torturing fear, I breathed in his sagacious ear; Caressed him as a brother might, Implored his utmost speed in flight, Hung on his neck with many a vow, And kissed the white star on his brow. His large and lustrous eyeball sent A look which made me confident, As if in me some doubt he spied, And met it with a human pride. “Enough: I trust thee. 'T is the hour, And I have need of all thy power. Without a wing, God gives thee wings, And Fortune to thy forelock clings.” XI The yellow moon was rising large Above the Desert's dusky marge, And save the jackal's whining moan, Or distant camel's gurgling groan, And the lamenting monotone Of winds that breathe their vain desire And on the lonely sands expire, A silent charm, a breathless spell, Waited with me beside the well. She is not there,—not yet,—but soon A white robe glimmers in the moon. Her little footsteps make no sound On the soft sand; and with a bound, Where terror, doubt, and love unite To blind her heart to all but flight, Trembling, and panting, and oppressed, She threw herself upon my breast. By Allah! like a bath of flame The seething blood tumultuous came From life's hot centre as I drew Her mouth to mine: our spirits grew Together in one long, long kiss,— One swooning, speechless pulse of bliss, That, throbbing from the heart's core met In the united lips. Oh, yet The eternal sweetness of that draught Renews the thirst with which I quaffed Love's virgin vintage: starry fire Leapt from the twilights of desire, And in the golden dawn of dreams The space grew warm with radiant beams, Which from that kiss streamed o'er a sea Of rapture, in whose bosom we Sank down, and sank eternally. XII Now nerve thy limbs, El-Azrek! Fling Thy head aloft, and like a wing Spread on the wind thy cloudy mane! The hunt is up: their stallions strain The urgent shoulders close behind, And the wide nostril drinks the wind. But thou art, too, of Nedjid's breed, My brother! and the falcon's speed Slant down the storm's advancing line Would laggard be if matched with thine. Still leaping forward, whistling through The moonlight-laden air, we flew; And from the distance, threateningly, Came the pursuer's eager cry, Still forward, forward, stretched our flight Through the long hours of middle night; One after one the followers lagged, And even my faithful Azrek flagged Beneath his double burden, till The streaks of dawn began to fill The East, and freshening in the race, Their goaded horses gained apace. I drew my dagger, cut the girth, Tumbled my saddle to the earth, And clasped with desperate energies My stallion's side with iron knees; While Mariam, clinging to my breast, The closer for that peril pressed. They come! they come! Their shouts we hear, Now faint and far, now fierce and near. O brave El-Azrek! on the track Let not one fainting sinew slack, Or know thine agony of flight Endured in vain! The purple light Of breaking morn has come at last. O joy! the thirty leagues are past; And, gleaming in the sunrise, see, The white tents of the Aneyzee! The warriors of the waste, the foes Of Shekh Abdallah's tribe, are those Whose shelter and support I claim, Which they bestow in Allah's name; While, wheeling back, the baffled few No longer venture to pursue. XIII And now, O Frank! if you would see How soft the eyes that looked on me Through Mariam's silky lashes, scan Those of my little Solyman. And should you marvel if the child His stately grandsire reconciled To that bold theft, when years had brought The golden portion which he sought, And what upon this theme befell, The Shekh himself can better tell. Off the Cape of Good Hope, 1853. A PLEDGE TO HAFIZ Brim the bowls with Shiraz wine! Roses round your temples twine; Brim the bowls with Shiraz wine,— Hafiz pledge we, Bard divine! With the summer warmth that glows In the wine and on the rose, Blushing, fervid, ruby-bright, We shall pledge his name aright. Hafiz, in whose measures move Youth and Beauty, Song and Love,— In his veins the nimble flood Was of wine, and not of blood. All the songs he sang or thought In his brain were never wrought, But like rose-leaves fell apart From that bursting rose, his heart. Youth is morning's transient ray; Love consumes itself away; Time destroys what Beauty gives; But in Song the Poet lives. While we pledge him—thus—and thus— He is present here in us; 'Tis his voice that cries, not mine: Brim the bowls with Shiraz wine! 1852. THE GARDEN OF IREM I Have you seen the Garden of Irem? No mortal knoweth the road thereto. Find me a path in the mists that gather When the sunbeams scatter the morning dew, And I will lead you thither. Give me a key to the halls of the sun When he goes behind the purple sea, Or a wand to open the vaults that run Down to the afrite-guarded treasures, And I will open its doors to thee. Who hath tasted its countless pleasures? Who hath breathed, in its winds of spice, Raptures deeper than Paradise? Who hath trodden its ivory floors, Where the fount drops pearls from a golden shell, And heard the hinges of diamond doors Swing to the music of Israfel? Its roses blossom, its palms arise, By the phantom stream that flows so fair Under the Desert's burning skies. Can you reach that flood, can you drink its tide, Can you swim its waves to the farther side, Your feet may enter there. II I have seen the Garden of Irem. I found it, but I sought it not: Without a path, without a guide, I found the enchanted spot: Without a key its golden gate stood wide. I was young, and strong, and bold, and free As the milk-white foal of the Nedjidee, And the blood in my veins was like sap of the vine, That stirs, and mounts, and will not stop Till the breathing blossoms that bring the wine Have drained its balm to the last sweet drop. Lance and barb were all I knew, Till deep in the Desert the spot I found, Where the marvellous gates of Irem threw Their splendors over an unknown ground. Mine were the pearl and ivory floors, Mine the music of diamond doors, Turning each on a newer glory: Mine were the roses whose bloom outran The spring-time beauty of Gulistan, And the fabulous flowers of Persian story. Mine were the palms of silver stems, And blazing emerald for diadems; The fretted arch and the gossamer wreath, So light and frail you feared to breathe; Yet o'er them rested the pendent spars Of domes bespangled with silver stars, And crusted gems of rare adorning: And ever higher, like a shaft of fire, The lessening links of the golden spire Flamed in the myriad-colored morning! Like one who lies on the marble lip Of the blessed bath in a tranquil rest, And stirs not even a finger's tip Lest the beatific dream should slip, So did I lie in Irem's breast. Sweeter than Life and stronger than Death Was every draught of that blissful breath; Warmer than summer came its glow To the youthful heart in a mighty flood, And sent its bold and generous blood To water the world in its onward flow. There, where the Garden of Irem lies, Are the roots of the Tree of Paradise, And happy are they who sit below, When into this world of Strife and Death The blossoms are shaken by Allah's breath. Granada, 1852. THE WISDOM OF ALI AN ARAB LEGEND The Prophet once, sitting in calm debate, Said: “I am Wisdom's fortress; but the gate Thereof is Ali.” Wherefore, some who heard, With unbelieving jealousy were stirred; And, that they might on him confusion bring, Ten of the boldest joined to prove the thing. “Let us in turn to Ali go,” they said, “And ask if Wisdom should be sought instead Of earthly riches; then, if he reply To each of us, in thought, accordantly, And yet to none, in speech or phrase, the same, His shall the honor be, and ours the shame.” Now, when the first his bold demand did make, These were the words which Ali straightway spake:— “Wisdom is the inheritance of those Whom Allah favors; riches, of his foes.” Unto the second he said: “Thyself must be Guard to thy wealth; but Wisdom guardeth thee.” Unto the third: “By Wisdom wealth is won; But riches purchased wisdom yet for none.” Unto the fourth: “Thy goods the thief may take; But into Wisdom's house he cannot break.” Unto the fifth: “Thy goods decrease the more Thou giv'st; but use enlarges Wisdom's store.” Unto the sixth: “Wealth tempts to evil ways; But the desire of Wisdom is God's praise.” Unto the seventh: “Divide thy wealth, each part Becomes a pittance. Give with open heart “Thy wisdom, and each separate gift shall be All that thou hast, yet not impoverish thee.” Unto the eighth: “Wealth cannot keep itself; But Wisdom is the steward even of pelf.” Unto the ninth: “The camels slowly bring Thy goods; but Wisdom has the swallow's wing.” And lastly, when the tenth did question make, These were the ready words which Ali spake:— “Wealth is a darkness which the soul should fear; But Wisdom is the lamp that makes it clear.” Crimson with shame the questioners withdrew, And they declared: “The Prophet's words were true; The mouth of Ali is the golden door Of Wisdom.” When his friends to Ali bore These words, he smiled and said: “And should they ask The same until my dying day, the task Were easy; for the stream from Wisdom's well, Which God supplies, is inexhaustible.” 1854. AN ORIENTAL IDYL A silver javelin which the hills Have hurled upon the plain below, The fleetest of the Pharpar's rills, Beneath me shoots in flashing flow. I hear the never-ending laugh Of jostling waves that come and go, And suck the bubbling pipe, and quaff The sherbet cooled in mountain snow. The flecks of sunshine gleam like stars Beneath the canopy of shade; And in the distant, dim bazaars I scarcely hear the hum of trade. No evil fear, no dream forlorn, Darkens my heaven of perfect blue; My blood is tempered to the morn,— My very heart is steeped in dew. What Evil is I cannot tell; But half I guess what Joy may be; And, as a pearl within its shell, The happy spirit sleeps in me. I feel no more the pulse's strife,— The tides of Passion's ruddy sea,— But live the sweet, unconscious life That breathes from yonder jasmine tree. Upon the glittering pageantries Of gay Damascus' streets I look As idly as a babe that sees The painted pictures of a book. Forgotten now are name and race; The Past is blotted from my brain; For Memory sleeps, and will not trace The weary pages o'er again. I only know the morning shines, And sweet the dewy morning air; But does it play with tendrilled vines? Or does it lightly lift my hair? Deep-sunken in the charmed repose, This ignorance is bliss extreme: And whether I be Man, or Rose, Oh, pluck me not from out my dream! 1854. BEDOUIN SONG From the Desert I come to thee On a stallion shod with fire; And the winds are left-behind In the speed of my desire. Under thy window I stand, And the midnight hears my cry: I love thee, I love but thee, With a love that shall not die Till the sun grows cold, And the stars are old, And the leaves of the Judgment Book unfold! Look from thy window and see My passion and my pain; I lie on the sands below, And I faint in thy disdain. Let the night-winds touch thy brow With the heat of my burning sigh, And melt thee to hear the vow Of a love that shall not die Till the sun grows cold, And the stars are old, And the leaves of the Judgment Book unfold! My steps are nightly driven, By the fever in my breast, To hear from thy lattice breathed The word that shall give me rest. Open the door of thy heart, And open thy chamber door, And my kisses shall teach thy lips The love that shall fade no more Till the sun grows cold, And the stars are old, And the leaves of the Judgment Book unfold! Mozambique Channel, 1853. DESERT HYMN TO THE SUN I Under the arches of the morning sky, Save in one heart, there beats no life of Man; The yellow sand-hills bleak and trackless lie, And far behind them sleeps the caravan. A silence, as before Creation, broods Sublimely o'er the desert solitudes. II A silence as if God in Heaven were still, And meditating some new wonder! Earth And Air the solemn portent own, and thrill With awful prescience of the coming birth. And Night withdraws, and on their silver cars Wheel to remotest space the trembling Stars. III See! an increasing brightness, broad and fleet, Breaks on the morning in a rosy flood, As if He smiled to see His work complete, And rested from it, and pronounced it good. The sands lie still, and every wind is furled: The Sun comes up, and looks upon the world. IV Is there no burst of music to proclaim The pomp and majesty of this new lord?— A golden trumpet in each beam of flame, Startling the universe with grand accord? Must Earth be dumb beneath the splendors thrown From his full orb to glorify her own? V No: with an answering splendor, more than sound Instinct with gratulation, she adores. With purple flame the porphyry hills are crowned, And burn with gold the Desert's boundless floors; And the lone Man compels his haughty knee, And, prostrate at thy footstool, worships thee. VI Before the dreadful glory of thy face; He veils his sight: he fears the fiery rod Which thou dost wield amid the brightening space, As if the sceptre of a visible god. If not the shadow of God's lustre, thou Art the one jewel flaming on His brow. VII Wrap me within the mantle of thy beams, And feed my pulses with thy keenest fire! Here, where thy full meridian deluge streams Across the Desert, let my blood aspire To ripen in the vigor of thy blaze, And catch a warmth to shine through darker days! VIII I am alone before thee: Lord of Light! Begetter of the life of things that live! Beget in me thy calm, self-balanced might; To me thine own immortal ardor give. Yea, though, like her who gave to Jove her charms, My being wither in thy fiery arms. IX Whence came thy splendors? Heaven is filled with thee; The sky's blue walls are dazzling with thy train; Thou sitt'st alone in the Immensity, And in thy lap the World grows young again. Bathed in such brightness, drunken with the Day, He deems the Dark forever passed away. X But thou dost sheathe thy trenchant sword, and lean With tempered grandeur towards the western gate; Shedding thy glory with a brow serene, And leaving heaven all golden with thy state: Not as a king discrowned and overthrown, But one who keeps, and shall reclaim his own. Indian Ocean, 1853. NILOTIC DRINKING SONG I You may water your bays, brother-poets, with lays That brighten the cup from the stream you doat on. By the Schuylkill's side, or Cochituate's tide, Or the crystal lymph of the mountain Croton: (We may pledge from these In our summer ease, Nor even Anacreon's shade revile us—) But I, from the flood Of his own brown blood, Will drink to the glory of ancient Nilus! II Cloud never gave birth, nor cradle the Earth, To river so grand and fair as this is: Not the waves that roll us the gold of Pactolus, Nor cool Cephissus, nor classic Ilissus. The lily may dip Her ivory lip To kiss the ripples of clear Eurotas; But the Nile brings balm From the myrrh and palm, And the ripe, voluptuous lips of the lotus. III The waves that ride on his mighty tide Were poured from the urns of unvisited mountains; And their sweets of the South mingle cool in the mouth With the freshness and sparkle of Northern fountains. Again and again The goblet we drain.— Diviner a stream never Nereid swam on: For Isis and Orus Have quaffed before us, And Ganymede dipped it for Jupiter Ammon. IV Its blessing he pours o'er his thirsty shores, And floods the regions of Sleep and Silence, When he makes oases in desert places, And the plain is a sea, the hills are islands. And had I the brave Anacreon's stave, And lips like the honeyed lips of Hylas, I 'd dip from his brink My bacchanal drink, And sing for the glory of ancient Nilus! Nile, Ethiopia, 1852. CAMADEVA The sun, the moon, the mystic planets seven, Shone with a purer and serener flame, And there was joy on Earth and joy in Heaven When Camadeva came. The blossoms burst, like jewels of the air, Putting the colors of the morn to shame; Breathing their odorous secrets everywhere When Camadeva came. The birds, upon the tufted tamarind spray, Sat side by side and cooed in amorous blame; The lion sheathed his claws and left his prey When Camadeva came. The sea slept, pillowed on the happy shore; The mountain-peaks were bathed in rosy flame; The clouds went down the sky,—to mount no more When Camadeva came. The hearts of all men brightened like the morn; The poet's harp then first deserved its fame, For rapture sweeter than he sang was born When Camadeva came. All breathing life a newer spirit quaffed A second life, a bliss beyond a name, And Death, half-conquered, dropped his idle shaft When Camadeva came. India, 1853. NUBIA A land of Dreams and Sleep,—a poppied land! With skies of endless calm above her head, The drowsy warmth of summer noonday shed Upon her hills, and silence stern and grand Throughout her Desert's temple-burying sand. Before her threshold, in their ancient place, With closèd lips, and fixed, majestic face Noteless of Time, her dumb colossi stand. Oh, pass them not with light, irreverent tread; Respect the dream that builds her fallen throne, And soothes her to oblivion of her woes. Hush! for she does but sleep; she is not dead: Action and Toil have made the world their own, But she hath built an altar to Repose. 1853. KILIMANDJARO I Hail to thee, monarch of African mountains, Remote, inaccessible, silent, and lone,— Who, from the heart of the tropical fervors, Liftest to heaven thine alien snows, Feeding forever the fountains that make thee Father of Nile and Creator of Egypt! II The years of the world are engraved on thy forehead; Time's morning blushed red on thy first-fallen snows; Yet, lost in the wilderness, nameless, unnoted, Of Man unbeholden, thou wert not till now. Knowledge alone is the being of Nature, Giving a soul to her manifold features, Lighting through paths of the primitive darkness The footsteps of Truth and the vision of Song. Knowledge has born thee anew to Creation, And long-baffled Time at thy baptism rejoices. Take, then, a name, and be filled with existence, Yea, be exultant in sovereign glory, While from the hand of the wandering poet Drops the first garland of song at thy feet. III Floating alone, on the flood of thy making, Through Africa's mystery, silence, and fire, Lo! in my palm, like the Eastern enchanter, I dip from the waters a magical mirror, And thou art revealed to my purified vision. I see thee, supreme in the midst of thy co-mates, Standing alone 'twixt the Earth and the Heavens, Heir of the Sunset and Herald of Morn. Zone above zone, to thy shoulders of granite, The climates of Earth are displayed, as an index, Giving the scope of the Book of Creation. There, in the gorges that widen, descending From cloud and from cold into summer eternal, Gather the threads of the ice-gendered fountains,— Gather to riotous torrents of crystal, And, giving each shelvy recess where they dally The blooms of the North and its evergreen turfage, Leap to the land of the lion and lotus! There, in the wondering airs of the Tropics Shivers the Aspen, still dreaming of cold: There stretches the Oak, from the loftiest ledges, His arms to the far-away lands of his brothers, And the Pine-tree looks down on his rival, the Palm. IV Bathed in the tenderest purple of distance, Tinted and shadowed by pencils of air, Thy battlements hang o'er the slopes and the forests, Seats of the Gods in the limitless ether, Looming sublimely aloft and afar. Above them, like folds of imperial ermine, Sparkle the snow-fields that furrow thy forehead,— Desolate realms, inaccessible, silent. Chasms and caverns where Day is a stranger, Garners where storeth his treasures the Thunder, The Lightning his falchion, his arrows the Hail! V Sovereign Mountain, thy brothers give welcome: They, the baptized and the crownèd of ages, Watch-towers of Continents, altars of Earth, Welcome thee now to their mighty assembly. Mont Blanc, in the roar of his mad avalanches, Hails thy accession; superb Orizaba, Belted with beech and ensandalled with palm; Chimborazo, the lord of the regions of noonday,— Mingle their sounds in magnificent chorus With greeting august from the Pillars of Heaven, Who, in the urns of the Indian Ganges Filter the snows of their sacred dominions, Unmarked with a footprint, unseen but of God. VI Lo! unto each is the seal of his lordship, Nor questioned the right that his majesty giveth: Each in his lawful supremacy forces Worship and reverence, wonder and joy. Absolute all, yet in dignity varied, None has a claim to the honors of story, Or the superior splendors of song, Greater than thou, in thy mystery mantled,— Thou, the sole monarch of African mountains, Father of Nile and Creator of Egypt! White Nile, 1852. THE BIRTH OF THE PROPHET I Thrice three moons had waxed in heaven, thrice three moons had waned away, Since Abdullah, faint and thirsty, on the Desert's bosom lay In the fiery lap of Summer, the meridian of the day;— II Since from out the sand upgushing, lo! a sudden fountain leapt; Sweet as musk and clear as amber, to his parching lips it crept. When he drank it straightway vanished, but his blood its virtue kept. III Ere the morn his forehead's lustre, signet of the Prophet's line, To the beauty of Amina had transferred its flame divine; Of the germ within her sleeping, such the consecrated sign. IV And with every moon that faded waxed the splendor more and more, Till Amina's beauty lightened through the matron veil she wore, And the tent was filled with glory, and of Heaven it seemed the door. V When her quickened womb its burden had matured, and Life began Struggling in its living prison, through the wide Creation rang Premonitions of the coming of a God-appointed man. VI For the oracles of Nature recognize a Prophet's birth,— Blossom of the tardy ages, crowning type of human worth,— And by miracles and wonders he is welcomed to the Earth. VII Then the stars in heaven grew brighter, stooping downward from their zones; Wheeling round the towers of Mecca, sang the moon in silver tones, And the Kaaba's grisly idols trembled on their granite thrones. VIII Mighty arcs of rainbow splendor, pillared shafts of purple fire, Split the sky and spanned the darkness, and with many a golden spire, Beacon-like, from all the mountains streamed the lambent meteors higher. IX But when first the breath of being to the sacred infant came, Paled the pomp of airy lustre, and the stars grew dim with shame, For the glory of his countenance outshone their feebler flame. X Over Nedjid's sands it lightened, unto Oman's coral deep, Startling all the gorgeous regions of the Orient from sleep, Till, a sun on night new-risen, it illumed the Indian steep. XI They who dwelt in Mecca's borders saw the distant realms appear All around the vast horizon, shining marvellous and clear, From the gardens of Damascus unto those of Bendemeer. XII From the colonnades of Tadmor to the hills of Hadramaut, Ancient Araby was lighted, and her sands the splendor caught, Till the magic sweep of vision overtook the track of Thought. XIII Such on Earth the wondrous glory, but beyond the sevenfold skies God His mansions filled with gladness, and the seraphs saw arise Palaces of pearl and ruby from the founts of Paradise. XIV As the surge of heavenly anthems shook the solemn midnight air, From the shrines of false religions came a wailing of despair, And the fires on Pagan altars were extinguished everywhere. XV 'Mid the sounds of salutation, 'mid the splendor and the balm, Knelt the sacred child, proclaiming, with a brow of heavenly calm: “God is God; there is none other; I his chosen Prophet am!” Indian Ocean, 1853. TO THE NILE Mysterious Flood,—that through the silent sands Hast wandered, century on century, Watering the length of great Egyptian lands, Which were not, but for thee,— Art thou the keeper of that eldest lore, Written ere yet thy hieroglyphs began When dawned upon thy fresh, untrampled shore The earliest life of Man? Thou guardest temple and vast pyramid Where the gray Past records its ancient speech; But in thine unrevealing breast lies hid What they refuse to teach. All other streams with human joys and fears Run blended, o'er the plains of History: Thou tak'st no note of Man; a thousand years Are as a day to thee. What were to thee the Osirian festivals? Or Memnon's music on the Theban plain? The carnage, when Cambyses made thy halls Ruddy with royal slain? Even then thou wast a God, and shrines were built For worship of thine own majestic flood; For thee the incense burned,—for thee was spilt The sacrificial blood. And past the bannered pylons that arose Above thy palms, the pageantry and state, Thy current flowed, calmly as now it flows, Unchangeable as Fate. Thou givest blessing as a God might give, Whose being is his bounty: from the slime Shaken from off thy skirts the nations live, Through all the years of Time. In thy solemnity, thine awful calm, Thy grand indifference of Destiny, My soul forgets its pain, and drinks the balm Which thou dost proffer me. Thy godship is unquestioned still: I bring No doubtful worship to thy shrine supreme; But thus my homage as a chaplet fling, To float upon thy stream! 1854. HASSAN TO HIS MARE Come, my beauty! come, my desert darling! On my shoulder lay thy glossy head! Fear not, though the barley-sack be empty, Here's the half of Hassan's scanty bread. Thou shalt have thy share of dates, my beauty! And thou know'st my water-skin is free: Drink and welcome, for the wells are distant, And my strength and safety lie in thee. Bend thy forehead now, to take my kisses! Lift in love thy dark and splendid eye: Thou art glad when Hassan mounts the saddle,— Thou art proud he owns thee: so am I. Let the Sultan bring his boasted horses, Prancing with their diamond-studded reins; They, my darling, shall not match thy fleetness When they course with thee the desert-plains! Let the Sultan bring his famous horses, Let him bring his golden swords to me,— Bring his slaves, his eunuchs, and his harem; He would offer them in vain for thee. We have seen Damascus, O my beauty! And the splendor of the Pashas there: What 's their pomp and riches? Why, I would not Take them for a handful of thy hair! Khaled sings the praises of his mistress, And, because I 've none, he pities me. What care I if he should have a thousand, Fairer than the morning? I have thee. He will find his passion growing cooler, Should her glance on other suitors fall; Thou wilt ne'er, my mistress and my darling, Fail to answer at thy master's call. By and by some snow-white Nedjid stallion Shall to thee his spring-time ardor bring: And a foal, the fairest of the Desert, To thy milky dugs shall crouch and cling. Then, when Khaled shows to me his children, I shall laugh, and bid him look at thine; Thou wilt neigh, and lovingly caress me, With thy glossy neck laid close to mine. 1854. CHARMIAN I O Daughter of the Sun; Who gave the keys of passion unto thee? Who taught the powerful sorcery Wherein my soul, too willing to be won, Still feebly struggles to be free, But more than half undone? Within the mirror of thine eyes, Full of the sleep of warm Egyptian skies,— The sleep of lightning, bound in airy spell, And deadlier, because invisible,— I see the reflex of a feeling Which was not, till I looked on thee: A power, involved in mystery, That shrinks, affrighted, from its own revealing. II Thou sitt'st in stately indolence, Too calm to feel a breath of passion start The listless fibres of thy sense, The fiery slumber of thy heart. Thine eyes are wells of darkness, by the veil Of languid lids half-sealed: the pale And bloodless olive of thy face, And the full, silent lips that wear A ripe serenity of grace, Are dark beneath the shadow of thy hair. Not from the brow of templed Athor beams Such tropic warmth along the path of dreams; Not from the lips of hornèd Isis flows Such sweetness of repose! For thou art Passion's self, a goddess too, And aught but worship never knew; And thus thy glances, calm and sure, Look for accustomed homage, and betray No effort to assert thy sway: Thou deem'st my fealty secure. III O Sorceress! those looks unseal The undisturbèd mysteries that press Too deep in nature for the heart to feel Their terror and their loveliness. Thine eyes are torches that illume On secret shrines their unforeboded fires, And fill the vaults of silence and of gloom With the unresting life of new desires. I follow where their arrowy ray Pierces the veil I would not tear away, And with a dread, delicious awe behold Another gate of life unfold, Like the rapt neophyte who sees Some march of grand Osirian mysteries. The startled chambers I explore, And every entrance open lies, Forced by the magic thrill that runs before Thy slowly-lifted eyes. I tremble to the centre of my being Thus to confess the spirit's poise o'erthrown, And all its guiding virtues blown Like leaves before the whirlwind's fury fleeing. IV But see! one memory rises in my soul, And, beaming steadily and clear, Scatters the lurid thunder-clouds that roll Through Passion's sultry atmosphere. An alchemy more potent borrow For thy dark eyes, enticing Sorceress! For on the casket of a sacred Sorrow Their shafts fall powerless. Nay, frown not, Athor, from thy mystic shrine: Strong Goddess of Desire, I will not be One of the myriad slaves thou callest thine, To cast my manhood's crown of royalty Before thy dangerous beauty: I am free! East Indies, 1853. SMYRNA The “Ornament of Asia” and the “Crown Of fair Ionia.” Yea; but Asia stands No more an empress, and Ionia's hands Have lost their sceptre. Thou, majestic town, Art as a diamond on a faded robe: The freshness of thy beauty scatters yet The radiance of that sun of Empire set, Whose disk sublime illumed the ancient globe. Thou sitt'st between the mountains and the sea; The sea and mountains flatter thine array, And fill thy courts with Grandeur, not Decay; And Power, not Death, proclaims thy cypress tree. Through thee, the sovereign symbols Nature lent Her rise, make Asia's fall magnificent. 1851. TO A PERSIAN BOY IN THE BAZAAR AT SMYRNA The gorgeous blossoms of that magic tree Beneath whose shade I sat a thousand nights, Breathed from their opening petals all delights Embalmed in spice of Orient Poesy, When first, young Persian, I beheld thine eyes, And felt the wonder of thy beauty grow Within my brain, as some fair planet's glow Deepens, and fills the summer evening skies. From under thy dark lashes shone on me The rich, voluptuous soul of Eastern land, Impassioned, tender, calm, serenely sad,— Such as immortal Hafiz felt when he Sang by the fountain-streams of Rocnabad, Or in the bowers of blissful Samarcand. 1851. THE ARAB TO THE PALM Next to thee, O fair gazelle, O Beddowee girl, beloved so well; Next to the fearless Nedjidee, Whose fleetness shall bear me again to thee; Next to ye both I love the Palm, With his leaves of beauty, his fruit of balm; Next to ye both I love the Tree Whose fluttering shadow wraps us three With love, and silence, and mystery! Our tribe is many, our poets vie With any under the Arab sky; Yet none can sing of the Palm but I. The marble minarets that begem Cairo's citadel-diadem Are not so light as his slender stem. He lifts his leaves in the sunbeam's glance As the Almehs lift their arms in dance,— A slumberous motion, a passionate sign, That works in the cells of the blood like wine. Full of passion and sorrow is he, Dreaming where the beloved may be. And when the warm south-winds arise, He breathes his longing in fervid sighs,— Quickening odors, kisses of balm, That drop in the lap of his chosen palm. The sun may flame and the sands may stir, But the breath of his passion reaches her. O Tree of Love, by that love of thine, Teach me how I shall soften mine! Give me the secret of the sun, Whereby the wooed is ever won! If I were a King, O stately Tree, A likeness, glorious as might be, In the court of my palace I'd build for thee! With a shaft of silver, burnished bright, And leaves of beryl and malachite; With spikes of golden bloom ablaze, And fruits of topaz and chrysoprase: And there the poets, in thy praise, Should night and morning frame new lays,— New measures sung to tunes divine, But none, O Palm, should equal mine! Off Japan, 1853. AURUM POTABILE I Brother Bards of every region,— Brother Bards, (your name is Legion!) Were you with me while the twilight Darkens up my pine-tree skylight,— Were you gathered, representing Every land beneath the sun, O, what songs would be indited, Ere the earliest star is lighted, To the praise of vino d'oro, On the Hills of Lebanon! II Yes; while all alone I quaff its Lucid gold, and brightly laugh its Topaz waves and amber bubbles, Still the thought my pleasure troubles, That I quaff it all alone. O for Hafiz,—glorious Persian! Keats, with buoyant, gay diversion Mocking Schiller's grave immersion; O for wreathed Anacreon! Yet enough to have the living,— They, the few, the rapture-giving! (Blessèd more than in receiving,) Fate, that frowns when laurels wreathe them, Once the solace might bequeath them, Once to taste of vino d'oro On the Hills of Lebanon! III Lebanon, thou mount of story, Well we know thy sturdy glory, Since the days of Solomon; Well we know the Five old Cedars, Scarred by ages,—silent pleaders, Preaching, in their gray sedateness, Of thy forest's fallen greatness, Of the vessels of the Tyrian, And the palaces Assyrian, And the temple on Moriah To the High and Holy One! Know the wealth of thy appointment,— Myrrh and aloes, gum and ointment; But we knew not, till we clomb thee, Of the nectar dropping from thee,— Of the pure, pellucid Ophir In the cups of vino d'oro, On the Hills of Lebanon! IV We have drunk, and we have eaten, Where Egyptian sheaves are beaten; Tasted Judah's milk and honey On his mountains, bare and sunny; Drained ambrosial bowls, that ask us Never more to leave Damascus; And have sung a vintage pæan To the grapes of isles Ægean, And the flasks of Orvieto, Ripened in the Roman sun: But the liquor here surpasses All that beams in earthly glasses. 'Tis of this that Paracelsus (His elixir vitæ) tells us, That to happier shores can float us Than Lethean stems of lotus, And the vigor of the morning Straight restores when day is done. Then, before the sunset waneth, While the rosy tide, that staineth Earth, and sky, and sea, remaineth, We will take the fortune proffered,— Ne'er again to be re-offered, We will drink of vino d'oro, On the Hills of Lebanon! Vino d'oro! vino d'oro!— Golden blood of Lebanon! 1853. ON THE SEA The splendor of the sinking moon Deserts the silent bay; The mountain-isles loom large and faint, Folded in shadows gray, And the lights of land are setting stars That soon will pass away. O boatman, cease thy mellow song! O minstrel, drop thy lyre! Let us hear the voice of the midnight sea, Let us speak as the waves inspire, While the plashy dip of the languid oar Is a furrow of silver fire. Day cannot make thee half so fair, Nor the stars of eve so dear: The arms that clasp and the breast that keeps, They tell me thou art near, And the perfect beauty of thy face In thy murmured words I hear. The lights of land have dropped below The vast and glimmering sea; The world we leave is a tale that is told,— A fable that cannot be. There is no life in the sphery dark But the love in thee and me! Macao, 1853. TYRE I The wild and windy morning is lit with lurid fire; The thundering surf of ocean beats on the rocks of Tyre,— Beats on the fallen columns and round the headland roars, And hurls its foamy volume along the hollow shores, And calls with hungry clamor, that speaks its long desire: “Where are the ships of Tarshish, the mighty ships of Tyre?” II Within her cunning harbor, choked with invading sand, No galleys bring their freightage, the spoils of every land, And like a prostrate forest, when autumn gales have blown, Her colonnades of granite lie shattered and o'erthrown; And from the reef the pharos no longer flings its fire, To beacon home from Tarshish the lordly ships of Tyre. III Where is thy rod of empire, once mighty on the waves,— Thou that thyself exalted, till Kings bacame thy slaves? Thou that didst speak to nations, and saw thy will obeyed,— Whose favor made them joyful, whose anger sore afraid,— Who laid'st thy deep foundations, and thought them strong and sure. And boasted midst the waters, Shall I not aye endure? IV Where is the wealth of ages that heaped thy princely mart? The pomp of purple trappings; the gems of Syrian art; The silken goats of Kedar; Sabæa's spicy store; The tributes of the islands thy squadrons homeward bore, When in thy gates triumphant they entered from the sea With sound of horn and sackbut, of harp and psaltery? V Howl, howl, ye ships of Tarshish! the glory is laid waste: There is no habitation; the mansions are defaced. No mariners of Sidon unfurl your mighty sails; No workmen fell the fir-trees that grow in Shenir's vales And Bashan's oaks that boasted a thousand years of sun, Or hew the masts of cedar on frosty Lebanon. VI Rise, thou forgotten harlot! take up thy harp and sing: Call the rebellious islands to own their ancient king: Bare to the spray thy bosom, and with thy hair unbound, Sit on the piles of ruin, thou throneless and discrowned! There mix thy voice of wailing with the thunders of the sea, And sing thy songs of sorrow, that thou remembered be! VII Though silent and forgotten, yet Nature still laments The pomp and power departed, the lost magnificence: The hills were proud to see thee, and they are sadder now; The sea was proud to bear thee, and wears a troubled brow, And evermore the surges chant forth their vain desire: “Where are the ships of Tarshish, the mighty ships of Tyre?” Indian Ocean, 1853. AN ANSWER You call me cold: you wonder why The marble of a mien like mine Gives fiery sparks of Poesy, Or softens at Love's touch divine. Go, look on Nature, you will find It is the rock that feels the sun: But you are blind,—and to the blind The touch of ice and fire is one. 1852. GULISTAN AN ARABIC METRE Where is Gulistan, the Land of Roses? Not on hills where Northern winters Break their spears in icy splinters, And in shrouded snow the world reposes; But amid the glow and splendor Which the Orient summers lend her, Blue the heaven above her beauty closes: There is Gulistan, the Land of Roses. Northward stand the Persian mountains; Southward spring the silver fountains Which to Hafiz taught his sweetest measures, Clearly ringing to the singing Which the nightingales delight in, When the spring, from Oman winging Unto Shiraz, showers her fragrant treasures On the land, till valleys brighten, Mountains lighten with returning Fires of scarlet poppy burning, And the stream meanders Through its roseate oleanders, And Love's golden gate, unfolden, Opens on a universe of pleasures. There the sunshine blazes over Meadows gemmed with ruby clover; There the rose's heart uncloses, Prodigal with hoarded stores of sweetness, And the lily's cup so still is Where the river's waters quiver, That no wandering air can spill his Honeyed balm, or blight his beauty's fleetness. Skies are fairest, days are rarest,— Thou, O Earth! a glory wearest From the ecstasy thou bearest, Once to feel the Summer's full completeness. Twilight glances, moonlit dances, Song by starlight, there entrances Youthful hearts with fervid fancies, And the blushing rose of Love uncloses: Love that, lapped in summer joyance, Far from every rude annoyance, Calmly on the answering love reposes; And in song, in music only Speaks the longing, vague and lonely, Which to pain is there the nearest, Yet of joys the sweetest, dearest, As a cloud when skies are clearest On its folds intenser light discloses: This is Gulistan, the Land of Roses. 1853. L'ENVOI Unto the Desert and the Desert steed Farewell! The journey is completed now: Struck are the tents of Ishmael's wandering breed, And I unwind the turban from my brow. The sun has ceased to shine; the palms that bent, Inebriate with light, have disappeared; And naught is left me of the Orient But the tanned bosom and the unshorn beard. Yet from that life my blood a glow retains, As the red sunshine in the ruby glows; These songs are echoes of its fiercer strains,— Dreams, that recall its passion and repose. I found, among those Children of the Sun, The cipher of my nature,—the release Of baffled powers, which else had never won That free fulfilment, whose reward is peace. For not to any race or any clime Is the completed sphere of life revealed; He who would make his own that round sublime, Must pitch his tent on many a distant field. Upon his home a dawning lustre beams, But through the world he walks to open day, Gathering from every land the prismal gleams, Which, when united, form the perfect ray. Go, therefore, Songs!—which in the East were born And drew your nurture—from your sire's control: Haply to wander through the West forlorn, Or find a shelter in some Orient soul. And if the temper of our colder sky Less warmth of passion and of speech demands, They are the blossoms of my life,—and I Have ripened in the suns of many lands. 1854.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LATER POEMS LYRICS 1854–1860 PORPHYROGENITUS I Born in the purple! born in the purple! Heir to the sceptre and crown! Lord over millions and millions of vassals,— Monarch of mighty renown! Where, do you ask, are my banner-proud castles? Where my imperial town? II Where are the ranks of my far-flashing lances,— Trumpets, courageous of sound,— Galloping squadrons and rocking armadas, Guarding my kingdom around? Where are the pillars that blazon my borders, Threatening the alien ground? III Vainly you ask, if you wear not the purple, Sceptre and diadem own; Ruling, yourself, over prosperous regions, Seated supreme on your throne. Subjects have nothing to give but allegiance: Monarchs meet monarchs alone. IV But, if a king, you shall stand on my ramparts, Look on the lands that I sway, Number the domes of magnificent cities, Shining in valleys away,— Number the mountains whose foreheads are golden, Lakes that are azure with day. V Whence I inherited such a dominion? What was my forefathers' line? Homer and Sophocles, Pindar and Sappho, First were anointed divine: Theirs were the realms that a god might have governed, Ah, and how little is mine! VI Hafiz in Orient shared with Petrarca Thrones of the East and the West; Shakespeare succeeded to limitless empire, Greatest of monarchs, and best: Few of his children inherited kingdoms, Provinces only, the rest. VII Keats has his vineyards, and Shelley his islands; Coleridge in Xanadu reigns; Wordsworth is eyried aloft on the mountains, Goethe has mountains and plains; Yet, though the world has been parcelled among them, A world to be parcelled remains. VIII Blessing enough to be born in the purple, Though but a monarch in name,— Though in the desert my palace is builded, Far from the highways of Fame: Up with my standards! salute me with trumpets! Crown me with regal acclaim! 1855. THE SONG OF THE CAMP “Give us a song!” the soldiers cried, The outer trenches guarding, When the heated guns of the camps allied Grew weary of bombarding. The dark Redan, in silent scoff, Lay, grim and threatening, under; And the tawny mound of the Malakoff No longer belched its thunder. There was a pause. A guardsman said “We storm the forts to-morrow; Sing while we may, another day Will bring enough of sorrow.” They lay along the battery's side, Below the smoking cannon: Brave hearts, from Severn and from Clyde, And from the banks of Shannon. They sang of love, and not of fame; Forgot was Britain's glory: Each heart recalled a different name, But all sang “Annie Laurie.” Voice after voice caught up the song, Until its tender passion Rose like an anthem, rich and strong,— Their battle-eve confession. Dear girl, her name he dared not speak, But, as the song grew louder, Something upon the soldier's cheek Washed off the stains of powder. Beyond the darkening ocean burned The bloody sunset's embers, While the Crimean valleys learned How English love remembers. And once again a fire of hell Rained on the Russian quarters, With scream of shot, and burst of shell, And bellowing of the mortars! And Irish Nora's eyes are dim For a singer, dumb and gory; And English Mary mourns for him Who sang of “Annie Laurie.” Sleep, soldiers! still in honored rest Your truth and valor wearing: The bravest are the tenderest,— The loving are the daring. 1856. ICARUS I Io triumphe! Lo, thy certain art, My crafty sire, releases us at length! False Minos now may knit his baffled brows, And in the labyrinth by thee devised His brutish horns in angry search may toss The Minotaur,—but thou and I are free! See where it lies, one dark spot on the breast Of plains far-shining in the long-lost day, Thy glory and our prison! Either hand Crete, with her hoary mountains, olive-clad In twinkling silver, 'twixt the vineyard rows, Divides the glimmering seas. On Ida's top The sun, discovering first an earthly throne, Sits down in splendor; lucent vapors rise From folded glens among the awaking hills, Expand their hovering films, and touch, and spread In airy planes beneath us, hearths of air Whereon the Morning burns her hundred fires. II Take thou thy way between the cloud and wave. O Dædalus, my father, steering forth To friendly Samos, or the Carian shore! But me the spaces of the upper heaven Attract, the height, the freedom, and the joy. For now, from that dark treachery escaped, And tasting power which was the lust of youth, Whene'er the white blades of the sea-gull's wings Flashed round the headland, or the barbèd files Of cranes returning clanged across the sky, No half-way flight, no errand incomplete I purpose. Not, as once in dreams, with pain I mount, with fear and huge exertion hold Myself a moment, ere the sickening fall Breaks in the shock of waking. Launched, at last, Uplift on powerful wings, I veer and float Past sunlit isles of cloud, that dot with light The boundless archipelago of sky. I fan the airy silence till it starts In rustling whispers, swallowed up as soon; I warm the chilly ether with my breath; I with the beating of my heart make glad The desert blue. Have I not raised myself Unto this height, and shall I cease to soar? The curious eagles wheel about my path: With sharp and questioning eyes they stare at me, With harsh, impatient screams they menace me, Who, with these vans of cunning workmanship Broad-spread, adventure on their high domain,— Now mine, as well. Henceforth, ye clamorous birds, I claim the azure empire of the air! Henceforth I breast the current of the morn, Between her crimson shores: a star, henceforth, Upon the crawling dwellers of the earth My forehead shines. The steam of sacred blood, The smoke of burning flesh on altars laid, Fumes of the temple-wine, and sprinkled myrrh, Shall reach my palate ere they reach the Gods. III Nay, am not I a God? What other wing, If not a God's, could in the rounded sky Hang thus in solitary poise? What need, Ye proud Immortals, that my balanced plumes Should grow, like yonder eagle's from the nest? It may be, ere my crafty father's line Sprang from Erectheus, some artificer, Who found you roaming wingless on the hills, Naked, asserting godship in the dearth Of loftier claimants, fashioned you the same. Thence did you seize Olympus: thence your pride Compelled the race of men, your slaves, to tear The temple from the mountain's marble womb, To carve you shapes more beautiful than they, To sate your idle nostrils with the reek Of gums and spices, heaped on jewelled gold. IV Lo, where Hyperion, through the glowing air Approaching, drives! Fresh from his banquet-meats, Flushed with Olympian nectar, angrily He guides his fourfold span of furious steeds, Convoyed by that bold Hour whose ardent torch Burns up the dew, toward the narrow beach, This long, projecting spit of cloudy gold Whereon I wait to greet him when he comes. Think not I fear thine anger: this day, thou, Lord of the silver bow, shalt bring a guest To sit in presence of the equal Gods In your high hall: wheel but thy chariot near, That I may mount beside thee! —What is this? I hear the crackling hiss of singèd plumes! The stench of burning feathers stifles me! My loins are stung with drops of molten wax!— Ai! ai! my ruined vans!—I fall! I die! Ere the blue noon o'erspanned the bluer strait Which parts Icaria from Samos, fell, Amid the silent wonder of the air, Fell with a shock that startled the still wave, A shrivelled wreck of crisp, entangled plumes, A head whence eagles' beaks had plucked the eyes, And clots of wax, black limbs by eagles torn In falling: and a circling eagle screamed Around that floating horror of the sea Derision, and above Hyperion shone. 1860. THE BATH Off, fetters of the falser life,— Weeds, that conceal the statue's form! This silent world with truth is rife, This wooing air is warm. Now fall the thin disguises, planned For men too weak to walk unblamed: Naked beside the sea I stand,— Naked and not ashamed. Where yonder dancing billows dip, Far-off, to ocean's misty verge, Ploughs Morning, like a full-sailed ship, The Orient's cloudy surge. With spray of scarlet fire before The ruffled gold that round her dies, She sails above the sleeping shore, Across the waking skies. The dewy beach beneath her glows; A pencilled beam, the lighthouse burns: Full-breathed, the fragrant sea-wind blows,— Life to the world returns! I stand, a spirit newly-born, White-limbed and pure, and strong, and fair; The first-begotten son of Morn, The nursling of the air! There, in a heap, the masks of Earth, The cares, the sins, the griefs, are thrown: Complete, as through diviner birth, I walk the sands alone. With downy hands the winds caress, With frothy lips the amorous sea, As welcoming the nakedness Of vanished gods, in me. Along the ridged and sloping sand, Where headlands clasp the crescent cove, A shining spirit of the land, A snowy shape, I move: Or, plunged in hollow-rolling brine, In emerald cradles rocked and swung, The sceptre of the sea is mine, And mine his endless song. For Earth with primal dew is wet, Her long-lost child to rebaptize; Her fresh, immortal Edens yet Their Adam recognize. Her ancient freedom is his fee; Her ancient beauty is his dower: She bares her ample breasts, that he May suck the milk of power. Press on, ye hounds of life, that lurk So close, to seize your harried prey; Ye fiends of Custom, Gold, and Work,— I hear your distant bay! And, like the Arab, when he bears To the insulted camel's path His garment, which the camel tears, And straight forgets his wrath; So, yonder badges of your sway, Life's paltry husks, to you I give: Fall on, and in your blindness say: We hold the fugitive! But leave to me this brief escape To simple manhood, pure and free,— A child of God, in God's own shape, Between the land and sea! 1860. THE FOUNTAIN OF TREVI The Coliseum lifts at night Its broken cells more proudly far Than in the noonday's naked light, For every rent enshrines a star: On Cæsar's hill the royal Lar Presides within his mansion old: Decay and Death no longer mar The moon's atoning mist of gold. Still lingering near the shrines renewed, We sadly, fondly, look our last; Each trace concealed of spoilage rude From old or late iconoclast, Till, Trajan's whispering forum passed, We hear the waters, showering bright, Of Trevi's ancient fountain, cast Their woven music on the night. The Genius of the Tiber nods Benign, above his tilted urn; Kneel down and drink! the beckoning gods This last libation will not spurn. Drink, and the old enchantment learn That hovers yet o'er Trevi's foam,— The promise of a sure return, Fresh footsteps in the dust of Rome! Kneel down and drink! the golden days Here lived and dreamed, shall dawn again: Albano's hill, through purple haze, Again shall crown the Latin plain. Whatever stains of Time remain, Left by the years that intervene, Lo! Trevi's fount shall toss its rain To wash the pilgrim's forehead clean. Drink, and depart! for Life is just: She gives to Faith a master-key To ope the gate of dreams august, And take from joys in memory The certainty of joys to be: And Trevi's basins shall be bare Ere we again shall fail to see Their silver in the Roman air. 1860. PROPOSAL The violet loves a sunny bank, The cowslip loves the lea; The scarlet creeper loves the elm, But I love—thee. The sunshine kisses mount and vale, The stars, they kiss the sea; The west winds kiss the clover bloom, But I kiss—thee! The oriole weds his mottled mate; The lily 's bride o' the bee; Heaven's marriage-ring is round the earth— Shall I wed thee? 1859. THE PALM AND THE PINE When Peter led the First Crusade, A Norseman wooed an Arab maid. He loved her lithe and palmy grace, And the dark beauty of her face: She loved his cheeks, so ruddy fair, His sunny eyes and yellow hair. He called: she left her father's tent; She followed wheresoe'er he went. She left the palms of Palestine To sit beneath the Norland pine. She sang the musky Orient strains Where Winter swept the snowy plains. Their natures met like Night and Morn What time the morning-star is born. The child that from their meeting grew Hung, like that star, between the two. The glossy night his mother shed From her long hair was on his head: But in its shade they saw arise The morning of his father's eyes. Beneath the Orient's tawny stain Wandered the Norseman's crimson vein: Beneath the Northern force was seen The Arab sense, alert and keen. His were the Viking's sinewy hands, The arching foot of Eastern lands. And in his soul conflicting strove Northern indifference, Southern love; The chastity of temperate blood, Impetuous passion's fiery flood; The settled faith that nothing shakes, The jealousy a breath awakes; The planning Reason's sober gaze, And fancy's meteoric blaze. And stronger, as he grew to man, The contradicting natures ran,— As mingled streams from Etna flow, One born of fire, and one of snow. And one impelled, and one withheld, And one obeyed, and one rebelled. One gave him force, the other fire; This self-control, and that desire. One filled his heart with fierce unrest; With peace serene the other blessed. He knew the depth and knew the height, The bounds of darkness and of light; And who these far extremes has seen Must needs know all that lies between. So, with untaught, instinctive art, He read the myriad-natured heart. He met the men of many a land; They gave their souls into his hand; And none of them was long unknown The hardest lesson was his own. But how he lived, and where, and when It matters not to other men; For, as a fountain disappears, To gush again in later years, So hidden blood may find the day, When centuries have rolled away; And fresher lives betray at last The lineage of a far-off Past. That nature, mixed of sun and snow Repeats its ancient ebb and flow: The children of the Palm and Pine Renew their blended lives—in mine. 1855. THE VINEYARD-SAINT She, pacing down the vineyard walks, Put back the branches, one by one, Stripped the dry foliage from the stalks, And gave their bunches to the sun. On fairer hillsides, looking south, The vines were brown with cankerous rust, The earth was hot with summer drouth, And all the grapes were dim with dust. Yet here some blessed influence rained From kinder skies, the season through; On every bunch the bloom remained, And every leaf was washed in dew. I saw her blue eyes, clear and calm; I saw the aureole of her hair; I heard her chant some unknown psalm, In triumph half, and half in prayer. “Hail, maiden of the vines!” I cried: “Hail, Oread of the purple hill! For vineyard fauns too fair a bride, For me thy cup of welcome fill! “Unlatch the wicket; let me in, And, sharing, make thy toil more dear: No riper vintage holds the bin Than that our feet shall trample here. “Beneath thy beauty's light I glow, As in the sun those grapes of thine: Touch thou my heart with love, and lo! The foaming must is turned to wine!” She, pausing, stayed her careful task, And, lifting eyes of steady ray, Blew, as a wind the mountain's mask Of mist, my cloudy words away. No troubled flush o'erran her cheek; But when her quiet lips did stir, My heart knelt down to hear her speak, And mine the blush I sought in her. “Oh, not for me,” she said, “the vow So lightly breathed, to break erelong; The vintage-garland on the brow; The revels of the dancing throng! “To maiden love I shut my heart, Yet none the less a stainless bride; I work alone, I dwell apart, Because my work is sanctified. “A virgin hand must tend the vine, By virgin feet the vat be trod, Whose consecrated gush of wine Becomes the blessed blood of God! “No sinful purple here shall stain, Nor juice profane these grapes afford; But reverent lips their sweetness drain Around the Table of the Lord. “The cup I fill, of chaster gold, Upon the lighted altar stands; There, when the gates of heaven unfold, The priest exalts it in his hands. “The censer yields adoring breath, The awful anthem sinks and dies, While God, who suffered life and death, Renews His ancient sacrifice. “O sacred garden of the vine! And blessed she, ordained to press God's chosen vintage, for the wine Of pardon and of holiness!” 1860. ON LEAVING CALIFORNIA O fair young land, the youngest, fairest far Of which our world can boast,— Whose guardian planet, Evening's silver star Illumes thy golden coast,— How art thou conquered, tamed in all the pride Of savage beauty still! How brought, O panther of the splendid hide, To know thy master's will! No more thou sittest on thy tawny hills In indolent repose; Or pour'st the crystal of a thousand rills Down from thy house of snows. But where the wild-oats wrapped thy knees in gold, The ploughman drives his share, And where, through cañons deep, thy streams are rolled, The miner's arm is bare. Yet in thy lap, thus rudely rent and torn A nobler seed shall be; Mother of mighty men, thou shalt not mourn Thy lost virginity! Thy human children shall restore the grace Gone with thy fallen pines: The wild, barbaric beauty of thy face Shall round to classic lines. And Order, Justice, Social Law shall curb Thy untamed energies; And Art and Science, with their dreams superb, Replace thine ancient ease. The marble, sleeping in thy mountains now, Shall live in sculptures rare; Thy native oak shall crown the sage's brow,— Thy bay, the poet's hair. Thy tawny hills shall bleed their purple wine, Thy valleys yield their oil; And Music, with her eloquence divine, Persuade thy sons to toil. Till Hesper, as he trims his silver beam, No happier land shall see, And Earth shall find her old Arcadian dream Restored again in thee! 1859. WIND AND SEA I The sea is a jovial comrade, He laughs wherever he goes; His merriment shines in the dimpling lines That wrinkle his hale repose; He lays himself down at the feet of the Sun, And shakes all over with glee, And the broad-backed billows fall faint on the shore, In the mirth of the mighty Sea! II But the Wind is sad and restless, And cursed with an inward pain; You may hark as you will, by valley or hill, But you hear him still complain. He wails on the barren mountains, And shrieks on the wintry sea; He sobs in the cedar, and moans in the pine, And shudders all over the aspen tree. III Welcome are both their voices, And I know not which is best,— The laughter that slips from the Ocean's lips, Or the comfortless Wind's unrest. There 's a pang in all rejoicing, A joy in the heart of pain, And the Wind that saddens, the Sea that gladdens, Are singing the selfsame strain. 1855. MY DEAD Give back the soul of youth once more! The years are fleeting fast away, And this brown hair will soon be gray, These cheeks be pale and furrowed o'er. Ah, no, the child is long since dead, Whose light feet spurred the laggard years, Who breathed in future atmospheres, Ere Youth's eternal Present fled. Dead lies the boy, whose timid eye Shunned every face that spake not love; Whose simple vision looked above, And saw a glory in the sky. And now the youth has sighed his last; I see him cold upon his bier, But in these eyes there is no tear: He joins his brethren of the Past. 'Twas time he died: the gates of Art Had shut him from the temple's shrine, And now I climb her mount divine, But with the sinews, not the heart. How many more, O Life! shall I In future offer up to thee? And shall they perish utterly, Upon whose graves I clomb so high? Say, shall I not at last attain Some height, from whence the Past is clear, In whose immortal atmosphere I shall behold my Dead again? 1855. THE LOST CROWN You ask me why I sometimes drop The threads of talk I weave with you, And midway in expression stop As if a sudden trumpet blew. It is because a trumpet blows From steeps your feet will never climb: It calls my soul from present woes To rule some buried realm of Time. Wide open swing the guarded gates, That shut from you the vales of dawn; And there my car of triumph waits, By white, immortal horses drawn. A throne of gold the wheels uphold, Each spoke a ray of jewelled fire: The crimson banners float unrolled, Or falter when the winds expire. Lo! where the valley's bed expands, Through cloudy censer-smoke, upcurled— The avenue to distant lands— The single landscape of a world! I mount the throne; I seize the rein; Between the shouting throngs I go, The millions crowding hill and plain. And now a thousand trumpets blow! The armies of the world are there, The pomp, the beauty, and the power, Far-shining through the dazzled air, To crown the triumph of the hour. Enthroned aloft, I seem to float On wide, victorious wings upborne, Past the rich vale's expanding throat, To where the palace burns with morn. My limbs dilate, my breast expands, A starry fire is in my eye; I ride above the subject lands, A god beneath the hollow sky. Peal out, ye clarions! shout, ye throngs, Beneath your banners' reeling folds! This pageantry to me belongs,— My hand its proper sceptre holds. Surge on, in still augmenting lines, Till the great plain be overrun, And my procession far outshines The bended pathway of the sun! But when my triumph overtops This language, which from vassals grew, The crown from off my forehead drops, And I again am serf with you. 1855. STUDIES FOR PICTURES I AT HOME The rain is sobbing on the world; The house is dark, the hearth is cold; And, stretching drear and ashy gray Beyond the cedars, lies the bay. The winds are moaning, as they pass Through tangled knots of autumn grass,— A weary, dreary sound of woe, As if all joy were dead below. I sit alone, I wait in vain Some voice to lull this nameless pain; But from my neighbor's cottage near Come sounds of happy household cheer. My neighbor at his window stands, His youngest baby in his hands; The others seek his tender kiss, And one sweet woman crowns his bliss. I look upon the rainy wild: I have no wife, I have no child: There is no fire upon my hearth, And none to love me on the earth. II THE NEIGHBOR How cool and wet the lowlands lie Beneath the cloaked and wooded sky! How softly beats the welcome rain Against the plashy window-pane! There is no sail upon the bay: We cannot go abroad to-day, But, darlings, come and take my hand, And hear a tale of Fairy-land. The baby's little head shall rest In quiet on his father's breast, And mother, if he chance to stir, Shall sing him songs once sung to her. Ah, little ones, ye do not fret Because the garden grass is wet; Ye love the rains, whene'er they come, That all day keep your father home. No fish to-day the net shall yield; The happy oxen graze afield; The thirsty corn will drink its fill, And louder sing the woodland rill. Then, darlings, nestle round the hearth; Ye are the sunshine of the earth: Your tender eyes so fondly shine, They bring a welcome rain to mine. III UNDER THE STARS How the hot revel's fever dies, Beneath the stillness of the skies! How suddenly the whirl and glare Shoot far away, and this cold air Its icy beverage brings, to chase The burning wine-flush from my face! The window's gleam still faintly falls, And music sounds at intervals, Jarring the pulses of the night With whispers of profane delight; But on the midnight's awful strand, Like some wrecked swimmer flung to land, I lie, and hear those breakers roar: And smile—they cannot harm me more! Keep, keep your lamps; they do not mar The silver of a single star. The painted roses you display Drop from your cheeks, and fade away; The snowy warmth you bid me see Is hollowness and mockery; The words that make your sin so fair Grow silent in this vestal air; The loosened madness of your hair, That wrapped me in its snaky coils, No more shall mesh me in your toils; Your very kisses on my brow Burn like the lips of devils now. O sacred night! O virgin calm! Teach me the immemorial psalm Of your eternal watch sublime Above the grovelling lusts of Time! Within, the orgie shouts and reels; Without, the planets' golden wheels Spin, circling through the utmost space; Within, each flushed and reckless face Is masked to cheat a haunting care; Without, the silence and the prayer. Within, the beast of flesh controls; Without, the God that speaks in souls! IV IN THE MORNING The lamps were thick; the air was hot; The heavy curtains hushed the room; The sultry midnight seemed to blot All life but ours in vacant gloom. You spoke: my blood in every vein Throbbed, as by sudden fever stirred, And some strange whirling in my brain Subdued my judgement, as I heard. Ah, yes! when men are dead asleep, When all the tongues of day are still, The heart must sometimes fail to keep Its natural poise 'twixt good and ill. You knew too well its blind desires, Its savage instincts, scarce confessed; I could not see you touch the wires, But felt your lightning in my breast. For you, Life's web displayed its flaws, The wrong which Time transforms to right: The iron mesh of social laws Was but a cobweb in your sight. You showed that tempting freedom, where The passions bear their perfect fruit, The cheats of conscience cannot scare, And Self is monarch absolute. And something in me seemed to rise, And trample old obedience down: The serf sprang up, with furious eyes, And clutched at the imperial crown. That fierce rebellion overbore The arbiter that watched within, Till Sin so changed an aspect wore, It was no longer that of Sin. You gloried in the fevered flush That spread, defiant, o'er my face, Nor thought how soon this morning's blush Would chronicle the night's disgrace. I wash my eyes; I bathe my brow; I see the sun on hill and plain: The old allegiance claims me now, The old content returns again. Ah, seek to stop the sober glow And healthy airs that come with day, For when the cocks at dawning crow Your evil spirits flee away. 1855. SUNKEN TREASURES When the uneasy waves of life subside, And the soothed ocean sleeps in glassy rest, I see, submerged beyond or storm or tide, The treasures gathered in its greedy breast. There still they shine, through the translucent Past, Far down on that forever quiet floor; No fierce upheaval of the deep shall cast Them back,—no wave shall wash them to the shore. I see them gleaming, beautiful as when Erewhile they floated, convoys of my fate; The barks of lovely women, noble men, Full-sailed with hope, and stored with Love's own freight. The sunken ventures of my heart as well, Look up to me, as perfect as at dawn; My golden palace heaves beneath the swell To meet my touch, and is again withdrawn. There sleep the early triumphs, cheaply won, That led Ambition to his utmost verge, And still his visions, like a drowning sun, Send up receding splendors through the surge. There wait the recognitions, the quick ties, Whence the heart knows its kin, wherever cast; And there the partings, when the wistful eyes Caress each other as they look their last. There lie the summer eves, delicious eves, The soft green valleys drenched with light divine, The lisping murmurs of the chestnut leaves, The hand that lay, the eyes that looked in mine. There lives the hour of fear and rapture yet, The perilled climax of the passionate years; There still the rains of wan December wet A naked mound,—I cannot see for tears! There are they all: they do not fade or waste, Lapped in the arms of the embalming brine; More fair than when their being mine embraced,— Of nobler aspect, beauty more divine. I see them all, but stretch my hands in vain; No deep-sea plummet reaches where they rest; No cunning diver shall descend the main, And bring a single jewel from its breast. 1855. THE VOYAGERS No longer spread the sail! No longer strain the oar! For never yet has blown the gale Will bring us nearer shore. The swaying keel slides on, The helm obeys the hand; Fast we have sailed from dawn to dawn, Yet never reach the land. Each morn we see its peaks, Made beautiful with snow; Each eve its vales and winding creeks, That sleep in mist below. At noon we mark the gleam Of temples tall and fair; At midnight watch its bonfires stream In the auroral air. And still the keel is swift, And still the wind is free, And still as far its mountains lift Beyond the enchanted sea. Yet vain is all return, Though false the goal before; The gale is ever dead astern, The current sets to shore. O shipmates, leave the ropes,— And what though no one steers, We sail no faster for our hopes, No slower for our fears. Howe'er the bark is blown, Lie down and sleep awhile: What profits toil, when chance alone Can bring us to the isle? 1855. SONG Now the days are brief and drear: Naked lies the new-born Year In his cradle of the snow, And the winds unbridled blow, And the skies hang dark and low,— For the Summers come and go. Leave the clashing cymbals mute! Pipe no more the happy flute! Sing no more that dancing rhyme Of the rose's harvest-time;— Sing a requiem, sad and low: For the Summers come and go. Where is Youth? He strayed away Through the meadow-flowers of May. Where is Love? The leaves that fell From his trysting-bower, can tell. Wisdom stays, sedate and slow, And the Summers come and go. Yet a few more years to run, Wheeling round in gloom and sun: Other raptures, other woes,— Toil alternate with Repose: Then to sleep where daisies grow, While the Summers come and go. 1858. THE MYSTERY Thou art not dead; thou art not gone to dust; No line of all thy loveliness shall fall To formless ruin, smote by Time, and thrust Into the solemn gulf that covers all. Thou canst not wholly perish, though the sod Sink with its violets closer to thy breast; Though by the feet of generations trod, The headstone crumbles from thy place of rest. The marvel of thy beauty cannot die: The sweetness of thy presence shall not fade; Earth gave not all the glory of thine eye,— Death may not keep what Death has never made. It was not thine, that forehead strange and cold, Nor those dumb lips, they hid beneath the snow; Thy heart would throb beneath that passive fold, Thy hands for me that stony clasp forego. But thou hadst gone,—gone from the dreary land, Gone from the storms let loose on every hill, Lured by the sweet persuasion of a hand Which leads thee somewhere in the distance still. Where'er thou art, I know thou wearest yet The same bewildering beauty, sanctified By calmer joy, and touched with soft regret For him who seeks, but cannot reach thy side. I keep for thee the living love of old, And seek thy place in Nature, as a child Whose hand is parted from his playmate's hold, Wanders and cries along a lonesome wild. When, in the watches of my heart, I hear The messages of purer life, and know The footsteps of thy spirit lingering near, The darkness hides the way that I should go. Canst thou not bid the empty realms restore That form, the symbol of thy heavenly part? Or on the fields of barren silence pour That voice, the perfect music of thy heart? Oh once, once bending to these widowed lips, Take back the tender warmth of life from me, Or let thy kisses cloud with swift eclipse The light of mine, and give me death with thee? 1851. A PICTURE Sometimes, in sleeping dreams of night, Or waking dreams of day, The selfsame picture seeks my sight And will not fade away. I see a valley, cold and still, Beneath a leaden sky: The woods are leafless on the hill, The fields deserted lie. The gray November eve benumbs The damp and cheerless air; A wailing from the forest comes, As of the world's despair. But on the verge of night and storm, Far down the valley's line, I see the lustre, red and warm, Of cottage windows shine. And men are housed, and in their place In snug and happy rest, Save one, who walks with weary pace The highway's frozen breast. His limbs, that tremble with the cold, Shrink from the coming storm; But underneath his mantle's fold His heart beats quick and warm. He hears the laugh of those who sit In Home's contented air: He sees the busy shadows flit Across the window's glare. His heart is full of love unspent, His eyes are wet and dim; For in those circles of content There is no room for him. He clasps his hands and looks above, He makes the bitter cry: “All, all are happy in their love,— All are beloved but I!” Across no threshold streams the light, Expectant, o'er his track; No door is opened on the night, To bid him welcome back. There is no other man abroad In all the wintry vale, And lower upon his lonely road The darkness and the gale. I see him through the doleful shades Press onward, sad and slow, Till from my dream the picture fades, And from my heart the woe. 1854. IN THE MEADOWS I lie in the summer meadows, In the meadows all alone, With the infinite sky above me, And the sun on his midday throne. The smell of the flowering grasses Is sweeter than any rose, And a million happy insects Sing in the warm repose. The mother lark that is brooding Feels the sun on her wings, And the deeps of the noonday glitter With swarms of fairy things. From the billowy green beneath me To the fathomless blue above, The creatures of God are happy In the warmth of their summer love. The infinite bliss of Nature I feel in every vein; The light and the life of Summer Blossom in heart and brain. But darker than any shadow By thunder-clouds unfurled, The awful truth arises, That Death is in the world! And the sky may beam as ever, And never a cloud be curled; And the airs be living odors, But Death is in the world! Out of the deeps of sunshine The invisible bolt is hurled: There 's life in the summer meadows, But Death is in the world! 1854. “DOWN IN THE DELL I WANDERED” Down in the dell I wandered, The loneliest of our dells, Where grow the lowland lilies, Dropping their foam-white bells, And the brook among the grasses Toys with its sand and shells. Fair were the meads and thickets, And sumptuous grew the trees, And the folding hills of harvest Were thrilled with the rippling breeze, But I heard beyond the valley, The hum of the plunging seas. The birds and the vernal grasses, They wooed me sweetly and long, But the magic of ocean called me, Murmuring free and strong. And the voice of the peaceful valley Mixed with the billow's song! “Stay in the wood's embraces! Stay in the dell's repose!” “Float on the limitless azure, Flecked with its foamy snows!” These were the flattering voices, Mingled in musical close. Bliss in the soft, green shelter, Fame on the boundless blue, Free with the winds of the ages, Nestled in shade and dew: Which shall I yield forever? Which shall I clasp and woo? SONG They call thee false as thou art fair, They call thee fair and free,— A creature pliant as the air And changeful as the sea: But I, who gaze with other eyes,— Who stand and watch afar,— Behold thee pure as yonder skies And steadfast as a star! Thine is a rarer nature, born To rule the common crowd, And thou dost lightly laugh to scorn The hearts before thee bowed. Thou dreamest of a different love Than comes to such as these; That soars as high as heaven above Their shallow sympathies. A star that shines with flickering spark Thou dost not wane away, But shed'st adown the purple dark The fulness of thy ray: A rose, whose odors freely part At every zephyr's will, Thou keep'st within thy folded heart Its virgin sweetness still! THE PHANTOM Again I sit within the mansion, In the old, familiar seat; And shade and sunshine chase each other O'er the carpet at my feet. But the sweet-brier's arms have wrestled upwards In the summers that are past, And the willow trails its branches lower Than when I saw them last. They strive to shut the sunshine wholly From out the haunted room; To fill the house, that once was joyful, With silence and with gloom. And many kind, remembered faces Within the doorway come.— Voices, that wake the sweeter music Of one that now is dumb. They sing, in tones as glad as ever, The songs she loved to hear; They braid the rose in summer garlands, Whose flowers to her were dear. And still, her footsteps in the passage, Her blushes at the door, Her timid words of maiden welcome, Come back to me once more. And, all forgetful of my sorrow, Unmindful of my pain, I think she has but newly left me, And soon will come again. She stays without, perchance, a moment To dress her dark-brown hair; I hear the rustle of her garments— Her light step on the stair! O fluttering heart! control thy tumult, Lest eyes profane should see My cheeks betray the rush of rapture Her coming brings to me! She tarries long: but lo! a whisper Beyond the open door, And, gliding through the quiet sunshine, A shadow on the floor! Ah! 't is the whispering pine that calls me, The vine, whose shadow strays; And my patient heart must still await her, Nor chide her long delays. But my heart grows sick with weary waiting, As many a time before: Her foot is ever at the threshold, Yet never passes o'er. 1854. THE POET'S JOURNAL PREFACE THE RETURN OF THE GODDESS Not as in youth, with steps outspeeding morn, And cheeks all bright, from rapture of the way, But in strange mood, half cheerful, half forlorn, She comes to me to-day. Does she forget the trysts we used to keep, When dead leaves rustled on autumnal ground, Or the lone garret, whence she banished sleep With threats of silver sound? Does she forget how shone the happy eyes When they beheld her,—how the eager tongue Plied its swift oar through wave-like harmonies, To reach her where she sung? How at her sacred feet I cast me down? How she upraised me to her bosom fair, And from her garland shred the first light crown That ever pressed my hair? Though dust is on the leaves, her breath will bring Their freshness back: why lingers she so long? The pulseless air is waiting for her wing, Dumb with unuttered song. If tender doubt delay her on the road, Oh let her haste to find the doubt belied! If shame for love unworthily bestowed, That shame shall melt in pride. If she but smile, the crystal calm shall break In music, sweeter than it ever gave, As when a breeze breathes o'er some sleeping lake And laughs in every wave. The ripples of awakened song shall die Kissing her feet, and woo her not in vain, Until, as once, upon her breast I lie— Pardoned, and loved again! 1859. INSCRIPTION TO THE MISTRESS OF CEDARCROFT I The evening shadows lengthen on the lawn: Westward, our immemorial chestnuts stand, A mount of shade; but o'er the cedars drawn, Between the hedge-row trees, in many a band Of brightening gold, the sunshine lingers on, And soon will touch our oaks with parting hand: And down the distant valley all is still, And flushed with purple smiles the beckoning hill. II Come, leave the flowery terrace, leave the beds Where Southern children wake to Northern air: Let yon mimosas droop their tufted heads, These myrtle-trees their nuptial beauty wear, And while the dying day reluctant treads From tree-top unto tree-top, with me share The scene's idyllic peace, the evening's close, The balm of twilight, and the land's repose. III Come, for my task is done: the task that drew My footsteps from the chambers of the Day,— That held me back, Beloved, even from you, That are my daylight: for the Poet's way Turns into many a lonely avenue Where none may follow. He must sing his lay First to himself, then to the One most dear; Last, to the world. Come to my side, and hear! IV The poems ripened in a heart at rest, A life that first through you is free and strong, Take them and warm them in your partial breast, Before they try the common air of song! Fame won at home is of all fame the best: Crown me your poet, and the critic's wrong Shall harmless strike where you in love have smiled, Wife of my heart, and mother of my child! 1860. [FIRST EVENING] FIRST EVENING The day had come, the day of many years. My bud of hope, thorned round with guarding fears, And sealed with frosts of oft-renewed delay, Burst into sudden bloom—it was the day! “Ernest will come!” the early sunbeams cried; “Will come!” was breathed through all the woodlands wide; “Will come, will come!” said cloud, and brook, and bird; And when the hollow roll of wheels was heard Across the bridge, it thundered, “He is near!” And then my heart made answer, “He is here!” Ernest was here, and now the day had gone Like other days, yet wild and swift and sweet,— And yet prolonged, as if with whirling feet One troop of duplicated Hours sped on And one trod out the moments lingeringly: So distant seemed the lonely dawn from me. But all was well. He paced the new-mown lawn, With Edith at his side, and, while my firs Stood bronzed with sunset, happy glances cast On the familiar landmarks of the Past. I heard a gentle laugh: the laugh was hers. “Confess it,” she exclaimed, “I recognize, No less than you, the features of the place, So often have I seen it with the eyes Your memory gave me: yea, your very face, With every movement of the theme, betrayed That here the sunshine lay, and there the shade.” “A proof!” cried Ernest. “Let me be your guide,” She said, “and speak not: Philip shall decide.” To them I went, at beckon of her hand. A moment she the mellow landscape scanned In seeming doubt, but only to prolong A witching aspect of uncertainty, And the soft smile in Ernest's watching eye: “Yonder,” she said, “(I see I am not wrong, By Philip's face,) you built your hermit seat Against the rock, among the scented fern, Where summer lizards played about your feet; And here, beside us, is the tottering urn You cracked in fixing firmly on its base; And here—yes, yes!—this is the very place— I know the wild vine and the sassafras— Where you and Philip, lying in the grass, Disowned the world, renounced the race of men, And you all love, except your own for him, Until, through that, all love came back again.” Here Edith paused; but Ernest's eyes were dim. He kissed her, gave a loving hand to me, And spoke: “Ah, Philip, Philip, those were days We dare remember now, when only blaze Far-off, the storm's black edges brokenly. Who thinks, at night, that morn will ever be? Who knows, far out upon the central sea, That anywhere is land? And yet, a shore Has set behind us, and will rise before: A past foretells a future.” “Blessed be That Past!” I answered, “on whose bosom lay Peace, like a new-born child: and now, I see, The child is man, begetting day by day Some fresher joy, some other bliss, to make Your life the fairer for his mother's sake.” Deeper beneath the oaks the shadows grew: The twilight glimmer from their tops withdrew, And purple gloomed the distant hills, and sweet The sudden breath of evening rose, with balm Of grassy meadows: in the upper calm The pulses of the stars began to beat: The fire-flies twinkled: through the lindens went A rustle, as of happy leaves composed To airy sleep, of drowsy petals closed, And the dark land lay silent and content. We, too, were silent. Ernest walked, I knew, With me, beneath the stars of other eves: He heard, with me, the tongues of perished leaves: Departed suns their trails of splendor drew Across departed summers: whispers came From voices, long ago resolved again Into the primal Silence, and we twain, Ghosts of our present selves, yet still the same, As in a spectral mirror wandered there. Its pain outlived, the Past was only fair. Ten years had passed since I had touched his hand, And felt upon my lips the brother-kiss That shames not manhood,—years of quiet bliss To me, fast-rooted on paternal land, Mated, yet childless. He had journeyed far Beyond the borders of my life, and whirled Unresting round the vortex of the world, The reckless child of some eccentric star, Careless of fate, yet with a central strength I knew would hold his life in equipoise, And bent his wandering energies, at length, To the smooth orbit of serener joys. Few were the winds that wafted to my nest A leaf from him: I learned that he was blest,— The late fulfilment of my prophecy,— And then I felt that he must come to me, The old, unswerving sympathy to claim; And set my house in order for a guest Long ere the message of his coming came. In gentle terraces my garden fell Down to the rolling lawn. On one side rose, Flanking the layers of bloom, a bolder swell With laurels clad, and every shrub that grows Upon our native hills, a bosky mound, Whence the commingling valleys might be seen Bluer and lovelier through the gaps of green. The rustic arbor which the summit crowned Was woven of shining smilax, trumpet-vine, Clematis, and the wild white eglantine, Whose tropical luxuriance overhung The interspaces of the posts, and made For each sweet picture frames of bloom and shade. It was my favorite haunt when I was young, To read my poets, watch my sunset fade Behind my father's hills, and, when the moon Shed warmer silver through the nights of June, Dream, as 't were new, the universal dream. This arbor, too, was Ernest's hermitage: Here he had read to me his tear-stained page Of sorrow, here renewed the pang supreme Which burned his youth to ashes: here would try To lay his burden in the hands of Song, And make the Poet bear the Lover's wrong, But still his heart impatiently would cry: “In vain, in vain! You cannot teach to flow In measured lines so measureless a woe. First learn to slay this wild beast of despair, Then from his harmless jaws your honey tear!” Hither we came. Beloved hands had graced The table with a flask of mellow juice, Thereto the gentle herb that poets use When Fancy droops, and in the corner placed A lamp, that glimmered through its misty sphere Like moonlit marble, on a pedestal Of knotted roots, against the leafy wall. The air was dry, the night was calm and clear, And in the dying clover crickets chirped. The Past, I felt, the Past alone usurped Our thoughts,—the hour of confidence had come, Of sweet confession, tender interchange, Which drew our hearts together, yet with strange Half-dread repelled them. Seeing Ernest dumb With memories of the spot, as if to me Belonged the right his secrets to evoke. And Edith's eyes on mine, consentingly, Conscious of all I wished to know, I spoke: “Dear Friend, one volume of your life I read Beneath these vines: you placed it in my hand And made it mine,—but how the tale has sped Since then. I know not, or can understand From this fair ending only. Let me see The intervening chapters, dark and bright, In order, as you lived them. Give to-night Unto the Past, dear Ernest, and to me!” Thus I, with doubt and loving hesitance, Lest I should touch a nerve he fain would hide; But he, with calm and reassuring glance, In which no troubled shadow lay, replied: “That mingled light and darkness are no more In this new life, than are the sun and shade Of painted landscapes: distant lies the shore Where last we parted, Philip: how I made The journey, what adventures on the road, What haps I met, what struggles, what success Of fame, or gold, or place, concerns you less, Dear friend, than how I lost that sorest load I started with, and came to dwell at last In the House Beautiful. There but remains A fragment here and there,—wild, broken strains And scattered voices speaking from the Past.” “Let me those broken voices hear,” I said, “And I shall know the rest.” “Well—be it so. You, who would write ‘Resurgam’ o'er my dead, The resurrection of my heart shall know.” Then Edith rose, and up the terraces Went swiftly to the house; but soon we spied Her white dress gleam, returning through the trees, And, softly flushed, she came to Ernest's side, A volume in her hand. But he delayed Awhile his task, revolving leaf by leaf With tender interest, now that ancient grief No more had power to make his heart afraid; For pain, that only lives in memory, Like battle-scars, it is no pain to show. “Here, Philip, are the secrets you would know,” He said: “Howe'er obscure the utterance be The lamp you lighted in the olden time Will show my heart's-blood beating through the rhyme: A poet's journal, writ in fire and tears At first, blind protestations, blinder rage, (For you and Edith only, many a page!) Then slow deliverance, with the gaps of years Between, and final struggles into life, Which the heart shrank from, as 'twere death instead.” Then, with a loving glance towards his wife, Which she as fondly answered, thus he read:— THE TORSO I In clay the statue stood complete, As beautiful a form, and fair, As ever walked a Roman street Or breathed the blue Athenian air: The perfect limbs, divinely bare, Their old, heroic freedom kept, And in the features, fine and rare, A calm, immortal sweetness slept. II O'er common men it towered, a god, And smote their meaner life with shame, For while its feet the highway trod, Its lifted brow was crowned with flame And purified from touch of blame: Yet wholly human was the face, And over them who saw it came The knowledge of their own disgrace. III It stood, regardless of the crowd, And simply showed what men might be: Its solemn beauty disavowed The curse of lost humanity. Erect and proud, and pure and free, It overlooked each loathsome law Whereunto others bend the knee, And only what was noble saw. IV The patience and the hope of years Their final hour of triumph caught; The clay was tempered with my tears, The forces of my spirit wrought With hands of fire to shape my thought, That when, complete, the statue stood, To marble resurrection brought, The Master might pronounce it good. V But in the night an enemy, Who could not bear the wreath should grace My ready forehead, stole the key And hurled my statue from its base; And now its fragments strew the place Where I had dreamed its shrine might be: The stains of common earth deface Its beauty and its majesty. VI The torso prone before me lies; The cloven brow is knit with pain: Mute lips, and blank, reproachful eyes Unto my hands appeal in vain. My hands shall never work again: My hope is dead, my strength is spent: This fatal wreck shall now remain The ruined sculptor's monument. 1860. ON THE HEADLAND I sit on the lonely headland, Where the sea-gulls come and go: The sky is gray above me, And the sea is gray below. There is no fisherman's pinnace Homeward or outward bound; I see no living creature In the world's deserted round. I pine for something human, Man, woman, young or old,— Something to meet and welcome, Something to clasp and hold. I have a mouth for kisses, But there 's no one to give and take; I have a heart in my bosom Beating for nobody's sake. O warmth of love that is wasted! Is there none to stretch a hand? No other heart that hungers In all the living land? I could fondle the fisherman's baby, And rock it into rest; I could take the sunburnt sailor, Like a brother, to my breast. I could clasp the hand of any Outcast of land or sea, If the guilty palm but answered The tenderness in me! The sea might rise and drown me,— Cliffs fall and crush my head,— Were there one to love me, living, Or weep to see me dead! 1855. MARAH The waters of my life were sweet, Before that bolt of sorrow fell; But now, though fainting with the heat, I dare not drink the bitter well. My God! shall Sin across the heart Sweep like a wind that leaves no trace, But Grief inflict a rankling smart No after blessing can efface? I see the tired mechanic take His evening rest beside his door, And gentlier, for their father's sake, His children tread the happy floor: The kitchen teems with cheering smells, With clash of cups and clink of knives, And all the household picture tells Of humble yet contented lives. Then in my heart the serpents hiss: What right have these, who scarcely know The perfect sweetness of their bliss, To flaunt it thus before my woe? Like bread, Love's portion they divide, Like water drink his precious wine, When the least crumb they cast aside Were manna for these lips of mine. I see the friend of other days Lead home his flushed and silent bride! His eyes are suns of tender praise. Her eyes are stars of tender pride. Go, hide your shameless happiness. The demon cries, within my breast; Think not that I the bond can bless, Which seeing, I am twice unblest. The husband of a year proclaims His recent honor, shows the boy, And calls the babe a thousand names, And dandles it in awkward joy: And then—I see the wife's pale cheek, Her eyes of pure, celestial ray— The curse is choked: I cannot speak, But, weeping, turn my head away! 1860. THE VOICE OF THE TEMPTER Last night the Tempter came to me, and said: “Why sorrow any longer for the dead? The wrong is done: thy tears and groans are naught: Forget the Past,—thy pain but lives in thought. Night after night, I hear thy cries implore An answer: she will answer thee no more. Give up thine idle prayer that Death may come And thou mayest somewhere find her: Death is dumb To those that seek him. Live: for youth is thine. Let not thy rich blood, like neglected wine, Grow thin and stale, but rouse thyself, at last, And take a man's revenge upon the Past. What have thy virtues brought thee? Let them go, And with them lose the burden of thy woe, Their only payment for thy service hard: They but exact, thou see'st, and not reward. Thy life is cheated, thou art cast aside In dust, the worn-out vessel of their pride. Come, take thy pleasure: others do the same, And love is theirs, and fortune, name, and fame! Let not the name of Vice thine ear affright: Vice is no darkness, but a different light, Which thou dost need, to see thy path aright: Or if some pang in this experience lie, Through counter-pain thy present pain will die. Bethink thee of the lost, the barren years, Of harsh privations, unavailing tears, The steady ache of strong desires restrained, And what thou hast deserved, and what obtained: Then go, thou fool! and, if thou canst, rejoice To make such base ingratitude thy choice, While each indulgence which thy brethren taste But mocks thy palate, as it runs to waste!” So spake the Tempter, as he held outspread Alluring pictures round my prostrate head. 'Twixt sleep and waking, in my helpless ear His honeyed voice rang musical and clear; And half persuaded, shaken half with fear, I heard him, till the Morn began to shine, And found her brow less dewy-wet than mine. 1860. EXORCISM O tongues of the Past, be still! Are the days not over and gone? The joys have perished that were so sweet, But the sorrow still lives on. I have sealed the graves of my hopes; I have carried the pall of love: Let the pains and pangs be buried as deep, And the grass be as green above! But the ghosts of the dead arise: They come when the board is spread; They poison the wine of the banquet cups With the mould their lips have shed. The pulse of the bacchant blood May throb in the ivy wreath, But the berries are plucked from the nightshade bough That grows in the gardens of Death. I sleep with joy at my heart, Warm as a new-made bride; But a vampire comes to suck her blood, And I wake with a corpse at my side. O ghosts, I have given to you The bliss of the faded years; The sweat of my brow, the blood of my heart, And manhood's terrible tears! Take them, and be content: I have nothing more to give: My soul is chilled in the house of Death, And 'tis time that I should live. Take them, and let me be: Lie still in the churchyard mould, Nor chase from my heart each new delight With the phantom of the old! 1855. SQUANDERED LIVES The fisherman wades in the surges; The sailor sails over the sea; The soldier steps bravely to battle; The woodman lays axe to the tree. They are each of the breed of the heroes, The manhood attempered in strife: Strong hands, that go lightly to labor, True hearts, that take comfort in life. In each is the seed to replenish The world with the vigor it needs,— The centre of honest affections, The impulse to generous deeds. But the shark drinks the blood of the fisher; The sailor is dropped in the sea; The soldier lies cold by his cannon; The woodman is crushed by his tree. Each prodigal life that is wasted In manly achievement unseen, But lengthens the days of the coward, And strengthens the crafty and mean. The blood of the noblest is lavished That the selfish a profit may find; But God sees the lives that are squandered, And we to His wisdom are blind. 1855. A SYMBOL I Heavy, and hot, and gray, Day following unto day, A felon gang, their blind life drag away,— Blind, vacant, dumb, as Time, Lapsed from his wonted prime, Begot them basely in incestuous crime: So little life there seems About the woods and streams,— Only a sleep, perplexed with nightmare-dreams. The burden of a sigh Stifles the weary sky, Where smouldering clouds in ashen masses lie: The forests fain would groan, But, silenced into stone, Crouch, in the dull blue vapors round them thrown. O light, more drear than gloom! Than death more dead such bloom: Yet life—yet life—shall burst this gathering doom! II Behold! a swift and silent fire Yon dull cloud pierces, in the west, And blackening, as with growing ire, He lifts his forehead from his breast. He mutters to the ashy host That all around him sleeping lie,— Sole chieftain on the airy coast, To fight the battles of the sky. He slowly lifts his weary strength, His shadow rises on the day, And distant forests feel at length A wind from landscapes far away. III How shall the cloud unload its thunder? How shall its flashes fire the air? Hills and valleys are dumb with wonder: Lakes look up with a leaden stare. Hark! the lungs of the striding giant Bellow an angry answer back! Hurling the hair from his brows defiant, Crushing the laggards along his track. Now his step, like a battling Titan's, Scales in flame the hills of the sky: Struck by his breath, the forest whitens; Fluttering waters feel him nigh! Stroke on stroke of his thunder-hammer— Sheets of flame from his anvil hurled— Heaven's doors are burst in the clamor: He alone possesses the world! IV Drowned woods, shudder no more: Vexed lakes, smile as before: Hills that vanished, appear again: Rise for harvest, prostrate grain! Shake thy jewels, twinkling grass: Blossoms, tint the winds that pass: Sun, behold a world restored! World, again thy sun is lord! Thunder-spasms the waking be Into Life from Apathy: Life, not Death, is in the gale,— Let the coming Doom prevail!1859. Thus far he read: at first with even tone, Still chanting in the old, familiar key,— That golden note, whose grand monotony Is musical in poets' mouths alone,— But broken, as he read, became the chime. To speak, once more, in Grief's forgotten tongue, And feel the hot reflex of passion flung Back on the heart by every pulse of rhyme Wherein it lives and burns, a soul might shake More calm than his. With many a tender break Of voice, a dimness of the haughty eye, And pause of wandering memory, he read; While I, with folded arms and downcast head, In silence heard each blind, bewildered cry. Thus far had Ernest read: but, closing now The book, and lifting up a calmer brow, “Forgive me, patient God, for this!” he said: “And you forgive, dear friend, and dearest wife, If I have marred an hour of this sweet life With noises from the valley of the Dead. Long, long ago, the Hand whereat I railed In blindness gave me courage to subdue This wild revolt: I see wherein I failed: My heart was false, when most I thought it true, My sorrow selfish, when I thought it pure. For those we lose, if still their love endure Translation to that other land, where Love Breathes the immortal wisdom, ask in heaven No greater sacrifice than we had given On earth, our love's integrity to prove. If we are blest to know the other blest, Then treason lies in sorrow. Vainly said! Alone each heart must cover up its dead; Alone, through bitter toil, achieve its rest: Which I have found—but still these records keep, Lest I, condemning others, should forget My own rebellion. From these tares I reap, In evil days, a fruitful harvest yet. “But 't is enough, to-night. Nay, Philip, here A chapter closes. See! the moon is near: Your laurels glitter: come, my darling, sing The hymn I wrote on such a night as this!” Then Edith, stooping first to take his kiss, Drew from its niche of woodbine her guitar, With chords prelusive tuned a slackened string, And sang, clear-voiced, as some melodious star Were dropping silver sweetness from afar: God, to whom we look up blindly, Look Thou down upon us kindly: We have sinned, but not designedly. If our faith in Thee was shaken, Pardon Thou our hearts mistaken, Our obedience reawaken. We are sinful, Thou art holy: Thou art mighty, we are lowly: Let us reach Thee, climbing slowly. Our ingratitude confessing, On Thy mercy still transgressing, Thou dost punish us with blessing! [SECOND EVENING] SECOND EVENING It was the evening of the second day, Which swifter, sweeter than the first had fled: My heart's delicious tumult passed away And left a sober happiness instead. For Ernest's voice was ever in mine ear, His presence mingled as of old with mine, But stronger, manlier, brighter, more divine Its effluence now: within his starry sphere Of love new-risen my nature too was drawn, And warmed with rosy flushes of the dawn. All day we drove about the lovely vales, Under the hill-side farms, through summer woods, The land of mingled homes and solitudes That Ernest loved. We told the dear old tales Of childhood, music new to Edith's ear, Sang olden songs, lived old adventures o'er, And, when the hours brought need of other cheer, Spread on the ferny rocks a tempting store Of country dainties. 'T was our favorite dell, Cut by the trout-stream through a wooded ridge: Above, the highway on a mossy bridge Strode o'er it, and below, the water fell Through hornblende bowlders, where the dircus flung His pliant rods, the berried spice-wood grew, And tulip-trees and smooth magnolias hung A million leaves between us and the blue. The silver water-dust in puffs arose And turned to dust of jewels in the sun, And like a cañon, in its close begun Afresh, the stream's perpetual lullaby Sang down the dell, and deepened its repose. Here, till the western hours had left the sky, We sat: then homeward loitered through the dusk Of chestnut woods, along the meadow-side, And lost in lanes that breathed ambrosial musk Of wild-grape blossoms: and the twilight died. Long after every star came out, we paced The terrace, still discoursing on the themes The day had started, intermixed with dreams Born of the summer night. Then, golden-faced, Behind her daybreak of auroral gleams, The moon arose: the bosom of the lawn Whitened beneath her silent snow of light, Save where the trees made isles of mystic night, Dark blots against the rising splendor drawn, And where the eastern wall of woodland towered, Blue darkness, filled with undistinguished shapes: But elsewhere, over all the landscape showered— A silver drizzle on the distant capes Of hills—the glory of the moon. We sought, Drawn thither by the same unspoken thought, The mound, where now the leaves of laurel clashed Their dagger-points of light, around the bower, And through the nets of leaf and elfin flower, Cold fire, the sprinkled drops of moonshine flashed. Erelong in Ernest's hand the volume lay, (I did not need a second time to ask,) And he resumed the intermitted task. “This night, dear Philip, is the Poet's day,” He said: “the world is one confessional: Our sacred memories as freely fall As leaves from o'er-ripe blossoms: we betray Ourselves to Nature, who the tale can win We shrink from uttering in the daylight's din. So, Friend, come back with me a little way Along the years, and in these records find The sole inscriptions they have left behind.” ATONEMENT If thou hadst died at midnight, With a lamp beside thy bed; The beauty of sleep exchanging For the beauty of the dead: When the bird of heaven had called thee, And the time had come to go, And the northern lights were dancing On the dim December snow,— If thou hadst died at midnight, I had ceased to bid thee stay, Hearing the feet of the Father Leading His child away. I had knelt, in the awful Presence, And covered my guilty head, And received His absolution For my sins toward the dead. But the cruel sun was shining In the cold and windy sky, And Life, with his mocking voices, Looked in to see thee die. God came and went unheeded; No tear repentant shone; And he took the heart from my bosom, And left in its place a stone. Each trivial promise broken, Each tender word unsaid, Must be evermore unspoken,— Unpardoned by the dead. Unpardoned? No: the struggle Of years was not in vain,— The patience that wearies passion, And the prayers that conquer pain. This tardy resignation May be the blessed sign Of pardon and atonement, Thy spirit sends to mine. Now first I dare remember That day of death and woe: Within, the dreadful silence, Without, the sun and snow! 1860. DECEMBER The beech is bare, and bare the ash, The thickets white below; The fir-tree scowls with hoar moustache, He cannot sing for snow. The body-guard of veteran pines, A grim battalion, stands; They ground their arms, in ordered lines, For Winter so commands. The waves are dumb along the shore, The river's pulse is still; The north-wind's bugle blows no more Reveillé from the hill. The rustling sift of falling snow, The muffled crush of leaves, These are the sounds suppressed, that show How much the forest grieves; But, as the blind and vacant Day Crawls to his ashy bed, I hear dull echoes far away, Like drums above the dead. Sigh with me, Pine that never changed! Thou wear'st the Summer's hue; Her other loves are all estranged, But thou and I are true! 1856. SYLVAN SPIRITS The gray stems rise, the branches braid A covering of deepest shade. Beneath these old, inviolate trees There comes no stealthy, sliding breeze, To overhear their mysteries. Steeped in the fragrant breath of leaves, My heart a hermit peace receives: The sombre forest thrusts a screen My refuge and the world between, And beds me in its balmy green. No fret of life may here intrude, To vex the sylvan solitude. Pure spirits of the earth and air, From hollow trunk and bosky lair Come forth, and hear your lover's prayer! Come, Druid soul of ancient oak, Thou, too, hast felt the thunder-stroke; Come, Hamadryad of the beech, Nymph of the burning maple, teach My heart the solace of your speech! Alas! the sylvan ghosts preserve The natures of the race they serve. Not only Dryads, chaste and shy, But piping Fauns, come dancing nigh, And Satyrs of the shaggy thigh. Across the calm, the holy hush, And shadowed air, there darts a flush Of riot, from the lawless brood, And rebel voices in my blood Salute these orgies of the wood. Not sacred thoughts alone engage The saint in silent hermitage: The soul within him heavenward strives, Yet strong, as in profaner lives, The giant of the flesh survives. From Nature, as from human haunts, That giant draws his sustenance. By her own elves, in woodlands wild She sees her robes of prayer defiled: She is not purer than her child. 1860. THE LOST MAY When May, with cowslip-braided locks, Walks through the land in green attire, And burns in meadow-grass the phlox His torch of purple fire: When buds have burst the silver sheath, And shifting pink, and gray, and gold Steal o'er the woods, while fair beneath The bloomy vales unfold: When, emerald-bright, the hemlock stands New-feathered, needled new the pine; And, exiles from the orient lands, The turbaned tulips shine: When wild azaleas deck the knoll, And cinque-foil stars the fields of home, And winds, that take the white-weed, roll The meadows into foam: Then from the jubilee I turn To other Mays that I have seen, Where more resplendent blossoms burn, And statelier woods are green;— Mays, when my heart expanded first, A honeyed blossom, fresh with dew; And one sweet wind of heaven dispersed The only clouds I knew. For she, whose softly-murmured name The music of the month expressed, Walked by my side, in holy shame Of girlish love confessed. The budding chestnuts overhead, Their sprinkled shadows in the lane,— Blue flowers along the brooklet's bed,— I see them all again! The old, old tale of girl and boy, Repeated ever, never old: To each in turn the gates of joy, The gates of heaven unfold. And when the punctual May arrives, With cowslip-garland on her brow, We know what once she gave our lives And cannot give us now. 1860. CHURCHYARD ROSES The woodlands wore a gloomy green, The tawny stubble clad the hill, And August hung her smoky screen Above the valleys, hot and still. No life was in the fields that day; My steps were safe from curious eyes: I wandered where, in churchyard clay, The dust of love and beauty lies. Around me thrust the nameless graves Their fatal ridges, side by side, So green, they seemed but grassy waves, Yet quiet as the dead they hide. And o'er each pillow of repose Some innocent memento grew, Of pansy, pink, or lowly rose, Or hyssop, lavender, and rue. What flower is hers, the maiden bride? What sacred plant protects her bed? I saw, the greenest mound beside, A rose of dark and lurid red. An eye of fierce demoniac stain, It mocked my calm and chastened grief; I tore it, stung with sudden pain, And stamped in earth each bloody leaf. And down upon that trampled grave In recklessness my body cast: “Give back the life I could not save, Or give deliverance from the Past!” But something gently touched my cheek, Caressing while its touch reproved: A rose, all white and snowy-meek, It grew upon the dust I loved! A breeze the holy blossom pressed Upon my lips: Dear Saint, I cried, Still blooms the white rose, in my breast, Of Love, that Death has sanctified! 1860. AUTUMNAL DREAMS I When the maple turns to crimson And the sassafras to gold; When the gentian 's in the meadow, And the aster on the wold; When the noon is lapped in vapor, And the night is frosty-cold: II When the chestnut-burs are opened, And the acorns drop like hail, And the drowsy air is startled With the thumping of the flail,— With the drumming of the partridge And the whistle of the quail: III Through the rustling woods I wander, Through the jewels of the year, From the yellow uplands calling, Seeking her that still is dear: She is near me in the autumn, She, the beautiful, is near. IV Through the smoke of burning summer, When the weary winds are still, I can see her in the valley, I can hear her on the hill,— In the splendor of the woodlands, In the whisper of the rill. V For the shores of Earth and Heaven Meet, and mingle in the blue: She can wander down the glory To the places that she knew, Where the happy lovers wandered In the days when life was true. VI So I think, when days are sweetest, And the world is wholly fair, She may sometime steal upon me Through the dimness of the air, With the cross upon her bosom And the amaranth in her hair. VII Once to meet her, ah! to meet her, And to hold her gently fast Till I blessed her, till she blessed me,— That were happiness, at last: That were bliss beyond our meetings In the autumns of the Past! 1860. IN WINTER The valley stream is frozen, The hills are cold and bare, And the wild white bees of winter Swarm in the darkened air. I look on the naked forest: Was it ever green in June? Did it burn with gold and crimson In the dim autumnal noon? I look on the barren meadow: Was it ever heaped with hay? Did it hide the grassy cottage Where the skylark's children lay? I look on the desolate garden: Is it true the rose was there? And the woodbine's musky blossoms, And the hyacinth's purple hair? I look on my heart, and marvel If Love were ever its own,— If the spring of promise brightened, And the summer of passion shone? Is the stem of bliss but withered, And the root survives the blast? Are the seeds of the Future sleeping Under the leaves of the Past? Ah, yes! for a thousand Aprils The frozen germs shall grow, And the dews of a thousand summers Wait in the womb of the snow! 1860. YOUNG LOVE We are not old, we are not cold, Our hearts are warm and tender yet; Our arms are eager to enfold More bounteous love than we have met. Still many another heart lays bare Its secret chamber to our eyes, Though dim with passion's lurid air, Or pure as morns of Paradise. They give the love, whose glory lifts Desire beyond the realm of sense; They make us rich with lavish gifts, The wealth of noble confidence. We must be happy, must be proud, So crowned with human trust and truth; But ah! the love that first we vowed, The dear religion of our youth! Voluptuous bloom and fragrance rare The summer to its rose may bring; Far sweeter to the wooing air The hidden violet of the spring. Still, still that lovely ghost appears, Too fair, too pure, to bid depart; No riper love of later years Can steal its beauty from the heart. O splendid sun that shone above! O green magnificence of Earth! Born once into that land of love, No life can know a second birth. Dear, boyish heart, that trembled so With bashful fear and fond unrest,— More frightened than a dove, to know Another bird within its nest! Sharp thrills of doubt, wild hopes that came, Fond words addressed,—each word a pang: Then—hearts, baptized in heavenly flame, How like the morning stars ye sang! Love bound ye with his holiest link, The faith in each that ask no more, And led ye from the sacred brink Of mysteries he held in store. Love led ye, children, from the bowers Where Strength and Beauty find his crown: Ye were not ripe for mortal flowers; God's angel brought an amaranth down. Our eyes are dim with fruitless tears, Our eyes are dim, our hearts are sore: That lost religion of our years Comes never, never, nevermore! 1856. THE CHAPEL Like one who leaves the trampled street For some cathedral, cool and dim, Where he can hear in music beat The heart of prayer, that beats for him; And sees the common light of day, Through painted panes, transfigured, shine, And casts his human woes away, In presence of the Woe Divine: So I, from life's tormenting themes, Turn where the silent chapel lies, Whose windows burn with vanished dreams, Whose altar-lights are memories. There, watched by pitying cherubim, In sacred hush, I rest awhile, Till solemn sounds of harp and hymn Begin to sweep the haunted aisle: A hymn that once but breathed complaint, And breathes but resignation now, Since God has heard the pleading saint, And laid His hand upon my brow. Restored and comforted, I go To grapple with my tasks again; Through silent worship taught to know The blessed peace that follows pain. 1860. IF LOVE SHOULD COME AGAIN If Love should come again, I ask my heart In tender tremors, not unmixed with pain, Couldst thou be calm, nor feel thine ancient smart, If Love should come again? Couldst thou unbar the chambers where his nest So long was made, and made, alas, in vain, Nor with embarrassed welcome chill thy guest, If Love should come again? Would Love his ruined quarters recognize, Where shrouded pictures of the Past remain, And gently turn them with forgiving eyes, If Love should come again? Would bliss, in milder type, spring up anew, As silent craters with the scarlet stain Of flowers repeat the lava's ancient hue, If Love should come again? Would Fate, relenting, sheathe the cruel blade Whereby the angel of thy youth was slain That thou might'st all possess him, unafraid, If Love should come again? In vain I ask: my heart makes no reply, But echoes evermore the sweet refrain; Till, trembling lest it seem a wish, I sigh: If Love should come again. “The darkness and the twilight have an end,” Said Ernest, as he laid the book aside, And, with a tenderness he could not hide, Smiled, seeing in the eyes of wife and friend The same soft dew that made his own so dim. My heart was strangely moved, but not for him. The holy night, the stars that twinkled faint, Serfs of the regnant moon, the slumbering trees And silvery hills, recalled fair memories Of her I knew, his life's translated saint, Who seemed too sacred now, too far removed, To be by him lamented or beloved. And yet she stood, I knew, by Ernest's side Invisible, a glory in the heart, A light of peace, the inner counterpart Of that which round us poured its radiant tide. We sat in silence, till a wind, astray From some uneasy planet, shook the vines And sprinkled us with snow of eglantines. The laurels rustled as it passed away, And, million-tongued, the woodland whisper crept Of leaves that turned in sleep, from tree to tree All down the lawn, and once again they slept. Then Edith from her tender fantasy Awoke, yet still her pensive posture kept, Her white hands motionless upon her knee, Her eyes upon a star that sparkled through The mesh of leaves, and hummed a wandering air, (As if the music of her thoughts it were,) Low, sweet, and sad, until to words it grew That made it sweeter,—words that Ernest knew: Love, I follow, follow thee, Wipe thine eyes and thou shalt see: Sorrow makes thee blind to me. I am with thee, blessing, blest; Let thy doubts be laid to rest: Rise, and take me to thy breast! In thy bliss my steps behold: Stretch thine arms and bliss enfold: 'T is thy sorrow makes me cold. Life is good, and life is fair, Love awaits thee everywhere: Love! is Love's immortal prayer. Live for love, and thou shalt be, Loving others, true to me: Love, I follow, follow thee! Thus Edith sang: the stars heard, and the night, The happy spirits, leaning from the wall Of Heaven, the saints, and God above them all, Heard what she sang. She ceased: her brow was bright With other splendor than the moon's: she rose, Gave each a hand, and silently we trod The dry, white gravel and the dewy sod, And silently we parted for repose. [THIRD EVENING] THIRD EVENING For days before, the wild-dove cooed for rain. The sky had been too bright, the world too fair. We knew such loveliness could not remain: We heard its ruin by the flattering air Foretold, that o'er the field so sweetly blew, Yet came, at night, a banshee, moaning through The chimney's throat, and at the window wailed: We heard the tree-toad trill his piercing note: The sound seemed near us, when, on farms remote, The supper-horn the scattered workmen hailed: Above the roof the eastward-pointing vane Stood fixed: and still the wild-dove cooed for rain. So, when the morning came, and found no fire Upon her hearth, and wrapped her shivering form In cloud, and rising winds in many a gyre Of dust foreran the footsteps of the storm, And woods grew dark, and flowery meadows chill, And gray annihilation smote the hill, I said to Ernest: “'T was my plan, you see: Two days to Nature, and the third to me. For you must stay, perforce: the day is doomed. No visitors shall yonder valley find, Except the spirits of the rain and wind: Here you must bide, my friends, with me entombed In this dim crypt, where shelved around us lie The mummied authors.” “Place me, when I die,” Laughed Ernest, “in as fair a catacomb, I shall not call posterity unjust, That leaves my bones in Shakespeare's, Goethe's home, Like king and beggar mixed in Memphian dust. But you are right: this day we well may give To you, dear Philip, and to those who stand Protecting Nature with a jealous hand, At once her subjects and her haughty lords; Since, in the breath of their immortal words Alone, she first begins to speak and live.” I know not, if that day of dreary rain Was not the happiest of the happy three. For Nature gives, but takes away again: Sound, odor, color—blossom, cloud, and tree Divide and scatter in a thousand rays Our individual being: but, in days Of gloom, the wandering senses crowding come To the close circle of the heart. So we, Cosily nestled in the library, Enjoyed each other and the warmth of home. Each window was a picture of the rain: Blown by the wind, tormented, wet, and gray, Losing itself in cloud, the landscape lay; Or wavered, blurred, behind the streaming pane; Or, with a sudden struggle, shook away Its load, and like a foundering ship arose Distinct and dark above the driving spray, Until a fiercer onset came, to close The hopeless day. The roses writhed about Their stakes, the tall laburnums to and fro Rocked in the gusts, the flowers were beaten low, And from his pygmy house the wren looked out With dripping bill: each living creature fled, To seek some sheltering cover for its head: Yet colder, drearier, wilder as it blew We drew the closer, and the happier grew. She with her needle, he with pipe and book, My guests contented sat: my cheerful dame, Intent on household duties, went and came, And I unto my childless bosom took The little two-year Arthur, Ernest's child, A darling boy, to both his parents true,— With father's brow, and mother's eyes of blue, And the same dimpled beauty when he smiled. Ah me! the father's heart within me woke: The child that never was, I seemed to hold: The withered tenderness that bloomed of old In vain, revived when little Arthur spoke Of “Papa Philip!” and his balmy kiss Renewed lost yearnings for a father's bliss. And something glittered in the boy's bright hair: I kissed him back, but turned away my head To hide the pang I would not have thee share, Dear wife! from whom the dearest promise fled. God cannot chide so sacred a despair, But still I dream that somewhere there must be The spirit of a child that waits for me. And evening fell, and Arthur, rosy-limbed And snowy-gowned, in human beauty sweet, Came pattering up with little naked feet To kiss the good-night cup, that overbrimmed With love two fathers and two mothers gave. The steady rain against the windows drave, And round the house the noises of the night Mixed in a lulling music: dry old wood Burned on the hearth in leaps of ruddy light, And on the table purple beakers stood Of harmless wine, from grapes that ripened on The sunniest hillside of the smooth Garonne. When Arthur slept, and doors were closed, and we Sat folded in a sweeter privacy Than even the secret-loving moon bestows, Spoke Ernest: “Edith, shall I read the rest?” She, while the spirit of a happy rose Visited her cheeks, consenting smiled, and pressed The hand he gave. “With what I now shall read,” He added, “Philip, you must be content. No further runs my journal, nor, indeed, Beyond this chapter is there further need; Because the gift of Song was chiefly lent To give consoling music for the joys We lack, and not for those which we possess: I now no longer need that gift, to bless My heart,—your heart, my Edith, and your boy's!” Therewith he read: the fingers of the rain In light staccatos on the window played, Mixed with the flame's contented hum, and made Low harmonies to suit the varied strain. THE RETURN OF SPRING Have I passed through Death's unconscious birth, In a dream the midnight bare? I look on another and fairer Earth: I breathe a wondrous air! A spirit of beauty walks the hills, A spirit of love the plain; The shadows are bright, and the sunshine fills The air with a diamond rain! Before my vision the glories swim, To the dance of a tune unheard: Is an angel singing where woods are dim, Or is it an amorous bird? Is it a spike of azure flowers, Deep in the meadows seen, Or is it the peacock's neck, that towers Out of the spangled green? Is a white dove glancing across the blue, Or an opal taking wing? For my soul is dazzled through and through, With the splendor of the Spring. Is it she that shines, as never before, The tremulous hills above,— Or the heart within me, awake once more To the dawning light of love? 1860. MORNING Along the east, where late the dark impended, A dusky gleam is born: The watches of the night are ended, And heaven foretells the morn! The hills of home, no longer hurled together, In one wide blotch of night, Lift up their heads through misty ether, Distinct in rising light. Then, after pangs of darkness slowly dying, O'er the delivered world Comes Morn, with every banner flying And every sail unfurled! So long the night, so chill, so blank and dreary, I thought the sun was dead; But yonder burn his beacons cheery On peaks of cloudy red: And yonder fly his scattered golden arrows, And smite the hills with day, While Night her vain dominion narrows And westward wheels away. A sweeter air revives the new creation, The dews are tears of bliss, And Earth, in amorous palpitation, Receives her bridegroom's kiss. Bathed in the morning, let my heart surrender The doubts that darkness gave, And rise to meet the advancing splendor— O Night! no more thy slave. I breathe at last, thy gloomy reign forgetting, Thy weary watches done, Thy last pale star behind me setting, The freedom of the sun! 1860. THE VISION I She came, long absent from my side, And absent from my dreams, she came, The earthly and the heavenly bride, In maiden beauty glorified: She looked upon me, angel-eyed: She called me by my name. II But I, whose heart to meet her sprang And shook the fragile house of dreams, Stood, smitten with a guilty pang: In other groves and temples rang The songs that once for her I sang, By woods and faery streams. III Her eyes had power to lift my head, And, timorous as a truant child, I met the sacred light they shed, The light of heaven around her spread; She read my face; no word she said: I only saw she smiled. IV “Canst thou forgive me, Angel mine,” I cried; “that Love at last beguiled My heart to build a second shrine? See, still I kneel and weep at thine, But I am human, thou divine!” Still silently she smiled. V “Dost undivided worship claim, To keep thine altar undefiled? Or must I bear thy tender blame, And in thy pardon feel my shame, Whene'er I breathe another name?” She looked at me, and smiled. VI “Speak, speak!” and then my tears came fast, My troubled heart with doubt grew wild: “Will 't vex the love, which still thou hast, To know that I have peace at last?” And from my dream the vision passed, And still, in passing, smiled. 1860. LOVE RETURNED I He was a boy when first we met; His eyes were mixed of dew and fire, And on his candid brow was set The sweetness of a chaste desire. But in his veins the pulses beat Of passion, waiting for its wing, As ardent veins of summer heat Throb through the innocence of spring. II As manhood came, his stature grew, And fiercer burned his restless eyes, Until I trembled, as he drew From wedded hearts their young disguise. Like wind-fed flame his ardor rose, And brought, like flame, a stormy rain: In tumult, sweeter than repose, He tossed the souls of joy and pain. III So many years of absence change! I knew him not when he returned: His step was slow, his brow was strange, His quiet eye no longer burned. When at my heart I heard his knock, No voice within his right confessed: I could not venture to unlock Its chambers to an alien guest. IV Then, at the threshold, spent and worn With fruitless travel, down he lay. And I beheld the gleams of morn On his reviving beauty play. I knelt, and kissed his holy lips, I washed his feet with pious care; And from my life the long eclipse Drew off, and left his sunshine there. V He burns no more with youthful fire; He melts no more in foolish tears; Serene and sweet, his eyes inspire The steady faith of balanced years. His folded wings no longer thrill, But in some peaceful flight of prayer: He nestles in my heart so still, I scarcely feel his presence there. VI O Love, that stern probation o'er, Thy calmer blessing is secure! Thy beauteous feet shall stray no more, Thy peace and patience shall endure! The lightest wind deflowers the rose, The rainbow with the sun departs, But thou art centred in repose, And rooted in my heart of hearts! 1860. A WOMAN I She is a woman: therefore, I a man, In so much as I love her. Could I more, Then I were more a man. Our natures ran Together, brimming full, not flooding o'er The banks of life, and evermore will run In one full stream until our days are done. II She is a woman, but of spirit brave To bear the loss of girlhood's giddy dreams; The regal mistress, not the yielding slave Of her ideal, spurning that which seems For that which is, and, as her fancies fall, Smiling: the truth of love outweighs them all. III She looks through life, and with a balance just Weighs men and things, beholding as they are The lives of others: in the common dust She finds the fragments of the ruined star: Proud, with a pride all feminine and sweet, No path can soil the whiteness of her feet. IV The steady candor of her gentle eyes Strikes dead deceit, laughs vanity away; She hath no room for petty jealousies, Where Faith and Love divide their tender sway. Of either sex she owns the nobler part: Man's honest brow and woman's faithful heart. V She is a woman, who, if Love were guide, Would climb to power, or in obscure content Sit down: accepting fate with changeless pride— A reed in calm, in storm a staff unbent: No pretty plaything, ignorant of life, But Man's true mother, and his equal wife. 1860. THE COUNT OF GLEICHEN I read that story of the Saxon knight, Who, leaving spouse and feudal fortress, made The Cross of Christ his guerdon in the fight, And joined the last Crusade. Whom, in the chase on Damietta's sands Estrayed, the Saracens in ambush caught, And unto Cairo, to the Soldan's hands, A wretched captive brought: Whom then the Soldan's child, a damsel brave, Saw, pitied, comforted, and made him free, And with him flew, herself a willing slave In Love's captivity. I read how he to bless her love was fain, To whom his renovated life he owed, Yet with a pang the towers beheld again Where still his wife abode: The wife whom first he loved: would she not scorn The second bride he could not choose but wed, The second mother to his children, born In her divided bed? Lo! at his castle's foot the noble dame With tears of blessing, holy, undefiled By human pain, received him when he came, And kissed the Soldan's child! My tears were on the pages as I read The touching close: I made the story mine, Within whose heart, long plighted to the dead, Love built his living shrine. I too had dared, a captive in the land, To pay with love the love that broke my chain: Would she, who waited, stretch the pardoning hand, When I returned again? Would she, my freedom and my bliss to know, With my disloyalty be reconciled, And from her bower in Eden look below, And bless the Soldan's child? For she is lost: but she, the later bride, Who came my ruined fortune to restore, Back from the desert wanders at my side, And leads me home once more. If human love, she sighs, could move a wife The holiest sacrifice of love to make, Then the transfigured angel of thy life Is happier for thy sake! 1860. BEFORE THE BRIDAL Now the night is overpast, And the mist is cleared away: On my barren life at last Breaks the bright, reluctant day. Day of payment for the wrong I was doomed so long to bear; Day of promise, day of song, Day that makes the future fair! Let me wake to bliss alone: Let me bury every fear: What I prayed for, is my own; What was distant, now is near. For the happy hour that waits No reproachful shade shall bring, And I hear forgiving Fates In the happy bells that ring. Leave the song that now is mute, For the sweeter song begun: Leave the blossom for the fruit, And the rainbow for the sun! 1860. POSSESSION I “It was our wedding-day A month ago,” dear heart, I hear you say. If months, or years, or ages since have passed, I know not: I have ceased to question Time. I only know that once there pealed a chime Of joyous bells, and then I held you fast, And all stood back, and none my right denied, And forth we walked: the world was free and wide Before us. Since that day I count my life: the Past is washed away. II It was no dream, that vow: It was the voice that woke me from a dream,— A happy dream, I think; but I am waking now, And drink the splendor of a sun supreme That turns the mist of former tears to gold. Within these arms I hold The fleeting promise, chased so long in vain: Ah, weary bird! thou wilt not fly again: Thy wings are clipped, thou canst no more depart,— Thy nest is builded in my heart! III I was the crescent; thou The silver phantom of the perfect sphere, Held in its bosom: in one glory now Our lives united shine, and many a year— Not the sweet moon of bridal only—we One lustre, ever at the full, shall be: One pure and rounded light, one planet whole, One life developed, one completed soul! For I in thee, and thou in me, Unite our cloven halves of destiny. IV God knew His chosen time: He bade me slowly ripen to my prime, And from my boughs withheld the promised fruit, Till storm and sun gave vigor to the root. Secure, O Love! secure Thy blessing is: I have thee day and night: Thou art become my blood, my life, my light: God's mercy thou, and therefore shalt endure! 1860. UNDER THE MOON I From you and home I sleep afar, Under the light of a lonely star, Under the moon that marvels why Away from you and home I lie. Ah! love no language can declare, The hovering warmth, the tender care, The yielding, sweet, invisible air That clasps your bosom, and fans your cheek With the breath of words I cannot speak,— Such love I give, such warmth impart: The fragrance of a blossomed heart. II The moon looks in upon my bed, Her yearning glory lays my head, And round me clings, a lonely light, The aureole of the winter night; But in my heart a gentle pain, A balmier splendor in my brain, Lead me beyond the frosty plane,— Lead me afar, to mellower skies, Where under the moon a palace lies; Where under the moon our bed is made, Half in splendor and half in shade. III The marble flags of the corridor Through open windows meet the floor, And Moorish arches in darkness rise Against the gleam of the silver skies: Beyond, in flakes of starry light, A fountain prattles to the night, And dusky cypresses, withdrawn In silent conclave, stud the lawn; While mystic woodlands, more remote, In seas of airy silver float, So hung in heaven, the stars that set Seem glossy leaves the dew has wet On topmost boughs, and sparkling yet. IV In from the terraced garden blows The spicy soul of the tuberose, As if 't were the odor of strains that pour From the nightingale's throat as never before; For he sings not now of wounding thorn, He sings as the lark in the golden morn,— A song of joy, a song of bliss, Passionate notes that clasp and kiss, Perfect peace and perfect pride, Love rewarded and satisfied, For I see you, darling, at my side. V I see you, darling, at my side: I clasp you closer, in sacred pride. I shut my eyes, my senses fail, Becalmed by Night's ambrosial gale. Softer than dews the planets weep, Descends a sweeter peace than sleep; All wandering sounds and motions die In the silent glory of the sky; But, as the moon goes down the West, Your heart, against my happy breast, Says in its beating: Love is Rest. 1859. THE MYSTIC SUMMER 'T is not the dropping of the flower, The blush of fruit upon the tree, Though summer ripens, hour by hour, The garden's sweet maternity: 'T is not that birds have ceased to build, And wait their brood with tender care; That corn is golden in the field, And clover balm is in the air;— Not these the season's splendor bring, And crowd with life the happy year, Nor yet, where yonder fountains sing, The blaze of sunshine, hot and clear. In thy full womb, O Summer! lies A secret hope, a joy unsung, Held in the hush of these calm skies, And trembling on the forest's tongue. The lands of harvest throb anew In shining pulses, far away; The Night distils a dearer dew, And sweeter eyelids has the Day. And not in vain the peony burns, In bursting globes, her crimson fire, Her incense-dropping ivory urns The lily lifts in many a spire: And not in vain the tulips clash In revelry the cups they hold Of fiery wine, until they dash With ruby streaks the splendid gold! Send down your roots the mystic charm That warms and flushes all your flowers, And with the summer's touch disarm The thraldom of the under powers, Until, in caverns, buried deep, Strange fragrance reach the diamond's home, And murmurs of the garden sweep The houses of the frighted gnome! For, piercing through their black repose, And shooting up beyond the sun, I see that Tree of Life, which rose Before the eyes of Solomon: Its boughs, that, in the light of God, Their bright, innumerous leaves display,— Whose hum of life is borne abroad By winds that shake the dead away. And, trembling on a branch afar, The topmost nursling of the skies, I see my bud, the fairest star That ever dawned for watching eyes. Unnoticed on the boundless tree, Its fragrant promise fills the air; Its little bell expands, for me, A tent of silver, lily-fair. All life to that one centre tends; All joy and beauty thence outflow; Her sweetest gifts the summer spends, To teach that sweeter bud to blow. So, compassed by the vision's gleam, In trembling hope, from day to day As in some bright, bewildering dream, The mystic summer wanes away. 1859. THE FATHER The fateful hour, when Death stood by And stretched his threatening hand in vain, Is over now, and Life's first cry Speaks feeble triumph through its pain. But yesterday, and thee the Earth Inscribed not on her mighty scroll: To-day she opes the gate of birth, And gives the spheres another soul. But yesterday, no fruit from me The rising winds of Time had hurled: To-day, a father,—can it be A child of mine is in the world? I look upon the little frame, As helpless on my arm it lies: Thou giv'st me, child, a father's name, God's earliest name in Paradise. Like Him, creator too I stand: His Power and Mystery seem more near; Thou giv'st me honor in the land, And giv'st my life duration here. But love, to-day, is more than pride; Love sees his star of triumph shine, For Life nor Death can now divide The souls that wedded breathe in thine: Mine and thy mother's, whence arose The copy of my face in thee; And as thine eyelids first unclose, My own young eyes look up to me. Look on me, child, once more, once more, Even with those weak, unconscious eyes; Stretch the small hands that help implore; Salute me with thy wailing cries! This is the blessing and the prayer A father's sacred place demands: Ordain me, darling, for thy care, And lead me with thy helpless hands! 1858. THE MOTHER Paler, and yet a thousand times more fair Than in thy girlhood's freshest bloom, art thou: A softer sun-flush tints thy golden hair, A sweeter grace adorns thy gentle brow. Lips that shall call thee “mother!” at thy breast Feed the young life, wherein thy nature feels Its dear fulfilment: little hands are pressed On the white fountain Love alone unseals. Look down, and let Life's tender daybreak throw A second radiance on thy ripened hour: Retrace thine own forgotten advent so, And in the bud behold thy perfect flower. Nay, question not: whatever lies beyond God will dispose. Sit thus, Madonna mine, For thou art haloed with a love as fond As Jewish Mary gave the Child Divine. I lay my own proud title at thy feet; Thine the first, holiest right to love shalt be: Though in his heart our wedded pulses beat, His sweetest life our darling draws from thee. The father in his child beholds this truth, His perfect manhood has assumed its reign: Thou wear'st anew the roses of thy youth,— The mother in her child is born again. 1858. Thus came the Poet's Journal to an end. His heart's completed music ceased to flow From Ernest's lips: the tale I wished to know Was wholly mine. “I am content, dear friend,” I said: “to me no voice can be obscure Wherein your nature speaks: the chords I hear, Too far and frail to strike a stranger's ear.” With that, I bowed to Edith's forehead pure, And kissed her with a brother's blameless kiss: “To you the fortune of these days I owe, My other Ernest, like him most in this, That you can hear the cries of ancient woe With holy pity free from any blame Of jealous love, and find your highest bliss To know, through you his life's fulfilment came.” “And through him, mine,” the woman's heart replied: For Love's humility is Love's true pride. “These are your sweetest poems, and your best,” To him I said. “I know not,” answered he, “They are my truest. I have ceased to be The ambitious knight of Song, that shook his crest In public tilts: the sober hermit I, Whose evening songs but few approach to hear,— Who, if those few should cease to lend an ear, Would sing them to the forest and the sky Contented: singing for myself alone. No fear that any poet dies unknown, Whose songs are written in the hearts that know And love him, though their partial verdict show The tenderness that moves the critic's blame. Those few have power to lift his name above Forgetfulness, to grant that noblest fame Which sets its trumpet to the lips of Love!” “Nay, then,” said I, “you are already crowned. If your ambition in the loving pride Of us, your friends, is cheaply satisfied, We are those trumpets: do you hear them sound?” And Edith smilingly together wound Light stems of ivy to a garland fair, And pressed it archly on her husband's hair; But he, with earnest voice, though in his eyes A happy laughter shone, protesting, said: “Respect, dear friends, the Muse's sanctities, Nor mock, with wreaths upon a living head, The holy laurels of the deathless Dead. Crown Love, crown Truth when first her brow appears, And crown the Hero when his deeds are done: The Poet's leaves are gathered one by one, In the slow process of the doubtful years. Who seeks too eagerly, he shall not find: Who, seeking not, pursues with single mind Art's lofty aim, to him will she accord, At her appointed time, the sure reward.” The tall clock, standing sentry in the hall, Struck midnight: on the panes no longer beat The weary storm: the wind began to fall, And through the breaking darkness glimmered, sweet With tender stars, the flying gleams of sky. “Come, Edith, lend your voice to crown the night, And give the new day sunny break,” said I: She listening first in self-deceiving plight Of young maternal trouble, for a cry From Arthur's crib, sat down in happy calm, And sang to Ernest's heart his own thanksgiving psalm. Thou who sendest sun and rain, Thou who spendest bliss and pain, Good with bounteous hand bestowing, Evil for Thy will allowing,— Though Thy ways we cannot see, All is just that comes from Thee. In the peace of hearts at rest, In the child at mother's breast, In the lives that now surround us, In the deaths that sorely wound us, Though we may not understand, Father, we behold Thy hand! Hear the happy hymn we raise; Take the love which is Thy praise; Give content in each condition; Bend our hearts in sweet submission, And Thy trusting children prove Worthy of the Father's love! 1860. OCCASIONAL POEMS 1861–1865 THROUGH BALTIMORE I 'T was Friday morn: the train drew near The city and the shore. Far through the sunshine, soft and clear, We saw the dear old flag appear, And in our hearts arose a cheer For Baltimore. II Across the broad Patapsco's wave, Old Fort McHenry bore The starry banner of the brave, As when our fathers went to save, Or in the trenches find a grave At Baltimore. III Before us, pillared in the sky, We saw the statue soar Of Washington, serene and high:— Could traitors view that form, nor fly? Could patriots see, nor gladly die For Baltimore? IV “O city of our country's song! By that swift aid we bore When sorely pressed, receive the throng Who go to shield our flag from wrong, And give us welcome, warm and strong, In Baltimore!” V We had no arms; as friends we came, As brothers evermore, To rally round one sacred name,— The charter of our power and fame: We never dreamed of guilt and shame In Baltimore. VI The coward mob upon us fell: McHenry's flag they tore: Surprised, borne backward by the swell, Beat down with mad, inhuman yell, Before us yawned a traitorous hell In Baltimore! VII The streets our soldier-fathers trod Blushed with their children's gore; We saw the craven rulers nod, And dip in blood the civic rod— Shall such things be, O righteous God, In Baltimore? VIII No, never! By that outrage black, A solemn oath we swore. To bring the Keystone's thousands back, Strike down the dastards who attack, And leave a red and fiery track Through Baltimore! IX Bow down, in haste, thy guilty head! God's wrath is swift and sore: The sky with gathering bolts is red,— Cleanse from thy skirts the slaughter shed, Or make thyself an ashen bed, O Baltimore! April, 1861. TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE That late, in half-despair, I said: “The Nation's ancient life is dead; Her arm is weak, her blood is cold; She hugs the peace that gives her gold,— The shameful peace, that sees expire Each beacon-light of patriot fire, And makes her court a traitors' den,”— Forgive me this, my countrymen! O, in your long forbearance grand, Slow to suspect the treason planned, Enduring wrong, yet hoping good For sake of olden brotherhood, How grander, how sublimer far At the roused Eagle's call ye are, Leaping from slumber to the fight, For Freedom and for Chartered Right! Throughout the land there goes a cry; A sudden splendor fills the sky: From every hill the banners burst, Like buds by April breezes nurst; In every hamlet, home, and mart, The fire-beat of a single heart Keeps time to strains whose pulses mix Our blood with that of Seventy-Six! The shot whereby the old flag fell From Sumter's battered citadel Struck down the lines of party creed And made ye One in soul and deed,— One mighty People, stern and strong To crush the consummated wrong; Indignant with the wrath whose rod Smites as the awful sword of God! The cup is full! They thought ye blind: The props of state they undermined; Abused your trust, your strength defied, And stained the Nation's name of pride. Now lift to Heaven your loyal brows, Swear once again your fathers' vows, And cut through traitor hearts a track To nobler fame and freedom back! Draw forth your million blades as one; Complete the battle then begun! God fights with ye, and overhead Floats the dear banner of your dead. They, and the glories of the Past, The Future, dawning dim and vast, And all the holiest hopes of Man, Are beaming triumph in your van! Slow to resolve, be swift to do! Teach ye the False how fight the True! How bucklered Perfidy shall feel In her black heart the Patriot's steel; How sure the bolt that Justice wings; How weak the arm a traitor brings; How mighty they, who steadfast stand For Freedom's Flag and Freedom's Land! April 30, 1861. SCOTT AND THE VETERAN I An old and crippled veteran to the War Department came; He sought the Chief who led him on many a field of fame,— The Chief who shouted “Forward!” where'er his banner rose, And bore its stars in triumph behind the flying foes. II “Have you forgotten, General,” the battered soldier cried, “The days of Eighteen Hundred Twelve, when I was at your side? Have you forgotten Johnson, that fought at Lundy's Lane? 'T is true, I'm old and pensioned, but I want to fight again.” III “Have I forgotten?” said the Chief; “my brave old soldier, No! And here 's the hand I gave you then, and let it tell you so: But you have done your share, my friend; you 're crippled, old, and gray, And we have need of younger arms and fresher blood to-day.” IV “But, General,” cried the veteran, a flush upon his brow, “The very men who fought with us, they say, are traitors now; They 've torn the flag of Lundy's Lane,—our old red, white, and blue; And while a drop of blood is left, I'll show that drop is true. V “I'm not so weak but I can strike, and I 've a good old gun To get the range of traitors' hearts, and pick them, one by one. Your Minié rifles, and such arms, it a'n't worth while to try: I could n't get the hang o' them, but I'll keep my powder dry!” VI “God bless you, comrade!” said the Chief; “God bless your loyal heart! But younger men are in the field, and claim to have their part: They'll plant our sacred banner in each rebellious town, And woe, henceforth, to any hand that dares to pull it down!” VII “But, General,”—still persisting, the weeping veteran cried,— “I'm young enough to follow, so long as you 're my guide; And some, you know, must bite the dust, and that, at least, can I,— So, give the young ones place to fight, but me a place to die! VIII “If they should fire on Pickens, let the Colonel in command Put me upon the rampart, with the flagstaff in my hand: No odds how hot the cannon-smoke, or how the shells may fly; I'll hold the Stars and Stripes aloft, and hold them till I die! IX “I'm ready, General, so you let a post to me be given, Where Washington can see me, as he looks from highest heaven, And say to Putnam at his side, or, may be, General Wayne; ‘There stands old Billy Johnson, that fought at Lundy's Lane!’ X “And when the fight is hottest, before the traitors fly, When shell and ball are screeching and bursting in the sky, If any shot should hit me, and lay me on my face, My soul would go to Washington's, and not to Arnold's place!” May, 1861. MARCH With rushing winds and gloomy skies The dark and stubborn Winter dies: Far-off, unseen, Spring faintly cries, Bidding her earliest child arise: March! By streams still held in icy snare, On southern hillsides, melting bare, O'er fields that motley colors wear, That summons fills the changeful air: March! What though conflicting seasons make Thy days their field, they woo or shake The sleeping lids of Life awake, And hope is stronger for thy sake, March! Then from thy mountains, ribbed with snow, Once more thy rousing bugle blow, And East and West, and to and fro, Announce thy coming to the foe, March! Say to the picket, chilled and numb; Say to the camp's impatient hum; Say to the trumpet and the drum: “Lift up your hearts, I come! I come!” March! Cry to the waiting hosts that stray On sandy seasides, far away, By marshy isle and gleaming bay, Where Southern March is Northern May: March! Announce thyself with welcome noise, Where Glory's victor-eagles poise Above the proud, heroic boys Of Iowa and Illinois: March! Then down the long Potomac's line Shout like a storm on hills of pine, Till ramrods ring and bayonets shine: “Advance! The Chieftain's call is mine,— March!” March 1, 1862. EUPHORION “I will not longer Earth-bound linger: Loosen your hold on Hand and on ringlet, Girdle and garment; Leave them: they're mine!” “Bethink thee, bethink thee To whom thou belongest! Say, wouldst thou wound us, Rudely destroying Threefold the beauty,— Mine, his, and thine?” Faust, Second Part. Nay, fold your arms, beloved Friends, Above the hearts that vainly beat! Or catch the rainbow where it bends, And find your darling at its feet; Or fix the fountain's varying shape, The sunset-cloud's elusive dye, The speech of winds that round the cape Make music to the sea and sky: So may you summon from the air The loveliness that vanished hence, And Twilight give his beauteous hair, And Morning give his countenance, And Life about his being clasp Her rosy girdle once again:— But no! let go your stubborn grasp On some wild hope, and take your pain! For, through the crystal of your tears, His love and beauty fairer shine; The shadows of advancing years Draw back, and leave him all divine. And Death, that took him, cannot claim The smallest vesture of his birth,— The little life, a dancing flame That hovered o'er the hills of earth,— The finer soul, that unto ours A subtle perfume seemed to be, Like incense blown from April flowers Beside the scarred and stormy tree,— The wondering eyes, that ever saw Some fleeting mystery in the air, And felt the stars of evening draw His heart to silence, childhood's prayer! Our suns were all too fierce for him; Our rude winds pierced him through and through: But Heaven has valleys cool and dim, And boscage sweet with starry dew. There knowledge breathes in balmy air, Not wrung, as here, with panting breast: The wisdom born of toil you share; But he, the wisdom born of rest. For every picture here that slept, A living canvas is unrolled; The silent harp he might have swept Leans to his touch its strings of gold. Believe, dear Friends, they murmur still Some sweet accord to those you play, That happier winds of Eden thrill With echoes of the earthly lay; That he, for every triumph won, Whereto your poet-souls aspire, Sees opening in that perfect sun, Another blossom's bud of fire! Each song, of Love and Sorrow born, Another flower to crown your boy,— Each shadow here his ray of morn, Till Grief shall clasp the hand of Joy! 1862. A THOUSAND YEARS A thousand years! Through storm and fire, With varying fate, the work has grown, Till Alexander crowns the spire, Where Rurik laid the corner-stone. The chieftain's sword, that could not rust, But bright in constant battle grew, Raised to the world a throne august,— A nation grander than he knew. Nor he, alone; but those who have, Through faith or deed, an equal part: The subtle brain of Yaroslav, Vladimir's arm and Nikon's heart: The later hands, that built so well The work sublime which these began, And up from base to pinnacle Wrought out the Empire's mighty plan. All these, to-day, are crowned anew, And rule in splendor where they trod, While Russia's children throng to view Her holy cradle, Novgorod. From Volga's banks; from Dwina's side; From pine-clad Ural, dark and long; Or where the foaming Terek's tide Leaps down from Kasbek, bright with song: From Altaï's chain of mountain-cones; Mongolian deserts, far and free; And lands that bind, through changing zones, The Eastern and the Western sea! To every race she gives a home, And creeds and laws enjoy her shade, Till, far beyond the dreams of Rome, Her Cæsar's mandate is obeyed. She blends the virtues they impart, And holds, within her life combined, The patient faith of Asia's heart,— The force of Europe's restless mind. She bids the nomad's wanderings cease; She binds the wild marauder fast; Her ploughshares turn to homes of peace The battle-fields of ages past. And, nobler yet, she dares to know Her future's task, nor knows in vain; But strikes at once the generous blow That makes her millions men again! So, firmer-based, her power expands, Nor yet has seen its crowning hour,— Still teaching to the struggling lands That Peace the offspring is of Power. Build, then, the storied bronze, to tell The steps whereby this height she trod,— The thousand years that chronicle The toil of Man, the help of God! And may the thousand years to come,— The future ages, wise and free,— Still see her flag, and hear her drum Across the world, from sea to sea!— Still find, a symbol stern and grand, Her ancient eagle's wings unshorn: One head to watch the Western land, And one to guard the land of morn! Novgorod, Russia, 1862. THE NEVA I walk, as in a dream, Beside the sweeping stream, Wrapped in the summer midnight's amber haze: Serene the temples stand, And sleep, on either hand, The palace-fronts along the granite quays. Where golden domes, remote, Above the sea-mist float, The river-arms, dividing, hurry forth; And Peter's fortress-spire, A slender lance of fire, Still sparkles back the splendor of the North. The pillared angel soars Above the silent shores; Dark from his rock the horseman hangs in air; And down the watery line The exiled Sphinxes pine For Karnak's morning in the mellow glare. I hear, amid the hush, The restless current's rush, The Neva murmuring through his crystal zone: A voice portentous, deep, To charm a monarch's sleep With dreams of power resistless as his own. Strong from the stormy Lake, Pure from the springs that break In Valdaï vales the forest's mossy floor, Greener than beryl-stone From fir-woods vast and lone, In one full stream the braided currents pour. “Build up your granite piles Around my trembling isles,” I hear the River's scornful Genius say: “Raise for eternal time Your palaces sublime, And flash your golden turrets in the day! “But in my waters cold A mystery I hold,— Of empires and of dynasties the fate: I bend my haughty will, Unchanged, unconquered still, And smile to note your triumph: mine can wait. “Your fetters I allow, As a strong man may bow His sportive neck to meet a child's command, And curb the conscious power That in one awful hour Could whelm your halls and temples where they stand. “When infant Rurik first His Norseland mother nursed, My willing flood the future chieftain bore: To Alexander's fame I lent my ancient name, What time my waves ran red with Pagan gore. “Then Peter came. I laughed To feel his little craft Borne on my bosom round the marshy isles: His daring dream to aid, My chafing floods I laid, And saw my shores transfixed with arrowy piles. “I wait the far-off day When other dreams shall sway The House of Empire builded by my side,— Dreams that already soar From yonder palace-door, And cast their wavering colors on my tide,— “Dreams where white temples rise Below the purple skies, By waters blue, which winter never frets,— Where trees of dusky green From terraced gardens lean, And shoot on high the reedy minarets. “Shadows of mountain-peaks Vex my unshadowed creeks; Dark woods o'erhang my silvery birchen bowers; And islands, bald and high, Break my clear round of sky, And ghostly odors blow from distant flowers. “Then, ere the cold winds chase These visions from my face, I see the starry phantom of a crown, Beside whose blazing gold This cheating pomp is cold, A moment hover, as the veil drops down. “Build on! That day shall see My streams forever free. Swift as the wind, and silent as the snow, The frost shall split each wall: Your domes shall crack and fall: My bolts of ice shall strike your barriers low!” On palace, temple, spire, The morn's descending fire In thousand sparkles o'er the city fell: Life's rising murmur drowned The Neva where he wound Between his isles: he keeps his secret well. 1863. A STORY FOR A CHILD I Little one, come to my knee! Hark how the rain is pouring Over the roof, in the pitch-black night, And the wind in the woods a-roaring! II Hush, my darling, and listen, Then pay for the story with kisses: Father was lost in the pitch-black night, In just such a storm as this is! III High up on the lonely mountains, Where the wild men watched and waited; Wolves in the forest, and bears in the bush, And I on my path belated. IV The rain and the night together Came down, and the wind came after, Bending the props of the pine-tree roof And snapping many a rafter. V I crept along in the darkness, Stunned, and bruised, and blinded— Crept to a fir with thick-set boughs, And a sheltering rock behind it. VI There, from the blowing and raining Crouching, I sought to hide me: Something rustled, two green eyes shone, And a wolf lay down beside me. VII Little one, be not frightened; I and the wolf together, Side by side, through the long, long night, Hid from the awful weather. VIII His wet fur pressed against me; Each of us warmed the other: Each of us felt, in the stormy dark, That beast and man was brother. IX And when the falling forest No longer crashed in warning, Each of us went from our hiding-place Forth in the wild, wet morning. X Darling, kiss me payment! Hark how the wind is roaring: Father's house is a better place When the stormy rain is pouring! 1861 FROM THE NORTH Once more without you! Sighing, Dear, once more, For all the sweet, accustomed ministries Of wife and mother: not as when the seas That parted us my tender message bore From the gray olives of the Cretan shore To those that hide the broken Phidian frieze Of our Athenian home,—but far degrees, Wide plains, great forests, part us now. My door Looks on the rushing Neva, cold and clear: The swelling domes in hovering splendor lie Like golden bubbles, eager to be gone; But the chill crystal of the atmosphere Withholds them, and along the northern sky The amber midnight smiles in dreams of dawn. 1862. A WEDDING SONNET TO T. B. A. AND L. W. Sad Autumn, drop thy weedy crown forlorn, Put off thy cloak of cloud, thy scarf of mist, And dress in gauzy gold and amethyst A day benign, of sunniest influence born, As may befit a Poet's marriage morn! Give buds another dream, another tryst To loving hearts, and print on lips unkissed Betrothal-kisses, laughing Spring to scorn! Yet, if unfriendly thou, with sullen skies, Bleak rains, or moaning winds, dost menace wrong, Here art thou foiled: a bridal sun shall rise And bridal emblems unto these belong. Round her the sunshine of her beauty lies, And breathes round him the springtime of his song! 1865. CHRISTMAS SONNETS I TO G. H. B. If that my hand, like yours, dear George, were skilled To win from Wordsworth's scanty plot of ground A shining harvest, such as you have found, Where strength and grace, fraternally fulfilled, As in those sheaves whose rustling glories gild The hills of August, folded are, and bound; So would I draw my loving tillage round Its borders, bid the gentlest rains be spilled, The goldenest suns its happy growth compel, And bind for you the ripe, redundant grain: But, ah! you stand amid your songful sheaves, So rich, this weed-born flower you might disdain, Save that of me its growth and color tell, And of my love some perfume haunt its leaves! II TO R. H. S. The years go by, old Friend! Each, as it fleets, Moves to a farther, fairer realm, the time When first we twain the pleasant land of Rhyme Discovered, choosing side by side our seats Below our separate Gods: in midnight streets And haunted attics flattered by the chime Of silver words, and, fed by faith sublime, I Shelley's mantle wore, you that of Keats,— Dear dreams, that marked the Muse's childhood then, Nor now to be disowned! The years go by; The clear-eyed Goddess flatters us no more; And yet, I think, in soberer aims of men, And Song's severer service, you and I Are nearer, dearer, faithfuller than before. III TO E. C. S. When days were long, and o'er that farm of mine, Green Cedarcroft, the summer breezes blew, And from the walnut shadows I and you, Dear Edmund, saw the red lawn-roses shine, Or followed our idyllic Brandywine Through meadows flecked with many a flowery hue, To where with wild Arcadian pomp I drew Your Bacchic march among the startled kine, You gave me, linked with old Mæonides, Your loving sonnet,—record dear and true Of days as dear: and now, when suns are brief, And Christmas snows are on the naked trees, I give you this,—a withered winter leaf, Yet with your blossom from one root it grew. IV TO J. L. G. If I could touch with Petrarch's pen this strain Of graver song, and shape to liquid flow Of soft Italian syllables the glow That warms my heart, my tribute were not vain: But how shall I such measured sweetness gain As may your golden nature fitly show, And with the heart-light shine, that fills you so, It pales the graces of the cultured brain? Long have I known, Love better is than Fame, And Love hath crowned you: yet if any bay Cling to my chaplet when the years have fled, And I am dust, may this which bears your name Cling latest, that my love's result shall stay When that which mine ambition wrought is dead. A STATESMAN He knew the mask of principle to wear, And power accept while seeming to decline: So cunningly he wrought, with tools so fine, Setting his courses with so frank an air, (Yet most secure when seeming most to dare,) He did deceive us all: with mien benign His malice smiled, his cowardice the sign Of courage took, his selfishness grew fair, So deftly could his foiled ambition show A modest acquiescence. Now, 't is clear What man he is,—how false his high report; Mean to the friend, caressing to the foe; Plotting the mischief which he feigns to fear; Chief Eunuch, were but ours the Sultan's court! 1865. CHANT FOR THE BRYANT FESTIVAL November 5, 1864 One hour be silent, sounds of war! Delay the battle he foretold, And let the Bard's triumphant star Send down from heaven its milder gold! Let Fame, that plucks but laurel now For loyal heroes, turn away, And twine, to crown our poet's brow, The greener garland of the bay. For he, our earliest minstrel, fills The land with echoes, sweet and long, Gives language to her silent hills, And bids her rivers move to song. The Phosphor of the Nation's dawn. Sole risen above our tuneless coast, As Hesper now, his lamp burns on,— The leader of the starry host. He sings of mountains and of streams, Of storied field and haunted dale, Yet hears a voice through all his dreams, Which says: “The Good shall yet prevail.” He sings of Truth, he sings of Right; He sings of Freedom, and his strains March with our armies to the fight, Ring in the bondman's falling chains. God, bid him live, till in her place Truth, crushed to earth, again shall rise,— The “mother of a mighty race” Fulfil her poet's prophecies! MISCELLANEOUS POEMS 1861–1871 A DAY IN MARCH Look forth, Beloved, from thy mansion high, By soft airs fanned, And see the summer from her bluest sky Surprise the land! See how the bare hills bask in purple bliss Along the south: On the brown death of winter falls a kiss From summer's mouth! From pines that weave, among the ravished trees, Their phantom bowers, A murmur comes, as sought the ghosts of bees The ghosts of flowers. Though yet no blood may swell the willow rind, No grass-blade start, A dream of blossoms fills the yearning wind, Of love, my heart. Look forth, Beloved, through the tender air, And let thine eyes The violets be, it finds not anywhere, And scentless dies. Look, and thy trembling locks of plenteous gold The day shall see, And search no more where first, on yonder wold, The cowslips be. Look, and the wandering summer not forlorn Shall turn aside, Content to leave her million flowers unborn, Her songs untried. Drowsy with life and not with sleep or death I dream of thee: Breathe forth thy being in one answering breath, And come to me! Come forth, Beloved! Love's exultant sign Is in the sky: And let me lay my panting heart to thine And die! 1861. THE TEST “Farewell awhile, my bonnie darling! One long, close kiss, and I depart: I hear the angry trumpet snarling, The drum-beat tingles at my heart.” Behind him, softest flutes were breathing, Across the vale their sweet recall; Before him burst the battle, seething In flame beneath its thunder-pall. All sights and sounds to stay invited; The meadows tossed their foam of flowers; The lingering Day beheld, delighted, The dances of his amorous Hours. He paused: again the foul temptation Assailed his heart, so firm before, And tender dreams, of Love's creation, Persuaded from the peaceful shore. “But no!” he sternly cried; “I follow The trumpet, not the shepherd's reed. Let idlers pipe in pastoral hollow,— Be mine the sword, and mine the deed! “Farewell to Love!” he murmured, sighing: “Perchance I lose what most is dear: But better there, struck down and dying, Than be a man, and wanton here!” He went where battle's voice was loudest; He pressed where danger nearest came; His hand advanced, among the proudest, Their banner through the lines of flame. And there, when wearied Carnage faltered, He, foremost of the fallen, lay, While Night looked down with brow unaltered, And breathed the battle's dust away. There lying, sore from wounds untended, A vision crossed the starry gleam: The girl he loved beside him bended, And kissed him in his fever-dream. “O love!” she cried, “you fled, to find me; I left with you the daisied vale: I turned from flutes that wailed behind me, To hear your trumpet's distant hail. “Your tender vows, your peaceful kisses, They scarce outlived the moment's breath; But now we clasp immortal blisses Of Passion proved on brinks of Death! “No fate henceforward shall estrange her Who finds a heart more brave than fond; For Love, forsook this side of danger, Waits for the man who goes beyond!” 1862. CANOPUS A LEAF FROM THE PAST Above the palms, the peaks of pearly gray That hang, like dreams, along the slumbering skies, An urn of fire that never burns away, I see Canopus rise. An urn of light, a golden-hearted torch, Voluptuous, drowsy-throbbing mid the stars, As, incense-fed, from Aphrodite's porch Lifted, to beacon Mars. Is it from songs and stories of the Past, With names and scenes that make our planet fair,— From Babylonian splendors, vague and vast, And flushed Arabian air: Or sprung from richer longings of the brain And spices of the blood, this hot desire To lie beneath that mellow lamp again And breathe its languid fire? From tales of nights when watching David saw Its amorous ray on bright Bathsheba's head; Or Charmian stole, the golden gauze to draw Round Cleopatra's bed? Or when white-breasted Paris touched the lone Laconian isle, where stayed his flying oars, And Helen breathed the scent of violets, blown Along the bosky shores? Or Kalidasa's maiden, wandering through The moonlit jungles of the Indian lands, While shamed mimosas from her form withdrew Their thin and trembling hands? For Fancy takes from Passion power to build A brighter fane than bloodless Thought decrees, And loves to see its spacious chambers filled With tropic tapestries. And, past those halls which for itself the mind Builds, permanent as marble, and as cold, In warm surprises of the blood we find The sumptuous dream unfold! There shines the leaf and bursts the blossom sheath On hills deep-mantled in eternal June, Or wave their whispering silver, underneath The rainbow-cinctured moon. Around the pillars of the palm-tree bower The orchids cling, in rose and purple spheres; Shield-broad the lily floats; the aloe flower Foredates its hundred years. Along the lines of coral, white and warm, Breaks the white surf; hushed is the glassy air, And only mellower murmurs tell that storm Is raging otherwhere. The mansion gleams with dome and arch Moresque— Ah, bliss to lie beside the jasper urn Of founts, and through the open arabesque To watch Canopus burn! To sit at feasts, and fluid odors drain Of daintiest nectar that from grape is caught, While faint narcotics cheat the idle brain With phantom shapes of thought; Or, listening to the sweet, seductive voice, No will hath silenced, since the world began, To weigh delight unchallenged, making choice Of earlier joys of man! Permit the dream: our natures twofold are. Sense hath its own ideals, which prepare A rosy background for the soul's white star, Whereon it shines more fair. Not crystal runs, dissolved from mountain snow, The poet's blood; but amber, musk, impart Their scents, and gems their orbed or shivered glow, To feed his tropic heart. While Form and Color undivorced remain In every planet gilded by the sun, His craft shall forge the radiant marriage-chain That makes them purely One! 1865. CUPIDO THE REVIVAL OF AN ANTIQUATED FIGURE, AFTER READING THE VIEWS OF CERTAIN WOMEN ON MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE I Roseate darling, Dimpled with laughter, Nursed on the bosom Pierced by thee after; Fed with the rarest Milk of the fairest Fond Aphrodite, Child as thou art, as a god thou art mighty! II Thou art the only Demigod left us; Fate hath bereft us, Science made lonely. Visions and fables Shrink from our portals; Long have we banished The stately Immortals; Yet, when we sent them Trooping to Hades— Olympian gentlemen, Paphian ladies— Thou hadst re-risen, Ere the dark prison Closed for the last time, Slipped from the gate and returned to thy pastime! III Ever a mystery, All of our history Brightens with thee! Systems have chained us, Rulers restrained us, Fortune disdained us, Still thou wert free! Lofty or lowly, Brutish or holy, Spacious or narrow, Never a life was secure from thy arrow! IV Ah, but they 've told us Love is a system! They would withhold us When we have kissed him! All that perplexes Sweetly the sexes They would control, And with Affinity Drive the Divinity Out of the soul! Better, they say, is Phryne or Laïs Than the immutable Faith, and its suitable Vow, he hath taught us; Foolish the tender Pang, the surrender, When he has caught us; Fancies and fetters are all he has brought us. V Future parental, Physical, mental Laws they prescribe us; And with ecstatic Strict mathematic Blisses would bribe us. Alkali, acid, They with a placid Mien would unite, And the wild rapture Of chasing and capture Curb with a right; Measuring, dealing Even the kiss of the twilight of feeling! VI Who shall deliver Thee from their credo? Rent is thy quiver, Darling Cupido! Naked, yet blameless, Tricksily aimless, Secretly sure, Who, then, thy plighting, Wilful uniting, Now will endure? Now, when experiment Based upon Science Sets at defiance, Harshly, thy merriment, Who shall caress thee Warm in his bosom, and bliss thee and bless thee? VII Ever 't is May-time! Ever 't is play-time Of Beauty and Youth! Freed from confusion, Hides in illusion Nature her truth. Books and discourses, What can they tell us? Blood with its forces Still will compel us! Cold ones may fly to Systems, or try to; Innocent fancy Still will enwind us, Love's necromancy Snare us and bind us, Systems and rights lie forgotten behind us. 1870. THE SLEEPER The glen was fair as some Arcadian dell, All shadow, coolness, and the rush of streams, Save where the sprinkled blaze of noonday fell Like stars within its under-sky of dreams. Rich leaf and blossomed grape and fern-tuft made Odors of life and slumber through the shade. “O peaceful heart of Nature!” was my sigh; “How dost thou shame, in thine unconscious bliss, Thy sure accordance with the changing sky, O quiet heart, the restless beat of this! Take thou the place false friends have vacant left, And bring thy bounty to repair the theft!” So sighing, weary with the unsoothed pain From insect-stings of women and of men, Uneasy heart and ever-baffled brain, I breathed the lonely beauty of the glen, And from the fragrant shadows where she stood Evoked the shyest Dryad of the wood. Lo! on a slanting rock, outstretched at length, A woodman lay in slumber, fair as death, His limbs relaxed in all their supple strength, His lips half parted with his easy breath, And by one gleam of hovering light caressed His bare brown arm and white uncovered breast. “Why comes he here?” I whispered, treading soft The hushing moss beside his flinty bed; “Sweet are the haycocks in yon clover-croft,— The meadow turf were light beneath his head: Could he not slumber by the orchard-tree, And leave this quiet unprofaned for me?” But something held my step. I bent, and scanned (As one might view a veiny agate-stone) The hard, half-open fingers of his hand, Strong cords of wrist, knit round the jointed bone, And sunburnt muscles, firm and full of power, But harmless now as petals of a flower. There lay the unconscious Life, but, ah! more fair Than ever blindly stirred in leaf and bark,— Warmth, beauty, passion, mystery everywhere, Beyond the Dryad's feebly burning spark Of cold poetic being: who could say If here the angel or the wild beast lay? Then I looked up, and read his helpless face: Peace touched the temples and the eyelids, slept On drooping lashes, made itself a place In smiles that slowly to the corners crept Of parting lips, and came and went, to show The happy freedom of the heart below. A holy rest! wherein the man became Man's interceding representative: In Sleep's white realm fell off his mask of blame, And he was sacred, for that he did live. His presence marred no more the quiet deep, But all the glen became a shrine of Sleep! And then I mused: how lovely this repose! How the shut sense its dwelling consecrates! Sleep guards itself against the hands of foes; Its breath disarms the Envies and the Hates Which haunt our lives: were this mine enemy, My stealthy watch could not less reverent be! So hang their hands, that would have done me wrong; So sweet their breathing, whose unkindly spite Provoked the bitter measures of my song; So might they slumber, sacred in my sight, Or I in theirs:—why waste contentious breath? Forget, like Sleep; and then forgive, like Death! 1865. MY FARM: A FABLE Within a green and pleasant land I own a favorite plantation, Whose woods and meads, if rudely planned, Are still, at least, my own creation. Some genial sun or kindly shower Has here and there wooed forth a flower, And touched the fields with expectation. I know what feeds the soil I till, What harvest-growth it best produces: My forests shape themselves at will, My grapes mature their proper juices. I know the brambles and the weeds, But know the fruits and wholesome seeds,— Of those the hurt, of these the uses. And working early, working late, Directing crude and random Nature, 'T is joy to see my small estate Grow fairer in the slightest feature. If but a single wild-rose blow, Or fruit-tree bend with April snow, That day am I the happiest creature! But round the borders of the land Dwell many neighbors, fond of roving; With curious eye and prying hand About my fields I see them moving. Some tread my choicest herbage down, And some of weeds would weave a crown, And bid me wear it, unreproving. “What trees!” says one; “who ever saw A grove, like this, of my possessing? This vale offends my upland's law; This sheltered garden needs suppressing. My rocks this grass would never yield, And how absurd the level field! What here will grow is past my guessing.” “Behold the slope!” another cries: “No sign of bog or meadow near it! A varied surface I despise: There's not a stagnant pool to cheer it!” “Why plough at all?” remarked a third. “Heaven help the man!” a fourth I heard,— “His farm 's a jungle: let him clear it!” No friendly counsel I disdain: My fields are free to every comer; Yet that which one to praise is fain But makes another's visage glummer. I bow them out, and welcome in, But while I seek some truth to win, Goes by, unused, the golden summer! Ah! vain the hope to find in each The wisdom each denies the other; These mazes of conflicting speech All theories of culture smother. I'll raise and reap, with honest hand, The native harvest of my land; Do thou the same, my wiser brother! 1866. HARPOCRATES “The rest is silence.”— Hamlet. I The message of the god I seek In voice, in vision, or in dream, Alike on frosty Dorian peak, Or by the slow Arcadian stream: Where'er the oracle is heard, I bow the head and bend the knee; In dream, in vision, or in word, The sacred secret reaches me. II Athwart the dim Trophonian caves, Bat-like, the gloomy whisper flew; The lisping plash of Paphian waves Bathed every pulse in fiery dew: From Phœbus, on his cloven hill. A shaft of beauty pierced the air, And oaks of gray Dodona still Betrayed the Thunderer's presence there. III The warmth of love, the grace of art, The joys that breath and blood express, The desperate forays of the heart Into an unknown wilderness,— All these I know: but sterner needs Demand the knowledge which must dower The life that on achievement feeds, The grand activity of power. IV What each reveals the shadow throws Of something unrevealed behind; The Secret's lips forever close To mock the secret undivined: Thence late I came, from weary dreams The son of Isis to implore, Whose temple-front of granite gleams Across the Desert's yellow floor. V Lo! where the sand, insatiate, drinks The steady splendor of the air, Crouched on her heavy paws, the Sphinx Looks forth with old, unwearied stare! Behind her, on the burning wall, The long processions flash and glow: The pillared shadows of the hall Sleep with their lotus-crowns below. VI A square of dark beyond, the door Breathes out the deep adytum's gloom: I cross the court's deserted floor, And stand within the sacred room. The priests repose from finished rite; No echo rings from pavements trod; And sits alone, in swarthy light, The naked child, the temple's god. VII No sceptre, orb, or mystic toy Proclaims his godship, young and warm He sits alone, a naked boy, Clad in the beauty of his form. Dark, solemn stars, of radiance mild, His eyes illume the golden shade, And sweetest lips that never smiled The finger hushes, on them laid. VIII O, never yet in trance or dream That falls when crowned desire has died, So breathed the air of power supreme. So breathed, and calmed, and satisfied! Those mystic lips were not unsealed The temple's awful hush to break, But unto inmost sense revealed, The deity his message spake: IX “If me thou knowest, stretch thy hand And my possessions thou shalt reach: I grant no help, I break no band, I sit above the gods that teach. The latest-born, my realm includes The old, the strong, the near, the far,— Serene beyond their changeful moods, And fixed as Night's unmoving star. X “A child, I leave the dance of Earth To be my hornèd mother's care: My father Ammon's Bacchic mirth, Delighting gods, I may not share. I turn from Beauty, Love, and Power, In singing vale, on laughing sea; From Youth and Hope, and wait the hour When weary Knowledge turns to me. XI “Beneath my hand the sacred springs Of Man's mysterious being burst, And Death within my shadow brings The last of life, to greet the first. There is no god, or grand or fail, On Orcan or Olympian field, But must to me his treasures bear, His one peculiar secret yield. XII “I wear no garment, drop no shade Before the eyes that all things see; My worshippers, howe'er arrayed, Come in their nakedness to me. The forms of life like gilded towers May soar, in air and sunshine drest,— The home of Passions and of Powers,— Yet mine the crypts whereon they rest. XIII “Embracing all, sustaining all, Consoling with unuttered lore, Who finds me in my voiceless hall Shall need the oracles no more. I am the knowledge that insures Peace, after Thought's bewildering range; I am the patience that endures; I am the truth that cannot change!” 1865. RUN WILD Here was the gate. The broken paling, As if before the wind, inclines. The posts half rotted, and the pickets failing, Held only up by vines. The plum-trees stand, though gnarled and speckled With leprosy of old disease; By cells of wormy life the trunks are freckled, And moss enfolds their knees. I push aside the boughs and enter: Alas! the garden's nymph has fled, With every charm that leaf and blossom lent her, And left a hag instead. Some female satyr from the thicket, Child of the bramble and the weed, Sprang shouting over the unguarded wicket With all her savage breed. She banished hence the ordered graces That smoothed a way for Beauty's feet, And gave her ugliest imps the vacant places, To spoil what once was sweet. Here, under rankling mulleins, dwindle The borders, hidden long ago; Here shoots the dock in many a rusty spindle, And purslane creeps below. The thyme runs wild, and vainly sweetens, Hid from its bees, the conquering grass; And even the rose with briery menace threatens To tear me as I pass. Where show the weeds a grayer color, The stalks of lavender and rue Stretch like imploring arms,—but, ever duller, They slowly perish too. Only the pear-tree's fruitless scion Exults above the garden's fall: Only the thick-maned ivy, like a lion, Devours the crumbling wall. What still survives becomes as savage As that which entered to destroy, Taking an air of riot and of ravage, Of strange and wanton joy. No copse unpruned, no mountain hollow, So lawless in its growth may be: Where the wild weeds have room to chase and follow, They graceful are, and free. But Nature here attempts revenges For her obedience unto toil; She brings her rankest life with loathsome changes To smite the fattened soil. For herbs of sweet and wholesome savor She plants her stems of bitter juice; From flowers she steals the scent, from fruits the flavor, From homelier things the use. Her angel is a mocking devil, If once the law relax its bands; In Man's neglected fields she holds her revel, Takes back, and spoils his lands. Once having broken ground, he never The virgin sod can plant again: The soil demands his services forever,— And God gives sun and rain! 1868. SONNET Where should the Poet's home and household be? Beneath what skies, in what untroubled air Sings he for very joy of songs so fair That in their steadfast laws he most is free? In woods remote, where darkly tree on tree Let fall their curtained shadows, to ensnare His dreams, or hid in Fancy's happiest lair,— Some laughing island of the stormless sea? Ah, never such to him their welcome gave! But, flattered by the gods in finer scorn, He drifts upon the world's unresting wave, As drifts a sea-flower, by the tempest torn From sheltered porches of the coral cave Where it expands, of calm and silence born. 1866. “CASA GUIDI WINDOWS” Returned to warm existence,—even as one Sentenced, then blotted from the headsman's book, Accepts with doubt the life again begun,— I leave the duress of my couch, and look Through Casa Guidi windows to the sun. A fate like Farinata's held me fast In some devouring pit of fever-fire, Until, from ceaseless forms of toil that cast Their will upon me, whirled in endless gyre, The Spirit of the House brought help at last. With Giotto wrestling, through the desperate hours A thousand crowded frescos must I paint, Or snatch from twilights dim, and dusky bowers, Alternate forms of bacchanal and saint, The streets of Florence and her beauteous towers. Weak, wasted with those torments of the brain, The circles of the Tuscan master's hell Were dreams no more; but when their fiery strain Was fiercest, deep and sudden stillness fell Athwart the storm, and all was peace again. She came, whom Casa Guidi's chambers knew, And know more proudly, an Immortal, now; The air without a star was shivered through With the resistless radiance of her brow, And glimmering landscapes from the darkness grew. Thin, phantom-like; and yet she brought me rest. Unspoken words, an understood command Sealed weary lids with sleep, together pressed In clasping quiet wandering hand to hand, And smoothed the folded cloth above the breast. Now, looking through these windows, where the day Shines on a terrace splendid with the gold Of autumn shrubs, and green with glossy bay, Once more her face, re-made from dust, I hold In light so clear it cannot pass away:— The quiet brow; the face so frail and fair For such a voice of song; the steady eye, Where shone the spirit fated to outwear Its fragile house;—and on her features lie The soft half-shadows of her drooping hair. Who could forget those features, having known? Whose memory do his kindling reverence wrong That heard the soft Ionian flute, whose tone Changed with the silver trumpet of her song? No sweeter airs from woman's lips were blown. Ah, in the silence she has left behind How many a sorrowing voice of life is still! Songless she left the land that cannot find Song for its heroes; and the Roman hill, Once free, shall for her ghost the laurel wind. The tablet tells you, “Here she wrote and died,” And grateful Florence bids the record stand: Here bend Italian love and English pride Above her grave,—and one remoter land, Free as her prayers would make it, at their side. I will not doubt the vision: yonder see The moving clouds that speak of freedom won! And life, new-lighted, with a lark-like glee Through Casa Guidi windows hails the sun, Grown from the rest her spirit gave to me. Florence, 1867. PANDORA Italy, loved of the sun, Wooed of the sweet winds and wed by the sea, When, since the nations begun, Was other inheritance like unto thee? Splendors of sunshine and snows Flash from thy peaks to thy bath in the brine; Thine are the daisy and rose, The grace of the palm and the strength of the pine: Orchard and harvested plain; Lakes, by the touch of the tempest unstirred; Dells where the Dryads remain, And mountains that rise to a music unheard? Generous gods, at thy birth, Heaped on thy cradle with prodigal hand Gifts, and the darling of earth Art thou, and wast ever, O ravishing land! Strength from the Thunderer came, Pride from the goddess that governs his board; While, in his forges of flame, Hephæstus attempered thine armor and sword. Lo! Aphrodite her zone, Winning all love to thy loveliness, gave; Leaving her Paphian throne To breathe on thy mountains and brighten thy wave. Bacchus the urns of his wine Gave, and the festivals crowning thy toil; Ceres, the mother divine, Bestowed on thee bounties of corn and of oil. Phœbus the songs that inspire, Caught from the airs of Olympus, conferred: Hermes, the sweetness and fire That pierce in the charm of the eloquent word. So were thy graces complete; Yea, and, though ruined, they fascinate now: Beautiful still are thy feet, And girt with the gold of lost lordship thy brow. 1868. SORRENTO I The gods are gone, the temples overthrown, The storms of time the very rocks have shaken: The Past is mute, save where some mouldy stone Speaks to confuse, like speech by age o'ertaken. The pomp that crowned the winding shore Has fled for evermore: Its old magnificence shall never reawaken. II Where once, against the Grecian ships arrayed, The Oscan warriors saw their javelins hurtle, The farmer prunes his olives, and the maid Trips down the lanes in flashing vest and kirtle: The everlasting laurel now Forgets Apollo's brow, And, dedicate no more to Venus, blooms the myrtle. III Yet still, as long ago, when this high coast Phœnician strangers saw, and flying Dardans, The bounteous earth fulfils her ancient boast In mellow fields which Winter never hardens; And daisy, lavender, and rose Perpetual buds unclose, To flood with endless balm the tiers of hanging gardens. IV From immemorial rocks the daffodil Beckons with scented stars, an unreached wonder: On sunny banks their wine the hyacinths spill, And self-betraying violets bloom thereunder; While near and threatening, dim and deep, The wave assails the steep, Or booms in hollow caves with sound of smothered thunder. V Here Nature, dropping once her ordered plan, Fashioned all lovely things that most might please her— A play ground guarded from the greed of man, The childish gauds, wherewith he would appease her: Her sweetest air, her softest wave Reluctantly she gave To grace the wealth of Rome, to heal the languid Cæsar. VI She stationed there Vesuvius, to be Contrasted horror to her idyl tender: Across the azure pavement of the sea She raised a cape of Baïæs marble splendor; And westward, on the circling zone, To front the seas unknown, She planted Capri's couchant lion to defend her. VII A mother kind, she doth but tantalize: Nor from her secret gardens will she spurn us. The Roman, casting hitherward his eyes, Forgot his Sybaris beside Volturnus— Forgot the streams and sylvan charms That decked his Sabine farms, And orchards on the slopes that sink to still Avernus. VIII Here was his substance wasted; here he lost The marrow that subdued the world, in leisure; Counting no days that were not feasts, no cost Too dear to purchase finer forms of pleasure; Yet, while for him stood still the sun, The restless world rolled on, And shook from off its skirts Cæsar and Cæsar's treasure. IX Less than he sought will we: a moon of peace, To feed the mind on Fancy's airy diet; Soft airs that come like memories of Greece, Nights that renew the old Phœnician quiet: Escape from yonder burning crest That stirs with new unrest, And in its lava-streams keeps hot the endless riot. X Here, from the wars of Gaul, the strife of Rome, May we, meek citizens, a summer screen us: Here find with milder Earth a perfect home, Once, ere she puts profounder rest between us: Here break the sacred laurel bough Still for Apollo's brow, And bind the myrtle buds to crown a purer Venus. 1868. IN MY VINEYARD I At last the dream that clad the field Is fairest fact, and stable; At last my vines a covert yield, A patch for song and fable. I thread the rustling ranks, that hide Their misty violet treasure, And part the sprays with more than pride, And more than owner's pleasure. II The tender shoots, the fragrance fine, Betray the garden's poet, Whose daintiest life is turned to wine, Yet half is shy to show it,— The epicure, who yields to toil A scarce fulfilled reliance, But takes from sun and dew and soil A grace unguessed by science. III Faint odors, from the bunches blown, Surround me and subdue me; The vineyard-breath of many a zone Is softly breathing through me: From slopes of Eshkol, in the sun, And many a hillside classic: From where Falernian juices run, And where they press the Massic! IV Where airy terraces, on high, The hungry vats replenish, And, less from earth than from the sky, Distil the golden Rhenish: Where, light of heart, the Bordelais Compels his stony level To burst and foam in purple spray,— The rose that crowns the revel! V So here, as there, the subject earth Shall take a tenderer duty; And Labor walk with harmless Mirth, And wed with loving Beauty: So here, a gracious life shall fix Its seat, in sunnier weather; For sap and blood so sweetly mix, And richly run together! VI The vine was exiled from the land That bore but needful burdens; But now we slack the weary hand, And look for gentler guerdons: We take from Ease a grace above The strength we took from Labor, And win to laugh, and woo to love, Each grimly-earnest neighbor. VII What idle dreams! Even as I muse, I feel a falling shadow; And vapors blur and clouds confuse My coming Eldorado. Portentous, grim, a ghost draws nigh, To clip my flying fancy, And change the shows of earth and sky With evil necromancy. VIII The leaves on every vine-branch curl As if a frost had stung them; The bunches shrivel, snap, and whirl As if a tempest flung them; And as the ghost his forehead shakes, Denying and commanding, But withered stalks and barren stakes Surround me where I'm standing. IX “Beware!” the spectre cried, “the woe Of this delusive culture! The nightingale that lures thee so Shall hatch a ravening vulture. To feed the vat, to fill the bin, Thou pluck'st the vineyard's foison, That drugs the cup of mirth with sin, The veins of health with poison!” X But now a golden mist was born, With violet odors mingled: I felt a brightness, as of morn, And all my pulses tingled: And forms arose,—among them first The old Ionian lion, And they, Sicilian Muses nursed,— Theocritus and Bion. XI And he of Teos, he of Rome, The Sabine bard and urban; And Saadi, from his Persian home, And Hafiz in his turban: And Shakespeare, silent, sweet, and grave, And Herrick with his lawns on; And Luther, mellow, burly, brave, Along with Rare Ben Jonson! XII “Be comforted!” they seemed to say; “For Nature does no treasons: She neither gives nor takes away Without eternal reasons. She heaps the stores of corn and oil In such a liberal measure, That, past the utmost need of Toil, There's something left for Pleasure. XIII “The secret soul of sun and dew Not vainly she distilleth, And from these globes of pink and blue A harmless cup she filleth: Who loveth her may take delight In what for him she dresses, Nor find in cheerful appetite The portal to excesses. XIV “Yes, ever since the race began To press the vineyard's juices, It was the brute within the man Defiled their nobler uses; But they who take from order joy, And make denial duty, Provoke the brute they should destroy By Freedom and by Beauty!” XV They spake; and lo! the baleful shape Grew dim, and then retreated; And bending o'er the hoarded grape, The vines my vision greeted. The sunshine burst, the breezes turned The leaves till they were hoary, And over all the vineyard burned A fresher light of glory! 1869. THE TWO GREETINGS I—Salve! Scarce from the void of shadows taken, We hail thine opening eyelids, boy! Be welcome to the world! Awaken To strength and beauty, and to joy! Within those orbs of empty wonder Let life its starry fires increase, And curve those tender lips asunder With faintest smiles of baby peace. Sealed in their buds, the beauteous senses Shall gladden thee as they unfold: With soft allurements, stern defences, Thy riper being they shall mould. Far-eyed desires and hopes unbounded Within thy narrow nest are furled: Behold, for thee how fair is rounded The circle of the sunlit world! The oceans and the winds invite thee, The peopled lands thy coming wait: No wreck nor storm shall long affright thee, For all are parts of thine estate. Advance to every triumph wrested By plough and pencil, pen and sword, For, with thy robes of action vested, Though slaves be others, thou art lord! Thy breath be love, thy growth be duty, To end in peace as they began: Pre-human in thy helpless beauty, Become more beautiful, as Man! II.—Vale! Now fold thy rich experience round thee, To shield therewith the sinking heart: The sunset-gold of Day hath crowned thee: The dark gate opens,—so depart! What growth the leafy years could render No more into its bud returns; It clothes thee still with faded splendor As banks are clothed by autumn ferns. All spring could dream or summer fashion, If ripened, or untimely cast, The harvest of thy toil and passion— Thy sheaf of life—is bound at last. What scattered ears thy field encloses, What tares unweeded, now behold; And here the poppies, there the roses, Send withered fragrance through the gold. Lo! as thou camest, so thou goest, From bright Unknown to bright Unknown, Save that the light thou forward throwest, Was fainter then behind thee thrown. Again be glad! through tears and laughter, And deed and failure, thou art strong: Thy Here presages thy Hereafter, And neither sphere shall do thee wrong! To mother-breasts of nurture fonder Go, child!—once more in beauty young: And hear our Vale! echoed yonder As Salve! in a sweeter tongue! 1869. SHEKH AHNAF'S LETTER FROM BAGHDAD In Allah's name, the Ever Merciful, The Most Compassionate! To thee, my friend, Ben-Arif, peace and blessing! May this scroll, A favored herald, tell thee in Tangier That Ahnaf follows soon, if Allah wills! Yes, after that last day at Arafât Whereof I wrote thee,—after weary moons, Delayed among the treacherous Wahabees,— The long, sweet rest beneath Derreyeh's palms, That cooled my body for the burning bath Of naked valleys in the hither waste Beside Euphrates,—now behold me here In Baghdad! Here, and drinking from the well Whose first pure waters fertilized the West! I, as thou knowest, with both my hands took hold Of Law and of Tradition, so to lift To knowledge and obedience my soul. Severe was I accounted—but my strength Was likewise known of all men; and I craved The sterner discipline which Islam first Endured, and knit the sinews of our race. What says the Law?—“Who changes or perverts, Conceals, rejects, or holds of small account, Though it were but the slightest seeming word, Hath all concealed, perverted, slighted!” This, Thou knowest, I held, and hold. Here, I hoped, The rigid test should gladden limbs prepared To bend, accept, and then triumphant rise. Even as the weak of faith rejoice to find Some lax interpretation, I rejoiced In foretaste of the sure severity. As near I drew, across the sandy flats, Above the palms the yellow minaret Wrote on the sky my welcome: “Ahnaf, hail! Here, in the city of the Abbasid, Set thou thine evening by its morning star Of Faith, and bind the equal East and West!” Ah me, Ben-Arif! how shall pen of mine Set forth the perturbation of the soul? To doubt were death; not hope, were much the same As not believe—but Allah tries my strength With tests far other than severest law. When I had bathed, and then had cleansed with prayer My worn and dusty soul, (so, doubly pure, Pronounced the fathah as 't is heard in Heaven), I sought the court-yard of Almansour's mosque, Where, after asser, creeping shadows cool The marble, and the shekhs in commerce grave Keep fresh the ancient wisdom. Me they gave Reception kindly, though perchance I felt— Or fancied, only—lack of special warmth For vows accomplished and my pilgrim zeal. “Where is Tangier?” said one; whereat the rest With most indifferent knowledge did discuss The problem—none, had they but questioned me!— Then snatched again the theme they half let drop, And in their heat forgot me. I, abashed, Sat listening: vainly did I prick mine ears. I knew the words, indeed, but missed therein The wonted sense: they stripped our Holy Book Of every verse which not contains the Law,— Spake Justice and Forgiveness, Peace and Love, Nor once the duties of the right hand fixed, Nor service of the left: the nature they Of Allah glorified, and not His names: Of customs and observances no word Their lips let fall: and I distinguished not, Save by their turbans, that they other were Than Jews, or Christians, or the Pagans damned. Methought I dreamed; and in my mind withdrawn At last heard only the commingling clash Of voices near me, and the songs outside Of boatmen on the Tigris. Then a hand Came on my shoulder, and the oldest shekh, White-bearded Hatem, spake: “O Ahnaf! thou Art here a stranger, and it scarce beseems That we should speak of weighty matters thus To uninstructed ears—the less, to thine, Which, filled so long with idle sand, require The fresh delight of sympathetic speech That cools like yonder fountain, and makes glad. Nor wouldst thou hear, perchance, nor could we give An easy phrase as key to what so long Hath here been forged: but come to-night with me Where this shall be applied, and more, to bring Islam a better triumph than the sword Of Ali gave; for that but slew the foe, This maketh him a friend.” I, glad at heart To know my hope not false, yet wondering much, Gave eager promise, and at nightfall went With Hatem to the college of a sect We know not in the West—nor is there need: An ancient hall beneath a vaulted dome, With hanging lamps well lit, and cushioned seats Where sat a grave and motley multitude. When they beheld my guide, they all arose, And “Peace be with thee, Hatem!” greeting, cried. He, whispering to me: “O Ahnaf, sit And hear, be patient, wonder if thou wilt, But keep thy questions sagely to the end, When I shall seek thee”—to a dais passed, And sat him down. And all were silent there In decent order, or in whispers spoke; But great my marvel was when I beheld Parsee and Jew and Christian—yea, the race Of Boodh and Brahma—with the Faithful mixed As if 't were no defilement! Lo! they rose Again, with equal honor to salute The Rabbi Daood, Jewest of the Jews,— And even so, for an Armenian priest! Yet both some elder prophets share with us, And it might pass: but twice again they rose,— Once for a Parsee, tinged like smoky milk, His hat a leaning tower,—and once, a dark, Grave man, with turban thinner than a wheel, A wafer on his forehead (Satan's sign!)— A worshipper of Ganges and the cow! These made my knees to smite: yet Hatem stood And gave his hand, and they beside him sat. Then one by one made speech; and what the first, The shrill-tongued Rabbi, claimed as rule for all, That they accepted. “Forasmuch,” (said he) “As either of our sects hath special lore Which not concerns the others—special signs And marvels which the others must reject, However holy and attested deemed, Set we all such aside, and hold our minds Alone to that which in our creeds hath power To move, enlighten, strengthen, purify,— The God behind the veil of miracles! So speak we to the common brain of each And to the common heart; for what of Truth Grows one with life, is manifest to all, Or Jew, or Moslem, or whatever name, And none deny it: test we then how much This creed or that hath power to shape true lives.” All there these words applauded: Hatem most, Who spake: “My acquiescence lies therein, That on thy truth, O Jew! I build the claim Of him, our Prophet, to authority.” Then some one near me, jeering, said: “Well done! He gives up Gabriel and the Beast Boràk!” “Yea, but”—another answered—“must the Jew Not also lose his Pharaohs and his plagues, His rams'-horns and his Joshua and the sun?” “For once the Christians,” whispered back a Jew, “Must cease to turn their water into wine, Or feed the multitude with five small loaves And two small fishes.” Thus the people talked; While I, as one that in a dream appears To eat the flesh of swine, and cannot help The loathsome dream, awaited what should come. To me it seemed—and doubtless to the rest, Though heretics and pagans—as the chiefs Who there disputed were both maimed and bound, So little dared they offer, shorn and lopped Of all their vigor, false as well as true. Was it of Islam that Shekh Hatem spake, With ringing tongue and fiery words that forced Unwilling tears from Pagan and from Jew, And cries of “Allah Akhbar!” from his own? Forsooth, I know not: he was Islam's chief. How dared he nod his head and smile, to hear The Jew declare his faith in God the Lord, The Christian preach of love and sacrifice, The Parsee and the Hindoo recognize The gifts of charity and temperance, And peace and purity? If this be so, And heretic and pagan crowd with us The gates of Allah's perfect Paradise, Why hath He sent His Prophet? Nay,—I write In anger, not in doubt: nor need I here To thee, Ben-Arif, faithful man and wise, Portray the features of my shame and grief. Ere all had fully spoken, I, confused,— Hearing no word of washing or of prayer, Of cross, or ark, or fire, or symbol else Idolatrous, obscene,—could only guess What creed was glorified before the crowd, By garb and accent of the chief who spake: And scarcely then; for oft, as one set forth His holiest duties, all, as with one voice, Exclaimed: “But also these are mine!” The strife Was then, how potent were they, how observed,— Made manifest in life? One cannot say That such are needless, but their sacred stamp Comes from observance of all forms of law, Which here—the strength of Islam—was suppressed. Their wrangling—scarcely could it so be called!— Was o'er the husks: the kernel of the creed They first picked out, and flung it to the winds. I, pierced on every side with sorest stings, Waited uneasily the end delayed, When Hatem spake once more: his eye was bright, And the long beard that o'er his girdle rolled Shook as in storm. “Now, God be praised!” he cried: “God ever merciful, compassionate, Hath many children; these have many tongues: But of one blood are they, one truth they seek, One law of Love and Justice fits them all. And they have many Prophets: may it be, Though not of like commission, in so far As they declare His truth, they speak for Him! Go past their histories: accept their souls, And whatsoe'er of perfect and of pure Is breathed from each, in each and all the same, Confirms the others' office and its own! Here is the centre of the moving wheel,— The point of rest, wherefrom the separate creeds Build out their spokes, that seem to chase and flee, Revolving in the marches of His Day! If one be weak, destroy it: if it bear Unstrained His glory of Eternal Truth, And firmer fibre from the ages gain, Behold, at last it shall replace the rest! Even as He wills! The bright solution grows Nearer and clearer with the whirling years: Till finally the use of outward signs Shall be outworn, the crumbling walls thrown down, And one Religion shall make glad the world!” More I could not endure: I did not wait For Hatem's coming, as he promised me; Yet—ere amid the crowds I could escape— I saw the Rabbi and the Christian priest Fall on his neck with weeping. With a groan, A horrid sense of smothering in my throat, And words I will not write, I gained the air, And saw, O Prophet! how thy Crescent shone Above the feathery palm-tops, and the dome Of Haroun's tomb upon the Tigris' bank. And this is Baghdad!—Eblis, rather say!— O fallen city of the Abbasid, Where Islam is defiled, and by its sons! Prepare, Ben-Arif, to receive thy friend, Who with the coming moon shall westward turn To keep his faith undarkened in Tan gier! 1869. NAPOLEON AT GOTHA I We walk amid the currents of actions left undone, The germs of deeds that wither, before they see the sun. For every sentence uttered, a million more are dumb: Men's lives are chains of chances, and History their sum. II Not he, the Syracusan, but each impurpled lord Must eat his banquet under the hair-suspended sword; And one swift breath of silence may fix or change the fate Of him whose force is building the fabric of a state. III Where o'er the windy uplands the slated turrets shine, Duke August ruled at Gotha, in Castle Friedenstein,— A handsome prince and courtly, of light and shallow heart, No better than he should be, but with a taste for Art. IV The fight was fought at Jena, eclipsed was Prussia's sun, And by the French invaders the land was overrun; But while the German people were silent in despair, Duke August painted pictures, and curled his yellow hair. V Now, when at Erfurt gathered the ruling royal clan, Themselves the humble subjects, their lord the Corsican, Each bade to ball and banquet the sparer of his line: Duke August with the others, to Castle Friedenstein. VI Then were the larders rummaged, the forest-stags were slain, The tuns of oldest vintage showered out their golden rain; The towers were bright with banners,—but all the people said: “We, slaves, must feed our master,—would God that he were dead!” VII They drilled the ducal guardsmen, men young and straight and tall, To form a double column, from gate to castle-wall; And as there were but fifty, the first must wheel away, Fall in beyond the others, and lengthen the array. VIII “Parbleu!” Napoleon muttered: “Your Highness' guards I prize, So young and strong and handsome, and all of equal size.” “You, Sire,” replied Duke August, “may have as fine, if you Will twice or thrice repeat them, as I am forced to do!” IX Now, in the Castle household, of all the folk, was one Whose heart was hot within him, the Ducal Huntsman's son; A proud and bright-eyed stripling; scarce fifteen years he had, But free of hall and chamber: Duke August loved the lad. X He saw the forceful homage; he heard the shouts that came From base throats, or unwilling, but equally of shame: He thought: “One man has done it,—one life would free the land, But all are slaves and cowards, and none will lift a hand! XI “My grandsire hugged a bear to death, when broke his hunting-spear, And has this little Frenchman a muzzle I should fear? If kings are cowed, and princes, and all the land is scared, Perhaps a boy can show them the thing they might have dared!” XII Napoleon on the morrow was coming once again, (And all the castle knew it) without his courtly train; And, when the stairs were mounted, there was no other road But one long, lonely passage, to where the Duke abode. XIII None guessed the secret purpose the silent stripling kept: Deep in the night he waited, and, when his father slept, Took from the rack of weapons a musket old and tried, And cleaned the lock and barrel, and laid it at his side. XIV He held it fast in slumber, he lifted it in dreams Of sunlit mountain-forests and stainless mountain-streams; And in the morn he loaded—the load was bullets three: “For Deutschland—for Duke August—and now the third for me!” XV “What! ever wilt be hunting?” the stately Marshal cried; “I'll fetch a stag of twenty!” the pale-faced boy replied, As, clad in forest color, he sauntered through the court, And said, when none could hear him: “Now, may the time be short!” XVI The corridor was vacant, the windows full of sun; He stole within the midmost, and primed afresh his gun; Then stood, with all his senses alert in ear and eye To catch the lightest signal that showed the Emperor nigh. XVII A sound of wheels: a silence: the muffled sudden jar Of guards their arms presenting: a footstep mounting far, Then nearer, briskly nearer,—a footstep, and alone! And at the farther portal appeared Napoleon! XVIII Alone, his hands behind him, his firm and massive head With brooded plans uplifted, he came with measured tread: And yet, those feet had shaken the nations from their poise, And yet, that will to shake them depended on the boy's! XIX With finger on the trigger, the gun held hunter-wise, His rapid heart-beats sending the blood to brain and eyes, The boy stood, firm and deadly,—another moment's space, And then the Emperor saw him, and halted, face to face. XX A mouth as cut in marble, an eye that pierced and stung As might a god's, all-seeing, the soul of one so young: A look that read his secret, that lamed his callow will, That inly smiled, and dared him his purpose to fulfil! XXI As one a serpent trances, the boy, forgetting all, Felt but that face, nor noted the harmless musket's fall; Nor breathed, nor thought, nor trembled; but, pale and cold as stone, Saw pass, nor look behind him, the calm Napoleon. XXII And these two kept their secret; but from that day began The sense of fate and duty that made the boy a man; And long he lived to tell it,—and, better, lived to say: “God's purposes were grander: He thrust me from His way!” 1869. THE ACCOLADE I Under the lamp in the tavern yard The beggars and thieves were met; Ruins of lives that were evil-starred, Battered bodies and faces hard, A loveless and lawless set. II The cans were full, if the scrip was lean; A fiddler played to the crowd The high-pitched lilt of a tune obscene, When there entered the gate, in garments mean, A stranger tall and proud. III There was danger in their doubting eyes; “Now who are you?” they said. “One who has been more wild than wise, Who has played with force and fed on lies, As you on your mouldy bread. IV “The false have come to me, high and low, Where I only sought the true: I am sick of sham and sated with show; The honest evil I fain would know, In the license here with you.” V “He shall go!” “He shall stay!” In hot debate Their whims and humors ran, When Jack o' the Strong Arm square and straight Stood up, like a man whose word is fate, A reckless and resolute man. VI “Why brawl,” said he, “at so slight a thing? Are fifty afraid of one? We have taken a stranger into our ring Ere this, and made him in sport our king; So let it to-night be done! VII “Fetch him a crown of tinsel bright, For sceptre a tough oak-staff; And who most serves to the King's delight, The King shall dub him his own true knight, And I swear the King shall laugh!” VIII They brought him a monstrous tinsel crown, They put the staff in his hand; There was wrestling and racing up and down, There was song of singer and jest of clown, There was strength and sleight-of-hand. IX The King, he pledged them with clink of can, He laughed with a royal glee; There was dull mistrust when the sports began, There was roaring mirth when the rearmost man Gave out, and the ring was free. X For Jack o' the Strong Arm strove with a will, With the wit and the strength of four; There was never a part he dared not fill, Wrestler, and singer, and clown, until The motley struggle was o'er. XI And ever he turned from the deft surprise, And ever from strain or thrust, With a dumb appeal in his laughing guise, And gazed on the King with wistful eyes, Panting, and rough with dust. XII “Kneel, Jack o' the Strong Arm! Our delight Hath most been due to thee,” Said the King, and stretched his rapier bright: “Rise, Sir John Armstrong, our true knight, Bold, fortunate, and free!” XIII Jack o' the Strong Arm knelt and bowed, To meet the christening blade; He heard the shouts of the careless crowd, And murmured something, as though he vowed, When he felt the accolade. XIV He kissed the King's hand tenderly, Full slowly then did rise, And within him a passion seemed to be; For his choking throat they all could see, And the strange tears in his eyes. XV From his massive breast the rags he threw, He threw them from body and limb. Till, bare as a new-born babe to view, He faced them, no longer the man they knew: They silently stared at him. XVI “O King!” he said, “thou wert King, I knew; I am verily knight, O King! What thou hast done thou canst not undo; Thou hast come to the false and found the true In the carelessly ventured thing. XVII “As I cast away these rags I have worn, The life that was in them I cast; Take me, naked and newly born, Test me with power and pride and scorn, I shall be true to the last!” XVIII His large, clear eyes were weak as he spoke, But his mouth was firm and strong; And a cry from the thieves and beggars broke, As the King took off his own wide cloak And covered him from the throng. XIX He gave him his royal hand in their sight, And he said, before the ring: “Come with me, Sir John! Be leal and right; If I have made thee all of a knight, Thou hast made me more of a king!” 1871. ERIC AND AXEL I Though they never divided my meat or wine, Yet Eric and Axel are friends of mine; Never shared my sorrow, nor laughed with my glee, Yet Eric and Axel are dear to me; And faithfuller comrades no man ever knew Than Eric and Axel, the fearless, the true! II When I hit the target, they feel no pride; When I spin with the waltzers, they wait outside; When the holly of Yule-tide hangs in the hall, And kisses are freest, they care not at all; When I sing, they are silent; I speak, they obey, Eric and Axel, my hope and my stay! III They wait for my coming; they know I shall come, When the dancers are faint and the fiddlers numb, With a shout of “Ho, Eric!” and “Axel, ho!” As we skim the wastes of the Norrland snow, And their frozen breath to a silvery gray Turns Eric's raven and Axel's bay. IV By the bondehus and the herregoard, O'er the glassy pavement of frith and flord, Through the tall fir-woods, that like steel are drawn On the broadening red of the rising dawn, Till one low roof, where the hills unfold, Shelters us all from the angry cold. V I tell them the secret none else shall hear; I love her, Eric, I love my dear! I love her, Axel; wilt love her, too, Though her eyes are dark and mine are blue? She has eyes like yours, so dark and clear: Eric and Axel will love my dear! VI They would speak if they could; but I think they know Where, when the moon is thin, they shall go, To wait awhile in the sleeping street, To hasten away upon snow-shod feet,— Away and away, ere the morning star Touches the tops of the spires of Calmàr! VII Per, the merchant, may lay at her feet His Malaga wine and his raisins sweet, Brought in his ships from Portugal land, And I am as bare as the palm of my hand; But she sighs for me, and she sighs for you, Eric and Axel, my comrades true! VIII You care not, Eric, for gold and wine; You care not, Axel, for show and shine; But you care for the touch of the hand that 's dear, And the voice that fondles you through the ear, And you shall save us, through storm and snow, When she calls: “Ho, Eric!” and “Axel, ho!” 1871. THE PICTURE OF ST. JOHN INTRODUCTORY NOTE In regard to the subject of this poem I have nothing to say. I grew naturally out of certain developments in my own mind; and the story, unsuggested by any legend or detached incident whatever, shaped itself to suit the theme. The work of time, written only as its own necessity prompted, and finished with the care and conscience which such a venture demands, I surrender it to the judgment of the reader. The form of the stanza which I have adopted, however, requires a word of explanation. I have endeavored to strike a middle course between the almost inevitable monotony of an unvarying stanza, in a poem of this length, and the loose character which the heroic measure assumes when arbitrarily rhymed, without the check of regularly recurring divisions. It seemed to me that this object might be best accomplished by adhering rigidly to the measure and limit of the stanza, yet allowing myself freedom of rhyme within that limit. The ottava rima is undoubtedly better adapted for the purposes of a romantic epic than either the Spenserian stanza or the heroic couplet; but it needs the element of humor (as in Byron's “Don Juan”) to relieve its uniform sweetness. On the other hand, the proper compactness and strength of rhythm can with difficulty be preserved in a poem where all form of stanza is discarded. My aim has been, as far as possible, to combine the advantages and lessen the objections of both. I know of but one instance in which the experiment has been even partially tried,—the “Oberon” of Wieland, wherein the rhymes are wilfully varied, and sometimes the measure, the stanza almost invariably closing with an Alexandrine. In the present case, I have been unable to detect any prohibitory rule in the genius of our language; and the only doubt which suggested itself to my mind was that the ear, becoming swiftly accustomed to the arrangement of rhyme in one stanza, might expect to find it reproduced in the next. I believe, however, that such disappointment, if it should now and then occur, will be very transitory,—that even an unusually delicate ear will soon adjust itself to the changing order, and find that the varied harmony at which I have aimed (imperfectly as I may have succeeded) compensates for the lack of regularity. At times, I confess, the temptation to close with an Alexandrine was very great; but it was necessary to balance the one apparent license by a rigid adherence to the customary form in all other respects. Hence, also, I have endeavored, as frequently as possible, to use but three rhymes in a stanza, in order to strengthen my experiment with an increased effect of melody. I have found, since the completion of the poem, that it contains more than seventy variations in the order of rhyme, not all of which, of course, can be pronounced equally agreeable: nor does this freedom involve less labor than a single form of stanza, because the variations must be so arranged as to relieve and support each other. My object has been, not to escape the laws which Poetry imposes, but to select a form which gives greater appearance of unrestrained movement, and more readily reflects the varying moods of the poem. PROEM TO THE ARTISTS I Because no other dream my childhood knew Than your bright Goddess sends,—that earliest Her face I saw, and from her bounteous breast, All others dry, the earliest nurture drew; And since the hope, so lovely, was not true, To write my life in colors,—win a place Among your ranks, though humble, yet with grace That might accord me brotherhood with you: II Because the dream, thus cherished, gave my life Its first faint sense of beauty, and became. Even when the growing years to other strife Led forth my feet, a shy, secluded flame: And ye received me, when our pathways met, As one long parted, but of kindred fate; And in one heaven our kindred stars are set; To you, my Brethren, this be dedicate! III And though some sportive nymph the channel turned, And led to other fields mine infant rill, The sense of fancied destination still Leaps in its waves, and will not be unlearned. I charge not Fate with having done me wrong; Much hath she granted, though so much was spurned; But leave the keys of Color, silent long, And pour my being through the stops of Song! IV Even as one breath the organ-pipe compels To yield that note which through the minster swells In chorded thunder, and the hollow lyre Beneath its gentler touches to awake The airy monotones that fan desire, And thrills the fife with blood of battle,—so Our natures from one source their music take, And side by side to one far Beauty flow! V And I have measured, in fraternal pride, Your reverence, your faith, your patient power Of stern self-abnegation; and have tried The range between your brightest, darkest hour, The path of chill neglect, and that so fair With praise upspringing like a wind-sown flower: But, whether thorns or amaranths ye wear, Your speech is mine, your sacrifice, your prayer! VI Permit me, therefore, ye who nearest stand, Among the worthiest, and kindliest known In contact of our lives, to take the hand Whose grasp assures me I am not alone; For thus companioned, I shall find the tone Of flowing song, and all my breath command. Your names I veil from those who should not see, Not from yourselves, my Friends, and not from me! VII You, underneath whose brush the autumn day Draws near the sunset which it never finds,— Whose art the smoke of Indian Summer binds Beyond the west-wind's power to breathe away: Who fix the breakers in their gifted grace And stretch the sea-horizon, dim and gray, I'll call you Opal,—so your tints enchase The pearly atmospheres wherein they play. VIII And you, who love the brown October field, The lingering leaves that flutter as they cling, And each forlorn but ever-lovely thing,— To whom elegiac Autumn hath revealed Her sweetest dirges, Bloodstone: for the hue Of sombre meadows to your palette cleaves, And lowering skies, with sunlight breaking through, And flecks of crimson on the scattered leaves! IX You, Topaz, clasp the full-blown opulence Of Summer: many a misty mountain-range Or smoky valley, specked with warrior-tents, Basks on your canvas: then, with grander change, We climb to where your mountain twilight gleams In spectral pomp, or nurse the easeful sense Which through your Golden Day forever dreams By lakes and sunny hills, and falling streams. X You banish color from your cheerful cell, O Paros! but a stern imperial form Stands in the marble moonlight where you dwell, A Poet's head, with grand Ionian beard, And Phidian dreams, that shine against the storm Of toilful life, the white robe o'er them cast Of breathless Beauty: yours the art, endeared To men and gods, first born, enduring last. XI You, too, whom how to name I may not guess, Except the jacinth and the ruby, blent, The native warmth of life might represent, Which, drawn from barns and homesteads, you express, Or vintage revels, round the maple-tree; Or when the dusky race you quaintly dress In art that gives them finer liberty,— Made by your pencil, ere by battle, free! XII Where'er my feet have strayed, whatever shore I visit, there your venturous footprints cling. From Chimborazo unto Labrador One sweeps the Continent with eagle wing, To dip his brush in tropic noon, or fires Of Arctic night; one sets his seal upon Far Colorado's cleft, colossal spires, And lone, snow-kindled cones of Oregon! XIII Another through the mystic moonlight floats That silvers Venice; and another sees The blazoned galleys and the gilded boats Bring home her Doges: Andalusian leas, Gray olive-slopes, and mountains sun-embrowned Entice another, and from ruder ground Of old Westphalian homes another brings Enchanted memories of the meanest things. XIV To each and all, the hand of fellowship! A poet's homage (should that title fall From other lips than mine) to each and all! For, whether this pale star of Song shall dip To swift forgetfulness, or burn beside Accepted lamps of Art's high festival, Its flame was kindled at our shrines allied, In double faith, and from a twofold call! August 30, 1865. BOOK I THE ARTIST I Complete the altar stands: my task is done. Awhile from sacred toil and silent prayer I rest, and never shone the vale so fair As now, beneath the mellow autumn sun, And overbreathed by tinted autumn air! In drowsy murmurs slide the mountain rills, And, save of light, the whole wide heaven is bare Above the happy slumber of the hills. II Here, as a traveller whose feet have clomb A weary mountain-slope, may choose his seat, And resting, track the ways that he hath come,— The broken landscapes, level far below, The turf that kissed, the flints that tore his feet, And each dim speck that once was bliss or woe,— I breathe a space, between two sundered lives, And view what now is ended, what survives. III Such as I am, I am: in soul and sense Distinct, existing in my separate right, And though a Power, beyond my clouded sight, Spun from a thousand gathered filaments My cord of life, within its inmost core That life is mine: its torture, its delight, Repeat not those that ever were before Or ever shall be: mine are Day and Night. IV God gives to most an order which supplies Their passive substance, and they move therein. To some He grants the beating wings that rise In endless aspiration, till they win An awful vision of a deeper sin And loftier virtue, other earth and skies: And those their common help from each may draw, But these must perish, save they find the law. V Vain to evade and useless to bewail My fortune! One among the scattered few Am I: by sharper lightning, sweeter dew Refreshed or blasted,—on a wilder gale Caught up and whirled aloft, till, hither borne, My story pauses. Ere I drop the veil Once let me take the Past in calm review, Then eastward turn, and front the riper morn. VI What sire begat me, and what mother nursed, What hills the blue frontiers of Earth I thought, Or how my young ambition scaled them first, It matters not: but I was finely wrought Beyond their elements from whom I came. A nimbler life informed mine infant frame: The gauzy wings some Psyche-fancy taught To flutter, soulless custom could not tame. VII Our state was humble,—yet above the dust, If deep below the stars,—the state that feeds Impatience, hinting yet denying needs, And thus, on one side ever forward thrust And on the other cruelly repressed, My nature grew,—a wild-flower in the weeds,— And hurt by ignorant love, that fain had blessed, I sought some other bliss wherein to rest. VIII And, wandering forth, a child that could not know The thing for which he pined, in sombre woods And echo-haunted mountain-solitudes I learned a rapture from the blended show Of form and color, felt the soul that broods In lonely scenes, the moods that come and go O'er wayward Nature, making her the haunt Of Art's forerunner, Love's eternal want. IX Long ere the growing instinct reached my hand, It filled my brain: a pang of joy was born, When, soft as dew, across the dewy land Of Summer, leaned the crystal-hearted Morn; And when the lessening day shone yellow-cold On fallow glebe and stubble, I would stand And feel a dumb despair its wings unfold, And wring my hands, and weeps as one forlorn. X At first in play, but soon with heat and stir Of joy that hails discovered power, I tried To mimic form, and taught mine eye to guide The unskilled fingers. Praise became a spur To overtake success, for in that vale The simple people's wonder did not fail, Nor vulgar prophecies, which yet confer The first delicious thrills of faith and pride. XI So, as on shining pinions lifted o'er The perilous bridge of boyhood, I advanced. In warmer air the misty Mænads danced, And Sirens sang on many a rising shore, And Glory's handmaids beckoned me to choose The freshest of the unworn wreaths they bore; So gracious Fortune showed, so fair the hues Wherewith she paints her cloud-built avenues! XII Ere up through all this airy ecstasy The clamorous pulses of the senses beat, And half the twofold man, maturing first, Usurped its share of life, and bade me see The ways of pleasure opening for my feet, I stood alone: the tender breast that nursed, The loins from whence I sprang, alike were cold, And mine the humble roof, the scanty gold. XIII The pale, cold azure of my mountain sky Became a darkness: Arber's head unshorn No temple crowned,—not here could fame be born; And, nor with gold nor knowledge weighted, I Set forth, and o'er the green Bavarian land, A happy wanderer, fared: the hour was nigh When, in the home of Art, my feet should stand Where Time and Power have kissed the Painter's hand! XIV Oh, sweet it was, when, from that bleak abode Where avalanches grind the pines to dust, And crouching glaciers down the hollows thrust Their glittering claws, I took the sunward road, Making my guide the torrent, that before My steps ran shouting, giddy with its joy, And tossed its white hands like a gamesome boy, And sprayed its rainbow frolics o'er and o'er! XV Full-orbed, in rosy dusk, the perfect moon That evening shone: the torrent's noise, afar, No longer menaced, but with mellow tune Sang to the twinkle of a silver star, Above the opening valley. “Italy!” The moon, the star, the torrent, said to me,— “Sleep thou in peace, the morning will unbar These Alpine gates, and give thy world to thee!” XVI And morning did unfold the jutting capes Of chestnut-wooded hills, that held embayed Warm coves of fruit, the pine's Æolian shade, Or pillared bowers, blue with suspended grapes;— A land whose forms some livelier grace betrayed; Where motion sang and cheerful color laughed, And only gloomed, amid the dancing shapes Of vine and bough, the pointed cypress-shaft! XVII On,—on, through broadening vale and brightening sun I walked, and hoary in their old repose The olives twinkled: many a terrace rose, With marbles crowned and jasmine overrun, And orchards where the ivory silkworm spun. On leafy palms outspread, its pulpy fruit The fig-tree held; and last, the charm to close, A dark-eyed shepherd piped a reedy flute. XVIII My heart beat loud: I walked as in a dream Where simplest actions, touched with marvel, seem Enchanted yet familiar: for I knew The orchards, terraces, and breathing flowers, The tree from Adam's garden, and the blue Sweet sky behind the light aerial towers; And that young faun that piped, had piped before,— I knew my home: the exile now was o'er! XIX And when the third rich day declined his lids, I floated where the emerald waters fold Gem-gardens, fairy island-pyramids, Whereon the orange hangs his globes of gold,— Which aloes crown with white, colossal plume, Above the beds where lavish Nature bids Her sylphs of odor endless revel hold, Her zones of flowers in balmy congress bloom! XX I hailed them all, and hailed beyond, the plain; The palace-fronts, on distant hills uplift, White as the morning-star; the streams that drift In sandy channels to the Adrian main: Till one still eve, with duplicated stain Of crimson sky and wave, disclosed to me The domes of Venice, anchored on the sea, Far-off,—an airy city of the brain! XXI Forth from the shores of Earth we seemed to float, Drawn by that vision,—hardly felt the breeze That left one glassy ripple from the boat To break the smoothness of the silken seas; And far and near, as from the lucent air, Came vesper chimes and wave-born melodies. So might one die, if Death his soul could bear So gently, Heaven before him float so fair! XXII This was the gate to Artists' Fairyland. The palpitating waters kissed the shores, Gurgled in sparkling coils beneath the oars, And lapped the marble stairs on either hand, Summoning Beauty to her holiday: While noiseless gondolas at palace-doors Waited, and over all, in charmed delay, San Marco's moon gazed from her golden stand! XXIII A silent city! where no clattering wheels Jar the white pavement: cool the streets, and dumb, Save for a million whispering waves, which come To light their mellow darkness: where the peals Of Trade's harsh clarions never vex the ear, But the wide blue above, the green below, Her pure Palladian palaces insphere,— Piles, on whose steps the grass shall never grow! XXIV I sat within the courts of Veronese And saw his figures breathe luxurious air, And felt the sunshine of their lustrous hair. Beneath the shade of Titian's awful trees I stood, and watched the Martyr's brow grow cold: Then came Giorgione, with his brush of gold, To paint the dames that make his memory fair,— The happy dames that never shall be old! XXV But most I lingered in that matchless hall Where soars Madonna with adoring arms Outspread, while deepening glories round her fall, And every feature of her mortal charms Becomes immortal, at the Father's call: Beneath her, silver-shining cherubs fold The clouds that bear her, slowly heavenward rolled: The Sacred Mystery broodeth over all! XXVI And still, as one asleep, I turned away To see the crimson of her mantle burn In sunset clouds, the pearly deeps of day Filled with cherubic faces,—ah, to spurn My hopeless charts of pictures yet to be, And feed the fancies of a swift despair, Which mocked me from the azure arch of air, And from the twinkling beryl of the sea! XXVII If this bright bloom were inaccessible Which clad the world, and thus my senses stung, How could I catch the mingled tints that clung To cheek and throat, and softly downward fell In poise of shoulders and the breathing swell Of woman's bosom? How the life in eyes, The glory on the loosened hair that lies, The nameless music o'er her being flung? XXVIII Or how create anew the sterner grace In man's heroic muscles sheathed or shown, Whether he stoops from the immortal zone Bare and majestic, god in limbs and face; Or lies, a faun, beside his mountain flock; Or clasps, a satyr, nymphs among the vine; Or kneels, a hermit, in his cell of rock; Or sees, a saint, his palms of glory shine! XXIX I took a fisher from the Lido's strand, A youthful shape, by toil and vice unworn, Upon his limbs a golden flush like morn, And on his mellow cheek the roses tanned Of health and joy. Perchance the soul I missed, From mine exalted fancy might be born: With eye upraised and locks by sunshine kissed, I painted him as the Evangelist. XXX In vain!—the severance of his lips expressed Kisses of love whereon his fancy fed, And the warm tints each other sweetly wed In slender limb and balanced arch of breast, So keen with life, so marked in every line With unideal nature, none had guessed The dream that cheered me and the faith that led; But human all I would have made divine! XXXI I found a girl before San Marco's shrine Kneeling in gilded gloom: her tawny hair Rippled across voluptuous shoulders bare, And something in the altar-taper's shine Sparkled like falling tears. This girl shall be My sorrowing Magdalen, as guilty-sweet, I said, as when, pure Christ! she knelt to thee, And laid her blushing forehead on thy feet! XXXII She sat before me. Like a sunny brook Poured the unbraided ripples softly round The balmy dells, but left one snowy mound Bare in its beauty: then I met her look,— The conquering gaze of those bold eyes, which made, Ah, God! the unrepented sin more fair Than Magdalen kneeling with her humbled hair, Or Agatha beneath the quæstor's blade! XXXIII What if my chaste ambition wavered then? What if the veil from mine own nature fell And I obeyed the old Circean spell, And lived for living, not for painted men? Youth follows Life, as bees the honey-bell, And nightingales the northward march of Spring, And once, a dazzled moth, must try his wing, Though but to scorch it in the blaze of Hell! XXXIV Why only mimic what I might possess? The cheated sense that revels in delight Mocked at my long denial: touch and sight, The warmth of wine, the sensuous loveliness Of offered lips and bosoms breaking through The parted bodice: winds whose faint caress And wandering hands the daintiest dreams renew: The sea's absorbing and embracing blue: XXXV Of these are woven our being's outward veil Of rich sensation, which has power to part The pure, untroubled soul and drunken heart,— A screen of gossamer, but giants fail The bright, enchanted web to rend in twain. Two spirits dwell in us: one chaste and pale, A still recluse, whose garments know no stain, Whose patient lips are closed upon her pain: XXXVI The other bounding to her cymbal's clang, A bold Bacchante, panting with the race Of joy, the triumph and the swift embrace, And gathering in one cup the grapes that hang From every vine of Youth: around her head The royal roses bare their hearts of red; Music is on her lips, and from her face Fierce freedom shines and wild, alluring grace! XXXVII Who shall declare that ever side by side To weave harmonious fate these spirits wrought? To whom came ever one's diviner pride And one's full measure of delight, unsought? Who dares the cells of blood enrich, exhaust, Or trust his fortune unto either guide?— So interbalanced hangs the equal cost Of what is ordered and of what is taught! XXXVIII Surprised to Passion, my awakened life Whirled onward in a warm, delirious maze, At first reluctant, and with pangs of strife That dashed their bitter o'er my honeyed days, Until my soul's affrighted nun withdrew And left me free: for light that other's chains As garlands seemed, and fresh her wine as dew, And wide her robes to hide the banquet-stains! XXXIX Those were the days of Summer which intrude Their sultry fervor on the realm of Spring, And push its buds to sudden blossoming; When earth and air, with panting love imbued, O'erpower the subject life, and ceaseless dart All round the warm horizon of the heart Heat-lightnings in the sky of youth, which first Regains its freshness when the bolts have burst. XL And thus, when that Sirocco's breath had passed, A refluent wind of health swept o'er my brain, Cold, swift, and searching; and before it fast Fled the uncertain, misty shapes which cast Their glory on my dreams. The ardor vain That would have snatched, unearned, slow labor's crown, Was dimmed; and half with courage, half with pain, I guessed the path that led to old renown. XLI I turned my pictures, pitying the while My boyish folly, for I could not yet The dear deception of my youth forget, And though it parted from me like an isle Of the blue sea behind some rushing keel, Still from the cliffs its temple seemed to smile, Fairer in fading: future morns reveal No bowers so bright as yesterdays conceal. XLII The laughing boys that on the marble piers Lounge with their dangling feet above the wave; The tawny faces of the gondoliers; The low-browed girl, whose scarce-unfolded years But half the lightning of her glances gave;— I sketched in turn, with busy hand and brave, And crushed my clouded hope's recurring pang, And sweet “Ti voglio bene assaï” sang. XLIII Then came the hour when I must say farewell To silent Venice in her crystal nest,— When with the last peals of San Marco's bell Her hushed and splendid pageant closed, and fell Like her own jewel in the ocean's breast. Belfry, and dome, and the superb array Of wave-born temples floated far away, And the dull shores received me in the west. XLIV And past the Euganæan hills, that break The Adrian plain, I wandered to the Po, And saw Ferrara, vacant in her woe, Clasp the dim cell wherein her children take A ghastly pride from her immortal shame; And hailed Bologna, for Caracci's sake,— The master bold, who scorned to court his fame, But bared his arm and dipped his brush in flame. XLV Through many a dark-red dell of Apennine, With chestnut-shadows in its brookless bed, By flinty slopes whose only dew is wine, And hills the olives gave a hoary head, I climbed to seek the sunny vale where flows The Tuscan river,—where, when Art was dead, Lorenzo's spring thawed out the ages' snows. And green with life the eternal plant arose! XLVI At last, from Pratolino's sloping crest, I saw the far, aerial, purple gleam, As from Earth's edge a fairer orb might seem In softer air and sunnier beauty dressed, And onward swift with panting bosom pressed, Like one whose wavering will pursues a dream And shrinks from waking; but the vision grew With every step distinct in form and hue: XLVII Till on the brink of ancient Fiesolé, Mute, breathless, hanging o'er the dazzling deeps Of broad Val d'Arno, which the sinking day Drowned in an airy bath of rosy ray,— An atmosphere more dream-imbued than Sleep's,— My feet were stayed; with sweet and sudden tears, And startled lifting of the cloud that lay Upon the landscape of the future years! XLVIII I leaned against a cypress-bole, afraid With blind foretaste of coming ecstasy, So rarely on the soul the joy to be Prophetic dawns, so frequent falls the shade Of near misfortune! All my senses sang, And lark-like soared and jubilant and free The flock of dreams, that from my bosom sprang, O'er yonder towers to hover and to hang! XLIX Then, as the dusty road I downward paced, A phantom arch was ever builded nigh To span my coming, luminous and high; And airy columns, crowned with censers, graced The dreamful pomp,—with many a starry bell From garlands woven in the fading sky, And noiseless fountains shimmered, as they fell, Like meteor-fires that haunt a fairy dell! L Two maids, upon a terrace that o'erhung The highway, lightly strove in laughing play Each one the other's wreath to snatch away, With backward-bending heads, and arms that clung In intertwining beauty. Both were young, And one as my Madonna-dream was fair; And she the garland from the other's hair Caught with a cunning hand, and poised, and flung. LI A fragrant ring of jasmine flowers, it sped, Dropping their elfin trumpets in its flight, And downward circling, on my startled head Some angel bade the diadem alight! The cool green leaves and breathing blossoms white Embraced my brow with dainty, mute caress: I stood in rapt amazement, soul and sight Surrendered to that vision's loveliness. LII She, too, stood, smitten with the wondrous chance Whereby the freak of her unwitting hand A stranger's forehead crowned. I saw her stand, Most like some flying Hour, that, in her dance Perceives a god, and drops her courser's rein: Then, while I drank the fulness of her glance, Crept over throat and cheek a bashful stain,— She fled, yet flying turned, and looked again. LIII And I went forward, consecrated, blest, And garlanded like some returning Faun From Pan's green revels in the woodland's breast. Here was a crown to give Ambition rest, A wreath for infant Love to slumber on! And blended, both in mine enchantment shone, Till Love was only Fame familiar grown, And Fame but Love triumphantly expressed! LIV Such moments come to all whom Art elects To serve her,—Poet, Painter, Sculptor feel, Once in their lives the shadows which conceal Achievement lifted, and the world's neglects Are spurned behind them, like the idle dust Whirled from Hyperion's golden chariot-wheel: Once vexing doubt is dumb, and long disgust Allayed, and Time and Fate and Fame are just! LV It is enough, if underneath our rags A single hour the monarch's purple shows. In dearth of praise no true ambition flags, And by his self-belief the student knows The master: nor was ever wholly dark The Artist's life. Though timid fortune lags Behind his hope, there comes a day to mark The late renown that round his name shall close. LVI I dared not question my prophetic pride, But entered Florence as a conqueror, To whom should ope the Tribune's sacred door, Hearing his step afar. On every side Great works fed faith in greatness that endured Irrecognition, patient to abide Neglect that stung, temptations that allured,— Supremely proud and in itself secured! LVII From the warm bodies Titian loved to paint, Where life still palpitates in languid glow; From Raphael's heads of Virgin and of Saint, Bright with divinest message; from the slow And patient grandeur Leonardo wrought; From soft, effeminate Carlo Dolce, faint With vapid sweetness, to the Titan thought That shaped the dreams of Michel Angelo: LVIII From each and all, through varied speech, I drew One sole, immortal revelation. They No longer mocked me with the hopeless view Of power that with them died, but gave anew The hope of power that cannot pass away While Beauty lives: the passion of the brain Demands possession, nor shall yearn in vain: Its nymph, though coy, did never yet betray. LIX It is not much to earn the windy praise That fans our early promise: every child Wears childhood's grace: in unbelieving days On spark of earnest faith left undefiled Will burn and brighten like the lamps of old, And men cry out in haste: “Behold, a star!” Deeming some glow-worm light, that soon is cold, The radiant god's approaching avatar! LX So I was hailed: and something fawn-like, shy, Caught from the loneliness of mountain-glens, That clung around me, drew the stranger's eye And held my life apart from other men's. Their prophecies were sweet, and if they breathed But ignorant hope and shallow pleasure, I No less from them already saw bequeathed The crown by avaricious Glory wreathed. LXI And, climbing up to San Miniato's height, Among the cypresses I made a nest For wandering fancy: down the shimmering west The Arno slid in creeping coils of light: O'er Boboli's fan-like pines the city lay In tints that freshly blossomed on the sight, Enringed with olive-orchards, thin and gray, Like moonlight falling in the lap of day. LXII There sprang, before me, Giotto's ivory tower; There hung, a planet, Brunelleschi's dome: Of living dreams Val d'Arno seemed the home, From far Careggi's dim-seen laurel bower To Bellosguardo, smiling o'er the vale; And pomp and beauty and supremest power, Blending and brightening in their bridal hour, Made even the blue of Tuscan summers pale! LXIII Immortal Masters! Ye who drank this air And made it spirit, as the must makes wine, Be ye the intercessors of my prayer, Pure Saints of Art, around her holy shrine! The purpose of your lives bestow on mine,— The child-like heart, the true, laborious hand And pious vision,—that my soul may dare One day to climb the summits where ye stand! LXIV Say, shall my memory walk in yonder street Beside your own, ye ever-living shades? Shall pilgrims come, gray men and pensive maids, To pluck this moss because it knew my feet, And forms of mine move o'er the poet's mind In thoughts that still to haunting music beat, And Love and Grief and Adoration find Their speech in pictures I shall leave behind? LXV Ah! they, the Masters, toiled where I but dreamed! The crown was ready ere they dared to claim One leaf of honor: then, around them gleamed No Past, where rival souls of splendid name At once inspire and bring despair of fame. A naked heaven was o'er them, where to set Their kindled stars; and thus the palest yet Exalted burns o'er all that later came. LXVI They unto me were gods: for, though I felt That nobler 't was, creating, even to fail Than grandly imitate, my spirit knelt, Unquestioning, to their authority. I learned their lives, intent to find a tale Resembling mine, and deemed my vision free When most their names obscured with flattering veil That light of Art which first arose in me. LXVII And less for Beauty's single sake inspired Than old interpretations to attain, I sought with restless hand and heated brain Their truth to reach,—by his example fired Who sketched his mountain-goats on rock or sand. And his, the wondrous boy, beneath whose hand, Conferring sanctity with sweet disdain, A cask became a shrine, a hut a fane. LXVIII My studio was the street, the marketplace: I snared the golden spirit of the sun Amid his noonday freedom,—swiftly won The unconscious gift from many a passing face,— The spoils of color caught from dazzling things, From unsuspecting forms the sudden grace, Alive with hope to find the hidden wings Of the Divine that from the Human springs. LXIX A jasmine garland hung above my bed, Withered and dry: beneath, a picture hung,— A shadowy likeness of the maid who flung That crown of welcome. On my sleeping head The glory of the vanished sunset fell, And still the leaves reviving fragrance shed, And dreams crept out of every jasmine-bell, Inebriate with their fairy hydromel. LXX Where was my lost Armida? She had grown A phantom shape, a star of dreams, alone; And I no longer dared to touch the dim Unfinished features, lest my brush should mar A memory swift as wings of cherubim That unto saints in prayer may flash afar Up the long steep of rifted cloudy walls, Wherethrough the overpowering glory falls. LXXI But, as the Rose will lend its excellence To the unlovely earth in which it grows, Until the sweet earth says, “I serve the Rose,” So, penetrant with her was every sense. She filled me as the moon a sleeping sea, That shows the night her orb reflected thence, Yet deems itself all darkness: silently The dream of her betrayed itself in me. LXXII I had a cherished canvas, whereupon An antique form of inspiration grew To other life: beneath a sky of blue, Filled with the sun and limpid yet with dawn, A palm-tree rose: its glittering leaves were bowed As though to let no ray of sunlight through. Their folded shade, and kept the early dew On all the flowers within its hovering cloud. LXXIII Madonna's girlish form, arrested there With poising foot, and parted lips, and eyes With innocent wonder, bright and glad surprise, And hands half-clasped in rapture or in prayer, Met the Announcing Angel. On her sight He burst in splendor from the sunny air, Making it dim around his perfect light, And in his hand the lily-stem he bare. LXXIV Naught else, save, nestling near the Virgin's feet, A single lamb that wandered from its flock, And one white dove, upon a splintered rock Above the yawning valleys, dim with heat. Beyond, the rifted hills of Gilead flung Their phantom shadows on the burning veil, And, far away, one solitary, pale Vermilion cloud above the Desert hung. LXXV I painted her, a budding, spotless maid, That has not dreamed of man,—for God's high choice Too humble, yet too pure to be afraid, And from the music of the Angel's voice And from the lily's breathing heart of gold Inspired to feel the mystic beauty laid Upon her life: the secret is untold, Unconsciously the message is obeyed. LXXVI How much I failed, myself alone could know; How much achieved, the world. My picture took Its place with others in the public show, And many passed, and some remained to look. While I, in flushed expectancy and fear, Stood by to watch the gazers come and go, To note each pausing face, perchance to hear A careless whisper tell me Fame was near. LXXVII “'T is Ghirlandajo's echo!” some would say; And others, “Here one sees a pupil's hand.” “An innovation, crude, but fairly planned,” Remarked the connoisseur, and moved away, Sublimely grave: but one, sometimes, would stand Silent, with brightening face. No more than this, Though voiceless praise, ambition could demand, And for an hour I felt the Artist's bliss. LXXVIII One day, a man of haughty port drew nigh,— A man beyond his prime, but still unbent, Though the first flakes of age already lent Their softness to his brow: his wandering eye Allowed its stately patronage to glide Along the pictures, till, with gaze intent He fixed on mine, and startled wonderment Displaced his air of cold, indifferent pride. LXXIX “Signor Marchese!” cried, approaching, one Who seemed a courtly comrade, “can it be That in these daubs the touch of Art you see,— These foreign moons that ape our native sun?” To whom he said: “The Virgin, Count! 'T is she, My Clelia! like a portrait just begun, Where the design is yet but half avowed, And shimmers on you through a misty cloud: LXXX “So, here, I find her. 'T is a marvellous chance. Your painters choose some peasant beauty's face For their Madonnas, striving to enhance By softer tints her coarse plebeian grace To something heavenly. Here, the features wear A noble stamp: who painted this is fit That Clelia's self beside his canvas sit,— His hand, methinks, might fix her shadow there.” LXXXI “'T is true,—you wed her then, as I have heard, And to the young Colonna?” “Even so: We made the family compact long ago. A wilful blade, they say, but every bird Is wiser when he owns a nested mate; And I shall lose her ere the winter's snow Falls on the Apennine,—a father's fate! But from these two my house again may grow. LXXXII “She lost, her picture in the lonely hall Shall speak, from silent lips, her sweet ‘good-night!’ And soothe my childless fancy. I'll invite This painter to the work: his brush has all The graces of a hand which takes delight In noble forms,—and thus may best recall, Though nameless he, what Palma's brush divine Found in the beauteous mothers of her line!” LXXXIII I heard; but trembling, turned away to hide An ecstasy no longer to be quelled,— The lover's longing and the artist's pride: For, though the growing truth of life dispelled My rash ideal, my very blood had caught The fine infection: from my heart it welled, Colored each feeling, perfumed every thought, And gave desire what hope had left unsought! LXXXIV 'T was blind, unthinking rapture. Who was she, Pandolfo's daughter, young Colonna's bride, The pampered maiden of a house of pride, That I, though but in thought, should bend the knee Before her beauty? She was set too high, And her white lustre wore patrician stains, Like sunshine falling through heraldic panes That rise between the altar and the sky. LXXXV Next day the Marquis came. With antique air Of nicest courtesy, his words did sue The while his tone commanded: could I spare Some hours?—a portrait only, it was true, But the Great Masters painted portraits too, Even Raffaëllo: at his palace, then! The Lady Clelia would await me there: His thanks,—to-morrow, should it be?—at ten. LXXXVI But when the hour approached, and o'er me hung The shadow of the high Palladian walls. My heart beat fast in feverish intervals: I half drew back: the lackeys open flung The brazen portals,—broad before me rose The marble stairs,—above them gleamed the halls, And I ascended, as a man who goes To see some unknown gate of life unclose. LXXXVII They bore my easel to a spacious room Whose northern windows curbed the eager day, But under them a sunny garden lay: A fountain sprang: the myrtles were in bloom, And I remembered,—“ere the winter's snow Cloaks Apennine” Colonna bears away Her who shall wear them. 'T is a woman's doom, I laughed,—she seeks no other: let her go! LXXXVIII Lo! rustling forward with a silken sound, Her living self advanced!—as fair and frail As May's first lily in a Northern vale, As light in airy grace, as when she crowned Her painter's head,—the Genius of my Fame! Ah, words are vain where Music's tongue would fail, And Color's brightest miracles be found Imperfect, cold, to match her as she came! LXXXIX The blood that gathered, stifling, at my heart, Surged back again, and burned on cheek and brow. “Your model!” smiled the Marquis; “you'll avow That she is not unworthy of your art. I see you note the likeness,—it is strange: But since you dreamed her face so nearly, now You'll paint it,—as she is,—I want no change:” Then left, with wave of hand and stately bow. XC A girlish wonder dawned in Clelia's face. Her frank, pure glances seemed to question mine, Or scanned my features, seeking to retrace Her way to me along some gossamer line Of memory, almost found, then lost again. Meanwhile, I set my canvas in its place, Recalled the artist-nature, though with pain, And tamed to work the tumult of my brain. XCI “I give you trouble,” then she gently said. My brow was damp, my hand unsteady. “Nay,” I answered: “'t is the grateful price I pay For that fair wreath you cast upon my head.” She started, blushing: all at once she found The shining clew,—her silvery laughter made The prelude to her words: “the flowers will fade, But by your hand am I forever crowned!” BOOK II THE WOMAN I Oh give not Beauty to an artist's eye And deem his heart, untroubled, can withstand Her necromancy, changing earth and sky To one wide net wherein her captives lie!— Nor, since his mind the measure takes, his hand Essays the semblance of each hue and line, That cold his pulses beat, as if he scanned Her marble death and not her life divine! II How could I view the sombre-shining hair Without the tingling, passionate wish to feel Its silken smoothness? How the golden-pale Pure oval of the face, the forehead fair, The light of eyes whose dusky depths conceal Love's yet unkindled torch, and wear the mail Of cruel Art, that bade me mimic bliss And only paint the mouth I burned to kiss? III So near, the airy wave her voice set free Smote warm against my cheek! So near, I heard The folds that hid her bosom, as they stirred Above the heart-beat measuring now, for me, Life's only music! Ah, so near, and yet Between us rose a wall I could not see, To dash me back,—before the wings that fret For love's release, a crystal barrier set! IV I kissed, in thought, each clear, delicious tint That lured my mocking hand: my passion flung Its lurking sweetness over every print Of the soft brush that to her beauty clung, And fondled while it toiled,—and day by day The canvas brightened with her brightening face: The artist gloried in the picture's grace, But, ah! the lover's chances lapsed away. V And now,—the last! The grapes already wore Victorious purple, ere their trodden death, The olives darkened through their branches hoar, And from below the tuberose's breath Died round the casement, from the spicy shore Of ripened summer, passionate as the sigh I stifled: and my heart said,—“Speak or die! The moment's fate stands fixed forevermore.” VI The naked glare of breezeless afternoon Dazzled without: the garden swooned in heat. The old duenna drooped her head, and soon, Behind the curtain slumbered in her seat. Within my breast the crowded, panting beat Disturbed my hand: the pencil fell: I turned, And with imploring eyes and tears that burned Sank in despairing silence at her feet. VII I did not dare look up, but knelt, as waits A foiled tyrannicide the headsman's blow: At first a frightened hush,—the stealthy, slow, Soft rustle of her dress,—a step like Fate's To crown or smite: but now descended, where Her garland fell, her hand upon my hair, And, light as floating leaf of orchard-snow Loosed by the pulse of Spring, it trembled there. VIII Then I looked up,—Oh, grace of God! to feel Her answering tears like dew upon my brow; To touch and kiss her blessing hand; to seal Without a word the one eternal vow Of man and woman, when their lives unite Thenceforth forever, soul and body shared, Like those the Grecian goddess, pitying, paired To form the young, divine Hermaphrodite. IX I breathed: “You do not love Colonna?” “No,” She whispered, “aid me, I am yours to save!” “I yours to help, your lover and your slave,— My soul, my blood is yours,” I murmured low. The old duenna stirred: “When? where? one hour For your commands!” As hurriedly she gave Reply: “The garden,—yonder darkest bower, When midnight tolls from Santa Croce's tower!” X Ere the immortal light had time to fade In either's eyes, the old Marchese came. I veiled, in toil, the flush that still betrayed, And Clelia, strong to hide her maiden shame, The motion of her father's hand obeyed And left us. Gravely he my work surveyed: “'T is done, I think,—'t is she, indeed,” he said: “'T was time,” he muttered, as he turned his head. XI I bowed in silence, took his offered gold, And down the marble stairs, through doors that cried, On scornful hinges, of their owner's pride, Passed on my way: my happy heart did fold Pandolfo's treasure in its secret hold, And every bell that chimed the feeble day Down to its crimson burial, seemed to say: “Not yet, not yet, for Love our tongues have tolled!” XII More slowly rolled the silver disk above The hiding hills, than ever moon came up: The sky's begemmed and sapphire-tinted cup Spilled o'er its dew, and Heaven in nuptial love Stretched forth his mystic arms, and crouched beside The yearning Earth, his dusky-featured bride: The pulses of the Night began to move, And Life's eternal secret ruled the tide. XIII Along the shadow of the garden-walls I crept: the streets were still, or only beat To wavering echoes by unsteady feet Of wine-flushed revellers from banquet halls. They saw me not: the yielding door I gained, And glided down a darksome alley, sweet With slumbering roses, to the shy retreat Of bashful bliss and yearning unprofaned. XIV The amorous odors of the moveless air,— Jasmine and tuberose and gillyflower, Carnation, heliotrope, and purpling shower Of Persian roses,—kissed my senses there To keenest passion, clad my limbs with power Like some young god's, when at the banquet first He drinks fresh deity with eager thirst,— And midnight rang from Santa Croce's tower! XV She came! a stealthy, startled, milk-white fawn, Thridding the tangled bloom: a balmy wave Foreran her coming, and the blushful dawn Of Love its color to the moonlight gave, And Night grew splendid. In a trance divine, Hand locked in hand, with kissing pulse, we clung, Then heart to heart; and all her being flung Its sweetness to the lips, and mixed with mine. XVI Immortal Hour, whose starry torch did guide Eternal Love to his embalmèd nest In virgin bosoms,—Hour, supremely blest Beyond thy sisters, lift thy brow in pride, And say to her whose muffled beams invest The bed where Strength lies down at Beauty's side. “Before my holier lamp thy forehead hide: Give up thy crown: the joy I bring is best!” XVII “O saved, not lost,—Madonna, bless thy child!” She murmured then; and I as fondly, “Death Come now, and close my over-happy breath On sacred lips, that shall not be defiled By grosser kisses!” “Fail me not,” she said, And clung the closer,—“God is overhead, And hears you.” “Yea,” I whispered wild, “And may His thunder strike the false one dead!” XVIII No thought had she of lineage or of place: Love washed the colors from her blazoned shield To make a mirror for her lover's face, Unto patrician ignorance revealed The bliss to give, the ecstasy to yield, And now, descended from her stately dream, She trod the happy level of her race, In perfect, sweet surrender, faith supreme. XIX With cautious feet, in dewy sandals shod, And sidelong look, the perfumed Hours went by; Until the azure darkness of the sky Withered aloft, and shameless Morning trod Her clashing bells. Our paradise was past, And yet to part was bitterer than to die. We rose: we turned: we held each other fast, Each kiss the fonder as it seemed the last. XX O happy Earth! To Love's triumphant heart Thou still art convoyed by the singing stars That hailed thy birth: Heaven's beauteous counterpart, No shadow dims thee, no convulsion mars Thy fair green bosom: on thy forehead shine The golden lilies of the bridegroom Day, Thy hoary forests take the bloom of May, Thy seas the sparkle of the autumn wine! XXI Serenely beautiful, the brightening morn Led on the march of mine enchanted round Of days, wherein the world was freshly born, And men with primal purity recrowned: So deep my drunkenness of heart and brain, That Art, o'ershadowed, sat as if forlorn In Love's excess of glory, and in vain Essayed my old allegiance to regain. XXII She to the regions o'er our lives unfurled Is turned: from that which never is, she draws Her best achievements and her finest laws, And more enriches than she owes, the world,— Whence, leading Life, she rules; till Life, in turn, Feels in its veins the warmer ether burn, Asserts itself, and bids its service pause, To be the beauty it was vowed to earn! XXIII And my transfigured heart no baby-love, With dimpled face, had taken to its nest, But that Titanic, pre-Olympian guest, The elder god, who bears his slaves above The fret of Time, the frowns of Circumstance; And, twin with Will, engendered in my breast A certain vision of a life in rest, And love secured against the shocks of chance. XXIV It was enough to feel his potent arm Lift me aloft, like giant Christopher, Above the flood. Could he the dragon charm Whose fanged and gilded strength still guarded her? The crumbling pride of twice three hundred years, Trembling in dotage at the ghost of harm, Could he subdue? Ah, wherefore summon fears To vex the faith that never reappears! XXV But she the more, whose swift-approaching fate Shamed the exulting bliss that made me free, And clouded hers, thereon did meditate. When next she met me at the garden-gate, Its chilling shadow fell upon me. “See!” She said, and dangled in the balmy dark (The moon was down) a chain of jewelry, That, snake-like, burned with many a diamond spark. XXVI “His bridal gift!” she whispered: “he will come, Erelong, to claim me. Speech, and tears, and prayer, Are vain my father's will to overbear, And better were it had my lips been dumb. Incredulous, he heard with wondering stare My pleading: ‘Keep me, father, at your side! I will not be that wanton prince's bride,— Unwed, your lonely palace let me share!’ XXVII “Much more I said, not daring to reveal Our secret; but, alas! I spoke in vain. He coldly smiled and raised me: ‘Do not kneel,— 'T is useless: here 's a pretty, childish rain For nothing, but the sun will shine anon. What ails the girl? the compact shall remain. Pandolfo's name is not so newly won, That we can smutch it, and not feel the stain.’ XXVIII “He spoke my doom; but death were sweeter now, Since, O my best-belovèd, life alone Is where your eyes, your lips, can meet my own, And Heaven commands, that registered your vow, To save me, and fulfil it!” Then, around My neck her white, imploring arms were thrown; Her heart beat in mine ears with plaintive sound, So close and piteously she held me bound. XXIX Ah me! 't was needless further to rehearse The old romance, that life has ne'er belied, The old offence which love repeats to pride,— The strife, the supplication, and the curse Hung like a thunder-cloud above the dawn, To threat the day: it better seemed, to fly Beyond the circle of that sullen sky, And storms let idly loose when we were gone. XXX “Darling,” I answered, staking all my fate On the sole chance within my beggared hands,— “Darling, the wealth of love is my estate, Save one poor home, that in a valley stands, Cool, dark, and lonesome, far beyond the line Of wintry peaks that guard the summer lands; But shelter safe, though paler suns may shine, And Paradise, when once 't is yours and mine! XXXI “See! I am all I give: I cannot ask That you should leave the laurel and the rose, And halls of yellowing marble, meant to bask In endless sun, and airs of old repose That fan the beauteous ages, elsewhere lost,— To see the world put on its deathly mask Of low, gray sky and ever-deepening snows, And dip its bowers in darkness and in frost.” XXXII “Nay, let” (she cried) “his mellow marbles shine In Roman noons,—his fountains flap the airs, And rank and splendor crowd his gilded stairs, Wait in his halls, or drink his banquet-wine,— So ne'er the hateful pomp I spurn be mine; But take me, love! for ah, the father, too, Who for his early claims my later cares, Is leagued with him,—and I am left to you!” XXXIII “So, then, shall Summer cross the Alpine chain And scare the autumn crocus from the meads; And the wan naiads, 'mid their brittle reeds, Feel the chill wave its languid pulse regain, Wooing the azure brook-flowers into bloom To greet your coming; and the golden rain Of beechen forests shall your path illume, Till the Year's bonfire burn away its gloom!” XXXIV Thus, at her words, my sudden rapture threw Its glory on the scene so bleak before, As to the nightly mariner a shore That out of hollow darkness slowly grew, Seeming huge cliffs that menaced with the roar Of hungry surf, when Morning lifts her torch Flashes at once to gardens dim with dew, And homes and temples fair with pillared porch. XXXV “Away!” was Love's command, and we obeyed; And Chance assisted, ere three times the sun Looked o'er the planet's verge, that swiftly spun To bring the hour so perilously delayed My fortune with Colonna's now was weighed; But that brief time of love's last liberty— Pandolfo called to Rome, ere aught betrayed His daughter's secret—turned the scale to me. XXXVI My mules were waiting by the city gate, With Gianni, quick to lead a lover's fate Along the bridle-paths of Apennine,— A gallant contadino, whom I knew From crown to sole, each joint and clear-drawn line Of plaited muscle, healthy, firm, and true; And midnight struck, as from the garden came She who forsook for me her home and name. XXXVII With them she laid aside her silken shell And jewel-sparks, and chains of moony pearl,— Bright, babbling toys, that of her rank might tell,— And wore, to cheat the drowsy sentinel, The scarlet bodice of a peasant-girl, Her wealth the golden dagger in her hair: The haughty vestures from her beauty fell, Leaving her woman, simply pure and fair. XXXVIII The gate was passed: before us, through the night, We traced the dusky road, and far away, Where ceased the stars, we knew the mountains lay. There must we climb before their shoulders, white With autumn rime, should redden to the day; But now a line of faintly-scattered light Plays o'er the dust, and the old olives calls To ghostly life above the orchard-walls. XXXIX A little chapel, built by pious hands, That foot-sore pilgrims from the blistering soil May turn, or laborers from summer toil To rest that breathes of God, it open stands; And there her shrine with daily flowers is dressed, Her lamp is nightly trimmed and fed with oil, The Mater Dolorosa, in whose breast, Bleeding, the seven swords of woe are pressed. XL “Stay!” whispered Clelia, as the narrow vault Yawned with its faded frescoes, and the lamp Revealed, untouched by rust or blurred with damp, The Virgin's face: it beckoned us to halt And lay our love before her feet divine, A priestless sacrament,—so kneeling there In self-bestowed espousal, Clelia's prayer Spake to the Mother's heart her trust in mine. XLI “O Sorrowing Mother! Heaven's exalted Queen! Star of the Sea! Lily among the Thorns! Clothed with the sun, while round Thy feet serene The crescent planet curves her silver horns, Be Thou my star to still this trembling sea Within my bosom,—let the love that mourns One with the love that here rejoices, be, Soothed in Thy peace, acceptable to Thee! XLII “Thou who dost hide the maiden's virgin fear In thine enclosèd garden, Fountain sealed Of Woman's holiest secrets, bend Thine ear To these weak words of one whose heart must yield This temple of the body Thou didst wear To love,—and by Thy pity, oft revealed, Pure Priestess, hearken to Thy daughter's prayer, And bless the bond, of other blessing bare! XLIII “Mother of Wisdom, in whose heart are thrust The seven swords of Sorrow, in whose pain Thy chaste Divinity draws near again To maids and mothers, crying from the dust,— Who ne'er forgettest any human woe, Once doubly Thine, Thy grace and comfort show, And perfect make, O Star above the Sea, These nuptial pledges, only heard by Thee!” XLIV Then Clelia's hand entrusted she to mine, Who knelt beside her, and the vow she spake, Weeping: “I take him, Mother, at Thy shrine. Home, country, father, leave I for his sake, Give my pure name, my maiden honor break For him, my spouse!” And I: “I give my life, Chaste, faithful to the end, to her, my wife, Whom here, O Mother, at Thy hands I take!” XLV Thus, in the lack of Earth's ordaining rite, Did our own selves our union consecrate; But God was listening from the hollow Night. Beyond the stars we felt His smile create Dawn in the doubtful twilight of our fate: Peace touched our hearts and sacredest content: The veil was lifted from our perfect light Of nuptial love, pure-burning, reverent. XLVI The Sorrowing Mother gazed. So pure the kiss I gave, Her own divinest lips had ta'en From mine no trace of sense-reflected stain; But Gianni called us from the dream of bliss. “Haste, Signor, haste!” he cried: “the Bear drops low: Soon will the cocks in all the gardens crow The morning watch: day comes, and night again, But come to part, not mate, unless you go!” XLVII Then silent, side by side, we forward fled Through the chill airs of night: each falling hoof Beat like a flail beneath the thresher's roof, In quick, unvarying time: and rosy-red Crept o'er the gray, as nimbly Gianni led Our devious flight along the barren steeps, Till, far beyond the sinking, misty deeps, The sun forsook his Adriatic bed. XLVIII There is a village perched, as you emerge From the Santerno's long and winding vale Towards Imolà, upon the cliffy verge Of the last northern prop of Apennine,— Old, yellow houses, hinting many a tale Of ducal days and Este's tragic line, And over all uplifted, orange pale Against the blue, a belfry slim and fine. XLIX With weary climbing of the rocky stair Thither we came, and in a hostel rude Sat down, outworn, to breathe securer air, Our guide dismissed, nor eyes that might intrude, Among the simple inmates of the place. The brightest stars of heaven watched o'er us there In sweet conjunction, every dread to chase, To close the Past, and make the Future fair. L Ah, had we dared to linger in that nest,— To watch from under overhanging eaves, The loaded vines, the poplars' twinkling leaves,— Afar, the breadth of the Romagna's breast And Massa's, Lugo's towers,—the little stir Of innocent life, caress and be caressed, Rank, Art, and Fame among the things that were, And all her bliss in me, as mine in her! LI But Florence was too near: my purpose held To bear and hide our happiness afar In the dark mountains, lonely, greenest-delled; And still, each night, the never-setting star We followed took in heaven a loftier stand,— Sparkled on other rivers, other towns, Glinting from icy horns and snowy crowns Until we trod the green Bavarian land! LII And evermore, behind us on the road, Pursuit, a phantom, drove. If we delayed, Some coward pulse our meeting bosoms frayed; Our tale the breezes blew, the sunshine glowed; The stars our secret ecstasies betrayed: Drunk with our passion's vintage, we must fill The cup too full, and tremble lest it spill,— Obeying, thus, the law we would evade. LIII Now, from that finer ether sinking down Into the humble, universal air, The images of many a human care That, wren-like, build beneath the thatch of love, Came round us. O'er the watery levels, brown With autumn stubble, the departing dove Cooed her farewell to summer: rainy-cold Through rocky gates the yellow Danube rolled. LIV Grim were the mountains, with their dripping pines Planted in sodden moss, and swiftly o'er Their crests the clouds their flying fleeces tore: The herd-boy, from his lair of furze and vines Peered out, beside his dogs; and forms uncouth, The axemen, from the steeps descending, wore The strength of manhood, but its grace no more,— The lust, without the loveliness, of youth! LV The swollen streams careered beside us, hoarse As warning prophets in an evil age, And through the stormy fastnesses our course, Blown, buffeted with elemental rage, Fell, with the falling night, to that lone vale I pictured, with its meads of crocus-bloom,— Ah me, engulfed and lost in drowning gloom, The helpless sport and shipwreck of the gale! LVI Where now the bright autumnal bonfires? Where The gold of beechen woods, the prodigal And dazzling waste of color in its fall? The brook-flowers, bluer than the morning-air? “My pomp of welcome mocked you, love!” I sighed: “The sign was false, the flattering dream denied: Unkind is Nature, yet all skies are fair To trusting hearts, when once their truth is tried!” LVII But Clelia shuddered, clinging to my heart When the low roof received us, and the sound Of threshing branches boomed and whistled round Our cot, that stood a little way apart Against the forest, from the village strayed, Where cunning workmen in their prisons bound The roaring Fiend of Fire, and forced his aid To mould the crystal wonders of their trade. LVIII Poor was our home, and when the rainy sky Brought forth a child of Night, an Ethiop day, And still the turbid torrents thundered by, From the drear landscape she would turn away,— Her thoughts, perchance, where gilded Florence lay,— To hide a tear, or crush a rising sigh, Then sing the sweet Italian songs, where run Twin rills of words and music into one. LIX I, too, beneath the low-hung rafters saw In dusk that filtered through the narrow panes, My palette spread with colors dull and raw, Once ripe and juicy-fresh as blossom-stains. The dim, beclouded season never brought The light that flatters; but its mists and rains Like eating rust upon my canvas wrought, And turned to substance cold the tinted thought. LX Around me moved a rough and simple race Whose natures, fresh and uncontaminate, Gave truth to life, and smoothed their toilful fate With honesty and love—but lacked the grace Of strength allied to beauty, or the free Unconscious charm of Southern symmetry, And motions measured by a rhythm elate And joyous as the cadence of the sea. LXI For if, at times, among the slaves who fed The ever-burning kilns, in fiercest glow Some naked torso momently would show Like Hell's strong angel, dipped in lurid red, No model this for Saviour, seraph, saint, Ensphered in golden ether: Labor's taint Defaced the form, and here 't were vain, I said, Some lovely hint to find, and finding, paint! LXII Ah, Art and Love! Immortal brother-gods, That will not dwell together, nor apart, But make your temple in your servant's heart A house of battle. One his forehead nods In drowsy bliss, and will not be disturbed, The other's eager forces work uncurbed, Yet most in each the other lives; and each Mounts by the other's help his crown to reach. LXIII To Love my debt was greatest: I compelled Back to their sleep the dreams that stung in vain, And folded Clelia in a love which held The heart all fire, although its flame was nursed By embers borrowed from the smouldering brain. For her had Art aspired; but now, reversed The duty, Art for her must abnegate Its restless, proud resolves, and idly wait. LXIV The rains had whitened in the upper air, And left their chill memorials glittering now On Arber's shoulders, Ossa's hornèd brow; The summer forest of its gold was bare; Loud o'er the changeless pines November drove His frosty steeds, through narrowing days that wear No light; and Winter settled from above, White, heavy, cold, around our nest of love. LXV The sportive fantasies of wind and snow, The corniced billows which they love to pile, The ermined woods, with boughs depending low, To buttress frozenly each darksome aisle, The spectral hills which twilight veils in dun, The season's hushing sounds,—my Clelia won From haunting memories, and stayed awhile Her homesick pining for the Tuscan sun. LXVI Only, when after briefest day, the moon Poured down an icy light, and all around Came from the iron woods a crackling sound, As from the stealthy steps of Cold, and soon The long-drawn howl of famished wolf was heard Far in the mountains, like a shuddering bird Beside my heart a nestling place she found, And smiled to hear my fond, assuring word. LXVII So drifted on, till Death's white shadow passed From edgèd air and stony earth, our fate: Then from the milder cloud and loosening blast Unto his sunnier nooks returning late, Came Life, and let his flowery footprint stand. Softer than wing of dove, the winds at last Kissed where they smote; the skies were blue and bland, And in their lap reposed the ravished land. LXVIII Then tears of gummy crystal wept the pine, And like a phantom plume, the sea-green larch Was dropped along the mountain's lifted arch, And morning on the meadows seemed to shine, All day, in blossoms: cuckoo-songs were sweet, And sweet the pastoral music of the kine Chiming a thousand bells aloft, to meet The herdsman's horn, the young lamb's wandering bleat! LXIX Under the forest's sombre eaves there slept No darkness, but a balsam-breathing shade, Rained through with light: the hurrying waters made Music amid the solitude, and swept Their noise of liquid laughter from afar, Through smells of sprouting leaf and trampled grass, And thousand tints of flowery bell and star, To sing the year's one idyl ere it pass! LXX And down the happy valleys wandered we, Released and glad, the children of the sun,— I by adoption and by nature she,— And still our love a riper color won From the strong god in whom all colors burn. The Earth regained her ancient alchemy To cheat our souls with dreams of what might be, And never is,—yet, wherefore these unlearn? LXXI For they reclothe us with a mantle, lent From the bright wardrobe of the Gods: the powers, The glories of the Possible are ours: We breathe the pure, sustaining element Above the dust of life,—steal fresh content From distant gleams of never-gathered flowers— Believing, rise: our very failures wear Immortal grace from what we vainly dare! LXXII From dreams like these is shaped the splendid act In painters', poets' brains: we let them grow, And as the season rolled in richer flow To summer, from their waves a wondrous fact Uprose, and shamed them with diviner glow,— A tremulous secret, mystic, scarce-confessed, That, star-like, throbs within the coarsest breast, And sets God's joy beside His creature's woe. LXXIII As one may see, along some April rill, By richest mould and softest dew-fall fed, The daybreak blossom of a daffodil Send from its heart a tenderer blossom still, Flower bearing flower, so fair a marvel shed Its bliss on Clelia's being; and she smiled With those prophetic raptures which fulfil The mother's nature ere she clasps her child. LXXIV Between our hearts, embracing both, there stole A silent Presence, like to that which reigns In Heaven, when God another world ordains. Here, in its genesis, a formless soul Waited the living garment it should wear Of holiest flesh, though ours were dark with stains,— Yet clouds that blot the blue, eternal air, Upon their folds the rainbow's beauty bear! LXXV And none of all the folk we moved among In that lone valley, whether man or maid, Or weary woman, prematurely wrung To bear the lusty flock that round her played, But spake to Clelia in a gentler tongue And unto her their timid reverence paid, As, in her life repeated, one might see Madonna's pure maternal sanctity! LXXVI All knew the lady, beautiful and tall,— Dark, yet so pale in her strange loveliness, Whom oft they saw with gliding footstep press The meads, the forest's golden floor; and all Knew the enchanted voice, whose alien song Silenced the mountains, till the wood-man lone His axe let fall, and dreamed and listened long,— The key-flower plucked, the fairy gold his own! LXXVII Never, they said, did year its bounty shower So plenteously upon their fields, as now. The lady brought their fortune: many a vow Would rise to help her in her woman's hour Of pain and joy, and what their hands could do (The will was boundless, though so mean the power) Was hers,—their queen, the fairest thing they knew Within the circle of the mountains blue. LXXVIII And Autumn came, like him from Edom, him With garments dyed, from Bozrah, glorious In his apparel; yet his gold was dim, His crimsons pale, beside the splendors warm Wherewith the ripened time transfigured us. The precious atoms drawn from heaven and earth, And rocked by Love's own music into form, Compacted lived: a soul awaited birth. LXXIX A soul was born. The hazy-mantled sun Looked in on Clelia, radiant as a saint Who triumphs over torture, pale and faint From parted life,—and kissed the life begun With tender light, as quick to recognize His child, in exile: the unconscious one,— Stray lamb of heaven, whom tears might best baptize,— Closed on her happy breast his mother's eyes. LXXX Her eyes they were: her fresh-born beauty took Its seat in man, that woman's heart might bow One day, before the magic of that look Which conquered man and held him captive now. The frail and precious mould which drew from me Naught but its sex, her likeness did endow With breathing grace and witching symmetry, As once in baby demigod might be. LXXXI So came from him—as in Correggio's “Night” The body of the Holy Child illumes The stable dark, the starry Syrian glooms, The rapt, adoring faces,—sudden light For that dark season when the sun hung low; And warmth, when earth again lay cold and white; And peace, Love reconciled with Life to know; And promise, kindling Art to rosier glow. LXXXII Here dawned the inspiration, long delayed, The light of loftier fancy. As she pressed, Cradled against her balmy mother-breast, The child—a pink on sun-kissed lilies laid— I saw the type of old achievement won In them, the holy hint their forms conveyed: And lovelier never God's Elected Maid And Goddess-Mother dreamed Urbino's son! LXXXIII But she—when first mine eager hand would seize Her perfect beauty—troubled grew, and pale. “Dear Egon, No!” she said: “my heart would fail, Alarmed for love that wraps in sanctities Its earthly form: for see! the babe may lie With white, untainted soul, and in his eye The light of Heaven, and pure as almond-flowers His dimpling flesh,—but, Egon, he is ours! LXXXIV “If blessing may be forfeited, to set A child, the loveliest, in the place divine Of Infant God, it were more impious yet To veil the Mother's countenance in mine: Ah, how should I, to human love though fair, Assume her grace and with her pity shine,— Profane usurpress of her sacred shrine, To cheat the vow and intercept the prayer!” LXXXV A woman's causeless fancy! What I said I scarce remember,—that the face I stole Had brought herself, and if the half so wrought, A surer blessing now must bring the whole, And laurel cast, not jasmine, on my head. The profanation was a thing of thought, Or touched the artist only: who could paint, If saint alone dare model be for saint? LXXXVI And so, by Art possessed, I would not see Forebodings which in woman's finer sense Arise, and draw their own fulfilment thence,— Light clouds, yet hide the bolts of Destiny And darken life, erelong. I gave, in joy, To fleeting grace immortal permanence, And dreamed of coming fame for all the three, Myself, the fairest mother, and the boy! LXXXVII She sat, in crimson robe and mantle blue, Fondling the child in holy nakedness, Resigned and calm,—alas! I could not guess The haunting fear that daily deeper grew In the sweet face that would its fear subdue, Nor make my hand's creative rapture less: But cold her kisses to my own replied, And when the work completed stood—she sighed. LXXXVIII And from that hour a shadow seemed to hang Around her life: our idyl breathed no more Its flute-like joy in every strain she sang: Her step the measures of an anthem wore, That hushes, soothes, yet makes not wholly sad; And if, at times, my heart confessed a pang To note the haunted gleam her features had, I failed to read the prophecy it bore. LXXXIX Again the summer beckoned from the hills, And back from Daulis came the nightingale; But when the willows shook by meadow-rills Their sheeted silver, Clelia's cheek grew pale. She spoke not; but I knew her fancy said: So shook the olives now in Arno's vale, So flashed the brook along its pebbly bed, Through bosky oleanders, roofed with red! XC This cheer I gave: “Be sure my fame awaits The work of love: this cloud will break, and we Walk in the golden airs of Tuscany, Guarded by that renown which consecrates Our fault, if love be such; and fame shall be My shield, to shame your father's heraldry, And set you in your ancient halls. Take heart, And as my love you trusted, trust my art!” XCI She faintly smiled,—if smile the lips could stir Which more of yearning than of hope expressed; A filmy mask to hide the warning guest Of thought which evermore abode in her: And then she kissed me,—not, as once with fire And lingering sweetness drawn from love's desire, But soft, as Heaven's angelic messenger Might touch the lips of prayer, and make them blest! BOOK III THE CHILD I Sad Son of Earth, if ever to thy care Some god entrust the dazzling gift of joy, Within thy trembling hands the burden bear As if the frailest crystal shell it were, One thrill of exultation might destroy! Look to thy feet, take heed where thou shalt stand, And arm thine eyes with fear, thy heart with prayer, Like one who travels in a hostile land! II For, ever hovering in the heart of day Unseen, above thee wait the Powers malign, Who scent thy bliss as vultures scent decay: Unveil thy secret, give one gladsome sign, Send up one thought to chant beside the lark In airy poise, and lo! the sky is dark With swooping wings,—thy gift is snatched away Ere dies the rapture which proclaimed it thine! III We plan the houses which are never built: The volumes which our precious thoughts enclose Are never written: in the falchion's hilt Sleeps nobler daring than the hero shows: And never Fate allows a life to give The measure of a soul,—but incomplete Expression and imperfect action meet, To form the tintless sketch of what we live. IV I would not see the path that led apart My Clelia's feet, as 't were on hills of cloud, But deemed the saintlier light, whereto I bowed In reverence of mine adoring heart, The mother's nature: day by day I smiled, As higher, further drawn, my dreams avowed Diviner types of beauty,—whence beguiled, Her robes of heaven I wrapped around her child. V Our daily miracle was he: a bud Steeped in the scents of Eden, balmy fair, The world's pure morning bright upon his hair, And life's unopened roses in his blood! In the blank eyes of birth a timorous star Of wonder sparkled, as the soul awoke, And from his tongue a brook-like babbling broke,— A strange, melodious language from afar! VI His body showed, in every dimpled swell, The pink and pearl of Ocean's loveliest shell, And swift the little pulses throbbed along Their turquoise paths, the soft breast rose and fell As to the music of a dancing song, And all the darling graces which belong To babyhood, and breathe from every limb, Made life more beautiful, revealed in him. VII His mother's face I dared not paint again, For now, infected by her mystic dread, The picture smote me with reproachful pain; But often, bending o'er his cradle-bed To learn by heart the wondrous tints and lines That charmed me so, my kindling fancy said: “By thee, my Cherub, shall mine art be led To clasp the Truth it now but half divines! VIII “If I have sinned, to set thee in the place Of Infant God, the hand that here offends Shall owe its cunning to thy growing grace, And from thy loveliness make late amends. Six summers more, and I shall bid thee stand Before me, with uplift, prophetic face, And there St. John shall grow beneath my hand,— A bright boy-angel in a desert land! IX “Six summers more, and then, as Ganymede's, Thy rosy limbs against the dark-blue sky Shall press the eagle's plumage as he speeds; Or darling Hylas, 'mid Scamander's reeds, Borrow thy beauty: six again, and I Shall from thy lithesome adolescence take My young St. George, my victor knight, and make Beneath thy sword once more the Dragon die! X “Art thou not mine? and wilt thou not repay My love with help unconsciously bestowed? In thy fresh being, in its bright abode, Shall I not find my morning-star, my day? Rejoice! one life, at least, shall deathless be,— One perfect form grow ripe, but not decay: Through mine own blood shall I my triumph see, And give to glory what I steal from thee!” XI One day, in indolence of sheer despair, I sat with hanging arm, the colors dried Upon my palette: sudden, at my side Knelt Clelia, lifting through her falling hair A look that stabbed me with its tearful care; And words that came like swiftly-dropping tears Made my heart ache and shiver in mine ears, As thus in sorrow and in love she cried: XII “O Egon, mine the fault! I should have dared Defy the compact,—should have set you, love, As far in station as in soul above These mocking wants—mine idle fortune shared With your achievement! Coward heart, that fled The post of righteous battle, and prepared For you, whose hand and brain I could not wed, Meaning to bless, a martyrdom instead! XIII “I hold you back, alas! when you aspire; I chain your spirit when it pants to soar: I, proud to kindle, glad to feed the fire, But heap cold ashes on its fading core! Command me, Egon! shall I seek the sire Whose lonely house might welcome me once more, And mine—my twain belovèd? Let me make This late, last trial for our future's sake!” XIV “Not thine, my Clelia!” soothing her, I said, “Not thine the fault—nor ours; but Demons wait To thwart the shining purposes of Fate, And not a crown descends on any head Ere half its fairest leaves are plucked or dead: Yet be it as thou wilt,—who bore thee thence Must in thy father's house thee reinstate, Or bear—not thou—the weight of his offence. XV “Come, thou art pale, and sad, and sick for home, My summer lilly—nursling of the sun! But thou shalt blossom in the breeze of Rome, And dip thy feet in Baiæ's whispering foam, And in the torn Abruzzi valleys, dun With August stubble, watch thy wild fawn run,— I swear it! With the melting of the snow, If Fortune or if Ruin guide, we go!” XVI And soon there came, as 't were an answering hint From heaven, the tardy gold Madonna brought,— But I unto that end had gladly wrought Heart's-blood to coin, and drained the ruddy mint Of life, again the mellow songs to hear That told how sunward turned her happy thought: That sang to sleep her soul's unbodied fear, And led her through the darkness of the year! XVII Alas! 't was not so written. Day by day Her cheek grew thin, her footstep faint and slow; And yet so fondly, with such hopeful play Her pulses beat, they masked the coming woe. Joy dwelt with her, and in her eager breath His cymbals drowned the hollow drums of Death: Life showered its promise, surer to betray, And the false Future crumbled fast away. XVIII Aye, she was happy! God be thanked for this, That she was happy!—happier than she knew, Had even the hope that cheated her been true; For from her face there beamed such wondrous bliss, As cannot find fulfilment here, and dies. God's peace and pardon touched me in her kiss, Heaven's morning dawned and brightened in her eyes, And o'er the Tuscan arched remoter skies! XIX Dazzled with light, I could not see the close So near and dark, and every day that won Some warmer life from the returning sun, Took from the menaces that interpose Between the plan and deed. I dared to dream Her dreams, and paint them lovelier as they rose, Till from the echoing hollows one wild stream Sprang to proclaim the melting of the snows. XX Then—how she smiled! And I the casement wide To that triumphant sound must throw, despite The bitter air; and, soothed and satisfied, She slept until the middle watch of night. I watched beside her: dim the taper's light Before the corner-shrine,—the walls in shade Glimmered, but through the window all was white In crystal moonshine, and the winds were laid. XXI And awe and shuddering fell upon my soul. Out of the silence came, if not a sound, The sense of sphery music, far, profound, As Earth, revolving on her moveless pole, Might breathe to God: and at the casement shone Something—a radiant bird it seemed,—alone, And beautiful, and strange: its plumes around Played the soft fire of stars whence it had flown. XXII The beak of light, the eye of flame,—dispread The hovering wings, as winnowing music out; And richer still the glory grew about The shadowy room, crept over Clelia's bed And hung, a shimmering circle, round her head: Then marked I that her eyes were wide and clear, Nor wondered at the vision. All my fear Fled when she spoke, and these the words she said: XXIII “Thou call'st, and I am ready. Ah, I see The shining field of lilies in the moon, So white, so fair! Yet how depart with thee, And leave the bliss of threefold life so soon? Peace, fainting heart! Though sweet it were to stay, Sweet messenger, thy summons I obey: And now the mountains part, and now the free Wide ocean gleams beneath a golden day! XXIV “How still they lie, the olive-sandalled slopes, The gardens and the towers! But floating o'er Their shaded sleep, lo! some diviner shore, Deep down the bright, unmeasured distance, opes Its breathing valleys: wait for me! I haste, But am not free: till morning let me taste The last regret of faithful love once more. Then shall I walk with thee yon lilied floor!” XXV The bright Thing fled, the moon went down the west. Long lay she silent, sleepless; nor might I Break with a sound the hush of ecstasy, The strange, unearthly peace, till from his rest The child awoke with soft, imploring cry: Then she, with feeble hands outreaching, laid His little cheek to hers, and softly made His murmurs cease upon her mother-breast. XXVI My trance dissolved at once, and falling prone In agony of tears, as falls a wave With choked susurrus in some hollow cave, Brake forth my life's lament and bitter moan. I shook with passionate grief: I murmured: “Stay! Have I not sworn to give thee back thine own? False was the token, false!” She answered: “Nay, It says, Farewell! and yonder dawns the day.” XXVII No more! I said farewell: withdrawn afar, Still faintly came to me, its clasping shore, When morning drowned the wintry morning-star, Her ebbing life; then paused—and came no more! And blue the mocking sky, and loud the roar Of loosened waters, leaping down the glen: The songs of children and the shouts of men Flouted the awful Shadow at my door! XXVIII And chill my heart became, a sepulchre Sealed with the sudden ice of frozen tears: I sat in stony calm, and looked at her, Flown in the brightness of her beauteous years, And not a pulse with conscious sorrow beat; Nor, when they robed her in her winding-sheet, Did any pang my silent bosom stir, But pain, like bliss, seemed of the things that were. XXIX With cold and changeless face beside her grave I stood, and coldly heard the shuddering sound Of coffin echoes, smothered underground: The tints I marked, the mournful mountains gave,— Faces and garments of the throngs around,— The sexton's knotted hands, the light and shade That strangely through the moving colors played,— So, feeling dead, Art's habit held me bound! XXX Yet, very slowly, Feeling's self was born Of chance forgetfulness: when meadows took A greener hem along the winding brook, And buds were balmy in the fresh May-morn, Oft would I turn, as though her step to wait; Or ask the songless echoes why so late Her song delayed; or from my lonely bed At midnight start, and weep to find her fled! XXXI And with the pains of healing came a care For him, her child: she had not wholly died; And what of her lost being he might wear Was doubly mine through all the years untried, To love, and give me love. Him would I bear Beyond the Alps, forth from this fatal zone, To make his mother's land and speech his own, And keep her beauty at his father's side! XXXII So forth we fared: the faithful peasant nurse Who guarded now his life, should guard it still. We hastened on: there seemed a brooding curse Upon the valley. Many a brawling rill We left behind, and many a darksome hill, Long fens, and clay-white rivers of the plain, Then mountains clad in thunder,—and again Soared the high Alps, and sparkled, white and chill. XXXIII To seek some quiet, southward-opening vale Beside the Adige, was my first design; And sweetly hailed along the Brenner's line With songs of Tyrol, welcomed by the gale That floated from the musky slopes of vine, With summer on its wings, I wandered down To fix our home in some delightful town,— But when the first we reached, there came a sign. XXXIV The bells were tolling,—not with nuptial joy, But heavily, sadly: down the winding street The pattering tumult came of children's feet, Followed by men who bore a snow-pale boy Upon a flowery bier. The sunshine clung, Caressing brow and cheek,—he was so young Even Nature felt her darling's loss,—and sweet The burial hymn by childish mourners sung. XXXV “He must not see the dead!” Thus unto me The nurse, and muffled him with trembling hand. But something touched, in that sad harmony, The infant's soul: he struggled and was free A moment, saw the dead, nor could withstand The strange desire that hungered in his eye, And stretched his little arms, and made a cry,— While she, in foolish terror, turned to me: XXXVI “Now, God have mercy, master! rest not here, Or he will die!” 'T was but the causeless whim Of ignorance, and yet, a formless fear O'ercame my heart, and darkly menaced him As with his mother's fond, foreboding dread: Then wild with haste to lift the shadow dim Which seemed already settling round his head, That hour we left, and ever southward sped. XXXVII Past wondrous mountains, peaked with obelisks, With pyramids and domes of dolomite That burned vermilion in the dying light,— Crags where the hunter with a thousand risks The steinbok follows,—world of strength and song Under the stars, among the fields of white, While deep below, the broad vale winds along Through corn and wine, secure from winter's wrong! XXXVIII My plan complete, the foolish servitress Back to her dark Bohemian home I sent, And gave my boy to one whose gentleness Fell gentlier from her Tuscan tongue. We went By lonely roads, where over Garda's lake Their brows the cloven-hearted mountains bent, To lands divine, where Como's waters make Twin arms, to clasp them for their beauty's sake! XXXIX There ceased my wanderings, finding what I sought: The charms of water, earth, and air allied,— Secluded homes, with prospects free and wide Around a princely world, which thither brought Only the aspect of its holiday, And made its emulous, unsleeping pride Put on the yoke of Nature, and obey Her mood of ornament, her summer play. XL The shapely hills, whose summits towered remote In rosy air, might smile in soft disdain Of palaces that strung a jewelled chain About their feet, and far-off, seemed to float On violet-misted waters; yet they wore Their groves and gardens like a festal train, And in the mirror of the crystal plain Steep vied with steep, shore emulated shore! XLI Above Bellagio, on the ridge that leans To meet, on either side, the parted blue There is a cottage, which the olive screens From sight of those who come the pomp to view Of Villa Serbelloni: thrust apart Beside a quarry whence the pile they drew,— A home for simple needs and straitened means, For lonely labor and a brooding heart. XLII Too young was I, too filled with blood and fire, To clothe myself with ultimate despair. Drinking with eager breast that idle air, Color with eyes new-bathed, that could not tire, And stung by form, and wooed by moving grace, And warmed with beauty, should I not aspire My misty dreams with substance to replace, Nor ghosts beget, but an immortal race? XLIII Yea! rather close, as in a sainted shrine, My life's most lovely, tender episode, Renounce the ordination it bestowed, And only taste its sacramental wine In those brief Sabbaths, when the heart demands Solemn repose and sustenance divine! Yet lives the Artist in these restless hands, And waiting, here, the rich material stands! XLIV Had I not sought, I asked myself, the far Result, and haughtily disdained the source? From myriad threads hangs many-stranded Force,— Compact of gloomy atoms, burns the star! Of earth are all foundations; and of old On mounds of clay were lifted to their place Shafts of eternal temples. We behold The noble end, whereto no means are base. XLV I loved my work; and therefore vowed to love All subjects, finding Art in everything,— The angel's plumage in the bird's plain wing,— Until such time as I might rise above The conquered matter, to the power supreme Which takes, rejects, adorns,—a rightful king, Whose hand completes the subtly-hinted scheme, And blends in equal truth the Fact and Dream! XLVI And now commenced a second life, wherein Myself and Agatha and Angelo Beheld the lonely seasons come and go, Contented,—whether gray with hoar-frost thin The aloes stiffened, or the passion-flower Enriched the summer heats, or autumn shower Rejoiced the yellow fig-leaves wide to blow:— So still that life, we scarcely felt its flow. XLVII How guileless, sweet, the infancy he knew, Loved for his own and for his mother's sake! How fresh in sunny loveliness he grew, Fanned by the breezes of the Larian lake. My little Angelo, my baby-friend. My boy, my blessing!—while for him I drew A thousand futures, brightening to the end; Long paths of light, with ne'er a cloudy break. XLVIII For, lisping in a sweeter tongue than mine, 'T was his delight around the spot to play Where fast I wrought in unillusive day,— Where he might chase from rock or rustling vine The golden lizard; seek the mellow peach, Wind-shaken; or, where spread the branchy pine His coverture of woven shade and shine, Sleep, lulled by murmurs of the pebbly beach. XLIX Along San Primo's chestnut-shaded sides, Through fields of thyme and spiky lavender And yellow broom, wherein the she goat hides Her yeanling kid, and wild bees ever stir The drifted blossoms,—high and breezy downs,— I led his steps, and watched his young eye glance In brightening wonder o'er the full expanse Of mountain, lake, and lake-reflected towns! L Or, crossing to the lofty Leccan shore, I bade him see the Fiume-latte leap Through shivered rainbows down the hollow steep, A meteor of the morning; high and hoar The Alp that fed it leaned against the blue,— But siren-voices chanted in the roar, Enticing, mocking: shudderingly he drew Back from the shifting whirls of endless dew. LI 'T was otherwise, when borne in dancing bark Across the wave, where Sommariva's walls Flash from the starred magnolia's breathing dark, High o'er its terraced roses, fountain-falls And bosky laurels. In that garden he Chirruped and fluttered like a callow lark, With dim fore-feeling of the azure free, Sustaining wing and strength of songful glee! LII No thing that I might paint,—a sunset cloud, A rosy islet of the amber sky,— A lily-branch,—the azure-emerald dye Of neck and crest that makes the peacock proud,— Or plume of fern, or berried ivy-braid, Or sheen of sliding waters,—e'er could vie With the least loveliness his form conveyed In outline, motion, daintiest light and shade. LIII Not yet would I indulge the rapturous task, The crown of labor; though my weary brain Ached from the mimicry of Nature's mask, And yearned for human themes. It was in vain, My vow, that patient bondage to sustain: Some unsubdued desire began to ask: “How shall these soulless images be warmed? Or Life be learned from matter uninformed?” LIV “Then Life!” I said: “but cautiously and slow,— Pure human types, that, from the common base By due degrees the spirit find its place, And climb to passion and supernal glow Of Heaven's beatitude. The level track Once let me tread, nor need to stoop so low Beneath my dreams, and thus their hope efface,— But late, in nobler guise, receive them back.” LV So, venturing no further, I began The work I craved, and only what I found In limber child, or steely-sinewed man, Or supple maiden, drew: within that bound Such excellence I saw, as told how much, Despising truth, I strayed: with reverent touch God's architecture did my pencil trace In joint and limb, as in the godlike face. LVI Each part expressed its nicely-measured share In the mysterious being of the whole: Not from the eye or lip looked forth the soul, But made her habitation everywhere Within the bounds of flesh; and Art might steal, As once, of old, her purest triumphs there. Go see the headless Ilionëus kneel, And thou the torso's agony shalt feel! LVII The blameless spirit of a lofty aim Sees not a line that asks to be concealed By dexterous evasion; but, revealed As truth demands, doth Nature smite with shame Them, who with artifice of ivy-leaf Unsex the splendid loins, or shrink the frame From life's pure honesty, as shrinks a thief, While stands a hero ignorant of blame! LVIII What joy it was, from dead material forms, Opaque, one-featured, and unchangeable, To turn, and track the shifting life that warms The shape of Man!—within whose texture dwell Uncounted lines of beauty, tints unguessed On luminous height, in softly-shaded dell, And myriad postures, moving or at rest,— All phases fair, and each, in turn, the best! LIX The rich ideal promise these convey, Which in the forms of Earth can never live. Each plastic soul has yet the power to give A separate model to its subject clay, And finely works its cunning likeness out: To men a block, to me a statue lay In each, distinct in being, draped about With mystery, touched with Beauty's random ray! LX Now Fame approached, when I expected least Her noisy greeting: 't was the olden tale. Half-scornfully I gave; yet men increased Their golden worth, the more I felt them fail, My painful counterfeits of lifeless things. “Behold!” they cried: “this wondrous artist brings Each leaf and vein of meadow-blossoms pale, The agate's streaks, the meal of mothy wings!” LXI And truly, o'er a wayside-weed they raised A sound of marvel, found in lichenrust Of ancient stones a glory, stood amazed To view a melon, gray with summer dust, And so these rudimental labors praised, The Tempter whispered to my flattered ear: “Why seek the unattained,—thy fame is here!” “Avaunt!” I cried: “in mine own soul I trust!” LXII A little while, I thought, and I shall know The stamp and sentence of my destiny,— The fateful crisis, whence my life shall be A power, a triumph, an immortal show, A kindling inspiration: or be classed (As many a noble brother in the Past) Pictor Ignotus: as it happens, so Shall turn the fortunes of my Angelo! LXIII For in his childish life, expanding now, The spirit dawned which must his future guide,— The little prattler, with his open brow, His clear, dark eye, his mouth too sweet for pride, Too proud for infancy! “My boy, decide.” I said: “wilt painter be? or rather lord Over a marble house, a steed and sword?” His visage flashed: he paused not, but replied: LXIV “Give me a marble house, as white and tall As Sommariva's! Give me horse and hound, A golden sword, and servants in the hall, And thou and I be masters over all, My father!” In that hope a joy he found, And oft in freaks of fancied lordship made The splendors his: ah, boy! thy wish betrayed The blood that beats to rise, and dare not fall. LXV Did Clelia's spirit yearn, what time she bore The unborn burden, for her lost estate? Home-sick and pining, lorn and desolate Except for love, did she, in thought, count o'er The graceful charms of that luxurious nest Wherefrom I stole her? Then was I unblest, Save he inherited her pilfered fate, And trod, for her, Pandolfo's palace-floor. LXVI The current of my dreams, directed thus, Flowed ever swifter, evermore to him. Along the coves where stripling boatmen swim I watched him oft, like Morn's young Genius, Dropped from her rose-cloud on the silver sand, Her rosy breath upon each ivory limb Kissed by the clasping waters, green and dim, And craved the hour when he should bless my hand. LXVII The seasons came and went. In sun or frost Twinkled the olive, shook the aspen bough: In winter whiteness shone Legnone's brow, Or cooled his fiery rocks in skyey blue When o'er the ruffled lake the breva tossed The struggling barks: their cups of snow and dew The dark magnolias held, and purpling poured The trampled blood from many a vineyard's hoard. LXVIII Five years had passed, and now the time was nigh When on the fond result my hand must stake Its cunning,—when the slowly-tutored eye Must lend the heart its discipline, to make Secure the throbbing hope, to which elate, My long ambition clung: and, with a sigh, “If foiled,” I said, “let silence consecrate My noteless name, and hide my ruined fate!” LXIX It was an autumn morn, when I addressed Myself unto the work. A violet haze Subdued the ardor of the golden days: A glassy solitude was Como's breast: Far, far away, from out the fading maze Of mountains, blew the flickering sound of bells: The earth lay hushed as in a Sabbath rest, And from the air came voiceless, sweet farewells! LXX My choicest colors, on the palette spread, Provoked the appetite: the canvas clear Wooed from the easel: o'er his noble head The faint light fell: his perfect body shed A sunny whiteness on the atmosphere,— All aspects gladsomely invited: yet Across my heart there swept a wave of dread,— The first lines trembled which my crayon set. LXXI The background, lightly sketched, revealed a wild Storm-shadowed sweep of Ammon's desert hills, Whose naked porphyry no dew-fed rills Touched with descending green, but rent and piled As thunder-split: behind them, glimmering low, The falling sky disclosed a lurid bar: In front, a rocky platform, where, a star Of lonely life, I meant his form should glow. LXXII The God-selected child, there should he stand, Alone and rapt, as from the world withdrawn To seek, amid the desolated land, His Father's counsel: in one tender hand A cross of reed, to lightly rest upon, The other hand a scrolled phylactery Should, hanging, hold,—as it the seed might be Wherefrom the living Gospel shall expand. LXXIII A simple theme: why, therefore, should my faith In mine own skill forsake me? why should seem His beauteous presence strangely like a dream,— His shining form an unsubstantial wraith? Was it the mother's warning, thus impressed To stay my hand, or, working in my breast, That dim, dread Power, that monitor supreme, Whose mystic ways and works no Scripture saith? LXXIV I dropped the brush, and, to assure my heart, Now vanquished quite, with quick, impassioned start Caught up the boy, and kissed him o'er and o'er,— Cheek, bosom, limbs,—and felt his pulses beat Secure existence, till my dread, dispelled, Became a thing to smile at: then, once more My hand regained its craft, and followed fleet The living lines my filmless eyes beheld. LXXV And won those lines, and tracked the subtle play Where cold, keen light, without a boundary, Through warmth, lapsed into shadow's mystic gray, And other light within that shadow lay, A maze of beauty,—till, outwearied, he With drooping eyelid stood and tottering knee; While I, withdrawn to gaze, with eager lip Murmured my joy in mine own workmanship. LXXVI I clothed his limbs again, and led him out To welcome sunshine and his glad reward, A scarlet belt, a tiny, gilded sword,— And long our bark, the sleeping shores about Sped as we willed, that happy afternoon: And sweet the evening promise (ah! too soon It came,) of what the morrow should afford,— An equal service and an equal boon! LXXVII But on the pier a messenger I found From Milan, where the borrowed name I bore Was known, he said, and more than half-renowned, And now a bright occasion offered me A fairer crown than yet my forehead wore,— A range of palace-chambers to adorn With sportive frescoes, nymphs of Earth and Sea, Pursuing Hours, and marches of the Morn! LXXVIII It steads not now that journey to repeat, Which flattered, toyed, but nothing sure bestowed. When four unrestful days were sped, my feet, With yearning shod, retraced the homeward road, With each glad minute nearing our retreat,— Mine eyes, when far away Bellagio showed Beyond Tremezzo, straining to explore Some speck of welcome on the distant shore. LXXIX Then came the town, the vineyards and the hill, The cottage: soft the orange sunset shone Upon its walls,—but everything was still, So still and strange, my heart might well disown The startled sense that gazed: the door ajar,— The chambers vacant,—ashes on the stone Where lit his torch my shy, protecting Lar,— Dark, empty, lifeless all: I stood alone! LXXX As one who in an ancient forest walks In awful midnight, when the moon is dim, And knows not What behind, or near him, stalks, And fears the rustling leaf, the snapping limb, And cannot cry, and scarce can breathe, so great The nameless Terror,—thus I sought for him, Yet feared to find him, lest the darkest fate Should touch my life and leave it desolate! LXXXI The search was vain: they both had disappeared, My boy and Agatha, nor missed I aught Of food, or gold, or pictures. Had she sought, The nurse, a livelier home, and loved or feared Too much, to leave him? Or some enemy, Fell and implacable, this ruin brought,— This thunder-stroke? No answer could I see, Nor prop whereon to rest my anguished thought. LXXXII As casts away a drowning man his gold, I cast the Artist from my life, and forth, A Father only, wandered: south or north I knew not, save the heart within me hold Love's faithful needle, ever towards him drawn, Felt and obeyed without the conscious will: And first, by nestling town and purple hill, To Garda's lake I swiftly hastened on. LXXXIII And thence a new, mysterious impulse led My steps along the Adige, day by day, To seek that village where we saw the dead,— A fantasy wherein some madness lay; For years had passed, and he a babe so young That each impression with its object fled: Not so with mine,—my roused forebodings flung That scene to light, and there insanely clung. LXXXIV I found the village, but its people knew No tidings: wearily awhile I trod Among black crosses in the churchyard sod, But who could guess the boy's? and why pursue A sickly fancy? In that peopled vale Death is not rare, alas! nor burials few, And soon the grassy coverlet of God Spreads equal green above their ashes pale. LXXXV 'T was eve: upon a lonely mound I sank That held no more its votive immortelles, And, over-worn and half-despairing, drank The vesper pity of the distant bells, Till sleep or trance descended, and my brain Forgot its echoes of eternal knells, Effaced its ceaseless images of pain, And, blank and helpless, knew repose again. LXXXVI I dreamed,—or was it dream? My Angelo Called somewhere out of distant space: I heard, Like faint but clearest music, every word. “Come, father, come!” he said; “it shines like snow, My house of marble: I've a speaking bird: A thousand roses in my garden grow: My fountains fall in basins dark as wine: Come to me, father,—all is yours and mine!” LXXXVII And then, one fleeting moment, blew aside The hovering mist of Sleep, and I could trace The phantom beauty of his joyous face: And, whitely glimmering, o'er him I espied A marble porch of stern Palladian grace,— Then faded all. The rest my heart supplied: Pandolfo's palace on my vision broke: “I come!” I cried; and with the cry awoke. BOOK IV THE PICTURE I As when a traveller, whose journey lies In some still valley, slowly wanders on By brook and meadow, cottage, bower, and lawn,— Familiar sights, that charm his level eyes For many a league, until, with late surprise He starts to find those gentle regions gone, And through the narrowing dell, whose crags enclose His path, irresolutely, sadly goes: II For what may wait beyond, he cannot guess, A garden or a desert,—in such wise I went, in ignorance that mocked the guise Of hope, and filled me with obscure distress. Locked in a pass of doubt, whose cliffs concealed The coming life, the temper of the skies, I craved the certain day, that soon should rise Upon a fortunate or fatal field! III The House of Life hath many chambers. He Who deems his mansion built, a dreamer vain, A tottering shell inhabits, and shall see The ruthless years hurl down his masonry; While they who plan but as they slowly gain, Where that which was gives that which is to be Its form and symbols, build the house divine,— In life a temple, and in death a shrine. IV And following as the guiding vision led, With briefest rest, with never-faltering feet, By highways white, through field or chattering street Or windy gorges of the hills I sped, And crossed the level floors of silk and wine, The slow canals, and, shrunken in their bed, The sandy rivers, till the welcome line Before me rose of Tuscan Apennine. V The southern slopes, with shout and festal song, Rejoiced in vintage: as I wandered by, Came faun-like figures, purple to the thigh From foaming vats, and laughing women, strong To bear their Bacchic loads: then, towards the town Through blended toil and revel hastening down, I saw the terrace—saw, and checked a cry,— Whence Clelia flung to me the jasmine crown! VI Alas! how changed from him that wreath who wore,— The youth all rapture, hope and sense uncloyed, New-landed on the world's illumined shore,— Walked now the man! My downward path before There sprang no arch of triumph from the void: No censers burned: not as a conqueror I entered Florence,—no! a slave, that fed On one last fragment of the feast I spread. VII There stretched the garden-wall: the yellow sun Above it burnished every cypress spire, Tipped the tall laurel-clumps with points of fire, And smote the palace-marbles till they won The golden gleam of ages. Yet, above That mellow splendor stood the beauty flown Of midnights, when around it blew and shone The breeze of Passion and the moon of Love! VIII At last—the door! With trembling touch I tried The latch: it shook: the rusty bolts gave way. As in a dream the roses I espied, Heard as in dreams the fountain's lulling play. There curled the dolphins in the shining shower And rode the Triton boys: on either side The turf was diapered with many a flower,— And darkling drooped our green betrothal bower. IX Scarce had I entered, when there came a sound Of voices from the pillared portico,— And twofold burst a cry, as Angelo, Across the paths, with wildly-joyous bound Sprang to my bosom: while, as one astound With sense of some unexpiated wrong, The nurse entreated: “Bid thy father go!” But “Stay!” he cried: “where hast thou been so long?” X “Stay, father! thou shalt paint me as thou wilt, Each morning, in the silent northern hall; But when, so tired, thou seest mine eyelids fall, Then shall I take my sword with golden hilt, And call the grooms, and bid them saddle straight For us the two white horses in the stall—” Here shrieked the nurse, with face of evil fate, “Go, Signor, go!—ah, God! too late—too late!” XI His haste dividing, him to clasp I knelt 'Twixt porch and fountain, blind with tearful joy As on my breast his beating heart I felt, And on my mouth the kisses of the boy, Wherein his mother's phantom kisses poured A stream of ancient rapture, love restored,— When, like the lightning ere the stroke is dealt, Before me flashed the old Marchese's sword! XII So haggard, sunken-eyed, convulsed with wrath That paints a devil on the face of age, He glared, that, quick to shield my child from scath,— To fly the menace of unreasoning rage,— I caught him in my cloak, and dashed apart The tangled roses of the garden-path: Pandolfo—hate such fatal swiftness hath— Leapt in advance, and thrust to pierce my heart! XIII I saw the flame-like sparkle of the blade: Heard, sharp and shrill, the nurse's fearful cry: Warm blood gushed o'er my hands: a fluttering sigh Came from the childish lips, that feebly made These words, as prompted by the darkening eye, “Good-night, my father!” And I knew not why My boy should sleep, so suddenly and so well,— But trembling seized me: clasping him, I fell. XIV Nor loosed my hold, although I dimly knew Pandolfo's hand let fall the blade accurst, And he, his race's hoary murderer, burst The awful stillness that around us grew, With miserable groans: his prostrate head Touched mine, as helpless, o'er the fading dead,— His hands met mine, and both as gently nursed The limbs, and strove to stay the warmth that fled. XV His Past, my Future, in the body met,— His wrongs, my hopes,—the selfsame fatal blow Dashed into darkness: blood Lethéan wet My blighted summer, his autumnal snow, And all of Life did either life forget, Except the piteous death between us so, Together pressed, involved in half-embrace, We hung above the cold, angelic face. XVI “Her father, why should Heaven direct thy hand Against her child, thy blood, chastising thee?” “I loved the boy”—“But couldst not pardon me, His father?” “Nay, but thou thyself hadst banned Beyond forgiveness!” “Even at his demand!” “Ah, no! for his sweet sake might all things be, Except to lose him.” “He is lost,—and we (Thou, too, old man!) are childless in the land!” XVII Thus brokenly, scarce knowing what we said, We clung like drowning men beneath the wave, That nor can hurt each other, nor can save, But breast to breast with iron arms are wed Till Death so leaves them. Us the servants led— Pale, awe-struck helpers—through the palace-door And glimmering halls, to lay on Clelia's bed The broken lily we together bore. XVIII God's thunder-stroke his haughty heart had bowed: It bled with mine among the common dust Where Rank puts on the sackcloth of the crowd, And sits in equal woe: his guilt avowed, And mine, there came a sad, remorseful trust, And while the double midnight gathered there From sable hangings and the starless air, We held each other's hands, and wept aloud. XIX And he confessed, how, after weary search And many a vain device employed, he found By chance in Zara, on Dalmatian ground, As altar-piece within a votive church Some shipwrecked Plutus built,—the Mother mild In whose foreboding face my Clelia smiled; And thence, by slow degrees, to Como's side Had followed home the trail I thought to hide. XX And there had seized me, but the boy displayed Patrician beauty, and the failing line, Now trembling o'er extinction, might evade Its fate in him. This changed the first design, And what the sordid nurse for gold betrayed Or those Art-hucksters chattered, easy made The rape, whose issue should, with even blow, Revenge and compensate: but now,—ah, woe! XXI The issue had been reached: too dark and drear, Too tragic, pitiful, and heart-forlorn, Could any heart contain it, to be borne,— And mine refused, rebelled. Behind his bier No meek-eyed Resignation walked, or Grief That catches sunshine in each falling tear To build her pious rainbow: but with scorn I thrust aside the truths that bring relief. XXII I spurned, though kindly,—for the old man's frame Stumbled in Death's advancing twilight,—all His offers: gold—the proud Pandolfan hall— Place, that should goad the lagging feet of Fame— And from his sombre palace, shuddering still, Cold with remembered horror, took my name, My own, restored; and climbed the northern hill As one who lives, though dead his living will. XXIII Some habit, working in my passive feet, Its guidance gave: the mornings came and went: Around me spread the fields, or closed the street, And often, Night's expanded firmament Opened above the lesser dome of Day, And wild, tumultuous tongues of darkness sent To vex my path,—till, in our old retreat, I ceased to hold my reckless heart at bay! XXIV Some natures are there, fashioned ere their birth For sun, and spring-time, and the bliss of earth; Who only sing, achieve, and triumph, when The Hours caress, and each bright circumstance Leaps to its place, as in a starry dance, To shape their story. These the fortunate men, When Fate consents, whose lives are ever young, And shine around whate'er they wrought or sung! XXV Akin to these am I,—or deemed it so, And thus beyond my present wreck beheld No far-off rescue. All my mind, impelled By some blind wrath that would resent the blow, Though impotent, caught action from despair, And reached, and groped,—as when a man lets go A jewel in the dark, and seeks it where The furzes prick him and the brambles tear. XXVI The clash of inconsistent qualities No labor stayed, or beauteous passion smoothed, But each let loose, and grasping, by degrees, Stole sway, made chaos. Turbulent, unsoothed By either's rule,—since order failed therein, And hope, the tidal star of restless seas,— I turned from every height, once fair to win, And sinned 'gainst Art the one unpardoned sin! XXVII For thus I reasoned: what avail my gifts, Which but attract, provoke the spoiling Fate?— Nor for themselves their destinies create, But task my life; and then the thunder rifts Their laid foundations! Why of finer nerve The members doomed to bear more cruel weight? Or daintier senses, if they only serve To double pangs, already doubly great? XXVIII Lo! yonder hind, on whom doth Life impose So slight a burden, finds his path prepared; Unthinking fares as all his fathers fared, And cheap-won joys and soon-subsiding woes Nor cleave his heart too deep, nor lift too high. Peaceful as dew-mist from an evening sky The years descend, until they bid him close Upon an easy world a quiet eye! XXIX He sees the shell of Earth—no more: yet more Were useless,—attributes of thankful toil; The olive orchards, dark with ripening oil; The misty grapes, the harvests, tawny-hoar; The glossy melons, swelling from the vine; The breezy lake, alive with darting spoil; And dances woo from yonder purple shore, And yonder Alps but cool his summer wine! XXX He lives the common life of Earth: she grants Result to instinct, food to appetite: With no repressed desire his bosom pants, Nor that self-torturing, questioning inward sight Vexes his light, unconscious consciousness. He loves, and multiplies his life,—no less His virile pride and fatherly delight; And all that smites me, visits him to bless. XXXI If this the law, that narrower powers enjoy Their use, denied the greater,—nay, are nursed And helped, while these their energies destroy In baffled aspirations, crossed and cursed By what with brightening promise lured them on,— Then life is false, its purposes reversed, Its luck for those who leave its veils undrawn, And Art the mocking glory of its dawn! XXXII Not calmly, as my memory now recalls The crisis,—fierce, vehemently, I tracked The fatal truth through every potent fact Of being: now in fancied carnivals Of sense abiding, now with gloomy face Fronting the deeper question that appalls, Of “Wherefore Life? and what this brawling race, Peopling a mote of dust in endless space?” XXXIII “O fools!” I cried, “O fools, a thousand-fold Tormented with your folly, seeking good Where Good is not, nor Evil!—words that hold Your natures captive, making ye the food And spoil of them that dare, with vision bold, See Nothingness!—slaves of transmitted fear, Of Power imagined, never understood, The Demon rules you still that set you here!” XXXIV The curse I would have broken bound me still. As flowery chains aforetime, fetters now Of tyrant Art subdued my wandering will, And made its youthful, glad, spontaneous vow An iron law, whence there was no escape. No rest, though hopeless, would my brain allow, But drew the pictures of its haunting ill, And gave its reckless fancies hue and shape. XXXV So, after many days, the cobwebbed door Gave sullen entrance: naught was there displaced; And first I turned, with pangs and shuddering haste, My young St. John,—I would not see it more. Then snatched an empty canvas from the floor And drew a devil: therein did I taste Fierce joys of liberty, for what I would I would,—Art was itself a Devilhood! XXXVI This guilty joy, the holiest to debase,— To use the cunning, born of pious toil, The purest features of my dreams to soil, And drag in ribaldry the pencil's grace,— Grew by indulgence. Forms and groups unclean Or mocking, faster than my hand could trace Their vivid, branding features, thrust a screen My restless woe and dead desire between. XXXVII Sometimes, perchance, a grim, sarcastic freak My pencil guided, and I stiffly drew Byzantine saints, of flat, insipid cheek And monstrous eye; or some Madonna meek, With dwarfish mouth, like those of Cimabue; Or martyr-figures, less of flesh than bone, Lean hands, and lips forever making moan,— A travesty of woe, distorted, weak. XXXVIII Or, higher ranging, touched the field that charms Monastic painters, who, in vision warm The Mystery grasp, and wondrous frescoes form Where God the Father, with widespreading arms, Rides on the whirlwind which His breath has made, Or sows His judgments, Earth in darkness laid Beneath Him,—works which only not blaspheme, Because the faith that wrought them was supreme. XXXIX Thus habit grew, imagination stalked In shameless hardihood from things profane To sacred: nothing hindered, awed, or baulked The appetite diseased, and such a plan I sketched, as never since the world began— So strange and mad—engendered any brain. Once entertained, the lovely-loathsome guest Clung to my fancy and my hand possessed. XL Not broad the canvas, but the shapes it showed, With utmost art defined, might almost seem To grow and spread, dilating with the theme. Filling the space, a lurid ocean glowed In endless billows, tipped with foam of fire, Shoreless: but far more dreadful than a dream Of Hell, the shapes which in that sea abode, With sting and fang, and scaly coil and spire! XLI One with a lizard's sinuous motion slipped Forth from the dun recesses of the wave, Man-eyed and browed, but tusked and lipped Like river-horse: its claws another drave Within a ghastly head, whose dim eyes gave Slow tears of blood: and with a burning tongue In brazen jaws out-thrust, another stripped From floating bones the flesh that round them clung! XLII And in the midst, suspended from above Just o'er the blazing foam, in light intense, A naked youth—a form of strength and love And beauty, perfect as the artist's sense Dreams of a god; and every glorious limb Burned in a glow that made those billows dim. A weird and awful brilliance, coming whence No eye might fathom, dashed alone on him! XLIII Let down from Somewhere by a mighty chain Linked round his middle, lightly, graciously He swung, and all his body seemed to be Compact of molten metal, such a stain Of angry scarlet streamed and shot around: The face convulsed, yet whether so with pain Or awful joy, no gazers might agree, And damp the crispy gold his brows that crowned. XLIV And, as he swung, all hybrid monsters near, Dark dragon-leech, huge vermin human-faced, Their green eyes turned on him with hideous leer, Or stretched abhorrent tentacles, to taste His falling ripeness. Through the picture spread A sense of tumult, hinting to the ear The snap and crackle of those waters red, And hiss, and howl, and bestial noises dread. XLV Unweariedly I wrought,—each grim detail As patient-perfect, as from Denner's brush, Of hair, or mouldy hide, or pliant mail, Or limbs, slow-parting, as the grinders crush Their quivering fibres: good the workmanship, Yet something unimagined seemed to fail,— A crowning Horror, in whose iron grip The heart should stifle, bloodless be the lip. XLVI This to invent, with hot, unresting mind I labored: early sat and late, possessed With evil images, with wicked zest To wreak my mood, though it might curse my kind, On Evil's purest type, and horridest; And never young ambition heretofore In noble service so itself outwore. What thus we seek, or soon or late we find. XLVII One morn of winter, when unmelted frost, Beneath a low-hung vault of moveless cloud, Silvered the world, even while my head was bowed In half-despair, my brain the Horror crossed, Unheralded; and never human will Achieved such fearful triumph! Never came The form of that which language cannot name, So armed the life of souls to crush and kill! XLVIII And this be never unto men revealed, To curse by mere existence! Knowledge taints, Drawn from such crypts, the whitest robes of saints; Though faith be firm, and warrior-virtue steeled Against assault, the Possible breaks in Their borders, and the soul that cannot yield Must needs receive the images it paints, And shudder, sinless, in the air of Sin! XLIX My blood runs chill, remembering now the laugh Wherewith, enlightened, I the pencil seized,— Half deadly-smitten, fascinated half, Yet sworn to do the dreadful thing I pleased! All things upheld my mood with evil guise: The palette-colors, to my sense diseased, Winked wickedly, like devils' slimy eyes, And darkness closed me from the drooping skies! L As when a harp-string in a silent room At midnight snaps, with weird, melodious twang, So suddenly, through inner, outer gloom A sweet, sharp sound, vibrating slowly, rang And sank to humming music; while a stream Of gathering odor followed, as in dream We braid the bliss of music and perfume,— And pierced, I sat, with some divinest pang. LI And, as from sound and fragrance born, a glow All rosy-golden, fair as Alpine snow At sunset, grew,—mist-like at first, and dim, But brightening, folding inwards, fold on fold, Until my ravished vision could behold Complete, each line of sunny-shining limb And sainted head, soft-posed as I had drawn My boy—my Angelo—my young St. John! LII O beauteous ghost! O sacred loveliness! Unworthy I to look upon thy face, Unworthy thy transfigured form to trace, That stood, expectant, waiting but to bless By miracle, where I intended crime! The folded scroll, the shadowy cross of reed He bore,—St. John, but not of mortal seed: So God beheld him, in that early time! LIII Dew came to burning eyes: a heavenly rain, A balmy deluge, bathed my arid heart, And washed that hateful fabric of the brain To rot, a ruin, in some Hell of Art. A sweet, unquestioning, obedient mood Made swift revulsion from the broken strain Of my revolt; and still the Phantom wooed, As bright, and wonderful, and mute, it stood. LIV Yet I, through all dissolving, trembling deeps Of consciousness, his angel-errand knew. The guilty picture fell, and forth I drew My dim St. John from out the dusty heaps, And cleansed it first, and kissed in reverence The shadowy lips,—fresh colors took, and true, And painted, while on each awakened sense The awful beauty of the Phantom grew. LV All hoarded craft, all purposes and powers Together worked: the scattered gleams of thought As through a glass my heart together brought To light my hand: the chariots of the Hours For me were stayed: I knew not Earth nor Time, But painted nimbly in a trance sublime, And tint by tint my charmèd pencil caught, And line by line, the loveliness it sought. LVI Mine eyes were purged from film: I saw and fixed The subtle secrets, not with old despair But with undoubting faith my colors mixed, And with unfaltering hand the breeze-blown hair, The dark, unfathomed eyes, the lips of youth, The dainty, fleeting grace that stands betwixt The babe and child, in members pure and bare, Portrayed, with joy that owned my pencil's truth. LVII And he, may heavenly model! how he shone, Unwearied, silent,—drawn, a golden form, Against the background of a sky of storm, On Ammon's desert hills! The landscape lone Through all its savage slopes and gorges smiled, Him to enframe, the God-selected child, And o'er the shadowy distance fell a gleam That touched with promised peace its barren dream. LVIII At last, the saffron clearness of the west, From under clouds, shot forth elegiac ray That sang the burial of the wondrous day: And sad, mysterious music in my breast, As at the coming, now the close expressed. Ah, God! I dared not watch him float away, But, seized and shaken by the fading spell, And covering up my face, exhausted fell. LIX There, when my beating heart no longer shook The sense that listened, though that music died, A solemn Presence lingered at my side; And drop by drop, as forms an infant brook Within a woodland hollow, soft, unheard, And out of nothing braids its slender tide, The sense of speech the living silence stirred And wordless sound became melodious word! LX “O weak of will!” (so spake what seemed a voice) “And slave of sense, that, hovering in extremes, Dost oversoar, and undermine thy dreams, Behold the lowest, highest! Make thy choice,— Lord of the vile or servant of the pure: Be free, range all that is, if better seems Freedom to smite thyself, than to endure The pain that worketh thine immortal cure! LXI “Lo! never any living brain knew peace, That saw not, rooted in the scheme of things, Assailing and protecting Evil! Cease To beat this steadfast law with bleeding wings, For know, that never any living brain, Which rested not within its ordered plane, Restrung the harp of life with sweeter strings, Or made new melodies, except of pain! LXII “Where wast thou, when the world's foundations first Were laid? Didst thou the azure tent unfold? Or bid the young May-morning's car of gold Herald the seasons? Wouldst thou see reversed The sacred order? Why, if life be cursed, Add to its curses thy rebellion bold? Or has thy finer wisdom only yearned For thankless gifts and recompense unearned? LXIII “Come, thou hast questioned God: I question thee. And truly thou art smitten,—yet repress Thine old impatience: calm the eyes that see How blows give strength, and sharpest sorrows bless. Free art thou: is thy liberty so fair To hide the ghost of vanished happiness, And sleep'st thou sweeter under skies, so bare These thunder-strokes were welcome to its air? LXIV “Why is thy life so sorely smitten? Wait, And thou shalt learn! Dead stones thy teachers were: Through years of toil thy hand did minister To joyous Art: thou wast content with Fate. Take now thy ruined passion, fix its date, Peruse its growth, and, if thou canst replan The blended facts of Life that made thee man;— Could aught be spared, or changed for other state? LXV “Not less thy breathing bliss than yonder hind Thou enviest, but more: therein it lies, That each experience brings a twin surprise, As mirrored in the glad, creative mind, And in the beating heart. Behold! he bows To adverse circumstance, to change and death; But thou wouldst place thy fortune his beneath, Shaming the double glory on thy brows! LXVI “His pangs outworn, perchance some feeling lives For those of others: thine the lordly power Transmuting all that loss or suffering gives To Beauty! Even thy most despairing hour Some darker grace informs, and like a bee Thine Art sits hoarding in thy Passion's flower: So vast thy need, no phase thine eye can see Of Earth or Life, that not enriches thee! LXVII “Such is the Artist,—drawing precious use From every fate, and so by laws divine Encompassed, that in glad obedience shine His works the fairer: his the flag of truce Between the warring worlds of soul and sense: By neither mastered, holding both apart, Or blending in a newer excellence, He weds the haughty brain and yearning heart. LXVIII “Beneath tempestuous, shifting movement laid, The base of steadfast Order he beholds, And from the central vortex, unafraid, Marks how all action evermore unfolds Forth from a point of absolute repose, Which hints of God; and how, in gleams betrayed, The Perfect even in imperfection shows,— And Earth a bud, but breathing of the rose!” LXIX Even as the last stroke of a Sabbath bell, Heard in the Sabbath silence of a dell, Sounds on and on, with fainter, thinner note, Distincter ever, till its dying swell Draws after it the listener's ear, to float Farther and farther into skies remote,— So, when what seemed a voice had ceased, the strain Drew after it the waiting, listening brain. LXX And, following far, my senses on the track Slid into darkness. Dead to life, I lay Plunged in oblivious slumber, still and black, All through the night and deep into the day: Yet was it sleep, not trance,—restoring Sleep, That from the restless soul its house of clay Protects, and when I woke, her dew so deep Had drenched, the wondrous Past was washed away. LXXI But there, before me, its recorded gift Flashed from the easel, so divinely bright It shamed the morning: then, returning swift, The wave of Memory rolled, and pure delight Filled mine awakening spirit, and I wept With contrite heart, redeemed, enfranchised quite: My sick revolt was healed,—the Demon slept, And God was good, and Earth her promise kept. LXXII I wandered forth; and lo! the halcyon world Of sleeping wave, and velvet-folded hill, And stainless air and sunshine, lay so still! No mote of vapor on the mountains curled; But lucid, gem-like, blissful, as if sin Or more than gentlest grief had never been, Each lovely thing, of tint that shone impearled, As dwelt some dim beatitude therein! LXXIII There, as I stood, the contadini came With anxious, kindly faces, seeking me; And caught my hands, and called me by my name, As one from danger snatched might welcomed be. Such had they feared, their gentle greeting told,— Seeing the cottage shut, the chimney free Of that blue household breath, whose rings, unrolled, The sign of home, the life of landscape, hold. LXXIV So God's benignant hand directing wrought, And Man and Nature took me back to life. My cry was hushed: the forms of child and wife Smiled from a solemn, moonlit land of thought, A realm of peaceful sadness. Sad, yet strong, My soul stood up, threw off its robes of strife, And quired anew the world-old human song,— Accepting patience and forgetting wrong! LXXV Erelong, my living joy in Art returned, But reverently felt, and purified By recognition of the bounty spurned, And meek acceptance in the place of pride. Yet nevermore should brush of mine be drawn O'er the unfinished picture of St. John: What from the lovely miracle I learned, The lines of colder toil should never hide. LXXVI Though incomplete, it gave the prophecy Of far-off power, whereto my patient mind Must set its purpose,—saying unto me: “Make sure the gift, the fleeting fortune bind,— What once a moment was, may ever be!” And when, in time, this hope securer grew, Unto the picture, whence my truth I drew, A sacred dedication I assigned. LXXVII Pandolfo dead, the body of my child Upon his mother's lonely breast I laid, A late return; and o'er their ashes made A chapel, in the green Bohemian wild, For weary toil, pure thought, and silent prayer,— A simple shrine, of all adornment bare, Save o'er the altar, where, completed now, St. John looks down, with Heaven upon his brow! LXXVIII The Past accepts no sacrifice: its gates Alike atonement and revenge out-bar. We take its color, yet our spirits are Thrust forward by a power which antedates Their own: the hand of Art outreaches Fate's, And lifts the bright, unrisen, refracted star Above our dark horizon, showing thus A future to the faith that fades in us. LXXIX Not with that vanity of shallow minds Which apes the speech, and shames the noble truth Of them whose pride is knowledge,—nor of Youth The dazzling, dear mirage, that never finds Itself o'ertaken,—but with trust in fame, As knowing fame, and owning now the pure And humble will which makes achievement sure, I, Egon, here the Artist's title claim! LXXX The forms of Earth, the masks of Life, I see, Yet see wherein they fail: with eager eyes I hunt the wandering gleams of harmony, The rarer apparitions which surprise With hints of Beauty, fixing these alone In wedded grace of form and tint and tone, That so the thing, transfigured, shall arise Beyond itself, and truly live in me. LXXXI And I shall paint, discerning where the line Wavers between the Human and Divine,— Nor to the Real in servile bondage bound, Nor scorning it: nor with supernal themes Feeding the moods of o'er-aspiring dreams, (For mortal triumph is a god uncrowned,)— But by Proportion ruled, and by Repose, And by the Soul supreme whence they arose. LXXXII Not clamoring for over-human bliss, Yet now no more unhappy,—not elate As one exalted o'er the level state Of these ungifted lives, yet strong in this, That I the sharpest stab and sweetest kiss Have tasted, suffered,—I can stand and wait, Serene in knowledge, in obedience free, The only master of my destiny! LXXXIII And thus as in a clear, revealing noon I live. So comes, sometimes, a mountain day: A vague, uncertain, misty morn, and soon Sharp-smiting sun, and winds' and lightning's play,— A drear confusion, by the final crash Dispersed, and ere meridian blown away; And all the peaks shine bare, the waters flash, And Earth lies open to the golden ray! LXXXIV Lonely, perchance, but as these dark-browed hills Are lonely, belted round with broader spheres Of bluer world, my life its peace fulfils In poise of soul: the long, laborious years Await me: closed my holy task, I go To reaccept, beyond the Alpine snow, The gage of glorious battle with my peers,— Not each of each, but of false art, the foe. LXXXV Once more, O lovely, piteous, shaping Past, I kiss thy lips: now let thy face be hid, And this green turf above thy coffin-lid Be turned to violets! The forests cast Their shadowy arms across the quiet vale, And all sweet sounds the coming rest foretell, And earth takes glory as the sky grows pale, So fond and beautiful the Day's farewell! LXXXVI Farewell, then, thou embosomed isle of peace In restless waters! Let the years increase With unexpected blessing: thou shalt lie As in her crystal shell the maiden lay, Watched o'er by weeping dwarfs,—too fair to die, Yet charmed from life: and there may come a day Which crowns Desire with gift, and Art with truth, And Love with bliss, and Life with wiser youth! HOME BALLADS THE QUAKER WIDOW I Thee finds me in the garden, Hannah,—come in! 'Tis kind of thee To wait until the Friends were gone, who came to comfort me. The still and quiet company a peace may give, indeed, But blessed is the single heart that comes to us at need. II Come, sit thee down! Here is the bench where Benjamin would sit On First-day afternoons in spring, and watch the swallows flit: He loved to smell the sprouting box, and hear the pleasant bees Go humming round the lilacs and through the apple-trees. III I think he loved the spring: not that he cared for flowers: most men Think such things foolishness,—but we were first acquainted then, One spring: the next he spoke his mind; the third I was his wife, And in the spring (it happened so) our children entered life. IV He was but seventy-five: I did not think to lay him yet In Kennett graveyard, where at Monthly Meeting first we met. The Father's mercy shows in this: 't is better I should be Picked out to bear the heavy cross—alone in age—than he. V We 've lived together fifty years: it seems but one long day, One quiet Sabbath of the heart, till he was called away; And as we bring from Meeting-time a sweet contentment home, So, Hannah, I have store of peace for all the days to come. VI I mind (for I can tell thee now) how hard it was to know If I had heard the spirit right, that told me I should go; For father had a deep concern upon his mind that day, But mother spoke for Benjamin,—she knew what best to say. VII Then she was still: they sat awhile: at last she spoke again, “The Lord incline thee to the right!” and “Thou shalt have him, Jane!” My father said. I cried. Indeed, 't was not the least of shocks, For Benjamin was Hicksite, and father Orthodox. VIII I thought of this ten years ago, when daughter Ruth we lost: Her husband 's of the world, and yet I could not see her crossed. She wears, thee knows, the gayest gowns, she hears a hireling priest— Ah, dear! the cross was ours: her life's a happy one, at least. IX Perhaps she'll wear a plainer dress when she's as old as I,— Would thee believe it, Hannah? once I felt temptation nigh! My wedding-gown was ashen silk, too simple for my taste: I wanted lace around the neck, and a ribbon at the waist. X How strange it seemed to sit with him upon the women's side! I did not dare to lift my eyes: I felt more fear than pride, Till, “in the presence of the Lord,” he said, and then there came A holy strength upon my heart, and I could say the same. XI I used to blush when he came near, but then I showed no sign; With all the meeting looking on, I held his hand in mine. It seemed my bashfulness was gone, now I was his for life: Thee knows the feeling, Hannah,—thee, too, hast been a wife. XII As home we rode, I saw no fields look half so green as ours; The woods were coming into leaf, the meadows full of flowers; The neighbors met us in the lane, and every face was kind,— 'T is strange how lively everything comes back upon my mind. XIII I see, as plain as thee sits there, the wedding-dinner spread: At our own table we were guests, with father at the head, And Dinah Passmore helped us both,—'t was she stood up with me, And Abner Jones with Benjamin,—and now they're gone, all three! XIV It is not right to wish for death; the Lord disposes best. His Spirit comes to quiet hearts, and fits them for His rest; And that He halved our little flock was merciful, I see: For Benjamin has two in heaven, and two are left with me. XV Eusebius never cared to farm,—'t was not his call, in truth, And I must rent the dear old place, and go to daughter Ruth. Thee'll say her ways are not like mine,—young people now-a-days Have fallen sadly off, I think, from all the good old ways. XVI But Ruth is still a Friend at heart; she keeps the simple tongue, The cheerful, kindly nature we loved when she was young; And it was brought upon my mind, remembering her, of late, That we on dress and outward things perhaps lay too much weight. XVII I once heard Jesse Kersey say, a spirit clothed with grace, And pure, almost, as angels are, may have a homely face. And dress may be of less account: the Lord will look within: The soul it is that testifies of righteousness or sin. XVIII Thee must n't be too hard on Ruth: she's anxious I should go, And she will do her duty as a daughter should, I know. 'T is hard to change so late in life, but we must be resigned: The Lord looks down contentedly upon a willing mind. 1860. THE HOLLY-TREE I The corn was warm in the ground, the fences were mended and made, And the garden-beds, as smooth as a counterpane is laid, Were dotted and striped with green where the peas and radishes grew, With elecampane at the foot, and comfrey, and sage, and rue. II The work was done on the farm, 't was orderly everywhere, And comfort smiled from the earth, and rest was felt in the air. When a Saturday afternoon at such a time comes round, The farmer's fancies grow, as grows the grain in his ground. III 'T was so with Gabriel Parke: he stood by the holly-tree That came, in the time of Penn, with his fathers over the sea: A hundred and eighty years it had grown where it first was set, And the thorny leaves were thick and the trunk was sturdy yet. IV From the knoll where stood the house the fair fields pleasantly rolled To dells where the laurels hung, and meadows of buttercup gold: He looked on them all by turns, with joy in his acres free, But ever his thoughts came back to the tale of the holly-tree. V In beautiful Warwickshire, beside the Avon stream, John Parke, in his English home, had dreamed a singular dream. He went with a sorrowful heart, for love of a bashful maid, And a vision came as he slept one day in a holly's shade. VI An angel sat in the boughs, and showed him a goodly land, With hills that fell to a brook, and forests on either hand, And said: “Thou shalt wed thy love, and this shall belong to you; For the earth has ever a home for a tender heart and true!” VII Even so it came to pass, as the angel promised then: He wedded and wandered forth with the earliest friends of Penn, And the home foreshown he found, with all that a home endears,— A nest of plenty and peace, for a hundred and eighty years! VIII In beautiful Warwickshire the life of the two began,— A slip of the tree of the dream, a far-off sire of the man; And it seemed to Gabriel Parke, as the leaves above him stirred, That the secret dream of his heart the soul of the holly heard. IX Of Patience Phillips he thought: she, too, was a bashful maid: The blue of her eyes was hid by the eyelash's golden shade; But well that she could not hide the cheeks that were fair to see As the pink of an apple-bud, ere the blossom snows the tree! X Ah! how had the English Parke to the English girl betrayed, Save a dream had helped his heart, the love that makes afraid?— That seemed to smother his voice, when his blood so sweetly ran, And the baby heart lay weak in the rugged breast of the man? XI His glance came back from the hills and back from the laurel glen, And fell on the grass at his feet, where clucked a mother-hen, With a brood of tottering chicks, that followed as best they might; But one was trodden and lame, and drooped in a woful plight. XII He lifted up from the grass the feeble, chittering thing, And warmed its breast at his lips, and smoothed its stumpy wing, When, lo! at his side a voice: “Is it hurt?” was all she said: But the eyes of both were shy, and the cheeks of both were red. XIII She took from his hand the chick, and fondled and soothed it then, While, knowing that good was meant, cheerfully clucked the hen; And the tongues of the two were loosed: there seemed a wonderful charm In talk of the hatching fowls and spring-work done on the farm. XIV But Gabriel saw that her eyes were drawn to the holly-tree: “Have you heard,” he said, “how it came with the family over the sea?” He told the story again, though he knew she knew it well, And a spark of hope, as he spake, like fire in his bosom fell. XV “I dreamed a beautiful dream, here, under the tree, just now,” He said; and Patience felt the warmth of his eyes on her brow: “I dreamed, like the English Parke; already the farm I own, But the rest of the dream is best—the land is little, alone.” XVI He paused, and looked at the maid: her flushing cheek was bent, And, under her chin, the chick was cheeping its warm content; But naught she answered—then he: “O Patience! I thought of you! Tell me you take the dream, and help me to make it true!” XVII The mother looked from the house, concealed by the window-pane, And she felt that the holly's spell had fallen upon the twain; She guessed from Gabriel's face what the words he had spoken were, And blushed in the maiden's stead, as if they were spoken to her. XVIII She blushed, and she turned away, ere the trembling man and maid Silently hand in hand had kissed in the holly's shade, And Patience whispered at last, her sweet eyes dim with dew: “O Gabriel! could you dream as much as I 've dreamed of you?” XIX The mother said to herself, as she sat in her straight old chair: “He 's got the pick of the flock, so tidy and kind and fair! At first I shall find it hard, to sit and be still, and see How the house is kept to rights by somebody else than me. XX “But the home must be theirs alone: I'll do by her, if I can, As Gabriel's grandmother did, when I as a wife began: So good and faithful he's been, from the hour when I gave him life, He shall master be in the house, and mistress shall be his wife!” 1869. JOHN REED There's a mist on the meadow below; the herring-frogs chirp and cry; It 's chill when the sun is down, and the sod is not yet dry: The world is a lonely place, it seems, and I don't know why. I see, as I lean on the fence, how wearily trudges Dan With the feel of the spring in his bones, like a weak and elderly man; I 've had it a many a time, but we must work when we can. But day after day to toil, and ever from sun to sun, Though up to the season's front and nothing be left undone, Is ending at twelve like a clock, and beginning again at one. The frogs make a sorrowful noise, and yet it's the time they mate; There 's something comes with the spring, a lightness or else a weight; There 's something comes with the spring, and it seems to me it's fate. It 's the hankering after a life that you never have learned to know; It 's the discontent with a life that is always thus and so; It 's the wondering what we are, and where we are going to go. My life is lucky enough, I fancy, to most men's eyes, For the more a family grows, the oftener some one dies, And it's now run on so long, it could n't be otherwise. And Sister Jane and myself, we have learned to claim and yield; She rules in the house at will, and I in the barn and field, So, nigh upon thirty years!—as if written and signed and sealed. I could n't change if I would; I've lost the how and the when; One day my time will be up, and Jane be the mistress then, For single women are tough, and live down the single men. She kept me so to herself, she was always the stronger hand, And my lot showed well enough, when I looked around in the land; But I'm tired and sore at heart, and I don't quite understand. I wonder how it had been if I'd taken what others need, The plague, they say, of a wife, the care of a younger breed? If Edith Pleasanton now were with me as Edith Reed? Suppose that a son well grown were there in the place of Dan, And I felt myself in him, as I was when my work began? I should feel no older, sure, and certainly more a man! A daughter, besides, in the house; nay, let there be two or three! We never can overdo the luck that can never be, And what has come to the most might also have come to me. I 've thought, when a neighbor's wife or his child was carried away, That to have no loss was a gain; but now,—I can hardly say; He seems to possess them still, under the ridges of clay. And share and share in a life is, somehow, a different thing From property held by deed, and the riches that oft take wing; I feel so close in the breast!—I think it must be the spring. I'm drying up like a brook when the woods have been cleared around; You 're sure it must always run, you are used to the sight and sound, But it shrinks till there's only left a stony rut in the ground. There 's nothing to do but take the days as they come and go, And not to worry with thoughts that nobody likes to show, For people so seldom talk of the things they want to know. There 's times when the way is plain, and everything nearly right, And then, of a sudden, you stand like a man with a clouded sight: A bush seems often a beast, in the dusk of the falling night. I must move; my joints are stiff; the weather is breeding rain, And Dan is hurrying on with his plough-team up the lane. I'll go to the village-store; I'd rather not talk with Jane. 1872. JANE REED “If I could forget,” she said, “forget, and begin again! We see so dull at the time, and, looking back, so plain: There 's a quiet that's worse, I think, than many a spoken strife, And it 's wrong that one mistake should change the whole of a life. “There 's John, forever the same, so steady, sober, and mild; He never storms as a man who never cried as a child: Perhaps my ways are harsh, but if he would seem to care, There 'd be fewer swallowed words and a lighter load to bear. “Here, Cherry!—she's found me out, the calf I raised in the spring, And a likely heifer she's grown, the foolish, soft-eyed thing! Just the even color I like, without a dapple or speck,— O Cherry, bend down your head, and let me cry on your neck! “The poor dumb beast she is, she never can know nor tell, And it seems to do me good, the very shame of the spell: So old a woman and hard, and Joel so old a man.— But the thoughts of the old go on as the thoughts of the young began! “It 's guessing that wastes the heart, far worse than the surest fate: If I knew he had thought of me, I could quietly work and wait; And then when either, at last, on a bed of death should lie, Why, one might speak the truth, and the other hear and die!” She leaned on the heifer's neck; the dry leaves fell from the boughs, And over the sweet late grass of the meadow strayed the cows: The golden dodder meshed the cardinal-flower by the rill; There was autumn haze in the air, and sunlight low on the hill. “I 've somehow missed my time,” she said to herself and sighed: “What girls are free to hope, a steady woman must hide, But the need outstays the chance: it makes me cry and laugh, To think that the only thing I can talk to now is a calf!” A step came down from the hill: she did not turn or rise; There was something in her heart that saw without the eyes. She heard the foot delay, as doubting to stay or go: “Is the heifer for sale?” he said. She sternly answered, “No!” She lifted her head as she spoke: their eyes a moment met, And her heart repeated the words, “If I could only forget!” He turned a little away, but her lowered eyes could see His hand, as it picked the bark from the trunk of a hickory-tree. “Why can't we be friendly, Jane?” his words came, strange and slow; “You seem to bear me a grudge, so long, and so long ago! You were gay and free with the rest, but always so shy of me, That, before my freedom came, I saw that it could n't be.” “Joel!” was all she cried, as their glances met again, And a sudden rose effaced her pallor of age and pain. He picked at the hickory bark: “It's a curious thing to say; But I'm lonely since Phœbe died and the girls are married away. “That 's why these thoughts come back: I'm a little too old for pride, And I never could understand how love should be all one side: 'T would answer itself, I thought, and time would show me how; But it did n't come so, then, and it does n't seem so, now!” “Joel, it came so, then!”—and her voice was thick with tears: “A hope for a single day, and a bitter shame for years!” He snapped the ribbon of bark; he turned from the hickory-tree: “Jane, look me once in the face, and say that you thought of me!” She looked, and feebly laughed: “It's a comfort to know the truth, Though the chance was thrown away in the blind mistake of youth.” “And a greater comfort, Jane,” he said, with a tender smile, “To find the chance you have lost, and keep it a little while.” She rose as he spake the words: the petted heifer thrust Her muzzle between the twain, with an animal's strange mistrust: But over the creature's neck he drew her to his breast: “A horse is never so old but it pulls with another best!” “It 's enough to know,” she said; “to remember, not forget!” “Nay, nay: for the rest of life we'll pay each other's debt!” She had no will to resist, so kindly was she drawn, And she sadly said, at last, “But what will become of John?” 1876. THE OLD PENNSYLVANIA FARMER I Well—well! this is a comfort, now—the air is mild as May, And yet 't is March the twentieth, or twenty-first, to-day: And Reuben ploughs the hill for corn; I thought it would be tough, But now I see the furrows turned, I guess it 's dry enough. II I don't half live, penned up in-doors; a stove's not like the sun. When I can't see how things go on, I fear they're badly done: I might have farmed till now, I think—one's family is so queer— As if a man can't oversee who's in his eightieth year! III Father, I mind, was eighty-five before he gave up his; But he was dim o' sight, and crippled with the rheumatiz. I followed in the old, steady way, so he was satisfied; But Reuben likes new-fangled things and ways I can't abide. IV I'm glad I built this southern porch; my chair seems easier here: I have n't seen as fine a spring this five-and-twenty year! And how the time goes round so quick!—a week, I would have sworn Since they were husking on the flat, and now they plough for corn! V When I was young, time had for me a lazy ox's pace, But now it 's like a blooded horse, that means to win the race. And yet I can't fill out my days, I tire myself with naught; I 'd rather use my legs and hands than plague my head with thought. VI There 's Marshall, too, I see from here: he and his boys begin. Why don't they take the lower field? that one is poor and thin. A coat of lime it ought to have, but they 're a doless set: They think swamp-mud's as good, but we shall see what corn they get! VII Across the level, Brown's new place begins to make a show; I thought he'd have to wait for trees, but, bless me, how they grow! They say it 's fine—two acres filled with evergreens and things; But so much land! it worries me, for not a cent it brings. VIII He has the right, I don't deny, to please himself that way, But 't is a bad example set, and leads young folks astray: Book-learning gets the upper-hand and work is slow and slack, And they that come long after us will find things gone to wrack. IX Now Reuben's on the hither side, his team comes back again; I know how deep he sets the share, I see the horses strain: I had that field so clean of stones, but he must plough so deep, He'll have it like a turnpike soon, and scarcely fit for sheep. X If father lived, I 'd like to know what he would say to these New notions of the younger men, who farm by chemistries: There 's different stock and other grass; there's patent plough and cart— Five hundred dollars for a bull! it would have broke his heart. XI The maples must be putting out: I see a something red Down yonder where the clearing laps across the meadow's head. Swamp-cabbage grows beside the run; the green is good to see, But wheat 's the color, after all, that cheers and 'livens me. XII They think I have an easy time, no need to worry now— Sit in the porch all day and watch them mow, and sow, and plough: Sleep in the summer in the shade, in winter in the sun— I 'd rather do the thing myself, and know just how it 's done! XIII Well—I suppose I'm old, and yet 't is not so long ago When Reuben spread the swath to dry, and Jesse learned to mow, And William raked, and Israel hoed, and Joseph pitched with me: But such a man as I was then my boys will never be! XIV I don't mind William's hankering for lectures and for books; He never had a farming knack—you'd see it in his looks; But handsome is that handsome does, and he is well to do: 'T would ease my mind if I could say the same of Jesse, too. XV There 's one black sheep in every flock, so there must be in mine, But I was wrong that second time his bond to undersign: It 's less than what his share will be—but there's the interest! In ten years more I might have had two thousand to invest. XVI There 's no use thinking of it now, and yet it makes me sore; The way I 've slaved and saved, I ought to count a little more. I never lost a foot of land, and that 's a comfort, sure, And if they do not call me rich, they cannot call me poor. XVII Well, well! ten thousand times I've thought the things I'm thinking now; I 've thought them in the harvest-field and in the clover-mow; And often I get tired of them, and wish I'd something new— But this is all I 've had and known; so what's a man to do? XVIII 'T is like my time is nearly out, of that I'm not afraid; I never cheated any man, and all my debts are paid. They call it rest that we shall have, but work would do no harm; There can't be rivers there and fields, without some sort o' farm! 1869. HOME PASTORALS 1869-1874 AD AMICOS MOUNT CUBA, OCTOBER 10, 1874. Sometimes an hour of Fate's serenest weather Strikes through our changeful sky its coming beams; Somewhere above us, in elusive ether, Waits the fulfilment of our dearest dreams. So, when the wayward time and gift have blended, When hope beholds relinquished visions won, The heavens are broken and a blue more splendid Holds in its bosom an enchanted sun. Then words unguessed, in faith's own shyness guarded, To ears unused their welcome music bear: Then hands help on that doubtingly retarded, And love is liberal as the Summer air. The thorny chaplet of a slow probation Becomes the laurel Fate so long denied; The form achieved smiles on the aspiration, And dream is deed and Art is justified! Ah, nevermore the dull neglect, that smothers The bard's dependent being, shall return; Forgotten lines are on the lips of others, Extinguished thoughts in other spirits burn! Still hoarded lives what seemed so spent and wasted, And echoes come from dark or empty years; Here brims the golden cup, no more untasted, But fame is dim through mists of grateful tears. I sang but as the living spirit taught me, Beat towards the light, perchance with wayward wing; And still must answer, for the cheer you've brought me: I sang because I could not choose but sing. From that wide air, whose greedy silence swallows So many voices, even as mine seemed lost, I hear you speak, and sudden glory follows, As from a falling tongue of Pentecost. So heard and hailed by you, that, standing nearest, Blend love with faith in one far-shining flame, I hold anew the earliest gift and dearest,— The happy Song that cares not for its fame! PROEM I Now, when the mocking-bird returned, from his Florida winter, Sings where the sprays of the elm first touch the plumes of the cypress; When on the southern porch the stars of the jessamine sparkle Faint in the dusk of leaves; and the thirsty ear of the Poet Calls for the cup of song himself must mix ere it gladden,— Careful vintager first, though latest guest at the banquet,— Where shall he turn? What foreign Muse invites to her vineyard? Out of what bloom of the Past the wine of remoter romances? Foxy our grapes, of earthy tang and a wildwood astringence Unto fastidious tongues; but later, it may be, their juices, Mellowed by time, shall grow to be sweet on the palates of others. So will I paint in my verse the forms of the life I am born to, Not mediæval, or ancient! For whatso hath palpable colors. Drawn from being and blood, nor thrown by the spectrum of Fancy, Charms in the Future even as truth of the Past in the Present. II Not for this, nor for nearer voices of intimate counsel,— When were ever they heeded?—but since I am sated with visions, Sated with all the siren Past and its rhythmical phantoms, Here will I seek my songs in the quiet fields of my boyhood, Here, where the peaceful tent of home is pitched for a season. High is the house and sunny the lawn: the capes of the woodlands Bluff, and buttressed with many boughs, are gates to the distance, Blue with hill over hill, that sink as the pausing of music. Here the hawthorn blossoms, the breeze is blithe in the orchards, Winds from the Chesapeake dull the sharper edge of the winters, Letting the cypress live, and the mounded box, and the holly; Here the chestnuts fall and the cheeks of peaches are crimson, Ivy clings to the wall and sheltered fattens the fig-tree. North and South are as one in the blended growth of the region, One in the temper of man, and ancient, inherited habits. III Yet, though fair as the loveliest landscapes of pastoral England, Who hath touched them with song? and whence my music, and whither? Life still bears the stamp of its early struggle and labor, Still is shorn of its color by pious Quaker repression, Still is turbid with calm, or only swift in the shallows. Gone are the olden cheer, the tavern-dance and the fox-hunt, Muster at trainings, buxom lasses that rode upon pillions, Husking-parties and jovial home-comings after the wedding, Gone, as they never had been!—and now, the serious people Solemnly gather to hear some wordy itinerant speaker Talking of Temperance, Peace, or the Right of Suffrage for Women. Sport, that once like a boy was equally awkward and restless, Sits with thumb in his mouth, while a petulant ethical bantling Struts with his rod, and threatens our careless natural joyance. Weary am I with all this preaching the force of example, Painful duty to self, and painfuller still to one's neighbor, Moral shibboleths, dinned in one's ears with slavering unction, Till, for the sake of a change, profanity loses its terrors. IV Clearly, if song is here to be found, I must seek it within me: Song, the darling spirit that ever asserted her freedom, Soaring on sunlit wing above the clash of opinions, Poised at the height of Good with a sweeter and lovelier instinct! Call thee I will not, my life's one dear and beautiful Angel. Wayward, faithful and fond; but, like the Friends in the Meeting, Waiting, will so dispose my soul in the pastoral stillness, That, denied to Desire, Obedience yet may invite thee! MAY-TIME I Yes, it is May! though not that the young leaf pushes its velvet Out of the sheath, that the stubbornest sprays are beginning to bourgeon, Larks responding aloft to the mellow flute of the bluebird, Nor that song and sunshine and odors of life are immingled Even as wines in a cup; but that May, with her delicate philtres Drenches the veins and the valves of the heart,—a double possession, Touching the sleepy sense with sweet, irresistible languor, Piercing, in turn, the languor with flame: as the spirit, requickened Stirred in the womb of the world, foreboding a birth and a being! II Who can hide from her magic, break her insensible thraldom, Clothing the wings of eager delight as with plumage of trouble? Sweeter, perchance, the embryo Spring, forerunner of April, When on banks that slope to the south the saxifrage wakens, When, beside the dentils of frost that cornice the road-side, Weeds are a promise, and woods betray the trailing arbutus. Once is the sudden miracle seen, the truth and its rapture Felt, and the pulse of the possible May is throbbing already. Thus unto me, a boy, the clod that was warm in the sunshine, Murmurs of thaw, and imagined hurry of growth in the herbage, Airs from over the southern hills,—and something within me Catching a deeper sign from these than ever the senses,— Came as a call: I awoke, and heard, and endeavored to answer. Whence should fall in my lap the sweet, impossible marvel? When would the silver fay appear from the willowy thicket? When from the yielding rock the gnome with his basket of jewels? “When, ah when?” I cried, on the steepest perch of the hillside Standing with arms outspread, and waiting a wind that should bear me Over the apple-tree tops and over the farms of the valley. III He, that will, let him backward set the stream of his fancy, So to evoke a dream from the ruined world of his boyhood! Lo, it is easy! Yonder, lapped in the folds of the uplands, Bickers the brook, to warmer hollows southerly creeping, Where the veronica's eyes are blue, the buttercup brightens, Where the anemones blush, the coils of fern are unrolling Hour by hour, and over them flutter the sprinkles of shadow. There shall I lie and dangle my naked feet in the water, Watching the sleeping buds as one after one they awaken, Seeking a lesson in each, a brookside primrose of Wordsworth?— Lie in the lap of May, as a babe that loveth the cradle, I, whom her eye inspires, whom the breath of her passion arouses? Say, shall I stray with bended head to look for her posies, When with other wings than the coveted lift of the breezes Far I am borne, at her call: and the pearly abysses are parted Under my flight: the glimmering edge of the planet, receding, Rounds to the splendider sun and ripens to glory of color. Veering at will, I view from a crest of the jungled Antilles Sparkling, limitless billows of greenness, falling and flowing Into fringes of palm and the foam of the blossoming coffee,— Cratered isles in the offing, milky blurs of the coral Keys, and vast, beyond, the purple arc of the ocean: Or, in the fanning furnace-winds of the tenantless Pampas, Hear the great leaves clash, the shiver and hiss of the reed-beds. Thus for the crowded fulness of life I leave its beginnings, Not content to feel the sting of an exquisite promise Ever renewed and accepted, and ever freshly forgotten. IV Wherefore, now, recall the pictures of memory? Wherefore Yearn for a fairer seat of life than this I have chosen? Ah, while my quiver of wandering years was yet unexhausted, Treading the lands, a truant that wasted the gifts of his freedom, Sweet was the sight of a home—or tent, or cottage, or castle,— Sweet unto pain; and never beheld I a Highlander's shieling, Never a Flemish hut by a lazy canal and its pollards, Never the snowy gleam of a porch through Apennine orchards, Never a nest of life on the hoary hills of Judæa, Dropped on the steppes of the Don, or hidden in valleys of Norway, But, with the fond and foolish trick of a heart that was homeless, Each was mine, as I passed: I entered in and possessed it, Looked, in fancy, forth, and adjusted my life to the landscape. Easy it seemed, to shift the habit of blood as a mantle, Fable a Past, and lightly take the form of the Future, So that a rest were won, a hold for the filaments, floating Loose in the winds of Life. Here, now, behold it accomplished! Nay, but the restless Fate, the certain Nemesis follows, As to the bird the voice that bids him prepare for his passage, Saying: “Not this is the whole, not these, nor any, the borders Set for thy being; this measured, slow repetition of Nature, Painting, effacing, in turn, with hardly a variant outline, Cannot replace for thee the Earth's magnificent frescoes! Art thou content to inhabit a simple pastoral chamber, Leaving the endless halls of her grandeur and glory untrodden?” V Man, I answer, is more: I am glutted with physical beauty Born of the suns and rains and the plastic throes of the ages. Man is more; but neither dwarfed like a tree of the Arctic Vales, nor clipped into shape as a yew in the gardens of princes. Give me to know him, here, where inherited laws and disguises Hide him at times from himself,—where his thought is chiefly collective, Where, with numberless others fettered like slaves in a coffle, Each insists he is free, inasmuch as his bondage is willing. Who hath rent from the babe the primitive rights of his nature? Who hath fashioned his yoke? who patterned beforehand his manhood? Say, shall never a soul be moved to challenge its portion, Seek for a wider heritage lost, a new disenthralment, Sending a root to be fed from the deep original sources, So that the fibres wax till they split the centuried granite? Surely, starting alike at birth from the ignorant Adam, Every type of the race were herein distinctly repeated, Hinted in hopes and desires, and harmless divergence of habit, Save that the law of the common mind is invisibly written Even on our germs, and Life but warms into color the letters. VI Thence, it may be, accustomed to dwell in a moving horizon, Here, alas! the steadfast circle of things is a weary Round of monotonous forms: I am haunted by livelier visions. Linking men and their homes, endowing both with the language, Sweeter than speech, the soul detects in a natural picture, I to my varying moods the fair remembrances summon, Glad that once and somewhere each was a perfect possession. Two will I paint, the forms of the double passion of May-time,— Rest and activity, indolent calm and the sweep of the senses. One, the soft green lap of a deep Dalecarlian valley, Sheltered by piny hills and the distant porphyry mountains; Low and red the house, and the meadow spotted with cattle; All things fair and clear in the light of the midsummer Sabbath, Touching, beyond the steel-blue lake and the twinkle of birch-trees, Houses that nestle like chicks around the motherly church-roof. There, I know, there is innocence, ancient duty and honor, Love that looks from the eye and truth that sits on the forehead, Pure, sweet blood of health, and the harmless freedom of nature, Witless of blame; for the heart is safe in inviolate childhood. Dear is the scene, but it fades: I see, with a leap of the pulses, Tawny under the lidless sun the sand of the Desert, Fiery solemn hills, and the burning green of the date-trees Belting the Nile: the tramp of the curvetting stallions is muffled; Brilliantly stamped on the blue are the white and scarlet of turbans; Lances prick the sky with a starry glitter; the fulness, Joy, and delight of life are sure of the day and the morrow, Certain the gifts of sense, and the simplest order suffices. Breathing again, as once, the perfect air of the Desert. Good it seems to escape from the endless menace of duty, There, where the will is free, and wilfully plays with its freedom, And the lack of will for the evil thing is a virtue. VII Man is more, I have said: but the subject mood is a fashion Wrought of his lighter mind and dyed with the hues of his senses. Then to be truly more, to be verily free, to be master As beseems to the haughty soul that is lifted by knowledge Over the multitude's law, enforcing their own acquiescence,— Lifted to longing and will, in its satisfied loneliness centred,— This prohibits the cry of the nerves, the weak lamentation Shaming my song: for I know whence cometh its languishing burden. Impotent all I have dreamed,—and the calmer vision assures me Such were barren, and vapid the taste of joy that is skin-deep. Better the nest than the wandering wing, the loving possession, Intimate, ever-renewed, than the circle of shallower changes. AUGUST I Dead is the air, and still! the leaves of the locust and walnut Lazily hang from the boughs, inlaying their intricate outlines Rather on space than the sky,—on a tideless expansion of slumber. Faintly afar in the depths of the duskily withering grasses Katydids chirp, and I hear the monotonous rattle of crickets. Dead is the air, and ah! the breath that was wont to refresh me Out of the volumes I love, the heartful, whispering pages, Dies on the type, and I see but wearisome characters only. Therefore be still, thou yearning voice from the garden in Jena,— Still, thou answering voice from the park-side cottage in Weimar,— Still, sentimental echo from chambers of office in Dresden,— Ye, and the feebler and farther voices that sound in the pauses! Each and all to the shelves I return: for vain is your commerce Now, when the world and the brain are numb in the torpor of August. II Over the tasselled corn, and fields of the twice-blossomed clover, Dimly the hills recede in the reek of the colorless hazes: Dull and lustreless, now, the burnished green of the woodlands; Leaves of blackberry briers are bronzed and besprinkled with copper; Weeds in the unmown meadows are blossoming purple and yellow, Roughly entwined, a wreath for the tan and wrinkles of Summer. Where shall I turn? What path attracts the indifferent footstep, Eager no more as in June, nor lifted with wings as in May-time? Whitherward look for a goal, when buds have exhausted their promise, Harvests are reaped, and grapes and berries are waiting for Autumn? Wander, my feet, as ye list! I am careless, to-day, to direct you. Take, here, the path by the pines, the russet carpet of needles Stretching from wood to wood, and hidden from sight by the orchard Here, in the sedge of the slope, the centaury pink, as a sea-shell, Opens her stars all at once, and with finer than tropical spices Sweetens the season's drouth, the censer of fields that are sterile. Now, from the height of the grove, between the irregular tree-trunks, Over the falling fields and the meadowy curves of the valley, Climmer the peaceful farms, the mossy roofs of the houses, Gables gray of the neighboring barns, and gleams of the highway Climbing the ridges beyond to dip in the dream of a forest. III Ah, forsaking the shade, and slowly crushing the stubble, Parting the viscous roseate stems and the keen pennyroyal, Rises a different scene, suggestion of heat and of stillness,— Heat as intense and stillness as dumb, the immaculate ether's Hush when it vaults the waveless Mediterranean sea-floor; Golden the hills of Cos, with pencilled cerulean shadows; Phantoms of Carian shores that are painted and fade in the distance; Patmos behind, and westward the flushed Ariadnean Naxos,— Once as I saw them sleeping, drugged by the poppy of Summer. There, indeed, was the air, as with floating stars of the thistle Filled with impalpable forms, regrets, possibilities, longings, Beauty that was and was not, and Life that was rhythmic and joyous, So that the sun-baked clay the peasant took for his wine-jars Brighter than gold I thought, and the red acidity nectar. Here, at my feet, the clay is clay and a nuisance the stubble, Flaring St. John's-wort, milk-weed, and coarse, unpoetical mullein;— Yet, were it not for the poets, say, is the asphodel fairer? Were not the mullein as dear, had Theocritus sung it, or Bion? Yea, but they did not; and we, whose fancy's tenderest tendrils Shoot unsupported, and wither, for want of a Past we can cling to, We, so starved in the Present, so weary of singing the Future,— What is 't to us, if, haply, a score of centuries later, Milk-weed inspires Patagonian tourists, and mulleins are classic? IV Idly balancing fortunes, feeling the spite of them, maybe,— For the little withheld outweighs the much that is given,— Feeling the pang of the brain, the endless, unquenchable yearning Born of the knowledge of Beauty, not to be shared or imparted, Slowly I stray, and drop by degrees to the thickets of alder Fringing a couch of the stream, a basin of watery slumber. Broken, it seems; for the splash and the drip and the bubbles betoken What?—the bath of a nymph, the bashful strife of a Hylas? Broad is the back, and bent from an un-Olympian stooping, Narrow the loins and firm, the white of the thighs and the shoulders Changing to reddest and toughest of tan at the knees and the elbows. Is it a faun? He sees me, nor cares to hide in the thickets. Faun of the bog is he, a sylvan creature of Galway Come from the ditch below, to cleanse him of sweat and of muck-stain; Willing to give me speech, as, naked, he stands in the shallows. Something of coarse, uncouth, barbaric, he leaves on the bank there; Something of primitive human fairness cometh to clothe him. Were he not bent with the pick, but straightened from reaching the bunches Hung from the mulberry branches,—heard he the bacchanal cymbals, Took from the sun an even gold on the web of his muscles, Knew the bloom of his stunted bud of delight of the senses,— Then as faun or shepherd he might have been welcome in marble. Yea, but he is not; and I, requiring the beautiful balance, Music of life in the body, and limbs too fair to be hidden, Find, indeed, some delicate colors and possible graces,— Moral hints of the man beneath the unsavory garments,— Find them, and sigh, lamenting the law reversed of the races Starting the world afresh on the basis unlovely of Labor. V Was it a spite of fate that blew me hither, an exile, Still unweaned, and not to be weaned, from the milk I was born to? Bitter the stranger's bread to the homesick, hungering palate; Bitterer still to the soul the taste of the food that is foreign! Yet must I take it, yet live, and somehow seem to be healthy, Lest my neighbors, perchance, be shocked by an uncomprehended Violent clamor for that which I crave and they cannot supply me,— Hunger unmeet for the times, anachronistical passions,— Beauty seeming distorted because the rule is distortion. Here is a tangle which, now, too idle am I to unravel. Snared, moreover, by bitter-sweet, moon-seed, and riotous fox-grape, Meshing the thickets: procul, O procul, unpractical fancies! Verily, thus bewildering myself in the maze of æsthetic, Solveless problems, the feet were wellnigh heedlessly fettered. Thoughtless, 't is true, I relinquished my books; but crescit eundo Wisely was said,—for desperate vacancy prompted the ramble, Memories prolonged, and a phantom of logic urges it onward. VI Here are the fields again! The soldierly maize in tassel Stands on review, and carries the scabbarded ears in its arm-pits. Rustling I part the ranks,—the close, engulfing battalions Shaking their plumes overhead,—and, wholly bewildered and heated, Gain the top of the ridge, where stands, colossal, the pin-oak. Yonder, a mile away, I see the roofs of the village,— See the crouching front of the meeting-house of the Quakers, Oddly conjoined with the whittled Presbyterian steeple. Right and left are the homes of the slow, conservative farmers, Loyal people and true, but, now that the battles are over, Zealous for Temperance, Peace, and the Right of Suffrage for Women. Orderly, moral, are they,—at least, in the sense of suppression; Given to preaching of rules, inflexible outlines of duty; Seeing the sternness of life, but, alas! overlooking its graces. Let me be juster: the scattered seeds of the graces are planted Widely apart; but the trumpet-vine on the porch is a token; Yea, and awake and alive are the forces of love and affection, Plastic forces that work from the tenderer models of beauty. Who shall dare to speak of the possible? Who shall encounter Pity and wrath and reproach, recalling the record immortal Left by the races when Beauty was law and Joy was religion? Who to the Duty in drab shall bring the garlanded Pleasure?— Break with the chant of the gods, the gladsome timbrels of morning, Nasal, monotonous chorals, sung by the sad congregation? Better it were to sleep with the owl, to house with the hornet, Than to conflict with the satisfied moral sense of the people. VII Nay, but let me be just; nor speak with the alien language Born of my blood; for, cradled among them, I know them and love them Was it my fault, if a strain of the distant and dead generations Rose in my being, renewed, and made me other than these are? Purer, perhaps, their habit of law than the freedom they shrink from; So, restricted by will, a little indulgence is riot. They, content with the glow of a carefully tempered twilight, Measured pulses of joy, and colorless growth of the senses. Stand aghast at my dream of the sun, and the sound, and the splendor! Mine it is, and remains, resenting the threat of suppression, Stubbornly shaping my life, and feeding with fragments its hunger. Drifted from Attican hills to stray on a Scythian level. So unto me it appears,—unto them a perversion and scandal. VIII Lo! in the vapors, the sun, colossal and crimson and beamless, Touches the woodland; fingers of air prepare for the dew-fall. Life is fresher and sweeter, insensibly toning to softness Needs and desires that are but the broidered hem of its mantle, Not the texture of daily use; and the soul of the landscape, Breathing of justified rest, of peace developed by patience, Lures me to feel the exquisite senses that come from denial, Sharper passion of Beauty never fulfilled in external Forms or conditions, but always a fugitive has-been or may-be. Bright and alive as a want, incarnate it dozes and fattens. Thus, in aspiring, I reach what were lost in the idle possession; Helped by the laws I resist, the forces that daily depress me; Bearing in secreter joy a luminous life in my bosom, Fair as the stars on Cos, the moon on the boscage of Naxos Thus the skeleton Hours are clothed with rosier bodies: Thus the buried Bacchanals rise unto lustier dances: Thus the neglected god returns to his desolate temple: Beauty, thus rethroned, accepts and blesses her children! NOVEMBER I Wrapped in his sad-colored cloak, the Day, like a Puritan, standeth Stern in the joyless fields, rebuking the lingering color,— Dying hectic of leaves and the chilly blue of the asters,— Hearing, perchance, the croak of a crow on the desolate tree-top, Breathing the reek of withered weeds, or the drifted and sodden Splendors of woodland, as whoso piously groaneth in spirit: “Vanity, verily; yea, it is vanity, let me forsake it! Yea, let it fade, for Life is the empty clash of a cymbal, Joy a torch in the hands of a fool, and Beauty a pitfall!” II Once, I remember, when years had the long duration of ages, Came, with November, despair; for summer had vanished forever. Lover of light, my boyish heart as a lover's was jealous, Followed forsaking suns and felt its passion rejected, Saw but Age and Death, in the whole wide circle of Nature Throned forever; and hardly yet have I steadied by knowledge Faith that faltered and patience that was but a weary submission. Though to the right and left I hear the call of the huskers Scattered among the rustling shocks, and the cheerily whistled Lilt of an old plantation tune from an ebony teamster, These behold no more than the regular jog of a mill-wheel Where, unto me, there is possible end and diviner beginning. Silent are now the flute of Spring and the clarion of Summer As they had never been blown: the wail of a dull Miserere Heavily sweeps the woods, and, stifled, dies in the valleys. III Who are they that prate of the sweet consolation of Nature? They who fly from the city's heat for a month to the sea-shore, Drink of unsavory springs, or camp in the green Adirondacks? They, long since, have left with their samples of ferns and of algæ, Memories carefully dried and somewhat lacking in color, Gossip of tree and cliff and wave and modest adventure, Such as a graceful sentiment—not too earnest—admits of, Heard in the pause of a dance or bridging the gaps of a dinner. Nay, but I, who know her, exult in her profligate seasons, Turn from the silence of men to her fancied, fond recognition, I am repelled at last by her sad and cynical humor. Kinder, cheerier now, were the pavements crowded with people, Walls that hide the sky, and the endless racket of business. There a hope in something lifts and enlivens the current, Face seeth face, and the hearts of a million, beating together, Hidden though each from other, at least are outwardly nearer, Lending the life of all to the one,—bestowing and taking, Weaving a common web of strength in the meshes of contact, Close, yet never impeded, restrained, yet delighting in freedom. There the soul, secluded in self, or touching its fellow Only with horny palms that hide the approach of the pulses, Driven abroad, discovers the secret signs of its kindred, Kisses on lips unknown, and words on the tongue of the stranger. Life is set to a statelier march, a grander accordance Follows its multitudinous steps of dance and of battle: Part hath each in the music; even the sacredest whisper Findeth a soul unafraid and an ear that is ready to listen. IV Nature? 'T is well to sing of the glassy Bandusian fountain, Shining Ortygian beaches, or flocks on the meadows of Enna, Linking the careless life with the careless mood of the Mother. We, afar and alone, confronted with heavier questions, Robbed of the oaten pipe before it is warm in our fingers, Why should we feign a faith?—why crown an indifferent goddess? Under the gray, monotonous vault what carolling song-bird Hopes for an echo? Closer and lower the vapors are folded; Sighing shiver the woods, though drifted leaves are unrustled; Ghosts of the grasses that fled with a breath and floated in sunshine Hang unstirred on brier and fence; for a new desolation Comes with the rain, that, chilly and quietly creeping at nightfall, Thence for many a day shall dismally drizzle and darken. V “See!” (methinks I hear the mechanical routine repeated,) “Emblems of faith in the folded bud and the seed that is sleeping!” Knowledge, not Faith, deduced the similitude; how shall an emblem Give to the soul the steadfast truth that alone satisfies it? Joy of the Spring I can feel, but not the preaching of Autumn. Earth, if a lesson is wrought upon each of thy radiant pages, Give us the words that sustain us, and not the words that discourage! Sceptic art thou become, the breeder of doubt and confusion, Powerless vassal of Fate, assuming a meek resignation, Yielding the forces that moved in thy life and made it triumphant! VI Now, as my circle of home is slowly swallowed in darkness, As with the moan of winds the rain is drearily falling,— Hopes that drew as the sun and aims that stood as the pole-star Fading aloof from my life as though it never had known them,— Where, when the wont is deranged, shall I find a permanent foothold? Stripped of the rags of Time I see the form of my being, Born of all that ever has been, and haughtily reaching Forward to all that comes,—yet certain, this moment, of nothing. Chide or condemn as ye may, the truant and mutinous spirit Turns on itself, and forces release from its holiest habit; Soars where the suns are sprinkled in cold illimited darkness, Peoples the spheres with far diviner forms of existence, Questions, conjectures at will; for Earth and its creeds are forgotten. Thousands of æons it gathers, yet scarce its feet are supported; Dumb is the universe unto the secrets of Whence? and of Whither? So, as a dove through the summits of ether falling exhausted, Under it yawns the blank of an infinite Something—or Nothing! VII Let me indulge in the doubt, for this is the token of freedom, This is all that is safe from hands that would fain intermeddle, Thrusting their worn phylacteries over the eyes that are seeking Truth as it shines in the sky, not truth as it smokes in their lantern. Ah, shall I venture alone beyond the limits they set us, Bearing the spark within till a breath of the Deity fan it Into an upward-pointing flame?—and, forever unquiet, Nearer through error advance, and nearer through ignorant yearning? Yes, it must be: the soul from the soul cannot hide or diminish Aught of its essence: here the duplicate nature is ended: Here the illusions recede, at man's unassailable centre. And the nearness and farness of God are all that is left him. VIII Lo! as I muse, there come on the lonely darkness and silence Gleams like those of the sun that reach his uttermost planet, Inwardly dawning; and faint and sweet as the voices of waters Borne from a sleeping moutain-vale on a breeze of the midnight, Falls a message of cheer: “Be calm, for to doubt is to seek whom None can escape, and the soul is dulled with an idle acceptance. Crying, questioning, stumbling in gloom, thy pathway ascendeth; They with the folded hands at the last relapse into strangers. Over thy head, behold! the wing with its measureless shadow Spread against the light, is the wing of the Angel of Unfaith, Chosen of God to shield the eyes of men from His glory. Thus through mellower twilights of doubt thou climbest undazzled, Mornward ever directed, and even in wandering guided. God is patient of souls that reach through an endless creation, So but His shadow be seen, but heard the trail of His mantle!” IX Who is alone in this? The elder brothers, immortal. Leaned o'er the selfsame void and rose to the same consolation, Human therein as we, however diviner their message. Even as the liquid soul of summer, pent in the flagon, Waits in the darksome vault till we crave its odor and sunshine, So in the Past the words of life, the voices eternal. Freedom like theirs we claim, yet lovingly guard in the freedom Sympathies due to the time and help to the limited effort; Thus with double arms embracing our duplicate being, Setting a foot in either world, we stand as the Masters. Ah, but who can arise so far, except in his longing? Give me thy hand!—the soft and quickening life of thy pulses Spans the slackened spirit and lifts the eyelids of Fancy: Doubt is of loneliness born, belief companions the lover. Ever from thee, as once from youth's superfluous forces, Courage and hope are renewed, the endless future created. Out of the season's hollow the sunken sun shall be lifted, Bringing faith in his beams, the green resurrection of Easter, After the robes of death by the angels of air have been scattered, Climbing the heights of heaven, to stand supreme at his solstice! L'ENVOI I May-time and August, November, and over the winter to May-time, Year after year, or shaken by nearness of imminent battle, Or as remote from the stir as an isle of the sleepy Pacific, Here, at least, I have tasted peace in the pauses of labor, Rest as of sleep, the gradual growth of deliberate Nature. Here, escaped from the conflict of taste, the confusion of voices Heard in a land where the form of Art abides as a stranger, Come to me definite hopes and clearer possible duties, Faith in the steadfast service, content with tardy achievement. Here, in men, I have found the elements working as elsewhere, Ever betraying the surge and swell of invisible currents, Which, from beneath, from the deepest bases of thought in the people Press, and heavy with change, and filled with visions unspoken, Bear us onward to shape the formless face of the Future. II Now, if the tree I planted for mine must shadow another's, If the uncounted tender memories, sown with the seasons, Filling the webs of ivy, the grove, the terrace of roses, Clothing the lawn with unwithering green, the orchard with blossoms, Singing a finer song to the exquisite motion of waters, Breathing profounder calm from the dark Dodonian oak-trees, Now must be lost, till, haply, the hearts of others renew them,— Yet we have had and enjoyed, we have and enjoy them forever. Drops from the bough the fruit that here was sunnily ripened: Other will grow as well on the westward slope of the garden. Sorrowing not, nor driven forth by the sword of an angel, Nay, but borne by a fuller tide as a ship from the harbor, Slowly out of our eyes the pastoral bliss of the landscape Fades, and is dim, and sinks below the rim of the ocean. III Sorrowing not, I have said: with thee was the ceasing of sorrow. Hope from thy lips I have drawn, and subtler strength from thy spirit, Sharer of dream and of deed, inflexible conscience of Beauty! Though as a Grace thou art dear, as a guardian Muse thou art earnest, Walking with purer feet the paths of song that I venture, Side by side, unwearied, in cheerful, encouraging silence. Not thy constant woman's heart alone I have wedded; One are we made in patience and faith and high aspiration. Thus, at last, the light of the fortunate age is recovered: Thus, wherever we wander, the shrine and the oracle follow! LARS: A PASTORAL OF NORWAY TO JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER Through many years my heart goes back, Through checkered years of loss and gain, To that fair landmark on its track, When first, beside the Merrimack, Upon thy cottage roof I heard the autumn rain. A hand that welcomed and that cheered To one unknown didst thou extend; Thou gavest hope to Song that feared; But now, by Time and Faith endeared, I claim the sacred right to call the Poet, Friend! However Life the stream may stain, From thy pure fountain drank my youth The simple creed, the faith humane In Good, that never can be slain, The prayer for inward Light, the search for outward Truth! Like thee, I see at last prevail The sleepless soul that looks above; I hear, far off, the hymns that hail The Victor, clad in heavenly mail, Whose only weapons are the eyes and voice of Love! Take, then, these olive leaves from me, To mingle with thy brighter bays! Some balm of peace and purity, In them, may faintly breathe of thee; And take the grateful love, wherein I hide thy praise! BOOK I On curtained eyes, and bosoms warm with rest, On slackened fingers and unburdened feet, On limbs securer slumber held from toil, While nimble spirits of the busy blood Renewed their suppleness, yet filled the trance With something happy which was less than dream, The sun of Sabbath rose. Two hours, afar, Behind the wintry peaks of Justedal, Unmarked, he climbed; then, pausing on the crest Of Fille Fell, he gathered up his beams Dissolved in warmer blue, and showered them down Between the mountains, through the falling vale, On Ulvik's cottages and orchard trees. And one by one the chimneys breathed; the sail That loitered lone along the misty fiord Flashed like a star, and filled with fresher wind; The pasturing steers, dispersed on grassy slopes, Raised heads of wonder over hedge and wall To call, unanswered, the belated cows; And ears that would not hear, or heard in dreams, The lark's alarum over idle fields, And lids, still sweetly shut, that else unclosed At touch of daybreak, yielded to the day. Then, last of all, among the maidens, met To dip fresh faces in the chilly fount, And smoothen braids of sleep-entangled hair, Came Brita, glossy as a mating bird. No need had she to stoop and wash awake Her drowsy senses: air and water kissed A face as bright and breathing as their own, In joy of life and conscious loveliness. If still her mirror's picture stayed with her, A memory, whispering how the downcast lid Shaded the flushing fairness of her cheek, And hinting how a straying lock relieved The rigid fashion of her hair, or how The curve of slightly parted lips became Half-sad, half-smiling, either meaning much Or naught, as wilful humor might decide,— Yet thence was born the grace she could not lose: Her beauty, guarded, kept her beautiful. “Wilt soon be going, Brita?” Ragnil asked: “And which the way,—by fiord or over fell?” “Why, both!” another laughed; “or else the rocks Will split and slide beneath the feet of Lars, Or Per will meet the Kraken!” Brita held One dark-brown braid between her teeth, and wove The silken twine and tassels through its fringe, Before she spake; but first she seemed to sigh: “I will not choose; you shall not spoil my day! All paths are free that lead across the fell; All wakes are free to keels upon the fiord, And even so my will: come Lars or Per, Come Erik, Anders, Harald, Olaf, Nils, Come sœter-boys, or sailors from the sea, No lass is bound to slight a decent lad, Or walk behind him when the way is wide.” “No way is wide enough for three, I've heard,” Said Ragnil, “save there be two men that prop A third, when market 's over.” “Go your ways!” Then Brita cried: “if two or twelve should come, I call them not, nor do I bid them go: A friendly word is no betrothal ring.” Then tossed she back her braids, and with them tossed Her wilful head. “Why, take you both, or all!” She said, and left them, adding, “if you can!” With silent lips, nor cared what prudent fears, Old-fashioned wisdom, dropped in parrot-words, Chattered behind her as she climbed the lane. Along her path the unconverted bees Set toil to music, and the elder-flowers Bent o'er the gate a snowy entrance-arch, Where, highest on the slope, her cottage sat. Her bed of pinks there yielded to the sun Its clove and cinnamon odors; sheltered there Beneath the eaves, a rose-tree nursed its buds, And through the door, across the dusk within, She saw her grandam set the morning broth And cut a sweeter loaf. All breathed of peace, Of old, indulgent love, and simple needs, Yet Brita sighed,—then blushed because she sighed. “Dear Lord!” the ancient dame began, “'tis just The day, the sun, the breeze, the smell of flowers, As fifty years ago, in Hallingdal, When I, like thee, picked out my smartest things, And put them on, half guessing what would hap, And found my luck before I took them off. See! thou shalt wear the brooch, my mother's then, And thine when I am gone. Some luck, who knows? May still be shining in the fair red stone.” So, from a box that breathed of musky herbs, She took the boss of roughly fashioned gold, With garnets studded: took, but gave not yet. Some pleasure in the smooth, cool touch of gold, Or wine-red sparkles, flickering o'er the stones, Or dream of other fingers, other lips That kissed them for the bed they rocked upon That happy summer eve in Hallingdal, Gave her slow heart its girlhood's pulse again, Her cheek one last leaf of its virgin rose. Oh, foolishness of age! She dared not say What then she felt: Go, child, enjoy the bliss Of innocent woman, ripe for need of man, And needing him no less! Some natural art Will guide thy guileless fancies, some pure voice Will whisper truth, and lead thee to thy fate! But, ruled by ancient habit, counselled thus: “Be on thy guard, my Brita! men are light Of tongue, and unto faces such as thine Mean not the half they say: the girl is prized Who understands their ways, and holds them off Till he shall come, who, facing her, as she And death were one, pleads for his life with her: When such an one thou meetest, thou wilt know.” “Nay, grandam!” Brita said! “I will not hear A voice so dreadful-earnest: I am young, And I can give and take, not meaning much, Nor over-anxious to seem death to men: I like them all, and they are good to me. I'll wear thy brooch, and may it bring me luck, Not such as thine was, as I guess it was, But, in the kirk, short sermon, cheerful hymn, Good neighbors on the way, and for the dance A light-foot partner!” With a rippling laugh That brushed the surface of her heart, and hid Whatever doubt its quiet had betrayed, She kissed the withered cheek, and on her breast Pinned the rough golden boss with wine-red stones. “Come, Brita, come!” rang o'er the elder-flowers: “I come!” she answered, threw her fleeting face Upon the little mirror, took her bunch Of feathered pinks, and joined the lively group Of Sundayed lads and lasses in the lane. They set themselves to climb the stubborn fell By stony stairs that left the fields below, And ceased, far up, against the nearer blue. But lightly sprang the maids; and where the slides Of ice ground smooth the slanting planes of rock, Strong arms drew up and firm feet steadied theirs. Here lent the juniper a prickly hand, And there they grasped the heather's frowsy hair, While jest and banter made the giddy verge Secure as orchard-turf; and none but showed The falcon's eye that guides the hunter's foot, Till o'er their flushed and breathless faces struck The colder ether; on the crest they stood, And sheltered vale and ever-winding fiord Sank into gulfs of shadow, while afar To eastward many a gleaming tooth of snow Cut the full round of sky. “Why, look you, now!” Cried one: “the fiord is bare as threshing-floor When winter 's over: what 's become of Per?” “And what of Lars?” asked Ragnil, with a glance At Brita's careless face; “can he have climbed The Evil Pass, and crossed the thundering foss, His nearest way?” As clear as blast of horn There came a cry, and on the comb beyond They saw the sparkle of a scarlet vest. Then, like the echo of a blast of horn, A moment later, fainter and subdued, A second cry; and far to left appeared A form that climbed and leaped, and nearer strove. And Harald, Anders Ericssen, and Nils Set their free voices to accordant pitch And shouted one wild call athwart the blue, Until it seemed to quiver: as they ceased The maids began, and, moving onward, gave Strong music: all the barren summits rang. So from the shouts and girlish voices grew The wayward chorus of a sœter-song, Such as around the base of Skagtolstind The chant of summer-jötun seems, when all The herds are resting and the herdsmen meet; And while it swept with swelling, sinking waves The crags and ledges, Lars had joined the band, And from the left came Per; and Brita walked Between them where the path was broad, but when It narrowed to such track as tread the sheep Round slanting shoulder and o'er rocky spur To reach the rare, sweet herbage, one went close Before her, one behind, and unto both With equal cheer and equal kindliness Her speech was given: so both were glad of heart. A herdsman, woodman, hunter, Lars was strong, Yet silent from his life upon the hills. Beneath dark lashes gleamed his darker eyes Like mountain-tarns that take their changeless hue From shadows of the pine: in all his ways He showed that quiet of the upper world A breath can turn to tempest, and the force Of rooted firs that slowly split the stone. But Per was gay with laughter of the seas Which were his home: the billow breaking blue On the Norwegian skerries flashed again Within his sunbright eyes; and in his tongue, Set to the louder, merrier key it learned In hum of rigging, roar of wind and tide, The rhythm of ocean and its wilful change Allured all hearts as ocean lures the land. Now which, this daybreak with his yellow locks, Or yonder twilight, calm, mysterious, filled With promise of its stars, shall turn the mind Of the light maiden who is neither fain To win nor lose, since, were the other not, Then each were welcome?—how should maid decide? For that the passion of the twain was marked, And haply envied, and a watch was set, She would be strong: and, knowing, seem as though She nothing knew, until occasion came To bid her choose, or teach her how to choose. On each and all the soberness of morn Yet lay, the weight of hard reality That even clogs the callow wings of love; And now descending, where the broader vale Showed farm on farm, and groves of birch and oak, And fields that shifted gloss like shimmering silk, The kirk-bells called them through the mellow air, Slow-swinging, till, as from a censer's cup The smoke diffused makes all the minster sweet, The peace they chimed pervaded earth and sky. As under foliage of the lower land The pathway led, more harmless fell the jest, The laugh less frequent: then the maidens drew Apart, set smooth their braids, their kirtles shook, And grave, decorous as a troop of nuns, Entered the little town. Ragnil alone And Anders Ericssen together walked, For twice already had their banns been called. Lars shot one glance at Brita, as to say: “Were thou and I thus promised, side by side!” Then looked away; but Per, who kept as near As decent custom let, all softly sang: “Forget me thou, I shall remember still!” That she might hear him, and so not forget. Thus onward to the gray old kirk they moved. The bells had ceased to chime: the hush within With holy shuddering from the organ-bass Was filled, and when it died the prayer arose. Then came another stillness, as the Lord Were near, or bent to listen from afar, And last the text; but Brita found it strange. Thus read the pastor: “Set me as a seal Upon thy heart, yea, set me as a seal Upon thine arm; for love is strong as death, And jealousy is cruel as the grave.” She felt the garnets burn upon her breast, As if all fervor of the olden love Still heated them, and fire of jealousy, And to herself she thought: “Has any face Looked on me with a love as strong as death? But I am Life, and how am I to know?” Then, straightway weary of the puzzle, she Began to wander with her dancing thoughts Out o'er the fell, and up and down the slopes Of sunny grass, while ever and anon The preacher's solemn voice struck through her dream, Its sound a menace and its sense unknown. Then she was sad, and vexed that she was sad, And vexed with them who only could have caused Her sadness: “Grandam's luck, forsooth!” she thought: “If one were luck, why, two by rights were more, But two a plague, a lesser plague were one, And not a fortune!” So, till service ceased, And all arose when benediction came, She mused with pettish thrust of under lip, Nor met the yearning eyes of Lars and Per. The day's grave duty done, forth issued all, Foregathering with the Vossevangen youth, The girls of Graven and the boys of Vik, Where under elms before the guest-house front Stood tables brown with age: already bore The host his double-handed bunch of cans Fresh-filled and foaming; and the cry of Skoal! Mixed with the clashing kiss of glassy lips. But when in gown of black the pastor came, All rose, respectful, waiting for his words. A pace in front stood Anders Ericssen, Undignified in bridegroom dignity, Because too conscious: Ragnil blushed with shame, And all the maidens envied her the shame, When reverend fingers tapped her cheek, and he, That good man, said: “How fares my bonny bride? She must not be the last this summer; look, My merry lads, what harvest waits for you!” And on the maidens turned his twinkling eyes, That beamed a blessing with the playful words. Then Lars slipped nearer Brita, where she stood Withdrawn a little, underneath the trees. “You heard the pastor,” said he; “would you next Put on the crown? not you the harvest, nay, The reaper, rather; and the grain is ripe.” “A field,” she answered, “may be ripe enough When half the heads are empty, and the stalks Are choked with cockle. I've no mind to reap. Indeed, I know not what you mean: the speech The pastor uses suits not you nor me.” She meant reproof, yet made reproof so sweet By feigned impatience, which betrayed itself, That Lars bent lower, murmured with quick breath: “Oh, take my meaning, Brita! Give me one,— But one small word to say that you are kind, But one kind word to tell me you are free, And I not wholly hateful!” “Lars!” she cried, Her frank, sweet sympathy aroused, “not so! As friendly-kind as I can be, I am, But free of you, and all; and that's enough! You men would walk across the growing grain, And trample it because it is not ripe Before the harvest.” Thereupon she smiled, Sent him one dewy glance that should have been Defiant, but a promise seemed; then turned, And hastening, almost brushed the breast of Per. He caught her by the hands, that Viking's son, Whose fathers wore the eagle-helm, and stood With Frithiof at the court of Angantyr, Or followed fair-haired Harald to the East, Though fishing now but herring, cod, and bass, Not men and merchant-galleys: he was red With mead, no less than sun and briny air: He caught her by the hands, and said, as one Who gives command and means to be obeyed: “You'll go to Ulvik, Brita, by the fiord! Björn brings my boat; the wind is off the sea, But light as from a Bergen lady's fan: Say, then, you'll go!” The will within his words Struck Brita harshly. For a moment she Pondered refusal, then, with brightening face Turned suddenly, and cried to all the rest: “How fine of Per! we need not climb the fell: He'll bear us all to Ulvik by the fiord; Björn brings his boat; the wind is off the sea!” And all the rest, with roaring skoal to Per, Struck hands upon the offer; only he For plan so friendly showed a face too grim. He set his teeth and muttered: “Caught this time, But she shall pay it!” till his discontent Passed, like a sudden squall that tears the sea, Yet leaves a sun to smile the billows down. His jovial nature, bred to change, was swayed By the swift consequence of Brita's whim, The grasp of hand, the clap of shoulder, clink Of brimming glass, and whispers overheard Of “Luck to Per, and Björn, and all the boys That reap, but sow not, on the rolling fields!” And Brita, too, no sooner punished him Than she relented, and would fain appease; Whence, fluttering to and fro, she kept the plan Alive, yet made its kindness wholly Per's: Only, when earnestly to Lars she said: “You'll go with us?” he answered sullenly: “I will not go: my way is o'er the fell.” He did not quit them till they reached the strand, And on the stern-deck and the prow was piled The bright, warm freight; then chose a dangerous path, A rocky ladder slanting up the crags, And far aloft upon a foreland took His seat, with chin upon his clenching hands, To watch and muse, in love and hate, alone. But they slid off upon a wind that filled The sail, yet scarcely heeled the boat a-lee: They seemed to rest above a hanging sky 'Twixt shores that went and shores that slowly came In silence, and the larger shadows fell From heaven-high walls, a darker clearness in The air above, the firmament below, Crossed by the sparkling creases of the sea. Björn at the helm and Per to watch the wind, They scarcely sailed, but soared as eagle soars O'er Gousta's lonely peak with moveless plumes, That, level-set, cut the blue planes of air; And out of stillness rose that sunset hymn Of Sicily, the O sanctissima! That swells and fluctuates like a sleepy wave. Thus they swam on to where the fiord is curved Around the cape, where through a southward cleft Some wicked sprite sends down his elfish flaws. So now it chanced: the vessel sprang, and leaned Before the sudden strain; but Per and Björn Held the hard bit upon their flying steed, And laughing, sang: “Out on the billows blue You needs must dance, and on the billows blue You sleep, a babe, rocked by the billows blue!” As suddenly the gust was over: then Found Per a seat by Brita. “Did you fear?” He said; and she: “Who fears that sails with Per?” “Nay then,” he whispered, “never fear me more, As twice to-day: why give me all this freight, When so much less were so much more to me?” “Since when were maidens free as fishermen? Not since the days of Brynhild, I believe;” She answered, sharply: “I was fain to sail, And place for me meant place for more beside.” “Not in my heart,” he said; “it holds and keeps Thee only; thou canst not escape my love;” And tried to take her hand: she bending o'er The low, black bulwarks, saw a crimson spark Drop on the surface of the pale-green wave, And sink, surrounded by a golden gleam. “Oh, grandam's brooch!” she cried, and started up, Sat down again, and hid her face, and wept. Some there lamented as the loss were theirs, Some shook their heads in ominous dismay, But all agreed that, save a fish should bring The jewel in its maw (and tales declared The thing once happened), none would see it more. Said Guda Halstensdatter: “I should fear An evil, had I lost it.” Thorkil cried: “Be silent, Guda! Loss is grief enough For Brita: would you frighten her as well? There 's many think that jewels go and come, Having some life or virtue of their own That drives them from us or that brings them back. 'T was so with my great-grandam's wedding-ring.” “Now, how was that?” all asked; and Thorkil spake: “Why, not a year had she been wedded, when The ring was gone: how, where, a mystery. It was a bitter grief, but nothing happed Save losses, ups and downs, that come to all; Both took their lot in patience and in hope, And worked the harder when the luck was least. So from the moorland and the stony brake They won fresh fields; and now, when came around The thirteenth harvest, and the grain was ripe On that new land, my grandsire, then a boy, One morn came leaping, shouting, from the field. High in his hand he held a stalk of wheat, And round the ripened ear, between the beards, Hung, like a miracle, the wedding-ring! And father heard great-grandam say it shone So wonderful, she dropped upon her knees; She thought God's finger touched it, giving back. Who knows what fish may pounce on Brita's brooch Before it reach the bottom of the fiord, And then, what fisher net the fish?” Some there Began to smile at this, and Per's blue eyes Danced with a cheerful light, as, in the cove Of Ulvik entered, fell his sagging sail. No more spake Brita; homeward up the hill She walked alone, sobbing with grief and dread. The world goes round: the sun sets on despair, The morrow makes it hope. Each little life Thinks the great axle of the universe Turns on its fate, and finds impertinence In joy or grief conflicting with its own. Yet fate is woven from unnoted threads; Each life is centred in the life of all, And from the meanest root some fibre runs Which chance or destiny may intertwine With those that feed a force or guiding thought, To rule the world: so goes the world around. And Brita's loss, that made all things seem dark, Was soon outgrieved: came Anders' wedding-day And Ragnil's, and the overshining joy Of these two hearts from others drove the shade. Forth from her home the ruddy bride advanced, Not fair, but made so by her bridal bliss, The tall crown on her brow, and in her hand The bursting nosegay: Anders, washed and sleeked With ribbons on his hat, from head to foot Conscious of all he wore, each word he spake, And every action for the day prescribed, Stuck to her side. It was a trying time; But when the strange truth was declared at last That they were man and wife, so greeted with The cries of flute and fiddle, crack of guns, And tossing of the blossom-brightened hats, They breathed more freely; and the guests were glad That this was over, since the festival Might now begin, and mirth be lord of all. In Ragnil's father, Halfdan's home, the casks Of mead were tapped, the Dantzig brandy served In small old glasses, and the platters broad, Heaped high with salmon, cheese, and caviar, Tempted and soothed before the heavier meal. No guest in duty failed; and Per began— The liquor's sting, the day's infection warm Upon his blood—to fix his sweetheart's word, Before some wind should blow it otherwhere. Your hand, my Brita,” stretching his,—“your hand For all the dances: see, my heels are light! I have a right to ask you for amends, But ask it as a kindness.” “Nay,” she said, “You have no right; but I will dance one dance With you, as any other.” “Will you then?” He cried, and caught her sharply by the wrist: “I'll not be ‘any other,’ do you hear? I'll be the one, the only one, whose foot Keeps time with yours, my heart the tune thereto!” Then shouting comrades whirled him from her side, And Ragnil called the maids, to show her stores Of fine-spun linen, lavendered and cool In nutwood chests, her bed and canopy Painted with pictures of the King and Queen, And texts from Scripture, o'er the pillows curled Where she and Anders should that night repose. They shut the door to keep the lads without, Then shyly stole away; and Brita found Alone, among the garden bushes, Lars. His eyes enlarged and brightened as she came; He said, in tones whose heartful sweetness made Her pulses thrill: “I will not bind you yet: Dance only first with me that sœter-dance You learned on Graafell: Nils will play the air. Then take your freedom, favor whom you will. I shall not doubt you, now and evermore.” “But, Lars”—she said, then paused; he would not wait: The mirthful guests drew near. “I'll keep you, then,” He whispered; “till I needs must let you go. This much will warm me on the windy fells, Make sunshine of the mists, melt frost in dew, And paint the rocks with roses.” Could she turn From that brave face, those calm, confiding eyes? Could she, in others' sight, reject the hand Now leading to the board? If so, too late Decision came, for she had followed him, And sat beside him when the horns of mead Made their slow pilgrimage from mouth to mouth, And while the stacks of bread sank low, the haunch Of stall-fed ox diminished to the bone, Till multeberries, Bergen gingerbread, With wine of Spain, made daintier end of all. Then, like a congress of the blackbirds, held In ancient tree-tops on October eves, The tables rang and clattered; but, erelong, Brisk hands had stripped them bare, and, turning down The leaves, made high-backed settles by the wall. Through all the bustle and the din were heard The fiddle-strings of Nils, as one by one They chirped and squeaked in dolorous complaint, Until the bent ear and the testing bow Found them accordant: then a flourish came That scampered up and down the scale, and lapsed In one long note that hovered like a bird, Uncertain where to light; but so not long: It darted soon, a lark above the fells, And spun in eddying measures. Here a pair, And there another, took the vacant floor, Then Lars and Brita, sweeping in the dance That whirled and paused, as if a mountain gust Blew them together, tossed, and tore apart. And ever, when the wild refrain came round, Lars flung himself and sidewards turned in air, Yet missed no beat of music when he fell. “By holy Olaf!” gray-haired Halfdan cried: “There 's not a trick we knew in good old days, But he has caught it: so I danced myself.” Upon the sweeping circles entered Per, Held back, at first, and partially controlled By them who saw the current of his wrath, And whitherward it set; but now, when slacked The fiery pulses of the dance, he broke Through all, and rudely thrust himself on Lars. “Your place belongs to me,” he hoarsely cried,— “Your place and partner!” “Brita's free to choose,” Said Lars, “and may be bidden; but this floor Is not your deck, nor are you captain mine: I think your throat has made your head forget.” Lars spake the truth that most exasperates: His words were oil on flame, and Per resolved, So swayed by reckless anger, to defy Then, once, and wholly. “Deck or not,” said he, “You know what right I mean: you stand where I Allow you not: I warn you off the field!” Lars turned to Brita: “Does he speak for you?” She shook her head, but what with shame and fear Said nothing: “We have danced our sœter-dance,” He further spake, “and now I go: when next We meet at feast, I claim another such.” “Aye, claim it, claim!” Per shouted; “but you'll first Try knives with me, for blood shall run between Your words and will: where you go, I shall be.” “So be it: bid your mother bring your shroud!” Lars answered; and he left the marriage house. The folk of Ulvik knew, from many a tale Of feud and fight, from still transmitted hates And old Berserker madness in their blood, What issue hung: but whoso came between Marked that the mediation dwelt with her Who stood between: if she would choose, why then, The lover foiled forsooth must leave in peace The lover favored,—further strife were vain. But Lars was far upon the windy heights, And Per beyond the skerries on the sea, And Ragnil bustling busy as a wife, That might have helped; while those to Brita came, More meddlesome than kind, who hurt each nerve They touched for healing. What could she, but cry In tears and anger: “Shall I seek them out, Bestow myself on one, take pride for love, And forfeit thus all later pride in me? Rather refuse them both, and on myself Turn hate of both: their knives, i' faith! were dull Beside your cutting tongues!” She vowed, indeed, In moonlit midnights, when she could not sleep, And either window framed a rival face, That seemed to wait, with set, reproachful eyes, To smile on neither, hold apart and off Their fatal kindness. She repel, that drew? As if an open rose could will away Its hue and scent, a lily arm its stem With thorns, a daisy turn against the sun! The fields were reaped; the longer shadows thrown From high Hardanger and the eastern range Began to chill the vales: it was the time When on the meadow by the lonely lake Of Graven, from the regions round about The young men met to hold their wrestling-match, As since the days of Olaf they had done. There, too, the maids came and the older folk, Delighting in the grip of strength and skill, The strain of sinew, stubbornness of joint, And urge of meeting muscles. All the place Was thronged, and loud the cheers and laughter rang When some old champion from a rival vale Bent before fresher arms, and from his base Wrenched ere he knew, fell heavily to earth. Until the sun across the fir-trees laid His lines of level gold, they watched the bouts; Then strayed by twos and threes toward the sound Of wassail in the houses and the booths. And Brita with her Ulvik gossips went. Once only, when a Lærdal giant brought Sore grief upon the men of Vik, she saw Or seemed to see, beyond the stormy ring, The shape of Lars; but, scarce disquieted If it were he, or if the twain were there, (Since blood, she thought, must surely cool in time,) She followed to the house upon the knoll Where ever came and went like bees about Their hive's low doorway, groups of merry folk. A mellow dusk already filled the room; The chairs were pushed aside, and on the stove, As on a throne of painted clay, sat Nils. Behold! Lars waited there; and as she reached The inner circle round the dancing-floor He moved to meet her, and began to say “Thanks for the last”—when from the other side Strode Per. The two before her, face to face Stared at each other: Brita looked at them. All three were pale; and she, with faintest voice, Remembering counsel of the tongues unkind, Could only breathe: “I know not how to choose.” “No need!” said Lars: “I choose for you,” said Per. Then both drew off and threw aside their coats, Their broidered waistcoats, and the silken scarves About their necks; but Per growled “All!” and made His body bare to where the leathern belt Is clasped between the breast-bone and the hip. Lars did the same; then, setting tight the belts, Both turned a little; the low daylight clad Their forms with awful fairness, beauty now Of life, so warm and ripe and glorious, yet So near the beauty terrible of Death. All saw the mutual sign, and understood; And two stepped forth, two men with grizzled hair And earnest faces, grasped the hooks of steel In either's belt, and drew them breast to breast, And in the belts made fast each other's hooks. An utter stillness on the people fell While this was done: each face was stern and strange And Brita, powerless to turn her eyes, Heard herself cry, and started: “Per, O Per!” When those two backward stepped, all saw the flash Of knives, the lift of arms, the instant clench Of hands that held and hands that strove to strike: All heard the sound of quick and hard-drawn breath, And naught beside; but sudden red appeared, Splashed on the white of shoulders and of arms. Then, thighs entwined, and all the body's force Called to the mixed resistance and assault, They reeled and swayed, let go the guarding clutch, And struck out madly. Per drew back, and aimed A deadly blow, but Lars embraced him close, Reached o'er his shoulder and from underneath Thrust upward, while upon his ribs the knife, Glancing, transfixed the arm. A gasp was heard: The struggling limbs relaxed; and both, still bound Together, fell upon the bloody floor. Some forward sprang, and loosed, and lifted them A little; but the head of Per hung back, With lips apart and dim blue eyes unshut, And all the passion and the pain were gone Forever. “Dead!” a voice exclaimed; then she, Like one who stands in darkness, till a blaze Of blinding lightning paints the whole broad world, Saw, burst her stony trance, and with a cry Of love and grief and horror, threw herself Upon his breast, and kissed his passive mouth, And loud lamented: “Oh, too late I know I love thee best, my Per, my sweetheart Per! Thy will was strong, thy ways were masterful; I did not guess that love might so command! Thou wert my ruler: I resisted thee, But blindly: Oh, come back!—I will obey.” Within the breast of Lars the heart beat on, Yet faintly, as a wheel more slowly turns When summer drouth has made the streamlet thin. They staunched the gushing life; they raised him up, And sense came back and cleared his clouded eye At Brita's voice. He tried to stretch his hand: “Where art thou, Brita? It is time to choose: Take what is left of him or me!” He paused: She did not answer. Stronger came his voice: “I think that I shall live: forget all this! 'T was not my doing, shall not be again, If only thou wilt love me as I love.” “I love thee?” Brita cried; “who murderest him I loved indeed! Why should I wish thee life, Except to show thee I can hate instead?” A groan so deep, so desperate and sad Came from his throat, that men might envy him Who lay so silent; then they bore him forth, While others smoothed the comely limbs of Per. His mother, next, unrolled the decent shroud She brought with her, as ancient custom bade, To do him honor: for man's death he died, Not shameful straw-death of the sick and old. BOOK II Lars lived, because the life within his frame Refused to leave it; but his heart was dead, He thought, for nothing moved him any more. He spake not Brita's name, and every path Where he had scattered fancies of the maid Like seeds of flowers, but whence, instead, had grown Malignant briers, to clog and tear his feet, Was hated now: so, all that once seemed life, So bright with power and purpose, rich in chance, And dropping rest from every cloud of toil, Became a weariness of empty days. Thus, not to 'scape the blood-revenge for Per Which Thorsten vowed, his brother: not to shun The tongues and eyes of censure or reproach, Or spoken pity, angering more than these; But since each rock upon the lonely fell Kept echoes of her voice, each cleft of blue Where valleys wandered downward to the wave Held shadows of her form, each meadow-sod Her footprints,—all the land so filled with her, Once hope, delight, but desolation now,— Forth must he go, beyond his father's hearth, Beyond the vales, beyond the teeth of snow, The shores and skerries, till the world become Too wide for knowledge of his evil fate, Too strange for memory of his ruined love! He recked not where; but into passive moods Some spirit drops a leaven, to point anew Men's aimless forces. Was it only chance That now recalled a long-forgotten tale? How Leif, his mother's grandsire, crossed the seas To those new lands the great Gustavus claimed: How, in The Key of old Calmàr, their ship, A trooper he, with Printz the Governor, Sailed days and weeks; the blue would never turn To shallower green, and landsmen moped in dread, Till shores grew up they scarce believed were such, Low-lying, fresh, as if the hand of God Had lately finished them. But farther on The curving bay to one broad river led, Where cabins nestled on their rising banks, With mighty woods, and mellow intervales, Inviting corn and cattle. Then rejoiced The Swedish farmers, and were set ashore: But on the level isle of Tinicum Printz built a fort, and there the trooper, Leif, Abode three years: and he was fain to tell, When wounds and age had crippled him, how fair And fruitful was the land, how full of sun And bountiful in streams,—and pity 't was The strong Norse blood could not have stocked it all! Lars knew not why these stories should return To haunt his gloomy brain: but it was so, And on the current of his memory launched His thought, and followed; then neglected will Awoke, and on the track of thought embarked, And soon his life was borne away from all It knew, and burst the adamantine ring Which bound its world within the greater world. As one who, wandering by the water-side, Steps in an empty boat, and sits him down, Not knowing that his step has loosed the chain, And drifts away, unwitting, on the tide, So he was drifted: no farewell he spake, But happy Ulvik and the fiord and fell Passed from his eyes, and underneath his feet The world went round, until he found himself, Like one aroused from sleep, upon the hills That roll, the heavings of the boundless blue. As unto Leif, his mother's grandsire, so To him it seemed the blue would never turn To shallower green, till shining fisher-sails Came, stars of land that rose before the land; Then fresher shores and climbing river-banks, And broken woods and mellow intervales, With houses, corn, and cattle. There, perchance, He dreamed, the memory of Leif might bide Upon the level isle of Tinicum, Or farms of Swedish settlers: if 't were so, One stone was laid whereon to build a home. But when the vessel at the city's wharf Dropped anchor, and the bright new land was won, The high red houses and the sober throngs Were strange to him, and strange the garb and speech. A while he lingered there; until, outgrown The tongue's first blindness and the stranger's shame, His helpless craft was turned again to use. Then sought he countrymen, and, finding now Within the Swedish Church at Weccacoe No Norse but in the features, else all changed, He left and wandered down the Delaware Unto the isle of Tinicum; and there Of all that fortress of the valiant Printz Some yellow bricks remained. The name of Leif Who should remember? Do we call to mind, Years afterward, the clover-head we plucked Some morn of June, and smelled, and threw away? But when we find a life erased and lost Beneath the multitude's unsparing feet,— A life so clearly beating yet for us In blood and memory,—comes a sad surprise: So Lars went onward, losing hope of good, To where, upon her hill, fair Wilmington Looks to the river over marshy meads. He saw the low brick church, with stunted tower, The portal-arches, ivied now and old, And passed the gate: lo! there, the ancient stones Bore Norland names and dear, familiar words! It seemed the dead a comfort spake: he read, Thrusting the nettles and the vines aside, And softly wept: he knew not why he wept, But here was something in the strange new land That made a home, though growing out of graves. Led by a faith that rest could not be far, Beyond the town, where deeper vales bring down The winding brooks from Pennsylvanian hills, He walked: the ordered farms were fair to see And fair the peaceful houses: old repose Mellowed the lavish newness of the land, And sober toil gave everywhere the right To simple pleasures. As by each he passed, A spirit whispered: “No, not there!” and then His sceptic heart said: “Never anywhere!” The sun was low, when, with the valley's bend, There came a change. Two willow-fountains flung And showered their leafy streams before a house Of rusty stone, with chimneys tall and white; A meadow stretched below; and dappled cows, Full-fed, were waiting for their evening call. The garden lay upon a sunny knoll, An orchard dark behind it, and the barn, With wide, warm wings, a giant mother-bird, Seemed brooding o'er its empty summer nest. Then Lars upon the roadside bank sat down, For here was peace that almost seemed despair, So near his eyes, so distant from his life It lay: and while he mused, a woman came Forth from the house, no servant-maid more plain In her attire, yet, as she nearer drew, Her still, sweet face, and pure, untroubled eyes Spake gentle blood. A browner dove she seemed, Without the shifting iris of the neck, And when she spake her voice was like a dove's, Soft, even-toned, and sinking in the heart. Lars could not know that loss and yearning made His eyes so pleading; he but saw how hers Bent on him as some serious angel's might Upon a child, strayed in the wilderness. She paused, and said: “Thou seemest weary, friend,” But he, instead of answer, clasped his hands. The silent gesture wrought upon her mind. She marked the alien face; then, with a smile That meant and made excuse for needful words, She said: “Perhaps thou dost not understand?” “I understand,” Lars answered; “you are good. Indeed, I'm weary: not in hands and feet, But tired of idly owning them. I see A thousand fields where I could take my bread Nor stint the harvest, and a thousand roofs That shelter corners where my head might rest, Nor steal another's pillow!” As to seek The meaning of his words, she mused a space. In that still land of homes, how should she guess What fancies haunt a homeless heart? Yet his Was surely need: so, presently, she spake: “Work only waits, I've thought, for willing hands; A meal and shelter for the night, we give To all that ask; what more is possible Rests with my father.” Lars arose and went Beside her, where the cows came loitering on With udders swelled, and meadow-scented breath, Through opened bars and up the grassy lane. “Ho, Star!” and “Pink!” he called them coaxingly In soft Norse words: they stared as if they knew. “See, lady!” then he cried: “the honest things Like him that likes them, over all the world.” But “Nay,” she said, “not ‘lady’!—call me Ruth: My father's name is Ezra Mendenhall, And hither comes he: I will speak for thee.” So Lars was sheltered, and when evening fell, And all, around the clean and peaceful board, Kept the brief silence which is fittest prayer Before the bread is broken, he was filled With something calm which was akin to peace, With something restless, which was almost hope. The white-haired man with placid forehead sat And faced him, grave as any Bergen judge, Yet kindly; he the stranger's claim allowed, And ample space for hunger, ere he spake: “What, then, might be thy name?” “My name is Lars, The son of Thorsten, in the Norway land. My father said the blood of heathen kings Runs in our veins, but we are Christian men, Who work the more because of idle sires, And speak the truth, and try to live good lives.” Lars ceased, as if a blow had closed his mouth, But Ezra said: “The name sounds heathenish, Indeed, yet hardly royal; blood is naught to us, Yea, less than naught, or I, whose fathers served The third man Edward, and his kindly wife, Philippa, loved the vanities of courts And cast away the birthright of their souls, Were now, perchance, a worldly popinjay, The Lord forgetting and provoking Him Me to forget. But this is needless talk: Thy hands declare that thou art bred to work; Thy face, methinks, is truthful; if thy life Be good, I know not. I can trust no more Than knowledge justifies, and charity Bids us assume until the knowledge comes.” “No more I ask,” Lars answered; “simple ways To me are home-ways: I can learn to serve, Because, when others served me, I was just.” “Our ways are strange to thee,” said Ezra;“thine Unsuitable, if here too long retained. The just in spirit find in outward things A voice and testimony, which may not Be lightly changed: what sayest thou to this?” “To change in mine? Why, truly, 't were no change To do thy bidding, yet to call thee friend; To use the speech of brethren, as at home; And, feigning not the faith that still may part, To bide in charity till knowledge comes.— So much, without a promise, I should give.” “Thou speakest fairly,” Ezra said; “to me Is need of labor less than faithful will, But this includes the other: if thou stand The easier test, the greater then may come. The man who feels his duty makes his own The beasts he tends or uses, and the fields, Though all may be another's.” “Then,” said Ruth, “My cows already must belong to Lars: His speech was strange, and yet they understood.” So Lars remained. That night, beneath the roof, His head lay light; the very wind that breathed Its low, perpetual wail among the boughs Sufficed to cheer him, and the one dim star That watched him from the highest heaven of heavens Made morning in his heart. Too soon passed off The exalted mood, too soon his rich content Was tarnished by the daily round of toil, And all things grown familiar; yet his pride, That rose at censure for each petty fault Of ignorance, supported while it stung. And Ezra Mendenhall was just, and Ruth Serenely patient, sweetly calm and kind: So, month by month, the even days were born And died, the nights were drowned in deeper rest, And fields and fences, streams and stately woods, Fashioned themselves to suit his newer life, Till ever fainter grew those other forms Of fiord and fell, the high Hardanger range, And Romsdal's teeth of snow. Yea, Brita's eyes And Per's hot face he learned to hold away, Save when they vexed his helpless soul in dreams. The land was called Hockessin. O'er its hills, High, wide, and fertile, blew a healthy air: There was a homestead set wherever fell A sunward slope, and breathed its crystal vein, And up beyond the woods, at crossing roads, The heart of all, the ancient meeting-house; And Lars went thither on an autumn morn. Beside him went, it happened, Abner Cloud, A neighbor; rigid in the sect, and rich, And it was rumored that he crossed the hill To Ezra's house, oftener than neighbor-wise. This knew not Lars: but Abner's eye, he thought, Fell not upon him as a friend's should fall, And Abner's tongue perplexed him, for its tone Was harsh or sneering when his words were fair. He spake from every quarter, as a man Who seeks a tender spot, or wound unhealed, And probes the surface which he seems to soothe Until some nerve betrays infirmity. This, only, were the two alone: if Ruth Came near, his face grew mild as curded milk, And unctuous kindness overflowed his lips Precise and thin, as who should godlier be? Perhaps he wooed. but 't was a wooing strange, Lars fancied, or his heart were other stuff Than those are made of which can bless or slay. It was a silent meeting. Here the men And there the women sat, the elder folk Facing the younger from their rising seats, With faces grave beneath the stiff, straight brim Or dusky bonnet. They the stillness breathed Like some high air wherein their souls were free, And on their features, as on those that guard The drifted portals of Egyptian fanes, Sat mystery: the Spirit they obeyed By voice or silence, as the influence fell, Was near them, or their common seeking made A spiritual Presence, mightier than the grasp Of each, possessed in reverence by all. But o'er the soul of Lars there lay the shade Of his own strangeness: peace came not to him. A while he idly watched the flies that crawled Along the hard, bare pine, or marked, in front, The close-cut hair and flaring lobes of ears, Until his mind turned on itself, and made A wizard twilight, where the shapes of life Shone forth and faded: subtler sense awoke, But dream-like first, and then the form of Per Became a living presence which abode; And all the pain and trouble of the past Threatened like something evil yet to come. At last, that phantasm of his memory sat Beside him, and would not be banished thence By will or prayer: he lifted up his face, And met the cold gray eyes of Abner Cloud. The man, thenceforward, seemed an enemy, And Ruth, he scarce knew why, but all her ways So cheered and soothed, a power to subjugate The devil in his heart. But now the leaves Flashed into glittering jewels ere they fell; The pastures lessened, and, when day was done Came quiet evenings, bare of tale and song, Such as beneath Norwegian rafters shook Tired lids awake; and wearisome to Lars, Till Ruth, who noted, fetched the useless books Of school-girl days, and portioned him his task, Herself the teacher. Oft would Ezra smile To note her careful and unyielding sway. “Nay, now,” he said; “I thought our speech was plain, But thou dost hedge each common phrase with thorns, Like something rare: dost thou not make it hard?” “A right foundation, father,” she replied, “Makes easy building: thus it is in life. I teach thee, Lars, no other than the Lord Requires of all, through discipline that makes His goodness hard until it lives in us.” With paler cheeks Lars turned him to his task, Thus innocently smitten; but his mind Increased in knowledge, till the alien tongue Obeyed the summons of his thought. So toil Brought freedom, and the winter passed away. Where Lars was blind, the eyes of Abner Cloud Saw more than was. This school-boy giant drew, He fancied, like a rank and chance-sown weed Beside some wholesome plant, the strength away From his desire, of old and rightful root. 'T was not that Ruth should love the stranger,—no! But woman's interest is lightly caught, So hers by Lars, that might have turned to him. Had he not worldly goods, and honest name, And birthright in the meeting? Who could weigh Unknown with these deserts?—but gentleness Is blind, and goodness ignorant; so he, By malice made sagacious, learned to note The large, strong veins that filled and rose, although The tongue was still, the clench of powerful hands, The trouble hiding in the gloomy eye, And wrought on these by cunning words. But most He played with forms of Scandinavian faith In that old time before King Olaf came, And made their huge, divine barbarities, Their strength and slaughter, fields of frost and blood, More hideous. “These are fables, thou wilt claim,” It was his wont to say; “but such must nurse A people false and cruel.” Then would Lars Reply with heat: “Not so! but honest folk, instead, Too frank to hide the face of any fault, And free from all the evil crafts that breed In hearts of cowards!” Ruth, it rarely chanced, Heard aught of this, but when she heard, her voice Came firm and clear: “Indeed, it is not good To drag those times forth from their harmless graves. Their ignorance and wicked strength are dead, And what of good they knew was not their own, But ours as well: this is our sole concern, To feed the life of goodness in ourselves And all, that so the world at last escape The darkness of our fathers far away.” As when some malady within the frame Is planted, slowly tainting all the blood, And underneath the seeming healthy skin In secret grows till strong enough to smite With rank disorder, so the strife increased; And Lars perceived the devil of his guilt Had made a darkness, where he ambushed lay And waited for his time. Against him rose The better knowledge, breeding downy wings Of prayer, yet shaken by mistrust and hate At touch of Abner's malice. Thus the hour, The inevitable, came. A Sabbath morn Of early spring lay lovely on the land. Upon the bridge that to the barn's broad floor Led from the field, stood Lars: his eyes were fixed Upon his knife, and, as he turned the blade This way and that, and with it turned his thought, While musing if 't were best to cover up This witness, or to master what it told, Close to the haft he marked a splash of rust, And shuddered as he held it nearer. “Blood, And doubtless human!” spake a wiry voice, And Abner Cloud bent down his head to look. A sound of waters filled the ears of Lars And all his flesh grew chill: he said no word. “I have thy history, now,” thought Abner Cloud, And in the pallid silence read but fear; So thus aloud: “Thou art a man of crime, The proper offspring of the godless tribes, Who drank from skulls, and gnawed the very bones Of them they slew. This is thine instrument, And thou art hungering for its bloody use. Say, hast thou ever eaten human flesh?” Then all the landscape, house, and trees, and hills, Before the eyes of Lars, burned suddenly In crimson fire: the roaring of his ears Became a thunder, and his throat was brass. Yet one wild pang of deadly fear of self Shot through his heart, and with a mighty cry Of mingled rage, resistance, and appeal, He flung his arms towards heaven, and hurled afar The fatal knife. This saw not Abner Cloud: But death he saw within those dreadful eyes, And turned and fled. Behind him bounded Lars, The man cast off, the wild beast only left, The primal savage, who is born anew In every child. Not long had been the race, But Ezra Mendenhall, approaching, saw The danger, swiftly thrust himself between, And Lars, whose passion-blinded eyes beheld An obstacle, that only, struck him down. Then deadly hands he dashed at Abner's throat, But they were grasped: he heard the cry of Ruth, Not what she said: he heard her voice, and stood. She knew not what she said: she only saw The wide and glaring eyes suffused with blood, The stiff-drawn lips that, parting, showed the teeth, And on the temples every standing vein That throbbed, dumb voices of destroying wrath. The soul that filled her told her what to do: She dropped his hands and softly laid her own Upon his brow, then looked the devil down Within his eyes, till Lars was there again. Erelong he trembled, while, o'er all his frame A sweat of struggle and of agony Brake forth, and from his throat a husky sob. He tried to speak, but the dry tongue refused; He could but groan, and staggered toward the house, As walks a man who neither hears nor sees. With bloodless lips of fear gasped Abner Cloud: “A murderer!” as Ezra Mendenhall Came, stunned, and with a wound across his brow. “Oh, never!” Ruth exclaimed; but she was pale. She bound her father's head; she gave him drink; She steadied him with arms of gentle strength, Then spake to Abner: “Now, I pray thee, go!” No more: but such was her authority Of speech and glance, the spirit and the power, That he obeyed, and turned, and left the place. Then Ezra's strength came back; and “Ruth,” he said, “I see thou hast a purpose: let me know!” “I only feel,” she answered, “that a soul Is here in peril, but the way to help Is not made plain: the knowledge will be given.” “I have no fear for thee, my daughter: do What seemeth good, and strongly brought upon Thy mind by plain direction of the Lord! There is a power of evil in the man That might be purged, if once he saw the light.” She left him, seated in the sunny porch: Within the house and orchard all was still, Nor found she Lars, at first. But she was driven By that vague purpose which was void of form, And climbed, at last, to where his chamber lay, Beneath the rafters. On the topmost step He sat, his forehead bent upon his knees, A bundle at his side, as when he came. He raised his head: Ruth saw his eyes were dull, His features cold and haggard, and his voice, When thus he spake to her, was hoarse and strange: “Thou need'st not tell me: I already know. I hope thou thinkest it is hard to me. I am a man of violence and blood, Not meet for thy pure company; and now When unto peaceful ways my heart inclined, And thou hadst shown the loveliness of good, My guilt, not yet atoned, brings other guilt To drive me forth: and this disgrace is worst.” Ruth stood below him where he sat: she laid One hand upon the hand upon his knee, And spake: “I judge thee not; I cannot know What grievous loss or strong temptation wrought; But if, indeed, to good and peaceful ways Thy heart inclines, canst thou not wrestle with The Adversary? This knowledge of thy guilt Is half-repentance: whole would make thee sound.” “And then—and then”—his natural voice returned; “Then—pardon?” “Pardon, now, from me and him, My father,—for I know his perfect heart,— Thou hast; but couldst thou turn thy dreadful strength That so it lift, and change, and chasten thee?” “If I but could!”—he cried, and bowed again His forehead. “Wait!” she whispered, left him there, And sought her father. Now, when Ezra heard All this repeated, for a space he sat In earnest meditation. “Bid him come!” He said, at last, and Ruth brought Lars to him Upon the doubting and the suffering face The old man gazed; then “Put thy bundle by!” Came from his lips; “thou shalt not leave, to-day. Thy hands have done thee hurt; if thou art just, One service do thyself, in following me. Come with us to the meeting: there the Lord Down through the silence of fraternal souls May reach His hand. We cannot guess His ways; Only so much the inward Voice declares.” But little else was said: upon them lay The shadow of an unknown past, the weight Of present trouble, the uncertainty Of what should come; yet o'er the soul of Ruth Hung something happier than she dared to feel, And Lars, in silence, with submissive feet Followed, as one who in a land of mist Feels one side warmer, where the sun must be. Then, parted ere they reached the separate doors, Lars went with Ezra. Abner Cloud, within, Beheld them enter, and he marvelled much Such things could be. Straightway the highest seat Took Ezra, where the low partition-boards Sundered the men and women. There alone Sat they whom most the Spirit visited, And spake through them, and gave authority. Then silence fell; how long, Lars could not know, Nor Ruth, for each was in a trance of soul, Till Ezra rose. His words, at first, were few And broken, and they trembled on his lips; But soon the power and full conviction came, And then, as with Ezekiel's trumpet-voice He spake: “Lo! many vessels hath the Lord Set by the fount of Evil in our hearts. Here envy and false-witness catch the green, There pride the purple, lust the ruddy stream: But into anger runs the natural blood, And flows the faster as 't is tapped the more. Here lies the source: the conquest here begins, Then meekness comes, good-will, and purity. Let whoso weigh, when his offence is sore, The Lord's offences, and his patience mete, Though myriads less in measure, by the Lord's! This yoke is easy, if in love ye bear. For none, the lowest, rather hates than loves; But Love is shy, and Hate delights to show A brazen forehead; 't is the noblest sign Of courage, and the rarest, to reveal The tender evidence of brotherhood. With one this sin is born, with other, that; Who shall compare them?—either sin is dark, But one redeeming Light is over both. The Evil that assails resist not ye With equal evil!—else ye change to man The Lord within, whom ye should glorify By words that prove Him, deeds that bless like Him! What spake the patient and the holy Christ? Unto thy brother first be reconciled, Then bring thy gift! and further: Bless ye them That curse you, and do good to them that hate And persecute, that so the children ye may be Of Him, the Father. Yea, His perfect love Renewed in us, and of our struggles born, Gives, even on earth, His pure, abiding peace. Behold, these words I speak are nothing new, But they are burned with fire upon my mind To help—the Lord permit that they may save!” Therewith he laid his hat aside, and all Beheld the purple welt across his brow, And marvelled. Thus he prayed: “Our God and Lord And Father, unto whom our secret sins Lie bare and scarlet, turn aside from them In holy pity, search the tangled heart And breathe Thy life upon its seeds of good! Thou leavest no one wholly dark: Thou giv'st The hope and yearning where the will is weak, And unto all the blessed strength of love. So give to him, and even withhold from me Thy gifts designed, that he receive the more: Give love that pardons, prayer that purifies, And saintly courage that can suffer wrong, For these beget Thy peace, and keep Thee near!” He ceased: all hearts were stirred; and suddenly Amid the younger members Lars arose, Unconscious of the tears upon his face, And scarcely audible: “Oh, brethren here, He prayed for my sake, for my sake pray ye! I am a sinful man: I do repent. I see the truth, but in my heart the lamp Is barely lighted, any wind may quench. Bear with me still, be helpful, that I live!” Then all not so much wondered but they felt The man's most earnest need; and many a voice Responsive murmured: “Yea, I will!” and some, Whose brows were tombstones over passions slain, When meeting broke came up and took his hand. The three walked home in silence, but to Lars The mist had lifted, and around him fell A bath of light; and dimly spread before His feet the sweetness of a purer world. When Ezra, that diviner virtue spent Which held him up, grew faint upon the road, The arm of Lars became a strength to him; Yet all he said, before the evening fell, Was: “Gird thy loins, my friend, the way is long And wearisome: haste not, but never rest!” “I will not close mine eyes,” said Lars to Ruth, And laid aside the book, No Cross, No Crown, She gave him as a comfort and a help; “Till thou hast heard the tale I have to tell. Thou speakest truth, the knowledge of my sin Is half-repentance, yet the knowledge burns Like fire in ashes till it be confessed. Revoke thy pardon, if it must be so, When all is told: yea, speak to me no more, But I must speak!” So he began, and spared No circumstance of love, and hate, and crime, The songs and dances which the Friends forbid, The bloody customs and the cries profane, Till all lay bare and horrible. And Ruth Grew pale and flushed by turns, and often wept, And, when he ceased, was silent. “Now, farewell!” He would have said, when she looked up and spake: “Thy words have shaken me: we read such tales, Nor comprehend, so distant and obscure: Thou makest manifest the living truth. Save thee, I never knew a man of blood: Thou shouldst be wicked, and my heart declares Thy gentleness: ah, feeling all thy sin, Can I condemn thee, nor myself condemn? Thy burden, thus, is laid upon me. Pray For power and patience, pray for victory! Then falls the burden, and my soul is glad.” Lars saw what he had done. His limbs unstrung Gave way, and softly on his knees he sank, And all the passion of his nature bore His yearning upward, till in faith it died. He rose, at last; his face was calm and strong: Ruth smiled, and then they parted for the night. Yet Ezra's words were true: the way was long And wearisome. The better will was there, But not the trust in self; for, still beside Those pleasant regions opening on his soul, Beat the unyielding blood, as beats afar The vein of lightning in a summer cloud. And, as in each severe community Of interests circumscribed, where all is known And roughly handled till opinions join, So, here were those who kindly turned to Lars, And those who doubted, or declared him false. In this probation, Ruth became his stay: She knew and turned not, knew and yet believed As did no other,—hoping more than he. Meanwhile the summer and the harvest came. One afternoon, within the orchard, Ruth Gathered the first sweet apples of the year, That give such pleasure by their painted cheeks And healthy odor. Little breezes shook The interwoven flecks of sun and shade, O'er all the tufted carpet of the grass; The birds sang near her, and beyond the hedge, Where stretched the oat-field broad along the hill, Were harvest voices, broken wafts of sound, That brought no words. Then something made her start; She gazed and waited: o'er the thorny wall Lars leaped, or seemed to fly, and ran to her, His features troubled and his hands outstretched. “O Ruth!” he cried; “I pray thee, take my hands! This power I have, at last: I can refrain Till help be sought, the help that dwells in thee.” She took his hands, and soon, in kissing palms, His violent pulses learned the beat of hers. Sweet warmth o'erspread his frame; he saw her face, And how the cheeks flushed and the eyelids fell Beneath his gaze, and all at once the truth Beat fast and eager in the palms of both. “Take not away;” he cried: “now, nevermore, Thy hands! O Ruth, my saving angel, give Thyself to me, and let our lives be one! I cannot spare thee: heart and soul alike Have need of thee, and seem to cry aloud: ‘Lo! faith and love and holiness are one!’” But who shall paint the beauty of her eyes When they unveiled, and softly clung to his, The while she spake: “I think I loved thee first When first I saw thee, and I give my life, In perfect trust and faith, to these thy hands.” “The fight is fought,” said Lars; “so blest by thee, The strength of darkness and temptation dies. If now the light must reach me through thy soul, It is not clouded: clearer were too keen, Too awful in its purity, for man.” So into joy revolved the doubtful year, And, ere it closed, the gentle fold of Friends Sheltered another member, even Lars. The evidence of faith, in words and ways, Could none reject, and thus opinions joined, And that grew natural which was marvel first. Then followed soon, since Ezra willed it so, Seeing that twofold duty guided Ruth, The second marvel, bitterness to one Who blamed his haste, nor felt how free is fate, Whose sweeter name is love, of will or plan. And all the country-side assembled there, One winter Sabbath, when in snow and sky The colors of transfiguration shone, Within the meeting-house. There Ruth and Lars Together sat upon the women's side, And when the peace was perfect, they arose. He took her by the hand, and spake these words, As ordered: “In the presence of the Lord And this assembly, by the hand I take Ruth Mendenhall, and promise unto her, Divine assistance blessing me, to be A loving and faithful husband, even Till death shall separate us.” Then spake Ruth The same sweet words; and so the twain were one. BOOK III Love's history, as Life's, is ended not By marriage: though the ignorant Paradise May then be lost, the world of knowledge waits, With ample opportunities, to mould Young Eve and Adam into wife and man. Some grace of sentiment expires, yet here The nobler poetry of life begins: The squire is knight, the novice takes the vow, Old service falls, new powers and duties join, And that high Beauty, which is crown of all, No more a lightsome maid, with tresses free And mantle floating from the bosom bare, Confronts us now like holy Barbara, As Palma drew, or she, Our Lady, born On Melos, type of perfect growth and pure. So Lars and Ruth beside each other learned What neither, left unwedded, could have won: He how reliant and how fond the heart Whose love seemed almost pity, she how firm And masterful the nature, which appealed There for support where hers had felt no strain; And both, how solemn, sweet, and wonderful The life of man. Their life, indeed, was still, Too still for aught save blessing, for a time. All things were ordered: plenty in the house And fruitfulness of field and meadow made Light labor, and the people came and went, According to their old and friendly ways. Within the meeting-house upon the hill Now Ezra oftener spake, and sometimes Lars, Fain to obey the spirit which impelled; And what of customed phrase they missed, or tone, Unlike their measured chant, did he supply With words that bore a message to the heart. All this might seem sufficient; yet to Ruth Was still unrest, where, unto shallow eyes Dwelt peace; she felt the uneasy soul of Lars, And waited, till his own good time should come. Yea, verily, he was happy: could she doubt The signs in him that spake the same in her? Yea, he was happy: every day proclaimed The freshness of a blessing rebestowed, The conscious gift, unworn by time or use, And this was sweet to see; yet he betrayed That wavering will, the opposite of faith, Which comes of duty known and not performed. It seemed his lines of life were cast in peace, In green Hockessin, where Lars Thorstensen, A sound that echoed of Norwegian shores, Became Friend Thurston: all things there conspired To blot the Past, but in his soul it lived. Then, as his thoughts went back, his tongue revealed: He spake of winding fiord and windy fell, Of Ulvik's cottages and Graven's lake, And all the moving features of a life So strange to Ruth; till she made bold to break, Through playful chiding, what was grave surmise: “I fear me, Lars, that thou art sick for home. Thy love is with me and thy memory far: Thou seest with half thy sight; and in thy dreams I hear thee murmur in thine other tongue, So soft and strange, so good, I cannot doubt, If I but knew it; but thy dreams are safe.” “Nay, wife,” he said; “misunderstand them not! For dreams hold up before the soul, released From worldly business, pictures of itself, And in confused and mystic parables Foreshadow what it seeks. I do confess I love Old Norway's bleak, tremendous hills, Where winter sits, and sees the summer burn In valleys deeper than yon cloud is high: I love the ocean-arms that gleam and foam So far within the bosom of the land: It is not that. I do confess to thee I love the frank, brave habit of the folk, The hearts unspoiled, though fed from ruder times And filled with angry blood: I love the tales That taught, the ancient songs that cradled me, The tongue my mother spake, unto the Lord As sweet as thine upon the lips of prayer: It is not that.” Then he perused her face Full earnestly, and drew a deeper breath. “My wife, my Ruth,” his words came, low yet firm; “Thou knowest of one who brake a precious box Of ointment, and refreshed the weary feet Of Him who pardoned her. But, had He given Not pardon only, had He stretched His arm And plucked, as from the vine of Paradise, All blessing and all bounty and all good, What then were she that idly took and used?” “I read thy meaning,” answered Ruth; “speak on!” “Am I not he that idly uses? Are there not Here many reapers, there a wasting field? In them the fierce inheritance of blood I overcame, is mighty still to slay; For ancient custom is a ring of steel They know not how to snap. By day and night A powerful spirit calls me: ‘Go to them!’ What should mine answer to the spirit be?” If there were aught of struggle in her heart, She hid the signs. A little pale her cheek, But with untrembling eyelids she upraised Her face to his, and took him by the hands: “Thy Lord is mine: what should I say to thee, Except what she, whose name I bear, ere yet She went to glean in Bethlehem's harvest-field, Said to Naomi: ‘Nay, entreat me not To leave thee, or return from following thee?’ Should not thy people, then, be mine, As mine are made thine own? I will not fail: He calls On both of us who gives thee this command.” So Ruth, erelong, detached her coming life From all its past, until each well-known thing No more was sure or needful, to her mind. Her neighbors, even, seemed to come and go Like half-existences; her days, as well, Were clad with dream; she understood the words, “I but sojourn among you for a time,” And, from the duties which were habits, turned To brood o'er those unknown, awaiting her. But Ezra, when he heard their purpose, spake “Because this thing is very hard to me, I dare not preach against it; but I doubt, Being acquainted with the heart of man. 'T is one thing, Lars, to build thy virtue here, Where others urge the better will: but there, Alone, persuaded, ridiculed, assailed, Couldst thou resist, yet love them? Nay, I know Thy power and conscience: Try them not too soon; Is all I ask. See, I am full of years, And thou, my daughter, thou, indeed a son, Stay me on either side: wait but awhile And ye are free, yea, seasoned as twin beams Of soundest oak, for lintels of His door.” They patiently obeyed. The years went by, Until five winters blanched to perfect snow The old man's hair. Then, when the gusts of March Shook into life the torpid souls of trees, His body craved its rest. He summoned Lars, And meekly said: “I pray thee, pardon me That I have lived so long: I meant it not. Now I am certain that the end is near; And, noting as I must, the deep concern On both your minds, I fain would aid that work, The which, I see, ye mean to undertake.” Then counsel wise he gave: it seemed his mind, Those five long years, had pondered all things well, Computed every chance and sought the best, Foresaw and weighed, foreboded and prepared, Until the call was made his legacy. At last he said: “My sight is verily clear, And I behold your duty as yourselves;” Then spake farewell with pleasant voice, and died. When summer came, upon an English ship Sailed Lars and Ruth between the rich green shores That widened, sinking, till the land was drowned, And they were blown on rolling fields of blue. Blown backward more than on; and evil eyes Of sailors on their sober Quaker garb Began to turn. “Our Jonah!” was the cry, When Lars was seen upon the quarter-deck, And one, a ruffian from the Dorset moors, Became so impudent and foul of tongue That Ruth was frightened, would have fled below, But Lars prevented her. Three strides he made, Then by the waistband and the neck he seized That brutish boor, and o'er the bulwarks held, Above the brine, like death for very fear. “Now, promise me to keep a decent tongue!” Cried Lars; and he: “I promise anything, But let me not be lost!” Thenceforth respect Those sailors showed to strength, though clad in peace. “Now see I wherefore thou wert made so strong,” Ruth said to him, and inwardly rejoiced; And soon the mists and baffling breezes fled Before a wind that down from Labrador Blew like a will unwearied, night and day, Across the desert of the middle sea. Out of the waters rose the Scilly Isles, Afar and low, and then the Cornish hills, And, floating up by many a valley-mouth Of Devon streams, they came to Bristol town. Awhile among their brethren they abode, For thus had Ezra ordered. There were some Concerned in trade, whose vessels to and fro From Hull across the German Ocean sailed, And touched Norwegian ports; and Lars in those The old man said, must find his nearest stay. But soon it chanced that with a vessel came A man of Arendal, in Norway land, Known to the Friends as fair in word and deed, And well-inclined; and Gustaf Hansen named. Norse tongue makes easy friendship: Lars and he Became as brothers in a little while, And, when his worldly charge was ordered, they Together all embarked for Arendal. Calm autumn skies were o'er them, and the sea Swelled in unwrinkled glass: they scarcely knew How sped the voyage, until Lindesnaes, At first a cloud, stood fast, and spread away To flanking capes, with gaps of blue between; Then rose, and showed, above the precipice, The firs of Norway climbing thick and high To wilder crests that made the inland gloom. In front, the sprinkled skerries pierced the wave; Between them, slowly glided in and out The tawny sails, while houses low and red Hailed their return, or sent them fearless forth. “This is thy Norway, Lars; it looks like thee,” Said Ruth: “it has a forehead firm and bold; It sets its foot below the reach of storms, Yet hides, methinks, in each retiring vale, Delight in toil, contentment, love, and peace,— My land, my husband! let me love it, too!” So on their softened hearts the sun went down And rose once more; then Gustaf Hansen came Beside them, pilot of familiar shores, And said: “To starboard, yonder, lies the isle As I described it; here, upon our lee Is mainland all, and there the Nid comes down, The timber-shouldering Nid, from endless woods And wilder valleys where scant grain is grown. Now bend your glances as my finger points,— Lo! there it is, the spire of Arendal! Our little town, as homely, kind, and dear, As some old dame, round whom her children's babes Cling to be petted, comforted, and spoiled. And here, my friends, shall ye with me abide And with my Thora, till the winter melts, Which there, beyond yon wall of slaty cloud, Possesses fell and upland even now. Too strange is Ruth to dare those snowy wastes, Nor is there need: good Thora's heart will turn To her, I know, as mine hath turned to Lars; And Arendal is warmly-harbored, snug, And not unfriendly in the time of storms.” They could not say him nay. The anchor dropped Before the town, and Thora, from the land, Tall, broad of breast, with ever-rosy cheeks O'er which the breezes tossed her locks of gray, Stretched arms of welcome; and the ancient house, With massive beams and ample chimney-place, As in Hockessin, made immediate home. To Ruth, how sweetly the geraniums peeped With scarlet eyes across the window-sill! How orderly the snowy curtains shone! Familiar, too, the plainness and the use In all things; presses of the dusky oak, Fair linen, store of healing herbs that smelled Of charity, and signs of forethought wise That justified the plenty of the house. It was as Gustaf said: good Thora loved The foreign woman, taught and counselled her, Taking to heart their purpose, so that she Unconsciously received the truth of Friends. And Gustaf also, through the soul of Lars, To him laid bare, and all that blessing clear Obedience brings when speaks the inward voice, Believed erelong; then others came to hear, Till there, in Arendal, a brotherhood Of earnest seekers for the light grew up, Before the hasty spring of northern lands Sowed buttercups along the banks of Nid. But when they burst, those precious common flowers That not a meadow of the world can spare, Said Lars, one Sabbath, to the little flock: “Here we have tarried long, and it is well; But now we go, and it is also well. This much is blessing added unto those That went before; hence louder rings the call Which brought me hither, and I must obey. My path is clear, my duty strange and stern, The end thereof uncertain; it may be, My brethren, I shall never see ye more. Your love upholds me, and your faith confirms My purpose: bless me now, and bid farewell!” Then Gustaf wept, and said: “Our brother, go! Yet thou art with us, and we walk with thee In this or yonder world, as bids the Lord.” Their needful preparations soon were made: Two strong dun horses of the mountain breed, With hoofs like claws, that clung where'er they touched, Unholstered saddles, leathern wallets filled With scrip for houseless ways, close-woven cloaks To comfort them upon the cloudy fells, And precious books, by Penn and Barclay writ And Woolman,—these made up their little store. The few and faithful went with them a space Along the banks of Nid; there first besought All power and light, and furtherance for the task Awaiting Lars: they knew not what it was, But what it was, they knew, was good: then all Gave hands and said farewell, and Lars and Ruth Rode boldly onward, facing the dark land. Across the lonely hills of Tellemark, That smiled in sunshine, went their earnest way, And by the sparkling waters of the Tind; Then, leaving on the left that chasm of dread Where, under Gousta's base, the Riukan falls In winnowing blossoms, tendrilled vines of foam, And bursting rockets of the starry spray, They rode through forests into Hemsedal. The people marvelled at their strange attire, But all were kind; and Ruth, to whom their speech Was now familiar, found such ordered toil, Such easy gladness, temperate desire, That many doubts were laid: the spirit slept, She thought, and waited but a heartsome call. Then ever higher stood the stormy fells Against uncertain skies, as they advanced; And ever grander plunged the roaring snow Of mighty waterfalls from cliff to vale: The firs were mantled in a blacker shade, The rocks were rusted as with ancient blood, And winds that shouted or in wailing died Harried the upper fields, in endless wrath At finding there no man. The soul of Lars Expanded with a solemn joy; but Ruth, Awed by the gloom and wildness of the land, Rode close and often touched her husband's arm; And when within its hollow dell they saw The church of Borgund like a dragon sit, Its roof all horns, its pitchy shingles laid Like serpent scales, its door a dusky throat, She whispered: “This the ancients must have left From their abolished worship: is it so? This is no temple of the living Lord, That makes me fear it like an evil thing!” “Consider not its outward form,” said Lars, “Or mine may vex thee, for my sin outgrown. I would the dragon in the people's blood As harmless were!” So downward, side by side, From ridges of the windy Fille Fell Unto the borders of the tamer brine, The sea-arm bathing Frithiof's home, they rode; Then two days floated past those granite walls That mock the boatman with a softer song, And took the land again, where shadow broods, And frequent thunder of the tumbling rocks Is heard the summer through, in Nærödal. To Ruth the gorge seemed awful, and the path That from its bowels toiled to meet the sun, Was hard as any made for Christian's feet, In Bunyan's dream; but Lars with lighter step The giddy zigzag scaled, for now, beyond, Not distant, lay the Vossevangen vale, And all the cheerful neighborhood of home. At last, one quiet afternoon, they crossed The fell from Graven, and below them saw The roofs of Ulvik and the orchard-trees Shining in richer colors, and the fiord, A dim blue gloom between Hardanger heights,— The strife and peace, the plenty and the need; And both were silent for a little space. Then Ruth: “I had not thought thy home so fair, Nor yet so stern and overhung with dread, It seems to draw me as a danger draws, Yet gives me courage: is it well with thee?” “That which I would, I know,” responded Lars, “Not that which may be: ask no more, I pray!” Then downward, weary, strangely moved, yet glad, They went, a wonder to the Ulvik folk, Till some detected, 'neath his shadowy brim, The eyes of Lars; and he was scarcely housed With his astonished kindred, ere the news Spread from the fountain, ran along the shore. For all believed him dead: in truth, the dead Could not have risen in stranger guise than he, Who spake as one they knew and did not know, Who seemed another, yet must be the same. His folk were kind: they owned the right of blood, Nor would disgrace it, though a half-disgrace Lars seemed to bring; but in her strange, sweet self Ruth brought a pleasure which erelong was love. Her gentle voice, her patient, winning ways, Pure thought and ignorance of evil things That on her wedlock left a virgin bloom, Set her above them, yet her nature dwelt In lowliness: sister and saint she seemed. Soon Thorsten, brother of the slaughtered Per, Alike a stalwart fisher of the fiord, Heard who had come, and published unto all The debt of blood he meant to claim of Lars. “The coward, only, comes as man of peace, To shirk such payment!” were his bitter words. And they were carried unto Lars: but he Spake firmly: “Well I knew what he would claim: The coward, knowing, comes not.” Nothing more; Nor could they guess the purpose of his mind. In little Ulvik all the people learned What words had passed, and there were friends of both; But Lars kept silent, walked the ways unarmed, And preached the pardon of an utmost wrong. Now Thorsten saw in this but some device To try his own forbearance: his revenge Grew hungry for an answering enmity, And weary of its shame; and so, at last, He sent this message: “If Lars Thorstensen Deny not blood he spilled, and guilt thereof, Then let him meet me by the Graven lake,”— On such a day. When came the message, Lars Spake thus to all his kindred: “I will go: I do deny not my blood-guiltiness. This thing hath rested on my soul for years, And must be met.” Then unto Ruth he turned: “I go alone: abide thou with our kin.” But she arose and answered: “Nay, I go! Forbid me not, or I must disobey, Which were a cross. I give thee to the Lord, His helpless instrument, to break or save; Think not my weakness shall confuse thy will!” Lars laid his hand upon her head, and all Were strangely melted, though he spake no more, Nor then, nor on the way to Graven lake. Lo! there were many gathered, kin of both, Or friends, or folk acquainted with the tale, And curious for its end. The summer sky Was beautiful above them, and the trees Stood happy, stretching forth forgiving arms; Yet sultry thunder in the hearts of men Brooded, the menace of a rain of blood. Lars paused not when he came. He saw the face Of Thorsten, ruddy, golden-haired like Per's, Amid the throng, and straightway went to him And spake: “I come, as thou invitest me. My brother, I have shed thy brother's blood; What wouldst thou I should do thee, to atone?” “Give yours!” cried Thorsten, stepping back a pace. “That murderous law we took from heathen sires,” Said Lars, “is guilt upon a Christian land. I do abjure it. Wilt thou have my blood, Nor less, I dare not lift a hand for thine.” “You came not, then, to fight, though branded here A coward?” “Nay, nor ever,” answered Lars; “But, were I coward, could I calmly bear Thy words?” Then Thorkil, friend of Thorsten, cried: “These people, in their garments, I have heard, Put on their peace; or else some magic dwells In shape of hat or color of the coat, To make them harmless as a browsing hare. That Lars we knew had danger in his eyes; But this one,—why, uncover, let us see!” Therewith struck off the hat. And others there Fell upon Lars, and tore away his coat, Nor ceased the outrage until they had made His body bare to where the leathern belt Is clasped between the breast-bone and the hip. Around his waist they buckled then a belt, And brought a knife, and thrust it in his hand. The open fingers would not hold: the knife Fell from them, struck, and quivered in the sod. Thorsten, apart, had also bared his breast, And waited, beautiful in rosy life. Then Thorkil and another drew the twain Together, hooked the belts of each, and strove Once more to arm the passive hand of Lars: In vain: his open fingers would not hold The knife, which fell and quivered in the sod. He looked in Thorsten's eyes; great sorrow fell Upon him, and a tender human love. “I did not this,” he said; “nor will resist. If thou art minded so, then strike me dead: But thou art sacred, for the blood I spilled Is in thy veins, my brother: yea, all blood Of all men sacred is in thee.” His arms Hung at his side: he did not shrink or sway: His flesh touched Thorsten's where the belts were joined, And felt its warmth. Then twice did Thorsten lift His armèd hand, and twice he let it sink: An anguish came upon his face: he groaned, And all that heard him marvelled at the words; “Have pity on me; turn away thine eyes: I cannot slay thee while they look on me!” “If I could end this bloody custom so, In all the land, nor plant a late remorse For what is here thy justice,” answered Lars, “I could not say thee nay. Yet, if the deed Be good, thou shouldst have courage for the deed!” Once more looked Thorsten in those loving eyes, And shrank, and shuddered, and grew deadly pale, Till, with a gasp for breath, as one who drowns Draws, when he dips again above the wave, He loosed the clutching belts, and sat him down And hid his face: they heard him only say: “'T were well that I should die, for very shame!” Lars heard, and spake to all: “The shame is mine, Whose coward heart betrayed me unto guilt. I slew my brother Per, nor sought his blood: Thou, Thorsten, wilt not mine; I read thy heart. But ye, who trample on the soul of man In still demanding he shall ne'er outgrow The savage in his veins, through faith in Good, Who Thorsten rule, even as ye ruled myself,— I call ye to repent! That God we left, White Balder, were more merciful than this: If one, henceforward, cast on Thorsten shame, The Lord shall smite him when the judgment comes!” Never before, such words in such a place Were preached by such apostle. Bared, as though For runes of death, while red Berserker rage Kindled in some, in others smouldered out, He raised his hand and pointed to the sky: Far off, behind the silent fells, there rolled A sudden thunder. Ruth, who all the while Moved not nor spake, stood forth, and o'er her face There came the glory of an opening heaven. Now that she knew the habit of the folk, She spake not; but she clothed the form of Lars In silence, and the women, weeping, helped. Then Thorsten rose, and seeing her, he said: “Thou art his wife; they tell me thou art good. I am no bloodier than thy husband was Before he knew thee: hast thou aught to say?” She took his hand and spake, as one inspired: “Thou couldst not make thyself a man of blood! This is thy seed of blessing: let it grow! Gladness of heart, and peace, and honored name Shall come to thee: the unrighteous, cruel law Is broken by thy hands, no less than his Who loves thee, and would sooner die than harm!” “They speak the truth,” said Thorsten; “thou art good, And it were surely bitter grief to thee If I had slain him. Go! his blood is safe From hands of mine.” His words the most approved; The rest, bewildered, knew not what to say. In these the stubborn mind and plastic heart Agreed not quickly, for the thing was strange, An olden tale with unforeboded end: They must have time. The crowd soon fell apart, Some faces glad, all solemn, and dispersed; Except one woman, who, from time to time, Pressed forward, then, as with uncertain will, Turned back as often. Troubled was her face And worn: within the hollows of her eyes Dwelt an impatient sorrow, and her lips Had from themselves the girlish fulness pressed. Her hair hung negligent, though plenteous still; And beauty that no longer guards itself, But listlessly beholds its ruin come, Made her an apparition wild and sad, A cloud on others' joy. Lars, as he left That field unsullied, saw the woman stand. “Brita!” he cried; and all the past returned And all the present mixed with it, and made His mouth to quiver and his eyes to fill: “Unhappy Brita, and I made thee so! Is there forgiveness yet for too much love And foolish faith, that brought us double woe? I dare not ask it; couldst thou give unasked?” Her face grew hard to keep the something back Which softened her: “Make Per alive,” she said, “One moment only, that he pardon me, And thou art pardoned! else, I think, canst thou Bear silence, as I bear it from the dead. Oh, thou hast done me harm!” But Ruth addressed These words to her: “I never did thee harm, Yet on my soul my husband's guilt to thee Is made a shadow: let me be thy friend! Only a woman knows a woman's need.” Lars understood the gesture and the glance Which Ruth then gave, and hastened on the path To join his kindred, leaving them alone. So Ruth by Brita walked, and spake to her In words whose very sound a comfort gave, Like some soft wind that o'er an arid land, Unfelt at first, fans on with cooling wings Till all the herbage freshens, and the soil Is moist with dew; and Brita's arid heart Thus opened: “Yea, all this is very well. So much thou knowest, being woman,—love Of man, and man's of thee, and both declared: But say, how canst thou measure misery Of love that lost its chances, made the Past One dumbness, and forever reckons o'er The words unspoken, which to both were sweet, The touch of hands that never binding met, The kisses, never given and never took, The hopes and raptures that were never shared,— Nay, worse than this, for she withheld, who knew They might have been, from him who never knew!” Therewith her passion loosed itself in sobs, And on the pitying breast of Ruth she wept Her heart to calmness; then, with less of pain, She told the simple story of her life: How, scarce two years before, her grandam died, Who would have seen her wedded, and was wroth, At times, in childish petulance of age, But kinder—'t was a blessing!—ere she died, Leaving the cottage highest on the slope, Naught else, to Brita; but her wants were few. The garden helped her, and the spotted cow, Now old, indeed: she span the winter through, And there was meal enough, and Thorsten gave Sometimes a fish, because she grieved for Per; And, now the need of finery was gone,— For men came not a-wooing where consent Abode not,—she had made the least suffice. Yes, she was lonely: it was better so, For she must learn to live in loneliness. As much as unto Ruth she had not said To any woman, trusting her, it seemed, Without a knowledge, more than them she knew “Yea, trust me, Sister Brita!” Ruth replied, “And try to love: my heart is drawn to thee.” Thereafter, many a day, went Ruth alone To Brita's cottage, vexing not with words That woke her grief, and silent as to Lars, Till Brita learned to smile when she appeared, And missed her when she came not. Now, meanwhile, The news of Lars, and Thorsten's foiled revenge Beside the lake of Graven, travelled far Past Vik and Vossevangen, o'er the fells, To all the homesteads of the Bergenstift; And every gentle heart leaped up in joy, While those of restless old Berserker blood Beat hot with wrath. Who oversets old laws, They said, is dangerous; and who is he That dares to preach, and hath not been ordained? This thing concerns the ministers, they whom The State sets over us, with twofold power, Divine and secular, to teach and rule. Then he, the shepherd of the Ulvik flock, Not now that good old man, but one whose youth More hateful showed his Christless bigotry, Made Sabbaths hot with his anathemas Of Lars, and stirred a tumult in the land. Some turned away, and all grew faint of heart, Seeing the foothold yield, and slip; till Lars, Now shunned at home, and drawn by messages From Gustaf Hansen and the faithful souls In Arendal, said: “It is time to go.” “Nay, tarry but a little while,” spake Ruth. “I have my purpose here, as thou hadst thine: Grant me but freedom, for the end, I think, Is justified.” Lars answered: “Have thy will!” She summoned Brita, and the twain went down To pace the scanty strand beside the wave, Which, after storm, was quiet, though the gloom Of high, opposing mountains filled the fiord. Ruth spake of parting; Brita answered not, But up and down in silence walked the strand, Then suddenly: “No message sendeth Lars? My pardon he implored; and that, to thee, I know, were welcome. Hadst thou asked, perchance, Perverse in sorrow, I should still withhold; But thou departest, who hast been so kind, And I—ah, God! what else have I to give?” “The Lord requite thee, Brita!” Ruth exclaimed; “The gift that blesses must be given unasked: What now remains is easy. Come with us, With Lars and me, and be our home thy home, All peace we win, all comfort, thine as ours!” Once more walked Brita up and down the strand, Bowing her face upon her shielding hands, As if to muse, unwatched: then stood, and seemed About to speak, when, with a shrilling cry She sprang, and fell, and grovelled on her knees, And thrust her fingers in the wet sea-sand. Ruth, all in terror, ran to her, and saw How, from the bones of some long-wasted fish An osprey dropped, or tempest beat to death, Caught in the breakers, and the drifted shells, And tangles of the rotting kelp, she plucked Something that sparkled, pressed it to her lips, And cried: “A sign! a sign! 't is grandam speaks!” Then trembling rose, and flung herself on Ruth, And kissed her, saying: “I will follow thee. My heart assented, yet I had denied, But, ere I spake, the miracle was done! Thy words give back the jewel lost with Per: Tell Lars I do forgive him, and will serve Thee, Ruth, a willing handmaid, in thy home!” So Brita went with them to Arendal. There milder habits, easier government Of bench and pulpit for a while left all In peace: and not alone within the fold Of Friends came Brita, but the Lord inspired. She spake with power, as one by suffering taught A chastened spirit, and she wrought good works. She was a happy matron ere she died, And blessing came on all; for, from that day Of doubt and anguish by the Graven lake, The Lord fulfilled in Ruth one secret prayer, And gave her children; and the witness borne By Lars, the voice of his unsprinkled blood, Became a warning on Norwegian hills. Here, now, they fade. The purpose of their lives Was lifted up, by something over life, To power and service. Though the name of Lars Be never heard, the healing of the world Is in its nameless saints. Each separate star Seems nothing, but a myriad scattered stars Break up the Night, and make it beautiful. Gotha, Germany, 1872. LATEST LYRICS 1870–1878 THE BURDEN OF THE DAY I Who shall rise and cast away, First, the Burden of the Day? Who assert his place, and teach Lighter labor, nobler speech, Standing firm, erect, and strong, Proud as Freedom, free as Song? II Lo! we groan beneath the weight Our own weaknesses create; Crook the knee and shut the lip, All for tamer fellowship; Load our slack, compliant clay With the Burden of the Day! III Higher paths there are to tread; Fresher fields around us spread; Other flames of sun and star Flash at hand and lure afar; Larger manhood might we share, Surer fortune,—did we dare! IV In our mills of common thought By the pattern all is wrought: In our school of life, the man Drills to suit the public plan, And through labor, love, and play, Shifts the Burden of the Day. V Ah, the gods of wood and stone Can a single saint dethrone, But the people who shall aid 'Gainst the puppets they have made? First they teach and then obey: 'T is the Burden of the Day. VI Thunder shall we never hear In this ordered atmosphere? Never this monotony feel Shattered by a trumpet's peal? Never airs that burst and blow From eternal summits, know? VII Though no man resent his wrong, Still is free the poet's song: Still, a stag, his thought may leap O'er the herded swine and sheep, And in pastures far away Lose the Burden of the Day! 1870. IN THE LISTS Could I choose the age and fortunate season When to be born, I would fly from the censure of your barren reason, And the scourges of your scorn: Could I take the tongue, and the land, and the station That to me were fit, I would make my life a force and an exultation, And you could not stifle it! But the thing most near to the freedom I covet Is the freedom I wrest From a time that would bar me from climbing above it, To seek the East in the West. I have dreamed of the forms of a nobler existence Than you give me here, And the beauty that lies afar in the dateless distance I would conquer, and bring more near. It is good, undowered with the bounty of Fortune, In the sun to stand: Let others excuse, and cringe, and importune, I will try the strength of my hand! If I fail, I shall fall not among the mistaken, Whom you dare deride: If I win, you shall hear, and see, and at last awaken To thank me because I defied! 1871. THE SUNSHINE OF THE GODS I Who shall sunder the fetters, Who scale the invisible ramparts Whereon our nimblest forces Hurl their vigor in vain? Where, like the baffling crystal To a wildered bird of the heavens, Something holds and imprisons The eager, the stirring brain? II Alas, from the fresh emotion, From thought that is born of feeling, From form, self-shaped, and slowly Its own completeness evolving, To the rhythmic speech, how long! What hand shall master the tumult Where one on the other tramples, And none escapes a wrong? Where the crowding germs of a thousand Fancies encumber the portal, Till one plucks a voice from the murmurs And lifts himself into Song! III As a man that walks in the mist, As one that gropes for the morning Through lengthening chambers of twilight, The souls of the poems wander Restless, and dumb, and lost, Till the Word, like a beam of morning, Shivers the pregnant silence, And the light of speech descends Like a tongue of the Pentecost! IV Ah, moment not to be purchased, Not to be won by prayers, Not by toil to be conquered, But given, lest one despair, By the Gods in wayward kindness, Stay—thou art all too fair! Hour of the dancing measures, Sylph of the dew and rainbow, Let us clutch thy shining hair! V For the mist is blown from the mind, For the impotent yearning is over, And the wings of the thoughts have power: In the warmth and the glow creative Existence mellows and ripens, And a crowd of swift surprises Sweetens the fortunate hour; Till a shudder of rapture loosens The tears that hang on the eyelids Like a breeze-suspended shower, With a sense of heavenly freshness Blown from beyond the sunshine, And the blood, like the sap of the roses, Breaks into bud and flower. VI 'T is the Sunshine of the Gods, The sudden light that quickens, Unites the nimble forces, And yokes the shy expression To the thoughts that waited long,— Waiting and wooing vainly: But now they meet like lovers In the time of willing increase, Each warming each, and giving The kiss that maketh strong: And the mind feels fairest May-time In the marriage of its passions, For Thought is one with Speech, In the Sunshine of the Gods, And Speech is one with Song! VII Then a rhythmic pulse makes order In the troops of wandering fancies: Held in soft subordination, Lo! they follow, lead, or fly. The fields of their feet are endless, And the heights and the deeps are open To the glance of the equal sky: And the Masters sit no longer In inaccessible distance, But give to the haughtiest question, Smiling, a sweet reply. VIII Dost mourn, because the moment Is a gift beyond thy will,— A gift thy dreams had promised, Yet they gave to Chance its keeping And fettered thy free achievement With the hopes they not fulfil? Dost sigh o'er the fleeting rapture, The bliss of reconcilement Of powers that work apart, Yet lean on each other still? IX Be glad, for this is the token, The sign and the seal of the Poet: Were it held by will or endeavor, There were naught so precious in Song. Wait: for the shadows unlifted To a million that crave the sunshine, Shall be lifted for thee erelong. Light from the loftier regions Here unattainable ever,— Bath of brightness and beauty,— Let it make thee glad and strong! Not to clamor or fury, Not to lament or yearning, But to faith and patience cometh The Sunshine of the Gods, The hour of perfect Song! NOTUS IGNOTO I Do you sigh for the power you dream of, The fair, evasive secret, The rare imagined passion, O Friend unknown! Do you haunt Egyptian portals, Where, within, the laboring goddess Yields to the hands of her chosen The sacred child, alone? II Ah, pause! There is consolation For you, and pride: Free of choice and worship, Spared the pang and effort, Nor partial made by triumph, The poet's limitations You lightly set aside: Revived, in your fresher spirit The buds of my thought may blossom, And the clew, from weary fingers Fallen, become your guide! The taker, even as the giver, The user as the maker, Soil as seed, and rain as sunshine, Alike are glorified! III Loss with gain is balanced; You may reach, when I but beckon; You may drink, though mine the vintage, You complete what I begun. When at the temple-door I falter, You advance to the altar; I but rise to the daybreak, You to the sun! My goal is your beginning: My steeps of aspiration For you are won! IV Hark! the nightingale is chanting As if her mate but knew; Yet the dream within me Which the bird-voice wakens, Takes from her unconscious Prompting, form and hue: So the song I sing you, Voice alone of my being, Song for the mate and the nestling Finer and sweeter meaning May possess for you! Lifting to starry summits, Filling with infinite passion, While the witless singer broodeth In the darkness and the dew! V Carved on the rock as an arrow To point your path, am I: A cloud that tells, in the heavens, Which way the breezes fly: A brook that is born in the meadows, And wanders at will, nor guesses Whither its waters hie: A child that scatters blossoms, Thoughtless of memoried odors, Or sweet surprises of color, That waken when you go by: A bee-bird of the woodland, That finds the honeyed hollows Of ancient oaks, for others,— Even as these, am I! VI Accept, and enjoy, and follow,— Conquer wherein I yield! Make yours the bright conclusion, From me concealed! Truth, to whom will possess it, Beauty to whom embraces, Song and its inmost secret, Life and its unheard music, To whom will hear and know them, Are ever revealed! THE TWO HOMES I My home was seated high and fair, Upon a mountain's side; The day was longest, brightest there; Beneath, the world was wide. Across its blue, embracing zone The rivers gleamed, the cities shone, And over the edge of the fading rim I saw the storms in the distance dim, And the flash of the soundless thunder. II But weary grew the sharp, cold wine Of winds that never kissed, The changeless green of fir and pine, The gray and clinging mist. Above the granite sprang no bowers; The soil gave low and scentless flowers; And the drone and din of the waterfall Became a challenge, a taunting call: “'T is fair, 't is fair in the valley!” III Of all the homesteads deep and far My fancy clung to one, Whose gable burned, a mellow star, Touched by the sinking sun. Unseen around, but not unguessed, The orchards made a leafy nest; The turf before it was thick, I knew, And bees were busy the garden through, And the windows were dark with roses. IV “'T is happier there, below,” I sighed: The world is warm and near, And closer love and comfort hide, That cannot reach me here. Who there abides must be so blest He'll share with me his sheltered nest, If down to the valley I should go, Leaving the granite, the pines and snow, And the winds that are keen as lances.” V I wandered down, by ridge and dell; The way was rough and long: Though earlier shadows round me fell, I cheered them with my song. The world's great circle narrower grew, Till hedge and thicket hid the blue; But over the orchards, near at hand, The gable shone on the quiet land, And far away was the mountain! VI Then came the master: mournful-eyed And stern of brow was he. “Oh, planted in such peace!” I cried, “Spare but the least to me!” “Who seeks,” he said, “this brooding haze, The tameness of these weary days? The highway's dust, the glimmer and heat, The woods that fetter the young wind's feet, And hide the world and its beauty?” VII He stretched his hand; he looked afar With eyes of old desire: I saw my home, a mellow star That held the sunset's fire. “But yonder home,” he cried, “how fair! Its chambers burn like gilded air: I know that the gardens are wild as dreams, With the sweep of winds, the dash of streams, And the pines that sound as an anthem! VIII “So quiet, so serenely high It sits, when clouds are furled, And knows the beauty of the sky, The glory of the world! Who there abides must be so blest He'll share with me that lofty crest, If up to the mountain I should go, Leaving the dust and the glare below, And the weary life of the valley!” 1873. IRIS I I am born from the womb of the cloud And the strength of the ardent sun, When the winds have ceased to be loud, And the rivers of rain to run. Then light, on my sevenfold arch, I swing in the silence of air, While the vapors beneath me march And leave the sweet earth bare. II For a moment, I hover and gleam On the skirts of the sinking storm; And I die in the bliss of the beam That gave me being and form. I fade, as in human hearts The rapture that mocks the will: I pass, as a dream departs That cannot itself fulfil! III Beyond the bridge I have spanned The fields of the Poet unfold, And the riches of Fairyland At my bases of misty gold. I keep the wealth of the spheres Which the high Gods never have won; And I coin, from their airy tears, The diadem of the sun! IV For some have stolen the grace That is hidden in rest or strife; And some have copied the face Or echoed the voice of Life: And some have woven of sound A chain of the sweetest control, And some have fabled or found The key to the human soul: V But I, from the blank of the air And the white of the barren beam, Have wrought the colors that flare In the forms of a painter's dream. I gather the souls of the flowers, And the sparks of the gems, to me; Till pale are the blossoming bowers, And dim the chameleon sea! VI By the soul's bright sun, the eye, I am thrown on the artist's brain; He follows me, and I fly; He pauses, I stand again. O'er the reach of the painted world My chorded colors I hold, On a canvas of cloud impearled Drawn with a brush of gold! VII If I lure, as a mocking sprite, I give, as a goddess bestows, The red, with its soul of might, And the blue, with its cool repose; The yellow that beckons and beams, And the gentler children they bear. For the portal of Art's high dreams Is builded of Light and Air! 1872. IMPLORA PACE The clouds that stoop from yonder sky Discharge their burdens, and are free; The streams that take them hasten by, To find relief in lake and sea. The wildest wind in vales afar Sleeps, pillowed on its ruffled wings; And song, through many a stormy bar, Beats into silence on the strings! And love o'ercomes his young unrest, And first ambition's flight is o'er; And doubt is cradled on the breast Of perfect faith, and speaks no more. Our dreams and passions cease to dare, And homely patience learns the part; Yet still some keen, pursuing care Forbids consent to brain and heart The gift unreached, beyond the hand; The fault in all of beauty won; The mildew of the harvest land, The spots upon the risen sun! And still some cheaper service claims The will that leaps to loftier call: Some cloud is cast on splendid aims, On power achieved some common thrall. To spoil each beckoning victory, A thousand pygmy hands are thrust; And, round each height attained, we see Our ether dim with lower dust. Ah, could we breathe some peaceful air And all save purpose there forget, Till eager courage learn to bear The gadfly's sting, the pebble's fret! Let higher goal and harsher way, To test our virtue, then combine! 'T is not for idle ease we pray, But freedom for our task divine. 1872. PENN CALVIN I Search high and low, search up and down, By light of stars or sun, And of all the good folks of our town There 's like Penn Calvin none. He lightly laughs when all condemn, He smiles when others pray; And what is sorest truth to them To him is idle play. II “Penn Calvin, lift, as duty bids, The load we all must bear!” He only lifts his languid lids, And says: “The morn is fair!” “Learn while you may! for Life is stern, And Art, alas! is long.” He hums and answers: “Yes, I learn The cadence of a song.” III “The world is dark with human woe; Man eats of bitter food.” “The world,” he says, “is all aglow With beauty, bliss, and good!” “To crush the senses you must strive, The beast of flesh destroy!” “God gave this body, all alive, And every sense is joy!” IV “Nay, these be heathen words we hear; The faith they teach is flown,— A mist that clings to temples drear And altars overthrown.” “I reck not how nor whence it came,” He answers; “I possess: If heathens felt and owned the same, How bright was heathenesse!” V “Though you be stubborn to believe, Yet learn to grasp and hold: There 's power and honor to achieve, And royal rule of gold!” Penn Calvin plucked an open rose And carolled to the sky: “Shine, sun of Day, until its close,— They live, and so do I!” VI His eyes are clear as they were kissed By some unrisen dawn; Our grave and stern philanthropist Looks sad, and passes on. Our pastor scowls, the pious flock Avert their heads, and flee; For pestilence or earthquake shock Less dreadful seems than he. VII But all the children round him cling, Depraved as they were born; And vicious men his praises sing, Whom he forgets to scorn. Penn Calvin's strange indifference gives Our folks a grievous care: He 's simply glad because he lives, And glad the world is fair! 1871. SUMMER NIGHT VARIATIONS ON CERTAIN MELODIES I ANDANTE Under the full-blown linden and the plane, That link their arms above In mute, mysterious love, I hear the strain! Is it the far postilion's horn, Mellowed by starlight, floating up the valley, Or song of love-sick peasant, borne Across the fields of fragrant corn, And poplar-guarded alley? Now from the woodbine and the unseen rose What new delight is showered? The warm wings of the air Drop into downy indolence and close, So sweetly overpowered: But nothing sleeps, though rest seems everywhere. II ADAGIO Something came with the falling dusk, Came, and quickened to soft unrest: Something floats in the linden's musk, And throbs in the brook on the meadow's breast. Shy Spirit of Love, awake, awake! All things feel thee, And all reveal thee: The night was given for thy sweet sake. Toil slinks aside, and leaves to thee the land; The heart beats warmer for the idle hand; The timid tongue unlearns its wrong, And speech is turned to song; The shaded eyes are braver; And every life, like flowers whose scent is dumb Till dew and darkness come, Gives forth a tender savor. O, each so lost in all, who may resist The plea of lips unkissed, Or, hearing such a strain, Though kissed a thousand times, kiss not again! III APPASSIONATO Was it a distant flute That breathed, and now is mute? Or that lost soul men call the nightingale. In bosky coverts hidden, Filling with sudden passion all the vale? O, chant again the tale, And call on her whose name returns, unbidden, A longing and a dream, Adelaïda! For while the sprinkled stars Sparkle, and wink, and gleam, Adelaïda! Darkness and perfume cleave the unknown bars Between the enamored heart and thee, And thou and I are free, Adelaïda! Less than a name, a melody, art thou, A hope, a haunting vow! The passion-cloven Spirit of thy Beethoven Claimed with less ardor than I claim thee now, Adelaïda! Take form, at last: from these o'erbending branches Descend, or from the grass arise! I scarce shall see thine eyes, Or know what blush the shadow stanches; But all my being's empty urn shall be Filled with thy mystery! IV CAPRICCIOSO Nay, nay! the longings tender, The fear, the marvel, and the mystery, The shy, delicious dread, the unreserved surrender, Give, if thou canst, to me! For I would be, In this expressive languor, While night conceals, the wooed and not the wooer; Shaken with supplication, keen as anger; Pursued, and thou pursuer! Plunder my bosom of its hoarded fire, And so assail me, That coy denial fail me, Slain by the mirrored shape of my desire! Though life seem overladen With conquered bliss, it only craves the more: Teach me the other half of passion's lore— Be thou the man, and I the maiden! Ah! come, While earth is waiting, heaven is dumb, And blossom-sighs So penetrate the indolent air, The very stars grow fragrant in the skies! Arise, And thine approach shall make me fair, Thy borrowed pleading all too soon subdue me, Till both forget the part; And she who failed to woo me So caught, is held to my impatient heart! 1873. THE GUESTS OF NIGHT I ride in a gloomy land, I travel a ghostly shore,— Shadows on either hand, Darkness behind and before; Veils of the summer night Dusking the woods I know; A whisper haunts the height, And the rivulet croons below. A waft from the roadside bank Tells where the wild-rose nods; The hollows are heavy and dank With the steam of the golden-rods: Incense of Night and Death, Odors of Life and Day, Meet and mix in a breath, Drug me, and lapse away. Is it the hand of the Past, Stretched from its open tomb, Or a spell from thy glamoury cast, O mellow and mystic gloom? All, wherein I have part, All that was loss or gain, Slips from the clasping heart, Breaks from the grasping brain. Lo, what is left? I am bare As a new-born soul,—I am naught; My deeds are as dust in air, My words are as ghosts of thought. I ride through the night alone, Detached from the life that seemed, And the best I have felt or known Is less than the least I dreamed. But the Night, like Agrippa's glass, Now, as I question it, clears; Over its vacancy pass The shapes of the crowded years; Meanest and most august, Hated or loved, I see The dead that have long been dust, The living, so dead to me! Place in the world's applause? Nay, there is nothing there! Strength from unyielding laws? A gleam, and the glass is bare. The lines of a life in song? Faint runes on the rocks of time? I see but a formless throng Of shadows that fall or climb. What else? Am I then despoiled Of the garments I wove and wore? Have I so refrained and toiled, To find there is naught in store? I have loved,—I love! Behold, How the steady pictures rise! And the shadows are pierced with gold From the stars of immortal eyes. Nearest or most remote, But dearest, hath none delayed; And the spirits of kisses float O'er the lips that never fade. The Night each guest denies Of the hand or haughty brain, But the loves that were, arise, And the loves that are, remain. 1871. SONNET Who, harnessed in his mail of Self, demands To be men's master and their sovran guide?— Proclaims his place, and by sole right of pride A candidate for love and reverence stands, As if the power within his empty hands Had fallen from the sky, with all beside, So oft to longing and to toil denied, That makes the leaders and the lords of lands? He who would lead must first himself be led; Who would be loved be capable of love Beyond the utmost he receives; who claims The rod of power must first have bowed his head, And, being honored, honor what's above: This know the men who leave the world their names. 1872. TO MARIE WITH A COPY OF THE TRANSLATION OF FAUST This plant, it may be, grew from vigorous seed, Within the field of study set by Song; Sent from its sprouting germ, perchance, a throng Of roots even to that depth where passions breed; Chose its own time, and of its place took heed; Sucked fittest nutriment to make it strong:— But you from every wayward season's wrong Did guard it, showering, at its changing need, Or dew of sympathy, or summer glow Of apprehension of the finer toil, And gave it, so, the nature that endures. Our secret this, the world can never know: You were the breeze and sunshine, I the soil: The form is mine, color and odor yours! 1875. CENTENNIAL HYMN O God of Peace! now o'er the world The armies rest, with banners furled: O God of Toil! beneath thy sight The toiling nations here unite; O God of Beauty, bend and see The Beautiful that shadows thee! Our land, young hostess of the West, Now first in festal raiment dressed, Invites from every realm and clime Her sisters of the elder time, And bare of shield, ungirt by sword, Bids welcome to her bounteous board. Thy will, dear Father, gave to each The force of hand, the fire of speech; Thy guidance led from low to high, Made failure still in triumph die, And set for all, in fields apart, The oak of Toil, the rose of Art! What though, within thy plan sublime, Our eras are the dust of time, Yet unto later good ordain This rivalry of heart and brain, And bless, through power and wisdom won, The peaceful cycle here begun! Let each with each his bounty spend, Now knowledge borrow, beauty lend! Let each in each more nobly see Thyself in him, his faith in Thee: All conquering power Thy gift divine, All glory but the seal of Thine! February, 1876. THE SONG OF 1876 I Waken, voice of the Land's Devotion! Spirit of freedom, awaken all! Ring, ye shores, to the Song of Ocean, Rivers, answer, and mountains, call! The golden day has come: Let every tongue be dumb, That sounded its malice or murmured its fears; She hath won her story; She wears her glory; We crown her the Land of a Hundred Years! II Out of darkness and toil and danger Into the light of Victory's day, Help to the weak, and home to the stranger, Freedom to all, she hath held her way! Now Europe's orphans rest Upon her mother-breast: The voices of Nations are heard in the cheers; That shall cast upon her New love and honor, And crown her the Queen of a Hundred Years! III North and South, we are met as brothers: East and West, we are wedded as one! Right of each shall secure our mother's; Child of each is her faithful son! We give Thee heart and hand, Our glorious native Land, For battle has tried thee, and time endears: We will write thy story, And keep thy glory, As pure as of old for a Thousand Years! 1876. IMPROVISATIONS I Through the lonely halls of the night My fancies fly to thee: Through the lonely halls of the night, Alone, I cry to thee. For the stars bring presages Of love, and of love's delight: Let them bear my messages Through the lonely halls of the night! In the golden porch of the morn Thou com'st anew to me: In the golden porch of the morn, Say, art thou true to me? If dreams have shaken thee With the call thou canst not scorn, Let Love awaken thee In the golden porch of the morn! II The rose of your cheek is precious; Your eyes are warmer than wine; You catch men's souls in the meshes Of curls that ripple and shine— But, ah! not mine. Your lips are a sweet persuasion; Your bosom a sleeping sea; Your voice, with its fond evasion, Is a call and a charm to me; But I am free! As the white moon lifts the waters, You lift the passions, and lead; As a chieftainess proud with slaughters, You smile on the hearts that bleed: But I take heed! III Come to me, Lalage! Girl of the flying feet, Girl of the tossing hair And the red mouth, small and sweet; Less of the earth than air, So witchingly fond and fair, Lalage! Touch me, Lalage! Girl of the soft white hand, Girl of the low white brow And the roseate bosom band; Bloom from an orchard bough Less downy-soft than thou, Lalage! Kiss me, Lalage! Girl of the fragrant breath, Girl of the sun of May; As a bird that flutters in death, My fluttering pulses say: If thou be Death, yet stay, Lalage! IV What if I couch in the grass, or listlessly rock on the waters? If in the market I stroll, sit by the beakers of wine? Witched by the fold of a cloud, the flush of a meadow in blossom, Soothed by the amorous airs, touched by the lips of the dew? First must be color and odor, the simple, unmingled sensation, Then, at the end of the year, apples and honey and grain. You, reversing the order, your barren and withering branches Vainly will shake in the winds, mine hanging heavy with gold! V Though thy constant love I share, Yet its gift is rarer; In my youth I thought thee fair; Thou art older and fairer! Full of more than young delight Now day and night are; For the presence, then so bright, Is closer, brighter. In the haste of youth we miss Its best of blisses: Sweeter than the stolen kiss, Are the granted kisses. Dearer than the words that hide The love abiding, Are the words that fondly chide, When love needs chiding. Higher than the perfect song For which love longeth, Is the tender fear of wrong, That never wrongeth. She whom youth alone makes dear May awhile seem nearer: Thou art mine so many a year, The older, the dearer! VI A grass-blade is my warlike lance, A rose-leaf is my shield; Beams of the sun are, every one My chargers for the field. The morning gives me golden steeds, The moon gives silver-white; The stars drop down, my helm to crown, When I go forth to fight. Against me ride in iron mail The squadrons of the foe: The bucklers flash, the maces crash, The haughty trumpets blow. One touch, and all, with armor cleft, Before me turn and yield. Straight on I ride: the world is wide; A rose-leaf is my shield! Then dances o'er the waterfall The rainbow, in its glee; The daisy sings, the lily rings Her bells of victory. So am I armed where'er I go, And mounted night or day: Who shall oppose the conquering rose, And who the sunbeam slay? VII The star o' the morn is whitest, The bosom of dawn is brightest; The dew is sown, And the blossom blown Wherein thou, my Dear, delightest. Hark, I have risen before thee, That the spell of the day be o'er thee; That the flush of my love May fall from above, And, mixed with the moon, adore thee! Dark dreams must now forsake thee, And the bliss of thy being take thee! Let the beauty of morn In thine eyes be born, And the thought of me awake thee! Come forth to hear thy praises, Which the wakening world upraises; Let thy hair be spun With the gold o' the sun, And thy feet be kissed by the daisies! VIII Near in the forest I know a glade; Under the tree-tops A secret shade! Vines are the curtains, Blossoms the floor; Voices of waters Sing evermore. There, when the sunset's Lances of gold Pierce, or the moonlight Is silvery cold, Would that an angel Led thee to me— So, out of loneliness Love should be! Never the breezes Should lisp what we say, Never the waters Our secret betray! Silence and shadow, After, might reign; But the old life be ours Never again! IX What if we lose the seasons That seem of our happiest choice, That Life is fuller of reasons To sorrow than rejoice, That Time is richer in treasons, And Hope has a faltering voice? The dreams wherewith we were dowered Were gifts of an ignorant brain; The truth has at last overpowered The visions we clung to in vain: But who would resist, as a coward. The knowledge that cometh from pain? For the love, as a flower of the meadow, The love that stands firm as a tree— For the stars that have vanished in shadow, The daylight, enduring and free— For a dream of the dim El Dorado, A world to inhabit have we! X Heart, in my bosom beating Fierce, as a power at bay! Ever thy rote repeating Louder, and then retreating. Who shall thy being sway? Over my will and under, Equally king and slave, Sometimes I hear thee thunder, Sometimes falter and blunder Close to the waiting grave! Oft, in the beautiful season, Restless thou art, and wild; Oft, with never a reason, Turnest and doest me treason, Treating the man as a child! Cold, when passion is burning, Quick, when I sigh for rest, Kindler of perished yearning, Curb and government spurning, Thou art lord of the breast! XI Fill, for we drink to Labor! And Labor, you know, is Prayer: I'll be as grand as my neighbor Abroad, and at home as bare! Debt, and bother, and hurry! Others are burdened so: Here 's to the goddess Worry, And here 's to the goddess Show! Reckless of what comes after, Silent of whence we come: Splendor and feat and laughter Make the questioners dumb. Debt, and bother, and hurry! Nobody needs to know: Here's to the goddess Worry, And here 's to the goddess Show! Fame is what you have taken, Character 's what you give: When to this truth you waken, Then you begin to live! Debt, and bother, and hurry Others have risen so: Here 's to the goddess Worry, And here 's to the goddess Show! Honor 's a thing for derision, Knowledge a thing reviled; Love is a vanishing vision, Faith is the toy of a child! Debt, and bother, and hurry! Honesty 's old and slow. Here 's to the goddess Worry, And here 's to the goddess Show! 1872–1875. MARIGOLD Homely, forgotten flower, Under the rose's bower, Plain as a weed, Thou, the half-summer long, Waitest and waxest strong, Even as waits a song Till men shall heed. Then, when the lilies die, And the carnations lie In spicy death, Over thy bushy sprays Burst with a sudden blaze Stars of the August days, With Autumn's breath. Fain would the calyx hold; But splits, and half the gold Spills lavishly: Frost, that the rose appalls, Wastes not thy coronals, Till Summer's lustre falls And fades in thee. 1876. WILL AND LAW Will, in his lawless mirth, Cried: “Mine be the sphere of Earth! Mine be the hills and seas, Night calm and morning breeze, Shadowed and sun-lit hours, Passions, delights, and powers, Each in its turn to choose, All to reject or use— Thus myself to fulfil, For I am Will!” Nature, with myriad mouth, Answered from North and South: “Back to the nest again, Dream of thy idle brain! Eyes shall open, and see Power attained through me: Mine the increasing days, Mine the delight that stays, Service from each to draw— For I am Law!” 1876. TRUE LOVE'S TIME OF DAY When shall I find you, sweetheart, That shall be and must be mine? I seek, though the world divides us, And I send you the secret sign. There 's blood in the veins of morning, So fresh it may well deceive, When man goes forth as Adam, And woman awaits him as Eve. There 's an elvish spell in twilight When the bats of Fancy fly, And sense is bound by a question, And Fate by the quick reply. And the moon is an old enchantress. With her snares of glimmer and shade, That have ever been false and fatal To the dreams of man and maid. But I'll meet you at noonday, sweetheart, In the billowy fields of grain, When the sun is hot for harvest, And you'll kiss me without reply. 1877. YOUTH Child with the butterfly, Boy with the ball, Youth with the maiden— Still I am all. Wisdom of manhood Keeps the old joy; Conquered illusions Leave me a boy. Falsehood and baseness Teach me but this: Earth still is beautiful, Being is bliss. Locks to my temples Hoary may cling; 'T is but as daisies On meadows of spring. 1876. THE IMP OF SPRINGTIME Over the eaves where the sunbeams fall Twitters the swallow; I hear from the mountains the cataract call: Follow, oh, follow! Buds on the bushes and blooms on the mead Swiftly are swelling; Hark! the Spring whispereth: “Make ye with speed Ready my dwelling.” Out of the tremulous blue of the air Calling before her, Who was it bade me “Awake and prepare, Thou mine adorer!” “Leave me,” I said; “I have known thee of old, Love the annoyer, Arming, at last, with thine arrows of gold, Time, the Destroyer.” “Follow,” he laughed, “where the bliss of the earth Wooes thee, compelling; Yet in the Spring, and her thousandfold birth, I, too, am dwelling.” Out of the buds he was peeping, and sang Soft with the swallow; Yea, and he called where the cataract sprang: Follow, oh, follow! Vain to defy, or evade, or, in sooth, Bid him to leave me! But his deception is dearer than truth: Let him deceive me! 1878. A LOVER'S TEST I sat to-day beneath the pine And saw the long lake shine. The wind was weary, and the day Sank languidly away Behind the forest's purple rim: The sun was fair for me, I lived for him! I did not miss you. All was sweet, Sky, earth, and soul complete In harmony, which could afford No more, nor spoil the chord. Could I be blest, and you afar, Were other I, or you, than what we are? The sifted silver of the night Rained down a strange delight; The moon's moist beams on meadows made Pale bars athwart the shade, And murmurs crept from tree to tree, Mysterious whispers—not from you to me! I stirred the embers, roused the brand And mused: on either hand The pedigree of human thought Sang, censured, cheered, or taught. Pausing at each Titanic line, I caught no echo of your soul to mine! At last, when life recast its form To passive rest and warm, Ere the soft, lingering senses cease In sleep's half-conscious peace, The wish I might have fashioned died In dreams that never brought you to my side! Farewell! my nature's highest stress Mine equal shall possess. 'T is easier to renounce, or wait, Haply, the perfect fate. My coldness is the haughty fire That naught consumes except its full desire! 1874. TO MY DAUGHTER Learn to live, and live to learn, Ignorance like a fire doth burn, Little tasks make large return. In thy labors patient be, Afterward, released and free, Nature will be bright to thee. Toil, when willing, groweth less; “Always play” may seem to bless, Yet the end is weariness. Live to learn, and learn to live, Only this content can give; Reckless joys are fugitive! 1872. A FRIEND'S GREETING TO J. G. WHITTIER, FOR HIS SEVENTIETH BIRTHDAY Snow-bound for earth, but summer-souled for thee, Thy natal morning shines: Hail, Friend and Poet. Give thy hand to me, And let me read its lines! For skilled in Fancy's palmistry am I, When years have set their crown; When Life gives light to read its secrets by, And deed explains renown. So, looking backward from thy seventieth year On service grand and free, The pictures of thy spirit's Past are clear, And each interprets thee. I see thee, first, on hills our Aryan sires In Time's lost morning knew, Kindling, as priest, the lonely altar-fires That from Earth's darkness grew. Then, wise with secrets of Chaldæan lore, In high Akkadian fane; Or pacing slow by Egypt's river-shore, In Thothmes' glorious reign. I hear thee, wroth with all iniquities That Judah's kings betrayed, Preach from Ain-Jidi's rock thy God's decrees, Or Mamre's terebinth shade. And, ah!—most piteous vision of the Past, Drawn by thy being's law, I see thee, martyr, in the arena cast, Beneath the lion's paw. Yet, afterwards, how rang thy sword upon The Paynim helm and shield! How shone with Godfrey, and at Askalon, Thy white plume o'er the field! Strange contradiction!—where the sand-waves spread The boundless desert sea, The Bedouin spearmen found their destined head, Their dark-eyed chief—in thee! And thou wert friar in Cluny's saintly cell, And Skald by Norway's foam, Ere fate of Poet fixed thy soul, to dwell In this New England home. Here art thou Poet,—more than warrior, priest; And here thy quiet years Yield more to us than sacrifice or feast, Or clash of swords or spears. The faith that lifts, the courage that sustains, These thou wert sent to teach: Hot blood of battle, beating in thy veins, Is turned to gentle speech. Not less, but more, than others hast thou striven; Thy victories remain: The scars of ancient hate, long since forgiven, Have lost their power to pain. Apostle pure of Freedom and of Right, Thou had'st thy one reward: Thy prayers were heard, and flashed upon thy sight The Coming of the Lord! Now, sheathed in myrtle of thy tender songs, Slumbers the blade of truth; But Age's wisdom, crowning thee, prolongs The eager hope of Youth! Another line upon thy hand I trace, All destinies above: Men know thee most as one that loves his race, And bless thee with their love! 1877. PEACH-BLOSSOM I Nightly the hoar-frost freezes The young grass of the field, Nor yet have blander breezes The buds of the oak unsealed: Not yet pours out the pine His airy resinous wine; But over the southern slope, In the heat and hurry of hope, The wands of the peach-tree first Into rosy beauty burst: A breath, and the sweet buds ope! A day, and the orchards bare, Like maids in haste to be fair, Lightly themselves adorn With a scarf the Spring at the door Has sportively flung before, Or a stranded cloud of the morn! II What spirit of Persia cometh And saith to the buds, “Unclose!” Ere ever the first bee hummeth, Or woodland wild flower blows? What prescient soul in the sod Garlands each barren rod With fringes of bloom that speak Of the baby's tender breast, And the boy's pure lip unpressed, And the pink of the maiden's cheek? The swift, keen Orient so Prophesies as of old, While the apple's blood is cold, Remembering the snow. III Afar, through the mellow hazes Where the dreams of June are stayed, The hills, in their vanishing mazes, Carry the flush, and fade! Southward they fall, and reach To the bay and the ocean beach, Where the soft, half-Syrian air Blows from the Chesapeake's Inlets and coves and creeks On the fields of Delaware! And the rosy lakes of flowers, That here alone are ours, Spread into seas that pour Billow and spray of pink Even to the blue wave's brink, All down the Eastern Shore! IV Pain, Doubt, and Death are over! Who thinks, to-day, of toil? The fields are certain of clover, The gardens of wine and oil. What though the sap of the North Drowsily peereth forth In the orchards, and still delays? The peach and the poet know Under the chill the glow, And the token of golden days! V What fool, to-day, would rather In wintry memories dwell? What miser reach to gather The fruit these boughs foretell? No, no!—the heart has room For present joy alone, Light shed and sweetness blown, For odor and color and bloom! As the earth in the shining sky, Our lives in their own bliss lie; Whatever is taught or told, However men moan and sigh, Love never shall grow cold, And Life shall never die! 1876. ASSYRIAN NIGHT-SONG I There is naught, on either hand, But the moon upon the sand. Pale and glimmering, far and dim, To the Desert's utmost rim, Flows the inundating light Over all the lands of Night. Bel, the burning lord, has fled: In her blue, uncurtained bed, Ishtar, bending from above, Seeks her Babylonian love. Silver-browed, forever fair, Goddess of the dusky hair And the jewel-sprinkled breast, Give me love, or give me rest! II I have wandered lone and far As the ship of Izdubar, When the gathered waters rose High on Nizir's mountain snows, Drifting where the torrent sped Over life and glory dead. Hear me now! I stretch my hands From the moon-sea of the sands Unto thee, or any star That was guide to Izdubar! Where the bulls with kingly heads Guard the way to palace-beds, Once I saw a woman go, Swift as air and soft as snow, Making swan and cypress one, Steel and honey, night and sun,— Once of death I knew the sting: Beauty queen—and I not king! III Where the Hanging Gardens soar Over the Euphrates' shore, And from palm and clinging vine Lift aloft the Median pine, Torches flame and wine is poured, And the child of Bel is lord! I am here alone with thee, Ishtar, daughter of the Sea, Who of woven dew and air Spread'st an ocean, phantom-fair, With a slow pulse beating through Wave of air and foam of dew. As I stand, I seem to drift With its noiseless fall and lift, While a veil of lightest lawn, Or a floating form withdrawn, Or a glimpse of beckoning hands Gleams and fades above the sands. IV Day, that mixed my soul with men, Has it died forever, then? Is there any world but this? If the god deny his bliss, And the goddess cannot give, What are gods, that men should live? Lo! the sand beneath my feet Hoards the bounty of its heat, And thy silver cheeks I see Bright with him who burns for thee. Give the airy semblance form, Bid the dream be near and warm; Or, if dreams but flash and die As a mock to heart and eye, Then descend thyself, and be, Ishtar, sacred bride to me! 1876. MY PROLOGUE I If heat of youth, 'tis heat suppressed That fills my breast: The childhood of a voiceless lyre Preserves my fire. I chanted not while I was young; But ere age chill, I liberate my tongue! II Apart from stormy ways of men, Maine's loneliest glen Held me as banished, and unheard I saved my word: I would not know the bitter taste Of the crude fame which falls to them that haste. III On each impatient year I tossed A holocaust Of effort, ashes ere it burned, And justly spurned. If now I own maturer days. I know not: dust to me is passing praise. IV But out of life arises song, Clear, vital, strong— The speech men pray for when they pine, The speech divine No other can interpret: grand And permanent as time and race and land. V I dreamed I spake it: do I dream, In pride supreme, Or, like late lovers, found the bride Their youth denied, Is this my stinted passion's flow? It well may be; and they that read will know. 1874. GABRIEL I Once let the Angel blow!— A peal from the parted heaven, The first of seven! For the time is come that was foretold So long ago! As the avalanche gathers, huge and cold, From the down of the harmless snow, The years and the ages gather and hang Till the day when the word is spoken: When they that dwell in the end of time Are smitten alike for the early crime As the vials of wrath are broken! II Yea, the time hath come; Though Earth is rich, her children are dumb! Ye cry: Beware Of the dancer's floating hair, And the cymbal's clash, and the sound of pipe and drum! But the Prophet cries: Beware Of the hymn unheard, the unanswered prayer; For ignorance is past, And knowledge comes at last, And the burden it brings to you how can ye bear? III Again let the Angel blow! The seals are loosened that seemed to bind The Future's bliss and woe! For a shrinking soul, an uncertain mind, For eyes that see, but are growing blind, Your landmarks fade and change: The colors to-day you borrow Take another hue to-morrow; The forms of your faith are wild and strange! Walking, you stagger to and fro: So, let the Angel blow! IV Ah, shall the Angel blow? Something must have remained, Something fresh and unstained, Sprung from the common soil where the virtues grow: Nay, it is not so! Art succumbs to the coarser sense, Greed o'ercometh sweet abstinence; Of vices young men talk, In scarlet your women walk, And the soul of honor that made you proud, The loftier grace your lives avowed, Are a passive corpse and a tattered shroud: What you forget, can your children know? So, let the Angel blow! V Yes, let the Angel blow! A peal from the parted heaven, The first of seven;— The warning, not yet the sign, of woe! That men arise And look about them with wakened eyes, Behold on their garments the dust and slime, Refrain, forbear, Accept the weight of a nobler care And take reproach from the fallen time! 1874. THE LOST CARYATID When over Salamis stands Homer's moon, And from the wasted wave Of spent Ilissus falls no liquid croon, But tears that wet a grave; When on Pentelicus the quarried scars Are dusk as dying stars; When Attica's gray olives blend and gleam Like sea-mists o'er the plain; And, islanded in Time's eternal stream, Only Athenè's fane Shines forth, when every light of heaven must kiss Art's one Acropolis: Then, unto him—the modern Hellenes say— In whom old dreams survive; For whom the force of each immortal day Earth knew, is yet alive— To him who waits and listens there alone, Rises a strange, sweet moan. The voice of broken marble, the complaint Of beauty nigh despair, In the thick wilderness of years grown faint For lack of rite and prayer, Since all perfection, making her sublime, Provoked her evil time. It floats around the Panathenaic frieze Till every triglyph sings, While up from Dionysian chairs the breeze A murmurous answer brings; But most it gathers voice, and rests upon The spoiled Erechtheion. There the white architrave that fronts the east Lightly five sisters hold As blossom-baskets at a bridal feast, Or jars of Samian gold: Each proud and pure, and still a glorious wraith Of Beauty wed to Faith! The sixth has vanished, from the service torn, Long since, by savage hands, And keeps dumb vigil where the misty morn Creeps o'er Cimmerian lands; While they, in pallid lip and dew-damp cheek Lament, and seem to speak: “Where art thou, sister? Thee, the sparkling day, The moonbeam finds no more, Save in some hall where darker gods decay On some barbarian shore! Ah, where, beyond Poseidon's bitter foam, Hear'st thou the voice of home? “Where, when, as now, the night's mysterious hush Our ancient life renews, Or when the tops of Corydallus flush O'er the departing dews— And lovely Attica, in silver spread, Forgets that she is dead— “Bidest thou in exile? Speak! Our being cold,— Thou knowest!—yet retains The thrill of choric strophes, flutes of gold, And all victorious strains. Dark is the world that knows not us divine; But, ah! what fate is thine?” Lo! from afar, across unmeasured seas An answering sound is blown, As when some wind-god's ghost moves Thessaly's Tall pines to solemn tone; Yet happy, as a sole Arcadian flute, When harvest-fields are mute. “I hear ye, sisters!”—thus the answer falls: “My marble sends reply To you, who guard the fair, immortal halls Beneath our ancient sky; Yet give no sadder echo to your moan,— I am not here alone! “Dark walls surround me; that keen azure fire Of day and night is fled; Yet worship clothes me, and the old desire That round your feet is dead: I see glad eyes, I feel fresh spirits burn, And beauteous faith return! “What idle hand or scornful set me here I heed no longer now; Men know my loveliness, and, half in fear, Touch mine insulted brow: In me the glory of the gods discrowned The race again has found. “Move proudly, sisters, bear your architrave Without me, whom ye miss! Truth finds her second birthplace, not her grave, On our Acropolis! And children here, while there but aliens roam, Shall build once more our home.” 1877. THE VILLAGE STORK The old Hercynian Forest sent His weather on the plain; Wahlwinkel's orchards writhed and bent In whirls of wind and rain. Within her nest, upon the roof, For generations tempest-proof, Wahlwinkel's stork with her young ones lay, When the hand of the hurricane tore away The house and the home that held them. The storm passed by; the happy trees Stood up, and kissed the sun; And from the birds new melodies Came fluting one by one. The stork, upon the paths below, Went sadly pacing to and fro, With dripping plumes and head depressed, For she thought of the spoiled ancestral nest, And the old, inherited honor. “Behold her now!” the throstle sang From out the linden tree; “Who knows from what a line she sprang, Beyond the unknown sea?” “If she could sing, perchance her tale Might move us,” chirruped the nightingale. “Sing? She can only rattle and creak!” Whistled the bullfinch, with silver beak, Within the wires of his prison. And all birds there, or loud or low, Were one in scoff and scorn; But still the stork paced to and fro, As utterly forlorn. Then suddenly, in turn of eye, She saw a poet passing by, And the thought in his brain was an arrow of fire, That pierced her with passion, and pride, and ire, And gave her a voice to answer. She raised her head and shook her wings, And faced the piping crowd. “Best service,” said she, “never sings, True honor is not loud. My kindred carol not, nor boast; Yet we are loved and welcomed most, And our ancient race is dearest and first, And the hand that hurts us is held accursed In every home of Wahlwinkel! “Beneath a sky forever fair, And with a summer sod, The land I come from smiles—and there My brother was a god! My nest upon a temple stands And sees the shine of desert lands; And the palm and the tamarisk cool my wings, When the blazing beam of the noonday stings, And I drink from the holy river! “There I am sacred, even as here; Yet dare I not be lost, When meads are bright, hearts full of cheer, At blithesome Pentecost. Then from mine obelisk I depart, Guided by something in my heart, And sweep in a line over Libyan sands To the blossoming olives of Grecian lands, And rest on the Cretan Ida! “Parnassus sees me as I sail; I cross the Adrian brine; The distant summits fade and fail, Dalmatian, Apennine; The Alpine snows beneath me gleam, I see the yellow Danube stream; But I hasten on till my spent wings fall Where I bring a blessing to each and all, And babes to the wives of Wahlwinkel!” She drooped her head and spake no more; The birds on either hand Sang louder, lustier than before— They could not understand. Thus mused the stork, with snap of beak: “Better be silent, than so speak! Highest being can never be taught: They have their voices, I my thought; And they were never in Egypt!” August, 1878. ODES 1869–1878 GETTYSBURG ODE DEDICATION OF THE NATIONAL MONUMENT, JULY 1, 1869 I After the eyes that looked, the lips that spake Here, from the shadows of impending death, Those words of solemn breath, What voice may fitly break The silence, doubly hallowed, left by him? We can but bow the head, with eyes grown dim, And, as a Nation's litany, repeat The phrase his martyrdom hath made complete, Noble as then, but now more sadly-sweet: “Let us, the Living, rather dedicate Ourselves to the unfinished work, which they Thus far advanced so nobly on its way, And save the perilled State! Let us, upon this field where they, the brave, Their last full measure of devotion gave, Highly resolve they have not died in vain!— That, under God, the Nation's later birth Of Freedom, and the people's gain Of their own Sovereignty, shall never wane And perish from the circle of the earth!” From such a perfect text, shall Song aspire To light her faded fire, And into wandering music turn Its virtue, simple, sorrowful, and stern? His voice all elegies anticipated; For, whatsoe'er the strain, We hear that one refrain: “We consecrate ourselves to them, the Consecrated!” II After the thunder-storm our heaven is blue: Far-off, along the borders of the sky, In silver folds the clouds of battle lie, With soft, consoling sunlight shining through; And round the sweeping circle of your hills The crashing cannon-thrills Have faded from the memory of the air; And Summer pours from unexhausted fountains Her bliss on yonder mountains: The camps are tenantless, the breastworks bare: Earth keeps no stain where hero-blood was poured: The hornets, humming on their wings of lead, Have ceased to sting, their angry swarms are dead, And, harmless in its scabbard, rusts the sword! III O, not till now,—O, now we dare, at last, To give our heroes fitting consecration! Not till the soreness of the strife is past, And Peace hath comforted the weary Nation! So long her sad, indignant spirit held One keen regret, one throb of pain, unquelled; So long the land about her feet was waste, The ashes of the burning lay upon her, We stood beside their graves with brows abased, Waiting the purer mood to do them honor! They, through the flames of this dread holocaust, The patriot's wrath, the soldier's ardor, lost: They sit above us and above our passion, Disparaged even by our human tears,— Beholding truth our race, perchance, may fashion In the slow process of the creeping years. We saw the still reproof upon their faces; We heard them whisper from the shining spaces: “To-day ye grieve: come not to us with sorrow! Wait for the glad, the reconciled To-morrow! Your grief but clouds the ether where we dwell; Your anger keeps your souls and ours apart: But come with peace and pardon, all is well! And come with love, we touch you, heart to heart!” IV Immortal Brothers, we have heard! Our lips declare the reconciling word: For Battle taught, that set us face to face, The stubborn temper of the race, And both, from fields no longer alien, come, To grander action equally invited,— Marshalled by Learning's trump, by Labor's drum, In strife that purifies and makes united! We force to build, the powers that would destroy; The muscles, hardened by the sabre's grasp, Now give our hands a firmer clasp: We bring not grief to you, but solemn joy! And, feeling you so near, Look forward with your eyes, divinely clear, To some sublimely-perfect, sacred year, When sons of fathers whom ye overcame Forget in mutual pride the partial blame, And join with us, to set the final crown Upon your dear renown,— The People's Union in heart and name! V And yet, ye Dead!—and yet Our clouded natures cling to one regret: We are not all resigned To yield, with even mind, Our scarcely-risen stars, that here untimely set. We needs must think of History that waits For lines that live but in their proud beginning,— Arrested promises and cheated fates,— Youth's boundless venture and its single winning! We see the ghosts of deeds they might have done, The phantom homes that beaconed their endeavor; The seeds of countless lives, in them begun, That might have multiplied for us forever! We grudge the better strain of men That proved itself, and was extinguished then— The field, with strength and hope so thickly sown, Wherefrom no other harvest shall be mown: For all the land, within its clasping seas, Is poorer now in bravery and beauty, Such wealth of manly loves and energies Was given to teach us all the freeman's sacred duty! VI Again 't is they, the Dead, By whom our hearts are comforted. Deep as the land-blown murmurs of the waves The answer cometh from a thousand graves: “Not so! we are not orphaned of our fate! Though life were warmest, and though love were sweetest, We still have portion in their best estate: Our fortune is the fairest and completest! Our homes are everywhere: our loves are set In hearts of man and woman, sweet and vernal: Courage and Truth, the children we beget, Unmixed of baser earth, shall be eternal. A finer spirit in the blood shall give The token of the lines wherein we live,— Unselfish force, unconscious nobleness That in the shocks of fortune stands unshaken,— The hopes that in their very being bless, The aspirations that to deeds awaken! If aught of finer virtue ye allow To us, that faith alone its like shall win you; So, trust like ours shall ever lift the brow; And strength like ours shall ever steel the sinew! We are the blossoms which the storm has cast From the Spring promise of our Freedom's tree, Pruning its overgrowths, that so, at last, Its later fruit more bountiful shall be!— Content, if, when the balm of Time assuages The branch's hurt, some fragrance of our lives In all the land survives, And makes their memory sweet through still expanding ages!” VII Thus grandly, they we mourn, themselves console us; And, as their spirits conquer and control us, We hear, from some high realm that lies beyond, The hero-voices of the Past respond. From every State that reached a broader right Through fiery gates of battle; from the shock Of old invasions on the People's rock; From tribes that stood, in Kings' and Priests' despite; From graves, forgotten in the Syrian sand, Or nameless barrows of the Northern strand, Or gorges of the Alps and Pyrenees, Or the dark bowels of devouring seas,— Wherever Man for Man's sake died,—wherever Death stayed the march of upward-climbing feet, Leaving their Present incomplete, But through far Futures crowning their endeavor,— Their ghostly voices to our ears are sent, As when the high note of a trumpet wrings Æolian answers from the strings Of many a mute, unfingered instrument! Platæan cymbals thrill for us to-day; The horns of Sempach in our echoes play, And nearer yet, and sharper, and more stern, The slogan rings that startled Bannockburn; Till from the field, made green with kindred deed, The shields are clashed in exultation Above the dauntless Nation, That for a Continent has fought its Runnymede! VIII Aye, for a Continent! The heart that beats With such rich blood of sacrifice Shall, from the Tropics, drowsed with languid heats, To the blue ramparts of the Northern ice, Make felt its pulses, all this young world over!— Shall thrill, and shake, and sway Each land that bourgeons in the Western day, Whatever flag may float, whatever shield may cover! With fuller manhood every wind is rife, In every soil are sown the seeds of valor, Since out of death came forth such boundless life, Such ruddy beauty out of anguished pallor! And that first deed, along the Southern wave, Spoiled not the sister-land, but lent an arm to save! IX Now, in her seat secure, Where distant menaces no more can reach her, Our land, in undivided freedom pure, Becomes the unwilling world's unconscious teacher; And, day by day, beneath serener skies, The unshaken pillars of her palace rise,— The Doric shafts, that lightly upward press, And hide in grace their giant massiveness. What though the sword has hewn each corner-stone And precious blood cements the deep foundation! Never by other force have empires grown; From other basis never rose a nation! For strength is born of struggle, faith of doubt, Of discord law, and freedom of oppression: We hail from Pisgah, with exulting shout, The Promised Land below us, bright with sun, And deem its pastures won, Ere toil and blood have earned us their possession! Each aspiration of our human earth Becomes an act through keenest pangs of birth; Each force, to bless, must cease to be a dream, And conquer life through agony supreme; Each inborn right must outwardly be tested By stern material weapons, ere it stand In the enduring fabric of the land, Secured for these who yielded it, and those who wrested! X This they have done for us who slumber here,— Awake, alive, though now so dumbly sleeping; Spreading the board, but tasting not its cheer, Sowing, but never reaping;— Building, but never sitting in the shade Of the strong mansion they have made;— Speaking their word of life with mighty tongue, But hearing not the echo, million-voiced, Of brothers who rejoiced, From all our river vales and mountains flung! So take them, Heroes of the songful Past! Open your ranks, let every shining troop Its phantom banners droop, To hail Earth's noblest martyrs, and her last! Take them, O Fatherland! Who, dying, conquered in thy name; And, with a grateful hand, Inscribe their deed who took away thy blame,— Give, for their grandest all, thine insufficient fame! Take them, O God! our Brave, The glad fulfillers of Thy dread decree; Who grasped the sword for Peace, and smote to save, And, dying here for Freedom, also died for Thee! SHAKESPEARE'S STATUE CENTRAL PARK, NEW YORK, MAY 23, 1872 I In this free Pantheon of the air and sun, Where stubborn granite grudgingly gives place To petted turf, the garden's daintier race Of flowers, and Art hath slowly won A smile from grim, primeval barrenness, What alien Form doth stand? Where scarcely yet the heroes of the land, As in their future's haven, from the stress Of all conflicting tides, find quiet deep Of bronze or marble sleep, What stranger comes, to join the scanty band? Who pauses here, as one that muses While centuries of men go by, And unto all our questioning refuses His clear, infallible reply? Who hath his will of us, beneath our new-world sky? II Here, in his right, he stands! No breadth of earth-dividing seas can bar The breeze of morning, or the morning star, From visiting our lands: His wit, the breeze, his wisdom, as the star, Shone where our earliest life was set, and blew To freshen hope and plan In brains American,— To urge, resist, encourage, and subdue! He came, a household ghost we could not ban: He sat, on winter nights, by cabin fires; His summer fairies linked their hands Along our yellow sands; He preached within the shadow of our spires; And when the certain Fate drew nigh, to cleave The birth-cord, and a separate being leave, He, in our ranks of patient-hearted men, Wrought with the boundless forces of his fame, Victorious, and became The Master of our thought, the land's first Citizen! III If, here, his image seem Of softer scenes and grayer skies to dream, Thatched cot and rustic tavern, ivied hall, The cuckoo's April call And cowslip-meads beside the Avon stream, He shall not fail that other home to find We could not leave behind! The forms of Passion, which his fancy drew, In us their ancient likenesses beget: So, from our lives forever born anew, He stands amid his own creations yet! Here comes lean Cassius, of conventions tired; Here, in his coach, luxurious Antony Beside his Egypt, still of men admired; And Brutus plans some purer liberty! A thousand Shylocks, Jew and Christian, pass; A hundred Hamlets, by their times betrayed; And sweet Anne Page comes tripping o'er the grass, And antlered Falstaff pants beneath the shade. Here toss upon the wanton summer wind The locks of Rosalind; Here some gay gloved the damnèd spot conceals Which Lady Macbeth feels: His ease here smiling smooth Iago takes, And outcast Lear gives passage to his woe, And here some foiled Reformer sadly breaks His wand of Prospero! In liveried splendor, side by side, Nick Bottom and Titania ride; And Portia, flushed with cheers of men, Disdains dear, faithful Imogen; And Puck, beside the form of Morse, Stops on his forty-minute course; And Ariel from his swinging bough A blossom casts on Bryant's brow, Until, as summoned from his brooding brain, He sees his children all again, In us, as on our lips, each fresh, immortal strain! IV Be welcome, Master! In our active air Keep the calm strength we need to learn of thee! A steadfast anchor be 'Mid passions that exhaust, and times that wear! Thy kindred race, that scarcely knows What power is in Repose, What permanence in Patience, what renown In silent faith and plodding toil of Art That shyly works apart, All these in thee unconsciously doth crown! V The Many grow, through honor to the One; And what of loftier life we do not live, This Form shall help to give, In our free Pantheon of the air and sun! Here, where the noise of Trade is loudest, It builds a shrine august, To show, while pomp of wealth is proudest, How brief is gilded dust: How Art succeeds, though long, And o'er the tumult of the generations, The strong, enduring spirit of the nations, How speaks the voice of Song! Our City, at her gateways of the sea, Twines bay around the mural crown upon her, And wins new grace and dearer dignity, Giving our race's Poet honor! If such as he Again may ever be, And our humanity another crown Find in some equal, late renown, The reverence of what he was shall call it down! GOETHE NEW YORK, AUGUST 28, 1875 I Whose voice shall so invade the spheres That, ere it die, the Master hears? Whose arm is now so strong To fling the votive garland of a song, That some fresh odor of a world he knew With large enjoyment, and may yet Not utterly forget, Shall reach his place, and whisper whence it grew? Dare we invoke him, that he pause On trails divine of unimagined laws, And bend the luminous eyes Experience could not dim, nor Fate surprise, On these late honors, where we fondly seem, Him thus exalting, like him to aspire, And reach, in our desire, The triumph of his toil, the beauty of his dream! II God moulds no second poet from the clay Time once hath cut in marble: when, at last, The veil is plucked away, We see no face familiar to the Past. New mixtures of the elements, And fresh espousals of the soul and sense, At first disguise The unconjectured Genius to our eyes, Till self-nursed faith and self-encouraged power Win the despotic hour That bids our doubting race accept and recognize! III Ah, who shall say what cloud of disregard, Cast by the savage ancient fame Of some forgotten name, Mantled the Chian bard? He walked beside the strong, prophetic sea, Indifferent as itself, and nobly free; While roll of waves and rhythmic sound of oars Along Ionian shores, To Troy's high story chimed in undertone, And gave his song the accent of their own! What classic ghost severe was summoned up To threaten Dante, when the bitter bread Of exile on his board was spread, The bitter wine of bounty filled his cup? We need not ask: the unpropitious years, The hate of Guelf, the lordly sneers Of Della Scala's court, the Roman ban, Were but as eddying dust To his firm-centred trust; For through that air without a star Burned one unwavering beacon from afar, That kept him his and ours, the stern, immortal man! What courtier, stuffed with smooth, accepted lore Of Song's patrician line, But shrugged his velvet shoulders all the more, And heard, with bland, indulgent face, As who bestows a grace, The homely phrase that Shakespeare made divine? So, now, the dainty souls that crave Light stepping-stones across a shallow wave, Shrink from the deeps of Goethe's soundless song! So, now, the weak, imperfect fire That knows but half of passion and desire Betrays itself, to do the Master wrong;— Turns, dazzled by his white, uncolored glow, And deems his sevenfold heat the wintry flash of snow! IV Fate, like a grudging child, Herself once reconciled To power by loss, by suffering to fame; Weighing the Poet's name With blindness, exile, want, and aims denied; Or let faint spirits perish in their pride; Or gave her justice when its need had died; But as if weary she Of struggle crowned by victory, Him with the largesse of her gifts she tried! Proud beauty to the boy she gave: A lip that bubbled song, yet lured the bee; An eye of light, a forehead pure and free; Strength as of streams, and grace as of the wave! Round him the morning air Of life she charmed, and made his pathway fair; Lent Love her lightest chain, That laid no bondage on the haughty brain, And cheapened honors with a new disdain: Kept, through the shocks of Time; For him the haven of a peace sublime, And let his sight forerun The sown achievement, to the harvest won! V But Fortune's darling stood unspoiled: Caressing Love and Pleasure, He let not go the imperishable treasure: He thought, and sported; carolled free, and toiled: He stretched wide arms to clasp the joy of Earth, But delved in every field Of knowledge, conquering all clear worth Of action, that ennobles through the sense Of wholly used intelligence: From loftiest pinnacles, that shone revealed In pure poetic ether, he could bend To win the little store Of humblest Labor's lore, And give each face of Life the greeting of a friend! He taught, and governed,—knew the thankless days Of service and dispraise; He followed Science on her stony ways; He turned from princely state to heed The single nature's need, And, through the chill of hostile years, Never unlearned the noble shame of tears! Faced by fulfilled Ideals, he aspired To win the perished secret of their grace,— To dower the earnest children of a race Toil never tamed, nor acquisition tired, With Freedom born of Beauty!—and for them His Titan soul combined The passions of the mind, Which blood and time so long had held apart, Till the white blossom of the Grecian Art The world saw shine once more, upon a Gothic stem! VI His measure would we mete? It is a sea that murmurs at our feet. Wait, first, upon the strand: A far shore glimmers—“knowest thou the land?” Whence these gay flowers that breathe beside the water? Ask thou the Erl-King's daughter! It is no cloud that darkens thus the shore: Faust on his mantle passes o'er. The water roars, the water heaves, The trembling waves divide: A shape of beauty, rising, cleaves The green translucent tide. The shape is a charm, the voice is a spell; We yield, and dip in the gentle swell. Then billowy arms our limbs entwine, And, chill as the hidden heat of wine, We meet the shock of the sturdy brine; And we feel, beneath the surface-flow, The tug of the powerful undertow, That ceaselessly gathers and sweeps To broader surges and darker deeps; Till, faint and breathless, we can but float Idly, and listen to many a note From horns of the Tritons flung afar; And see, on the watery rim, The circling Dorides swim, And Cypris, poised on her dove-drawn car! Torn from the deepest caves, Sea-blooms brighten the waves The breaker throws pearls on the sand, And inlets pierce to the heart of the land, Winding by dorf and mill, Where the shores are green and the waters still, And the force, but now so wild, Mirrors the maiden and sports with the child! Spent from the sea, we gain its brink, With soul aroused and limbs aflame: Half are we drawn, and half we sink But rise no more the same. VII O meadows threaded by the silver Main! O Saxon hills of pine, Witch-haunted Hartz, and thou, Deep vale of Ilmenau! Ye knew your poet; and not only ye: The purple Tyrrhene Sea Not murmurs Virgil less, but him the more; The Lar of haughty Rome Gave the high guest a home: He dwells with Tasso on Sorrento's shore! The dewy wild-rose of his German lays, Beside the classic cyclamen, In many a Sabine glen, Sweetens the calm Italian days. But pass the hoary ridge of Lebanon, To where the sacred sun Beams on Schiràz; and lo! before the gates, Goethe, the heir of Hafiz, waits. Know ye the turbaned brow, the Persian guise, The bearded lips, the deep yet laughing eyes? A cadence strange and strong Fills each voluptuous song, And kindles energy from old repose; Even as first, amid the throes Of the unquiet West, He breathed repose to heal the old unrest! VIII Dear is the Minstrel, yet the Man is more; But should I turn the pages of his brain, The lighter muscle of my verse would strain And break beneath his lore. How charge with music powers so vast and free, Save one be great as he? Behold him, as ye jostle with the throng Through narrow ways, that do your beings wrong, Self-chosen lanes, wherein ye press In louder Storm and Stress, Passing the lesser bounty by Because the greater seems too high, And that sublimest joy forego, To seek, aspire, and know! Behold in him, since our strong line began, The first full-statured man! Dear is the Minstrel, even to hearts of prose; But he who sets all aspiration free Is dearer to humanity. Still through our age the shadowy Leader goes; Still whispers cheer, or waves his warning sign; The man who, most of men, Heeded the parable from lips divine, And made one talent ten! THE NATIONAL ODE INDEPENDENCE SQUARE, PHILADELPHIA, JULY 4, 1876 I.—1. Sun of the stately Day Let Asia into the shadow drift, Let Europe bask in thy ripened ray, And over the severing ocean lift A brow of broader splendor! Give light to the eager eyes Of the Land that waits to behold thee rise; The gladness of morning lend her, With the triumph of noon attend her, And the peace of the vesper skies! For, lo! she cometh now With hope on the lip and pride on the brow, Stronger, and dearer, and fairer, To smile on the love we bear her,— To live, as we dreamed her and sought her, Liberty's latest daughter! In the clefts of the rocks, in the secret places, We found her traces; On the hills, in the crash of woods that fall, We heard her call; When the lines of battle broke, We saw her face in the fiery smoke; Through toil, and anguish, and desolation, We followed, and found her With the grace of a virgin Nation As a sacred zone around her! Who shall rejoice With a righteous voice, Far-heard through the ages, if not she? For the menace is dumb that defied her, The doubt is dead that denied her, And she stands acknowledged, and strong, and free! II.—1. Ah, hark! the solemn undertone, On every wind of human story blown. A large, divinely-moulded Fate Questions the right and purpose of a State, And in its plan sublime Our eras are the dust of Time. The far-off Yesterday of power Creeps back with stealthy feet, Invades the lordship of the hour, And at our banquet takes the unbidden seat. From all unchronicled and silent ages Before the Future first begot the Past, Till History dared, at last, To write eternal words on granite pages; From Egypt's tawny drift, and Assur's mound, And where, uplifted white and far, Earth highest yearns to meet a star, And Man his manhood by the Ganges found,— Imperial heads, of old millennial sway, And still by some pale splendor crowned, Chill as a corpse-light in our full-orbed day, In ghostly grandeur rise And say, through stony lips and vacant eyes: “Thou that assertest freedom, power, and fame, Declare to us thy claim!” I.—2. On the shores of a Continent cast, She won the inviolate soil By loss of heirdom of all the Past, And faith in the royal right of Toil! She planted homes on the savage sod: Into the wilderness lone She walked with fearless feet, In her hand the divining-rod, Till the veins of the mountains beat With fire of metal and force of stone! She set the speed of the river-head To turn the mills of her bread; She drove her ploughshare deep Through the prairie's thousand-centuried sleep, To the South, and West, and North, She called Pathfinder forth, Her faithful and sole companion Where the flushed Sierra, snow-starred, Her way to the sunset barred, And the nameless rivers in thunder and foam Channelled the terrible canyon! Nor paused, till her uttermost home Was built, in the smile of a softer sky And the glory of beauty still to be, Where the haunted waves of Asia die On the strand of the world-wide sea! II.—2. The race, in conquering, Some fierce, Titanic joy of conquest knows; Whether in veins of serf or king, Our ancient blood beats restless in repose. Challenge of Nature unsubdued Awaits not Man's defiant answer long; For hardship, even as wrong, Provokes the level- eyed heroic mood. This for herself she did; but that which lies, As over earth the skies, Blending all forms in one benignant glow,— Crowned conscience, tender care, Justice that answers every bondman's prayer, Freedom where Faith may lead and Thought may dare, The power of minds that know, Passion of hearts that feel, Purchased by blood and woe, Guarded by fire and steel,— Hath she secured? What blazon on her shield, In the clear Century's light Shines to the world revealed, Declaring nobler triumph, born of Right? I.—3. Foreseen in the vision of sages, Foretold when martyrs bled, She was born of the longing of ages, By the truth of the noble dead And the faith of the living fed! No blood in her lightest veins Frets at remembered chains, Nor shame of bondage has bowed her head. In her form and features still The unblenching Puritan will, Cavalier honor, Huguenot grace, The Quaker truth and sweetness, And the strength of the danger-girdled race Of Holland, blend in a proud completeness. From the homes of all, where her being began, She took what she gave to Man; Justice, that knew no station, Belief, as soul decreed, Free air for aspiration, Free force for independent deed! She takes, but to give again, As the sea returns the rivers in rain; And gathers the chosen of her seed From the hunted of every crown and creed. Her Germany dwells by a gentler Rhine; Her Ireland sees the old sunburst shine; Her France pursues some dream divine; Her Norway keeps his mountain pine; Her Italy waits by the western brine; And, broad-based under all, Is planted England's oaken-hearted mood, As rich in fortitude As e'er went worldward from the island-wall! Fused in her candid light, To one strong race all races here unite: Tongues melt in hers, hereditary foemen Forget their sword and slogan, kith and clan: 'T was glory, once, to be a Roman: She makes it glory, now, to be a man! II.—3. Bow down! Doff thine æonian crown! One hour forget The glory, and recall the debt: Make expiation, Of humbler mood, For the pride of thine exultation O'er peril conquered and strife subdued! But half the right is wrested When victory yields her prize. And half the marrow tested When old endurance dies. In the sight of them that love thee, Bow to the Greater above thee! He faileth not to smite The idle ownership of Right, Nor spares to sinews fresh from trial, And virtue schooled in long denial, The tests that wait for thee In larger perils of prosperity. Here, at the Century's awful shrine, Bow to thy Father's God, and thine! I.—4. Behold! she bendeth now, Humbling the chaplet of her hundred years: There is a solemn sweetness on her brow, And in her eyes are sacred tears. Can she forget, In present joy, the burden of her debt, When for a captive race She grandly staked, and won, The total promise of her power begun, And bared her bosom's grace To the sharp wound that inly tortures yet? Can she forget The million graves her young devotion set, The hands that clasp above, From either side, in sad, returning love? Can she forget, Here, where the Ruler of to-day, The Citizen of to-morrow, And equal thousands to rejoice and pray Beside these holy walls are met, Her birth-cry, mixed of keenest bliss and sorrow? Where, on July's immortal morn Held forth, the People saw her head And shouted to the world: “The King is dead, But, lo! the Heir is born!” When fire of Youth, and sober trust of Age, In Farmer, Soldier, Priest, and Sage, Arose and cast upon her Baptismal garments,—never robes so fair Clad prince in Old-World air,— Their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor! II.—4. Arise! Recrown thy head, Radiant with blessing of the Dead! Bear from this hallowed place The prayer that purifies thy lips, The light of courage that defies eclipse, The rose of Man's new morning on thy face! Let no iconoclast Invade thy rising Pantheon of the Past, To make a blank where Adams stood, To touch the Father's sheathed and sacred blade, Spoil crowns on Jefferson and Franklin laid, Or wash from Freedom's feet the stain of Lincoln's blood! Hearken, as from that haunted Hall Their voices call: “We lived and died for thee; We greatly dared that thou might'st be: So, from thy children still We claim denials which at last fulfil, And freedom yielded to preserve thee free! Beside clear-hearted Right That smiles at Power's uplifted rod, Plant Duties that requite, And Order that sustains, upon thy sod, And stand in stainless might Above all self, and only less than God! III.—1. Here may thy solemn challenge end, All-proving Past, and each discordance die Of doubtful augury, Or in one choral with the Present blend, And that half-heard, sweet harmony Of something nobler that our sons may see! Though poignant memories burn Of days that were, and may again return, When thy fleet foot, O Huntress of the Woods, The slippery brinks of danger knew, And dim the eyesight grew That was so sure in thine old solitudes,— Yet stays some richer sense Won from the mixture of thine elements, To guide the vagrant scheme, And winnow truth from each conflicting dream! Yet in thy blood shall live Some force unspent, some essence primitive, To seize the highest use of things; For Fate, to mould thee to her plan, Denied thee food of kings, Withheld the udder and the orchard-fruits, Fed thee with savage roots, And forced thy harsher milk from barren breasts of man! III.—2. O sacred Woman-Form, Of the first People's need and passion wrought,— No thin, pale ghost of Thought, But fair as Morning and as heart's-blood warm,— Wearing thy priestly tiar on Judah's hills; Clear-eyed beneath Athene's helm of gold; Or from Rome's central seat Hearing the pulses of the Continents beat In thunder where her legions rolled; Compact of high heroic hearts and wills, Whose being circles all The selfless aims of men, and all fulfils; Thyself not free, so long as one is thrall; Goddess, that as a Nation lives, And as a Nation dies, That for her children as a man defies, And to her children as a mother gives,— Take our fresh fealty now! No more a Chieftainess, with wampum-zone And feather-cinctured brow,— No more a new Britannia, grown To spread an equal banner to the breeze, And lift thy trident o'er the double seas; But with unborrowed crest, In thine own native beauty dressed,— The front of pure command, the unflinching eye, thine own! III.—3. Look up, look forth, and on! There 's light in the dawning sky: The clouds are parting, the night is gone: Prepare for the work of the day! Fallow thy pastures lie, And far thy shepherds stray, And the fields of thy vast domain Are waiting for purer seed Of knowledge, desire, and deed, For keener sunshine and mellower rain! But keep thy garments pure: Pluck them back, with the old disdain, From touch of the hands that stain! So shall thy strength endure. Transmute into good the gold of Gain, Compel to beauty thy ruder powers, Till the bounty of coming hours Shall plant, on thy fields apart, With the oak of Toil, the rose of Art! Be watchful, and keep us so: Be strong, and fear no foe: Be just, and the world shall know! With the same love love us, as we give; And the day shall never come, That finds us weak or dumb To join and smite and cry In the great task, for thee to die, And the greater task, for thee to live! THE OBSEQUIES IN ROME JANUARY 17, 1878 I Victor Emanuel!—of prophetic name, Who, crowned in sore defeat, Caught out of blood, disaster, and retreat, With wounded hands, a soldier's simple fame,— Content, had that been all, And most content, victoriously to fall:— Life saved thee for a people's holiest aim, And leaves thee Victor, in thy pall! “God WITH US” may that people say, Who walk behind thy conquering dust, to-day: Yea, all thine Italy Made one, at last, and proudly free, Blesses thy sire's baptismal prophecy! II Since, over-coarse to be the Empire's lord, Herulian Odoàker fell Among spilled goblets, by the Gothic sword, In old Ravenna's palace citadel; And, after him, Theodoric strove To own the land he could not choose but love;— And both, from no deficiency of power, But failing heart and brain That might revivify the beauty slain. Builded barbaric thrones for one brief hour;— Since, in a glorious vision cast By some narcotic opiate of the Past, Rienzi sought to be Brutus in deed, Cæsar in victory,— The Italy, that once was Rome, Dismembered, sighed for her deliverance, Saw her Republics die, Leaned vainly on the broken reed of France, Till, when despair seemed nigh, She knew herself, and, starting from her trance, Summoned the Victor, who hath led her home! III He knew his people, and his soul was strong To wait till they knew him: The hand that holds a sceptre dare not shake From the quick blood that burns at every wrong. With Europe watchful, cold and grim Behind him, and the triple-hooded snake Coiled in his path, he went Through changing gusts of doubt and discontent, Till all he could have dreamed of, came to him! But now his people know him!—now, Since Death's pure coronet is on his brow, Italian eyes are dim! Now to her ancient glories sovereign Rome Adds one more glory: sorrow falls O'er all the circuit of the Aurelian walls,— Even from Montorio on Saint Peter's dome: And where on warm Pamfili-Dorian meads Fresh dew the daisy feeds; And breathes in every tall Borghese pine, And moans on Aventine; And—could the voice of all desire awake That once was loud for Italy's dear sake,— A hymn would burst from each dumb burial-stone Beside the Cestian pyramid, Where Keats's, Shelley's dust is hid, In dithyrambic triumph o'er his own! IV Who walk behind his bier? Behold the solemn phantoms!—who are they, The stern precursors that arise, to-day, Breathing of many a fiery year And clad in drapery of a darker time? These are the dead who saw, Too soon, the world's diviner law,— Too early dreamed their people's dream sublime! He follows them, who lived to make that dream A principle supreme, Dome-browed Mazzini,—he, who planted sure Its corner-stone, Cavour! Then, first among the living, that gray chief Who wears, at last, his Roman laurel's leaf, To conquer which he rent and shattered down His rich Sicilian crown. Ah, bend thee, Garibaldi!—be not loth To trust the son of him thou gav'st a land, Or kiss the stainless hand Of her whose name is pearl and daisy both! Such love, to-day, thy people give To him who died, such trust to them who live. V Cunning nor Force shall overthrow The State whose fabric has been builded so. Under the Pantheon's dome, The undying Victor still shall reign O'er one free land that dare not feel a chain,— Whose mighty heart is Rome! Still, from the ramparts of the Rhætian snow, Far down the realms of corn and wine, Back-boned by Apennine, To capes that breast the warm Calabrian Sea, A single race shall know One love, one right, one loyalty:— Still from his ashes Italy shall grow, Who made her Italy! EPICEDIUM WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT I Say, who shall mourn him first, Who sang in days for Song so evil-starred, Shielding from adverse winds the flame he nursed,— Our Country's earliest Bard? For all he sang survives In stream, and tree, and bird, and mountain-crest, And consecration of uplifted lives To Duty's stern behest; Till, like an echo falling late and far As unto Earth the answer from a star, Along his thought's so nigh unnoted track Our people's heart o'ertakes His pure design, and hears him, and awakes To breathe its music back! Approach, sad Forms, now fitly to employ The grave, sweet stops of all melodious sound, Yet undertoned with joy; For him ye lose, at last is truly found. II Scarce darkened by the shadow of these hours, The Manitou of Flowers, Crowned with the Painted-cup, that shakes Its gleam of war-paint on his dusky cheek, Goes by, but cannot speak; Yet tear or dew-drop 'neath his coronal breaks, And in his drooping hand The azure eyelids of the gentian die That loves the yellow autumn land The wind-flower, golden-rod, With phlox and orchis, nod; And every blossom frail and shy No careless loiterer sees, But poet, sun and breeze, And the bright countenance of our western sky. They know who loved them; they, if all Forgot to dress his pall, Or strew his couch of long repose, Would from the prairies and the central snows The sighing west-wind call, Their withered petals, even as tears, to bear, And, like a Niobe of air, Upon his sea-side grave to let them fall! III Next you, ye many Streams, That make a music through his cold green land! Whether ye scour the granite slides In broken spray-light or in sheeted gleams, Or in dark basins stand, Your bard's fond spirit in your own abides. Not yours the wail of woe, Whose joy is in your wild and wanton flow,— Chill, beautiful Undines That flash white hands behind your thicket-screens, And charm the wildwood and the cloven flumes To hide you in their glooms! But he hath kissed you, and his lips betray Your coyest secrets; now, no more Your bickering, winking tides shall stray Through August's idle day, Or showered with leaves from brown November's floor, Untamed, and rich in mystery As ye were wont to be! From where the dells of Greylock feed Your thin, young life, to where the Sangamon Breaks with his winding green the Western mead, Delay to hasten on! Ask not the clouds and hills To swell the veins of your obedient rills, And brim your banks with turbid overflow; But calmly, soothly go, Soft as a sigh and limpid as a tear, So that ye seem to borrow The voice and the visage of sorrow, For he gave you glory and made you dear! IV Strong Winds and mighty Mountains, sovereign Sea, What shall your dirges be? The slow, great billow, far down the shore, Booms in its breaking: “Dare—and despair!” The fetterless winds, as they gather and roar, Are evermore crying: “Where, oh where?” The mountain summits, with ages hoar, Say: “Near and austere, but far and fair!” Shall ye in your sorrow droop, Who are strong and sad, and who cannot stoop? Two may sing to him where he lies, But the third is hidden behind the skies. Ye cannot take what he stole, And made his own in his inmost soul! The pulse of the endless Wave Beauty and breadth to his strophes gave; The Winds with their hands unseen Held him poised at a height serene; And the world that wooed him, he smiled to o'ercome it; Whose being the Mountains made so strong,— Whose forehead arose like a sunlighted summit Over eyes that were fountains of thought and song! V And last, ye Forms, with shrouded face Hiding the features of your woe, That on the fresh sod of his burial-place Your myrtle, oak, and laurel throw,— Who are ye?—whence your silent sorrow? Strange is your aspect, alien your attire: Shall we, who knew him, borrow Your unknown speech for Grief's august desire? Lo! one, with lifted brow Says: “Nay, he knew and loved me: I am Spain!” Another: “I am Germany, Drawn sadly nearer now By songs of his and mine that make one strain, Though parted by the world-dividing sea!” And from the hills of Greece there blew A wind that shook the olives of Peru, Till all the world that knew, Or, knowing not, shall yet awake to know The sweet humanity that fused his song,— The haughty challenge unto Wrong, And for the trampled Truth his fearless blow,— Acknowledge his exalted mood Of faith achieved in song-born solitude, And give him high acclaim With those who followed Good, and found it Fame! VI Ah, no!—why should we mourn The noble life, that wore its crown of years? Why drop these tender, unavailing tears Upon a fate of no fulfilment shorn? He was too proud to seek That which should come unasked; and came, Kindling and brightening as a wind-blown flame When he had waited long, And life—but never art—was weak, But youthful will and sympathy were strong In white-browed eye and hoary-bearded cheek; Until, when called at last That later life to celebrate, Wherein, dear Italy, for thine estate, The glorious Present joined the glorious Past, He fell, and ceased to be! We could not yield him grandlier than thus, When, for thy hero speaking, he Spake equally for us!— His last word, as his first, was Liberty! His last word, as his first, for Truth Struck to the heart of age and youth: He sought her everywhere, In the loud city, forest, sea, and air: He bowed to wisdom other than his own, To wisdom and to law, Concealed or dimly shown In all he knew not, all he knew and saw, Trusting the Present, tolerant of the Past, Firm-faithed in what shall come When the vain noises of these days are dumb; And his first word was noble as his last! Berlin, September, 1878.</field>
