      <field name="fulltext">A Group of Selections EVE, AT THE BURIAL OF ABEL And this is death! the beamless eyeâ The cold and faded brow: I've seen our boy in slumber lie, But oh! 'twas not as now. For then his young lip wore a smile, And health was on his cheek, And bright and lovely all the while, He seemed of joy to speak. He is not hereâthe soul hath sought Its native home in Heaven; And when or how it matters not, That dust to dust is given! Cold let the turf above him lie, The flowers around him spring, For even to a mother's eye This sight no joy can bring. And let him 'neath his altar lie, His joy in life was there; 'Tis hallowed by his memory, And sanctified with prayer, And when his fate shall be our own, And earthly toil shall cease, Beneath that consecrated stone, May we, too, sleep in peace. Stanzas 1, 7, 8 Haverhill Gazette, January 26, 1826 THE EXECUTION OF LOUIS XVI He clung to hope e'en at the hour Appointed for his doom, Its generous but deceitful power Shone o'er his spirit's gloom. When, on the scaffold, hope had flown, No terrors then to him were known. Calmly and with a steadfast eye He gazed on that death scene, The block, the axe, the headsman nigh, On whose ill-boding mien, A reckless, sullen hatred writ, Revealed a heart for murder fit. He sought to speakâthe numbers round Beheld the sign he made, Each voice was hushed and stilled each sound, An awful silence laid On the dark crowds that rolled before, Like ocean waves with ceaseless roar. He spoke, the trumpet's deafening yell, The drums discordant roar, In cruel murmurs round him fell, And he was heard no more, In vain the anxious crowd pressed nighâ They only came to see him die. His last, his only hope was crushed In vain he sought to speak, Despair upon his spirit rushed, And tears upon his cheek. His pride, his energy was gone, And thrice he wildly cried, âUndone.â Ah! he had hoped by his appeal To rouse a nation's pride To bid the loyal grasp the steel, And hasten to his side. That hope was past, the headsman stood Impatient for the scene of blood. He bent him to the fearful block With horror-glaring eye, His neck was bared to meet the stroke, The axe was lifted high. The shuddering crowd with straining eyes, Looked on the place of sacrifice. The pale priest spoke, âAscend to Heaven, St. Louis' royal son.â He ceasedâthe fatal blow was given, The deed abhorred was done. The bleeding head was lifted high And âVive la nationâ rose the cry. But fury flashed from many an eye, That saw the deed of guilt, And many a hand unconsciously Grasped on the dagger's hilt. Stearn vengeance until then supprest, Flamed high in many a loyal breast. Unhallowed deed! Columbia well May shed, with grief endued, O'er him who thus despairing fell, The tear of gratitude. He was her friend in danger's hour, Her bulwark, 'gainst a tyrant's power. Haverhill Gazette, January 6, 1827 MICAH IV, 3 A time shall come, when strife shall fail, Its terrors all shall die; And warriors, linked in battle mail No longer shall defy. The trumpet's sound, the clarion's breath, Shall rouse no more to scenes of death. The war-tried spear, the crimson blade, Once lifted to destroy, The cause of industry shall aid, And heighten human joy. The sword that flashed with baleful glare, Shall form the scythe and plowman's share. He who on fields with slaughter red, Looked round with tearless eye, And urged his war-horse o'er the dead With fiendish apathy, Shall cast his blood-bought spoils away, And turn to mild angelic sway. Thrice happy hour! haste on thy way, Thou, whose untiring flight, Hast left the scenes of earlier day, Wrapt in oblivion's night, And bring the glorious moment nigh, When peace shall reign and strife shall die. Haverhill Gazette, January 13, 1827 THE RESTORATION Baruch, Chapter V Put off, O fair Salem! thy garments of mourning, The robe which in days of affliction was thine; Again in thy strength and thy splendor returning, Again the pure light of thine altars shall shine. For a garment around thee, Be righteousness worn; Let the gemmed crown of glory Thy temples adorn. Arise, O fair city! the brightness of Heaven Shall scatter the gloom that envelopes thy name; To crown all thy honors, to thee shall be given Mild-spirited peace, and unchangeable fame. The beams of thy glory Shall lighten the earth, And men of all nations Shall bow to thy worth. Arise! look around! see thy sons without number, Enraptured, draw near from the east and the west! In thy blissful retreat shall the worn spirit slumber, The mourner rejoice, and the weary find rest. From hate and oppression Thy sons shall return; In the land of the stranger No longer to mourn. Each hill shall sink low in the vale it frowned over, And level the path of thy childhood shall be; Safe shall they pass, for the arm of Jehovah Shall screen them from harm as they hasten to thee, To the home of their fathers, The weary shall come, And the foe shall no longer Compel them to roam. Haverhill Gazette, January 27, 1827 LINES On the death of Martha Jane, daughter of Nathan Chase, aged three years and three months. Rest happy child! thy transient day To sorrow's wasting pangs unknown, Like some bright vision passed away, Scarce witnessed ere forever flown. Thy life was innocentâunmixed With vice or passion's mad controlâ 'Twas past, ere earth-born guilt had fixed Its sinful blight upon thy soul. Departed one! affection's sigh Must whisper round thy memory's shrine, And teardrops dim the anxious eye That oft so fondly gazed on thine. But oh! let those who mourn thy doom, Whose hearts with deep-felt griefs are riven, Inspired by hope, beyond thy tomb, Look up confidingly to Heaven. Haverhill Gazette, January 27, 1827 THE EVE OF BATTLE From âRecollections of a Soldier,â an unpublished poem The sun had set, the winds were still, And night drew round the camp-crowned hill Her misty mantleâo'er the sky Unnumbered beacons burst to view, And slow the heavy clouds passed by, Deep tinged with evening's sombre hue. I wandered forth.âThe tented grounds No longer shook with war-like sounds. The soldier's arm was nerveless now; The frown of hate had left his brow, And night restored with gentle sway Those spirits, which the toils of day Had broken, and the charm of sleep, Oblivious, spirit-soothing, deep, With magic power had chased away The terrors of the coming fray. The moon shone out above a cloud, That veiled awhile her silvering ray; Her brightness pierced its dusky shroud, And rolled the scattered gloom away. I saw the foeman's banners gleam In moonlight o'er a neighboring heightâ Proud banners! which were soon to stream High o'er the thunder-cloud of fight. I saw their watchful sentries glide, Where, far along the rude hillside, Couched on their arms, the foemen lay, All waiting for the dawn of day, When, rousing from the thrall of sleep, The mad'ning trumpet-call should sweep Aside each thought that dared to stray From martial feat, and battle-bray; When, mingling in the throng of fight, The gleaming spear and axe of might, The fiery crest, the bowing plume, The flashing eye and brow of gloom Should rouse the warrior's sternest power, To meet the horrors of the hour. There is a solemn power in night, To day's bright imagery unknown, When, gliding to the memory's sight, The visions of the past are shown. O, never from my mind will be Erased the memory of that hour, When dreams of glory's pageantry Gave place to thoughts of softer power. I thought of those with whom I passed Youth's golden hour! when fancy cast Her sun-bright radiance on my way, When hope, too, lent its powerful ray. I thought of her I left behind When, to her fond affection blind, I hastened to the scene of death, To win a name in slaughter's path! O, these were thoughts which well might wean A heart like mine from battle's scene. Haverhill Gazette, February 3, 1827 HOPE Gay visions of hope! be ye near on the day When the phantoms of sorrow encumber my way; And when memory lingers with sorrowing eye, To gaze on the wrecks of the past, be ye nighâ Still point to the future, and promise me joy Which grief cannot darken, nor mem'ry alloy. Bright sunshine of hope! let thy gladdening ray Chase the darkness of wo from life's varying way; Let the gloom of regret from thy radiance depart, And no longer o'er shadow the joys of my heart. Let thy light-giving glories beam evermore there, To free it from all the dull mists of despair. Star of hope! though the night of misfortune should fall On the dreams of my spirit, and darken them all, Though adversity stretch her dark wings on my path And pour on my head all her vials of wrathâ To lighten my woes, when all else is denied, Be thou the fair beacon my footsteps to guide. Haverhill Gazette, February 10, 1827 THE SUN âThy years must have an end. Thou wilt sleep in thy clouds careless of the voice of the morning.â Ossian Thou sun, whose earth-pervading rays, Light of the world! hath shone, Since first thy night-dissolving blaze Was o'er thy darkness thrownâ O, ever till the tide of time Shall cease its troubled flow, The light, the joy of every clime, Shall be thy peerless glow. Thou hast seen earth's generations fall, Her mightiest pass away; Thou hast lighted up the grassy pall, Where her sons of glory lay. The gates of Thebes, the gilded towers That told of Trojan pride, That met thy beam in morning hours, And flashed its radiance wide, They are fallen nowâand thou hast seen Their ruins melt away; Thou hast marked the ivy's shroud of green, Steal o'er their slow decay. Yet thou shalt sink like thoseâthy light Will vanish from on high, No more to chase the shadowy night, Or paint the evening sky. But man, whose worksâwhose mortal form In awful ruin lies, Beyond the earth's dissolving storm, And death's pale realm shall rise. A holier and a brighter day Than thine, O Sun, shall dawn Upon his soul, when thy quenched ray Has ceased to hail the morn. Haverhill Gazette, February 17, 1827 CHARLES EDWARD AFTER THE BATTLE OF CULLODEN (Tune: âThe Young Troubadourâ) God save the young Chieftain! he wanders alone, Forever cast out from his kingdom and throne; Yet proud is the sorrow, and manly the tear That falls for the heroâthe young Chevalier. The march of his armies was gallant and proud, As they covered the hills like a sun-gilded cloud; The glance of the banner, the broadsword and spear, Flashed light on the path of the young Chevalier. The heart of his country beat high at his call, And the chiefs and the clansmen came fast from the hall The eye of the aged was bright with a tear As he prayed for the arms of the young Chevalier. For when their wild war cry arose on the air, The voice and the fire of past ages were there; And their souls were of flame as the moment came near To bleed for the kingâand the young Chevalier. A dark change of spirit came over them soon! It struck to their souls like a midnight at noon; Away from the battle dispersed like the deer They fled from their fame and the young Chevalier. He sighed for the shame of his friends who had fled; He sighed for the living and envied the dead; Who, fallen like the leaves on the grave of the year, Had breathed their last sigh for the young Chevalier. God save the young Chieftain! while far and unknown He flies from his country, his kingdom and throne; The heart of the loyal is bleeding to hear The fame and the fall of the young Chevalier. Boston Statesman, February 17, 1827 THE SONG OF PEACE âThe battle ceased along the plain, for the bards had sung the song of peace.â Ossian O, joy was in the well-known strain, Poured from that minstrel throng, As o'er the corse-encumbered plain, Their high and holy song Came, on the rushing breezes borne, The messenger of peace, To still the din of the battle horn, And bid the carnage cease. Hushed was the strife, controlled By that peace-proclaiming strain, The parted waves of the battle rolled From off the reeking plain. O, potent was the sound, That called the warrior back From the strength of his hard-gained ground, And the routed foemen's track. O, soothing to the ear Of the wounded, crushed and low, Were the tones that stayed the lifted spear, And the fiercely falling blow. Ye bards, whose visions swell The glories of our age, Say, have your mighty lays no spell To calm the warrior's rage? No! 'tis not this you seekâ No meed for this you claim! 'Tis yours, in glowing terms to speak Of the warrior's deathless name. Ye tell of the fame that falls Around the mighty dead, Who, following glory's trumpet-calls, In the throng of strife hath bled. Heaven-hallowed peace! to thee, A bard to fame unknown, Would dedicate his minstrelsy, And thy sweet influence own. And O! had he the power of song Which loftier spirits feel, The joys that to thy sway belong, His visions should reveal. Haverhill Gazette, February 24, 1827 THE WANDERER'S RETURN He had roamed, where over flood and vale Helvetia's mountains frowned, Their dark sides clothed in rocky mail, Their hoary summits crowned With snows unknown to earthly stainâ Assailed by summer suns in vain. He had seen the sunlight gild the towers And ancient hills of Rome; He had listened in Iberia's bowers To the muleteer's song of home; He had seen the silvering moonlight play Where Venice on her islands lay. He had seen the flowery laurel wave O'er Virgil's place of rest, And the torrents of the deep Rhone lave The banks that Petrarch pressedâ He had wandered in the orange grove Where that love bard had sung of love. Each scene had charmsâeach o'er his soul Enchanting visions brought, And dreams of yore by moments stole Upon his raptured thought, Where mouldering tower, or classic clime, Unclosed the scroll of olden time. But deeper far were rapture's thrills, And purer the delight! When, safe from all a wanderer's ills, The joy-inspiring sight Of home's green vales, its streams and bowers, Called back the dreams of childhood's hours. Haverhill Gazette, March 3, 1827 TO SARAH The hour in which we met has come again, When one more year is added to our woes, One other wearied round of deadening pain With darkened tide, still grimly onward flows. Though friends are gone, though weeds grow o'er the grave Of those who loved us when our hopes were greenâ Though tempests round our young sweet flowers rave, To cause a curse that they should e'er have been, Yet still we are, and still we yet must be, Poor breathing monuments of love and wrong, Bright chilly icebergs on a summer sea, Which melt beneath the sunbeam of a song. And why is woe our unavailing lot? Why stays the arrow from the bow of Fate? Oh! could this world but say that we are not, And that our space of life is desolateâ And could we soar from this relentless sphere, To untried worlds, which may be yet more chill, The change were pleasure, though the damning tear Should flow more deeply from its shore of ill. But worlds like this were never made for thee, Thou never could'st have once been formed to die, There is a spirit-stirring ecstasy, Within thy soul, formed for eternity. The lingering sickness and the mouldering wane, Which hover o'er our fairest jubilee, Depicted on thy face in living pain, Were never made, my dearest one, for thee. Then let us haste from this unhallowed scene, To that which ne'er can rival this in woe; Where chilling death can never intervene With fears like those, alas, which now we knowâ Oh! be it ever ill or blessedness, If but beside thee there is still delight To watch o'er thee in joy or in distress, So thou wilt never wing from me thy flight. Boston Statesman, March 8, 1827 THE QUAKER Who comes with his hat-brim resembling the wing Of the bird which old Sinbad the mariner saw? Such hats must be surely admirable things, The wearer to shield from the elements' war. And his coat! view it and you ever will know it; In its roundabout fashion how oddly it suits! His vest with long pocket flaps hanging below it, With drab-colored breeches and old-fashioned boots! Me, from such strange beings may Providence saveâ I tell you, Horatio, he seems to my view, Like one of our ancestors crept from his grave, The fashions prevailing in old times to shew; For I'm certain no rational man would have crowded Himself into notice exciting our gaze When in such unseemly habiliments shrouded; Save one of the gentry of primitive days. Beware, my good friend, and revile not too rashly A person you know not, because of his dress; For, believe me, the man you have pictured so harshly, Does many a noble endowment possess. True, he has not decked out his humble exterior In those fast varying fashions of vanity bornâ To such idle allurements his mind is superior 'Tis his mind, not his person he seeks to adorn. He stands in the vortex of folly and fashion, A mark for the sneers of the vulgar and rude, Yet beholding them all with the eye of compassion, And lamenting that pride was their reason subdued. Then let him pass on with his broad slouching hat, His roundabout coat and his boots of old fashion; Since his heart is adorned, notwithstanding all that, With the bright gems of meekness, of truth and compassion. Haverhill Gazette, March 17, 1827 HAROUN By the ruins of Palmyra (From âHaroun,â an unfinished poem) Time-mouldered ruins! still ye wear A semblance of your ancient pride! E'en now your moss-grown columns bear A grandeur which the wasting tide Of thronging years could not efface; Although in their o'erwhelming wave, Has sunk each record that might trace The name and power of those who gave Such splendor to the desert plain, When, bursting through the twilight's dun, Tall tower and marble-columned fane, Was lighted by Arabia's sun. Pillar and column! ivy wrapt, Scathed by the desert's blasting storms, Full many a son of pride has slept For ages neath your wasted forms. They sleep forgottenâyou alone, Despite of time, remain to tell That here ambition's toils were knownâ That here a city rose and fell. They are no moreâstern Time has thrown The shroud of years their memories o'er, Their glorious deeds no longer known, Awake the voice of praise no more. Glory and fame! oh what are they, But meteor gleams whose flowing light, Illumine a moment life's dark way, And leave it wrapt in deeper night. Haverhill Gazette, March 24, 1827 TO SARAH Thou once didst doubt, my lovely one, My faith and truth as though they were Like wintry clouds unshone upon By love, which once was flashing thereâ But all was cold within my breast, As is the frozen lake at rest. But no reproachânay, not a sigh, Was borne upon thy honied breath; A lone despair was in thine eye, Foretelling all of woe, of death. Thy frame was bending as the rose Droops at a summer evening's close. And couldst thou smile, aye, when the dart Was quivering in thy fond heart's blood: Oh, couldst thou see thy dreams depart, Chased by my black ingratitude; And yet love on in tenderness, The author of thy deep distress. Yet thou art undeceived at last, For sunny days again are thine; Those clouds that threatened us are past, And thou, pure lovely one, art mine. Come careâthe many wrinkled brow Has naught of peril for me now. Fair oneâwhose soul is purity, Looks on this world, as though 'twere given, By a behest of Deity, But as a resting place toward heavenâ What offering worthy of thy shrine, Could come from this poor heart of mine. There is a deep responseâit wells From that bright fount, that bubbling sea, Of Conscience, which within me smiles And speaks,ââLet me be worthy thee.â Boston Statesman, March 27, 1827 PSALM 137 Euphrates' stormy tide Rolled hoarsely murmuring on, We sat upon its sounding side, And thought of moments gone. Remembrance of our home was nigh, Of Salem's shrines we thoughtâ Tears glistened in each captive's eye, With mournful wildness fraught. The warrior's sigh, the matron's wail Was mingled in the passion gale. Unstrung on willow trees, That o'er the waters flung Their shadows varied by the breeze, Our tuneless harps were hung, And scornful foes, exulting o'er Our nation's nameless wrongs, Bade us awake their chords once more, With Zion's holy songs, With strains that erst were wont to fill The altars on her hallowed hill. How could we raise the song Within the stranger's land? Could we the sacred notes prolong Amidst a pagan band? O Salem! if I thee forget, If Zion's holy hill Depart from my remembrance, let My hand forget its skill, To touch the harp with sweetness strong, And deathless silence chain my tongue. Haverhill Gazette, April 1, 1827 THE LYRE âThere is a living spirit in the lyre.â Montgomery Grant me the spirit of the Lyre, And skill to touch its tuneful strings; Breathe on my soul a poet's fire, And fancy's pure imaginings: Then let the storms of fortune fall, In darkness round the dawning day, Let torturing memory lift the pall Of gone-by years, discovering all The joys which time hath swept away. Oh! I will smile amid the storm, If laurels of the lyre adorn My brow, though penury rear her form, And proud ones dart the glance of scorn. The breathings of the minstrel's lyre Remain when he who gave them birth, And touched their strains with living fire, Has passed beyond the thrall of earth. And far their quenchless beacon glow, On time's oblivious tide appears, In all their mournful forms to show The wrecks that throng its course, and throw A light upon the tomb of years. Minstrels of power! your deathless lays, First roused my heart with rapture high, And kindled in that heart a blaze, Partaking of your energy. High masters of the Lyre! what though Between us ocean's surges roll, They cannot check the rapturous flow Of joys that worldlings never knowâ The pure communion of the soul. Haverhill Gazette, April 21, 1827 UPON THE INSANE HOSPITAL (From Miss C. G. A's. Album) Oh who that feel the arrow of despair Rankling within the heart's blood-gushing core Would not with rapture hail that soothing care Which plucked the dart, and bid it pain no more. But there are ills, so shapeless, undefined, Which come in bitter wakings and in dreams, Pouring their burning waters o'er the mind, In scorching floods, like Etna's lava streams. The tale is trueâlook at yon haggard thing, Which starts in horror at the sea-bird's cryâ Who sees a demon in each flitting wing Which thought may brush across his memory. Alas âhis wits are lostââfrail memory's glass, With all his hopes and visionings are brokenâ All of his bye-gone joys are but a mass Of present illâhimself the living token. Within thy walls, bright monument of good, The scattered links of Reason oft are joinedâ Then take this humble meed of gratitude It comes from thy blessed votary, the mind. Boston Statesman, May 10, 1827 LINES Written after reading Lord Byron's description of a tempest among the Alps. âMost glorious night! Thou wert not sent for slumberâlet me be A sharer in thy fierce and far delightâ A portion of the tempest and of thee.â Bard of the lofty spirit! thou, When sternly burst the midnight storm On many a darkened Alpine brow, And Jura's cloud-enveloped form, Could'st smile amid the lightning's glare, And listen with intense delight, When thunders shook the mountain air, And storm-winds swept the caverned height! Thine was a spirit that might well Rejoice at nature's wildest mood; And when the tempest fiercely fell Amid that frowning solitude, Hold converse with the appalling scene, Invoke the genius of the storm, And with a high and dauntless mien, Confront his lightning-withered form. Oh! what to thee were sunny rills, Or flower-gemmed green, or stainless sky, The light mist wreathing on thy hills, Or morn's or sunset's pageantry? The midnight tempest was thy choice, For 'twas an emblem of thy soulâ The sweeping torrent's awful voice, The thunder's long-repeated roll, Could find an echo in thy breast. The scowling clouds that hung around Time-hallowed Jura's storm-proof crest, And clothed its peaks in gloom profound, Had less of darkness than the night Which gathered round thy mental eyeâ A darkness fraught with power to blight The noblest charms of poesy. Haverhill Gazette, May 19, 1827 A TWILIGHT SONG Listen, Love to me While night's dew is fallingâ Softly from yon tree, Thine own bird is callingâ Yes, hear him trill, No song of ill, 'Tis love, love, alone; Then listen, Love to me, Under this oaken tree, Ere yet his notes are gone. The pearl's purest beam Is when the moonlight gleam, Shines on the gem; And thy glowing eyes Where bright pleasure lies Will rival them; Then turn on me thy glance, And whisper words of bliss; Make brighter visions dance, Make mine, true happiness. Spirits now are seen, Twining greenest wreaths; Hark! from yonder glen, Music's love note breathes. Speak! lovely one, and wake Hopes that cannot die; Speak! beauteous one, and take, A full heart's ecstasy. Boston Statesman, May 22, 1827 TO SARAH The bird of land when far at sea Looks wishful toward the shore; The skiff, its oars pulls fearfully When night the sky is o'er. The wanderer in a distant clime, Will think oft of his cot, Remembering where the matin chime Pealed out, âForget me not.â The last lone one whom madness binds, Within its burning chain, Sometimes will feel sweet reason winds Blow o'er its scorched plain. The flower, the sun, the garnished skies Their seasons ever keepâ Thus my relentless destinies Have doomed me still to weep. For thou and bliss are still away, And clouds make life a nightâ There comes no hope with its pale ray To give me thee and light. Dearest! when comes the stilly eve When stars are quivering high Let fancy this dear vision weave That thine own love is nigh. Let the soft breeze as it sweeps on, Reveal this truth to thee; That, though thou art awhile alone, Alone thou canst not beâ For the heart that feels, and the tear that steals, Though now in distance hiddenâ In the twilight hour, in love's own bower, Are with thee though unbidden. Then blame not him whom fate has riven From thee a passing while, But weep that he has lost a heaven When absent from thy smile. Boston Statesman, June 2, 1827 JOB III, 19 âThe small and great are there, and the servant is free from his master.â Drear place of dreamless solitude! to thee Earth's generations pass. The small, the great, The mighty monarch, and the meanest slave Unceremonious mix their equal dust Within thy gloom-wrapt mansions. One has known The world's high honorsâservitude and pain Have been the other's lot; but in the grave,â Stern leveller of mortal dignity,â They now are equals. Ye that seek for fame, To shed its halo round your last abode! The grave hath hearts, which oft as yours hath swelled At fulsome adulationâat the applause Of wondering thousands; these forgotten lie, Oblivioned in the labyrinth of years, Which envious time hath on their memory heaped. So shall it be with youâawhile may fame, Faint and in whispers round your place of rest Tell of departed greatnessâtime at length Shall silence that small voiceâat length shall bring The monument, that ostentatiously Rears its tall head, emblazoned with the name And deeds of him, who 'neath its base returneth Unto original dust, as low as is That wasted form, and shall amalgamate Its crumbling ruins with the dust it honoured. Haverhill Gazette, June 2, 1827 FRIENDSHIP âWhat is friendship but a name?â 'Tis but a nameâa poet's dream, A shadowy form to fancy nigh, But faithless as the meteor's gleam, Flung o'er a dark and scowling sky. Yet, Friendship! there is in thy name A mystic charmâour dreams of thee Are all too bright, too pure to claim A kindred with reality. Alas, for life! it ne'er can know So much of pure and heavenly bliss, And Friendship's high and sacred glow, Must fade before man's selfishness! A word can burst the strongest tie That friendship twines around her heart, One haughty look, one cold reply, Can bid its brightest dreams depart. Stanzas 1 and 7 Haverhill Gazette, June 9, 1827 THE SEAMAN'S FUNERAL 'Twas midnightâand the waters slept Beneath the light the pale moon gave, And wreathless was the mist that wrapt The tranquil bosom of the wave. The ocean wind was chainedâits breath Scarce moved the pennon's drooping fold, All seemed to suit the scene of death That bowed the spirits of the bold. They raised the form of him they loved, To bear it to its lowly home; Each generous seaman's heart was moved, Each aspect wore the shade of gloom, As slowly down the vessel's side, They lowered the life-deserted clay, To meet the chill and noiseless tide, That opened to receive its prey. And there is naught to mark his grave; The moonlight falls as sweetly thereâ As lightly rolls the sparkling wave, As gayly melts the mist in air, As if no funeral's dull array Had e'er disturbed its solitudeâ As if no mortal relics lay Beneath the cold, unconscious flood. Yet calm he rests, as those who sleep Beneath the green earth's flowery sod, Although his mansion, chill and deep, Shall ne'er by weeping friends be trod. And though no stone with sculptured line, His name, his birth, his fortune tells, Pure at affection's living shrine, The memory of the seaman dwells. Stanzas 1, 2, 6, 7 Haverhill Gazette, June 16, 1827 LINES Written after reading âThe Warrior's Songâ published in the Memorial of 1827 Grasp! warrior, grasp the baleful steel, Thy banner to the sunlight fling, Haste! let thy charger's iron heel, On mail-clad bosoms ring; When blood-red fields are lost and won, Shall dreadless spirits stay? Go! beauty's hand shall wave thee on, And point thy daring way. And what though glory's sunlight fall, When thou are gone, upon thy name, Can death's impervious prison wall Re-echo to the voice of fame? Can stately tread of warlike men, Or peal of funeral gunâ Give rapture to thy spirit, when Its earthly power is done? Or can thy slumbers be like those, Which mild and peaceful spirits have? When, 'neath the monument that throws Its shadow o'er a nation's grave; Thy form is laidânot so, thy guilt Shall bid death's calmness flyâ The blood thy reckless blade has spilt, Shall send from earth its cry. Stanzas 1, 6, 7 Haverhill Gazette, June 23, 1827 THE RUIN Dark relic of an age gone by! Whose mossy towers and columns grey, Reared up against the evening sky, Seem mighty even in decay! The moon looks on the ragged walls, But lights no warrior's glancing crest, There's night and silence in those halls, Where gauntlet hand and mailed breast Flashed back the torches' midnight glow; Where minstrel honors well were sought, Where warriors at the red wine's flow, Their dangers and their toils forgot. Helming a rock which looks in scorn O'er ocean's darkly heaving flood, Thy beauty, not thy grandeur gone, Thou standest in thy solitude The representative of years Long sunk in time's oblivious tideâ How solemn, at this hour, appears Thy wreck of loftiness and pride! Thy lords of high renown have passed With all their power and wealth away, And darkly now thy ruins cast Their shadows where the mighty lay; Beneath whose proud and mighty tread Thy stony floors have ceased to ring Thy beacon tower has ceased to shed A lustre o'er their marshalling Of fearless bands. The hand of death Hath chained their eagle spirits down, And glory has not left a wreath, The memory of the dead to crown. Dark-dealing men! 'twas theirs to wield Oppressions unrelenting brand, The power was theirs, their hearts were steeled, And vainly groaned an injured land. And, crumbled ruinâcan I mourn To see thy splendor thus decayed? Or can I wish those days return Which saw thee guard a tyrant's head? Noâfor the peasant's lowly shed Has more endearing charms for me, Since there has peace her blessings spread, And there is truth and liberty. Haverhill Gazette, July 7, 1827 THE CONVENT Mansion of solitude and gloom! Dark prison of the soul! The living's cold and sunless tomb, Where bigotry's control Binds down the heart and chills its powers Of gratitude and love, And where life's dull and dreary hours In sullen sameness move. I feel no reverence while I gaze Upon its hoary walls: What, though they speak of other daysâ There issue from thy halls E'en now, a sad, a mournful toneâ 'Tis stealing on the air; The wasting sigh, th' unheeded moan, Are wildly mingling there. Oh! man, a spirit to shed A happy influence round, To hope, to love, to virtue dead, These dark abodes have bound. To be denied the interchange Of pure affection's spell, To find all objects cold and strange, To bid e'en hope farewell. To render life (which is at best A sorrowful sojourn) A vale where nought but shadows rest, And where the eye can turn On nought but objects veiled in night, And horrible as those Unearthly visions of affright, Salvator's scenery shows! Can this be faith? must all that soothes Life's stern and rugged way, All that delights and all that soothes Our transitory day, Give place to darkness and despair, To chilling hopelessness? Ah, surely no!âTrue faith should wear A brighter garb than thisâ The flowery plain, the glorious sky, The stream that wanders free, The snow-browed mountain, rude and high, The wild and trackless sea, Each hath a holier, purer shrine, To hearts of feeling givenâ Each breathes an influence all divine, A tone that speaks of Heaven. Deeply the organ's notes may roll, These stately halls among, The solemn cowl, and sable stole, May sweep in pride along. The lifted cross, the taper dim, The clouds of incense shed, The altar round,âthe funeral hymn, Low chanted o'er the dead, May all be here,âBut what are they Compared to nature's shrine? The empty formsâthe vain array, The ostentatious sign, Are mockeries all; but those who meet In thankfulness and love, With earth's green verdure 'neath their feet, The tranquil heaven above Where for the organ's lofty swell, The sounding breeze is given, Such, such have felt that earth could tell, Of purity and heaven. Haverhill Gazette, July 14, 1827 LIFE'S PLEASURES (Preceded by the editorial note given below) The following lines are from the pen of geniusâfrom a young man who has given many decided proofs in the Haverhill paper of a talent that only needs the trimming hand of care to make it shine one of the brightest lights in our poetical firmament. The writings of Bernard Barton have shown that a Quaker's plainness and simplicity are not inconsistent with âthoughts that breathe and words that burn,â and we hope to see from this writer another confirmation of this truth. Indeed a decidedly good poetical talent is so rare, that we hail it under any auspices, with the full conviction that it belongs to the community to encourage and assist its progress. We urge our correspondent to continue the good work, always remembering that toil and skill are almost synonyms; and assuring him that we shall rejoice to receive his contributions. Life hath its hour of joyâthere falls, No gloom on childhood's sunny brow, No care that bowsâno bond that thralls The heart, can life's gay morning know. But oh! for childhood's sunny hours In vain the heart in after years Shall seekâwhen withered by the blight Of disappointmentâwhen the cares Of life are crowding on the mind, When by fate's faithless phantom led In search of joy, it mourns to find The promised bliss forever fled. Life hath its hour of golden dreams, Of confidence and vows of truthâ When fancy with his brightest beams Has lighted up the path of youth; But soon or late a time must come When dreams of youth must pass away, And sorrow cast its veil of gloom Before its bright and cheering ray; The noblest feelings of the heart, Of pure and deep affection born From the chilled bosom shall depart, Withered by cold neglect and scorn. Life hath its hour of Loveâit brings A strange compound of hopes and fears;â Brightest of Life's imaginings Is Love in youth's unclouded years; But oh! how oft its charm hath passed Like visions of the night away, Swept o'er by disappointment's blast Leaving the heart in dread decay;â The fondest and the loveliest form That e'er hath known love's rapturous spell Has sunk beneath the wasting storm That on its true affections fell. Life hath its blissâthe bliss that flows From consciousness of having done Our duty, at life's weary close, When slowly sinks existence' sun; When we can look around and see No dark accusing spirit near, When from the bond of earth set free The weary soul hath joy to hear Its summons to a brighter clime, Where earthly woes no entrance find, And when the dreary hours of time Are left with all their cares behind. Boston Statesman, July 21, 1827 NIGHT âHath mortal eyes these glories seen, Yet turned to such a world as ours.â De Leon's âNoche Serenaâ Blest lights of Heavenâcelestial gems Of pure and fadeless glow, Beaming like golden diadems On evening's dusky brow! There is a soul-enchanting spell, A power in each mild ray Ye shed abroad o'er night, to quell The stormy cares of day. I've seen the glorious morning burst The dim array of night. I've seen the sunlight when it first Glanced over tower and height, I've seen a flood of glory flung By sunset o'er the sky, When every cloud in air that hung, Received the gorgeous dye. But thou, O dim and moonless night! I love thee more than all Of morning's earth-rejoicing light, Or evening's glorious fall! Inspired by thee, I drain the cup Of wild imaginings, I love thee, for thou bearest up My mind from earthly things. There is no sound on hill or heath The forest hath no toneâ And silent flows the stream beneath The dark oaks that have grown Above its banksâthere is a deep, Fixed quietness around 'Tis nature's hour of calm and sleep And O! it is profound. Let others seek the gay sunshine, The pomp and glare of day; The tranquil hours of night be mine, For then can fancy stray Unchecked by aught of earthly things And inspiration's glow Can lend my mind mysterious wings To fly from every wo. O starry host! bright page thou'rt writ By an Almighty hand Glory like thine alone is fit To speak of God's command. Roll on! roll on! ye stars of night, 'Till doubting mortals own That in your paths of stainless light Eternal power is shown. Stanzas 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 Haverhill Gazette, July 21, 1827 [Yes! brightly does the sunlight fall] The Indians supposed the White Mountains to be the residence of supernatural beings, and therefore never ventured to ascend them. This curious tradition is preserved in Josselyn's New England. Yes! brightly does the sunlight fall On yonder mountain's naked browâ Its splintered peaks and columns tall, Are touched with morning's earliest glow. There's music in the leafy shroud That wraps in green its giant form, There's rainbow glories in the cloud That wreaths around its summit proud, Dim relic of the recent storm. Far down the cliffs, by tempest riven, The chainless mountain streams are rolled, Freed from the gloom which night had given, Their flashing waves are touched with gold. My sonâI see thine eagle eye Is fixed upon the gorgeous sceneâ I see thou hast aspirings high, To climb yon pillars of the sky, Where mortal foot hath never been. But go thou notâthy pathway there, Is fraught with dark and nameless ills; The dreadless spirits of the air The demons of the clouded hills There hold communion. When in wrath, The tempest stoops o'er yon grey peaks, Their dark forms shade the lightning's path, And mid the whirlwind blast of death, Is heard their wild, unearthly shrieks. O! I could tell to thee a tale, My gallant sires have often told, When bending downwards to the vale, The clouds of coming tempest rolled From those veiled heights. 'Twas of a young And dauntless chief, who ne'er had turned From where the sound of conflict rung Where knives were drawn, and bows were strong, His fiery soul with rapture burned. It was a glorious hour like thisâ The sun had flung his veil aside, And lightened with his mounting kiss The hoary mountain's brows of pride The chieftain saw the night shades roll From off the crags and melt away, And then a mighty purpose stole Upon his proud, unconquered soul, And none his stern resolve could stay. âI'll seek,â he cried, âthat frowning steep, I'll meet the demons of the airâ Let coward souls from danger keep, 'Tis mine to snatch new triumphs there!â The ancients of our tribe were near, They sought to check his youthful prideâ They hold him many a tale of fear, Of spectral hand and shadowy spear, Seen dimly on the mountain's side. He scorned them allâhe grasped his spear As one whose purpose none might stayâ He called his brethren, slaves to fear, And proudly took his daring way, Up the dark heights, whose forest veiled His form from many an anxious eye. Three times the light of morning hailed Those rugged peaks by man unscaled, And thrice the sunset streaked the sky. Then when the light of day had passed, Clouds gathered on the mountain's browâ Deep thunders rolled, and fierce and fast The lightning flung its lurid glow, Breaking the mountain's solitude Was heard full many a fearful cryâ And spectral forms in darkness stood Above the rushing mountain flood, And waved their shadowy arms on high. The storm retiredâthe sunlight fell In beauty on the hills again, Where not a trace was left to tell Of desolation's midnight reign. But heâthe youthful chieftain came To view his anxious friends no moreâ And oh! a blight passed o'er his fame, And none dared whisper of the name They hailed so joyously before. His was an effort all too stern, Too fraught with ills for man to tryâ And hence, my son, I bade thee turn From yon grey peaks thy kindling eye. When music from their woods is heard, When light clouds o'er their summits come, Think on the fate of him who dared The voice of age to disregard, And seek thou not the spirits' home. Haverhill Gazette, July 28, 1827 TO THE SUN I love thee in thy dying hour, For then thou speak'st of death to me; And when thou light'st the coral bower Which rises 'neath the waveless sea, I love thee more, for thou dost thine On things like this poor heart of mine. I love thee, Sunâwhen thou dost come, Fresh from thy sleep, to chase the mist Which hovered like a fearful gnome, On mountain tops thy beams have kissed. For then thy glow is on the grave Of her I lovedâwhere wild flowers wave. Shine onâand may thy glory pour Its tide full soon upon the place Which marks that my career is o'er, With all its woeâits bitternessâ And then, sweet Ellen, I shall be Above yon stars, at peace with thee. I love thee, Sun,âthy daily course Assists the flagging wings of Time; Thou wast of him the cause, the source, To cheer his way through every clime. Oh Sun! thou canst not cheer my gloom, Unless thy ray rests on my tomb. Boston Statesman, August 4, 1827 HALCYON DAYS Were there no halcyon days? oh yes, There were in hours gone by, When cherubs of pure happiness Came laughing up the sky Like Naiads from the deep, deep sea, They came in loveliness to me. Oh youthâthy perfumed waving plumes, Are torn by life's rude blast; And when they've beat on earth's cold tomb Their beauty all has passed;â The smile which once was in thine eye Becomes thy tear, adversity. But yet, sweet memory, thy store Preserves infantile hours, And throws a sacred incense o'er Their lonely withered bowers. Still I can sing to halcyon days, E'en now, one little air of praise. My mother! and that witching eve When God and nature smiled, When thou, my long-lost Genevive, Warbled that song so wild! Ayeâthey will come and prove to me The world was not all misery. Those days when 'neath the forest oak, I dreamed ambition's dream, Whispered this heart could not be broke, While Hope held out one beam;â Oh it is sweet to be deceived, E'en in the hour when most bereaved. But, halcyon days, I envy ye, That once did visit me; Gone is your joyous revelry, Beyond life's bitter sea; But as the prophet did of old, I grasp your parting mantle's fold. New youth will come in other spheres, And then again we'll meet; Forgotten when these bitter tears,â This world's unkind deceit: And we will shout with gladness there Where comes not ill or black despair. Like friends whom Fortune's arm hath driven Apart to distant lands, We'll meet beneath a milder heaven, In pristine Friendship's bands,â And there mid those resplendent rays We'll sing together, Halcyon days. Boston Statesman, August 4, 1827 POEM I could not weepâI could not weepâ The fount had ceased to flow. Then came that dull, that stilly sleep, The dead alone can know,â I felt like those whose stiff repose Rests 'neath the weight of Alpine snows. The Asphaltitian lake is rife With Death's own offeringsâ I would that this poor unblessed life Were like those painless things. But agony and I are living Both unforgiven and unforgiving. Tomorrow's sun comes from the sea On joyous hearts,ânot mine, Ambition weaves her witchery, But not my brows to twine. The sun has no enlivening ray That wreath long since has passed away. Lonely as rocks by ocean lashed Come life's rude waves to me, Rudely as ships on coral dashed, Strikes worldly courtesy. Yet the calm shall come when not a breath Shall enter the house of withering death. Yet winter has its bonny spring, And why not one for me? It comes, it comes in blossoming, Sweet Helen, from thine eye. Aye, we will laugh at Death awhile, For life and hope are in thy smile. Boston Statesman, August 11, 1827 A CALM AT SEA I would not rest so still on those dark waters, Where yonder bark upheaves her milky sail, Like a white crag from out the glassy deep; For it would seem as if the pulse of mind, Had stopped its course, and man by Fate was fixed, A living dead one, who to think or feel, Must ever think or feel the same dull thoughts; A monument undying of dead life. And yet those are who thus do gaze on things, Until the tide of Time will bear them off And then, poor leaden souls, they slowly sink And the blue waters cover them. A ship at rest! An image of despair. Around it silence, yet within its hulk, A consciousness of illâof fettered restlessness; Bound like a victim at the stake to die, Who bears the torment, yet seems not to feel. And thus it is with man whose frame is chained To this poor earth, by the frail bonds of life, When Hope points out another better sphere, Where are forgotten all the pains of this. He waits, a ship at rest, for some blest breeze, To waft him onward to the port of heaven. Boston Statesman, August 11, 1827 TO âROYâ (N. P. Willis) On reading âMisanthropic Hours, No. 2â Yes! I have dwelt upon thy lays With glowing heartâmy humble praise Unsparingly to thee was given; For I believed that thou wast one, The muse's pure and sunlit heaven, With cloudless splendor shone upon. And little did I deem the lyre Which could so feelingly portray The anguish of the royal sire, And conquering Jephthah's deep dismayâ The lyre that brought that bitter hour, When Jesus in the garden knelt, Before me with a strength and power To make my stubborn feelings melt, So soon would leave its lofty toneâ The spell of powerâthe winning lay, And voice of charity disownâ Feelings, which I am proud to say Are mineâIn truth I ne'er have known That âhollow painted pageantryâ Such as thy scornful lays have shown Creation's fairest work to be, The âglowing lip,â the âicy heart,â The âheaven and earth together flung,â The levity which hath no part With nobler feelings, and the tongue Of trifling converse. These may be Perhaps with truth to some applied. But, should one form of vanity Give thee occasion to deride That sex, without whose softening charms, Man's gloomy soul were desolateâ That sex, whose tenderness disarms The woes that on life's journey wait. I've seen the form of woman bend When man's would not. I've seen her eye Uplifted as she knelt to send Her pure and stainless thoughts on high. I've seen her bending o'er the bed, With troubled brow and glistening eye Where sickness bowed the sufferer's head, And quenched the strong man's energy. I've seen her hand of kindness deal Raiment and food to mourners, whom Man's scorn and pride had made to feel The anguish of the wanderer's doom, I've seen her to the starry skyâ The wooded cliff and torrent fall, In rapture raise her kindling eye, And grateful bless the God of all. Hast thou forgotten her who smoothed The pillow of thy infancy? The voice that erst thy slumbers soothedâ Is not that shrined in memory? Was not a mother's holy love Around thee in thy childish mirth? And did it not appear above The low and sensual things of earth? And canst thou then despise and spurn The sympathies of woman's heart, And, with a scornful spirit, turn From visions, that may well impart A rapture to life's hours of care, And prove the balm of many a woe? If such thy purpose, go, and wear Contempt and hatred on thy browâ Pass on, a stern and lonely one, And for their âearthliness of thoughtâ The tempting forms of beauty shun, And burst their spell, ere fully wrought. But fare thee well!âthe time may come, When, that thou scornest now, may be The only ray amid the gloom That shades thy wayward destiny. Yes, woman's love may be the stay When every other tie has partedâ The cheerer of thy lonely way, When man hath proved but faithless hearted. Haverhill Gazette, August 11, 1827 THE JERSEY PRISON SHIP They diedâthe youngâthe loved, the brave, The death barge came for them, And where the seas yon crag rocks lave Their nightly requiem, They buried them all, and threw the sand Unhallowedly o'er that patriot band. The black ship like a demon sate Upon the prowling deep; From her came fearful sounds of hate, 'Till pain stilled all in sleepâ It was the sleep that victims take, Tied, tortured, dying, at the stake. Yet some the deep has now updug, Their bones are in the sun; And whether by sword or deadly drug, They diedâyesâone by one. Was it not strange to mortal eye, To see them all so strangely die? No death upon the field was theirs, No war-peal o'er their graves. They who were born as Freedom's heirs, Were stabbed like traitor slaves. Their patriot hearts were doomed to feel Dishonorâwith the victor's steel. There comes upon the stilly eve, Wild songs from that wild shore; And then the surges more wildly heave Their hoarse and growling roar. When dead men sing unearthly glees, And shout in laughing revelries. The corpse-light shines, like some pale star, From out the dead men's cliff; And the sea nymphs sail in their coral car, With those that are cold and stiff. And they sail near the spot of treachery, where The tide has left that dark ship bare. Are they those ancient ones, who died For freedom and for me? They areâthey point in martyred pride, To that spot upon the sea, From whence came once the dying yell From out that wreckâthat prisoned hell. Hark! hear their chantâit starts the hair, It makes the blood turn cold; 'Twould make the tiger forsake his lair, The miser leave his gold, And see yon harper! he doth try A dead man's note of melody. Chant Soundly sleep we in the day, And yet we trip it nightly, We sail with the nymphs around each bay, When the moon peers out most brightly, And we chase our foes to their distant graves, For they, like us, are sleeping; But they dare not come o'er our bonny waves, For our nightly watch we're keeping. Our spectres visit their foreign homes, And pluck right merrily, Their bones which whiten within their tombs, And plant them here, aye, cheerily,â For cheerily then we dance and sing, With our spectre band around them, And the curse and the laugh of scorn we fling, As we tell where our shadows found them. And then we go to the rotting wreck, Where we drank the cup of poison, We laugh and we quaff upon her deck, Till morn comes up the horizon. But skip ye, skip ye, beneath the cliff, For the sun comes up like a fiery skiff, Ploughing the waves of yon blue skyâ Hieâlaughing spectres, to your homes, hasteâhie.â Boston Spectator, August 18, 1827 THE BURIAL OF THE WARRIOR 'Tis overâthey have laid him down, The warriorâto his dreamless rest, The last turf by his comrades thrown, Is gathered o'er his princely breast; They may not view his form again, For their last look was taken when, They found him on the battle plain, Among his slaughtered men. The wakeless slumbers of the dead, Hath chilled the warrior's form, and now, With tearless eyes, his comrades tread The trembling earth that hides his brow. Darkly and gloomily they stand, Above their chieftain's cold abode; They mourn the proudest of their band, But not a tear hath flowed. Oh! how unlike the friends that crowd Where sleep the truly virtuous dead! Oh! how unlike the mourners bowed Around affliction's hallowed bed! As lingers in the glowing west, Of living light, a glorious flood So lives within affection's breast, The memory of the good. But 'tis not sleepâthat dread repose Which gathers round the warrior dead, For 'tis not like the sleep of those Where peace and piety has led, For round his grave in midnight hours, The victims of his strife shall come, And love shall twine no wreath of flowers Around his haunted tomb. Stanzas 1, 5, 6, 7 Haverhill Gazette, September 15, 1827 SONG Air, âLoch Doineâ Ye say, ye dinna love me nowâ 'Tis weel; but ye maun gie to me The gowden ring ye're finger wears; I winna waste sic things on yeâ An' tak' those ear-rings frae ye're ears, Ye ken they cost me muckle gowd; An' tak' that chain frae off ye're neck, For it has made ye a' too proudâ An' I'd nae gie a pint o' wine To hae ye say ye wad be mine. I ken there's mair in this wide world, An' trust me, I'll nae greet for ane; I'll further gae, an' better fare, An' ye, proud lass, maun live alane! Then gie me back my ring again; I winna waste its worth on yeâ My jewels breetâmy gowden chainâ The de'il may hae ye then for me; For I'd nae gie a pint o' wine To hae ye say ye wad be mine. Haverhill Gazette, September 22, 1827. SONG Gae an' leave meâlet nae sadness Shade that bonnie e'e o' thine, Gae! an' be thy spirit's gladness, Lasting as the wae's o' mine. Gae! an' let oblivion cover A' that thou hast kenn'd o' me. Gae a fause deceitful lover, Yet my prayers shall gae wi' thee. Gae an' leave meâfame may call thee, Glory on thy path may wait, Love o' silken ties enthrall theeâ Ties as strong as those o' fate. Brighter e'en an' smiles may greet thee, Fairer han's may press thine ain, But when vows o' fondness meet thee, Think how true my ain' hae been. Fare thee well! I'll ne'er detain thee, Gae! thy bark hath spread her sail, Ties o' love hae fail'd to chain thee, An' can tears o' mine avail? Gae! fause lover, gae, possessing, A' that made thee dear to me, An' may heaven's ilka blessing, Joy an' sunshine bide wi' thee. Haverhill Gazette, September 29, 1827 THE PAWNEE BRAVE (A young chief of the Pawnee Indians obtained the title of Brave, from the circumstances related in the following lines.) Grimly toward the clouded skies, Gleamed the fire of sacrifice, On the mist-encumbered air, Widely flashed the baleful glare; Swiftly down its rugged bed, Rolled the torrent darkly red; River course and forest way, Traced in that unhallowed rayâ Clothed in its unearthly hue, Dimly opened on the view. Hemmed within the blazing wood, Sheâthe helpless victim stoodâ Sheâthe loveliest of her race, Doomed that funeral pile to grace. Where was then her father's arm, Lifted but for mortal harm? Where his voice to summon then, Crowded ranks of dusky men? They were farâand hope had fled, And her thoughts were with the deadâ Vain to look for mercy's eye, In the dark forms hurrying byâ They have heard their leader's breath, Chant the stirring hymn of deathâ They have wept above the slain, On the reeking battle plain, O'er each dark and silent brow They have poured the vengeful vow; Will they from their purpose stay? Will the dance of death delay? Sooner from its destined bourne, Shall the mountain torrent turn; Sooner shall the whirlwind's wrath, Pause in desolation's trackâ Sooner from its darkened path, Roll its stormy chariot back. See! the flames around her close, Smaller now the circle grows, Horrid laugh, and fiendish yell, Louder on the night air swell. Victim! thy last hour is come, Bow thee to thy certain doom; Be thy father's spirit near, Let it chase thy rising fearâ Let it triumph over pain, And thou shalt not fall in vain, If in such an hour and place, Thou canst teach the hated ones, That the daughter of thy race, Well may shame their proudest sons. Hark! a sound is on the breeze, Borne among the giant treesâ Not the bittern's sullen boom, Heard amid the forest's gloom, But the tramping of a steed, Reeking with his fiery speed! Fast he bears his rider onâ Who is heâthat daring one? Wrath is on his youthful brow, Flashes wild his dark eye nowâ Warriors linked in gloomy dance, Shrunk beneath his scorching glance, High and shrill his war-note rung, Towards the blazing pile he sprungâ Fast and fearlessly he broke, Thro' the mingled flame and smoke; Giant strength his arm possessed, Sundered fell the victim's chainâ Thro' the fiery ring he pressed, With his rescued charge again. In the might, a righteous cause, Round its bold asserter draws, Mid the dwellers of the wood, Proud and unconcerned he stood; She, whom he had snatched from harm, Leaning on his powerful arm, Not a hand was raised to deal On the twain the stroke of death, Not a warrior plucked his steel From its darkly crimsoned sheath; But the brows that would defy, Smoothed before his fearless eye. Vengeance and its dark array Passed like morning's cloud away; Nobler feelings mingled then In the breasts of those dark men; Round the youthful chief they came, Hailed him as a son of fame; Bade him as a friend depart Warrior of the fearless heart! And the twain have gone their way, But the maid he dared to save From that unforgotten day, Still hath blest the Pawnee Brave. Haverhill Gazette, September 29, 1827 ALLAN GRAEME Ken ye maidens, wha is he Wi' the mirk an' mournfu' bree, Wi' the wild, an' wanderin' e'e, That across the moorlan's cam'; Seems he not o' foreign mien, Far along our braes sae green, None sae sad are ever seen, Hush! he comes! 'tis Allan Graeme. âAllan Graemeâfrae whence art thou? Care hath dimm'd thy bonnie brow, Thou art pale an' mournfu' now! Allan speak! thy sorrows name.â Like the tree, the north win' gars, Shake sae wildly, when it blaws, Nightly o'er the wintry braes, Shook the form o' Allan Graeme. An' he answer'd wild an' fierce, âDinna read my aspect thus, Nane o' ye maun know the curse, Graven there in words of flame; Tak' ye're bonnie han's frae mine, See ye not the guilty sign? Bluid hath darken'd ilka line, I' the han' o' Allan Graeme.â âAllan Graemeâit canna be, Nane were ance mair kind than thee, Nane wad e'er hae thought to see, Ane sae noble bow'd wi' shame; Speak! relate thy wrangs to us, Wha has dar'd to use thee thus? Wha has dar'd to fix a curse On the head o' Allan Graeme?â âKen ye not the curse was giv'n, By an a' avengin' heaven, Haunted now, to phrensy driv'n, Maidens, I have left my hame; As ye shun the tremblin' scaur, When the torrent comes to war, Shun me, maidens! fly me far, Shun the path o' Allan Graeme.â Haverhill Gazette, October 6, 1827 THE MINSTREL Where is now his tuneful number? Who shall burst his harp's deep slumber? Is there none to pour along O'er its chords the melting song? Have the strains that told so oft How his spirit soared aloft, Faded, now his light is dim? Do they sleep in death with him? Know, beyond the reach of time, Brighter still in memory's clime, Where affection's seal was set, Shall the minstrel linger yet. Go, and make his grave beneath Where the ivy loves to wreath, O'er the elms that mark the spot, Where his muse the minstrel sought; 'Neath the turf he loved in life, Let him rest from mortal strife, Hang the harp he cherished so, On the green and waving bough, And the breeze, that steals along, There shall wake the hidden song, Oft when midnight cold and still, Slumbers on the misty hill, Shall the minstrel's form unseen, Glide along the noiseless green; Mournful, then, the harp shall sigh, While that form is passing by. Silent minstrel! peace to thee, Green thy resting place shall be; O'er the stone that marks thy grave, Shall the winding ivy wave, And affection's holy tear, Oft, at eve, shall glisten there, Though the harp no more shall thrill To the hand of mystic skill, Though the tones we loved to hear Shall no longer chain the ear; Still the memory of thy worth, Shall be kept alive on earth. Haverhill Gazette, October 6, 1827 TO THE AUTHOR OF THE âODE TO SATANâ I dinna ken how ye can tell Sae muckle o' the chief o' Hell Wha i' your sang ye hae sae well An' ably painted, Unless auld spunkie an' your sel Are weel acquainted. I dinna see how ye should ken, Sae muckle o' th' infernal den, Unless i' truth yoursel hae been E'e witness o' it; Ye maun hae been delighted then,â Ye reverend poet. For I maun say, that your idea, O' the auld imp is muckle queer; I ken ye maun hae gumption clear For likeness taken; When o'er your head his dusky spear, The fiend was shakin'. Did ye nae fear that he wad stick ye, And down amang his brimstane kick ye? Not saeâ, ye kenn'd he wadna trick ye When friendly to him; A downright gawkie wad auld Nick be To wark ye ruin. Aweelâye are a learned ane And reverend too ye are, an' nane Maun doubt the truth o' what has been Tauld them i' numbers, Sae fineâthat while we list your strain, A' reason slumbers.

But earthly kings, ye ken will hae Their flatterers near them, ane an' a', An' wha kens but auld Nick may ca' Ye also to him; Sae if i' truth ye wish to gae, Mair kindness do him. Haverhill Gazette, October 13, 1827 SONG Tell me nae mair o' what I hae, Though gowd be round me shinin', An' vassals at my biddin' gae, The heart is still repinin'. Can wealth, or power gi'e joy to ane, Whose hopes hae a' been blighted, Or splendor light the cauld hearthstane O' ane sae lang benighted? The light o' fame an' fortune glows Aroun' the broken-hearted, Like lamps aboon the tombs o' those, Wha hae frae earth departed. It canna frae their slumber start The frozen founts o' feelin',â Across the cauld an' wither'd heart, Like simmer sunshine stealin'. When a' the ties affection wove Around the heart, are broken, An' ilka dayâo' joy or love Blots out some cherish'd token; Then feeble comes the voice o' praise Upon the heart o' sadness An wealth can gi'e to evil days Nae cheerin' tint o' gladness. As cauldly rise the northern gleams, To make the night mair dreary, Sae wealth an' useless splendor beams Aroun' the worn an' weary. Then tell nae mair o' what I hae, Though gowd be round me shinin', An' vassals at my biddin' gae, The heart is still repinin'. Haverhill Gazette, October 30, 1827 TIME Dark dealing power! around thy way The wrecks of human grandeur lay; Oblivion's waters, cold and black, Roll onward in thy gloomy track, And darkly hide from mortal ken, The traces where thy course hath been. The proudest things that earth hath known, The gorgeous splendor of a throne, The crest, and kingly diademâ Thy peerless arm hath scattered them; And power that shook the world with dread, Lies crushed beneath thy mighty tread! Successive years around thee flow, Yet leave no traces round thy browâ Revealing and destroying all; As firmly now thy footsteps fall, As when at first thy course was given; And thy dread limits marked by Heaven. Mysterious power! still deep and strong Thy tide of years shall roll alongâ The sun shall leave his home on high, The moon and stars of heaven shall die; But thou shalt be the last to fallâ The conquerer and end of all! Haverhill Gazette, November 17, 1827 âTimeâ was reprinted in the Boston Statesman on January 19, 1828. Preceding, was the following editorial note. J. G. Whittier.âA youth of this name, whose early life, like that of the Bloomfield and the Hogg of the British Poesy was occupied in manual occupations, and whose untutored ear first caught the tones of inspiration in the many voices of Nature, and whose heart was awakened to the sweet breathings of the muse only by a contemplation of the glories of Creation,âhas recently emerged from his obscurity as an anonymous newspaper contributor, and announced his intention of publishing a volume of his effusions. He is a Quaker and has been nurtured in the straitness of his sect, and therefore it is the more surprising that his compositions should be replete as they are, with that peculiar fervor and animation and intensity of thought, which is supposed attainable only by an attentive study of the best models. âThey only who have been much among old books,â says some greybeard of literature, âcan carry with them into their own writings that firmness and solidity which are the true stamina of poetry.â If this remark be generally true, then is Mr. Whittier an exception to an acknowledged rule, as we think those of our readers will confess who peruse the following stanzas originally published in the Haverhill Gazette. LINES On the death of an infant Child of the brief but cloudless day! O! who can mourn e'en now, That time hath had no power to lay Its shadows on thy brow! Thou'rt beautiful in deathâno trace By care's dark pencil writ, E'er passed upon that quiet faceâ No crime hath darkened it; But free thou art, as at thy birth, From all the thousand stains of earth. Weep notâfor why should tears be shed That Heaven hath called him hence? The rugged path that man must tread, Life cannot recompense. And joyous now can memory bear The image of thy childâ Its loveliness embodied, there, Stainless and undefiled; Nor mourn the gift recalled to Heaven, As pure as when to thee 'twas given. Stanzas 1 and 5 Haverhill Gazette, December 8, 1827 TO THE MEMORY OF CHATTERTON Youth of the high and gifted lyre! Thy feeling heart and minstrel fire, Too keenly felt, too warmly glowed For life's uneven, cheerless road; Where storms could blight and frosts could chill The dawning hope and burning thrill. Too soon the beams of fancy shed Their wizard radiance on thy head; Too soon they led thy gaze along The wild and tempting path of song; And kindled in thy heart a fire That glimmered for its funeral pyre! Too soon the rousing dream of fame Upon thy youthful slumbers came; Too soon the rainbow gleams that fly Disordered round the poet's eye Led forth thy young unpractised foot To urge for them the vain pursuit. And ill a heart like thine could bear To see those hopes which promised fair, With all their glittering train decayâ The frost work of a fleeting day, And storm and darkness settle o'er The path they made so bright before. And oh! when fortune's stormy surge Had borne thee to destruction's verge, When wishing death and reckless how The conquerer dealt his final blow, Too lost to hope, too blind to fear, Thy hand itself assumed his spear! Did then no kindred spirit thrill To soothe thy heart and share its ill? Passed there no sympathethic glow Upon the shadow of thy woe? And did not friendship seek to bear Thy sinking mind above despair? Alas for thee! it was not soâ Unshared, unpitied came thy woe: The finer feelings thou couldst boast Were in the storms of fortune lost; And clouds whose tones were lent by Heaven Too soon, by misery swept, were riven. The cold and heartless bigot may Thy closing scene in gloom array, Thy name to hate and scorn consign, But who shall say what guilt was thine? The misery of thy life to scan And judge thy crime is not for man. Farewell! around thy grassy pall The tears of kindred hearts shall fall; The bard shall o'er thy tomb recline And feel his spirits blend with thine, And beauty's eye shall shed for thee Its tear of holy sympathy. Boston Statesman, January 19, 1828 LINES ON THE NEW YEAR 'Tis over nowâtime's wreck-strewn wave, Hath closed upon a year Its deep and unrefunding grave, Whence nought can reappear; And thou deep, solemn midnight bell, Art tolling now its funeral knell. High thrilling hopes, too fondly known, Have with that sound expired; And rainbow dreams of life have flown, That erst the bosom fired; Visions that hit the opening year Have fled and left but darkness here. Thou coming year, could I obtain The power to look on thee, Thy chequered pathâthy hours of painâ Thy gloom and doubt to see, I would not lift the veil that lies Upon thy hidden mysteries. No! by thy path in brightness drest, Or wrapt in cloud and storm, Beyond its power the eye can rest On hope's celestial form, High, pointing to a happier clime, Impervious to the storms of time! Then, coming year! I welcome thee, And all that thou may'st bring; Though few the joys that rest on me, From off thy passing wing. I will not murmur, while I know, Fate strikes no undeserved blow. Stanzas 1, 3, 8, 9, 10 Haverhill Gazette, January 19, 1828 THE DRUNKARD TO HIS BOTTLE Ye thievin' curse! I dinna care About ye're unco prisence mair, Since ye hae gi'en to ruin sair, Baith wealth an' credit; An' now to shun yere awsome snare, My vow I've made it. Nane ither than auld Hornie sent ye Before my path i' hopes to get me, An' wae's the hour I ever met ye, Ye cheild o' ruinâ E'en now despair an' portith wait me, By your ill-doin'. An' here's an end to midnight riotâ To reelin' gait, an' pulse unquiet; Their awsome cause I winna try it, Wi' frien' or foe; But e'en as frae auld Cootie, fly it, Where'er I go. Stanzas 1, 3, 6 Haverhill Gazette, January 19, 1828 THE SPIRIT OF THE WINDS âThou actor perfect in all tragic sound! Thou mighty poet e'en to phrenzy bold!â Coleridge Oh viewless spirit! well may'st thou Thy harp of power sweep lightly now, Since not a cloud thy breath has driven Along the calm and starry heaven;â And quiet moonshine, pale and chill Is slumbering now on heath and hill. Wild spirit of the chainless breeze! Thy course is on the trackless seas; Thou startest from their treacherous sleep The surges of the mighty deep; And bendest from thy clouded throne To smile on ruins all thine own. In peace or wrath thou visitest The desert's dark and sterile breast;â The mountain eagle's cold abode Where mortal foot hath never trod; And e'en the forest owns thy sway Whose oaks with age alone decay. Unrivalled minstrel! soft and low On Nature's harp thou breathest now; Faint steals thy music on the ear A sound which love itself might hearâ A melody, in mercy given To lift the lowly thought to Heaven. I love thy musicâharper wild! I've loved it from a very child Whether as now, its cadence stole Like angel whisperings on my soul; Or roused to murmurs wild and strong, The tempest bore its tones along. Thou'rt mightyâbut that might was lent Which wakes to sound thy element, The over-ruling power that rides The strong-winged hurricane, and guides The tempests on the chainless sea; That power, alone, commissioned thee. Boston Statesman, February 9, 1828 TO CASSIUS On reading his lines commencing âAnd what are we poets made of.â Forbear, forbear! ye graceless sinner! Why need ye gar the ladies winner? If poets like a hearty dinner E'en let 'em do it;â But though they're mortal men, it winna Be wise to show it. The warld believes we are a grade O' favored beings, finely made, But if 'tis proved we rhyme for bread Or needfu' gain, We poets then may ply our trade O' sang in vain. Ye speak o' us as if we were A' unco' fickle to the fair Sure mischief set ye to declare That half our trade is To flatter wi' the self-same prayer A score o' ladies. An' if we a' abjure the Muses, Will sentimental fair anes roose us, An' kindly seek to heal the bruises They gie our hearts? Alas! frae hence they'll a' refuse us, Spite o' our arts. Ye've played the muckle deevil, Cassiusâ A few mair rhymes like yours wad fash us; The reverend parsons a' wad lash us Till they were weary, An' ding us down frae steep Parnassus A' tapsalteerie. Then cease ye're blether, Cassiusâquat it, When ye in better mood gae at it, An' rhyme wi' truth, I'll nae combat it; For ye hae truly A sonsie muse, if ye'd nae let it Gang sae unruly. Boston Statesman, March 1, 1828 DEATH OF OSSIAN The moon, unseen by Ossian, shed Its light on Selma's halls; Silvering the armor of the dead That frowned along the walls, But all was cold and desolate No soul of song was there; And Morven's latest minstrel sate Wrapt in his dark despair Beneath the banners of the dead, That flapped above his drooping head. He sat within the crumbled porch, Unseeing and unseen; Where flashed of old the wassail torch, And princely forms had been. No more was heard the sound of shellsâ The harper's tale of fame: But there at dreary intervals The gusty night-breeze came, And caught the gloomy raven's cry, Hoarse mingling as it hurried by. He sat aloneâthere was not one Familiar voice or tread; The mighty of his race were gone, Their glory vanished! And nought was left to soothe and bless Of all his youth had known: Malvina's soul of tenderness And Evir-allen's toneâ The husband's joyâthe father's pride,â The voice of praise, were all denied. Tuneless beside the drooping bard, The harp of Selma lay, Its thrilling chords had not been stirred For many a weary day; For oh! that harp could wake no smile Where rapture once had glowed. The winds that wasted Selma's pile, Swept o'er the cold abode Of those who bent in gleaming mail To list its master's magic tale. Hoarsely and heavily the breeze Along the ruins passed, And Selma's old and gnarled trees Groaned deeply in the blast. It bore a sound to Ossian's ear Of mournfulness and dread; He raised his thin grey locks to hear The summons of the dead. For well he knew some hero's shade Was hovering o'er his sightless head. 'Twas Fingal's voiceâ'twas Tremnor's son! Renowned in many a lay, Him bending from his cloud of dun He called the bard away. âThy harp,â he said, âin Selma's hall, Has echoed long and well; A memory lingers round this wall, Of those who proudly fell; And every cliff that Morven rears, The record of the mighty bears. âAnd why should Ossian linger there Forgotten and alone? Come thou to Morven's mighty menâ The glorious who are gone.â âI come, my sire,â the minstrel said, âI feel that even now, The welcome hand of death is laid Upon my aged brow. And soon a minstrel's name shall be The only record left of me. âBut that shall liveâwith Fingal's name Shall Ossian still be known; Blest with the record of thy fame, The bard shall speak my own.â He ceasedâa low unearthly moan Rose sadly on the blast; Untouched, the harp sent forth its tone The soul of Ossian passed! By stranger hands his grave was made, And the grey cairn piled o'er his head. And peace be with thee bard of old! What though thy soul was high; And war's grim chart was darkly rolled Beneath thy frowning eye: Thine was a wild and stormy age, To Christian peace unknown; And dark as is thy deathless page, The master's power is shown In many a sketch to fancy dear; And many a tale that claims the tear. Boston Statesman, March 8, 1828 THE SURVIVOR There is a tradition among the natives of an island in the Pacific Ocean, that a crew of white men were thrown upon their shores, and that some of them lived to a great age.âI have endeavored to describe what I supposed to have been the feelings of the last survivor of those unfortunate men. W. I am the lastâI am the lastâ A lone, forgotten wanderer now: Yon tree that groans to every blast With bending trunk and leafless bough, Alone, where once a forest threw Its gorgeous colorings to the day, Surviving all that round it grew, Is but the type of my decay. I am the lastâI am the lastâ My kindred and my race are gone; These old and withered hands have cast The earth upon them one by one. I loved them allâand I have wept Full sadly at their memory's shrine; But years have passedâlong years, since crept A tear adown this cheek of mine. Ah! once I weptâmy heart was not So desolate, so seared as now; And tears would flow, till I had sought In vain for one familiar brow: All, all were goneâthe hunter stood Alone before me, dark and grim; My heart had not his savage mood, It had no fellowship with him. His gloomy spirit ne'er had known The linkings of affection's chain; He cursed my grief, he mocked my groan, Till madness rushed on heart and brain. I could not weepâI could not weepâ The fountain of my heart was dryâ 'Twas seared, when in his last long sleep I saw my latest comrade lie. I sat beside the sufferer's bed At dead of nightâthe torch was dim, And blended with the moonbeams shed A faint and ghostly light on him. I watched the pale and changeful glow Along his moveless features flit, And wiped the damps from off his brow, Where death his fearful seal had set. The grey morn brokeâand yet I gazed On the wan features of the dead: The morning passed, and noontide blazed Its searching radiance round my shedâ A weary dayâand yet I kept My watchings where the sleeper lay Till night with wing of darkness swept The lingering western light away. Ah! why should memory conjure up Those visions of departed things? A thousand times I've drained that cup Of wild and dark rememberings. That dreary night his bed I made Yon lone and blighted tree beneath; I smoothed the turf above his head And left him to the calm of death. My native land! my father's shore! Oh none to thee our fates shall tell, For memory wakens there no more Our last and sorrowful farewell. The hands we clasped in friendship true, The hearts that throbbed with ours, are still; And all who waved the long adieu Are silent in the grave they fill. Yes they are goneâbut tears were shed When the cold earth was o'er them pressed, And love and friendship softly tread Around their hallowed place of rest. But who, when nature's strife is passed, Shall watch beside my lonely bed; Shall close my beamless eyes, and cast Earth's mantle o'er my sleeping head? Father and God! I murmur not Against thy high and holy will; Though lonely, by the world forgot, Thine eye is on thy creature still; And though no earthly friend is nigh, When sinks the light that now is dim, Thy presence shall the void supply, And smooth the bed of death for him. Boston Statesman, March 15, 1828 THE MASSACRE OF ST. BARTHOLOMEW 'Tis nightâdeep night! nor sound nor tread, Proud Paris! breaks thy silence dead. A fixed reposeâa pulseless still, As deep, as ominous of ill, As that which chains the air and earth, Ere bursts the prisoned earthquake forth, Has settled round thy ancient walls, The holy fanes, and princely halls! Oh silent city! deadly harm Is lurking in that seeming calm; Morn streaks the east, and pours her light Along the ghastly face of night; Each sullen breath of morning air Is telling of the massacreâ The living's wailâthe dying's groan, And childhood's shriek, are faintly known. Exult, proud queen! those murmurs tell The issue of that deed of hell. Exult! thy fiendish task is wrought, And thou hast crushed the Huguenot! Haverhill Gazette, March 29, 1828 EDWARD AT CHARTRES While the King of England was encamped near Chartres in 1360, there rose a storm and hurricane, one of the most terrible on record. It was accompanied by hail of extraordinary size, and the peals of thunder were so loud and incessant that the boldest warriors trembled. Edward, notwithstanding his usual intrepidity, threw himself upon his knees and turning towards the steeple of Notre Dame at Chartres, implored the assistance of the Virgin, and made a vow upon the spot to grant peace to the French people. See Froissart, Chap. 211 He stoodâthe dreaded scourge of France At closing of the day Proudly, where banner, spear, and lance Gave back the sunset ray Surrounded by unconquered men, And filled with hopes of conquest then. Night gathered swiftly on the plain, Clouds blackened on the sky; The tempest wind threw off its chain, And swept in darkness by: And the long peals of thunder passed, Filling the pauses of the blast. Yet deeper fell the gloomy night, Yet louder rose the storm; And dancing with sepulchral light On spear and mailed form, The lurid gleams of lightning strayed O'er many a shrinking cavalcade. The monarch leaned upon his spear With troubled brow and eye, Watching each sound and sign of fear In that portentious sky;â E'en as he gazed that sky sent forth Its deadliest o'er the shuddering earth. It came with mingled fire and flood, Impetuous o'er the plain, The mighty pillars of the wood Bowed to the hurricane; And the tall warrior girt in mail Sunk down beneath the sweeping hail. Monarch! was this a time for thee, To triumph in thy might; To dream of coming victory, Or nerve thy arm to fight? Was this a time to look with pride, Upon the thousands at thy side? No! thou wast bending lowly then Thy knee upon the sod; And yielding with thy warrior men The altered heart to God: And the deep vow in anguish given, Was pouring on the winds of Heaven. 'Tis morningâbut the invader's lance Is laid in rest no more; The scourger of thy valleys, France, Is sweeping from the shore; And the last line of serried spears On ocean's winding verge appears. And ye that watch from dome and tower That pageant pass away Rejoice! for vain had been your power Its hostile march to stayâ Rejoice! but not as conquerers do, The victor's wreath is not for you. They passed unscathed by mortal harm The princelyâthe brave, Ere yet the trumpet's wild alarm One battle signal gave, That their deep vows in peril spoken For fame or power might not be broken. Boston Statesman, April 5, 1828 THE ENCHANTED LAKE Based on the story of a lake near Bergen, Norway, near which a sentinel was always posted to keep people from their desire to throw themselves in. (The poem opens with the picture of a maiden in distress. She questions the guardian regarding the fate of a young man who she believes may have met his death there. The guard answers in the affirmative.) Naught she spoke, but eye and brow Told that madness ruled her now, With a bound that mocked the arm, Vainly raised to snatch from harm, She hath reached the shivered steep, Bending o'er the gloomy deep. Phrensied joy was in her eyeâ Wild the cliffs gave back her cry. âLove! prepare a place for me, Quickly, for I come to thee!â Aged man! thy toil is vain. Yonder cliff thou canst not gain. Turn thee nowâthe deed is o'er, She hath sunk to rise no more. Weep not thou, of locks so grey, Though the lovely pass away, Dearer far than life to her, Was the watery sepulchre, Where the youth she loved so well, 'Neath its dark enchantment fell. Peace to them! and be their sleep Tranquil in that silent deepâ Waveless, tideless, tho' it be, Never swept by breezes free, Tho' no bird with sweeping wing, Shadow o'er its waters bring, Still shall be that silent lake, Sacred for the sleeper's sake. Stanzas 4, 5, 6 Haverhill Gazette, April 12, 1828 RALLE I have often admired the heroic conduct of Ralle, the Jesuit, in sacrificing himself for the safety of his followers. When inhumanly attacked by the English, instead of assembling his warriors, he conjured, nay commanded them to escapeâand advancing alone and unarmed to the side of a cross, which he had himself erected, he received the fire of the English. Morn stooped upon the hills; and the red sun Looked out upon the forest, through whose vast And trackless solitude, in silentness The calm Penobscot rolled its darkened tide To the embrace of ocean. Silence lay On the interminable wildâthe cliffs Grey and o'er hung with woods gave back no more The lengthy echoes of the hunter's gun. The clang of arms was hushedâthe white man's track Returning from the victory, might no more By the keen hunter's practiced eye be traced Along the forest openings. Nature's mood Was one of settled calmnessâbut the breast Of man was stormy, and his passions rose To open variance with the tranquil scene. And well might those who gathered sternly now Around their desolated dwellings feel A bitterness of spirit which the charm Nature revealeth in her tenderest hours May not subdueâfor that calm loveliness, Gentle and holy as its workings are, On the best feelings of a heart unroused By maddening impulses, has no power On the wrung spirit where the sense of wrong Deadly and deep is sternly gathering up Its desperate resources for the hour, When the long treasured purpose of revenge Should deeply be accomplished. In such mood The delicate and beautiful things of earth Rise on the view with tantalizing power, And the deep quietude of nature seemeth But mockery to the agitated heart. The sun passed up the heavensâthe hunters stood Beneath the deep oak shadows. They had laid The mangled body of their martyr down To his last sleep, even on the very spot Where he had taught them with unwearied zeal To bow devotion's knee, and offer up The aspirations of his guileless heart To the pure fount of blessedness; they smoothed The green turf o'er him, and beside his head They reared the holy symbol of the cross. The rites were all accomplished. They drew up Around the new-made graveâthe veteran brow Graven with battle, and the proud dark eye Of the wild forest maid. Sorrow was there With indignation blended, far too deep For utterance by wordsâbut the bent brow, Clothed in unusual darkness, and the eye Flashing with strange inquietude, revealed The purposing of vengeance. Oft the hand Of the stern hunter gathered in its grasp The ponderous battle axe; and the low hum Of many voices, strengthening as it passed Down the long lines of sullen warriors told That cliff and glen would shortly echo back The fearful cadence of their battle hymn. ... One warrior came Forth from the dusky multitude, and drew His tall form proudly up. The mark of years Was on his venerable brow; but yet His keen eye was undimmed; and though his form Was like the oak on which the storm has left A thousand tracesâyet like that proud tree, Unbending as in its primordinal strength So stood that ancient of the tribe. His arm Had been in many battlesâand his voice Had swelled the war cry on his native hills Through many a hard-fought day. Closer he drew His mantle folds about him; and inspired With nature's living eloquence, he spokeâ âBrothers! our hands have lain The valley-turf upon the sleeper's head, And the green foliage of the oak is spread Above the foully slain. â'Tis done! and now ye turn Impatient glances toward the white man's path, And for the dark and stormy work of death Your dreadless spirits burn. âBrothers, he foully died, That upright man and faithful! Who is here Warrior or maid, that he hath not dropped the tear O'er him who was our pride? âYet wherefore grasp the spear, And raise your chant so thrillingly on high? Can deeds of vengeance light the sleeper's eye, Or slaughter soothe his bier? âAlas! have ye forgot The holy counsels of the man we mourn, That ye would now in desperation spurn The lesson he hath taught? âWas his the arm to wave The sign of onset? Was his war-cry known, Where the deep vale of stormy fight had grown One dark promiscuous grave? âAh no: yet was his heart Unmatched for manly daringâye have seen In danger's hour, how nobly and serene He bore his trying part. âThen lift not o'er his sod The sign of vengeanceâraise no war-song thereâ But with the undoubting confidence of prayer, Resign your cause to God.â They felt the deep rebukeâthose dark men knew The spirit of the fallen had been breathed Upon their ancient chief; and casting down The implements of death, they bowed themselves Humbly in prayer around their leader's grave. Boston Statesman, April 19, 1828 THE WASTED FLOWER The storms of Heaven have borne thee down; The stem is brokeâthy leaves are strown In wild disorder o'er the plain Whence thou shall never lift again Thy head, to catch the evening dew, Or charm the lonely wanderer's view. Yet, wasted flower, thy sweet perfume Partakes not of thy fearful doom; It lingers still around the spot Where erst thy form the sunshine caught; And pours its incense on the air, When thou art desolate and bare. Thou art a type, thou lonely flower! Of virtue's deathâsurviving powerâ Fit emblem of the fragrance shed Around the truly virtuous deadâ The hallowed memory of the good, Which from the grave's cold solitude, Gives to the thought of parted worth, A charm unknown to things of earth. Boston Statesman, April 19, 1828 THE SYBIL'S CURSE Scorn notâmy curse is with thee nowâ A deep and deadly one 'Tis stamped upon the heart and brow, And may not be undone; 'Tis writ in characters of fire Upon thy guilty soul, And will, till life's last pulse expire, Thy destiny control. Go forth! go forth among the gay, And bow at pleasure's shrine; And beauty's fairest forms shall lay Their gentle hands in thine: But while thy heart is beating high, That curse shall o'er thee come; And e'en 'neath beauty's melting eye, Shall turn thy smile to gloom. Go forth! and let thy battle cry Awake the sleep of war; Go, lift thy sign of triumph highâ An evil-boding star. But not the robe of regal pride Or victor's crimson wreath Though proudly wonâshall ever hide The sleepless curse beneath. Go forth and seek forgetfulness, In revelry and wine:â Thou shalt forget all, all but thisâ This curse shall still be thine: 'Twill haunt thee in thy troubled sleep, 'Twill mingle with thy dreams, And still with thee unbidden keep When morning round thee beams. Where'er may thy steps impel That curse shall on thee rest; The horrors of a quenchless hell Shall linger in thy breast. Not hope itself shall deign to soothe The anguish of thy doom; It shall not lightâit shall not smooth The pathway to the tomb. Go nowâthe lingering curse is givenâ The spell is laid on thee The scorn of earthâthe wrath of Heaven Is in thy destiny. Go now, the spell is laid on thee Go, bear it to thy grave; For death alone can set thee freeâ And death thou dares't not brave. Boston Statesman, April 26, 1828 THE SWITZERS' SONG (This poem refers to the Revolution of 1308 when the Swiss, without bloodshed, were freed from the Austrians.) High let the song of triumph swell, O'er Lucerne's rock-girt sea, Till all the mountain echoes tell Of freedom's jubilee. Loud as, when first the strain arose On that remembered morn, When o'er St. Gothard's crest of snows, And clouded Jungfrau horn, The genius of our mountainland His star-lit banner, flung, And Freedom waved her signal brand, Where the trembling avalanche hung. The light of that auspicious dawn, No tide of slaughter dimmed, Instead of drum and gathering horn, The song of praise was hymned. No pennons red with battle bowed O'er guarded peak and glen, Our fathers' trust was in their God, Not in the strength of men. He heard their prayer, th' oppressor's pride, Was scattered in his wrath, Like snows upon the mountain side, Before the glacier's path. Then let the joyous harmony Of prayer and praise ascend, Until the mountain eagle's cry, With its wild music blend. Be this our prayer, that freedom shed Its light upon our land, And that the hills which now we tread, May unpolluted stand Long as the Lauffen's rocks shall bar The Rhine's impetuous tide, And thunder clouds shall move to war, Along St. Gothard's side. Haverhill Gazette, April 28, 1828 POEM It is an April mornâand rain Is beating on the darkened pane; The sleeping mist is on the hills, And angry floods have swelled the rills, Whose flow I loved so dearly when Their summer music filled the glenâ The trees that I have gazed upon When every bough that caught the sun Was full of beauty, and whose shade Fell coolly on the sunny glade, Now rear against the clouded sky Their bare proportions, dark and high, And none, while sadly gazing now On mossy trunk and naked bough, Would dream that summer suns could dress Such wasted forms in loveliness. I love the face of nature well, Its quiet beauty hath a spell, To waken joy in weary hours; Like dew upon the drooping flowers But in a dreary day like this When nature boasts no loveliness, When earth is mournfulâand in the sky The lazy clouds are rolling by; I feel that such a time is not Congenial with poetic thought, And that each effort e'er its close Would dwindle down to perfect prose. Away! away! I will not look On nature's dull and sombre book; Since here a fairy landscape brings The light of unforgotten things; The memory of those hours which wear The beauties of the changing year. And though the spring of lofty thought, From outward forms is vainly sought, This silent view of scenes, which can Yield gladness to the heart of man, To me hath something of the power, Revealed in nature's gentlest hour. The fading lightâthe sunset skyâ The broken clouds that float on highâ The winding streamâthe forest shade Along its gentle waters laid, All speak of natureâand that rude Old ruin hemmed with ancient wood, Across whose grey and ivied walls The latest gloom of evening falls, Restores the dream of old romance, The mailed knightâthe levelled lanceâ The tourney shoutâthe red wine's flowâ The minstrel's tale of joy or woeâ And all that once delighted me, In tales of âaunciente chivalrie.â Boston Statesman, May 10, 1828 SARDANAPALUS TO HIS COURTIERS Aye, point me to the battered helmâ The pennon soiled and worn, By monarchs of Assyria's realm, In prouder ages borne. Point out the spoilâthe glittering gemâ The jewelled crestâthe diadem, From knightly temples torn. 'Tis vainâto me those trophies show How pride can mock at human woe. Ye say my sires were glorious, when The falchion never slept; When o'er each field of slaughtered men A thousand mothers wept; When thoughts of conquest stifling all Of pity for a nation's fall, Their hardened legions swept Across the realms of humbled kings Like the destroying angel's wings. And hence their gloryâhence their fame A never-setting sun! So let it beâno meed I claim, For aught that I have doneâ I ask no temple's haunted gloom, No sculptured archâno blazoned tomb, When my career is run, I seek no reverenceâbe it shown To my stern ancestors alone. Enough for me if I can die With blessings on my headâ Enough for me if beauty's sigh Is whispered round my bed; And tears which grateful hearts bestow Upon the soothers of their woe Be there in silence shed. Such be my meedâI ask no more Of memory, when my course is o'er. Boston Statesman, May 17, 1828 RURAL EXCURSIONS (Suggested by an item in the Boston Statesman warning people against rural wanderings because of poison ivy etc.) Yes! doubtless 'tis very amusing To wander at dawn of day, And search the meadows, and tread the hills, As the grey mist rolls away. 'Tis pleasantâ'tis sentimental, To watch the glad streams run; And see how the forest tops receive The kiss of the rising sun. But ah! 'tis a dangerous businessâ This strolling in quest of flowers; For poison twines with the sweetest shrubs, And lurks in the greenest bowers. You may pluck the modest wildflower Where the dark-green ivy grows; You may stop to sever the violet's stem And the dogwood brush your nose. With your hands the size of a farmer's, And the color of dingy brass; And your eyes just open enough to see Your delicate phiz in the glass; Your cheeks puffed out like bladders, And your nose provokingly redâ You'll hate the ârural excursion,â Drink saffron, and go to bed. Oh horrible!âhorribleâhorrible! Fair florists, stick to your home, As you would avoid the saffron tea And the bath of New England rumâ I know it all by experience, And I warn ye, florists fair! If ye have a mind for strolling, Again I say, âBeware.â Haverhill Gazette, June 7, 1828 MIDNIGHT THOUGHTS It is the noon of nightâthe far off stars, Clear and undimmed, as when at first they gemmed The blue expanse of heaven, are looking down Serenely beautiful!âThe half-faced moon Hath poured her delicate light upon the tops Of the tall trees; and the hills' summits wear The mantle of her beauty.âPshaw! I'll see!â 'Tis not exactly soâThere is no moon And if there was, I should not see it shine On lofty trees, or sky-approaching hills, But rather on the old distillery, Blackened with smoke,âor directly in the distance, The roofs of Frinksborough might reflect its gleam,â I told somewhat of starsâbut really now, I see but six or eight, and even these Are winking drowsily, as if they needed Their sleep as well as I,âI half suspect I have been dreaming nowâbut never mind! We poets are strange animals, and have Undoubted right to deviate a little From the plain path that sober prose points out. Haverhill Gazette, August 9, 1828 TO ? I ask no look of fondness, No tender glance of thine, For they would but be wasted, on A spirit ruled as mine. My pulse may lose its quietness With the music of thy tone; My heart may wildly thrill with thoughts The cheek would blush to own. It may be thusâit may be thus For passion's fount is deep; And easy 'tis for such as thou To burst its seeming sleep, Yet fear thou not the turbulence, Of feelings wild and strong, Altho' they bear the ling'ring stain, Of unrequited wrong. No! beautiful and stainless Thy love hath ever beenâ A veiled and holy shrine to claim The worshipping of men!â Then let no look of tenderness Its earthly home betray; Nor give at passion's stirring call, Its priceless gem away. Stanzas 1, 2, 4 Haverhill Gazette, August 9, 1828 THE CAMBUSCAN MIRROR Unrivalled Mirror! in whose face Engraven deep with mystic pen, Our dim, and bounded glance might trace The hidden thoughts of other men! Well wert thou worthy to be sung By him who swept the lyre of old, And lasting beams of genius flung On temples else unknown and cold. It may not beâwe may not look Upon the spirit veiled within, Or read as from an open book Its passages of shame and sin,â Enough for us if we can turn An eye upon our own dark way; Correct each erring step, and learn Our duties from each fleeting day. Stanzas 1 and 3 Haverhill Gazette, September 6, 1828 AT THE GRAVE OF A VERY YOUNG LADY Weep not for them who go In life's young hours, To lay them down below The churchyard flowers; Thy tears, fond mourner fall Upon the peaceful grave of all, For which their own would flow: Weep not for them. Their years have passed away Like their own dreams; Or the last light of day On silent streams, For they had yet to know, That joy is but the veil of wo, Seem lovely as it may; Weep not for them. They die as flowers have died, Laid low at morn, When all their hues of pride Were proudly worn; Not left to feel at last, The death chill of the mighty blast, And wither side by side; Weep not for them. But weep for them who stay, When friends are gone, While years of dull decay Move darkly on, Like sentinels that keep Their lonely watch while others sleep The stormy night away; Oh, weep for them. Soft on our lost one's breast, The turf shall lie; And oh, thus to be blest, Who would not die! She slumbers not to wakeâ No step, no voice, no dream shall break The stillness of her rest; Weep not for her. New England Weekly Review October 20, 1828 THE GRAVE OF HOWARD Nay, pass thou not with careless tread, This simple mound and mossy stoneâ The sanctity which shrouds the dead Is here in deeper reverence known. A hallowed memory lingers hereâ The very air is blest around, For pious prayer and grateful tear Have made the spot as holy ground. Peace to the good man's memory!âhere A champion of the cross is lain! No earthly laurels grace his bierâ No gaudy show of pageant vain. No herald slave above him stood, To speak of power and lofty birth; When here, in Christian quietude, He gave his weary form to earth. Dark conquerer! wear thy robe of prideâ Exult thee in thy arm of power, And let the spoil of nations wide, Yield splendor to thy triumph hour! Give me the memory of the just, Its blessing and its grateful tear, Like that, which sanctifies the dust Of him, who slumbers sweetly here. Stanzas 1, 3, 4 Haverhill Gazette, November 29, 1828 STANZAS How wearily the night goes on! And yet how silently!âthe hours Have passed me slowly, one by one, Nor weighed to sleep the mind's high powers. I feel the leaden moments press Upon my eyelids, but they bring To the mind's weary wakefulness, No grateful spell of slumbering. I will not murmurâthere are things That lighten o'er my darkest hours; As pureâas bright as angel's wings Descending from celestial bowers, And tones of friendship murmur still Around me, and the voice of love Comes o'er my spirit, like the thrill Of music from the world above. The world is fair, and nature wears Her beauty undefiled with sin; They bring no portion of the cares Whose fountains are concealed within, And I will tread life's coming way, Nor murmur at its weariness, But cherish through each evil day, The memory of departed bliss. Stanzas 1, 6, 7 Haverhill Gazette, February 14, 1829 AMBITION ââThese are not a tithe Of all the votary of living fame Must silently endure.â Fairfield Aye, nerve thee for the strife of men, The trial cometh now, The seal of pride is on thy lips, Of manhood on thy brow. Thy golden dreams of childhoodâ Thy thoughts of tender hours! Outtwine them from thy spirit now, They mar its sterner powers. Onâon!âthe fire of souls is hid Within thy kindling eye, And the proud spirit-glance is raised Up freely upon high. Bear up against the trial The mocking and the shameâ Nor stoop the pinion back to earth That beareth on to fame. Cast off the blending sympathiesâ The tender bonds of lifeâ Nor cling to aught that bendeth to The coming on of strife. What have the frail and beautiful To do with things like thee? Away! and leave them all behind Thy heart must still be free. Nay, pause notâfalter not, but on! There is no turning back, Thy weary wings must still pursue Its bold and upward track. Onâswiftly on! thy meed shall be One high and haughty hour, One bitter draught of heartless praise, One grasp at fleeting power. Philadelphia Album, February 18, 1829 A DEATH SONG âThe head sachem of the Narragansetts would not accept his life when offered on the condition that he should make peace with the English. When he was informed that it was determined to put him to death he said, âI like it well. I shall die before my heart is softâ before I shall have spoken anything unworthy of myself.ââ Neal's Otter Bay Betray my land? Ay, when the eagle Cowers beneath a heron's beak; Ay, when the lion from the beagle Turns with a recreant cheek. Betray my home? and from your fire, Bear off a heart of fear? Yea, change a wounded tiger's ire To the milk blood of a deer. Go ask my fathersâthose whose bones Rest in a brave man's grave; Go ask their trophied mound of stones, The trees which o'er them wave. A traitor be? and lose that chase Which tempts beyond the grave? Become the nameless of my raceâ A cowardâwomanâslave? Go backârekindle now your flame, Each sinew let it sear, 'Tis not so scorching as that shame Which blasts the heart of fear. Shout, shout, ye deadâmy soul is free, I greet ye, fathers, now. Your crowns are greenâthey wait for meâ Will flourish on my brow! Farewell, ye woods,âfarewell, thou sky,â I hail the glorious dead; They greet me for my victory, And love the brave one's tread. This is my death-song,âlet it rest Deep in your hearts, my foes; I sleep fore'er among the blest, Where heroes' hearts repose. I wake,âthe arrow's fatal barb Is in my land anew; I wakeâput on the war-feast garbâ And shout the war-halloo!â 'Tis better far with fame to die, Than live and nameless, stoop To the proud taunt of infamy;â Hurra for my death war-whoop! The Yankee and Boston Literary Gazette February 19, 1829 TAKE BACK THE BOWL Take back the bowl! take back the bowl! Reserve it for polluted lipsâ I will not bow a tameless soul Beneath its dark and foul eclipse I know that life must henceforth be A weary and unblessed thing; That hope can lend no ray to me, Nor flowers along my pathway spring. Well, be it soâmy strife hath been Beyond the low and vulgar aimâ The deeds of base and heartless men Have never dimmed my honest name; And I am proudâaye, even now Amid the shades of deepening ill; The fearless treadâthe open browâ The bribeless hand are left me still. Take back the bowl!âI will not steal The hallowed memories of the past, They add no pangs to those I feel, Nor shadows on the future cast. Aye, take it back; let others bring Oblivion o'er the haunted soul; My memory is a blessed thingâ Away! Away! take back the bowl. Philadelphia Album, March 4, 1829 (From American Manufacturer) THE FIRE SHIP (Suggested by a passage in the first volume of Salathiel) It was a dream, and yet it seemed As our waking visions are, We were out upon a broad old sea, And a joyous crew we were, The moonlight slept on the reeling deck, And the breeze in the sails was fair. A cloud came up where the sky bent down For the kiss of the silver wave, And the stars were veiled, and the breeze was chained To its shadowy ocean cave, And the moon went out, and the sea grew calm With a slumber like the grave. Our ship stood still on its ocean way, There was neither breeze nor tide, And black as death the waters lay Around on either side; And the stalwart crew grew stern and still, For the boldest heart was tried. Anon we heard a rushing sound, Like a tempest's coming on, And up through the thick and murky air A sudden meteor shone. We gazed upon it and turned away, And againâbut it was not gone. Onâon it came like a living thing, And the storm-tried seamen shook, And the proudest eye grew dim with fear At the awful shape it took, Like a ship of flame to us it seemed And yet we could but look. A ship of flame, with its fierce red sail, And its mast of tapering fire, And a tall form stood on its blazing deck, Like a slave at his funeral pyre! Nearer and nearer came the ship, And the mast of flame rose higher. Nearer and nearer came the ship, With its fearful tenant there! The flame like a robe was round him thrown, And his blackened arm was bare; But his lip was curled, and his brow was bent With the sternness of despair. Onâon with the flame of mast and sail The spectre ship drew nigh; A strange heat burned on every cheek As its flaming keel went by! And we saw its fiend-like mariner, But he uttered forth no cry. He stood with his crown of living flame, Like a glory and a curseâ He looked like a stern and suffering one, Who could not dream of worseâ And he turned his fierce and blood-red eye Like a comet's orb on us. We shrunk from its strange, unearthly glare, And the spectre saw it thenâ He turned his face, and we saw the trace Where a mournful thought had been, For he knew that he might no more commune With the forms of living men. With blazing shroud through the murky cloud That veiled the sea so dim They passed awayâthey might not stay That spectre bark, and him, Who sternly stood in the wreathing flame, Like the fallen Cherubim. They passed awayâthe cloud rolled onâ The stars shone out aboveâ The moon looked down on the wave again, Like a quiet thing of love; And the breeze sang merrily through the sails, And the ship began to move. I woke from sleepâand yet it seems As our waking visions areâ My heart hath dreams of that spectre ship, And its mariner's calm despair, For the graving hand of memory leaves Its legible horror there. Haverhill Gazette, March 14, 1829 THE CHURCH-YARD It was a clear, calm night of June; On mound and wall and ivy wreath, Slept the pale radiance of the moon, Like beauty in the arms of death,â It was a blessed seasonâsuch As spirits choose for wandering forth, When, trembling to their viewless touch, The lyre of Heaven is heard on earth. The church-yard, with its solemn lines Of pale grey stonesâand crumbling wallâ Its dark-green mounds, like sacred shrines Where weeping love might yield its all, Bathed in the solemn moonshine now Seemed all unfit for earthly things, Save as a spot for man to bow His heart to old rememberings Of love that bloomed no more for him, Of severed hearts, and sundered faith, Of all that makes our morning dimâ The harvest and the spoil of death! There came a manâwith hurried tread He passed above the peaceful deadâ One long, stern glance around he flung, As if he feared that man should know The feelings of despair that wrung His spirit in its hour of wo. He knelt him by a mound of earth And clear the ghastly moonlight fell Along a brow that shadowed forth The anguish and the pride of Hell! Contrition, mighty as the wrong Came o'er his haunted mind at last, And phrensied feelings smothered long O'er heart and brain in lightning passed. Well might he mournâa fairer flower Ne'er bloomed to fend the spoiler's pride, To be the idol of an hour, Then flung, a worthless weed, aside. She died, as high souls always dieâ She asked no pity, no relief; But veiled from friendship's searching eye The secret of her early grief,â And thus she fadedâlife went out, As vanishes some gentle star, When morning's light is drawn about The pathway of its golden car. Philadelphia Album, April 1, 1829 (From American Manufacturer) JUVAT REMINISCI It is not all I can forget, Though dark and waste my spirits be, And earthly hopes that linger yet, Shine cold as watch-lights on the sea. So far from all that hath been dear, So much from others' love estranged, While year hath followed after year, My heart at length might well be changed. Yet earth must lay a chilling touch Upon affection's sunny flow, Ere every stream we prized so much, The music of its path forego. The soul may weep o'er its repose When all its stir of love is o'er; The tears it gave to others' woes Shall darkly now its own deplore. Yet oft our hearts from all they meet In sadness and in sickness turn; And feel that it is far more sweet, Over their buried joys to mourn. Then thoughts of those we warmly loved, And who perchance did love as well, Though long, alas, and far removed, Like blessings on our spirits dwell. They wake to life the little joys, Which leave us lonely when they die; And hopes, the best that time destroys, Call from the ruins where they lie. Though underground our dear ones sleep, We'll think as fondly on the dead, And in our darker sorrows weep Such tears as mirth might sigh to shed. Though I may roam through pleasure's bowers, And talk and smile as others do, My soul shall keep its better hours, Past years, remembered loves, for you. New England Weekly Review April 13, 1829 TARIFFIANA, NO. 2 (âThe only true policy for America is entire freedom of trade. Every other system is false, delusive, and hazardous.â Liverpool Advertiser) Hark! the voice of John Bull, who with fatherly care, Still watches the nation he governed of old, And breathes for its weal a benevolent prayer, Whenever the tale of our greatness is told! Take heed to its warning;âthe wisdom of agesâ In disinterested benevolence proffered; Each word of advice, and each maxim, worth pages Of all that our short-sighted statesmen have offered. Fools!âfools! that ye are, will ye listen to themâ To Jefferson, Clinton, and Madison when Immaculate Britain is heard to condemn The maxims that governed those prejudiced men? Why talk of our statesmen?âthe thought is absurd, From Britain your notions of policy drawâ Henceforth be the voice of our leaders unheard, And the nod of John Bull understood as a law. Hurra for Old England!âlet that be the cry, Which shall gladden the arrogant lord of the waves; Hurra for John Bull!âlet it ring to the sky 'Till the ghosts of your fathers shall start from their graves. Let the eagle that soars with the wings of the stormâ The bird of our country, his wanderings check; Bend lowly in homage the pride of his form, That the foot of the Lion may rest on his neck. Such is England's adviceâwill ye dare disobey, And call her kind counsel the whisper of guile? Shall the thought of your fathers a moment outweigh The love which ye bear to the âfast-anchoredâ isle? Haverhill Gazette, April 18, 1829 TO A STAR Wonderful, yet familiar! fadeless gem, Set by the hand of angels, in the arch Of the eternal heaven! how beautiful Thy soft light resteth on the unquiet sea, That gathereth up its waves, as if the winds Of yesterday, were prisoned in its depths And struggling to be free! The hazy clouds, Pale relics of the recent storm have drawn Their thin grey shadows out upon the sky, And curtained in its beauty. Thou alone Lookest upon the darkness. The great wave That cometh upward to the guarded shore, With its eternal thunder, hath received Thy solitary beam, yet pauses not In its mad turbulence. So have I seen The light of woman's love poured out upon The darkness of man's soul, yet hushing not The tempest of its passionsâa blest beam Crossing the troubled surges of the mind, Like moonlight glimpsing on a sky of storm. Sole watcher of the heavens! I have not learned Chaldea's mystic faith, yet thou dost seem The emblem of a solitary heart, Companionless like mine. No kindred star Hath gladness in thy presence; and thy light Falleth upon the waters like the love Of a young heart upon the hollow world, Unanswered, unregarded. New England Weekly Review, June 29, 1829 (From American Manufacturer) THE IMPRISONED He started from his sleep,âthe chain Clanked on his stirring limb, The fatal truth came back again, Like an echoed curse to him. Chained and aloneâhis proud heart rose, Like a tided river then, And his curse went forth as the Samiel goes, To the doomed abodes of men. Ye've bound your gyves upon the hand, And fettered down the form, And trampled on the freeman's land, With his father's blood yet warm. Ye've bound me where the sun is not, Where the star-light never falls, But ye humble not the kingly thought That mocks your guarded walls. The soulâthe godlike soul is free, Its glory is not dim, It gathers sterner energy From every tortured limb. Dream ye that feelings nursed as mineâ Are touched by human ill? The form beneath its chains may pine, The soul is mighty still. And heavier ye may bind the chainâ My spirit shall not quail, Though madness revel on my brain The heart shall never fail. Ye cannot crush itâfor the deep, And burning sense of wrong, Through every weary hour shall keep Its thirst of vengeance strong. That sleepless vengeance! it will comeâ A whirlwind upon earth. The dungeon stoneâthe very tomb Shall send its summons forth. The injured spirit sleepeth not,â It may not be confinedâ The tyrant's hand hath never wrought A fetter for the mind. Haverhill Gazette, July 11, 1829 (From American Manufacturer) THE BRIDAL âOh! haud ye not the feast tonightâ The wassail hour delayâ The glimmer o' a cauld corse light Comes up the murky brae:â It lights some frien's or neighbor's wrath Up to the auld kirk wall, It bodeth illâit bodeth deathâ Make dim the festal hall. âBlau out the lightsâthe merry lights Send a' the minstrels hame, And let the band o' worthy knights Gang backward as they came. There's muckle evil lurkin' near, Wi' sights an' sounds of awe, The young bride's cheek hath felt the tearâ The bridegroom is awa'.â Out spake the bride's proud father then, Wi' blended fear and rageâ âFair dame,â he said, âan' merry men, Why heed ye croakin' age? Cheer thee, my daughterâlet nae fear For Keven dim thine eye, The hour that should hae found him here, Ye ken is hardly by.â Call out the minstrelsâpour the wineâ Strike up a merrier strain, Mair brightly let the tapers shine, Lead down the dance again.â The dance went down the hall once mairâ Flashed out the festal sheenâ The fair bride's cheek, through falling hair In a tearful smile was seen. The castle clock smote out the hours, Wi' slow an' solemn chime; And the bridesmaid dropped her wreath o' flowers, As she thought o' the midnight time. Sair wept the brideâthe father smote His strong hand on his brow; An' the dancer did na' hear the note O' the merry music's flow. A hornâ'twas Keven'sârang withoutâ A shrill unearthly tone, An' the heavy curtain flapped about, An' the old hall seemed to groon, Nae warder's trumpet made reply, Nae door was open'd there, But a heavy tread came slowly by, As an armed knight it were. The music ceasedâthe tread came onâ A form is with them now,â Saints help thee, bride!âis this the one Who hath thy virgin vow? An armed knightâhis helm was raisedâ His face was unco pale, An' his lip was white, an' his e'en were glazedâ Red bluid was on his mail. He spake nae wordâhe took the han' O' Agnes in his ain', An' the grey auld monk couldna but stan' Before the awesome twain. A' tremblingly he spake the word Which made them e'en as one; An' the many guests in silence heard The awfu' ritual done. The bridgegroom turned frae the holy man An' led his bride awa',â The guests sat still an' raised nae han' Within that silent ha'; They passed awa'âthe strong doors turned As wi' an unseen power; An' the lamp o' a feeble meteor burned To light them frae the tower. There was wailing in that castle longâ The bride came not againâ The master shunned his vassal throng And the minstrel's idle strain. An' the peasant tells a fearsome tale By his evening fireside O' the gentle girl an' the knight in mailâ The spectre an' his bride. Philadelphia Album, August 12, 1829 TO MY COUSIN No, Cousin, no,âeach gentle word, Of thine is unforgotten yet, That sweet low voice in boyhood heard, E'en manhood's pride may not forget. I do not tell thee this to flatter Thy vain young heart with words of passion, For love has grown a playful matter, And sentiment is out of fashion. The world has given a different tone To feelings which it cannot bridle; And manhood would disdain to own The worship of its earthly idol. Nay, Cousin,âit is idle now, To linger on the past, or cherish, A thought of that unmeaning vow Whose very nature was to perish. For many months we have not metâ And yet they say thy mood is cheerful, They say thy cheek is rosy yet And that thine eye is seldom tearful, That in the gay and crowded hall The mazes of thy dance are highestâ Thy voice the freest one of all, The glances of thine eye the brightest, That broken-hearted lovers yet Are thronging round thee by the dozenâ That thou art still a gay coquetteâ And it is so, my gentle cousin! I hope it isâfor thou art one Unfitted for a weary trial, A thing to perish when the sun Is shrouded from thy spirit's dial! Yet what of this, thou art not sighing Of slighted love to flower and tree, And little dost thou think of dying For such a worthless thing as me. Yet, Cousin, those were pleasant times, When we were in the moonlight straying With hearts as idle as the rhymes With which my careless pen is playing. 'Twas pleasant to behold thee lift Thy dark eyes to the blue sky o'er us, With brow as fair as mountain drift, When polished by the wing of Boreas. Cousinâthese days have vanished now, And love's mild glance would ill befit The darker lip and haughtier brow With anguish and ambition writ. I blame thee not that thou hast lent The blessing of thy love to others, Although my own was never meant To be but as a friend's or brother's. But time hath worked a changeâperhaps, The better for a heart like mine, And though it may at times relapse, And worship at its older shrine, Yet, Coz, it were an idle thing Of other days and loves to speak; And idle were thy hopes to bring A tear on manhood's bearded cheek. Farewell, sweet cousin!âthou are young, And wealth, and mirth, and love surround thee; And Iâa wreck of beingâflung Upon a sea that darkened round me. Forgetâforgive the dreamy part Which thou and I have acted o'er; Goâkindle in another heart The flame that burns in mine no more. When marriedâfor acquaintance sakeâ Good Cousin, I am sure you'll do itâ Just send a piece of bridal cake And Iâwill write a sonnet to it. New England Weekly Review August 17, 1829 THE BURIAL OF ABNER The heavy night cloud sundered, the red sun Rolled upward from the eastâa blazing world! And the grey mists that gather nightly on Judea's awful mountain heads, unfurled Their shadowy banners, and in long wreaths curled Before the eye of Heaven until they caught The living glories which its presence brought. Then leaped the waves in sunlight, as the breeze Went over nature like a spiritâbreaking The mirrored slumber of the dreaming seas, And the deep music of the forest waking Upon a thousand unseen harps, and shaking The pleasant perfumes of the earth abroad,â Nature's best offering at the shrine of God. Yet men had gathered in that glorious lightâ Strong, warrior men that recked not of its gladnessâ Eyes, that rolled fiercely under brows of night, And swart hands clenched, as in convulsive madness,â Hearts, which were torn with blended hate and sadness, Mournful yet troubled, like the tempered wrath, Of Ocean heaving in the moonlight's path. Bent the mailed forms in silence, as the bier Rested before them with its sleeper pale, Strong hands were clasped, and manhood's guarded tear Stained the dark cheek and trembled on the mail. It was a time for giant hearts to fail From the nursed pride of warriors, Death was thereâ A hero's requiem moaned upon the air. One warrior's lip curled haughtily; beneath A battered helm and plume in battle shorn, An eye of kingly seemingâdark as deathâ Gloomy with hate and terrible with scorn, Flashed o'er the kneeling formsâthe monarch bornâ Tall chief and bearded Levite, bending there, In the hushed awfulness of inward prayer. Guilt struggling with ambitionâpride with shame, How terrible the conflict! Men of blood! On thy scarred cheek the fearful shadowings came, When cross the dark soul in its stormiest mood! Yet thou alone of all that multitude Stood up in stately manhood, seeming not To note the ruin which thy hand had wrought. Ground heavily the tombstoneâall was doneâ The sepulchre received its silent guest;â The Levite's prayerâthe chanted requiem tone Were hushed around the slumberer's place of rest. Slow rose from earth each humbled warrior's crest And tearful eyes flashed wrathfully upon The dark, still form of that unweeping one. And Israel's monarch lifted up his head, Baring his pale brow to the light of heavenâ A brow, whereon the multitude might read The trial of a spirit which had striven With the great sense of wrong, to which was given Unwonted power and eloquence to shed A prophet's malin on the murderer's head. He bent his eye on Joab. The proud chief Quailed from his glance as if he dared not gaze On his wronged monarch; but the strife was brief, And haughtily the pride of other days Came o'er his spirit, and the dark eyes blaze, The firm clenched lip, the marked and steadfast brow Told that the strong man might not tremble now. Dark terrible man! in silent power he stood Above his mighty victim. There was heard An awful voice denounce his deed of blood, Yet on his brow no pulse of terror stirred, His form stood up untrembling, as the word Of Israel's monarch poured its sorrows forth O'er the chill tenant of the halls of earth:â âDweller of the soundless grave! Bravest of the passing braveâ Eagle-soul in Glory's sun Thou hast led thy chosen on Tingeing Kedron's mountain flood With the stain of heathen blood, Sweeping from the path of war Grim Philistia's sworded car!â Gathered to thy fathers now, Earth is on thy helm-worn brow,â Cold the form that grappled well With the giant infidel, Chained the voice, whose thunder call Bade the lifted lances fall, And thy legions breast the shock Of the war-cloud, rolling on, Steadfast as some mountain rock When the torrent thunders down. Not to me or mine belong Traitor kiss and deadly wrong. Traitor! is the curse of Heaven Deeply to thy spirit given,â Nameless ills which have their birth Only from the crimes of earthâ Serpent thoughts that ever twine Round a spirit lost as thineâ Shadows falling cold and dun, Cloud-like on thy being's sun, Phantoms in the sunlight gliding, Spectres at thy couch abiding,â Traitors in thy path abroad, Traitors at thy household board,â Every ill that mocks reliefâ Haunt thy bosomâhaughty chief!â The monarch ceased. The murderer trembled notâ But a strange shadow veiled his spirit, when, As the last terrors of the curse were wrought, Rose from around, the deep response, âAmen.â He felt the malin in his bosom then, Yet turned him proudly from his victor's tomb With a strong heart to wrestle with his doom. Haverhill Gazette, August 22, 1829 (From American Manufacturer) FROM A RECENT POEM IN THE PHILADELPHIA ALBUM Lady farewell! I know thy heartâ Its angel strength to rise above The cold reserveâthe studied art That mock the glowing wing of love. Its thoughts are purer than the pearl That slumbers where the wave is driven, Yet freer than the winds that furl The banners of the clouded heaven. And thou hast been the brightest star That shone along my weary wayâ Brighter than rainbow colorings are,â A changeless and enduring ray. Nor will my memory lightly fade From thy pure dreams, high-thoughted girl! The ocean may forget what made The blue expanse of waters curl, When the strong wind hath passedâthe sky In its rich sunshine may forget The recent cloud that floated byâ The glories of its last sunset; But not from thy unchanging mind Will fade the dreams of other years; And love will linger far behind In memory's resting place of tears. Haverhill Gazette, August 22, 1829 MEMORY âMemory with a spectre's fingers Scatters torn flowers o'er what hath been.â Fairfield's Clara Farewell! if this be only A lightly spoken word, Why should the heart be lonely As a mate-forsaken bird! If its meaning be not deeper Than its simple sound would seem, Why should it haunt the sleeper And mingle in his dream? Tearfully we parted, In the utmost hush of even, When above the weary-hearted Looked tearfully the heaven. And a long farewell was spoken Which thy heart might not forget, I have lost full many a token, But that is living yet. 'Tis a loved page in my story, A sun-ray in my dream, Turning to rainbow glory What else would darkness seem. Though darkly memory giveth Its visions of the past, Yet while that picture liveth, I would that it might last. Stanzas 1, 7, 8 Philadelphia Album, September 9, 1829 THE DREAM OF THE MISANTHROPE I went away from the haunts of men In a fairy-rowed canoe; And the emerald hills and the old church spire First lessened and then withdrew. The sea was around me bright and calm As the smile of a sleeping child, And beautiful clouds of a thousand hues Against the sky were piled. In truth 'twas a goodly sight and grandâ That sea without a shore,â The dreaming clouds, and the moving bark With its invisible oar. Awayâaway, at an earthless speedâ Away from guilty men,â The white foam lightened around my track, And I laughed for pleasure then. The wonderful things of Ocean shone Right under the cutting keel; The star-fish lay on a diamond stone In the coil of the golden eel,â The Merman sat in his coral chair Like a chieftain of the sea, But he frowned when he saw his partner wave Her beautiful arm to me. Soft eyes looked up from the sunny deep With their smiles of love and mirthâ Wild passionate eyes, that would laugh to shame The brightest ones of Earth, And the young forms danced on the pearly floor, And wreathed their arms of snow; And sang their beautiful lays of love, To a music sweet and low. I had hated music, because it came From the vulgar lips of men, But I gave my soul to the witchfulness Of those ocean-voices then. I had hated womanâbecause I knew Her love was a changeful gem, But I knew those ocean-girls were true, And I gave my heart to them. I came at last to an isle that seemed Like an emerald set in gold, For a rich and pleasant sunshine robed The waves that about it rolled. My bark went up to a narrow beach, Made snow-white by the sun, Where the streams came down in search of the sea, And I laughed to see them run. A beautiful shape of ocean birth Held out her delicate hand, And she took my own, and I followed her To that green and pleasant land. Its streams were pure, and its musical shades Bore not the trace of menâ And over its green and silken grass No human foot had been. And this was mineâI sat me down And for every joy I wept, While the broad and beautiful trees about In the living sunshine slept. The sea-girls came to the white sea-beach, And danced in Nature's glee, And they brought their treasures of ocean pearl, And gave them all to me. Rich fruits hung down to the laughing streams, With a strange inviting smell, And a bird went by on a thousand wings In the sunlight painted well. The chime of the waves was soft and low, As the mermaid's gentle strain, And oh! I prayed that I might not know The human voice again. Yet even then I thought of home,â Of the speaking human faceâ I thought of the grey familiar church And its shady burial place. I knew that those I loved were there, In their last and pleasant sleep; I had wept for them; but I knew for me There was not an eye to weep. And a shadow fell upon my soul, In that most pleasant isle; And I did not see the light waves fall, Nor watch the mermaid's smile; And I felt that Earth in its pride had not A balm for the spirit riven,â That all the hopes of the human heart Were vain but the hope of Heaven! Haverhill Gazette, September 12, 1829 PASSAGES FROM âTHE VESTALâ She leaned against a gorgeous pillar, wrought With most unwonted workmanship; the flame Burned in the distance, and the moonlight fell Through the transparent arching of the roof, In glory round her form, revealing all Its exquisite proportions, for the robe Which veiled her young but ripened beauty, seemed Light as if woven by a fairy's hand Of texture borrowed of the moonlight air. Oh she was passing fair!âPygmalion Woke not a lovelier into breathing life From the cold shape of his idolatry. Her brow was as a white scroll lifted up To the dark outline of her clustering hair, Most eloquent with thought. Her eye was dark, Yet tempered with the softness of her clime. Its long lash seemed to slumber; and her cheek Blushed with the passionate coloring of thought. but her thoughts Had wandered from their trust, and her young heart Was beating with another feeling now, Than that of meek devotion. ... Whose tall form Is stealing towards her, noiseless as the shade Of the old pillars, shrouded in the garb Of Vesta's virgins?â. ... Morning was over Italy. ... There was a flood of pleasant sunlight poured Through the long arches where the moon had thrown Her milder gift upon the temple floor, And round the Vestal's shrine. That shrine was cold. The sacred flame had perished. Dark, cold stains Were on the polished marbleâstains of blood; There were two graves, Piled carelessly among the menial deadâ The tombless and uneulogized of Romeâ The stained with crime and outcast; and therein Slept a young warrior, in whose frozen veins Patrician blood had burned; and at his side The beautiful watcher of the idol shrineâ The fallen Vestal who had died with him. Haverhill Gazette, November 21, 1829 (From Yankee and Boston Literary Gazette) AUTUMN The pleasant sun is going up Painting sere grass and old wood top; The frost upon the meadow land Like curtain wove by fairy hand Is glowing underneath his beam; And morning's vapor pale and thin, Is melting off from every stream That drinks the blessed sunlight in. Spring hath its glories,âwhen the gush Of music cometh like the wave That murmurs through the coral bush, And round the marble architrave Of the Deep's stony Paradiseâ The untrampled garden of the waters, Where song and loveliness entice The listening down to Ocean's daughters; And warmer sky and greener earth, And deeper cloud and higher sun,â Calling young flowers and green leaves forth From every spot she gazes on. And Summer hath a dower of prideâ Dark verdure on her mountain sideâ The lively rainâthe voiced cloudâ The thunder on the hill-tops bowedâ The greenness of her forest treeâ The breezes of her summer seaâ The fervor of her kindling noonâ The quiet of her night of moon. But Autumn cometh pale and sere, With stricken heart and faded wreath, To bend above the dying year And yield the living up to Death!â The winds are hoarser round her way, The flowers receive her breath and dieâ Earth's greenness changes to decay; And withers at her passing by. Yet there are scenes most beautiful, Which chequer Autumn's changeful reign, As on the eye with sorrow dull Some fitful smiles will play again. There is a quiet beauty now On all the living things of God; And Nature gladdens in the glow The grateful morning sends abroad. The oak upon the windy hill Yet wears its garb of summer green; The hemlock by the moaning rill In its perennial garb is seen While the white birch's graceful stem Bears lightly up its gorgeous flowerâ The changeful frost-work of an hour, And the rude walnut bough receives The sun upon its crowded leaves, Each colored like a topaz gem; And the tall maple wears with them The coronal that Autumn givesâ The harbinger of ruin nearâ The wreath that Desolation weaves Around the sunset of the year. Oh! seem not human glories dim, With Nature thus unveiled before us, Most glorious from the hand of Him Whose starry curtain bendeth o'er us! And may not hearts alive to all The blessedness of Earth and Heaven, Feel Nature's pure religion fall Upon them like the dew of even;â And gather from unbreathing things The spiritual holiness of prayerâ And soar on high, as angels' wings Were tracing out our pathway there! The Original, January, 1830 BEAUTY A warning to a beautiful girl lest she be too gay. Oh, turn thee from thy gladsome hours, And from the smiles that light thy way;â The garner of life's fading flowers, The funeral torches of Decay! Oh, turn from these, for they will pass Like dew from off the shaken grass, Or like the dream that glideth by The vision of the sleep-sealed eye; Ay, Hope and Love may pass away, Before one raven tress be grey! But there is Hopeâand when the heart By wrong, and guilt and shame is riven, It points us to the âbetter part,â The pure and blessed light of Heaven! What though the way of life become A desert of unbroken gloom, Still to Contrition's eye of tears, A ray of promised bliss appears,â A guiding radiance sent abroad, To call the pilgrim home to God! Haverhill Gazette, March 27, 1830 THE FAREWELL Farewell;âI feel that thou and I, Must part even now, perhaps forever; I heard last night thy long good bye And chained but with a proud endeavor The smothered tide of tearful feelingâ I could not bear that other eyes Should smile upon the heart's unsealing Of all its hidden sympathies. Ohâwas it not a mocking thing At that last hour of parting sadness Over the fount of tears to fling The light and careless smile of gladness! Yesâsadder eyes were fixed on theeâ And sadder tones bespoke regret; And trembling hands were proffered free, And young, fair cheeks with tears were wet; And Iâthe saddest one of allâ Returned thy greeting with a smileâ That smile was for the crowded hallâ My heart was with thee all the while; And burning thoughts were thronging thereâ The hopes and fears affection hath To prompt its still, unuttered prayer For blessings on the loved one's path. They tell me thou wilt choose thee one Of brighter eyes and glossier curlsâ Among the âChildren of the Sunââ The silver-toned Italian girls; That she will love thee with the glow And joy of her voluptuous clime; And whisper music, like the flow Of soft winds in the summer time:â That when the moonlight sleepeth on Gay Venice and her many islesâ And when the gondolier alone May mark the dalliance hour of smiles, Thy arm will bear a yielding formâ Thy hand amid her tresses play, And fervent kisses soft and warm, Disturb at times her melting lay. Alas!âI would believe thee trueâ And yet I fear a change will come, And waste away like morning dew, Affection's rich and untold sum. For thou wilt roam in other lands, And other eyes will smile on thee, And thou wilt ask from other hands, The gifts which I have proffered thee; For I have seen thee in my dream Of feverish and unquiet sleeping, Devoid of all which man should seem When Love around his path is weeping. I've seen thee at the altar-side And listened to the rites which gave Unto thy arms another bride, And left forsaken loveâa grave! God grant my dreams may never prove Their stern reality of wrong; Nor make the meaning of thy love A ringâa promiseâand a song. I do believe thou lovest me nowâ But will thy boyish dream remain, When foreign suns have lent thy brow A darker and a manlier stain? And wilt thou love my memory, while Above thee bends the Italian sky? Or where the Grecian maidens smileâ Or where the Georgian dance goes by? Farewell!âforgive the doubts which fling A shadow on our parting hour,â Nor deem my heart a wayward thingâ A jealous and ungentle dower: For woman's love is blent with fearsâ Her confidenceâa trembling oneâ Her smileâthe harbinger of tearsâ Her hopeâthe change of April's sun! Farewell!âand oh! where'er thou art, Indulge at times a thought of me, And I will soothe my trembling heart In one long dream of love and thee. New England Weekly Review July 26, 1830 TO THE AUTHOR OF THE IMPROVISATRICE I know thee not, high Spirit! but the sympathy of thought Hath often to my hour of dreams thy living presence brought; And I feel that I could love thee with the fondness of a brother, As the sainted ones of Paradise bear love for one another. For I know thy spirit hath been poured full freely in thy song, Where feeling hath been prodigal, and passion hath been strongâ That the secrets of thy bosom are burning on thy lyre, In the nature of thy worshipping, a ministry of fire. Young priestess at a holy shrine, I scarce can deem that years So few and beautiful as thine are registered in tearsâ That the gift of thy affections hath gone abroad in vainâ A rose-leaf on the autumn windâa foam-wreath on the main! Yet blended with thy beautiful and intellectual lays, I read a mournful consciousness of cold and evil days; If the weariness existence feels when its sunlight has gone down, And from the autumn of the heart the flowers of hope are strown; Of the coldness of the hollow world, its vanities that pass Like tinges from the sunset or the night-gems from the grassâ In mocking and unmeaning praise, the flatterer's fatal artâ Flowers to the bosom clasped, with serpents at their heart! And oh! if things like these have been the chastening of thy years, How hath the woman's spirit known the bitterness of tears! How have thy girlhood visionsâthe warm, wild thought of youth, Folded their sunny pinions and darkened into truth! O wearily, most wearily, unto the child of song, The heavy tide of being rolls, a sunless wave alongâ When the promise of existence fades before the time of noon, And the evening of the soul comes on, unblest by star or moon! God help thee in thy weary way! and if the silver tone, Of Fame hath music for an ear so chastened as thine own, Thou hast it from another clime, where heart and mind are free, And where the brave and beautiful have bowed themselves to thee. And one whose home hath been among the mountains of the North, Where cataract mocks the earthquake, and the giant streams come forthâ Where spirits in their robes of flame dance o'er the cold blue sky, And to the many-voiced storm the eagle makes reply! A worshiper before the shrine at which thy spirit bendeth, While on its pure and natural gifts the holy flame descendeth, Hath poured his tribute on thine ear, as he would praise a star Whose beams had wandered down to him from their blue home afar. Lady! amidst the clarion-note of well-deserved fame, It were, perhaps, but vain to hope this feeble lay might claim A portion of thy fair regard, or win a thought of thine To linger on a gift so frail and dissonant as mine. But onward in thy skyward pathâa thousand eyes shall turn To where, like heaven's unwasting stars, thy gifts of spirit burnâ A thousand hearts shall wildly thrill where'er thy lays are known, And stately manhood blend its praise with woman's gentlest tone. Farewell!âthe hand that traces this may perish ere life's noon, And the spirit that hath guided it may be forgot as soonâ Forgotten with its lofty hopesâthe fevered dreams of mineâ Unnoted, stealing to the dead without a name behind. But thou upon the human heart, in characters of flame, And on the heaven of intellect hast registered thy name; The gifted ones of fallen earth shall worship at thy shrine, And sainted spirits joy to hold companionship with thine. Atheneum, August 15, 1830 THE DESTINY Ask not of me, thou dark-eyed one What may the future beâ Look to thy heartâand ask of none To read the stars for thee! Look back upon the silentness Of unreturning yearsâ The faded hours of early blissâ Of passion and of tears. Yet stayâthe spell is over meâ And I must speak thy doom! Like dark waves on a midnight sea Behold thy future come! Ay, bend thy brow as manhood mayâ And scoffing as thou wiltâ I see thee on thy future wayâ A haunted thing of guilt! Thou'rt hasting from thy native landâ With crime upon thy soul Not such as lifts the midnight brandâ The dagger or the bowl! No, thine hath been a guiltier partâ It hath a darker sealâ Thy pride hath crushed the human heart As with an iron heel! Go to the classic shrines of oldâ The tombs of mighty menâ Where desolation, grey and cold Telleth of what has been. Go dream beside the Parthenonâ Or by Grenada's wallsâ Or linger where the desert sun On Tadmor's ruins falls. Yet thereâthy dreams of power and gloom One thought shall glide betweenâ Above the hero's crumbled tomb The martyred one shall lean! And, through the old, deserted pile, That pale, still form shall glide And dimly in the pillared aisle Steal softly at thy side! Go mingle with the glad and gay, And bow at pleasure's shrineâ And Beauty's fairest forms shall lay Their gentle hands in thine, Yet thereâa spectreâever nighâ The injured one shall come And underneath Love's melting eye Shall turn thy smile to gloom! Go nowâthe lingering curse is given The spell is laid on theeâ The scorn of Earthâthe wrath of Heaven Is in thy destiny! Or on the land, or on the sea, In shadow or in sunâ That spectral form shall follow theeâ The broken-hearted one! New England Weekly Review, August 23, 1830 THE DYING Oh! bring me flowersâmy dearest, And wreathe them in my hair, The beautifulâthe fairest onesâ And let them wither thereâ Wild rose, and the fragile lilyâ The blossoms of a dayâ And twine them on the brow of one As perishing as they. I may not see them growing In wildwood or in glen, I may not tread upon the green And fragrant Earth again, Yet, leave the casement open, That the blue and blessed sky, The tree-tops and the pleasant hills May greet my closing eye! And gather ye around meâ The friends whom I have lovedâ The eyes that ever shone with mineâ The hearts that I have proved. In calm unweeping sorrow, Oh, let the loved draw near, And let each low, familiar tone Fall on the dying ear. I know that Death is near me, And yet I feel it notâ It is but shedding sunshine on The shadows of my lotâ A welcome from the spirits Of the pure and sin-forgivenâ The lifting of the curtain-fold Which shadows Earth from Heaven! New England Weekly Review, October 18, 1830 THE MOUNTAIN SPIRIT The day is spent. Dark night has come With frowning brow and dripping shroud, And led forth from their caverned home, The fiercest of her spirit-crowd; She leans upon the mountain's brow, And like a silent, living thing, Upon the misty fields below She spreads her broad mysterious wing. Roll on, ye clouds, from every pole, And veil the earth from moon and star; Dark, heaving, soundingâonward roll! Fiercely as when ye are at war;â For I shall roam the plain this night, Where sunlight hath so lately been; And I shall go in serried mightâ Veil ye the valley darkly, then. Ye lightnings, flash along the sky, And dance ye on the mountain's brow Ye thunders, peal your song on highâ Dash onward, wild and strangely now! Ye winds, awake your sleeping power, And, howling, go ye forth again! Arouse, ye spirits of the hour, And rush ye, trooping, o'er the plain! How wildly sweep the winds alongâ They ne'er have waked to fiercer glee; How loudly rings the thunder's songâ Its music hath a charm for me. It is the song to which I dance, And I will seek the pleasant vale, Long ere the morning's red advance, To revel with the midnight gale. The chilling fog shall veil my throng, And thickly lie upon my path; And shadowy forms shall rush along Like stalwart foemen in their wrath. Thick darkness shall unfurl her pinions O'er all beneath the floating sky; And her unseen and fearless minions, Shall plunge like bursting waters by. For I shall go in power this night, To wander with the lowland band; And we shall join our gathered might And tread the meadows hand in hand. Then we shall rush to Ocean's shore, And call her daughters from their pillows To listen to the breakers' roar, And dance upon the foaming billows. Wo, then, to keels the waters laveâ For we shall dash them on before! Wo, wo to him who sails the waveâ For he shall see his home no more! Wo to the loversâthey may wail Who gave fond tokens when they parted! Wo to the mother on the valeâ She surely will be broken-hearted! New England Weekly Review, July 7, 1831 THE DECLARATION We are not strangersâwe have met As carelessly as others doâ Thou, to smile on me and forget The form that passed before thy view; When others claimed thy smile and caught The music of thy silver toneâ And Iâto cherish in my thought Each look and motion of thine ownâ Each kindly wordâeach smile that lent New beauty to the playful lipâ Each blush that o'er thy fair cheek wentâ A pearl and coral fellowship,â Each movement of thy form of grace, Each tossing of thy waving hair,â All came before me like the trace Of half-forgotten dreams that were. With every hopeâwith every dream Of fame and powerâamidst the might Of conscious strengthâthy presence seems Around me like some holy light! And then I feel that all which earth Of power or glory might bestow Were vain and cold, and little worth As sunshine streaming over snow,â If thou were not the shrine whereon The garlands of my fame might blossomâ If that which lighted up my own, Woke not a thrill within my bosom! It may be that thou hast not given One gentle thought of thine to meâ That like some pure, bright star of even, Thou movest onward, âfancy freeââ Unmindful as that holy star Of ardent eyes to thee upturning Still in thy radiant sphere afarâ A blest and lonely radiance burning! Or it may be that in thy heart There lies some fond, remembered token Some sacred feeling held apart, Some cherished dream of love unspokenâ Perchance some form to fancy dear, Glideth before thy memory's eyeâ That still in slumber thou canst hear His whispered and his fond reply. And ohâif it be so, I ask Nor thought nor sacrifice from thee; And mine shall be the ungentle task To loveâwhen love can only be Like one who bows him down in prayer Before some veiled and mystic shrine, Even when the idol-glories there, May never on his worship shine! New England Weekly Review, August 8, 1831 THE WARRIOR A gallant form is passing by, The plume bends o'er his lordly brow; A thousand tongues have raised on high His song of triumph now. Young knees are bending round his way, And age makes bare his locks of grey. The gallant steed treads proudly on, His foot falls firmly now, as when In strife that iron heel went down Upon the hearts of men; And foremost in the ranks of strife, Trod out the last, dim spark of life. Dream they of theseâthe glad and gay, That bend around the conquerer's path? The horrors of the conflict dayâ The gloomy field of deathâ The ghastly stainâthe severed headâ The raven stooping o'er the dead. MenâChristians! pauseâthe air ye breathe Is poisoned by your idol now, And will ye turn to him, and wreathe Your chaplets round his brow! Nay, call his darkest deeds sublime, And smile assent to giant crime! Forbid it, heaven!âa voice hath gone In mildness and in meekness forth, Hushing before its silvery tone, The stormy things of earth; And whispering sweetly through the gloom An earnest of the peace to come. Stanzas 1, 4, 5, 7, 8 The Bouquet, November 5, 1831 THE BETROTHED BURNESE TO HER HEATHEN LOVER Perchance, when life hath passed away, My dust may claim from thee a sigh; That one who loved thee should decay, Though joy was in her dying eye; That clay which once was spirit-lit, Should mingle with its fellow-clod, Then thou may'st oft remember it:â Then when my soul is borne to God! Ah! I have loved thee, deep and longâ None but my heart its depth may tell! There is a penury in my song, To paint the indescribable! The gathering thoughtsâthe many fears, That shadowed o'er my fevered brow, That touched my cheek with bitter tears, And made me pale as I am now. And wilt thou bow in homage still, To darkness and idolatry? Oh, let me kneel and change thy willâ Once I was blindâbut now I see:â Lo! upon Faith's unclouded eye, The gleams of endless rest break in; Beyond the mystery of the sky, Where boundless Love's unstained by sin! Let it be thus! I would not live And lose the treasure I have won, The earth-born hopes may ne'er revive, To cheer the heart that feels thy scorn:â And should the tide of life roll on, In shadows and in misery, My soul shall turn from phantom's gone, And, my Redeemer, cling to thee! Stanzas 1, 2, 6, 7 Connecticut Mirror, November 12, 1831 THE LAST SLEEP When like a shade from Summer's sky, The darkness of this life shall ceaseâ When the unconscious breast shall lie In the still earth's funereal peace: How will the sleeper rest in dust, His clay with kindred clay be blent,â While the free spirit of the just Soars to a brighter element! There is a tranquilizing thought Comingled with the voiceless grave; 'Tis with no bitter memories fraughtâ It echoes not to Time's dull wave: Passion and Pride are passed away, And the deep slumberer sinks to rest, Like gilded clouds, when sunset's ray Is fading from the unbounded west. And the hot gusts of kindling wrath, Which lashed the bosom into storm; They darken not his changeful path, And the knit brow no more deformâ The throbbing heart is calm and hushed, The pulse of Hate is cold and still; And hopes, by sin and sorrow crushed, Rise not to vex the baffled will! Thus should it be! He slumbers now Sweet as the cradled infant's rest; No shadows cross that settled brow, On which the unfelt clod is pressed: From the sealed lid there steals no tearâ There is no care the eye to dim; And in his shroud reposing there, The vale's dull clod is sweet to him! Oh, who would wake the sleeper up, To walk earth's gloomy round again: To feel the drops from Sorrow's cup, Rise to the wild and fevered brain? Far rather, in their lowly bed, Let his pale ashes moulder onâ Since the Free Spirit is not dead, But to an endless life hath gone. Connecticut Mirror, December 17, 1831 THE FAT MAN Ohâwo for pursy gentlemenâ The short and thick of frame; With tun-like bodies that would put A Dutchman's vrou to shame!â Woâfor the round and bulky manâ The greasy and the fatâ The five feet high by four feet broadâ A walking tallow vat! I have a handsome country-seat And pleasant rooms in town, I keep a noble pair of steeds, For driving up and downâ My garb is of the costliestâ My steeds are dapple greyâ I've friends who sup with me by night, And dine with me by day. But I am one of those who bear The curse of fat with them, Enveloping their choicest gifts Like earth around a gem. And then I have an altitude Too Pygmean by far,â Out-measuring in circumference, My perpendicular. And with a spirit all alive, And sensitive and proud, I bear my massy frame about Amidst the jesting crowd;â And some will smile and all will stareâ And some will roar with laughter; And lanky skeletons will point Their bony finger after. The ladies, too, are dumb with fear, Or struggling with a smileâ Whene'er I make my awkward bow, And talk of love the while,â They turn them from my dashing greys, And from my country seatâ And love each needy skeleton That kneels before their feet. Ohâtell me not that mirth and joy To giant bodies fallâ Your over-grown and mammoth men Are melancholy all! Nayârather than âthis hill of fleshââ I'd be a Barber's postâ The mummy of an Esquimauxâ Or Calvin Edson's ghost. Haverhill Iris, January 28, 1832 THE LEAN MAN Woâfor the lean and lanky manâ The fleshless and the grimâ The pleasant light of merry joy May never rest on him!â The man whose ghostly shadow seems A long and narrow lineâ Who eats and drinks, yet groweth not, Like Pharaoh's evil kine. He sitteth at the dinner board, Cadaverous and cold, As was the veiled sketeton At Egypt's feast of old; Yet worketh well his lantern jaw, And fast his fingers fill,â Your fleshless ones are noted for Their gastronomic skill. He walketh in the market place Amidst the stirring throngâ A locomotive skeletonâ The bony and the longâ Like some wire-moved anatomy He passeth by aloneâ And men will pause, as if to hear The clash of bone on bone. The lean may scoff at grosser menâ 'Tis Envy's self aloneâ They all would change their skeletons For bodies over-grown. Ayârather than their form so lean And spectre-like and dry, They'd welcome Falstaff's portly front, Or Daniel Lambert's thigh. Haverhill Iris, February 4, 1832 STANZAS Written on reading the memoirs of Lucretia Maria Davidson, who died at the age of 17. Her poetical writings have attracted attention not only in this country but in Europe. Beautiful being! thou hast gone Unblemished from a sinful worldâ And, where the star of promise shone The pinion of thy spirit furled! And it may not be well to weep Above thy grassy sepulchre; Nor over Death's unheeding sleep The chords of vain affection stir:â For thou wert taken back to Him Who gave thee as a blessing here, Before an earthly cloud could dim The beauty of thy atmosphere!â A spirit of a higher mouldâ A being unallied to earthâ A gift of song which scarcely told Its eloquence and priceless worth, Ere it had passed away to God,â These were the tokens of thy stayâ Theseâthe bright treasures cast abroad Like sunbeams in thy youthful way. The smile of beauty sat upon Thy forehead like an eagle's crownâ Thy heart was as an altar stone On which the fire of Heaven came down, And kindled to a burning gem Each thought which genius scattered there, And glowing Fancy gave to them, The light which morning visions wear!â Peace to thy sleeping!âo'er the green And grassy quiet of thy bed, The beautiful in tears shall leanâ The strong man hush his stately tread. Thy songs shall live amidst the tall, Green places of thy native hills, And echo with the fountain-fall, And murmur with the sun-lit rills,â And fresher than the loveliest flower Which bloomed beneath the living eye, Thy fame shall know no Autumn hour, Or fold its greenness up to die!â New England Weekly Review, February 6, 1832 HOPE When the o'er burdened mind Sinks 'midst the turmoil and the strife of earthâ And mournful thoughts enshrined In the dark spirit, send their influence forth Like the cold whirlwinds, from the frozen North: When the beclouded eye Is dim and tearful in Affliction's hour, And in the bitter sky, The dusky legions of the tempest lour, And Sorrow's rain comes down o'er perished leaf and flower, What upon such a scene Can shed the radiance that from Heaven descendsâ That makes our pathway green: That gifts of glory to each blossom lends, And with the unsullied sky the smile of Eden blends? Is it the world's vain showâ The pomp and glitter of its fading things That o'er our paths can throw A ray, where Fate, with melancholy wings O'er treasured dreams of love, her midnight shadow flings? Hope hath brief dwelling hereâ Her pure white wing is folded but in Heaven: Yet oft the soul to cheer To the believer's way her smiles are givenâ To heal the wounded breast, by sin and sorrow riven! And onward, to the eye Of ardent faith, beyond that Desert Land, Her glorious mansions lie: There her bright form is lost on God's right hand, Hid in the eternal beams that round the blest expand. Stanzas 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8 Connecticut Mirror, February 11, 1832 STANZAS Forgive theeâayâI do forgive thee, And bless thee as we part, And pray that years may never leave thee My agony of heart. I call no shadowy malison Upon thy fair young brow, But would thy life might ever run As sunwardly as now. I know that I have knelt too lowly For smiles so oft withdrawn,â That trusting love received too slowly The lesson of thy scorn,â That thou hast had thy triumph hour, Unquestioned and complete, When prompted by a spell of power, I knelt me at thy feet. 'Tis over nowâthe spell is brokenâ The lingering charm hath fled, And pass away like thought unspoken, The vows which thou hast said; I give thee back thy plighted wordâ Its tone of love shall be Like music by the slumbrous heardâ A dreamer's melody. Go nowâthe light of Hope is on thee, Thy lover's claims are o'erâ A thousand smiles thy charms hath won thee They'll win a thousand more; For Beauty hath a charming spell, Upon the human will, Though false the heart it veils so well, It hath its homage still. Goâblue-eyed girl!âthe proud shall meet thee And gladden in thy smile, And flattery's pleasant lip shall greet thee, With the bland words of guile. Go, try the recklessness of Earth, With that young heart of thine, And lavish its unpractised mirth On Pleasure's every shrine. Thy pleasant path may yet be shaded,â A shadow cross thy sunâ The rosy wreath that Love has braided Fall from thee one by one. And yet thou hast my earnest prayer For blessings on thy way, That flowers may spring and blossom there Which know not of decay. The oak whereon the falling thunder Hath passed, may yet remain, The cliff by lightning torn asunder, May dare the storm again;â And I can bear myself so well, In manhood's sterner part That neither brow nor lip shall tell The ruin of the heart. Haverhill Iris, September 13, 1833 (From New England Weekly Review) PLEAD FOR THE SLAVE Oh Woman!âfrom thy happy hearth Extend thy gentle hand to save The poor and perishing of Earthâ The chained and stricken slave! Oh! plead for all the sufferings of thy kindâ For the crushed body and the darkened mind!â So shall the ancient Earth have not A nobler name than thine shall be:â The deeds by martial manhood wroughtâ The lofty energies of thoughtâ The spell of poesyâ These are but frail and fading honorsâthine Shall Time into Eternity consign!â Yeaâand when thrones shall crumble downâ And human pride and grandeur fallâ The herald's line of long renownâ The mitre and the kingly crownâ Perishing glories all! The pure devotion of thy generous heart Shall live in Heaven of which it was a part! The Liberator, April 26, 1834 (From An Anti-Slavery Album) THE EMERALD ISLE Brightly figured thy shores upon history's pages Where first the wild lays of the minstrel was known And the brightest of statesmen of poets and sages O'er the sea-girded isle of Hibernia shone. Fair island thy vales are embalmed in the story Which history telleth of ages gone by, Where Ossian's heroes strode onward to glory And ocean's wave answered their loud battle cry. Fair isle of the ocean the shamrock is closing Its foliage o'er many a dimly-seen pile Where entombed on the field of their fame are reposing The proud peerless chiefs of the Emerald Isle. And in far later years, with the purest devotion To the high cause of freedom full many a son Of the green shores of Erin, the gem of the ocean Fair evergreen laurels of glory has won. The martyred O'Neil and the gallant Fitzgerald On the bright list of glory forever shall stand, And fame circle Emmet, the eloquent herald That awakened the spirit and pride of his land. Stern patriots in vain to the tomb ye descended In the cause of your country since servitude vile Is still by the hand of the tyrant extended O'er the land of your fathers, the Emerald Isle. Fair isle of the ocean, thy race is not dwindled The sons of the mighty and valiant are thine. Once more may the spirit of freedom be kindled And liberty over thy valleys shall shine. O, disgrace not the memory of those who have perished In the high cause of justice, Hibernians, for you Let their pathway to fame be tenaciously cherished, As the course which yourselves should united pursue. On your shores let the watchfire of freedom be lighted And the world shall rejoice at its hope-beaming smile. The Lion of England shall shrink back affrighted, Nor dare plant his foot on the Emerald Isle. Hibernia, the tyrants may seek to degrade thee, Yet proud sons of science acknowledge their birth On thy sea-girded Island whose genius hath made thee The gem of the Ocean, the wonder of earth.</field>
