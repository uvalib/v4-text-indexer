      <field name="fulltext">THE GHOST'S ENTRY, ETC. THE GHOST'S ENTRY The candle flutters and darkles. There is no sound within. The embers from ashes redden; One flame crawls spectral and thin. The candle flutters and darkles. Wide and black is the doorâI start! ... The Wind was the ghost that entered, And shook me and chilled my heart. OTHO IN THE TOMB OF CHARLEMAGNE When Otho, in the Tomb of Charlemagne, Faced the gigantic Skeleton, alone With orb and sceptre, crowned, upon his throneâ The mighty king who had not ceased to reignâ Shaken with sudden fear, he saw, instead, Death, crowned, with orb and sceptre there, and fled! POOR MOTH Poor Moth, that, fluttering through my candle's flame, Die of your sudden passion for the light;â From the great outer gulf of night you came, Then pass into utter night! THE OLD PIANO'S PLAYER AT A COUNTRY HOUSE IN OHIO It stands here in the empty house. ... What dream-wrought tones are these! Her fingers from the Past are reached, and wake the enchanted keys. Lo, shapes of grace, an eager group, about her lightly press: What pulses music-quickened beat! O eyes of tenderness! Sweet-hearted songs arise from sleep. The spell of Youth and Love Warms long-hushed lips again with speech: old dreams to music move. ... Yes, the gay hearts are ashes now, responsive long ago. ... To phantom fingers on the keys lost voices ebb and flow. A TRAGEDY OF LONG BRIDGE Near the Virginia end of Long Bridge, at Washington, was once a slave-pen, and many years ago, it is said, a tragedy, somewhat similar to that related here, took place upon the bridge. Across Long Bridge a woman with her child Hurriesâwhat backward glances quick and wild! Dark is her face with Nature's mask of woe; She is a slaveâyes, this was long ago. Behind her lay Virginia in the sun; Before her shone the dome of Washington. Behind her Slavery burdened day and dream; Before her Freedom held a high, faint gleam. The North Star. Behind her, like a bloodhound in her track, Came her fierce master, strong to drag her back. Behind, before herâif she dreamed, or saw, I know notâlo, the bond-securing Law! The Fugitive Slave Law. Panting she passes now the central tide, Where the deep river shines on either side. Hark! clamorous men behind her follow fleetâ Faster she flies with wild and piteous feet; See!âwho approach her from the Northern shore? She pauses, turns; she looks behind, before! âStop her!ââthe servants of the Law behind:â All must obey, though Pity speak, âBe blind!â She stands, all tremulous, helpless, looking round. They close about herâshe will soon be bound! Hard arms are stretchedâshe springs with one shrill scream, Her child close-prest, and sinks into the stream! Baffled her master stands with raging breathâ Law cannot reach the Slave's Deliverer, Death. ... Yes, it was long ago; but still at night Across Long Bridge is seen the piteous flight. Still, sometimes,âwho has seen I do not knowâ Is seen the dreadful chase of long ago. Fierce shouts are heard: lo! shapes of shadow runâ A dusky woman's, with her babe, is one! Hark! a last shriekâthe shrill appeal to Death! ... The water laps the pier with marshy breath. WRECK I After the tempest-roar The shell sighs on the shore. A ship shines, rosily, One sail-gleam, far at sea. Waves toss, near by, a mastâ The last Hope climbed it last. II After the tempest-roar The shell sighs on the shore. A maiden, by the sea, Sees the sail shine rosily. On shore the mast is flungâ The dead Hope, dying, clung! AWAKE IN A HAUNTED HOUSE In the olden mansion lying, That knew me long ago, I see the frozen river, Without, in still bright snow. The moon, so close by the window, Hangs in the tree;âwith her light, A glitter of motionless silence, All the ice-lit boughs are bright. Jarring the drowsy stillness, There are footsteps on the stair, Uplifting their ghostly echoes From the chambers everywhere. How near they startle the stairway!â I feel the opening door! Now, far and fainter and dying, They echo in me no more. In a moment the door will open,â How near they grow again! ... They have left their dreadful silence Walking within my brain. Upon the empty stairway I have heard them often before; In this olden house, returning, They haunt me evermore. Strangers have never heard themâ I know they all are mine, Rising, O heart, and dying On that haunted stair of thine! ... O life, make braver thy beating. The terror on the stair Is the long dread procession That follows thee everywhere! THE DEAD STAR Yonder, in empty dark, Wanders, somewhere, a wasted sun, whose light, Erst breathed abroad with life-creating spark, Made hanging gardens of the circling night. Through Time's dark emptiness, Some soul, that genius lit, goes, withered, wan, Its flame to blackness fallen, purposeless;â The dead star wanders with the fire-spent man. THE UNBIDDEN GUEST ON THE DEATH OF A BRIDE Ah, many a door He jars with welcome knock! To the o'erburthened breast, Through the dark hall, His footstep gives no shock, But seems a sound of rest. O Uninvited! every street hath such, Enough, enough for Thee! Hunger and Cold, they bless Thy kindred touch, And ask Thy company! ... Lo, one glad house by Love had lighted been With his first, soft, sweet Moon, And Life, the Bidden Guest, had just come inâ Followed by Thee how soon! Sudden the lamps grow dark, a stealthy cold Palsies the joyous room;â The young man's place is taken by the old, Dark, deaf, dumb, sightless Groom! The marriage greetings falter in speechless pain; Blithe bells, your toll we hear! ... The bridal party, 'tis her funeral train; The bridal bed 's her bier! THE SILENT PASSENGER On seeing a laden coffin one winter night taken on board my railway train. What homes are waiting now With doors ajar, with quickening heartsâthe smile Of firelit quiet touching lip and browâ For us, far off the while! Tidings have gone beforeâ Swift messengers, that traverse without fear Darkness as day, whispering through many a door Whose threshold knows us near! For some, perchance, the years Have travelled with their faces that to-night Returnâah, yes, for change, and Time, and tears!â Where breathed their morning light. And some but yesterday, Kissed parting lips, then smiling dared to part, Trusting to-morrow, with its constant ray, Should light heart back to heart. ... But who is he?âwhat door Is open now for him?âwhat mother stands Yearning to fold her wanderer safe once more From the world's restless sands? What faithful one, beside Hope's gentle watchfire, waits for Love's new bliss?â What children, playing in Time's crawling tide, Hold lips for father's kiss? One silent passenger, In the quick press of eager tongue and brain! Whither? I know not, nor who waits him there.â He travels on the train! O travellers, near or far! Remember, loosening hands,âah, clasp again!â The silent passenger in yonder car,â Death goes on every train! DREAM-WORLD Dear, beautiful, far Land! Where all these foot-sore, world-bent wanderers go, Leaving their burden and the restless woe Of the fierce flying sand! Thither all travel: there Grey thorn-crowned kings find quick content, uncrowned; The goaded slave, his treadmill bands unbound, Breathes its unguarded air. Thither go glad at night All hapless exiles in this foreign mart, Finding the old ways reopened in each heart Into forgotten light. There the lost child is found: ... O gentle school-boy, vanished from our sight, Fling your gay ball and fly your happy kite In that enchanted ground! There, fast as in far years, Are fallen heart-temples, fond-remembered homes: Through Death-locked doors each face familiar comes Smilingâwe wake with tears! ... How far, yet near, it seems!â This dusty world struck underfoot awayâ Circling lost suns, and sweet with happier day, The holy sphere of dreams! THE DEAD HOUSE-FIRE An hour ago the fireside gleamed, And merry faces and glances beamed. Mother and children, with happy sire, A garland of gladness, wreathed the fire. There were loving voices and laughing eyes, Whispers of joy and soft replies. Ghost-like in the darkness flutters a flame, Then drops in the ashes whence it came. Ghost-like in the gloom the faces grow, Then fade in my heart with the ember-glow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">QUATRAINS I FEUDAL TENURE On an Estate near Edinburgh. Vide Margaret Warrender's Walks near Edinburgh. An old estate bestowed on some one dear, (For love, not gold, Love his best boon bestows,) The deed provided onlyâyear by yearâ The tenant should make payment of a rose. II SAINT CECILIA (For Picture.) In high cathedral hush, in holy light, Rapt at her organ, Saint Cecilia stands. Her voice angelic takes its heavenward flight; Above her soar and sing celestial bands. III AT AN ANCIENT SHRINE (In Ireland.) Oh, Mother-Church! Thine earliest Western light Was kindled here, where yet it burns to-day!â Blind with excess of seeing, give me, too, sight; Borne helpless hither, let me walk whole away! IV APPRECIATION AND VALUE In Curio's hoard of coins we see how old Copper, rust-green, outranks new-minted gold. One keeps the ghost of some lost empire's sway, One buys the harvest of the world to-day. V AT BURIAL SERVICE âIt might have been,â we sigh, and then we heave To its deep grave our coffin silently; But our dark tears some unknown gleam receive,â We lift our eyes and say: âIt still may be.â VI AFTER-WEALTH Diamonds in tropic river-beds, they say, Are found when the fierce floods are drained away; So, in our lives, where passion-torrents flow No more, shine wisdom's precious stones below. VII NEW LIFE The Nightâit passes, like a burdening dream; Quickened, I walk along a happy shore, While low despairs, like mist upon the stream, Climb, wondering at the sun, and are no more. VIII A WHITE LIAR Beautiful, bright deceiver! On your lips are numberless lies; But the truths they slay so lightly Live, above, in their Heaven, your eyes! IX ON LEAVING AN OLD HOUSE In happy June, though we depart, The rose shall climb for ever thus, Hiding the bee within its heart, And in the window look for us. X AT HOME Far-off the sunset-smitten spires Breathe through the wood their golden fires; Hither the noisy city swells A dreamy tide of vesper bells. XI A DEDICATION I give this Book with sacred gratitude, Dear One, to you, so gentle, gracious, good,â Whose high and delicate genius breathes but part Of your pure spirit, sweet person, tender heart.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IN THE OHIO VALLEY THE OLD WOODMAN'S AXE IN KENTUCKY I am the old Woodman's axe. His stalwart arm (The old Backwoodsman Morgan's, his I mean), A bloodless but a mighty conqueror's, Has swung me long, and look what we have wrought: The savage wood, the abode of savage men, Shrill day and night with roaming beasts of prey, Has vanished, shadow-like, with all its shade,â And see, instead, what mighty harvest fields, Where golden tents of Plenty thickly stand; What flower-sweet meadows fragrant-breathed with kine, Or tremulous with bleat of new-dropped lambs; And, look! yon clustered cottage-roofs and spire! JENNY'S WAY TO HONOUR A cablegram from Indianapolis, Indiana, dated May 30, states that Jenny Carey, ten years old, living with her parents at Munksford, has just received the medal of the French Legion of Honour for saving a train on the Panhandle Railway, laden with over seven hundred passengers, bound for the World's Fair at Chicago, last summer. While walking along the line, she discovered that a trestle bridge across a deep ravine was on fire, and had become impassable. She thereupon took off her red flannel petticoat, ran along the track to meet the express then nearly due, and as it came in sight waved her petticoat as a signal of danger, causing the driver to stop the train. Among the passengers were several Frenchmen, who on returning to France brought the child's remarkable action to the notice of President Carnot, with the result mentioned above. AN INTERNATIONAL INCIDENT: PANHANDLE RAILWAY, U. S. A. A wandering child by the railway goes,â Her nameless name now the wide world knows. She sees where the crawling flames of drought Have sapped the bridge with its timbers stout. The trestle bridge o'er the deep ravine Burning, and soon it will fall, she has seen. The World's-Fair Express is rushing near,â Its far-drawn thunder she soon must hear. Seven hundred lives are its priceless freight,â What harvest of Death if her sign be late! But the driver sees her! ... She ran to meet The roaring train with her brown bare feet. Swiftly she hurried along the track, Flagging the flying earthquake back! âDanger before!â The driver saw, While brake and throttle obeyed his law, A little girl waving her petticoat red, Like the Terror-Signal of France, ahead. The long train, shuddering, stood still. (Half-seen In a blur of smoke lay the dread ravine.) Seven hundred lives were its priceless freight,â What harvest of Death were her flag too late! ... Honour to France, that blazons her deed With its highest tribute, the nation's meed! She saved the lives of many,âby chance With these were grateful sons of France. Her Errand of Mercy shines far with fame, ... In the Legion of Honour France writes her name. London, June 1894. THE HARVEST SPRING Blithe birds sing out from branches green Of clustered maples tall, O'er rocky banks whose mosses sheen Show sunward trickles fall. Here, closed in grasses, fringed with flowers, From shadow, glistening In stealthy rays, through sunny hours Flows forth the Harvest Spring. On upland slopes the sultry grain Waves high in noontide warm, Where sunlit sickles gleam again From many a sunburnt arm. Thence oft, when strength ebbs faint in stir Through sweating brow and breast, Comes hither each hot harvester To quench his thirst and rest. Renewed, as if with breath of prime, Soon back to toil they go: Hark, how the striking sickles chime!â See the gold shocks a-row! A WINTER MORNING IDYL Haunting the darkness everywhere, The snow has clothed the moonless air Through the long hush of night; And now with morn the woodlands thrill: Their solitude how bright! how still!â The valley 's blind with light! Warm sunshine through our window sees Illumined towers, illumined trees, That melt in silver gleams, Where the weird Artist of the Night, To give yon child a new delight, Had tried to paint its dreams! The trees with dropping sparkles glisten Beside our door; andâsee them! listen! A score of boys, aglow, Quick-blooded, full of buoyant life, Mingle, knee-deep, in merry strifeâ Mock-battles with the snow! Warming old Winter with their joy, What shouts! what laughter! Yonder boy, A champion lithe and tall, Compels his corps with instant willâ An avalanche charge! But, massed and still, These neither fly nor fall! One little rogue, so cunning-shy, Half-blinds the big boy's laughing eye; With quick-averted face Another throwsâa cap is flying; To 'scape the snow-ball, this one trying Slips in soon-past disgrace! ... Who, smiling, watches eager there? A grey-beardâhoar-frost in his hair, But flower-warmth in his heartâ At yonder window, peering through, Joins in the joyous battle too, His boyhood taking part! TWO WALKS IN AUTUMN I IN NOVEMBER WOODS How drearily the cold rain shakes the boughs (A constant shiver rises everywhere), Washing the gold and crimson glory out From all the enchanted trees! while fitfully fall The dead leaves, one by one, noiseless and slow, Heavily down in paths that were all flowers; Or, when the wet wind fills the solitude, In silent clusters eddy to the ground. Oh, sad and weary, to a weary heart, The endless dying whisper of the rain, And the slow answer of the November wind! ... 'Tis not the wind that flings quick sunny gleams Through the dark, dewy, glad, green leaves of May, To sprinkle flowers among the golden moss; Fresh runner over all the shining fields, Crisping the river's wide and quiet blue, Tangling the long grass round the heifer's bell, Blowing the bees from roses in the sun, And catching the young girl so mirthfully She dreams the sprite her playmate, breaks away, Laughs like a brook, and shakes her happy hair: The Autumnal windâthe death-sigh of the Year!â Among the troubled woods a wanderer lone, Like one who has no friends and walks abroad Through fallen, falling, ever-falling leaves! II AMONG FALLEN LEAVES In the Indian Summer Haze I love to steal my way Through the bright woods, when Autumn's work is done And through the tree-tops all the dream-like day Breathes the soft golden sun; When all is hushed and still, Only a few last leaves, each fluttering slow Down the warm air with ne'er a breeze's willâ A ghost of sound below; When naught of song is heard, Save the jay laughing while all Nature grieves, Or the lone chirp of some forgotten bird Among the fallen leaves. ... Around me everywhere Lie leaves that trembled green the Summer long, Holding the rainbow's tears in sunny air, And roofed the Summer's song. Why shun my steps to tread These silent hosts that everywhere are strown, As if my feet were walking 'mong the dead, And I alive alone? Hast no bright trees, O Past! Through whose bare boughs, once green, the sunshine grieves? No hopes that fluttered in the Autumnal blast, No memoriesâfallen leaves? ODE FOR THE OPENING OF THE MUSIC HALL AT CINCINNATI, The gift of certain leading citizens to the city. MAY FESTIVAL 1878 I For ministries benign, Complete, behold the gracious Temple stands, Whose stately walls full, fortune-sowing hands (Praise for the gift to the large-giving heart!) Have builded in our eager Western mart, Denying Traffic's greed and Mammon's shrine. II To what civic Good or Grace Shall we dedicate the Place? âTo Art and Industry, in friendly strife Brightening and blessing life: To smiling Toil, electric-fingered Skill (Aladdin's light bidding by the huge bondman done, Dream-sandaled, tireless, still): To quick Invention's prompt device, With mechanism airy-nice, That, like the old fireside sprite, Makes the wan maiden's task-work playful-brief, Letting her sleep by night: To all that lathe and loom produce: To Flora's garland, Ceres' sheaf, And every fruit of soil and sun (With the blithe vineyard's temperate juice): To Sculpture's breathless-breathing charm, And Painting's mirror soft and warm: To each fair muse and every household grace: To Use and Beauty bound in oneâ We dedicate the Place! But, first, to her, the Muse of Music, her Whose speech all spirits in earth and heaven know (The native tongue of each far-sundered nation), The loftiest, lowliest human minister, Exalting pleasure, soothing woe,â With heart, and voice, and organ's vast elation, To her shall be its consecration. III From the wide doors of their rapt dwelling-places (Whence ever-newly come their songs below, And whither, hence, they go), Look, what high guests attend our happy rite, With earth-woven wreaths but sphere-enchanted faces,â The Masters of Delight! âFirst he, of the elder days, Whom the great organ owns With its vast-bosomed, earth-shaking, heaven-reaching tones, (Let the proud servant throb his loftiest praise!) Next he, who built the mighty symphonies, One for each muse, who, chaunting joy and peace, Thrills us with awe and yearning infinite, Picturing divine repose, love's world-embracing height! Then he, whose noblest strain Brings Orpheus back to quicken earth again, To conquer darkness and the dread under-powers, Charming lost love from the deep doors of Hell. And lo, the choral master, highest in fame (A thousand voices lift to greet him well), Who breathes sure faith through these frail hearts of ours! And many another well-beloved name, Ay, many another, comes with these, Star-like, with spheral harmonies:â Welcome each and all, To our festal Hall; Long be its music-lifted dome For their abiding souls the transient home. IV Hark! as if the morning-stars were singing O'er the first glad Six Days' Task divineâ What rapturous sounds are these Of quickening ecstasies! Earth, from her dark spell-bound slumber breaking, To the sun's far-journeyed kiss awaking, Lo, the blissful palpitation Of the newly-warmed creation! With a myriad mingling voices All the electric air rejoices; All about, beneath, above, Rings the tender note of love; Everywhere, around are heard Fountain-laughter, song of bird, Insect-murmur, wild-bee's hum, Bleat of flock and low of kine;â Airs of new-born Eden bringing, With her lilting, light-heart lay, Dancing, singing, May is come!â Open doors and let in May! Let Nature's full delight Join with our banded joy, and crown our gracious rite! V To this fair civic Hall, Year after year, New multitudes in many another May Shall throng, repeating the bright festival We celebrate to-day, With happy rites to peace and culture dear; Nor absent be our city's Patron then, In spirit, nor absent nowâ Commending loftier-lowlier ways, The still, clear plainness of heroic days: He after whom the founders, putting by Swords wherewith late their sacred rights were won (Associates they and friends of Washington), And, building here in the fierce wilderness, Beneath the Indian sky, The home we love and ask of Heaven to bless, Called it for him, the soldier-citizen, The Roman at his plough! TO A LONELY WOODLAND SPRING Pure dweller in the shadows green, Glad hermit of the solitude, Whose lovely work is wrought unseen For ever in the pathless wood! Like thine I wish my task might be:â With the shy fountain's lonely birth In Nature's close society, But sending beauty through the earth. Such is the poet's life: a stream From his heart rising ever steals, Wreathing bare use with beauty's gleam, A rainbow on the busy wheels! AN EPITAPH B. M. P. Near his loved home, among familiar flowers (Whose memories mingle fragrant breath with ours), Sleeps a grey father of the mighty West. His hands had Nature's plea for folded rest; For, through long years and manhood's noble strife, Whitened his head above his golden life. He passed as one who from his harvest goes, Attended by the sun, to his reposeâ Gracious and good. Behold his simple fame: He lies asleep beneath his honoured name. ON THE OLD FRONTIER LINE THE SUMMIT OF THE ALLEGHANIES What eager looks before, and sad behind! That wingÃ©d Pioneer of pioneers, Quick Hope, whose eyes reflect unrisen suns, For those far-off alights and beckons on; For these, the Angel with reverted face, Memory, to whom the Past returns in tears, Walks back through dusky gates of Long Ago.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CLIO IN THE CAPITOL, ETC. CLIO IN THE CAPITOL SEEN AT SUNSET FROM THE LIBRARY WINDOW OPPOSITE [Franzoni's Clock, with the marble sculpture of the Muse of History, Clio, listening and writing, upon a winged chariotâone wheel of which, supported by the hemisphere of a globe, is the clock-faceâstands over the northern entrance of the Old Hall of Representatives, now assigned for the statues and portraits of our great public men at Washington. Through the centre of this Old Hall is the passage from the Rotunda of the Capitol toward the present Hall of Representatives.] Here, looking down, I see her Grecian grace, With the still halo of the last, low ray, Motionless, beautiful, in the Sacred Place, While the late-jarring footstep floats away. Lo, on the wingÃ©d chariot where she stands!â (Its hurrying wheel notes the quick hour's hushed flight, The half-globe beneath it)âin her patient hands The open book, the pen applied to write! In the Old Hall the men have changed to ghosts Whom erst she markedâwho marked her not, perchance,â And there below, for those long-vanished hosts, Show marble shape and pictured countenance. Daily across yon floor, long since so loud With partial schemes and strifes of public breath, To the New Hall new-jostling statesmen crowd Through that White Congress of undying death. Men of the Past! your word her pages showâ She heard, she saw, she knew you there, indeed! Oh, ye New-Comers, eddying to and fro, Behold the still Recorder and take heed! There she remains, with listening face and pen Ready to give the patriot's deathless dower: Look!âliving, speaking, acting, passing men!â The Eternal Present on her Flying Hour! TRANSFIGURATION CHARLESTOWN, VA., DECEMBER 2, 1859 WASHINGTON, D. C., DECEMBER 2, 1863 It was remarked as a suggestive coincidence, that Crawford's Statue of Freedom (the work of putting which in bronze was said to have been done by negroes who were, or had been, slaves in the employment of Clark Mills, another sculptor) was raised to its position on the dome of the National Capitol at Washington on the anniversary of the execution of John Brown at Charlestown, Virginia, four years previous, and at the same hour of the day. Four years ago the Saviour of the Slave Took in his strong, brave arms a slave-born childâ Ere from the gallows to the martyr's grave He passedâwith manly blessing, deep and mild. O Land, however strong, too weak to do Such office then! Like Christopher of old, In that poor child the lifted Christ he knew, The great Bond-Breaker in his human hold! O humbled Nation! To thy proudest place Thou liftest yonder Shape of Freedom now, Where Morning shall be quick to see her face, And Eve to touch with dew her sacred brow! But he who seeks the soul within the form In that bright shape shall see another sight: A grey old man, holding, in calm or storm, The unfettered child forever in the light! THE END OF THE JOURNEY Written by request for the occasion of General Grant's reception at Philadelphia on his return from travel around the world. It may be recalled that General Grant was doubtless the first man so distinguished personally and as the recognised representative of a great country, who, under circumstances made possible by the telegraph, railway, steamship, and modern newspaper, ever made a journey around the world. Our new-plucked flowers to the world's full garland, friends!â At home, with all best paths, his long Path ends. Oh, such a Path no man e'er went before, Earth-smiting king, or patriot conqueror! The sun's long pathâthe path it ever came World-lighting, this his Pathway lit by fame. Far toward its native East the sun's great way He went, with some new land each new-risen day. At each land's threshold, as he crossed it, kings, Warriors, and statesmen gave him welcomings. Crowned princes met him crownless, awed to see In this still man the Great Land's Majesty; O'er lands, o'er seas, they saw, through him confest, The Banded Stars that quicken all the West. A hero's honours?âyes, a hero's, too: But in the man the Many-in-One they knew. The sun's long pathâthe path it ever came World-lighting, this is Pathway lit by fame. Toward the sun's native East, till the East was West, And the sun rose across the roofs loved best! âHark, with the cannon's thunder, âHe is come,â Mingle the martial trumpet, quickening drum,â A warrior's welcome! ... Let the war-sound cease; The warrior's welcome now be rest and peace. The laurel, meed of mighty conqueror, Edmund Spenser. Long since we proudly gave, he justly wore. Put up the sword, well-sheathed; upon the wall The bow unstrung leave, wind-swayed, in the hall. Long may he live, unvexed by clamorous cares, Breathed on by blessing of home-breathing airs,â Live long, grow old, like him our First of Men, Or that plain Roman soldier-citizen. Our new-plucked flowers to the world's full garland, friends!â At home, with all best paths, his long Path ends. THE BOYS IN BLUE A great political demonstration of the Grand Army of the Republicâcomposed of surviving officers and men of the Union Armyâat Cincinnati, a few nights before, and in favour of, the election of General Garfield as President of the United States of America. TWO PROCESSIONS Garfield, not only these do vote for you,â Not only these, survivors tried and true, Vote as they fought, the loyal Boys in Blue: Not only these, who bore through shot and shell The flag whose tatters keep their story well (New hands upheld it when the old bearers fell). Another mighty host comes marching slow From their long bivouacs in the grass and snowâ By these they fought and suffered long ago. Through every street they march with silent tread, (Quicken the living, ye the Living Dead!)â Look, the same tattered flag is overhead! What captains lead them!ânames well-kept as won. (Lincoln looks down, as often he has done, To see their marching-past, at Washington: He votes with them and these.)âThe tried and true, They vote; the dead, as living, vote for you,â Vote, Garfield, as they fought, the Boys in Blue!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MISCELLANEOUS THE YELLOW LEAF IN THE POET'S BOOK I âWhisper, Yellow Leaf, to me Thy forgotten history.â âOne far Spring-time, green and young, On a sunny bough we hung. âBlithest of green leaves were we, Fluttering glad on the green tree. âMerrily fairy moonbeams played, Dancing through our dancing shade. âDecked with Morn's gay jewellery, Full of singing birds were we. âThrough the May and through the June We danced every light wind's tune. âAsk not where my kin are flownâ I am old and here alone. âTheir far Summer-time was brief:â I am here, a Yellow Leaf. âSunbeams grew chill and winds grew wildâ Kiss the Summer's orphan child!â II âWhisper, Yellow Leaf, to me Why the Poet treasures thee.â âThat far Spring, when I was young, In our shade a maiden sung. âAnd his life, a blossoming tree, Danced with leaves as glad as we. âBut those happy leaves at last Fluttered, falling, to the Past. âSee his song along with me, Yellow Leaf of Memory. âBookmarks of his life we lie, Brother-leaves, the song and I. âSong and leaf, from that far Spring Dreams of joy and woe we bring. âLet the Poet's song be sungâ I again am green and young; âLook, the maiden sings below!â Sun-leafed shadows wreathe her brow. âSummer-time and Love were briefâ Love the Poet's Yellow Leaf!â THE WINDOW-MIRACLE It blossomed here on the window, All the long still winter night, While the earth in moonshine slumbered With face upturned and bright. It blossomed here on the window, The phantom-summer of Frost, With trees and flowers and foliageâ All loveliness that is lost. The children, awakened at dawning, Stand gazing with hushed delight; They see, with sight beyond seeing, This miracle of the Night! THE MINER'S BETROTHAL The story is told of a young miner, somewhere in the North of Europe, whose body was found, fifty years after his death by the falling-in of a mine, preserved life-like by some chemical property in the earth, and was recognised only by the faithful woman, grown old and withered, to whom he had been betrothed. I The miner kissed his maiden bride. âUpon St. Lucia's Day, Their blessing on our lives, fast-bound, the priestly palms shall lay; Then we will build our summer nest in sunny trees together, Where Peace and Love, like mated birds, shall make their happy weather.â Yesterday came the Sabbath, when,âoh, brightly everywhere!â The Earth was wreathed divinely with the heavenly halo-air; And in the village-chapel, for the second time proclaimed, The holy banns were spoken, and the wedding-day was named. âGood-morning,â at her window now he greets her, going by Down to the midnight mine all dayâher smile 's her bright reply: âGood-morning,â in his heart it beats, while light of foot and fast From her sweet sight he vanished ... far away into the Past! II Glad-hearted plays her needle, and her work is made of song; Fancies, at loving work for Love, lighten slow Time along. Slowly the morning dies, and slow the evening hours depart, And in her cheek the roses climbâtheir fragrance fills her heart. III Fifty long years of happy Junes and dreary, cold Decembers! Fifty long years of smiles and tearsâbright firesides, dying embers! Fifty long years, on what strange shores have crawled their broken waves!â How far away their echoes dead drop down in Memory's caves! Old crowns from dust gleam, buried, and old sceptres are forgot; Old prisons, earthquake-shaken lowâtheir woes remembered not; Grey, giant slumberers have awaked with blindness in their eyes; The West has rounded toward the East more manly destinies. The American and French Revolutions had meanwhile taken place. IV Some miners toil within a mine, one morning bright and fair, In olden excavations deep below that morning air; When lo! a dreamer lying there asleep in youth divine;â And with his dream about him, now they bring him from the mine! No one remembers, seeing him. None knows him. Who is he?â Lying in his long trance alone, a man of mystery? Full of the love-dream long ago, he seems a dreamer now: Yesterday's kiss is in his heart, this morning's on his brow! They are all gone, they are all gone, the close familiar faces; Old footsteps falter far away, old echoes lose their places; No father, no mother, no brother steals among that crowd to see And find his lost face in their hearts, a buried memory. But who is she that comes, her hands long weary with their part? ... From the old coffin of her love he wakens in her heart! Love, only sleeping there like him, leaps up as quick and young, As when the dews of the far days to Maying roses clung. Her eyes unblinded by the years of patient-waiting pain, She claims him for her own, long-lost; she clasps him back again: To a true heart she clasps him back; her wrinkled features trace Life's paths of sorrow fifty yearsâDeath has not seen his face! âGood-morning,â long ago he said; he comes to say âGood-even.â Love that has lived so long on earth has moulted wings for heaven. A few more days, the appointed time, the blessing One shall say; She knows her fixed betrothal, and she waits the wedding-day. âCLOSED IN MY POET'S BOOK, I SEEâ Closed in my poet's book, I see The flowers your sweet hand gave to me. All lovely things are there, I deem, That haunt the poet's waking dream, Whose gentle company they keep All night, all dayâawake, asleep; Yet, pity them, they scarce can rest (Ah, first you wore them on your breast!) But, wistful, evermore they look, Whene'er I ope their prisoning book, And, cheated, takeâa moment's spaceâ Their gaoler's for their angel's face; Then, sere and and withering, only miss The resurrection of your kiss. HOME-BELLS IN THE DESERT FROM AN INCIDENT DESCRIBED IN KINGLAKE'S âEOTHEN.â Sweet Sabbath morn! The summer breeze With English sunshine fills the trees About the church-tower old, Whose bells o'erflow the vale and steal Through green, deep lanes, with gentle peal, To many a home's dear fold. ... Through the dead sand, the boundless glare, The blinding silence everywhere, (He veiled from that fierce flame,) They reached a wanderer's dream; awake, Those bells the awe-filled silence breakâ He hears them yet the same! Enchantment! May a mother's prayer Have breathed these wondrous travellers thereâ Far chimes of mother-landâ To call her wanderer's worship home? Oh, softly clear and close they come, With Sabbath, o'er the sand! Or may some flying dream have sent Through Memory's passive instrument A breath those chimes to start, That, vibrant in the sunshine still, The desert air with music fill, And echo in his heart? He knows not, but, dream-like, he sees That church-tower old, its clustered trees, In far familiar air:â 'Tis Sabbath morn in mother-land: Those home-bells make, through the hot sand, Their gentle visit there! What blissful vision he perceives!â Through sunny liftings of the leaves, White gleams and faces known: Dear church-paths old: and one glad door Opensâits rose's fragrance o'er The desert's breath has blown! THE DAYS OF THE WEEK Daughters of God, sweet Days, ye well beseem! Bright are your feet on the high morning shore, And, going back to Heaven forevermore Through golden gates of twilight hush and dream, Your footsteps in the dews of evening shine. A radiant garland round the burning throne, Guarded by holy wingsâa heavenly zoneâ Fair are ye all, bearing the Light Divine. Yet fairest is she, the youngest of your name, In her pure garment of translucent white, And wearing on her head the halo-light Brightening till all things near her wear the same: For, though God loves ye all, when ye are blessed His Hand lies on thy brow, glad Day of Rest! A CHILD'S FACE A PHOTOGRAPH It is the picture of a little child: In the great Babel's roarâhe hears it not: In the great Babel's pressâhe sees it not. His mother stoops beside him, and her arm Caresses him in silence, near her heart. ... âSometime an old man shall be gazing at thee, Sweet Wonder of the world and Wonderer sweet! And, while his dim blue eyes are fixed on thine, Like a tired pilgrim at the close of day Who finds some pillow Nature smoothed for him Of wayside moss and sinks to happy rest, Unconsciously a dream, shall pass to theeâ Sweet eyes and hair whose every thread is gold! Then, looking up to find that mother's face, He shall be grey, the pilgrim weighed with years, Weary with the long harvest of the world. ... 'Tis but a dream wherein the child grows old: 'Tis but a dream makes the old man a child. FROM THE WINDOW OF A GREAT LIBRARY âThe dead alive and busyââ HENRY VAUGHAN Without, wind-lifted, look, a little rose, (From the great Summer's heart its life-blood flows,) For some fond spirit to reach and kiss and bless, Climbs to the casement, brings the lovely wraith Of the sun's quick-blooded world of joyousness Into this still world of enchanted breath! And, far away, behold the dust arise From streets white-hot into the sunny skies! The city murmurs: in the sunshine beats, Through all its giant veins of throbbing streets, The heart of Business, on whose sweltering brow The dew shall sleep to-nightâforgotten now. There rush the many, toiling as but one: There swarm the hiving myriads in the sun: There all the mighty troubled day is loud (Business the god whose voice is of the crowd): And, far above the sea-horizon blue, Like sea-birds, sails are hovering into view. There move the living: here the dead that move: (In the still book-world rests the noiseless lever That moves the noisy throngÃ¨d world forever:) Below the living move: the dead, above. A LOST KINGDOM OF GODS A FRAGMENT The vast Olympian Heaven vanishes Like the frail wreck of clouds that travel slow After a thunder-storm, when eastward far They sink, forever fainter, lower, down In evening dusk among dark mountain peaks, With vague unpurposed thunders, nerveless bolts Of dull forgetful lightnings; and its King, Who made an earthquake if he bent his brows, Goes with his kind in half-forgotten dreams, Such as we dream, and, waking, find are naught, But feel their nothing breathe in all the air. TO THE MONTH OF MARCH WRITTEN ON MY BIRTHDAY My life's first light thine own did bring, (Have I not shown myself thy child?) Month of the blue-bird, nurse of Springâ Fierce, stormy, gay, capricious, mild! When thou didst come and bear me, lo! The lion came in, untamed and strong; My earliest footprint was in snow; Allusion to the observance of some little household superstition. Cold winds sang my first nursery song. The lion, come in, goes out the lamb:â So may I, Mother, when life is past, In green Spring pastures, sweet and calm, With thy soft going, go at last. A DREAM OF CHURCH-WINDOWS Reddening the woodlands dumb and hoary, Bleak with long November winds and rains, Lo, at sunset breathes a sudden gloryâ Breaks a fire on all the Western panes! Eastward far I see the restless splendour Shine through many a window-lattice bright; Nearer all the farmhouse gables render Flame for flame, and shiver in breathless light. Many a mansion, many a cottage lowly, Lost in radiance, palpitates the same At the touch of beauty, strange and holy, All transfigured in the evening flame. Flutters everything with mystic being, Rarer life than ever breathed before; By the alchemy of clearer seeing, Golden lie the shadowsâdark no more. ... Far away beyond the Eastern ocean, Dreaming here at sunset I behold, With a restless palpitating motion, Great cathedral windows burn with gold: High cathedral windows hushed in glory, Where the gorgeous priest of Time is Art,â Blazoned miracles of marvellous story, Deep in many an olden city's heart. And I dream that in their inner splendour Saints and martyrs shine in ancient fire, While above, in twilight dusk and tender, Angels whiten with divine desire. All the air is peopled with a vision: Seraphs breathe their breath of music there; Men who made their lives a holy mission Show their souls in marble everywhere. But, within, some stranger's heart is haunted With the faiths of homelier altars bright, Saints in dearer window-glow enchanted, Till his face is dark with saddened light. And he sees in dream the woodlands hoary, Bleak with long November winds and rains, Reddened while the level sunset glory Floats on all the Western window-panes: See, as I do, while the phantom splendid Of those gorgeous windows passes bright, And the radiance, which my dream attended, Slowly fades and falters into night: While abroad the bare and dumb November Ghost-like stands amid the crimson haze, And the glimmering casements scarce remember, Ghost-like now in gloom, the sunset blaze:â Sees a sudden, newer, dearer splendour Issue from a thousand windows warm, Where the children crowd with faces tender, Guarded by the fireside's sacred charm. ... Shut without the twilight's dusk reflection, With the ghosts that walk the Autumnal night,â Wife and mother, with divine affection, Stand within the Western window-light. A DYING YEAR As when upon some mighty battle-plain The King has fallen and all his army knows One common thrill goes through the myriad heart For there he lies, breathing last breaths away, So dear, so dear to all, he seems to lean His sunken head on every soldier's breast: So the Year dies; so, dying, seems to leave His fallen head upon the heart of all. THE FISHERMAN'S LIGHTHOUSE A picture in my mind I keep, While all without is shiver of rain;â Warm firelit shapes, forgotten, creep Away, and shadows fill my brain. I see a chill and desolate bay, That glimmers into a lonely wood, Till, darkling more and more away, It glooms an empty solitude. No cheerful sound afar to hear, No cheerful sight afar to see;â The stars are shut in heavens drear, The darkness holds the world and me. Yet, hark!âI hear a quickening oar, The burden of a happy song, That echo keeps along the shore In faint-repeating chorus long. And whither moves he through the night, The rower of my twilight dream?â A compass in his heart is bright, And all his pathway is a gleam! No lighthouse leaning from the rock, To tell the sea-tossed mariner Where breakers, fiercely-gathering, shock A fiery-speaking messenger! But see, o'er water lighted far, One steadfast line of splendour come!â Is it in heaven the evening star? The fisher knows his light at home! And which is brighterâthat which glows His evening star of faith and rest, Or that which, sudden-kindled, goes To meet it from his eager breast? TWO MOODS OF OCTOBER A hermit in the woodland (lo, An empty nest in withered hands!) Who counts, bead-like, the leaves that fall, Sometimes October stands; Sometimes, a joyous harvester In sun-browned fields of blowing grain, He laughs and shouts with children blithe, Who laugh and shout again! MISTRESS OF THE RING INSCRIBED TO A BRIDE Ah, little ring of gold!âall one, Two lives are in its tender power; Two morning paths together flower, Two hearts beat toward the westering sun. ... On the sweet band was laid a charm: Whoe'er its golden orb should wear, Her years unblighted May should bear, With Love to guard her close and warm. The spell-wrought bond should fold within That circle of the enchanter's might All gentle spirits of joy and lightâ The dawn-touched Eden pure of sin. Clasped in its sacred round should glow The gracious atmosphere of Home, Whose angels each from Heaven should come And, vanishing, to Heaven should go. Held safe in that enchanted air, How fair to her and how serene The storm-dark world should still be seen Beneath the rainbow lighted there! All fortunes should by her be won:â Their myrtle and cypress deathless friends, Years, many as Heaven for blessing sends, Bright as to earth Heaven gives the sun. This was the precious spell. Behold (So may its working follow true), I set its charm in words for youâ See on your hand that spell-bound gold! A CANDLE'S LIGHT ON THE STUDENT'S LIBRARY TABLE O humble and yet bright! Making thy sacrifice so noiselessly,â Burning thy lovely life away, to light Diviner light for me! In my hushed room around, In thy wise circle, come the Great and Good: Masters of men yet servants, without sound They visit my solitude. Holy and high they shine, Rapt faces, charming me with courage on To follow steadfast on some path divine Through darkness into dawn. The scholar's lonely sun, Thou risest for him, when all the world repose, O'er golden fields of thought, where, fortunate one He reaps even while he sows! ... Within my soul, deep down, I read a lesson by thy sinking flame: To wear a humble purpose like a crown With no regard of fame: Like frankincense to burn Unnoted life that man may see to read Diviner wordsâthough asking no return, A candle for his need! THE RING OF FASTRADA The little ring your hand doth show Is the same ring Fastrada wore, Wife of the Great Charles, long agoâ Whose charm could bind him evermore. O dearest, gentlest, sweetest, best! Whose eyes of starry tenderness So many happy years have blessed, So many more I pray shall bless: The world-old Magic-Master brought You the same ringâif not the same, The self-same charm in this he wrought Which gave to that romantic fame. TO NIGHT, THE HEALER Soon as the battle's roar sinks low, Thy ministers with tender arms Into the hushing battle steal, With balms and loving charms. The wounded, lying in their pain, (The dying, soon their wounds are healed!) They give the enchanted cup, and bear Far from the fevered field: Where rise the souls of brook and bird, Where roses clamber to their dreams From gardens of forgotten dew In far auroral gleams. Thy spirits o'er their couches still Wear shapes and features treasured fast; The angels of the Present seem The angels of the Past! The morning finds them on the ground, They waken in the eager field. ... They were not wounded! Look, again They grasp the sword and shield! THE COMING-FORTH OF STARS AT MIDSUMMER EVENING Hark, out of all the neighbouring forest hum The mingled voices of a myriad things, A sound that half is silence listening)â Birds, insects loud with summer, brooks that creep, How through the dark and flutter into the light, As if with prisoned wings,) then hurry on; And the light, lazy turning evermore Of restless leaves unnumbered, half-asleep And yet unsleeping. These, while twilight draws Great dewy veils in silence over all, Breathe my old indolence a newer spell, Till, all forgetful of the hour, I see, Winking above a western cloud, the star Beloved by loversâhers the lover's friend,â And, underneath the boughs and far and near, The fireflies climbing into dusky air, Lifting their million stars from grass and weed Wet with the dew; meanwhile, the stars on high Start, one by oneâfrom cells invisible,â Visible in the darkness suddenly, Contemporaries of the dreamy hour. Oh, dear to me the coming-forth of stars! After the trivial tumults of the day They fill the heaven, they hush the earth with awe And, when my life is fretted overmuch With transient nothings, it is good, I deem, From darkling windows to look forth and gaze At this new blossoming of Eternity 'Twixt each to-morrow and each dead to-day; Or else, with solemn footsteps modulate To spheral music, wander forth and know Their radiant individualities, And feel their presence newly; hear again The silence that is God's voice speaking, slow In starry syllables, forevermore. HIS DREAM OF HER IN ABSENCE Was it a blissful dream I dreamed, Or Fancy's sleepless make-belief? She cameâoh, was she here or seemed?â A gentle vision brief: And, like a rose-tree over me, She kissed, she clasped me tenderly. Was it a blissful dream I dreamed, Or Fancy's sleepless make-belief? She cameâoh, was she here or seemed?â A happy vision brief: And bent, caressing and caressed, A moment's heaven upon my breast. It was a blissful dream I dreamed, Or Fancy's sleepless make-belief: She cameâshe was not here but seemedâ A flying vision brief. O soft and vanished dreamâdespair Of solitude and empty air! IN FAIR AND FOUL WEATHER Ah the Beautiful Weather!âwithin it is done Whatever shall open a door for the sun: The deeds of the heroes whose heraldry lies In the hearts whose warm prayers write themâup in the skies. What good gifts are given, what kind words are spoken When the blue, through the cloud, of Fair Weather gives token! ... Lo, a black host arises, a gloom closes round, Like the Pit's darkness visible breathed above ground;â Fierce homicides, were-wolves, babe-smotherers, (hark, What sighs, shrieks and groans eddy by in the dark!) With all doers of deeds without name, all together, Pell-mell, worthy hell, troop the fiends of Foul Weather! AN ANGEL WITH A BROOM IN THE HOUSE BEAUTIFUL A Dutch Picture Asleep, I had a dream: Awake, as it did seem,â While the gold-breathing dawn Lit dewy lane and lawn Without, and on my wall, Within, rose-light did fall,â I saw there in my room An Angel with a Broom. Careful, from side to side, Her gentle task she plied; Motes, risen as slant rays streamed, A mist of cherubs seemed: These, like a halo, wore That Sweeper of my floor. âThen I awoke in sooth To know the happy truth How Love, with holy Duty, Gives Use its heavenly beauty. I saw within my room An Angel with a Broom: âPray, what is it you do?â âI keep this House for you.â</field>
