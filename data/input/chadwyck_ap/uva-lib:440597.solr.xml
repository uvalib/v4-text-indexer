      <field name="fulltext">1. The Times The Times in this old beldame earth, Of trial, trouble, and vexation; Have been the subject, and the birth; Of many a tiresome conversation. When I was young the times were bad; And desp'rate bad each person says: (And oft I heard that cry so sad) That money's money now a days. When I was more observant grown (I think I heard somebody say) Such times as these were never known And money's money every day. Now I am older; grown more wise; And things yet keep in their old ways, This Truth I think around us flies; There is no money now a days. Steubenville 1819 2. Fancy How vainly weak is language to express Th' harmonious beauty of her heavenly song The azure brightness of the summer sky As true as pictur'd on the muddy stream As are the soul-enchanting lays I heard Told by my feeble tongue to mortal ears— “O Why,” I cried—“thou wand'ring bashful Maid Fliest thou to wilds and solitudes like these Come with me come to the cheerful haunts of men And breath to them thy rich delighting strains.” “No,” she replied, “no list'ning ear but thine Will think my voice my harp's wild notes are sweet Amidst the din of the tumultuous world My loudest voice would rise unheard, unknown, And with my sweetest notes foul Criticism Might join its fiendish screech. And Envy's breath Might change each string upon my Silver Harp To hideous snakes hissing strange discord— O tempt me not to seek the praise of men But rather stray with me through Nature's wilds Thou lov'st me as thy life then wherefore risk Thy happiness. E'en from thy life's first dawn Until this hour have we not partners been Through joy and grief. And I will bless thee still Thou over arid plains thou wind thy way Oer flinty paths and barren wilderness Still to my magic touch the flow'rs shall spring And spread a carpet for thy weary feet— The blackest mountain I will gild for thee And light the ocean in the darkest night Where'er thou strayest I will cheer thy path And with my voice will bless thy loveliest hour Yes while thy spirit wanders upon earth With thee unceasing dwell for am I not Thine own thy long lov'd dearly cherish'd Fancy.” Thomas Cole 1825 3. The Vision of Life High on the swift and stayless wing of Time Traversing free infinity's dim space For years I slept and dreamed; but one day called By some mysterious spirit I awoke— Thus spoke the voice: “Rouse thee and look around What dost thou see—below—before—behind?” I rose unwillingly from my place of rest And looked below—it was a desolate scene That met my eye—Bare rocks and rugged hills And black pools and furious cataracts— Castles there were tattering in ruin Gardens laid out with the intent to beauty; But left unfinished, and nought but weeds And plants pale in the poisoned sickliness Could vegetate in that accursed soil— From the drear scene I turned in pain away And looked before: there shadowy fogs were spread And a black night was brooding o'er the land; But through the gloom an ignus fatuus sped And threw its light in fitful flickerings, On any forms that sprung as if from Chaos, Ever changeful; and at times they took bright forms As palaces of clustered gems and gold That shone in sunny splendor on the clouds Vast rolling far beneath and fountains pure Mid quiet groves gushed as with living light— And e'en the music of their warbling came Soft on the breeze—Anon some evil power Those gorgeous scenes transformed, into the dark, Dank, slimy haunt of serpents and of green dragons— And then from deep and sulphury caverns burst The dinful howl of demons ever torturing And forever tortured—“Spirit,” I cried: “Let me not gaze on such soul sickening sights As these”—“Turn then behind thy wearied eye.” Eager I gazed—What heavenly scenes were there! Over the rocks, the rugged barren hills, The deep black pools, the furious cataracts, Distance had spread a veil of tender beauty; And the drear, desolate wild, that we had passed— Retiring grew more lovely ere 'twas lost— “Is this my destined lot,” I sighing said, “thou spirit Ne'er to find joy, but in the fading past? Bliss sicklied with regret”—The spirit spoke again But faint and brokenly: and much escaped My lingering ear—“another state of being” “Eternity”—“good, evil”—“woe and bliss” Were all I gathered more. 1825 4. To the Moon Hail thou fair orb! Thou ever beauteous light Thou di'mond in the subtle robe of night Plac'd by thy maker in the wilds of space, And bade pursue unceasingly thy race. In heav'n's blue canopy thy torch was hung (When the bright angels first creation sung.) To cheer this earth when in the Ocean's breast The wearied sun hath plunged his golden crest— Emblem of mercy: whose descending beams Impartial spread wide o'er the trackless wild The fertile valley, and the sparkling deep The palace, cot, the wood entangled steep. O what a subject, what a swelling theme For mind's wide scope, or fancy's airy dream, To trace enamoured on thy bosom bright, The rising mountains, or the ocean's light— Thou hast thy hills rejoicing in the day Thy rivers roll their ever changeful way. High to the sun thy threat'ning rocks arise: And vallies dim my eager fancy spies: Thy woods are dark—and shall I venture more, And dare thy hidden secrets to explore; Are there not beings form'd to grace the rest Happy, and beautiful, divinely bless'd Pure as their skies more virtuous than we; Who never fell from heaven's high destiny— On the Atlantic's undulating breast, Thy pictur'd image by the flood is press'd; Methinks thy searching beams can sweep Into the very caverns of the deep— Through liquid mazes troublous, and dread, Lighting the gloom of Ocean's rocky bed. Perhaps in some coral grove, or weedy vale To her he loves the Merman breathes his tale; In liquid language he recites it o'er, With voice like waves upon the pebbly shore Swears that his love is boundless as the sea, Pure as that orb, and turning points to thee— O let me wander in my silent beam, When all is calm, and still, and e'en the stream Rolls on in silence: when the breezes sleep Or sigh in softness o'er the smiling deep— And ye deep woods rise to this silver light, Heave your broad bosoms toss your branches bright. And ye blue mountains climbing to the sky Thou ocean wide: ye beaming clouds on high; The Moon's fair light in bright reflections raise And greet the heav'ns with your grateful praise, Thou light of heaven; who of thee can sing, Render thy praise, or worthy off'rings bring: Feeble my efforts but do thou receive, This humble tribute glorious Queen of eve— T Cole 1825 5. Twilight The woods are dark; but yet the lingering light Spreads its last beauty o'er the sunset sky. How lovely are the portals of the night When stars come forth to watch the daylight die! The woods are dark; but yet yon little bird Is warbling by his newly furnished nest. No sound beside in all the vale is heard; But he for rapture cannot—cannot rest. [1825] [6. The night was calm. Clad in her mantle darkness] The night was calm. Clad in her mantle darkness Nature rested. Through Contemplation's Courts Ubiquitous: unconsciously I stray'd The free thoughts came: the quickly attending Nymphs Through the uncounted gates of her vast Halls Into my presence told their tales and vanish'd; One form rose more welcome than the rest: Long had I lov'd and sought th' bewitching Maid— Like the light mist call'd by the rising sun To stretch its wreathy pinions and to mount In exaultation o'er the sluggish world; To spread its silver hair and to toss Its snowy arms in the Cerulean Wilds, The poet's eye may gaze in ecstacy And Beauty's pow'r may kindle up his heart, But never can his feeble pen pourtray The changeful contour of the fleeting Cloud— So rose the Nymph before my raptur'd eye, In all her beauty undefinable— To me she spoke but not as mortals speak; Words are their signs few they are and pow'rless But from her lips flow'd Ideas clear and full; And when her silver Harp she took and sung And touch'd those strings tun'd in the Choir of Heaven Each swelling Note rung through my echoing heart— She sweetly smiled and had me follow her Into a forest's shade more dark and still Than the deep cave where single silence dwells— Here her clear voice pour'd a melodious lay Harmonious, solemn, and majestic; The list'ning trees bent through the murky gloom And wav'd their branches to the pow'rful song. And when she ceas'd, answering voices came Loud at first they were but fainter sank, Then softly whisper'd as from tree to tree They wandered as unwilling to depart From these retir'd umbrageous retreats— Now from the groves we hied and soon I saw The idle River slowly roll along, And on its gentle glassy surface dwelt Reflected objects beautifully soft E'en the little stars that spring like flow'rs, Gaily deck the distant fields of Heav'n, Did twinkle there as bright as in the sky— And when the mellow notes reach'd the flood How the waters smil'd and bore their burthen To the farthest shore— Now to the deep and narrow vale we sped, Cleft by some earthquake in the mountain's side From the deep Chasm the mossy wall arose And nodding rocks bent o'er the yawning gulf And form'd an Arch from whose gray central stone Countless greedy years had suck'd the strength away. And now it hung suspended o'er the depth. In dreadful poise like to a little world Swung by a thread to utmost tension stretch'd Through the black womb of unencompass'd space— In murmuring sounds she first began And the soft music kiss'd in wanton glee The bare shapeless rocks and in the cliffs Worn by the trickling stream they playful lurk'd And mocking lisp'd and lisp'd again again— But now the voice arose in louder swells The rude rock trembled and the little fragments Drop't from the steeps yet, and yet, it mounted A mighty crash was heard and the huge Arch That tow'r'd so high lay crumbled at my feet— Now up a mountain's dangerous steep we sprung With mountain speed as swift as though we strode Upon the rushing blast that flew tow'rds Heav'n, The mountain's airy summit soon we gain'd And stood unwearied on its topmost cliff— Around us spread a rich and varied feast For the unsated eye—Over our heads The Heav'ns' blue Curtain hung without a cloud Faint and far off upon the reckless Wave The dim horizon lay—The emblem fit Of vague Futurity. So far we see But all beyond is darkness doubt and fear— On the Ocean's breast numerous islands lay Like gems upon an azure banner spread Nearer the dark brown woods, wav'd to the sky And mighty Streams grasp'd in their Giant arms The prostrate Earth—There the beauteous Nymph Rais'd high her Harp and called the slumb'ring Winds Th' attentive Breezes heard wak'd from their sleep And sigh'd in softness o'er the sparkling flood Augmenting. Soon a noisy blast began To whistle rudely round the mountain top The tall grass bound before the rushing wind Hiding their heads the flowers stoop'd for shelter The careless gale caught up the Maiden's hair And swept it rudely o'er the troubled strings— To the blue Heav'ns' interminable voids Her glitt'ring Harp in silence mute she raised Tow'rds the Abyss where formless Nothing dwells Where echoes never lisp though Angels shout— Again the slumb'ring notes were roused up As o'er the clear Concave she swung the Harp Millions! Millions! of stars did smile in light And shone upon the wand'ring Instrument. But when the deep red Shield of bloody Mars Approach'd its edge oft from his fiery eye She snatch'd it quick. To him she never sung For he presides o'er gushing Blood and War— But oft she wept in silence as she mus'd The Soldier's fall and saw his Glory's Plume Dyed in his own warm gushing precious blood— And heard the Widow sigh in loneliness The Orphan's wail in the Winter's blast They rais'd their cry bereav'd and unprotected, For in the field of War their sire was slain; And cruel grief had rent their Mother's heart And set her spirit free to rise to Heav'n— In chasing streams I saw the Maiden's tears Dash'd on the rocks like broken diamonds. She rais'd her head, but still a lucent drop Clung to her long eyelash as though it fear'd To venture from its lov'd and secret Cell— A rosy blush now sped across her cheek And Lo! I saw betwixt the trembling Strings Fair Venus beam'd! and in enrapturing lays Were Love and Beauty sung; first Beauty blaz'd Then lit the torch of Love. The Music's pow'r Pour'd a rich stream which circles round my heart And rising fill'd the cistern of my soul Up to the brim. A nectar'd flood of bliss— Nor did the Nymph forget that bounteous Queen Who walks refulgent through the Court of Night And smiles impartial o'er the trackless wild The fertile valley and the trem'lous wave Who from the radiant Crescent on her brow On all our Wanderings shed a cheering ray— The sounding Harp was full, and ev'ry string Drunk in the glorious flood of kindling light Her sweet voice to its utmost compass rose And rocks and hills and woods and falling streams Join'd their loud echoes to th' aspiring song. From Heav'n she turned from Earth she rais'd her eye And gaz'd on me while smiles hung round her lips She thus addressed— Thou art like the young breeze of the morn O'er the hills and the valeys it stray'd On a gay heedless pinion 'twas borne And it recked not where'er it was laid— Round the rough Mountain's brow it did play. And far over the Ocean's blue breast Through the Meadows of green held its way And the full blushing Rose it carress'd But what could it gather or bear From the rough mountain's brow or the deep Were not both of them barren and bare There was nought that the soft breeze could reap It is true that the grass of the field Did bow to the breeze as it pass'd To its kiss the rose blushing did yield 'Twas a perishing Odour at last— But what of the grass or the rose Could it carry away in its breast Again they were left to repose As though they had never been press'd. Though beautiful objects it met Their treasury it never could seize And 'tis carelessly wandering yet. 1825 7. For an Album The voice of Winter in this howling blast Tells of his quick approach—His chilling breath Has from the shivering groves their covering cast And ruthless torn it strews the burthened heath— But O may wintry time be slow to tear This Album's richly varied leaves away, The buds of genius that may blossom there, And wit's wild flowers innocently gay. If here the rose of love should chance to blush Or friendship's foliage tenderly entwine O may no icy hand the flow'ret crush Or rudely break the tendrils of the vine— And may thy life fair Delia softly flow A gentle stream through fields of joy its way Untroubled by the bitter storms of war Unclouded as a beauteous summer's day— November, 1826 8. Lines on Lake George Awake! The fresh morn breaks the mountains grey From the dark pillow of the gloomy night Reanimated raise their heads; Awake! Before thee lies the Holy Lake outspread, The blue Horican with its countless isles: Yet are the mists shadowing its bosom. Wake! On all the varied bosom of this earth This is the truest mirror of the sky And the fair moon as oft she rises o'er The eastern mountain's summit lingers there Enamoured: no earthly wave beside Returns her silver brightness to the skies, Unmingled with its own dark turbidness; The stars are pictured here so faithfully, That the lone wanderer on its pebbly shore, Doubts his own vision and with caution treads Upon the margin of the lower sky— The sun is smiling on yon distant isles That hang so tremulously o'er the deep— Nature in frolic once stretch'd forth her hand And from her mine of glittering gems conveyed Some glowing emeralds and careless o'er A crystal tablet strew'd them. There they lie In fragments spread, broken,—but beautiful— And yet how bright, how tranquil, how unearthly, How clear the bosom of this silver lake— Pleased with the privilege the eye explores The wat'ry realms and sees o'er golden sands The scaly thousands playing; the tall pine That shaded once the topmost cliff now resting Within some nook, as in a sepulchre, Wrap'd in a winding sheet of moss and weeds— O! that men's hearts were open as this wave Unto man's gazing and were found as spotless— Well might the holy priest crave for the fount So pure a stream; and doubly blessed were they, Who felt the sacred cross mark'd on their brows, In the cool impress of the saving flood— Not always was it pure as now 'tis seen The streams that pay their tribute to the lake, Were crimson'd once by men's hot blood, and cast Upon the waters blue, their horrid stain— But it has purified itself long since: The ruddy blush of shame but briefly dwells Upon the open brow of innocence— Yes! in yon narrow defile shut from day— Where doves now coo beneath the shade unsear'd; The warriors met thrice times in one short day— There is a rock now resting in that glen That could it speak of chivalrous deeds 'twould tell How the warm heart's blood trickled through the moss That covers it, how the stern warrior Faint with the loss of blood grasp'd its grey top Frowned on his enemy and fell, and died— Of that relentless massacre yon hills Were witness, they echo'd back the groans Of unarmed warriors, dying female shrieks, And the weak plaint of feeble innocence; Mingled with yells of Indians banqueting In blood— Turn from those sickening scenes of horror turn, Who that can gaze upon that dimpled lake; Would ever think that o'er its smiling face The trumpet's voice hath hoarsely sent defiance, That the green shores reflected there have been The ample stage whereon the bloody tragedy Of war was acted—one would well suppose That when men look'd upon its tranquil face The high tempestuous waves of passion 's storm Would settle into peacefulness—but man When in his breast rage hatred and revenge, Heeds not the quiet whisperings of nature— Happy are these calm and lovely days of peace The din of war with years hath pass'd away The trumpets thrilling voice does sometimes wake The sleeping echoes from their mountain couch But dying shrieks ne'er mingle with its tones— O may the voice of music that so chime With the wild mountain breeze and rippling lake Ne'er wake the soul but to a keener sense Of nature's beauties—How reluctant I Leave thy bright shores thou lov'd Horican But like yon skiff that glides away and melts In the wild distance—I may journey far Yet will my mind be dwelling upon thee; Yet the soft lisping of thy crystal wave Shall echo in my soul when I am far away. T. Cole 1826 9. To Mount Washington Hail Monarch of a thousand giant hills! Who settest proudly on the earth thy throne! Crowned with the clouds and the lightenings. Hail! Vast monument of power that God hath reared Upon the lowly earth to conquer time And measure out eternity—what sage So wise can tell when first thy dark rude top Pierc'd the blue heavens and with the sun midway— The season—hour—when thou shalt melt away And vanish like the cloudy mists thou art now nursing? When the all powerful hand of God shall crush Thy pond'rous rocks, and cast the dust Upon the changeful and unresting winds? Not one: Man's vaunted works since thou wert reared Have risen and crumbled—oblivious night Hath blotted empires out. And mighty things Have perish'd like a breath that only dying lives— October, 1828 10. Niagara Softly the light in these umbrageous realms Falls on the path, and plays upon the leaf— Softly the breeze now whispering steals between The thousand pillars of the quiet wood— And we with gentle musings, and fond thoughts Untroubled, free, pursue our pleasant way— What sound is that careering on the wings Of stormy blasts, so mightily and fills The lofty arches of the forest wide? Is it the clamor of impetuous winds That strive for egress from some rock-bound cave? Or is an earthquake waking from its wrath And from the high unstable mountain tops Hurling the ponderous and rebounding rocks? No! tis Niagara shouts from the abyss Where headlong he has cast him in his might! And rocks, and woods, and the astounded air, And earth's deep center tremble as with fear— Approach and view the wonder of a world See! when the waters of a hundred lakes An unheaped multitude tumultuous leap O'er the projecting crags, into the gulf— Thence the thick mist perpetual ascends, In cloudy piles into the sky and hides, The quivering torment of the floods below— Like steam emitted from some cauldron vast Vexed by furious and unquenching fires— Thou consummation of the earth's sublime! Thy course nor time, nor tide, nor change hath stemmed! Thy voice hath risen above the tempest's roar Year after year till countless they are grown— Seasons have looked upon thee and have died— Ages have vanish'd and the earth grown old— Man who hath moved mountains, bound the sea, Awe-struck recoils and works on thee no change The earth hath much of beauty but the choice Is garlanded around thine august brows— Yon, flaky foam is white as alpine snow— Yon gushing emerald clear as ocean's depths— The bow of promise sits on sable clouds; But lo! a far excelling iris girds The dazzling splendour of thy snowy breast— Ages untold thy voice broke forth unheard; But by the shrinking wolf, or the tim'rous deer Or wandering savage of the echoing wild— Until an enterprise sublime unbarred The mighty portals of the golden west And midst its teeming fulness thou wast found Majestic in the wilderness enthroned— Written at the Falls May, 1829 [11. Alas! he is a wretch who has no home] Alas! he is a wretch who has no home, Kindred nor friends on whom to turn his thought, Whose lot is o'er the cold wide world to roam: Whose season of return is never sought Whose wanderings are alike unmark'd—unknown By Mother, Sister, Wife, by any loving one— He is a torn weed on a desolate sea Toss'd by the waves and beaten by the winds And driven by currents unresistingly From deep to deep, and never finds A peaceful haven when the tide will fling It gently round some mossy rock to cling. And like the wind on some vast wilderness That sighing seeketh rest, but seeks in vain, Unlov'd and uncarress'd, companionless It mournful wanders o'er the dreary plain. If to outlive affection is my doom Welcome will be the shelter of the Tomb. 1829 12. Let not the ostentatious gaud of art Let not the ostentatious gaud of art, That tempts the eye, but touches not the heart, Lure me from nature's purer love divine: But, like a pilgrim, at some holy shrine, Bow down to her devotedly, and learn, In her most sacred features, to discern That truth is beauty. [1829] 13. Written on my Birthday, Feb. 1, 1830 Into the deep of the eternal past, Another year hath sunk and what alas? Is saved from the wreck, but recollections dim Of unripe joys, and fears and hopes vague And evanescent as the morning mists— Another year is past! Where are the joys That hope had wreathed round the year like flowers, Last Natal day? Lov'd shadows they are fled— O fickle Fortune—as the rainbow deck'd, Like it forever flying when pursued, Unjust. How oft into the lap of sloth Thy treasures rich are cast—And thou bright Fame, Through bitter storms hath led; and in the night When wearied nature has demanded sleep Hath waked me up to gaze on thee. How cold Thy beams! How distant is thy sphere! Did ever lover with so chaste a flame And so devoted meet with such ill success— Ye children of my fancy and my care! Neglected and despised and careless cast Into the shade, unmark'd amid the crowd That have a name; or gaudy force, the gaze And wonder of the ignorant and vain— Are ye devoid of beauty? Can no eye Delight in you but mine? perhaps too fond My fancy pictures scenes and desires They on the canvas glow and live, where naught But formal insipidity exists— How oft the voice of praise breaks forth o'er works More fortunate than mine and there descants How skillfully the orb hath mimick'd nature How every tent and form is beautiful and true— Then pass me by as though I ne'er had drank One draught at the great universal spring— Ye mountains, woods, rocks, and impetuous streams Ye mantling heav'ns—Speak—speak for me! Have I not held communion close with you And like to one who is enamoured, gazed Intensely on your ever varying charms, And has it been in vain? 14.

I see the green Fiesole arise] I see the green Fiesole arise, A pyramid whose flowers and vine-clad steeps, Are proudly crown'd by ancient walls, where lies The latest loveliest sunbeam when it sleeps To shade and Arno winding through the vale, Grows brighter as the shades of earth prevail— Fiesole and Arno both are fam'd in song I view your beauty; but I cannot feel; And grieve to find my heart can do me wrong. There is a blight on me, a stoney chill— Upon the glow of heaven and earth I gaze, But do not burn as in my earlier days— O let me leave the world if it can steal Nature's best dower from me—the gift to feel. Florence June, 1831 [16. A lonely cloud is flitting round the brow] A lonely cloud is flitting round the brow Of the dark barren mountain; but the glow Of the unrisen sun illumes each fold Transmuting blackness into living gold— And so around my des'late soul does cling One melancholy thought—a shadowy thing Which from the world has sprung, in a dark hour When the worst genius of my fate had power— But hope is dawning—and its sun will rise From death's deep ocean, and the distant skies Already cast a tone delightful o'er my mind And to my sojourn here shall make resign'd. For Time will quickly waft me o'er that sea When earthly sorrow cannot follow me. Catskill 1832 [17.

Thou guardian spirit—whom a mother's prayer Brought down from heaven to guard her son, Be watchful—shield and protect from snares Of sin—And let the haven soon be won— The welcome home of everlasting peace Where pain and trouble shall forever cease.

Catskill 1834 19. Lines Written after a Walk on [a] Beautiful Morning in November Unhoped for joys are always welcomest, And fountains in the desert doubly bless'd— So 'mid the storms of the declining year More beautiful the sunny hours appear— From darkling dreams of night I wake, and lo! Through the unmeasured depths of heaven flow, The unresounding tides of gold and azure— The earth with light is filled, my heart with pleasure. My footsteps lead through that contiguous grove, Where oft I've wander'd with the friends I love; But 'tis no more umbrageous and green As in the summer months; but slant between The innumerable trunks the sunbeams play, And weave with shade, a mingled night and day. Hid is the earth, by withering foliage brown'd The brightest loveliest wild-flowers' chosen ground; Where beamed amid the shade their modest eyes, The walnut now and chaliced acorn lies Crush'd are the crackling leaves although I tread Gently; for I remember o'er my head, In July's sultriness and glare they made A most inviting paradise of shade; Coolness and perfume giving to the breeze, And to the soul an atmosphere of peace— O! never! never! should the friends laid low, (Like these sere leaves) from out the memory go; And as around their graves we chance to tread, Let us recall the virtues of the dead— For even these relics of the vanish'd year A lingering, living, balmy fragrance bear— The Hudson lies below, a mirror'd heaven; Stainless, save where the joyous hills are given With grassy slope, dark rock, and breezy wood In purple beauty to the wooing flood— Yon sails unruffled now, by torturing storms, Like swans enamoured of their own bright forms; Or spirits that have left the sky to gaze Upon the earth's clear mirror, in amaze— Supported on unclosing wings they float As wind-borne music's softest, sweetest note. But yet they move, the deep unresting tide Bears quickly onward; distance soon will hide Their voyaging towards the main—Thus we Upon the winding stream of human life, In its calm, happier days, when wo and strife Are far; live all within ourselves—forget The ebbing tide of time, is swiftly set Towards eternity; nor think that storm May soon o'ertake us, and our course deform— E'en now upon yon distant bark a change Is come—the west-wind in its boundless range Has breathed upon it gently, and a shade Deep blue and dark of rippling waves is laid Athwart the lower heaven and from the stream The pictured form is vanish'd like a dream— The mountains are before me; the strong chain That binds to central earth the prostrate plain— They like high watch-towers o'er the wide spread land Upon the shore of heaven's ocean stand— And I have thought that such might landmarks be To voyaging spirits on th' etherial sea— And they are still; and stern—with fixed look; But beautiful like those who have forsook All earthly thoughts for holier things on high And hold alone communion with the sky— Few days are past, since in a robe of gold, And purple they were clad; but now the fold, Is of a soberer hue and thinly spread Like drapery o'er the features of the dead— From those aerial castles to my feet Extends a scene such as the eye can meet Not frequently, although earth's realms are wide And beauty does in every clime abide— A landscape where, lawn, wood so interlace And hill meets vale in such a soft embrace; And in the midst a basin deeply placed To catch the azure that the heavens waste— Poets may leave their Grecian Temple well Content, in this our western vale to dwell. I hear the voice of stillness the sweet sound Of unseen waters, that from some profound Have utt'rance, filling the echoless sky With one long breath of music—And the sigh Of the responsive hills, is like soft grief That in itself alone, finds best relief— O! let me fill my soul with this bright scene And garner up its beauty ere the sheen That this heaven-favored day has given, By wintry storms is from its bosom riven— Though now it glows resplendent 'neath the sun; And streams through silent groves undimpled run; And mountain shades alone in hollows lie, Those calm blue cradles of tranquility— And the unrobed woods are softly warm And quiet sleeping as though never storm Had tortured them—Alas! too soon must come The conflict of the winds, that from the womb, Of the vast circumambient shall be born Giants—He of the south who howls in scorn, And heaves the deluge on the shrinking land— And He who from the north puts forth his hand, And shakes down heaven in the chilling drift, And wields the viewless ice-bolt keen and swift— E'en now upon the far horizons verge A gloom uplifts; it is the foremost surge, Of winter's darksome sea— So quickly fly All beauteous things, we gaze and love—they die. Be it not mine ungrateful thoughts to raise; Beauty though transient, sheds on us its rays, To warm and vivifie—Transient is the sun; But earth rejoices as his course is run— T. C. Catskill 1833 [20. Vain is my fondest hope! Alone—alone] Vain is my fondest hope! Alone—alone Through the wide weary world, I tread nor find That loving spirit—that congenial one, Would mingle soul with my soul—mind with mind, And like two fountains forming one deep stream Whose waters clear should be divided never; Warbling their way as beauteous as a dream Of Heaven, that shall be dreamed and dreamed forever. Yes! I have wished for one to dream with me When was my mood the real world to leave For the far brighter realm of fantasy— And when descended into earthly care As clouds must sometimes rest on mountain tops My sorrows disappointments love to share And let her joys be my joys—hopes my hopes— And thus the river of our love should be Augmenting as it flowed towards Eternity— 1833 21. On seeing that a favorite tree of the Author's had been cut down— And is the glory of the forest dead? Struck down? Its beauteous foliage spread On the base earth? O! ruthless was the deed Destroying man! What demon urg'd the speed Of thine unpitying axe? Didst thou not know My heart was wounded by each savage blow? Could not the lovliness that did begird These boughs disarm thine hand and save the bird Its ancient home and me a lasting joy! Vain is my plaint! All that I love must die. But death sometimes leaves hope—friends may yet meet And life be fed on expectation sweet— But here no hope survives; again shall spread o'er me Never the gentle shade of my beloved tree— Catskill June 22, 1834 22.

The Painter's Lamentation That there should be a poison in sweet looks Alas!—Alas that all the tameless brooks Which murmur wildly through the vale of love Should taste of bitterness! That those who rove The labarynthine dell, should go astray Bewildered, blinded, heedless of the way Of wisdom and of peace!—Such is my fate— And O ye mountains that I lov'd of late My early adoration yet despite not him, Who now though not forgetting doth neglect Your charms—Sighing he owns the deep defect; But destiny unkind and unexpected care, Have torn him from you, and a fond despair Embraces now his heart and in its core Is rooted deep and perhaps forever more— Thou radiant spirit! whose dear controul Long time hath bless'd me—Sister of my soul! And wonder of all eyes! My glorious art! Wilt thou desert and desolate the heart Which thou hast shielded through so many years From various ills?—Then have I cause for tears— For from my sweet lips I have drunk the dew Of more than earthly happiness, and drew From out thy taintless breath etherial joy— An essence heavenly—alas that it should die— And this because a mortal feeling came— A gush as of unconquerable flame Consumes my heart—But this is vain— I am the guilty and why do I complain?— Because my crime is one I cannot hate— Because it is a shadow which my fate Cast over me—It like a cloud arose, Gently and beautifully—budded like a rose— I dream'd not such a bright cloud could ere contain, When first 'twas seen, fierce tempests dark and rain Or that the bud, so beautiful, in its core A blackness and a bitter poison bore— It is no crime to love; but it is pain To me and torture—for I ne'er shall gain Her whom I so desire—her heart is cold But perhaps 'twould melt beneath the touch of gold— That talisman I have not—nor desire To kindle ought but love's unsordid fire— A hour's departed, have ye no return? Have ye no spring, like flowers? Does then the urn Of Time contain, nought but unquick'ning dust Of the past lov'd and beautiful? And must Our dearest sunniest pleasure pass away And endless night succeed the swift-wing'd day? Ah me! I little dream'd when wand'ring free In heart and mind, in lands beyond the sea— That 'mid the mountains of my early love, I should unlearn their beauty,—or more true, My heart should learn unfaithfulness—The dew Of morning yet ascends in misty wreaths, To bind their brows of majesty—the wind yet breathes Through the dark forests that around them cling, And on their crags the eagle flaps his wing— Those were bright hours my loving mem'ry sees, When by the convent gray I sat—beneath the trees That shadowy wave on Mont Albana's top, An emerald crown barbarian time did drop Relenting that the marble-columned pile That once stood there his rude hands did despoil. And Rome was at my feet, but far below, Its ruined heaps still sparkling in the glow Of the unfading sun, which shone as bright As in the conquering Carthaginians' sight— Around the wide Campagna's waste of green Lay like a shipless sea—though wrecks were seen Of duct and tower—many a golden chain On its breast broken—ne'er to join again— Sracte like an island shone afar The sabine mountains made the eastern bar While on the west—the tideless beauteous sea Pillowed the plain that slumb'red tranquilly— But this is past—and my soul's freshness gone The lyre is broken—the harp has lost its tone— O babbling stream! That flowest careless on In everlasting joy!—Where! where is flown Thy beauty?—How art thou chang'd since last I stood upon thy margin—has it pass'd With the quick hours that stole my peace? I never deem'd thy lovliness would cease Over the bright rocks yet I see thee skim; Thou art not chang'd stream!—My eyes are dim— O pride thou yet unconqurable one, Come to my aid—steel me and let me frown Instead of weep—break—break the cankering chain That binds me—let no love remain To fester in my bosom—let my art Again, alone, be mistress of my heart— [July, 1834] [24. Again the wreathed snow] Again the wreathed snow Girdles and crowns the mountains: Again is chain'd the flow Of the once joyous fountains: Again the dark gray forests wildly wave With doleful music in the biting blast Unlike the gentle murmurings they gave When summer's foliage was o'er them cast And yet I linger here; The City calls aloud To leave the woodlands sere And join the busy crowd— I loiter gazing o'er the distant hills That beauty ne'er deserts though clad In wintry garb; and tarry by the rills Whose summer warblings oft have made me glad Why do I tarry there? A holy calm pervades The rural earth—where men Assemble there is turmoil; but these shades Are unto me a solemn sacred place, Where Envy—malice—pride can never come Or coming, quickly all that demon race Languish and die—the wildwood is their tomb— Catskill November 1, 1834 [25. O Cedar Grove! whene'er I think to part] O Cedar Grove! whene'er I think to part From thine all peaceful shades my aching heart Is like to his who leaves some blessed shore A weeping exile ne'er to see it more— Catskill November, 1834 [26. I sigh not for a stormless clime] I sigh not for a stormless clime, Where drowsy quiet ever dwells, Where purling waters changeless clime Through soft and green unwinter'd dells— For storms bring beauty in their train; The hills that roar'd beneath the blast The woods that welter'd in the rain Rejoice whene'er the tempest's past. Their faces lifting to the sky With fresher brightness, richer hue; As though the blast had brought them joy, Darkness and rain dropp'd gladness too— So storms of ill when pass'd away Leave in our souls serene delight; The blackness of the stormy day, Doth make the welcome calm more bright— January 25, 1835 [27. Cast off the bands that bind thee now] “Cast off the bands that bind thee now Each strand is steep'd in pain.” Thus spoke a voice—I made a vow To break them all—'twas vain— Shall man within whose heart's core flows Affection's burning tide Chill it with wordliness and close Its gush in icy pride? He cannot if he has that spark Of heaven's fire called love Quenchless it burns amid the storm True as the stars above. May 28, 1835 28. Hope and Trust Spring from the Contemplation of the Works of God Mine eyes bedimmed with tears I heavenward raised Called by some Spirit of a better sphere, And through the universal ether gazed And marked the golden orbs that did appear To tremble mid the dark abyss profound; But yet they faltered not; nor sank; nor swerved In glory marching their majestic round, In everlasting harmony preserved. “Is there cause for tears” the spirit said: “When all these ponderous worlds are thus sustained By that invisible hand and gently led Through the wide fields of heaven; like sheep restrained From wandering by their shepherd's gentle voice. Within His hand is held thy soul, thine all; List! thou wilt hear that Shepherd's loving call. Is there then cause for tears? Thou shouldst rejoice!” August 16, 1835 29. Evening Thoughts When Evening in the sky sits calm and pure And all the fleecy clouds are still and bright And earth beneath the silent air obscure Waits for the stars that herald in the night; All earth-born cares unholy cease to move; Peace dwells on earth and beauty in the sky— Then is the spirit melted as with love And tears spring forth upon the brink of joy. But whence the shade of sadness o'er us thrown When thoughts are purest in that quiet hour? From sense of sin arises that sad tone? Knowing that we alone feel passion's power, That touches not the mountain far and lone— Or is it that the fading light reminds That we are mortal and the latter day Steals onward swiftly, like the unseen winds, And all our years are clouds that quickly pass away.

Winter had fled into his northern home] Winter had fled into his northern home— The voice of waters to my charmed ear Rose as rejoicing that the spring had come To bless yon vale to me forever dear— And with the sound melodious did arise Upon my soul the sense of former joys, As though the spirit of departed years Dwelt in that music soft unmix'd with tears— But sadness sits upon my heart and spring Comes not with wonted gladness, pleasantly; But sorrow, gloom, sit darkly on her wing And though she smiles—her smiles are not for me; For sickness lays its withering hand, alas! On one who loves to watch the early grass And buds come forth and flowers that gently send Abroad their fragrance sweet—my kindest friend! Catskill May 23, 1836 33. On hearing of the death of Mr. Reed— It came to me—the word that he was dead— My Benefactor! To myself I said It is a dream—I strove to wake, Alas! The dream if such it is will never pass— The earth is darker though 'tis summer now, And heaven does wear a shadow on its brow, And the deep green of the far waving hills The once gay flowers, the ever singing rills Have ta'en a tone of sadness and no more Unlock the springs of joy; but daily pour An influence regretful on my soul, And bid forth tears that I would fain controul. O cease my tears ye are too soft for grief Grief such as mine—I would not your relief. Catskill June, 1836 34. Lines occasioned by the death of Mr. Luman Reed If friendship hath the power to lift the soul Above the common flight of worldly thought; Or gratitude t' enkindle pure poetic fire, This pen would flow with ever living words By sorrow consecrated to the latest time— And one unskill'd in verse would rev'rent pay A tribute to thy memory O Reed, And place a wreath embalm'd by honest tears Upon thy tomb to bloom forever there— For thine is not the ruthless conqueror's claim A proud renown inscrib'd in blood and wrong Upon men's hearts with wonder and with fear; But dwelleth in our memory a living light To cheer and to illumine and to guide Us who linger mid the shades of life— O bright example of superior worth! Would that the world did turn to such as thee T' admire and emulate and leave the gaud The ostentation and the baleful glare. Of those who mounted in Ambition's Car, Like pestilential meteors swiftly rush Through the applauding multitude of men To dazzle and destroy— Thy life of peace Was like the summer cloud that rose at morn To grace the earth and as the day advanced Increas'd in beauty; 'till the setting sun Wrapp'd it in splendour ere the night was come. That night alas: came at the hour of noon When least our charmed eyes expected change; Change such as this so sudden and so dark— Our hearts were all rejoicing in fond hope, Full of expectant joy—not dreaming Death Stood by with icy hand uprais'd to strike He struck! Deep in my breast the blow was felt And droop'd my spirit—he alas! was gone My ever honoured friend! I look'd around The earth was dreary and the sunshine past— I wake at dawn of day and gaze as wont Upon the hills uplifted to the clouds; But a cold shadow broods upon my soul That should enkindle at the glorious sight. I wander in the evening's twilight calm When woods and streams sleep 'neath the sapphire sky; And then the heavenly spirit of the hour Would steal into my heart, but that 'tis full Of a deep dwelling sorrow that upheaves Like a huge billow on some lonely shore That swells and breaks in mournful music there. E'en the strong charm of my all matchless art, Whose fervent votary I claim to be, And once did deem no earthly cause could mar Is powerless now and yields me joy no more— He who is ta'en away did best sustain, Encourage in the arduous pursuit, And truly loving it well knew to give Essential praise and just, and pointed high To the steep sun-crown'd hill of Excellence. Earth is the vestibule of Heaven where Some erring wander and some meekly wait; Our friend dwelt with us until Death Who hath the key, did open unto him The golden gate and we are left without To tears and darkness, wond'ring what time We through that glorious portal shall be led To see that face benign which now can never change. Sorrow alone should not usurp the pen; But it should teem with praise most justly due Not such vain praise as vulgar tongues bestow On puffed-up favourites of fortune or of fame; But that which virtue doth from truth demand. For the warm heart of him we now lament Was fix'd in strong integrity and truth, And candour generosity and taste Grew sweetly round as may the flowers About the firm-set oak cling not encumb'ring But spread with beauty, fragrance and rich fruit— Let not a Cosmo or Lorenzo fam'd Firenze's favoured princes all engross Our admiration; for this western land Had one munificent as they, less proud; Who lov'd like them to nurse the growing arts, But with a purer love and more exalted end; Who plotted not to tyrannise and rule; But trod the nobler though less dazzling path That leads up to the Altar of the public weal— But he is dead! That thought will rise and praise Is faltering where 'tis grief o'erwhelmed the soul— The stream may not be stemm'd so let it flow It hath the power to purify and Hope Shall spring from out its waters, onward led By bright example up to virtue's radiant fame— Summer is past, but not my grief which chords With the Autumnal blast through the grove With mournful cadence, 'neath the waning moon, Sighs fitfully; as the distracted leaves Are hurried to and fro in wild unrest— But the rude gale shall cease and winter drear Again give place unto the coming spring And the bare groves shall put their verdure on Rejoicing that the winter winds are spent; Which came not to destroy; but to prepare For fresher beauty, renovated youth— So shall our souls beneath the icy blasts Of death and sorrow, shrink, but never die And the dark desolation of the heart Be but the germe of joy which shall burst forth In the perennial sunshine of Immortal life. Catskill 1836 35. Song of the Spirit of the Mountain A glorious privilege it is to wear a Spirit's form And solitary dwell for aye on this high mountain-peak; To watch afar beneath my feet the darkly heaving storm And see its cloudy billows o'er the craggy ramparts break; To hear the hurrying blast Torment the groaning woods O'er precipices cast The desolating floods.— To mark in wreathèd fire The crackling pines expire:— To list the Earthquake's and the Thunder's voice Round and beneath my everlasting Throne; Meanwhile unscathed, untouched I still rejoice And sing my psalm of gladness all alone. Through the clear ether that surrounds my home My keen eyes watch the far, bewildering spheres Each comet wild that tracked the midnight dome, Within the deep recesses of my mind appears For ages past.—Years! They are nought to me! And centuries on centuries roll by harmlessly. First to salute the Sun when he breaks through the night I gaze upon him still when Earth has lost its light. He loves me e'en when winter's gloom enfolds the world below And lights my mountain-pinnacle enwreathed with drifted snow That mid deep heaven lifted high by mortals seen afar Through rifts of sable clouds appears a new and burning star. When silence is most deathlike And darkness deepest cast, The streamlet's voice is breathlike And dews are falling fast; Far through the azure depths above, my clarion-songs resound; Like voices of winds and waves and woods and deep tones of the ground I wave my shadeless pinions o'er this my calm domain; A solitary realm it is; but where 'tis joy to reign. [July, 1837] [36. The wight who climbs the mountain's gleaming side] The wight who climbs the mountain's gleaming side Treads not the azure that he saw from far But rugged rocks and ravines dark and wide:— And dangerous steeps and precipices mar The hill's broad sky-ward bosom and the shady dell Where once, in the distance viewing, he had long'd to dwell. Nor in th' aerial nook, espied on high, Screen'd from the sun's intensest ray, The seeming haunt of bless'd tranquility, He finds repose—There 'mid the deaf'ning bray Of cataracts, grisly crags and ever dripping rocks, Forever desolate, the narrow vale enlocks— It was the heaven stooping to the world, The crystal ether of supernal space, That smooth'd the rugged wild and soft unfurled A veil of beauty o'er the mountain's face— So bare, dark is human thought till heaven descends And to its aspect drear celestial beauty lends— July 14, 1837 37. Written in Autumn Another year like a frail flower is bound In time's sere withering aye to cling, Eternity, thy shadowy temples round, Like to the musick of a broken string That ne'er can sound again, 'tis past and gone, Its dying sweetness dwells within memory alone— Year after year with silent lapse fleet by; Each seems more brief than that which went before; The weeks of youth are years; but manhood's fly On swifter wings, years seem but weeks, no more— So glides a river through a thirsty land, Wastes as it flows till lost amid the Desert sand. The green of Spring which melts the heart like love Is faded long ago, the fiercer light Of hues autumnal, fire the quivering grove, And rainbow tints array the mountain-height— A pomp there is, a glory on the hills And gold and crimson stream reflected from the rills. But 'tis a dying pomp a gorgeous shroud T' enwrap the lifeless year—I scarce forgive The seeming mockery of death; but that aloud A voice sounds through my soul—“All things live To die and die to be renewed again, Therefore we should rejoice at death and not complain.” Catskill October, 1837 [38. Mother! All hallowed word forever bless'd!] Mother! All hallowed word forever bless'd! Forever dear to man and most to me, But utter'd now 'mid sighs but ill suppress'd, And rising tears that struggle to be free— Mother! Alas thou dost not answer; 'neath the ground Thy willing ear is clos'd, nor heedeth mortal sound— My Mother! Still, the dear, lov'd name I call It is the natural musick of my tongue, Sad now its tones, but potent to recall To mind thy love, thy tenderness, how strong! And call I vainly? No! The Grave does not enclose Thy spirit; freed from earth undying it arose— Hope tells me, and a holy hope like this Can not be false, whether tis thine to dwell Beyond the Stars, or in thy blessedness Dost linger near thy children, lov'd so well, A Heaven-appointed time; thy kind, maternal care Still lives—Still thine eye sees us—still thou heard our prayer— My voice lifts not complaining—Thou art ta'en From earthly trouble—impious it would be To wish thee in this darksome world again To bear with us a sad mortality: But nature is unconquerable—grief will rise Within a filial bosom, when a Mother dies. Not with complaining, but with gratitude The dear rememberances of love arise— Thy watchful care with tenderness imbued— Countless anxieties—self sacrifice— Wave upon wave till uncontroll'd bursts forth Thy soul in flattering accents; tribute to thy worth— October 30, 1837 [39. On the frore shadow of yon mountain-steep] On the frore shadow of yon mountain-steep I gaze remembering every tender dye Of Summer and of Autumn, rich and deep, The joyous forest's gorgeous pride, and sigh That the soft seasons speed so swiftly away And Winter lingers with unkind delay— I gaze; but not as once 'twas mine to gaze With heart too full of youthful hope for gloom Ere those Belov'd Ones we did gently place Within the confines of the Silent Tomb— Since then the seasons wear a sadder hue And Evening's golden tints are faded too— January 12, 1838 [40. Thine early hopes are fading, one by one] Thine early hopes are fading, one by one, The brightest, loftiest are the first to die, Grow faint or cold and perish mournfully. As in the splendour of the laughing sun Where mountains put their evening glory on The burnish'd clouds do gladden all the sky 'Til sunk Day's orb (as my bright youth did merge) The highest in the Zenith first is dead; And so successive withering to the verge Of the drear ocean, until night is spread And winds and waves chaunt forth their funeral dirge. Yet thus benighted! Youth's false visions fled! One changeless Hope remains to cheer my breast, A lasting Day shall dawn in the resplendant East. Catskill March 28, 1838 [41. Thine early Hopes are fading one by one] Thine early Hopes are fading one by one The brightest loftiest are the first to die Grow faint; or cold; perish mournfully. So in the splendor of the joyous sun The burnished clouds do gladden all the sky And laughing put their evening-glory on. Till sunk the orb amid the murmuring surge: The highest in the concave first is dead And so successive withering to the verge Of ocean drear—night's fall is o'er them spread And winds and waves chaunt forth a funeral dirge. Yet thus benighted; Youthful visions fled One changeless hope remains to cheer my breast: A day will dawn in the Eternal East. Catskill [March 28, 1838] [42. And shall I halt midway in my career] And shall I halt midway in my career, Just as I see the beauteous Fane appear 'Mid th' golden clouds of the horizon far The Shrine of my devotion and my pilgrimage— Find neath my feet which yet unwearied are; Before my eyes undimmed as yet by age A gulf mysterious whose cloudy depths defy A passage—Vain are my efforts—Hope is near to die— July 1, 1838 [43. Thou frail and feeble vine!] Thou frail and feeble vine! Year after year I watch with pitying eye Thy delicate fingers twine Around that oak, whose sturdy branches high Wave in the sun, in fruitless vain essay To rise from the dismal shade to glorious day. In summer's genial hour Thy leaves and light-green tendrils stretch aloft With hope-inspiring power: But Winter comes too soon and all thy soft Thy young, gay foilage shrinks in sudden death And the old stem alone remains beneath. My fate resembles thine— I toil to gain a sunnier realm of light And excellence—waste and pine In the low shadow of this world of night.— The genial season sometimes bear me up 'Till hope persuades I ne'er again shall stoop; But quickly come the withering blast to blight My rich and prided growth—and I remain The same low thing to bud—to fade again. July 22, 1838 [44. I saw a cave of sable depth profound] I saw a cave of sable depth profound Oped 'neath a precipice whose awful height Was lost mid clouds that darkly hung around Forever hiding from the human sight Its vast mysterious head—About the mouth Of the black cavern grisly mosses hung And clambering herbage in festoons uncouth Did wildly wave like hair—The stray winds sung With the rude rock, the tangled growth, the Cavern these Strains mingled deep—of Lovely Joy of dark Despair— [October, 1838] 45. Sonnet O that in adamant were cased my breast! Or closed mine ear against the distracting noise Of the great strife political! That voice Which like a hurrying whirlwind comes unblessed And prostrates man's affections, sympathies, Domestic joys and duties—makes the Guest An Enemy and deadly hate has placed 'Twixt Brothers. Holy peace and virtue fly Before that fierce and multitudinous cry For Liberty. Dishonored name! Shouts shrill, Of Selfishness they are and lawless Will. My soul is sad; for Freedom sinks to die, Where Party hath usurped her sacred throne And Love's and Truth's bright Altars overthrown. November 8, 1838 46. The Complaint of the Forest It was a living day, such as makes man Know that he has a spirit—feel he has a soul Which is not coop'd up in its mortal clay; But plays around it like a flame—enjoys And touches all the visible—communes And mingles with the elements themselves— The arch of heaven was darkly deep—no stain In all that boundless ether sea was seen And earth sped onward like a sunlit bark Bound to some distant haven, richly fraught— The quick fresh air engender'd in those depths And nurs'd by mountains, held a subtle joy As though from founts of everlasting health It gush'd—such vigor giving man's frame He almost felt himself a god and mov'd along With an unwonted majesty and power— It was in early summer when the earth Was wrapp'd in flowers—floating in music made By a myriad voices which did sing One sweet, one universal song—“Rejoice This is the hour when heav'n descends to earth Laden with beauty and with love—Rejoice.” I sat beside a lake serene and still Earth's off'ring to th' imperial sky, Which the huge heav'nward mountains aloft held The purest she possest—Around it rose Walls of indurate rock, that upward swept Until they quiver'd mid th' Empyrean An amphitheatre hugely built it seemed By giants of the primal world, and though The flood destroyed the mighty builders—hurled From dizzy heights the ponderous battlements And crush'd the massive seats; it yet remained A ruin more sublime than if a thousand Roman colloseums had been pil'd in one— And woods deep dark and tangled, rank o'er rank Upon the pure and peaceful lake look'd down, A silent people, through the long long years— 'Tis joy which expression has no voice To sit, when day is sinking, by that lake To mark the breeze play on the mountain's top And toss pine and beechen foilage gray; And from the pink Azalia's fragrant flowers And violet white haste with its honeyed breath To kiss with gentle lips the grassy deep; Bowing the lily to its brim as in the midst Of the innumerable wavelets it doth seem A gallant bark with beauty deeply fraught Careening gaily o'er the dancing waves— And then to feel that thou art far away From man's impure resort—from sordid care— From turmoil and from dust—free as the wind To muse fond thoughts from worldliness set free. And twilight o'er that scene so wildly grand Spread its empurpled wings; with solemn shade Sublimer far—more deep—more holy too Than that within dim temples vast and high Whose clust'ring shafts cast years of anxious care, And agony and sweat, wrung from the brows Of groaning multitudes—to gratify Imperial pomp and pride— 'Twas that bless'd hour When angels, hov'ring in the crimson clouds, Commune with man whose grov'lling instincts low Have been cast off as robes of earthliness Beside the fount of nature's solitude— Over my senses stole a deep repose, And dreams which are but wakefulness of soul, A brief exemption from encumb'ring earth— I heard a sound—'twas wild and strange—a voice As of ten thousand—musical it was A gush of richest concord—deep and slow— A song that fill'd the universal air— It was the voice of the great Forest that arose From every valley and dark mountain top Within the bosom of this mighty land— Complaint— Mortal whose love for our umbrageous realms Exceeds the love of all the race of men; Whom we have lov'd and for whom have spread With welcome, our innumerable arms— Wind fed with fruits of more than earthly taste— Who from the haunts of men have oftimes fled To seek consolation in our shades— Open thine ears! The voice that ne'er before Was heard by living man—is lifted up And fills the air—The voice of our complaint— Thousands— Thousands of years, yea, they have passed away As drops of dew upon the sunlit flower; Or silver vapours on the summer sea— Thousands of years, like wind-strains on the harp; Or like forgotten thoughts, have passed away Unto the bourne of unremembered things— Thousands of years! when earth first broke Through Chaos and sprung forth exultingly— Even then the stars beheld us waving high Upon the mountains, shining in the vales— Ere yet the race of man had seen their light. Before the marble bosom of the earth Was scarr'd by steel, and granite masses rent From the precipitous crag, to build a Thebes Or old Persepolis, whose founders are forgot, Our arms were clasp'd around the hills, our locks Shadow'd the streams that lov'd us—our green breasts Were resting places for the weary clouds— All then was harmony and peace—but man Arose—he who now vaunts antiquity— He the destroyer—amid the shades Of oriental realms, destruction's work began— Echoes whose voice had answered to the call Of thunder or the winds alone; or to the cry Of cataracts, sound of sylvan habitants, Or songs of birds—utter'd responses sharp And dissonant—the axe—the unresting axe Incessant smote our venerable ranks, And crashing branches frequent lash'd the ground. Stupendous trunks the pride of many years, Roll'd on the groaning earth with all their umbrage. Stronger than wintry blasts it swept along That fierce tornado—stayless perpitual, Increasing as it flew, until the earth Our ancient mother lay, blasted and bare Beneath the burning sun—The little streams That oft had rais'd their voices in the breeze In joyful unison with ours, did waste And pin'd away as though in deep despair— Our trackless shades, our dim ubiquity, The solemn garb of the primeval world— Our glory, our magnificence, was rent— And but in difficult places, shelter'd vales The remnants of our failing race were found, Like scatter'd clouds upon the mountain tops— The vast Hyrcanian fell and Lebanon's Dark ranks of Cedar were cut down like grass. And restless man whose poets sung the joys Of our green tranquil shades; whose sages taught That Innocence and Peace, the daughters fair Of solitude, within our precincts dwelt; Held not his arm until necessity Stern master even of him, seiz'd it and bound And from extinction sav'd our scanty tribes— Seasons there were when man at war with man Left us to raze huge cities, desolate Old Empires and to shed his blood on soil That once was all our own—When Death had made All silent, all secure—we would return And twist our roots around the prostrate shafts And broken capitals, or strike them deep Into the soil made richer by man's blood— Such seasons were but brief, so soon the earth Again made sanctified by shade, and art Again resolv'd to nature, man came back, And once more swept our feeble hosts away— And yet there was one bright virgin continent Remote, that Roman name had never reached; Nor ancient dreams in all their universe— As inaccessible in primal time Unto man's thought and eye, as far Uranus In his secret void—For round it swept Deep dangerous seas—a homeless waste Of troubled waves whose everlasting roar Echo'd in every zone of heaven—whose drear expanse Spread gloomy, trackless as the midnight sky. And stories dire of whirlpools fierce and vast Of stagnant oceans—monsters terrible That shook the mariner's soul o'er that dread sea Spread horrour and rais'd a barrier far more strong Than the unresting tides around that land— The land of beauty and of many climes— The land of mighty cataracts—where now Columbia's eagle flaps her chainless wing— Thus guarded through long centuries untouch'd By man—save him our native child whose foot Disdains the sunbeat soil—who lov'd Our shafted halls, the covert of the deer— We flourish'd we rejoic'd—from mountain top To mountain top we gaz'd and saw o'er vales And glimm'ring plains our banners green Wide waving—yet untorn— Gladly the spring On bright and bloomy wing shed fragrance over us,— And summer laugh'd beneath our verdant roof— And autumn sigh'd to leave our golden courts. And when the crimson leaves were strew'd in showers Upon the broad lap of Oregon wild Or mighty Huron's wave of Lazuli, Winter uprais'd his rude and boreal songs, And we responded in a chorus wild— O peace primeval! Would that thou hadst staid! What mov'd thee to unbar thine azure gates O mighty oceans when the destroyer came?— Stray'd then thy blasts around Olympus-Air? Or were they lull'd to breezes round the brain Of rich Granada's crafty conqueror, When with pinion strong they should have crushed Our enemy—And furious smote as when The fleet of Xerxes on the Grecian coast Was cast like foam and weed upon the rocks— But impotent the voice of our complaint: He came—Few were his numbers first; but soon The work of desolation was begun, Close by the heaving main; then on the banks Of rivers far inland our strength was shorn; And fire and steel did all their office well— No stay was there—no rest— The tiny cloud Oft seen in torrid climes, at first sends out Its puny breezes; but augmenting soon In darkness and in size—spans the broad sky With lurid palm and sweeps stupendous o'er The crashing world—And thus comes rushing on This human hurricane—which hath no bounds. E'en this secluded spot our sanctuary, Which the stern rocks have frowning held aloft Our enemy has mark'd—These gentle lakes Shall lose our presence in their limpid flood, And from the mountains we shall melt away, Like wreath of mist upon the winds of heaven— Our doom is near; behold from east to west The skies are darken'd by ascending smoke, For every valley is an altar made, Where unto Mammon and to all the gods Of man's idolatry, the victims we are. Missouri's floods are ruffled as by storm, And Hudson's rugged hills at midnight glow By light of man-projected meteors— We feed ten-thousand fires! In one short day The woodland growth of centuries is consumed, Our crackling limbs the pond'rous hammer rouse, With fervent heat—Tormented by our flame Fierce vapours struggling hiss on every hand— On Erie's shores—by dusky Arkansaw Our ranks are falling like the golden grain In harvest time on Wolga's banks remote— A few short years these valleys greenly clad, These slumbering mountains resting in our arms, Shall naked gleam beneath the scorching sun; And all their wimpling rivulets be dry— No more the deer these bosky dells shall haunt Nor squirrel curious chatter near his store— A few short years! Our ancient race shall be Like scatter'd Israel's 'mid the tribes of man— It ceas'd, that voice,—my answer was in tears. Catskill 1838 47. The Lament of the Forest In joyous Summer, when the exulting earth Flung fragrance from innumerable flowers Through the wide wastes of heaven, as on she took In solitude her everlasting way, I stood among the mountain heights, alone! The beauteous mountains, which the voyager On Hudson's breast far in the purple west Magnificent beholds; the abutments broad Whence springs the immeasurable dome of heaven. A lake was spread before me, so serene That I had deemed it heaven with silver clouds, Had not the drowning butterfly, on wing Of skimming swallow, ever and anon Wrinkled its glorious face with spreading rings. It was Earth's offering to the imperial sky That in their rugged palms the mountains held Aloft. Around it rose precipitous steeps, With rock, and crag, and dell, and cavern dank; Which seemed an amphitheatre hugely built By mighty Titans when the world was young; And though the Flood o'erwhelmed the builders, hurled Downward its loftiest battlements, and crushed The massive seats, columns and arches vast; Silent and desolate, it rears on high A thousand Colosseums heaped in one! Forests of shadowy pine, hemlock and beech, And oak and maple ever beautiful, O'er every rent and boss of ruin spread, Rank above rank arrayed: the topmost pines Quivered among the clouds, and on the lake, Peaceful and calm, the lower woods looked down, A silent people through the lapsing years. Beside that lake I lingered long, like one Who gazes on the face of her he loves, Entranced in thoughts too glad for utterance. I watched the breeze upon the mountain's breast Toss the green pine and birchen foliage gray: The clouds, like angels on their heavenward flight, Inhaled the perfume from the azalea's flower, And small white violet, whose honied breath Made the air sweet, and marked the wavelets break, Casting the pollen of the rifled flowers In mimic rage, like gold-dust, on the shores. The sun descended, and the twilight spread Its soft empurpled wings; and that blessed hour, When spirits stooping from the crimson clouds Commune with man, whose grovelling instincts now Are laid aside as robes of earthliness By Nature's pure and solitary fount. Over my senses stole a sweet repose, And dreams, which are but wakefulness of soul— A brief exemption from encumbering clay. I heard a sound! 'Twas wild and strange; a voice As of ten thousand! Musical it was— A gush of richest concord, deep and slow; A song that filled the universal air! It was the voice of the great Forest, sent From every valley and dark mountain top Within the bosom of this mighty land. Lament “Mortal, whose love for our umbrageous realms Exceeds the love of all the race of man; Whom we have loved; for who have opened wide With welcome our innumerable arms; Open thine ears! The voice that ne'er before Was heard by living man, is lifted up, And fills the air—the voice of our complaint. Thousands of years!—yea, they have passed away As drops of dew upon the sunlit rose, Or silver vapors of the summer sea; Thousands of years! like wind-strains on the harp, Or like forgotten thoughts, have passed away Unto the bourne of unremembered things. Thousands of years! When the fresh earth first broke Through chaos, swift in new-born joy even then The stars of heaven beheld us waving high Upon the mountains, slumbering in the vales: Or yet the race of man had seen their light, Before the virgin breast of earth was scarred By steel, or granite masses rent from rocks To build vast Thebes or old Persepolis, Our arms were clasped around the hills, our locks Shaded the streams that loved us, our green tops Were resting places for the weary clouds. Then all was harmony and peace; but Man Arose—he who now vaunts antiquity— He the destroyer—and in the sacred shades Of the far East began destruction's work. Echo, whose voice had answered to the call Of thunder or of winds, or to the cry Of cataracts—sound of sylvan habitants Or song of birds—uttered responses sharp And dissonant; the axe unresting smote Our revered ranks, and crashing branches lashed The ground, the mighty trunks, the pride of years, Rolled on the groaning earth with all their umbrage. Stronger than wintry blasts, and gathering strength, Swept that tornado, stayless, till the Earth, Our ancient mother, blasted lay and bare Beneath the burning sun. The little streams That oft had raised their voices in the breeze In joyful unison with ours, did waste And pine as if in grief that we were not. Our trackless shades, our dim ubiquity, In solemn garb of the primeval world, Our glory, our magnificence, were gone; And but on difficult places, marsh or steep, The remnants of our failing race were left, Like scattered clouds upon the mountain-top. The vast Hyrcanian wood, and Lebanon's Dark ranks of cedar were cut down like grass; And man, whose poets sang our happy shades, Whose sages taught that Innocence and Peace, Daughters of Solitude, sojourned in us, Held not his arm, until Necessity, Stern master e'en of him, seized it and bound, And from extinction saved our scanty tribes. “Seasons there were, when man, at war with man, Left us to raze proud cities, desolate Old empires, and pour out his blood on soil That once was all our own. When death has made All silent, all secure, we have returned, Twisted our roots around the prostrate shafts And broken capitals, or struck them deep Into the mould made richer by man's blood. Such seasons were but brief: so soon as earth Was sanctified again by shade and art, Again resolved to nature, man came back, And once more swept our feeble hosts away. “Yet was there one bright, virgin continent Remote, that Roman name had never reached, Nor ancient dreams, in all their universe; As inaccessible in primal time To human eye and thought, as Uranus Far in his secret void. For round it rolled A troubled deep, whose everlasting roar Echoed in every zone; whose drear expanse Spread dark and trackless as the midnight sky; And stories of vast whirlpools, stagnant seas, Terrible monsters, that with horror struck The mariner's soul, these held aloof full long The roving race of Europe from that land, The land of beauty and of many climes, The land of mighty cataracts, where now Our own proud eagle flaps his chainless wing. “Thus guarded through long centuries, untouched By man, save him, our native child, whose foot Disdained the bleak and sun-beat soil, who loved Our shafted halls, the covert of the deer, We flourished, we rejoiced. From mountain top To mountain top we gazed, and over vales And glimmering plains we saw our banner green Wide waving yet untorn. Gladly the Spring On bloomy wing shed fragrance over us; And Summer laughed beneath our verdant roof, And Autumn sighed to leave our golden courts; And when the crimson leaves were strewn in showers Upon the ample lap of Oregon, Or the great Huron's lake of lazuli, Winter upraised his rude and stormy songs, And we in a wild chorus answered him. O prince primeval! would thou hadst remained! What moved thee to unbar thine emerald gates, O mighty Deep! when the destroyer came? Strayed then thy blasts upon Olympus' air, Or were they lulled to breezes round the brow Of rich Granada's crafty conqueror, When with strong wing they should have rushed upon Our enemy and smitten him, as when The fleet of Xerxes on the Grecian coast Was cast like foam and weed upon the rocks! “But impotent the voice of our complaint: He came! Few were his numbers first, but soon The work of desolation was begun Close by the heaving main; then on the banks Of rivers inland far, our strength was shorn, And fire and steel performed their office well. No stay was there—no rest. The tiny cloud Oft seen in torrid climes, at first sends forth A faint light breeze; but gathering as it moves, Darkness and bulk, it spans the spacious sky With lurid palm, and sweeps stupendous o'er The crashing world. And thus comes rushing on This human hurricane, boundless as swift. Our sanctuary, this secluded spot, Which the stern rocks have guarded until now, Our enemy has marked. This gentle lake Shall lose our presence in its limpid breast, And from the mountains we shall melt away, Like wreaths of mist upon the winds of heaven. Our doom is near: behold from east to west The skies are darkened by ascending smoke; Each hill and every valley is become An altar unto Mammon, and the gods Of man's idolatry—the victims we. Missouri's floods are ruffled as by storm, And Hudson's rugged hills at midnight glow By light of man-projected meteors. We feed ten thousand fires: in our short day The woodland growth of centuries is consumed; Our crackling limbs the ponderous hammer rouse With fervent heat. Tormented by our flame, Fierce vapors struggling hiss on every hand. On Erie's shores, by dusky Arkansas, Our ranks are falling like the heavy grain In harvest-time on Wolga's distant banks. “A few short years!—these valleys, greenly clad, These slumbering mountains, resting in our arms, Shall naked glare beneath the scorching sun, And all their wimpling rivulets be dry. No more the deer shall haunt these bosky glens, Nor the pert squirrel chatter near his store. A few short years!—our ancient race shall be, Like Israel's, scattered 'mong the tribes of men.” [48. Oft when o'er Earth is spread the gloomy shade] Oft when o'er Earth is spread the gloomy shade Of wintry clouds, the ever mournful wind Sighs like some Ghost that through the forest-glade Seeketh the quiet it can never find: So sad, so lost, at times man's spirit flies From thought to thought yet findeth no relief, O'ercast by mortal cares that thickening rise, And Nature all does minister to grief— O power divine! in such relentless hour Upon benighted souls thy blessed sunshine pour. [1838] [49. Why do ye count your little months, your years] Why do ye count your little months, your years, Or e'en your ages? They are nought: they are The measure of your feeble breath, your fears. Ye are as misers, hoarding up with care A glittering mass, a cold insensate dust, That ne'er to spirit can be changed: nor gold, Nor years are chattles of the soul; they rust, Or perish: her possession is the trust In God; the love which tongue hath never told; And immortality which death shall soon unfold. December 26, 1839 [50. Upon the bosom of the infant year] Upon the bosom of the infant year, Our First-born! Thou wert brought to earth The New Year rose—the day-dawn did appear, And thou dids't breath the breath of life—Thy birth, The mighty Year's—the Days coeval were— Auspiciously thy earthly race begun: No common natal hour was thine, my son!— Thy name too hath a meaning “Theodore,” The “Gift of God,” that I would ne'er forget; And may the giver on the gift outpour His choicest blessings, and before thee set His shield; so, in the world's tumultuous roar Thou shalt be strengthened, and sin's arrows fall Innocuous—thy virtue conquering all— If 'tis thy lot to live through many years And this the utterance of a parent's love Should merit thy gaze—think, think what anxious fears What hopes, thy Mother's breast and mine did move, As watching thee with tenderness and tears We looked into the future, knowing well That in the world, sorrow and sin do dwell. And may the love which now I would express Bring to thine eyes a tear—strength to thy mind To battle with temptation—onward press In virtue's path, even for our sakes, and find In our fond love a cause for lovingness; And prove my son, when earth's dark vale is trod, Thou wert indeed the very “Gift of God.” January 1, 1840 51. The Dial Gray hairs, unwelcome monitors, begin To mingle with the locks that shade my brow And sadly warn me that I stand within That pale uncertain called the middle age. Upon the billow's head which soon must bow I reel; and gaze into the depths where rage No more the wars 'twixt Time and Life as now, And gazing swift, descend towards that great Deep Whose secrets the Almighty one doth keep. I am as one on mighty errand bound Uncertain is the distance—fixed the hour; He stops to gaze upon the Dial's round Trembling and earnest; when a rising cloud Casts its oblivious shadow and no more The gnomon tells us what he would know and loud Thunders are heard and gathering tempests lower. Lamenting misspent time he hastes away And treads again the dim and dubious way. February 1, 1840 52. Birdsnest On topmost bough swinging in every blast Of Winter's chilliest, keenest breath there hung A Birdsnest, which nor wind nor hail had cast From the tough twigs to which it firmly clung. No twittering such as in the summer's day I oft have lingering listened to was heard; But it was empty torn and bleak and gray The airy cradle of the happy bird. Far with the summer fled the birdlets gay Which in that cradle were so fondly tended, In some unknown and sunnier land they play Mid bowers where buds and fruits are sweetly blended. In some far land unknown! Alas! How like the Hopes my youthful bosom bred; No mother's care, no love could mine surpass; But like the birds when winter came they fled, And left my heart, where they were fondly nursed Empty and hollow, like yon tossing nest Sheltering no more nor sheltered from the burst Of stormy life is now my barren breast. But I will not repine, Summer will come Again to bless these groves, again her nest The bird will build, so let th' unfading bloom Of Hope surround my idly tortured breast— Cedar Grove [Catskill] February, 1840 [53. Though snows enwrap the mountain's head] Though snows enwrap the mountain's head Yet round our feet bright flowers are spread: O, thus in life may ever be Sorrow afar—and Joy with thee— Maria this fond wish of mine Springs from a love that would entwine All which is beautiful around Thy heart in lasting verdure bound. But sad experience checks the wing Of Hope—here no eternal Spring Gladdens the ever changing earth; Perennial Summer never yet had birth. I may not hope that life shall be A lasting sunshine, even to thee: Clouds, cold and darkness must descend, And sorrow's self thy anxious spirit bend— But when life's darkest shadow lays Upon thy heart, may cheering rays Of holy hope from out the darkness rise— A faithful promise of eternal joys— Thomas Cole May 10, 1840 54. Birthday Thy birthday comes when the meads Their rich encumbrance to the scythe have given And tempt to wander when the twilight spreads Her azure mantle over the earth and heaven. Amid the glory of the orbed year The star that rules my heart did first appear. It was a day of deep import to me When thou wert born, unconscious though I dwelt In Youth's unthinking maze. Each hour we see Weaves in our destiny unseen, unfelt Some chain of light or shade which shall be found Forever more about our being bound. August 3, 1840 55. The Summer Days are Ended Summer is gone! The summer days are ended! A voice mysterious sounded through my ear; As o'er the hills and through the vales I wended Rejoicing in the glory of the year. I paused to listen to the plaint of sadness It was the wailing of the Autumn wind; Quick fled my breast its joy and gladness And sorrow cloud-like brooded o'er my mind. Wide spread the scene; beauty was still around And more than beauty; for the glowing earth In regal crimson and in gold was bound; And every tree and lowly shrub gave birth To tents that evening's sun-lit dome no dye Ethereal shows, their richness could outvie. I looked into the heavens and they were deep, Deep as the soul—unfathomed but by God; A lonely cloud the western gate did keep As the tired sun night's dusky threshold trod. The Autumn sky spotless pure is fraught With melancholy—wild and wandering thought Pierces the vault; beauty does but veil The shoreless sea where Doubt and Wonder sail. There can be gloom in palaces of splendour Sorrow may dwell the brightest smile beneath So nature throws a gorgeous robe around her When chill'd by Winter's sudden grasp of death. The daylight vanished from the mountain's head The round moon shone upon the waving woods And all was silent save the voice that said With mournful cadence like far-falling floods “Summer is gone! The Summer days are ended!” Ere with slow feet my homeward path I wended. A few short days had passed and forth once more I ventured for the fresh and healthful air; I trod the hills and vallies as before; The vales were cheerless and the hills were bare. The wintry blast With ruffian hands had torn The robe that Earth had worn In fragments cast It on the miry ground—the floods; And ruthless shook the loud lamenting woods. The floods were riotous and spread Their greedy arms o'er grassy plains; Tore from the husbandman his harvest grains And foaming—tossing, swiftly sped Down the terrific steep And plunged in ocean's all-devouring deep. Cease! cease proud Floods your laughter Your sorrowing shall come after. Stern Frost shall forge your chain See now upon the winged North he comes! Strong strong as Death! Your struggles vain As ghosts unblest among deserted tombs With long low smothered groans ye shall complain. From the deep glen up starts the hoary cliff Like a grim giant from his gloomy lair 'Waked by some fiendish scream Heard in his horrid dream Shakes from his brow the dark dishevelled hair And stares around with icy horror stiff. For round its granite head the winds are shrieking The old oaks on its breast are loudly creaking; Their leaves are shatter'd branches torn Through air tempestuously borne— From every dell and rock a voice is breaking— “Summer is gone! The summer days are ended And o'er the earth the cold dark months descended.” Yes they are fled Summer and Autumn too! But shall I grieve and sigh the Winter through? Bears he no chaplet on his barren brow? Unfading Ivy, thou dost surely know, And faithful Evergreens his temples bind; Pluck them and cast thy sadness to the wind! Beside the hearth when winter winds are wild Domestic peace and Love and Friendship mild, Those Evergreens shall bloom; they flourish best When by the storm heart nearer heart is prest. Wait God's-own seasons; it would be a curse Perennial Summer—Winter is the nurse Of Virtue—'Tis the time to intertwine Holy affections and to look within The Soul—to strive and win from Time A wreath that blights nor withers by the change of clime. Thos. Cole 1840 56. The Summer Days Are Ended “Summer is gone!—the summer days are ended!” A voice mysterious struck my wakeful ear, As o'er the hills and through the vales I wended, Rejoicing in the glory of the year. I paused to listen to that plaint of sadness; It was the wailing of the Autumn-wind: Quick fled my breast its airy joy and gladness, And sorrow, cloud-like, brooded o'er my mind. Wide spread the scene: beauty was still around, And more than beauty; for the glowing earth In regal crimson and in gold was bound; And evening's colors of ethereal birth, Were dull, compared with lowly shrub and tree, Whose hues gushed forth, a fount of harmony. I looked into the heavens, and they were deep, Deep as the soul; unfathomed, save by God; A lonely cloud the western gate did keep As the tired sun Night's dusky threshold trod. The Autumn sky, spotless and pure, is fraught With melancholy: wild and wandering Thought Pierces the vault; and Beauty does but veil The shoreless sea, where Doubt and Wonder sail. There can be gloom in palaces of splendor— Sorrow may dwell the brightest smile beneath; So Nature throws a gorgeous robe around her, When chilled by Winter's sudden grasp of death. The daylight vanished from the mountain's head; The round moon shone upon the waving woods, And all was silent, save the voice that said, With mournful cadence, like far-falling floods: “Summer is gone!—the summer days are ended!” Ere with slow feet my homeward path I wended. A few short days had passed, and forth once more I ventured for the fresh and healthful air: I trod the hills and valley as before; The vales were cheerless, and the hills were bare: The wintry blast, With ruffian hands, had torn The robe that Earth had worn; In fragments cast It on the miry ground, the floods; And ruthless shook the loud-lamenting woods. The floods were riotous, and spread Their greedy arms o'er grassy plains— Tore from the husbandman his harvest grains, And foaming, tossing, swiftly sped Down the terrific steep, And plunged in Ocean's all-devouring deep. Cease! cease, proud Floods! your laughter, Your sorrowing shall come after! Stern Frost shall forge your chain: See now upon the wingèd North he comes, Strong, strong as Death! Your struggles vain! As ghosts unblessed among deserted tombs, With long, low-smothered groans, shall ye complain! From the dusk glen up starts the hoary Cliff, Like a grim giant from his gloomy lair, Waked by some fiendish scream, Heard in his horrid dream, Shakes from his brow the dark dishevelled hair, And stares around, with icy horror stiff: For round its granite head the winds are shrieking, The old oaks on its breast are harshly creaking; Their leaves and clinging branches torn, Through air tempestuously borne: From every dell and rock a voice is breaking: “Summer is gone!—the summer days are ended, And o'er the earth the cold dark months descended!” Yes, they are gone! Summer and Autumn too! But shall I therefore sigh the winter through? Bears he no chaplet on his frosty brow? Unfading Ivy, thou dost surely know, And faithful Evergreens, his temples bind; Pluck them, and cast thy sorrows to the wind! Beside the hearth, when winter winds are wild, Domestic peace, and love, and friendship mild, Those evergreens, shall bloom; they flourish best When by the storm heart nearer heart is prest. Wait God's own seasons; it would be a curse, Perennial Summer: Winter is the nurse Of Virtue: 'tis the hour to intertwine Holy affections, and to look within The soul; to strive to win from Time A wreath that withers not by change of clime. 57. Written upon an Autumnal Leaf I wish not for the Sybyll's power To write the dread decrees of fate— Should not unveil the future hour The good or ill that on it wait— But if the mighty skill was mine To guide the wheels of destiny Maria, no fond wish of thine But amply should be granted thee. [1840] 58. On Another Beauty doth fade—its emblem is a leaf That mingles with the earth in quick decay But virtue like an exaltation bright Springeth from each to heaven and never dies— Beauty doth fade—as fades the leaf Its summer day is bright but brief But virtue like a star on high Shines on through all eternity— [1840] [59. Like a cloud on the brow of a mountain] Like a cloud on the brow of a mountain When the sun in his glory doth rise; Like the spray of the far-falling fountain That ascendeth so swift toward the skies Like the infant's gay laugh—like the blush On the virgin's soft cheek—like the flush Of the floweret that withers anon Is the year; Yea! the year that is gone. For the cloud it hath vanished away Dispersed by the power of the sun And dissolved in the air is the spray E're the blue heights of heaven it had won; And now transient the laugh of the child And the blush on the virgin's soft cheek And the flower is of beauty despoiled E'er another bright morning can break. Like such is the year; it has wings That bore it with swiftness away And though round it our memory clings Ah! we cannot ritard it one day! It is gone O my soul! It is gone Its months, weeks and days every one. Now I turn to the fresh coming year. Shall wild Hope mount her chariot again? And rush onward with reckless carreer? And shall Fancy's bright pictures so vain Me deceive as may have done before? Strange delusions! I fear ye and strive You to cast from my soul evermore; To escape earth's enchantments and live In the bondage of truth; for the true Is the pathway, though weary and sad And so darksome and dreary to view That leads up to the world of the glad. O loved Hope that hath recreant been. Through the year and the years that are past Let my chariot wheels turn where is seen The bright gate of true glory, at last. January 1, 1841 [60. This day hath closed another of my years] This day hath closed another of my years And the red current that doth turn the wheel Of mortal life, of its appointed task This much hath well performed; to be renewed No more. I know the years my life has known I know that there has mingled in their tide The light, the dark, the painful and the glad; But when I gaze into the Future's depths And strive to learn what yet remains of life Whether of years or hours or seconds, Ah! 'Tis blank, mysterious and mortal ken Is lost in gloom. Am I disconsolate That all is dark? Oh God forbid! For though Not yet is granted prescience to man Immortal hope is given him to sustain. Who gave this being knows the time to take. That time Oh God! I wait! Grant that the hour Whene'er it come may find me trusting thee. January 31, 1841 61. Winds Winds, that come rushing o'er the distant main, Whence do you spring, and wither are ye bound? I ask in vain! And why, with ever-mournful sound, Sweep ye the restless waves, the desert rocks? I ask again: My feeble voice your ceaseless murmur mocks. Whether upon some icy mountain's head Andes or Himmalah, Roused by the sun, ye first awoke, Or on the desert grave Of Babylon or Ninevah; Or on the Dead Sea's wave Dreams of the past erst broke Your slumber first, (Its chain by Terror burst), I know not: fast ye fled, And o'er these hills I hear your hurrying tread. Ye say not whence! Can any answer give? Mysteriously ye live Amid the infinite, whose depths untold The rolling Earth in their vast bosom hold! Secret your path—unmarked your place of birth. My soul! art thou not like to these wild winds? Passing in fitful swiftness o'er the earth— A wanderer that seeks and never finds! My soul replies: “Look at the ordered skies, See how each planet keeps its glorious path— The swift-winged comets do not stray; The winds have their appointed way, And so thy spirit hath.” May, 1841 62. [Autumn] The yellow forest lies beneath the sun Quiet, although it suffereth decay The brooklet to the Ocean-deep does run With gentle lapse and silent melts away. The clouds upon the evening sky are bright But wasting mingle in the glorious light. So, may my soul in life's declining hours Like the still forest never once complain: And flow unmurmuring adown its course Like yonder brooklet to the Eternal Main; And as the clouds upon the sunset sky Be mingled with the radiance on high. 63. Autumn The yellow forest lies beneath the sun Quiet; although it sufferth decay. The brooklet to the Ocean-deep does run With gentle lapse and silent melts away: The clouds upon the evening sky are bright But wasting mingle with the glorious light.

[1842] 64. Mt. Etna Breezes and bees were sweetly murmuring And joyously like children bright, Bedecked in shining crimson, gold and white, Frolicked and danced the flowers around my feet. Those were the fields of Etna where I strayed; Those were the children of the flowers that erst Fair Proserpina into garlands wove; And where yon bubbling waters upward gush With Pluto sank the loud-lamenting maid. But these are fables and I lift my eyes That they may wander through the cloudless sky. My thoughts' companions; in that deep serene They soar away 'till in that vast profound In extacy and wonder they are lost. What cloud is that, rearing its snowy head, Dazzling and glorious in the morning sun, Whose mighty form o'ershadows half the world? No exaltation of the earth and sea; It moveth not; nor sun; nor wind disperse; Nor shatter its indissoluble mass! Etna! The fastenings of thy lofty tent Are in the rock-barred earth! Thy roots Beneath the rushing of the briny deep! In older times Charybdis furious waved And Scylla clamored, horrid, at thy feet But they are wasted by consuming time Grown old and weak; yet thou, forever young, Outlivest centuries! Beneath thy gaze Nations have birth and death. Augmenting ever, Time that doth crumble temples, pyramids; Hath watched thee grow until thy regal hand Usurps the empyrean with its starry realms. But for yon filmy smoke, that from thy crest Continual issues; there would be no sign That from thy mighty breast bursts forth at times The sulphurous storm—the avalanche of fire; That midnight is made luminous and day A ghastly twilight by thy lurid breath. By thee tormented Earth is tossed and riven; The shuddering mountains reel; temples and towers The works of man and man himself, his hopes His harvests, all, a desolation made! Sublime art thou O Mount! Whether beneath The moon in silence sleeping thy woods And driven snows, and golden fields of corn; Or bleat upon thy slant breast the gentle flocks, And shepherds in the mellow flow of eve Pipe merrily; or when thy scathed sides Are laved with fire; answered thine earthquake voice By screams and clamor of affrighted men. Lone mountain of the pallid brow and heart Of fire! Thou art a resting place for thought, Thought reaching far above thy bounds; from thee To Him who bade the central fires construct This wond'rous fabric; lifted by thy dread brow To meet the sun while yet the earth is dark, And ocean with its ever murmuring waves. [May, 1842] 65. Lago Maggiore O sky and earth! How ye are linked together Upon the bosom of this gentle lake; The wild and wandering breeze is doubtful whether It may your calm and sweet communion break. 'Tis thus within my silent bosom mingle The memory of distant scenes—my home And these enchanting prospects; whilst I, single Companionless, in pensive thought do roam. The distant and the present sometimes meet In dream-like hues; but dark thoughts quickly rise And mar the mirror of the vision sweet And truth overwhelmeth with a sad surprise: 'Twixt me and those I love an ocean lies And all the glory of the landscape dies. June 14, 1842 66. Life's Pilgrimage Pilgrim down Life's perilous way Let thy steps be cautious ever; For not always is it day, Sunlight shineth not forever. Darkness, oftimes, shall surround thee Unexpected night shall fall Meteor's dazzling glare confound thee, Lightening's keen thy soul appal. Strange the road abrupt and broken, Ridges, gulfs on every hand Nought the danger to foretoken Till upon the brink thou stand. On the whirlwinds of the mountains Ghastly phantoms fiercely drive, In the spray of tortured fountains Demons hideously live. Has the floweret's beauty won thee In the gleam of April-day; Or the rainbow spread before thee; Let them tempt thee not to stray. Should whispering groves, or banks of moss, Sweet, invite thee to repose; Sleep would bring thee heavy loss, Thou art in the midst of foes. Wary be the Pilgrim ever, Firm of heart; though weak of limb; For the body conquers never, Spirit gains the flight for him. Though the frame through pain is wasting; Or in health 'twould lingering stay; Still the soul is onward hasting: Time hath never known delay. Healthful, sickly, buoyant, weary, Soothed or tossed by joy or ill; Heartless, mirthful, tearful dreary; Downward treads the Pilgrim still. Downward till the pathway endeth On a shattered precipice; Far beneath in gloom extendeth Death's dark shadowy abyss. Deep the gloom of that dread valley Thought its depth can never find; But returneth from the sally Doleful as the winter-wind. Off the Pilgrim wildly starteth; He would fly but turns in vain, From the craggy shore he parteth, Plunges ne'er to ride again. “Is Life's journey then so fearful? With such perils who shall cope? Desolate and dark and tearful Whence shall spring the Pilgrim's hope? “When unto the gloomy valley He is worn and weary come What his fainting spirits rally If the grave must be his home?” Pilgrim on Life's perilous way Keep thy steadfast eye toward Heaven. 'Mid thy perils night and day, Strength to meet them shall be given. Peace of heart and holy gladness From above shall oft descend; With the deepest of thy sadness Hope the comforter shall blend. Angel forms shall hover round thee And my footsteps gently lead; Though thick darkness shall surround thee Safely, surely, shalt thou tread. So, when reached that valley fearful On that precipice's brink Not with shudderings and tearful Shall thy heart within thee sink. For with brightening eye uplifted Gazing o'er the Gulf profound; Through the clouds dispersed and drifted, By a light that shines beyond. Thou shalt see angelic creatures Clad in sunny splendor stand, Smiles on their celestial features, Calling thee to that bright land. January 1, 1843 67. A Sunset I saw a glory in the etherial deep; A Glory such as from the higher heaven Must have descended. Earth does never keep In its embrace such beauty. Clouds were driven As by the breath of God into strange forms Unearthly, and did burn with living flames And hues so bright, so wonderful and rare That mortal language cannot give them names: And light and shadow strangely linked their arms In lovliness; and all continual were In change; and with each change there came new charms. Nor orient pearls, nor flowers alive with dew, Nor golden tinctures, nor the insect's wing, Nor dyes purpureal for imperial view Nor all that Art creates, or mortals bring Can e'er compare with what the heavens unfurled. These are the wings of Angels! I exclaimed, Stretched in their mystic beauty o'er the world! Let us give thanks to God that in his love He grants such glimpses of the world above, That we poor pilgrims on this darkling sphere Beyond its shadows can our hopes uprear. Catskill October, 1843 68. On a Sunset Sky I saw a glory in the sunset deep; A glory such as from the highest Heaven Must have descended. Earth does never keep In its embrace such beauty; Clouds were driven As by the breath of God into free forms Unearthly and did burn with living flames And hues so wonderful, so bright and rare That mortal language cannot give them names: And light and shadow strangely linked their arms In lovliness and all continual were Changing and with each change there came new charms. Nor orient pearls; nor flowers fresh with dew Nor golden tinctures; nor insect's wing Nor dies purpureal for imperial view; Nor all that Art or fecund Earth can bring Can aught compare with what the heavens unfurled. These are the wings of Angels I exclaimed! Stretched in their mystic beauty o'er the world! Let us give thanks to God that in his love He gives such glimpses of the world above, That we poor pilgrims on this darkling sphere Beyond its shadows can our hopes uprear. October 4, 1843 69. Winter Winter hoary, stern and strong Sits the mountain-crags among On his bleak and horrid throne Drift on drift the snow is piled Which the torturing blasts have thrown Into forms grotesque and wild— Ice-ribb'd precipices shed A cold light o'er his grisly head Athwart his brows gray clouds are bound Forever whirling round and round— O'er the forests wide he lays his hand And they are bare— They move and moan a spectral band Struck by despair: He breathes upon the stream, it shrinks from day And 'neath the ice-heaps seeks its dismal way. The lofty pine the Hemlock dark and vast Alone defy the cruel Despot's might. The ice-rain keen the tempest's withering blast, His slaves, assail them fiercely day and night; But towering high mid Heaven's vault they stand A firm inconquerable band— When winter closes o'er life's fitful year And time outspreads a dull and flagging wing May the Soul's Evergreens thy bosom cheer, Strong Faith and Hope that ever heavenward spring. [1843] 70. Winter Winter hoary, stern and strong Sits the mountain crags among; On his bleak and horrid throne Drift on drift the snow is piled Which the icy blasts have thrown Into forms grotesque and wild— Ice-ribb'd precipices shed Cold light o'er his grisly head; Clouds athwart his brows are bound Ever whirling round and round— O'er forests wide he lays his hand And they are bare. They move and moan a spectral band Struck by despair— He breathes upon the stream it shrinks from day And seeks 'neath heaped ice its dismal way— The lofty pine the Hemlock dark and vast Alone defy the cruel Despot's might— The ice-rain keen the Tempest's withering blast, His slaves, assail them day and night; But towering mid heaven's vault they stand A firm unconquerable band— When winter closes o'er life's fitful year And Time outspreads a dull and flagging wing May the soul's Evergreens thy bosom cheer Strong Faith and Hope that heav'nward spring. [1843] 71. The Voyage of Life Part One Forth through the ancient shadowy woods as one Who hath no being but his thought I wended Instinctively. The deep and solemn tone, The holy gloom harmoniously blended With musings grave and fond of Life and Death And Immortality; which waits our parting breath. I dreamed not; but before me rose a wall Of rock stupendous: crag on crag was piled In a gray mountainous heap and over all The towering ramparts shadows fell from wild Portentous clouds that ever restlessly Hid the far summits from the wondering eye. And in the bosom of that stoney pile Which seemed the ruin of a shattered world Heaped skyward by some Titan's mighty toil A cavern yawned like death and changeful curled Across its sombre arches vast and wide Pale spectral mists; as though its awful depths to hide. But yet the eye unwilling to be barred Pierced far within the antre's silent womb, Arch beyond arch with many a fissure scarred, Perceived, until impenetrable gloom Sealed unto human vision, human thought The secret things with which its depths were fraught. From the mysterious bosom of that cave A gentle river took its winding way, Reflecting freshly in the crystal wave Rocks, sky and herbage which the glancing ray Of the uprising sun made rosy light: A wreath of glory on the dewy verge of night. Murmuring it left the dim and shadowy gloom And joyous as a thing of life it flowed Where flowers in fragrant companies did bloom Bespangled all with dew and sweetly bowed Their beauteous faces o'er the placid stream, Narcissus-like involved in love's delusive dream. The song of birds uprose on every side And mingled sweetly in the jocund air That frolicked free across the dimpling tide And o'er that paradise of flowers so fair; And it did seem as though the sky and earth Sang choral hymns at some blessed Angel's birth. Gliding out from the deep recess there came A wondrous Vessel, golden was its bow, Which flashed across the waters like a flame. Of wingèd Hours the Bark was wrought—The prow A laughing form with such like intertwined; But dark confused and crowded were the shapes behind. It bore two beings; one an infant child That laughed and sported on a flowery bed; The other was a form of aspect mild; Radiant it stood and o'er its glorious head A star hung tremulous and brighter did appear Than Venus when the morn from cloud and mist is clear. Its azure wings were poised in buoyant rest As though just ceased from fanning heavenly air; One hand the Vessel's rudder graceful pressed, The other stretched with most benignant care O'er the child. It was a beauteous form and face Such like doth meet at Heaven's Gate the soul that findeth grace. “What meaneth this,” with earnest voice I cried, “The landscape bright, the river's flow serene, And those two Voyagers—” My soul replied: “Life hath her pictures of each varied scene The mortal pilgrim sees, wrought on the heart In colors clear and strong that never can depart. “Experience is the artist and she toils Incessantly with ever painful care; Whether beneath the sun the landscape smiles Or storms obscure; the lights and shades are there; But Reason, Passion, Prejudice and Time Do give the after-tone discordant or sublime. “By thee now standing midway on the height Of contemplation not alone are seen Pictures of the departing past; but sight Of future scenes is opened through a screen Of darkling clouds and mists fantastic lies Across the tearful vision of thy longing eyes. “By mortal man that River of dark source Is named the ‘Stream of Life’; with constant flow With many a winding on its downward course, At times it lags along with motion slow, At times impetuous o'er the rocky steep It journeyeth onward toward The Eternal Deep. “There in that vast Profound—that darkest Dread That Silence—that immeasurable Gloom, The Breathless—Shoreless—the Un-islanded Of the great World—of mighty Time the Tomb It sinks, it vanishes and mortal eye Perplexed and troubled, trembling turns on high. “But human thought, thanks be to God, can soar Triumphant on the wings of light divine And take its flight above the Shadow hoar; Where Angels in a land of beauty shine In living light which is the Light of Light, The everlasting day, that suffereth not the night. “Thou wert such infant Voyager, all men Have been—the thousands yet unborn will be Cast in such mould and of such origin Mysterious to themselves and even he Who bore our sorrows; for us shed his blood Was launched in that strange Bark and sailed the mystic flood. “Know! innocence enshrines the infant-heart Its tears are but as dew drops freshening joy; For withering sin, as yet, can claim no part Nor pale remorse bedim the beaming eye. Children are buds of Heaven 'tis earthly air That breeds the cankers, guilt and deadening despair. “They have their Angels. Yonder dazzling shape That steers the richly freighted bark is one Of those who ‘minister’ and constant keep A watch around us, leave us not alone From infancy to age, whether is clear the sky; Or robed in thunder-clouds dark demons hover high. “We see them not with our dull mortal eyes, Yet as Zephyr bears the thistle's down; Or summer clouds in the cerulean skies, About us their immaculate arms are thrown, And nought but Giant Sin can drag us thence Who grows and conquers by our disobedience.” “O Soul!” I cried! “Why linger not the Hours In that blest clime of innocence? Why flowed The stream so swiftly through the land of flowers? Why did we leave Life's highest hill that glowed 'Mid light celestial? Where the breezes blow Direct from Heaven, and seek these darker vales below?” “A higher destiny is thine,” replied My soul “through trial, sorrow, darkness, pain The road to far sublimer joys does lead And lasting bliss by suffering we gain And by the gloomy vale through which we tread We reach the bliss that makes all earthly joy seem dead.” Part Two As the broad mountain where the shadows flit Of clouds dispersing in the summer-breeze; Or like the eye of one who high does sit On Taormina's antique height and sees The fiery Mount afar, the Ruin near at hand, The flowers, the purple waves that wash the golden strand. So changed my thought from light to shade; At times exulting in the glow of hope, at times In darkness cast by what my soul had said; 'Till sunk in reverie her words seemed chimes From some far tower, that tell of mystial joy, Or knell that fills the air as with a lingering sigh. Again I raised my downcast eyes to look Upon the scene so beautiful when lo! The stream no longer from the cavern took Its gentle way 'tween flowery banks and low But through a landscape varied, rich and vast Beneath a sky that dusky cloud had surely never passed. Wide was the river; with majestic flow And pomp and power it swept the curving banks Like some great conqueror whose march is slow Through tributary lands; while the abasèd ranks, Shrinking give back on either hand o'erawed As though they trembling felt the presence of a God. And like some Wizard's mirror, that displays The Macrocosm, it did reflect the sky, Rocks, lawns and mountains with their purple haze, And living things, the filmy butterfly, The trembling fawn that drinks, the fluttering dove And the triumphant eagle soaring far above. And trees like those which spread their pleasant shade O'er the green slopes of Eden, and the bowers Of the once sinless pair, soft, intermingling made Stood on each shore with branches lifted high And caught eolian strains that wandered from the sky. Far, far away the shining river sped Toward the etherial mountains which did close Fold beyond fold until they vanished In the horizon's silver, whence uprose A structure strangely beautiful and vast Which every earthly fane Egyptian, Gothic, Greek, surpassed. It seemed a gorgeous palace in the sky Such as the glad sun builds above the deep On summer-eve and lighteth dazzlingly, Where towering clouds climb up the azure steep And pinnacles on pinnacles fantastic rise And ever-changing charm the wondering eyes. There, rank o'er rank that climbed the crystal air In horizontal majesty, were crossed The multitudinous shafts, or ranged afar Till in the blue perspective they were lost, And arches linked with arches stretched along Like to the mystic measures of an antique song. An antique song whose half-discovered sense Seems to spring forth from depths, as yet, unknown And fills the heart with wonder and suspense Until to thrilling rapture it is grown; Breathless we listen to each wandering strain And when the numbers cease, we listen still again. Above the columned pile sublimely rose A Dome stupendous; like the moon it shone When first upon the orient sky she glows And moves along the Ocean's verge alone; And yet beyond, above, another sphere And yet another, vaster, dimly did appear. As though the blue supernal space were filled With towers and temples, which the eye intent Piercing the filmy atmosphere that veiled, From glorious dome to dome rejoicing went, And the deep folds of ether were unfurled To show the splendors of a higher world. But from the vision of the upper air My eye descended to the lucid stream; The wingèd Boat—the Voyagers were there; But the fair Infant of my earlier dream Now stood a Youth on manhood's verge, his eye Flashing with confidence and hot expectancy. Was lifted toward the sky-encastled scene, His hand had grasped the helm once gently held By that Angelic figure so serene, And eager stretching toward the scene beheld, His bosom heaved as if with secret powers Possessed to tread the deep—to outstrip the flying Hours. With face benignant yet impinged with sorrow, As oft the sky of eve by melancholy cloud Which though it doth forbode a stormy morrow Is not less beautiful, the Angel stood Upon the bank as from the Boat just freed And waved her graceful hand and bade the Youth “God Speed.” As one emerging from some misty vale Meets the glad splendor of the rising sun; Or mariner who the wintry sea doth sail Through opening wrack beholds the harbor won, So did I gaze upon the charming scene And in my joy forgot the vision Infantine. When thus the Voice in plantive accents mild: “Ah simple mortal Earth has many a show That passes quickly—thou a credulous child, All men are children and they thoughtless go Through life's strange vale lingering by every flower Forgetful life is labor and its term an hour. “The scene before thee beautiful and bright Is but a phantasm of Youth's heated brain And doomed to fade as day before the night; Fleeting its glory, transitory, vain; Save that it teaches the meek humble soul Earth's grandeur ne'er should be the spirit's Goal. “Not that the earth foundationless is laid, An unsubstantial thing, a cloud, a mist; But 'tis a darkling soil wherein the seed Of Virtue planted, tended may subsist And washed by many tears may grow To more enduring beauty than these gauds below. “But mark the Youth, how filled his eager eye With the bright exaltation.—See! he aims To reach the portal of the palace high Above whose cloudy arch resplendant flames The tempting semblance of a conqueror's crown And wreath to bind the brows of him who wins renown. “And while he gazes greater glories rise Higher yet higher; ardent young desire With telescopic vision fills the skies. Gay are the banks in verdurous attire And swift the river floweth toward his hope The palace stands beyond, reached by a gentle slope. “Weak and deluded one! Dost thou not know Thy Bark is hasting down the Stream of Life And tarries not for any golden show In pleasure's gardens though with beauty rife! So doth the comet pass the planets by Nor rests; but speeds on its appointed destiny. “Does not thine eye perceive that when yon towers Are well nigh gained with sudden sweep the stream, And growing swiftness, shoots away and pours Impetuous, towards a shadowy ravine deep Cleft in the mountain's vast and misty side As though it eager sought its thwarted floods to hide.” The voice had paused: “And is it thus” I cried, “That Youth's fond hopes must ever pass away; As empty dreams, untouched unsatisfied: Why leaves the Angel on his dangerous way The Voyager? That hand divine could steer The willing Boat to where yon glittering domes uprear. “And lingering by these fresh and verdant shores E'en youth might live a long long life of joy And shun perchance the torrent where it pours Adown yon dread descent.” To which reply Came quickly, “Shrouded as now thou art in earth Thou canst not see the end for which came mortal birth. “In the Almighty mind the secret cause is laid; This must thou learn, that our brief mortal life Nor rests nor lingers; nor is checked nor stayed By human skill or might howe'er so rife; Nor is it in an Angel's godlike power To lengthen out its wasting thread one single hour. “Through feeble Infancy is steered the Bark of Life By Angel hands; but growing man demands The helm in confidence and dares the strife Of the far-sweeping waves. The lurking sands, The rapids foaming through the channel dim, The roaring cataract are all unknown to him. “Wisdom is born of sorrow and of care And from man's conflicts with the world arise A sense of weakness and of chilling fear And driven from earth his hopes ascend the skies. Thus is he launched upon the stream alone To chasten pride and give young desire a holier tone. “He is alone; but still deserted never The Angel yet shall watch his perilous way; And though the clouds of earth may seem to sever, Still through the darkness shines the Angelic ray; And in the hour of midnight o'er the deep The Guardian Spirit kind will constant vigil keep.” Part Three Those closing accents fell upon my ear Sweetly as dew upon the drooping flower For in my thoughts were knit suspense and fear Which grew to hope transmuted by their power, So the first breeze of Spring upon the hills With sighs awakes the buds and frees the ice-bound rills. In gentle reverie my mind reposed When lo! The vision changed—A dismal vale— Its sides down stooping into night were bossed With jagged rocks—above huge crags rose pale And quivering in thick turbulent air Like hell-affrighted spectres starting from their lair. It seemed the Earthquake there had oped his jaws And fierce Convulsion rent the ribs of Earth; Darkness and light forgot their ancient laws. It was a den where demons had their birth Where voices strange and many a dusky form Smote the strained ear and did the sky deform. And down this valley's gulphy depths profound; Where resting place is none; nor green retreat; Where fear and death forever hover round, On every blast their restless pinions beat; The river of my Vision took its way And left far, far behind the golden light of day. Onward it dashed and with a tyrannic force Swept o'er the fractured rocks and foamed and fell And reeled from side to side with thunders hoarse: Though broken off and baffled naught could quell:— Athwart the steep the streaming floods did pour And rocky fragments fell, dislodged amid the roar. On a swift curve, a verge of glossy green, Such Niagaras where its waters leap The dizzy precipice, the Boat was seen Fleet as a meteor thwart the midnight deep. Like famished wolves when the scared prey is nigh, The pale demoniac floods roared louder as for joy. No more youth's sunshine like a halo spread Around the Voyager's high imperial brow; But Care's wan shadow settled on his head As clouds their gloom upon the mountain throw. His now the middle age when human thought Ascends her highest tower with rich experience fraught. So have we seen in some dense city's way A frantic steed dash through the affrighted crowd With his pale rider—to and fro they sway With headlong speed mid shrieks and clamor loud 'Till by a sudden plunge he disappears.— In dumb suspense we stand and quake with horrid fears. “What now can save?” I cried. O ever blind But to the present and the mask of things Was quick replied: “Doubter! Thou yet mayest find That what appears the greatest evil brings Supremest good as blackest storms and rain Bring freshness, beauty, glory in their passing train. “Behold the Guardian Angel sitteth yet Benignant 'mong the stormy clouds aloft Kindling their blackness; like a Glory set By God in midnight space—A sun whose soft Unbroken light illumes some lonely sphere That travelleth through depths of trackless ether drear. “She waits with joy the prayer which heavenward now The Voyager uplifts—Faith's earnest cry: For rescued by that act the floods below With all their fury; nor the tempest nigh; Nor ocean, seen afar have power to harm; Nor yet yon Demon Shapes terrific cause alarm. “This is the crisis—this the decisive hour In life's swift fever—balance Life and Death. Adversity's cold storm and Sorrow's power Temptation desperate with changeful breath Break with unmitigated fury on the Man, And Pleasure once so fair is sicklied o'er and wan. “And earthly hopes are wrecked and cherished joy; And friends estranged; or turned to foes; or gone Youth's crown of Glory faded and for aye: O'er Earth o'er Heaven a dusky pall is thrown: Affection's treasured things are found to fly Sink in the silent tomb, or vanish witheringly. “Young Love's delicious river soon ran dry And wasted in life's wilderness of drought; Ambition that once filled the ample sky Was but a dazzling cloud with tempest fraught: All, perished in the World or lost in Death As wastes in frosty air the warm and vaporous breath. “The heart doth suffer violence, racked and riven By the relentless blasts of earthly ill. Burthened with sin all vainly hath it striven Like a huge oak upon a wind-swept hill As tortured branches lash the Autumnal gale And struggling yield their umbrage with a lengthened wail. “But as the Spring, the gentle Spring, draws nigh To warm its mighty heart and swell its buds To lift its fragrance and to beautify; So through the Voyager's breast, amid these floods, A living warmth shall steal and prayer shall rise And yon attendant Spirit waft it to the skies. “The Guardian watches yet the weltering bark O'er the vexed floods adown the dizzy steep Through rock-ribbed channels hideous and dark Safely to guide him toward yon Ocean deep Whose darkly boundless waves eternal silence keep.” My Teacher! Guide! Thou who hast kindly read The meaning of these wondrous scenes to me Still my heart trembles, like a fragile reed By the lone shore where stamps the angry sea, This is a fearful-over-perilous way To lead but to yon Ocean's misty horror gray. And must the Voyager, these perils past Dwell ever on that vast and gloomy main, And on its lethean bosom dull be cast, Dreamless, eternally to sleep? Then vain Would seem his Birth, his Youth, his Manhood prime; Strange, useless burthens on the drooping Wings of Time. “Yet! Yet distrustful and forgetful ever Dull to the voice of wisdom! I have said, Death's pallid hand the cloudy veil shall sever And wonder Ocean widely, darkly spread, Be as a curtain quickly drawn away And open like the Morn for a surpassing day.” Part Four Struck by my Mentor's serious reply In sorrow I had clasped my hoods across My tearful eyes; yet were my tears half joy; For the quick sentence of rebuke did close With breath of kindling hope and promise bright; As broke upon the blind by Siloam's pool of light. “Behold!” the voice then said: “The closing scene Of best humanity.” The winds had ceased Their raving and the floods their roar—serene The air yet steeped in gloom as is the East When Earth's broad shadow o'er itself extends And far beneath the Main the evening sun descends. No hills of green, no gentle flowery vales No breezes fresh from out the crystal deeps No blithe birds warbling oft repeated tales; But silence, leaden silence, such as keeps The tongue fast bound the straining ear awakes As when the judge's sentence on the prisoner breaks. There, flowed the river; but with sluggish pace And met and mingled with the Ocean dun No more exulting in the headlong race; But fainting as its destined Goal was won— Last 'mid the boundless, as the single voice When crowded multitudes do suffer; or rejoice. Still the eye caught the dim and shadowy shore, The last bare headlands of the dark terrene; Herbless, desolate, glimmering and obscure; As landscape by the troubled dreamer seen, Their shattered forms down sinking one by one Into the deep of many deeps, the fathomless unknown. Oppressed I gazed: my thick and struggling sighs Or checked by the silence would have filled the air; But soon the winged Boat my eager eyes Discerned—the Man—the Tempest-tossed was there. O'er the unrippled flood with motion slow As heavy laden, sinking—sinking moved the prow. Broken that prow which once glanced o'er the stream; Its Hours ensculptured all in gold were gone, And gushed the floods through many a gaping seam: It stopped,—it settled—like a thing of stone:— Some ponderous rock that 'cross the plain is sent; Which labors on and on 'till with its labor spent. There sat the Voyager, an ancient Man, Withered and blighted by the frosts of time: Furrowed his cheek, his forehead bare and wan As though the tempests of each earthly clime Had broken o'er him in their fiercest mood And he with patient soul their fury had withstood. Then as the fulgent moon o'er ocean comes, Spreading her wings of light at eventide, I saw the Guardian's radiant flames Hush the black midnight wave and swiftly glide Through the illumined, fast dissolving wrack And by the Voyager her airy station take. The Old man saw the Spirit for the earth Was falling from his soul and from his eyes The film of blinding clay as falls the swarth Envelope from the opening bud. Surprise! O blest! To see, undreaming, spirit forms Immaculate and free from all that earth deforms. He saw the blessed Guardian of his way And knew “his Angel”; ne'er before discerned; And love and new-born joy broke in like day Upon his heaven-illumined soul. He turned To gaze upon the beauteous one, when lo! As from the clouds strange music 'gan to flow. Music it was, if thus is named in heaven Those mingled gushes of Seraphic bliss Which flowed like sunlight of the Spring-tide given In beamy gold to wake the wilderness; Or like the hymning of some circling band Of joyous stars just sped from their Creator's hand. Gently swelling, gently falling Softer, sweeter yet it grows; As when Summer's breeze is calling Fragrance from the dewy rose. Yes far sweeter and more thrilling Were the soulèd sounds that fell, All the airy concave filling And the heart's most secret cell. Tuneful breathings—voicèd hymning Joined with harps of golden sound Fill the spherèd concave brimming— Shed rich harmony around. Now the Trumpet's crystal voice Lifteth up its notes of joy Calling to the saved “Rejoice! Enter through Heaven's portal high.” Back the murky clouds are driven As the blackness of the sky By the morning sun is riven Angels! Angels! Blessed creatures! Toward the Voyager descend; Turn on him their holy features Lit by joy that ne'er can end; Down the streamy light they sweep Round him wave their dazzling wings; Lift him gently from the deep Whisper to him wondrous things. Swift he rises—Earth has left him With its painful load of clay;— Death or grief and sin hath reft him And he soars—away!—away! I turned mine eyes; I could no longer gaze Upon the Splendour, which intenser grew And live; To my relief a dimming haze Dropt like a curtain dark and shut the view; But 'neath the weight of Glory which had shone Upon the Earth's low bosom prostrate I was thrown. There long I lay mingling my sighs and tears Recalling all the Vision to my mind, Its varied scenes, its many hopes and fears Its seasons four mysteriously combined, How through bright Childhood's vale the river flowed Youth, Manhood, Age, to reach the mighty flood. But my soul spoke and roused me—“Rise Dwell not inactive on the Vision true Remember that Life's River swiftly hies Toward the great Deep and thou hast much to do: The Vision teaches when divined aright That he must trust in God and strike, who conquers in the fight.” Catskill June 14, 1844 [72. These shady groves, these bright blue hills] These shady groves, these bright blue hills From memory ne'er can pass away Though borne afar by winds and waves I visit realms of earlier day Within my heart I e'er shall feel The breezes of these vallies blow Each rippling lake, each glancing rill Will murmur wheresoe'er I go. No! These wild mountain streams and woods Have grown so beauteous to my soul That life's swift stream reflects them clear Where'er its wandering waters roll. Catskill Mountains 1845 73. The March of Time Hark! I heard the tread of Time O'er heaven's ether fields sublime; Through the portals of the Past; Where the stars by God were cast O'er the illimitable vast! Onward! Onward! Yet he strides; Nations clinging to his sides Kingdoms crushed, he tramples o'er: Fame's shrill trumpet—War's deep roar Blast-like rise—then speak no more. Lo he nears us! Like a cloud, Which the trembling sea doth shroud, Darkly folding every flower Of our life; Hope, Love and Power Ah! he grasps the present hour! Grasps it—it is withering Hangs a misty faded thing In his girdle seen no more But by deeds that stud it o'er These shall mark it evermore. On he passes swift as fear Hiding each faint struggling year Neath his pinion's shadowy fold All that sky and earth do hold. Much which man may not behold. Lo! beneath his mantle dark Grim, a spectre pallid, stark Clingeth round him like a sheath Powerful; yet devoid of breath— Throwing darts! 'Tis death! 'Tis death. Stop the ruffian Time! Lay hold! Hath Heaven nor Earth power so bold! As to meet his strength midway, Wrest from him the precious prey And the Tyrant-Robber slay. Struggle not my foolish soul Let Time's garments round thee roll. Time God's servant think no scorn, Gathers up the sheaths of corn Which the spectre Death hath shorn. And anon shall One appear Brighter than the Morning Star Who shall smite that Spectre frore. Time shall, clasped by death no more, Take a new name—Evermore. 1843 74. The March of Time Hark! I heard the tread of Time Marching o'er the fields sublime; Through the portals of the past When the stars by God were cast O'er the illimitable vast. Onward! Onward yet he strides Nations clinging to his sides. Kingdoms crushed he tramples o'er Fame's shrill Trumpet—War's deep Roar Blast-like rise—sound no more. Lo! he nears as like a cloud; That the trembling sea doth shroud, Darkly folding every flower Of our Life;—Love—Hope and Power: See! He grasps the Present Hour! Grasps it—it is withering And it hangs a faded thing In his girdle; seen no more But by deeds that stud it o'er— These shall mark it evermore. On he passes, swift as fear; Hides each faint and fleeting year In his pinion's shadowy fold;— All that sky and earth do hold:— Things which man may not behold. Lo! beneath his mantle dark Grim, a spectre pallid stark Clings around him like a sheath Mighty! though devoid of breath Throwing darts:—'Tis Death! 'Tis Death. Stop the Ruffian Time! Lay hold! Is there then no power so bold! None to meet his strength midway— Wrest from him his precious prey, And the Tyrant-Robber slay. Struggle not my foolish soul! Let Time's garments round thee roll: Time, God's servant, think no scorn, Gathers up the sheaves of corn Which the spectre Death hath shorn. And anon shall one appear Brighter than the Morning Star: He shall smite that Spectre frore Time shall, clasped by Death no more, Take a new name—Evermore. Catskill February 3, 1846 75. Just before Sunrise Rise from thy slumbers thou of counted years; Nor let the precious light fall on thy couch Like dews of heaven on a withered tree With profitless and unrefreshful waste. Rise! For the sun hath breathed upon the sky And the cold ether through its orient depths Melts like dusk metal in the forge's flame Rise! For the sun has full nigh climbed the wall Of horizontal amethyst and swift Unbars the gates of day. Rise ere he rises! 'Tis the choice moment of unnumbered hours. Cloudless the ether—deeper and more deep It grows—The piercing eye amazed is lost And life itself will not suffice to sound Depths that are infinite. See the wan moon Above the western steeps like a faint maiden Sinks 'mid her purple curtains to repose. And yonder mountains speechless as with awe Upturn their holy faces to the sky. Be still! For in this sacred solemn deep Of silence all things mute do pray. Amen!! October 27, 1847 76. The Cross O Sacred symbol of our Faith! Despised in this dark day By those who leave the narrow path To seek an easier way. To there raise my streaming eyes From Life's Tempestuous vale Where Sin's deep midnight-shadow lies And driving griefs assail. Thou art the dawn to my blessed sight That o'er the mountains breaks Already by thy holy light My soul triumphant wakes. We know thy growing light a sign The sun himself is nigh; The sun of Righteousness divine Ascends the glorious sky. At Eve he sank beneath the shade; But on dark Calvary's height Thy form a moon refulgent made By his transforming light— Brighter and brighter grows the cross The mountain-tops are gold And o'er death's vally far across The gorgeous light is rolled. 1848 77. Alone Yet Not Alone The desert flower afar may bloom Where foot of man ne'er trod Yet gracefully its soft perfume Ascendeth up to God And He will own the offering too, And fills its cup with living dew. Alone may sing the forest bird Afar from human ear, Yet there he singeth not unheard, For God is listening near; And He will cheer the warbler's breast, With pleasant food and quiet rest. Thus when before His gracious throne, With grateful praise I bend; I feel I am not all alone, For God is still my friend; And humble though my love may be, He answereth it with love to me. Each morn will bring a promise pure, As dew to desert flower; Each eve a rest as calm and pure, As birds in forest bower; Till death shall free my earth-bound wing, And bear me heavenward as I sing. 78. A Painter I know 'tis vain ye mountains, and ye woods To strive to match your wild, and wonderous hues, Ye rocks and lakes, and ever rolling floods, The gold-cinctur'd eve, or morn begemm'd with dews— Yes, day by day and year by year I've toil'd In the lone chamber, and the sunny field To grasp your beauty; but I have been foil'd— I cannot conquer; but I will not yield— How oft have I, where spread the pictur'd scene Wrought on the canvas with fond, anxious care, Deemed I had equalled nature's forests green, Her lakes, her rocks, and e'en the ambient air. Vain unpious thought! such feverish fancies sweep Swift from the brain—when nature's landscapes break Upon the thrilling sense—O I could weep Not that she is so beautiful; but I so weak— O! for a power to snatch the living light From heaven, and darkness from some deep abyss, Made palpable: with skill to mingle right Their mystery of beauty! then mine would be bliss! 79. Evening See the sun all gold and red Leaves the blue and open sky Sinking to his glorious bed Far beyond the mountains high. He has travelled all the day Over land and over sea Cheering with his pleasant ray All the living things that be. He the paths of men has lighted And the forests and the flowers Which without his beams were blighted By the long long darksome hours. Now the lofty mountain hides Half the bright face of the sun Downward and downward yet he glides— Now his daily journey's done. But to-morrow in the sky When the dewy morn shall come We shall see his shining eye Light again our pleasant home. Little children should take warning By the ever faithful sun Praise God who made the Sun, Night and Morning As their daily course is run. 80. Life Life is the keeper of the gate called Death, Leadeth us there and ope's the gloomy door Taketh thereat the toll, our mortal breath; Then journeys on with us forever more. Life is the mortal house where dwells the soul Upon the margin of eternal time One side is bared when waves of trouble roll; The other stands 'mid silent deeps sublime. Life is the air we breathe, the things around We see and feel—these are its mortal load Death touches us, they pass and with a bound We spring aloft to seek a new abode. Life is our all—this little vale of tears Is but the vestibule where we unrobe, Death lifts the curtain and beyond appears The Life of Life that is not of our globe. Life! Life! Which way we look is Life. Death Is but the shadow of our sin on Life; That dims the glass of being like a breath; But Heaven shall shine upon the shade and Life Be free from strain, and brighter be through Death. 81. Lines occasioned by the death of Miss M. A. W. The greedy tomb hath op'ned once again To snatch away that which we dearly prize Our loves our friendships, all, alas! seem vain For all we love, and cherish, quickly dies— Death the unsparing hath again stretch'd forth His icy hand—blighted a budding flower. So young, so beautiful, of so much worth We almost deem'd her rais'd beyond his power. The undrain'd cup of life from which she drank Was at its sweetest when 'twas dash'd away The flower was just at opening as it sank Beneath the chilling blight's untimely sway. “Mourn not the virtuous dead”: it hath been spoken; But what shall stop the sluices of our grief; Or heal affection's wounds so newly broken; Or offer to our hearts a quick relief— Not for her sake break forth our sighs of wo (She dwells in bliss supreme) but for our own, Still bound by earthly chains, to pains below, Wilst she exalted sits beside th' Almighty's throne. T. Cole 82. Lines suggested by a picture painted by Weir, in which a lady is seen sitting at a window gazing on the sea, whilst a youth at her side is playing the guitar— A lady sat by a window high And gaz'd upon the sea The tear drops came in her beauteous eye And hung there tremblingly. And a gallant youth was at her side: He looked not on the sea But touching the sweet guitar he cried “Oh lady! list to me.” “For thy beauty is to me the world My love a drainless sea, Pure as the sky that is now unfurl'd A stainless canopy. “Oh turn those eyes, which are my heav'n From off the vacant sea Let not thy tears to the waves be given On my bosom let them be.” She heard not though truth with music fell But still gaz'd on the sea For where the mind delights to dwell The eyes would gladly be. Her heart is with yon lessening sail As it fades o'er the sea, And if a loving maiden's tears avail 'Twill glide on pleasantly? And swift for the sake of one it hears Return o'er the quiet sea, And grief the source of those flowing tears Be chang'd to extacy. 83. Lines Suggested by a Voyage up the Hudson on a Moonlight Night Midnight the hour when silence sleeps When o'er dim vales and craggy steeps The viewless spirits of the sky Pour from their starry urns on high The pearly dew; each bud and flower Moistens its bosom in the shower And every fay his goblet fills With nectar which the heaven distils— Hudson! The breeze has ceased to press Thy wave! And on its placidness The moonbeams are caress'd, and lie Bright sleeping undisturbedly Ever should loveliness recline On couch as beautiful as thine— From out thy depths the mountains rise And lift their shadows to the skies— In silent awfulness they tower Like spectres that by magic power Are call'd from some vast black abyss Cav'd in earth's bosom bottomless, Whilst round each huge brow rough and sear The moonlight trembles as in fear. Yon moonlit bark beneath the hill Hath not a breeze its sail to fill But gently on the ebbing flood It glides past mountain rock and wood 'Tis like yon cloud that moves on high Alone—no other cloud is nigh. The winds are still but on it springs Borne by its own aerial wings— I love this stilly hour of night For fancy's visions are more bright Than in the troubled glare of day With all its pomp and proud display— Midnight hath loosed the chain that bound The spirit to its earthly round— TC 84. Lines suggested by hearing Music on the Boston Common at night Music it was I heard, and music too Of mortal utterance; but it did sound Unto my Fancy's ear like that of spirits; Spirits that dwell within the vasty caves Near the earth's center— Silence dwelt around. Then came soft sounds slowly, with pauses 'twixt Like sighs of sleepers in deep distant caves They sank and list'ning silence reign'd again. Then rose a voice, a single voice but shrill It rent the sable curtains of the gloom And pierc'd the confines of each echoing cave, And ev'ry spirit rais'd his sleepy head From the cold pillow of the dripping rock— Again the single voice, rang with a shriller tone, Each spirit answer'd from his hidden nook— Some voices came from distant winding cliffs And sought the ear like angel whisperings. From the deep arches of the rocky roof Tones rich as those of heav'n's own trumpets burst. From out the dark profound abyss arose Sounds as of earthquake, thunder, or the roar Of booming cataracts—silence again— Hark! They have met within the giant hall: Whose roof is pillar'd by huge mountain tops, And voices shrill, and deep in concord loudly join. The heaving harmony sweeps to and fro Surge over surge and fills the ample place. Ocean of sound sublime!! The tides contend, Augment, higher, yet higher; Earth cannot Contain; it yields—'tis riven—and falling rocks And tottering pinnacles join their dread voices In the tumultuous and astounding roar— 'Tis past. And nought now strikes the waiting ear Save the soft echoes ling'ring on their way. Soft! They have ceas'd to whisper, having found The cave of silence their eternal tomb. T. C. 85. Morning See how shines the morning light Gently on each tree and flower! God hath kept them safe all night By his goodness and his power. Through the long, dark hours gone by While we all were fast asleep God with his all-seeing eye From all danger did us keep. On the trees that stand close by Birds their little voices raise Singing to the Lord on high In sweet strains of thankful praise. Like the birds with cheerful voice, When the morning lights the sky, Our own simple songs should rise Unto God who dwells on high. 86. The Burial Ground at Catskill The hill is climb'd and this the place of rest— Here, among tombs beneath whose simple shade Sleep those who wake not, when the eastern light Streams o'er the hills, and gilds the silky grass That waves, and whispers o'er their lowly bed. Close are the earthy curtains that surround Them drawn and not a single ray can pierce The silent valley of their deep repose— They need it not,—their tasks of toil are o'er— No more the voice of friendship or of love Calls them to gaze upon the glorious morn— But oft a mourner o'er the simple tomb Woos from his memory lov'd and cherish'd things And as each image rises from the deep The fount of sorrow gushes forth afresh— This is indeed a place of rest and such Would be my choice if heav'n would grant my boon, To be sepulchred here—to rest upon The spot of earth that living I have lov'd. No marble pile, no vaunting verse I wish To mark my resting place to tell the world Of virtues that I ne'er possess'd—for pomp An icier chill gives to the cold clay— But here! beneath the solemn dome of heaven, Where the free winds forever warble wild Where yon far mountains steep; would constant look Upon the grave of one who lov'd to gaze on them— O! I have stood here when the westering sun Had placed a glory on the scene and gaz'd Upon the mountains woods, and sky, until My spirit disenthralled, forgot its clay— It moved among the mountains and amid The clouds rejoicing held its way. 87. The Lute One day I fled the tainted crowd And wandered far away To where the wild woods' sombre shroud Shut out the light of day. And when the solitude was mine On gray, fantastic root I sat; of old and hoary pine And struck my mournful lute. An antique Lute it was I brought From a far, tuneful land With a wild melody 'twas fraught When struck with skilful hand. For it had Music's spirit bound Within its stringèd zone Which seemed when sank its native ground To take a sorrowing tone. How much of Heaven there can be Wrapped in the fashioned wood! The wind-songs of the parent tree Thrilled yet in mournful mood. The weary world was far away The world of care and pain And pride was far and pomp's display, That vex the tortured brain. My swelling voice with power did rise And stirred the sleepy air; The timorous deer with star-like eyes Stood still and listened there. I sang my heart; for it was full The world had wronged it so And sad and unrequited love Had wrought it much of woe. I called the rocks and streamlets near To listen to my strain And bade the woodland spirits hear! I did not sing in vain. I sang “I cast the world behind To worship in your Fane Ambition ne'er shall rule my mind Nor Love imperious reign. “The face of man no more I'll see; But live and die in peace And learn to love the flower and tree And tend their lovliness. “The deer shall my companion be Attendant at my side The squirrel leave the lofty tree And in my cot abide. “That cot of branches shall be made With roof of matted pine And on its floor soft masses laid Inviting to recline. “The streamlet gurgling by my door Sweet beverage shall be And I will have a plenteous store Of Honey from the tree. “A little spot for herbs and roots Will be my greatest care And gathering these with fallen nuts 'Gainst winter's dearth prepare. “Let winter come my Lute and I When raves the snowy blast Will weave a gentle lulaby Until the storm is past. “While on the hearth the branches blaze And light my leaf-lined bower I'll ne'er regret my world-past days Nor envy wealth and power. “I have a kingdom in my mind My Fancy's wide domain And gentle thoughts and visions kind Shall be my serving train. “There renounce all mortal love Spirits O hear my vow! No more shall tender passion move; To be propitious now. “And if this prayerful vow arise All pleasing to your ears And you accept my sacrifice; Let some sure sign appear.” I scarce had ceased when rushed a blast Through the black wood with rain; My Lute afar from me was cast— Its strings were snapt in twain. I snatched it in my trembling fear And fled the darksome dell. No more I sought the forest drear: Constrained 'mid men to dwell. My gentle Lute I strung again: It still had power to move.— Again I struck the thrilling strain Of tendernous and Love. The maid I once believed so cold, Listened and softly sighed, And when I told her scorn of old Two melting lips replied. 88. The Man of Pride He sat upon a rock that proudly rear'd Upon the mountain's top; higher than aught around. His brow bore lines, which were not those that years Are wont to grave—but stronger deeper marks Of thought, of suffering, and of passion's power— His face was nobly formed; but pride sat stern Upon its beauty, darkening it as though A fiend there cast the shadow of his wing— There he had come to die: scorning the world, In which he long had toiled for preeminence By trampling too, upon his fellow man Whom he considered slave—and he had risen— High, and had been cast down—but yet that spirit pride, Could never be cut down—He left the world He could not dominate—and fled to wilds To be a monarch there; but pride is torture— For in the wild the beasts would not obey, The winds blew where they listed, and the storm Beat fiercely e'en on him—He climbed the hill It was a foolish thought—that he might stand And look from high upon the world he hated, He gazed upon it and he wished for power To scatter lightenings into distant lands— And in the fury of excited pride Towards the clouds he raised an impious hand To reach the thunderbolt and fell and died By his own passion's lightening struck down. 89. The Mountain Bird Roused by the carol of the mountain bird From dreams of earth and sorrow I awoke. Uplifted by the blissful strains I heard Bright Hope again upon my spirit broke: “O bird!” I said “That warblest to the soul And with wild musick through the summer long Dost charm the orbèd days as on they roll And makest the mountains listeners to thy song; “Whence is the magic of thine artless strain? Is it the effluence of a sinless breast:— The gush of innocent joy untouched by pain,— The beauteous language of a Spirit blessed? “Sing on thou Heaven-taught Minstrel so thy song May find the inmost chamber of my soul— And echoing there its melody prolong 'Till death's dark billows o'er my bosom roll. “If unto thee such melody is given, Subject to Death and earth-born like to me, The burthen of my song so full of Heaven, What must the choral songs of Seraphs be—?” Catskill Mountain House 90.

To ? When leaves seem trembling with delight Upon the twilight sky And eve-clouds in the purple light Are wasting silently,— When from the depth of some brown wood The cataract's spray ascends, Or in the clear and trembling flood The moon its radiance blends, That is the hour I think of thee— For thou more beautiful than they Canst gaze and feel like me, But leaves, and clouds, and cataract's spray, And water moon-lit tremblingly, Feel not—nor lovible thoughts have they To turn to one who wanders far away. 92. To a Lock of Hair— Best relic of the distant or the dead Unchanged art thou by season, space or years; O'er present thoughts thou hast the power to shed The hues of by-gone days, and call our tears From out their founts, in soft and soothing sorrow; Revealing to our souls, those whom we love, In a full keen remembrance—And we borrow Through thee a light into the past, and move Among friends dear to us, and learn to know Our bosoms are not chilled by care and wrong And love as they have loved—except the flow Of their affection is more deep and strong— Like to a lake whose icy bands are riven By the soft breath of spring—it breaks away And to the current power and strength are given By that which bound it on the winter's day. T. C. 93. To CBT Hast thou forgotten me my friend Me and the hours in social converse pass'd When our glad spirits each supporting each On the strong wings of sympathy upborne Into the realms of extacy have soar'd— Far, far, above the dense foul atmosphere Of Worldly things—Hast thou forgotten me. Me and our wanderings in the mountain's wilds By those lone lakes that sleep so calm Beneath the shadows of the piny hills— Or that bleak cliff on which we stood amaz'd And look'd upon the world beneath our feet, And on the clouds huge rolling o'er our heads And felt like spirits of the air sublime Free and unfettered by our mortal bonds. Hast thou forgotten too our deep commune When night had hung o'er mountain top and vale Her gloomy veil impervious, and had pour'd, On every eye but ours, the balm of sleep. Though darkness was around, our souls were light Kindled by inspiration—and we had Such views sublime of the great universe And of its God as mortals seldom gain— Hast thou forgotten me my friend O no! it cannot cannot be; our souls So many times have drunk from the same cup Which nature held—that they are link'd In hands which nought but death hath pow'r to break. 94. To Spring Not on dove-like pinions To thy wide dominions Spring thou doest come But on the tempest's wing Driving the Hoary Ring An exile in Antartic wastes to roam. Like Freedom when she shouteth “Tyrants shall fall” And her banner flouteth O'er the crushed dungeon-wall, And her foot trampleth on the Crowned wrong Fierce art thou Spring and wonderfully strong. But the dreadful battle o'er And winter struggleth no more, And the Captive Lakes are free And the flowerets on the lea; And the birds are praising thee Gentle as Freedom when Peace is restored to men, And Love with wide extended hands Does sit the ruler of the lands. [95. A reminiscence of my perish'd love] A reminiscence of my perish'd love Shone softly o'er my mind It came as moonlight on the grove Or music on the wind— It had a sweet regretful power Like fragrance from a withered flower— Ye visitations from the fading past, Spirits of departed joys, When gloom and sadness overcast, Then to my soul arise And be like sunshine on the grave Of hopes I loved but could not save— Come as the twilight of the day Whose summer now is past away— [96. A reminiscence of departed love] A reminiscence of departed love Shone softly o'er my mind It came like moonlight on the grove; Or music on the wind: It had a sweet regretful power Like fragrance from a withered flower. Ye visitations from the fading past— Spirits of departed joys! When gloom and sadness overcast Then to my soul arise, And be like sunshine on the grave Of hopes I reared but could not save— Come as the twilight of the day Whose splendor now is past away. [97. A spell comes o'er th' excited soul whene'er] A spell comes o'er th' excited soul whene'er Soft music floats upon the breeze; all things Do then inanimate or quick appear; to feel. The insect on the winged sound seems borne The bird is urged on its airy course; the bark Is wafted on—mysteriously— [98. How awful was the voice that came to Job] How awful was the voice that came to Job In the still night—that said “shall mortal man Be more just than his God”—In robe mysterious The spirit form was wrapp'd—Solemn, and slow The words broke forth—and deep as is the roar Of some vast, distant cataract, whose sound Shakes the dark woods, the rocks, the hills around And rises, sinks and thunders on the shore— [99. How changeful is the cloud that flits along] How changeful is the cloud that flits along From darkling crag to crag, to it belong Nor fixedness nor rest, ever it moves As vainly seeking some bright thing which loves— Thus 'tis with one whose longing bosom beats Lured on by beauty, but who never meets The love-glance answering from a modest eye— No murmuring assent and no responding sigh; And finds with anguish none can love him well Though in his bosom love would fainly dwell— [100. O Nature my sole mistress unto thee] O Nature my sole mistress unto thee I turn again and wonder why my soul Should ever seek for Beauty's smiles; to be Deceived as they have aye deceived—The bowl Of love to me much bitterness doth hold— Sweet smiles are oft but flowers gay Hiding the rock forever hard and cold,— But thy sweet smiles Nature ne'er betray. [101. Take me Zephyr on thy wings] Take me Zephyr on thy wings From the din of worldly things Waft me to the mountains high Take me Zephyr or I die— Take me Zephyr to the roar Of ocean dashing on its shore Where no one hears its voice but I Take me Zephyr or I die— Take me Zephyr to some vale Where solitude and peace prevail Where mortal step is never nigh Take me Zephyr or I die— Take me Zephyr on thy wings Where to th' Recluse nothing brings A thought of man: there could I Live in peace and peaceful die. [102. Thy gloom O twilight suits my soul] Thy gloom O twilight suits my soul For pensive sadness dwells with thee; And deep thoughts rise by thy controul Like swells upon a tranquil sea— Yes! on the ocean of my mind Which has been lash'd by the tempests rude That are gone by; but leave behind The silent heaving of the flood— I wander slowly there to mark The sunlit heavens fading fast Like youth's own visions growing dark Too lov'd, too beautiful to last— There is a cloud upon the sky And it hath ta'en the saddest hue No kindred clouds are floating by Sojourning in the trackless blue. An emblem of my destiny, In that low cloud perhaps I find Companionless like it to be When fortune's sun hath sad declin'd. [103. 'Tis all a dream: our joys, our fears] 'Tis all a dream: our joys, our fears Our hopes a dream—The spirit hath existence But now it sleeps, of its earthly sleep These are the feverish visions—The waking time Draws near, when all such ill-form'd phantasies Shall flee away like night-clouds from the sun— A morn shall dawn: a bright mid-day arrive Then the reality of being shall be known In the full glory of eternal life— [104. Who breaks the silence of the night] Who breaks the silence of the night With deep and desperate cry? Who curses while the golden light Is on the mountains high?— In a stone dungeon deep and dark A miserable wretch doth lie Who calls for vengeance, raves for love But praying cannot die— Three days within that rock bound cell Three summer days they short may seem To those who on the mountains dwell And watch the cloud's sunny beam— But unto him whose fetters gall Bound to the cold unpitying stone Where light nor dew drop ever fall Where earth's dank sweat at each loud groan Is shaken from the shiney wall Three days are centuries— [105. Who that hath breathed on mountain top, where winds] Who that hath breathed on mountain top, where winds Gush fresh from heaven—who that had proudly stood O'er the embattled cliff and watched the clouds; Heave in extended tumult far below; Or felt the torrent's spray dash on his cheek: Can unregretful let his days consume In tainted cities where the air is thick And stagnant with impurity and hath Been breathed and breathed again—amid the din The daily darkness and the lasting strife—</field>
