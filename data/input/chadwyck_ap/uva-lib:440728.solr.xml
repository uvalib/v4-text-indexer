      <field name="fulltext">Part I. THE NEW-YORK BOY'S SONG TO CROTON WATER. Oh, blessed be the Croton! It floweth everywhere— It sprinkles o'er the dusty ground, It cooleth all the air. It poureth by the wayside, A constant stream of joy, To every little radish girl, And chimney-sweeping boy. Poor little ragged children, Who sleep in wretched places, Come out for Croton water, To wash their dirty faces. And if they find a big tub full, They shout aloud with glee, And all unite to freight a chip, And send it out to sea. To the ever-running hydrant The dogs delight to go, To bathe themselves, and wet their tongues, In the silver water-flow. The thirsty horse, he knoweth well Where the Croton poureth down, And thinks his fare is much improved In the hot and dusty town. And many a drunkard has forgot To seek the fiery cup; For everywhere, before his face, Sweet water leapeth up. Then blessings on the Croton! It flows for man and beast, And gives its wealth out freely, To the greatest and the least. We city boys take great delight To watch its bubbling play, To make it rush up in the air, Or whirl around in spray. It is good sport to guide a hose Against the window-pane, Or dash it through the dusty trees, Like driving summer rain. Oh, blessed be the Croton! It gives us endless fun, To make it jump and splash about, And sparkle in the sun. And the Fountains in their beauty, It glads our hearts to see— Ever springing up to heaven, So gracefully and free. Fast fall their sparkling diamonds, Beneath the sun's bright glance, And like attendant fairies, The shim'ring rainbows dance. White and pure their feathery foam, Under the moon's mild ray, While twinkling stars look brightly down Upon their ceaseless play. And all about the crowded town, In garden, shop, or bower, Neat little fountains scatter round A small refreshing shower. Perhaps some dolphin spouts it forth To sprinkle flower or grass, Or marble boy, with dripping urn, Salutes you as you pass. Then blessings on the Croton! May it diminish never— For its glorious beauty Is a joy forever. Note.—In former years, water was very scarce and very bad, in some parts of the city of New-York. But now an abundance of delicious water is brought from the river Croton, forty miles off. It runs under-ground, in big iron pipes. In every street, are conductors, called hydrants, from which small streams slow continually. GEORGE AND HIS DOG George had a large and noble dog With hair as soft as silk; A few black spots upon his back, The rest as white as milk. And many a happy hour they had, In dull or shining weather; For, in the house, or in the fields, They always were together. It was rare fun to see them race, Through fields of bright red clover, And jump across the running brooks, George and his good dog Rover. The faithful creature knew full well When master wished to ride; And he would kneel down on the grass, While Georgy climbed his side. They both were playing in the field, When all at once they saw A little squirrel on a stump, With an acorn in his paw. Rover sent forth a loud bow-wow, And tried to start away; He thought to scare the little beast Would be a noble play. But George cried out, “For shame! for shame! You are so big and strong, To worry that poor little thing Would be both mean and wrong.” The dog still looked with eager eye, And George could plainly see, It was as much as he could do, To let the squirrel be. The timid creature would have feared The dog so bold and strong, But he seemed to know the little boy Would let him do no wrong. He peeped in George's smiling face, And trusting to his care, He kept his seat upon the stump, And ate his acorn there. He felt a spirit of pure love Around the gentle boy, As if good angels, hovering there, Watched over him in joy. And true it is, the angels oft Good little George have led; They're with him in his happy play, They guard his little bed. They keep his heart so kind and true, They make his eye so mild; For dearly do the angels love A gentle little child. LITTLE BIRD! LITTLE BIRD! Little bird! little bird! come to me! Here is a green cage hung on the tree. Beauty-bright flowers I'll bring to you, And fresh ripe cherries, all wet with dew. Thanks, little maiden, for all thy care; But I dearly love the free broad air; And my snug little nest in the old oak tree Is better than golden cage for me. Little bird! little bird! where wilt thou go, When the fields are all buried in snow? The ice will cover your old oak tree; You had better come and stay with me. Nay, little maiden, away I'll fly To greener fields and a warmer sky. When Spring returns with pattering rain, You will hear my merry song again. Little bird! little bird! who'll guide thee Over the hills and over the sea? Foolish one, come in the house to stay, For I'm very sure you'll lose your way Ah no, little maiden! God guides me Over the hills and over the sea. I will be free as the rushing air, Chasing the sunlight everywhere. THE SISTER'S HYMN. ABOUT A VERY LITTLE BROTHER, WHO WENT AWAY FROM THIS WORLD TO LIVE WITH THE ANGELS. “They laid him in a chamber, whose windows opened toward the sun-rising; the name of the chamber was Peace; where he slept till break of day, and then he awoke and sang.” Pilgrim's Progress. Brother James was a charming boy, Loving and full of glee— It always filled our hearts with joy His happy face to see. He was so funny, yet so mild, In all his infant plays— I never saw a little child That had such winning ways. I used to say, “The little birds Do in their nests agree;” And that he understood the words Was plain as it could be. For sometimes, if he chanced to fret, He 'd nestle close to me, And sorry for his little pet, Would kiss, and lisp “gee, gee.” Oh, how he loved to run about, And gather the spring posies! He would have raised a merry shout, To see the great red roses! But his dear little soul was gone, Ere the buds began to blow: I wish he could have seen just one— It would have pleased him so. But father says he's gone away To a world of brighter flowers, Where little angels with him play Through all the pleasant hours. Sweetly his little laughing voice Floats on the balmy air, And many heavenly babes rejoice To see my brother there. They bring him little lambs and doves, And joy shines in his face; For all the things our darling loves Are in that blessed place. And when he falls asleep at even, His dreams are bright and fair; His spirit feels at home in Heaven, And thinks we're with him there.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Part II. THE NEW-ENGLAND BOY'S SONG ABOUT THANKSGIVING DAY. Over the river, and through the wood, To grandfather's house we go; The horse knows the way, To carry the sleigh, Through the white and drifted snow. Over the river, and through the wood, To grandfather's house away! We would not stop For doll or top, For 't is Thanksgiving day. Over the river, and through the wood, Oh, how the wind does blow! It stings the toes, And bites the nose, As over the ground we go. Over the river, and through the wood, With a clear blue winter sky, The dogs do bark, And children hark, As we go jingling by. Over the river, and through the wood, To have a first-rate play— Hear the bells ring Ting a ling ding, Hurra for Thanksgiving day! Over the river, and through the wood— No matter for wind that blow; Or if we get The sleigh upset, Into a bank of snow. THE SPRING BIRDS. Now we know that winter's done, For a troop of swallows come, Twitter, twitter, in the air, Twitter, twitter, everywhere. Oh, they are sweet pretty things! Flying round with rapid wings, Twitter, twitter, in the air, Twitter, twitter, everywhere. The swallow knows no other tune, But always sings to May and June, Twitter, twitter, in the air, Twitter, twitter, everywhere. THE AUTUMN BIRD. When the summer is getting old, And nights and mornings growing cold, Then comes and sits upon the spray The friendly little chick-a-day. She is a chubby little bird, And all day long her song is heard, Her friendly chick-a-day, Chick-a-day, day, day. She never minds a cloudy sky, But ever singeth cheerily, Her friendly chick-a-day, Chick-a-day, day, day. When cold winter draweth near, Dearly do I love to hear Her friendly chick-a-day, Chick-a-day, day, day. Blessings on the happy bird, With her pleasant little word, Her friendly chick-a-day, Chick-a-day, day, day. FATHER IS COMING! Hark, hark!” say the children, “hark, hark!” And out of doors they go; For they hear the dog begin to bark, And father comes, they know. Jane, and Lucy, and Charley dear, All love the noisy Tray; And quick they spring his bark to hear, At close of summer's day. For when Tray jumps the orchard wall, Their hearts are full of bliss, And forth they scamper, one and all, To gain a father's kiss. And dearly father loves to take His babies on his knee, While one calls out for “patty cake,” Another cries, “Take me!” Jane runs to bring the milk and bread, And Lucy takes his hat, While Charley shakes his silky head, And brings his pussy cat. The happy boy, and Lucy too, Will father's supper share; Then Jane unties each little shoe, And mother combs their hair. And this is why, at set of sun, They every one will hark, To see who first will call, “Run, run! For Tray begins to bark!” THE HEN AND HER DUCKS. There was a little hen, Very small and thick, And this little hen Never had a chick. But in the straw, one day, She began to scratch, And four eggs she did lay, Some young ones to hatch. The farmer heard her cluck, And he thought it best, To put the eggs of a duck Into biddy's nest. And soon the hen marched out, With a pretty young brood, But what she led about, She never understood. Proud was the little biddy, When she called chuck, chuck; She did not know, the niddy, A chicken from a duck. The first pond they came nigh, The ducks waddled in, While poor biddy did cry, And make a loud din. But the ducks did not know What frightened their mother, Or what made her scream so, And make such a pother. For they liked it right well, To splash in the waters, While the hen could not tell What on earth ailed her daughters So she spread out her wings, And went screaming about, Till the fat little things Had all paddled out. The poor hen did not know, For nobody taught her, That young ducks always go Right into the water. And she never understood That farmers play tricks; So she thought her little brood Were all honest chicks. And hard she did strive To teach them aright, For to see them all dive, Gave her many a fright. But the ducklings grew strong, And she stopped her cries; For she thought she was wrong, And the little ones wise. They grew up and went away, And biddy lived alone, Till she laid some eggs one day, Under the barn-door stone. She kept her eggs full warm, And brooded them so well, That by and bye a swarm Of chickens broke the shell. Proud was the hen, and fond, But little she did know, For down unto the pond, She made the young ones go. When she saw they would not dive, She made a great ado, For she thought she ought to drive Her little chickens through. The poor little timid things, They were afraid to go, But she beat them with her wings; She thought she must do so. They knew not what she meant; She drove them round and round, Till into the pond they went, And there her chickens drowned. Poor little biddy couldn't think What made her first brood thrive, And all the others sink, Before they learned to dive. It was a pity she didn't know It could not bring good luck, To train a little chicken up As if it were a duck. WHO STOLE THE BIRD'S NEST? To whit! To whit! To whee! Will you listen to me? Who stole four eggs I laid, And the nice nest I made? Not I, said the cow, Moo oo! Such a thing I'd never do. I gave you a wisp of hay, But didn't take your nest away. Not I, said the cow, Moo oo! Such a thing I'd never do. To whit, To whit, To whee! Will you listen to me? Who stole four eggs I laid, And the nice nest I made? Bob-a-link! Bob-a-link! Now what do you think? Who stole a nest away From the plumb-tree to-day? Not I, said the dog, Bow wow, I wouldn't be so mean, I vow. I gave hairs the nest to make, But the nest I did not take. Not I, said the dog, Bow wow! I wouldn't be so mean, I vow. To whit! To whit! To whee! Will you listen to me? Who stole four eggs I laid, And the nice nest I made? Bob-a-link! Bob-a-link! Now what do you think? Who stole a nest away From the plumb-tree to-day? Coo coo! Coo coo! Coo coo! Let me speak a word, too. Who stole that pretty nest, From little yellow breast? Not I, said the sheep; oh no, I wouldn't treat a poor bird so. I gave wool the nest to line, But the nest was none of mine. Baa baa! said the sheep, oh no, I wouldn't treat a poor bird so. To whit! To whit! To whee! Will you listen to me? Who stole four eggs I laid, And the nice nest I made? Bob-a-link! Bob-a-link! Now what do you think? Who stole a nest away From the plumb-tree to-day? Coo coo! Coo coo! Coo coo! Let me speak a word, too. Who stole that pretty nest From little yellow breast? Caw! Caw! cried the crow, I should like to know, What thief took away A bird's nest to-day? Cluck, cluck, said the hen, Don't ask me again. Why I haven't a chick Would do such a trick. We all gave her a feather, And she wove them together. I'd scorn to intrude On her and her brood. Cluck, cluck, said the hen, Don't ask me again. Chirr-a-whirr! Chirr-a-whirr! We will make a great stir! Let us find out his name, And all cry for shame! I would not rob a bird, Said little Mary Green; I think I never heard Of any thing so mean. 'Tis very cruel, too, Said little Alice Neal; I wonder if he knew How sad the bird would feel A little boy hung down his head, And went and hid behind the bed; For he stole that pretty nest, From poor little yellow breast; And he felt so full of shame, He didn't like to tell his name. MY SISTER MARY. A Talk between an Uncle and his Niece. UNCLE. Louise, Mary must live with me, And I'll give you, for company, A pretty bird with glossy wings, That hops about and sweetly sings. Her garden filled with lovely flowers, Shall have two honey-suckle bowers, And golden fish, in sparkling water, If she will come and be my daughter. LOUISA. But she's my sister, uncle Carey; My own sweet loving sister Mary. I cannot spare her for a day; She helps me at my work and play. How I should cry if she were gone! I could not dress my doll alone. Therefore, dear uncle, I do pray You will not make her go away. Good cousin Jane may live with you; She has no little sister Loo. You may give her the bright Canary, And let me keep dear sister Mary. I'm very sure she will not go From little Loo who loves her so UNCLE. Now blessings on your gentle heart! I should be loth to see ye part. You need not cling to her in fear; You shall not lose your playmate, dear. My words were merely meant to prove How dearly you your sister love. I will give her the bright Canary, And she shall be your sister Mary OUR PLAYTHINGS. Susan has a waxen doll, With little bright blue eyes, And Mary has a pretty Poll, That chatters, laughs, and cries. Dear James has made a handsome ship, With famous mast and sails, And father bought for little Phip A wooden cow and pails. Louisa has a milk-white dove, And little china boys; But I have something that I love Better than birds or toys. It never speaks a single word, Yet tells me many things, About some darling little bird, That makes its nest and sings; About good little children too, And little babies dear, It tells me many stories new, And some are very queer. Of all my things I like it best. Peep in and take a look! 'Tis prettier than all the rest, My little story book.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Part III. TO A LITTLE GIRL, WALKING IN THE WOOD. Whither art going, dear Annette? Your little feet you'll surely wet; For don't you see the streamlet flow Across the path where you must go? Your shawl is twisted out of place, Your bonnet's blowing off your face; You know not how the playful air Is tangling up your curly hair. Lady, my feet I often wet, But it has never harmed me yet. I love to have the fresh warm air Playing about my face and hair; It makes me lively, bright, and strong; And clears the voice for my morning song. But do you often go alone, So far away from your own dear home? Not even a dog to frisk and play, And guide you on your lonely way? My mother cannot spare the maid, And I am not at all afraid. The wind plays mischief with my curls, But does no harm to little girls. There cannot be a lonely way, When Spring makes every thing so gay. The birds are warbling forth a tune To welcome dear delightful June; In the running brook, the speckled trout, At sight of my shadow, glides about; The little miller in the grass Flies away for my feet to pass; And busy bees, through shining hours, Play hide-and-seek in opening flowers; The bright blue sky is clear and mild; How can there be a lonesome child? Sweet wanderer in the cool green wood, I know your little heart is good; And that is why the fair earth seems Just waking up from heavenly dreams. There's something in your gentle voice That makes my inmost heart rejoice. Pray, if it be not rudely said, What's in your basket, little maid? Lady, the nurse, who watched my slumber, And told me stories without number, Is now too ill to work for pay, And she grows poorer every day. Custards, and broth, and jellies good, My mother sends to her for food. I bring the water from her well, And all my pretty stories tell. Sometimes she loves to hear me read; Her little garden I can weed; And half the money in my purse I gladly save for dear old nurse. But if I stay to talk so free, She'll wonder where Annette can be. Farewell, sweet wanderer of the wood, I knew your little heart was good; And that is why the fair earth seems Just waking up from heavenly dreams. AUNT MARIA'S SWALLOWS. A TRUE STORY. “Petit a petit, L'oiseau fait son nid.” Twas in the spring-time of the year, The latter part of May, When two small birds, with merry cheer, Came to our house one day. I watched them with a loving smile, As they glanced in and out. And in their busy, chirping style, Went peering all about. I knew that they would build a nest; And joy it was to me, That the place they liked the best, Beneath our roof should be. In the crotch of a sheltering beam, They found a cozy spot; And never before or since, I ween, Chose birds a better lot. The green boughs of a tall old tree Gave them a pleasant shade, While, through an arch, they well could see Where sun and river played. And here they came in sunny hours, And here their nest they made, Safe, as if hid in greenwood bowers, For none their will gainsaid. I think they felt a friendly sphere, And knew we loved them dearly; For they seemed to have no thought of fear, And planned their household cheerly. They fanned me with their busy wings, And buzzed about my head; Never were such familiar things In field or forest bred. The father was a gentle bird, Right gracefully he wooed, And softer notes were never heard, Than to his mate he cooed. And, when their clay-built nest she lined, He'd go, in sunny weather, And search and search, till he could find Some little downy feather. Then high would swell his loving breast, He felt so very proud, And he would sidle to the nest, And call to her aloud. And she would raise her glossy head, And make a mighty stir, To see if it were hair or thread, That he had brought for her. And she would take it from his bill, With such an easy grace, As courtly beauties sometimes will Accept a veil of lace. They did not know, the pretty things! How beautiful they were! Whether they moved with rapid wings, Or balanced on the air. And yet they almost seemed to know They had a winsome grace; As if they meant to make a show, They'd choose their resting-place. On a suspended hoop they'd swing, Swayed by the buoyant air, Or, perched on upright hoe, would sing Songs of a loving pair. Swiftly as rays of golden light, They glanced forth to and fro, So rapid, that the keenest sight Could scarcely see them go. The lover proved a husband kind, Attentive to his mate; He helped her when the nest was lined, And never staid out late. And while she hatched, with patient care, He took his turn to brood, That she might skim along the air, To find her needful food. He did it with an awkward hop, And the eggs seemed like to break, Just as some clumsy man would mop, Or thread and needle take. But there with patient love he sat, And kept the eggs right warm, And sharply watched for dog or cat, Until his mate's return. And when the young birds broke the shell, He took a generous share In her hourly task to feed them well, With insects from the air. But, when they taught the brood to fly, 'Twas curious to see How hard the parent birds would try, And twitter coaxingly. From beam to beam, from floor to nest, With eager haste they flew; They could not take a moment's rest, They had so much to do. For a long while they vainly strived, Both male and female swallow; In vain they soared, in vain they dived, The young ones would not follow. The little helpless timid things Looked up, and looked below, And thought, before they tried their wings, They'd take more time to grow. The parents seemed, at last, to tire Of their incessant labors; And forth they went, to beg or hire Assistance from their neighbors. And soon they came, with rushing noise, Some eight or ten, or more, Much like a troop of merry boys, Before the school-house door. They flew about, and perched about, In every sort of style, And called aloud, with constant shout, And watched the nest the while. The little birds, they seemed half crazed, So well they liked the fun; Yet were the simple things amazed To see how it was done. They gazed upon the playful flock, With eager, beaming eyes, And tried their winged ways to mock, And mock their twittering cries. They stretched themselves, with many a shake And oft, before they flew, Did they their feathery toilet make, And with a great ado. Three times the neighbors came that day To teach their simple rules, According to the usual way, In all the Flying Schools. The perpendicular they taught, And the graceful parallel; And sure I am, the younglings ought To learn their lessons well. Down from the nest at last they dropped, As if half dead with fear; And round among the logs they hopped, Their parents hovering near. Then back again they feebly flew, To rest from their great labors, And twittered a polite adieu To all their friendly neighbors. Next day, they fluttered up and down: One perched upon my cap; Another on the old loose gown, In which I take my nap. Each day they practised many hours, Till they mounted up so high, I thought they would be caught in showers, And never get home dry. But when the sun sank in the west, My favorites would return, And sit around their little nest, Like figures on an urn. And there they dropped away to sleep, With heads beneath their wings. I would have given much to keep The precious little things. But soon the nest became too small, They grew so big and stout; And when it would not hold them all, They had some fallings out. Three of the five first went away, To roost on the tall old tree; But back and forth they came all day, Their sister-kins to see. My heart was sad to find, one night, That none came back to me; I saw them, by the dim twilight, Flock to the tall old tree. But still they often met together, Near that little clay-built nest; 'Twas in the rainiest weather They seemed to like it best. Yet often, when the sun was clear, They'd leave their winged troops, Again to visit scenes so dear, And swing upon the hoops. Just as when human beings roam, The busy absent brother Loves to re-visit his old home, Where lived his darling mother. Months passed away, and still they came, When stars began to rise, And flew around our window pane, To catch the sleepy flies. Into our supper-room they flew, And circled round my head; For well the pretty creatures knew They had no cause for dread. But winter comes, and they are gone After the Southern sun; And left their human friends alone, To wish that spring would come.</field>
