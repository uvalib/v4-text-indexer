      <field name="fulltext">Springfield Town is Butterfly Town Here butterflies have their pony Who can go beyond their range, Into regions they Consider strange. They mount his curly Pegasus mane And fly past the North Pole. Or he wings through Smoking craters, Emerging gay and whole. Only a few can cling unsinged All the way and back From the big sun, from the far stars On his accustomed track. If you hear a singing butterfly In our groves, he took the ride And came transformed, to talk to you And rouse your nerve and pride. And say: “Rebuild our Springfield town With halls all flowers and wings, A town as spacious as the stars, A harp with silver strings. “I come to show a butterfly Can sometimes be a bird, And teach to you a flash of light Can sometimes be a word, The hieroglyphs upon his wings The printed song he sings. “For butterflies have their Pegasus To ride beyond their range Into lands of learning That they consider strange. “You write your memos on your cuff And look at them in haste. This aviator does not let His wing-space go to waste.” In the Shade of the Old Apple Tree I watch three apple blossoms on the topmost bough Of my proud Johnny Appleseed gnarled apple tree, There with Robin Redbreast, singing love to me. It is the first hot day of spring And now The wild sun and the clouds, I know not how, With Robin and the three Sing American To me. The largest blossom sings My name is Elizabeth C. A littler blossom sings My name is Susan D. The little blossom sings My name is Nicky C. But Robin Redbreast sings All three Are Poetree And I am Poetree, Our names are all one name, Just Poetree. Then my three apple blossoms are so great They fill my whole wide sky with their estate. Perfume and Poetree, Prophecy and incense are set free And they redeem the gnarled old apple tree, Vindicate the worm-gnawed, blight spoiled long-surviving apple tree. Adventures with the Eldest Daughter Eight Years Old We will ride in flying machines, To Hillville. Then we will ride in autos of gold To the cross roads. Then we will ride on the backs of mice To a flour mill. Then we will ride on tremendous clouds To nowhere, Thus we will ride Where the ride is the whole adventure. And then on our tiptoes across the still small nursery, On past the babies' cribs and the toys so funny, We will step through the flowered Chinese wall paper, Instantly to where the dragons caper, Instantly To somewhere, somewhere, somewhere. A place where they live on citron and tea and cinnamon, And the Chinese Polly always wants a cracker. The Lotus under the Pacific There is a Lotus, under the sea, Near to land, in the channel sand, But the currents come from so far away The Lotus knows what all seas say; There is a Lotus under the sea, It glitters there, by galleon loot, And the end of the rainbow comes to the root. And the fruit of the flower is a dream of light, And the Lotus is gold, and ivory-white, And the Lotus, by love, may be plainly seen: True hearts may watch the fine flower sway, If they stroll by the shore or swim in the bay. It was born from the touch of your fairy hand, When on your first deep-swimming day, You dared the channel and crossed the bay, And touched for the first time deep-sea sand, And saw where the galleon jewels stay, And the first time lost all sight of the land. ROSES Now there are roses in the rocks If you will cut the rocks in two. And there are roses in the rings If you will saw the oaks in two. And there are roses on great boughs In orchards where the spring is new. And there are roses on the thorns Of every hedge the wide world through! The Bohunk and the Dolly Out of a dried-up cabbage patch, Out of a farm with a queer Hunk name, Out of a cabbage gone to grief, A lovely cabbage dolly came, A plume upon her pale-green curls, A voice like small celestial pearls, Oh, shrill and sweet It would waken flowers Dead for centuries or hours. She had a masterful way with her That would the beetle thugs disarm, And scare bad pups and crows away, And make the whole world jump and play, Except Of course The Hunk who owned the farm. Young Man Jumping Jack Young man jumping jack, He jumped low. Young man jumping jack, He jumped high. And young man jumping jack, He jumped back. And young man jumping jack touched the sky. And young man jumping jack Wasn't so slow. The Warning Flying straight at me With an air of alarm, With uplifted finger To warn me of harm, The autumn leaf said: “The wild rose is dead. Beware, lest her ghost Break your window tonight, And tear down the curtains And put out the light, And snatch you away To the snow where she lies, With ice in her breast Over her eyes.” The Fairy Land I saw the great fountain, Away off fairyland, That sends down the rain. There in the fountain there Stood a proud lady Jane. And I stood in my vision and Shouted to Jane, “Come in out of the rain.” She said, “This is Fairyland. We don't mind the rain.” Rouse Up, You Lazy Salamanders “Rouse up, you lazy salamanders, And leap into the fire.” Shout their bold commanders, Cracking their whips with ire. Who are their bold commanders, Astride their sweating backs? The Fighting Frog The frog who swam Around the world Waving a thorn In one webbed hand And saved his friend, The eel, from slaughter Received for his reward For breakfast, The eel's son and daughter. The Orchid The orchid with the eagle claw Climbed the breadfruit tree Swaying in the Southern night And squeezed it all the year Clung with dreadful eagle claw Till most of the breadfruit died But the orchid bloomed in pride. Peacock Epigram The curled moons in the peacock plumes Declare that there are things Beyond the thoughts of Merlin In the vanities of Kings. Buzz-Saws Who does the sawing under the seas? The sword-fishes saw Whatever they please, The sharks, the crabs, the giant trees It took a million years to grow, And the mermaids weep when they saw them so. When the sun sinks hissing into the ocean, The sword-fishes come With squealing commotion, And while the sun's in a dying state, They saw his gold into pieces of light. Playing Card Drawing The dog was quite vexed To see the rat stand With fire in his eye And a knife in his hand. The dog was quite mad To see the rat stop And shake a brave paw Like a bum at a cop. The Cat Pegasus The good cats have a Pegasus, A proud ghost, very strong. He will not teach the cats to fly, Nor teach them song. His opera is excellent, His monologues are great, Ranging from orator Saving his native state To an actor speaking East Lynne lines In a way to carry weight. And he can carol manfully, Higher than this and higher, Outdoing Wagner even in The Song of The Magic Fire. And though this cat can sing like men And the kittens ride his back, Hoping to learn the notes his way, He keeps their voices slack. He wants to be the only cat In Heaven that sings, and then He loves their tortured hopeless hope To be at last like men! Cork-Bird Picture Said the ostrich to the chicken, “Your outlook must be poor. Why do you scratch for worms About this cottage door?” Said the chicken to the ostrich, “Refrain from verbal knocks. I'd rather live on worms Than nails and rocks.” The Unexpected Door Yesterday when we walked up the hill We found an unexpected door. We knocked there once, Then four times more. The door opened. And we saw a place Lighted by a fairy's holy face. She flew before us like a light, And brought us to a room Where there were one hundred giants Sitting in a row dressed in white. Every giant read a different book, His own diary In there was proud to look. Every giant seemed quite alone, Every giant read his book with love, Yet turned upon his neighbors look of stone. You said: “These must be literary men.” I said: “The fairy is your sweet soul then. See, she is bringing gems to us And flowers unknown to men.” The Mouse Pegasus The best mice have their Pegasus, As well as the best rats. The Pegasus of mice is small But can outfly the bats. He can run streaks and he can shoot Like a star-beam through the night, And squeal a heart-transfixing tune, And is a delicate sight. Boys, you must not despise this bird Because you can hear a louder noise Coming through the radio. Mice must have their joys As well as husky boys. One Boaster Said Mr. Mountain Goat, “Pray note! I can butt better Than a sheep-ram.” Just then he met A catamount Who ate him like a Slice of ham. Another Boaster “Ba Ba,” said the proud old battering ram, “I can butt better than a goat.” Just then a farmer sheared him well, And sold his wool to make a coat. The Independent Thomas He would slip through the brush and the thorn, Treating the scratches with scorn. He would slide through a perilous street, Emerging both haughty and neat. The Calico Tom took the town In a jacket of orange and brown. But we gave him his supper in vain. He walked in the woods in the rain. He slipped through the woods on the ice, Out-skating the shadows and mice. A Meritorious Villainous Baker-Man A villain with a big mustache And ears just like a devil, Nevertheless, when selling pies Was strictly on the level. The Yap Yap and the Clap Trap Says the Yap Yap to the Clap Trap, “Why do you grow so big?” Says the Clap Trap to the Yap Yap, “By eating like a pig.” Rhyme for the Turkeys There were fine great wigwams By the river, And five tremendous turkeys appeared With gobble-gobbles wicked and weird And struttings marvellous and vain. These turkey gods that the Indians feared Pitched the wigwams into the river, And ate the Indians like small grain. A Big-Eared Rat A big-eared rat once heard a cat, A mile away or more. Alas the rat was eaten By a cat next door! The Illinois State Mews A kitten ran a paper: The Illinois State Mews, To please his kitten friends And air his kitten views. One editorial said: “Young pigeons Are good to eat.” Another one said: “Always light On your feet.” Grandma Graymalkins Grandma Graymalkins Has a long nose, She follows it Wherever she goes. What Happened in the Town of Gosh (Gosh is a well-known town in India.) There is an elephant far away, In the jungles of India, flowery and gay; This elephant leads his tribe through the wood, To find all the spinach to eat that is good. He leads away from the haunts of men All young elephants in his ken. For once his great-uncle came too near To the town of Gosh, Men cut off his rear, And took him to Barnum all forlorn, And Barnum fed him pop and popcorn, And put a gold earring in one ear. The Butterflies Showing Off The snail and the butterflies Ran a race. The butterflies flew All around the place. And did the snail beat them? No, they left him behind At the very last minute, Which was proud and unkind. The White Rose and the Butterfly The white rose and the butterfly Met in the wind and the weather, They faced the sunset and the night, And looked at the clouds together. A Mud Hen A mud hen exacting and conscientious Was full of prunes And quite contentious. She would peck you, Being quite contentious, But lay good eggs, Being conscientious. The Crane The crane flew by the pepper bush As the evening star was dim. The Invisible Flowers There are flowers That stand still all day, And invisible flowers that fly, Boats of the air, That float To the sun, And are seen By the spiritual eye. The Mouse The mouse sat writing poems for the humming birds to carry To the mouse in an adjoining house He hoped to marry. The Red Ant The red ant sat on the sugar lump And called the black ant names And made a public matter Of all her secret shames. The Dazzling Bird A dazzling bird of high degree sat sitting on her nest. The seven purple eggs beneath Made music in her chest. The Reed that Loved the Wave A reed loved a wave On the edge of Michigan Lake. I saw the wave, leap, And I saw the reed break. Round, Round the Montain Flew Round, round the mountain flew The happy lovers, two by two; Green and purple, vair and gold, Glowed the mountain and each wing. Toward it, a chameleon, An opal phosphorescent thing. What was on the mountain top, The picture does not say, And I have never been there And am not on the way. The Swan with the Crown Your wedding day to hail, Bringing fairy mail, The swan with the crown Came gliding out of the nursery tale, Swimming down the Sangamon river, And under him swam a swan with a crown. A swan Upside down, Swimming down the Sangamon river, Dressed in feathers, snowy and pale. My Sixty-First Poem on the Moon “The moon's a little planet, With a hundred dried-up seas. If we were there, we could not breathe; And if we stayed, we'd freeze.” Thus spoke the lean astronomer With the mossy locks of grey. He had a long brass telescope, A truly learned way. “The clouds are carpets,” Said his pretty little son. “This evening I will climb the roof, And take a ride on one.” “The moon's a big brass door I'll open wide, And look into the nursery, And see what's on the floor.”</field>
