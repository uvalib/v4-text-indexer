      <field name="fulltext">THE FREDONIAD: OR, INDEPENDENCE PRESERVED. AN EPICK POEM ON THE LATE WAR OF 1812. DEDICATION. TO GENERAL LAFAYETTE. I pausedâbut the pause was momentaryâIt was not possible to hesitate long in selecting a name, through which to introduce my poem to the publick. What name, registered among the benefactors of mankind, stands so conspicuous, at this time, as the name of Lafayette? Our Washington, our Franklin, our Adams, our Jefferson, are no more: And you, by an immense ocean rolling between us, appear like one honoured with posthumous immortality. Though, recently, we have beheld the benignity of your countenance, and heard the effusions of your soul, ardent as the prayers of martyrs, for the emancipation of man from the oppressive burdens of cruel, licentious taskmasters, under the titles of kings and emperors,âstill that countenance, and that voice, is beheld and heard no more. But our memory is full of thee. Your swordâyour maiden sword, was drawn in the cause of liberty, when liberty was a stranger upon the earth. You are one of those illustrious sages and patriots, who achieved the independence of my country,âthen, who so worthy as yourself, to receive the dedication of a poem, founded upon a war, waged for the maintenance of that independence? A war, which terminated in gloryâwhich gave a new splendour to the Star of Freedom. Cruel divisions stalked abroad in the land. One arm of the Republick was pinioned by Faction. With but a SINGLE arm, we smote the enemy. But that ARM, through the smiles of a Divine Providence, was sufficient. It was sufficient to bring the foe to a sense of the indignity of his conduct. We asked for nothing further. We desired no other acknowledgment. We obtained itâwe obtained it with honour. Peace visited thy beloved America, while the ocean was blazing with our victories, and our standards were waving over fields to be treasured in immortal memory with those of Brandywine, Monmouth, and Yorktown. Alas, how deep, how cruel have been your sufferings! And for what?âfor the love of liberty,â for the love you have borne to the fatherless and the widow in affliction,âfor the love and sympathy you have borne to your fellow men!âI will not mention the dungeon of Olmutzâits very name will associate images too keenâtoo severe for reflection. The poem has cost me many an aching, burning thought. For the last eight years, before the rising of the sun, have the efforts of my soul been engaged upon the subject, and the flicker of the midnight lamp found me in communion with the invisible Genius of Poesy. I feel that many are its imperfections. Doubts and deep shadows hang over it: But whether it shall meet with smiles, or frowns, one consoling reflection will still nestle in my bosom:âIt has afforded me a publick opportunity of expressing my love, veneration, and gratitude to a man, whose soul is libertyâwhose bosom is benevolence. RICHARD EMMONS. Great Crossing, Scott County, Kentucky, March 22d, 1827. PREFACE. Were I not convinced of the feebleness of apologists to induce the publick to pass with tender forbearance over the imperfections of an author, I might possibly be inclined to try the experiment: I could inform them that the poem owed its birth to a sudden impulse of feelingâno previous meditation expended upon the subject; what the mind supplied at the moment, was measured into numbers: I could enlarge upon an entire ignorance of the language of poetry, and of epick composition: I could dwell upon meagre povertyâthat cramper of the soul often compelling me to hurry over scenes, on which to have lingered would have been delicious to my fancy. But, without apologies, the poem is presented to the publick. I plead for no indulgence, beyond what must naturally flow from the very nature of the undertaking,âthe most difficult of all difficulties to accomplish:âwere I to ask it, I feel that I should be somewhat like a criminal pleading mercy from the hand of the executioner. What I have written is my own,âand I alone am to answer for its imperfections,âhence I have no obligations of favours received, to bestow upon any man. It is true, in the course of my labours, I have communicated the subject of the poem to several citizens of the Republick eminent for their literature;âbut silence was their only answer, or cold indifference, or damping discouragement. From these general remarks, however, I am enabled to make, at least, one conspicuous exception, âand I do it with the richest feelings hovering around my heart:âthis exception is no other than Francis E. Goddard, formerly President of the South College of Kentucky. This gentleman saw the production in its original deformityâbefore a line had been transcribed, and was not displeased, considering it an outlineâa poem in its rude state of germination. He encouraged me to cultivate and improve it. I have done so. The publick must decide whether it be a lily or a bramble; an oak, or an upas. An author will be judged by the merits of his performance: no difference, what prompted him to action âno difference, what the purity of his designs, âthe degradation of vice, the exaltation of virtue; the love of country, the fatality of faction, or the glorious triumph of a united, patriotick People: No, not this, his purity of intentions, will avail, unless supported by originality of thought, lucid description, majesty of sentiment, the melting pathos, and the lofty sublime. The publick never receives humbleness of submission in mitigation of weakness and errour, in consequence of which, apologies are answered with the sneers of contempt; hence, if the work itself should be hissed at, I am determined that nothing of the serpent-tongue shall be heard in the preface. I feel but little solicitude, however, but that I shall be treated with impartial favour by gentlemen acquainted with the almost insurmountable labours of the task, which I have attempted to performâespecially when they contemplate the recency of the event, on which I founded my poem. A new poem is like new wine,âit wants age to wear off its asperities, and give luxury to its flavour. An impartial critick will stand upon an eminence âfifty years in advance, when the poet shall be sleeping on his bed of dust,âhis characters harvested by the scythe of Time,âthus translated in futurity, divesting himself of the canker of prejudice, he will ask this question: Is it poetry? I might go on now to explain the moral and other circumstances of the work,âbut those, who cannot distinguish cities, when placed in a map before them, will receive little benefit from geographical description. RICHARD EMMONS. Great Crossing, Ky. Sept. 23, 1826. N. B. By the author's residing in Kentucky, he has been deprived of the advantage of revising the proof sheets; hence many typographical errours may appear in the course of the work, arising from some obscure parts of the manuscript. The author has also lost the privilege of introducing such improvements, as no doubt would have occurred to him, had more favourable circumstances indulged him with the opportunity of attending to the publication of the poem. VOL. I. CANTO I. DESCRIPTION OF HELL. ARGUMENT. Subject proposed .... Invocation ..... Description of Hell ..... Congregation of the Infernal Multitude ..... The King and his Nobility set forward to the Hall of Council .... The Court of Hell. The scene is laid in Hell. The time is part of one day, during the winter previous to the declaration of war. Of loud, impetuous War, whose brazen tongue Hath round the borders of Columbia rung, Wag'd to maintain the freedom of the sea, And Independence,ârighteous Liberty,â I venturous sing,âwhich made Britannia feel A blow, that caus'd her stubborn joints to kneel. O Thou immaculate, supernal Power! To whose dread altitude no thought can towerâ Who spake the word,âand Time began to roll, And Space to stretch his arms, and clasp the whole; Whose culminated eye, at glance, descries The wheeling orbs through vast immensities; Who, on the universe, erect'st Thy throne, Thy ways enshrin'd within Thyself, alone; Who, to the sea, the earth, hast all things given, Breathing to all the vital breath of Heaven; Whose span encompasses creation round, And on whose finger hangs the dread profound; Who form'd the nations of the mouldering dust, And rul'st them dark, mysterious, awful, just; Who will'd, and lo! forth sprang a self-pois'd world! Before whose mind eternal, is unfurl'd The round of ages in the womb of night; Whose care upholds the sparrow in its flight; Who rid'st on whirlwinds through the reddening sky; Whose omnipresence fills immensity! Thou, in whose hand the depths of oceans roll; Whose breath is life,âwho breath'd th' immortal soul,â Inspire my Muse!âwash pure her mental sight In the clear fountains of the streams of light, That she may guide me through each changing sceneâ Through light, or shade,âtempestuous, or serene, That I may walk, where mortal never trodâ Where angels dwell in presence of their God,â Or deep descend in Hell's black vaults, below, Where ghosts are heard to wail despairing woâ Or, on the earth, describe the fiery field, Where marshall'd hosts Death's mortal gauntlets wieldâ Or, in the senate, plead the righteousness Of Independence, till its laws shall bless The far-off nations, bent upon their knee, Grovelling in darkness, blind to Liberty. Through all these scenes, dread Power! illume the way, And pour upon my soul celestial day. My verse may clang, when shrill the trumps resound, Or noisy rumble, when the drums rebound; Or with the turbulence of battle swell, When bombs explode, or thundering cannons peal; Or warble sweet, like Philomel in love, When Beauty weeps, or soft affections move. Far, far beyond where darts the arrowy lightâ Below the confines of eternal nightâ Descending, thence, where dungeon Chaos reignsâ Below, where fiends carouse, broke loose their chainsâ Deep, deeper still, down, down, sunk down below, Hell's awful empire opens with its wo. Stretch'd far and wide, before the aching sight, Is seen, by doubtful shreds of scatter'd light, A barren heath, long, dreary, waste, and wild, Where nothing lives, save that, which earth defil'd. From chasms deep, black fire and smoke burst forth, Which roll in heavy columns to the north. Nor tree, nor plant, finds root upon the plains, Save such as rack the soul with sweating pains: The baleful upas spreads its poisons round; Thorns, thistles, nightshade, hemlock, all abound. The bat here riots in congenial gloom, Nor dreads the herald star, whose beams illume The skirts of morning, intermix'd with gold, His murky vision blinding to behold. Pestiferous pools, alive with scorpions, swarm With all the creeping things, which earth deform. The owl, on blasted tree, hoots lonesome drear; On heavy wing, the vulture circles near; Serpents, enrag'd, convolve in slippery maze, Their sanguine eyes shoot hell in horrid blaze. Far to the east, beyond these monsters dire, The ocean foams with cataracts of fire. The waters, black and deep, no plummets sound, Spreading immense, illimitable round. Now, whirling indolent, with motion slow The reeling waves in drunken mazes flow; But where, like smoothing oil, they seem to glide, The rocks of shipwreck in close ambush hide. Now, without cause perceiv'd, the billows swell, Chafe, rage, break, thunderâdire the spirits yell, Riding the foam, to hell's dread concave toss'd; In flashing clouds of fire the fighting floods are lost. Deep in the west, the smoky mountains rise, Where the pain'd ear attends the piteous cries Of miserable ghosts, fast-chain'd below In utter darkness and eternal wo, For crimes committed from the reach of law, Who practis'd virtue never, but from awe: The wretch, that squander'd life in listless hours, Is scourg'd to labour, while he sweats in showers; No vain excuse of golden moments lost Avails him aught,âin misery toils the ghost. The pale Intemperate is at length made full Of maddening poison from a brimming skull: If he refuse acceptance of the bowl, A lash of scorpions scourges to his soul. The Tyrant, who from Africk's bondage son Had made his blood in burning streams to run, Unceasing writhes beneath the goring lashâ Stung with the pain, his eyes distorted flash; Hands clinch'd, he bites his flesh,âhis teeth hard setâ His heart, with struggling, oozes bloody sweat. The fawning, cringing Hypocrite, appears By the pale glimmer, like wan night in tears: Oft had he stung his brother with a smile, And strove his God, with fastings, to beguile; But now no smiles his inward devil cloak, For round his neck tight strangling adders choke. He, who had murder'd life with felon games, Wallows, deep-plung'd with Infamy, in flames. A dreaming phantom ever haunts his head; He thinks he hears his children cry for bread; His wife, with naked bosom in despair, Seems to be hovering in the troubled air; Her sorrowing plaint forever uttering forth, How she was made a beggar on the earth! The deep-ey'd Traitor in lone gloom is cast, His naked bosom scorching in the blast. His features shrink; his eyes with torture glare, And not a devil, damn'd, will deign to view him there. Here the gaunt Miser is at length supplied With that, for which he, worse than beggar, died. In mines of hell he labours, void of rest; And all, from whom he wrung his interest, Rush to his view, and mock him in his grief, And show the mite, they crav'd him for relief. He works, and sweats, and tugs, and groans, and digs, Whilst gold, in heavy chain, with fainting nerve he drags. Near this wan ghost, another, rack'd, appears, Who oft from virtue's eye wrung bitter tears. The spotless virgin by his poisonous breath Was stain'd to blackness, like the tinge of deathâ Slander, his name!âa double murderer, fell, Who touch'd the earth with something that was hell: But now his tongue is fastened with a wire, To redness heated by the sharpest fire. Next the Seducer, with sunk eye, is seenâ His flesh, all wasted, shows a haggard mien, As though a secret fire his veins possess'd, And a slow worm had fed upon his breast. He boasts no more of his deceptive wiles, Nor bears the serpent devil in his smiles. His heart consumes, for blighting to decay The fairest flowers, that ever blush'd at day. Unnumber'd others send loud wailings forth, For damning crimes, committed on the earth. Some are condemn'd to drag a clanking chain, And, as they drag it, feel a dying pain; Some, hard to climb the mountain's slippery steep O'er beetling rocks, where starting dragons sleep, But, ere they reach the shuddering height, they fall And roll o'er beds of fireâin vain for mercy call. On these dread heights, the monarchy of hell And peers, around in dark pavilions, dwell, Fashion'd of thunder clouds, through which, half seen, They show, at intervals, their hideous mien! Full in the centre of this world of blood Boils the lake, brimstone, melted to a flood, Whose tossings dire convulse th' infernal ground, Like thousand Ãtnas' congregated sound. Full twice ten hundred leagues its limits spread, By mountains, wall'd, of burning summits dread. Deep at its base, in doubtful lines, confess'd By flickering fires, that glance athwart its breast, Appears the restless surge, like ocean drunk, When to their prison-house the winds have shrunk. A thousand cubits from the mountain's height, Ebb'd hath the lakeâa sepulchre of night! But the cragg'd mountain sides, with fire o'erglaz'd, Show where of late the lava had been rais'd, What time the fiend-borne cloud from ocean came, And, with its tempests, rous'd its smother'd flame. When full it swells beyond the mountain wall, Then fiery rivers down its chasms fall, Which o'er the crusty soil a deluge spread, Plunging o'er cataracts with deafenings dread. Slow from the ocean, at the morning hour, Fiends of huge fashion,âhands of giant power,â A cloud, roll onward from the coast of hell, In which pent tempests in concealment dwell. Dark, as the cloud they on their wings convey, Thunders are heard, and lightnings seen to play. They poize it o'er the lake: th' expanding heat Explodes the tempests, which, in whirlwinds, beat Dire on the surface of the burning sea, Which hurl the flames through hell's vacuity; Like hair-thread lightnings, on the cloud, they spread; Or, like the fire, that quickens from the dead, Which throws a kind of daylight o'er the waste, Like to the moon, when, lurid from the east, She rises half eclips'd, while many a murky cloud Darkens her face, all dabbled o'er with blood. During the period that computes a day, Fierce rush the tempests with impetuous sway; But when the magazine of winds is spent, The fiends return it to its element, Where they recharge it with the ocean's breath, The flames to kindle of the lake of death. When back the cloud is to the ocean hurl'd, A pall-black darkness wraps the Stygian world. Thick-column'd smoke rolls suffocating forth, And spreads deep night through west, and east, and north; The shriekings then, that echo from the lake, Cause e'en the heart of iron hell to ache. These ghosts delighted in the waste of blood, But now they, struggling, swim the surging flood. Through wild ambition, they with earth made war, And smil'd to see the vultures round their carâ Who, in their frenzy, thought their triumphs spread, When beasts of prey howl'd o'er their mangled dead. Plac'd opposite this torrid zone of hell, Far to the north, eternal shiverings dwell. Here icy mountains huge are pil'd in height, So vast, their summits reach beyond the sight; Compar'd to which, the Andes, Thibet, Blanc, Were they beside them plac'd, as dwarfs would rank, Shrunk to brief hills; their rivers, broad and deep, To spring-shower brooks, that from the fountains leap. Their bleak, cold, dreary heads shoot far and wide Above the smothering clouds, which on them ride. Deep in their bowels, struggling thunders sound To burst their prison in the depths profound. The dungeon fires, close pent, at times explode, And the foundations, from their fix'd abode, Toss into emptiness with crashing sound, Spreading ten thousand thousand ruins round; Piling new mountains, where the channels deep Pour down the fiery streams from steep to steep. Restless, ere long, they thunder to the height, Where darkness reigns, and make their former site: Thus mountains tumble in confusion vast, Confounding hell at each tremendous blast. In these waste regions of unsparing death, Not e'en a fiend can breathe the freezing breath; But when condemn'd here dreadful to abide, His limbs contract,âheart shrinks,âhis powers are dead, Save th' undying worm, which, hungry, gnaws His vitals deep,âblood dropping from its jaws; While, like a serpent frozen on the earth, The frenzied eyeballs from his head start forth. Near the dread confines of this suffering world, Where souls, corrupted by their sins, are hurl'd, A swallowing pit gapes yawning, broad and deep, 'Neath which th' infernal peers their councils keep. A vapour, nauseous, from the chasm streams, Which far more loathsome to the nostril seems, Than that from charnel vault of dead men green, Whilst, crawling round the corse, black hungry worms are seen. This throat of hell, ten dragons, jealous, guard To keep inferiors from the consult barr'd. Chains, link'd with adamant, confine them there, Circling ten leagues,âa region waste and bare. Their orbs severe flash withering death around, And when they move, the lowest depths resound. And, should a fury dare invade their path, Dreadful they show their violence of wrath; Their bristling backs take fire in raving mood; Their foaming jaws spout flames,âblack, boiling blood; Their anger, maddening with a hideous yell, Their brazen throats crack granite vaults of hell. Now Stygian night prevails. But soon, is seen By lightning's glimpse, at intervals, the mien Of those, who bear the cloud of winds along, And thunders far remote are heard with lumbering tongue. Near and more near, it gains upon the lake; And now, upon its breast, the tempests break, Causing the flaming mass to surge on high, Which makes a glimmering pale through hell to fly; Such as earth's night, when troubled ghosts appear, Riding, on bloody clouds, the sickly sphere. Now when the lake had thinn'd the solid night, And brought Tartarian day with darken'd light, The souls, condemn'd, arose to work their painâ And dire is heard the clanking of their chain. The monarch-fiend, upon the mountains west, These, to his train of agent powers, express'd: âPeers of immortal birth!âThis day, 'tis Ours To plan the crushing of Columbian powersâ The death of infant Liberty effect, And, on its grave, a royal throne erect. âOur agents, twenty winters absent there, By our command, have left the fields of air, Ready they, now, the tidings to declareâ Avarice, fair Luxuryâwith whom was sent Hard Cruelty, with griefs to make them faint. âForthwith a weighty council We shall hold In silent hell, and there Our views unfold. Never no more would Freedom raise her brow, Should We succeed Columbia to subdue; A long, long farewell would her exit be, And kings would sway the earth from sea to sea; Kingsâwho from Us their titleship receiveâ Through Us they reignâthrough right divine they live. âHerald! go forth! alarm the host of hell, Loud, through its confines, let your trumpet swell. Bid them, Our subjects, without pause, to fly Near to those plains the dragons occupy. Bid them obsequious on their knee to bow, Or they the kindling of Our wrath shall know. Go, speed your flight, obey Our awful nod, All hell shall know, Ourself am ruling god!â He ended scornful with a lowering look, His tongue still heard, though thunder's voice had spoke. The herald forth, his massive trumpet seiz'd With hands that seem'd with hardening mineral glaz'd; Its walls of unsmooth'd iron, strengthen'd round With biting hoops, in brazen circles bound. He spreads his pinions on the smoky air, And wheels his way through regions of despair; Plying the bellowing clarion to his mouth, Noising a blast more furious than the south, When from the ocean, storm'd, it drives the rains, And sweeps destructive o'er the harvest plains. Millions attend the sound! astonish'd, quake To hear the clangour of the trumpet break: âYe multitudes of hell!âyour king attend! Your every thought, in low abasement, bend! ââHerald! go forth!âalarm the host of hellâ Loud through its confines let your trumpet swell. Bid them, Our subjects, without pause, to fly Near to the plains the dragons occupy. Bid them obsequious on their knee to bow, Or they the kindling of Our wrath shall know. Go,âspeed your flight,âobey our awful nod, All hell shall know Ourself am ruling god!â âWaken! arise! let none his speed delay To do him honour passing on his way.â This said, he blew a blast so loud and strong, It shook vast Erebus, and rous'd the throng. By hundreds, thousands, millions, thick they pour With sound, like ocean rolling on the shore, Or driving whirlwinds howling from the north, Or distant thunders rumbling round the earth. South of the pit, beyond the guarding chains, In desert wildness, stretch the dragon plains. Beyond the compass of the eye they reach, Like wasteful ocean, seen from some high beach. Here the vast multitudes collecting, form, Like congregating clouds, in brewing storm. In dismal swarms they stifle up the air, Like cinder'd dust, when Ãtnian thunders jar. Grim on the heath they stand:âTwo ranks are seen, To centre fac'dâa vacancy between. Close files, in press, behind each other, stand, And stretch in martial phalanx o'er the land. As insect millions darkening buz around; As army worms, that eat the herbag'd ground; As locust swarming on the Africk shore, So, in thick crowds, hell's legions blackening pour. A mountain, restless, beetling on the right, Supports th' infernal thunder on its height, Gaping with horrid mouth, like yawning cave, Deep, drear, and dismal as creation's grave. The engine huge an hundred furies ply, And scarce its vault two heavy tons supply. Nice through the vent they pour the flaming dust, T' excite th' imprison'd mass with bellowing burst, Ready at signal to receive the spark, When king and nobles on the clouds they mark. High on a spiry clift, a sentry stands To watch the coming of the royal bands, And give due notice when the Power is seen, Through the blunt rays, which grim with death his mien. Sharpening his sight, though riveted his eye, He marks the Fiend in dim obscurity; The sentry knows him by the stars of blood, Which circle round his front in horrid mood. His flag he waves in token of the king! The match-fire hissing to the vent they bringâ It flames!âexploding lightnings glance the ground, Infernal thunders rend the void profound, Like thousand earthquakes' congregated sound. The rude concussion strikes the ear so fell, The host Tartarian with convulsions yell, Which echoes back from all the caves of hell! So dire the shock, it jarr'd the sceptred arm, And Night and Chaos startled with alarm. Arriv'd: the monarch lights upon the plain With all his retinue, a baleful train. The vassal powers, in homage to their king, Cower in the dust, and shade them with their wing, Whilst peals with deafenings from the engine swell, Not crush of mountains is a parallel. He comes, gigantick, haughtily along, And passes through between th' adoring throng. His eyes look burning caves beneath his brows, Which, like black rocks, half hide the fire, that glows Like flames o'er mouldering tombs; they wan appear, Or, like the moon, when blood bedims her sphere. He seems in stature like a moving tower, Or craggy mount, round which the wild storms lower. A flaming sceptre in his hand he holds, Huge, like a fir, that breaks the clouds in folds. When, with their pains, the damn'd of earth expire, He quickens them to life with touch of fire, Which with such agony cramps every pore, That all their pangs were happiness before! When round he wields it, dumb his subjects bow With kneeling reverence to his rock-stern brow: For power has he to stifle in their breath, And make them feel a never-dying death. A shapeless covering on his head is seen, Adding a tenfold horrour to his mienâ A something like a hill, cumber'd with oak, Sing'd bare and blasted by a thunder-stroke. Round the dead limbs, a thousand serpents crawl, From whose rank mouths hot poisons dripping fall. Hard, tyrant kings, with crowns upon their brows, Hang as the fruit of the infernal boughs. Drops of that blood, which rioting they shed, Wasting the earth with besom armies dread, Daily come trickling from their naked hearts, Quivering with pain, transfix'd with fiery darts. On as he strides, he nothing bends his eye, So little he regards the millions by; But they, sense-blinded, think they freedom feel, When they to sovereignty obsequious kneel; As Albion subjects crouch before their king, While anthem strains of Liberty they sing. Luxury, with simpering, moves upon his rear; Avarice, Cruelty, in lock'd hand, appear. Dull, yawning Sloth, with pain creeps slow along With limbs, loose-dangling, every nerve unstrung. Malice, with murdering scowl, grinds hard his teeth, While his blood-eyeballs shoot the glance of death. Pale, pining Envy, rack'd with festering care, Pursues behind, with scorpions round his hair, Hissing with flaming tongues, and spirting far A bath of poison through the scorching air. Delirious Anger in his fury storms; A passion'd wildness all his shape deforms. He locks his iron fist, he foams, he stamps, Whilst hard his brow with deep convulsion cramps. Then soul-burnt Jealousy, with haggard mien, Through all the train in dire distraction's seen; He moves at times, with clouded silence sour, Then, black with wrath, he frights the Stygian power. Next the grim form of Anarchy comes forth, The worst of fiends that ever hell gave birth. An hundred heads his brawny shoulders bear, Whose iron tongues, like war-dogs, yell despair. His hand, gouted with blood, sustains a dart, Its point deep-driven through a quivering heart. Brown speckled adders in his bosom breed, And on the rankness of his vitals feed. Others, of royal grade, compose the band, To whom inferiors, prostrate, lick the sand. At length the Fiend the countless multitude Pass'd, on his way,âlike leaves of autumn, strew'dâ So vast,âto place them by each tyrant throne, Which round the circle of the world is known, Would be as insects, millions quickening forth, To man, slow-breathing, lingering in his birth. To Albion, Denmark, Russia, add the Gaul, Collecting subjects, thousands at a call; Let Turkey congregate her crescent band; China, innumerous as the dust of sand; Yea, let these kingdoms multiply their host, Till crowding numbers in the mind is lost, Yet their full sum, to the Infernal's sway, Would measure as a drop, when added to the sea. He to the herald thus: âGo, and proclaim This Our command, and seal it with Our name. Bid subject hell to fly from yonder heath, Or be prepar'd to fall Our wrath beneath!â On the thick element, the herald hung, And loud his clarion through the confines rung: âBehold, the summons of the throne I bearâ Lo, these his words he bade me to declare; Them, when I publish, rise! âGo and proclaim This Our command, and seal it with Our name. Bid subject hell to fly from yonder heath, Or be prepar'd to fall Our wrath beneath!â âPause notâbut vanishâdart upon the wing, Or on your heads a rain of fire he'll fling.â They heard the message with a silent awe; They rise, like shouting armies in a war, Darkening the flames ascending from the lake, While their deep throats the dismal regions break, Which, with the flickering motion of each wing, Smite the rock-caverns with an echoing. Betimes, each shapes his course a several way, Some to ride tossing on the uproar'd sea; To dens of serpents some, or brake, or cave, Bordering the deep, where maniac monsters rave. With cautious step, the Stygian peers pursue The Fiend to reach the hall, erected new In second hell beneath, where voice, or sound, Is never heard; still as the spectred ground, Where, wrapp'd in mouldering sheets, the dead are laid, And naught but eating worms the ear invade, Save when a joint gives way, and then a bone, Loose, falling from its socket, makes a tone Sound through the vault, breaking the silence deep, As though the dead were starting from their sleep. Soon they approach upon the Dragons' ground; They smell the scent of blood! and, at a bound, Reach the dire spot, where all the train are found! Their deep-mouth howl is like when thunder breaks, Or when earth, yawning with convulsion, shakes. From brandish'd tails, sharp arrowy lightnings blaze; Each ball of fire, a pestilence displays; Their iron jaws, expanded, hideous low'r, Threatening th' infernals, greedy, to devour. A fire, unquenchable, inflames their wrath, Spouting black blood along their foaming path. The royal retinue terrifick stand With heads reverted, stretching back their hand. Like wild things, chain'd, their shrinking features stare, An icy horrour shivering every hair. âWhence comes this panick of the heart? alarm? Know that protection is your Sovereign's arm! Safety is here beyond their length of chain, Which curbs their further progress on the plain. In idle efforts let their anger burn, Till We from Death's deep cavern shall return.â This caution given, he sought Death's magazine, To search the sweetest morsel lodg'd within. A sweating vault, dimensionless and rude, Forms the dire store-house of the dragons' food. The dismal chamber is supplied by Death, As dying earth surrenders up her breath. At times, life's prowler digs the graves at night, Like those dark workers, that pollute the rite Of church-yard sanctity, and strips away The green, rank flesh, his empty maw to stay; But in this vault he crowds the body whole, And opes the rocky door at Hell's control. The way that travels to this gory cave Is like the dark, damp entrance to a grave, Where dead men slumber in their rotting sheets, Whilst on their heart the worm voracious eats. Now, at this present, Death severely stood, Guarding the pass, that nothing might intrude. Shapeless, disjointed is the monster's Death. form, Like some dark image of the clouds in storm, When slow they heave in broken piles on high, And the dun moon looks sickly from the sky. His wide-stretch'd nostril snuffs the distant earth, When thirsty Carnage drinks hot blood in mirth. His mouth is like the yawning of a tomb, Forever open, ready to consume Whole armies at a meal; yet his lean waist As starvingly appears, as though a taste Never had passed the entrance of his jaw To stay the druling of his ravenous maw. His bones loose rattle as he moves alongâ The cry, âGive! Give!!â sounds hollow from his tongue. The monarch came, and thus the Form address'd, From whose sunk eyeballs steam'd a bloody mist: âOpen the vault!âWe crave thy tenderest food To calm the raving of the dragons' blood. They bar Our progress to the hall beneathâ Open thy treasure! give Us entrance, Death! To throne Columbia calls Us to debateâ But first shall Anarchy convulse the state. Death, hearkening to his voice, severely grins, And, thus in turn, with dismal voice begins, Like that from opening tombs: âMonarch of Hell! It gives me joy to do thy mandates well. Long have I known the secret of thy heart, To break the chain of Liberty apart. When, over Freedom, Anarchy prevails, Then, sweet in air, I snuff the tainted gales; As late transpir'd upon the Gallick shore, Where large I drank the luscious streams of gore. But long hath Freedom with Columbia stood, Nor once supplied me with the wine of blood. âMonarch, go forth, and prosper in thy cause, And let rude Anarchy convulse their laws. A rank division ready hath begun, Hence, I forebode, a crimson tide must run. By the strong workings inward that I feel, Each slaying each will yield a gorging meal. But I debar thee from the vault within.â Open thy jaws, and let the dead be seen!â As stern he spoke, he lifted up his handâ Grating, the rock slow open'd at command. In strides the Fiend! a sepulchre of dead! From babes, unwean'd, to man with hoary head. Each corse he handlesâthis, with smile, selects, While that, more ancient, he with scowl rejects. His hand, coated with blood, draws reeking forth Twice five, infantile, strangled in their birth; Round their writh'd necks the livid spots remain, Their eyes, distorted, struggling with the pain. Death shuts the cavern with a hollow sound, Which stirs the dead, and jars the vaulted ground. Th' Infernal bears the morsels in his hand With rapid stride, and meets the dragon band. Their rage increases at the sight of food, Dripping large drops of cold congealing blood. He hands to each, his passions to allay; Rattling their chains, leaping, they snatch the prey. With iron teeth, they tear the limbs in parts, And craunch the skulls, and rend the quivering hearts; Growling like thunder smother'd in a cloud, Sucking the brains, the marrow, and the blood. Soon they, with druling, gormandize the feast, It damps their fire, and soothes them into rest. They lick their jaws to save the dropping gore, And whining ask the gloomy Fiend for more. The dragons calm'd, their fears at once subside; The train unfaultering in their chief confide; He speaks with hurried voice: âThe time embrace, While, gorg'd with food, the dragons hold their peace; For know, when hunger ravens in their maw, Not hell in safety can withstand the war.â As carrion vultures, when they snuff the scent Of putrid vapour in the firmament, Flap their broad wings to gain the gibbet heath, To riot, feasting on the spoils of death, So fly the Stygian peers!âsnuffing the air, To find the gulf that opens new despair. Now round the throat of hell, they join the Fiend, Through which the reprobate of earth descend, That they, in painful silence, may perceive The conscience worm, and, for their sin-deeds, grieve; And after which, to upper hell they're sent To breathe the flamesâeternal punishment! A ghastly light, wan as the brow of death, Reveals the awful depths, that yawn beneathâ Like pallid beams, descried at midnight, dread Burning in church-yards o'er the mouldering dead. Fast on the precipice th' Infernals stand, Waiting the signal of the monarch's hand, Dreadful to plunge!âIllimitable round Appears the deepness of the void profound, E'en to the eye of fiends, whose prying sight Can reach, at once, beyond the bounds of nightâ A mountain, wonderful as this terrene, To them no larger than a hillock's seen; A river, broad as the Atlantick's sea, Rolling its current sluggishly away, Appears a streamlet moving on their eye, From the dread summit of the clift on high! So, to compare the mighty with the less, As when the moon, eclips'd, in her distress Travels with labour through the weeping sky, Whilst all the stars are dull'd with sympathy;â With purple cast, they glimmer in their sphere, Like strangled blood, when slow the moon crowds near: Behold, a multitude of untomb'd shades Ascend from lonely heaths and murderous glades, And gain the Andes of the struggling moon, Now, in her darkest robes, at night's deep noon; With hollow eyes, from their stupendous height, They ken the earth, dim seen through bloody light, Shrunk to a dwarfâits prospect so remote, Like lines of hair, its mighty streams they note; The oceans, east and west, like spreading blots; Its cloud-rais'd mountains, like inferior dots; Ãtna, Vesuvius, raging in their might, Seem like two sparks, scarce visible of light: As thus the spectres of the moon behold The distant earth with night's damp darkness cold, So, from the throat of hell, the fiends descry The silent realms of hopeless misery. Now, soft the monarch speaks: âLet no one dare To breathe a syllable as he wings the air! This the deep world of spirits, pale and thin, From earth cast headlong for their damning sin. âList to the screams above! through Hell's broad gate, A band approaches to receive their fate! See Horrour, plum'd with scorpions, lash them down! Such vast accessions dignify the Crown! The larger portion of the earth is Ours, Nor shall We pine, if We divide Our powers With heaven supreme!âTo judge by troops that pour, Receive, must We, a host of millions more. âBut look! the damn'd descend! when flit they by, Then, mark Our course, and dumb in silence fly.â He said. An army, black as thunder cloud, Of spirits, sin-condemn'dâa hideous crowd, Fall shrieking in the pit!âForth is replied The shriek, by all that in the realms abide: For when from earth descends a wretched ghost, A pang, fresh added, feel the Stygian host Wide through hell dungeons: There is not, as here, Where more the numbers more the gladdening cheer; Since, more the myriads which the realm contains, The more severe the anguish of their pains. A solitary ghost, that falls from light, Causes a pang which draws the bosom tight, Through the vast confines of the black abode, Straining the eye-balls, till they sweat with blood: To bring the scene familiar to the earth, When hell receives th' accession of a birth, As when a sparkle drops upon a train, Which, rapid kindling to the magazine, Millions of atoms at the instant feel The quickening fire, and all their flames reveal, Causing a dread explosion to rebound Wide through the tortur'd elements profound: So, at the passing of a ghost to hell, Millions of spirits shriek a lengthening yell. Down, headlong plunging through the pit, they fall, Writhing, unutterable, striving to call For miserable aid; alas! in vain! Their tongues are sear'd, their throats are parch'd with pain. Down, down they sink to unknown depths of night, Where the swift plummet never would alight; Never for them a resting place is found, But soon up-whirl'd aloft and scatter'd round, Like arid chaff, when gusty whirlwinds rise And toss the unweigh'd atoms to the skies. They fall, rise, sink, ascend: thus a whole year, By gusts and vacuums scatter'd round the sphere. After this whirl, their conscience stings them dire; A century pass'd, they rise to toil in fire; To climb the slippery mountains; drag the chain, A long eternity,âan endless pain! When Horrour with his whips had lash'd them down, The Fiend, this caution to his train made known. âEach hold his bosom hard. Let no voice loud Break the deep stillness of this solitude. Follow your Sovereign to the council hall, Where We, with art, may plan Columbia's fall.â This said, He plung'd the yawning gulf beneath, Silent, the fiends pursue, as shades of death. Ranging the north, they feel the stiffening cold; Then, to the east, their gloomy way they hold. Dark, deep below, a winding course, they take, And distant hear the rumbling of the lake; Thence, wheeling to the west, while sinking still, And exercising hard their flying skill, Dimly remote, in solid night extreme, They ken the glimmer of a sickly beam. Far in the west, within this grave-yard gloom, Stands the lone mansion, hell's dread council-room. On a bleak isle, surrounded by a waste, The haunted temple of the damn'd is plac'd. Of unwrought iron are its walls compos'd, And by a roof of sun-bleach'd bones inclos'd, Cemented close, impervious to the flood Of raining fire, by hard compacting blood. Ten acres, tripled twice, it circles round, A thousand cubits towers in height profound. The doors, of broken tombs are artful made, In which are skulls, by grinning Death inlaid. A vast Golgotha foams upon the left, Compos'd of numerous armies, life bereft, Fighting in frenzy for the way to heaven; But now to deepest hell the whole are driven; Their smoke of torment in thick clouds appears, Rolling in tortuous volumes round the spheres. The isle is solemn as the place of death, No being near respires a quickening breath, But trooping ghosts flit pallid on the sight, And, through the horrour, show a kind of light. A host of spectres in the mansion dwell, Cast for their sin-deeds to this nether hell. Full in the portal, Murder hideous stands, Warm blood fast dropping from his lifted hands; His crimson right, a dirk convulsive bears, His left is tangled in grey matted hairs. A victim welters, smote his arm beneath, Cramp'd with the last convulsive throe of death. Here the pale shades of highway robbers meet, Cold, wan, and ghastly, in their winding sheet. Coffins, with dead, half seen, bench round the hall, Close-wrapp'd, deep, dreadful with the dungeon pall. A sea of blood rolls round the skull-pav'd floor, Where thousand shadows stoop and slake their thirst with gore. The throne is rais'd upon its northern side, Round which the forms of poisonous serpents glide; As tapestry, suspended are the hearts, Who, for religion, hurl'd the flaming darts Of persecution,âheads,âthe lopp'd-off hands, Which lit the cruel faggots with the brands; Christian, Mahomet, Protestant, or Friar, That cast their brother in the torturing fire. On fifty skeletons, of giant height, Fix'd is the throne, appalling to the sight! Deep in each breast, a cavern dark is seen, Where, in past ages, monarchies had been, Egyptian, Persian, Grecian, and of Rome, The time she totter'd into Luxury's tomb; Yea, all that ever yet disgrac'd the earth, Receiv'd from hell their pestilential birth. At length the Fiend, with his apostate band, Gloomy alights on this dark, spectred land. No breathing utterance heard!âHe moves before, And now he fronts the seven-times bolted door. Heavy and deep, the skulls, inlaid, he knocks; Quick leap the bolts, instinctive, from the locks, The hinges open with a grating sound, Which makes the shadows of the dead start round. The monarch enters! but congealing fear Withholds his band from following on his rear. They blanch with horrour at the deathful scene, And turn their faces backward from within. Lo, as the Tyrant passes up the aisles, The spectres crowd and gaze in trooping files. Pale they escort him to his throne of state, From whence proceed the black decrees of fate. Seated in royalty, with thunder, scar'd, He marks his retinue with threatenings hard. He waves his sceptre, flaming through the air, That forth, they enter, and to seats repair. âAnd have ye not yet learnt, that in Us dwell The whole, concentred, of the strength of hell? Why stand ye manacled in chains of ice? Fill each his station!âNever speak We twice!â Struck with the terrour of his lightning glance, With giant strides, they to their seats advance. Their fears were scatter'd at his regal nod, Their feet are crimson'd, wading through the blood. Full on his right, are Avarice, Luxury, plac'd. His left, with haggard Cruelty, is grac'd. Outlaw'd Anarchy, opposite the throne, Assumes a height, approaching to his own; A pyramid of civil armies slain, Where son and father met upon the plain; Like rivers, swell'd, the widows' tears flood round, While shrieks of orphans echo from the mound. Scowling Revenge receives an honour'd place; Malice, stern Anger, 'gainst him, frowning, face. Envy, Hypocrisy,âthe hellish host, Each takes his seat beside a pallid ghost: A hideous multitude, begrim'd with gore, Nor was the like e'er seen in hell before. CANTO II. HELL. CONTINUED. ARGUMENT. The Court of Hell having convened, they, in various speeches, touch upon the causes of the war, &amp;c. .... In order to carry their plans into execution, they adjourn to the White Mountains. The scene is laid in the Court of Hell. The book consumes the remaining part of the day. Each in distinction plac'd, and tumult still'd, They lean to notice what their sovereign will'd, Who, seated, thus began: âWhy damp'd ye seem? Why do ye doubt Our potency supreme? Knowâthat these spectres tremble at Our nod, Knowâthat we sway the sceptre of a god! âThis royal council We've commanded forth, The better to confirm Our hold on earth. The peers, descended lineal from Our blood, Who, round that sphere, thrice eighty moons have trod, Greet Us, return'd, as We of late express'd On the bleak summits of the mountains west. Their absence they'll describe, and what they've won, If now the strength of Freedom be undone. Let every ear be openâlistening deep, That We may harvest of Our wisdom reap. The matter presses heavy on Our heart, And every peer must bear a weighty part.â He ceas'd. Their voices, shouting through the dome, Resembled thunder in thick midnight gloom. A pause succeeds:âAnd Luxury rises, meek, A deep vermillion laid upon his cheek. His lips are twisted in fantastick grin; His features, smoothâno roughness on his chin. Plates of hard steel upon his ribs are lac'd, Breathing like Asthma in his corselets brac'd. His red eyes roll with a lascivious air, While sister Vanity, with idiot stare, Together with his children, Lust and Gout, Stand gazing on him with their eyes half out. This shape had Luxury.âHis voice is heard: âSovereign of sovereignties! by kings ador'd! Millions on earth before thy sceptre fall, The vast of hell, that walk, or fly, or crawl! â'Tis now the twentieth winter, since that we, By thy direction, pass'd vacuity To regions fill'd with breath. So swift our flight, In days twice nine we gain'd the bounds of light. To Albion's isle, to do thy will, we sped, And brief we stood on Flamborough's chalky head. âThere we these lineaments of hell exchang'd, And, in concealment, through the island rang'd. On, as we hied, we spread our influence round, And every heart to deeds of tyrants bound. Our potent virtues soon the nation felt, The Lords, the Nobles, to our altars knelt. Thy fairest daughter born, my sister Pride, From King, or Council, never was denied; But hail'd adoringly,âhence, rest thou sure, That Albion's friendship ever will endure.â The monarch heard the tidings with a leer Of approbation, as when smiles appear On the grim visages of ghosts, that meet A strangled murderer in his bloody sheetâ Travelling in thunder clouds the path of hell, His neck still purpled, as from life he fell! Now Avarice slow uprears his aged headâ He, who for gold oft strips the shrouded dead. From his stern eye a scalding ichor flows, O'er which his frowning eyebrows partial close. Shrunk in dry wrinkles is his haggard mien; No part of flesh upon his bones is seen; The sinews creak beneath his leprous skin, For want of oil to moisten them within. His heart of iron, cas'd with tripled steel, Regards not pity, or the publick weal. His choicest drink is tears from widows' eyes; His sweetest musick, orphan miseries. His tatter'd vestments round about him fly; His food, the wastings, what the fiends throw by. Standing half bent, as though with age subdu'd, He thus the workings of his mind pursu'd: âDread Deity of Hell! my heart beats high, That thou my ceaseless toils will satisfy. Through me it was they bow'd themselves to gold; Both peer and king, like barter'd things, are sold. My first born offspring Speculation. through the realm I led, Who oft made traffick of the grave-yard dead. Eager they listen'd to the voice I spoke; Their views I cover'd with Religion's cloak. T' acquire their wealth, all virtue is forgot, They draw from those, who worship Juggernaut! Hence, from this cause, the nation will be thine, And then a large division will be mine; Yes, thou wilt then my poverty make blest, By granting mine more bounteous than the rest.â âMore bounteous! how?â Anger tumultuous cries, âMy part is mine, or this deep hell shall rise!â Revenge plung'd forward, frenzied, from his seat, And Envy, Malice, fever'd with their heat. With riot tongues, Anarchy makes strife,â Avarice becomes invisible of life. One 'gainst the other, reckless, drives with ire, Whilst foams the mouth, and nostril streams with fire. This digs the skulls from out the floor beneath, That tears the sleepers from the chests of death. The spectres raise their pallid hands on high, A wild expression staring from their eye! The monarch darkening shook his triple crown, Knitting his features, working to a frown. Soon was express'd the aspect of his form, Black like a tempest, overcharg'd with storm. Two flames, like furnaces, flash'd from his eyes, His voice was broken thunder from the skies: âPeace! be at peace!!ââHe earthquake language spoke, While the deep centre of the island shook. The furies, backward from the strife, retire, T' avoid the blast portentous of his ire. âIf e'er again,â (unalter'd in his rage,) âIf e'er again in battle ye engage, Our uprais'd arm your shrinking hearts shall dread, Your vital chords this sceptre shall unthread! âWhat, not in silent hell can silence be? By oath of gods, We'll break this enmity! What idiot madness to embroil a fight For that which scarcely glimmers on the sight? 'Tis true, some omens favourable appearâ But is there not foreboding cause to fear, That We may lose them, whole, and never more Regain Our grasp upon the sea-girt shore? Another Chatham may excite Our hate, And stay the progress of their downward fate. âWe do not like their charitable deeds, They pain our heartâthe latent, baleful seeds Of growing Virtue, basilisk to our eyesâ This, this will loose the grasping of the prize. Against their temples, that invade the sky, We lift Our hands, or all is vanity; Yea, all is vanity, unless We down These mining virtues to o'erwhelm the Crown. âBut now, inform Us of that stubborn power, From the Pacifick to Atlantick shore; Too well ye know, Columbia is Our theme, Curse on Ourself, that she exists in name! Of others soon We humbled on their knee, But she defies Us with her Liberty. Long have We labour'd to erect a throne, Deep in her bosom, modell'd from Our own. Thus far, Our deep devisings have been vain, No State, as yet, is fetter'd in Our chain. 'Tis time some circumstance by Us was wrought, That they in royal net-work may be caught. âWhen Greece and Rome accepted of a crown, How soon they totter'd to oblivion down: Britannia hangs suspended by a thread, Without Our aid, her very name is dead. âWhat greater curse a nation can befal, Than bow and worship at a monarch's call; An easy task to profligate the one, The subjects follow, and how soon undone!â He ended with his eye on Envy fix'd, Who, tossing high his snakes, in turn spoke next: âNever, by thy dread sceptre, shall it be, Columbia from a crown shall freedom see! I'd rather be the vulgar, born to kiss Our royal feet, when we the sign express; Yea, be of those, who oversee the damn'd; Or to the whirlwind ocean be condemn'd, Or swim with naked bosom through the lake; Or freeze eternal where the mountains break, Than that Columbia longer should possess The sweets of freedom without bitterness; Or be ingulf'dââ Brief was his voice, suppress'd By wrath that boil'd within his caldron breast. Speechless he sat, with madness overpower'd, While the cold adders on his heart devour'd. Now Cruelty arises, grim'd with blood, Slavery, in waiting, at his left hand stood; His gory eyeballs shoot a murderous glare, Contentious serpents twist about his hair; His mouth half open shows his pointed teeth; Rank putrefaction quickens from his breath; A scourge of uncoil'd snakes his right hand holds, His left the lacerated son of Africk folds: âLong have my thoughts been riveted on blood, And hard I've strove to make my promise good. I've left no arts unpractis'd, to debase Their haughty minds and bring them in disgrace. âBut that our plans the better may succeed, Albion I taught to make her children bleed, That she, without compunction, might apply My slaving scourge against their Liberty. âHence I contriv'd the manner of her laws, To give her subjects death for slightest cause: A beggar'd orphan for the refuse bread, By my instruction, strangles with the dead. On every heath, a gibbet dark is seen, Round which, at night, appear the ghosts of men. It fill'd my sightâit gave my heart its joy, On earth to find such enviable employ. âWith Albion's crown, a friendship firm I held, His peers and nobles; and their bosoms steel'd 'Gainst every act that Mercy could suggest, As though that hell their very blood possess'd, Or a coil'd viper drove it from their breast. Prompted by me, they seiz'd on Freedom's birth, And made their griefs a subject of their mirth; Held them to bondage on the ocean fast, Where oft with torture, they expired their last. Unsparing scourges with strong arm they plied, Yet still they curs'd, with strength unsatisfied, Though with their oozing blood the deck was dy'd! At each deep mark, the sufferers groan'd with pain, Which, to my ear, had musick in its strain. With hard-set teeth, their bleeding flesh they tore, Till their ribs, naked, glisten'd through the gore. Reduc'd by drops, their hearts at length gave way, They then their bodies loos'd, and cast them in the sea.â The fiend takes breath. With joy the monarch glows, And the court, leaning, an awakening shows To hear him all.âSoon rested, he renews The theme:ââWhere scourges answer'd not their views, They bound them close with manacles and chains, Where sad they pin'd with hunger-eating pains; In dungeons, barr'd the privilege of day, They sigh'd, and wept, and groan'd their griefs away. Bread, streak'd with green, and live with brooding worms, They ration'd them for foodâtheir only terms. This what they eat; if they refus'd, they felt An inward fire, that caus'd their flesh to melt. Yea, such the flame, it made their hearts to fry, Which soon reduc'd them to anatomy; Then, O what concert would delight my ear, Of dying groans, that agoniz'd the sphere! ââFree born am I. My birth, Columbia gave,â (Their only cry.) âWhy am I bound a slave?â They plead for water to allay their thirst, To draw forth pity, save from bosoms curs'd; They mock their drought; then drink Britannia gave, Of poisoning power to waste them to the grave. The sailor drank the draught, then gasp'd for breath, And soon his meagre form was seiz'd by death.â Here ceas'd the fiend. They shouted in applause, As though they'd strangled Freedom and her laws. Long was the period ere they staid for breath, Then yell'd so dire, they startled things beneath; Louder than thunder, when it awful breaks, Or earth's convulsion, when her centre shakes. At length, the monarch gave the signal nod, Commanding silence of the house of blood. His glaring eyes lost half their aspect wild, His brows thrown back, his features grimly smil'd: âHell swallows up the earth! 'twas nobly done! Only have We to finish what's begun. If Freedom tamely suffers this to pass, Swift run the sands of her expiring glass. Yea, on the ruins of her state, will We A throne erect sublime of monarchy. âMuch honour is to him, Our peer last spoke; His whips of wire their stubborn hearts have broke; He, to rewards, no titleship need urge, As many souls are his as he can scourge. âHow must it wring with agony Our foe, Fredonia, wretched, listening to their wo! We bend to dust the bosom of her pride; In lofty triumph o'er her land We ride! Her tears are drops of cordial to the soulâ Freedom is downâa Monarch rules the whole!â Listening no longer could his nobles sit, But, with one impulse, bounded on their feet, And peal'd their tongues, their sovereign to extol. So loud, the spectres started round the hall. The shouting done, he scans the future o'er: With less of ardour, his expressions pour: âYet wisdom dictates not to urge too far, Or, through despair, they might be drove to war. That's not Our purposeâbut to sink them down By small degrees, till they accept a crown. When once made infamous, they'll yield a prize Without resistance to the first that rise. âThen, must that enemy of Crowns retire From off the earth, and give Us Our desire; Yield Us that world, which, then, We whole shall claim, Fredonia may return from whence she came; Yea, let her visit heaven to cringe and fawn; Such servile worship is our utmost scorn. Without variety, how wearisome, Ever the time with anthems to consume! I'd rather mount the whirlwinds of the storm, Or ride the lightnings in their wildest form.â He spoke with triumph, yet he look'd distress'd, As though compunction rankled in his breast; But soon his bosom, festering with despair, Gave to his features an important air. After short tumult, Luxury arose, And thus his thought upon resistance shows: âKing of immortal hosts! no cause I see, That ever they will wage hostility: For, when Britannia to our purpose bent, To reach the west, we swam the element, âAt first, we doubted ever to succeed, So firm their fathers stood in patriot deed; But soon we found them willing to our sway, And thousands join'd us in a proud array. Spies gave us aid, the friends of rightful kings, To sound their views and bear them precious thingsâ Britannick gold to bribe the letter'd press, Which pour'd forth streams, made rank with bitterness; Forc'd them, their ocean laws to violate, Laws that press'd Albion with a crushing weight. No bars are now to interrupt our wayâ For us, their holy men devoutly pray! The great, the noble, wealthy and the wise, Bow to thy throne with reverential eyes. âThe east and north, of where the Hudson rolls, The ruling and the rul'd resign their souls; But, in our progress to the south and west, We met the herald with thy dread behest.â As midnight birds, when they behold their prey, Erect their heads and make their eyes look gay, So the court royals, with a smiling look, Ey'd the smooth courtier, as he boasting spoke. Avarice had now his former shape resum'd, And thus began, as if with vict'ry plum'd: âGlory of hell!âin this position restâ No thought of war will harbour in their breast. Yea, I myself the nation can o'erwhelm; None shall assist me from thy subject realm. Provide but ample means, I ask no more, And soon I'll bend them to thy royal power. Ingots of gold will all their Freedom buy, For that's their godâtheir potent deity!â When shrivell'd Avarice in silence fix'd, The frightful demon, Cowardice, spoke next: His shape was bloated, like the form of death, When swell'd to bursting with cadaverous breath. His voice was boisterous, though he hell would storm, Whilst every feature heighten'd the deform: âWhy talk of war? Its name their joints would shake! Mention the theme, their liver'd hearts would quake. They might, forsooth, a noisy nothing showâ To think the thought, would pale their colour low. Their strength is waterâI, myself, alone, Could bow their necks, and yoke them to a throne. A blow, well aim'd, would strike them into awe, Hence, why this dread, they'll proclamate a war? Petition and remonstrance, all they doâ To Albion's king upon their knee they sue; And what's their suit? That he, henceforth would deign To let them voyage, unplunder'd, on the main; And that, 'twould please his majesty, no more To let his Leopards prowl upon their shore. Also, that he in grace would condescend No more to slave the offspring of his friend! âWhat, talk of war with such a kneeling race? No fight is in them; spit upon their face, They'd call it accident, or, at the most, 'Twas British spittleâmake it out a boast! âBy that which gushes from this skull-laid floorâ By those that suck the marrow and the goreâ By shrieking millions that descend hell gate, Crush'd with the pressure of their sinful weightâ By sceptred namesââ Here broke his utterance short, Spent by the passion which his liver wrought. His eyeballs strain'd to bursting, show'd his wrathâ His chattering jaws were bath'd in bloody froth. The council felt an ague at his form, So like an image in a thunder storm. Lo, now the monarch fiend his mace wields round, Touch'd with strange fire!âImmediate, at a bound, The host arise;âtheir rising was a roar Equal to ocean breaking on the shore. Hush'd to attention, with expression loud, He pour'd his voice among the Stygian crowd: âSuch fury, vented, never will decide; It argues nothing but a heart of pride. When tempest passion bears away the mind, It makes Us feeble as weak mortal kind. âPartial, at first, We apprehended war, But this bears nothingânot the weight of air; They kneel, but never rise.âAdmit they doâ Would not the Albion trident pierce them through? Soon would their navy strangle in its graveâ No star-lit banner on the deep would wave. But should they struggle through a warring blast, Then till eternity would Freedom last; Hence, Our design is not too far to press, Or they, perchance, by arms might seek redress, Our purpose is to break their Union down, And then for Anarchy to place the crown! âLuxury, thy tongue so well hath spoke Our views, A riband's thine, the brightest thou shalt choose. Avarice, take gold, sufficient the demand; Accept this rose asbestine, from Our hand. A garter, Cruelty, to thee we give; Soon other Lords shall equal gifts receive. âGreat was Our cause to apprehend, indeed, That with Columbia, We should ne'er succeed. But now, 'tis plain, if We contrive it well, She bows in worship to the Powers of hell. âThe better hence Our plans to carry forth, From this, We'll brief adjourn and meet on earth. Far to the north, where Hampshire's mountains rise, Whose craggy summits shoot into the skies, We'll dart invisible,âfrom thence, behold The passing scenes, as, various, they unfold.â The court dissolv'd, while such the shout, it tore Th' impacted skulls, out-leaping from the floor; They swam upon the blood, gnashing their teeth, While Death, all hideous, started from beneath! Shrieking they fly, and pass through hell above, As fiends the cloud from off the lake remove. In twice nine days, they gain the mountain's height, And glad, with willing feet upon its summits light. CANTO III. HEAVEN. ARGUMENT. Invocation .... Description of the Celestial Regions .... The Convocation of the Immortals at the Bower of Heaven .... Their speeches still farther elucidate the causes of the War. The scene is laid in Heaven .... The time, one day. Long hath my Fancy, on the wing of death, Pursued her darksome way through hell beneath, Where, cramp'd with horror, breathless have I stood To mark the dismal scenes of pain and blood. But now, escap'd the regions of despair, I feel the spirit of the quickening air To bear me upward with elastick spring, Beyond the circle of the comet's wing. Thou, who sustain'st the poet as he climbs, And the rough passion of his soul sublimes; Giv'st him to walk through nature's boundless road To search the place of Deity's abodeâ Thou, Muse of Poesy! inspire me now; With light effulgent, circumfuse my brow; Direct my compass from this downward earth, To where the mind receiv'd its wonderous birth. Give me the touch that none but angels feelâ Elysian glories to my soul reveal! StrengthenâO guide me, in my course on high, And ope the gate of heaven, expansive to mine eye! What strange emotions startle through my soul! Beyond my sight, earth backward seems to roll! Before my gaze, th' inspiring Genius stands; She leads the way of heaven with holy hands! Her touch, divine, improves my visual rayâ I see, I feel, I breathe immortal day! Beyond the burning radiance of the sunâ Above, where stars in dancing circles run; Careering thence, where fire-wrapp'd angels sing, Touching the gold of the melodious string,â Distance immense, immeasurably high, Heaven's gate unfolds, where dwells the Deity! Scenes drawn with beauty's pencil fill the sight, Where shades, in nice gradation, touch the light, Soothing the soul with passion exquisite. Pure streams of nectar in abundance flow, Whose channels brilliant with the diamond glow. Perennial vallies open on the view, Where rich variety is ever new. In emerald robes the hills and lawns are dress'd, Sweets of elixirty th' affections feast. Flowers of choice odours decorate the scene, Like stars that sprinkle heaven with gold serene. Snow-drops, and daffodils, and lotus fair, Carnations, jonquils, crocus, tulips rareâ The lofty blooms, and those that love the ground, Pour their sweet breaths deliciously around. Th' ethereal soil, in which with smiles they grow, Refines their tints above what earth can know. The more the curious eye their structure views, They through the soul more loveliness infuse; Never they languish, but eternal live, Beyond what man of Beauty can conceive. On zephyr'd hills, exuberant groves extend, Down which the streams in glad meanderings bend: Here proudly waves the victor laurel round, With which the temples of the just are crown'd. Trees of rich blossom with new breathings rise, Spreading their flower-deck'd bosoms to the skies. The elm, majestick, rears its head on high, Near which, the slender aspen trembles by. Lambs in the vallies, innocent are seen, The honied flowerets cropping o'er the green; A part, beside the lions, prone in sleep, Graze without fear,âothers, in gambols leapâ Pleas'd, wake the lions, and enjoy the play, Crouch in the grass, then, rampant, start away. The brindled tiger placid treads the lawn, Or, in his humour, dandles with the fawn. The kid's wild frolick swells the various bliss; Young Life and Beauty in embraces kiss. In this fair paradise, where pleasure reigns, Birds of sweet love enchant their happy strainsâ The shrill-tongued lark, exulting as he flies, With early song salutes the opening skies. The gold canary never checks his notesâ Smooth through the air his breath melodious floats. The speaking mocking-birds their hymns recite, And the sweet sparrow twitters with delight. The linnet, thrush, and nightingale, in turn, Make the wide heavens with glowing musick burn. At times, one, lonely, sings his mirthful song, The others listening to his warbling tongueâ When, lo! an impulse striking on the whole, Their strains, seraphick, melody the soul. A lake expands its bosom on the right, Pure in transparency as heaven-wash'd light. Nothing, to match its beauties, can compare; The touch, creative, stamp'd perfection there. Swans, in their milk-white robes, adorn its breast, Whose silver shades beneath their bosoms rest. With gladness now they row along the lake; Their moving shadows into fragments break. The happy swimmers mark the pearls that shine, And diamond shores, that burn with flame divine; The firmament, reflected from below, With all the wonderous scenes that round about it glow. Here souls, translated, wash their stains away, When, from the earth, they burst their prisoning clay. With holy thirsting, large they quaff the wave; Youth springs, immortal, from the virtuous grave! Refin'dâenfranchis'd from the dross of earth, In sacred form, they pour their homage forth. Clad in the vestures of their God, they stand With hallow'd censers burning in their hand, From which, pure clouds of incense curl on high, To visit which, live rainbows leave the sky, Whilst the bless'd multitudes, on bended knee, In holy thought, adore the Deity. Deep pouring from the lake, a river springs, In whose bright waters angels dip their wings. The liquid silver winds through field and groveâ 'Tween parted hills, where Beauty wakens Love. Its marble bottom, deck'd with emerald, glows, As smooth the lapsing wave, like falling musick, flows. Its sloping banks with dewy moss are crown'd, Such as draws life from heaven's nectareous ground; Soft as the web, that forms the silkworm's nest, Or down, that blossoms on the cygnet's breast. Each colour kissing each, with sweetness blends, Like heaven's arch'd bow, that round creation bends. Beyond the moss, stand trees forever green, Where the choice bird of paradise is seen. The fruits, reflected in the wave below, Seem to the eye invertedly to grow. Myriads of gold and silver fishes play 'Neath the cool shades, or in the dazzling ray. With nimble fin, they rapid dart along, At times, like tiny troops, a beauteous throng, Marshall'd they move, and then in files they reach; Then, shoal together round the diamond beach. They leap and taste the airâthen, diving, swim,â And then, quick-wheeling, o'er the surface skim, Rippling the unchaf'd waters as they pass, Shivering the streamâa broken flood of glass; Birds, trees and fruits, the heavens around that glow, Like shatter'd fragments in the mirror flow. On these bless'd fields, translated Spirits move, Wrapp'd in th' adoring ecstacy of love; Here reign immeasurable joys forever more, Immense,âfrom sea to sea, from shore to shore. High o'er this blissful heaven, another rolls, Where seraphs walk sublime the shining poles; Or float on rapture, circumfus'd in light, Bordering the Deityâstupendous height! Respiring large His breathings exquisite. At times, they ride on chariots, wing'd with flame, Through fields of spaceâcreation's boundless frame! At times, in holy rings, their hands unite, And virtues pure to Deity recite. Then, in conclusion, swell the strain so high, The anthem echoes through immensity. Beyond this second heaven, the seraphs' clime, Another rolls in viewless light sublime; Here dwells th' eternal Deity, unknownâ A unit, multitude, and yet, alone! The centre pointâthe circle of the whole; The former of a mite,âthe breather of the soul! His outward skirts are curtain'd in a blaze Of gold, made fire,âblinding the worship gaze Of angels, crown'd with tires, unless they fling, Before the sudden brilliancy, their wing, Shading the dazzling dark; e'en then, the shine Bows them with reverence to the Power divine! So bright th' effulgence of th' empyreal beam, A world of suns would midnight darkness seem. Thus orb'd in fire, He zones creation round, Breathing to all vitality profound. When in Elysium west, He shades His view, He lines the vault with stars, created new, And round the universe, their paths pursue; And bands of angels on the wings of light, Repeat soft musick to the ear of Night. Now, from the orient, Deity appears; Forth, at His smile, day quickens round the spheres. The dread magnificence, to his presence given, Bends into worship all the host of heaven. The open-bosom'd flowers, baptiz'd with dew, Breathe a rich wilderness of odours new, Which forth allures the humming-bird with bliss Them to salute with love-delighting kiss. A cloud of gorgeous fashion in the east Supports an angel troop, of whom the least Not the whole earth would bear comparison, Were all its beauty melted into one. The cloud, the paintings of a God unfold, With which the topaz, ruby, fire-prov'd gold, The opal, jacinth, emerald, jasper fair, Are meanly dull, their splendours to compare. Fringes of rainbow'd light its skirts adorn, Blending the beams of Deity new-born. Soft as it floats upon the silver air, Unimageable forms divine appear, Changing exquisite, as the cloud in heaven Changes its folds, by breathing zephyrs driven. These cloud-wrapp'd angels of the second clime, At the dread voice of Deity sublime, Convene th' Immmortals at the floral bower, When great events hang pending on the hour. Lo, now a Seraph from the cloud descries Fredonia, entering the empyreal skiesâ (Fredonia, crown'd celestial at her birth, The guardian genius of Columbia's earth.) On vital pinions, swift, he cleaves his way; His cheek so fair, it shames the blush of day. His plumes, transparent, in the sunbeams shine, Reflecting far a splendidness divine. As smooth he, floating o'er th' empyrean, sails, Fanning with gentle wing the yielding gales, A golden clarion in his right he bears, Which, when it sounds, his purposes declares. Soft to his kissing lips the trump he plies, And, breathing melody, as forth he flies, Touches the soul with nameless ecstacies: âYe, crown'd with immortality! arise! Fredonia, from the earth, hath reach'd the skies. Lo, at the foot of heaven's superior mount, Where flows the stream from the Elysian fount, Pensive she sits. Arise, Empyreals, now, Greet her with smiles, for heavy is her brow. Events, momentous, weigh upon the hour; In full escort, attend her to the bower. There will the Goddess openly relate The weal and wo of Freedom's infant state.â Brief as he clos'd, he breath'd such melting strains, It echo'd musick through the happy plains. Forth at the summons, th' Immortals move With grace, that shows their origin above. From different seats of blessedness, they rise With dazzling virtues speaking from their eyes. From lawns profuse of flowers, where Pleasure dwells; From mossy banks; from grottos; echoing dells; From groves of myrrh, where musing Silence strays, And Contemplation all herself surveys; From the full river, diamond-bounded lake, Where souls, enfranchis'd, hear the anthems break. Their numbers brilliant, moving at the sound, Would the strain'd efforts of the mind confound; As countless stars in brightening circles dance To hallow'd musick on the blue expanse; As drops of dew the robes of spring adorn, When infant day with fragrant breath is born; As beams of light reflected from a shower, When three fair rainbows from two mountains tower:â In numbers like to this, the Bless'd appear, And fill with splendour the celestial sphere. Ravish'd in bliss, so light of foot they tread, They leave the dew upon the violet's head. West of the lake, in this bright world divine, A mount appears, down which gold streamlets shine. A plain extends upon its summit round, Where Grace and Beauty step the hallow'd ground. Here breathes the bower of heaven with fragrance full, From which the souls elect, ambrosial flowerets cull. Palm trees in negligence of nature stand, Forming the pillars that enclose the land. The spiry-creeping vines their brown trunks wed, Whose purple clusters gladdening odours shed. To fill the distant vacancies between, Growths, less exalted, careless intervene: The nectar peach, the olive and the fig, Round which the woodbine winds its modest sprig. At times, the orange spreads its silver leaves, Through which, with truant curl, the jesmine weaves. The spice-tree flourishes divinely fair, Scattering a waste of richness through the air. The rose-vine throws a beauty o'er the scene, Its flowers expanding 'mid the foliage green. Down from the lofty palms, in loose array, Festoons depend, where bees their pastime play; And humming birds, too delicate to light, Sip the aroma, lovely to the sight. Four cedars to the north affect the skies, Two rainbow arches from their summits rise, Caus'd by the incense breathing from each flower, 'Neath which th' Immortals enter in the bower. The grove within, reveals soft scenery bright: Through quivering leaves, descends the dancing light: A verdant carpet round the floor is spread, On which th' Empyreals, without foot-print, tread, Compos'd of tender turf, with flowers bestrown, Scatter'd with wildness by the hand unknown: A various charm to every sense is given, Presenting beauty to the eye of heaven. Seats, gold with diamond edg'd around, are plac'd, And in the centre with a forum grac'd. On Thirteen pillars it majestick stands, The choicest labour of celestial hands, Of purer gems than mortal eye beheld, While more than half their splendours lie conceal'd: The fair cornelian shines with roseate dye, With which the colours of the topaz vie. A tender green is to the beryl given, The sapphire dazzles like the noonday heaven. The crystal, clear, emits an unstain'd light, And next in order is the chrysolite. The amethyst with modest violet glows, Through which the amber of the jacinth flows. The virgin ruby blushes in its face; Rob'd is the emerald with a spring-time grace. The sardine's beauty melts upon the sight; The polish'd marble varies with delight. Quenchless, the diamond burns with brilliant ray, Vital, reflecting the eternal day. Plac'd on these pillars is the forum seen, Fashion'd of gold and precious gems serene. Silver the steps, reflecting, as they rise, A light, resplendent to celestial eyes; Pearl is the floor, smooth as a crystal sea, Where heaven is pictur'd in its symmetry. Full on its front, by Beauty is engrav'd An Eagle, lightning-ey'd, with pinions wav'd. His dexter claw the sacred Olives hold; His left, the pointed Arrows strong infold. Sceptres and crowns lie broke, his feet beneath, While toys Scarfs, Ribands, &amp;c. of monarchs blaze before his breath. A galaxy of Stars illumes his head, Whose beams, divergent, dazzle as they spread. Now, on the plains, whence towers the sacred hill, Where, from a fountain, leaps a cascade rill, The host celestial, congregating meet, With looks that show their happiness complete; Smiles play in ringlets, dimpling round their cheek; Eyes glancing, rapture of the soul bespeak. In radiant files display'd, sublime they move, Leaving the plain to reach the mountain grove. Fredonia, soft array'd in robes divine, Leads with smooth step the consecrated line; Her snowy right sustains a cap and spear, The verdant olives in her left appear. On as she glides with a perfective grace, Love's roseate blushes paradise her face. Next, Independence, dignified moves forth, His fashion vigorous, though of heaven his birth. His full-arch'd bosom, partial is reveal'd; He bears a feather'd arrow, bow and shield. Justice progresses with unchanging mien, Sedate, majestick, yet not unserene. His hand sustains a sword of diamond pure, His righteous judgments, like its edge, endure. With angel look, sweet Temperance leaves the plain; Delight and Health are smiling in her train. Their step so light, they scarce the flowerets press, Their eyes receiving and returning bliss. Industry, blushing like the rising morn, Supports a harvest hook and golden corn; Sweet-ey'd Contentment in her hand she leads, As gay she trips it o'er the laughing meads. Then Patriotism, mark'd with port sublime And step unwavering, treads th' Elysian clime. A garland wreath his lofty temples bear; His eye looks future with a pondering air; All self is rooted from each inward part, A beam of honour burns upon his heart. The goddess Victory bears high a shield, Flashing a dazzling brilliance o'er the field. She moves, direct, where Patriotism shows; A star-crown'd PhÅnix stands upon her brows. With gentle Love, soft Charity combines, Around whose neck a smiling cherub twines. The sweetest odours to her breath are given; Her heart is tender as the thoughts of heaven. With musick-measur'd feet, moves gentle Peace, Without whose presence, heaven would lose its grace. Robes, wrought by Deity, her limbs infold, Whilst round her temples curl bright rainbows fring'd with gold. Next soul-delighting Hope is buoyant seen On playful tiptoe, dancing o'er the green. Flowers bloom full-bosom'd, where she prints her tread, While pictur'd visions glitter round her head. Other Immortals in bright train appear, Before is notic'd their declining rear. But now, when these had pass'd, the souls glide forth, Who bless'd mankind what time they dwelt on earth; Wash'd in the purifying streams above, Half veil'd in radiance, to the bower they move. First of this circle, Washington appears, Whose august virtue the full heaven reveres. Couchant, the lion stoops with humbled eye; An eagle greets him from sublimity. With golden clarions, seraphim proclaim: âBehold a mortal of immortal name!â Montgomery next approaching, gains the sight, Serenely mild as evening's holy light. A train of stars his temples proud adorn, Pure as creation at her birthday morn. Warren deep blushes with the glow of youth; His heart beat vital in the cause of truth; Wrapp'd with the beams new burnish'd in the sky, His bosom feels a throbbing ecstacy. With kindred likeness of an angel's mien, The next advancing is th' immortal Green; The laurels, growth of heaven, his brows surround; His eyes flash victory with look profound. Knox, Lincoln, Sumpter, Marion, Clinton, Wayne, Reid, Otis, Laurens, mingle in the train; Sevier and Mercer, Woosterânames of lightâ Nash, Morgan, Putnam, dignify the sight. Franklin appears with wisdom in his form, Whose arm had tam'd the lightning of the storm; E'en Virtue's self receives a brighter shine From the dread presence of the man divine. Hancock and Adams next engage the view, Clad with the righteousness of virtue new. By their proud deeds a tyrant throne was riven, For which they triumph on the plains of heaven. These patriots having pass'd, th' illustrious Jay Glides without effort o'er the flowery way. While in the prisonment of flesh he dwelt, He the sharp tooth of rancorous Faction felt; But now he walks in radiant glory forth, Spotless his robes, expressive of his worth. Next Henry, lone is seenâpillar of light, He broke the darkness of tyrannick night. His voice spoke thunder to an iron throne, And made the holy cause of Freedom known. A halo, burning round his brow, appears; His tongue sublime gave answer to the spheres. Nor shall the Muse forget thy memory, Ames! Thy voice was richer than a poet's dreams! The flint in marble hearts was soft as snow, When the sweet honey from thy lips did flow. Thy name brings back the years forever gone, When Friendship bless'd me with thine elder son; When round our brows Hope pour'd her gladdening ray, And golden pleasures stole the hours away; Thy name with his shall dwell upon my heart, Till death shall strike my bosom with his dart. And now, behold two sons of epick song Are heard to sing with transport on their tongue: Barlow's soft numbers flow with smooth delightâ Him, sweetly answering, swells harmonious Dwight. When poet's lightning burnt within their breast, They felt a feeling never yet express'd, They rode the thunder-clouds, when black with war, Or held sweet converse with each social star. The comets visited, in fiery robesâ Worlds above worlds,ârevolving globes on globes; Their eyes, impatient, glanc'd the sphere of heavenâ But now, fruition to their souls is given. Next West appears, the child of nature true, Under whose touch the living features grew. Why from thy country, foreign didst thou roam? Was not thy genius sanctified at home? Forbear the theme: from earth, enfranchis'd now, Thy pencils, dipp'd in heaven, designs immortal show. West is succeeded in the train by Rush, Whose cheek, made youthful, glows with starry blush. On earth, deep wisdom stamp'd his every plan, Unspotted virtue sanctified the man. In him, the widow and the orphan found A husband, father, for their anguish'd wound. His country's glory was the polar beam, That cheer'd his soul on life's tempestuous stream. He met Disease and foil'd him of his dart, Despair and anguish quit the struggling heart; Death trembled at his comingâwithering, fled; The dying rose, and bless'd his hoary head; But now he basks beneath the beams of love, Freed, through death's portal, to the courts above. The eagle soul of Rittenhouse appears, Whose winkless eye observ'd the flaming spheres. Live at his touch, a universe sprang forth; He gave celestial worlds a second birth. Godfrey and Fulton, wedded hand in hand With eye of science, ken the wonderous land; That, with his quadrant, had revers'd the sun, And taught the mariner his course to run; This, with his vapour dens'd, propell'd the ship, In proud defiance of the storm-chaf'd deep. Columbus next majestick treads the lawn, Whose noble breast three infant ships adorn; A burning star illuminates his brow With rays resplendentâthirty points and two. O how ungrateful to purloin thy fame, And give thy glory to another's name! Lo, for a world, the earth but dungeons gave! But heaven is justârewards beyond the grave. Others, innumerous, pass upon their rear; Fine arts and science in their looks appear. Bath'd in the streams of life, no mortal mind Can reach their souls, with sacredness refin'dâ Conceive perfection, pure as hallow'd lightâ Think of thrill'd ecstacy beyond delightâ Wind the soul's fancy, till it feels a press, An holy shivering with its happiness; Beyond impassion'd thought, their raptures tower, As earth is distant from the Centre Power! But who is this initiated now? Wisdom and eloquence adorn his brow! A brilliant halo round his temple plays, He seems bewilder'd in a tranceful mazeâ 'Tis Pinckney smiling over Death!âwhose tongue Mortals transported, with their hearts new-strung. Th' empyreal train, with measur'd step proceed, Winding the mountain where the flower bees feed. Through paths, with manna sprinkled smooth, they rise, Each bosom touch'd with holy sympathies; Myrtles, profuse, their odours breathe aroundâ Th' eternal amaranth delights the ground. Roses unfold their bosoms to the day, And all their sweets without a thorn display. On every side, infantile cherubs move, Whose rosy features smile the smile of love; Their dove-like rings exuberant charms unfold, Dipp'd in the rainbow,âedg'd with melted gold. Some, harps, self-tun'd,âsome, timbrels bear in hand, Whose notes of symphony the soul command. Light as their fingers kiss the trembling strings, Each voice an anthem voluntary singsâ So passing sweet the musick floats around, The flowers, new with life, lean forward to the sound. At length, they enter in the bowery grove, Fill'd with the fragrancy of heaven above. To golden seats in circles, they repair,â Freedom's celestial Genius with an air Ascends the forum, that reveals her breast With some concernment heavily depress'd. Justice, in signal, elevates his handâ The musick dies of the infantile band; Their wings expanding, wave with motion light, Reflecting beauties, that surprise the sight; Their blushing feet, on palms and olives rest, While love's soft breathings nestle in their breast. The musick hush'd,âFredonia rises now, A wreath of graces curling round her brow. Transparent colours in her cheeks uniteâ The tender rose, the lily's virgin white. With voice attun'd to a delicious note, Sweet through the bower her words harmonious float: âYe, heaven-translated of the world, above, Feasting unsated on ambrosial love! Mine eyes are swimming in a tide of bliss To greet you here from scenes of bitterness. âFor twice ten summers from these bowers I've stray'd, And the full earth through all its parts survey'd; Yea, mark'd its passion with a jealous eye, Tracing the progress of its Liberty. âAlas, no State of the terrestrial sphere Would the invitings of my language hear. Round Africk's shores a slaving ignorance reigns, And Superstition crimsons Asia's plains. Europia's offspring make the specious show, As if they knew the blessings I bestow; But all their knowledge is a sounding name, They groan alike, with kings and crowns the same. Distinction forms the worship of their soulsâ 'Tis this their mental energies controls. What now their hopes the highest satisfies Is tinsel wealth and things of butterflies. âI for a time, brief-passing, struck my lyre, On the green borders of the Seine and Loire, The Franks transported with the glorious theme, Sung swelling anthems o'er each happy stream; But soon grim Anarchy appear'd, and fill'd The heart with bitterness, till the soul was chill'd. Son met his father, reckless of his years; The rivers burst their banks with blood and tears! With aching bosom from the land I flew, Unable to behold the bleeding view. âFrom this dread scene I pass'd to Erin's plain, But round her shores I tun'd her Harp in vain. The notes, at first, were soothing to her heart, And ne'er,âO never did I think to part. But lo! a prowling Lion check'd the strain! I left her tearful, stooping o'er the main.â Her bosom trembledâshe let fall a tearâ More lucid drop than thatâ(the morning clear,) Which hangs suspended from a leaf's extreme, A beauteous mirror for the orient beam. The cherubs fill the pause with melting songâ The weeping numbers sighing, they prolong; Their voice uniting with their harps, so faint, And yet so tender the soul-moving plaint, Th' immortal synod languish, while they feel A something holy, that no words reveal. The anthem clos'd, the subject she pursues, Her blue eyes floating in the trembling dews: âFrom the Green Isle, my circle I renew'd: The sweet-ey'd star of evening I pursued; I met Columbia, and with transport soon I thrill'd her heart with Freedom's quickening tune. Lo, at the mention of the sacred name, The sainted patriots felt a hallow'd flame Glow in their bosoms, and, with impulse strong, They pour'd their tear-wrapp'd feelings from their tongue: âHail to the name!âColumbia, ever be Cemented, and abide in Liberty!â The voice of heaven proceeds: âEach object thrill'd My heart with gladness, as my course I held. Whatever compass, anxious, I pursu'd, Through cities throng'd, or vales of solitude, All felt their Freedom purchas'd was with blood. The temple which to me you there uprear'd, Was still exalted, honour'd, and rever'd. Peace o'er the land her milk-white doves display'd; No jars intestine shook their faith, dismay'd; Joys circled joys on buoyant tiptoe round, The vallies bloom'd with life by Plenty crown'd. Each soul breath'd valourâgenerous every heartâ Substantial virtues strengthen'd every part. Their voices shrill re-echo'd to my lyre, Which in their bosoms wak'd a quenchless fire. âBut language cannot speak what sad I fear'd, When forth from hell two hideous fiends appear'd, Avarice! fell Luxury!âFrom Albion's Isle, They brought the bane, Columbia to defile. âNow wings of gaudy insects charm their sightâ Musick of gold is transport exquisite. Th' invading poison circulates aroundâ No real virtue consecrates the ground. Soon I perceiv'd my lyre a discord madeâ I cut the path of heaven with deep affliction sad. âFame, I instructed to abide on earth, To bear us tidings of Columbian birth. Unseen she stood within the hall of state, To hear the manner of their full debate.â She pauses with her tearsâher bosom heaves With deep concernment, while the synod grieves. In her soft breast, such passions habit there, Her tongue refuses farther to declare; She waves to Independence on the right, That he should rise, the painful theme recite; (He from the earth had late advanc'd his way, To join th' Immortals in their bright array.) âAnd must I, sad, the circumstance unfoldâ The icy truthâColumbia kneels to gold! The tyrant Fiend employs his every hour To bow her sons beneath a kingly power; To bar Fredonia from the land away, And rule the earth, unbounded in his sway. No method, art, device, will be untried, That on their necks victorious he may ride. Discord, loud-raving, thunders round her shores; At every stride, his voice augmenting roars; To break their Union's chain, th' Infernal's planâ To grasp Columbia in his withering span. âThe hardy virtues of their sires have fledâ They yield the liberty, for which they bled; Tamely they suffer Albion to excite The savage wild men to their murderous riteâ To send forth spies to watch their weaker part, And thus stab Freedom, secret, at the heartâ To bar their traversing the ocean free, Unless to her, they price the liberty! To smite their vessels, ere they reach the sea, And bend their Eagle from his realms of dayâ T' Impress their bosom'd offspring in their fleets, Where hope expires and mercy sad retreatsâ To starve, to scourgeââ His utterance was suppress'd By scenes of blood that labour'd in his breast. A softening drop is seen in every eye, Touch'd to the soul with tender sympathy, Such tears as to immortal eyes are givenâ Pure as the droppings from a rainbow'd heaven. In holy sorrow Washington aroseâ And thus the fullness of his bosom flows: âFrequent my heart hath been oppress'd with fears, That, for my country, I should shed these tears; For, ere my soul took farewell of the earth, I saw these monsters through the land stride forth. Avarice, at times, uprear'd his feverish head, And sliding Luxury, from the ocean fed. âWhen late I fill'd the Presidential seat, Britannia strove to bind us with her fleet; Our Eagle, free, upon the seas debas'dâ A stain, indelibleâour name disgrac'd; Yea, seiz'd and tore our mariners from homeâ Their slavery fix'dâirremed'able doom! âColumbia wept the bitter tears of wo, In friendship's mask to find a bitter foe. Rous'd by injustice, I address'd her throne, And, firm in purpose, made the grievance known. With seeming truth, in promise, she compliedâ Yet I but partial on her faith relied. Where interest leads, her promises are vain; Revenge and malice in her councils reign. âBut O, reveal,âis Freedom's virtue gone? Is every sense of right and honour done? Are all the worthies, whom I left behind, Bent on the knee? to infamy consign'd? Alas! the theme!âOf Jefferson, O sayâ And hath his virtue gone the slippery way? Pickering, Monroe, and worthy Madison, Within whose veins a bold resistance run? Floyd, Gerry, Sullivan, and Stark, and King, Who ever to thy name did incense bring? Scott, Carroll, Shelby, Macon, Eustis, Strong, That shouted Liberty in choral song? âAnd O, inform me of that virtuous Frank, Who scorn'd his royal birth and join'd the rank With those for Freedom toilingâLa Fayetteâ Who oft in battle made his sword-blade wet With blood of tyrannyâwhose soul stood high, To give to man his boon of Liberty.â He sat. Fredonia with sweet breath began, While melting passion through her features ran: âSon of my bosom,âmatchless heir of heaven! The songs of angels to thy worth are given! How would my soul rejoice, could I relate, That all stood lofty, as of ancient date. But by the arts and cunning wiles of hell, Against their country many sad rebelâ Wither'd their laurels, blotted out their fame, Pleading for Albion in her cruel claim! âTheir names I'll mention not, 'twould wound your ear, To learn how lost their former character.â A murmuring deep of indignation rose To hear that numbers, treacherous, should oppose Celestial Libertyâplead tyrant laws, And heap disgrace upon the nation's cause. But soon she gave them peace: âWhat though this loss? A host stand purified from slaving dross: âGerry, a pillar of the state, remains, And Sullivan his dignity sustains. The veteran Stark gives honour to the truth, Defends the glory he'd acquir'd in youth. Never will Shelby, Eustis, be forgot, Nor Macon, sage in years, nor dauntless Scott. Monroe, ingrafted with his country's name, Maintains her cause unshaken and the same. âGreat Jefferson demands of heaven its praise, I've bound his temples with the civick bays! He rul'd the nation with a sage-like skill, When faction's voice was heard from every hill. Around his brows will clustering honours twine, Till, full of years, he gains this world divine. âThe ancient Carroll and the hoary Floyd, Who were thy colleagues when thy arms destroy'd The claims of crimson tyrants of the east, And Independence shouted in the west, Stand in uprightness, as in former day, And grow in virtue as their heads grow grey. And ah, what bosom ever can forget To name the hallow'd virtues of Fayette? A star of promise, he in youth appear'd, Whose holy light the breast of sages cheer'dâ In age, a pillar of a cloud by day To guide the pilgrim wanderers on their way, Searching the mountain grove where Freedom dwells, To wave her standard on a thousand hills! âThe bane of tyrants, he exalted lives, While, from each patriot, reverence he receives, Pure as from worshippers of prophets old, Who the dread purpose of their God foretold! âNow is the nation sway'd with justice mild, By Madison, Columbia's honour'd child. His fame, unsullied, ever will abide, While spotless worth shall character decide. âAn host of others I could mention now, Whose upright knee will ne'er to Luxury bowâ Who from oppression ever will be free, Or die the martyrs of their Liberty!â Thrill'd with her voice, the cherub struck the lyre, The souls, translated, kindled with the fire; They sung: âColumbia! let thy name be free, Or die the martyr of thy Liberty!â The chorus ended, Franklin, rising, speaks, Celestial wisdom mantling in his cheeks: âFreedom's Divinity!ânone shall despoil Thy temple; but their deeds will back recoil, And hurl them down in deep obscurity; Or, only thought of to their infamy. Yet, 'tis most grievous to behold the band, Let loose from hell to desolate the land; Still, still a galaxy of names appear, Whose steel-bound joints will never stoop to fear. In these I rest my hopesâthey'll hold the cause Of right and justice, liberty and laws. The subject never from their minds will fade, Till haughty Britain is repentant made. They've borne her cruel tyrannies too longâ With sword unsheath'd should they redress the wrong. Yet shall the Eagle in her strength arise, And swell her pinions in remotest skies; Beneath her wing the Lion lap the dust; Justice will speak, and speak the cause is just.â His language touch'd the soul's ecstatick chordâ Their every eye was brightened at each word. Now Justice gave his thoughts: âYes, I decree, Their cause is just, and Albion bends the knee! âLong hath thy breast with anxious cares been riven, Clouded, then brighten'd, then to darkness given. Some pain thou'st suffer'd, such as heaven can feel, To mark thy children their destruction seal. Thy tender heart felt pressure on the earth To see the agency of hell stride forth. With iron rule they bear a tyrant sway, And, like a flood, sweep virtue far away. âBut the glad promises that Franklin spoke, Nothingâno particle, shall e'er be broke; No, never shall thy sons, Fredonia, bow To civil Discord, or Britannia's brow. Fix'd is my wordâunalter'd my decreeâ Victorious shall Columbia bound the sea; And, after various struggles on the land, No hostile footstep shall imprint the sand. âYea, Jeffersonâhow precious is his name! My tongue delights to dwell upon the theme! The elder Adams also has my care; He stood for Freedom with his bosom bare. His mind is as the star that gilds the northâ Unchang'd its brilliance since its day of birth. âLo, I this honour to their worth decree, That they, upon the nation's Jubilee, Shall be translated from the mortal sphere T' embrace their Washington and Franklin here.â A song of triumph pour'd from ev'ry tongue; With loud hosannas, the empyrean rungâ Great was the joyâit overflow'd their breast, That Freedom's Jubilee should make them bless'd. Justice proceeds: âFame enters soon the bower, To bear the word that humbles Albion's power. âYet such is man, clogg'd in the vale below, He first must feel, before he'll virtue know; In vain that Washington with tears impress'd His farewell blessing on his country's breast, In which he urg'd them to avoid the fiend, Who, in a borrow'd guise assum'd the friend; The factions, ever, ever to abjure; By every mean, their Union to secure; Nor let the different stars of east or west, Or north, or south, disturb the nation's rest; To fly from jealousyâvindictive hate, Which soon would strangle Freedom in the state; To watch with eagle eye ambitious minds, Whom oath nor league of sacred friendship binds; And thus become a nation rul'd by law, And not by men; nor change with every flaw. âBut from his parting voice they've turn'd aside, Yea, with a scoff his maxims they deride! Hence they, these truths to know, must sharply feel Arrows acute,âavenging, biting steel; Refin'd, at length, by deep affliction taught, They'll rise to virtue and redeem their faultâ Live till the trump shall echo from the sky, To wake the sleepers from mortality! âList to the sound, that breaks upon the ear! 'Tis Fame ascendingâLo! she's present here!â Scarce ceas'd the clarion of approaching Fame, When the bright Goddess, like celestial flame, Enter'd the bower!âTh' Immortals lean, profound, To catch her accents as they echo round: âRejoice, ye bless'd inhabitants of heaven! Behold, sublimity from earth is given! Scarce from his ball hath time uncoil'd a thread, Since I the temple of the nation fled. âThy offspring, longer than the present hour, Could suffer not the grasp of Albion's power; But war have they with righteousness declar'd, The Independence of their name to guard! âThis was the labour of a fearless band, In proud defiance of the civil brand, Flaming the nation round:âLoundes, Johnson, Giles; Macon, the sage,âthe first in honour's files. Varnum and Holmes, and Crawford and Calhoun, And Adams, rising to meridian noonâ Grundy,âBarbour,âVirginia's pride; and Clay Spoke to the heart and bore the palm away. âA band of heroes to the north advance; Entering Detroit, their silken banners dance. The men of ocean their proud ships prepare To meet the spoiler with defiance there. âColumbia, bounding in her flaming car, From shore to shore proclaims th' avenging war. Her eye on heaven is bent to aid her cause, To bind the States in One, and vindicate her laws.â Fame ended thus: and thus th' empyreal band: âColumbia, hail!âThy Liberty shall stand! Thou sunderest the links of Luxury's chain; 'Tis thine to curb the pirate of the main. Ere that thy sword shall in its scabbard rest, Deep to the life it wounds Britannia's breast. Columbia, hail! let Union be thy star, And it shall guide to victory in war.â When ceas'd the anthem, Henry stately roseâ His language ardent from his bosom flows: âMy soul is deified beyond her sphere By the glad sound, that broke upon mine ear. Now shall Columbia, without period, be The seat of science and of Liberty. Ye heaven-wash'd souls, that beautify these bowers, Are not your hearts refresh'd like sprinkled flowers? Not vainly have you pour'd your lives on earthâ Your sons now testify their patriot birth. âAs Justice righteous utter'd at the close, So, without succour, let them meet their foes; By which they'll learn, how once their fathers fought; How dear the price, that they their Freedom bought. Knowing its cost, they'll prize the gem more high, And guard the blessing, as divinity. âAs fiends, unseen, are bent to crush them down, And make them slaving subjects of a crown, Hence, heaven should only for a time be hid, Till they experience what their fathers did; Or, like a ring of adamant, they join Solid in One, and cramp the foe's design; Then thou, Fredonia, should'st from this depart, And, with thy virtues, animate their heartâ Drive back grim Discord, howling, from the soil, And all the darkness on the Fiend recoil. âTill then, no succour from thine arm be given, But jealous mark them from the wall of heaven.â He paus'd. None rising, Justice took the vote; The whole assented with a vocal note. At sound of musick, th' Empyreals rise; Stars, new created, brightening o'er the skies. In happy troops, they swim on buoyancy, Singing the song of night, seraphickly. CANTO IV. SURRENDER OF DETROIT. ARGUMENT. The commencing of Hostilities .... Invasion of Canada at Sandwich .... Council of Officers .... The Infernals on the White Mountains .... Hull falls back to Detroit .... Vanhorn attacked by Indians .... Battle at Magagaw, or Brown's Town .... The landing of Brock .... The Surrender. The scene is principally laid at Detroit and at Sandwich ....The time is sixteen days. From heaven, where seraphim their anthems chant, Sweet, as divine, with voices jubilant, The Muse descends to dwell with earthly things, Where griefs, and tears, and feuds, and harrowings, Perish the heartâwhere hostile armies meet In dubious strife; on ocean, fleet with fleet. And now, mad War, with sanguine brow comes forth To wrap in blood and fire the suffering earth; His voice terrifick swells, discordant, loud, Like far-off thunder muttering from a cloud. The monster, Death, is seen upon his rear, With Hunger, brandishing a crimson spear; Fierce through the land he drives his smoking car, With nostril wide to snuff the spoils of War. Now, ere the convocated States proclaim'd The strife of arms, as late in heaven was nam'd, To war, forejudg'd was by the President, And, at Detroit, to Hull a message sent, That he should stand in readiness to lead The army north, and do the signal deed; To enter Malden; sudden strike the blow, And bring the Lion at his feet to bow. In the proud field, where Washington was first, Hull had made bright his battle steel of rust; And oft the President from fame had heard The various darings of his youthful sword; Hence sprang the reason in the statesman's breast, To give him to perform the high behest. While thus the war was brooding to explode, The Albion monarch in a royal mode Instructed Brock,âTecumseh in his train, Rank'd with the valiant on the martial plain,â T' advance to Sandwich,âwall it with defence, To keep th' invasion of Columbians hence. The smooth Detroit the threatening shores divides, Like gentle Peace, where Uproar fierce abides. Columbia's standard from the south waves forth, The royal banner, proudly from the north. Now when the sun from Cancer's fiery height Shot through the azure heavens his arrowy light, Another herald at the fortress Fort Detroit. found Hull, with the bravest of the brave around, Ohio's patriot sons:âMacArthur, Cass, To live while Time shall hold life's mortal glass. Miller a monument in battle stood, Where Spencer, Davis, pour'd their hearts' rich blood. Tippecanoe. These were the firstâbut others hasten'd near To learn the tidings of the messenger: âFrom Freedom's Hall, swift as a swallow's flight, I've wing'd my way, their doings to recite; War, for the wrongs of Britain, they've declar'dâ The slaving tyrant of the ocean, dar'd! âThe order comes from Madison, the wise, To pass Detroitâstrike Sandwich by surpriseâ Thence, forth to Malden rapidly proceed, And there proclaim that Canada is freed.â The herald ended. Instant, at the word, Hull touch'd his hand upon his sleeping swordâ The sleeper waken'd with a sudden flash, The air receiving many a scarless gash. But lo, the others in deep silence stood, Their clouding brows proclaim'd their rising mood. Hull, brief his charger mountedâthis express'd To his battalionsâfloated every breast: âWarriors! the time invites us to our armsâ The hoarse-ton'd clarion sounds its wild alarms! Great is my joy to mark your souls prepar'd, Back to return the Albions their reward. Need I their cruelties, their crimes recite To cause your hearts to quicken for the fight? Where can we bend our eyes on shore, or flood, And not behold our brothers in their bloodâ Or by their allies' shrieking murderous peals, Or on the deep, where none soft mercy feels? These wrongs must cause the veins of life to boil, Now shall swift vengeance on their heads recoil! âCompanions, brac'd in arms!âthe hour has comeâ The wish'd-for hour that Britain finds her doom. The time is pregnant with portentous castâ Yield must the foe, or Liberty is past! âWhen young, I drove this Lion from his prey; Like joy I feel, though now these locks are gray, To lead my children in their glory forth, With Freedom Stars to lighten up the North! Each soul, I mark, impatient to unite To raise our Eagle to her native height. âThis chain of bulwarksâthe defence of Brock, We, with the globes of battering guns, must shock; Then crowd the barges, bend upon the oar, And land and form in columns on the shore, And conquer Sandwichâin its bosom camp, Ere drowns in ocean heaven's empyreal lamp.â The column took the order and display'd, And every part, with rapidness obey'dâ Charg'd deep the entrails of the cannon dark, Then touch'd them into life with quickening spark. The driven balls leap madded from the flame, Bearing impetuous ruin o'er the stream. Live shells, careering from the mortars, fly, Which, in explosion, waste the enemy: As when a cloud comes scowling from the west, With heaven's artillery pouring from its breast; Chambers of hail their frozen stores expend; The small hills tremble; trees with groans descend; A whirlwind pestilence involves the sphere; Grim spectres, clad in thunder robes, appear; The herds in panick to their covert hie; A shuddering wildness glaring from their eye: So, like the sudden bursting of the storm, The bellowing brass the elements deform,â So, like the herds, the Britons shun the blast, Flying the bulwarks with their souls aghast. And now the patriots to the beach repair, To pass the stream and meet the hostiles there. The barges fill'd, by Hull the word is givenâ The oars dip nimble through the waters driven. The beaks, sharp bent, divide the yielding waves, While round their curving sides, the white foam laves. Effulgent shine the burnish'd arms of war, And nodding plumes, and streamers, loose in air. By application rapid of the oar, A moment finds them at the adverse shore. The first MacArthur is to land:âthe sound The drums proclaimâhis warriours, at a bound, Stand on the beach. Cass next unfreights his bark, Whose heart is honour, and his soul a spark Of fire Promethean; he moves with pride, His angry falchion glittering by his side. Miller, a rock unshaken in the fight, Marshals his squadrons like a cloud in night. Vanhorn and Snelling crowd upon the shore; Solid in files on Sandwich black they pour; Brock and his Albions desolated fly, To mark the Eagle darkening up the sky. Now while the sun was hovering o'er the deep, His gold beams slumbering on the mountains steep, From Hull this declaration issued forth To rouse to arms the friends of Freedom north: Swift as the wind, it circulated far, And, for a time, gave vigour to the war. âCanadians! listen to the words we bear! Sole against Britain, we the fight declare. Peace, honour, friendship, from our standards waveâ We tender Liberty to him that's brave. You, we solicit to retire from arms, Where uproar ravages with dire alarms. Wed not the savage powersâremain at homeâ Plough the fat earth, and labour at the loom. âBut if ye languish Freedom to inspire, Come join our banner, floating in its fire! Yea, liberty is yoursâher equal lawsâ Bear but our Eagles in the righteous cause. To tyrants, longer, never bend the kneeâ Come break the shackles, and like men be free! âLet none distrust our faith: We pledge our word To sweep the country with a conquering sword. See Brock retires before the van of power! Fast magnifies our strength at every hour. With death's grim look we'll blight the name of Crown; Opposing armies die beneath our frown! âAlbions, beware!âjoin not the savage horde, Or death, unsparing, sharps our every sword. A Briton, listed by a savage side, Will of indulgent mercy be deniedâ Avenging wrath his impious heart shall feelâ His blood shall gush smoke upon the steel. âNever from this my purpose I recedeâ A savage ally shall with savage bleed!â The northern patriots listen'd to the callâ For Freedom's sake, they yielded up their allâ Their fair-ones, mothers, children, and their wives, The cherubs of the soul, for which man lives; Yea, plac'd their life, their liberty in Hull, Believing never he'd his faith annul. Bas'd on this thought, their swelling hearts beat high To break the chains of regal slavery. At day, succeeding, Cass made bare his swordâ A band of heroes with his views concurr'd To drive the foe, yet lingering at a bridge On Malden pathâand war excursive wage. Carneal, Kentucky's son, in ambush lies, With rifles prim'd, to aid the bold emprise. Cass fords the stream in secrecy below, And, like deep waters, steals upon the foe. Sudden he waves his banner on their rear; Carneal beholds, and burns the atmosphere. Cass, at the volley ,with a breath exclaims: âRush to the battle! wake the sleeping flames!â Mad dash the warriours in their dread arrayâ The Albions break, like folding mists, away. Cass hot pursues them, like a blazing star, Till night descends and checks the flying war. Now through the paths sublime that circle heaven, The car-borne sun is round th' empyrean driven. His steeds, caparison'd in gold, tread high The starry pavement of the vaulted sky. Instinctive spirit quickens in their soul To reach the summitâthe meridian goal. Large from their nostrils, breathes a light divine, Before whose presence stars forget to shineâ Reverent they bow before the god of day, Careering onward in his boundless way. During twelve circles, Hull inactive stands, While Brock in silence congregates his bands. Cold at his heart, in apathy he lies, Reckless to lose eternityâthe prize! Distant, at first, slight murmurs met his ear:â But soon the passions openly appear. Thus while, at midnight, clouds in anger form A wall of darkness, brewing for a storm, A stream of lightning, glancing on the plain, Astounds the ox and fires the sheafy grain: Smother'd for breath, it smoulders, deep conceal'dâ But soon acquiring air, it breaks, reveal'd Wild to the heavens; the peasant hears the blast, And wakes disorder'd with his soul aghast: So had the army kept their murmurings pent, But now, like smother'd flames, they found their vent. Hull strove to quell the rising of their rage; Various his arts their burnings to assuage. But nothing longer would the Patriots hear His flighty shiftings, prompted by his fear. Not oath-seal'd promises would now suffice To quench the anger kindled in their eyes: So, in the west, a spot stains ether's blue, At first scarce seen discernible to view, But slow-attracted vapours swell its form, And soon it threatens to descend in storm. Hull mark'd the gathering cloud with soul dismay, And call'd a council to advise at day: âHaste to the leaders of the army brave;â (This brief instruction to his aid he gave,) âAnd, in the centre, bid them to convene, Where all my views, unlock'd, shall fair be seen.â His aid the order pass'd.âThe chiefs repair To his pavilion with impatient air: MacArthur, Cass, take seat upon the rightâ Miller the left, in burnish'd armour bright. Snelling and Baker join the martial train, With effort hard, smothering their bosoms' pain. Next Peters, Larabee, in youthful bloomâ MacCollock, Wistler, lock'd in silent gloom. Ulry and Blostler, of the valiant bornâ Carneal, and Gilcrease, and the bold Vanhorn. Hull, while the council in foreboding sate, With honied accents open'd the debate: âCompatriots, born to liberty, and friends! I know that blood of purity distends Your hearts to check the stride of tyrannies, And give to future years your memories. âWhat courage can, that well can ye achieve, And to your country a protection give. But void of means, how soon must courage fail, And all its efforts in submission quail! âOf late, what sad intelligence of war Cold petrified the heart from Mackinaw! Not Hank's valour could the fort maintain, When savage madmen rush'd along the plain. Chicago next is murder'd by their bands; Our brothers next will fall by cruel hands! No courage can resist superior power; Death and defeat assail us every hour! âHow Brock accumulates a besom train To sweep us hence with fiery hurricane! Perhaps, whilst here our purpose we debate, Detroit surrenders to relentless fate! âWhat though that Meigs, with patriotick toil, Sends us the fatness of Ohio's soil; What though battalions from her plains advance, A scathing lightning on the foe to glance; Yet, wall'd around with steel on every hand, Scarce hope remains to reach our native land!â Indignant passion flash'd from every eye, Like meteors shooting from a lowery sky. MacArthur, gloomy in his wrath, aroseâ But calm at first, his elocution flows: âSad doth our general mourn for Mackinawâ But did he notice give to Hanks, of war? No: the first signal was a shower of ball, That caus'd the Eagle in the dust to fall! By same neglect, my soul foreboding fears, By this, Chicago swims in blood and tears! âWhence comes the thought, that energy is vain To quell the lawless pirate of the main? Is courage no avail?âshall we despair, Because that Indians yell, and tyrants stare? Do they not break bewildered with dismay, When the star banners on their sight display? Do they not gasp beneath our reeking steel Beyond the plastick power of art to heal? Do not our burning deaths with vengeance fly, Like lightnings, pregnant with mortality? And shall we yieldârenounce the glorious prizeâ Retreat with shame before the nation's eyes? Neverâno, neverâgird our falchions on, And strike the prowlers of the forest down! âTrue, if we spend our efforts in debate, We shall be conquer'd by vindictive fate. Yea, Brock is rising, spreading the alarmsâ But where are we? asleep upon our arms! The powers eternal ever have decreed, That man must act, as well as will the deed. Will war, in proclamations, frighten boys? Without the strength of thunder, they are toys. The foe beholds us with contemptuous pride, That we do naught but threaten, rail, deride. âRise, warriours! rise!âas once your fathers did, And build to fame a lasting pyramid. Advance on Malden with the steel in hand, And scatter death's disaster through the land.â As when the sickly south, with tainted breath, In dog-star season breathes the air of deathâ With sallow look, man languishes away, His mind, despairing, feels itself decayâ Behold, from western hills sweet zephyrs rise, And drive the poison to pestiferous skiesâ He feels new life from the inspiring gale, And leaps light-hearted with his sinews hale: So Hull's deep death-song damp'd the soul for strife, And so MacArthur touch'd it into life. Cass next arose impatient from his seat, And as he spoke, he kindled with his heat: âMy soul is with my brother on the rightâ MacArthur's language thrill'd me with delight. âWho, with misgivings, weighs our means as small? Have we not death-dust to inflame the ball? And fattening nourishment? and, every hour, Heroes approaching to augment our power? âThe general thinks we have but courage here, But I should joy were no pale cowards near. Who talks of strangling at the Lion's feet, Unable to effect a safe retreat? Retreat!âhow chill, how icy is that word, Ere scarce a gout of blood hath dimm'd a sword! Do not our squadrons burn to meet the foe, And cause, at once, his royalty to bow? And shall we pause, inglorious, dastard pauseâ Blacken our honourâblast the nation's causeâ Wait till their ardour into coldness falls, Ere we advance them to o'erleap the walls? No: never shall it be! while all is fire, Storm and their energy with flame inspire. âWhat thing is that, whose soul is nothing braveâ A liver'd wretchâa base-born, cringing slave: Better by piecemeal to be torn apart, And let the blood gush hissing from the heart, Than branded infamous with coward's name, And damn'd forever to inglorious fame: No: rather labour in the field, and heat Our bodies, till they pour a sanguine sweatâ Yea, toil in smoke and fire, begrim'd with dust, And then with heaven th' impending victory trust.â Fill'd with his soul, unconscious from their seat, The warriours leaning stoodâpassion'd with heat. Their hands hard gripe their swords,âtheir eyeballs dart The living fire that vitaliz'd their heart. When seated, Miller rose: âYes, well I know, With ported bayonet we could down the foe. Yet my desire is cautiously to form, Before we lead the slaughter of the storm. Bruise, batter to the earth the girding walls, By shells exploding, and a weight of balls. With strength, unbroken, every part invest, And strive to bow their standard from its rest. Never a drop we'll sacrifice in vain, To plume the enemy with numbers slain. Full half the triumph of the field is lost, When that the foe of Freedom's blood can boast. âBut should we fail in this desired plan, Then, bare the sword and meet them man to man. In thick-set battle rank, assail their power, And dip our bayonets in a bath of gore. The soul of Brock will bend beneath the blowâ O'er death move smilingâfate upon our brow!â With heart o'erpower'd, the listening heroes sate, Lost in themselvesâimpassion'd with debate. Silent their voices,âbut with one accord, Assent was given by darting forth the sword. Of speech recovering, Miller they approveâ And wait impatient for the word to move. Hull, to redeem the honour of his name, Endeavour'd to imbibe a kindred flame; And thus, like valour, he: âStrong beats my life, To mark your bosoms, ready for the strife. What though I dangers did at first unfold, 'Twas merely done to test your courage bold. Now well I've prov'd what mettle ye are made, To hold a polish, till yon orb shall fade. âOn sailing batteries let the cannon glide Along the beachâthe waggons by their side Laden with war.âCass, regulate the firstâ The heavy wains, MacArthur, are thy trust. At morrow's dawn, we crush the Lion down, And tear off Canada from Albion's crown!â Swift at the word, the officers repair Each to his standard, glittering in the air. The troops the counsell'd purposes receive With joy that makes their stooping thoughts revive. With burning hands, part, on the waters, place The battering engines, Malden to deface,â Ladders, in readiness to mount the walls; Others, the waggons load with shells and balls. This done, they wait the tedious, lame delay Of lazy hours, that limp the time away. Now sable-vested night pervades the round Of earth and heavenâa stillness reigns, profound. Black rolling clouds blot out the starry host; At times, on murky wings, is seen a ghost, In dismal fashion of a moon-lit cloud, Pale as the glimmerings from eclipsing shroud. Hull, at the resting hour, to slumber went, His thoughts foreboding direful event, And, at each pulse-beat, grew the discontent. His coward soul affrighten'd sleep away; A cold-sweat horrour chill'd his breast to clay. At times he doz'd, while tossing to and fro In terrour, dreaming of the savage foe. His troubled fancy paints Tecumseh now, Approaching hideous, with a murderer's brow, Ready with lifted battle-axe in wrath, The brittle tenure of his life to scath. His hair stands bristled at the sight of death; A freezing ague breaks his chattering teeth. His eyes, distorted, cast a madman's glare; His heart shrinks up, though cracking with despair. Ghastful, he starts; awakens from his rest, A cold dew dripping from his smothering breast. At once, the phantom vanishes afar, But leaves the token of a mental scar. He heaves for breath.âAt length his tongue regains Its power of motion to describe its pains: âWhat coffin blackness characters the night! Are these shapes Indians passing on my sight? Hark! List! the yell! it strikes upon my earâ I'm lost,âundoneâthe enemy is here! Whereâwhither shall I fly?âwhat plan pursue? The axe, the stake!âto think it, strikes me through! Nothing will save!âI'm fetter'd fast to death!â I feel his touch!âhe sucks away my breath! âAnd can it be a dream? methinks I view The troops in waiting at the watch-fires blue! âAlas, what madness broke upon my mind, To leave Detroit with all its strength behind! And to the savage must I yield a prize, Who take delight in human sacrifice? Their cruel hands will rend these limbs apart, And stretch on scorching fire my quivering heart! How death will meet and melt us in the fight! A tragedy of blood! This favour'd night, I'll give the order to renounce the plain; Death reaps a harvest, if we here remain! âLet war-mad chieftains talk of courageâfameâ The spangled butterflies of tinsel name: Nothing but emptinessâmore vain than air, As childrens' sportings make an idiot stare. âBut I'll so manage, as the wealth to draw, By speaking eloquent in praise of war. My declaration sounds through every part; The nation thinks I'm iron at the heart. So long, designing, I can fraud them thus Of gold,âmy words believing, credulous; Fools may the honour, for I ask no more; But this lingering on this deathful shore!â While thus he pour'd his peculence of mind, He thought that nothing habited the wind, But scouts of hell were flickering to and fro To sink Columbia and exalt the foe. On wings of darkness they pursue their way, Watching like vultures to devour their preyâ Nor cavern, nook, or hill, escapes their sight, While the earth hangs suspended in the night:â But when the stars that lead the twilight gleam, With lips of coral, kiss the ocean stream, Pale they retireâput off their bodied formâ Pass into air, or ride upon the storm. Malice, the agent stationed in the north, Was near, and heard him vent his weakness forth. With thirsty ear he drank the fell discourse, Then to the mountain, in a whirlwind's force, Hied him away:âhe reach'd the craggy steep At midnight, while the fiends their councils keep. Late from the throne of hell, the court adjourn'd, That from the earth might Freedom be o'erturn'd. He sought the king, supreme above the rest, Thron'd on a rock, while thunders scarr'd his breast. Kneelingâthen rising in his place, he stands And thus salutes him with devotion hands: âAt thy command, to Erie's shore I went, And hover'd secret o'er the general's tent. I saw the colour from his features fly; A ghastly fear look'd haggard from his eye. Soft I approach'd, and heard him wild repeat, That, veil'd in night, his army should retreatâ That he no longer would his life expose To fire and faggots of the savage foes. If maniack chieftains met in dubious fray, He'd breathe the air till life should melt away. Should but a missile glance his thinking head, What service babbling Fame, deafâsilentâdead? Untouch'd by war should Canada remainâ No blood of wildmen should her fields distain. âI left him planning, how, by artful stealth, He might deceive the nation of its wealth,â Hence, Sire of Kings! if we but manage well, His name to Brock will he obsequious tell, And his whole army to conditions kneel.â When thus the agent had the tidings spoke, The Fiend began with consequential look: âWhen first Columbia blew the warring blast, Sad We foredoom'd Our every hope was cast. No thought had We, that ever she'd pretend To measure arms with Britain, and defend Her flag of stars: But now Our heart beats light, That We shall gain a kingdom by the fight! âThy every word gave joy. Should Hull but yield The first battalions usher'd to the field, Our native children, roaming through the wood, Would drown the nation in a sea of blood: Yea, should We now these recent arms dispel, And plunge the boaster through the jaws of hell, No doubt remains but Liberty is goneâ Columbia kneels, subjected to a throne! âBut think what numbers bend to Our control! This war will give Us the Republick whole! Discord, unchain'd, around New-Albion strides, And all the nation of its strength divides. There, Our designs are cloak'd from every eye, By management of sage Hypocrisy. âForth, Cowardice, appear!âexert your power To gain the army, ere the morning hour. Treason! arise!âon clouds, expand your wingâ Sweet in Hull's dream let golden musick ring. But should you find him on the stream, in flight, You'll be unseen, till morrow ends in night.â The furies presently his voice obeyâ On wings obscure, they bear themselves away, Like clouds of thunder rolling through the air, Red lightnings on their front, black darkness on their rear. Soon they a prospect of the army teach, And find them, broken, crowding to the beach. Their bosoms burn with gratifying heat, To see the tearful warriours on retreat. But as the Fiend had order'd,âin a cloud, Till morrow's midnight, they their features shroud. While this was passing on the mountain's height, Anxious the Patriots waited for the light, To move on Malden with the strength of fire, And make the Lion from the north retire. While thus in their impatienceâHull began, Which, like torpedo's touch, benumb'd from rear to van: âA madness keeps us!âvanish in retreat! Fly in your safety from a death defeat! The wild-men, thousands, swarm upon the ground! Hark! hear them rustling in the leaves around! Why stand ye pausing?âfly!âquick dip the oars!â With speed of lightning, quit the savage shores!â Not rock-pent earthquakes from the centre drivenâ Not solid thunder leaping out of heavenâ Not fiery spirits flashing through the night, The spring-time earth with pestilence to blight, Would paralyze the soul with more dismay, Than Hull's command to fly from Canada. When first emotions partial were allay'd, In every feature anger was display'd; Each eye, deep-fix'd, shot vengeance from the soul, Like heaven's red meteors shooting from the pole. At length, with anguish searching to the heart, Lock'd in dead silence, heavy they depart. The barges move reluctant through the wave, Groaning with sorrow, laden with the brave; The waters part with sympathy distress'd, To give them passage o'er their sighing breast. The low-sunk watch fires, fading through the night, Glimmer on Sandwich with a doubtful light. The sky-rais'd steeples catch a feeble gleam, And pale reflect it in the dark blue stream. On the dim view the Patriots fix their eye, Which sad reveals their speechless agony. Fill'd with despair, they turn their sight away, Bath'd into dimness with the soul's warm spray. With aching hearts, at length they reach the shore, While blood, in passion, sweats from every pore. Night fadesâand darkness to the west is driven; Mild in the east, awakes the eye of heaven; By small degrees, the arch expands its wayâ The colours brighten, and their gold display. When night's thick curtain rising, show'd the morn, Webster, in fleetness leaping like a fawn, From Raisin, gain'd the centre of the fort Where Hull was plac'd,âto whom he made report: âFrom Raisin's stream, I bound to you express, To bear such tidings as the warriours bless. Rich with Ohio's fatness, Brush is thereâ Who earnest bade me to your ear declare To send him strength to meet Cawataw's band, Oft by the spies seen lurking o'er the land.â When the fair messenger the tidings told, Hull bade Vanhorn to file twice fifty bold, And forth advance with Webster to direct The trackless wayâthe valu'd stores protect. The warriour heardâand anxious to behold A hostile banner, felt his powers unfold. The late retreating in the midnight hour Seem'd to be written in his heart no more. Vanhorn commandedâhis battalion wheel'd, Their every bosom for proud efforts steel'd. Cawataw and his band in ambush lay, At signal, mad to leap upon their prey; Vanhorn approachesâLo, the sign is given! The savage war-yells break aloud to heaven. Destruction, plum'd upon their brows, they bearâ Their eye-balls fierce a tiger vengeance glare. The death-leads fly upon the wings of fireâ Matted in blood, Columbians gasp, expire. Here Gilcrease, Ulry, find an early graveâ MacCollock, Blostler, bleed among the brave. Soft as their spirits ebb to dusky death, They lisp their country with their latest breath; At every word they seem to tread the spheresâ Their fading eyes suffused in holy tears: âO Thou, who stay'd the chariot of the sun, When Israel fought on plains of Askalon! Now, Thy dread arm for Liberty make bareâ O let not Discord bring her to despair. Let Union weld the soul! Defend the just! We die to live! in Deity we trust!â They sunk in death. Their spirits enter heavenâ An introduction to the bless'd is given. But sad in bloody robes their bodies lay, Slow mouldering back to elemental clay: Thus four tall poplars on the mountains rise, With arms extended to embrace the skiesâ Towering sublime, their green heads waving move, Kiss'd with the zephyrs from the courts above: Behold, a smiting thunder tears them down, Ere nature's poet sings of their renown; Their green leaves fade, their trunks are rent in twainâ Their broken boughs lie scatter'd o'er the plain: So in their ruins lie the valiant dead, The first who glorious for their country bled. While these were dying, the Columbians strove To force the savageâgain a sheltering grove; But, hemm'd on every side, they strove in vain, Broken in parts, disorder'd on the plain. At length Vanhorn, wielding his brand, exclaims: âStand in a cube! return the melting flames! Cast off the shrinking flesh! blaze out the soul! Scorn, scorn the earth! in heaven your names enrol!â They quicken from despair, though heaven sublime Had call'd their spirits from the wreck of Time. In phalanx lock'd, immoveable they stand, Lighting a flame that kindles up the land. Yet, for a time, Cawataw girds the braveâ They charge, cut through, nor small the foe they grave. Firm they recede;âwhile oft with aim, they turn Short on the heel and cause death's fire to burn. They gain the fortâgash'd deep with many a wound, Their crimson life-drops dripping on the ground. The gory sight speaks bleeding to the heart, And every Patriot wishes for a part. Miller, at once, in all his arms arose, To take due vengeance on the savage foes. Warriours, five hundred, valiant from their birth, In panoply severe, the chief leads forth. Three, under Boyd, had fought with courage true, Though night involv'd them at the Tipp'canoe. Two hundred others with their souls as flame, To give to future years a deathless name. A scout of fifty, fix'd in soul to rise, Snelling commands to shield against surprise. Miller pursues him, proximate, behind, In sallied formâcollected in his mind. Brock, in the meantime, had despatch'd a host, To guard Cawataw on the Freedom coast. Silent they landed at the village, Brown,â Tecumseh rul'd,âa savage of renown, Five hundred of his clanâas many more Muir led, of Britons, confident of power. These at Magagaw, in concealment lie, Grim'd with dark brows, and horrid panoply. Thus they in ambush levell'd for the prey, While Snelling with his spies pursu'd his wayâ Wary he struck the herders of the wood, Expecting soon to start the savage brood. Scarce had he gain'd the centre of the path, When, lo, the wild men, rising in their wrath, Rush'd with stain'd visages,âthe work of hell, And scream'd out âDeath!â as with infernal spell! But Snelling's band immoveable remain, And deal to many a foe death's cramping pain. Miller, progressing with reserve behind, Heard the dire pealings, borne on wings of wind, A martial blush deep crimson'd in his cheeksâ He halts to listen:âand the line bespeaks: âThe enemy is met! Hark! veterans, proveâ Let the blood burn! Let all your valour move, And place your names in heaven; reveal the fire, That each inherits from his godlike sire; Yea, I behold it kindling in your eye; Rush, rush the battle! Victory, or die!â Mad dash the warriours at the given word, Death waits attendant on the Freedom sword. The Albions soon in broken ranks retire From bayonets dripping blood and muskets vaulting fire. But nothing thus, Tecumseh is subdu'd; Raising his speech, he holds his native wood. The Britons rally at command of Muir, What time Tecumseh, like a rock secure, Stands with full breast against the whizzing wrath, Glancing from Miller in a burning path. His mighty voice reverberating round, Causes the fighting tumult to abound. Now peals on peals with strength redoubling roar; The dark brown earth is glued with clotted gore. Clouds of convolving smoke obscure the skyâ Steel rings, fires blaze, trees fall, blood streams, and warriours die. As when two anger'd clouds meet in mid heaven, By fierce tornados each on other drivenâ The forky lightnings flash, dissolving round, Whilst thunders rock the universe profound; The mad clouds thicken with a hideous scowl; Th' affrighted spirits of the whirlwind howl. Unsparing ruins through the welkin fly; Earth's centre jars: loud breaks the vaulted sky: Scarce with less rage, the rous'd-up battle roarsâ In equal balance the contending powers. At length the allies from the field retire, And Miller strikes them with pursuing fire. At times, they halt, and bend a frowning eyeâ As oft the blue steel forces them to fly: Thus mastiffs furiously a bear assail With tearing teeth, to make her courage quailâ But when the lancing of her tusks they feel, Their fierceness stoopsâthey turn upon the heelâ They fly, they stand, as inward madness burnsâ Surly they fight, and back retreat, by turns: Like these, the bands of royalty recede; At times resisting, till they fainting bleed. Miller, at length, compels them to the shore, Where swift for Malden they apply the oar. The foe upon the lakeâMiller returnsâ Gathers the dead, and in the dust inurns Their gory bodies. Webster he descries With crimson'd bosom, mixt with enemies, Tossing with dying throes: He turns him from the sight, For the young warriour was his soul's delight. Slow as the passing traveller moves by, He drops a tear with a reverted eye. His footsteps tender o'er the valley tread, Lest they disturb the slumberings of the dead. Lilies, white-bosom'd, on their grave arise, Odours, delicious, wafting to the skies. By the rich incense, rising from the tomb, Vital they flourish with unfading bloom. This holy office done, Miller withdraws Back to Detroit, and gains the heart's applause. With throbbing breasts, the Patriots hear them come, By the far-sounding of the distant drum. Sons, sires, and maidens issue from the town, Thronging in crowds to greet the victors on. Those scatter flowers, these shouting high, proclaim Miller illustrious on the roll of fame. Now, as recedes the evening of the day, The western colours placid melt to grey. Wide o'er the world, Night spreads his mantle roundâ The young stars glitter in their orbs profound. Hesper in beauty throws her beams afar, First to appear Columbia's chosen star. Her sisters next with brilliant steppings dance In bright cotillions on the blue expanse. Blithe as they frolick in the dewy even, With gems profuse they deck the round of heaven. Behind the mountain pines, the moon in mist, Silent and slow, emerges from the east. Her face half-smother'd, shines with coral rays, Which seem the woods to lighten in a blaze: But soon she overclimbs the craggy height, And broad in heaven unfolds her peerless light. The stars in glittering troops around her play, Scattering their diamonds o'er her silvery way. The weary warriours on their couches sleep, Save the still out-guards, that the watch-word keep. With dire disturbance working in his skull, On tender down, half dreams the traitor Hull. Behold the fiends, which had in hell their birth, A murky cloud upon their wings roll forth, Which wraps the bosom of the earth in night; The moon and stars shrink backward with their light. Now Treason his coadjutor Cowardice. address'd, Broaching the subject of their late behest: âOur time is now, in solid darkness drear, To bribe with gold or terrify with fear. This to effect, must we our forms conceal, And nothing of our origin reveal.â Forth they their shapes reduced, and cautious crept By guard, who never on the night-watch slept. Close to the dreamer's head they hover'd near, In couchant posture to alarm his ear. First, Treason, whispering on his right, began, Which like still poison through his system ran: âHull, to my voice give heed! of things 'twill speak, To cause thy heart a musick throb to strike! âO what, terrestrial, can compare with gold! Earth, yea, an entrance into heaven is sold! Its lustre turns the rainbow into night! Ethereal gems are darkness in its sight! Its key, high-noted, how it thrills delight! âWhat! pause for character? 'tis all a plan To bind and shackle independent man! What! toil for glory, honour, and acclaim Of murderous battle call'd the field of fame? 'Tis for thy peculencyâempty noise, Men to make beggars,âlight as rattling toys. Does not the priest for lucre bribe his God To spare the sinner from avenging rod? Behold the recompense of Virtue!âsee, Are not her votaries garb'd in poverty? Yea, like the guilty, die a hideous death, Or, in damp dungeons, gasp away their breath! Did not great Cato mount the funeral pyre, And virtuous Emmett on the tree expire? Did not a Hampden, Russell, Sydney, Moor, Bestain the tyrant scaffold with their gore? âAdmit that nonsense honour is the prize, Will not the treasure make the boon arise? Is not vain glory, as mean barter, sold For the bright dust of all-subduing gold? âSee Genius starving for the means of bread, Without a resting place to lay his head! Behold the veteran, shivering in the blast, Despis'd, neglected for his actions past! His scatter'd grey hairs whistle in the windâ Trusting to fame, he pines in want behind! âNot so, where lustre of the gold is shed; It swells the heart, and elevates the head; Gilds each marr'd feature with a polish'd grace, And smoothes the wrinkles in a maiden face. âGold gives the man a noble privilege; Each word he speaks is wit of keenest edge. He may hold converse with the fiends beneath, And none will dare to stain him with their breath. Crimes he may practise of the deepest dye, And still his name, as bright as jewelry, Will current passâyea, held in high repute, And meet, from every hand, the fair salute. âFame, easy thus acquir'd, you'll not despise, Because no savage threatens in disguise! âBut let the vulgar poor commit a flaw, Of gold depriv'd, to buy the frowning law, Behold how Justice slays them with his sword, With scarce the sufferance of a farewell word!â Here the fell agent shook his membrane wings, Rattling a sound like treasure, when it rings; Hull smil'd to mark the visionary gold, And spread his hand to grasp it in his fold. The fiend proceeds: âHad you but riches now, What honours, flourishing, would deck your brow! Honours, untarnish'd, without blot or shade, Secur'd by diadems that never fade! This fortress but resign to Albion's power, And bounteous wealth will rain a golden shower. Such a mad multitude not care to ruleâ They now upbraid thee with their ridicule. Bear not their brows stern-arch'd, but cramp them down, And take revenge, by yielding to the Crown. âYou to the nation's ear can make excuse, And draw its treasure for your private use, Stating the want of power the walls to guard Against a foe with ev'ry means prepar'd, And forests, swarming with the savage fell, At signal ready to begin the yell! âThere's none of tongue so eloquent as you, These words remember, to yourself be true.â This having said, his teeth he chatter'd loud, That in his mind the sure belief might crowd, That wealth was falling like a harvest round, And golden sparkles cloth'd the tented ground. Up starts the traitor with a maniack glare, Like a wild ghost that travels midnight air. In restless dream, he gathers on the floor, Piling in heaps th' imaginary ore. Wearied at length, with gold unbounded blest, He sinks with smiling on his couch to rest. Now Cowardice approach'd his feverish head, And half in tears this moving sorrow said: âAlas, what bosom that has heart, can bear War's bloody note?âthe echo of despair! Who, that has sentiment, but sad must moan To hear the hollow sound of death's last groan? Thy generous mind to softer scenes is givenâ Thou art reluctant to this bloodshed driven. âLook at Chicago!âhow the warm blood streams! Listen! the hell-note of the savage screams! See the fond mother on the cold ground press'd, Her bleeding infant gasping on her breast! See Wells and Warner struggling in their gore!â Heath, with sharp anguish lancing every pore, Beholds the bosom of his wife in pain, Pouring her heart's sweet fountain on the plain!â Here, the cold thought his very heart benumbs; The fiend, more pressing, to his purpose comes: âSad yearns my breast, that vain should you pretend 'Gainst Brock this crazy bulwark to defend! From bosoms pierc'd will stream, a gushing flood; This fort will he a slaughter-house of blood! Thou nothing canst avail,âthy flag must down, Made wet with gore, in bondage to the Crown! âThink of the northern hive, which round you swarm, Black in their horrour to begin the storm, Wyandots, Winnabagos, Knistenooseâ Pottawatamies, Hurons, Kickapooseâ Algonquins, smear'd with murderâblood their tracks! And with them join'd the massacreing Sacks! These, these by thousands, lie in groups conceal'd, To sieze your throats and cause your lives to yield! âAnd think you to escape their lifted arm, When they like sudden floods shall burst th' alarm? Alas! how brittle is your hold on life, When, like loos'd hell, they blacken in the strife! âO learn in happy time to shun your fateâ The hour approaches when you'll learn too late! Shunâfly these cannibalsâwhose ancient plan Is first to massacre the leading man! Surrender,âstrike,âthese rotten walls forsake, Ere that they sieze and bind you to the stake! The time admits no pausingâno delayâ Cass and MacArthur you can send away. âLo! what dark forms are these, half viewless, seen? The visages of ghosts, or savage men! In dismal swarms, they move upon the sightâ They come, they pour impetuous to the fight!â The fiends with shrieking vanish'd in the cloud; Hull strove, cold-sweating, to exclaim aloud; But this had he not freedom to effectâ The ghastly vision held his utterance check'd, Save of his lips, which, in their movement, show'd Like dying men, when muttering of their shroud: âSave! rescue me from flames! I give up allâ Yea, every warriour,âtreasures, guns and ballâ MacArthur, Cass, and Brush, and Michiganâ Burn, burn the standard!âevery name unman!â At length, his mind grew gentle by degrees, Like ocean, when the winds have left the seas. A healthy moisture o'er his body crept, And calm his fancy till the morning slept. Soon the soft breathing of the morn springs forth, And breaks the cloud, that settled from the north. The star of beauty greets the watch-guard's eye, Leading the twilight, dancing up the sky. Instant the glimmer of the day was free, The early drummers beat the reviellÃ©â The rattling musick rung o'er hill and plain, And babbling echo told it back again. Sleep-stars alarm'dâon dewy pinions fliesâ The rous'd-up warriours from their slumberings rise. In burnish'd armour, in due files, they stand, To practise battle to defend the land. MacArthur, Miller, Cass, on chargers bound, The troops in motion as they give the sound. And now, with martial pomp, in line they dress,â Eyes, like the new morn, beamingâshoulders press. And now to column they advance in file. The fifes shrill whistling with the drums the while. Proud, as the motion of the tune they beat, It seems enchantment frolicks in their feet. As a thick brake in winter, silver'd bright With glittering ice, their arms reflect the light. The column now, at signal word, displaysâ And forth, they seem as in a dancing maze. Now they retreatâfire streaming as they goâ Now turn and charge th' imaginary foe. When Hull awoke, he search'd, with timid eye, If that, in ambush, savages were nigh. No danger lurking in his view, alone, He thus began in a despairing tone: âAnd is Chicago lost?âAlas, the day! O that remote were I from this away! And must it be, that I must yield this post? These trophies, Guns captured in the Revolution. which the blood of patriots cost? What course?âwhat method?âWild-men every where! What ails my heart?âit trembles with despair! âIt must be so.âI must this warfare end. Death fastens on my life, if I contend! âFor what fell purpose do these dreamers come, If not to warn me of impending doom? Methought the savage dash'd me in the lake, While part assay'd with fire my life to take! The flame I never felt, in mercy's careâ But O I suffer'd all that flesh could bear! All is not rightâand ah, that dismal yell! It froze my blood,âMy feelings who can tell! âNot shadows are my fearsâno coward slaveâ Have I not fought in battle with the brave? Fate, fate, unalterable commands me now.â Why should I struggle to avoid the blow? My struggling would be vain: Devouring death Would gormandize the whole upon the heath. âAnd have I not large prospect of reward, If I to Brock should render up my sword? Arnold, his flag but willing to resign, Was made, as though he own'd Potosi's mine: Now should I yield these ample regions round, My future days with riches would be crown'dâ As in my dream, a golden shower would rainâ But now, alas, what numbers must be slain! âYes, in my sleep, methought an Albion stoodâ His shape was odd, but what he said was good. It seem'd, wings, bat-like, from his shoulders grew, Rich o'er the tent the dust of gold he threw; A type, hereafter, what his king would give, When Brock my sword submissive should receive. âNot oft my mind is bent to follow dreams,â But in this vision, truth unclouded seems. For once, I feel inclin'd to trust the shade,â I'll pause no longerâBrock commands my blade. âWhat waste of blood shall I, by yielding, save! My censuring army rescue from the grave! âDeath is an awful thing!âhow pale, how dire! O let my soul on easy down expire! Alas, these wars!âwhat makes the nations fight? My heart! it breaks! my smothering breast feels tight! And will there nothing minister to good? Nothing but flying from this scene of blood! But Cass, MacArthur, instant must retireâ Their looks might awe and dampen my desire. Miller I dreadâVanhorn,âto mar my plan; But these, should I dismiss, they might my motives scan.â His views perfected, straight he left his tent, To seek the warriours, on his treason bent. He found them marshall'd in their armour strong, And thus deceptive spoke his ready tongue: âThe troops display'd with veterans would compare, But Cass, MacArthur, forth must you repair To strengthen Brush, and bring from Raisin's shores, Defiance of the foe, the valued stores. 'Twill be convenient to secure them here, Though at the present we've no want to fear. âHundreds, twice three, detachâtrue flint and fireâ To cause the lurking savage to expire. But yet I doubt an enemy will dare, Since Miller fought them, to oppose you there. âThink not, brave men, that ever I shall stain The breast of Liberty and give her pain. Let war aboundâhere in my strength, I'll stand, Fix'd in resolve to grave the kingly band. This, the ThermopylÃ¦, where Brock will find, That my retreat was fatally design'd. My heart feels young to conquer or to die, As when I battled with Montgomery. That banner, lightened with effulgent Stars, Shall ne'er be clouded in the glorious causeâ But pure its gems shall shine, more dazzling bright, Should royal legionsâsavages, unite To quench their beams of fire!âThen thou shalt find, That death will snatch their body from the mind! Though I from Sandwich thought retreating best, Here will I stand, till thunder strikes my breast! Ere that I yield, the blood shall fly my veinsâ My body, roll'd in dust, lie matted on the plains!â He spoke, like truth.âMacArthur, Cass, obey; Detach the number, and advance away. But as they pass'd the flag, a something deep, Struck to the heart, which made their eyes to weep. Cass paus'd in doubt, and half unsheath'd his sword To bid defiance to the general's word. MacArthur rein'd his passion: âO be calmâ And hear the language of a friend, that's warm. Scarce have our angry bosoms cool'd their heat, Caus'd by the dastard order to retreatâ Hence, prudent it becomes us here to pause Before we rise superior to the laws. Though at this hour, it might our honour saveâ A future day, it might the army grave. 'Twould be hereafter cited as excuse For discontent to riot in abuse, And lead to anarchy, defeat, disgrace; The lofty freedom of the land debase. Hence, though a jealous honour pains our breast, 'Tis wisdom now to answer his behest, Miller is there, and Snelling, and Vanhorn, Than whom none braver of the earth were born. Should he incline to let the Eagle fall, His shrinking soul their presence would appal.â Cass heard his reasoning with a silent tongueâ Return'd his sword, and led his files along. Slow they the borders of the lake-shore wind, With dark forebodings labouring in their mind. At length, a lumbering they at distance hear, Like thunders heard from clouds beneath the sphere. They haltâthey listen to th' alarming sound, With every feeling touch'd with the profound. The chiefs decide immediate to return, And what the nature of the war to learn. The troops receiv'd the order with a glow, That made the crimson of their cheeks to show. The backward path they measur'd with a spring, As though their feet were lighten'd with a wing. Ere long, with panting breath, they gain'd a height, Which brought th' investment of the fort in sight. They mark'd the Eagle riding on the breeze, Which gave their hearts a luxury of easeâ They shoutedâpour'd alongânor felt they toil'd, Though every blood-vein with their efforts boil'd. Lo, as they rush'd the entrance of the fort, Ready to spend their lives for its support, The Eagle flutter'd from her perch on high, Pierc'd with the shaft of blighting infamy! Now when that Brock had character'd his foe, He laid his plans to strike the star-flag low. He sent expresses in their ardour forth, To call his scatter'd people from the north: By this, an army he collected soon, To make Columbia with dishonour swoon; And, in the centre of his square, he stood, Tested his judgment and his promptitude: âWe'll pass the stream, and make their standards ours! The Eagle's wing shall fall beneath our powers! Yes, we'll invadeâbut not, like Hull, return, Till we gain victory, or clasp death's urn. Yea, in his forted strength, we'll Hull defy, And give him name with those of infamy. How like a dastard he from Sandwich flew, When he might swept our feebleness, like dew. Did valour warm his breast, I ne'er should dare To lead you forward to invasion there. To aid our plans, I've sent a spy before To bear him gold, with promises of more; This and his cowardice will make him yield His starry banner, when we touch the field. Held he but something vital in his blood, He might have drove the land, like fire and flood. He may pretend to give us answer stern, But never dare to brave us in return. With strength inferior, we shall victors be, And bend him low upon a prayerful knee. âRed brothers! hear my voice! In war be strongâ But when they yield, commit no blood-shed wrong. He, who shall raise his hatchet after peace, Shall kneel to death, unworthy of his race. Tecumseh, not to thee these words are said, For thou art honour to the fountain head. âNow, beat the musick and display in fileâ Soon, on the ramparts of yon height, we smile!â Brock gave the purpose of his heart and led Fourteen times fifty, royal, for the deed. Wildmen, six hundred, march in savage ranksâ Part on his rear, part scouting on the flanks. With these alone,âand mortars in his train, He hopes the fortress of Detroit to gain. At Sandwich, he embarks for Freedom's shore, And lands, uncheck'd by Hull's defended power! Firm the Columbians stood, like pointed rocks, To pour destruction on a thousand Brocks; The volunteers were placed in bolted ranks To thin the allies on the British flanks. Two engines huge were ready with their death, Stretching their jaws to breathe consuming breath; These topp'd a steepy hill:âsame time, in fort, Planted were forty brass, to blaze reportâ Trophies of ancient daringâWashington The same at York from proud Cornwallis won. Their vaulted throats yawn'd wide with threatening gloom, Backward to strike th' invaders to the tomb. Warriours, two thousand, breasted for the storm, Stood in their strength with beating bosoms warm. Their steel-crown'd bayonets glimmer'd o'er the mound An icy horrour to the Albions round; Death frown'd upon their points with fatal eye, Scowling defiance at the enemy! Yet not a bolt against the foe was driven, By dastard orders of the general given! Now Brock his cohorts having play'd in line, Despatch'd to Hull a summons to resign. Glaig he selected to convey the truce, With fear Columbia's banner to reduce. He on the parapet, like triumph, stood, Waving the flag, and made his order good: âBrock, without polish, bids me to declare, That you remove your Eagle from the air; Contract her wings in dust; or death will rage; No English arm can Indian wrath assuage. Yield without struggle, and the deed is well, Or for thy heart will savage tigers yell! Yea, dare resistanceâand the gush of blood Will wash the fort, like rivers in a flood! But strike yon standard, and the savage arm, Aim'd at thy breast, shall not that bosom harm.â Hull, as he ended, knitted up his brow With seeming anger, and bespoke the foe: âGo, tell this Brock, that I his threats defy! Behold his death! Look round and fear to die! Bear his defiance back! Mad let him comeâ His peace is made on earth,âhe crowds the tomb! Go, and return no more.ââ Bold was his tongue, As though his heart with valiant chords were strung. The messenger beheld the strength around, And felt his answer was a truth profound. Trembling he fear'd his courage would arise To make of Brock a gory sacrifice. With bosom press'dâhis features fading wan, Back he withdrewâand thus to Brock began: âI fear his heart yet brave! His strength is strong, And proud he speaks it with a haughty tongue. Yea, he pronounc'd it in a scoffing mood, To search your heart and rob it of its blood! Full in your teeth he hurlsââ Brock touch'd his breast, And scornful wheeling, his command address'd: âHe scoffs the Lion standard! Flame adjust! Put forth! His knee-print will be seen in dust! His wagging tongue is nothing but a cheat; His heart is rotten, when the war-notes beat. At the left bastion let the cannon play, And leaping shells their burning trains display. Should yonder Stars still glitter in the sky, With steel in hand we'll strike for victory!â Their brazen engines at the word they wheel'd, And fill'd with flame the circle of the field. The shells, careering from the mortars, sprung, While dire the peals reverberating rung:â Like comets, wheeling through a tortur'd sky, The bombs, enkindled, through the welkin flyâ Or, as the bedded rocks from Hecla rise, With sound of thunder rolling through the skies, Which, as they arch, leave circles in their path, Like lightnings burning on a cloud in wrath: So wheel the globes of fire:âbut yet sustains The fort no lossâbeyond, they strike the plains. Hull, in the meantime, felt his soul despair; His features, shrunken, cast a hideous air. His better hand was trembling rais'd on high, As though to blind the prospect from his eye. His left, convulsive cramp'd, was stretch'd behind, While his loose hair was scatter'd in the wind. Miller, with anguish mark'd him in his fear, And felt his heart would not the conflict bear. Soft he approach'd him, and with mildness spoke, Which by degrees subdu'd his haggard look: âO tell me where's your pain? I apprehend, Some secret ailment makes your blood descend. Had you not better from the scene withdraw; Till the last pulse beat, I'll maintain the war; Yea, till the fort melts down!âLet Brock lead forth, And death will bind his standard to the earth. See how the warriours with their matches yearn To touch the vents and let the thunders burn!â By this the traitor had made smooth his brow, And him thus answered: âTestified I know The virtue of thy heartâ'tis fire and steel Unquenchableâunsprung:âbut yet I feel Never to move, while able to remain To wave the sign to shower with fire the plain. âMuch I've recoveredâabler than I was; Go, nerve the army to maintain the cause. Yet bid them wait, till I the word shall give, Then let the enemy his death receive!â With anxious bosom, Miller him obey'd, And every word particular convey'd To each Columbian, planted at his post, To do such deeds eternity would boast. What time this pass'd, Brock toil'd in battering fray; And smoke and fire with darkness veil'd the day. Yet labour'd he in vain. At length he ceas'd His sheeted burnings on the air to waste. âHushâhush, ye Britons, hush the coward flames! The steel bears death to glorify your names! In column on!âYour royalty put forthâ Move slow, but strong, and bow them to the earth!â No breeze, no whisper travels o'er the heathâ All is deep silence, like the hour of death. The daring Briton leads his column forth, Slow, like a cloud, deep-scowling from the north. He moves upon his fate!âDestructions frown To blast his army like a tempest down. With lighted matches, the Columbians wait To catch the word to strike them desolate! Not half so strong a mother longs to hear Her dying son to whisper in her ear, And tell her news of health! Not half so strong A lover leans to catch the musick tongue Of her he loves, to thrill his vital strings By lisping to his soul unutterable things!â No: not the mother's, nor the lover's ear Is half so bent, these heavenly sounds to hear, As long the Patriots, tortur'd with desire To hear the order to elance the fire! Their souls are lost to earthâhearts leaping high, To melt th' invaders to mortality! âSmother the match! Death comes! I give the law! To rob from death, I render up the war! Extinguishâstrike the flag!âWe fill the grave! Strikeâstrikeâor nothing will have power to save!â Were the last phial of angry heaven pour'd forth, Surcharg'd with pestilence to kill the earth; Or were the sun from his firm axle hurl'd To blaze the universe from world to world; Were steadfast nature from her throne to bound And mix with chaos in the depths profound, Not to the soul could greater pause be givenâ Each heart ceas'd beating, to the centre riven! Columbia weeps. Tears of hot blood flow round, Cries of death vengeance echo from the ground. The warriours break their swords; gnash, grind their teeth; Frenzied with wrath, they stamp the dust beneath. Hell echoes with a shout in concert high, To see the banner fall of Liberty! Slow as the Patriots from the height recede, They feel their hearts with treachery's spear to bleed. At the last turn of the far-winding shore, That shows the village, they must see no more; Where proud their names they might have plac'd in years, Gazing, they lookâand linger in their tears. To them the sun, though pleasant with his light, Seems muffled dark in death's deep pall of night. CANTO V. WASHINGTON CITY. ARGUMENT. Description of the City of Washington .... Convocation of the States men of the Republick. The scene is laid at the Capitol ... The time is one day. Where the Potomack glides o'er crystal sands To wed the sea, Columbia's City stands. Freedom's Defender, when he dwelt on earth, Its limits circumscrib'd, and gave it birth; And, to exalt its character to fame, Generous bequeath'd it his immortal name. An hundred streams from Alleghany's height, Like friendship, in one bosom here unite, And seem reluctant to forsake the beach, This truth sublime impressively to teachâ That States, in sisterhood, serene will glide, Smooth like a river, till it meets the tide Of the full ocean of eternityâ When Nations, bless'd, shall hail from bondage free, The born of Virtue, heaven-ey'd Liberty. To cause the prospect of the stream to smile, Potomack bears upon its breast an isle, Adorn'd with bowers and cultivated fields, From which, in autumn, yellow harvest yields Gold to the swain, more bounteous and divine, Than all the riches of Potosi's mine: The sugar clover for the honey bee; The happy flocks, disporting merrily; The songs of mocking birds; the gentle kine, Returning homeward at the sun's decline; The floating shadows of a mellow even, Conspire to make it like a spot in heaven. The streets converging to the centre run, And at the capitol unite in one, Ever reflecting to the nation's eye, The holy symbol of its unity: Like the live veins, which, from each distant part, Bring back the blood to vitalize the heart; The heart, in turn, refines it, and propels The stream, replenish'd to remotest cells: By which mysterious round, the finest vein,â The hair-thread nerves,âthe reason-working brain,â The limbs,âthe head,âthe cunning hands,âthe feet, Are held in life harmonious and complete. And farther to cement the whole in one, To them these names were given by Washington, Who, in their virtue, had majestick stood, And for their country shed their dearest blood. Yea, at a time when Liberty had flown, And iron tyrants rul'd the earth alone: Then, Massachusetts! then, how great wert thou! A star of honour shone upon thy brow, Whose beams refulgent lit thy sisters forth To do such deeds as glorified the earth. O how the Muse thy virtues past would sing; Thy patriot love exalt on Fancy's wing; Publish thy character to nations far, And prove it brilliant as the northern star! But thou, with Faction's veil hath dimm'd thine eyeâ Thine ear is deaf against thy children's cry! Thy heart, once tender as the babes in heaven, Is now to hardness of a flint-rock given; Yea once,âAlas! those righteous days have fled,â The wreath of fame hath wilted from thy head. Hark! hear thy mariner with anguish'd tongue! He for protection to thy knees hath clung! Behold his bride, and bosom children dear, Pleading his rescue with a bitter tearâ O mark them kneeling at thy feet full low, Weeping his bondage by the ocean foe! Alas! unmov'd art thou!âor deaf, or blind, Thou spurn'st them back!âBase gold is thy mind! But once a time there was, should Albion dare To lay a finger on thy children's hair, In arms, avenging, would'st thou rise and say: âTouch not my offspring, tyrant of the sea!â My strength grows faint, my tongue denies to speak, I feel a tear-drop trickling down my cheek, That thou, my bosom Parent!âholy earthâ Who made my young heart dance to hear thy worth, Shouldst, like a comet-star, the way make bright, Which led to Liberty with Freedom's light, Now fall and lose thy brilliant path in heaven, And sink to darknessâdown to chaos driven! Then, in that trial of the soul severe, Young Hampshire rose, and seiz'd the martial spearâ From fir-cloth'd mountains and her deep defiles; From woody vales, where now fair Harvest smiles, Issu'd her sonsâStarkâAllen, led them forth In swarms, dark-pouring from the hardy north. Connecticut, with Putnam, bar'd the steel, The cause of Liberty with blood to seal; Her hoary chief, who many a fight had seen, With Warren join'd, to win the laurel green, And do that deed, which brightens as the spheres Cover the past with multitude of years. While Bunker's Height shall smile upon the wave, And spring-time flowerets bloom on Warren's grave, From heart to heart shall Putnam's memory spread, Till the last friend of Liberty is dead. Though small in compass is the Island State, Yet in those days her character was great; Green was a hostâan army to her nameâ The second chief to Washington in fame; With time, her toils for Freedom will aspire, And glow and kindle, pure as vestal fire. So long as Saratoga's plains shall bear The harvest rich with gold, or wild flowers rare, So long, O York! shall bards thy praise swell high, In notes sublime as ancient poesy. Jersey! thy streams ran purple to the sea, Shedding thy blood in torrents to be free. The spoiling foe laid thy white bosom bare, But for thy rescue, Washington was there! Immortal Penn!âO consecrate my themeâ My fancy brighten with a transient gleam Of that celestial burning of thy mind, When tyrants strove with chains thy will to bind, That my rapt soul may crowd upon my tongue, To sing thy virtue in the pride of song: Methinks I feel it glowing in my strain, But all concentres in thy deathless Wayne! Sweet-smiling Delaware!âthe ocean's bride, Few were thy offspring, but thy soul was tried; Yea, large thy soul, and strong thy pulse beat high, When Independence shouted Liberty! Thy sister caught the all-inspiring flameâ Thy deeds, O Mary! were the deeds of fame. Then, thou wert honour'd for the brave and true, Which scarce express thy patriotism due; Fill'd with the cause, thy virtues tower'd sublime, But why now creep in dust and smile on Albion clime? Ye bright-ey'd sisters of the South and North! How, in that day, ye stood majestick forth! Thy Nash, thy Sumpter, Morgan, Marion bold, On fame's proud column, place eternal hold. King's Mountain, Guilford, and the Eutaw Spring, Are themes exalted for the bard to sing; Yea, when a bard of Homer's power shall rise, His name and subject to eternalize. Laurens, the boast of that immortal age, Adorns brave history and the Muse's page, Nor towers, nor dungeons, manacles of steel, Could damp the ardour of his holy zeal: But when thick darkness compass'd him in night, His country bleeding in unequal fight, Unshaken, like a pillar'd rock he stood, Breaking the billows of the ocean's flood. Sweet at his birth the stars more bright did shineâ This, Carolina South, this honour'd child is thine! Thy fields, O Georgia! were a desert wasteâ Thou drank'st of bitterness a sickening taste; A taste! ah no: a heavy draught you took, But yet thou never, inwardly, forsook The righteous conflict:âdarken'd for a time, To shine more brilliant in thine orb sublime! Unspotted Virgin of Columbia's train! And shall the Muse forget to sing a strain Due to thy worth!âHer heart, her soul's on flame, Virginia! but to hear thy patriot name! Noânever hast thou join'd with harlots, noâ Chaste is thy virtue as the sifted snow, Or Hesper, lovely in the placid even, Leading with pride the starry host of heaven! O what a contrast with thy sister, northâ She, who once match'd thee in thy spotless worth! Her Franklins, Hancocks, Warrens, where are they? Alas! they slumber in their robes of clay! But where's the hallow'd influence of their dust That should remain? But she, begrim'd with rust, Perceives it not:âShe leagues for worthless ore With Britainâmistress of the anchor'd shore! But say, fair Virgin,âO, explain the causeâ With base exampleâthus to hold the laws Of blushing virtue!âYes, I see thee wave Thy lily hand, in mourning o'er their grave! Enough! their relicks will preserve thee pure, While Monticello, Vernon, shall endure! These names of States, the arbour'd streets receive, That to the mind, impressive, they might give This sacred truth:âthat Unity alone Secure can guard the nation from a throne. Passing these avenues, we gain the square, Shaded with elms, with poplars, locust, rare, Where in the centre is the temple seen, In which the congregated States conveneâ Or where, as now, disaster sinks the soul, By Hull's submitting to a Brock's control, The President, his counsellors of state, Convokesâthe means of safety to debate. Its marble shows the beauty of the sunâ Nor Greece, nor Rome, its workmanship outdone. Corinthian columns proud the roof uphold, Of topaz changeable, and emerald, gold. Its dome, sublime, exalts its towering brow In the blue heavens above the clouds of snow, Which in fantastic wreaths around it play, Painted exquisite with the evening ray; Or, at still noonâthe zephyrs, hush'd to rest, Delicious slumber on its curving breast. The arts of taste within the hall display Columbia's genius rising into day: Large on the left is nature copied boon, A shepherd piping to his flocks at noon, While, at the threshold of a cottage near, His heart's love listens with delighted ear. A brook seems murmuring round a rock, at play, Then on a ripple glides the chaf'd-up sprayâ And now it stands a moveless mirror clear, In which are seen the beauties of the sphere. And now, an alder stooping o'er the reef Of mossy rocks, lets fall a quivering leaf, Which on its sleeping bosom forms a blink, Whence silver rings, unbroken of a link, Gentle expand, till check'd by either shore, And the sweet wave is placid as before. A swain, embrown'd with toil, supports a plough On its rich bordersâoxen moving slow; At distance, birds, on timid wing, pursue The worms devouring as expos'd to view. Bordering this scene, beneath a curtain'd roof, A loom stands loading with the silver woof; Swift through the warp the shuttle seems to fly, The rosy damsel singing merrily. And after this, are drawn, in various parts, Impressive copies of the noblest arts; With waving flags, a ship is on the glide Down her oil'd ways, her bosom in the tide. Before the axe, the gloomy forest bows; And here the road through levell'd mountain shows. Rivers and lakes in unity are seen, By the vast labour of canals between. And last, appears the spirit-breathing press, The world, in time, with Liberty to bless. In different forms the sculptur'd arts are shown, Causing the things of life to leap from stone: The goddess Liberty attracts the sight, A cap and spear supported in her right; Her left the roll of charter'd rights is given; Her eyes seem fashion'd of a beam from heaven. Next, with his foot upon a crown, appears Great Washington, who wip'd away the tears Which stood in drops and dimm'd Columbia's eye, And open'd to the world the path of Liberty! Sage Franklin looks, the future to descry; Heaven's giant lightnings at his footstool die. His steady virtue nerv'd his country's heart; He stood a shield to ward the tyrant's dart. Now lofty paintings interest the mind, By Peal and Trumbull pencil'd and design'd; The vital colours the full image give, And every feature seems to breathe and live: Freedom's ThermopylÃ¦, renown'd in fame, Strikes awful on the view, involv'd in flame. The sword of Putnam gleams above the blast, Half hid, half seen, with blackness overcast. Warren, in blood, sinks fainting to the dust, His soul reluctant to resign her trust; He marks the Eagle as she rides on fire, And seems to say: In glory I expire! The next is Trenton, that sublimes the sight, Partial illumin'd by the half-born light. The circling hills look bleak with pil'd-up snow, Creation round stands frozen in her wo. The wintry scene brings chills upon the mind, Which thinks it hears the whistling of the windâ Turn but the eye, you glance upon a strife Of withering death-fire, searching Albion's life. Then, after others, York, in painting, shines, As proud Cornwallis renders up his lines; Bowing, obsequious, with his heart in grief, Beneath the standard of th' immortal Chief; The Eagle, towering in her pride of state, The crouching Lion fetter'd to his fate. Next are the men, who Independence spoke, And dar'd on kings to cast indignant look: First of the group, great Jefferson is seen, Whose eye shows wisdomâanimate, serene, Pondering the past with philosophick lore, The future weighing by the present hour. His dexter hand supports the roll of fame, Which gives his memory eternal name: He spoke the word,âfrom chains Columbia rose, And shouted Freedom! from despotick foes; Crowns felt a mildew; titles shrunk away; The thrones of monarchs totter'd to decay. To him the name of patriot will be given, While virtue's incense shall ascend to heaven. Then Wythe appears, august with reverend age, Who, next to Franklin, was Columbia's sage; Sublime he labour'd in the glorious cause, Friend to the friendless and to equal laws. Hewes, Heyward, Rutledge, Hopkinson, and Keith, Smith, Walton, Hooper,âbound with honour's wreath; Lynch, Wolcott, Carroll, Morris, Lewis Morris. Clymer, Paca, Chase, Morton, Taylor, Wilson, Stockton, Lee, Francis Lightfoot Lee, and Richard Henry Lee. Hancock co-equal, and an Ellery. Hart, Sherman, Lewis, Adams John Adams.âhallow'd name! Long with a Jefferson to be the theme Of Freedom's sacred day!âGerry, and Penn, Rush, Morris, Robert Morris. Harrison, the first of men. Jay, Whipple, Middleton, born to achieve What future ages doubting will believe. Gwinnet and Nelson, Livingston and Ross, Who bade defiance to the banner'd Crossâ Who counted all, save Liberty, but dross. Floyd, Bartlett, Rodney, Huntington, and Read, Of whom no trial could their souls exceed. Stone, Braxton, Witherspoon, and Adams, Samuel Adams. Clark, Bosoms that thrill'd with a Promethean spark; Hopkins, and Williams, Thornton, Paine, Robert Treat Paine and Hall, With Liberty to stand, with Liberty to fall! This the firm band that first the gauntlet hurl'd, And shouted Freedom! through a tyrant world. Now, on the pinions of the swiftest gale, Was borne the sad disaster,âsickening tale, Detroit, in Brock's command!âAt Washington, Three days before, had told how Hull had won! Thus a young bride, expecting from the sea Her bosom's joy, counts each long lagging day With aching passion, sighing to behold His star-gemm'd banner in the clouds unfold. A gallant vessel in the port arrives, And speaks of his approach!âthe sound revives Her failing heart, like musick of the bless'd, Charming the righteous to eternal rest! Three days, her eyes she fixes on the deep, To see the heavens delighted with the ship. At length, where sky and ocean kissing join, A white sail breaks the elemental line! âThis, this is mine!ââshe whispers to her soulâ My lover comes to make my bosom whole! The vessel moorsâthe light yawl leaps to shoreâ âWhat tidings of my love?â âAlas! no more! His bark has split upon a rock!â Coldâdeafâ Blanch'd is her cheekâdead, fainted in her grief. So when the city mark'd the herald's speed, Bearing the tidings of the fatal deed, She thought to hear the former pleasure spoke, How Hull the chains of royalty had broke; But when the darkness of the day was known, Like the fair bride, she petrified to stone. But when th' emotion partially was o'er, Which drove the blood, by freezing every pore, Back to the heart, the President of state, And patriots chosen to divide his weight When made oppressive by a load of care, Slow in silence to their place repair; Far in the capitol, to plan anew, How they the war, in future, should pursue. The dastard yielding has their plans made void, And all the prospect of a peace destroy'd: For had but Hull struck Canada with life, Britannia, humbled, had renounc'd the strife; But by the traitor giving her success, Her hopes were rais'd Columbia to depress. At least, to make the boundary of the north Ohio's stream, and gain her fattest earth. Now was the honour'd place of Washington Fill'd, by the people's voice, by Madison; A seat far more exalted than a throne, Or ever yet to haughty monarchs known; Lost is its height beyond the rank of king, Or sultan, emperour, or such titled thing. In vain strove Madison his grief to hide, For slow and languid flow'd his bosom's tide, Which pal'd his features with corroding care, And his eye show'd a deep affliction there.â A glowing virtue his affections warm'd, His soul, historick lore and science charm'd. When the States, loosen'd, like mad comets run, His potent reason bound them into One. Monroe, deep-mark'd with many an honour'd scar, Receiv'd while battling in the righteous war, Is next the nation's energies to wield, To bend the foe submissive on the field. His heart is honour's breast-plate, and his soul Feels nothing, save one feeling for the whole. Dallas, the justâColumbia's financier, Is seated on the right, of judgment clear. At the dark hour, when Liberty arose, He stood the shock, and brav'd her deadliest foes. The next was Hamilton, whose mental powers Sink not depress'd, when wayward fortune lowers; Nor does success in furious joy arise, Steady he moves as Herschell through the skies. With these were characters, renown'd the first, To whom the People gave th' important trust, When Congress rose, to guide their destinies, And bring their strength against their enemies: Clay, Lowndes, and Eustis, Crawford, Crowningshield, And Dearborn, once the terror of the field. The venerable Macon, long rever'd For simple mannersâto the land endear'd. The eagle-minded Clintonâchild of York, Whose Newton-genius plann'd the mighty work That weds the lake of Erie with the sea, Labour to vie with eldest history. Tompkins with honour vindicates the cause, And to maintain it, strong his falchion draws. Calhoun, with power of eloquence endued, Oft rais'd his voice against th' unfeeling brood Of Albion's voyagers, who to slavery bent The free, upon the watery element. Of generous Bayard, the boast of Delaware, His country's fame absorb'd his every care; Though that his voice dissented from the war, Yet, when declar'd, 'twas then the nation's law; That law was his, he bound it to his heart, And urg'd the means to whet the warriour's dart. Adams, the younger, worthy proves his name Of sire John Adams. and uncle Samuel Adams. first who lit the flame On Freedom's altar, never to expire, So long as wisdom feeds the holy fire; The flame will burn, while Adams shall survive, Or Jefferson in memory shall live. These honour'd names, and others, at the call, Convene in council at the nation's hall. Each in his place, the President began, While aching passions through his bosom ran: âAlas, how darken'd is this troublous day! Treason hath come, and snatch'd our hopes away! I thought him brave, and gave him the command, (He once was so,) to lead our chosen band To Vict'ry's summit! Hard, how hard to trace The hateful subjectâblacken'd with disgrace! No: not a brass he open'd on the foe, Whilst every pulse beat maddening for the blow! The theme corroding eats upon my heart, Deep at the core of life I feel the traitor's dart! âBut this, no more. We've now to bend our eye, And scan the prospect of futurity. The nation round is petrified to stone, 'Tis ours to rouse them to the combat on. The West is tumult, waiting for the word To wipe away the stain with keener sword. âForth must a navy glide on Erie's flood To guard our borders from the savage blood. The bosom of Ontario and Champlain Must the star-banner brilliantly maintain. âPerry, to rule on Erie, I'd propose; Macdonough, on Champlain, his strength disclose; The veteran Chauncy, through Ontario's waves, To bear our brass, whose thunders talk of graves. The army of the north transfer to Brown; Well do his virtues merit the renown. Let Shelby, Harrison, command the west; Invite the aged chief to wake from rest; His blade, long sleeping in its quiet sheath, Since that it labour'd in the work of death At Carolina's Mountain, King's Mountain. where he press'd The guarded foe, and bow'd the Lion's crest. âHad Hull his arm but rais'd against the Crown, The blow decisive would have wrench'd it down! What streams of blood for this must now be shed, What reckless slaughter load the field with dead! Alas! this treason, how it swells the flames, Yet those who die will gain undying names.â His tongue denies him more; his bosom sighs; His passions, labouring there, hard struggle in his eyes: Grief, anger, and contempt, by turns appear, And show him wounded with a treacherous spear. Monroe begins, with voice, and gesture mild, Though throbb'd his heart with palpitation wild: âDepressing is the loss. And sad I know, Thy bosom feels sharp anguish at the blow; The man, elected to conduct the state In scenes adverse, endures unequal weight; For every eye, throughout the nation whole, Looks up to him, as the Republick's soul; In times of peace to curb licentious wrong, The arts to cherish, and instruct the young; In times portentous, as the present war, To stand unshaken as the polar star. Though sad events our heart-strings bleeding tear, Yet should no tameness lurk insidious there. Though many a patriot is in dungeons press'd, Soon we'll redeem them to their country bless'd. Yes, these can we exchangeâbut think of those Who sought to break the shackles of their foes! Recaptur'd, manacled, compell'd to turn, And clasp with agony a strangling urn. There's respite none, for those who dare desire The mountain breath of Freedom to inspire. âAlbion! alas! how cruel is thy power! To smite thy sins the heavens will blackness lower! The blood of Virtue cries from graves beneath, To pour upon thy head the phial charg'd with death! Erin, enslav'd, our sons on ocean press'dâ Our infants butcher'd on their parent's breast, Cry to the heavens for retributive wrath, The iron hardness of thy soul to scath. âMiller, by this, is deep in dungeon laid, Far at Quebeckâhis deeds of valour made The cruel sportings of th' upbraiding tongue; But when his chains shall fall, like Samson strong, He'll strike their bosoms with avenging steel, And cause the pillars of the throne to reel. âThe theme no more.âMove must our armies forth To guard the nation on the west and north. Yes, let Ohio with Kentucky join, Albion to brave, where savage men combine. To venerable Shelby give command, Submit the army to his guiding hand. The wilderness will shudder at his name, King's Mountain hero will the wildmen tame. âThy plans of warfare on the borders round, Seem mark'd with judgment to maintain the ground. Macdonough, Perry, will the lakes defend, And Brown will cause the Lion to descend. âI Jackson would empower, Orleans to guard, And press the savage to the cold earth hard. Alas! what murder to employ their force! But he will be as lightning in their course. The hoary Stricker will defend the shore, Should the proud foe invade at Baltimore. âNow, worthy Dallas, you'll to us make known, What wealth is ours to war against the throne.â Monroe was silent. Thus the financier: âRespecting means, there's not a cast of fear. Cheerful the People bear their treasures forth, Their armies to sustain, of patriot worth. Though truth it is, a faction at the east Encourage anarchy, their birth disgrac'd! Yea, they support the enemy with gold, Whilst from the State their succour they withhold! I thought their darkness was a partial night; That soon their eyes would open to the light, And see and feel the dangers of their feud, And hold to Union for the publick good; But now I fear, such films eclipse their eyes, They'll never see, till lost their Liberties! âYet we for present need are well supplied; In this should every heart feel satisfied; Whatever plan the President pursues, The means are ample to maintain his views, Till the next Congress shall these halls make full, And guard more large against defeat of Hull.â Fast on his lips the statesmen bent to hear His valu'd accents with attentive ear; Since without wealth, war is a name that's weak, Yea, like a lamb, when led to slaughter, meek. And now the writer Secretary. for the navy rose, And thus abrupt express'd his patriot woes: âFrom what proud orbit hath our sister fell! It cramps my bosom but her deeds to tell; Lo, for a pittance on the China plant, She rent a throne, and flam'd a continent! But now, while thousands of her children mourn, Impress'd by Albion, never to return; While hundreds torn with whips and starvings die Without the blessing of a parent's sigh; No sister, brother, child, or friend, or wife, To shed one tear as they depart from life; But every groan is answer'd with a scoff, And every boast of Freedom is a laugh! Yet, while her offspring drag out life distress'd, She hugs the murderer to her monster breast! Nothing she feels: all worth from her is driven, To mark her deeds her patriots blush in heaven. âO Luxury, thou tyrant of the soul! How few have power to ward thy fell control! Rome, Greece, and Asia, sunk beneath thy sway, And through Columbia, slow I mark thy way. Yes, in the centre of the nation here, Where simple nature ever should appear To spread its wholesome influence through the State, We ape the manners of the kingly great! See trifles glitter round of every sort, And crowded levees, like a monarch's court! Here smiles are sought and purchas'dâworthless trade! And here men simper, like a love-sick maid! âLet man be man! break off this slavish chain! Prove to the world Columbia will maintain Her Independence, till the lamp of day Shall turn to blood, and nature melt away! âMy thoughts have borne me from my theme afar, To place our strength in attitude of war. âShelby has prov'd a veteran, bold to plan And executeâthe foremost in the van. When banded armies in their wrath engage, With bosom calm he guides their maddening rage. What though the nation is with gloom o'ercast, These warriours nam'd, will brighten all at last. âAnd now, our infant navy is prepar'd, To give to Britain merited reward. Our seamen burn impatient in the cause, T' avenge their wrongs and violated laws: At dawn, the Hornet in her beauty sails, Should heaven propitious breathe the favouring gales. Lawrence, with Preble noted for the brave, Will guide the war-ship tilting o'er the wave. Porter already bounds upon the sea, The Essex bears him to proud destiny; His heart is flame the battle to provoke, His soul's unbending as the mountain oak. âHope warms my bosom with a beam of light Our fleet will make the breast of ocean bright; That Biddles, Truxtons, Littles, will arise To bear our Eagles to remotest skies; And future Greens and Morgans will appear, To lead through death our arms to victory's sphere.â Thus Hamilton. And Madison rejoins, On sliding luxury, he thus refines: âJust are thy words, and mark'd with reason's stamp, Which proves thy mind enlighten'd with the lamp, That burns with wisdom's oil. My soul's in pain To scan the causes of Columbia's bane. âLuxury hath ever, ever prov'd the rock, On which Republicks in their voyage have broke. Mankind, unalter'd, ever are the same, Hence the like passions set their souls on flame; The causes now which act upon the mind Effect the same as years revolv'd behind; In modern days, as in the times of yore, We yield insensible to luxury's power; 'Tis like the serpent, in those happy bowers, Where Eve stood blushing mid celestial flowers, Winding, half seen, insinuating, sly, Rustling the leaves t' engage her lovely eye: The first of women hears, she looks:âbehold! She spies the burning serpent dropp'd with gold! Artful, at times, he glides a fiery train; At times, he seems a rainbow on the plain; Bright and more bright his varying colour shines; Charm'd and more charm'd the bride of heaven inclines. At length more bold he shows himself to view, Her tender feet intuitive pursue. He charms her onward with his sugar breath, And while he charms, he lures her to her death. âSo luxury bears our sliding minds astray, Till, imperceptible, we melt away. Our actions we must guard with jealous eye, Or farewell, Virtue! Farewell, Liberty! Merit, in want, is left to pine alone, Unnotic'd, hiss'd at, darken'd and unknown. What would become of Cincinnatus now, Were he engag'd at the domestick plough? Revil'd and spit upon, unless he shone, Deck'd in vain luxury with golden zone! These times must alter, or our country's down, She kneels in slavery to a tyrant crown. âEre that day comes, may this grey head be cold, Buried, commingled with its native mould, My children slumbering on their parent's breast, Their eyes deep-seal'd in everlasting rest.â With crowded bosom, half in tears, he sighs For Shelby to command the western lines. With heart in throb he casts an eye to heaven, That to his arm the vict'ry might be given. In part, the Deity of prayer approv'd, To aid the veteran warriour, much belov'd. This done, to others he affix'd his name, The born of Freedom to exalt their fame, Pike, Brown, and Jackson, Ripley, Gaines, and Scott, Nor from his mind was Macomb's name forgot. Smith, Stricker, Johnson, venerable Adair, Neal, the bold youth, and Croghan, passing fair. These names Monroe from Madison receiv'd, Swift to despatch them where the patriots liv'd, That they might instant to their post repair, And put to trial what their virtues were. To Hamilton, these worthies are consign'd, To rule the navy with triumphant mind; To guide, through ocean's deep, their trackless way, Or on the lakes that drink the western ray: Macdonough, Perry, Biddle, Rodgers, brave, To bear Columbia's thunder on the wave; Hull, Bainbridge, Stewart, Jones, and Worthington, Who know the art to chase, but not to run; Decatur, Blakeley, Burroughs, valiant all, To search the foe, and cause his flag to fall. This done, he thus concludes: âWe strong shall prove, While such illustrious names united move. These, by a favouring heaven, the land will save, And bring to bow the tyrant of the wave; And to the nations publish that the sea Is, as the element of nature, free! âWe yet shall rise, correct our errours past, And virtuous Freedom will return at last. Discord will die, and, lock'd in Union's chain, Sublim'd, eternal will the States remain!â When thus concluding had the statesman spoke, The august senators from council broke. The sun had set; the stars began to show, As homeward they withdrew, pausing their footsteps slow. CANTO VI. THE CRUISE OF LAWRENCE IN THE HORNET. ARGUMENT. Invocation .... The Poet's Address to the Spirit of his Mother .... Lawrence puts to sea .... The Challenge .... The Escape from Blockade .... Impressment .... The Sinking of the Peacock .... The Hornet arrives at New-York .... Lawrence visits his Family. The scene is laid at Boston, Saint Salvador, New-York and on the Atlantick Ocean .... The time is fifty-two days. Now where th' immeasurable ocean rolls His restless billows to the stormy poles, From thence, rude whirlwinds seizing, dash them forth, Scaling the heavens, mad breaking on the earth, Where the wild elements in fury play, The poet ventures his unequal lay. Spirit of Ocean!âraise the poet's mind To ride upon thy stormsâlooseâunconfin'd! Let him not sink oblivious in the deepâ But let his pinions o'er thy wildness sweep. He feels his strength unequal to the theme, But O, illumine with a lightning gleam The midnight of his soul! Stretch broad his wings, New-fledg'd, to mount high-soaring as he sings. Where rapid Charles Charles River. completes his devious way, Boston with beauty rises from the seaâ What means this pauseâthis grief? What icy chills Pass through my curdling blood! What pressure fills And crowds my bursting heart! Why doth my soul Rush to my eyes and cause my tears to roll? O Boston! it is thou, delicious earth, Fair Queen of cities, giver of my birth! 'Tis thy dear name that drowns my soul in tears, And brings to memory days of long-past years; The sweets, the bitterness of every scene, And makes me shiver with reflections keen. From thee, reluctant, have I roam'd afar, And led my wanderings by the western Star. Deceitful Star! thou'st lur'd me to my doom; I live on charityâno blessedness of home! I bound my elder brother to my breast, Clasp'd his warm hand, with speechless grief oppress'd; Our swollen eyes with deep emotion met, The glance, O never will my soul forget! Our left, upon our stooping foreheads kept; Our right hands lock'd; we turn'd; in silence wept; The tears gush'd faster. How, I cannot tell, Our grasp was loos'd. No utterance bade farewell! He was a brother to my bosom dear. Where dwells he now? The question starts a tear. Ask the cold grave.â My soul, indulge thy grief, Its hallow'd tears will minister relief! Though born in poverty's bleak, shivering stormâ Felt the sharp pangs of hunger's gnawing worm; Yet still, O still a mother's smile was mine, To soothe my soul with tenderness divine! Oft hath she given the last poor remnant crumb, While her moist eye would smiling bid me come, Rich like the bow upon the cloud of even, Giving large promise of sweet hope from heaven. She, her own pangs of hunger would suppress, And look like gladness, while she felt distress. But should I then, with want, complaining cry, A tear would start and trickle from her eye! My heart! burst, break and die! alas! control Who can abide, when anguish tears the soul! Maternal Shade! thy tears shall stream no more, Basking in light on heaven's luxurious shore! But O, on earth deign not thine eye to bear, Or thou might'st weep to see me in despair; Yea, thou might'st weep to see th' oppressing weight, That bends me down to unrelenting fate. Yet, O my mother! mid this wretchedness, One joy is mine to lighten my distress; Her soul is like theeâO, the very same, For she can make despair itself grow tame. Oft in the rack of misery I've said: âWhen shall I steep my sorrows with the dead?â Placid she'd come, and lean upon my breast, And smile so sweet, 'twould soothe my grief to rest! Yes, my Eliza hath a form like thineâ She, (thou art absent) is the all of mine. O grace her with thy charms, whilst here thou mov'd, Virtue's bright ornamentâby all belov'd! Teach her with truth to imitate thy deedsâ To trace the path, where thy bless'd radiance leads; Then let misfortunes frown, with her I'll soar, And smile serene, when billows round me roar. Far from her theme my wandering Muse has stray'd, To weep delicious o'er a mother's shade; Such holy drops what heart would wish to dryâ Pure as the moisture in an angel's eye. 'Tis evening now. As twilight gleams recede, The golden lamps on oil celestial feed. High in the arch of heaven, the crescent star Brightens her hornsâher silver beams afar Illume the waves, that silent bathe the shores, The rocking vessels, islands, hills and towers. On Boston's moon-lit wave the Hornet rides, Turning obsequious to the changing tides. Laden'd with life and all the means of death, Ready to spread her wings on heaven's sweet breath, At York had Lawrence left his bride behind, To trust his fortune to the waves and wind. Two happy infants smiled upon her heartâ The care of whom reliev'd a bitter part Of Lawrence, absent on the wide waste sea, Expos'd to tempests and the enemy. Yet would a truant tear-drop frequent stroll Down her fair cheek expressive of her soul. These names to Lawrence bear inferior rule, Bred to the naval art in Truxton's school: Getz, Shubrick, Newton fill'd with valour's breath, To war unyielding on the tide of death; Smoot, Cooper, Beorum, Mayo, Corner,âtrain'd To wipe away the blot by Albion stain'dâ Impressment!âoutrage, madness to the brainâ The hardest link in slavery's cramping chain! Now, in smooth dreams, they sleep their cares away, Fresh at the dawn to navigate the sea. Twice every hour, the watch-guard speaks all well; Counts the live stars, that round the moon beams dwell; The echo travels through the air profound O'er the still wave and answering shores around. At length the lamps, that lighten heaven, decayâ Soft in a dewy mist ascends the day; The spires of holy temples catch the gleam, And sweet reflect it on the ocean stream: Throu'd on a cloud of gold, the sun peers forth, And light and life come dancing o'er the earth. From beds of flowers, delicious breezes play, Inviting to the main the ship away. Lawrence, at dawn, arose with brightening look, Pip'd hands adeckâwith quickening impulse spoke: âBehold the zephyrs call us to the sea! Haste, man the shrouds! th' imbedded anchors weigh! In southern latitudes, the Stars unroll, And bind the ocean tyrant in control. Now dread Impressment cruelties no moreâ Lo, Albion strikes beneath our rising power!â The heroes caught the language of his tongue, And felt their bosoms loosen'd from the wrong Of Britain, slaving on th' infranchis'd sea, Their brothers, fathers, chain'd with tyranny: Like them did Ulysses, in beggar dress, Receive the insults of the suitors' raceâ Hiss'd, spit uponâassail'd by many a blow, Stooping his spirit to his days of wo. Yet oft he'd cast imloring eye to heaven, To learn when retribution would be given. Lo, while depress'd and sinking in despair, Minerva clove the element of air, Disguis'd within the beauty of a dove, Sent to reveal the purposes of Jove: âBehold, I bear the message of the skies! Past are thy griefs! To ample vengeance rise!â He heard the musickâforth his soul took fire, And nought but thunder could suppress his ire: So when brave Lawrence gave the word to weigh, That now was come the retribution day, The seamen drank his voice and thought it heaven, Such glow of feeling to their souls was given. Minute the crew each circumstance obey; The flook slow rises from th' adhesive clay; A part, with nimble sinews, climb the shrouds, And spread the canvass in the flying clouds. Now, in her loveliness, the vessel sails, Her wings expanded to the breathing gales. Smooth as she travels to the eastern sky, Hills, shores, and islands, seem retiring by. No bride of beauty ever stepp'd more gay, While round her bosom flies the glittering spray. Pure in the mist, that dances from below, The sun paints rainbows, curling round her prow. As when a shepherd from a beetling height, 'Gainst which the ocean long had spent its might, Beholds a silver cloud through ether driven, Exquisite painted with the tints of heavenâ He gazes on its charms with ravish'd sight, Till slow it vanishes in trembling light: With equal grace the gliding ship appears, Till lost through distance in the arching spheres. The same time Boston, from the sailor's eye, Receding dwindles in the far-blue sky. Soon all is dreary emptiness around, Save the vast dome Of the State House. that reaches heaven profound. The western landscape glimmering on his view, He waves his hand, and bids his hills adieu. And now the wilderness of waters roll, Illimitable deepâwithout control; The vast expanse gives freedom to the mind, To breathe full life, unshackled, unconfin'd. The sun, high centred, pours his brilliant shine, The golden key-stone of the arch divine. Fresh blow the breezes with exertion strong, And dart the war-ship through the waste along. For twice six days the billows round her roar, But on the next, she touches Salvador. Lawrence drops anchor at the straitâfor lo! He marks in port the standard of the foe. The vessel harbour'd was the Citoyenne, Of heavier mettle and superior ton, Waiting the favour of a gale to weigh To bear her freighted wealth to Canada, To be deliver'd into Proctor's handsâ A man of blood, to lead the savage bands, And to allure them with enticing gain, To scalp the weak and crash the infant's brain. The silver-laden'd bark was rul'd by Green, Whose soul felt joy, when dim the stars were seen; But now, while brilliant, they illum'd the cause, His heart turn'd coward to provoke the wars. Oft had he seiz'd the free upon the wave, And held them hard to service, like a slave: Like iron tyrants, when they meet their foe, Prepar'd to deal a recompensing blow, Shrivel their features with disorder paleâ Their liver'd hearts in mean submission quail: So Green, when he the Eagle vessel saw, Felt all the courage of his heart withdraw. But Lawrence, when he spied the foe at hand, With cannon's voice, invited him from land. But this serv'd nothing to awake his blood: Green's ear was deaf to hear him on the flood. Still Lawrence inward burnt to test his power, And cause the Eagle in the flames to tower, Or let her sink with her defenders dead, And thus to Cooper his intention said: Brave son of ocean! forth with banner goâ And bear my challenge to the harbour'd foe. Invite him ship to ship in dubious fray, And try whose ensign shall maintain the day. Whose standard waves, he bounteous shall impart Sweet mercy, incense to the bleeding heart.â The gallant Cooper with the message flew, Waving the truce upon the Albion's view. The bargemen bending as they strike away, Quick darts the light yawl tilting in the bay. It makes the vessel. Cooper boards.âIn brief, He speaks his coming to the English chief: âBriton! I bear the challenge of the braveâ Lawrence, of Hornet, on the yonder wave. Though that thy bark outbears his ship in power, From war he shrinks not, at the present hour. Whoe'er the victor prove, shall mercy show, And soothe the vanquish'd in his bleeding wo.â He spoke with dignity. The boasting Green Stands pall'd to silence with a changing mien; But soon recovering, with proud tongue replies: âBear him this answer: None of England flies! With arm unconquerable we rule and reign, And bear alone the trident of the main! âBut thou hast call'd in most unfavour'd hour, For I so deep am with Potosi's ore, No single gun upon his ship would bear, Hence he, at present, must excuse me there. But were I freed of this unwelcome freight, My pride would be to close with his invite.â Contempt flash'd sneeringly from Cooper's eyeâ Gloomy he turn'd, not deigning to reply. The light yawl leaping through the water flies Back to the channel where the Hornet lies. With nimble feet, he sprung where Lawrence stood, And thus declar'd the message of the flood: âBehold the Briton shuns the proffer'd fight; His mean excuse is gold and silver freight! But by his stammering, as he made reply, And white and red, that quiver'd round his eye, I thought him frighten'd with the Hornet's stingâ Blanch'd but to view the lightning of her wing.â Lawrence made answer: âEre he leaves the shore, We'll give him time to disembark his ore. Mark you how soon they doubt their boasted powers, They dread the Eagle when in wrath she towers. How soon this dastard would impress us all, Had we, as once, no thunder pois'd with ball, Ready to quicken at the touch of fire, And cause these ocean prowlers to expire! But now, prepar'd to vindicate our right, They pale, they shrink to meet us in the fight. âGreen, we'll imprison hereânor shall he go, Unless he gulphs us in the wave below. âNor night, nor day, the Eagle winks an eye, Guarding the pass, with lover's jealousy.â His purpose is obey'd. His watching crew, With burning vision, keep the foe in view. Oft t' allure the enemy to sea, The Hornet leaves the strait at liberty, And winds, eccentrick, in her compass round, But not beyond the reach of plummet's sound. Green thus is tempted to unfurl his sails; But, as they swell before the ocean gales, He marks the Hornet, bearing down, ahead, And forth retires to shun the conflict dread. For thirty suns, thus Lawrence made it vain For Green to reach the circle of the main. At length, upon the thirtieth day, at even, The sun yet lingering in the west of heaven, In the far south a heavy sail appears, Like a vast cloud slow rolling up the spheres; But soon the vessel gaining on the view, She proves of royal nameâthe Montague. Lawrence a moment kens her with his glass, And forth these orders through the Hornet pass: âBehold a three-tier'd thunder-ship in sight! Quick spread the canvass to avoid her might! The helm bear down, and make the port at hand, And seek protection from the neutral strand.â Swift as sound travels was the mandate doneâ Rapid as light, before the wind they run; The ship, protected in the harbour, rides, As the stars quiver in the dancing tides. Soon a thick mist conceals the ocean far, And shrouds the sparkle of each trembling star; A solid darkness folds the wide waste round; A deep death silence locks the world profound. A thought struck Lawrence, daring in his soul, To fly the harbourâgain the ocean's roll. His valour scorn'd the fetters of blockade, And, to his crew, this inspiration said: âSailors! how beats the heart?âto bend the kneeâ Debarr'd the circle of the ocean free? Lie here, perhaps, for months without our fameâ Sicken and die of fever's wasting flame? No: never!âtake advantage of the night, Whilst every star is smother'd of its light, And run the foe!âPropitious breezes now Come with sweet musick from the mountain's brow! Hide every taper dark; unbreathing, still, Let the soft gales the gib and foresail fill. Thus deep imbosom'd in the night we'll shun The island ship, and gain a healthier sun.â Their every vein seem'd flowing as with fire To do the deedâtheir favourite chief's desire. Without a sound, the anchor is upweigh'dâ And gib and foresail to the breeze display'd. Slow moves the vessel by the mountain's breath, While all is darken'd as the grave of death. And now, on board the Montague, appear Her taper lights, by which their course they steer. Dim in their view they mark the night-watch stand, And hear his voice grum echo round the strand. Not in the Hornet is a whisper said, She travels soft, as spirits round the dead; Each heart throbs wildly with its hope and fear, As close they brush the monster vessel near. So when the hunter Boon, in days of yore, The mountain pass'd, Kentucky to explore, Jealous the wildmen trail'd upon his pathâ Sudden they sprang, and seiz'd him in their wrath. Cruel, with double thongs they bound him tight, Stretch'd on the cold earth, naked to the night; When day's swift coursers shall regain the east, Fix'd they resolve upon his flesh to feast! Dreaming of blood, they compass him around, Sleeping feet inwardâhatchets on the ground, Ready at waking, on their prey to seize And do such deeds as make the bosom freeze! But sleep is not to Boon. As midnight dews Chill his bare breast, he plans his cords to loose; Slow, soft he rises, lest the Indians wake, And seize, and bind, and waste him at the stake. He steps with feet of down, and even fears The beatings of his heart the savage hears! A trembling hope runs fearful through his blood To reach his safety in the trackless wood: Such is the feeling of the patriot crew, As close the Hornet sweeps the Montague; At times, their hearts throb wildâat times, at rest, They seem a weight suspended in their breast. At length they gain the sea! Strange joy returnsâ With glowing transport, every fibre burns. The ship leaps on new pinionsâbreezes riseâ The fire of ocean kindles as she flies. The winds, reviving, dash the mists awayâ The moon, the stars upon the waters play, Like infant deities in golden tires, Dancing to musick of the heavenly quires. Cheer'd with the radiance of their beams divine, The Hornet cleaves earth's centre-halving line. For three bright days she holds the northern courseâ Though strong the gales, not turbulent their force; Visits Pernambuco; thence, holds her way To Cubaâround the shores of Florida. And now, with gentle zephyrs smooth, she veersâ And soon the Peacock in full dress appears. Now from the splendid chambers of the east, The morning rises, blushing o'er the waste Of moving oceanâwonderous to beholdâ Lining the bosom of the deep with gold, Spangled with diamonds, beautiful as heaven, When the first brilliance to the stars was given. Early at dawn, the Peacock, in her pride, Beheld the Hornet distant on the tide; Loose-flying in the clouds her streamers shone, While her rich plumes gave beauty to the sun. This Bird in flowing robes from Albion came, The vision'd Eagle to make blind with flame; And now beholds the insect Hornet far, Her wings expanded eager for the war. Peak, with a heart so harden'd on the sea, 'Twould frictive wear the firmest steel away; Held the first rule by virtue of the throneâ And next to him, emphatick, was a Stone. These boastings grated from his iron throat, Compar'd to which, the midnight screecher's note Is touching musick, bearing off the soul Beyond the anguish of this mortal dole: âBehold that saucy insect on our lee! A blast will strike her to eternity! Whence comes this rising of our slaves? a race That never dar'd to look us in the face? For years we've press'd them to defend the Crown, Nor once they dar'd resist us with a frown. Preposterous!âfight Britannia, who controls Each drop of water that the ocean rolls! Has not our flag borne terrour through the world?â And, in defiance, are their Stars unfurl'd?â Sudden he paus'd:âfor lo, four seamen cameâ The sons of Freedom, touch'd with holy flame To mark their nation's bannerâTompson, West, And Giles, and Bennett, from the Hesper press'd, Ten bleeding years and past!âTheir youthful glow Is faded from their cheekâpale blanch'd by wo. Deep in their eye, a cast of something dwelt, Which spoke what inward they severely felt. Their country, fathers, brothers, and their friends Had often pleaded with their tyrant fiends; But they, these tyrants, made their pleadings vain, By artful them transferring round the main,â From ship to ship,âa never-ending chase; Beyond the power of friendship e'er to trace. When thus secur'd, this mockery they'd speak: âNone such have we;âbut through the vessel seek; Them gladly we'll release!â Wasting with grief Their mothers pin'd away. In sad belief That they had travell'd to death's dreary bourn, Their wives the dark habiliments had worn. Their children's cries, bereft in tender age, Had told the world their helpless orphanage! But yet they liv'd, if breathing is to live, Press'd with the iron weight which tyrants give! Oft had they been in sight of that dear earth, On whose soft lap they found their happy birth; A tide of tears would trickle down their cheek, But nothing dare they of their sorrows speak; For when that they their right to Freedom urg'd, With damning whips their holy flesh was scourg'd! When they their nation's flag beheld in air, They rose the deck to shun the brewing war. Tompson drew near the stern reproachful Peak, And thus, what honour was, began to speak: âBy that just right which valiant men bestow, We crave indulgence to depart below. Behold yon flag, that floats upon the breeze! War must decide the freedom of the seas. Let not our hands the blood of brothers shedâ Let not that weight descend upon our head! The deed, unnatural, would eclipse yon light, And league high heaven against thee in the fight!â âWherefore is this?âAnd care I ought for heaven? I heaven shrink back; from hell will power be given! Slaves! are ye not slaves?âDare ye to be seen Here, where the officers of Kings convene? I thought the boatswain had your pride subdu'd With whips, and fetters, and the want of food? âNo more!âbut instant to your place repair, Or, Stone, advance, and cast their brains in air!â Stone shows his rocky heart: âBrief your behest Shall be obey'd.â This said, at Tompson's breast He plants the weapon bent!ââTo quarters hie! Attend the summons presently, or die!â Tompson stood firm, and stripp'd his bosom bare: âHere lies my heart! I'd rather death, than war! âYour whips, your fetters, nor the want of food, Will ever tame the drops of Freedom's blood! Cut to the centre of the life, and there You'll find the drops unalter'd by despair! No: never, never will I lift this hand Against the kindred brothers of my land! Ye murderers, take my blood!âit warm shall flow, Ere that I strike yon Eagle with a blow! High heaven will pour red vengeance for my bloodâ Yea: thou wilt fall beneath a frowning God! A righteous spirit on the wave will come Dread to pronounce thy deep, thy final doom! Mark, mark my words!âthy tyrant reign is done! This war's the setting of thy naval sun!â During this speech, Stone often made assay To spring the lock, and cast his life away. Now he'd retire, advance, and then recedeâ Then curse his heart to rush and do the deed. But when the words were utter'd: âsetting sun!â It caus'd his blood so violent to run, He rais'd the weaponâflam'd it at his breast! The Patriot, smiling, sunk away to rest. As some proud dome, whose summit reaching heaven, Parted the clouds along the welkin driven,â Bas'd on a granite rock, unshook by time,â Long it defied the elements sublime; A ball of thunder, bending from its path, Roll'd through the middle heavens with reddening wrath, And struck it, envious of its height profoundâ It fell, majestick in its ruins round: So Tompson fell beneath the stroke of deathâ âGod save my country!â was his latest breath. The three remaining, kindled into fire To see their brother, massacred, expire; With desperate hand they rush'd upon the foe With whetted dirksâdefiance on their brow! Blood smok'd upon their steel! Three tyrant's cheek Turn'd pale with death's approach;âbut Stone and Peak, By shrinking backward, sav'd them from the knife, Which gleam'd with hot impatience for their life! But soon the crew came rushing on their rear With swords, with knives, with boarding-pike and spear, And gor'd their vitals with the wounds of deathâ But Bennett thus, as he resign'd his breath: âDread heaven! where stay thy thunder-bolts to smite These tyrants, hell-inspir'd, to spectred night? In what dark chambers are thy lightnings staid? O where these ministers of vengeance laid? âAlas!âthe pulses of my life are runâ Tyrants! this war thy naval power is done!â When each was slain, Peak rais'd his hideous tongueâ These grating accents through the vessel rung: âThus traitors die! Now show a trembling world, An English standard never shall be furl'd! Yon Eagle, buoyant on the clouds, shall downâ Her conquer'd crew pray mercy of the crown: But mercy none have we; none, none for them; Down let them strangle in the ocean's stream!â Monster! thy boast of murder is in vainâ Fate has decreed thy period on the main! The Albion crew, with shouting triumph, crowd The swelling sails to meet with Lawrence proud. Now when the Hornet on the deep sea spied The royal Peacock in her gorgeous pride, The breast of Lawrence for his country thrill'dâ A ray of heaven his orbs of vision fill'd: As when a youth, in Massachusetts born, Rais'd to the culture of the tassell'd corn, Hears of the land of promise in the west, And feels a stirring passion in his breast To quit his rocky hills and plains of sand, And prove the fatness of Kentucky land; With tear-brimm'd eye, he leaves his native spotâ NeverâO never from his heart forgot! Absence will make its sandy plains appear Like powder'd diamonds to his memory dear; And the rough hills, where scarce his plough could pass, Will bring to thought the bosom of his lass, Swell'd with the sighs of love!âHe travels forthâ Forsakes his allâthe kindred of his birth. For many days he journies weary on, His eye at evening opposite the sun. At length, he gains the mountains, that divide The rivers east, from Mississippi's tide; With heavy feet he climbs the steep path slow, Where thousand springs of Junietta flow. Hard as he tugs his way from height to height, The mount becomes more barren to his sight; At last he gains the steril summit bare, Forever chill'd with winter's blighting air; The cold dead soil but yields the bramble thorn, With here and there a widow'd birch forlorn; His bosom settles lonesome with the scene; A heavy gloom is shadow'd o'er his mien. But lo, he gains the prospect of the west! The sight unbounded sublimates his breast. Lifted to heaven, his eyes with wonder glow To mark the various world, that smiles below; Hills, cities, rivers, in glad prospect shine, And feed his soul with ecstacy divine: After long labour, prompted by his zeal, Such luxury of soul did Lawrence feel, To mark the foe advancing from the east, Deck'd like a bride to grace a marriage feast: âBehold the Albion banner in the sky! The time is now to give to memory Your names, freeborn; by doing acts to live, While mortal dust shall breathing life receive. âMates! bear the ship the weathergage to gain, Then, down upon the enemy amain;â Let every eye be kindled into warâ Reveal'd, what spirits in your bosoms are! The murder'd Pierce will visit us in fight, And nerve our arm to vindicate our right! Should victory smile, let generous feelings glow, Nor add cold insult to a conquer'd foe.â These warm expressions animate his crew;â They beat the ocean angling, to his viewâ But soon impatient, they renounce the wind, And bear to battle with a burning mind. Board touching board, they meet!âExplosions roar So vast, they lumber to the distant shore; Each by the other passes in a blaze, Which strikes the ocean monsters with amaze. The smoke, slow folding on the light breeze west, Reveals the Peacock bloody on her breast: But no red drop the Hornet's wing distainsâ Yet still the Briton, smarting with her pains, Wears round to strike the Hornet through her lifeâ But wild, at random, she repeats the strife. Again they pass, and as they pass they roll A peal to search the other to the soul. With same effect the Patriots pour'd the round; The Peacock's thunder vanish'd with its sound. Stone, weltering in the carnage dire, is seen Cursing his God with a distorted mein. Lawrence, at length, proclaims the grappling word: âDown on her quarter!ârun her down on board!â With shout triumphant is the order done; A death-fire streaming from their every gun. Deep drove, with rapid hand, the striking balls Break the ribb'd hulk, while many a Briton falls. The groans came mingled with the smoke and fire; The Peacock gasps for life, involv'd in darkness dire. Thus in the virgin morn of sugar May, When lovers meet to give their hearts away, The sun all lovely on his throne comes forth, Clad in gold vestments, pouring heaven on earth. Lo, in the west a darken'd spot appears, Which, thickening deep, soon spreads along the spheres, And wraps the universe in smothering shroudâ Lightning and thunder breaking from the cloud. The beauty of the sun is veil'd in nightâ Or, if he shows the image of his light, 'Tis like the moon, when darken'd in her course, Eclips'dâslow moving on a midnight hearse: Like this, the Peacock:âshiver'd every plumeâ Her former beauty chang'd to death's deep gloom; Her deck is thicken'd with congealing blood; Through fractur'd ribs, strong leaps the rushing flood. The cruel Peak lies cramp'd upon the deck, His fever'd life streams spouting from his neck. Now weeping signals on the wreck are hung, Which to the victors call with silent tongue To save them, sinking!âLawrence learns their wo, And all the springs that feed his heart o'erflow: âBehold, the prize with death is overcast! Root from your breast the mem'ry of the past! Extend the hand of mercy to redeem The conquer'd Britonsâsave them from the stream! Let every deed of darkness be forgivenâ To bless a bitter foe, the sweetest theme of heaven!â The closing word was utter'd with an eye Fill'd with a gem of holy jewelry. Shubrick is first;âHart, Cooper, Williams, Boyd, Whose noble bosoms never were alloy'd With baser mettle than of gold refin'd, When a sad signal floated on the wind. Numbers they rescue from the swallowing deep, And safe conduct them to Columbia's ship. Thy dying Peacock prompts to every haste, So fast she settles in the chilling waste Of drowning watersânever to behold The setting sun to line the sea with gold! At this sad instant, Williams, Boyd, and Hart, Of self unmindful, could they but impart Life to their enemy!âeven to Stoneâ Now faint and bleeding with a fractur'd bone. Safe had they borne him to the vessel's side, Just as her deck was level with the tide! âToo late!âalas! too lateâwe sinkâwe die! But O, how bless'd is this eternity!â This said: They wav'd a tender hand to tell To Lawrence weeping,âlong, their last farewell! Their right, firm press'd, was to their bosoms givenâ Thus sunk the Patriots with their eyes to heaven! What eye can look upon a scene like this, And not feel that which ne'er before was his? A heavy weight, so pressing on the heart, As though the body and the soul would part! Immortal Three! though ocean bathe your breast, Your names shall be remember'd with the Bless'd! No virtue this exceeds. What tongue of earth, Can speak the action equal to its worth! Man might have bow'd to death his friend to save; Yea, stand and smile superior to the grave: But O, what man of men, to save his foe, Would bathe his bosom with the ocean's flow? None, none of earthly form! I felt a tear Steal on my cheek to mark you on your bier; But lo, a smile swift chas'd the drop away To find such virtue wrapp'd in mortal clay! The Muse grows faint. Bright angels! touch the string; The deed immortal, every seraph sing! Hear it, Celestials!âDied to save their Foe! In heaven repeat the strain till sweet it sounds below! Columbian Mariner!âhow great thy soul! What proud emotions through thy bosom roll! The Muse in vain attempts to sing thy worth; Not half thy praises can she utter forth. How generous is thy heart! how large thy mind! Historick virtues thou hast left behind. As heaven's pure light excels the glow-worm's rays, So do thy deeds outshine all former days; Yea, thou fair Mercy, strivest to outvie With noble acts to bless thine enemy! An enemy, who oft hath made thee bleed, And pour'd their hate in phials on thy head! Who, with blood-scourges tore thy hallow'd fleshâ If plead'st thou Freedom, keener was the lash! Who, in pent dungeons made thy heart's blood sigh, Where thoughts of kindred gemm'd with tears thine eye! Who dragg'd thee from thy home, where smiles gave bliss, To drink the dregs of Slavery's bitterness! Starv'd thee in chains! Death's agonizing hour Will be more gentle than their mildest power! Thy brother's widow loads the air with sighs, Whilst trembling on her arm her orphan cries: âWhy, O my mother?âwhy let fall these tears? O from thy bosom cast these death-cold fears! My father will return! Come, smile in joy, And soothe the anguish of thine only boy!â Alas, fond youth!âthy father clasps his urnâ Murder'd by Britonsânever to return! Canst thou, brave Mariner! these crimes forego, And with sweet mercy treat thy merc'less foe? Thou canst,âfree-bosom'd! Hear it, Albion's Crown! The poet trembles as he writes it down; Angels in heaven! the theme demands your songâ O give it anthem with immortal tongue! Peak in his nation's banner is enclos'd, With not a foible of his heart expos'd; The solemn service of the burial read, Beside his ship, slow sinks the pale cold dead. The captur'd Britons every care receive, That in the reach of Lawrence's power to give. Both wounded and unwounded, wreck'd of all By swift disaster of the Peacock's fall, With tender hearts the mariners supplyâ Equal dividing with their enemy! The generous offering, ardent from the soul, Caus'd many a tear of gratitude to roll Soft o'er the captive cheek. Worshippers of kings, Like them, not all are iron-hearted things. Lawrence now finds his narrow ship so press'd, Cumber'd with men, that they his powers arrest; Hence on the quarter he his crew invites, And thus to them his purposes recites: âFor signal favour of supporting heaven, Let solemn praises from the heart be given! âPatriots! yon vessel Espeigle. near the distant shore, Waving the Cross, oft tempts my soul with power To bear the Hornet down upon her lee, And strike her standard flat upon the sea. This is my soul:âbut when I turn my eye, And see our captive friends in misery,â Yes, captive friends!âa foe, when bleeding laid, He to my bosom is a brother made;â To see them thusâand hear them groan their painâ This second conquest of my soul restrain. And cramp'd, confin'd, in every part on board, What the heart prompts, not them can we afford. And to expose them, certain as they lay, Reckless to death, should we provoke the fray, Would prove our hearts were savage in extreme, Which not an age of virtue would redeem. âThese are my motives not to seek the foe, And plant another laurel on our brow. By soft expression mantling in your eyes, Willing your hearts renounce the enterprize. âNow, to his station each!âBefore the wind Full spread the sheets, and leave the south behind. York is the harbour of my soul to gain, And there we'll ease the labours of the main.â The Hornet heard. She spreads her wings and flies. In three bright suns the gilded turrets rise, Sweet like enchantment pictur'd in the west, When the sun lingers to his bed of rest. The fleetest gales of heaven delicious blew, To bear the vessel on her compass true; Her motion seem'd not sailing, but a flight, So quick she darted through the waters light. Her thunders speak, as enters she in portâ Returning answers deafened from the fort, Bearing the second name of honour yetâ A name by freemen hallow'dâLa Fayette. Lawrence (his vessel anchor'd) makes the shore, While thousand voices through the welkin roar. Mild on his cheek a modest blush appears, Though gaz'd as one descended from the spheres. Now when the shoutings, greeting him, were o'er, Which seem'd to start the pillars of the shore, Domestick love, the hero's bosom warm'd; He sought his Julia, whose bright virtues charm'd His heart far absent on the ocean stream; And oft her image bless'd him in his dream. Her form was beauty, and her jet-dark eye Beam'd to the soul a pure divinity. Her infants, pillow'd on her bosom, smileâ No angel cheek their dimples would defile; Attractive graces round their features play, Like dew-drops dancing on the rose of May. As Lawrence enter'd his serene abode, Gladdening his heart, divinest passions glow'd; A mortal, rising to the mansions bless'd, Such the wild joy that shiver'd in his breast. His bride had heard the shoutings of his fame, Which caus'd a holy thrilling of her frame; She rose with trembling;âgushing from her eye, Pure as divine, a liquid ecstacy. âMy husband!âlo, 'tis he!â Her tongue denies One accent moreâSweet on his breast she dies! She wakens lost in life!âLips quivering join, Transported at the touch!âTears floating shine On diamonds set in heaven. No breathing heardâ Tongues chain'd in passion, lisp no stammering word. Their eyes speak all!âin holy trance they roll, And glance the language inward to the soul. At length, th' emotion of their souls subsides, Slow, like the ebbing of the full-moon tides. His eye is bent upon his infants' charms, Reclining sweet upon the nurse's arms; Tender he folds them to his beating breast, Feeling those joys that never were express'd. Rapid his thoughts to future prospects rollâ And thus his tongue gives utterance to his soul: âThese treasures, Julia, to our care are given, To guide their truant feet the way to heaven: Then they, a blessing to our age will prove, And sweet requite us for our parent love. Yes, when our heads shall whiten into snow, And our frail limbs shall totter as we go, Then they, a crutch on either side will be To aid our progress to eternity! And when that final, solemn hour shall come To call us forth to slumber in the tomb; Then the soft whispers of their angel breath Will smooth the roughness of the bed of deathâ Yea; make it softer than the bridal even, When happy spirits hymn the songs of heaven! âO, I have heard the shouting voice of fameâ A thousand tongues have echo'd forth my name; But the pure glowings of domestick bliss, Surpass the joys that millions can express!â At times, his tears in rich abundance flow'dâ At times, he stammer'd with impassion'd load. His bride of beauty leant upon his arm, Raptur'd in tears, that heighten'd every charm. This passion staid, he to attendants by The babes presentâbut they instinctive cry, And cling around his neck. With balmy kiss, He soothes their bosoms into tenderness. The parents gaze, and see new charms arise, Like virgin beams that mantle in the skies. In fond delight they pass the golden evenâ Delicious foretaste of the bliss of heaven. CANTO VII. THE CRUISE OF THE CHESAPEAKE. ARGUMENT. Lawrence receiving orders to command the Chesapeake .... Takes leave of his Family .... Infernal Agents .... Lawrence sails to meet the Shannon .... Mutiny .... Celestials in heaven .... The battle .... The Death of Lawrence. The scene is laid at Washington .... New-York .... Boston .... On the White Mountains .... and on the borders of the Atlantick ocean. The time twelve days. Ye happy pair! enjoy th' ambrosial hourâ Intwine your brows with transport's dewy flowerâ O seize the sugar'd moments as they rollâ As boreal light, flits pleasure from the soul! Soon trouble comes to snatch the glittering prizeâ I mark it scowling in the darkening skies! What time the earth revolves from west to east, Nine circles round, delicious on a feast Of love, soul-blessing,âLawrence pure, refin'd, Luxurious banquets, in the bliss of mind. Oft he the fulness of his joy betrays, By the big tear that from his eye-fount strays, Lucid like molten silver down his cheeks, Which the soul rapture of his heart bespeaks. On the tenth morn, the sun with beams of gold Creation gilds with beauties manifold, Witching the eye, enchanting to behold. The pictur'd Heavens in peerless light rejoiceâ The jocund Earth sweet pipes with mellow voice. But what is this deep-touching of its light, Like the dark finger of approaching Night? 'Tis the dun circle of the hovering Moon, Breaking the full-orb'd image of the Sun! Smit as with awe of his superior name, Timid she seems to quench his golden flame; But, in her progress, by degrees she finds His dazzling radiance from the world she blinds. Embolden'd thus, her darkness deeper grows, Regardless of his heaving sweating throes, Like some fair spirit, striving to get free From a grim spectre of hell agency. The Sun looks smother'd with a strangling painâ But all his labouring agonies are vain; The shrouding Moon deep coffins him around, And holds him struggling in thick night profound! The time the moon upon the sun was seen, The earth look'd sickly with a poisonous green; A palsied silence deep, held nature dumb, As though the solemn day of death had come. Faint from the stars a drizzling light appears; Creation drooping, hangs her head in tears! Through towns, and villages, from tongue to tongue, The Hornet's triumph in bold anthem rung, Save at the east, where Discord hurl'd his brand, And scatter'd flames infernal through the land. Here, by mad Faction, Lawrence was declar'd To be a savage, with a heart more hard. But when at Washington, by Cooper sent, The flag was wav'd before the President, The aged statesman felt a glow the same, As though his son had conquer'd in his fame. Dallas, Monroe, and Hamilton, alone, He soughtâand brief his purposes made knownâ That Lawrence forth to Boston should repair To rule the Chesapeake in harbour there; And, that a sword of finest metal hard, Should be to him a token of regard. Glad they the voice of Madison approv'd, That he to loftier grade should be remov'd. With Cooper he despatch'd young Hamilton To bear his willâthe secretary's son, Whose name, alas, in future must appear To tax the soul the tribute of a tear. They leap'd their coursers with elastick spring, And flew the path like eagles on the wing. The lines of beauty fashion'd every limb, While light of heart, they seem'd in air to swim. Now on the morn, the sun was darkening seen To tinge the drooping earth with sallow green; They reach'd the cityâenter'd the abode Of Lawrence. Hamilton their coming show'd: âOcean's defender!âfrom the President, This sword, to you, with honour we present. âBiddle will now the Hornet ship commandâ Such is the change the government has plann'd: T' advance your name, to Boston you'll repair To rule the Chesapeake, in harbour there.â Lawrence, by valour prompted, forth replies: âBear back my heart to Madison the wiseâ Tell him that I, unpausing, shall obey; My country calls me, and my soul's away.â Hamilton stood fix'd in gaze immoveable, For deep his soul with sympathy was full. The noble sentiment, so prompt express'd, Touch'd his young heart with something that was bless'd, And while his eyes were flooded to the brim, Half heard he whisper'd: âO that I were him!â Lawrence observ'd the passion of his eye: âThy fame shall come, wait thou but patiently. Scarce in the race have I the start before; Make but the effort, and thy name shall soar. The round of life is like a tossing sea; This billow rises, that dissolves away; Another mounts its foaming brow to heaven; It fallsâits place is to another given. Our life is like a chain of different cloudsâ Various, successive, each the other crowds; Some are deep blacken'd with the tinge of nightâ Some touch'd exquisite with celestial light. Cherish thy heart with emulative blood, And thou wilt be a painted orient cloud, So richly tinctur'd with empyreal dye, To fix with gladdening gaze th' admiring eye. âBut mark how swift the moments whirl away? My duty calls the summons to obey; Back yours commands you to Potomack wave, To bear my answer, as to you I gave.â This said: The hand of Hamilton he press'd, Who slow departed with a crowded breast. The ocean chief, without delaying pause, Prepares once more to raise his country's cause, Whose voice was like the silver tongue of even, Calling the spirits of the bless'd to heaven. But who is this, that lingers by his side, Bath'd in her tears?âhis broken-hearted bride! With sighs, that heave like tearing of her breast, Clasping his hand, her anguish she express'd: âWherefore, my husband, wilt thou leave me here, To freeze my curdling blood with icy fear? Wilt thou again corrode my soul with grief? No heart but thine can minister relief! These eyes are never, never clos'd in sleep, When thou art tossing on the dangerous deep; But death's dark visions round my slumbers roam; I think thee struggling with wild ocean's foam; Now, I behold thee strangling in the flood; Now faint, I see thee pouring forth thy blood! âHow can I live, if you again depart, And leave me widow'd with a broken heart? O stay!âthou shalt not, must not leave me more, And cause my soul to weep, when ruffian billows roar!â Here poignant grief her stammering voice suppress'dâ And thus the hero with an aching breast: âThou worship of my soul!âfair beam of light! O lift thy soul from out this pit of night! Dispel these haunting visions of thy brain, More sharp they wound the breast than real pain. O cast this brood of phantoms from thy mindâ To heaven's high will be all our cares resign'd. âMy country calls me from thine arms away. Not voice angelick must my soul delay. How soon shall Iâ O stay that bitter tear! With reason chase these shadows of thy fear.â âYou never will return! We must not partâ That word is iceâit freezes to my heart! âYes, reason's voice should ever be our guide, And in the guardianship of heaven confide: But doth high heaven demand thine absence now? Or reason bid thee, where the oceans flow? Thy Country callsâbut she should ask no more, For thou hast done what ne'er was done before. Let others have their fame. O stay with meâ O seek not death upon the dark deep sea! âThough dreams are oft but wanderings of the mind And rare they leave a shadow'd truth behind, Yet O, last night, did I in dream behold Thy precious formâO how my blood runs cold! I saw thee wave thy swordâhow hard to tell!â A death-shot rung!âin blood my Lawrence fell!â âShuddering I woke,âthe gory vision fled; I caught thy smile in moonlight on the bed. Trembling with joy, that smiling lip I press'dâ But never more my senses tasted rest!â She ceas'd, half leaning on his anguish'd heart: âJulia, my life, this bosom breaks apart! Thou lamb-like innocence, thou light of loveâ Thy soul in softness is like heaven above; Thy voice to me is like an angel's tongue; Not sweeter musick can to heaven belong! Thy virtues pure, an holiness impart; Thine eye of beauty quivers in my heart! Thou art the unpric'd jewel of my soul; Thy charms, a paradise, around me roll! When near my breast, thou art my gazing star; When lock'd in fight, thou art my nerve in war! âThy meddling fancy hath destroy'd thy rest; Why, O why these sobs?âcheer with hope thy breast. Dreams are reverse of truthâyou thought me slain, While in the midst of battle on the main; Believe a second victory is mineâ The war-ship royal, buried in the brine. âThe dream thy fears produc'd: The busy mind Is bent to trace the thoughts, the day design'd; When sleep the action of the will subdues, Imagination wild her flight pursues; From reason loos'd, she flies eccentrick roundâ Mounts up to heaven, or visits depths profound. âBut O, if dreams give truth, then hear me tell A dream to make thy sinking bosom swell! âScarce had my senses clos'd upon the earth, When my rapt fancy usher'd into birth Scenes of strange likeness. Lo, methought I stood In a fair vessel, cleaving Salem's flood, Smooth-wafting me to shore. Her gorgeous dress Not the frail tongue of mortal can express. Her sails were woven silk,âmasts, ivory white, From which the streamers, playing with delight, Look'd like young clouds that hover in the west, Gazing the sun with rainbow on their breast. âThe bosom of the waters seem'd to live With silver barges, crowding to receive Thy husband, Julia, and make glad the ship, That mov'd a thing of wonder through the deep, Which look'd just melted with refining flameâ Purer than fancy can conceive to name. âLudlow was honour'd with me. Crowninshield, Of the proud bark, the first commission held. No vulgar mariners his voice obey'd, But twelve illustrious names of equal grade. âThe shores were sands of gold and diamonds bright, Which, in reflection, gave such splendid light, As though divinity were present there, While sweet-ton'd instruments were heard in air! âThousands stood gazing: As I touch'd the shore, Their tongues my triumph in proud anthems bore To listening Spirits on the wall of heaven, To whom the beauty of sublime was given! The bells peal'd merrily a silver note, Like angel harps when on new air they float. Then, the huge engines with their breaths of flame Sounded afar the glory of my name. âAnxious to clasp thy loveliness, I bade Salem brief adieu. In cavalcade They bore me forth,âand soon upon my way, I enter'd Boston in its bright array: From thence, with feelings past the uttering tongue, I came to York, to greet my infants young; And thou, the sweeter image of my breastâ And O, I found thee past description bless'd! âSuch is a faint revealing of my dream, That placid smile, which thou in moonlight beam Beheldst infantile playing on my cheek, Which naught but angels could descriptive speak! âThe cause was second vict'ry in the strife, Where sunk the foe exhausted of his life. âA parting kiss!âI tear me from thy heartâ Soon I return, and never more depart,â Farewell!âFarewell!!ââ She clung upon his breast: âMy husband!âno!â Stay,âstop,âO hear me! listen ere you go!â âThy ample reasoning hath dissolv'd my dreamsâ But nature, dumb in weeping sorrow, seems Portending death! The sun, eclips'd, slow moves With sallow light above the dark-green groves; The birds of night flit round,âdread horrour reignsâ Th' affrighted herds howl dismal o'er the plains!â Wild fancy thrill'd her frame. Lawrence replies, His heart like bursting with its agonies: âNo more, my love, these dire events forebode. Nature abides the government of God! He smilesâthe universe is bless'd with light; He frownsâthe world is buried in the grave of night! Man must pursue where virtue leads the way, And leave the rest to Him, who moulded human clay.â âThen be it so. If we indeed must part, I must resign, and still my aching heart. âBut O excuse,âexcuse my trembling soulâ These eyes of mine no more on thee will roll! I feel a deadly coldness in my breast, That I no more on this lov'd arm shall rest! âAh, see thy infants, how they reach their hands T' embrace their dying father as he stands! Feast on thy father, innocence divine,â And with thy mother's tears, O mingle thine! Alas, him more we never shall beholdâ His blood will streamâhis heart to dust will mould!â The hero weeps. His soul could bear no moreâ Sighs heave his bosom from its inmost core. He binds his wifeâhis children to his breast, And stands a speechless monument distress'd. At length, his voice returns:ââI cannot goâ Neverâno never in this depth of wo. My soul's eternal hopeâjoyâlife,âsole prideâ My all,âthy presence makes earth sanctified! O how forsake theeâand our dear ones too, Whose eyes beam heaven, pure wash'd with holy dew! Neverâno, neverâwillâI do remain; I'll never seek the ocean foe againâ âThe foe!â What ails my heart?âThe foeâthe foe! Hark! hear you not?âmy blood is ice,âmy bosom snow! âMy Country!âinjur'd Country!âmust I pause? Renounce thy glory for a private cause? âThink, O my fair one! think the widow's tears, And orphan cries, that pierce their suffering ears; The tyrant foe the cause!âoutlaw of earthâ Slaverâassassinâof Columbian birth! Behold, vindictive in dark swarms they come To shroud the land in horrour's deepest gloom! They'll fire our citiesâdesolate the fields; Their iron grasp will make our virgins yield! O, but to thinkâ 'Twill madden to proceedâ The gory thought makes every fibre bleed! âMust I remain to see thee in their power? O may the earth be melted ere that hour! My soul is on her pinionsâlet me flyâ Fly on the wings of death to meet the enemy!â âMy husband!âgoâI'll not detain theeâgo; I yield my all, for which I live below! Thy Country calls thee with imploring eyes, And I must make the bleeding sacrifice. This heart resigns thee for the nation's goodâ Guard, O ye Heavens! my Lawrence on the flood!â Her prayer was brief, but full. Silent he press'd Her sinking bosom to his throbbing breast; And, while his eye was bent upon her charms, He loosen'd from his heart her clasping arms. Her bosom labour'd with convulsive sighs; A shower of death came pouring from her eyes; Side long he linger'd on the aching viewâ At length, like parting life, he wav'd his last adieu. Meantime the Tyrant of the Stygian band Beheld the war, which blacken'd round the land Or by his agents, scouting far and wide, Notice receiv'd what pass'd upon the tide. With brewing passion hardening up his brow, He heard the manner of the Peacock low; His eyeballs rolling in red seas of fire, Reveal'd the mustering fury of his ire. With violence he stamp'd upon the rock; The mountain groan'd; earth trembled at the shock, As though a ball of thunder at a bound Had burst its cloud and broke upon the ground. His hidden train came forward at his nod, Their mouths in dust before their anger'd god. 'Twas deep eclipse when they the summons heardâ Their joints are hingeless at each threatening word: âWhy did you let the insect Hornet sting The royal Peacock, and her ruin bring? And could you not have loos'd a shipwreck wind, And her Starr'd banner to the deep consign'd? Or dash'd the sea in waves up mountains high, That they might sep'rate and the Peacock fly, Till We, Ourself the Hornet's sting withdrew, Ere that she battled with the Albion crew? âWhat mads and foams like lava, in Our breast, Is, that this Lawrence succour'd the distress'd: We fear Britannia will compunction feel, And cease to murder with the scourge and steel. Should she relent, Our labour would be vain To bind Columbia with a monarch's chain. Should she with mercy soothe away her ire, A peace would fatal to our cause transpire. âIn hell, 'tis true, of war We disapprov'd, For then, We fear'd their feuds would be remov'd. Civil commotions war has ever quell'd, And rankling bosoms for their country mail'd: But this Republick an exception forms; More dark the war, more dire fierce Discord storms: Hence, We (as war proves well,) to keep alive Th' inflaming torch, must all Our art contrive. âWhen Hull, through Treason's wiles, gave Brock the west, Hope took the full possession of Our breast; But this defeat has dash'd Our prospects low, Which then were rising to an overflow; Frenzied divisions, like a wild fire, spread, Which promis'd soon to sweep their Freedom dead. âHypocrisy, arise and brief relate, What thou hast glean'd, to sink, or elevate.â Though cramp'd with age, Hypocrisy up-rear'd His wrinkled brow and heavy-flowing beard. His wither'd hands were folded on his breast, Outward to show his bosom was at rest; The sign is falseâan inward sting he feels Deep through his life, which his red eye reveals. The specious shows, to cover o'er his heart, Sharpen more keen the conscience-piercing dart. With knee on earth, half smile upon his cheek, The fawning sycophant began to speak: âDread Sire supreme, before whose awful nod Earth trembling owns the presence of a god! Not I can see the danger you express, Our cause is waning into emptiness; Firmer am I encourag'd to believe, That we'll division of the States achieve, For in the senate of our chosen State, Disguis'd, I sat and heard them in debate: This war they crucified, as nothing justâ That, from his seat, the President they'd thrust; That Lawrence murder'd in the coldest blood, When he the Peacock buried in the flood! That they'd support Britannia and her causeâ Revile the nation and the nation's laws. âOur strength accession gains each passing day; Soon, without limit, will extend our sway; By me establish'dâguided by my hand, In close design, I've leagued a desperate band, To which the name of Washington is given, And fair Benevolenceâa nymph of heaven, By which our motives with a veil is hid, As you in Paradise at Eden did, When in a serpent likeness you deceiv'd The woman's ear, till you her death achiev'd. âHere great and small of every tribe come forth To form their plans and bring them into birth. The wise and unwise, needy, weak, and strong, Practise to wag with a reviling tongue. âTo feed their vanity, to each a rose I gave: to sway their minds with titled shows, And make them feel distinction from our foes; But we from enemies have naught to dread, Except Fredonia should their weakness aid.â Starting, the Fiend with inward terrour shook, When the bright Agency of heaven was spoke; His colour chang'd from black to green, and blue, As though transfix'd with arrowy lightning through. But soon the pang wore off: âDastard, shall I Tremble to mark her passing from the sky? Admit she comes with all her glittering train, Will she have influence on the earth again? Not heaven combin'd! Our chain is on their necks, Which nothing from the forge of thunder breaks! And was she not by gilded Luxury driven Back to her native element of heaven? And was not this, whilst We in hell remain'd? And can We not secure the hearts We've gain'd? She dares not meet Our potency!âshe fears, That We'd despatch her to the nether spheres.â He paus'd. His subjects from their kneeling stood, And smil'd upon their king in such a mood, That the sun darkening, shrunk behind the moon, And heaven was midnight at the hour of noon! The Fiend proceeds: âWhat tho' Our royal blood, Of late, was ruffled in an angry mood; The feat of Lawrence struck Us with alarmâ But prospects brighten, and Our heart moves calm. âRibands and roses are the sweetest things To introduce the grade of Earls and Kings; Your Honour, and Your Excellencyâthe terms, From which fair fruit will springâimperial germs! Titles in infancy, to grow at length To splendid Royalty of manhood strength. Flatter their vanity; keep up the cheat; We shall ere long become exceeding great. âBut now attend, whilst We, Our plan make known To bow this Lawrence to the Albion Throne: âHe, for the sinking of the Peacock, late, Commands a vessel of superior weight, The Chesapeake, return'd with broken crewâ None yet receiv'd the measure of their due. To make her number full, from land a crowd Ignorant of helm, of compass, sail, or shroud, Have enter'd for the sea,âunpractis'd yet:â By these and other causes, We'll defeat And Barronize her flag. Success is Oursâ A Nelson victory will renown Our powers. âIn Boston rides the ship. The Shannon near, Is ready to contest the strife severe; Brook, her chief mariner, like fearless Peak, Is shivering in his heart the war to seek; And, like the Peacock, will the Shannon sink, Unless We aid to break the Freedom link. âVengeance! arise!âand to the Shannon forth, While in eclipse the sun is veil'd from earth; There spread your influence like a poisonous breeze; Each drop of mercy in their bosoms freeze, Or they'll remember Lawrence sav'd his foe, And cease to murder, when his flag is low. âMutiny! to gain the Chesapeake, is thine, And see you there accomplish Our design, T' unnerve her strength before in fray they meetâ And bring the Eagle fluttering at Our feet.â His mandate given,âhe wields his sceptre roundâ And straight his subjects vanish'd from the ground. Them slow he follow'd in a silent mood, His eyeballs swimming in a tide of blood. Vengeance and Mutiny, on sable wing, Leap in the airâand round about them fling The folds of night. Their course, to ocean's flood, Resembled meteors in a mist of blood; 'Twas at the moment that the earth was hid, And all the living of the earth seem'd dead! When Lawrence sad departed from his bride, He sought the Chesapeake on Boston's tide, Late from a distant voyage:âAnd, as the sun His third bright journey through the heavens begun, He gain'd the city; to the ship repair'd To do such deeds as valiant bosoms dar'd. Ludlow and Weaver, Abbot, Nichols, Whiteâ And Berry, Evansâfor their fame unite. Budd, Livingston, and Ballard, Hopewell, Brown, In holy league to brighten in renownâ Bloom, in his spring-time yearsâand Livermoreâ His God was firstâand next his native shore: These are the names to navigate the ship, And wake her slumbering thunders on the deep. The Shannon now, off Boston bears in sightâ Prepar'd and practis'd ready for the fight. Her Lion Cross, suspended in the air, Invites the Chesapeake to meet her thereâ This flames the breast of Lawrence with a fire, That glows, and burns, till blazes his desire To bow her haughty standard, or expire. Warm flush'd his cheek; his heart an holy throb Beat; thrill'd emotion glanc'd his vision'd orb: As when a miser, with an iron soul, Strips his dependant naked of his wholeâ Yet, still unsatisfied: cries âGive!âgive!âgive! Or he with crime in dungeon damp shall live!â The debtor pleads the sorrows of a wife And children; destitute of means of life; Nothing availsâhe drags him to the goal, And deep in prison fastens up his soul! The chill, damp dungeon weeps with pity more, Than ever touch'd the monster's heart of gore. Cold on a sweating stone his head reclines, While his pale flesh with eating anguish pines; But should he chance to doze, he dreams he hears His children cry for breadâhis wife in tears! He startsâawakens with delirious head, Hating his being,âpraying to be dead: Behold, some Howard enters with a smile, Fair as the bow of peace, to reconcile Mortal to Deityâand forth proclaims, That Mercy from his sepulchre redeems! He thinks an angel sudden dropp'd from heaven, Such rush of transport to his soul is given: Not a less joy thrill'd Lawrence to descry The royal banner floating in the sky. With bosom beating, and his eye like day, He gave the word for sailing:ââAnchors! weigh! Behold, the Cross imperial flouts the sphere! Enchafe the veins of life, till stars appear; Yea, lift the soul with such emotions high, That stars shall seem to sparkle from the eye! What heart, that palpitates with Freedom's tide, Can mark you Albion, boasting in her pride, And not within his bosom feel a flame To meet her there, and die,âor scath her name? Noneânone, that ever felt what Freedom is, Or knew, that liberty of mind was his. âRise! mount the steep of heaven! rise, oneârise, all! Looseâbreak the fetters, that your souls enthral! Let Independence and the sailor's right, Burn on the heart to prompt us to the fight. Lo, should we dash you standard from the sea, This day, hereafter, would be jubilee! âThe anchors elevate! Be menâbe oneâ Be but resolv'd, the conquest shall be won!â Touch'd with his spirit's fire, the patriot crew Felt every feeling of their passion new, Save him, who pipes the mariners The Boatswain.âwhose eye Sneer'd as he turn'd, which show'd his enmity. The seamen presently the anchors raise, Intent to meet the foe upon the seas. But sad and slow the vessel movesâthe sails Are scarce expanded by the sorrowing gales. Lo, as her flag divides the clouds in heaven, A coffin blackness to their folds is given! The shores behold her in deep silence bent, As dull she travels through her element. Conflicting passions reel in every breast; Now, buoy'd with hope, and now, by fear depress'd: âO Thou, Who sway'st the ocean!â thus they breathe, âOnce more the laurel round his temples wreathe; Vouchafe to shield him when the lightnings burnâ And O, the hero to our arms return!â But heaven deign'd not to listen to their prayer; 'Twas lost like desert sweetness on the air. The meanwhile, Mutiny was bent to find A plan best suited to effect his mind,â He saw the boatswain's heart from union riven, And all his soul to deep temptation given. Soft he approach'd him, cover'd in a mist, His hellish deed the better to assist,â When secret he was crouch'd behind a mask, To pour a reeling portion from his flask To mad his brainsâ(O, cursed be that night, When some hell-fury brought the art to light To melt the harvest to empoisoning fume; To bury men while breathing, in the tomb!) While thus he drew it forth,âin covert hid; (His passion such, he'd drink it from the head The grave cast up!)âthe fiend, with purpose fell, Pour'd a strong dropâthe strongest drop of hell, Into the draught, hot hissing from his veinâ To work the working of Columbia's bane. The tempted drank it!âSoon it fir'd his bloodâ He mutter'd to himself in frenzied mood. Nor was his tongue alone diseas'd; his brain, His heart, each fibre, every secret vein. Words came at length, but softâscarce heard aloudâ But soon they drew th' attention of the crowd: âAnd who is this, with scorn upon his brow, To whose behest or tyranny we bow? So long has he on fulsome praise been fed, He steps above us with imperious tread. Rumour reports, he stung the Peacock's life With such superior judgment in the strife, As to excel all battles on the deep, Since the first action of a fighting ship. 'Twould pride me well to learn of such a man. 'Tis airâlight air!âThe compass of a span Would overreach his mind. He may have blood To act a madman's gestures on the flood, But not the courage to attack a foe, Cool and deliberateâpointed every blow. âAdmit the Peacock ended, as report Stated the featâ'twas not the mind's effort, That gave her up to deathâbut chance, mere chanceâ 'Tis strange he's lauded for this circumstanceâ A very nothingâfeat of ignorance! âWhat skill of naval judgment now, I pray, Does he in sailing from the port display, To meet with yonder Briton in the strife, Where we are doom'd to render up our life? A better ship through ocean never ran, More than suppliedâand chosen, every man; A ship that never yielded to a foeâ Never in harbour bent her colours low! But this dark vessel has been fir'd upon, And that, without her answering of a gun! Her hateful colours Barron order'd down, And bent her kneeling to the British crown! âYea, Heaven's against us! was not the sun Muffled in death-robes at the time of noon? Did not, without a cause, the main-brace stay, At the same hour, with solemn sounds give way? And were there not strange noises in the night, Like dying groans, upon the fore-top height? And did not three of us, distinct behold A pallid ghost, in bloody garments roll'd!! âWho, with such omens, would pretend to go To wage the battle with an abler foe? None but a madmanânone would leave the strand, Except a Lawrence held the ship's command. âBesides, ere this, our dues should be receiv'dâ Yes, ere the anchor from its bed be heav'd! Let braggarts boast of being brave and true, But I'll no effort till I have my due! My country has my love, but self much moreâ Without arrears, by me no gun shall rear. âWhat means this tyrant?âwhat!âto stand for all? Resist the enemy?âin battle fallâ While nothing have we left for childrenâwives? No man can bear it, not a man that lives! By me, no ball shall at the foe be driven, Till full arrearage for the past be given! âNo doubt the President has plac'd it hereâ Yea, and full soon, 'twill manifest appear, That Lawrence keeps it in his coffers hid, And with close lock secures the iron lid, That we, his valiant but his subject crew May beg for that which is our lawful due: Crouch to his footstoolâlap his spittle up, And drink the meanest dregs of slavery's cup! âEre this would I, I'd render up my breath, Sink down to hellâendure a felon's death!â His voice commenc'd in whisperâbut at close, His words came faster, and his accents rose. At first one listen'dâthen another stood; A third assented that his words were good; Soon, numbers hearken'd to his poisoning tongue, Rank with the venom of the fury strung: Like this, a swain, to clear his stubble land, Touches the chaff with an exciting brand; A single blade first catches with the flame; Another flashes into life the same: Another, and another, and another glows, And soon a circle of small compass shows, From which the infant fire with lameness creeps; At length enrag'd, it desolating sweeps The arid field. The winds from slumber rise, And cast the fragments burning to the skies: Thus Mut'ny spreads disaster through the ship, As slow she cleaves the bosom of the deep; The flooding tide was pouring in ahead, To stay her progress from the conflict dread. While thus upon the earth:âthe Bless'd above, With golden tires assembled in the grove; Fredonia rising, the deep silence brokeâ Th' empyreals pondering every word she spoke: âSynod of saintsâillustrious host of heaven! To whom the breath of Deity is given! Since last the seraph call'd us to this bower, I've mark'd the sadness of Columbia's power. âBehold, the Stygian monarch, far and wide The nation traverses, with bosom stride. On Hampshire's cliffs, conceal'd from every eye, He holds dark conclave with his agency; Wide through the land they drive pale death severe; Dismay and terrour flaming on their rear. Deep-plotting Treason, Cowardice conjoin'd; The army west to royalty resign'd; The savage hordes in gather'd clouds come forth To riot in the blood of infant birth! âSuch the disaster of the banded powers; But on the ocean proud, the Eagle towers. Porter bears high his standard on the wave; The Lion shuns, or crouches to the brave. Not Lawrence need I nameâmy chosen son, Who late a laurel in his glory won, Eclipsing history's pageâon the same even, Hart, Boyd, and Williams bore the news to heaven. Nor dwell upon his worthâhis foes speak this, By kind indulgence in their wretchedness. âBut OâAlas! 'twas in thy native town, Franklin, they strove to crush the hero down; Revil'd and stamp'd him with the stain of blood, That he in battle should the foe inflood! Pronounc'd anathemas of deepest dye Against the manâthe favourite of the sky! âNow, he guides forth the Chesapeake to sea, A ship bestain'd with unwash'd infamy, To meet the Shannonâboast of royal power, Of all that waves the Albion Cross the flower. I fear the issueâfor, behold I saw Two fiends in league to aid the Shannon's war; Vengeance and Mutinyâthe worst of forms, That measure earth, or ride upon the storms.â She ended with a sigh. And Franklin rose With brow unalter'dâsuch as wisdom shows: âSuch is the feebleness of man below, That few a blessing in possession know; But when withdrawn, he pines in grief full sore For that he priz'd as worthless dross before. That his revilers sharp may feel remorse, And weep in anguish for their outrag'd course, Bring Lawrence here, with every virtue bless'd, To bask in sunbeams of eternal rest.â Scarce had he finish'd, when consent was given To call him from the earth, to feast on joys in heaven. What time they thus in holiness above, In sight the Chesapeake of Shannon hove; For heretofore, an intervening isle Eclips'd the view, save top-masts, flags, and sail. Lawrence for battle congregates his crew, And once again invokes them to be true; For he some partial whisperings had heard, That discontent in many a bosom stirr'd: âLook, and behold the enemy in sight! Now let each mariner contend his right! Inflame the streams of life!âtight strain each nerve! The lofty plaudits of the brave deserve. Prove to the world our energies are strong, When Justice arms to vindicate our wrong. Our trust is heav'n, that we the fight shall gain, Or, that deniedâwe fall like martyrs, slain; For who would deign to live, our banner down; The vessel hail'd in triumph to the crown? Ourselves in chainsâyeaâspit uponârevil'dâ Far from our country and our friends exil'd! In dungeon dampnessâ Hold! My bosom swells Beyond the thought of life! What hero dwells, Hearing my voice, but that his heart with me, Would rather break its prison and be free! Noneânoneânot one!âThe Stars that gild the mast, Shall shine, as heaven, unclouded till the last! Yea, ere their beams shall fade, we'll yield our breath, And for our Country die a living death; Yea, fame eternal is the deathless meed To those who, righteous, for their freedom bleed! âLet nothing doubt we conquer in the fight, If soul, if heart in brotherhood unite; Be but resolv'd to triumph or to die, Then will our banner wave in victory!â A pause ensu'd the moment he had done; A sullen murmuring through the vessel run; The deepening whispers buzz'd from man to man; At length, the voice of mutiny began: âMy pride is in my flag: But how can we Put forth in war our hearts' full energy, While sad our children cry for means to live; And tears, for bread, our wives for answer give! Were we not hurried hence without our pay, With food scarce equal for the present day? Ah, who can fight with valour on the deep, While all that feeds the soul, with hunger weep!â Lawrence with anguish mark'd the treacherous flame, And scarce had power to keep his passion tame; He glanc'd his sword, to snatch upon the steel, To make the mutineer its sharpness feel: But reason cameâhis sudden heat allay'dâ The brief, mad motion of his arm she stay'd. He views the strength of the seditious power; The brewing fight impending on the hour; And saw the time would suffer no delay To curb, with trial, those who led astray; Hence, he his soul inclin'd to milder viewsâ And sign'd the whole an order for their dues. So a fond parent, with a wayward child, First tries th' effect of lenient reason mild; Nor treats the young offence with rod severe, But bathes the foible with forgiving tear. Having commission for their toils receiv'd, A righteous number for their conduct griev'd. And now the hero, with a starting tear, Besought his crew their country to revere: âLet the past cloud be vanish'd from our sightâ Melted and lost in patriotick light! Let all our minor enmities expire Before the torch of Freedom's holy fire! âShould we in battle render up our lives, Our grateful country will revere our wives; Our orphans, left upon her breast behind, Will the soft nurture of a parent find. âNow to his place each mariner repair, For lo, in distance of the foe we bear; Swearâkneel to heaven, the victory to gain, Or find a death eternal, in the main! Let no dark spot becloud the crystal mindâ Let the soul reach to something that's refin'd!â Choice numbers heard, and every feeling shar'd, And to their stations with proud hearts repair'd; Some to the gunsâsome nimble in the air, Climb to the tops to fight the Britons there. Lawrence reclines upon the staff of hope, That now the boatswain's mutiny would stop; But ah, that staff is nothing but a reed To break, and fall, and cause the land to bleed; For still the poison lurks within his soulâ No generous action could his hell control. The fame of Lawrence stings his silk-worm'd heart Severe and deep with envy's venom'd dartâ His towering virtuesâhis majestick height, Are basilisk poison to his rancorous sight. With dark malignity his passions swellâ Hot in his bosom burns the fire of hell: Thus, when the raving of unsparing flame Riots in cities long renown'd in fame, The feeble streams that sprinkle on the fire But mount the blaze above the loftiest spire: So Lawrence's virtues but augment his wrathâ He spreads his poison in a secret path. When th' Shannon saw the Chesapeake in sight, She made to sea to gain a roomy fight; And as the vessel through the ocean press'd, Brook to his crew a hero's soul express'd: âBehold the Eagle-battle-ship bears down! Now prove the ancient valour of the crown! The victory is ours!âBehold, in night, Nelson the great appear'd before my sight, And spoke the words of joy!ââCast back thy fearâ Lo I, invisible, will hover near, And give the Shannon fame!ââ Our admiral now, Is standing o'er us with approving brow! Let every Briton in his voice confideâ Methinks I see him on the waters ride! âImmortal Spirit! come! make strong our hands, And steel our heartsâwhose genius none withstands! Thine energies impart!âlet none defile Thy glories brilliant, of Trafalgar, Nile! Let none the Lion 'neath the Eagle cowerâ Give us thy conquering arm to vindicate thy power! âMethinks I feel him quicken in my soul! Shrink not, ye Britons, when the flames shall roll? Do not your bosoms throb with impulse strong, To hear the rough note jarring from the tongue Of bellowing War?âThen, scorn the ship to flyâ Involve the sea in fire,âlet thunders break the sky!â Like the quick thrill, produc'd by Franklin fires, The name of Nelson every nerve inspires; The ship no longer on the ocean fliesâ Each Briton touch'd with former victories. Meantime the Chesapeake was moving slow, Deep sunk in ocean freighted with her wo. Proud in the Shannon thoughts of conquest swell, While in the Chesapeake the work of hell. And now th' inferior sails of each are furl'd, Ready to strike the other from the world; Like threat'ning spirits on the wave they move, When scowling tempests darken heaven above. Brook waves the signal!âLoud the Shannon roarsâ Lawrence in answer, full a broadside pours; The Briton presently returns the blow, Which strikes a patriot with a death-wound low. White, science-taught, was master of the sail, To spread them open when the breezes fail; Or, when they whistled with an impulse brief, Them to make short with a contracting reef; Or, when the vessel sail'd aside the wind, To bend them quartering with a skilful mind:â This was his pride; and well could he perform Th' important art, in temp'rate, or in storm. Now, as the second peal from Shannon rung: âTake in the fore-top!â echoed from his tongue; âThe gib-sheets reef, lads, reef! the halyards clear! The mizzen topââ A bullet graz'd his ear, And broke the jaw, as looking up he stoodâ He fell without a struggle in his blood! His heart a moment quiver'd with its flame, Then beat no more, and cold with death became. A ball, the same time, struck the centre mast, And leap'd at Lawrence, as oblique it past, And tore the muscles of his dexter thigh, But not unalter'd was the hero's eye. The wound was quite forgotten in his fame: âKindle the mind!âAnother broadside, flame!â Scarce had the mandate from his bosom broke, When like the elements the cannon spoke, Which laid the enemy thick strown with deadâ But Brook return'd an equal slaughter dread. Ballard, of tender years, and generous Broom, Found by one death-shot an expiring doom. Breast touching breast they bleed,âgrasp'd hand in hand A lovely pair, long bound in friendship's hand. Their dying eyes speak all the tender soul!â Two tears half form'd, in either eyelid roll; But ere the drops are rounded to the full, Death preys on life, and makes their silver dull. Their Spirits freed, the steep of heaven they climb, From star to star to reach their home sublime. Thus two fair lilies, in their love sincere, Bloom'd for each other in the spring-time year; Each yielding each the essence pure of bliss, Their lips saluting tender with a kiss: While thus they flourish'dâwedded side to side, A worm consum'd their rootâembrac'd in death, they died. So liv'd, so flourish'd youthful Ballard, Broom, Nor broke their holy friendship in the tomb. As near, more near, the vessels edge in fight, Fierce, and more fierce they kindle in their spite. Swift from the Shannon's top a bullet flew, And pierc'd the arm of Lawrence burning through; Fainting he reels! but 'gainst the cabin way, He leaning, saves his fall; maintains the fray! Though his rich blood flows copious from each wound, He smiles unalter'd, in the strife profound! When Ludlow mark'd his second life-stream flow, He sprang and urg'd him to retire below: âLawrence! O let me press you to withdraw, And seek a moment's respite from this war, Till these unsightly wounds are staunch'd of blood; Doubt not, till death, my efforts on the flood. Though thy proud bearing may disdain the thoughtâ But mortal sinew of frail clay was wrought; Thy spirit may be strong, but flesh is weakâ I mark it waning in thy fading cheek!â The bleeding Lawrence grasp'd him by the hand: âIf mortal man could sway me from command, O Ludlow! thou art heââ Death stinging came And wounded Ludlow, as he spoke his name. The cruel messenger his stomach pastâ But Lawrence held him to his bosom fast; The last faint flutter of his heart he bore, Then eas'd him down, all shrouded in his gore! The big tear trembled on the hero's cheek: âMy death is bliss!âno other did I seek!â A moment he reviv'dâthen stretch'd his limbs; The film of darkness o'er his vision swims; Thickening it settles deep upon his sight, Shrouding his being with the pall of night. Lawrence recovers of his weeping eye, For now the battle kindles to the sky; He braves the storm in blood. Deep thunders roll, Which seem to echo to the distant pole. As when two isles of ice, in Arctick deep, Rear their bleak heads to heaven's high vaulted steep; Their base a thousand fathoms sunk beneath, Where sea-bred monsters search for shipwreck'd death. The storm, descending on the main at length, Rouse the full ocean to its foaming strength; Each rolls on each, with crushing horrour drivenâ The shock tremendous seems creation riven; The huge leviathans in caverns roar; Th' affrighted sea shrinks backward to the shore. Like this the vessels in their rage contendâ The arch of heaven their solid thunders rend; Black clouds of sulphur wrap the ocean round; Bolts, wing'd with fire, convulse at every sound; The sea, deep changing to a purple flood, Grows warm and smoking with the waste of blood. In dread suspense the fight was long maintain'd, At length the Chesapeake the advantage gain'd: Her iron globes the Shannon's bulwarks bor'dâ And still, unsparing, through her life they pour'd; The drowning deep rush'd in! To wear she strove, So vast the ruins through her vitals drove. Lawrence (though pale his cheek, his eye like fire Bright flash'd his soul,) proclaims his heart's desire: âBehold, she reelsâshe fails! Range, range ahead! Assail her bows and strike her with the dead! Break through her ribs of life! Let nothing lagâ A moment, and behold she strikes her flag! Runârun upon her prow! She bears awayâ Rejoice with dying, and we gain the day! Think not of living, when to die is gainâ He lives eternal who in fight is slain!â While this was utter'd, Lawrence seem'd a ghost, So pale his cheekâhis colour all was lost, Save where in spots, the gore had made a stain, As though he'd quicken'd after he was slain! The strangeness of his look touch'd every heartâ Yea, e'en the mutineer was chang'd in part! At once with wings of fire, the vessel wears, And round upon the bow of Shannon bears; The Albion standard totters to a fall; Her decks are made a slaughter'd funeral. At this bright instant, on bleak Hampshire far, The Fiend, deep-cavern'd, felt the shock of war. Alarm'd lest hell itself might feel decay, He came in folded mist, conceal'd from day; And, as he pass'd, he snatch'd a mountain spur, Which made the earth through all her entrails stir. His scowl was like a thunder-cloud in storm, Brewing its wrath creation to deform. He breaks his sweating passion: âWhat, must We, In every conflict, save them from the sea? Is this an infant race? No time to waitâ The Shannon sinks beneath the battle's weight!â This having said, he hurl'd the ruin down, Which seem'd a desperate effort of the crown: As when a mountain by an earthquake moves With all its castle rocks, and streams, and groves; At first it reels, then, plunging with a bound, Buries whole cities in its waste profound: Like this the weight upon the vessel fell, Which in the ocean caus'd a shipwreck swell. Her masts, her tackle,âall her sheets are tornâ The brave stand panick with their hopes forlorn. A cold despair their sinking hearts o'erwhelm; The ship no longer answers to the helm. She swings her bow and takes the wind aback, And staggering reels upon the Shannon's track. Her left bow anchor fixes in her stern; And now the Albion gives her death in turn! âBoard! Board! my heroes?â Lawrence spoke with fire. The valiant rose to conquer, or expire. His spirit, like a deity, reviv'd Their palsied hearts, which thrilling life receiv'd. His wounds were disregarded in his mindâ Forward he rush'd to lead the bold inclin'd; His circling brand cast forth unusual light, And flash'd severe upon a Briton's sight, High in the mizzen topâwho strove to bear The lead upon his breast, but lo, the glare, Reflected from the falchion, dimm'd his eye Like lightning arrows glancing from the sky. At length, his brow contracting, dull'd the light, And gave his bosom partial to the sight; At glance he aim'd the instrument of death; The ruin pass'd his noble heart beneath! Budd sprang and caught the hero on his breast, His soul in speechless agony distress'd: But Lawrence rous'd him with his fading lipâ âBoard! Board! my heart! And Don't give up the Ship!â He faints. Young Hopewell, and the tender Brown, Bear him with sorrow to a couch of down; Sad they resign him to the surgeon's care, And swift return to aid the pressing war. Evans and Livingston, as Lawrence fell, Sunk in their blood and bade the world farewell. They scorn'd their lives, when they the hero saw Fainting to death, and from the deck withdraw. A reeking pike was driven through the first; An unknown lead struck Livingston to dust. As Hopewell eager from the cabin rose To urge despairing conflict with his foes, A torn-off splinter from the quarter flew, And caus'd a blindness of his eyebeams blue! He falls, he gasps, where Lawrence's blood was shed; With brow in smiles, he slumbers with the dead! When Lawrence fainted, Budd wav'd high his sword, And echo'd with a tear his parting word: âCarve with the falchion deepâand rush along, And do the order of his dying tongue! Behold, the crazy Shannon sinks! she fails! A moment, and her trembling standard quails! Put forth the soul! nor let th' occasion slipâ Board! Board! my hearts! And Don't give up the Ship!â Full as he clos'd, he flash'd in air his brand T' invade the Shannon with a chosen band, Determin'd never, never to return While a brief flicker of life's flame should burn. But in the act, upon the foe to thrust, A spark inflam'd a canister of dust, Which dash'd him on the deck. Midst flame he rose, So eager in his mind with death to close. But his division, drove disorder'd backâ Benumb'd their efforts from the bold attack. Brook saw th' advantage, and with boldness cried: âLeap into Freedom, and escape the tide! See, how the Shannon settles in the main! The sands are few, that we can here maintain! No chance of life, save boarding them from ours, And gain possession of Columbian powers! Scarce he the speech had finish'd from his tongue, When he with fifty on the vessel sprung. Sudden a thought glanc'd Budd: âHaul the fore tack! And shoot the Chesapeake from Albion's wreck! Lo, Brook is ours, divided from his crew! Give the soul's effort!âwe the foe subdue!â A chosen number make the bold assay To free their anchor from the stern away. The poize of vict'ry on the act depends; The anchor loos'd, the scale to Budd descends. The boatswain now in his defiance stood, And thus address'd the disaffected crowd, Standing at distance, reckless to descry The ship resigning to the enemy! âWhat means it all? May I be hurl'd to death, Yea, fry in hottest flames with fiends beneath, If ship to disengage, I move a hand, Or raise a finger at his mad command! And those I deem as idiots, who remain To toil and fight, and in their blood be slain! What, cringe to all? To Budd must rule be given? Is he supreme? I heed him not, by heaven!â As when th' Infernal, in his pride on high, His bosom swell'd with rancorous enmity, Harangu'd the envious to unite in one, And cast th' Eternal backward from his throne; Two thirds, apostate from their brightness fell, And follow'd north, the monarchy of hell: So, when this felon his defiance spoke, Two thirds in scorn, the valiant deed forsook! Budd stood a gelid spirit on the ship, As though late risen from the blood-stain'd deep; His large dark eyes were fill'd with anger's glare; But soon that passion yielded to despair; Frenzy returning, forth his soul was storm; Then pallid grief o'ershades his noble form. Thus a huge billow of a troubled sea, With chafing heaves its foaming head to day; Then sinks as deep within the ocean vast,â But, soon excited by the driving blast, Ascends with rage above the stormy rack; As soon it settles to the centre back; Again it tosses to the scowling heaven; Again to caverns of the ocean driven. So whirling passions his heart's centre tore, His bosom sweating with large drops of gore. Lo, while he stood thus tortur'd in his mind, A fiery lead came whistling through the wind, And graz'd his skull! Insensible, a stone, He fell, without th' utterance of a groan; Oblivion veil'd his senses from the past, And hid th' affliction that the ship o'ercast. The Britons now gain footing on the deck, By strong divisions rushing from the wreck; Yet are the free not conquer'd! still they wound, And blood they scatter in profusion round. Brook now and Livermore meet eye to eye; They stand, brow scowling, ere they close to die: Thus when a tiger, passing by a stream, Beholds the eyeballs of a lion gleam, Each glares in silence, kindling in his ire; Then rush they forth the other to expire: So stood they pausing with their arms up-rais'd, While their fix'd eyes like midnight meteors blaze. The messenger divine, The Chaplain. his death advanc'd, And quick the shining of the silver glanc'd; By the swell'd wind-pipe, swift the globule flies, Near where the vital artery throbbing lies. Brook's falchion at the instant gleam'd in airâ It strikes!âmixes the brains with tangled hair. The brand is buried in the hero's neckâ Both fall in blood upon the gory deck! Righteous thy feet, brave Livermore! have trod The path of virtueâminister of God! Now thou hast found the longing of thy soul, Freed from this earth where troublous oceans roll. Not thou for form did'st wear the robes of heaven; But to thy country were thy efforts given. Thus by example, as by precept fair, Thou taught'st thy brothers in the war to dare; And not with sanctity, at home to feed On the fat earth, while others toil and bleed! For this thy virtue, O that I were strong To give thy name its merit in my song! But thou hast fled beyond the sphere of earth, And, ripe for heaven, receiv'd its wonderous birth! Hence, all the poet's rhapsodies are vain T' entice thine ear to hearken to his strain; Yet, O accept th' emotions of my soulâ They fly to greet thee from the earth's control! From age to age will sound thy spotless fame; Nor cease, till Nature shall forget her name! During the conflict, Vengeance for the crown Watch'd his fell chance to crush the helpless down; And now, while Brook in swoon half dying lay, Whose virtues aw'd him from the strife away; Watt he approach'd, (the form of Nelson took,) Half viewless in the folds of heaving smokeâ And to inflame his heart to murder, spoke: âThink not that I my character made great, By sparing those who sunk beneath my weight; You by my voice, Caracciola hung, For which, in anthem strains, my name is sung; Brandish your dirk! Seek vengeance for the deed Of those who cause our heart's best veins to bleed.â (Watt of the Shannon was the next to Brook,) And scarce the fury had his purpose spoke; When dire he scowl'd a massacreing look: Like when an image from the grave comes forth In half moon darkness to affright the earth! Deeds of rank murder agitate his soul; His eyes start from his head,âhell flames they roll; A dagger, dipp'd in blood, he wields in air; With fire electrick, flashes every hair. Foaming he grinds his teeth,âholding his breath; His rear is follow'd by the stride of death! The monster butchers with unsparing knife The wounded Patriots, pleading for their life. A weeping widow some, and some a sire; Some helpless orphans, should they dark expire: The adder heard notâmad he onward strode O'er shivering death and smoking scenes of blood! Berry advanc'd in all his peerless bloom, And though his face was touch'd with sorrow's gloom, He look'd a rainbow on a cloud at even, When all the elements are mix'd in heaven: âO stay the murder of thy blood-soak'd hand! Art thou of Britain? that once boasted land, Which, to the bruis'd in battle, pour'd a balm, Mix'd with a tear, that made his sorrows calm? I pray you listen! prove thyself a manââ âProve death!â (he cried,) and seiz'd him in his span, Drove deep the dagger thrice upon his heart; And, as he fell, he ripp'd his breast apart! While thus the wretchâBudd waken'd from his trance, And snatch'd at hand the hilt of bloody lance, And tore an opening for his life to stream; His entrails follow'd with a dying scream, Like that which echoes from the gallows plain, When midnight darkness hides the shrieking slain. The vessel shudder'd as the monster fell; Grim Vengeance seiz'd his soul and bore it down to hell. The strife is done:âno strength to strike a blowâ The Cross floats highâthe Stars are seen below! Alas, the blinding sight! Thou bleeding Bark! Thy course hath been a cloud of midnight dark. Yea, thou hast been a stain upon the earthâ Dishonour mark'd thee at thy hated birth! Weep not, Columbia! Let her name be doneâ And every thought upon her flag begone; But O, indulge thy weeping for the blood, Bathing her waistâcold curdling in the flood! O sweet, like dropping balm, the falling tear, That speaks the soul, when virtue loads the bier! The Fiend, rejoicing, to the mountain hied, As though the name of Liberty had died. The mortal wound of Lawrence pleas'd his soul, That Britain still the ocean would control. The time the battle with success appear'd, The dying Lawrence his attendants cheer'd, For then he grappled with the power of death, Respiring full and stronger with his breath: But when the Albion shouts for victory roar'd, He sprang with wildness: âCarry me on board! Ludlow, leap forward to the anchor there! What shout is that?ââ He sunk with death's despair! But at the moment of departing life, Clasping his arms: âMy children, O my wife!â Now when the synod in the bower of heaven, Prejudg'd that death to Lawrence should be given, That through the portal he might enter life, Freed from the turmoil of impassion'd strife,â Fredonia stood upon the diamond wall To watch the period of his dying fall. Soon as she saw him in death's cold embrace, She shot from heaven, more rapid than the race Of melted beams, descending clear at noon, Pure from the radiant bosom of the sun. She met his Spirit at the lunar sphere, And sweet embrac'd him with maternal tear: âMy son! what joy unutterable flows To clasp thy bosom, freed from mortal woes! But we must forth! Lo, Heaven is waiting now, With flowers of amaranth to deck thy brow! âHearken! the symphony!âtheir harps are strung To give thee welcome with immortal song!â She said. And bore him in a cloud to heaven, Where full fruition to his soul was given. CANTO VIII. BATTLE AT THE RIVER RAISIN. ARGUMENT. The line of defence established on the North and North-Western Frontiers ... From Frenchtown, Messengers arrive at Fort Meigs with intelligence of the enemy .... Lewis and Allen detached to Presque Isle .... Their advancement from thence to the River Raisin .... The Battle .... The Ghost of Davis. The scene is laid at the above-mentioned places. The book commences at the surrendering of Hull, and ends within a few days of the closing of the first Campaign. From the time the Messengers arrive at the Fort, until Lewis gains possession of Frenchtown, is about two days. The Muse, her pinions from the deep expands, To sing the valour of the western bands; A race, descended from victorious sires, Sharp to be tested by afflicting fires. When Hull resign'd, through treachery and fear, Detroit and Michiganâthe west frontier; Opening a pass for savage monsters grim, In the sweet blood of innocence to swim; The nation stood bewilder'd in their grief; But, at the first, none gave it their belief. They from the Britons thought the tidings came To quench the ardour of their patriot flame: But when at length, against their striving will, Truth prov'd the fact; it made large drops distil From every bosom; palsied,âshock'd with dread,â Their hearts sunk motionless, like cold things dead: So when an earthquake, from the arctick pole To the antarctick, ruptures through the whole, Rocking the mountains like a troubled sea; Tearing foundations of the earth away; Drinking the rivers to their sources dry; Stifling in darkness the dissolving sky; The depths of ocean boiling as with fire, And nature reeling, gasping to expire; The dread convulsion strikes the nations dumb, Like marble pillars centred on a tomb. Something like this, the whole Republick stood, When fix'd they learnt their army was subdu'd. This passion stay'd,âtheir eyes their sorrows told; Tears of rank bitterness abundant roll'd Down their wan features, cast upon the earth, Pouring their sighs and lamentations forth. At length, their grieving waters ebb'd away, Though oft, at times, their cheeks were dash'd with spray. But when they heard their chosen President On various chiefs, of worth pre-eminent, Had power conferr'd to form the army new, Shelby the van,âthe savage to subdue; Each, all were quicken'd, save New Albion name, And rose to action like excited flame; The past was only written on their mind To urge their hands to what their souls design'd. As when a city, in deep midnight dire, Wak'd from its slumber by the shriek of fire, Alarm'd the dreamers hurry from their bed, While the shrill outcries through the darkness spread; A thousand bells half drown the screaming voiceâ The tumult thickens with bewildering noise; The streets alive with multitudes appear, A wildness painted in their look severe, Urgent to seek and overcome the flames; From tower and steeple the reflection gleams, Which fill the soul with horrour at the sight; A ghastly, pallid, and malignant light; Scar'd virgins, loose array'd, with anxious brow, Brief tapers trembling to the windows show; The artless beauty, quickening in their eyes, Hastens their footsteps where the danger lies: With energies like these, the brave arose To guard their country from increasing foes, While the fair maidens to their hearts endear'd, With tender efforts their advancement cheer'd. Brown, by the President's command, took post At the smooth Harbour Sacket's Harbour. of Ontario's coast. Pike join'd him thereâof honour next in grade; Not chiefs more valiant, ever drew a blade To check rude violence and ruffian wrongâ Plated with liberty and virtue strong. Far on the borders of Ontario round, Tompkins of York, with York's brave troop is found; He, in the senate, was the People's friend; And now, he stands a bulwark to defend Their infants, wives, their virgins from the foe, From whose stern eye no tear was seen to flow. The same time, Chauncey with bold promptitude, Prepares a fleet to navigate the flood. Perry, in bloom of years, at Erie's wave, Fashions a navy, with nerv'd arm to brave The boaster of the sea. At fair Champlain, Macdonough falls the willing oaks amain, Of which he lays the keels in time to bear, The naval thunder of Columbia there. From Penn's proud State, warriors in armour rise, A martial kindling pouring from their eyes; Crook leads them forth the savage to arrest, Marching through Erie to the regions west, To reach the Fort of Harrison,âof late Beset with monsters, terrible as fate; But Taylor stood and melted them of life With hardly twenty youths to hold the strife! This deed, no action ever will excel,â Not while the Wabash shall with spring floods swell. And Campbell, future in the song to rise, With Spartan band, destroy'd his enemies In desperate fights on Indiana's plain, Where many a wildman in his wrath was slain. The swain of Mississinewa will tell In future years, what giant monsters fell; And, as he ends the winter-evening tale, The dust of Campbell with a tear will hail. The meantime Croghan, with a cheek as fair As morning, soften'd with an April air, Stood like a veteran at the fort of Wayne, Against a multitude that swarm'd the plain; Till from Ohio, Harrison the mild Drove them disaster'd to their native wild; Aided by Leptwich with Virginia's prime, Who join'd his forces at the happy time, When at Urbana, he was camp'd for night; Three days advanc'd from his domestick site On the Ohio, pleasant to be seen Behind the sycamores in foliage green. Now when to Shelby the commission came, That he in age should magnify his fame, Without delay the summons he obey'd; Forth from its resting place, he seiz'd his blade, Gave by his country to proclaim his skill, When sunk the Cross on Carolina's Hill. King's Mountain. Though time has folded wrinkles in his face, His eye still sparkles with a warriour's grace. In council, cool,âin battle, like a fire Unquenchableâin which his foes expire. Kentucky, blest with fields of verdure rare, With which no earth can equal or compare, Proud with the veteran, sends her cohorts forth, Known for their deeds of chivalry from birth. Oft their sage fathers had the royals brav'd, And many a wild man in the combat grav'd, When Clark, and MacAfee, and Whitley, Gray, And Logan, Estill, led the ambush'd way. Next to the hoary chief, to rule the line, These worthy names like brotherhood combine: Payne, Lewis, Allen, Madison, and Mead; Hart, Hickman, Woolfork, known for daring deed, But gentle as the lambs that graze the hills, When dew of peace upon the land distils Its sacred balm to vitalize the soul, And bring the waste earth to the plough's control. Warriours one thousand, constitute their band; But ample numbers they expect at hand, Waiting as yet,ânot furnish'd with supplies To take the field against their enemies. Now for the Rapids of Miami's stream, They wind the pathâcasting a fearful gleam From burnish'd armour, on the savage eye, Lurking unseen to act their cruelty; But at the sight, they secretly retire Through tangled woods, like serpents in a spire. They pass through Wayne: here Croghan joins the band, The youthful Scipio of Freedom's land; Yea, by his deeds to shine a newborn star, Never to set in future ages far. Soon they, with hurrying footstep, reach the flood Of the Miami to be stain'd with blood. They pile their arms, and on its eastern shore, With labour sweating from their every pore, The walls defensive of a fort they build, To guard from royal inroadsâIndians wild. The axes play, the trees fall crashing round, And soon the bulwark rises from the ground. The name of Meigs the new-rais'd mound receives, For him, whose virtue in the memory lives; The governour chosen by Ohio's voice, The first in honour of the People's choice. The suasive Harrison, with anxious zeal, Forts the frontiers, th' invasion to repel. His bosom tremulous for his country glows, And the proud efforts of a patriot shows. Back from Miami like a star he flies, Meigs to assist to hurry the supplies; And all that possible can rise from one, Is by the warriour in his ardour done. Now hoary frosts the charms of summer freeze; Rude Autumn's breath strips bare the sorrowing trees; On the brown heath their faded robes are spread; The sharp wind whistles from the mountain's head; The clear blue streams hoarse murmur on the earâ Faint winds the sun cold round the northern sphere. The evening now prevails. The chiefs convene At Shelby's tentâunconquerable their mein: Lewis and Allen, Madison and Hart, And Graves and Hickman, tested every part, Yea, from the finest fibre of their brain To the last hair-thread of the simplest vein. The fort completed to a spacious size, They meet, the plan of warfare to devise, For now, by rumour, were the tidings brought, Adair, or Clay, was hastening with support. Scarce in pavilion were they seated, when, Panting arriv'd two half exhausted men. These Dun the sentry hails: âWhat strangers, there?â âFriends!â brief they answer'd: âSay, is Shelby here?â âHe is.âââO give him notice with expressions few, Two men from Raisin wish an interview.â Dun with the message passes to the chief, And thus proclaims it to his ear, in brief: âSage leader of the west! two panting painting men, With deep emotion pictur'd in their mein, Desire admittance to the general's tent, Express from Raisin with alarum sent.â His answer was a word: âEscort them here!â The youth return'd, and soon he led them near. The elder much concern'd: âColumbian's chief! We flew from Raisin, urgent for relief. Behold, the village is in wild distress; A regal band upon its limits press! Not in far distance are their grim allies, Whose gory knife our babes will sacrifice! Ere morrow's sun descends the western main, Sad we forebode our aged mothers slain!â Our wives, our sires, our lovely virgins fair, Will gasp in blood, unless thine arm be there! Early they pass'd from Malden o'er the lake, The full possession of the town to take. âThey scream with tiger voice for blood, inspir'd, That Campbell drove them, and their hamlets fir'd; And that their warriours in their strength were slain, By the firm patriots that defended Wayne: But what excites to violence their wrath, And makes them foam our every life to scath, Is, that their chiefs by Taylor were subdu'd; And ninety fell and soak'd the dust with blood. 'Tis this that thorns them in their bosoms sore, And drives them on to steep their hands in gore! âRevengeâa massacre is what they seek, Of unborn infants and young maidens meek! The village desolate with sword and fire; And all our aged in sharp flames expire! âVeteran! approachâO guard us with thy powerâ O comeâand save us this portentous hour! Save us from massacre, from writhing death; Redeem'd, we'll hail thee with our latest breath!â Thus he. And Shelby thus: âToo well I know Th' unsparing manner of the savage foe. Yet must I hope, thy fears thy tongue have taught To speak the peril greater than it ought. But thou shalt have what succour I can give; The deep anxieties of your heart relieve. âBut two battalions in advance can go To keep in check the passions of the foe; And they most ample will suffice to awe The allied bands, till I augment the war. As volunteers with different chiefs arrive, I'll haste them on, your courage to revive. âLewis, advance eight fifties, rank and file, And halt you not, till you approach Presque Isle. And, Allen,lead an equal number forth, A shield to guard the innocence of earth; There you'll remain, and fence your camp secure, Till I shall make your farther movement sure. Your onward banner will the foe alarm, Had he design'd to raise a murderous arm. Thus you your real weakness will conceal, And gain more profit than to charge with steel. âThe Albion breast must hold sufficient heart To stay the thrusting of the savage dart; Hence, let them quietly the town possess; Let that amuse and soothe them with caress, Till in our might we issue from the fort; Regain Detroit, and every friend support; The lake pass o'er, at Malden strike the blow; There wait the winter, and defy the foe. âLet Woolfork on the front observe them well; And should the wild men by their gestures fell, Reveal their dark intentions to upraise The fatal hatchet and the village blaze, Without the pausing to consult, advance, And with the bayonet check their violence. âThree days from this, my aid Adair will meet Our warriours here, and fill our ranks complete. Harrison from Ohio will return With that which makes the blood with life to burn; Hence, no entreatance from whatever source, Will sway your mind to yield the prudent course. A soldier courage ever should display, But his first lesson is to prompt obey. âI know your hearts with drops of honour beat, Never from equal numbers to retreat; But to subdue the passions of the soul, And curb them down to judgment's cool control, Is oft more difficult, than hot in fight To wield the falchion in a stream of light. âShould you, induc'd by savage insolence, Approach the enemy to drive him hence, By swift despatch to me the notice send, That I may press, the battle to contend. âMy views I've now divulg'dâwith judgment weigh The whole instructions in the needful day.â The valiant heard, and presently arose, And form'd their squadrons by the twilight close: MacCracken, Hickman, Simpson, Hart, and Mead, Martyrs for Liberty, by heaven decreed; And Graves, and Marston, Hamilton, Gerraud, Who but their fame, no circumstance regard. Williams and Bedsoe, Kelly, Ballard, Wells; And generous Woolfork, whom not earth excels: These the first rank, Kentucky's richest blood To brave the savage of the wild waste wood. The ready drummers beat the rumbling roll, While shrill the sharp fife echoes through the soul; The warriours formâa solid row of steel; Face to the rightâby even sections wheel. Lewis the movement speaks:âthe march resounds With Freedom's musick, which the heart rebounds. Their path is silver'd by the placid moon, That seems delighted with the nation's tune. The starry deities at first incline Their golden ears, as sweet in heav'n they shine; But soon they look enravish'd with the chime, And seem, with rubick feet, to dance the time. Now as the promises of morning smile, The warriours halt upon thy plains, Presque Isle. They spread their tentsâthe martial couch unroll, And snatch a hasty sleep to balm the soul. As rose the sun, the jealous sentries spy A cloud of dust progressing on the eye. And lo, three straining horsemen dim appear, Like arrows streaking through a misty sphere; The aged Brimmer, bleach'd his hoary locks; The next upon his rear, the generous Cox; Woodward, the upright judge, of feeling breast; The heralds three, that look with pain distress'd. They reach the camp,âtheir horses bath'd in sweat, Trembling with fatigueâpanting, parch'd with heat. Lewis and officers convene in haste, Their swords in baldricks girded round their waist, Soon follow'd are they by the horsemen three, Whose brows betray their souls' anxiety. Without a salutation Brimmer said, While a nerv'd palsy shook his aged head: âYe gallant chieftains of Columbian power! We've come to urge you to the Raisin shore! The darkening enemy is pouring on, Which urg'd us forth to make th' invasion known. Mating your numbers, they to us appear'd; We thought their bloody flag in air was rear'd! Be swiftâO hasten to redeem our lives; O snatch our infants from the savage knives!â The sad foreboding crowding in his breast, Silenc'd his tongue: And Lewis him address'd: âRude is the savage violence of warâ But oft 'tis swell'd by apprehensive awe; Hence, a warm hope is fluttering round my fear, That tells my soul this picture is too drear. âBy fix'd instructions here must I remain, Till reinforcements gather on the plain, And let the town be enter'd by the foe Without restraint, unless the Indians show Their purposes of wrath. The British band Will stay the kindling of the savage brand Against thy bosom's love. The village there Till then amuse, till Harrison, Adair, Our numbers shall make full. Three days from this, They'll join us hereâfor such was the express, Who left them on the march.â You thought you saw Their bloody standard floating in the air. But oft our apprehensions blur the sight To scan an object in its real light. âWoolfork I've sent with a detachment on, Wary to trace their progress to the town; And spread and magnify our strength abroad, By which their passions will be overaw'd; And thus the foe, through policy, will bind From acts of violence the savage mind.â Woodward arose, and in his place began, Whilst every eye was fasten'd on the man: âWhen deep the heart is with affliction torn, And all the prospects of the soul forlorn; When every hope has vanish'd from our view, And death in direful shape our thoughts pursue, 'Tis then beyond the strength of reason's force To calm the bosom with a mild discourse. â'Tis now in compass of your will to save Our friends from torture of a savage grave! I would not urge your orders to annul; But who shall now defend the infant's skull? Death's emissaries hideous crowd in view, The smiling life of sucklings to subdue! âMy heart forebodes were Shelby present now, He, without pause, would move upon the foe. Unfading laurels would the action crown; Bards, yet unborn, would sing of your renown; And virgin daughters of the virgins now, Would hymn your names with flowerets round your brow.â Allen was touch'd, and in his ardour rose, His eye a beam of heaven's pure lightning shows: âI feel impatience burning in my soul, That bids me break the bondage of control; What if we move?âmy blood,âmy heart beats strong To wield the sword against the savage throng! Can ever man contend in nobler cause, Than snatch the helpless from the tiger's jaws? And must we here remain to mark the sight Of human fires roll dreadful through the night? Hear the death-shrieksâthe agonizing screams Of babes, of mothers, melting in the flames? Heaven save me from the scene! My heart beats fire To crush the savage, or in flames expire!â Each in his place stood thrill'd at every word; And as he clos'd, they drew a flashing sword: âOn, Lewis, on! Our every pulse beats fire To crush the savage, or in flames expire!â The soul of Lewis quickens with the rest; Sad in the whirl, he loses the behest Of his superior chiefâthe cautions given Are by the excitement of his bosom driven Void from his mindâor if they touch the brain, The faint impression gives the slightest pain. He speaks the summons for the troops to stand To meet th' invading enemy at hand. Lost in the hurry to employ their arms, Their every fibre thrilling with alarms; None even think to send the tidings back To Meigs's Fort,âthe purpose of attack. At times, they apprehend they hear the cries Of dying infants shriek along the skies! So travellers passing Alleghany west, Stop at a spring to make their journey blest, By tasting in their draught the crystal tide, Where oft the brown deer gaz'd themselves with pride; Rude, mossy rocks, the gushing fount o'erhung, Deep in recess, embowering elms among While round they pass the cup, lo, in despair, A female shriek cuts sharp along the air! They listen breathless to th' alarming sound, And eye with chilling blood the glens around. Partial recover'd from the murderous scream, They mount, they spur, from whence the echo came; With palpitating hearts they pierce the gloom, The fair to rescue from a ruffian's doom: An equal ardour urges them with life To save the village from the sword and knife. The same time Reynolds with the Albion power,â A man, a soldier,âyea, a bosom flower, Compass'd with thistlesâreach'dâenter'd the town With grim Paluska: yet, no savage frown Was seen to settle on their serious brow; Curb'd in subjection by the generous foe. At noon the patriot columns from a height, Beheld the village under royal might; The Albion banner was aloft in heaven, By which, the life-chords of their hearts were riven. They heard no signs of lifeâby which they felt, That all was pass'd!âwhich made their bosoms melt. So when Columbus, from the coast of Spain, His second voyage re-travers'd o'er the main; His canvass swelling with unvarying gale, Bore him with gladness to Hispania's Isle, To give protection to an infant band, Which there he'd planted with paternal hand; With throbbing heart he gain'd upon the port, In sweet expectance, shouting from the fort, The welcome greeting of his friends to hear; To mark his banner floating up the sphere. But all was silent! Slow he made the beach, Where late he'd bless'd them with a farewell speech. The whole was buried in oblivion dark; And all extinguish'd was the vital spark! The fort was swept in ruins from its base By the inbreakings of the savage race; Columbus weeping, view'd the scene of death, With all his feelings in their graves beneath. Thus when Kentucky rose the prospect height, They thought to hear the shoutings of delight; But when they mark'd the capture of the town, A gush of tears from every eye rain'd down. But Woolfork comes,âproclaims the Albion chief A generous warriourânot a man of grief. Then, with slow movement, mounted on his horse, With pointing finger, shows his different force; Where lie the Britons, where the savage blood, To bar the passage of the frozen flood. When Reynolds mark'd the Eagle on the height, Swift he prepar'd his cohorts for the fight; Planted his cannon with superior skill, High on the summit of a steepy hill. A heavy brass frowns opposite the ford, To pour a flame of thunder at the word. The dwellings, near the stream, with arms are fill'd; And some the gardens, fenc'd with cedar, held. His clan, Paluska on the right commands; Reynolds, the left, where his artillery stands. What time that Reynolds thus, with jealous eye, Station'd his ranks, assailants to defy, Lewis, in columns three, display'd his bands; Th' impetuous Allen on the right wing stands; In centre, Madisonâthe left wing, Graves, Firm to his heart: Thus form'd to pass the waves, Bridg'd o'er with ice, Kentucky's sons remain, Waiting the summons. Lewis checks his rein, And wields his falchion: âWave the Eagle high! Forward! Their standards desolate, or die!â The three divisions with a shout, proceed To pass the streamâto conquer or to bleed. The breasted foe flash all their fires in vain To check their progress o'er the icy plain. A moment gains the shore! Lewis commands: âPass on, ye brave, and down the savage bands! Graves, Madison, the dwellings, pickets charge! Allen, the left! With fame the soul enlarge! Swell, swell the bosom to immortal cast; Quench, quench, extinguishâquench with blood the blast!â Graves, Madison, like eagles, rapid wheel, And leap upon the enemy with steel. Like driving hail the cutting bullets fly; Yet on they rush, with ruin in their eye, And open streams of life! The foe retires From bleeding bayonets and dissolving fires. The earth is sprinkled with the hostile blood! They break for shelter to a covering wood. The meantime, Allen, darken'd with his force, Where Reynolds dweltâdetermin'd in his course; Yet the bold Briton proud withstood the shock, Repeated, and again!âbut faulter'dâbroke, When Allen push'd the fourth! Yet soon, a stand He with Paluska madeâdefied the band Of Allen in pursuit. 'Hind mouldering trees, O'erthrown by whirlwinds, they protection seize, And on the columns of the free in turn, Their deep-mouth'd engines and their rifles burn. Firm, like a rock, in centre of his bands, Allen, alone, th' unequal strife withstands. His soul, as dire the blackening tempest grew, Rose in the storm! from right to left he flew, A meteor on the plains. Madison, Graves, With their battalions, like the ridgy waves Come sweeping onward mid the deafening jar, Like midnight thunder trains, to aid the war. Tumultuous, raging, tearing, drives the storm, Folding the earth in fiery clouds deform; The groans of wounded mix with savage yells; Through darken'd heaven the wild confusion swells; A fury's breath augments the frenzied fire; The blood-chok'd dying 'neath the blast expire. âOnârush the foe!â As Allen gave command, Mad dash'd the squadrons, bounding sword in hand. Thus the Miami, chok'd with icy flakes, When melting Spring its frozen bosom breaks; Betwixt two promontory rocks each side, Huge mounds collect, and dam its swelling tide. In vain Miami strives to gain a pass Through wall'd-up ice, impregnable as brass. At length, the weight of waters bends the moundâ It breaks!âbursting away with thundering sound, Down rolls the torrent!âwild waves foaming dash, And grind the ice-flakes with tremendous crash: Thus charge the heroesâAllied bands give way, Renounce their covert, broken in dismay. Hard press the victors, blazing on their rear; The wild men flying like the hunted deer. Reynolds, high wielding his broad falchion, cries: âWhere, whither will ye fly? O shame!âarise! And is your blood made dry? Britons, returnâ Wheel, face the storm! Like heaven the lightning burn! Your names put forth! Around the standard come! Bristle the bayonet! strike them to the tomb!â They rallied at his voiceârenew'd the fight, And rush'd, the patriots, cloth'd in meteor light. Lewis chaf'd high the passion of his soul, The time he mark'd them in their frenzy roll Back on his strength: âColumbians! planted stand, And proud receive them on the steel in hand! Behold, they come like whirlwinds in their wrath; A mist of death seems rising in their path; But not the mist of death, nor death's grim fire, Can aught avail, but to excite our ire!â As waves of ocean roll upon the shore, So rolls Britannia in her pride of power. Kentucky stands immoveableâa rockâ 'Gainst which the billows of the battling shock Break and recede along the ebbing flood, Exhausted, fainting with the gush of blood. Lewis mad lightens on their broken rear, Till lost in night the vanquish'd disappear. The victors now return to pass the night, Back to the village, wearied with the fight. Graves, Madison, in cedar'd gardens Gardens picketed with cedar. stand, But Allen camps on open field his band. Lewis, exhausted, his pavilion spreads Beneath two ancient oaks with leafless heads; He yields to sleepâwith battle overdone, And soon he heeds not how the moments run. Now scarce a murmuring whispers on the ear, Save owls complaining to the midnight drear. Behind the gathering of a spongy cloud, The stars faint glimmer as though chang'd to blood. Dread heaven! what dubious light, where Davis lies, Ghastly is seen! what pallid flames arise, Starting by fits! The moving grave behold! It yawns, it gapesâits heaving jaws unfold! The coffin stirs! ListâHark!âwhat rumbling sound Is heard within! The cavern shakes around! The dry bones rattle! Lo the black-stain'd lid Cracking gives way! In grave-shroud partial hid, Slow moves the rising ghost!âlike a thin cloud, Ascending drooping from a field of blood, Laden with damps of death! His pallid form Seems like the moon behind a gathering storm; His eyes, like faded meteors of the night, When morning glimmers with a sickly light; Faint as dim tapers winking at the day, Frightening the spectres to their graves away. Deep on his breast, his wound is seen in blood; Behold, he rides upon a murky cloud, His hair, like flame of fire! At Lewis' bed, Awful he stands, and like man dying said: âLewis, retire! or lo, thy standards yield! A mist of death is hovering on the field!â The voice the slumbers of the warrior brokeâ He marks the Spirit with bewilder'd look; His troubled hair stands shivering on his head; Cold, damping horrours his loose bones unthread; A clammy moisture wraps his body, pale; The vital pulses of his bosom fail; His tongue was held immoveable of speech, And, for a time, no blood his heart could reach. âFear not!â (the Vision thus began in few) âMy time is briefâI snuff the morning dew. Let virtue be thy shield whilst here on earth, And fear no wanderer from his grave stray'd forth. âLewis, retire! or lo, thy standards yield! A mist of death is hovering on the field!â A something more than mortal sooth'd his fear, And thus the hero with a starting tear: âHow art thou chang'd, my brother once in arms! Thy cheek, how wither'd of its martial charms! âWhat dire event hath call'd thee from thy home, Low in the dust, companion of the tomb? Does Death stride near us? Say, O tell me why, This summons given, the victory to fly? What mist of death? what reason to retire? Draw to my heartâI'm listening with desire To hear thy voice. Why distant dost thou fade? Say, what disturb'd thee in the dust low laid? Thy look is pleasant now. O ere we part, But once I ask to press thee to my heart!â He clasp'd the image of the vision near, But lo! it vanish'd in the midnight drear! Lewis, impress'd with awfulness, aroseâ His heart, foreboding, in his bosom froze. With hurried step, he forth to Allen went, To open to his ear the strange event. He found the warriour on his couch at rest, While dreams the fancy of the chief possess'd; Now, in pursuit, high bounding o'er the plain, Right onward dashing with the spur and rein. âAllen, arise! break slumber!â Lewis spoke. Up sprang the hero, half from dreaming broke: âHo! halt! they yield:âspareâsave themâ âWhat! a dream! Methought the foe just plunging in the stream! âWhat cause conducts you in the darkness here? Lewis, explain! Do savages appear? Shall I sound th' alarm?ââ âNo.â Lewis rejoins. Nothing at present interrupts the lines. Yet brief awaken, and from this returnâ Not time indulgent will admit till morn. Let all be done with midnight silence. Rise And shake dull slumber from the warriour's eyes.â He ended. Allen, with disorder'd look, Startled, and thus with hurried accent spoke: âAnd why this sudden movement to withdraw, Yea, while the foe is scatter'd in the war? Some weight, portentous, bears upon thy mind, That to the foe this stream River Raisin. should be resign'd; Methinks I mark depression in thy faceâ Back from thine eye hath fled the martial grace. Explain the weighty cause, I thee conjure, That I may bear a part, and half the pain endure.â âBrother in arms! from thee I'll nought conceal, But the strange secret of my soul reveal: âLo, an apparition in my sleep I saw, Which, for a time, my bosom chill'd with awe. Recover'd from surprise, distinct I heard A Spirit's voice, that scarce the night air stirr'd, As when the ocean sleeps, a zephyr's wing Ripples his cheekâor Nereides, when they sing: âLewis, retire! or lo, thy standards yield! A mist of death is hovering on the field! âI look'd, behold the form of Davis stood, Full in my view, his wound was damp with blood!â âDavis! not Davis!â (Allen in surpriseâ A wild expression glaring from his eyes.) âO, but for once could I his form behold, E'en were he clad with death robes, pale and cold! Our hearts were riveted in boyhood days, When rainbow Hope her loveliness displays. His voice would bring a sweetness of reliefâ A weeping joyâthe hallow'd tears of grief! âAnd was he like himself? what form? what look? O tell me all! what other words he spoke!â Lewis wip'd a tear. âNothing he spoke moreâ But wav'd his pallid hand from Raisin's shore! With throbbing heart I urg'd him to explain Where lurk'd the dangerâwhy forsake the plain; When, lo, he faded like the taper's blaze, Waning and dying as the night decays. I strove to clasp him to my heaving breast, When lo, he fled, a wreath of watery mist!â Thus he. And Allen thus: âLet us survey Th' event with calmness, ere the troops display: â'Tis cause of wonder he should leave the tomb To urge retreating in the midnight gloom, Except some brewing storm is gath'ring round To dash our glory, broken to the ground. But think what change subdues his spirit now, His joy was great to mingle with the foe. His glory, then, was armsâhe scorn'd retreat; As dark the battle grew, so rose the warriour's heat. âYou might have mus'd upon the hero, slainâ Hence it may prove a vision of the brain; For, when awake we fasten on a theme, It comes at midnight in an empty dream. âI nought can apprehend of danger near, That we the field should wake with words of fear! Admit the gathering foe!âwhen conquer'dâbeat, 'Twill be sufficient time to sound retreat! âYea: verily, if Davis pass'd your sight, Borne on the sable pinions of the night, To give us warning of approaching doomâ Of savage warfareâmassacres to come, I'd brave them all to let his spirit know That others dwell upon the earth below!â Him, Lewis answer'd: âYea: thy words are true, I thought of Davis at the Tipp'canoe, And Spencer's dust,âas how to fame they'd rose, Had they been with us, when we met the foes; Alas, what breast with sorrow hath not sigh'd, That they thus early for their country died! âIt may a vision prove,âbut sad I fear, Some dark, portentous, bloody scene is near. He look'd the same, save features ghastly wan, Clad in death robesâthe shadow of a man. âDeceiv'd I might have been: when toils relax, Or wasting griefs melt down the soul like wax; Fancy, unchain'd from Reason's silver curb, Runs antick in her course; a flyâan herbâ She forms an eagle, oneâand one, a beechâ This flies to heavenâthe other's branches reach, Touching the clouds. Yea, in a moment's breath, She circles earth, or wakes the dust of death. She lovesâshe marriesâchildren grow to ageâ Now, in the senate, now,âa menial pageâ Gains wealth by merchandizeâa beggar poorâ Now swallow'd in the deepâdeadâquicken'd and on shore! âThus Fancy mocks the time. In fleetest space, She lives an age, and runs a boundless chase; Hence the strange visit of the recent dead, May prove but Fancy playing round my head. Let time reveal the truth. Man is but dust, And dies but once. Th' event with heaven we'll trust. This said; he parted by the doubtful light, That faintly quiver'd from the stars of night. Sleep's heavy dew soon settled on his breast, And gave his senses to oblivious rest. The stars float round in blood! the dingy cloud Rolls down thick darkness, like a coffin shroud; Red angry meteors round creation glare, And at each other shake their fiery hair; The solemn bird screams hollow sounds of death, While ghosts are seen to flit along the heath. CANTO IX. DEFEAT AT RAISIN. ARGUMENT. The British Line of Defence .... Reynolds and Proctor .... The Battle at Day-light .... Lewis, a Prisoner .... Madison's Defence .... His Surrender. The scene is laid at the River Raisin .... The time is twenty-four hours. Now when by Hull the Patriots were compell'd To pile their arms upon a treacherous field, Prevost, at Kingston, of command supreme, Gave charge to Brockâworthy the poet's themeâ To leave Detroitâto fortress George repair To curb th' invasion of Columbians there; Or, war to wage upon the adverse shore, Where stood MacFreely with an infant power, At Fort Niagara:âThis of Prevost, Brock presently obey'd. Vincent took post At Queenstown height. Sheffie, brave, yet vileâ At York Little York.âto plan deep murder with a smile. Barclay, at Malden, buoy'd with conquering hope, Constructs a fleet with Perry proud to cope. Yeo, at Kingston, through Ontario's sea, To sail for Chauncy, bow him to the knee. Downie unfurls his Cross upon Champlain To make the efforts of Macdonough vain. At Brock's retirement from the army west, Proctor bore rule, with staining vice debas'd: Cruel, but yet a coward in the fight; Scenes of cold death his keenest joy excite. A braggart in command, a deer to flyâ A sycophant, when met with valour's eye. The next to Proctor in commission, stood The faithless Elliotâtreason in his bloodâ At birth enfranchis'dâhow severe to tellâ Link'd in close union with this son of hell! The deed proclaims him through the earth abhorr'dâ An adder in his heartâa saint in word. Dexon and Short are balanc'd in their fameâ Reptiles of earth would brighten by their name. Chambers, in rank the third from Proctor, holds, And to the world his character unfolds A brighter scene. He in the strife appears A man of honour, unappall'd by fears. The hordes of savages Tecumseh leadsâ A chief, whose heart was known for generous deeds. Though rais'd uncultur'd in the forest wild, Nature had stain'd him from a lisping child With marks superior, to command with awe In happy peace, or in tumultuous war. Fame tells the circumstance, that while a youth, His sire he follow'd from the hunter's boothâ A crouching panther, from an elm on high, Leap'dâand his father grappled by his thigh. Fearless he stood, and drew his feather'd dart, And pierc'd the foaming monster through her heart. His father rescuedâbold he sought her lairâ Confin'd her snapping whelpsâhis bosom bare,â And bore them to his cabin in the wood Where by degrees he tam'd their frenzied bloodâ Frequent he mountedârode them for his sport Around the borders of his father's court, Which rais'd a smile from his unsmiling peers, Musing in silence on his future years. His mind is piercingâquick to apprehend The hidden purpose of his foe, or friend. His tongue speaks eloquence: and though a flame In warâin peace he moves a gentle stream. Cawataw and Tekelah massacre, But yet a difference in their character; The former tortures his unhappy foe, The latter slays him with decisive blow. A gloomy host, whom desperate deeds delight, With these their leaders were encamp'd for night At Malden, on the borders of the lake, Ready to glide the ice when day should break, A larger compass of the soil to gain By giving strength to Reynolds on the plain: But when they heard the distant battle sound, Alarm'd, they rose, and startled at a bound. Now Reynolds, faint, returning from the fray, Met them advancing at declining dayâ Proctor beheld him with sarcastick look, And thus ungenerous to the warrior spoke: âWherefore is this? What causes you to yield? Why, like a deer, do you forsake the field? What, does your heart no valiant drops afford, That your hand, trembling, should let fall the sword? Your cheek with maiden blushesââ Reynolds rais'dâ And touch'd his bladeâhis eye indignant blaz'd: âForbear!âAnd have I to my utmost stood, Till half my numbers spent their dearest blood; Against superior bayonets, bar'd my breastâ Beneath a cloud of vaulting fire oppress'd, Thus to receive th' abuses of the tongue? Ingratitude! insufferable wrong! Preserv'd my shatter'd legions from defeatâ In such disaster, vict'ry was retreat, To bear this vulgar taunting to my face? It proves you wanting of a soldier's grace. To such indignity, my soul cries shameâ I would my heart were buried in the flame!â Proctor keen felt the sharpness of rebukeâ His colour went and cameâa coward look; But when was past the fluttering of his breast, Halting he answer'd with a fallen crest: âNo censure was design'd by what was saidâ Sooner my tongue would trifle with the dead. A freak of idle raillery was meantâ That was the measure of my vain intent. âThe theme no more; thy character is known With those, who add an honour to the throne. But now their numbers and their campment show, That we may plan a final overthrow. On virtue's rock, thy soul is bas'd too strong To heed th' unguarded playthings of the tongue.â Reynolds with dignity in turn replied: â'Tis now no time with discords to divide; In this, the weakness of Columbia liesâ Their wide divisions give us hope to rise. I'll bury private piques for public good, As every man that loves his country should. When near the foe, 'tis then a warriour's part To root resentment from his swelling heart. âLo, as the sun his proud meridian past, Kentucky's strength came pouring like a blast. Them, for these efforts, desperate we withstood, Whilst many a warriour strangled in his blood. At length, excited, as with fiery breath, They rose to drive us to the vale of death: Retreat ensu'dâunbrokenâcompactâslowâ With all our faces opposite the foe. âA faithful spy I left upon the rear, And every moment apprehend him here, I bade him watch their motions and return When they their guards should place, and night-fires burn.â Proctor, half smiling with quick voice rejoin'd: This foresight-prudence speaks your active mind. Here we'll abide the coming of the spyââ Scarce had he finish'd, when the herald nigh, Began with panting breath: âI've skimm'd the road Swift as the steed would bound beneath the goad: Their right division slumbers on the field, With no defence, save in their hands, they wield. âTheir left and centre, guarded 'gainst assault By planted cedars, difficult to vault. Except a slender guard, all seem profound Lost in their sleep, in tents upon the ground.â Now had the leaders gather'd round the spy, Who scarce had clos'd, when Proctor made reply: âEach chief, each officer, attend my willâ With strict regard each circumstance fulfil. âHere brief, our warriours, we'll indulge their sleep; But when yon star shines high with stillness deep, Each his command in marching order play, To gain the village, ere the appearing day. âWhen reviellÃ© shall hail th' approaching light, Tecumseh, rush and break upon their right. Cawataw and Tekelah, lead your band Beyond the stream, that none escape the land; And should they strive from massacre to fly, Butcherâlay wasteâon scalping-knife rely. No death forbear! Free plunder I proclaim; None shall have life to boast he had a name. âBrothers! for you our sovereign hath prepar'd, For every scalp, a bountiful reward. Batter, of those who bleed, their skulls in sport, For we with them shall decorate our court At York, Little York. Quebeck, at Kingston, Malden, good To show the valour of the red man's blood. âNot woman is my heart, hence small my care If from the captur'd you should seize the hair. So passing well you understand the art, You'll tear it off without a fluttering heart. The gold is yours, what sort soe'er you bring; Such is the liberal promise of the king! There's no distinction of the price for kind, Sires, infants, mothers, virgins, lame, or blind. âThink how they've plunder'd, robb'd you of the soil, And it must cause your every vein to boil. Lo, now's the offer'd time to search their bloodâ To tear their hearts and eat their flesh for food!â While thus the monster to the savage spoke, His lungs exhal'd a pestilential smoke, Such as the damn'd breathe out, who horrid dwell In deepest confines of the hottest hell. Tecumseh paus'd, and thus: âI've fought in warâ Look here, my breast! 'tis mark'd with many a scar. Tecumseh never fledâhis soul is braveâ His heel he never turn'd his life to save. âBrother, the Spirit Great beholds us hereâ Our heart, our action, in his sight appear. In fight, Tecumseh feels himself on fireâ Death fills his soul, when heaps on heaps expire; But cold in blood, Tecumseh never kill'dâ He binds the wounds that bleed upon the field. Kentucky knows no fearâme love the brave; He yieldâask peaceâmy hand be stretch'd to save. Tecumseh eats no heartânor drinks he bloodâ The elk and deer, the buffaloe, his food. âNever, in war, Tecumseh woman slewâ His hands, he never in their blood imbrue. He lead the blind, he aid the lame to walkâ He teach the youngâwith aged, hold a talk. âAnd does your king, your sovereign monarch wear, And other royal chiefs, the matted hair? We for our children keep them in their goreâ Never I knew them other use before.â While thus Tecumseh sternâProctor look'd wildâ Then cower'd to earth, and then an idiot smil'd. At times confounded,âburnt with anger now, Then, coward guilt subdu'd his haggard brow. At length, unwittingly: âBrother, I feel That you in battle have made red your steel With many an infant'sâ âNo: not this I meant, But that your enemies to death you've sent, Emptied of bloodâTheir scalps we useâ âAt more convenient season I'll declare, How we in love-knots braid the gory hair: But time now calls us to our couch away, To give our hearts bold vigour for the fray.â T' avoid his farther questions he retir'd With step uncouth, as with the moon inspir'd. Bent on revenge, at midnight grim they rise, And silent move, the Patriots to surprise. Still is the solemn hourâno light airs creep Along the frozen heath. The live things sleep. Soft from the clouds the feather-footed snow Descends and clothes the russet plains below. The forest whitening, dissipates the gloom Of heavy darkness; like a May-day bloom Of sugar-scented orchardâgladdening sight; Like a fair virgin in her robes of white. The enemy, assisted by the snow, Pursue the path to bring the Star-flag low. The instant they approach the village plain, Its rear Cawataw and Tekelah gain. Tecumseh hovers on the fenceless right, Where Lewis, Allen, slumber off the night. Proctor his engines levels at the mark, Which Madison defends from inroads dark. With lynx's eye they ken their destin'd prey To raise the hell-scream at the sign of day. Thus wolves in secret watch the quiet sheep, While on soft flowers in innocence they sleep. Their mouths, half open, drule to taste the food, And slake their parch'd-up jaws with fattening blood: So watch the savages.âAt length they see The twilight gleam, and hear the reviellÃ©! They riseâplunge forward,âhell outscreaming loud, Tecumseh flames, like burning midnight cloud; The planted cannon breathe a fiery breathâ The sleepers waken at the voice of death! As when the angel-minister of wrath Shall stand with foot upon the sea and earthâ And in the terrours of his God proclaim The hour arriv'd, that melts the world with flame; The nations waken at the voice, dismay'dâ And mark the shining spheres in blood to fade; So the dire peal froze every bosom dumb, As though the judgment-day of heaven had come. But soon they rose, like tigers from their lair, And lit their courage from the torch despair. Fierce from his covert, Madison drew aim With certain rifles at the cannon's flame. The rous'd-up Allen, instant of the peal, Sprangâleap'd his chargerâtouch'd him with his heelâ And flash'd along the plain, a meteor lightâ By word and action stirring up the fight: âTo arms! snatch arms! Stand forward in the blast! Battle unbending, while that life shall last! Dissolveâmelt down the enemy with heat; If death be ours, his spear we'll smiling greet!â His warriours break their panick-spell, and form, And fill the icy elements with storm; Incessant vollies roll impetuous, direâ The ranks of either army vault with fire. Yet still the savages the brave surround; Blood-strangled heaps lie smoking on the ground. Allen, a besom, through the wild men strode; In nerveless attitude, they view'd his mightâ And, for a time, forgotten was the fight. So when mad whirlwinds down the mountains pour, Whilst round their skirts the stormy spirits roarâ Bending the pines of heavenârending the oaksâ The solid mountain, from its basement, rocks; The howling monsters shudder in their dread, Unknown, if breathingâor their bodies, dead! At length, recover'd from their dumb despair, They fly precipitate from ruin there: So stood the wild men, motionless with awe To mark the hero kindle in the war; But, when recover'd partial from surprise, Back they recoil, whilst fire in thunder flies. Tecumseh ralliesâheads his foaming tribe, His big heart swelling with a warriour's pride: âPour on to battle with the force of death! Let breathing life be strangled of its breath! As when the lake is toss'd to heaven in wrath, Follow Tecumseh! Open out a path!â He said; and peal'd the yell with triple rage, Arms clash with arms, and flames with flames engage. The tumult thickens with a deafening sound; Fresh streams of blood gush frequent on the ground. Once more the wild men seem to yield the fight; Where Allen labours, numbers gasp in night. His falchion sparkles like a blade of fire; Before its edge, his bravest foes expire. Tecumseh, rising to his height supreme, Madden'd his bands to rush upon the flame. They meet impetuousâruin in their eyeâ Streams of live lightnings from their falchions fly, As edge to edge they clash! Lo, Allen's aim Glanc'd from the skullâvoid on the shoulder came, Cleaving the bone. Tecumseh's anger flow'd; Pressing his heart, whilst death's grim look he show'dâ And, at a blow, struck Allen to the brain; Reeling he falls upon the gory plain, Like elm majestick by the woodman slain. His Spirit mounts upon the wings of fire To reach the world that satisfies desire. Lo, as he fell, the savage started round, Struck to behold him prostrate on the ground: But thought returning, they their fears dismiss, And round the ruin'd warriour darkening press, Grasping his matted locks to bare his head; But lo! Tecumseh threatens vengeance dread: âForbear! I speak the word. Sharp flames ye feel, Who dare to touch the hero with their steel! The warriour bold me lov'dâa breast of fire; He breath'd a soul, that valiant men admire. Like a big oak, he fellârenown'd in fame; Let not a finger dare his form to maim!â Aw'd by his voice, they scatter'd from their prey, As when a tempest sweeps the clouds away. Soon as the brave beheld their leader low, They broke, dishearten'd, through the drifted snow, To where Cawataw and Tekelah knelt, Watching their time to cause their lives to melt. With aspect hideous as the fiends beneath, They burst with yelling to the scene of death, Their standard waving blood! Deafâdeaf to voice Of pleading mercyâin their hell, rejoice. Lewis the Patriots labours to re-form: âStand in a cube, and die with soul in storm! Let the heart burn with courage from despair, Till the brow shows the image of it thereâ Image of death with a convulsive air! This,âthis our only hope! In vain to flyâ Blood be our winding-sheetâand joy to die!â His voice was inspiration to the soul; They rise to perish, while in flames they roll. As falls the grass before the sweeping blade, So in pil'd swathes the monsters grim are laid. But yet, so numerous is the tiger foe, Ten rush to arms, where one receives a blow. Graves, Woolfork, Hickman, Hart, MacCracken, Steel, And others fainting in the carnage, reel. The learned Simpson falls, a beam of light, On five, his victims bloody in the fight. By small degrees, the wasting patriots yieldâ Dead, or deep scarr'd upon the crimson field: An island thus in Susquehanna's stream, Cloth'd with fat pines, which, scorch'd by lightning flame, Kindles and spreads in widening circle round, And mounts in volumes to the clouds profound. At length, the waves in rapid floods descend, And round the isle in narrowing compass bendâ Inch after inch upon the flames they grow, Till deep they drown them in the overflow: So by degrees, their failing strength was lost By gathering numbers of the savage host. Lewis, contending with the slaughter, rode, Till his proud charger, wasted of his blood, Sunk to the earth:âhis foot the stirrup held;â Tekelah saw, and rush'd along the field, Two chiefs in train, rolling their savage eyes, Who, with loud shouting, seize him for their prize. Tekelah guards his lifeâthe others strive In vain their weapons through his skull to drive; 'Tis his design, Kentucky shall advance An ample sum for his deliverance. The disappointed Those who strove for his life. draw their clotted knife, And scalp the wounded as they gasp for life; Then swing the battle-axe in furious mood, Breaking the skull bonesâmixing brains with blood! Tecumseh listening,âfrom the gory stream Hears the sharp death-note of their dying screamâ Swift at the sound, he urges on his horse, A shooting star not fleeter in its course. What time Cawataw slaughter'd in his path, The mighty warriour with indignant wrath Outpour'd his voice impetuous on the plain, Which from the wounded drew away their pain: âStand! let the dying die! The conquer'd, save! They yield the battleâbut they've fought us brave. He, who shall lift his axe to smite with death, Shall be despatch'd, and cast upon the heath! Me call big thunder from yon cloud in heaven, And he that strikes, shall with its bolt be riven!â They rais'd their hands all dripping with the bloodâ Cawataw drank the streams in savage mood! Cloy'd with the horrid draught, he spar'd the restâ But dug the heart from many a freezing breast To form the horrours of a future feast, To melt with luxury on his vulturous taste. As Lewis now was by Tekelah led To Proctor, grief upon his bosom fed; His eye caught Simpson, with unsightly wound, From which the dark gore oozed upon the ground. He mourns his fall with willow-stooping head, Shedding fast drops of sorrow for the dead. At length, thus mused his soul: âAh, envious doom! O that, with Simpson, I had fill'd the tomb! Then, then, I never should have mark'd this scene, But reach'd renown with those of martyr'd men. Thy name, O Simpson! ever will be bless'd; A beam of fame will on thy mem'ry rest. Mute is thy tongue, that once, sublime, was loud To speak thy country to the listening crowd; And held the senate charm'd, where Scott Gov. Scott. was first To arm Kentucky for the battle just. But now, to compass what thy soul desir'd, Thou hast eternal on the field expir'd: âAs some proud elm exalts its head on high, Spreading its verdant branches to the sky; Its breathing leaves the airs of life inhale, And catch, delighted, the inspiring gale; Sweet to its boughs the spring-time songs are given, Bedeck'd exquisite with the gems of heaven; In all its pride, the woodman bends it down; It yields to death amid its bright renown: âThus, Simpson, thou, full-honour'd in thy fame! And when I die, O may I die the same!â Such thoughts as these revolv'd within his breast, As o'er the bleeding scene he mov'd distress'd. What time the battle rag'd upon the right, The guarded Madison stood strong in fight, Though Proctor's army compass'd him around, And flam'd the air and shook the earth with sound. The brazen tubes with infant lightning flash; At times, the globes against the cedars crash; Yet stood the Patriots, to their fastening hold, And many a Briton into darkness roll'd. Reynolds from Proctor now receives commands: âSelect the veteransâchoicest of the bands, And storm the enemy! Too long we wait; Thrust with the bayonet; strike them desolate And shall Tecumseh triumph on the right, And we, the Royals, not achieve the fight? No: never shall it be! Reynolds! display, And sweep yon standard from its place away.â The valiant Reynolds without pause obey'd; His veteran columns, in their steel, display'd, And led them to the charge. But low on earth Twice fifty Albions pour'd their life-streams forth. The Patriots raise a canopy of fire, As though from Ãtna did the flames aspire. Not long the foe the ruins would withstand; They reel'd, they broke, they scatter'd o'er the land; And Madison, in fulness of his soul, Express'd his feelings, and made strong the whole: âStand, Freedom, stand! Kentucky, never give! Outlook the scowl of death, while life shall live! No: never, never shall they pass our steel, Till fix'd their hearts upon its edge we feel. Yea, if our brothers on the right must die, Our arms shall light them to eternity!â Kentucky heard his voiceâdetermin'd stood, Planted to earth, till sacrific'd their blood. The mean time Proctor, chafing in his ire, Beheld the bravest of his host expireâ To Elliot thus, abrupt: âWith banner go, And speak the voice of terrour to the foe; Say, that I bid him to remove his power, Or tiger monsters shall his flesh devour!â This ruffian order, which his heart defil'd, Elliot attended, while his bosom smil'd. He waves the flag of peace. The parley beats; Proud he advances, and the word repeats: âMadison, my brother! yield, O yield! To Proctor, merciful, resign the field! If longer you maintain the desperate strife, Th' unbridled savage will make cold thy life!â Madison paus'd deep, hating to reply, While scorn and pity struggled in his eye: âAnd is it possible, I mark thee now With Proctor leagued to lay thy nation low? Thy nation eminentâthe prime of earthâ Which gave to thee a freeman's honour'd birth? âCouldst thou this message with indifference hear? And durst thou speak his mercy to my ear? But he, who can with howling fiends unite Against his country, striving for her right, His heart is blacker than the souls that dwell In deepest dungeons of the damn'd of hell. âBlotâinfamy! deserving every name, That stamps a man indelible with shame. Call not me brother! eat thy words again, Thou blighting mildewâto mankind a stain! Fly to thy safety! hide thy monster formâ My soul is kindling with avenging storm!â Elliot stood pale to mark the hero's brow, Scowling a tempest-wrath to smite him through. But soon, with trembling, he to Proctor turn'd, Who at the instant like a fury burn'd; He stamp'd, he foam'd,âblood crowding every poreâ His hard-strain'd eyeballs oozing drops of gore. While thus enrag'd, lo, Lewis captive cameâ At sight of whom he sooth'd his anger tame. A sudden thought quick flash'd upon his brain, By language smooth his influence to gainâ And, by his sway on Madison the bold, To cause him to resign his desperate hold. So thus, when Satan, in portentous hour, Stood gazing on the charms of Eden's bower, A storm of passion rankled in his breast, Which his rent features outwardly express'd: But soon, lest flaming guards of seraphs night Should mark the flashing of his lowering eye, He smooth'd the envious scowls, which marr'd his face, And deck'd his lineaments with cherub grace: Thus Proctor cool'd the boiling of his bloodâ Muffled his hellâand thus, in mildest mood: âTo be thus captur'd is the fate of warâ But now my arms shall shelter thee with care; Thy matchless valour, where death hurls his dart, Deserves a noble tribute of the heart. â'Tis grief that Madison should thus contend, In hopeless strife, his weakness to defend. His powers must stoop, howe'er so brave they fight, And strike his flag to our superior might. Ah! then, not all my strength,âno human power Could check the savage in that dreadful hour! They stand with longing mouths to taste the food Of quivering flesh, and fatten on their blood! Noneânone will breathe of lifeâthe whole must fallâ A general murder whelm, and bury all! âSpeak but the word, and your redeem their fateâ Rescue your brothers, ere it prove too late! Now I could guard them from the savage ireâ None, none should harm them, or by axe, or fire. âBy generous Elliot I despatch'd a truce; But Madison for this return'd abuse. 'Tis but to spare unnecessary blood, That I in parley have with mercy stood. âBut think, O think! how brief could I consume This budding village, soon with arts to bloom! But that, I give no thought; yet should they press, How possibly the flames could I suppress? âLewis! persuade thy brothers to resign, And righteous fame will be forever thine. Whose hand but rescues one devoted life, In the dark hour of universal strife, The proudest honour to his worth is given; His conscience whisper 'tis an act of heaven!â Artful he spoke. Him Lewis sternly ey'd, And, to the serpent hypocrite, replied: âThough that my flesh is captive and confin'd, Yet free remains the element of mind; And as the mind thou bad'st me to reveal, No silk-worm cloak my bosom shall conceal: Art thou so wild a stranger to the soul, And the deep motives, that her acts control, To think I'd succour give to bring them lowâ Invite my brothers at thy feet to bow? â'Tis in thy power to conflagrate the townâ To sweep the whole in desolation down; This power you'll not exert: I'm not deceiv'dâ Things pointing opposite are disbeliev'd. Thou hast the secret of thy heart betray'd; Thy darkness open to my mind is laid. What man communicates, he must have thought; This reason to the soul hath ever taught. âWould I advise my kindred to resign To one, whose bosom is corrupt as thine? Much rather, I'd behold them toil in death, And see them smiling, as they gave their breath! âElliot you sent, commission'd with the truce; Would honour'd man been guilty the abuse? What, send a traitor with the sign of peace! No soldier's heart would suffer the disgrace. âNow power have you the savage wrath to quell, And keep suppress'd the murder of their yell. And pray what weakness does your wisdom see, That from restraint, hereafter, they'll be free? I fear your heart is rotten at the core, And that you urge them in their thirst for gore! âHeaven pass'd your lips, as finish'd you your speech; But heaven, I fear me, thou wilt never reach, Unless that hypocrites assemble there With those, who join the savages in war; For where these monster infamous are sent, A station thou wilt hold pre-eminent.â The guilt of Proctor chain'd his efforts dumb, While Lewis, answering, drove the subject home. During the time, a guard was station'd near, Who, with brief order, led him to the rear. Proctor to Reynolds, grum: âMad, or a fool; The moon in change has struck upon his skull. âIt now behooves us, with nice-weighing care, We poise our plans on Madison to bear. Straight with a banner to Kentucky move; Whate'er your promise, I'll in faith approve. For twice four hours they've warr'd against our hostâ The pride of royal armiesâAlbion's boast. Full eight times fifty press the gory plain, Beside the wounded, groaning with their pain. Pledge them their side-arm weapons; gracious speak, That I will give what valiant men should take. Small it avails with bayonets to engageâ And ball and fire quell nothing of their rage. Pledge them protection from the savage hordesâ And every grace, that honour'd war affords. âBut should they hesitate to yield their force, I'll search them to the life in savage course; The village round shall blaze with sudden fire; Ruin shall follow; every age expire!â He ended like himself. Reynolds advanc'd; His plume, deep shading o'er his temples, danc'd. Near the defence he halted; thus exclaim'd, While generous feelings in his bosom flam'd; âMadison! brave enemy! to you I bring Proposals from the general of my king. He scans the narrow pass to which you're driven; If you surrender, guardianship is given. Side weapons you'll retain; all private, yours; Thy dead shall be entomb'd upon the shores; A healing care thy wounded shall receive, And none with reason shall have cause to grieve. These terms he bound by oathâhath pledg'd his word, That he to you will generous aid afford. âIf you resistâit pains me to declare His threats to push exterminating war. The village will be fir'd; and every age,â Thy babes, thy fair ones, feel the savage rage! âIn mercy yieldâO yield the gloomy fightâ Let not mine eyes behold the blinding sight!â A solemn pause. At length, the brave replies: âI know the manner of his fierce alliesâ By these I'm not deceiv'd; but those I fear, Who in the robes of civil arms appear. The man who threatens bloodâsuch vengeance dire, To cast our virgins and our babes in fire, Never can be true! Nothing will I yield, Till death shall drag this body o'er the field. When that deep hour shall comeââ Thick piles of smoke The farther utterance of the hero broke. Lo, with a sudden rush the flames arise, 'Mid female shrieks and infants' feebler cries! Proctor had sent Cawataw with a torch To light the dwellings, and the aged scorch; E'en at the moment that his herald stood, Pledging his faith against the monster brood! Distracted mothers fall upon their knees, Praying surrender to his enemies: âYield, Madison! O yield! resign thy power! Surrenderâsave usâthis all-dreadful hour! The savages! behold! We shall be spar'dâ And prayers of holy men are thy reward!â The hero dropp'd a tear: âI yieldâto save Matrons and infantsâvirgins from the grave!â The Starry-banner from its glory fell! The banded legions shouted forth their hell; Earth groan'd with pangs deep-heaving from her womb, In dark foreboding of the woes to come! CANTO X. MASSACRE AT RAISIN. ARGUMENT. Invocation .... March to Malden .... The Place of Slaughter .... Indians receiving pay for Scalps .... Savage Orgies .... Elliot's Hypocrisy .... The Massacre .... The Conclusion. The scene is laid at the River Raisin .... Malden .... and on the Road between these two places. The time is about thirty-six hours .... from Madison's Surrender, till the end of the following day. Alas, what darkness overspreads my soul! Why do these tear-drops from my eyelids roll? Why doth the colour from my cheeks depart? Why doth the blood stand freezing round my heart? Why, like the willow, do I stooping grieve? Why deep, unutterable, doth my bosom heave? The theme, alas! the soul, o'erwhelm'd with griefâ WhitherâO whither shall I find relief? What pitying hand will stay my weeping brow? Whom shall I supplicate for succour now? O Thou immense, mysterious Power! Grant me thy impulse, this portentous hour; Lean Thou from Heaven! My bleeding thoughts inspire; O touch my lips with vitalizing fire! Give my affections strength to view the sceneâ The cold-blood massacre of helpless men. My bleeding numbers, let them flow along In mournful, melting melody of song. Sustain my trembling nerves, relaxing faint, That with Truth's pencil I the scenes may paint; Scenes that must meltâmake floods of anguish flow From eyes that never wept for human wo; Dissolve the marble heart to fibres, bland As new-born infant's from thy plastick hand! Methinks I feel Thy strengthening influence nigh, By sudden passion that distends mine eye: Thou dread Invisible! is this the sign, That Thou art near to succour my design? I tremble with its power! It lifts my wing; By thee upheld, the theme of death I sing. Scarce had the Eagle sunk upon the dust, When Proctor, hell-inspir'd, with soul accurs'd, Withdrew remote his cohorts from the plains, And loos'd the savages, with boiling brains, To seize the patriots,âstrip them to the blast, Which, like a monster, howl'd along the waste. âHeaven, all-merciful!â (Madison in wo,) âWhere is thy sacrament of honour now? Where from the savage do thy deeds excel? Where thy protection from this race of hell?â Proctor, I call thee to revere thy word, Or swift despatch us with thy whetted sword. We stand defenceless, shivering on the heath; Our breast is naked to the shaft of death!â The savage yell, the echo of the drum, Smother'd his utterance, which had hoarse become; A thousand passions agonize his breast; Now vengeance rack'dâand now, with grief, depress'd. They think of home, where sweet endearments twine To balm their souls with sympathies divine. With deep heart silence they endure their fate; No tears, descending, ease th' oppressive weight. Of hope bereft, with elevated eye They ask of heaven the privilege to die. The miserable Proctor mark'd the scene Smiling, with hell disfiguring his mien. But Reynolds sought and found him in the throng, And thus his generous heart inspir'd his tongue: âProctor, O hastenâhasten to afford Succourâprotection, plighted by thy word! Plighted by word? what heart of flesh can bear To see them nakedâshivering in despair, And notââ âNot what? Suppress that woman note!â (Proctor rejoin'd, with grating from his throat;) Well do I know the purpose of the king, And need, from none, remembrance of the thing. âCawataw, file them, and Tekelah now; And march to Malden through the drifting snow. I, with the Albions, shall proceed before, And you, in charge, will bring Kentucky o'er Save the disabled; these will here remain For your return to ease them of their pain. Within the place of slaughter, them you'll crowd; Where Night's cold breath may cool their fiery blood; Let nothing dead receive the burial rite, But let them stare at heaven with vacant sight! He clos'd, gnashing his teeth; and ghastly smil'd So horrible, the savages look'd wild. In martial pomp, the regal bands retire, Leaving the Patriots to the savage ire. Far in advance, Tecumseh singly rode, Deep musing to himselfâhis wonted mode. Proctor the mettle of his steed restrains, Leading the van, in form, upon the plains. The generous Reynolds on the rear proceeds, Whilst, of his heart, its every fibre bleeds. The savage chiefs, impatient for their prey, In pairs the captives couple for the way; But those, disabled by their wounds, remain To be, by ruffian hands, in weakness slain,â Of whom Hart, Hickman, Woolfork, Graves, are plac'd With those, whose virtues have their country grac'd. Cawataw's voice vociferates aloud, Rough as a storm descending from a cloud: âRed man! be red;âKentuckyâvengeance good; Watch in his eye; he faint, despatch; find blood; Bad colour be the snow; make white look red; Wring out the heart; eyes darken; open the head!â This thunder'd forth, they raise a dismal howl, Like prowling wolves, when o'er fresh graves they growl. Their unclad captives shiver in the blast; Each painful footstep threatening them their last; Famish'dâice-chill'dâby toils and griefs subdu'd, They envy those stiff-frozen in their blood. Faint and more faint, the wounded tottering grow; Yet still they strive, against their power, to go. Steele faltersâfails, through torture of his woundâ Cawataw hacks him to the icy ground. The war-axe enter'd o'er his fading eye, And brains and gore in scattering ruins fly. He sinks upon the earthâa slender reedâ The monster sucks the wound in triumph of the deed! In every bosom, terrour froze the blood; In each wild eye, fix'd horrour ghastly stood. In Steele, they learn their certainty of fate, If they their progress through the snows abate. They labour to surviveâAlas, in vain! Armstrong falls back, and in his path is slain. Young Weathers falters next: Fainting he stoodâ His beardless cheek all pale through loss of blood. He on Tekelah lean'd for his defence, And silent plead with nature's eloquence. The savage paus'd; but lo, Cawataw near Sunder'd his skull above the dexter ear; Dizzy in death he whirl'dâgasping, sunk low; His blood stain'd red the innocence of snow. Scarce thus a lamb the flowery vales had trod, When lordly man demanded him for food; Cruel the slaughterer stabb'd; death seal'd his peace; His sweet blood hissing stain'd his milk-white fleece: So Weathers fell, and dy'd the snow with gore; The deed to crown, his scalp Cawataw tore. At length, these murders wounded Reynolds ear, Slow-lingering, heart-sick, on the Albion rear. With loosen'd rein, he swift to Proctor flies, Bearing a fearful terrour in his eyes: âO listen with regard! I bound express; Scarce beats by bosom, palsied with distress! The race of hell in slaughter are combin'd; I heard the death-notes peal upon the wind! The captives, lo! they torture in their sport; Let not rough passions now thy brow distort. Let me not plead their misery in vain; Britannia calls thee to relieve their pain! âListen! methinks I hear a dying shriek Torture the air! Shall I the order speak?â Proctor, half smiling, like a fiend began: âNot for this merely did you seek the van? By your wild countenance, I darkly fear'd, That all Kentucky had in arms appear'd. I hear a shriekâanotherâlist, how shrill! Anotherâhark! with what despatch they kill! âReynolds, cast off this woman from your soul; Look on my eyes! how equally they roll! I would not have a heart, that could not bear To hear a scream of death upon the air. âMust I here check the march to hush their cries? How soon the dying end their miseries! Admit at times they sever hands or feetâ 'Tis known they operate in surgery neat. âThe Indians are good surgeons.ââ Proctor. 'Tis true, they never lectur'd in the schools, Which serve to guide the drones by leaden rules; Self-taught, they scorn the drudgery of art; They know the skill to mend a ruptur'd heart. âAnd what is life to miserable man? The wise have answer'd: Nothing but a span! And death they term a messenger of peace; Hence, for Kentucky, 'tis a day of grace; For where, than these, more wretched can we find? Without nobilityâno royal mind! No titled eminence they ever see; Unknown to them a king's sublimity! What if they bare their bleeding skulls for gainâ Britannia calls me to relieve their pain! âReynolds, give o'er this love-sick song of thine; Here, take my station on the front of line; Your place will I maintain upon the rear; Their shrieks are not unpleasant to my ear!â âI pleadââ âAlready are you answer'd, and no more! Go; be a woman; give the war-trade o'er. Lead you the way upon the front, for fear You at a savage voice might faint to hear!â Reynolds, with pausing, the command obey'd, Whilst a dead pressure on his bosom weigh'd. At first he thought his martial rank to yield, And leave the arduous service of the field; But soon reflection whisper'd to his soul, He might save one, unhappy, in control Of ruffian monsters in the wild wood west, And that would ease the anguish of his breast. Meanwhile Cawataw urg'd the work of death! Full many a Patriot gasp'd away his breath. Now Brewer, faint through age, with languid eye, Prepares his soul for immortality: âThou Power supreme! beyond the reach of thought! Whom none can comprehend, or know thee aught! Deign to incline a hearkening ear to dust; Vouchsafe mortality in Thee to trust. Deign, from Thy mercy-seat, to bend thine eye, Thou balm in peace, Thou hope in misery!â Cawataw rush'd, impetuous in his rage, Foaming, and seiz'd, with bloody hand, the sage; Hard bound him to a beech, with matted thong, Then chok'd his breath, and fasten'd on his tongue, And tore it out: then at a distance stood, And hurl'd his hatchetâsunk it in the wood, Grazing the tongueless man. A slender hair Oft made the distance from his thin skull bare! At length the savage, tiring at the sport, Hard grasps his scatter'd locks with wild effort, And, while severe he brandishes his knife, Makes many a feint to pass upon his life. Thus a wolf, leaping from a hanging rock, Fangs in his jaws the father of the flock; In vain the victim struggles to retreat; Firm to the earth he binds him with his feet; And to prolong the horrible of death, He foams, he smites, he grinds, gnashes his teeth, Making a pass to seize upon his throat, Deep howling in his ear a dying note: So the fell savage tantalizes life, By the mock motion of his passing knife. The steel, at length, he plunges to the hilt, Striking his heart, causing his life to wilt. His aged head is dropp'd upon his breast, His soul ascending to the mansions bless'd: So a proud ash, on Catskill's craggy height, Had brav'd the riving thunders in their might; And firm, unshaken, on its centre stood Against the whirlwind and the beating flood: But, in its years, it feels a slow decay; Deep-eating Time consumes its strength away. A woodman comes, and girdles it around; Its scanty juices ooze upon the ground; It droops its head, thin scatter'd o'er with leaves, And deep within its heart mortality receives: Thus bow'd the sage: thus languid ooz'd his blood, Bound fast to moulder to the cruel wood. Oft as a fainting warriour stops, a blow Sends him to stiffen, naked on the snow; While some, more sad, are to the forest led Piecemeal to die by lingering fires slow fed. At length, the lake cross'd o'erâat town arrive The monster train; none wounded are alive. Where things for slaughter live severe, they're press'dâ The sting of misery lancing every breast. Raving for food, their hunger to allay Many through frenzy on their live flesh prey. Their tender feet, expos'd upon the snow, Ooze blood in dropsâintolerable the wo. Cramp'd are their aching joints, with cold made numb; They groan, they struggle to descend the tomb; But Death turns savage, and delays to throw Th' impatient arrow from his bended bow. Lewis breaks forth, a wildness in his eye, Rack'd with the madness of his agony: âYe scowling clouds of heaven! in what deep path Lie hid your secret ministers of wrath? Master your furyâlet your shafts be hurl'd With judgment fire to conflagrate the world! Let all your tempests congregate in heavenâ And be the universe from centre riven! Let death's deep pall coffin the stars of nightâ And let the sun be strangled of his light!ââ He paus'd in anguish, by his thoughts o'erpower'dâ His feelings such as not to be endur'd: âIs earth a place of hell! Death, blind mine eyeâ BuryâO hide me from this misery! Such daylight bloodshed ne'er before was done In all the sickening circles of the sun! Mine is the torture, mine! Alas, I feel A cancerous wound, that time can never heal! Was it not me, that led the Patriots brave? With mine own hands I dug their martyr'd grave! Did I not lead them to the savage sword, Never to Shelby sending back the word? Yea, even now he apprehends, that we Are at Presque Isle in all our liberty! Outrageous thought! Thou Merciful, above, This mountain pressure from my breast remove! âThe buried Davis rent the prisoning tomb, And solemn warn'd us of these woes to come! How then could I with conquest have retir'd, And every bosom of the nation fir'd! âThis cold, this hunger, well can I endure, But who can min'ster to my mind a cure?â A shower of tears came pouring from his eyes, While thus, with soothing, Madison replies: âMankind too frequent 'bitter their distress, When clouds of thick misfortune round them press, By keen reflecting in the suffering hour The way they might have shunn'd the afflicting power, When, if they had the other course pursu'd, A weight, more heavy, would their souls subdu'd. Chance sometimes guides the traveller aright, But reason is the star-directing light: When we proceed according to its guide, Though sad misfortunes may our path betide, Yet we have acted with our minds awake, And we from that should consolation take. âAdmit we never from the Isle advanc'd, And savage fire had at the village glanc'd; (For then we knew not who the generous man Who led to Raisin's stream the hostile van;) And babes and mothers had in flames consum'd, And virgin innocence to torture doom'd, And nothing we had strove for their relief,â Would not our hearts have broken with the grief? âIntemperate ardour led our minds astray; 'Twas this that caus'd the bleeding of the day. Let none accuseâwe acted for the best; It adds a pang to misery distress'd. âBut who approaches? look!â Here Proctor came, Causing with wrath each bosom to inflame: As when that city fires have partial spent Their furious dashings through the firmament; Slow by degrees they sink to ashes down, And farther cease to desolate the town; Behold, a tempest, rushing from the north, Descends and drives them with new terrour forth; Soon in the whirl they reach their former height; Whole squares involv'd, cast horrour through the night: So at the sight of Proctor, every breast Inflam'dâwhich grief had partial sooth'd to rest. Lewis could scarce his anguish'd silence hold, While Madison his heart with softness told: âAnd, Proctor, art thou of affections void? Thy thirst for blood, for murder must be cloy'd. Have you no aged sire, offspring, wife, on earth; No mother's lap, that nurs'd thee from thy birth? Think, think them butcher'd by a savage foe, Full in thy sight, to rack thee with their wo! Would not wild frenzy seize upon thy brain To mark their throes,âtheir dying, shrieking pain? Would not the sight asunder rend thy heart, And tear the life-chords of thy soul apart? âMethinks thine eye reveals a passion meek; The blush of mercy mantles in thy cheek! And do I scan a tear? Show mercy, then; O spare the remnant of our wounded men! A guard, O send, with humane Reynolds brave, From ruffian violence their lives to save! Cawataw oft declar'd with aspect grim, That, on the morrow, in their blood he'd swim! âO, I conjure thee, by yon righteous heavenâ By all the sacraments to virtue givenâ By all the honours of illustrious fameâ By all on earth that hath a tender name,â To stay the purpose of the savage race, And be thy heart new strung with infant grace. âI would ask favour for ourselvesâbut noâ Give them all mercy that thy heart can show.â While thus his soul was pouring from the chief, Each eye reveal'd a sympathetick grief. Proctor sigh'd counterfeit, as though in pain For those unhappy in the marching slain. At length his voice came forth: âThine every word Transfix'd my bosom, like a pointed sword. 'Twas thy defence excited me to wrath, And hence, I loos'd the wild men on thy path; But now, in tears, I kneel before my God, To wash my soul, made crimson by their blood. âCast off this gloom. Yea, future, you shall find, That melting mercy hath renew'd my mind. Soon as I can make tame their savageness, My soul will joy to lighten your distress. Known are your crying wants; food you shall have; Be of good cheer! begone these looks so grave! Coverings, soft-wove, to shelter you, remain; These will I hasten, to remove your pain; To rest your limbs, I couches will provide; Yea, as my brothers, you shall here abide, Till shall your country your bright names redeem, And you return beyond the parting stream. Ere Time completes th' unwinding of an hour, You'll find yourselves beyond the savage power. âThis to prepare, I leave you; and to send Transports to Raisin, misery to befriend, Reynolds shall forth away; ere day shall cease, He shall depart to give their bosoms peace. And surgeons, skill'd in battle, shall be there To balm their wounds, and heal them with their care.â This he, with hypocritic tears, express'd, Mix'd with deep sighs, the mockery of his breast. So, with feign'd anguish, weeps the crocodile, While basking on the banks of Egypt's Nile; Yea, while his tears in copious torrents roll, Fell deeds of murder harbour in his soul; Or, like a Judas, rioting in blood, Whilst leaning on the bosom of his God: Thus wept the monster-manâand bade farewell; His heart still burning with the flames of hell. O'erpower'd with thought, the sufferers speechless stood, Pondering the cause, that balm'd his rancorous blood. Now hope and fear, altern, their souls possess'dâ Gladden'd by that, by this subdu'd, depress'd; Their fear, a cloud, by midnight tempest driven, Now blots their star of hope, then leaves it bright in heaven. Lewis at length: âWhen man hath once deceiv'd, His best of truth is with a doubt believ'd; How must it be with him who hath defil'dâ Yea, mock'd at lifeâthe laws of heaven revil'd? What must we think? Should Proctor weep, till dry The fountains of his eyes, he'd lack sincerity: For when that man is headlong plunging down The dismal path of infamous renown, The virtue then, his fell career to stay, Must reign supreme, so hard is the assay: Can Proctor thus be chang'd? with blood so dy'd, That not his equal on the earth beside? His promisesâthey never will be sent; His callous mind to different views is bent. âHe look'd, he utter'd, though he meant sincereâ And oft I mark'd the starting of a tear; But then a character, so vile at heart, Is qualified to act a demon's part, Or with defeated hopes the breast to wring, Or the soul torture with deception's sting. âSmiles, sighs, and tears, Hypocrisy assumes,â The robes of beauty, in which Virtue blooms,â With surer fate his victim to allure, And make his prey of innocence secure. âHis tone of voice with such bland accent flow'd, My heart beat musical; my feelings glow'd; So eager is the mind, when sore distress'd, If prospects brighten, to presume the best: But let us hopeful on our God rely; He can make light this load of misery.â His reasoning sunk with deepness in the mind, And each with silent tear to heaven resign'd. By this, the hypocrite had reach'd his place At which, in swarming numbers, were the race, Whose joy is murder. Scalps, yet moist with blood, They spread before him in their savage mood. With hell inspir'd, he grins a ghastly smile To mark the horrid vastness of the pile; As down they cast them to receive their gain, He looks a devil, compass'd by his train. Cawataw rude begins: âBrother, behold The death of victimsâvaluable for gold! This white thin-hair'd, me seiz'd in his decay, Tottering with yearsâthe sunset of his day.â Her breasts were doves, from whom these locks I tore.â These grape-vine curls the young Kentuckians wore.â This, on the path, me open'd with my knifeâ Sharp bladeâher red cheek smooth, all hot with life, Me seiz'd the squirming infant in the bloodâ Their sunder'd limbs lie scatter'd in the wood.â Proctor with smiles the cannibal address'd, Which show'd the poisoning venom of his breast: âYour deeds are worthy of your ancient name; You'll never die, but live with me in fame. Great is your knowledge in the healing art; By certain charms, you take away the smart. Scarce one, that bled, have you conducted o'er, But heal'd them, on the way, of every sore. In this, Tecumseh far do you excel; Too timid he, of remedies, that kill. âAnd now for those at Raisin you'll return; And if they bleed, you'll have their wounds to burn. Elliot hath started in advance before; At the Rock-valley, he awaits your power; You'll join him ere you feast. Forth speed away; From thence, move early at the night's decay.â He ended flourishing. The monsters grin, Gnashing their teeth, which tells their thoughts within. From Proctor's hand the price of blood is givenâ Outrageâviolence to earth and heaven! Howling like wolves o'er graves, they file away Just at the farewell of departing day. Proctor communes alone: âAnd now is gone The promis'd guard; my full intentions done! Thus I to them protection do afford; For this same purpose did I pledge my word. By tears, well feign'd, they, confident, believe I'd no design their prospects to deceive. They now expect, that I should succour bring; But soon I'll teach them to degrade my king! I've rais'd their hopes on tiptoe's pivot high, To wring their hearts with keener agony. The disappointment, urg'd with hunger's pain, Must cause a burning frenzy of their brain. âI spoke of kneeling to my God in tears: I wonder if a God upholds the spheres? Chance props the universe! the rest, a lie. A breathless nothing is the Deity! âMethinks I see Tecumseh, Reynolds, Muirâ The sight of whom not well can I endure Fast they approach. To shun them I'll retire; To me not pleasant are their looks of ire.â Thus spoke the infidel, and sunk away, Fearing the chiefs his conduct would inveigh. Thus a lov'd offspring through a garden hies, Attracted there by gold-dropp'd butterflies, Tasting the sugar dew upon the rose, Or the sweet breath, that from the lilach flows; She spies an adder in its wanton play, All shining, glossy with the sunny ray, And leaves the butterflies to view the snakeâ It charms bewitchingly, her life to take; For, while it charms, it poisonous whets its teeth To sting the infant with envenom'd death,â Behold, her parent through the alley strays, And marks the reptile in its fatal gaze! He dashes forth to seize upon his child; Back slinks the serpent in the thicket wild: So, at the passing of Tecumseh's form, Proctor slunk back, more poisonous than the worm. Now has the storm-charg'd north outspent its power; Wasting by parts, subsides the snowy shower; The silver-frozen mist, flake after flake, Plays with light wing above the crystal lake. As fairies dance before the moonlight beam, So dance the snow-drops o'er the glassy stream. The lake, delighted, ripples to a smile, Sweet to enchant them to its breast the while. With melting lips they, fluttering, kiss the deepâ Are goneâlost in the bosom of the lake they sleep. Thin fly the clouds. A streak of heaven's rich blue Lines the white hills with living sapphire new; Yet smother'd is the sun. But now, behold, The cloud folds up to drink his fluid gold. Earth seems in loveliness with heaven to vie, Such sudden glory burnishes the sky. The snow-crown'd hils, that wave along the east, Smile like divinity, with beauty grac'd. At length the sun recedes below the brim Of ocean's deep; yet still the clouds, that swim Smooth on the breath of heaven, imbibe his rays, And backward seem, like deities, to gaze, Quivering with transport at his holy light, Till far he vanishes beyond the sight. As fading twilight passes down the sky, Hesper appears with love's inviting eye; Her sister stars with virgin radiance glow, And shine and sparkle on the diamond snow; Creation slumbers in sweet silence still, Save the far murmur of the purling rill. Calm sleeps the deer, beneath his sheltering rock, On leaves that autumn scatter'd from the oak. Air, earth, and heaven, are hush'd in peace serene, Save savage monsters in the shape of men. With step unheard, the prowling clan draw near, Where faithless Elliot and his guards appear. They pass a narrow glen, two hills between, Where none but wild things of the wood had been. No word is utter'd;âgrim, in savage mood, With druling mouths, they hasten with their food. The fire Cawataw strikes; the quickening spark Smokes on the leaves; bright flashing through the dark, The blaze leaps into life; o'er which are plac'd The ready vessels to prepare the feast. The gore-fill'd caldrons soon with bubbling rise, Which forth they drew from deep-pierc'd arteries; The morsels next are added to the blood, Which to their carrion taste is dainty food: Liver of wolf, by smoke of victims dry'd, That gorging on the flesh of lambs had died; The gizzard of a vulture; condor's claw, Destroy'd while feasting on the slain in war; A midnight raven; lizard; serpent's head; A screech-owl's tongue, that scream'd o'er tombs fresh made; A tiger's heart, that bursted in its rave, Digging a culprit from his gibbet grave. Brains, from the skulls of captives crush'd in wrath, Are seen in fragments floating with the froth; Eyes, from the casements rent of beauty fair, Look set and ghastly, like a maniack stare; Young budding bosoms toss below the streams, Burnt off with heated wires 'mid death's expiring screams; The tongues of unwean'd infants; feet and hands, On which deep marks appear of corded bandsâ Round as they stir them with their bloody knife, The fingers bend, as though they still had life! The steam ascending, in thick volumes crowds The spectred valley, curtains it with clouds. Deep o'er the hills the gloom extends afar, And hides the sparkles of each golden star. Owls, wolves, and panthers, snuff the scented dead, And raise lone howlings in the caverns dread. Pale passing ghosts around the fire are seen Of murder'd infants, virgins, hoary men; Some without heads, distorted with despair, While others flit along with skull-bones bare. Some are cleft open, walking round about; And some look strangled, with their eyes burst out! So dread the scene, so dire the wild things yell, Forth from the mountain comes the Power of hell. His course, in night, was like a frightful star, Portending famine, pestilence, or war. To aid his views, Tecumseh's form he took, But not the usual mercy in his look. He yell'd a death-shriek,âand at once the sky Appear'd to start, so dread was the reply. And now, in readinessâthe sign he gives, And each divided band his part receives. After the savage style, they gloomy seat In silent circles, and begin to eat. With loathsome glee they scoop the horrid food, And smear their faces with the staining blood. Like shapes that people hell, they grim appear; The rugged rocks affected seem with fear! The fires, reflected from their features, cast A dubious glare; like spectres of a blast, When seated on a cloud in midnight storm, The lightning glimpses marking out its form. The monster cannibals begin to feel Soon the effects of their infernal meal. They raise the songâthe horrid dance begin, While the rank gore their bowels burns within. Like fiends unchain'd, with frantick gestures dire, They circle hideous, shouting round the fire. Their eyes start outward from their casements full, As though a maniack serpent gnaw'd their skull. The dance subsides:âthey settle round the flames, To give short respite to their tired frames. At sign, they startle upâthe scene renewâ A horrid sight!âtheir features strangled blue! Thus, through the night, by turns they rest and yell, Eclipsing deeds, the damn'dest deeds of hell. So Norway's whirlpool, when withdraws the flood, Begins its thunder in a frightening mood, Loud as hell anvils, when the furies pound; Or earthquakes, bursting from the rock-ribb'd ground. With rising wrath, reverberates the roar, As though the props of nature were no more; The mighty depths come rushing from the pole; The mouth of death sucks down the ocean whole. The waters ebb:âit slumbers, placid, still,â Smooth as a lake, or gently flowing rill. Behold, the floods return! it chafes the same, And jars, with deafenings dire, earth's pillar'd frame: Thus, intermitting through the night of death, They foam, and madden, and regain their breath. At length, the paling of the clouds to gray Proclaims the progress of the night's decay. They start for Raisinâhideous mark'd with goreâ Elliot advancing with his troop before. Meantime the wounded, at the stream behind, With trembling, listen'd to the flickering wind; Fearing the lurking savage would return To plunder, massacre, or village burn. But now, at dawn, an infant hope revives Their bosoms, that they'll shun a sacrifice; Their eyes they rivet on the Malden path To view their safety from the savage wrath. At length, the scarlet vestment they descry, Bright as a rainbow in the evening sky. As this gave promise from a drowning flood, So that is hope against the race of blood. Each fibre of their heart a gladness thrillsâ A tear of transport every vision fills. Thus a scarr'd warrior, on the sanguine plain, Through a long night convulses with his pain; Each heavy moment magnifies his wo, And no relief is offer'd by his foe. He burns, he parches with his fever's rage, Without a draught his anguish to assuage; Anxious he looks to see the fountain come To raise him, fainting, sinking in the tomb. He looks in vainâdespair casts down his eyeâ Behold, at length, he marks the blessing nigh! He feels new lifeâhis hands stretch longing forthâ He lifts his head with pleasure from the earth. While heaven sublimes his eye, he kens the bowlâ A gladdening impulse dancing through his soul: Not a less joy their suffering bosoms thrill'd, When they th' approaching of the guard beheld. But lo! a hectick flush'd their pallid cheek, When they, remote, heard Elliot's voice to speak, Bidding his band at distance to remain, Till he should mark what captives were in pain. This done,âhe slow advanc'd, with sorrowing look, To Woolfork, Hart, he counterfeiting spoke: âHow bleeds my bosom to behold you here, Gash'd with unseemly wounds, in grief severe! To yield you peace, thus early have I comeâ To guard you forth, and shelter you with home.â Were seraph harps in symphony to join Prelusive to the song of heaven divine; Were all the hallow'd tones of musick sweet In one rich concord meltingly to meet, Not more of rapture would the strain impart, Than Elliot's voice, that sounded on the heart. At length, thus Woolfork: âElliot, O my soul Gladly would speak what speechless feelings roll Deep in my bosom here! It seems my tongue Could strike at once in some celestial song! While thus you feel to succour the distress'd, How rich must flow the current of your breast! Yea, more delightsome than the vernal gale, Breathing sweet life upon the flowering vale; Yes, more divineâ âWhat issues from the wood? The wilderness in arms! horrid with blood! This way they bend their steps with banner red! Preserve us, Heaven! from immolation dread!â The sudden terrour paralyz'd his tongue; But Hart, his school-friend, in deep troubles young, Assay'd to touch his breast with former years, And soon he brought the crocodile to tears: âNow, Elliot, prove thy heart! expand thy soul! On thee, alone, our eyes for succour roll. Excuse our fears, though plighted is thy word, That thou to us wilt every aid afford. âThink of those hoursâO think when we were boys, Where holy friendship scatter'd all her joys! Revive that tenderness, when, late at school, Where both our hearts were join'd, and soul met soul! O cherish now those days of pleasure fled; Think of the flowers that bloom'd beneath our tread! Our youthful arms have oft each bosom twin'd; Our tender hearts one sacred rivet join'd. Oft have you smil'd around my father's board, And feasted large on what the heavens afford. Now, that I'm cast and wounded in thy power, Recal to memory that happy hour! Protect the lives of these ill-fated men; O, it is thine to stay a murderous scene! Thouâthou alone the savages canst calm; Behold, they wait the signal of alarm! O, answer me my prayers! Their wrath suppress, And unborn millions will thy memory bless! âBy all the hallow'd vows, to friendship given; By all that's holy, or on earth, or heaven; By every sympathy that melts the heart,â O blunt the murder of the savage dart! âMine eyes drop tears: but think not, Elliot, now, That for myself these streams of sadness flow; Behold this image of a beauteous flower! Alas, for her rains down this briny shower! Her heart will break to hear my funeral madeâ By savage hands, whose luxury is blood! âO, Mary! hush that sigh! I come, my love, I comeâ The generous Elliot saves me from the tomb!â He chok'd with grief; his eyes abundant flow'd; His pale cheek glisten'd with the lucid flood: So gushing fountains bathe a marble rock, Bright trickling down to join the silver brook. The weeping waters form a glittering spray, In which young rainbows in their beauty play. Deep the solemn pause. Elliot, with a sigh, Affected grief, and utter'd this reply: âI'm charg'd with being traitor to my soil; But from the slander doth my soul recoil. No: heaven, all-merciful, hath sent me now To guard my brothers from the ruthless foe: Like Joseph, barter'd for Egyptian ore, To save his kindred from a famine sore. A dear-beloved Benjamin art thou; How sweet to pay the gratitude we owe! âBut look! the wild men in their rage press on; I'll stay their wrath, then guard you as my own.â This saidâHe wheel'd to meet the hideous foe, That then had started from the woods below. With hasty marching to their front he drew; But when Tecumseh's counterfeit he knew, Appall'd he stood, his virtues tower'd so high, He strove to shun him like an enemy. The Fiend, mistrusting what was his design, Advanc'd to meet him in an oblique line; And thus, deceptive, he: âI once was calmâ But now I'm darkâbig thunder is my arm! I spare no more. Full be my soul of deathâ I bare their skullsâburnâstrangle out their breath!â While this was said, joy brighten'd Elliot's mind, And thus he urg'd him what his soul design'd: âThy tongue, Tecumseh, I rejoice to hear; 'Tis far more sweet than musick to my ear. âLead to the massacre! nor do not fail To spare one life, with tears to tell the tale. Think of your wrongs; the booty, you'll acquire To glut your people with their souls' desire. Let naked skulls be seenâlet flames ariseâ Let none scowl on me with their hateful eyes! Cawataw is impatient, I perceive; Suppress him not their being to bereave. Somewhat I fear, your softness will return To check his fury when they frying burn. âGo forth, Tecumseh; I yon height shall hold, To see thy wrath in majesty unfold. 'Twill gratify me well to view the blast, Searching their life, and hear them shriek their last. Their scowling virtues wilderness my brain; Lift not the hatchetâlengthen out their pain.â Hot from his throat, a gory foam was seen, As though at savage feasting he had been. With step uncouth he hied him to the wood To mark the streaming of his country's blood. Th' Infernal stood, his eye upon him bent. At length, unheard, he breath'd this sentiment: âRipe is your soul to plunge with us below, Where traitors dwell, fetter'd in chains of wo. But you, ingrate, shall on your back be bound; Ten giant furies on your heart shall pound; Or you shall labour at the lake severe, And hear a musick to delight your ear.â This utter'd to himself, he rais'd a yell, Which seem'd to echo from the gate of hell. The wild men, rushing, answer with a roar, Loud as mad streams, which down the mountains pour. With savage violence they rush for prey, Like black clouds whirling in their stormy way. So cougars, raving, from their dens come forth, To prowl upon the tender things of earth; They meet a flock, unshepherded, in fear, That shrink and tremble as their death draws near: Thus, foam the monsters, thus the wounded lay; Those thirst for blood, these see their dying day. Their hands are working death! Groans echo groans; From breasts, beat through, ascend expiring moans. Hark! a fresh scream brings murder to the ear; Another shrieks with lengthening pang severe. Blood smokes around. The best of Freedom faint; Live hearts leap agoniz'd from bosoms rent! The race of hell thick bathe themselves in gore; Brains dash on every side, and life is heard no more! Greaves and MacCracken, striving from their bed, Receive a blow upon their breast and head. They fall with outstretch'd hands, all marr'd with blood; Their eyes in spasm roll, then close in death's deep shroud. Tekelah, meeting with sad Hickman now, Strong with his battle-axe makes sure his blow. Beneath his ear the narrow blade went in; Fierce as he struck, the hilt made bare his chin. From sunder'd arteries swift the life-streams leap; The warrior slumbers in eternal sleep. And now they ply the torch! Flames mount to heaven; With darts of fire the patriot souls are riven! Drinking the blaze; twisting in wreaths they die, Stung to the heart with rack of agony. With painful effort, Dun, with fractur'd thigh, Creeps from the flames, and pleads with melting sigh. But lo, they seize the beardless boy with ire, And drag him back, and cast him in the fire! One shriek is heard above the varying cries; See, see his body, how it writhing fries! His hands are lock'd tight inward on his breast, As though his heart were sweating blood distress'd! The flames approach where Hart exhausted lies; Woolfork assays to bear him from their eyes. Cawataw comesâgrasps Woolfork by the hair; His red eyes rolling with infernal glare; He hurls the crippled warrior on the plain; Strips his skull piecemeal to augment his pain; Applies live embers to the bleeding part, Which makes the warrior writhe beneath the smart. Amid the agonies, with which he wrung, The monster shakes him till he gets his tongue, And tears it out; and, while he sweats and throes, Severs his fingers to increase his woes. Then plucks hir eyes; the sockets fills with fire, And leaves him lingering, dreadful to expire! The Fiend beheld, and shudder'd at the scene; For worse than fiends are wild ferocious men! Big tears of ice roll down from either eye; He waited not to see the martyr die, But sought the bosom of a cloud, at hand, Which soon convey'd him to his mountain stand. What time that Woolfork suffer'd on the snow, At Hart, Tekelah aim'd no second blow; Hart dodg'd the axe, by watching of his eye, Which, whirring, pass'd his marble temples by: Thus to the chieftain: âSuffer me to live, And I bright silvers will twice fifty give. This shall be yours; besides, I gifts will make, If thou wilt guard and bear me o'er the lake.â Tekelah heard, and dropp'd his threatening arm, And answer'd mild: âI not your life will harm. Bestow these treasures, I conduct you there, To Reynolds good, and nourish you with care.â This said: He gently aided him to horse, And bent towards the lake in silent course, Leaving his brother chiefs to burn and kill, Till they of blood should satisfy their will. Now hope is seen to brighten in his eye, Like sunbeams glittering from an open sky; Yet his heart trembles, when reflections rise Of glancing death, that pass'd his swimming eyes. It seems, his blood to curdling ice congeals; It seems, in thought, the whirring axe he feels. As when a peasant, sweeping down the plainâ Or, in the harvest, sickling yellow grain,â Espies a serpent coil'd among the grass With tumid crest,âto make the fatal pass,â He starts aside; but, at the instant, lo, The worm of death, to give a poisonous blow, Leaps at his heel, without protection bare,â But, by the start, he passes it a hair; The snake, recoiling, fearfully retires Swift o'er the field in serpent-gliding spires: Yet stands the swain immoveable with dread, As though the reptile's tooth had fang'd him dead: So Hart's imagination seems to mark The death-axe, glancing by his temples dark. Cawataw, done for Woolfork, rais'd to smite The feeble Hart beneath his savage might; Still his mind held him by his fractur'd knee, Where Hart was wounded. Fix'd at the spot, impossible to flee; Hence, without thought, he rais'd his hand to cast The youth to torture, till he groan'd his last; Hard denting on his palm his fingers close, For nought was there, their griping to oppose. Missing his object in the rescu'd Hart, His blood was liquid flame! through every part, He bellow'd for his prey: Not otherwise a bear, Robb'd of her young, while absent from her lair, Foams in her fury; eyeballs, rolling fire, Shooting the arrows of unsparing ire; Stiffens her hair; bellows; gnashes her teeth; Her look is pregnant with the stroke of death: Cawataw thus. At length, bending his eyes On the lake path, Tekelah, Hart, he spies. With hell upon his breast, he dashes forth; Blood, dripping from the fiend, distains the earth! He shuns the road direct, but skims the plains, And thus advantage of the distance gains. Beyond them pass'd, he wheel'd upon his course, And meets them like a blast, and checks the horse! Like some fair star, that for a moment burns, Then, gone forever, and to darkness turns, So hope flew Hart, when fell Cawataw came, And seiz'd the curb with eyeballs roll'd in flame! Tekelah now: âDown place your tomahawk! Stayâstay your arm, and hear a brother talk! Grant him his life; to Malden bear him o'er; Silvers, twice fifty, will he give, and more. Then, generous, I'll divideâme keep the leastâ And that shall be devoted to a feast.â This suited not Cawataw: âSay you thus? Twice fifty only for his life from us? The tongue of white man double actions speak; Me drink his blood, and all he have me seek.â He rais'd his hatchet in the act to throwâ But Hart with artful speech suppress'd the blow: âBrother, but half that treasure I've in hand; The rest I buried secret in the sand, Which now is cover'd with this depth of snow; But bear me hence, and I the spot will show. Now if I'm slain, then who will find the place, Where lie the treasures to enrich your race? âI have a father, with a head like snow; Think how his tears adown his cheeks will flow! He'll fade, a wither'd oak; no son but me To cheer him through his days of misery! âO think your sonâthe last of all your race, No more to bear your burden in the chaseâ Alas! cut off in youth by timeless deathâ Sudden, convuls'dâcold stretch'd upon the heathâ Never, no neverââ Th' savage smote him sore, Which broke his teeth, and lips all piteous tore In ragged strings away! âDieâdie you must! I feel me dry! me drink your blood for thirst! My brothers, frequent, have you made expireâ Me dig your heartâme make you slow roast fire!â While this was said, he wrench'd him from his horse, And dragg'd him to a pine with maniack force. Cruel, with double thongs, he bound him tight, Then, gather'd fagots, death's sharp fire to light. But first he pierc'd a vein upon his arm, And suck'd his blood with thirsting vengeance warm! Then, from the flint he beat the secret fire; Th' unsparing flames around the youth aspire! Hart turns his body as augments the heat, Whilst the rack'd fibres of his arteries beat, Quivering with pain! The engine of his life Leaps with the agony of death in strife! His groans are answer'd from the sighing woodâ The monster smiling at his frying blood! With gestures dire, he strikes the dance and song; The note of hell breaks deafening from his tongue! Tekelah mark'd him in his devious track, And when at favour'd time he turn'd his back, With lifted axe he smote the sufferer's headâ With shiv'ring gasp, he join'd the martyr'd dead! Thus in the morn, an opening flower is seen, With dew-drops glittering to the sun serene; But lo! at noon, its charms the scythe deface, And all is vanish'd of its former grace; Yet, though its beauty die upon the plain, Its incense livesâits odours still remain. So liv'd young Hartâso wither'd he in fire; But virtue's incense never can expire. The work of death is done. No more sharp screams Are heard to echo mid the piercing flames. Elliot and chiefs, with treasure weighted down, Repass the lake to reach the Albion town. Malden. And groups of Indians measure back the road; Their hands and faces coated thick with blood. And numbers scattering, linger on their rear, Till night rolls down her dungeon shadows drear. Where shall the poet end the direful theme? His heart drops blood at sight of Raisin's stream. Of unheard anguish are their sufferings, E'en to bring tears from eyes of cruel things! Now in the sight of Albion's flag, behold The bleeding captives by the savage sold! The horrid scene how maddening to the brain! To civil man how deep the damning stain! Britain, alas! is civiliz'd no more; She wades in blood, and drinks the captives' gore; Suffers her fiends to barter them away; None a kind blessing offering, to allay The sinking bosoms of the patriots brave; In vain they ask a charitable grave! Ye lovely daughters of Columbia, fair! How often have ye smooth'd the warrior's care! Your tender bosoms heave an aching sighâ A pity, born of heaven, weeps brimming in your eye! Stretch'd are your hands your brothers to redeem, Whilst round their souls, as light, your actions beam. And, Woodward, thou in memory shalt live; Thy worth demands more praise than I can give. Rich in thy bosom is the blest reward, More sweet than poet's numbers can afford. Yet, while on earth, receive my feeble lay, Till heaven shall open with a flood of day. Now lingers sad the Muse on Raisin's shore, Where all the dead lie frozen in their gore! The holy rite of burial is denied; They mangled lie, where they like martyrs died! The vultures come and tear away their flesh! A strangling horrour binds my soul afresh! My heart is burnt with pain; nor can I trace The sickening theme. Death-paleness shrouds my face; I reel with anguish drunk. My mind is lost; I'm but the shadow of a moon-lit ghost. Are these the clouds of night? My breath returns Shortâpantingâweak. My lamp of life faint burns. Ye passing Spirits of the murder'd dead! What floods of anguish o'er your tombs are shed! Beneath the cypress bower, Columbia stands, Vailing her eyes with alabaster hands. Your hoary sires,âyour brothers circle round, And hapless mothers with deep grave-weeds bound. Your sisters stoop, like fading lilies low; Your orphans shriek the frenzied shriek of wo. Dumb stands your widow'd wife, like marble grief; No silver tear-drop comes to her relief. High in the wind, dishevelled flies her hair; She smilesâdistracted is her reckless air. Ah! now she beats her bosom in her woâ She faintsâshe fallsâcold as a wreath of snow! Spirit of Hart! behold thy sorrowing Fair, In ice-cold paleness, sinking in despair! Mild, as lamb meeknessâbeautiful as heaven; But all her soul to cankering grief is given. Her breasts of pearl, like foam on chafing sea, Swell and recede with throes of agony. Silent, at night she marks the moon's pale beam, While down her cheeks unconscious fountains stream! Translated band! 'Tis not for you we mourn; For ye, through death, have reach'd the heavenly bourn; 'Tis for ourselves we lengthen out the sigh; O let it not disturb your ecstacy! Columbia! weep, O weep thy tears no more; Resign to heaven; with humble awe, adore. Soon shall thy sons put off their robes of clay, And clasp their kindred in immortal day! END OF VOL. I. VOL. II. CANTO XI. CRUISE OF CAPTAIN PORTER. ARGUMENT. Invocation .... In consequence of the calamities at Raisin, offensive operations are deferred until the return of Spring ..... The sailing of the Essex .... Capture of the Alert .... Porter returns .... refits .... sails for the Pacifick .... enters the Port of Valparaiso .... Porter is there discovered by the PhÅbe and Cherub .... Neutral Rights .... The PhÅbe in the power of the Essex .... The Challenge violated by the Enemy .... The Blockade .... Porter, with a favouring wind, endeavours to gain the ocean .... Defeated by a gale carrying away his main-top-mast .... The British pursue him into the Harbour, and commence Action. The scene is laid at the above-mentioned place. The time is about ten months: from the commencement of the War, June 18th, 1812, until the Spring of 1813. From the time the Essex enters Valparaiso, till the day of Battle, is forty-six hours. Vouchsafe, ethereal Muse! from heaven, O deign To bend thine ear, and hearken to my strain: Thou, who inspir'st the poet to receive That hallow'd impulse, which not earth can give! Come, and bestow thy musick to my song; Sublime my thoughts to noble musings strong. O let me feel thee through each vein of life, That I may madden in the maddening strife. O for a spark that Homer did inspire, That I may burn, and feel myself on fire! Virgilian sweetness to my verse impart, To charm with beauty, and dissolve the heart: Let Shakspeare's fancy, with his frenzied eye, Rush on my soul, and waken raptures high! With Milton's majesty exalt my song; Teach me to speak with his immortal tongue! Like Ossian, solemn; like his eagles, bold; And let the flood-gates of the mind unfold! Wherefore, O Muse! so partial to the East, That thou hast there, so lavish, spread thy feast; While stinted favours, granted to the West, Seem to be drawn reluctant from thy breast? What! is the rising of the sun to thee More sweet, than when with golden drapery The heavens are hung, he, with soft light, retires, And fills the soul with worshipping desires? Or art thou human, to admire the spot Where thou, with dewy wings, wert first begot? Impartial Muse! let not these feelings bland Enchain thee longer to the orient strand. Come, view our sun; he sets in love-scenes bright; His evening beauty will thy heart delight. Our lakes, our rivers, and our mountain clime Will give thy soul its fancy-work sublime. But, if these nothing will thy bosom move To grant the West the smiling of thy love, With other motives must I urge my suit; For I,âno, never,ânever can be mute; O come, and spread thy pinions o'er the sea, And thou shalt find thy sister, Liberty! Through various trials, changes, have I pass'dâ O still uphold me till I sing the last! From hell to earthâfrom earth I venturous trod To gain the outskirts of creation's God; The shock, the turbulence of battle, sung, Where Death his harvest glean'd, whilst pealing thunders rung. Three parts remain to sing! Without thine aid, My soul must languish,âfuture scenery fade. I shrink with trembling, when I look before, Ere the last numbers of my song be o'er. O mount my thoughts on inspiration's wing! Vouchsafe thy wisdom, or I faultering sing. On the same morn of the disastrous day, Which wrapp'd the martyrs in their robes of clay, Shelby commanded Croghan from his rest, And him, like father to a son, address'd: âThy youthful warriors marshal, and proceed To strengthen Lewis at his pressing need. His heart, all anxious, palpitates with pain To meet the foe, progressing on the plain. Adair will reach us at declining sun; Malden submits ere three brief days are done.â Croghan departed instant from the fort; But soon from Rumour he receiv'd report Of Lewis' hasty movement from the Isle; Presque Isle. Then of the battle; how, with courteous smile, Vict'ry had crown'd his efforts. An hour hence, He learnt the slaughter of the dire defence; Of Allen, steep'd in gore; of Simpson's grave; And slaughter'd multitudes of heroes brave. Lo, now, a hurrying villager he spies, Bearing a wild expression in his eyes, Who brief describes the massacre of death, Deliver'd quick in violence of breath. âI'll hunt the savage in his den! My God! What, have the monsters rioted in blood? Graves, Dunn, MacCracken, Woolfork, Hickman, Hart! Lead me the way! With life shall none depart; I'll wall their path with dead. My heart's last drop Shall be expended! Wherefore do we stop?â âYoung chief, most gladly would I show you forth; But see the snow! how deep upon the earth! You ne'er can hope these pil'd-up drifts to pass; Return you must, from whence your coming was. Admit that, even now, you'd reach'd the plain, What good relief could you afford the slain?â âAlas! what tightness binds my breast! Thy voice Is coldâtoo cold! And nothing left for choice? Nothing. My reason tells me I should fail; YeaâI to Shelby must declare the tale; A tale, to strike the centre of his heart, Sharp as the piercing of a heated dart.â Silent he wheel'd his grieving warriors round, Their features, solemn, cast upon the ground; Sad they their path retravers'd through the snow; And Croghan, tearful, spoke the words of wo. While Shelby heard his voice, he stood, a block Of statued marble,âpillar'd by the shock. And when th' expression of his tongue was heard, A sigh came mingled with each frozen word: âI pray you, peace! nor tear my soul in twain; Declar'd you not, that every life was slain? And where was Elliot? said you not, that he Was leagu'd to aid the horrid butchery? O what unnatural sacrilege is this! What, burnt with torture in the wilderness! Dizzy my brainâmy heart, my heart is pent, Breaking oppress'd. What language, utterance, vents My breast, o'ercharg'd with grief. O, Britain! whatâ âForbear my tongue To utter forth her name. Oppressionâwrongâ Harder than flint-rockâsharpâcruel as fireâ Purchaser of bloodâall the vices dire, That ever brooding hell hatch'd into birth, She nurtures in her breastâthe damn'dest of the earth! She stabs, and smiling stabs! âWhile Raisin's flood Shall mingle with the lake, this martyr'd blood Will mark her forehead with a crimson stain, Which not the waters of the dark-blue main Can ever wash away! This scene of death Will rise in judgment from the world beneath! With blood branded with blood! âThe theme no moreâ My heart is bleedingâbreaking at the core!â The hoary chief stands fix'd in silence, dumb By the full passion of his soul o'er-come. Slow, partial by degrees, subside his pains; His mind, at length, its former power regains: So when the northern sea, in tumult thrown By the rude tempest of the frigid zone; Scaling the cloudy battlements of heaven, Thence to the basis of the ocean driven; The North outspent, the howling whirlwinds die, And the loose clouds are scatter'd o'er the sky; But not the billows sudden lose their force, Ascending, sinking, rolling in their course. At length, by parts, subsiding to a plain, A deep, dead silence settles on the main: Thus the commotion in the veteran's breast, By slow degrees, was quieted to rest. He thinks no longer to pursue the strife, Till a new spring shall blossom into life. Now iron Winter rules the northern sphere, Creation frowns with aged look severe, The trees stand bleak and naked on the plain, Their green robes scatter'd by the storms amain, Save the hard oaksâthese rustle in the sky, And the cold searching of the winds defy. With howling fury drives along the blast, While from his wings, ice, snow, and sleet, are cast; Drifts pil'd on drifts, deep smother up the earth, And hold in chains the hostile armies, north. The lakes, the streams, are smooth, with ice bridg'd o'er, Save where steep cat'racts down the rough rocks roar. The spires of ice, which glitter from on high, Reflect the clouds, which scud athwart the sky; Nature stands manacled. The frost so deep, It heaves the mountainsâwhirling fragments leap With sound through heaven, reverberating, loud, Like thunders bursting from a fire-ting'd cloud. Now Porter from the poet claims the songâ And while he sings, O Muse! inflame his tongue. The mariner demands superior lay; To live till things of eldest time decay. When War's rough clarion round Columbia rung, On board his gallant ship the hero sprung, The Essex, new with life; with power supplied; And all in naval trim to plough the tide To search the impressing foe. A fearless crew His voice obey'd, their glory to pursue. And these to Porter next in honour stood, To live recorded with the brave and good: Gamble, and Terragut, Downes, Boswick, Terry, And Isaacs, Barnwell, Lyman, Duzenbury, Linscott, Macknight, and Finchâwhom none excel, And Odenheimer, Johnson, Willner, and Cowellâ Names worthy Porter to command the crew, Or guide the battle-ship the ocean through. At Porter's voice, her wings reflect the day; She walks the waters with her streamers gay. Nereids sail round in shells of coral red, And bosom'd mermaids show their blushing head. All the fair deities, that cleave the deep, Dance to the motion of the tilting ship. Soon nine rich flags surrender to her powers; Before her path, abash'd, the Lion cowers; Light as a sea-bird o'er the water swims, So the proud vessel through the ocean skims. Mean time, Langharne, commanding the Alert, Travers'd the main, with royal feelings hurt, Seeking the ship, that had the Peacock tore, The blue wave crimson'd with her bosom's gore. Through mist, he now not distantly descried The Essex dark'd, which dimm'd her on the tide; Hence for the Hornet he her form mistook, And thus began, intent her power to brook: âThe saucy vessel, on the west espied, Must be the stately Hornet in her pride; Long have we sought to meet her in the strife, And sink her as she sunk the Peacock's life. Brief we'll repay, what she to us hath given, For down to death her standard shall be driven. Extend the canvass; bear upon her proud, And wake the thunder guns with vengeance loud.â Before th' impelling wind the vessel flew; For now the North with quickening impulse blew. The shrouds the Britons in their ardour mann'd, And shouted triumphs with a waving hand; Then on the deck descended with a run, And lit the matches, and the war begun. When Porter mark'd her bent upon the fight, He felt his bosom tremble with delight, And thus with smiling cheek: âLo, with what rage She leaps the sea, the Essex to engage! Mates! give not back, though terrible her ire; Behold, she comes to bury us in fire! With ready sparkle, touch the guns a side, And let our voice be heard upon the tide. 'Twill never do the horrible to shun, As cowards do and quail without a gun.â The sea-boys instant to the cannon ply The madding spark; the balls instinctive fly, Searching the enemy. From stem to stern The Albion groans, Death! so direful burns, Inflam'd, the Freedom ship. To shun the grave, Which yawning gapes below, flat on the wave The Cross in anguish sinks! The battle's done; A blazing moment, and the fight was won. The lofty Triton, at the edge of night, Beheld, but shunn'd the Essex in a flight; And Porter's signs, to bribe him to the fray, But urge him faster in his fear away. Having, at length, th' Atlantick circled round, And many a regal flag in ocean drown'd, For York he bent his sails, with smooth winds bless'd, His ship to furnish for the ocean west; But lo, he found two three-tier'd royals there; He run them by, and made the Delaware. During the voyage, no patriot found his death, But all return'd inspir'd with Freedom's breath. Ten days ashore, the boreal winds arise, And forth invite him to the southern skies; He weighs the deep-cast anchor; spreads his sail, And gains the oceanâbounds before the gale. Now in the south, beneath the solar ray, Columbia's ensign brightens with the day. The rapid Essex, on the twentieth morn, Doubles the continent at bleak Cape Horn; The stately bark rejoices in her way, Ploughing with crooked beak the western sea. The sign of Freedom she displays above, The oak-perch'd Eagle, thunder-bird of Jove. Proud from the centre floats her pennon high, Brushing the clouds, that sleep upon the sky. Broad waving from the fore, to glad their eyes, The âRights of Sailors,â like a gold cloud, flies. North, Porter traverses the Chilian coast, The softest climates, that the world can boast; Along the shores of Lima smooth he sails, Impell'd, delicious, by the spicy gales; Cruises from thence round Gallipagos Isles, Where nature frolicks in primeval wiles. On all his paths, he opens through the tide, None can his rapidness, or strength, abide: The Nocton, Greenwich, first their standards bow, Then Montezuma, king of Mexico; The Georgiana, Hammond, Policy; Th' Atlantick, deep with treasures of the sea; Seringapatam, Charlton, Catharine And Rose, and Hector, Zealander, resign. Of these he forms a fleet with Freedom's Star, And gilds the ocean with its light afar. To isles, unvisited, he bears his fame, And plants the Eagle in his country's name. At length, the Albions scatter'd from the west, No standard seen to bear the Lion's crest, For Valparaiso he directs his prow, And flies the ocean on his wings of snow. In three bright suns, he furls his sails in port, And drops his anchor opposite the fort. Not otherwise a whale, from northern flood, Bent on revenge for pouring forth of blood, Shed by the sharks, foams with excited wrath, Tinging the waters crimson in his path. The sharks endeavour to avoid his ire In vainâfull many by his blows expire; At length, outspent with labour on the wave, He seeks composure in his secret cave: The Essex left the sea; her view the same, To give soft quiet to her tired frame. The mean time Rumour to Britannia bore, Th' unwelcome tidings of the Essex' power, Which set the nation in commotion wild; The madded pulses of the monarch boil'd, The tooth of anguish eat upon his soul, That Porter, born of freedom, should control The ocean of the west: it made him rave To think the Essex should command the wave, And bid defiance to his thousand ships, Which late had borne the trident of the deeps. He sent for Hillyar, at the court of James, And Tucker, from their vessels on the Thames: The first, devoid of honour's guiding chartâ The latter, touch'd with virtue's silver dart. They came, unpausing, at their monarch's word, From whom these orders they in silence heard: âThe tidings know ye not? Forth, anchors weigh, And dash your vessels foaming through the sea, And hunt this Porter and the Essex down; Reduce the Eagle to the Lion crown; Pluck every quill from out her haughty wing; Tear, search her vitals; her destruction bring. By her, alone, more commerce have we lost, Than all the battles, wag'd with France, have cost. Who ever thought, their President would dare To send a vessel on the ocean there? No doubt was Ours, but, ere this period, all His infant navy in Our hands would fall; Of them, the whole had in the deep sea grav'd, And not an ensign of the Eagle wav'd. They must have watch'd us with unwinking eye, And, in night season, run Our vessels by. In darkness thick involv'd, their Hornet flew From port Salvador, pass'd the Montague; But soon, how soon did Brook their Lawrence slay, When proud he fought him in the midst of day! When We, in cruising, met the ships of Gaul, In night, or day, We caus'd their flags to fall. âSoon We the Tagus and Carnation fair, With Lloyd, shall send upon the station there, Perhaps Plantagenet to him shall give, That in your presence not a foe may live. âBring but the Essex here, or late, or soon, And We'll reward you with a monarch's boon.â Hillyar receiv'd th' intelligence with awe,â As though a deity had giv'n him law. Tucker, by look, consentedânever knelt, For in his breast a dignity he felt. They to their vessels presently repair, With flaunting standards sporting in the air. Hillyar the PhÅbe governs, deck'd with pride, With thirty guns to blaze upon a side. Engrav'd on each is seen the Cross and Crown. And Lion stamping with a kingly frown. Ready a crew of eight times fifty stand, Prompt to obey each signal of command. Bradburn stood next, the PhÅbe to defendâ A man, that never felt his soul to bend. Tucker the Cherub guides,âinferior force,â The PhÅbe's consort through the briny course. Brass twice fifteen, with four times fifty men, To wield their powers when battle shall begin, Compose her strength; each bosom in a glow To strike the banner of the Essex low. Hillyar commands for sailing: âAnchors rise! Unfurl the willing canvass to the skies! See every officer in station plac'd; We cleave the deep for the Pacifick waste. There rides a haughty shipâthe Essex proudâ 'Tis ours to fold her in a sulphur shroud, Which to our character will add more weight, Than to have swept from France her navy desolate.â Forthwith the hardy mariners proceed To weigh the anchors from their sandy bed; They urge the poising levers with a song, Which gives communion to their efforts strong, The ships inch slow, as they the windlass turn, Which makes the blood within their bosoms burn. At length, the flukes move heavy from the sand, While the loos'd canvass flutters in the hand Of those aloft. Dull-floating on the tide The prows swing sluggish with the stream aside. Fresh from the hills descend the infant gales, And fill with rustling sound the shivering sails. Like wearied labour travelling, move they slow; But soon the winds with stronger breathings blow; At once they feel their power, and cease to creep; They dart, they fly, they bound along the deep. Urg'd by the rapid wind, the Cape Cape Horn. they make, The Cherub foaming in the PhÅbe's wake. From every mast a jealous eye they keep To mark the conquering Essex on the deep. From south to north, the ocean round they cleave; But nothing, friend or enemy, perceive. Now south by east, in varying line, they steer, Till fanes of Valparaiso dim appear. Approaching, soon with envy's eye they view The Essex waving high the constant blue, Mix'd with red war, and innocence of white, Which Freedom gave Columbia with delight; Round which the Stars effulgent blaze sublime, That mark'd to Liberty the western clime. The royal vessels anchor'd, Tucker went To learn of Hillyar, how his views were bent, Who scornful thus began: âBehold the ship, That dar'd the ocean of the west to keep! It makes my very blood indignant rave To think such weakness should command the wave! Look, how her saucy standards flaunt the sky! See how supreme the Rights of Sailors fly! But presently we'll dash these streamers gay Back from the presence of the eye of day. These glittering emblems from their height shall fall, And Porter, kneeling, for protection call. âThe Cherub forth for combat you'll prepare; But first shall I upon the Essex bear, Prim'd for the battleâsettle on her sternâ These lofty banners in the deep o'erturn. âBut should there danger to the PhÅbe seem, By Essex veering, as to gain her beam, You'll place the Cherub opposite her bow, And there your art and naval valour show.â He open'd his design. And Tucker, grave, After deep pause, this prudent counsel gave: âWith reverence due, for your supreme command, Brief I'd remark, we sound a neutral strand, Where hostile flags in friendship can resort; Hence, a peace offering would I bear in port. The law of nations sanctifies the place; Let not our violence the right disgrace; 'Twill dim our honour to commit the deed, Yea, make the bosom of Britannia bleed. Scorn'd should we beâyes, scouted by the worldâ On every sea, where rides our flag unfurl'd. If we the laws annul, which nations bind, Where shall we hope an allied pow'r to find? Noânot a friend, except a savage horde To stain our banners with their deeds abhorr'd: Thus will our country ever spill its blood, So long as we shall violate the flood. For twice ten years, we've slumber'd not in peace; Continued wars have swept away our race; The cause is obviousâopen to the sightâ The intermeddling with the nations' right. Let but another Pitt direct the helm, And wide destruction will the Isle o'erwhelm. âBut I discern no shadow of a cause, That we should now annihilate those laws: Our strength outnumbers twice the Essex there, Hence, why should we like dastards on her bear? The ship can we imprison at our ease, Or let her pass, until she gains the seas, And then, by settling on her stern and prow, Cause her proud streamers on the deck to bow. âBut mark you not, she's anchor'd at the fort? Hence, should we hostile enter in the port, They might their fortress on our vessels play, And drive us backâour ships in disarray, Which sadly should we feelâfor now we need The sweetening fruits, our tainted blood to feed. âI, for these reasons, would maintain the peace, And, for the time, hostilities should cease. âWith voice unmuffled have I spoke my mind,â Nothing conceal'd in secret thought behind. With you it still remains to lead the way, Gentle in peace, or to provoke the fray. To you inferior, thy command is lawâ You'll find me valiant, if intent on war.â Thus he. And Hillyar thus: âFull well I know, That drops of honour in your bosom flow; But think you've awkwardly constru'd the right, On which, I doubt not, I can throw some light: âI know, that nations, formerly in wars, Were ever govern'd by establish'd laws, Call'd laws of nations; but these laws of yore, And ancient politicks, are now no more. In former days, blockade to constitute, Requir'd a force, the passage to dispute; But all that's now requir'd t' effect the thing, Are orders, sign'd and publish'd by the kingâ And fast imprison'd is the ocean worldâ At least, where Gallick standards are unfurl'd. âThe ancient law admitted neutral powers To commerce with bellig'rents, save in stores Hostile to lifeâbut now, 'tis not the law; If contraband, or article of war, Let them but enter France,âour vessels seize Such ships of wealth, and count them lawful prize! âBut let us closer to our purpose come, And trace the subject to our bosoms home: âYou apprehend, if we the Essex fight, That we should be the first to mar the rightâ There's nothing in it true. Did not our king Bestow on Nelson royal honouring, For entering Denmark's capital, from thence Seizing her navy in a time of peace? Poets the action sing; the tuneful Scott Exalts the theme with a melodious note! Did not our vessels plunder on the main, In the third year, 1803. the treasury ships of Spain? âNow these things justified, by modern rulesâ (All doctrines are despis'd of ancient schools,) Sure, right is ours, t' assail our enemy, Or moor'd in harbour, or on open sea. âYou apprehend, should we to war resort, The west Iberians would emblaze their fort, And drive us back to ocean in our need, And every purpose of the war impede: Groundless your thoughtsâthey dare not think the thing, So deep they dread the terror of our king; Our fleet would Copenhagenize each town, And with the torch burn every hamlet down. Put off these infant fears. No doubt is mine, But that the monarch lauds our bold design. What gifts of costly price he gave to Brook, When he the Chesapeake from Lawrence took. Never so splendid was a falchion made; His garments stiff with beaten gold o'erlaid. No English captain, since king Alfred's name, Has e'er been honour'd with an equal fame. âMy reasons now you fully comprehend, Hence you my every signal will attend. But conquer now the Essexâand, behold, At our return, we shall be laid with gold. I charge you, mark me wellâand should the foe Kindle her ire, be swift upon her bow!â Tucker, unanswering, to his ship repairs; And, while that Hillyar for the Essex bears, He makes his purpose known: âFor action, clear, And every Briton to his post be near. Port-lights conceal, till I the word proclaim, Then, like enchantment, open with the flame, By which, unguarded, we shall strike them through, And deep engulf them, where their death is due!â His coward purpose, glad his crew obey, As winds the PhÅbe in her treacherous way. Now when the royals bore themselves in sight, Porter prepar'd his vessel for the fightâ For, by appearances so oft deceiv'd, Now show of peace the mariner believ'd; And, as the PhÅbe glided down the stream, He plac'd her, artful, on the Essex' beam. This was the hero's voice: âThe Albion now Glides into port, with peace upon her browâ But light the matches, should her aspect lower, To show the hidden virtue of our power; But should she hold as sanctified this ground, I'll be the last to speak the hostile sound.â Scarce had he ended, when a sudden blast, Down drove the PhÅbe on the Essex fast! Hillyar's knee-joints, unhing'd from their control, Shook with a palsy, which subdu'd his soul. To move, unableâready to expire, Through dread, that Freedom would explode her fire. While Hillyar thus was apprehending death, Downes came to Porter with a hurried breath, That he would signal give, to blaze her throughâ Urg'd to request from th' impatient crew: âLo, your commands the mariners await, To touch the match, her life to desolate: Say, that the sparkle shall the cannon burst, And, at the word, the enemy is dust!â Porter made answer: âHonour is the chart, Which, till eternity, should guide the heart; Let not our ardour to begin the fray, Bear the best feelings of the soul away. Our nation's fame commands me not to fire, Hence, bid the crew to quench this false desire: They this neutrality must first debase, But we our country never will disgrace. âIn honour'd warfare, let us die or live, Then, future glory will our names receive; But darkness gives that character a stain, Who fights his foe, distress'd upon the main.â What time this converse Downes and Porter held, Hillyar thought nothing, but his ship to yield; His crew stood shuddering with expectance dire, That from the Essex havock would expire; Th' ungenerous Briton, speechless with surprise, Could not give credence to what pass'd his eyes, Why that his enemy forebore the strife, To strike his vessel through her ribs of life. So once a traveller, in a weary mood, Call'd at an inn for rest and generous foodâ A felon soft pursu'd him to his hold, To spill his blood, and rob him of his gold. The murderer, arch, assum'd a smiling leer, To blind his purpose from the eye of fearâ But in the hellish act to lift his knife To reach the centre of the traveller's life, The hand of justice fasten'd him in chains, For former crimes, committed on the plains! His crimson guilt half took away his breathâ He pal'd, he trembled at the thoughts of death: Thus Hillyar stood, expecting to expire Beneath the exploding of the Essex' fire: There nothing being in his mind but blood, He thought the same of others on the flood. At length, the tumult settling to a pause, It struck his thought, 'twas neutralizing lawsâ And, like a hypocrite, with dastard mind, Artful conceal'd the purpose he'd design'd. Porter, saluting with a flexile knee, He thus made smooth his hidden treachery: âIt seems the warring elements would feign Compel us here this sanctity to stain; The nations' law gives reverence to this fort, Where, social, we like brothers can consort. Pleasing it isârefreshing to my mind, You this regard, an honour to mankind; I enter'd with design to seek suppliesâ The tropick fruits and other rarities. âThough that I've plough'd vast circles of the sea, By order of my king in search of thee, Yet by the honour of the British name, That never yet was tarnish'd of its fame, I pledge my faith and write the same with blood, And call to test it an oath-sealing Godâ That I, this fair neutrality will keep, Nor offer battle, till on ocean's deep.â He ended with the oath. Porter rejoin'd, A flame of honour burning in his mind: âFor righteous Liberty whose flag is mine, I'd not be guilty of a base design. 'Tis for the hallow'd cause of neutral rights, And Independence, that Columbia fights; Hence, I your views reciprocate in full; None can presume your promise you'll annul. âNow when that you your vessel shall repair, Then, off the harbour, will I meet you there; There, we can battle in the light of fame, I, for Columbia, you, for Albion's name. âForty and six, the Essex bears of brass, With five times fifty,âhearts magnanimous. The PhÅbe far outmeasures her in power; Our guns outnumbering, thirteen two and four. Though thus unequal, never I'll refuse To meet you, single, at what time you choose. Hence, ere we mingle in the fight, you'll please Command your consort distant o'er the seas.â Hillyar rejoins: âMy joy is with the brave, Hence, ship to ship we'll meet upon the wave. Tucker, of Cherub, with the wind shall fly; My word is pledg'd, and on that pledge rely. âSee, she approaches with a press of sail; But, when refitted, she shall take the gale. And when departed on the ocean's swell, A gun from me the circumstance will tell, Then, I prepar'd shall be, to meet you there, And prove the virtue of the flags we bear.â The Briton spoke like honour. Porter last, While still the PhÅbe to the shrouds was fast: âI strict shall mark the signal of attack; Now spread your square-sails,âtake the wind aback, While from our cordage, we your vessel clear, That you may anchor in the channel near. âAnd while in port, we'll friendly acts display; With Tucker, come and visit us to day. We've all the varities in season now, Such as within the southern tropicks grow. And wine of mellow age, our hearts to cheerâ At sea proud enemiesâbut friendship here.â Hillyar turn'd pale, then redden'd,âpale, to find Such worth and boldness in his foe combin'd; For though devoid of virtue was his soul, He felt its power to bend him to control. He stammer'd to replyâbut all in vainâ His failing tongue seem'd fasten'd with a chain. A miser thus hard bolts his iron door, Against a pressing strangerâraiment poor, Lest he by chance, his homely fare should give, Nor for the same, equivalent receive; By long entreatance and the pelting storm, At length he deigns to suffer him to warm; But pines in moodish silence at his stay, Fearing he'd nothing for the night repay. But when at dawn, the stranger quits his shed, He more than satisfies for board and bed; The miser stands abash'd to mark the ore, And chokes, and stammers at the creaking door. Thus Hillyar stood and stammer'd to reply, His features mark'd with idiot vacancy. Meantime the mariners, on shrouds and mast, Loosen the PhÅbe, to the Essex fast. Some cords they sever, others they belay; Freed, she winds off and anchors in the bay. The Cherub moors upon her larboard side, Her flag reflected in the rippling tide. Tucker, impatient to the PhÅbe goes To learn the cause, why neither came to blows: âI watch'd your movements with an anxious eye, Till I beheld you with the enemy; And then I judg'd, as no deep engine roar'd, You'd chang'd your plan and laid the ship on board, Hence, wore I down, had you my strength requir'd, To give you succour, as you late desir'd; But think what wonder in my bosom rose, To see you friends, where I expected foes.â While Tucker put the question, Hillyar stood, As though the life were taken from his blood. Defeated pride o'erwhelm'd him in his shame, And caus'd a sweat to settle on his frame. âJust in the act to touch the fireâa gale Rush'd down the mountains, quartering on the sail, And drove us on the foe! who, at a blast, Might ship and crew beneath the waters cast; But, by disguising what was my design, The ship I rescu'd from the strangling brine. âWe'll put away the themeâdescend below, And moist the blood and give it natural flow, For now, I'm exorcis'd with fever-dry; These southern suns make English fibres fry.â Three days refitting, they in harbour ride, But on the fourth, their vessels trimm'd, supplied, The grappling anchors from their beds they weigh, Just as the orient purples with the day. When Porter heard the token, he express'd The glowing thoughts that harbour'd in his breast: âHarkâhear the whistle to the Albion crew, To spread their sheets, and bid to peace adieu! Soon will our ears receive the signal gun; And see the red flash o'er the waters run. âNow, now, my heroes, let no dampness chill The heart's warm beating to subdue the will. We'll prove superior, though our means are small, And wrap their bodies in a bleeding pall. This is the hour to waken into flame Your bosoms, to ascend the steep of fame; Yes, I behold a spirit in your eye To strike yon Cross, or find eternity!â His voice inspir'd the mariners with life, To hear the signal to begin the strife. As when in theatre a numerous crowd, Collected to behold some action proud; A Warwick towering with a Shakspeare's soul, Bending the will of monarchs to control; Or great Gustavus, character'd by Brook, Loosing his people from a tyrant's yoke, Set in impatience to observe the scene Rise and unfold the mightiest deeds of men; As limping Time approaches to the hour, Attention stronger fastens every power. At length, the musick, with prelusive strain, Causes a thrill to dart through every vein; By the sweet notice of the varying tune, That the green canvass would be lifted soon. So like the musick was the hero's tongue, The crew impatient, felt their nerves new strung. Now while the PhÅbe and the Cherub sail'd, With boist'rous lungs, thus Hillyar, Tucker hail'd: âBe true to what I've said. Bear from the strandâ But mark you well, my signals of command. Should I by token, ask for your return, You'll place the Cherub opposite her stern.â Tucker brief answer'd: âWhen your signals fly, With prompt obedience will my ship comply.â This said, he rounds the helm and shifts the sail, And beats the ocean with a sidling gale; Like some huge whale, he foams along the deep, Bending his eye upon the challeng'd ship. What time the Cherub parts the curling seas, Hillyar, this motto boastingly displays: God and our CountryâTraitors, both offendâ For Rights of royal Britons, we contend! âInstant the signal, let the gun declare! And let the Essex meet us if she dare! Now be ye ready with a tide of blood, Should she approach, to gulf her in the flood.â The moment Hillyar the commandment spoke, The cannon pour'd its voice in cloud of smoke! As when a traveller, wilder'd in defiles, Where no delighting form of human smiles, Through mazy windings, labours hard his way, O'er fens, o'er bogs, where poisonous serpents lay, Dejected, heart-sickâOft he stops to hear Some welcome echo, to his bosom dear. The frog's hoarse croaking, and the adder's hiss, Congeal his bloodâhis heart stands motionless. While thus despairing, lo! a well-known voice Breaks on his ear and bids his soul rejoice. With throbs of ecstacy his bosom starts, While from his eye, an holy rapture darts: Such joy was Porter's when the cannon told The promis'd time, his valour to unfold: âHearken! what musick?âBrief the anchor weigh! Behold the signal blazing on the sea! The sound is musick from the heavenly poleâ The quickening flash is glory to the soul! Beyond this grovelling earth, my mind takes wing; A strange sensation touches every string! See, on the breath of heaven your Rights unfurl'd! Fame catch your deeds and wing them round the world!â His words were sparkles of electrick fire, Which flam'd their thoughts beyond this earth's desire. A tear of transport floated in their eye, Whilst, God and Liberty! they shouted high. Slow moves the Essex, veil'd in solemn awe, Gloomy as night to hurl the bolts of war. Her look strikes terrour through the Briton's soul; Hillyar can scarce his tottering joints control. His cheek turns pale, though clasping death's cold urn; He sets a flag, the Cherub to return. Lo, as her brass, the Essex bears aside, He slips his anchorâbounds along the tide. Porter crowds sail, the chase to overtake; Full brief the Essex foams upon her wake; Her levell'd engines bellow from her prow, And, at the enemy, the chain balls throw. At each explosion, sail and cordage part; And oft they search the centre of her heart. At length, the Cherub to her aid returns, And each, whole broadsides at the Essex burns! As when the sun rejoicing in his height, Sprinkles creation with empyreal light; With living brilliance burnishes the whole To nature's round, the essence and the soul; A treacherous cloud comes sweeping o'er the ball, And shrouds his radiance in death's smothering pall; But soon, he musters to a point his rays, And breaks its darkness with effulgent blaze: So Porter's, kindling, every bosom fir'dâ For lo, above the earth his mind aspir'd; But when the treachery of the foe was seen, A cloud of darkness deepen'd on his mien; But rising soon, he swept the cloud awayâ His features brighten'd like the god of day! âAvast the ship! A tier of engines roar! A treacherous, dastard foe! The strife give o'er. Back to the neutral anchor-ground return, And, as we sail, cast thunder from the stern. What coward infamy! Noânever more, I'll trust a Briton should his heart drop gore.â Slow wears the Essex at the order round, While thrice the cannon with dire peal rebound. Her snowy canvass flickers in the wind; Rustling it fills. She leaves her foes behind. And now in harbour once again she rides, Whilst every tongue the British faith derides. Porter commands: âCharge, charge the engines deep, And firm for action, each defender keep; The dastard Hillyar, having stain'd his soul, Not him, will oaths or neutral waves control. When man is once to cowardice inclin'd, He holds no virtue in his grovelling mind. When eagle honour quits her empire here, The soul runs wasteâa barren desert drear. âThough that his oath in solemn pledge have I, That he'd regard this fair neutrality; But what can promises or oaths effect, When meanness 'habits in the intellect? âBut look! they cast their anchors off the strait! It seems they purpose for the time to wait. âNow their design, I apprehend to be, Is to imprison, bar us from the sea; If their intention this,âthen our design Will be to pass, and gain the ocean's brine. With ease we'll fly them when the offer's given, By breezes springing from the gate of heaven.â While Porter jealous of his enemies, Tucker, (his vessel moor'd,) to Hillyar hies, To learn the motive why his vessel run: âScarce you with fire, gave motion to a gun; Why from the Essexââ âEssex! what of her? Are you empower'd to act as arbiter? Full well I comprehend my sovereign's will, And shall perform itâevery part fulfil. Hence, to your vessel and my signs attend, For I shall nothing of my plans rescind. âBut stayâI purpose to confine him here; Never again he swims the ocean clear. Close we'll imprisonâbind him to the shore, Till he submiss the royal flag adore.â Tucker in friendship readily rejoins: âThis mode of warfare answers my designs. But heard you not the monarch's last remark, That we should strict observe them in the dark, Or they might shun us by their gifted sight To wind their way, when heaven is spread with night: This naught avails himâshould by day he dare, Soon would he find his vessel in the air. âAs we in number twice exceed his force, For us, how easy to obstruct his course; But as, divided, we command this power, 'Tis equal triple, if not one to four.â Thus Tucker. Hillyar thus: âI grant with you, Our obvious strength is triple to the foe; But well I mark'd the Essex in her ire, To once of ours, exploded thrice her fire; Hence, when that we our real strength compare, Not so unequal our divisions are, Therefore shall I all methods exercise, Through least of danger to effect the prize. âTagus, Plantagenet, Carnation,âthese, I apprehend are in the neighbouring seas; When they arrive with all their armament, Without resistance, will her flag be rent.â Thus they on board the Hillyar-ship converse, And plans of conquest with themselves rehearse. Now night succeeds to day, and day to night, While the fam'd Essex, by superior might, Is barr'd in close imprisonment to port, Without a gale to make the bold effort To pass the enemy. But Porter, true, Keeps brac'd in heart the valour of his crew; Though thus to be confin'd upon the flood, Would bring a dampness on the best of blood, But yet the mariner with cheerful air, Breaks short the leaden sceptre of despair. At length, the forty-second dawn appears With winds tempestuous, from the southern spheres; Fierce from the Cape, where infant storms abide, And issue forth to chafe the western tide. Porter with gladness congregates his crew, While the winds rushing to the ocean blew. The quickening impulse to the seamen given, Was like a visit from the sons of heaven: âProud swell the heart! Our fame is not yet done! Mark, mark the chafing billows how they run! Hssteâheave the biting anchors from the clay! Mates! spring aloftâthe ready sheets display! Hearken!âthe starboard cable is in twain! The vessel drags the larboard to the main! Popitious omen!âtouching to the soul! The sheets give to the wind!âlet every heart be whole!â Th' impatient seaboys take the word like fire; Quick catching at the rattlings they aspire; Loosen the sails and spread them to the breeze, To drive the vessel darting through the seas: The main-sails first, with hollow sound unfold, And then, the angling jibs, the fierce winds hold; The top-sailsâthen, top-gallant-sails appear, Like silver clouds unfolding in the sphere. The ship like lightning through the water flies: âTake in the gallant-top-sails!â Porter cries, âReef, reef the jib-sheets. To the windward steer, Double the point, and gain the ocean clear!â His brief instructions rapidly were done, While foaming high the bounding vessel run. She seems a cloud dark-flying on a storm, While lightning fires augment its awful form. Like this, the Essex through the mad wave flies, To gain the sea beyond her enemies. The Britons gazeâand shrink before their fears; They ply their anchors, as the ship appears; She looks a whale of ocean in her path, Tossing the billows to the clouds in wrath. While thus terrifick round the point she flew, A mad tornado from the mountains blew; A monster howling in its fury driven, With all the strength collected under heavenâ Loud rushing, roaring, thundering, drove the blastâ Down crackling, crashing, fell her shiver'd mast! As when that Fancy, in a midnight dream, Translates the soul and opens it, a gleam Of blissful Paradiseâwhich wraps its gaze, Delighted in a trance of ecstacies; Lo, as she Fancy. bears it to the gate of heaven, About to open an admittance given, She plunges down to hell and brings from thence, A form to drive the vision'd glory hence, Grim as a goblin, by the moon half seen, Setting on graves, where murderers had been! Which seizing at the soul with sunken eye, Transforms its raptures into agony: Such feelings thrill'd the veins of Porter brave, As proud his vessel bounded on the wave; Such, and so sudden was his joy subdu'd, When down the sky-mast thunder'd in the flood. At length his voice was heard: âRuin'dâundone! The helm's alee!âback to the harbour run! From ruins free the ship! Let none despair! Luff, luff to wind, nor let the vessel wear! Away, lads! bear awayâvast! rightâshe's right! Flame the guns aft and give her running fight!â Fleet as sounds travel through the hollow air, The ship was trimm'dâher stern guns lumber'd war. And while they cast their bolts along the main, The crippled Essex sought the port again. The crew, in three ships' distance from the shore, In neutral anchorage their vessel moor, And fall to labour, like excited fire, To cause another mast to heaven aspire. Now when the Albion saw the ruin fall, Cautious they wore, and drove a distant ball. Hillyar commands: âDown on the vessel bear, And show what we in naval action are! Let each be ready at the signal call, At far-off distance to elance the ball. Though that the ship is crippled of a mast, Yet may her guns be terrible in blast. âI not these neutral waters will regard; But seize the happy moment of reward; Yes; power gives rightâthis truth our sovereign knows, And justifies all methods with his foes. âWhat though my oath I counterfeit did pledge, That not in harbour I'd the battle wage; And what are oaths? as gossamer, or down, When great advantage on our side is known, And know ye not, 'tis sanctified by laws, That oaths bind not from terrifying cause; Hence, I'm enfranchis'd from that pledge of late, For then, a hair but held us from our fate. Our ship was like an infant in their power; The oath preserv'd us in that desperate hour. âNo more. The sheets take in. With caution turn, And at fair distance settle on her stern; Level the balls to strike her life-ribs through, And let her sides be crimson'd with her crew.â He gave his thoughts. His mariners rejoice To find a distant action was his choice, For though unmasted by the whirlwind dire, Inward they dread the waking of her ire. The trumpet Hillyar plies with swelling cheeks, And thus to Tucker of the Cherub speaks: âCherub! attend! see every part be clear! Prepare for battle with your strength severe! Charge deep and prime your cannon for the blow; Cast your spring anchors opposite her bow; Kindle your matches, let them smouldering burn; I at fair distance blaze upon her stern.â Tucker replied: âTo me your word is law; My every brass is ready for the war.â The shores around and neighbouring heights are seen, And house-tops, balconies, with crowds of men, In breathless silence, gazing on the stream, To mark the lightnings of the conflict gleam. Their souls, their hearts, their every fibre feel A cold ice terror for the Essex weal; The slightest motion of the vessel proves A mark'd attention; if a haulyard moves, Or a sail flutters, every bended eye, With prying look, enquires the reason why. Porter, at once, their dastard purpose scann'd, And thus a moment he address'd his band: âBehold the foe comes bearing for the storm! Now prove what hearts of valour can perform! Though they our ship outmeasure, three to one, We'll draw their blood before the fight is done. Behold what thousands crowd the summits high! Now show the manner that the brave can die!â As brief he clos'd, the ships began to burn; One on the bow,âthe other on the stern. CANTO XII. PORTER'S DEFENCE OF THE ESSEX. ARGUMENT. Transactions of the Infernal powers .... The Defence of the Essex. The scene is laid on the White Mountains and at Valparaiso .... The book commences at midnight preceding the attack, and closes with the action, which continues two hours and twenty-six minutes. The Muse must leave the battle in its flame To show the movements of th' infernal name; For they, unceasing, exercis'd their art To break the chain of Unity apart; A chain, when sundered, nothing can unite, The Star of Freedom will be quench'd in night. Now, in night-season, previous to the day That Porter strove to gain the open sea, The Fiend, involv'd in double darkness deep, Convok'd his agents on the rude cliffs' steep. They rose, like clouds of smoke at signal given; A flash of hell from either eye-ball driven. At times, the Fiend betray'd an outward air, Which show'd a bosom canker'd with its care: Since Freedom's Goddess on the ocean came, His heart had felt a secret smouldering flame, Yet with deep art, he kept the pain conceal'd, Lest it should bend the sceptre which he held: Not otherwise the monarchs of the earth, To keep obscur'd the weakness of their birth, Assume a robe of artificial guise, As though their race descended from the skies; But Wisdom comes,âstrips off their spider-dress, And brings to view their native nakedness. So the Infernal, with a proud effort, Kept his mind fix'd upon a regal port; But oft unguarded, would he raise his eye, As though he fear'd some terror from the sky. His heart misgiving, told him to repair Beneath the mountain,âfrom the upper air. Thus a deserter from the ranks of fame, Enroll'd with Albion his detested name; From Queenstown battlements, he marks sublime The Freedom Star, that gilds his native clime. The sight in secret preys upon his heart, His eye depress'd, reveals the inward smart; He pines with fever to be led afar, Beyond the radiance of th' upbraiding Star. So the Deserter from the ranks of heaven, The time Fredonia to his sight was given, Perceiv'd a gnawing at his heart severe, As though transfix'd with her celestial spear. Yet, he began with consequential pride To bolster up the royals by his side: âProud agency of hell! great was the art, That Lawrence bow'd to deathâhis vessel wreck'd. Beside this naval conquest on the flood, Other achievements animate Our blood: Undying honours crown Our royal son, Proctor the great! who, when his race is run On this terrene, in hell shall overseer The damn'd of the infernal hemisphere; But We design to practise him on earth A time some longer, ere We call him forth. â'Twas known in hell, full thirty years or more, That Cruelty, who lash'd with scorpions sore The souls confin'd in chains, was sent a spy To scourge Columbia, till her name should die. âSoon We perceiv'd that those of Albion blood Excell'd his art to torture on the flood; Hence, as that hell was empty of the place, Sudden he thought to mingle with the race, That one might be created to supply The station, occupied by Cruelty. âWith this intent from hell's wide gate We flew, Keeping the coast of Labrador in view. Like flame, up-leaping, soon We reach'd the cape; There took We lineaments of human shape. We wander'd south along a broken waste, To find an object suited to Our taste. Not small the numbers hearken'd to Our love, For where is woman, but soft note will move? âAt length We found her in a narrow dell, Though not in beauty did her form excel; Searching she was the favourite of the flock, Which far had wander'd from the sheltering rock. She look'd, in waning eye, beyond her years; A bloody ichor floated down for tears; Her forehead swell'd in ridges like the sea; Her nose a promontory, form'd a bay, In which her red eyes swam. On either side, Her cheeks shrunk back and left her mouth full wide Invading on her ears. Her mouldering teeth Were half consum'd, by reason of her breath; Which to the smell a stronger poison gave, Than the green nostril of the rotten grave. âSoft We approach'd, and call'd her wond'rous fair; At which she smil'dâpast hell her hideous air! Our aid the lamb We proffer'd her to find, Which she accepted with a willing mind. With oily periods and light amorous play, We loiter'd careless o'er the woody way; We sigh'd, then whisper'd, then impress'd her hand, Which seem'd in fever, like a hell-lit brand. âAt length, We happen'd at a cedar grove; And Proctor prov'd the subject of Our love. âIn the brief compass of nine moons and one, Our promis'd offspring gaz'd upon the sun; His mother nurs'd him for as many more, From breasts distilling milk combin'd with gore. And then she fed him on the things of earth, Abhorr'd by all, save those half hell at birth. âHe grew apaceâand while but yet a youth, Ways he contriv'd to torture life, uncouth. 'Twould pierce a fury's callous heart with pain, Should We his moods of cruelty explain. âBut where of late he testified his blood, Was at the Massacre at Raisin's flood; This reckless slaughter will exalt his name To royal honours in the world of flame. âNow when his murder in this war is done, We shall in hell demand Our favourite son. Each day, he grows more pleasing in Our eye; Worthy his sire, and mother Infamy. âThese proud events Our feelings render glad, But she, that circles heaven, affects Us sad. Lawrence she met with rainbow cloud, and bore His soul enfranchis'd to th' empyreal shore. Curse on her form! she may in lightning come With power divine, and all Our hopes deplume. âBut why these doubts? why shrink?âSingle, not We Would shrink to meet in arms her enmity. From this, Our hand, a bolt of thunder hurl'd, Would shrive her spear and drive her from the world. âDoes not New-Albion aid Us in the work? And soon with gold will We dissever York. These States at Hartford, in Convention still, Will meetâthe Union secretly to kill; And Maryland appears a wavering tide, Doubting, to learn what manner to decide. When vacillating thus a People stand, Th' event is sureâthey do as We command. Our labours thicken fast. The State of Maine Must be divided from the Union chain; She stands aloneâOur friends on every side To hem her in, her strength to subdivide. âBut future, by some casualty unknown, Should We, of States be rifled, now Our own; Those, that renounce their Freedom for a Throne,â For not the powers of earth, or air, or sea, Can tell the chance of war's uncertainty,â Hence, to be furnish'd, ready for defeat, We'll forth provide a cavern to retreat. And should the powers of heaven prevail with art, (The thought of which is distant from Our heart) We'll plan an earthquake, ruinous to raise, To whelm the States and snatch them from the skies. âWe purpose now to journey round the earth, To mark through all its realms what passes forth. Rise, harness for the labourâdrive the work; At change of moon, I shall return by York.â Stately he rose, when he the order spoke; The mountain felt it, and with terror shook. His form assum'd the lightness of a cloud, Which wrapp'd the gloomy heights in grave-cloth shroud; His arm was like a pillar on the sea, Form'd by the gathering of humidity; His hand was like th' appearance of a ghost, That haunts the ruins of a ship-wreck coast. His eyes were two mock moons, broad, sickly, dim, When deep through murky clouds, they wandering swim. The monarch having pass'd,âthe Stygian bands Commenc'd the cavern with their giant hands; Earth groan'd with dying pangs;âso vast their toil, It made the fluid of their hearts to boil. So when the Fulton is intent to keep, 'Gainst wind and tide, her course upon the deep, She feeds her furnace to a glassy heat, Causing her boilers in their rage to beat; To rush her engine with increase of power, And bear her forth against the ocean's roar. Soon the pent waters feel th' augmented fire, And with a madded violence aspire, Threatening to break their prison with a burst, And hurl the stately vessel into dust. Thus, by their toil, th' infernal bosoms chafe With such commotion, as not life is safe Within the compass of their breath to stay, For fear the boilers in their breasts give way. But Idleness, despisable in hell, Lingers behind, and strives their heat to quell, Contriving different means the toil to shun, For whom 'tis grief to move a pebble stone: While each hard sweats with labour at a strain, He quits his holdâexcuse, his breath to gain. The half-pois'd rock descends with crashing soundâ Full many a fiend disjointing in the ground. But lo, they quicken from the pressing death, And rise from out the prisoning rock beneath; Such the mysterious habit of their frame, They wake to life, like PhÅnix from the flame. Still, by excuses, he avoids the toil, Yet oft he puts the others in a broil. At length, they sought a momentary rest; He seiz'd the time, and thus his thoughts express'd: âSweet friends! your benefit, and not my own, Has often made me suffer from the Throne; But yet, most fervent in my breast I feel, Base it would be to fly the publick weal. âWith this desire I nothing can conceive, Why, for convenience, we should not relieve Our wearied natures? Why, with toil thus burn? Not till the moon the monarch will return. Alternate spies can watch his coming forth; A thousand cubits have we dug in earth, Hence we, secure, our efforts can delay, Till the last glimmer of th' appointed day; Then, ere his Majesty in wrath shall come, We, in full strength, our slavery can resume.â At first they doubtedâdreading to comply; But soon they rid them of timidity: A part retire and stretch them at their ease; Others, avidious, the occasion seize To join in tournamentâto wrestle, danceâ Or with a shield to exercise the lance. Ere the return of day's bright harbinger, The Fiend came sweeping, exercis'd with care! The earth was shaken in his passing forth, As though the storms were loosen'd from the north. Anxious at heart to make the labour burn, Was the main reason of his swift return; Trusting to Proctor to conduct the strife, Whose only joy was in the wreck of life. He finds his subjects,âpart upon the ground, Lost in their sleepâa part, with cedar crown'd, Dancing to musick, form'd by shaking bonesâ White human skulls,âin which were pebble stones! As when the lake of the infernal world Is by the tempest-cloud tumultuous hurl'd, Billows on billows toss'd with surging fire, The damn'd in pain, endeavouring to expire: So like the billows of the lake, the crew Rose in their terror at the interview; Wedg'd in confusion, toss'd from side to side, Their every eyeball stretch'd convulsive wide; As when a maniack in his fit finds death, Such was their look!âforgetting they had breath. The monarch seiz'd upon a scourge of wire, Such as had made our mariners expire, Whilst corded, cruel, to the Albion mast, Pleading their Freedom, till they groan'd their last: Such a damn'd whip the madded Tyrant fell, With grin severe, applied upon their hell. At every stroke gush'd forth a tide of gore, Burning and black, while stood on every pore A drop of blood, excited by the pain, Which kept their eyeballs bursting on a strain. âWhat means this breaking of commands?â He spoke, Distant it seem'd his tongue had thunder broke! His subjects shrunk in terror from his sight; His very breath turn'd horrible the night. âIf from Our mandate ever that ye dare, By pillars, propping of deep hell, we swear, From this shall each without a wing be hurl'd To check his falling to the nether world! Or in the surging lake unceasing burn; Or chain'd in ice, thence never to return!â He ended frowning. To their giant size, From whence they'd shrunk, like dash'd-up flames, they rise, And to the sinking of the cavern hie, Jarring the mountain like an earthquake nigh. In solid mass they loose the earth's deep base, As though its whole foundations they'd displace; They break it into parts and hurl it high, The wonders past of ages to outvie. As when Archemides of Syracuse Engines invented for his country's use, Which drove unwieldy rocks upon the foe, And crowded vessels shiver'd at a blow;â Or by the lever, or the winding screw, Seiz'd from the deep a fighting ship and crew, Whirling it round, a spinning-top in air, The dizzy seamen fainting in despair. With the same ease, th' infernal agents throw The mountain-rocks from out the pit below. One breaks the massâanother, on the wing, Grasps, and, at straining with a desperate fling, Hurls it aloftâanother, plac'd on high, Keeps it in motion with rapidity; Another, ready with his strength immense, Drives it beyond with burning violence. Lo, by this art, so rapid they aspire, They heat, and smoke, and kindle into fire; So thick are they, as in a whirlwind sent, It seems like Ãtna in the firmament. At length the fiends produce unusual sound, As with their sledges on the rocks they pound; They hearâand stop their labour with surprise, To learn the cause from whence the echoes rise. âAnd what,â (the monarch thus) âwhat damps your brow? Dastards! give backward!âEarthquakes are below.â This said. He seiz'd upon a sledge of weightâ Poiz'd it on high with horrid joy elate, And round and round, he swung it with a whir, Huge as the summit of a mountain spur. Its helve was fashion'd of the stoutest oak, That ever fell beneath the woodman's stroke. With straining backward,âresting on his right, His left toe touching on the surface light, The heel bent outward from his body, round He struck!âthe rocks crack'd crashing with a thunder sound. Earth, reeling, groan'd through all her caves beneath, Sweating cold dampnessâcold as ooze of death! Down horrid sunk the Fiend! down, down, deep down, From day's first beam, till high on heaven's arch'd crown The gold sun stood! two thousand leagues or more; His iron skull a rock in fragments tore! Like Pilot's Tower, Mountain in North-Carolina. o'erthrown by earthquake storm, His whole vast length lies stretch'd out huge in form. His eyes swim glaring in a vacant gaze; His mind is lost in labyrinthian maze. At length, recovering as from broken sleep, His voice resounded through the hollow deep: âGive way to swing the sledge! What damps your brow? Retire! behold an earthquake is below! We'll break its hollow sides!âWhat, do you feign, As though your ears so delicate, felt pain To hear the earth groan out? 'Tis musick rare, If We its note to uproar'd hell compare. Standâhear it!âit explodes!â âWhat! sunk to hell! When left the earth? It seems a wizard spell! Which wayâfrom whence? Why whirls this darkness round? Can this be other than deep hell profound? Our nostrils, sure, familiar brimstone smellâ Black as Death's chamber! 'tisâit must be hell! But where, and when did We?âOur head whirls o'er; Mysterious maze! beyond my reasoning power. And what's that light, which glimmers from the north? The light of hell from southern zone breaks forth! Attended ever with a deafening sound, But still as Death's vault is this deep profound. A labyrinth!âWe know not what to thinkâ Our mind is like a chain with broken link. âThe last that We remember was the rock, Which, when it broke, gave earth a reeling shock. And was it then that We from thence was hurl'd, By wrath of heaven, to this infernal world? âWe'll pause to gain Our mind, which seems to stray, The more We reason, from the truth away. âNot otherwise indeed! We broke the shell, And through the centre of the earth We fell! âSublime disclosure!âhow my thoughts elate! Here We, as though in hell, can smile at fate, Remote from heaven and heaven's unwelcome light, Which by its blaze gives anguish to the sight. âWe'll search this dungeon never known beforeâ Hark! whence proceeds this far-off lumbering roar?â His pinions open'd with a heavy swell, (Which time allow'd not, when through earth he fell); Onward he travers'd with dilated eye Wide as the circle in a midnight sky, When in eclipse the moon half veils her form, By which the mariner forebodes a storm. He meets a vacuum, and with fluttering falls, And, lizard-like, with effort hard he crawls. While thus he grovell'd onâhalf day,âhalf night, A distant something riveted his sight: And now it stopp'd, and now again it mov'd, Which action vital in the substance prov'd. Cautious, he gain'd upon the object slow, That more distinct its lineaments might show. Soft in concealment he approach'd it nigh, Then sudden rose in wild deformity! So sulphur'd nitre slumbers in the dark, Till sharp it feels the animating spark, When lo, it quickens with combustion dire, Flashing to view the horrible of fire: Thus rose the Fiend!âThe stranger caught his eye, And stood, a time unable to reply. âGod of this darkness! thou my life but save, And I will kneel and be to thee a slave! âI made inquiry at the north for thee, To be directed to thy Royalty, To kiss thy handâthy Majesty adore, And crave of thee, these regions to explore; But thou wert absent. Now, alas, I find, My life is forfeit by impatient mind! Accept of me, a slave! Years five and ten I've wander'd here remote from heaven and men. Perhaps, this calculation may be large, For when a train of miseries surcharge The human breast, a moment is a dayâ A year seems bordering to the earth's decay. My compass travers'd not, and hence, I've wound, Lost in a wilderness of error round, My life sustaining on the nascent forms, Of creeping thingsâthe rudiments of worms. âOnce in a cavern I beheld a light, Which seem'd to lead me from this world of night; I enter'd through a fissure in the rock; But O, what language can describe the shock! It prov'd a charnel-house, where death was seen In every stage, from infants up to men! Their pallid robes were scarcely moulder'd yet; Yea, some retain'd the drops of dying sweat! Horrid, they star'd me with an open lid, By which I knew 'twas Egypt's pyramid, Whose deep foundations on earth's shell were laid, To which I'd distant in my wanderings stray'd. The light produc'd was from the millions dead, Shining with death-fire on their nitrous bed. âO'erwhelm'd with horror at the dire abode, I felt as live things creeping through my blood, Despairing ever to behold again The smile of beauty, or the face of men. âI thus was roaming in my sickening round, When from the south I heard this unknown sound, Loosening the hanging rocks. I stopp'd amaz'd, When lo, thy Majesty before me rais'd!â Thus he. To whom the Fiend: âWe thought it thou, With mischief work, who caus'd the lumbering now. âBut who inform'd thee of Our empty sphere? Say, what enticement brought thy coming here? And is it not enough for thee to dwell Fronting the sun on earth's external shell, That thou must come a traitor to Our realm? Proclaim thy purposes, or death shall whelm Thy feebleness in dust! What, could not We Here reign secure from man's avidity? It seems, if it were possible to trace The path of hell, he'd search the dreadful place. And should I e'er behold its Magistrate, I'd give him caution, that he bar his gate, Or discontented man might inroads make, And from his hand his rightful sceptre take. âBut say, what mammon you expected here, Or what inducement brought you to Our sphere?â âSimple my answer: Science is my nameâ By searching, lo, I found, and spoke the same,â The earth's concavity. The serpent tongue Of scoffing ignorance with hissing rung. Yet still I gloried, though the spurn of all; And even Freedom hiss'd me from her hall. But not by scoffs, was I to be dismay'd, Till I in person, had the truth survey'd. Vain were their efforts to unman my soul; I pass'd the ice and enter'd at the pole. My course was guided by the martin's flight, When north she flew to spend her wintry night. You know my hist'ry since. I'll now describe, What secret motive acted as a bribe. âGreat I desir'd with Newton to be nam'd; Beyond the character of Franklin, fam'd; I thought to notice how the springs were form'd, And, through the poles, how earth was inward worm'd. Pure veins of virgin silver,âmines of gold, I doubted not, delighted to behold; Pearls, gems and petrefactions, diamonds bright, I apprehended would enchant my sight; And all the treasures in the deep sea hurl'd, My mind conceiv'd had found this darksome world; For, by the test of geometrick line, I learnt the greatest depths of ocean's brine; Hence my philosophy had plac'd them here, Dropp'd through the centre of earth's concave sphere. âThese were my views thy regions to explore, And not for mammon or his mines of ore, Hence, O my life in mercy deign to save, And I will kneel and be thy menial slave!â âWe keep no slaves!â The Fiend with frown rejoins, âSlaves groan above, but not in Our confines. Though man enjoys the influence of heaven, No greater monster to the world is given, Since he, of all created by a God, Stands mark'd with hell in slaving of his blood! âGo, measure back Our trace,â'twill lead thee north, And through the pole direct thee to the earth. Thou hast sufficient punishment endur'd, The madness of thy brain must now be cur'd. Go, and proclaim what wonders thou hast found, We thought it thee, who caus'd this jarring sound.â With feat of wings, false Science flew with haste; The backward progress of the Fiend he trac'd. Ere long he mark'd earth's window at the pole, Which shot new happiness along his soul; From thence to Greenland he pursu'd his way; A vessel there was ready for the sea: With swelling sails he made his native shore, And told of wonders never told before. Meanwhile hell's monarchy strode hurrying forth, To learn what cause convuls'd the central earth. At every step he reach'd eight furlongs o'er, In compass guided by th' unceasing roar, Which, as more near upon the south he drew, Loud and more loud its deep concussion grew. At length he paus'd upon a beetling height, Round which in vain the ocean spent its might; By earth's quick motion spinning round her pole, Causing the waves impetuous back to roll; He stood aghast at the tumultuous scene, A dark convulsion gathering on his mien. But soon he broke the spell: âWhat, pause with fear? We who can smooth through hell's mad ocean steer! What though these chafing billows foam around, We'll learn the cause from whence the thunders sound! Thunders which seem this sea to undulate; Why doubt we thus?âWe are impell'd by fate!â This said, his arms he fasten'd to his side; His feet together in a knot were tied; To earth he settled, as he chang'd his form, Like Norway monster, hatch'd midst ocean's storm. His length twelve furlongs, and his compass round Would thrice outmeasure, roll'd along the ground, The largest wheel, that wind or water power Ere drove to crush the golden wheat to flour. In this dread shape he edges to the height, Which overhung the ocean, flashing light; For by the dashing of the billows dire, The foaming surf shot particles of fire. Now on the hanging rocks in volumes round, He coils and coils to make the dreadful bound. His head slow rises from the centre full, With one eye glaring from his ridgy skull, Like the moon struggling in the earth's deep shade, As though Death's hand upon her cheek were laid: Like this, appears the terror of his eye, From the vast summit of the cliff on high. And now his head hangs dreadful o'er the steep, Measuring the distance to the surging deep. This done, the horrid shape with rapid whirl, Darts back his head within the serpent coil; At once quick-rising with impulsive bound, Making a groan surpassing thunder's sound, Leaps in the foam! Alarm'd the ocean roars, And flies with horror from the startling shores Beyond the compass of his utmost reach, Leaving the monster dry upon the beach! But hovering Fate, (invisible till now) Thus to the Oceanâlightnings round her brow! âAnd art thou ign'rant whom that thou hast fled? The king of hell, most terrible to dread! Ocean! return thy billows to the shore, And bear him forth to where these deafenings roar. Yea, should'st thou pause a moment to return, His fiery breath will cause thy waves to burn! Or change thy liquid kingdom into stone! A moment pausing and thy name is done!â The ocean heard her voice: And with a sound Like battling armies breaking the profound, Roll'd back his frighted billows to the shore, To swim the dÃ¦mon with their buoyant power. Instant the Fiend was balanc'd on the deep, He summ'd his strength its turbulence to sweep; So swift his length along the waves he throws, The waters for a time forget to close; A spacious vacuum in the ocean stands, Till Fate advancing, shuts it with her hands. Nearer the monster gains upon the sound; It seems that hell upon their anvils pound. A brighter green reflected through the sea, Inspires his hope of rising into day. Sudden, behold a water-spout in form, He lifts his head confounded in a storm Equal to hell, when forging of its fire, 'Neath which th' infernals for the time expire! He stands astonish'd with a dizzy eye; And back most gladly from the scene would flyâ But motive powers fail! At length the chain, Which cramp'd his heart, gave way, and he amain Receiv'd the giant vigour of his might, And his quick keenness of discerning sight, By which he scann'd the nature of the blast, A naval battle, roll'd in thunders vast! He yawn'd his mouth to gulp the Essex whole; At second thought, he thus express'd his soul: âJaws! be ye shut, and, Appetite, be still! Yon island in the bay thy maw shall fill. âAnd shall We now these royal ships befriend. That they more able may in fight contend? We'll never do itâno. The Essex there, Scarce on her foes a single brass can bear; With this advantage, if they not excel, They may be conquer'd, and be sunk to hell.â When to himself these sentiments were said, Beneath the troubled wave he dipp'd his head. What time these scenes transpir'd, the conflict blaz'd So vast, the monsters from their caverns rais'd To learn the cause, which burnt upon the flood, And made them tremble in their deep abode. They look'd, and fled affrighted from their death, Far in the depths immeasurable beneath. The brazen engines, with terrifick sound, Disturb'd the slumbers of the sleeping ground. The earth through all her entrails dire was shock'd, The neighbouring mountains with the deafening, rock'd. The fulminating peals, so vast the fray, Resembled thunders of the Judgment Day. So fierce the Essex' blaze, the Cherub now Not longer can endureâshe leaves the bow, Cautious she winds from whence the lightnings burn, And, with the PhÅbe, settles on her stern. Till this the springs upon the Essex stood, By which the heroes warp'd her on the flood, And dread explosions burst from either side, Pouring a flaming deluge o'er the tide; But now the chain balls of the enemy Asunder rend them, as they leap the sea; But Linscott, Barnewell, reckless of the blast, Soon make new cables to the anchors fast, Then round the sailors with the capstans play, To bring the vessel opposite the fray; But as they place the ready guns to bear, Again the hawsers separate in air! Barnewell again, and Linscott, forth renew The sever'd parts, supported by the crew. But as the gunners whirl the linstocks round, The match to brighten ere they touch to sound, Behold the springs are broken by the fight; Again the heroes, with a leaping light, The separations with swift hands belay, But soon the wild fire shatters them away! Like spiders' threads before the storm they part, While fierce the battle drives against her heart. Guns nine time ten impetuous ruins pour; Purpling her waist descends the trickling gore; The gazing shores, as they behold the fight, Wring their sad hands and sicken at the sight: So when the arm of tyrannizing power Brought to the scaffold the exalted More, He stood, unalter'd in his virtue great, And smil'd indignant at the stroke of fate. The gather'd multitude with wonder gaz'd To mark his soul above death's darkness rais'd: But when he bow'd to taste the bloody axe, Their passions soften'd down like melting wax; They pray'd, they groan'd, they wept, they tore their hair, And beat their bosoms bleeding with despair. In anguish thus the Chilian patriots stood To mark the Essex pour her martyr'd blood. As stands mount Ãtna roll'd in fire and smoke, So Porter stood, and, fill'd with valour, spoke: âNever, O never, let us dream despair, We yet three engines on the foe can bear; Through the stern port-lights heavy let them burst: A God of justice will support the just!â The sons of ocean heard;âand, with a bound, Applied the cannon in tremendous round; Like three hell-dragons madden'd into wrath, A host infernal smiting in their path, So imitated lightnings glanc'd their jaws, Which, for a time, gave triumph to the cause. The rising conflict terrible is driven, Like the last peals disturbing earth and heaven. The Albions, bleeding, shatter'd,âin dismay, Withdraw instinctive from the strife away! Lo, as they backward from the blood-work bore, The gazing multitudes the welkin tore,â Their shouts redoubling, thunder'd up the sky, Like rising whirlwinds, when the storms are nigh. Hillyar, with wringing of his hands, despair'dâ Fearful his eyes with open wildness star'd; His jaw-bones chatter'd in an aguish mood; Back from his features shrunk his freezing blood; Lo, by the strangling passion of dismay, His up-turn'd hair grew aged in a day! At length, his tongue was loosen'd from its chain, And thus to Tucker he reveal'd his pain, Their vessels board to board; âSpread sail and fly! Nothing can live that breathes mortality! See how the harness of the ships is cut! Behold the life-ribs broken by the shot! The balls have smote us wind and water lowâ Hark! how they rush!âWe've met with overthrow! Our vessels drink the sea! We drownâwe drownâ Goneâlost forever in the ocean down! Labour the suctions!âurgent, every hand; Let none distinction feel! We strand, we strand! Perhaps with effort we may yet survive, Till abler strength from Albion shall arrive. I'll fight no more, till Tagus foams along, And others aid us in the battle strong.â Thus he. But Tucker with excited pride Dissenting, thus right gallantly replied: âYou've pain'd my heart! By England's honour'd name, By the proud glory of our naval fame, Renounce, throw back, this purpose of disgrace, And prove the nobler daring of our race. As now have we the gloomy fight begun, What would our nation, should we dastard run? Yea, school-boy striplings would around us press, And wag their heads and scout our littleness. Hark! how the Chilians shout upon the shore! They now detest us;âshould we fight no more, They'll point the hissing finger of their scorn, And scoffing cry: âBehold the ocean-born!â âCast from your mind this womanish affair, And prove, but death our courage can impair. What though a portion of our strength is dead, Observe the foe! her waist with blood is red! âOn starboard quarter we'll the war renew, Where not a gun can reach to strike us through; There, we secure, upon her life can aim, And, void of danger, set her in a flame. Her cannonades will nothing her avail, While we, at distance, shall her life assail. âMost true, in many a battle have I been, Where ocean redden'd with the blood of menâ At Cape Trafalgar, and at Egypt's Nile, Where death did feast and on the banquet smile, But never such defence was ever known, As Porter and his mariners have shown; But if no cannon bear upon our life, We must become the victors in the strife.â While Tucker thus dissuaded to retire, Hillyar, with grapes distill'd, arous'd his fire: âThe every fibre of your heart is true; You've wak'd a spirit in my bosom new. Proof have you given, that English is your blood, A heart of oak to sink her in the flood. âDistant we'll cause her banner to submitâ Behold how swift our mariners refit! Replace the broken sparsâthe braces mendâ We creen her, lads!âwe creen her, beam an end! Moisten your courageâlet the goblets flow; We'll waste with fire, or strangle her below. âBut I'll not be a miser in my fame, Each shall have room to send aloft his name; Hence, for the present, I my place will yield, That, Bradburn, you the ship's command may wield; But I'll be with you, should the fight grow warm, And place my bosom opposite the storm.â With this excuse, he left th' impending scene To Bradburn's care, renown'd with valiant men. While each with each convers'd, the crews repair'd Their ships for action, by exertions hard. Beyond the striking distance of the brave, They drop their anchors in the neutral wave. Remote from danger, cowardly renew The dastard fight, striking the Essex through, While not a gun is possible to bear Against the foe, so angled from a square. Thus Putnam, chivalrous, in days of yore, Was bound a captive on the northern shore; Two hideous savages, with passions fell, Approach'd the hero, burning in their hell, And hurl'd their darts unerring through the air, But shunn'd his life,âthe compass of a hair; While piteous from his cheeks and arms and side, Gash'd with deep wounds, sad stream'd his crimson tide: Thus was the Essex by explosions rent, While bound, disaster'd, like imprisonment; So, like the savages, the Britons stood, And drew in gushing streams her best of blood. On every side, the prime of mortal clay Reel'd, gasp'd, and fell, and splash'd into the bay. Clouds ting'd with death around the vessel spread, And stifling seem'd to fold her with the dead. Yet Porter brightens as the darkness crowds, A light, reflecting on the coffin clouds; Pure like the splendour of a star at night, When others all are curtain'd from the sight By heavy-hanging clouds:âin flame he stands; O'er death he triumphs, and the brave commands: âImmortal deeds!âSunder the cable twain, And run upon the enemy amain. Neverânoânever shall the standard sinkâ Not while the mind has liberty to think!â The cable parted, as the word he gave; The vessel moves like madness on the wave; But, by the shifting of the wayward gales, To board, the hero in his purpose fails, Yet by superior knowledge of his art, He runs between and strikes them to their heart. So fierce, so terrible the Essex' ire, She seems a dragon with broad wings of fire, When through the regions of deep hell he flies, At Death's command, to search his enemies. The PhÅbe, Cherub, summon all their strength, And blazeâtheir distance scarce a vessel's length; Betwixt the three, thunder on thunder rollsâ The jarring earth seems loosen'd from the poles. By frenzied fire the bolts of wrath are drivenâ The ocean burns with solid flame to heaven. Were Hecla and Vesuvius side by side Of Ãtna plac'd, by earthquakes yawning wideâ And all, and each in height of fury rais'd, Each to outdo the other as it blaz'd: Scarce less terrifick would the conflict seem, Than the dread battle burning on the stream. Now by the turbulence the ships are hid; And now they show a blazing pyramid. But soon the smoke commixing with the fire, Smothers each vestige of their forms entire. A moment,âand a halliard breaks betweenâ Perhaps the motion of a flag is seenâ Instant the whole is muffled from the eye, Wrapp'd in the folds of deep obscurity: So when for many moons a drought prevails, By which the gushing of the fountains fails, The tender flowers sink drooping to decay, Beneath the fervour of the parching ray; At length at midnight in the south appears A chain of clouds which soon involves the spheres; Contending thunders in their anger peal, Which cause the pillars of the earth to reel, Whilst lightnings, kindling with incessant fire, Affright the world with apprehensions dire; A moment, now behind the clouds they hie, Which leaves obscurely seen the curtain'd sky, Deep, dungeon'd, dark, in awful tumult roll'd, Thick-crowding, broken, heaving fold on fold; But scarce a thought is to the mind allow'd, When the keen lightnings burn upon the cloud, Filling the circle of the heavens with blaze, Blinding the eye that ventures at a gaze. Like this, the streams of fire and thunders swell, The ocean spirits answer audible. Columbians, Britons, weltering in their gore, Close their dark eyesâto waken never more. A vengeful bullet leaping at Cowell, Fractur'd his ancle; brief from life he fell; The stream of life came pouring from the wound, And left his breast on Death's cold bosom bound. As Wilmer with strong arm his brass applied, A splinter smote and hurl'd him in the tide, Astounded with the blow which jarr'd his breast, He sunk without a struggle to his rest. Though Death has cast your bodies from the world, Your names shall live while ocean shall be curl'd By virgin zephyrs from the mountains west, Where large you drank the streams of Freedom blest. A wild, sweet musick from the sea shall rise To glad your Spirits sailing through the skies! No Patriot sinks aloneâthe royals die; Knap, Bufort, Elder, fall promiscuouslyâ And other names are stricken from the earth, While in their heat to urge the battle forth. At length the Cherub second time retires, Unable longer to withstand the fires Bursting from Porter's enginesâimpotentâ Her hulk in ruins and her cordage rent. The PhÅbe flinches backâbut Bradburn bold Inspires her crew the contest yet to hold: âBritons! stand firm, and in that firmness die, Rather than cowering from the scene to fly! Yea, thrice endure the exercise of death; Say, that we'll live, or find proud graves beneath!â This language stay'd the PhÅbe on the flood, Though her dark waist was overlaid with blood. Porter observ'd their failing, and begun: âBehold the thunders of the Cherub done! Standâand the foe must render up the fightâ The PhÅbe, see! exhausted of her might She flutters in the wind! She groans in painâ Yea, prove the soul, and we their flags shall gain! The canvass, spread it forth,âjib,âtop-sail sheet! Board, board the foe! The Lion's at our feet!â Instant the sails upon the ship they bend, But ah, too broken to retain the wind! Their buoyant hearts misgave them at the sight; Their hope of triumph darken'd into night. So the ship Hesper on the rocks was lost, Steering for Boston with her freight of cost; Her boat was all that liv'dâso dire the sceneâ And this was crowded with her hopeless men. In night,âwithout a compass for their way, They bound, uncertain, on the uproar'd sea; While thus bewilder'd on the billows driven, Behold the northern star appears in heaven! A rushing joy in every bosom crowds, To mark their compass shine between the clouds; But lo, while steering by the heavenly ray To seek the shelter of a friendly bay, A scowling cloud obscures the lovely light, Which wraps their promise in the pall of night. Thus sunk their hopes to mark the sail wings torn, Like shipwreck'd mariners in grief forlorn; Each soul o'erpower'd, reveal'd a reckless stare, Though breaking down beneath a dead despair. Now at this bleeding moment of distress, McKnight to Porter, offer'd this address: âOur gallant vessel in the strife is done; Her lastâlast particle of sand is run! Our guns are like the minute guns of death, While the foe strikes and settles us beneath; Our masts are woundedâtottering from their heightâ The cordage rent,âthe hulk in shatter'd plight; The deck is cover'd with the parts of men; The room of surgeons is a direful scene; And still, incessant, our companions fall, But yet they smiling meet their funeral! Behold! what flames come bursting from below! No hope remains, but yielding to the foe!â âYield to the foe!ânever while breath survivesâ How soon the race of man by nature dies! How few the days that we forestall of Time! To die in battle is to die sublime! âSee Odenhiemer, with unflagging zeal, Quenches the flames, that bursted from the keel! The hearts, that show such daring, never meltâ To mortal man such spirits never knelt. âBut mark you not, a gale like heaven has sprung! It wafts us to the shore! with feelings young, Urge on the lagging vessel to the strand, And spread the fire, and every hero land!â 'Tis doubtful, which most cheer'd the sinking crew, Or Porter's voice, or gales which favouring blew And bore the suffering Essex to the shores, While drops of blood run sweating from her pores, For still the PhÅbe kept a distant roll, Touching at times the centre of her soul! But the gale freshening, bearing her to land, Imparted vigour to her deathless band. Hope's rainbow'd visions in their beauty came To gain the shore, and light her in a flame. But ah, the wanton breezes shift their wing, And opposite the foe her length they bring, Helpless, expos'd to all the PhÅbe's fire, Piercing her lifeâincreasing in her ire! By this, the Cherub had her wounds made tight, And join'd the PhÅbe in the unequal fight; Both ships united, feel their strength sublime, T' erase the Essex from the book of time. Through every vein of life the Chilians ache; Heart-bursting sighs from every bosom break; Tears, rank with bitterness, proclaim their griefâ They see no hope, but yielding, for relief. Yet still with souls unconquer'd are the crew! Nor can the enemy their will subdue. A something more than mortal seems to live In Porter's eye, from which the brave receive An inspiration of immortal fireâ To die with him sublim'd is their desire! Lo, at this instant, like a ray from heaven, A daring thought was to the hero given: âTo anchor of the stern a hawser bend! Till the last struggle of our life, contend! From bows, the cable loose! Round poize her head, And cast a flame to strike the living dead!â Scarce had the order echo'd from his tongue, When at the foe, the deep-charg'd cannon rung. The Cherub, PhÅbe, trembled every gunâ In vain they strive the iron storm to shun; Blood, like new fountains, gushes every side; They fail, they sink, their decks are in the tide! Each moment threatens their expiring last, The Essex' thunders striking every blast! The gazing patriots, lifted from the earth, Shout to the glory of Columbian birth: âThe Essex conquersâgains the victory! Britannia sinks with all her infamy!â The shout was heard beneath the ocean's swell, Like bursting clouds, by monster Shape of hell; In serpent form he rose above the sea,â Beheld his vessels in extremity. âIs hell upon the earth?â (in dire surprize, Flashing red horror from his scorpion eyes;) âWhat, is the Essex strangling both of Ours? Is this the effort of the Albion powers? Noânever can it be!âWhat, twoâ âSwift We must goâ Or gone forever in the floods below!â This said; he backward darted in the deep, And plac'd his length beneath each sinking ship, And buoy'd them upâhis might so wonderful! Just as the waves were burying up their hull, And hurrying them to death!âHis vessels sav'd, (Though Ocean thought them in his empire grav'd,) Brief he contriv'd the Essex to subdue With flame, and bring despair upon her crew. The hawser first he sever'd with his teeth; And then, the vessel kindled with his breath! The brave stood cramp'd with dampness on their heart, When they beheld the last, last cable part; But when they saw the flashing from beneath, They felt the anguish that is felt in death! Porter exclaim'd: âThe standard, let it fly! We've glorious fought, and gloriously we die!â Scarce had he spoken, when a rushing light Stream'd down the heavens, and wrapp'd the flag from sight! The PhÅnix Eagle quicken'd from the pyreâ The Stars shot blazing from the hallow'd fire! Fredonia caught and plac'd them on her brow, And wide through heaven convey'd the splendid show! Her trump so sweet she sounded with her breath, It call'd bright angels to the spheres beneath: âEarth! list to the decree! Porter shall live, Whilst Fame immortal, has a breath to give!â CANTO XIII. SIEGE OF FORT MEIGS. ARGUMENT. At the opening of the second campaign, Proctor invests Fort Meigs .... Croghan proceeds to Sandusky .... A Night Scene. The events of this book are laid at Malden, and in and about Fort Meigs .... The time is twenty-four hours. The sun returning in his bright career, Gives gladdening promise of the quickening year; The flowery-footed Spring with all her train Of joys, and loves, comes sporting o'er the plain. The snows dissolve insensibly away; The ice turns liquid by the sun's warm ray. Unbound from winter's chain, the rivers move With silver bosoms through the budding grove; Through vallies teeming with the floral birth Of cowslips, vi'lets, smiling in their mirth. A robe of woven grass adorns the mead; An infant beauty o'er the earth is spread; The lambkins frolick in their youthful heat, The ewes loud call them, and they answering bleat. The heifer snuffs the essence of the gale, And strays to taste the sweetness of the vale. At sunny noon the bees are on the wing To sip the luscious honey of the spring. The fishes feel the renovating heat, And, light of heart, from winter caves retreat; The salmon flounces from his sea-weed bed, And darts the river to its fountain head. The trout, the swallow of the streamlet, flies, As blush of morning reddens in the skies; At noon he sleeps beneath the alder's shade; At evening frolicks in the rippling glade. The embryo blossoms of the orchard groves Show their red lips, like beauty when she loves, While songs, sweet-noted, warble from each spray, And hold the listener in soft ecstacy. Light marble clouds bedeck the orient heaven; Young life in rapture to the earth is given. Though Spring returns with gladdening smile of peace, And from stern Winter gives the world release, And with the musick of her mellow voice, Bids nature live, and in her life rejoice, Yet loud and martial round Columbia far, Sound the hoarse trumpet and the drum of war. And now, that Winter with his hoary train Of frosts and snows, had vanish'd from the plain, Proctor at Malden, at the purple dawn, Rose, and his squadrons rank'd upon the lawn, Ready to pass the lake and seize the fort, And give his name a more sublime supportâ Sublime in murder, not in valiant theme, But such sublimity as Raisin's stream. His numbers mate the buds upon the trees, Or hoarse collecting swarms of hiving bees; The scarlet Britons, dazzling on the sight, The painted Indians, clamorous for the fight. Thus savage bears, what time that winter raves, Lie chill'd and torpid in their darksome caves, But when the spring thaws out their frozen blood, They wake and raven for supply of food. So through the winter had the Indians slept, And scarce from out their dens their length had crept, Lock'd in unsocialnessâno converse spoke, Veil'd in an acrid cloud of stifling smoke; But, as the animating spring returns, Their fiery blood with inward vengeance burns. Lo, now a banner rising in the wind, They hush their broil till Proctor speaks his mind: âWarriors! whose bayonets vindicate the Throneâ And Brothers! long for deeds of daring knownâ Great is my joy to see your passions burn, To leave the winter and to blood return. Behold, in person, I command the field; Never I sheathe my sword till foes shall yield! Yea, we shall pour a blindness on their sight, And prove our flag Death's banner in the fight. âYes, should they dare resistance at the fort, 'Twill then sublimely with our views comport; For we unsparing will their lives consume; The whole Republick bury in the tomb. âWith warriors, you, Tecumseh, cleave the lake, And the west bank of the Miami take; In ambush there, your banded host secrete, To rise, and at a blow their lives complete; If past the river they from us should fly, You'll sharp your daggers for a butchery. âCawataw, you, and you, Tekelah good, Will land with me at sunrise from the flood; The fort surrenders ere the close of day; The Eagle flutters in her death away. âCherish in mind they tore away your soil; Now for the deed, let every blood-vein boil. Never the olive we present our foes, Till yield they north of th' Ohio flows. Drive but the vile intruders from the plain, And that vast country shall be yours again.â Thus spoke the hell-begotten, born of Sin; The savage heard, and smil'd a hideous grin, Expressing that which words can never tell,â Like that depictur'd in the pains of hell. They load the barges, sweep the waters o'er, And land, like swarming, on the freedom shore. Twelve hundred Patriots in the fort are all To play the brass and aim the rifles small; And had not Harrison, learning the fate Of bleeding Raisinâfrom Ohio State Procur'd and hurried the supplies and men, In infant weakness would the fort have been. The time that Proctor, with imperious pride, Drew forth his strength to navigate the tide, The venerable Shelby, silver hair'd, The fort defenders in it centre squar'd; His purposes proclaim'd: âThe winter gone, Soon shall we hear the martial beating tune Inviting us to arms. But Raisin's plain Compels us here defensive to remain, Till youthful Perry shall his ships complete, To bear us o'er, the allied host to meet. What though adversity constrains us now, Here to resist the inroads of the foe, Brown is preparing at Ontario's wave To cross with Chauncy and dig deep their grave. And doubt there cannot be, but now the height Of Queenstown shines with Liberty's pure light; Express to me has made it evident, That Renssclaer was moving the descent. âThe human soul is limited to timeâ When proud on reason's wing it towers sublime, Planning with wisdom for the future hour, To grasp its hope in fullness of its power, The shifting of a breeze, a song, a straw Will break its flight and prove how weak we are. âWe thought our plans with judgment deep were laid, That we, ere this, the Eagle had display'dâ But by the giddy changes of an hour, We stand in weaknessâwither'd all our powerâ âHow? wither'd!ânever! Though in numbers small, Our strength is ample to defend the wall. None more I wish, the enemy to check, Till Dudley shall arrive, their ranks to break; I've heard his passing of Ohio's flood With twice six hundred of Kentuckian blood.â The veteran chief was broken in discourse By Hamilton, returning with his force, Sent as a spy, should enemies appear, To bring the tidings to the General's ear: âWarrior of many fields!âtwo leagues below, In martial pomp, advance th' invading foe, Deep as thick mist, slow travelling o'er the vale, Borne on the pinions of the summer gale. Cawataw, I, Tekelah, Proctor, sawâ I search'd to find Tecumseh,âarm of war. But him, I not beheld. Elliot was dress'd In royal robes, more haughty than the rest. Reynolds and Muir, like stars mid clouds of night, Reflected on the host a partial light.â The herald ended. Harrison beganâ To spare the waste of blood renown'd the man: âWith modest deference to your judgment now, Would I propose retiring from the foe; With awe profound for thy superior age, These darkening thousands we can ne'er engage With shadow of success. Deep they'll surround This infant fortress, raze it to the ground. âI'd be the last to recommend retreat, If but a hope remain'd to shun defeat; Should we this small but patriot army lose, Then would the States be thus compell'd to choose, Or rush upon their steel and there be slain, Or yield our freedom to the foe again. âBut should we backward to the river Carrying River. hie, In safety we could shun the enemy; Protect the troops advancing on the rear, And by our prudence save our character.â Thus he. And Shelby then: âMost true, I feel Your heart is wedded to the publick wealâ In conduct, prudence is a polar star; But in this virtue we may go too far. 'Tis not to be disguis'd, that we severe Have lost by reckless passionate career. â'Twixt rashness, courage, wide is the extremeâ That brings defeat, but this substantial fame: Ever by courage, steadfast warriors tower, And stand superior to unmarshall'd power. 'Tis not to numbers that the victory's given, But to wise conduct, and the smiles of heaven. âWarriors! yea, more than ample is our force To curb this Proctor in his savage course. The hopes of Freedom on our arms depend; We stand a rock, our country to defend; If few our names, more worth shall we evince, And place our deeds on fame's proud eminence. Prove your hearts chorded with your fathers' nerve Never to shrink from danger, never swerve. Where danger comes not, courage ne'er is seen; The day of battle proves the souls of men. âThough even now, the enemy comes forth In multitudes to bury us in earth, Croghan to fort Sandusky must repair To guard the passage of the river there. âProceed, fair warrior,âstrike for volunteers, Twelve, ten times number'd, equal to thy years.â Straight at the order Croghan pass'd the lines, While Harrison to Shelby thus rejoins: âA leaden weight upon my heart I feel, Longer my thoughts of danger to conceal, Hence, on the principle of publick good, I must divulge what darkness I forebode; Wisdom is gifted with a patient ear, The calm opinion of her friends to hear. âAnd do you purpose that the youth should stand, If savage hordes should swarm upon the land? A single brass the bulwark would destroy, And cast in air the inexperienc'd boy. Yea, and I fear that we ourselves must die; My soul forebodes a horrid butchery! We need our every warrior for defence; It seems too daring to detach him hence.â âThis fear you not: In days of ancient Rome, When to her portals Hannibal had come, She with her Scipio despatch'd away A numerous army into Africa, By which bold act she elevated high Her eagleâand appall'd her enemy. âThe boy will mount his nameâPromethean sparkâ A beam of fire, inherited from Clark, Called the Hannibal of the West. His warrior uncle. Fearless he'll engage The prowling savage and subdue their rage.â They thus: while Croghan visited the line, The youths inviting to the bold design. His eye look'd brilliant like a star new made; A graceful sweetness in his features play'd; The blush was martial, deepâbut yet so rare, That Beauty strove to win a conquest there. âFor warriors suited to my years I comeâ Fall in behind the musick of the drum. Comeâand with me, a character support, By proud defending the Sandusky fort, Come every youth whose bosom beats to liveâ 'Tis offer'd now, bright glory to achieve. The angel bosoms of our loves will rollâ They'll sweet embrace us with delighted soul!â Scarce had his tongue proclaim'd the welcome news, When, rear of musick, fil'd the Pittsburg Blues; The next, exalted youths, estrang'd from fears, Of Petersburg, Virginia's volunteers. While Croghan leads the way, the drummers beat, And soon the complement is made complete; His youthful chieftains burning for their fame, In future ages to transmit their name; Meeks, Hunter, Johnson, Capt. Benjamin Johnson, of Boon County, Kentucky. in their pride appear, And Bayley, Anthony, with sword and spear; Dunkin and Ship, the banners proudly wave, Whose starry emblems animate the brave. Now his fair band like beauty he display'd, Bedeck'd with nodding plumes, white, tipt with red. The venerable chief with placid look, Wav'd his scarr'd arm, and to their bosoms spoke: âTo you have I submitted the command, That ye may prove the promise of the land, And high upon the laurell'd mountain stand! Make it fame's birth-dayâfar in time to live, And a new honour to your country give. âI feel your hearts:âwhen I in years was young, To strike for Liberty my bosom sprung; Nor was it long, before the period rose, Which offer'd battle to the enslaving foes; The summons caus'd my heart's best drops to thrillâ It flam'd my blood with fire unquenchable. âBut suffer not these thoughts to press too far; 'Tis yours, defensive to maintain the war; Strengthen the fort, and, with attentive eye, Mark well the movements of the enemy. In mind, conceive them ever in your sight, Then they'll surprise you nor in day nor night. And when they crowd the shore, your worth maintain, Should they like waves come pouring on the plain; Smother your brass till they shall strive access, Then let its voice your hearts' resolve express. âMy blessing now receive. My words obeyâ May fame attend you on the trial day.â As when a father gives his sons advice To shun the path of infamy's abyssâ Points to the laurel on the mountain height, Where Virtue sits enthron'd in amber light, Ready to place the wreath upon the brow Of those, who clamber from the vale below: With such solicitude the hoary sage Gave his instructions to the green in age, Who, while he spoke, stood silent in their gaze; But when he ceas'd, they echo'd forth his praise: âThy words engrav'd upon our hearts we bearâ And O, may heaven protect thee in its care!â The offering from their soul touch'd Shelby's form With glow exquisite, as when boreal storm Has rag'd a winter's day, but lo at even, Breaks and displays the angel robes of heaven. Croghan commands in centre of the line: âEach eye-beam steady to the right incline! By tens break off! The musick beat resound! Forward!â They move with spirit from the ground, Waving their banners as they wheel in file, Their features soften'd with departing smile. Soon as was lost the musick on the air, (While still unbroken was the martial square,) Brief was the veteran's order: âEach to post! Away! Behold the standards of the host Flicker in sight! And let them darkening pour, We stand a rock to break their flooding power.â The Patriots heard, resolv'd upon the war To stand, till death life's charter should withdraw. While this was passing,âwith a haughty port, Proctor advanc'd to overcome the fort; But far beyond its reach he stay'd his force, And call'd his chiefsâaddress'd them this discourse: âTransport your warriors, Elliot, o'er the wave; Be ready there, their stubborn hearts to grave; Against the fortress cast a breast-work mound, Early at dawn to strike it to the ground. Your fighting-men, Cawataw, on his rear Will move, to wield the battle-axe and spear; And should you there superior numbers need, Fly to Tecumseh with a tiger speed; Ambush'd he lies in yon deep vale of wood, Whetting his axe to search their hidden blood. âReynolds and Muir conduct your legions round, Rear of their flag, and let your brass resound, Unless the Eagle's wing shall flap the dust, Their swords revertedâin their scabbards thrust. âWith Chambers, I, upon their front shall stand With good Tekelah. Like an iron band We'll lock them here,ânone from the fort shall hieâ Whoe'er attempts itâon our steels shall die!â Each in due form complies: Elliot glides o'er Miami's stream and lands upon the shore: Cawataw follows, silent on the flood, His features working with the thoughts of blood. Reynolds and Muir proceed upon the rear; Proctor and Chambers on the front appear. Thus while beleaguer'd is the forted power, The royals feel their hearts' ambition tower: Their looks express impatience to behold The Stars sublime, in dark submission roll'd. With mouths half stretch'd, the savage, leaning bend, To see the Eagle from her perch descend; Uneasy gestures prove their fretting mind, That the proud bird still rides upon the wind. So mountain panthers, watching their repast, Of lambs, or spotted kids in covert fast, Move with soft breath and easy footsteps round, Contorting, crouching smooth along the ground; Their eyes reveal the raving of their maws To suck their blood and tear them with their claws. Not otherwise the druling savage seem To act the theatre of Raisin's stream. Elliot at length upon the adverse bank,â Cawataw's fighting-men on either flank,â In regal pomp his battle-line drew forth, And strove to smite the Eagle to the earth. The forted Patriots, as he circled round, Observ'd his motionsârivetted profound, That should he venture where their globes would reach, A wholesome caution to his pride to teach,â Hence, when he open'd with his line of fire, Ready they stoodâall anxious their desire To ply the matchâthe chamber'd dust to burn, And back their life to elements return. They bend their ears to catch the veteran's wordâ Who in the centre standing, bar'd his sword, And spoke them patience: âBe not hasty, menâ To me this warfare is a sporting scene; Against their efforts we securely stand; But soon their blood we'll sprinkle on the land. âBehold, unwary, in a cube they crowd! Advance the fire, and give them thunder loud.â The act was done before his word was coldâ The guns disgorging, ranks of Elliot roll'd Headlong to ruin,âpiecemeal every part, While some yet quiver, bleeding from the heart. The savage scatter with bewilder'd eye, And bear their slaughter'd with a howling cry. When Elliot hurl'd his vollies o'er the stream, The soul of Proctor mounted every flame; At times he thought he stood upon the fort, And, that the Indians had begun their sport; But when the heroes bade their engines speak, A ghastly paleness settled on his cheek; His soul sunk grovelling in the dust of earth; He felt the rotten fabrick of his birth. A bacchanalian thus, in heat of wine, With swaggering boasts the lineage of his line; And as the fumes pervade his reeling brains, Beyond the reach of thought his sumless gains; While thus he on the wing of fancy soars, Till he concludes his name the world adores, By falling from a precipice on high, He gains his reason with sobriety; His fancied grandeur passes like a dream; He views his nakedness and rags with shame: So Proctor when he saw the cannon's flash, Felt an ice feeling, cold as water's dash. At length, when rous'd his blood, to Chambers, Short, He gave instructions with a regal port: âIt seems yon mound retains a serpent's nest, Hence, we this night no thought must give to rest. âShort, this commission bear to Reynolds, Muir, That they intrench and make themselves secure Against the fortified. At day's first gleam, Their battering-guns explode with levell'd flame. Chambers, 'tis yours to draw the lines at hand, To bow their haughty standard in the sand. At equal distances three bastions raise, That at the moment Reynolds, Muir shall blaze, To let the mortars cast the shells to heaven, That down to death the enemy be driven.â Short pass'd the word to Reynolds and to Muir, While Chambers stood to make the front secure, Soon as approaching Night her veil should draw To hide his purpose of besieging war. Lo, now the lamp that burns with oil divine Drowns in the oceanâall its golden shine Fades meltingly away: but soon appear, A troop of stars in heaven's broad theatre, Partial conceal'd by floating clouds, as light As angel mantles, edg'd with spotless white. The royals soon their different works commence, None scarce breathe whispers, labouring for defence. With pointed instruments some break the soil; To raise and form the mound another's toil. They force their energies till chaf'd with heatâ Their panting bosoms bath'd in reeking sweat. Through embrasures, half form'd, the cannon grin, Ready at dawn explosion to begin. The meantime Shelby to each officer, These thoughts express'd to probe his character: âWhile night's deep curtain veils the prospect round, What daring chief will venture from the ground, And reconnoitre Albion's camp afar, To learn what method he intends to war; Or with his ladders to o'erleap the walls, Or them to batter with his bombs and balls.â Scarce his design the veteran warrior broach'd, When numbers anxious for their fame approach'd To search the enemy in darkness forth, And spread their names of valour through the earth. Payne, Bradford, Longham, Miller, Johnson, Judge John T. Johnson, of Georgetown, Kentucky. bold, And Campbell, Butler, Metcalf, Guin, enroll'd With those of honourâNearing, Stoddard tall, And Alexander, reckless of the ball; Each lays his claim of honour to engage, And courts the danger as a privilege. âBy lot must I this noble strife decide,â Shelby half tearful in his joy replied. Hasty within a canister he threw Ten blanks and oneâthe twelfth he gave their view, Then dropp'd it speaking: âWho this prize shall gain Shall rule the scout of night upon the plain.â In turn each hero for the number draws, As though his life depended on the cause; For, without fame, this life is small avail, Like a dull song, or thrice repeated tale. They draw with trembling bosoms. Lo, the prize Campbell receives, which ends anxieties; It touch'd him with a thrill through every part, Like a rich jewel to a miser's heart. In olden time his sire in battle stood With Shelby, Williams, and Seveare the good; And he, of late, had drawn his scimitar On the red fields of Mississinewa; But short and brilliant is his race on earth; The season rolls but once when heaven will call him forth. Six he makes choice, each gifted with a mind, Which nought but paralyzing death could bind; Clark, Jones, and Williams, Norton, Ellis, White, To give him succour through the walks of night. They gird their armour, battle-axe and sword; And now they listen to the veteran's word: âUse every cautionâevery act beware; Note every object as you onward fare; You'll estimate their numbers if you can, And who commands the left, and who the van; Where lie the savages, and who their chief, And what reserve is ready for relief. Be bold yet cautious, and your fame will rise, And be remember'd for the enterprise. The waning moon at midnight will appear, And then you'll hasten to rejoin me here.â âWe prudent thy instructions shall fulfil,â Campbell replies, âshould heaven but grant our will.â This said, he bow'd his sword and onward pass'd. Faint o'er the plains the stars a glimmering cast. While this transpir'd, Bratlet to Proctor came, (Th' intentions cherish'd in his breast the same) To whom he gave his views: âAnd would you know The numbers, strength, and purpose of the foe? Or whether he resigns,âor desperate bent, Will guard defensive his imprisonment?â Proctor quick answer'd: âWho, what man will dare To venture forth and gain the fortress there?â âThat venturer, I am he; yes, I dare go, And the whole secret of the fort I'll know; Their habits I can imitate so well, With ease can I my character conceal. This royal scarlet I'll exchange for blue, And then their dialect will bear me through. Without a stammer artful will I say, That I was captur'd on that slaughter day, When Allen bow'd to death,âbut now had fled While you were slumbering as though life were dead. This would our labours cover till the light Brought them to viewâcompleted for the fight. âThis plan my heart informs me will succeedâ Approve my purposeâI'll perform the deed.â Proctor rejoin'd: âBratlet, of daring men, More brave are you that ever I have seen. At your return large honours will be thine, You with proud gifts magnificent will shine.â The thoughts of regal bounties swell'd his pride; He doff'd his royal robes to be supplied With such as freemen wear. And false to show, He fix'd an eagle helmet on his brow; Breast-plate a star. A hunter's garb was thrown, Loose o'er his shoulders, that he might be known As native of Kentucky's fattening earth, Or that Ohio was his place of birth. Transfashion'd thus to the Kentuckian guise, With lofty stepping through the night he hies. The meantime Campbell, cautious, mark'd the ground. His ear attentive to each rustling sound; With bended eye he pass'd from left to right, Conceal'd beneath the growing shades of night. âListen! methinks I hear a stepping sound! Keep closeâcrouch lowâlie prone upon the ground. Hark! more distinct it strikes upon our ears! The moving shadow of a man appears! He seems though musing in a happy veinâ Silentâno whisperâlet him pass the plain. But at the moment he beyond us hies, Smother his voice, and seize him by surprise.â This soft he breath'd as Bratlet strode in view, While fancy's pictur'd visions round him flew; Musing delighted on his promis'd fame; The titles royal to salute his name. âIn honours shall I class with Wellington; Then, no inferiors will I look upon; The king will deign a smileâand London stare, And, pointing as I pass: âThat's Bratlet there, The knight of Meigs!âwith ornamental star! A prize his valour purchas'd in the war.â âDelicious sounds!âit ravishes my heart! What bosom can desireââ The Patriots dart, And seize him in his pride!â In golden wheat, Like him a peacock stepp'd with haughty feet, Arching his plumes; his wings hard swept the ground, His feathers trembling, buzz'd with humming sound. It happen'd that a fox was passing by, Who, couchant, mark'd him in his vanity, Ready to leap and seize him in his teeth, And bend him humble in the dust beneath; Lo, at the time he whirring wheel'd around, Reynard sprang forward from his hiding ground, And fix'd upon his throat!âhis plumes sunk low,â A trembling captive to his artful foe. Not otherwise the hopes of Bratlet fled; His heart ceas'd beatingâfor the moment dead. Campbell the motion of his tongue confin'd, His voice to smother from the telltale wind: âAttend me while I speak! But whisper loud, Your soul shall shriek on yonder midnight cloud! But thou shalt kindness from our hands receive, If equal favour you to us shall give; To be a captive is the fate of arms; But hold thy peace and cast away alarms.â This said; the muffle from his lips he took; Bratlet made answer while his knee-joints shook: âYour friend I'll ever be! My life but spare, And I will nothing of the truth forbear! Yea, should I not minute each purpose tell, You forth may slay me like an infidel. âProctor abides in frontâtwo thousand strongâ The same in number opposite belong To Elliot and Cawatawâbrewing spite, Tekelah rules a thousand for the fight. Reynolds defends the left, sustain'd by Muir, Outnumbering Elliotânames to long endure. Tecumseh stern, unconquerable in mind, Lies in deep darkness with reserve behind; Should Elliot succour need, he stands conceal'd To stretch your people cold upon the field. âHard now they labour breasted works to raise, Early at day upon the fort to blaze.â Campbell with promptness to his speech rejoins: âI did not urge you to divulge your lines; Your voluntary act. I pass'd my word, That I to you protection would afford; That wretch my soul abhors of human kind, Who treats a captive with a savage mind; But RaisinâO thy stream!â âThe thought expire! Nor rouse my bosom to avenging ireâ âI understand you, that the royals now Are at intrenchmentsâthither let us go!â He question'd for the truth. Bratlet replies: âI'll lead you to the tent where Proctor lies!â Campbell with frown return'd: âIt may not be A traitor heart to be a guide to me! âAt first I thought you overcome by fear; To guard your life, became a volunteer; Describ'd minute where your divisions lay, And what their secret purposes at day; But then a soldier, jealous of his fame, Would rather ask to plunge in melting flame, Than he the plans of warfare would discloseâ Spreading them open to his country's foes. â'Tis true, a man who trembles for his all, Might for the moment from his duty fall; And the sharp cruelties at Raisin's shore, Might start the life-streams back from every pore, Causing the blood to curdle at your fate, That we avenging would retaliate; But when sincere I plighted you my word, That I to you protection would afford, Without a motive you divulg'd the plan, Which prompts your army from its rear to van. âAh, but your soul fair Virtue doth defile; Hence, you forebode that others are as vile. âAt first, I purpos'd nothing to believe, For much I thought you labour'd to deceive, Till at this moment you'd direct the way To search for Proctor, and his friends betray. âThough that to me the information given Is precious, bord'ring on the light of heaven, Yet still my bosom feels the traitor vile, Causing my blood indignantly to boil; Worse than a serpent, secret in his wrath; Insidious winding, poisoning in his path. âWilliams and Newton, bear him to the fort And to the chief the circumstance report! But, Ellis, you and Jones, and Clark, and White, Will farther aid me to explore the night.â Newton and Williams to the veteran led The humbled Bratlet,âwhile with smother'd tread, Campbell proceeded to the Albion line, Where they intent were urging their design. They hear the mattocks as they rip the ground, And the rais'd earth that rumbles on the mound. Slow as they move, a serpent eye they keep, Watching the shadows of the midnight deep. A row of shining points they near descry, Which gives them note a sentry passes nigh, Obscure, like poplar broken by a storm, Man's height from earthâthus doubtful was his form. The burnish'd barrel of his weapon shows, As though a branch from out its side arose, And that o'erlaid with ice, from which the shine Of stars was back reflected in a line. Clark whispers Campbell: âMark that object there! A royal watch, that bids us to beware; I feel a stirring in my soul inclin'd To move without erupting of his mind, And seize and muffle, that no sound may rise T' alarm the foe, and break the enterprise. Secur'd he must be, ere that we can hope To pass beyond him to observe their scope.â Him, Campbell answer'd: âBy this elm we'll rest, While you proceed to compass your request; Notice, the top has a peculiar bent To be your guideâaccomplish'd the event.â Clark moves with heedful caution o'er the heath, By parts expiring and receiving breath; Now scarce he feels his heartâbut now enlarg'd With gladdening hope, and rushing blood surcharg'd, It strikes so strong and full upon his breast, He thinks the sound is thunder from the west. A tree, vexatious, intercepts his way, O'erthrown by lightnings in an ancient day; He feels his path, and inches by degrees; For he the guard so evidently sees, He apprehends his eyes would him remark, And aim his life and leave him in the dark. At length the tangling of the boughs was pass'd, Save one, but that, unhappy, held him fast! His heart that moment with rich blood was full, But now he thought the bullet touch'd his skull! His foot to disengage he turn'd him round, The brittle branch broke short!âwhich in its sound Seem'd to his ear more loud than thunder storms, When mid-day tempest heaven's bright face deforms. The Briton startled though a ghost had come To seize and drag him downward to the tomb! Wilder'd he erring at the object fir'd, And with hair straighten'd, from his post retir'd. Swift through the lines the sentries caught th' alarm, And by quick vollies notified to arm. The drums loud rattled,âsharp fifes whistled shrillâ Discordant voices echoed horrible. âSnatch,âseize weapons!â the officers command; âWhere rush th' enemy?â sounds through all the land. The instruments of toil are hurl'd away; But some in panick bear them for the fray. A horrid multitude, confus'd they fly, Grasping their arms to face their enemy. Proctor awakening midst the uproar'd sound, Abrupt exclaims; âIs hell upon the ground!â Elliot, the Indians on the flank and rear, Leap from their bloody dreams with howlings drear; The 'larum engines start the ear of night; Reynolds and Muir stand planted for the fight. So, late in Boston, when the night was still, A watchman standing on her State-House-Hill, Beheld a sparkle at a distance rise, Which soon enlarging flashes up the skies; Fire! fills his voice, which to a shriek he strains T' alarm the watches through the devious lanes; The nearest watchman hears the direful note, And forth the same is echo'd from his throat; Another, and another, and another screams, Till the dread tumult gains the far extremes. A various din comes pealing from the bells; The city wakening from its sleepy spells, Startles with wildness from its bed of down The raging element with floods to drown. The whirling engines o'er the pavement tear, A deafening sound convulsing on the air; The panick seizes on the old and young, The turmoil thickening with confusion's tongue, All ignorant, asking whence the flames proceed, As on they hurry with a panting speed. With such commotion swells the dire alarm Through every circle of the camp to arm. Meantime in safety Clark to Campbell came; And each, diverted, saw the passing game. âListen!â Campbell exclaim'd, âmethinks I hear The sound of carriage passing from the rear! Yes, through the night the cannon I perceive; An army now we'll make them to believe. Reynolds in hurry has despatch'd it forth, Proctor to save from falling to the earth. âBrief from the coward scabbard bare the sword. Ready to rush when I pronounce the word.â They draw their falchions at command, and lie In ambush, till the brass comes jolting by. âBattalions! strike the heart!â The heroes dash, Wielding their brands, with which death wounds they gash, Like four dark spirits leaping from a cloud, With spears of moon-beams lighting up the shroud. The Britons bleedâfour slumber with the dead, The rest surpris'd, stand overcome with dread. âYieldârender up the brass, or each shall die! For Raisin's blood your lives we'll crucify!â A trembling voice replied with bosom pent: âWe yieldâand crave thy anger to relent, Behold, our arms are broken in the dust! In thy protection merciful we trust!â âAnd never was that mercy crav'd in vain,â Him Campbell answer'd in the mildest strain. âNewton, in front of the escort proceed, And to the fort conduct them on with speed!â (With art the warrior made a lofty show In words, as if superior to the foe.) âWhite, Ellis, with your guards pursue their rear, While charge shall I, this savage Proctor here!â âGeneral!â (thus Newton echo'd the deceit,) âTo me no second time your words repeat. âBritons! observe my progress o'er the field, And know, my arm shall be your guardian shield, But should you vary from the onward path, Brief be your prayer, for sudden is our wrath.â No more is utter'dâfor they need no moreâ Newton they follow to the forted power; While Clark and Campbell in their place remain, Profound in silence on the uproar'd plain. Meanwhile the allies such confusion made, No echo reach'd them of what Campbell said. But soon they silenc'd, caution'd by their fears, Their eyebrows bent and listening with their earsâ Not daring movementâdubious of the way, That Campbell's army should their strength assay. Now Proctor, mounted, passing round the lines, This on his host repeatedly enjoins: âBritons! stand watchful!âevil is the hour, But let none doubt but we'll subdue their power; At stirring noise, or at the sign of flame, Let every Albion vindicate his name. Diverge the right wing, Chambers, to the bank Of the Miami to protect its flank. âWho would have thought they'd burst their prison doors In depth of night to strike us from the shores?â While Proctor thus to his battalions spoke, Campbell to Clark these observations broke: âAnd mark you not how solidly they form To brave the shock, should we with bayonets storm? But scarce can I presume that you, or I, Have strength alone to make an army die; Though much I doubt, that we in this shall bear, Yet still I feel to act upon their fear, By which we might their growing works delay Till Dudley shall arrive, Adair, and Clay.â He paus'd. And Clark with modesty began: âOur feats already have delay'd their plan; But obvious it is not, how we can more By artful enterprise disturb their power. What can our weakness 'gainst a host perform? An elephant as soon would crush beneath a worm. But could we secret wind upon their rear, We might, perchance, continue them in fear; But no vain circumstance will now suffice, As each stands listening for an enterprise; But what your pondering wisdom shall devise, To break the labour of our enemies, With best endeavours will I push the plan, In centre, or the wings, in rear, or van.â The time that Clark with Campbell thus conferr'd, Scarce by the chief a syllable was heard, So absent, musing in the depth of mind, Some better plan within himself to find. Like him, was Newton on his theory bent, Searching what cause upheld the firmament; Tracing the compass of the sun in heaven, The earth, the moon, the planets round him driven; Measuring the comets infinite in flight Through the deep darkness of chaotick night, From thence, he kenn'd them in his mental eye Through the waste regions of immensity; Vast as they wheel'd their mighty circuit round Back to the glory of high heaven profound, He mark'd the boundless ocean of their blaze, Which fill'd the race of mortals with amaze! While musing thus, with wisdom's light illum'd, He heard not thunder, with himself entomb'd. At length a thought, most obvious when it came, Shot through his mind like flashing of a flame; His thoughts far-stretch'd were roving o'er the land, While all the means were ready at his hand. So hunters, harness'd for excursion long, Enter the wilds with resolution strong; Pass down the valliesârise the hillsâdescendâ Ford the broad riversâround the ledges bend, Which hold the mountains up,âthen scour the plainâ But not the object of their toils they gain; At length exhausted by their vain pursuit, Back they return, their efforts to recruit; But lo, as they their starting place draw near, Close at the path they spy the herded deer, Which they had pass'd unnotic'd in their heat, In slumber crouch'd directly at their feet. Thus Campbell's mind, while labouring to conceive Some swift alarm with hurry to achieve, Had wander'd, like the hunters in the chase, While all the means were ready at his place. âHow truant are my thoughts! The cannon deep, Charge, and plant angling through their lines to sweep, Then let a slow-match to the prime bear fire, And while it sparkles, to the fort retire!â Scarce this design was echo'd from his tongue, When both excited with a feeling young, Prepar'd the brassâDeep in its womb they cramm'd The flaming dust, then hard the glut they ramm'd, On which, with labour that made short their breath, They drove with hollow sound the means of death; They prim'd the vent, and o'er it plac'd the fuseâ This done, they wheel'd it to effect their views. And now, while all is in expectance dark, Campbell from smitten steel emits a spark, Lighting the match-fuse with a hissing fire, And while it sparkles they to fort retire. The Albions on the watch quick caught the flame: âBehold the fire! With vollies smother them! Pour th' artillery forth! Life turn to dust!â As Proctor spoke, the pregnant cannon burst, Death in its sound! Five twenties felt no pain, And twice that number groan'd upon the plain! But soon the foe, recovering from the shock, With harmless war the shores of Erie rock. Thus when deep night pours down an opiate rest, A sable cloud, thick-rolling from the west, Breaks and lets blaze its thunder on the earth, To root the mountains from their place of birth; Bolt after bolt, with lightnings in their train, Drives through the heavens like fiery hurricane, Yet jar the mountains not,âfirm bas'd beneathâ Though oft they scath the stubble of the heath, And seem to speak the agency of death. Scarce with less turbulenceâless deafening sound, The Albions fight the air and unresisting ground! While thus the enemy their strength employ'd, The forted warriors the proud scene enjoy'd: âThis deed of Campbell will old Time defyââ Thus each the other strives in praise to vie, âThis night is his, his name to glorify!â At length the moon on Alleghany's height, Show'd her bent horns, and half dissolv'd the night; The royal pride was cast upon the earth, To see how empty was their strength put forth. So banded robbers break upon a store Of wealthy merchant for his shining ore; They seize a packageâbear it off with toil To their concealment to divide the spoil; In high expectance, lo, they burst the band, And find their treasure but a chest of sand! Their golden feelings are reduc'd to lead; They stand shame-smitten with their prospects dead. Thus, while the enemy the concave tore, They thought the patriots gasping in their gore, But when the moon expos'd the naked heath, Their haughty feelings lapt the dust beneath; They hung their heads dishearten'd with their shame, While each accus'd the other with the blame. CANTO XIV. DEFEAT ON THE MIAMI. ARGUMENT Reinforcements arrive from Kentucky .... The Fort is summoned to surrender .... Rombardment .... Elliot driven from his position on the west .... The ambuscade .... The death of Dudley .... A remnant save themselves by breaking through the enemy. The scene is laid at Fort Meigs and on the banks of the Miami .... The time is eight hours. When, by the moon appearing in the east, The foe, o'erspread with shame, his blazing ceas'd, Shelby, Harrison, by themselves withdrew, Their country's welfare ever in their view; To plan a method, Proctor to defeat, Or drive him back, or bring him to their feet. By balancing the weight of either side, In this position, they at length abide, Patient their active measures to delay, Till Dudley should arrive, Adair, or Clay, Of which eight captains out of twelve should land Where Elliot stood, and smite him with the brand, While from the fort a sortie should proceed And quail the foe, or in the effort bleed. While these events were passing, led by Clay, The bold Kentuckians had pursu'd their way; Dudley, then Morrison was next in grade; Meade, Murray:âTrimble was the general's aid, Since worthy found, and honour'd with a seat In Freedom's Hall, where sages, patriots, meet. Down the Miami in light keels they run To reach the foe, that had the murders done: And while that Shelby in his wisdom plann'd, And Harrison, to drive them from the land, Twelve furlongs, reaching from where Reynolds stood They leap'd to shore, rejoicing from the flood; And Trimble to the fort was sent to learn, Where they against the enemy should turn. As back from earth the shades of night were driven, The morn appearing at the gate of heaven, Trimble with jealousy the guards had pass'd, When backward they on their position fac'd; So soft, eluding, were his cautious feet, To watch his time that nothing should defeat The purpose of his heart to reach the fort, And bear the welcome message of support. Forth at his entrance he to Shelby strode, (His chiefs around) and thus his coming show'd: âI've pass'd, thank heaven, the dangers of the night, My tongue to you a promise to recite; A promise that my soul forebodes will be Fulfill'd with honour to thy memory: âDudley and Clay, with twice ten hundred men, Stand in drum beating on Miami's wave; I've come to learn what purpose you design, That they may form in ready decipline.â Thus he. And Shelby thus: âBold messenger, The tidings you've express'd delights my ear; Our minds have been impatient to receive Thy gladdening words to cause our hopes to live. âThis order you'll return: 'Tis my command, That Clay detach eight hundred of his band Miami to descend, and this, remark, That they, with arms unflinted, disembark, And search with steel you new-made batteries there, Then choke the cannon, and to this repair; For lo, Tecumseh is in ambush laid To watch each pass, and give the bulwarks aid. âHe with the others on his arms will rest, Till he shall hear their volley from the west, For, when detachment on the left shall land, Forth I design a sortie to command: At the same charge we Proctor shall attack, And with the bayonet drive his legion back; Clay then will pour his strength upon their rear; Kentucky yet was never known to fear. âBrief you'll return by yonder spreading beech, While through their works shall I attempt a breach; And artful thus divert them from the line, Where runs the path to favour your design.â Young Trimble press'd his hand and bow'd assent; Departed, for the beech his footsteps bent. The forted engines with combustion sound, And bring life's period to a narrow bound; The half-unfinish'd breast-mounds piecemeal tear, And hurl the earth with violence in air. The royals kindle all their fires at once; Death drove at death, destructions dire announce. Proctor discover'd to his sorrow soon, That all resulted to Columbia's boon, Hence, he the drums instructed forth to play To hush the broilâa summons to assay. The fife a moment strikes the promis'd key, Ere the drum echoes to its harmonyâ A musick sharp and piercing to the ear, When heard high noted in a circle nearâ Cuts through the organ of the brain a scream, Whistlingâbut soft, reflected o'er a stream. The drummers presently the beaters ply, Rattling the tune vibrating through the sky; To curb the wandering notes the time they beat By equal motionârising of their feet. Soon as the parley of the drums was done, To Chambers, Proctor haughtily begun: âHasteâand a banner to the fort display, And bid its chief surrender up the day; It nothing signifies the balls to blaze, Hence, we must plan to gain them otherways. Should he our summons disregard, why then, Threatening declare, we'll massacre his men; Yea, as at Raisin, not a soul shall live, For them, the whole, Cawataw shall receive!â Chambers in silence with the flag advanc'd, On which full soon the eye of Shelby glanc'd, While on the parapet with pondering mind, He stood to learn what purpose was design'dâ His wonder grew when Chambers reach'd the fort. And told his coming with a conqueror's port: Shelby had thought, that Proctor wish'd to gain A truce from battle, till he'd tomb'd his slain. âChief of the starry banner! lo, I come From royal Proctor to proclaim thy doom; He, fix'd in purpose, bade me to declare, That, longer if yon Eagle rode the air, He, with his thousands, will the fort destroy, And give the scalping savages employ! But O, resign!âhis tender mercy then, Shalt thou receive, and all thy helpless men.â A hectick flush'd upon the veteran's cheek Mix'd with the lily pale,âunpower'd to speak. The thought of Proctor's mercy touch'd his heart, Something of ire, which made his frame to start; The tide of blood produc'd the crimson air, But soon it fell and left the lily there. âHis mercy! O, why breathe it to my soul! It makes my blood through hurried veins to roll. Soon would the liquid of my heart be flame, Did grief for slaughter'd friends not cool the stream. âWhat! Proctor's tender mercy! Gracious God! Heâwhose delight is massacre and blood! Talk you of Proctor's mercy? O the shame! Mercy!âhis mercy would deep hell defame! Compar'd to him, the savage name is whiteâ Yea, as the rainbow to eclipse of night. âHath he not heard our matrons shriek in death? Seen hungry flames suck out the virgin's breath! Hath he not listen'd to the infant's pain, Their warm, live bowels twisting on the plain! Hath he not smil'd to see the best of life Melt into dust by the infernal knife! âMuch sooner shall the scorpion lose his sting, And be as gentle as the lamb of spring; The condor cease upon the dove to prey, While with sweet note she coos her amorous lay; The leopard lose his stains by nature given, And be as spotless as the face of heaven; Or the fierce tyger, madded as with fire, Be as the kid, that bounds with young desire; Than Proctor's heart will ever change its steel, And the soft touch of weeping mercy feel. âAvoid my presenceâvanish and retireâ My soul I feel ungovern'd of its ire! Comeâlet his thousands come,âdark, black as clouds in heaven, Back from this earth my soul shall ne'er be driven! âBefore I'd yield this monster-man my power, Whose tender mercies unwean'd babes devour, This hand shall light the magazine beneath, And roll both armies in the flames of death!â As when a cloud, on wings of darkness driven, Smothers the sun and all the face of heaven, The wary hunter marks th' approaching blast, And flies to shelter with his soul aghast: Thus deep his frown, while he in anger spoke; His voice like thunder through the darkness broke. His eyes search'd Chambers' heart, like lightning, through, Which, at the time, was damp'd with bloody dew; His joints were threadless as relax'd by death: He left the parapet half robb'd of breath. At once the Albions rouse themselves to war; Dread in reply Columbian thunders jar; Forth leap the globes, excited by the flame, And many a warrior ends his life with fame. Bombs, like star-pestilence, at each are driven With hissing fires, that wander over heaven. For five long hours, thunder on thunder breaks, But none yet wearied with the combat shakes. Meantime Tekelah from his warriors cull'd Those who for nimble efforts had been school'd, And led them near the fort with crouching sly, Where pines and lusty oaks invade the sky, And overlook its walls;âon these they climb With feather'd shafts, and gain their tops sublime. Their course they crept so secret through the grass, That none within the fort beheld them pass. As high they clomb with caution, by degrees Their forms were hid by intervening trees. No eye observ'd them till their bows were bent With steel-crown'd arrowsâthirsting to be sent Through life's warm fountain. Dark the savage stood, Obscur'd behind the body of the wood, All, save their forehead and a half-seen eye, To drive the arrow to its destiny. Jarvis, a youth, was first to mark their rise; He sought the chief,âimpatience in his eyes, And thus with hurried voice: âBehold them there, With arrows looking downward from the air! See how they benââ No syllableânot one, He added moreâfor lo, his life was done! Deep through his crown, where shone the pearly skin, The feather'd shaft with fatal strength went in; Glanc'd through his brainâthe jaw inferior broke, As he, pronouncing, had the word half spoke. Thus a young willow, on the lake's fair side, In spring puts forth its tender leaves with pride; Lifting its head rejoicing in the sun, A whirlwind snaps it and its life is done! To mark the young plant fade, the aged drew A sigh of sorrow deepâbut arrows flew Like trains of lightning, shooting through the sky, Wrapp'd in the foldings of obscurity. The peril check'd his grief;âand forth his tongue, To warriors, keen of eye, commanding rung: âTo this, the rifles in their haste repair, And stop the shafts from flying in the air! But stand in place till they expose their eye, Their arrows to clance with certainty, Then, with quick sight, draw fire upon the lead, And drive the bullet through the half-seen head.â Forthwith the patriots, habited in green, Wheel and advanceâtheir eyes, like lynxes, keen; Their left-hand fingers on the guard they place, The same arm crowds the rifle to their face; The left, extended firm, sustains its weight, Or moves,âits far extreme to regulate; With head declin'dâleft eye from vision hid; The right keen bent upon the silver bead:â Instant it glimmers opposite the foe, The ready finger lets the death-spring goâ The flint darts forward, driven by the lock, Fleeter than thoughts, that the conceptions mock; Batters the cover that conceals the prime, And throws it back in momentary time; The flint, conflicting with th' opposing steel, Flashes the sparksâthe sleeping death-grains feel The glowing particles, and burn to life With speed of lightning in a thunder strife. The bullet quickens at the touch of fire; Stung with the smart, it leaps with mad desire To cool its anger in the savage blood, As down they sight their arrows from the wood. With mortal efforts hard the oaks they grasp, And sweat and struggle with a dying gasp; By fingers, spasm-cramp'd, they hang in air, And, by the touch of death, they shiver there; But when their fountain streams forbear to flow, They fall as dead things on the plains below. Moss, bark, and leaves, thick follow their descent, Which they in falling shatter'd as they went, And partial hide them, ghastful as they lie, Their skulls deep enter'd o'er their dexter eye. Thus did the rifles toil, whilst deep and dark The cannon bursted, kindled with a spark, Touch'd to the vent, loud roaring up to heaven, Deafening like thunder o'er the welkin driven. At length both armies, wearied with the toil, With one consent, remit the furious broil. The patriots forth, unbroken in their soul, Soon make the ploughings of the cannon whole. This doneâof strengthening viands they partake, Ready with brand on royalty to break, When the battalions from the ranks of Clay Should landâand Elliot with the steel assay. While these events with either host transpir'd, Trimble pursued the happy path desir'd, And pass'd the warring enemy unseen, And join'd his ranks display'd upon the green. His chief he found pavilion'd on the bank, With whom was Dudley, of inferior rank, But not of soul, him liberty inspir'd Deeds to perform, which honour'd name acquir'd: âLo, these instructions I from Shelby bring, To waste the banded legions of the king: âHe bids you sort eight hundred warriors strongâ Those that have blood within their bosoms young, And, on the west, the enemy attack; Routâspike the cannonâthen the path retrack. For lo, Tecumseh, with a numerous host Valiant in arms, who never battle lost, Lies in reserve, and bids you to bewareâ Elliot, Cawataw, hold the bulwarks there. âNow when this troop upon the west shall land, The fort in sortie strikes th' imprisoning band; Presently when you the strife shall hear, Rush with your armsâpour slaughter on their rear. Reynolds we dreadâcompel him to retire Before the burning of a chain of fire. âBoth armies now in fierce contention raise, Reaching to heaven a solid wall of blaze.â Trimble, when seatedâDudley modest, then: âI plead for conduct of these chosen men; True to the order, I'll effect the stormâ Silence the holdâand then retreat in form.â âI grant your daring purpose,â Clay replies; âYou know the circumstanceâwhere danger lies: Strive to suppress the ardour of your force, Who deep remember Raisin's bloody course. The vents confine with steel, then brief retire, Or by Tecumseh will your strength expire. Goâlead your warriors in the path of fame, While I, the rear shall charge, of Albion's name.â They riseâand forth their willing ranks divide, Their every bosom fill'd with valour's tide. Twelve hundred on the right remain with Clayâ Two thirds that number Dudley's voice obey. Thus he salutes them: âCandidates of fame! In glory's field we this day lift our name, We storm the bulwarks on the western shore, Where Elliot and Cawataw hold their power; Silence the gunsâthe conquest not pursue, For lo, Tecumseh ambush'd is in view. Not in your hearts let too much fire prevail,â Attend my voice, or we in dust shall fail. Let every warrior, at the sign, retreat, Or all our fame will darken in defeat. Let your advance be chain'd in links of fire; When spik'd the guns, like gather'd mist, retire. Mark the instructions! To the stream awayâ With charging steel we glorify the day!â The Patriots heard, and shouted to the sky: âLead us to battle where the murderers lie!â Forthwith they press the barges, and descendâ With hearts high bounding, on the land they bend. Coombs, Trimble, Murrayâin the bloom of years; And Meade, and Morrison, Cox, Boswell, Spears. âKentucky! form the column on the right!â Dudley proclaim'd. 'Twas rapid done as light. âThe name of Simpson is the rising word! Trust not the flint! Let death be in the sword!â âSimpson is death!â They shouted high, and rose Horrid with steel, to mingle with their foes. Meantime, without a thought of danger nigh, Behind their earth-walls was the enemy; Cawataw first discover'd it in sight, And thus to Elliot he: âThey come in fight! See, from the river, how in steel they rise! Let big gun burst, out-thunder, split the skies!â Him, Elliot answer'd smooth: âDream not of fear; None of Kentucky dare assail us here; Unwary let them come, these heights to scale, We'll cast them tempest-fire with leaden hail. One blast will overcomeâ âBehold, they form, Like clouds collecting mountain heights, to storm! Let blaze the cannonâbarrell'd weapons allâ Buryâconsume, sweep down with grape and ball! Behold, they rise in solidness with awe! With thunder cover them,âroll down the war!â The cannon felt the sparkle-fire and spoke With bellowing tongue and roll'd the heights in smoke; In concert dire the lead-drove muskets pealâ But Freedom presses on, a moving ridge of steel! Thus when from ocean rolls a storm of clouds, Thick'ning and deep'ning, each the other crowds, Till one black mass involves creation whole, Awful in fashionâheaving roll on roll; But lo, the sun emerging from a fold, Thron'd high in heaven, emits a shower of gold, Which bathes the cloud above with streams of light, Whilst all below is one black scene of night: Such the pure brilliance of its brow on high, That angels gaze with wonder in their eyeâ While such the darkness of the cloud beneath, It seems as curtain'd with the pall of death. So deep below, and black the column move, Whilst gleaming steel illumes its path above. The allies battle at the brave in vainâ Behold, the summit of the height they gain, And plunge with whetted bayonets on their foes, Who fly the battlements, like whirling snows, When boreal blasts descend upon the earth With all the muster'd fury of the north. âUnpower the cannon!â Dudley spoke. 'Tis doneâ The vent is chok'd with steel, of every gun. âNow lock the ranks, and to the fort retreat! What deafs your ears? Progression is defeat! Attend my voice! Dread heaven! if you press on, Death swallows all!âforever lostâundone! Why stay you not?âdestruction hovers nigh! I will be heard! the man that moves shall die!â As when a vessel in her sailing pride, Assays to stem the Mississippi tide, But ah, the gales too weak apply their force To urge it up against the current's course; The powers a moment equal strength maintain, The ship stands balanc'd on an even strain; The waves descending, on her progress bear While the faint breezes just retain her there. At length the dashing waters turn her prow, And down she settles with the stream below. So Dudley strives his reckless band to stay; They hear him onward like the stream away. The ocean when it foams in all its wrath, Is smooth and gentle to their raging path. âRaisin! its massacre!â they shouting cry; âThe blood of Elliot or eternity!â Meantime Tecumseh, in concealment, stood Deep in a valley of embowering wood, Silent, but thoughtfulâcentred on his mind, To catch the smallest whisper of the wind. Soon as he heard the battle-breaking sound, He form'd his savage men in circle round; Frightful their visagesâred, blue, and black, With fury whetted for the dire attack. âHark! hear the echo of the war at hand! Now every warrior do as I command. See knifeâsee tomahawk, for blood prepar'd; Me lift my voice, let every chief regard; Break to the battle like big rolling cloud; Like deep-mouth'd thunder sound the war-whoop loud; Crimson earth's bosom! Strike, strike deep for bloodâ Large let it stream, like rivers in a flood. âBut when they ask for peace then spare from deathâ He dies, who scalps the wounded on the heath! Though Proctor bids, to naked leave the whole; Tecumseh spares who bends to his control. The blood of feeble never stain'd his hands, Nor shall it stain a warrior he commands. âListen!âthe war comes bursting on us nigh! Retire! Me speak, let death-note split the sky!â The circle instant vanish'd from his sight, As shades are scatter'd at th' approach of light. Meanwhile Kentucky, urging their pursuit, Laid many a savage with convulsions mute; Headlong they rush'd, with vengeance for their guide, Till they for murder should be satisfied. The speed of Elliot passes by the wind; The sound of Raisin chills upon his mind; Like him a culprit, moving to his death On the lone common, or the wizard heath, Deep in his ear-drum thinks he hears a bell, Tolling his funeral to the vaults of hell. Close on his path the wild men roar aloud, Deafening the woodsâa thunder-broken cloud. Soon near they gain upon the ambuscade, Where the dread chief in silent watch is laid: His warriors round, in couchant posture lay, Like hungry panthers, druling for their prey. One eye is bent upon their chief to mark The sign to rise,âthe other, like a spark, That burns upon the end of lightning chain, Observes the bands of Dudley on the plain,â For now obscure, through blinding woods they spy The reckless train come rushing on to die; But think they nothing of the savage tomb, Ready to open and decide their doom. Behold, the signal of their death is given! Tecumseh's voice peals audible to heaven. The other voices, though they hideous jar, Urging the tumult violence of war, Are like the drums that sound the muster roll, To solid thunder bursting from the pole. So dire the yellâso grim the savage air, Kentuckians stand and gaze upon despair! As when, (day glimmering on the skirts of night, And many a star looks pleasant with its light,) Hounds of sagacious scent awake the deer, Starting the chase with well-known accent clear; The listening hunter hears th' inspiring strain, And to his charger loosens all the rein; The noble steed disdains the goading spur; The hounds in musick, make his spirits stir; Snorting he leaps and snuffs the fresh'ning gale, Which lags behind him as he sweeps the vale. As loud, more loud, the opening pack he hears, He pricks more keen the sharpness of his ears; They scour the country round o'er hill, or dell, With different echoes, as they sink or swell. At length from craggy precipice on high, Down leap the deer, the hounds pursuing, die! The courser thunders on with uncheck'd force, Nothing to stay the fury of his course; Gaining the steep, he stops upon its verge, Sudden! Dismounts his rider with a surge: Foaming,âwith head thrown back and mane in air; Straining his eyes with a distorted glare; Shivering convuls'd upon the brink of death, Standsâstruck with aweâholding his mighty breath. Or as a vessel in the northern seas Bounds with full sail before the hurrying breeze; The skilful pilot warns the crew in vain Of Norway's whirlpool on the treacherous main; But they, unmindful of the caution given, Pursue their course till in the whirl they're driven! Ah, then they mark a dreadful something strange, Twinge through their blood to feel the whirling range. They hear the monster in the deep rocks yell, Like some dark spirit rising out of hell! Near and more near, the forceful suction draws The struggling vessel to its gaping jaws! Though wide the circles from the centre sweep, Yet, at each compass of the hopeless ship, More short and rapid are the whirling rings, Hurrying the vessel to the narrowings. Alas, before the vision of the crew, The gulf appears, appalling to their view! The trembling bark but lives another sweep, Before she sinks, eternal, in the deep! With eyeballs glaring, and tight-straining breath, They stand and shiver on the verge of death! So when Tecumseh with a shout arose, Which seem'd to wake the dead from their repose, The band of Dudley in a panick stood; Their palsied hearts forgot to stir the blood; Death, grim'd with gore, stalks round with hideous airâ But lo, they quicken from their dead despairâ And rise in all their majesty of soul, And back the vollies on the savage roll! The face of light a gathering darkness shades; On heaven the thickening turbulence invades. As when the vapours of the ocean rise Round Alleghany's tops, that touch the skies; Deep gathering into clouds, slow moving round, Which wrap the mountains in a gloom profound: At length surcharg'd they burst in ceaseless shower, And soon a thousand streams begin to roar; Outswell their barriersâsweep whole herds and flocks, And dash them headlong o'er the pointed rocks; Chafing with whirlpools, maddening on their way, They rage and thunder to their parent sea. Such the wild tumultâsuch the deafening noise; The strife augmenting with the savage voice. At length, such numbers of the allied power Hem in the brave, and kindle such a shower Of raining fire, the patriot ranks give way; Despair returns,âtheir hearts made cold like clay. But Dudley wields his dripping brand on high, And lifts them up beyond mortality: âCharge through the circle! Break the ring of death!â The fainting catch the spirit of his breath, And plunge upon the foe with pointed steel, Which makes the circle, binding them, to reel. A host of Albions gasping find their rest; Blood spouts hot leaping from the savage breast. But yet Tecumseh and Cawataw stand, And join the fracture, where the charging band Break down the links of the tremendous chain, Which binds the struggling heroes on the plain, Or wall of fire, in solid blazing vast, While death in smiles is seen upon the blast. âBreak through, nor think of life!â Dudley exclaims: âWith hostile blood extinguish,âquench the flames!â The time he spoke, from earth he seem'd to tower, As though his form were some superior power; The foe stood cramp'd, yea, motionless with dread; He smites the living, leaps bounding o'er the dead! Now, where Tecumseh, where Cawataw stood, He urg'd the pass, all dabbled o'er with blood, For many a partial wound unnotic'd drains The little streamlets of his heated veins. Lock'd was the passage that Tecumseh held; And on Cawataw back he desperate wheel'd. But the stern savage, as the hero came, Quick bent his rifleâtouch'd it to a flame, And sent the bullet glancing through his side; Its burning anguish chaf'd his heart's brief tide. So when a cougar feels the hunter's dart, Avenging blood runs burning through his heart; He tears the earth,âthe oak before him fallsâ His eyes flash wrath like heaven's red meteorous balls. Thus Dudley maddensâwhere his blade sweeps round, Black piles of dead lie smoking on the ground. Lo, now he meets Cawataw eye to eye, Which show like stars when skirted lightnings fly; They front upon the heath in darkening form, Like two tall rocks midst ocean wreck'd with storm. A moment, and his axe the savage drew, And pois'd it high as Dudley's falchion flew; Sheer through his skull the glittering ruin sped; His brains gush outâhe plunges on the dead! The sword firm-wedg'd, within his skull remains, For Dudley's strength forsook him on the plains, By which the blade was loosen'd from his handâ He reels, he faints,âno longer can he stand; His heart is drain'dâextinguish'd are his firesâ Stretch'd on Cawataw his proud soul expires! A woodman thus to fall a mountain oak, With heavy swing redoubles stroke on stroke; A hunter calls him offâhe leaves it there, Half throughâits honours waving in the air: But soon exhaustedâall its juices spent, It groaning falls and shakes the element: Thus Dudley fell majestick in his fameâ And unborn ages will revere his name. Where Dudley fell, a narrow pass was made, Through which the patriots, toiling with the blade, Hew'd out their way beyond the savage chain, And breath'd a moment on the open plain; To make the river, now is all their aim, To seek a rescue from the favouring stream. Cox, Murray, Trimble, were the happy three, Leaders of fame, that broke the enemy; And Meade beyond the savage line had pass'd, When lo, a lead was from a rifle cast, Which, in a line, burnt searching through his eyes, And left him blind in gory agonies! Yet still his soul in every action great, Without a groan endur'd th' afflicting weight. Murray and Trimble caught him by the arm To bear him onward, with affection warm; But Meade requests they leave him in the wood: âPut off this tendernessâwas death withstood? Look back and see what millions, that inspir'd The breath of being, have from earth retir'd! Your graves, perhaps, are distantâmine hath come; Think not of meâI would not stay my doom; I'm but a clog, and fetter your retreat; I scarce would live, could I command my fate. âWhen thou, my wife shalt meet, O tell her thisâ 'Tis all I askâwith grief 'twill mingle bliss: Tell her that though in dying I was blind, Her lovely image dwelt upon my mind; Methinks I feel her hand upon my breast, Soft as an angel's soothing me to rest! âWe meet in heaven.âHark!âhow the yells resound! The savage come to compass you around!â The time denied to answer him a word, For lo, Tecumseh, brandishing his sword, Came sweeping on with all his train behind, Whilst tyger howlings tore along the wind! Tecumseh knew not at the moment first, That, where Cawataw stood upon his trust, Was broken by the brave, himself subdu'd, And, for the grave-worm, a delicious food; But when the turbulence was pass'd away, And smoke and dust, that blotted out the day, The cause was open to his judgment seen, And to the river, through a deep ravine, He led his warriors. Having gain'd the van Of Trimble's flying ranks, he wheel'd his clan, And met them, hideous, with the scowl of death, Like some fell ghost, that strides the midnight heath! Hope vanish'd from the brave, like gold dreams rare, And left behind the darkness of despair. Death shook his barbed dart on every sideâ The thought of life within their bosoms died! But Trimble, rising, animates the brave: âWith one proud effort sink into the grave! Unfoldâmake manifest the Spartan worth, Whose names will find eternity on earth! Prove to the world, Columbians dare the same, Crown'd with Leonidas in deathless fame; On Freedom's altar let our bodies die, A bleeding sacrifice for Liberty!â They kindled at his voice with heaven's pure fire, And as they rose, cried: âLead us to expire!â As mountain billows roll upon the shore, Driven by tempests, mix'd with thunder's roar; As rocky shores resist the waves in storm, Lightnings and thunders, and the whirlwind's form: Thus Freedom chargesâthus Tecumseh stands, A burning pillar midst his warrior bands! But what can deeds of desperation stay? With three times fifty, Trimble smites his way! The rest lie mix'd with savage monsters slain; Some fled to heavenâsome weltering on the plain. Meade yet had life!âTecumseh saw him blind, And pity came and melted down his mind: âTecumseh, I am he!âHis soul remark,â He shines a light to travellers in the dark! Me guide you safe to yon big oak in heavenâ To cool your blood, there water shall be given.â Meade heard his voiceâand now his hand he felt, Which caus'd the life-cords of his heart to melt; Silent he follow'd his majestick guideâ At length he gain'd his utterance and replied: âGreat chief of noble mind! I now would live, That I might show you what my heart would give; The world would feel its shame, could I declare. A man of nature, with fraternal care, Proffer'd his hand, a blessing to supply; A guiding angel to blind misery!â Such was their converse, while Tecumseh led The sightless warrior from the field of dead; Full in the breeze beneath a shading oak He sat him down, remote from noise and smoke; But ere Tecumseh could the draught provide, His blood grew chillâhe sunk away and died. Meantime, Cawataw's clan, t' avenge his death, While flames appear'd to issue with their breath, Rush'd like a whirlwind on the hapless brave, To scalp and massacre with lingering grave. Grim Mai Pock heads the band, whose lurid eye Shoots the dire glance of savage cruelty; A panther's hide hangs o'er his shoulders fellâ His painted features show the work of hell; Fast in his belt the murder'd scalps are tied, From which blood, oozing, trickles down his side; The thunders of his voice the concave rend; He comes all dreadful, like a roaring fiend. The hideous monster makes a sport of life, For, as he wrathful plunges in his knife, He stamps his heel beside the gaping wound, To see the blood spirt upward with a bound! Murray lies bleeding by the side of Coxâ Fierce with hell rage, he fixes on his locks, And drags him, foaming, o'er the piles of slain, While his fair body writhes along the plain; The youth expiring gasp'd, deform'd with gore, Then roll'd his eyes to heaven, and view'd the light no more. So, for his pastime, a rude stripling tears A lilac, blooming in its tender years; It weeps a sorrowing dew upon the earth, To be thus broken in its days of mirth; A fragrance rich as heaven, breathes every flower, Whose purple tints outvie the new-born hour. Its charms the little truant's breast exciteâ He views it o'er and o'er with new delight; But soon, the flower his wayward fancy cloysâ Lost its late beauty and bewitching joys. Neglectful of its sweets, he whirls it round, And trails its loveliness o'er miry ground; It fades, it languishes, it wilts, it dies,â The urchin smiling at the sacrifice. Thus Murray faded in his youthful bloom, And sunk, unlovely, in the gory tomb. Tecumseh heard the massacreing strife; The grating sound of battle-axe and knife; Backward he flew, indignant at the scene, To save from murder's thrust the weltering men. He met with Mai Pock on the carnage heath, Scalping the dying, as they choke for breath! The lightning passion of Tecumseh flash'd, And at the fiend with tyger strength he dash'd; His brand descending cleft his skull in twainâ Grim Mai Pock falls and bites the gory plain, His hands convulsive grasp the gouted bloodâ His eyes roll strangled, 'neath the sanious flood, Which foams like matter from a dÃ¦mon's skull, Crowding his eyeballs with his warm brains full. Tecumseh thunders forth: âNo Indian dare To lift a knife, the scalp from skull to tear! Mai Pock behold! and fear to meet the dead, Not dare lay finger on a warrior's head? Tecumseh's hand sustains a bleeding foeâ Quick death is his, who smites another blow! Me hate the cowardâtimid, like the deerâ But joy is mine, in battle day severe, To meet Kentucky strong, a mountain oakâ It never bendsâit breaks by lightning stroke!â His voice struck terror through the savage lifeâ They stood in muteness and withdrew their knife. The dying Patriots view him with an eye, That shows a tear of angel purity; Faint as their pulses ebb to dusky death, They lisp his virtue with their failing breath: âOh had we power to utter what we feel! But ah, life ceases!âyet, with blood we'll seal That speechless glow of heart, which tongue hath given A name, but not the thingââ They die,âthey visit heaven! CANTO XV. SORTIE FROM FORT MEIGS. ARGUMENT. Simultaneous with the Assault on the western bank of the Miami, a Sortie is made from Fort Meigs, which is the subject of the present Canto. The scene is laid in and about Fort Meigs .... The time is about six hoursâfrom Dudley's landing on the west, till night. When of their cheer the forted had partook, Shelby to Miller of Ohio spokeâ Miller of Hampshire at Quebec was chain'd, The work of Hull, by which the land was stain'd With mark so deep, that thousand years of dew Will never bleach the canker spot from view:â âMiller, the charge is thine. Haste and display The warriors ready for the bold assay; Soon, opposite our banner, strike the shore, Then, rush we forth, and Proctor overpower: By which, diversion from the west we'll make, And force th' invaders back upon the lake; Let nothing of the drum or fife be heard, That no mistrust be in their bosoms stirr'd.â Miller, obedient at the summons, rose, To each the daring purpose to disclose; To Stoddard, Ritzer, Johnson, John T. Johnson. Sedwick, Todd; Ball, Metcalf, Alexander, Bradford, Wood; And thus to them in turn: âYour cohorts form, Ready with steel besieging powers to storm; Time hurries brief, when we expect to mark The barge descend to mount yon bulwarks dark.â Immediate at the word each chief obey'd,â Soon stand the squadrons in deep rank array'd; Their burnish'd arms like gleaming ice appear, Flashing broad day upon the sight severe. And now the veteran, crown'd with hoary hair, Forward advances with majestick air To give an inspiration to the band, Strengthening the heart to do the bold command: âColumbians of the North! born free, as brave! Are ye not weary to be bound a slave? And will ye, felon-like, in prison lay, With scarce admission to the light of day? Noâneverârise and break the prison doors, And dash the foe impetuous from the shores. When land our brothers to assail them west, Then rush with steel and plunge it in their breast; Now to your sons a noble fame bequeath, And round your brows unfading laurels wreath. âIn two divisions let the war commence; Miller strike home on Reynold's, Muir's defence; And, Alexander, you your cohorts lead, Where Proctor stands, and do the signal deed. â'Tis now! Behold, fast landing from the stream, The heroes form! How dire their bayonets gleam! Silent advance, and firm in purpose keep, And smite in sortie with the falchion deep.â In two divisions without sound they move, Like clouds dark rolling in high heaven above. Todd, Sedwick, Stoddard, Johnson, Ritzer, Ball, Miller make strong, on Reynolds, Muir, to fall; Wood, Metcalf, Bradford,âAlexander join To charge on Proctor and subdue his line. While this was passing, Chambers, on the bank Of the Miami, mark'd the steely rank Of Dudley, forming on the adverse shore To search the venom'd drops of Elliot's gore. He flew to Proctor with a hurried breath, His eyes with terror glaring: âLo, with death, The foe descended!âlanded on the west, A darkening horror plum'd upon their breast!â âThy brain is turn'd! Not possible the foeâ Yes, I behold the ridgy bayonets now!â Proctor rejoin'dâconvulsions on his brow. âThey riseâthey rushâBehold! Chambers, pour onâ Dash rapid o'er the stream and crush them down! They heed not Elliot's thunder! give support With bayonetâ âLo, the breaking from the fort! On all sides death! A bold resistance show! Drench them with fire! Their standards overthrow.â He spoke like courage, but his heart shrunk back; His nerve too trembling for the bold attack, Led on by Alexander dark and still; But Chambers stood, the patriot band to kill. âBritons! shrink notâbut look them in the face! Shame to the soul, that faulters with disgrace! Let flames in volumes, 'gainst their ranks be hurl'dâ And prove your arms victorious to the world.â His words were not concluded, when the roll Of deafening battle, sounded through the whole; The leaden ruins sung along the skies; No curtain wink'd of the Columbian eyes; Though many a random bullet glanc'd a vein, Yet none, save one, fell bleeding on the plain, And that was Bradford. Through his thighs, a ball Tore its rough way, and brought him to a fall; His burning anguish was o'erpower'd by mind: âPush to the mark, and never look behind! Here fix'd will I remain to view the man, Him, who dare wave the colours in the van, And plant them high on yonder parapet; And then, my soul this torture will forget.â Metcalf was pressing hard upon his rear, And heard his voice, which brought him to a tear; He snatch'd a standard waving by his side; Leap'd to the foe, as leaping to his bride. The eagle higher in the air was seen; Proud as she rose, she fann'd the fire within. She rests upon the parapet!âA cheer Informs the Bird of heaven her strength is near! âNow let the sharpening of the steel declare What deaths must come, when Freedom wills to dare!â The time allow'd not Alexander more, Or he would told them how to strike the core; Thick in the thickest of the blaze they dash; Blood, hot with life, is seen at every gash. As arrowy light contends with morning mist, So pierce the steel points through Britannia's breast; The royal strength, with savages combin'd, Scatter like chaff, that whirls upon the wind. Forth Alexander spreads a ruin round; Dismounts the cannon from the breasted mound; Breaks their supporting arms:âin triumph, then Despatches to the fort his captur'd men; But stands himself reserv'd, a stretch'd-out chain, To keep the foe from passing round the plain, Aid t' impart to Reynolds on the rear, With whom, the gallant Miller strives severe. While Proctor thus was conquer'd, Reynolds, Muir, Stood for the conflict in their might secure; Reynolds the squadrons holding on the right; Muir those the left, determin'd in the fight. Ere for the charge, had Miller reach'd the gate, Stoddard approach'd, his name to elevate: âEarnest I plead the opening of the strifeâ T' assail the foe in centre of his life; My soul desires to meet him, steel in hand, Whilst thou, reserv'd, shalt mark my wielding brand.â âBrother in arms! to thy request I yield; Cheerful to thee, I render up the field: I know thy bosom palpitates for fame; Lead to the battleâseek a deathless name.â The instant Miller yielded his consent, Stoddard proclaim'd it to his regiment: âWarriors! 'tis our to strike preparative, And to the foe a palsied stroke to give; Let every bosom for the field enlarge; Portend the spear-pointsâheavy thunder, charge!â As down the mountain cliffs the whirlwind roars, Giving dread notice of tempestuous showers; Such the wild echo of the warriors' tread, Jarring the earth in solid phalanx dread; Against the Albion's left the tempest rolls; A brewing hail-cloud sweeping from the poles. When Muir, with lion watch, the squadrons saw. His strength he strengthen'd to resist the war: âBehold the darkness of the column nigh! Britons! prepare to break it, or to die! Remember Wolfeâand if ye fall like him, Fame from oblivion will your names redeem.â His voice was lost in tumultâby the sound Of clashing armies meeting on the ground; Men mix with menâin desperate strife they join, While bayonets, streak'd with blood, gleam horrid through the line. The Albion centre from the field retire, Where Stoddard's brand shot particles of fire; Muir, mad, beheld the slaughter of his steel, And touch'd his charger with his goading heel, And, at a leap, forth rush'd upon the brave; A moment, each stood frowning like the grave! So when the moon ascends in midnight deep, Climbing through clouds from Alleghany's steep, Half viewless on the blast is seen a ghost, Striking with lightning spear a gloomy host Of angry spectres, prostrate in his wrath, Which fall like dying meteors on his path: But lo, in moon-robes clad, fierce from the north, A hideous form with thunder-brand comes forth, And fronts him in his rage! yet ere they raise To strike and set the elements in blaze. While standing on the edge of adverse cloud, They frown so deep it muffles heaven in shroud! Thus Muir and Stoddard met upon the field, And in suspense the warring armies held. The pausing doneâin circles broad they sweep Their fiery bladesâand clash, and clash, and leap, And rise, and bend, and push, and fence, and thrust, To smite each other backward to the dust; And while the sparkles round their falchions gleam, Their eyes, fast riveted, unwinking beam, And pierce the hidden soul, marking the blow, Ere the quick arm the circumstance can show; Oft in the distance of a hair, they play Just as the other parries it away. At length, their passion to a frenzy rais'd, Dreadful they thrust! The sword of Stoddard graz'd The life of Muirâhis plume, and horsehair white, Are cleft awayâbut, on his helmet bright, The steel is shatter'd with a ringing sound; The glittering point flies sparkling to the ground. Muir's lifted brand descends upon his brow; The high-arch'd brain-wall fractures at the blow; His hands forego the reinsâhe reels, he dies; He yields his spirit to th' indulgent skies. As stands some monument of lofty brow, Above the elemental clouds of snow That float along the sphere, to speak to fame Rescue from tyrants, or some patriot's name; Fix'd on its base, immoveable in form, It laughs defiance at the uproar'd storm; But lo, it totters, by an earthquake riven: Reelsâfalls to dustâits place is lost in heaven! So Stoddard fell in ruins on the plain, Mix'd with his enemies, promiscuous slain. While Stoddard's blood flows forth, Miller displays A thick, black cloud, edg'd round with lightning blaze; Hot, fierce, and dark, the maddening battle comes; Guns thundering, bayonets gleaming, rattling drums; Columbia charges with the edge of steel; Again, the royals from the combat reel. But Reynolds now his solid files pours on, And stays the flying squadrons of the throne. The powers conjoin'd, make earth beneath them jar; Fierce slaughter swells the gory tide of war; In equal balance the contention burns; Each rank progressingânone with faultering turns; Miller, obscur'd with dust, exerts his might, And loud proclaims to hold the desperate fight: âDeep plunge the reeking blade with soul in wrath! Let carnage smile with grimness on our path! Or vict'ry's light shall dwell upon our brow, Or death shall fold us in our blood below!â His squadrons catching flame at every word, Mix steel with steel, and clashing sword with sword. As when a vessel, by the strength of steam, Surmounts the current of Ohio's stream; The glowing furnace gives her engines play, Which, through the water, forces her away. She gains the fallsâand now, to mount them o'er, Requires a stronger exercise of power; The hardy watermen with reeking toil Quicken the furnace with inflaming oil, Which forth with violence excites the blast, As fire infernal to the flames were cast. So Miller's voice augments the strife of arms; With groaning tumult swell the dire alarms; But Reynolds, Muir, stand equal in their fame, And lighten heaven with one unbroken flame. Thus when the Oragon tremendous pours Down the rough mountains, swell'd with torrent showers; From thence rolls onward with impetuous force To drive back Ocean to his mother source; Old Ocean, rising hoary from the main, Piles watery battlements to guard his reign; The waves resistless meet in warring shock; The shores reverberate, and reeling rock; The spongy foam in tortur'd wreaths is driven; The mad-toss'd billows break the clouds of heaven. Columbia charges thus,âthus Albion stand, Whilst War's rough voice roars bellowing round the land. Many and various were the wounds that show'd, From which the purple streams abundant flow'd. The plume of Ritzer from his crown was shot, And the fleet ball the temporal artery cut, From which the warm blood trickled o'er his face, And made him look like Albion's allied race; But soon a bandage skilfully applied, Suppress'd the jetting of the crimson tide; Nothing the foe was favour'd by the wound; His very look spread fearfulness around. Sedwick, while wrenching from a grenadier, With tugging effort hard, his deep-drove spear, Between the sacred Bone next the loins. and vertebral bone, Heard, icy, on his left a dying groan, Which call'd his eye away;âwhom should it be? Todd in the throes of sweating agony! An espontoon was driven through his foot, While near at hand, a British captain mute Held to the far extreme with nerves cramp'd tight, Whom Todd, the moment, had depriv'd of light: Sedwick forth sprungâforsook the grenadier To give him succour in his grief severe. In sitting posture, pressing with each heel Beside the wound, he drew the torturing steel; Todd, by the sudden losing of his pain, Faintedâtwo soldiers bore him from the plain; And Sedwick seiz'd the weapon of the dead, And done such deeds as made his path look red. Johnson, (a name remember'd with delight,) While with his brand was urging on the fight, He found him hurl'd bewilder'd on the ground; In vain he sought discovery of the wound; His brain was jarr'd, and hence amaz'd he stood, Lost to himselfâbut soon, supporting blood, With hurrying motion, hasten'd to relieve The reason-working powerâhis thoughts revive; Instant the cause is obvious to his view; A cannon globe had pierc'd his charger through, Whose entrails large were spread upon the plain, No more to feel the cramping of the rein. Johnson the momentary pause redeem'd; Lock'd with the foe, a fire his falchion seem'd. Vain would it be to number all that bled, Or those who sunk on valour's gory bed; The Muse would faint, and never could there be An end of singing to their memory. Now Muir, half seen, by Miller is descried, Urging the battle in his native pride; The warrior spurs upon him with his steedâ He finds him sweating where the bravest bleed. Each looks defiance at the other's eye; At once in troubled air their falchions fly; The dauntless Briton gather'd in his might, Strikesâto plunge Miller to the shades of night; But, by quick bending, he avoids the blowâ Rising, he wields his brand upon the foe, Which as it circles in a downward sheer Cleaves the depending portion of his earâ Tears the cheek musclesâshatters out his teeth, And splinters wide the bended jaw beneath. Swift from the pulsing artery, that supplies The head with life, the blood with jetting flies; His swimming eyes in heavy darkness roll; From wound unsightly wings his airy soul. In gory dust depends the warrior's headâ Sad accident!âthe stirrup holds the dead! The steed uncurb'dâaffrighted to behold His strong-arm'd rider in his life blood roll'd, Snorts, and flies bounding with the corse behind; Wild as he leaps, it mounts into the wind, Then, in descending, dashes on a rock; The walls of reason shatter by the shock; Wide fly the brains commingled with the blood; The courser dashes frenzied through the wood. Ere long, oblique, the body strikes a tree, Which breaks the thigh and dislocates the knee; The tight-wedg'd foot from out the stirrup flies, O'erwhelm'd on earth the mangled warrior lies, With empty casements where once look'd his eyes. Meanwhile the Patriots, on the rear with Clay, Heard the assault, impatient for the fray; Soon they the order heard: âIn column form! Hark! hear you not the breaking of the storm! How the earth trembles! 'tis the bold sortie Dash'd from the fort to bend the tyrant knee: But wherefore this delay to souls like thine? Rich is your valour as Potosi's mine; Hard gripe your arms with sinews lock'd as death, That when you strike, life wilters on the heath.â They press'd with flinty bosomsâjoin'd the blast, When Muir by Miller on the earth was cast; At the same instant Alexander came, And flank'd the enemy with wasting flame. Assail'd upon the rearâon front and flank, Their souls shrink inward, and their lines disrank; But Reynolds stands unconquer'd in his mightâ His eyes like burning of the sparks of night: âShrink not! Let each sublime his name to heaven! Against th' encircling powers let steel be driven! Standârise superior to the storm of death, And as ye fall, with smiling yield the breath!â The fight was madden'd by his voice;âbut all His efforts are in vainâhis people fall; Blood makes them faintâthey waverâbreak, retireâ Miller pursues them with assailing fire. As column'd smoke is scatter'd by the wind, So fly the enemy, with terror blind; Hard at the borders of the lake they crowd, Wild rout and havock waste away their blood; They loose their barges with a dashing oar, Whilst bolted thunders strike them from the shore. The Patriots shout the victory on high, Back comes the joyful echo from the sky; Then to the fort, flags waving, they repair, While the shrill musick dances on the air. With heart o'erflowing Harrison proceeds: âBrothers!âco-patriots of immortal deeds! On eagle pinions will our memories rise For this day's valour in its victories! Your every footstep on the soil this day, Will make it holy till old Time's decay! Yeaâand a monument, where now we stand, Will speak the daring prowess of the band, Who, for the love of Liberty's sweet breath, Conquer'd their enemies in face of death, And pluck'd the laurel greenââ He paus'd! what damp'd his tongue, Which with sweet musick to the warriors rung? Alas, 'twas Trimble that appall'd his sight, And struck him palsied from his mental height; With blood yet oozing from his wounds he cameâ His tottering step declar'd his feeble frame; His band, unable to sustain their weight, Fainted through weakness ere they reach'd the gate. The scene of wo subdu'd the patriot breast From the proud bearing of their vict'ry bless'd, Thus when Columbians on th' immortal Fourth, Sublime to celebrate their nation's birth, Make the wide welkin echo to the sound Of welcome thunders, breaking from the ground; And after which, with pomp the musick comes Of pipes and hautboys, clarionets and drums; The goblets dance with overflowing wine, Touching the heart with something that's divine; Proud to the zephyr's breath the Stars are given; Balloons, exulting, climb the orb of heaven; A round of pleasures captivates the soul With toasts, and musick, and the flowing bowl. Lo, in the midst of joy the tidings come, That Jefferson has fail'd, and Adams found the tomb! No longer welcome thunders sound to heaven, But mournful lumberings to their tones are given; The fifes, the hautboys, clarionets and drums, Change their shrill notes to something that benumbs. The goblet's brim, that touch'd the spring of mind, Sickens the soulâleaves bitterness behind; Balloons, supported on the mounting air, Drop to the earth, as weighted with despair. The Stars grow darkâsink mourning from the mast Half its descent, and sigh at every blast; In cheeks late dress'd in smiles, deep grief appears; Their joys are dampen'd with a shower of tears. Such was the saddening change when Trimble stood, Gash'd with deep wounds and purpled with his blood. At length, when seatedâand of wine partook, He thus with feebleness the silence broke: âMy soul gives back to speak the fatal dayâ Our brothers slumber in their robes of clay; They sleep the solemn sleepâthe sleep of death, Wrapt in the shrouds of blood upon the heath. âDudleyââ By grief his utterance was suppress'd, Till the pent sigh was vented from his breast: âYeaâDudley rich with life hath found his doom; He asks the charity of a covering tomb. His strength in battle was a whirlwind's breath; Ranks fell before him in the gasp of death; His falchion was a gleam of heaven's fierce light, When fiery clouds are on the brow of night; An angry meteor, burning in its path, Flaming the edges of the clouds in wrath, Was Dudley's brilliant course, then, like a spark Lighting the storm, he dropp'd into the dark!â A solemn stillnessâsomething like despair, Follow'd his voiceâno whisper stirr'd the air; Yet Dudley's valour dull'd the edge of grief, That seem'd too sharp for possible relief; Thus was the passion working on the soul, Compos'd of wonder and despairing dole. At length, the hoary chief the deep pause brokeâ He wip'd his tears and these reflections spoke: âMen are like flowers, that quicken, bud, and bloom, Then languish, fade, and wither in the tomb; Mark, when a rose, begemm'd with virgin dew, Is sever'd from the stem where sweet it grew, A softening pity steals upon the mind To see its beauty scatter'd in the wind: But when the season of its prime is doneâ Never no more to blush upon the sun, We heed it notâfor nature bids it die; We acquiesceânor mourn its memory: âAnd thus it fares with manâwhen green in charms, His life pale withers in Death's icy arms, We mourn his exitâsorrow pours the tear To mark his beauty shrouded on the bier; But when, with age subdu'dâgray, palsied, blind, He weds the dust and yields to heaven his mind, The heart scarce feels itâMan but lives to dieâ When press'd with years, how slight the passing sigh! âHappy the man, who withers in his bloom; The tear of sorrow sanctifies his tomb. So Dudley's grave will be forever blest; A nation's grief will glorify his rest. âBut nothing longer must our sorrows stay The last sad office to his hallow'd clay; All that the living can bestow the dead Is to enfold them in their dusty bed. âJohnson, the barges ply with muffled oar, And pass Miami to the fatal shore, And there the dead inhumeâbut his remains Bear o'er the flood to shrine them on the plains! And, Metcalf, you with your battalion go, And glean the battle-field of friend and foe; Bring Stoddard to the fort, and slaughter'd Muir, Who, though a Briton, yet his soul was pure. A generous foe deserves an honour'd grave, To sleep death's slumber with th' immortal brave.â With hearts, freighted with sorrow, at command, The chiefs proceeded with selected band. They do the solemn rite with reverence pure; Metcalf conveys to fort both Stoddard, Muir. And Johnson bears the lifeless Dudley o'er, While the sad guns by measur'd minutes roar. The shrouded bodies in their graves they lay, As mellow'd heaven withdraws its evening ray; The clods descending on the coffins, sound With hollow rumbling deepâthe mourners round Hear the chill note, and shudder on the ground. Three solemn vollies o'er their tombs they roll, That speak a language awful to the soul; And then, with crowded bosoms, evermore Leave them to moulder on Miami's shore. The anxious traveller, as he journies by, May know the spot where they in darkness lie: Where rests the head of Muir, an oak has rose, Spreading its shadows as it loftier grows; O'er Dudley's tomb, and Stoddard's mouldering grave, Two infant cedars in the light breeze wave: Eternal roots support their heads serene, Rob'd in the beauty of unchanging green. CANTO XVI. SANDUSKY. ARGUMENT. Disaffection of the Indians .... The descent of Fredonia .... Investment of Fort Sandusky .... The Flag of Truce .... The Bombardment .... Proctor defeated. The scene is laid at Malden, in Heaven, on the White Mountains, and at Sandusky .... The time is three days. Meantime the wild-men driven from the shore, For Malden hurried with impetuous oar; Landedâthey show'd a strangeness in their cast, Like those condemn'd to perish in the blast For gibbet crimes. In vain they strove to rest, For dreams of dying lurk'd within their breast. They shrunk with panick thoughts:âyea, even yet Their fancy sees upon the parapet The gallant Metcalf wave the standard forth, And hears the shout that bounded from the earth, As band of Alexander rush'd along With death's deep promise breaking from their tongue; They think at times, that Miller's sword is seen, Like fire of heaven, that smites the souls of men. At length, new day appearing in the skies, The race of blood in dire confusion rise; A sourness gathers in Tekelah's eye, That his young warriors found mortality. Cawataw's cannibals reveal their ire, By reason that Tecumseh sav'd from fire Their victims, captur'd on the Dudley shore, Where their grim chief was slaughter'd in his gore. They beat their bosoms with bewilder'd airâ And, mad with fury, fix upon their hair, And rend it, bleedingâdizzy in their brains, With dismal howl they start th' affrighted plains. So gaunted wolves with raven maws surround A snowy flock to seize them at a bound; But, cautious, wait the fading of the dayâ In mind already fasten'd on their prey;â Behold the village swains their path beset, And make with gushing blood the pasture wet; Some breathe no more, but others wing their speed; A look subdues their lifeâthey stop, they bleed. At length, with panting, they descend their cave, Where soon with hunger they begin to rave; Each maddening each to desperation's height, By each accusing other of the flight, Pealing, in concert dire, a deafening yell, Loud as the scream of agony in hell. Like this, the allies of the Albion king, With frightful howlings make the welkin ring. Tekelah, lowering with a settled gloom, Points with his bloody battle-axe for home; Silent his clan take notice of the sign, And press behind him in a deepening line. Tecumseh saw the disaffected host, And swift pursu'd it ere the whole were lost; A keen vexation eating on his heart, To think the chiefs should darken and depart. He seem'd to wing his wayâon air to swim, Such inward spirit quicken'd every limb. Thus when a carriage on descending plains, The post resigning to the steeds the reins, Flies with hot motionâdarting by the wind, Leaving a cloud of up-whirl'd dust behind; Each wheel so rapid on its axle turns, That earth beneath it with the friction burns; The whirling spokes, deceptious mock the eye, Lost in the circle of rapidity. Such was the progress of Tecumseh's speed, As half enrag'd he bounded o'er the mead; And like the wheel-spokes were his flying feet Mix'd in the sight, their motion was so fleet. Soon he Tekelah in his path o'ertakes, And brief the purpose of his coming breaks: âBrother, why home, and rest the tomahawk? Bid stand your warriorsâhold we here a talk.â Tekelah at the summons wav'd his handâ Sullen in place, his train like murder stand. He paus'd,âand thus: âTecumseh, we despise Proctorâhe fly before his enemies; Large did he promise plunder in the fray; But noise of battle make his heart give way.â Tecumseh then: âToo near of truth you talk; Proctor pale bloodâhe crooked in his walk; But hatchet bury notâkeep mad the wars; The Spirit Great will give to us the cause. âOur fathers' ghosts behold us in their joyâ Yes, soon shall we our enemies destroy; On airy cloud in heaven, in loose robes white, I saw them smile for my success in fight; Cawataw's shade in prime of youth was seen, And other chiefs in years of beauty green! âAdmit that we in strife of arms should die, Would we not mount like eagles in the sky To sport with nimble feet upon the lawn, Or chase the elk, or tame the speckled fawn? There, game of every wing in flocks appear, And buffaloes, and flying-footed deer; There, when we list, the silver streams we'll swim, And drink till gladness lightens every limb; Should death the brave man startle with affright, When such rare scenes are ready for delight? âHave you not often eagerly pursu'd The flying chase through many a boundless wood. Till your joints trembled with excess of toil, About to sink and breathe upon the soil; But in the act of yielding up the cast, A lucky arrow took the game at last: âSo now, perhaps, our greatest toils are doneâ To-morrow glories in a brighter sun. âThink not of homeârejoin the fight with powerâ We'll drive them yet beyond Ohio's shore; Me give you large wide hunting ground and goodâ From the Miami to the Wabash flood; Prophet, from thence to Mississippi west; To other chiefs me portion out the rest.â Tekelah thus,âwhen broken was his pause: âWise be your tongueâme join you in the cause.â No more of words between the chiefs was saidâ Tekelah drew his tomahawkâa dread Deep muster'd in his eye as forth it came, Which storm'd his countenance and shook his frame: He whirl'd it round and pointed to the path; Instant his clan express'd their former wrath, Pealing the war-song with discordant yell, Like furies loosen'd from the bonds of hell. To Malden back they hie with gestures dire, At every step their madness kindling higher. And now, his charger Proctor mounts in style; His army squar'd and solid every file. His left the bit commandsâhis dexter hand Sustains with regal port his polish'd brand; Its burnish'd point above his shoulder gleams; And, in appearance, brave as Wolf he seems; His words come boasting with a pompous sound To royal legionsâsavages around: âWhat though the Fort hath not surrender'd ours, Few suns shall pass before we gain its powers; Our courage yet is whole. I've form'd a plan By which we'll subjugate their every man. Ere this, should we have scatter'd them in rout, Had it not been for that deceiving scout, Which stay'd our bulwark labours in the night, And made us vain the empty darkness fight; But understanding what is their deceit, Never again can they their arts repeat. âThough our endeavours at the fort were vain, Has not Tecumseh strew'd with death the plain? An army triple of his own destroy'd, Which, with the foe has made a dreadful void! Let none look grave with a desponding eye, We yet shall strike, and strike with victory! âWe'll now retire. But when bright day shall come, And we awaken'd with the stirring drum, In ready barges rapid we'll repair To Fort Sandusky, to assail them there. A spy, who hurried to the camp at light, Informs, a boy but stands against our might, With others green in years!âThese, when they spy The Crossâfor mercy, on their knees will cry; But spare notâlift the hatchetâslay the broodâ Take ample vengeance for the red man's blood! âNow when Sandusky to our will is bent, Then, by our strength and skilful management, Soon we'll compel Miami to resign, And on th' Ohio post our southern line; Yea, from the lakes to that dividing flood, The foe surrenders, or he swims in blood!â Each eye approving smil'd to hear the plan; The hope of conquest shone from rear to van; In which delusive light they lose the pain Their late disaster on Miami's plain; Nor heed the darkness which at distance lowers, Again to overshade with death their powers. So when deep clouds a village overcast, Borne in thick squadrons on the winged blast; Thunders explode with hail and forky fires, While the red tempest in its rage aspires; The trembling villagers stand shock'd with dread, To mark the horrors bursting o'er their head. At length, disparting on the wings of heaven, The clouds fly diverseâthrough the concave driven; The swains rejoice to view the welcome sun; All their past terror with the tempest gone, Not heeding of a spot that stains the north, Soon to enlarge and hurl new terrors forth. Not otherwise their minds forget the past; None dream the gathering of a second blast, At distance brewing, heavy to descend In showers of death their brittle life to rend. To Proctor now Tecumseh broke his mind, What he had secret to himself design'd: âI well approve of the Sandusky fight; But we with art must compass them aright. What talk you how the enemy deceiveâ How by his scouts he make you false believe? In Indian too, deceitâat Tip'canoe, Their chief thought not but Prophet meant him true; But we deceive, to strike upon him dead Ere he should break the slumber of his bed. âNow listen to Tecumseh: Meigs surroundâ With me, Tekelah circle on the ground; While you Sandusky fight, this nest we bar, And thus divided carry on the war. Me form sham battle, as their friends had come Laden'd with things of luxury from home; They hear my riflesâissue from the fort, And then Tecumseh show them day-light sport.â Him, Proctor smiling, thus: âBrother, you've stood The first in council, and the field subdu'd; But this your plan of warfare is the best, That e'er your judgment hath made manifest. But should your battles be in vain, why then, When Croghan yields, with royal-hearted men I'll storm the fortressâoverleap the wallâ The Eagle fluttering, in the dust shall fall. âDixon, to you Cawataw's tribe I give, That in your presence not a youth may live. But, Reynolds, you in readiness will stand, Till I secure possession of the land, Then, with reserve, the lake you'll compass o'er, And plant a conquering standard on the shore. âNow to pavilions, royalists! repair, And rest the mind, made weary with its care, And feast the body on luxurious fare; But when at day, the reveillÃ© shall beat, Rise, and make dark the waters with the fleet. âBut who comes straining from the east?ââ He scarce had said, When who should reach the field, but Vincent's aid; Of triumph breath'd his voice: âProctor, behold, The pride of Freedom in the dust is roll'd! At Queenstown Heights, our fame hath reach'd its heavenâ Before our steel, invasion back is driven! And, as by York, I dash'd along the path, Sheffie stood frowning in a cloud of wrath, Ready the landing of the foe to strike, Led in their daring by the sword of Pike!â A shout, like thunder rolling, broke to heaven, Thrice to the earth, the echo back was driven. Proctor exclaim'd: âThe States, the whole are ours! They wilt before us like the noon-mow'd flowers! The English oak will shade them from the sunâ Their summer's past, their winter has begun!â They shouted thrice againâand fil'd away To be prepar'd against the coming day. Meanwhile the empyreal glories of the skies Beheld the war with their immortal eyes: High on the diamond wall, sublime they stood, Their clear orbs rolling in a lucid flood Of amber lightâBut now, with grace divine, Imbower'd with fragrance, in the grove they shine; On golden seats, reclin'd in crescent rings,â Their bright forms shaded with their rainbow wings; Love pours its holy transport from each eye, And every passion of sweet ecstacy. Justice arose, unalter'd in his look, And with a dignity of utterance spoke: â'Tis now decreed, Fredonia, heavenly Maid, That thou descend and give thy offspring aid; Deep have they suffer'd for disunion, nowâ Hence hope gives promise never more they'll bow To hell's grim agencyâbut wisdom learn By past affliction and to faith return; They now for trial probatory stand, To be united, or a broken band; Hence, not as yet 'tis given thee to consume The host infernal, till I speak their doom.â He spoke the consult, and resum'd his seat, And Independence rose with soul elate: âJoys of divinity my breast inspire, Touching my heart with a celestial fire, That young Columbians on the battle day, Th' immortal daring of their sires display; Hence, with the foe I'd nothing interfere, But yield to them the fiery fields severe; Yet with strict guard observe the powers of night, They aid not Albion to maintain the fight; But let the freeborn build their own renown By native effort, striking back the crown: As late, Fredonia on Niagara's tide Touch'd with her spear the Fiendâsubdu'd his pride, Then, let the war take courseâso, even now, Her care should be to foil the gloomy foe;â But if that Heaven with battles interfere, Where would the valour of our sons appear? Lo, with one effort we could sweep away The race of man, reducible to clay; Let mortal single against mortal stand, That each may prove the virtue of his land.â Ere he had ended, every heart was won, The war should be conducted as begun, Save but to curb the future strides of him, Who burst from hell, in Freedom's blood to swim; But nothing farther, till the States in one Should weld their strength to break the chaining Throne; Then they decree, Fredonia from the earth Should strike him backward to his place of birth. The Goddess now, and the celestials, rise To leave, for earth, immortal paradise; She gains the battlements of heaven divine, Where all the synod in due order shine; Infantile Spirits hover round the Fair With golden harps to strike the sacred air. Loose round her temples, whiter than the snow That sleeps unsullied on the mountain's brow, A garland twinesâcompos'd of myrtle rareâ The rose, the lily, and the jessamine fair: These bloom luxuriant, of exquisite dye, That wakens beauty in an angel's eye. Her hair as touch'd with Love's soft fingers curls, And o'er her neck like melted amber furls, Flowing exuberant, wonderous to behold, Like burnish'd threads of pure effulgent gold. Light o'er her polish'd limbs, a robe is cast, Which, in its texture, nature's works surpass'd, Wrought by the butterflies, that spin in heaven, Where life abundant at its source is given: Not like those worms, that labour on the earth, Dying the moment they receive their birthâ But when the winding of their silk is done, They shine like rainbows glittering in the sun; And, like the things of heaven, their forms improve, Sporting eternal in the beams of love. The souls, that never touch the earth, receive These beauteous webs, and, with light fingers, weave The robes of seraphim,âin which appear The mimick stars, that decorate the sphere. Such was the wond'rous robe Fredonia wore To take her flight from the empyreal shore; Three radiant zones its waving folds unite Round her fair waist, of matchless colours brightâ The red,âthe spotless white,âunfading blue, Shining forever with a brilliance new. Her wings partake the fashion of a dove, Half spread, to leave the battlements above; The plumes were dipp'd within a rainbow dye, Then fluid gold was sprinkled carelessly. Her alabaster arm sustains a shield, Gold, pure with finingâon which reveal'd, Are Heights of Bunker blazing as with fire, And Trenton kissing heaven with many a spireâ Eutaw, and Monmouth, and the plains of York And Saratoga, glitter in the work. Beneath these emblems, on the gold is seen, Inscrib'd by angel hand and diamond pen, The Declaration, which proclaim'd afar The light that kindled from the Freedom Star. So bright the splendour of the wond'rous shield, The dazzling suns look dim upon the field! This on her left: Her dexter holds a spear, Temper'd with light in heaven's sublimest sphere; Its vital point turns dark the brightest starâ Full in the blaze of heaven its brilliance shines afar. Lo, now, Fredonia spreads her angel wings! Loud with hosannas the empyreal rings! The infant spirits touch the quivering wire, And join symphonious to the ravish choir; Hymming proud Liberty in choral songâ Her praises shouting with their flaming tongueâ The rights of man, that sanctifies the cause Of th' elective franchiseâFredom's equal laws, Swelling the theme sublime with musick high, As sails the Goddess on her embassy. Down the pure element she cleaves her way, While round her burn the quenchless beams of day; Heaven stands in holy gazing at her flight, Through shining circles of effulgent light. From star to starâmid blazing orbs divine, Of which no mortal ever saw their shine, So distant plac'd near Deity's abode, That not to earth their radiance yet hath flow'd, Though since creation's birth they've shot their beams, Swift as the madded lightning when it gleams! At each exertive motion of her wing She darts her way, the distance of the ring That circles Saturnânext outstrips the first, Trifold, immenseâto reach the globe of dust; The next succeeding, distances the last, Measuring a system of creation vast; The swiftest sparkle of far-shooting light Creeps in its course to her immortal flight; The vital mind upon the wing of fire, Which at a thought attains its high desire, Scarcely excels her wonderful descent, Through the vast regions of the element. At length she gains the system of the sun, And thinks her journey to the earth is done; She meets the comets in their distant round, Like blazing oceans through the void profound; At once she strikes her wing to Herschell's sphere; And then to Saturnâthen to Jupiter. A gliding motion from these sun-lit stars Finds her descended to the angry Mars; But quick she turns from his inflaming eye, And gains the Sun, self-balanc'd in the sky. Her presence adds new brightness to his rays, And wide through heaven illuminates his blaze; The spots that marr'd the beauty of his face Shine with the splendour of primeval grace. With eye sublim'd she views the golden chains, Which hold the planets in their circling plains. And silver moons that round about them play, Reflecting back the image of his ray:â Lost for a moment, wrapt in wonderment, Though heaven the purest was her element, She marks their order as through space they roll. Marshall'd in beauty by the sun's control. Long had she gaz'd, but lo, the passing Earth Caught her tranc'd eye, and call'd her purpose forth,â The Sun, to favour her divine descent, Calls a rich cloud from Mercury's firmament, And gives it all the beauty of his light, In which the rainbows kissingly unite. The Goddess takes the present with a smile, Folding her wings upon her breast the while; And now, superior seated on her car, Smooth she descends to visit earth afar. Evening's soft light was melting on the breast Of mist-bath'd mountains when she gain'd the west; Around Columbia on the cloud she sailsâ Not by the buoyancy of breathing gales, But by the will that in herself abides; Like a new beauty through the heavens she glides, Calling the gaze of wondering mortals forth, Like when bright angels visited the earth. Lo, at the glance of her immortal eyes, The land, the ocean, like enchantment rise. Broad round the ocean she extends her view To mark the navy, Albion to subdue; To bring the sea-bred Lion to his knee, And make him feel the power of Liberty. Rodgers appears with all his sail-wings bent Sublim'd with valour in the President; Hull, Jones, Decatur, Warrington, are seen; Burroughs, renown'd with honourable men; Percival, with laughing art upon his mein; Allen, and Biddle, Stewart, mild yet brave; And Barry, Bainbridge, fearless on the wave. Next, o'er the landscape she extends her eyes, And the progression of the war descries. At Plattsburg, Macomb like a fortress stands To foil invasion with his chosen bands; The young Macdonough, glowing in his pride, Launching his battle-ships in silver tide; And Perry, at the Rock, his fleet in trim, Ready at signal on the lake to swim. In Chauncy's navy, warriors led by Pike, York, their proud capital at day to strike; And Meigs, and Malden. After which appears Sandusky, guarded by the young in years. Johnson is seen upon Kentucky's plain, Gathering her sons to curb th' oppressor's reign; Combin'd with Shelby to invade the shore, And humble Proctor and the savage power. These she beheld, as evening's mellow beam Withdrew from earth like a celestial dream; She leaves her car in heaven, and lights serene, With hallow'd feet, on Vernon's Mountain green; Her vital touch gives quickening to the tomb; Flowers, worthy heaven, spring forth in primal bloom, The pale, green willows, that around it mourn, Weep their soft tears of sorrow on the urn, While thirteen rainbows circle o'er their head, Form'd by the incense of the mighty dead, Wrapp'd in the dark of death;âeach radiant bow. Bears a bright star of beauty on its brow, Round which, delicious on the breath of even, Ãolian numbers sound by deities of heaven. At length, the solemn darkness melts awayâ Faint, one by one, the jewel stars decay; Yet Venus glows more bright, as they decline, And rob'd in loveliness, delights to shine; Her beauteous eye like love in rapture beams, And trembling sparkles in the dark blue streams. The sweet enchantments delicately fade; The car of clouds descends, and bears the Maid Smooth from the earthâtoo gross the mortal eye To view the scenes of immortality. The flowers that quicken'd to celestial bloom, Sunk in the bosom of the darksome tomb; The star-crown'd rainbows melted into air, And left it lonely with the willows there. Through Albion's camp, the drums proclaim'd the dayâ They startâawakenâand to boats away; Tekelah joins Tecumseh with his powerâ They launch, for Meigs, their barges from the shore; Short, Chambers, ProctorâDixon with his horde, And Gordon, bearing a commanding sword; And Prophet, brother of Tecumsehâglide Swift o'er the lake, Sandusky to decide. Its stream they enter'd, as the sun at noon Stood at his restâthe little fortress soon Open'd before them with its Eagle high, Searching the beam of heaven unwinkingly. They land, they spread innumerous on the shore, Like summer insects, when in swarms they pour. The meantime Croghan ever in his thought Had held the precepts that the veteran taught, To keep his mind upon the royals bent, And then the fort they'd never circumvent. Soon as he mark'd the gathering of the foe, It caus'd a richness through his heart to flow; A martial kindling in his bosom came, And touch'd each word as with a seraph's flame: âBehold invasion darkening on the sight! Say, feel ye not no thrilling of delight? My young companions, harness'd new in arms, Does not the prospect to your souls bring charms? YesâI behold a language in your eye, That proves what inward is your ecstacy! âLet each with holy breath invoke his fair, To nerve his arm for something that is rare; By them inspir'd, our enemies must die, And clothe our names with immortality! âWhat though like swarming they invade the ground, And hem our walls with multitudes around, Raise but the soul to admiration high,â Let thousands come, we stand for Liberty!â Warm, like the kindling of a meteor spark, Breaking the solidness of midnight dark, The flame of Croghan enter'd to the soul, And forth they answer'd: âThunders, let them rollâ Yea, let the foe spout cataracts of fire And flood the fortâwith life we'll ne'er retire!â What time this pass'd, the legions of the Crown Impatient gaz'd to see the Eagle down. Dixon's grim host stood sharpening up their knives, Ready to scalp and massacre their lives. Saliva druling from their jaws was seen, While hunger gnaw'd upon their stomachs keen, To eat the heart of Croghanâtear his flesh, And drink his warm blood at the fountain fresh. Proctor at length, with vehemence of look, To Chambers, Elliot, his impatience spoke: âWhat, dare they think resistance to our will! Forth shall the savage have command to kill! Chambers and Elliot, warn him of his fate; At setting sun to yield will be too late! Worse than at Raisin will I be his death; By small degrees, I'll fry away his breath!â They in their silence, his instructions heard; Fix'd is the flag of peace on Chambers' sword; With martial steppings to the fort they hied, With all the pomp that royalty supplied. Proctor breath'd poison in the Prophet's ear; He bade him sly to hover on their rear, And seize upon the warrior sent from fort, And break the truce, and then begin the sport. Croghan with strict observance soon beheld The truce approach. To Ship the hero wheel'd, Who scarce had summers seen twice five and seven, But all his youth was to his country given: âBrother in arms! behold, their flag arrives; Go, meet it on the field:âthey seek our lives; Let thy bold answer enter to the soul; When all are slain the fort's at their control.â Ship, without answer, touch'd with beauty's glow, Advanc'd to meet the parley of the foe. The perfect symmetry of every limb, Seem'd to impart a buoyancy to swim; Quick round his eye an infant lightning ran, Which show'd the promise of the future man. Chambers, important, met the blushing boy, And labour'd thus his virtue to decoy: âKnowing the rashness of unguarded youth, Proctor, our general, noted for his truth, Hath sent this flag to warn you of your fate, Ere that his arms your lives annihilate! âLook round! behold the royal standards dread! Observe the savages to strike you dead! Mark, how they brandish in the air their knives! Goâand with prayers, surrender up your lives!â Ship paus'dâhis breast was full: âHe knows our youthâ We also know this mighty man of truth, And render him our thanks, to grant us word, That we with prayer surrender up our sword: But please you whisper in his gracious ear, No prayers from us, repentant will he hear; We pray to none, save Him who dwells on highâ The Centre Point of immortality; Yon Eagle from her height will ne'er retire, Till her defenders in their blood expire!â He spoke with searching eye, and wheel'd to march: âTarry, fair youth,ââthus serpent Elliot arch: âNever my tongue a flattering speech declar'dâ 'Tis poison to my soulâwith hell compar'd;â But, to behold thee in thy peerless bloom, Devoted to endure a savage doom, Gives to my heart a sympathy of grief, Beyond my power to offer you relief; That rose upon thy cheek will pale like snow; The blood in thy young heart will cease to flow; That eye, that swims in firmamental blue, Irons, tipt with fire, will lingering pierce it through; These locks, that thy fair lineaments adorn, Will from thy skull by gory hands be torn. âCome to my bosomâshelter you with me, And I to you a guardianship will be; Comeâbe ennobled with Britannia's power! And royal honoursâwealthââ âPoison no more! No more I'll hear the serpent of thy tongueâ Suppress the noteâa croaking raven song! âCome to thy bosom! bosom, that retains The crimes, the blackest of infernal stains! Come to thy bosom! royal honours!âWhat? A bosom nursing vipersâhell begot! âNever you flatter'd with an oily word! And is it poison, to your soul abhorr'd? Think then, I urge thee, where wilt thou be cast, When Death shall call thee to expire thy last? Does not thy soul with frightful murder start, When thou call'st back the memory of Hart? Does not his spirit trouble thee at night, And walking dead men terrify thy sight? âAnd canst thou hear without a blush his name? It proves thy baseness link'd to damning fame! âGood heaven! suppress the rising of my soul; My crowded heart is breaking from control! His martyr'd blood will nerve our arms with power! Advance to yonder mound, and death shall thee devour!â Like muster'd thunders, when they wrathful break, Causing the battlements of heaven to shake, Link'd round with chains of fire; such was the peal From Freedom's youth, which made the Britons feel; Such was the flash that lighten'd from his eye, Which burnt upon their hearts like agony. Ship purpos'd to returnâbut Prophet sly, Crouch'd from his hiding,âas his sword swung by Caught at the scabbard!âShip, without a word, Turn'd short, and as he wheel'd he bar'd his sword. The savage drew his axe!âburning they stood With weapons in the act to taste of blood! But as they The weapons. felt the impulse of the hand To smite the other bleeding on the sand, Chambers beheld, and rush'd himself between, And check'd the Indian with reproving mein. Thus Gabriel, Satan, on the walls of Eden, Stood fix'd in wrathâtheir dreadful powers even; Satan dilated, horrid for the fight, And Gabriel strengthen'd with eternal might; But lo, in heaven, the parting scales were seen: Satan retir'dâa cloud upon his mein. Ship smother'd up his blade, and wheeling short, With steps of honour, enter'd in the fort, And stated the resultâshow'd Elliot's art At first to frighten, then subdue his heart. Blank'd stood the heralds with confusion's eye To be defeated in their embassy; Their conscience struggled to suppress the truth; Their deep designs outmaster'd by a youth. Back to the camp of Proctor they recede, And state in whispers what the boy had said. âDare they resistance?âsend me such report? Quick let the brass dash ruin on the fort! Deep charge the mortarsâset fire to the air With hissing bombs, to desolate them there. Soon mercy will they plead with prayerful cryâ But prayers I answer with mortality! Yeaâwill I make my threatening promise good; I'll make a warm bath of their smoking blood! âAway, and burn the element with flame; An hour hence, not one shall have a name!â The mortars burst with fireâthe shells reboundâ The heavy guns in unison resound. But Croghan stands unchang'dâoutlooks the blast, Which rolls above him the sublime and vast. Thus, when a youth, on Avon, Shakspeare stood To gaze at nature in her wildest mood, For now the clouds were mustering in the north To pour a deluge in tornado forth; Their broken savageness attract his sight, Rolling in darkness, mixing day with night; Dread through the firmament, glance lightning firesâ New thunders peal, ere half the flash expiresâ The poet's mind takes wing upon the storm, And riots awful in the dark deform. So Croghan stands and glories in the scene, His young companions firm in discipline. At length the veil of night the foe conceals, And Proctor to his chiefs his pain reveals: âAnd do they foil us?ânever will they yield? What, without answer, do they dare the field? Verily they standâdefy our best! They heed us notâbut seem with slumber press'd; Nothing of brass upon our lines they turn; Noânor a sparkle has been seen to burn. In different manner we'll our strength exert; We'll bulwarks raise to batter down the fort. Chambers, the guns upon the river flame, While Short and Gordon will the batteries frame; That when the day shall open in the cast, We'll break their walls, and let the savage feast.â Chambers and Elliot to the boats repair, And hurl the bombs like wild things through the air; Th' intrenchers follow the command of Short And Gordon, to sweep desolate the fort. The labour smokes by fresh unwearied men, The spaders rear where mattockers had been; Through embrasures the cannon frowns severe, Early at day to shake the hemisphere. Meanwhile round Croghan stood his little group Of officers, determin'd ne'er to stoop A joint to kneeling, save to smiting death, While they should draw the breathing of a breath. Meaks, Hunter, Johnson, Butler, Anthony, Met to consultâtheir warriors outwardly Stood in a circle to attend their word, When they in plans defensive should accord. Hunter to Croghan: âShall we touch the fire, And cause these fighting-barges to retire? See, they more daring in their progress grow; Small by degrees upon the fort they row. Our globes would strike and shiver many a boat, And cause its ruins with the stream to float.â The youth his judgment show'd: âThy words are just, That we full many in the stream could thrust; But oft it happens, for temporary gain, We lose the cause our efforts would attain. Now, should we open on their barge with fire, We soon indeed would force them to retire; But mark, their bombs in wandering circles fly; They break beyond usâscattering through the sky; Now, should we them more distantly remove, They might more dangerous to our safety prove. âBesides, if we no opposition show, In time 'twill make more venturesome the foe, And foil him from his guard,âthe moment then, We'll let him know how soon that boys are men, âJohnson, your files will occupy the north; Hunter, the south,âto meet their coming forth; Butler and Anthony, the east and west; Meaks, hold the brass. Through night, by parts we'll rest; The cannon's voice will rouse us with alarms, Should they in darkness make th' attempt by arms.â Martial, yet modest, he proclaim'd the word, And each fulfill'd itâlock'd in one accord; The sentries watch with jealousy of soul, While o'er their heads the meteorous bombshells roll. At length, the waning Moon with silver horn Shines on her hill,âprecurser of the dawn; Venus, her daughter, slow behind her moves With bashful footsteps o'er the mountain groves; As nature beautiful, as heaven divine, Like holy things, with loveliness they shine; They catch the soul's devotion as they rise, While just below, gray twilight streaks the skies. As darkness vanisheth, the works are seen, At which the Albions had at labour been. Croghan breaks forth: âBehold, they've chang'd their site! The river is at peaceâon land they fight! How violent they dash the fire severe! And let them dash itânone regards it here! Void of effect they magnify the flameâ Soon they'll exhaust, like madness when it's tame. âSee how the balls that strike us on the north, Lie in their slumber, bedded in the earth! The strife, as yet, our efforts would debase; But 'twould the nation's character disgrace, Without a gun to let them home return; If nothing more, salute from us shall burn. âThe Stars, with brilliance in their orbits, shine Full in the breeze, like something that's divine; The Eagle points her arrowsâflaps her wing, To hear the thunder-voice of Britain ring. I feel strange rapture stirring in my breast, That never yet by language was express'd; Stand pillar'd to the earth! The coming even, My mind forebodes we'll send their souls to heaven! Be nothing dauntedâtake substantial life To give your valour energy in strife; Man cannot live upon the mindâbut food Must give his body nourishment of blood.â He touch'd their youthful hearts, like touch of fire, Which gave their souls a newness of desire; Unmov'd, they seated and their hunger stay'd, And every purpose of his will obey'd, While bent on death the Albions cannonade. Proctor discover'd his exertions vain; And while a madness swell'd upon his brain, His tongue broke forth: âWill thunder not removeâ Nothing reduce yon Eagle from above? âAt angle of the north the cannon bend; There breach the fort, and cause it to descend. No more the time with useless toil consume, But plunge with steel and strike them to the tomb.â He said. And presently his will was doneâ True at the angle bent was every gun; As hail, descending from a spring-time cloud, Beats on the earth to kill its tender bud, So thick the globes from royal engines burst To breach the fort and level it to dust,â And smite the youths that hold it in their trust. Croghan soon scann'd the motive of the foeâ To breach and enter to his overthrow: âWarriors! behold their purposes are plain! Strengthen the angleâmake their efforts vain! Johnson, Anthony, with rapid hand, Defy a breach with canisters of sand. Shipp, Hunter, Dunkin, the full store bring forth, And form a double fencement on the north; They now design with steel our hearts to pierceâ Their former warfare total to reverse. And let them come, like waves of tempest sea, We'll meet them here, and meet them smilingly! âIn northern bastion, Meaks, the cannon place, And keep it darken'd from the royal race; Six practis'd warriors to assist thee take, And cautious level, through the trench to rake. Crowd but half weight of death-dust in its womb, To spread in its explosion, general doom; But to the full, load canister and ball, That when it opens, ranks on ranks may fall.â Presently the whole commence the toilâ And soon th' intentions of the foe they foil, Meaks crowds the brass as Croghan gave in charge, With grape and canister, both small and large, Then scatters leaves, as thoughtless, yet with care, That none might notice what of death was there. Now they at signal to their places hie To watch the movements of the enemy. Thus, when a fowler, having set his snare To trap a flock of wild doves in the air, Retires in silence to his secret blind, To ken their motions as they ride the wind; And restless counts the time to see them come To spring the net that folds them in their doom: With like impatience the young heroes wait To mark the foe to rush upon his fate. While thus the fortedâProctor with his glass Observ'd a breach effected by his brass, For lo, a blemish on his pupil gray, Threw a beam broken on the retina, Which, in the brain, produc'd a motion there, As though the angle had been swept in air; Glad at his heartâstepping with lofty port, Proud he began to Dixon and to Short: âThe fort is ours! They soon shall be in tearsâ The whole in ruins to my sight appears! âShort, through the breach with thy battalions on! Regard you not the bursting of a gun; Had they exploding brass, the globes to throw, Its jaws would stream the battle-fire ere now; Heed not the flashing of the rifles smallâ Strikeâere the sparkle scorches to the ball. âRound to the south, thy wild-men, Dixon, wheel, And, Gordon, thy command. With bayonet steel, Silent advance, till opposite the rear, Then raise the death-yell to excite their fear; This will allure them from the breach away, Till Short shall enter and decide the day.â His officers comply with hellish zeal, And all the savageness of Proctor feel; Dixon, with scarce an attribute of man, Proceeds, contriving blood, to head his clan. The eye of Short burnt with the rage of sin, Which show'd the workings of his heart within; He join'd his squadrons with a dÃ¦mon's tread, Unsparing murder brewing in his head. Meantime the monarch of the realms of night, From Valparaiso, and from Queenstown Height, Return'd to Hampshire's mountain, press'd with care, Caus'd by the troubles which beset him there. Beneath a ledge of hanging rocks he sits, Showing his feeling by his brow that knits. His subjects rise to pay him homage dueâ While in this attitude, an Agent flew And stood before the throne! A moment past, He walk'd with Proctor, as the engines cast The globes against the angle of the fort; He comes in hasteâthe tidings to report: âDread monarch!âProctor, thy half mortal son, At fort of Meigs was partially undone; In spite of all my art, a mad sortie Drove him disaster'd o'er the inland sea; But lo, Tecumseh with his banded power, Subdu'd an army on the adverse shore. âNow at Sandusky are a chosen host; Royals and savagesâBritannia's boast, Striving the angle of the fort to breach, That they with steel may its defenders reach; A beardless boy commands, hence nothing doubt, But Proctor soon will raise triumphant shout.â The Fiend was silent with unalter'd eye, Pausing his wordsâAt length, he deign'd reply: âTriumphant shout!âNoânever will it be, So fix'd they stand in battle desperately; Hadst thou the action seen, which late they fought, Not thou, nor hell, would call their valour naught; Though Britain seems to weigh their courage light, Her ships had sunk, had We withheld Our might; The Essex, made half ship-wreck by a blast, Had conquer'd two of a superior cast. âYesâand of late upon the Queenstown Height, They'd won the fieldâbut Discord plann'd arightâ Fredonia thereâ âBut why with words delay? The time admits not of a moment's stay; 'Twould like a palsy all Our hopes destroy, Should Proctor now be routed by a boy. âRevenge, awayâth' infernal caldron fire, Fashion a cloud and in its folds retire, And with it wrap the fort,âand blind their sight, That Proctor may advance and gain the fight! âBut stayâno agency will now suffice; Too, too momentous is the enterprise; Ourself will goâbut you, the cloud may form, Equal in darkness to a midnight storm.â The agent heardâand, waiting no reply, To its fulfilment parted instantly. Beneath a jutting ledge the caldron stands, Fashion'd in rudeness by infernal hands, Far in the west of hellâfrom thence brought forth, When with his train the DÃ¦mon rose to earth. Compos'd its substance is, of fire-proof stoneâ Ten furies bore it up with many a groan, Causing their iron joints to sweat and ache, Fill'd to its brim with burnings of the lake. Revenge approach'dâsurcharg'd with hellish ire, And gnash'd his teethâfrom which the seeds of fire Leap'd to the lava with attractive power, Like the quick lightning to the midnight shower, Or like the dust, that kindles mortal strife, Draws from the flint to strike it into life. The lava feels the particles of fireâ A thousand flashes at the touch aspire, Black as the flames that feed upon a ghost, Suffering for hell-crimes,âonce his secret boast: And such the virtue of the lighted mass, It burns for ages, ever what it was! A cloud of solid darkness passes forth, And veils in horror the black mountain north; For murder'd blood, the druling panthers prowlâ At passing shadows pale the wild wolves howl; As mad the lava boiling tosses high, Nests of live lightnings from the cauldron fly, Which, winding upward, leap along the cloud, Whilst muttering thunders groan, and earthquakes rumble loud. Now as th' Infernal by the caldron stands, A lightning flame he seizes in his hands; Slow he descends upon the coffin blast, Griping the serpent fire with sinew fast! As round his form terrifical it plays, His gore-stain'd locks are kindled to a blaze. So when a meteor shooting in a line, Touches a hill, o'erspread with unctuous pine, Which soon inflames the wilderness sublime; Brands dashing upward, kindle as they climb; In whirling eddies round the flames are drove; Earth melts beneathâheaven languishes above. Like this, his burning locks, still unconsum'd, Whilst Death all dreadful on his breast sits plum'd. As savage Dixon led his scalpers round, He gain'd a distant prospect of the ground; To keep the serpent-fire conceal'd from view, He to himself its horrid fashion drew. He op'd his mouth, like yawning of a cave, Where murder'd travellers find their bloody grave; Soon from his throat a lonely spark appear'd, And forth another his hot breathing rear'd; Others in fiery troops succeeding came, Till mouth and nostrils pour'd continu'd flame. So when rough iron is in furnace cast To be reduc'd to fluid by the blast; Scarce seen, at first, the bellows stir the fire, But every breath augments its burning higher; A cloud of nimble smokeâthen, sparkles rise, A flickering flame starts upâas sudden dies; It lives againâit fallsâagain revives, But soon unbroken o'er the furnace drives. Thus from the throat of the infernal sire, At first, at intervals, flash'd sparks of fire; But soon augmented to a burning vast, Like that excited by the furnace blast. Urg'd by attraction, lo, the lightning stays Its maddening flashâand mild in circles plays; Around his neck, and round, it winds and winds, As when a snake a sleeping reaper binds. At length, wound upâthe Fiend devoid of pain, Uncoils the fiery links of lightning chain; Then to a ball he rolls it in his hand, And forth devours it, as a morsel bland. This doneâupon the fort he drops the cloud, Which blinds the whole as with a covering shroud, So deep that Croghan marks not Dixon's race Moving unheard, to cause his life to cease; Nor can his eye discern the files of Short, Ready at Dixon's yell to rush the fort. His purpose thus achiev'd he leaves the sky, And mixes careless with the enemy. The time that Dixon led his fiends around To invade the southern angle of the mound, Short to his legions thus: âSoon shall we hear The sign to rush to give them to the spear; This sudden darkness favours our design, For not an eye can pierce our moving line; Press to the mark, and drive the work of deathâ Transfix vitalityâplunge souls beneath. âBut curb must we, till Dixon passes round South of the fort, and gives the signal sound; Then it is ours the parapet to leap, And strike their bosoms with the bayonet deep. âThe darkness fades! The shouting has begun! Charge, warriors! charge!âwith pointed steel, charge on!â His column heard the order. Thirsting for blood, They rush'd in arms, with sound like torrent flood. The youths, in breathless silence, stood prepar'd The every bastion of the fort to guard, Defying all surprise, though compass'd round With mist imperviousâyet they catch the sound Of every breathing breath with ready ear; But scarce a whisper travels through the sphere; The foe was cautious, that no sound should break, The least suspicion in their minds to wake. But what is hearing, feeling, smelling, taste, To sight, which spreads creation like a feast! This sense shut out, the others are a dream; Scarce are they worth a momentary gleam, Which to the soul quick passes through the eye, Holding sweet converse with the Deity. Of sight depriv'dâat length their spirits droop; The Stars look dim, the Eagle seems to stoop; Croghan, who never felt a chill before, Now feels it icy to his inmost core; He breathes the anguish of his soul to heaven: âO Thou! from whom the quickening light is given! Scatter this cloud, which blinds the holy sun; Give us but light, and let our life be done!â Swift it ascended on the wing of thoughtâ Brief was this answer to the Goddess brought: âAccepted is his prayer!â From Deity A seraph bore it, wing'd on ecstacy. Fredonia drank the musick on her car, And forth descended to the scene of warâ Th' infernal cloud contracted as she came, Before her breath it vanish'd like a flame! Lo, as the savage crouching were conceal'd, Ready to springâtheir purpose was reveal'd! Hunter the moment with a prospect good, With many a death-wound drove them to the wood. As when Virginians travelling to the west To till the bosom of Kentucky, blest With fattening lifeâat night beside a spring Pitch their abode, till morn's bright star should bring The promise of a day. The moon is dark, And veil'd in heaven is every jewel spark; Thus favour'd, lo, a band of russians sly, Compass their lines with evil in their eye, To seize the booty, and their flight make good By flying to the darkness of the wood; While in this hope, their bosoms beating proud, Behold, the moon between a parted cloud Shines broad in heaven,ârevealing their disguise In open prospect to the travellers' eyes, Who boldly seize upon their arms at hand, And drive the felons bleeding from the land. So Hunter, when unknown, celestial breath Scatter'd the cloud, which dropp'd the dew of death, Blaz'd at the crouching enemy a stream, Which rous'd them gory from their tranceful dream; With death scream many from their posture sprung, And never more was heard their savage tongue. The rushing columns in command of Short, Dampen, and scatter by the same report; But to their fears he bends an eye that flamesâ And thus upbraiding, wrathfully exclaims: âWhat has made dry the fountain of your blood? Are ye not royal? Is your strength subdu'd? Death shall the coward seize! Each fear begone! A solid movement, and the strife is done!â As clouds are gather'd by the voice of storm, So at his threat'ning the battalions form, Casting a stern defiance at the walls, Regardless of the nest of sleeping balls: âLet scowling darkness muffle up each brow! Prepare to strike a massacreing blow! Riot in blood! Let saint, nor angel live! No term of mercy to the kneeling give!â âDamn the yankees! give them no quarters!ââ Short. At the hell mandate, all his form grew dark, Straining his features with infernal mark, Like to a culprit strangled by the cord, Bursting his eyeballs with a look abhorr'd. Foaming, a tyger, to the trench he strode Muttering, the youths to smother them in blood; His squadrons press revengeful on his rear, Not dreaming death, that stares upon them near. The meantime Croghan waited with desire; Watching their movements with an eye of fire. Soon fills the trench with the progressing crowd, Like the deep swarming of an insect cloud; To Meaks he gives the token with his sword; At once, the warrior comprehends the word, And whirls the linstock to excite the fire, Which as it kindles seems a blazing spire; When in full glow, to where the priming lies, He brings it down with nice discerning eyes, His bosom throbbing with anxieties. The sulphur'd dust the instant shows its strife; The starting cannon thunders into life! Recharg'd with rapidness, it flames again; Againâagainâit magnifies the slain, While Johnson's band, with levell'd weapons, pour A vollied stream, which bathes their breasts in gore. The searching balls the enemy pursue, And many a beating of a heart subdue; Those that have life, limp awkward o'er the plain, Sprinkling their staggering path with gory stain. At length they shelter in their bulwarks strong, And War in silence muffles up his tongue; The fort defenders charge the brass the same, The prime place ready to receive the flame. Shipp, Hunter, Johnson, Butler, Anthony, Form in a solid for the enemy, Should they but dare to move upon them more, To cause a tide of blood to wash the shore. Soon, by the influence of the unseen Power, The Britons rise, regardless of the shower That pour'd a fiery besom at their life, Which drain'd the hearts of hundreds in the strife. Gordon, by Proctor's mandate rules the whole, For Short was now resigning up his soul. Gordon, this speech declar'd: âWith royal port, Solid in wedge, we enter in the fort! What! and shall boys our energies resist? No: proudly on, and make them give like mist. Reveal the untam'd Lion in his rage; Let sword and steel lean forward to engage; The brow hard wrinkle, and tight cramp the breathâ Slaughter,âconsume,âannihilate in death,â As deep with heavy tread they beat the ground, Their labouring feet like distant thunders sound, Clouds of black dust in whirling eddies rise, Eclipse their bayonets, and obscure the skies? Like ocean heav'd in waves they roll their force, Or mad streams bursting from their rocky source; They crowd the trenchmentâpress the recent dead, Mangling their bodies with a slippery tread. Lo Croghan waves his falchion as before! The cannon answers with redoubling roar! The burning rifles follow swift behind; A scream of death comes riding on the wind! The tubes of fire, quick-charg'd, repeat the flame; From quivering hearts blood gushes in a stream! A remnant fly bewilder'd with despair, While numbers fall and breathe their lives out there. And now, the Fiend beheld the moment his, Or the boy triumphs o'er his enemies. He calls the globe within him to aspire; Lo! forth it comes, and quickens into fire; With matchless strength, save that of heavenly might, He hurls it from his hand, the fort to smite; He casts no eye behind him as it flew, For, lo, Fredonia visible he knew! Forth, when the lightning ball forsook his hand, It spread like thousand vipers o'er the sand, Hissing with tongues of fire. This no eye saw, Save her's, who rode sublime upon her car; But she, its flaming violence beheld, And interpos'd the virtue of her shield; The serpent lightnings wound in torment there, And then, like smoke, dissolv'd away in air. During the panick, Proctor on the rear Stood in his trembling, exercis'd by fear. Perchance, a rifle glancing by his head; He fell, and gasp'd, as number'd with the dead; His quivering flesh with damps of death grew pale; His pulse faint-fluttering, show'd his being frail. Elliot and Dixon saw him in his fall, And hurrying, rais'd and bore him to his yawl, While the young patriots made the cannon roar, Sweeping, at times, whole ranks upon the shore. With deathful look, glaring from mind to mind, Glad with their life, they left their all behind, Leap'd to their bargesâsnatch'd the ready oar, And skim'd the waters crimson'd with their gore. Their fainted general, (slaughter'd, as was thought,) Now gasp'd to taste the air!âconvuls'd effortâ Elliot affrighted, with astonish'd air, Startedâa horror lifting every hair; His knees relax'd, against the other knock'd, When Proctor thus his foaming jaws unlock'd: âWhat visages are these that stand apart, Showing their wounds? I never slew thee, Hart! 'Twas Elliot promis'd to convey thee o'erâ Not meâCawataw from thy bosom tore Thy rooted heart. What, ghost of Hickman, too! I sent a guardâwhat more that I could do? MacCracken, Woolforkâwhy do you appear? Never you I sawâElliot, he was near, Aiding the massacre! What scalps you hold Dropping fresh blood! Strange answer: British gold. If gold hath murder done, why visit me? I never scalp'd the head of enemy. âWhence issue forth these flames? And must I go With these black ministers to endless wo? Is this the gulf of Tartarus? This blast From out of hell? And here, must I be cast! Alas, my guilt! O that my hands were pure! This rack, this rack! my heart can ne'er endure!â Here broke his dreaming tongue in wildest roar, So much like hell, each bargeman dropp'd his oar; The surgeon, thinking that his brain was harm'd, Open'd his temple vein, and soon his wildness calm'd. When Croghan saw the enemy retire, To aid the wounded fill'd his whole desire. That soul, which kindled when the tempest grew, Was soft as woman, when the storm withdrew. The cry for water pierc'd him to the heart: âHaste, my young friends, the blessing to impart; With cooling drops their burning pangs assuage; Relieve with mercy, and forget their rage.â The youths with pity melting in their eye, With streams of life their enemy supply; They bind their wounds, which keen with anguish burnâ For schemes of murder blessings they return! Croghan spied Short upon the verge of death, Panting and struggling for a gasp of breath; His heart, the moment, yearn'd to give him aid; Soft he approach'dâand, with his left hand laid Beneath his head,âsupported, wash'd his brow, And then the draught presented to his foe! Short drank the fountainâthen, slow turn'd his eye, And saw the youth, his generous enemy; His soul quick melted with its passion dumb, And the small flutter of his heart o'ercome; For lo, the draught had half his nerves restrung; And partial gave a motion to his tongue; But Croghan's kindness took his strength away; He spoke one tearâbut nothing more could say; For now, remote from Proctor and his clan, The dying Briton felt himself a man. His passions having ebb'd, small power returnsâ Dim with its light his lamp of being burns: His tongue found utterance: âLetâO let me go To find my homeâthe gulf that yawns below! O what a list before my sight will rise To fix my soul in penal miseries! âCanst thou, fair youth, forgive the crimes I have, And soothe my soul whilst hovering o'er the grave? Thou canst! I read it in thy brimming eye; But wo is me!âhow miserable I die! My heart was bent to mar thy youthful bloom, And shroud thine angel virtues in the tomb! But O, repentance from that heart receive; I can no moreâ'tis all I have to give; Grant my request to press thee by the hand, Ere my soul travels that unheard-of land.â Croghan, his hand reach'd forth, which thrice he press'd Soft to his lips, then laid it on his breast: âIn peace I now retireâFareâfare thee well; I visit regions that no tongue can tell!â Croghan sustain'd him, pillow'd on his breast, And sooth'd his spirit, as it sunk to rest! So bright in heaven the godlike deed appears, Angels beheld it with their eyes in tears. Fredonia comes, and from her rainbow'd car Proclaims her son to every listening star: âBrighten your beams, ye Sun, and Planets seven! And cast new brilliance through the crystal heaven; Or Croghan's name your virtues will excel; Yea: with its light your golden orbits veil; The peopled heaven with rapture leave the sky To gaze with wonder on mortality!â CANTO XVII. PERRY'S VICTORY. ARGUMENT. Tecumseh retreats from Fort Meigs .... Elliot's Night Expedition .... Perry sails from Black Rock .... Having discovered the enemy, he retires to Put-in-bay .... The sailing of the British .... The Battle. The scene is laid at Fort Meigs, Black Rock, and on different parts of Lake Eric .... The book ends three days after Croghan's defence of Fort Sandusky. Meanwhile Tecumseh, Proctor to support, Tax'd his invention to deceive the fort; Battles contriving with superior skill To draw the patriot army from the hill; But well the heroes his intentions scann'd, And render'd vain what he with judgment plann'd. Now as the sun descends the western deep, Soft on the mountain tops, like Love in sleep, His last rays linger. Soon night's virgin queen, Touch'd with a bashful modesty is seen, Fair, brightening in mid heaven. Like a coy maid, At times she veils her beauty in a shade; At times, from curling mist, her cheek she shows, And on the gazing Sun a love-glance throws, Which he, enraptur'd, catches from her eye, And back returns it, burnishing the sky. His notice fills her bosom with delight; To grace her form more pleasing to his sight, She calls the Stars: forth, at her voice serene, They come with dancing o'er the mighty scene; Adorn her snowy bosom, and bedeck With starry chain the beauty of her neck. These gems ethereal elevate her charms, And all her lover into transport warms; He sends a kiss, in which his soul is given Sweeter than manna from the hand of heaven, To touch her dewy lips, and silent tell, How with her loveliness his affections thrill. Smooth it glides forth upon a cloud of light, Like that which wraps a messenger of night, Sent to attend the sainted of the earth, And bear to heaven their aspirations forth. It weds her rose-bud lips! A bashful glow Runs through her heart, and blushes on her brow; She turns with languishment her cheek aside, Like the delicious passion of a bride; But lo, the kissing cloud dissolv'd away, Her smile of love makes heaven and earth look gay. When Chambers saw the regal effort lost, He, calm in mind, the rest a panick host, Ponder'd the state in which Tecumseh stood; Void of support and barr'd by Erie's flood. Scarce the thought reach'd him, when he leap'd his horse, And as the moon was smiling in her course, He found Tecumseh in his depth of mind, Searching for plans his enemy to blind: âTecumseh, break thy musing! Lo, I come, Press'd with defeat, to speak to thee of home! Our promis'd triumph is a field of blood! Yea, all our prospects are in widowhood! My soul reluctant manifests the truthâ We've been disaster'd by a beardless youth! Mine eyes saw Proctor like a dead man fallâ Dixon and Elliot bore him to his yawl. âThere's nothing royal to sustain you hereâ And all Kentucky is in progress near! Johnson, a chief with terror in his name, Hath pass'd with mounted arms Ohio's stream; And Perry now is practising to sail; Alas, should Barclay in the action fail! But never can I think that grief will be. No moreâbut backward for thy safety flee.â Tecumseh darkening stood. His jutting brow Gather'd a frown, while passion's fiery glow Flash'd from his eye. He look'd an ancient tower, When clouds and moonlight mix the solemn hour; Which prov'd the workings of his soul within His bosom, smothering sighs. At length his words begin: âDefeated! Proctor dead! What, can a boy, A sapling youth, the forest oak destroy? âOur hope, Tekelah, is a cloud of night; A bud scarce blossom'd puts us to the flight! Proctor, me dig his heartâhis blood you drainâ Why talk of himâalready is he slain. âWe now, with Reynolds, will new death prepareâ Tecumseh yet feels nothing of despair.â A savage silence through the wild-men reigns; They feel as ice were curdling in their veins; Still as a morning mist they leave the shore, And dead with heavy motion labouring swing the oar. A thrill of gladness the Columbians felt, When they beheld the savage darkness melt. Their joy was like a hunter seeking game On Deer-Grove Island in Ohio's stream; But while the stag he eagerly pursu'd, Rains, pouring from the mountains, swell'd the flood, And sunk his skiff! He came and found his bark Lost in the streamâand all his hopes were dark; Th' augmenting waves still magnify his dread, That soon they'd rise and o'er the Island spread! At length, when three long tedious days were past, While the clear moon her silver image cast Deep in the flooding mirror, lo, his eye Perceiv'd the waters were receding by, Smooth creeping down the beach, sand after sand, Which make the feelings of his heart expand; Soon by its hawser fast, his light skiff show'd, And through his breast a rushing gladness flow'd. Such was the patriots' joy, when, like a stream, Their foes retir'd beneath the lunar beam. But Shelby, sage with years: âWisdom sedate Forbids th' affections sudden to elate; First, learn the cause, before our passions rise, Or it might lure us to a sacrifice; Perhaps, they've only an excursion made, T' entice, and lead us to an ambuscade; Tecumseh knows the circle of his art; A thinking headâan executing heart.â His prudent council calm'd their hasty joyâ But who approaches? Shipp, the smooth-cheek boy! Him Croghan sent to manifest the news, And learn what future were the general's views: âWe've met the savage and the royal powers, And fought the fight, and victory is ours!â As when a man, that never musick heard Of human voice, or happy spring-time bird, His hearing organs clos'dâforever deaf, Though far he'd travell'd to obtain relief; At length a physick in his art is found, Who bores the ear-drum and lets in the sound; The deaf man dances with his soul made young, To hear the speaking musick of the tongue. So when the youth proclaim'd the triumph o'er, Lo, each forgot he'd ever heard before! They stood in wonderâthen, their banners round They wav'd, and fill'd the arch of heaven with sound; At signal given, the shouting joy was done, And Shipp, proceeding with a blush, begun: âNo crimson drop from Freedom's veins was shedâ We stood reserv'd as you instructing said; But when we open'd, hundreds felt the blow, And sunk like harvest by the scythe brought low; They drove a second charge,âresult the same; There lives were gone, like feathers in a flame; Short pour'd his bloodâthen Gordon press'd the fieldâ And rumour circulates that Proctor's kill'd; Those that had breath, in panick fled the shore, And, for their safety, bent upon the oar. âAs the foe scatter'd, like a hound-chac'd flock, Claxton the fortress enter'd from the Rock; The ships of Perry are in battle trim, At the first breeze upon the lake to swim; This he desires,âthat you will here maintain Your flag, till he shall death or vict'ry gain. âI took his messageâbade him to return, To reach the fort, while heaven with stars should burn. âCroghan awaits your orders to remain, Or hitherward to lead his gallant train.â âInform the youth to wave his standard here, Whose name endures until the final year Shall end the sum of things, and bring to view The day that fashions the creation new! âWarriors! I mark impatience in your glanceâ But wisdom bends, as bends the circumstance. Johnson approaches with his mounted horse; Barry and Crittenden to give us force. âNow, as the conflict on the lake shall bear, So different motives will demand our care, Offensive or defensive. Mark the wordâ Till Perry sinks or swims, we sheathe the sword.â Shipp brief returns. To post the forted hie, To wait whose standard gains the victory. When Hull's defeat, like pestilence, transpir'd, Perry, t' accomplish what his soul desir'd, A navy plann'd to navigate the lake, Th' imperious boastings of the foe to break. Long had the oaks, like ancient patriots, bent Their leafy honours to the element,â To be constructed to elance the flame Of battle-thunder to the British name. Rude in their place the future ships commenc'd, While Perry equal every part dispens'd To different craftsmen, as their knowledge heldâ Some in the roughâsome, finishing excell'd. He gave a quickening impulse to their toil By winning words and approbating smile. So when, in June, young bees commence their hive, With emulative diligence alive, They press their curious work: Part in the vale Gather the wax to build the citadel; These freight their little thighs, and homeward hie To ease their burdens for a fresh supply; Part temper down the unctuous mortar bland, And form it ready to another's hand, Who moulds the waxen cells with searchless art; Smoothing with honied tongue each rugged part; Ambitious each the other to excel, The queen encouraging the doers well: So, like the bees, they labour'd on the fleet, Warm'd with the fire of emulative heat; Beneath their hands the ships like fiction rose, As though impatient with the foe to close. Now, as at evening they remit their toil, They on the lake descry a royal sail, Which, as the sun withdraws his farewell beam, Cast with a splash their anchors in the stream; Beneath the guns of Erie's fort they ride, Their flags light waving, imaged in the tide; Laden with battle-axesâswords and pikes, And furs collected from the upper lakes, And other implements of war from York, The place of armsâtransported for the work. The larger vessel, anchor'd next the shore, Was Adams nam'dâonce Freedom's flag she bore; But since the period Hull to Brock resign'd, The Cross has floated o'er her sails of wind. The second bears the Caledonian name, That virtue had to wake the Scots to fame, When Bruce and Wallace on her mountains stood, And stain'd her rivers with the English blood; But now she crouches 'neath the Lion's mainâ Kissing the links of her enslaving chain! Instant the patriots, gazing from their shores, Beheld the vessels anchor'd with their stores, A daring impulse quicken'd in their blood To sally forth and seize them on the flood. The breast of Elliot felt the warmest glowâ Second to Perry to defy the foe. The State of Mary gave the seaman birth, Whose yellow wheat is gold upon the earth; Here grew the mariner. Now for the cause Of brothers slave-impress'd his sword he draws. While each beheld them with desiring eyes, He thus to Perry touch'd the enterprise: âI crave thy counsel, whether to proceedâ I feel inclin'd to grapple for the deed; At the twelfth watch the moon descends the west, Then will it be to strike them in their rest.â Perry was brief in answer: âWell I know Thy heart is valour's empireâStrike the blow!â Sustain'd by Perry thusâhe forth aloud Proclaim'd his purpose to th' expecting crowd: âYe gazing patriots! who of you will dare To venture forth and seize yon vessels there? Ere harbinger of day in heaven shall shine, They to the Star of Freedom shall resign; Who can behold the Cross in triumph ride On yonder Adams, and not feel a pride Burn in his breast to snatch her from the foe, And place the Eagle on the Lion's brow?â Both land and water-men at once arise And claim the dangers to effect the prize; Towson, ere long to rank in honour high, By casting death from his artillery; Brooks, young as Croghan, fair as spring-day mornâ But soon his beauty must to heaven return; Turner, and Cummings, Watts, and Chambers, Roach, And Cuyler, Baker, for their fame approach. Two passions vacillate in Elliot's eyeâ Joy for their valourâbut to pass it by In hearts that beat with longing to receive, E'en a brief fractionâmakes his heart to grieveâ Yet, like the spots that on the sun appear, It shows the brightness of his soul more clear: âYour spirit is a fire! Yet pain and joy Mix in my heart: your pressing for employ Is gladness to my soul. But all I ask, Are but twice fifty to perform the task, Hence, a denial numbers must receive, And this the cause that makes my heart to grieve: 'Tis fame to will the deed: Two barges all To be requir'd to make the vessels fall. âBy lots must I this nobleness decide; Equal between the land and fleet divide.â With ready pen he number'dâcast the lotsâ The prize the richest was receiv'd by Wattsâ Towson the second number. Roach the nextâ Cummings the fourthâand soon the whole were fix'd. Few were the orders Elliot gave his band: âWatts, you'll conduct the fifty of the land; And Towson, you, his daring will promote; Roach, Cummings, you'll with me. 'Tis time we float; The star of evening has retir'd to rest, And the bent moon is sinking in the west.â Scarce died the echo of the welcome sound, When each divided band with nimble bound Leap'd in the barges. Baldricks held secure Pistol and dagger-bladeâdeath's furniture, The former prim'd and ready with the ball To cause the life of enemy to fall; And bristling pikes cast icy from each yawl A gleam, that struck severe upon the eye, To fill the mind with mortal tragedy; For yet a moon beam, wandering o'er the night, Lit on the steel, thence glanc'd upon the sight. No whisper heard, with muffled blades they sweep, Like passing shades, the bosom of the deep. Now half the raven wing of night has flownâ The horned moon, that hitherto had shone, Dips her bright edge of silver in the deep, Whilst busy life is hush'd away in sleep; A midnight mist ascending dims each star, As smooth they seek the drowsy ships afar. By the shrill watch-guard speaking, âall things well,â Their distance bordering on the foe they tell; And Elliot whispers Watts: âSlacken the oar! Listâby the echo we approach the shore; Behold them press'd with slumber on the deep; 'Tis yours upon the Scottish name to leap, While simultaneous on the Adams near We strike, and force submission with the spear; When barr'd the crew, divide the cable short, And urge the sails to bear you from the fort. âNow let each arm put forth its sinewy might, And dash the barges! Valour crowns the night!â The rowers caught the mandate from his tongue, And with bold impulse,âheart and sinews strong,â Drove the yawls swift though silently along. The sentries, reckless of the danger nigh, Retain their post, as formal policy; But, lo, as safety echo'd from their tongue, The patriots sudden on the vessels sprung, And broke their fatal trance!â Thus on the deep Two sluggish whales were anchor'd in their sleep, When sword-fish, passing at a distance by, Beheld, and rous'd their ancient enmity; In two divisions equal they divide, And smooth approach them cautious through the tide; To plan, they rest a moment on the sin, Then, with a dart, they thrust their weapons in; The whales awaken with their sides in blood; Surpris'd, they groanâtheir energies subdu'd. So the first notice to the ships asleep Of hostile boarders gliding through the deep, Was their life's crimson mixing in the wave, Which to their nerves a trembling palsy gave. But soon the Albions, rous'd from their alarms, Rush in their strength, repelling arms with arms; Through Cummings' better foot a bayonet gleams, And other patriots pour their blood in streams. At length the foremost of the royals failâ The rest, full soon, in their submission quail; The brave part cablesâsheet the top-sails homeâ The waves divided, round the vessels foam. Watts o'er the lake with Caledonia glides, And all th' exertions of the foe derides, For now, the forted enemy alarm'd, Strove to regain their valu'd ships disarm'd: But Adams, deeper keel'd, more water drank, By which she grounded near the Albion bank! The victors felt their swelling hearts give back, To think their prize must crumble to a wreck. Thus a keen hawk with water-piercing eye, While sailing on the bosom of the sky, In the Potomack, kens the finny brood, Reckless of danger, sporting in the flood; Behold, a pike, possess'd of equal strength, Attempts the bird to shoot his wing at length; He drops with open clawsâfastens his prey, And partial bears it to the shore away; But at the bank, with alders stooping o'er, In vain he flaps his sinew'd wings to soar: So when the keel stood fasten'd in the sand, Hope vanish'd from the bosom of the band To keep the prize. And instant of the broach, Elliot with hurried speech instructed Roach: âLoosen the pinnace!âbear the captives o'er, And see them landed on the nearest shore; Dash, on return, the waters into spray To float the richest of the spoils away; The barges from the Rock must give us aidâ The hour is darkâbut scorn to be dismay'd.â The boat was ready ere the closing word Rapid was given. The Britons pass'd on board The restless yawl,âwhich forth with spirit flew, And made the cove where Watts his ship hove to; Hurrying he lands the captives on the shore, And swift returns with all that bear an oar. While this was done, the Albions in retort, Levell'd their massive engines from the fort; Whose nimble flashes scorch'd the veil of night, But soon the valiant darted back the light: âReturn them blaze for blaze!â Elliot exclaim'd, Let every hero show himself inflam'd; Let cannon burstâlet bombs in chorus riseâ Till the last pulse-beat vindicate the prize!â The ships' deep thunders to the fort reply, Which mix and roll terrifick through the sky; Bombs with red circles from tho lake are driven, Like mad stars shooting o'er the face of heaven; Th' explosion deafens as the globes rebound, And many a life falls broken at a sound. A bolt with hissing from the fortress came, And took from Cuyler all his future fame; For many a field he proudly would have sought, And with the bravest of the valiant fought; Like a young cedar by the lake he grew, And naught but wood-land innocence he knew. His father told him of the battle day, When royals fledâtheir ranks in disarray; Then, with a sigh, he'd mention Mercer's name, And Warren's death, his country to redeem; But at the time, delicious would appear A smile, that seem'd like sporting with his tear. This warm'd the tender bosom of his son: Made his cheek kindle, and his blood to run; And when the war-note from the ocean came, For British tyrannies to Freedom's name, He took the weapon which his father held, And sought the foremost dangers of the field. The cruel bolt unsparing broke his side, Unstrung his heart, and hurl'd him in the tide. Others lie bleeding with unsightly wounds, While fort and ship repeat incessant rounds. At length the dust that quickens into life, Becomes exhausted in th' exhausting strife; But at this juncture, darting from the cove, The boats arrive the valiant to remove; Watts, Towson, Baker, Brooks, had join'd with Roach; Elliot gives order as their yawls approach: âLet every hero presently retireâ Spent is the magazineâno gun can fireâ At your departure I the ship shall burn, Then, in the skiff, I'll hasten my return.â Thus he. Roach answer'd: âNever will I go, And leave you single in this night of wo.â âNo time for etiquette. Our means are spent; Two to assist us will be competent.â By this, with treasures were the barges stow'd, And back to harbour by the crew were row'd. Meantime with toil, the unsubmitting four Apply the mortarâreeking every pore. As the last shell with double blast expires, They touch the vessel with consuming fires, And Elliot last on board the skiff retires. The flame instinctive streaks the unctuous seams, Swift as the boreal night-fire, when it streams; Around th' aspiring mast the flashes curl, And shoot above them with a flickering whirl; The blazing cinders through the void are driven; The stars seem darken'd on their thrones in heaven; The scowling night shrinks backward to the pole, And leaves a horror that astounds the soul. As when a murky cloud in midnight drear, Comes with grim aspect from the northern sphere, Pregnant to bursting with the embryo storms, Whilst round its skirts, on meteors, ride the forms Of spirits burst their graves! Its thunders break In peals, that cause the mountain beds to shake, While lightnings, brewing on its dungeon breast, Fill with strange fire the regions of the west. So on the eddying winds the flames arise, And, wild with fury, kindle to the skies. The ship consum'd, they yield themselves to sleep. Ready at day to launch into the deep Their maiden navy with its sails in trim, On the clear bosom of the lake to swim. At dawn's first glimmer streaking o'er the skies, The naval heroes from their slumberings rise; 'Twas the same morning of the signal day, That Croghan swept his enemies away, They launch their ships, completed at the Rock, Whose beauteous forms all other vessels mock; Like young swans buoyant on the wave they swim, With streamers dress'd like brides in marriage trim. Beyond the harbour, they at evening move, And patient rest within a sheltering cove, Till Perry's voice like musick in the gale, Shall speak to weigh and spread the willing sail. Bright in the east, where yonder mountains loom. Morning comes blushing in her virgin bloom, Veil'd in a cloud of gold: her eyes divine In every pearl-drop with love glances shine; The liquid diamonds, quivering with delight, In mimick rainbows render back the light; The flowers full-bosom'd, bath'd in holy dew, Breathe a pure incense, like creation new. Perry proclaims the navy to unmoor: âLoosen the anchors, and forsake the shore! The morning calls us with abright'ning glow To seek and offer battle to the foe; The time is now, by daring enterprise, The lake of Erie to immortalize. But words are vanityâto act is brave; When lock'd in fight to smile upon the grave! âThe zephyrs whisper from the gate of heaven! Let the full canvass to their breaths be given.â The mariners obey'd his flowing tongue; Part at the capstans their sea-musick sung, The hawsers tightening with the labouring song, Turning the anchors by their efforts strong, Slow heaving from the beds of shining pearl, While others high in heaven the sheets unfurl To taste the kissing breeze. The ships soon feel The anchors loosen'd, and, with narrow keel, Divide the unstirr'd waters of the cove; Like Beauty dancing on the lake they move. The Lawrence first walks stately o'er the deepâ Bearing the last that faulter'd from his Lawrence. lip, Dying in glory: âDon't give up the Ship!â Perry, with honour stamp'd upon his brow, Directs the bark in searching for the foe. The loveliest stars of the ethereal train, Shone in conjunction on the heavenly plain, And shed their brightest influence on the earth, At the blest hour that gave the hero birth. In smiling Newport, his young life begun; The Island State delighted in her son; To sail the mimick ship, he oft would stray Along the pebbled beachâa summer's day; At times he'd gaze upon the flooding tide, And ask the Deep, what cause his waves supplied; In riper years he trac'd it to the moon, In sweet conjunction with the attractive sun; And then, desire would kindle in his soul, To learn the compass, pointing to the pole. His father watch'd the genius of his mind, And left it free to ramble unconfin'd; But when he found the ocean was its bent, With glowing heart he granted his consent, And open'd all the wonder of the art, To guide the vessel by th' unerring chart; Or by the image of the changing moon; Or by the sun, when thron'd sublime at noon; Or by the stars firm center'd in the sky, From time extending to eternity. By intuition he receiv'd the truth, Such was the ready genius of his youth; He took at once the science of the sea; Strong throbb'd his heart to hound its billows free. His patriot father sent him to uphold His country's honour, where her sons were sold By ocean robbers of Tripolian birthâ A pest that preys upon the civil earth; From Preble there he learnt the naval fight; And soon he shone a youthful beam of light. And now his country, in as righteous cause, Demands his valour to defend her laws Against Impressmentânever to be nam'd With any monster ever yet was tam'd; The lion frequent at his keeper's tongue, Has smooth'd his browâhis violence unstrung. The leopardâyea, the tyger has been known, To lie all placid by their feeder down; Serpents have put their venom'd teeth aside, And lick'd the hand, which them with food suppliedâ But this fell monster of the British Isle Is far more savage, in its nature vile; Never Impressment can be nam'd with theseâ It stains with blood the bosom of the seas! Never could West his lineaments impartâ His every feature mocks the hand of art; His round, smooth cheek, luxuriant, blushing, fair, In which the lily and the rose-bud rare, Mingle with such divinity of grace, That never pencil could their beauty trace; His forehead highâhis arching eyebrows dark, His eyes of jet, pure lighted with a spark Of fire Promethean,âhis ample breast, Binding a heart, more rich than all the rest. To Perry next was Yarnall, Hamilton, With whom, but few will bear comparison; Laub, Swartwout, Taylor, Claxton, Brooks, so fair That graceful he with Perry might compare; Clark, Cummings, Forest, Edwards, Watts, the brave, Unite to guide the Lawrence through the wave. Next sails Niagara of equal power, By Elliot rul'd for the decisive hour; Turner the conquer'd Caledonia guides; And close upon her wake, the Scorpion rides; Then, Ariel, Sommers, Trippe and Porcupineâ The angry Tygress ends the squadron line. As clouds, new born in heaven, sail Erie's lake, When dewy sun-beams from the orient break And paint their folds, exquisite as they move, Delicious floating on the breath of love; Red, gold, and azure, in their beauty glow, Like the bright tints that mingle in the bow. Thus glide the ships before the sugar gales, With infant sun-beams glittering on the sails. The gladdening winds spring forth,âthe squadron flies To meet with Barclayâgrapple for the prize; Round the green shores of Canada they sweepâ Then, through the centre of the lake they keep; Shifting the helm from thence, the vessels veer, And round Columbia on the watch they steer, Burning with valour's flame to fix the fight; Yet Albion's banner flickers from their sight. But at the fading of the second sun, While foaming to the north, the squadron run, The spires of Malden reaching to the sky, Appear at distance to their watching eye; Soon in full view the harbour they behold, And Barclay, anchor'd with his canvass roll'd; Perry sublim'd, felt every nerve distend, That death or conquest would his labours end. So once, a condor from an eagle's nest Had seiz'd her young, while absent on the quest Of food to hush their wants:âWith grief of soul, She comes and finds her bosom's offspring stole Recover'd from despair, with rage she flies, Seeking her foe with never-winking eyes; Broad whirling round the heavens, she angry sails, Shifting her pinions to the shifting gales; As forth she darts, she maddens in her rage To meet the robber and with death engage; For two long days she labours through the sky, But all in vain her searching scrutiny. At length, while hope is sinking in her breast, She spies the condor snugly in her nest! She claps her pinionsâlightens for the warsâ Sharpens her beak, and grinds her pointed claws. So like the eagle, Perry mark'd the foe, Which made his bosom's blood with joy o'erflow; He furl'd his canvassâplac'd his ships in range, Ready the storm of battle to exchange. Barclay, of late, had travers'd with his fleet The waters round, to give his seamen feet; To learn the measure of his sailing speed, And practise on the lake the dreadful deed. His anchors scarce had grappled to their hold, When Perry, like a miser searching gold, Beheld the Lion and the Cross of red, Touch'd with a sunbeam from the mountain's head. Now with an optick, that enlarg'd the sight, Perry minute observ'd the royal might; And soon discover'd they in strength excell'd The ships he honour'd, for his country held; And by their movements, he was made to know, 'Twas not their purpose to exchange the blow, Till a new sun should in the orient show. The optick laid asideâhis voice was heard, Sweet in its accent as the evening bird, Calling with fond anxiety of breast Her callow young to shelter in the nest: âBehold, the setting of the sun denies, That we should meet and close our enmities; For, after battle, blessed is the peace, To pour the balm of reconciling grace. âWhat though their strength exceeds the strength of ours, Yet wish we not accession of our powers; Should we, inferior, the ascendance gain From her, the self-styl'd Mistress of the main, Brighter the brilliance of the deed would blaze, And bear our memory to future days! But should disposing heaven the vict'ry take, Ample are we to sanctify the lake! For who would live, a conquer'd vassal be? The thought be gone! We'll stand, till death shall free Our spirits from this prison-house of clay, And seek new being in eternal day! âForth to the Sister Isles for harbour steer! The battle breaks, when day illumes the sphere.â Each word was to his mariners as fire, Which warm'd their bosoms to sublime desire. To Sister Isles they navigate their wayâ And reach the same, as evening's mellow ray Melts in the lake. They anchor, sleep, by turns, While stars pour down their light from golden urns. Same time, the Britons on their couches sleep, Dreaming of Perry conquer'd on the deep; Barclay, a gem, that deck'd the Albion name, Had oft beheld the ocean in a flame; Nelson had school'd him in the naval fightâ He, who the Cross exalted to its height; Barclay, like Nelson, hath an arm but one, To wield the blade to urge the battle onâ Detroit, deep freighted with exploders strong, Bears his proud flag, the floating clouds among. The Queen Charlotte, a name that's now no more, Finnis commands, a seaman brave of yore; The Lady Prevost hearkens to Buchan, And ocean smil'd to own the valiant man; He'd fought the fight, where ships to heaven were thrownâ The Nile, that cast a brilliance on the crown; The Hunter, and the Chippewa, and Belt, Little Belt. Compose the fleetâthe last, her sister, felt Republick strength, when Rodgers taught the proud His Freedom's dignity with brass tongues loud. The royal mariners, as day's first gleam Shone in the east and flicker'd on the stream, Stood at their place, the anchors to up-weigh, When their commander should the order say; Barclay with pride their valiancy beheld, And thus the fervour of his soul reveal'd: âNow let the spirit of Britannia rise! Behold, this day, immortal is the prize! This, this the time your royalty to show, And place the crown of honour on your brow! Let lightning streak your veins! the fire reveal, Long smother'd in your bosoms!âprove the steel, That never batters edge!âI numbers mark, Who fought with Nelson at Trafalgar darkâ At Egypt's Nileâwhere colleagu'd France and Spain Found their mix'd thunders in the strife was vain! Your scars are like the seals at Judgment Day, The bless'd to separate from death's array! Thus stamp'd with an eternity of fame, Shall we not strike the infant Eagle tame? YesâI behold it, flashing from your eye! âUnlock the anchors! Let the standards fly! Never to fail, till memory shall die!â He swell'd their souls to shouting! Anchors rise, And presently they sail where Perry lies, And Barclay thus again: âMarkâmark the foe! Soon on the Crown another gem will show! âBut when yon Stars their brilliancy shall hide, Then be your souls with conquest satisfied; The turmoil violence of battle cease; And raise the conquer'd with the hand of peace; Lawrence, when he our royal Peacock slew, Kind like a brother melted for her crew; And shall they us o'erreach in acts divine? Blush at the thought!âlet mercy rule the line; Be fierce, like mad things, when the fire is castâ But do, as angels, when the storm has pass'd. âNo moreâFor action let the ships be clear! The battle comes! The foe approaches near!â With hearts high strung, the Albion crews obeyâ And stand, like instinct, ready for the fray. Fast grip'd in hand, the lighted matches smoke To touch the quick fire, when the word is spoke. The moment the Columbians saw the fleet, Their bosoms kindled with electrick heat; Their eyes quick darted an impatient glow, To meet, and mix the battle with the foe. With valour's calmness, Perry gives the word: âLoosen the anchors! Let the sheets afford A harbour for the wind to bear us forth To give the proof, that Freedom is our birth! Yea, prove our rich inheritance of blood, That none shall bend our standard on the flood. âWhy waste my voice on souls to glory givenâ No moreâOur hope is in the arm of heaven!â They felt his language at the core of life, And on their brows was calmness for the strife; An awful calmness,âsuch as nature feels, Ere the big thunder o'er the concave peals. The gales of morning in the canvass playâ It fillsâslow winds the squadron from the bay. The Lawrence ship, more fair before the wind, Outsails the others struggling on behind; But soon the breezes, languishing of life, Resign the Lawrence lonely to the strife! The rest, becalm'd, far distant on the deep, In which each patriot leans his head to weep. By this, the enemy elanc'd the shotâ The first explosion thunder'd from Charlotte; Next, the Detroit by full divisions roar'dâ And soon, the whole an iron tempest pour'd. With carronades, the Lawrence found it vain The far-off distance of the foe to gain! But Perry stood sublime! âThis, this the hour To prove th' unbending of your heart's rich power! Though volum'd fires severe against us burn, And we unable to repel in turn, Yet fix'd is our resolve to live, or die, And smile, while struggling with adversity! Heaven sends us griefs our souls to purify, And make them fit for immortality! As is our power to bear, it sends them downâ Hence, outlook death, nor murmur with a frown! âBut mark!âwe gain upon the foe ahead! 'Tis time we strike them with a blow that's dead!â He gave the mandate with serenest look, Which prov'd his valour never to be broke. Scarce had he ended, when his shouting crew Applied the match with pointed vengeance true; The globes, like pestilence, through ether fly, While nitrous smoke makes dark the noon-bright sky; Circles of fire in nimble flashes gleam, Which show a direful fracture in the stream, As though that hell were burning hideous there, With many a ghastly image in the glare. The Lawrence thus alone withstands the whole, The cannon deafening with unceasing roll. As when two thunders, darting from a cloud, Contend in air beneath a lightning shroud; Nor think they to retireâbut smiting burst With peals, that shake the tenements of dust. Thus dread they metâand thus in equal poise The battle hangsâthus dreadful is the noise. Yet Perry seems sufficient for the fleet! And dangers darkening but inflame his heat; Life fails on every side! A gush of blood Pours from each vesselâmixes with the flood; The sable ships are dyed with gory redâ The lake becomes a sepulchre of dead. A shot intended to destroy a mast, Sever'd the arm of Barclay as it pass'd; His sword fell grasp'd within his only handâ His right was buried in Trafalgar sand! Yet scorn'd his soul below to seek relief, And, in his place, the surgeons staunch'd in brief Life's jutting streamletâwrapp'd th' unsightly part, And soon he rose, unalter'd at his heart! As Laub was aiding gently to sustain A wounded youth,âtwo fiery balls in chain, From the Detroit, with whirling motion came, And where the neck of female wakens flame Sacred to loveâdrove desolating through! The live blood leaping from the arteries flew. The body fell, with a convulsion, deadâ Along the vessel roll'd the gasping head. During this period, so severe the blast, Brooks's division had expir'd their last; He comes to Perry for a fresh supplyâ A beauteous valour rolling in his eye; No smile is on his lip, but his fair cheeks Blush into roses as he kindling speaks; âLet not my voice, O Perry, damp thy breast; Ask not the cause, my cannon are at rest; Alas, th' unsparing havock of the strife, Hath robb'd my every warrior of his life! I've come t' invite thee to replace their power, That I may glory in this glorious hour! Give me their namesââ O, wherefore is it thusâ Amidst his soul's expression emulous, Ceas'd he his voice? His friends, alas for them! He fell, a lily broken from its stem! His mother's tears must fall in bitternessâ The lov'd one of his bosom, motionless Sink to the earthâa coldness seize her heart, As at the hour when mind and body part! His brittle thigh was broken on the deck, The pangs of which were tortures of the rackâ The war-bolt dash'd him 'gainst the vessel's side, And thus to Perry in despair he cried: âSnatchâseizeâO snatch the pistol from my belt! Never such anguish, mortal ever felt! O, I beseech you, sudden let me dieâ In mercy, free me from this agony!â Perry felt that he never felt beforeâ It seem'd that blood-drops stood in every pore! âCummings, Hamilton, hasteâbear him from sight, Or it may cause a palsy in the fight; I'd fix'd my soul to look unmov'd at deathâ But O, his pleadings take away my breath!â Like twin-born brothers, tender they comply; Gently they raise him with a pitying eye; But, lo, a cruel bolt from Albion sung, And the firm nerves, that bind the ancle strong, Loosen'd of Hamilton! He falls with Brooksâ Though sharp his pains, unalter'd are his looks! Or if his eye the least emotion shows, 'Tis for the youth that feels expiring throes. Cummings and Swartwout carry them belowâ Where, faint through loss of blood, they pale like snow. But nature, struggling, soon creates a flush, Hectick in Brooks's cheekâfairer that blush, Than ever play'd on beauty's love-dress flowerâ Or sweetly brighten'd in the orient hour. But like all beauty of this mortal earth, It died the instant that produc'd its birth! Brooks blush'd a moment with a feverish glow, Then his heart flutter'd and forgot its wo! The Lawrence yet defying, holds the blast, Though sails hung tatter'd from her every mast; And swords, and broken cannon, dying men, Are scatter'd roundâa desolating scene! But lo, while heroes with their death-wounds fall, The shield of heaven guards Perry from the ball! So great their love, the patriots, as they die, Turn the last motion of their fading eye To catch his sweet serenity of form, Like some bright angel mid creation's storm. At length, the Lawrence scarce maintain'd a gun, And he, to Yarnall, presently beganâ Whose cheek was swell'd and blackâhis arm was broke, His thigh was bleedingâstill an untam'd look Reveal'd to Perry, that his soul yet stood Firmâtill his life should be by death subdu'd: âYarnall, in battle with the Lawrence stand! Thy blood will be an unction to the land! From this, to the Niagara, I sailâ And urge her forthâif heaven inspires the gale! âThe valiant live not long; when dead, they bloomâ Yea, wreaths of glory flourish on their tomb! While ages roll, and millions sleep and rot, And, as the dust that buries them, forgot, A hero grows and brightens in his fame, Like the fix'd star, that pours a quenchless flame!â This said: he forth selected from the crew, Those without wounds, and to the barge-boat flew; Each to his oar with gallant effort sprung, While peals redoubling from the cannon rung. Perry erect looks calm upon the sceneâ And all he feels is safety for his men; But they the thought of living would despise, Should they behold the closing of his eyes. The barge, a thing of wonder, darts alongâ Yeaâseems like gossamer in tempest flung, For rang'd in line, the foe their thunders hurl'd To strike the insect vessel from the world; On every side incessant war they keep, Darkening the heavens and breaking up the deep. Thus from the brooding entrails of a cloud, A shower of hail descends with rattlings loud; The fire-tongu'd lightning furious drives it forth Against the golden harvest of the earth; Or hurls it, beating, at the ocean's breast, Which seems to wake in torment from its rest. So fly the ruins o'er the inland seaâ But vain the efforts of the enemy; Perry maintains the same unruffled brow, Wielding his blade, defiance of the foe; He seems like something not of human form, To breathe with life, while buried in the storm. So at the consummating hour, when Time, In heaven, shall wed Eternity sublimeâ Earth the dread change will through her centre feel; The strangled Sun to stagnant blood congeal; Comets, delirious, through the concave driven; The Moon, convuls'd, turn back her course in heaven; The mountains burnâa blast absorb the seas; And all the planetary worlds in blaze! Lo, at this change, a seraph, sent to mark If all be touch'd with the consuming spark, Will glide uninjur'd by each burning star, And smile amid the elemental war. So Perry, as with strength from heaven supplied, Moves through strange fire and thunder,âevery side. The Britons stood admiring at the deedâ And in astonishment this Barclay said: âIn history have I read of actions brave, Achiev'd by ancient heroes of the wave; Yeaâseen Trafalgar and the dreadful Nile, Where names were plac'd upon immortal file, But all that ever I have seen or read, This act of Perry's, actions past exceed! âMark, what a calmness on his brow is seen, As though he glided o'er the lake serene, Bent on his pleasure! Wonderful it seems, That he should live involv'd in fiery streams! My eye intent hath mark'd him from the first, Thinking to see him shiver to the dust; Yet, still he lives!âyeaâpasses by our fleet, Pouring its flames in one impetuous sheet! âBut will it aught avail? It never willâ He must resign to our superior skill, And ample force to bend his standards down, And make him own the prowess of the Crown; Scarce can the Lawrence answer with a gun, Which makes our strength as two oppos'd to one. âThough numbers lay in gory vestments dead, And I once more for Albion's honour bled, Yet 'tis a joy for valiant men to die, And gain, through death, a bright eternity!â As Barclay pour'd the flowings of his mind, Perry, uninjur'd, the Niagara gain'dâ Her placid sails forsaken by the wind! An holy tear delighted Elliot's eye, When Perry, leaping in the boat, drew nigh; Joy touch'd his soul to see him once againâ Him, whom his mind had number'd with the slain; For all his hope surrender'd to despair, That in the Lawrence, one had breathing there. Thus a fond mother seeks her infant child, Astray'd from home among the thickets wild; Pursuing, heedlessly, the gilded wing Of sunny butterfly, or flowers of spring; Or gathering berries with its fingers small, Till far it wander'd from its parent's call; Through the lone search, each step, she feels despairâ Toss'd in the wind, dishevell'd flies her hair; By meddling thought, half frenzy whirls her headâ Her hopes expireâshe dooms her infant dead; But lo, bewilder'd and surpris'd with joy, Plucking the berries, she beholds her boy! Her eyes stream heaven!âher soul takes wing above, Clasping his bosom with a parent's love! Such joy was Elliot's, Perry to behold, Thinking the beatings of his heart were cold. Like brothers meeting, tender they embrace; The drops of friendship trickling down their face. âHeaven yet will aid us!â Elliot stammering spoke, Soon as his passion ceas'd his voice to choke; âWhat anguish rent my soul! my heart dropp'd blood, To see the Lawrence circled on the flood By all the royal navy in a flame, It caus'd the teardrops from the brave to stream! Why do I talk? No language can declare What the soul suffer'dâevery heart was bare! So wilder'd was the mind, that thrice we arm'd To ply the matchânot thinking we were calm'd!â Thus he. And Perry thus: âElliot, I feel, Thy heart felt more, than language can reveal, Though that thy voice hath musick in its strain, Binding my soul in fascinating chain. âYes, heaven will aid us to repel the foe, If to adversity we scorn to bow; Our strength united, none divides the band; Not all the power of Europe's titled land; Yea, than to yield, 'tis sweeter far to die; Sweet as the slumber-breath of infancy! âBut mark you not yon rippling o'er the lake? It comesâit spreadsâthe winds are there awake! âO come, ye Winds! and nestle in our sailâ I hear your voice, more sweet than nightingale! O come, and elevate the Eagle's wing, She droopsâmade sick at heart with sorrowing! âBehold, they come and flicker in the sheets! Effulgent brilliancy the day completes! The Eagle throws the sickness from her heartâ She mountsâher eyes the beams of vict'ry dart; Lawrence hath open'd us the wayâand now, We'll bring our strength unbroken on the foe. âForth, Elliot, to the lagging ships proceed And bend their sails to aid the signal deed, Whilst I Niagara to the battle crowd, And from the Lawrence sweep the bleeding cloud.â Elliot, with fibres of his heart new strung, With chosen bargemen, in the pinnace sprung To gain the vessels struggling on behind, And bring them forward with the freshening wind. As Elliot reach'd the squadron on the rear, Disguis'd, Fredonia glided through the sphere; She seem'd an Eagle, grac'd with gorgeous wings, Winding between the clouds in floating rings; Her plumage glittering, wonderous to behold, As down she circled in a flood of gold. Now, on the bosom of the air she sails, Fanning with gentle wing the amorous gales; Around the fleet, admiring to the sight, She winds, like beauty circumfus'd in light; O'er Perry's head she paus'd a moment's time, And then evanish'd mid the clouds sublime. The mariners beheld with ravish'd lookâ At length, their transport into shouting broke: âLo, victory is ours! Behold the sign! It burns in heaven, like agency divine!â When Barclay heard their voices on the air, He rang'd his fleet in naval character, Fix'd for defence. When lin'd in readiness, He, like a victor, utter'd this address: âBehold, they comeâflags dancing in the wind! Lo, presently they fall, to grief resign'd; But each must gird his royal armour onâ Their banners wave to dignify the Crown! Yesâeach his proudest efforts must perform; See, they approach, like darkness in a storm! Let life's deep engine, maddening pulses, beat; No equal power reduces Albion's fleet! Yet mark my wordsâwe fight not France, nor Spainâ Some English blood runs dancing through their vein! âInflame the brass with fire! The bolts drive wellâ Let war outnoise the direst peal of hell.â With brazen lungs the cannon bellowing roar'd, And, on Niagara, their thunders pour'd. Slow gliding on, the Freedom ships drew nigh, Facing the blast in deep solemnity. But when in distance scarce the vessel's length, Her brass exploded with Vesuvian strength. Perry breaks forth: âWith crowned canvass move! This, this the hour, your energies to prove! Pressâbear the ship within a duel shot Of proud Detroit, of Prevost, and Charlotte; On these, close levelled, let the starboard pour, While larboard cannon in full concert roar, And strike the fiery Chippewa and Belt, That not as yet a bleeding round have felt; Thus, as with lightnings, streaming on each side, We'll pierce their lineâtheir battle strength divide; Their banners humbleâbow their lofty pride.â His bold design went thrilling to the heart, And each with calmness answer'd to his part; The sails they crowded, and a signal set, His plan to be supported by the fleet. When Barclay scann'd the purpose of his foe To break his line, his strength to overthrow, He by a flag proclaim'd it to his fleet, While his tongue show'd how strong his pulses beat: âMark, how Niagara bears upon us proud! Smother her progress with a fiery shroud! She sundersâbreaks the line! Defend the Crown! Hurl forthââ A torn-off splinter smote him down, Yet seem'd he not to notice that he fell: âLevel the cannon! gun for gun repel!â Full peals unbroken at Niagara rollâ But Perry moves unalter'd in his soul, Not winking at the blast. In duel shot, He rakes, and breaks the vitals of Charlotte; Prevost, Detroit, and Chippewa, and Belt, On either side, beneath the lightnings melt; Niagara seems a dragon, wing'd with fire; Her flames augmenting to the clouds aspire. Lo now, a rifle volley from marines, The upper deck of either vessel gleans; Those, that have life, for shelter fly beneath To shun the pestilence of leaden death. Buchan, an ornament to Albion's race, Craz'd by a shot that broke upon his face, With vacant eye stood gazing on the flood, Alone, unarm'd, and reckless of his blood; Yet still the rifles flung the hissing lead; Perry beheld it, and with feeling said: âThe Briton stands bewilder'd in his gore; Suppress the flamesâelance no death-lead more; His sword hath fallenâwhy expend the shot? Let mercy rule us, and forget it not!â The warriors hearken'd, and obey'd him soon; Buchan, the moment, shiver'd in a swoon; The loosen'd fibres of his heart gave way; He heav'd one gasp, and stiffen'd into clay! The Caledonia, by the wayward wind, Lags from Niagara on the wave behind; Turner, with soul impatient for the fight, Commands, that through the sail, his gun should light: âCold is that heart, which longer can delay! What! without aid, shall Perry win the day? Shall we no honour in the battle seek? Noâthrough the fore-sail, let the cannon speak!â Hardly his tongue the proclamation made, When the brass quicken'd from its slumber dead, And rent the canvass that conceal'd the foe, And caus'd the blood in a new stream to flow. The Ariel, Scorpion, close upon her glideâ Then, board to board, the Trippe and Tygress ride; And Somers next, and next the Porcupine, Urg'd by one impulse in the fight combine. Now ship to ship and gun to gun they meet, Their anger kindling with ambitious heat; As flames of Etna to the clouds are driven; As thunders meet, and mix, and crash in heavenâ Not with less rage the circling fires flash round; Not with less rage the brazen engines sound. Fragments of menâtrunksâheads, with gory hair, Splash in the lake, like things unworthy care! The crystal lake becomes a sea of gore, And still the battle magnifies it more! The foremost characters of Albion fail; Faint beat their heartsâtheir features waxing pale. Finnis, whose breast was honour to the core, Mixes with Erie's flood his bosom's gore; While in the act to animate his crew, A fire-drove bullet pierc'd his vitals through: âBritons! remember what ye are!â he cried, And roll'd his eyes to heaven, and smiling died! Now reel the masts of Albion's Charlotte; Her shrouds swing loose,âdissever'd by the shot; She tangles with Detroit, devoid of helm; In this sad plight, the patriots overwhelm The ships with raining fire. A moment brief, They seem like Frenzy overcome by Grief, At last, death's chillness on their hearts they feel; They strike their tatter'd flagsâto Freedom's banner kneel! As when a scowling tempest wraps the world; Lightnings and thunders, from its entrails hurl'd, Driving to earth a cataract of rain; Shiv'ring the oaks and dashing them amain; It passes byâthe loosen'd winds are laid; The sun paints rainbows on each dew-drop blade; The poplar stands unmov'd upon the heath; The world calm slumbers, lull'd with heaven's sweet breath. Such was the change, when Albion's standard fell, The lightnings diedâthe thunders ceas'd to swell. Perry exclaim'd: âBy heaven's indulgent Powers, We've met the enemy and they are ours!â Barclay to Perry in his sorrow came; Pale his sunk cheekâwith many a gory maim! He paus'dâand after, thus: âMost sad 'tis mine, To thee this tarnish'd honour to resign; Undying ages will exalt thy fame, Whilst deep oblivion will becloud my name!â Perry with sympathy: âThat word suppressâ 'Twas heaven that crown'd my effort with success; If arms alone could conquer, thou hadst won; What man could do, that nobly hast thou done; Oblivion, did you say? That ne'er can be, While worth o'er baseness holds ascendency; Oblivion!âneverâwounds will leave a scar, Which to the world, will speak thy character! For these deep gory stains wilt thou receive Something more rich than golden mines can give. âThe brave, at times must render up the fight, But fame encircles them with robes of light; To names, nor naval skill, the battle's given, Unless supported by the arm of heaven. âYour wounds ask medicineâCome, pass with me, Lean on my arm, and while on board be free.â The soul of Barclay crowded in his eyes; Silent he stood,ârecover'd, he replies: âYou've won my heartâyea, conquer'd me again; Thy soothing voice hath all my feelings slain; But this last victory, the first excels, As heaven this earth, where peace eternal dwells. âAccept my sword. I'm conquer'd, and resignâ A thousand more to such a heart as thine!â Perry makes answer: âNever more, I pray, Urge me that pointâsufficient is the day; Sheath'd be thy bladeâconvey it to thy land; 'Twould pierce my heart to touch it with my hand. Barclay surrenders in the strife of soul; Bending his mind to Perry's kind control. Tender the surgeons, by their sacred art, Close his rough wounds and soften every smart. Perry sets compass for Sandusky Bay; Where safe he anchors at the close of day. CANTO XVIII. INVASION OF CANADA AT MALDEN. ARGUMENT. The Northern Army being reinforced by Johnson, and receiving positive intelligence of Perry's Victory, decamp from Fort Meigs .... The Embarcation .... Proctor's Retreat to the River Thames .... Invasion of Canada .... A Night Scene. The scene is laid in Kentucky, at Fort Meigs, Sandusky, and at Malden .... The time is thirty-six hours. Meantime Kentucky, fill'd with patriot flame, Summon'd her warriors to the field of fame; Though with her blood the earth she'd sprinkled o'er, At the Miami and at Raisin's shore, Yet, jealous Freedom glowing in her breast, A Star, she rises in the dark-blue West. Her offspring listen'd to her martial tongue, Which, to their ears, was sweet as musick strung To th' Ãolian harp:âthey heardâand, at the sound, In crowded ranks, collected on the ground. Where Licking stream with the Ohio flows, Sublime in air their spangled banner rose; Licking, in ancient time, its springs pour'd forth To slack the thirst of nature's giant birth; The mammothâonce the sovereign of the wood, Till shafts of thunder the huge race subdu'd; Scarce could the stream their mighty drought supply; They drank the river, yet their throats were dry. Here was the standard of the Free up-rear'd, Where soon in arms a darkening host appear'd; As clouds, collecting in the western sphere, Proclaim a tempest to the peasant near; Grum muttering thunders groaning far remote, Sound th' alarm with heavy rumbling note; So at the junction of the mammoth's flood With the Ohioâsons of hunters crowd,â Ampleâbeyond all measure to proceed, As they by numbers would the cause impede; Hence, many a warrior, with his heart in pain, Slow, with reluctanceâmeasur'd back the plain. These, as the first that marshall'd on the field, The post of honour for their country held: Henry, in rank, is second to Desha; Then, Chyle and Trotter in the line display; Next King and Symral form upon the heath, Intent to gain th' immortalizing wreath, With which proud Vict'ry crowns her champions brave, To bid defiance to the mouldering grave. Barry, William T. Barry. whose eloquence delights the mind, And moulds the heart to tenderness refin'd, Claims from the Muse a momentary pause, Partial to give his character applause. Virginia gave him birthâso rich in names, That four, the proudest of the land she claims; Four, who than thrones had seats more high attain'd, And then, with humble gratitude, resign'd; A noble lesson to instruct mankind. His father, poor, conducted him, a child, Beyond the mountains to Kentucky wild; To the blest spot where Lexington took birth; A flower, the fairest of the western earth; Scarce yet in bloomâbut soon to wide expand, And pour its od'rous treasures through the land; Ere long, her Transylvania will proclaim Through distant realms the virtue of a name; Here, by a Holley's care, the mind receives A boon more rich, than golden treasure gives; Exalted Scienceâwhose unclouded eye Looks with a smile beyond mortality. Here pass'd his sweet simplicity of youth, Ever devoted to the shrine of truth; Though born to indigenceâwith scarce a friend To give him counsel, or his views commend, Yet, by his native energies, he rose In spite of all that envy could oppose; For envy ever will pursue the good, As shade, the substance in similitude. Kentucky gave him honour with acclaim, That in the senate, he should speak her name; Yea, and he spoke it with a voice so clear, That sages listen'd with delighted ear. Though that his soul was as a summer's day; As sweet as nature in her love-dress gay, Yet, mention but his country's wrongs, he show'd That flame indignant in his bosom glow'd. As he in senate had the war declar'd, So now its perils, he, like Johnson, dar'd. The next is Crittenden in war-robes seen; Though dark his eye, yet open is his mein. At times, his tongue would elevate the soul, And bear it high beyond the will's control; At times, by softening to a melting word, He'd damp with tears the heart's affecting chord. In hill-surrounded Frankfort, where the wise Kentucky sages righteous laws devise, Glided his years:âBut scarce he'd past the child, When the rude scenery of nature wild Gave such a musing habit to his mind, That oft he'd listen to the mountain wind To hear the Spirit of the storm declare What mighty cause produc'd the river there: If that a ploughshare, at the first of time, Drawn by an earthquake, breathing fire sublime, Turn'd hills aside with thunders in its sweep, Scooping the rock a thousand cubits deep! Or if the mountains, when the streams were dry, Disparted at the touch of Deity! These chiefs, the solid infantry command, Whose bosoms yearn against the foe to stand. Next on the field the mounted troops convene, Their hearts impatient for the martial scene; Johnson the younger, Col. Richard Mentor Johnson. nurtur'd in the west, Holds the first ruleâwho oft the stranger blest; He, in the senate, bade the nation draw Th' avenging sword to wage the righteous war; Though he had lost no kindred on the sea, By Briton's iron hand of cruelty, Remote from ocean, at his happy seat; Yet, his heart jealous, for his country beat; And when the groans of mariners impress'd, With every gale came sighing to the West, He felt in every groan, as though he heard A brother's voice, him succour to afford: This, in the nation's councils, nerv'd his tongue, And gave him power to wield the falchion strong. At the Blue Fountain he receiv'd his birth, The purest spring that gushes from the earth; Yeaâpure as is the bow of summer even; Clear as the bosom of the cloudless heaven; When thirsty Sirius drinks the western floods, And sears with parching heat the drooping woods, This Spring, upon its borders damps the fire, And keeps the foliage in its green attire. Full many a wild-flower blooms upon its side, Leaning its odorous bosom o'er the tide To gaze its beauty in the wave below; As Eve delighted saw her breasts of snow, When o'er the lake she bent her wondering beam, To view her mocking image in the stream. The warrior drank of this inspiring wave, Which to his mind a clear conception gave; He show'd his father's daring from his birth, Who now cold slumbers in his bed of earth, Where Elkhorn smooth, like molten silver flows, With sweet-brier perfum'd and the breathing rose. The chief, exalted on his charger high, A martial kindling flashes from his eye; His light plume nods like dancing in the wind, And bends elastick o'er his head behind; Gentle in peace as setting sun of even; In war, the spirit of the storm in heaven. Champing his bit, his war-horse paws the heath, Rolling a cloud of darkness at a breath; His breast bears thunder, and his eye the flame, Which burns in heaven, when tempests shake the frame; His strength is ocean's waveâhis speed the wind; His courage fire, that scorches on the mind; He snuffs the passing breezeâexulting bounds, When for the charge the clanging trumpet sounds. His heart's choice brother, Col. James Johnson. next commission held, Whom none in deeds of chivalry excell'd; In years, his seniorâbut the palm of birth He yields, which proves sublimity of worth; These little etiquettes of little minds He casts indignant to the scattering winds; His country's welfare is the guiding light That leads him forward to the field of fight: How, in what station, can he serve her best, The only trouble that concerns his breast. Payne, Thompson, Suggett, next in order stand, Rank'd with the first that ever drew a brand To wield against a foe. ButâSuggett, he Had touch'd the holy things of Deity; But now in panoply severe he shines To lead to fame Kentucky's chosen lines. Ye tongues of discord! mark the brilliant sight, And be your eyes made blinded by the light! Ye madded ministers, who preach a God, More rank than hellâwhose luxury is blood! Look at the contrast! See him fix'd on heaven, In silent prayer, that vict'ry might be given; Whilst Him, your country ye implore to sink: âGod! in thy mercy, give them blood to drink!â âThose western states which have been so violent for this abominable war of murderâthose states, which have thirsted for blood, God has given them blood to drink!ââ Rev. Elijah Parish, Byfield, Mass. Ye hypocrites in holy things! how dread Must be the weight suspended o'er your head! Sackcloth your loinsâpour ashes on your brow, And bare on earth your knees repentant bow; Or your rank blasphemy will reach to hell, And from the Book of Life your names expel! Stucker and Berry, powder'd with the frost Of wintry years, maintain an honour'd post; Combs, Redding, Warfield, Coleman, Church and Rice, Feeling the valour of invalu'd price Their fathers paid to purchase Liberty, Glimmer in steel,âwith whom are MacAfeeâ Elliston, Chambers, Davidson the boldâ Nor will the light of heaven again behold More virtue in the fieldâtheir deeds of fame Will find an immortality of name. But what fair youths are those on chargers grey, Whose looks outvie the mantling blush of day? The nephews Sons of Col. James Johnson. of the chief: Scarce have they seen, In floral beauty, summers five and ten! Stay, gentle youths, O stay! My soul feels pain To mark your daring on the martial plain; O think what tortures will your father feel, Should your fair bosoms warm the death-cold steel! ReturnâI fear me 'twill his soul unman, And check your uncle in the charging van. Ah, noâ'twill mad them to avenge your blood, The green earth sprinkling with a gory flood! Press on to glory in your youthful day, And ye shall live, (if heaven inspires my lay,) In future years: When Peace shall bless the land, I'll seek for you the softest, loveliest hand Of all the maidens roundâtheir cheeks as fair, As angel forms that float on silver air; Their eyes express divinity of love; The light of beauty shall around them move! And now the drums, with heavy beat, proclaim The time of movement to the field of fame; The shrill fifes whistle, and the bugles sound; The horse and infantry in rank, wheel round; And all like fiction move upon the ground; Johnson directs the van with native fire, To seek the foeâto conquer or expire; Their light arms sparkle with the beams of day, As on they pass in glittering files away. So while young zephyrs, with gay sportings, lave Their wanton pinions in Ohio's wave, From heaven's gold orb, majestick in its height, Rains down a lucid shower of spangling light; The rippling stream, like beauty in a dance, Makes the live sunbeams from the waters glance; The flood all brilliant with innumerous rays, Looks like the firmament in starry blaze, Flashing and quivering as the zephyrs fling O'er the pure crystalline their flickering wing; On silver feet Enchantment moves serene, And Wonder stands delighted at the scene. Thus shine their burnish'd arms as on they move, With light effulgent from the orb above. By rapid march they gain the distant fort, Ere the first gun of Perry made report; And Croghan with his band had join'd the sageâ A name to live till earth's remotest age. But soon the thunders of the naval war Tremendous bellow round the lake afar; With throbbing hearts the patriots anxious wait, To hear the battle hush'd, and learn their fate. At length, exhausted,âsilenc'd is the jar; The insects' feeble wings are heard in air; At once, so calm the unmov'd element, As though the very breath of heaven were spent; Each breast now beats with hope,âand now, with fear; They long to know,âyet dreaded they to hear What banner wav'd rejoicing in the sky, Or which had sunk in darkness mournfully. So Emmett, when arraign'd at tyrant's bar, For whispering Freedom through the land afar, Stood, while his peers were absent, or to save, Or shroud his virtues in a murderous grave; Hope for a moment brighten'd on his view, Then fear return'd, and dark the picture drew. Or as a bride, scarce wedded for a day, When, lo, her lover is compell'd away, (By Albion press'd) to battle on the flood, Leaving her soul all dark in widowhood; For many months she pours unceasing wail; To every stranger tells her pitying tale; Her eyes grow languidâand a swift decay Seizes her frame, and takes her bloom away; At length, the postâto whom 'tis frequent given To bring us grief, or tidings sweet as heavenâ Drops her a packet from the ship that bore Her heart's affection from his native shore! Convuls'd sensations in her soul she feels; She longs to hearâyet fears to break the seals; Perhaps in fever of the tropick clime, Calling her name, he sunk away from time; Perhaps, he livesâyet prison'd by the foe; Perhaps, his heart stopp'd beating at a blow; Though this, she fears, is written in the leaf, Yet still sweet hope will mingle with her grief. Thus hope and fear convulse the patriots' breast, Like clouds and sunshine changing in the west. The sun has setâstill nothing is there heard, If Perry held, or yielded up his sword; Darkness has clos'd upon its farewell light, Yet, in uncertainty remains the fight. They listen to the rustling leavesâthe windâ To hear of something to relieve the mind. At length, with momentary hope and fear, They catch the tramping of a horseman near; Claxton approaches!âwhich at once declares Whose flag the honour of the triumph bears: âVictory! Victory!â He could no more, So loud the shouting through the concave tore. As when in storm, a wintry blast drives forth; Roars in the mountainâsnaps the oak to earth; Stoops the tall pine submissive to the plain; Breaks the proud ash, and shivers it amain; Stirs the deep ocean, where its rocks are bas'd, And rolls the billows o'er the foaming waste; With equal turbulence their shouts broke forth, Which smote the heavens, and echo'd back to earth. Shelby unruffled waves a silent sword; The shouting ceases at the signal word, That Claxton might proceed: âOur vessels lay With those of Barclay, at Sandusky Bay. âAt dawn, am I instructed to declare, That to Miami will our ships repair, To sail the troops upon the adverse shore, To measure arms with Proctor's ruffian power.â Shelby exclaim'd: âFor glorious vict'ry given, Full from the heart we bless a favouring heaven! âTo Perry bear my gratitude and praise; Wreath'd are his temples with the deathless bays; Yeaâfor this deed, his name will ever live; And immortality the brave receive. The Sister Isles, in history renown'd, Will be remember'd as celestial ground; Yeaâsuch will be their reverence in years, The very sight will bring the soul to tears! âThis to the hero of the lake convey, That, glad I'll meet him on the coming day T' embark th' impatient army in his fleet, That we the foe decisive may defeat.â Claxton treasures his sentimentsâretires Back to Sandusky by the starry fires. The meantime Perry, melting at his heart, By soothing voice made blunt the pointed dart, That pierc'd the captive breast:âHis tongue's soft sound Was healing balsam for each burning wound. And now, the dust of fallen heroes deadâ To heaven, Elijah-like, their Spirits fledâ In holy earth is laidâwhile many a sigh Rolls from the braveâtears trickling from their eye. Bosom to bosom, Laub and Brooks are plac'd, Like brothers met, and in their love embrac'd; On either hand, Buchan and Finnis soft Slumber in restâtheir souls were launch'd aloft; Rich from their graves an equal fame ascends, For Death impartial makes the valiant friends. Morning, at length, with coral blush comes forth; The dancing dew-drops glitter on the earth; Soft as the light illuminates the east, The world is spread like a delicious feast Before th' enraptur'd eye, which, more it feeds On nature's banquet, more its hunger needs. Claxton, from fort returning, Perry seeks,â The veteran's answer to his ear he speaks: âThe heart of Shelby flows to you in praise, That round thy temples thou hast twin'd the bays; Lo, as he bade me utter this reply, A grateful tear was trickling from his eye. âHe, at Miami, will the navy meet, To bring the strength of Proctor at his feet.â Perry the sailing order'd: âAnchors weigh! Direct the compass for Miami's bay!â The fleets are loosen'd at the word:âcombin'd, They cleave the waters with a favouring wind. When day in heaven reveal'd its earliest sign, The army form'd in solid discipline; To whom the aged thus: âBehold, the morn At length shines forth to cause the heart to burn; With soul unbending, long have ye withstood Th' invading foeâand frequent with his blood Sprinkled the field!âOft from your presence fled His boasted veteransâleaving you his dead; Methinks in every eye proud Freedom shows, And that will conquer when in fight we close. âCroghan, my youngest son, with infant band, Scatter'd their ranks and drove them from the land; As long as courage warms a hero's breast, So long will Fame delight to make him blest. âPerry hath met them on their own domain, And there, with feebler force, their boastings slain; When lakes shall dry and rivers cease to flow, And ocean hide itself in realms below, Then, may his name be never heard of more; Lost and forgot, when waters cease to roar. âTime fails t' enlarge upon his merits due, Or speak the burning valour of his crew; The hours are on the wing!âwe forth must hie To seek the fieldâthe mind to satisfy. âDivide in marching files! Drums, musick, beat! Forward!â They move impassion'd with his heat. Th' enliv'ning echo of the drum and fife Makes the blood nimble for the promis'd strife; Shrill through the air the brazen trumps rebound, The answering bugles twang with clangorous sound; The sportive sunbeams on the armour light, From thence return in beauty to the sight; The new-born zephyrs in the streamers play, Kiss the soft silk, and wave them into day; Slow as the army winds the distant hill, The notes of musick change from hoarse to shrill, Sweetening the galeâth' advancement turns the brow, The thickening notes with heavy lumbering flow. Now, the fil'd warriors as they climb the height, Crowd into viewâthen sink below the sight; Their plumes like live things in their dancing seem; They flickering vanishâand their bayonets gleam; A moment yet their banners waving fly; But soon they sinking flutter from the eye; Still, at far distance, we the bugles hear, And the drums' rumble sounding on the ear; At times, the notes are heardâbut now, the gale Bears them away, and they forever fail. When Barclay sail'd, the Britons gave to joy Their heartsâlate broken by the dauntless boy; Croghan. They heard the battle, but no doubts had they, But Perry had resign'd th' unequal fray; In various feats they pass'd away the night; But lo, ere dawn, they learnt their conquer'd plight. Thus when in haughty Babylon of yore, While Cyrus stood before her gates with power, Her sons with luxury drunk laugh'd him to scorn, Reckless their city would be rent ere morn; With wine and feasting, passing off the night; Musick and dancing yielding them delight; Amid their revellings bursted in their foe, Which reel'd their brains with a distracted wo! Like this, at Malden, were the royal band, When Perry's triumph thunder'd round the land; A wild delirium fasten'd on their brain; The thought of Shelby shrivell'd every vein; And Harrison, the Johnsons, fierce in war, Curdled their blood and bound them in their awe. When Proctor felt his icy veins to thaw, His steed he mounted, urgent to withdraw: âRetreat! fly Malden! scatter to the Thames! But stayâthe whole first desolate with flames; We creepâwe crawl! the kindled torches ply! Methinks I see them on the waters nigh! Remote, can I discern a press of sail; And feel you not a freshness in the gale? Mark, how they crowd, successive o'er the lake! Death glimmers on their flag!â âNot possible mistake! Loose clouds of morning mock'd me with the show; They may be sailsâperhaps it is the foe! Consume the magazines without delay; And then for safety to the Thames away!â Ere he had clos'd, forth rush'd the regal bands, And touch'd, and kindled with the lighted brands The whole in blaze,âdisorder'd they retire, While the flames mounting on the winds aspire; The females shriekâth' affrighted children cry, To see the sparkles flash along the sky. Air, smoke, and flame, a dire confliction make; The same, reflected, glitters in the lake; Mad through the element the fires are driven, The whirling cinders wage rude war with heaven. The time the sun stood centred in mid day, The patriot army reach'd the destin'd bay; The navy soon the eastern point wore round; Three greeting shouts from infantry rebound! Instant the mariners their joys repeat, And high in heaven their welcome voices meet. âProud to the navy, let the guns salute!â Shelby commanded:âevery tongue was mute. Thirteen brass thunders speak to Perry's name, His brilliant triumph o'er the lake proclaim; Amid th' inspiring sound the vessels moorâ Quick skims the yawl with Perry to the shore; The veteran hurries to the beach, and stands Dismountedâas the youthful hero lands; As eager they approach, their hearts beat high, A crystal tear-drop glistens in their eye; With motion tremulous, their hands they join, Lock'd in embrace, impassion'd like divine. Thus to exalt his character in war, A youth forsakes his home and parent's care, By shivering marches in the frigid zone; Fording mud rivers; fainting in the sun; Sleeping untented in the pitiless night; His features shrunk with starving appetite; Pouring his blood while entering through the breach, He gains the summit of a warrior's reach; His country hails him with the shout of praise, And the rapt poet pours to him hir lays. When thus encircled with his fame, as light, Home he returns to glad his father's sight; Silent they meetâbreast riveted to breast, Feeling a joy that never was express'd. So stood the veteran and the seaman young, Lock'd in embrace, while passion chain'd each tongue. At length the aged thus: âThy deeds of light Exceed the power of language to recite; High at the summit mark begins thy praise; On thy great name futurity will gaze; It gives me joy, ere I the grave-path tread, To see young valour blooming o'er my head.â âI've but the service of my country done,â Thus Perry, modest, in his turn begun: âI, to my crew, your praises must transfer, 'Twas they that prov'd the nation's character. âWe'll let the subject for the present pass; Indulgent heaven gave victory as it was. âBrief to my mariners, I gave command To bear the crowded Britons to the land; Their numbers even now surpass our own, Exclusive those that with their anguish groan; These, in pavilions ample, will receive Attentions from those hands that blessings give.â Scarce had he finish'd, when the barges bore The maim'd and numerous captives to the shore. âYour kind solicitudes of heart proclaim Your bosom worthy to receive its fame; It proves a nobleness of soul to feel For those who suffer from the wounding steel.â While they this converse held, the barges gain'd The shoreâsome lost to sense, and some with fevers pain'd. Shelby to Croghan: âSoftâwith generous care To roomy tents the fainting sufferers bear;â Miller, the others to the fort convey, There to remain till the redeeming day.â This, with a ready promptness is obey'd; The maim'd in tents on pallets soft are laid; The others, Miller marshals in a file; And soon their brows he lightens with a smile; By soft-ton'd musick and by soothing arts, He draws the festering anguish from their hearts; A grateful tear is seen in many an eye, For each expected hard severity. The meantime Shelby had his post resum'd, And thus with glowing sentiments illum'd The bosoms of the brave: âWarriors! at length, The hour approaches to attest your strength; Brief is the passage to the hostile shore; And lo, a conquering fleet conveys us o'er! A conquering fleet!âhow ominous the word! A conquering army will unsheath its sword! How vain is language to excite your souls; Warm through each breast a tide of valour rolls. âWhat though my cheeks the spoils of time declare, My strength returns, like youth, the sword to bare; Avenging justice approbates the cause, Wag'd to maintain our liberty and laws. âO kneel your souls to heaven and make the vow, Never a joint on battle-field to bow; Never this lake shall bear my body o'er, Till, or we die, or overcome their power!â Deep was the pause. At length, this shout arose: âLoud plead our hearts, with savage ranks to close! By the best drops that swell our veins, we swear, To win the fight, or leave our bodies there!â âI glory to behold the native fire Burn in your bosomsâprompting your desire. âBut mark the fleet is waiting! Forth repair And crowd the decks and prove the souls ye are!â With hearts high beating, they receiv'd the wordâ Sunder'd their ranks to pass the fleet on board; Perry conducts the veteran Shelby forth; The barge that bears them, weighted with their worth, Deep settles in the wave. The Johnsons leave the shore With sounding bugles, confident of power; Next, with artillery, Woodâand then Desha; Then Symral's squadrons launch into the bay; Chyle, Barry, Crittenden, and Trotter, King; Croghan, Harrison, the rear barge honouring. Now Perry's standard from Niagara flies, That the bent fastenings from the sand should rise; The seaboys mark the signalâanchors weigh; Slow winds the freighted navy from the bay; The sheets like clouds expand before the breeze; Smooth glide the vessels o'er the silver seas; The waters seem with pride to bear the line, Such bright reflections in the mirror shine Of starry banners wavingâhelmets, plumes, And burnish'd armour, which the sun illumes. The sportive fishes in the wave below, With wondering eyes behold the beauteous show; Eager they dart to catch the shades that move, Mocking the fleet that swims with joy above; Then leap to taste the air in antick play, Wild, like the sportings of a holiday. The sea-lads plac'd upon the mast on high, Distant, a promise of the land descry; Like a faint cloud, where earth and sky unite, Hard to discern by those of practis'd sight; By small degrees, it grows upon the view; Its colour changes from a gray to blue; As glad the squadron gains upon it near, Unequal ridges more distinct appear; Soon mark the crew the ruins,âwhere arise The sluggish smoke, that rolls along the skies. At length, the navy enters in the bay; The biting anchors grapple to the clay. A signal cannon from Niagara comes, Which, with loud peal, is answer'd by the drums; Notice to land. The notice is obey'd; And soon the whole are on the beach array'd. âBehold, we've landed!â Harrison exclaims: But not like Hull to infamy our names; This, this the crisis, that demands the soul To stand sublime, defying death's control; Should this, our effort failâour cause is done; The sands of Freedom are forever run; The bow is bent, and should the arrow fly Without effectâfarewell to Liberty!â When Malden's timid fair beheld the fleet, Their hearts sunk in them with a trembling beat; The sad-forsaken matrons wrung their hands, Fearing their death from the Kentuckian bands; Proctor had told, that riot was their aim, And reckless murder did their hearts inflame. Lo, when the columns form'd upon the shore, Their shrieks ascended, freezing every pore; With shoeless feetâheads naked to the wind, They ran together with disorder'd mind; A pale destruction glar'd from every face; Their bosom child they gave its last embrace. Soon Shelby heard their heart-appalling cries; To learn the cause, he stood in his surprise; They comeâthey close him roundâin dust they fall, And loud for mercy, in their tears they call: âProtectâO saveâdefend us in our life! Save us, in mercy, from the reeking knife! If thou art callous to our weeping eyes, O melt thy bosom to our infants' cries! Our hands were never rais'd against thy power; O saveâand blessings on thy head will shower! âIf nothingânothing will suffice save bloodâ Or if our flesh must be to thee as food! We yield ourselves to deathâbut saveâO save Our tender offspring from unsightly grave! O let our babes in innocence remain! Defend our virgins from pollution's stain!â While thus, with bitterness, they plead their suit, The veteran's tongue was chain'd in wonder mute; A tear involuntary bath'd his eye; His every word is burden'd with a sigh: âWhence did this frenzy in your brains arise? These are mad fictionsânot realities; We know no other than to guard the fair; Hence, dry your tears, and calm this wild despair.â They thought him false: âO wherefore do you strive, With proffer'd hopes a keener pang to give? The ice-cold grave turns every blood-vein chill; You speak of peace more sharp our life to kill! Why do you mock us with delusive dreams? Thy joy is blood to gush away in streams! âAnd did not Proctor in his grief express, That ye did murder with a greediness! That you, Kentuckians, from the parent's knees, The smiling infant like the savage seize, And dash its throbbing brains upon the hearth; The spotless virgin of her beauty scath, Then, search her breast with fireââ âGood heaven! refrain,â Suppress this burning frenzy of the brain! âO Slander! what art thou? thou second death! Thy look is hell!âcorruption is thy breath! The tyger kills to fatten on his prey, His hunger pleads to suck his blood away; The dark assassin, at the midnight hour, Stabs to the heart to gain a rival's power; The highway robber, with a felon's stealth, Murders his brother to acquire his wealth; But Slanderâvenom'd Slander! when that we Compare a tyger to a form like thee; Or the assassin, at the midnight bed; Or robber, plundering of the grey-hair'd dead, Bright is their aspectâyeaâas heaven above Outmeasures earth, where these fell monsters move! âOur spotless name is all; the rest may fly, As gossamer, that floats on vacancy; Come, starving Poverty! come, cruel Death! We'll smile upon you in your grinning teeth! But Slander,âthou dost eat upon our heart With viper's tooth, which poisons every part! âProctor, O whyâ âMy thoughts of him no more, Or, for these scalding tears, will fall big drops of gore! âDeluded matrons! to your homes return; Nor for yourselves or tender offspring mourn; You've been deceiv'd by Slander's scorpion tongue; Kentuckians seek no foe, but tyrant wrong; They to the weak are a protecting shield, For which their bosoms holy luxuries yield.â The veteran spoke. A something from his eye Darted conviction with solemnity; It cast away their fear, which like a cloud, Had dark'd their peace, and rais'd their anguish loud: Tears gush in floodsâbut not the tears of wo; A tide of joy streams down their cheeks of snow! Thus Clark, the western Hannibal,âalone Had left his wifeâupon the Wabash gone To beat the savage back to Erie's shore, Who late had steep'd their cruel hands in gore: Whilst widow'd thusâlo, Rumour fills her ear, That in death's ambush, all her soul held dear Was mix'd with earth! Her cries of grief ascend, Mourning her children's father and her friend; Raising to pitying heaven her weeping eye, Whom does it glance upon?âher husband nigh! Louder she screams! In giddy transport blest, She leaps convulsive on his throbbing breast! So when the matrons were to hope restor'd, Thus swell'd their voicesâthus their tear-drops pour'd. They ravish'd kisses to their offspring give, As though they late had died, but now they live! They turn reluctant with a side-long gaze, And as they turn, they utter Shelby's praise: âMay righteous heaven pour gladness on his soul, Till the last pulse of ebbing life shall roll!â Thus, as they pass'd, they hail'd him on the way, And gave a kneeling blessing to the day. Meantime the troops had their pavilions spread, And each had wrapp'd him in his fleecy bed; Spent with their march in hurrying to the flood, Serene they slumber in a weary mood. No busy voices round the camp are heard; No soundâsave footsteps of the passing guard; The stars are silent on their thrones of gold, While the new moon, most lovely to behold, Reveals her crescent, where the shades of night And day's last glimmerings placidly unite; Her silver horns appear like angel's wings, That poise his feet, when through the air he flings His flight precipitate. Descending slow, Her downward horn is seen no longer now; 'Tis hid behind a rockâthe other bright, Lingers above and shows upon the sight Like something that is heaven! Fast it recedesâ It fadesâ'tis gone!âbut yet, a holy beam Reveals the spot where it hath kiss'd the stream. But not to sleep the veteran is inclin'd; Anxious command drives slumber from his mind; He, with Adair, whose locks were touch'd with snow, Mounts and proceeds along th' encampment slow, To teach his office to the soldier young, And probe his heart, if beats his valour strong. They hear the voice of sentinelâand light; (The horses with Adair.) âWho comes in night?â âFriend!â Shelby answers. âGive the countersign!â âTecumseh.â âPass in silence on the line.â âPray have you nothing to remove this damp? Keen cuts the air and makes my sinews cramp.â âYes, well am I supplied. My arms retain, Till I provide a remedy from pain, Which Proctor left behind. My wish is all, That I could meet him single with a ball. âYou pause!ânone richer e'er was broach'd. You start!â Freely I give. 'Twill animate your heart.â âToo free indeed. Unarm'd, your strength have I! Were all like thee, how soon our name would die! Were I in character some artful foe, I'd every purpose of the army know!â Thus Shelby: Thus the guard: âStranger, I fear, That you art something more than you appear! But from my heart, far distant was design To lay expos'd a section of the line; I hope no whisper of the deed you'll bear To Johnson, Shelby, Harrison, Adair.â The chief in answer with reproof began: âNothing I doubt your virtue as a man; But what is courage, or a well-meant heart, If we, at option, from the rules depart? Defeat will follow and a death surprise; The best intentions never will suffice; The mind must not be dreaming. Take your arms, And be all watchful of the night alarms; 'Twould the best feelings of the General wound, To hear a sentry was from duty found; To him, or them, I nothing shall recite, For well I know you'll prove yourself in fight.â Back he withdrew to where the steeds were tied; They mountâand onward on their purpose ride. Soon they approach, where aged Whitley stands, His locks made gray by fighting savage bands; With ear awakeâeyes lifted to the brow; Along the line he paces to and fro. Hearing but indistinct the horses' tread; He harks attentiveâturns his hoary head; And, at the instant, sudden to his ear, He lifts his hand to catch the sound more clear,â His foremost finger bent to wed the thumb, The others spread and rais'd:âIn this position dumb, Listening he stands. He hails them: âWho comes there? What noise of tramping hoofs disturbs the air?â âFriend!â was the answer. âShelby's friend or foe, Dismount, that I the circumstance may know!â âEqual to Shelby's character is mine, Hence, mounted, I'll advance and give the sign.â Whitley rejoins: âI, reckless of your gradeâ Down without pausing, or your life shall fade!â The general then: âI'm chief upon the land; From me alone the field receives command; Yea, Shelby, I am he. No more enquire; On I shall pass, and do as I desire.â âStand! I command! I'm ignorant of a man!â As Whitley spoke, he op'd the snapping pan: âFor you, I pause notâgeneral or a saint, Down from your charger, or your life shall faint! I'm general here!ânor dare insult my post, Or to yon cloud in heaven shall fly your ghost!â Shelby believing 'twas the lock he sprung, His steed dismounted, ere he'd still'd his tongueâ And gave the watchwordâ âWhitley!âis it you? My old companion in the service true! It wakes the richest feelings of my breast, To meet an ancient warrior of the West; It brings to memory those daysâno more, When back we drove the savage from the shore; And where we join'd our labours in the fight, Till dying Ferguson renounc'd the Height. King's Mountain. âMy friend, farewell! And should we meet no more, But die with honour on the hostile shore, We'll join our hands in friendship's holy press; Our snowy locks proclaim our failing race.â Thus he: And Whitley thus: âI came to die! But all I askâI wish, is victory; I came prepar'd to sleep upon the field; A sleep in which my soul with smiles will yield; Though now it is my joy to find my death, Yet first their blood shall flow upon the heath! âMy aged wife, I leave upon thy care, For death is mine, if there be death in war!â âMy friend, fear not protection of thy wife, Should'st thou for Freedom render up thy life, And I exempted from a soldier's bed To sleep in glory with the honour'd dead. I'll never urge thee from the field of arms, For well I know the battle has its charms To rouse the soul, when tyrants aim the blow To crush our liberties in dust below. âBut look, the evening star hath sunk in heavenâ Once more farewell! To fame shalt thou be given.â With melting hearts their trembling hands they joinâ Tears moist their cheeks, in which the star-beams shine. Adair beheld their meeting, and partook Of every sentiment the veterans spoke; Bidding adieu to Whitley on the plainâ Speechless they mount, their stations to regain, Where soon they lose life's pleasure and its pain. CANTO XIX. BATTLE OF THE THAMES. ARGUMENT. The Army march in pursuit of the Enemy .... Proctor and Tecumseh .... The Battle .... An Episode between Johnson and his brother .... Proctor rescued from his Pursuers .... The Interment at the River Raisin. The scene is laid at Malden, on the Thames, and at the River Raisin .... The time is eleven days. The stars in beauty travelling to the west, Soon wear away the dewy hours of rest; The lids of morning waken and behold The jewell'd earthâwith curtains fring'd with gold. The early drummers as the day appears, Join'd with the fife, give musick to the spheres; The warriors hear the animating beat, And, rous'd from slumber, bound upon their feet; Shoulder to shoulder solid they unite, To hear the words that Shelby would recite, Who forth advanc'd, and these instructions gave: âKentuckians! chivalrous, in battle brave! To search the foe we've overcome the flood; Now testify the richness of your blood; They fled at rumour whispering your advance; Yeaâere they caught the anger of your glance: But we must press them with unwearied might, Or they'll outstrip us and avoid the fight; To climb the craggy steep of fame is hard, But what of earth can equal the reward? Their fears will be as wings to their retreat; Hence we, as eagles, must pursue with heat; Privations, labour, must our souls despise, Or never we our names eternalize. âJohnson, lead forth your iron-bosom'd men: The horse count off, and march in files of ten. Wood, in the centre, thy artillery form, Whose organ notes will tune the thunder storm. Chyle, Henry, Trotter, Symral, King, Desha. The thick-set infantry in line display.â The drums strike life with spirit-giving sound; With nerves in thrill the troops forsake the ground; Beating with rapid feet the dusty road, They move like darkness borne upon a cloud. The time the royals with the savage fled, The guilt of Proctor fill'd his soul with dread: Oft as he deign'd to cast a look behind, The freedom flag was imaged in his mind. Thus a fell outlaw on a wizard plain, With hand made crimson in a victim slain, Flies with distraction to escape the cord, While prosecuting Justice writes the word Deep on his heart! He stops and lifts his hands, Dropping with murder!âdumb, he harkening stands To catch the passing soundâthe waving wood Dampens his soul, and curdles up his blood; A ruin'd tree rent by the whirlwind's breath, He apprehends a minister of death, Ready to seize and stifle in his life, Or search his being with the lifted knife; He wheelsâbut other objects fright his eyes; From his own shadow he despairing flies. So Proctor's deeds of blood distract his brain; His reeling mind whirls dizzy on the plain. Their fleet's surrender round the land had rung, Which rous'd the Albions, with ambition stung; Crimson battalions, like red moving flames, By Evans rul'd, collected on the Thames; Baubee, an equal host, and Warburton, Who, oft in Europe had the battle won. These, in collection at Moravia, meet, Proctor to rescue from a swift defeat. Them, at a distance, Proctor through the wood Beheldâwhich all his energies subdu'd. He wheel'd to push his flightâso false his eyes, His friends deceiv'd him for his enemies. Tecumseh mark'd him in a scowling mood, And flew, and met, and check'd him on the road, And thus begun: âWhy backward on the flight? And will you dare with single arm the fight? This path, Kentucky holds! Brother, you look, As though by all your relatives forsook; See what a crimson cloud comes moving nigh! These are our friends! The enemy shall die!â Proctor in gaze stood fix'dâand wildly then: âNot possible yon standards royal men! Not from this compass do advance our host! Is Shelby here? I'm sacrific'dâI'm lost! Our strength is weakness!âbid the whole retire! They'll seize, they'll bind, they'll torture me with fire!â He scarce had finish'd, when he wheel'd to flyâ But lo, Tecumseh check'd him with an eye Frowning, a meteor gleaming on the heath, An omen, pregnant with approaching death: âYou snake of poison tooth! but dare depart, And me with rifle will explode your heart! Tecumseh long has kept his soul in chain,â But now, his vengeance, tempt it not again! You plunder, talk, and fire, and scalps, and blood, But when big danger come, you never stood; I joy'd, when Croghan smote you down to deathâ What evil spirit brought to you your breath? You man of wind, of noisy tongue in talk; Indian, less speechâbut straight in duty walk; You captives murder for the pleasure's sake; By you Cawataw burnt them at the stake! âIn war, Tecumseh is the sign of death! But smother'd never he an infant's breath; But you rejoice to take the suckling's life; You spare no stooping mother, nor the wife! Tecumseh's joy is with the warriors strong, But not the aged with the whistling tongue. âYou bad at heart: Now bad man fears to die; That pales your cheek at sight of enemy; A good man heeds not deathâhe standâhe fightâ Big sound of thunder war his soul delight; The Spirit Great his soul with lightning warms; And should he fail, he mounts above the storms!â He ceas'd. But still the frowning of his look, Aw'd Proctor's soul, more than deep words he spoke; His colour went and cameânow whiteânow redâ And now he chok'd and stammer'd with his dread; If on the chief he deign'd to lift an eye, Cow'ring it fell, his virtues tower'd so high: So have I seen a guilty slave appear, When stern his master search'd his faults severe,â Sweating cold dew, he'd raise and fall his sight, Sinking,âjoints trembling,âhating of the light. Oft he assay'd to answerâbut in vain; His tongue was cramp'd as fasten'd with a chain. At length the thought quick flash'd upon his mind, To give the boon his monarch had design'd, At Malden by a messenger express'd; But then the tumult drove it from his breast. He hands a sash with cunning work inwrought, And thus proceeded to make calm his thought: âTecumseh, mighty chief!âgriev'd I confess, That, lost in many caresâmy wrong no less, Than to withhold this royal gift from you; Receiv'd at Malden at the time we flew; This will create thee second of the field, For thou hast prov'd incapable to yield; Accept the boonâ'tis special from the King, A lofty honour on thy name to bring.â Thus he. Tecumseh then: âWhite man be so, He hides his darkness with deceiving show; Not Indian thus: when crossing stars turn back, We show our feelings by the sorrowing black; But when they pour success upon our head, We paint the pleasure by the gladdening red. âNow, as respect design'd me by the King, I give him thanksâbut not accept the thing; To me no useâin nature's wildness born; My father taught such gifts to treat with scorn, And thus to me he talk: ââTecumseh, son, Behold our tribe in white man folly run; I feel the weight of years, and soon my tongue Will teach no more to guide your footsteps young; Open your earsâand now, what I declare, Do thou, my son, in deep remembrance bear. ââBeware the white manâoily in his talk, 'Tis sweeten'd poisonânever straight his walk; Beware you shun religion that he teach; One way he act, another way he preach; To day he tell intemperance burn within, And on the morrow urge you to the sin! Beware your dealings with the white man blood; He give you trinkets for substantial good. Great Spirit gave to Indian, buffaloe, bear; The deer, and elkâso bounteous was His care; Because we treated these, his gifts, with scorn, His anger grew, and we are left to mourn. ââUse no deceitâexcept to snare thy foe; And when he yields, him sparing mercy show; Despise a coward as a graceless man; Despatch him with the axeâhe'll shame thy clan. ââThy mother cherish with attentions kind; To you her feeble years are now resign'd; Think of her labour in the sun for thee, And how she lap'd you on her tender knee; Do thou with equal love her care repay; Be thou her staff in her declining day. ââTecumseh, son, thy father's words regard, And thou wilt meet in happy fields reward. ââWish not for ageâ'tis fill'd with grief and pain; Be wisdom thine, while thou shalt here remain, Let that be short or longâthen fear thou not, Thy name will be in future years forgot; The mind still flourishes when all is lost; The rest soon melts away like autumn's early frost.â âThis was my father's teaching. Shall I now Forget his voice? to silken net-work bow? No: deep within my heart his voice shall rest; Lock'd in the centre of Tecumseh's breast. âNever you'll gain my friendship with your gauze; To blast the enemy in thunder wars Is feasting to my soul! Comeâfear no more! Display thy warriorsâwake the musick roar Of earthquake battle loud!âFrom Thames' steep bank Marshall your linesâthe stream will guard their flank; The Prophet and Tekelah shall combine, And from yon marsh will I extend the line; The Thames will fence your left, the swamp my right,â Thus will we stand and swallow up the fight!â Proctor beheld the favour of the ground, And, on his stirrups rising, look'd profound With aspect grave, which fools for wisdom take; And thus, as though from partial dreaming, spake: âTecumseh, heaven hath kept thee for this hour, To crown with triumph my defeated power! The past appears a momentary dream, Or the faint glimmer of a watery beam, That looks through murky clouds when the moon pale Wades in thick mistâand all the star lights fail; But now my mental energies are clear, As noonday lightâno spot upon the sphere; To thee, the praise I giveâ'tis only thou That could have bent my mind against the foe; Marshall thy powers according to thy plan; Here will we plant ourselvesâfight man to man. Thy Albion brothers on the left will stand, And guard with death the passage of the land! âDistrust me not. I feel sensations new, Fanning my breast, their standards to subdue; In the late field my bosom fail'd of breath, But now I feel to fight the fight of death! We shall, we will prevail! My nerves are strong, To roll in thunder with the strife along!â Vaunting he spoke. Tecumseh bent his head, In moody silence, doubting what he said; But yet he felt a soothing in his breast, That he his soul indignant had express'd. Strong with the strength which in his bosom stirr'd, He join'd his warriorsârous'd them at a word: âNow, face we death! Each choose his sheltering oak; Give ground no more. Let every heart be rock!â As when the herald of infernal name, Calls forth hell-labourers to the work of flame, They hear the roughness of the clarion sound, And rise in darkening multitudes around. So when Tecumseh gave the signal word, His clans arose with features stain'd abhorr'd. With veteran judgment he displays the line, To slay the ranks where horse and foot combine; A morass deep, gives safety to his right; Himself in centre standsâdeath's messenger in fight. Proctor had join'd his regal forces now,â To whom, like eloquence, his accents flow: âChambers, Warburton, Evans, Reynolds, all Who war for royal titles, hear the call! Marshal for battle! On the left extreme, Level the cannon to elance the flame! Than this, no farther shall the foe advance; We'll meet them here with death's inheritance! In coward flight no longer will we fly; Our strength augmented, they must yield or die; Here will we stand and drive Kentucky hence; Won is the field, when Albion makes defence! Pale fear cast backward to the waning moon; This day we shine in glory with the sun! Conquer but now, Columbia is our own; Behold, we win an empire for the Crown! Let every Briton flame with fire his breast; We fight, we conquer, and we rule the West!â The royals heard and wonder'd at the sound, And thought his soul was touch'd with the profound; They felt a gladness in their bosoms new, For now they judg'd their leader would be true. Thus at the Falls that break Ohio's flood, Deep stagnant waters had for ages stood, Breeding all monstrous animals of earth; Toads, scorpions, lizards,âmillions at a birth; Green putrefaction with pestiferous breath, Exhal'd from rotten lungs cadaverous death;â Behold, Industry comes with nervous hand And drains the marshes from th' infected land; The toads, the scorpions, and the lizards die, And Putrefaction gasps in agony; Exuberant Health comes blushing in the breeze; The grape, the lily, and the loveliest trees Leap into life! The City Louisville. smiles serene, To mark the prospect of the living scene; New life, new joy, her every fibre thrills; A laughing happiness her bosom fills. So Proctor's voice reanimates to life His downcast legions to maintain the strife; The columns presently in line display, And scowl defiance at the gathering fray. Meanwhile, full breasted, the Kentuckians drive To crush the swarming of the savage hive; Swift as their enemies before them fly, They leave behind their every luxury, From which the brave subsist abundantly. Thus for three days ambitious they pursue The foeâto have with arms an interview; But on the fourth,âas from meridian height, The sun his gold diffus'd, the Johnsons light On the same ground where Albion spent the night, The half-extinguish'd watch-fires smouldering by, Give truthful notice of their foemen nigh. Shelby, the Johnsons, Harrison, Adair; Croghan the youthâWhitley with hoary hair; Barry, Crittendenâornaments of earth; Symral and Thompsonâvaliant from their birth, Stand in a group, advanc'd upon the ground, And thus to Johnson, Shelby's words resound: âBehold, hath come the harvest day of fame! Thrust in thy sickleâreap a glorious name! âPly the quick spurâdash bounding up the stream; Search you the foe, ere farther we advance; Trace his position with a wary glance; Observe him wellâif still upon the flight, Or marshall'd on the plain to brave the fight.â Fleet at the summons Johnson plied the goad, Dash'd along rapid, and devour'd the road; As burns an arrow from an archer strong, So eager flew the chief and shot along; His plume, white tipt with red, stream'd far behind, And danc'd redundant on the liquid wind. He curb'd his charger on commanding ground, And jealous mark'd the gather'd host around, Joy'd at the sight, his ardent soul took fire; His every heart-string shiver'd with desire. Thus when a mariner for three long years, Had plough'd the eastern and the western spheres; At length, home bound, he makes the headland nearâ But lo, a mist beclouds the objects dear; At noon, before the gale it scattering flies, And Boston opens, sweet as Paradise! His soul is floating in a tide of bliss, Transported, tearful with his happiness. So Johnson felt the passion of delight, To mark the allies ready for the fight. His bosom calm'd,âhe kenn'd with warrior skill Their posture of defenceâwheel'dâmade the hill, Where stood the chiefs:âThey listen to his voice: âThe hour hath come, that bids us to rejoice! Our anxious thoughts and weary toils are o'er; The foe stands planted on yon field before! His posture of defence is artful chose; Their left extreme is where the river flows; A row of thunders their deep ranks support, Ready with flame our energies to thwart; Tecumseh's strength is partially conceal'd By the thick growth that overshades the field; He holds the right. A morass close at hand, Will make it vain to flank upon his band; Hence, we must meet them open on the field, And arm to arm our ready falchions wield. âI to thy judgment would with deference plead, The charging onset of the war to lead.â Him, Shelby answers: âTo proceed with horse Against train'd infantry, a novel course; Yet will the charge succeedâ'twill strike with awe. By its bold daring and decide the war.â To Johnson, Harrison, âBrave man, move forth: Known is thy valour and thy patriot worth; Proud in the senate hath thy tongue proclaim'd The nation's honour, which the foe defam'd; Thine every thought is to thy country given; Now lift thy glory to the light of heaven; We shall be near thee to sustain thy path, And glean the field with desolating wrath. âThy brother, rich in fame, will lead the right Against the Albions in the shock of fight; Whilst thou wilt thunder on Tecumseh's line, And prove the virtue of thy origin; The infantry will charge with steel in hand, When once with blood we mark thy lifted brand. âDivide thy warriors for the bold assay; The aged chief will nerve them for the fray.â The horse stand column'd. Shelby's accents flow Warm from the heart and kindle on his brow: âLet one emotion animate the whole; Hot chafe the bosomârouse the smother'd soul; Long have we toil'd the enemy to meet; Endur'd the winter's coldâthe summer's heat; These toils are now no moreâwe charge them home; A day to live in future years hath come! âDo not strange tremblings in your bosoms ply, Kindling your souls with immortality? YeaâI behold in every eye the fire, Glancing the language of the heart's desire! Joy thrills the cords of life to mark the blaze! Strong in the strength of Liberty, up-raise The Eagle high in airâher wing to heaven Expand! Fame,âfame eternal to your deeds be given! âLet him, who dreads the shockâwith timid heart, Back from the honour of the day depart; Never I'll stand beside a coward slave; None shall advance who fear to find a grave! âNoneânone retire! Each heart is ribb'd with steel; Unconquerable band! What joys I feel! I seem in bloom of lifeâmy years made young! A flood of transport drowns my ravish'd tongue! Let your advance be deathâa chain of fire; In wrath, let blood-stain'd enemies expire! âBut when they kneel, then, soften'd be as down; Let mercy raise the subjects of the crown; 'Tis heaven's first virtue ever to forgive, Hence, let the vanquish'd gentleness receive. âAnd should the fight give Proctor to your hand, Let not his blood be seen upon the land; Death is a boon too rich for him to have; The field of battle is the warrior's grave; No: half his crimes by such a death would fade; To fall with heroes would exalt his shade. âSilent move forth, till they elance the blaze; Thenâthen the passions to a frenzy raise; And, while the Eagle screams along the sky, Charge on with deathâcharge on with chivalry!â His language gave a quickening to each part, And seem'd to wind like lightning round the heart! The columns, silent their positions take, And list to hear the sounding bugles break The signal to advance. Still as the breath, That faintly languishes at sleep of death, The elements remainâas though they felt The time at hand, when sun and stars would melt; No leaf the forest stirs. Lo, Johnson's sword Proclaims the sign more forcible than word; At once, the bugles answer with a sound, That seems to shake the bosom of the ground; It strikes the breathless army on the rear, Like Judgment trumpet when the dead appear! The mounted warriors, at the signal note, Move forth like clouds, when slow on air they float; Each heart strong-beating with the pulse of life, To reach the foe and mingle in the strife; With eye undamp'd, they mark upon the heath, The ranks display'd to melt them down to death; Fix'd in their purpose ere they force the charge, The enemy should stream his fire at large. Now when the Albions heard the bugles sound, Proctor with Elliot vanish'd from the ground, But Reynolds, valiant thus: âFear not, nor move! Now the heart's daring of the English prove; And let them come! With hearts and weapons strong, We'll sweep their columns in the dust along; Think of our Alfred's, Henry's, Marlborough's blood, Who thrice their strength in battle have withstood! And shall we give and falsify their name! Blush at the thought,âshould heaven be fill'd with flame! âThe foe approaches! mark! Waken your ire! Mix steel with steel, and melting fire with fire!â Through every breast his words as lightning run; A hurrying death elanc'd from every gun, Solid at once!âthe motion was so fleet, The blaze scorch'd heaven, unbroken in a sheet! Their steels they 'tempt to fixânot time have they, The Johnsons charge, and fierce begin the fray. Loud as the crash of tempest-shiver'd oaks; As dashing waters boil o'er pointed rocks; As ocean's billows breaking on the shore; As pealing thunders round the welkin roar; Such the vast tumultâsuch the deafening jar, As dash the columns in the charge of war; The horses' feet deep echo to the skies; Thick clouds of dust in volumes vast arise; Half hid, half seen, the maddening ranks appear; Now their plumes show like live things in the sphere, The rest is all obscureâsave now and then, The heads reveal themselves of tallest men, Like the moon wading through the mist of clouds, She shines a moment, then her glimmering shrouds: Onâon they boundâas lightnings fiery sweep, In blood the bosom of the earth to steep: As when black whirlwinds from th' equator driven, Split the dark clouds and dash them loose through heaven; Bend the weak birchesârend the knotted oak, And strike the wilderness with besom stroke; Sheets of black dust eclipse the solar ray; The mountains groanâearth reels beneath their sway; Ruin flies wasting on red wings of fire; The cavern monsters howlingly retire. The Johnsons thus, like whirlwinds, thunder on; Thus break their linesâthus tramp the Britons down. From front the columns having strew'd the dead: âBattalions! wheel and rush their rear!â They said; The patriots turnâbut ere they ply the heel, The Albions crouch beneath the weight of steel! But lo, Tecumseh in his pride withstands The furious onset of the charging bands; Rice, Chambers, Thompson, Whitley, Church, unite The centre columns of the foe to smite; Tekelah, Prophetâwith their strength oppose The Freedom warriorsâblows resound on blows. Tecumseh's voice the rage of battle pours, Maddening the fight, which sounds to Erie's shores: âWarriors! draw blood till every heart be dry! Like rocks which break the thunderbolts on high, Stand in the strife! As lightning blasts the heath, So strike and blast the enemy with death!â The savage heard, and rais'd th' infernal scream; Sharp glancing fires from flint-struck rifles stream; Supported thus, Tecumseh awful moves, Like some dark ghost in lightning-kindled groves; As grass before the blade in summer dies, So on the field sink friends and enemies. In different parts are different actions seen, Equal the bravest of the brave of men: Now Whitley and Tekelah close with rage, And fierce in hand with bloody axe engage. As when two panthers meet upon the heath, And mix in combat with their claws and teeth; Nor this nor that give groundâin desperate mood, They gash, and gashâtheir bodies smear'd with blood. Thus Whitley and the brawny savage close; And thus their blood from sudden gashes flows; At length, the hoary veteran smites his brow! Tekelah whirlsâthen sudden drops below; Blood from his nostrils in a foaming flow. Whitley now glancing at Tecumseh's form, Dark with the horrors of the rising storm, Rushes to quench the brand that flam'd the war; His white locks waving in the troubled air; He standsâhe draws the rifle to his eye; The sparkles catch the dustâthe ruins fly To search him through the heart! but by quick wheel, At the brief instant that the hammer'd steel Fretted with fireâthe ball Tecumseh shunn'd; Yet blood is seen to trickle on the ground; Deep through his shoulder is the gory wound; Fierce he recoils upon his aged foe, And rapid hurls the never-failing blow; The coated axe, thick-matted o'er with hairs, Wide through his convoluted bowels tears! As sinks an aged elm before the blast, So fell the warrior and expir'd his last. Tecumseh forth, when he the sage had kill'd, Dash'd like a tempest o'er the burning field, Kindling the strife! A savage host rush on To scalp his hoary locks to please the Throne! Prophet, impetuous, desperate in his might, Leads on the wild-men to the murderous rite; Thompson dismounts his charger at a bound, And meets the howling savage on the ground; His bold battalion render him support To guard the body with a proud effort; As two dark rolling streams from adverse hills, Supplied with water from a thousand rills, Mingle with madness in the vale below; So Thompson's warriors mingle with the foe. As round they wield the axe, blood marks its edge; Man crowds on man in battle's dreadful wedge! At times the slaughter thins the stifling press, But that augments, not makes the carnage less,â By giving freedom to their arms and breath, The axes drive more sure the stroke of death. At length, the Prophet in the dust is laid, Floating in blood by Thompson's reeking blade; The savages give way:âthe patriots seize Whitley the prizeâand, from the slaughter, raise And bear him forth to those upon the rear, Who place the veteran on his martial bier; A bier more honour'd than the bed of state, Where kings are laid to make their burial great. As Thompson's band with Whitley's corse withdrew, Johnson gave madness to the battle new: âKentuckians! elevate the soul on high, As in the fields of ancient chivalry! Ariseâspare not! Fight on with courage bold, Like Clark and Estill in the days of old, With Logan by their side! Smite down the foe; Let savage blood be seen at every blow!â He put his valour forth;âand like a star Blazing through heaven, he shone in thickest war. His banded strength pursued! The battle roars, Like outrag'd ocean breaking on the shores; Like showering hail, sharp whistling, whiz the lead, And every volley magnifies the dead; The noise disturbs the elements around; The gushing blood makes drunk the thirsty ground. As when from mountain tops small streams descend, Swelling and maddening as their channels bend; The brooks augment to rivers as they flow, Which roar, and foam, and flood the vales below. Like this, the conflict swells. The Thames turns red, The field around with darkness overspread. Johnson engag'd, beholds Tecumseh nigh; They stopâand roll at each a lowering eye; As two dark clouds frown opposite in wrath, Muttering deep thunders to th' affrighted earth, So frown they dismal with a tightening breath; Threatening each other with a look of death! Behold, Tecumsehârapid to his face, His rifle bearsâto end the Johnson race; Slaughter the foremost of Kentucky's sons, Within whose veins a tide of honour runs; He blinds the vision of his leftâhis right Burns like the polar star in wintry night, And fastens on the head. The ruins fly, And tear his hip and lacerate his thigh; One strikes his hand, that holds the guiding rein. But saves the chief from falling with the slain, For, with unerring line it aim'd his breast, But the wrist bones obliqu'd it to the west; Yet unappall'd, the hero in his right Retain'd with iron grasp his weapon tight; So lost in action, he forgot his pain, Though in fast drops his blood bedew'd the plain. Tecumseh rushesârais'd his axe to throw The whirling hatchet at his wounded foe; Johnson presents the hidden deathâand aims; Touches the spring! searching of life, it flamesâ Beneath his lifted arm, swift flies the shot, And opes the fountain of his bosom hot; The sixth rib fracturesâheart through centre rentâ The passion'd blood spouts hissing from the vent; With feeble force Tecumseh throws the axe; His arm gives wayâhis strength dissolves like wax; He reelsâhe sinks to earthâhe gaspsâhe dies; His soul ascends its native paradise. So once, in years gone by, the mammoth trod Kentucky's wiles, as some superior god; A bolt of thunder from a cloud in heaven, Against the iron of his skull was driven; He shook it off! Another flew amain; Like to the first he glanc'd it on the plain, Which in its progress spread a ruin round, The rocks before it shatter'd to the ground; At length, another from the magazine Came, lightning-drove, to search his heart within; Between his ribs of brass it rent its way, And, through his shoulder, forc'd itself to day; Staggering, he fell! Earth groan'd beneath the blow, As though a mountain had its overthrow. Thus fell the great Tecumseh in his might,â And with him fell the spirit of the fight. Soon, Johnson's charger, wounded through his life By balls that shower'd like April rain in strife, Sinks, fainting to the earth, deep stain'd with gore; And all the glory of his strength is o'er. He paws the blood-soak'd heath with dying throes, Eyeing his master whom he yet still knows; And, for a time, forgets his sweating pains, To see him pale and weltering on the plains; The fire that burnt within his eye subsides; Each inspiration bathes his milk-white sides In crimson foamâbut when his breath expires, The vital fountain in his chest retires; Faint and more faint, his mouth is on the plain; At times he lifts it upâbut now, alas, in vain! He turns upon his sideâhe gasps for breath; He chillsâhe shivers in the pangs of death! Harrison, Shelby, with reserve press'd forth, As Johnson, bleeding, sunk upon the earth. But lo, the Fiend in counterfeited form Came sweeping forward like a rushing storm; His borrow'd lineaments of savage race Deep trench'd the wrinkles in his haggard face; Beneath his iron brows his eyeballs roll'd, Whose glance the hell within his bosom told; An angry sparkle shot from every hair, Which stood erect, and quiver'd in the air. A half-tam'd tyger bore him in his path, And thus to Shelby he began in wrath: âMy name is Burning Mountain! Stay thy host, Or by slow fire thy aged limbs shall roast! Yeaâdare to pass to give thy warriors aid, Thy splinter'd body shall on coals be laid!â He ended scowling with tempestuous look, And o'er the veteran's head his axe he shook. âDark form! my soul was never known to dread A burning Mountain or a ghost of dead! Give placeâretire to where th' unrighteous dwell, Or quick I'll search the secret of thy hell!â No more, with patience could the Tyrant bear; He rais'd his axe with a convulsive air To smite him in his strength! But lo, his life Was by Fredonia shielded in the strife; Invisible, his sword she touch'd its edge, That with the Spirit he might combat wage. âAnd durst thou wake the tempest of my soul? Monster! feel deathâor bow to my control!â Astonishment! the counterfeit he thrust; And made him sink submissive in the dust; The hallow'd touch of the celestial hand, Made the steel burn like seven-times heated brand! Th' infernal blood, black issu'd from the wound, And hiss'd, and smok'd, and boil'd upon the ground; Thick from his nostrils pour'd a cloud of night, In which he roll'd his form, and vanish'd from the sight. The tyger which he rode assum'd its form; It shrunk to earth a reptile scorpion worm, And wound like crooked lightning o'er the plain; But soon it shelter'd 'neath the savage slain. None, by the tumult in their mind, conceiv'd The sage had more than mortal acts achiev'd. The veteran leads th' impatient army forth; The wild-men scatter broken to the north; The elder Johnson thunders on their rear, And hurls them slaughter in their path severe. While this transpir'd, the younger Johnson lay, Bleeding by slow degrees his life away; His eye mov'd languid, and his lips turn'd pale, While in his ear, Death sung his doleful tale. Thompson and Barry, Crittenden and Payne, Haste to remove him, weltering on the plain; On a soft litter with an easy tread, They bear him backward from the scene of dead; On downy pallet, in pavilion large, To anxious surgeons they resign their charge, Who forth with ready hands the blood suppress, And sprinkle water in his marble face; But all of no availâhis eyelids close Half downâand half the fading eye expose. The soldiers sighing past the tent would stray, And cast a look and wish themselves away; Yet would they stand and linger round the brave, Whispering to heaven, his valiant life to save; Fast by his couch his weeping nephews stood, And press'd his cheek, and wip'd the oozing blood. Meantime the sadness through the army spread, Their favourite chief was number'd with the dead! His conquering brother having sheath'd his blade, Crimson with slaughter in the battle made, Now catches the report that loads the gale; Various, but icy, the pathetick tale. He seeks the tent, and finds him in his blood; He stands in silence with his soul subdu'd, Pressing his hand! His tears his heart betray To see his brother languishing away. At length, the utterance of his tongue returns, Whilst with affection all his bosom yearns: âWake, O my brother!âlisten to my voice! One breathing whisper will my heart rejoice! O, but one farewell from thy lips be given, And I'll resign thee, if I must, to heaven.â The hero waken'd at the well-known tongue, And with soft press his hand with trembling wrung: Lifted the curtains of his eye serene, And cheer'd his brother with a smiling mein; A bless'd sensation shot along his soul, As boreal light that quickens round the pole. Thus a fond mother, with despairing wo, Marks in her infant each convulsive throe, Sickening to death. Deep, solemn, silent, pale, She counts the pulses as they ebbing fail; Lo, while she stands thus rack'd with her despair, Her dying infant smiles a healthful air! Her heart is ravish'd at the joyous sight; Her every fibre shivers with delight. So when he press'd his brother's hand and smil'd, Each anxious bosom with its transport thrill'd; They lean to hear his voiceâyet still they fear, That they intrusive will disturb him near: âThy voice, my brother, hath new wak'd my life, And call'd it back from death's conflicting strife; But O, how rich the luxury to die, When circled in the arms of Victory! I scarce can thank theeâyet thou know'st my heart; I meant not so: till Death shall hurl the dart, With resignation, happy will I live, And to my country every effort give; For her I bleedâto her devote each day, Till heaven shall lap this mortal dust in clay.â Here, he half fainted on his brother's breast, But found a pillow there as soft as angel's rest. The meantime Suggett with a chosen band, Seeking for Proctor, bounded o'er the land; With stimulating spur they urg'd their way, Swift as strong eagles searching for their prey. Chill'd at his heart, oft Proctor bent his eyes Back on his path:âAnd now he pale descries The horsemen wind the hill! âThe steeds urge on! I feel them at my vitals! lostâundone! Iâwhere? what manner?âwhere can I conceal? In yonder cavern!âthousand deaths I feel!â By this, the Fiend, that sways the world accurst, Had clos'd his wound receiv'd by mortal thrust, And, through the cloud, observ'd the grievous state Of his begotten, shivering with his fate. Behold, as Proctor op'd his chariot door, He stoop'd his wingsâand on his shoulders bore His darling child! Without the change of death, Glad, he conducts him to the realms beneath! Suggett observ'd the movements of the Fiend, And saw him seize and bear from earth his friend; None but the holy man the Form beheld; Such was the virtue to his soul reveal'd, The others thought he'd vanish'd in the cave, His forfeit life from their pursuit to save. âGoâspeed thy way to darkness with thy sire! Hell's gulf is yawning with its jaws of fire! Great is my joy to see thee grappled fast, By him, the monarch of the scorching blast.â As the last word the reverend warrior spoke, The head of Proctor was conceal'd in smoke. Till setting sun, the dead the patriots urn, Ready at day triumphant to return; They dream of glowing visions through the night, And wake, and form their marching files at light; The numerous captives in the centre stand; A measur'd league they stretch along the land; The brazen guns, that Hull to Brock resign'd, Are, with due honours, to the front assign'd. Arms, martial instruments, luxurious spoils, Fall to the brave to recompense their toils. And now, their march for Sandwich they pursue; On the sixth day, the lake expands in view; The fleet, a passage to Detroit afford, Where to the fort the cannon are restor'd; This doneâfor Raisin they advance their way; And reach the fatal ground at eve of second day. Alas, the scene that opens on the sight! The fields around with untomb'd bones are white! From every eye the drops of grief descend; Some mourn a brotherâsome a bosom friend; The son, his hoary sire,âthe sire, his son, Adown whose cheeks the trickling sorrows run; Murderers, their captives now! but yet no look, No vengeance threat'ning of their lives is spoke! But to their cruel, worse than savage foe, A kind indulgence the Kentuckians show; Yeaâwere they brothers, friends, instead of men, Who late had acted such a death-cold scene, They could no more, than bounteous they receiv'd From hands whose souls unrighteous they had griev'd. At length, with Freedom form'd upon his right, And those that murder'dâopposite in sight, Shelby begins: âThe brave are ever great, Through every scene in high or low estate; I've seen you suffer by a merc'less foe, Without a wrinkle knitted on your brow; I've seen you rush to war, sublime in soul, And fire, and carnage through the battle roll; I've seen you bind their woundsâtheir feelings calm, When they have knelt beneath your victor arm; My heart was gladden'd to behold these scenes, In future bards to wake immortal strains; Though these are acts which bright as heaven appear, Yet they with present deeds can ne'er compare. âHere, on my right, I see my children slain, Whose bones are whiten'd by the sun and rain; Here, on my left, the murderers captive stand, Presented, generous, with kind Friendship's hand! âHistorick Muse! thy lengthen'd scroll display! Bring the past deeds of nations into day! Ken every syllableâline, word, and page, From Time's first dawning to the present age; Where can you point the page, the line, the word, That will with this exalted deed accord? Noneânone appears! A virtue new must rise; Pen it, O Muse!âand waft it to the skies! âMy heart is full. Sad office now remains; The bones to gather, scatter'd o'er the plains, And shroud them in the dust,âthen, with a tear, Pay the last tribute to the warrior's bier.â Slow move the patriots with a weeping eye, Anxious their brothers, fathers, to descry; But O how vain! Distinctive marks are lost; Save the blank frame, all moulder'd into dust! How must this scene subdue the heart of pride! Let not the young the aged nerve deride: Here lies, O thoughtless youth!âa form once fair; A glowing heart that never felt despair; His lambent eye did once on beauty rove; Pierc'd her soft bosom with the looks of love; These charms are fledâsad change! Now all remains Are whiten'd bones stretch'd naked on the plains! The grief-pale mourners place them in the earth, While the soul's fountain from their eyes streams forth; With clay-cold dust, they shroud them from the view. And sigh with aching hearts, their long, and last adieu! Slow, homeward as they move,âlo! from a cloud, Fredonia's voice is heard, more sweet that loud: âMourn not, nor weepâtheir souls to joys are given; Mourn not, nor weepâthere's glorious rest in heaven!â CANTO XX. INVASION OF CANADA AT QUEENSTOWN. ARGUMENT. About the same period that Proctor invested Fort Meigs, Brown took command at Sacket's Harbour .... Van Rensselaer is detached to Lewistown, who, on his arrival, prepares for a Descent upon Queenstown .... A Traitor .... The Storming of the Heights. The scene is laid at Sacket's Harbour, Lewistown, Fort George, and Queenstown .... The time is ten days. During the time that Shelby in the West His arms employ'd to tame the savage breast, Around the borders of Ontario far The deafening turbulence of clamorous war Rag'd like the breaking of the clouds in heaven, When the pent thunders to the earth are driven. Now, as the Muse the plans of warfare sung In Freedom's capitol, her theme but young, Brown was selected by the President To place his name among the eminent, Whose deeds stand blazon'd on immortal scroll, Who broke from kings the sceptre of control. The State of Penn was honour'd with his birth; Born near the spot of Trenton's hallow'd earth; Often he trac'd where Washington had trod, Which caus'd a sacred thrilling of his blood. In his first years, the village school he taught; Nor higher dignity of fame he sought Than aid the budding of the mind to bloom, And the dark chambers of the soul illume; No sound of mustering war disturb'd his ear, Though even then the Albion character Was deep encrimson'd with the damning crime, Impressment, never to be lost in time: But yet the Nation thought to check the sin, Without the storm of battle to begin; Hence, to enlarge his mind, he bent his views And strove the light of science to infuse In the warm bosom of his country's youth, And make their minds ennobled with the truth; Knowing, what heaven eternally design'd, That Freedom ever should exist with mind. Thus did his years glide on, till rumour'd war Spread with hoarse accent through the land afar; He snatch'd his swordâunsheath'd it to the light, Determin'd never, till his country's right Should be establish'd, its keen edge to blind, Unless, in arms, he honour'd death should find. The fashion of his limbs bespeaks the man, Solid in strengthâexact to nature's plan; His ample bosom holds a heart that bounds, When dread the bugle the mad charge resounds; Yet, when the flag of peace is seen to float, Its pulses calmâit loves the gentle note That vibrates round the mellow scenes at home, Where songs of sweetness echo to the loom. His voice is gifted with expression strong; And when he speaks, deep judgment clothes his tongue; His look is somewhat sternâhis eye is hid, Partial, by the contraction of the lid; But view it well, and obvious you'll remark Beneath the frown, an unextinguish'd spark Of vital burning:âThus the orb of gold, When overspread with intervening fold, Is not discern'd, beheld with careless eye, Though proud it holds its station in the sky; But mark it well, we then observe its form Majestick, grand, though struggling with the storm. When Brown by Madison was cloth'd with power To guide the battle in the fearful hour, He, to the Harbour Sacket's Harbour. at Ontario's wave, Advanc'dâwhere chiefs, with native valour brave, Before him had assembled:âScott, a name Never to perish, from Virginia came; Gaines was his brother by parental State; And each, in daring, had a soul innate; The next was Ripleyâchild of woody Maine, Who, midst of carnage, kept his mind in chain; Wool, Morris, Christie, Forsythe, Wadsworth, Pike; And none, in virtue, earth sustains their like; The venerable Swift, and Rensselaer, Frosted with age, amid the group appear. The Muse her page with numbers might enlarge, To whom the bugle, giving out the charge, Was musick to their earsâbut these above, The first in brilliancy of honour move. So thus in autumn, when serene the sky, The stars show splendid in the galaxy; Some, more magnificent with light appear, But all with glory decorate the sphere; Not otherwise these names conspicuous stand, Rank'd with the foremost of the patriot band; And each will shine an unextinguish'd star, Till years are lost in rolling ages far. Now as the mountains, cloth'd in foliage green, Are lin'd with golden lightâthe chiefs convene At Brown's pavilion, his commands to hear; And while he speaks, each holds attentive ear: âWarriors! 'tis ours the nation's strength to wield, And curb the royal arms upon the field; On us, our country bends an anxious eye, To stand the bulwark of her Liberty. âWhile Shelby holds the circle of the west, Presenting to the foe an iron breast, Down from Niagara to the smooth Champlain, We, from invasion, must the soil maintain, And jealous guard it from a foeman's tread, Walling the land with steel-crown'd bayonets dread. âThis purpose to accomplish, Rensselaer, Proceed to Lewistown, with fire to sear The centre of their hearts in battle shock, Should they from you withhold the Queenstown rock. âA line of infantry awaits you there, Anxious to bring their energies to bear Against the Heights: From Massachusetts, late, They march to aid us to defend the state Against oppression. Strong sustains the bandâ Brother to him, who governs in the land; At times, I doubt, they'll move like patriots on, Such sore divisions pull their valour down; But you will weigh with judgment, when you find The strength or weakness that pervades their mind. âNow, while Macdonough shall defend Champlain, The different passes Macomb will maintain; Pike in the centre will abide with me, T' invade, or guard against the enemy; The fleet of Chauncey, with his seamen hale, Will soon be ready on the lake to sail. âLet every eye be open on the foe, That when we strike, their glittering standards bow; This to fulfil, forth to your place repair, And prove by action what of souls ye are.â The warriors heard his purposes, and wheel'd, And rank'd their ready squadrons on the field; The aged Rensselaer turnsâmarches west; Though small his number, iron is their breast; Eighteen times fifty constitute his line, To pass the flood and do the bold design; With Strong's battalions nothing more he'll need, Should Strong himself prove valiant in the deed. Scott, Christie, Gansevoort, Randolph, Morris, Lent; Mulaney, Vallance, Wadsworthâeminent; Bloom, Armstrong, Kearney, Malcolm, Fenwick, Carr, Ogilvie, Sampsons,âcharacters of war; And Rensselaer, Col. Van Rensselaer. whose throbbing heart beat full; MacChesney, Gibson, Stannahan, and Wool; And Mead, and Baker, Towson, Lawrence, brave, To lead to battle o'er Niagara's wave. On the tenth day, the sun descending clear, They enter'd Lewistown with Rensselaer Whiten'd with age, their banners floating proud, The drums shrill beating their advancement loud. During one moon, ere they approach'd the site, With six battalions, Strong, in armour bright, Had gain'd the villageâwaiting Rensselaer, To pass Niagaraâmocking at the fear; (Strong had reported of his strength to Brown, By Dexter, rising to a fair renown.) Brief, when the echo of the drums was done, To Rensselaer, he anxiously begun: âThough late, you give us joy. Since here, one moon Has wax'd and wan'd in heaven, expecting soon To see thy train approach. Impatiently We've gaz'd, and gaz'd, to view thy banners fly, Gladdening the breeze. My warriors long to press, And crush the foe for Raisin's savageness; By patient words, in part I've cool'd their flameâ But, at the instant thy battalions came, They seem'd like wolves, when greedy in their ire To fasten on their preyâeyes glancing fire, They long to pass the wave, and climb the height Of yonder battlements in shock of fight; Oft as they mark the banner o'er the stream, The burning of their eye is meteorous gleam; Not soothing words will smother their desire; Their heartsâeach veinâtheir very blood is fire To leap upon the foe with bayonetâswordâ Make but the signâdeath melts them at the word!â While this description of his ranks he gave, The general listen'd with an aspect grave: âSoon shall their murmurings cease, for lack of toilâ At morrow's dawn we tread the hostile soil! Without delay, the warriors I'll inform My swift intention to begin the storm.â This answer said, they pass'd along the field, While with each other they a converse held. Marshall'd in columns, both divisions stood; Squadrons of Strongâand those who trac'd the flood Of the Ontario lake. The volunteers, When they the chief beheld of former years, Brandish'd their weapons in the glancing light, And boisterous shouted: âLead us to the Height! Our souls are on the wing to stem the flood, And climb yon battlements and spill their blood!â When had the echo ceas'dâthe veteran then: âDeliberate valour marks the deeds of men; Mistake me not, to smother aught of fire, Or curb a warrior of his bold desire; But then the lion never chafes with heat; Conscious, he feels the battle-day to meet; Frequent it happens, words reduce the mind; They waste the substanceâshadows stay behind. âSo as the wine in the alembick boils, Or the sweet spices, rich with odorous oils; The more it foams, the weaker is its strength; The dregs are all remaining there at length, While the choice odours and the spirits rare, Are spent and scatter'd in the vacant air. âThus when our words without reflection rise, They waste the power to quail our enemies. âBut far from me to dampen, or deride A heart that beats to line. Let each confide Firm in his native strength, when the dark hour Of fiery tumult shall around him lower. âTime's hurrying wings the moments rapid move To test your virtueâpatriotism prove; At noon of night, in pointed steel arise, To pass the rock-ribb'd stream, and, by surprise, Ascend yon eagle Heights, and storm the foe, And strike the Blood-Cross from the welkin low.â The volunteers rejoin'd with voices shrill: âYon Heights are ours, or our best blood shall spill!â But those, who late from Brown's position came, Stood silent in their strength:âA smother'd flame Was pent within their heart: an untam'd look, From lowering eyes, more loud than shoutings spoke. The storm proclaim'd, each to his station hies To be prepar'd to wrestle for the prize. Arnold the infamous, for treason done, In Strong's battalions had a graceless son, Who bore the nation's banner for his rank; His soul corrupt, as though he'd copious drank At the dire fountain of corruption's stream; Frequent his father visited his dream. To riot in loose pleasure was his zeal, Reckless of virtue or the publick weal; With mind debauch'd with vice, he apprehends The action just, that satisfies his ends, Whatever are the meansâcan ne'er retain, To practise virtue was the noblest gain. From his first years he lov'd the spendthrift's part, Which, like an adder, wound about his heart, Pouring its deadly poison through his frame; Setting the passion of his soul in flame. Beneath the rocks, he sought deep solitude, And thus the workings of his brain pursu'd: âAnd is it not insufferable, that I Longer should bear this weight of poverty? Scarce does my grade a beggar's part afford; An insult to my character and sword; And must I ever bear this loathsome thrall? The very thought my bosom turns to gall! Who, that has pride, indignant would not feel, To be compell'd, like slave in chains to kneel To him, whom chance more dignified has made, Whilst all my deeds are buried in the shade? âAm not I mock'd, by reason that my name Is that of Arnold?âwhere in me is blame For what my father did? I love my soil, And would most cheerful for its freedom toil: And do they thus the son of Hull depress? Noâhe receives an honourable caress! âNever my taste was made for savage food, But such as earth supplies of luxuries good; None that have educated thoughts can live On the small means, that officers receive; Then, how above the multitude, can I Erect my browâmaintain my dignity? âMy dignity! This comes of royal name; But equal Freedom sinks the soul to shame; Away the thought. One life have I to spend, And that in pleasure to the last shall end. âNow who would be so abject in his plan, As with the vulgar to be honest man? None, but a mind that wallows in the mire, Grovelling with swine, and knows of nothing higher. âI on the honey of the rose will live, If earth have means the luxury to give. âBut here, I'm cramp'd and mock'd with a supportâ Nothing that will with dignity consort; I must improve itâthis degrading post Will hardly satisfy one pleasure's cost; The most inferior of the regal lines More in the character of honour shines, Acquires more wealthâyea, more luxurious lives, Than Brownâor any of his rank receives! âWhy do I pause the purpose to pursue? Honour and wealth are open to my view! I'll pass the streamâthe enemy inform The swift design of Rensselaer to storm. â'Twill never doâI must renounce the planâ The world in scorn contemns a treacherous man. âI must these views restrainâlive mean, obscure; Loathsome the thoughtâI'll never it endure; Peace, conscience! peace!âthy meditations hold! Think of the pleasures purchas'd with the gold! âWhy stand I pausing in my purpose slow? Wealth shall be mineâI'll seek it of the foe!â This said, with silent feet he made the shore, And skimm'd the waters in a light skiff o'er; The Fiend was near, and aided him to pass, Smoothing the waters to a stream of glass. âWho interrupts the night?â The watch-guard cried; âFriend!â soft the traitor in his turn replied; âA friend who comes to warn thee of a blow, Prepar'd to smite thee with an overthrow! Guide me to Vincent, who commands the hold, That I the brewing danger may unfold.â The parley ended,âhim the sentry led To Vincent, late retiring to his bed; His troops for many hours had lost the world, Its cares perplexing, in oblivion hurl'd, Save Myers, his second officer to lead, And Manners, valiant in the day of need. Vincent abrupt: âYour character and name?â âMy name is Arnold: from thy foe I came; I am of Arnoldânoted for the boldâ But not to thee his courage need be told: I hold the rank to wave a standard there; But now to you important things I bear.â He broach'd his hell. Vincent in haste rejoins: âI'm fix'd attentionâopen their designs! Yesâin your lineaments, I well descry Your father's features and his very eye; His heart was steel and fire. I knew him well; I'm proud you visit us. The tidings tell.â Thus he. Then Arnold brief: âThe plan is laid, At sign of day, thy fortress to invade.â âI comprehend you not! Said you at light, That those of Lewistown would storm the Height? It is not truthânot possible indeed, They'll boat the flood and to these rocks proceed! âI pray you speak what numbers they can form, That I may guard against the coming storm.â âThe volunteers of Strong are thousands two; But much I doubt their courage will be true; With Rensselaer, nine hundred warriors came; But death alone can overwhelm their name.â âThey'll never dare the deed! They'll see their faultâ They'll never dare to venture the assault; They 'tempt it, and they die.âYeaâsudden death Will seize their heart, and strangle them beneath! Ere that a barge will ever touch the land, Their bodies will be wash'd upon the strand, Or feed the hungry monsters of the wave; The man that dares attempt, will find a grave! âMy strength is equal to defend me now, Against the utmost darings of the foe; But wisdom plans the future worst to guard, Triumphal honours yields a proud reward. âManners, bound forthâlet lightning be thy speed; A moment now, no value can exceed; Fly to the Chippewaâbid Calloose there, With all his fighting men to this repair; And Myers, 'tis yours with rapidness to hie Down to fort Georgeâthe same your embassy; There, you'll salute the royal-knighted Brock, And make it known, they war upon the Rock; Urgent solicit him without delay T' advance, if possible, ere twilight day.â His chiefs, unanswering, his commands obey. Turning to Arnold, hasty he began: âAs recompense that you reveal'd the plan, A royal captain, I create you now; Thou art the shield that warded off the blow; Secure I thought myself against assault, But thou hast taught me to correct my fault.â The traitor's bosom beat with prospects high; But Vincent wheeling, barr'd him from reply; From couch to couch, with spirit in his breast, He call'd his warriors to forget their rest: âBritons! awake! or never think to rise! The foe is bent to rush us in surprise! Shake off this mocking death! Each part make sure Against assault. Your royalty secure; The brass, that mock the thunder, charge with balls! Ariseâawake! imperious duty calls! Each bosom be a rock, nor danger fear, And death shall meet them for a messenger!â They heardâhalf dreaming from their slumbers broke, A wild emotion glaring every look. In Boston thus, at solemn time of night, No object stirring save the meteor's flight, Lo, through her proud Exchangeâa gorgeous pile Of splendid halls, where numbers dream'd the while Of ships return'd with India's merchandise; Of wealth abundant, from the lottery prize; Or rapture glancing from the eye of love; A cry of fire came thundering from above! Tumult aboundingâdreamers dash'd from bed, Awak'd with horror and convuls'd with dread! So sprang the Albions from their slumberings forth, To hear a tempest gathering into birth. They drive with hurrying pulse and labouring breath In the brass mouths the canisters of death; Soon stand the engines planted with a frown, Th' invading barges in the surf to drown, Should any dare the streamâwhilst every soul Impatient waits to hear the signal roll. Till this, the waxing Moon with ivory horns Had wash'd with silver light the hills and lawns; But now she sinks behind the mountain's height, And leaves the world embrac'd in smoothing night. Inconstant Moon! farewell!âO, why so coyâ To shine so sweet in heaven and swell with joy My gazing soulâand then, withdraw thy beam, And mock my hope with a delusive dream! Farewell!âI cast thee from my bosom far, And place my heart on some unchanging Star; At times, I thought thee wedded to my breast; When lo, thou hid'st thy beauty in the west! Sad, with a tear I bid thy charms adieu, To seek some lov'd one with affection true. Come to my heart, thou Star, whose hallow'd ray Hath never dwindled since creation's day! Maid of North! How sweet the lovely Seven, In mystick dance, swim round thy beams in heaven! My love is rapture. Thou hast mark'd mine eye Pour on thy beauty, center'd in the sky! Oft hath my soul gaz'd,âworshipp'd thee alone, Till my lips seem'd to kiss thee on thy throne! The MoonâI name her notâfor thou art mine, To make my tongue speak wonderous things divine! Where have I bent my thoughts? O tell me where? In heavenâon earth?âI'm lost in transports rare! Descend, O Muse, nor think that thou canst live With deities, that light eternal give! Descend to earth, and leave this wildness highâ Man is thy themeâfleshâashesâdustâmortality. At hour of midnight, strengthen'd in their mind, Columbians rise to do the work design'd; The chief impatient for the bold assay, Passes the lines, that nothing might delay To navigate the stream. With souls awake, To brace their blood, of viands they partake; Their keen-edg'd appetite makes sweet the taste, And not with idle forms the moments waste. These brief instructions from the veteran come, âIn column form without the tell-tale drum, Whose babbling echo would the foe alarm, And place him ready with defensive arm.â Th' attentive warriors, with unsounding feet, Move on the ground with spirit-motion fleet; In close-wedg'd column on the field they stand, Fix'd in attention to receive command To stem Niagara's torrent. Rensselaer Approaches and gives musick to their ear: âWarriors!âbehold the shades of waning night Fly off apace, to bring the welcome light To loom the path, which leads to the empriseâ When, steel in hand, we grapple for the prize! âSon of my brother, Col. Van Rensselaer. thou wilt lead the van, Tyger in battle, though in heart a man: Float thy battalions in advancement o'er, Six hundred strong, and land upon the shore. Christie, display the same of equal worth, And, in the charge, their gallantry put forth; Ascend the Heights with bayonets, lead, a shower; Beat down the Cross, and let the Eagle tower. âScott, play the batteries. Baker, Towson, brave, Supply him with your strength to guard the wave, Should the foe, jealous, notice our design, And strive with brass to sweep away the line. âEver a soldier for the worst should guard; For every evil be his mind prepar'd, And then, no accident will cause surprise, Should fires made hot with sudden whirlwinds rise.â Scarce this had echo'd from his aged tongue, When Dexter, hurrying forthâ(an aid to Strong) With rapid accents thus: âSage Rensselaer! Lo, our intentions to the foe, I fear, Are openly reveal'd! Of our brigade, Arnold the younger, to his ear has laid The manner of attack! Void is his postâ Sad I forebode his character is lost! Oft have I heard him at his means deride; His whole campaign a day scarce satisfied.â Strong strengthen'd his report: âNo doubt remains, But he hath left us for corrupting gains; To slippery pleasures was the traitor given, Whose votaries oft to desperate acts are driven.â While this was utter'd, every heart was dumb; The damping news made every nerve feel numb; 'Twas like a blast, which, rising from the sand Of burning desert, passes o'er the land, Scorching the future harvest in its bloom, Fill'd with contagion to supply the tomb; The peasant marks his hopes and labours lost; And through his blood perceives a creeping frost. The younger Rensselaer at length express'd The native passion stirring in his breast: âMy father's brotherâchief of ancient fame, Never this treachery my heart shall tame; And let the traitor our intentions show; In open day I'll strike upon the foe! Yeaâshould their thunders jar the wall'd-up shore, And death flash round me in a blazing shower, I'll move upon the Rock! Instant, at dawn, I'll pass the stream and lead the hope forlorn!â His voice breath'd valourâChristie breath'd the same, Should all the battlements be wrapp'd in flame. The general, after pausing: âGrief and joy Mix in my breast, and make a strange alloy; My heart beats languid with a sinking pain, That lurking treason should the army stain; But with divinity my feelings rise, To see your souls the open war despise. âSoldiers! to arms! Behold the morning star Burns in the east, prelusive of the war! Move to the purpose! Without sound embark, While yet the ebon night is shadowy dark; Soon mantling twilight with her sober gray Will line the hills and drive the shades away.â Down the rough steep the columns silent turn, While sparks of glory in their bosoms burn; Warm'd by that fire, with confidence they move To pass Niagara, their bayonets prove; Christie leads next to Rensselaer the way; The boats are laden'd as the stars decay; Scott mans with thunder-men the battery strong, Ready to speak with War's rebellowing tongue. Meantime the Albions, rous'd upon the Height, Waited in silence to reveal their might; And as day glimmer'd in the orient sky, They mark'd the patriots on the waters nigh! âLevel the engines! See th' approaching foe! Outnoise Niagara, and bring them low! Let one deep blast appal them in their pride; Let volum'd flames consume them on the tide!â Vincent commanded with impetuous look; The cannon answer'dâheavy clouds of smoke Mix'd with blue fire, roll forth. The deafening roar Cradles the Height! while flames in whirlwinds pour Sweeping the craggy clifts. The valiant Scott Peals his artillery with thunder note. As when two mountains in the northern sea, As though excited with an enmity, Explode like Ãtna from their wombs beneath, Each casting forth the violence of death, The burning lavaârocks made red with heat Seem as they mix though heaven they'd desolate; Contending thunders mingle in the fray, Like wreck of nature at the judgment day; Something like this explodes from either shore; The dread convulsion stills Niagara's roar. The tumult rous'd the Fiend from his abode; His form he partial rais'd above the flood; His head, like summit of a mountain vast; His arms in hugeness like an admiral mast; Deep in the centre of his forehead high, With horrid glare looks out his ghostly eye, Round as the moon, and broad, as when through blood She travels to the east with murder'd brood Of spectres in her trainâriding on fire, And, as they wheel, flash, darken, and retire; His cavern mouth yawns horrible and drear, Deep as the grave, in which his teeth appear Like pointed rocksâand, fearful as they gnash, Sparkles of hell in circles round them flash. Unseen by mortal, thus the Fiend arose, Intent the Freedom passage to oppose; He comes in wrath the barges to devour, While round his brows the clouds of thunder lower. But lo, Fredonia's ever-watchful eye Beheld the Fiend from the ethereal sky; Swift she descended from the diamond sphere, And touch'd his boiling breast with sacred spear, Then, rose upon the wing! At once he shrinksâ With earthquake groan beneath the wave he sinks; Convuls'd with pain, he spouts the waters high, Which, for a moment, leaves the channel dry; Now crazy whirlpools, stirring from beneath, Show him in torment with the pang of death. Meantime the barges, laden with the brave, Are borne like leaves of autumn on the wave; Now, to the summit of the Height they reach, Then, down they dash upon the rocky beach; In drunken eddies whirlingly they rise Full in the flame of all their enemies! Christie endeavour'd to inspire his men; Alas, despair in every face was seen; Lo, in the act to animate his band, Dissever'd sinks his soul-exciting hand; Instant a cutting lead, from rifle sent, Burnt in the bosom of the youthful Lent! Shivering he falls a fading lily pale, Yet smiles his lip as his last pulses fail. In giddy whirlwinds, back, without an oar, Christie is dash'd and broken on the shore. But Rensselaer, Ogilvie's barge beside, And Wool, and Morris on the waters ride; Their leader prov'd his virtue: âBend the oars, And overcome the rage, and make the shores! Let fire unquenchable, in bosoms blaze; Your hearts, your souls, your every fibre, raise To cast defiance back upon the flood; Dash to the beach, and drench the Heights in blood!â Thus Rensselaer. Behold, an envious lead, Glancing his bosom, lodg'd in Vallance' head! Recent the youth had left his mother's arms, Blooming in loveliness with nature's charms; Alas, fond parent!âmark thy bleeding son! He shivers in his death!âhis sands are run; His cheek has faded ere his prime begun! Widow'd and comfortless, O weep thy boy! He was thy morning songâthy evening joy. Indulge thy soul's deep sorrow on his bier, And if thou canst, O shed the softening tear; Grief dries the fountain up. But raise thine eyeâ Behold, he lives in immortality! As on from wave to wave the barges leap, He falls with splashing in the foaming deep; Reckless of deathâunmindful of the roar, The heroes dash upon the rocky shore, And Rensselaer, wielding his brand exclaims: âClimbâclimb the Heights and smother out the flames! Do, while there's life!ââ He fell upon the beach, Of wounds fresh made, that check'd him in his speech, Caus'd by four bullets driven from on highâ Two pass'd the muscles of his dexter thigh; One pierc'd his hip, another cleft his heel; But still his soul indignant, scorn'd to kneel; He raises on his sword, and thus proceeds: âMountâclimbârush forwardâdo immortal deeds!â He sunk and fainted with the loss of blood; But lo, his voice was to the mind as food To hungry tygers. Shouting high, they climb The rocky steep with spirits touch'd sublime: Vincent observes and rushes from his hold, And fills the defile with his veterans bold; In vain the patriots strive with steel to pass; They fall before the flames like summer grass Before the mowers sweeping down the field; Yet they, a time, the desperation held! At length, they slow behind the rocks retire, And shun the burning pestilence of fire. Wool from the defile leads a wounded youthâ Morris, renown'd for literature and truth, And all the virtues that adorn the heart; But ah, the roses from his cheeks depart; Above his collar bone, the rent is made; The ball glanc'd outward through his shoulder blade. He pours his dying voice; âMourn not my death; In Glory's lap I render up my breath! This bed of battle-earth yields softer rest, Than down that ever warm'd a cygnet's breast; But O, my friends, make vict'ry of my death, And I shall sleep with pleasure on the heath; My hovering spirit with a brightening smile, Will mark your banner waving on the hill! âAlas, what brings this dew upon mine eye? What cause subdues my bosom with a sigh? âO, is it thee!âthou worship of my soul, That wrings my heart, and makes these sorrows roll? Ah, now death-pains I feel! Our parting vowâ Methinks I hear it, whispering to me now, What thou with weeping said: ââO Edward, coldâ Cold as the rockâcold as the dark brown mould On which this brow will rest, wilt thou become, And all for which I live, will slumber in the tomb! In dream of nightâalasâI soon shall hear Thy hovering spirit whisper in mine ear, And tell me how thou died!ââ âThy quivering tongue, No more could speak thy soulâbut O, thine eye Shot through my heart the glance of agony! âFlyâO my Spirit! to her bosom flyâ Visit her dream, and tell her how I die; Speak of my fame in deathâof heaven above; And whisper sweet, that my last word wasâlove; O, that will chase delirium from her brain, Whilst cold I slumber with the honour'd slain.â This having whisper'd as to heaven in prayer; Her sacred image, as an angel fair, He drew from out his bosom: âO, that eye Contains the living beauty of the sky! That forehead crown'd with love,âthat neck of snow, Round which, like golden mist, thy ringlets flow! That cheek, to which the morning blush is given, Expressing rich, the workmanship of heaven! These dewy lips, like rose-buds born in May, Round which the graces in sweet dimples play; The breath, that issues from that hallow'd mouth, Is far more spicy than th' Arabian south; A seraph would delight to own these charms; How sweet to die within an angel's arms! âMy bosom fails of life. Cold on my brow I feel death's dampnessâcold as drops of snow! Thy matchless beauty hath delay'd his dartâ But now, my soul is fluttering at my heart! Yet, O, this luxury of a parting kiss, To death administers an holy bliss! âSweetâsweet in death! faint, fluttering, dizzy, darkâ Loveââstammer'd on his tongueâ Th' ethereal spark Forsook its gory tenement of clay, And flew, exulting, to the realms of day. Not otherwise the beams of heaven had shone Warm on a rose, till half its sweets were known; A passing virgin caught it in her eye, Impearl'd with dew, that glitter'd to the sky, She rudely seiz'd it for a nosegay rare; Its beauties fellâit wither'dâperish'd there. So Morris fled the region of the sun; Cut down and wither'd, ere the hour of noon. Instant the patriots saw the youth expire, It touch'd their bosoms with a quenchless fire To brave the worst of death! Ogilvie said, (Who now commanded) âMorris, hath he bled, Vain in the cause? His lastâhis dying breath WasââO my friends, make vict'ry of my death!â And is there none to quicken into flame, And mount the Heights and grasp the prize of fame?â âYes!â (Gansevoort answer'd,) âCautious on the right, I'll scale these rocksâascend the dizzy Height, And storm the fort! The foe shall be defiedâ I'll do the deed, with Randolph by my side. Rush you the charge, when we the signal shout, Then, with the bayonet, will we strike them out.â âSpoke like thyself! I'll watch th' important time,â The daring action will thy name sublime! Forth, when we hear your shouting on the Height, We'll clear yon pass, or pour our blood in fight.â Brief was Ogilvie's voice. The chosen few, Slow climbing up the cliffs, their art pursue. Like mountain goats, they scale the beetling rocks With bayonets pointing death! From springing locks The flints were loos'dâthat, on the steel alone They fix their faith to strike their foemen down. Behold, they gain the summit of the Height, And, shouting high the signal of the fight, Down, down they rush, like meteors from above, When brewing tempests round the mountains move! The Britons stand, like poplars on the heath, Shivering in storm,âto hear the shout of deathâ Ere scatter'd thought returns, icy, they feel, Full to the hilt, the cold, the pointed steel! Ogilvie rushes forward at the call, In proud defiance of the showering ball From those, who fill the defile!âon they hie, Like whirlwinds gathering from their infancy. The Albions breakâthen, rally to the fight, Like tygers darting on their prey at night. Ogilvie wounded, falls upon his kneeâ But still his voice alarms the eneny! Gansevoort applies to conquer'd brass the fires, And Vincent, reeling, with his strength retires. Down from the skies, the Albion Cross is drivenâ The Stars are floating on the breeze in heaven!

The Third Battle .... General Van Rensselaer endeavours to rouse the Patriotism of the Volunteers .... The Fourth Battle .... The Death of the Traitor .... The Ghost of Morris. The sceneâLewistown, Fort George, and Queenstown .... The time is about eight hours. Thou spirit-breathing powerâcelestial Muse! With thoughts sublime my weary mind infuseâ Thy stream of heavenâO pour it on my tongue, That I may sing a never-dying song! Inflame my bosom with thy holy fire, That I may reach the summit of desire. I sink,âI faint,âmy ardour cools awayâ My harp is looseâthe fretted strings decay. I feel my notes to languish as they flowâ The musick of my heart hath lost its former glow. The more I sing, more boundless seems my songâ New actions rise, that claim the poet's tongue. Hope's pictur'd dreams have kept my soul sereneâ For, long ere this, I fancied to have seen The Angel Peace, with spotless robes descend, Th' exhausting labours of my song to end: So once, in youth, while angling up the brook, And, as I pass'd, from flowers th' aroma shook, Big clouds arose in thunder from the westâ I heardâbut felt no terror in my breast. I sought a sheltering rock:âAt length was past The deep, dark clouds, slow moving on the blast. The sun with golden robes the landscape dress'd, Like groves and vales, where dwell th' immortals bless'd. The beauteous rainbow kiss'd the breathing hill, Which made sweet musick in each fibre thrill. I bounded o'er the brook with streaming eyes, And clomb the steep to grasp the heavenly prize;â But ah, ascended to the flower-wreath'd brow, Th' alluring charm was in the vale below! The more I strove to seize the painted arch, More swift it fled, delusive in its march: Thus like the rainbow passing o'er the plain, The more I sing, more lengthening seems my strain. Thy suppliant here by charity is fedâ At night, he slumbers 'neath a leaky shedâ Mock'd and revil'd by Slander's scorpion tongue, That he should vainly dare the epick song. The great frown on me, like a winter's chill, The infant bud of all my hopes to kill: But ah, of these I never will complain, Nor want of home, if thou wilt aid my strainâ Succour my strength, till I my theme shall closeâ My Country sav'd victorious from her foes; Then, on some happy spot I'll blithesome toil, And earn my bread in Freedom's teeming soil. Reckless could I the haughty slight endure Of scoffing pride, though miserably poorâ But O a friend, a bosom friend have I, Who, independent, should her wants supply. In blessing her, O bear me on the wing, Whilst I with hurried notes, the battle singâ 'Tis thou canst drive impatience from my breast, And make me, all a mortal can be, blest! By this, the Fiend, whose sceptre governs hell, Had spent his power;âsubsided was the swell: And, if the Muse be suffer'd to express In figure, greater actions by the less, As when a whale in Arctick ocean far, Beneath the beams of heaven's unalter'd star, Floats on the deep, watching the finny brood, Intent their sportive gambols to delude, And gorge his maw with satisfying food: Lo, in the act to leap upon his prey, A whale-man ready, with a bold assay His weapon plunges forth! He feels the blow, And hurries furious to the depths belowâ His anger burnsâthe craggy rocks he breaksâ They crash within his jawsâfoundation shakes Of ocean's bed. Now whirling from beneath, He foams to gain th' exhaustion of his breath, The troubled billows eddying mark his riseâ He comes! the waters dash upon the skies. Dizzy he wheels in agony of painâ Boiling the waves, he seeks the depths again, But finds no rest. He thunders to the shore, Reddening his progress with a stream of gore; He ploughs the gravelly bottom with his head, And forms new channels for the ocean's bedâ Tearing foundations of the sea away, And, with a deluge, spouts them into day. At length o'ercome with toilâand spent his blood, He yields to fate and dies upon the flood: So by the virtue of Fredonia's spear, The Fiend exhausted left the waters clear. Christie embarks and glides his warriors o'er, And joins with Wool upon the hostile shore. As Time proclaim'd the second watch of night, Myers on his charger, leaping like a flight, Enter'd the fortress, center'd on a rock, And made the danger manifest to Brock: âKnight of Detroit! behold, I come expressâ Queenstown, alarm'd, awaits with eagerness To greet you there. Look not in wondermentâ The eagle foe is planning a descent; A swift deserter, bearing Arnold's name, Hath open'd their design to storm with flame. Though Vincent's heart beats full, yet he desires That you would aid him to strike dead their fires.â âMy joy is with the valiant. Forth I'll go, And with Invincibles their flag subdue. Wallace, be ready to depart at day To bind your brow with laurels in the fray. Cadwell, hurl bombs upon Niagara's rock, That none from thence may aid them in the shock At Queenstown battlements. We must exceed Our efforts at Detroit, or lose the meed Of that triumphant day. With bosoms steel'd, Meet breast to breast, the enemy in fieldâ For Brown, nor Scott, nor Pike, nor Rensselaer, Have Hulls of souls to fly like coward deerâ Hence must our valour burn. But why this stay? Perhaps, they now are making the essayââ Rapid he marches by the wall'd-up streamâ The path discernible by coral beam, Which trembles from the starsâwhile, from the fort, Cadwell hurls thunderbolts with dire report At rock Niagaraâbut Freedom's son, The bold MacFreely, answers gun for gun. Brock gain'd a distant prospect of the Height, As the first sound gave notice of the fight. He urged his cohorts at the din of arms.â The shout of onsetâsudden flashâalarms, Kindled sublime the movements of his soul To join the battle and augment its roll. His efforts were in vain. The eagle rose, Ere he could bring his squadron to oppose. âWhat darkness! what eclipse! Warriors, behold, What sad disaster strikes the heart's blood cold! Our conquer'd cannon streams with hostile fire, From which, in loose array, our ranks retire! âNow prove Invincible in deed and name, And from the foe yon battlements reclaim; 'Tis not with him, who held Detroit, we fight, But men, who brave contention desperate. Your every nerve of warrior strength must rise, Or yield the standards to our enemies! Maintain what once ye were in Egypt,âthen Your names will rise magnificent with men! âAnd when yon banner ye shall overthrow, Administer sweet mercy to the foe. The deeds of Proctor darken with disgrace The Albion name beneath the savage race. âThese rocks we'll circle, till we gain their rear, Then, rushing violent with fire and spear, Scatter their ranks. Invincibles! advance! And do such deeds as rais'd the throne of France! Proveâprove the same,âyea, prove your bosoms flow With that to bring their starry banner low. He flam'd their passions with a bold desireâ Clad in deep scarlet, like a cloud of fire, Rear of the Heights, in solid band they move, Their strength and martial discipline to prove. And now, Ogilvie, bleeding on the heathâ But not dissolving in the mist of death,â To Wool, transfers the honour of commandâ (But three times sixty constitute the band.) A soul unshaken in the carnage storm, Smiling at danger in is wildest form. The instant Brock with icy arms appear'd, Wool, whom each soldier in his heart rever'd, Great in his daring thus: âYour bosoms swell, That to achieve, that shall in memory tell. Shrink not in thoughtâtheir numbers disregardâ Let glancing fires burn round the steel points hard! A charge, home-driven, will paralyze with awe, And check their rush of bayonets in the war. Yea, this their forward passion will appalâ We conquerors live, or in our glory fall!â Onward he led them in their strength of mind, Ere they could pause the dangerous work design'd. Lo, Brock himself was smitten to behold Th' unequal onset of the patriots bold. His legions froze to mark the daring band Sweep like a blast athwart a desert land, Horrid with steel!âHis soul return'd to Brockâ He flew from rank to rank to break the shock, Which made them think of death: âWhy stand with awe? Inflame the heart!âMove forward to the war! Plunge gory with the blade! Charge death for deathâ From wounds, that touch the vitals, let them breathe!â The Britons roll in wrath. The battle bleedsâ Wool's infant band achieve immortal deeds: They stand like blazing rocks in horrent mood, Slaking the thirst of their parch'd steels in blood. But Brock outnumbersâcircles them around, Like clouds, when charg'd with fire! At last, the ground Slow, by degrees, they yieldâth' o'erwhelming might Of Albion's power obtains the field of fight. But Wool, though broken, forms his ranks again, And checks the foe's progression on the plainâ Thrice, thrice he charges with the steel in handâ Thrice he recedes before the kingly band. At length, like quenchless fire, the conquering Brock Compels the patriots to the jutting rock, Which hangs suspended o'er Niagara floodâ Yet still they face the battle, bath'd in blood! One stepâone backward stepâthey fall the height, Where but to look, is horror to the sight! On either side, death circles them aroundâ But lo, they smile at death with lightnings crown'd: So since the morning of creation's birth, Fast chain'd with links of adamant to earth, The Isle, that separates Niagara's flood, Scowling defiance,âon the rock, hath stood. The floods descend with foaming in their might, To loose and plunge it headlong down the height. The flaming heavens unsparing thunders peal, Whilst the torn elements convulsions feel. But yet, the Island, at the edge of fate, Stands firm, unshaken 'gainst the pressing weight Of striving watersâmaddening to displace The solid fastenings from their rock-ribb'd base: Like this, Wool stands upon the beetling rock, Unmov'dâagainst the energies of Brock. But now,âso pressing th' unequal strife, A heartless soldier, to preserve his life, On bayonet's pointâin panick of despair, Displays a flag submissive in the air! Wool dwelt in all the field! Turning his eye, He mark'd the sign of pale submission fly Sad in the breeze! Indignant at the sight, He rush'd to save the yielding of the fight. He burnt with inward fire!âwith nervous hand, He snatch'd the flag, and ground it in the sand! âFor shame the coward deed! What, cringe and kneel And sue to be a captive? Ply the steel! What, yield and deign to live? Die first, and then 'Twill be sufficient time to yield like men! âSeeâfrom Niagara's stream, our warriors rush! Stand in your strength!âthe enemy we'll crush! But once, death's visitââ (Broken falls his arm!) âSmile at the blast, and make the heart's blood warm!â He clos'd, as Christie to his succour cameâ His hand in bloodâhis bosom in a flame: âBehold our brothers, press'd upon the Height! Hard gripe the steel, and forward to the fight! Let death be seen upon our path behindâ Onâon, ye brave, like heaven's o'erwhelming wind!â At Christie's order, they suppress'd the fire, And rush'd with bayonet, or to liveâexpire. The strength of Brock, invincible no more, Sinks on the field with bosoms spouting gore. They waverâreelâgive way, like clouds, when driven By wild tornadoes through the waste of heaven. Brock, with indignity, the field beheld, And turn'd, and pour'd his spirit on the field: âRoyals! how deep, indelible the shame! What, will ye vanish and renounce your fame? Where is your rich inheritance of pride? Wheel on the enemy!âthe storm abide! Chafe the heart's fountain-streamâand raise on high The Cross,âas in the days of chivalry! Yeaâand as late upon Iberia's plain, Ye drove the Gauls, like chaff in hurricane! And will you fly from half your numbers here? Blot out the word! Let deeds of death appear! My footsteps follow, and decide the field, With slaughter grip'd in hand! Think not to yield, But on and dash the fireââ His speech is o'erâ Rent are his vitals through. A gush of gore Stifles his lungsâhe falls,âhis charger flies; Mane loosen'd in the windâthe warrior dies! Thus Jove's immortal plant, in years of prime, Resists the power of northern blasts sublimeâ But lo, a woodman passing with his axe, Strikes to its heartâits strength becomes as wax; Its leafy honours wilter every blowâ And soon it crashes with its overthrow: Such was the fall of Brockâhis country's prideâ His aid, MacDonald, welters by his side. In future years, a monument will rise, Where on the Height he bleedsâto mate the skies. Heroes hereafter will delight to tell, How, in the ardour of the strife, he fell. Lov'd by his friendârespected by his foeâ In peace a father to the child of wo. The royals form'dâand, for the moment, stoodâ But when they saw their general pour his blood, They fled like scatter'd sheepâtheir shepherd slain By the grim monarch of the desert plain. Meantime at Lewistown, the troops display'd, And Rensselaer, (while Wool was fighting,) said: âScott, Wadsworth, Boyd, your warriors lead to field! There be their price of Liberty reveal'd. I forth shall give you succour. Strong, pause not To climb the Heightânever in fame forgot. On right of Wool will your division stand, And left of Scott, the lion of the land. âSee Wool and Christie in a cloud of fire! Hasten to aid them, or their souls expire!â Scott, Wadsworth, jealous for their fame, depart, A diamond valour burning on their heart. The troops, in files, proceed upon their rear; In a light pinnace follow'd Rensselaer. But, as they touch'd the beach, Brock pour'd his life, And Wool and Christie conquer'd in the strife. And now, the whole with Rensselaer unites, To whom his future purpose he recites: âBehold, our arms a second time have won! On fields more brilliant, never look'd the sun In all his paths through heaven! But, valiant men! We brief must guard against the changing scene Of wayward victory: Totten, draw with skill The lines of bulwark to defend the hill. Such deeds, unequall'd, will descend to fame, And give a brightning halo to our name.â With mathematick art, the engineer Designs the labourâeager, on his rear Hardy pi'neers invade the stubborn soilâ Mixing the songs of triumph with their toil. While thus upon the Heights their souls were fir'd, Deeds of dark name at Lewistown transpir'd: Discord, invisible, hurl'd round the camp, Pondering some circumstance, by which to cramp The arms of Liberty. At length, he chose This art,âto cast the nation into woes: His shape he fashions to a man of age, His visage deep, to counterfeit a sage. His eyebrows large o'ershade a solemn eye, That seems though musing on mortality. It oft on heaven in mockery would roll, As though he held religion in his soul; And by the pomp, which solemn he assumes, His features dark look poring on the tombs. When fashion'd thusâsedate, he pass'd along The eastern volunteers to visit Strong,â Who, when he saw him, disbeliev'd his eyes: âNot him, it cannot be, whom I surmise! My brother, is it he!â âWhen left you home? Hast thou to aid us with thy warriors come?â âWarriors! with murderers? no.â (The Fiend rejoin'd, Right glad his person had deceiv'd his mind) My soul is peaceâit shrinks from cruel warsâ Save those made righteous by a righteous cause. But never I 'gainst Britain could unsheath, For any causeâthe scimitar of deathâ It shocksâit bleeds my soulâthe Bulwark name, That guards our faith, as with a wall of flame Against the reprobate! A righteous God, For this rank war, dissolves the land in blood! âWith brother's love, you tender I conjure, To wash your hands and make your peace secure, While yet sweet grace remains. The damning sin, If you proceed, will crush thy soul within! âFor this sole purpose, distant have I rodeâ Yeaâto proclaim the terrors of a God, Who frowns upon this work! Pass not the waveâ But O, these lives vouchsafe in mercy save! Pass not the nation's line! beyond which mark 'Twill be to you as murder to embarkâ Yesâmurder, calm conceiv'dâyea, cold as frostâ You'll suffer hell for every soul that's lost! I see a deep damnation round thy brow! Infernal flames are kindling for you now! âAnd what if England have impress'd our menâ Should we for that in horrid arms be seen? Ah no, my brothersâtears and contrite prayers, Would show more christian than these ruffian wars. Yeaâbetter kneel in pious virtue meek, And when she strikes us, turn the other cheek. âO cease this strife of blood! My bosom yearns, That thou should'st fly the dreadful hell that burnsâ Thy friends will joy, as o'er the prodigal, When he return'd from husks of infidel.â While thus the counterfeit of Strong he show'd, At different parts, when high the accents flow'd, He touch'd the brother's hand: As when a snake, Coil'd in the matted grass, with eye awake, Watches with shining crest the labouring swain, As down he sweeps the beauty of the plainâ A favour'd time he leaps the leap of death! Deep in the peasant's heel he fangs his teeth! Quick the hot poison circles through his veinsâ The youth turns purple, gasping on the plains: So the Fiend's touch contaminates each part, Each nerveâhis brainâthe centre of his heart. âAlas, each circumstance I sadly mournâ For me, no longer shall thy bosom yearnâ Thy voice hath made me to my faith return. âMy squadrons now in waiting, I'll address, And on their minds the wickedness impress.â When hasty these acknowledgments were done, He thus, dissuading, to his troops begun: â'Tis time we'd learnt of wisdom: Ah, too long, We've leagu'd in slaughter for imaginary wrong! Behold the lineâthe limit of our shore! And he who wills to die, may pass it o'erâ But let him pause, ere he is reckless driven Headlong to death in violence of heaven! âWhat's a few mariners depriv'd of right, To be compar'd to this unrighteous fight? Declar'd to gratify our rulers vile, Who, at its carnage, raise a scoffing smile! Alas, unholy and unchristian men Have heap'd upon our heads this damning sin! A blow is struckâa fatal blow indeedâ Faith, Honour, Justice, and Religion bleed! O shame! by us the gauntlet should be hurl'd 'Gainst her, who fights the battles of the world! âKentucky cried for warâfor bloodâO think! Avenging God hath given her blood to drink! At Raisin's shore her very heart was riven, In awful justice, by an outrag'd heaven! And, at Miami, by express I've heard, That Dudley's band hath felt the savage sword! âReturn to reasonâcleanse your hands from bloodâ Lo, wrath eternal, should you pass the flood, Will smite with death! Hope not to be forgivenâ You'll fall like dead things with the curse of heaven!â As when the east damp rises from the seaâ Young Nature dancing in the robes of May,â And breathes a chilly vapour o'er the earth, Which kills the tender blossoms in their birth: So words of Strong laid ice upon the soulâ Disunion blights their character the whole! âWe'll choose the better part. Niagara's flood Never we'll pass to murder them in blood!â But Dexter, faithful mid the faithless, standsâ Indignant he beheld th' apostate bandsâ Forsook the traitor who the lines had stay'd, And these exertions like a patriot made: âWherefore is this? O, never you'll forsake Your brothers in the field! your honour break! Lost in wild passion, man doth often stray, Eccentrick, wandering, from the narrow way, Where Wisdom lights the path. Through Error's maze, Frequent our footsteps roveâbut if we raise Remitting eyesâand leave the part of youth, Our foibles fade before the beams of truth. âReturn. I'll lead you forth. Ascend yon Height,â And this deep darkness be dissolv'd in light! Prove that your souls have worthâand climb the wayâ And share the glories of this glorious day! âFile in the line of march! To faith returnâ Return and be redeem'dâyea, be your souls newborn!â The disaffected, ere his speech was said, Hiss'd him contemptuous, with a wagging head. But Dexter found within his breast support, And bore with cheek uncrimson'd the retort. The whole, by Discord were of strength subdu'dâ And Dexter left them in his solitude. Now, at the Heights, while they their toils pursu'd, Calloose, the savage, bursted from the wood! âWool, Wadsworth, Christie, Scott!â (thus Rensselaer, Urgent exclaim'd,) âHell's agency appear Like darkness crowding forth!âDisplayâlead on! And, with drawn falchions let their blood-streams run!â The warriors swift prepar'd them for the fight, Harness'd for battle to attest their mightâ To whom the veteran thus: âYour deeds this day Will live till life shall moulder to decay! Twice have ye fought, and twice the field acquir'd, And gave the soil the riches it desir'd! Now, once again you'll exercise the steel, And cause the savage in their blood to kneel. Harden your bosoms as with iron mailâ And when ye strike, let life be seen to fail!â This said, he wheel'd, and hasten'd to the shore To learn what circumstance delay'd the power Of Strong at Lewistown:âbe cleav'd the flood With Bloomâmade honour'd with the robes of blood. Meantime the savage, darkening in their might, With royals scatter'd on the field of fightâ Impetuous, onward at a signal rush, The ranks of Freedom at a blow to crush! Scott, Wadsworth, Christie, Boyd, in strength arise With fire kindling the brave! Nor savage cries, Nor peals, nor vollied flames, their souls dismay, But, like a storm, roll darkening to the fray, Or the dire plunging of Niagara's floodâ Drenching their thirsty falchions in the blood Of savage life! Lo, as they thrust, they feel The bleeding heart convulsing on the steel! The tumult shakes the earth. A cloud of death, Pregnant with fire, hangs dreadful o'er the heath! At length, the foe in such profusion bleeds, He breaksâand as he flies, the cloud recedes! Thus had the patriots thrice the victory won, Ere to the west two hours the rapid sun Had drove his car. Not since a warrior's name, Were ever fields more worthy of their fame. Scarce Rensselaer had landed on the beach, When Dexter met him, and in grievous speech Reveal'd the treasonâthe appalling cause, That made the volunteers like dastards pause. The tongue of Rensselaer denies to speakâ While pale and crimson struggle in his cheek. Grief's ashy deathness seems to triumph nowâ Then, anger's fire melts off the pallid snow. His tongue at length found speech: âAnd can it be, That Strong has acted in his treachery? Confusion strike him! Darkness blind the day! Grief drowns my heart. O haste with me awayâ And have you stood alone? no soulânot one To brace thy sideâall,âall revoltedâgone? âGreat is that mind that can resist the power Of rank corruption in the sliding hourâ And stem the current of opposing tide, And disregard, when scoffing tongues derideâ Remain unalter'd in thy faith the while, Full in the teeth and censure of the vile! Thy virtue will have fame! But time is lostâ I must endeavour to reclaim the host.â This saidâwith Dexter and the wounded Bloom, He sought the disaffected, to illume Their hearts with patriot flame: âIt cannot be, That you'll forsake us at this urgency? Thrice hath the Eagle in the battle tower'dâ With one to five the regal strength o'erpower'd! Egypt's Invincibles receiv'd a shock, From which they'll never riseâthe death of Brock! âBrothers, companions, friends! come, lend your aidâ We'll do such deeds as ne'er in time shall fade! With speed of wings the traitor wretch hath fled, Whose syren voice your generous hearts misled. Be lifted in the cause! walk forth in light, And shroud the past in ever-during night! Walk in the light of fame! Your brothers join Toiling for glory!ânot the ideal line, A barrier proveâbut prove your father's blood Lives in each fibre! Navigate the flood! Your fathers sacrific'd to Freedom's causeâ Yeaâdrain'd life's fountain-streams to seal her laws! And have they toil'd, and fought, and bled in vain? Shall we this day their hallow'd memories stain? âYe Saints in heaven! look down from thrones of light,â And O, our hearts in brotherhood unite! Inspire our souls with that celestial flame, Which gave your mem'ries an immortal name! âPatriots, free born! give glory to your sires By wakening into life their quenchless fires! âIf language fails your bosoms to excite, Behold the blood that stream'd on yonder Height! Behold, and kindle to avenge the goreâ Nor Bloom aloneâa host of worthies more Have suffer'd in their joy! Some sleep with those, Who, in their deaths, eternity have chose! âO think! for you they've render'd up their lives, To guard your altars, children, and your wives! And have they vain, like water, pour'd their blood? Yea, vainâin vainâunless ye pass the flood, And aid us with your strength. Come, float the tide, And soon the day with honour we'll decideâ A day, whose deeds of brilliancy will hide Days now that shine conspicuous on the sightâ Why stand ye pausing?âonward to the fight! What's life to Liberty?âlighter than dustâ Onâand the foe surrenders at a thrust! âBehold, advancing from the fort of Georgeâ A host o'erwhelming, on the time to charge! O hasten to the beach! I'll guide you o'erâ And at a blow, immortalize the shore! âO marble, cruel hearts! Behold my thin locks bleach'd by wint'ry years! Let me entreat you by these scattering hairs To climb yon battlements!â âGood heaven above! Goneâlostâforever lostâwill nothing move? Nor fame, nor blood, nor tears!â âWherefore was I Born to beholdât' endure this treachery! âPatriots in heaven behold itâyeaâand weepâ It seems my heart no longer can I keep Pent in my breastâit leaps to burst my sideâ To crack its fibresâspill its pulsing tideâ âShameâtreasonâshame!â His strengthâhis utterance fail, His cheeks, late flush'd with fire, turn ashy pale. Sighs heave his bosom, and his changing eye Betrays the passion of his agony: Now Anger seems to struggle with Despairâ But Grief triumphant, holds her empire there. At length, to Dexter he: âTo Wadsworth hieâ And speak it, if thou canst, this infamy. My breast is smother'd. Anguish'd I forebode, That all in vain our streams of life have flow'd. It eats my heart. Nothing I more can addâ My brain feels dizzyâall my soul is sad.â Dexter, desponding, wheels without discourse, Whilst the pale veteran weeps upon his horse. Adown his furrow'd cheeks his sorrows roll, Soothing the grief that eats upon his soul. But when reflection flashes o'er his mind, That all his fame will be a chaff in wind, A burning pang more sharp than death severe, Sears, dries the sluices of his softening tear. Veteran! mourn not: If this my verse can give Thy worth to other years, thy fame shall live! 'Tis not for man, his destinies to guideâ Full oft his best exertions are denied To meet the righteousness of merit hereâ Yea, Virtue o'er her child lets fall a tear. If for the moment, thou should'st feel the tooth Of biting Slander, yet the light of truth Will blaze upon thee in a future dayâ And Time shall weep thy monumental clay. And now from George, the enemy is seen, Progressing slowâsevere in discipline. And, as with Wallace they approach the Height, The vanquish'd allies round his flag unite. A heavy cloud is thus by whirlwinds driven, Broken and scatter'd o'er the face of heavenâ But soon the winds are bridled in their mightâ And lo, another climbs the mountain height, Round which those scatter'd by the tempest power, Urg'd by attraction, with a deepening lower, Gather with closeness,âdarkening broad and vast, To smite the earth with desolating blast: So those, late scatter'd by the battle's breath, Round Wallace congregate to pour out death. Vincent the whole combines, as first in rank, The wild-men crowding on his skirted flank. He speaks to their ambition: âShall we cower And lick the dust beneath th' invading power? With five oppos'd to one disgrac'd we've fledâ O let it neverânever more be said! Resolve to winâwipe off the murky stain! Conquest is ours! The Lion shakes his main, Threatening the field! In anger hold the breath, And be reveng'd for Brock's illustrious death. He lies in gory vestments! Riseâbe strong, And drive through paths of blood th' adventurous throng. Their ranks are wastedâweaken'd on the field, Hence, will to conquer, and behold they yield! Ten hours they've fought, and none have borne them aidâ A valorous charge and soon their laurels fade! âBrock is the word! With bayonets ten to one, Britannia lives!âthe toils of battle done!â The savages replied with deafening jarâ The Albions dash'd in madness to the war. But lo, th' impetuous rush the brave withstand, And prove a barrier to the charging band. They stand like rocks imbedded in the sea, Which thousand waves attempt to wash away. In vain the billows rollâin vain they crash Their craggy sidesâin vain with foam they dash And thunder at their baseâunshook in form, The rocks remain and smile upon the storm: So stand Columbians solid in the fight, Plunging whole ranks successive into night. Wadsworth outpours his voice: âImmortal hour! Mix lead with steel, and let the soul have power! Thine every name will high in heaven be roll'dâ Drainâdrain the heart! Let streams of death unfold! Resist a momentâbut a moment more, And ample strength will reach us from the shore!â The warriors seem'd as fire! So vast the strife, The forest trees are wither'd of their life. Beneath their feet the rocks to dust return, Whilst vaulting lightnings round about them burn. For two half hours with tyger strength they fightâ The whole field blacken'd with the cast of night. But Dexter comes! âThe volunteers deny To pass the flood and gain the victory!â Were earth to open by exploding powerâ Were Chimborasoâearth's sublimest tower, To totter to its fallâwere stars in heaven, Blinded of lightâthe world to darkness givenâ Scarce would it cause more direful despair, Freezing the soul than words of Dexter were! Their hearts are wither'dâall their hopes forlorn, As when the blighting east subdues the tender corn. With hearts in anguish they forsake the shore, Sprinkling their rock-path with the drops of gore! A shouting triumph from the foe is given, While they display their regal sign in heaven! Now when the storm was hush'dâthe brave o'erborne, Arnold receiv'd the serpent hiss of scorn From every tongueâwhich cramp'd his haughty soul, Causing dark thoughts across his mind to roll. Far in the deep recesses of the wood, He thus the workings of his breast pursu'd: âWhat heart can bear the eating of remorse? Ah, whither shall I flyâwhere bend my course To bury from the world? Each eye severe Plants daggers in my soul, as with a sneer They with a point exclaim: âThe traitor there! Mark his disorder'd step! see what despair Pales in his haggard cheek!ââ âMy breastâmy breast! 'Tis hellâa burning hell!âno peaceâno restâ Distraction all!â âShould I from man retire, Where could I fly from the consuming fire, Which boils my heart within? Yawnâyawn, deep hell! Prepare! I come! Ye furies toll my knell! âAway,âpale thought, away! I'll do the deed. I'll break the chainânor stay, But tasteâtaste what?â âMy heart!âwhat ails my heart! What means this ice? And have I struck the dart? âWhat, shrink to ply the point!â âDeath! what art thou! 'Tis but thy name that chills our blood like snow. Thy secret touch dissolves the pangs of griefâ To conscience tortur'd, thou art restârelief. Why at thy name starts back the coward soul, Thou balm, that makes the broken-hearted whole! Is it thy form that doth the horror bring? And do I fear thy momentary sting? What sting?âthy sting is peaceâthe pang is slight, That brings oblivionârocks the soul in night. âWhat if I breathe this element away, Burden'd with life, till vile, unhonour'd clay Shall shroud me from the sun? will not thy dart, With equal keenness touch the shrinking heart? It mustâit will! Through Death I'll freedom gain, And break at once, the fragile, brittle chain, That binds me to the earth! I'll not endure The sneering of the worldâI'll seek the cure Of treasonâTreason!â âWorse than coward, he, Who shrinking, trembling with a tottering knee, Gives back!â âWhy pausing do I keep? Death, I am thineâcome, rock me in thy sleep.â With hurried hand he forms the fatal nooseâ And, for a moment, a brief thought pursues: âThou passing Breeze, that travels o'er the heath, Receive my voice and speak it after death: âBeware, O Youth! how you in pleasures roveâ They'll sap the mindâinsidious, damning prove! With happy flowers at first they'll strew the wayâ But ah, beware!âbasilisks and adders lay Conceal'd in ambush there, whose poisonous teeth Will lance thy soul, more sharp than sting of death. O fly th' enchanted ground! A blast will come Unknownâand sweep thee to a culprit's tomb!â This was his last distinguishable wordâ Behold, he strangles in the tight'ning cord! His mouth yawns wide, of air to taste one breath, But every breeze is chas'd away by Death. His features blacken deepâhis eyeballs stare, Outswell'd with blood,âtight, strangling with despair. 'Tis midnight's hurried hour. With solemn dread, Dark, murky clouds hang round the mountain's head, Thick, broken, deep:âSlow-heaving, vast, they climb, Fold after fold the starry arch sublime; And, as they darkening o'er the concave sail, The winking eyes of heaven reluctant fail. Again they shineâagain they disappear, As move the clouds with labour up the sphere. In the far east their folds thin-edg'd with grey, The moon behind the mountain cliffs betray, Slow, waning, pale:âher sickly, fading horn Is bent behind a cloudâyet her faint light, With sallow paleness shows the round of night. A wonder!âlo, with questionable mein, The new-fledg'd ghost of Morris wan is seen Faint gliding on the moon's thin watery rayâ Making the couch were dreaming Mary lay, Gazing delighted on her lover's eye, In which appears the soul's divinity: âColdâ Cold as the dark brown rockâcold as the mould, Thine Edward's brow is laid! Dream not of meâ I'm now as airâcommenc'd eternity!â Thus he, while wrapp'd in night's deep mantle spoke,â And Mary, shivering, from her slumbers broke: âWhat voice pronounc'd my name?âwhat note of death Sung in mine ear? Cold on the battle heath My Edward sleeps in blood! Ah, meâmy breast! Cold on the earth his love-bright features rest!â Sighing she fainted on her pillow deadâ But thus again, her lover's spirit said, Which mov'd upon her heart. âFair angel form! Awake thy soul to life! I've past the storm Of this rough tempest world. Thy grieving ceaseâ Though we no moreânoânever can embrace, Here, in mortality: But O, above, We soon shall meet and clasp, perfective love! âBut clogg'dâembosom'd in thy cumbering clay, Thou canst not hear what now my tongue could say, Or I could open such a field of blissâ Ah, noâtoo pure for angels to express! It satisfies the soul!âBeyond frail earth, To hear the wonders of celestial birth. Thine eye, thine ear, thine every sense is dumb, To see, to hear the joys, that live beyond the tomb! âBut, when thy house of beauty shall decay, Then shalt thou bask in unextinguish'd dayâ Quaff fountains, pure of love without alloy, And bind thine Edward in the clasp of joy! âTill then, farewell! and calm thy aching breastâ Resign to heavenâand be thy soul at rest.â The Spirit ceas'dâand wing'd its airy flight Beyond the stars, and sought the coast of light. His voice consoling, sooth'd his anguish'd loveâ Her slumbers came with dreams of heaven above. CANTO XXII. CAPTURE OF LITTLE YORK. ARGUMENT. An Express informs Brown of the result at Queenstown .... Officers convene in Council .... The Embarkation for Little York .... The Descent .... The Death of Hatfield .... Explosion of the Magazine .... Capture of York .... The circumstance of a scalp being found in the Legislative Hall .... The Death of General Pike. The sceneâSackett's Harbour, and in and about Little York .... The time is four days. When the deep anguish of the late event, By sorrow's tears was made more lenient, A solemn calmness settled on their breastâ And Rensselaer to Carr gave this behest: âYoung warrior, hasten to the Harbour down, And bear the death-news to the ear of Brown. My heart is bitterness to name the deedâ It makes my sorrows in their freshness bleed.â The youth swift mounted at the order given, And flewâan arrow from an archer driven. The second sun was making glad the east, When he to Brown was sighing introduc'd. So deep his heart was overcome by grief, He stood in silence dumb before the chief. The warrior mark'd depression in his eye And breast, that strove to hide its agony. âGive freedom to thy heart. Say, generous youth, What the disaster, with unmuffled truth. My soul forebodes the army is subdu'd, And Rensselaer is folded in his blood. But keep thy soul erect: Defeat will come, And cause of censure none. I read the gloom, Deep struggling in thine eye. Thy grief forbearâ And never yield thy country in despair.â âThy voice hath rais'd a mountain from my breast; The dead, cold message, all my powers oppress'd. Too, too severe is thy foreboding justâ Our hard fought victories are wrapp'd in dust. Thrice we our standards had with glory crown'dâ The sun of heaven in all his circles round Ne'er look'd upon a field of prouder name Than that of Queenstown, by the sons of fameâ A time there was, he shrunk before the sightâ The clash of horror brought a partial night! But in the act to seize upon a fourthâ Such spirit dwelt with the Columbian birthâ Disunion snatch'd the prize! Lo, Strong's brigade, Revolting from the cause, withdrew their aid. First Dexter tried, then Rensselaer, his art To rouse the passion of their coward heartâ In vainâtheir blood was frozen into iceâ They stood unmelting to their warm advice. As deep the veteran to their bosoms spoke, It seem'd at times his bursting heart was broke. His eye stream'd anguish:âfrom his every pore Large sweat distill'd with drops of suffering gore. âScott, Christie, Wool, and Boyd in glory stoodâ And Wadsworth lighten'd in the field of blood. Smyth cast the savage chiefâbound him to earth, While in the act to hurl his hatchet forth. Thrice broke the enemy before the shockâ In front of battle, fell the generous Brock! âThe second Rensselaer pour'd free his blood, But not to dying. Vallance drunk the flood. Wool, Christie, Gansevoort, Bloomâand worthies more, Have shed for Liberty their sacred gore. Their wounds but seem'd to magnify their ireâ Their bosoms kindled with a maddening fire! âYoung Morris fell in all his peerless bloomâ He moulders honour'd in a warrior's tombâ Alas, I fear not soâfor lo, I saw A savage grasp him as we fled the warâ My soul forebodes he feeds the hungry raven, Or vultures, crows, and other fowls of heaven! âHow bright a contrast ours!âalong the shore, I heard our guns, by minutes, solemn roar For death of Brock! Yeaâsorrowing gun for gun, Niagara answer'd at the setting sun! âSuch is a faint description of the day, Which fill'd the bravest bosoms with dismay.â Brown heard with fix'd attention. But full oft, His hand he clos'dâand then, relax'd it soft. His eye the language of his soul would speak, And show he held with pain a tear in check. Then would his forehead knitâhis colour rise, And indignation muster in his eyes. âWas Strongâ âHis very name is pestilenceâ I cannot drive it from my bosom hence. A traitor, gifted with a serpent artâ In look a saint;âa devil at his heartâ A smooth, insinuating adder sly, Who, while he charms with meek Religion's eye, Stings with a tooth envenom'd to the lifeâ Prayer in his mouthâbeneath his cloak a knife! Accepter of a bribeâhis country's shameâ Why do I spend a thought upon his nameâ âAt times the Star can sink without disgraceâ For human wisdom can but partial trace The slippery changes of the future hour, Though every mind possess'd a Newton's power. We cannot hope in every field to gain The perilous fightâthe laurell'd wreath obtain. Dark clouds, unlook'd-for, in the storm will rise And sweep the standards backward from the skies. Yet will the brave have honourâ âI behold My chiefs approach, whose hearts are fin'd as gold. Them I instructed at th' appearing sun, To meet and plan what farther should be done.â Brief as he clos'd, the patriotick band, Leaders of squadrons, gather'd at his handâ Pike in advance, then Forsythe, King, MacClure, Names to show brilliant while the streams endure. Swan, Ripley, Fanning, Eustis, Lyon, Steel, Never with life before a foe to kneelâ Backus, Nicholson, Happock, Bloomfield, Young, Express a dignity of feeling strong. Mitchell, and Walworth, Frazier, Pierce, and Moore, From whose dark eyes their bosom'd passions pour. Chauncey and Hatfield of the fleet appear, Their hearts firm plated from the shaft of fear. Thompson and others from the ships attend To hear what plans the chiefs would recommend. When these the first in office had conven'd, Brown brief related what from Carr he'd glean'd; Each bosom felt a paralytick blow, To hear that traitors had the Stars dash'd low. He paus'dâand after thus: âBe not depress'd, The Eagle yet will tear the Lion's crest. The names of Scott, of Christie, Rensselaer, Will, on the pinnacle of fame appearâ And Bloom, and Wadsworth, Woolâand all the brave, Who fought and conquer'd at Niagara's waveâ Yesâconquer'dâthrice the battle field was wonâ Never in valour was the day outdone. âNow it is ours to suddenly away, And open on them with a bold essay. While in their joy, they apprehend us lost, We'll crowd the fleetâinvade upon their coastâ Dash at Fort George: Should eagle Vict'ry there, Perch on our arms, to Erie we'll repair, And fold the Cross in dust. Let each adviseâ For we in band of unity must rise. With bosoms firm cemented in the fight, Great is the energy of Freedom's might; But man divided, is a chain of dust, He breaks in weakness at the slightest just.â He sate; and Pike aroseâwithin whose breast, Heaven's choicest virtues found their pillow'd rest: âBrothers in arms! my heart is touch'd with pain, That those, made free with Liberty, should stain The land that gave them birthâbeyond compare, Favour'd of heaven, of all creation fair! That lurking traitors should contrive with art, To stab the centre of their Country's heart! âBut we the stain opprobrious must remove, The soul unbroken of the nation prove: âNow I submiss an humble thought will urge, That we assail, before we strike at George, Their capital, proud Yorkâwhich place is known To form the northern store-house of the throne. Should we succeed to overcome the wholeâ Of which I doubt not, should we charge with soul,â 'Twill the rejoicings of the Royals dampâ Their future movements in the contest cramp. 'Twill be remember'd for its daring blowâ Perhaps, the pivot of their overthrow. âWhere the waste ruins of Torronto lie, We'll land,âthe efforts of the foe defy, From thence with rapidness the batteries storm, And take possession of the place in form.â He open'd his design. And Neptune's sonâ Chauncey, uncourtly, on the right begun: âMy order from the President of late Is, that the navy at your service wait. Should you the measure approbate of Pike, The fleet is ready on the shore to strike.â Brief was the mariner. And Brown replies: âThe plan of Pike will quail our enemies. Let each prepare to presently embark, And true to valour, at the town of York Rush for the honour. Pike, to you I yield, As you advis'd it,âto conduct the field. âChauncey, the fibres of your heart beat life, Th' impressing foe to overcome in strifeâ Make full your navy with the warriors proud, And then your sail-wings for Torronto crowd. âWhat time we're absent, Backus, with your horse, Maintain the sail against invading force, Should he, who flames salutes for Raisin's blood, Prevostâattempt the Harbour to intrudeâ Our wives, our children from the village move, Then, unalloy'd your gold in battle prove. From the interior, Tuttle, nerv'd with steel, Will soon arrive, their entrance to repel. âNow is our purpose laid. Each to his post, And straight embark to war upon the coast.â Brief at the word pronounc'd, the council rose, Their hearts determin'd with the foe to close. The troops rejoic'd th' invading plan to hearâ The sound was pleasant musick to their ear. With rapid hand the ships with war they load Without disorder, though they seem a crowd Thick, wild, confus'd: So, frequent is there seen, In summer's day, along the pathway green, A numerous household of industrious ants, Hoarding with foresight 'gainst their future wants. At first, disorder'd they appear to moveâ Part in the sun, part shaded in the grove. But when with closer eye we scan their line, Both art and science in their ranks combineâ The band returning, sweat beneath their load, While those disburden'd are in quest of food: Thus, though in hurry, order is their toilâ And soon embark'd they wait the spreading sail. Chauncey weighs anchorâcleaves the silver sea, And, as the east was gladdening with the day, York show'd its turrets. With a martial mien, On board the Madison, the chiefs convene To learn their stations,â(Madison, the ship That bore the foremost flag upon the deep.) These were the glowing sentiments of Pike: âBehold the capitol! Prepare to strike Its standard from the wind! The soul make large T' invade the shore and do the signal charge. âForsythe, to lead upon the foe is thine, And prove your rifles, death in discipline. King, strengthen with your warriors, and, MacClureâ Your names establishâever to endure. Then, Pierce and Ripley, with your bands proceed, And test them worthy of immortal meed. Riddle, with scout, will you in front advance At landingâto observe each circumstance. âOn us the prize of victory dependsâ As is our course the Eagle sinks, ascendsâ Yea, as a chieftain educates his soul, He warms with ardour, or he damps the whole.â The warriors, yielding their assent, withdraw To wield their blades, determin'd in the war. Now when the Albions kenn'd th' approaching fleet, Their haughty bosoms sudden flash'd with heat. Sheffie, half madded, sent his aids in haste To call his leaders where his flag was plac'd: First, Goodwin came, of Fencibles the chiefâ Then, Wells, of Grenadiersâthen, Cowley, briefâ Churchill and White, from batteries caught th' alarms, When the drums beating notified to arms. They circled in a groupâgrim Talpo last, A murky savage of the howling waste. AssembledâSheffie in the midst began, And quick arrang'd his well-digested plan: âBehold invasion on the waters there! The screaming Eagle floating on the air! But time waits not to stand with gazing eyesâ Attend my voice to blast our enemies! âGoodwin, your Fencibles in column form At water's edge, to waken up the storm. Talpo, in silence hover on his flank, And crouch your well-train'd warriors on the bank, Deep in the hiding growth. And void of fears, Wells, fix for action with your Grenadiers On Goodwin's left division. Churchill, White, Defend the bulwarks with an arm of might. Cowley, at entrance of the town remain, Till I command you to the field of slain. I, with reserve, shall stand in yonder woodâ And when I move, my standard waves in blood! âEre the invaders touch upon the beach, To the life's centre let the bullet reach. Let nothing of the foe pollute the landâ Let not a foot-print violate the sand! âThink how at Queenstown, Vincent late hath drove This flag, the same, like fire in piney grove, Through havock, blood and death! And shall not we Prove that we hold the same integrity? Prove it? Yes!âthis earth itself shall fail, Ere, recreant, we in mean submission quail! âThey neverânever to the beach draw nigh, Except beneath our falchion-blades to die. But mark, their progress for Torronto driven! Away!âprepare to break the sphere of heaven!â They play their forces, and in threatening gloom Lead forth, th' invading patriots to entomb. Like autumn leaves, they drive along the path, When rude winds tear them from the trees in wrath. Talpo conceals with savage art his broodâ Goodwin is shaded by th' adjoining wood. Wells places on his left the Grenadiersâ While Sheffie dark, who hell nor heaven reveres, Hies to a forest on a rising ground, To overlook the battle-field around. Forsythe was now impatient to proceedâ Pike gives the word: The rowers dash with speed, While in firm hands the twisted rifles show, With deep-drove bullets ready for the foe. They near the shore where Fencibles are hid With lurking savages, sighting the bead Glimmering with death! With shout they dart the fireâ Forth Goodwin's blade is seen to flash its ireâ His Fencibles behold, and wrap in flame Ontario roundâand swift repeat the same. In vain the blazing sheetsâin vain the lead Sings through the airâin vain the thunders dread Tremble the earthâin vain the lightnings gleam And play horrifick o'er the tossing streamâ In vain the shrieking of the savage noteâ Like spirits on the wing the rifles float Unshaken to the shore! no winking eye At the red flashes which around them flyâ Onward they move, half smiling at the storm, Which burns the elements in lightning form! At length is Forsythe heard: âSlacken the oars! Draw bead upon the foe! return the showers Which tempest-beat the flood.â The hero said. The barges, pausing, settled on their bed Of buoyant waters. Partially at rest, The green-clad warriors with a rocky breast Fix'd on the silver with their eyes of fire, And touch'd the springs!âthe sleeping leads expire With flaming breath, which drives them to the shore, To cool their burning in the hostile gore. Forsythe exclaims: âIn conquering terror rise! Exalt the soul, and snatch th' immortal prize! Dash forward in the blast! the barges fly! Strike opposite to where the savage lieâ There make the beachâin solid order standâ Mix fire with steel, and desolate the land!â The barges heard, and flew upon the deep Like things of life, so rapid was their leap. Pike kept his vision fasten'd on the Greens, As they advanc'd t' unfold the deathful scenesâ Great was his joy to see them disregard The engin'd fire, which beat against them hard; But ah, his soul with jealousy was pain'd, What time they balanc'd on their oars remain'd. He fear'd their courage was a melting rock, Yielding appall'dâdishearten'd by the shock, Which smote upon them sore! On board the barge He sprungâgave Nicholson and Frazier charge, His aids, to followâand abrupt to King: âEmbarkâaway!âquick to the combat bring Thy warriors to the test! The rifles pause! Hasteâhasten onâor ruin'd is the cause!â Hurried he spoke. His barge leaps from the shipâ And King's battalions cleave the troubled deep. Behold the clouds of Pike's desponding fears Are scatter'd from his mind, and joy appears! He scans the cause why Forsythe's rifles stoodâ To aim more certain on the tossing flood. His features brighten with effulgent blazeâ His tongue transported crowns their names with praise: âMy soul is floating in a tide of day! What passing worth th' immortal Greens display! My soul was darknessânow it walks in light To mark their deedsâa stream of death in fight! The enemyâhe breaks! On, Forsythe, onâ We are behind thee! Snatch the standards down!â While this he utter'd, Forsythe made the shore, And op'd at every flash a fount of gore. The savage flewâbut Goodwin for a time, With veteran host, withstood the war sublime. But Forsythe met him in his path at length, And struck him to the earth unpower'd of strength. Their leader gaspingâwasting of his breathâ The Albions scatter'd from the streams of death. During this effort, Pike's battalions reach The shore of blood, and land upon the beach, Though Wells, incessant with impetuous ire, Pour'd down a cataract of tempest fire! Pike gives the rushing charge: âAscend the bank! Ascend, ye brave, in solid bolted rank! Shout victory or deathâthe deathless wordâ Let blood bedim the brightness of the sword!â âVictory or Death! Death or Victory!â Echoes to heaven from band of Liberty. The brow of Pike is half conceal'd in blazeâ His stature seems in awfulness to raise. His sword, a beam of light, illumes the way, As on he dashes in the thickest fray! As flames a scathing meteor through the night, So shines the warrior in the darkening fight. The band, directed by his falchion's gleam, Support their chief and draw out blood a stream; Death melts the foe!âwith life a remnant fly, As Forsythe's bugles echo, Victory! Now when the army from the ships were freed, Chauncey was prompted to a valiant deedâ 'Twas thisâthe fleet against the forts to moor, To aid the descent with his naval power. His views are answer'd: opposite the site Of each dark mound, sustain'd by Churchill, White, His anchors bite the clayâthe engines burst With globes to smite the fortified to dust. The foe undaunted, from the breasted earth, Against the navy roll'd the mad balls forthâ But most with truant aim at random fly, Searching in vain for death through vacancy; But one, with thunder hurl'd, strikes Thompson's breastâ He falls from life insensible to rest. And lo, another, as a cannon spoke, Glanc'd Hatfield's thigh,âand bone in fragments broke, And flesh tore loose, save fibres here and there, Which held the limb from whirling off in air. Large from the artery hissing leaps the blood, Which, as it flows, is curdled in the flood. Chauncey with sorrow marks him as he diesâ The youth returns the look with fading eyes, And anxious thus: âI feel my life is goneâ But O, in whisper, tell me if I've done My duty in the cause for which I bleedâ Speak to mine earâmy ebbing sands recede!â Chauncey with gentleness receives his hand: âMy son, thou art an honour to thy land.â Here, smother'd with his grief, he fails to speakâ He wipes the tear that steals upon his cheek. Stammering, his voice returns: âMy dying sonâ Peace to thy soul! in every part you've done Thy country's honour! Long wilt thou endureâ Thy noble deeds have made thy praise secure.â Each word was softer than a minstrel's note, And made his swimming soul in transport float: So righteous Latimer, what time in fire, Suffering beneath a persecuting ire, Heard a bright angel with sweet whispering say: âMartyr! well done! to heaven I lead the way!â His soul forgot the eating pain severeâ He seem'd already climbing up the sphere. So thus, when Chauncey gave him tender praise, On pallid Death he cast a smiling gaze. He mov'd his tongue to utter back a wordâ But, in revenge, death barr'd him to afford That luxury sweet. He roll'd his fading eye Bright in a tearâmore precious than replyâ To Chauncey's hand a gentle press he gave, Which seem'd to say: âMy joy is in the grave!â Chauncey return'd the parting touch the same, Which warm'd his dying blood and made a flame Blush in his cheek! He smil'dâthen clos'd his eyeâ Swift launch'd to heaven his immortality! Thus when extinguish'd is the taper's light, Still round the wick some lingering sparkles bright, Faint languish one by one:âsoon all is darkâ Lo, from its ashes shoots a glowing spark, But neverânever more! So Hatfield smil'd in death, Then, like a sleeping infant, sigh'd away his breath. When Sheffie, watching in the deep wood, saw His legions break before the rushing war, He pour'd his voiceâsmiting his breast in wrath, And, as with frenzy, foam'd along his path: âIt must be false! It never can be so! What, hath invasion wrought an overthrow? Why do you stand in listless coward gaze? Break to the battle! Let the searching blaze Of utmost hell, flame heaven! Glut them with deathâ Outnoise the elements! Bury them beneath!â Convuls'd with rage, his tight-strain'd eyes shot bloodâ Down with reserve he darkens from the wood, Black, like a tempest scowling o'er the earth, Edg'd round with lightningsâmuttering thunders forth. Pike stands a monumentâa rockâa tower, And smiles in soul to mark th' approaching power. His eyes the radiance of two stars is given, When recent wash'd by summer showers of heaven: âBehold the squadrons pouring from the wood, Rough in their arms to sacrifice our blood! I mark you shivering with desire to move To meet them in the fieldâyour daring prove. Why doth my speech withhold you from your fameâ Rush to the charge like heaven's consuming flame. âKing, lead the battleâlet thy soul be fireâ Let tumult darken as thy foes expire.â Swift, at the silence of his tongue, they spring Mad on the enemyâled forth by King. Like streams from mountain cliffs the Albions pour, Flashing combustion with exploding roar; But those of Liberty resist the shockâ Rising in soulâimmoveableâa rock, Which stands and laughs at Susquehannah's flood, When down it tumbles in its wildest mood! The field burns into flame! In smoke and night The warring powers are smother'd from the sight. A transient gale now whirls the cloud away, And lo, the scene comes flashing into day, A momentâthenâno more! a sword-blade gleamsâ A bayonet dipp'd in life-blood smoking streams; A plumeâa standardâtrembles on the eye, And forth they vanish in obscurity. Death gleans a fattening harvest: Hoppock diesâ And Lyon wrapp'd in crimson garments liesâ Not words can give their characterâtheir fame, Their deeds alone are worthy to proclaimâ Their smiting falchions magnified the fray, Nor fail'd their lives till brittle steel gave way: The point of Hoppock's blade was thrust betwixt The neck and skull, and there in wedge was fix'dâ While in the act to wrench it from the bone, Tingling it snapp'd!âunarm'd, his life was done. A foeman plung'd a bayonet through his sideâ His life departed with the ebbing tide. So oft had Lyon's sword the brain-walls broke, Its edge was batter'd by the frequent strokeâ He threw it by to seize upon the hilt Of one made vainâfor he the blood had spilt Which gave it power to kill. While stooping down To make the trophy hisâno vulgar clown, But Sheffie, rushing as he done the deedâ (Ere he could loose it from the griping dead,) Broke through the guards that fenc'd his youthful heart, And tore the centre of its threads apart. The Muse might swell her page with Albion's deadâ And some were worthy of the honour'd bed. Her strength would languish ere the half were toldâ A host all ghastly in their blood were roll'd. Pike puts away the smile from off his cheeks, And plants deep anger thereâabrupt he speaks To those in strength reserv'd: âThe fight demands, It calls the proudest labours of our hands! With steel plunge forward to the field of deathâ The thirsty bayonet to the foe bequeath!â He spurs his courser to the strifeâhis soul Pours from his eyes, which like two comets roll. As vast Niagara plunges down the steep With foam and thunder to the boiling deep, Breaking the rocks and grinding them to dustâ So Pike's divisions in the battle thrust! King joins the hero blacken'd in the fightâ The hand of Death o'erwraps the field in night, Awful as Egypt, on that dreadful day, A God in anger snatch'd the light away! Awful as when that signal hour shall come, When all that lives shall moulder to a tomb! Awful as this, the field of blood appears, Whilst clash of armies thunders up the spheres! At times a burst of fire breaks through the night, Opening to view the tumult of the fightâ But hovering Death quick closes up the scene, Rejoicing on the blast with hideous mien. Pike gleams behind the darkness like the sun, Centred in heaven when shrouded by the moon. He bounds, he thunders, lightens in his wrath, Carving whole files before him in his path. Fredonia comes, and kindles in his hand The fiery edge of his consuming brandâ Like when the artist, from the furnace heat, Withdrew the steelâto give it curve complete, Red hissing from the flame: So even now, By the blest touch, sparks from the falchion glow, And live upon its edge! At every sweep, Whole ranks, opposing, find eternal sleep. Yet, Sheffie stands untam'd in all his ire, Urging the battle in its fury higher! The patriots mark the flaming sword of Pike, And like the spirits of the storm they strike. Their thirsty blades drink copious draughts of blood, And still more greedy suck the vital flood. Sheffie rolls backward like a broken wave, Leaving behind a carnage for the grave! âHeroes! pause notâbut rush yon bulwarks on! Downâdown those standards, and the war is done! York falls in weaknessâkneels beneath our powersâ Fame lights the pathâthe dayâthe fight is ours!â Pike gave the word:âa word is all they needâ The column moves to consummate the deed. The forted Lions cowering from their height Fall as the Eagle waves upon their sight! Pike manifests his virtue: âLo, thus far, We've gain'd unclouded glory in the war. York is a reed, that bends before our mightâ It kneels, and in its kneeling, ends the fight. Warriors! let nothing that's debasing stain Our laurels, gather'd on yon gory plain. But let forgiveness glorify the line, That round our brows unfading wreaths may twine. Bury the past in brilliance of renown, By generous entertaining of the Crown With Mercy's banquet: Great, though great our cause To scowl a cold defiance at her laws. But should we treat the enemy severe, Where would distinction of our worth appear? Noâgood for evil to our foes return, That Virtue's incense in our breasts may burn. âBut should there be a wretch to honour lost, Not he shall dull the splendour of our boastâ With message swift shall he be judg'd to death, Stamp'd with the stain of infamy beneath. âRiddle, proceed with observation onâ Wary observe the borders of the town. Mark if the Albions linger on the fieldâ Or in submission to our banners yield.â Riddle progresses with a cautious eye, The routed movements of the foe to spy. The meantime Sheffie, in despair of soul, Foam'd like a tyger loosen'd from control. At times he wheel'd to rush upon his deathâ And then he'd pause insensible of breath. While thus his passion in its madness burn'd,â And while from this to that, he furious turn'd, His frenzied eyeball glanc'd the magazine, With all its quick destruction stow'd within. A thought of hell flash'd rapid through his brain, To touch and blaze the ruin on the plain! âThis, this will satisfy to rack their soulâ No flag shall ever bend. Against them roll Flames in a torrent! This their final dateâ Them in revenge will this annihilate!â He chok'd for want of air:âturn'd his rag'd eye, And thus continued to his soldiery: âAnd are ye Britons? whither will ye hence? And will ye no revengeâno recompense? Standâcrowd the magazine with rocks of weight, To fall through heaven their ranks to desolate. âChurchill, 'tis thine the secret train to lay, Then touch the sparkle, and with wings away. Each will be knighted from the royal hand, When once their hearts lie crush'd upon the land.â They standâobey his voiceâand soon with toil, Collect and place upon the mine, a pile Of rocks of besom power,âshells, bars, and ball, With various ruin on the brave to fall. Full fifty tons of death's exploding grain Are lodg'd within,âfrom which the fatal train Artful is laid by Sheffie and his crewâ Th' Infernal near to urge them what they do. CompletedâChurchill to the match sets fire, And, while it smoulders, back the host retire. The time that Riddle trac'd the path along, To mark th' instructions of the British throng, Pike wheel'd to gain a seatâwhen lo, his ear Caught the deep sound of heavy sorrow near. He search'd and found an enemy in blood, In danger to be crush'd beneath the crowd. âCome, my sad stranger, let me aid you, comeâ I'll be your friend, and shelter you with home.â This said. He rais'd, and on his bosom bore The fainting Briton from his bed of gore. The soldier strives to speakâhis soul appears Damping his eyesâhe thanks him with his tears. This office done, he settles to a seat, Till Riddle should observe the foe's retreat. What soul is not at rest to virtue given, Performing deeds that meet the eye of heaven! An Albion brother having seen the deed, Modest approach'd him and with deference said: âBe not offended at my rudeness nearâ I've come to thank you with a brother's tear. My tongue moves awkward, but my heart is warmâ I thought you savage as the northern storm.â Thus he. Pike answer'd: âBriton, fear us not; The bleeding warrior never was forgot. How rank is Slander's tongue! Columbians know How to forgive the darkness of their foe.â The Albion then: âDelusive, I've been taught, That you for booty, or for victims foughtâ That nothing sacred ever reach'd your mind, More than the tyger or the savage kindâ That polish'd virtues to the west world here, Were far more rude than Europe's forester. And hence, they plead it righteous on the main To bind your seamen in Impressment's chain, That they might haply in our navy learn Something of civil life, ere their return! âBut now, I scan it as deception all, That they might righteous this contention call. The name of Freedom is the cankering sore, Which eats like death's tooth to their life's deep core.â He paus'd. And Pike with smiling took the word: âThe acts of virtue their own bliss affordâ Man feels divine impulsion in his breast, When his soul strives to make his fellow blest. He needs no tongue to tell him of the deedâ A whispering conscience is sufficient meedâ Yeaâmore refreshing than the new-born gale Made rich with incense from the flower-dress'd vale, Or dews that paradiseâ âGod!âO God!â Dread shock! The steadfast pillars of creation rock! The magazine is blazing up to heaven! The earth seems reelingâfrom its centre riven! To kindled Ãtna add Vesuvian flames, With all the burning mountains that have namesâ To these mix earthquakes ruinous and dire, With all their spouting cataracts of fireâ Ten thousand thunders join to this dread mass, With all the lightnings since creation wasâ Let all explode at once,âtremendous jar! Earth-rending, hell-shaking, heaven-breaking warâ Scarce would the scene more horrible appear, Than house of death convulsing through the sphere! Trees rent, and bars, shells, rocks, o'er Riddle flyâ Pillars of dust roll dreadful through the sky, An awful darkness blots the heavens from sight, The earth is compass'd with the pall of night. The dead are stirr'd within their tombs beneathâ The graves yawn wide their marble jaws of death. The fragments falling, smite the earth below, Crushing the brittle life of friend and foe. Yea,âe'en the murderers by the shock expireâ Too soon for them, the earthly hell took fire. Fifty Columbians and two hundred die, By dastard actâthe act of infamy! A shell strikes Bloomfield, bursting o'er his headâ Without a sigh he joins the broken dead: Thus stood a youthful poplar, gemm'd with dew, Fair on the mountain, pleasant to the viewâ The May-day sun delighted, kiss'd its crownâ But lo, it sunk beneath the whirlwind's frownâ Its brittle boughs were scatter'd o'er the heath: So the youth perish'dâbroken in his death. Nicholson, Frazier, by the General stoodâ Bothâboth are mangledâfloating in their blood! Black from the element a whirling rock, As Pike exclaim'd, upon his temples struckâ Crack'd the brain's casementâbruis'd along his cheek, And crush'd upon his ribs!â Faint, dying, meek,â He sinks upon the earth like wreath of snow, When melting from its rock. His features show Life's cistern failing of its streamâ Statues of stone His columns standâcoldâpetrifiedâundone! But to behold the failing of their chief, O'erpowers the horribleâthey melt to grief: Thus while a mother in a frightful storm, Presses her infant to her bosom warm, A vollied sheet of solid fire descends, And instant thunder from the cloud impends, Aghast she stands, convuls'd with horror dumb, Cold, like a pillar bas'd upon a tomb.â But when her veins of life begin to burn, Back to her child her anxious thoughts returnâ She views it in her arms, all black with death! At once,âherself is lostâwith hurried breath, And deep, her bosom heavesâdespairing, wildâ She thinks of nothing but her strangled child: So stand the brave,âof self they think no more, To see their chief stretch'd lifeless in his gore! But lo, he breathesâhe leans upon his hand, And thus while dying to his sorrowing band: âPush, my brave fellows, and avenge my death!â He spokeâsunk backâexhausted of his breath. As when the last concluding hour shall come To rouse the silent tenants of the tombâ The earth, the firmament, as parchment scroll, Folded togetherâdeath seizing on the soulâ Lo, mid the horrors of chaotick night, A voice is heard from seraph veil'd in light: âThe past is done! Behold creation new!â A sudden wonder bursts upon the view! Four suns in golden brilliancy appearâ Two brightening the eastâtwo the western sphere, The earth melts into heaven! in glancing eye Man livesâtranslated from mortality! So Pike's expiring words the brave reviveâ They seem from death to quicken, breathe, and live! The fifes, the bugles, and the drums reboundâ They shoutâshout victory! with triumph sound Ripley relocks the columnâleads it on To take possession of the yielding town. MacClare, with sympathy's soft-touching hand, Raises the chief to move him from the land. Solemn, and slow, with equal-measur'd feet, Six mourners bear him sighing to the fleet. The meantime Sheffie thus to Cowley spoke, Showing the monster devil in his look: âWith infant hell we've conflagrated heaven!â And fragment thunder on the foe have driven! âBut why did Churchill, reckless, why did he Excite the match and set the ruins free, Till we'd the danger fled? My sword no order gaveâ It might our army buried in the grave. A smiting rock apast my temples brush'dâ A host of royals by the blast was crush'd! âHark, to the shout! the bugle!âlist! the drum! They quicken into life!âthey comeâthey come!â âAway! why do we hesitate!âaway!â Bear you a flag, their progress to delay.â Go, check their forward marchâhearken!âthey come! Do you not hear the rattle of the drum? Capitulateâand strive with artful tongue To stay their march, while madden'd with the wrong,â Or till I enter in the senate hall, Loosen the scalpâor slaughter may befall The captur'd here! Their hearts must burn within, That on their heads we cast the magazine. But should they mark this scalp, Cawataw tore From Woolfork, massacred at Raisin's shore, 'Twould waken into life their smother'd ire, To wrap the splendour of the town in fire!â Cowley proceeds with floating banner white, To meet the columns moving in their might, While Sheffie hastens to the hall of state To seize the horrid trophyâsave from fate The kneeling capital. High o'er the mace It hangs suspendedâcivil man's disgrace! Sheffie arrivesâhe stretches forth his hand To loose the scalp from the retaining bandâ Behold, it quickens! drops fresh oozing blood, While the hair starting in an angry mood, Shoots particles of fire! Sheffie becomes Aghast with horrorâbut the approaching drums Vital his bloodâhe flies with panting breath And gains a thicketâhides himself from death. Cowley by this had met the conquering forceâ Saluted Ripley, and began discourse: âLo, I am charg'd to tender thee our peace, And in return, we crave a soldier's grace, Thou wilt not steel thy generous bosom hardâ Mercy administers its own reward. You'll scatter from your thoughts the magazineâ For that, by accident took fire within. We never could have thought the murderous deedâ Behold, ten fifties of our own fell dead! The British name is knownââ âYes: far too wellâ The name itself, seems partnership with hell! Moments are wasting. Soon at York shall I Have ample time to speak its infamy. âGive us the passing road!â âColumbians!ânow March with quick musick, that the soul may flow. Remember Pike's injunction on the plainâ âLet nothing dark our spotless honour stain.ââ Forth at the word, the patriots press the townâ The Lion humbled, with a groan sinks down. The Eagle soars upon triumphant wings, While from the soul, a shout through other rings! A thousand captives to the victors yield, And pile their bristling armour on the field. Ripley to Riddle thus: âYoung warrior, bear The lion standard to the navy there. Pike yet may live to fold it to his breast, Or on its Cross his dying head may rest. âTime offers now a respite from our toils. Hence, let our hunger banquet on the spoils; But first, to those surrender'd at our feet, Viands generous deal them,and the pulver'd wheat. 'Tis not against the helpless we contendâ A foe in battleâbut in peace a friend!â Riddle unpausing, moves towards the beachâ While others do, as saints to mortals teach; Then for their wearied natures they provide, And not their captives of their fate deride. Now Ripley, King, with other chiefs, withdraw T' observe the treasures conquer'd in the war. Soon they approach the legislative hallâ To mark its various workmanship they call. They view the cornice, pillars, form'd with graceâ But ken with scornful eye the kingly mace. âWhence is this blood?â (Thus King in heart despair,) âBehold the scalp!âWhat fiends these monsters are! Ice binds my heart. O sacrilege of heaven! To what death violence is Albion given! And do they bear the character of men, Who do such deeds as hell hath never seen! â'Tis not enough, the savage they employ To slay our virginsâour sweet babes destroy! 'Tis not enough, they massacre with fire, And drink our veins with horrible desire! 'Tis not enough, with slander's tongue to rave, And, on the ocean, fetter, scourge, and starve! 'Tis not enough, their magazines explode, And treacherous, murder in the coldest blood! Noânothing is enough! This scalp of hair, Must be suspended nakedâbleeding, bare!! Our brother's scalp! Brain-maddening, freezing thought! By gold, from hands of savage monsters bought! Who knows but that from Allen's head it came, Or Hickman's, Woolfork'sâtortur'd in the flame! âIs civil man more rank than savage beast? What racking thoughts convulse within my breast!â The prowling wolf the bleating lamb consumesâ His trembling prey the glutton panther dooms Instant to deathâbut from their shaggy hide, With ready tongues they lick the crimson tide! Noânot these prowlers of the desert wood, Can bear the recent stain of victims' blood; And shall the race of man? shall Albion's fame Be ever branded with the damning name? âO Hampden! Howard! characters of worth! Sidney! Russell!âdeign not to look on earth! Ye sad must weep, yea, weep hot tears in heaven, To view the blood to which your Country's given! Yeaâif on earth ye deign to bend an eye, That eye will stream the drops of agony! âMy soul speaks loud to set this hall on fireâ In empty ashes let the whole expire. My heart is bent to sweep it down amain, And let no shadow of its form remain.â A pausing deep ensu'd. The awful scene Palsied the tongue,âconvulsing every mien. Touch'd with despair they gaz'dâin reverie lost, As if before them stood a bleeding ghost! Ripley at length the solemn silence brokeâ Though mild his languageâtortur'd was his look: âMy corded heart is breaking on a strainâ Ice is lodg'd hereâit freezes with its pain. 'Tis bloodyâO 'tis horrible! but King, Let passion never 'tempt our hands to bring Grief on our fame. Inclin'd was I first, To ply the torch and level it to dust: But when more calmly I the deed survey, As though these columns in their ruins layâ Repentant we should grieveârevenge asideâ Shading the cause for which proud names have died. Noânever by our passions be subdu'd, And imitate the savages in blood. â'Tis not against the architecture's toil, Our arms make war, and in waste ruins spoil His great designs. Let arts and science standâ Pollute them not with sacrilegious hand. Such barbarous acts the Vandals would disgraceâ Then, what dishonour to Columbian race, Where Freedom flourishes and Science lives, Which from the nation fostering care receives. No: let our hearts the dying Pike revere, And save this splendour from the torch severe. Remove the scalpâconsign it to its earthâ 'Twill speak the British name, and show our greater worth.â Without dissent, to Ripley they subscribe, And all the honour of his soul imbibe. As his full eye reveal'd a tear-drop bright, Ripley assay'd to move it from the light, Still fresh with oozing blood! Lo, as his hand Loosen'd the complex doublings of the band, It ceas'd to sparkle fire and drop its gore, As though the touch were some superior power! The chiefs return with bosoms heaving sighs, As closing night rolls heavy from the skies. During these passing incidents, MacClure Convey'd the dying Pike with sorrow pure, Down to the beach. Partial his eyelids clos'd, And veil'd the sight from heaven, but yet expos'd A circle ghastly wan. Lo, now the roar Of vict'ry swells and thunders to the shore! Quick his eye opens with a brilliance bright, Through which his soul comes waken'd into light! The rose supplants the lily in his cheekâ But ah, his palsied tongue denies to speakâ A dying smile is seenâa lucid tear Melts in his eye, revealing what was near. âThankââGodâhe would have saidâAlas, too weak His stammering tongue another word to speak. His bosom sinks with a resigning sighâ His colour palesâhalf closes up his eye. On board the Pert, him tender they convey, At anchor riding in the silver bay. Chauncey stands drooping by the side of Brown, And Dearborn grac'd with honourable renownâ While o'er their cheeks the trickling tears stream down, The hero wandering in a dying swoon, His pulse faint beating, slow with death's dull tune. Thus when to shroud in earth some far-farm'd chief, The muffled drum sad strikes the note of griefâ Now, widow'd, slow,âremote,âone sound aloneâ Another,âpausingâwith a solemn tone Comes long and deepâand then, with thickening beat, They run together with disorder'd feet: So his pulse strikes with intermitting play, Fluttering and pausing as he melts away. Lo, Riddle now on board the ship arrives With Albion's flag! The dying Pike revives! A holy brightness quickens in his eye, As when through clouds a star illumes the sky! His soul, as though from sleep's soft arms again Smiling awakes! His features touch'd with pain, Give beauty to his cheek. No word he said,â But laid his cold hand soft beneath his head, Then pointed to the standard!â Riddle knew His dying purpose, and towards him drew The conquer'd banner, furl'd, and tender laid The Albion Cross beneath his dying head! He glowsâhe smiles! two tear-drops bathe his eyesâ They close,âhe faints,âhe gasps,âhe sinks,âhe dies. Mortals! behold his spirit on the wingâ Divine in beautyâan immortal thing! Like a young dove exultingly she fliesâ Yet for a moment, lingers from the skies To take one look of the exalted clay, That barr'd her freedom from celestial day! She winds her flight to heaven! What charms unfold! Her plumes are waving in a flood of gold! Fredonia joins the uncag'd Spirit free, To bear it heavenward with her company. As bless'd they mount upon exulting wings, This anthem sweet, th' empyreal Goddess sings: âMortals! mourn not!âlo, Pike my chosen son, To fields ambrosial, in his pride hath gone! Rejoice in heaven! behold, with joy I come To bear a lofty Spirit to its home! Time may decay, but, crown'd with hallow'd fame, Pike will endure through earth, through heaven the same!â CANTO XXIII. BURIAL OF GENERAL PIKE AND DEFENCE OF SACKETT'S HARBOUR. ARGUMENT. The Burial of General Pike ... The British Fleet in sight of Sackett's Harbour .... The circumstance of boats descending from Oswego .... The Defence of the Harbour. The sceneâLittle York, Kingston, Lake Ontario, and Sackett's Harbour .... The time is about five days: commencing at the period of Pike's leaving the Harbour for York, and concluding on the day succeeding his funeral. A sacred influence held the gazers dumb, When Pike expir'd with smiling on the tomb. The spheres in musick, melting on their breast, Dissolv'd their anguish in the balm of rest:â A hope delicious echo'd in the strain, Which, like a holy unction, sooth'd their pain: So tender poppies at the day newborn, Weighted with dew, hang down their heads and mournâ But when the sun unloads the liquid pearl, They, fresh with beauty, to the light unfurl: From willow'd sorrow thus they rose,âand smil'dâ Their up-rais'd eye with heavenly rapture fill'd. At length, to those in group upon the Pert, Brown gave instructionsâsouls of high desert: Chauncey, supreme upon the lakeâand then, His nephew, new in arms, but rank'd with menâ And Brown, his brother's sonâand Adams fair, In years both equal, with an open air. Chauncey, the nephew, rules the Pertâand Brown, The Lady-of-the Lake to gain renownâ The Fair American, the vessel's name That Adams guides, to give his worth acclaim. And Morgan, Riddle, stand upon the barque, To hear what Brown in sorrow would remark: âHow wonderful he pass'd from earth to heaven! A full fruition to his soul is given. His heart was finest gold,âof mortals firstâ And we with honour must entomb his dust. âAdams, the wounded in your vessel take, And bear them o'er the bosom of the lake. Our largest grief was by the magazineâ How small our loss had not that treachery been! âRiddle, return and this my purpose say To Ripley, that in rest his warriors stay, Till from the grave of valour I returnâ Which I shall hasten, when I place the urn O'er this sublime mortalityâto strike The Fort of Georgeâand do, or fall, as Pike. âMy brother's elder son, in Lady sail, And to Niagara bear the passing tale, And what our brief intentions. Morgan, you With rifle band will guard him from the foe. âChauncey, your naval armament provide With ample means the action to abide; And, while I'm absent on the solemn tour, Guard well the purposes of Yeo's powerâ For in the breeze we mark'd his banner high, As evening shades were closing on the sky. Your nephew now will in the Pert with me Convey the relicks o'er the crystal sea.â The potent Chauncey, when his words were done, Forsook the Pert and gain'd the Madison. Riddle, the scout of armies, made to land, To speak to Ripley to refresh his band. Young Brown, the sea-youth, in the Lady sails To fort Niagara with inviting gales. Morgan embark'd, as Brown the chief had told, To guard his passage with his rifles bold, Against the cruising ships of Yeo far, Intent to quench the beams of Freedom's Star. Adams, on board American the Fair, Receives the pallid-maim'd with soothing careâ Of whom is Fanning with contusive wound, Caus'd by a rock recoiling from the ground, Young Chauncey of the Pert his anchor weighsâ And Adams follows on the inland seas. Their half-rais'd flags the sign of death display, As slow they wind in sorrow from the bay. O how delicious is the evening beam, Steeping the fancy in elysian dream! Behind the western cliffs the sun decays, To heaven the soul attracting with his rays! As soft on Ocean's lap he leans his head, He paints the clouds with purple, gold, and red, Rearing their fleecy brows with grandeur high, Like shaggy rocks rough-pointing up the sky, Edg'd round with rainbows, orange, azure, green, And all the colours that in heaven are seen. Light, in the mirror flood, the shadows move Of rocks, hills, clouds, and angel forms above. With breathing lips the Zephyrs kiss the lakeâ The sleeping shadows in the waters wake And dance, delightedâhand in hand they go, Till the last day beams on the mountains show. As down the west the evening gold decays, The queen of heaven her silver robe displays. Smooth as she climbs the elements above, The stars in loveliness around her move. Lo, as Pike slumbers in the arms of death, Fredonia comes, and with ambrosial breath Breathes on his cold, wan cheek,âthen flings a shower Of holy dew, collected from the bower, Shading the hill of heaven. A wonder strange! The marble deathness of his features change! The full-blown roses of his cheeks revive, So perfect to the life they seem to live! Thus pale and drooping hangs a wither'd flower, Sear'd by the scorching of the noontide hourâ But lo, the moisture and the breath of even Revive its tints, as dipt in dyes of heaven. With solemn movement, smooth the vessels sail, Impell'd with sadness by the sighing gale. When day returns it gleams with sickly lightâ Remote the Harbour looms upon the sight. From Pert, the guns in measur'd minutes roar, Bearing the grief, appalling, round the shore. Backus was form'd in column on the ground, When the brass thunders bore the heavy sound With death-note echo, mourning from their tongue,â Broken,âheart-sinking, lumbering slow and long. âList! Hark! the measur'd noteâthe note of death! Some fallen hero asks a tomb beneath. Behold, two vessels on the lake are nigh, With drooping banners weeping through the sky! Sad, I forebode 'tis Ripley, Forsythe, Brownâ King, Pike, or Chaunceyâforemost in renown. O let us haste and meet them at the wave, To bear with solemn march the warrior to his grave.â They heard in silence with their souls in grief, And move with sorrow's tread to meet the lifeless chief. By this, in harbour have the vessels moor'd, Though still the guns their deep affliction pour'd. Brown waves his handâso full his loaded breast, It chokes his tongue to utter the behest. The speaking sign the mariners obeyâ Deep-aw'd, Pike's dust they to the barge convey. At thirty second's pause they dip the oar, Which moves the yawl with deadness to the shore. Brown fills the sternâbent, leaning on his swordâ Sighs heave his bosom, but no voice is heard,â All drooping sad. The death-barge travels slow, Sunk in the wave,âdepress'd with leaden wo, Sighing itself along. The waves grow dark, Though ting'd with sable, as they bear the bark, Groaning with sorrow's weight: At length they reach The gazing shore, and gather on the beach. When Backus and his column mark'd their chief Stretch'd on the bier, their tears proclaim'd their grief. As bend the yielding willows to the plain, When bath'd in summer with a dash of rainâ So stood they weeping with dependent head, As though their hearts were in their bosoms dead. And now, the matrons resident in town, With trembling, hurry to the sand-beach down, To learn whose guardian of their hearts had fledâ Who of the earth had made his funeral bedâ Each apprehending with a shivering pain, Her soul's affection in the battle slainâ âMy husband!âis it he!â Exclaim'd his wifeâ And sunk upon his dust bereft of life. Her heart gave backâshe fainted long awayâ Her arms like death convuls'd upon his clay. At length, her heart faint flutter'd in her breastâ She breath'dâshort, panting with her soul oppress'd: âWhat dizzy darkness swims before mine eyesâ How coldâhow dead my bosom-angel lies! It never, cannot be. Montgomery, speak! A quickening smile seems moving on thy cheek! That rose must bloom from life!â'tis trancing sleepâ Waken, my loveâmy bosom trembles deep!â âAlas, thou art no more!âor my warm kiss Had broke thy slumber to return the bliss. Coldâicy-coldâ âHe's goneâmy all is gone! My heart is rentâmy hopeâmy life is done! âHow often hath that eye made glad my soulâ Clos'dâclos'd in death! no more on me to roll! And will these hallow'd lips no more wed mine? No more these arms about my neck entwine? Will not these features smile the smile of joy To hear the prattle of our infant boy?â Neverâno never will he charm thine ear!â Is my Montgomery gone, and left me widow'd here? O never can it beâmy lifeâmy all! Awake, my love!â'tis thy Clarissa's callâ Her arms embrace thee. O, one parting look! âCold is thy bosomâcoldââ Dead,âfainting on his clay, Again she fell, and sigh'd her soul away. The females pour a sympathetick tear, And raise her gently from the warrior's bier. An easy carriage bears her to her home, Where she revives, and faints, by grief o'ercome. And when the musick of her heart she gains, A wild delirium siezes on her brainsâ Talks of her husbandâmuttering all aloneâ And each long pause is broken with a groan. Without the accent of a breathing loud, In the dark coffin they the warrior shroud. List!âthe deep tone of hollow-sounding drum Gives notice solemn, to his grave they come, Fresh open'd on the hill, damp, cold, and deep, Whilst on its edge is laid the dark brown heap, Impressive to the heart,âto shut the scene, When in its womb shall sleep the first of men. At every pausing note the musick play, The warrior's hearts sigh broken on the way. Sad breathes the fifeâthe muffled drum strikes deadâ With mourning step delay'd, the measur'd time they tread. His naked sword gleams icy on the pall, Like Death's pale finger on Belshazzar's wall. They reach the grave, and compass it aroundâ The drum no longer tones the sinking sound. On arms revers'd, they lean their foreheads bare, While not a breathing floats upon the air. To four sage warriors, Backus makes the sign To sink the coffin with the funeral line. Soft they approach, and raise the pall and swordâ Then, through the ringlets run the doubling cord. This done,âthey raise itâand its form adjust, Fitting the chamber ere they lower the dustâ Slow, cautious, deep, they sink it in the earth, Where all must dwell who breathe of mortal birth. This doneâthey cast the up-thrown pile beneath, Which wakes the voice of hollow-sounding death, Cold, freezing every heartâthe warriors raise Their leaning heads, and look with frenzied gaze. What time they arch and sod the hero's bed, Brown, sighing with his grief, this language said, Half brightening through his tears: âWe've here enshrin'd Relicks as pure as ever wrapp'd the mind, Moulded by Deity. The Banner'd Star Kindled his soul to meet the foe in war; Yet, though he madden'd in the strife of arms, Peace gave his heart the sweetness of her charms. The soldier, patriot, husband, father, friend, In him were blendedâhence, will he descend To distant ages with a memory pure, While the bless'd name of virtue shall endure. âBut now, 'tis time to put away the sighâ The grave is common to mortality. It consecrates the heart to drop a tear, When worth lies shrouded on the funeral bier; But grief excessive shows a failing mindâ The voice of wisdom bids us be resign'd. âThe tomb our bodies must receive in turn, Hence, o'er his dust let farewell vollies burnâ The drums unmuffleâlet the standards float Light to the motion of forgetful note.â They dried their tears, and blaz'd the honour'd roundsâ Instant new musick from the drums rebounds; Their sighs are lost amid the clear notes shrillâ With banners streaming they descend the hill. Nor brier, nor nettle, mars the hallow'd spot, Where, grav'd in earth, Pike's holy ashes rotâ But there, the sweetest flowers delight to grow, The primrose, lily, and the drops of snow; At each bright morn they weep upon his tomb, And scatter round a waste of rich perfume. What time that Chauncey from the Harbour bore His fleet with Pike to land upon the shore, And conquer YorkâYeo beheld his sails, And back to Kingston flew before the gales. He came at eveningâshelter'd from the wind, And thus to Prevostâconfident in mind: âGovernor supreme! worthy the royal style! What now I speak will cause thy brow to smile. âLo, I at rising sun the foe descried, Embark'd and dashing westward through the tide. Perhaps at York a blow they meditateâ But Sheffie soon will them annihilate. âNow to my purpose should your views incline, I think we'll carry on a bold design, Which is no other than their port to strikeâ While Brown is absent, Forsythe, Ripley, Pike. To us 'tis offer'd now their strength to break, And rule uncheck'd the circle of the lake. âPrudence forewarns not to approach their fleet, Till we shall damp its violence of heat. Their ships enrag'd are fatal in their wrath, Hence, for our safety, we must shun their pathâ But in its weakness we can smite the town, And bend its haughty standard to the crown.â Prevost impatient listen'd while he spoke, And thus, as though the Freedom power he'd broke: âThe thought is gloriously conceiv'dâ'tis greatâ We'll forth proceedâthe village desolate. We'll wing us o'er the flood and snatch the prize, And wrench the haughty Eagle from the skies. The town will kneelâbeseech of us its lifeâ Noneânone will dare t' oppose us in the strife. 'Twill be to us a pleasant interludeâ âWe waste the time to navigate the flood. Your barges man to take the troops on board, While I to them shall speak the gladdening word.â Yeo in fulness of his hope withdrew T' arrange the barges, vessels, and his crew, Whilst Prevost bounded where his cohorts stood, And thus with vaunting speech: âWheel to the flood! Embark the navy, ready to awayâ Behold, we triumph on the coming day! Their port will be our future residenceâ Our flag will wave upon its eminence! As Vincent smote them at the Queenstown Rock, And gave them slaughter for the death of Brock, So now shall we with retribution strikeâ Lo, Brown is absent on the lake with Pike!â The Albions wheel upon the line of marchâ Reaching the shore, they form a crimson arch, Wideâbending with the floodâwhich shows the same Reflectedâlike the bow of heavenly name. The ready yawls convey them to the fleet With all the furniture of death complete, Crowding the ample ships: Wolfe, Regent, Earl, Whose cloud-aspiring masts the Cross unfurlâ And lesser namesâdeep sunk with mortars large, Besides a battle-ship, the Royal George. Walch, Haynes, and Moody, Newellâfifty more Compose the leaders to conduct the power. But Gray, the generous warrior, stands aloneâ A gem of honour to the English throne. How sad the Muse regrets so few to find Of Albion chiefs endow'd with noble mind! Impartial Britons!âpoint the man of fame, Whom I unworthy have traduc'd his nameâ His name shall be redeem'd, unspotted, brightâ A star sweet beaming through the clouds of nightâ Distrust me notâit makes my bosom bleed, To find so few deserving virtuous meed. Their characters are so begrim'd with wrong, They stain the honour of the epick song. Now in their place, the ready seamen stand To loose the grappling anchors at command; But as that Yeo was about to say: âThe moon-bent fastenings from the deep rocks weigh!â The fickle breezes from the south veer'd round, And fast in port th' impatient navy bound. But when the morning rose with pallid beam, That Brown return'd from o'er the crystal stream To grave the dust of Pikeâthe north gales blew With infant breath to suit the royal view. They spread their sails to catch the flickering windâ Which fill'd and bore them on their course design'd. The sun at noon, the Harbour they descryâ The towering steeples pointing up the sky. Th' alluring prospect animates their breast To wrench the Eagle from her air-built nest. Now when that Chauncey and young Adams fair, Had fill'd with mournful sound the sorrowing air, They cast their anchors off the Harbour deep, In sight the passing enemy to keep. Chauncey was first to mark them in the north, Like loose clouds floating level with the earth. âExplode the signal guns! Behold them rise Successive into view, where waves and skies Kissingly unite!â Words were useless more, For even now the alarming cannon roarâ The lumbering echo hurries to the fort, Which soon outswells the navy in report. The patriots, instant they receiv'd the sound, Sought their bold chieftain in their baldricks bound, From which their swords hung ready at a leap To break their prisonâroyal heads to sweep. BackusâMills next, the battle lines to ruleâ Then Lavalle, Aspinwall, of equal soul. Stone left the fortress in the care of West, To do as Brown his will should manifest. âWarriors, your promptness at the brief alarm Bespeaks you ready in the cause to arm, And shows the beatings of your bosoms warm. âWith sands of gold the moments vanishâMills, Supported with your aids, scour plains and hills, And let your voice be echo'd through the night, For volunteers their country to requite. Stone, to the fortress presently repair, And keep reserv'd its ready thunders there, Till second flame the infantry shall pour, Then let the foe be deafen'd with their roar. The only passage open from the lake Is at the Islandâpossible to take, Hence, Backus, thither lead your banded power, And raise a bulwark to defend the shore.â Mills mountedâplied the spurâand dashing rode To rouse the culturers of the soil to bloodâ Stone to the fortâand Backus with his men, Whose eye of valour is an Eagle's ken.â Lavalle the patriot, Aspinwall, and Brown, Unite their powers to fortify the town. Now, when the ships exploded the alarms, Oswego rose and seiz'd upon their arms. MacNitt the honour had to rule the vanâ Barges nineteen, his active warriors man. Soon, foaming o'er the waters, he descries A squadron to defeat his enterprise. Prevost on Newell had bestow'd command To take, or sink them, ere they struck the land. MacNitt, with mind not readily subdu'd, Rapid proclaims to stretch along the flood: âQuicken the stroke and strong with breathing row! Behold, they come our strength to overthrow! Lash into spray the bosom of the wave! Turn yonder point, and strive the arms to save. Let nothing look behindâbut dash the oarâ Or make the port, or run upon the shore.â Each word was like a coal upon their heart; Like wings of swallows, swift the oar-blades dartâ The Albions in pursuitâwho, furious brush The waves with foaming strokesâand driving rush, And intercept the rearâbut, with quick turn, Dashing so fleet, the barges smoking burn Beneath the frictive oarsâhaply they landâ Their vacant yawls remain with Newell's band. Ten with MacNitt, by darting motion reach The Harbour's shore and bound upon the beach. Newell returns rejoicing in his pride, His recent trophies gliding by his side. With empty pomp he passes round the fleetâ Him Prevost hails as vict'ry were complete: âKnighthood is thine!ânine conquer'd at a blow! This is the prelude to their overthrow! âA thought has flash'd upon my brainâindeed Suddenâbut yet the method will succeed. Hear it, Sir James! From this your anchors weigh, And bear the navy to the Southern Bayâ Then will I forth with Newell, an adept, And from Oswego barges interceptâ It cannot be but other bands from thence, Are hastening down to give their flag defence.â Thus spake Sir Georgeâand thus began Sir James, Such gaudy titles flutter round their namesâ A monarch's art to fill an empty skull, And make the vacant idiot more a fool. âBalanc'd have I the weight of your discourseâ My judgment tells me 'twill impair our force. I fear we lose our purpose by delay, For which your captures never would repay: 'Twill give them needful leisure to prepare With ample bulwarks to defy us there. âShould I adviseâat once I'd strike the shore, Ere abler strength was added to their power. Do you not hear their 'larum guns resound To call their forces from the country round? Hence, would I make the sudden descent now, Ere they by numbers could resist the blow.â âIn this, I apprehend your judgment wrongâ Small parts deducted will make weak the strong. The effort will succeedâeach freighted boat Will yield successive, as we onward float. Thus, while the fleet at anchor rides at ease, We'll waste their strength and bend them by degrees. âDread you their power? If we indeed must fight, Let all their forces to a point unite. Will not our veterans, prov'd invincible, Their proudest efforts in submission quell?â Yeo observ'd him on his purpose bent, And said no more to hinder the event. But weigh'd and set his compass for the Bay, While Prevost plann'd arrangements on the way. How oft the dancing of a feather saves The proudest nations from impending graves! How oft the happiness of man is made By the mere passing of a transient shade! How oft doth agony that burns the blood Direct the soul to some substantial good! Had not MacNitt sustain'd a partial loss, By this, had wav'd on high the royal Crossâ But by a circumstanceâa fractionâyet The Eagle floats upon the parapet! The regal barges being mann'd with power, Cautious proceed along the winding shore. Smooth on they glide, their oars in measur'd sweep, Like flocks of sea-fowl sculling through the deep. Now when Fredonia on preceding even, Had bath'd the cheek of Pike in dew of heaven, She fled the earth, and spent the night above, Reclining soft on flowers perfum'd with love. At noon the Goddess in her beauty came With Vict'ry on her rightâher left was Fame, And stood on heaven's battlementâdiamond stone, Whose pure effulgence would make dark the sun. To earth she bent her eyes of azure bright, Like newborn stars that roll in seas of light, And mark'd with grief the feeble arm of Brown, Back to recoil th' invasion from the townâ The barge-boat squadron blackening up the lakeâ After brief pausing, with a smile she spake: âOntario calls us forth:âthe time is now, Swift to descend and circumvent the foe. Observe what numbers darken o'er the lake, Searching with jealous eye the brave to seekâ But empty nothing's thereâyet still must we Delude their fancy on the crystal sea, Till Brown with abler means shall stand prepar'd Against pollution of the sail to guard. âBehold yon silver mist that lines the north! Thither we'll dart invisibleâand forth, Within its spongy folds the fleet involve, That they no object may distinctly solve.â Swift on three arrows of descending light, They glance to earth from the empyreal height. Soft on the bosom of the cloud they sail,â And with their wings, by fanning of the gale, They bear the volume of thin mist away, Which by degrees obscures Ontario sea, Surrounding objects scattering from the eye, Save what the brain creates in vacancy. This doneâFredonia from her bosom breathes, And of her breath a various rainbow weaves; On which, like things of heaven th' empyreals rideâ Th' obscuring cloud remaining on the tide. The Britons presently, delusive view Barges descending with a numerous crew. Prevost beholds, and in his pride exclaims: âLook! they approach! This proves my thoughts not dreams! Did not my wisdom their descent foresee? Thus we by parts will waste their strength away. âNewell, incline to land with balanc'd oars, Should they attemptâto bar them from the shores, While I a compass on the waters take, That none may dart beyond us on the lake; When, thus environ'd, must their standard fallâ We strike with steel, nor trust th' uncertain ball.â Newell breaks off, and glides along the shore, While Prevost circles with an even oar, Arching the waters deep:âlike crescent moon The shadows they surround. And Prevost soon Thus cast his voice away: âDespair and yield! Supreme, I rule upon the lake and field! Reverse your standardâstrike it from the sunâ A word, a breathâand lo, your lives are done! Hope to the winds dismissâin vain to flyâ Make but the motion, presently you die! What, mock the gestures of my lifted sword? This sword is death! Surrender at the word! What, dare you still my rising arm to mock? The power is mine, your every breath to lock! Bend to the knee! I feel my mercy spentâ The bayonet-spear will through your hearts be sent! What, do your standards flout at my decree? RushâAlbions, rushâand prove their destiny!â The squadron forward dash'd with steel in hand, To gain a conquest of the airy band. Prevost in front, and Newell on their rear, Leading the onset with a lifted spear. Lo, in the time that lightning cuts the sky, The phantoms vanish'd into vacancy! A new position, opposite they stood, A solid cube condens'd upon the flood. So when the sun in his careering way Illumes with amber light the silver spray, Curling in wreaths from vast Niagara deep, Whose constant thunders bellow Earth to sleepâ Fantastick rainbows dance with lucid sheen Mixing soft beauty with the awful sceneâ The stranger marks them in their wanton playâ He movesâbehold they vanish into spray. Curious of mind, he takes a different stand,â Another group, delighted hand in hand, Comes leaping into life on golden feet, Touch'd with the wonder of enchantment sweet. Like these, elusively the shadows fled, And on the lake a new position made. Prevost in madness tore upon his hair: âDashâplunge, destroy themâwhat directionâwhere? Whither have they vanish'd? âNewell, explain, Wherefore have they pass'd, and nothing slain? To you 'twas given to bar them from the shore,â Your loss is larger than your gain before. Confusion, whatââ His pride so keen was stung, He bit to rest the censure of his tongue. âMy fame is tarnish'd not,â Newell rejoins. âBold I aver, they never press'd my lines. My barges stand unalter'd in their curveâ No touch we felt to jar upon the nerve. We thought indeed, your circle was in faultâ To us it seem'd you broke at the assault. Their rapidness I sawâ âBehold them now! Too fast thy passionâsmooth away thy brow. Marshall'd in cubeâdeep-wedg'd in solid form, Their falchions gleaming, daring us to storm!â âCan it be so? My anger was too fastâ We'll now effect them with a leaden blast. No more we'll make endeavours with the brand, For fear they'd fly the slowness of our hand. But they in speed must imitate the light T' outstrip the motion of the bullet's flight. Display the barge-line in a spacious curve, That when I speak, each arms his death may serve.â The watermen, as he the mandate gave, In a broad crescent arch'd upon the waveâ And Prevost thus again: âWe'll blot their nameâ They melt before us in a shower of flame. With idiot gaze they look upon their fall! Destruction waits upon their funeral! The steel batter with flint!â Vaunting he spokeâ Forthwith the curve was wrapp'd in flame and smoke, Through the strange element sharp sung the lead Like hail-drops driven by the lightning dread. But lo, the wonder!ânone are seen to die! The smoke augments the spectre imagery! More, and more violent the flashes growâ Near, and more near press on their shadowy foe! With seeming anger they portend the dart! A sudden horror siezes every heartâ Palsied, they drop their armsâdisorder'd break, And fly like wild things scatter'd o'er the lake. So when, beneath the moon's inviting ray, Rude boys blaspheming bent upon their play, Heed not a thickening of the cloud of night, Till swift it comes and smothers up the light! Amaz'd they startleâchill'd with horror cold, While in their bosoms with a press they hold Their light-pent breathingâhuddling in a crowd, They look towards the moon and mark the cloud, Which soon their fancies image to the form Of some dark spirit of the midnight storm. Their terrors thicken as they view the skiesâ Like open graves appear its hollow eyes! They shriekâand scattering in their panick fly, Not daring to revert a backward eye: Thus smit with sudden fear, the Albions break, And drive like unchain'd frenzy o'er the lake. Each seems to each the image of a sprite, More hideous shapen as descends the night. Yet still pursu'd by wonder-working spell, They think they see the horrid things of hell! Not otherwise, a traveller spent with toil Through a long day beneath the sun's hot broil, Reclines at night to lose himself in restâ But latent fever stirring in his breast, Propels his blood in hurry through his veins, Which wakes the sleeping tenants of the brainsâ Grim shapes and shadows horrible appear, Which hold him spell-bound in the gripe of fearâ The more he labours to avoid the dream, The more terrifick in their looks thy seem: Like this, the misty spectres of the flood, Pursue the foe, till frosted seems their blood, The more they labour from the scene to fly, More dire the shades their bosoms terrify. What time these scenes upon the lake transpir'd, Brown, Backus, Aspinwall, one impulse fir'd To sink the trench and raise the bulwark moundâ And soon the passage with defence was bound. Now as the moon descending in his place, Bathes in blue ocean her empyreal face, Mills, with battalions to the Harbour comesâ Brief, when was hush'd the musick of the drums, Brown he salutes, and thus: âGreat was my fear, Ere this the foe had desolated here. âThese now, which I surrender up to thee, Aver they'll die for Freedom valiantly, Or beat th' invaders hence. Our station planâ We'll prove our courage worthy of the van.â Brown approbating thus: âScarce hath the watch, The fourth from twelve wound up,âyour swift despatch Merits the meed of praise. When danger crowds, A brittle moment elevates or shrouds The hope of nationsâcharacters of menâ So fleet the changes of this changing scene. Thy swift return its future fame will find; It proves thy country lives upon thy mind.â This said,âin centre of the band he rode, And strong in faith their place defensive show'd: âSoldiers! I feel that none will disregard, What each in honour valiant hath declar'd. Fix'd be your souls upon the trial day, That no pale thought your purpose shall dismay. Fame is your birthrightâLet deep anger's brow Cast back defiance on th' invading foe. Heed not their haughty portâthis bulwark strong Will be your safety 'gainst th' opposing throng. The lead keep sleeping till you well can spy The pearly white that compasses their eye. Ere thrice your arms explode, the fort will burst, And them reduce to elemental dust.â Brown ended his address. The band replied: âTill death shall come the foe shall be defied!â No more was pass'd. Brown's order they obey'd, Led forth by Millsâa soul for battle made. While deep in thought the village to defend, To Backus, Brown, familiar like a friend: âPrudence forbids us on these troops to rest, Though stand they shielded with a wall'd-up breast, They show like those that shrunk from Rensselaerâ He lost the fight by their unmanly fear,â Hence, be it thine to stand upon reserve, Should these prove dastard and from honour swerve, With choice battalions, first to drive the ball, Lavalle detach, and gallant Aspinwallâ Should those with Mills in weakness fly the storm, My sword will strive their breaking to reform.â When Brown in friendship's ear his thoughts express'd, Backus perform'd with promptness the behestâ Lavalle display'd upon the village road, And Aspinwall to standâattack the crowd Of Albion's dark arrayâand then combine And brave his strength to curb th' invading line. The whole was plann'd and ready for the fight, As eastern clouds made manifest the light. Gone is the visionary cloud, that lost Forlorn upon the lake the royal host. Drifting unknown, they from their wild dreams wake, And scarce conceive what brought them on the lake. At length, when morning partially was seen, They rose with care depictur'd in their mienâ As Venus veil'd her gold, the last bright star, They join'd their navy at the Southern bar. The cheek of Prevost still retain'd its dread, And thus to Yeo he with wildness said: âHell hath disgorg'd its tenants! Yea, I fear That fiends in riot hold their orgies here! Death's arrows seem my bosom to transfixâ No other this, than the infernal Styx! Methinks I even now behold the flames! Had we not better cross the lake, Sir James?â âRecross the lake! renounce our purposeâhow? I'll never more raise flag against a foe! Away the thoughtâoutroot it from your breast,â Let the past night in deep oblivion rest. Though I at first was urgent to proceed, And gain a knighthood by the splendid deed, Yet my soul stands in every thought as sure, That we shall make the victory secure. Admit their energies are stronger now, Still we with ease their strength can overthrow; Yet oft they stand and disregard the storm, And breast the danger in its blackest form: York, Sheffie hath surrender'd. Late at night, Heard I that Proctor in a panick flight Fled from Sanduskyâbeaten by a boy!â Hence, we to conquer, must our powers employ; Wipe from our royalty this darkening stain, Or strike our flags and yield like dastards mean.â Prevost had now his countenance acquir'd, And thus he answer'd with new feelings sir'd: âThe past is but a dream. By proof you know, My heart was ever ready for the foe. I'll order the descent!âand instant then, Illume this darkness with the deeds of men! We'll be the first to turn this ebbing tideâ Yea, be the stars to light the path of pride. My sword will I unsheath, and impulse give To future actions and the fame receive! He, who is first to stay the waves of grief, Is ever hail'd the most exalted chief. âOur breath consumes the moments! Barclay there, On Erie's flood, may that proud honour bear! I feel a something stirring in my breast, Ere noon we desolate the Eagle's nest. âYour grappling anchors elevate awayâ Renounce the waters of this wizard bay, And sail and drop them in the Harbour fast, That raining fire may on the town be cast.â Yeo the order echo'd in his pride; The loosen'd navy tilts upon the tide. In rapid time it reach'd the destin'd wave, And Prevost signal for the action gave: âBehold, the object of our fame is nigh! Prepare to seize it, or in striving, die! Gray, draw thy falchionâlead the Lion band, And clear the bulwark-passage of the land. Haynes, Evans, Moody, Newell,âGray assist To storm the town and scatter them as mist. With me, reserv'd, will be our strength combin'd To rush their ranks, and scatter them as wind Up-tosses to the heavens the empty dustâ Knighthood is his, who strikes the shore the first!â Fill'd are th' invading bargesâforth they proceedâ Gray, fearless in the van, to do the deed. Haynes, Moody, Evans, on his rear pursue, Whose eye unalter'd shows their valour true. Next, Prevost follows with a crimson band, And sets a signal where the front should land. Then Yeo's deep-drove battering-guns are seen To cover the descentâa thousand men. Their crowded numbers overshade the lakeâ And soon the violence of armies break. When Mills beheld them gathering on his sight, His heart in rapid pulses beat for fight. âBehold invasion darkening on the wave! Nowânow 'tis given to prove what souls ye have! This, this the hour to give your memories fameâ See, how they open with a harmless flame! No ball assails usânone,âclose eye the bead, That every lead may make a royal bleed. Be not impatientâsee you mark the white That lines the eyeball, ere you flash the light. âLo, they approach! The time of death has come! Aim till truth talliesâStrike them to the tomb!â The ready lock-springs at the word they drawâ Flames leap with madness from the tubes of war. The Albions reel and struggle in their bloodâ Haynes, Moodyâfallâare hurried in the flood. Two bubbles rise upon the surface soon, Which prov'd their hearts had beat their final tune. âTh' effort quick repeat!â Mills with burning eyeâ âBehold, disorder'd dies the enemy! Be in your hearts as hunters bent for deerâ Pour but another round and we the fort shall hear!â Encourag'd thus, again they cast the fireâ Again the Albions tremble and expire. The Fiend approach'dâand to effect his hell, Thunder'd aloudâ(his form invisibleâ) As though an army on their rear had come With rushing force their being to consume! Their hearts feel deathâthey shriek, they break, they flee, And leave the passage to th' invaders free! Their frenzy maddening as they onward fare, Their every eyeball smitten with despair. âWhy dastard are ye thus?âwhence these alarms?â (Mills breaking at his heart.) To armsâto arms! What, will you leave me in the field alone? Standâwheelârush bayonet!âevery fear atone! Have ye not pledg'd your life against the foe? This noise comes empty from yon clouded brow. Think, when ye stood, what names in blood sunk down! Turn and retrieve your character's renown. Resist th' invasionâbreak itâor disgrace Will brand like infamyâthe stain efface! A thousand, thousand deaths I'd rather die, Than turn, and meanly like a dastard fly. It neverâcannot be!âyour honour saveâ And can we ever sleep in softer grave? A couch of immortality! how soft!ââ Alas! what circumstance hath still'd his tongue? He falls to earth with every nerve unstrung! Round as he wav'd his sword to stay their fear, The bullet enter'd opposite his earâ Glanc'd from the casement of the brain within, And tore its passage through the forehead skin. His soul comes floating with the brains and goreâ Stiff roll his eyesâthey closeâto wake no more! What though thy body moulders back to clay, Yet never, Mills! thy name shall see decay. Worms may devour thy fleshâthy bones may rot, But thou shalt live till virtue is forgot. His frighted cohorts mark'd his pouring blood, And at the sight, dash'd wilder to the wood: So, when a tree, dissever'd by a gust, Smites the plough'd earth, whence rolls a cloud of dust, Young steeds unbroken, grazing in the vale, Hearâand with crouching show their hearts to quail; A moment, lo, they scamper o'er the plains, Their heads high-toss'd in airâtheir flowing manes Riding the blast. A springing hare alarms, And drives them sweeping round the neighbouring farms. The swain's once well-known voice is known no moreâ The more he calls, more wild they bounding leap the hills and vallies o'er: Thus flew the panick train; their chief's proud tongue Urging their stay, but drove them pale along. When earth receiv'd him, their excited fear Trifold increas'dâthey fled like hound-chas'd deer. âAnd shall his blood be lost?â (exclaim'd MacNitt, Striving with strength to break their coward fit.) âBehold, and quicken at the sight! O shame! Let sudden vengeance every heart inflame! And shall we leave his bleeding body there? Spurn at the thought! On!âwith the patriots share The glorious toil! See, Backus mows them down! Onâlet us onâand struggle for renown!â Twice fifty hearken to his voice and stand, Sham'd that they'd fled the passage of the land. Their tongues are lock'd in silenceâdeep they close To wipe the stainâthe flying from their foes. MacNitt advanc'dâbut halted on the green, For lo, approaching was the chieftain seen. When Brown beheld the volunteers retire, His soul indignant burnt with anger's fire. He rode, like meteor coursing o'er the night, To bring them back to vindicate the fight. He found MacNitt progress'd beyond the woodâ Forth he address'd the warriors as they stood: âMy soul was bitterness to see you break And give the foe a passage from the lakeâ But this, oblivion hides, if now ye move Firm to the charge, and acts of valour prove. With quickening musick, to the field repair, And let your flag be rais'd to honour there.â Brown gave exampleâleading to the field, Where daring Backus the contention held. When broke the volunteers, Prevost combin'd Solid his powerâpress'd forward fill'd with mind: âThey'd vanish, said I not?âthe bayonet, charge! Gray, lead the van, and have the town at large. See, like loose chaff they fly!âthe same I said, When once our banner wav'd the onset dread! March to the village with a conquering tune, And these in front before the steel will swoon.â The shrill-ton'd drums strike chorus to his speechâ With ported bayonets they forsake the beachâ But lo, approaching in a martial mode, Where Lavalle, Aspinwall, defend the road, They hear the sound of death's appalling tongue, Sweeping whole files in crimson dust along: âThe eye quicken with fire!â (Thus Aspinwall,) âGlanceâglance the silver ere you fly the ball! They flash the airâbut pour you in the leadâ We check their progressâlo, we strike them dead! Another volley ere we give the groundâ Bleed from the heart, or through the brain-skull wound.â What time he spoke his warriors pour'd out death, And round their brows entwin'd the laurel wreath. The Albions faulter'd, in their movement dumbâ But soon excited by the maddening drum, Heavy with strength, they press'd the bold advance, Who slow gave backâyet wheeling at a glance, Oft slaughter'd on the heel. At length, they join The flinty Backusâplanted in a line, Ready to wrestle with the foe in arms, While a proud feeling in each bosom warms, To hurl defiance on th' invading throng, And Backus thus supports it with his tongue: âHow my heart flourishesânew-brac'd with nerve! Keep the springs bent till you the eye observe. We need no bulwarks to defend our right, Hence, open bosom'd will we meet the fight. Touch not to fire till opposite yon treeâ An oak, that shades the valleyâWarriors! see, Their battle whistles o'er our heads in vain! But lo, they come! With blood make fat the plain!â Scarce had the hero the commandment spoke, When all the field was circumvolv'd in smoke, Burning with fire! Whole files of Britons dieâ Evans faints backward with a death-roll'd eye, The flames augmenting round!âyet fearless Gray, Albion's first honour, urges on the fray; And Backus rising on Columbia's side, With glowing voice awakens all their pride: âHold, hold in gloryâhold the proud defence! Stand!âas with lightnings drive the royals hence. See how they reel and faint before the shot! Never your deeds in time will be forgot. See, what confusion in their ranks transpire! Ye war like heroes of my soul's desire! Charge triple loads, and level at the breast, That every ball may bleed a heart to rest!â His falchion as he ended, flash'd with lightâ His every gesture spirited the fight: So infant lions meet with tygers' young, While roaming for their prey the woods among,â Bristling their backs, they growl and forth engageâ The battle equal, furious burns their rage. The old one near instructs her whelps to fight, Advancing, bending, crouching, springing lightâ Her proud example and approving eye, Excite their energiesâthe tygers die: Backus not less with valiant gestures cheer The bosoms of the brave to smile at fear. Th' invaders vanish from the stream of death, Like snow-drifts scatter'd by the whirlwind's breath. But Gray in character a quenchless brand, Unites his column with the blade in hand: âWhat darkness cover us!âinglorious shame!â (His soul excited with a furnace flame.) âAnd will ye faulter, one oppos'd to ten! Onâon, ye English!âshow the deeds of men!â His voice combin'd them to renew the frayâ Desperate the strifeâdeath sucks the life away! To what created will the scene compare? Does nature fail, or is the subject bare? Or is the Muse exhausted by her toil?â Her strength receiv'd the weakness of a foil? She yields the mental strifeâregains her breathâ The field of battle is the field of death, Where Freedom stands a multitude of foesâ Where from the heart a crimson fountain flows. At length outnumber'd, slow the brave retire Inch after inchâat times clancing fireâ Back from the driving of the storm they hieâ But lo, they wheelâagain the foe defy. Thrice press the Albions charging in their ire, And thrice with shatter'd columns they retire: So by the spirit of the whirlwind driven, A wave is mounted to the cheek of heaven, Mad foaming to the shore,âthe solid shore Breaks back the billow by its moveless power. Again the mountain swells upon the sea To tear the basement of the rock awayâ The shore unalter'd shivers it again, And rolls it brokenâhowling o'er the main.â Yet still the spirit of the storm is nigh, To heave its foaming summit to the skyâ With sound of armies striving in their wrath, The wave comes roaring through its watery path; The strong-ribb'd battlement, to earth fast lock'd, Again dissolves it in its strength unshock'd: So Gray, the spirit of the Albion host, Thrice form'd his broken squadrons on the coastâ So Backus stood unshaken in his power, And roll'd them backward like the unmov'd shore. Yet Gray, unconquerable, his band unites, And once again their energy excites: âOnâroyals!âon!âwith steel of bayonet charge! Close wedg'd in column let the blood stream largeâ Another effort, and the day is oursâ The Stars already faint before our powers! âAnd when they darken to the English name, Let nothing soil the brightness of our fameâ Shunâfly pollution's touch. With soothing care, Tender bright honour to the captive fair. No deeper stain our valour can debase, Than touch in thought the snowy-bosom'd raceâ The lilies of the earthâ âWith bayonets, onâ And do such deeds as match the noon-day sun!â His heavy column thunder in their courseâ The hero leading on his mettled horse, Wielding his falchionâbending back his eyes, To heart his band to rush upon the prize. A drummer lad, who beat for Aspinwall, Saw Gray approaching, urgent to inthrall The patriots with despairâhe dropp'd his drumâ And, as strong breasted in his strength he come, He seiz'd a weaponâat his bosom rais'dâ Instant the rifle with explosion blaz'd! âEngland! pour on! the youth has pierc'd my life! My brave young warrior thou hast broke the strife. Take you my watch-pieceâtake itâa rewardâ In praise, farewell! Thou art thy country's guard!â He gasp'dâhe died. The ball had sadly tore His stomach through and graz'd the vital core: Thus when a lion is intent to seize A monster horseâamphibious of the seas, He chafes his bosom till he mads with ire, His eyeballs rolling as though lin'd with fire. Lo, as he comes like tempest in its wrath, An insect hornet meets him in his pathâ Swift as a sunbeam darts the anger'd fly, And strikes the centre of his mad-roll'd eye. The lion stops and bellows with the smart, Which fast augmenting, reaches to his heart. His balls distorted, show his life distress'dâ A sweating anguish oozes from his breast. His tongue trails in the sandâhe pants for breathâ He foams, he faintsâhe shivers into death: So Gray, while passion'd with a warrior's heat, Fell and expir'd beneath the stripling's feet. The Muse must pause, and o'er a foeman's bier Shed the sweet droppings of a parting tearâ Gray! thou shalt flourish. An exalted pride Distends my heart to tell how great you died! On thy green grave may flowerets ever new Breathe their sweet breath and weep celestial dew! Two stars of magnitude are Brock and Grayâ Never to fail while yonder orb gives day. Against the rotten crumbling of a throne, Like meteors bright on heaven's high hill they shone. The English heard the dying voice of Gray, And press'd where Fanning with his cannon layâ (His wounds yet bleeding from the plains of York.) The hero plants it fatal for the work. The match put forth, it speaks with thunder dread, Deafening the column struggling with the dead. Lo, Backus now upon his charger bounds, And thus the echo of his soul resounds: âStretch every nerve! The battle is at poise! This warring tumult is blest musick noise! Stand! prove your souls unconquerable, till Brown Assails the rear, and melts their vigour down. Behold, with volunteers he crowds the wood! Look, soak the earthâyeaâmake it drunk with blood! This hour will reach eternityââ His steed Dash'd like an arrow flying in its speedâ He fallsâhe gaspsâhe dies! A singing death Pierc'd his big heart, and roll'd him on the heath. Backus, the moment from his saddle sprungâ Back on the ground his clattering armour rung. Soon he perceiv'd the fatal lead had broke His brittle thigh: yet brightens he his look! Quick glanc'd his thoughts to future years afar, When the rough surface of the honour'd scar Would speak the valour of his youthful days, And he would hear the musick of his praise. Ah, never can it be! Pale fades thine eyeâ Thy heart is sinkingâfast thy pulses die! The drops of death are cold upon thy breastâ But O, eternal shall thy name be blest! Yet shalt thou live to see the Cross retireâ And then, like Pike, in Vict'ry's arms expire. Meantime Fredonia, seated high in heaven, Heard the fierce whirlwind by th' Infernal drivenâ Beheld the band from their defences fly, Though twice they'd caus'd the royal name to die. To test the secret wisdom of her Brown, She suffer'd Hell to elevate the crownâ But when she mark'd the Britons near their prize, Circled in dazzling rays she left the skies. Instant the Fiend beheld her coming forth, He dash'd the whirlwind backward to the north. Th' affrighted band that held the bulwark, stood, Sham'd that a panick had their hearts subdu'd. When Brown had plac'd the warriors of MacNitt With fighting Backus, where severe they lit Fire searching for the heartâhis post retook On rising ground, the field to overlook To watch the changes of the battling sceneâ Standing collected with unalter'd mien; Though something whisper'd to his soul despair, Yet nothing outward would his eye declare, For Gray appear'd determin'd in his will, To gain his purpose or his blood to spill. But when he saw the gathering of the band, That late had fled the passage of the land, A vital thought quick glanc'd upon his soul To formâand lead them where the waters roll, And, by a feint to make the foe believeâ A home retreat he never could achieve. The thought scarce pass'd him, when he wing'd his horseâ Reaching the crowd, he thus commenc'd discourse: âYou've done us worse than death! Degenerate race! What bent your souls to darken with disgrace The honour of our arms? Behold yon Star! There stand your brothers mid the flames of war, To guard your Freedom from polluting stain, While you like drones upon the field remain! Blush at the deed! Fill'd is my soul with ireâ The man that turns shall swift as flame expire! My passion will no more! Onâmarch with me, And soon the foe will dash into the sea. Mark, as you value life my voice attendâ He, who dare loiter, shall to dust descend!â His threatening language to their bosoms went, While from his eye an angry flame was sent, Which rent their souls as lightning rends a cloudâ His voice was thunder rolling deep and loud. They form, they stand, half courage, half through dread Of him, the warrior, their commanding head. He spread them large, and lead them through the wood, As though to block the passage of the flood, To strike the invading enemy with awe, That they in safety never could withdraw. This art was done while Fanning's cannon tore The Albions down and roll'd them in their gore; And strength of Backus with a burning eye, Dealt a full portion of mortality. When Prevost mark'd his legions sink in blood, And Brown advancing to Ontario's flood, As though to bar him from a life's retreatâ Sudden his heart was frozen of its heat:â His eye show'd wildness like a madman's stareâ A horror seiz'd, and fix'd his every hair! âLost!âlostâforever lost! The ruin shun! The forest teams with death!âcut offâundone! Leap to the barges! In a moment, seeâ We pour our blood and find eternity!â He fled while speaking. Panick strikes the wholeâ Their fears augmentingâdown is every soul. They leap their barges with despairing bound, Leaving their dead and wounded on the ground: As when a huge rough rock of crashing weight, By earthquake riven from Alleghany's height, Plunges down headlongâsmiting in its course The trees that had endur'd the whirlwind's forceâ Leaping from rock to rock,âup-whirling round, Rolling in fire convulsing o'er the ground: Swift dashing as the rock the Albions fled, Leaving their bleeding, dying, and their dead. CANTO XXIV. CAPTURE OF FORT GEORGE. ARGUMENT. The Flags of Truce .... Bombardment .... The concentration of the Army at Four-Mile Creek .... The Descent .... The surrender of Fort George. The sceneâSackett's Harbour, Little York, Forts George and Niagara, and in Heaven .... The time from the period of Prevost's retreating from Sackett's Harbour to the end of the canto is about thirty-six hours. While thus the enemy in panick fledâ Brown fill'd the upper element with leadâ His every eye he fix'd upon the air, Lest he, by wounds, should madden with despairâ Hence, he of slaughter made a mocking show To cloak his real weakness from the foe, His infantry displaying through the wood, To swell their fearful passions to the flood: Not otherwise grim tygers fierce beset The lion's den, till all with blood is wetâ The lion absent searching to supply His crying youngâtheir wants to satisfyâ Lo, he returns and finds his lioness Yielding her charge to the unequal press! He growls with anger, like the peals that break The midnight clouds and cause the hills to shake, Then wheelsâas though to hunt the tyger's lair, T' appal their hearts and damp them with despairâ The tygers hear his voiceâturnâview his pathâ Fear at the instant takes the place of wrath. They leave the lion's den to guard their ownâ Their bold invasion at a cast o'erthrownâ They pass the lion bristled in his rage, As though he dar'd their numbers to engage, But they in wildness leave him like the wind, Thoughtless to scan the secret of his mind: So like the lion, Brown display'd his power, As though intent to keep them to the shoreâ While in his breast he cherish'd no desire, Equal to see them to their fleet retire. The enemy withdrawnâthe warrior led Behind the mound the volunteers that fledâ Their looksâbut not their tongues to him declare, Should Albion press, they'd leave their life's blood there. With these, the hero in his wisdom joins The strength of Aspinwall's unshaken lines. With soothing accent, Lavalle he commands: âTender remove with sympathy's soft hands The bleeding foe, and those of Freedom's nameâ Our first regard the fainting warriors claim. Cool with the fountain stream their feverish glow, And every succour from the heart bestow. Entomb the honour'd dead,âthe holy rite, Let all receive who pour'd their blood in fight. âOn Queenstown's rocky steep, our Morris lay Mangled and naked to the beams of day, Where savage men and savage birds of air, Gorg'd on his flesh and scalp'd his auburn hair! But Freedom melts to mercy for the brave, Hence, with due honour shroud them in the grave. In future ages let our names descend, Tygers in battleâbut tho captive's friend.â When Brown had finish'dâLavalle forth convey'd The wounded to receive the surgeon's aid. The dead he buried in the silent tomb, Till life immortal on the earth shall bloom. Soon as the panick of the foe was pass'd, They learnt the means by which their strength was cast, Which caus'd a gloom to darken o'er the fleetâ Shame blank'd their pride for the disgrac'd retreat. To counteract the pain severe, they bite Their fever'd lips and knit their eyebrows tight. Prevost, repentant, stoops his troubled headâ At length he rous'd himself and angry said: âNewell, delay not with a flag to Brown, And bid him strike his starry banner down. What, by deception shall we own us beat? He strikesâor madly I'll the storm repeat!â Newell, with banner waving, skimm'd the floodâ Before the chieftain presently he stood: âLo, I from Prevost this commandment bring, That from yon height you bend the Eagle's wing. Pause notâthe village will be smote with fire, And every age and character expire! Comply, whilst now his favour you'll receiveâ Vouchsafe, I pray you, to resign and live!â Brown ey'd the herald with contemptuous look Pausingâat length he Spartan language spoke: âReturn to Prevost and to him make known, That I invite him to approach the town, And from yon summit wrench the Eagle down!â Newell receiv'd the answerâand from shore Loosen'd his yawl, and leap'd the waters o'er. âMost royal Prevost!âhis reply was shortâ These words he bade me to your ear report: ââReturn to Prevost and to him make known, That I invite him to approach the town, And from yon summit wrench the Eagle down!ââ As when a peacock with a lofty stride Distends his plumes like rainbow in its prideâ Rising in consequence at every turnâ Treating his neighbours with contemptuous spurn. His haughty step, the blood vindictive heats Of chanticleer, who battle meditatesâ Round as he makes a consequential whirrâ He leaps and strikes his bosom with his spurâ The flaunting bird shrinks cowering at the blow, And all the glitter of his plumes is low. So Prevost's mettle, at the voice of Brown Granting his will to wrench the Eagle down, Dropp'd from the glitter of his gold to leadâ A sudden dampness vertigo'd his head.â He strove to heave the load by passion's frownâ In vainâthe pressure pull'd his feelings down. Newell at length, receiv'd a new behestâ A dire foreboding rising in his breast: âWe'll let the Eagle for the time remain, Till we our wounded can relieve from pain. An apprehension creeps upon my blood, That Brown, avenging, hath their life subdu'd. A retribution may inflame his wrath To bathe their bodies in a gory bath. When Proctor rioted at Raisin's shore, And urg'd our allies in their thirst for gore, At Kingston I the murder blaz'd afar, For which I dread retaliating war. âWhy do we stand? perhaps they even now, Pleading for mercy, feel the dagger's blow!â Newell, attending to his fearful call, Leap'd with the banner in the tilting yawl. Brown soon his coming at a distance spied, And wheel'd to meet him at the water's side. He lands, and speaks the message: âThis I bear To plead for those who suffer in despair. As thou shalt mercy to our wounded give, So from our hands shalt thou in turn receive. Noânever were we known to shed thy bloodâ 'Twas savage rioters at Raisin's flood.â The name of Raisin enter'd to his heart, As through its centre were a driven dart: So in similitude the good Fayetteâ Never the deed Columbia will forget!â While with drawn falchion kindling through his line, To die or conquer at the Brandywine, Fell with deep wound, unsightly to the earth, And stream'd his blood like holy unction forth. In healing,âpush'd a fungus from the sore, Which damp'd all prospects of indulgent cureâ 'Twas grief to Washingtonâthe sage resign'd Craig, his choice surgeonâwho with skilful mind, Open'd the wound, which tortur'd him afresh, And from the bone remov'd th' unhealthy flesh: But young Fayette prepar'd for the event, Endur'd the rackâa moveless monument: Thus Raisin's slaughter, which had torn the heart, By softening time was gently heal'd in partâ But when the herald spake the scene to life, It cut the vitals like the surgeon's knifeâ Yet, like Fayette, unalter'd in his pain, Brown kept the anguish of his soul in chain. After short pausing in a close disguise, He to the Briton recklessly replies, Till the rank murder, festering at his heart, Compell'd the hero to reveal the smart: âWhat sudden circumstance hath bent his mind?â It seems as fickle as the veering wind. Methinks he treats my invitation light, To wrench yon arrowy Eagle from her height. âBut, irony aside: To yours I give The same attentions that my own receive. Your dead have I inhum'd with decent awe, Such as the soldier should desire in war. âAlas, how guilt will crowd the mind with fear! Before whose sight a thousand shapes appear Murky as deathâmaking the soul reveal Those very actions it should close conceal! âWhy did you touch my ear with Raisin's stream? It scorches on my heart like boiling flame! 'T was savage rioters that done the deed!â O vain excuse!âit never will succeed. Did not hell Proctor urge them on the way, And for the scalps advance the horrid pay? Did not this Prevost, with ungenerous soul, A fell salute on the occasion roll? What, smile at murder of the deepest dye! No wonder now that ye for mercy cryâ But where was mercy at that dreadful hour, When martyr'd heroes sunk beneath your power? âWhat was the language at Sandusky Fort? âDamn without mercy!ââwere the words of Short. When did you tomb young Morris from the light, That now reciprocal you ask the rite? Who treacherous burst their magazines with flame? Those, who at Raisin urg'd our death the same! Who deck with scalps their legislative hall? âGreat God!âI feel my mercy to recall! âOnce Albion's name in bright effulgence stoodâ 'Tis written now in characters of blood! Throw off the maskâbe hypocrites no moreâ Say to the world: âWe feed on human gore!â And not with low debasement thus descend To plead the life of brother, father, friend, When you of wife, of infant, friend, and sire, Make bare their skulls, and then apply the fire! âTyrants are dastards!âtrembling at their life, Fearing that Justice would make sharp his knife. âSpeak to this Prevost, that my soul in wrath Will every captive of existence scath,â Should he, this monster-man,âbut even dare To stain with gore a fillament of hairâ Yeaâshould my heart drop blood to give command, I pledge to heaven, that these my words shall stand! âBut should he act, as man should do to man, Most glad will I reciprocate the plan.â It's pleasant to my heart, mercy to show To the bent captive, or the wounded foe. âBut mark my purpose wellâbeware thy deedsâ A freeman suffers, swift a royal bleeds! Beware! the Eagle sharps her talons keen, To guard the blood of her surrender'd men! âHerald, return and bear my offer'd peace, If so he willsâand grace return for grace.â Brown ended mildâbut yet the Albion stood, As though his heart were emptied of its blood. At length, regain'd the motion of his breast, He hasten'd to convey the chief's behest. Waiting the messenger's return, Prevost Stood in his trembling like a palsied ghost. But Newell comes: âPut off this cast of fear, And let the aspect of thy brow be clear. Our maim'd the care of valiant men receiveâ Yeaâevery blessing in their power they give. Our dead are decent in their graves interr'd, According as to them were ranks conferr'd. âBut Brown in solemn oath appeal'd to heaven, Except reciprocal was mercy givenâ By all that lives,âin presence of his God, Swift he'd retaliate on Albion's blood! âHe spoke abhorrent of your grand salute For Raisin's fieldâyeaâsunk you to the bruteâ Mention'd the scalp of bloodâthe magazineâ Unburied Morrisâother deeds of sinâ But these dark scenes, though burning in his mind, Shall not have power to warp his nature kind. And if your bosom be inclin'd for peace, Glad he'll reciprocate sweet grace for grace.â He ended. But so dark was Prevost's soul, Not virtue's self his nature could control; Though Brown for evil had return'd him good, When he expected naught but blood for blood. Worse than a savage is that heart of stone, When good for evil does not melt it down. Th' ungrateful Briton rising from his dread, With air important to inferiors said: âWell did I know that Brown would never dare Than treat our warriors with attentive care. His oath I disregard. An Albion life He durst not frown upon when bent in strife. I'll blaze salutes, and if it please me well, Resign the captur'd to the savage steel. âYeo, weigh anchor and forsake the shore, And when off Kingston, let your cannon roar As though our flag had won. 'Twill never do, At our return, to state the matter true. What, publish a defeat? Britannia's shame! Neverâ'twould sully her imperial name! Yesâwe'll proclaim the conquest of the day By royal language, and a proud display Of various splendour on the coming even, Far to outshine the twinkling lights of heaven. âMy next essay shall be the state of Yorkâ The fall of Plattsburg will begin the work.â Though boasting was his tongue, he inward felt What baseness feels when overcharg'd with guilt. He seem'd to disregard the voice of Brown, Yet shrunk his soul to wake his sleeping frown. Like him a boaster with importance swells, As though in valour he the world excelsâ But lo, a stripling with courageous mind, With one keen glance reduces him to wind: Yeo immediate from the bay unmoor'd, Which fill'd with joy his mariners on board. His keels cut smooth the bosom of the seaâ And with salute and counterfeited glee He enter'd Kingston as the sun stood weigh'd, Balanc'd in heaven, and in the deep display'd His image, soften'd to admit the eye To gaze upon him in his brilliancy. While this was passing, Brown prepar'd to sailâ For now inviting blew the eastern gale. He gave to Tuttle's hand the town's defence, Should Proctor madly dare to drive him hence: Tuttle with zeal had measur'd through the day, Full fourteen leagues to join the rumour'd frayâ Vain was his energyâtoo late he came To play his cohorts 'gainst the Albion name. Brown in the Pert ship o'er the sea-lake fliesâ The evening sunbeams fading in the skies. The stars direct him in his course at nightâ York distantly appears in view at light. The Pert declares his coming by saluteâ He anchorsâChauncey joins him with his suitâ To whom he shows how royalty was beat, And how he fled disorder'd to their fleet. On joyful wind the welcome tidings flyâ Shouts swelling from the heart ascend the sky;â While crowding to the beach the warriors tread, The guns through ether the achievement spread. To Chauncey, Brown immediately begun: âThe troops embarkârapid the minutes run. Now be it ours, offensive war to wageâ The former object must our souls engage, To strike the Lion at the Fort of Georgeâ Below Niagara land us for the charge.â He ceas'd. And Chauncey echo'd the command, For barges swift to dart upon the land, And bear from thence the patriots to the fleet, In conquering arms the enemy to meet. The bargemen hasten to the shore and bring, Proud to the ships, Boyd, Ripley, Forsythe, King. Soon is the navy with the warriors stow'dâ Chauncey weighs anchorânavigates the flood. The amorous zephyrs kiss the canvass lightâ Their honied breaths propel him with delight. As soft the clouds absorb the evening beams, And sweetly place them in the azure streamsâ The azure streams reflecting them again, Picture the heavens upon a silver plain, Below Niagara the navy moors, And forth the army lands upon the shores. While these events were passing, Rensselaer Resign'd to Lewisânext in character.â His aged blood, exhausted by defeat, Requir'd the balsam of a home retreat: Thus a proud courser of majestick size, With living nerve, defiance in his eyes, Bounds in the race with animated spring, And soon outstrips the racers of the ring. With shouting voice the multitude proclaim His fleetness worthy of the palm of fame:â But lo, while racing in his aged day, By unfair curbing through the burning way, A bold competitor receives the prizeâ His big heart failsâgrief dims his watery eyes. Touch'd with despair, he leaves the coursing plains, While eating sorrow shrivels up his veins: So Rensselaer, by treachery subdu'd, Forsook the war-plains in desponding mood, And all to Lewis of his grade resign'dâ Whose bosom held a jewel of a mind. Now when Brown's nephew in the Lady came, And spoke to Lewis of the deed of fameâ Conquest of York,âand notic'd then, the charge Soon to be made against the rock of George, Lewis to Hobart thusâHobart, a youth, Rever'd for all that's valuable of truth: âYoung warrior, haste to where the barge are laid Above the fortress,â'neath the poplar shade. Take skilful shipwrights with your band beside, Them to repair, and launch them in the tide. âAnd when you cast them in the stream above, Them to the harbour of the ships remove:â Swift from these waters will the troops proceed, When Brown shall land from York,âto do the deed. âNow, should the battery from the Albion side, Oppose your effortsâlaunching in the tide, You'll plant your cannonâits combustion burn, And shot for shot against the foe return.â Lewis commanded. Straight with zealous heart, A chosen number marches with Hobart. Soon they arrive at where the boats were laid, Fenc'd from the sun beneath the forest shade. The hardy shipwrights enter on their toil, To crowd the chinks through which the waves would boil. On the same morn of th' eventful day, That Chauncey anchor'd in the inlet bay, Hobart had made them of their breakings staunch, And in the waters them began to launch, When lo, the battery at the adverse land, Open'd to cast them broken on the strand. Hobart drives back the effort with his gunâ Swift through the lines th' alarming thunders run. At once, the element is roll'd in fire, And each quick instant magnifies it higher: Thus from the rock-laid battlements of death Complexing trains are artful plac'd beneathâ Yet, though diverg'd in labyrinthine maze, The whole a sparkle kindles to a blaze.â After fair notice, still the reckless foe Dares to advance unmindful of the blowâ The signal waves! The forted touch the fire, And backward, leaping from the scene retire. The smouldering match, exhausted of its length, Excites the train with vitalizing strengthâ At first, the weakest magazine explodesâ Presently th' element another loads With flames Vesuvian. Another train Conveys the darting fire and lights the grain Within a deeper, larger house of hell, Which thunders off tremendous, with a peal Deafening the heavens. At once another rollsâ In lightning glimpse another splits the poles: Like this, from fort to fort the 'larums runâ Gun, with deaf noise exploding, answers gun. George at the signal, lightens up its wallsâ Niagara opposite, lets loose the balls. T' adjoining bulwarks magnify the sound, Which swells like earthquakes breaking from the ground. From either height roll cataracts of flame, Equal to nature in its wildest frame: So when deep mines contains th' inflaming gas, Which, by fermenting, quickens to a blaze, A dread explosion to high heaven is cast, Destruction flying on the reddening blastâ Thick clouds sulphureous, mountain-heights involveâ The stars shrink backâthe elements dissolveâ Earth groans with labouring pangs. Fresh from the tomb The dead start forth, though Judgment Day had come. Something like this appears the conflict direâ Contending thunders mix'd with heaven's red fire. While thus the globes at each, like frenzy smite, The deep-mouth'd cannon rock'd the steadfast height, To Lewis, lo, a female warrior came, Whose eye show'd valour of the purest flame. He gaz'd her with surprise:ââPut off your fear, That I in this wild tumult should appear. My purpose is resolv'dâMy name is Doyleâ On Queenstown Height my husband stood the broil With rocky breast against th' o'erwhelming foeâ At every glance he laid the haughty low, With Scottâexpecting Strong's batalions o'er To give him strength to paralyze their power. âBut when his treason on the Heights was knownâ Compass'd with enemiesâdarkâfaintâaloneâ Reluctant he resign'd with bleeding soul, Expecting a release on his paroleâ This they refus'dâthe tyrantsâhearts of gall! And him with scoffing march'd to Montreal! âThis act hath stirr'd me to avenge his cause, And seek redress for violated laws. I crave the honour to assist the fight With yonder engine planted on the right. If not to wield its power, to heat the ball, That Newark, opposite, in flames may fall. âStrive not to urge me from the scene to flyâ If heaven so wills, contentedly I die. My husband fought them to defend his wifeâ To fill his absence, I'll maintain the strife.â âMost wonderous woman!â Lewis feeling thus: âIndeed thy daring seems too perilous. A marvellous sight to see a female stand, Where the balls fly like particles of sand. Would it be vain to urge you to withdraw In safety from this violence of war? Yes. I observe a something in your eye, That you would feel it an indignity. âTake thy desireâit never shall be said, That I debarr'd thee from the wonderous deed. May heaven protect thy valour in the frayâ Thy name will brighten till the earth's decay!â With feet scarce touching of the path she wheels, While conscious virtue in her breast she feels. Her proud achievements all the brave admireâ Her look, her voiceâtheir every heart inspire To reach for fame. Fredonia the divine, Unseen defends the matchless heroine, Lewis beholds her with excited soul, And these emotions from his bosom roll: âColumbia! safe art thou! No longer dread The touch polluting of a tyrant's treadâ Behold thy daughters, when that foes invade, Will meet them at the beach in arms array'd! Yeaâwill they brace their tender limbs in steel, And, in th' opposer's heart their spears conceal. Their eyes of beauty will the brave inspire To look with smiling at a chain of fire. Let foes approach, innumerous as the sand That lines the ocean,âto devour the land, Freedom! thy daughters will the tyrants foilâ They'll shout the onset: Liberty and Doyle!â While from his heart these sentiments he spoke, Loud clamorous war the rocky ramparts shook. The globes flew burning on the wings of flame, Which Newark kindled, and the fort the same, The blaze quick-flashing glanc'd aloft to heaven, While brands, mad-whirling through the void were driven. With such precision the Columbians aim, They cut the flag-lines and the standard maim. The Lion drops, superb with splendour crown'd, At which the patriots shout triumphant sound. Lewis exclaims: âOne heart pervades the whole! To mark your deeds conveys to heaven my soul! Your fiery circles singe the welkin roundâ Your roar of battle shames the earthquake sound! Cast, cast in volumes desolations forthâ Prove to the foe that Liberty has worth. To sum your virtues weakness is my voiceâ Sunder the rocks!âstrike heaven with stronger noise!â Fill'd with the rising of his fame, he spokeâ The welkin darken'd with the clouding smoke. At once a thousand engines felt the flame, And thunder'd,âsounding through creation's frame. The mad-drove bolts against the ramparts smite, As though Niagara's rock they'd disunite. Augmenting strife from brazen mouths expires, Till day's bright orb behind the hills retires. By parts scarce notable the ragings ceaseâ The star of evening brings the hour of peace. During the turbulence which shook high heaven, Hobart, conceal'd beneath the smoke, was driven Down to the inlet, unappall'd by dread Of solid thunders bursting o'er his head. Lo, at this juncture Riddle gain'd the fortâ Lewis saluted, and made brief report. Brown had despatch'd him when he struck the shore, As her last gun Niagara ceas'd to roar. âChauncey has anchor'dâand from Brown I'm sent To bear to you his present sentiment. You'll rank your columns into marching form, And meet him on the beach the foe to storm.â Thus he. And Lewis thus: âMake known to Brown, My soul is with him. I'm directly down. Speak to his heart that I rejoice to hear His fame is rising in its character.â This, from deep feeling he impressive saidâ Riddle quick leaping with the message sped. Lewis collects his warriors in a square, To whom his voice is sweet as musick rare: âSoldiers! this day you've done immortal deed, Which names unborn in history will read. Still scenes more bright in hopeful prospect lieâ At orient dawn we face them eye to eye. We pass the waters from the beach below, Where Brown and Ripley wait our coming now. With them we wed our soulsâjoin heart and hand To plant the Eagle on the hostile land,â Yeaâere the bird of night concludes her note, With plated bosoms on the wave we float. âBrave men! I scan your hope: you long once more T' unfurl the Star-gemm'd banner on the shore. No cowards, traitors, wait our coming forth, But those we join through fire have prov'd their worth. Their souls are gold thrice crucibled with flameâ Their hearts cemented to their country's fameâ These, these are they: King, Forsythe, Ripley, Brown,â Around whose brows the halo of renown Blazes effulgentâuseless to express What rank is their'sâtheir names their country bless. âBut thou, MacFreely, gifted with a mind To bend to circumstanceâwill stay behind,â All cannot hope to move upon them thereâ Some must remain to guard with jealous care This rock-ribb'd battlement. Oft it requires To check the impulse of our soul's desires. Frequent to him a greater fame descends, Who curbs his passions as his duty bends, Than to the warrior, who in day of fight, Has ample freedom to put forth his might. âYour looks show cheerfulness.â âShrill musick, strikeâ To join the band immortaliz'd by Pike!â Loud beats the martial movement. Lewis leadsâ Next Scott, to shine magnificent in deeds; Then Porter, with a soul to honour given, A radiant gemâthe workmanship of heaven. The meantime Chauncey every thought employ'd, How, by his fleet, their mounds could be destroy'd. When plac'd had he the buoys to mark the ground, He gave these orders to inferiors round: âChiefs of the navy!âsoon as streaks of day Shall line the east and in the waters play, Brown with his army will assail yon height, And bathe the Stars in heaven's ethereal light. âBut ere for him 'tis possible to land, We must make desolate these works at hand. âTaunt, in the Julia, Mix, in Growler, on, And strike the battery plac'd at Newark town. Stephens, position in Ontario take, North of the tower that lightens up the lake; Keep to the shore, and every part filade, And thus the Julia and the Growler aid. Brown, in the Tompkins with selected crew, At Two-Mile Stream will give the foe his due; Grapple your anchors to the British side, Ere your red flashes quicken o'er the tide. And Brown of younger years, from Conquest roll The bombs with judgment till you smite the soul, Crossing your brother's fire. And near at hand, In Hamilton, MacPherson, sweep the land, Smith in the Asp, and Osgood in the Scourge, Will anchor bow to stern. At signal urge Your mariners to fame, and blazing scour The hostile beach to aid the landing power. The buoys I've fix'd for every ship to cast, That each the instant may begin the blast. âWhen Venus shall appear in yonder skies, Then let the violence of battle rise.â Each took his partâretir'd a several way, And watch'd impatient for the star of day. The same time Chauncey with his ships of mightâ Oneida, Madison, and Lady, light, Made to the shore, his barges either side, To bear the warriors o'er the parting tide. Lewis, advancing with his veteran host, Soon joins with Brown upon the rocky coast. With friendship's hand they each the other greet, Like absent brothers when they joyful meet. The troops with keen-edg'd appetite prepare Their blood to nourish with a soldier's fare. The juicy ox upon the coals they throw, Which cause the gravies in abundant flow Rich to stream forth, from whence quick flashes riseâ The quivering flesh sharp hissing as it fries. The banquet o'er,ârefresh'dâwith voices strong, They hymn to Washington in choral song: âAll hail the Sage!âthe sainted, sacred name To live coeval with the starry frameâ Immortal Washington! to thee we singâ Thou, who defy'd the wrath of Briton's King. Approving Heaven beheld thy battle justâ Smote by thine arm, thrones crumbled to the dust! The blaze of Freedom round thy standard roseâ Thy flashing sword was blindness to thy foes. Faction disarm'd fled wither'd at thy frownâ Thou snatch'd the diamond from the Albion Crown. The Lion crouch'd beneath thy lightening eyeâ The Eagle rose on wings of Liberty!â Plac'd here sublime on Independence's Height, Then Heaven receiv'd thee in a flood of light! âSustain thy children nowâgive wisdom strongâ Descend, Immortal! lead thy sons alongâ To Fame's proud summit, lead, O, lead the way! Bend down thy greatness from ethereal day! âPraises to thee by every tongue are given, Who breathe the element of earth or heaven!â Great Washington, sublime in glory, sat On flowers celestial,âdeep in musing thought, Not like the grovelling of weak man confin'd, But free, immense, unbounded as the mind. Franklin was near attending to the song, Which charm'dâthough echo'd from a mortal tongue. Green waving with the honey'd breeze above, Orange, and spices, form a breathing groveâ A red breast warbles in the brambles sweetâ A nectar stream runs murmuring at their feet. The lake expands its bosom to the right, Curling its silver waters in their sight. Blithe round the borders of the lake are seen The kid and lambkin bounding o'er the green. Remote, the lawns are interspers'd with hills, Down which the streamlets glide from golden rills. The mountains rise beyond, and gorgeous climb With towering majesty the dome sublime. Franklin to Washington: âHearken! from earth, What anthems sound expressive of thy worth! Descend and visit them. Listen! the noteâ How sweet on silver air thy praises float! Descend, illustrious Shade!âthine ear incline, And to their anthem move thy tongue divine. Our children hail thee with enraptur'd breath, Around their brows to twine the laurel wreath.â He ended with beneficence. The chief, With spirit utterance answer'd him in brief: âI listen to the sound, and joyful fly To point their souls to immortality: But well thou know'st these praises truth exceedâ Far from perfection is our brightest deed When wrapp'd in mortal robesâ âThey call me hence To show the path that leads to their defence. My brother, rise not from this odorous bower, Till I return from the delightful tour.â These words were pass'd in less than half the time That earth could speak. On heavenly wings sublime, He cleaves the element! As when on fire, The passion'd mind leaps forward with desire From earth to heavenâfrom heaven, through space afar, The speed outglancing of each burning starâ Flies in a moment through creation's frame, Back the same moment on the wings of flameâ Yea, in the fleet expression of an eye Measures immeasurable immensity: Not with less speed his way he leap'd from heavenâ Hark! his voice echoes mid the stars of even: âFactious divisions will your Freedom castâ Heaven weeps in sadness for your discords pastâ Your watchwordâUnityâyour fame shall last, Be chain'd in one, as gold-bright stars that live, And each from each an holy light receive!â He pass'd to heaven. Fredonia, with her spear, That puts to shame the jewels of the sphere. Inscribes in capitals, mid stars that dance To seraph musick on the blue expanse: COLUMBIA SHALL PREVAIL! as light, they shine, Bearing the signet of the hand divine! A wonder chains the soul. Each up-turn'd eye Is lost in rapture gazing at the skyâ At length, o'erpower'd by passing scenes in heaven, To sleep relaxing are their bosoms given. Thus Milton, musing on his couch at night Of happy Eden, blooming in delightâ At length falls slumbering in his blissful train Of rich ideas that 'habit in his brainâ Lo, the sweet musick of a serenade, Touches his ear, and makes the vision fade. A sacred thrill to every sense is givenâ He thinks the musick is the voice of heaven. The dancing shadows of the full-orb'd moon, Climbing majestick to her midnight noon, Seem the divine inhabitants above, Rob'd in the soft habiliments of love. The concert failsâthe fibres of the soul, Outstretch'd beyond the effort of control, Relaxâand slumbers silent-footed creep, And wrap his senses in the down of sleep: Columbians thus with scenes of heaven oppress'd, Sunk down exhausted in the arms of rest. Now, as the star, that leads the dance of day, Peeps o'er the mountains east with coral rayâ And the sweet nightingale concludes her note, The fleet of vessels from their moorings floatâ As Chauncey bade, the ships their stations take, And the still morning with explosions breakâ The royal bulwarks answer from the shore, And each at each conflicting vollies pour. Now at the time, the fleet for action woke, But ere their thunders on the welkin broke, The early musick rattled from the drumsâ Shrill to the 'larum of the ear it comesâ The troops attended to the martial sound, And rose and stood in phalanx on the ground. The wonderous night they cherish'd as a dreamâ And each to other told the marvellous theme. Brown in the centre on his charger rode, And thus the purpose of his bosom flow'd: âYe sons of valiant sires! behold, once more We wave our standards on the royal shore. We bend no look upon our path behind, Till Albion's flag shall cease to ride the wind: âScott, to thy guidance the advance I giveâ Forsythe, support him and forever live. Boyd, for thy fame, I render you command Of Pike's, made widow'd by the treacherous band. Reserv'd in rear of Scott, conduct them forthâ Their souls' bright mettle is unsullid worth. MacClure, you'll flank their wings upon the shore With those of Albany and Baltimore. âWhen Chauncey's navy shall disturb the night, We crowd the beach with nimble footstep light. Oneida, Madison, and Lady, fair, Will to yon point t' embark the troops, repairâ Others in barges will the oar apply T' assault the foe with streamers waving high. Lewis, and Ripley, and myselfâon board The Madison will sailâour aid afford To strengthen Boyd's reserveâ âHearken! the sound Of battering war reverberates around! The ships of Chauncey 'gainst their bulwark now, Drive forth to break and rout the cover'd foe. âNo more. By tens the tilting vessels crowdâ Hard case your bosoms for the onset proud. Perry hath conquer'd on the lake above!â An equal valour let the land strength prove!â As swarming bees in merry month of May, Hang round the hive on emigrating day, Waiting the signal of the queen to move, To seek a lodge in some sweet sugar grove;â Behold, she rises on her quivering wingsâ The keen-vex'd air with clamorous buzzing rings, Her thousands darken on her course behind, And float redundant on the hollow wind: Thus the battalions to the navy hie, As twilight mantles in the orient sky. Now when the enemy, who held the fort, Heard the new thunderings of the ships' report, Vincent, the general, from his slumbers broke, And thus abruptly to his cohorts spoke: (He'd left the battlements of Queenstown rock, To fill in part the vacancy of Brock.) âWhence this alarm? And never will they tire, And cease to blaze the fulminating fire? Is it reality, they dare intend With desperate arm our forted powers to bend? I'd thought the late past day at dusky even, We'd sent sufficient of their souls to heavenâ But noânot satisfiedâere dawn of light, They come audacious, and provoke the fight! And let them come!âWe'll show them Queenstown blaze! Their sightless vision fix'd at heaven shall gaze! âMyers, lead forth like meteor from a cloud, And in the ravine your battalions crowd. Behind the rocks them artfully dispose, That not a file upon the shore may close. Keep in your silence till you strike them down, Nor fear the terror of the arm of Brown. That pass alone can they the shores assailâ This their last lifeâTheir efforts countervail. âI keep you waitingâvain for me to teachâ Let none unroyal violate the beach.â The Britons heard, and leap'd with flying speed To do as veteransâgain their sovereign's meed. Myers, worthy of honourâ(The Muse with pride, Delights to publish though on Albion's side,) Imparts his courage, passing through the shade Of waning night, that none should feel dismay'd. Cautious he leads them down the craggy steep, O'er whose brown rocks the infant fountains weep; On the rude cliffs the wint'ry cedars live, And life exuberant from the tears receive. At times, young eagles, in their nests on high, Scream to the winds that whistle mournfully. Down this ravine the English ranks descend, The rocky pass with valour to defend. They crouch secure behind the jutting rocks, T' avoid the violentâconcussive shocks Bursting from Chauncey's fleet, which flaming dash. And the rude battlements in atoms crashâ But Myers, deliberate, visits every part, And shows his warriors how to touch the heart. Now Scott approaching with a conqueror's mien Is by the royals from their ambush seen, And Myers bespeaks his band: âThey strike the shade, Which by the cedars in the deep is made, Ere that ye wake the slumber of the lead, Then scorch their being through the heart or head. âInvincibles! remember Queenstown Heightâ How pale they shrunk and yielded up the fight! I now conjure you to resist the shock, And stand, and consecrate the death of Brock! Of British chiefs, he stood the rarest flowerâ He fell lamented, e'en by Freedom's power. A generous enemy will weep the brave, Though in the strife he'd open'd them the grave. A coward ever will the world detestâ Yea, hold him hateful as a loathsome beastâ Hence, ever stand invincible, or die, To sleep with honour where the valiant lie. âBehold, their barges touch the quivering shade! Aim where the centre of their life is laid!â Ere the full echo of his voice was done, A flinty sparkle quicken'd every gun. The sound reverberating filled the glen, And the deep caverns roll'd it back again. Mad sung the lead at the Columbian powers, But still they press'd impetuous to the shores. âOffspring of Liberty! make bare the breast!â Thus Scott the rising of his soul express'd,â âThe smile of heaven pours light upon our pathâ Roll on like thunder when it rolls in wrath. What passing wonders on preceding even, Burst into view, and sham'd the stars of heaven! The courts celestial notice us aboveâ Yeaâin the promise of high heaven we move! The fight, the fame, the victory is oursâ An unseen Deity befriends our powers!â Rich from his soul each jewel word was said, Which made the eye start forward from the head. The oarsmen felt it as they bent the blade, And wing'd the barges to the rocky glade, Whence Albion stream'd the fire: Around each prow High toss the waves,âfoaming like wreaths of snow; Mad chafing to the stern they ebbing curl, And round the half-seen keels tumultuous whirl. While thus the barges dash'd with rapidness, Of Scott, a bullet rent his bosom's dress. Glancing his heart's best rib!âthe singing death Flew burning on to search for vital breathâ Touching the hero, stood the fair Hobart, It drank his blood!âit graz'd along his heart, Fracturing his bosom's boneâin fatal line, Cruel it drove and flatten'd on the spineâ Small on his breast the stain of crimson showsâ But large, and frothing from his mouth it flowsâ He points to heaven, and bids his band be trueâ And soon death bathes him in his icy dew: So when with hasty stroke a hardy swain Sweeps with the scythe the verdure of the plain, A tender lily falls and seems to die, By quivering as it fadesâwith agony. Scarce was the youth laid cold upon his bier, When the advancement to the rocks drew near. Scott, in his zealâth' abundance of his soul, Reckless of flames, which, sheeted, round him roll, Leaps from the dashing pinnaceâwades for shore, While thousands aim to steep his breast in gore! His imitating warriors flam'd with pride, Spring from the bargesâplunge into the tideâ Each eager, striving others to excel, Which stirs the waters to a whitening swell. But Hindman rushing,âof artillery band,â Is first whose foot is honour'd with the landâ Others pour round him, battling as they form, Their looks outscowling the descending storm: Thus, like the gathering from Ontario's deep, A cloud collects o'er Catskill's rocky steepâ At first, it grumbles with a feeble note, While fire-charg'd folds around its borders float, Scowling, and deepening, murky in their path, And, as they mingle, magnify their wrath. At length, the clouds thick congregate in one, Whilst thunders thundering increasing groanâ Rolling the summit of the mount in fire, Like Nature suffering on her funeral pyre: Like this the warriors gather in their might, While each augmenting swells the growing fightâ Scott pours his mandate forth: âOnâconquering men! Onâcharge impetuous through the rocky glen! With pointed steel rush solid on the foeâ Let wasting death be seen in every blow!â As when the winds collected under heaven,â From either pole to the equator driven, Meet in contention at the Amazonâ A sudden darkness fastens on the sun; From whirling eddies waterspouts arise, Which lift the ocean to the blackening skies; The winds conflicting summon all their force, And thunder up the stream to waste its course. Destruction sweeps behind with deafening roar, While the red tempests dash on either shore The mighty floodâthe bedded rocks are dryâ The loosen'd whirlwinds o'er the Andes flyâ And herds, and flocks, and man,âwithout a moan, Dieâforest crashâearth heaves a suffering groan: Not this unlikeâas, strong as forcing fire, Scott thunders up the ravine!âfoes expire, Or fly like chaff in whirlwinds! Myers weds the field, Glu'd in his blood, while hundreds fainting yield. King, the firm patriot, bleeds upon the ground, His thigh expos'dâblood gushing from the wound. But yet untam'd, he wields his dripping sword, Cheering his band by action and by word. Forsythe pursues the routed through the wood, And few in safety reach'd its solitude. Meantime to disembark his warriors, Boyd The every effort of his soul employ'd, For such the lake was in commotion toss'd, Too weak the winds to bear him on the coast. At length, by th' impatient spirit of his band, The vessels brave the stormâthey reach the land. Instant they form in column on the shore: âOn to the Fort, and down the royal power!â Boyd spokeâand is obey'd. Solid they tread The dusty path with bayonets glimmering dread. Scott joins his veterans to the General's band, And takes his place as second in command. The meantime Vincent, from the fort beheld The various movements which the day reveal'dâ Saw Scott invade the shore, reckless of all The bold exertions, pouring fire and ball, Of valiant Myers. But when his legions fled, To Manners, next in character, he said, With frenzy in his eye: âThe shore is lost! VeteransâInvinciblesâthe Albion boast! They bear upon the fort! Touch the slow fire! And while it burns let all that breathes retire!â Hurried he fled. Manners the match-fire plies, And, like an arrow, from the danger flies. In crowds, the Britons wedge the narrow gate, T' escape the soon explosion of their fate: Thus were those patriots, who, by dastard power Of Hull were yielded in a treacherous hour, Convey'd, heart-anguish'd o'er the distant sea, Fetter'd with chains of iron crueltyâ From thence, conducted to the walls of death, Dripping cold dew on Dartmoor's wizard heath. Once in the circuit of the sun of heaven, To them the breathing of the air is givenâ But lo, the keeper of the dungeon, Shortâ (Brother to him who bled at Croghan's fort,) To glut his vengeance for his brother's fall, Display'd his hellish band to flame the ball, And strike them to the earth: The order givenâ Swift through their breasts the burning leads were drivenâ Back shrunk the patriots to a wedge close bound, While numbers falling, gasp'd upon the ground; The smothering press augmenting at the door, Made their feet slippery with their brothers' gore! A frenzied horror glaring from their eye, Betray'd the soul in speechless agony! Like them, the Britons crowd to shun the fort, And fly the ruin ready to reportâ They flyâbut not in safety is their flightâ Numbers surrender to the victors' might. Manners, to Riddle yields upon the road, To whom he kindness of his nature show'd. Newark, the fort, the country far and wide, Submit to terms.âReduc'd is Albion's pride. Lo, Hindman, Stockton, foremost in the strife, Rush inâand at the peril of their lifeâ With soul-devotedness,âquick-handed snatch, Scorching the magazine, the fatal match! A fraction of a moment, and the spark Had rent the fort and dropp'd them in the dark! Now Scott and Boyd the parapet arise, And down the standard hateful to their eyes; Exulting mounts upon triumphant wings The Bird of Jove!âwhilst loud the welkin rings With shouts of victory from tongue to tongueâ Redoubling thunders the proud theme prolong! In joys sublime the victors spend the evenâ But when the early stars are high in heaven, Of grateful slumber they partake the feast, Till morn shall blush with beauty in the east. CANTO XXV. COURT OF ST. JAMES'S, &amp;c. ARGUMENT. The Royal Convocation .... Brown takes possession of Fort Erie .... Drummond arrives at Little York .... Sheffie joins the Army .... Riall encamps upon the Chippewa. SceneâEngland, Fort George, Little York, Chippewa, and Fort Erie .... The time is thirty-five days. In the same hour of victory, that George Its flag surrender'd to the patriot charge, Shelby enchain'd the Lion in his might, And plac'd the Eagle on her native height. And now the Fiend t' advance his hellish schemes, Having conducted Proctor from the Thames, Leaps at a bound th' Atlantick ocean o'er, To seek fresh armies to invade the shore;â But ere he ventures to the Palace hall, He casts his form in manner magical: His wings he sloughs away, as snakes their skin, Smoothing with art his thunder scars of sin. A heavy blade he girds about his waist, While badges of command his shoulders grac'd. His age he represents in manhood's bloomâ Proud o'er his helmet nods a crimson plume,â Like those at fashion's toilet, he anoints With aromaticks his elastick joints, By which in part, he overcomes the scent Of sulphur fumesâhis native element.â Assumes the very size, the look, the speech, Of treacherous Elliot, ere he quits the beach. Now as the sun's last farewell leaves the sky, Stately he moves t' effect his embassy. Soon he arrives before the palace gates, And thus deceptive to the ward relates: âBehold, I come a herald to the king, Late from the west, intelligence to bring. My name is Elliot,ânor perhaps am I Known as a stranger to his majesty.â Forth to the king, the warder makes report, Thron'd in the centre of his peers at courtâ Gibbs, Packenham, and Riall, Lambert, Keenâ Beckwith, and Cockburn, with a serpent's mienâ The Drummonds, Cochrane, smile upon the rightâ Ross, Brooks, and Parker Sir Peter Parker.âa Britannick knightâ Thornton, the gallant warriorâGobbins, Lane,â Late from the field of Waterloo and Spainâ And other chieftains of inferior name;â Their decorations render back the flame Of golden lamps which from the dome depend, And round the hall a starry brilliance send, Exposing all their princely toys to viewâ The stars, the garters, and the ribands blue. The ready porter, by the king's command, Returnsâand with a fashionable hand Conducts the counterfeited Fiend to court, Where little men chace butterflies for sport. Scarce he the palace enter'd, when he fell With flexile knee to aid his purpose well. He look'd disorder'd with his soul struck dumb, As though the tinsel had his nerves o'ercome. He strove to greet the monarchâbut his tongue Denied its office to the courtly throng. Him soon the king reliev'd: âOur subject, rise! This modest blush is mark of wisdom wise. This deep embarrassment of thine give o'er, And let thy knee no longer kiss the floor. From western wilds, your feelings must be strange, When sudden introduc'd to splendid change: Yes, for a time, the thoughts will scatter hence, On first beholding such magnificence. âT' exalt thy name, shall honours be conferr'dâ With Our own hand We gird thee with a sword. The Knight of Raisin, We create thee nowâ Your deeds have wove this garland for your brow. âOur ear impatient for the tidings waits, For lo, We've heard Our cause debilitates.â The monarch thus. And thus th' Invisible: âDread Sire! thy bounties other kings excel! Could but my tongue find language for my heartâ But not the power of nature, or of art, Could with the feelings of my breast accord To render thanks for honours you've conferr'd! âMost true, I've aided Proctor in the strife, And urg'd the savages in waste of lifeâ Yeaâhave I smil'd to see them choke in gore Those ancient traitors to thy royal power! âThough I, unhappy, in the States was bredâ I soon by instinct from their borders fledâ Fled from confusion, where the low are free, To kneel adoring to thy Sovereignty! âBut O, now deign to bend thy gracious ear, And thou thy triumphs from the west shalt hear: âAt the next solstice, when at Raisin's shore, We gain'd the field and sprinkled it with gore, Shelby, with thousands of Kentuckians strong, Pass'd Erie's oceanâfollow'd us along, Full to the Thamesâbut there, severe we stoodâ Breasted the fight, and melted them in blood. Proctor contended like a lion boldâ The deaths his falchion gave, were manifold. Rout, rout ensu'dâwings, centreâall entireâ Swift we pursu'd them like a cloud of fire. âThough rent in piecemeal were their ranks, complete, And the Republick found a dead defeat, Yet won it was, most grievous to our lossâ Tecumseh fell defending England's Cross! Kentucky's monster, Johnson, in the strife, Bereft the warrior of his potent life. Thy crown has gain'd a diamond by the fightâ Full equal that, when Proctor put to flight Croghan, a wasp, that held Sandusky Fort, Of which thy messengers have made report. âWhile these events at Erie's lake transpir'd, Which rais'd thy standard to its height desir'd, Around Ontario, the gloomy Brown Display'd his strength to pull your glory down.â The different towns at which he made his charge, Were Queenstown, Kingston, Little York, and Georgeâ But at the former village and the last, Vincent subdu'd his standards at a blast. Sheffie, at York exploding magazine, Smote them with death, appalling to be seen. Pike fellâwhose name the stoutest heart appall'dâ A storm in fight, like heaven with fire inthrall'd. âBut far the proudest deed remains untold, Achiev'd by Prevostânever yet controll'dâ Distrust me not, that I the truth make largeâ Twelve ships of battle yielded to his barge! Yet paus'd he not, but rush'd upon their town, And swept the whole, defended by their Brown! These deeds make dark what Nelson ever doneâ The loftiest captain of the English throneâ Outshine the victories of Hillyar, Brookâ Redeeming all that Perry from us took On Erie's floodâsome crazy vessels thereâ The whole Republick rings with the affairâ The same would be to take a royal hare. âI feel that I must pause: 'Twould waste the night, Should I attempt thy honours to recite.â He ended. Thus the king: âIt gives Us joy To hear you tell how We Our foes destroy. But now relate, how Henry holds his course To bribe New-Albion to admit Our force.â His manner show'd concern: The Fiend began: âDread Sovereign! name him notâa treacherous man! Lo, by the influence of the tempting gold, He every purpose to betray them sold.ââ âSold!ânot possible! What, New-Albion gone? Our hopes are blastedâlostâforever done! Disaster crowns disaster! Why did We Send such a serpent-traitor o'er the sea? Our faithful friends will smother up their faceâ This, this defeats Usâcover'd with disgrace!â His passion chok'd the passage of his breath: âToo rapid are thy fearsâ'twill prove their death! Noânot a friend that offer'd Us their hand, Of whom is Strong, the bulwark of the land, Believes your Majesty would send a spy To alienate their hearts from Libertyâ But they behold it as a luring art, Contriv'd by Madison of murderous heart, That their affections might from thee withdraw, And league with him to prosecute the war: Hence, they more keen his purposes deride, And far more stable in their faith abide. âAt my departure with the rapid wind, Convention of the States employ'd their mind. Perhaps the moment now, while yet I speak, A fated blow to Libertyliberty they strike. Lo, this Convention will divide the chain, Which long hath barr'd thee from thy rightful reignâ When sunder'd is the link, with ease thy hand Will sway the royal sceptre o'er the landâ A laud so vast, its very lakes would float The British Isle as some inferior moat.â As they themselves the savages subdu'd, By arming these to shed the others' blood, So one part aiding, you'll the other cast, And then, with Alfred will thy name be class'd:â The Fiend was silent. Thus rejoin'd the King: âSweet sounds thy voice as musick's softest string. Their civil broils will break their union chain, And soon We'll rule them colonies again! Never, no more for China they rebelâ Hard on their neck will We impress Our heel. âBut ere you came, intelligence We heard Which more alarm'd Us than the lifted swordâ 'Twas a deep plan invented by Monroe, To class and draw an army from the plough! Should this become perfected into law, Then, not too soon would We Our flag withdrawâ Instruct Our ministers conven'd at Ghent, To sign their proffer'd peace and be content, And stay hostilities. Allâall is lostâ Yeaâall the victories that now We boast! Tell Us, Sir Knight, if aught that thou hast heard Of this We speakâa double-edged sword!â Thus he. And thus the counterfeited Fiend: âMonroe breathes warâin every lookâa Fiend. His scheme at first intimidated allâ For in its passage we foredoom'd our fallâ But while despairingâprovidential fate!â To save our cause, arose an advocateâ His name was suited to the taskâ'twas Kingâ Or Scott, or Byron will his praises sing: For, by his eloquentâalarming voice, He prov'd the plan the veriest tyrant's choiceâ Proclaim'd it conscriptâmurderâcruelty, That man in arms should for his country die! That sons should cause their mothers' hearts to break, Compell'd to battle for their Freedom's sake! Self immolationâhorrid scenes of deathâ Spectresâwhose residence is hell beneathâ Were all brought forth in eloquence, a storm Which blank'd the nation to approve the form. âThis effort at conscription, royal Sire! Has added fuel to the factious fireâ Aids their Convention presently to meet To break the league their bondage to complete. YeaâMarylandâa Sovereign-loving State, Has render'd thanks to Briton's advocate! Hence, cast away those cares from off thy browâ Before thy throne, as colonies they'll bow. âKing of the Anchor'd Isle! thy friends thus far, Have strove their might to benefit the war, But all their means are not sufficient strong, To bear their measures with success along: They give thee thanks for ample sums of gold, Scarce in the power of numbers to be toldâ But now, they crave you in their utmost need, Forth to despatch an army to their aid. They pray your Highness to assail Castine, And take possession of the state of Maine, That, should the President attempt to seize Strong, for his love of British monarchies, They might,âsupported with the English force, Divide the Union and resist his course: âThis from the States:âFrom Canada I bear The voice of Prevost to your royal ear,â He pleads you'll send him large divisions o'er. T' invade the nation with o'erwhelming power. âHaving thy foot upon the tyrant's neck, Who made the earth a Golgothaâa wreckâ And chain'd him to a Rock, where the deep howl Of reeling ocean breaks upon his soulâ Now, that this monster of the earth is low, With strength unbroken, thou canst smite the foeâ Advance the Cross resplendent to the sky, And strangle Freedom in its infancy! âBoston, though once thy most ungovern'd child, Illum'd her capitol till Ocean smil'd, And to the height of heaven her fire-trains sent, In proud rejoicings for this grand eventâ Knowing that now no obstacle debars Their ancient Monarch to advance their cause! âHere my commission ends,âwhich brief I've told, That you with wisdom may your plans unfold.â His Highness smil'd, though pleasure mov'd his breast, And this effusion to the Fiend express'd: âElliot, thy words bear musick in their strainâ A gladness dances through my every vein. Your name with laurell'd honours will increaseâ You've steep'd Our bosom in the wine of bliss! âYe nobles, now attend, whilst We express The plan We've laid their Freedom to efface: âDrummond, 'tis thine, with fifty ships to weigh, And on the lakes, your conquerors displayâ In twice ten vessels, Hardy, make Castine, And spread your forces through the State of Maine: Of all New Albion, We create you now, Our faithful viceroy, when to Us they bow. Employ smooth friendshipâno suspicion wake, Till their divisions shall the Union break, Then, with the bayonet, at their bosoms rush, And, at a blow, their Independence crush. No more with them shall Liberty be knownâ Their stubborn joints shall humble to the throne! Their Freedom shall be dust beneath Our feet! Their subjugation shall be made complete! Does not the horse unrein'd at random fly, Snuffing the windâdefiance in his eyeâ But with the curb we make him fear to move, Save in the manner that Our wills approve: Thus will We curb their wild licentiousness, Till they, as subject, shall Our Crown confess. âWhat molesâhow blind in feuds to disunite, By which, with ease, We conquer in the fight. They flattering think We nurse them in Our heart, And so We do, for poison to impart. By civil broils We'll sever one by one, Till We shall reignâtheir Liberties undone! âThe time that Hardy holds New Albion there, Strength must be brought against the South to bear: âCockburn, new-grac'd with honours from thy king, From the Bermudas at return of spring, Against Virginia, move with fire and swordâ Beckwith, and Ross, will sail your fleet on board. âAnd noble Packenham with Cochrane, sail With Spain-proud veterans to the same fair Isle. Keene, Gibbs, and Lambert, will your chiefs compose To sack Orleans, and every outlet close To western governments. Drummond, pursue, Routing the foe till you the north subdue; By which We'll hold them in the Lion's grasp, Till the young Hydra shall convulsive gasp, Strangling in death! Then, glorious shall We reign From shore to shore, and sweep the earth's domain!â Seated, the Monarch his commands express'd, And each withdrew with royal favours grac'd, Ready at day to cleave the ocean west. At length, the silver gates of light unfold, And sweet-ey'd Morn, array'd in spotless gold, Comes dancing forth with all her laughing train Of Joys and Lovesâthe deities that reign In heaven's delicious hourâfilling the round Of full creation with inspiring sound. The regal multitude embark their ships, And plough with crooked keels the curling deeps. Drummond proceedsâhalf savage in his soul, To gain the lakes and overcome the whole, York and the Mountain State. Hardy, serene, Directs his compass for the port Castine. Cochrane, and Packenham, with thousands vast, For the Bermudas cleave the watery waste. Ross, Warren, Beckworth, Cockburn, and the rest, Cut the green ocean, sailing south by west. The Fiend, in shape of Elliot, bade farewell, And then resum'd his lineaments of hellâ Hied to the mountain, like a passing cloud, To give commissions to his Stygian crowd. Now at the time, the royal-mantled power Gather'd in troops to leave the Albion shore, The mist of morning floating soft in heaven, At conquer'd George,ârenerv'd for action given, Columbians roseâBrown form'd in marching train, And hasty led them o'er the dew-sown plain. Soon they in sight of Erie's fort advance, Where in the breeze the English standards dance. Th' opposing walls, Scott, Ripley, Boyd, surroundâ Morters explode, and bursting bombs rebound. The forted soon at the command of Buck,â Who held the monarch's nameâthe Lion struck. The Eagle rises in her pride of state, While Freedom Stars the heavens illuminate. In ready barges, Stockton bears the foe Across the lake, and lands at Buffaloe. Scarce Stockton pass'd the wave, when lo, in sight, A yawl shines o'er the liquid mirror light, In which, through space unknown, two chiefs appear And Brown to Ripley broach'd their character: âWhat boat comes leaping o'er the lake afar? Some message,âI presume from Shelby's war. Since Perry plac'd his name in brilliance high, Brightening through ages till eternity, Nothing relating to the army west, Hath reach'd my ear to give me interest.â This scarce was utter'd, when they made the shoreâ Campbell, and Woodâhearts finish'd to the coreâ Campbell, at Mississinewa with flame, Had made the wildness of the savage tame; Wood held affections to each patriot dear, Skill'd in the art the bulwark mound to rear. A salutation having pass'd with each, Campbell began with animated speech: âBehold, to you I glorious tidings bear, Which gives my heart new pleasure to declare. âShelby, immortal, hath sublim'd the Thames, Crowning with quenchless light a host of names! Foremost of whom, the Johnsons stand enroll'dâ Their deeds are worthy to be grav'd in gold. The foe hath felt a retribution justâ The humbled Lion laps the bleeding dust!â He paus'd. This answer was the voice of Brown: âI've heard with ravishment thy great renown! The deeds of Shelby nothing can surpassâ His name is written nor in stone nor brass, Which time corrodes insensible to dustâ But in the heasts of all the brave and just! Nor will the Johnson Character decay While virtue warms life's animated clay. âYou'll now remain and aid our efforts hereâ We'll strive to move in Shelby's proud career. Campbell, thy name is number'd with the good, Take thou th' Eleventh RegimentâAnd Wood, This fort establish new.â âRumour hath said, That peace in Europe whelms our Freedom dead; That England now with all her strength will come, And, at a blow our Liberties consumeâ But something whispers me like sainted faith, That we our efforts will make good in death. To meet this cloud that's gathering from the east, Here we'll abide, till numbers are increas'd.â As Brown to each commission'd had assign'd, They take their stations resolute in mindâ Wood shows his judgment by his skilful lines, And every chief commends his just designs. Brown moves from battery to bastion round With silent tongue, but speaking eye profound. A glance suffices to express his mind, As on he passes by the work design'd; Though not unfrequent where the labour smokes, A smile approving brightens in his looks: So active beavers with prudential care, When autumn comes and strips the forest bare, Like brothers in affliction, harmonize To raise a shelter from inclement skies: Part, with their teeth, young alders fell to earth, While others to the stream convey them forth, And span them o'er the flood. Others, at hand, Bury the spoils against them in the sandâ Part gather leaves and autumn's yellow grass To dam the hurrying water in its passâ While others, timber for the sills provide, Which firm they fix superior to the tideâ All without tumult ply their different partsâ A unity of hands, a unity of hearts. The elder beaver, wise through lapse of years, Directs the labour and the labourer cheers: Equal excitement stimulates the free, To trench and wall against the enemyâ And, like the beaver honour'd with command, Brown eyes the workâencourages the band. While thus for thirty suns they held their toil, Warriors assembled to defend the soil: The veteran Swift, whose locks were hoary white, Had nobly fought the Revolution fight. And Gaines, Virginia's son, in song to dwell, For his defending of the fort so well. MacNiel, and Harrison, Jessup, Leavensworthâ And Crocker, Ketchum,âvaliant from their birth. Brady, and Gibson, whose proud bosoms glow'd To do such deeds as Time could ne'er corrode. These names and others for the cause as one, Unite to do the purposes of Brown. But who approaches by himself alone? 'Tis he, whose heart is like a marble stone, When burns the strifeâbut when the flame is o'er, Forgiving mercy softens every poreâ Miller!âno other could it be. At Tip'canoe, The savage backward from his presence flewâ Fix'd at Magagaw like a tower he stood, And made Earth's bosom red with hostile blood; But Hull, the traitor, yielded up the braveâ Since which dark period, in a dungeon grave He'd been immur'dâremote from man and heavenâ But he for Barclay in exchange was given. Brown clasps the warriorâbinds him to his breastâ And after pausingâhis full soul express'd: âMy friendâmy brotherâin the field of fame!â Thy country speaks thy honour with acclaim! What happy fortune gives thee to my heart? My tongue is slow my feelings to impart! Oft hath my bosom felt a widowhood, To think the sufferings of thy solitude. To thy command the Twenty-First I giveâ Thy worth alone would cause its name to live.â Thus he. And Miller then: âFrequent I've heard, Though deep endungeon'd, of thy potent sword, Yes, by their whisperings with a pausing check, I glean'd thy deeds, though prison'd at Quebec,â Where thither we were borne in triumph down, When Hull disgraceful knelt before the crown. Brock was a soldier generous and humaneâ I partial wept to hear the warrior slain; But when that we to others were consign'd, Scarce one possess'd a nobleness of mind. On as we pass'd with torture at our heart, They sharp'd unfeeling the transfixing dart. But what severe ran burning through our blood, Was as we sigh'd our sorrows on the road Through Montrealâto strike our nation's air! It seem'd each note would cut my bosom bare! I cannot speak the pain!âWe'll stay the themeâ But it shall edge my sword with death's pale gleam!â This said. He hied him to his post assign'd, No feeling earthly, habiting his mind. While thus defensive stands the strength of Brown. Drummond arrives to tread the nation downâ Enters the Lawrence with his streamers proudâ And ships on ships in gloomy prospect crowd, Like clouds that sweep successive over heaven, When by the violence of tempests driven. They blaze their thunders as they pass Quebecâ And still ascend, till shallow waters check Their farther progress up the narrowing flood.â Swift they debark a thronging multitude, Crowding the path with vengeance in their eye, Like red clouds kindling in the morning sky. Drummond consults at Kingston with Prevost, The manner to invade the Freedom coast. By which consult, Drummond, to gain renown, Is first to conquer the unconquer'd Brown. From Kingston, Yeo bears him up the lake, And lands at York, the free to overtake. On the next morn, the sun ascending bright, Sheffie arriv'd at York in meagre plightâ His head dishevelledânaked to the airâ And beard obscene, and eye with hollow glare. Long had he stray'd bewilder'd through the wood, To fly the shadow of the scalp of blood. The want of food reduc'd him to his mind, As clouds, thin wasted, leave no shade behind. In this low misery, he Drummond foundâ Riall, and other characters around: âDrummond! I'm famish'dâsinking with the dead! My royal brother, quick provide me bread!â Give with the bread the purple draught divineâ My soul is faintingâO restore with wine! Death knocks upon my heartââ âWhat wretch are you, Who thus unblushingly for favours sue? Is this the cast of beggars o'er the flood To claim relationship with royal blood? Begoneânor dare thy starving suit to urge, Or thou shalt feel the smarting of the scourge!â âI call'd thee brotherânot allied by blood, But by my title, equally as good. Thou must remember when we fought in Spainâ The same ship bore us o'er the tossing main. You, Sheffie must rememberâsure you must, Though bare, and starving, and begrimm'd with dust!â Drummond observ'd him with a closer eye, And scann'd his features through his poverty: âAnd do I view in such debasing plight, My proud associate in the field of fight? You must have fled the dungeon. Forth declare! They must have starv'd thee with dishonour'd fare. Speakâtell me allâBut stayâth' attendants bring Wines of rich flavourâviands nourishing.â The starving Sheffie with devouring look, Void of a choice, the readiest cheer partook; For biting hunger throws restraint aside, Scorning the pimps of fashionable pride. At length, his violence of hunger stay'd, To Drummond, he this deep deception said: âYeo, heart-contracting cruelty I've seen From those unmerciful, half savage men. To arms o'erpowering, I was forc'd to yieldâ Down from my horse they dragg'd me o'er the field. My sword was lost as on the earth I fellâ My helmetâas they drew me by the heel. Five days they perish'd meâfar worse than we Ever reduc'd their sailors on the sea. âThus wretched were my sufferings, till the sun Five tedious circles round the heavens had run, When lo, a larum sounded in the night,â Amidst the tumult I made good my flight. In safety soon I pass'd beyond the crowdâ But found myself bewilder'd in a wood Vast in extent. Three days I drank the flood, Sickening in hope for vitalizing food. Fainting, I felt that death would soon o'erwhelm My failing lifeâbut on the bark of elm I stay'd my ebbing blood. At length, despair Fix'd on my heart, as wolves forsake their lair To howl at midnight! 'neath a sheltering rock, I laid me downâAdieu to life I tookâ I felt Death's hand against my breast to knock! âBut lo, as Venus deck'd the eastern sphere, I heard the welcome voice of chanticleer! I started at the soundâfor well I knew A shelter was at hand, which thrill'd me through. âI gain'd the cottage gate as dawn'd the lightâ How beat my heart with transport exquisite! But fate pursu'd me stillâIn twilight dark, Two wolf-like dogs commenc'd a surly bark, And sprang to seize me in their pointed teeth! Backward I flewâand strong appear'd my breathâ For though exhausted with fatigue and pain, The pressing danger call'd my strength again. âOnce more I wander'd, weary and forlornâ The spark of life just brightening to be gone. The path obscure, with fainting, slow I trod, And soon I found me on the open road. I heard the rumbling of a drum remote, And stood, and hearken'd breathless to the note, Cautious I follow'd whence the echo came, To learn, or friend, or enemy, the name. A dance of joys came rushing on my mind, To mark the Cross exalted in the wind! âI now, in part, my history have told,â But O, my sorrows have been manifold!â He ceas'd. And Drummond with impassion'd heat: âI'll grind them fineâyeaâdust beneath my feet! Insulting to Nobility! O tellâ Swiftâbrief declare, where darkening they conceal, That I at once their power may overcome, And every village with a fire consume!â Sheffie with hasty accent: âBroke by despair, My mind bewilder'd, scarce can tell you whereâ At Little Yorkâ âBut who approaches nigh? Vincent! minute thy will to satisfy.â Scarce these expressions said, when Vincent came, By future actions to enlarge his name. To Drummond's ear he open'd the defeat Of George surrendering 'neath the Eagle's height; And then describ'd the character of Brown, Sweeping from Erie's fort their banner down. Drummond stood kindling as he gave the word, And in his passion seiz'd upon his sword: âAnd who is Brown you character so high? His strength before us will be infancy! âRiall, proceed with your division forth, And search this Brown and rout him from the north; Holt, Holland, Wallbeck, Eldridge, Woodville, Keithâ The Marquis, Dyott, Gordon, Plenterleathâ Names battle-proofâwill second your design To break their ranks, or fort to undermine, And when I measures ample shall devise, Forth I shall move to lead the enterprize.â Riall, the instant of the order, rose, And mounted with an air that valour showsâ Marshall'd his legionsâwheel'd them to the west, And march'd with triumph looming in his breast. He held his progress, till the radiant sun, Had thrice effulgent o'er creation run; But on the fourthâthron'd in meridian high, Darting his golden arrows from the sky, He reach'd the Chippewaâits northern bankâ Halted in line, by wheeling each his rank. They pitch their campment and its front defend, T' observe the ground ere farther they ascend. The meantime Riddle with a jealous eye, Wide scour'd the land invasion to descry. As fleet he cours'd along Niagara's flood, He kenn'd th' approaching of the Albion blood. He clomb a hillâthere saw them trench the fieldâ And then, for Erie swift his charger steel'd. Leaving the wind, regain'd he soon the fortâ Enter'dâto Brown deliver'd the report: âLo, as I scouted by Niagara's tide, Distant a cloud of heavy dust I spied, Thickening and blackening as I urg'd my wayâ Veiling from earth the blazing noon of day. Gaining the summit of a hill, mine eyes Beheld a scene that aw'd me with surprise. Broad o'er the plains, beyond my utmost ken, As thick as moving swarms were Albion men! They seem'd like clouds red lowering in the sky, Dipp'd in the crimson of the solar dye. âAs they advanc'dâback I retreated slow, Tracing minute each motion of the foe. At length, upon the Chippewa they stood, Rough in their armsâa threatening multitude. Though far remoteâyet aided by my glass, I saw them run their lines along the grass. The earth they wounded as I rein'd my steed To bear to you th' intelligence with speed, Pregnant with lowering warâere on the earth, From leaden urns night pour'd its darkness forth.â Brown sat in silence at the news he brought, His brows close knitâimmers'd in pondering thought: So sits a stately lion in his den, When from afar he hears the cry of men, And dogs, half wolf, come dashing through the wood To drench the earth with his unconquer'd blood. His whelps and lioness beside him stand To hear his voice and move at his command. He weighs what plan will answer him the bestâ His tongue is silent, while his labouring breast Deep rolls from thought to thoughtâwhether to out And meet the huntersâhis assailants rout, Or on defensive, in his cave to stand,â Muster his strength to overcome the bandâ By turns he starts,âdepress'd his shaggy brows, While his deep eye a lowering meteor shows: So Brown sat pondering with his head declin'dâ At length, abruptly he reveal'd his mind: âTo Ripley's ear in secrecy, alone, Make the advancing of the English known. Bid him the troops to sleep upon their arms, And sentries double, for the night alarms.â Brief the commissionâRiddle wheel'dâretir'd, And gave the order as the chief desir'd. Brown held his seat unmov'd within his tentâ His every thought upon the subject bent, While the wax tapers by their lengthening wick, With doubtful glimmerings the pavilion streak. While musing thus, behold, in vision came Fredoniaâclad in the immortal name Of Washington, the wise, the great, the good, With whom, none mortal bear similitudeâ She took the fashion of his lofty heightâ Her brows encompass'd with celestial lightâ Her eye reveal'd the passion of his breast, When kings the terror of his arm confess'd. The soul of Brown was overcome with awe, When deeply wrapp'd in aching thought he saw The vision'd Form!âhe startled with his fearâ His eye roll'd wildâerect, like quills his hair Stood on his head! But soon his joints relax, And all his sinew'd strength melts down like wax: âFear not, my son!âbe not thy soul dismay'dâ Firm on the virtue of thy heart be stay'd, 'Tis for my country from the bless'd abodes, I've bent my flight, where all enjoy as Gods Divine beatitude! Yeaâthee I love, Though in the element of heaven above. âWith sympathy of heart I felt thy pain, Whether to lead thine arms upon the plain, Or stand upon defence: But doubt no moreâ Cautious proceed and meet them with thy power. But I'm restrain'd the future scenes to tell, That thou, unguided may'st thy mind reveal. For ardent battle be thy soul prepar'd. And immortality is thy reward.â She spoke, and vanish'd in a flood of gold, Pure as the beams that seraphim unfoldâ Not like those rays that from the mirror fly, Whose dazzling glance strikes blindness on the eyeâ But soft, luxurious as the brow of evenâ Drawing the gaze of mortal up to heaven. âTranslated Chief!âof honour'd names the first, That ever wore the cumbering robes of dust! How sweet the musick utterance of thy tongueâ Sweet as an angel's in the midst of song! I feel unworthy to be call'd thy son, Wonder of earth!âtranscendent Washington!â A name that Heaven delights to dwell upon!â Brown could no moreâhis every nerve was spentâ With soul o'erpower'd he sunk in languishment: So when Elijah, while the seraph choir Fill'd heaven with anthemsâon the wings of fire Mounted sublime above the stars on high, That zone the footstool of the Deityâ Elisha mark'd his marvellous ascent, Which held his soul in bless'd astonishment. But when fair angels turn'd the gate aside, O'erpower'd with heaven,âhe faintedâpartial died! CANTO XXVI. BATTLE OF CHIPPEWA. ARGUMENT. Brown marches from Fort Erie to Street's Creek .... Skirmishings between the Advance Guard of either Army .... The Battle on the Plains of Chippewa. The scene is laid at the above-mentioned places .... The time is about thirty-six hours. A doubtful twilight lines the hills with grayâ But soon the Morning brightens into day,â A virgin smiling with the eye of love, Thus sweet she blushes, clad in vestments wove Of silver clouds, by angel forms on high, In chambers hung with heavenly tapestry. When day effulgent quicken'd in the skies, The patriots rose for martial exerciseâ But when the tidings struck upon their ear, Of Riall, fortified with thousands near, They felt as standing on a precipice, Which caus'd a freezing of their blood, like ice, Till Brown in centre of the columns rode, And this proud language on their hearts bestow'd: âLook every eye at heaven!âits beams invite Our banners to unfold to meet the fight! Be men, be warriors, equal to your birth, And fear no foe that treads upon the earth. What though in thronging multitudes they come, With bold intent to smite us to the tomb, Yet ever keep in memory, ye brave, Where kings are rulers, man is but a slave. And what's a slave? an animal, the worst, That creeps the earthâa thing supremely curst! But Freedom is your boon! For this, ye toilâ For Independence of your birth-right soilâ Not slavish hirelings, train'd to massacre, But Freemen, battling for the character,â Far from the thraldom of a slave to live, And to your children,âpure the blessing give The tree of Liberty, of golden fruitâ Vigorous,âin bloomâunshaken at its root! âHave ye not faith to overcome in war, Those who for Kings unsheath the scimitar? I feel your thoughts!âto wield the sword with powerâ On heaven's own breath the Eagle's wing shall tower!â As when fierce Sirius in his drought comes forth, And drinks the vital moisture of the earth, The trees, exhausted of the limpid springs, Hang down their heads with mournful sorrowingsâ A shower descendsârich with the sweets of heaven! To every plant a quickening life is givenâ The trees from languor, in their verdure rise, And wave their heads in honour to the skies: So rose the patriots from their downcast look, When Brown expressive of his feelings spoke, And fill'd their ears with musick. Soon again, His voice is heard in a commanding strain: âHow my soul glories to behold you now, Fiz'd in resolve to make their standards bow; And on the tablet of remembrance live, While from yon orb the earth shall light receive! âGaines, to your care the fortress is resign'dâ Watch every pass with jealousy of mind. Morgan, with rifles will our rear defend From lurking scouts as we the path descend. Scott, in the van, your bold battalions leadâ Towson, in centre, with your brass proceed. Ripley, whose sword was bar'd with Covington, Guide your division to the combat on. Hindman, move nextâPorter, your volunteers Advance, to give them life beyond their years. Swift, with a brow that tells of wintry age, Lead to the field their standards to engage. âNow let the drums the marching musick strike! Warriors, be mindful of the name of Pike!â Each with impatience heard. The whistling fife, And maddening drum, excite the soul to strife. They step the beat with bosoms kindling fire, Lifted above mortality's desire. Bright on their burnish'd steels the beams of day Glance, wheel, and flash with vividness awayâ And, as the streamers in the breeze unfold, They sweetly lace them with the threads of gold. As Venus glitter'd on her eastern throne, Riall to Gordon made his movements known: âBy what have I of the Columbians heard, They wield like veterans a destroying sword. Stubborn the truthâtheir manner in the fight Too often on our tongues hath sounded light, Hence, I with caution shall their lines assail, That when we strike, our bayonets may prevail. âThis to accomplish, instant you'll repair To the next stream of rapid character; Bulwarks erect, where o'er it spans an archâ No hostile banner suffer there to march; For should the pass our enemies command, 'Twould for a time compel us to a stand.â Gordon, swift wheeling with his train departs, All like himself possess'd of valiant hearts. And as the sun sprinkles with gold the wood, They gain the bridge that overspans the flood. With trench and mound they fortify its bank, Should Brown approach his columns to disrank. When stood the sun in zenith of his height, The Cross its upper folds half wav'd in sight Of Riddle's bandâin royal arrogance, As they proceeded in the bold advance. And soon by Scott at distance were descried The new-pil'd works, which him a pass denied. When Scott severe, th' obstructing foe beheldâ The banners and the plumesâthe rest conceal'd, Crocker, and Towson, he commanded forthâ Warriors whose bosoms held a gem of worth: âYour cannon, Towson, plant on yonder ridge With cedars shaded o'er,âand clear the bridge. Crocker, in secret pass the stream above, Ready the compass of your heart to prove. At favour'd moment with the steel descend, When Towson from its height their flag shall bend.â Scarce his tongue's echo on the air had died, When forward wheel'd the heroes in their prideâ Towson his cannon planted on the ridge, Which, by its height, o'erlook'd th' opposing bridge, And on the foe such conflagration cast, That soon precipitate he fled the blast. But Gordon drew his swordâthe flight suppress'd: âAnd hold you nothing valiant in your breast? Whence was this paleness?âwhere? The bridge set fires! He, who shall shrink, with infamy expires!â Threat'ning he spoke, and back in anger strodeâ His cohort follows to the scene of blood. Reckless of Towson's thunders from the ridge, With lighted brands they rush upon the bridge! In vain his deep explosions thin his foesâ Others advancing the battalion close. The arch is lost in flameâbut in its stead, A bridge remains compos'd of numbers dead. But this, unknown, had Crocker pass'd the stream, And at their life clanc'd the sheeted flame; Full on their rear, as they retreat commenc'd, And to the foe his courage evidenc'd. Gordon his charger rein'dâto Harvey thus, A chief of mounted warriors valorous: âChargeâwall them with steel! Let your falchion gleam And show its lightning edge! From o'er the stream, No succour can relieve them! Strike them downâ Their standard bent subjected to the crown.â Scarce Harvey waited the concluding word, When forth his squadron to the charge he spurr'd, Each bending o'er the field a threatening swordâ Their numbers hem the fewâthe patriot few, And strive with falchion point to pierce them through. They strive in vain!âIn martial square firm lock'd, The Spartan band resist the charge unshock'd. Like ridge of steel the Albions wall them roundâ Republick warriors,âkingly, press the ground. Crocker, no longer able to withstand The pressing weight, proclaims with lifted brand: âBreak down the circleâwith the bayonet, break! Stand with the soul erect! The effort make! Shelter in yonder cottage! Charge or dieâ Think not of yielding, till the heart is dry!â He scarce had finish'd, when the foe was broke, So full of death was the impetuous stroke! Thus, when the natives from Ohio came T' explore Kentucky in pursuit of game, They lit in circle round the grass with fire, To cause their hunt, converging to retireâ Bears, wolves, and panthers compass'd with their death, Snuff'd at the blaze, and blew it with their breath. As back reluctant, by the flames repell'd, Their bristling backs their desperate hearts reveal'dâ 'Twas death to lingerâdriven to despair, They pierc'd the flames, and gain'd the open air: So Crocker's band, determin'd ne'er to yield, Cut throughâand gain the freedom of the field, Arms dripping blood, they to the cottage hie, While tramping on their rear the enemy! Shelter'dâfire bathes the foe! Th' imperial pride Sinks to the earth with slaughter satisfied. They break and scatter from the wasting scene, Leaving subdu'd their stoutest-hearted men. Crocker returns rejoicing in his fame, For loud, and far, was echo'd forth his name. The arch the patriots presently rebuild, And in due order camp upon the field. Each in position govern'd by his rankâ And soon their bulwarks line the streamlet's bank. The meantime Gordon with his band repass'd The Chippewa, with meddling thought harrass'd. With heavy brow he enter'd Riall's tent, And circumstantial told the late event. âFreedom advances like a hurrying flame! Lo, I return, compell'd to leave the stream! But ere they won the field, 'twas mark'd with bloodâ The spanning arch, that leap'd the narrow flood, Was, in despite of death with kindled brand Set fire!âbut there no longer could we stand. Back I withdrew. The foe by valour led Pursu'd with violence to strike us dead. Harvey impetuous charg'dâbut they at length Sunder'd his linesâsought shelter for their strength, Then smote his ranks in turnâAnd, bleeding thus, Defeated, we return calamitous. âStrong must our swords be drawn. This they'd assail'dâ Yeaâthis encampment, had our courage fail'd, And not the arch consum'd but fled the streamâ Their thrusting steel had wak'd us in our dream.â âWhat, conquer'd us while dreaming?â Riall cries, âNever Britannia from Columbia flies! I'll pass the Chippewa at dawn's first gleam, And prove to Brown, our banners are supreme! What, in the dreaming hour assaulted thus, By those of yesterday? preposterous! Neverâno, never will arrive the hour, Albion will shrink to meet array'd their power.â When wheels of nature backward shall revolve, Then may Britannia on the field dissolveâ When the sun rises from the mountains west, Then may the Lion be by them depress'd. âHolland! this order circulate aroundâ At the fourth watch to form upon the groundâ Lo, ere another sun retires to rest, We draw the blood from out the Eagle's breast!â His gallant aid receiv'd the mandate,ârode To each battalionâhis intentions show'd. And now the shadows silent-footed creep Slow to the east,âwhile down the heavenly steep The sun descending spreads his yellow hair, Waving with gold, delicious through the air. Ocean receives himâand the Stars from urns, Pour down their light rejoicing in their turns. This charge Brown, Austin, gave: âWith wakeful eyes, See all secur'd against a night surprise. Let guards increas'd upon the lines appear, While no loud whisper strikes the Night's damp ear. The countersign is Pikeâ(to heaven transferr'd,) In softest breathings pass the secret word. See every warrior rests upon his arms, Ready to rise at notice of alarms. When morn's bright virgin Morning Star. shall the east salute, Let all be waken'd in their silence muteâ Harness'd for battle by their standards form, At night's departure on the foe to storm.â Th' instructions given, forth leap'd the youthful aid, And spoke the orders as the chief had saidâ The outward guards are strengthen'd round the camp, Their hearkening ear inclin'd, should foeman's tramp Approach in nightâto catch the rustling sound, And spread the 'larum through the campment round. And now, as chanticleer with high note shrill, Salutes the day-star lovely on her hill, The Albions rise and pass the murmuring stream, As golden hair-threads on the mountains gleam And glitter on the earth. Each hostile van Begins the war with man oppos'd to man. As press the royals, so the free retire, Blazing at intervals death's withering fire. Now five times twenty with o'erpowering weight, Crowd against fifty in command of Treat,â Yet stands the hero as with laurel crown'd, And nerves his band to consecrate the ground; âStand fastâunwinkingly at death!â He said, And many a foe was check'd with burning lead. Blood dripples from their veins which mads them forth, To bring the files of Treat upon the earth. A swift ball glancing through the waste air free, A patriot warrior brought upon his knee. The wound produc'd alarm! Disgraceful sceneâ Forgot they all they had the hearts of men. Treat strove to stay their fearsâhis efforts vainâ They flew like wild deer frighted o'er the plain. Thus, bent on plunder, wasps in thousands come To drive the bees from their domestick homeâ They send detachment in advance to spy The lines and bulwarks of their enemy. The queen inform'd of the invading host To storm her hiveâher substance to exhaust, Enrols her life guardâboldly they repair T' assail the van and cause them to forbear. They meetâthe queen strews death along her pathâ Yet toil the wasps in violence of wrath. At length, her second on the earth is laidâ A damping chillness on their hearts invadeâ The queen in vain endeavours to excite Their freezing bosoms to sustain the fight. They leave their royal mistress on the plain, Flying with wildness to their cells again: So when the guards their second chief beheld Bleedingâa coward frost their blood-veins chill'd. They fled their leader while he rais'd his arm, Wielding his brand to scatter their alarm. Time offers no delay. The Albions crowdâ Deep o'er the field, their weapons pealing loud. Treat marks the pressing dangerâand with haste Stoopsâand the wounded clasping round his waist, Raisesâand bears him staggering from the plains, While trickling gore the trodden path distains. The outposts skirmish'd till the climbing sun, Stood in the firmament of heaven at noon, But now, to Riall, Brown's position known, Impatient to behold the Star-flag down, He, Gordon thus commanded: âForth awayâ Your veteran warriors will begin the fray. In yonder forest, circle, till you gain Their rear,âthen strike and dash them o'er the plain. âSlow with the army, solid shall I move To keep their thoughts from entering in the grove, Till I your volley on their left shall hear, Then, while distress shall in their ranks appear, Bold on their front will I a charge commence, And make their arms like infants in defence.â Gordon nodded his plumeâhis wonted mood, And led his column to th' embowering wood, Waving on Albion's right, while Riall, slow, Mov'dâbeating musick for deceptious show, Till at the signal he should strike the blowâ While no deep shadow passes o'er his mind, The numbers soon to be to death consign'd. During the movement, in their armour bright, The brave all anxious waited for the fight. Soon gratified are theyâThe jealous Brown Beheld the crimson legion of the crown Advance with Gordon secret through the wood, From a rock eminence, on which he stood: Thus on a mountain cliff an eagle stands, To mark his quarry, while his wing expands Ready to pounce from off his airy tower, Certain, his prey to fasten in his power. Broad he extends his eye with piercing beam, Through plain, o'er mountain, and the passing streamâ And not the motion of a quivering leaf, Escapes his notice from the rocky reef: So Brown upon an eminence beheld The foe's design, though partially conceal'd. Thus to his chiefs around: âThe hour has come To deck your brows with an immortal plumeâ And prove you worthy of your sires at home, Whose memories flourish! Time allows no moreâ For look, the royals on the left wing pour! âNow Porter, test the character of Yorkâ Approach the ambush, and begin the work. Through yon deep valley, heedful guide your trainâ Let not the tremble of a plume be seen, Till unexpected you ascend the brow, Which part conceals them from our prospect now,â And if it's possible, their rear you'll gain, Ere with alarm you fill their hearts with pain. âYoung Spencer, haste, and bid the outguards slow, Back to recede before the advancing foe, That Riall may receive his overthrow:â When Porter's onset sounds with clamorous din, With Riall's self will we the fight begin.â Few were his wordsâNo more his chiefs require, Within whose bosoms dwelt the sacred fire, Which loom'd their ancestors to raise on high The Eagle banner, gemm'd with Liberty. Spencer dash'd forward to the scouts afar, And to the centre bade them to withdraw, And with bold art allure the Riall force, By frequent vollies to pursue their course. Porter, the meantime, soft conducts his men Along the valeâno plume, nor standard seen By Gordon's infantry, whose bosoms beat With proud expectance Freedom to defeat. While in this hope, lo, Porter climbs the brow Of the concealing hill, and makes their blood to flow! Thus while a band of hunters scour the woods O'er hill and daleâalong the truant floodsâ In a deep dell, at length, they glad descry A grazing herd, and plan their destiny. With feet of down the woody slope they bend, And o'er the beetling rocks with care descendâ Hope nestles in their bosomsâhearts beat strong, As soft and slow they feel their way along.â Lo, in the act to sight upon the deer, A den of serpents at their feet appear, Their blood congeals, they stand, they shake, they stare, While the quick horror shivers every hairâ But thought returning, with a scream they fly, The serpents leaping in their onmity! So Gordon's host, when Porter rose, and hurl'd A flame that numbers buried from the world, A random volley pour'd upon the air, And shrieking, fled with feelings of despairâ Porter pursu'd them to the open plain, Leaving his path made gory with the slain. But Gordon soon was frenzy to its heightâ Mildness prov'd vain his legions to exciteâ To join in column and maintain the fight: âDestroy the dastardâlet his name be dead, Who dares beyond me!âbow to earth his head! Raiseâraise the flag!âthe ranks consolidate, And show resistance with o'erpowering weight.â As broken waves behind a rock are stay'd, So round their chief they gather in brigade, And bending forward with their hearts in glow Their flag to rescue from an overthrow. On Porter now the balls with quick-fire singâ Two shiver at a glance the hand of Kingâ (His wound yet open where his thigh was rent, When George's banner from its height was bent.) The arteries sunder'd of his wrist in twainâ Through loss of blood he faints upon the plain. Never the drops of Freedom stream aloneâ A lead obliquely passing, split the bone Of Gordon's better leg from heel to knee, And cleft his foot, and pierc'd his charger free. The war-horse felt the stingâand toss'd his headâ Rear'dâand with fury bounded o'er the deadâ Deep in the dust his wounded rider castâ His foaming nostril show'd his life was pass'd. But while his power remain'd to keep his breath, He flewâthen fell and yielded up to death. Again the Albions from resistance flyâ And Porter follows in his chivalry. The meantime Riall, his division hard Pursu'd the trail of the Columbian guard, Which slow gave back, as Brown by Spencer said, Toward the centre of his bulwark dread: Not otherwise a fox by hounds pursu'd, To guard her burrow, leaves the chosen wood, Where lie her young, embower'd in solitudeâ Swift as she winds eccentrick o'er the heath, She with deep art conducts them to the teeth Of druling wolves beneath a rocky steep, Where oft she'd pass'd them growling in their sleep; Lo, in the act to lead them to the cave, Where the gaunt wolves with empty hunger rave, Ready to seize and be at once their graveâ They at a distance hear a shriekâand standâ Renounce the chace, their safety to command: So even thus, the guard receded back, Riall t' allure the bulwark to attack, Where each stood ready in their arms for death, Prepar'd their falchions in his breast to sheathâ But when the brave with Porter, on their right, Met Gordon's host and put them to the flight, With heart in check he listen'd to the soundâ Abrupt these orders from his tongue rebound: âHearken! what peal comes thundering from the right? Stand in your place!âBehold, a reddening light Gordon involves!âWheel on the centre flag!âAdvance! From this disaster yield deliverance. Exchange the left and right! reverse the lineâ Hark! the strife thickens! Riveted, combine To do, or die in battle! Each reveal That his heart's valour is a plate of steel!â A moment paus'd his hostâthen, chang'd their form, And forth advanc'd to quench the fiery storm, Kindled to violence, the heart to sear, While constant thunders roll'd along the sphere. They reach'd the distant wood as Gordon bled, And his battalion from the combat fled. On Porter now, the whole their strength uniteâ Redoubling peals proclaim the rising fightâ Yet still the free th' unequal strife maintain, Like planted pillars that defy the main. Back Spencer cours'd the fieldâand thus to Brown: âThe guards approach, alluring Riall on, Yea, as the mandate to my car you gave, They battle and retreat with bosoms brave; And, as you scann'd the tempting of the foe, Solid they come with darkness on their brow!â âAnd let them come!â Brown with a glow replies,â A deathless spirit pouring from his eyes. âLet thousands comeâlet thunders rock the pole, The sight, the sound, will elevate the soul! Do not your bosoms beat like harmony, To hear of their approach? They come to die Beneath the Stars' effulgency! The volunteers Have swept the hills! whose names, like gems the spheres, Will deck their country's brow with radiant lightâ âStand without whisper, till I speak the fight. Shrink not in thoughtâyea, rather press the ground, And stain it deep with crimson,âraise a moundâ An altar worthy Libertyâ âListâHark! What peal comes thundering from the forest dark? âRiall hath chang'd position on the fieldâ His arms engag'd, the battle-din hath swell'd. âScott, wheel thy warriors rapid o'er the bridge, And, like a flame upon a mountain ridge, Burning to heaven, join action with the foeâ Bring him to battle on the plains below. Towson, proceed upon his right extremeâ On yonder batteries let your cannon flame, And smother them of fire. With honour crown'd, Miller, and Ripley, stand upon the ground, Holding your veterans in reserve, till I Shall give you notice, or to live or die.â Scott heard the summonsâpresently he wheel'd In files, his warriors to the martial field. Towson's position was the right of Scott, To wing the globes with riving lightnings hot. Miller, and Ripley, in a solid band Reserv'dâupon the plains of Chipp'wa stand. Scott, brief his column halted on the field, To different chiefs their stations he reveal'd. âLeavensworth, thy place of action is the rightâ There wilt thou hold the honour of the fight. Campbell, thy cohorts to the centre move, And do such deeds as ages will approve. Jessup, let Porter have thy swift defence, Whose name is rising to magnificence. The moment will no moreâ âHark! to the soundâ Porter must giveâor fail upon the ground!â The chiefs immediate to their posts withdraw, Their brows o'ercast with gathering clouds of war. When Riall heard their deep approaching tread, To harkâhe turn'd instinctively his headâ At once, he saw the Eagle sweep along, Defended with a ridge of bayonets strong. His dexter wing he to the Marquis gave, To war with Porter and his strength outbrave. This doneâhe wheel'd his army on the plainsâ Instant the battle in its fury reigns! Reverberating thunders sound afarâ Scott burns a comet, through the ranks of war Rejoicing in his course! And Riall stands A rock in ocean 'gainst the Freedom bands. The strife increasing, dust is seen to rise Like clouds,âwhile flames are mounting to the skies: Thus when th' effulgent orb through Cancer moves Drinking the moistureâperishing the groves, Which cloth'd with verdure Carolina's plains, But now turn'd sallow from long-absent rainsâ Where travellers late had pass'd away the night, Smother'd from air, beneath the ashes white Lurk'd seeds of hidden fire. Behold, at noon, When pois'd in even scales abides the sun, The northern whirlwinds dash the sparkles round, Kindling the stubbleâflickering o'er the groundâ Touching the pines, the flames in wreaths ascend, And with the outrag'd elements contendâ The smoke convolving, the creation blinds, The tumult rising with the maddening winds. Broad-wandering over heaven, the cinders roll With noise like far-off thunders round the pole: Thus dire the scene. Nor this, nor that will yield, Whilst Havock grimm'd with blood stalks dreadful o'er the field. Lo, Campbell, fainting on the dust is laidâ Through his thigh artery the rent is made, Drawing the vital current from his breast, Which, with quick throbbing flutters into rest. His aids alighted when they saw their chief Weltering in blood, to minister reliefâ To bear him backward from the growing strifeâ To give him to those hands that oft redeem to life. The dying hero bade them to withdraw: âThink not of meâbut urge the pressing war! Speak not of surgery. My head lies soft, To mark the beaming of the Stars aloft! Humble the foeâHere, with a smile I dieâ Cherubick boon!âO, glorious luxury!â His sword drops from his handâopensâshuts his eyesâ Opens them againâthey closeâhe diesâ A beam of heaven descended to the earth, And to his spirit gave celestial birthâ His body cover'd with the battle, while His lips in death were fasten'd on a smile. Yet nature calls for the abundant tearâ Malvina mourns her fallen husband dear. But O, fair mourner! think upon his bedâ He sleeps in glory with the mighty dead! Yea, on a bed more soft his brow is laid, Than yet for bridal bliss was ever madeâ Perfum'd and blushing with a waste of flowers, Rich as the bed of love in Eve's delicious bowers! Thy husband's head lies far more soft than thisâ He died with honour in a trance of bliss! MacNiell his station in the war suppliedâ And play'd oblique like, flanking on their side. Holland regardless felt a stinging lead, While half his royal ranks were either broke or dead. With equal valour, Leavensworth the right Maintainsâthickening the rising tumult of the fight. Though openly expos'd to batteries' aim, He stands soul-centred in the midst of flame. Now sinks the gallant Harrison in blood, Who bold the thunders' violence withstood. His knee is fractur'd with an iron globe, Yet still his bosom feels no failing throb. Thus Leavensworth: âSoft bear him from the field!â âNo:â he exclaims, âso long as I can wield This blade in face of heaven, I'll nerve my men, And with mine eyes enjoy the glorious scene! None to my aidance shall forsake his post, If Death should seize me with his hand of frost!â This said, he wav'd his gleaming steel sublime: âHeroes! strike home! eclipse the deeds of time!â Thrill'd with his voice and animating look, As though a spirit out of heaven had spoke, The right division cloth'd themselves with flames, And made the earth look pale with royal names! Scott shone a burning meteor on the field, As though his breast a deity conceal'dâ And Riall, lowering in the height of storm, Commanded when to stand, and when to charge in form. Jessup had gain'd the field upon the left, As Porter's cohorts were of strength bereftâ His presence gave them life! Against the wing, Which now the Marquis held, the death-leads sing, Cutting the air. Porter, and volunteers, With Jessup, stand and conflagrate the spheres. The regal standard flickers to a fallâ The wing recedesâblood streaming prodigal. Riall, perceiving that his right was press'd, To Eldridge, near him, utter'd this behestâ Eldridge, a heart of valour: âLo, they bring Death on our right! Support it slaughtering!â This said, he wheel'd. And Eldridge, at the word, His band advanc'd, the wing to aid afford. But Jessup him through darkening smoke descried, And thus to Ketchum, fighting by his side: âMarkâmark, approaching, yonder ridge of steel To hold their flag from falling! Make them feel Thy bayonets, edg'd with fire! Check their design, And I alone will strive to brave the line.â Ketchum, not waiting for a sand to runâ Led against Eldridge and the fight begun, And check'd his progress, three oppos'd to one! The Marquis soon found Jessup's ranks decreas'd, And forth the utmost of his wrath releas'dâ De Witt, and Palmer, Brimhall, Ketchum, Reedâ And generous Barronâfor their country bleedâ They bleed, and faintâyet live! When years shall come, Silvering their heads with blossoms for the tombâ Their children's children will their scars behold, And, smiling in their tears, their deeds unfold! Jessup observes the wasting of the fieldâ His patriot band to death's commission yieldâ Yea, and his soul in agony of pain, Sees all his efforts at resistance vainâ Yet firm he stands, immoveable, an oak, Round which the thunder-balls had harmless broke. Thought strikes him and he speaks: âWarriors! at glance, Point arms to heaven!âin solid cube, advanceâ Yon proud height attain!â They the word receiv'd, As though his voice immortal they believ'd! Jessup conducts them to the rising ground, Whilst Albion pours a flaming tempest round! Silent they move, like spirits on a cloud, Mid flashing lightnings and deep thunders loud. Half seen through fire, at length they reach the height And play the columnâpour impetuous fight! So restive tygers, hamper'd in a cage, Insulted by the rabbleâhot with rage, Grind fire from their teethâloosenâbreak the bars, And bathe in smoking blood their foaming jaws: Not otherwise, mad Jessup and his train, Surcharg'd with ire, drives death along the plain. The Marquis, wounded, from the field withdrawsâ Soon shrink his legions backward from the cause. Jessup crowds their rearâKetchum joins pursuit, Whose sword had made the tongue of Eldridge mute. Riall perceives the day to him is lost, Unless by effort he could bind his hostâ He dashes through the lines, wielding his brand, Striving, effective, to excite his band: âPut faith upon the bayonet! Plunge the blade! Bindâlockâpress onâand never be dismay'd! Deal not with fireâOn pointed steel relyâ And let the soul wish nothing but to die!â The Albions caught his spiritâand arose, Bristling in steel with Liberty to close. Death grip'd in hand, reckless of life, they pour Against the blazing fieldâraining a shower, Like heaven on Sodom for its lewd excess, Or like a fire that scaths the wilderness!â Now Towson, having still'd the batteries' tongue, Levels his engines on the rushing throng And withers them of lifeâwhile with dead aim, A thousand war-tubes flash dissolving flameâ Columbia stands a burning hill of fireâ The Albions faulterâfrom the scene retire! But not in safety they descend the hillâ Fierce on their rear red death pursues them still! Scott sweeps away the field! They gasp, they dieâ Fire hisses in their blood as back they fly. They dash the Chippewa in broken plightâ Gore floating on its surfaceâswell'd in height, Oppress'dâand groaning with the battle's weight! CANTO XXVII. RIALL'S RETREAT FROM THE CHIPPEWA, &amp;c. ARGUMENT. Riall driven from his position on the Chippewa .... Death of General Swift. The sceneâLittle York, Street's Creek, and on the banks of the Chippewa .... The time is three days. As when fair summer smiles,âthe struggling wind, Long in the chambers of the north confin'dâ At changing of the moon its prison breaksâ Beneath its violence the forest shakes, Thence, down the mountain roars the thundering gust, Darkening the earthâcumbering the fields with dustâ The corn, the flowers, the honey-suckle groves, Where village swains and damsels sigh'd their lovesâ All, all are swept in ruins o'er the heathâ The landscape round is overwhelm'd with death. Here lies a flower just opening into bloom, And there, an oak up-rooted in its doom: Such is the scene the field of battle shows, Where youth, and age, and bosom friends, and foesâ And broken cannonâcarriages, and steedsâ Divided bayonets,âswords like shatter'd reeds, Lie in confusion, scatter'd here and there, While groans are heard convulsive on the air. The Albions fled, the brave with generous care, From off the field the bleeding warriors bear, Distinction noneâto friend or foe is givenâ The wounds of honour make the valiant even. Back to their tents the patriot ranks return. As heaven's bright jewelry begins to burn. When Riall, gain'd th' expression of his tongue, His chiefs around with sad disaster stungâ To Holland thus,âhis aid: âWith tighten'd rein, Thy charger spur, and leap it o'er the plainâ Hasten to Yorkâsolicit Drummond there, Succour to send our losses to repair. Our foes increase like budding leaves in springâ Or is their strength as David with his sling? Request five thousand to defend the king. Here, on defensive must our arms remain, Till fresh battalions join us on the plain. But why to thee, do I our weakness state, Thou know'st too well our ranks are desolate. âBut stayâWhat gouts are these your robes distain? Some wound is open!âfeel you not the pain? Dismountâsome other must away with speedâ Thou art too feeble to perform the deed. âYou, with the order, Plenderleath, advance, And strive the camp to reach ere morning's glance Tinges the mountainsâ âHolland, thou art pale! Alas, I fear me that thy pulses fail!â He show'd anxiety. Holland replies: âIndeed your questions waken my surprise. True, in the fight I felt a bullet's sting, But nothing worthy of this wondering. I feel my strength and can the officeââ Lo, His utterance fails him! From his knee below, The artery breaking pours a sanguine flow! He trembles with his weakness,âand in swoon Faints like a lily in the sun at noonâ They ease him downâand Plenderleath resumes The vacant saddleâwhile his passion looms To bear the message forthâhe bounds away, As heaven's bright tapers in the arch display Their coral bashfulness, and night's fair queen, In robes of silver on the hills is seen. Swift round its axle winds the spinning earthâ The Sun effulgent gives unclouded birth To infant Morn,âsmiles mantling o'er her face, Divine as nature in her loveliness. Day scarce had chas'd the stars, when Plenderleath York enter'dâfailing was his horse for breath. The drums had beatâtheir place the warriors held, Their armour burnish'dâready for the field; Drummond, he soughtâwho scarce his wrath suppress'd, While to his ear his mission he address'd: âBehold the freeâan overwhelming band, As thick as locust on the Africk land, Or diamond beams, or sands upon the shore, Or stars that sprinkle the creation o'er, Have press'd upon our arms! But Riall stood, And for a time made thin the multitude. It seem'd the more he smote with bayonet thrust, The more they gather'd like thick clouds of dust.â At length exhausted by the carnage wrack, Compell'd he was to wave his standards back. âNow, ere he issues to the field again, You he requests his numbers to sustain.â Earnest he pleads that you'll detach them forth, Brown to subdue from regions of the north.â He spoke with heavy accent. Drummond then: âBrother, Col. Drummond. lead on your noble-breasted menâ Those special legionsâfavourites of the king, Whose triumphs far through utmost Europe ring. Pause not, I urge you, till you end the wayâ Scarce for things needful, your advance delay. âTo George shall I removeâand there remain, Till I shall hear from Riall's arms again. Should I unite him at the present hour With the deep squadrons that compose my power, It might through numbers in a crowded press, Produce confusion to our own distress.â His brother listen'd the command to fillâ Mounted, and led his legions up the hill. With haughty step the musick they repeat, The swift notes whirling with a hurried beat. What time the earth two revolutions made, Revolving silent through night's ebon shadeâ And its fair bosom turning to the sphere, That bends the knee of pagan worshipperâ An emblem of th' Eternal Characterâ The conquering army of the Chippewa, Restedâtheir tumult passions to allay. But as the sun its race began the third, They roseâstood column'dâthis from Brown was heard: âOffspring of Liberty! for two long days, We've quieted our blood. But now fresh bays Invite us to the field. It now remains For us to scour the Lion from the plains. My bosom thanks receive for actions pastâ Till time shall cease, the Chippewa will last! Yet deeds of equal brilliancy appear To light our path to fame's illustrious sphere. Not without energy will valour shineâ A meteor else in darkness to decline! Prepare for arduous toilsâfor sleepless nightsâ 'Tis honourâequal justiceâocean rights, Which binds us to our armsâhence, rise as one, And vict'ry will reward our unison. Yea, England's banner in the dust must yield, When we, cemented, enter on the field. Her proudest veterans bow their stubborn knee, To those in heart determin'd to be free. âNow listen to my purpose: Ripley, move Your bold division to yon waving grove Upon our left extreme:âno flag display, Till you shall reach the flowing Chippewa, One league superior from the British bounds, Where now their thoughts are bent upon their woundsâ There bridge the stream, while Hindman, with his brass, With globes embowell'd, will defend the pass. âThe arch completed, cross in solid rank, And press with rapid movement on their flank, While at the moment I their front assailâ Use spear and falchion, and we proud prevail.â His orders finish'dâPresently withdrew Ripley's battalions with excitement new, To brighten in their fame. The stout pi'neers Down with the wood, where any interferes To pass the cannon o'er the secret road. Brief is the time that finds them at the flood.â Hindman implants upon an eminence His brazen engines ready for defence, Should enemies approach the work to mar, With fire th' imprison'd ruins to unbar. Full soon the patriots by redoubling blow, Cause the tall pines upon the earth to bow; With these they span the stream, and o'er them spread A solid passway for the troops to tread. Drummond by this, had reach'd the Chippewa With ample numbers to sustain the fray. Him, Riall greeted with a smileâand thus His views describ'd with feelings prosperous: âGlad beats my heart t' embrace you at this hour, For thou wilt raise the sinking of my power. The foe incens'd with anger smites with deathâ A furnace kindled by a whirlwind's breath; But now supported by your bands at length, No shield can guard themâthey must bow their strength. When night shall smother out this hateful day, With silent march I'll ford the Chippewa, And wind the path upon their rear unknown, And let the combat at a blow be won. Drummond rejoins âMy sword, to draw in might, Against a foe was ever my delight: Does not the wolf, the leopard, tyger, prey On lambs,âwhen absent is the orb of day? So with myselfâwhen darkness veils the sun, I feel a madness through my veins to run.â While thus they convers'd, lo, a shepherd swain, Of royal bearing, tript it o'er the plain. Tidings his looks express'd. With hurrying breath, To Riall, Drummond, he announc'd their death: âWhy stand conversing this momentous hour? And know ye not, that the Columbian power Is planning a descent! On as I drove My herds to graze the Chippewa above, I kenn'd within the foliage of the woodâ At times in sight, at times in solitude, The starry banner waving in the air, Ready to pass and on your lines to bearâ Yea, as I mark'd them from a rocky ridge, The pines were laid the Chippewa to bridge!â Riall stood fix'dâdisaster in his lookâ At length abrupt his struggling passion broke: âAnd do they thus audaciously aspire? Drummond, be ready to emit the fire! Walbeck, with flying gunsâscarce orders waitâ Attack the arch and sweep it desolate. A veteran cohort to your aid I'll send, That they before thee in the dust may bend, Plant, that your brass when they with flames explode, Shall break their columns as the bridge they crowd.â Walbeck receiv'd in hurry the behestâ He flew with flying cannon, to arrest The farther progress of the patriots' toil.â Arriv'dâhe strives the rising work to spoil;â But Hindman, levelling with guns of fire, Appals his courage while his troops expire.â Walbeck to Riall in disorder flies, A wild expression lurking in his eyes. So when a traveller passing through a vale, Darken'd with jutting rocks, which many a tale Had render'd hideousâhow that walking shades Of recent dead men in the lonesome glades Were often seen to haunt the deep, dark wood, And show their marble bosoms damp with blood! The traveller meets a spirit on his way, All ghastly, muffled in his robes of clayâ He thinks he hears its creeping death-note tread Sound like the step that passes o'er the dead! Alarm'd, he dashes by the hollow wind, Fearing to cast a doubtful look behindâ He rushes to a cottageâbars the door, His heart's blood thickening icy at its core, His up-rais'd hair, quick breath, and pale-shrunk cheeks, Express his horror ere a thought he speaks: Thus Walbeck bore disaster in his lookâ Relax'd by fear his joints like palsy shook. At length, to Riall he: âDefendâguardâsave Thy banner from the dust!âlike ocean's wave They come! They've cross'd!âthey come with numbers strong, Sweeping the plainsâdriving our strength along!â âAnd let them drive along!â Riall rejoins: âLike waves of ocean we'll consume their lines, Or roll them backward as the madded storm Rolls back the ocean in tumultuous formâ Yeaâstrike them into nothingnessâ âBehold! See, on the front the banner'd Stars unfold! Thus, thus assail'd,âwe never can withstand Th' impetuous onset of the charging band! Their steels are bent on slaughter! Forth retreatâ Give back to Queenstown and escape defeat! Behold, they come in violence of wrath,â Their numbers thicken as they beat the path!â Thus Riall, prudent of retreating, spoke, But Drummond gloomy in his darkness broke: âRetreat! No Briton lisp that word aloud!â Let Brownâlet Ripley in deep millions crowd, We'll bear their joints to earth! Riall, no more Think those cold thoughtsâbut hold upon your power, We'll meet, and break the shock!âStand and employ Our arms invincible! We crushâdestroyâ Yea, quench their Stars with blood! Like rocks our men, We'll plant and wall ourselves with bayonets keen. Shame to retreat! The order countermandâ And bid the army flood with fire the land!â While thus their sentiments they held diverse, The Freedom power advanc'd in solid forceâ Ripley, a desert blast the river down, To smite their flankâtheir front, the hero Brown. Behold, Fredonia with a touch unseen, Heighten'd his formâhalf deified his mein, Causing his eye a withering fire to dart, Which like death's arrow pierc'd their every heart! Thus plundering wolves when driven to their cave, Excite their blood the lion's strength to braveâ Each flames the other's rageâthey snap their teeth, And stand determin'd to effect his deathâ But when the potent monarch of the wood Comes storming onward in tempestuous moodâ Lashing his tail against his dark brown sidesâ Loose in the wind his mane disorder'd ridesâ His red eye rolling in a sea of fire, While at each step he swells his passion higher. His opening jaws reveal his foaming tongueâ Earth shakes beneath him as he bounds alongâ The wolves become as water,âin despair They breakâvexing with dying scream the passing air: Not otherwise the legions of the crown, Their works abandon at the sight of Brownâ Like broken waves along the Queenstown road, With consternation in their looks they crowd. The patriots mount the wallsâthe foe retir'dâ A victory gain'd without a life expir'd. Soon as the tumult of the charge was o'er, And each was plac'd according to his power, The venerable Swift saluted Brown, To do some deed to give his years renown: âLo, heaven thus far hath smil'd upon our armsâ But now, the subject that thy breast alarms, Well doth my mind forebode: You strong desire To learn the path on which our foes retire. By your assenting, I a band will guide, And hunt them out, and make you satisfied.â A kind solicitude Brown's answer show'd: âI cannot yield that thou should's trace the road, Holding the enemy. Thy silver brow Is rich excuse for not advancing now. I need thy precept and experience sage,â This arduous duty ill becomes thine age. Riddle I'll order on the Queenstown roadâ I think them there or in its neighbourhood.â To him the aged thus: âNo joy I feel, When foes are present but in works of steel; Then hath the din of arms a musick shrillâ It makes my nerves with young emotions thrill, As when with Green the Eutaw field we wonâ And York, and Monmouth plains, with Washington: What swell'd my breast in those illustrious days, Still round my heart with sweet remembrance plays. When sword to sword our enemies we meet, My pulses quicken with a rising heat. Though that these scatter'd locks are blanch'd with age, Strong is my heart th' oppressors to engage. âAdmit in arms I render up my life, What exit nobler than to ward the knife Aim'd by a tyrant to assail our heart, And break our chain of unity apart. My fall would not be vainâwere I to yield This waning life while battling on the fieldâ These gray hairs, dipp'd in blood, would impulse give To every heart to do the deeds that live! âFew are the hours of my abiding hereâ What signifies a day, a month, a year, To such as me, whom Age doth undermineâ This sword I girded not for mere design; But with the motive Shelby in the west Assum'd his blade, our bondage to arrest.â Brown saw the veteran's energy of mind, Not to be bent from what it cool design'd. âYesâthou art agedâbut thy soul is greatâ Thine ancient heart yet holds its youthful heat. To aid thy enterprise, choose Riddle, Treat. Time suffers not more largely to replyâ For swift and pressing is the emergency.â The aged warrior with young impulse wheel'd, Marshall'd his files and led them o'er the field. The wounded soldier's friend, Treat. his rear pursu'd, Whose nerve elastick never was subdu'd, But like the temper'd steel when forceful bent, Recoil'd with power, augmented by restraint. When Riall lost his momentary fear, A guard he plac'd with Harvey on his rear Brown to observeâbrief were his orders pass'd, Whether encamp'd, or moving slow, or fast. Harvey commanded Willhite from the rank, To scout with caution on the river bankâ And should he mark the Eagle sweep the air, To give th' alarm, and he'd support him there. Willhite from Harvey with his band withdrewâ His soul devoted to the royal viewâ And, on the centre of his heart, a spot Seem'd to declare that he was hell begot. His caution was in vain. The patriots near, By Swift conducted, clos'd upon his rear! The crimes of Willhite sentence him to dieâ And hence he pleads his life imploringly. âSage warrior! spareâO, shelter me with lifeâ Lo, in my blood you'll slay a son and wife! I stand beneath them as a crutch for breadâ They die of famine if you strike me dead! IndulgeâO show me favour for their sakeâ Their tongues will praise thee till their life-cords break, And saint thee when in heavenââ âWhat mean you thus, Pleading for lifeââthe aged tremulous. âWhat fill'd thy bosom with these fears? This sword, To him who yields, protection doth affordâ We to the kneeling warrior mercy show, Hence, cast this paleness backward from thy brow.â This kindness saidâhe wheel'd his charger round, To form his warriors solid on the grouudâ The first rank kneeling, while the next remains Firm to resist the horse upon the plains. To Willhite, now the Fiend with softness came To fill his heart with an infernal flameâ His borrow'd likeness was an aged man,â His beard descending o'er his breast a span. A staff upheld his stepsâslow he drew near, And thus instill'd his poison through his ear: (No eye beheld th' infernal form but his, The better to effect his wickedness.) âWhat, pause you at his life? And art thou man, And yet so blind as not his views to scan? Discard the thought that he intends to save Your lamp of being from the dead, damp grave. As wine of choicest flavour is your bloodâ They'll banquet on your heart as rarest food! Be not deceiv'd by language mild and clearâ The sky without a cloud speaks tempests near. This Swift, bald headed, with a tongue as mild, As though his heart were soft as infant child, Murder'd your father in a peaceful hourâ The time Cornwallis yielded to their powerâ Since which, they've shouted Freedom from our lordâ Th' anointed kingâby monarchies ador'd.â When he shall presently to camp return, Then you, for Raisin's cruelties will burn! âYour death-tube elevate, and stream the fireâ Search his warm life, and safe shall you retire; I'll forth conduct you to a cave at handâ Hence, fear no danger from pursuing band.â On mischief bent, Willhite receiv'd the gun, While rankling murder through his bosom run. Too small his sockets to retain his eyesâ His hair like infant snakes terrifick riseâ Thus hideous, lo, he drew it to his face, Bending his eye the murderous lead to trace. With fatal aim upon the chief it bearsâ He springs the lockâthe flame an instant glaresâ The driven death-shot glance the bony spine, Tearing the muscles that compose the chineâ Through convoluted bowels burst their way, And rush from 'neath the stomach into day! As when a lion at a cooling stream, Shades by a palm tree from the solar beam, A crouching hunter from a thicket near, With reckless arm lets fly a well-aim'd spearâ Hot, hissing from the wound descends the tide Adown the surface of his brindled hideâ The lion rising terrible in mightâ His passions burning to a frenzied height, Leaps in the covert at his secret foeâ Seizes his throat and fangs him at a blow: So aged Swift, when he perceiv'd the wound, Short-wheel'd his charger on th' assassin round, And blaz'd his holster'd arms as back he flewâ Th' avenging lead transfix'd his vitals throughâ Shrieking he perishesâhard cramp'd his eyesâ Blood from his nostril foamsâto hell his spirit flies. During the skirmish, Harvey heard the sound, And urg'd his warriors to the murderous ground. The bleeding veteran marks them through the wood: âWarriors! prepare a sacrifice of blood! Follow my sprinkling gore as on I leadâ And let quick darkness seize them for the deed!â The generous Treat delays with tender word: âFailing of life, O sheath thy lifted sword! Thy blood is wasting! I the charge will guide, Till thou shalt say the deed is satisfiedâ Perhaps not fatal is thy gushing tide!â Swift answers: âNever will I leave the ground, While life remains to wield this falchion round. âGive every arm its nerve! Smiteâslay the power! Let me rejoice in this my dying hour!â His voiceâhis vital drops touch every soulâ Death-striking flames against the foe they roll. The Albions bleeding from the scene retire, Hid in the flashes of the circling fire. Where rage inflam'd the war the veteran stoodâ But heating of his heart more copious pour'd his blood. His features blanch'd, exhausted in the strifeâ Yet lingering at its fountain dwelt his life. His aids dismount, and tenderly assay To bear him backward from the field away, He waves his pallid hand: âHere let me yield My last,âlast slumber on the battle field! This is a death-bed I rejoice to findâ My breath expiresâbut heaven delights my mind!â His tongue was sweet in death. He clos'd his eyeâ A chariot stoop'd from heaven and wing'd his soul on high: Not otherwise an oak with honours crown'd, For rolling years had spread its foliage roundâ When the rude tempest whistled from the north, And snow, and hail in blustering storm drove forth, Beneath its sheltering arms the tender flock Slept in their peace, nor fear'd the howling shock Which thunder'd round its head. The hardy swain, For years had call'd it, pride of all the plainâ While thus renown'dâa wheelwright came by stealth, Beneath the moon's pale beamsâfor sake of wealthâ (O curs'd effects of gold!) and cleft it roundâ It fellâits glories wither'd on the ground! So Swift liv'd honour'd till his latest hour, And fell at length by treachery's murderous power. Treat bears the fallen warrior to the campâ The virtues of the dead the army damp With grief's cold dew. To mark his white locks red, Matted in bloodâtheir cheeks with frost o'erspread! Cold in the grave they sink his pale remainsâ The western sunbeams glimmering on the plainsâ While o'er his breast the broken earth they roll, Brown thus commences to relieve his soul: âDark is the tomb. Here solemn we enshrine The mortal casket of a gem divine. When in the west fair Liberty arose, He drew his brand and sheath'd it in her foes, With Washington, Montgomery, Putnam, Green, And other worthies of that glorious scene. He join'd his country's Star with silver brow, In righteous war for Independence now. He falls lamented in the holy causeâ His name will live while virtue has applause. âThis narrow dwelling-houseâthe deep, damp grave, Receives alike, the coward and the braveâ But markâthe memory of the dastard mind Is wrote in dust and scatter'd to the windâ The valiant lives through lifeâhe never dies While stars shall burn or sun illume the skies! âSuch fame, O Swift! will bright descend to thee,â Till Time shall moulder in Eternity! âHere in thy sleep shall no wild dreams invade To mar thy bosom, 'neath the willow's shade. No more shall Disappointment's barbed sting Transpierce thy heart, and sighs afflictive bring.â Hush'd is the serpent hiss of Slander's tongueâ And Malice enters not the dead among. Pale Envy ceases inward to consume With hell-pent fires, when worth descends the tomb. Yea, thou hast dried in dust Affliction's tearsâ Fled to th' eternal world rich crown'd with harvest years! âPlace two gray stones against his feet and head, To mark the spot where sleeps the warrior dead, That when the traveller shall pass this stream, That he may say: âThere rests an honour'd name!â Yea, future heroes will assemble here, And damp his grave with many a patriot tear!â He ceas'd: For grief weigh'd heavy on his soulâ A frequent tear-drop from his eyelids stole, But he half veil'd the sorrow with his hand, While they fulfill'd in silence his command. They round the grave and sod it o'er with green, And leave with heaven the treasur'd dust within. CANTO XXVIII. BATTLE OF NIAGARA. ARGUMENT. Riall retreats to the Heights of the Niagara .... Brown, having despatched Riddle to spy out the enemy, marches to the left bank of the Chippewa at its junction with the Niagara ... Scott, being sent in pursuit of Riddle, falls in and engages with the whole of Riall's Army .... Riddle, having been extricated from a dangerous situation, joins Scott in height of action .... Night coming on, Riall withdraws his Forces. The scene is laid at the above-mentioned places .... The time is three daysâcommencing on the evening of the burial of General Swift. The meantime Riall rapidly pursu'd The path to Queenstown with his soul subdu'd. As day withdrew from heaven he clomb the Heightâ Niagaraâpavilion'd for the nightâ Near where the Bridgewater its current pours, And the dread Cataract with thunder roars. As Night descended on her sable plumes, And veil'd the earth in unessential glooms, Drummondâthought valiantâyet at heart a fiend. Whose lurid eyes a pestilence portend, Saluted Riall thus: âNo more I feel To wall ourselves at Queenstown. This proud hill Will yield us ample strength. I mark'd the site, While closing day was fading into night. Here we by works defensive can remainâ And in the teeth of all our foes maintain Our flag from falling, should they dare advance Their haughty standards, bent on violence. By morrow's sunâmy mind foretells me thus, My senior brother will unite with us; He bade me notify as late I've said, That he this day would to the Fort proceed.â Amidst their converseâLoring, Drummond's aid, Approach'd with foaming, and this statement made: âWith arrow's speed I've flew from Drummond here, To bear from him this message to your earâ That ere the vanishing of morrow's light, At fort of George his squadrons would uniteâ From thence, o'erwhelming he'd create your force, And scatter Freedom to the Lawrence's source, Where Packenham will meet us with his train, And thus Columbia strangle with a chain.â Thus Riall to the messenger: âWithdraw, And urge the general to the scene of war. We need our utmost now. The foe in fight, Is like the bursting of a storm at night. âHere on this Height my brazen tubes shall I Defend with bulwarks, and assault defy. But scarce so great their frenzy can I deem That they'll advance against the quenchless stream Which we shall pour with sure destruction down, And wrap in bloody shrouds the pride of Brown. âDrummond, proceed and draw the lines at length, And let the walls be solid in their strength. The deep-tongu'd engines plant upon the rightâ By turns, the warriors labour through the night.â Loring by this was bounding o'er the plain, To urge the general to approach the scene. Drummond proceeded with his science band To mark th' embankments to defend the land.â Ere soften'd twilight streak'd the eastern hill, The Heights were bulwark'd with superior skill. And now appears a doubtfulness of dayâ The birds of heaven begin their amorous layâ First twittering on the boughs they tune their throatsâ And clear, and sweeter they advance their notesâ But soon transported,âwith melodious strains, They wake to life the vallies, hills, and plains. As virgin gold is seen upon the skies, The patriot warriors from their tents ariseâ Convok'd in column by the drums' deep roll, Brown in the centre with collected soul Gives to his tongue his thoughts: âOnce more, the day Invites us forth, our standards to display To reach th' immortal prize! The generous Treat Beheld the dust as they the Queenstown beat. âRiddle, your scout with wary footstep lead, And learn where proud the royal tents are spread. âWhen with the breeze you mark their banners play, Then at the junction of the Chippewa Bear me swift notice. Presently shall I Thither remove for the emergencyâ There can the army from the village Schlosser. draw With easy transport means to hold the war. âStrike the pavilions! Rank by tens in file, And let the musick be the quickening style.â Riddle proceeded with his scout to trace, Where wav'd the banner of the Albion race. The warriors struck their tents and fill'd the reinsâ The sturdy horses ready in their chains Onward to move. The musick strikes the marchâ By sections wheeling, in due form they arch In lines of beauty that delight the eyeâ The sunbeams glancing on the musketry. The bayonets pointing up to heaven appear Like petrifactions, form'd of liquid tear That weeps from crystal rocks, as pure, serene, As drops of that bright shower, where first was seen The bow of promise lovely in the skyâ New from the forming hands of Deity. They reach the junction of the flowing streams, As the tir'd sun emits his farewell beams. On a light arch the Chippewa they passâ The flood beneath them a reflecting glass, In which, in proud array their standards shine, Like something pencill'd by a hand divine. They pile their arms to wound and trench the land, Jealous the foe's inbreaking to withstand. Along the Chippewa the lines commenceâ Drops oozing from their brows by toils intense. A day of clouds succeedsâand night returns, Pouring thick darkness from her leaden urns. A dungy vapour from the lake afar, Smothers the brilliancy of every star, Which makes them glimmer in a sickly mood, Though clogg'd in travelling through a path of blood. Lo, in the deepness of the midnight hour, To Riall's tent approach'd the Stygian Power. He seem'd an ancient man for truth rever'd, With eye of thoughtfulness and reverend beard. The hoary counterfeit drew near his bed, And in faint whisper like a dream he said: âChief of proud majesty! impartial hear A voice that pours instruction in your earâ Truth dwells upon my tongueâby years made sageâ Treasure the councils of considerate age: âThe Freedom Star, at close of yesterday, Shone at the junction of the Chippewa. From us their flag is parted by the streamâ I saw them labouring by the twilight gleam. Plac'd are their outward guards eight furlongs hence, Unknown that you defend this eminence. âAnd now, to thee their standards must resign, If thou wilt show an artful discipline: âBrief at the instance of returning day, In line oblique, your every rank display, That each swift lead more sure its death may dealâ This done:âa scout advance to fire and wheel, T' excite them into war,âand then recede, T' allure them here, beneath these Heights to bleed. âMark these my words, and not imprudent deem This midnight vision but a passing dream.â The Fiend thus artful to his fancy spoke, And vanish'd backward in a wreath of smoke. The low-hung vapours settle to the earthâ The dancing stars in beauteous robes shine forth. Proud in their spheres, careering planets roll, While borealis flickers round the pole. The village cock with early clarion shrill, Greets Venus lovely on her chosen hill; Her sisters fadeâbut she, as twilight gleams, More sweetly sparkles in the rippling streams. With simple beauty she bedecks the sky, Till heaven's gold orb illuminates on high. When mimick rainbows in the dew-drops shone, The musick rous'd the legions of the throne. Riall deep weigh'd what he in night had dream'dâ A spy of royalty the vision seem'd. Brief he determin'd when it pass'd his view, The offer'd plan of midnight to pursueâ He thought the whole proceeded from his brain, Dreaming the method of the field to gain. He call'd his chiefsâby sending Plenderleath:â Drummond, and Holbrook, Harvey, Walbeck, Keithâ They at the summons givenâright valorous Approach'dâand Riall his intentions thus: âLeaders, invincible, of England's troop! 'Tis ours this day to make the Eagle stoop To Albion's Lion with his shaggy mane, Whose lightning eye will smite her on the plain. âHarvey, proceed with four times fifty bold, Till you their forward standards shall beholdâ Approachâallure them with a skirmish fight, Till we can reach them with our arms of might. âHolbrook, with Fencibles the batteries hold, Ready their wrath in thunder to unfold. But lock them deep in silence till they show, Ere you emit their volum'd flames below. âDrummond, your falchion draw upon the right, And there the tempest of thy soul excite. Your left, throw backâyour dexter wing, advance, That every ball oblique with death may glance. Walbeck, the left of Drummond is your placeâ Let each his name with royal honours grace.â When Riall finish'd his instructions few, The chiefs immediate to their posts withdrew: Harvey proceeded begin the war, And then alluring to the Height withdraw. Holbrook the cannon guardedâDrummond then, Strong on the right, obliquely play'd his men. Meantime, their wounded the Columbians bore Across the stream with easy-motion'd oar.â And from the village, barges in return, Receiv'd supplies which cause the blood to burn With vitalizing flameâas oil sustains The lamp, or flowers revive from softening rains. Furnish'd with ample means the field to tread, Brown, to the leaders of the army said: âFour dial circles is the sun's descent From heaven's meridian to the occident, Yet, I of Riddle's band have nothing heard, Hence my fears tell me something has occurr'dâ Lost in the wilderness, or perhaps the foe Hath hemm'd him round and he a captive now. âScott, your battalions on the Queenstown lead, And let no object pass in ambush hid. And should you meet the Lion in your way, Send me brief noticeâand commence the fray.â Scott heard the summons with a look serene, And leap'd his chargerâbounded o'er the greenâ Headed his column with a brilliant eye, Bright as their armour in effulgency: As late the Boston Bard from visions roseâ (In night it rain'd, and as it fell it froze,) The forest trees with ice were silver'd o'er, And every shrub a various beauty boreâ But when the sun had topp'd the southeast hill, The scene enchanting made his bosom thrill. Innumerous gems of liquid diamonds bright, Of purest radiance trembled with delightâ He gaz'd with wonder pouring from his eyes, His soul entranc'd with nameless ecstacies. Back from his mind the thoughts of earth were drivenâ It seem'd a fancy-work design'd by heaven: Thus Scott's battalions shone upon the field, Like that which late the poet's eye beheld. When Scott had pass'd the Chippewa, he stay'd His warrior-chiefs,âand these instructions said: âPentland, with infantry in front proceed, And let your name be mark'd with signal deed. Harris, on either wing with icy brands, Your horsemen move to scout the royal bandsâ And, should you meet the standards of the foe, Begin the onset and your bearing show. Forth we, directed by your arms shall wheel And prove the harden'd temper of our steel.â Pentland, and Harris, listen'd to their chief, And in the van their warriors fil'd in briefâ Scott, with slow movement on their rear pursu'd, His prospect cover'd by the hiding wood. Soon Pentland, Harris, open'd on the view Of Harvey's line,âwho, at the sight withdrewâ Pentland hard press'd them with pursuing heat, While back they hied as with unwilling feet. At length, they stood upon advantage ground, And Harvey wheeling, pour'd the battling sound. Pentland, as willing, thus: âThe flames return! But aim the heart before the sparkles burn.â The horse and infantry in line displayâ And each incens'd, maintain an equal fray. The skirmish for a time with spirit burns, Till Harvey, wounded, to his place returns. While Pentland, Harris, this contention held, From Scott their waving standards were conceal'd By intervening wood. Hurrying his path, His eye observ'd them in the midst of wrath. To halt he wav'd his sword. His warriors stand Firm in their place at motion of his hand. âSee Pentland, Harris, glory in the fight! Behold the Albions planted on the Height! They seem like darkness settled on the hill, When trooping ghosts around its borders smile! âThrough scenes of fire, to fame's proud summit climb! There let each name be register'd sublime! Let every heart be cas'd with granite rockâ Yeaâwall it round to meet th' opposing shock. âJessup, your warriors to the right lead forth, And like a reaper, harvest them to earth. And, Leavensworth, the left belongs to thee, Strengthen'd by Towson with artillery. Defend the centre, Brady and MacNiell, And show the binding of your hearts is steel. âBe thoughts of life remoteâno faultering eyeâ Be only thoughtful of the victory! In column follow to the field awayâ I wield my sword a deathless band display, And as you open fire! âWhat though their power Looks like the promise of a thunder shower, Yet will we meet the tempest with a smile, And with a bath of flame melt down the hill.â His voice partook of a celestial sound, For lo, Fredonia bore the echo round! His warriors seem'd translated from the earth, Scorning the sinews of their mortal birth. Scott onward led them with their souls renew'd Beyond the borders of the veiling wood. Riall beheldâto Holbrook, gave the sign, Who bade the matches kindle through the lineâ His cannon pour'd their thunder voice like heaven, When quake the mountains and the hills are riven. Scott plac'd a smile of gladness on his mien, As when a rainbow in a storm is seen: âHark to the organ note! Let each repair, The heart in musick, to his post in war!â The column caught his daring, and display'd, As he the manner of attack had laid, While from the Height a raining fire was hurl'd, As when Gomorrah melted from the world. The meantime Riall pass'd his lines along, And, as he pass'd, this echo'd from his tongue: âRoyals! behold the gathering of the foe! Stand in proud attitude and blood shall flow! It seems that something must have turn'd their brain, Or never thus they'd ventur'd on the plain. Their recent victories will cost them deathâ It makes them reckless of the battle's breathâ See how their standards in the air they loom, But at explosion will their pride deplume; Yea, when our engines shall receive the fire, This haughty port of Freedom will expire. âHark!âHolbrook's enginery begins to burn! But see, they stand and back the flames return! In vain for them upon the Height to bear, And hence, their cannon foolishness declare! Look! they approach:âbut slaughter is their doomâ Sparkle the flint!âconsign them to the tomb!â Lo, as the order from his tongue came forth, A sudden fire seem'd burning on the earthâ Smoke rolling, thunder breaking. Drummond fierce. Look'd though his heart were madden'd with a curse. Columbians stand like spirits on a cloud, While heaven's artillery breaks beneath them loud. Scott turning to his aid in brief beganâ Jonesâsmall of limbâbut mental was the man: âBound to the Chippewa with leaping speedâ And tell to Brown his utmost strength we need. Th' unequal balance of the war you knowâ And how the streams of blood begin to flow.â Jones, without answer, on his courser flew, Swift as an arrow when its race is new. The rapid motion suck'd away his breath, Hence, oft he check'd the rein, of air to breathe; And though in fleetness he outstrips the wind, Yet on his path he lingers in his mind. While these events transpir'd, with winkless eye, Riddle advanc'd the Albion flag to spyâ When soft the sun departed in the west, Close in a thicket grove he sunk to restâ But when at dawn the stars began to fade, He rose âand cautiously the woods survey'd. Now as the sun had turn'd his chariot west, He kenn'd a royal troop in crimson dress'd, Reddening the woods! He whisper'd to his band: âMark you the enemy! In silence stand. Secret we'll pass them in a circle round, And make them cast their weapons on the groundâ From whom the place of their retreat we'll learn, And then to Brown with hasty march return.â His views made manifest,âthey trail the wood, While their hearts beat with stimulating blood. With eyes reverted on the foe they move, Conceal'd beneath the covert of the grove. Soft as they wind an intervening hill, Absorb'd in mind their purpose to fulfil, Three strangers hastening through a glen they spy, Who with concernment in their looks draw nigh. The senior thus to Riddle: âLo, for thee, Our bosoms throb with deep anxiety. We saw thy movement in the forest back, And hasten'd to persuade you to retrack. We grieve at the defeat of Freedom's bloodâ To you this thicket is a dangerous wood. The English cohortsâan o'erwhelming throng, Are trench'd on yonder Heights with bulwarks strong. And these you've late discover'd in the vale, Are but the van to cause your heart to fail. âOur souls are with theeâyeaâwe long to join The Star that beams with Liberty divineâ But O, 'tis more than we can dare to hope, That thou in infancy with age can cope. Their strength comes darkening on!âeach passing day, Ranks crowd on ranks thy powers to disarray. âWhen Hull with treachery to Brock resign'd, Thrice eighty of our brothers were consign'd To death of infamy!âBut I forebode, A phÅnix spirit will avenge their blood! âBy Hull deceiv'd, with weighing caution now, We raise our arm to make our tyrants bow. Our hearts throbb'd lightning when his voice came forth, Inviting us to join with Freedom's birth. In secret places weapons were conceal'd, At his advance to aid him in the field. âThe day is rolling onâthe hour will come, When we shall strike for Liberty at homeâ Each tongue triumphant will her anthems sing, And shout on high deliverance from a kingâ The reign of kings is hastening to decayâ Thy conscript fathers first illum'd the way! Wide o'er the silver lakes the light will spread, Till royal gems shall in its flames be hid, Where thy Montgomery fell, a tomb shall rise, As the first martyr of our Liberties! âBut time admits us to enlarge no more, For seeâthe foe is moving on with power. Now pledging each his faith, our hands we'll joinâ May vict'ry's garland round thy brows entwine!â Riddle with hallow'd feeling gave his handâ Bade them farewell: âYe Patriots of the land! Deep from my heart my holiest thoughts receive, And could I more, I that with joy would give!â This answer said, the strangers bow'dâwithdrewâ And Riddle wheeling to his band in few: âWink at the danger with unclouded eyeâ Follow in silence, and we pass them byâ With hurried footsteps make the Chippewaâ And bear to Brown the tidings of the dayâ Where Riall stands defended on the Height, And how by friendship we were sav'd defeat.â These accents brief pronounc'd, he led them slow, With feet of down to shun the scouting foe. The strangers bade him to the left recedeâ Along the glen with cedars overspread: The streamlet gliding to the Chippewa, From wandering kept him from the path astray. âHark!âStand!â They listen with attentive earâ âWhat sudden vollies on the right we hear? The lines have met! the battle has begun!â âThe message bearing to the chief is done. Th' augmenting peals reverberate aroundâ It seems I feel the shaking of the ground!â The cannon's voiue will guide us to the frayâ Brown must be thereâforsook the Chippewa.â With feet of deer, directed by the sound, They sweep the woods to join the war profound: Thus, when an eagle on a cedar high, To call her young begins the well-known cryâ Shrill as the echoes round the welkin float, Her new-fledg'd offspring listen to the noteâ They spread their pinionsâthrough the air rejoice, Their compass guided by their parent's voice: The band of Riddle, as young eagles thus, Hied through the wood with feelings emulousâ The battle's din was like their parent's cry, Urging their path with impulse rapidly. From the thick covering of the forest, lo, Sudden they pass where large the death-streams flow! So when creation shall dissolve with heat, While thousand whirlwinds on the mountains beatâ And globes of fire with besom vengeance driven, Like comets burning through the waste of heavenâ The sleeping dead upon their pillow'd dust, Shall hear the summons and their chambers burstâ Break from the calmness of the tomb and rise Amid the throes of nature's agoniesâ Yet shall the righteous mark the dreadful scene, And not a fear be cast upon their mein. Not this unlike, from out the solitude, Form'd by an untrod wilderness of woodâ The hero band are usher'd to the field, Where death in even scales the battle held. âForever foremost with the valiant found! While thousands fail, thy name will be renown'd! Advance thy warriors to the left extreme, Whose deeds are worthy of the poet's theme.â Scott spoke their virtueâRiddle, not a word, But as he pass'd he bow'd to him his sword. To far extreme of Leavensworth he strode, And soon the blood in a new channel flow'd. Now the wide field is overspread with fire, While bosoms wounded with a throb expire. From weapons bayonet-pointed ceaseless flash The vaulting flames, while cannon thunders crash, Pausing at intervalsâlike those which break The prisoning clouds, and cause the heavens to shake. Ten chiefs of royal character are laid Prone on the earth, involv'd in death's deep shade: Burk, Fenwick, Cadwell, Huffman, Martin, Dunnâ And Blair, and Baker, Henley, Epherson. Columbians slumber on the beds of death, Their brows encircled with a warrior's wreath. Simral, and Skinner, Hopkinton, and Burnsâ Their memories treasur'd in immortal urns. A lead glancing MacNiell fractures the bone That walls the brainâinsensibleâa stoneâ He drops to earth! His aids dismount and bear Their dying leader to the surgeon's careâ Who raise the skull compressing of the brain, And soon the hero from his trance regain. Now Brady through his hip receives a wound, By which he falls and stains with blood the ground. His soldiers aid him, and he mounts againâ His soul indignant, scorns to leave the pain. Of chiefs depriv'd, the centre ranks withdraw, Unable longer to withstand the warâ But Crawford, Sawyer, in their years of life, With these expressions bind them to the strife: âNeverâO, neverânever thus retireâ But rather bare the bosom and expire! Combine in columnâwe'll conduct you forth To do proud deeds with those of Leavensworth:â As when a flock is scatter'd o'er the plain By ruffian wolves, which half their friends had slain, Two youthful shepherds call them to the foldâ They hear their voices, sweeter than the gold That trembles on the harpâbleating they bound, And herd together at th' inviting sound: So the brave youths unite the scatter'd bands, And lead them forth to where the field demandsâ The left of Leavensworthâtheir powers reviveâ And many a foe the moment ceas'd to live. Now Leavensworth, the pressing strife beheld, And to inflame his warriors on the field, He thus from rank to rank: âLiveâlive, or die! And let this day all other days outvie! Let triple lightnings in their fury glareâ Let thunders burst and break along the airâ Let whirlwinds sweep the earthâlet nature reelâ Yea, let the gripe of death creation feelâ Never shrink backwardânever wink an eyeâ We gain the fight, or gain eternity! His soul came forth. Hot plays the chasing bloodâ To heaven they kindle like a blazing wood. As night descends, more dread the fiery stream Touches the features with a ghastly gleam, Like spectres riding on the clouds of fire, Seen as the flashes quicken and expire. Scott on the summit of a hill had stood To mark the field. He gives command to Wood, Ever at hand: âTo Leavensworth declare, That he advance against the right wing there, And break it back. No longer thus contend With doubtful lead, but on the steel depend!â Wood plied the spur and bounded to the chief,â And spoke the mandate with an accent brief: âI bear the word as Scott te me hath saidâ The wing charge back, nor trust th' uncertain lead.â âWarrior, return and to the chieftain say, I'll strive the desperate order to obey. Though half my strength is melting in the dust, I'll lead the onsetâdie in arms the first! âHush, hush the fire! We now our souls must prove, Firm through the dreadful walks of death to move! Sole on the sharpen'd steel our hopes relyâ On like a desert blast and rush the enemy!â Ere he had ended was the fire suppress'dâ Each held his arms supported on his breast. They move against the field with angry bladeâ And as they move they cast a dubious shade, Deep like the darkness that precedes a storm, Threatening the earth with ruin to deform. Meantime with loosen'd rein the gallant Wood To Scott return'd: âThe field is drunk with blood! Though half his strength is weltering in the fray, The daring chief is moving on his way!â âHis loss is more severeâ âFly, and return, And bid the hero let the battle burnâ Skim the red earthâthe order countermandâ Rescue from death the fame-eternal band!â Wood leaps an arrow in its burning glance, And thus to Leavensworth in proud advance; âThe general bids thee to implant thy bandsâ Repeat the fireâThe order countermands!â Th' obeying warrior halted at the word, And a full volley on their centre pour'd. The moment's pause admitted them to breathe, Hence, to the foe they larger flame bequeath. So when on melting coals is fuel thrown, It cools the ardour of their burning downâ But the combustibles ere long revive (Kindling intense beneath) the flames and liveâ The momentary cause that damp'd the fire, Adds to the blaze intensity of ire: Such the effectâthe pausing of the free, Pour'd deeper vollies on the enemy. The meantime Drummond foaming, in his might, Became like frenzy to maintain the fightâ Along the field he cast a blackening look, And thus enrag'd his failing host bespoke: âWhat, shall we kneel our joints upon the earth To those, who know no royalty of birth? Who wear no gilded star upon their breast, To show a Monarch has their actions grac'd! Shall such as these our banners overcome? For shameâye English!âplunge them to the tomb! Did I you English call?âthe name you've lostâ Your hearts are frozen with a coward frost. What, conquer will ye not, with thousands strong, A race of yesterdayâin battle young? âYe are not men! The field of thunder fly! Go to the loomâthe female distaff plyâ Enrobe your women in the works of steel, For they more valiant will your deeds excel! âBritons! prove worthy of your namesâreviveâ Never like dastards from the battle give! Let flames be seen as hellâyea, fierce as deathâ Rise, rush, smite, smother them with burning breath, And let their bodies bleach upon the heath;â Uncase the hidden heart! slaughter make good, And let my soul be satisfied with blood!â Impassion'd with his hell he raving said, While his swell'd eyeballs started from his head. His legions roseâimpetuous, a stream Bursting its banks. With violence of flame, Tinging the edges of the clouds of heaven,â So vast a torrent of mad fire is driven, Intent to sweep the Patriots from the fieldâ Yet still unshaken they the combat held! Thus Ãtna blazing equal for a time, Waxing nor wanning in its power sublime, Till that a spark found passage through a rock, Which long had sav'd the mountain from a shock,â Deep sunk beneath were bods of nitre stow'dâ Sulphur and iron ready to explodeâ The sparkle animates the fiery massâ The mountain thunders from the place it was: The flames ascending to the height of heaven, Palsy the earth with dire convulsions riven. So had the Albions with unyielding pride, Pour'd the red liquid in a flooding tide, But Drummond's voice was as the quickening spark, Maddening their blood to strike the fatal mark. Like rock-hewn images the Patriots stand, Defying death at Leavensworth's command. Buried in flames they back return the lead, And many a foe is number'd with the dead. But Drummond still advancing with a pressâ Thus Leavensworth to Wood in sore distress: âTo Scott reboundâand him O brief inform, How wastes my strength! how direful is the storm! I fear that we must give! It wrings my heart To think the thoughtâBut see what lives depart!â A hasty meteor streaming down the skies, Wood to the general without breathing flies: âSo dire the smothering flames our arms scarce liveâ And Leavensworth forebodes that he must give!â Scott drank the icy wordâhis goading heel Plied to the tender fibreâbar'd his steel, While flying with the fury of the wind, The time it leaves the hurried clouds behind. His presence like divinity of soul, Thrill'd every bosom and inspir'd the whole! âGive fire to the heart! O 'tis sweet to die!â Who dies this day will reach eternity! Lo, Brown approaches with a veteran bandâ Here will I pour my blood upon the land! Die, die with me, and glorify the sceneâ Forget your birth was that of mortal men!â Instant he clos'd, behold he flash'd his brand, Which seem'd as fire that kindled in his hand. The warriors felt his influence not of earth, And pour'd to heaven their adorations forth. The air is thick as dropping rain, with ballâ Both friend and enemy unsightly fall. The vaulting flames whole ranks successive kill, While streams of blood run smoking down the hill. As when a storm comes scowling o'er the earth, Mustering its anger as it passes forth; Slow it proceeds on murky wings along, An awful silence muffled on its tongue. At length, it pours its ruins on the height Of Laurel Ridgeâthe mountain braves its mightâ The balls of thunder break upon the rocks, While fiery fragments fasten on the oaks, And kindle them sublime,âmad whirlwinds swellâ Yet fix'd, the mountain stands immoveable: The Patriots thus th' unequal strife maintain, Though death comes forward in a fiery rain, Scathing the earthâdread thunders roll on high, Whilst whirling clouds are toss'd through vacancy. The soul of Riall shrunk to mark the slainâ And thus to Plenderleath,âhis heart in pain: âTo Drummond hasten in the midst of war, And bid him column'd from the strife withdraw. The foe his ranks with numbers must have swell'dâ 'Tis waste of life!âCommand him from the field.â Rapid the mandate Plenderleath convey'dâ The summons wrathful Drummond sour obey'd, Backward he led his army from the scene, O'er horse and rider slain,âand dead, and dying men. As slow he mov'd so hush'd the work of death, For Scott's immortal band were failing of their breath. How awful is the pause! The war's red light, Glaring the elements is roll'd in night. Strange silence reigns, save dread Niagara's sound, Which heavy roars with solemn din profound. The bosom-breaking groans of dying men At times upon the gale are heard between. Ghosts flit in darkness deep, all rob'd in white, Travelling with paleness o'er the field of fight. CANTO XXIX. BATTLE OF NIAGARA CONTINUED. ARGUMENT. Scott is reinforced by Brown,âRiall by General Drummond .... The Battle is renewed with great violence .... Jessup attacks the British Reserve .... Capture of General Riall .... Ripley and Miller assail and carry the Heights. The scene is laid at the mouth of the Chippewa, and at the Heights of the Niagara .... The time is about six hoursâcommencing with the beginning of the Action. When clos'd the armies in contention dire, Their blood-veins burning as though streams of fire, The peals redoubling from the cannon's tongue, Wide through the elements convulsive rung, Mix'd with a flame like that to lightning given, When thunders shake the firmament of heaven. Brown at the Chippewa, listening profound, Soon heard the war reverberate aroundâ And judg'd that Riall with unbroken power, Was near the Heights of the Niagara shore. His features brighten'd as the action grewâ And thus to Ripley, he began in few: â'Tis Scott!âI know his cannon by their tongueâ Hasten thy warriors in their strength along. From Heights Niagara the tumult breaksâ How the strife thickens!âhow the concave shakes! I with my flying aids will onward bound, For Scott, perchance, may meet a fatal wound.â This said, he waited not,âbut touch'd the goadâ His mettled courser dash'd upon the roadâ Dix, Austin, and MacRee, and Spencer young, With equal speed devour'd the path along. Who meets and stays the chief?âthe aid of Scottâ Jonesâwhom he sent, when first the war grew hot. âExpress I left the field. The battle now Pours on our ranks a torrent overflow. On Heights Niagara oblique they stand, And like a furnace conflagrate the land.â Jones spoke with rapidness. Quick-thoughted Brown, Him answer'd brief: âTo Chippewa glance onâ Bid Porter to advance ere night grows dark, And Hindman, ready with his flying park.â He stay'd to add no moreâbut onward flew, And reach'd the field as Drummond's strength withdrewâ Jones to the Chippewa his charger press'd, And gave to Porter's ear the chief's behest. When Brown approaching was by Scott beheld, A gladdening musick every fibre thrill'd: Thus when a vessel by a tempest shock, Is dash'd in fragments on a pointed rock, The mariners apply the means at hand, To ride the billows to the distant land. Numbers in panick seize upon an oar, And never with their life are heard of more. The mate, with every effort in his reach, Lash'd to a spar, gains slowly on the beachâ At length, exhausted, struggling with the flood, He feels death's palsy stiffening up his blood, Lo, in the act of yielding to his fateâ Vanish'd his every hope, disconsolateâ His captain hastens with the boat-of-life, And swift redeems him from the billowy strife! O'erpower'd with feeling, long his tongue denies To give expression to his ecstacies: Such feelings came to Scott, when he beheld The chief advancing through the glimmering field. âMy soul was sinking in the dust of earthâ But O, thy presence gives my hope new birth! I need not history the battle now,â By the deep groans you may the sadness know. The field was cloth'd with fire! Full half my strength Are shrouded cold in bloody robes their length. Burns, Simnal, Skinner, Hopkinton, are made Like wither'd lilies, on their biers low laid. Others their blood like water on the earth, In rich abundance for the cause pour'd forth. The wounds of Brady ask for time to healâ With skull in fractures is the bold MacNiell. Fain would my tongue of Leavensworth recite, And Jessup's deedsâfame covers them as light. Of Crawford, Sawyer, silence would be crimeâ For youths so young, their efforts were sublime; The centre column, by its leaders slain, Was broke in fragments, scatter'd o'er the plainâ But lo, like shepherds when the wolves are near, They brought them back,âdissolv'd their every fear. âThe half I cannot noteâWho can relate Distinctive characters, where all are great?â He ended. Brady with a flush rejoins: âToo shallow is my wound to leave the lines. So long as I retain my bosom's heat, From off the field I never will retreat.â His eye convey'd his meaning by its look, And Brown his thoughts of admiration broke: âMy tongue deceives me:âLo, I thought to speak The language of my heartâbut O, how weak! Yes, I a something in my bosom feelâ But I that something never can reveal. My tongue limps awkward to express my soul,â Feelings I feel, beyond me to control.â âRound every temple will the laurel bloom, Celestial plants will flourish on their tomb. None can have eminenceâallâall are firstâ Those pass'd with life are wrapp'd in envious dust! E'en could I speak their fame, th' important hour Forbids their eulogy. The royal power By the deep echo of their drums afar, In strength are gathering to provoke the war. âSpencer, away upon the wing of flight, And bear these orders through the shades of night: âPorter, whose mind is steel combin'd with gold, On left of Scott, will his position hold! And Hindman, Towson, will the centre takeâ Their guns' explosion will the silence break. On right of Scott will Miller, Ripley, form, And mark with jealousy the rising stormâ For should the foe on Scott, or Porter bear, Intent to crush their lofty character, They in deep column will the Height assail, And pierce the engines of their life with steel.â Spencer impatiently receiv'd the wordâ Wheel'dâand his charger to the office spurr'd. While these preparatory plans were laid, Ripley his cohorts on the path had stay'd. Soon Porter join'd him with his volunteers, To shine like stars that decorate the spheresâ Ritchie, and Hindman,ânames to never die, Drew in the centre their artillery. Now Ripley turning to his ready aidâ The swift MacDonald,âthis commission said: âOutleap the wind, and seek the ear of Brownâ Inform the chief we wait for our renown.â MacDonald rein'd his courser and retir'd, Sweeping his way with lightning sparkle fir'd. In half the distance he young Spencer meets, Who him with friendly salutation greets: âWhither away so fast? Is Ripley on? I bear to him the purposes of Brown.â âHe is,ââ(replied MacDonaldâaccent brief,) âThis saves my farther progress to the chief. Repeat what part is oursâno time to stayâ Time flies on lightning wings. The orders say!â âSilent receive them: On the left of Scott, Porter will marshall to elance the shot. With Towson, Hindman will his park unite, And take the centre and begin the fight. Ripley will stand upon the right extreme, Ready to answer when the guns shall flameâ And jealous watch, as circumstance shall call To drive the bayonet, or let fly the ball. âThese the instructions to the Ripley lineâ Brother, farewell,âthat's yours, this course is mine.â Nodding in compliment they wheel'd awayâ Spencer to Brownâwhere Ripley's troops array With Porter's, Hindman'sâback MacDonald sped, And gave what Spencer on the path had said. The different chiefs, when they the summous heard, Took their positions without passing word. Meanwhile, from fort of George, Drummond his arms Led forth in squadrons like successive swarms. Vincent, with strength reserv'd, remain'd behind, The host to succour with victorious mind. As Drummond rose the hill with royal band, Riall approach'd and offer'd him his hand. âA new sensation in my breast I feel, To greet you here, clad in the works of steel! Never such strife was seen since earth beganâ At first I doubted that their strength was man. Nothing my mind can liken to this even, Save Michael's battle on the plains of heaven. The more we slew, more strong they seem'd to rise, While dire the conflict kindled to the skies. Your brother fought them with a lion's wrathâ His smiting falchion carv'd a slaughtering path. âBut sad my bosom heaves to speak the truthâ Shaw, Amherst, Aimwell,âBarrington the youth, Yielded their livesâand Darnely, Hoffman, Stoneâ Buckhamstead, Odin, Epherson, Mahone. âSo numerous were the slain, at edge of night, I thought it prudent to withdraw the fightâ And Loring speaking your approach at hand, Made me more ready to recede the land, That we together might a plan devise, To strike their towering standards from the skies. But I must warn you of the fiery Scottâ Steel-ribb'd his heart, impervious to the shot.â Thus he. And Drummond then: âThe thought was wise To drain the blood of all our enemies! My bosom long hath panted for this hour, To wrench the Eagle from her rock-cliff tower. Speak not of Michael in the fight of heaven, For lo, they presently to death are given. Yeaâbrief the number'd minutes which they liveâ And scarce I mercy to their prayers will give. âThis Brown once conquer'd, and his forces dead, We'll cross the lakesâtheir shores triumphant treadâ Ransack the villagesâtheir dwellings burn, And all the country into ruin turn. âRiall, in rest, stand you upon reserveâ Your deeds this day the royal gifts deserve, For thou hast fought them with superior nerve. Now I invincible will onward rush, And at a blow these Michael warriors crushâ Yeaâthis day's scene shall never be forgotâ But first, I'll sacrifice the blood of Scott. âBehold, their cannon lightens up the hill! On, England! onâand show your power to kill!â As when from bleak November's squally cloud, The winds with violence come rushing loud, Levelling the stately forest in its pathâ Shaking the hills like earthquake in its wrath: The arms of Drummond raise an equal sound, Moving to battle o'er the solid ground. Loud groans the earth beneath their labouring feetâ Sudden they open with a dreadful sheet, Broad as the blazing of an ocean fire, When clouds emit their thunderbolts of ire! Like Egypt's pyramids the Patriots stand, Strong in their strengthâunconquerable band! Porter inflames the breast of volunteersâ The noise of Scott breaks deafening on the spheresâ The brass of Albion quicken into flameâ Hindman, and Towson, light the field the same. Ripley, and Miller, consecrate the rightâ No mortal tongue the tumult can recite. O Muse! sustain me but for one brief hourâ Give to my thoughts the strength of Homer's powerâ My nerves convulsive start beyond controlâ Through my pent heart the blood-streams cease to roll. My breast heaves agoniz'd. Mine eye is set Firm in my headâI'm bath'd in gory sweat. My mind illumine with ethereal light, To paint the horrors of this dreadful night! As when two comets with an aspect drear, Roll to engagement through the hemisphere, Each at the other with destruction driven, While flames augmenting, singe the cope of heaven; Behold, they strike! ten thousand lightnings flyâ Ten thousand thunders burst along the skyâ With fear the planets start!âThe earth and sun, Loosen'dâfrom sphere to sphere delirious run. Creation's axle trembles with the jarâ Ten thousand spirits shriek upon the air. Stars melt away before the blinding sightâ Chaos returns on wings of smothering night: The strife not this unlike. Ghosts crowd the fieldâ The warriors stand, as though on heaven they held! Brown looks like something spiritual in form, As on from rank to rank he swells the storm, Wielding his blade of fireâkindling the whole, To pour the blast in violence of soul: âEternity is thine! Death's agent band! Firm on the centre of your glory standâ Stand like the monuments of ancient time, Surpass the proudest of their deed sublime. Loosen your souls and magnify the sceneâ Be more like deities than breathing men!â A spirit's voice could nothing more inflame, Touching the heart!âthey rise beyond their fame. Like fire devouring through a grove they move, Or frenzied meteors scorching heaven above! So vast the strife it humbled Drummond's pride, And to his aid with hurried breath he cried: âTo Riall cleave the way with swallow's speedâ A thousand Britons in the slaughter bleed! Command him instant with reserve to down, Or we may fail to seize upon his Brown.â Loring nods his plumeâand, reining in his horse, Plies a sharp goadâhe burns upon his courseâ Like wind leaps up the hillâhis charger's feet Scarce touch the ground, they dart away so fleet. Now when the battle in its rage began, Jessup, who oft in danger led the van, Conceal'd in darkness, with his warriors stood, Close on the borders of a hiding wood, In which reserv'd were Riall and his train, Ready at signal, Drummond to sustain. The path that reach'd them, Jessup, with a an eye Brightening in fire to seize the enemy, Searches impatient to assail their rear, And crop a laurel in the midnight drear: So when at dusk, a shepherd pens his flocks Beneath a ledge of Alleghany's rocksâ But through his hurry in a storm of hail, Forgets to fasten the superior railâ Behold, a panther comes in hungry hour, To seek an entrance and the flock devour. He compasses the fold, then backward wheels, And jealous every part successive feelsâ And not unfrequent shakes the loosen'd bar, That soon must fall and give them to despair: Thus Jessup seeks the passage of the wood, To gain the foe, where Riall waiting stoodâ Frequent the path he traverses in haste, Unknownâso thick the darkness of the waste. At length confirm'd, he strikes upon the road, Which streams a tide of pleasure through his blood: As when an anxious traveller, faint with toil, After long absence from his native soil, Gains in close distance, at the hour of night, His home-sought village, glowing with delight, Giddy with joy, he wanders from the road, That would have led him to his sweet abodeâ Heedless he travels till he gains a brake, Where soon the strangeness opens the mistake,â He stands, he pondersâtraces back the path, Now press'd with griefâand now half vex'd with wrath. His tumult passions lead him more astrayâ He turns his back upon the village way. At length, his feelings calm'd, he views the star, That shines unchangeable in heaven, afar, And learns the compass where his heart is plac'dâ He wheels his courseâLo, thirty footsteps pac'd, He strikes upon a trace, where, when a boy, He oft had sported in his pastime joy! The weariness at once forsakes his limbsâ His soul delicious in a transport swims: So Jessup, when he found the secret course, That wound upon the rear of Riall's force, Felt his soul swimming in a blissful sea, Like the spent trav'ller in his ecstacy. He publishes his purpose: âHearts, unite, And immortality rewards the night! Behold, the enemy engag'd severe, Hath left this passage to our progress clear,â Which, cautious trac'd, will lead to his reserve, Where ye can prove the iron of your nerve. The battle on the left absorbs his mindâ He little dreams of dangers from behind. While Scott exalts his character with Brown, Shall we not strive to match them in renown?â His warriors felt their pride. Life's currents flow Rapid through every breast to strike the blow. They feel their way with muffled footstep round, Veil'd in the deepness of the night profound. At length, they stand in column on the rearâ And Jessup's voice again demands their ear: âSuccess thus far, our purposes hath crown'dâ Soon shall their hot blood curdle on the ground. Ketchum, with stillness to the left incline, While I direct proceed against their line. Should you discover guards,âdetachments outâ You'll thenâbut why direct you in the scout? See the hard flint be loos'd from every gunâ We'll place success upon the steel alone. âTo him who yields, a kind protection giveâ The captive soldier, generous let him live. More rich, more verdant to the victor hand, The laurel blooms, when twin'd with Mercy's hand! âBe firmâbe resoluteâwith footstep slowâ Still as Ohio's wave,âdeep plunge the blow!â Like spirits walking o'er their graves, they move, While a damp silence settles from above. No breathing organ stirsâbent on the strife, It seems the pausing of the wheels of life. They gain their distance cover'd by the wood, And plunge their bayonetsâsoak the earth with blood. The foe confounded, not a weapon wieldsâ And one detachment on another yields.â Those in their daring who resistance show, Receive their deaths at one decisive blow. Although his captives far his strength exceed, Th' immortal Jessup suffers none to bleed: The laws of battle would have crush'd their life In the wild moment of the midnight strifeâ But mercy tempers the Columbian's heart To spare the vanquish'd from the lifted dart. But Jessup!âwhere, O where is Raisin's shore? The fall of Pike? Miami's stream of gore?â I will not wake thy memory severeâ I mark thine eye to glisten with a tear. Yeaâfar more verdant to the victor band, The laurel blooms, when twin'd with mercy's hand. While Jessup thus.âKetchum with down-soft tread, Feels his dark way to do some signal deed. He standsâhe listens to a swift-horse trampâ 'Tis Loring dashing to the Riall camp.â âHalt in your place! Hark! that echoing sound! Lo, it may lead where Riall may be found! Listen! lie closeâhe came upon this course!â I mark his shadowâsee!âhath rein'd his horse. He bears important message I presume From yonder army fighting in the gloomâ âBe up!âariseâin breathless silence standâ Whoe'er they be, behold them at our hand! Feel on my rearâand soon their grade we'll knowâ Perhaps an aid and general of the foe.â Soft at the word his anxious band proceed With soundless footstep to perform the deed. The spot where Riall stood, unknown they reach, As Loring thus commenc'd his hurrying speech: âRiall!âa host of Britons on the plain, Pour out their bloodâa thousand are the slain! Drummond commands that youââ âNo! I command!â Ketchum replies, supported by his bandâ âDismount, whatever be your gradeâand know, I speak not twice!âI am thy country's foe!â As when two stately bullocks chew their cud, And sweet, a second time enjoy their foodâ With ears turn'd back, they press the rich repastâ The fattening juices melting on their tasteâ While thus secure in reckless thought they standâ Behold, conceal'd in night, a shaggy band Of hungry wolves approach with watery jaws, Burning to stuff them in their empty mawsâ The bullocks bellow distressâtossing high Their horn-clad heads without the power to fly. Not otherwise the heart of Loring shook, And Riall's, when the voice of Ketchum broke. But soon as utterance to the general came: âOur swords are thine; and Riall is my name. 'Twas not by my command that Swift was slainâ His murderous death my bosom touch'd with pain.â âAnd dost thou mention Swift to wound mine ear? His bleeding exit starts a bitter tear! Murder thrice horrid! Guilt will haunt the mind, And make it shudder at the passing windâ Yeaâe'en the musick of the Zephyr's breath, Will start the soul with freezing sounds of death. âAway, thy cloudy fears: Columbians brave Never a crime committed with the grave. We treat our enemy with mercy blandâ No gout of murder stains a freeborn hand. Vengeance we leave to Him, who nations madeâ To him who yields, protection is our blade. âBut, Riall! we respect thy valiant nameâ Not with dark blood hast thou bedimm'd thy frame. Though in the battle we had cause to fear The anger of thy brand, a fire severe, Yet, we regard the warrior in the strifeâ He only has our hate who sports with life. âNow to find Jessup will employ our care, To add our strength, and do the things we dare.â They move quick-passing at the rapid word, To join their chief and exercise the sword. The meantime Jessup conquers as he goesâ His rushing steel disanimates his foes. Their general lost, makes worse confusion stillâ The whole reserve fall broken down the hill! The numerous captives in the care of Crane, Are back conducted from the field of slain. This daring feat achiev'd, Jessup exclaims: âHard screw the flintsâprepare to light the flames. Warriors, behold upon the Queenstown path, A sheet of fire consumes our Scott in wrath! Well do I know him by his portly height, And by his manner to inflame the fight. With smother'd voice we'll move upon their rear, And strike the flint-fire to the heart severe.â His plan made manifest,âhe leads them on By the red glare that from the battle shone, Glancing like lightning in a dark, bleak night, Guiding the traveller by the doubtful light. And now in dark, and now in light, they hie, While the quick flashes burn upon their eye. Slow, cautious, silent, o'er the dead they feel To gain a wall's deep shadeâand there conceal. Distantâten footsteps opposite the road, The Harvey line successive blaze and load. Between the openings of the loose-laid wall, The Patriots aim to consecrate each ballâ Each eye bent levelâready to expire At Jessup's word: He gives it: âTouch the fire!â Chill from behind the Albions hear the soundâ (Save those convuls'd in blood upon the ground.) They stand in their surpriseâand nothing know, So great their dreadâfrom whence proceeds the blow. As when abrupt the northern winds arise From out their magazine in polar skiesâ Down the bleak mountain tops they sweep their wayâ From thence they dash to madden up the sea. This way, and that, the ocean foams awhileâ Waves dash on wavesâthey chafe, they roar, they boil. At length, the wild winds in their fury strong, Drive the craz'd billows through the waste along. In like distress the British legions stood, Till thought returning, drove them to the wood. Brown at a distance saw the brilliant deed, And by the blaze impetuous rush'd his steed. He comesâhis voice is heard: âWhat daring chief Disbands the enemy?â The hero brief: âJessup am Iâthe right of Scott's brigade; And does he live?â âHe does. Never shall fade Thy mem'ry from the earth. In vain to tell The pride I feelâyou every fame excel. This deed of thine from death hath rescu'd Scottâ Thy name with his will never be forgot. âNow you'll return and form on Ripley's right, Whose name like thine is terrible fight.â In act to rein his steed, loâKetchum came, Equal in honour with the best of fameâ Riall and Drummond's aid their side arms held, A grace the victor granted on the field. Soon as they fix'd on Riall with their eyes, The band of Jessup shouted to the skies: âLive, Jessup! liveâthy country's pride and boast! Live, Ketchum! liveâand live thy valiant host! This night we triumph in the field, or die! When Brown commands, the Eagle sweeps the sky, And with her arrows slays the enemy!â Riall and Loring to the rear convey'd, Jessup seeks RipleyâBrown's command obey'd. What time these darings on the rear transpir'd, Opposing armies with ambition fir'd Labour'd in arms. Fierce Drummond from the Height, With rage impetuous pour'd the desperate fight. Scott, Ripley, Porter, Hindman, Towson, Brown, Withstood the battleâfix'd in their renown. Blood follow'd every peal. But Drummond still, Unceasing hurl'd red ruin from the hill: So once when Hecla pour'd its fires to heaven, By which, earth's confines from its depths were rivenâ The spectres rous'd, which habited the land, To press the flames convok'd their ghostly bandâ The mountain bent its pointed fires around, To drive the untomb'd spirits from the groundâ But they a whirlwind loosen'd from beneath, And urg'd it on with ruin's smothering breath.â The fiery whirlwind and the burning height, (So legends tell,) impetuous clos'd in fight. Hell felt the shock, deep from its centre rivenâ The stars shrunk back or melted in mid heaven. Thus Albion pour'd the battle o'er the land, And thus like spirits the Columbian band, Return'd it backward with destruction fierce, Whilst fiery whirlwinds wrapp'd the universe. Ripley at length conceiv'd a fearful planâ And rode to Miller and abrupt began: âWe toil without effect. The Albions still, Roll down a burning slaughter from the hill! No hope is mine, that we can long maintain The fightâby thus contending on the plain. I'll storm the Height. How do your pulses move? Thy soul braves deathâdo you the plan approve?â âI'll try sir,â were the words that Miller said, So well the warrior scann'd the peril dread. âI knew a heart of steel thy bosom hadâ And be it thine to charge their thunders mad. With me, MacFarland, Brook, will strike their flankâ Rushing with bayonet break upon their rank. You at the pivot moment rise the browâ Be but resolv'd, the Height we'll overthrow.â This said, the chieftain in his ardour went To nerve the warriors for the dire event. MacFarland, Miller, Brook, their bands unite, And wait the signal to assail the Height. Ripley, in centre with elated soul, Breathes patriot fire which kindles through the whole: âNow prove that Liberty new fashions menâ And show the world a never-acted scene! Behold, the blazing of yon Heights above! There, like the threeâGod's worshippers we move! It seems remote, a desperation dire, To storm the battlements o'erwhelm'd with fireâ But know,âat our approach 'twill forth subsideâ We'll quench it with their blood in copious tide! The scenes of danger are made large by fearâ But lo, they vanish as we press them near. Sayâthat we fall!âman but exists to dieâ How sweet is death to bleed for Liberty! âAre not our days all number'd in the mind Of Him, unseen, who rides upon the wind? Hence, man should never pause where duty leadsâ In face of death to do immortal deeds. But why these words?âyour secret souls I knowâ Your hearts ask nothing but to meet the foe. âStar-brightening honours on the action waitâ In years to come, each actor will relate The wonders of this night! When ye are gray, And all your strength Herculian shrunk away, Your children's children with a ravish'd ear, Will learn your historyâdropping many a tear Pure from the heartârejoicing in your worthâ Their tongues will bear your praises through the earth! âAway!âtoo long have I detain'd you nowâ Advance in solid form, and die, or smite the foe!â Like clouds of midnight at the word they move, While showering flames pour flooding from above! Yet like the spirits walking on the blast, They rise unbroken to the conflict vast! Soon by the nitrous glare, the wonderous men By Drummond on the Heights were dimly seen, Like spectre shades behind the darken'd moon, Labouring in eclipse at midnight noonâ And now they vanishânow again in crowds, Lurid they show themselves like folding clouds: Thus Drummond, doubtful, through the fire and smoke Beheld the columns,âand thus dubious spoke: âWhat forms are these dim-moving on the sight? The wandering spirits round the hill of fight! Not mortal can they beânot men would dare Against this burning of the Height to bear. âMortals are they!âdistinct do I perceive Their gleaming arms, by which I know they live! âWaveâwave your Eagles!âlet no fears be knownâ Comeâand receive the greetings of the Throne! âThey come at my invite! they come, indeedâ They pourâthey rush along with burning speed! Not mortal is their life! They live in fire! Let larger volumes on their ranks expire! Breakâsunder the hill! centre-strike their soulâ Outnoise the thunderâconflagrate the whole!â Thus Drummond, passionate, commanding spoke, A frenzied wildness staring from his look. Ten thousand battle arms augment their flame Against the columns of immortal name. A tier of engines from their brazen jaws, Tremble the heavens to stay the Freedom cause. On fiery wings a ball with deadly force, Glanc'd at MacFarland urging on his horseâ Pierc'd his arch'd temples as he turn'd his head His troops to animate: Convulsive, deadâ He drops to earth!âAs some tall pine renown'd, Stands on its hill with verdant honours crown'dâ A wild tornado dashing on amain, Uproots and hurls its glories on the plain. It groans, it shivers, as it strikes the groundâ The solid earth repeats the dying sound. The warrior thus with icy shivering diesâ Like the tree blasted, on the field he lies. His fire-smote column faulters in their might, Struck pale with horrour at the flaming Height! But Ripley, bounding with a meteorous eye His soul makes manifest: âOn steel rely! Stand in your place! Avenge your leader's fall! Never give backward from these flickering ballâ I see no danger here! Be not as menâ But strike like spirits with the bayonet keen!â They bind in phalanx by the hero stay'd. And rise the summit with th' unsparing blade. The meantime Miller and his warriors stern, Proceed in front where all their thunders burn. With nerve unshaken to the scene they rise, Something not mortal glancing from their eyes! Lo, in ten footsteps of the cannon dread, He gives the order: âPlunge them with the dead!â The desperate mandate pass'dâthe Patriots bound Mad on their enemy! Blood foams around! Steel mixes with steelâfalchions falchions clashâ Man grasps with manâdown on the earth they dash, Each headlong mangled. Fine beneath their tread, The rocks are dust. Life finds a bloody bed. Niagara's cataract,âthough struck with awe, Is hush'dâso vastâso terrible the war. Brains spatter the fieldâbosoms stream afresh, While carnage piles the hill with mounds of quivering flesh. The Albions reeling fall on every handâ Pool, Hicks, and Anderson, Field, Ashton, Blandâ Gill, Ingram, Hopkins, Rivers, Paulding, Waitâ Dagallon, Copeland, Stockwell, Applegate. These with deep wounds are mark'd with Freedom's stamp: Burbank, and Thomas, Fisk, and Jones, and Camp. Fair Bigelow, a youth of eager mind, While leaping forward to the work design'd, Is swept to earth: A war-globe smote his side. And tore his entrails in large volumes wide. His liver, stomach, lungsâallâall are goneâ Entirely naked is the spiral bone. Insensible of pain he rolls his eyesâ His soul impatient travels to the skies. An opening poppy thus on summer's day, Puts forth its bloom exquisitively gayâ Red, purple, azureâvirgin white and gold, Trembling with beauty as its leaves unfoldâ While thus it spreads its bosom to the sun, An east wind blights itâand its charms are done. So snatch'd from life was Bigelow the braveâ His body left unsightly for the grave. Th' impetuous Cilley rushing in advance, Breaks on the enemy with naked lanceâ Single he charges on a pointed gunâ And five smites headlong, e'er they've time to shun His blade of pestilence. But Holbrook nigh, Exchang'd with Cilley a provoking eyeâ And stooping to the hand that held the match, Unlocks the dying grasp with hasty snatchâ Just in the act t' explode the brass with fire, The hero rushing, meets him in his ire! Deep through his throat he plunges in the bladeâ In matted gore the royal chief is laid. Hard on his breast the Patriot crowds his heelâ Loose from the wound he tugs the reeking steel. The Albions giveâno longer can they stand The tyger onset of the storming band. With cold reluctance from their guns they tread, Crushing in slippery blood the mangled dead. âBehold, the enemy are backward driven!â Miller triumphant with his soul in heaven;â âFull on their rear the conquer'd trophies turn, And let the quickfire with destruction burn. Niagara's Heights are ours! Sweepâstrike them down! Bow to the dust the head that bears a Crown!â The born of Liberty his voice obeyâ And on the foe the brazen engines playâ But yet he lingers on the crimson browâ And dark on Miller gashes blow for blow. But Ripley comes resistless from the right, And at a thrust makes desolate the Height. Their wings, their centre, every file gives wayâ By death o'erwhelm'd, they break in disarray. Mad fire and thunderbolts pursue them stillâ Like dust in whirlwinds they forsake the hill. CANTO XXX. BATTLE OF NIAGARA CONTINUED. ARGUMENT. The English make several attempts to recover the Heights, but are as often driven back with great slaughter. The sceneâHeights of Niagara .... The time is about two hours. âAges to come your deeds will be renown'd!â (Ripley, transported, to his warriors round,) âNo mortal tongue can strike your note of praiseâ Your names, your characters, in future days Will shine resplendent as the polar light, Shaming the stars that ornament the night! âThe faint and weltering to the rear convey, Ready to stand offensive in the frayâ For soon may we expect this Drummond on, To wipe away the spot that stains the crown. The wounded were remov'dâas Brown the chief, Arose the hill, and Jessup with relief. To Miller, Ripley,âBrown his bosom gave: âThis night you've bid defiance to the grave! Soon may your bodies moulder on the heath, But lo, your names will live exempt from death. âApproving, I behold your enterprise, To be prepar'd against a hostile rise, Should they attempt the Heights. The centre take, And with your soul like jealousy awake, Defend the triumph. Jessup, on the right, Display your warriors crown'd with starry light; From Ripley's flank a vacance leave between, Hindman to occupy with thunder men. Porter will stand upon the left extreme, Whose volunteers have pass'd the trying flame. âThus will our line be form'd. I'll swift descend, And urge them forth the Summit to defend.â This said. He wheel'd and dash'd upon the plain, While Ripley clear'd the field of Royals slain, Which on his front rais'd something like a moundâ So vast their numbersâto defend the ground. Brown, Porter first salutedâne'er controll'd In battle by a foeâhis purpose told: âAdvance your volunteers, whose throbbing will Is ever ripe, the enemy to kill. For you, the left of Ripley I've assign'd, To prove your rich inheritance of mind. It cannot be, but Drummond will arise With vengeance heated, to regain the prize.â Porter receiv'd the orderâwheel'd his band To form on Ripley, and like stars to stand. Brown visits Hindman next: âBrave man, proceed And reach the climax of a warrior's meed. Lead forth with Towson, Riddle, and Ritchie, Born to inherit Freedom's legacy. Ascend and glorify the Heights aboveâ Reveal the sinews of your heart steel-woveâ There plant your enginery, and those made ours By Miller's charge and Ripley's deathless powers. For thee there's space reserv'd vacant between Ripley's brigade and Jessup's matchless men.â Scarce had the chief the circumstance proclaim'd, When Hindman, Towson, with their hearts inflam'd, Advanc'd to do what ne'er before was done Beneath the shining stars or burning sun. By this Brown check'd his courser at the spot, Where stood the cohorts of the fighting Scott. âIs Scott upon the field?â Brown cried aloud,â âHe is.â The warrior answer'd from the crowd, âAnxious I've waited to receive thy willâ Shall I move forward to defend the hill?â While Scott thus spoke he hasten'd at the call. âForever foremost where the showering ball Sings through the element!â Brown full rejoins,â âIn proud reserve retain thy bleeding lines. All fashion of applause thy deeds surpassâ Never scarce equall'd since creation was.â Publish'd his orders, Brown regains the Height, And takes his station to observe the fight. The meantime Drummond with his eyes inflam'd, These dark emotions of his soul proclaim'd: âLet thunder strike the wholeâheaven mix with hell! There's nothing past with this can parallel! And have I been with deep disgrace compell'd To fly by those who never foe beheld? And can it be that we have England lostâ We, who made Europe curdle like a frost? Never to us this darkness shall be givenâ Where stand we now?âback from the Summit driven! âThe wheels of earth are block'd! Britannia's powerâ Her fame for ages, wither'd in an hour! Albion is conquer'd by unroyal raceâ And must her brow be stain'd with the disgrace? Ocean, freeze to rockâEarth, dissolve to seaâ Stars, turn to darknessâlet the heavens decayâ âAnd Riallâwhere was he?âhad he but come With the reserveâthis night had been their doom! Seiz'dâcaptur'd by surprize!âempty in skullâ Born at the world's eclipseâa name of ridicule. âThis never I'll endureânoââ Hervey here Rode up and broke this language to his ear: âMost royal Drummond!âevery breast as one, Regrets that we by Freedom were outdone. Not we must think that forms of men we fightâ At plains of Chippewa we felt their might. Yes, we must waken and exert our power, Then will the Eagle to the Lion cower. When lions, tygers, meet in crossing mood, If they their strength put forth they have their blood; But if they treat the tyger race with scorn, By their unequals are they cast forlorn. âCome, cast away these thoughts: Thy legions now Stand and demand due vengeance of the foe. They wait thy orders to assail the Height, And blot from memory the dastard flight. Firm on the dexter wing thy brother standsâ Sheffie, death's agent, on the left commands. âThe foe I've compass'd with observance stillâ No doubt is mine but we'll regain the hill. We far outflank them on their both extremes, So much superior are our royal names. Each feels his heart determin'd to ascend, And to the Cross the Eagle standard bend.â As when a band of wolves by hunters bold, With fire assaulted in their rocky hold, Break in a panick from the flames of death, Scarce waiting in their flight to taste of breath. Their leader feeling more than all their pain, A frenzied passion fastens on his brain. A blaze electrick shoots from every hairâ His boisterous yell sends torment through the airâ He stalks disorder'd in a raving mood, His eyeballs floating in a tide of blood. His tongue hangs feverish o'er his foaming jaws,â He digs the flinty earth with bleeding claws, And in delirium snaps them with his teethâ A stream of fire commingled with his breath. While thus enrag'd, a milder wolf draws nigh, And speaks the promise of a victoryâ Th' unbridled fury boiling in his breast, By slow degrees calm settles into rest: So Hervey's language Drummond's rage subdu'dâ And him he answer'd in a gentler mood. âMost true, the centre of my heart was ire, But thou hast chang'd it to a new desire. I'll go with triumph sounding on my tongue, And give them power to rise with madness strong.â This said, he bounded on his charger proudâ His tyger voice vociferates aloud: âAnd why for thunder did you quit the hill? Rise from this infamyâthe dark dispel! In line hard wedg'd move forward to the shockâ Standâshould the Height a reeling cradle rock! At twice ten footsteps distant from the foe, Loosen the fire-springsâmake their standard bow. The volley thrice repeatedâsteel in handâ Rushâand let blood be seen upon the land. âNow to the musick give a furious beat, And tread vitality beneath your feet!â Like folds of darkness in their strength they move, Loud as rough storms which bellow through the grove. While thus the Britons,âRipley view'd his line, And, as he pass'd, he open'd his design: âStand with a plated heart the storm to faceâ 'Twill soon be hereâthey'll never brook disgrace, That we inferior should their ranks assail, And drive them broken,âwhirlwind'd down the hill. âNow bend your ears and hearken to obeyâ Throw not a ball with heedless aim awayâ Your arms keep ready till the foe shall fire, Then, by their blaze with coolâbut strong desire, Sparkle the flint! Should not the royals stand To burn the balls, but come with blade in hand, Be solid rocks till you their points shall feel, Then, plunging, search their bosoms with the steel. Listen!âthey come! Attend their rising sound! This night each brow shall be with laurel crown'd!â Scarce had he spoken when the Britons nigh, Footsteps twice ten, stream'd fire along the skyâ The bullets spent their rage upon the airâ But not thus vain the patriot vollies bearâ Cool at the blazing through the dark they aim, So true, each flash subdues a royal name. The English ranks recoil. But soon they stand, Cemented,âlock'd,âexcited by command. And now the battle burning in its ire, Appears in likeness to Vesuvian fire. At length such numbers of the Albions bleed, They with death's palsy from the hill recede. Ripley is heard: âHard iron is your nerve, Never to bend! Your discipline preserve! Not with this effort will the Drummonds yield, Accustom'd ever to a conquering field. Keep in deep silence muffled, till they come And give us light to guide them to the tomb!â Each warrior planted, felt himself a rock, To meet the conflict in its wildest shock. Drummond ascending, overtakes his force, And rage supplies him with a mad discourse: âAnd whither are ye bent? A wretch that flies, Without the respite of a moment dies! Fronts, change from left to right. In person now, I lead the charge to subjugate the foe! The dastard that recedes from courage true, The next upon his rear, transfix him through!â They stand,âthey form,âtheir heavy fronts they change, And fix'd in purpose, up the hill they range. They gain their distanceâDrummond swells his voice: âUnkey the arch of heaven with thunder noise!â The mandate given, they kindle as before, And break the concave with a deafening roarâ But the cool efforts of the patriot line, To graves of blood their proudest names consign. They chokeâthey stifle with the furnace fireâ They faulterâreelâa second time retire. Lo, now by striving with superior strength, The patriot army fail in nerve at length: Thus when Connecticut is swell'd by snow Melting with rains from off the mountain's browâ Though swift the flood, yet nothing it appals The hardy watermen of Entick falls. The freighted boat they loosen from the shore, And bend their might upon the pole and oar;â The proud waves tossing dash against its brow, Which makes it tremble urging it belowâ Yet the strong river-men with shoulders bent, And hands hard grappled with a firm intent, Propel the barge slow creeping through its length, Their every sinew swollen with its strength. The sweat streams reeking from their bosoms bareâ Herculian efforts straightening every hair. At times, upon the foaming flood they gainâ At times they stand, bent, pressing at a strain. The boat now gives an inch, a foot, a yard, By panting struggles of the labourers hard. They catch new footing, vigorous as at first, And walk it upward, nor their powers distrust. At length, by energy severe applied, Above the falls in waters smooth they ride! But now, behold, their vast exertions o'er, A fainting languor seizes every pore. Their powers exhausted to an infant meek, They feel like slumber with their breathings weak: So while the fight the patriot bosom fir'd, They felt no fibre of their nature tir'd, But when the Britons second time withdrew, They wilted down like flowers depriv'd of dewâ Their throats were parch'dâand water was the cryâ Their vessels drain'd, and no deliverance nigh! The pressing call struck Brown's attentive earâ He comes with sweeping motion from the rear, A fountain on his tongue! âImmortal band! The strength, the pride, the bulwark of the landâ The more we suffer in our persons each, The farther into time our names will reach! âYour general neither hath he eat or drankâ He suffers equal with the lowest rankâ What words are these?âthem, instant I recallâ This night, each soldier is a general! We'll outbrave nature, nor a word repine, And be like something that is half divine! âRemember that our dearest all's at stakeâ With joy we'll suffer for our country's sake. And will we render up the glorious spoil, This night acquir'd through sweat, through blood, and toil? We never will!âdieâdieâby piecemeal firstâ Loosen the heart-strings and return to dust! Cast off this weakness! Stand, resist the charge, And let th' immortal of your life be large!â His voice reviv'd them like a summer showerâ Their every fibre gain'd increase of power. Brief, like a charm, their every pain was goneâ A noble triumph o'er their sufferings won! Brown to his place withdrew, which late he held T' observe the various movements of the field. The second time the Albions fled the scene, Vincent, from George, came forward with his men. They stood in columns with a haughty port, All fresh and vigorous for a bold effort. Drummond took heart when he beheld him nigh, With ample means to raise their feelings high. Largely to each he dealt th' inspiring cheer, Tightening their nervesâdispelling every fear. The past is vanish'dâin their rank they formâ Vincent in front to lead the final storm. Impenetrably lock'd, their shoulders joinâ Their flanks of infantry in double line. Drummond, proud rising in his hope, began: âTheir life is now but as a narrow span! This the third chargeâand conquerors are we! Now shall they bend subjective on the knee! The Heights are ours! It never shall be said, That thrice the Lion from the Eagle fled. By this, must they be fainting with their toilâ Yes, with their blood we'll wash away the soil! Waken the fireâthen press the iron charge With: Down to FreedomâVictory to George!â Boasting he spoke. His warriors beat the ground With heavy footsteps,âsending forth a sound, Like falling waters, distant, roaring, loud, Or thunders muttering from a brewing cloud. The Patriots listening, catch the hostile tread, Gathering deep turbulence with rising dread. Ripley reminds them of their former fame: âFirst they the Height will kindle into flame! Keep the eye jealous on the object bentâ And at the flash, set fire the element!â By this, the enemy had rose the Height, And at the measur'd distance struck the light With sound that shook the hill. Miller, and Brook Open and blind them with the fire and smoke. Porter, invincible, with volunteers, Renews the war, like blazing up the spheres. Jessup wings lightning from Columbia's right, And Towson, Hindman, split the ears of Night. The line of Ripley is a wall of fire, Arching above the whole a circle higher. The Albions bleed by ranks. Yet Vincent's band Close up the files of those that press the landâ But those who'd seen the hill in flames before, Break in disorder, trailing back the gore. âShadows of men! a liver-hearted crew!â Drummond impassion'd with his features blue;â âWhy shrink ye back? Think not of Death's abode! Seize, seize the cannon, and let stream the blood!â While this was said, he toss'dâhe foam'd with rageâ His squadrons rally and with power engage. Fires flash, steels ring, blood gushes, thunders burstâ Man gasps his soul awayâhis body sinks to dust! While thus the adverse arms unsparing kill, Scott with impatience bounded up the hill, He stood a moment and the slaughter ey'dâ Then swift descended and abruptly cried: âAre these, my veterans, ready with the sword?â He never paus'd to hear the answering word, But thus continu'd on: âIn column form, With left in frontâand forward to the storm!â Scarce he this utter'd, when his will was doneâ Against the Albion left he leads them on. âForward! sunder their flank!â rising he said: They rush with bayonets and augment the dead. But lo, the double lines resist the chargeâ In stern defiance of what Scott can urge. He sees the effort vain: âThe left, in rear! The column change!âthe right, in front appear!â The line revers'd, he leads it to the right With rapid movement, guided by the light That glimmers o'er the field: âWe'll strike once more, And break the lock or weaken it of power. The bayonet port, and charge!â The brief command Is swift obey'dâthey press with steel in hand. The wing reels back like drunk'nessâbut at length, In closer wedge it stands with iron strength. The aids that bore his mandates, Smith and Worth, Urging a pass fell wounded to the earth, Hence, Scott conveys his orders far and nearâ Shows where to wheel, and where to drive the spear. Young Hull his valour prov'dâthe son of him, Who made the lustre of the Stars grow dimâ Who, from our standard took away its gemâ Its honourâfar more precious than the gold, For which his diamond flag he treacherous soldâ His son inherited his valour high, The time he banner'd with Montgomeryâ His father's weakness cut his heart in twainâ He sought the field to wipe away the stain: The deaths were many that his steel had made, But in the act to parry off a blade, Drawn fiercely back with full intention bent, Through Scott's unguarded bosom to be sent,â He miss'd his aim, and took himself the steel! It pierc'd his neckâbath'd in his blood he fell. His timeless death his country will revere, Howe'er so dark his father's character. The traveller pointing to his tomb, will say: âThere lies a youth who fell in dubious fray, Whose Father's treachery the world condemns!â Yesâhe will sparkle with th' illustrious gems, Whose splendid beams illuminate the earthâ Such the abiding excellence of worthâ For crime is not inherited from birth. While Scott was soul-engag'd, a bullet came, Urged in its speed with violence of flame, And through the muscles of his shoulder spedâ But mad in fight he never turn'd his headâ Scarce from the sunder'd vessels gush'd the tide. When lo, another pierc'd him in his side! Yet still his sword he brandish'd on the foe. And in the dust was laid full many a brow; Henshaw, and Orwell, found their efforts vainâ They fell before him with their skulls in twain. At length, he marks the trickling of the gore From either wound, which naught he'd felt beforeâ And thus to Leavenworth: âThe column join To Jessup's right, and there defend the line. My heart is faintingâsad must I retireâ Warriors! be firm!âyour general's last desire!â It damp'd their eyes with tearsâThey file away Fix'd in their purpose to maintain the fray, They, on the right of Jessup, planted stand, And drive a flame which desolates the land. Jones to the Chippewa the general bears, Whose name will live a round of endless years! Meanwhile the turbulence of battle grewâ Rising in passion,âeach the other slew, Griping with death. Lo, now beyond the mound Of pil'd-up dead, the Britons press the ground. The warriors wade in gore. Behind the slain, The blood collectsâas when that showers of rain, After long drought excite the streams to move, And cause the dried-up rivers to improveâ The dykes are fill'dâthe dams that drive the mills, And those that yield smooth water to canalsâ Like this, behind the slain the blood collects, Which partial, like a bulwark mound, protects The patriot warriors from the furious rush Of royal powers advancing with a crush Now this, now that gives backânow these, now thoseâ Man crowds on manâblows deep resound on blows. Ten thousand living fires elance the lead, While solid thunders shake the hill with dread. The quick blue flashes on the eyeballs glareâ Unsated Havock ravens like despair. With numerous chiefs belonging to the crown, Sheffie falls wounded from his charger down, Deep splashing in the blood. With knee broke short, In vain he struggles for his life's supportâ A press of soldiers crowding o'er the plain, Smothers his lifeâhe mingles with the slain. Columbians sleep in fame. Among the rest, Was fair Ritchie, offspring Virginia's best. From scenes of affluenceâa parent's arms, He'd rush'd his bosom into war's alarms. His Country's love was to his heart more dear, Than sister's friendship or a mother's tear. Across his gun his sword had slain its four, The stoutest warriors of the Albion power. Th' impetuous Hervey as he slew the last, His falchion levell'd with a sweeping castâ Its point just split his skull, saving the brain, As he stood leaning o'er the recent slain; But cleft the ribs between his shoulders strongâ Down sunk the hero on the earth along. Hindman forth rushing smote the Briton's head, Wide flew his brainsâhe fell on Ritchie dead. So hard, two engines now, the royals crowdâ âSteel spike the vents!â Hindman proclaim'd aloud. 'Tis doneâbefore the press the brave withdraw, While Drummond's thousands shout for conquering war: âThey give,âthey break,âwe triumph,âEngland towers! Behold, the thunders of the Height are ours!â Brief was their shouting. Lo, the jealous Brown Heard,âand majestick from the rear came down. Fredonia breathes her spirit in his soulâ His rising presence re-inspires the whole! Like Sodom hail the balls around him fly, And one to stay his progress breaks his thighâ Another rends his sideâtearing his meltâ But not Death's arrow would the champion felt! His eye wink'd notâon in his might he strode O'er hills of dead and ghastly scenes of blood. The scream of ghosts is heard at every sweepâ The hill no longer can the Albions keepâ Dishearten'dâbrokenâall their strength is downâ They shrink, they shiver with the wrath of Brown: Thus while a timid flock are sleeping still, Beneath the jutting summit of a hill, A panther comes with rushing in the nightâ Some wake no more, while others wing their flight. With bleatings of distress they load the airâ Frenzied they break, and scatter here and thereâ At times they apprehend they feel his teeth, And without struggle render up to death: Thus fled the royal hostânor look'd behind, So dire the war, it wither'd up their mindâ They flew like up-toss'd gossamer in wind. END OF VOL. III. VOL. IV. CANTO XXXI. DEFENCE OF FORT ERIE. ARGUMENT. Invocation .... Address to the Moon .... Vision of Fredonia .... The Columbians retire to fort Erie .... Drummond, after taking possession of the Heights, follows the retreating Army ... Skirmishing .... The Assault. The Scene.âHeights of the Niagara .... Chippewa .... and at fort Erie. The time is ten days. Songs thirty have I sung, yet ten remainâ Crude, undigested, written in the brain; Fancy and Memory must cull the linesâ Labour immense to finish the designsâ Then Liberty and Peace with hallow'd tongue, Will join harmonious to conclude the song. Thenâthen unstrung, my fretted harp shall restâ Whilst anxious weight will lighten from my breast! O, but the thought gives inspiration sweet! It makes my pulse in dancing measures beat! Vouchsafe my heart its musick, heavenly Muse! And bathe my bosom in celestial dewsâ At times I faintâBut, lo, methinks I feel A thrill divine,âbeyond me to reveal! Is it thy whisperings moving on my soul, Fanning desire, that my new verse will roll Down the far stream of timeâand aid to keep My Country lock'd in links of Union deep? That then the poet shall his fame receiveâ That, though in dust, his pencill'd thoughts will live! Is this the sound that gladdens in mine ear, Crowding mine eyes delicious with a tear? O, if it be but a delusive dream, Yet I'll enjoy the transport of the theme! Live in neglectâcare nothing to be seen, If, in the roll of years, my numbers will be green! Fill'd with this hope, in clearer notes I'll sing, For thou, O Muse, wilt plenteous musick bringâ Yea, thou canst tune my numbers to complete My Song of Freedom to sublime and sweet. A tapestry of mist the Queen of Night Drew round her form, and sadden'd at the sightâ But now, not hearing of the battle loud, Slow she disrobes her bosom from the cloud. Alas! what horror doth her light revealâ The wasted gore runs trickling down the hill! Death pil'd on death, and broken sword-steels red, And the pale faces of the warriors dead. Horse on his rider, bleedingâSkull bones bare, Cast back the moon-beams with a hideous glare, Like that reflected from a spectre's cheek, Haunting the tombs its rotten dust to seek! The silver-bosom'd daughter of the spheres Turns from the scene, and vails herself in tears! Fair Queen of heaven! doth sorrow dim thine eye For human grief, whilst travelling through the sky? Ah, yesâI mark affliction on thy brow, And tear-drops trickling down thy cheeks of snow. O thou hast touch'd that something in my breast, That makes me happy even when distress'd! Alas! for man there's ample cause to mournâ He falls to dustâahânever to return! Though now thy course is waning on decline, Yet soon thy horns shall fill, and gladly shineâ Not so with manâa flower in bloom to-dayâ To-morrow fadedâmouldering into clay! And is the grave the allâthe last of manâ His strength but weakness, and his life a span? Fair Mourner! tell thy bended suppliant here, If man exist beyond thy lovely sphere? If but to feed the grave-yard worms be all, For which he buffets on this tossing ballâ O then, more close fold up thy thickening cloudâ Stain it to blackness, like the coffin shroud! But if the soul beatitude shall find, Bless'd in the presence of th' eternal Mindâ Dismuffle from thy vailâpour down thy rays, And let me, ravish'd, on thy beauty gaze! Mark! mark the sign! the clouds disparted fly! She looks new burnish'd from the Deity! Gaze, O ye mortals! bend your eye to heavenâ Behold the promise of a life new given! Around thy silver robes, Night's holy Queen! The forms of angels in their bliss are seen! The Muse feels rapt, as with Elijah's fireâ Propitious omen! man shall not expire! He, like thyself, a transient season dies, To shine eternal in the vital skies! Brown's warring passions stay'd, he felt the pain Of either wound, and fil'd from off the plain; Fast by an oak, his war-horse, 'reft of pride, Drain'd of his blood, laid down, and groan'd, and died. The oak, by Spencer's hand, sustain'd the chief, Who, though in anguish, gave this mandate brief: âSpencer, returnâbid Ripley, with a wall Circle the Heights, impervious to the ball.â The youth obey'dâa moment, he was goneâ The warrior, feverish with his wounds, alone. Lo, the Protectress of Columbia's fame, In fashion of a dreaming image, cameâ The lineaments of Washington assum'd, And thus his mind persuasive she illum'd: âThink not, my son, though gash'd with wounds severe, Thou art an object less of guardian careâ 'Tis oft the purposes of Him above To chasten, when His features smile with love. How soon these mouths will heal, and then the scars Will deck thy name, as heaven by yon bright stars. âLet deep-weigh'd thoughts be thine: Stretch not too far Their tired nerve, exhausted in the war. Never was earth by mightier heroes trod, But call to mind, that strength depends on blood. I plac'd my Country in the bower of Peace, By oft retreating, when I'd won the race. â'Twill yield no lofty honour to contend 'Gainst swarming thousands, and the hill defend; Vast multitudes are gathering from the sea In crowded fleets to dash thy fame away. Recall to mind, how small thy numbers are But what are wounded, or in death-robes, there. Thy late command annulâand forth array Thy fainting warriors to the Chippewa; From thence, the maim'd, with fever in their blood, Can soft be glided o'er the yielding flood. Those, with their strength unbroken in the war, At day's new birth, to Erie will repair. You at the village Schlosser. patiently remain, Till these deep wounds are heal'd, and you regain Your powers exhaustedâable to command, And do yet larger honours for the land. âHeed these my wordsâto you indulgent given, And be by succour in the arm of Heaven.â She said: And vanish'd like a vision bright, Or passing meteor, that illumes the nightâ Brown, lost in reverie, mark'd her as she flew And hid her image from his wondering view. What time she spake, his wounds forgot to burnâ But now the lancings of their fires returnâ And every thought Fredonia left behind, Seems but the inward workings of his mind. It happens thus, when age dries up the brain, No action recent doth the mind retainâ But what this moment pictures on the eye, The next dissolves it into vacancy: So, from the cause of fever-working pain, Her image and her voice forsook his brain. Spencer ere this had reach'd the gory ground, Where Ripley stoodâhis officers around: âOpposite yon star, against an oak is Brown, With half the fountain of his heart run down, Yet, in anxiety, his wounds are lostâ He bids you mound against the gathering host, That never they of these proud Heights shall boast.â Ripley, solicitous, to him returns: âI joy to hear the vital lamp still burns Warm in the hero's breast. I've search'd the plains, Expecting there to find his cold remainsâ For those, who saw him in the battle's heat, No hope encourag'd that his life yet beat. I thought, when I beheld him, of the three, Who dwelt in fire, untouch'd with injury! âSpencer, awayâdirect me to the chief, For I must aid him in his hour of grief. âWarren, though young, yet eminent in skillâ Whose uncle fell at the immortal Hillâ You'll forth with us to bind the hero's wound, And save his blood from wasting on the ground. âPorter, the labour of the mound commenceâ Though in exhaustion, we must strive defence. âSpencer, the rowel to your courser plyâ We waitâwe lingerâlike a racer, fly.â Brown musing sat beneath the rustling tree, His brow upon his hand,âhis elbow on his knee Leaning his head. When he their coming heard, He rais'dâThey haltâHe harks to Ripley's word: âAnd dost thou yet survive! Never, alas, I apprehended to behold thy face; We thought, none mortal could the flames withstoodâ But I the surgeon from your wounds exclude. âI'll but a moment more: Both friend and foe Toward the Chippewa are moving slow. The dead are gather'd in a funeral pileâ But first of blood we had to drain the hill. Though weak our means, we'll labour to surround Th' immortal Height with trench and breasted mound.â Brown proves his soul yet great: âThis order learnâ No hand of healing serves me till my turn. The last was I upon the field that bled, Hence till the last my wounds shall be delay'd. âThe instructions late, which I by Spencer sent, I now annul; my mind is different bent. We must recede, our losses to repairâ The warriors ask this tenderness of care. Brief be the march to Chippewa begunâ Wait not the rising of the absent sun. âI at the village shall remain with those, Broken in fight, till these my wounds shall close. Early at dawn you'll measure back the plains, And join at Erie with the valiant Gaines.â Modest, thus Ripley: âThy superior grade Gives to thy word a power to be obey'd Unargu'dâbut rescinding the command Will prove the life of our exhausted band. âThe captur'd guns repeatedly I've strove From off the Height in safety to remove. But every wain unlimber'dâhorses slain, Toil'd is our strength to bear them o'er the plain. Hardly I know what method to propose; To leave them here would gratify our foes.â Thus he, perplex'd: Brown forth his views explains: âNecessity binds all in iron chains. Its voice must be obey'd, though it should wring The core of life, and tears of anguish bring. Man is but man at best; he can no more Than do his utmost to exert his power. âIf fail our means to move the cannon now, Them plunging hurl upon the rocks below. And if it cause a bolstering of their pride, They must, in this event, be gratified. âLet me no longer with my words detain Your presence here; but haste with loosen'd rein Back to the field. The night full half is spent By yonder star that lights the firmament.â Ripley in friendship gave the chief his hand; Mounted his steed, and sought his hosted bandâ Hosted!âalas, a cohort scarce remain; The rest are scarr'd, or number'd with the slain. The cannon chok'd with steelâtheir trunnions broke, Headlong they dash them from the beetling rock. They march in silenceâSoon the Chippewa They reachâand there their pressing wants allay. Spencer, and Dix, and Austin,âaids to Brown, Slow, with soft bearing, move the hero on. In the same yawl is plac'd both him and Scottâ So valu'd freight ne'er press'd a swimming boat! Next they convey the wounded in their turn, During their healing thither to sojourn. Soon as the east gave promises of light, They march'd for Erie's fort, and reach'd the same at night. Now as the day comes blushing with the morn, By the drums' rattle and the bugle-horn, The Albions, brokenâscatter'd, desolate, From part remote, slow-moving, congregateâ Silent they formâdepression in their eye, Blank'd with despair, with shame, and misery: Thus when Vesuvius, for a century round, Had quiet slept, without an angry soundâ The grape, the olive, and the fig, were seen Exuberant, blooming on its brow sereneâ The kid, light-leaping, and the grazing sheepâ The heavy mules slow-pacing up the steepâ The rural cottage, grac'd with curling smokeâ The white-chaf'd waters of the dashing brookâ The smiling hamlets, scatter'd here and there, Breathing life's essence from the heaven-wash'd air,â Bedeck'd with beauty all the mountain's bound, While light-wing'd happiness swam floating round: At length, exploding with a fiery blast, The scene is chang'dâits loveliness is past! The grape, the olive, and the fig-tree, dieâ The kid, the lambs, in boiling lava fryâ The mule is crush'd beneath a burning rockâ Mad fire-streams roll, where late the dashing brookâ The rural cottage, where it smiling stood, Coy to be seen beneath the embowering wood, And every hamlet, breathing life from heaven, Sad to the wasting of the flames are given; And all the mountain, that was late so fair, Is wrapp'd in ruins, desolate and bare. Like this the Albions, in their pride serene, On tiptoe fancy plough'd the sparkling greenâ Deck'd with embroider'd stars, fantastick flowers, To strangle Freedom in their sportive hoursâ But, lo, the recent slaughter of the fight Had wound their fancy in the shroud of nightâ Their stars fantastick, and their flowers, no more Remain the emblems of their boasted power. Broke, blighted, wither'd by the recent blast, They stand despairing, with their looks aghast. Drummond a cavern in his panick found, Whose narrow path from the Niagara wound. Gladly he enter'd to avoid the strife, And, from the tumult, shelter with his life. He laid him down, and soon a feverish sleep Began slow-limping o'er his brain to creep. At times, he utter'd forth his dream: âI'm down! Kill me no more,âI yield the banner'd Crown! Let me swim out, I'm choking in the blood! Deafen'd with groansâa dying multitude,â See earth with flames dissolve!âThe hand of Death! I faint,âI dieâhell-monsters rise beneath!â Thus wild, his fancy frenzied up his brains, His blood, at times, congealing in his veins, And then it swell'd them with the strength of fire, Then ebbing back, he'd struggle to expire. But soon the passion festering at his heart Would cause a dream the cavern vaults to start. Thus through the night, he toss'd with his despair, Like some defeated tyger in his lair. Lo, now the Fiend, in hermit's rude attire, Approachesâburden'd to produce a fire, With faggots gather'd as he pass'd the wood, Which boreal winds had o'er the pathway strew'd; A hoary beard descends upon his breast, A shaggy girdle compasses his waist, In which, a book of faith is partial seen, Like other hypocrites.âHis cheeks are lean; His tatter'd cloak, of party-colour'd dyes, But hides in part the lankness of his thighs. His knees are callous, as though worn with prayer, And stooping as he moves, he mutters to the air. Drummond awakening with an aspect wild, Starts from the Fiend: âFear not, my honour'd child! Though bare by nature fedâmy cavern poor, Yet, to the afflicted, open is my door; It glads my heart to do my fellow goodâ I've shunn'd deceitful man for solitude, Where I in meditation can commune On holy things, when this rude war is done. And Brown departed, now my hopes revive, That I unknown in quietness shall live.â âWhat language this you hold? My nerves you thrillâ And hath that butcher vanish'd from the hill? My bosom dances!âYetâI yet distrust, Though thou art holy and thy looks are just.â âNot this surprise createsâman is deceit; From youth to age, he studies but to cheat, Hence words, divine as truth, we disbelieve, Yea, not our credence to the righteous give,â Therefore illusive, you my voice distrust, It proves the frailty of our brittle dust. âBut come, I'll prove it to your heart's content, That he, at midnight, made his vanishment.â Drummond reluctant doubtingly complied; They mov'd together, lock'd in arm aside. Two thirds the distance he arose the hill, But there he stopp'd, his bosom in a chill; With coward lips, joints trembling, he began: âBehold, what object! their approaching van! And see you not a marshall'd host in view? I fear some spy hath told you things untrue! Quick from the danger let us wheel, retireâ Methinks they aim, in readiness to fire!â He turn'd, and strove to flyâbut fast the Fiend Restrain'd his flight: âDeceiv'd art thou, my friend, The smoke hath made thee dimâthere's nothing there Save floating vapours dancing in the air, Raised by the warming sunbeams. Rest on me, And soon from doubt your vision shall be free.â Drummond took heartâyet onward moved he slow, Step after step with wildness on his brow. Thus had a wolf been driven from the fold, Till scarce with panting, he his breath could hold; Pursu'd by hounds, exhausted, wounded, heat, Till every muscle pour'd a stream of sweat. But soon by rumour passing by his den, He hears the flock are led by shepherd men Beyond his late defeat: With cautious tread He ventures forth to feast upon the dead, If any left behind. 'Twixt hope and doubt, With wildness strange, he throws his eyes about; By fangs receiv'd, on the preceding day, His feet for trembling scarce sustain his way. Yea, even from afar, to view the plain, Brings all the soreness on his flesh again. With nostril on the ground, and eye oblique, He pauses now; and now a tame thing weak, Cowering he creeps, in terror to descry The crouchant mastiffs at his throat to fly: So Drummond fearful like the wolf proceeds, His vacillating thoughts like shaken reeds. At length he gain'd the summit, yet his eye Search'd for the lurking of an enemy; But when his guide advanc'd him to the rock, From whence were hurl'd his conquer'd cannon broke, Sudden his heart was bloated into pride, And to himself like acclamation cried: âThis, this is triumph! How it throbs my breast! My thoughts come rushing, not to be express'd! My soul was darkness, for my honour stain'd, But now have I the dubious contest gain'd! They've fled before me, like the chaff in wind! What deep disgrace, had I to them resign'd! Now, I a knighthood from the king shall find! How every tongue my honours will proclaim! Yea, I shall breathe the element of fame!â While thus transported, soft the Fiend withdrew To hold a conclave with his Stygian crew; To aid convention now about to meet, To rend the States, their Country to defeat. Drummond no thought upon the hermit cast, His mind elate the circumstance effac'd; He met his guards, they furnish'd him a horse, And led him on to where his gather'd force Stood in dejection, every feeling low, Like marble statues, weeping in their wo. Drummond approach'd with gladness in his look, And unexpected of a vict'ry spoke. âWhy stand ye thus with heavy brows cast down? And know ye not, that we the field have won? Lo, yonder Height is ours! The foe hath fled; Not fruitless, hence our choicest veins have bled! All, all, yea all have vanish'd like a dream, And left to us the victory supreme! Well did I know, that we such fire had dealt That they before us, as the dew, would melt! âVincent, thy bands, two thousand out of ten, Who still have life to breathe with living men, Proud on their frontlets shall Niagara bear, To tell the world, that we the conquerors were!â As when the surly East sweeps round the field, And all the peasant's hopes begin to yield; Sickening at heart, he dooms his harvest done, Wasted his labours in the burning sun; Behold, the balmy South, on odorous wing, Visits the earth; the birds their love-notes sing; The swain rejoices in the vital soundâ His tightening nerves, like music chords, rebound: So when the Albions heard their general speak, They felt their hearts a new sensation strike. By files, he 'ploys the line; with spirits light, Beating quick musick, they ascend the Height. Their broken engines from the cavern deep They tug, and sweat and labour up the steep. They plant them round to make a martial show, While their hearts tremble to pursue their foe. With pompous circumstance they swell the theme, But now are anxious to ascend the stream, The Patriots on their march to overtake, Their sleeping wrath in violence to wake. Now when the circle of the day was spent, And to the east th' unwieldly shadows bent, De Watteville with thousands rose the height, A man of daring and affections bright. Soon as his columns halted on the hill, Drummond saluted him with borrow'd smile. âMy heart beats happiness to hail you now, It makes my breast with gladness overflow; Though half my host they've buried in the tomb, Yet now deliverance for the past hath come. Forth we'll proceed and search them on retreat, And bow their standard humble to our feet. View, view the Heightâthe copiousness of blood, Fattening the earth, it seemed at times a flood! A wilderness on fire is likeness faint, Compar'd with that which fill'd the element. As falls the summer grass, so swept we them, Or cluster'd insects shaken from a stem. Their globes the bearers of our cannon brokeâ We steel'd their vents and gave them stroke for stroke; For oft we battled with the blade in hand; At length, they struck, and scatter'd from the land, Their blood-streams gushing on the thirsty sand. When proud the sun the morrow shall renew, We'll move upon them and their flag subdue.â De Watteville replies: âMy joy is great To hear your tongue the scene articulate: And full my heart with an expression swells, That final conquest in your bosom dwells. âNow Prevost special bade me to repeat, When Brown should fold his standards at your feet, That from the west to Kingston you'll descend, And join him there, the banded States to rend. United with your strength, at Plattsburg first, 'Tis his design to make a royal thrust; From thence to Albany, his flag he'll bear, And with his army spend the winter there. âDuring the boreal reign, New-Albion true Will join the Cross, Virginia to subdue. Yea, even now, Convention is at hand, At Hartford City to divide the land.â Drummond with smiles gave token of assent; They partedâeach to his pavilion went. The shades of night, soon call'd them to the feast Of sleep luxurious, till the brightening East Should ope her gate to let the Morning forth, To give new being to the waking earth. Time turns the circling hours with steady hand, Soon Night's deep darkness shrinks at his command. Young Day with infant wings is mantling seen, Blushing beneath the early star serene. Sweet kissing with soft love, the virgin beams Dance hand in hand upon the misty streams. Light snowy wreaths from the Niagara rise To spread a banquet to admiring eyes. The sun, new risen, touches every fold With colours pour'd from heaven's rich urn of goldâ And, as he onward in his race careers, Around each dewy curl a bow appearsâ Another, and another, and another's seen, Mingling the blue, the violet, and the green In playful circles, intermingling rare Like wings of angels flickering in the air. And now, in splendid files, the royal band The Heights descend, and spread along the landâ The living multitudes successive pour, Like waves of ocean rolling on the shore. Their drums resounding, while their banners high Flout the loose clouds in pomp of chivalry. The path of Ripley eager they pursueâ At day's departure Erie swells in view. The stars are seen upon the evening's breath, And Eagle griping strong the shafts of death. In fashion of a crescent, deep they camp, And spread their tents to shelter from the damp Of falling night. For seven succeeding days, Reeking they toil, defensive mounds to raise. When from far distance, they approach'd the plains, The Patriots gather'd at the voice of Gaines, To learn their different stations of command, To deal them ruin with unsparing hand. Gaines, by his birth, was to Virginia given, Her fame to elevate, and his, to heavenâ Yea, by his deeds to stand above the earthâ A star to crown the constellation north. âYe growth of Freedom springing from the soil! With walls, deep-breasted, Drummond we must foil, And break his arm of power. With effort one, Soon shall we curb this tyger Briton down. Present are numbers here, whose passion'd blood Has proud the furnace of his wrath withstood. In open field you've melted down his power, As dew is melted in the morning hour, Yea, and I mark expression in your eye, Which speaks your valour was in infancy! âHigh on the southern bulwark, Towson stern, Be ready with your match the night to burn. The thick-wall'd battery at Erie's bank, Douglas, 'tis yours to guard our northern flank. Trimble, in front, and Riddle, Fanning youngâ Let your deep brass pour thunder from their tongue. Hindman, whose name is terror to a host, Make you the centre of the fort your post. Williams and Wadsworth, and MacDonough fair, Will play the engines and divide your care. Porter, the mound with Trimble you'll defend, Should there the enemy with steel ascend. Your cohorts, Aspinwall, will hold the right, And guard the Douglas battery in the fight. Ripley, combine your infantry with Wood, Who in the face of war has smiling stood. You'll strengthen Towson with your planted men, When in your presence shall the foe be seen. âLet each his name advanceâYou'll now withdraw, To be in readiness to meet the war. That when its turbulence shall fire the land, Unmov'd like rock-hewn pillars ye may stand.â They heardâdeparted, at the orders given, To do such deeds as elevate to heaven. Now, while intent the Albions broke the soil, The Patriots strove their rising works to spoilâ Not small the number, by the cannonade, That, void of life, upon the earth were laid. Yet still the broken parts they soon replac'd, And back the globes upon the forted cast. Incessant thus at each the war was driven, Till a moon's quarter had decreas'd in heaven; But when the gladdening sun, the eighth, arose, Gaines, with an eye that ever watch'd his foes, Beheld their engineers new lines displayâ And thus to Morgan, marshall'd in array, And Birdsallâburning for their fame severeâ Two rifle warriors, never in the rear. âChiefs of the rifle! opposite, in view, Behold them tracing an alignment new! Through yonder ravine, Birdsall, move with haste, And drive them back, and lay their labours waste. Morgan, reserv'd with your battalion stand To give him power, should Drummond's strength demand. âSoon as you rouse the enemy to war, Then on retreat be artful to withdraw, That from the fort our cannon may display A fiery prelude to th' approaching fray.â Birdsall advances without question saidâ And wars at distance with unerring lead. Morgan, reserv'd, stands jealous to descry When to advance, his arms to testify. Soon fall the science band, depriv'd of lifeâ The rest shrink backward, and avoid the strife. Drummond provok'd, their swift defeat beheld, And Tucker forth he order'd to the field. âWarrior, proceed with thy battalion strong, And strike the rifles in the dust along. Teach them repentance reckless thus to dare To leave their walls and check our bulwarks there.â Tucker with rapid movement plays his bandâ But, lo, the Greens, like rock-bound cedars, stand Braving the whole, till Morgan files his men, And, like a sweeping eagle, joins the scene. âRivet the eye upon the bead with skill! Aim at the breast, that every lead may kill. A volley, centred thus, is equal seven, Which at the enemy is sightless drivenâ âBut why this language? every flash, they dieâ They struggle for their breathâsubdu'd, they fly!â Drummond to Wilmot wheeling, briefly thus: âWhy do you stand? Behold them death to us! Around your flag the broken troops re-form, And then with steel against their bosoms storm.â Wilmot advancesâstays their flying courseâ O'erpowering files on Morgan bend their force; Unmov'd, the warrior bids explode the fireâ âAnother volley yetâanotherâand retire!â Scarce had his tongue the bold expression made, When glanc'd a death-shot burning through his head: Quivering he sunk upon the field of strifeâ But, ere he touch'd the plain, was past his life! He fellâa breathless eagle, to the earthâ He roseâa phÅnix of celestial birth! His cohorts stand, and shower with lead the plainâ Soon Wilmot, pouring of his blood, is slain! Tucker recedes with his companion dead, Who presently himself must in his shroud be laid. With heart in sorrow, Birdsall slow conveys The corse of Morgan forth:âtill time decays, His fame in brightness will improve. With solemn wo, He bears him o'er the lake to Buffaloe. There in earth's bosom he entombs his dust, Wept by the soldier and the patriot just. The sun now lingering in his chariot west, Drummond his purpose to his chiefs express'd: âTo storm the fort no longer must we wait, Or they our warriors will annihilate. Our strength is failing like a river, when The fountain streamlets cease upon the plain. Defeat will come of this.âWe melt away Like snow, that wastes beneath the solar ray. This night we'll put our royalty to test, No more for them the sun shall gild the west. âFisher, your legions to the south lead forth, And seize and hurl their cannon to the earth; Drummond, my brother, thou the fort assail, And thick with shrieking ghosts oppress the gale. Nott, to the north in silence guide the way, The Douglas battery at the lake essay. Tucker, in column your divisions stand, To give support, should failing strength demand. âHeed every circumstance: See pikes and ball, And nitrous dust, and scaling ladders all, At hand and readyâDrummond, Col. Drummond. you and Nott Curb your impatience till the fight grows hot Towards the southâthe hostile powers between Yon lofty mound and Fisher's royal-men. But when the action shall engage them there, Then on the battery and the fortress bear. âAt second watch beyond the midnight hour, Begin the onset with a crush of power.â Th' instructions given, his officers proceed To arrange their armies for the midnight deed. Scarce had they gain'd their standards, when a shell Red hissing from a regal mortar fell, Deep in the fort, beside a magazineâ Which swift exploding, flam'd the dust within! A peal of thunder travell'd o'er the earth,â A volum'd fire sprung sudden into birth And flash'd to heavenâRejoic'd, the Albions high Outpour'd a shout, which tore along the sky.â The Patriots soon deliver'd back the same, With sounds which jarr'd the elemental frame; To publish to the foe no power was lost, That death remain'd to swallow up their host. Drummond elated, to his aids around: âThe exploding shell has rent them from the ground! âBut lookâthey kindle with ambition fir'd! A part, it seems, are yet with life inspir'd. My fears alarm'd me that we'd grav'd the wholeâ That not a breathing body wrapp'd a soul. âExert your utmostâengines all explode, And hang upon the air a burning cloud! Swift runs the dial shade that brings your death! Quicken your thunders with a lightning breath! Stifle the element!âBrief, I decree Your final sceneâthe crush of Liberty! Time flies on cleaving wings to bring your fallâ The watch of twelve will toll your funeral! The sand is wasting when no more ye liveâ Wide yawns the grave your bodies to receive! The fowls of heavenââ Here, by his throat was sent A heated globe, which stopp'd his argument. Night holds its solemn reignâRound nature far, Through clouds thick broken, looks a green-ey'd star, The battle's buzz is heardâthe hoarse frog singsâ The bat eccentrick, flits on flickering wings. The owl, deep throated, hoots with boding screams, In hoarse complaint are heard the distant streams. The wild-cat screechesâwolves in chorus yell,â The cougar's voice alarms the ear of hell. Meteors of blood glare round the pall-black night, And through the darkness rain a dazzling light. The stars at length bring forth the signal hourâ Through the deep forest, Fisher leads his powerâ Beyond the voice, where Towson, Ripley, stand, He halts, and gives instructions to his band: âThe period hath arriv'd our arms to test; To seize and wrench the eagle from her nest. To scale yon battlements, inflame your wrath, And, for Niagara, their standards scath. âNicholls, proceed and break yon hosted men, That stand in wedge, the battery, lake, between. Rely upon the steelâthe flying lead They disregardâthe falchion strikes them dead. I on the bulwark shall the charge make good, Till every pike drinks plenteously of blood. âNowânowâ'tis nowâPlantâplant the climbers strong! Silentâtill vict'ry thunders from the tongue.â Forth rush the host to seize upon the prize, Fierce as mad whirlwinds tearing through the skies. The peerless Nichols in a reckless mood, Moves toward Ripley and the gallant Wood. And Fisher plunges headlong in his course To mount the battery with subduing force. The jealous Ripley waiting the alarm, Was first to harken to the moving swarmâ And like the shooting of an arrow, strode To where the planted infantry of Wood Were just in armour, scorning a surpriseâ Watching the darkness with unwinking eyes. He speaks the hero: âListen to the sound! Bend the locks ready for deliberate round! But soft!âstand dark without a moving breathâ Rolling they come!âEmit the blaze of death!â Death flashes at the word! The weapons pour Fire in full volleyâTowson's thunders roar, Troubling the elementsâA gush of blood Fattens the earth, from dying multitude. As when a band of lusty reapers wield Their crescent sickles in the harvest field, A thousand golden heads, at every blow, Sink with a shivering to the dust below: Thus fall the Albions, prone on every handâ But those with life roll backward o'er the land. By Fisher's daring, soon they re-uniteâ He gives them courage to renew the fight: âWho was the coward slave, that first said, Fly? Stand in your place! We mount the bulwark high! The column, change its front! Firm-lock'd, advance, Should heaven's blue lightnings in their anger glance!â Their manner they revers'd: In solid form, They move, and give the promise of a storm. Still as the midnight shades, Columbians stand, Lest they disturb the approaching of the bandâ They plant their ladders, confident of might, And mount them with their pikes! But, lo, their plight! Their length, scarce twice eight cubits, vain they strive To gain the parapet, twice ten and five! While thus in air a host of Britons stood, Fisher still urg'd the pressure of the crowd: âHandle your pikesâand beat their standard down! Snatch at the flag! Behold, the fort is won!â Scarce had these words found utterance from his tongue, When Ripley spoke, and forth the war-peals rung. In splinter'd parts the scaling-ladders flyâ On up-rais'd pikes the falling Britons die. With waste of life, they second time retireâ Slaughter pursues them on the wings of fire. But Fisher, still unconquerable, again Collects his scatter'd legions on the plain. âAnd shall we kneel in dust? renounce the prize? Shame at the thought! to death, or vengeance, rise! Hark! how they battle to the west and north? Listen! the thunders, how they spilt the earth! See, how the flashes kindle up to heaven? And are we kneelingâfrom our object driven? Shall Nott, shall Drummond, mount upon the wall, While we upon our knees for mercy call? Neverâno, neverâmagnify the deadâ And let each life-drop on the earth be shed. We'll storm, or die! Let none the column break, For now 'tis my design to ford the lake: Yesâround this bulwark, in the dark to wade, And charge upon them with a strength new made. The tumult at the north their mind will bend Back from the purpose, that we now intend; Yeaâwhile they think us driven to despair, We'll do such deeds as none but brave men dare. âOnâfollow where I lead!â He makes the stream, In which the bloody meteors flashing gleam, Prophetick of his death, if he proceed, While ghosts, with recent wounds, before him bleed! But them he disregards. His squadrons pour, Troubling the waters, like the ocean's roar. Soon Ripley kenn'd their movement in the floodâ And thus, half smiling in a pleasant mood: âBehold, the foe, which late with fire we slew! Like Egypt's gods, they've chang'd to something new! See with what foam they round the bulwark turnâ Kindle the matches! let the brass tubes burn! If spirits of the lake, they'll vanishâflyâ If not, perhaps a second time they'll die!â With flame in hand, brief at the order done, Towson and Wood exploded every gun. The Albions find o'erwhelming slaughter wide; Erie is thicken'd with a gory tide. A wound ends life; they faint and drink the lake, And never more from their oblivion wake. So vast the multitude, that sink below, Huge piles of dead above the waters show: Like islands rising in the neighbouring sea, Where Ãtna's burnings intercept the day. Fisher and Nicholls were the first that fell, For they were near, and entering with the steel. Well Ripley knew them by the badge they wore, And had them rais'd from out the lake of gore, That, when the storm should cease, with honours just, Solemn to shroud them in their robes of dust. Like broken billows tumbling to the shore, The Albions roll t' escape the iron shower, Vaulting with flame. A thousand with their breath Scatter like frenzy to avoid their death. But Ripley comes with steel upon their rear; Whole troops surrender, conquer'd by their fear. He leads them backâdelivers them to Wood, And joins with Hindman to maintain the feud. The time that Tucker with his host engag'd To beat back Towson with fierce passions edg'd, Not heard the tumult, let his column forth To storm the Douglas Battery at the north: But the bold youth his engines bent so well, Before their iron throats whole squadrons fell. Boughton, and Foster, Harding, Aspinwall, MacRee and Biddle, aided him with ball. The forward ranks stoop'd their tall heads to dust; The others fled, like snow before a gust; Or when a cloud, on Rocky-Mountains' height, Gathers with blackness like the folds of nightâ Rolling and deepening with a frown severe, Threatening the instant to dissolve the sphere. Behold, a tempest sweeps athwart the heaven; Sudden the darkness of its breast is riven! Its parts fly broken through the empty void, And all its terrour at a blow destroy'd: So broke the column breathless in their awe Before the tempest of the Douglas war. Drummond Col. Drummond. the meantime mov'd upon the fort, Deaf to the warning thunders in report Of Hindman's brazen mouths, which smote him dire, Yet still his breast he bore against the fire! As those in front with wounds unsightly bleed, An equal number crowded in their stead. As these sunk gasping on the slippery earth, Others successive pour'd their life's blood forthâ Still they advance, with desperation hot, And fix their ladders at the parapet! Drummond ascended, with ambition stung, And with this artifice he cloth'd his tongue: âSuppress th' explosion of the battery there! The Drummonds yield! they bend in their despair!â Douglas, the instant he the summons heard, Smiling obey'd the counterfeited word; So tender was his heart, he fear'd to wound A soul, whose flag had kiss'd the humble ground. By this, had Nott his broken ranks rejoin'd, And by his eloquence inflam'd their mind To storm the Douglas walls, whose smoke-wrapp'd fires Had chok'd the element. With mad desires They burnt to scale the battlementsâand Nott Fann'd high their ardour with his accents hot: âWhy stand we here, inactive as the moth, While Fisher, storming, overcomes the south? Hark! Drummond's in the fort! and here we stand! Grapple with earth! Convulsive grasp the brand! Behold, their brass have bellow'd them to rest! Move,âmount,âtransfix,âanatomy their breast! The night is ours! the fameâthe victoryâ The glorious fame of crushing Liberty!â Strong in their strength, they press in solid form, Forgetful of the late tremendous storm, Which buried half in blood! No dread they fear Of the damp death, which hovers on them near. To down with Freedom so absorbs their mind, All thoughts beside are scatter'd to the wind. While this was passing, Gaines fill'd every part, And, by his manner, plated every heart; Learning the cause why Douglas silent stood, While Nott was ready to dissolve his blood, Swift from the centre to the north he flew, And him he question'd with expressions few; âDouglas! why silent? say? wherefore, my son? Deceptious was the word! Flash every gun! Behold, the enemy, deep-lock'd in form, Approach unhurt, your proud defence to storm!â The youthful Douglas blushes for the past; He crowds his engines to augment the blast; With match-rope edg'd with fire, touches the prime; Thunders roll deafening,âlightnings flash sublime; The distant mountains echo back the roar; The column shriekâdrop deadâare heard no more! During these movements, Drummond reckless stood Amidst his dying host, besmear'd with blood, Determin'd in the fight! A hideous low'r Smother'd his brows by Hell's abiding power; Deep, thick, dark, blacker than the raven pall, Which wraps the coffin for the funeral. Grimly he stands, while hungry Death devours, Insatiate of his meal, his swarming powers, Grinding them bloody in his icy jaws; At length he foaming from the strife withdraws: Thus had a greedy wolf the sheepfold pass'd, But, ere a blood-drop had indulg'd his taste, The faithful mastiffs, in their courage strong, Drove back the ruffian from the bleating throng. Yet slow and sour he mov'd, grinding his teethâ Foam from his mad jaws gushing every breath: So Drummond rav'd, empurpled with his ire, To be compell'd from Hindman to retire. But soon his strength he gather'd on the plain, And brought them forward to the fight again. âBy all the untomb'd spectres of th night, Him death shall find who faulters in the fight! No Briton gives, should earth and heaven combine Earthquakes and thunders to retard the line!â So grating was his voice, like discord hell, It seem'd a fiend beneath had tun'd it well. Onward he moves, while blackening in his wrathâ His gloomy squadrons crowding on his path. While thus was DrummondâGaines with towering soul Plann'd, and directed, and inspir'd the whole; Bade Fanning's thunderers, Porter's volunteers, To point deliberate as he re-appears; And thus to Biddle with a gun's command: âRemove your brassâat your position stand, Ready with flame the slope to enfilade, That life may wither every blast that's made.â Rapid the word was given; he wheel'd away; Nor did the time admit of more delay. Silent in mind, Biddle the order done, While Gaines to Douglas in brief style begun: âYour deeds this night will never see the dark! But now in stillness their reserve you'll mark. Point with fatality! Listen!âno moreâ Hindman re-thunders on th' advancing power!â His voice was lost amid the peal of war, Which broke upon the heavens like earthquake jar. Hindman disgorges an o'erwhelming flame; Fanning, and Biddle, Porter, blaze the same; Ten thousand deaths leap forward at a flash; The skulls of Britons with a spattering crash. Drunken with carnage, back they reel againâ A groaning host lie gasping on the plain! But Drummond, still unconquer'd in his rage, Once more advanc'd his squadrons to engage; Once more the Patriots with destruction vast, In fiery whirlwinds smote them at a blast! The elder Drummond in his anguish stood To mark his brother thrice drove back in blood; He leaps to Tucker with reserve, and cries: âOn with your legions! seeâthe column dies! File with quick motionâlo, they melt away! Re-form the battle;âstand you to delay?â The sword of Tucker wav'd as he was done; He led his cohorts to the conflict on; Like clouds they come, when night is black with shades; But Douglas marks them,âkindles,âenfilades Their ranks, but partial seen, obscur'd by night Like distant fires, half smother'd from the sight. Thrice they recoil before the carnage dire; Thrice they press on till half their chiefs expire. While Douglas at reserve, the flames roll'd forth The smoke in volumes, by a light breeze north, Involves the bulwarks, like a cloud profound, Deepening, concealing, smothering up the ground, Shrouding the Britons, waiting for the prizeâ Veiling in darkness the Columbian eyes. Drummond perceiv'd, 'twas now his time to on; And thus with tyger confidence begun: âSee, the reserve approaches with support! Behold a coffin blackness wraps the fort! Move breathless to th' assault! Their cannon north Will drown our numerous feet in progress forth. Step light as snow-fallâplant the ladders, stillâ Then mount with bayonetsâmassacreing, kill.â They moveâthey reach the fortâthey plantâthey riseâ And thus the ruffian on the bastion cries: âStandâlock'd in wedge! No god shall drive us henceâ Not though that hell should rise in their defence! Roll in their blood! None from the sword shall live. Roll in their blood! We've mercy none to give!â âDamn the Yankeesâgive them no quarters!â Drummond. Ere this command the monster-man had said, The war burst horrid, starting up the dead! The Patriots pour a melting flood aroundâ Yet stand the Albions, and maintain the ground. Though by full hundreds in their death they fall, Hundreds ascend reckless of steel or ballâ The trench is chok'd! Blood gushes forth a streamâ And, as they yield their breaths, a thousand spirits scream! Till this, no balmy drop of Freedom's blood The earth had ever tastedânow it flow'd: Foremost in gallantry was young Fontaine: With vitals pierc'd, he fell among the slain. By Drummond's order, they his heart tore out, And whirl'd it tossing on their pikes about. And Williams, glowing with the blush of youth, Made rich with honour in the paths of truth, While toiling to exalt his country's fameâ Though scarce recover'd from a fever's flameâ Felt the cold steel within his tender breast; He sunk, a wreath of snow, and sigh'd his soul to rest: Thus some fair lily in the morning blooms, Gladdening the valley with its rich perfumes; The trembling dew-drops on its tresses weigh, And bend it stooping, lovely to survey: So pale upon his bosom sunk his head, Whilst direful rung the clashing armour dread. Lo, now, MacDonough, wounded in his side, With yielding voice to marble Drummond cried: âMy strength is failingâwasting is my lifeâ I ask protection to retire from strife.â âSpeak not of lifeâOf life I've none to give! None of the name of Liberty shall live!â The savage answer flam'd the hero's blood; Grasping a weapon in despairing mood, And, like a lion when incens'd with ire, He smote whole ranks, and caus'd them to retire. While thus his vengeance on the foe he dealt, Drummond sprang forward, snatching from his belt His ready arms,âquick bent the lock-spring,âfir'dâ MacDonough fell, but not his life expir'd; Beneath the bastion, in his gore he lies, Death hovering near to seal his slumbering eyes. Fast from his bosom ebbs away his life, Whilst o'er his head tumultuous roars the strife. Hindman beheld, and, with his soul as fire, Assail'd the tiger-man: âWretch! dieâexpire! Inhabitant of hell! flee earth!â he said, And opposite his breast elanc'd the lead; It reach'd his heartâbut lo! his heart of steel Batter'd the ball! By sword of Gaines he fell. The hero rushing cleft his skull in twain; He sunk with horrour, quivering on the slain, So rank his fester'd blood,âhis weight so dread, Groans seem'd to rise with shrieking from the dead! Behold! two ministers of hell appear To bear his soul to penal flames severe! Like struggling moons eclips'd, their eyes look dim, When mists of blood across their surface swim. A coil of snakes hard bind their temples round,â Their foaming tongues drop poison on the ground. Look, how they watch the heavings of his breath, His soul to seize the instant of his death! He shiversâgaspsâhe diesâ With horrour dread, See the fiends snatch the spirit of the dead! Like distant flames, they vanish from the eye, Dragging his soul to damn'd eternity! By this had Tucker come: âConquest!â he cries, And urges on the Britons to the prize. They stand determined on the bastion's brow, Though numbers fall, like autumn leaves, below. Gaines, Ripley, Porter, Hindman, Biddle, Wood, Strike at the heart, and empty it of blood. But where one dies, two enter in his room, Fix'd on their death, or Freedom to entomb. While thus they strove, MacDonough, where he lay Beneath the bastion, shelter'd from the fray, Beheld a chest of quick combustion nigh, And match, slow smouldering, to consume it, by: âI'll put it forth! O, how it mounts my soul! The foe unmerciful in flames shall roll! My fall shall not be vain. I'll break the strife, And, for my country, render up my life. âO Thou, who weighs the heavensâWho breath'd the mindâ Receive my spirit on the fiery wind!â His prayer was brief, but full. He flings the fireâ A thousand Britons at the blast expire! The blood-red meteors, flashing through the night, Turn pale and tremble at the hideous sight. The graves yawn wide, and let their tenants forthâ The shrouded spectres travel round the earth! CANTO XXXII SORTIE FROM FORT ERIE. ARGUMENT. Storin reinforces Drummond .... Games being wounded, retires to Buffaloe ..... Davis supports Ripley .... Address to Slavery ..... Brown, having recovered from his wounds, arrives at Erie ..... The Sortie. The scene is laid in, and about fort Erie. The time is ten days. Behold! what object burns upon the sight! It takes the fashion of triang'lar light; Like glow of melting iron the flame appears, Chaining the eye of mortals to the spheresâ What musick? Hark! transportingâhow divine! Is earth made heaven? is this the glorious sign? Celestial wonders marvellous unfold! From the empyrean, lo, a ring of gold Comes rolling down the stars, and meets the lightâ Wraps it in fireâpast utterance to recite! Their vital radiance animates the skyâ The stars of heaven break forth in harmony! The splendid wonder leaps from star to star, Till lost in glory from the sight afar! Spirit of Heaven! reveal this strange event, Beyond the reach of thought magnificent! I hear thy voice! how clear! how sweet, yet strong; I'm chain'd in silence, listening to thy tongue: âMacDonough's Spirit was the angular light, Which fill'd thy soul with wonder exquisite, Leaping the stars to seek its bless'd abodeâ The ring of fire, no less than breath of God! âPatriots like him, who for their country die, Are borne to Heaven on breath of Deity!â The night has pass'd away. The infant morn With tender beauty in the east is born. As night's thin shadows from her presence fly, Like innocence, her cheek glows blushingly. Drummond gives orders for the drums to call His scatter'd host, with feelings tragical: Slow they advance, and form in martial square, And thus he strives to keep them from despair: âNone hath his name dishonour'd in the fight; Away these thoughts, which sink us with their weight. Say that your ranks have bled at every vein, Is not my brother number'd with the slain? In peace, death winds insidious round the heart; In war, it comes,âand instant we depart: Yea, and remember'd on the page of timeâ A theme to melt to tears, or waken thoughts sublime. âWhat though profuse our royal blood was drain'd, Yet see what losses hath the free sustain'd: A fort in ruins cast upon the air. Hence, with light hearts, to Kingston we'll repair, And strengthen Prevost, Plattsburg to invade, And let division of the States be made. New Albion sever'd from the southern line, Will soon the standards of Britannia join. âSome tidings full of joy hath join'd our earâ Lo, Brown is dead, and ended his career! Fell in the conflict at Niagara's Height, Where we through scenes of fire maintain'd the fight, As Vincent's cohorts on their frontlets bear, Proving we held the palm of triumph there. âStrike the pavilionsâ âBut, behold, I see A herald straining up the lake for me! He comes to bring instructions from Prevost, That we should hasten to augment his hostâ âBut in due order through the camp divide, And banquet there, till I the march decide. Our blood, exhausted, will require to feast, Before we wave our standards to the east.â The cube the summons of the chief obey'd, While the shrill fife enlivening musick made. Their choicest viands sumptuous they provideâ Abundant now, such numerous mouths had died. Soon, by replenish'd goblets, they forego The sad effects of the disastrous blowâ They shout rejoicing for the fall of Brown, And thrice the number for their king and crown. Meantime, the messenger to Drummond came, An aid of StorinâAnson was his name. âMost royal Drummond!â thus with panting breath; âTerror of Europeâthe Columbians' death! My speed to thee has overleap'd the wind, To bear a message gladdening to your mind. My veteran chief with his command is nigh To plant to Cross on Vict'ry's summit high.â He scarce had said, when lo, an arrow's flight, Storin himself came forward from the right: âAnxious in person to salute your ear, I've follow'd swift upon my messenger, That I the circumstance minute might learn, Where are the foe my arms of fire should burn. âI strove my utmost to advance my power, During the night, to aid that awful hourâ The scene, at distance, as we hurrying came, Seem'd though the earth were kindled into flame. âWhen Prevost heard you at Niagara's Height, Orders he gave my march to expedite, Your arms to strengthen to o'erwhelm the fight.â âAnd does not Prevost need my army there? I thought that heâ âBut, officers, repair To my pavilion, where our luxuries waitâ While round the board on measures we'll debate.â Now when they'd made an ending of their feast, De Watteville, by Drummond honour'd least, Began the theme: âSustain'd by Storin's powerâ A veteran armyâin this trying hour, Never in thought would I indulge retreat, Till we the victory had made complete. âThough some may call the late assault our fame, Yet, should we march, I fear the English name Would darken with disgrace: Noâlet us first Sweep yon proud bulwarks level with the dust; With lines of complex art the fort surround, And enfilade and tear it to the ground.â Thus he. And Storin thus: âSure none will flee, While floats the Eagle on the lone winds free! Lo, twice five thousand on the field are mine, Ready to do what purpose we designâ Never appall'dâfrom battle never fled, Though oft their movements have been clogg'd with dead. None, that has blood to warm his heart, will give, Till from the foe submission we receive.â He ended. Drummond then: âWith pride I learn Your bosoms yet with daring impulse burn. âI thought, De Watteville, you understood, That never here we own ourselves subdu'd; Hence we, in every field, the conquest claim, By which, in foreign eyes, we hold our fame. âFrom long experience, happily I find, Defeat, or triumph, is belief of mindâ For I so frequent have the day made ours, Though from the battle driven were my powers, That I, as truth, my own reports believe, And thus, most soothingly, my mind deceiveâ This the advantage of a lofty tongueâ It keeps the head erect, though sad the heart be wrung. âNever to Europe would it answer there, Free our disasters open to declareâ 'Twould sink the dignity of Royal down, And dull the jewels of the English crownâ Then might, indeed, the Holy League suppose Our arms unequal with the free to close. âMy writings to the kingâmy speeches hence With acclamation of proud deeds commenceâ The notes of victory begin the strainâ And, in conclusion, is the host we've slain. âBut this, no more. With twice ten thousand strong, We soon in blood must stifle every tongue. Their strength, I learn, not equals one to four, Hence nothing saves them,âthough with desperate power They put their bosoms to the shafts of death, And seem to smile as they expire their breath. I find the thoughts, that Riall spoke, were right, That they resemble Michael in the fightâ Therefore should we another work design, By which to prove superior discipline. âYes, on the left extreme, bordering the lake, A new defence with cunning hands we'll make. Vincent, this labour I resign to thee, To enfilade and break an opening free. And you, De Watteville, with warriours bold, Will the redoubts upon the right wing hold. And, Storin, bravest where the valiant stand, Your part will be, the centre to command. âThose, not requir'd to execute the toil, Will with their flames the elements embroil, By which, perhaps, shall we effect a breach, Ere Vincent's mortars open from the beach. âThese views effected, we shall labour down Yon haughty ramparts, and exalt the crown.â His plans the different officers approve, And forth their squadrons to their place remove, To do the warfare as his orders bade, And cause the Stars before their strength to fade. Drummond join'd Vincentâled him to the lake To raise a mount the patriot walls to break. And, as they struck the margin of the beach, Drummond directed Vincent in a speech: âThis choice is mine, where presently you'll raise Bulwarks of strength upon the fort to blaze. Let the work show complexity of artâ Defended from assault in every part. Let lines intrenching, thrice six hundred feet, Be cut deep downward, till they arching meet. The pickets place in crowded circle roundâ Close setâand solid planted in the ground. Multiformâinvolv'dâa complex mazeâ Impossible to passâimmoveable to raze.â He ended. Vincent, with his engineers, Circles the work design'dâthe stout pioneers Approach with trenching implements and wound The bosom of the earth to raise the mound. Now Drummond strides with stateliness along, And bids the mortars' and the cannons' tongue Deafen with war. The engines bellowing sound Against the heroes in the forted ground: The brass of Storin from the centre burstâ Far on the right De Watteville the just, Generous, and valiant,âopens with a flame, Which in exploding shakes the welkin frame. Now when the glimmer of the morn was seen, The Patriots rose with brightness on their mien. They put their hands to toil, the wall to raise, Dash'd into ruins by MacDonough's blaze: So at the time that Hesper gilds the west, The weary bees on sugar beds at rest, A swain approaches with his Indian fumes, And drives them sicken'd from their lodging roomsâ Rifles their hive of its melliferous sweets, And then with whistling to his home retreatsâ The bees awaken unsubdu'd, at mornâ The every fibre of their strength new bornâ Burning with diligenceâunited zealâ And patriot ardour for the publick wealâ Their broken dwelling rapidly repair, Each animating each with cheerful air: Thus the Columbians like the zealous bee, Restore the breach which broke the enemy. Gaines, by his knowledge of a leader's part, Keeps an excitement in each soldier's heartâ Giving to those who in their toils excel, The approbating smile of doing wellâ And yet his praise he tempers as to heat, The blood of those less willing of their sweat. Thus were the free employ'd, when Drummond's band Began at distance to inflame the land. Gaines, at th' explosion of the fiery swell, Spoke to his cannon for their globes to tell: âSilent no longer with the matches standâ Advance them to the vents with rapid hand! Hindman, scarce equall'd in the hour of flameâ And Towson,âlasting as creation's frame, Involve the day in darkness deep as nightâ With globes impetuous driven, their labours smite; But watch the sky-shells as they arching fall, Or when the guards shall give th' alarming call.â Forth to the vents the brave the matches plyâ Red balls of thunder split along the sky. From fort, from breast-mounds, dire the lightnings playâ A fiery darkness muffles up the day. Gaines, now exhausted with excess of cares, To rest faint nature, to his couch repairs. Scarce was he seated by himself alone, When a bomb hissing, from the Albions thrown, Rush'd in his presence! Flying from his seatâ The shell explodes tremendous at his feet! The thick, convolving, suffocating smoke, And nitrous flames, his life with smothering choke. His burning wounds confine him to the floorâ But Ripley comes and dashes at the doorâ The wounded in his arms he bears awayâ The breath of morning brings him back to dayâ His feeble voice scarce audible is heard: âMy war is doneâand useless is my sword. Now must thy soul stand forward in the strifeâ I know thy honour is more dear than life. To you the conquering Brown will soon be givenâ His wounds seem healing by the hand of heaven.â This effort, partial made him swoon awayâ Ripley to Jones: âSmooth o'er the lake convey The fainting warriorâland at Buffaloe, Where healing hands their unction will bestow. âTill Erie's wave shall moulder on the tongue, His valiant deeds in triumph will be sung.â Jones, with emotions which bespeak the brave, With tender touch conducts him o'er the wave. Th' opposing powers for nine continu'd days, Involve the compass of the field in blaze. Conflicting flashes burn along the ground, While smiting thunders mix with direful sound. Thus when deep earthquakes startle from beneath, Bursting their ribs of rock with sulphur breath, While the sun darken'd in eclipse is seen Behind the moon, portending death to men. Like this the element is fill'd with warâ The sun and planets darken and withdraw. Thus they incessant toil'd days five and three, And unexhausted was their enmity. But on the ninth, the Vincent battery done, Hush'd into silence was their every gun. Now Davis, with his cohorts reach'd the fort, And of his strength to Ripley made reportâ York's gallant sonsâno slaves her fallows till, But freeborn hands her horn of plenty fillâ Slavery! thou nurse of bitterness and woâ Thou rankest poison of this earth below! Behold yon breathing formâthe seat of pride, Whose craving wants by thee are satisfiedâ Neverâahâno:âthy sweat but feeds his fires, And desolates his soul with hell desiresâ Passion is reasonâall his grovelling mind Wallows in mireâto swinish lusts resign'd. Fractious,âcapricious,ânow with anger wildâ Now foolish fond,âa rattle for a child. His time is nothingness:âfar worse than dead, See how he tosses, listless on his bed! While Nature blushes with luxuriant charms, Heâhe aloneâis dead in sleep's dull armsâ Markâhow he gnashes in a raving mood, Wildly he starts!âhe dreams of Africk blood! The vision wakes him:âYawningâfeverish nowâ Vacant his eyeâdejection damps his brow. His nerves are loose,âunstrung,âinactive,âweak, He feels it labour or to breathe or speak. He cradles as he movesâbut yet, remains His strength of arm, supplied with burning veinsâ By frequent use its brawny muscles swell, Plying with straining eye the lash of hell! Who is this being to the sight address'dâ A moth in actionâbut of tyger breast! 'Tis a poor lordlingâmiserably poor, Worse than a beggar fed from door to door. Now turn thine eye and mark that object there! His jetty limbs uncover'd from the air! Ah, see him cast his leaden eye around, As dull he heavy moves slow-moping o'er the ground. He marks creation bright with freedom glow, And hears the notes of woodland musick flowâ He sees their liberty and sighs more deepâ His heart is brokenâsad, behold him weep! List to his clanging chain! it chills the heart! From father, wife,âfrom children see him part! Lo, while he stays to take a farewell look, His feet are hasten'dâHark!âthe iron stroke!â He bleeds!!â The theme no more!âMy heart sinks deadâ A frenzied wildness startles through my head! Perhaps this slave in chainsâah, who can tell, But that his soul would made a Hannibal! And are his looks and Africk-colour'd skin, The damning marks to gratify thy sin! Because of these,âthou rocky Tyrant!âsay, Dost thou snatch Freedom from his soul away? Blush, Monster! blush!âI talk to ears of stoneâ A blush ne'er mantled o'er thy cheekânot one! Tremble!âJustice Eternal marks within The spotted heartâbut not the jetty skin! Plead'st thou the right because thou hast the power? If power give rightâO think of Judgment hour! Then, for thy cruelties wilt thou atoneâ Fiends, fiends will seize and grind thy heart of stone! Slavery! thou art most pois'nous, loathsome baneâ Thou stain'st my country with the blackest stain. Cursedâpast cursed, be that cursed hour, When Africk's children landed on our shoreâ Let that death-day be stricken from the yearsâ Heaven! be eclips'd, and weep down bloody tears! The Muse hath led me from my theme awayâ Trembling I feel the passion of her lay: But when the fountains of my soul are dry, I then again the war-song note will try. With heart new-sinew'd, lo, the warrior Brown Returnsâto reach the summit of renownâ Enters the fort:âthe mouth of every sore Heal'd as though touch'd by some superior power. Arriv'dâand friendship's salutations done, Ripley the business of the war begun: âThy presence glads our hearts! The nine past days, We've dash'd against the foe a sheeted blaze, Yet in defiance, yonder bulwark they Completed, ready on the fort to play. As morning's harbinger made bright the east, Tir'd, by parts their cannonade they ceas'd. By certain movements late, I apprehend, Soon they their utmost on our walls will bend. âA happy fortune gives thee to us nowâ A saddening gloom is clouding every brow.â Brown stood in silence with a pondering look Weighing his thoughtsâat length his purpose broke: âOne passage only opens to be free, And that is thisâto strike them in sortie. This plan is allâthe only that remainsâ To clothe with steel and meet them on the plains. To men less brave, it desperate would appearâ But well I've tested what of souls are here. âRiddle, and Frazierâyouths of passing worth, From southern angle of the works move forth. A path make clear with secrecy and haste, Through the thick beeches, where their right is plac'd. Be mindful to return in silence soonâ We strike the blow when sun shall pass high noon. âWood, Gibson, Davis, your divisions join, To move with Porter in the bold design. When Riddle, Frazier, shall the way complete, They'll be your guides the enemy to meet. Miller, your cohorts, in yon deep ravine, Keep dark from sight,âno flag, or steel-point seen, Till to their left shall Porter's lines advanceâ Then, with slant bayonets on their centre glance. Trimble, and Aspinwall, his cares divide, For oft your bosoms have with death been tried. Forsythe, and Upham, stand with Ripley, here Reserv'dâto move where pressure shall appear. âLet each prepare to fill his part assign'dâ Let inspiration burn upon the mind.â Riddle, and Frazier, ere the chief was done, Had pass'd the fortress and the path begun. The others to their different lines withdrew To rank them off, and give them feelings new. Soon stood the columns in their steel prepar'd, To hear the word and do the thing they dar'd. At length, the gold-hoof'd coursers of the sun, Climbing the heavens had half their circuit runâ They there a moment stood to breathe and rest, Ere they their flight precipitated west. Riddle and Frazier to the fort return'd, And Brown their doings of the former learn'd: âTh' important office you to us conferr'd, Is doneâso secret, scarce a leaf was stirr'dâ Yesâwe so circumspect our course pursu'd, Britannia dreams not of the path of blood. The wayâwithin ten footsteps of their right, Nothing impedesâyet blinded from their sight.â Thus Riddle, modest. Brief the words of Brown: âYour names will dwell, young warriors, in renown. Wide through the land your characters are spread, You'll Porter guide within the route you've made.â With willing feet to Porter they repair, While Brown advanc'd and occupied the square, Where stood the Patriots, rank'd in martial form, Waiting the word, the enemy to storm: âArriv'd at length hath the decisive hour, Which breaks in fragments the Britannick power. Now is it offer'd to the soul, who dares To place his name with those immortal heirsâ Dwellers in heaven!âwhose praise till end of years, Will form sweet musick to the listening spheres. âHow often have you met this foe the sameâ Sunder'd his ranksâhis standards scorch'd with flame: At York he fled, pursu'd with whirlwind breath, Mingled with fireâa universe of death. And as was Sheffie,âbeaten was Prevostâ He fled the harbour with a shiver'd host. And at the fortress of the rock-ribb'd George. Scath'd was the enemy with lightning chargeâ At plains of Chippewa, the Eagle tower'd, While crouching in the dust the Lion cower'd. Late, at Niagaraâthe Height of Fame! He fell,âand fear'd to think upon your name! Yea, at these bulwarks curtain'd in the night, Ye melted down to death his banded mightâ Crowded grim Darkness with his shrieking dead! And roll'd him back in fiery carnage dread! âAnd will ye shrink at this momentous hour? Resign your fame and crouch beneath his power? Resign to him, whom frequent you've subdu'd, And made the earth reel drunken with his blood? Resign to him your verdant laurels won? Resign and sue that your free drops may run? âLonger not here can we with life remainâ No choice but yield, or meet them on the plain. Lo, yonder mound is ready at the beach! To enfilade us and effect a breach! âSay, which your choice? to bleed, to fight, or fly? I pause to learn your willâ. âWar sparkles every eye! It glads my heartâa sacredness, like heaven, Thrills every nerve to see you valiant given! âHeed not the sting of death! to die is gain! How rich the boon to fall in glory slain! An immortality proclaims his worth, Who dies in battle for his native earth! âMove in deep silence forth! The motto bright, Is God, and Liberty, and Freedom's Right.â As when in summer's drought refreshing showers Restore the fragrance of the drooping flowersâ Or when that spicy gales delicious rise On playful pinions from the southern skies, Quickening the plants and all created things, By winnowing odours from their dewy wings: So words of Brown inspirited with lifeâ And every breast was throbbing for the strife. They move with solemn stillness at commandâ Riddle and Frazier guiding Porter's band. Miller advances to the deep ravine, The Albion centre and the fort between. Ripley and Upham, ready at the gate, Standâat a signal to precipitate. Nothing of these events did Albion dreamâ But at the battery on the left extreme, Drummond, intent, applies his energies To plant his guns to smite his enemies. He boasts of sudden triumph: âNow full soon, We'll cast their banners to the waning moon! When day returning lights the gate of heaven, With battering globes their bulwarks shall be riven. Yon starry ensign floating in the breeze, Will lap the dustâswift death their hearts shall seize. Then, retribution for the blood we've lost!â None shall have life lest haughty he should boast Of victory, as heretofore they've doneâ E'en at Niagara, where our bayonets won!â While Drummond thus was lifted in his mind, As though the free were in their graves inshrin'd, Porter's division charg'd upon his right, Cold with the steel and put the wing to flight! So wolves compell'd reluctant from their prey, By mountain panthers in the midnight fray, Retire morose and sour o'er barren heathâ Enter their den and plan new scenes of deathâ While unsuspecting, they their theme pursue, Their late opponents rush upon their viewâ At first in their surprise resign'd they die, Without an effort, or to fight, or flyâ But soon the leader of the wolves inspires His panick host to wake their wonted firesâ Blood streams for bloodâteeth grinding gnash on teethâ Promiscuous slaughter shrouds the cave of death: Thus Porter without notice drove the steelâ With hearts transfix'd, full many a Briton fellâ But at DeWatteville's command they stand, And wield their arms against the patriot band. Bayonet on bayonet drove makes waste of lifeâ And sweat and blood are mingled in the strife. The Albions sink upon the earth in filesâ Gales, Chandler, Kimbly, Ethelwood, and Milesâ Leaders of rankâtheir thread of life in twain, Roll their sad eyes convulsive with the slain. A lead strikes Gibson 'neath his dexter eye, In act to wrench their standard from the skyâ Down sinks the warrior to mortality. His life a moment lingers in his breastâ But soon his eyes are slumber'd in their rest. Another pours his sacrificing bloodâ Cold on the earth expires the gallant Wood. Deep through his vitals was the steel-point droveâ A sigh transplants him in the soil above. Like rising stars illustriously they shoneâ But ah, how sudden is the radiance gone! Their starry splendour by the clouds of death, Is dark extinguish'd on the carnage heathâ Not so!âtheir deeds defy the graveâthey shineâ Brightening in heavenâtheir memories live divine! Porter leaps forward with his flaming brand: âMount, mount the bulwarkâmeet them sword in hand! Plunge, plunge the steelâwhat signifies the ballâ Charge, every soulâcharge, each, and one and all!â As flame is kindled by the mountain wind, So blazes out at full the fire-wrapp'd mind. They mount the parapetâa ridge of steel, Before whose edge the ranks of Britons reel. But firm, DeWatteville, with fiery blade, Maintain'd the groundâhis faultering legions stay'd. âAnd is there none to fight? Albions, return! Let steel clash steelâlet withering lightnings burn! Fire boil your blood! Transfix the seat of lifeâ Let pale mortality o'erwhelm the strife!â The royals standâimmoveableâa rock, And every effort of the Patriots mock. Dust mix'd with reddening blaze the field obscuresâ A cloud of darkness round about them lowers,â Porter in front, half bath'd in blood is seen, Guiding the violence, which mads his men. DeWatteville is partial hid in flamesâ They rush together like two fiery streams, High wield their falchions! Parried from its course, The Albion's swordâdestruction in its force, Sunders the muscles of the patriot's thighâ But Porter, reckless with a searching eye, Strikes to the hilt his weapon through his teethâ The red steel smoking gleams his jaw beneathâ No groan is utter'd by DeWattevilleâ Valiant he yields his lifeâsubdu'd, his warriors quail. Porter while bleeding, thus to Davis speaksâ For not his wound his soul's devotion checks: âWarrior! thy column to the centre onâ And strengthen Miller in the fight begun! Here will I restâindulge my soul's desire, To mark your standard as it waves in fire!â Without rejoining, Davis when he spoke, Wheel'd to aid Miller, dimly seen in smoke. Now when that Porter on the right began The furious onsetâman oppos'd to manâ Miller, as sudden from his ambush proud, Roll'd to the battle like a whirlwind loudâ But Storin stood immoveableâa tower,â And foil'd in part the rushing of his power: As two dark clouds of thunder meet in heaven, With fire of lightning round the welkin drivenâ Scorching the elements along their pathâ Troubling the earthâconvulsing it with wrath: With equal violence the combat rag'd, When Miller's strength and Storin's fierce engag'd. But Davis comesâweds Miller in the strife, Whose scimetar strikes Storin through his life. Again the Lion crouches to the earthâ Again the Eagle glories in her birth! But Davisâmark him in the dust full low! Life's fountains brokenâfrom his mouth they flow, Frothing from his lungs! Soundâsound is the sleepâ The sleep of death!âhis bosom friend must weep, And children drop a tearâthough thus to die, Embalms his name with names in heaven on high! Miller paus'd not: âWarriors! one effort more Remainsât' assail their bulwark at the shoreâ Subdue the last of Drummonds with the bladeâ The blush of his vitality shall fade! I'll try sir! is the word! the word will bear To break a passage through yon fastenings there!â Immediately the brave their columns form, And move in silence like a brewing storm. Now during these assaults, Brown jealous kenn'd Each passing movementâview'd their standards bend; But when of Miller, he his purpose saw, On the lake battery to advance the war, He spurr'd to Ripleyâutter'd these commands: âHasteâsupport Miller with your flinty bands. Now is the dubious point. With effort bold, We war with Drummond in his strongest hold.â The daring Ripley with a tightening nerve, Bracing his heart, leads forward the reserve. He joins with Miller, moving o'er field To do such deeds as never were excell'd. The meantime Drummond kept his vision bent, When Porter rush'dâto mark each dire event. The time he saw his proudest troops expire, His soul seem'd tossing in a sea of fire. But now, that Miller on his bulwark turnsâ He breathes disorder'dâevery blood-vein burnsâ With monster lungs and tyger voice he cries, While drops of oozing gore distain his eyes: âWhatâdare they in this way to enter here? In every bosom will we plant a spear! Let them approachâin clouds of fire approachâ Never they here upon our flag encroach! They come like flocks to meet their sacrificeâ By all the unseen people of the skies, I shrink not back! Let men with dÃ¦mons join, To urge a pass, our banners to resign, Here will we stand with battlements secur'd, And search their hidden natures with the sword! âBehold, they come! Wash with their blood the earthâ Let deeds of slaughter constitute our mirth!â Scarce the last echo of his voice was done, When lo, at Miller was the war begun. Each hurrying moment made it grow more wild, Whilst hungry death look'd on and grimly smil'd. In vain the patriots strove the works to passâ Numerous they fell as mowers sweep the grass. O'Fling, and Blakesley, die in their renownâ Armistead of tender yearsâBuel, Belknap, Brown, Son of the general's brotherâBradford, Hall, Are wrapp'd in gory shroudsâa warrior's pall! While thus the conflict stood, Riddle was seen To pass the rear to light the magazineâ At Yorkâand at the fort of George, before, He'd learnt the art. Intent to hear it roar, He spreads a hasty trainâthe quick-fire plies, And with a darting from the danger hiesâ Th' exciting flash runs flickering o'er the groundâ The chamber'd dust explodes, convulsing heaven profound. Instant the Patriots heard the mine explode, High beat their hearts with stimulating blood. Ripley beheld the kindling of his band, And while his falchion lighten'd in his hand, Pour'd forth his voice: âWith cords and axes keen, Downâdown the fastenings! let the foe be seen! Heed not the flames tempestuous from above, But like the spirits of immortals move! Leapâleap the ramparts!âclimb the breasted earth! Let none recede and bastardize his birth!â His language lost them earthâthey felt as heaven Had touch'd their ears!âand forth a breach was riven! Trench after trench with rapidness they bound, And rush the bulwark with triumphant sound: As when the ice in Susquehannah breaks, The time the gladdening spring with beauty streaks The northern heavenâa thousand streamlets pour Their tributary waves with clamorous roarâ As down o'er rocky cataracts they boundâ The neighbouring forests echo back the sound. Betwixt two mountain spurs the ice at length, Impacted locks the river in its strength. Behind the mound the waters congregate, Pressing a passage with o'erwhelming weightâ At last, the frictive waves wear thin the flakesâ The barrier stirsâit bendsâit groansâit breaks! The crash tremendous though the earth were rent, Deafensâlike falling of the element: Thus dire the Patriots rush'dâbroke down the woodâ Enter'd and drew retaliating blood. Vincent expiresâand five time twenty more Of Albion leadersâstruggle in their gore. Of wounds immortalizing, freemen fallâ Trimble the brave, and Brook, and Aspinwall.â Ripley with Drummond thrusting, deep receives A wound from those his guardâbut yet he livesâ The secret lead pass'd burning through his neck, And glanc'd his arm rais'd on the foe to breakâ Kirby his aid conveys him from the fieldâ Still swells the tumultânone pretends to yield! The daring Forsythe is a quenchless fireâ Not small the names before his steel expire. But lo, a bullet scorches through his frameâ How soon extinguish'd is the vital flame! Loud shout the Albions to behold his blood, And compass Miller with a fiery flood! While thus the battle hangsâthe conquering Brown Comes bounding, maddening, dashing, thundering onâ His sword corruscates with an angry light, Like a red meteor streaming through the night. His soul enkindles burning as he flies, While death's dark glance comes blasting from his eyes. His falchion streaming fire at every blow, Subdues whole filesâthey choke in blood below. Scarce seems he mortal in his lifeâso great His deeds appearâHell-Drummond meets his fate! The trembling Albions scatter o'er the heathâ Yet Brown pursues them on the wing of death, Fix'd in his purpose to consume the wholeâ But lo, a voice celestial calms his soul: âJustice is satisfied! No longer scath Their withering life! Let mercy stay thy wrath!â Fredonia ended. Brown obey'd the word, And in its place return'd his reeking sword. Thus, when by storms the ocean heaves to heaven, By which the battlements of earth are rivenâ The Power that rules the tempest bids it cease, And lo, at once its turbulence is peace: So when Fredonia gave the signal word, Brown calm'd his soul and sheath'd his slaughtering sword. CANTO XXXIII. CRUISE OF CAPTAIN BLAKELEY. ARGUMENT. Prevost removes from Kingston to Montreal .... Blakeley puts to sea in the Wasp .... Capture of the Reindeer .... The Wasp after the blowing up of her Prize, enters the port of L'Orient to refit .... Revisits the ocean .... Sinks the Avon .... Capture of the Atalanta .... The Shipwreck. The principal part of the scene is laid on the Atlantick Ocean .... The time is one hundred and forty two daysâcommencing in October and ending in March. While Drummond strove with Erieâto enthral The state of York, Prevost to Montreal From Kingston led his troops with streamers gay, To be prepar'd th' invasion to essay, When Drummond should return with conquer'd Brown, Green with his laurels to adorn the Crown: But when he learnt the truth of the reverseâ That both the Drummonds slept upon their hearse, His pride was shipwreck'd 'gainst the rock despair, Which quell'd his passion for invading there, Till from the Albion Island, should be sent, In proud array a regal armament. Summer hath fledâand all her robes of green, That dress'd the groves, have vanish'd from the scene. The boughs no longer dance to hear the song, That warbled sweet the listening woods among. The sun obliquely from the Scorpion shines, And all the beauty of the past declinesâ Chill, blustering Autumn powders white the earthâ Gray squally clouds scud broken from the north. Now the keen Wasp in novel beauty dress'd, At Portsmouth sets upon the wave at rest, Ready to loose her pinions on the air, When the mild Blakeley should the word declare. This is thy child,âO take him to thy breast! Yes, he is thine, Green Island of the West! Erin! 'twas thou his infant being gaveâ But thy oppressors drove him o'er the wave. Columbia nurs'd him in his infancy, That he in manhood might with spirit free, Seek retribution of that cruel hand, That smote his father from his native land. Erin! the poet sighs to mark the chain Which cramps thy bosom, till it bleeds with painâ May future Blakeleysâfuture Emmetts rise, And proud restore thine ancient liberties! At Chapel Hill, the Muses' hallow'd seat, Fair Science taught him how to guide the fleetâ Or by the sun self-balanc'd at his heightâ Or by the star that shines with changeless light. With him to rule, are Barry, Tillinghastâ Whose knowledge of the ocean none surpass'dâ And Riely, Langdon, Toscan, Geinsingen, Young in their years but ripe for deeds of men. Now as the dappled east preludes the sun, Thus to his crew the mariner begun: âYe sons of ocean! born with valour true, The time is now our glory to pursueâ Listed for Freedom, all, our all forsakeâ The tyrant's chain upon the ocean break. Yesâloud our Country calls us to the sea, That of the foe we seek indemnity From injuries committed on the main, Which bleeds the heart and maddens in the brain. Our brothers starv'd in chains, or scourg'd till blood Ooz'd from their flesh and trickled in the flood! âHeavens! how sublime,âhow righteous is the cause! Our rights, our libertiesâprimeval laws, Cry JusticeâVengeance 'gainst the Albion nameâ And wing us forth to do the deeds of fame. Yeaâevery throbbing of your heart I feelâ It beats for retribution, or to seal With its best drops the freedom of the waveâ We conquer there, or in it find a grave! Where duty calls, there man should ever be, And leave the issue with the Deityâ 'Tis not for us the future hour to scanâ To act with honour is the sphere of man. âLoosen the anchor, and the sheets display, And dash the vessel through the watery way:â That gales to us propitious may be given, Humble we'll trust the guardianship of heaven.â Slow turns the fluke with labour from the sand, While anxious thousands gaze upon the strandâ As swings the vessel with a sideling turn, The mariners collected on the stern, Shout to their brothers on the beach, farewell! Which bears a solemn sweetness in its swell. The peopled shores the parting shout return, With eyes that show their souls' affections yearn, Back come the farewell echo to the crewâ The shores reply their lastâtheir long adieu, Which the receding vessel answers loud, Then waves farewell! The sea-boys climb the shroud, And spread the Wasp's white wings upon the breeze, That gently curls the bosom of the seas. A solemn musick through the azure floats, As though an angel measur'd out the notes;â Far more exquisite than Ã¦olian lays, When kissing zephyr on the silver playsâ More sweet than this the deities of heaven, Hymn to the vesselâto the ocean given. While curtain'd in a cloud the musick sings, Smooth glides the ship upon expanding wingsâ But soon her every pinion looming forth, She shows like beauty to the eye of earth. While thus serene she moves,âa long pent sigh Breathes from the shore to heaven's dread Sovereignty, Vouchsafe to crown their mariner with light, And then return him to their joyous sight: But half their supplication reach'd His ear, The rest was scatter'd in the vacant sphere. Blakeley will have his fameâbut never more, With mortal vision see Columbia's shore, But in the sequel will a scene be shown, Which to his country will his loss atone. Lo, now the Wasp more large the air inhales, And cleaves the ocean with expansive sails: So when an eagle, to produce her young, Bosoms her eggsânor thinks the period longâ But when her offspring are produc'd at large, She prunes her wings to feed her tender chargeâ At first, with effort hard, tardy she moves With heavy motion, labouring through the grovesâ At length she clears the thick, obstructing trees, And meets serene in heaven th' inspiring breezeâ With joy she claps her wings and buoyant sails Sublime aloft before the winged gales: Not otherwise the Wasp, on ocean's breast, Flies like the eagle from her callow nest. Her native hills in azure mist recede, Slow sinking on the sightâthe wind her speedâ A flame ethereal animates her crew, As earth retires and firmamental blue, And ocean's wide immeasurable round, Exalt th' affections of the soul profound. Blakeley commandsâand south by east they sail, Shifting the canvass with the shifting galeâ And while the vessel as with instinct flies, They ken the waste to mark their enemies: A hunter thus o'er Laurel Mountain roves In quest of game, that graze or bound the groves. This way and that he bends his listening ear, With mouth half open, distant sounds to hearâ His eye quick glancing at each passing shade, Jealous they leap unseen along the glade: Thus like the hunter as they plough the main, To spy the foe, their nerves of vision strain. For days twice three and two no flag appearsâ And north by east the bounding vessel veersâ But when eight glasses on this compass driven, Prizes surrender till they count to seven. Now Blakeley to the north directs his viewsâ True to the pole the Wasp her course pursuesâ When plough'd the sea twice fifteen five and one, As from his bed of waves arose the sun, âA sail on weather beam!ââa ship-boy criedâ Obscure through distance, on the ocean spiedâ âA sail! a sail!ââresounded through the ship, As on she darted in a flying sweep. Blakeley commanded: â'Vast! the helm alee! Tack round the ship! The fore and gib-sheets free! She bears the sign of war upon her deckâ We'll give her chace, her flight to overtake. Wide stretch the canvassâdart along the floodâ Enchafe your hearts with stimulating blood.â The Wasp veer'd round upon the azure seas, While loose the canvass shiver'd in the breeze. Rustling it fillsâthe vessel feels the force, But drags with labour sluggish in her course,â New bent, each moment she augments her wayâ She leaps, she flies, she bounds along the sea. The royal battle-ship, Reindeer by name, Is rul'd by Manners worthy of the fameâ O what a feast, how grateful to my mind, A generous foe upon the wave to findâ It sheds around me a peculiar charm, Touching my bosom with sensations warm: So while in journeying from my place of birth, Boston,âthe loveliest city of the earthâ To where the buffaloe and mammoth trodâ Kentuckyânow man's civiliz'd abode:â Travellers uncouth o'ertook me on the way, Who by their rudeness lengthen'd out the dayâ But soon we parted on a several roadâ My heart reliev'd, with new sensations glow'd. Not long I wore the path, when lo, I met The Poet Percival, sublime and sweetâ With words of musick we his village won, Nor felt the languor of the melting sun: With equal joy I meet with Manners now, Touching the heart like musick's tender flow. Intent he kenn'd the anger'd Wasp afar, Her weight deceiv'd him: âBooming from afar, Behold the Constitution rul'd by Hull! Cleaveâleap the oceanâspread the canvass full!â With every pinion rais'd the Albion flewâ But Blakeley near'd him on the dark wave blueâ Th' impetuous labours of the foe are vainâ No ship outsails him on the tossing main. Soon Manners judg'd the Wasp of equal forceâ And with a blush he check'd his flying courseâ Indignant thus: âFor hours twice four and one, A path disgraceful through the deep we've run! High on the fore the White and Blue displayâ With deeds of brightness wipe the stain away! The Royal Pennant and the Ensign show! Braceâbrace the fibres for the battle now! âAnd is the prowess of Britannia gone? Are all her triumphs on the ocean done? I thought the foe twice fifteen ten and fourâ But lo, her weight is but of equal power! Blush at the run! Britain has seen the day, A ship like ours would glad have sought the fray With twice its balanc'd strengthâHer spirit breaks! Where now her Duncans, Jarvis, and her Blakes? And does her valour sleep in Nelson's grave? Is he the last of all our seamen brave? At Cape Trafalgar was our glory done, And was his death the setting of our sun? And neverânever will our fame return? Yesâlift our souls, and let our hearts' blood burn! His spirit will return! I feel the flame Burn at my heart to match our ancient fame! Each on his knee make oath to never kneelâ Die firstâand with our blood our valour seal! Ere stoops our flag we'll sink in glory's bedâ Eternal honours crown the valiant dead! âDown on the enemy the vessel runâ At thirty fathom blaze the shifting gun. High on the mizzen gaff the Lion showâ We fight, we conquer, or we sink below!â His kindled passion lit their breast with fireâ They riseâand as they rise they feel desire, By lofty bearing to efface the stainâ Disgraceful scudding o'er the rolling main. On mizzen gaff the Lion mad is seen, And then the Pennant, in the sky sereneâ The foe defying, waves the Cross in sightâ Thus in her robes she comes to wage the fight. What time she mov'd obliquely with the wind, Six mariners impress'dâwith broken mind, Advanc'd to Manners with affecting mienâ Marr, Russell, Gleason, Woodfall, Paulding, Keeneâ A righteous cause gave boldness to their breastâ And Marr, the subject of their grief express'd: âPride of the royal banner! known to thee, Is our Impressment on the open sea, From the ship Commerce by the Montagueâ Ten years and past we've serv'd with Albion's crew! âBehold yon flag of Stars of brilliance brightâ We plead th' indulgence to avoid the fight. Let us below. Our blood congeals with awe To raise our hands against our friends in war. We give thee gratitude for favours pastâ But now we plead to shun th' approaching blast. Think of our wrongful bondage on the flood, And thou wilt free us from our brothers' blood!â Manners gave answer: âOften have I bled, Deep at my heart to see you captive made. Impressment, whatâI blush to name the thingâ Its very thought is like a serpent's sting. A monster hatch'd in hell! It brings disgrace On prince and subject of the Albion race. The greatest plea that ever I could find, Was that we fought the battles of mankind. âI grant your will. It never shall be said, That I unworthy had perform'd a deed, The thought of which, coagulates my bloodâ 'Gainst law, 'gainst justice,âboth of man and God! Yesâpass belowâfor I your souls approveâ That man's a wretch who feels no patriot love.â Th' Impress'd, half weeping, thank him with a breast Weighted with that that never was express'd: They pray for Blakeleyâbut their generous foe Weakens their orisons as they pass below. The meantime Blakeley gain'd upon the chaceâ He gave command with a peculiar grace; âOut, out the stud-sails!âwind begins to failâ Our gallant ship will bear increase of sail. Employ the engineâmake the canvass moistâ And high in heaven the Star-crown Eagle hoist! âThe foe wears round! The outward sails take in! Be ready, lads, the battle to begin. Explode a windward gun to let him know, Our ship is ready to exchange the blow. âBehold, our brass he answers in reply! He veersâhe comes offensive on us nigh! Reef, reef the stay-sails and the royals furl! Let fire the matches light, the globes to hurl. Words are but vapourâMark, we win or dieâ There comes the foe, and here our thunders lie!â His accents burnt with fire. Each with a breast, Thrill'd with his spirit, answer'd his behest. To die or conquer was the favourite word Of youth, of manhoodâevery heart on board. The English vessel wore while this was doneâ And now she opens with her charging gun. Blakeley endeavours with a skilful mind, Triangling on the deep to gain the wind. But Manners, artful keeps his vessel trim, Intent to wound his sails and cripple him, While not the Wasp a gun can bring to bear, So far oblique her foe avoids to square. But when his fourth explosion flam'd the sea, Which scarce to Blakeley was an injury, Backward he cast the motive from his mind, Longer to wait th' advantage of the wind: âAlee the helm! The foe place on the beam! Aft cannonades on starboard battery stream! Let pointed flames upon the vessel bear, And make her feel the promise of despair!â They touch'd the match-fire ere his voice was done, And forth the battle in its rage begun: Two shapes of serpent form, in northern flood, Where Norway monsters cast their hideous brood, Thus dark approach to strike the other slain, By the advantage of a gripe to gain, They madden as they move. Lashing the wavesâ Rushing together, each the other braves. With hearts though bath'd in flames they deafening yell,â Th' unfathom'd sea is toss'd in mountain swell. Their heads dart in the clouds! Their eyes of fire, Shoot lightning sparksâwhile streams of poison dire, Drule from their jaws! Teeth hard gnash on teethâ Their forky tongues drop cold the blood of death: Not less terrifick is the naval fightâ A cloud of horrors veils the sea in night. Impetuous, showering flame the Briton poursâ The far-off ocean with the conflict roars: But from the cause of elevating high, Her balls with lightning glimpse pass harmless by. Not so the Waspâher foe with death she stingsâ Each bolt sure-driven, a desolation brings. Splinter'd, the parts fly crashingâevery pealâ Her masts half torn, and decks the injury tell, Through gaping chinks the drowning waters rush, While sails and shrouds fall sunder'd with a crush. Yet not a thought to Manners' brain is sent, To yield the strife upon the element. By various turns and evolutions now, Columbia's vessel strikes upon the bow Of Albion's shipâand Manners cries aloud: âBoardâgrapple the Wasp!â Forth the royals crowd With sharpen'd pikes, which gleam with horror dread, Intent a havock through the Wasp to spreadâ But soon their purpose the Columbians check, And in his turn springs Blakeley on their deck: âLeapâleap the quarter!â to the brave he cries,â âWith sword in hand we grapple for the prize! Beat back the foe! plunge forward with the pikesâ And lo, their standard in submission strikes!â His gesture, voice, electrified his crewâ Ere half was utter'd, to his aid they flew. Man battles man, and falchions, falchions clashâ Swift as they glance they seem the lightning's flash. Proud names of royal bearing end in deathâ Through bleeding mouths they breathe away their breath. In single combat Manners Langdon thrust, But soon the Briton proves his mortal dust. So true the levell'd stroke, it halv'd his brainâ His life departs insensible of pain. Toscan beheldâhe rushes with his pikeâ Darken'd with anger each at other strike. The Albion bending parries off the blow, And rising quick smites Toscan on the brow. Craz'd with the wound, he leaps the vessel o'erâ Down as he sinks he leaves a train of gore. Blakeley the meantime labour'd in the fightâ His falchion six had overspread with night, While twice that number wounded, own'd his mightâ On Manners now he brandishes his swordâ But checks the pass to utter forth a word: âBriton! on me hard bend thy scowling brow! Strike yon proud standard from its summit low! Thy soul is valiantâbut thou canst no moreâ Resign the Lion to the Eagle power!â âI never yet surrender'd to a foe, Nor will I now that woman weakness show! First deep in ocean shall my body lieâ The Lion standard to the last shall fly!â This said. At once their smother'd wrath aroseâ Like two opposing clouds in heaven, they close. Their angry swords like living lightnings gleam, And flash, and glitter in the ocean stream. Betwixt the two suspended is the warâ The others stand as overcome with awe, Or rather all had yielded to the free, Save Manners bent on death or mastery: So when enrag'd young wolves and cougars meet, They close and bathe themselves in bloody sweat. Their yells rebellow through the glens afarâ As fire they burn, and madden in the war. At length their sires approachâthe young depart, And stand and gaze, though palsied in their heart. Their jaw bones chatter in a cold dismay, To mark the strugglings of the desperate fray: Something like this the mariners are seenâ A pale surprise depictur'd in their mien. Blakeley at length, with violence of blow, Disjoints oblique the shoulder of his foe. The sever'd arm falls bleeding to the deckâ The piteous blood comes gushing from his neck. The dying fingers of the slaughter'd hand, Lock with a death-grasp on the reeking brand. The cheek of Manners palesâhe faints in blood, Which as it cools thick curdles in the flood. The Cross falls droopinglyâthe Stripes ascend, Round which the Stars in shining circle bend. His virtue Blakeley proves: âThough now ye brave, Through carnage dire we've conquer'd on the wave, Yet ill should we the victory deserve, Were we to fail to brace the fainting nerve. With mercy's hand in tenderness, bestow A healing unction to the suffering foe. Gently remove them to the Wasp on board, And give all succour that our means afford. âThe prize fast drinks the seaâinstant provide To ply the suctionsâstay the rushing tide. This, Baury, be your care, whilst Reilly, you Will aid the wounded of the Albion crew.â Swift at the word the suctions lift the wave, While Baury strives the sinking bark to save. Reilly, the bleeding from the wreck conveysâ Those not exhausted he inspires with praise. In the Star-banner Blakeley wraps the clay Of Langdon and commits it to the sea, To sleep in ocean's caves till Time shall die, And a new sun shall gild Eternity. By this, the hands of healing had suppress'd The blood of Manners swoon'd. Small in his breast, The fluttering pulse returns. Blakeley stands nearâ His joy is seen to glisten through a tear: âHe wakens into life! He yet will live! Look, in his eye his being I perceive! A blush is mantling on the wan of death!â His head up-raise and give him all the breath.â Manners faint waves his hand, and strives to sayâ But his cold tongue refuses to obey. Another effort fevers in his cheekâ His tongue is loosen'dâhe begins to speak: âVain is thy wishâI feel myself decayâ My life a shadow vanisheth away. Death's icy touch upon my heart I feelâ But heaven indulgent, I to thee will tell Th' emotions of my soul: To thee is due, And every member that compose thy crew, A gratitude that never I can pay, To mark your eyes made damp with holy sprayâ The fight was mortal, but the scene sublime Will smile upon you till the end of time. A crown of honour to your name be givenâ Bright angels wrapp'd in fire will light thy path to heaven! âMy breathing fails. I faintâI can no moreâ I soon shall reach the irremediable shore. Yet one request remains: Earnest I beg, That thou wilt shroud me in my nation's flagâ Where this, my broken ship, must drink the wave, And many a worthy Briton found his grave, There let my body settle to its rest, Till the cold ocean shall dissolve my breast.â Here his tongue faulter'dâyet his fading eye, On Blakeley bentâwho made this soft reply: âTalk not of shroudsâthe pallid robes of deathâ Vain my desireâconvulsive heaves thy breath! Thy flag shall be thy shroud. O, were it in my power, How soon I'd chase the darkness of this hour! Ah, fruitless thought! How brief the thread of lifeâ To those who meet in ocean's dubious strife! But if their days be few, with light they shine, Like stars that gem the firmament divine. âBut I perceive that thou art verging nigh The bounds of lifeâstriveâstruggle to reply. Perhaps some friend that's tender to thy lifeâ Offspring, or parentâor a bosom wife, Might wish a parting word! Repeat to me, I'll bear the message to the English sea. 'Twill be a hallow'd theme to dwell uponâ O strive to give it breathâ âAlas,âhe's gone!â O'erpower'd with sorrow Blakeley sighing stoodâ Two tears unconscious from his eyelids flow'dâ Silent two others gather'd on his sight, Like dew-drops trembling on the lily white. These fellâand others wander'd o'er his cheekâ At length, full bosom'd he began to speak: âThe soul that weeps not for the virtuous dead, Is but a tyger with a heart of lead. âIn Albion's richest banner, Reilly, now His relicks shroud, becoming of the foe. Let every honour to his dust be givenâ Peace to his Spirit as it wafts to Heaven!â In solemn form his mandate is obey'dâ In Albion's flag the breathless chief is laid. Deep from the Wasp the guns of death resound, As slow the corse descends to ocean's depths profound. While this was passing, Baury strove to save The shatter'd prize from drowning in the wave. The seamen plied the suctions bath'd with toilâ Fruitlessâso swift the rushing waters boil. Blakeley, discovering to preserve the ship, Would but retard his progress on the deep, These words to Baury gave: âWe toil in vain, The bark to rescue, sinking in the main, Hence, to the Wasp the shifting gun convey, And then explode the vessel from the sea. Some haven we must make. The maim'd require, To heal their wounds from ocean to retire:â To save the prize would hinder the eventâ Hasteâply the matchâWe sail for L'Orient.â Instant the order to destroy was doneâ To Freedom's ship was roll'd the captur'd gun, And Baury having lit the match below, Sought safety in the Wasp. And rapid now, She leaps from wave to wave with vital spring, As though her movement were a living thing: So when a whale, impatient of control, Forsakes the icy regions of the pole, He cleaves the ocean with an arrow's flight, Tossing the billows, foaming in his might: So round the flying Wasp the waters roll, And foam and tumble as she leaves the pole. While thus she holds her way, the seamen turn Their eyes to see the fated vessel burn,â Fast lock'd is every tongueâa sigh, a breathâ Nothing is heardâBehold, the match beneath, Touches with fire the chamber'd vault of death! The ship leaps from the sea!âThe deafening jar Sunders the ocean from the scene afarâ Leaving a chasm vastâdash'd in whirlpool round, As though it reach'd the ocean's depths profoundâ The flames mount up to heaven!âthe sun is cast Down in the deep. Night gathers on the blastâ Combustion smothers lifeâTh' appearing stars Shrink at the sight and darken in their spheres. The spirits of the deep are heard to groan, As though their watery element was done: So when the consummating day shall come, When Death in judgment shall receive his doom, A bolt, red hissing from the arm of heaven, Through hell's dread barriers forceful will be drivenâ The dark world conflagrateâthe unbounded flame Will reach the limits of creation's frameâ The earth dissolve like stubble in the fireâ Sun, stars, moon, planets in their orbs expire. In thirty suns the Wasp in harbour moors At L'Orient. The Franks oppress the shores To catch a glimpse of her commander brave, Who the proud foe had humbled on the wave. With prying gaze they every feature scan, As though he held some virtue more than man, To have the daring chivalry and art To strike Britannia through a vital partâ Who late had broke their navy on the sea, And left them fenceless to their enemy. To Blakeley every friendship they affordâ Yea, and each mariner the Wasp on board. The wounded Britons are convey'd to shore By the light motion of a gentle oar, To see the Albions' grief, their ancient foe, The Gauls, express a sorrow for their wo. By winds adverse, for forty days and two, The Wasp is boundâunable to pursue His cruise of ocean. But with morning now, Sweet from the land the gales inviting blow. She spreads her canvass to the kissing wind, And leaves the harbour, with salute, behind. The ever-watchful Blakeley captur'd soon Two valu'd prizesâere the hour of noonâ But when upon the ocean five and three, He spied a squadron deck'd in royaltyâ The huge Armada of the battle lineâ Of brass three-tier'd,âto guard them through the brine. Blakeley their course with jealousy beheldâ And now directâand now triangling sail'dâ At length, with sudden turn he slips betweenâ And lo, a flag is in submission seenâ The vessel laden'd deep with martial stores, To give supply to the Canadian shores, On board the Wasp the captive crew convey'd, A fire consuming on her deck is laid. Again his art he practises the sameâ T' encircle others and apply the flame. Just in the act another ship to seizeâ Th' Armada rolls her thunders o'er the seas. Vain the endeavourâWith a gallant mind, He spreads his wings and leaves his foe behind. Now the sun lingers on the ocean's brim, While silver dolphins on its bosom swim, Looseâsporting in the beams with wanton play, Rippling the waters as they glide away. Which as they meet the sun, sparkle with gold, And all the beauties that in heaven unfold. Calm is the oceanâand the Wasp at rest, Sits like a swan upon its yielding breast. The sea-lads pass their time in happy glee, Singing the naval songs of Liberty. As evening shadows o'er the waters creep, The slumbering zephyrs waken from their sleepâ Their sugar breathings soon produce a galeâ It comes and kisses at the bended sail, Which glides the vessel o'er the ocean blue, As bright-ey'd Hesper trembles into view. While thus the mariners their shrill notes sung, And robes of evening on the deep sea hung, Four hostile flags upon the waters showâ Two on the larboardâtwo on starboard bow. The sailors leap the deckâsupprest the song, Their hearts sublim'd with expectation strong. Brief are the words of Blakeley: âHeroes! boldâ Enlarge the canvass! for the war-ship hold, Which to the wind and separated liesâ Another glass we sweep another prize.â Scarce was the glass exhausted of its sand, When, by the zeal of his determin'd band, Blakeley perceiv'd within the twilight deep, The foe in strength was equal to his ship. New from the builders' hands the vessels came, The Wasp to capture, sink, or burn in flameâ Castilian, Tartarus, Rapid, Avonâthese The names they bear to conquer on the seas. The last, the Avon, on the ocean free Had distant wander'd from her consorts three. Arbuthnot, ruling, thought no danger nigh, While Blakeley near'd him with determin'd eyeâ Soon he observ'd the Wasp approaching near, And in their joy his crew these mandates hear: âThe ship of Blakeley we've descried at last! Soon her existence on the main is past! But let the signals elevated fly, To bring the others in confederacy; For should we even with our strength combin'd, Cause her proud flag to shiver in the wind, 'Twould be a splendid feat. She's equal four Of France or Spain,âfrom whom, of late we tore Their banners from the deep! I even feel, That we alone could make her courage kneelâ But let the speaking signals deck the mast, That they at least, may see us pour the blast.â Arbuthnot ended. Forth the tokens high, Wave in the clouds to bring her consorts nigh, But they neglectful in their calmness there, Dream not their sister needs their every care. They mark no signals in the twilight gray, Nor think of battle, till they hear the fray, Which distant lumbers now. The captur'd gun, (The same the Wasp had late from Manners won,) Blakeley repeated flam'd upon the foe, While the proud Briton answer'd blow for blowâ But when three peals had o'er the waters run, He gave command the pressing fight to shun: âThese are sufficientâCrowd the sail and fly, Till these alarms shall draw our consorts nigh; But when they succour to our flag shall bring, Swift we'll return, and disregard her sting.â The sheets are set for sailing. Avon wears, And with endeavour from the action bears. But Blakeley, jealous, with unwinking ken, Observ'd his motives and bespoke his men: âBehold, she wears to fly! On her lee bow The ship bear down, and make her feel a blow, Never she felt! None of the ocean, none, Can the quick Wasp upon the deep outrunâ Soon through her life we'll drive the rapid ballâ The pride of Britain once again must fall!â The sails are set in trim by seamen braveâ High foams the dashing Wasp from wave to waveâ She seems to leap instinctive through the seaâ She gainsâshe winds upon the Avon's leeâ And as she windsâher heavy globes of war, Pierce her dark womb and shatter many a spar. Arbuthnot, seeing 'twas in vain to fly, Gives to his crew instructions to reply: âRoundâround the helm! The brass in broadside light, And able are we to subdue the fight. Let not a fear upon your heart be knownâ Great is the honour to contend alone. Sink in the ocean! Better far to die, Than yield the boon, the palm of victory!â Loud at his voice the Avon thunders swell, Yet few in number at their object tell, They scarce the texture of a sail wing wound, While of the Wasp death follows every round. Mad flashes glance upon the waters dire, Which line the ocean with a welt of fireâ The Avon shiversâbleeds at every blowâ Her second officer in blood is low. Through gaping chinks the waves impetuous pourâ Five feet are pressing on her keel, or more! At length she pauses to remove the deadâ And sparing Blakeley to the Briton said: âDoes Albion's ship surrender in the fight?â No answer is return'dâbut dark in night, Pausing the vessels layâBut soon the flame Kindles the darkness of the ocean stream. For minutes twelve the globes unsparing flyâ The angry flashes glancing on the sky, Like threads of lightning burning rapidly. Again the Avon pauses. Blakeley stay'd The battle's violence, this question made: âIs England's banner furl'd? We wish to spare Those who in fight surrender to our care!â Arbuthnot, wasting of life's vital heatâ (The waves of ocean had receiv'd his feet) Return'd this answer: âSad our flag is downâ Britannia yields in sorrow for her crown. Our ship is in distress! We failâwe sink! Death crowds us in the deep! On fate's dark brink Tottering we stand! Lo, scarce the Avon floats! Thy soul is mercyâsave us with thy boats!â The heart of Blakeley mov'd: âMy heroes brave, Leap to the bargesâlaunch them in the wave! They call in their distress! From death redeemâ Behold, the vessel buries in the stream.â Before his tongue had echo'd through the night, The boats were tilting on the waters lightâ And every heart was yearning to convey The bleeding Albions from the wreck away. The Avon's consorts when they heard the fight, Impatient spread their wingsâbut breezes light Their course withheld. But lo, Castilian now, Begins to make her swelling sails to show: Blakeley observes her shadow in the wave: âTo board with boats! Another ship to brave! Behold, a sister of the foe is near! Lay to the vessel! We'll reduce her here! In the late strife but two have fled to heaven, Whilst we to darkness have the Avon driven. On let her come! Our fame will never dieâ Dread are our thunders wing'd with Liberty! âBut mark! two others on the wave I see! Never successful can we meet the three. 'Tis but as murder, without hope to win, Reckless of life the battle to begin. âSpread a light sail. Perhaps as we withdraw, One may pursue and challenge us to war. With rapid hand repair the injury done, And every man stand pillar'd at his gun.â The order is obey'd. The sails are bent, And smooth the vessel through the deep is sent; But of the foe none single-handed dare Pursue the hero on the ocean there. By every nerve put forth, Castilian saves The Avon's crew from the impending wavesâ Lo, as the last were in the barges plac'd, She sunk forever in the watery waste! Blakeley his course toward Madeira Isles, With happy breezes in his pleasure sails. For days nineteen he naught but ocean spiesâ But Atalanta on the next descries. With pinions bent the Wasp her progress wings, And soon the leeward gun surrendering rings. Of th' Atalanta, Blakeley gave command To Geisingen, that his adopted land Might learn the manner he the foe had met, And bow'd their haughty standards to his feet. These were his parting words: âYoung ocean chief! To make for Wilmington, thy sails unreef; Though all the ports of Freedom are my love, Yet this most tender seems my heart to move. Disguise it as we will, there's something here, That makes us love one spot of earth most dear. Though that her streams are shallowâand her sand Scorches the stranger from a distant landâ Yet, to my soul, the richest spot of earth, Softening my heart, is Carolina Northâ Here lisps my infantâhere abides my wife, And here I first was sensible of life. âBut should the enemy, or adverse wind, Bar you the harbour ever in my mind, For Georgia's capital, or Charleston, hie, Or where a port is made conveniently. âO when thy foot shall touch upon the beach, Make no delay till you my home shall reachâ Say to that bosom sighing with alarms, I soon shall come and clasp her in my armsâ Soon as the coast of Africa I trace, To seize on those who traffick in our raceâ Than which, except Impressment on the sea, Nothing can hold with blood-bought slavery! This, when she hears, her soul will patient waitâ For oft her bosom for the Africk state Hath heav'd with sorrow press'dâ âMy thoughts are sadâ But O, 'twill make the meeting hour more glad! âComeâwe must partâthy hand. Alas, these tears! A something tells my heart for me no shore appears! âBut to my wife consoling prospects tellâ And shouldâit may not beâFarewell! Farewell!â This in retirement to the youth was said, But when he rose the deck, a smile was laid Mild on his cheek, that nothing might subdue The buoyant feelings that possess'd his crew. With shouts the Wasp and Atalanta part, The latter guided by the western chart. The shoutings done, the brazen guns repeat A distant farewell, should they never meet. Blakeley soon crowds his vessel under way To trace the shores of bleeding Africa. Meantime the Tyranny of hell,âthe foe To Freedom's equal laws in earth below, Summon'd his agency in full divan, And thus elated in his hope, began: âEarls, peers, lords, princes, nobles of the Crown! Let none distrust but We shall cast them down! No doubt remains but all New Albion now, Will place a circle on a monarch's brow! At ancient Hartford, in Convention, all The gravest of the land in senate hall, Are deep engag'd in eloquent debate, Devising measures to divide the State! Nor are Our prospects at the South so low, For Maryland of late is Royal too! Hence, when that Cockburn, Our lov'd child shall come With fire and sword he'll strike opposers dumb. âBut now, to guard the worst, hear Our command! Fashion'd must be an earthquake at Our hand, Should Cockburn fail in his endeavours there, To fill the southern borders with despair, We with explosionââ Vengeance rushing cameâ His agentâwith an eye of hell in flame, Yet pale his haggard cheek: âDread Sovereign! bend Gracious thine ear! Momentous scenes impend! The Wasp, a miniature of naval force, Subdues the boundless ocean in her course! Ships ten and three hath Blakeley captur'd late,â And two were more than equal to his weight.â Without emotion, answer'd thus the Fiend: Thy words are light as gossamer in windâ Forth We'll proceed,âand at an effort bend This insect at Our feet. The earthquake form, Whilst We retire to raise a shipwreck storm, And strike with lightning fire this Blakeley downâ And ship and mariners in ocean drown.â This said, he leaves his titled train behind, To form materials as his will design'd. His shape more hideous in his progress growsâ More hot with flame his boiling bosom glows. He gains the ocean,âfrom a beetling height He plungesâequal to a mountain weight, Rent by an earthquake. Ocean seems on fire, So vast the burnings from the Fiend aspire: Should Hecla when it rages in its might, Casting its flames beyond the reach of sight, Be loos'd tremendous from its rocky bed And plung'd in ocean like a furnace dreadâ Not a less turbulence of boiling floods, And fire, and foam ascending to the clouds, Would rise in consequence of such a break, Causing the earth at either pole to shake, Than that which thunders round the breast of Hellâ The huge leviathans in caverns yell. Not ocean cools the Fiend!âhis passion growsâ His heat increases as he onward goesâ Convolving clouds deep blacken all the sea, And from creation hide the light of day. The foaming billows into mountains swellâ But far above them towers the Fiend of hell. In dizzy clouds he half conceals his head, Whilst his broad feet the rocks of ocean tread, Crashing at every step. His voice he rolls In heavy thunders to the distant poles. His eyes, two open furnaces of fire, Flash vollied lightnings through the welkin dire. Black from his nostrils rushing whirlwinds fly, Tossing the waves tumultuous to the sky. Loud roars the deep. The earth from axle reels, And groaning nature a convulsion feels! The Wasp, a feather on the storm, is castâ Her ribs are loos'd at each redoubling blast. The seamen's guiding arts are all in vainâ She runs with frenzy whirling o'er the main. Now down a mountain billow she descends, Whilst every spar with the concussion bends. The cordage cracks. Adown each creaking mast Gleam the blue lightningsâevery soul aghast! The floods in torrents on the sailors streamâ And now the gale flat lays her on her beam. Her keel grinds the sharp rocks. And now she flies On foaming mountains to the thundering skies; Then down she plunges, by the whirlwinds drivenâ Then up she's dash'd against the stormy heaven! âThou Power Supreme! Who roughens up the sea, Or calms it when enrag'd, we look to Thee! On Thee alone, our anchor'd hopes relyâ O give our souls redeeming power to fly, To join in Heaven the bless'd society!â A white-rob'd angel, whose it was to bear To the Invisible the breath of prayer, Convey'd the voice of Blakeley to the Throneâ Whose smile a sunbeam on the hero shoneâ The gazing seraph knew the hallow'd sign, That he translated should be made divine. Fredonia on the wall of Heaven he finds, In grief to see her son the sport of winds, Toss'd on the ocean: âLoom with joy thy breast! The hallow'd Sign hath answer'd his request! To thee 'tis given, Elijah-like, to raise Entire the vessel from the storm-vex'd seas.â Fredonia heard,âtransported at her heart,â She strikes her spear!âthe walls celestial part! And as they open, lo! a flood of day Breaks with such splendour through the vacancy, The eye of mortals is surcharg'd with light, Which for the moment makes the world seem night. Like silver oil two streams united flow Smooth through the pass, and wed the deep below. A rainbow cloud supports th' empyreal streamsâ A golden radiance on their surface beams. No mind earth-born the beauty can conceiveâ No eye behold the brilliancy and live! Now when the Wasp was hurl'd midway to heaven, Brief in a moment backward to be driven Deep in the gulphing wavesâFredonia nigh, Comes in a cloud of fragrance from the sky, And with her breath, ambrosial, sweet, yet strong, Blows the wreck'd vessel on the stream along! What scenes of wonder to the sight unfold! Her pitchy hulk becomes transform'd to goldâ Ivory her spars, diaphanous as lightâ Her shrouds to silver cords divinely brightâ Her sails to silk, reflecting every dye, Like infant clouds when Beauty paints the sky. Beyond the crystal wall in heaven she moves, Where souls translated interchange their loves, Fredonia shuts the pass. With thrilling song, Infantile spirits charm the ship along. Smooth up the stream of life, in gorgeous dress, She floatsâa thing of heaven in loveliness. Now on the bosom of the lake she glides With all her beauty imag'd in the tides. Th' empyreals stand with wonder in their eye, And gaze, and gaze, to view the novelty. Blakeley in robes immortal, and his crew, Feel inexpressible their feelings new. To every sense an ecstacy is given, Fill'd with the fulness of the joys of heaven! CANTO XXXIV. THE WALL OF HEAVEN. ARGUMENT. Naval Actions pass in view before the Celestials situated on the Wall of Heaven. The scene changes to different parts of the world .... The time of this Vision is about six hours. Now when the crystal battlements gave way T' admit the vessel in divine array, A glimpse of opening heaven the Fiend subdu'dâ He shrunk in weakness cover'd with the floodâ Shrivell'd his lineaments of monster form, To the vile likeness of a reptile wormâ In this debasement he return'd to earth, Scarce known by those who had in hell their birth. Soon as from ocean had retir'd the Form, The North call'd back the whirlwinds of the storm. The far-spent billows rock themselves to rest, And white-wing'd Zephyrs smooth the ocean's breast. The clouds disparted, from the welkin fly, And heaven unfolds its splendid imagery. Lo now, th' Invisible that spoke to light The balanc'd world, withdraws his brilliance brightâ The blue and orange mingling grace the hour, While dews of evening visit every flower. Th' immortals hymn their holy songs of love, While ever-listening Echo from her grove, Repeats the numbers in melodious strain, Touching the soul exquisitely again. At length the shades recede and day appearsâ The light of Deity sublimes the spheres! A brightness that is dark around him dwells, Which e'en from seraphim his form conceals. Fredonia now in all her beauty came With bright-ey'd Victory and eagle Fame, And on the crystal battlements of heaven Stoodâwhile this musick to her tongue was given: âFame! sister of my heartâon wings of light The born of Liberty to this inviteâ For lo, a vision passes on the earth, To manifest the arm of Freedom's birth.â Fame, while her trumpet through elysian rings, Fans the pure element with silver wings. Her motion leaves the speed of light behindâ Rapid as thought, when burning from the mind. âYe born of Freedom! listen to the call! I come to bid you to the diamond wall. Behold, this day upon the earthly sphere, Deeds to display Columbia's character, Will pass in vision in a style that's newâ Bringing the past and present into view. âWhere Blakeley enter'd the preceding even, There forth assemble, ye divine of heaven!â Sweet as she clos'd she blew her trump so clear, 'Twas passing musickâravishing the ear. Th' Immortals riseâmillions on millions round, And full assemble at the clarion's soundâ From heaven's extremest verge in vast extent, As earth, the sun, and starry firmament; But as their movement travels with the mind, A moment finds them at the spot design'd. So bright their forms with the celestial ray, The diamond splendour vanishes away. Where Hesper shines, Fredonia takes her standâ Justice and Washington on either hand. Green, Franklin, Warren, Putnam, on the right, With all who bar'd the steel in Freedom's fight: Columbus, Truxton, Prebleânames of worth, File on the left to mark the vision'd earthâ Brooks, Ludlow, Blakeley, Allen, Lawrenceâall, Who strove for right on the terraqueous ball. Th' expanding ocean curls beneath their viewâ The rivers gushing from their fountains new, Tumbling in cataracts o'er the mountain's brow, Chafing the waters into wreaths of snowâ But soon they smooth their bosoms to the sun, And in loose mazes to the ocean run. The lakes, like silver seas or mirrors fair, In which the things of heaven appear more rare, Unfold with beauty to their gazing eye, Reflecting back their own bright imagery. The host immortal feel a new delight, As roll their mountains and their streams in sight. A tender passion moves upon their breast To mark the spot, where they in childhood press'd The swelling bosom of maternal loveâ Or jocund carroll'd to the echoing grove. But when they gaze upon the martial plains, Where they victorious broke the tyrant's chains, They feel the former kindling of their flameâ The PhÅnix fire of never-dying fame. Where Charles pours down his tribute to the sea, Bunker sublime, comes looming into day. The spires of Trenton, tipt with golden lightâ The Muses' seat at Princeton, glads their sightâ Proud Bennington beneath the Mountains Green, And Saratoga to the north are seenâ The plains of Monmouth in their verdure rise, And Guildford wakens holy sympathies. The Spring of Eutaw glitters to the sun, Whose silver waves o'er golden pebbles runâ Then York appears where Tyranny expir'd, And Freedom rose by Virtue self inspir'd. These scenes and others, sanctified by fameâ (No mortal tongue could number them by name,) Roll into view before th' admiring sight Of gazing millions on the diamond height. Now two dark battle-ships with hostile mien, East of the Island State are threatening seenâ The larger bears the ensign of the throneâ The Stars of Freedom make the other known. The royal vessel kindles into warâ The Eagle seems endeavouring to withdrawâ Shuning the conflict on the ocean deepâ Her bolted thunders dead their silence keep. Truxton breaks forth to mark her failing blood, Whilst heaven suspended at her conduct stood: âMy heart feels earthly! Whatâand can it be, Our ship will prove a dastard on the sea? Her chief in naval robes looks firm in soulâ His eyes two meteors in their casements roll. NeverâAh no!âI comprehend his artâ I scan the secret purpose of his heart. He rounds the helmâhe gains his object nowâ Hark! how he thunders on the Albion's prow! Their brass they seem with spirit hands to plyâ Scarce three to six is heard the enemy. What nimble fires put death upon the ballsâ See! the mast creensâit topplesâseeâit falls! Another! and another!âHark! the gun! The foe has yielded and the Eagle won! âBright Goddess, say what different names they bear, And who commands them on the ocean there?â Thus he. Fredonia then: âThe ship that's bent, Her standards buried in the element, Is the GuerriereâDacres, but late with pride, Challeng'd the brave to meet him on the tide, He held a stern defiance in his eye, But now he feels what strength is Liberty. âYet generous feeling dwelt within his breastâ To shun the fight,âhe suffer'd the Impress'd To leave the deckâand not their hands imbru'd In brothers' bloodâa theme of gratitude. âThe victor ship, the Constitution nam'd, For years twice seven on the ocean fam'd, Is rul'd by Hull, within whose ample heart Honour residesâguided by virtue's chart. His rising worth magnificent will shine, Till yonder orbs in darkness shall decline. Life will he gain in death!â âNow, each his sight Bend to the south and mark the gathering fight!â To southern latitudes they turn their eye, And there the elder Wasp and Frolick spy, Rolling and tumbling on a tempest floodâ Jones, the Wasp guiding, Whinyates, Albion's blood, Who with Iberia's flag deceptious ridesâ Jones nears and hails him on the boisterous tides: âWhat ship with neutral standard in the air?â Whinyates rejoins: âThe Frolick, thee to dare! âDownâAlbions, downâbring down the dark disguise, And let the banner of our nation rise! Mark, as we mount upon the heaving swell, Let full explosions on Columbia tell.â Brief was the order. Firm the Britons stood With matches lightedâas they rise the flood, They put them forthâelance the flames afar, Which kindle nothing save the whirling air. Their balls o'ertop the Wasp, and Jones exclaims: âYe prime of ocean!âlet them flash the flames! Down as we sink upon the billowy sea, Touch the quick sparkle with rapidity. The wave recedes! Flames carry to each gun! The Wasp flash'd death the instant he was done! Her every effort stings the Frolick through, Searching the life of her determin'd crewâ Each several time she settles on the wave, Full many a Briton finds a watery grave. But though the very life of Albion fails, Yet to resistance none submissive quails. At times the pinions of the Wasp she wounds, And sunder'd cordage on the deck resounds. But lo, the anger'd Wasp heeds not the blast, That wounds a pulley, sail, or shroud, or mast. Down as the settles on the tossing flood, She draws in smoking streams the Frolick's blood. The billows madden as the battle roarsâ At times the yawning ocean half devours The Wasp in blazeâher guns oft drink the deepâ But when they strike the Albion seems to leap In torment from the sea, so dread they bore Her hollow wombâblood stains the water o'er. At length the Wasp of Frolick shoots ahead, While numbers hot with life fall instant dead. Near and more near she edges down in prideâ Soon the bold seamen touch the Frolick's side, As they their sponges draw, sweating a streamâ Crowding the jaws of death to vomit flame; Behold, two engines through the port-lights frownâ They pour destruction forthâthe Albion life is done! Now through the Wasp an emulation ran, Who should first board and be the happy man. One draws the other back, and then crowds onâ But he is ousted from his place as soon. Riddle and Baker are the favour'd two, Who with proud effort, breaking from the crew, Leap upon the prize!â How direful the scene! The deck is cover'd with the skulls of men, And hearts rent piecemealâbroken brainsâand hair Matted in blood and scatter'd here and there. Groans of the dying load the funeral gale, Which sounds more death-cold as their pulses fail. The broken shrouds lie tangled with the slain, While a thick gore is seen upon the main. Riddle, the shiver'd standard from on high, Strikesânone had life to sink it from the sky! Th' immortal host turn silent from the scene, But Justice speaks with an unalter'd mien: âFor Albion this a retributive hourâ At length she feels the weakness of her power. For slave Impressment she receives full dear, For which, her Howard daily sheds a tearâ I met his Spirit as I pass'd along, Mourning in anguish this soul-eating wrong.â As Justice clos'd, Lawrence, bending his eyes Towards the north, two home-bound ships descriesâ The one, with canvass, masts, and cordage torn, The other o'er the wave in triumph borneâ And thus the man of heaven: âWhat vessels these, Cleaving the Island Sound with infant breeze? But now methinks the foremost ship United States. I knowâ Decatur rul'd her when I dwelt below. The stranger awkward limping at her stern, Looks though she'd seen her hidden lightnings burn.â He scarce had spoken when a chariot roll'd Smooth from the ocean in a flame of goldâ Its wheels, eight rainbows join'd,âits hubs, four stars, More sweet than Venus, and more bright than Mars. The spokes, the sunbeams that bedeck the sky, When fresh they glitter in their infancy. Its seat, a silver cloud, soft as the breath, That breathes vitality to dust beneath, Lac'd round with gold and amber-melting rays, Divine as heaven to draw an angel's gazeâ Its radiant traces were of star-beams wove By infant fingers in their spheres above. Two seraphims, commission'd from on high, With wings adapted for immensity, Cleave it from earth on exhalations rare, As though a present deity were there. âMarkâmark the wonder! See, what bounds from earth!â Thus breaks the Goddess in a transport forth: âBehold the carâthe workmanship of heaven, Through the void universe by seraphs driven! Methinks familiar is the stranger's mienâ 'Tis Funkâhis smile of virtue have I seen. His mortal dust is in the deep dark waveâ But lo, he comes!â âMy sonâmy offspring brave, I joy to greet thee in the realms of bliss, To drink th' unfailing streams of happiness. âBut now the naval circumstance recite Before th' Immortals crown'd with starry light.â The ocean warrior clad in sky robes new, Paus'd in his bliss, then spoke the battle through: âIn nine degrees and twenty north, we saw The Macedonian in her pride for war. Full in her favour blew the swelling wind, And hence she chose what distance she design'd. We answer'd not at firstâtill edging nigh, We veil'd the deep in fiery canopyâ For lo, so fierce, incessant was the blaze, They thought our vessel burning on the seas! They shouted, Victory!!âTheir joy was shortâ For whole divisions bled by our report. Such was the scene of havock and despair, It seem'd that Death had us'd his sickle there. âMy breast was broken as declin'd the fray, Through which my spirit burst its prisoning clay. Tranc'd,âcircumfus'd in light I clomb the sphereâ Of which I nothing knowâbut now I find me here!â He ended. Forth the vanish'd listeners strung Their golden harps which o'er their shoulders hung. Prelusiveâsweetâin symphony, they playâ At length they join their voices to the lay: âHail to the rising of Columbia's land!â Hail to the heroes of the naval band! Hail to Decatur!âlet his name rebonnd, Till earth from heaven shall hear the echo'd sound!â Silence attended when the hymn was sung, And thus Fredonia, with descriptive tongue: âBeneath the star North Star. immoveable, behold The royal Boxer in her robes of goldâ Her glittering streamers fix'd upon the mast, In lofty token never to be cast.â The Goddess motion'd with her hand serene, And north they gaze upon the ocean green, Where they the Boxer in full dress descry, Like a proud coquette bent on victory. And soon in vision on the sea they mark, In simple vestments a Columbian bark. Blakeley exclaims with pleasure in his eyes: âThe Freedom vessel is the Enterprize! Her once I rul'd. The war-ship is the same, Which at Tripoli laurel-wreath'd her nameâ A host she slaughter'd of the Barbary foe, While not from Liberty one drop did flow. Thisâthis was Sterrett's featâa feat to give The hero fame while valour's acts shall live. âWhen of the Wasp I rose in my command, I gave the vessel into Burrows' handâ Than whom none ever flew before the wind, With more illustrious sentiments of mind. âBut mark the scene!â Sudden the Boxer flies With brass in flame upon the Enterprizeâ Burrows, advancing silent, bears the shotâ But now at hand, he streams the lightning hot. The haughty foe is melted by the blastâ He cries for mercy with his banners fast, Floating above! A yielding word is all The Patriots need to stay the slaughtering ball. But who is that reclining on his arm, His bosom crimson'd from his vitals warm? 'Tis Burrows, ah 'tis he!âthe only blood Columbia sheds that mingles with the floodâ But this is richerârich beyond compare, And makes the purchase of the vict'ry dear! MacCall, the second of the ship draws nigh With Albion's conquer'd swordâheaving a sigh, He thus to Burrows, dying: âLo, I bear The sword of Blythe, shrouded in death-robes there But ahâtoo late!âthy hand is icy coldâ Thine eye too dark the trophy to behold!â His words are musick to his fainting heart, And a flush'd rose to either cheek impart: âReach me the blade!â He clasp'd it to his breast, And the last passion of his soul express'd: âWith joy I slumber, crown'd with vict'ry's wreathâ I smile upon thy spear, thou tyrant Death! Methinks I feel my spirit loose to fly! How sweet is death! Contented now I die!â He breath'd no more. Fredonia from the height, Flew to the ocean like descending light. Handed she guides his new-fledg'd soul on high, While heaven salutes him with its harmony: âCome, Burrows!âcome! martyr of Freedom! come! We greet thee welcome to thy joyous home! Come, feast on nectarâdrink of heaven, and live! Come, son of fame!âeternal life receive!â He comes transported, mid the shouting host, And lands with wonder on the diamond coast. A second time the ship of Hull is seenâ Bainbridge her chiefâwith dignity of mienâ Lock'd in fierce conflict with the Java's pride, Streaming the flashes glancing o'er the tide. So vast at each they pour the lightning blaze, They 'pear like islands burning on the seas. Near and more near they terrible advance, While globes like thunder-balls at either glance. But lo, the Albion withers every blastâ At times, down crashing falls a sunder'd mast. Lambert, her officer in blood is roll'dâ Yet the fray magnifiesâFold after fold Curls the blue smoke, concealing half from sight The ships, the ocean, and the maddening fight. Bainbridge impatient: âBoard! grapple, ye brave, The foe surrenders, or she drinks the wave!â Forth at command they rush with pike and sword, To lay the Java with their death on board. What daring chief is that who leads the band, Showing his purpose with extended hand? 'Tis the fair Aylwinâof superior soul, Who oft had heard the ocean thunders roll. Alas, he reels in blood! Delany sprung, A brother youth, the time the bullet sung, And held him to his breast,ârescu'd his fallâ But as he strove to bear him from the ball, The bleeding hero thus: âHere, by the mast, Let me remain to breathe away my last! Noâneverânever will I pass below, Till I behold the conquering of the foe. âWe range upon her bowâher ribs we tear! We strike her heart! She kneels in her despair! âLife is no value now! Flyâfly, my soul! Of mortal sinews scorn the vile control. The things of earth retire! heaven fills my sight! I breathe no more! I bound on wings of light!â The word last utter'd, half was spoke on earthâ And half, where Virtue finds a second birth! And now the Peacock and the Epervier, Lock'd in contention on the sea appear. The Bird of Beauty, Warrington commands, And Wales, the foremost of the Briton stands. Peals answering peals like heaven's artillery rollâ Elancing fire seems lightning from the pole. Pillars of rising smoke the ships involveâ The boiling waves beneath the flames dissolve. The strife at length subsidesâthe thunders cease, And the wild tumult settles into peace. On the light breeze the volum'd smoke rolls byâ The Albion shows her dying agony. Her spars, her sails, her shrouds, her every stay, Wide-scattering o'er the deck in ruins lay. Her forward mast is shiver'dâhalf in twain, Threating each breath, a plunging in the main. With nine times five her womb is broken through,â In blood dissolving, lie her pulseless crew! Lo, every feather of the Bird is seen Spread in the breeze upon the wave sereneâ No crimson drop her glittering breast distainsâ But rich with life she cleaves the watery plains. Gazing in silent awe th' immortals stand, To mark the conquests of the ocean bandâ And Preble, fill'd with his celestial birth, The gladdening impulse of his soul pours forth: âFame's quenchless halo to the brave belongâ YeaâEarth and Heaven will join in choral song! Freedom! thy triumphs never will expireâ But when the universe is wrapp'd in fireâ When all material substances are lostâ And the mix'd virtue of the earth is dross'dâ When Time shall failâand Space shall wind the wholeâ And all the burning lights forsake the poleâ Then, then in heaven new,âthy deeds will sound In hallow'd accents through the vast profound! âNot yet the vision clos'd! New scenes unfold, Conquest on conquestâheaven in wonder hold! Markâmark the Eagle in her pride of state! Behold the Lion crouching to his fate! The stars so brilliant in their glory shine, My soul seems fainting, though of mould divine! âEmpyreal Goddess, O, in brief explain, Who now is crown'd with laurels on the main?â Fredonia artless with her sweetest note: âThe Hornet, Penguin, on the azure float. Biddle, whose name is honour, rules the firstâ But Dickenson, the Albion, sleeps in dust. Brief was the conflict burning on the seaâ But once again Britannia bow'd the knee. âBe not your souls in admiration lost, Or yet the vision will your powers exhaust. âNow turn your eyes and mark two vessels bent To strike Columbia from the elementâ Cyane, Levantâdetermin'd in the strife To humble Stewart, liberal of his life. The ship he holds, uninjur'd has withstood Their proudest efforts, and the fight subdu'd. Bainbridge and Hull beneath her flag have fought, And to the enemy submission taught. âBeneath the three the ocean flames on high, Mingling with lightnings leaping from the skyâ Lo, nothing is discern'd, with war o'ercastâ And all the air is tortur'd with the blast.â The Goddess paus'd th' event. The stirring breeze Bears off the smoke along the troubled seas. Stewart veers round upon Cyane asternâ Her Cross is down!âher thunders cease to burn. But lo, the other struggles through the deep, Striving in vain t' avoid the conquering ship: In manner of a wounded snake she moves, Leaving the harvestâcreeping to the groves. He wreaths his scaly foldsâdarts out his tongue, And drags with labour slow, his deep-bruis'd length along: The Briton thus hard struggles on the sea, Turning and twisting to avoid the frayâ But Stewart soon beholds her limping slow, While blood is seen adown her waist to flow, To strike her flagâthat humbling act to shun, Thinking his mind was occupied with oneâ But Stewart's mind was ever vigilant To mark the wary movement of Levantâ Cyane secur'dâher, tilting he pursues, And every thought to run the sea subdues. She failsâsurrenders to his guns abowâ The laurels fade that deck'd the Albion brow! The gazers musing stood. At length, a song Echo'd with rapture from their every tongue: âThe fame of Stewart is a quenchless lightâ He gilds his country with a radiance bright. Loud and more loud let pÃ¦ans sound through heaven, Till to the earth the musick shall be given!â During four moons, Floyd, with Plantagenet, The deep but narrow pass to York besetâ Save the small vessels sailing from her reach, Keeping the rippling waves that wash the beach. To stop this ingress, which the city fed, Floyd sent his Shark, whose keel was shallow laidâ Her weight two mortarsâcannon five and three, To drive the infant vessels from the sea. Some flew her powerâbut others on the stream Surrender'd,âsluggish laden'd to the brim. This plac'd a smile upon the royal heartâ But Percival is seen to coy with art The British Prowler with a fisher's bark, Freighted with luxuries to allure the Shark. Bent on deception, Percival appears A simple fisher, and the one who steersâ These only open to the day are seenâ But lo, beneath the deck are twice fifteen, Belted with arms to leap upon their prey, When the word, LawrenceâPercival should say. Soon as the Shark th' attempting boat descried, She bent her sails to seize her on the tide. The artful vessel imitating fear, Took every turn to gain the ocean clearâ Such was her seemingâwhile a clog she drew, Her speed restrain'd, and favour'd well her viewâ By which the royal Shark soon gain'd her side, And brought her to with a commanding pride. With false reluctance, Percival obey'd, And close to board his fishing vessel laid. But while with pleasure smil'd the Briton's cheekâ âLawrence!â he criedâand stamp'd upon the deck! His secret band burst upward like a flameâ And, icy on the foe their weapons gleam! Thus while the dew is fresh, a traveller moves With lingering step to taste the summer grovesâ Serene his bosomâthoughts remote from fearsâ Behold, a serpent at his feet appears! His shining crest erectâand eyes on fire,â Darting his tongue all wet with poisons direâ Changing his coloursâpanting as for breathâ Coil'd in the act to leap the leap of death! The traveller's blood congealsâhis frighted eyes Stare from their casementsâfetter'd with surprise: Not otherwise alarm'd the Albions stood, When band of Percival rush'd for their blood. Down sunk the Crossâthe Eagle mounted high, And clapp'd her wings rejoicing in the sky. Forth a new battle on the sea begun Betwixt the President, Endymionâ The ships emerge from out a cloud of fire, Showing the marks of conflagration dire. Loose in the breeze the sulphur cloud is seen, Slowly receding o'er the deep dark green. The blood of bravery from the vessels runâ But shatter'd, conquer'd is the Endymionâ Her masts are brokenâcordage swept away, With scarce the power to float upon the seaâ While lo, Decatur's flags proud shadows fling, Save a few cords are loosen'd on the swing. But now a squadron with the Cross in air, Down on the victor in their darkness bearâ Involving mists upon the deep arise, And veil the sequel from the gazing skies. The lives of Babbit, Howell, Hamilton, Through the red mouths upon their breasts had runâ And now in heaven they join'd the empyreal throngâ And Lawrence thus to Hamilton the young: âI saw thine eyes once crowded to the brim, And heard thee whisperââO that I were him!â âThy wish is granted. Here no grade is knownâ Though numbers numberless, one soul alone Pervades this sumless multitudeâwhose gaze Hath been transported to behold the blaze Of naval actions brightening on the sea, Never to darken through eternity. âBut tell me if my dust on British clay Slumbersâor near the tombs where freemen lay?â He thus: Thus Hamilton: âTo speak the change Of immortalityâtranslation, strangeâ Exceeds the highest efforts of my tongue, Though every fibre is with heaven new strung! Vainâvain is the desireâBut hear me speak Of things of earth to brighten on thy cheek, âTwelve sons of ocean pass'd the narrow wave, And rais'd thy buried dust from Albion's grave, And homeward bore it to thy native earth, To be entomb'd where it receiv'd its birth. 'Twas wash'd in copious fountains of the heart, Till death's deep stain was bleach'd from every part. Thy wife approach'd, half smiling through her tear, To see the honours heap'd upon thy bier.â Her to hear nam'd, Lawrence a something felt, Though bless'd with heaven, that made his bosom melt. The Armstrong nowâthe smallest ship of sea, That waves the starry flag of Liberty, Guided by Reidâin vision next appears, And draws the wrapp'd attention of the spheres. Tagus, Plantagenet, Carnation fair, In neutral haven on the Patriot bear. But Reid, invincible, with daring crew, Shivers their barges as they crowd in view. Carnation late in bloom, withers aheadâ Britannia grieves for twelve times twenty dead! Others pass rapidly before their sightâ The deeds of Barney, terrible in fightâ Moffat, Champlin, and Clair, and Endicott, Whose names will live till ocean is forgot. Tarbell and Lewis with their shallops bore Their lofty ships, and strike them from the shore. Charybdis meets in battle with Blockade, But soon upon the deck the Cross is laid. The Council Orders with five engines small, Strikes the Opossum with unsparing ballâ Nor was there time allow'd to mock at death, So fast the Orders drew away her breath. The gallant Wilson with the Townsend wars, Who soon surrenders to the conquering cause. The Dolphin, rul'd by Stafford, next is seenâ Whose features character a hero's mein, Gaining two others, each superior power, With scarce a sail-thread of the Dolphin tore. Boyle foils a squadorn by himself aloneâ Than him more brave, not history hath shownâ While stars shall travel heaven the Comet's rays Will light the world with their effulgent blaze. The light-wing'd Hazard on the curling sea Subdues two regal flagsâher brass but three. Not with a breath LeChatler's fame shall dieâ Not while shall live a friend to Liberty. Next potent Rodgers with full gales is sent Through the broad ocean in the President. He thunders now upon the Belvidereâ But soon she shelters in the harbour near. Round wears the hero with affliction deepâ To lose the prize constrain'd his eye to weep. Four times he measures th' Atlantick wave, But none durst meet him and his anger braveâ Soon as they mark the whitening of his sail, They spread their wings and bound before the gale. At length, to enter York the hero steers, And Franklin thus, expressive of his fears: âNow must he bend his flagâfor lo, I mark A Line of Battle to consume his bark. âRodgers, retireâthe dangerous pass avoidâ Thy Stars must fallâthy vessel be destroy'd. âBut see, he furls his wings and seems to dare The triple enemy to combat there!â While thus the sainted man with soul regretâ Near Rodgers had approach'd Plantagenetâ He for a moment pausesâInstant, lo, His spirits mount, and these expressions flow: âBehold, a three-tier'd battle-ship in sight! What are your thoughts?âto vanish from her might? Noâdie before her!âsayâwhat say you?âspeak! What beat your bosoms?âare their pulses weak? They beat eternal life!ânever to flyâ But for the cause triumphantly to die! Be but resolv'd, and we her flag shall down, And be the last forgotten in renown! âReady for action, let the ship be clearâ Begone each downward thoughtâeach coward fear. What death more glorious can our souls acquireâ We die to liveâto shine like stars of fire! âWhat stays her coming forth? It cannot be, That she declines to meet us on the sea! A challenge gun explodeâinvite her down, Here will we die, or rend th' Impressing Crown! âWhat, what detains her? Challenge her again! And let your valour sparkle o'er the main! âHer anchor holds her yet! And does she fear Three powers to one, in strife to meet us here? âExpand the woven wings! We'll pass the foeâ Never she'll dare a hostile act to show.â The nimble mariners the white wings spreadâ Rustling they fillâand bear the ship ahead. Lo, as the Eagle makes the Lion near, He shrinks, he settles 'neath the wave for fear. Scarce breathe the Albions while their hearts beat deadâ Their joints trembling relaxâtheir teeth chatter in their head. As Rodgers pass'd in hailing distance by, He caus'd a shout to peal along the sky: âProud Albion! hear!âwhere's thy Impressment now? The winds refuse thy dastard flag to show!â Plantagenet, to hear their voices pour, Parted her cable short and vanish'd from the shore! The host of heaven stood pausing with surprise, And scarce believ'd their ever-truthful eyes. Justice the silence breaks: âBritannia! now, For slave-Impressment thou art brought full low! Thy spirit failsâforever goneâ'tis brokeâ Thou find'st it death on Freedom's power to look! Hasteâhasten to the flames thy sea-proud songsâ No more to thee the ocean wave belongsâ Thy thousand ships cannot uphold thee nowâ Thy Lion crouches from his infant foe! Dear is the price for slaving on the mainâ Thy power is broken for this crimson stain. The Franks ere long upon the ocean tide, With new-lit thunders will reduce thy prideâ Above the wave Iberia lift her headâ And Russia from the north thy naval joints unthread! âWhom I support, opposers lap the dustâ Columbia, tower to heaven, thy battle cause is just!â Th' Immortals listen'd to the language sweet, And with a shout his closing words repeat: âWhom Justice aids, opposers lap the dustâ Columbia, tower to heaven, thy battle cause is just!â CANTO XXXV. VISION SCENE CONTINUED. ARGUMENT. The Celestial Vision passes from the Ocean to the Land. The scene is laid in different parts of the United States .... The period is about six hours. When the shrill echo of their voice was done, Fredonia blushing, with a smile begun: âThis for the ocean. Now, ye bless'd of heaven, The scenes of earth in vision will be givenâ There the bright radiance of your eyes extend, And see your sons their liberties defend.â Th' Immortals heard, and bent their sight divine, To where the streams between the mountains shine. Bordering where Johnson had Tecumseh slew, A dubious combat rises into viewâ Holmes in the front, with iron-breasted band, Rank'd with the first that ever drew a brandâ Is dimly notic'd from the Wall on high, Compass'd with Britons, fighting gallantlyâ Close and more close, they hem the Patriots roundâ Warm blood intoxicates the reeling groundâ In vain the royals struggle for the wreath That blooms immortalâflourishes in deathâ Wasted of strength they shelter in the wood, Leaving the proudest of their names in blood. And now, on Georgia's plain is Newman seen, In fierce engagement with the savage men. Soon they recede and leave their King behindâ But lo, their second Chief, unbent in mind, Forth his host congregates. With madness stung They drive to battle with a howling tongue, Deafening the woods. Against the Georgians dire, They shower their flames to melt them down with fireâ But Newman stands unshaken with his few, And steady wastes them of their strength like dew. Three several times they giveâBut lo, once more, They crowd the valley with augmented power. Their wounds they disregardâto seize their King, Storming they comeâswords, bayonets, rifles ring: So when fierce lions had a tyger slain, And ground him breathless on the sandy plainâ T' avenge his loss the tygers grim unite, And hem the lions circling them in fight. Each grapples eachâthey gnash, they gash, they growlâ The mountains tremble with the savage howl. In others' blood they bathe their foaming jawsâ Nor this will yieldânor that resign the cause. From bristling manes electrick sparkles riseâ Death's fiery arrows shooting from their eyes:â Thus they the conflict held. Their chieftain now, Seizes the King, defiance of the foeâ But Newman levelsâswift the burning death Sings on and strikes their leader through his breathâ Their second champion slain, the wildmen fly, But in their flight they find mortality. The monster nation of the Creeks appears, Rough in their arms to flood the land in tearsâ But Coffee, soon at Tallahatche meets The blood-grim'd cannibals and their life completes. And Jackson, terrible, his arm makes bare, Whose name to savage palsies like despair. At Talledega, slaughter rent the fieldâ At Tallapoosa was their warwhoop quell'd. Still there remains a horde yet unsubdu'd, Darkening an isle in Alabama's flood, Flam'd with a passion kindled from despair, Fix'd in resolve in find their death-beds there. Benton, the stream descending, soon descries Ambush'dâhalf hid, his cluster'd enemies. Benton, a name the people will revereâ He pleads their causeâmaintains their characterâ Missouri's star of promise, which displays A light to gladden through remotest days. The senate listen to his voice as one, Whom none surpasseth in comparison. Opposite the isle on either bank, His band divided, and in martial rank, Ready they stand to point the weapons forth, And cause their blood to stream upon the earthâ No hopeâno succour, should the sign but wave T' elance the flame to strike them to the grave. The savage dream no mercy is at hand, Hence, with close art they crouch upon the land, Their rifles bent and sighted on the bead, To do for death, till number'd with the dead. Lo, a white banner to the breeze is given! The wild-men hail it as a sign from heaven. In a light pinnace, Benton cleaves the floodâ An aged chief comes forward form the woodâ They meet with their attendance on the beach, And Benton thus salutes him with a speech: âBehold, this token of thy peace I bearâ Give but thy friendship, and thy lives we'll spare. Yea, to thy children we'll a father be, And make them flourish like a water'd tree, On which the sun his beams delights to throw, To cause it lovely in its form to grow. âCruel advisers must have fill'd your ear, That you might fall beneath our lifted spear. Have we not all our promises made good? Then why the hatchet raise to shed our blood? We've cloth'd, we've shelter'd, yea, we've bounteous fed Your wives and children with sustaining bread. âI see thine eyes are tearfulâCome, we'll join Our hands in peace, and, as from yonder vine Thick hang the clustering grapesâso thick shall be Our future acts of leagu'd confederacy.â Here Benton gave his hand. The forest child, To his deliverer with emotion smil'dâ The smile was like a rainbow in the west, The thunder silenc'd in the cloud's deep breast. Th' Empyreals hung upon the scene:âand soon, With harps forever in harmonious tune, They sung the name of him Benton. whose tongue sincere, Melted the savage heart till fell the soften'd tear. Parker, Sir Peter Parker. a titled Knight, eager to seek Inglorious plunder in the Chesapeake, Anchors his navyâlands upon the beach, Intent the luxuries of the land to reach, And crowd his longing vessels with the same, Reckless what passes with his future name. Boasting he moves impatient to succeedâ But lo, he meets obstruction from a Reedâ No feeble, pliant shrubâin heart, an oakâ Who, on his felon band lets fall a stroke, Which crushes them to earthâthey fly the plain, Save those who quiver with a crimson stain. The cheek of royal Knighthood waxes paleâ His longing appetites for luxuries failâ For him the surgeon's art can do no goodâ The wretched man is folded in his blood. His body sweats with death's cadaverous dewsâ A theme for Byron to disgrace his Muse. Now Ball, the hero on Sandusky's bank, And ten twice toldâwhile scouting loose in rank, Hear the dire yell of savagesâand lo, A moment having pass'dâtheir features show! Impetuous on the horde the Patriots wheelâ Swift from its smothering scabbard leaps the steel. Each singles out his man his life to foilâ Now these, now those, lie gasping on the soil. Their dripping falchions smite with battering crash, Whilst angry sparkles round about them flash. Ball, soul-enrag'd, down thunders from his horse, And closes with the chief of sinewy force. They toil, they sweat, they tug, they pant, they strain, To cast each other on the gory plain. With arms o'er shoulders glu'd, their binding hands Crowd breast to breast, as fix'd with iron bands. Neck to each neck hard lock'd with head bent o'erâ The brow convuls'd, and eye surcharg'd with gore, With writhing effort tight their muscles swell, While sweats of blood adown their limbs distil: So once a hunter on Missouri's plain, Where flowers neglected, bud and bloom in vainâ Wounded an elk with branching horns on highâ It leap'd, an arrow, ere it fell to dieâ Losing the anxious hunter with its wound,â But soon, it fainting dropp'd upon the ground. Two hungry bears advanc'd to seize the preyâ Each claim'd the carcassâfierce began the fray, Blood boiling in their hearts:âtheir whelps stood by To urge them on and fever to supply. Erect in air they carried on the broil, To force each other backward from the spoil. Their jaws foam'd crimson, and their gnashing teeth Struck glancing fire to give the wounds of death. Thus Ball and savage struggle on the fieldâ Nor this gives backâthe other scorns to yield. At length, the Patriot took the monster's heelâ An up-whirl'd oak upon the earth he fell. A pointed rock receiv'd him in his fall, Breaking the bones which form the mental wall. His shatter'd brains come floating on the groundâ Yet still his eye with savage fierceness frown'd. To mark their leader slain, his hideous crew, T' avenge his death, more wild the strife renew. Mad like a swell'd-up stream they foaming comeâ But soon their fountains drain'd they sink into the tomb. Next in the vision shown is Christler's Field, Obscure beneath the violence conceal'd. Ripley is known by his superior air, Breaking the enemyâAnd now in square, He waits the foe approaching to the fightâ Again the hero scatters them in flightâ Reckless they crowd upon his strength againâ Again he meets and stoops them to the plainâ Full many a patriot mingles with the slain. The generous Covington is weltering seen, His heart faint flutteringâpale his sinking mien: âEnvious I bleed upon the lap of earthâ The hour of death is sweeter than of birthâ Then is the time of griefâbut O, to die A martyr in the cause of Liberty, Such sweet impulsions to the soul are given, Tears damp the eye as angels shed in heaven. O may my blood a rich oblation prove, To shower the land with blessings from above! âToo long I've held th' ascension of the Mindâ Take thy departure on the wings of wind!â The chariot seraph-wing'd forsook the sky, And instant rais'd him to sublimity. Th' Empyreals hail'd him with a song, that thrill'd With ecstacyâand all the regions fill'd With musick, such as elevates the eye To gaze as though it felt divinity. At length, sweet silence came. Ere long, they mark A thousand sable ships with purpose dark, Norfolk to sackâits temples conflagrate, And crush the country with o'erwhelming weight. Griev'd Washington accosts the heavenly Maidâ Like these the words the sainted Patriot said: âMy soul hath felt a sacred jubilee, To mark my children conquer on the sea, And proud their deeds upon the field survey'dâ But now I fear the starry gems must fade. âBut say, bright Goddess, who conducts the band, With dark intent to desolate the landâ And who upon the Island, Craney Island. looks so fair, To guard his country from invasion there.â Thus spoke the man of heaven. Fredonia thus: âCockburn his nameâa name most infamous. He joys to wring the grief from widows' eyes, And hear the bitterness of orphan cries. âThe youth of gallant bearing, clad in steel To guard the Island, is the valiant Nealeâ His heart the seat of honour, and his eye Brightens with beams of starry Liberty. âBut look, Britannia moves upon the waveâ Now mark, of thine th' inheritance you gave.â As artless thus the Goddess clos'd her speech, A band of spoilers struck upon the beach, And hurried on with proud intentions press'd, To plunge their weapons in the Eagle's breast. But the bold Faulkner, planted at the pass, Soon foils their purpose with exploding brass. Not small the lives they forfeit on retreatâ The hero melts them with pursuing heat. And now the vessels move in dark array To storm the Isle and sweep its flag away, Not apprehending to receive a check, Till spoils of Norfolk freighted every deck. But as approaching on the wave they show, From the bold Neale these proud emotions flow: âBehold, the darkening of the foe appears! Forget the earth and mount upon the spheres! Yeaâwhere your sires abide, there wing the soul, And place your names upon immortal scroll! What though the enemy the deep obscures,â Be these our thoughts, and then our fame enduresâ We guard our bosom infants at the breast, And aged mothers waiting for their rest! Be this our themeâand let invaders pourâ Our brass will talk of death when near the shore! Never we yield till in our blood they tread, Our bodies drain'dâjoin'd bosoms with the dead! âBut mark, impetuous on the wave they come! Touch the quick sparkle! Luxury the tomb!â Dread is the talk of death!âyeaâequal loud As when grim spectres from their dungeons crowd, And hold deep converse on the skirts of heaven, While thunders rolling round their brows are driven. Againâagainâexplode the brazen jawsâ Lo, Death himself comes forward in the cause. Th' invading host are scatter'd on the flood, Which now turns sickly with their poisoning blood: So when innumerous sea-birds crowd the wave, Their glossy pinions in the deep to lave, An artful fowler sluggish leaves the shore, Cover'd with sea-weed in his light skiff o'erâ Sporting, the flocks no hidden danger dream, Till the quick flash comes brightening o'er the stream, Alarm'd, at once they dart upon the wind, Leaving their wounded and their dead behind. Thus break the Britons in disorder lost, Like Egypt's throne upon the Red-sea toss'd. Numbers to shatter'd bark with gripe of death, Grapple for lifeâhard labouring for their breath, Calling for succour! Lo, the Patriots hear, And bend their eyes not absent with a tearâ The generous Neale, supported by his band, Rescues their lives from washing with the sand! The act divine is register'd in heavenâ Fredonia thusâto proud emotions given: âNumber the sands wash'd white by chafing tideâ Yea, count the starry deities that ride In flaming chariots through the liquid sky, Loose on the ocean of immensityâ Speak the full numbers of this host of heavenâ Sum the live sparkles from the diamond givenâ When these are number'dâthenâbut not till then, Can I their deeds by flood and field explain. Night would close upon the dayâday would rise, And night return and darken round the skies, Ere that in vision would their actions roll, From east to westâfrom each divided pole!â This said, she paus'dâAnd Washington on high, To northern latitudes extends his eye To where in mourning Hartford sad appears, Wrapp'd in deep sableâweeping sorrow's tears: âWhy moves this solemn train in silence dumb? What sageâwhat patriot to his dust hath come? Mark how the banners sigh upon the breeze, The sight of which would make a mortal freeze. Anxious my bosom throbs. Celestial Maid, O say what hero on his bier is laid? How brief the longest date that mortals know! But death relieves the virtuous from their wo. Wolcott, perhaps hath render'd up his clayâ But why on earth his spirit doth delay? Well is he worthy to be rank'd the first With those who form the synod of the just.â âAlas, the theme!â Fredonia soft replies, While two rich tears hung trembling in her eyes; âGrief weighs my bosom down the truth to tellâ These scenes my heart with bitterness reveal. âYon drooping retinue thine eyes behold, Are patriots purified as seven times goldâ But ah, a leaden sorrow stoops their headâ They mourn the Charter of their Freedom dead! Fractur'dâalas! Ambition struck the blowâ And Faction follow'd to its overthrow. âCelestial man!ânow cast thine eye within The Hall of State, and mark where feuds begin,â Devising measures with corruptive pride, To loose the chainâthe Union to divide!â âNot fractur'd, possible!âcan it be so?â Thus Washington in grief:ââAlas the wo! Methinks my mortal lineaments I seeâ But O, how wander'd are their thoughts from me! I feel regret my image should be there, Lest it should catch some poison from the air.â âNot so, my son!â th' empyreal Fair replies With beauty kindling in her rolling eyes: âNo act of others can thy deeds defameâ Not e'en Pollution can besoil thy name. When mad Ambition holds unbridled sway, Virtue herself may darken for a day: So, when the face of heaven is cast with clouds, The sun his splendour for a moment shrouds, But soon the vapours gone,âhow pure, how bright, Shows he more lovely his unspotted light: So shall thy deeds forever live and shine, Like lamps replenish'd with an oil divine. âTo Boston blushing like a virgin dress'd In bridal robes,âseated on ocean's breast, Now cast thy vision forthâand there behold The passing scenes successive to unfold.â He bends his heaven-wash'd eye: Lo, Boston sweet, Comes dancing into view on silver feet. Her temples kiss the azure-vaulted sky, Tasting the sunbeams as they frolick by. The dome of state is arch'd the clouds above, As Chimborazo tops the mountain grove. The zephyr'd Mall extends embower'd with trees, Which soothing murmur to the passing breezeâ Where hand in hand the swain and virgin move, And tender whisper holy things of love. Now at the murderous spot, State Street, 1770. where Albion's band, First drew forth blood, which rous'd a suffering land, Gazing from heaven, lo, Washington descries A gorgeous train, that held him in surpriseâ With nodding plumes the infantry advance, Their streamers floating in a wavy dance. A thousand blushing youths in light robes new, With steps unequal on their rear pursueâ Their brows with garlands twin'd, and on their breast, His Farewell Legacy is seen to rest. Baskets of wicker-work their soft hands hold, Fill'd with selected flowers bedeck'd with gold, Breathing perfumes. Beyond this retinue, With flags of emblems glittering on the view, Their sires appear, bedeck'd with roses white, And like devotion, bearing him in sight. In silence Washington the scene beheldâ At length his tongue his rising thoughts reveal'd. âThis for the earth most splendid it appearsâ These honours to my name transport to tears! Were all my sons like these, how soon would cease Discord's mad voiceâthe nation smile in peace.â Thus he. Fredonia then: âNothing but showâ This is the fountain of the stream of wo. Yea, those who seem the worshippers of thee, Exalt the foeâdegrade their Libertyâ Her labours they importârevile their lawsâ Loan Albion wealth to prosecute the wars! Yesâthe Convention is upheld by thoseâ They every effort of the land opposeâ By Stygian rites they swear Washington Benevolent Society.âa recreant band, Who for vile gold would barter off the landâ Hypocritesâdissemblersâslavishâbaseâ The cause of all the warâa factious race. When victory elevates Columbia's power, They droop their traitor headsâlook sad and sourâ But when the Eagle from the Lion flies, A smile of pleasure brightens in their eyes! âTo thee 'tis waste of moments to declare, That simple virtue needs no tinsel glareâ While that hypocrisy will strive to hide His bosom dark with ornaments of pride. âNow elevate thine eyeâobserve Castine, And all the eastern shores of northern Maine, Bent in submission by the royal band, To awe the bleeding Patriots of the land, Till this Convention shall the hour decide, How, when, and where, the Union to divide!â Deep silence reign'd through heaven to mark the deedâ Yet still their greatest griefsâfarâfar exceed The purest bliss that mortal life can feelâ Or the rapt mind in holy thought reveal. Justice at length th' appalling silence brokeâ Astonish'd heaven stood listening while he spoke: âDays twice fifteen I yield this treacherous band, To join in union with their native landâ But should they yet, when grace expires, defend The cause of Britain, and her arms befriend, They to her tyranny shall bend the kneeâ Bound in the chains of iron slavery. âDuring this period thou wilt here remain, Fredoniaâand retaste th' ambrosial plain. And while these suns shall roll before their eye, Will pass such scenes as wring with agony. âBut Fame, 'tis thine to leave the courts of heaven, To bear the tidings as their souls are givenâ Or to aid Britain in th' unholy fight, Or be restor'd to Liberty and light.â Fame, like a starbeam passes down to earth, While the celestials to their bowers glide forthâ Silent their voicesâbut their plumes of gold, Echo sweet musick as they rise and fold. Soft on the breath of Deity they roll, Fill'd with the joys that satisfy the soul! CANTO XXXVI. HAMPTON. ARGUMENT. Invocation .... Cockburn's Spoliations in the Chesapeake. The scene is laid in sight of Norfolk, at Lewis, George, and Frederick townsâat Havre De Grace, and Hampton .... The time is eight days. Thou Flame of heaven which fires the poet's tongueâ Empyreal Genius of the epick song! Vouchsafe thy droppings on my breast to pour, As dew that cherishes the withering flower. Large let me drink of thy abundant springâ Sweet to my lips the vital waters bringâ My thirsty soul stands fainting to receive The crystal fount to make her thoughts to live: A weeping mother longs to clasp her boy, Torn from her arms in Albion's slave employâ A hunter lost amid Missouri's waste, Longs for the star of morning in the eastâ A traveller fainting in the desert sand, Longs for the lux'ry of a stream at hand,â But all their longings not with mine compareâ They weigh as gossamer in empty air. My flesh is wasting and my hollow eye Proclaims my blood in secret channels dryâ Come with thy fountain and revive my soul, Or these faint orbs no more in bliss will roll. Alas, what bliss is now in store for me? What bleeding cloudsâwhat midnight misery, Cataract my sight! Hampton!âO, 'tis thou, That binds death's fillet icy round my brow. Thou Spirit of my song! the bandage tight, Loosenâfreedom my soul, and give me light! What time the youthful Neale drove Cockburn back, The spoiler's soul was broken on a rackâ He rav'dâthen held his voiceâthen gnash'd his teeth, To mark the sinking of his host beneath. During two suns he wist not what to doâ Perplex'd what circumstance to next pursueâ Like a wave tossing in the sport of wind, So passion fever'd and disturb'd his mind. Thus tortur'd was his breast till day was tomb'd, And stars of blood the scatter'd clouds illum'd With crimson stain of dubious character, Which made them look though murderers' hands they wave! The Fiend emerging from a grave came forth, At tide low water, unobserv'd of earthâ The wretched tenant of the brine-drench'd tomb, Is he, whose promise plighted in life's bloom, He in the violence of faith betray'd, And brought of heaven the curse upon his head. The Power, infernal, rising from beneath, Pass'd through the watery chamber of his death, And with his tooth he gnaw'd upon his heart, Till at its core he found the rotten part, Which caus'd a hollow shrieking of the ghost, So dire, the monsters howling fled the coastâ This he effected in a serpent formâ Or more the likeness of a grave-yard worm. But alter'd now to Elliot's shape again, In a light skiff he cleaves it o'er the mainâ Cockburn, to visits to relieve his care, And from his thoughts to cast away despair. Reaching the vessel, suddenly he finds Himself surrounded by his former friends. Cockburn salutes him with a smiling browâ And while conversing they proceed below, Where Beckwith sat in agony of pain, To meet disaster for expected gain. âWhy stoop ye thus with boding thoughts depress'd? Give to the winds your griefsâlet Norfolk restâ Brood not o'er reckless scenesânew plans devise, And soon the Eagle of the city dies. âNow to my voice give heed: Your anchors weigh And for the Chesapeake your sails display. I a safe pilot will the squadron bear To all its villages to riot there. Consent to my designs, and not your fleet Will have the power to swim the valu'd freight. No Craney Island will your progress mar, For now propitious shines the morning star.â Sir Sidney smiles, and Cockburn pleas'd appears, For every word was musick to their ears. A flush of gladness passes o'er their cheek, To burn and ravage in the Chesapeake. Him, Cockburn answers: âElliot, take control, And lead where plunder may enrich my soul. Bitter despair my boding heart depress'd, But you have rais'd this burden from my breast. Direct us but to wealth, and lo, your name Will soon be mantled with a regal fame. âBut mark, the hours of night apace consumeâ The time demands to seize upon its gloom.â To either ship he these instructions gave: âWith silence heave the anchor from the waveâ And let each vessel in its sailing, turn By the live lamp upon the Marlborough's stern.â These brief instructions pass from ship to shipâ And soon the squadron cleaves the sable deep. Their spoiling standards flicker on the bay, As fade the stars before th' approaching day. The village Frenchtown, soon their view delights, And Cockburn presently his thoughts recites: âThrough choice have we from Norfolk bent our course, And not that we were overcome by force, But that their watchmen there should be on guard, Whilst unmolested here, we draw our sword. âAnchorâdrop bargesâwing them to the beachâ Ravage and seize the precious things in reach. Lo, this the favour'd moment to acquire WealthâPly the torch and brighten heaven with fire!â Forth at the licence given, th' unbridled band Dash through the watersâbound upon the landâ Ransack the village with relentless sway, And to their ships the plunder'd boon convey; Enter the fieldsâthe cultivater's all Hurl to the windsâthe oxen in the stall Welter in bloodâthe bleating flocks expireâ The treasur'd grain consumes with smouldering fire. Having at length a besom spread around, Smiling like fiends, they vanish'd from the ground. The morning next to Sassafras they steer, Where George and Frederick opposite appear. The wretched Cockburn, as he'd done before, Disbarks his legion to pollute the shore. But lo, bold Veasy with but twice fifteen, Checks for a time the progress of the scene. Full twice their number of the Vandals bleedâ But others crowding to their place succeed. Back from o'erwhelming ranks retire the brave, Yet frequent wheeling, they the foremost grave. Frederick becomes a theatre of woâ Mothers with infantsâvirgins, to and fro, Run pale and frantick with dishevell'd hair, While screams of horror shriek along the air. The dwellings desolateâthe tyger band, Whetted with rage, apply the kindling brand. The bickering flames mid darkening smoke arise, Religion's Bulwark hails the sacrifice! Cockburn, the Sassafras now crosses o'er, And lands his spoilers on the adverse shore, Where smiling George upon its bank is seen, All bright reflected in the wave serene. But lo, the hell-inspir'd the flames excite, Which as they kindle fill them with delight. Of either village cinders wheeling rise, And roll together in the burning skies. Deep night returns and dreary darkness reigns, Shrouding the sky, the ocean, and the plains; Spectres are seen like meteors in the air, Riding the waters with their blazing hair. By the red gleam th' infernal Pilot steers, While each by him with cautious bearing veers. At length, on Susquehannah's wave they ride, Where glad she ripples with the ocean's tide. Scarce had they touch'd the stream, when sounds of wo Were heard to labour from the deeps below; The joints of Cockburn shook the groans to hear, And all his navy trembled with their fear. âAnd what, I pray you, does this souund portend?â Thus Cockburn to the counterfeited Fiend: âI fear some dread convulsion is at hand, To gulph, or wreck our vessels on the strand! Perhaps some Craney Island gathering head, To mix our skulls with rocks of ocean's bed! I'll speak to round the helm nor farther goâ Listen! what means it?âominous of wo!â Cold his teeth chatter'd in his shivering jawsâ But soon the Fiend explain'd to him the cause: âAway this heartless thought, this terror weakâ And learn how obvious is the cause you seek: âKnow,âby this stream my mother brought me forthâ At opening spring such noises from the earth Frequent are heardâbut where the waters here Mingle,âthey strike more doleful on the ear. The ignorant apprehend that from beneath, Th' infernals rise, of air more pure to breathe. But we philosophers, by wisdom taught, Never regard such vacancy of thought: âPent airs collected in the womb of earth By winter's cold, at warming spring burst forth. Easy explain'd by philosophick lawsâ Sounds, th' effectâexpansion is the cause.â Erring he spoke. The deities around, Of Susquehannah, rais'd the mournful sound, The time they felt the navy's pressing weight, Burden'd with fiends the shores to desolate. The fears of Cockburn in his bosom died, When hell's philosopher with art replied; Who thus continu'd on: âHere on the west, Lies proud De Grace to be by flames depress'd. When day shall glimmer in the eastâbeginâ Assail the village and its treasures win; But when your soul is sated with desire, Then let the cinders to the heavens aspire.â Thus he. And Cockburn thus: âMy heart's close friend, As you advise, so I my views shall bend. And fear me not that I shall prove a child, To spare the village from destruction wild. âGenerous, with you shall I a share divide, A star shall glitter on your breast beside. Never without your guidance, could I find The booty rich to paradise my mind. Paradise!âI thought it neverâIn sooth, My simple mother taught it meâa youthâ I meant as happy as the Tempter felt, When Eve before him for an apple knelt. Having delighted thus th' Infernal's ear, This to each ship he sent by messenger: âLet untongu'd silence every Briton keep, While groans our every barge with weapons deep. When day shall glimmer on the eastern cloud, Explode the cannon and the mortars loud. Secure the treasuresâthen a besom spread, Till one wide ruin shall the land pervade. Yeaâlet the flames be mounted to the skyâ For lo, 'tis now the time for Royalty!â Swift at instructions given, his ruffian crew, The fell command with eagerness pursueâ Freighting with implements of war,âthe barge, Mortars and rockets on the town to charge, When on the skirted clouds the shreds of light Should gleamâand chase the shadows of the night. Hush'd is the village in their silence deep, Soft on the bosom of care-soothing sleepâ All but O'Nealâhe, zealous, and aloneâ A man of yearsâkeeps watch against the throne: Not otherwise a lion leaves his den, To guard in darkness the approach of menâ His whelps and lioness in peace behind, Rich in their dreamsâbosoms to bosoms join'd. This way and that he searches to descry The lurking dangers in obscurity, His senses on th' alarm he scorns surprise, Ready prepar'd his life to sacrifice: So Neal, the veteran, with unwinking ken, Watch'd like the lion jealous of his den. At length, the gleaming of the dawn appearsâ Exploding thunders deafen through the spheres. Rockets the clouds tinge sanguineâshells and ball In burning circles on the hamlet fall: As when a flock upon the dew-drop lawn, Press the soft flowers to lose themselves till mornâ Beside the ewes the tender lambkins lie, While gentle sleep pours slumber on their eye. The hovering deities that rule the hour, Touch the life-brain with fancy-working powerâ They dream of pastures deck'd with clover white, And seem to smile as grazing with delight. While dreaming thusâbehold!âa dismal yell Of ravenous wolvesâloud, horrible as hell, Astounds their ears! Alarm'dâfrenzied from rest, Wild they awake with death upon their breast! So matronsâtender infants, virgins fair, Wakenâdistracted, wilder'd with despair. They scream, wringing their hands in soul distress, Rending their hair in aching bitterness. Mothers delirious, with their offspring fly, Clasp'd to their bosomsârack'd with agony. Meantime O'Neal with fire, who volunteer'd, Planted a gun, and with it numbers clear'd. But Cockburn landing, soon the fire grew pale, And left the sage the foe to countervail. Yet full of heart he crowds the ballâand then, Plies the hot match and thins whole ranks of men. But lo, recoiling, it unpowers his thigh, Yet still he lingers on the enemyâ With glowing zeal he snatches in his hand, The cowards' weaponsâstreams them at the band: Thus when a thousand tygers bent on death, Assail a lion with convulsive teethâ Behold, th' unconquer'd monarch of the wood, Bristles his rageâinflames with fire his blood. Some groan their lastâbut press'd with numbers round, Sour he gives back,âslow, darkening o'er the ground. Thus Neal gave way. With patriotick tears, He strives to rouse the timid villagers: âAnd is there none inherited with mindâ Noneâthat their hearts the chords of valour bind To bow them to the dust? O, lost to shame! And shall thick infamy enshrine your name? Let me entreat you by your fathers' worth, Who now cold slumber in their beds of earth! By these thin hairs which silver o'er my head, Stand in your strength and make the foe recede. âList! to the shrieking of your infants' cries! Hark! hear what anguish screams along the skies! Your virgins,âwives,âthey beat their bosoms bare! Seizeâsnatch armsârushârescue from despair!â Vain his endeavoursâFearsâcold fears benumbâ They stand like sculptur'd stoneâhalf breathlessâdumb. But lo, they mark th' invading host draw nigh, And swift as wild things from resistance fly! Fierce like a whirlwind comes the spoiling crew, And drunk with hell, their cursed work pursueâ They burst th' abodes of peace with dÃ¦mons' tread, Like murder'd ghosts ascended from the dead. Th' unhallow'd booty to their ships convey'd, The whole in ashes by the torch is laid. A consecrated church where kneeling saints Pour'd with repentant tears their sorrowing plaints, Is swept in ruins by the fell command Of Cockburn to his violating band: âUp-turnââ But hold! Why should the Muse repeat Language to cause the soul with blood to sweat! Language more rude than fiends in hell employ, When they the damn'd with horrid speech destroy. As when the Stygian monarch once a year, To keep in memory his proud career, When he in secret enter'd Eden's bower, And stole from thence the amaranthine flower, Grants his chain'd subjects freedom to array, And spend the time in general holydayâ With joust and tournament the scene beginsâ And after which, exploding magazines, Convulse the battlementsâthen whirlwinds dire Made visible with flickering wreaths of fire. Are from their rocky prisonhouse unpent, Which onward dash with outrage violentâ While on their fiery skirts they screaming fly, Loud though the shriek were hell's last agency: Like this, the ruffian agents of the crown, Rush on and desolate the helpless town. Ravage the countryâarches tear awayâ Pillage the travellerâdisarrayâ Who?âwhy is it blank? That let England speakâ She dares not!âhell is burning in her cheek! Never a blush was seen to mantle there, Save that of guilt, when prov'd its character! Thus while the sun three revolutions made, They through the land a Vandal besom spreadâ But on the fourth they launch themselves away, Hearing of Stricker, marshall'd in array, With sword made bare, and vengeance in his breast, Their farther riot sudden to arrest. Swift through the waters of the bay they glideâ At eve, devoted Hampton is descried. As smooth the vessls tilted o'er the wave, Th' infernal Pilot these instructions gave To Cockburn, Beckwith: âLook, that spire in sight, Belongs to Hampton, to despoil at light. Soon as shall you yon bulwark overcome, And strip the Eagle of her lofty plume, Norfolk is thine! hunger will bend it down, And make it plead for mercy from the crownâ Thenâthen, a second time its flames shall riseâ And Cockburn's name and Dunmore's equalize!â Cockburn with smiling countenance, descried The Hampton village, and in turn replied: âWell, will I do the purpose you adviseâ Flames on the morrow from the town shall rise. âWhat splendid honours will the king bestow, Elliot on thee, when he thy worth shall know! To me, exceeding every price thou art, My guiding compass and directing chart. âSir Beckwith, you upon the rear will land, That we more ready may their force disbandâ Whilst with the floating batteries, shall I Deplume the Eagleâwrench it from the sky. âBut should they dare a desperate strife to hold, Then promise that, which maddens more than goldâ Beauty and Booty!âlet that theme be yours, And lo, a certain vict'ry it secures. Yes, I intend the ancient mode to tryâ The love-knot wreath of garlands to untie. âWhat say your thoughts? do you the plan approve? Love conquers all, and we must yield to love.â Here ceas'd he, damnable, with meaning look, And Beckwith, willing to his purpose spoke: âApprove!âfull long I've held the secret thought, That you've delay'd this measure to a fault. 'Tis true, that Europe in her wars of late, The fair enfranchise from a bondage stateâ And every tongue in this one language speaks, Save at the time that Trojans warr'd with Greeks. Was not the cause of Agamemnon's strife With stern Achilles, an allotted wife? And was not Greece with polish'd arts refin'dâ Stamp'd with proud virtues that adorn the mind? Hence, modern laws that disannul the right Of such fair honours to reward the fight, Is nothing binding on a warrior now, As every royal Briton will allow. âBut see, the squadron gains the anchorageâ Swift glides the time when we the strife shall wage. At the first tokens of returning dayâ Hence, we no longer can with words delay.â While Beckwith artful to the theme rejoin'd, In Cockburn's cheek a flush infernal shin'dâ At times, at each they cast a burning eye, Which flash'd more meaning than the tongue's reply. In pride of heart the ravagers withdraw T' arrange their plans to carry on the war, Then, to their rest they hiedâBut fancied bliss, Heating their blood with fiery happiness, Affrighten'd slumber from their feverish brainsâ Or if they doz'd, they dream'd of ravag'd plainsâ Of violationsâall the hateful brood Of hellish passions that inflame the blood. Day dawnsâand Beckwith's multitudes debarkâ Creation lowering with sad omens darkâ The sun slow labours through a field of blood, Whilst the unwieldly monsters of the flood Rise to the surface with a dubious roar, Which start the shrinking waters from the shore. Bleatings distressful from the flocks reboundâ The cattle bellow with a dismal soundâ Bears, wolves, and panthers in their caverns howlâ With solemn boding screams the mournful owl. The hideous spectres murder'd on the wave, Ascend in robes of blood and walk upon their grave. But lo, th' invading Britons disregard The ominous signsâso fir'd with the rewardâ Beauty and Booty!âhell incites them onâ They cast no thought upon the shrouded sun! Warriors four hundred, of Columbian mould, The profile fortress of the village hold. Crutchfield sustains the principal commandâ The next is Pryor, of artillery band. Servant, of infantryâCooper, of horseâ Compose the leaders of the infant force. Now when the enemy appear'd in view, Crutchfield, these words deliver'd to the few: âPatriots! the foe is landing on the shore! We'll strive to do what ne'er was done before. âServant, with secrecy your cohorts move To intercept their movements in the grove, Keep them in ambush, till they crowd so near, That every feature shall distinct appearâ Cooper, their left your cavalry will charge, While, Pryor, be it yours to sink their barge. âWe'll weld our souls in one to hold the ground, Till, or we die, or spend our every round. Keep fix'd in thought, that not for fame alone We now resist the violating throne: 'Tis to defend our Hampton from the brand Of these despoilers, that pollute the land. Strengthen'd by Justice strong our hearts will beat, When breast to breast the enemy we meet. Brace every nerveâand each his ten will brave, And fit them ready for the opening grave. âForth to your stations hieâBehold, the foe Darkens the waters! Deeds of valour show!â Servant and Cooper, with unsounding feet, Advanceâtheir warriors near the path secreteâ Their ready arms deep charg'd with triple shot, Obscur'd till death-fire should reveal the spot. While plann'd was this defence,âthe ruffian crew With chain of barges rounded into view Of Pryor's battery at the water's edge, Each crowding each though press'd in solid wedge. Superior vessels give the barge support, To render desolate the town and fort. Lo, now at signal given, th' invaders pour Balls, bombs, and rockets to consume the shore. Crutchfield gives caution thus: âYe heroes brave, Our globes are number'dâhence, with prudence save, Nor open on them till yon point they gain, Then touch the sparkle to the flashing grain. âThey comeâthey round the point! With judgment aim! Scatter the host like Pharaoh's on the stream!â The vents receive the match, and burn with deathâ Twelve barges struggle for their life beneath. With eyes stretch'd wide on ocean's bed they lie, Their vital bubbles rising as they die. Cockburn endeavours to proceedâin vainâ His barge-boats shiver'd, settle in the main. His broken squadron from th' explosions hie, Rounding the shoreâwhere they their engines plyâ Their rockets hiss aloftâtheir mortars burst, Fighting the air, or ploughing up the dust. Deep on the rear the ranks of Beckwith crowd With flaunting standards choking up the road. Reckless they come. Lo, Servant gives the sign! At once, a secret fire inflames the lineâ The horse of Cooper rush upon their flankâ They pauseâthey giveâthey faulter in their rank. But soon relock'd, they press with numbers strongâ Still Servant, Cooper, brave the numerous throng. Now at the battery, when the patriots heard The muskets pealing loud and clashing sword, Crutchfield to Pryor thus: âWith three times ten, The cannon holdâyour chosen-hearted men. I must awayâNot Cockburn moves again, Till that his rear shall occupy the plainâ Hence, I to Servant's aid the rest shall leadâ And our defence let human not exceed.â He wheel'd the instant he express'd his mind, Leaving with Pryor thirty names behind. With Servant soon and Cooper's horse he joinsâ Wedded they stand and check the Albion lines. Beckwith beheld and kindled in his rage, That thus a remnant should his powers engage, And block the pass, and hold him at a bayâ While many a lofty head was bow'd to clay. âWhatâdo the pulses of your life's blood fail, That you thus willing in submission quail? Behold the spoils! how tempting to the sight! Then why this dastard cowering from the fight? Beauty and Booty! What, renounce the prize To which your very souls should idolize? Beauty! ah, listen! hear you not the word? Then rush and win the garland with the sword!â Hell ton'd his voice. Like powder cast in fire, It flam'd their blood-veins to a mad desire. They rush'd a whirlwind on the patriot band, Who like a pyramid of brass withstand The fierce assault. Blood from their bosoms gushâ They fall, and tramping feet their bodies crush. But lo, th' inflaming dust of war is spent! They rush with steel and plunge it violentâ And while the foe stands check'd, they slow retireâ A cloud exhausted of its tempest fire. When the fiend Cockburn from his covert, saw Beckwith's division bending to the war, He made his second move: âDash, barges, now! And presently behold their standards bow! Fresh is the rose just opening to the sunâ Does not your blood in dancing measures run? Plant but the royal flag upon the beach, And lo, their charms will be within your reach! His language burnt upon their hearts. The oar They snatch'd, and dash'd their barges from the shoreâ But when unshelter'd from the point again, The brass of Pryor drove them in the mainâ The number ocean-wreck'd was twelve and sevenâ And still th' explosions o'er the deep are driven. But who upon his rear are darkening seen? Beckwith's advance with triumph on their mien! The Pryor band are ready to resign, And yield as captives to the pressing line. But Pryor's soul is strength: âThe cannon spike! Neverânoânever to the Vandals strike! Bareâbare the sword!âcharge through the thick array, And do an act to live in future day!â The vents are chok'd with steel. With corded heart, Wielding their falchions on their foes they dart. Blood gushes from their breasts. Their way they hew, And wave a flag defying on their view! The royals scarce the circumstance believeâ For full twice thirty of their band they grieve! So, when a boy, at Hadley Falls I've stood To mark the fishers circle on the flood, Casting their net to take the silver shadâ Their every bosom palpitating glad. Gathering the toils they find a numerous shoal, And all are eager to secure them whole. Lo, in the act to toss them on the beach, Through the stretch'd seine a salmon darts a breach! The captive shad rejoicing crowd the pass, And leave the fishers to bemoan their loss: So Pryor led the wayâhis band pursu'dâ So in despair the gloomy Britons stood. Cockburn now bounding, riots every houseâ And on their spoils his hell-loos'd fiends carouse. The dÃ¦mons seize upon the trembling fairâ Hark! to the scream! the dying shriek!âthe prayer! They pray upon their knees! Sun-darkening scene! They pray to devils in the shape of men. Their snowy bosoms pant upon the dust! Hell would turn back!â What ails my sight? 'tis dark! Eternal God! Loose my heart's bondage! Curdled is my blood! What felt the Muse? the tooth,âthe pang of death! Darkness breaks off,âpartial she feels her breath. Where hath she wander'd?âwhere? O ghastly dream! To think the thought would blind the solar beam! She thought rank devils from hot hell were seen, Staining the earth with violation's mien! The vision vanishethâstrike blind mine eye! The dream's no dreamâa damning certainty! O Albion! where's thy blush?ânot one is seenâ And have thy sons no attribute of men? A thousand different ways our virgins moanâ Our anguish'd matrons utter groan for groan. With their scarr'd infants shrieking on their breast, They plunge into the wave to find their restâ But ah, to them that luxury is deniedâ For worse than death they snatch them from the tide! And is there noneâno lofty Briton nigh, To check the outrageâheave one pitying sigh? No Brockâno Grayâno humane Reynolds near, To frown upon the shame and shed one generous tear! Not one!! O could there oneâbut one be found, How would the Muse delight his name to sound! O, she would call on those immortal given, T' inspire her soul with something rich from heaven, That a new rapture might inflame her tongue To shout his praise in a celestial song! Noneânone appears!âthe highestâlowestâall Partake alike the hellish festival! Cockburn had enter'd Kerby's sad abode, While fainting, dyingâebb'd away his blood. His weeping wife stood o'er him press'd with years, And his fair daughterâlovely in her tears. The tyger seiz'd the virgin as she stood, Weeping her sire! She screamsâshe prays to God! The dying Kerby waken'd from the dead, Wild like a ghost, and as in frenzy, said: âWhat fiend hath burst his prison-house?âWretch! Hell opens to receive thee! Could I stretch This armâAlas, I feel my death!â âThy looks how fell! Thy features prove thee risen out of hell! Life rushes on my soul! My heart!ââ âNo more!â The voice of Cockburn through the dwelling tore. Lo, as he spoke, the finish'd monster drew His belted arms, and flam'd the aged through! But ah, the passing scene had dried his blood, Just as his bosom lodg'd the fiery load! His wife in wild distraction beat her breast, And tore her hoary locksâthe fiend address'd: âWho hell unbarr'd and gave you power to rise, To bring upon the earth new agonies? My husbandâO,âalas! it is his blood! Daughterâwhere am Iâwhere? Give help, O God!â Cockburn, the other planted to her breastâ Shivering she fell, and gasp'd herself to rest! Tyger, their faithful dog, with piteous cry, Grieves for their fate, tears trickling from his eye. With solemn mien he moves around the dead, And makes vain efforts to support their head. He licks their bleeding wounds and strives to stay Life's crimson fountain, oozing cold away. To crown the massacre, their dog is laid, Sever'd in parts by Cockburn's murderous blade! Where runs my thought? A madness tears my brain! My stifled heart is bursting with its pain. And do I breathe and live? Heart!âbreak and dieâ Not death more firm will ever chain mine eye. Cockburn! Avaunt! A fiend from hell must rise Of blackestâvilestâdamn'dest infamies, Thy soul to equal!âSoul!âno soul hast thouâ The work of hell is written on thy brow! CANTO XXXVII. UNION OF THE STATES. ARGUMENT. The Fiend retires to the centre of the Earth .... Cockburn sails to the mouth of the Petapsco .... Union of the States .... Destruction of the Infernal Powers. The scene is laid in different parts of New-Englandâin the centre of the Earth, and in Heaven .... The time is suppos'd to be about thirty days. The Fiend, though frequent had he heard the sighsâ The groans, the shrieks,âthe wailing miseries Of souls in torment chain'dâand heard them toss On waves of surging fire, calamitousâ Beheld the dragons break the skulls, and crash The jointed bones, and piecemeal tear the flesh Of those, dark cavern'd in the vault of death, And seen them suck their brains in hell beneathâ Yet Cockburn's infamies so far excel These deep damnations of the blackest hell, His eye turn'd backâhe sicken'd at the sight, And like a vapour vanish'd into nightâ Beneath the earth where his infernal train Were at their toil, preparing the machine T' explode the States, should, final, they deny To bow their necks at feet of Royalty. During the dismal period that the sun Twice o'er the firmament his chariot run, Cockburn his desolating work pursu'd, To which no scene can bear similitudeâ But on the third a peal of thunder roll'd, Which to his heart like voice of judgment toldâ Partial recovered from the wrath of heavenâ (A punishment severe for discord given) He fled astounded,âto the ocean driven. On the same eve he anchor'd at the shore Of the Petapscoâstream of Baltimoreâ Ready, when Cochrane's navy should arrive From the Bermudas, on the town to drive. The second character of Cockburn's host, Beckwithâconveys the tidings to Prevost, Who down from Montreal began to guide His thousands forth in military pride To humble Yorkâhis object being first, Plattsburg to bend a victim in the dust. While this was passing, Hardy left Castine, Rich in his hope, Connecticut to gain, For its Convention gave him hope to think, They'd broke in twain the Union's golden linkâ And now off Stonington, for war complete, He apprehends the Eagle at his feet. Th' unholy Conclave had their purpose laid, Where the New-Albion Empire should be madeâ Alas, the stabbing treason of the strokeâ Linking the fetters which their fathers broke! Their fell intentions on the parchment seal'd, They rise and loose the massive bars that held The prisoning door, which hid their workings dark, That none their secret purpose might remark. Lo, as the hinges open with a creak, They hear of Cockburn in the Chesapeakeâ Of Ross approaching with a cloud at hand, In Cochrane's fleet to overspread the landâ Of Prevost's movements to reduce the State Of Yorkâand sweep its cities desolateâ With features turning pale, they hear the gun Calling to armsâHardy at Stonington! They close again the doorâA solemn pause Shuts every tongueâtheir selfish treason thawsâ Their blood runs backward at th' appalling news, That on themselves their friends Britons. should bend their views: Thus of a home-bound vessel on the sea, Bearing the flag and name of Unityâ Part of her crew with envious hearts possess'd, Fell mut'ny rankling in their every breast, Lurking, retire in secret to devise Unlawful means to make the ship their prize. In a close covert at the vessel's keel, From every eye their purpose they conceal. A sickly taper in a lantern dark, Shows on the face of each a murderer's markâ Their haggard features glar'd with light, look dread, Like lowering ghosts that hover round the dead. From ear to ear in stifled whispers low, The plan is laid to strike the butchering blowâ They prick their bosoms at the heart:âwith blood They print their names to make their promise good. Behold, they hear the crashing of a mast, And feel the vessel breaking with the blast! Th' ingulphing storm dissolves their treasons darkâ They rise the deck to save the sinking bark: So had the Conclave plann'd with bolted door To make their country bleed at every poreâ But when the danger to themselves was brought, They felt the tempest and renounc'd their faultâ They rose to save their arkâthe Ship of State, Ready to bilge upon the rock of fate. No pledge of justice can they hope from those, Britons. Who the best virtues of the heart opposeâ In whose fair smiles deceitful passions lurkâ In friendship's borrow'd guise plunging a hidden dirk. Their blindness o'er, their dangerous feud they see, To strike themselves, and root their Libertyâ Ah, and the chains of slavery behold, Forg'd out by Discord of Britannick gold. They hurl the written parchmentâtheir disgrace, In flames oblivious, and their deeds retraceâ Humbledârepentant of their treacheries past, Virtuous they rise to quench the civil blast. With this intent they publish far and near, Their motives undisguis'd, that all might hear: âFriends, fathers, brothersâborn of Freedom's soil! Listen in meeknessâhush contentious broil! Well nigh have we our liberties destroy'dâ In foulest deeds our guilty hands employ'd. No secret sin will we in thought conceal, But all the darkness openly reveal, That the full nation may believe us just, That we of wickedness repent in dust: âFor years twice seven we've rail'd with slanderous voice Against the Rulers of the People's choiceâ Assum'd the hypocriteâbrought Religion in To aid our factious and rebellious sinâ Britain, the Bulwark of our Faith proclaim'd, The simple virtues of our land defam'dâ Yea, with our wealth supported Albion's cause, And plead injustice to these righteous warsâ Declar'd that no essential injury, By her was done, by slaving on the seaâ Smil'd with fell joy when she the vict'ry gain'd, E'en when that Hull the nation's honour stain'dâ Abus'd the shade of Washingtonâhis name Join'd with Benevolence t' increase the flameâ LawrenceâO cruel thought!âwe branded vile, With murderâah, and spoke it with a smile!â Yet still, the crime the worst that bleeds the heartâ The frenzied crimeâto rend the States apart! âThese sins, and others of a crimson dye, We've mad committed with impunityâ But now, repentant in the dust we bend, And never more our nation's flag offend. âPatriots! New-Albions! cast your eyes abroad! Are we not compass'd with a flaming sword? The shores invaded by a ruthless band To wrap in fire the cities round the strand? Dark from the north a swarming army pours To chase the light of freedom from our shores, And tread our necks beneath their tyrant powersâ MaineâMaine, behold, in their possession lies! From this dead lethargy ariseâarise! Unite! To arms!âthe swordâthe helmet on, With which your fathers in their glory shone! Their hallow'd bones lie restless in their graves, To mark their children slanderers, traitors, slaves! The voice of Warren cries from Bunker's Height: ââForbear contentionsâfor the cause unite!â Hear, and obey his voice! Disunion, ceaseâ Heart lock'd to heart we win a glorious peace! âDeep with our richest blood we fix our sealâ Gird, gird to arms! Your fathers' worth reveal!â Here each of the Convention set his name To quench the burning of the civil flame, Which they themselves had kindled in the land, And made each bosom like a lighted brand: Cabot, and Hillhouse, Otis, Prescott, Dwightâ Swift, Goddard, Sherman, Treadwell, Smithâblue lightâ Lyman, Longfellow, Waldo, Dana, Wildeâ Lyman againâRhode-Island's hapless child. Bliss, Baylies, Hazard, Marston, Olcott, Westâ Wood, Dunham, Hallâforever to be hiss'd, And Goodrich, Bigelow, with traitors to be plac'd: These are the names which form'd the felon band That hurl'd the civil wild-fire through the landâ Yet credit we'll return for every deedâ Repentant infamy gains virtue's meed; They quench'd the discord which their madness flam'dâ The States New-Albion to their rank reclaim'd: As, or by accident, or from the flint, Fretted to life, sparkles on flax imprint The kindling rudiments which o'er it streak, Like hair-thread lightnings in a wanton freakâ And now, in circles runs the flickering fireâ And now, the flashes brighten and retire. In frolick thus the flame a moment plays, And then in volume quickens to a blaze: Like this, their language burnt from breast to breastâ New-Albion rises with new thoughts impress'dâ Marshals her host in bristling armour strong, And strikes the banners of the foe along. Back from her presence Britain flies the shores, Fearing to meet the rising of her powers. Hardy, from Stonington in shatter'd plight Retiresâhis bosom in a cloud of night. His ships are burning by the balls made redâ The waves are crimson'd with his bleeding dead. Meantime th' infernals in the central earth, Incessant toil'd to bring their engine forthâ Iron and sulphur from deep pits, pil'd round, Which with their feet impalpable they ground. Nitre, bitumen, to the mass they join'd, As had their monarch in his plan design'dâ Next they collected many a lightning chain, And them they pulv'ris'd fine as sand-beach grain. This doneâthey fashion'd thunderbolts, to make The land of Freedom from its basement shake. While thus employ'd were numbers in brigade, Others a furnace of vast compass made, Distant, beneath the opening at the pole, Through which the smoke in many a spongy roll, Fire-ting'd, like storm of midnight clouds,âpour'd forth, Which in deep darkness settled round the earth, Which Parry mark'd in frozen parallel, And since proclaim'd the outward verge of hell. Lo, now th' monarch in his towering height, Full fifty cubits, with proportion'd might, The forge approachesâliquifies a rock, And moulds a tube huge as an ancient oak, Which for two hundred winters had withstood The howling north wind and the beating flood. In melted ore he dips the nether end, His lips the other holdâhis lungs distendâ Swelling his cheeks he through the rock-pipe blows, And soon a globule of small compass shows.â Slow it increasesâtill at length, its size Of vast extent is subject of surpriseâ Huge in circumference as a mountain peak, Round which th' infernals in their gambols shriek, Cheering the Fiend. At length, with water cold, Sudden applied, the tube forsakes its hold, Which in the centre leaves a ready vent To fill the engine to its full extent. When ready for the match, the monarch thus Explains his future purpose, emulous: âFull brief Our labours on the earth are done, For soon the States are either lost or won. Should other means prove vain, this earthquake vast Will into ruins the Republick cast. âBut late Our purposes so brilliant speed, Our hope is strong without it to succeed. The acts of Cockburn, Proctor's far excelâ He wastes the earth more dire than fiend from hell. But jealous prudence cautions Us to guard, Lest future circumstance oppress Us hard,â Hence, to the centre roll the engine forth, Ready at signal to destroy the earth.â They heard the summons,âand with ghastly grin, Begun with labour vast to roll the huge machineâ But lo, an agent through the pit descends, And, terrified, salutes the king of fiends: âMonarch of monarchs! proudest name in hell! Forbear thine anger at the news I tellâ To stay their falling off was past controlâ Spare me thy rage,ânor scorpion-lash my soul!â âSpeak out! Proclaim it loud! Why dream of harm? Lo, we stand breasted for the worst alarm, Which earth or heaven can raise! What, has the South Been wrench'd from Cockburn's grasp? Ere that thy mouth Utter'd the sound did We the same forebodeâ Straighten thy knee? The magazine explode!â âNot soâYet O, forbear! Alas, for us! As slight disease to pestilential curse! Allâall, yea, allâour every friend is goneâ Our every prospect of a triumph done! Lo, the Convention hath our hopes deceiv'd, Which as impossible I at first believ'd. New-Albion weds Virginiaââ âStayâ Muffle your tongue, or crumble into clay! Rather had We this sceptre from Our hand, Had been despoil'dâhurl'd from Our high command! New-Albion wedsâ âShe gave Our cause its birth! What, lost a kingdom on the ball of earth! âSinkâbury with the earthquake!âmatch-fire light! And let creation darken into night! Put forth! But hold!âsmother the match, till We Shall learn the cause of this their treachery.â âIs this Our wisdom? O, We might have known, That they to kings this treason would have shown! Lo, in the war of Revolution past, By false allurements was Britannia cast! Yesâwell might We have understoodâ âNo moreâ Stand with the match till We the cause explore.â He spread his midnight wingsânor time delay'd, But nice in air his cumbrous balance weigh'd. Broad as he swept the heavy airs around, They groan'd like anguish though they felt a wound. Swift through the pit above the mount he roseâ And, cover'd with a cloud, he mark'd his foes. Dismay'dâhe kenn'd them in their armour bright, Resolv'dâunshaken in the righteous fightâ Yet partial hope reliev'd his sinking soul, When Prevost he beheld, like darkness, roll His thousands to the south. Rapid he spread His sable wings and round the army sped, To scan what succour he could give the force, The States to sunder from the Hudson's source. Such vast of numbers listed to his will, Not small his hopes his purpose to fulfil. While this transpir'd, with golden clouds array'd, Fame to the sphere of heaven the news convey'd. She met Fredonia on the wallâand near, Justice and Vict'ry with inclining ear. âLet anthem melody seraphick ring! Tidings of musick to your ears I bring! Rescu'd is Freedom from Infernal wiles! Bedeck'd with garland robes bless'd Union smiles! The monster Discord strangles in the dust! On wings of Liberty ascend the just!â Her trumpet ravish'd heaven! From all the host, Innumerable as sands on ocean's coast, A shout resounded so divine and shrill, That Echo answer'd from each heavenly hill: âColumbia rises from her crouching kneeâ Virtue, bless'd Freedom,âUnion, proud Liberty!â The full creation heard the rapturous strainâ The stars of heaven repeated it again! Justice, at length, unfolds his knitted browâ And these reflections from his bosom flow: âPleasnre like wine intoxicates the brain, And binds proud Reason in a slavish chain, Which, if its links be gold, her votaries feel, And groan beneath its weight though fashion'd hard of steel. Pleasure's an adder of a glossy shine, To lure and sting the essence soul divine: But when Adversity weighs down the breast, Sinking the heart with anguish-load depress'd, Lo, truant man to Virtue swift returnsâ And Reason's lamp within his bosom burns. Adversity refines the soul from dross, As gold from fire receives a brighter gloss: âThus the Columbians at the north and east, Drank the full cup, and eat of Pleasure's feastâ Soft Luxury, fed by Commerce, bow'd them low, And made them kneel obsequious to the foeâ But through Adversity refin'd they rise, And wed with Unionâgrateful to the skies! âFame, now reveal where dwells the hidden Power, For I proclaim that this, his final hour. âThus when that man shall bend his wandering eye To Virtue's light, the Attributes on high Will give him succour to forsake his mire, And form his heart to newness of desire. Such is the state of all with earth imbu'd, That they must feel a passion to be good, Ere messengers descend unseen, to raise Their souls, made callous by their hardening ways.â Fame answers Justice: âIn the central sphere Of earth, is now th' infernal Characterâ Late hath he fashion'd by his hellish art, An engine dire to rend the States apart!â Forth when the Goddess of the trump was done, Justice to Freedom's guardian Power, begun: âNow is it thine, Fredonia, to descend, And roll destruction back upon the Fiend. Fame, Victory, to guard the threaten'd land, On the bright circle of th' equator standâ Your influence sacred, will preserve entire The earth uninjur'd, 'gainst his utmost ire. With adamant, Fredonia, shut the pole On which the north star shinesâthen, swift his soul, Keen with thy spear pursue, whose point of fire, Will drive him to the pit, or by its touch expire.â Fame, Victory, meteorous to th' equator flew, Swifter than eye could glance on object new. The earth in homage kiss'd their angel feet, When light they touch'd her verdant bosom sweet. The same brief instant, with her vital spear, Fredonia stood upon the northern sphereâ She circled with its point the opening wide, And to the Earth with voice commanding cried: âClose up!âand be thou clos'd!â The Earth obey'dâ (Such was the virtue of the heavenly Maid.) Reeling it shook, and would its balance lost, And loose, from star to star been tumult-toss'd, Had not the Goddess with her spear upheld The sinking pole:âSmooth on again it wheel'd Round its vast orbit to return the year, And bring the seasons in their proud career. Now when th' Empyreals from the wall sublime Descended swift to the terrestrial clime The Fiend with terror mark'd their bright descent, And to the mountain back his progress bentâ A moment hover'd o'er the pitâand then, Darted beneathâand join'd his hell within. âThunder the earthquake!âlet the flames arise! The Powers celestial have forsook the skies! And felt you not the jarring of the earth? Some dire event is hastening into birth! Ruinârevenge is Ours! The dull match ply, And while it burns, beyond the mountain fly!â The match, by gnashing of their teeth they light, Then wheeling upward with a rushing flight, Dart for the pit t' escape the earthquake dire, While slow and smouldering creeps the lazy fire. Fredonia having shut the pole, flew south, And saw the monarch hovering o'er the mouth Of earth's infernal chasm. Like heaven, she stands On its rough edge, as wild the hellish bands Flaming arise! The brilliance of the Fair, Makes their strength rottennessâstruck with despair, Back they recoil and down the dungeon roll, Like broken clouds of midnight from the pole. The Tyrant linger'd on their rear behindâ Not had he rose,âand thus with desperate mind: âWherefore is this?âexplain this frenzy?âwhy Thus look ye thunderstruck, and blinded lie? Wakenâarise!âsoon will the engine burst! Bestirâbe up!âin Me, your Sovereign trust. Arm for the combat, arm! Not hell, not earthâ Not heaven itselfâwhen mail'd to issue forth, Can stay Our might! The moment is the last! Arm, and storm heaven, or die beneath the blast!â They rise,âthey arm, as he in thunder saidâ So terrible the sight they start the dead. Some grasp the crooked lightning in their handsâ Some, rocks rough torn and hugeâsome, flaming brands. Others snatch globes of kindled brimstone direâ And some, through madness, spit hell-flashing fire. A new-forg'd thunderbolt the Fiend wields high, Vast, like a mountain, with its oaks sing'd dry. His eye caves bend on death. Cold round each ball Brown adders, druling poison, wreathing crawl. Thus in his terror clad, he upward wheels, With hell in arms ascending at his heels. Fredonia held the pass!âwhen near at hand, She wav'd her spear and utter'd this command: âThou gloomy author of Columbia's woâ Thine hour hath come! Smother thy head below. Despair of hope to longer taste the airâ Goâplunge to hell, and reign, and triumph there!â His smother'd passion kindles to a blazeâ His stature swelling, terrible displays A shape without a form. His iron tongue, In peals of thunder to the Goddess rung: âWho bids us triumph in the midst of fire? Thy threats are windâand heaven's excited ire! Thy head prepare, to smother it below! To bear thee from Our wrath thy wings are slow!â This having said, the thunderbolt he hurl'd, But lo, obliquely from her feet it whirl'd. âSink to the shadesâto death!ââGlancing her spear Lights on his boiling breast, a pang severe Enter'd his heart! He groans in hideous moodâ His foaming jaws spout cataracts of blood. His snaky hairs erect themselves with ire, Mad, like the sparkles of electrick fire. With torment rack'd, he bites the flinty rock, Grinds it to dustâthe mountain feels the shock. His hard-strain'd eyeballs ooze a Stygian goreâ His heart convuls'd, is cracking at its core. His boiling brains are mix'd with scorpions full, Which burst his head, and twine around his skull. He breathes a cloud of death! The sun gives backâ The moon, the stars, their course in heaven retrack, Nature eclips'd though judgment day had come To rouse the sleeping tenants of the tomb. The pain at last makes weakness of his strengthâ Headlong he plungesâall his monstrous length, Crushing his subject powers beneath his weight! In vain they strive to shun th' impending fateâ Explodes the earthquake with convulsions dire! Hell fills the earth! A solidness of fire Pours through the opening southâThe slumbering dead Turn in their graves, as starting up with dread! The anguish'd bosom of the Earth sweats blood, But Fame and Vict'ry on its circle stood And kept the groans within! The Infernals fly, Broken in parts, to hell eternity! The turbulence hath pass'dâFair shines the sunâ Like lovers, hand in hand the planets run, Rejoicing round his beams. Sweet on the mountain's brow, Bends with delight the many-colour'd bow. The Powers celestial on the glorious even, With songs of triumph wing their way to heaven. CANTO XXXVIII. BATTLE OF PLATTSBURG. ARGUMENT. Prevost invades New-York .... Macomb is supported by volunteers .... Skirmishings .... A night Scene ... Macdonough's Victory ... Prevost defeated. The scene is laid on the borders of Lake Champlainâin Plattsburg, and at the river Saranac ... The time is seven days. The time that Cockburn ravag'd on the coast, York to invade, progressive mov'd Prevost: A train innumerous to his rule was given, Deep, red, and vast, like crimson'd clouds of heaven. Five chiefs of lofty port marshal the bandâ De Rottenburg, the second in commandâ Baynes, Kemp, and Brisbane, Robertson, and Powers, Bedeck'd with plumes and artificial flowers, Their banners glittering to the sun unfold, As they invasion of the lake-path hold. Soft on the bosom of Champlain, the fleet Follows the army with its strength completeâ Now, in the foliage hidâand now the sun Brightens the sails and glads its journey on. Downie directs its movement through the waveâ At Cape Trafalgar honour'd with the braveâ Confiance bears his flag, of nine, fifteenâ Pring rules the Linnet, mounting six and tenâ The Chub and Finch, of brass eleven eachâ And thirteen barges glide along the beach:â Nine tens and five the compliment they bear, And mortars ready to inflame the air. Now at the village of Champlain they halt, None doubting victory at the word, Assault! Oblique disdain disfigures every eye, That seems to speak a death to Liberty. When day in clouds return'd, Sir Beckwith came From the Petapsco, infamous in fame, And thus to Prevost, heâinferiors, near, Inclining forward rivetted to hear: âProud shield of RoyaltyâColumbia's grave! We've done the purpose at the southern waveâ Cockburn, made able by my conquering train, Has scath'd with fire the borders of the main. The fields swept desolateâtheir wealth secur'd, And bent the whole obedient to the sword. The towns, and villages, the torch devour'dâ The fire-scorch'd Eagle in his presence cower'd. âOf late we parted at Petapsco shore, Below, five leagues, the city Baltimore. When, from Bermudas, Cochrane shall arrive, Then forth will they a demonstration drive. Ross will conduct the veteran legions on, And dash their Star-gemm'd standards from the sun. âWhen they the city there shall conflagrate, Then, they design proud York to demonstrate. Ascend the Hudson streamâyour banners join, Sunder New-Albion from the southern line.â Prevost approv'd with pleasure in his eye, And in half whisper utter'd this reply: âBeckwith, thy words my heart with gladness fillâ But for the present let your thoughts be still. Here, at the north, we promise smooth and fair, Nor our intentions breathe upon the air. With tardy progress have I mov'd my powers To hear of Cockburn ravaging the shores. Soonâin the compass of an hourâa blow Reduces Macomb to conditions lowâ And, of Macdonough's fleet if truth I learn, They must resign, or in explosion burn. Downie, in strength is equal five to three, With chosen sailors tried on every sea.â This said, they part: And Prevost issues forth This Proclamation through the east and north: âListen, O York!âattend, New-Albion, round! And give due credence to my words profound! âTo those, who pant for peace, no dread I bringâ Rest, rest shall they, beneath my hovering wingâ Such the protection promis'd by my king. Cast back your fears at my invasion nowâ Remain at homeâyour happy vallies plough. Behold, I've come those vales in peace to guard From wicked men, whose tongues for war cry hardâ Yeaâfrom your frenzied Government, unjustâ From Madison, Monroe, with sins accurs'dâ From all who aid this most unnatural fight, To rob Britannia of her ancient right To rule the oceanâthose, and only those, Whom we invadeâthe cause of all your woes! âReceive thy friends, New-Albion! glorious name! Come, join thy parent, and she'll nurse thy fame! 'Tis forty summers since you scorn'd her grace, But O, returnâshe'll nurture you with peace! The simple manners of Democracy, Have long been grating to a soul like thee. The scarfs, the garters, and the ribands blue, Will show your distance from this grovelling crew! The Rich and Well-born should distinctions know, To mark their names from herding numbers low! âBe bound no longer by these equal laws! I've come to make you noble in the cause! Come to protect you in your titles bless'd, Against the war-States of the South and West! âI've heard your voice crying for Moses' hand, To lead you happy to the Promis'd Land! Lo, I to you will now a Moses proveâ These vile Egyptians and their yoke remove! Your land shall flow with honey, wine, and milkâ In fine-spun garments of the softest silk, Your wives, your virgins in their pride shall dressâ Your vines and fig-trees yield you happiness. An Aaron Priesthood future shall be thine, To make you holy as the stars that shine! âThese honours shall be yoursâbut join my hostâ Your Moses callsâprotector, friendâ âPrevost,â This manifesto flew the country round,â It op'd afresh the nation's closing wound. New-Albion saw her feuds had lur'd the foe T' invade the country with deceptious showâ By one part rag'd, the other to subdue, Till bleeding Freedom bade the world adieu. Their eyes with tears of gratitude, to heaven They rais'dâthat Union to the land was given. While these events were passing, Macomb's power Strove in their strength for the invading hour. Forts Scott, Moreau, and Brownâby patient toil Were rais'd in posture to defend the soil. Plattsburg preparing for the soon attack, Removes afar, beyond the Saranac, Its silver-headed sires, its infants smallâ Its mothers, virgins, and its sacred all. Each several day squadrons on squadrons pour From different States to strengthen Macomb's powerâ Their bosoms beating vita! in the cause Their soil to rescue from the Lion's jaws. With patriotick Mooers, the sons of York, In armour brighten for the glorious workâ Starks' Mountain-offspring gather from afar, Proud as bold eagles to the scene of war: Thus bees, when clustering in the time of May, Hang round the hive beneath the sunny ray, Waiting the signal of their queen to rise, To seek new shelter from inclement skiesâ Behold, she darts upon a sightless wing! With sudden rush, hoarse-sounding, buzzing, sing Her subjects as they flyâblackening the day With crowding millions in their swarming way,â Or as wild doves in flocks of numbers vast Fly forth in autumn in pursuit of mastâ Broad compassing the heavens in arch they bend, From east to west, as far as eyes extend. Scarce these like rushing winds pass flickering by, When others rising, blacken o'er the skyâ These soon in distance vanish less and less, And other multitudes the sight oppressâ Another flock appearsâand others riseâ To gaze the whole would blind the strongest eyes: So from the hills the sons of patriots pour, To guard their birthright from invading power. Macomb beheld with inspiration's glow, The warriors gathering like the ocean's flowâ But presently he mark'd their numbers far, T' exceed all compass for his works of warâ And thus his thoughts come forth: âWith joy, I see The inborn valour of my country free! No power the sun gives life will hope to gain Our Liberty, when bound in Union's chain! Only when Discord storms from State to State, They'll think t' oppress us with enslaving weight. We stand unitedâor divided fall, Kissing the dust beneath a tyrant's call! âMy bosom feels sublime to mark you now, Brac'd in death's armour to resist the foeâ But hundreds ten twice told and fiveâno more, I ask to wither the ingressing power. âA patriot, born with Freedom in his soul, Is equal twenty of a king's controlâ For what's a subject of a titled king? A slave in chains,âa mole,âa grovelling thingâ Earthly in mindâa grain of Freedom's dust Outweighs a banded host with slavery curs'd. âTake to your hearts my gratitude of soulâ Soon may you hear the patriot-calling roll, Inviting to the fieldâwhere oft have stood Your veteran fathers, prodigal of bloodâ Should future there be need, instant shall I Send to the mountains fam'd for Liberty. âSad I regret to speak you to the ploughâ But your vast names would clog the battle now.â Brief at his voice the multitude retire, Save but the number of the chief's desire. The god of day now cools his fiery steeds In the blue ocean, and the light recedesâ Water'dârefresh'dâtheir rapid race they hold To gain the eastâand lo, they touch with gold The fleecy curtains of the orient sky, Breathing effulgenceâclimbing heaven on high. When like young beauty morn's soft blushes spread, Macomb, instructive, to his chieftains said: âBy flying messengers, I learn the host Are at Champlain, commanded by Prevost. And let them come! We stand prepar'd to grave The dark invaders, or by land, or wave! But we'll anticipate the action firstâ By skirted war roll many into dust. âYour band advanceâtwo hundred warriors, Sprowl, And let true courage sparkle from your soul. Firm at the bridge that spans the Dead Man's Creek, Your cannon plant the enemy to check. With five times twenty, Appling, move beforeâ Block every avenueâtheir scouts explore! But when o'erpowering they your lines shall press, With fire receding, make their numbers less. And Wool, immortaliz'd with Scott, where bled Brock, whom the earth will honour with the dead, Lead on the Beakmantown Beakmantown wood. your squadron forth, Their bosoms rich with patriotick worth. Leonard, your brass will give their aid to Wool, To thin their ranks and make their daring cool. âHasteâto the field repair! Language is lost To those who never felt a coward's frost.â His gallant officers the foe to scath, Advanc'd their files on west and southern path. Appling and Sprowl adown the lake proceed, And plant their cannon with destruction's seed, At bridge of fatal name. And Appling, then, Passes the stream to scout with eagle ken. Wool to the west sustain'd by Leonard's band, With eye of jealousy surveys the land, Falling the stately monarchs of the wood, T' obstruct the foe's progression on the road. Now Wellington, (a brother to the same, Who fought the Franks and conquer'd them with fame,) While bounding through the forest with a scout, Spying the defiles and the country out, Observ'd the patriots on the north and west, Blocking the paths th' invasion to arrest. He wheel'd his charger;ârapid for Champlain, He bent his compass, urging spur and rein. Where wav'd the Prevost flag he curb'd his horse, And with quick accent gave him this discourse: âChief of a hundred banners! lo, they toil, The paths obstructing our advance to foil. Is it not prudent that we now should strikeâ We wait for you th' impatient word to speak.â âAnd can it be!â thus Prevost in reply: âNo thought was ours they'd dare to bend an eye To glance at our approach. Musick! the tune Beat that gives notice of a movement soon. Yet not in hurry, anxious we'll proceed, For when we strike, 'twill be but half a deed.â Brisk at the summons given, the drummers play The well-known air to strike the tents away. The heavy thousands move with motion slow, Measuring their paces in a martial show. So tardy was their march, the sun was laid On ocean's lap when they a league had made. But when the waves the second sun had damp'd, Near Wool's advance in regal form they camp'd. When day returning brighten'd o'er the land, To Powers and Brisbane,âPrevost gave commandâ Brisbane, to press on Wool with movement fleet, That Powers's flag he might at Plattsburg meet; He, Powers, instructed up the lake to move Slow and in silence, hid beneath the grove, That Sproul and Appling nothing might mistrust, Till they enclos'd should kneel upon the dust, Their standard in disgrace. Brisbane to guide Was Wellington's,âfor Wool had he descried. Brisbane and Wellington direct proceed To meet with Wool and do the rapid deed, While Powers with equal strength advances slow, Along the lake till Brisbane strikes the blow. As Wellington beside his general rode, Thus he the throbbing of his bosom show'd: âI crave the onset. Thou hast had thy fameâ And now I long to give my sword a name.â Brisbane consenting, answer'd: âTake your band, And prove the temper of your fire-edg'd brand.â He waited not for moreâbut done with haste The order given. And now, where Wool had plac'd Rifles to guard the pass, he stands in sight;â With lion daring they begin the fightâ Thrice they repeat the flamesâthen join with Wool, Whose cup of fame is foaming to the full. He forms and gives the word: âBehold, the foe Comes with proud banners,âconquest on his brow! A ripe gold harvest on your deeds awaitâ Lo, they advance! Quicken the spark of fate!â He held his peace. On Wellington, they pour Lead searching for lifeâth' Albions spill their gore. Leonard his engines manages with skillâ His each explosion solid squadrons kill. The heart of Wellington afflicted sigh'd, To mark his legions pour their bosoms' tideâ Tangledâbeset with interwoven boughs, While still from new-made wounds blood gushing flows. He puts his valour forth,âin front proceeds: âLet shame disgrace the dastard who recedes! What, do the cords that bind your hearts give way, That, but a scout your ranks should disarray! Pursue my guidance in the path of fameâ Though brave they meet us, we the field must claim!â Scarce the last utterance died upon his tongue, When a hot bullet from a rifle sung, And darted through his neckâthe artery tore Which held the stream of life. The rushing gore Purples his polish'd limbsâhe shrinks to earthâ His bosom heavesâhe diesâa man of worth. As Wellington departed, Brisbane cameâ Strength violentâand roll'd redoubled flameâ Yet Leonard with artillery, and Wool, Stood in their place till death the path made fullâ Then with slow inching they resign'd the ground, Pouring at intervals a deadly round. The meantime, Macomb jealously awake, Scann'd Prevost, artful, while along the lake Slow he advanc'd, while Brisbane, from the west, With urgent speed on Wool and Leonard press'dâ To Root he gave the purpose of his soul: âBound the lake path to Appling and to Sprowlâ Bid them recedeâfor lo, on Beckman road, To cut them off rapid the Albions crowd! Bid them with Wool in unity to form, And pass the Saranac to brave the storm. âAnd you, MacGlassen, will proceed and meet Woolâand his cohorts cover on retreat.â Root and MacGlassen at the word, retire, Warm'd with the glow of patriotick fireâ Root, leaping, made the bridge with arrowy force, And brief with nimble tongue began discourse: âI bear instructions rapidly to theeâ The arch kindle with fire, then backward flee,â Lock with the ranks of Woolâfor even now, To bar you from retreat hard crowds the foe!â Forth at the notice given, Sprowl, Appling, waste With fire the arch, and up the lake path haste. Lo, as the borders of the town they gain, Th' advance of Brisbane meet them on the plain! The heroes beat them backâand, pressing on, Reach without blood the centre of the town. But here the enemy their lines assailâ To take them captive once again they fail, Wool and MacGlassen fly to their reliefâ With ranks combin'd they plunge with bayonets brief. Bold o'er the Saranac they slow withdraw, Flashing the vollies of retreating war. Macomb the youthful Harrison commandsâ âAssist, the bridge to move with nimble hands; And, of its parts, close-fil'd, defensives raise, Where secret rifles may emit the blaze. âTaylor, proceed, and Turner, to the bank, And there with ambush'd fire the foe disrank.â By swift obedience they the soldier prov'dâ Sudden the arch is from its place remov'dâ And Turner, Taylor, Harrison, unite With Wool and Leonard, and maintain the fightâ At each explosion Leonard proves their death, While many a rifle steals away their breath. At length, the wasting of the flames to shun, Which beat like tempest-fire their lives upon, They burst the templesâclimb the steeples high, From whence their vollies on the Patriots fly. One draws the blood of Harrison, and soon, Taylor and Turner on the cold earth swoon. While thus upon the bankâSmith, in Moreau, Levell'd his engines, heated, on the foe, By which the steeples in quick flames burst forthâ Again the rifles draw them to the earthâ Yet stand the Britons and the combat hold, Though Wool and Leonard, slay them manifold. While at the river thus, Prevost his power Mov'd with slow time, the country to devourâ But in his fording of the streamlet Dead, Dead Creek. Prophetick name! Macdonough's gallies dread, Slaughter'd his ranksâthe stream turn'd red with bloodâ Down roll'd the bodies to the Champlain flood. At length, this fearful passage overcome, He enters Plattsburg with his soul in flame. Though down from burning balconies on high, The shelter'd Britons were compell'd to fly, Yet, obstinate, they strove the bridge to form, Lost in the whirlwind of th' opposing storm. When Prevost saw that Powers and Brisbane bled, He, in his caution, this commandment said: âForbear this idle effortâbootless toil! Why, know ye not that leisurely we'll spoil Their bulwarks of defence? Yes, when we please To raise our arm, we conquer at our ease! A wild-man's madness for a bridge to bleedâ Not worth the ball, should we effect the deed. Awayâdefensive implements apply, Till we with mounds our lines shall fortify. Soon, when secur'd, we bring our brass to bear, Ruin'd, we cast their labours on the air.â Hush'd is the strife immediate at the wordâ Sheath'd in its scabbard sleeps the smother'd sword. No spot stains etherâall is pure, serene, Save in the westâbut there a cloud is seen, Vast, like the Andes, towering on the eye, Fixing the soul in proud sublimity. It stands upon the earth!âof leaden hueâ A solemn contrast to the living blue. Though dark, yet not sufficient deep to blind The vital sun, burning with gold behind, Like something that is heaven!âthe beams of light Stream through the cloud to fill an angel's sightâ Beyond description beautiful, the fringe, Touch'd with ethereal gold and amber tinge, Pure as the courtly robes that seraphs wear, When they in presence of their God appear! Soon as deep Night pour'd darkness from his urn, And rubick lamps began in heaven to burn, Macomb conven'd his officers, and gave These brief commands, his enemies to grave: âMooers, to the pass superior of the stream Your cohorts lead, your country to redeem. Your front division in the works display, Should Prevost there attempt to force his wayâ Your rear conceal within th' embowering wood, To ope the secret fountains of their blood. When every let is made secure below, I then shall aid you to his overthrow. âSprowl, Grosvenor, Leonard, with your brass, and Bunkâ Bold names, that never from invasion shrunk, Defend the passage of the Saranac, Fronting the town, and beat their column back. âSmith, at Moreau, and Appling, you, at Scott, Stand with lit matches to explode the shot. The fort of Brown, MacGlassen, will be yours, To teach the foe that Liberty endures. Dunkin and Brooks, the upper arch defendâ Let none a standard in submission bend. âWool, with your spies the Saranac cross o'er, And search the rear of the invading power. Suffer no period of the war to pass, Their lines reserv'd with rifles to harass. I need not urge you of the perils roundâ Thy soul delights where dangerous scenes abound. âLet every heart be strong, as though the hour Alone depended on his single power. Let all be one, and every one be allâ Then, never, never will the Eagle fall.â His plan defensive laid, the chiefs proceed To take their posts and glory in the deed. During three days' continuance, the arms Of either flag by scouts excite alarmsâ The foe engag'd his heavy mounds to formâ Firm stand the brave to meet th' impending storm. At the third resting of the weary sun, To Macomb's ear MacGlassen thus begun: âFor three preceding days with prying eye, Jealous, I've mark'd the labouring enemy. By their sly art, believingly I feel, That they a battery opposite conceal. By thy indulgence will I ford the wave, And learn the truth,âwith fifty warriors brave.â Macomb made answer: âYes, thy soul is stoutâ Cautious advance and trace the secret out. A battery mask'd so near your fort to break, Would prove disastrous when the storms awake. Straight at the word, MacGlassen sought his holdâ Spoke for the numberâinstant they enroll'd. Though small his strength, yet every heart was large, To pass the current and the battery charge. Soon they in silence gain the adverse bankâ And in due order join in double rank. With feet of down, scarce breathing as they pass, They wake no tell-tale rustling of the grass. While thus with heedful step they trace the night, A band of Albions glimmer on their sightâ MacGlassen whispers: âHalt! bend eye and ear! And mark you not the enemy that's near, Like deepening shades in yonder growth conceal'd Thither we'll feel our way and make them yield.ââ With lungs scarce moving, soft they crouch along To gain the copse that screens the royal throng. As couchant lions watch to seize their preyâ So watch the patriots to begin the fray. Reckless the Britons of no danger dreamâ MacGlassen gives the sign! Mad flashes gleam, And kindle up the night! The quick leads dart With fiery impulse at the quivering heart: As when at evening, on the daisied grass, Resting at Champlain smooth'd to liquid glass, A herd of careless deer chew sweet their cud, Marking the moon-beams sailing on the flood. What time they thus on verdant couches rest, And floating images delight their breast, A band of panthers hid in ambush nigh, Leap from their place,âdeath fix'd in every eye. The herd stand paralyz'd with dread o'ercome, Nor know that flight would save them from the tomb. But thought returning, they outstrip the wind, Leaving full many in their jaws confin'd: So from the fiery charge the Albions fled, Save those who dying on the cold earth bled. MacGlassen rising with determin'd zeal: âLock into column, and make bare the steel! Lo, it remains to rush their battery now,â The feat will place the laurel on our brow. Pause notâbut onward ere that time have they To loose their hearts, now palsied by dismay.â The scout of night attended to each word, And with nerv'd motion seiz'd upon their sword. Napier,âthe chief who rul'd the secret post, By this had marshall'd into form his host. He rais'd a threatening voice: âThe man that flies, A swift destruction ends his perjuries. Th' assailantsâmark!âthey come! Elance the lead! Defend the flag! Cast flames upon their upon their head!â His language nerv'd their strength,âthey glow,âthey feel, As though their hearts were polish'd new with steel. But Freedom rushesâmounts the bulwark strongâ And soon in death is smother'd Napier's tongue. The Albions scatter from the brave in mindâ The mask in weakness at their feet resign'd. MacGlassen with emotion: âSpeed,âwith haste, Your hands put forth to ruinâsweep it waste! The foe alarm'd, by hundreds will arise And force us backâundone the enterprise!â While yet he spoke, they do the wasting deedâ The mound was ruin'd in a moment's speed. Rapid they wheelâretrace their footsteps back, And safe reford the dashing Saranac. The daring exploit all the brave admir'dâ To wrestle with the foe their souls desir'd. A host within his heart each warrior feltâ A rising fire to make th' invaders melt. Macomb approach'd MacGlassenâhim, address'd: âBy you this night will have its interest. The fort of your command would felt its fire, And many a life before its wrath expire. The deed hath rous'd the army into flame, T' achieve such actions as descend to fame. And I forbode this charging of his host, Will make the blood run madden'd of Prevost.â Like dew soft-dropping on parch'd flowers at night, So his expressions cheer'd their bosoms light;â And when exhausted nature they'd refresh'd, To couches they repair'd to lose themselves in rest. Meanwhile within a spacious hall apart, The royal chiefs gave pleasure to their heart, Boasting their country was the prime of earth, Though slav'd by priesthood, and by kings, from birth! While in these thoughts they startle at a soundâ And look with wildness on the other round! Another volley breaks upon their ear,â And in their eye surprise is mix'd with fear. They pause,âthey question,âanswerâstop and stare,â The growing wonder touching every hair. Downie, alarm'd, had landed on the shoreâ And now, behold, he enter'd at the door. While in amazement thusâPeachell, like death, Paleârush'd in the hallâpanting for breathâ (Peachell, the officer of second grade To him MacGlassen slaughter'd with his blade:) âThe mask is ruins by the midnight foe!â Napier is mix'd with rotting earth below!â As when the Stygian powers in depth of hell, Heard the result of Cockburn's doing wellâ They in their pride proclaim'd a day of grace, To celebrate the fall of Freedom's raceâ Some, for their pastime beat the streams asideâ And some rode whirlwinds in their joy astride. Some split the mountainsâothers turn'd them roundâ And some danc'd frenzied to a maniac sound! While in their sports, behold the earthquake blast, Broken, to hell their conquer'd monarch cast! Struck with despair, their levities were doneâ Their hearts congealing, harden'd into stone: So in surprise the Britons ghastly stood, When Peachell spoke of Napier in his blood. At length, with haggard features of a ghost, And breath convulsive heaving, broke Prevost: âMy heart seems cramp'd and frozen in my breast! Not possible their arms our works arrest! And is it truth, that past the stream they dare T' invade our lines and brave the tyger's lair? âWhy be it so. And have we dastards grown? Never!âat light our terrors shall be known! Wait we no longer than the rising sunâ Another day, their breathing life is done! No longer here inactive we remainâ At dawn we'll rise and sweep them o'er the plain. Then will New-Albion with our strength unite, And raise the Cross sublime on every height! At different parts at once we'll strike the blow, That the same moment is their overthrow. âDe Rottenburg, with your divisions move, And ford the shallow pass their works above. When firmly rooted on the shore,âdescend, Bristling in steel and cause their flag to bend. Kemp, at the arch superior you'll abide, To force a passage and the day decide. And, Brisbane, born to arms, your squadrons play At arch inferior, to divide the fray. And Powers, and Robertson, the bulwarks man, And let your sky-shells overleap the van. âThe battle, Downie, on the land will wait, Till we shall hear the signal of the fleet. The thunders bursting from the naval power, Will be the token for the strife on shore. âSoon to the south triumphant we'll proceedâ The life of Liberty in dust shall bleed. Three days from this in Albany we stand, Where Cochrane meets us with his ocean band,â Each to his post with hurried step withdrew, In purpose fix'd Columbia to subdue. The golden day-beams wake from dewy rest The larkâsweet rising from her low-built nestâ To kiss the melting clouds she prunes her wings, While, like the notes of heaven, her musick ringsâ The thrush,âthe linnet,âbird of every tongue, Fill the expansive firmament with song. Forth at the dawn's appearing, Albions rise, The pride of conquest rolling in their eyes. To force the arches, Kemp and Brisbane moveâ De Rottenburg to pass the ford above. The works by Robertson and Powers, are mann'd To blazeâas Prevost had the action plann'd. They wait to hear the navy. Hark!âthe gun! Behold the battle violent begun! As when two chains of deepening clouds arise From north to southâslow blackening up the skies. Grim, opposite they stand with scowlings darkâ At length,âexcited by an anger'd spark, They flash quick lightnings forth, and deafening roll Thunders in peals, convulsing to the pole: So when the fleet proclaim'd the signal sound, The earth shook reeling with the war profound. Mad bombs careering at each host were drivenâ The brass guns peal'd artilleries of heaven. While thus the battle rag'd upon the shores, The hostile squadrons join'd their naval powers. For many a weary sun Macdonough lay, Anchor'dâimpatient waiting in the bay: The Saratoga, twenty two and four, Supports his standardâwhom the brave adore. Never a mariner, ere left the strand, More bold than Gambleâsecond in command. The Eagle, Henley rules, of nine, elevenâ Ticonderoga, bearing ten and seven, The gallant Cassin guides upon the wave, Aided by Stanbury, both young and brave. The Preble, seven. Ten gallies, cannon eightâ And others fourâa single gun their weight. Of Macomb's works, Macdonough, opposite Anchor'd his fleet, when Albion loom'd in sightâ Flank'd each extreme with cannon-barges five, Deep through the chambers of the foe to drive. In this position moor'd, Macdonough lay, When Downie's banner flicker'd on the bay, Who, as around the Cumberland Cumberland Head. he wore, Gave the dread signal which the concave tore. Confiance, rul'd by Downie, thirty nine, Wars with Macdonoughâwhile he waves a sign, His other ships to springing cables, set In this position and the flames emit: The Linnet, Henly's Eagle to assail, And cause the freedom of her plumes to quailâ The Finch, and gallies, on his right to move, And there, the fruits of Nelson's valour proveâ With Cassin's ship, and Preble, and the five BargesâMacdonough's left with flame to drive. The angry Chub, against his right, to bend Her fiery force and make their flags descend. In this due order they their anchors castâ And each at eachâtheir smoky guns in blast, Appear terrifick as the lightning's flame, When thunders shake the elemental frame. Or when deep earthquakes open to receive The solid mountains and the things that live! Scarce less commotion characters the frayâ The battle's vastness takes the sun away. To land and fleet a rising rage is given. A darkening horror shuts the face of heaven. Lo, now the Eagle not a brass can bearâ And Henley gives command with dauntless air: âHeroes! the cable sunder from the bow! Our efforts here are vain against the foeâ Macdonough's ship and Cassin's, moor between, And there partake the glory of the scene.â Swift the removal at his voice was doneâ On Chub, the Eagle breaks her every gunâ But by the charge compell'd Macdonough brave, In Saratoga, on the troubled wave, Repels a triple powerâConfiance, thirty-nine, And Linnet,âsecond of the English line! Yet stands he firm,âof soul invincible, Whilst every side his crew their life's blood spill! Ticonderoga bears an equal partâ The haughty Finch she searches to the heart. Young Stansbury mounts the net-work to descry, How more effective that the globes might fly. âGive to the bow guns fire!ââ His voice is doneâ The gold-sand moments of his life are run! Swift from the tops aboveâa sighted lead Drank his sweet lifeâhe fadesâhe joins the dead! So a fair daisy in the morn is seen Besprinkled with the drops of heaven sereneâ A cruel ploughshare passes reckless by, And wraps its beauties in mortality. Thus Stansbury wither'd, ere his hour of noonâ A lily paleness marks his fatal swoon! Fierce flames the battle in its madness direâ The LinnetâDownie hurl the sheeted fire Against the Saratogaâbleeding dread, With many a hero number'd with the dead, The guns are shatter'd on her dexter sideâ Broken in fragmentsâscatter'd far and wide, The Albion fleet the shout of triumph raise To see Macdonough's wasting in a blaze: But lo, his mariners unruffled,âcool The hungry flames that feast upon her hull, Successive fall the Patriots chok'd in bloodâ The silver changes to a purple flood. Spencer, the bright-hair'd youth,âSmith, Balding, lay Streaming their lifeâbut scorn to leave the fray. Now the bold Gamble to Macdonough came, His eyes enkindled with the light of fame: âAlas, brave Chief!âhow desperate is the strifeâ Each peal of fire consumes us of our life! Our strength grows faintâOur starboard cannon, all Are laid in ruins by th' unsparing ball, We fail at each explosionâbleedâexpireâ Alas, unable to return the fire! âShall I the hawser part that holds the bow, And swing the ship, and thenââ Behold, a lead Enter'd his brain and struck him with the dead! He fell, a cedar by tornado rivenâ Swift launch'd his soul on lightning wings to heaven! To mark his gasp of death Macdonough sigh'dâ But ah, no time for sorrowâthus he cried: âCast forth the grappling anchor from the stern! Cleave the bow cable!âlet the larboard burn! Bring th' uninjur'd brass upon the foe! Be hearts immortal, and immortal show!â They do the deed. Slow winds the vessel roundâ But ere the cannon sinister resound, Thrice crew the cock with triumph wing on high, Giving the promise of the victory! âOmen propitious!â thrill'd the hero cries, âBe hearts of adamant! We gain the prize! Behold their smaller flags have wilted down! But two remain to wave the Lion crown! And these half wreck'd, are struggling on the deepâ Now prime the larboardâlet the cannon leapâ Each bosom be as fireâethereal flameâ The war-bird speaks, we fight the fight of fame!â The seamen worshipâhail the omen bright, With shouts redoubling,âand renew the fight. The Confiance shrinksâshe withers,âevery blastâ The fluttering Linnet seems to sigh her last. The crowded dead upon their decks are laidâ Downie, blood-stifled, sleeps in death's damp shade. Down sinks the Lion groaning with despairâ Proud sails the Eagle on triumphant air! The brightening Stars with hallow'd influence shine, And crown Macdonough with a light divine! The time the fleets the hollow concave tore, The conflict rag'd impetuous on the shore. Earth felt her pillars shake! At either bridge, Pil'd are the English deadâa ghastly ridge! With fire, with rushing steel,âthrice three, they toil'd The pass to gain,âthrice thrice the Patriots foil'd Their proud attempts!âKemp, Brisbane, trembled backâ Their hosts dissolving in the Saranac! What youth is that upon the damp earth sunk, His bosom mark'd with blood? Alas, 'tis Runk! Farewell, in brightness from the dust of earth! Hark! seraphs call thee to celestial birth! The car of heaven descends! I mark thee climb, Seated on clouds, the wonderous path sublime! And is there none to bear thee company?â Noneâthou art all who finds eternity! While thus belowâDe Rottenburg, above, His banner'd legions to destruction drove. Again, to pass the ford, they crowd the flood, While soft the Patriots crouching in the wood, Ken Macomb's brand. It waves! With bended eye, They draw the bead, that every mark should die. The flint hammers the steel! Ranks drink the flood, Struggling for lifeâmade brinish with their blood! Yet still by thousands with mad frenzy stung, Reckless they pour with shoutings on their tongue! Thus, when that Pharaoh with Egyptian host, Pursu'd the Hebrews to the Red-Sea coast, With shouts like earthquake pealsâtearing the sky, He led his legions on its base, made dry, Which gave a passage to his enemyâ But lo, the waters vengeful of the deed, Clos'd up!âthousands on thousands magnified the dead! So with a shout, the host of Albion now, Crowded the stream with triumph on their brow; But lo, the Patriots with a fiery shower, Smote them with death, and made the waves run gore! At first, the river bore the slain awayâ But soonâso vast th' annihilating fray, The dead the current chokesâMad swells the flood, Crimson'd and thicken'd with the gush of blood. It tops its northern bank and seems to flow, Pursuing, rushing, roaring on the foe. Behold, the river deity half seen In folding mist, up-heaves his dubious mien. His voice is heard like thunder in a cloud, Searching the hearts of the despairing crowdâ As when on Sinai, th' Eternal came, And spoke to Moses with the words of flame. A mist of blood he scatters from his hand, Marking their progress where they fly the land: When Nature's last,âher final scene shall come, Rattling the dry bones,ârotting in the tombâ Stars drop from their orbits;âwhen darkness crowds The struggling moonâthe sun wears coffin shroudsâ Man will stand dumbâhis knocking knees give way To mark the fastenings of the world decay: So stood the Britons when the thunders peal'd, And saw the blood descend upon the field. The foe destroy'dâslow ebb'd the waters backâ The dead wash offâsmooth glides the Saranac. âFredonia comes! Hearkenâher voice serene! Glory immortal to th' immortal menâ Names register'd on high! Macdonough, live!â A ring of hallow'd light thy brows receive! And round thy temples, Macomb! fadeless twine The sprigs of laurel from the soil divine! âHail! Freedom, hail! be thou to virtue given, And thou shalt be the chosen name of heaven!â CANTO XXXIX. DEFENCE OF BALTIMORE. ARGUMENT. Cochrane arrives at the mouth of the Petapsco .... Stricker gives Battle to the Invaders .... An Episode .... Defence of Fort MacHenry .... The British Defeated. The scene is generally below Baltimore and at Fort MacHenry .... The time is five days. While these events were passing, Cochrane set His compass from Bermuda with his fleet, Whitening the wavesâhis floating bulwarks stow'd With armsâto bend the land to servitude. Ross ranks the firstâthen Brooks and Thornton, plac'd With valiant men, whose names were ne'er disgrac'd. Soon they in crowds oppress the Chesapeake, Intent the wealth of Baltimore to seek. Their anchors they at the Petapsco cast As beams of lingering day reflect their last. Warren embrac'd the same inviting gale, That favour'd Cochrane from the tropick Isleâ Freighted with Packenhamâa countless host To seek Orleans and desolate the coast. What time that Cockburn at Petapsco lay, Waiting for Cochrane from the southern sea, The dark imbrewing storm the city saw, And rose to guard their altars from the warâ Their mothers, virgins, infantsâbosom wivesâ And all the charities for which man lives. Along the heights stretching from north to east, Ramparts they raise, th' invasion to arrestâ The only pass that offers to the foe, By landâto enter and the town subdue. The rule to Smith is givenâwho toils had seenâ He stood for Freedom, when his days were green. Stricker is next with scatter'd locks of snowâ Oft had he battled in the days of wo With Washington and others great and good, To whom is due a nation's gratitude. The city cohorts to his voice give ear, And bow with reverence to his character. The listed troops and volunteers of Penn, Are Winder'sâand Virginia's sorted men, Rodgers, than whom, no valour can excel, With stout marines stands breasted on a hill, Waiting the foeâHis cannon stretch their jaws, Ready to speak sublime upon the cause. The daring Armistead at MacHenry, stands To guard the channel from the ocean bands; Than him, more brave, none ever smil'd to hear The shock of armies roll along the sphere: Webster and Newcomb, Stewart, Evans, Laneâ And Clagget, worthy of a Homer's strainâ Bunbury, Redman, Adderson and Clem, And Berry, Penningtonâmore bold than them, Never drew swordâRussell sublim'd the barâ And Nicholson, that fill'd the court with awe, Compose his chiefs to aid him in the war. With breathing labour on the right they form Two mounds of small extent to guard the stormâ Twelve guns they place within their bosoms each, Should that the enemy attempt a breach Rear of the town: The City Battery, one, The other bears the name of Covingtonâ A name the soldier ever will revere, And o'er his grave let fall a patriot tearâ The youthful Webster gives the first supportâ With band selected, Newcomb holds the fort. On Fort MacHenry, and the breasted height, Where Smith and Stricker in their age unite, Alone the City for defence rely To foil the efforts of the enemy: For should th' invaders sweep the lines away, Armstead in vain would guard the narrow seaâ Or should the Fort surrender to the Crown, The lines could nothing to defend the town. The time that Cochrane had his anchors cast, And saw his navy at their moorings fast, Accompanied with Brooks and Thornton, Rossâ (Each bosom tinsell'd with a star and cross.) He to the Marlborough in a yawl repair'd, To learn of Cockburn how his fleet had far'dâ And what resistance they might calculate, Ere Baltimore would yield in captive state. They found the man,âhalf devil,âat his easeâ He rose to greet his brother of the seas. When they inquiries had to him address'd, His Vandal feats like triumphs he express'd: âMost royal Cochraneâhonourable Ross, Free from the poisoning bane of vulgar dross! Of my success, 'tis bootless to enquireâ Behold my vessels laden'd with desire! As were the mandates to our sovereign given, This sword a ruin through the land has drivenâ By granting large of booty to my force, Each hostile arm was shiver'd in our course. Beckwith deserves an honour equal mineâ I've sent him northward to the Prevost line, T' inform the governor-chief we soon shall meet His strength at Albany with all our fleet. âBut sad at Hampton, where we toil'd of lateâ (My mind grows sick at what I now relate,) The sons of Erin nothing could restrainâ I'll pass it o'erâthe subject gives me pain! âHad Emmett, Rowen, when they strove for power, Conquer'd our arms, how mercy would deplore The sad eventâcivility unknown, 'Twould been a land where devils would be shown! But England, for their peace laborious delves, And by her armies saves them from themselves!â They paus'd. To hear of violence,âdepress'd Was every brow. Cochrane at length, address'd Cockburn, abhorrent: âNever could you give A harbour to such crimesâof crimes that live, The blackest is to this, as noontide light, Compar'd with darkness of the pall-black night. âThough we instructed were to waste the soil, And make our navy wealthy with the spoil, Yet nothing farther was the king's desireâ Except at times to light a publick fire. âWhen this proud city we shall demonstrate, Orleans is next that bends beneath our weight. Warren and Packenham, expect us now, At Lewis Bay, when Baltimore shall bow. âCockburn, to us each circumstance declare, What strength presum'd, against our powers will dare. Ross, bold demands his legions to debark, When morning star shall wake the springing lark.â Cockburn, this answer like indifference said: âCertain I feel we've nothing here to dread. To guard the channel, stands a recent fort, MacHenry nam'dâso faithful spies report. âRoss can debark so soon as he shall pleaseâ Deliberate reach the city at his ease. Some hasty volunteers from States around, Fenc'd with light works are station'd on the ground. But when approaching they shall hear his feet, They'll fly before him in a wild retreat.â He ended, flush'd with smiles. And Cochrane, last, âIf such their power, full brief their flags are cast. Th' invading arms will crowd the shore at lightâ Ross, in the town will be secure at night. Cockburn, display your wonted energy, And you, the Knight of Baltimore, will beâ For, with the fleet you'll storm MacHenry. âLet each his post be ready to maintain, When doubtful day shall glimmer on the main.â They having thus their demonstration plann'd, Each chief departed to arrange his band. When Cockburn anchor'd at the Point, North Point. below, Bird, with close eye, kept notice of the foe. When he the sails descried of Cochrane's fleet, Back to the lines he dash'd away with heatâ And, as the sun was stepping down the west, He made th' encampment, and to Smith express'd The tidings big with fateâhis chiefs around, Bent every ear to catch th' important sound: âWarrior of ancient years! behold, I bear Intelligence to call forth all your careâ So vast a fleet with Cockburn has combin'd, It seem'd a labouring burden for the wind To loom it up the wave. With anchors deep, They ride the flood that bathes the beetling steepâ Their live decks, fill'd with burnish'd armour bright, Cast back of fearful splendour on the sight.â The herald ended with an anxious look, And thus in turn the hoary veteran spoke: âLet them advance! We now in arms are strongâ Yea, let them pour innumerous alongâ We ask for their approach in pomp of prideâ They'll find their safety but on ocean's tide.â He paus'd. And Stricker took the passing word: âI feel to meet them and unsheath the sword. Wait not their comingânever! I'd propose, Forth to proceed and with their standards close. When dawn's bright gem shall kindle in the skies, Let me and mine press forward for the prize. We'll check their progress, if we can no more, Ere they approach to melt beneath thy power.â Smith, this rejoinder gave; âBrother in arms! Joy throbs my heart to see the battle warms Thine aged blood! Thy sparkling eye looks youngâ A warrior's impulse moves upon your tongue. âFriend of my heart! we verily must prove The valour of our yearsâthe stain remove, Produc'd by Hull, who, when in youth, you know, Bore a full tide of death against the foe. The fame hath gone abroad, his heart was old, Hence, avarice urg'd him to accept the gold, Or terror froze his bloodâtherefore, disgrace Has indirectly darken'd all the race Of Silver-headed GraysâBut Rensselaerâ KingâMountain Shelby, and the bold Adair, And Whitleyâmurder'd Swiftâa hoary trainâ In part have wip'd away the odious stain. âTo us it now belongs to show the young, We greet no musick like the cannon's tongueâ Howard, with scatter'd locksâMacCollock, brave, In armour clad, stand forth their town to saveâ Press'd with the weight of seventy years and ten, They boys inspire to do the deeds of men. Shall we not more than beat th' invasion hence, While such in honour stand for our defence? âArdent, your purpose, Stricker, I approve, That your battalions at the dawn should moveâ Bold at the shore their first divisions meet, And then, with caution to the lines retreat.â Here ended their consultâForth Stricker wheel'd, And join'd his warriors on the tented field. The weary sun now takes himself to restâ Yet still the earth is clad with golden vestâ Step after step, delay'd, he travels down The steep of heaven to kiss the mountain's crownâ Reluctantâlingering, slow he veils his face, Blushing the eastern clouds with bridal grace. With tender cast he bends a farewell eye, Then weeps bright tears of gold and passes down the sky. At length, the orient star makes glad the eastâ And quick the drummers their brief visions ceas'dâ Rapid the hammers tremble on the drums, Drumbling the roll: They riseâthe column comes Glowing with zealâtheir bosoms as with fire Burning to check the foe, or in th' attempt expire: Thus worn with wan disease, a suffering soul, Chain'd to the dustâfetter'd to earth's control, Struggles for heaven. At length, invisible, An angel comes and breaks life's citadel! The Spirit freed, travels th' immortal road, Sublim'd with glory to her new abode: Something like this, the Patriots, as in charm, Rise to the musick of the drums to armâ They form, they wheel, they step the martial beat, Each swelling bosom glowing with its heat. These the bright names who feel their feeling young, Leading the band: The horse prance slow along, Champing the bit, as Biays in manhood's prime, Measures the path, as beats the musick's time. Their burnish'd trappings dazzle on the eye, Effulgent as the sun's bright jewelry. Next the sage Stricker by himself is seen, Reining his chargerâtouch'd with lightning keen. He looks a pillar of a cloud by day, To guide the column in its proud array. As round he bends his eye, each chief,âthe whole, Catch the quick glance which enters to the soul. MacDonald, Sterret, Berry, Fowler, Long, Demand the musick of harmonious song. And Splonger, Robertson, t' acquire the wreath Of laurell'd fame, pursue the steps of Heathâ Then, Steiger, Fraily, Howard, Asqueth, Moorâ And next in centre the artillery corps, Rul'd by Montgomeryâwhose patriot name, With years will brighten on the page of fame. Levering and Metzgar, Quantril, beat the tuneâ Then Sadtlers rifles and the bold Calhoun. Two leagues they halted at the sun's declineâ His chariot wheels descending in the brine. Their tents whiten the fieldâthe guards around, Are plac'd to catch the whisper of a sound, Which might proceed in darkness from a foe, Lurkingâtheir strength and circumstance to know. The time the column was engag'd at this, Stricker, the horse sent forward on express: âBiays, loose the curbâbound rapid to the seaâ And mark them well with eye of jealousy, Till from the shore they moveâthen, instant back, That I may plan the method of attack.â Scarce had the order echo'd from the chief, When, with a ready guard, Biays fil'd in briefâ An arrow's motion, leaping he withdrew, Twelve furlongs distant from the Point and two. Now as the Albions previous had devis'd, At day they arm with thoughts unciviliz'd, The city to consume. Forth they debark, Each bosom glittering with a royal markâ The Lion standing on the Eagle's head, Graven in brassâboasting her strength was dead. Deep as they crowd in martial robes complete, They seem like clouds disgorging from the fleet, Thousands on thousands crimson all the strand, To riot, spoil, and conflagrate the land. They camp for night. When day illum'd the cast, Ross mounted and his regiments address'd: âBehold, this day, is day of festivalâ Soon waves the Cross in yon proud capital! Only have we our armour to put forth, And lo, their Eagles will be quails of earth! Three days, commencing on the coming even, Will to th' indulgence of the soul be given, Behold the glittering of yon lofty spires! How will they guide to heaven the flickering fires! The publick roofs strike level with the groundâ No work of taste shall on our rear be found. The libraries conflagrateâmonuments of art, Crumble to dust to bring them low at heart. The pen of History This was broken at Washington break,âhistorians bribe, That none hereafter may the war describe. Should this be writtenâEurope might arise, To take deep vengeance for the injuries. âAdvance! let each his circumstance make goodâ The Eagle's bosom shall be stain'd with blood!â The martial musick at the word begun, Their floating streamers brightening in the sun. Soon as their banners wav'd upon the sphereâ Biays wheel'dâreboundedâthus to Stricker's ear: âLo, they approach!âfor earth a burning loadâ Crowding beyond the sight the reaching road. Loose to the southern gales their flags are given, Like infant clouds that float along in heaven.â He stay'd for no replyâbut backward flew, Jealous to keep the enemy in view. The veteran chief to Stephenson, his aid, Turn'd, and this order with expression said: âRowel thy chargerâto the centre here, Command the leading warriors to appear!â The youth attended to the accents few, And through the line with arrowy motion flew,â The summons utter'd to the highest grade, Who at the instant of the word obey'd. Stricker, his orders thus: âLo, now hath come The time to guard our altars and our home! âThis is the place of each: Montgomery, Long, And Sterret, with your bosoms beating strong, Move in advance:âwhen you the defile Long-Log-Land. pass, Thus stand immoveable with feet of brassâ Your left file, Sterret, on the path will restâ Your dexter wing upon the streamlet Bear Creek. west, Long, on the left of Sterret, rank your menâ Montgomery, your artillery between. And Fowler, sixty strides on Sterret's rear, Let your battalions in a line appear. And you, MacDonald, in reserve, will hold Your warriors, tested as refin'd of gold. âBut first, your columns marshall'd in a wedgeâ Warm throbs my heart to give their souls an edge.â The chieftains heard; and presently withdraw, Their every fibre chorded for the war. The cohorts rapidly in files are squar'd, As Stricker's mandate had express declar'd. The aged, mounted on his foaming steed,â Cools his chaf'd ardour to a gentle speed. Lofty and short he prances o'er the ground, Thickening his stepsâhe hears the bugle sound! His passion kindlesâeye shows fire!âagain The warrior curbs him with an easy rein. On as the veteran moves with motion slow, The passing zephyrs lift his locks of snow. Soon as he opposite the musick comes, A shrill salute redoubles from the drums. Thrice swell the peal unbroken in a roll, Then silent at a beat. He breathes his soul: âDefenders of the soil! Behold, this day, To you 'tis given your virtue to display. A ruthless enemy the land pollutes, Who, by his numbers your defeat computes. Think but of Hamptonâand your blood must rise! The nameless scene was darkness to the skies! To spoil our city in their rage they comeâ Their Vandal torch is kindled to consume! Your wives, your mothers, and your virgins fair, Trembling await to learn what souls ye are! Their charms alluring tempt the wolf-like foe, Te seize the lambs and lay their beauty low! âIndignant, rouse the soul! A righteous Power Will plate our hearts in the conflicting hour. Death will our wounds make goodâo'erwhelm the race, Which multiply their crimes,âdeep-dy'd disgrace E'en to the savage name. What feel you now? Feel not your hearts resolv'd their flag to bow? Yes, I behold the quickening fire withinâ I mark the flush,âindignant,âhot 'tis seenâ Yea, broiling on your cheek! Feel not your blood Boil in your veins,ânever to be subdu'd? âEach chief his band, his battle-line array!â With thoughts electrick of your sires,âdisplay!â Dumb in their place the Patriots gazing stood, Listening to hear his voice. At length, the blood Reliev'd their crowded heartsâcool reason shoneâ Then they perceiv'd his eloquence was done! Sensations new their every bosom fir'dâ Ethereal touch,âeach throbbing heart inspir'd. Strong in the faith of Liberty they move, A retribution on the foe to prove. By this, the van, that bore the Standard-Cross, Had gain'd a cultur'd valley, led by Ross. Soon they laid waste the promise of the field, And Biays, quick-wheeling, back to Stricker wheel'd: âSoon on return, I met the royal van Spoiling the fieldsâthe future hopes of manâ And as my charger on the path I bent, I mark'd the torch of fiery element!â He ended. Numbers presently arose Their hearts in burning with their ranks to close. The veteran's bosom throbb'd a youthful beat, T' observe the kindling of the warriors' heat. He testifies their virtue: âPride I feel, To mark your nerves with keen sensations thrill: But from the lines six only can descend, And with due caution with their van contend: âLevering with HowardâAsqueth, your riflesâStiles, You with your cannon take the centre files. Biays, lead them to the foe and scour the plain, That none in secret may their path profane. Heath, to your valour I the band submit, That you a name of honour may beget.â Their feet with rapidness the way devourâ Feeling each footstep an increase of power. The harvest desolateâthe royals now, Their march resumeâhalf smiles upon their brow. Full to the city they their course pursueâ But low the Eagle bends upon their view! Ross when he mark'd her wing upon the wind, Show'd with a leer the workings of his mind: âIs that the Bird whose eye defies the sun? This earth too gross for her to gaze upon! But giddy pride is frequent made to fall, And crave permission in the dust to crawl. What, does she think the motto of her beak Will cause our blood to chill with tameness weak? She threatens us with arrows! what of them? Blunted their points. Her starry diadem We'll cause to darken in our presence soonâ âStrikeâwarriors, strike the battling, kindling tuneâ Scathâscath her wings with fireââ Heath gave the signâ And, at the motion of the sword, his line Of rifles open'd with a bended eyeâ And Stiles exploded his artilleryâ Deep wounds are seen, and deep mortality. A lead sung burning through the brain of Rossâ His gilded metal fritters into dross. He falls, and mingles with the vulgar dead, While still unsparing drives the whizzing lead. The forward legions of the foe stand dumb To mark their chief a subject for the tomb. Swift spread the panickâbut the undaunted Brook Rush'd, with sword brandishing the airâand spoke: âWhy stand ye thus to die? Rise, and the loss Avenge Albion's starr'd honour, valiant Ross! Though the Columbians in the field are bold, Yet, ere night's curtain shall the earth infold, Our flag shall wave victoriously! The ball Wing with the speed of fire their ranks to fall Beneath a knitted brow, hard bend the eyeâ Proud wave the Cross in style of chivalry.â They rallied, and advanc'd in phalanx strong To whelm the Patriots in the dust along. The words of Heath are fire: âThriceâthrice explode, Then, on retreat, the vacant tubes reload. Let the bead shine deliberate on the mark, Ere from the flint ye strike the secret spark.â Like oaks that brave the elements, they stand, Till thrice the vollies flame upon the bandâ But when the foe united were again, The heroes wheel'd retreating o'er the plain. The fall of Ross was heard from tongue to tongue, Nerving their hearts for proud exertions strong. As Heath receded back, the rushing Brook Heated his arms with battle in his look: âFlight gives them life! Now on their left wing pour The musket's violenceâthe mortars roar. Distant with these, we'll break their solid menâ With rifles, fatal aimâand muskets, then, Shower the field. Their left we first must turnâ Inflame the chamber'd dust,âthe cannon, burn!â The deep-mouth'd engines answer with a peal, Which makes the bosom of the earth to reel. Montgomery's spirit quickens, as with fireâ With burning lips, he bade the brass expire: âBrighten the match! Be ready to put forth! Direct the engines level with the earth. Behold, in air their dread explosion dies! Not so with usâlet death-fire blind their eyes, Sight,âsight the cannon with an eagle watchâ Then, let it feel the sparkle of the match.â Scarce was the order echo'd on their ear, When flames exploding, dash'd along the sphereâ Nor empty flames aloneâeach peal, that rung, Bore the dread note of death upon its tongue. A path was open'd through the columns wide, But numbers crowding, soon the void supplied: Thus when a ship majestick in her pride Dashes impetuous through the tumult tideâ On either hand, the waves disparting swell, And chafe, and foam, and madden round her keel. Before her prow, the billows are destroy'dâ But straight the rushing waters fill the void: So close they up their files, and hide the slain Cramp'd with their death upon the gory plain. So deep the wound, it checks their bold careerâ Halted they stand, and burn the hollow sphere. Stricker the pausing of their flag beheld, And to the thunder-chief his courser wheel'd: âCeaseâcease, Montgomery,âfrom explosion ceaseâ Yield to their standards momentary peace. Let them approach within the musket fireâ To aid your brass the infantry desire. Your skill and coolness in the day of strife Will give your name to dwell in future life.â The sage concluded; the command was doneâ In dubious peace was smother'd every gun. The mean time, Stricker, with a watchful care, Bounded to Fowler, station'd on the rear: âThis day must reach futurity! With haste, File to the left extreme, where Long is plac'd. Well can we scan th' intentions of the foeâ His purpose thisâthe left to overthrow.â Scarce had the accents sounded from his tongue, When Fowler led his solid strength along. The same time Stricker to the right wing hied, And thus to Sadtler, without preface, cried: âTo yonder cottage, with your Greens, advance, And there bestow their souls' deliverance.â Sadtler leaps forward with his rifles green. The veteran chief is with the artillery seenâ And Stiles he orders thus: âTwo guns detachâ File to the left, and ply the quickening match. Fowler support.â Ere that his word was done, Stiles, with the cannon, had his march begun. Now to Montgomery the sage exclaims: âThe right give succour with artillery flames. I to the left in person must repairâ The proudest efforts of the foe are there. Thy soul is adamantâthy heart is steel'd With honour's breast-plate to defend the field.â This saidâthe lines he passes slow alongâ Brief and abrupt the accents of his tongue: âBe firm,âstand fast,âbe confident in mightâ Fear not,âshrink not,âwatch close the shining sightâ Be pillars,âpyramidsâbe mountain oaksâ Be steel,âbe monumentsâbe flintâbe rocks.â The veteran's lookâhis gesture, voice, and form, Wake a new feeling to defy the storm, Kindling the field, their every eye strikes fire, Flashing to day the hidden soul's desire. And now, in regal pomp, the Britons come In two divisionsâmadden'd with the drumâ Their left with Thornton to oppose the rightâ With Brook, their dexter wingâthe opposite. Brook waves the flag. His column forth displaysâ And presently the element is blaze; But Stiles, with pointed brass, Fowler, Stricker, Long, A deluge pour upon th' invading throng. Mean time, his column, Thornton, heavy, slow, Moves to the right to strike its standards low. But soon Montgomery his deep thunder peals, Opening the streams of lifeâthe column reels! Behind the cottage, standing on the right, Thornton files off to shelter from the fightâ But death is in the screenâlo, Sadtler brave, With sighted bullets, strikes them to the grave: So when on Mississippi's flood of late, The Tennessee struck,âbilg'd, and sunk to fateâ The face of heaven was curtain'd thick with night, Save here and there, a star of doubtful lightâ Uttering a death-scream numbers drank the deepâ Whilst others struggled on the wave to keepâ Some clung to willows,âlife, a dying sparkâ While others, failing, dropp'd into the dark. Some, with herculean nerve, approach'd the shore, When, lo, the shadow of a plank, an oar, Deceiv'd their graspâthey catch upon the shade, And sink, and struggle, where cold death is laid: Like this, th' advancing Britons, to avoid Montgomery's engines, which their life destroy'd, Obliquely fil'd behind the cottage small, To gain a covert from the slaughtering ballâ But wo-deceiv'dâthey find a shadow there, Which fails, and sinks them in a deep despair. Still obstinate they press, though every wound Draws, in full streams, their life upon the ground. And Sadtler must recedeâPlying the brand, He burns the cottage, and withdraws his bandâ Re-forms on Sterrett's right, and there, with eye Bent on the silver, strikes the enemy. Lo, now the war extensive through the lines Ragesâeach power its energies combines. The kindled field becomes a liquid flood Of pouring fireâthe earth is drunk with blood. As when imprison'd earthquakes, from beneath, Burst on the elements with flaming breath, The solid mountains tremble as they rise, And the vast ocean breaks upon the skies: Thus terrible the strife. The patriot band, Firm as the pyramids of Egypt, stand Wrapp'd in a cloud of fire. Death fans the blastâ Whilst numbers, pale with dying, sigh their last. The holy drops of Freedom stain the earthâ But fame shall light them to immortal birth. The valiant Donaldson with polish'd mind, In science learn'dâwith poesy refin'dâ While in his efforts to uphold the strife, To guard a bosom'd infant and a wife Free from the stain of the polluting power, A lead in secret through his vitals tore. He fell upon the battle-field, and found His restâa martyr in the cause profound: A cedar thus, by a repeated blow, Sinks on the mountain, with its verdure, lowâ Though prone, o'erwhelm'd,âits oil embalms the tree; Nor mouldering time can wear it to decay: So in the dust the warrior's head is seen, Yet will his virtues be forever green, Which, like the cedar's oil, will bear his name To distant years with undiminish'd fame. For two hard hours, the brave unbending few Stand in their place, wasting the foe like dewâ But, lo, on either flank, the royals crowd, And this the veteran proclamated loud: âYour arm is thunder strength! your searching eye Is lightning burning through a tempest sky! Your deeds have testified, your fathers' nerve Lives in each fibre! Now with the reserve Wed and make strong. A sea of flames with awe Palsies the foe! MacDonald waits the war.â Deep, solid, heavy, slow, they give the ground, Blazing at times a heart-expiring round: So when a cloud of hail has grimly lower'd, And lovely nature in its path deflower'dâ Behold, the north wind dies! the storm retiresâ Flashing, at intervals, its angry firesâ Pealing its thunders with a lumbering note, Deep grumbling, sullen, as it rolls remote: Thus move the warriors, in their glory proud, Like the dark rolling of the fiery cloud. They join MacDonaldâand, in martial form, Wheelâand, like rocks, stand planted for the storm. Mean time, the Britons in their places stood, Muttering revenge to satisfy their blood: As when excited mastiffs tooth a bear, The shaggy veteran, rising from his lair, Mad riots in their blood:âStill the fierce pack, By numbers strengthen'd, slow compel him back, Sour, grim-scowlingâyet they, so torn with fight, Fear to pursueâbut, growling in their spite, Stand licking of their wounds:â So stand at bay The royal names, not daring to the fray. Stricker, perceiving that their pride was done, In the rich feeling of his heart begun: âColumbia ever, ever will be free! Neverâno, never will she bend the knee! With infant strength, we've tam'd the Lion downâ He stands at distance with a reckless frown. âBack we'll recede upon the breasted line, That Smith and Rodgers may the laurel twine. 'Twill be ungenerous to receive the wholeâ Noâgive the ground, and prove the nobler soul!â They file for marching. At the martial beat, They wave their banners, and with pride retreat. During the battle, Cochrane, on the beach, To Percy, waiting, gave an anxious speech: (Percy, a man whose bosom never felt Those tender touches, that the feelings melt) âLo, two full hours, the din of conflict vast Hath heavy thunder'd an unpausing blast. I'm lost in doubtâin wonder, at the soundâ I'd thought, ere this, the city had been crown'd. Not small must be the bleeding of our lossâ Leap to the fieldâand this declare to Ross: Bid him, his strength no longer to exhaust, Till Cockburn's navy on the fort shall burst, Early at morrow's dawn:âby dull delay, It was not possible the present dayâ But when the sounding mortars he shall hear, And see, with fiery trains, the bombs career, Then, in the city, with a sudden rush, Enterâtheir standards in submission crush.â Percy was mounted, ere the word was doneâ He reins his courser with the message on. He checks his speedâWhy does his eye look fear? A royal corse is stretch'd upon its bier! A file of warriors, burden'd with their wo, Down to the shore are moving with it slow: âWhat noted chief bear you away to death?â âAlas, the general fell upon the heath, Leading the standards on! Most sad the lossâ Noânever shall we find another Ross!â âRoss?ânot possible! you meant not so! What Ross, our arm in war, in grave-dust low! Openâshow me the wound!â âTime failsâfor lookâ The battle's doneâI must away to Brook. His name was half a host!â This saidâhe rein'd With sinking heartâand soon the horrour gain'd. He stood in silence cramp'd, to mark the fieldâ At length, his pride, deep-wounded, he reveal'd: âAlas, what deathâwhat scenes of havock round! What potent warriors glued upon the ground! Our brightest star in bloody clouds hath setâ Rossâth' invincibleâthe bravest yet That e'er an honour grac'd!â âThese thoughts are coldâ I bear to RossâRoss!âRoss is no more! But hold, Whilst I the purposes of Cochrane show To act in concert for their overthrow. âThrough want of anchors, cable-springs to form, It was not possible the fort to storm, As was the plan devis'dâbut when with light Glimmers, the day-star, all things, requisiteâ Cockburn, MacHenry will involve with flame, Which soon must bent it to the Albion nameâ Then will your army with ambition rise, And make a finish of the enterprise.â Brook, in his grief, rejoins: âMost sad, indeed! Two thousand royal names, unsightly, bleed. Not a less number on the plains are strew'dâ And many a royal chief in death-robes glu'd! Alas, to speak the horrour of the strife, Pains to the centre feeling of my life! âNumbers, o'erwhelming, must the foe have been, Though one brigade, the only that was seen. And how they liv'd, is past me to explainâ We fill'd the element with fiery rain. But all, who fell, were hurried from the field, Hence, not a captive in our hands, we held,â Noneâsave this warrior with a hoary brow;â Blood gushing from his ancle, brought him low. It moves me to the heart;âhis frosted hairs Should been his voucher from a warrior's cares.â âAway that woman's thought.âI'll make him tell What brought him here, and how in fight he fell.â Percy approach'd the sage: âSay, silver head, What news are stirring with the millions dead? Your look bespeaks you from the tomb, of lateâ On what dark subjects do the dead debate?â âNo bosom that has heartâno heart that's brave Will e'er insult the tenants of the grave. It proves a character devoid of worth, To speak irreverent of the low in earth. âI, your expressions but regard as airâ Not worthy notice, he who mocks the hair Bleach'd white by wintry years.âIn days gone by, I with your sires, have foil'd the enemyâ With Wolfe, on Abram's Plain, I stretch'd this armâ His smile was peace,âhis bosom friendship warm. By his example in the fight, I stoodâ Yeaâand mine eyes beheld him sink in blood! âAnd ere that day commenc'd, thus mild he said: âMacCulloch, treat the veteran's hoary head With kind regard,âand, to a bleeding foe, Extend a helping hand, and every aid bestow.â Such were thy siresâHow fallen!âhowââ A flag of white, Suppress'd the thought, which swell'd his bosom tight. It bears the sign of peaceâBehold his son! An Esculapianâwho, to Brook, begun: âChief of the Albion bannerâlo, I bear This flag to search my father in your care. His name, MacCullochâdeeply furrow'd, oldâ And far beyond his strength his heart is bold. In peace, he sums the riches of the portâ Collector. Too, too feeble for this last effort. I fear his locks are matted in his goreâ His hoary years are eighty one and four.â Thunder exploding from a cloudless heaven, Would not a greater, colder wonder given. It struck e'en Percy with a cowering lookâ But after pausing, thus the generous Brook: âThat ancient man, fair youth, must be the sameâ Description answers, both in years and name.â While this he spoke, he pointed to the sage, Showing respectful reverence to his age. The youth, with doubting eye, beholds his sire, While Brook and Percy from the scene retire. âWhisper to Cochrane this: I'll urge my best, When Cockburn storms the Eagle in her nest.â But what may we expect, when silver'd men, Like this sage warriour in their ranks are seen. My soul it withers in despairing deep, Beyond this field, where prime of Albion sleep. If bayonets can prevail, the town is mine, When gold-lac'd sunbeams on the waves shall shine.â The foul-tongu'd Percy mounted at the wordâ Arriv'dârepeats it to the chief on boardâ Cochrane held hard his brows with gloomy low'r, Like a grim cloud before a midnight shower. Meantime, the youth dismounted from his horse, And with heart-feeling, open'd the discourse: âMy honour'd father!âkeen my breast throbs pain To see thee wounded on the sanguine plain. You would not hearken to my mother's tear, Urging thy stay from scenes of bloodshed here. Thine arm is young no more. Thy locks of snow Excuse thy service for thy country now.â âMy son,â (the sire rejoins) âtalk not of painâ To be thus wounded is superior gain. Yea,âevery pang, that lances from the part, Binds my lov'd country closer to my heart! â'Tis true, thy mother weeping, smote her breastâ Hung on my neck in piteous grief distress'dâ Yet loosen'd I her grasp, though bent with years, While my soul melted in a shower of tears. âWoman was made in peaceâher heart is kind, And soft, and flexible, her yielding mindâ When man is tortur'dâin his soul oppress'd, Pity, in tears, sits hovering on her breastâ But mark, my son, where judgment leads the way, Let not her tenderness thine actions stayâ For should you yield, though round thy bosom clasp'd, She'll sure despise you, when the danger's past. âNo man to meet the enemy is old, While his dimm'd vision can their dark beholdâ Yes, while his eye can trace their murky shade, Never too old the nation's strength to aid,â Though at the time, his aged head were bare, With scarce a lonely, widow'd, scattering hairâ Were his lax'd hand too feeble to sustain The lightest weapon wielded on the plain, Yet his sage presence would the young revive, And prompt them to effect the deeds that live. âBandage my wound. And well this heart you know, While it beats life, will beat against a foe.â The youth, with tender hand and skilful art, With soft emollient, soothes the burning smart. The generous Brook acquits him on parole, For which the son returns a grateful soul. He mounts his father with a tear-damp eyeâ They reach the camp as night rolls down the sky. At length the morning gleams through half-form'd clouds, A robe of mist, the rising sun enshrouds. Pale in the west, a dingy bow is bent, Of rain, prelusive, ere the day be spent. As growing twilight hovers doubtful round, The bombs of Cockburn at the fort rebound. Rockets, careering, lighten as they fly The breast of ocean, with a crimson dye. Instant the thunders lumber'd from the fleet, The Albions grapple armsâthe drummers beat Spirit from the tuneârising with the fife, Leading the drums, they breath'd a freshen'd life. They fileâthey marchâtheir terrours cast behindâ Their flag, redundant, floating in the wind. Soon, in full prospect of the lines, they comeâ But, lo! to mark their strength, in silence, dumb, Halted, they stand.âBrook, forward, with his glass, Bends to behold a defileâlet, or pass, To rush his armsâhe marks where Rodgers stands With lighted matches to consume his bands, The ridgy bayonets o'er the mound appear, Death hovering on their points with frown severe, The mettled ardour of his soul gives backâ His heart dies in him, thinking of attack: Not otherwise a wolf with hunger bold, Comes rushing forth to leap into the foldâ Each step progressing, sharpens his desire To bathe his jaws in bloodâBut lo, a fire Glares on his eye!âhe snuffs, he stops, he starts, While terrour through his vitals, hurls his darts.â Half he recoilsâfire gnashing from his teethâ Hunger half drives him to the flame of death. He foams with passion, while his lurid eye Betrays the secret of his agony: So Brook stands doubting to approach the fight, Till humid darkness draws the veil of night. While thus the adverse banners on the land, The brave defenders in MacHenry stand Buried in deep, dark silence, to behold The wrath of Cockburn in broad flames unfoldâ They stand unmov'd, like Pilot-Mountain oaks With roots hard grappled to the bolted rocksâ The flam'd artillery of an anger'd heaven, To rend the oaks, with pointed blaze are drivenâ The mountain plants stand smiling at the wrath, Their heads majestick, in a fiery bath. So the defenders of the fort maintain An eye, unwinking, at the burning main. The voice of Armistead flows:ââThis, this the hour To test the soulâthe strength of mental power. When man is lost in turbulence of fight, Th' expiring thought is driven from his sightâ But when serene, he stands and smiles at death, It proves him more than worthy of the wreath, Which Fame delights to place upon the brow Of him, whose breast is offer'd to the foe. âBeyond the measure of our reach are they, Hence, vain our flash, should we elance the sea. Soon may our silence near them on the tideâ How my heart palpitates with kindling pride To see you stand like pillars on the heath, When loud the thunder speaks with lightning breath. âThinkâO think, how honourable to die! Remember'd ever with a tearful eyeâ Holy embalm'd in every patriot's soul, While earth revolves, or sun through heaven shall roll!â He scarce had finished, when a bomb-globe burst On a charg'd thunderâbroke it into dustâ Clagget and Clemm sad perish by the blowâ For whom is shed the balmy tear of woe: Thus on the borders of Petapsco's flood, Two lofty elms in primal grandeur stood. The silver stream their thirsty roots supplied, With living waters in their downward glide. Their sweet buds open'd in the infant spring, When first the swallow twitter'd on the wing. New-rob'd in loveliness, they wav'd serene, The clouds alluring with their foliage green. The sun's pure gold, when first he gave the day, Was rich reflected from the leaves at playâ Thus cloth'd with beautyâby a sudden flash Gleam'd from a storm in heaven! With ruin crash, Bow'd were their heads to earth!â Thus fell the brave, And sunk with all their honours in the grave. The Albion, now, believing his report Had bent the stubborn vigour of the fort, A signal wav'd, the navy to unmoorâ They weigh, sail, slacken,âanchor near the shore! The born of Freedom, with a smother'd pride, Behold their movements, nearing on the tideâ Armstead breathes valour: âPatriots! markâbehold Their loosen'd sheets before the gale unfold! No whisper, stirâbreathless, be hush'd, be calm, Or they perhaps, would curdle with alarm! They think, perchance, they've buried us with dreadâ But soon we'll show the rising of the dead! âThey comeâthey anchor! mark! levelâno more!â The cannon peal'd like heaven's artillery roar. The flames, forth-streaming, were like Ãtnian firesâ The fleet creen'd on the sea! Blood flows and man expires: Thus was Vesuvius muffled for a time, Accumulating power to roll, sublime, A blast to jar the sphere. Behold, at length, Its prison'd thunders rose with deepening strength. A flooding cataract of flame pour'd forth, Rending the elementsâbreaking up the earth:â Scarce with less violence the circles gleam With dire explosions lumbering o'er the stream. The fleet, half broken, to their place withdrawâ And shower the fort with burning trains of war. A deep close silence hovers o'er the earthâ The water-swollen clouds pour torrents forth. Impervious night seals up the scroll of heaven, Save the red rockets at MacHenry drivenâ Their trains careering as they upward sweep, Are dire reflected in the dark, black deep, Malignant, fearful, like the comet's blaze, Fixing the eye of mortals in amaze. The tender bosoms of the city break, Whilst the big mortars the deep ocean shake. A fate, uncertain, magnifies the vast, And gives each peal, an earthquake-swallowing blast. Hark! whence this terrible, tremendous sound! The heavens seem falling to the delug'd ground! And is the foe at hand? MacHenry, lost! Or is the rampart into ruins toss'd? A sudden flame mounts dreadful through the night, Tinging the city with a doubtful light, Resembling that which glimmers from the moon, When struggling in eclipse at midnight noon, Touching the forehead with a dubious gleam, Like ghastly spectres of a madman's dream. Th' affrighted virgins with distraction flyâ Their shrieks ascending to the suffering sky. They rend their bosoms to the darkness, bare, And scatter to the wind their loosen'd hair. The floods, unpitying, drench their tender limbsâ The whole creation with the deluge swims! At length, to Smith the troublous scene was known, Which made black midnight startle from her throne: He sent for Howard, stooping with his age, And bade him forth, their terrours to assuage. The grey-hair'd warriourâfriend to Washington And Morganâreach'd the city, and begun: âCast back, my children, these distracting fears? Calm, calm your bosoms?âstay these anguish'd tears? The foe attempted to invade the shore Where youthful Webster stands, but floods of gore Compell'd him to retire!âThis wildness calmâ Your brothers guard you from offensive harm. âYon fiery rockets burning through the sky. Show the sublime, without mortality;â Though to the shrinking sight, it seems that death At every blast would burn us with his breath, Yet, in MacHenry, only four, with fame Have fled to heaven upon the circling flame. âThe foe must seek his safety on the mainâ My children shelter,âshelter from the rain! No Vandal torch will e'er the city burn. The High Supreme defends us! To your homes return!â As when the rous'd-up North, tempestuous driven, Dashes the ocean, foaming up to heavenâ Grinding to powder'd dust the granite shores, Whilst loud the element, like deafening, roars. At length, outspent the howling of the North, The tempest dies!âthe South comes gliding forth, Borne on the chariot of a silver breeze, And smoothes the surface of the ruffled seas; So hush'd the tumults of the tender breast, When Howard gave the promise of their rest. Cochrane perceiving that the strife was vain, Bounded to Brook, and thus with hurrying pain: England's defence! behold, we've come too late, The city, proud, with flame to demonstrate. Hence, wheel the army, rapid as a flight, Whilst every eye is blinded with the night. Cockburn is order'd to inflame the air To keep engag'd the soil-defenders there. Brook felt his language trueâand, at the word, Wheel'dâmade the beachâembark'd his troops on board, While Cockburn flam'd the night.âAt early beam He left MacHenryâfloated down the stream. Soon was the sphere unrob'dâThe mantling red Hover'd with beauty round the mountain's head. The plains slow open'd and expos'd to sight The foe departed with the clouds of night! A holy transport swells from tongue to tongueâ Tears of warm rapture stream from old and youngâ Wives, husbands, mothers, sisters, brothers press Each to his bosom, lost in happiness! CANTO XL. BATTLE OF NEW ORLEANS. ARGUMENT. The Cities fortify against the Enemy .... Fort Bower .... Cochrane's arrival in the Bay of Saint Lewis .... The landing of the advance of the English Army .... Jackson's Night Attack .... The British make two unsuccessful attempts to gain the Breastworks .... The Decisive Battle .... Peace descending from Heaven, closes the poem. The scene is principally laid at the Bay of Saint Lewis and on the plains of Calmut, below the city .... The time is nineteen days. Now when the States with soul abhorrence saw Britain's design to wage a Vandal warâ That spoils and rapine fill'd her heart with joyâ That all her thoughts were loosen'd to destroy,â One voice from Florida to Maine was heard, To rise in panoply and draw the swordâ Grace, Hampton, Norfolk, Baltimoreâof late, Urg'd their uniting with unbroken weight, To guard their cities smiling on the sea, From the rude grasp of spoiling Royalty. On Heights of Dorchester, where Washington Planted his flag, Boston from tyrants won, The proud Bostonians elevate a fort, And islands fortify to guard their port. Portland is quicken'd with an equal flameâ And Portsmouth rises to preserve her name. A lofty bearing nerves the city Yorkâ And Philadelphia labours at the work. Richmond, Savannah, Charleston, all and each, Combine to bear th' invasion from the beachâ One hand, one heart, one ardour fires the whole, United, boundâeach wedded to each soul. Now to Orleans, emporium of the west, Jackson repairs with thunder on his breast. To Carolina South, his birth was givenâ There the bold chief inhal'd the air of heaven. Proud in his youth, he heard the martial beat, And kindled at the sound with glowing heatâ Join'd the Star-banner in its waving high, Bearing the promise of his Liberty. When the hard struggle of the fight was done, He trac'd the compass of the western sunâ Where the broad Cumberland with downward sweep, Majestick rolls to wed Ohio's deep, The youthful hero found his second home, Where, taught of Science, learned he become. Fair Tennessee, endow'd with equal right, Knowing his mind was equal to his mightâ From Nashville, eagle-built on Rock-tower Height, Sent him her statesman to the Hall of fame, Where, with the People he enlarg'd his name. When in the present war the Nation rose, Th' unhallow'd acts of Britain to oppose, He snatch'd his father's weapon from its place, And took large vengeance of the savage race. A foe more skill'd in battleânot more brave, Demands his valour and his wisdom grave. Though tall his stature, with proportion slim, Yet a strong nerve inspirits every limbâ High-arch'd his forehead curvesâhis visage spareâ His whitening locks his growing years declare To be in autumn, ripe with wisdom's fruitâ To plan the fight, and then the fight dispute. His eye shows openness and seems to speak, But nothing's there that shows a woman's freak. His will chains every nerveânone durst betray The secret feeling he would hide from dayâ But when he wills, his every look takes fire And flames to view the hidden soul's desire. The City, long foreboding in despair, Rise and salute him with reviving air. Glad, they submissive bow to his command, Secure beneath the shadow of his hand. Two other warriors with the hero came, Than whom more brave ne'er kindled into flameâ Carrol and Coffee. Rude their sun-burnt men, In simple garb of foresters are seenâ But markâthey know with death the bead to sight, And draw the centre of the heart in fight. Kentucky, bleeding with her bosom bare, Scath'd in the fieldâyet nothing of despair Palsies her strengthâher warriors with Adair, Adown th' Ohio stream impatient glide, To mix the blood of tyrants with the tideâ The heart-cold massacre of Raisin wakes Avenging passion till their bosom shakes, Stirring a spirit righteous in the cause, To keep inviolate their equal laws. Rough in their arms the Louisianians rise, Fix'd or to die, or grave their enemies. Their brothers from the north with joy they hail, Savioursâto guard them with defensive steel. While thus the Patriots crowd to Jackson's power, The foe for lack of spoil assails Fort Bower. Four ships cast anchor and let loose the ballsâ Pouring a storm of thunder at the walls. Six full battalions land upon the beach, With weapons bar'd to enter through the breachâ But Lawrence from the fort soon scours the landâ Three bleeding vessels scatter from the strand. The broken Hermes drifts upon the shore, Where soon her standard is made wet with gore. Warren and Packenham, with feelings cast, Groan'd, when they learnt that death had fann'd the blastâ Now cover'd with chagrin, their look was sadâ And now, their features scowl'd with anger mad. While thus their passions cool'd, then flam'd with heat, Lo, in full prospect Cochrane show'd his fleetâ Days three times seven from Petapsco's mouth, He'd sail'd inglorious to the waters south. Warren, delighted when the ships he spied, A tier of cannon thunder'd o'er the tide. But Cochrane, humbled by the late defeat, Unanswering, mov'd his heavy-sailing fleet. As run the sand two hours from risen day, He dropp'd his biting anchors in the clay. The royal chiefs conven'd his ship on board, To learn th' important triumphs of his sword. Warren with smiles of pleasure in his look, Rich in his confidence, enquiring spoke: âMost noble Cochraneârank'd in high repute, Why answer'd did you not my grand salute? So late departed from the conquer'd shore, Your navy must be fill'd with Baltimore. âYou seem not well! You've bled with wounds I fearâ Or is too warm the southern climate here?â Cochrane paus'd deepâthen answer'd: âYes, I feel Wounds more corroding than the biting steel. My fame is wither'dâbroken is my host! Defeating slaughter turn'd us from the coast. Full many a Briton has return'd to dross, With whom in death-robes is the noble Ross! Two thousand slumber in unwaking restâ The dead will show we done our effort best.â As when a band of robbers grim unite To plunder travellers, aided by the nightâ The more they gain, more avaricious theyâ At length, they stop them in the open dayâ Imbolden'dâwith impunity they steal, Till the hard griping of the law they feel, Then they turn pale and tremble with their fearâ So they, the Britons, in their looks appear. The first is Packenham to gain his tongueâ He speaks with lightness, though his heart feels stung: âAway these heavy thoughtsâthis feeling lowâ Shame that we cower and knuckle to the blowâ True worth, by rising from defeat, we'll show. Our sighs are vainâthey magnify the lossâ To die in war was honourable to Rossâ 'Tis woman's weakness to bemoan their fateâ But now 'tis ours, Orleans to Demonstrate. Here every wish that gratifies the soul, Will yield us luxury for all our dole. Am not I Governor of the City made? And each, who wills it, shall have civil grade. A star of honour on each breast shall glowâ Yea, every chieftain shall my bounty know. âWe've learnt experience by the late defeat, No more in parts to separate our fleet. Instant, with shallow vessels we'll prepare A proud descent upon the coast to bear: âWith your division, Keene, proceed beforeâ Three thousand strong and fortify the shore. Brook, Thornton, Gubbonârocketteers with Lane, Will land and aid you to intrench the plain. Cochrane, to you I give the honour'd post, To sail the first and bear them on the coast. Soon, I in person shall augment your powersâ The Mississippi and her floods are ours! â'Twas long determin'd in the council grand, (When war was rumour'd,) to invade the strand, And seize Orleansâthat all the Union West Should be subjected to the king's behest. âNo difference what we loose, or what th' expense, On,âwe must moveâdash opposition henceâ Orleans once conquer'd, half the States are oursâ More valu'd prize ne'er rous'd the royal powers! This city gain'd,âour losses on the sea, Will in the splendour be dissolv'd awayâ And all disasters suffer'd on the land, Will be defac'd like characters in sand. âTime denies us more. Cochrane, Keene, depart, And bear the line with conquest on your heart. Warren will soon conduct upon your rear, Lambert, reserv'd, of tested character.â With rivetted attention they receiv'd The wordâand think the victory achiev'dâ Cochrane and Keene upon the wave advanceâ And soon their flickering standards wanton dance On Ponchartrain. At dawn they make the strand, And spread their terrors o'er the smiling land. Keene places Gubbon on the sylvan road, Twelve furlongs distance, whence the river flow'dâ The left, with Thornton, rests upon the bankâ Pulse beating high the Patriots to disrank. When Carrol, Coffee, had with Jackson join'dâ Of three five hundreds was their strength combin'd. Jackson had plann'd defence in judgment style, From Mississippi to the swamp, a mileâ And jealous scouts had plac'd around to spy The first approaches of the enemy. Hindes, station'd on the borders of the lake, Each fibre thrilling for his country's sake, Beheld their woven wings like rack of clouds, Which half the firmament cerulean shrouds. Breathless he kenn'd them till they made the beach, And stood paraded in their martial reachâ Then, fleet to Jackson, urgent on his horse, He leap'd his wayâarriv'dâdescrib'd the force: âThe foe hath landed at Bienvenu! I judg'd four thousand as they pass'd in view. Steady I mark'd their movements on the shore, Till thus they halted, confident of power. Their left upon the margin of the floodâ Their right defended by the cypress wood.â A word from Jackson answers for replyâ And presently his chiefs he orders nighâ Carroll and Coffee, Doquien and MacRee, And Pierce, and SavoryâRoss of Tennesseeâ Dyer and Gibsonâvaliant Lauderdaleâ Planche, and others, never known to fail. Henley and Tompson, Patterson, the braveâ Three mariners of fame to rule the wave, With Louisiana and the Caroline, Among the group with naval emblems shine. These in due order standing, Jackson, now, Reveal'd his purpose to attack the foe: âLo, the invaders tread upon the shore, Thousands, as three to one in pride of power: But energy will make their thousands bend, And, to far distant years, our names descend. Cloth'd with the night we'll storm upon their campâ Appal their purposesâtheir ardour damp. âCarroll, on road Gentilly, you'll proceed, And stand reserv'd, whilst I perfect the deed, Striking surprize. Pierce, Coffee, and the rest, Will use their arms. The sun below the west, Has dipt his charriot wheels. In twilight gleam, Prepare your warriors for no nightly dream. âHenley and Patterson, in Caroline, Descend and anchor opposite the line. Their left they've plac'd for safety on the bankâ You'll break the charm by opening on their flank. Your thunders rolling on the ear of night, Will be the signal for the rushing fight. In Louisiana, Tompson, move at sevenâ âNo moreâAttend minute th' instructions given.â As Jackson clos'd the order, Carrol wheel'dâ The other chiefs paraded on the field. The naval heroes to their ships repair'd, And down the current on their purpose far'd. As day retir'd, Jackson proceeded slow, To be in readiness to strike the blow. Soon in the twilight are the Albions seen, Doubtfulâhe halts his column on the green. Lone he advances on his close-train'd horse, And reconnoitres the invading force. Back to the cube with loosen'd rein he bounds, And this commandment to the brave resounds: âCoffee, to left, and Lauderdale, withdraw, Full opposite their right to push the war, Whilst with the dexter, at the time, shall I Strikeâand the foe give privilege to die. âThis is the time for Tennessee to show, That when she rises, tyrant blood must flow! You've met the desperate savage in arrayâ The same unbending of your souls display. Yeaâprove the sameâthat Britons too must yield, When bent on death you meet them in the field. Should we this night give backâthis signal nightâ The torch of Freedom is depriv'd of light! A single nerve relaxing of its weight, Will give the city to unsparing fate. None will relax! I know what thoughts ye feelâ The net-work fibres of your hearts are steel! âSoon with Kentucky sage Adair will come, And then we'll give the enemy his doomâ Yea, bid a proud defiance to the foe, Should all the strength of Britain urge the blow! Keen by their watch-fires let your rifles aimâ Plunge with the steel, when once the ball shall flame. âWhy wrestle with your souls? Of words, no moreâ EnoughâI've seen you in the battle pour! âYe long,âimpatient long, to hear the sound To rush, and crush their life upon the ground. âI will no more. Coffee, advance your line, Ready to serve for death! The Caroline, Will soon their funeral speak!âthen chafe with ire Life's vital cisternsâwake the flinty fire!â The patriot warriors stood above the earth, What time his soul in eloquence pour'd forth. Coffee, in silence passes to the road, And Jackson, solemn, where the river flow'd. They hark impatientâevery sense awake, To hear the cannon from the waters break. Meantime the Albions at their ease appear'd, And nothing they of brewing darkness fear'd. Keene pass'd along the lines with lofty tread, And as he pass'd, these promises he made: âThis night indulge the merry-making feastâ But when young day shall waken in the east, Be ready for the move! An early hour Will find the city kneeling to our power. Yesâere that Jackson shall have time to form, To meet the rising of our thunder storm: Rumour reports their general bears that nameâ Plum'd in renownâa momentary fame, By fighting wild-menânowâbut now he'll find, That we are fatal by superior mindâ Hence, when we kindle in our terror soon We'll cast his laurels to the waning moon. Yea, ere the strength of Packenham shall land, Orleans resigns! the Eagle flaps the sand. The deed will live till earth with age shall rot, And make each name immortalââ Lo, the shot Thunders from the ship!âBlazing from the flood, The fury comes and covers them with blood! Coffee, in rage, rolls slaughtering on their rightâ Jackson, a whirlwind, blasts them in his might: Thus hungry wolves in absence of the day, Invade a field to make its lambs their preyâ They stop and listen to the watch-dog's cry, Baying the moon till she forsakes the sky:â At midnight,âsilence muffles up their tongue, The wolves creep tender with soft ease along, Fearing to wake the motion of a strawâ A grassâa leafâand disappoint their maw By starting up the mastiff sleeping still, Ere that sweet blood had satisfied their will. While thus in feast of thought, lo, panthers nigh, Crouch on their rear with keen sagacity, Bent on their lifeâthey leap the leap of deathâ Each fangs a wolf loud screaming in his teeth. The wolves not grappled by the panthers dread, Bound from the earth and think themselves are dead: So fares the enemyâin dire surprise, They shriek out, âDeath!â and by that sound arise! Gubbon gives way from Coffee's flint-struck firesâ Back on the centre wildly he retires. A truant ball strikes Lauderdale below The curling ear, while mingled with the foe. Between the neck and jaw the ruin flies, Mangling the art'riesâbrief the warrior dies. As falls a poplar flourishing in heightâ So sunk the chief and darken'd into night. Not unreveng'd his blood: Through Gubbon's back, Swift as he flew the direful attack, Death tore its wayâhis bosom's engine rentâ Fractur'd the sixth rib as it outward went. The Albion shudders with convulsions strongâ Sunk to deep night upon the plains along. Inward he bleedsâbut soon with foaming large, The lungs the current of his life discharge Frothing from his mouth. Cramp'd, his fingers dent Deep in his palmsâand brief his life is spent. Now to the river Coffee feels his path, The foe consuming in his waken'd wrath. Fierce on their rear he drives the blade of deathâ Jackson in front impetuous spends their breath. Confus'd in wild commotion of the fray, Floating in blood their ranks are roll'd away. Mad Jackson, Coffee, in their strength unite, And dire pursue them through the shades of night. Meantime Fredonia on the wall serene, With eyes, pure wash'd in heaven, beheld the scene. To Fame this charge she gave: âIllustrious Maidâ Descend and veil the field in misty shade. Eclipse the burning starsâthat not entire, The Albion host upon the field expire. That Jackson, born the nation to unite, May gain the honour of a closing fight.â Fame momentary dropp'd her wing from heavenâ And roll'd the mist as were instructions given, Then rose elastick on the spring of fire, And gain'd the height more rapid than desire. The stars are smother'd in their orbits dark, Shielding the royals from the Freedom mark. Jackson, his foe unable to discern, Proclaims th' unwelcome order to return: âWarriors! the sudden darkness of the night Restrains our will to farther urge the fight. Hence, wheel and camp upon their ground. This gloom, Thickening the stars, hath sav'd them from their doomâ Had but the stars shone forth, they'd press'd the heathâ Not one in arms would fled the gripe of death. Close darkness covers them. Man can no more, Than act his utmost in the favour'd hour.â As when the north commands the storms to ceaseâ They hear,âand hush their savage broils in peace: So at the voice of Jackson through the plain, Their tempest blood is stay'd. They seek amain The conquer'd field, where Keene had chose his camp, Waiting with smiling heart to mark the lamp, That burns for dayâto rise and guide his course, To bend the city to his royal force; But now, the ground the sons of hunters hold, Till morn shall streak the heavens with lines of gold. At length the hours slow wind the night awayâ On ocean's brim appears th' approaching day.â The Jackson band when they the sign discern, With waving banners to their lines return. They pile their sanguine arms, and, nerv'd with heat, Labour to make their infant works complete. But Tompson's ship, and Patterson's remain, Where they in night the royal ranks had slain. Meantime th' invading band with Thornton, Keene, (Save what were dying and what dead were seen,) Rejoin'd their filesâfor Keene was not subdu'dâ He takes his former station on the flood, Where Jackson late with his battalions rose To fence the land against ingressing foes. The Louisiana now, and Caroline, With brass well pointed open on the line. For three revolving suns and glasses seven, Raking the field the sheeted fires are driven. At length the foe a ball-proof battery raise, From whence, effective, they elance the blaze. With scorching globes the Caroline takes flame, While adverse winds confine her on the stream. Soon Patterson perceives his ship must burn, And bids his mates with Tompson to returnâ They leap into the boatsâthe loss repine, And to the element the ship resign. Scarce had they join'd the Louisianian crew, Than loose in heaven, the burning vessel blewâ The Albions shout the ruins to the sky, Fill'd with proud thoughts of future victory. But Tompson, ranging every gun aside, Still'd them with death, while shoutingly they cried. When twelve explosions from the ship were driven, Large to the western gales, the sheets were given, Which, without wavering, to the compass blew, And bore the vessel to the breast-lines, newâ Where, on the river, in her strength she lies, The name of Jackson to eternalize. What time the sun in zenith glory shone, And fill'd with golden light the western zone, Warren, Sir Edward, landed on the shoreâ Never such numbers on the sail beforeâ Gibbs, Lambert, character'd with warriors great, To rule the columns of o'erwhelming weight. As leaves, innumerous, quiver on the treesâ As swarming multitudes of clustering beesâ As stars in heaven, as sands upon the shore, So seem th' invaders from the deep to pour. Gibbs, in the centre, on the right of Keene, Marshals his host, who oft the field had seen; On right of Gibbs, Lambert extends his band, Than whom, more brave, ne'er trod a foreign land. Proud in the centre of the crimson lines, The tent of Packingham with splendour shines, At head of which, a flag-staff mates the skies, Bearing the Cross to speak to distant eyes. Now come to Packingham, defeated Keene Saluted, and commenced with solemn mien: âBrother of Wellington! my heart gives backâ I know not why,âbut sad was the attackâ Yea, thou must hearken, though what I recite, Should damp thy bosom with the drops of night. âScarce had I fix'd my line upon the shore, Giving instructions for the morning hourâ When lo, the enemy, a sudden flood, Drove in and drew the richest of our blood. I ralliedâfoughtâbut soon my strength gave wayâ Such desperate passion urg'd them in the fray. âThe first alarm was thunder mix'd with flame, From a dark vessel hid upon the stream. This day, with heated globes, from yonder mound, We cast her broken through the void profoundâ Gibbon expir'dâand with him, hundreds four, While twice that number sprinkled earth with gore. âSix thousand warriours must have form'd their strength, To strike such numbers lifeless at their length. This Jackson seems an eagle on the wingâ Yea, he defies the standards of the king. We each must watch the movements of his eye, Or not this host will yield us victory. He now with art is labouring to defend The pass,âthrough which the city we must bend. âAnd now would I in confidence propose To move upon them and with bayonet close. Early, at dawn, ere they their works complete, I'd charge upon them, and their lines defeat. Sustain my legions with proportion might, I'll mount the ramparts and their prospects blight.â Thus Packingham: âWith pride of heart, I hear, Though struck with sudden death in night severe, Your soul is rous'd to wipe away the stain, And the past glory of your arms maintain. Strengthen your veterans.âIn the blaze of day, Teach them to die, when we commence the fray. And should your effort need increase of power, Gibbs will advanceâhis name, a bulwark tower. âLet Jackson, or ten thousand Jacksons join, The whole must kneel, when men like you combine. Turn, bend your strength against their dexter wing, Bearing in front the standard of the king!â His thoughts were full of conquest. Keene obeysâ Numbers his host, and one by one surveys, Sees each is furnish'd for the enterprise, To storm at Jackson, when the day should rise. At every step, he feels his impulse largeâ And whispers to himself: âNow mine's the charge!â So, thus a stately bull, subdu'd in fight, Stung with reproaches, meditates at night His absent enemyâhe braves the flood, Hardening his strength to do the work of bloodâ He paws the earthâhe grinds his pointed horns On flinty rocksâand drives through wounding thorns. He bellows to the blastâhe snuffs the wind, And stands and triumphs in his mighty mind: Such were the feelings in the breast of Keene, As with his passion, he inflam'd his men. While this transpir'd, the patriotick band Incessant labour'd to defend the land. Plauche, and Daquin, and Lacoste, retain, With Ross, the right position of the plain. Carroll's division in the centre standâ And Coffee on the left maintains the land. Patterson, Cowley, late of Caroline, And Cormac, fair in youth, their strength combine, Th' unfinish'd batteries on the right to form To show a bold resistance in the storm. And now, the starry eyes of heaven burn clear, Looking with melting love from sphere to sphere. Clouds swim looseâfloating on the breath of night, Touch'd with the silver of the moon's soft light, Like angel spirits, when they sail around To bear some message with delicious sound, Sweet-breathing to the stars. But now, behold, Like breath they vanish from the star of goldâ The last, but loveliest of the train of night,â Soft it approaches with delicious light, Trembling and flushing through the cedars green, Like some fair maid half willing to be seen. Soon as the star of morning gilds the skies, Keene's crowded columns for the combat rise. Slow, as in martial pomp they press the road, The herald bombs with fiery trains explode. Ready for war, his ship had Tompson sprungâ Sublime his cannon speak with death's deaf tongue! Yet pause they not, though ranks on ranks are brokeâ Not death disturbs them by his voice, or look! From bulwarks half complete the Patriots aim, And strike the enemy with solid flame. Gibbs marks the conflictârushes to the scene, A full division to support of Keene. And now firm-wedg'd the boast of England stand, Though hundreds fall and eat the bloody sand. The line of Jackson burns like heaven on fireâ Albion's like Hecla, when its flames aspire. Clark, Churchill, Shannonhouse, Bray, Clinton, Knight, And other names, fall blasted in the fight. Lo, Henderson, the pride of Carroll's force, Is stopp'd amid the glory of his course. An envious bullet fasten'd on his eyes, Whose flash was lightning to his enemies. As some tall ash, which oft had brav'd the blast, Rent by a whirlwind, is destroy'd at lastâ Its branches bent awryâits verdure fledâ So on the cold earth lies the warrior's head. For hours twice three and seven, the Albions strive To force the battle and the Patriots driveâ But so exhausting is the Jackson fire, Through walks of blood disaster'd they retire. But Packenham, who frequent death had seen, Is not discourag'd by defeat of Keeneâ It only rous'd his myriads to display A greater courage at the next essay. He gives instructions to his chiefs around, Ready to hearken and obey the sound: âFor two succeeding days we'll mound the earth, But on the next we'll move for conquest forth. And when we strike, we'll strike the blow unknown, When half their eagle watchfulness has flown. âDuring the night preceding of the fray, Gibbs, Thornton, secret with pioneers away, And, near their right position, batteries raise, Prepar'd at signal to elance the blaze. Lambert, whose bosom's fountain in the storm Chafes like the Clyde when swell'd in wildest form, Lead your battalions to the left extreme, And let your fires the highest heavens inflame. Thus at the moment we their flanks shall downâ And then, triumphant, we approach the town!â This order having pass'd, they file away, And every part implicitly obey: For two succeeding suns they mound the heath, To guard the sudden breaking in of death. But in the darkness of the third deep night, Thornton and Gibbs raise bulwarks on the right, And as the morn the face of ocean streaks With purple light, their new-made thunder breaks. Lambert, his squadrons urges with a press To humble Coffee into littleness. While this was done, no time the Patriots lost, To make secure against the kingly host, Their labours of defence. With joy they hear, Kentucky hastening to relieve them near. Lo, at the signal, when the blast begun, Instant each heart was melted into one! Coffee at Lambert pours a fiery stream, Yet firm he stands, and wakes the battle's flame. At length so wide, so withering is his lossâ Full many a silver life is turn'd to dross. He reels, gives wayâbreaksâscatters o'er the fieldâ And forth the works of Gibbs and Thornton yield. And Patterson's, and Cowley's cannon soon, Sweep them away before the time of noon. The pride of Albion in the dust is low, To be thus handled by their western foeâ Men, late from managing the simple plough. Yet Packingham reveal'd no look dismay'dâ His columns squar'd, he this exclaiming, said: âErect your souls beyond these trials past! By slow approaches, they'll resign at last. Something to warm this icy feeling, now, Will soon remove this dampness from the brow. Ere long, we'll find them, careless of their guardâ Then ample will the day our toils reward. Disaster, frequent, in the end is best. Where the soul scorns to be by fate depress'd. Our loss will make them vain of their success, And cause them soon to lose their watchfulness. Perchance they now may laugh upon our power, By which, we'll conquer in a happy hour. âHence, for the time, defensive we'll remain, And, when unlook'd for, burst upon the plain.â The columns heard, and to their tents repair'd, And there, oblivious, on their luxuries far'dâ The palsy of their hearts remove with wine, Steeping their troubles in a bath divine. The bold Kentuckians, marshall'd by Adair, Land at the cityâpresently repair To join with Louisiana, Tennessee, On death determin'd, or their soils to free From tread of hostile feet. When Jackson saw His brother chief made venerable in war, He plied the left sharp rowel to his horse, And metâsaluted, and began discourse: âGlad beats my bosom with a sacred glow, To see a man who oft hath seen a foe. Thy days of youth were spent in arms with me, Against the sires of this same enemy. âThrice have we metâthrice foil'd their veteran bandâ But mark how vast their gathering o'er the land! Thy sage experience and thy valiant power, I need, momentous, at this trying hour. You've fought with Shelby, long renown'd in fame, And caught the manner of his conquering flame. âIn your defensive line we place our trust, To guard the soil and bow their heads to dust. The whole made strong with solid batteries eight, To mount twice six of heavy-casted weight. âYou, with Kentucky, will the centre hold, Supporting Carroll, noted for the bold.â Jackson concluded. And Adair replied: âMy heart delicious throbs with holy tide, To have the honour to unite with thee, Whose name will brighten to eternity! âThy plan defensive is a theme of praiseâ Thine every act decisively displays A soul that burns to live! 'Tis true, I've seen Some little service, when my days were green,â And had the honour in the present fight, To war with Shelby for my country's right. What little I've acquir'd I'll free impartâ But all thy plans display a perfect art. Nothing I see to strengthen or amendâ But when complete, secure will they defend The passage from the foeâand lift on high The eagle-wing of heaven-born Liberty!â His plume-clad head each to the other bent, And wheel'd diverse. Adair, with bold intent, Carroll makes strongâwhile Jackson through the line Gives action to the wholeâthe whole combine Their labours to perfectâhalf reeking toil Through night's close darknessâhalf upon the soil, Their arms beside them, in pavilions restâ Courage imparting slumber to their breast. During six suns the Albion powers remain Behind their ramparts listless on the plainâ But on the seventh, fiend Cockburn makes the shoreâ Marines five thousand, constitute his power. Instant the tent of Packenham he seeks, And, without pausing, to the general speaks, While Gibbs and Lane, and Thornton, Lambert, Keene, In their full robes on either hand are seen. âBriton's proud Chief! the glory of her throneâ Second in fame to Wellington alone! Hearing disasters had befel your host, With sorted names I've landed on the coastâ Five thousand large in number from the fleet, To aid your strength the city to defeat. âI'd not be thought to sway you in command, Or plan th' attack to fight upon the landâ But then, a hint remote in season said, Will not unfrequent help the wisest head. âI find there's nothing brings our strength to bear, As some temptations to salute the fair. By that, at Hampton I the fight acquir'dâ Maddening the blood as though the heart were fir'd. Beauty and Bootyâwere the words I choseâ And soon they scatter'd from the field our foes. âTwice from their lines your veteran powers have fled, And once, surpris'd in darkness, join'd the dead. Except that something of the kind be done, Too soon we cannot from the shores be gone. If, when you fail'd, their works were incomplete, What prospect, marshall'd now, your strength to meet? But let this promise to the troops be made, And at thy feet their standards will be laid. âWe are impatient to behold your Grace, Install'd the royal Governor of the place, That we on Charleston may our weapons turn, And that proud city into ashes burn.â Cockburn concluded. Packenham replies, A flush'd excitement quickening in his eyes: âTerror of ocean! Death upon the tide! Your thoughts match mineâcomplete they coincide. Yesâsomething must be done. Your plan I'll try, Soon as new day shall glimmer in the sky. âGibbs, in the centre let your name shine forthâ Keene, with the right wing desolate the earth. Lambert, reserv'd your warriors will remain, To move, when I shall bid you to the plain. âReckless of death must we exert our might, And blind the Stars in ever-during night!â His tongue spoke confidence. They file away, To nerve their columns for the dreadful day. They fix fascines and ladders through the night, And shells, and rockets, to begin the fight. Scarce the faint glimmer of the morn was seen, Casting a doubtful light upon the green, When Packenham rode forth with feelings proud, So deep his columns:âThus with accents loud: âFirm is the English oak! Noneânone of earth, This day obstructs us in our moving forth! Behold, this day the strife of strifes we endâ Freedom in dust beneath our steel shall bend! Move to the battle with an iron tread, Should heaven's artillery burst upon our head! The man who fights this fight will honour gainâ Till time shall die his memory will remain! Nor honour's wreath alone shall deck your brow, When once ye triumph o'er yon breasted foe; Let Beauty, Booty, in the city there, Lighten your souls to strike them in despair. What spirit-giving charms!âwhat glorious boon! Inviting, yielding, in reclining swoon! Spoils, honours, raptures! theseâah, these are yours, When once ye pass the chain of Jackson's powers! How sweet, how tempting is the fruit!âhow fair! Do not your souls seem leaping to be there? Wind, wind your heart-chords to the tenor strain, And ye shall be there and the harvest gain. âThe strength is ours to conquer as we goâ Silent at first, but ere you strike the blow, Shout to the heavens! then, strong with thunder, chargeâ Booty and Beauty! England and Saint George!â As heaving clouds roll heavy from the north, So deep and dreadful move the myriads forth, Fix'd in their purpose never to return, Should smiting heaven against their madness burn. While these events were passing in their lines, The Jackson armyâ(finish'd their designs,) Stood breasted for the storm. Lo, now, in nightâ (The same the foe was mustering for the fight,) Just as day's harbinger reveals her light, They hear a bustle in the Albion camp Of neighing horses, and the heavy tramp Of feet innumerous. Every eye and ear Is bent with sharpen'd nerve to see, to hearâ Their blood like lightning hurries through their veins, To learn the tumult gathering on the plains. As hungry panthers pant to seize their prey, So pant the Patriots for the closing fray. Jackson, his soul's sublimity as fire, Visits the ranksâflaming their passion higherâ To this, to that, to every part he hies, Planning the death of all his enemies. Now as the morn with doubtful ray appears, His soul leaps forward to their listening ears: âFathers of virgin beauty! Deathless band! Patriotsâdefenders of your native land! The hour hath come your hearts' best blood to proveâ Deep o'er the plains their swarming thousands move! Dark-stain'd with acts of infamy they come, To strike back Freedom from her bosom'd home! Ruinâspoliatiousâmurky deeds of nightâ The torch of fireâcold massacres delight! No beam of honour shines upon their breastâ A cloud of pestilence to blight the West! Hope withers at their touchâMercy retires, Weepingâall the bless'd virtues man desires! Destruction's emissariesâsuckers of bloodâ Their deeds make hell cry out in horrid mood! Heaven gives them to our deaths! Yes, now's their doomâ A retribution for their crimes hath come! Worth, Honour, Justice, Liberty, and Fameâ Yea, all on earth that hath a sacred nameâ Will aid our efforts this eternal hour, To hurl defiance on the slaving power! âKeep lock'd in silence till close sight be givenâ Then bare your bosoms!âlet your souls reach heaven!â Lo, while the pouring of his soul went on, They stood like rocks cemented into one. They seem'd at times to mount above the spheres, As though divinity had touch'd their ears! While rapt in thought, lo, Victory in sight, Descendsâin likeness of an eagle's flight. Her ivory beak a written scroll contains, Which smooth unfurls as sails she o'er the plains. The letters edg'd with gold these words display: Thy land, Columbia! never shall decay! Lost in admiring, the defenders stand, And softly whisper: âGod protects the land!â Now all is silence on the battle heathâ No word, no whisperâsolemn, hush'd as death, The Britons heavy move with darkness slowâ Deepening and vast convulsions on their brow! Behold, the signal given!âa shout resounds Tearing the centre of creation's boundsâ Thousands on thousands dreadful join in one, As though the circle of old Time were done! So when th' Infernal with a serpent art, Struck death's cold arrow through the human heart, With smiles to please a ghostâfrom Eden's bowers, He went and gave the triumph to his powersâ His subjects heardâAt once the strength of hellâ Millions on millions shouted horribleâ Causing the universe of death to shake, And all the damn'd convulsively to quake: Like this the shoutings from the host reboundâ The cheek of heaven assaulting with the sound. The shouting done, they drive along with ireâ Instant the line of Jackson is on fire! Yet still they press in terrors clad severeâ The mouths of brass peal dreadful through the sphere. Pale death pursues the sound! still fierce they come, Reckless of death, which crowds them to the tomb. Balls, rockets stream, shells burst,âmortars explodeâ Thunders mix thunders, shaking heaven's abode: Thus when creation in crude silence dwelt, No cheering light, no heat ethereal feltâ The sun yet travelling in its orbit darkâ When lo, th' Eternal with a hollow spark, Touch'd it on fire! A wilderness of flame Leap'd into life, and fill'd the boundless frameâ Flash'd through the universe. Deep, with a sound Jarring creation from her depths profound, Thunder'd the conflagrating world. To view the scene, E'en Spirits crown'd with heaven shrunk back with fearful mien: So for the given space the scene was grand,â Like ridge of rocks Columbian warriors stand, And fill the plains with fire!âBig thunders rollâ The earth seems loosen'd from its fastenings whole! Death finds his riot: Packenham, Gibbs, Keeneâ A thousand others of their proudest men, Lie wrapp'd in gore! The vulgar load the plain, Causing the Earth to utter skrieks of pain. The Mississippi swell'd with curdling blood, Thickens:âSo vast the battle's magnitude, It bursts its banks! Thirteen mad lightnings plyâ Thirteen red thunders break along the sky! The few that dare to liveâthe remnant few, Fly from the carnage with their souls struck throughâ A whirlwind tempest sweeps them from the shore, Apast the ocean to be heard no more! The turbulence subsides. Clouds breakâbehold, What scenes of wonder to the sight unfold! Star-rob'd, Fredonia and her train descendâ What streams of gold upon their paths attend! Fame, eagle Vict'ry, Independence, Peace, Compose the circle touch'd with sunbeam grace. They break in numbersâHark! âColumbiaâlive! This day to thee eternity we give! Yea, let the tyrants of the world combine, Thy Stars shall burn with vital beams divine! Never this mottoânever let it dieâ Virtue, bless'd Freedom;âUnion, proud Liberty! FINIS.</field>
