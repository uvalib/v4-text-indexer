      <field name="fulltext">A CHORUS OF WAGNER From sheer-walled sunless mountain-gorge so deep That fierce-tongued torrents steal thence faint and sweet As meek-maid's laugh across the spangled wheat, Rambleth some shade-born monster up the steep, Dragging its fold, a coiled and clammy heap, Up, up the slant cliffs to the glory-seat Where rings on rings of circling angels beat From the clear air a rainbow's jewelled sweep. A hush intense—a sudden storm of rays Hurled clanging on the brute's sepulchral head— Dim bestial yellings—and a shrivelled, dead, Contorted horror clearing the abyss, One wild eye glaring—and a hateful hiss Plunging and splintering down the craggy ways. LIFE AND DEATH From the German One stroked the hair where yet the soft light played, Saying: ‘I would have loved her had she stayed.’ One turned with passionate sobbing to the wall: ‘So long to love, and this the end of all!’ One bent and kissed the mute lips with a smile: ‘Patience, sweet love, 'tis only for a while.’ THE PICTURE DRYAD—LAUGH in the eyes—just see The dewy lid with the sunlight snared In the mesh, and the primal woodland glee In the supple head-poise, firm and free, And the gladsome curve where the bosom's bared! Strange that it always serves them so; People dowered a thousand ways— Minds diverse as the shuttle-glow Of the sea, where the coral breaks its flow— Just the same—like a witch's gaze! Witch for him (so the story goes) Him the deep-eyed seer of dreams, Painter of gloried bits and gleams Of the over-world—ah! she held him close, And wound him round with her chains of rose Till she had him fast; bound hand and knee: His eye would follow till sight grew dim The silken shimmer of gown swept free By her lithe round limb—and she let him be And fed her heart on her hate for him. What time had he, while his brain was a-throng With dewy dreams, flush fancyings, Sly satyr-shapes in woodsy rings, Wan breasts a-glimmer in seas of song, To think of days had been dead so long? Besides 'twas scarce but a paltry hour In a heap of years—nor the thing so much; To crush a gnat that has spoiled your bower Of summer languor; it needs but a touch, Then back to your book, or lute, or flower. Ah! but the crushed gnat chanced to be What you call a man: then 'twere time to doubt: To be sure but a thing o' the fields, a clout, Only worth in this, he could breathe, and see, Even love, perhaps, between you and me. What, the face looks not so blithe, you think? Something stirs in a gloom apart, Flings arms out just to let them sink, Gropes and moans for the dry lips' drink, Gasps, and clutches the bursting heart? Yes, for listen! the thing's accursed; 'Tis a bit of hell in a gilded frame. What right had she—though her hate was flame, Though it gnawed at her heart's mid-core, and versed The whole round sky with her dead love's name From zenith sun to horizon line— What right had she to step smiling, twine Her sunny hair through the warp of his life? Were simple death not a vengeance fine? What right had she to forge Love for a knife? Could I solve the riddle? What, I, the crone With the shrivelled lip and the faded eye? Could I tell how the song-burst under the sky Broke and fluttered and sank to a moan? Perhaps I might—were the face not I. DANCE MUSIC (The King's Dwarf speaks.) Yes, I knew I need but beckon, though your silly bosom bled That you had to leave off dancing, you would follow where I led, That's what comes of telling secrets which might cost your dainty head. Perish all their ball-room music! with its sudden shouts and calls, With its trills like dryad's laughter, and its notes like bacchanals Having round a mossy hillock where the wind god laughs and lolls: For you needs must join the revel, and then presto! in a trice They have changed to hags of witches, with hooked heads and greedy eyes, Singing spells about a cauldron whence the fumes of hell arise! Give your soul up to such music, let your spirit drift and dream, You may fare a pretty journey: on you go where fawn's eyes gleam Slyly through the dark grape bunches, on where hamadryads scream. Pelting river-gods with oak-balls, on where great white cities be With their feet thrust in the ocean and their arms flung drowsily Over hills that scarcely breathe for fear the dozers start and sigh: On you walk through stately gardens, palace porches, corridors, Blazing halls as full of candles as the sky is full of stars, And for every light a reveller who wears a mask that bars All his forehead's ghastly meaning till some maiden masterful Beckons to you, so you follow where the lamps burn blue and dull; Then she turns and takes her mask off, and you see a grinning skull. Brain-sick fancies, do you call them? Call them any name you dare, Only hear that hautboy shouting, ‘What have we to do with care?’ ‘Youth is ours and love and laughter: twine us roses for our hair!’ ‘Twine her roses, longing lover, for her hair is softer gold ‘Than the eyes of eastern idols in their stony sockets hold.’ But the anxious viol whispers, ‘Dwells a dragon on the wold; ‘Dwells a dragon by the forest; let thy love go never near, ‘Lest the sea-green lustful eye-balls and the twisting claw appear ‘Through the tree stems where she lingers, and thy love go mad with fear. ‘Dwells a dragon by the castle; let thy love's glance never fall ‘Where the brazen gates lie open, lest she see the monster crawl ‘Through the courtyard to the portal of the very banquet hall.’ Then the horn begins to question: ‘What has made her eyes so wild? ‘Did you kiss her warm as ever, and she never moved or smiled? ‘Dare you turn and face the horror, fold on scaly fold up-piled?’ But you smile and tap your slipper to the tune the fiddlers play, And you think it strange such music should seem anything but gay; ‘How the swift notes rush and sparkle, like a mountain brook,’ you say; ‘How they leap and laugh and tumble till that wildest plunge of all ‘Breaks them to a mist of silver that has hardly weight to fall, ‘To the tarn that sleeps far under, rimmed with cedars like a wall.’ But they fall at last!—yes, listen, did my senses play the fool? Why did those slow ripples widen through the basin brown and cool? I heard whispers when that drowned face stirred the surface of the pool ‘But a wretched dwarf’ (your eyes hint) ‘gnarled and shrunk as mountain yew.’ ‘Joys escape such?’—nay, I answer, had God made me fair like you I could never dance to music as these dunces choose to do. 'Tis too dreadful: that dim minor startled at the ball-room glare, With its starved hands clutched convulsive in its tangled mass of hair, Does it stand and wonder at them? I could vow I saw it there! Saw it there? Saw twenty rather, wraiths of women such as trod Measures blithe as those your fan beats, never knew the lips of God Blew them warning in the flute notes—till they sank beneath the sod. Now they know it: that's the reason why they plead so with their hands As the dancers circle past them. See that faintest one who stands By the wall and weeps her heart out that no dancer understands! A SICK-ROOM FANCY Out of the broken life, The choking tomb; Out of the storm and strife, The glare and gloom— (Sad heart, 'tis meant for thee, Take thou the prophecy) Beauty and bloom. What finger can unwind All subtle threads that bind Body and soul and mind? What thought may stand and say ‘Thus flies the shade away?’ What knowledge may scan The unimagined plan, Saying ‘Cannot’ and ‘Can’? How dewy fresh it keeps, The little wilding flower, In the glass beside the bed. See, he no longer sleeps But turns his weary head And gazes at the flower; Sunburst of glad surprise Brimming the sunken eyes. A soul is in the rose— Her gentle soul, who knows? Which, bound by Death's dread law, Yet could not quite forego Love's presence, haply saw The flower-form, used it so. A soul is in the rose— Her gentle soul, who knows? Waiting the time to rest Upon the pallid breast Of him, the loved and best: (Placed there by one who knew Their secret, and was true) So, hand in hand, lip on lip, All circling bonds to slip; So leave the twilight room, One breath of vague perfume; Out to immensity. Starlight and sky and sea, Wandering, while on while, Nearer that argent isle Which from the dawn of time, Gemmed in seas hyaline, Wrapped in a cloudless clime, Bird-song, bee-humming, Ever through soft sky-shine Bided their coming. Languid eyes trying If they can see Through chest of dying Life's verity. Truth weareth strange guide; Follow thy fancy! Ere they must close Comfort the dying eye, Thus, little rose. THE ANSWER You will give me gems an island king Hung in a hill-maid's hair To pleasure him in the lacing light Of red and blue on her brow's moon-white While she danced before him half the night? And silks so palpitant with sun Of eastern afternoons One clad therein might walk through halls Where not one lamp-ray lights the walls As through streets flush with festivals? Nay! I've three roses for my hair: And one was plucked at morn— This bud with petals pure as snow Save where a timid eager glow Of blush pink stains the midmost row. And this great creamy half-blown one Was plucked the self-same noon; Seeing the closed leaves who would guess The flame it feeds and cherishes, Deep down, see, where my fingers press? And this red rose was plucked at night; This blown rose, burning red, Where every petal flaunts to view The very precious inmost hue And secret soul of the other two. Nay! Find some other woman's brow To hang your jewels on; Have I not roses for my hair? I know your silks are strange and rare, But—O, the robe God lets me wear! ANGELLE I (Count Bertram speaks.) Was it not glorious? the street One blaze of banners, flags, and flowers, The stone bridge to my charger's feet Made soft with woven stuffs, white showers Of roses from the crowded roofs Left him no spot to plant his hoofs That was not snowed knee-deep with bloom Plucked by our burgher-girls to crown Me, who dared bid the old proud town, Bowed low so long in wrath and gloom, Rise up and shake her neck and feel Fall off the riven ring of steel. My life's one dream had come about; Our town was free; Duke Leon dead; In five days I should go to wed His daughter, and so wipe quite out The old stain, banish every trace Of the old hatred and disgrace. Why was it then, that when I threw My glance to one low balustrade, The whole rich city seemed to fade Before a mere girl's face, that drew All meaning from the earth and skies And held it in her lips and eyes? A streak of sunlight sifting through The gnarled magnolia's rose pink dome Above the wall, cared not to roam The musky under-glooms of blue, When once it found and kissed to flame The hair that held her face in frame. Did twenty thousand people strain Their throats, my name on high to raise? It all seemed cheap beside the praise Her calm brow gave me, while a band Of white-robed boys placed in my hand The broidered banner of our land. Only a moment one may guess, The spell had strength to hold me: then I rose up. I was lord of men Who freed my city from distress; Round me my grateful people bowed— And she was one face in the crowd. A face to stare at, doubtlessly, And I almost a stranger, so I plucked Count Armon's sleeve to know Her name and state. He screened his eye With one broad gauntlet from the sun: ‘Angelle, the sole uncloistered nun ‘Our town boasts,’ laughed he, ‘calm and cold As marble martyr in her niche: 'Twas she who worked your banner's rich, Soft blazoning. A shame, I hold, Such eyes should dim their violet fire On paltry needle-work, for hire!” That task at least (I dared have said) Was not for hire: each burning thread Which caught the sun above my head Was stained her very heart's core red. Each stitch, I knew, had been a prayer, Each pin thrust a thanksgiving, there. How had I thought to ride away! About me birds and brooks and bees, Above me milk-white orchard trees, And in my heart a tune so gay The quail's low drum, the throstle's throat, Were discord to its meanest note. And now—how leans her cheek death pale Against her idle wheel tonight? What deems she of earth's bale and blight, Of all earth's bitter blight and bale? Three days, and then I ride away— Why has my bread turned stone, I say? II (It is the evening of the second day after. Angelle speaks.) Ah, dearest, here is a sight of sights To stop one's weeping: only see, Three blood-red blooms on my cactus tree Tonight of all the nights! My cactus waited a winter through To bloom, for an end it had in mind; My heart, deep hid in its lifeless rind, It had its purpose, too. Tomorrow doubtless the blooms will fall, Only a broken stem remain Of the bright like blood and the dim like rain Wrapped up in the lucent ball: But the stalk will cherish, I dare avow, The daylong pride of its diadem; I shall not forget that I wore a gem Two nights on my worthless brow. Two long, long nights, from dusk to dusk! Is not that much? I ask no more. My heart would burst did a third night pour Its chrismal flame and musk. Last week my heart was as cold and dead As the glass-green stem of my cactus-tree; Last night on a sudden one, two, three Buds burst out warm and red. Tomorrow doubtless the blooms will fall, Only a broken stem remain Of the bright like blood and the dim like rain Wrapped up in the lucent ball: But the stalk will perish, I dare avow, The daylong pride of its diadem; I shall not forget that I wore a gem Two nights on my worthless brow. III (Obelin, a vagabond minstrel, continueth his tale before the Abbess.) Had I the art Fra Gochil knows, I'd paint, not tell you, the story's close; The grace and pomp of the tourney shows! Mere words can ne'er suffice to tell Of the great lists shaped like a scallop shell, Where they fought three days for the silver bell. When the count brought home his just-wed bride He hung a silver bell by the side Of the throne where she sat languid-eyed, To watch the gallant jousting game; And he challenged every knight who came To tilt for the prize in his lady's name. And on the third day came a knight With blue shield moon-shape, star bedight, So all clapped hands at the gracious sight. Behind his visor all saw glare Such eyes as shine from a wild beast's lair, The queen leaned forward from her chair. Our count laughed up as he took his lance Some jest to his bride with the brows askance: He never dreamed of the deed's mischance. Steel clashed on steel in a storm of sound: Dust cleared: our count lay on the ground, Pierced through the breast with a mortal wound: While over him, with bared head, stood Dead Leon's son, our foe. ‘God's rood!’ He cried, ‘here wash I out in blood ‘The shameful bond that linked my race To his: behold how I erase The stain and cancel the disgrace!’ Then fell a strange thing: from her throne The bride came down, her wild hair blown About her, all her pale face grown One fire, and all her soul one thirst To bind the bonds that her kinsman burst, And keep her faith—come best or worst: When who should burst in through the ring About the wounded knight, who fling His wife one side, and sink and cling About his form with moanings wild— But just that maid we townsfolk styled Angelle, the saintly and undefiled? Who (we loved to say) heard Heaven's own hymn As her faced yearned out of its hair's soft rim, Too gold for a lover's breath to dim: With the brow too white neath the parted strands For aught but the brow of the saint who stands With the young Christ clinging to both her hands. We had worshipped her as we worshipped God,— And lo! she lay on the earth like a clod, A common thing, to be spurned and trod! Next day when the funeral train went through The great bridge gate, the people knew Who walked behind, brow-bound with rue, Blackvested, and with muffled face, And the women moralled, knitting their lace, Of her deadly sin and its swift disgrace. IV The nuns rose up and left the room: The abbess sat in the purple gloom. The minstrel let the lute-notes fail, Then turned in question of the tale. ‘How shameful that no purest life Is free from fleshly sin and strife! ‘If punishment were yours to tell What had you meted the maid Angelle?’ The abbess let her stern gaze fall On the wan white Christ in the shadowed wall. ‘If I had sought some way to win To show my hate of her deadly sin ‘I had gone bare-head and with naked feet And held her hand through the crowded street.’ THE AMBER-WITCH I went across the twilight moor, Through pine woods purply glimmering, I heard, not half a league before, The glad sea sing. The glad, glad sea sang low to me, And low I answered, stooping blind Through brake and bough, till every tree Lay dark behind. From out the moon-soaked sleepy sands, With vacant laughter, like a fool, The sea had scooped with his two hands A green, green pool. All naked on a pale green stone, Where circling water-snakes burned rich, Sat waiting, eager-eyed and lone, The amber-witch. She drew my head upon her knee; About my body everywhere The bright snakes burned, and over me Drooped her wild hair. Her body swayed into a tune, Her lips were writhen as with pain, Her eyes swam dim while she did croon A dim, dim strain. I stooped into the wood black-pined, I startled at the moon-bright moor, I heard, not half a league behind, The mad sea roar. The mad sea clamored hoarse on me, And nought I answered, lest the moon Should let her amber hair float free, And stoop, and croon. THE LADY OF THE FOUNTAIN King Arthur sat at Carleon upon Usk At Christmas feast, and one by one, the knights Had told them each his tale of wonder-deed Or wonder-vision, till the circle came Unto Owain, the silent dreamer he, Though like a storm in battle. All had turned For wonder at his silence, for he sat With eyes wide-fixed and staring, as he saw Beyond the flame of jewels, flash of silk, And blaze of burnished metal of the room, Something the others saw not. As they sat A gate clanged; on the stone-paved outer court Quick hoof-beats rang; the door burst open wide; Into the hall and to the very board There rode a lady, clad in clinging silk Flame-colored, and her horse like summer cloud Piled in the west at noon-day, save the mane Pale saffron, and the nostrils poppy-red. Nor spake she any word, but by Owain Halted, and drew off the ring she wore, Then loud enough so all within the room Could hear the words, hissed, ‘Beardless! traitor! fool! Shame of all knighthood! shame of all mankind!’ Then turned her steed and vanished. Long they sat, Nor dared to look upon Owain, for fear To see the change such speech had wrought in him, The choice-culled flower of gentlest chivalry, Thus trodden in the dust and spit upon. Saddest of all was Arthur, for he loved The high-browed youth who came but yesterday To prove him worthy of the Table Round, And his heart yearned unto him, and he said: ‘Tell us, I pray thee, thou our newest friend, The meaning of the sight that we have seen. Frankly we ask it, for we know right well The meaning is not such a one as seems.’ Then lifted up Owain his sunken head And spake unto them: Now recounteth Owain how that in his wanderings he did come one day at noon upon a marble basin, in the centre of a fair valley; whereof when he would have drunk, a knight arose from the reed-flags to give him battle concerning it. Then did Owain slay that knight, being moved thereto by his great thirst and longing for the cool water. When now he had gazed long upon the dead, was he seized of a strange fancy, that he did off his helm and corslet and put on the armor of the other, together with a fair ring that was upon his finger. Which done, he looked into the pool and saw that his face had suffered change, being no more his own, but so like unto the dead knight's face that it was a marvel to him. Thereupon he spied a horse tethered near by in the wood, and when he had mounted, it bare him of his own will through that valley into a gated town, even unto the portals of a great palace. Continueth the story after this wise: And as I walked along the lofty hall, Such magic lay within the mail I wore, All was familiar to me, yet all strange. A greyhound licked my hand, I stroked his head And called him by his name; a lazy page Teasing a falcon gained his sharp reproof; The very faces of the tapestry, The twisting dragons of the panelled walls, Met me with a most wondrous wontedness, So I must stop and say: ‘Owain art thou, Forget not, thou'rt Owain!’ So as I walked, Pondering the strangeness of the things that fell, There came a sense of voices near at hand. Beneath me, in the flower-filled central court, I saw a maid beside a tiny lake Feeding the swans; upon the balustrade Above her leaned an ape-faced swarthy dwarf, His green eyes large with some discovery, Mighty of portent. Straight I hid me there, And listened while he told with cunning glee How he had stolen to their lady's room, All in the sleepy heat of afternoon, And heard her murmur secrets as she slept, About the wondrous fountain in the dell, And call upon the nixie of the spring, Naming her mother, and a hundred names Of soft endearment, so the dwarf was like To burst with laughter at the thought of it, Their pretty lady with the haughty brows Born of a nixie, of a water-fay! Then, with one lean hand by his pursed mouth, And leaning low across the balustrade, With sly-arched brows, he said the best was yet: 'Twas not for love the wedding-bells should ring Next morning when their lady wed her lord, But he was strong in fight, and he alone Could guard the fountain where the nixie dwelt From every comer. I could hear no more, But I had heard so much as filled my veins With longing and with laughter, and I went Along the lofty sounding corridors, Past massy columns twined with silver snakes, Through gloomy doors where red-gold lions crouched, Their heads upon their paws, until I came Unto a dim-lit chamber, where were maids Twenty and one, more fair than Guinevere When Guinevere was fairest, Easter day. They sat beneath the yellow light of reeds Working some wondrous piece of needlecraft, And in their midst sat one so beautiful It stopped the heart's beat but to look on her. Against the dark green woof her dainty head Drooped goldenly; her slim hands clasped her knee, All heedless how the busy maidens wrought, In threads of silk upon a tapestry, Christ's passion and the raising of the Host. Long time I stood in utter wonderment, For love of that sweet face and queenly hair Against the green woof drooping goldenly; Then turned, and felt my way along the halls Unto the portals. And three pages came, And led my charger through the moonlit streets Unto a mighty castle on a hill. Here recounteth Owain how that at morning servants came to put on him raiment for his marriage; and he suffered them to do their will. But the shirt of mail would he not put off, for fear to lose the spell which made like unto that other. Then fared he in a great company to the church, and was married to the lady he had seen, being too full of lust and fleshly evil to know that deed for a wrong. And ever after wore he the magic shirt, save in secret, and each day went he to guard the fountain, as he had been no other than he who did aforetime that service. But after a tide waxed he weary of his life, for the secret troubled him, and he began to hate his bride, thinking her not a human creature, but one born of a sprite. So one day he went not to the fountain, but wandered all day in the forest, right heavy of heart. Nathless at night did he return, and lay down beside that fair lady that he had taken to wife. Continueth the story after this wise: At midnight I awoke: the mellow moon Lay everywhere; within the tangled vine Outside the painted pane a nightingale Poured out his passionate heart; and as I lay A change came over me. I was as one Who feels a leprous sickness ooze away Out of his limbs and eyeballs at Christ's touch. Again I saw my fair bride's dainty head Against the woof of green droop goldenly, All halo-rimmed with utter loveliness. Again I walked beside her where old saints Yearned from dim-blazoned windows, while the choir Chanted aloft the bridal symphony; And in her eyes, upturned to meet mine own, There was a startled splendor, as she felt Love bursting rose-like where hate's thorns had been; For through the borrowed semblance that I wore Her spirit subtly felt the soul of me, And rose to meet it like a very bride. So as I lay and thought such thoughts of her, Within my heart arose a hungering To clasp her in my arms and with great love Wipe out her bitter wrong: and with a cry I turned unto her. Lo! the moonlight fell Bright on the pillow where her head had lain, But she was gone. I gazed about the room, But all was silent. Only the glad bird Outside the window panted out his song, Until its gladness grew a ghostly thing More sad than sorrow. Full of choking fear I stole along the dim-lit corridors, Peered into niches, listened long at doors, Until the thought came over me to go And seek her by the fountain in the dell. Through the bright streets and misting country lanes, Like to a guilty spirit I stole on, Fearing to find what I most longed to see. But when I drew anigh unto the slope That leadeth to the well, a bright, sharp laugh Made my veins ache with horror: crouching down, I looked between the thronging slant-stemmed trees, Into a little marshy bed of reeds, Made by the o'erflowing well. There lay my bride, Her white and naked body green with slime, Her gold hair bound with pale-blue water snakes, Which, knotted in the centre, on her brow Let fall for pendant gem a wide-mouthed frog. About her limbs and waist, huge fold on fold, A striped snake reached as far as to her breast, And ended in a wrinkled human head, Glaring and witch-like, with eyes pale as flame Under the dripping crown of water weeds. With low, glad cries my lady fondled it, And on the livid mouth and one black fang Pressed eager kisses. I could bear no more, But tearing off the magic coat of mail, Which changed my semblance into him I slew, I turned and fled into the mighty wood, And fled and fled until my brain was gone, So that I slept with wolves, while noisome things Crept o'er me as I lay without the will To brush them from my face. O gentle king! The lady who burst in upon our feast Was she I wed deceitfully: and now, Seeing that I have sinned a bitter sin, And am no longer worthy in men's sight To sit beside you at the Table Round, Grant me to go, and struggle, if I may, To free from witchery and evil spells The life I should have cherished to the end, With all the potence of pure chivalry. Thus speaking, with head sunken low, Owain Went from the Christmas feast at Carleon. APPLAUSE Under the chandelier's blaze See how they listen and gaze. Listen, their eyes growing tender, Gaze, while the magical splendor My music spreads in their skies Flushes and sparkles and dies. I, who have wrought them the wonder, What do I care for their cries, Plaudits, and loud-clapping thunder? All that I care for is yonder: A strip of brow in the dotted maze, One loosened strand cutting through it, and under, Blown by a rapture of gladness asunder, Thrilling me through with an exquisite praise, Her two eyes. THE BRIAR ROSE I ‘O low strange hills,’ the minstrel said, ‘O low hills sad against the sun, O starved trees where the moon hangs dead, What plains are these, so vast and dun, Ere my long way be over-won? ‘What snarls of wicket weed and grass Clutch at my lute and bridle reign? What dull bird cryeth as we pass? Through what more lonely lands of pain Dost lead me, O blind quest and vain? ‘Slow, slow my steed, thy hoof-hold slips, The way grows brambled, roofed and wet; The air tastes sweet upon my lips!’ And as he peered out, fear-beset, The roses held him like a net. II In loop and shaft and intertwine, Sprang domed and pillared from the swamps The ancient tangle of the vine; Through purple vistæd underdamps The ripe-heart roses shone for lamps. Couched low among the crowding stems A slumbrous people suffered wrong, Hoar kings brow-girt with ancient gems, Dark breasts of warriors, scarred and strong, And throats of boys laid bare for song. And as the wandering minstrel stood, With terror was his spirit wrung, To hear within the darkling wood The sweet low hissing of the tongue Wherewith these grievous folk were stung. But unto longing was his heart As shawn unto the shawn-player; The thronging thicket yearned apart, The lamping flowers as torches were To light him on his way to her. And silver lauds and trumpetings Made festival along his veins, ‘Lo, many vassals, many kings, Love curses utterly and banes, But one, oh, at last attains!’ III Upon her threshold he was fain To pause, till from the richer glooms His eye might some clear vision gain, And saw within the rush-strewn rooms The maids asleep beside their looms. Through worn leads of the lattice panes The stealthy briar boughs had crept, And shed their red and yellow rains Upon the floor, and overleapt The warp-frames where the weavers slept. Within the middle of the bower The red moon through the vine lacings Was sifted in a dreamy shower, About a web's old picturings Of slant horns and triumphant wings. Against the web angelical, Where long ago, grown weary weak, She drooped and let the shuttle fall, Still drooped she, and her eyelids meek Still darkened on his patient cheek. And as the minstrel gazed at her, The forms upon the arrased wall Seemed to take note of him and stir; King leaned to bearded seneschal, And spectral wrath was on them all. He thought of her uplifted eyes, How they would pierce his spirit's core With their importunate surmise; And knew that death would be less sore Than the still wonder that they wore. Upon his soul vain sorrow burst— A phantasy, a sick man's whim; The overweening love that durst Conceive such bliss would be for him Smote him with shame in every limb. He saw his weary life outspread, With all its grey and graceless days, When for a dole of bitter bread He had been fain, in hollow lays, To sing a mindless tyrant's praise. His childhood's trust seemed as a bough Uncomforted of bud or leaf, His boyhood's pride a poor hedge row Of ragged thorn, and manhood's grief A stony field without a sheaf. So where he knelt he dared not touch Her garment's hem; but seeing how His soul was drowsy overmuch, And it seemed nigh as sweet to bow, And sleep her sleep while time should flow,— With quiet murmur over him He let the lapping water close; And as he sank from dream to dream Through shuttled depths of green and rose, Where peace like branching coral grows, He smiled to think how she would wake, And say, ‘How changed is all the place! My minstrel here for my poor sake Has slept right long, and now, for grace, I cannot recollect his face!’</field>
