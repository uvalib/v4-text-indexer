      <field name="fulltext">LIFE. Life sparkles with poetic gleamings, As Heaven with lucent stars. Unto the deeper dreamings Of the soul's solitude, fresh bars Of tenderest music bring A delicate nourishment, As to our inmost virtue sing Chorals, of angel voices blent. The Powers that launch a human soul On life's eternity, On towards a boundless goal, Joy with creative glee, Mid supersolar lights, Mid unapproachable mights, Whose will peoples th' infinitudes of space, Whose playthings are wild comets' fiery race. Children of light are we and truth, Luminaries, to beam for aye In an unwrinkled youth; Untouched by sour decay, When once we be uprisen Above this earthen prison, Loaded no more with flesh, erect and glad We soar, buoyant and free, only with spirit clad, Towards cleaner, wiser thought ever to mount, Upbuoyed by Love, that streams, From unimaginably holy fount, Through all our doings, fancies, dreams, Purging them of their stains And red, impassioned pains, In God's soft arms enfolded we: This is our possible destiny. Truth watches us with sleepless eye From far, superimperial throne, Set deeper in the glittering sky Than the one constant star who all alone Guides our dark courses on the sea,â One of Truth's raptured servants he,â While she, puissant in primal dower, Sways the whole universe with God's unmeted power, And hand in hand with her twin-sister, Love, Together they enclasp the naked moth And planets and the steadfast suns above, And all that throbs, e'en to the froth That rides a moment on the billow's back, Illuming the dim caverns of remorse, Lighting life ever on its shadowed track, Missing no birth, and smiling on the birthful corse. Th' invisible Heaven unresting weaves Around, within us life's quick web With threads finer, more beautiful than sheaves Of light forth from her eyes by midnight shed. And what a gift is human life! To be a new immortal spirit! Wooed by th' eternities, that it grow rife The bliss and beauties of angelic good t' inherit. Around, above, within us beat,â Inaudible to earthen senses,â Th' eternal pulses of creative heat Aye wreathing spiritual recompenses, For which, through holy fires that in us burn, We with a sane forefeeling yearn, We the choice children of all-folding Might: Not compassed round with darkness are we, but with light. DEATH. Life's loving brother, indefatigable Death, Keeps Life alert and young. Without him, Life's sweet breath, Rank and unbreathable through healthy lung, Would sicken Life himself, that, pale As frighted sky in an eclipse, His eyes grow blear, his spirits fail, Smiles vanish from his leaden lips, And, shuddering in a dull despair, To see matter's unchecked increase, Would shriek towards Heaven a piteous prayer That he might quick decease, Ere he be suffocated by His offspring. They, up piled in monstrous mounds,â Now that they cannot die,â No longer know or beauty, grace, or bounds; In unproportioned crowds of lurid life Pressing each other for more room, Wrangle in unavailing strife, Faith and Hope waning in the gloom Exuded from usurping matter; The watchful angel no more there to shatter Its tightening fetters, hopeless age Wailing in swarms of slow decrepitude, Impotent to die, and thus elude The shocks of helpless rage At its imprisonment on earth,â Earth in soiled ragged gray enwrapt, Of its dear greenery unsapt, Grown to a gross material Hell, Where never more is heard the knell Of a new liberating birth; Boyhood outnumbering childhood, manhood both, While age, more numerous than all the three, Gasps in imbecile sloth, Cursing its heavenly privilege to be. Banish good Death, and all things soon In agony would pray For his recall, to lift them out of swoon, To free them from deathless decay. Aye, Heaven's brave minister is he, The world's unwearied cleanser, Divine in his ubiquity, Of freshness and of sweetness the dispenser, Unresting key that is forever Opening the bridal bloom of spring! Triumphant spirit, that dost seem to sever The body thou renew'st and dost re-wing. Gross earthy thoughts have made the scythe Thy symbol, with grim skeleton, and skull Grinning in mockery of life. A blithe Ethereal figure, beautiful As a May-dawn, or peeping pink Of the first rose, or maiden's blush, Or boreal joy's ecstatic flush,â These were fit symbols for earth's beautifier, Man's lifter to th' angelic choir; For thou, thou art the link Twixt life and life. Dear Death! loud hail to thee! Thou holy handmaid of eternity! All nature keeps itself alive by dying,â Seeming to die; bodies even die not, They do but change; for spirit is ever plying Creative power; and so from rankest rot Of matter life upsprings, Exulting in fresh wings, Breathing with a new breath Inbreathed from high beneficence: THERE IS NO Death. SPRING. Late art thou, but to come thou couldst not fail, Divinest minister of the divine. Firstling of the great Sun, we hail Thy bounteous plenitude of green, Sprung from the deep mysterious mine Of life, unfathomable and unseen. Thou floodst our hearts with beauty from the bloom Of thy young, happy face, And from our thoughts their gloom With virgin joyousness dost chase, And tremulous glee of flowering trees, With whose fresh beauties the caressing breeze Dallies, showering sweet breath into the air, And sunny kisses, with bold stealth Seizing their vernal perfumes rare, Enriching nature with her own new wealth. This sudden sun-born burst Of leafy life all round our earth, Quick resurrection of hushed nature, hearsed In winter's crypt, this bright rebirth, This universal blossoming, This certain strangling of cold death By the warm Herculean breath Of the reviving Spring In her old earthen cradle,âthis Rhythmic renewal of deep nature's bliss, Is token from th' all-loving and all-seeing Of man's reblossom'd joy in a perennial being. GARIBALDI. Again is Italy summoned to mourn, Yet with a thankful cheerfulness, That her loved Hero is upborne When the high work, 't was his to bless His country with, is done. Distracted Italy is one, United, self-directing, free Of foreign force, while he,â One of her saviors, who As child could bravely save an adult life, And, foremost of a patriot crew, Spent a stout manhood in ennobling strife,â Ascended to his burnished seat Blest by full hearts, which he had swelled With freemen's blood and made to beat With pulses that had quelled Fierce tyrannies. The famous man Passed calmly on, more reverenced, more dear, To a new, thankful nation than Any son living. 'Bove his bier All the past greatness shone of Italy; All souls that through the struggling ages Had boldly fostered her high destiny, The men who live in consecrated pages, Whom we that breathe outside the warm confines Of Alps and Apennines, Study for high enlightenment And stouter bracing of our souls,â Pages whence the new hardiment Of hero or of thinker rolls Upon us waves of strength and thought: These gloried ones shine there in circles wrought Of superearthly splendor, quick to greet, With heavenly salutation meet, Their Garibaldi, him who, single-handed, Had wrested from the tyrants 'gainst him banded Populous Naples and broad Sicily, And given them to triumphant Italy: Cavour, Mazzini, who so well In his large soul foredrew the nation's span, Victor Emmanuel, The patriot King, and man So true, that he deserved to be King of emancipated Italy; Manin, and many others who With heart-beat strong and true, Had spent them for their country's good. To him these were the nearest, Yet hardly were they dearest, So many had outpoured their blood To enrich with freedom a lov'd land. The aspiring Poets all were there. Poets are patriots by command Of love, warmed by the ideal glare Which lights their being. Alfieri the proud, Who sang of liberty, with a stern pen Straight'ning the souls of crouching countrymen, To lone, sublimest Dante, whom the shroud Of exile could not deaden, but he soared On flashing pinion from Hell's lowest story, Through thickly peopled Purgatory, High up to saintly Beatrice the adored. All came who with the glow of beauty Illuminate their land through Art, Or clasp her in the motherly arms of duty. Savonarola took close part Beside Da Vinci, Angelo, Raphael; Heaven-widening Galileo hand in hand Hovered with Titian. The strong spell Of the new glory swelled the crowded band With great Antiquity, when Rome Was Europe. Came from highest home The Brutuses and Cicero, Long clean of anger, pain, and woe, True Scipios and Antonines, All glittered round Caprera's sea-set lines. With lightning looks of exultation, Outshining earth-drawn ecstasy,â Looks of emancipation,â Amid seraphic melody, Too piercing pure for mortal's ear, With glow, as of rainbows intermingled, Great Garibaldi tenderly outsingled, Heavenward with jubilant joy they steer; Him, now to immortal spirit-figure moulded, They loving waft aloft in angel-arms enfolded. ASPIRATION. Th' innumerable Suns that star the vault We wonder in, when our own Sun Unrolls mysterious night, assault The soul with such sublimities, they stun Our earthly thinkings. When we strain Feeling and thought to seize their meanings, We vivify the brain With quick creative gleamings, And these, speaking with voice of solar light, Unveil a supersolar Might. Man's thought can never grasp, But his high feeling can enclasp This Might. With the spirit of the whole Can swell and bound the soul, For of infinitude we are, And towards the farthest star Can speed ourselves in happy awe, Seize its eternal law, And feed great yearnings. We Are parcel of eternity, A portion of all that we feel and see; Not th' outward world alone, but Deity Mirrors itself upon the procreant brain, That glowing centre of circumferences Unlimited, where endless is our gain. Spirit is never subject unto fences, But with devout elation Moves through the brightening brightness of creation. Man can reflect this brightness Because of the inward rightness Of his deep nature. He longs for the better; His true nobility chafes at the fetter Of bondman, aiming to be freer, On ever higher, purer, to uprear His being. And in his puissant self Is the divinity that aye protests 'Gainst pressures that would lay him on the shelf Of apathy, foiling his high behests. He is a wingÃ©d creature, his wings beating Invisibly the air, to lift him To higher ranges, thus defeating The lower; he aye longs to sift him Of gross carnalities, and mount Towards spirit's primal fount, Struggling to obey his soul's attraction From mouldy sloth to polished action, Inwardly mourning when dull vice Embraces him in its constrictive ice. At times, amid the passions devilish Of a bad man, upshoots a holy wish, Like infant's chirp within a robber's cave, That circumfuses all The father's heart, melting the pall Of evil; or like a single star,âwhen rave The tempest's demons,âthat peeps through the storm's Cold blackness, and the sailor's heart rewarms. Life should be a curriculum of prizes: Man is the more himself the more he rises: 'T is his angelic instinct to aspire: Manhood must mount, from low to high, from high to higher. TRUTH. In the hale birth-throes of first being Was born this God, this bold, all-seeing, All-beautifying Truth, This old, eternal Youth. A universal presence, He rides upon the Sun's fierce beams, He floats among the Sea's calm dreams; His birthful breath makes nature's crescence. A thousand stars glow in his eye; Quintessence of divinity, God calls him when he doth create; He in creation hath no mate. Without him man were less than beast, And life a tasteless, hopeless feast. Loosen Truth's hold on human thought, Shadow his splendor in the feeling, And, like a painted savage caught By cruel potions, man goes reeling. In the broad brain Truth quires As lightning in the air, When, leaping from his cloudy lair, Stagnation he with motion fires. Man's quenchless guardian-light, Truth pilots him through wreckful night, And should he stumble into crime, Uplifts him with a call sublime. Truth is man's spiritual Sun, Older, more luminous, than the one We walk by in Time's small periphery, Our beaming monitor through all Eternity. IDEAL. In what a nest of love and joy, And holy mystery, He lay, the baby boy! Hope in her heavenliest glee Hovering, and pouring from above Sparkles into the eyes of joy and love. A soul-bud, beautiful As angel's smile on the dawn beaming, Life, mighty life, astreaming Through him in currents full Of perfumed promise, his soft breathing To firmer beauty roseate limbs awreathing; For the great Sun looks on him lovingly, Ripening the finer elements of air To mould him to proportion's grace, while He Who moulds the Sun, and hath creative care Of universal being, Freights his new breath with subtle filaments That speed, like lightning to our seeing, To the brain, building with fire its vast contents, Sowing it with the seeds Of crownÃ©d thoughts and deeds, Making it exquisitely rife With all the fragrancies of life. His daily living grows to be One long unbroken blossoming, And like some tropic tree, Unstung by frost's cold sting, In prodigal opulence Outthrowing mingled sweet incense Of flower and fruit from the same branch, New, generous plans bloom near to staunch Nutritious deeds. But he is still a child Springing toward youth from station To station, on the strong faith lifted Of fearless expectation; And ever undefiled, For that young spirit is so gifted With human upward swing That in his brain is plied Triumphantly Life's subtlest skill In moulding individual will. Pure as the thoughts of modest bride, Or consciousness that good deeds bring, Are his desires. Like lofty spires Upstreaming in the sky From solid sure foundations, They mount; not groveling in a sordid sty, But in their swift mutations Are so unselfed that angels hear them, Taking delight to come down helpful near them. The warm tempestuous straits That palpitating youth sails through He passed unscathed amid the baits Of fragrant sensualities untrue, Above his head unconsciously unfurled,â Daunting th' hypocrisies of the world,â The hallowed flag of innocence. He entered manhood's strenuous path, Invigorated by the intense Clean strength of youth's elastic bath. Fresh life he drew from a so fervent power, It strengthened, sweetened, sanctified each hour. Welcome as scented breeze In spring, mysterious as the light Of silent stars, resistless as decrees Of Fate, and with the might Of deepest heave of Ocean, Cometh, flame-crested, the warm wave Of love, flooding with rapturous emotion, And with imaginings so bold and brave, His being's core, that he feels recreated, As with a larger soul dilated. And now his life put on its earnestness. The titles, husband, father, were a claim His fellows had that he should bless His household with th' ascending flame Kindled by countrymen's and neighbor's prayer For its victorious weal. His manhood shone in thoughtful care Of largest interests, such as deal With the mind's loftiest life, and with Sound enterprises, of such pith They strengthen while they purge The vital currents of communities. His hopes, sprung from the purest deeps Of intuition, bore him to the verge Of present possibilities. He stood upon the heights whence leaps To loftier heights prophetic vision, (The heights that gender popular derision.) In these profoundest moods, When on itself the mind creative broods, He looked like Shelley, or still younger Keats, When rapt, by inspiration inly stirred, With head upturned, on magic seats They hearken for the voice by genius heard; For he, too, was a poet. Verse He wrote not, but that rhythmic sweep of thought He had which comes of feelings wrought By noble sympathies, that nurse The will to lofty deeds, and send The wishes outward where they blend With beauty's magic to create On the broad solid ground Of practice just, compelling very Fate To second his aspiring bound. So rich he was in human feeling, And on his lustrous path he trod With such religious sure reliance Ever to largest principles appealing, That like great Kepler in celestial science, He, too, could think the thoughts of God. Unto the beautiful,âwherein Creative mind is most revealed,â His soul was so akin, That to him were unsealed Secrets of the vast All. Much of its mystery Was opened to him in the fall Of Niagaras, in the tideful sea, In midnight orbs' wise twinkle, In the calm throb of his own pulse, In the auroral lights that sprinkle The night-born dew with glory, In the great thunders that convulse The clouds, in all the heroic traits of Story. Nay, in the common and the little Flashes the beautiful, In grass and grain, in every tittle Of visible, audible nature, in the dull As in the bright. Creative power Is nowhere felt but there upflames the dower Of beauty's life. The microscope Reveals the beautiful in mud, Flaring upon us an immense new hope, For tiniest earthy particle is a bud Of promise. What,âcould its keen focus reach Into the darkest heart,âwhat would it teach? Men, living men, were his rich source Of knowledge; for in them the fineness Outshone, beside the force, Of infinite divineness. His daily comrades were the great Of the big past, men of such weight Their fiery thoughts and deeds Become prolific seeds Planted in the universal mind. The mightiest of men, the Nazarene, The topmost man of all his kind, Whose life was in the clean Inspiring deeps of sympathy, Him he aye studied as an exemplar Of the highest in humanity. Thinking good thoughts, looking afar Beyond the smaller self, The worldly lusts of show and power and pelf, His day lighted by loves, ne'er dimmed by fears, He grew in wisdom with the years, His life one limpid stream of joyous duty, Which filled it full as June with beauty, So full that time brought him no oldness. Spirit ruled him as it ruled Socrates; And so, when on his flesh at last crept coldness, Shone bright before his spiritual eye the keys Of th' Heav'n he had made about him on the earth; And from his body's bier He rose in th' ecstasy of a new birth, His face aglow with beams thrown from th' angelic sphere. REAL. O for a pen whose ropy ink Were purged by piteous tears! So when I come to think Of th' omnipresent ill that sears The tender, sapful, noble human heart, Words may grow tremulous with fellow-pain, But bold to take the part E'en of the lowest, who have lain Wallowing in crime and lust. Can we be loyal to our higher being, Can we be pious, loving, just, Our inward eyes open to seeing What went before and is to come,â Our love and pity will grow deeper, But so with hope enlightened, that the dumb Would speak to us, and smile the very leper. In what a hot-bed of uncleanness, want, And gross publicity, That mother, famished, gaunt, Gives birth to him who is to be A man 'mong other men! The first breath that babe breathes is foul, His cradle is a crowded pen Of blighted manhood, whence a ghoul Would fly, baffled by bloodless pallor, Where unseen devils grin In mockery of human squalor And misery's plaintive din. In such an atmosphere, In a slim stalk so rooted, None of the juices can inhere Of blooming babyhood. The mother's milk that makes his blood With oozy slime is sooted, No blossoms sprout, but only thorns, And these turn tortuous back upon their stem, Poisoning its tardy sap. Upon his morns Nor joy nor sunbeams shine, to sweeten them. Begotten so, so bred, The sportful fairies, whose delight It is to play among the curls Of dimpled childhood's head, Sprinkle upon him tiny pearls Of tears, and saddened take their flight. Missing th' ambrosial endless bath Of feminine tenderness, that hath Quick nurture in it for his craving heart, He languishes and droops. Hardly hath he a childhood in these coops Of deprivation, suffering aye the smart Of pain, he whose whole day should be Joyous as morning's sunlit dew, Painless as a young air-fed tree, Thankful as April's carol new. Nature, with her close lessons, was to him Less than a step-dame. In her lenient lap 'T was not for him to lie: he was a limb Torn from her cruelly, which her sweet sap Could no more animate; for e'en her fount Within him was befouled by rank Bitter and weedy juices. The flood from feeling's sluices Ran inward; he became a tank Secluded, sunless, whence could mount No breathing to the God of Right. Was due his soured maimÃ©d plight To antenatal deprivation. Not guilty was he of self-desecration: His birth-gifts were lesions and losses; Nature herself, she shut him off From Nature; for her boons he had her crosses; A nightmare dim, was life, he could not doff; The goads that pricked him to a guilty tomb She fastened on him in the womb. He was born chained, nor could he wish him free; Growing into false freedom he became A Bedouin of the street; he could not be Forecasting worker; a good name He never could be crowned with; Crime Crouching about him, spread Its pliant net, which Time Tightened about his head. What is manâwhat, societyâ And what is Nature's self, that she Should mock us with such fellows, men Who issue not from homes, but from a den, To prey upon their brothers; for they are Our brothers, seared at birth with sin's black scar, Souls damned ere they have lived their life, Their life a doom of hate and bleeding strife. Why live they, these curst creatures, men who dare No whither look; if inward, they are met With the soul's shudder; if they glare At Heaven, the stars twinkle a threat. Mysterious being sweeps From height to height, from deep to deeps, Higher and deeper ever; And man's upright endeavor Can compass more and more these heights, The more his own deep being Grows master of the mights Wherewith his soul is gifted by the all-seeing. Himself partakes of the creative power: This is his bounteous mighty dower. Such mastery is a token Of manhood, strong to have broken Many a chain that bound him, And with Truth's diadem becrowned him. Within him are the forces that uplift His life to this free altitude. Such freedom is a gift With spiritual sovereignty endued. He is become more than an earthly king, And rules, as Jesus rules, Through indestructible rights which bring Resistless sway, that schools Men's minds through their own light Kindled by the supremest might. In this exalted zeal Angels become his aids, for they Are only men who think and feel More finely, having dropped their clogging clay. When through a self-earned moral sovereignty Many shall have become loyal and free, Then these can free their brothers, 'bolish jails, Silence the multitudinous wails Of vice and crime. But we are all As yet too heedless of the higher call, Too much the slaves of sense and fallacies. We build luxurious jails, and call them palaces; Out of the common self and vain conceits We build theologies that cannot save, Being but rotting steps, showy deceits, That wilder and the more enslave. This self-emancipation is a weary Unceasing battle of the higher Against the lower self, often with dreary Outlook; but God is not a liar, Who gave us reason, hope, and aspiration That they should droop unto prostration. Onward and upward is the rally-cry That ever sounds above the din Of life's tough war, aye, cheering us to die Champions of freedom from sour sin. Deep in the best souls lives a true ideal, And interlinked therewith, as love with duty, Forever glows the consciousness That we ourselves and brother men can bless With daily and supremest beauty, Marrying th' ideal with the real. THE BEAUTIFUL. I. Throughout th' eternal sequences of time Momently is shed by every fiery Sun Of the hot hundred millions safely spun Into immensity by the sublime Almighty Will, the Beautiful, whose clime Is the universal air, across which run Ceaseless creative messages that stun Our thought, straining after words to rhyme With th' unimaginably great. In each Creative thought glows, as its very soul, The Beautiful, which is essence divinest, That colors, shapes and perfumes the vast Whole And every part, e'en to the simple finest, Sparkling wherever thought and feeling reach. THE BEAUTIFUL. II. Beauty's deep office holy is to teach, Through the purification of delight Kindling into clear vision the higher sight. Within a cove, upon a sunny beach, I have seen the mighty Ocean,âwithout breach Of his high privileges, stormful might Laying aside,âcome calmly in, with bright Dear children, round, ruddy, as ripened peach, To toy, gently rolling low-crested billows Into their fearless arms,âlike monarch playing On the floor with his gleeful boys, arraying Himself in love instead of robe and crown,â The waves wooing the little limbs like pillows: A sight the eyes in lustral tears to drown. ROSA. She was a child, and not a child, She looked so blandly wise Out of her large blue eyes. Her gentleness was wild With a quick freedom fawn-like, And freshness that was dawn-like. Docile to all her teaching, Yet from within she seemed to draw The best, and, as she were upreaching For something that she heard or saw, Would silent sit, her head Upturned in visionary mood, As though her tender thoughts were fed By angels with unearthly food. Two romping brothers, who were older, At first would rudely mock her For trances that did hold her Apart. But soon they ceased to shock her With boyish gibings. She By sure degrees became To them a mystery For which they had no taunting name. The father's love almost to awe Was lifted towards his blooming girl, Who with deep tenderness could thaw His colder moods, as she would coy unfurl Before him thoughts so luminously true They soothed with lessons holier than he knew. Lovelier she blossomed with each year, As though creative spirit rained its best Upon her, and would rear A being ablaze with Beauty's sovereign crest, Beauty, sovereign solely through glow Of clean unselfish feeling; And then it is the promise-bended bow A heaven above revealing. Her father and her brothers felt,â And half unconsciously,â This subtle power, that could melt To tenderness the three, And on her bearing throws Its grace, as on the rose A fragrant sap the rose's loveliness. Upon the mother's heartstrings press Close sympathies so deep They her whole nature tune To harmonies that steep Her in a faith that nothing can impugn. Every hour she would fold The daughter to a breast, That almost ached with love it could not hold, Thus easing a sweet fulness that oppressed. Rosa would lie in infinite content, Their beings each in other blent. At noon one day she was not there; Empty at dinner, too, her place. Then they all learnt what a cold air They breathed without her glowing face. And still she came not: then grew pale The mother, restless the two brothers. The father, with a male Paternal strength comforting the lone mother's Quick fears, strode into the small town, The boys following in tears. Soon, loosened from all fears, They were upon her track; For she already had a dear renown For beauty and for kindliness. Ran back The joyful, weeping, elder brother To bring joy to his weeping mother. They found her in a fever-stricken hovel, With soft wet cloths cooling the skin Of two young children. They who grovel In the abjectness of vain self-pampering Would start at that which Cherubin Are holier for witnessing.â Beside them, on another bed of straw, Their mother lay, her features lank With the worn pallor which gaunt fevers gnaw. When Rosa moved to follow, She scarcely had the strength to thank Her gentle nurse. When Rosa kissed her hollow, Wan cheek, she reverently laid Her hand upon the child, and said, âO come, O come again!â Her words thrilling with thankfulness and pain. The body goes, the soul remains. When Rosa passed into the street Her presence still was felt, nor could the pains Resume their wasting heat. A soul-joy planted near a sorrow Works with such healing sympathy That even by to-morrow The grief will no more be. The soul is a creative power: It builds this wondrous fleshly frame, And it can cure the ills that cower Within it, life to lame. Souls are all brothers, and the healthiest Draws from its primal source A deep benignant force, To which the first and wealthiest Of earthly goods is empty chaff Winnowed by wind from wheat, Or as the worldling's laugh Wherewith he would his own soul cheat. Rosa ran on, before her father, brother, To meet her dearest mother. In a gifted girl, outringing Joy in a healthy home, a fervor, Of life is ever bringing Fresh will and strength to nerve her For each return of morning. Sorrow As yet could take no living root, But each day's little grief the morrow Dried off ere it could grow to fruit. Rosa, with all her inward brooding, Was most herself when other eyes Looked into hers. She, excluding None from her love, closely could prize Both old and young, the false and true man: Herself so fully human. Where the rays fell of her warm eyes They made love sprout, in her school-mates Growing so strong, it crushed the lies Of Envy, which abates Rarely its rancor towards the gifted good: Envy feeds on its own infected blood. So alive was she with fellow-feeling, Her ruling impulse was to help The weak, happiest when kneeling By the sick poor; nor was the whelp Of heartless lust beyond the reach Of her capacity to teach. A sympathetic tenderness can waken A hope, a love, in soul the most forsaken. Angelic instincts taught her There is a soul of good in evil things. And now caressing years had brought her A fifteenth May, when life its censer swings With freshest perfumes laden. Never did flowers enrich their bloom With joy of heavenlier maiden; For in and through this glow,â As light upon a landscape's beauty, Transfiguring the outward show,â Shone the pure soul of love and duty, Which, like th' invisible spirit that makes Night's starr'd sublimity, In the beholder's raptured being wakes Feelings of high divinity. Athrough the portals garlanded Of womanhood she gazed With feelings less with sadness sped Than joy; nor was the vista hazed With passion's dim imaginings, Which make the self an ever-shifting centre Of prosperous being. Wings, Gilded by whiter rays, young Fancy lent her, Rays that illume a higher plane Whereon both joy and pain Are tempered by emotion That stills the soul's high yearning, Like cordial piety's devotion Invisible inward incense burning. Beyond the self she could untimely look, Having as child far visions, Wiser than those that from a darkened nook Rule th' aged worldling's confident decisions. Appearances had never flattered Even her untilled youth With misty magnifyings. Truth Enveloped her and shattered The films that cause the false and small to seem The large and true, and make, To most, life a delusive dream, From which on earth they never wake. So, into womanhood she carried Infantile innocence, with its first tender Blossoms, indissolubly married With angel's wisdom to defend her. Her life she could not live amid the shoals And sands whereon life's ocean rolls, And breaks its mightiness in foam. Like the finned travelers of the sea, Her sole congenial home Was in the deeps, of deep humanity. And these she found beside The shoals; for always there are deeps Where is a soul; and where abide Its master-loves, and leaps Its inmost flame, she peered, And met thankful reflection of her feeling, Thankfullest from hearts most seared. Like Pharos high she stood, appealing To passers mid false Fashion's Cold shallows and unfervent passions. None were repelled. Her beauty drew All to her, as the magnet steel, And then, her modest earnestness but few, Nay none, could long withstand, and they would feel Their hearts warm with new love. A jealous matron spoke To Rosa with a sneer would move A worldly girl's quick wrath; it could provoke In her only meek humbleness. âNay, I pretend to naught,â with a deep blush She said, that made her loveliness So whelming, it could crush The matron's jealousy, that she, with look Of mingled love and shame, The dazzling maiden took Into her arms,âwith a self-blame Not known before,âdid press, And with true tenderness caress. Upon her cheek Rosa's tears fell As Heaven's gift of rain In autumn to depleted well. Into that glowing focus, Rosa's brain, Had poured their ripening rays Twenty-one summers; she Felt the high part that woman plays, As yet but half self-consciously. The mastering passion, that unveils Life's beauties, wants, vibrations, deeps,â As morning's glow earth's wonders,âassails The whole strong being to wake from sleeps That hold it passive, she had felt, Not yielded to: she would not break Her nature's wholeness, and she dwelt In motives so impersonal, that, to stake Them on uneven marriage, were To risk her life's success. The man, for whom she might have joyed In love's full rapture, was both fair To look on and to listen to; to bless Life-union too alloyed With self. She lived out of herself, and he For and within himself. Her mate She knew he could not be; She knew, moreover, how to school her. So strong she was and pure, she made the Fate Herself, that seemed to rule her. The heights whereon she lived were heights From lowliness. Into the nights Of bodily and spiritual need She brought beams of th' illumination That had so splendently enfreed Herself. There was accumulation Of wealthiest wealth. All that she owned She would impart; and as her riches Were boundless spiritual treasures, they were loaned Freely as air or promises of witches. In her, life was an ever active love. As whitened Alps the Sun With heavenly heat doth move To pour unstinted streams upon The thankful plains and valleys, The warmth of her large soul Drove her towards unprovided alleys, To allay a ceaseless dole. The freedom she enjoyed, Through soaring powers inborn,â By thoughtful will whetted, upbuoyed,â Inspired her soul with life the thorn Of baffled love, that wounded A tender bosom, to draw out, To hush the petty cries that sounded Through that wide palace, and to rout The whimpering imps who would usurp Its glowing hospitable halls. Thus did great Freedom,âgreater Than passion-swayed Jupiter,â Offspring of spiritual will, The roots of amorous love extirp, With its loud partial calls. Nay more, she could distill, From thwarted feeling, balm That opened wider view, And wrought that spirit-calm Of conquest which doth aye renew With freshened force the sway Of the high self, and makes an atmosphere For longer sight and action's surer way. Thus of herself she grew more fully master, Turning to light whereby to steer What seemed at first disaster. Life deepened round her, and the more she knew The more she found to do. Life deepened, but it darkened not. Seen deeper, life is nowhere dark. In lookers' vision is a spot That swallows up life's hopeful spark, A spot black with the inground grime Of false theologies and crime Ubiquitous. Rosa saw deeper. Deeper she saw, because she felt So deeply, purely. Calm as dreamless sleeper, She saw the basest. Near her dwelt A cruel father of motherless daughters. To them she came to be like a new mother As naturally as waters Their level find. No other Could have so long that door Kept open. Hospitality He knew not, and his core Was so unsocial that, to flee A stranger's face and talk No blandishment could balk. Deeper than blandishment Was Rosa's undesigned attractiveness. In her triumphantly were blent The soul's and body's best address. He even loved to see her enter, And by her tuneful voice And the quick power her soulful manners lent her His rudeness was entranced, as by a choice Adagio is wild leopard's. To his mild orphan girls Her presence was a guardianship, as shepherd's To helpless flock. To sudden whirls Of wrathful ruggedness he was a prey, 'Fore which, as galliots in a squall, His gentle daughters quailed. One day, On provocation small, Or none, he thundered angry speech. Rosa rose quick with features flushed, Spoke warm rebuke at such a breach, And left the chamber. Hushed As funeral group, the stillness broken By sobs, was that sad room. The father paced, pale, no word spoken; The daughters sunk in gloom At the thought, they should not see her more. A slow half hour had gone: the door Opened, and as the day's first light On anxious crew, near rockbound coast, Fighting 'gainst wind and night, Broke on them Rosa's beaming face: almost Shrieked the daughters. Her countenance Alight with spiritual beauty's fire,â As one in heaven-transported trance Listening to angelic quire,â She approached the father, saying, In voice atremble with humility,â As were the soul's choice sparkle through it raying,â âPardon, O pardon me!â Astounded, mute, he gazed; Then humbly turning to his daughters mazed, As he a life-wrong would confess In tones of a strange tenderness, He cried, âForgive! forgive! forgive!â Then noiseless left the room. This is, to live, to live, Inly said Rosa, as she felt the doom Of tyranny was lifted. Their warm tears Of a new joy mingled with hers In close embrace, hers who had plucked the burs That daily pricked their hearts with monstrous fears. Rosa had sweetened a whole family's breath, Had planted life where had been death. Aye, humanly to live Is not, to keep alert The senses with befitting food; Is not, to make the corporal sieve,â Which is but animated dirt,â The end, it being a means to spiritual good; Is not, to flatter passion With wasteful repetition Of its subservient ration, To help hungry ambition Up to its slippery heights, To gather fruit that feeds To plethora the greeds;â But 't is, to work so that the soul Be ever splendent with the lights, The consecrated lights, of love and duty, Illumination that from pole to pole Keeps the earth freshened with unearthly beauty. To arrest a tear before it fall, And make it glisten in a smile, To antidote a sore heart's gall, Efface with truth incipient guile, Divert a threatening hate, And harness it to draw with love, And thus to substitute for Fate A lordlier mandate from above; This is to brighten, vivify Dear life, and lift it human high. FOUNDATIONS. Like the two hands that knead our daily bread, Nature and man should work with even will And watchfulness, when innocent childhood lifts Its helpless palms and prayerful eyes, and prays For love and wisdom in the guardianship Of its young years. Nature is ever wise, Watchful and active as th' unhalting Sun, That warms and keeps alive all earthly being. On man Nature outpours her choicest wealth; He is entrusted to her motherly love; Part of herself, and yet, greater than she, Reflectively creative, he doth rise Out of great Nature, and above her soars; For he hath wings of thought, precursive thought, Wherewith, and manful will, he rules his own And her resources vast. Hale human babe Is a potential deity on earth; Lord of the outward world, if he do grow To be lord of himself. Deep Nature calls On deeper man to mould an infant's powers And inborn potencies, within man's sphere, His boundless sphere, almost omnipotent. Love and high reason are his master-gifts, Empowering him to be like to a God. Teach the loved child to know and love all things,â Earthworms, that so beneficently work Beneath the surface of the teemful soil, Insects that buzz joyously through the air, The bird who pipes a jubilant holiday To tune man's heart into blithe harmony With this all-quickening multitudinous life, The obedient horse and ox that multiply His strength a hundred-fold. Show him the Sun Setting dim dawn ablaze with full-orbed light, Higher and higher in benignant power Mounting to bounteous hot magnificence. Teach him no fear; the rageful hurricane, The thunderclap, let him not dread. Teach him To shrink before rebuke,âeven though it be No louder than the faintest whisper's breath,â That from his deepest sounds with sacred voice. Within his inmost is a deathless spark, Of fire to guide and rule. This is for him The holy of holies. Here, in humble awe, Let him oft hearken: thus hearkening, he Is nearest to th' Almighty. When the stars Look down on him, and he on them, is wrought The chain that binds him to the supreme Mind: These myriad eyes embrace him with their beams. Like diamond, filling its quick heart with light From the far sun, to glow with mingled fire, Man's deep capacity for reverence Swells to religious thought when midnight opes, With shining stellar keys, Infinitude, Deepening the moral beauty of his life. POETRY. It is not in the trees or in the ocean, Nor in the air or earth or spacious skies, Nor in the forms of nature, or the motion Of stream or fawn, not even in the eyes Of woman: in the soul of man it lies, This peerless, heavenly gift, creative power That lights and consecrates all these, and plies For man's uplifting in bright happiest hour This dearest privilege and his divinest dower. CEASELESS CREATION. The smile in the eye Is born but to die. The bud of the rose Full blooms but to fade, The faster it grows The sooner 't is dead. The mother's delight At day-break is born, 'T is dead ere the night Of the next gloomy morn: The father, he strains Through turmoil and strife; Mid bafflings and pains Death swallows his life. Life 's all a dream, Death is a sleep, And joy but a gleam, While trouble we keep. Put out the great light Of faith and of hope,â In the darkness of night You ever will grope; For hope and dear faith Are the sun of the soul: 'T is your blindness that saith All is dark,âlike the mole. The smile in the eye, It never can die; From the soul 't is a flash That in joy will survive The gloom and the crash Of this earthly hive. A soul hath the rose That renews its bright birth: Perennial it blows To sweeten the earth. As star lost in day, The babe hath been won By glory of ray Outshining the sun. The mother's blind eyes Can't see its ascent, As with saddest sighs Her bosom is rent. The babe comes down to her, With kisses doth woo her, With tenderest greeting Whispers heavenly meeting. The father, he meets it (With a new sight he 's blest), In wonderment greets it, From earth-toils at rest. Life 's not a mere dreaming, 'T is rather a beaming From million-fold fire, Each kindled and signed By the infinite Mind, Each aye straining higher. Creative is life, A ceaseless creation, A getting things rife For endless mutation. For change is its law And motion its joyance; Its flow hath no flaw, And it lives upon buoyance. When once 't is in being It never can cease; Delight of th' Allseeing, Eternal its lease. SKETCHES. Between curved eyebrows and her auburn hair A smooth white forehead shone, Like finest Parian glistening in the glare Of genius' handwork, as, all alone In beauty, flash the Paphian's wondrous limbs. The silken eyebrows arch above Soft eyes aglow with love, So warm, their lustre it bedims. A Cupid's bow are her two lips, So sweet, each of the other sips Moisture to make itself the sweeter. In cheek and dimpled chin, small oval ear, Is nothing to defeat her Dazzling, quick-conquering charm. A leer Quailed before all this beauty, which Rounded her neck, then slid Lower, so fresh and rich Itself it quickly hid (Like virtue from a wicked world Or fear before a flag unfurled) 'Neath kerchief, laces and like covers, Delicate provocatives to lovers. But for this hiding, the far-famed Greek Helen's bosom had been shamed. These beauties are beauties, and great; But they are for joyance, not sorrow, For early years, not for the late, For to-day, and not for to-morrow; They are shallow, they cannot be deep, Beauties when you can laugh, not when you weep. They wither too soon and grow cold, And die before they are old. While admiration of a manly nose And eyes cerulean blue, O'erhung by eyebrows lightly brown, Mounts towards climax on th' ivory hue Of forehead with smooth wavy crown, And in its rapture knows Not where to pause,âall features melt In a transfiguring light, Which, like the sacred belt Of halo, quickens blessÃ¨d sight. From deathless inward beauty sprang That belt of holy brightness, Beauty of feelings, thoughts, that rang With echoes from the soul of rightness. Mere outward human beauty is a mask, An empty, perishable cask. Because within his brain are born Powers angelic, given to bloom In spheres higher than this, his earthly morn, Man's compact countenance has the room For supreme beauty, variousness and life. Before a face and head thus nobly bright Joyed admiration rose to fullest height, Beholding great humanity so rife. Th' unconscious holder of such gifts And beauties rapturously gazed Upon the loveliness that blazed Beneath that auburn hair. 'T was not the beauty that uplifts, Fresh as it was and rapturing fair. He looked and passed; for him here was no mate. Corporeal loveliness was not his bait. A life-partner waited his coming, splendid From glow of feminine beauty blended Of purest innocence And rich emotion's reach, with sense So broadly masculine, It lay beneath her feeling's nobleness Like whitest marble of an Apennine, Which Angelo's sure hand is to caress, Beneath the fervent opulence and grace Of flower and foliage on great Italy's fair face. NO END. There is no end: Eternity Seizes each atom, and to be Involves unceasing growth. Mind quickens all: To die were rotting sloth, Hateful impossible impotence. Life tendeth upward, and to fall Is but a seeming, whence Uprise again all things: Mind, their great mother, lendeth wings. Heart-beats cease not within the tomb: The âspiritual bodyâ quits dissolving flesh, And far above a fleshly doom Carries the soul's unceasing throb to fresh And higher planes of being. Life, in its million shapes, Is an incessant fleeing From outworn moulds to new; escapes From matter's bonds, ascending Through infinite degrees, Creating and effacing, rending Material forms with th' ease Of spirit-mastership, Aye razing to rebuild, Through instantaneous power to equip With its deep inwardness all atoms, filled Thereby with an instinctive need Of nursing every seed Planted by overruling Mind. Mysterious Mind lends eyes To all things, even to what seems blind, To comets in the boundless skies, Nor less to molecules that creep Through th' universe, upbuilding it, Mightiest of instruments, that heap Life upon life, and fit Parts to their place in grandest wholes, Obedient to primordial Will. Mind launches thus infinitude of souls, The purposes of being to fulfill, Mind's mighty power and splendor aye attended By thoughts of perfectness, so interblended With mind's own essence, that they glow Twin sovereign lights,âperennial bow Of promise, over all supreme. Immeasurably bright and pure, They waken in all creatures soaring dream, And thereby all forever lure Upward towards better, higher, Inflaming all with quenchless, holy fire. OMNIPRESENCE OF BEAUTY. Beauty is so deep 'tis one with life, And no imaginative knife Can part their threads, close intertwined By primal generative Mind. Nay, Beauty might be called the life of being, Primordial essence bright, Aye, very soul of the all-decreeing, Original, creative, holy Might.â Sea-shells come up from the salt sea, Sprinkling fresh beauty through their eyes, Iridescent interfusedly; With gleam of sea-dipped dyes, And th' infinite grace of varying curves, Refining, soothing tenderest nerves. With what delight of recognition We greet the peeping leaf-buds green, Into life's first fruition Bursting in multitudinous sheen, With unslaked thirstiness Drinking the sweetened air, Reveling in the sun's warm caress, Outgushed so numerous, broad, and fair, They make the forest's grandeur vast. And now they are past, fallen, gone to enrich the roots That nourished them. But Beauty is not past. Instead of leaves, from each tree shoots Radiance, as though the sun Had showered stars among the branches: But for an hour; at noon are none,â Melted by the same might that launches, Even in winter, heated arrows. Lo! In a night Beauty re-assumes His sway, sheeting with snow Each twig and limb: the forest looms, In the calm morning light, A wondrous maze of sparkling white. Again the sap reflows, and floods The earth with leafy green. A twofold beauty is in the woods, A vocal rivaling the seen! Music of a transcendant quire, Cadence unreached by instrument or words, Sweet improvisation, straining higher, In the melodious worshiping of birds At dawn, spontaneous anthem, rich and pure, Mounting to Heaven whence it came, To man's devotion timely overture, Waking religious joy without a name. From rivulet to river, From cataract to dew, From lakelet's shore to ocean's, Great Beauty is the giver Of joyance ever new; Through aspects and through motions, In Nature's colors, forms Of leopard and of fishes, In sunny calms, in storms, In human thoughts and wishes, In lightning's lifeful flashes, In children's silken hair, In eyes and soft eyelashes,â Beauty is everywhere. And man, to be himself, must see it: Chief child of Beauty, he should rise To the height of his high birth: nay, he must be it In feeling thought, if he would prize The grandeur of his opportunities, The splendor of his possibilities. Beauty sparkles over surfaces because It vivifies the core. Inseparable from life, one are their laws: Beauty is the gold in life's ore. The highest we can know Is human life; in man Beauty's great lessons glow Their deepest, in the van Of all corporeal being. His body, what a wonder! Earth's supreme beauty, all o'erseeing, Majestic more than any creature under Heaven's cope; superlatively framed For strength, and spring, and grace, Alone erect, by heat or cold untamed, In his compact, far-looking, listening face Form and expressiveness unmatched. Behind upreaching forehead bold,â As Heaven's best will had been unlatched, And let loose potencies untold,â That mighty product lies, the human brain, The miracle of miracles, the seat Of Mind; Mind which, once growing, never wanes, But action follows its eternal beat. Mind! Through those sun-shaped orbs, the eyes, Lightens this mightiness! Behind in awful silence lies The tool of puissance only less Than high omnipotence,â Puissance of such a might That should it rend its ordained continents Before its glare would pale all light Of suns, and to a whisper sink The tropic thunderburst. But on this fearful brink We stand safe and assured. We are not curst By primal power: we are blest By a divine beneficence, Potent to subject all to law's behest, Wielding 'gainst chaos absolute defense. And this quick instrument of soul, This master-mass of matter superfine, This vivid brain, is only great as whole Through self-subsistent parts that all combine In rhythmical subordination, Its maker, Mind, with the lower organs holding The infinite details of creation, With the highest in its grasp enfolding The largest, deepest, thought and feeling, The grandeur and the reach of Man, His splendent possibilities revealing, Therewith divinist beauty, purpose, plan. The nearer we to spiritual sources, The fuller, subtler, is the unfolding Of Beauty's life. Man with his earthly forces Gets only glimpses bright, beholding, Through deep, inspiring sensibilities, Resplendent tokens, signs, Of what the supreme wisdom is In its beneficent designs. On earth man could easier the sun outstare Than front, unblasted, Beauty's heavenliest glare.</field>
