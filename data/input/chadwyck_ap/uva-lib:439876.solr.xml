      <field name="fulltext">To Clinton Scollard, TRUE POET AND LOYAL FRIEND. âWith reed and lyreâ you wake the echoes sweet That float and linger in the halls of song. I follow after but with lagging feet, And do but stammer while your voice is strong. Post-Laureate Idyls. O why in tripping rhymes relate The legends of our nursery days? Arthurian epics, more sedate, Suit better with our modern ways. THE RAPE OF THE TARTS. ARGUMENT. The Queen of Hearts, She made some tarts All on a summer's day; The Knave of Hearts, He stole those tarts And carried them away! The Queen of Hearts She missed those tarts And griev'd for them full sore; The Knave of Hearts Brought back those tarts, And vow'd he'd steal no more! Isolt, the Cornish Queen, in those dark days When Mark, her unlov'd lord, had brought her back From woodland lodge where Tristram bode with her The space of one revolving moon, but now Was past to Brittany, where the white hands Of one with name like hers, Isolt, had snar'd Him with their gleam, so changeful-hearted he, Fell into bitter musings lasting long, And vexed thereby the sullen Mark, who growl'd His anger from behind his tangled beard, The more resentful that she took no heed. So months went by, until at last there dawn'd A summer morn on wave-washt Cornwall fair And sweet as odorous white lilies are, And sweet indeed to Queen Isolt, who lay With silken broider'd hangings round her bed Facing the morn. Far off the ripple broke Upon the beach unheard, but flasht in air Its silver, and in palace court the birds Of morning sang. Then to herself the Queen: âLo, absent Tristram is not all in all To me, Mark's wife. There yet abides in life Something of worth, tho' Tristram be not here.â The saying pleas'd her, and she turn'd it o'er. âSomething of worth, tho' Tristram be not here.â Then rising from the couch which Mark had left Ere rose the sun from out the Cornish sea, She call'd her waiting maidens to their task, And paus'd before two gowns the damsels brought, As doubtful how she should array herself. One of green samite, o'er which wander'd strings Of gleaming pearls, in mazy pattern set, So that the eye wearied to follow, held Her but such space while one with even breath Might count a dozen; then her glance upon The other fell, a silken robe of blue Shot thro' and thro' with shimmering silver lights. And this her choice at length for that day's wear, Not unforgetful how Sir Tristram lov'd To see her in it; and, when her waiting maids Had rob'd her, slowly mov'd she down the stair, And, after morning hunger stay'd, she past To where the palace cooks and scullions bode, In kitchen vast, whence royal dainties came. All sweetness seem'd her face, and music seem'd Her voice, when she entreated one to bring His cook's white apron for her royal use, And when her maids had clad her in it, none Could think her other than a gracious Queen, Since nothing of her royal grace was hid. So following her fancy's lead, she bade The men about her bring the wheaten meal And all the kitchen tools she glibly nam'd, And place before her on a cross-legg'd stand Of smoke-gloom'd oak; and then her round white arms She plung'd up to the elbows in the meal, Her red lips murm'ring, âIt will serve.â Then, while The cooks and scullions stood with hands on hips And mouths agape to watch, she deftly mov'd About her task, and not with awkwardness, As one unus'd to kitchen toil or cares, But with all grace, such grace as won all hearts, And, ere they knew her purpose, saw before Their eyes row after row of pastry moulds, As shapely as the hands that made, and these The Queen herself in heated oven placed, And, while these brown'd in torrid darkness, sang,â For sweetly could Isolt of Ireland sing: âAy, ay, O ay,âthe winds that fan the fire! Fair tarts in prospect, tarts before me here! Ay, ay, O ay,âand tarts were my desire, And one was not enough, and one was dear: Ay, ay, O ay,âthe winds that move so fast! And one was far, and one tart was nigher, And one will never bake, and one will last. Ay, ay, O ay, the winds that fan the fire!â Far up among the oaken rafters rang Her voice, and clear as is the tinkling fall Of water over rocks that chafe its course, And all within the kitchen felt such stir Within the blood as when the joyous wine Sweet summer music makes along the veins. Then one, to whom she signal'd when the strain Was ended, open threw the oven doors, And drew from warm concealment into light The tarts and bore them to Isolt, who straight Within the cup-like hollow of the tarts One after other placed with golden spoon, On which were graven deep the Cornish arms, The lucent jellies quivering like leaf Of aspen when all else is still, and sound And other motion dead within the wood. This done she bade the cooks have careful charge Of these, her tarts, till she should send, then pastâ Her cook's white apron doftâupward to halls Befitting her fair presence more, and, sleep And summer both at once assailing, slept. Now on the selfsame morning fair Etarre, Awaking with Sir Pelleas's sword across Her throat and Gawain's, felt her fancy turn To him who might have slain her, sleeping, yet Forbore because of former love, and said To him who lay beside her, false Gawain, âGo hence, and see me nevermore!â The Prince, Who deem'd he knew all women's changeful ways, Laught lightly, and essayed to kiss, as oft Before, the warm white hollow of her throat. But she, recoiling, flasht such sudden wrath He, too, drew back, and slowly rose and heard From lips grown stern, from lips his own had prest, The sentence, âGo! and see me never more.â Then he, much marveling on women's ways, Obey'd, and went with slow, reluctant feet Without, and mounted horse, and past across The courtyard and thro' postern portal, past Down garden slopes with musky breathings fill'd, To where the gates, wide open, led to fields And far beyond them forest shades. Thro' these He went and wander'd on to where the walls Of Mark's great palace rose across his view. Then, for the summer noon was hot, he drew His rein beneath a giant oak that made A welcome shadow near the gate, and mus'd Yet more on changeful women's ways till came On vagrant breeze a whiff of pastry thence And woke a sudden hunger in his breast. Meanwhile in hall Isolt of Ireland slept, And slumb'rous summer silence crept o'er all The serving men and maids, till one whose care Had been the tarts to watch, a lad in years But few and wits as scant as years, awak'd From dream unquiet, and awaking, saw The Prince Gawain through kitchen gliding soft, Bearing the great, tart-laden dish. Whereat The lad rose, terror stricken, shrieking loud, âThe tarts.â Again, and like a descant, âGone! The tarts.â Loud shrill'd the cry thro'out the court, And each took up the words till rang from wall To wall the mournful echo: âGone, the tarts!â Fast swell'd the cry and louder with each voice That wail'd the theft until the Queen awak'd And hearing what had happ'd felt her heart sink And visions toothsome of the well-bak'd tarts For royal supper fade to naught, and sat To tears abandon'd and to grief a prey. But false Gawain to saddle leaping, tarts In dish upborne, saw all the rabble rout Of palace kitchen fast behind pursue, And one in saddle follow'd while the rest The shrill cry echo'd, âO, the tarts! the tarts!â Forth from the gates the chase was had until The steed of Prince Gawain stumbl'd and threw Him, bearing still the unspill'd tarts, upon A grassy bank where those who follow'd found And brought him, still tart-laden, to Isolt. Naught said Gawain to temper his disgrace, But let his eye a moment rest upon The Queen, an eye that many maidens lov'd, Then fall demurely on the toothsome tarts. Then she, mov'd somewhat by his grace and glance, That admiration show'd, forgave the theft, And thinking: âLo, a goodly man he seems Since Tristram is not by,â upon him laid But two conditions. First that never should He enter kitchen more in act to steal, And on his knee, down-dropping at her feet, With many oaths the courteous Gawain swore To keep from deeds like this thro' all his life; The next that he should stay and eat with her. So, nothing loth, the Prince of Courtesy stay'd And ate with her the savory, toothsome tarts For all an incense-breathing afternoon, Till one in haste appear'd when sank the sun, Crying, âI crave thy pardon, Queen, thy lord Is near.â Thereat Gawain, warn'd by a look Which ray'd from out her heavy-lidded eyes, Departed with a word of farewell said, And past to his own land, while she prepar'd To meet King Mark returning from the chase. AT THE PALACE OF KING LOT. ARGUMENT. The King was in the parlor, counting out his money: The Queen was in the kitchen, eating bread and honey: The Maid was in the garden, hanging out the clothes: There came a little Blackbird and snipp'd off her nose. Lot, King of Orkney in the Northern seas, Long ere the time when, fighting sword in hand 'Gainst Arthur in the barons' wars he made His name to all true men a byword like A thing of scorn, one summer morning sat Within the presence chamber all alone, For knights and squires that made his island court, (A tiny court rul'd by a weakling king,) Were absent at the hunting every one. Far better had it suited with his mood To ride with them in gay companionship Than to have stay'd behind. But on that day The butcher, baker, chandler, and the host That prosper'd on the waste and riot made At court, their bills had brought and, clam'ring, begg'd Their dues. As one who from his window sees In early morning blue and cloudless skies, And o'er him feels the breezes blowing soft, While in his heart is peace, but later finds The breezes risen to a gale, and dull, Grey clouds fast shutting out the sun and sky And in his bosom discontent is lord; So was it with King Lot when from his chair, After the morning meal which Bellicent, His Queen, had with her maids prepar'd for himâ Since well she knew what meats would please him bestâ He fain had had risen purpose-mov'd to pass Without, but, rising, heard a dismal noise And saw the door burst open while a throng Of angry debtors clos'd him round about. Shrill rang their voices 'mong the rafters high O'erhead, and scarce the King could headway make Against their loud-voic'd clamor, but at length, When they had tir'd themselves with shriekings shrill, He spake again and all attent they heard. âPeace, fools, and leave me time to overlook Your bills. This done, to-morrow at this hour The seneschal shall see that all are paid.â This said, he wav'd his hand, and at the sign The rout of debtors vanish'd all at once And swift, as oftentimes a chatt'ring flock Of sparrows disappears before the sound Of nearing feet, so quickly drew they off, Each man communing with himself, the while Their sharp heels clatter'd on the flinty floor. Then like a wrathful sunshine smil'd King Lot. âI go not to the chase to-day, it seems, But weary hours must spend instead, forsooth, In balancing accounts, since in my court Of figures none knows aught, save I, the King.â At this the sullen Modred, eldest son Of Lot, laught softly to himself,âright glad That any business kept the kingly eye From him, for full of tricks and craft was he, The Artful Dodger of an early day, And often in an uproar set the court. And now the knights and squires had gone without Their King, while he, with anxious face and brow All frown, sat 'mongst his money caskets lost In calculations deep, and murm'ring low Of pounds and shillings, and, at times, of pence, And oft, for better aiming at results, His fingers counting as do boys at schoolâ Like them perplext for want of fingers moreâ So past his morning hours away. Meanwhile Had Bellicent, the Queen, her husband left, And to the kitchen gone to oversee The maids, for such her careful custom was. Right bitter was her tongue when these transgress'd, But to obedience was she all as sweet As winds from off a perfum'd bank of flowers,â And this her maidens knew and strove to please. But on her brow this morn there lurkt a frown, And in her heart reign'd vague unrest, and why She knew not, yet she held her peace and came And went on household quests and would have still'd The gnawing hunger at her heart, and all In vain. At last she to a cupboard bent Her steps, an oaken cupboard built within A niche, and wisely for such purpose made, And open threw its doors. On oaken shelf There gleam'd the glass and silver kept for days Of pomp and show, for Bellicent, the Queen, Had joy in burnisht silver as became Her state, and on her treasure gaz'd she now With proper pride, but on the topmost shelf Her eyes, blue as the seas that circle round Her island realm and dash against its crags, Espied a wheaten loaf, and, close beside, A jar of amber honey, of some hive The luscious spoil. Beholding these the frown From off her brow departed, and, therewith, The gnawing at her heart, and putting forth A slender arm to which a broider'd sleeve, All of red samite, clung in shapely fold, She graspt the jar of amber sweets and next The wheaten loaf, and, all rejoicing, bore Them to a corner window-lit by niche Deep sunk and narrow as the zone that bound Her robe of scarlet samite at the waist. A curtain loosely drawn before kept off Intrusive eyes, and here the Queen retir'd. Upon a ledge beneath the window lay A sharpen'd knife with silvern hilt whereon The cunning artisan had made the dog To chase the boar, and, seizing this, the Queen From off the loaf broad slices cut in haste, And o'er them pour'd the honey from the jar With murmurs of delight half-heard from lips That now in ecstasy essay'd to taste. Then o'er her senses past a drowsy calm As, slowly eating there alone, she grew Forgetful wholly of her lord the King, Forgetful of the honey on her gown, Forgetful of the dinner to be cook'd, Forgetful of the swift-approaching noon, Forgetful of her kitchen and its cares. And this forgetfulness was pleasant to her. Behind the palace, in a courtyard small, Hemm'd in by walls to which the lichen clung In stains of gold and silver laced with black, The moon-faced Edith paced with hasty tread, Bearing the basket with the Monday's wash. Bare to the elbow were her sturdy arms, On which, all red with labor, shone the suds. Low overhead an hempen network fine In intricate confusion mingl'd, cross And bar. Thereon the damsel deftly flung The many motley garments of the court, Diverse of shape and in strange order set, Since here the mended hose of poorest squire Hung neighbor to the night-rail of the King. Glad was the maid to think her work was done, And all her youth broke forth in gladsome songâ The song itself a thing of little wit But humble and accordant with her toilâ âRub, rub, and scrub! the soap is on the shelf! There's many a one much wiser than myself; But not an old man counting o'er his pelf. âRub, rub, and scrub! the soap is here by me! And soap is such to me if not to thee; And whether soap or soda let it be. âRub, scrub and rub! and the slack clothes-line blows: Scrub, rub and scrub, and where is she? who knows? From one wash to another wash she goes.â Loud sang the maid, and all the while behind An angle in the courtyard Modred sat Sullen, and crouch'd with mischief in his heart. Beside him glossy-wing'd, and sharp of beak, A blackbird skulk'd, with evil eye upturn'd To meet the evil eye of Modred bent On him, and one were these in purpose ill. Scarce could the knavish Modred bide the time When he the moon-faced, unsuspicious maid Might harm, and oft the blackbird pertly peer'd Into his face, as one that sayeth âHere Am I,â again, and âMaster, is it time?â At last it chanced that as the damsel mov'd Among the garments that o'erhung the space, And glisten'd in the sun, she turn'd her head A moment toward the angle in the wall All unregardful of the danger there. Full roseate were her cheeks, but redder still Her nose, wherefore, I know not, I but tell The tale, and this, when wicked Modred saw, He aim'd a villain's finger toward, whereat The bird, upstarting, flew with direful speed, And, ere the maid could frame a thought of ill, Had nipt the crimson'd feature with his beak. Sore was the hurt and loud the damsel shriek'd, And wildly from the courtyard ran in haste And pain, but ere she many steps had gone A cord that Modred o'er the path had stretch'd, Catching her feet low fell'd her to the ground. All heavily she sank to earth and lay As one whom fright and pain have overcome At once and stol'n away the strength to move. This saw the Prince, the while he prais'd the bird For faithful service done, and then the twain Departed by a secret way that none But Modred knew. Within the damsel's breast, Whenas she rose and gain'd her feet And naught of bird or other creature saw, Both rage and grief held riot bitter there, But in the heart of Modred joy was lord. SIR EVERGREEN. ARGUMENT. The man in the wilderness asked me How many strawberries grow in the sea; And I answered him as I thought good, As many as red herrings grow in the wood. Sir BEVIS, faithful knight of Arthur's court, Returning from some mission of his lord, Who held him dear, and oft would send by him Such secret message as none else might bear, And who was known to all as form'd of truth And loving service well compact, had found, So late the hour, the gates of Camelot Fast clos'd, and he without was fain to wait Till morning 'neath the roof of one who dwelt Beside the walls by mighty Merlin made; A kinsman whom Sir Bevis dearly lov'd. Glad was the man when he Sir Bevis saw, And heard the knight in courtly accents crave A shelter till the morn, and gladly made His kinsman of the famous Table Round Right welcome to such cheer as he possest. On oaken board he threw the damask cloth, And on it laid the snowy manchet bread, The pasty rich, the lordly round of beef, And from a silver flagon poured the wine. Naught said the knight till, meat and drink consum'd, And hunger past, his tongue was therewith loos'd And with a voice like to the mellow roll Of music deep and full, far heard yet close In seeming to the eager listener's ear, He spoke: âKinsman, thou shouldst have been with me These five days past, which I, at Arthur's hest, Have spent at court of Mark, the Cornish king Who wedded fair Iseult of Ireland. On him all courtesy is lost, but she Is fairer than Queen Guinevere, and false, Alas! as fair, if there be any truth In tales of her and Tristram buzz'd about In Cornish court below us by the sea. Thou shouldst have seen the feastings and the jousts That graced my stay, for greatly Mark desires With Arthur peace and therefore honor'd me On embassage from blameless Arthur sent. For me, I care not greatly for such sports, But thou wast always of another mind And therefore shouldst have gone along with me,â He ceas'd, and resting idly, chin in hand, And elbow propt upon the board, he bent A keenly mirthful gaze upon his host. Then he: âGood Bevis, tell me not of Mark, Of Cornish court, of feasts or lordly jousts, For here, scarce three leagues off from Camelot, Have I adventure had to last my life, Yea, such, I thought, were like to end my life, What time that thou wert feasting with King Mark.â To whom the knight: âThou seemst in goodly trim For one so late in peril of his life; But let me hear.â Thereat while evening wan'd The kinsman of Sir Bevis told his tale. âBut two days since upon a listless morn On which the sun shone fiercely from a sky Of brass, and all the winds were still and husht The murmuring streets of busy Camelot I sought yon forest that, dim miles away, O'erspreads the plain that sloping gently bounds The west. Therein mov'd I as one who needs No friend to 'company his steps, and there, Outworn by distance and by summer's heat, Sank into sleep beside a hollow oak And woke not till what time the evening fell Across the land and feebly strove the pale New moon to wrestle with the dark. Then while I rose bewilder'd, scarce as yet possest Of full remembrance of my journey thence, So dull'd my senses with yet lingering sleep, There sudden brake from covert thick of bush And brier that barr'd the way with thorny front, One mightier than any knight who sits At meat with Arthur at the Table Round. Yea, to my fears he seem'd as huge as ten Though they were each as stout as Lancelot, And fast he gript me by the hair and arm. The field mouse is not in the cat's grim clutch More helpless than was I, thy kinsman, then, And tremblingly I found my voice and spoke: âOh, who art thou who here at close of day Dost hold me fast in peril of my life?â At these my words he loudly laught in scorn And slowly rolling both his gleaming eyes Upon me, gript the closer till I roar'd For pain. Then made he answer rough and harsh As watchdog's howling when the thief is nigh: âThe lord of this great forest, lo, am I! And mighty through its fruits and roots am I. Sir Evergreen am hight, and I can keep Thee here till doomsday, an it pleaseth thee.â To whom then I: âSuch fate would little please; 'Twould please me much the best to be let go.â Amaz'd, he of the wood upon me glar'd The space of one long minute, and the woods Were still. Then broke he into loud-voiced song: âFate! fate! 'tis fate that holds thee pris'ner here; Fate! fate! sharp fate, so think not to get clear. No fate, no fate so terrible as I! Have you not heard my strength no one can beat? Oh, fling yourself in terror at my feet. No fate, no fate so terrible as I!â Full loud he sang the while I quak'd for fear, And thro' the forest loud the grewsome stave Resounded and the forest echoed âI.â Then as I wonder'd what should me befall, Once more he spoke, and, full of dread, I heard. âPoor craven denizen of Camelot, 'Twas not to slay and eat thee that I sought Thee here. Not meet were it for me to eat Thy flesh, seeing I eat not meat, but still On fruits and roots have waxen strong, if wax Be strong and strong be wax.â Then I: âBeeswax They name it in the streets of Camelot.â âPeace, kitchen knave!â loud roar'd Sir Evergreen, âThy prate is like the buzzing of some fly That comes and goes and comes again, and yet For nothing; such thy foolish speech. And now Hear me.â âI cannot choose but hear, good sir; To me thy voice sounds louder than the blast That down great chimneys roars at dead of night.â At this, well-pleas'd, he of the wood relaxt Somewhat his grasp and show'd his teeth in smile; A fierce array, tho' broken here and there. âKnow then, O kitchen knave,â his words to me, âWithin the dusky shadows of this wood Have I these forty summers dwelt.â Then I: âAnd winters too, Sir Evergreen?â To which He answer made: âNot winters two, dull knave, But winters forty as the summers are, Nor have I cold nor rheumatism felt; Yet dwelling thus it well may chance I know But little of the outer world, and thou, Belike, canst tell me what I fain would hear.â He paus'd, as one who, at a loss for words, Doth grope about the chamber of his brain, And from the quest at last returns with those He had not chosen were there room for choice; So far'd it with Sir Evergreen, who roar'd Impatiently his eager question forth: âO kitchen knave, or whatsoe'er thou art, Make answer truly, hast thou seen the sea?â He ceas'd, and in the gloomy wood no sound Was there save faintest stir above our heads Of half-awakened nestlings in the nest. Then meekly question'd I: âThe A, B, C?â âNot so, O knave, the sea I mean doth wind About the world, as once in youth I heard Sage Merlin speak, like snake about its prey. Once more I ask it, hast thou seen the sea?â âFull oft, in winter storm and summer calm, Sir Evergreen,â I answered, chill with fear. â'Tis well,â he roar'd, and more beside had said But that I spoke again and all in wrath He heard. âStrong sir, it is not well if thou Dost speak thus of the sea, for well and sea Are vastly different things, tho' water lies In both.â I ended; scarce my words were done When all the temper of the man broke forth; Mighty his wrath and gustily he spoke: âWell me no wells or 'twill be ill with thee; Sea me no seas, for I will seize on thee; Lie me no lies or soon wilt thou lie there.â Thereat he dragg'd me past the hollow oak And fiercely pointed to a torrent deep That many feet below us leapt and ran 'Mong sharp and ragged rocks that vext its course, And made as he would hurl me thitherward. More had he said, and op'd his mouth to speak And op'ning, chok'd, (a frog, it may be, fill'd His angry throat,) but later spoke more calm: âO knave, provoke me not, lest ill befall, And now once more attend. There grow within This wood, beneath the leaves and creeping near The ground, red berries which the seeming wise Call straw. Full sweet and toothsome to the taste Are they, and on them have I often din'd Nigh to that hour in which the golden sun In high mid-heaven stands, and all about The leaves hang quiet in the summer's heat,â My one regret that there were all too few To satisfy the hunger in my breast. Now, kitchen knave, if haply thou canst tell How many of these berries rare within The sea do grow, it may be I can feed Thereon when these within the woods are gone.â He ended here, and on me bent his gaze With all expectancy, as one who sits Within a dry and thirsty land, and sees The storm-clouds gather in the far southwest. He pausing, I kept silence for a space; Then, as the shadows darken'd in the wood, And owls from out the hollow oak flew forth With baleful shriek to meet the coming night, Made answer to the question as I deem'd It best. âThe sea is wide, Sir Evergreen, And hard were it for any man to count And number rightly all that is therein, Yet near enow for purpose practical It chanceth I may answer to thy quest. Of berries toothsome, which the wise call straw, (Though not a straw care I for what they say, Not ev'n the straw which breaks the camel's back, Nor that which shows the changeful current's course,) There grow within the angry-bosom'd sea As many as of herrings red are found In green and dusky confines of the wood.â Thus I, and he before me listen'd all Attent as child who, by some fireside warm, On winter evenings ere the hour for bed Heark'neth, delighted, to some fairy tale, But keepeth silent lest a word be lost; So all in hope heard he, but at the last Grew sad and loos'd his grasp, yet gaz'd Upon me sternly that I dar'd not stir For fear. Then, while I wonder'd at him, gave A cry whose tingling echoes reach'd the stars: âO knave! I know not what red herrings be!â Full bitterly he cried, and, turning, past Adown the forest, and the forest clos'd Upon him, and uncheck'd I went my way.â âA grewsome tale,â the bold Sir Bevis said When all was ended and the story told, And then the twain to slumber past, and dreams. THOMAS AND VIVIEN. ARGUMENT. Tom, Tom, the piper's son, Stole a pig and away he ran. The pig was eat, and Tom was beat And Tom went crying down the street. Thomas the young, Thomas the mischievous, Thomas the dark-brow'd lad of Camelot, After a day of mirth and reveling At court, in which, tho' oft rebuk'd, his voice Had ever mingl'd, louder than the rest, And shriller than the storm-drave seabird's cry, None within a triple-window'd room That in his father's dwelling faced the east, Upon his bed, ere sleep her wings had wav'd Above him, lay and meditated much In what new mischief he should next engage; Then, ere conclusion harmful could be reach'd, Slipt into sleep, and dreaming, past to fields Where youth and mischief held high holiday. Sole son was he of old Sir Guy; a man Of stature humble, but of wisdom great, Who now was counted of the Table Round, But in his youth, as some could still recall, Ere from the land of Cameliard he came, The sometime piper to its lord and King Leodogran, 'gainst whom the heathen warr'd; But after, when the peerless Guinevere, The daughter of Leodogran, had been By holy Dubric to King Arthur wed, Had past to Camelot; and there by dint Of faithful service in a humble place, But more because the King the fire of truth And nobleness perceiv'd in him and lov'd Him for it, was now made knight, and brightly shone In burnisht armor at King Arthur's court. With him the King had counsel many times, For knowledge deep of men and things Sir Guy Possest, and year my year his wisdom grew The riper as his head grew white. But since To no man living perfect wisdom comes It hapt therefore, that in one thing, not small, Sir Guy, the sage was wanting, and the King To him had that day put a question hard. âHow chances it, Sir Guy,â had Arthur said, âThat thou whom all men reverently call The wisest of our court, now Merlin lies A pris'ner in the wood of Broceliande, Hast fail'd, or so it seemeth to our eyes, To rule and govern well thine only son?â He ceas'd and then, from out a passage close Beside, a woman came and stood before And cried: âO King, who never yet wouldst see And willingly, injustice done to aught, Hearken to me. But now my son, in years Scarce ten and slender as a flower, was set Upon and beaten by a lad, the son, It hap'neth, of thy wisest knight, Sir Guy, And therefore may it please thee, noble King, To see that this young Thomas, for so him They call, be dealt with sternly, as is sure His due.â She spoke in haste, not seeing him Who stood beside the king, and courteously Made Arthur answer to her, and she went From out the kingly presence glad of heart. When the last echo of her steps had ceas'd, The King again to his companion turn'd Repeating in the glances of his eyes The question that before was ask'd with lips. Stroking his chin in thought, Sir Guy abode In silence for a space, then, sudden, flasht A face of mirthful radiance on the King, And begg'd his lord would listen to a tale. âFull willingly, Sir Guy,â replied the King, And smooth'd the gilded dragon on his robe. âA peasant in the land of Cameliard,â Began Sir Guy, âa slender living won By keeping ducks and geese, and round his hut Their constant screams and quackings harshly rang From earliest hours,âsweet music to his ears. One spring it chanced that from the nest two geese Came off at once leading their callow young. One mother proudly walk'd in front of ten Yellow as gold, and all submissively They follow'd where she led, nor seem'd to dream Of will apart from hers. The other goose Was mother of but one, and this one black And wayward, such as never had been seen. In vain the mother strove obedience From this to gain; and oft her comrades shook Their heads, foreboding ills that lay in wait For errant goslings that obey'd no law. At last the mother strove no more but left Her single gosling to its own wild will: But when a year had gone the peasant saw No finer bird amongst his flock than this Of which such dire prediction had been made. But she that led abroad her brood of ten Ere summer ended saw them fall a prey To enemies that lurkt in grass and pool, And one by one they slowly disappear'd Till autumn came and found her desolate.â âA clever tale,â here spoke the King, and smil'd âBut all things are not rul'd by accident, Sir Guy, and seldom from the thorns do men Attempt the purple-cluster'd grape to pluck, And this Sir Guy, the wise, should know as well, Or better, even, than the King himself.â Then, rising, Arthur past with thoughtful step Unto the bower of Guinevere, his Queen. Thomas the young, Thomas the mischievous, Awak'ning on the morrow from his sleep, Beheld from out the windows of his room A sight that fill'd his bosom with delight, For while as down the narrow street he glanced, A well-fed sow, attended by the train Of youthful swine that made her litter small, With grunts of deep content slow rang'd along. A moment only gaz'd the lad, then stole With soundless steps down the long stair, and peer'd Into the street without. In narrow lines Thro' rifts between high houses shone the sun And lay in golden bars across the street. A soft breeze lifted banners from the walls And tost them lightly in the air. Scarce had The city wak'd, and only here and there An early-risen scullion, rubbing eyes In which the sleep yet linger'd, went his way To morning task. The lagging steps of these And noise of swine the only sounds that stirr'd The silence of the town. All cautiously The lad with careful feet, on mischief bent Crept toward the trustful, unsuspicious swine, But, as his shadow fell across a bar Of gold, the mother felt the danger near, And, shrieking, fled, with all her litter'd tribe At heels. But one, the smallest, tenderest Of all, because less swift of foot than all The rest, the ruthless Thomas seiz'd and bore Triumphant to his friend, the palace cook, The twain intending later on the pig To dine. Ill reckon'd they, the knavish pair, For wily Vivien thro' her lattice saw The theft, and so, because she lov'd to tell A tale, and more because the lad had been Full oft a torment to her, later went And told King Arthur what the son of Guy Had done. The blameless King when he her tale In silence heard, not doubting that for once She spoke the truth, bade some one call Sir Guy And Tom, and summon likewise all the court. When this was done the King upon Sir Guy Bent brows of sudden wrath and said: âThy one Black gosling,â O Sir Guy, in growing up To be the chiefest goose, or what thou wilt, Of all his time, is like, I fear me much, To prove a very fruitful source of ill Among the youth of tender age at court.â To this in humbleness Sir Guy replied: âIt may be as thou sayest; therefore do Unto him as thou wilt.â Then call'd the King. Sir Kay, the seneschal, and gave command That at the stroke of noon Sir Kay should lay On thieving Thomas full twelve stripes with rod Of season'd birch; and hearing this, a smile Of joy ran round the court, and no one rais'd A voice of pity, for none pitied him. Then as Sir Kay the luckless Thomas led From out the presence of the court and King, The wily Vivien past to where the cooks And scullions bode and singling out the one She knew to be the friend of Thomas, drew From him with all her wondrous woman's art The after hist'ry of the stolen pig. Won by the damsel's smile, before he knew, The cook, a simple knave and all unus'd To arts like these of Vivien's, promise gave That he at noon the roasted pig would place Upon the table in her private bower, For on such fare full well she lov'd to dine. The promise made again she smil'd and seem'd As innocently fair as Enid, wife To Prince Geraint, and, dazzl'd by such grace To him, a kitchen servingman, he stood With floury hands on hips and open mouth, And wide eyes staring as she past without. Thomas the young, Thomas the mischievous, With dark anticipation watcht the sun As rapidly it clomb the morning sky, And much too short the time till from the tow'rs Was clasht the hour of noon, but to the maid The hours paced slow, and oft she sigh'd for noon Impatiently exclaiming to herself That never had been known a morn so long. But when, on platter hot, the cook the pig Brought in, her humor chang'd and thereupon Grew all as sweet as breath of flowers in June. Low bow'd the man as she within his palm A gold'n token slipt from fingers white, The while he heard her voice his cooking praise, And felt the magic of her presence near And vainly wish'd himself of her degree; For breath of scandal soiling Vivien's name Had not so far as palace kitchen blown, And therefore deem'd he still the damsel pure. Long linger'd she o'er this her fav'rite dish, And none the less 'twas sweet to her who knew That high above the tumult of the streets Below, in direful anguish, rang the shrieks Of Tom. THE VISION OF SIR LAMORACKE. ARGUMENT. As I was going to Saint Ives I met seven wives. Every wife had seven sacks; Every sack had seven cats; Every cat had seven kits; Kits, cats, sacks and wives, How many were going to Saint Ives? King PELLINORE of Wales, the same who slew Lot, King of Orkney in the Northern seas, Three stalwart sons in wedlock lawful had. Sir Lamoracke de Galis eldest was Of these, the next Sir Aglavale, the third The pure Sir Percivale, and these were knights Of Table Round, and with them Tor, the child Of shame but brother to the three no less, And first created knight of Table Round The Table of the great Pendragonship. Sir Lamoracke among King Arthur's knights Was bravest save for three, but since the three Were Lancelot, Tristram and Geraint, no less Of honor deem'd it reck'ning fourth with these. In the mid-strength and hardihood of youth He was when vision by his sister seen, A holy nun much worn by fastings long, Sent half the court in quest of Holy Grail; And Lamoracke went, as eager as the rest, And all for holy longing underwent Long toilsome days, and nights as wearisome, And piteous perils manifold he knew, Until, a twelvemonth past, he set his face Again toward Camelot with yet no glimpse Of what he sought, and sorrow in his heart. One morning chanced it that while pacing slow With head bent down and gaze upon the ground On homeward way thro' forest deep that stretched From Camelot southward many leagues, there crost His path a ten-tin'd stag, and after rode A knight he knew to be Sir Sagramour, In fierce pursuit, who, seeing in the wood A horseless knight all travel-worn and sad, Left flying deer to its wild will and leapt From his own horse and begg'd Sir Lamoracke Ride in his place as being one of those Who went in search of Holy Grail. Thus said The sweet Sir Sagramour and added thence: âThy face, Sir Lamoracke, is not unknown To me.â Then slowly Lamoracke answer'd him: âO all for naught my quest and not for one Like me the vision glorious, but thou, Methinks, for knightly courtesy the peer Of any at the court, might well have seen What I, the son of Pellinore, have not.â âNot I,â then spoke the sweet Sir Sagramour, âBeing ensnar'd with earthly things unto My hurt, but an' I pray you, Lamoracke, ride. My castle scarce a half league distant stands, There mayst thou rest, at least until the morn, And ride to court equipt as knight should be So far as my poor store shall serve thy turn.â Then Lamoracke lookt up and answer'd him, âAh, sweet Sir Sagramour, none other suit Suits with my sadden'd fortunes like to this Which now I wear and therefore in array Like this must I before King Arthur pass Once more.â Then answer made Sir Sagramour: âThou knowest best, but still I pray you ride Homeward with me and eat and rest a night; Else thou wilt never live to see thy lord At all, in this or any other garb.â Full gentle was the manner of the man, And Lamoracke for utter weariness Gave way and past with sweet Sir Sagramour Unto the other's castle near at hand, Yet thinking, âon the morrow I will go.â As one who following the chase for days Scarce heeds his wearied limbs because so full Of eager haste but home returning finds Each step a pain and life a mockery, So now with Lamoracke, who, with the fire Of zeal and holy purpose quite burnt out, Tarried for days with sweet Sir Sagramour, Too weak for further travel and heart-sick Withal because of failure in the Quest. To him in those dark days came Sagramour And whisper'd, âCourage; failure is not crime.â And after came the wife of Sagramour Beseeching him to be of cheer, to whom He heark'n'd listlessly. Then came a child The son of these, a three-years winsome lad Who stammer'd âCourageâ as he had been taught, And seeing that Sir Lamoracke took no heed Stammer'd his lesson o'er again, whereat The knight, half rising on his elbow, turn'd And saw the boy with parted lips, and cheeks All satin soft, and hair and eyes the hue Of sable pansies, staring full at him; Then Lamoracke rose and caught the lad in arms And kiss'd him oft and spoke full tenderly: âThou bidd'st me be of courage, little one? Yea, for thy sake I will,â and from that time Shook off, as far as might be, sad regret. Yet still strength linger'd on its way to him, And with these a sennight longer bode, And after rose refresh'd and went his way. But ere that time he told to please his host Full many a tale of what had hapt to him In Quest of Holy Grail and once the tale Ran like to this. âOne morning after dreams,â So said Sir Lamoracke, âof Holy Grail Seen by me who unworthy am to see With waking eyes, I past, for then was I In Cornwall by the sea, along a road That wound past splinter'd crag and shallow cove To fishing village of Saint Ives. Seaward Saint Michael's Mount rose like a vision fair All roseate with dawn and softly broke Against its base the Cornish sea. A light Breeze blew that gently stirr'd the leaves and then Rested content while overhead a flock Of birds shrill'd one to other, flying south The sound clear falling thro' the morning air. The weather-beaten fishers mended nets Sitting on boats updrawn beside the sea And hail'd me with âgood-morrowâ as I past, In simple fisher wise. Suddenly round An angle in the path before me came Full seven fisher-wives bending beneath A heavy burden each one bore in sack Of dusty leather on her shoulders old. Small trace had these of brow may-blossom, cheek Of apple blossom or the eye of hawk, And clumsily the wrinkl'd nose of each, Tip-tilted, like a thirsty duckling's bill After much guzzling in the pool, did seem To point the way. A wailing clamor rose In air and louder grew as nearer came The seven, halting where I stood aside To let them pass, and lowering their sacks Upon the ground. In much amaze I ask'd The seven what their burden was, whereat The nearest shrilly pip'd forth: âCats, sir knight, To rid the palace of King Mark of rats That fright the fair Iseult, his Queen.â At this Each wrinkl'd dame her knotted sack-string loost And forth from out the seven sacks there stalk'd With pace sedate, and slowly waving tails, And deep-ton'd purrings of well-fed content, Full seven times seven cats and every one The mother proud of seven kittens small That sprawl'd and mew'd beside the sacks. Such sight I never saw in Camelot, altho' Our Camelot is vaster than Saint Ives And cats enow contains, as one may deem Who finds his slumber broken by their wails On roof and tow'r from midnight till the dawn, And long I star'd at sprawling kits, and cats, And sacks, and wives, until within the sacks The seven wives replaced the cats and kits And journey'd forward, wives, and sacks, and cats, And kits, while I with musings curious Past onward to Saint Ives.â âA sight indeed,â Here spoke Sir Sagramour, âand speedily The burden of the seven wives should clear The Cornish castle of its brood of rats Save one, its churlish lord, for fouler rat Than Mark, the craven, lives not upon earth.â To whom Sir Lamoracke: âTrue, Sir Sagramour, But tell me of thy wit, which passes mine, How many, reck'nest thou, to fair Saint Ives Were going on that morning, kits, and cats, And sacks, and wives.â So sweet Sir Sagramour Knit brows, and tighten'd lips, and fingers told The space of three long hours till fell the sun And creeping darkness came upon the land, And still no nearer was he to result Than he had been at first when Lamoracke put The question, nor with morning was it clear, And with the morning Lamoracke went his way. THE RETURN FROM THE QUEST. ARGUMENT. Hark! hark! The dogs do bark; Beggars are coming to town. Some in rags, And some in tags, And some in velvet gown. The summer brooded and the winds were husht, And on the palace walls the sunshine slept, And all within King Arthur's court withdrew To where the shadows deepest lay, and thought Of winter and the snow. But he, the King, Sitting beside a window that o'erhung The stream that murmur'd past the lichen'd walls And wander'd thro' the meadows to the sea, Mus'd on the time when of the Table Round The number was complete and of his knights Not one was absent from his place. But now The seat of many a one in Arthur's hall Was vacant, and from off the walls was gone Full many a blazon'd, burnisht, knightly shield. This had not been, so sadly Arthur mus'd, But for the apparition of the Grail Seen in a vision by that holy maid, The sister of Sir Percivale, who told The wondrous tale to all his brother knights, And straightway set them longing for the Quest. Then, while he mus'd, the voice of Dagonet, The fool, shrill'd thro' the silence, and the King Lookt up. Before him stood the fool, who call'd, âArouse, my brother fool, and hark to me!â Then answer'd Arthur, nothing loth to break A jest or two with little Dagonet, âBut why thy brother fool am I?â To whom The jester, shaking all his bells, replied, âWhat sayest thou of him who constant wears A thistle next his heart and knows not whence His pain? Who fain would make a shining crown From lumps of lead? And such a fool art thou. And therefore shouldst thou wear a cap and bells, And therefore have I call'd thee brother fool.â Then thus the King: âA bitter, pointless jest; Thy wit doth not increase as doth thy age.â To whom, in answer, shrill'd Sir Dagonet: âSaid I not truly? Take my cap and bells;â Then mutter'd, past the hearing of his lord, âThe thistle next his heart is Guinevere, His Queen,â and after, spoke aloud, âThy knights, My brother fool, are not they all dull lumps Of lead? And after all thy pains are spent Upon them leaden still they yet remain. Of such as these thou vainly hop'st to make A shining crown of manhood in thy realm, And therefore have I call'd thee âbrother fool.ââ âThy wit is sharply edged, my fool,â here spoke The King, âand yet, for all its sharpness, fails.â Thereat the dwarf peer'd curiously up Into his master's face, and seeing naught Unusual in its kingly grace, had turn'd, But turning, caught the echo of a sigh, And knew his arrow reach'd King Arthur's heart. Thereafter fell a silence on the twain And Arthur mus'd as sadly as before On hopes that had been his in long-past days When he had plann'd the healing of the world. Slow past a morning hour until at last A momentary vagrant breeze, that thro' The high, unlatticed, open window swept, Tost aimlessly an early wither'd leaf Into the kingly lap. Then spoke the King, Smoothing the faded leaf: âSir Dagonet, It may be that thy song is gentler than Thy wit; if so be, let me hear.â Whereat The dwarf, moving to where a gilded harp Half hidden in a corner of the room Gleam'd like a star in mellow darkness set, Sudden swept all its strings impatiently, And when the gust of music sank and died And rose again to live in wailing, sang,â And sad and bitter were the tune and words. âHigh hopesâhigh deedsâwe hope but while we may; The buds have blown, their perfume is no more; The time is sped, the glory past away; New time, new strife,âthe hours of joy are o'er; New strife, new hate, to fit this later day; New hates are deep as those that were before; High hopesâhigh deedsâwe hope but while we may.â The singer ended, and his bitter notes Were follow'd by the snapping of a string. Then said the King: âYe do the harp a wrong, To make it sponsor for your grewsome stave, And kinder had it been to chant a strain More pleasing unto weary ears like mine.â To whom then sadly spake Sir Dagonet: âNo lightsome lays are left to sing; the hours Of joy are o'er;â and while the King his words Revolv'd in mind and echo found therein, The dwarf obeisance made and danced away. âHigh hopesâhigh deedsâwe hope but while we may,â The King said slowly to himself, and paus'd, For sudden rose a clamor in the streets, As if the countless dogs of Camelot Were all one voice, such uproar was there made. Then Arthur, wond'ring at the din, arose And past to an apartment that o'erlookt The city's streets, and peering forth, he saw A train of weary pilgrims near the city walls. Then open swung the weirdly sculptur'd gates, And Arthur knew the men, his knights return'd From Quest of Holy Grail. And first rode Bors And Lancelot. Dim were the trappings once So gay on men and steeds, and tatter'd shreds Now wav'd and flutter'd from their garments' hems. Behind rode Percivale, in dusty rags, And after, others worn and torn as he, And beggars never seem'd so poor as these, The crest and flower of Arthur's Table Round; But last of all Gawain in velvet fine Flasht gayly by with knightly comrades twain, For pleasant was the Quest for him who made So sure the holy Quest was not for him, And thus King Arthur saw his knights return From Quest a twelvemonth long of Holy Grail. Loud rose the canine clamor in the streets As these rode by, a beggar throng to eyes Which saw them pass beyond the city walls The year before, impelled by holy zeal, And he who now shone brightest, false Gawain, In honor's ranks the faintest of them all, But shriller rang the voice of Dagonet Dancing beside the train, who, as he saw The kingly face regarding all who past, With slender finger pointed to the knights Return'd as beggars from their bootless Quest, And sang, and bitter both the notes and words,â âHigh hopesâhigh deedsâwe hope but while we may.â THE MAID'S ALARM. ARGUMENT. Little Miss Muffet Sat on a tuffet, Eating of curds and whey. There came a black spider, Which sat down beside her, And frightened Miss Muffet away. Queen GUINEVERE at Almesbury abode Unknown, after her shameful flight from court, And there the long days came and went, and found And left her thrall to grief. One little maid Companion'd her, a novice in that house, To whom the Queen in lighter hours of griefâ For sorrow weighs not always equally, Else there were none could bearâgave listless heed. As one through blinding mists of care and dole Might half discern a kitten at its play, And smile, scarce comprehending why, so she, The Queen, unto the novice's prattle turn'd Half ear, dulling, it may be, thus the edge Of grief, for low the maiden's voice and sweet. âSir Feumbras my father was,â so said The maid, âa knight of Arthur's Table Round, A goodly man, much favor'd of his King. To him King Arthur gave to wife the fair Jehanne of Camelot, and I was born Of these who in the selfsame summer died, A lustrum since.â Low to herself the Queen, âI knew them both, a simple, happy pair, Who lov'd each other and who knew no sin.â Then spoke again the maid: âThereafter liv'd I with the kinsfolk of my name until A twelvemonth back I came to Almesbury. But oft I sigh for Camelot and think In dreams I hear my father call my name, The name himself would give me when I pleas'd Him well, for yet I had another name.â âYea, and what was it?â said the sad-ey'd Queen. To whom the novice answer'd, âGuinevere, The name that's borne at court by Arthur's Queen.â âA luckless name,â the Queen made answer here, âA name that carries with it shame and tears.â âAnd think you thus?â in awe the novice said, âYet so it seems these latter days, if words They say of Arthur's Queen indeed be true. Perchance my father fear'd it when he call'd Me Muffet in its stead. Would I might hear Him call me Muffet now,ââand here the maid Her sentence broke in air and mus'd a space, And silence fell upon the twain, and roll'd Far off the thunder while a summer storm Drew quickly on. Then guilty Guinevere Past into sadder musings than the maid's, And nearer crept the storm and darker grew The cell wherein they sat. But she, the Queen, Deep wrapt in bitter thoughts, knew not of this, But felt at last a pulling at her gown, And, rousing, saw no form, but heard a cry,â âThe storm! the storm.â Then came a deaf'ning sound, As if the tow'rs of all the world were thrown To earth, and in the yellow, quiv'ring flame She saw the novice's frighten'd face and gleam Of holy symbols on the wall. Close clung The maid, and when the storm grew one fierce roar, And darting flame one baleful yellow glare, Shudd'ring, the novice hid an awestruck face Within the folds of samite black that clothed The Queen. Then Guinevere the elder threw One arm about the younger Guinevere, And waited for the ceasing of the storm. Guilt shielding tender Innocence,âthus ran The bitter thought of Arthur's sinful wife. So past an hour, until, its passion spent, The storm rush'd angrily to other lands, And drew with it the roar and gloom and glare; And after, through the casement, came a shaft Of yellow sungleam, that in sport did seem To move and flicker o'er the rush-spread floor. Thereat the little novice rais'd her head From out the sable samite folds, and fell Again to harmless prattle of herself And of her simple life before she came To Almesbury. âFew mates I had, nor car'd,â So went the tale, âand happier was I To sit at home and list to tales of arms Told by my father and his brother knights Than roam the city streets unthrift of joy. And when my mother prais'd my daily task If done as she would have it, would she place Upon the board before me curds and whey With snowy manchet bread for well she knew What fare of all I deem'd the best. And once I sat beneath a hanging vine, that made A cool, green shadow at the farther end Of the long garden at my father's house. Over me sang the joyous birds full sweet, And close beside uprose a lofty wall, On which the golden moss and lichen slept. A curious, carven, wooden bowl I held, Fill'd almost to its brim with curds and whey, And on the crimson-tufted tuffet where I sat, with space enow for two, a loaf Of toothsome manchet lay. No single care Had I, the contents of the carven bowl The limit of my childish wants; but ere The spoon to lip was lifted, all the song Above my head was husht and silence crept Athwart the golden afternoon. Then I, With boding fear, turn'd to the lichen'd wall And on its surface saw a hideous blot With moving legs, and horny claws, and eyes Quick darting. Scarce my father's blazon'd shield Might hide the creature's bulk, for surely saw I never yet a spider huge as this Which from the wall at last, down-dropping, came And on the crimson-tufted tuffet sat, And sitting, turn'd its baleful glance on me. A moment only stay'd I there in fear, And then the horror of it on me grew Until I fled in haste, the carven bowl Rolling before me, and the garden walk Whit'ning with streaming curds and whey. And when I told the tale indoors, Sir Feumbras, My father, shook his head and fear'd lest this Might be an omen of dread thing to be, And went at last to Merlin with the tale, Whom all men counted wisest of the time.â With mention of the wizard's name, the Queen, Who had half heard, not wholly lost, the tale, Rous'd to the full ear as she ask'd, âWhat said The sage?â âBut little we might understand,â Replied the maid, âfor dark his meaning was, And faint his words behind his winter beard, But mostly seem'd it like to this: âAgain In years to come a shape beside the child Shall sit; not black, like this, but fair to look Upon, and safer were she by the first With bowl of curds and whey.â Thus Merlin spake, But I,âI know not all he meant.â Thereat The Queen looked hard upon the maid, in doubt If she were simple-seeming as her words; And while she gazed her face grew stern and dark, The sunshine drew itself from off the floor, The wind swept sobbing thro' a door ajar, And, in a sudden horror, from the room The maid fled shuddering! THE WATER CARRIERS. ARGUMENT. Jack and Gill went up the hill To draw a pail of water. Jack fell down and broke his crown And Gill came tumbling after. âSo all day long the noise of battle roll'd Among the mountains by the winter sea,â But young Lavaine, the knight of Astolat, And brother to the lily maid who died For Lancelot's love, was reckon'd not of those Who âfell in Lyonnesse about their Lord,â King Arthur, whom the three Queens bore away. For he, Lavaine, who lov'd Sir Lancelot But reverenced his King and conscience more, Had hasten'd to the standard of his King When evil-hearted Modred rais'd revolt, And Lancelot, the faithless, stain'd, alas! His manhood, warring 'gainst his friend and King. And so, because the lad was true and brave, And modest seeming, nor was rash of speech, Had Arthur made him of the Table Round And lov'd to have him near. Whereat Lavaine Greatly rejoic'd and gladly would have died To serve in any wise the blameless King. But when the sun came from the under world And shone upon that field of battle near The winter sea, Lavaine by Arthur's side Receiv'd a vengeful thrust aim'd at the King, And from his horse, slow reeling, fell, and o'er Him swept the host; but bluff Sir Torre, who saw His brother fall, came spurring hence and dragg'd Him to one side, and there, in knightly wise, Gave him such tendance as his wit devis'd, And left him, guarded by a humble squire, But thinking, âIf I live, I will return;â And scarce an hour was gone before a stroke From one of Modred's men had cleft Sir Torre From brain to nape. So died he for his Lord. But of his tendance or his death Lavaine Knew naught, but lay in stupor deep as death, And to the eye that watch'd he seem'd as dead. Whereat the humble squire mus'd to himself: âIf he be dead, he needs not me to guard; And if he be alive his foes will think Him dead, and truly I do deem him dead, Yet be he dead or living I must see The issue of the fight,â and saying went And saw, and, seeing, met the death which might Have spar'd him by the side of Sir Lavaine. âSo all day long the noise of battle roll'd,â Yet Sir Lavaine in stupor lay upon The field until the sun went down, and shone The moon at full upon his armor clasps And glinted on the chasing of his sword. As one who journeying in lands remote Returning takes by slow degrees the old Life up, so Sir Lavaine return'd from death Or what had seem'd like death, not all at once But dimly had a knowledge of his state And what had past, and then, because too weak To think, he fell in sleep again and wak'd Not till the sun brake from the underworld, And near him, having watch'd the barge that bore King Arthur out of sight, there slowly drew The bold Sir Bedivere. These two last left Alive upon the field. The mournful twain At length slow moving from the field, because Lavaine was weak from hunger and the wound, Past on to where within a little wood A simple hermit liv'd a blameless life. With him the pair abode until Lavaine Was heal'd and then the bold Sir Bedivere Past to his own land, distant Cameliard, And then, a little later, past Lavaine To his. Small joy was now at Astolat For him, the last of all his race, and night And day he seem'd to hear the lily maid Singing her swan song from the eastern tow'r, Or bluff Sir Torre stride thro' the broken halls, Or else his father, dead a year agone, Calling him tenderly as was his wont, And so by always listening to the dead He ceased to hearken to the living voice, And more and more withdrew into himself. But when the next approaching spring had fail'd To stir the languid blood within his veins, The dumb old servitor before him stood One April morning in the castle yard And pointed to the south, and then by signs Essay'd to free his mind, and Sir Lavaine, Half comprehending, asked him, âShall I go Thither?â Thereat the dumb old man nodded, His finger once more pointing to the south. So, deeming that his humble servitor Had deeper knowledge of the best, Lavaine, A little later gathering the few Who serv'd for love, not hire, within the halls Of Astolat, past with them into lands Of Cornish name, and made a home for them And for himself; and, marrying a maid Of Cornish race, saw children of his own And all the past became a memory. Before his home in Cornwall lay the sea, And a thick wood behind it northward stretch'd But to the left a dusty white road climb'd A hill on which there frown'd a single tow'r, And on the farther side a hamlet slept In peace and plenty, owning him for lord. There o'er his Cornish castle past the years From churlish winter into spring until Ten times the ash buds blackened with the winds Of March since blameless Arthur past beyond The mournful gaze of bold Sir Bedivere. A younger copy of himself, or like Himself when but eight tender seasons old, Now listen'd, wonder-ey'd, to Sir Lavaine When he would talk of arms and of the last Great day in Lyonnesse. Jack had the lad Been call'd for some past claimant for the hand Of her Lavaine call'd wife, yet this Lavaine Knew not, but deem'd the unfamiliar name A careless fancy of his Cornish wife's, Whose lightest fancy 'twas his care to please. Slender the lad, as once his father was, But all the blood of lusty Astolat Made summer in his veins. Seldom apart From him his sister Gillian was, and each Without the other droopt and pin'd. Most like Her aunt, the dead Elaine, young Gillian seem'd, And oft the father, looking at her, felt Remembrance of the distant past confuse The present, till if he were boy or man And this his child or playmate sister seem'd Sometimes a thing of doubt. The two, the maid And Jack, lov'd better than all else to climb The long white road, that steep and stony, led Up to the single, broken, frowning tow'r. Four trees beside the tow'r bent o'er a spring That broke from out a sombre, rocky cleft. Here Tristram once had drunk with fair Iseult, Mark's wife, and laught to see the shining drops Slip thro' her fingers, when she held her hand Cupwise, that he might drink therefrom. And here Had sweet Sir Percivale once stopt to drink, Returning from the Quest of Holy Grail; Here, too, had Pelleas, the bright boy knight, A brief hour linger'd, flying from the court In that dark time when all his early faith In woman's virtue died, and good Sir Bors, The false Gawain, the pure Sir Galahad, And many more of that great Table Round Had drunk from these sweet waters to their gain. Full oft had Gillian and the stripling Jack Bent o'er the spring as bent the trees above, And laught to see two faces gazing up, One fair and pale, the other fair and red. Maid Gillian's was the one, the other his. Now as it hapt, Lavaine in that tenth year Fell ill of some dull fever in the blood, And twenty mornings past and still the knight Felt the slow poison creeping thro' his veins And grew at last indifferent to the end. To him maid Gillian pityingly came And said with tears: âSure am I that one thing Would cure this deadly fever.â Then Lavaine: âYea, dost thou think it, little maid? then let Me hear.â Then she: âA draught of water brought From spring beside the tow'r would cure, so pure It is and sweet, and Jack and I would bring It gladly an' 'twould please you drink, my lord.â To whom the sick man answer'd wearily, Yet thinking she by chance had spoken truth As he bethought him of the water's fame: âChild, since you wish it, bring, and I will drink.â Thereat and lightly sprang the maiden down The steps that led to outer air, and close Beside came Jack, a silver vessel swung From one small hand, and so the childish twain Went up the hill and quickly reach'd its top. Then Jack, with Gill beside, stoopt low and fill'd The vessel till the drops did chase themselves All down its burnisht sides. This done, they left The spring, and holding each the vessel's rim, Return'd as they had come, but slower, lest By haste the precious draught were spilt and lost. Then as in distance smaller grew the tow'r Behind, the maid broke out in tender song: âSweet is the sunshine coming after rain; And sweet this water unto lips in pain: Which is the sweeter? that in truth know I. âLight, art thou sweet? then sweeter waters be: Light, thou art grateful; sweet this draught to me. O light, if death be near him, let me die. âSweet light that fades at eve too soon away, Sweet waters springing from the dark to day, Which is the sweeter? that in truth know I. âPain, follow night, and henceforth from him flee; Thou needs must follow night that waits for thee; But, if thou wilt not, then O let me die.â Clear with the last line rang her voice, and Jack, Who heeded not his ways when Gillian sang, Slipt, as the last note ceas'd, upon a piece Of sliding stone, and slipping, fell, dragging The singer down, and both together roll'd, All in a horror of loose stones and dust And flying limbs and broken bones and crowns, Far down the steep side of that rocky hill. So perish'd these two of the fated house Of Astolat; and in the night that follow'd, And near a dawning fierce with wind and rain, Wherein the sea wag'd battle with the sky And both with earth, to final judgment past Lavaine. THE PASSING OF THE SAGES. ARGUMENT. Three wise men of Gotham Went to sea in a bowl; If the bowl had been stronger My story had been longer. Sir VALENCE, son of Eglamour, and last Of ten tall sons who made their father's name A name of all men honor'd ere he past From out the kindly winter of his age To judgment and the unseen life beyond, Mus'd on a mournful midnight o'er the fate That left him, almost ere his beard was grown, Alone, the last of all his race. For these, His stalwart brothers, fell on that great day In Lyonnesse, and he, returning home From embassage to Breton court, had miss'd By passage of a few days the chance of death In battle for his lord. So, coming late To that lone field of combat by the sea, He found nor living friend nor foe, but thick As wave-wash'd pebbles on a wintry shore Forsaken by a faithless ebbing tide, Lay dead his foes and friends. Then part in grief Sir Valence to the chapel nigh the field Where Bedivere the wounded Arthur bore, And all the man within was broken up, And like a sudden fountain flow'd his tears, And like a bitter wailing were his words. âO nevermore,â moaned Valence, âon this earth Shall I the Table Round or Arthur see, For Modred's host have slain the men I lov'd, Not sparing one; and tho' they say our lord, King Arthur, cannot die, and tho' he lies Not dead upon the field, yet he is gone, Yea, he is gone, and all my house are dead. And what henceforth is left to me?â Thus he In loneliness of spirit moan'd aloud, And after past without the chapel down The splinter'd crags to that great water's marge Beneath, thinking the while, âHere will I die.â But while he stood on a wave-eaten rock That thrust itself from shore so far beyond Its fellows that its base was sunk from sight Nine fathoms, and there pois'd himself in act To leap into the surge, an arm arose From out the flashing surface of the lake, âCloth'd in white samite, mystic, wonderful,â And pointed northward, while a great cry shrill'd Thro' all the winter silence, warning him Therefrom. And when the echoes of that cry Had lost themselves among the barren crags, A voice that seem'd to come from east and west And north and south at once, with murm'ring fill'd His ears, but clearer grown, resolv'd itself To this: âThy lord, King Arthur, is not dead, But past into Avilion valleys where There falleth neither rain nor snow, nor blows The gale; but know, Sir Valence, that the way To his blest presence is not by this gate That thou wouldst open.â After this the voice Became a murmur once again and sank To silence, and the mystic arm slipt down Into the bosom of the lake, and night Came striding o'er the hills, and all was dark. Thus warn'd, yet little comforted, the knight, His pathway later lit by waning moon, Past upward from the lake, and thence by slow Removes to lands of his near Cameliard. There he, sole heir to all his father's house Possesst in these its latest, saddest days, A batter'd castle and a ruin'd tow'r, And scanty leagues of marsh thro' which there wound A sullen river, slipping toward the sea, Past languid days of listless idleness Among the few retainers of his house, And gladly would have died if that might be, But fear'd to end his life, remembering The voice. So joyless past the time until A mournful midnight came, sobbing with wind And rain, and while Sir Valence sadly mus'd Beside a fitful, slowly sinking fire, There stood before him Ban, his seneschal, An agÃ¨d man with thousand-wrinkl'd face, Saying a traveller at the castle gate Craved food and shelter for the night. âYea, let Him in,â Sir Valence said, âand bring him here, And set before us bread and meat and wine.â Thereat old Ban departed, but return'd A moment after with a stranger knight, Upon whose bearded face Sir Valence gaz'd An instant doubtfully before he spoke In way of courtesy, because half deem'd He that he knew the man. Then said the knight: âThou know'st me not, Sir Valence, but thy sire Was known to me, and likewise all thy house But thee. Sir Sagramour am I, now bent On errand northward to the court of Lot, But brought by old-time yearning to thy halls To welcome seek from son of Eglamour.â âThou hast it, sweet Sir Sagramour,â then spoke Sir Valence courteously, âalbeit I Have little left to entertain a knight Of such fair presence as he may deserve, Yet what I have is freely thine; I pray You use it willingly as such.â Meantime The thousand-wrinkl'd man had laid the board, And placed thereon a pasty, manchet bread, And gleaming flagons of red wine. Thereto Sir Valence pointed, and the twain sat down, And warm'd their hearts with wine, and nurs'd the while A growing friendship each for other till The fire by Ban re-kindl'd wan'd again. Then Valence, pushing back his chair, began: âI have not seen so glad a time as this Since I return'd from Breton court, and I Beseech you, sweet Sir Sagramour, to bide With me such time as thy affairs allow.â Then made the other answer, graciously, âI find no other pleasure but my host's Within my heart, and therefore will I bide And gladly, here a little space.â So he, Sir Sagramour, abode, and brighter seem'd The castle for his presence, and the heart Of Valence lighter grew: and Sagramour Perceiving this told merry tales, and oft Provok'd his host to mirth: and once the tale Was in this fashion told. âEre Arthur came,â So ran the words of sweet Sir Sagramour, âA petty princedom lying east from here, Held on its seaward border one small town Call'd Gotham, full of strange mad folk, and three There were esteem'd as wise as Merlin was At court of Camelot: and yet the three Were madder than the rest. Now as it chanced These Gotham sages all at once were fill'd With wild desire to travel on the sea Before their doors, and many plans they laid To bring to pass fulfilment of desire; But all were fruitless, till one happy day The maddest of the three within his brain Conceiv'd the fancy of a giant bowl Of wood which might be sent upon the sea, Whilst they within, all jubilant, might ride. So half the men in Gotham set at work To make the bowl; and when 'twas done and launch'd, The sages, sitting on the bowl's sharp edge, Their voices lifted high in gleeful song. ââO sun, that shinest sweetest on the wise, O moon, that flingst a veil across our eyes, Shine softly: now our bowl hath toucht the sea. ââO poppies red that lull us quick to sleep, O poppies red that drowsy secrets keep, Blow softly; twice our bowl hath dipt the sea. ââO owls, that carol in the fearsome dark, O owls, that carol sweeter than the lark, Sing softly: twice our bowl hath dipt the sea.â âSo sang the Gotham wise men, while the bowl Upon an ebbing tide mov'd from the shore, And as their figures blurr'd with distance, sang Again, and fainter both the tune and words. ââO sea-bowl, tossing on the watery crest, O sea-bowl, with three sages in thy breast, Toss gently, thrice our bowl hath dipt the sea.â âThereafter,â said Sir Sagramour, âthere came A fierce, wild gale from out the north,ââthen paus'd As one whose tale is done. âWhat then?â here spoke The host, impatient of the pause. Whereat The other: âLonger far had been my tale If Gotham's giant bowl had stronger been. But come, we waste the hours; I pray you go With me to Orkney. In a month we will Return.â CONSTANTIUS AND HELENA. ARGUMENT. âOld King Cole Was a merry old soul, And a merry old soul was he: He called for his pipe And he called for his bowl, And he called for his fiddlers three.â King COÃLUSâthe first of Britain's kings Who made the legions sent from overseas By Rome, with CÃ¦sar's eagles at their head, Pause in their northward marching from the coastâ Upon a stormful night in April forced His way, with all his warriors at his back, (In number as the needles of the pine, And like the pine in sinewy strength and height,) Past Roman guards and sentinels o'erthrown And slain, to where the sacred eagles blaz'd, In fitful glare of torch and beacon ray, Within the town Camelodunum call'd, High on the hill that overlooks the Colne. So all that stormful night the Roman blood Incarnadined the Colne, and all the slopes Were strewn with carnage; and the dawning came And shot red rays athwart the crimson pools, And o'er the heaps of Roman dead, and o'er The joyous horde of Cole victorious, And red was all the land. Thus broke the king The power of distant Rome, or so it seem'd; And merrily did CoÃ¯lus rebuild The city, calling to his aid the might Of Bleys, the great magician, he who made Brandagoras of Latangor his slave A twelvemonth's space because of insult done Some ancient shrine; and on the heights arose Camelodunum fairer than before, A mighty city, girdl'd round with walls That mounted skyward and yet fail'd to hide The tow'rs and spires that lost themselves in air. There, in the carv'd stone palace built by Bleys, King CoÃ¯lus liv'd merrily and well: And with him Helena, his child, the pride And chief delight of CoÃ¯lus, and fair As maid may be on this our earth and seem In any wise as one of earth; and oft The merry king, regarding her, was mute With memories of one who look'd like her Some twenty changeful changing seasons back,â The maiden's mother, and the only child Of Urien of Wales. Now while the king Past merry days surrounded by his lords, And lov'd by all, from Helena his child To poorest beggar that e'er crav'd an alms, Far overseas the legions gather'd strength, And passing with their eagles o'er the strait That lay between the chalk-white cliffs and Gaul, Halted before Camelodunum's walls, And strove, but vainly, 'gainst the might of Cole, As strives some ardent climber some high cliff To scale that beetles o'er its base, or waves That fain would overleap the same sheer height, And striving ever, ever fail. Nathless, Undaunted as the surge, Constantius, The Roman leader, lay before the walls With all the flower of Rome within his camp, Till thrice the summer into autumn past, And thrice the dead leaves redden'd all the Colne, And thrice the bitter winds of winter rav'd, And thrice the lark became âa sightless song.â But when the third springtide was wellnigh past, Constantius, despairing of success, Was mov'd to raise the siege, since all his art Avail'd him not before the walls uprear'd By Bleys. Yet ere his thought past into act, It chanced that he one morning heard a voice Of mellow sweetness falling through the air, And looking up, he saw fair Helena Upon the walls, and listening, he heard The words she sang, and hearing, straightway fell In longing for the maid, and seeing, blest The gods who granted him so fair a sight. But she upon the walls sang on as one Who sings for joy of heart, not heeding him, Or seeming not to heed Constantius, Who, far below, listen'd and look'd and lov'd. âA star, but one, one only star saw I, A star, one star, far through the frosty air, One star, a star that lighten'd all my sky, One star, my star, that sparkl'd past compare,â I reck'd not of the cold, the star was there. âOne star, a star that seem'd far off, yet nigh, One star, one star with rays that shimmer'd fair, No star but one, none other star saw I. One star, my star; a star that cannot die,â They miss who seek it if the moon be there.â âMy star, one star, none other star for me,â Constantius said within himself whenas The song was ended and the singer gone From off the walls, and, ere the sun had paus'd In high mid-heaven, and the noontide hour Was hammer'd out from tower and spire, the King, Within the carven palace built by Bleys, Was told a messenger from Roman camp Crav'd speedy hearing for his message brought. Bluster'd King Cole: âYea, let him in: I fain Would know what he, my foe, Constantius, Would say to me by churl of his.â Low bow'd The Roman, entering, at the feet of Cole, To whom that other spake through frosty beard, âThou hast a message: speak, and let me hear.â Thereat the messenger: âO CoÃ¯lus! Constantius knows thee great, believes thee wise Beyond the measure of all other men, And gladly would exchange the name of foe With thee for that of friend; and therefore he, My master, offers peace,âsuch peace as broods O'er lands where plenteous content is lord, And one condition only doth this peace Stand fast upon: that he may have to wife The princess Helena.â He ceas'd and bow'd Once more, while CoÃ¯lus revolv'd in thought The message of Constantius, inclin'd The more to grant the Roman leader's prayer, Since he was much awearied of the siege Which kept him in Camelodunum pent. So, turning to the lords about him, spake: âYou heard this Roman: what say you, my lords?â But staying not for answer, bade one call His daughter Helena, who straightway came. To her the King made known the Roman's wish, And added, âNow what says my Helena Unto the suit of brave Constantius?â Now it had chanced that Helen, while she sang, Had with a sidelong azure-lidded eye Beheld the Roman leader far below, Yet not so far but she might see his gaze Rapt upon her, and seeing lov'd in turn. Therefore when Cole, the merry, question'd her What should be said, she rais'd an innocent face And murmur'd: âSurely peace is sweet to have, My father: who am I to bar the door Against it, and prolong the doleful siege?â So peace was made, and Helena was wed Unto Constantius, and all the bells Of great Camelodunum rang, and Cole, The merry, at the marriage call'd for pipes And bowl, and flowing bowl and pipes, and while The pipers drank great draughts from out the bowl, Call'd loudly for his fiddlers three. A Tale of Tuscany. An Old-World tale. Who reads perchance May deem it dull or idly told, Preferring latter-day romance Where well trained hearts their loves unfold. Tuscany, land of fierce hates and wild loves and of limitless passions, Tuscany, home of Petrarca and Dante and lively Boccaccio, Tuscany, home of the Angelic Painter revered throughout Europe, Thou art the scene of this story: in thee all its actors lie buried. Near to a stream that escaped from Fiesole's heights and that wandered Down through vast forests of chestnut and unto the plain that stretched eastward, Where it meandered at will until lost in the turbulent Arno, Stood in the days when the land was ruled o'er by the mighty Lorenzo, Stood, and still stands, although now but a ruin, four centuries later, Villa Alberti, the home of a youthful and passionate noble Known far and wide for his pitiless temper that recked not of mercy. Cosmo Alberti his name, and for wife he had taken Bianca, One of the house of Bordoni and daughter of Luigi Bordoni Many times chosen a prior of merchants of silk in Firenze. Fair was the face of the maid and her voice was as sweet as the nightingale's Heard in mid-May when the forest rejoices in newly-won verdure. Gracious her manner to all and so great was the charm of her presence That at the banquets the wealth and the pride of Firenze attended None of its maidens were paid so much honor as gentle Bianca. Simple and fresh was her spirit despite all the praise she excited Equal in measure from amorous youth and from grey-headed statesmen. Nor was the fame of her beauty and sweetness confined to Firenze; Roman ambassadors when they returned to the City Eternal Spoke of it freely, while light-hearted gallants of Pisa and Lucca, Passing a season in Tuscany's proudest of cities, Firenze, Spread on returning the praise of the beautiful Florentine maiden. But, as it chanced, unto Cosmo Alberti, her name was a strange one Even when Tuscany rang with her manifold virtues and graces, For from his villa he seldom went forth to the city, preferring Either to follow his own lawless will in his wide-spread dominion, Or to engage in some feud with a neighbor and, coming off victor, Harry his rival to death and then seize upon all his possessions. Yet unto him at last tidings of Bordoni's daughter were wafted, And, in a moment when 'customed delights seemed to pall on his spirit, Thoughts of Bianca Bordoni came into his mind and he wondered What she was like and if all that was said of her pictured her truly. With Cosmo Alberti to think was to act, and thus happed it Firenze Saw him one day in her streets, unto which he had long been a stranger, Saw him and greeted him kindly, as Florentine prudence suggested; Nor was it long before he of the Villa Alberti was granted Sight of the maiden the fame of whose charms had lured him from his castle. Pietro Brignoli, whose daughter a noble young Pisan had wedded, Gave on the day of the bridal a banquet to which were invited All of the rank and the wealth of Firenze and likewise were summoned Strangers of rank from without, and amongst these was Cosmo Alberti. Handsome was he in his costume well-fitting his station and figure, Marked among men would he be anywhere, and full many a maiden Gazing upon him felt something of love stir within her for Cosmo, Cosmo, whose eyes were for one, and one only, and that one Bianca. Singing was she when he saw her, a song that was made for the bridal. Sweet were the words of the song, for sweet love was the theme of the writer, Guido Donati his name, and the words of his song were on this wise: What is the dearest of treasures? What is the sweetest of pleasures? Bliss that o'errunneth all measures? Love is its name. It is Love! Sweet is the bliss of pursuing, Dear is the joy of the wooing; Happiness lies in subduing Hearts that are strangers to Love. Whispered its vows are and tender; Virtue its strongest defender; Every true heart longs to render Homage and honors to Love. Ended the music, arose a great clamor of eloquent voices Praising the song and the singer and loudest was Cosmo Alberti's. Ne'er had he known until now these emotions that filled him with longing; Never till now had he felt what it was to love purely and nobly. Love for the moment transformed his rough nature to chivalrous manhood, Lent a new grace to his manner and softened the ring of his laughter. Scarce would the servants of Villa Alberti have known their young master Could they have seen him that evening at Messer Pietro Brignoli's. After the banquet the bridegroom and bride led the dancing together, And in their steps followed gladly the Florentine maidens and gallants, Crossing, recrossing, and turning wherever the measure demanded, Touching the tips of the fingers and bowing at every turning. Not the least graceful was Cosmo Alberti, who, joining the dancers, Joyfully found himself frequently facing Bianca Bordoni, Who for her part was well-pleased when she noted the handsome Alberti Eying her every movement and eagerly craving her favor. Long was the dance but it ended at length and the dancers departed, Cosmo amongst them, his thoughts full of Bordoni's beautiful daughter, Whom he determined to gain, and he therefore remained in Firenze Week after week, and so constant was he in attending all banquets Whereto Bianca was bidden that every one saw his devotion. âSee what a tamer is Love,â said the gossips in strada and loggia; âWho would have dreamed that the savage young boar of the Villa Alberti Would have forsaken his sports and his fighting for love of a maiden.â Not unobserved by Bordoni the evident purpose of Cosmo, Purpose that had for its object the gaining the love of his daughter, And not ill-pleased was the father, who viewed young Alberti with favor. As for Bianca herself she but faintly at this time remembered Tales she had heard of his deeds and his temper so cruel, For when his face was before her they seemed like the veriest fancies Born of the envy of those not so handsome and daring as Cosmo. So as the summer departed and Tuscany's autumn descending Touched with the finger of fire all the trees in the plain of the Arno, Cosmo, not doubting Bianca's affection, demanded of Luigi Hand of the maiden in marriage, whereat old Bordoni, concealing Back of his calmness of face all the joy that he felt, for a moment Seemed not to favor distinctly the suit of the ardent young Cosmo, But as if moved by the arguments earnestly urged by the other, Yielded at last, as doth one overborne, and consented. Then gladly Hastened the passionate Cosmo to gentle Bianca awaiting News of her lover's success and as they sat together in silence, Fuller of meaning than words could be ever, Luigi Bordoni, Dignified, portly and handsome in garments of riches black velvet, Came where they sat and spoke gravely of life and its manifold duties, Spoke of the pain at his heart that would follow the loss of Bianca, Spoke of the rumors that reached him of Cosmo's undisciplined temper, Urged the young noble to govern his household and people with kindness, Said a few words of the happiness marriage had brought to his own life, Hoped for as much in their future, and left them at length with his blessing. Fixed was the bridal for April, and all through the winter young Cosmo Busied himself with restoring a wing of the Villa Alberti, Rearing a tower and extending the loggia and planning out gardens, Gardens which now are a wildwood, yet peopled with moss-covered statues, Showing, however, though armless and shattered, the lines of the beauty Fixed there of old by the wonderful skill of some long-vanished sculptor. So passed the winter with Cosmo, who, full of his plans and his raptures, Found little time for pursuing old feuds with his neighbors, who therefore Dwelt for the winter in peace and most fervently thanked the occasion. Easter came early in April that season but not till the springtide Filled the Val d'Arno with tremulous greenness and starred it with blossoms, While on Fiesole's heights waved the newly-won sprays of the chestnut, Sprays through which flickered the sunshine on pink-flushing buds of the laurel. Nor was the brightness of Tuscany's springtime confined to the country, Strada, piazza and loggia in every part of Firenze Brimmed and ran over with flowers, and at Easter their delicate fragrance Conquered at mass and at vespers the odors of myrrh and frankincense Stealing from censers of brass swung by thurifers at the high altars. Scarcely had Holy Week passed when the rigors of Lent were forgotten, Save by the monks in their cells and the nuns in their cloisters, For in the Easter week happened the wedding at Casa Bordoni, Wedding long talked of before by the youth and the maids of Firenze, Bridal long talked of thereafter because of its wonderful splendor. Not for a decade at least had been seen in the City of Flowers Marriage attended with jubilant mirth and with pomp like to this one. Guests from Siena and Lucca and Pisa and Rome the Eternal, Brilliant in silks and in velvets and flashing with gold chains and jewels, Sat at the banquet that followed the solemn high mass at the Duomo, Sat beside Florentine nobles as richly arrayed, and among them Grey-bearded priors of arts and stout matrons who once had been shapely, Maidens as stately as lilies and children half-dazed with the splendor, Mingled in friendliness born of the joy that abounds at a bridal. Many the healths that were drunk in behalf of the newly-wed couple; Many the wishes expressed for their happiness and to these Cosmo Gracefully worded his thanks, and, the banquet once ended, the dancing Followed it swiftly, but even more rapidly twinkled to music Feet of the dancers in rhythmical measures, and lastly succeeded Chorus of youths and of maidens with clear ringing voices all singing, (Melody wondrous and sweet,) a fair marriage song writ for the bridal: When in the springtime a soft wind arises Out of the south land and sweetly surprises Fair folded buds from their sleep into roses, Breathes on the lily till rathe it uncloses, Hearts that are saddest lose some of their sorrow, Hearts that are lightest a keener joy borrow, When in the springtime a south wind arises And in its bounty all fair gifts comprises. When in the springtime two hearts are united, Pleasure is crowned and dull pain is affrighted, Love lights the path where the blissful ones wander Thinking no evil and growing yet fonder. Never such rapture by mortals is tasted As clings to the days when ere April is wasted, Pain being past and all jealousy blighted, Hearts in the dearest of bonds are united. So the long waiting was over and these two, Bianca and Cosmo, Entered upon that new life which to some is a quickly sped pleasure Vanished as soon as the moon of the bridal is over and nothing Left for the lifetime which follows but weariness, hatred and loathing, But which for others is full of the joy that endureth for all time, Joy that is sister to peace and abideth forever in calmness. How it would be with these two was the wonder of half of Firenze Holding in mind the reports of his pitiless temper aforetime. Somewhat disturbed in his spirit was ancient Luigi Bordoni Sitting alone in his palace bereft of Bianca and doubting Whether ambition were safest to follow when wedding a daughter Tender and loving as his was, and whether young Cosmo Alberti Loved her enough to subdue for her sake all his outbursts of passion. Often and often he rode to the gates of the Villa Alberti, Entered and found in the gardens or sitting at ease in the loggia Happiness ever and blissful content with Bianca and Cosmo. Welcome he never found lacking and so as the days journeyed onward Fainter his doubtings became and at last past away altogether Utterly routed and slain by the radiant presence of gladness. Now in these halcyon days the great happiness compassing these two Spread its white wings over all who owed service to Cosmo. Wholly transformed seemed the man through his love for the gentle Bianca. It was enough for him now that she pleaded for any retainer, Seeking for justice to all, and the noble who once had sought counsel Only from whim of the moment or spurring of sudden-moved passion, Now was renowned throughout spacious Val d'Arno for merciful dealing. Many the banquets and feastings at Villa Alberti that summer. Often the peasant on lands of Alberti was roused from his slumbers Nigh to the hour when the pale rose of dawn in the east faintly quickens, Hearing the rolling of wheels and the querulous neighing of horses Speeding with jubilant revelers back to their homes in Firenze. All who could add to the joy of the moment were welcomed by Cosmo. So at the Villa Alberti were gathered in friendly conjunction Poets, musicians and artists of differing orders of merit, Nobles and sages and men who were keen at a jest or a satire. There might be seen the fair matrons and maids of the City of Florence, Cassock of priest, or the purple-hued robe of the dignified prelate, Merchants returned from a visit to Paris or far-distant London, Courtiers from France or ambassadors sent from some German dominion. Many the faiths of the guests but a harmony never was lacking, For at these meetings Bianchi and Neri forgot for the moment Matters at issue between them, and even the Ghibelline faction Here at the Villa Alberti held truce with the Guelphs their opponents, Glad it would seem for an interval sacred to peace and good feeling. When the fierce heats of the summer were over and Tuscany's autumn Once more returning had purpled the vineyards and yellowed the cornfields, Veiled with a haze the far peaks of Carrara and breathed forth at evening Hints, though but faint ones as yet, of the oncoming chillier weather, Luigi Bordoni one morning rode forth to his daughter Bianca's, Not, as his wont was, alone, but companioned upon this occasion By a fair youth, the last left of the sons of a dearly-loved brother. Nearly two years had he been at Ferrara on business of Luigi's, But it was ended at last and the youth had returned to Firenze Only that morning brimful of rejoicing at seeing his kindred. Joyous the meeting had been 'twixt the uncle and well-beloved nephew, And in reply to his questionings after Bianca, his cousin, Messer Bordoni was leading the youth to the Villa Alberti. Scarce twenty-one was Franceso Bordoni when leaving Firenze; Lightly at that time the down on his upper lip lay like a shadow, But, in his absence had lengthened and darkened till now on returning Straight as a dart a full finger's length sideways it slenderly pointed, Under it gleamed the white teeth that his clear ringing laughter showed often, And 'neath the forehead above it two dark eyes looked honestly outward, Eyes that the maids of Ferrara had many times loved to feel on them. Slenderly built was the youth but withal of an elegant figure, Habited richly in garments befitting his years and his station. Crimson and white was his doublet and likewise his close-fitting long hose Crimson of hue, and a mantle that carelessly hung from his shoulder White, with a lining of crimson, showed also the colors he favored. Crimson moreover the cap that he wore and that poised as if blown there Crowning the grace that yet needed no help of costume to display it. Over his doublet there hung a gold chain wrought by skill of Cellini, And at his side was a sword which the same Benvenuto Cellini, Seized with a master's own fancy, enriched with a wonderful scabbard Where was depicted the sorrowful story of her of Rimini. Goodly in raiment and person alike was the youthful Franceso, And as he journeyed that morning along with his uncle, Luigi Said to himself that the youth was a joy to the house of Bordoni. Noon was the hour when the uncle and nephew reached Villa Alberti; Noon, and the shadows that lay on the greensward were dwarfed and misshapen; Noon, and the breezes of morning had died quite away into stillness; Noon, and the birds were asleep and the musical plash of the fountains Joyously leaping aloft in the sunshine and falling back ever Scarce broke the slumberous silence that brooded o'er all like a blessing. âAh, what a haven of peace!â said Franceso aloud to his uncle, âTruly a fitting abode for my beautiful cousin Bianca.â Hardly the sentence was uttered when she whom he spoke of came forward Beaming with joy at beholding her father and long-absent cousin. âSurely, Franceso, your stay in Ferrara has wondrously changed you, For when you left us you seemed like a boy and to-day I behold you Bearing the honors of manhood like any young Florentine gallant.â Smiling she spoke and the youth in confusion bowed lowly before her, Paused for a moment and then answered gayly, âMy cousin Bianca, Time has been busy with you and has changed from a girl to a woman Her whom I left in the care of the vigilant Sisters of Joseph, Learning from them to embroider and also the curing of roseleaves.â More had he said, but the master of Villa Alberti approaching Greeted the newcomers warmly and led the way into the Villa. There for a time they conversed with each other of various matters, Whether the eloquent Savonarola would preach at the Duomo After the autumn was over and Advent had opened the winter, Whether the turbulent Arrabbiati would dare to molest him, Whether the harvests throughout the Val d' Arno were promising finely, Whether the air of Firenze was purer than that of Ferrara. So passed the morning away until Cosmo, addressing Bianca, Said in his courtliest manner, âBianca, your cousin Franceso, If he has rested as long as he wishes, might care to examine Under your guidance the gardens, or possibly also the frescos Painted last spring, my Bianca, in honor of you and our bridal. Go with him therefore, I pray you, and I and our excellent father Later will join you, perhaps in the gardens or else in the loggia.â Ended his sentence, the speaker arose and passed out with Luigi Full of some plan for adorning the Villa which needed explaining, And at an opposite portal Bianca went forth with her cousin. Much had Franceso to speak of concerning the years of his absence; Much had Bianca to tell him of Cosmo and how he adored her. Almost like brother and sister the cousins had been in their childhood, Sharing their joys and their sorrows and each one admiring the other. Now as they loitered in arbor and alley in innocent converse, Confidence, long interrupted by absence, returned, and the friendship Severed by time reunited and freely they spoke to each other; He of the maiden he loved at Ferrara with ardent devotion, How he would count himself happy if only Bianca might see her, For he was sure she would think the maid wondrously lovely. When he had ended she told of her meeting with Cosmo last summer, How she had loved from the first this young lord whom Pietro Brignoli Summoned with others to dance and to feast at the fÃªte of his daughter. How she had feared while she loved him, recalling the tales that were told her, Tales that proclaimed him as cruel, and wholly unmindful of kindness, But unto her he was gentle and tender, and courteous ever. Since they were wedded his love had not lost in the least its deep fervor, And his dependents united, she added, in praising their master. âHappier woman than I am most surely is none in Firenze,â Gleefully ended Bianca her story of Cosmo's devotion. Thus as it happened the youthful and handsome Franceso Bordoni, Once more abiding with Luigi his uncle, in Casa Bordoni, Welcome most cordial received from his cousin the wife of Alberti, Welcome in which Cosmo joined with the zeal of impetuous natures. Frequent the journeys he made from Firenze to Villa Alberti, For as the autumn departed the beautiful maid of Ferrara, Wholly unknown to herself, was supplanted by one in Firenze, Wherefore Franceso the fickle had much to impart to his cousin Of the new rapture he fervently vowed should endure for a lifetime. Smilingly listened Bianca and wholly refrained from reproaching, Feeling quite sure that his heart was untouched by the one or the other; Hoping moreover in time to divert his uncertain affections Into a steadier channel and fix them on one of her own friends, Giulia Donati, the well-beloved child of a Florentine noble. So the youth went and returned at his pleasure, and sober-paced autumn Glided unseen into winter, so mild was the weather, and Cosmo Welcomed him always as one might a brother and dreamed of no evil. So might it ever have been but for one who had noted Franceso Coming and going at will and moreover seen oft with Bianca. Into the brain of Battista Marchesi, a friend of Alberti's, Entered suspicion at once as a guest and found ample employment, When he beheld the young nephew of ancient Luigi Bordoni Gladly received by Bianca, against whom he cherished resentment Dating from days when he sued as a lover and won not her favor. Long had he sighed for revenge and the moment for this seemed approaching. Cautious, however, was he, and he waited some time before speaking, But when December was come and Battista was hunting with Cosmo, Far from Firenze on slopes of the Apennine Alps near Carrara, Chance as it seemed led their talk to Bianca and Villa Alberti. âAh, 'tis a week since I left my Bianca!â said Cosmo, âand lonely Truly I know she will be, so to-morrow must find me returning.â âLonely, good Cosmo?â then answered him crafty Marchesi, âbut surely That is your vanity speaking. Bianca can very well spare you, Just for a little at least, for what wife will not tire of her husband Having him constantly by her and hearing his words of devotion. Then she has with her the beautiful Giulia Donati and likewise Paola Lippi and other fair maids of Firenze and doubtless Handsome Franceso Bordoni is there at the Villa this moment Telling some wonderful tale or exciting their mirth by his jesting. O, she is doing quite well in your absence without you, good Cosmo. Better remain while the hunting is good than to think of returning. She is quite safe in the care of her friends and her cousin Franceso.â Loudly laughed Cosmo when subtle Battista had finished, and answered: âLittle you know of Bianca's affection for me, good Battista; She is not like many wives who rejoice when their husbands are absent; Ever her thoughts are of me and I surely must see her to-morrow.â âTake your own course, my dear friend,â said Battista, in answer, âand doubtless You are quite right and Bianca, your wife, in your absence is lonely. Pardon me, Cosmo, if I in a moment of jesting spoke lightly Of the affection a wife like Bianca must feel for her husband. Let it forever be buried and now let us speak of Franceso; Surely a more pleasant subject is he with his easy good-nature. How half the maids in Firenze adore him, and yet 'tis no wonder; Who might not conquer and win the most obdurate heart in the city Had he the graces of person and eloquent tongue of Franceso. Even the matrons regard him with pleasure and almost affection. Almost, said I, nay 'tis rumored that one or two matrons whose husbands Absent just now are from home, seem disposed to the granting of favors Unto Franceso, the handsome, which doubtless the youth has accepted, Being adept in affairs of the kind, if I do not mistake him. Ah, what it is to be handsome and young and thus favored of women!â Thus unto Cosmo spoke wily Marchesi and failed not to notice Over the brow of the friend at his side a dark shadow was creeping; Noticed and inly rejoiced and continued his talk of Franceso, Praising the youth as before and enlarging upon his attractions. Then as a close to his words very craftily added, âMy Cosmo, You should know best and no doubt you are right in returning to-morrow. Truly so tender and loving a wife as is yours must be lonely. Go if you will, as for me I will hunt by myself awhile longer.â Little said Cosmo the rest of that day to his friend and companion. Dark was his brow as the clouds that drive over the sky in a tempest; Heavy his heart with the weight of suspicion that suddenly lodged there; So on the morrow he turned his face eastward and reached home at nightfall. Peaceful and quiet the short day had passed for Bianca Alberti Busied with womanly cares and with no one at hand to distract her. Paola Lippi with Giulia had ere this returned to Firenze, And on that day quite alone had she been till Franceso at sunset Came to the Villa to beg her assistance in gaining the favor Of his last love, the adorable, wonderful Giulia Donati. Glad was Bianca to find where his wishes now pointed and promised All in her power to incline to his suit the dear friend of her girlhood. Loud was the youth in his thanks as they sat in the loggia together While the bright moonlight streamed over their faces and one in the garden Watched them with wrath in his heart and a tremulous hand on his dagger. So passed an hour, and Franceso departing sped down to the garden Trusting to find at the entrance his charger awaiting its master. Crimson and white was his garb as of old, and his cap with its tassel Lightly was tossed on a head that was full of a lover's bright fancies. Singing a song was the youth as he passed down the garden, and Cosmo, Wholly unheeded by him, came behind with his dagger and ended With but one thrust the sweet song and the harmless young life of the singer. Crimson and white were the colors Franceso in life had most favored; Crimson and white in his death lay the blithesome Franceso Bordoni. Long had lain dormant the turbulent passions of Cosmo Alberti; Dormant and harmless they seemed until roused by the wily Battista. Fiercer than ever the tempest that now raged unchecked in his bosom, Tempest awakened at first by the devilish craft of Marchesi, Tempest now roused to full height when before him lay lifeless Franceso. Dragging Bordoni away from the path he strode up to the Villa, Entered and meeting his most trusted servant, Arnoldo Sacchetti, Told him in brief what had chanced and then charged him to keep the dread secret, Bidding him also to safely conceal the dead form of Franceso; Then with a smile on his lips straightway passed to the rooms of Bianca. Glad was Bianca when Cosmo she saw and most tender her welcome, Tender moreover was he and the fire that had now blazed so hotly, Seemed to have sunk into ashes so loving and gentle his manner. Doubted he then for a moment, so genuine seemed her affection, Whether the deed were well done that had ended the life of Franceso, Till there returned the suspicions Marchesi in him had implanted. But to Bianca his look at that time betrayed nothing but gladness And in her joy at his coming no mention she made of Franceso Even when days past away and no more was he seen at the Villa. Absent just then from Firenze was Luigi Bordoni, his uncle So that the youth was not missed from the city except by companions Young like himself, and who fancied him absent on some lover's journey. Troubled in spirit was Cosmo, perceiving no trace in Bianca Of the dismay he had looked for when day after day brought no lover, Troubled in spirit, yet not the less fixed in his direful purpose, Purpose which waited in silence the moment most fit for disclosing. More than a week past away when one morning Bianca said lightly: âWhat can have chanced to Franceso? He seems to have left us entirely. When you were absent, my Cosmo, he came every day to the Villa. That was when Giulia Donati was here, whom he loves beyond measure.â âHe will be with us this even at supper,â said Cosmo in answer, âFull of a lover's excuses, no doubt, to account for his absence.â Even was come and together they past to the hall of the banquet, Where on the table a cover was laid for the coming Franceso. âShall we not drink to the health of your amorous cousin, Bianca, Ere he arrives at the Villa?â and gladly Bianca assented. Then at a sign from his master Arnoldo Sacchetti brought forward Rarest of wines and moreover a silver-rimmed skull for a goblet. This to Bianca he gave and Alberti said gently, âBianca, It is a fancy of mine you should drink from that goblet this evening. Not the most pleasant of fancies, 'tis true, but you will not refuse me?â Somewhat reluctant at first, but assured by the words of her husband, Quickly she drank and Arnoldo Sacchetti announced at that moment, âMesser Franceso Bordoni,â and opened the doors of a closet. There with a mantle of crimson and white hanging loose from the shoulder Stood a grim skeleton awful and white in the down-streaming lamplight. Frozen with horror Bianca stared rigidly forward while Cosmo, Eying her sternly, burst forth in his passion: âYour lover, Franceso, Waits for you there in his closet: why linger so long ere you greet him? That is his skull which you drank from, a pleasing love-token he sends you: Strange that you shrink from him now whom you lately preferred to your husband: What? have you nothing to say to the amorous youth who adores you?â Slowly Bianca arose and then turning to Cosmo said firmly: âNever in word or in deed have I sinned 'gainst the bond that unites us: Him you have slain was no lover of mine. I was yours and yours only. Happy was I in your love and I foolishly deemed it eternal. Were I the woman you think, I might readily crave your forgiveness; Being the innocent wife that I am, I now leave you forever.â Scarcely the sentence was uttered ere she who had spoken fell lifeless, Dying heart-broken, and he whose accusings had suddenly killed her, Stood there alone, for Sacchetti had vanished, alone with Bianca. Now when too late he believed in her innocence wholly, entirely; Now when too late he perceived the abominable craft of Marchesi; Now in his anguish, by furies pursued, he fled into the forest. Empty the Villa Alberti henceforward, for no one would dwell there. Gone was its master and no one knew whither for many years after, Till as it happened a hunter pursuing a deer near Carrara, Found in a desolate hollow two skeletons lying together, Locked in a deadly embrace, and by shreds of their clothing and jewels, Knew them for Cosmo Alberti and crafty Battista Marchesi. The Golden Lotus. In far Japan this story old Is carved in ivory, graved in brass, For jealous Fame, who loves the bold, Lets not the gracious memory pass. The amber sunset faded into night, And round the base of lofty Dandoku The ever-present shadows in the woods Clung closer to the forest depths, yet rose, Still clinging, from the mountain's shaggy knees To shining cone of snow that pierced the sky, And still and breathless grew the darkened land. Slow past the hours till in the east faint lights Wavered awhile, then eddied into calm And waxed apace, and from their midst, blood-red, An angry moon sailed up a cloudless sky, And all the peering shadows backward pressed, Each upon other, ever clustering thick To rearward of each bush and tree. But when The blood-red splendor of the moon had paled To white, and long and level rays became Long rays that sloped from heaven's mid-height, there past Down Dandoku's steep sides the merciful Shaka-ni-yorai, full of holy thoughts. No sound yet broke the silence, save when now And then a stone, dislodged by Shaka's steps, Smote sharply 'gainst its neighbor rocks, or bird, Half-roused by passing feet, fluttered a wing Or chirped a sleepy note. No sound save these, Till rose from out a jagged mountain cleft A mystic voice that rang around the sky And trembled to the limits of the world, Proclaiming one of Buddha's sacred truths: Not always does the outward guise denote The complex substance of the inner soul! Lord Shaka, hearing, paused, then nearer drew Toward the cleft, and peering downward, saw A dragon on whose scales the moombeams shone, And in whose eyes there glittered baleful fires. No fear beset his soul at this strange sight, But all unawed thereat, he by the edge Sat down and questioned of the awful shape Below, whence came this knowledge of the laws, Which years of study had not shown to him. âKnowing so much,â said Shaka, âthou must needs Know more. I wait thy farther word. Say on.â So saying, Shaka sat with joinÃ¨d palms, Patiently waiting, while the dragon coiled Its awful glistening length around the cliff, And once more shook with thunders all the air, As it, regarding Shaka's face serene, Declared: All things that live to Buddha are Opposed! There followed silence for a space, Till Shaka said, âAll that is good thou sayest, All that is good, and yet I wait for more.â He ceased, and suddenly a soundless chill Crept o'er the mountain side, and one dark cloud, Coming from farthest space, enwrapt the moon, And in the chill and through the gloom he heard The awful voice, clear-sounding: All that live Must die! And like an echo come from far And fainter: All that live must die! Thereat The listener bowed himself and said: âThy mouth Hast spoken greater wisdom than before. O clothed with knowledge, still, I pray, say on!â So spake Lord Shaka, and the shape below Turned full on him the lightnings of its eyes, And answered: âLo, the last of these great truths Most precious is of all the four, but weak Am I, and may not utter it without The meat I most desire,â and while he spoke The moon from out the bosom of the cloud Came forth, and showed the dragon loosening Its hold upon the rock, and all its length Supinely stretching forth. Then Shaka said: âO thou so full of highest wisdom art I can deny thee nothing. Name thy will.â Whereat the dragon, rearing high his crest, Made answer like the roll of thunder heard Far off in wake of a retreating storm, âMan's flesh.â All pityingly Lord Shaka gazed Upon the dragon, and made answer thus: âThe Law forbids us to destroy a life, But for the people whom I hope to teach The fourth great sentence I must hear for them; Thereafter will I give myself to thee. And now, O Wisdom-Bearer, tell me all.â The dragon heard, and higher raised its head, And slowly opening its ponderous jaws, Made answer to Lord Shaka: Happiness Is greatest when the soul the body leaves! Rapt on these words the saintly hearer stood A space, then reverently bowed his head And sprang within the dragon's mouth, when lo, A wonder! As Lord Shaka's sacred feet Touched lightly on the shining monster's jaws The crested head sank down and fell apart Eight several ways, and into petals eight That form the throne most holy briefly past And left Lord Shaka seated, calm, serene, Within the bosom of the Mystic Flower! Lyrics, etc. Why turn the page? There's nought o'erleaf To hold attent your thoughtful mind. You will? 'Tis well these lays are brief, If to disparage you're inclined. THE SWEET SOUTH-WIND. Over the fields and the waters there suddenly swept in mid-April Something that seemed like a breath that was blown from far coasts of the sunlands. Languorous was it and sweet as are lilies or odorous spices, Laden with delicate hints of a summer not far in the distance. Over the meadows and fields that, embrowned by the cold of the winter, Lay as if dead to the spring and with never a hope of a harvest, Silently passed the south-wind, and there suddenly sprang into being Millions of grass blades that tossed like an emerald sea in the sunshine, Daffodils fair as were those that gained Pluto a consort in Hades, Buttercups golden and gleaming like gems on the hands of a maiden, Daisies that grew near the ground and yet ever and always gazed upward, Violets azure and yellow and white and of wonderful fragrance. Over the trees in the orchard and forest it breathed in its progress, Bringing the sap from the roots to the near and the farthermost branches, Swelling the buds till the willow was hid in a verdurous mist-cloud, Touching the boughs of the maple that reddened with joy at the meeting, Leaving wherever it lingered assurance and promise of summer. Over the streams the beneficent breeze from the southland swept gently, Filled all the waters with quick-darting life that rejoiced in the springtime, Sent all the rivers, now freed from the grasp of the winter, exultant, Moving in shimmering, glittering, sinuous curves that led seaward. So on its way passed the wonderful wakening wind from the sunlands, Driving before it the frost and the cold of the winter, reluctant, While in their stead came the warmth and the rearoused life of the springtide, For in the wake of the life-giving breeze flew the jubilant swallows, Twittered the robins and wrens, while the azure-hued wing of the bluebird Cut through the air like the scintillant blade that is famed of Toledo. Thus in mid-April the heart of another springtide was awakened; Faster the blood ran along through the veins in the glorious weather, Generous impulses quickened and waxed in the glow of the season. Winter was banished, and with him the cold and the afternoon twilight, And, as the wail of his storms in the north passed at last into silence, May could be seen in the distance approaching, her lap full of blossoms. ON THE LABRADOR COAST. (October, 1885.) Down the coast of Labrador Rode the storm-wind conqueror: In his train the surges roared, From black clouds the torrents poured. Miles on miles of frowning cliffs Marked with Time's strange hieroglyphs Felt the waves their bases shock, Heard strange cries that seemed to mock With their shrill discordant glee Sounds of human agony. Drifting wildly with the blast Scores of vessels southward past. Down upon their rain-swept decks Leaped the surges with white necks; Thundered on their oaken sides Angry force of mighty tides, And through shrieking rigging tore Fiercest gales that fled to shore. On to land the vessels sped, On to death the storm-wind led, Miles on miles of blackened cliffs Saw the helpless, feeble skiffs Swung from schooners' sides and then Oared by stout-armed fishermen, Shattered, broken at their feet: Heard mad waves the dirge repeat Of the men who met their doom Where the wildest surges boom When along stern Labrador Rides the storm-wind conqueror! WHAT'S THE SWEETEST NEWS IN SPRING? What's the sweetest news in spring That the blithesome swallows bring, When from southern lands they fly Through our cloudier northern sky After frosts and cold succumb? April's past and May has come! One may hear it in the hum Of the silly bees that seek Honey from the petals meek Of the violet and the daisy; See it in the curving, hazy, Vaporous line that marks a river Winding slow where rushes quiver; Feel it in the thrill that stirs All the Maytide's messengers. May is come and April's past! Joy of spring is here at last; One may hear it in the note Swelling from the bluebird's throat; See it in the rosy snow Heaped along the orchard row; Feel it in the odors stealing Forth from lily-banks revealing Mid green spears small waxen bells. Every sense the message tells May is come and April's past; Summer gladness ripens fast. April's past and May is come! Greening woods no more are dumb; Every tree is vocal now; Every winter-twisted bough Hides its scars with leaf or flower. Now is come the fairest hour Held in fee of all the year; Winds breathe low and skies are clear; Neither cold nor heat can smite; All sweet influences unite In the Maytide hour to make Earth seem sweeter for our sake. Who the winter's cold remembers Or believes in drear Novembers When of joy this is the sum,â April's past and May has come? That's the sweetest news in spring Which the happy swallows bring. FRANCESCA AND PAOLO. In that dim-lighted land where bide The spirits who have sinned below, One newly come saw by her glide, In silence mournfully and slow, That other who upon her turned Sad eyes that alway swam in tears, And moved dry lips that constant burned With kisses never through the years Of dateless Ã¦ons to be kissed. Forever doomed the one to see Her loved Paolo near, and list In vain for loving words; to be Forever witness of his pain, And look and long for aye to ease The anguish of his heart. Sad twain! What lovers' torments like to these? WHERE ARE THE PIPES OF PAN? In these prosaic days Of politics and trade, When seldom Fancy lays Her touch on man or maid, The sounds are fled that strayed Along sweet streams that ran; Of song the world's afraid; Where are the Pipes of Pan? Within the busy maze Wherein our feet are stayed, There roam no gleesome fays Like those which once repaid His sight who first essayed The stream of song to span, Those spirits all are laid. Where are the Pipes of Pan? Dry now the poet's bays; Of song-robes disarrayed He hears not now the praise Which erst those won who played On pipes of rushes made, Before dull days began And love of song decayed. Where are the Pipes of Pan? Envoy. Prince, all our pleasures fade; Vain all the toils of man; And Fancy cries dismayed, âWhere are the Pipes of Pan?â SONG. If you love me, come and be In my heart of hearts and see How I think of naught but thee! If you hate me, tell me so, I should love you still, I know,â Hate to love will sometimes grow. If you neither love nor hate, For your grace I ne'er will wait; You will never be my fate! TO A FRIEND WHO DELAYS TO WRITE. Springtime goes, Comes the rose,â Ne'er a letter yet! Summer's reign O'er again,â Still he doth forget! Autumn fast Slideth past,â Can he mean to let Winter drear End the year,â End, and still forget? A VALENTINE. There is a little maid Of whom I'm much afraid. Shall I confess it? She wears a sealskin coat; Its grace and shape I note And needs must bless it. She wears a little bonnet: A bird that's perched upon it To fly seems ready. My heart, not over-bold, When her I do behold, Goes quite unsteady. She has a little muff In which, from breezes rough, Her hands find shelter. My wits, when her I see Clad all so daintily, Fly helter-skelter. Who is this little maid Of whom I'm so afraid? Dare I reveal it? This little maid is she Whose eyes these verses see; I can't conceal it. But if she should divine I'd be her valentine, As here I sing it, I'll dare to hope she may Be surely mine some day. Sweet skies, soon bring it. MIDSUMMER PASSES. With faltering step the sweet Midsummer paused Upon the last stair of the worn July. Behind her blushed the roses and before The scarlet poppies shimmered in the corn. From far-off woods a heated breath came past, Blown from dark cedars and tall groves of pine, Yet all its sweetness might not serve to soothe The bitterness of fair Midsummer's pain, Who felt her sceptre slipping from her grasp And saw one coming with his heated brows Girt round with wheatstraws, bold young August brown. FAIR FRIENDSHIP RAISED HIS PLACID MASK. Fair Friendship raised his placid mask and showed Beneath, not brows where calm Content should reign, Nor smiles wherein all-perfect Joy abode, But Discord's face, distort with many a pain! AN EASTER GRIEF. The Easter brightness fades away; A chill has numbed the bursting leaf; A shadow falls across the day And in our hearts is bitter grief. UNTO LATE AUTUMNTIDE. With lurid torch October fired the woods; Brief grew the days, and long and chill the nights; The birds flew southward and their songs made glad No more the hours. Then changed the maple's gold To russet brown. November's step was heard Along the leafstrewn ways, and, blown by winds And drenched by autumn rains, October fled Before her down the path where summer went: So waned the year to later autumntide. WITH A PRAYER-BOOK. In Common Prayer our hearts ascend To that white throne where angels bend. Now grant, O Lord, that those who call Themselves by Thy dear name may all Show forth Thy praise in lives that tend To noble purpose, lofty end, And unto us thy blessing lend As low upon our knees we fall. In Common Prayer. In this dear Book past ages blend Their voice with ours; we do commend Our souls, in doubt and sin held thrall, To His fond care, and cot and hall Alike to him petitions send In Common Prayer. ON TRURO SANDS. TO W. M. F. On Truro sands we walked, dear friend, Slow following up that low shore's trend. The crescent moon dipt in the sea, Soft darkness fell on you and me As on we wandered past the bend That marked the fishing hamlet's end, And felt the breeze against us spend Its gentle force. Ah, sweet to be On Truro sands! Some Presence did our steps attend And to that hour a blessing lend, So one in heart, my friend, were we, And set from selfish fancies free. How dull were life, that hour unkenned, On Truro sands! BEATEN. Where is the spirit of striving that once was so strong in my heart? And where is the lofty devotion that attended my steps at the start? I was so full of my purpose and never gave way to a doubt, Never looked forward to failure, whatever dark clouds were about, Always believed in hard fighting, and never once trusted to luck, Put my whole soul in my doing, and honest each blow that I struck. What is the guerdon of labor, of honesty what the reward? Only a pittance at most, and simplicity conquered by fraud. Where is the joy of believing when faith is met by a sneer? Why should we look to the future expecting the skies to be clear? Always the strongest are prospered: why may it not be so again, If there's a heaven hereafter reserved for the children of men? Might has the best of us here, and may it not be so beyond? I who am vanquished in battle have little to do but despond. Never for me will the prospect be brightened again by a hope; I have grown old in the conflict, and care not with evil to cope. Beaten am I in the struggle, the doom of the conquered is mine; Darkness and clouds are about me, the morrow I may not divine. Now I await the dread moment when I shall have done with it all, When the long strife shall be ended, and I turn my face to the wall. Sonnets. How oft the sonnet's fourteen lines Fail to convey the bardling's thought: The poet in that space enshrines Some theme with mighty meaning fraught. RECONCILIATION. As one who, wandering in a weary land Alone, where thorns and briers beset the way, And clouds and darkness have o'ercome the day, Suddenly feels from out the dark a hand In his, and hears a voice of mild command At which the clouds disperse, the sunshine gay Returns, and all within his heart is May As forth he goes unto some happy strand,â So I, in darkness groping, hear your voice Again, and feel your hand in mine, (For what is distance to true hearts that love?) And all my darkness ends, for at the sign Of your forgiveness I once more rejoice And feel sweet Peace descending like a dove. INDIFFERENCE. What is indifference, do you ask of me? O well I know the meaning of the phrase. It is to find grey ash instead of blaze That warmed you once; to lose, alas! the key Which turned in friendship's wards; to sometime see The eyes that shone for you in other days Now coldly meet your own in passing gaze; To know that what has been no more shall be. It is to find that you in naught believe, To know that youth has fled far down the past, To feel that hope will ne'er again be born, And love is but a poor worn cheat at last. It is all this, yet not for this to grieve,â To live, and heed not that one lives forlorn! EASTER-FRIDAY, 1883. [In memory of J. T. F., who entered into rest on Friday in Easter-Week, 1882.] O year gone down into the sullen past, Relentless year that hast no tidings brought Of him who suddenly from earth was caught And lifted higher while our tears fell fast; Thou canst not triumph over us at last, Because thy silence so with grief is fraught That joy is weighted with a mournful thought When at this Easter eyes are backward cast; For, past all doubting, well each heart doth know, Howe'er it fare with us whose heavy load Each moment lends its petty might to swell, With him no longer sorrow makes abode, But peace and rest abide, and never go; And with his noble soul it now is well! TO JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL. What rarer, finer bliss than his who feels, While happy friends and neighbors press his hands, The warmth of handclasps given in other lands Still left upon his palms? Though o'er him steals The rapture of home-coming, on its heels Follows the joy of holding in the bands Of memory all the hours whose golden sands Were run with friends remote whom space conceals. Such bliss is thine, O poet, coming back After long absence from thy native shores: For, while all England saddens with farewells, Thine own dear land, expectant, opens doors Of welcome wide for thee on homeward track, And every voice the heartfelt greeting swells. TO ONE WHO HAS SUFFERED MUCH. I know, dear friend, your hours are drear and cold; I know your path is harsh with briers and flints; Yet in the darkest day come happy glints Of distant brightness underneath the fold Of blackest cloud, and ever to the bold The roughest road will show the faintest prints Of weary feet. Look up! When morning tints Are in the sky the night grows pale and old. The longest lane a sad world hath will turn At last, and, round the turning, mayhap, waits Some joy to greet you that shall fill your life With bliss past all belief. Not always stern The future, nearer seen. Sometimes the Fates Do smile, and Peace comes surely after strife. TO MODJESKA AS ROSALIND. When from the poet's brain fair Arden's glades Were peopled with the lightsome folk we know, A shade of discontent was seen to grow Upon his brow, as he through long decades In vision saw this loveliest of his maids By beardless boys enacted, and her show Of maiden grace obscured and hidden so In guise of youths half-won from boyish trades. Soon changed the vision, and through centuries far A group of women fair he then did see, Whose hearts, one after other, were beguiled By some Orlando's youth and bravery, And in the throng, and radiant as a star, On thee, the mighty Master, looking, smiled! TO MODJESKA AS JULIA OF VERONA. The tender maid of old Verona's town, Whom Proteus loved and yet could lightly leave When sight of Silvia did his soul bereave Of friendship's dues and honor's fair renown, (More faithless he than many an untaught clown,) Has waited long for one who should conceive Her gentle nature best, and thus inweave All maiden graces in the woman's crown. Not until now has the interpreter Appeared. No other eyes than ours have seen Verona's constant Julia as she seemed. To thee was given the skill to plead in her The cause of hapless maids with fervor keen. Before of Julia we had merely dreamed! HIGH-WATER MARK. One glorious day gleams through my memory still, Though lagging years have come and gone erewhile; That day whereon I seemed to reconcile My aspirations with myself, to thrill With noblest ardor and to feel no chill Of low-born aim nor motive, nor the vile Persuasions of my baser self beguile My soul from resolution pure to ill. My soul may never mount so high again, And never may my sluggish spirit glow With feeling free as then from all alloy: But yet should this be bitter truth, the pain Is deadened when within my heart I know That I rose once and burned with highest joy!</field>
