      <field name="fulltext">LAUNCELOT AND GUENEVERE A POEM IN DRAMAS The following Schema and Commentary were included at the beginning of Volume V. SCHEMA AND COMMENTARY Written by Richard Hovey in 1898 SCHEMA. Launcelot and Guenevere: A Poem in Dramas. Part I.— The Quest of Merlin: a Masque. The Marriage of Guenevere: a Tragedy. The Birth of Galahad: a Romantic Drama.Part II.— Taliesin: a Masque. The Graal: a Tragedy. Astolat: an Idyllic Drama.Part III.— Fata Morgana: a Masque. Morte d'Arthur: a Tragedy. Avalon: a Harmonody. COMMENTARY. Note that each of the three parts is composed of (1) a Masque, i. e., a musical (operatic) interlude or prelude, foreshadowing the events to follow, dealing with the supernatural elements of the myth and symbolizing the philosophic, aesthetic and ethical elements of the series; (2) a Tragedy; and (3) a play ending with a partial (Parts I and II) or complete (Part II) reconciliation and solution. Launcelot and Guenevere are placed in a position where they must either sacrifice the existing order of things to themselves or themselves to the existing order of things. Part I.—They attempt to set their relation to each other above their relation to the world. Tragic issue. (Thesis.) Part II.—They attempt to set their relation to the world above their relation to each other. Equally tragic issue. (Antithesis.) Part III.—The reconciliation. (Synthesis.) Subordinate to this, as background: Part I deals with the growing power of the Round Table, the rise of Arthur, and culminates with Arthur's highest reach of empire. (Great event in the legends The Roman War.) Part II with the height (stationary) of the power of Arthur and the Round Table and the first mutterings of their impending fall. (Great event in the legends The Quest of the Graal.) Part III with the fall of Arthur and the Round Table. (Great event in the legends The Last War.) There is an interval of nearly twenty years between Parts I and II, and of five or six years between Parts II and III. But the dramas in each part are immediately successive. The Masques: The Quest of Merlin foreshadows the events of the whole poem, but particularly of Part I, i. e., the marriage of Arthur to Guenevere. Symbolically, it suggests the philosophical drift of the poem. Taliesin foreshadows the events of Part II (the Graal search, etc.). Symbolically, it suggests the aesthetic drift of the poem. Fata Morgana foreshadows the events of Part III (the treachery of Mordred, death of Arthur, etc.). Symbolically, it suggests the ethical drift of the poem. They might be called “the Masque of Fate and Evolution,” “the Masque of Art” and “the Masque of Evil” respectively. The Plays: Part I—Individual and sex relation (true family) set above Society or the State: (a) Marriage of Guenevere—(Love overthrowing friendship as well as more general social obligations); (b) Birth of Galahad—(Love still supreme, but seeking and partly finding a way to be loyal to friendship and the State, too. Part I, Tragic; (a) all tragic; (b) partly reconciliated. Part II—Society and the State set above the individual and sex relation or true family: (a) The Graal—(Love renounced; religion sought as means of renunciation. Failure of attempt.); (b) Astolat—(Gradual reconquest of love over religion, etc., etc.). Part II, Tragic; (a) all tragic; (b) partly reconciled. Part III—Reconciliation of Religion, State, Society, Family, and Individual: (a) Morte d'Arthur—(Essential conflict made objective and settled with the sword. Tragic solution of Death.); (b) Avalon—(True harmonic solution). Part III, Harmonic; (a) tragic; (b) completely harmonic or reconciled. I. THE QUEST OF MERLIN A MASQUE PERSONS. Merlin. Beneath Hecla. Urd The Norn. Verdande The Norn. Skuld The Norn.In Avalon. Argente. Nimue. Eight other Maidens. Sylphs. Gnomes. Naiads. Dryads. Pan. Bacchus. Fauns. Satyrs. Maenads and Bassarids. Mab. Puck. Oberon. Titania. Ariel. Fairies. Elves. Goblins. Aphrodite. The Loves. The Valkyrs. The Angels. Interior of a cavern in the bowels of the earth, beneath Mount Hecla. Huge rock-fragments, amid which twists tortuously a great root of the tree Yggdrasil. A flickering flame, by the light of which are seen the Norns, colossal but shadowy shapes, about a gigantic but indistinct Loom. Dull, heavy sounds, out of which arises a strange music, which resolves itself continually into imperfect harmonies, which leave the heart in unrest. A sense of striving and struggle beats through the music. The Norns. We are the Recorders! We are the Finishers! Nothing we initiate; All things we fulfil. Odin initiates And Freyja and Loki, Divine Balder and the other Immortals. Whatsoever they begin, Relentlessly we fulfil. Ye, too, O men, are as gods; Ye are free and the free create; Ye have part in the Imperishable. Ever as ye follow the Beautiful, Shall the worm transfigure itself And the new-born god appear. But over your destinies we sit in doom; Whatsoever ye begin, Relentlessly we fulfil. Think and we seize the thought; Act and the deed once done Sinks into our iron hands. Only the unthought thought, O man, Is thine own and the deed forborne. Thou canst neither love nor doubt But the doubt and the love alike Pass into the infrangible weft of the world That we weave with inexorable fingers. We are the Queens of Time, And, while Time is, we endure. With the calm of the Empyrean We mix not, neither dwell we therein; But over the shifting Our shuttles are inflexible. God having given us Time, Over Time we are greater than God. We are the Finishers. [A low, foreboding roll of thunder.—Merlin appears on a jutting crag in the cave, with a forked wand in his hand.—The flame flashes into sudden brilliancy, sharply defining the rocky walls of the cavern, but at once sinks back into its former weak and flickering indistinctness.—The Norns remain motionless, noting none of these things, nor do they actually perceive Merlin at any time.] Merlin. Hail! Ye monstrous Glooms! Formless Forms! Known and Unknown! To what avail Through strifes and storms, Athwart the Sea that bellows and booms In the ear With the threatening of dire dooms, Strove I once alone In the starless vast of the night of fear, Dread Queens, to behold your throne? Lo, all that passes From your touch takes shape, Yet in you I find not any shape at all. Dimly the dusk glasses To the view Shadows that fall Into the Void; the Verities escape. Without you seeing is not nor thought, But you— Woe! I discern you not. Urd. Sisters, how should a man's eyes see the Void? Verdande. Shadows of clouds he scans on a searchless sea. Skuld. Between two Deeps a film of mist that shifts! Merlin. Shadowy ones! Ye whom my eyes have seemed to see Many times in the weary years! Deeper and darker the riddle appears; Muddier the river runs. What are ye, Darknesses? Whence have ye risen? Are ye or seem ye? What is it to seem or to be? With the same awe I re-behold you As when I first clave o'er the unroadwayed sea And through the cavernous darks of Hecla's womb The way to Odin's tomb— To your earth-bound prison. Verdande. The shuttle flies. The noise of men far off Breaks faintly on our ears like distant surf. Merlin. Prison, I call it, I hold you— You, the Resistless, Monarchs of Days— As verily slaves as we. Slaves of the stone sceptre your own hands wield Over the weirds of the world— Or of some mightier Silence whose ways I find not without me revealed Nor within me enfurled. Urd. I hear a voice above the noise of men, Like a bird's thin shriek shrilling o'er the surf. Merlin. Ever thus! I pass and return, But ye remain ever the same. I see the weft wax and the pale flame burn; I hear dark words and ominous: But never to me ye turn; Me ye call not by name. Skuld. The surf booms on, the billows break and cease, And the gull's cry dissolves into the wind. Merlin. Answer my thought! Ye have answered before,— So mightily wrought My strenuous lore. By the wand in my hand I command you to show All the veils may conceal, That it ails me to know. Man and wife, is it weal? Man and wife, is it woe? Ye see not the wand; Ye see not the mage: As two straws in your hand Are the fool and the sage. Ye know not I utter; Ye know not ye heed; But the words that ye mutter Shall answer my need. Speak! Verdande. Woe to the maiden, for her doom is dark! Skuld. Woe to the knight! His thread is stained with blood. Urd. Woe to the Prince! For a witless fault great woe! Merlin. Alas! for all mortals Sorrow sits waiting. Man, hesitating, Into the Future peers. From the dark portals Issue the Fears. Verdande. Weal for the lovers, after many days! Urd. Ay, but they first shall sail a bitter sea! Skuld. Weal for the King, but not till the kingdom pass! Merlin. Weal and woe! A dark saying! Yeaing and naying! How shall I know? Urd. The seer and the seeing and the seen— Are not these three things known and yet unknown? Verdande. To live is better far than not to live— Yea, and to live is worse than not to live. Skuld. The womb—the tomb—and each of these is all— And he that acts, is wise and is unwise. Merlin. A womb and a tomb! No more? Verdande. Who weds this woman hath a royal wife. Urd. Behold the man she loves, a king of men! Skuld. Each man must choose his wife and bide his lot. Merlin. She loves the Prince!— A queenly one!— Whom else should he wed? Who else should share his throne? Daughters of Time! ye speak and convince. I have chosen a way to tread. Urd. Marriage the calm gods give, a crown of life; Marriage we give, not they, a kissing curse. Merlin. A rhymeless Rune— Is and Is Not. Solve me the riddle! Is there no overword? Verdande. Darkness and light ring round the globe of things, And each pursues the other as it flies. Merlin. Know ye the wand? With the wand I compel you. Skuld. A Dragon slaying forever a deathless Queen! There is no wit in us to make this clear. Merlin. Not in you? Where then? In myself? [He strikes his own forehead with the wand.— A black formless mark appears on his brow. —He falls in a swoon.] The Norns. Over the Loom Brooding and bending, Weave we the ending, Self-decreed doom, A robe for repayment. Hands from the Nowhere Reach the threads here to us. Hands only appear to us. Knowing not the Living Ones, Weave we their raiment. He who beholds us, Seeing no others Timeless and Free, Knows us and knows us not— But finds not the Mothers. Into the void deeps, Blackness of Darkness Above and about him, Dizzily down Falls he forever. [As the Norns sing, the scene becomes more and more indistinct, until, at the last stanza, their words issue from utter darkness.—A confused sound, like a low rumbling. Then a clear tenor voice is heard singing: “Nonne anima plus est quam esca; et corpus plus quam vestimentum?”—A ray of light breaks through the darkness, and now the song of the Sylphs is heard. The light grows brighter, until, when the Sylphs cease singing, the scene is completely illuminated. —It is a grove, with a Greek temple in the background. Merlin lies, still in his swoon, upon the ground.—The Norns have disappeared, and beautiful figures, in classic drapery, pass in and out among the trees.] Sylphs. The fleet wind's footing Is light on the roses. Wherever he goes is The lilt of his luting, Sweet, sweet. The little green apples He sways and swings. The leaves are a-quiver, Touched by his wings. The cheek of the river Dimples and dapples,— Sweet, sweet. The light mist-wreathing Is drifted and thinned. The lark flies flinging His song on the wind. The wind with his singing Mingles its breathing,— Sweet, sweet. There is no one wisteth The way that it goeth. The wind bloweth Whither it listeth,— Sweet, sweet. Gnomes [beneath, unseen]. Ho, ho! Ho, ho! In the earth below, Like worms that coil In a slow turmoil, We huddle and struggle And delve and toil. Ho, ho! Ho, ho! Merrily O! Under the ground, Clogged and bound, We strive and strain To be rid of the chain, As a caged beast rages To roam again. Ho, ho! Ho, ho! For the brooks to flow! Hear ye us? Hark! We're at work in the dark, And in and out We burrow about Amid caves and graves With a song and shout— Ho, ho! Ho, ho! For the trees to grow! The old earth Hears our mirth As a thing astir In the womb of her, A boding of birth And a harbinger. Ho, ho! Ho, ho! For the flowers to blow! Naiads [in a stream in the background]. Maidenly strong With a joyous song, Very merry is the river as it ripples along. The vales are voicing A great rejoicing; Earth laughs with flowers as the sky with morn, For a child is born, For a child is born. Sing softly. From sky and earth Is the river's birth— O the gentle joy of the river's mirth! There is never a staying In all its playing— Waylaying and straying from morn to morn— For a child is born, For a child is born. Sing softly. Who knows—who knows Why the river flows? Coming and going—what comes and goes? There is no resting In all its hasting. What is it that ripples and leaps along With a glad, sweet song, With a ceaseless song? Sing softly. Angels [above, in a burst of sunlight]. Glory to God in the highest! Osanna! Osanna! Behold, His dwelling is the Sun And the glory thereof His open doors. He and the blue of heaven are one And the Sea's dædal-paven floors. He is the Beholden; With Him to be is to be seen; Without Him spring were never green Nor autumn golden; By Him the nerves of sight are stirred; Beside Him there is nought but Night; He uttereth His eternal word, “Let there be light,” and there is light. Glory to God in the highest! Osanna! Osanna! [The Angels disappear, soaring upward; the Naiads sink under the waters; and the Sylphs fade into the air.] Merlin [awakening]. Sweet goddess, raise thy veil! ... A dream, a dream! Methought that I was in the utter night. So black it was, sight was not, nay, nor thought— Only a sense of falling. Suddenly A great light shone about me and a form, As of a potent goddess, moved across The circle of my sight. Queen-like, she wore A threefold crown, and in her hand she kept A mirror wherein, wonderfully glassed, Meseemed I saw the mystery of things— Wried in a sort but rimmed about with wonder. And by her side there crawled a shackled slave That kissed the mirror. From her head there fell A veil that clad whatever form she bore In awful folds, so that I could not see If she were fair or foul. Yet from her gait A sound came singing, as it were the voice Of many dulcimers. Whereat I cried Aloud and woke... What vale is this? The leaves Show not the tiniest mote-fleck of decay. Each little grass-blade—ay, the very mushrooms, Perfect as in a poet's thought of them! My boyhood's dream of what the world might be! Ah me! I dream still. This is a sweet nothing— The phantasmagory of a thought-crazed brain. I am too old to cheat myself with dreams. I have dropped my plummet into the great deeps, But nowhere found I this. It is a dream... What eyes are those that peer between the leaves With laughter in their looking? Do I see Or do I dream I see brown beautiful arms And breasts half-hidden by the russet gown, A-shift like jack-a-lanterns in the trees? Dryads [half-seen in the trees]. See the queer old fellow With the moss-gray beard! His eyes are bleared And his skin is yellow. Prying and peering— Hist! hark! He can hardly see, For his eyes grow dark; And the voice of a tree Is too fine for his hearing. For him, when blossoms are blowing, No fruitage appears. Deaf are his ears To the music of growing. The leaf in the flower, The flower in the fruit, The fruit in the seed And the seed in the root! There is only the need Of the eye and the hour. Come and catch us, Grizzle! Why stand a-gaze? Take the sunshiny ways! Quit the fog and the drizzle! Break the split wand And be done with the magic! Know thyself truly, Half-silly, half-tragic! Only shown wholly To the Lover we stand. Merlin. Something is stirring in the leaves, but what My old eyes grow too misty to make out. I catch a sound of singing, but the words Escape me. Alas! the wisdom of the old Is like a miser's hoard—laid up with toil To lavish on a mistress—she being dead, The old man counts his useless treasure over, More joyless that it once had brought such joy. [Enter a rout of Fauns, crowned with ivy and vine leaves, and dancing and singing to the sound of their tambourines. As they sing, they make mops and mows at Merlin.] Fauns. Hear the crickets chirrup! Jolly little fellows! Summer's in the stirrup In his reds and yellows. The bumble-bee hangs over The honey-hearted clover— Lazy, drunken rover! Buzz! buzz! buzz! A Faun. Foxes in the poultry-yard, Making free with chickens! Crows in the cornfield, Pecking like the dickens! [Enter Pan and Satyrs, with Pan-pipes.] Pan. Pipe! pipe! For it's merry to live in the shade— To lunch on the hillside under the trees, To munch lush figs and oranges And crunch fat pig-nuts, lying at ease, Looking over the summer seas. Satyrs. Pipe! pipe! For it's merry to live in the shade! Fauns and Satyrs [softly, as Pan pipes]. Hist! list! While the great god Pan pipes sweetly. Whist! all whist! His fingers ripple featly Over the oaten keys— A noise as of many trees And of all sweet sounds together, Brooks that laugh in the intervales, Birds and bees in the dreaming dales, The cool breeze whispering low all-hails Over the sunlit heather In the sleepy summer weather. Hist! hist! [Pan sits by the river, surrounded by Satyrs. The Fauns gather about Merlin. The scene becomes cloudier.] Bassarids [without]. On the height to-night— Speed the news, speed the news! Sting and smite The wind with a tempest of shrill halloos!— When the lynx is abroad and the red moon shines Through the rents in the roof of the raftered pines, And the black clouds rise from the muttering east And the hot winds storm from the tremulous south, There shall be the pale foam of passionate faces a-surge With a sea-like iterant urge, Round the fire and the feast, And the red blood shall be smirched on the blood-red mouth. Halloo! Halloo! There's a feast afoot. The torrent howls like a hungry brute And the owls shriek—Tu-whoo! tu-whoo! Fauns [about Merlin]. Tickle his ear! Tickle his nose! Hey, old wrinkle-face, isn't it queer? Sneeze, now—sneeze—ah!—there she goes! [Enter Bassarids, with cymbals, noisily. As they sing, Bacchus appears in a car drawn by leopards. He is surrounded by Mænads, bearing beakers of wine.] Bassarids. Hark! the lean wolf yelps! And his eyes are red balls in the dark; And the whine of the she-bear's whelps Wails on the wind—hark! Hasten, Sun, to the dolphining west! Speed, black Night, from the hooded east! Bring to our nostrils the smell of the feast! Bring the locks unbound and the limbs released And the tigerish lover that bites the breast! The torn red flesh and the beakers of blood! And the riot and rush through the maddening wood! Hark! the wolf! U-lu-lo! U-lu-lo! Bacchus. Wine, ho! wine, ho! Set the goblets ringing! Clink, clink! clink, clink! Hail, the laughter-bringing! Wine that makes the blood beat fast And sets the senses tingling! How the world goes reeling past To the wine-cups jingling— Reeling, wheeling round about, In and out, to and fro!— The trees spin with us in our rout And leap as long ago—ho, ho! And leap as long ago They jigged it to Amphion's lyre— Wine and Song have one desire. Mænads. Wine, ho! Clink, clink! —The goblets chime. Wine, ho! Drink, drink! So we conquer time. Time lies drunk among the reeds, Sleeping off his evil deeds. Bacchus. Let the future brood and bode Let the past go spinning! Pluck the roses by the road, You'll find them worth the winning. Let the tipsy days go by, Take their gifts! Let them go! Laugh back at the laughing sky, And when the storm-winds blow—ho, ho! And when the storm-winds blow, Outdin the thunder-throated skies With tumult of your revelries! Mænads. Wine, ho! wine, ho! Through the veins a-laughing, Like a sparkle on the flow Of the upland brooks that go Seaward wavering—swift, slow! Wine, ho! wine, ho! The god pours out his life-blood so That madmen may be quaffing. [The Satyrs, Bassarids, and Fauns crowd about Bacchus and produce cups which they fill from his exhaustless wine-skins. The Fauns drag Merlin to the centre and crown him with vine-leaves. The Mænads caress him and ply him with wine.] Mænads. Come, old wherefore-seeker, Let the Fates go flying! See within the beaker Joy imprisoned lying, Like a sunbeam taken In a roguish eye! Drink! let life awaken And grave-mold wisdom die! Thought is gray and life is green— These are what men choose between. Full Chorus. Wine, ho! wine, ho! See it foam and flash—yeo-heigh! Wine, ho! wine, ho! Let the cymbals clash! The deep hill-gorges Buffet back our orgies. The heart throbs quicker, quicker, With a lightning-leap of mirth, As the madness of the liquor Turns the blood to flaming ichor And makes music of the earth. See the crags shake to and fro, Toppling to the lake below! Wine, ho! wine, ho! Yeo-heigh! merrily, merrily. A Faun. Thy lips are teasing to be kissed. A Mænad. Kiss me, then, but catch me first. A Satyr. Love dries up my throat like thirst. Let me clasp thee as I list! A Bassarid. The swift fire slays me. Satyr. Joy! she wavers. Another Faun. Leave us, goat-heels! She's for me. Bassarid. Fight it out! We like to see Battles for our favors. Fauns and Satyrs. The garments slipping in the dance Show here a breast and there a thigh. Bassarids. The wild beast glares in every glance. Mænads. There are shady coverts nigh. [Exeunt Fauns and Satyrs tumultuously, chasing Mænads and Bassarids. Bacchus, laughing, follows them leisurely in his car. Merlin attempts to follow, but falls tipsily. The scene lightens.] Pan. O river rippling at my feet Among the reeds and rushes! O leaves that lisp applause to greet The thrilling of the thrushes! Some prescience of the reedy life hushes the noisy stream, And whispering leaf to leaf, the listening bushes of bird-songs dream. [Exit Pan. Angels [above, unseen]. The Lord God is a God of the living. To the works of His word The Lord's heart is not chary of giving The life-blood of the Lord. Through the manifold forms of His moulding It streams, and its working is rife, Forever enfleshed and unfolding— Life, life! Though the beast rend his fellow asunder And the hawk on the slain lark feeds, He hath made them whose voice is the thunder And He knoweth His deeds. Without night were no dawn And day were not known to be day. But what eye understands? Who knoweth His way? Tiger and fawn Alike are the work of His hands. Yea, Darkness He maketh and Strife, Who is Light and Love; And Death hath He wrought, who is Life; And Change, who sits changeless above. But under the earth and the heaven The arms that uphold them abide, And Death shall be slain, say the Seven That stand by His side. [A pause. Enter Mab and Fairies.] Fairies. With the pallid lunar dawn Trip we forth from Avalon, And our mirth Ripples o'er the dreaming earth. Over hill and valley dancing Goes the tinkling of the beat Of our many-twinkling feet And the sound is as the glancing Of moonlight on the lake. Then when only watch-dogs wake, Though the gates be kept and barred, It goes hard But we mock both bars and keepers, And the sleepers Rouse not for the silvery din Of our noisy coming-in. Or in the glen, Far from the haunt of men, Where the solemn owls protest At our every light-heeled jest, Like the stupid-wits they are, With a hoot, There our mischief is afoot, And the twinkle of each star Laughs back at us from afar. [A dance of Fairies.] Mab. Quick, fairies, to the river and scoop up With shell-like hands a shower of watery pearls To sprinkle on this ancient tippler here. A Fairy. What see I here? Am I so beautiful? My Queen, look how the water glasses us. [The Fairies are absorbed in the contemplation of their reflection in the water. Enter Puck and Goblins; afterward Oberon, Titania, and the Elves.] Goblins. In the night, Guided by uncertain torches That affright Luck-belated travellers, We delight To pass beyond the porches Of the templed universe, To explore with midnight lore Secrets hidden from the sun— To seek the many in the one— Whether the elements be four Or more— How the rose blooms and grows, With what blood its petal glows— What meat doth it eat In the eyeless underground. Sure, some rare thing's to be found, If we could but fathom it. So we delve in doleful places For its traces, Where the dead lie inurned And the paint rots from fair faces, And the armor crumbles with rust, And the body is returned To its elemental dust. Puck. Ugk-gnn! Ugk-gnn! What a lugubrious chant! You're not a whit better than so many frogs That croak at eve in some o'ershadowed pool. Why, what a mumbling is here of churchyards! Bats' blood! We're in Avalon now. Be a little gayer. Surely, We haven't entirely forgotten to be merry. For my part, I have small taste for skulls, unless They be sawn across and mounted for drinking-cups. Give me a pumpkin every time, with holes For eyesockets and nostrils, and a candle To make you think the Devil himself is in it. [The Goblins have begun suddenly to dig in the ground. Out of it they produce a shining metal.] Goblins. Lo, here! Behold What the earth doth hold! Out of the clay A brightness we bring, Better than gold, To the air and the day. It is moonlight made A substantial thing— A splendor laid Under the dark mould, By witless gnomes in the days of old. [As the Goblins throw the metal up out of the earth, the Elves take it and build of it a bridge over the stream.] Elves. We travel with a little pack Of wonder-tools upon each back, As light as any feather; We have a happy, handy knack Of putting this and that together. We spin the film of gossamer The woodsman brushes from his face; We weave the cobweb's airy lace No gust can rend, a breath may stir; We raise the mushroom's gay pavilion, And duskier toadstools by the million; We contrive the chestnut-burrs, Craftiest artificers. One is nothing if another Be not by to make it more: Brother atom knows its brother: Two and two are more than four. Give us tools and give us stuff— We'll make contrivances enough. Puck. Bah! You play the sage detestably. Now, here's one, lying by this trunk, Proves his wisdom incontestably, Getting sapiently drunk. And in that condition, he perceives that marvellous structure you are so proud of, but as a thin line of light in the eastern sky, though it is already high noon. To the inspired vision of this bacchanalian wisdom here, everything is upside down, the trees gambol and pirouette, and the unintelligent ripples wink gravely and confidentially. He sees our heads where our heels are, and our heels where our heads are, our virtues as vices, and vice versa. Rogues true and heroes scurvy— So the world goes topsy-turvy. Titania. Mocker of the elfin tribes, Cease, Prithee, thy ungentle gibes. I will bring the man release. Mortal, who with weak sight still To discern the true art fain, I alone have will and skill To clear the cobwebs from the brain. Let the perfume of this flower, Stealing to the seat of sense, Free the spirit from their power By its holy influence. And yet I know that thou wilt spin Still subtler films when these be gone, To wrap the vacant vision in And dim the light of Avalon. Oberon. Where's Ariel? His wand shall change This structure that my elves have wrought, To something far beyond their thought, It is a miracle so strange. Puck. You never do a thing yourself. But some poor devil of an elf Is made through weary leagues to beat His wings or run on restless feet, While you lie dreaming in the wood, Lapped in inactive lassitude, Wrapped like Morgana in the mist— Sometimes I think you don't exist. Oberon. Whimsiest of the fairy brood, I cannot scold you if I would. But keep a rein on what you say; When I command, even you obey, Who more than all delight to shirk. I give the law, ye do the work. [Ariel has appeared on the bridge, which is completed.] Ariel. Far away I heard your call, Lord and master of us all. By your wishing I was caught In the shadow-land of thought, Where the midnight and the day Mingle in a twilight gray, Through which wander here and there Wondrous fantasies of air, Throngs of thewless Anakim, Cities half-discerned, and dim With a rosy veil of mist Spreading into amethyst. There that golden country lies, Sometimes seen of mortal eyes As a vision in the skies. Wretches in the desert straying See its silver fountains playing, Hasten forward to their slaying; For the hungry lion lies Couched beneath the brazen skies, And the vision faints and dies. And the simple sailor flees From the trancèd ships he sees, Glamour of diableries. But the graybeards smile and say, “Arthur's sister, Morgan Fay, Is in elfinland at play. Trust her not, for she entices Sagest wits with her devices. Lo, this is not what it seems.” —Yet it ne'er could haunt their dreams, If it did not somewhere stand On the firm unshifting land. Thence I come and thither go. Master, what you will I know, And I do your bidding—so! [He touches the bridge with his wand. It is transfigured and becomes the rainbow-bridge, Bifrost, reaching from earth to heaven. The entire fairy rout march up and out of sight, singing.] [Enter Aphrodite and the Loves.] Loves. Dædal-throned, imperishable Aphrodite! Child of Zeus, O thou of the many-colored Spirit, crafty-hearted, devising twofold, Slayer and saviour! Who shall praise thee? Who shall be found whose fingers Now may strike the Lesbian lute to greet thee When thou leav'st the Paphian myrtle-coverts, Yoking thy chariots Lesbos-ward to cleave the dissolving ether? Only inarticulate wild sea-voices Sound, O sea-born Love, where thy lost sweet singer Drifts with the sea-tides. Yet thy lips are sweet as of old with laughters, Time grows gray, but still in thy golden tresses, Sunlight lurks and loiters, thou Queen forever, Deathless and ageless! [The Valkyrs appear, descending Bifrost.] Valkyrs. Ho, for the harrying And havoc of battle! The crush of the conflict! The clashing of spears! Ho, for the hero! Many and mighty The foemen that meet him, A white-hot mass Of hammered metal! Weapon and warrior Welded in the war-forge! So they surround him, But he, heavy-handed, Hacking them dauntlessly, Does them to death. We from Valhalla Hasten and hover Over the war-valley, Heartening the heroes. Ho, for the strong man, Stout-hearted in strife, Overthrown but unthralled, Overborne but unbroken, Daring and doing, Mighty of will! Loves. What strange goddesses these, slender, with streaming hair, Clean-limbed, vigorous, tall, fair as the pine is fair? Lithe, strong, virginal forms treading with martial gait Down yon sevenfold arch, resolute, stern, elate? Lo, their helmets upcast splendors that stream to heaven, Seven lights from the bridge, up from the helmets seven! Conquest sleeps in their eyes, victory binds their brows, Strength lies still on their lips, waiting till wars arouse. Whence and why do they come, halting before our Queen? What have we for their wills, passionless and serene? Yet are they wondrous fair, fair in a sweet, strange wise, With the sunlight in their hair and the blue sky in their eyes. Valkyrs. Lo, the Goddess we seek! The Queen from the South! Lo, her delicate cheek! Her adorable mouth! Her eyes that are limpid with laughters, and sparkle as springs never dried by a drouth! O gentleness, bending With royal reserve! O queenliness blending With languors that swerve Down the sweep of the lines of imperial limbs, that, stately and splendid of curve, Rise poised like the calla, Superb in its grace! The gods in Valhalla, O Queen, are a-gaze With the rapture of rumors that reach them and rouse them to look on the light of thy face! Come, then, and o'er us Thy radiance throw! In the heart of our chorus Let love lie aglow, As the breath of the brief northern summer that wakens the May-flowers under the snow. Aphrodite. Maidens and gods and messengers of gods, I see you fair and goodly and made bright With flashing armor and with floating hair. Not otherwise of old I saw the queen, Hippolyta, whom yet for all her spears I made to follow where at first she fled, Compelling to rebellious loyalty, Subduing her proud will to Theseus' love, Even as the smiling of the sun subdues. For strength is good, but strength that knows not love Is as a random archer in the dark, And many shafts are shot whose flight is vain, And some work evil. Yet not this alone— Ye bring me gifts as I bring gifts to you. Love without will and might of the strong arm Is bitterness and ashes of dead fruit. Be my attendants, then; I need your spears. Loves and Valkyrs. Throw open your arms, O Valhalla! Cry out and rejoice! For she comes with the sunlit hair And the face divinely fair, And the brook-soft voice; And a whisper of lutes is heard, The rustle of unborn leaves in the air And the song of an unseen bird. Lift up your heads, O ye gates, And the Queen of Love shall come in, With the steel of the north in her hand And the heart of the south within; And the snow shall melt from the frozen land, And the summer leaves be green. Lift up your heads, O ye gates, And the Queen of Love shall come in! [Exeunt, singing, over the bridge Bifrost.] [Enter Argente and eight Maidens, crowned with wreaths and carrying garlands in their hands.] Maidens. Rosebuds and apple-blossoms! Fairer than they seem! In our hair and in our bosoms Lying in a dream! Living and dreaming— Visionless and mute— Underneath their simple seeming Lurketh flower and fruit. Denying and averring As yet they do not know— Only an unconscious stirring Where the thought shall grow. Dreams of joy and sweetness Fill each rosy leaf, And the yearning for completeness Is a dream of grief. Wise without intellection, Dreaming toward their fate, Perfect in their imperfection, Let them wait— Let them wait. Merlin. If that thou be a spirit, or a dream, Or but a wonder of sweet maidenhood, I know not. But, I pray thee, maid or dream Or spirit, be as gracious as thy looks. I am a man much worn with years and sorrows. Hither have I come I know not how, and where I am I know not. Guide me hence, I pray, —Or, since thou seemest attended as a queen, Bid one of these thy servants go with me And set my feet upon some way that leads To many-towered Camelot. There I dwell And serve King Arthur, counselling his reign. Argente. Thou sayest; I am a queen. But I reign not in the fashion that thou deemest; Neither are these servants, but my kinswomen, among whom I am crowned by love only, Service with service exchanging, their least with my most counted equal. One, not unknown to thee, Merlin, is near, the ninth of my maidens, And she, when she cometh, shall conduct thee whithersoever thou wilt. The way is Not long to the battlements of Camelot, though long from Camelot hither. Merlin. I know not how thou knowest my name, and yet With many marvels I am so distraught That I no longer gape at anything. Who art thou, lady, and what place is this? Argente. I am the Lady of the Lake, and this is the valley of Avalon. The violets of spring and the roses of summer and the fruitage of autumn Here burgeon together, and the North here mingles with the South and is lost in it As a lover is that lingers in the arms of his mistress till he swoons and is one with her. Once hitherto hast thou seen me, O Merlin, when Nimue the water-witch Sent thee with Arthur to the lake-shore, for a gift that should gain him his kingdom; And there clave through the sheen of the shield that the lake holds up to the heaven An arm for the boss of it that bare the great brand, Excalibur, and brandished it; And Arthur with a cry sprang down to the shore where a light skiff lay for his using And leaped to the oars, and the boat shot forward like the darting of a kingfisher, Swift-sent by the urge of his eagerness out into the serene fire-splendor, Till it stopped in the centre a-quiver as an arrow is that strikes in a target. Then from my hands he received it.—But lo, she comes—Nimue! [Enter Nimue.] Hail, sister! Nimue. Hail, my Queen! Merlin. What, the beautiful Nimue! Nimue. Welcome to Avalon, Master! Merlin. O lady, I should rather do Thee reverence. Alas, what kingship sits In these gray hairs? Master? The child treads firmlier Over rough ways; but I, the seer, am blind And grope and stumble like a man in the dark. Nimue. Ay, but if thou stumblest in paths where another would perish—! Blind? Rather say keen-eyed as the hunter that follows The fleet-foot goat on the mountain, till, lost in the cloud-mist, Sheer at his feet gulfs gaping, he stops in amazement, Dizzy and doubting—but another had never dared climb there. Merlin. Thy words are like a wood-brook in my ears. But, gentle lady, I am sick at heart: Increase of knowledge increaseth mysteries; And, knowing much, I know that I know nothing. Nimue. Yet something I hold it, being man, to put question as thou To the gods, though the gods render answer in riddles. Merlin. Ah, me! Too well I know the bridgeless vast between The most high gods and men. Let but these limbs Be once more lithe and tense, and so endure— These smouldering eyes flame with immortal fire— What do I say?—Make the soul young again To tread with step perennially light The ways of thought and passion, and o'erleap The hedges and the dykes of circumstance— There were the god-like!—then I might dare think ... Of what is less than a day-defeated dream. Nimue. Why breakest thou so suddenly off, too modest? Dreams are from God. So oft is an oracle spoken. Merlin. Thy words are as a lure to the fatal springe Of mine own folly. Nimue, Nimue! ... First time I saw thee, 't was in a frail skiff Among the water-lilies of the lake— Standing upright, borne on without wind or oar, As if the spirit of the flowers had risen Over them in a mist and, floating there, Rounded at last to definite shape—in thee. Since then at night I have seen thee by my bed And in the day—But I have not been a fool. Mere man am I and weak with years, nor choose, Leaping at godhood, to fall back to earth, Crippled and bleeding. Nimue. Manhood is godhood in germ— Aught less is brutishness. Anywise, whoso would win, Be it godhood or devilhood, must leap. Merlin. I have talked face to face With gods and demons, and have dared to seek The awful cavern of the Norns and held Strange questionings with them; yet none the less I know myself—mere man. Not mine to hope Youth and the goal, the joy of mastership, The poise of achievement—these are for the gods. Argente. Thou camest from Hecla hither? Merlin. Ay, but by some strange route I know not of. Nimue. Dark riddles speak they, the sullen-muttering Norns. Why wouldst thou scan their searchless mysteries? Argente. Concerning what didst thou demand of them? Merlin. Of Arthur and the maiden, Guenevere. Argente. Seeks Arthur, then, a queen? Merlin. He would be wed. Argente. Beware lest he find a queen, but not a wife! Let him not marry her, Merlin! Ah, woe! I see a great woe in the land. Merlin. Shall all his might be lost with which he strove, Building the mightiest throne in the round world, The noblest—for failure of a hand to keep His conquests? For a child is as ourselves, Renewed, corrected, wiser for our lives, Achieving wholly where we partly failed. Argente. With much devising we shall change no whit What God shall do with that which we have done. Merlin. What, shall our labors fail? Argente. The kingdom shall pass utterly. But he, the king, shall wear a greater crown. Merlin. Knowing all this, why questionest thou me? Argente. Yon world of days and nights where Arthur lives, I know but as thou knowest. Merlin. Over it they rule, The Norns, the unfaltering. Why keepest thou me here, then, With empty words? Argente. O weak in wisdom! Knowest thou not, then, that here Thou, too, wert born. Camelot? The world? A dream, Wherein thou movest about Amid thin apparitions! Nimue. Here, here, O Merlin, Delights await thee, Soft lips that smite and sweet hands that kiss, Love that decays not, Joy that delays not, Thought that grows thing Without groaning, a gladsome travailing. Merlin. O subtly fair and beautifully wise, With what device wouldst thou ensnare my mind? Argente. Understandest thou not? Thou, who art subtle beyond thought! Nimue. O slow of faith! Lo, I invite thee Out of the shadows To the firm and the free. Argente. I charge thee, as thou wouldst avert great woe, Let not the king take Guenevere to wife. Merlin. Wouldst thou be mightier than the Norns? Argente. Over the beginnings They have no power. Theirs but to conclude. Merlin. Who shall persuade their wills? Who shall unspeak their words? Argente. Even thou understandest not as yet their speech. Merlin. A brittle anchor is thought; But the storm bellows and ramps and the gods in heaven are earless. Weak as it is, I cast it out to the tide. Nimue. Yet are there winds that blow to a secure haven. Argente. Wilt thou trust the hope of the world to a slender cord? Merlin. Nay, what seems best to my divided soul, That must I do, let it be well or ill. Argente. Ai, ai! The fate of the king, the grandly-defeated! For over many ways he toils, with hope High-set, to find a darkness and a chasm. Merlin. What ill is this, whereof she prophesies? Argente. Woe, woe! The dream of the new earth Is broken and shattered. It drives before the wind As torn clouds after the spent storm. Merlin. What shall endure? For, although one should build Upon a rock, there is the earthquake. Ay, The earth itself shall be cast as straw in the fire, And there shall none know where in the trackless gulfs Of interstellar darkness, thundering, It charioted once its swift predestined way. Argente. Ah me! A blessed lot is the lily's in the lake, That waits the rounding of its circled life Without the sense of unfulfilled desire. Maidens. Comfort thee, O our Queen! The best is yet unseen. Even we, as the earth-born, See not the very end To which our footsteps tend, Through tears and mirth borne. This use may lie in sorrow,— To drive the soul to strive and strain, Building its vast and sunsetless to-morrow, To escape to-day's intolerable pain. If to all grief a sweet surcease were given, How should the spirit unfold to larger scope? Why should we strive for heaven, If earth fulfilled our hope? [Argente and the maidens have withdrawn a little space.] Merlin. O Nimue, had it been but possible, That thou an earthly maiden, I a lad, With nought to know or to forbode beyond The thoughts that stir the thrushes in the coverts—! O Age! what better boon hast thou to bring Than love and song? But Arthur waits for me, And what should I, an old man, have to do With dreams of a completion for myself Who daily weaken toward the undoing of all The half-wrought in me—death. Elsewhere I look To find the fruit grown ripe that fell in me, Blasted in flower-time. Arthur waits for us. Nimue. Be it so, then. I summon my ministers.—Ho! Arise, ye that turmoil beneath there!—Yet once again I shall pass from thy sight as the violet light on the sea When the sun sinks into a cloud.—Arise, ye starvelings!— But, oh, my master and lord! Thou shalt hear in the teasing of leaves stirred by the wind, In the lisp of the lake through the reeds and the swan's harsh cry, Made strangely, mournfully sweet in the cool and the dusk As it comes from afar o'er the waters, a message of me; For I wait for thee—there in the reeds! As a glen in the woodland waits, with the touch of the sun Slant-struck through the leaves on the brook and the grasses (a throstle A-lilt in the bush), till the man, world-weary, appearing, Worn with contention and evil, rests in her arms, And his fever is cooled and his limbs wax youthful and strong, And the sin is cleansed from his soul and the mist from his eyes, And the bird in his heart wakes, singing of love and peace.— Arise, I say, monsters! Arise! Earth waits and the carrion of earth! Hunger ye not? [The ground opens and flames appear. Through the opening a car rises, drawn by dragons. Nimue enters the car and extends her hand to Merlin who follows her. The car rises into the air and disappears in the distance.] Argente. With grinning jaws They gape horridly, Bearing him back where body and soul Gnaw juiceless bones continually. Jag-toothed dragons, shutting and opening your eyes With hideous slowness! In my soul, too, is a hunger. Ai, ai! The bite of the tooth in flesh that cannot waste! Maidens. Comfort thee, O our Queen! Sorrow is dear to the wise, Who know that Love is leading, And believe—for have they not seen? Mystery of mysteries! The crowned brow is bleeding. Argente. Alas, my sisters! you are good to me. Your presence is as starlight to my spirit. Your words are as a bird's song in the trees When all the woodland sorrows under clouds. I know the end is sweet—I see it plain, As the jay yonder the bough to which it flies. But oh, the way is long and the heart weak! Is the physician's wound less sore Because his cunning knows that it will heal? The fallen warrior With the broken shaft of the spear driven as a nail Through muscle, sinew, bone, lung, heart— Feels he not, though Valhalla open And the Valkyrs wait with cup and crown, Sharp anguish, intolerable gaspings that pierce Each with keen torture the frayed nerves, killing him A hundred times for once? Ai, ai! It is not all a good to see the things That shall be. He that will soar to topmost heaven, Must plunge, too, down to the voiceless lowest of hell. Ye shall not know the good without the evil, Saith the Lord God. Ai, ai! I see the maiden stand in the choir. The royal robes are girt upon her. Priests And choristers intone monotonously. The sunlight falling bloodily through the panes, Is dim and thick with incense. The King comes! I see him take her fatal hand in his. Aïe! The breath of the god Tingles on my forehead! My flesh quivers with its power! The dread that hung over me sunders as a cloud. A sunlit garden—lay this behind the gloom? And he—is he my fear? Beautiful as Balder he stands by the beautiful queen, High-thoughted, kingly as a cedar. From the high hills the woe cometh, A desolating avalanche!. ... The scabbard, Arthur! Quick! The intriguing fingers close on it. Awake! The sword itself is less precious. Ah! . . Woe! woe! The stark bodies of the slain!— Spare me, Spirit that overbroods me! I endure not the vision! I am slain with intense whirling of tumultuous life! Back, bodeful clouds! Once again, as with inrolling waters, Engulf the insufferable sight! Aïe! The din of shields and the shouts of the warriors! The death-birds hovering afar off!. ... Where is he, my king, my beloved? Over the sea-like sparkle of shields I seek him—in vain. Ah, ah! There, in the crest of the war-surf— Arthur, Arthur! He struggles toward the treacherous chief. Their swords clash. O valiant prince! O misbegotten traitor!. ... He falls—the King! the King! [She falls back exhausted and is surrounded by her maidens, screening her from sight.] Maidens. Comfort thee, O our Queen! Through warring and woe The man and the woman Build heaven for themselves. From the deeps where it delves Uplifted, the human Soars to the divine, Though the void intervene. Pierce through the veils and lo, The sevenfold light of the shrine! [Exeunt slowly, singing.] Angels [above.] Holy! holy! holy! Which wert and which art and which shalt be, World without end! Alleluia! In Thyself is the end And the cause of Thy being, O Thou beyond name! In the mystery of Thy seeing, The eye and the vision blend. 'Mid the shifting and fleeing Thou abidest the same. Death and birth Are the garment of Thee! The seed and the bud;— But ere these is the thought of a tree. Behold, the bread of the earth And the wine of the sea Are Thy body and blood. Love, which is light, Brings to earth the far sun. Love, which is life, Is as blood through Thy body to run. Love, which is spirit, shall smite Thought and thing into one, As a man and a wife. Holy! holy! holy! Which art in all and through all and beyond all! Alleluia! alleluiaa! alleluia! [The entire scene melts away into a glory of intense light, because of the brightness of which the flight of the Angels is seen but dimly as they pass through it.] Angels. Down, down! Into the gulfs of night Between the worlds! God also is there. Down, down! Into the caverns of space, Where the great dark winds fare From star to star! Leaving his light, Still towards him is our flight. There in the dragon dark's embrace, As here, as here, we look upon his face. [The light changes to darkness. Mid-aether. Merlin and Nimue, in the chariot of dragons, accompanied by the Angels. Nought else is seen in space but the distant stars.] Merlin. What flames are these? Lines of white following fire, Half human and half meteor! Their light Is as the swift aurora in the north. Angels. Dark, dark! Dark is noon to the blind. Follow and find! Follow and find! Hark, hark! The noise of a rushing wind! But thou knowest not whence it blows Nor whither it goes. Merlin. Torment me not, ye fair derisive glories! With much inquiring I lose heart to seek. Angels. Close the eyes of the mind And open the eyes of the soul! Seek no more By sea or sky or shore To overtake the Eternal nor unbind The irrevocable scroll. Seek and the sought eludes; Strive and the prize retires; Cities and solitudes, Night and the griffon woods, Passions and wild desires, And the far fires Of the immeasurable sky— What secret shall they tell The dividing eye? Death and a shell. Break Leviathan as a colt, And Behemoth as a foal; Put thy yoke on the thunderbolt, And use him for thy mirth; Curb and control The engirdled earth! Art thou nearer the goal? Put a bit in the teeth of the storm, And a noose on the neck of the sea; Say to ice, “Thou shalt keep me warm,” And to air, “Be a bridge for me;” What hast thou gained for thy toil But a vaster gulf for prayer? Thy bread and wine and oil, And still the darkness there? Thou shalt measure the stars; Orion and the Pleiades Shall send thee embassies; Thou shalt chart the cities of Mars; Thou shalt sift Aldebaran As gold dust in the pan; Algol shall undusk For thee his demon trouble; ... In vain! All is husk, To be cast out with the stubble. Great is the mind that wills And the law that fulfils; But greater the hour that sounds. Beyond all striving And slow contriving, Over the unrelaxing hold Of consequence and Time, That which was written from of old Confounds And subjugates to its own wilful tune Alike man's doubtful rune And the world's answering rhyme. Merlin. Alas, then, what avail the labor of man? And whither shall he turn, then, to be wise? Angels. Thou hast been with the Norns, with the Finishers; With the spirits of Avalon, the Origins. Hearken now to the voice of the void, The rumor of the dark, The wisdom of silence! There is a Fate that overthroweth the Finishers; There is a Will that is earlier than the Origins. Or ever the child is quick In the womb of its mother,— One for the battle's thick, Peace for another. Or ever the heart were stirred In the breast of the sire, Or ever his eyes were a word Of delight and desire, One for the scourge and scars, And one for a dull routine, And one to dazzle the stars And make Time his demesne. The lifting of a lid, The stirring of a breeze, In these The Destinies are hid. Why thou shouldst turn and look Thither to-day And not another way, Is a sealed book; But in that glance Slow life becomes a spirit-stirring dance. Before all things Listen for the beat of the unseen wings; Whither they lead, By hill or hollow. Palace or mead, There shalt thou follow. Whither they lure, Be not afraid; Thy path is waylayed, Ambushed with aid, To hesitance obscure, But to the dare secure; And the universe conspires With thy desires. So, when all plans are laid And laid in vain, So, though all debts be paid And paid again, In its own despite And in the teeth of right The soul shal be betrayed To its domain. And the kingdom of one is joy, And the kingdom of one is tears; One for a dull annoy, And one for a sea of cheers! Each to his own, Whatever the road he take; This one to sit on a throne, And that one to stand at the stake! Nimue. Hearken to them, O Merlin! Woman in me Makes my divinity bow and acknowledge their speech. Wise are the Norns, and wiser and earlier we; Truth spake the Norns, but truth is not one but three; Deeper and wiser the truth that these flame-fashioned teach. Merlin. Speak, ye; and I am silence and abased. Angels. What thou canst divine, That is thine, is thine. [Three forms, like unto the Angels, appear in space; and on the forehead of each gleams a star.] The Star of Arthur. I am the star Of Arthur, a meteor Of might and war. Under my influence armies spring Like grass along the trail of spring. Crowns and dominions in my hand, With heel upon the Snake I stand And, sweet and strong as death, I wear The hearts of all men in my hair. But ne'er shall he, the knight of peace, His world from wierd of war release Nor throne irrevocable his dream, (Save for the poet's lofty theme,) His high resolve for human good, World-empire of world-brotherhood. I bear no boon in my control Of face to face and soul to soul. His power is over nations placed; His fate for multitudes is traced. In closer joys and privier ties For him no weal nor safety lies. Friendship most faithful can but be A perilous infidelity; Marriage shall be a matter planned, Heart shall withhold to go with hand; Love shall awake to find its kiss A fatal and incestuous bliss; And at the end his life shall bleed Beneath the stroke of his own seed. The Star of Launcelot. I am the star of Launcelot. My splendor would be without blot But that one nobleness shall smite Another and make blessing blight. Whose life I am torch-bearer for, Supreme in love, supreme in war, No foe shall vanquish in the fray Nor ill hap snatch success away. Loves that he would not, come to woo; He has one love and that love true. And the whole world waits for his eye Its royal will to signify. But in his heart eternal jar, Two loves, two loyalties at war, Love without peer and peerless friend, And each by each debarred and banned, The joy of hearts a brand and thong, And truth to each the other's wrong. Yet in that bitter strife within As in the outer battle's din, Victor where'er his fate be cast, The triumph shall be his at last; Though far the port and fierce the gale, He shall prevail, he shall prevail; Dauntless in doubt and undismayed, Whom his own soul makes not afraid, Faltering between the dark and day, He shall not miss his dubious way, And though his seeming twist and bend, Shall keep his soul true to the end. The Star of Guenevere. I am the star of Guenevere, A regnant and a rebel sphere, A light to make the years grow dim And Time's eyes like a lover's swim, Heavened highest in the skies of song, And dowered with love's ancient wrong. She for whom burns my beacon-light, Shall have the wonder of the night For beauty, and for soul's desire The passion of the solar fire. A bitter crown shall be her fate; And yet her joy shall be more great. She shall be branded with men's blame, And for the glory wear the shame, Yet keep her spotless passion white Forever in all true men's sight. Though never far destruction threat, She shall elude its malice yet, Pass through all perils without scaith And pluck the beard of palsied death. The lordliest love-light of the years Is Guenevere's, is Guenevere's. Her sorrow shall be made a stair To enter Eden unaware; Her joy shall be a golden road Through woodlands of divine abode. She shall for every bruise have balm, Win through love's tempest to love's calm, Trample the dragon, world's-repute, Under her fair victorious foot, Make good love's cause for loves unborn, And leave a name beyond Time's scorn, That Love may shrine and Song revere The memory of Guenevere. [They vanish, suddenly, with the Angels.] Nimue. Thou, too, O Merlin, Follow thy star. Merlin. I follow thee. [The chariot passes from sight.] II. THE MARRIAGE OF GUENEVERE A TRAGEDY PERSONS.

Knights, Ladies, Ambassadors, Heralds, Pages, Watchmen, Attendants, etc. Scene.—Britain. Time.—May and June. ACT I. Scene I. —In the edge of a wood a cavalcade has dismounted and the horses are tethered among the trees. In the background Merlin sits alone on a high place, looking at the towers of Cameliard, which are seen hazily in the distance. A group of Knights, seated in the foreground under a large oak tree, have just ended their repast and the attendants bring them beakers of wine. In this group may be noted Sir Lionel, Sir Ector De Maris, Sir Bors De Ganys, and Sir Galahault. King Arthur and Sir Launcelot walk apart in private talk. Ector. Thou hast not loved, Sir Bors. Lionel. But I love, cousin— As fair a maid as e'er wore taffeta. By the Round Table, lords, I think no knight A truer lover! Yet hold I with my brother, Friendship is nobler. Ector. Were thy lady here, Thou durst not say it. Lionel. Why, who tells truth to women? They love us better for a soft deceit And feed on lies like sweetmeats. Ector. There are friends Who play the rogue too and are branded false. But false in love too often is a jest Or flaunts itself for virtue. Still my faith is That loyal love is the most goodly fruit That grows out of men's hearts. Bors. But loyal friendship, A fruit let fall by angels out of heaven, A thing to die for! Galahault. Ay, at need; but love A thing to live for—this is bitterer. Lionel. Call you life bitter? Galahault. Is the rind so sweet? I can conceive a man so weary of life That he would quaff mandragora to the drains As revellers drink wine. Do you conceive, His nearest friend beseeching, such a man Would forego his carouse? But if his love Came to him saying “Live, for I bid thee live,” Though life and love alike were bitterness, He would pour out the sweet death in the dust. Bors. Love seeks a guerdon; friendship is as God, Who gives and asks no payment. Galahault. Tut, ye are boys. Ye deem of love as children play at arms And wit not what a slain man is. Heard ye Never of Arcite and of Palamon That were good knights of old and as true friends As e'er faced death together? Yet one day, Seeing a fair lady in a garden close, They fell a-wrangling. Faith, they were as twins, Inseparate from the womb; and yet swift love, In less space than a man might look and say “Lo there!” hath sundered them. Bors. Look where the King And Launcelot walk together. Think you that they Would fall out for a girl? Galahault. Strange things ere now Have happened and the memory of men Outlived them. Yonder, dreaming in the sun, Behold the towers of Cameliard! Think you The King, for love of Launcelot, would yield The white enlacing arms of Guenevere, Who waits there for the splendor of his coming To make her Queen of Britain? Lionel. Launcelot would, If he were Arthur and Arthur Launcelot. And yet I think that Arthur's love is thin And substanceless to that which Launcelot Bears the mysterious Lady of the Hills Whom none have ever seen. Galahault. No fickle lover Can prove the glory and the might of love. The King has loved—and more than twice, I think. Lionel. Ay, he has been a gay dog in his day. Bors. He is the sun. If there be spots in him, I will not look upon them. Lionel. Nay, brother, God shield I speak ill of the King. No man This side of dotage loves him more than I. I spoke of trivial faults. What one of us, Unless it be yourself or Launcelot, Hath not the like to answer? Even the tale The common tongue hath of the Queen of Orkney— How is it more? They knew not of the bond That made their sin more than the heat of youth Might— Bors. Hush! it is half treason but to think What we give words to. Ector. Morgause, the Queen of Orkney! A strange dark woman! Galahault. But a beauteous one. [The Knights rise at the approach of the King.] Arthur. We almost touch our journey's end, my lords. Expected joy is like a maid that nears With coy delay and timorous advance, Eluding our stretched hands. So have I thought To-day would never reach us; yet it dawns. And ere the sun sets in the western sea, Your swords shall serve a Queen. Ector. Long live the Princess! Lionel. But not as princess long! Long live the Queen! A beaker to the bride! All. Long live the Queen! [Enter a Lady, attended by a Dwarf. She throws herself at the King's feet.] Lady. If ever you inclined your ear to sorrow, Be pitiful and hear me! Arthur. Pray you, rise. Lady. Nay, I will statue here until you grant My prayer. Arthur. You wrong yourself. What is your grief? Lady. Far back within the impenetrable hills The mighty Turquine dwells—of those fierce tribes Who yet acknowledge not our Saviour Christ But worship barbarous and obscure gods,— A wicked knave!—a cruel, treacherous villain!— One whose delight is chiefly to work wrong To all that call on Mary and her Son! This unbelieving dog in his foul lair With momentary tortures racks the bones Of my true lover. Me, as well, he seized And set his love on me—if that be love Which such a beast so names—and swore an oath To bind us each, if I received him not, And make my living lord the pillow to His savage purpose. But I, by God's help, Beguiled him and escaped; and with this weak But faithful servitor, through lidless nights And days that burned like fever in my brain, Lurked in the caverns of the hills and made The wild goats my companions.—Now, for thine oath's sake And in the name of all fair ladies wronged, O King, I cry you, do me right. Arthur. Now by My sword Excalibur, it were great shame Forever to all knighthood if thy plight Went unredressed. But I have that in hand To-day which more imports me than the wrongs Of all the world. To-day I take a wife. It were a great dishonor if the feast Were furnished and the bridegroom came not. Therefore Set on with us to Cameliard. To-morrow We will set forth with all our chivalry To hawk at this foul quarry. Lady. Oh, my lord, Think how each lapsing moment the quick groans Of my chained lover clamor for release. Wilt thou be like that recreant who said, “I have a wife and therefore cannot come,” When the Lord of Heaven bade him? Nay then, I see You are even as other men, whom I had thought To be almost divine. I know I come Unseasonably. Grief hath, my lord, a license To overpass the bounds of courtesy.— Oh, is there none in all this chivalry To piece his prayers to mine? Launcelot. My lord the King, I claim this quest. Go you to Cameliard And have no care at heart. I, with three others, Will seek and slay this Turquine, and set free His mangled captives. Lady. Thou and but three else? Launcelot. It is sufficient. Lady. Alas, you do not know The peril of the enterprise! Arthur. Fear not. It is Sir Launcelot of the Lake. He wonts not To fail of his pledged word.—My Launcelot, I had wished that you should be on my right hand; But since it may not be—Our Lady speed you! Launcelot. Amen. Fair joy be to your bridal, Arthur! Farewell!—Now who's with me? Lionel. I. Bors. I. Ector. And I. Lady. You are brave men. Come victory or defeat, I am bound to you forever. Launcelot. Nay, we do No more but our mere duties. Lead us on. I know the mountain paths of old. Armor And steeds would cumber us. We'll go afoot, Armed no more heavily than now we stand. Farewell, my liege! And farewell, gentlemen! We'll drink your healths ere long in Camelot. [Exeunt Launcelot, Bors, Ector, Lionel, the Lady, and the Dwarf.] Arthur. Ah, Galahault, with fifty men like that, I would shape this old world like a putty-ball.— Set on to Cameliard. [Enter a Messenger.] Messenger. My lord the King! King Mark of Cornwall has renounced his fealty And with a mighty army is encamped Upon your borders. Sir Godmar, the Lord Marshal, Has ta'en the field against him, but beseeches You haste to his relief. Arthur. Now, by my crown, I will not go. The heavens conspire to block My progress to the towers that hold my bride. But stood the Archangel Michael in the way, This marriage should not wait. We will go on; To-morrow morn is time enough for Mark. Sir Galahault, our Queen shall be your charge Until these wars are over. Come, set on! [While the cavalcade is preparing to move the scene closes.] Scene II. —A rocky pass in the mountains. Enter Launcelot, Bors, Lionel, Ector, the Lady, and the Dwarf. Launcelot. Let me rest here a moment. Nay, go on; I shall o'ertake you ere you gain the crest. Cousin, a word with you. [Exeunt all but Bors and Launcelot.] What blessed chance Has led me hither? Bors. Cousin, you called me back. Launcelot. Why, but to have you with me, Bors. This place Is like a sudden scene of other days That starts up in the middle of a dream; Bors. Have you been here ere now? Launcelot. Ay, and that time Would stand erect and vivid in my brain Though all the other puppets of the past Reeled into smoke. This is the very spot. I lay here, cousin, even here where this gaunt bramble Still tugs a meagre life out of the cleft Where it is rooted,—faint almost to death; For I had struggled through these cruel hills Three days without a crust, and my head swam And my legs wavered under me and would not Bear me upright. Down these precipitous crags And o'er these dizzy ledges I could pass No more than I could leap across yon gulf, And I lay down and thought of death, as of A gulf into whose blackness one might leap And fall forever. A long time lay I so, Too weak to struggle with impending doom, And death seemed like to yawn and swallow me. Bors. And yet you are not dead. How 'scaped you, then? Launcelot. God sent a blessed angel to my aid. There on the peak beyond the gulf I saw her, Standing against the sky, with garments blown, The mistress of the winds! An angel, said I? God was more kind, he sent a woman to me. Bors. The Lady of the Hills! Launcelot. Ay, so I call her, For other name I know not. Bors. The unknown lady, Whom you have made more famous than a queen! Here saw you her the first time? Launcelot. And the last time. She was attended by a motley Fool, Who stretched his hand and pointed where I lay. She saw me and in pity of my case Sent Master Dagonet—so the Fool was called But he nowise would tell the lady's name— To help me down the pass. But she went on Alone across the summits of the hills Like some grand free Diana of the North And passed out of my sight, as daylight fades Out of the western sky. But I no more Was faint, and went my way, considering. Bors. But could you nowise find out who she was? Launcelot. Nowise, for Merlin met me thereupon, And brought me suddenly to Camelot, Where I was knighted. I had fain delayed But boy-like shamed to say wherefore my heart Hung back toward the hills. And so I passed Away from her and never saw her more. Bors. Even here it was you saw her? Launcelot. Ay, even here. Bors. Why, then, should you not meet her here again? Launcelot. The hope of that is as the morning-star, The messenger of dawn. And in good sooth I have a feeling in my heart that soon My long and lightless service shall have end And I shall serve her seeing. But our friends Await us. I shall serve my lady better With noble actions than with idle dreams. [Exeunt.] Scene III. —Cameliard. The Palace of Leodegrance. A chamber hung with rich embroideries. At the centre a wide entrance with heavy curtains, which conceal a corridor. At the upper right corner a window opening on a balcony which overlooks the sea. Guenevere is seated before this window with a harp. Guenevere. [Sings]. The flower-born Blodueda, Great joy of love was hers; Now lonely is the life she leads Among the moonlit firs. The white enchantress, Arianrod, The daughter of King Don, Hath hidden in a secret place And borne a goodly son. But he shall have nor name nor arms Wherewith to get him fame, Unless his mother's heart relent And give him arms and name. Twice hath she cursed him from her heart— Twice and yet once again, That he shall never take a wife Of all the seed of men. Yet all unwitting she gave him arms, When the foe was in the land; And all unwitting a goodly name, Llew of the Steady Hand. And Gwydion, the son of Don, Hath wrought with mighty charms A mystery of maidenhood To lie within his arms. He took the blossoms of the oak And the blossoms of the broom And the blossoms of the meadow-sweet And fashioned her therefrom. Of all the maidens on the earth She was by far most fair, And the memory of the meadow-sweet Was odors in her hair. But she hath given her heart away To the stout lord of Penllyn, And he is slain by Cynvael's banks, Betrayed by all his kin. And oh, and she were light of heart Had they but slain her so! In likeness of a mournful owl, She grieves her nightly woe. The motherless Blodueda Shall never find release; From eve till morn she makes her moan Among the moonlit trees. [While Guenevere sings, Morgause has entered, unperceived.] Morgause. It is a sad song for a bride to sing. Guenevere. I did not know that anyone was near. Morgause. I did not mean to be an eavesdropper, But as I entered I was charmed to silence And could not break in on so sweet a sound Before the singer ceased. Guenevere. I thank you, madam; I am not in the mood for compliments to-day. Morgause. Not to-day of all days in the year, In which the sun shines on you as a bride? Fair weather weddings make fair weather lives. Guenevere. I care not much for omens. Morgause. Come, sweetheart, There is a time to mask and to unmask, And on a wedding morn the light of joy Should frolic on the face as in the heart. The courtiers will set up a silly tale That this alliance is against your will. Guenevere. But I do nothing, save of my free will; Let the vain gossips babble as they please. Morgause. I have just come from the Great Hall. You'll have A royal ritual, sweetheart,—such a retinue Of dames and damosels, barons and knights, As Cæsar's self could hardly muster in Imperial Rome. Guenevere. Is Peredure without? Morgause. Gods, hear this woman! I tell her of her wedding; She answers me—“Is Peredure without?” Ha, ha, ha, ha! Now what would Arthur say To find himself so hindward in your thoughts? Guenevere. Peredure is not like my other brothers, Wolf-eyed, thick-bearded, fond of dealing blows. There's something of the woman in his nature That makes his manliness a finer thing. He has the courage of a gentle heart— Morgause. And he writes the prettiest rhymes that ever were About some marvellous woman that he loves But whom he dare not woo. Poor boy, when he Is older, he will find the woman lives not Too virtuous to be flattered by a conquest. I left him in the throng about the throne With such a woful look upon his face, As if the rhymes of his last virelay Were all at loggerheads. Guenevere. Does he not go With us to Camelot? Morgause. 'T is so determined. I marvel that Sir Launcelot is not here. A month ago, ere I left Camelot To seek a friend where I must find a sister, It was supposed that Launcelot would be The chief of Arthur's groomsmen. Arthur and he Are like two almonds in a single shell That silly maids make matron wishes on. Guenevere. I had a strange dream yesternight. Methought An unknown knight stood by my bed, and as I lay spell-bound in dim bewilderment, Cried “I am Launcelot!”—and I awoke. Morgause. He came,then, in a dream. I thought he would not Be so discourteous as to keep away Entirely. Guenevere. Why talk ye all of Launcelot? His fame spreads westward over Wales like dawn. Morgause. He has the reputation of all virtue. Guenevere. And does his reputation top himself? Morgause. Sometimes a bonfire imitates the dawn. Guenevere. Sometimes, too, dawn is taken for a bonfire;— I care not. Dawn or bonfire, it is nothing To me. Morgause. Nor to me neither, but I chafe To hear the gabble that they make about him. Why, child, the world is gone mad at his heels! They tell of valor that despises odds, And courtesy that throws prudence to the drains— Such tales they tell of him! And as for women, There is not maid nor wife in Camelot Whose heart is not a spaniel at his feet. And yet they say he takes no fruit of it But is as spotless as Saint Dorothy— With such a tittle-tattle of his purity!— Bah, when the King and he are in one cry! Guenevere [rises]. What do you mean? Morgause. Oh, nothing—I mean nothing. Your husband is no worse than other men. The Lady Lionors has a little boy, But, though he certainly looks like the King— Guenevere. Why do you tell me this? Morgause. You must know some time What you had better learn from friends than foes. You are leaving now the world of fairy tales, Where all the men are true of heart and chaste And all the women chaste and true of heart. You enter now the world in which we live; You'll find it peopled in another fashion. Here comes a very wise philosopher— Ask him. [Enter Dagonet.] Guenevere. How now, sir? You look soberly. Dagonet. I? I am as merry as a skull, and that is always grinning, as you would see if you could but look beneath the skin. Guenevere. A grim jest, sirrah. Dagonet. Ay, it is ill jesting at a wedding. Aristophanes himself, who first wore motley, would go hang for lack of a laugh. For your good unctuous jest must have a soil of light hearts or it will not grow; and there is a predisposition at weddings to solemnity. Guenevere. Nay, now you are out; for a wedding is a joyous matter. Dagonet. But no laughing matter, my lady. For various wise philosophers have observed that in moments of most exquisite pleasure the expression of the face is solemn. What signifies a wedding? Harmony. Now the essence of a jest is contradiction, but that comes after the wedding. So no more jests from me, my lady, till you have done with eating green cheese, which is excellent diet for the moonstruck—but I prefer Stilton. Morgause. Tell us, then, good Dagonet, what is the most pregnant occasion of jesting. Dagonet. A funeral, for the long faces of the company provoke the merry devil in the brain as inevitably as a Puritan calls out mockery from the reprobate. I have known an accidental rasp on a viol to set all the mourners—except the paid ones— in a titter. [Sings.] With ribald chalkings on his coat Sir Pompous struts the street, And wanton boys put walnut-shells On stately Tabby's feet. Ri fol de riddle rol. Guenevere. Make jests at my funeral, I prithee, Dagonet. Dagonet. Death himself is the greatest jester. He is the farce that follows all tragedies. For is it not supremely ridiculous that I myself, about whom to-day the universe revolves, may to-morrow be reduced to the level of Alexander or any common dead body? Morgause. Do you make yourself greater than Alexander, Fool? Dagonet. Ay, or any other corpse, for I am alive and “a dead lion”—But the worms have eaten that, too. But here come the King and Queen. I was sent to announce them, but these lofty matters have made me forget my duty. Philosophy will undo me yet. [Enter Leodegrance, Camalduna, Pyrideri, Merlin, Galahault, and Attendants.] Merlin. May Britain find its peace in you, my child. I have given my life to make a State. I found The Saxons ravaging our fields, our King The traitor Vortigern, within ourselves Each petty lord in arms against his neighbor, And man to man belligerent. But I Shall leave my country one, victorious, Organic and at peace. And in the top Of this great arch of empire you are set A keystone, that it may not fall, when Arthur And I take our supporting hands away. Your destiny is glorious, to be Mother of kings and mother of a realm. Guenevere. And mother of my people, sir, I trust. Galahault. The homage duty soon must pay my queen, Beauty compels beforehand to the woman. Guenevere. You use fair words at Camelot, my lord; Our mountain courtiers have a blunter speech. Merlin [to Morgause]. Still where the quarry is the falcons fly. Morgause. This riddle has no key. Why do you speak, If you desire not to be understood? Merlin. I wish and I wish not to be divined, And you divine me and divine me not. For you are not so subtle as you think Nor half so simple as you would be thought. [Returns to the King. Guenevere, Morgause, Galahault, and Dagonet walk apart and after a little go out upon the balcony.] Leodegrance. Why interchange you with the Queen of Orkney These hostile brows? Merlin. Though she be Arthur's sister, Near is too near, unless— Leodegrance. I understand you. Happy the man in whose own household lurks No secret enemy to undermine His purpose and his joy. But she will make No mischief here. My girl feels honor keenly And will not stoop to listen to intrigue. Merlin. I doubt it not. The very waywardness That rumor speaks of her, shows a great soul, That feels too prisoned even upon a throne. Camalduna. Indeed, she is not like a common girl, And I could never make her do as others. Leodegrance. Wild as the sea-mew, restless of restraint, She roams the jutting capes of Cameliard, Like some strange dweller of the mountain winds, Half kelpie and half woman. The highlander, Chasing the roe o'er cliff and chasm, has often Seen her lithe form rise from the treeless crag Like smoke from a hunter's fire, and crossed himself, Thinking he saw a creature not of earth. Merlin. I know her kind. It is a temperament That suffers and achieves. Camalduna. A little girl, She frighted the nurses more with her strange thoughts Than ever they her with bogles. I remember Her creeping from her bed once in midwinter To ask if moonbuds only bloomed at night That dead men, when they leave their graves to walk, Might have their flowers also like the living. Pryderi. As the young limbs enlarge, the bones will ache; Our oldwives call such ailments “growing pains.” What our young princess needs is that her thoughts Be drawn away from looking on herself. The duties and responsibilities That push us from our dreams and make us sane By contact with the solid stuff of life, These things a woman finds in household cares. The wife and mother has no time to break The wings of girlish thoughts with idle beating Against the bars of Fate. Our princess, too, Must bear the dignity of greater burdens, Which for a soul imperious is good fortune. Therefore, as a physician, who must watch Both mind and body as they interact, I have prescribed this marriage as a medicine. Leodegrance. This counsel of our wise and learned leech Inclined us much to urge on Guenevere A speedy yes to Arthur's suit. At first She was, indeed, rebellious to our wish And marriage thoughts were wormwood to her will. Nathless I was unwilling to assert My power as King and father to compel Her course; for still I find the easy yoke The popular. Yet, short of straight command, The Queen and Pryderi,—and I myself,— Have day and night reiterated words, Soliciting with cogent argument, Till she consented. She herself now chooses The man of all men I would have her lord. For I have not forgotten how King Arthur With Ban and Bors routed my enemies And with their triple armies saved my crown.— Go, call the princess hither. Yet in sooth, What should an old man say to a young maid? The Queen shall speak to her. Madam, we shall Withdraw and leave her to your tutelage. Guenevere. You called me, sire. Leodegrance. To say farewell, my child, Before I yield thee to thy bridegroom's arms. Our Lady Mary keep thee! Come, my lords. Merlin. I wish you greatness, lady. Morgause. And I goodness. Pryderi. I health and length of days. Galahault. I happiness. [Exeunt Leodegrance, Merlin, Pryderi, Morgause, and Galahault.] Dagonet. And I a light heart and an easy palfrey that the way may seem short to Camelot. [Sings.] Merrily canter on through life And joy shall be your store, But if you ride a trotting nag Your buttocks will be sore. Ri fol de riddle rol. [Exit.] Camalduna. So far, my daughter, you have walked your way, Self-willed, imperious, like a wanton child That will not let her parents hold her hand, Yet knows them near to save her if she fall. Now they will not be near, and you may find That freedom lays a weight upon our souls That often we would like to shift to others. I fear that counsel is poured out on you Like an effectless wind; yet hear my words. Take you no woman in your confidence, But seem to do so. Each has her own ends, And would betray you seventy times over, And yet, repulsed, her selfishness through pique May aggravate to active enmity. Speak freely, but say little. Do not strive Too far to outshine the ladies of the court In jewelled ornaments and regal garb; They'll hate you for it. Be profuse of favors; They cost you little and will buy you hearts. Yet do not play the braggart with your bounty— Scorn lies beneath too much magnificence— But always give as if the gifts were trifles To eyes that see to whom the gifts are given. All women are your natural enemies; Think your end gained if they refrain from hate, But seek your friends among the other sex. Men have no quarrel with your eminence; Your glory with their glory does not war, But each may gain some splendor from the other. Therefore, they may be faithful; but admit them Only to the antechamber of your thoughts, That their imagination may have scope To fashion a dream-Guenevere to serve. Not what we are but what men deem of us, Is the true prince. Be faithful to your husband, Yet not so servient as to jade his fondness. Let him be often foreign to your life That he may feel your lack and woo you over. Be not too common to him. Hold him off That you may bind him to you. For in him Your domination lies. See that he has No friend that is not yours, no counsellor Whose secret thoughts are not your interests. Be chaste as snow in heart as well as deed; One spark of love may light a fire to burn The edifice of your greatness to an ash. Nor be contented with the innocent fact But make your seeming lock the lips of slander. And yet you may have lovers if you will; The more the better, so you love not them. For till we yield we are our lovers' tyrants, But afterward their slaves. Remember this. Guenevere. Pray you, a little space alone, good mother. [Camalduna kisses Guenevere, and then goes out.] Why, what a thing is woman! She is brought Into the world unwelcome. The mother weeps That she has born a daughter to endure A woman's fate. The father knits his brows And mutters “Pish, 't is but a girl!” A boy The very hounds had bayed for with delight. Her childhood is a petty tyranny. Her brothers cross her; she must not resist,— Her father laughs to see the little men So masterful already. Even the mother Looks on her truculent sons with pride and bids Her yield, not thwart them—“You are but a girl.” A girl!—and must give way! She must be quiet, Demure—not have her freedom with the boys. While they are running on the battlements, Playing at war or at the chase, she sits Eating her heart out at embroidery frames Among old dames that chatter of a world Where women are put up as merchandise. —Oh, I have slipped away a thousand times Into the garden close and scaled the wall And fled from them to freedom and the hills. And I have passed the women in the fields, With stupid faces dulled by long constraint, Bowing their backs beneath the double burden Of labor and unkindness—all alike, Princess and peasant, bondslaves, by their sex! Ah, the gray crags up whose sheer precipices I have so often toiled, to throw myself Panting upon their crests at last and lie For whole long afternoons upon the hard Delicious rock in that sweet weariness That follows effort, with a silent joy In obstacles that I could overcome. They never called me girl, those mighty peaks! They knew no sex,—they took me to their hearts As if I were a boy. Oh, the wild thrill That tingled in the veins, when the strong winds Came howling like a pack of hungry wolves That make the wintry forests terrible Beneath the Norland moon! “Shriek on,” I cried, “Rave, howl, roar, bellow, till you split your throats! You cannot mar the pinnacled repose Of these huge mountain-tops. They are not women!” Why, what an idle rage is this! Am I The Guenevere those still grand mountains know? This is a bridal garment that I wear. I am another Guenevere, a thing— I know not what. I go to a new life. I have ordered a new pair of manacles. Arthur? As well Arthur as another— I care not. If I must, I must. To live The old life is no longer tolerable. [Enter Peredure.] My brother! You have come to see my gown. Is it not beautiful? And see, this diadem To show I— Peredure. Guenevere! How is it with you? Guenevere. Why, as it should be with a bride. It seems You ask strange questions, brother. I had thought I should be greeted with felicitations. They say, a maid upon her wedding morn Is timorous, fluttered, casts regretful eyes —Or so she fancies—on her maidenhood, And yet is glad withal. Seem I not so, My brother? Am I—? Peredure. All's not well with you. You seem as one that in a waking dream Does—what, she knows not—with mechanic limbs. My sister, dost thou act of thy free will? Guenevere. Who acts so? Life and custom close us in Between such granite walls of circumstance That, when we choose, it is not as we would But between courses where each likes us not. No, Peredure, it is not by constraint, Save of the iron skies, I meet my lot. I have not chosen it, but I accept it. Peredure. Think well. Once done, this cannot be undone. You love not Arthur. This is not the face Of one that hastens to her lover's arms. Think you that you will ever love him? Guenevere. Love? I have heard of it. Poets sing of it. It must be a strange thing, this love. Peredure. Alas, If thou shouldst learn what thing it is too late! Girl, knowest thou what marriage means? Oh, if When once the fatal ring is on thy finger, Thou shouldst encounter some one who should kindle Thy latent heart to flame. To be caressed When thou art cold—this is a bitter thing. But to be fondled by an unloved hand, When all the soul is in another's arms— That were a horror and a sacrilege. Guenevere. I shall not love. But sometime I must wed. It is the law for women that they marry; Else they endure a scorned inactive fate, Unwelcome hangers-on at others' tables. Besides, a girl's life is a cabined one; A married woman has a wider scope. She, too, is chained but with a longer tether; She moves in the great world, and by that craft God gives to creatures that have little strength, May leave her impress on it. As for Arthur, He is a very princely gentleman, One whom at least I never shall despise. Peredure. Men say he is the crown of chivalry, The pattern of the virtues of a knight. But should he cloud the clear sky of thy life, I ne'er should pardon him. Guenevere. My brother! Peredure. Dear, I fear that Arthur ne'er will know as I The gentleness of this imperious spirit. I have asked Morgause much— Guenevere. I hate that woman. Peredure. Oh, say not so, she is so fair! O sister, I did not think to tell thee of my sorrows At such a season. When I spoke of love And pleaded with thee to have fear of it, I had good reason for my earnestness. I know myself too well the hopeless woe Of love debarred, against which Fate is set. I love Morgause— Guenevere. Morgause? The Queen of Orkney? The wife of Lot? Peredure. Ay, Guenevere, even so— I love her. I would give my hopes of heaven To press my lips against that flower-like mouth And call her mine! Ay, I would die to feel Once on my cheek the swan-soft touch of hers! But I must make a dungeon of my heart To hide my love in like a malefactor,— Or like some hapless prisoner of state Who ne'er did wrong but must be shut from the sun For the realm's safety and in some dark cell Is numbered with the dead. Oh, think of this And do not build a prison for thyself From whose barred windows thou may'st sometime see Love beckoning to thee when thou canst not come! There is no sorrow like a love denied Nor any joy like love that has its will. Oh, keep thy feet unbound to follow Love When he shall come to lead thee to his rest! Keep thy hands free to take his proffered gifts, Thy heart unbound by barriers that prevent The joy he would, but for our blindness, bring To make a rapture and a song of life! Believe— Guenevere. You talk of songs and raptures! Go Back to your poetry, you child of dream! Life is to be supported, not enjoyed. Peredure. Oh, no! it is to be enjoyed. Why else Should God have made the world so beautiful? And yet for me the glory of the hills, The beauty of the sky's dissolving blue, And all the woven magic of the grass Have dulled their loveliness, and all their splendor Cannot arouse again the ancient thrill. There is a grayness over all the world. Love is not to be mocked at, Guenevere. Take heed! Look in thy heart, and be assured That thou hast read it rightly. If a doubt, If but the faint foreboding of a scruple Be there, delay, break off this rash— Guenevere. Too late! [The curtains at the centre are drawn apart, revealing a company of ladies in festal attire, with garlands, etc. A distant sound of chanting.] See where my bridesmaids wait with wreaths of roses To lead me to the altar and the prince. Peredure. Is it a triumph or a sacrifice? Guenevere. God knows! For me, I have chosen to go this course, And I will keep to it till the event Exit with bridesmaids.] Curtain. ACT II. Scene I. —Camelot. The gardens. Morgause, Peredure, Lionors, Gawaine, Dagonet, Kaye, and others. Morgause. The day is dull. Shall we have music? Kaye. Ay, A rousing song! Lionors. He's all for tavern catches Or martial strains of braggadocio. Dagonet. It is the finitude of his wit, whereof he has neither enough to be merry without drinking nor to be silent when drunk. Kaye. Drunk, varlet? Dagonet. If I called it a finer name, you would not follow me. Lionors. Nay, for that would be false manners. Would you have the nobleman follow the fool? Dagonet. No more than I would have the ass follow the driver. Let me but carry the whip and he shall take precedence as much as he will. Morgause. Peredure, is there not a madrigal Knocking against your heart to be let out? Our idleness feeds on the empty day As a chameleon on the air. Come, sing And give us richer nurture. Peredure. As you will. There is a story written in this book Of two young lovers in far Italy And how they dreamed away a summer noon Upon the Arno. Reading this but now, I fell a-dreaming, I was in the boat, And round my neck her wondrous arms were thrown— And then, I scarce know how, the song was made. [Sings.] Love me! I care not for this one brief hour If blue calm smile or tempest lower Above me. I care not though the boat sink now If only thou Wilt love me. Kiss! Ah sweet, what joy in fame or years Or yellow gold? Life burns through tears For this. Ah, what though God should cast away The world to-day! Kiss! Gawaine. A silly song! That's not the way to love. Morgause. What do you know of love, Gawaine? Gawaine. Enough To know that it is a silly song, my mother. Morgause. Are you but sixteen and know love already? [Enter Publius and Ladinas.] The age has grown so forward that our children Will make us grandams ere our heads are gray.— You join us late, Sir Ladinas. Ladinas. Royal Orkney, The courtesy of Camelot to a guest Must be my plea. Lord Publius comes from Rome With weighty missives from the Emperor. While he awaits the King's return from Cornwall, He must not sigh for the Campagna. Morgause. Welcome. Will you make one of our too idle party? We have been merry with inconsequences, Tossing our empty fancies back and forth Like shuttlecocks, for wantonness. I fear You are too serious for these bagatelles. Publius. Let me not spoil your entertainment, madam. So many fair young faces are about me, Such a spring-burst of beauty and of youth, I shall grow young myself for sympathy. Gawaine [apart to Lionors]. What an old flub! [Aloud.] Now, madam, if you like, I'll sing a song I learned the other day And wager twenty pounds against a shilling Mine is the better love-song of the two. Morgause. What say you, ladies? Shall this fledgling sing? Lionors. I am sure he will sing well. Gawaine [apart to Lionors]. I'll pay that speech With twenty kisses for a word to-night. [Sings. Morgause, Publius, and Ladinas converse apart earnestly.] It was a sonsie shepherd lass So early in the morning That tripped across the dewy grass And tossed her curls for scorning. But ere she passed the brook, she cast A look across her shoulder That made the pitapats come fast And yet my heart grew bolder. A look, a smile, a jest, a sigh, A kiss and, ere we're madder, A glance to see that no one's nigh— And this is Cupid's ladder. Lionors. Oh, fie! it is a jade's song. Naughty boy, You must be good or you'll be sent to bed. Dagonet [to Peredure]. She cries “boy” too loudly. Oh, la la! Ostriches, ostriches! Morgause. Come, let's to tennis. [To Peredure.] Will you play with me? Dagonet [aside]. Ay, that he will, and lose the game too, for all your faults. [Some play and the others gather about as spectators.] Ladinas [to Publius]. What think you? Have I not achieved an ally of great price? Publius. It is well done. And no one of the court Suspects you are Rome's secret emissary? Ladinas. Suspect a Knight of the Round Table? They would As soon suspect the blessed angels. Publius. Yet There was a Lucifer— Ladinas. No more of that! I do not mean to sell my contraband For barren rank or tinsel decorations. I am no barbarous chieftain of the Zaire To trade my ivory for a string of beads. I must have money; you must make me rich Beyond the power of prodigality To dissipate—rich, rich; the rest is toys For babes to play with! Publius. You shall have your will. But say what motive pricks the Queen of Orkney? Ladinas. She hates the King as none can hate but they Who once have loved. It is the tale that ere The mystery of Arthur's parentage Was by his mother's oath made clear, he fought With Lot of Orkney and defeated him. Then came this queen, Morgause, the wife of Lot, And Arthur's sister, but they knew it not; And Arthur was enamoured, nor was she Unwilling. And, indeed, men say a child Was born and hidden somewhere in the hills, And that by him his father shall be slain. And others say the King is free from stain,— None knows. But't is most certain that they loved; And still the Queen of Orkney will not think That Arthur is her brother, but believes That for the crown he cast her love away. Judge how she hates him. Publius. And you love this woman? Ladinas. Ay, as the lost knight in the hollow hill Loves Venus!. ... See you the fair lady yonder, Who leads the stripling prince, Gawaine, at heel Like a pet greyhound? Publius. Well, and what of her? Ladinas. Her name is Lionors, and of old time She was the mistress of the King; but now The Queen of Orkney keeps her in her train That she may flaunt in Guenevere's proud face Her bridegroom's old adulteries. Morgause. Love game! It is the set, my lord. [A trumpet without.] Publius. Is it a herald of the King's return? Ladinas. He will not come so soon. We shall have time To spread a snare that he cannot escape, Though how is all uncertain yet. [Enter Galahault.] Galahault. Good news! Ladies, glad news! Sir Launcelot is returned. Several. What say you? Launcelot? Galahault. Launcelot and his kinsmen, Lionel and Ector and the good Sir Bors. [Enter Launcelot and Bors.] Morgause. All honor to the realm's pre-eminent knight, Returned, I doubt not, from a glorious quest! Honor and welcome to the good Sir Bors! Launcelot. Thanks, gentle lady. Joy be with you all! Where is the King? Dagonet. Welcome to Camelot— To my new capital of Foolery! Launcelot. What, Dagonet! [Aside.] The Fool! Where is the lady? Dagonet. You have too good a memory, sir, for a man of place. But, indeed, I knew not it was you when I saved you. Nathless, without me you had not done these great deeds; ergo, you must have done them with me. Now see what it is to be modest; I had no idea I was a man of this mettle. Morgause [aside]. What's this? What's this? Launcelot. Now, by my sword, I am Right glad to see your merry face again. Where is the King? Dagonet. Why, I am king now and these are my subjects. See you not how, like good courtiers, they mimic me? Kaye. How do we mimic you, sirrah? Dagonet. Marry, by making fools of yourselves. Ladinas. The King, sir, is in Cornwall at the wars. Launcelot. I am right sorry that he is not here, For since I set my face toward Camelot, For joy that I should see him I have been Light-hearted as a boy. I would clasp hands And wish him happiness with his young bride! The rumor of her beauty has gone out From end to end of Britain. I have heard She moves among our gardens like a dream Of empired loveliness in far Cathay. Lead me to her, Sir Galahault. I must Do homage to my queen. Ah, gentle lady— She shall not find in Camelot, I swear, A heart more leal to her than Launcelot's. Henceforth I'll wear no colors in the lists But those of Arthur's bride. [Enter Guenevere and Ladies. She stops in the centre, looking at Launcelot.] Dear Galahault, 'T is my first duty both to king and friend To lay my good sword at his lady's feet. Lead me to her— Bors! Galahault! Is it—? It is— Galahault. The Queen! Launcelot. I shall be leal to her indeed. Just God! [He recovers himself. As he steps forward with Galahault toward the Queen the scene closes.] Scene II. —The Apartments of Galahault. Enter Launcelot, Galahault, and Bors. Bors. Prithee, Galahault, a stoup of wine! I have the dust of seven kingdoms in my throat. Galahault. Some wine, ho! Bors. What, Launcelot, not a word? I have not seen thee so cast down since Ector was taken captive by that rude infidel, Sir Turquine, whom thou slew'st. [Enter a Servant with wine.] What, man, gladden thy heart with this. [Drinks.] Launcelot. I think that wine will never be aught but bitter to me again, and that I shall hate the perfume of flowers and the melody of lutes and mandolins as long as I live. Oh, my friends, I am but the husk of what I was, and all that was savory in me is consumed. [Exit Servant with cups, etc.] Bors. Thou'st not been thyself since we were presented to the Queen. I mind me now how thou didst start then and heave thy sides, as if thou 'dst seen a spirit. What—Galahault—is 't possible? Galahault. O Bors, Bors, Bors, the maids of Camelot Say rightly that thou hast not loved; for else His sorrow were no riddle. Bors. Nay, to me A riddle darker with increasing light. What, is the Lady of the Hills forgot? Have human hearts no stronger faith? For I Had looked to thee, O cousin, as the type Of faith. Wilt thou betray the King, thy friend, Even in thought? Launcelot. Peace, peace! What ails that I Should e'er be false to Arthur? Rest you safe, I have no lady if it be not she Whom I have called the Lady of the Hills. Bors. Nay, cousin, use me frankly. Launcelot. Betray the King? Thou talkest of thou knowest not what. Is 't possible That I betray the King? Bors. What name was it You gave the jester that we met below? Galahault. What, here? His name is Dagonet. The Queen Brought him with her from Cameliard. Bors. The Queen? Dagonet? By heaven, it is as clear as noon. This is the very Fool that saved his life For he did call him Dagonet that day He told the story to me. And the Queen, The Queen herself's the Lady of the Hills.— Thou lovest her. Launcelot. Ay, as the lost love heaven! Bors. Alas, I pity thee; thy stars are evil. But thou art noble and wilt not forget Thy triple duty, God, the King, thy friend. Launcelot. Duty? The word is colder than the moon. Thou art an icy counsellor. Dost think That love will, like a hound that licks my hand, Down at my bidding? Nay, thou hast not loved, Nor dost not know that when Love enters in, He enters as a master, not a slave. Galahault. True, Launcelot, Love is tameless as wild beasts. Chains for his limbs but leave his spirit more free To think the thing it may not act. Hunger Is his best nourishment and he grows apace Upon starvation. If he die at all, He dies of surfeit, not of abstinence. Bors. But shall our champion of an hundred fights, Whose name is one with valor's, be o'erthrown By an effeminate longing, like a girl? Galahault. Speak not in scorn of love, Sir Bors. There are But two things under heaven unconquerable And certain, Love and Death. [Enter a Page.] Page [to Launcelot]. My lord, your brothers Have sent to seek you. Launcelot. Good, my cousin Bors, Go thou for me; I cannot see them now;— I have no heart. Bors. Go, tell them I come quickly. [Exit Page.] You will be your great self and turn this love, If it be true that't will not be cast out, To something high and noble. It may be, As I can hardly think but that you live Under some special warrant, that God means You should do great deeds in your lady's name, And in the chronicles of Time be set For an example to the yet unborn How love may cast out love's disloyalties, And lovers, marvelling at such sacrifice, Shall say, “So loved the good knight Launcelot.” [Exit.] Launcelot. “The traitor Launcelot!” for I hear them now,— Cold, scornful voices of futurity That speak so cruel-calmly of the dead! Oh, Galahault, for love of my good name Pluck out your sword and kill me, for I see Whate'er I do, it will be violence— To soul or body, others or myself. You will not? It would be a kindly deed. —And yet I saw her first. What right had he To steal her from me? I have served her well Two years, laid all my laurels at her feet, Won all my victories in her sweet name, Though yet I knew it not. What right had he—? Nay, nay, she loves him—who could love him not?— And I shall hate him, hate my dearest friend, Because—oh, God! oh, God! Galahault. Why grieve so soon? You know not yet if she denies your love. What if she should not? Launcelot. Galahault! You make My poor head dizzy with quick-coming hopes. What!—you mean?—it cannot be— Galahault. Why not? She does not love the King; of that I am certain. Sure, you are worth the love of any woman, Were she ten times a queen! Launcelot. She does not love him? Are you sure, sir? Are you sure? I dare not hope it. Galahault. She is as virgin of the thought of love As winter is of flowers. Launcelot. But he loves her; And it would rive his heart. He is my friend,— Think, Galahault, my friend! Galahault. Love knows no friend Nor foe save friends and foes to his desire. Seek not to palter with him, for he is More tyrannous than Nero in his cups. He will endure no bargains, so much love And so much virtue. You must yield him all Or he'll not grant you anything. What profits The King if for his sake you let all slip? Why, that were chivalry run mad, for though She love not you, she ne'er will love the King. Seek other rivals, for not all the charms Of Merlin and the Lady of the Lake Would now avail to quicken in her lone heart A pulse of love for Arthur. Did she hate him, That might turn love; but when a husband seems A mere indifferent covenanted thing, She's like to love the Devil sooner. And can You calmly think that even your friend of friends, Lacking her heart, should call her body his, Should sting that throat with kisses and—? Launcelot. Damnation! Her body? Galahault. Ay, I said so. Launcelot. Not if he Were fifty friends or fifty hundred kings! Galahault. Why, now you are a lover. Come with me. The Queen is in the orchard. Launcelot. Galahault! Galahault. Look through the casement here. See where she walks, As if a rose grew on a lily's stem, So blending passionate life and stately mien. How like a lioness she steps and pauses, With grand, slow-moving eyes— Launcelot. No more! no more! [Exeunt.] Scene III. —A Bower in the Gardens. Guenevere and Ladies. Guenevere. You may withdraw, ladies. [Exeunt Ladies.] They did him wrong Who called him but the goodliest of men, For he is like a god. What did she say? “There is not maid nor wife in Camelot Whose heart is not a spaniel at his feet.” Oh, I should hate them if they loved him not, And hate them that they love him. What if he hide Unworth behind that fair exterior! And shall he add me to his list of slaves? Yet, though I hate myself that am so cheap, And love myself that he should be so dear, And am a thousand things at once, each eyewink In arms against its neighbor—what should I do, If he—? I am too poor a thing to live, And yet so happy that I am so poor! And yet so wretched that I am so happy! Why, had he laughed into my startled eyes And asked “Dost thou adore me?” I had lacked Power to keep back the “Yes” within my soul. Or had he clutched my wrist and pulled me to him And bade me love him, there before them all, I would have put my lips up for a kiss. ... Yonder he comes. Why should he seek me out? I am nought to him, one of a thousand women Whose lives have crossed his somewhere and then passed Into the dark. His Queen—a stupid word! His Queen, when he may hear the lightest wish Some other utters, as a Queen's command? No Queen at all, unless his Queen in all! I will not love—and he shall never know. I would I had not sent my maids away. I lie; I am glad they are not here. I felt That he was coming when I bade them go. [Enter Launcelot.] Does he do reverence to the Queen or me?— Good-morrow, sir. You like our gardens, too. 'T is a sweet place; June lays her heart bare here And sighs her soul out through the passionate air. Launcelot. There is no garden like it in the world. Guenevere. I did not guess you were so fond of gardens. I thought of you with lance and battle-axe In the forefront of war—yet not as one That kills his fellows with a savage joy— But with pale brow where anger never writ His ugly name in frowns. Launcelot. You thought of me? Guenevere. Who does not think of you? Your fame is blown Further than Cameliard. Launcelot. And you thought of me As hard and cruel? Guenevere. Never for a breath! And yet I did not think that you would feel The strange delicious sweet of such a place. Launcelot. I never felt it as I do to-day,— Though I remember, when I was a boy, There was a beautiful lady who would come Across the lake and take me in her skiff And tell me wondrous tales, tales which still make A low confusèd murmur in my brain Like the vague undertone of many bees. I called her “fairy mother” then, but now Men tell me that she was that Nimue, The Lady of the Lake, whom Merlin loves. I know not. I remember only how I leaned my head over the boat's edge, looking Deep through the water to another sky, So clear the water was; and, as I leaned, My soul went swooning down that crystal space, Down, down forever, till sinking seemed to turn To rising, with the sky not far away. Guenevere. Tell me more of your life. You must have seen So much in its young course—have done so much. Launcelot. Nay, little that I can remember. I am Strangely unable to distinguish one Good or ill hap out of the blur of things, Battles and tourneys, one much like the other, And lost already in the murmurous past. I feel as if I were just born to-day With life before me like this summer air, Hushed, as in waiting for a bird to sing, Who yet delays, and all is fresh and fair, And hope stands flushing like a rosy boy Upon a threshold which he fears to cross. But what I fear or what I hope, indeed I hardly know—and yet I hope and fear. Guenevere. But surely some recognizable peak Soars up among the mountains of your deeds That you can show me. Launcelot. Indeed there is a height So near me that it shuts out all my life; But I have not attained it. One event I well remember, but it was a vision, Not an achievement. That was when I first Beheld you. Guenevere. Have you seen me, then, before? And you remember it and I forget? Launcelot. I should have died of faintness in the hills If you had not stood by. Guenevere. What, were you he Whom Dagonet the Fool saved? Launcelot. I am he. Guenevere. How strangely are the threads of life inwoven!— Yet since you will not tell me of your deeds, Tell me at least for whom you do them. Launcelot. Ah, me! Guenevere. I know that for some dame or damosel You do them. Tell me, by the faith you owe me, Who is the lady? For I know thou lovest. Launcelot. Say that I do so, were it not far better That this new birth had never been conceived; Since even while I babble of its joy, Grief glooms above it like the shadow of death? Guenevere. What part hath grief in thee, Sir Launcelot? I might as soon paint sorrow on the face Of blessed Michael standing in the sun. Launcelot. Queen, that I love is true; and love should be More joy on earth than Michael hath in heaven. But I have been too much beloved of Fortune; And she hath dowered me with all goodly gifts Only in the end to turn them to a gibe. For all my feats of arms were done for you, And if you love me not, it had been better My mother died a maid—and should you love, Which yet I dare not hope, our lives must be Like outcast angels, glorious with shade, A bitter gladness and a radiant woe. Ay, for 't is you I love. Love leaped to life Within me when I saw you in the hills, As Saint John leaped within his mother's womb When Mary drew near, childing of the Christ. Speak to me! Will you outstare marble? God! I say, I love you. See, I crawl to you!— I pray you pardon me. I see you are Too merciful to speak. I give you pain;— I have spoken wildly. Fare you well! I will not— [Rushes off.] Guenevere. He loves me! Oh, how good it is to draw Deep breaths of this rich-scented air. The odor Seems to pass into me. Does love transfigure The world like this? Nay, then it is a god, That's certain. [Enter Galahault at the back among the trees. Launcelot follows him, beseeching.] Launcelot. Oh, be silent for my sake Or I shall die of shame. [Throws himself on his face under a willow in the background.] Galahault [advancing]. O cruel Queen! What have you done to my poor friend? Look where He lies upon his face and heaves his sides, Like a dumb animal hurt unto death. Oh, what a loss were there, if he indeed, Pierced with your scorn, should die! Guenevere [musing, unconscious of Galahault's presence]. The greater loss Were mine. O heart, my heart, rememberest thou What he has said? Galahault. What? Guenevere. If his words be true, He has done all his deeds of arms wherewith The sky's blue concave rings, for me, me only. Galahault. He may well be believed, for as he is Of all men the most valiant, so he hath A truer heart than others. Guenevere. They say well That he of all men is most valorous, For he has done such doughty feats of arms As no knight else. And this, all this he did For me. Galahault. Why, then, you should be pitiful. Guenevere. How pitiful, in sooth? The cliffs and crags Of Cameliard have left me ignorant Of much, I doubt not, that our Camelot dames Suck with their mother's milk. But yesterday Love was to me an idle poet's song. Galahault. This is not yesterday; for now you know How more than all fair women he loves you, More than his life, yes, more than his own soul; And that for you he has done more than knight Did ever yet for lady. Guenevere. More indeed Than I can ever merit. Could he ask Anything of me that I could deny? —But he has asked me nothing. Only he is So sorrowful that it is marvellous. Galahault. Then heal that sorrow, madam, for you may. Guenevere. He asked me nothing. Galahault. Nor would never ask, Love is so fearful when it is new-born. But I plead for him. This is what he would,— That you should love him and retain him ever To be your knight, and that you should become His loyal lady for your whole life long. Grant this and you will make him richer far Than if you gave the world. Guenevere. I have given him all The world I have, the world of my own thoughts, Desires and aspirations, hopes and fears. —You see, I trust you, sir. I know not how You come upon my dream, like a strange shape That casts a shadow where no shadows are. But you are here, although you be but thickened Out of the air before me, as my thoughts In like wise now round to a definite orb. I know that he is mine and I all his, And that you somehow, strangely, have been part Of things ill done and mended. Launcelot. No, I dream. It is not she that speaks. Dear God, if this Be but a dream, oh let me die and find That heaven is just to dream forever thus. Galahault. Gramercy. Now 'tis fit you enter on Love's service. Kiss him once before me, madam, For the beginning of true love. Guenevere. Those yonder, sure, Would marvel much that we should do such deeds. Galahault. No one will see. [Turns away.] Guenevere. And if they did?—Why, Launcelot, You tremble like a leaf. Will you not kiss me? Are you afraid? Nay, then I will kiss you. [She takes him by the chin and kisses him.] Curtain. ACT III. Scene I. —Camelot. Gallery and portico in the apartments of the Queen of Orkney, overlooking a great water. Lionors and Borre. Borre. Mamma, I like to talk to you about Gawaine. Lionors. Why, darling? Borre. Because you hold me close to you, And kiss me so. Lionors. My little innocent wisdom! Borre. Gawaine never kisses me. And yet he is kind; He gives me sweets and—Oh, mamma, look! look! The moon—how big it is! It comes right up, Right up out of the mere, just like Gawaine When he is swimming. You know, he plunges under And then his head comes up 'way over yonder, And then he shakes the drops out of his hair And wipes his eyes with his fingers. The moon is bald Like poor old Hugh the gardener. That's why The water doesn't stick to it. Lionors [kissing him]. Sweetheart! See How still the moonlight lies upon the water! Borre. It's like a silver road. Lionors. How would you like For you and me to go out hand in hand As we do i' the meadows, and pluck those flowers That grow on the waves by moonlight, and so go on And on and on until we came to Fairyland? Borre. I'm 'fraid we'd get our feet wet. Lionors. I'm afraid we might. Borre. But what's a road for, if you mayn't walk on it? Mamma, I don't think it's a road at all; It's a river. Lionors. A river, love? Borre. A river of shine; The fairies go swimming in 't. [Enter Peredure.] Lionors. Good even, sir. The Queen of Orkney is engaged within. So please you wait with me a little while, She'll see you presently. Peredure. I will remain; You are very gracious.—Well, my little dreamer! What are you thinking of, with your great brown eyes Looking so wistfully on the mere? Come, kiss me. What do you see out there? Borre. My lord, who lives I' the sea? Peredure. Why, the fishes, Borre. Borre. And the old crabs With their great ugly claws—I know. But I think A princess lives there in a crystal palace, All white and cool, with crabs to guard the gates. That's why their arms are so long, you know—to catch The robbers with. Peredure. Are there robbers in the sea? Borre. Oh, yes! that's such a pretty story. Mamma, Tell it to him—you know, the one you told Last night—about the water-kelpies that tried To steal the princess' treasure. Lionors. Some other time, Sweetheart. Borre. Oh, please, mamma, please tell it! Lionors. Not To-night, dear. It grows late, and it is time For little folk to be abed. Come, Borre, We'll go find nurse.—Excuse me, pray, my lord; I will return soon. Borre. I don't want to go; I am not sleepy. Peredure. Let me carry him. Wouldn't you like a ride upon my shoulder? That's it. Now we go. Lead on, my lady. Borre. Hey! [Exeunt Lionors, Peredure, and Borre.] [Enter Morgause and Publius.] Publius. If it be true, as you suspect— Morgause. No fear! You are very wise and subtle, good my lord, But trust a woman's wit as subtler still Where woman's heart's at question. You were there; Your eyes were fixed, as all eyes, on the Queen; Yet you nor no man there saw what I saw. I tell you, when a woman's eyes are lit With such a light as that I saw in hers The while she gazed at Launcelot, 'tis small matter Whether she flinch or falter to the world— She loves. Publius. Well, let us grant, then, that she loves; You women sometimes prove absurdly right, And I incline to trust you. But the King Will ask more solid proofs. Morgause. And he shall have them! Ay, if I pull the ruin on myself, I'll find the engines somewhere to upheave The pillars of his peace. Oh, he doth vex me Beyond endurance with that calm of his, That silly satisfaction on his face, As if he were some god, forsooth, and deigned To live with men as a sun might deign to shine. Publius. Do not forget the most important thing, That Launcelot must quarrel with the King; For thence I see a great advantage grow For Rome, and you will not forget, I hope, That Cæsar's vantage wins for Arthur's ruin. I do not ask you why you hate the King; Work for my ends and I will work for yours. Morgause. Agreed. But we must cast our lines for proofs,— And yonder comes an angle for my hook. Withdraw, my lord; leave me alone with him. Publius. My humble duty, madam. [Exit.] [Enter Peredure.] Morgause. Peredure! It is kind in you to come to me, my lord. Sit by me here. I am sad to-night and know not What 'tis oppresses me. Peredure. Would that I had The power to shield off sorrow from you, madam! Morgause. Why, would you use it if you had, my lord? A little thing might do it for the nonce, But yet I fear me you would scruple. Peredure. Scruple? I am no coward; I would die to serve you. Morgause. I know you are no coward, and I think You are indeed my friend.—Too much of this! You are a poet. Sing me a sweet song, Whose music may caress my painèd heart. Peredure. Lend me your cithern, lady. Morgause. Who says now That I am not the royalest queen alive, That have a king's son for my troubadour? Peredure [sings]. You remind me, sweeting, Of the glow, Warm and pure and fleeting, —Blush of apple-blossoms— On cloud-bosoms, When the sun is low. Like a golden apple, 'Mid the far Topmost leaves that dapple Stretch of summer blue— There are you, Sky-set like a star. Fearful lest I bruise you, How should I Dare to reach you, choose you, Stain you with my touch? It is much That you star the sky. Why should I be climbing, So to seize All that sets me rhyming— In my hand enfold All that gold Of Hesperides? I would not enfold you, If I might. I would just behold you, Sigh and turn away, While the day Darkens into the night. Morgause. You sigh, my lord. Did not the lady yield, After so sweet a plaining in her ear? ... Methinks I had not been so obdurate. To give unsought is sweetest to the giver. Love such as yours, that asks no recompense, Pleads for that reason more persuasively. ... Men love not often so—in Camelot. Peredure. The beautiful lady of my soul, for whom My song was made, knows not my love for her. The greatest happiness that I can hope Is to sing for her, sitting at her feet, As I do now at yours. I dare not vex Her spirit with the story of my love, Lest I should lose the little bliss I have Nor gain no greater neither. Morgause. You are too fearful. Who would not throw a bit of glass aside To win a diamond? You cheat yourself With the vain semblance of a love, my lord. Be bold and snatch the real. Why, who knows But that your lady pines to yield herself As you to win her? Peredure. Oh, do not stir up The devil in my soul! There is a chasm Between our ways. Morgause. And will you let her droop And die, poor lady, dreaming that her life Is wasted ointment spilt out on the floor, When but a word were Siloam to her eyes To let her see she had poured a priceless chrism Over the very body of Love? If she Were I and spoke to you as I do now, How would you answer her? Peredure. Upon my knees. Forgive me, my beloved. Morgause. What do you mean? Peredure. That you indeed are she. Morgause. Alas, alas! What must you think? Indeed I knew not this. Peredure. Oh, kill me with your hands, not with your grief. Oh love, love, love, I ne'er had thus offended, But all my brain was whirling with your words. Morgause. We are most fortunate and unfortunate. Peredure. And dost thou love, then, too? Morgause. I have loved thee long.— Why do you tremble so? Surely it is No sin that we should love. Peredure. Can that be sin Which makes me greater-hearted than before? Morgause. Why do you stand apart? Let me lean on you.— Oh, take me in your strong arms, Peredure! Surely it is no sin for us to kiss. Peredure. God help me, I scarce know where sin begins; For I am caught up in a wind of passion That sweeps me where it will. [The tinkling of a lute without.] Morgause [starting]. It is not safe For you to be found here so late. I hear My women with their lutes. Nay, do not go— Nay, but you must—but first one kiss, my love.— Give me the key to your secret door. I'll come To you; we shall be more secure than here. Peredure. Come quickly, then, or I shall scarce believe But I have slept i' the moonlight and seen visions. —Yet one more kiss, as sweet as the perfume Of sandal burning in a darkened room! I am drunk with this new joy. Morgause. Within two hours. Peredure. I live not till you come. Morgause. Oh, leave me, leave me! You will be found. Farewell! Peredure. Love, love! [Exit.] Morgause. This key Shall unlock more secrets than a secret door. [Ladinas climbs up from below with a lute. The scene closes.] Scene II. —A street in Camelot. Enter The Watch. First Watchman. I say it and I say it again, that the King hath the strongest arm in the kingdom. Second Watchman. Not a doubt of that! Third Watchman. Our King be a powerful fighter. Fourth Watchman. Not but I think our Owen, the blacksmith, would run him hard. First Watchman. Oh, you think, do you? You're a fine one to think. Owen, the blacksmith! Third Watchman. They as thinks, goes to hell; leastwise Father Aurelian says so. First Watchman. Owen, the blacksmith! Fourth Watchman. Well, I suppose a blacksmith may have muscle in his arm, as well as a king. First Watchman. Ah, there you goes a-supposing. The King, sir, is the King, and is not to be supposed. Third Watchman. Ay, 'tis a hanging matter to suppose the King—except for the Pope. The Pope can suppose anything. First Watchman. You go too much to the priests, David. Father Aurelian knows not everything, though I will not deny that he can say mass quicker than any priest in Camelot. The Pope cannot touch the King except in the way of cursing, and it's not likely the Holy Father would curse anybody —unless he were mightily provoked. Second Watchman. That's true, neighbor. First Watchman. The King is the head in things temporary, and the Pope in things spirituous. Second Watchman. And that's true, too. First Watchman. And I say again, the King is the strongest man in the kingdom. Before he was crowned, he pulled the great sword out o' the stone at Canterbury, where it was fast stuck, so that all the nobles in Britain had tugged away at it and none o' them so much as budged it. And they say the devil put it there, but that is not likely, for the Archbishop said that whoever should pull it out should be king, and it's not to be believed that the Archbishop would meddle with the devil. Well, at last the King came, but he was not King then, but no matter for that; and he heaved away at it and out it came so sudden that away went His Majesty heels over head backward and was near to break 's neck. And they call the place Arthur's Feat to this day, because there Arthur lost his feet. And I say, the King is the strongest man in Britain. Third Watchman. But that was a magic sword; it vanished afterward. First Watchman. Magic! Poh, David, you'll believe anything. Third Watchman. If it did not vanish, where is it now? Answer me that. First Watchman. Masters, we are set here to apprehend benefactors. But I take it that no benefactors will be in the street at this hour, for there is a law that no one be abroad after nine o' the clock but the King's watch. Let us go into Master Howell's tavern. If there be any benefactors they will be there. Fourth Watchman. Ay, we'll go have a pot of ale. But we must come back anon, for there might be honest men abroad. First Watchman. Truly, and if any honest men be stirring, they will take it ill that the watch be not by to protect them. Third Watchman. But 'tis against the law to be out at this time o' the night; and can a man be a true man and break the law? First Watchman. In a case of necessity he may, for necessity knows no law. And I feel myself a pressing necessity now for strong waters. Come, masters. [Exeunt.] [Enter Guenevere, disguised as a Page, and Galahault.] Guenevere. Pray, how much farther is it? We have come A long way from the palace. Galahault. We have but To cross the little bridge beyond and pass Under the row of willows to the left, And we are there. It is a place I built Some years ago when I had use for it. But now the flowers have sown themselves at will And the wild vines, untrimmed, have overflowed The trellises and run along the ground, Tangled with violets, and hollyhocks Start straight and sudden in the very walks. The simple people of the neighborhood Say it is haunted, having no way else To explain infrequent lights and seldom signs Of habitation in such solitude. Yet though it has a barbarous outside, You'll find within that all has been made ready Even for a queen's sojourn. Guenevere. I thank you, sir. How looked he when you left him? Galahault. Why, as one Who is about to die and has seen heaven Opening before him. Guenevere. But did he send no word? Oh, pardon me, I have lost all my pride, And I must hear you speak of him. Watch [within]. Ho, there! Galahault. Stand close, it is the watch;—and speak no word, But keep your face in shadow. [Enter the Watch.] First Watchman. Stand all together that they may not rush upon us suddenly and overpower us. —Who goes there? Galahault. What, old Griffith! What do you mean, you old oracle? Do you forget me? First Watchman. Bless us, masters, if it be not the Prince! I hope your Highness will pardon me. Now who'd a-thought 't 't would a-been your Highness? Ah, your Highness knows what's what, a-going about in the night, when all honest folk is a-bed. But it's not for me to say when your Highness should go in or come out. And I hope your Highness will not forget the watch. Galahault [throwing purse]. Drink my health, Griffith,—you and your fellows. And if you get very drunk, I'll see you are none the worse for it. Come, boy. [Exeunt Galahault and Guenevere.] Second Watchman. What did he give you? First Watchman. Gold! Ah, there's a prince for you, he is! I have carried him home drunk these many times. He knows what belongs to a gentleman. And did you hear what he called me? An oracle. That's as much as to say, a man of parts. Mark Antony was an oracle—he that killed Cæsar in the play. He killed him oracularly. Fourth Watchman. Not a one of you had come back but for me. You were so thirsty you could see naught but the tavern window. First Watchman. Never you mind. We'll have a drink now as is a drink—and none the worse for waiting and letting our mouths water. [Exeunt.] Scene III. —Merlin's Tower. Merlin. Enter Dagonet, unperceived. Merlin. Burn, burn, ye leaping flames! And yet in vain. Ye cannot burn away the prison-bars That gaol my soul from knowledge. Yet burn on; A little and a little still I learn. Yet all the knowledge man can win avails But to avoid the shock of mighty forces Which he can neither deviate nor control. I look out on the rushing of the world As one who sees the gloom of swirling waters In the abyss of midnight. On they sweep, Fatal, resistless, plunging as one mass From turbulence to booming turbulence. Whence? Whither? Ye occult unconscious Powers! How shall I call upon you? By what names? What incantations?—Fool, what do you here? Dagonet. Father Merlin, when will the devils appear? Merlin. What mean you, Fool? Dagonet. Were you not conjuring? I cry you mercy, I thought it was an invocation to Flibbertigibbet. Sir Kaye says that Asmodeus was your father, but the Devil himself will be saved ere his wits stop leaking. Merlin. I do not take that. How should his wits leak? Dagonet. Marry, I am sure his brain's cracked. He put me in the pillory the other day for making a jest that passed his understanding, but he will be pilloried with my jest long after I have ceased jesting with his pillory. Merlin. What, were you in the pillory, Dagonet? Dagonet. Long enough to feel an imaginary ruff about my neck still. But by the intercession of the Queen, I was delivered. I hope her issue may be nobler. Merlin. Her issue? Where is the sequence in this? Dagonet. That if her issue be no nobler than mine, it will be something scrofulous, for I was delivered of a galled neck. Father Merlin, can you undo a spell as well as contrive one? Merlin. Why, Fool? Dagonet. The Prince of Cameliard is bewitched; he does nothing but sigh. Merlin. Why, you should be the physician to heal him of that ailment. For what purpose else does the King keep you? Dagonet. Nay, the jester is a physician that heals none but the well. The sick will have none of him, neither the sick in body nor in wit nor in heart; for the sick in their bodies desire the sympathy of long faces; and the sick in their wits think they are mocked, because they do not understand what is said; and the sick in their hearts speak another language—laughter is bitterness to them and their recreation is in groans. And Prince Peredure is in the third of these categories,—he is in love. Indeed, Father Merlin, he is past my medicining, and I would you would cure him. Merlin. Would you have me cure youth of love? Then I were a magician indeed. And yet I know, in part, of what you speak; And I would counsel you, good Dagonet, To have an eye upon the Queen of Orkney. She works with devious indirections, and This love of Peredure may be to her A point to rest the lever on, wherewith She pries at greater matters. Come with me; I have employment for you. 'T works so, does 't? Fate lays on her a bitter-hearted life; Even as long ago I prophesied That woe should whelm her past all woman's woe And woe past woman's from her heart should flow To whelm the world—and Time unwinds it so. [Exeunt.] Scene IV. —A forsaken garden. Launcelot. Launcelot. It is the hour; and yet they do not come. The sentinels grow drowsy at their posts; And the wind rustles through the moonlit leaves Like one that tosses on a sleepless bed And wishes for the dawn. The shadows sleep, Silent as time, beneath the silent stars; And distant dogs behowl the loneliness. O Moon, look down and lead my love to me! ... Sir Galahault! Sir Galahault! I wonder If it were wise to trust to you so far. Nay, 't is unknightly in me to misdoubt So true a heart. Who else but he had made The evil fortune of my love his own And dared for me all I myself can dare? And yet to take my joy within his doors, With secret entrance like a midnight thief,— It irks me. Bah, I am a fool! What's place Or time, when I clasp hands with Guenevere? To look into her eyes is to forget That space exists, beyond her circling arms! Hark! did I hear the rustle of a cloak? Or was 't the wind i' the lilacs? [Enter Galahault.] Galahault! Alone? Galahault. Are you alone? And is all safe? For what I bring with me is worth all Britain. Launcelot. All Britain? All the world! [Enter Guenevere.] My queen! my queen! Guenevere. Sir Galahault, needs must that once you loved. 'T is some lost lady's memory, sure, that stirs Your will to do these gentle deeds. Galahault. I know Love is the one intelligible word Life utters.—But I pray you, pardon me [smiling], I know, besides, that though you throw an alms Of kind thoughts to a man whose life is lived, The fleet-foot hours are restless to become Spendthrift of richer treasure. Fare you well! I will not irk you with a formal leave. [Exit.] Guenevere. Now! Launcelot. Heart to heart! Guenevere. Oh, do not jar with speech This perfect chord of silence!—Nay, there needs Thy throat's deep music. Let thy lips drop words, Like pearls, between thy kisses. Launcelot. Thy speech breaks Against the interruption of my lips, Like the low laughter of a summer brook Over perpetual pebbles. Guenevere. Nay but, love, It is the saucy pebbles that provoke The brook's discourse; for, where the bed is smooth, The waters glide as silent as a Dryad That disappears among the silent trees. Launcelot. And so our kisses still provoke our speech. Guenevere. Why, if the night must first be smooth of kisses, I fear that I shall talk until the dawn. Launcelot. Alas, that dawn should be so soon! Guenevere. We will Divide each moment in a thousand parts, And every part a pearl; and they shall make A rosary of little lucent globes, Innumerous as the dewdrops of the dawn: And, counting them, night shall seem infinite. Launcelot. Yet even now we count them, and they pass. Sit, Guenevere, here where the moonlight laughs Across your hair, and the night wind may touch Your throat and chin, as I do now. Guenevere. O love, My lips will weary you, too often kissed. Launcelot. Why, then the night will weary of the moon. Guenevere. But I'll be strange and chide; and then a cloud Will pass between you and the moon. Launcelot. Nay, then The moon will 'broider with her light the cloud,— And I will kiss again, to hear your chiding. Guenevere. My voice will weary you, too rarely still. Launcelot. Then will the leaves grow weary of the wind.— Hark, how they laugh into each other's ears And whisper secrets for pure merriment! Guenevere. My love will weary you, too undisguised, Too wild, too headlong, too unlimited! Launcelot. Then God will weary of the joy of heaven! O love, in whom even Love's perversity Is lovely! O chameleon-colored heart! Look, I have seen a sky at sunset lapse From gold and flame to misted violet And through a thousand shifting colors more, Olive and pearl and myriad hues of rose, Each lovelier than the last. Even such a sky Thy heart is. Guenevere. Then must thou be like the sun, For from his kiss the sky takes on her hue. And surely, if the sun took human shape, He would become even such a man as thou, My live Apollo! Spendthrift of thy brightness! —Nay, let us stay awhile yet, for the night Doth seem attunèd to our hearts and they Incorporate with the night. Was e'er before Such rapture in the air? Launcelot. O teasing Queen! You slip through my desires and glide away As a seal swims. Ah, why will you be coy? Yet coy or bold, each shifting mood you wear More than the last entrains. Guenevere. I give you all; I am no niggard to keep something back. But yet, I pray you, stay a little while. There is a sweetness in all things that pass; We love the moonlight better for the sun, And the day better when the night is near; The last look on a place where we have dwelt Reveals more beauty than we dreamed before, When it was daily. This is my last hour Of girlhood; and, although the wider days Bring greater guerdons and more large delights, Yet this one thing they shall not bring again. Love, yet a little while! Launcelot. Your girlhood, say you? Guenevere. I know not how to tell you— The morn that followed on my wedding night, War called the King to Cornwall,—since which hour I have not seen him.—That one night, indeed, We lay down side by side;—but, seeing I shrank And shook as one that fears she knows not what, The King unsheathed his sword Excalibur And placed it for a sign between us twain, —And all night long the sword divided us. Launcelot. Mine, mine, all mine! Guenevere. All thine, my Launcelot, Body and soul! My husband! Launcelot. Ay, dear wife, Although the cowled monastic trees have been The only priests of our great bridal. Guenevere. Husband! I laugh into your hair with the mere joy Of saying it over so. ... The wicked stars Are twinkling with a mischievous delight To spy on us. Launcelot. Then are they like you now, The roguery of heaven. Anon, you'll change And be its splendor and its mystery. Let us go in; I have seen you as a vision Of morning in the hills, and as a Queen, And as the dainty mimicry of a boy; But I would see you grand and undisguised And clothed upon with moonlight and sweet air. [They enter the house. Then all is silent, save for a rustle of wind in the leaves and the voice of a distant watchman, calling the hour. A nightingale begins to sing in the thicket.] Curtain. ACT IV. Scene I. —The Same. Enter Launcelot and Guenevere. Launcelot. It is the morning star that hangs so high; Love, you must leave me. Guenevere. Must I so indeed? How can I leave you?—For I live in you. You are the only concord in my life; Without you I am but a jarring note And all the world mere noise. Launcelot. No, leave me not. What though the world outcast us! We will be A world unto ourselves. Let Britain sink Beneath the Atlantic and the solid base And universal dome of things dissolve And like the architecture of a cloud Melt in the blue inane! You are my country, My world, my faith, my rounded orb of life. Guenevere. Without you life would be but breathing death. Launcelot. Oh, we will find some island in the seas, Some place forsaken of the unjust world, A larger image of this garden here, Where nature's luxury and Art's decay Proclaim emancipation— Guenevere. There's no such place. The greedy world would rush in at your heels And turn your paradise into a mart. Nay, you were right, and I must leave you, love, And ere yon pale streaks ripen into rose, Resume the Queen. But yet one breath beneath These morning-cool old elms before we part, One last love-dreaming!—How can I be sure Thou lovest me? Is life so generous Of joy? Launcelot. Oh, look in my true eyes and say If thou canst doubt me! Guenevere. Nay, I doubt thee not. If I had doubted, could I thus have stolen At midnight in a shameless page's suit And—oh, thou knowest I could not! Launcelot. Sweet and true! Guenevere. I feel as if I had put off the Queen With the Queen's robes and had become your page. Launcelot. You are my Queen, whatever garb you wear, And I your knight forever. But, thus clad, A thousand beauties are revealed, before Known only to surmise, or by foreknowledge That every beauty must be yours divined. Ay, cover 't with thy cloak! The prettiness O' the action o'er-repays my beggared eyes, Robbed of the treasure of that loveliness. Guenevere. For thy delight, love, I will dress me so Ten times a day—but never as a mask Again. Why wouldst thou send Sir Galahault To bring me here? Launcelot. For thy security. Here we are free from Argus-eyed intrigue. Guenevere. I like it not—or rather would not like it, Were I not too content to let my head Lie on your shoulder here—so—while Time seems To pause awhile and dream, beholding us. It is too much as if we shrank some peril; And I would shrink from nothing. Prithee, love, Henceforward let us meet without these shifts. Launcelot. O royal-hearted! Guenevere. Sweet, you hurt me. Launcelot. Nay, I would not hurt you. I would have my love A furnace fiery as the orient king's, But you should walk in it and be unharmed. Guenevere. Was ever woman loved as you love me? Launcelot. I think there never was; 't is something new Whereof I am discoverer. [Exeunt among the trees.] Scene II. —The adjacent country. Before the tent of Arthur. Arthur and Godmar. Godmar. Sire! Arthur. What is it, Godmar? Godmar. From the crest Of yonder hill one can see Camelot. Arthur. A forced march would have brought us there to-day; But to what end? The soldiers are fatigued. Godmar. Sire, we have marched but fifteen miles to-day. We started late and are already camped While it is hardly afternoon. Besides, The camp is careless as a hunt. Arthur. What then? Godmar. You will destroy all discipline. Arthur. No, Godmar. They have earned a little ease; let them enjoy it. For tension unrelieved relieves itself And is ne'er taut again. Let them have time To talk and tell old stories in their tents And they'll forget their hardships, and each soldier Will presently begin to find himself Of moment to the State, no mere machine Useful and used as bows and catapults, But personal; and Britain thus will grow A thing wherein he hath a stake himself, And he will fight the better and submit More willing to her rule in that his will By head and heart alike is reinforced. Have couriers been sent forward? [Enter Merlin.] Godmar. One at dawn And one when we encamped. Arthur. How camest thou here? Merlin. On no enchanted steed; a plain mule brought me. I set out when your messenger arrived This morning. I have tidings you must hear Before your entry. Arthur. Well. Merlin. The Emperor Has sent a special envoy to your court, Whose undivulged commission, though with care And shrewdly hid, I have smelled out. In brief, Rome sends to bully you with warlike threats To pay the tribute. Arthur. You are my counsellors; What are your minds on this? Godmar. I am for war. Here is occasion for new victories And a world-wider glory. For my part, I think that peace is when the nation sleeps And when it wakes, that's war. For men in peace, Lacking brave emulation and the zeal Of a great cause, fall to their petty ends And, letting their high virtues atrophy, Wallow in lust and avarice, till the heart And nobler functions rot away and leave A people like an oyster, all stomach. Our men are bold with long success, valiant, Well-disciplined, far better warriors Than Roman libertines, and mercenaries That fight with half their hearts. The cause is just; For while Rome kept her legions in the land, Defending us from the sea-robbing Jutes And Saxons and against the mountain hordes Of barbarous Picts, there was a show of reason Why she should tax us; now we stand alone And ask and yield no favors. Merlin. Nor would I Advise your Majesty to yield an inch To this preposterous impudence. And yet Delay advantages the crescent power, And we are growing stronger every year And Rome declining. If we match her now, Ere long we'll have the odds. Her boundless wealth Gives her resources which our general Too lightly weighs. Nor should we overrate Our own security. We are one in rule But not in spirit yet, and local feeling Still outruns national. The Jutes in Kent Are yet a daily threat. Therefore, my liege, My counsel is that we meet words with words, Gain time to expel the aliens from our shores And discord from our hearts. Indeed I think The glory of your reign will more consist In leaving to the world a living State Than in your victories. And what most imports you Is to secure by wise executive The unity and welfare of the realm. Arthur. You have each spoken well, but I incline To Godmar's thought. You, Merlin, know full well The unity of Britain is the heart And purpose of my life; but I conceive This war will make the country more at one Than all our statecraft, for old enmities Will melt away into one common heart When Britons fight against a common foe. Besides, you shall yourself be deputy At Camelot, and our home management Shall be no loser. For the Jutes in Kent, We'll make them our allies, confirm their lands In fealty to ourself and win them over With promises o' the richer spoils of Rome. For I intend to sack her opulent towns And pay my soldiers from their treasuries; And this sea-people will supply me ships And sailors cunning in sea-faring war. And, more than this, I have ancestral claims To the imperial crown. We'll not return Until the Pope has crowned me Emperor. Godmar. No man on earth save Arthur, King of Britain, Could wield so glorious an enterprise. Arthur. What say you, Merlin? Merlin. 'T is a noble plan, Better than mine though something hazardous, And for a lesser captain foolhardy. And yet it has a weakness, for I fear The greatening power and riches of the Jutes. If Britain ever fall, 't will be by them. Arthur. They are too dangerous to be enemies; They must be friends. Merlin. My liege, a word with you In private. Godmar. Sire, permit that I withdraw. [Exit.] Arthur. What bitter news now, Merlin? Merlin. Be prepared For any unexpected blow you will. I fear your sister has some plot in hand Which I have not unravelled. Arthur. Morgause again! I have a senseless superstitious dread That from her comes my ruin;—but that's a dream. I'll not be goblin-ridden. Come within The tent and tell me more of your suspicion. [Exeunt.] Scene III. —Camelot. Night. The Gardens. Through the trees the towers and battlements. Enter Morgause and Ladinas from opposite sides, meeting. Morgause. Well? Ladinas. I have seen them. Morgause. Seen them? Ladinas. From the arbor I watched them as they strolled; yet too far off To hear their words—and yet their words were sweet. I could tell that although I heard them not, They leaned so to each other, like a pair Of rutting deer that rub their heads together Before they couple. What they said, no doubt, Had made a pretty song for the King's ear, Could it have been re-worded. Morgause. Was this all You saw? Ladinas. Be patient. I have not done yet. I saw them kiss—and Launcelot looked about With guilty fear, but Guenevere looked not But hung upon him motionless and dumb, Reckless of all the world. Much more I saw, But to be brief—at last, after what words I know not, they departed, she with head Erect, poised firmly on her royal throat, But he with wild eyes and a haggard face. I followed them. They went in by the wicket O' the private stairway of the Queen's apartments. Morgause. What say you? In broad noon? Ladinas. Ay, in broad noon. At least, she sins with royal carelessness. Morgause. Her royal carelessness! Her royal throat! Is she the only queen, then, in the world? Doth she bewitch you, too? Where got she drugs To make men love her? Do you find her fairer? Beware, La Rouse! You know how I can hate. Ladinas. Fairer? There are three fair ladies in the world, Iseult of Ireland, Guenevere, and thou— And thou art first among them. I will not Deny how beautiful she is, my queen— Thou art the fairer that she is so fair. Morgause. Leave courtly phrases till another time. What did you when her royalty had passed Into the palace? Ladinas. I bethought me then Of Peredure's apartments and the key. I had no thought to find an use so soon For that—love-trinket. I ensconced myself Behind a pillar in the gallery That overlooks the window of the Queen,— Morgause. And there you saw—? Ladinas. Enough! Not all I would,— There was a tantalizing incompleteness In what I saw; something, indeed, as when One thinks one sees more than one really does When the wind frolics with the petticoats. And yet I saw enough to make the Queen A laughter and a byword to the world. Morgause. Ha, ha, ha! So then my virtuous brother will receive A douse of dirty water for a welcome, When he returns to-morrow morn. The pomp Of his victorious arms will only serve To pageant out his shame. Ladinas. I have set down A formal notice with the Seneschal That at high noon to-morrow, when the King Ascends the throne in the Great Hall to hear The grievances and quarrels of his knights And render justice, I shall then appear And in the presence of the court “impeach Guenevere, Queen of Britain, Sovran Lady Of the Most Knightly and Christian Fellowship Of the Round Table, et cetera, of treason To the most gracious person of the King And to the safety of the realm, in living In shameless license with Sir Launcelot; And also I impeach for the same cause Sir Launcelot du Lac, the son of Ban—” Morgause. Spare me the legal rigmarole. By this, The noise is bruited over the whole palace. Ladinas. Be sure of that; Sir Kaye will never keep So rare a bit of scandal to himself. Morgause. Why, then we have won the throw. Oh, Ladinas, You have done that to-day that shall shake thrones! Launcelot will not tamely yield himself; Still less will he sit by and see his leman Dragged from him to the stake. This work of ours Casts Britain to the pit for the beasts of war To glut their bloodthirst on.—What's that to us? This upstart Queen and that false-hearted prig Who calls himself her husband and my brother— She lied, my mother, when she said she bore him! And, if he be her husband, what proves that But that he is a perjurer?—If she 'scape, He may be slain; and if they live, the shame Will daub them till they die. In any case I have revenge. I could carouse to-night Till the elves startled in the glens to hear The echo of my revelry. Come, kiss me! Oh, Ladinas, I am drunk with merriment. Again! again! My blood is flames of fire. Ladinas. Your lips burn and your cheeks are hot. Morgause! My pantheress! My splendid devil! [Enter Merlin.] Morgause. Beware! Merlin. You need no mock propriety. I am Too gray for envy and too well aware Of what you do for this play of concealment. And other things I know; be warned in time,— Let your intents take wing. Morgause. You are too late. Go to Sir Kaye and ask the news of him. I do not fear you, Merlin. Merlin. Fear you God? Morgause. God cheated me—you know of what I speak. I am his enemy as He is mine. [Exeunt Morgause and Ladinas.] Dagonet [springing up from behind a clump of bushes]. Poor God! Oh, Father Merlin, such roguery as I have overheard! But I will tell you anon, for now I must see whither they are going. [Exit.] [Enter Kaye, Gawaine, and Peredure.] Kaye. It is even as I tell you, gentlemen. Sir Ladinas has accused the Queen of high treason, for amours with Sir Launcelot. Peredure. Impossible! He dare not. Kaye. The indictment was placed in my hand not above an hour ago. God knows how 't will all end. Peredure. By heaven, he is not chary of his life! Gawaine. I say 't is an outrage. What an if it were true? They are the royalest pair in Christendom; 't is shameful to seek to dishonor them. Peredure. True? Why, you lily-livered boy, you dare To hint it? By all the saints, if you were not Your mother's son, that word had been your last. [A light appears in a window above.] Gawaine. I pray you, pardon me; she is your sister. I had forgot it. But I mean to say That, were Sir Launcelot guilty twenty times, He doth as far this Ladinas o'erpeer As mountains anthills. Fie, a worm, a snail! Kaye. 'T is most deplorable. Let us bring the news To Galahault and the others. [Exeunt Kaye and Gawaine.] Merlin. Prince, do you see the light in yonder casement? Peredure. It is the chamber of the Queen of Orkney. What of it? Merlin. Would you know who has set on This foul conspiracy against the Queen, Make you that light your searchlamp. Peredure. What, you mean—? Merlin. I mean that if you follow up my clue To thread the meaning of this labyrinth, 'T will draw you, like a moth, into that flame. I mean that in that dark unriddled heart That beats beneath the beauteous breasts of Orkney, Lies like a cancer the true reason why Your sister's fame is smirched. Peredure. By heaven, 't is false! As soon the rosy labor of the dawn Might bring forth darkness. Now, by all hell's fiends Unless I meet an enemy ere long Beside old age and boyhood, I shall break My sword against the senseless stones! What, she? Merlin. Alas, I pity you, but truth will not; It is the truth. [Exit.] Peredure. By the five wounds of Christ, It is the foulest lie that e'er was told. —Lamp of my soul, behind yon lattice lies More mystery, more beauty, more delight Than grizzled Merlin with his lapse of years Has ever dreamed of. There's more credit writ In thy dear smile than all his subtleties. Ah, opal-hearted! now she doth unclothe The solemn sweep of her majestic limbs, The mystery of her awful loveliness; And draws the curtains of her couch about her As some earth-goddess of old northern tales Might draw the heavy drapery of the night. [Enter Dagonet.] Dagonet. My lord!—My lord!—Even her casement throws him into a catalepsy. Now what brew hath the witch borrowed from Circe, that this poor poet should be transformed into an ass? What ho, my lord! Peredure. Is it you, Dagonet? Dagonet. Like a chair in a dark room; you wish I were out of the way. (Aside). Oh, that I were anything but what I am, the bearer of ill news! I could wish I were a dog, a mongrelly cur, with somebody kicking me. (Aloud.) Are you brave, my lord? Peredure. Brave? Dagonet. I know you are as quick in a quarrel as a Spaniard, and will whip out your rapier on less provocation than any man at the court. But are you brave? (Sings) For there are worser ills to face Than foemen in the fray; And many a man has fought because— He feared to run away. Ri fol de riddle rol. Are you brave, sir? Peredure. Sure, the Fool's mad. Good Dagonet, I am not in the humor for these fopperies. Dagonet. Said I not that I was in the way? But, cry you mercy now, would you not thank even a joint-stool, if barking your shins against it saved you from a stumble into the kitchen water-butt? Peredure. Past doubt, Dagonet. What have I to do with this? Dagonet. Prithee, bark your shins against me, then, and save yourself from drowning, for the butt that lies in your path is bottomless. Peredure. I am in a mood to be exasperated by trifles. If you have ought to me, say it; if not, pray leave me to myself. Dagonet. Indeed I have something to say, but I know not rightly how to go about it. Sir, you are in love— Peredure. Zounds! Dagonet. And I would not have you made the tool of an unworthy woman. Peredure. Why, you piebald rascally slave— Dagonet. Be patient with me, sir; and if I do not prove your love a lewd trickster and traitress, beat me from here to Orkney and back again. Peredure. Lewd?—traitress?—Oh, Christ in heaven! You rogue! you varlet! do you dare—? Dagonet. Hear me, for I swear I speak no more but the truth! Sir, I have loved you since you were a child on my knee and used to play with my bauble for a toy. Do you think I would tell you so bitter a thing for wantonness? Peredure. Nay, it cannot be but you are abused; some villain, some scurvy rancorous villain hath abused you—but 't was I he aimed at with his knavery. Who was it, Dagonet? Tell me and if I do not run him through with my sword as I would a snake—My God, if I do not find some tangible enemy, I shall burst my heart. Dagonet. An I thought my eyes were such rascals as you have called them, I would pluck them out. Oh, my lord, tear this false woman out of your heart. She is not worthy that you grieve for her. Peredure. What, will you persuade me the world's a madman's dream? have a care, have a care! I grow dangerous. Dagonet. Come with me and see for yourself. I would I could not show you what I must. Peredure. Lead on;—but if you have played me false, you had better have fallen in a tiger's jaws. Dagonet. I have no more to say. If you will not hear, see. [Exeunt Dagonet and Peredure.] [Enter Launcelot and Guenevere.] Guenevere. I know that we must take up the old life Again, made harder than it was before But sweeter too. And yet it is all so new, So glad! A little longer we will dream. To-day we will not think of anything But the dear joy of loving. Launcelot. The kind Fates Have given to us this hour. We will not mar it. To-morrow's riddles let to-morrow solve. Guenevere. I am so glad I am a woman, love. I have quarrelled with my sex; but now I see The heart is keener to recoil from wrong Than to divine the right, for all my life Was thwarted but I guessed not why. But now I would not be a man for all the world. Launcelot. Nay, I must pity you that you are a woman, for so you miss life's greatest gift—the joy of loving one. Guenevere. I would love the woman's way. It is great to be a man, but it is delicious to be a woman. [Enter Merlin at some distance, with an astrolabe.] Launcelot. Look yonder! How like a visioned memory Old Merlin glides among the trees Guenevere. He comes This way; I will accost him. Merlin, ho, What have you there? Merlin. An instrument to measure The motions of the stars. Guenevere. Then have you been In converse with them of the weirds of men; For you are Destiny's familiar. Merlin. As The child is of its mother, who unfolds What shreds of wisdom it may comprehend. Yon skies, that look so mild, are threatening; Some evil passes in the dark but what Its name or form the stars will not declare Till it unclose its formidable jaws And fire-like eat its prey and then itself. Guenevere. How wisely they look down from their high heaven, Meeting our baffled eyes with that clear sight Which no enigmas barrier! It must be In them, if anywhere, our eyes may read The secrets of our dooms. Merlin. Would you yourself Interrogate their silence? Guenevere. Nay, for then With each succeeding day I must renew The burden of the accumulated ills Of a whole life. Let all be unforeseen And then we shall not suffer till our time. Launcelot. Speak not so sadly. I seem to have just found out That human suffering is but a cheap price We pay for heavenly bliss. Think rather, then, Of joy— Guenevere. The greatest joy is greater still, When it comes sharp and sudden.—What was that? Merlin. Why, I heard nothing. Guenevere. Nothing? And you, my lord? Launcelot. Nothing. [The light in the window is extinguished.] Guenevere. I heard a woman's shriek.—Who comes? [Enter Galahault.] Galahault. Madam, I have sought you everywhere. Have you heard This tale that flies from lip to lip? Guenevere. What tale? Galahault. Then you must hear 't from me. Sir Ladinas Has made a formal accusation, touching The friendship you have shown for Launcelot, Which he misconstrues for a lawless love, Disloyal to the King. Launcelot. The dream is done— So suddenly— Merlin (apart). Alas, then, it is true. Galahault (to Launcelot). Be scanter of your speech, lest Merlin note. The Queen's good name's at stake. Guenevere. Why, gentlemen, What ails it with you that you stand aghast? It is the penalty of eminence That people grow familiar with our names; So reverence becomes garrulity, Then flippancy, then foulness,—till the highest Is made most common, and even the Sacred Name Debased to vile and lewd profanities. Come, Launcelot, I shall keep you at my side Even more than hitherto, that men may know That what I do is not for them to question. [Exeunt Guenevere and Launcelot.] Merlin. How royally she carries it!—Sir Galahault, you are the greatest and most powerful prince in the kingdom, and you have a shrewd knowledge of men and things. Why will you be an onlooker in life, not a participant? Galahault. I have drained my cup, and now I drink the air. There is nothing left for me but the ideas of things. What is all this in search of? Merlin. Sir, I grow old and I need younger men To hold my hands up, like the Hebrew statesman. You are a man fit for diplomacy And I would have you for co-laborer In the affairs of state; but chiefly now I would have you assist me to undo This plot against the Queen. Guilty or guiltless, The credence of her guilt would rend asunder Our scarce yet welded kingdom. Galahault. I will do All that I may for Launcelot and the Queen. She has bound me to her with her regal ways; And he not only conquered my domain And won me in allegiance to the King,— His courtesy finished what his sword began, And won my heart too. Merlin. So with me as well The personal wish chimes with the general good. For Launcelot, as you know, was in some sort My foster-son; the Lady of the Lake Guided his first dream-thinking and myself Taught his quick-summered youth.—Go, then, about Among the lords and ladies of the court And everywhere proclaim her innocence. Opinion propagates itself; your stout Maintenance of her honor will convince Many by its mere confidence and make A party in her favor. In two hours Meet me in the laboratory in the tower. Galahault. Wisely devised; I'll set about it straight. [Exit.] Merlin. O Runic charactery, engraved in stars Upon the everlasting vault! wilt thou Forever mock us with unriddled speech? Has thought no cleverness to cheat from Time The knowledge of thy grammar? And ye spirits Of earth and air that with uncertain voice Speak into too frail words divinities! Ye oracles and inspirations vague! We hear your utterance but we miss the sense. I am the wisest brain of them that know, And I'm Time's fool. The Queen, from whom I thought The perpetuity of the State should grow, Even she herself is the first sundering From whence disintegration spreads to all! Her fate has come upon her and the King's, And I foresaw not and forewarned them not. Nay, I myself wrought Arthur to her suit, Forethinking the realm's welfare. Alas, alas! I feel the bode of prophecy within me, And now surely I know that all my craft Shall be undone and all the King's high dream, And the Round Table shall pass utterly Which, like a sacrament, showed forth the round world In that ideal unto which it moves. How can this be? Blind Chance, that seems at times To have malevolent intelligence— [Enter Peredure, with dress disordered and without his sword.] The Prince of Cameliard? In this disorder? What is the matter, sir? Peredure. Art thou not Merlin? I think thou art; but make me sure, for I Cannot believe my eyes are truth-tellers. Merlin. For certain, I am Merlin. But, my lord, Why start you so and stare? You are not well. Peredure. Why, I am glad to hear it. To be well Is to be one in millions. I am glad That you are well, sir—very glad, by heaven! Merlin. This is too serious for the matter, and Attention is not in it. What would you say? What ill has happened? Alas, he hears me not. Peredure. I killed him in her bed. Merlin. Killed, say you, sir? Peredure. I see you have white hairs and a white beard; But yet I know what you, for all your wrinkles, Have never dreamed of. There is not a woman In all the kingdom, ay, in all the world, But she's a—magpie. Let's be merry, then! Let us have cantharids and wine! Merlin. My lord, Withdraw with me. There's wine within. Peredure. There's blood Within—wine, do you call it?—Ay, the butt's Split open now and all the wine's on the floor. The thirsty planks drink it up gloriously. In her bed, did you hear?—Just heaven! I tell you I killed him in her bed. Merlin. Whom did you kill? Peredure. Not her, not her! Look you, how modestly She gathers up her kirtle as she walks; And yet within 's twelve hours she hath been—Faugh! Merlin. What look you on? Peredure. Not her! She was too fair; I could not dapple that white skin with blood.— Give me your hand; I would touch something.—Death? She is not dead. How can her spirit walk? —Why, so! Why, so! She is gone again. Oh, Merlin, The moveless stars in heaven shift and reel And there is nothing stable in the world. Merlin. Come in with me out o' the damp night air; It is too chill to stand without your mantle. Peredure. Off, strange old man! I have a poniard yet. Off! I will kill the man that hinders me.— Why, how it glistens in the treacherous moonlight! Is it alive, that it should look on me With such a haunted silence?—'T is like the gleam Of death-fires in the cruel sea at night.— What does it say with its cold eye?—Why, now— God!—it comes back—that pallid room—Morgause— How fearfully a dead man glares by moonlight!— False, false!—O Christ!—O pitiful Virgin!—false! [He kills himself. As he falls, Merlin bends over him in the moonlight.] Curtain. ACT V. Scene.—Camelot. The Great Hall of the Palace. On the left, two thrones and other raised seats, not quite so high. Dagonet, Bors, and Attendants. First Attendant. Careful there, careful! Have you no respect for cloth of gold? Will you handle velvet like fustian? Dagonet [to Bors]. No, but they will wear fustian like velvet. And you heard them in the servants' hall, you would swear they were all dukes, every man of them. First Attendant. That will do. There is much elsewhere to be made ready and the King is even now at the gates of the city. [Exeunt Attendants.] Bors. It is the saddest tale I ever heard. Dagonet. I'll never attempt to undeceive a happy man again, if he be in love with Merlin's grandmother, Lilith herself. What a plague had I to do interfering? The devil take all meddlers, say I? Bors. And Merlin bade you seek me with this news? Dagonet. Knowing you to be a staunch friend to Launcelot, for he connects this new horror with the accusation against— Bors. Peace, break you off! Here is the Queen herself. [Enter Guenevere.] Good morrow to your Majesty. Guenevere. Sir Bors, You are my friend, I think; you are Launcelot's kinsman; You know—the world knows—all but Arthur know, Who comes with an unsuited holiday, What hangs above our heads. That we are guiltless Does not secure us from a guilty doom. We have need now of friends. Our dandies here Give me scant courtesy. I will not think That you too hold me cheaply or mistrust The faultless knighthood of Sir Launcelot. Bors. I know that Launcelot loves you—with such love As a true knight may offer when his lady Is wedded to another. And I would, In frankness, lady, you had been his bride. You had been none the less a queen; his father Was King of Benwick and his father's brother, My father, Bors, the King of Gaul. We both Are of as royal blood as Arthur is And might be kings, but that we love the King. For him we have resigned our ancient thrones, Content to be his liegemen, simple knights Of that Round Table which is the great sign Of brotherhood and true equality, Such is the love we bear him; but if he Should do dishonor to Sir Launcelot Or thee, whose knight Sir Launcelot is sworn, Let him take heed. We may resume our crowns. Guenevere. I thank you, sir. You are a noble friend. Sir Ector de Maris will be with us, Pelleas, Lionel, and Bleoberis— Bors. Ay, madam, all our kin. Guenevere. It will be much To have so strong a party in the court. Among the knights I brought from Cameliard Some must be faithful. There is great devotion Among them to my brother, and my brother Loves me as his own soul. He will not fail— Bors. Alas, my lady, then you have not heard! Guenevere. Heard? What? Has aught—? Bors. Oh, steel yourself, my Queen, For I must be the advertisement of woe. Peredure— Guenevere. Speak! What ill has happened to him? Bors. He is dead. Guenevere. Dead? my brother—dead! Bors. Alas, It is so—dead, and slain by his own hand. Guenevere. Grief loves to shoot twice at the selfsame mark,— Ah, like a skilful archer whose first shaft Hath pierced the centre, sends a second after, That with unerring niceness splits the first. Where did he this? Bors. There were two witnesses, Merlin and Dagonet. Let him tell the rest. Dagonet. It happened on this wise, my lady. Your brother was enamoured of the Queen of Orkney, —but in honorable fashion, for he fancied her to be as spotless as a Glastonbury nun. And with this he was fallen into such a melancholy that I feared he would lose his wits. I loved your brother and in my folly I sought to deliver him. I knew what a false jade was the theme of his idolatry and, indeed, that she was this six months coddling with that fine-feathered incontinent French magpie, Sir Ladinas de la Rouse. So I lay in watch for the couple, thinking that the truth, though a vile-tasting medicine, would cure him; and yesternight, finding the two together, I brought Peredure word. Guenevere. You did well, Dagonet; for 'tis far better To know and suffer than to be deceived And dote on loathsomeness. I knew myself Of this infatuation of my brother, Yet in the thick and tumult of my sorrows I took no heed of his. You have done well; No knight of the Round Table sheathes within His corselet a more true-steeled heart than you Cloak with your motley. Dagonet. I thank you for that speech. I did not this, forgetful of my Queen. When first I came on Ladinas and Morgause, Their talk was all of you,—how he had used A key that she had begged from Peredure, To gain an entrance to the prince's rooms, From whence he said, he had seen— Guenevere. I shall not fail To recognize this service at its worth.— Go on! When you told this to Peredure? Dagonet. Then was he like a man that puts his feet On ice whose wintry firmness has grown rotten With the April in the air, and when he thinks All steadfast, feels it sink from under him. Away he starts, wild as the tameless horse Of Tartary, and comes to where they lie. When I, less swift of foot, came up with him, I found him standing dumb, with bloody sword, Over the twitching corpse of that false knight, His senseless eyes fixed on Morgause, who cowered Behind the curtains, silent for dismay. Me she saw not, for ere I crossed the sill, He threw the hot sword at her feet and fled, Crying, “She is too fair, she is too fair!” Guenevere. Oh, better were it if his righteous heel Had stamped that viper out o' the world. Go on! Dagonet. There is no more to tell. I followed him, But ere I reached the gardens, he was dead. I found him lying pallid in the moonlight And ancient Merlin bending over him. Guenevere. He was too delicate to face the blasts Of this world's winter. He was all compassion, All gentleness, all love, all tender heart, So sensitive of thought that he could scarce Endure the passing of an aimless sigh, So frail of spirit that the silent days Were in themselves too burdensome a load. So,—let him rest. The jarring of the world Frets his fine ear no longer.—Gentlemen, Pray, leave me. I would think of him alone. Bors. Our hearts are with you. [Exeunt Bors and Dagonet.] Guenevere. Oh, that I could weep The copious blubber of a village maid, Uncurbed by royal pride, or consciousness That o'ermistrusts and will not slack the bit! Oh, could I weep—and empty woe with weeping! There is a swelling passion in my heart Will split all yet. I cannot like a girl Draw 't off in driblets. Oh, my blameless brother, Undone for a guilty world! And that which led To the discovery that was thy doom, A plot born of a woman's hate for me And of my reckless fate-contending love! Oh, what a tangled anarchy is life! If the rash Will strive in the helter-skelter To weave for itself a little ordered space, Its skilless touch pulls unexpected threads That tighten to 'ts own strangling. Peredure Is but the first. The implacable net is drawn About the feet of all that love us. Bors— Poor faithful, merry Dagonet—all who hold To Launcelot's cause—must all these spend their hearts That we may love? Do I love Launcelot? Oh, if I loved him, could I draw him on So to his own undoing? Shall his name That even in the young April of his deeds Greatens in splendor like the northering sun, Be made a refuse for the ragman world To fret and fumble with a prodding stick? O God! Shall I uncage the captive wolves Of war, to harry the whole land and rend The offenceless kern, to give my sorrow ease? It must not be. What right have I to love, What right have I to joy, that should so play The Tambourlaine and scourge so many woes To drag its chariot like his captive kings? It must not be. Oh, let me take an oath Before high heaven! Launcelot, I must save thee! Oh, heavy fate, to love and be a queen! Ay, Peredure, I know it now—too late! Had I but hearkened to your pleading foresight! Oh, Peredure, my brother! [Enter Launcelot.] Launcelot! Launcelot. Dear heart! Guenevere. Whence come you? Launcelot. Speakest thou so coldly? I passed Sir Bors without and Dagonet; They sent me hither, saying I should find The Queen here. So, indeed, I do and not The woman, not the eyes that met my eyes With proud confession, not the lips that spoke Quivering but dauntless, saying, “I love thee, Launcelot.” O Guenevere, hast thou forgot so soon That thou canst speak with this mechanic voice And look on me so vacantly? Guenevere. Forgot? I never shall forget. Launcelot. Then thou repentest. Ay, now I see the longing in thy face That thou hadst ne'er beheld me. Be it so. I was a selfish monster when I thrust My love into the forecourt of thy life. ... And yet—you loved me once. And oh, those hours When I could feel the warm breath from your lips Creep o'er my cheek and mingle with my hair! The sweet long hours whose lingering moments dripped Like rhythmic water-drops into a pool With silver parsimony of sweet sound As if Time grudged each globule! Why, now I see Tears in your eyes. Guenevere. O Launcelot, my king! Launcelot. My own true wife! Guenevere. Do not call back that time With any farewell cadence in your voice! And oh, do not reproach yourself, my god, For opening to me those golden doors! We lived then. Launcelot. There is honey on your lips As on the Theban child's. I am the bees That gather it—so. Guenevere. Launcelot!—No, no! I had forgot. Am I, then, like the rest? Is there so much o' the woman in my veins That resolution, buttressed in with vows, Cannot endure the first assault of love? We have had a radiant dream; we have beheld The trellises and temples of the south And wandered in the vineyards of the sun:— 'T is morning now; the vision fades away, And we must face the barren norland hills. Launcelot. And must this be? Guenevere. Nay, Launcelot, it is. How shall we stand alone against the world? Launcelot. More lonely in it than against it! What's The world to us? Guenevere. The place in which we live. We cannot slip it from us like a garment, For it is like the air—if we should flee To the remotest steppes of Tartary, Arabia or the sources of the Nile, Or that dim region lying in the west, Where Brandan's holy ships found anchorage, It still is there, nor can it be eluded Save in the airless emptiness of death. Launcelot. Say rather, like the miasmatic breath Of swamps that swarm to rankness. In the clear And unpolluted air of mountain-tops Freedom and solitude companion. Oh, Let the dense earth bring forth its venomous growths! It cannot harm us on the heights. Guenevere. We must not Attempt the ascent. The perils are too great That ward the way. Launcelot. What reck I of the perils Between me and the graal of my desires? Guenevere. To plunge the land in war! To rend the kingdom! Launcelot. You are worth all the kingdoms in the world. Guenevere. To drag our friends down with us in our fall! Launcelot. We shall not fall. And what is friendship worth That will not face adversity for us? Guenevere. We rend the holiest bond, the family. Launcelot. We but destroy the false, build up the true. Guenevere. —Think of your childhood's home, your father's hearth, Helen, your mother, at her household cares, The sacred bond from which your life began, Within whose circle boyhood grew to youth— Knit by the gentle hand of ageless custom And consecrate with immemorial rites. Launcelot. I think of this; I, too, would have a home. Guenevere. You have the world; the family alone Is woman's, it alone is her protection, Her mission and her opportunity. In it alone she lives, and she defends it, Even when its knife is in her heart. Launcelot. And I— I, too, defend it, when it is a family, As I would kneel before the sacred Host When through the still aisles sounds the sacring-bell. But if a jester strutted through the forms And turned the holy Mass into a mock, Would I still kneel, or would I rise in anger And make an end of that foul mimicry? Guenevere. Believest thou, then, the power of the Church? The Church would give our love an ugly name. Launcelot. Faith, I believe and I do not believe. The shocks of life oft startle us to thought, Rouse us from acquiescence and reveal That what we took for credence was but custom. Though the priests be the channels of God's grace, Yet otherwise they are but men; they err As others, may mistake for falsehood truth, And holiness for sin.—God help me, sweet, I cannot reason it—I only know I love you. Guenevere. You are Arthur's friend. Your love— Stands this within the honor of your friendship? Launcelot. Mother of God!—Have you no pity? Guenevere. I would I could be pitiful and yet do right. Alas, how heavy—your tears move me more Than all—(What am I saying? Dare I trust So faint a heart? I must make turning back Impossible.)—Best know the worst! I jested— I—God!—I do not love you. Go! 'T was all Mockery—wanton cruelty—what you will—lechery!— I— [Launcelot looks at her dumbly, then slowly turns to go. As he draws aside the curtains of the doorway,—] Launcelot! Launcelot. What does the Queen desire? Guenevere. Oh, no, I am not the Queen—I am your wife! Take me away with you! Let me not lie To you, of all—My whole life is a lie. To one, at least, let it be truth. I—I— O Launcelot, do you not understand?— I love you—oh, I cannot let you go. Launcelot. I pray you do not jest a second time; I scarce could bear it.—Yet your eyes speak true. Tell me you speak the truth. Guenevere. I speak the truth. Call me your wife! Launcelot. My wife, my wife, my wife! Guenevere. Love, I will fly with thee where'er thou wilt. Launcelot. Speak not of flight; I have played him false—the King, My friend. I ne'er can wipe that smirch away At least, I will not add a second shame And blazon out the insult to the world. Guenevere. What I have given thee was ne'er another's. How has another, then, been wronged? Launcelot. What's done Is done, nor right nor wrong, as help me heaven, Would I undo it if I could. But more I will not do. I will not be the Brutus To stab with mine own hand my dearest friend. It must suffice me that you love me, sweet, And sometime, somewhere, somehow must be mine. I know not—it may be some dim land Beyond the shadows, where the King himself, Still calling me his friend, shall place your hand In my hand, saying—“She was always thine.” Guenevere. I will do as thou wilt, in this and all things. But oh, the weary days! Launcelot. It is enough To know thou lovest me—sometimes, perhaps— Oh, I am but a man!—to feel as now Thy cheek against my own. Guenevere. Oh, Launcelot, Peredure is dead. Launcelot. Thy brother? Guenevere. He is dead. Launcelot. I do not wonder that you were distraught. [Shouting, etc., without.] Guenevere. It is the silly rabble that toss up Their caps for Arthur. He will soon be here,— Though a king's progress is a tedious one. [Morgause, about to enter, perceives Launcelot and Guenevere and withdraws. A slight stir of the curtain shows that she is listening.] I must go to get me ready for the pageant. Launcelot. Be not afraid. The charge that's laid against us, Cannot be certified by evidence. Guenevere. And if it were—why, then it were, and so The burden of decision were removed. Kiss me! Farewell, a little while, my love! It is a woeful world, at best. Thank God For love, even with its anguish! [Exit, through a small door back of the thrones.] Launcelot. Why, then it were! Ay, even disgrace would be an ease of breath After this tension of duplicity. God help me, I am like a man aghast Between a dragon and a basilisk, Which one he fronts dilating as he stares More horrid than the other. O mystery Of Fate, that folds us with encircling gloom! What issue sleeps for us in thy dark womb? [As he starts to go out, enter Morgause carelessly. They bow to each other. Exit Launcelot.] Morgause. So? Kissing at the very foot of the throne? What impudence! ... Why, now I have the witness Of mine own eyes to carry to the King. What, billing like two sparrows on the highway, Shameless of who may see? Oho, my birds! You are in the springe. And Mistress Eyebrows, you Shall lower a little those proud orbs of yours. Arthur can hardly doubt his sister's word, Especially when she is Queen of Orkney And Rome is knocking at his gates for tribute. But yet there's Peredure to reckon with. Oh, had I but picked up his bloody sword And plunged it in his heart before he fled! But, like an infant, I must lose my wits, To see him raging so, like a mad bull That breaks its tether in the fields, and gores The dull earth in its fury. Poor La Rouse! He's out of it. He has taken a bath this time Has frozen all the longing in his veins. Why, I was fondling him and found it sweet— And then, so cold, a coldness like damp earth Or some slow-blooded fishy creature,—pah! I was a-creep with loathing at the feel Of that limp dummy, as I dragged it out And dumped it in the fountain. So much, at least, Is done to kill the scent. But Peredure?— Will he be silent when he finds his sister Is muddied by my hands? No, he will blurt All out; and gossip virtue, like a hawk, Leaving the fluttered Queen, will change its flight And fall on the new quarry. The accusation Cannot be held back now, even if I would. 'Tis known to the whole palace. I have sailed Into a storm that bears me where it will, And all my hope is to escape the reefs. ... Devise, devise. If Peredure accuse me, As he will surely do, I will be merry, Jest of his love—I have it, I will say He would himself have won me to his will And, failing, slew La Rouse of jealousy,— But not in my apartments. I must swear La Rouse was not with me.—That will not do. Curse him, they will not doubt his word. Fie, fie! Cannot I weave a better lie than this?— 'Tis odd I have not seen the boy to-day. What if he have gone mad—that would not be So strange—or in a melancholy fit, Such as he often sullens with for trifles, Have wandered from the court? Why, there's some hope. If he but make no entrance in the scene That's on this morning—then let him come back! But, Peredure, it will be to thy—Ah, [Enter Publius.] The ambassador!—Good morrow, Publius! Publius. My duty to your Majesty. All morrows Are good when age receives the smile of beauty. Morgause. Or wisdom deigns to bow to witless youth. Publius. Your Majesty's most rancorous enemy Would not accuse her of a lack of wit. Morgause. But wit and folly ever course together. —Go to, we draw it out too thin. What think you The King will say to Rome's demand to-day? Publius. He will refuse it. He is overbold. A soldier is but a huge animal Whose brawn the statesman turns to his own ends. Morgause. To underrate the foe does not augment Our strength before, nor glory after battle. Arthur is not a horse for you to stride, And Merlin, though the King not always heeds him, Is shrewder than us all. Publius. He will refuse, Though fifty Merlins counsel. 'T is his pride That thinks itself a second Julius Cæsar. Then, with these unforeseen domestic feuds, He must do battle with enfeebled forces. And Britain is once more a Roman province. Where is La Rouse to-day? Morgause. I have not seen him. Publius. Strange! He was to communicate with me At daybreak. Morgause. The Empire's system of espionage Is very perfect, is it not? Publius. Your Majesty, It is my charge; I cannot praise myself. Morgause. I fancy, were some enemy of Rome, Some dangerous enemy, in a foreign court, Some man who knew too much, we'll say—you could Remove him, I presume, with little trouble. Publius. Were such a man in Camelot, he were dead Before the day were.—She has some one in mind. No matter; Rome can spend a dram of hemlock For such allies. Morgause. So soon as that, indeed! I see 't is well to keep in Roman favor.— Then look to it that the Prince of Cameliard Never appears again before the King. 'T is well for Rome, I tell you. We have used him And now he is incensed. He has not been About the court to-day. Publius. If he appear Too quickly, he shall perish by the knife; Else, lest we wake suspicion, he must die A natural death. Morgause. St! Finger on the lips! [Enter Merlin.] Publius. Is the King near? Merlin. He even now dismounts. Publius. I must withdraw and seek my fellow-legates. Madam, I humbly take my leave,—[apart rapidly] I give The order at once—[to Merlin] and of you, sir, most humbly. [Exit.] Merlin. I am well pleased to find the Queen of Orkney Does not forget her brother's interests, But even spreads her fascinating snares About the feet of senile enemies. Morgause. Would all of Arthur's blood were but as true! Merlin, I fear my sister, Fay Morgana, Will set her husband and the King at odds, If Rome should war upon us. Merlin. Fay Morgana Would say, “My sister is not overwise; She is so shrewd she ceases to be shrewd.” Morgause. I know my learned sister is your pupil; I never thought to match with her in craft. Merlin. Craft is no craft, when craftier is at play; Craft and no craft—and that is all I say. A woman's wit is subtle but unsure. Morgause. Why do you juggle with a senseless rhyme? Merlin. So that your wits may have a tree to climb. [Flourish without.] Morgause. At last, the King! [Enter Arthur, Guenevere, Launcelot, Godmar, Galahault, Kaye, Bors, Lionel, Ector, Gawaine, Lionors, Dagonet, Knights, Ladies, Heralds and Attendants. Flourish. The King and Queen ascend their thrones. Merlin takes the raised seat next the King. Kaye stands at the foot of the throne, attended by two Heralds.] Arthur. Fair dames and damsels, greeting! My lords and gentlemen, most noble knights Of the Round Table, greeting to you all! With wassail and rejoicing we return; For victory, like the reflected sun, Sits flashing on our helmets. Cornwall now Acknowledges our suzerainty and holds His crown in feoff. This rings the curtain down Upon the first act of our purposes. Our Trojan race, enfeebled by dependence So long upon the strong protecting swords Of Rome, our cousin and erstwhile our conqueror, And, that stout panoply and bond withdrawn, Cleft into princedoms and conflicting states, Lay, when I found it, helpless in its chaos To make a head against the Saxon raids Or to cast off the yoke of Roman tribute. Nor needed there a foreign foe; for when Each realm within the realm would be supreme, What hinders that each lordship do the like, Each barony, each village, each strong arm? Why, such a land is like a rotting corpse; For when that harmony and principle Of union, which is life, is ta'en away, And each corporeal atom works alone, The issue is corruption. The great world Should have one lord, as Britain has at last; There lies the true goal of all polity. But we, at least, are one; nor only Britain But many parts of France accept our sway. 'T is fit, at such a joyous consummation, Wrought with such toil of statecraft and of arms, To deck our city like a Queen of May With many-colored flags and summer garlands, And make the midnight sky to mock the dawn With the red gleam of bonfires on the hills. [Sits. Murmurs of applause.] What matters in our absence have arisen That need the scrutiny of the King? Proceed. [The heralds sound.] Kaye. First, dread my lord, the ambassadors from Rome. Arthur. Let them appear. [Flourish. Enter Publius and nine other Ambassadors, old men, bearing each a branch of olive. They kneel before the throne.] Publius. First for ourselves we do This reverence to your Majesty, entreating Lest we lose favor in your eyes, in that We do a graceless office. We are but cogs In the machinery of imperial Rome And work our master's will. Arthur. Rise, gentlemen, And let the throne of Britain know your message. Publius [reads]. “Lucius, the high and mighty Emperor, Sendeth to Arthur, King of Britain, greeting, Commanding thee that thou acknowledge him Thy lord, and that thou send the truage due Unto the Empire, which thy father paid And other heretofore thy predecessors, As is of record. Thou, as a false rebel, Not knowing him to be thy sovereign, Withholdest and retainest this just impost, Contrary to the statutes and decrees, Made by the noble and worthy Julius Cæsar, Conqueror of this realm and of the world, First Emperor of Rome. If thou refuse, Know thou for certain he shall make strong war On thee, thy realms and lands, and shall chastise Thee and thy subjects, making an ensample Perpetual unto all kings and princes Not to rebel against that noble empire Which domineth the universal world.” A Young Knight. Gentlemen, shall this graybeard insolence Scoff in our teeth? [Several of the younger knights draw their swords.] Arthur. Put up your swords. He dies, Who touches these old men except with reverence. Fie, would ye strike the herald in his office Or run upon unweaponed age?—Go, tell Your lord, there was a king of Britain once Who sacked great Rome itself, despite the geese Cackled to save it. As for this demand, I know no tribute that I owe to him, Nor to no earthly prince, Christian nor heathen. Say furthermore that I myself pretend In virtue of my lineal descent From that great Constantine who saw the Cross Blazoned upon the sky for his device, And conquered in that sign, who was himself A Briton, son of Helena, our Queen, And sprung from immemorial royalty— From him, I say, I trace my high descent, From him I hold the sovereignty of Britain And from him, too, the Iron Crown of Rome. And I proclaim that Lucius wears that crown As an usurper and a rebel, and Demand that he and all that are of Rome Hasten incontinent to do me homage As their true Emperor, on pain of all That shall ensue. For, rest you well assured, If I invade Italia with my chivalry, The legioned arms of Rome shall stead you little. This is my answer. But do not for this Yourselves be too impetuous of return. Abide some days in Camelot, my lords; We shall afford you merry entertainment. Publius. Your declaration puts the world at war; We may not dally in a hostile court. [Exit, with Ambassadors.] Kaye [apart]. My lord, I would have warned you of the next; But I could get no audience in the press. [Aloud, reading.] “Sir Ladinas de la Rouse, a lord of France, And Knight of the Round Table, doth impeach Guenevere, Queen of Britain, Sovran Lady Of the most Knightly and Christian Fellowship Of the Round Table, et cetera, of treason To the most gracious person of the King And to the safety of the realm, in living In shameless license with Sir Launcelot. Also he doth impeach for the same cause Sir Launcelot du Lac, the son of Ban, Lord of the land of Benwick and the castle Of Joyous Gard. This charge he undertakes To prove by evidence irrefragable, Or else to meet Sir Launcelot in the lists And whatsoever Knight beside appear To champion the quarrel of the Queen. In pledge whereof he offers to the King The disposition of his life and lands.” [Profound silence.] Launcelot. This is a grievous charge to make. But why Comes not the knight according to his bond, That I may prove his lie upon his head? Morgause. Because he has been treacherously murdered— Therefore he comes not, thou dishonored knight! Kaye. Murdered? Morgause. Ay, murdered—by Prince Peredure, The brother of the Queen! A strange concurrence! Merlin. How comes it, lady, that you know so much? Did Dagonet tell you or Sir Bors? They only, Except myself, have known of this. Be careful; With too much knowledge you undo yourself. Arthur. Enough! 'T is well, perhaps, that he is dead; Else this preposterous charge might not be passed Unquestioned and unpunished.—Is aught else—? Morgause. Oh, not so fast, my royal brother! La Rouse Cannot break through his coffin to sustain His righteous accusation; but I take That burden on myself. I shall demand Bors de Ganys, the Lady Lionors —You should believe her, she was never false To you—Prince Galahault, who knows full well What he is loth to answer, Lynette, Laurel, Dagonet, some others after, to bear witness. It is the common rumor of the palace. You cannot honorably, with that respect You owe the knights and ladies of your court, Allow yourself so shamelessly to be Misused and made a jest of. I myself Have seen Sir Launcelot and the Queen together When they conceited they were unperceived. It was but now I— Arthur. Silence! One word more And, royal and our sister though you be, Your womanhood shall be your shield no longer. Too much already have we suffered you To play the spy and weave your deft intrigues About our footing. Now our slackness ends. We banish you the court. Go, get you ready! Sir Kaye will see that, ere the sun is set, You are far hence in some sequestered castle, Where you shall have all honor, ceremony, And revenues appropriate to your state,— But nevermore be seen at Camelot! Morgause. Why, be a fool, then, and a wittol, do! And while you play the rogue in others' couches, —As you are celebrated for that sport,— Your dearest friend shall get the realm its heir. God punishes your wantonness right fitly, You prince of lechers and of perjurers! You, flower of chivalry! Ay, for chivalry Means truth to men, if they are stout enough, And flattering falsehood to a woman's ear. Murder and lust are the two spurs of knighthood, Which stains a Lionors and stabs La Rouse! —Proud harlot, I shall see your downfall yet. [Exit, followed by Kaye.] Arthur. My Launcelot, sit thou by my Queen. My lords, This is my friend—through good or ill report My friend. Who injures him by word or deed, Were it but the thin film of an idle breath Clouding the clear glass of his stainless soul, He injures me; and but that I am King And may not, being the State more than myself, Joust like a simple knight, and but that he, Our stoutest arm as our most knightly heart, Needs not my lance to right him, I would slay With mine own hands the knave that did him wrong. [Turns to Guenevere, who rises.] And thou, my noble Queen!—If that I ever By so much as the sullying of a thought Dimmed the bright clarity of thine imaged whiteness Within my soul, may Christ remember it Against me at the Judgment! [Advances and kisses her, then turns to the others.] Good my lords, Erase this most unnecessary scene From your remembrance. Launcelot [half aside, partly to Guenevere and partly to himself]. Be less kingly, Arthur, Or you will split my heart!—not with remorse— No, not remorse, only eternal pain!— Why, so the damned are! Guenevere [half apart]. To the souls in hell It is at least permitted to cry out. Curtain. III. THE BIRTH OF GALAHAD A ROMANTIC DRAMA PERSONS. Arthur, King of Britain. Launcelot, his General. Galahault, his General.

Beds of the earlier vegetables, such as lettuce, cabbages, young onions, and radishes, mingled with primroses and daffodils, and other early flowers. Some of the beds covered with straw, which Dame Brisen and Dagonet are busy removing, to expose them to the warmth of the sunny spring morning. The garden walks lead back to a doorway in a small castle, where a plum-tree in full blossom is trained against the castle walls. In another part, a shrine, with an image of the Virgin. The garden is encompassed by a wall, parts of which are in view; and through a gate in this wall the ocean is seen in the distance. On the other side of the gate from the castle, a turret with a spiral stair is built against the wall, overtopping it and looking on the sea. Dame Brisen (crooning). Old and bent and a bag of bones! Kisses for maidens, kicks for crones! But never so bonny and brisk a bride In the dark of the moon when the demons ride! Dagonet. “Demons” and “the dark of the moon”—Oh, Lord! Let 's think of something cheerful. (Sings.) The King sat down to a venison pasty, Burned his mouth because he was hasty— [Breaks off and looks at Dame Brisen quissically.] Dame Brisen (crooning). Mandrake and martagan! A goodly brew For the— [The rest is lost in a mutter.] Dagonet. Ugh! Who would think she was but gathering herbs for a pottage? ... Dame Brisen, the country folk say you are a witch. Dame Brisen. Witch enough to bewilder them, Dagonet. Gather you your strawberries, and meddle not with an old woman's whims. Weed the patch as you go. Dagonet. That ever I should come to be a puller of weeds! Dame Brisen. You are wrong to say so. Would you have a common kern here, to be a partaker of the Queen's secret? [Dagonet drops his basket, springs lightly up into the turret, glances rapidly over the wall, and up and down the road, and lightly leaps back into the garden.] Dagonet. The Queen has no secret,—with a wall but a rod away, and whoever you please passing behind it. Dame Brisen. Well, well. Dagonet. Besides, if we keep up the trick to each other, we shall lie with the better grace to the world. We shall have no superfluous habit of the truth to forget. So let it be your lady, the Princess Ylen, even between us, and no word of secrets or the Queen! Old Merlin has a nose like an elephant, and can smell a thought from here to Camelot, before you have spoken it. Dame Brisen. Nay, you can tell me naught of Merlin. In the old days—But the sap 's out o' that long ago ... Dagonet. When will the child be born? Dame Brisen. Under the next moon. Dagonet. And when did the Princess' husband die? When a man is to have a posthumous heir, he can't be too careful of the date of his death. Dame Brisen. It was nigh on Michaelmas of last year the Prince died. Dagonet (counting on his fingers). Oh, that I had given myself in my youth to the mathematics! Dame Brisen. Tangle your brains no more about it. The child will pass for his ... I cannot keep from thinking of the Queen and the Princess in their childhood. You remember them. Dagonet. As well as I remember my first top. I spun it and they spun me. ... Oh, the Virgin! Dame Brisen. What now? Dagonet. I have put all the weeds into the basket with the strawberries. God never meant me to be a clodhopper. [Runs up again into the turret, where he sits twirling his bauble, and looking out idly over the wall.] Dame Brisen. I saw them both born. They are within three months of an age. The kingdoms of their fathers lay side by side; that was before King Arthur had made all the kingdoms into one. There were Druids still in the fastnesses in those days. Dagonet. Yonder 's a horseman far down the road. He rides too fast for a clown. Dame Brisen. By the mistletoe, but they were a pair of madcap little queenlets! Untamed as young hawks— Dagonet. And inseparable as bread and butter. Dame Brisen. When the lady Guenevere was not at the court of our good King Pelles, then was the lady Ylen with your mistress at Cameliard. They would have it no other way. And it was ever Guenevere that led in the adventure, and it was ever Ylen that led in the escape. Enter Ylen. She stands for an instant in the doorway, and then comes slowly down the walks, plucking primroses. She pays no heed to the others, and they do not perceive her. Dagonet. Yonder horseman wears the King's livery; perhaps he brings news from the armies. Dame Brisen. Nay, but that would gladden the heart of Guenevere. Day long she frets for tidings of the war. Dagonet. Not the war so much as the warrior. Dame Brisen. Since the King crossed the waters with his knights, you would say the sea rolled between her and her peace. Dagonet. He'll never keep up that pace when he gets to the foot of the hill. I'll down to meet him. [Leaps over the wall and disappears.] Dame Brisen. And leave me to finish your work for you, vagabond. [As she rises and turns, with her basket in one hand and Dagonet's in the other, she meets Ylen.] Good morrow, my lady. Ylen. Good morrow, Brisen. What a day of spring! The wind comes with a touch so like a kiss I almost blush and startle; and the knit sense Opens like a flower in the warm air. Go call the Queen; this will revive her more Than all the service of a score of us. Dame Brisen. Ay, madam, she stifles, shut indoor. Ylen. What chiefly Lays waste her spirit is the barren longing To look on Launcelot. But to hear his name, She will hang upon your words like a great bee. She swears, when all is done, she will not stay One hour ere she set out to join him. Dame Brisen. Well, She has not so long to wait as she has waited. Ylen. Yes, I shall soon have a child ... by proxy. I wonder Will it be boy or girl. [Exit Dame Brisen. Ylen wanders about the garden idly, singing.] And if he should come again In the old glad way, I should smile and take his hand. What were there to say? [Pauses with her face against the gate, looking out over the sea.] I should close my eyes and smile, And my soul would be Like the peace of summer noons Beside the sea. Enter Guenevere, from the castle. A pause. Guenevere. My heart is with the sailors on that bark, Far out to sea, whose sails shine like a star, Bound for the south—oh, to be free! to stab This turnkey Policy, break prison, flee, Untrammelled, fearless, irresponsible— And let tongues wag that will! Ylen. The place is pleasant. Since needs must we be prisoners, methinks Our jail no hardship. Guenevere. Oh, were Launcelot here, I could content me, were 't a hermitage, And think myself the mistress of a world. Ylen. And I, whose lord and lover bivouacs By camp-fires whence no tidings ever come, With the unreturning armies of the dead, What bird of all the heaven could lend me wings Would serve me? So I grow content, perhaps, With all too little, seeing that what I would Is more than mortal can. Guenevere. Forgive me! My loss is loud and fretful, and forgets Your deeper, dumb, irrevocable grief. You are my savior: you have all been kind, Gentle and true, Sir Tristram when he lent This bower to us, and your Brisen, too, And Dagonet—a good world, after all, That has such hearts in it! Oh, Ylen, Ylen! I think there never was so good a woman— Ylen (sings). “We two have wandered on the hills And braved the winds together.” Oh, dear my Guenevere, is it so much That we should just be friends? And what's a friend That does not feel a joy that friendship needs The will made deed to lean on? Guenevere. Such a friend Is oftener dreamed than real. Ylen. Nor is this So hard a thing I do. For, sooth, I need Something to love—nay, were it but a bird. My lord is not; you grow away from me In the great world I have no heart to enter; My father dreams of Graals and mystic visions, And nears the end. I never had a child. And I begin to long for yours as if I were indeed its mother. Guenevere. Ah, but ... You do not know the mystery of it all; A life within your life—a part of you And yet not you—a soul—think, Ylen, think— A soul, a spark struck from divinity, And caught in you as tow to smoulder in Until the free air fan it to a flame— Shut, as the Host is in the tabernacle, Within you—Oh, it makes a sanctuary Of every inch of you, a temple where The soul is priest and may not leave the altar One instant! The whole earth is hushed and chancelled. Out of the shadow of the brooding presence No escape anywhere—ocean, sky, air, filled With the universal awe. I live in awe. I am become a wonder to myself, A place inhabited by secret powers, A wilderness wherein I wander, lost, Among dim, alien shapes, forgotten gods, That work out their uncomprehended aims And ask no leave of me. Dagonet (without). Ho, there! News! Guenevere. What now? Ylen. It is the fool. Enter Dagonet and a Messenger. Dagonet. A messenger from the Court, your Majesty. Guenevere. What news? Dagonet. A caskful at the least. Broach, broach! We are all dry as Saracens. I could drink the stalest small beer of court gossip with a relish. A mad jest would be sack to me. Any old news! We that live in the country— Guenevere. Peace, Fool; it is his cue. Messenger. First, madam, Merlin Greets you with health and loyal salutation. Bidding you have no care of things of state, Seeing the matters of your regency, Whereof he is the minister, continue Smoothly and fair. What else imports you know With more detail, you may at your good leisure O'erread in these. [Giving packet.] Guenevere. No tidings of the wars? Messenger. A post from France brings word the King has met The Romans at the Loire and vanquished them; The happy issue of the day being due Chiefly to Launcelot. Guenevere. Ay, what of him? Messenger. He was the first knight in the world before, But now he hath no rival. Madam, a poet Should tell his deeds, not I, who have no language To parallel his action. His appearance Made the ranks break before him; they that stayed, Like stubborn oaks, were blasted with the shock Of his great battle-axe, which played like lightning, Here, there, now at the centre, now the flanks, Cracking the cloud of war. Guenevere. Methinks I see him!— Ylen. Madam, be calm ... What of the others? Messenger. Alas! Sir Godmar, the Lord Marshal, that old soldier, Who hath commanded since King Uther's time, Is slain. At that the field was almost lost, And had been, but for Launcelot, whose coming Made them whose courage failed at Godmar's fall Take heart again and conquer. Save for this, No loss of note except Sir Dinadan Who is made prisoner. Ylen. What, Dinadan? The merry Dinadan? A sorry jest. Messenger. The Romans have retreated to the Rhone, Whither our armies follow. For his prowess The King has named Sir Launcelot general In Godmar's place. Guenevere. Why, then, he has command Of all the armies! Messenger. Ay, madam, next the King. Ylen. You bring good news. But we forget your journey. Dagonet, look you to his entertainment. Dagonet. Now it's my turn ... Shall we go in? ... What's the last mad prank on the Severn? Who has made Sir Kaye ridiculous? Or no, God made him that. Which of the maids of honor—now the cat 's away the— Messenger. One more commission. Merlin prays the Queen To read this scroll. [Bows and exit with Dagonet.] Guenevere. Oh! ... Fate waits upon his will. No enterprise So hopeless, be it in peace or be it in war, But his adhesion sureties its success! Ylen. Holá! Holá! Guenevere. But to be fellows with him Makes lesser men invincible. Ylen. How Tristram Will chafe that he must rest inglorious here While such brave deeds are doing! Guenevere. Launcelot Holds him his only peer; but the heavens fight With Launcelot! Ylen. And to Tristram they are dark; As now when he must stay and serve King Mark. Guenevere. The more is Launcelot's glory that alone He is sufficient. Oh, it is strange That one, the gentlest heart in all the world, Should be so mighty and so terrible. Ylen. What is more gentle than the delicate air? And yet its storms uproot the rugged oak. And what is softer than the yielding wave? Yet floods and tempests lurk there. What more kindly Than the warm fire, which, being unleashed, devours A city or a forest in a night? ... I pray you, read the scroll that Merlin sent. I am curious. Guenevere. What mystery is this? A riddle—for the harp. Ylen. Nay, read it out. Guenevere (reads). “Three things are hard to follow; The flight of a gull in the mist, A trail in running water, And the secret of a woman. “Three things it is useless to baffle; The rise of the tide, The courses of the stars, And the thought in the heart of a woman. “Three things are a witness how vain is the craft of man; The might of the sea in storm, The silences of the night, And the birth of a child. “I, Merlin, am old; I have seen many things; But one thing have I not seen, That taking counsel prevailed against days or doom Or the desire of a woman. “The stars in the sky have said me a rune; The leaves rustled with knowledge, The air trembled with tidings; I was aware of a dream in the darkness. “He that is mightier than his father, yet not so mighty; He that is wiser than his father, yet not so wise; He that is holier than his father, yet not so holy; Such an one stood before me in the night. “A lily is known by three things; It is white and a maiden, Its odors are elfin music in the garden, But no fruit comes of it.” He knows. Ylen. How can he know? Guenevere. He knows, he knows. Ylen. Nay, perhaps he but spreads a snare for you. Guenevere. He has strange power to see men's hidden souls. His look can make your thoughts startle and shrink Like naked things. Ylen. Let me look at the scroll ... It's partly pat and partly in the air; Words, words; or I am dull. Guenevere. No, no; he clouds His meaning in a mystery. That's his way ... The worst is, to do nothing ... What he knows He knows. What he will do, he will do. And there's No help but silence and to wait the event. [The scene closes. Scene II. In the Valley of the Rhone. The Camp. Before the Tent of Launcelot. Lionel and Ector, playing at dice, Bors, and Varro, a prisoner. Ector. I'll play no more. The Devil is on your side. Lionel. As you will, cousin. ... Will you lay a wager, sir? Varro. You mock me. I am a prisoner, disfurnished Of aught to play with, and, till I am ransomed, Cut off from my estate. Lionel. O sir, your word Is good enough for me to gamble with. Bors. Think not so meanly of us, as that we Should jest at a brave foeman overthrown. We would forget you are our prisoner And have you too forget it. Lionel. If you lose, I'll rest your creditor till you are free. Varro. Why then I take your offer heartily; And, win or lose, I am your debtor still For courtesy. ... A hundred sesterces! Lionel. Deuces. Varro. Eleven. Lionel. Yours. Varro. Again. ... the same. Lionel. Quits. Varro. Double. Lionel. Mine. Varro. Three hundred. Lionel. Mine again. Varro. A thousand sesterces against your chestnut! Lionel. That's twice her value. Done. Varro. A double six. Lionel. The mare is yours. Ector. Look! By the Holy Cross, There 's Dinadan. Bors. Where? Ector. Yonder, with Launcelot. Lionel. What, Dinadan back again? Ho, Dinadan! Enter Launcelot and Dinadan. Ector. How 'scaped you? Bors. Welcome to the camp again! Dinadan. Oh, comrades! Varro. What a fellowship these knights are! Dinadan. O Lord, O Lord! I am bruised from head to foot. First, I am sore with sleeping in the prison— They have villainous prisons in these Roman towns— Next, sore with riding the jade that brought me hither— She had a backbone like the Alps—and last, Sorest of all with the crack you have given my ribs. Bors. Why, welcome, then! Dinadan. Oh, Bors, be pitiful! Launcelot. Varro, I have found you a true man, and I Am glad and loth to set you free. But go; You are the ransom of Sir Dinadan; I have exchanged you for him. They that brought him Wait to conduct you back with them. Good bye! Lionel. What, free so soon? Come, we must find your mare. Ector. I'll go along with you. Varro. Sir Launcelot, If e'er my arm can do you service, saving My loyalty to Cæsar ... count on me. Launcelot. I do believe you. I do know your worth. Varro. I thank you all. Farewell. Sir Lionel, I owe you some five hundred sesterces. Will you be patient till I send them to you, Or will you take the mare again in payment? Lionel. No, keep the brute, that you may not forget us; And I'll collect the sesterces in Rome. Varro. It will be long before your armies sit Beneath the walls of Rome. But thanks again. I shall not soon forget you. By the gods, Were Rome and Britain not at war, I 'd hold No honor half so dear as to be one Of your great fellowship—this same Round Table You tell me of. By Hercules, you are men. Farewell! [Exeunt Varro, Lionel, and Ector. Bors. A valiant pagan, with a touch Of the old Roman virtue in him yet. I hold him nearer heaven, with his plain honesty, Than all the Christian Romans I have seen. Dinadan. Pagan or Christian, hang 'em all, I say. I would not treat a pig as they did me. Bors. There still are not a few among the Romans Who, like our Varro, hold to the antique gods, But they resemble him in nothing else. The rest are Christians more by politics Than faith and living; and, for the most part now, To be a Roman is to be made up Of falsehood, idleness and incontinence. Dinadan. Treachery and lechery stirred about together Like a bad pudding. Enter Galahault. Galahault. What, Sir Dinadan! Dinadan. At your commands, Sir Galahault, I pray you, Assign me a post of danger in the rear. I have a great desire to lead an attack On the commissariat. Galahault. Why, so you shall. For that you 're captain. Bors. We'll take leave of you. We were just going to my tent. Galahault. I take it Sir Dinadan needs rest. I'll not detain you. Bors. The generals would confer together. Come. [Exeunt Bors and Dinadan.] Galahault. It nears the hour the King appointed us To hold our council. Shall we go together? Launcelot. The daily torture! ... To hear his voice! To look into his eyes ... His honest, outward eyes ... and read the love there I have betrayed! ... Oh, Galahault, you know, You know, you know; and you must hear me speak— Or I must find a desert and rip out My passion to the winds. Galahault. Had I been silent, Love would have found a way. I did not count. And yet so little as I counted, Launcelot, I reckon it as one of my good deeds. Launcelot. I will not yield her. No, by heaven, she 's mine, And by a higher title than the King's. I cannot yield her; she 's not mine to yield. Love is not goods or gold to be passed on From hand to hand; it is like life itself, One with its owner,—pluck it out to give Another and by that act it is destroyed And no one richer for your bankruptcy. Yet if we do no wrong, what 's there to hide, And why must we shift out our lives in lies? When Arthur puts his arm about my neck And tells me his imperial dreams, how he Will shape this world, when he has mastered it, To something worthier man's immortal soul, Keeping back nothing of his heart from me— Oh, Galahault, think how I love the man And how my heart must choke with its deceit! It were less miserable to confess to him— But that were tenfold more disloyalty To Guenevere than loyalty to him. Disloyalty! Oh, God, were I to break My promise to a slave, I 'd hold myself A paltry and dishonored thing; and yet Whichever way I turn, disloyalty Yawns like a chasm before me. True is false, And false is true; and everything that is, A mocking contradiction of itself. I am lost in lies, and must lie on—to him! ... At least I'll serve him in his dream of empire— There lies his heart. I have fought in this campaign Triple myself! There is no peace for me But to achieve impossibilities— Then, all 's too little. Galahault. Would I had the tithe Of such a passion! So are great deeds done. To have the power to feel go out of you, That is the worst. I have a workman's pleasure In my own skill, 't is true; but all 's for what? I have no reason to do anything; Would die, but have no reason for that, neither. You love the Queen, too—What a reason 's there! Launcelot. Would suffer hell to love her, as indeed I suffer hell—but love her! I am content. I have chosen. ... We must go. I must endure To look into the eyes of my best friend And live a lie to him. ... God, to be in Rome! To set the Cæsars' crown upon his head! To make it up to him! ... Well, come. [Exeunt.] Scene III. The same as Scene I. The spring is more advanced, and the later flowers, lilies especially, have appeared. Some lilies are set in a vase before the shrine of the Virgin. Dagonet is arranging a couch in the garden. Enter Dame Brisen with her arms full of cushions and coverings. Dame Brisen. I have been midwife these two and forty years, but never yet saw I woman out of her bed, not to say out of doors, the third day after the child was born. It is against all precedent. But she is that stubborn, you might as well argue with Tintagel. Dagonet. Fast asleep. How antique he looks for only two days old! Dame Brisen. Ay, this is the third day. He was born on Easter Sunday, of all days in the world. Have you spoken to the fathers at the Abbey concerning his christening? 'T is for to-day. Dagonet. Yes, yes. They have gone forth in procession to bless the fields. When they return, at vespers, you 're expected. The abbey will furnish proxies for the sponsors. This seems to be all done by proxy. I wonder the youngster did not appear by attorney himself. Dame Brisen. To take the air in the garden! Is she wiser than all the women since Eve? I wash my hands of the consequences. Dagonet. Now, to look at the two of us, who would think that this was a monster of iniquity, not yet washed from his sins, and I one of the saints, clean as a fresh laundered shirt, absolved o' Saturday, communicated o' Sunday, and not having had a chance to commit any sins since? Dame Brisen. There, the couch is ready. Mass, I'll not have my fine frock on in time for the christening. [Going.] Enter Ylen and Guenevere. Guenevere (comes down from the castle with Ylen, and sinks on the couch). ... Oh, why should we bring forth Children in weakness, not in strength? Why not Be free and mighty, bearing mighty men, Yielding our increase as the teeming Earth That faints not—nay, rather exults and splurges In her fecundity? Ylen. Well, by St. Anne, Was never woman had less cause than thou To rail against the curse. Guenevere. I am not bedrid; But yet I am too trammelled for my will, Which would be in the clouds with yonder hawk And swoop to its desire. Dame Brisen. Madam, what name Will you have given the child? Guenevere. Bring him to me. Dame Brisen. He is asleep; I would not wake him, madam, Until it rings for vespers. Guenevere. Let me turn, then, So I can see him. ... “Wrapped in swaddling clothes.” ... He shall be christened Galahad. Dame Brisen. A fair name. Ylen. Why do you choose it? Guenevere. I would have him like His father, even in name. Did you not know That Launcelot was first named Galahad? Ylen. No, sooth. Guenevere. Yes, he was christened so; and after Confirmed and knighted Launcelot of the Lake. Ylen. Go, get you ready, Brisen. ... Galahad! [Exit Dame Brisen.] Guenevere. Dagonet, you must post from hence to-night,— And be you swifter than the hunted fox! I will not give you letters. Be your memory My parchment. When you come to Launcelot, Say I am coming—Were my wish my coach, I should be there before you. But I fear I shall not speed it with a courier. Therefore, I send you first; for every day That he is ignorant, is a day forgotten. I would my thoughts were arrows to outspeed The swallow to him! ... Tell him, he has a son. —My lips are jealous of the word. Oh, how Can I let any but myself declare The wonder to him? ... Fetch me ink and paper. I will write. You shall bear a letter to him. Dagonet (going). If I had the heels of your will, it would be a quick journey. [Sings.] For stocks and stones are whirled about With Earth and never range; And he who never changed his mind, Must have no mind to change. Ri fol de riddle rol. [Exit.] Ylen. Look where the slow procession of the monks Crawls through the fields. Guenevere. It lies along the downs, Like a long line of seaweed on the surge. Ylen. They are turning homeward. Guenevere. Now I look at them, I almost fancy I can hear their chanting. Ylen. That 's a sharp ear. Guenevere. Nay, surely I can hear them. Re-enter Dagonet, with pens, ink, and paper, which he arranges by Guenevere's side on a table. Monks (chanting, far off, very faintly). Sicut erat in principio, et nunc, et semper ? et in sæcula sæculorum. Amen. Guenevere. I will not write ... Tell him ... tell him ... Now what Can he be told by any messenger? Be letter perfect and there 's something gone That was the real message. ... I will write. [Writes.] Monks (without, nearer). ... exitus matutini et vespere delectabis. Visitasti terram, et inebriasti eam ? multiplicasti locupletare eam. Flumen Dei repletum est aquis, parasti cibum illorum ? quoniam ita est præparatio ejus. Rivos ejus inebria, multiplica genimina ejus ? in stillicidiis ejus lætabitur germinans. Benedices coronæ anni benignitatis tuæ ? et campi tui replebuntur ubertate. Pinguescent speciosa deserti ? et exultatione colles accingentur. Induti sunt arietes ovium, et valles abundabunt frumento ? clamabunt, etenim hymnum dicent. Gloria Patri, et Filio ? et Spiritui Sancto; Sicut erat in principio, et nunc, et semper ? et in sæcula sæculorum. Amen. [With the Gloria the procession of monks begins to come in sight. First, one with a banner bearing the device of a lion; next, one with a banner bearing the device of a dragon; then follow the lay brothers, in the brown habits of the order; then the priests, who wear surplices over their cowls; lastly, the abbot, in cope and mitre, preceded by an acolyte carrying a cross. As the first monk, with the banner of the lion, passes, Guenevere, having written her letter and sealed it, turns to Dagonet, who is looking at the monks. Ylen sits with Guenevere on the couch, and the three watch the procession silently, until it has passed.] Domini est terra, et plenitudo ejus ? orbis terrarum, et universi qui habitant in eo. Quia ipse super maria fundavit eum ? et super flumina præparavit eum. Quis ascendet in montem Domini ? aut quis stabit in loco sancto ejus? Innocens manibus, et mundo corde ? qui non accepit in [The procession passes out of sight.] vano animam suam, nec juravit in dolo proximo suo. Hic accipiet benedictionem a Domino ... Guenevere. Here is the letter. Guard it with thy life. Dagonet (Taking letter). Better yet, with my wits, and with my heels. I will go in and furnish myself for the journey. Fare you well, madam. Fare you well, my liege. Now to see the world. [Exit.] Enter Dame Brisen, hurriedly. Dame Brisen. It is nigh on the hour. I shall be late. The fathers are already—... [She is about to take up the child in her arms, and suddenly breaks off speaking. The others, startled, look up, and, following her gaze, perceive Merlin standing in the gate. Guenevere rises, but Ylen remains seated on the couch.] Monks (without, in the distance). Quis est iste Rex gloriæ? ? Dominus virtutum ipse est Rex gloriæ. Enter Merlin. Ylen. You are welcome, Merlin. That I do not rise, My sickness must excuse. Will you go in? Or shall our Brisen bring us cakes and wine Here in the garden? Merlin. Madam, bravely played. But you, O Queen, why do you rise and stand Alert, with quivering nostril? Sit you down, And have no fear of me. Guenevere. I fear you not. Merlin. The labor to play out your comedy Is much ado for nothing. I'll be plain. (To Ylen.) You, who are childless, must not seem to be; (To Guenevere.) And you, who are not childless, must be thought so. And so your riddle is reed. Now drop your masks. Why feign deceit, since I am not deceived? Guenevere. Nay, then, you know. (Sinking on couch.) God knows I love not masks. It is a bitter thing to lie—to hide As if you were ashamed of what you lived! I tell thee, Merlin, I am proud of it,— Proud of my love, proud of my lover, proud— Ay, prouder of my child than of my crown! I would I could go out into the streets And show him with a boast. I would the world Might know how much to envy is my joy! And I must lie—like some poor penny thief That thinks to 'scape a flogging; I must lie, Like a base mind that dares not let its thoughts Out-doors, lest it be seen how vile they are. It doth unburden me to speak at last And not degrade myself. You know the truth. What will you do? I must know what's to be— The worst!—or best. ... And yet I do not know What I hold worst or best. ... What will you do? Merlin. Nothing. Guenevere. Nothing? Merlin. Nothing. I judge you not. I am very old; men call me very wise; But neither in the codes the Romans brought us, Nor in the teaching of the Christian monks, Nor in the stars, nor in the crucible, No, nor in those dark elder mysteries The immemorial Druidic years Down the dim arches of the woods of Time Have whispered to each other, in the aloof And native shades of Britain, which are now A vague tradition of the rustling oak; Not in all these, nor in all-testing Life That heeds not our conclusions, have I found That there is any wisdom beyond this, To keep oneself from judgment. In myself Are undiscovered countries; how should I Map out the wildernesses in another? In those uncharted regions of your soul, There are events of which you never dreamed That yet have drawn your whole life after them. I have to do only with how your deeds Affect the State. And it imports the State That what you have concealed should be concealed. And therefore have I sought you, that it may The better be concealed and that we cross not Each other's purposes. [The bells of the abbey begin to ring in the distance; and they continue ringing until the end of the scene.] Dame Brisen. It rings for vespers. Shall I not hasten, madam? Guenevere. You may go. Merlin. Wait. Let me see the child. ... If I mistake not, We two have stood beneath the sacred oak Together. You were young and very fair ... Dame Brisen. I was that Druid priestess. Merlin. And since then Men say that you have witnessed darker rites. Dame Brisen. Men say they know not what. Merlin. But you are she, That Brisen whom I mean. Dame Brisen. I am that Brisen. Merlin. The sight is on me. I behold this child Grown to a man; the armor that he bears Is silvern pale; he stands among the knights Like a white birch among grim-visaged pines; He is like a moon-lit pillar in the night; And angels float unseen above his head, Bearing the Holy Graal. Guenevere. The Holy Graal! Merlin. Ay, this is he that shall achieve the Graal; Whose birth has been foretold in prophecies Even since King Evelac's time. This is the man Of whom the seers have spoken, saying: He Shall be a knight without a peer, stainless, A virgin, set apart unto the Lord. His arm shall be like David's, and his sword Like Michael's when he leads the seraphim. None shall withstand him; the immaterial Fiend Dare not affront the flame along his blade. So he shall pass across the twilight world Like a white meteor and disappear None knoweth how nor whither. Guenevere. Strange and holy I know he is. In the still hours I have heard The footfalls of celestial visitants. Strange spells have come upon me. And I Who am not wont to pray, have felt my soul Become a phraseless prayer and lie, like night, Bare to the stars. ... God, is it no sacrifice I lay upon thy dark and shadowy altar? Never to call him son, never to feel His little arms about my neck, never To hear his wakening spirit turn to mine Its dear unfolding loves ... and now, even now To leave him! ... I shall watch him from afar; His glory will be trumpets in my heart; But the great gulfs of silence are between us. You dark remorseless creditors that exact Our debts with usury, is it not enough? ... Curtain. [The bells continue to ring a few moments after the curtain falls.] ACT II. Scene. The top of a hill, north of Rome and west of the Tiber. Over the brink of the hill, a view of the valley of the Tiber with Rome in the distance. King Arthur, Launcelot, Lionel, Ector, and Dinadan, on horseback, attended by two Squires. King Arthur and Launcelot, a little apart from the others, converse, looking off at the city. Arthur. So order it. Launcelot. Lionel, get you back To the main army. Order Galahault To move his forces southward and encamp Before Janiculum. His function there Is by activity, assault, bravado, To keep the enemy's eyes on him—and therefore Away from us. The main part of the forces Do you yourself bring forward; pitch their tents Here to the west, so ordered that they seem Following on Galahault's trail. You, Ector, haste To join the advance, which must be on our heels, And lead them hither. We shall occupy This hill and the approach. The King and I Will pitch our tents here on the summit. Dinadan, You will remain; we may have need of you. [Exeunt Lionel and Ector. Launcelot and Dinadan dismount and their horses are led off by a Squire. The other Squire approaches Arthur, still looking at the city, and after he too has dismounted, leads his horse away after the others.] Arthur. If Galahault can hold the foe in action Before Janiculum, it will be easy To cross our forces to the eastern bank Almost without resistance. In great part, Their legions have already fallen back. Launcelot. But yet they still are in great numbers there Between the Tiber and the Flaminian Gate. Dinadan. That's the first Roman standard I have seen In Italy. Our progress from the Rhone Has been a Maying rather than a war. Arthur. 'T was no such holidaying at the start. You were in Britain at the worst. The war Was six months old before you reached the camp. Dinadan. Not by my fault, my lord. Arthur. I said not so. But thus it happened that you have not seen How these same Romans fight. Six months they held us North of the Loire. But our last victories (Wherein you played your part, Sir Dinadan), Were like a flood, bursting the sturdy dam That had so long resisted. Their great army Crumbled to pieces like a fog. Perforce, They must fall back on Rome, renew themselves, And leave our march unhindered. Dinadan. I am glad You sent for me no sooner. I confess This is the kind of war that pleases me. Arthur. Oh, no more ease; there are the walls of Rome. It will be bloody work before we take them. You shall be in the front. Dinadan. The devil I will! ... Why must you send for me and not for Tristram To bring your reinforcements? I was content At Camelot ... and no great gain, besides; While Tristram! ... after Launcelot the best Among your knights! ... Arthur. Therefore he is in Britain. Were all my bravest here, it would invite Revolt among the unreconciled at home. Especially I trust not Mark of Cornwall. Dinadan. Lucky Tristram! Would I might change lots with him ... Yseult and all! Arthur. What's Yseult? Dinadan. Not heard yet Of Yseult, Irish Yseult, Yseult the Fair, And what men say of Tristram and of her? Arthur. I have heard the King of Ireland has a daughter, Whose beauty some have praised with Guenevere's; But not a word of Tristram. Dinadan (to Launcelot). My lord the King Takes little heed of such light things as these; But you have heard the tale. Launcelot. I have heard nothing. Dinadan. Why, you poor exiles! All Britain whispers of it, And Ireland too. It is the latest secret That everybody keeps. Has not the rumor Yet reached the camp? It fell upon this wise —Or so the story goes—King Mark of Cornwall, Although Sir Tristram is his sister's son, Hates him that, having done you homage, sire, And sworn to keep the faith of the Round Table, He would not join him in his late revolt. Casting about what way to do him ill And 'scape your wrath, no sooner were you gone, Than Mark sends Tristram into Ireland (where The very hounds were hungry for revenge On him that slew their masters) to demand In Mark's behalf the Princess Yseult's hand. Arthur. The treacherous coward! Dinadan. The plot failed; for Tristram Came in the nick of time to save the king From something,—I forget just what it was— But anyhow, all enmity wiped out, The Irish welcomed Tristram like a brother, Feasted him like a prince and sent him back To Cornwall rich with gifts; and Yseult with him, To be the Queen of Cornwall and Mark's wife. Arthur. Too vile a traitor to be so rewarded! Dinadan. Well, as for that ... wait till you hear the end. ... Perhaps he was rewarded. This is what They say; that the Queen Mother brewed a drink Of such enchantment that whoever drank it Should from that moment sink so deep in love Drowning is nothing to it. This she did That Yseult and King Mark might drink together And no division ever sunder them; Then gave the cup to Yseult's handmaiden Brangwain, to give them on their wedding night. But Yseult knew not of it; so it came That as they sailed toward Cornwall, on a day, Tristram being hot and thirsty, Yseult sought A draught for him and found Brangwain asleep And the cup by her; and they two drank thereof And straightway loved each other. Arthur. Think you it true? Dinadan. Why, for the potion, be that as it may. I hold it likely Tristram drank some wine, And not unlikely that he kissed the lady; And all, perhaps, without the devil's help. Arthur. Fair fall their loves; he is a worthy knight. Launcelot (aside). What, Arthur! Dinadan. On the wedding night, they say, Yseult would have no lights, for modesty; And in the dark Brangwain went to King Mark, And Yseult—did not miss him. Launcelot. Oh, oh, oh! Arthur (leaving Dinadan and going over to Launcelot). Launcelot ... Now, fie, fie! Be merry, man. The old rogue is well served. ... It troubles me That you have grown so moody and apart Of late. That ribald slander of Morgause Against you and the Queen has poisoned all The joy of life in you. Since then you are changed; You smile not; and especially I note That all light words of gallantry offend you. Tut, let them flinch that have uneasy souls. Launcelot. They have grown senseless of the sting with use. Arthur. Were every flippant speech considered deeply, Life would become unintermitting thorns. ... Now as you love me! Launcelot. As I love you, Arthur,— Dinadan. My liege! Launcelot! Quick, to horse! Look yonder! The Romans! Arthur. Where? Away; we shall be taken. Launcelot. Why is not Ector here? Arthur. Away! Dinadan. To horse! [Exeunt. Gallop without.] Enter Dagonet, by another path. Dagonet. This is the place, but where are the knights? I was told when I came up with the army, that I should find Sir Launcelot on the crest of this hill. Well, here is the crest, and that's the nearest to knighthood I can see; the only devices here are those I am left to. I shall never dare be drunk, turn a handspring, woo a lass nor let my tongue wag o' Sundays, till I have delivered this letter. I might as well not be a Fool. This is the place, sure; yonder's Rome—the Eternal City. Well, well; now I have seen Rome. I suppose there are a great many about here could say the same thing. ... Ha! I don't know what a Roman soldier looks like, but I can guess near enough to run. [Going.] Enter Roman Soldiers. Soldiers. A prize! a prize! [Dagonet is taken.] Enter Varro, Linus, and more Soldiers. Varro (speaking off). Hold all the passes, and send forward scouts To see how near the enemy approaches. ... (To Linus.) These orders are to hold this place until More troops are sent to join us. It would seem As if the Emperor had changed his plan And meant to cross the Tiber. ... What is this? Linus. A parrot, by his plumage. Varro. On my word, This is the queerest capture ever I saw. What are you, fellow? Dagonet. Earth, air, water, and fire—according to the opinion of the most learned philosophers. Varro. What? Dagonet. Man, sir, is thus compounded.—Earth and water is mud; mud and fire is pottery; and what are we all but jugs, with a breath of life added? Varro. What are you babbling? Come, sirrah, a plain answer; who are you? Dagonet. One of the children of the wind. Our father blows whither he listeth, and we follow the trail of his patrins. But indeed, sir, to speak plainly, I am a juggler. Varro. Search him. [Certain soldiers, under the supervision of Linus, search Dagonet. Varro goes about among the soldiers, giving directions. They begin to busy themselves with the routine of camp life; some pitching tents, some building a fire, etc. Exeunt some.] Linus. There is nothing suspicious about him, captain. Varro. His answers are. They are overmuch craft or overmuch folly. Linus. Tut, a poor innocent! His wits are not right. There is no harm in him. Varro. Perhaps not. Sirrah, you are a juggler, say you? In anything but words? Dagonet. Why, that were the greatest jugglery of all; for the other but dazzles the eye, but this bewilders the mind itself. But in sooth I can twirl a plate upon occasion. Varro. If he be a juggler, he cannot be entirely fool. ... A little of your mystery. Dagonet. Stand back, all. Make a ring. Soldiers. A juggler! A juggler! Dagonet. Give me your purse. (Varro hands his purse to Dagonet, who puts it in his pocket.) Thank you. (Suppressed laughter among the soldiers.) Varro. Call you that juggling? Dagonet. Oh, sir, we that are gentlemen of the road must live as we may. Your bird of passage eats in all orchards. (Takes balls from his wallet and juggles with them. The soldiers applaud.) Pooh! Nothing ... nothing! All in the air ... Your knives, now ... Oh, they are not purses. (Juggles with knives. Applause, interrupted by a stir at the back.) Voices. The Emperor! The Emperor! Enter Lucius and Publius. Varro. Cæsar! [Dagonet sees Publius with a start of recognition, and tries to get out of sight. Publius catches his eye and looks at him markedly. While this is taking place—] Lucius. Your legion lies as I would have it. But have a care,—this post imports me much; Let not your merriment, which I do not censure, Forget your soldiership. The reinforcements Will be sent on at dusk. Dagonet. Lord Publius! Whew! I must have my wits about me now. Publius. Know you who yonder motley fellow is? Varro. A juggler and a common vagabond By his account. Publius. How came he in the camp? Varro. He is a prisoner ... an alien, Perhaps a Briton—it seemed wisest. ... Publius. Cæsar, When I was your ambassador in Britain, That fellow there, the Queen's Fool, Dagonet, Spoiled more than one well-thought device of mine. I do assure you, there is danger in him. He is alert, agile of wit and limb, Ready in unforeseen emergency, Well fitted for a spy. ... Has he been searched? Varro. But now. Linus. Thoroughly, my lord. Lucius. Is this the man Who so enragd you as we came this way? Linus. 'T was he, my lord. Lucius (throwing aside his cloak). Bid him come hither. Publius. Cæsar, 'T is like the searching was perfunctory: There may be nothing; still—he's crafty— Lucius. Fool, Here is Lord Publius, a Senator, And sometime our ambassador in Britain, Who says you are the Queen's Fool, and no juggler. Dagonet. Nay, that follows not; for he must have more dexterity than a juggler, who can play the fool for a woman and keep his place. But to tell the truth, I am but a gentleman juggler, a dilettante; I do it for the love of art and not professionally. That is to say, in a sort, I am but a juggler as one were to say of Cæsar, he is a lute player. Lucius. Thou saucy Fool, the craftiest musicians In Rome have praised my skill. Dagonet. I warrant they have; they had little craft else. Well, I also am extolled; as you are excellent among lute players, so am I in this whim of mine. An it were not for our stations, they of the crafts should find us troublesome rivals. Lucius. Lord Publius says you should be searched again. Dagonet. I hide nothing but my heart. Let it be by women this time. And your soldiers are something rougher than necessary. I am limber enough in the joints, but a flail would protest to be twisted so. Lucius. Your Fool is an odd rogue; I like him, Publius. Come let us see some of this boasted sleight. Dagonet. If I slip, you shall blame your thirsty-throated lubbers here, that took me for a pump and were nigh to put my shoulder out of joint. Ave, Cæsar, saltaturi salutamus. [Turns a handspring; then, with articles borrowed from the soldiery, performs several feats of legerdemain. Suddenly he begins to turn wheels on his hands, charging directly on the soldiers, who make way for him laughing, scattering from before the fire, by which Dagonet is stopped. Alighting on his feet, he throws his cap in the air, catches it on the end of his bauble, and twirls it, throwing it up again and again until at last he misses it and it falls into the fire. He springs forward as if to snatch it out, starts back as if he had burned his fingers, makes a wry face, and then with a whoop turns a somersault backwards in the air. But Publius, who has been watching him closely, runs to the fire, and plucking the cap from the flames, tears open the lining and holds up the letter that was hidden there. Dagonet crest-fallen.] Publius. Said I not so? (Opens the letter.) There's that within this letter That is for Cæsar's ear alone. Lucius. Withdraw. [Exeunt Varro, Linus and Soldiers.] Publius. Now this could not be better had we been In Fortune's secrets. You remember, Cæsar, When I came back to Rome from Arthur's court, I told you of the Queen and Launcelot, The love between them, and the dull King's blindness. Here is the proof ... a letter of the Queen— To Launcelot—this Fool the messenger. ... Listen. (Reads.) I have born you a son. ... Were I to tell you what wondrous intimations I have had concerning him, it would profit nothing; for the best is not to be fixed in words, nor even in thought. ... He is named Galahad, and it is given out that he is the child of Ylen, the daughter of King Pelles. ... I can no longer endure it to be apart from you. Therefore I have made an excuse of the King's victories and the lessening war, to set out to join the armies. It is known here that I start within the week; and I shall have crossed the sea into France before Dagonet gives this into your hands. Till then, when I can say what I know not how I should write,— Guenevere. [About this time, Dagonet, who has been sitting apart, in great dejection, lifts up his head as if an idea had come to him, looks about the scene, and then begins to watch the others attentively.] Lucius. Coming to join their armies! These barbarians— They take their women everywhere! ... Could we But capture her! If but the half be true These bragging Britons paragon her with, She is one of those rare things that must be looked on; If looked on, coveted; if coveted— I am still Cæsar. I have heard her so Recounted that to her Faustina were Indifferent fair; Hero but so so; and Great Cleopatra left without a lure. Helen herself and all Praxiteles Could dream of Aphrodite were but hints And guesses of her. If there be one such And that one not be mine, why then indeed The empire is o'erthrown and to be Cæsar No longer master. Publius. Rome is not yet fallen; But that it may not is our first concern. See you not how this letter may be used To split the enemy into factions? Lucius. Well; You will be practical. Publius. If Arthur see This letter— Lucius. There were some revenge in that. Ho, ho! ho, ho! what quintessential torment To see the picture of their stolen hours Start up before his fancy! Publius. Here's the fact; A bat could not be blind to 't. It must make Irreparable feud between the King And Launcelot; and half of Arthur's knights, The fairer half, will hold with Launcelot. The fate of Rome may hang upon this scroll. [A silence for some moments, during which Lucius paces up and down in thought. Dagonet watches him studiously from the back, and essays quietly to counterfeit his motions. When Lucius pauses and, facing Publius, is about to speak, Dagonet softly catches up the imperial cloak from where it has fallen, wraps it about him, and exit boldly, imitating the gait and bearing of the Emperor.] Lucius. No, Arthur will not cut off his right hand While it still wields the sword for him; he will not Break up his army in opposing camps And fall to internecine bickerings, Whate'er the cause, here, in an alien country, And with the prize o' the world in controversy. It is not generalship; and I have had reason To know how good a general he is. Publius. He is too foolish honest for such policy. Lucius. He does not plan his campaigns like a fool. I think he could make shift to endure this knowledge Until the issue of the war is tried. Then—doubtless ... but what good were that to us? No ... listen ... this is rather what to do; Let Launcelot, not Arthur, know the letter Is in our hands. Then offer him the choice,— To leave their armies and transfer his power To ours, in which event (which would ensure Arthur's complete and instant overthrow) He shall be crowned and sceptred over Britain In Arthur's place. If he refuse, the King Shall have the letter. On the one hand shame, The Queen a by-word—worse, their trysts, their kissings Ended forever,—and his supreme knighthood Cast out, without a country or a cause, An alien and alone among the nations: On the other hand, set high above all cavils, With Guenevere for Queen—the man were fool To hesitate. ... Publius. The name of traitor has A terror in it ... to these warriors, Whose only thoughts are actions. Lucius. That's a terror That fronts him either way. We must stretch all To intercept the journey of the Queen. With Guenevere our prisoner we triple Our power on Launcelot—without forgetting I wish to see this beauty for myself ... It may work ... it should work ... And this same Fool Will be our—Where is he? Publius. What! Gone! What ho! Enter Varro and soldiers. Where is the Fool? Varro. We left him here. Publius. He's gone. Varro. The Emperor here? One of the sentries said He had passed by. Lucius. My cloak. Publius. Your cloak, Most Mighty? Stolen? He has escaped. After him! Quick, Send out— Voices (without). To arms! to arms! to arms! [The sky begins to redden with the sunset.] Enter Linus, hurriedly. Linus. Captain! The enemy are almost at our lines; The scouts report them in great numbers on The Cassian Way. I have called the men to arms. Varro. Upon us? Cæsar,— Lucius. Where are they that saw them? Bring me to them. [Exeunt all but Publius. Voices (without). Fall in! fall in! fall in! [Noises of preparation without; then silence.] Enter a Messenger. Messenger. Where is the Emperor? Publius. Whence come you? Messenger. From Rome. Couriers from Cinna's Hill bring word the foe Are moving toward Janiculum. The cohorts Would know if they are still to advance this way. [Cries without, “Pendragon! Pendragon!” Alarums. Noise of fighting.] Enter Varro. Varro. Where 's Cæsar? They outnumber us ten to one. We cannot hold them long. The Emperor Must be in safety ere it is too late. Flee he and you at once! I'll make a stand If possible. If reinforcements come, All 's not lost yet. [Exit. Noises of combat.] Enter Lucius. Publius. The place cannot be held. Away, my lord! Lucius. Peace! ... Ho! a courier! Messenger. Most Mighty! Publius. One that comes in haste from Rome. Lucius. Then get you back to Rome and bid the cohorts Without the Flaminian Gate hither at once ... Go! [Exit Messenger.] Publius. Flee, save yourself, Cæsar— Lucius. Peace, I say! [Cries without, “A Launcelot! a Launcelot!”] Enter the Romans, fleeing, in great disorder. Why do you run, you curs? Stand! Turn! Back, slaves! You scum of Rome! you pigs! you— Soldiers (dispersedly) Save yourselves! ... Flee! ... Out o' the way there! ... Devil take you! ... Flee! [Lucius and Publius are swept away by the rush of the fugitives.] Enter Britons, led by Ector. Then Launcelot, Bors, and Dinadan. Ector. Pendragon! On! Pendragon! Launcelot. On! Pursue them As far's the bridge. [Exeunt Ector and Britons.] Bors. They have but taken the pains To pitch our tents and build our fire for us. Dinadan. And breathe us just sufficiently to taste The supper we shall cook on 't with a relish. Launcelot. Bors, see you to the quartering of the troops As they come up. Dinadan, follow Ector, And, if he need more men, supply them to him. [Exeunt Bors and Dinadan.] Enter Dagonet. It begins to be twilight. Dagonet. My lord! Launcelot. Dagonet! ... What has happened? ... Dagonet. Kick me for a clod, a dolt, a duffer, a doodle! a lubberly, inept, clumsy, bungling dizzard and hobbledehoy! I am not capable of ... Launcelot. Plague on your prating! Set my mind at rest. What tidings of the Queen? Dagonet. There's nought ill there. The Queen is well, and the child she has borne— Launcelot. The child! Dagonet. Ay, sir, a boy—a real boy, with movable eyes. The Princess Ylen has understudied for the mother and will assume the part hereafter. Launcelot. My son! Dagonet. The women feign to find a marvellous resemblance to you in him; but for my part—a man's eyes have no skill in these mysteries—but I would have said your lordship had a more plentiful provision of nose and was—... Launcelot. Peace, Dagonet. Dagonet. Nay, you have not heard all yet. The Queen is coming. Launcelot. Coming? Hither? Dagonet. With all the speed she is able. I was to go before her and make her paths straight; but I got lost in the wilderness. Launcelot. Coming? But all you say is like a song; You made me think you came with evil news. Dagonet. One word more, and my singing is all unmusicked—off the pitch, out o' the key; and you would liefer hear a charivari of tin pans and penny trumpets. What I have told you, you should have read, in the Queen's own hand, in a letter I was to deliver you. This morning, when I overtook the armies, Sir Bors sent me forward to this hill, saying I should find you here; where instead I found the enemy, was captured, searched, and the letter taken from me. Launcelot. A letter? Know you what was writ in it? Dagonet. Not the phrase; but I know that it spoke of her coming and of the child. Launcelot. The child ... Oh, my God! Dagonet. If you would run your sword through me, I should not much care; and if you would kick me, it would be a real kindness. Launcelot. We must get back the letter. Enter Ector, Bors, and Dinadan. Afterwards, certain Soldiers with a haunch on a spit. Here's Dagonet Come to help us take Rome—No, do not laugh; This is quite serious ... and what he undertakes, More perilous than ought we soldiers do. ... (To Soldiers.) Go, use some other fire. We'd be alone here. [Exeunt Soldiers.] Dinadan. Well, Dagonet, what are you going to do? Set Rome on fire ... or the Tiber, which? Launcelot. Mask himself as a slave and enter Rome. The King is lucky to have such a spy. Dinadan, take him with you to your tent, And see how well you can disfeature him. Dinadan. Disfeature him? I'll so disfeature him His bath-tub would n't know him. Dagonet. Come along, then. You may shave me as bald as a Greek monk. You may dye me black, yellow, or striped. You may make anything of me, from Epictetus to a blackamoor. Only I bar mutes and eunuchs. Dinadan. A few slashes, with peppers in them ... Dagonet. Hold! ... Well, for the sake of the cause. A beggar will ulcerate himself for a penny, and my reward is glory. Dinadan. Then you will go to glory pickled. Dagonet. Why, then my glory will keep. Dinadan. Come on, Fool. Dagonet. After you, sir. [Exeunt Dinadan and Dagonet.] Launcelot. Follow them, Ector, lest their frolic wits Outrun the purpose with mere travesty. ... [Exit Ector.] Where is the King? Bors. Seeing the enemy In no great force, and a mere skirmish forward Wherein we must be victors, he turned back To rejoin Lionel, and himself o'erlook The dispositions made of the main forces. Soldiers (without, singing). Then out, boys, and forage, For a man can't fight on porridge And swagger with a soldierly effrontery. There 's no butcher to be paid, And no game laws to evade In the heart of the enemy's country. Hi! hi! hi! Bors. I am not so wakeful as those fellows yonder; I'll have a bite of supper and to bed. Launcelot. Good night, then, Bors. Bors. Good night. [Exit Bors. Launcelot. Have all these men No cankers in their hearts? Is it the great Alone that suffer, that these simple folk Are so light-hearted? A Soldier (without, singing). There 's a lass of Camelot Winsome as the wind, Wilful as the wind! Would I were in Camelot! Fond as the doe, Frolic as the snow— Lucky is the lover's lot Wins the lass of Camelot. There's a lass of Camelot Sweet as the hills, As the windy hills! Would I were in Camelot! ... Launcelot. Yet to have a son! That's worth an agony. ... Born of such a mother!— How his achievements will keep life a joy! The day he puts his armor on, unblazoned, And goes to his first victory, what pride To see his helmet glittering in the sun! Such pride in one's own deeds would spoil the deed; A son's accomplishment is ours for triumph, Not ours for selfward shame. To have a son! Now could I almost join the soldiers there And sing for mere o'erflowing. Soldiers (without, singing). On with the King! On with the King! Sword, flash, and battle-axe, swing! Shout, “For the King!” Cheer, “For the King!” Strike—for the King! Launcelot. We are in the palm Of Fate. The unremitting drift of things Bears us we know not whither—to be engulfed, Or by a random whim of chance swept on To some haphazard safety ... all to nothing! There seems not so much hope as would suffice To make a weary swimmer struggle on, No sail nor shore in sight. ... Yet I am calm, ... Calm as the night ... as pure of doubt or dread As if the sky had told me All is well. It is strange. ... And she is coming! Fill her sails With nimble wafture, wind—but gently, too, As now you touch my forehead. Glide away Beneath her wheels like running water, roads, And speed her hither in a dream. ... Coming! ... What a still joy is in the air to-night! As if earth hushed her noises that our souls Might hear each other across the silent leagues. ... Have your will, Fate: not on us is its might. [Pauses, and stands silently, in the light of the fire, with his cloak wrapped about him, looking out over the valley.] Soldiers (without, singing). There 's Meg and there's Molly And there's Susan and there's Polly; And we'll all be jolly When we're home from the wars Curtain. ACT III. Scene. Rome. Evening. Gardens of the Palace of Lucius. At back, a colonnade of the palace, with balcony above. On one side, a place arranged for the performance of an interlude. The palace is brilliantly lighted, and sounds of feasting and revel are heard. Voconius and Voconia. A Voice (without, singing). Tell me no grim tales of a surly morrow; Wreathe me with roses. Voconius. That is Terentius singing; his cæsuras Would make Catullus creep. There, look, from here You can see Cæsar. Voconia. With the purple toga, And bay-leaves in his hair? Voconius. Ay. ... Let me clasp This buckle for you; there, that 's better; now The flesh just hints it hides there, as you walk ... You are perfect in the lines? Voconia. Yes. ... He is like The statues of Antinous. Voconius. That's Metella That sits by him;—she bores him now. And that's Her uncle, Publius Metellus, who Whispers apart with Cæsar; he and Bursa Are Cæsar's favorites. Voconia. And you, Voconius? Voconius. But after them. I hope, my little sister, To change all that, now you are come to court. [Attendants pass across the scene, bearing fruits and wines. Laughter within the palace.] Voconia. Oh, how I long for all that life—the laughter, The motion, the delight! Voconius. It is all yours To-night, Voconia; only do not play The frightened fool to Cæsar. Voconia. If I falter It will be with the shudder of new joy. Voconius. A coyness, if you will; but not too far. Voconia. No fear, brother. I have dreamed of this time,— And Lydia, my nurse, has read me tales Out of your library, and poems, till I would drink the very wine whose airy vision I tire to lift in fancy to my lips. Voconius. Good; I so ordered it. Your education Has been a care to me. ... The Emperor Is in a happy mood. Yesterday Bursa Defeated Galahault at Janiculum, And captured him, with many of his men. The captive general is here, to make The banquet more triumphant. Now come we, And on the crest and sprayward of his humor Light like a sunbeam shattered into mist. I have just come from Cæsar; he is pleased Graciously to commend the title of My interlude, “The Rape of Helen,”—he Is in the vein for 't. Oh, he knows the difference Between me and Terentius! ... Let the peplos Loosen a little and slip down—so—as if You were unaware. ... When Helen says, “And thou, If I be she of whom the goddess speaks, Take me,”—look not at Paris, look at Cæsar. I'll yield the role to him there ... and the rest You may improvise between you.—Withdraw yonder. I'll back to Cæsar and conduct him hither. [Exit.] Voconia. O dreams and long desires, farewell, farewell! How beautiful is Cæsar! [Exit.] Enter a Monk. Various persons pass across the scene, among them, Dagonet, disguised. The Monk detains him. Dagonet. Have you brought the manuscripts? Monk. They are a mirror-snare of Satan. They have filled my ears with a buzzing of fiends. They stir up evil thoughts in the heart and make the abomination of Baal and Ashtoreth to swim between mine eyes and the crucifix. But that our holy father, the Pope, had commanded me to copy them for you, I had torn them in pieces a dozen times and burned the fragments with fire. Dagonet. Why, I heard Voconius declaim the verses, and I was not prompted to so much as a wriggle. But I am not a monk. And I am hardened to bad poets. Monk. May the thoughts they bred in me be forgiven! I did contend stoutly with them. Dagonet. Tut, man, the Pope will absolve you. You sinned for the glory of God. Give me the manuscripts, and copy this. Monk. Shall I put my soul in peril again? Dagonet. Tell me this,—do you not wish for the success of King Arthur? Monk. Sir, the Pope and all good Christians pray for him daily. He is a righteous man; and he is descended from the holy Empress, Saint Helena, that found the Cross, and from the great Constantine, who saw the glory of it in the heavens. He hath the better title to the empire, and the present government is a revel of Antichrist. Dagonet. I serve King Arthur. My business here, my true business, is the discovery of certain papers. To make my search the easier, the Pope commended me to Voconius for a scribe; and as everybody knows His Holiness has the best calligraphers in Rome, Voconius was delighted to buy me, and the coffers of the Church were enriched. ... Now I learned letters enough of the Glastonbury monks to read what is writ plain, if I be not hurried; but a scribe—! They would take my pothooks for ancient Chaldean. The Pope's reputation would be gone forever; and I should be flogged for a dunce or a cheat, or worse, the plot discovered and—(making a gesture as of a noose about his neck) the Lord have mercy on my soul! Monk. Give me the new manuscript. I will speak to the prior. Dagonet. Do so; and to the Pope himself, too. ... Now, be off; they are coming. Monk. Dominus vobiscum. [Exit.] Dagonet (looking at the copies brought by the Monk). Marvellously chirographied! Dagonet, Dagonet, who would have thought thou hadst this art in thee! Who knows what he can do till he tries? Enter Slaves, with torches; then Lucius, Voconius, Metella, Publius, Galahault, Senators, Knights, Courtiers, Ladies, Attendants, etc. Publius (To Galahault). Though Bursa get the glory of your capture, I cannot be persuaded but that you Were your own conqueror. When a veteran Dares a defeat like a foolhardy boy, He means to be defeated,—he's a reason ... Lucius (to Voconius). Well, more of this again. I do not question, Mind you, but art may wring a compelled beauty Out of the very meanness of its means. Voconius. I grant my judgment weaker, but meseems Rhyme is no meanness but a charm the more The ancients knew not of. Lucius. The charm 's too simple, Too obvious; but our decadent art Must have its cymbals. Come, your interlude ... You present Paris ...? Voconius. And my sister, Helen; I crave your gentle judgment for us both. [Exit. Lucius. I did not know Voconius had a sister. Metella. A school-girl,—come to court for the first time To-night,—a nun-bred miss. A proper Helen! Helen the vestal! Helen the ingénue! Lucius. Sir Galahault, pray you, be not withdrawn So far from us; a word with you. [They talk apart.] Metella (to Publius). Where 's Bursa? Publius. He left the palace not an hour ago. Some news that came by sudden courier Put him clean from the matter here in hand. Metella. What can it be, I wonder? Publius. I suspect, Some news of Guenevere's itinerary. I cannot think what else should stir him so; He knows her capture is a thing that Cæsar Makes much of. Metella. Is it so? Lucius. —a merry ... Publius! [Lucius and Publius converse.] Metella. Sir Galahault, in your far Britain what Are the chief sights you boast of? Galahault. Truly, madam, I think the fairest sight that Britain boasts Is camped before your walls. Metella. Nay, but I meant ... [They go on conversing.] Lucius. It is not that. We have known for several days The route she follows. If she change it not, Our ambuscade is sure. Perhaps she—Well, We'll know anon. Here comes our interlude. Enter Voconius as Paris. Paris. Sea-born and subtle and fair and mighty as the sea, Changing and changeless Aphrodite, unto thee I lift my voice in praise and my palms in thanksgiving; Who hast brought me, witless of the port I sailed for, giving The helm to Chance and thee, hither to the Argive shore In my black ships, and folding me about with more Than earthly mist hast led my steps, divinely dazed, Hither; and all the blind night from my soul is rased. For surely now I am aware that I shall see Her whom thy divine kiss-wise lips have promised me, The fairest among women. ... Are they nymphs that yonder Rise from the roseate waters like the dreams that wander About the tranced woods of young vision? Lo, they stand Naked and naiad-haired upon the river strand And the air flushes with their bodies and the morning. I tremble, and my heart swells with a divine warning; No water-spirits these,—human and kindred-sweet, For now they gather up strewn garments at their feet, Such as the Spartan women wear; and now they cover The beauty that has had the winds and waves for lover. One only, lordlier, lovelier than the others, still Stands rapturous of the air. They wait upon her will As on a queen's. Their beauty in her beauty merges As the dim stars at dawn founder in luminous surges. I cannot see her face, but all love's splendor slips Down shoulders like the moon and the music of her hips. Now at a sign they bring her saffron peplos to her; And now ... she turns—Cypris! if it be not to woo her, Her, daughter of desire and mystery and joy, Why hast thou led me hither from the towers of Troy Across the winy sea? Surely none other fairer Than she in all the round world might the furthest farer Of all earth's wanderers find; but I, beholding her, Praise thee, O Queen of Love, and am thy worshipper. ... Lucius. Well done, Voconius! All. Bravo! Well done, Voconius! Lucius. What crafty Alexandrines! Poet first,— But only less the actor. All. Bravo, bravo! Enter Chorus of Spartan Damsels, and Voconia, as Helen. Chorus. Sparta, thy daughters, [str. Fearless and free,— Behold us, how we laugh at the cold hill-waters, Blush not for bodies brown with the sun, Tough with the wind and rain! The young men fear us in the footrace; we Are not useless in casting the javelin. Swift and sane, (Out of air, life and strife beauty born!) The gods have made us goodly to look upon And no man does us scorn. What was there wanting, [ant. Sparta, to thee? The touch of sky that beggars the brown earth's vaunting, Beauty that pierces men like a spear, Beauty divinely bright, Not of the earth, that makes men mad to see; Until Helen was given thee for queen and the wonder-light Drenched the dales, flushed the peaks as with wine,— Beauty that makes the whole world tremble and veer And reel into the divine. Daughter of Leda, Queen! [ep. What god has given thee The splendor and the sheen Of the dawns that live in thee? Our praise is alien, unimpassioned, far, To do thee honor, star Of the flushed cast! Sparta is not aflame Enough to be thy priest. Beauty is with child with Love, And until Love be born There is no name By which her rite is said. Come, then, and above Our altars from Lighten with morn, Love! He comes, O Helen; not forever Shalt thou be mocked with undivine endeavor. Lift up thy head, Daughter of Leda! [Applause.] Lucius. A fairer Helen never played the part. Is she not exquisite, Sir Galahault? Galahault. As lyric as a throstle's song, my lord. Metella. Too slight for Helen—pretty, but girlish. Lucius. Peace! Now Paris speaks. Paris. Whoe'er thou be, in Sparta's rough and rocky ways That standest like a dream of flowers and fervent days, Rose-wrought and clad with a diviner air, live ever! Helen. Hail, Prince, for so thou seemest! Welcome! Paris. I have never, Save in the immortal goddesses, seen with my eyes Beauty passing the beauty of women, till now you rise Like a new throne in heaven. Helen. What word is this you utter Of the immortal goddesses? Paris. Yea, for the utter And incommunicable beauty of those three most high, Here and Athene and Aphrodite, I, even I, Paris, the son of Priam, prince of tower-built Ilion, Saw naked; for they chose me, me out of the million On million of the eyes of mortals, to behold No borrowed feature but their very beauty, and hold The scales of judgment, weighing to which divinest splendor Of such the supreme three, it were but due to render The golden apple by unbidden Ate flung, Marked “To the fairest.” Helen. Tell us, prithee, then, among Such beauty which supreme for beauty thou declarest, O thou that judgest gods! Paris. Because I named her fairest, Devious-minded Aphrodite has sworn an oath That the most fair of women shall give me her troth And couch with me in Troy. But thou—who is above thee, Who of the daughters of men? Helen. And thou wouldst that I love thee? Fie! this is a low thought thou pluckest from its sheath. Chorus. A shameless word has crossed the doorsill of his teeth. Paris. Shame dwells not with the gods nor in speech which the gods warrant. Helen. Say no more, lest the King's wrath whelm thee in its torrent. Seek her among the maidens; I am wife and Queen. Chorus. Such impudence of evil we have never seen. Paris. No king's wrath terrifies me, but lest anger lighten From that clear brow of thine. Those lifted lids can frighten More than the lidless eyes of Death. Helen. They make not die. Paris. Yea, if they slay my soul, what though the limbs live? I Am dead, no less. Be merciful as thou art mighty! Helen. What god burns in my veins? Is it thou, Aphrodite? ... Counsel me, girls; the man is fair to look upon, Persuasive, and a goddess urges his cause on. Chorus. Surely the man is goodly, and the gods not to be thwarted. Helen. A goddess also hinders me, the Queen of wide-courted Heaven, lady of marriage-beds, and sets my soul at odds. Chorus. We counsel that thou give due honor to both gods. Helen. When each gives each the lie! Your counsel profits little. Paris. The will of the goddess is not weak nor her words brittle. Knewest thou ever an oracle that went unfulfilled? If thou deny me, then needs must be what she willed Other, and thou art not the fairest among women. Who shall say that, with eyes that sight grows not yet dim in? And since thou art the fairest, as all men may see, Be pious to the gods and pitiful to me. Helen. No; lest men say I make myself to be the foremost, Too eager for the doom ordained. And men adore most Those who exalt themselves not. If the fairest indeed, Let her declare me so by no ambiguous deed. No word nor will of mine her oracle fulfilling, Let her put forth her power and master me unwilling. And thou, if I be she of whom the goddess speaks, Take me despite myself, and despite all the Greeks. [Voconius, stepping out of his part, turns to Lucius and recites by way of Epilogue the lines that follow.] Voconius. I have dared higher than the Muses will, A song too splendid for my simple skill. I am not Paris, to see beauty bare; Not Ovid I, such visions to declare. Forgive, Apollo; let some greater bard Achieve the raptures proved for me too hard. Is there not here a poet with a lyre To end my broken song with thine own fire; A greater prince than all the line of Troy, And dear to Venus as the Dardan boy? If such there be, a new-born god of day, Let him, compassionate of my feebler lay, Assume the rôle too heavy for my hands And take the gods' best gift: there Helen stands! Chorus. For the gods that brought Helen to birth Gave to Cæsar the rule of the earth. [The doors of the palace open and Guenevere appears between the pillars, attended by Bursa.] Lucius. There Helen stands! [A pause. Sensation.] Bursa. I come late to the feast; But bring a forfeit makes my fault seem golden,— Guenevere, Queen of Britain. Guenevere. Which is Cæsar? ... Since Cæsar wars on women and his arms Have made me prisoner, I sue to Cæsar For leave to guard one royal privilege, My privacy. Lucius. Guards, slaves, attend the Queen! Be her desires commands! [Exit Guenevere, attended.] Break up the feast! And each one to his house! [Exeunt all except Galahault, Metella, Voconia, and Publius.] Metella. Sir Galahault! At midnight, by the ilex! It may be That I can find a way to set the Queen At liberty—perhaps yourself as well— I know not. I must set my wits at work. [Exit.] Publius (approaching.) Fear nothing for the Queen, Sir Galahault. I know not what Metella said to you, But I have a shrewd guess. Well, do not heed her. I have her interests at heart, and yours, As well as mine,—for hers and yours are mine In this. Believe me, 't is the prudent part To be of my advice. If 't please you come To my apartment in an hour from now, I'll give you weighty reasons. Galahault. Very well. [Exit Publius. Lady (approaching Voconia, who is weeping), our northern masques are rough to yours, And I perhaps no critic; but methought Your Helen had a grace, a charm, like April When she comes up with lilies from the south. If not the Helen that the minstrels sing, Standing upon the battlements of Troy, Great with having much lived, no less a Helen, Such as she might have been ere she had loved, Sweet with the bud's life, wistful, incomplete, And beautiful with unacquainted eyes. I am much beholden to you. [Going.] Enter Voconius. Sir, your comedy Was worth a better epilogue. [Exit.] Voconius. Indeed It had an epilogue not on the bills. Perdition! To be beaten by a fluke! All my art jangled by a brutal fact! Well, why do you stay here? You make me wait. I must come back for you! ... And this barbarian, Who proffers sentence like an amateur ... My comedy—a better epilogue ... What was he saying to you? Voconia. The one word Of kindliness in my humiliation. Oh, I believe it is another life They have where he has lived! He has an air As if he saw a world we overlook. Voconius. I half believe you are in love with him. Voconia. And if I said I were! Voconius. Bah! a barbarian. Voconia. When all the others left without a look So much as if they were aware we lived, He only took the pains to speak to me. There was a better breed of courtesy In this than all our fine punctilios. Voconius. Your country's enemy! Voconia. Do not be absurd. You have instructed me in many things, But I do not remember that to love My country was among them. What is Rome To you, or any Roman of us all? A place where it is good to eat and drink. Your country is your interest with Cæsar. Voconius. And who but you were but a moment since All for this Cæsar, eager for his favor, And hot for all this life you hold so cheap? Voconia. I have had a bandage taken from my eyes; And the poor pennies that I groped for seem As nothing to the treasure of beautiful things I see about me. Yes, I love ... I love! Go you to Cæsar, if you will; but I, Although my hero take no thought for me, Will follow him and serve him till I die. Voconius. This is a mere child's folly. Come with me. Voconia. Let me stay here alone a moment first. It is a fancy; but I have a need Somehow to be here quiet and not think. I will not keep you long ... I beg of you ... Voconius. You are a fool. [Exit. Voconia. I saw him coming back. [Withdraws into the shadows.] Enter Galahault and Dagonet. Galahault. ... So many things at once I knew not of. I had no notion you were not in Britain; You startled me. Dagonet. I would I could get word to the Queen that I am here. Even a dog counts, if it is your own dog. Galahault. Remain you here awhile. I know not yet What is to happen. There are plots afoot. Publius and Metella severally Seek to have private speech with me to-night. Wait here, until I know what comes of it. Dagonet. By the mass, I cannot. I am a slave. I belong to Voconius. And it is even now time that I should be within doors. He has paid good money for me, believing me to excel in the copying of manuscripts. My function is chiefly to transcribe his verses. Galahault. A scrivener, Dagonet? How do you manage that? Dagonet. Farm it out, as his steward does his rents. The Pope being with us secretly, I stand well with the monks here. It is ticklish walking; a tight-rope is nothing to it. But I hope not to tumble until—What was that? Galahault. Where? Dagonet. Something flitting in the shadows there. ... [Starts toward the palace as if to head off Voconia, who comes forward.] Voconia. Sir, I have overheard your conversation; I did not mean to ... Pray you, pardon me. ... Oh, I will not betray you. ... 'T is not that. I'd serve you. ... Let him stay with you to-night. I will excuse his absence to my brother— Say I employed him in my own affairs. ... Hold! (To Dagonet.) You, sirrah, I bid you serve this lord To-night; he is your master until morning. You have my orders to remain here. [Going.] Galahault. Stay! Voconia. Oh, sir, my brother waits for me. Galahault. No less Let me conduct you to him. You must hear My thanks, lady, whether you will or no. [Exeunt Galahault and Voconia. When they are well off, Dagonet whistles.] Enter Guenevere, on the balcony, followed by Lucius. Dagonet withdraws under the trees. Guenevere. The air is sultry. I stifle in the room. Lucius (unclasping a girdle). Pearls to a princess are a futile gift; But note the workmanship—what craft of line! Intractable jade carved intricately and free As woven frondage, and the pearls in it I know not by what miracle of art Made part of it and better than themselves Like berries in the mistletoe. Receive it As earnest of the rate I hold you at. Guenevere. Why, would you set a price upon my head? I cannot else be rated. Lucius. Nay, but as A conquered prince may render nominal tribute, Itself a trifle, token none the less He doth confess the victor suzerain. Guenevere. Strange victor, who must ask her vassal's leave To go or come! Lucius. May not a vassal pluck His master by the sleeve and hold him so A moment, while he has a suit to him? Guenevere. You hold yourself no vassal to me, Cæsar. Lucius. Oh, but I do. You will not take the sense In which you are more powerful than Cæsar And take your captors captive. Guenevere. Do I so? Now this is marvellous. Lucius. I do not think My meaning is so dark to you, although You make it seem so. Guenevere. Pray you, be content To let it seem so, then ... You of the south Cry out upon our northern mists and fogs, But I have found that these make many things Fair that I do not find so in the sun. Lucius. Then let this speak me to you through a veil. Guenevere. It is most beautiful; and a lordly gift, Worthy of prince to prince. Lucius. But you refuse it. Guenevere. I am your captive. Lucius. You are Queen of Britain. Guenevere. And does Rome send a friendly gift to Britain? ... Where is my throne, my state, my ceremony, That I should give due honor to the gift? Lucius. Your throne is where you are, your presence state Beyond all pageantry. ... You will not? ... [He replaces the girdle and is silent.] Madam, you are too proud. You are a queen, But I am Cæsar. Guenevere. Our imperial cousin, Therefore. I know the boast the Cæsars make, That kings are but their dukes and deputies; But we of Britain do not brook your boast. Nor, Lucius Cæsar, were I but myself, No queen at all, would I accept the gifts Of any, even Cæsar, not being free. Lucius. Why, let the politics alone, then. Take it We are but man and woman, you and I, Lucius and Guenevere! I bring no gifts, I only see how beautiful you are— Nay, I have looked on beauty many times But never until now on something lambent And magical and not to be expressed, Which is perhaps what they that dwell in Mars Or Algol may call beauty. Mere perfection Is cold and lacks the wizardry of charm, The melody and moonlight of desire, That makes you glow with something far and sey. Guenevere. What time is it? Lucius. What time is it? I know not. Why, madam, what I speak of is not light, Nor to be turned off with a light reply. Guenevere. I have been told that I am beautiful By many men and mirrors. ... So be it; I am more interested in the time. Lucius. Are you a woman or a marble goddess? No marble, certes! Yet the gods themselves, Or so they fable, found delight in gifts And praise; but you recoil from these and harden. What can I do to show you that I love you? Just love, perhaps—ay, that is best. No price To buy love with, but love. If you but knew, If you would but believe how I desire you, I think such love would breed some love in you; At least some favor, some sweet courtesy. Guenevere. I will believe you love me when you are silent; For what is my desire would be yours too, If you indeed loved. Lucius. Is that love that is So mild it can be mastered? Is it love That cares so little it can yield its hope Without a struggle? I do not love you so. To lack you is a gap I cannot fill With moral maxims. Guenevere. Nor with noble deeds! Lucius. Oh, think what we might live! The world should be The lackey of our pleasure. Samarcand Shall clothe our limbs in silks and India Make sweet the rooms with sandal; wines from Crete, Iberia, and the Rhone; the Arabian berry, Rumored of far infrequent travellers, Brought first to the West for us—Oh, we shall sit Like the old gods, Olympic ... while the smoke Of the world's hecatombs comes up to us, The lords of the earth, the gods of it ... [Touching her arm.] Guenevere. Slave! Lucius. Slave? .. slave—? Guenevere. Oh! ... Throw thy crown for serfs to scramble for! Go find some squire that loves and sue to be His knave till thou learn what it is to be A lover and a knight! Lucius. God! ... Oh, I'll wring A bitter-sweet revenge of you! Guenevere. Thou wilt? What wilt thou do? Lucius. This first. [Seizes her forcibly and kisses her.] Guenevere. Ah!—Oh! ... oh! ... Death! thou hast dared—thou ... Gah! Wert thou a snake, More horror would not shudder down my soul. Take thyself hence, that like a leprosy Infectest the foul night; go—Think not, Lucius, My soul is such a thing as fears may stifle— Blottest thou my sight still? Go, go, go, go, go! ... Lucius. Madam, you are superb. I am no tyrant,— At least no vandal. I can no more mar So fine a passion with an after-scene Than chip a Venus of Praxiteles. So, fare you well—until we meet again ... I am more yours than ever. [Exit.] Dagonet (gliding out of the shadows). S-s-s-t! Curtain. ACT IV. Scene. Night. A wild part of the Campagna. Enter Publius, Bursa, Galahault, Guenevere and Soldiers. Publius and Bursa somewhat apart from the others. Bursa. Halt! An Officer. Halt! Bursa. This is the place. Publius. Is there some shelter Near by? Bursa. A sort of cavern. Publius. Let the Queen And Galahault be conveyed there. Bursa. They will be As well under the stars; 't is a rough place. Publius. Let them be made as easeful as may be; But we should be alone when Launcelot comes. Bursa. I hardly credit that he comes alone. Publius. At first he would not, but at last consented On Varro's safeguard. Bursa. Varro's! Publius. There 's some oath Of brother-in-arms between them. Bursa. How is that? Publius. Some friendship that began when Launcelot Held Varro prisoner. Bursa. He takes his word? Why,—what prevents us?—we might hold him captive, And—think of it—he ... Publius. No; Varro might, not we. The soldiers are all his. Besides, he has A special and unlimited commission From Cæsar, making his command to-night An independent service, that reports Direct to Cæsar and to him alone. Bursa. Not even to me? Publius. No; you are here, as I am An envoy, not a general. Bursa. Has Cæsar Put such a slight upon me? Not command My officer? Had I been told of this, I had seen all your politics in hell Ere I had come! Publius. It has all been conceived, Planned, executed in so short a time There was no chance to tell you. Only thus Would Varro pledge his word; and Launcelot Would have no other surety. Be not angry. Consider, 't is but for a night; and then, The exigence. Why stand upon a scruple, If it turns the scale; ... but rather than lose all, Be somewhat blind to what you cannot help. Bursa. I like it not. Publius. Nor I; but failure less. Guenevere. Why have you brought us to this lonely place? Publius. Madam, we serve the Emperor's desires ... But, in this case, believe me, yours as well. Guenevere. The Emperor's desires will be ill served If you serve mine indeed! (Continuing as if to herself.) They were served well If some strange sudden evil fell on him ... Publius. Madam, you mistake me—and the Emperor. That Cæsar loves you, I can no wise doubt, When I look on you; I should wonder rather That there were any one who loved you not, Being great enough to dare. But divine Cæsar, Who is as God over men's earthly fates, Ordains not for himself but for their weal Whom Heaven commits to his authority. See now how you misjudge him; we are here For your sake, madam ... to bring to you a friend ... Sir Launcelot. ... Guenevere. It will rejoice me much To see a knightly face of mine own court ... But what does godlike Cæsar's omniprescience Discern in this “for those whom Heaven commits To his authority”? Some general good, Doubtless, beyond the pleasure of a queen. Publius. It were a general good the war should cease; And were that general good so brought to pass That the same means that wrought it wrought as well Some courtesy particular to one To whom the general good itself might yield A little and the world yet be no loser,— Guenevere. Why, what a mouse of compliment is this The mountain labors with! Come, sir, your point. I have no will to end the war—what then? Publius. But if it end for Cæsar's good and yours? Guenevere. How can my good and Cæsar's be the same? Publius. By nothing that is not your heart's desire. You'll say so when you know ... Bursa. Hark! Publius. Are they coming? Bursa. It is their horses' hoofs upon the rocks. Publius. Madam, and you, most noble Galahault, Pray you, withdraw a little ... Officer! ... (To Guenevere.) This will all clear itself. (To Galahault.) That which I spoke of Is sudden ripe; he meets us here to-night. Galahault. Sir Launcelot? Publius. Ay; you were thus much wrong,— Perhaps in the rest, too. Galahault. Never believe it; he will not. Publius. Well, we shall see. You hold with us if he does— [Exeunt Guenevere, Galahault and Soldiers.] And if he does not, there's no faith in reason ... What, sullen still? Why, look you, man, we tremble Upon the dizzy edge of ruin. Fail To win this lover-warrior, Launcelot— I hope we shall not—but if we should fail, What 's left to us but death, or loss of all That makes life life,—place, pride, power, riches, all Blown to the winds like dust from Stromboli! Be not deceived that Galahault is taken. The empire's lost; Rome only still is ours, And no hope save division in the foe. At such a time fits not to stand on forms. Come, man, your help. Bursa. Why, such help as I can; But I've no stomach for it. Enter Varro and Launcelot. Varro. Yonder they stand. I'll wait apart here where the soldiers are. Launcelot. My friend! Varro. Well, well, no words. [They clasp hands and exit Varro.] Publius. You know each other? Launcelot. Well, in the field. Publius. We are both knowing to this; Speak, therefore, to us both. Launcelot. You say you have A certain letter. What's your price for it? Publius. Oh, sir, you gallop. Launcelot. I am not come here, Leaving my camp with this night-muffled haste, For smirk and roundabout of envoy phrase. You say you have a letter; I reply, Let me look on it. If it be what you Report it,—take the ransom of a king. ... Publius. You rate it highly ... but I highlier. I would not barter it for aught so gross As gold; in fine, the thing is priceless, sir. But what I would not sell my enemy, I'd give my friend. Launcelot. Give? Is it possible! Publius. Ay, to my friend. Launcelot. Friend? What mean you by that? Bursa. Pledge us your friendship, noble Launcelot, And we will send your letter back with gifts. Launcelot. You seem to speak me fair and honorable; But yet your pardon, sirs, if I mistrust The sudden friendship of an ancient foe. ... Friendship? You cannot mean that comrade love That knits men closer than the clasp of kin. That is not born of compact nor discretion, Nor ripened in a night. Publius. May 't grow to that! But there must be a friendship to begin with. Launcelot. You say well; and indeed I must be friends With those who friend me. I were ingrate else. Bursa. Here 's my hand on it. I loved you for a foe, And fought you as a man might clip his mistress; But side by side instead of face to face, We'll rout the very thunder. Launcelot. Side by side ... Side by side ... Publius (hastily). You shall be king in Britain, And Guenevere your queen. Launcelot. Treason! Publius. No treason; Treason is to the State, and that is Cæsar, To whom your king and you alike owe fealty. Launcelot. That is our quarrel; I'll not argue it. Treason or no treason to the State, it is Black treason to my friend and to my cause. Publius. Are you so slow to treason to your friend? Oh, sir, you cannot be both true and false At once. I know you loyalty itself, Saving to Arthur—who could blame you that?— But true to him you are not. Then be true At least to your own course and to yourself. Play not the hypocrite to your own soul To lull yourself with loyalty by halves. Being against him, oh be wholly so— No secret enemy, but an open one! And since a fate is on you to be false, Be bravely false and reap the fruits of it. Launcelot. I am no hypocrite; I love the King, Howe'er my life bely it. Publius. Love him? Why? What loves he, think you? Not the Queen. Not you. Not anything but his ambition. What! Would he not sacrifice you both to-day For what he calls the welfare of the State, Which is his own? Put he not under foot His early loves, to make a stairway of To mount the throne? ... Launcelot. You understand him not. 'T is no defect of heart in him, but rather That his great heart has room for all the world, And for that million-throated need endures His friends' denial as his own. Were we Not willing, we should not be worthy of him. Bursa. And call you this cold-blooded mask a friend? Publius. If the world take him for its Cæsar, ware; King Stork may make King Log a world's regret. The rigor of his rule already 'gins To gall the people. The army chafes at it. Even the leaders are rebellion-ripe And wait but to be plucked. 'T is love of you More than the King that keeps them faithful now. You'll not believe me; but yourself shall hear The lips of Galahault himself declare it. (To Bursa.) Summon him. Bursa. Officer! [The Officer appears, speaks with Bursa and retires. Meanwhile:] Publius. You shall be king, And the war-wearied world again have peace. Launcelot. I laid aside a crown to follow him. Publius. And Guenevere your queen. ... (Pause.) Launcelot. There spoke the Devil! Publius. You yet shall say I am your better angel. ... Enter Galahault. Sir Launcelot would be assured 't is true That, were he reconciled with Cæsar, half Your armies would come with him. So I told him; So you told me; forsooth, his modesty Will not believe it without confirmation. Galahault. Do not believe that ever I believed You would be aught but Launcelot,—a name That knighthood knows not from itself. Publius. Hold, hold! You gave me reason— Galahault. And for my own ends I did so— Bursa. We are tricked. Publius. Not wholly. Sir, You'll not deny that it is Launcelot, Not Arthur, that the army loves. For him They throw their caps up; and to follow him They would not scruple, lead he where he may. Galahault. All this is true. Publius. They 'd follow him? Galahault. Doubtless. They 'd follow him. Publius. You 'd follow him yourself? Galahault. He knows my love for him. No fault, no crime Could make me leave him. Could he be a traitor,— As he will not,—I'd know that it must be From truth to a higher cause. ... Publius. But should that be? Galahault. I have said all I will. Publius (aside to Bursa). Take him away; And let him not be near the Queen. [Exeunt Bursa and Galahault.] You see, You are the leader; but where'er you lead, He means to follow. With a nice reserve He waits your index, will not speed nor hamper By hint nor shadow of his inner thought The gathering of your true untold desire Into decision,—be it what it may. He leaves you free ... not his to watch the stars, Nor change the helm ... but once your course is set, That's his course, that's the course of the best half Of Arthur's army. Where they'd shrink themselves, With you they would not question; where they'd fear, With you they'd dare damnations, face the unknown, March blindly into darkness, leaving the quarrel Of what they do and why, to you. It is The leader, not the cause, that men believe in; Save now and then a mind—and that's a leader. Launcelot. So much the more must he whom accident Makes leader, try the honor of his deeds, Lest he debase the mint of many hearts. Publius. It is is honor's name I call upon you. I have spoken to you of power; but do not think I hold you one of those who to be crowned Would stoop to be unworthy of a crown ... Yet to be king is good, if worthily ... I have spoken to you of unfettered love; But do not think I hold you such an one As for his pleasure would ride down the rights Of even the poorest peasant in the way. Yet if a great necessity decree We pluck out honor from a fiery shame And pleasure follow for an overplus, What god shall bid us put away that joy? Joy is not in itself an evil thing, But only to make joy our chief concern, Usurping honor's kingship in our hearts. Launcelot. Where is there honor in foul treachery? Publius. Love hath its honor, too. Is there no treason But to your king? Do you owe no allegiance To her of whom the earldoms of your soul Are held by homage? Do you owe no faith To her whom you have put in jeopardy— Even by your love of her—so great that now, Even now, at mere imagination of it, I wonder how your breath can come and go So steadily? Can you condemn the Queen, With this impassive face, to wrong and shame,— Yield that proud spirit to the bitterness Of contumely,—let the scavenger crows Of court and camp perch upon her fair name And pick the white bones of her murdered honor? Why, after that the body's death were nought; And yet that she should die in agonies, That supreme miracle of flesh be given To the red flames to scar and shrivel and blacken Into a mummied horror, while the slow nerves, Shrieking with dilatory pangs— Launcelot. What mean you? Publius. Burned at the stake,—so reads your Briton law, For the high treason of adultery In queens. The annals of your country tell That Goneril, the wife of Calader, Endured that punishment. It is the law. You know well that King Arthur, even if he Were judge of his own sons as Brutus was, Holds the integrity of the ordered state So high above the individual life He would not flinch one comma of the law. Burned at the stake—will he do violence To the law, his god, to save her? Launcelot. He is just. Publius. And pitiless. He would not, though he loved her. And will he love her, when he knows the truth? Worse in his eyes than faithless to himself, The insulter of his crown! ... Or will he spare her For your sake, who betrayed him with a kiss? ... There is a justice so implacable Wrong is not so unjust. Will you leave her To the mercy of that justice? Sir, her safety Is at your will. If you betray her, what Remains? No hope ... unless in the protection Of Cæsar. Launcelot. Cæsar? Publius. Cæsar ... and Cæsar's love! She is within our lines, a prisoner; For, knowing of her coming from her letter, The Emperor had an ambush set and seized her. He will defend her, but he will ask payment,— Her love ... or else your sword. What, do you still Hesitate? If the Emperor should fall, After the Queen were made his concubine, And she should fall again in Arthur's hands? ... Her beauty hath so wrought on Cæsar's eyes That only for the great respect he bears you And for the hope that he may win your sword Does he delay his pleasure. Scorn our friendship, You give her proud fame to be spat upon, Her body to the fire ... or Cæsar's arms ... Or both perhaps, if Arthur conquer Cæsar. ... Are you a man, and can hear this unmoved? I'll not believe it. I myself am stirred Almost to tears for pity of her lot. If you are not to passion, then, poor lady, She is indeed forsaken. You forget, Perhaps, the empire of her loveliness, And time and distance have made dull your love. But when you see her rise into your sight, Supreme and radiant as Orion, when The silent horror of her beauty pleads Against her doom, then, then each word of mine Will, like the dragon's teeth that Cadmus sowed, Crop armed invasion in your soul and peal Her cause with trumpets.—Ho, there! Bring forth the Queen! ... Why, now you start. Ay, sir, the Queen is here. I'll leave you with her. When you look on her, Think of the fire ... and think of Cæsar's love ... Think of the smell of burning flesh ... and then The silken scented luxury ... the hush Of secret dusky chambers ... and the glare Of flame upon the faces of the crowd. ... Enter Guenevere. Exit Publius. Launcelot. Guenevere! Guenevere. Launcelot! Launcelot. Thou art more beautiful even than my dreams of thee. Guenevere. I am more glad of thee than even my heart foreknew. Launcelot. Man is not God enough that his weak dreams, Even from thy shadow in his memory, Should mould so beautiful a world as thou. Guenevere. Thou standest tall between me and the sky, Most like a spirit. Art thou real, love? Launcelot. As real as the gleam of thee that plays Across the night like starlight on a pool, Swift witchery and the dark deeps underneath. Guenevere. My heart is deep with calm and light with joy. Launcelot. Thou art a night of mystery and stars. [Pause.] Guenevere. I think the whole world is a song of love; I think the whole world swims with lyric joy. Launcelot. Thy voice is like a still star sped across the hush. Guenevere. There is another voice that cools out of the night. Launcelot. The angel of our love ... It has been long ... How great a mystery you seem to me I cannot tell. You seem to have become One with the tides and night and the unknown ... My child ... your child ... whence come?—by what strange forge Wrought of ourselves and dreams and the great deep Into a life? I feel as if I stood Where God had passed by, leaving all the place Aflame with him. Guenevere. How tell the secrets of His coming—the weird vibrance of the room, As if the chords of ghostly violins Thrilled into looming dreams where'er you came. From the beginning, ere he was conceived, The air was quick with him. Launcelot. The strangeness is That I, who have not borne him, am aware, I too, of intimacy with his soul. It is as I were just awaked from sleep And one should tell me of events that passed While I was sleeping, and I knew them not; Yet at each word confused memories Stir somewhere deeper than the waking mind, And I am conscious that I was a part Of things I knew not of. Guenevere. He is watched over; Where he is, one is brushed by the unseen, And the air thickens with the hush of shadows. Launcelot. What will he be? My thought leaps to the future And pictures him a thousand different ways, But always something starred above his fellows. Guenevere. Oh, do not haste the heavy-footed years. Let him live out his pudgy dimpled life— Dear baby—without fret of what's to be. Other lives ... boyhood, manhood ... in their turn! I want him as he is. What will make up For those ten little aimless fingers? Who Will ever give me back his helplessness? Launcelot. His babyhood is not so real to me As he is. You have seen him. Is he like you? Guenevere. He is like you. Launcelot. I think he is like you; And you forget to look for it in him, Losing remembrance of yourself in me, I have not seen him. Guenevere. I may never see him ... Launcelot. Your face is beautiful as one who thinks Of death, with seaward eyes. Guenevere. It is worth all. I know the rapture now the martyrs had, When this was Nero's and Domitian's Rome. I would not yield a pang of any woe That I have suffered, so wrought into one The pain is with the vision and the joy, The peace and all the wonder of your soul. Launcelot. We are more far off from the world of ills Than Vega or Arcturus from our feet. I feel as if it were some other I That captains Arthur's army, moves, speaks, thinks,— Some machine curiously made half alive, Whose very feelings are mechanical. But when what somehow seems to be indeed I, lifts its head above the waves, I know That all that turmoil does not rive nor jar The bases of my soul. [A bugle, far off, faintly.] Guenevere. Oh, how alone We are, as if the stars and only we Watched in the darkness! [Pause.] Launcelot. What is it that gleams Like a coil of wan light in your eddying hair? Guenevere. A silver serpent. Ylen gave it me In Lyonesse. Launcelot. You used to wear a dagger. Guenevere. They took it from me. Launcelot. Oh, your hair, your hair! It is like dark water in a little light. ... Oh, your beautiful hair, Guenevere! I let my fingers drown in it ... Oh, I let my soul drown in it, Guenevere. [A noise without, as of a shield that clangs falling to the ground.] Guenevere. Oh, what was that? Launcelot. A soldier's shield that fell. Guenevere. I thought it was a summons to my soul. Launcelot. The whole night seems unearthly and remote, And every common thing a prodigy. Guenevere. The earth and air are tense and augural, And tremulous with the unseen. I think It is our souls that thus compel the night. Launcelot. Oh, your beautiful hands, Guenevere! They are like moonlight lying on my arm. [Kisses her hands; and then her cheek and throat, passionately. A wind rises, and stirs gustily in the trees.] Guenevere. Oh, the wind, the wind! It blows against my face As if the night were waking. Launcelot. Look at me! I want to look deep down into your eyes. I want to find your soul down in your eyes. I want to find your kisses in your soul. Guenevere. Oh, you are like the passion of the morning When all the kissed earth wakens into life. Launcelot. I worship you, I worship you, I worship you,— As a saint worships heaven I worship you; You ray the darkness like the starry heaven, And like the raptured woods I worship you ... Guenevere. No ... somewhere deeper than all me and thee ... Launcelot. Oh, your beautiful soul, Guenevere! ... Varro (without). Sir Launcelot! Guenevere. Who calls! Launcelot. Ha! It is Varro's voice. Enter Varro. Varro. The morning wind arises and the east Is faintly gray. My duty that you be Safely within your lines before the dawn Narrows the time. When will it please you start? Launcelot. Why, now. [Exit Varro]. There is no time but is both well And ill. [Kisses her; then detaches his dagger and passes it to her silently. She conceals it.] Enter Publius; and Varro, Bursa, Galahault, and Soldiers in the background. A pause. Publius. Well, are you friends with Cæsar? Launcelot. No. Curtain. ACT V. Scene. Rome. A Room in Guenevere's Apartment in the Palace of Lucius. Large window-doors at back, open. Balcony beyond, overlooking the gardens, and the streets of Rome. Voconius and Voconia, meeting. Voconius. Is the Queen stirring yet? Voconia. She is at breakfast. I came here, as you ordered. Tell me why You yield your former plans so suddenly— How comes it that you give commands in the palace?— What has happened that 't is Guenevere, not I, You scheme for Cæsar now? ... Voconius. The Emperor Will be here in a moment. Let the Queen Know he is coming... Oh, Voconia, Our fortunes are at the top. Publius and Bursa Have fallen, they have fallen, they are overthrown, And I am nearest Cæsar! ... Voconia. What has happened? Voconius. It seems they blundered in some enterprise To win Sir Launcelot to us ... Cæsar is furious. ... He has thrown Publius into a dungeon— And Galahault—Bursa has not returned To the palace yet. ... Voconia. Galahault? Voconius. Galahault, too; He did not say what was expected of him. Cæsar would scourge the soldiers that went with them, Pillory the pikes, so bitter is his rage. Voconia. Let Galahault be released. Voconius. Still in that tune? ... Why, if you will ... my power will reach that far— Not were it Publius—and since it thwarts Success no longer, love him if you like— Love twenty, love the army! Only stay With Guenevere, report her thoughts to me, And, as you may, incline her thoughts to Cæsar. Enter Lucius. Go, tell her that the Emperor is here. [Exit Voconia.] Lucius. What says she? Voconius. That she finds the Queen is calm, Does not avoid your name, but speaks of you With courtesy, if not with tenderness. Believe me, she'll do much. Lucius. Why, that is good. Voconius. But asks her price. Lucius. They all do that. What is it? Voconius. That which I think you will not wish to grant, But yet may grant without too great a loss,— The release of Galahault. Lucius. No, by the empire! Voconius. Remember he is not as Publius, A fruitless servant, but an open foe— To be watched, guarded, spied on, not to be punished. Consider, too, 't were well Voconia Should be your debtor ... True, we may command her; You are her emperor, I am her brother, Head of her house; but you'd have service of her That's not to be compelled. She is in love With Galahault; her gratitude and joy Will bind her to your cause. Lucius. Let him go free; [Voconius sits at table and writes.] Enter Voconia. But I'll have double vengeance on the others. Voconius. Your signature. [Lucius signs the release.] Voconia. The Queen regrets she must Beg Cæsar to attend a little while. Voconius. This will release Sir Galahault. See you to it. [Exit Voconia.] Lucius. I'll find some way to make them plead to purpose. Bursa, whom I have— Enter a Messenger. Well! What is it? Speak! Is your news pepper? Does it strangle you? Messenger. Most mighty— Lucius. Well, well, lobster! Messenger. The enemy Storms the Flaminian Gate. Lucius. What! Where's Bursa? Messenger. Gone to the walls, to captain the defence. [Exit, upon a gesture from Lucius.] Lucius. Why do they strike to-day? Fools! ... I have need Of Bursa; that must be deferred. Voconius,— Voconius. Cæsar! Lucius. Publius is imprisoned in the crypt? Voconius. Ay, Cæsar. Lucius. He will not sleep well there. Voconius. Truly, the flags are hard. Lucius. And cold. I'd have him sleep. The old man has not closed his eyes all night. See that he sleeps soon. Voconius. He shall sleep sound, my lord. Lucius. See to it now ... Where is my secretary? Voconius. I have a slave attends me here in the gallery, That has great skill in writing. Lucius. Bring him with you When you return. Be quickly here again. ... [Exit Voconius.] Enter Metella. He was grown irksome, and his grip on the empire Was too tentacular. Metella. Cæsar! Lucius. Well, it is done; Let him teach Lucifer diplomacy ... Metella. Cæsar ... Lucius. Well done, I doubt. ... Metella. There was a time I had no need to call on Cæsar thrice. Have I grown husky, that my voice no more Bells clear across the thicket of your moods? Lucius. You have a sweet voice, madam. Metella. Cæsar! ... Lucius. Tears!— How difficult it is to deal with women!— Why, you are beautiful, and you are clever, And you are charming, madam. Who denies it? Metella. Oh, deny it a thousand times—and kiss me! Lucius. There! Metella. No! I am not so facile, Lucius. Lucius. That 's well done, too. (Aside.) If my thoughts had the time, A look like that would halt them. She's a fine woman. ... Enter Voconius and Dagonet. Is this your scribe? Voconius. Ay, Cæsar. Lucius. Let him wait Within call. I've a paper presently I would have copied quickly. A word with you. Your pardon, madam ... Dagonet. Caught at last! Oh for a cap to make me invisible! (Looking out at balcony.) Or even an every-day ladder; I am a two-legged animal, but without feathers; it's too high for a wingless fowl. [Withdraws upon balcony.] Lucius (apart to Voconius). That's done, then. ... You are a handsome man, Voconius. Voconius. Cæsar knows not to flatter, otherwise— Lucius. See you Metella yonder? ... How her neck Curves like an angry swan's! Voconius. A lovely cloud,— Rainbowed and opal-smouldering. Lucius. Is she not A prize for princes? Voconius. I envy you, my lord. Lucius. Oh, fear no jealousy from me, Voconius. Take her, if you can win her. ... Pardon us, madam. Cæsar is more a slave than all his slaves; His tyrant is the State. What news, Voconius? How goes the battle at the barrier? Voconius. Like two strong wrestlers locked in a mad grip That budge not though their bones cry,—like the sea That breaks unyielding on the unyielding cliff! The messengers come momently, but bring No news of change. Bursa would have you forth Thinking your presence may inspire the troops. Lucius. I will put on my armor presently. [Looks off at balcony.] Metella. It must be a brave sight. Voconius. Would you look on? I can convey you to a place of vantage Whence you may see all and yet be as safe As at the theatre. It will be rare. Metella. I am not in the mood. Voconius. Oh, madam, come. It will divert you—at the least, it may be Some pleasure to you that 't is much to me. Metella. Why, you may go. Voconius. Oh, madam, I but go To pick the crumbs up of your scattered glances. Metella. Speak low, lest Cæsar hear. Voconius. A fig for Cæsar! Metella. Why, that's a man. Well then, I'll go with you. [Exeunt Metella and Voconius.] Lucius. Ho, there! Attend me. ... Enter two Attendants. She is beautiful. I wonder why she does not stir me now. ... Go, bid my armor-bearer have my harness In readiness ... [Exit an Attendant. A little later in the scene he re-enters unobtrusively.] Upon my soul, this Queen Treats me right queenly. Will she never come? ... Enter Guenevere. You give me hopes. No maiden e'er drew out The fever of her lover's waiting longer While she, in tremor half and half in craft, Played witchery with her glass. You give me hopes. Guenevere. The mirror of a woman is the eyes Of all the world—including emperors. Lucius. Why, every eye must be your mirror—true— For all eyes turn to you where'er you go. But some are dull—a fool's thought cannot glass you; And some are flawed—a wry heart would distort you; And many are of too base metal made To hang in your bedchamber. Guenevere. Rather than hang Base metal there, though with the empire gilded, Lucretia's steel should serve. Lucius. Death of my life! Base metal, madam! Guenevere. Counterfeit—it passes. Lucius. Provoke me not to leave all generous thoughts. Guenevere. Spare me your generosity. You make A merchandise of magnanimity. Lucius. Remember, madam, you are in my power. Guenevere. O generous, to make me think of it! Lucius. Oh, how the ugly lines of scorn grow fair When 't is your face that wears them! Ah, you make A grace of things ungracious! You shall yet Smooth out the wrinkle of that lithe contempt To something gentler. You shall crook that pride, And humble that disdain. Know you this letter? ... It seems you do not. Let me hold it nearer. ... Guenevere. That! ... oh! ... Lucius. Bid me tear it ... Guenevere. Fool! fool! fool! I knew it when I wrote it. What fiend, then, Usurped my soul to send it? Oh, what drug, What basilisk, what Gorgon sorceried My judgment into stone? Are we the sport Of something in ourselves that makes our wills Pygmies that stand on mountain-tops and brag? Oh! ... Lucius. Bid me tear it! ... Guenevere. I have nought to do With what you do or do not. Lucius. Drive me not To be a tyrant where I would be kind. Give me your hand and seal we amity With the ashes of this telltale. Guenevere. You are slow To understand. Lucius. Methinks I know you better Than you had thought. Put off this vestal role; I know you no Lucretia,—ts! one more Or less—what matter? Guenevere (after an angry pause). What one matters all ... How should you understand me? I have done. Lucius. I have not. If you stand on faithfulness, I'll hold you to it: this belongs to him, then, You are bound-to to be faithful ... Do you take me? I speak of Arthur. Shall I send you to him And ticket you with this? ... I do not jest. By God's blood, I will send you to his camp And bid my herald cry your shame at large. God's mercy, madam, you are no such saint To be so liberal of scorn! ... No speech? You will break silence when you see the copy Made ready to be sent—oh, I keep this; But all may see it ... Once more, bid me delay ... Ho, there, you writing fellow! Enter Dagonet. Copy this. Dagonet (aside). Copy it? Oh, Lord! Lucius. Will you take it, knave? Dagonet. Ay, Cæsar, ay, ay,—but my quills are split. Lucius. Fetch what he needs. [Attendants fetch writing materials.] It is not yet too late ... Here, rascal, take it. Well, what lack you now? Dagonet. Tinder to light the taper for the wax. Lucius. Serve him ... Madam, the time grows lean apace. You were not made for rigor. Your lush South Of beauty's not for winter ... Take it ... [Dagonet takes letter, Lucius turns again to Guenevere.] Dagonet (recognizing the letter). Whoop! [Lights it with taper.] Lucius. Be kind and bid me burn it. [Follows Guenevere's startled look and sees Dagonet with the burning letter.] Lucius. What! Thou—Who? ... Dagonet. Your only juggler, sire. Do you remember? ... [Kneels and kisses Guenevere's hand.] Lucius. Guards, ho! Hell-fire and brimstone! Guards! ... Enter a Messenger, precipitately. Messenger. My lord, The enemy have burst the gates. Lucius. What sayest thou? Messenger. The walls are carried and the battle wages Along the streets. Bursa— Lucius. My armor, ho! Guenevere. This way, with me. [Exeunt Guenevere and Dagonet.] Lucius. Where is the fighting? Come! Conduct me ... Seize that fellow! Gone? Damnation! Find him, and hang him! ... What's the way? my armor! ... [Exeunt all severally. Pause. Noises without.] Enter Voconia and Galahault. Voconia. I asked for life, but did not know how great And wonderful life was. Galahault. I thought that life Was ended, and the rest mere dragging out The dead accustomed days. Voconia. I know so little, And you so much. How can you love me? Galahault. Oh, You bring me what I thought I had lost forever, Youth of the soul. I live in you again, And re-discover all things. [Kisses her.] Voconia. Kiss me again ... [A pause.] Galahault. What noise is that! I hear the clash of arms. [They run to the open window-doors.] Voconia. Oh, oh, oh! They are battering the gates! Galahault. They storm the palace! God, to be cooped up here! Voconia. But with me, love ... Galahault. You are my new life—look! You would not have me less a soldier. Heavens! Look, look, I say. [The noises increase.] Voconia. They are bursting the gates in ... Galahault. And I not there! Oh, some way to escape! ... Voconia. The gates give way! ... Ah! ... Ah! ... Ah! Who is he With the yellow hair, that lifts the gates and hurls them Like rotten wood? ... Galahault. Launcelot! Launcelot! ... Voconia. Oh, it is glorious! ... Galahault. How escape? ... How join them? ... Voconia. You have no arms. Galahault. The dead shall give me arms. Voconia. Look, look again! ... Ah! ... Oh, horrible! ... See, Bursa comes now ... Ah, look, Launcelot— Galahault. They are but a handful that have dashed ahead ... They will be overcome— Voconia. Not he! He fights As if some madness hurled him. Galahault. Help me reach him. You know the palace. Is there no way to descend But through the Romans? Voconia. Follow me. This way. [Exeunt into the inner rooms of Guenevere. Uproar in garden, and on staircase, bursting finally into the apartment.] Enter several fighting. Then Bursa and Launcelot in hand to hand struggle, with battle-axes. Cries, tumult. The Romans increase in numbers and drive out the Britons. Launcelot is wounded. He reels back a moment, then returns to the combat, and Bursa is slain. Romans (dispersedly). Seize him! ... Take him prisoner! ... He is alone. It is Launcelot ... [They rush upon Launcelot in a body, but stagger back under the blows of his battle-axe and huddle together at the door-way, ready to escape. Several are wounded and one slain. As they stand, wavering, in the door, Launcelot, growing weak from the bleeding of his wound, lets fall his arm to his side, dropping his battle-axe, and then half falls to the floor.] A Roman. He is wounded. Quick, a surgeon! Let us take him alive. It is their general. [Exeunt several.] Launcelot (aside, faintly). Where is she? ... Another Roman. Yield you, rescue or no rescue. Third Roman. Your men are beaten back. First Roman. You are left alone. [Launcelot faints.] Those who had gone out re-enter with a Surgeon. Surgeon. He is faint from loss of blood. Quick, bring me wine. First Roman. Cæsar should know. Who'll go and seek out Cæsar? [Exeunt several. The Surgeon dresses the wound, and applies bandages, with tourniquet knot to stop bleeding.] Second Roman. We shall all be centurions. Capture Launcelot! ... [Wine is brought.] Surgeon. He is coming to. [Launcelot sits up partly and the Surgeon gives him wine to drink.] Enter Lucius, in armor, and Soldiers. Lucius. Where is he? ... Bind him fast. Surgeon. He is too weak to struggle. Lucius. Bind him fast! ... [Launcelot is bound.] Give him more wine to drink. I'd have him roused Enough to speak with me. Surgeon. He is still dazed. [Launcelot drinks.] He must be quiet lest he bleed afresh ... [Holding his pulse.] He is better now. Launcelot. Bound? Lucius. Clear this dirt away. Leave us alone. [Exeunt Soldiers, bearing the dead bodies.] So, so, Sir Launcelot! What though your soldiers riot in my streets? We've not done yet. Enter Varro. Varro. All's lost. The city's theirs. Lucius. No! ... No! ... No! ... Varro. Our men scatter like rats. All 's vain to rally them. Lucius. The city lost? Deny it, man, deny it. Oh! the world melts Out of my hands like snow. No, all's not lost! Cowards, you leave me—you betray me—Ah!— I had no Launcelots! Varro. Be it so, you wrong us. We have fought well. They sweep the streets like hail. King Arthur, like an Ajax come again,— I think he is a god,—I cannot kill him! Thrice have I fought with him, and thrice—... All's lost! Remains but to secure your flight, my lord. Lucius. Where shall I flee to? For the world is his. ... [To the Surgeon.] Open this vein for me ... An easy death; I have considered it, Varro. [Suddenly and infuriate his eye falling Launcelot.] No, not that way! Vengeance! We will have vengeance in our ruin! Draw up your soldiers at the garden walls And rampart me with death. I shall be there. [Exeunt Varro and Surgeon.] [Guenevere appears at the door of the inner rooms. Seeing first Lucius, and then Launcelot, she stops, silent. Lucius breaks into an hysterical laugh, and starts sinuously, and with malign intention, toward her. Launcelot strains at the cords that bind him. Guenevere motionless till Lucius has passed Launcelot, who at that moment with a violent effort bursts the cords. As Guenevere turns to Launcelot, Lucius with a quick movement snatches the dagger from her and flings it on the floor.] Lucius. Madam, he's bound ... and wounded. [Launcelot springs upon Lucius and grapples with him.] Launcelot. Roman beast! [They wrestle towards the balcony.] Lucius. Ugh! Ugh! ... Ah! ... Help! ... Ho! ... Aee! ... aee! ... aee! ... [As they reach the doors, Launcelot lifts Lucius bodily and rushing out upon the balcony, with the strength of fury, hurls him down upon the paved court below. A cry of terror, like the cry of a wild beast, from Lucius as he disappears.] Launcelot. Rot there! I would 't were in our Norland woods For the lean wolves to rend thee! Guenevere. Is he slain? Moves he? Oh— Launcelot. He will never move again. [Groans of dismay from the garden. Then outcries. Confusion.] Ho! ... Ho! ... you Romans ... There lies your Cæsar—such a senseless lump His very dogs insult him! Yield you, knaves! Now comes an Emperor that is to that As morning to the foul glow of the Pit! Yield you! Now come the old heroic days When Rome was Rome and ruled by right divine Of valor and devotion. Rejoice, cry out, Shout “Arthur! Arthur! There's a Cæsar indeed— Greater than the great Julius—who shall found An empire greater still!” ... Throw ope the gates, Rush out, and make your peace. [Turns to Guenevere. Tumult without, then quiet. Guenevere stretches out her hands and comes towards him, breaking into overflow of joyous silvery laughter. She stops at the steps that rise to the doors opening on the balcony and he comes down to her, laughing too, for sheer joy. As he reaches her at the steps he reels, weak with loss of blood, and falls.] My wound! I am spent. Tie up this knot again. ... Undo my armor. ... [She takes off his helmet and corselet, and re-dresses the wound deftly and quickly.] Guenevere. So wounded, Launcelot, ... and to outthew The scarce-breathed Lucius! Launcelot. It is but a slash. The bleeding makes me weak. But oh! oh! oh! The victory, the victory, Guenevere! ... Since last night it is thrice a thousand years, And every year a hell. Guenevere. A Lapland night, Launcelot. Ne'er morning dawned so slow. Guenevere. But now, but now—! Launcelot. Now we are past all ills. ... And I could thank Some truculent Roman if he brake in on us And slew us ere they come. Ay, to cease thus, Together, at the height! Guenevere. No, not to cease, But to be thus, forever! Launcelot. Ah, to know You are no longer in that tiger's clutch, I—I—ha, ha, ha, ha! Guenevere. Speak not of him,— A fool that met a fool's fate. ... Hear the bells! ... [Chimes of bells begin to ring all over the city; at first, those faint and far away, then nearer and louder.] How like a fleet of shining pinnaces They sail upon the air. ... Hark! clear and sweet! ... It is our bridal that they ring, and we Are wed anew to-day. Launcelot. Nearer and nearer They swell with joy. They ease my heart of joy. Guenevere. Oh, I think they are alive! I think They are glad with our gladness! They rejoice That life is fair and that the sun is sweet And all the little winds are soft with joy. ... How they peal forth! ... Launcelot. Victory! Guenevere! It is the churches ringing the Te Deum! Rome hails her victor—and her emperor! [Shouts and noises in the garden.] Guenevere. Hear them cry out! Launcelot. Is it their men or ours? [A pause.] Guenevere. Launcelot! Launcelot. Guenevere! Guenevere. Hark! ... Launcelot. They are on the stair. [A pause.] Guenevere. There 's some one at the door. ... Enter Arthur. A pause. Arthur. Ho, are you here? ... Lady, you are the Empress of the world To-day. What, wounded, Launcelot? Not badly? Launcelot. 'T is nothing, Arthur. Arthur. God 's my life, 't is much, For you are pale with it. But it becomes you. Crowns are not won with kisses. ... Well, we've won ... There 's salve for all our cuts—eh, Launcelot? Enter Lionel, Dinadan, Galahault, and Knights. Dinadan. Ho, ho! a prize! we have taken our own general. We found Sir Galahault in the streets, half-armed, Fighting as a starved man falls to victuals. Mass, [Thumping him on the back.] I think he's only twenty. Galahault (to Guenevere). Where is Voconia? Guenevere. Yonder. [Exit Galahault.] He has taken Rome the happiest way. Arthur. What, by her maidens? That's a knight's part, too. Lionel. The city's mad with joy. Our partisans Build bonfires in the streets, and our late foes Forget their enmity and cry as loud As our own men for Arthur. “Peace” is the shout; The frenzy spreads like a contagion. Dinadan. Yes, They'll all be drunk by night, Pagan or Christian. Enter Bors, Ector, and others, with Varro. Launcelot. Varro? ... Arthur, this Roman is my friend. Arthur. Let him go free. (To Varro.) I crave you for my service. ... Bors. The people throng the churches, where they sing Te Deums for your victory. Ector. We passed Bands of monks chanting in the squares. Bors. They say The Pope himself comes hither with his blessing. Re-enter Galahault, with Voconia, and Dagonet in an improvised costume. Laughter at Dagonet's entrance. Dagonet. You laugh, masters. But this is the badge of a free man. I have put off slavery with my Roman clothes. These are the spoils of war. I have looted the ladies' apartments. My cap was a work-basket; my bauble a distaff and a doll's head, artistically united. I despoiled the female slaves of them. My doublet is patched together of ladies' mantles, and my hose—oh, la, la! Guenevere. Tut, tut! You are a silly Fool. Go to! Arthur. We must soon turn our steps again to Britain; And one of you must rule for us in Rome. Who should this be but he whose arm was chief To throne us here? You all do know the love I bear him ... but you shall confess me just When I name Launcelot. [Cheers.] Launcelot. Oh, not me, my King! [A pause. Chanting without, in the garden.] Arthur. You shall be honored only as you please And name your own prize. Launcelot. This is my prize, Arthur— To see you here in triumph. Arthur. That 's well said. I understand you. It is nobly felt. We stay together, then. ... Well, Galahault, You are half Roman, as it seems, already,— What is the throng that breaks upon us here? [The scene crowds with spectators, Romans and Britons. The chanting of the monks draws nearer in the corridor.] Monks (without). Salvum fac populum tuum, Domine et benedic hæreditati tuæ Et rege eos, et extolle illos usque in æternum. Per singulos dies benedicimus te. Et laudamus nomen tuum in sæculum et in sæculum sæculi, Dignare, Domine, die isto sine peccato nos custodire. Enter a procession of monks, in white cowls, chanting; then acolytes, and the Pope, in a cope of cloth of gold, with the tiara on his head. Miserere nostri, Domine miserere nostri, Fiat misericordia tua, Domine, super nos quemadmodum speravimus in te. In te, Domine, speravi non confundar in æternum. [As they cease chanting, the Pope raises his hands in benediction. All kneel.] The Pope. God's blessing lie upon you, Christian knights, And upon thee, my son, deliverer Of his church and his people. ... King of Britain, Be thou God's holy Emperor of Rome. Behold the Iron Crown! I, being God's vicar Over the church, crown thee to be his vicar Over the world. ... Behold your Cæsar, Rome! Launcelot (rising). Long live the Emperor! All (rising). Long live the Emperor! Arthur (Setting the crown, for an instant, upon Guenevere's head). Long live the Empress! All. Ho! Long live the Empress! Enter a Messenger. Messenger. Letters, my lord, from Merlin. ... This for the queen. [He delivers the letters, which Arthur and Guenevere, severally, open and scan.] Guenevere (apart to Launcelot). All's well with him. Curtain. IV. TALIESIN A MASQUE PERSONS.

Second Movement.—Helicon. Third Movement.—The Chapel of the Graal. FIRST MOVEMENT. The Forest of Broceliande. Taliesin lies asleep under the thick-leaved trees, a harp by his side. The voices of unseen Spirits are heard, singing. Voices. Here falls no light of sun nor stars; No stir nor striving here intrudes; No moan nor merrymaking mars The quiet of these solitudes. Submerged in sleep, the passive soul Is one with all the things that seem; Night blurs in one confusèd whole Alike the dreamer and the dream. O dwellers in the busy town! For dreams you smile, for dreams you weep. Come out, and lay your burdens down! Come out; there is no God but Sleep. [The branches are pressed apart, and the young knight, Sir Percival, pushes his way through them. Percival. No path, no beacon of directing stars, No outlet from perpetual wandering! Three days have I sought vainly through this wood; And yet I fear to sleep. The heavy air Enwraps me with a drowsiness so strange I dare not yield to it.—What youth is this? A minstrel, by his harp. Alas, he sleeps As if he ne'er would wake again. Soho! Awake! lest you should sleep into your death. Taliesin (awaking). Dreams, but I fain would know wherefore we dream. Percival. Shake off your slumber now and answer me. I am Sir Percival, three days ago Made Knight of the Round Table. Who art thou? Taliesin. I was the bard at Elphin's court, whose realm The encroaching sea o'erthrew. And now I go To seek the halls of Arthur, for a bard Must live at courts, and where the life of men Is densest and the struggle is most fierce. Percival. Men speak at Camelot of Taliesin, And call him the new Merlin. Ay, the King Himself has spoken of you, and I know That you will be right welcome. But how comes it That you are here so far from the right way? Taliesin. This is the mystic wood where Merlin lies In his enchanted sleep. My master he, And of him I seek counsel. Percival. And I too. Three days have I sought for him in this wood, And seen no living thing, nor heard no sound But murmurs that entice me to a sleep Wherefrom I shrink. I took this quest upon me, Being heartsore with the scandals of the court. Taliesin. Scandals, at the court of the blameless King? Percival. Sir, I perceive you know us as we seem, Not as we are. And for the King himself, Save rumors of strange sins wrought long ago, I know no charge against him. But his court, Even the high order of the Table Round, That was for an ensample edified Of manhood at its highest, holiest reach,— It has become a house of infamy. Ere I was made a knight, the sin I saw Made the light harsh and the air stifling to me; And then I vowed that my first knightly quest Should be to find some rescue from the sin. Voices. Sleep, and renounce the vital day; For evil is the child of life. Let be the will to live, and pray To find forgetfulness of strife. Beneath the thicket of these leaves No light discriminates each from each. No Self that wrongs, no Self that grieves Hath longer deed nor creed nor speech. Sleep on the mighty Mother's breast! Sleep, and no more be separate! Then, one with Nature's ageless rest, There shall be no more sin to hate. Taliesin. Again—the slumber gains upon my eyes As gently as night rises on the hills. Percival. Arouse you! Hither came we not to sleep; And to my ears these voices, like the scent Of poisonous orient flowers, albeit sweet, Are heavy with the drowsiness of death. Taliesin. Death hath no terrors if he come like this, Fondling the soul to sleep with lingering touch. Percival. No sleep for us, on whom the weight is laid Of many labors. Yet what way to turn Or by what art or speech or master deed To find the Seer where he lies entranced That know I not. Taliesin (seizing his harp). But that I know, nor longer Shall these seducing spirits have power on me. Listen, for now I rule them in my turn. [He touches the strings of his harp, and at the sound the other murmurs are still. He sings: Spirits of Sleep, That swell and sink In the sea of Being Like waves on the deep, Forming, crumbling, Fumbling, and tumbling Forever, unseeing, From brink to brink! Perishing voices, That call and call From the coves of dream With hollow noises! I hear the sweep Of the tides of sleep, The ocean stream Where the ages fall. But not for these Will I let me die, Though my heart remembers The calling seas; For the cycles fought Till form was wrought And Might had members And I was I. Yet still to you, O Dreams, I turn; Not with a prayer But a bidding to do! I surmount and subdue you; Not without you but through you I shall forge and fare To the chosen bourne. Voices. We are ware of a will Cries “Peace, be still!” And our waters cease To a troubled peace. Taliesin. Lo, star upon star! They dwell alone— Sirius, Altair, Algebar! Their ways are asunder,— Aloof, in thunder They march and flare From zone to zone. But the formless ether Far and far Enfolds their places. Therein together At one they sweep From deep to deep, And over its spaces Star calls to star. Through its waves they reach Beyond their spheres To their fellow fires. Each yearns to each, And the straight wills swerve To a yielding curve, And a moth's desires Deflect the years. And with urge on urge Of the rippling wave Light speeds through space; The domes emerge; And the halls of Night Behold each light Reveal his face To the vast conclave The centred Soul By these is known. Its will it wreaks At its own control; But dumb, unseeing, The sea of Being Washes the peaks Where it strives alone. Voices. As the dawn awaits The recoiling gates Of the eastern air, We are calm and hear. Taliesin. O vast of Sleep Wherein we grew! Whence wrench by wrench Self heaved its steep! The bond abides; Your mighty tides Still clasp and clench The soul to you. In your darks indwelling The lonely Mind Regains its deeps. Therethrough the compelling Gravitation of soul Decrees control, And with far leaps Knits kind to kind. Through your floods of dream The warm love glows; And its live light streaming Beam on beam Bares each to each As sight nor speech Nor deed nor deeming Could e'er disclose. For save in you (Strange under-life!) We can but trust If the world be true, Or if our vision Be but derision, The smoke and dust Of a phantom strife. Oh, then, to gain The eternal streams! Nor fail as flakes In the gulfing main! No lordship losing, To fare on, fusing The self that wakes And the self that dreams! For so shall my calling Compel to me The dumb, the distant, The unrecalling, Through ways that darken To hie and hearken And unresistant Their dooms decree. So shall my word Yearn forth and reach Where Merlin lies, Far, still, unstirred Of birth or dying. Yea, at my crying The dead shall rise And grant me speech. O Merlin, master, Hear my prayer! We grope and palter, And thick disaster Besets our ways In the wood of days Wherein we falter From snare to snare. One hour awake From your magic sleep, And point us where Are the paths to take; Till in your musing We find for choosing The deeds to dare And the laws to keep. [A diffused light appears in the background. It gathers and defines to a luminous sphere. Voices. He hath spoken our names; And we yield as flames That are wild or still At the wind's will. [The forms of Merlin and Nimue gradually become visible in the light. Nimue. He sleeps; The ancient Mother o'er him croons The lull of her recurring runes; And in his heart he keeps The calm of silent moons. For him no vital Avalon, No still-aspiring Paradise! He sought it not; at peace he lies, Nor hears the years stride on. On earth two only held his heart, And with these two his soul abides. For here reluctant Nature hides No more her secret; he is part Of her most unconfided whim, And here in dreams I visit him. O ye for whom the forest has no fears! O thou whose voice is strong To quell the night with song! Speak; for he hears. Taliesin. Wakest thou, then, O Merlin? Merlin. Nay, I sleep. Taliesin. And yet thou hearest? Merlin. I hear thee in my dream. Who art thou? Taliesin. One that ere thou knewest sleep, Chose thee for master; for I heard the hills Reverb thy music, and the druid trees Speak with thy voice and take thy thought upon them. And still I hearten mine own song with thine, And on the lonely crags repeat thy runes And fill my lungs with thunders. But to me Speak thou not yet. I am but as my harp Whereon a Hand makes music; thou, the last Of the antique wholeness and heroic height, Bard, ruler, prophet, like the sacred oak, With stir of lyric rumor in thy leaves, Shadowest the mysteries of the hidden gods. Give answer first to him that comes with me, Who seeks to rule his deeds; then to my cry, Who am the horn blown on his battlefield. Merlin. The horn blown is a deed. I know thee now And him that comes with thee. (To Percival.) Brave-hearted boy, Though not for thee to know the mysteries, Be of good heart; thou also shalt attain. Thou shalt behold the ripe fruit on the tree, Though the earth send its riches through the sap Without thy ken; and thy right hand shall guard The fruit from evil, and thy lips shall taste Its savor. From this place the earth-goddess, Even Nimue, whom thou beholdest here, Shall bear thee to a castle far away Where the Graal-lord, King Evelac, abides; A marvel shall be shown thee there, and all, Lawful to speak, be told thee. Percival. Must I leave My comrade then? Merlin. Heed not; but, forasmuch As thou mayest not behold the secrets shown To thy companion, sleep. When thou awakest, Thou shalt be with him and the ancient King. Percival. Nay, nay, I will not sleep. Merlin. Thou must. (To Taliesin.) For thee, Dear son, thou shalt not be as I. I am As I desired, but thy desire shall be Other, and thou shalt go from hence to win From brighter powers intenser wakefulness, While I sink back to deeper sleep. But first, Ere from the wood thou pass, thou shalt behold, Unclad alone to lyric eyes, the heart Of Broceliande, the Lady of the wood, The goddess of the silent stir of life, Nimue, in star-blinding nakedness. Percival. Thou wilt not do this thing. Taliesin. Thy dream for thee; But for me other stars and white desires. Great master, rest; and all thy will be thine. Merlin. I go again to the great deep. Farewell! [The form of Merlin fades away out of the circle of light. Nimue (to Percival). Wilt thou resist? Behold, if I stretch but my hand Like a gleam of the northlights against thee, thou yieldest. The calm Of the cool earth rises about thee, and over thy heart Shoots lacework of frost,—crystal lightnings that thicken and knit To a corselet of silence: Ice-bound, wilt thou strive, wilt thou wake? [Percival sleeps. Sleep; not for the eyes that contemn me, I draw from its sheath The white sword of my beauty. Sleep; ay, lest thou wake and it smite And cleave thee with madness. Taliesin. Goddess swift and fierce! I know the trail that in dim woods at eve Hangs like a mist and makes each stir of air Accord in music. I have caught and lost The memory of thy passing in thrilled skies, Or where waves crumble their thin edges down In laughter of shifting line. But never day So bugling, never night so druid-sweet That the elusive secret spoke itself, The lamp whose radiance or reflection washed The world in charm, blazed evident in pearl. Nimue. I have known thee, my lover, my bard. I have lurked in the leaves And allured thee with rumors, and fled, and beguiled thee to follow, Till I sank in the maze and escaped thee and laughed through my hair. Taliesin. Thou crafty, thou elusive, undivined! Laugh once again, O queen, with lyric throat And witchcraft of escape in wildwood eyes! —Nay, this time mock me not; though equal charm Abide in thee evasive in the glen Or in this arctic splendor palpable! Remain, remain; and from thy holy light, Oh, cast the pale electric mantle off; My eyes will dare the sun. Nimue. On thy head the event! Be thou weak to sustain the intolerable avatar, Thou shalt flee from this forest accursed; from this day at thy heart Like a vulture the rage of that beauty shall ravin for food And consume thee for failure to find it. But master thy soul And be strong to command in the blaze of the vision thy song, And my power shall be thine and the word of my magic to men. Achieve the ordeal, through me shalt thou seek other gods, And their light be upon thee. Taliesin. Reveal thyself. Nimue. See, at thy peril. [Nimue throws back from her shoulders her mantle, revealing herself in softer garments of a roseate yellow; these, with an almost imperceptible slowness, seem first to melt away into draperies of light, which vanish in turn save for shreds of luminous mist that linger a little and then disappear completely, leaving the goddess manifest in her beauty. All the while Taliesin, standing by the entranced body of his companion, sings to a strange accompaniment on his harp. Taliesin. As the stars dissolve in the dawn, Thou art warm, thou art fair; And the birth of thy beauty is gone Like a chord through the air. The darkness has heard, and is thrilled With a light to be born; The heart of the silence is filled With the trumpets of morn. As the kiss of two lovers at night Makes the darkness a choir, The dusk is a-quiver with light Of its heart's desire. Earth bows in her temple of stars In a rapturous hush, As beaconing over her scars God burns in the bush. As the heather glows over the hills Like a shadow ablaze, The moss of the forest-floor thrills Into bloom at thy gaze; The grasses begin to confer, And the crickets to fife; The borders of Death are astir With the armies of Life. Thou art comely, O queen, thou art strong As the red deer leaping; And the light of thy limbs is like song When thought lies sleeping; As the sphere of a star thou art fair; As an almond in bloom The flush of thy beauty laid bare Throbs, throbs in the gloom. O daughter and queller of strife, From whose beauty death slips Like a cloud in thy garments! my life For the cling of thy lips! I have known thee, our Lady of Birth; I have seen and adored; I must die on the reel of thy mirth Or be wholly thy lord. [He steps forward into the circle of light and kisses her. The light vanishes instantly, and the scene is plunged into darkness. SECOND MOVEMENT. The Slopes of Helicon. Nimue and Taliesin. Nimue. No further alone will the dream-mighty magic prevail Of the lightnings that lurk in my girdle. Do thou too put forth The flash of thy will and the jar of thy striving, and climb. Though I leave thee, I do not forsake thee. Taliesin. Nay, leave me not! Thy kiss throbs through me yet. My brain is like The beat of aching music, rhythmical, But groaning to be free. ... Oh, I grow faint! The glow in me, like moonlight seen through clouds, Pales! Nimue. They to whom I bear children, the birth-throes feel In spirit and brain, though I, the immortal, impassive, Suffer only, indwelling the dark of their being, in them. Lo, the earth is my womb, and the air is the door of my womb, And the domed sky is big with the births of my teeming. Be calm. [Floating in the air between the two appears a strange, elf-like Child. It is uncouth and hairy, and like a being of the woods, but there is yet a wild, unhuman charm in its look and smile. Taliesin. Mine! Mine! Dragon-fly darting Hither and thither,— Blue smoke of wings; Bee buzzing movelessly Over a blue-bell; Cloud in the sun, Clad with a gleam Glad as the clay-red Blaring of battle-horns! Mine, thou art mine! I demand thee! Child. I am a hedgehog; I am a burr; 'Ware prickles! Touch me not! Krr! krr! krr! Taliesin. Fairy or child; Elfin or human; Light on the tarn, Escaping the hollow hand, Scooped in the water, Eluding, alluring,— How shall I seize thee? Child. I'll dare you like a dare-dog; I'll haunt you like a witch; I'll lead you like a tanglefoot, And leave you in the ditch. Taliesin. Only one lure, Only one call for a lure! Hear! hear! Dark in the heart of the deep, Far in the speed of the stars,— Throb, throb,— Rune of the spheres! Child. Bells in the blue sky, Birds sing in June; I am a stickleback,— Tickle me with tune. Taliesin. Under the moss, Under the dream of the moss! Near, near! Dark in the sleep of the grass! Chime in the rumor of Time! Beat, beat,— Croon of the years! Child. Cricket in the grass cries; Bees buzz, buzz; I am a thistle-bloom,— Take me by the fuzz. Taliesin. Little ones know, Little ones know without knowing, (Dear, dear!) Dark in the guess of their hearts! Joy, my little one, joy! Leap, leap, To the tune of the world. [The Child settles in Taliesin's arms. Child. Grasshopper jumping In the early morning dew! Teach me how to dance so And I'll play with you. Enter above, at the top of a steep ascent, three Damsels, having their garments curiously embroidered, one with bells, another with precious stones and metals, the third with flowers. They come, dancing. The Damsels. Dance we merrily, maids of May! All the woods and the meadows laugh Low with crocus and hyacinth; Dance we lightly, the sky is blue! Light bells blown in the morning breeze, Hear them shimmering like fine rain Shot with sun to a lace of light Woven over the bosomed hills! Every flower with an opal gleams; All the grasses are tipped with joy; Wind in clover-bed, wind in fern, Kicks his heels with the mirth of morn. Decked for gala day, forth and free! Meet the morn with a heart of sky! Greet the wave with a rippled face, Dance we merrily, maids of May! Taliesin (playfully). Joy for my joy, and flowers for my flower! I'll have them, though I climb for 't. [Begins lightly to climb the slope. Nimue. Fare thee well! [Disappears. Child. Up we go, long legs, Up to the top! When we get there, will The blue sky drop? Damsels. Bring the boy to us. Look, this tree Silver-glittering with the morn,— We will make him as fair to see. [Taliesin and the Child reach the level, on which the three Damsels await them. Child. Pretty things, pretty things,— What can they be? Pretty toys, and pretty noise,— Give them all to me. Taliesin. That was an easy climb, and yet I hardly Can get my breath. You are not a light load, Youngster, for all you're but a morning old. First Damsel. Bells I bring, that your steps may chime! Second Damsel. Jewels, every eye to spell! Third Damsel. Flowers, to girdle you with sweet air! Child. Rings on her fingers, and bells on her toes, Garlands of daffodil, lily, and rose! She shall have music wherever she goes, And hands to hold up in a beautiful pose, And a very sweet smell in her nose,—her nose,— A very sweet smell in her nose! [A dance, in which the Child is passed from damsel to damsel, with a gay song; in the dance, they cover him with garments richly ornamented with bells, gems, and flowers. Damsels. Come, foot it with us gayly; Our legs are lithe as willow; Our heels are light as vapor! The sparkle on the water, When wind and sunshine frolic, No gayer than our glance is. The tinkle, tinkle, tinkle Of drops of water falling (A silver sound of laughing From lattices of morning), The flutter of blown grasses, The swing of twigs birds cling to, The pomp of poppied meadows, The revel of June roses, The reel of life made tipsy With vintages of laughter, Awake us, and we answer The call of day with music. And over blade and clover, As when the west wind passes, The grasses hardly bending, We twirl and glide and trip it Down wind-floors of desiring, To open doors of dreamland. [They dance away, leaving the Child covered with a profusion of ornaments. Child (still dancing). Oh, see the pretty spangles And hear the pretty jangles! From every corner dangles A garland to and fro! I love the silver tinkling, I love the starry twinkling, Although I've not an inkling Of what the garlands know. Taliesin. Beauty, but not the beauty of the soul I see dim-glowing like a coal the wind Fans till it kindles. Let the bells be bells, The roses breathe their rose-thought out in odors, The opal-passion through the opal sing; Thy loveliness is other. Come, away! Child. You sha'n't have my pretty things, I say. [Darting off. Taliesin. Nay, keep them, till you yield them of yourself. ... Higher to climb looks not so light a task As this first hillock. No ascent I see But up sheer heights and over rocky ways. But on the summit see I not afar Soft slopes and pleasant woods, and 'neath the boughs Calm goddesses whose moving, even here, Seems like a solemn music? ... I will climb! [Climbs up and out of sight with the Child. The scene changes to the summit of Helicon. The nine Muses are moving through an intricate and stately dance, in the intervals of which they sing. A simpler movement of the dance continues through the singing. The Muses. The supreme rays of the sun break into day, only on reaching At the far rim of the sphere, faint as the dim ghost of a dream-sea, The upwhirled foam of the thin air; In the void spaces between worlds it is night. So is the spirit Unrevealed, barren, remote, vain, but if made flesh for beholding; And its doom surely is darkness. For a soul speechless, without body, without token for comrades, Is the dark promise of soul only, enwombed still, unbegotten. But the flesh, giving the spirit To the world, gives it as well back to itself, great with a world's gain; And the word teaches our own thought that was spoke, teaching another; And the deed fashions the doer. To the unseeing, the unspeaking, the blue heaven is a vain thing And the world's hero a name. Love in his heart rots unaccomplished, As an oak dead in the acorn. But let speech fall like a sunburst on the night—lo, it unfolds star Upon star, height beyond height, world without end, till in its splendor It shall see God, it shall be God. Enter Taliesin and the Child. Taliesin. O benign goddesses, be gracious now To me who call upon you, ignorant, Unskilful, but my heart is set to sing. Urania. What gifts, then, dost thou bring, invoking goddesses? Taliesin. Joy, and a gift of praise, and sacrifice. Urania. Approach and offer these upon the altar, then. Taliesin. The sandals wherewith to this height I climbed, These for a pledge of years and weariness; The harp I play on, for a token of awe, Praise and the utter yield of all my song To your divine dominion, dames serene, Daughters of Wisdom; last of all, I give The song, the rapture of my heart, the love, The lyric joy, the child that made me glad. [He leaves the Child and the other gifts on the altar. O splendors of the eternal, hear my prayer! Teach me the knowledge of your ways, till what I feel in all my veins, I may declare In all my voices; what I know at heart, In speech incarnate; what my soul desires, Show forth in all the passion of my flesh. Divinities of light, oh, hear my cry! Urania. In the beginning is the Word; God, perfect Spirit, Eternally reveals himself. To Space he speaks And clothes himself in thunders of orchestral stars. He calls aloud, and Time grows rhythmic with the breath Of life. The grappling of the spheres declares the might Of his dominion, and their paths its perfectness. Lo, he hath builded the foundations of the world In night, and vaulted its blue dome with fire. His speech Is in the carved work of its walls, and where his hand Hath laid its floors in beauty. Very light of light, Behind the drench and dream of color lurks his love. Clio. Empires, migrations, battles, thrones, democracies, Wharves and adventuring sails, and clamor of fierce desires, Cities and priesthoods,—so the spirit of man is clay God moulds into the mighty image of his dream. Urania. The universe is his garment. Clio. And the soul of man His image, triune, sense and thought and love, full-sphered. Terpsichore. Last through the body, one with Man and Nature,—a speech Itself and mother of all speech else,—wherein the earth Takes on the likeness of divinity,—he shines. Taliesin. Ay, but the blind world sees not, till the artist Reverbs the messages. The myriad-wrought Harmonies of design and color fade For very intricacy of eloquence Into an indistinguishable gray. But bit by bit if disentangled, held Apart, and shown to men, their eyes, once seeing The broken beauty isolated, turn Back to God's work to find it there forever; So God makes use of poets. Teach me, then, To fashion worlds in little, making form, As God does, one with spirit,—be the priest Who makes God into bread to feed the world. Urania. The body is a form, with line and tone and tint And hue and texture, light and shade; and talks as clouds And mountains do, and oaks and grass and starry nights; And in its features what man is, is charactered. Nor may he change his nature but sure Time inscribes The record of the change upon that palimpsest. Terpsichore. Form is the subsidence upon the shores of Time Left there by motion of forgotten seas. Not form Alone, immutable and sterile diamond, The body is, but vibrant, pregnable, a harp Whereon the spirit plays innumerous melodies Of motion,—chords, progressions visible,—wherein Gather and fade the myriad unrecurring dreams, Passions and ecstasies that sweep like shadows o'er The prairies of man's heart. Polyhymnia. Nor this alone; without, An instrument whereon the harmonies of light And movement rise, within it is an organ wrought From crown to midriff for the wonder of tone. And so Man's life goes out in music. Terpsichore. Praise the body, then, A loveliness itself and twofold lyre to call New loveliness to being. Praise the blazon of flesh That like a clarion sunburst trumpets to the night The universe of soul: valley and peak and still Woodland and quiver of the universal air Leap from the silence, and the dead is made alive. Euterpe. Lute, viol, trumpet,—as a conquering king the soul O'ersteps the realm ancestral, fills dead Africas With colonies of music, multiplies its throne In empired harmonies. The forest yields its trees, The caverns of the earth their ores, and man creates A thousand throats to speak through. Oh, the wondrous frame The soul shall fashion for itself in that vast life God keeps for it in heaven! Speech of the yet unshaped, Dream of the yet enwombed and unborn in man's heart, He gropes for in the shudderings of the air. Erato. And last Man names the world, himself, and all that is therein, The incantation of the word calls from the dark The phantoms of the mind, insights, analogies, Conceptions, ratiocinations, memories,— Bodiless wizardries whose air-drawn lineaments Compel the ages. Calliope. Word, tone, gesture, color, shape, I sum them in the deed. Man, Master of an Act, At last and only finds whole utterance. Poet, sing The Hero, then, the man whose work the Lord of Worlds Confirms coeval with his peaks and stars. Melpomene. All speech Made one to voice the strife irreconcilable Of Will and Doom, of man and his relentless births Rending the spirit that engendered them, the war Of thunders in mid-air, battling if earth shall be Blasted, or filled with foison more divine,—for this Body and vesture, sound, speech, color, deed, inwrought In harmonies of harmonies! Thalia. All language, too, For joy, for reconcilement! God is a merry God; And from their lofty seats the laughter of the gods Goes up like crackling smoke of mighty forest fires. For mirth, the child, and reconciling love, a tall Young angel, and the calm of slow full-statured joy, These three stand nighest about the throne of God; and these Man utters and arouses when I come. Taliesin. I reel, Drunken with vision. Enter into me, Ye voices, and become my life, my soul! Or how shall I become what I discern? Terpsichore. Attend; and take the meaning of the signs you see. [A marvellous dance of the nine Muses. Terpsichore, approaching the altar, takes therefrom the Child, who, as he joins in the dance and repeats the beautiful, mysterious motions of the goddesses, is transformed from stage to stage of stature and loveliness, until he appears a youth, tall and slender and of perfect beauty. He is completely naked, all his ornaments having fallen from him in the dance. But the Muses gather up and restore to him a few, of such a nature that they enhance rather than cumber the lithe grace of his figure. The dance finished, the Youth turns to Taliesin. As he does so, Taliesin is aware that Nimue is again standing by his side; and with her the presence of two of the gods, which are Hermes and Apollo. The Youth. Below The city waits with garlands, and I go; The city waits with garlands like a bride. Now with the joy still in that look of hers, I must go to her. Not a sea-breath stirs Across the gardens where she waits and dreams Of one whose coming shall be like a tide Of day, flooding the marsh-long loops and gleams Of sunrise heavens in midsummertide. I am her lover; it is I she waits. Farewell; I go like summer to her gates. Hermes. Stay for a moment. If you go into the city With no more raiment than you need on Helicon, You'll hardly get the kind of welcome that you look for. Put on this mantle; it is the prevailing fashion, And has a magic virtue. All to whom you speak Will listen while you wear it. Should you strip it off, Beware! men stone the fool that jargons in their ears, ... And, since you seem to be in something of a hurry, Here, take my sandals (you observe the wings on them); Be off; you need winged sandals when a lady's waiting. Only, be sure, next time you are passing by Olympus, Leave them with Ganymede; I do not wish to lose them. [Apollo stretches forth his hands upon the Youth. Apollo. When thou wast still blown through the leaves at the will of the air, I was with thee! And when thou wert gathered in sleep in the womb of the dark, I was with thee! Look on me! Dost thou know me, who I am? The Youth. Brightness of God, bless me and set me free! [Apollo breathes upon his forehead, and the face and the whole body of the Youth send forth a glow as of flame seen through a veil. Taliesin. These be the gods, in truth. Nimue. And I, a god, Am with thee forever. Taliesin. I fear the gifts of gods. Nimue. The gifts of the gods are twofold,—death and life, Taliesin. Come death then, so they give me life indeed. The Youth. O World! O Life! O City by the Sea! Hushed is the hum Of streets; a pause is on the minstrelsy. I come, I come! The sunlight of thy gardens from afar Is in my heart. A girl's laugh dropt from heaven like a star Leads where thou art. The old men in the market-place confer, The streets are dumb; The sentinels await a harbinger— I come, I come! [He leaps downward through the air, and his song is heard dying in the distance. Taliesin kneels before Apollo, about whom the Muses gather. The Muses. O thou without whom song is a broken bell, Whose face is as white swords with the sun thereon! Look on thy priest who kneels before thee, Silent, awaiting the breath that quickens; As hangs a white ship under a tropic moon Between a windless sky and a waveless sea, Dream-still, with all sail set, till softly Over the waters a wind arises. Apollo. Give ear to their teaching, O thou who wouldst take fire and beacon with me! As wood or as brass they shall fashion thee; yea, as a lyre they shall frame Thy heart, and thy lips shall be moulded as the lips of a trumpet are wrought. They are cunning artificers; they are the makers of lutes for the gods. But, behold, I am he that shall smite into music the lutes they have strung; I am he that shall breathe through their trumpets; I am he that shall burn in their lyres. Ere thou lifted thy face for my seeking, ere thou wert, ere the world was, or these, The Nine of the secrets of wisdom, I was, and my song was, with God; And through me and the sound of my singing they were made, and all things that were made. The Muses. Before the worlds God was and the nothingness, The yawn of space; He spake, and the word was Thou, First-born of angels and archangels, Lord of the light and the lyre, Apollo. Thou art the breath God kindles the stars withal; The seed of God wherewith as a womb the world Conceives and brings forth life; the sea-cry Calling the soul to its ageless journey. Apollo. Greaten thyself to the end, I am he for whose breath thou art greatened; Perfect thy speech to a god's, I am he for whom speech is made perfect; And my voice in the hush of thy heart is the voice of the tides of the worlds. Thou shalt know it is I when I speak, as the foot knows the rock that it treads on, As the sea knows the moon, as the sap knows the place of the sun in the heavens, As the cloud knows the cloud it must meet and embrace with caresses of lightning. When thou hearest my voice, thou art one with the hurl of the stars through the void, One with the shout of the sea and the stampede of droves of the wind, One with the coursers of Time and the grip of God's hand on their harness; And the powers of the night and the grave shall avail not to stand in thy path. The Muses. Oh, well for him, strong son of the urge of song, Who, out of gloom dim-groping to find the sky, Beholds the splendor of our coming, Over the darkness a dawn arising; As when to lost wayfarers in woods at night Day breaks and spectres flee, and a bird begins His joy, and paths lie straight before them. So shall he stand with the sunlight on him, Beholding all things, myriad, evident, Each wave that lifts, each ripple upon the wave, And bird and bud and wind-borne drift-seed, Leaf and the vein in the leaf apparent. Till eye again grow dim with diviner sight, Till lips forget all craft in the lyric rush, Till knowledge be made one with being, Deep where the dark of the soul debates not. For he, with lips made swift for the song to pass. Shall be aware no longer of lips that sing; Use shall have made speech leap unbidden, Sure as a horse when he knows his rider. So day, that makes earth clear to its tiniest, But darkens heaven's orbed deeps and immensities; Marks motes and blots out spheres,—till night comes, Night with the stars and their revelations. THIRD MOVEMENT. The Chapel of the Graal. A Gothic hall of alabaster. In the middle, at back, steps lead up as to an altar; but in the stead of one are massive golden doors, bolted heavily. On the sides, the usual choir-stalls, in which the Choristers stand, singing their office. The aisle between is spacious, and in it, on the left, on a couch covered with white leopard skins, King Evelac, a man old beyond belief, with long white hair and beard, clad in white garments and crowned with a silver crown inwrought with diamonds, reclines as if sick and worn with long dolors. On the right, further back, Percival lies asleep, in the same posture as when the might of the sleep came upon him. His head and arm rest upon a couch covered with white leopard skins, and at his head Nimue stands, erect and clad in her electric mantle. Beside them Taliesin sits, with his harp. A blue light burns in the sanctuary-lamp. Neither King Evelac nor the Choristers pay any heed to the presence of the others; nor does the King at any time rise or change his posture. Choristers. Hidden in the hills of the soul, The dusk of us calls to thee— The lone of us cries to thee! Silent in the far of the soul, The desire of thee wakes to the dark. Who is he that comes like the day To reveal thou art nigh to us— To assure thou art touching us? Nay, for thou art gone with the day, Who wert nearer than touch in the dark. Utter thy desire, O my soul, In the still of the midnight— In the death of the midnight! Then shall there be signs for the soul And the whispers of God through the dark. King Evelac. As a stir in the air, when the aspens alone are aware— Choristers. We have heard thee, Beloved. King Evelac. As a voice in a dream, as an echo of voice in a dream— Choristers. We have heard thee, Beloved. King Evelac. As the birth of a rose, as the noise of an opening rose— Choristers. We have heard thee, Beloved. King Evelac. As the song of the spheres, as the cry of the lapse of the years— Choristers. We have heard thee, Beloved. King Evelac. As a cloud in the sky, that dissolves ere it catches the eye— Choristers. We have seen thee, Beloved. King Evelac. As the light in a face, that a moment sufficed to efface— Choristers. We have seen thee, Beloved. King Evelac. As the breath of the moon in the lull of a midnight in June— Choristers. We have seen thee, Beloved. King Evelac. As the vision supreme, when the prayer dies away in the dream— Choristers. We have seen thee, Beloved. King Evelac. As the fingers that pass in the stir of the wind in the grass— Choristers. We have touched thee, Beloved. King Evelac. As a bird feels the air in its wings, to caress and upbear— Choristers. We have touched thee, Beloved. King Evelac. As the breath of a lover is warm on the cheek of his love— Choristers. We have touched thee, Beloved. King Evelac. As the feel of the night and its spaces, about and above— Choristers. We have touched thee, Beloved. King Evelac. By the cry of the heart in the darkness, to know where thou art— Choristers. We beseech thee to hear us. King Evelac. By the grace thou hast shown, by the tokens and touch we have known— Choristers. We beseech thee to hear us. King Evelac. By the vigil thou keepest about us, awake and asleep— Choristers. We beseech thee to hear us. King Evelac. By thy coming at night, by the voice and the kiss and the light— Choristers. We beseech thee to hear us. ... King Evelac. Listen to the fearfulness of our love. Choristers. And forgive us the unloveliness that we have wrought. ... King Evelac. Alas, the memory of our trespass clings Bat-like and sucks the courage of our hearts. Alas, the knowledge of our faithlessness Clings like an ivy to our crumbled pride. Choristers. Forgive us, Beloved. King Evelac. Nathless, thou hast not wholly cast us off. Nathless, we are the wardens of the light We may not see, the love we dare not touch. Oh, may the time be shortened that we watch! Choristers. Forgive us, Beloved. ... King Evelac. Therefore we have shaken off fear from our feet and shame from our eyelids. Choristers. And our song is a song of love, and our voice is a voice of rejoicing. ... King Evelac. As a poet abashed at the heights on him flashed from above— Choristers. We adore thee, O Lord. King Evelac. As a dog lifts his pitiful eyes to his master for love— Choristers. We adore thee, O Lord. King Evelac. As a child's heart breaks in the dark for its mother with love— Choristers. We adore thee, O Lord. King Evelac. As a maiden's soul is a moonlit marsh with love— Choristers. We adore thee, O Lord. King Evelac. O secret, O sweet, O piercing Lord of the soul! ... Choristers. Lover in the silent night Who comest like still peaks Under the lonely stars Into the soul's retreats! O lover like unto the light Of a dawn seen under the sea! As a leaf that the loam debars, Our desire is unto thee. As sea-floors trampled with wind, We are under thy feet; And the light of thy coming is dimmed With the daze of its sweet; We are spread as a plain for thy couch, And the grasses are deep; Kiss us with the kisses of thy mouth, Which are sweeter than sleep. Lord of the lone heights Where the soul has fear! Lord of the secret nights Of the starlit mere! We are the waves that hush For the light to be. Dawn o'er us, ravish us, Prone unto thee. ... [A long pause, in which the Choristers remain with their faces raised in silent adoration. Then, rising, they leave the stalls silently and, meeting in the centre, before the golden doors, kneel two by two; turning, they come down the spacious aisle and, pausing two by two to bow before the ancient King, go out in silence by a little door on the right. During the singing of the office, Percival has awaked. Percival. There is a quiet thrill along the air, As if God laid his hand upon the place. How came we hither? Whither have we come? Taliesin. We came through many lands, across a sea, And into a white summer. When I first Looked on it, tales of Thule and Ysmonde Woke in my soul, and lands of ice and snow. But from the fields a breath of lilied June Blessed me upon the eyelids with a kiss. No glitter of the diamonds of the snow Was on the fields, but lilies and white grass, Softer than ermine, lush and thick and deep, Wherein no footfall sounded. Tall white trees Blossomed with pale mists of blue flowers; and birds With plumage like the green of sunset skies, Or the dim violet of the moon's dark orb When the first silver rims it, sprang from bough To bough and sang as birds sing in a dream Of argent heavens. Aloof, against white cliffs The blue sea lay in calm, silent and smooth, Under the cloudless sky. And all the place Was dim as the great deeps of a man's soul Or of the sea. And in the midst of all Lay a white temple, with a golden light That issued from its roof and reached the sky Like a strange sunrise coming from the north. Therein we entered. Percival. Knowest thou naught else? (To Nimue.) ... Unknown and mighty, who hast brought me here, Tell me, thou! Is it the Chapel of the Graal? [Nimue vanishes softly as he speaks, but a vague wraith of her is still, from time to time, seen dimly in the shadows. (To Evelac.) ... King, for thou seemest like a king and bearest Upon thy brow the closed crown of a king; Priest, for thou doest the office of a priest And wearest alb and stole—I kneel to thee, Unwitting who thou art. Wisdom and eld Are in thy face, at least, and kindliness. I pray thee, tell me whither I am come. King Evelac. Since I came into the white land, the slow Waters that eat an inch a year, have gnawed The length of six graves inland from the cliffs. Here without change of spring or winter, I, Changeless as the still season, wait. My name Is Evelac, of whom perchance some bruit Sighs still along the arches of the world. I was a king, what time one of the Three Who are in One forever, shrank his skies Into the compass of a maiden's womb. After He tore the mask from rosy Death, Arimathean Joseph came to me In the wild North I reigned in, preaching peace, Bearing in his hands a marvel, even— Percival. The Graal! King Evelac. The Cup of Mystery, men call the Graal: Thou seekest it? Beware! On me, the first, The sacred madness of the Vessel came. Too rash, I would have stretched my hand upon it When Joseph died; the wound thereof I bear. Yet,—for my love was great,—this grace is mine, That God shall choose the issue of my flesh To lift the Graal up like a vasty torch Blazing God's beacon in the gulfs of sky; And till he come, the ninth from me in birth, I, seeing not, unworthy to draw nigh, Barred from its beauty and its gloriousness, Keep watch before yon portals of its shrine, Doing due ritual, warding it from ill, The porter of the mysteries of God. The centuries go by like northern lights; But I remain till all this be fulfilled, And he whom God has chosen, come at last To heal me of my wound, and gain the Graal. Percival. Not overbold, nor without heavenly signs, Have I come hither. King Evelac. Art thou he I wait? Come near, my son, that I may look on thee. ... Seven kings have ruled the realm I left to them, Eldest from eldest born, of my descent, The last of whom was Ban. From him should spring A son, his first-born, whom all men shall praise; And from that son he that shall gain the Graal. ... Percival. The first-born of King Ban all men indeed Praise, and acknowledge knight without a peer; All men, from Arthur to a villager, Praise Launcelot du Lac, the son of Ban. King Evelac. And art thou, then, his son? Percival. No son of his Breathes the sweet air that blows across the world. Bound by a sterile love of lips denied, Too fervent-faithful to that love to woo Another, he will never have a son. King Evelac. God shall accomplish his decrees, though chance, Folly, and the weak wills of men withstand them. Man's disobedience shall fulfil his hests As well as man's submission. Deem not thou The oracles of God are empty words. ... And as for thee, since thou art not the son I wait, give o'er; the Graal is not for thee. Percival. Thy oracles for thee, and mine for me. I have no other lantern for my feet Than the one given into my hand. The lights That others bear, however true for them, But cast conflicting gleams athwart my path And dazzle all my searching. Such high warrant I have for my desire, I must obey, Were Death, not Life, the Lord behind the door. ... [He takes three steps toward the golden doors and stops suddenly, as if arrested by an invisible hand. The bolts glide back of themselves, noiselessly, and the doors open. The soft, intense splendor of the Graal fills all the place, but the Graal is not seen; for seven Angels, all in gold, stand before it, which are the Seven that see God continually. One of them, Uriel, who stands in the middle, a little before the others, holds in his hands a flaming sword. Uriel. Percival ... Percival! ... Approach no nearer thy desire, thou of the Choice. The time is not yet. Still the air thy spirit breathes too thickened is with noise Of earth-blown rumors for the thin pulsations of the interstellar voice To stir its sluggard atoms to the unbroken theme the deeps hear and rejoice. Thy heart is yet too full of anger, and the hate of evil clots thy soul; Too far from hell to hate it must he be whom God shall breathe on as a coal Until the pure light of perfection burns about him like an aureole. Pray to the tranquil night to let the calm of stars beneath the silent pole Fall like a mighty hand upon thy spirit, even like the hand of Death. And in that hour when thou art clothed upon with the tranquillity of Death, When Love has cast out even the hate of hate,—Love whom the gods name Death,— Come, and the gates shall open; come, and thou shalt enter in the holy place, See the mask melt into the features of the Living Soul it covers, face The Eyes that all love looks through, feel intense about thee like a burning breath The swift invasion of his heart-beats, the reverberation of his grace. ... Taliesin. Lord, who am I that I should let my voice Swim like a mote into the golden silence That pours like sunlight from thy ended speech? ... Tall lord of splendors, slay me not with light, If I, unworthier than a grasshopper, Send my thin cry across the summer noon! ... Yet will I take heart, O my lord, and speak; For thou it was, none other, albeit now In fiercer light and shape more awful shown, That on the Mount of Vision spake to me And showed me many signs and breathed upon me, Filling my spirit with the pulse of Time. Under thy forms I know thee for the same; And by the touch still tingling on my brow Dare speak a child's speech at my father's feet. Behold the man that kneels before thee here, Whom thou dost not arraign of any sin. Much has he wrought and suffered much, to come Unto this place. Shall he be sent away With no more grace than this thou givest him? Uriel. Better the rose of love out of the dung-hill of the world's adulteries Than the maid icicle that keeps itself from stain of earth where no life is In the aloof of splendors boreal. His own soul bars him from God's bliss, Dwindling the sun to its own sterile sheen and freezing with transparencies. Let him go back among his fellow-men and learn to love and learn to give, Forgetting the white beauty of his soul in the desire that all that live Should beacon into beauty. ... Yet a sign to star the dark he shall receive, Because another pleads for him. Such power have prayers of self oblivious. Let him await Another who shall come, and sit in the Siege Perilous, And live. In him he shall behold how light can look on darkness and forgive, How love can walk in the mire and take no stain therefrom. In him he shall possess The stainlessness he craves, outside himself; and in that vision luminous Letting his chiselled virtue melt, reflect at last God's loving holiness. ... Taliesin. My thoughts are vain thoughts, and my words are folly; Yet I have spoken and thou hast not frowned, Yet I have cried and thou hast looked on me. Therefore will I gird my heart up once again And speak out boldly to the Lord my God. Thou who beholdest God continually, Doth not his light shine even on the blind Who feel the flood they lack the sense to see? The lark that seeks him in the summer sky Finds there the great blue mirror of his soul; Winged with the dumb need of he knows not what, He finds the mute speech of he knows not whom. Is not the wide air, after the cocoon, As much God as the moth-soul can receive? Doth not God give the child within the womb Some guess to set him groping for the world, Some blurred reflection answering his desire? We, shut in this blue womb of doming sky, Guess and grope dimly for the vast of God, And, eyeless, through some vague, less perfect sense Strive for a sign of what it is to see. The gardens that we journey for are hid Behind the curve of the eternal sphere; Yet sometimes in the sky there is a light As of a thousand pearls, that is of them. This man has reached the little-travelled roads; Grant him some vision of the nearing goal. Uriel. Draw nearer, thou! For unto thee shall be declared the word of him that is. Less perfect in the circle of thy powers than he thou pleadest for in his, Thou hast a sense he lacks, a sense still clouded over with impurities But dim-discerning the eidolons that arise from that which is not seen. Kneel; for before thy time the Lord shall lead thy feet into the Ways Serene, Into the meadows of his smile, the riverlands that look upon his mien; Before thy time thy soul shall bathe in the still pools in which his Face is seen. [He lifts a sphere of diamond above his head. Draw near and look within the crystal orb I lift above thee for a sign. The glory hidden from thee by our golden wings upon that sphere a-shine Leaves there the vision lurking for the eyes that see. Deem not the grace is thine Of thine own merit. Much is given unto thee, that much by thee be given. Thou art the eye for him thou comest with, that he may know the joy divine; Thou art an eye for all thy kind, to lead them to the open gates of heaven. ... [Taliesin slowly draws nearer the Angel and kneels on the lowest step beneath his feet, looking up fearfully into the diamond sphere. The Angels. Thine! Thine! Thine! Thine! Thine! O kindle of the world! O Love divine! O wonder of the uncomprehended Sign Wherein the darks of thee take fire and shine, Blazing on earth what heaven could scarce divine! Thine! .. Prone Before the awful night of thine unknown, Tides that set blind from zone of space to zone, We lift ourselves in glowing peaks to throne The Dawn eternal where thy Face is shown, Known, known! Dim of Time! Within the waters, lo, the lights that rhyme The timeless splendors of the heights sublime! Calmer and calmer till the under-grime Dies in the vision of the holier clime Above thy billows, Time. Near! near! near! near! near! Until beneath the film of sheen, O seer, Thine eyes behold the incarnation clear, The skies within the dewdrop of the sphere, Gleams of the heavens on heavens that appear, Sheer. ...! Taliesin. Oh, Heart of the Silences! Cheek nestling close to my cheek! Breathing in the dark! Cooing of doves in my soul! Whisper of death in the cool! Thy coming is like a pool of still water; The leaves of the poplars are not stirred. Thy coming is like a meadow at sunset; The haystacks cast no shadows; A spell has arrested the world. God hath not considered my unworthiness; And my ill favor he hath set at naught. He hath stretched out his arms to me, as a lover, And solicited me from afar. I am terrified with thy loveliness, O God. Thy joy is like the joy of the Night! Night of dim bugles! Night of the horns of dream! Night of the listening soul! Orchestral Night! Night of flute-silver rivers and the chanting hills! Night of the silent music of the moon! My soul lies in the lull of thy spirit Like a lote on a lonely lake; My soul melts like snow in the waters of thy joy; Thy love is like a white silence; The joy of death is in my soul. [Taking his harp, he sings: Unaware as the air of the light that fills full all its girth, Yet crowds not an atom of air from its place to make way; Growing from splendor to splendor, from birth to birth, As day to the rose of dawn from the earlier gray; As day from the sunrise gold to the luminous mirth Of morning, and brighter and brighter, till noon shall be; Intense as the cling of the sun to the lips of the earth, And cool as the call of a wind on the still of the sea, Joy, joy, joy in the height and the deep; Joy like the joy of a leaf that unfolds to the sun; Joy like the joy of a child in the borders of sleep; Joy like the joy of a multitude thrilled into one; Under the teeth that clench and the eyes that weep, Deeper than discord or doubt or desire or wrong, One with the wills that sow and the Fates that reap, Joy in the heart of the world like a peal of song. Stir in the dark of the stars unborn that desire Only the thrill of a wild, dumb force set free, Yearn of the burning heart of the world on fire For life and birth and battle and wind and sea, Groping of life after love till the spirit aspire, Into Divinity ever transmuting the clod, Higher and higher and higher and higher and higher Out of the Nothingness world without end into God. Man from the blindness attaining the succor of sight, God from his glory descends to the shape we can see; Life, like a moon, is a radiant pearl in the night Thrilled with his beauty to beacon o'er forest and sea; Life like a sacrifice laid on the altar, delight Kindles as flame from the air to be fire at its core! Joy, joy, joy in the deep and the height! Joy in the holiest, joy evermore, evermore! The Angels. Thine! Thine! Shrined in the worlds of worlds, whom yet the shrine Of the domed universe doth not confine! Red in the chalice of the years like wine! Uttered, unutterable, awful, and benign! Thine! Thine! Thine! Thine! Thine! ... Thine! ... Thine! ... Thine! ... Thine! ... [The golden doors close silently, and the song of the Angels dies away within. V.

Is there no charm to overturn his state? No magic net to cast about his legs And trip him in his triumph? Where's that skill For which the ignorant people call you witch And even the learned, seeing the strange control With which you make the laws of things o'ercome And contradict themselves, call by your name The emancipated worlds that hang in the clouds, Fata Morgana—where's the use of witchcraft When Arthur lives and waxes? Oh, for some horror To strike him helpless, paralyzed, aghast, With doom advancing on him! Why, he grows Too great for this small world, and his vast stride Will shortly plant one foot out on the moon And straddle space for empire. The old heroes Are clean forgot, and every piping poet Must squeak of Arthur, where the antique bards Sang the divine deeds of the sons of gods. Morgana. What share have we in it? We are his sisters, Or else he is no king. Where, then, our part I' the pageant and the power? Morgause. He knows well We are no sisters to him. He is a changeling, A base-born upstart, an abandoned bastard— Who knows save Merlin?—Merlin's son, perhaps, And grandson to the Devil. Morgana. He has scorned us. You know that once I stole Excalibur, The sword and scabbard, and for proxy left A false and brittle weapon by his bed, Where he slept heavily beneath my spell; And that Sir Accolon took the great sword And fought with him, and yet the King o'ercame, Though weak with wounds and well-nigh weaponless. He slew Sir Accolon— Morgause. Alas, my sister! Morgana. Tut, can a dead man longer give us joy? He slew Sir Accolon, but slew not me, Who was his worser foe. You knew all this, But knew not that I sought his couch again Where, seeing the sword clutched in his sleeping hand, I durst not touch it; but the sheath I took And cast it in the pool. Morgause. And to what end? Men fight not with their sheaths. Morgana. There spoke the unlearned. Not by the forthright and the obvious way Is knowledge won or power. Upon this sheath There is a prophecy that his fortunes hang And on its loss the loss of all his weal. Morgause. And you believe this? Morgana. I have studied long In learning fearsome to the general, And marvels have become my commonplaces, And now I prophesy that from this hour The flood of Arthur's destiny stands still And lapses to its ebb. Morgause. Look yonder! Look! A rider in the road!—a knight!—Ah me, If it were Lamoracke! Morgana. Give heed to me. You were not wont to be a lovesick girl In your amours. I go to Camelot, Where I would have your son, Sir Mordred, come— Morgause. Mordred, my son? Morgana. You shudder at his name. Morgause. He and his name alike are dreadful to me. Morgana. Your son, Sir Mordred, whom you bore to Arthur, Before you found him so unlovable. Morgause. What said he then of brother or of sister? An idle tale to help him to the throne, For which he spat on me!—The knight draws near.— Hell were too brief to give my outrage ease!— 'Tis he! 'Tis Lamoracke. Morgana. Now out upon you For a weak fool! Is this to wreak revenge? I come to show the way. Send Mordred to me Disguised, for Arthur cannot bear his face. It is as sure as there is truth in hell That he shall kill the King. My nightly devil— Morgause. He is at the drawbridge. See, he enters in! —Oh, Mordred shall be told. His hate no more Than mine needs your exciting. I have lived So long with hate it hath become unconscious; Nor would I think of it,—it has grown tiresome,— And I would have some joy before I die. Love is more novel. Oh, I shall remember! [Enter Lamoracke.] O Lamoracke! Morgana. Nay, farewell then! I'll not stay To listen love-songs. Lamoracke. Not so fast, fair lady, For I have news to make you gasp with wonder. Morgause. No tenderer greeting! Do you fear my sister? I do not say that she's not dangerous; But since when have we loved like timid wives And startled cavaliers that meet by stealth And dare not fling their deeds in the world's face And scoff at scandal? Would all Camelot Knew with what scorn their coward decencies And creeds that have no birth behind the lips— Why, what's the matter, sir? Lamoracke. Though all my soul Cry out to reach you, I may not advance. I have sworn a vow. Morgana. This is most strange. Morgause. A vow! Lamoracke. 'Tis but three days ago I left you. Well, Three days will serve as well as thirty years To make the world all over. I have seen It is another kind of world than that I thought it. I accept what I have seen. Morgana. More mysteries! Your news, sir. Lamoracke. Yesterday There came a young lad to the Court,—by heaven, A beardless boy, as frail as some slim girl With pale thin face and sad unheeding eyes That men remember when they have passed by. This child—what think you that he came to seek? Knighthood—the heavy arms of strong men and The stress of errantry. By God, no less! Then came Sir Launcelot and called him son And knighted him; and in the joust that day He did unhorse me, me whose name men speak With Launcelot's and Tristram's. This he did, This stripling, Galahad, Sir Launcelot's son. Morgana. What, has the faithful Launcelot proved untrue? Lamoracke. No man dare say that Launcelot e'er was false To Guenevere. This is the tale they tell. Elaine, the daughter of King Pelleas, Loved him, and knowing him too true to see In all the world but one fair woman's love, Got her old nurse, Dame Brisen, with enchantments To clothe her in the likeness of the Queen. Then came she in to Launcelot and he, Unwitting was deceived; and in this wise Was Galahad engendered. Morgause. Come, your vow! Morgana. This is the tale he told to Guenevere; How easily men think us to be gulled. Morgause. What care I for this boy? There's more behind. Lamoracke. The selfsame night, the jousting being done, And the King being absent with Sir Galahault, Sir Kaye and others on affairs of state, We sat us down to feast; whereat this boy, This Galahad, being new-come to our board, Cast but a glance about the great Round Table, And with the sudden sureness of a shaft Gained his quick-chosen seat,—a throne wherein Not the great King himself e'er dared to rest, And Merlin called it the Siege Perilous. For it was written that no man might sit Within that seat, save one it waited for, But he should die. Therein the boy sat down And died not, but his face seemed glorified, And a great marveling went about the hall. Morgana. So had it been with you, had you sat there, Or any other knight. Now it is strange How men will dread their own imaginings. Lamoracke. There as we sat, expectant of strange things, A sudden storm arose, and the quick lightnings Made pale and lurid in recurrent change The torches of our feast; and each man spoke Hoarse or in whispers or with measured voice As each one felt in his own way the awe That calms the air before prodigious births. What happened then I cannot well report, For I was all confused; but Percival My brother saith it was the Holy Graal That passed before our eyes, the very Cup Wherein Our Lord first shed his mystic Blood, Brought by the saint from Palestine and shrined At Glastonbury many centuries. Long since it vanished and it now returns To bring the golden ages back to us. I saw it not but saw its radiance And felt its power. So, silent for a space We stood, till Gawaine broke the hush and swore An oath that for a twelvemonth and a day No lust of body nor no lust of praise Nor aught that chains us to this middle-earth Should intercept him but he should attain This quest. And all we swore it after him. Morgana. Virgins! Ha! Ha! The Knights of Camelot Sworn virgins for a year! Lamoracke. It is our oath. Morgana. Then I may safely leave you with my sister. Farewell, sir. I'm in haste for Camelot Where lords are welcome more than ladies now. Sister, forget not to send on a man. Farewell! La! virgins! [Exit laughing.] Morgause. Lamoracke! Lamoracke. Morgause! I could not leave—I could not go away Upon so far—so vague—I know not what— Without a last farewell. Morgause. So far? Would you be further If you in truth had found the Holy Graal On the other side of Nowhere? Lamoracke. I have sworn. Morgause. Sworn what? Sworn infidelity? Sworn hate? Then why are you come here? O Lamoracke! Say it is false, say that my ears have lied, You said it not, you swore no vow. Kiss me And say it is not true. Lamoracke. It is the truth. Morgause. Why should you take a quest like this upon you? You are no visionary. Lamoracke. The rest swore and I swore. Morgause. How little we are to you? Why, a woman— And you betray us for a summer dream. Lamoracke. Look you, I have no great faith in this quest. Such things may be for Galahad—not for me. But I have undertaken it. Stand not you Between me and the trial. I have come Straining a bond which yet I will not break For parting and not pleasure. Let us part. Morgause. Since it must be, then, and the love you swore Is all so weak, since all our joy must pass And that sweet season when life san for us With lips that half forgot old cruelties, —Do you remember when you kissed me first? Ah, I remember, for the sun seemed then To burst the black clouds that o'erroofed my life, And all the quivering color of the day And happy voices of all living things Began then. Ah, how wicked I had been— How joyless you will never know. You saved me —Love saved me, love reconciles all ill— But let that pass. Since all this now is done, One boon, for dead love's sake, ere love be dead. Lamoracke. So that it be not to forego the quest, Anything! Morgause. One last night of joy. Lamoracke. Of joy? Morgause. Nay, start not, nothing that your vow forbids. One night of revelry in innocence As in the old days when you found me here And cheered my desolation ere we loved As we have loved. Lamoracke. So be it. Morgause. Lionors! [Sings] O merry when the owlet calls Across the moonlit snow! And merry in the Devil's halls Where such as we must go Lionors! [Enter Lionors.] Quick, uncorslet the good knight— Or stay, no hands but mine shall do that office. Be ready with a bowl to lave his hands In orient perfumes—and fetch in a mantle Of softest sarsnet, rich in broideries. [Exit Lionors] [Sings as she undoes his armor.] It was a Knight and a fair Lady— Sing, all the winds are still! She took the helmet from his head And oh but her cheeks were rosy-red— And hark, the partridge over the hill! [Re-enter Lionors with mantle, and Attendant with bowl, etc.] It was a Knight and a fair Lady— Sing, all the winds are stirring! She loved him more than love can tell, But he left her soul to the hounds of hell— A soul or a bird, in the wind went whirring? [Exeunt Lionors and Attendant.] [The context of this song of Morgause is among the lost material.] O I've come back to hell, My Dears, O I've come back to hell. The bliss of the saints is long complaints, So I've come back to hell. O I've come back to hell, My Dears, O I've come back to hell. Love's joy is sweet but bitter fleet, So I've come back to hell. O I've come back to hell, My Dears, O I've come back to hell. Love's joy being done what better fun Than back to the joys of hell. SCENE II. —A Courtyard. Fountain playing, flowers, etc. Pander and Porter on a bench, throwing dice. Pander. The devil's in the dice. I'll play no more to-day. God be praised, trade was never more brisk, and we have the finest pieces of women's flesh in fifty leagues. Else your cursed luck had drained me as dry as a worm-eaten walnut. Porter. Fortune's a balky filly; you must ride hard while she is in mood to carry you. [Knocking.] Pander. More gallants! Well, I see Venus isn't ungodessed yet. [Exit Porter.] He that would get gold, let him sell the necessities of life. [Enter Percival and Galahad.] Good evening, gentlemen, and a merry night to you. I'll go call the ladies. [Exit Pander.] Percival. That's an odd varlet. Galahad. Ay? I did not mark him. Percival. I liked him not. This is a pleasant place. Galahad. How beautiful are lilies! See them raise Their crowned heads like royalties above Their lowlier fellows. There's no king on earth So simply all-sufficient to his life As these. There is a touch of God in them. Percival. It is the glory of man that he must strive. Galahad. That he may reach their rounded life at last. Percival. No more than these? Galahad. Ay, more than these, no doubt, But filling out his vaster orb of life And love and contemplation with the same Serene completeness and untroubled poise, Not fretful, not unsatisfied, not eager, But calm, great, un ... Like lilies in the garden of the Lord. [Enter Sendal and Guimere.] Guimere. ... SCENE III. —Camelot. Hall of the Palace. Dubric and Launcelot. Dubric. Now God be praised that thou, Sir Launcelot, Art wrought to this resolve. One act of thine Outsermons my whole Lent,—so much art thou The secret heart of every Knight-at-arms Made manifest, his pattern and desire. For what thou hast revealed, I have entombed it. Even had confession no safeguarding oath, Yet were my love for thee, my son, too great And my desire to help thee to an end So nobly vowed, too keen—Be not afraid; This sleeps, for me, until the great awakening At the Last Day. Launcelot. My sin has rent my heart; I have seen day by day unworthy loves Taking in vain the name of that which was, So help me Christ, howe'er an act of sin, In both our hearts a holy mystery. I have seen myself, unworthy that I am, Chosen of men a captain and exemplar, And by the same lips that exalted me Debased with attribution of vile thought Until the holiest secrets of my heart Showed shameful and malign, and so deformed Became a scripture for the vulgar spirit To justify its filth with. So I saw That that which was the cause of sin in others, Howe'er itself immaculate at heart, Must be by circumstance made interdict. Dubric. Man cannot live unto himself alone, But every deed returns upon the doer A thousandfold. What he hath done to one, He doth admit that all may do to him, And who shall say how many will accept The gage? Launcelot. I had a quarrel with the world; It had done me wrong; therefore I put it by And took my own, or so I thought. But now, Even to take my own, I would not do This evil to my fellows. Dubric. Ay, well said; And yet do not too much forget, my son, That howsoe'er your heart betray your conscience, Confusing good and ill, it was a sin, Essentially a sin, for coveting Gives no true title, though it lead to theft. Self masques so oft as conscience there's no safety Save in submitting conscience, self and all, To her who only can distinguish them Unerringly, the Church. To her hath God Committed this, and what she binds on earth Is bound in heaven, and what she looses here Is loosed there also. Launcelot. I would in all things Submit myself to Holy Church as unto God visible and audible on earth. Therefore, resigning all pretence to judge, I have committed to the Church and God The argument of sin, content myself To execute their warrants. And now, absolved, I leave the past and with a single heart Devote myself to this most holy quest, Whereof the vision and the miracle Vouchsafed us in the coming of the Graal Is as the rainbow covenanting hope; And to what service else the Church may will. Dubric. God's blessing be an Eastern star to thee And lead thee to His peace. [Enter Galahault and Bors.] Galahault. Old friend, what's this? Launcelot. Welcome to Camelot! Galahault. Sir Bors hath told me A tale so strange I scarce can credit it. Go you upon this quest? Launcelot. Ay, if so be In any way I may renew good deeds. Galahault. Or any way employ your soul. I see You too have known at last life's weariness. Ah well, pray God you find a better cure Than I! Launcelot. Will you not come with me, my friend? Galahault. Not I; I am too far gone in weariness. I have not faith enough to serve a flea To jump from dog to dog. Besides, you leave The King alone; scarce one of his great knights But goes upon the quest. Needs must that some Remain nor leave him all disretinued. Launcelot. Mayhap your service will be more than ours; But I am hushed with hope. What tidings, Bors? Is all made ready for our setting forth? Bors. Our steeds stand saddled at the palace gates, Yours, Galahad's, Percival's and my own. Launcelot. And where Is Galahad? Bors. With Percival. They are Inseparable as doves. Even such a pair Meseemeth you and I in the old days Dreamed and aspired together. Twenty years Sink out of time, and over the long gap My soul leaps back to boyhood when I see them, And my eyes fill with tears. Launcelot. God grant that they Make good our failures! Though I lose all else, I am most happy that I have my son, My Galahad, in whose more perfect life I shall not be left all unjustified. [Enter Dagonet, with a lantern.] Galahault. What do you with the lantern, Fool? Dagonet. I am a philosopher hunting mice. When the wise men all turn fools, it is time for the fool to turn wise man. And, in truth, I think my search will bring me to a bottle before theirs will them to a cup. Dubric. Let not your folly grow blasphemous. Dagonet. Nay, the King will not let my tongue be slit; he is too poor in advisers. The whole Court is Graal-mad, and Sir Galahault and I are all that is left of the Privy Council. Galahault. Even so, fellow-counsellor. Where left you the King? Dagonet. At his wit's end. Galahault. No; but whereabouts? Dagonet. Beside himself. Galahault. But in what place? Dagonet. In a tight one; for his knights leave him to chase fireflies, while all the lamps of the kingdom are left untrimmed—all save the Fool's lantern, and that serves but to show empty benches. But, in good sooth, the King is coming hitherward quite outcaptained and helpless even to show his own vexation. [Enter Arthur, Kaye and others; Percival and Taliesin.] Arthur. Is it true, Launcelot? Was there no thought of me or my great dream To build the perfect State (whereto ye all Were bound with a great oath)—did naught of this Speak for me in your heart? Heaven may be served In many ways. I trust I serve no less, Who would extend God's justice and knit close The solid race, than they that seek new ways To bring the grace of heaven into our hearts. Even to do good, will you forsake that good Whereto your hands are set? Launcelot. My lord, believe me, I serve you best in this. Arthur. Nay, go thy way. Thou art the noblest man my swarming life Has yet been fronted with. What thou doest Must have some glory in it; nor would I Have anyone for me break sacred vows, Though they were madness. Yet I must bewail That which deprives my kingdom of thy sword, My heart of thy great spirit. God be with thee! ACT III. SCENE II Arthur. O Guenevere, you have made me the happiest man To-night in all my kingdoms. I have craved Long years, and have not spoken. I have held Your selfhood far more royal than my crown And your soul's privacy more sacred from Irreverent entrance than the sanctuary. Your husband, I have held your loveliness Exempt; your King, I ne'er profaned your will. Guenevere. O sir, you have been royal. Arthur. Nay, I think That I have been but just. There's nought so dear To man or woman as that crag of life Where each walks lonely. There's no bond on earth, Nor wedlock nor the sacred rule of kings, So strong that it may overbear this right Of each soul to itself. The holy place Of the heart's temple no man lawfully May enter, save he bear the high election Of priest to the divinity within. You have withheld from me; it was your right And I have not complained. But now that you Have razed the wall you chose should be between us, I am more laureled and victorious Than with ten empires or a thousand battles. Ay, though the flower of my fair knights be lost, Following a quest that few or none may gain, Even Launcelot, my greatest—why, I have made A fellowship that fifty knights were lost in. And when our children take our place and theirs— Guenevere. Children! Arthur. Ay, sweetheart, when the throne of Britain Shall have an heir to keep what we have won, There'll not be fagots in the wood enough To feed the bonfires. Guenevere, you have done A deed to-night that sets a star i' the brow Of womanhood, and rounds my dream of empire To its proportioned close. I will not seize My new-found joy too violently, to make Your bounty, like the first buds of the spring Met by a blast of March, shrink back again And shrivel in the bark. Good night, sweet Queen, And God be with us and our house! [Exit.] Guenevere. Children? To bear him children! No, God strike me dead! CURTAIN. NOTES ON THE HOLY GRAAL. At first thought the association of the words “Holy Graal” with scenes of evil life may seem startling to the reader. But the dramatic achievement of the knights of the Graal required the whole picture. The plotting of the sisters and the seduction scenes furnish dramatic motive and prepare us for the story of those knights who abandoned the quest. It must show the temptation resisted by Galahad, temptation that to a high nature was not temptation, as in the scene in the brothel, where the pure knight, born out of the sacramental love of Launcelot and Guenevere, saw but the lily beds. It will be readily understood by all who knew Richard Hovey that he could not have intended to show that Galahad, the typical knight of purity, should have attained his height through any ascetic or otherwise morbid ideal of life. Not by living less than the best but by living all things better than the best is the whiteness of the soul attained. Speaking about Galahad in Taliesin he says: “In him ye shall behold how light can look on darkness and forgive, How love can walk in the mire and take no stain therefrom.” The temptations of physical life, which mostly to the knights of legendary days meant the life of the flesh minus the soul, would not tempt Galahad more than they would many Galahads of later civilizations, —all those men by whom the sacramental nature of love has been really perceived. That Galahad was to be shown in relation to women is apparent. We have the names of women introduced in the list of persons of the Holy Graal who are shown by the notes to be in Galahad's story. It is plain that if Galahad had “died a maid,” as we are told in a very early fragment of “Avalon,” it must have been from the absence from his life of a love as pure as that of which he was born, and because by his very nature nothing less than the spirituality of passion could to him have the name of love. However portentous is the subject of sexual purity in woman, it is still partly a question of legal legitimacy, of social respectability, and of economic convenience. The Galahad, or masculine idea of purity, “The Pure Knight,” one who stood above a knighthood in which loyalty to his lady in all her interests was the very basis of every knight's oath of arms, would be one in whom the renunciation was not a sacrifice of the passional but of the merely sensual. He would be one whom the consciousness of the sacramental love lifted to a plain quite beyond renunciation, —to inspiration. And such a one,— elected to the redemption of lost womanhood by restoring woman's faith in herself and love, through her faith in the untempting and untemptable man,— the Galahad of the “Poem in Dramas” would have been. The Holy Graal brings into direct contrast the characters of two illegally born sons, Mordred and Galahad. One is of superhuman goodness and power, the other of diabolical selfishness. Modred, tool of fate, gives opportunity to draw a character bruised and marred by his untoward relation to his environment; one, having not only a soul born to discords, but a life full of deprivations in the direction of family life and love and social opportunity, by lack of legal inheritance; all this with that virility in brain and body so often found outside of birth from the easy debauchery of married-life-propinquity. Galahad one day finds himself called bastard. But he is one of those who many wear the word as a star on his brow, a consecration on his life, an invisible angel thought—such as some souls feel floating over them,—and in the great moments of life touching upon consciousness. There are parents wickedly below the law of what makes a wholesome order for all. There are also those so subject to psychological law that they live above the order of the many. Mordred's ill-starred life arose among the former, Galahad's immaculate conception gave him being among the latter. One might almost say that the whiteness of Galahad was like the whiteness of light, made up of all colors, out of which, as in diamond brilliance, all color could flash, rather than any mere purity of cleanly, opaque, earthly white. In this connection one remembers the diamond sphere which Taliesin saw in the Graal chapel when Uriel knighted him poet, the diamond sphere a transparent light itself, flashing all colors, symbol of a wisdom containing all knowing, from clear heavenly blue through the burning spirit of yellow to the warm red flame of earthly things. It was in the Holy Graal that Launcelot and Guenevere were to renounce their personal good in the service of society, Launcelot to go on the quest of the Graal and Guenevere to take up her cross by returning to Arthur and her rôle as mother of the realm. How inadequate a solution this action proved may be suggested by the one page of this play in which Guenevere meets Arthur. The situation is once more truly tragic, there being no solution. Turn which way she would she saw sin and suffering, the sacrifice of inner purity if she returned and the sacrifice of the peace of the realm if she did not. The dignified ending of Tennyson's Guenevere in a convent, full of gentle deeds and repentance for her great sin in not having “loved the highest,” stands in marked contrast to her rôle in Richard Hovey's poem. Launcelot's confession to Dubric and his soliloquy before Rome bring to view, however, the pain he suffered at this point of his experience and show once more that the central character in the whole series of dramas is one not placed in the list of persons. That character is the social system of the age. After the departure of the knights on the quest of the Graal, the court at Camelot would have resumed its ordinary routine of life. All through Southern and Northern Europe during the few hundred years in which we place the story of the Round Table, Courts of Love were of frequent occurrence. We find that a Court of Love was planned for one of the acts of “The Holy Graal.” The falcon carrying the scroll with the laws which were to govern in these courts was said to come from Broceliande, a sometime location in the Arthur myths. So, doubtless, this naïve and interesting code, administered by a concourse of the great ladies of each locality, seems to have had great influence in the formation of the standards and customs regarding the behavior of both ladies and lovers through all Europe. These Courts of Love are credited by high authority as having created manners. This could not be without there being underneath a marked influence upon morals. In fact, the early history of woman, first in an accidental relationship to man, then as something owned, and later as party to a marriage bargain without any pretense to what has lately been called romantic love, culminated in a condition of society in which spiritual and mystical personal attractions were recognized—and lived, with loyalty according to the ordinances of these “Courts” by persons not married to one another and also when either party might be stably married to some other. Better a world with the love of the heart in it, even outside of marriage, than not at all. Naturally jealousies and dissensions arose, and by degrees husbands and wives began to see as the ideal, and to expect in marriage, friendship, and those mystic relations of affectionate loyalty which have now so completely become the ideal, that we must read history to remind us that our present expectation, even if it is not our constant attainment, is a wide advance upon martial conditions in earlier days. Having found the relations between love and the doctrine of the trinity in human kind, we now see that the greatest happiness and the best birth have their origin in an inextricable combination of physical, mental, and emotional attraction. Our present ideal of love has come to include— on the physical plane—sensation, sympathy, instinct; then sentiment, adoration, intuition in the emotions; and judgment and conscience as the results of reason. Such an ideal of love had the author of Launcelot and Guenevere. DIGEST OF THE HOLY GRAAL, MADE UP FROM THE FRAGMENTS AND STRAY NOTES LEFT BY MR. HOVEY. The play opens at the Castle of Morgause, Queen of Orkney, with a scene of evil counsel between Morgause and Morgana, her sister. Then Lamoracke, the lover of Morgause, comes to bid her good-by, saying that he has sworn a vow since he left her three days before; that a great wonder has happened at the Court of King Arthur, for Galahad, son of Launcelot, has taken the seat at the Round Table which Merlin, the Magician, had called the Siege Perilous, in which no man might sit and live until one came for whom it waited; that a vision of the Holy Graal had appeared to them assembled; and that Gawaine swore an oath, which they had all sworn after him, that for a twelvemonth and a day they would seek the Graal. Morgause lures Lamoracke away from the idea of the quest and wins him to herself again, he thus being the first knight to fail in the performance of the vow. Launcelot, before going on the quest confesses to Dubric, Archbishop of Canterbury, who gives him his blessing. Arthur does not wish his knights to leave the Court and go on the quest of the Graal; but on seeing that Launcelot is determined to go, he bids him God speed. Galahad then enters the hall and is by Launcelot presented to the king; then Arthur and Galahad are left alone together. In the garden of Camelot we are introduced to Madelon, the saintly sister of Sir Percival, and Sendal, the temptress. The influence of these two women follows Galahad throughout the play; and from the notes we believe that Madalon dies, as in Malory's story, and that Sendal repents on realizing the purity and strength of Galahad, who releases her from her own evil nature as he did the prisoners in the “Castle of the Maidens” in the early legend. Before leaving the Court, Launcelot and Galahad bid Guenevere good-by, and a scene between these three is the end of the first act. After the departure of the Graal knights a “Court of Love” is held in the garden at Camelot, at which Arthur the King, Taliesin the poet, Dagonet the jester, Kaye the Lord Seneschal, the sad Galahault, Mordred, Agravaine, Guenevere, Fata Morgana and the women of the Court are present. Mordred and Agravaine, who have lingered after the departure of the other knights, say that they never really intended to seek the Graal. At Tintagel, Morgause, Lamoracke and Agravaine plot together to send Sendal and Guimere, disguised in men's clothes, to meet the Graal knights on the road pretending to be desirous of joining the quest and then to seduce them from the performance of their vow. Galahad and Percival on their journey arrive at a beautiful garden which turns out to be the courtyard of a brothel, and there they meet Sendal and Guimere. In the next act we have the attempt to carry out this plan. “The fickle Gawaine,” who has already fallen in love again, has resisted that new love and continued the quest. Riding through the mountains, the Graal knights meet the women in their masculine disguise. The women, being attacked in revenge for their treachery, are saved by Galahad. Then Sendal confesses the plot, which implicates Morgause and Lamoracke. Gawaine, Morgause's son, furious at his mother and at Lamoracke, her lover, turns back for vengeance. Meanwhile at Camelot Guenevere attempts to harmonize the tragic situation by turning to Arthur. Renunciation fails. Gawaine goes to Tintagel and kills his mother and Lamoracke; then utterly disheartened, turns to his new love and gives up the quest of the Graal. In another scene we are at Camelot again with King Arthur and Guenevere. A note for the last scene of the fourth act shows it to have been between Galahad and Launcelot at Glastonbury, outside the Abbey, whither Launcelot comes on the miraculous ship which brings also the body of Madelon after her vicarious death. Here Galahad attains the Graal. From here Launcelot, broken in spirit, wanders away and is in the next play, “Astolat,” cared for by Elaine and finally restored to strength, goes to Camelot only to pass through new sunderings in the experience of the death of Elaine and the jealousy of Guenevere, and the death of Arthur in the next play. The last act is at Camelot. The Court is assembled in the garden when Bors and Launcelot return. The play closes with a scene between Launcelot and Guenevere. ASTOLAT An Idyllic Drama. PERSONS.

Not from our wills it sprang, This love of ours that overcame our will, Then from the will of God—for every effect Must have a will somewhere behind it. Oh, Guenevere, in the sad separate days When silence and absence had bred in my soul the thought of the possibility that you had ceased to love me, I have cried out in horrified imagination, “False, false!” Then, more just, moaned to myself, “All's not lost yet. I love her still. Who was I that she ever should have loved me?” NOTES ON ASTOLAT The story in this play was to be the reunion of the lovers after the experiment of renunciation of self had failed, also the reunion after the discord of the Elaine episode. As “The Marriage of Guenevere” embodies his thought about the influence of parents over the marriage of their children, and “The Birth of Galahad” shows the deeper experiences of mother and wife in what he calls “The True Family”; as Taliesin deals with art and the Graal with the problem of renunciation and chivalry, so “Astolat” was to show forth the intricacy of personal experience. It was a late addition to the series and was planned for the purpose of touching the psychology of the discords in a love. The greater the love the better the environment required to keep it in that growth which is its only life. The great difficulty of adjusting love to its environment, however, must not hide the possibility of destruction from within, the danger treated in “Astolat.” Until two lovers are perfect humans every love has dangers from within. For love is harmony, and love is at every point dependent upon every point of the lover's love and every quality of the lover's character. Love is at once the ultimate desire and ultimate gift of the lover. Doubt of the entire gift or the entire desire is the foundation of jealousy, and this does not of necessity need a third person to be the object of envy or hatred. But the third party externalizes the situation and is dramatically valuable, especially in a poem intended for the theater, as was “Astolat.” To a women like Guenevere, to whom love represented the inevitableness of the nature of things, a real jealousy would have meant destruction of all she had experienced of the harmonies of life, and have brought about, not temper like the jewel scene of Tennyson's Guenevere, for example, but tragic deeds. Destruction doubtless, perhaps of Launcelot, perhaps of the network of relations between them; possibly of the small and helpless Elaine, who would have had to be put out of the possibility of harming a great love like theirs, as one might dismiss any intrusive, unrelated thing from a great presence. Guenevere was too sure of Launcelot's love to envy any tenderness he seemed to give Elaine or any other, but her anger, that, in the face of feelings of such mystic might, there should be any moment of a lesser emotion, any cause for fear of a discord in the harmony, was natural; and such a nature as Launcelot's would in all loyalty have been beautifully tender and sympathetic to the lovelorn Elaine, giving thus more than provocation to any half understanding of his character in Guenevere. An inherent element of jealousy comes from the wound to personal dignity, a thing it is one of the chief objects of life to attain. Personal worth represents the sum of living. It is the stewardship of the soul, the measure of the deeds of a life. Proud natures suffer most in jealousy. The poignancy of pain is for loss of self-respect as well as for loss of love. When personal dignity is lessened, resentment is natural. The greater, or rather the more complex and mystic and miraculous, the nature of a love, the greater is its value. Thus is it worthy of a greater care. But of more importance still is the seldom considered truth that the greater is its need of protection. In another play, “The Lady of the Sonnets,” the author had planned to show what happened in a Shakespeare's heart when faith died. “Astolat” was to show what was requisite to obliterate jealousy from the life of a Launcelot and Guenevere. Up to a certain point the elaboration of a structure, be it man, animal, or the intricately knit up relations of two souls, strengthens the unit. But there is, still beyond, a degree of harmony, which becomes a kind of specialization of function and ministers to life in its highest phases, yet is less self-preservative than forms in the earlier stages of evolution, and thus it is with great loves. The long continuance of a love then is not, as popularly considered, the test of the greatness of the love. The character of a love, the joy it gives, the inspiration it is to either lover, the beautiful births it leads to, in offspring or in the two personalities, measure its worth. These things show its quality. Time can only increase its number of opportunities. The common use of the word jealousy covers many shades of meaning. Confusion sometimes arises as to the dividing line between envy and jealousy. One is jealous of a thing he considers his own and wishes to keep. One is envious of that which he wishes to have for his own, although he admits it to be another's. One who is envious is a would-be thief, one who is jealous is only selfish. The selfishness may even degenerate into greed. So far as the one he loves is concerned it is pure selfishness unrelieved by those magnanimous, generous and loving attitudes in which he would be willing to let the loved one have the small liberties of kindness and sympathy toward others, or to receive the gift of the love of others. These are the exacting ones about the payment of that which was originally a free gift. It would seem that the sense of ownership should be held loose enough to give personal liberty, and the possibility of continual giving without demand. Jealousy becomes more ignoble in proportion as it contains envy. The ignoble elements in jealousy are suspicion, selfishness, the meagre faith, all implying doubt of the loyalty of the loved one, also doubt of self-worth, the last degradation possible, and the last insult to one who has loved us. A lesser love is proven and a greater insulted by jealousy. There is but one cure for jealousy—love. Love for the intruder, or such love of the loved one as gives gladness of his delight even at personal loss. How a wise and generous person's ability to conquer the passion by rousing through great love some overmastering kindly emotion; how love of the offending rival may drown jealousy; how generosity, pity even, and all the kindly passions furnish the means of conquering jealousy; were sure to have been embodied in “Astolat,” where Launcelot's obligation of gratitude and friendship to Elaine were to cause Guenevere's jealousy. The all-conquering love that breeds a faith that has no fear, that submerges even pride and arms against scorn and ridicule, was the type of love exampled by Launcelot and Guenevere in the culmination of their lives in the “Poem in Dramas.” How jealousy may be prevented by clear sight of one's worth in the eye of the beloved object, by consciousness of the gift one gives, of its suitability to the need of the other, by unswerving continued gift, even under circumstances that might cause fear of loss, was part of the theme of “Astolat.” Psychological jealousy demands mental perception of value and enthusiasm or emotional force in enjoying the perception. A character is also capable of guarding jealously a loved thing in proportion to its capacity for appreciation. All human passions admit of evolution into more and more exalted phases, according to the great admixture of qualities in the persons or the complexity of environing events, and jealousy is not an exception. In considering jealousy as a lower passion, it might be suggested that even love would seem so if only its commonest phases were considered. All the poets have written of love at its loveliest development. But jealousy has been thus far chiefly described in its simplest and most brutal conditions. One might say that jealousy is as yet unwritten by the poets. The contending reindeer drives off the other male to win his doe. The jealous man of little moral and intellectual growth kills his rival to have a clear path to his love. Othello, grandest of jealous heroes in English poetry, goes a step higher, paying Desdemona the compliment of blaming her, and also the compliment of not being willing to live when she is dead and proven innocent. This is jealousy at its worst, producing all the destruction possible—death to both Othello and Desdemona. The passions may be considered as destructive or productive. Jealousy, if mainly destructive, is also preservative of that exclusive unity of relation which is doubtless beneficial to the magnetic conditions, in the exclusion of inharmonious magnetisms so important to the sensitive states of motherhood. The reason then why we require all the attentions of a lover is an instinct resulting from racial experience and through social necessity. No passion wholly painful, and so largely destructive, could have reached the present development of jealousy as a human attribute had it not some inherent necessity for being. As with other bad passions, is not jealousy the excessive development of a good one? This purity of relationship, mystic and magnetic as well as emotional, seems to have lain in the author's mind as an ultimate attainment for which no sacrifice was too great a price to pay;—the empire, the church, friendship, and loyalty to a royal friend, all being here set over against the preservation of the true family. Since the marriage of Guenevere made the attainment of this condition more difficult than in the usual family, jealousy adds another element to the tragedy. Here in the merest sketch of the theme are a few of the many facets Richard Hovey would have reflected the light from in “Astolat.” FATA MORGANA A Masque Author's Notes for Fata Morgana.

NOTES ON FATA MORGANA Of “Fata Morgana” he says in the Schema: “It suggests the ethical drift of the series.” The foregoing early study indicates that in “Fata Morgana”—sometimes called “The Masque of Ethics”—he would have embodied his views regarding the Trinity. The three masques would have involved his philosophy. The Morgana was to have treated ethics somewhat as the masque of Taliesin treats æsthetics. It is easy to see that from the unity, which means unrelatedness through the duality, which means contention by opposition, to the trinity, which means inter-action, personality is a psychological evolution which he had outlined for this masque. The word Hellenic used here instead of Hegelian, modern, or Christian, probably indicates that he would have used the Trinity in physical beauty as his symbol in the masque. As Taliesin presented the education, consecration, and function of the artist, so the “Masque of Evil” must have finally embodied the rôle of religion, or the philosophy of religions, in the evolution of evil or discord into good or harmony. He found himself facing the Hindoo unity, then the philosophy of duality, which he dramatically represented under the name of Persian in the outline, and the Persian guest in the characterization. Later the trinity brought him to what he had called Hellenic Unity in Complexity, or what he later might have called Christian or Human Unity in Trinity. “The Masque of Evil,” a study of the problem of good and evil, was a natural product from the author of the essay “The Duece, or Goethe's and Marlow's Faust.” This essay, read at the School of Philosophy at Farmington when he was twenty-five, was doubtless to this poem what a sketch is to a painting: hardly a cartoon, but the preliminary thought digested somewhat in mind but without the sacramental form which at once discovers and manifests. But the deeper development of his conception of the rôle of evil in the cosmos, which in those last ten years would have been prepared to be blazened by his genius in “Fata Morgana, The Masque of Ethics,” can only be guessed by those who know the trend and deepening of his thoughts in that time. ANGRO-MAINYUS I am the Most High God; Worship thou me! Put not up vain prayers to avert my wrath, For my wrath shall fall like the thunderbolt And thou shalt be cleft asunder as an oak. I am Angro-mainyus, the Most High God. Cry not unto me for mercy, for I am merciless. Sin and Death are my ministers, And my ways are ways of torture and the shedding of blood. I am the Lord thy God. I am the Destroyer. My sword is as fire in the forest; My feet are inexorable. Ask me not to deliver thee from evil. I am Evil. Ahura-mazda is God too, The beneficent one, the saviour! He dwelleth in the Sun, But I in the terror of tempests. There are two thrones, but one God. The waves of the sea war mightily, But in the deeps there is calm. Ahura-mazda and I are one God; There is war between our legions, But in us peace. Behold, he knoweth my thoughts and I his, And there is no discord in us. He worketh in light And I in darkness; His ways and my ways are asunder. But blaspheme not, calling me “Devil,” Neither saying, “There are two Gods;” I am the Most High God, And I and Ahura-mazda are one. KING ARTHUR A Tragedy PERSONS. Arthur, King of Britain.

SCENE I. —Near Camelot. A Rocky Gorge in the Mountains. A Castle in the distance. Bugles. King Arthur. Knights and Attendants, in hunting dress, appear on a ledge, looking across the chasm at the ledge opposite, where the deer has leaped and disappeared. Huntsmen, with dogs, scramble down the side of the Gorge and begin to climb the opposite cliff,—with them Sir Lionel. Huntsmen. Hallo! Hallo! Illo-ho-ho! Hallo! Lionel. Send round your horses by the upper pass. Dismount! This way—this way! [King Arthur and others turn back with the horses, and are afterward heard further up, crossing the Gorge. Others, among them Sir Ector, Sir Agravaine, Sir Mordred, Sir Gawaine, Sir Gaheris and Sir Gareth, follow Lionel. Gawaine falls in descending the rocks. Gaheris and Gareth rush to his assistance.] Mordred (aside to Agravaine). Come back! [Exeunt all but Gawaine, Gaheris, Gareth, Mordred and Agravaine.] Ector [without]. Illo-ho! [Bugles.] Gareth. Are you hurt, brother? Gaheris. Pray God, he be not killed! Agravaine. He is but stunned. [Gawaine stirs.] Mordred. Are you much hurt, Gawaine? Gawaine. I hardly know. Give me your hand again. My head is light.—What, all my brothers out O' the chase for me! This is too brotherly. Mordred. That was a perilous fall. Are no bones broken? Gawain [walking, moving his arms, etc.] I fell no pain, only a numbness that Is less already. Come, it is not too late To overtake them yet. [Starts quickly, staggers and holds out his hand to Mordred.] Let me sit down. There's something sprained here. Mordred. Rest you here a space; And when your rebel nerves grow orderly, We'll help you to a horse. Gawaine. It irks me much That Lionel, not I, shall kill the deer. Gareth. Ector will press him close. Gewaine [with whimsical chagrin]. It will be Lionel; But, Lionel or Ector, still not I. Mordred. Marked you that Launcelot is not with the hunt? Gawaine. What castle is that yonder? Agravaine. You know it well,— Castle Carniffel. Gaheris. Where the King confines Our Aunt, Morgana, whom they call the Fay. Gawaine. What, have we come so far? Mordred. Confines? He might Confine as well the air. Gareth. Weird tales are told Of her enchantments there. Men say, she is seen I' the clouds, and builds strange palaces of mist Shot through with sunlight; the which, as you approach, Melt into hideous shapes of boar and fish, Beaked horrors, jowled and jag-browed monstrousness; And at a sudden all will disappear And the bare world jut forth like a baseless dream. Gawaine. Why, since she dwells so near, for all men's tales, We'll claim her hospitality. Garath. The King Will take it ill that any of his knights —Most, we that are his kin—should have to do With one in his displeasure. Gawaine. I meddle not With their dissension. She is yet our aunt As well as the King's sister. She will hardly Bar us the door. Come, rest we there to-night. [They wind the morte without.] Mordred. The deer is slain. This was a goodly chase. The day is nearly over. Launcelot Has lacked good sport. I marvel he came not. Agravaine. I marvel not; nor do you neither, brother, If you would speak your heart. And as for sport, Our hunting is the manlier, and yet I think he would not say he had lacked sport. Gawaine. Do I mistake or does the west begin To show a faint flush o'er the mountain tops? Agravaine. I wonder that we are not all ashamed To see how Launcelot dallies by the Queen Daily and nightly, and we all know it so. By God, it is disloyal of us all That we should suffer such a noble king To be so shamed! Gawaine. Pray you, no more of this. I am not of your counsel, you know well. Gareth. So help me God, I will not go with you. Gaheris. Nor I. Mordred. Then I will. Gawaine. I believe that well; For never yet was brood of mischief got, Thou didst not run to dandle it. Would ye both Would be less busy, for too well I know What will befall of it. Agravaine. Fall what fall may, I will unfold it to the King. Gawaine. Nay, hear me; And do not in your folly pull your vengeance Down on yourselves and all of us. Imperil not The empire. Know you not, if war arise 'Twixt Launcelot and our house, how many lords, Great princes and the knightliest of our order, Will hold with Launcelot? Brother, Sir Agravaine, You cannot have forgot how many times He hath delivered Arthur and the Queen. Ay, and the best of us full oft had been Cold at the heart-root, had not Launcelot Been by to prove a better knight than we. Ungrateful as ye are, do ye forget How when ye both and threescore others lay Chained in that cruel dungeon of Penmore— Who was it then but Launcelot whose might Saved you from death in torments? Brother, methinks It claims a memory. Agravaine. Do as ye list; I will not hide it longer. [Bugles.] [Enter King Arthur, Knights and Huntsmen, with the deer.] Song. Oh, who would stay indoor, indoor, When the horn is on the hill? [Bugle: Tarantara.] With the crisp air stinging, and the huntsmen singing, And a ten-tined buck to kill! Before the sun goes down, goes down, We shall slay the buck of ten; [Bugle: Tarantara.] And the priest shall say benison, and we shall ha'e venison, When we come home again. Let him that loves his ease, his ease, Keep close and house him fair; [Bugle: Tarantara.] He'll still be a stranger to the merry thrill of danger And the joy of the open air. But he that loves the hills, the hills, Let him come out to-day. [Bugle: Tarantara.] For the horses are neighing, and the hounds are baying, And the hunt's up and away. [Exeunt Huntsmen with deer, the Knights following dispersedly. The King observes Gawaine and his brothers, who converse apart.] Gawaine. Be silent, brother. Agravaine. I will not. Mordred. Nor will I. Gawaine. Then go your gait! I will not hear your scandals nor abet you. Gaheris. Nor I. Gareth. Nor I, for I will ne'er speak evil Of Launcelot. Alas, now is the fate Fallen on the Kingdom. Gawaine. And the fellowship Of the Round Table shall be clean dispersed. [Exeunt Gawaine, Gaheris and Gareth.] Arthur. What quarrel is this, nephews? Agravaine. Sir, we conceived, Mordred and I, that duty is to speak, Not easy pleasant words men love us for, But bitter truth and hard to him that hears And perilous to the speaker. Arthur. Assuredly: He that deceives me of the enemy's force To save me from to-day's discouragement, Jeopards my cause to-morrow. Agravain. Sir, our three brothers Held otherwise and, as you saw, for this Fell out with us and left us. Arthur. For naught else? Why, 'tis but thought. Think wrongly as you will, You harm no one in that. But men will seek Occasion for dispute in pimpernels Ere they will lack a quarrel. Mordred. Put it that A man had in his treasury much gold And thought no more on't, having at his belt The key that kept all safely; yet there was An ingress to his hoard he knew not of, And secretly by night another came Thereby and spoiled him. He, good soul, secure In bolts and bars, rich only in conceit, Went, carrying his key to empty space, And dreamt no evil. Were it well or no To break in roughly on his easy smiling With “Sir, you are robbed! Too late to save your gold, But time, small comfort, yet to catch the thief”? Arthur. Why, who would be the fool of dreams? Surely The waking world whose shows betray us not Is better than a sleep where we may walk O'er any brink to death. Mordred. [Kneeling.] Sire, your own words For pardon if our speech offend! Yourself Are he that keeps the key of the rifled room, Your Queen the gold, and he that pilfers her —Alas, to say 't!—your bravest knight, your friend, Launcelot. Arthur. Sirs, ye are bold to brave me thus. Reck ye the danger? Agravaine. We speak that we do know. Our lives be forfeit if it prove not true. Mordred. Upon your hint I spoke. Lay not to us Aught other end but honor. Are we not Your sister's sons?—what more, but let that pass.— Agravaine. This concerns us and all our house as well As you, King Arthur. If you do us wrong, Will men think you do shame to your own blood, Unless for some strange secret? Arthur. Will you dare? Before me?—Have my kindred been so leal That I should make them keepers of my honor? Mordred. The bond of blood abides. I do but dread Lest others should say this; and say besides Your love for Launcelot had made you rather Be ignorant, so you might deem him true, Than seek the truth that haply might reveal Him traitor—doubly traitor that your love, Yours whom he wrongs, so shield him. God be witness I speak not only for my honor's sake, Being of your blood, but for the love I bear you. Arthur. Son, son, if I could trust you! What you work That I hold evil, may seem good to you; At least I will believe so. But to be Assured you love me, to have evidence Your crooked seeming cloaks nobility, That would so rest my heart I could endure What else ill chance shall bring, and think it light. Mordred. God pardon me my life and all amiss I have done in it; and you too, my lord, Pardon me. But in this I do no evil. My heart swells like a troubled sea to think That you should be so wronged. Arthur. I have such will That you should be as fair as you would seem, I make my hope half credence. For this tale Of Launcelot and my Queen, I long have known There were such slanders in the court, and paid Small heed to them. Ye know not Launcelot. Were the devotion that he shows the Queen Tenfold what it hath been—nay, if he loved her As you would have it that he does, he would Not trespass on my right. I might to-day Depart my kingdom and leave Guenevere With him till my return, and be as safe As had I left her in a nunnery. Mordred. Alas, that such a noble trust should be So traitorously rewarded! Send word You'll not return to Camelot to-day, But spend the night in yonder castle. Indeed, 'Twill be dark traveling if we do return, For see, the sun is setting. Launcelot Will haste to Guenevere. Sir Agravaine And I will, with twelve others, secretly Steal back to Camelot, leaving you here, And take them in the deed. If we should fail, Then we will answer Launcelot in the lists With the appeal to arms. Arthur. That would mean death To both of you. Mordred. Right well we know it, Sire, Unless God fought with us. Arthur. Well, be it so. Cost what it may, the scandal must be stopped By proof or disproof. Mordred. Go to the castle; Sir Agravaine will guide you. I will send The courier to the Queen, recall the knights And bid them join you yonder. Arthur. Is not that The castle of Morgana? Mordred. It is yours, Sire; You are the King. Arthur. Be it so. Come, Agravaine. And thou, Sir Mordred, pray That you may live to see the end of this. [Exeunt Arthur and Agravaine. The sunset has faded away into one dull red line. The scene darkens. A lone bugle sounds far down the pass.] Mordred. Well played and won!—Now to recall the knights. [Sounds his bugle and waits, listening. Two ravens, startled, flap their wings and fly about, croaking, in the tree-tops. A bugle without answers. Mordred blows a second time and looks up, as the ravens stir again above.] Men say ye are the Devil's ministers And run upon his errands. Seek him, then, And croak the news in Hell! Soft, I mistake; For I serve Heaven. I but bring to pass God's justice on the scorners of His law. [Enter a Huntsman. The ravens stir and croak again.] The King to-night returns not to the palace. Go, call the hunt together and convey them To yonder castle on the cliff. Make speed! [Exit Huntsman.] Brr! It grows dark apace, and the night air Makes the flesh creep and shiver. [Bugles, off, calling and answering. The ravens suddenly rise, croak and fly away with a great flapping of their wings.] [Enter Morgana. Mordred starts and fingers his sword-hilt nervously.] Morgana. It is I, Mordred. Gawaine is at the castle. So I learned That you were here, parted from him in anger. Mordred. Ay, we have lost him. Agravaine must needs, Like a blunt fool, blurt out what I had else With craft suggested. Our over-nice Gawaine, I fear, is frighted to the other side. But Arthur has been won. [Bugles, off, calling and answering.] Hear you the horns? They sound the prelude of our mastery. I, seeing the wind in the sails, jumped to the helm And guided all through safely. Ere the King Could hear of aught from others, I so wrought He yielded to our plan. Morgana. When is it to be? [The wind rises in the trees. Noises of the night. An occasional bugle far off. Lights appear at the castle.] Mordred. To-night. The King sleeps at your castle. I, With Agravaine and twelve beside, return To Camelot, where we do think to take The Queen and Launcelot. Morgana. I would it had Been later. Yet the auguries are well. My prescience bodes some mishap on the way; But you shall win. Last night, being in a trance, [An owl hoots.] I saw your mother's spirit. And she cried Out with a loud voice, “Mordred! Mordred! Mordred! Through him his father's ancient wrong to me Shall be avenged.” Mordred. Ay, but the crown, the crown! Morgana. “Let him fear not,” she cried. “He shall be crowned. The King shall have no child by Guevenere; But shall renounce her, and acknowledge Mordred, Though bastard, for his heir.” Mordred. It shall go hard But I will make the prophecy come true. Come to the castle! [Exeunt. Noises of the night. The scene closes.] Scene II. —Camelot. The Queen's Apartments: A room with heavy paneling of oak and great oaken rafters. The walls are hung with tapestries. At the left a window, showing the heavy masonry of which the building is constructed. At the right a door with hangings, leading into other rooms of the suite. At the center, a heavy barred door, that opens into the general corridors. In the alcove, couch nearly concealed with hangings. Low seats covered with skins, etc. Launcelot and Guenevere. Guenevere. And still you do not speak. Think you of him?—the King? Must I believe You love him more than me? Launcelot. Oh, Guenevere!— Your bond to him is formal, mine as real As—God in heaven! as real as mine to you. Guenevere. NOTES ON KING ARTHUR. As to the choice of the heir, there is no authoritative note, but I have a vague memory that Borre, the child of Lionors, who had been educated by the good and wise Taliesin, was to be named heir. Borre appears as a charming child in the first play, the “Marriage of Guenevere,” and without appearing, he became a strong dramatic figure in the lost manuscript, where his mother, the lady Lionors, is being wrought upon by Morgause in the depth of her wicked revel on the occasion of the temptation of Lamoracke. Here most dramatic words pass between the mother and Morgause, the insolent temptress of the youth. Borre's name is first introduced by Morgause when, before the marriage, she eases her hatred of Arthur by hinting to Guenevere that he is not all she might have pictured in her ideal, referring to the lady Lionors and her child, and linking her name by innuendo with that of Arthur. The play of King Arthur was to contain a final conflict in the mind of the honor-tortured Launcelot, between his love and his friendship. He had lost no time in rescuing Guenevere after Arthur had executed the law of the land by condemning her to be burnt—that being the punishment for high treason in queens. For more than twenty years Arthur had refused to listen to rumors or in any way doubt Guenevere, but once proven in guilt by Mordred and his associates, Arthur, who stood for public justice, condemned her. After the rescue, Launcelot, who puts personal loyalty before the law, felt that Guenevere was now his. He took her to Joyous Gard, which was the court of his father's kingdom before the kings gave up their thrones to join Arthur's Round Table. Arthur besieged Joyous Gard to recapture Guenevere. Launcelot unhesitatingly defended the place against Arthur. When, however, he knew that Mordred had seized the throne and that Arthur must turn back to defend himself again Mordred, he went forth to Arthur's assistance, but not without a great conflict between his desire to loyally see justice done to Arthur against Mordred, and his anger, probably the greatest anger of his knightly life, against the man who had condemned Guenevere to torturing death by fire. To Launcelot right was above the law. To Arthur the law was above any view of right or wrong. To Dubric, the priest, we remember, the Church was above either. And these three classes continue to this day, the Arthurs, the Launcelots, the Dubrics. A great jurist has said: “He who taketh the law of the land for his sole guide is neither a good neighbor nor an honest man.” In this discussion Guenevere joins. Guenevere could see Launcelot defend her but not revenge her. She urges him to do the generous deed. Bors also belongs to this scene; the noble, frank cousin who from the first and always stood his ideals and Launcelot side by side. To Launcelot there was but one crime to be done in the name of love, and that was love itself. Love must inspire to all good deeds, to sacrifice, to generosity, to forgiveness. So he goes to Arthur's rescue. The plot of King Arthur is indicated in the scenario. The first scene is written. Of the second scene, being the love scene upon which Mordred breaks, we have but a few lines. It was planned to show the development and beauty of love after the passage of all those years, after the experiences of absence, sorrow, remorse, the attempt at renunciation, after the wounding and healing of the discord of jealousy. We do not know how the author would in this scene have shown a greater love than that pictured in the temptation of Launcelot in “The Birth of Galahad,” but we know that was what he was to do. From this time on Launcelot's love would be expressed by deeds, the rescue and so forth, and Guenevere's by her defense of herself in court and her general nobility of attitude in all matters, showing that her love being good had made her good—more, noble. A noble love develops itself and its lovers, ever to higher possibilities; or, if it be destroyed, to ever higher loves. This theory of the ever-growing beauty of love was a central theme in the “Poem in Dramas.” The trial scene would have been Guenevere's greatest scene in the series. Here her greatness and goodness must all have been shown to stand in contrast with the power of the law over her. It was long discussed whether the rescue should be from the court scene, to avoid falling into physical drama if it took place at the fire scene. But the court scene had to stop at a moral climax, the characters being Arthur, Guenevere, and the Law. The death of Arthur in personal conflict with Mordred, each at the end of the battle killing the other, and Launcelot's too late arrival occupies the foreground when Guenevere, in the falling darkness enters with the monks, who, carrying torches, go about to shrive the dying and bury the dead. So the tragedy remains. Arthur is dead, and sorrow has fallen upon all the land. Only in Avalon “the place of peace,” can we look for those resolutions of discord which the spirit of man still awaits. DIGEST OF KING ARTHUR MADE UP FROM THE FRAGMENTS AND STRAY NOTES LEFT BY MR.

Argent. [States the great law of suddenness in appearance. Reconciliation of Plutonic and Neptunian theories (vide Hartmann's Unconscious). Slow preparation in the unconscious. Conscious sudden at end of process.] Launcelot. The atmosphere of souls, the ether In which they swim like stars, is God himself. In Him they live and move and have their being. The power that holds each spirit in its place And melts the heaven of souls in harmony Is love that draws each spirit to its neighbor; And as the various spaces of the stars, So soul from soul is variously severed. I love my fellows as earth loves the stars That move far off in their own silent courses, Shedding on us a mild beneficence; Others I love as earth loves Uranus, Mars, Venus, Mercury, Saturn and the sun, For these are nearer to me and their courses Inextricably intertwined with mine. But thee, my sweet, my greatest heart of women, Thee do I love as the earth loves the moon. And yet the earth hath something of its own It never told the moon, and the moon hides A silent secret in its charmed heart The earth can never know. Guenevere. And Galahad, thy son, who died a maid? Shall he be ever lonely? Launcelot. For him too Some mystic lady waits in Avalon, That dim mysterious mother-land of forms. Launcelot. Arthur in Avalon has found his bride, And there is peace between his soul and mine. Launcelot. It doth not now repent me of my sins; They oft were my salvation. But for them I might have lain forever in my dream In the child-hearted valleys. They, like wolves, Roused me from my as yet unearned repose And drove me toiling up this arduous hill Where from the summit now mine eyes look out At peace upon a peaceful universe. Nay, sweet, our sins are but God's thunder-clouds, That hide the glorious sun a little while; And afterwards the fields bring forth their fruit. NOTES ON AVALON. Trying to fancy how he thought of “Avalon” let us find a little the grace of his soul by reminding ourselves of the speech of Uriel to Percival in “Taliesin,”—Percival, the good knight, the practical man, when in contrast with Taliesin, the man of prayer, vision, and song. Uriel. Percival. ... Percival! ... Approach no nearer thy desire, thou of the Choice. The time is not yet. Still the air thy spirit breathes too thickened is with noise Of earth-blown rumors for the thin pulsations of the interstellar voice To stir its sluggard atoms to the unbroken theme the deeps hear and rejoice. Thy heart is yet too full of anger, and the hate of evil clots thy soul; Too far from hell to hate it must he be whom God shall breathe on as a coal Until the pure light of perfection burns about him like an aureole. Pray to the tranquil night to let the calm of stars beneath the silent pole Fall like a mighty hand upon thy spirit, even like the hand of Death. And in that hour when thou art clothed upon with the tranquillity of Death, When Love has cast out even the hate of hate,—Love whom the gods name Death,— Come, and the gates shall open; come, and thou shalt enter in the holy place, See the mask melt into the features of the Living Soul it covers, face The Eyes that all love looks through, feel intense about thee like a burning breath The swift invasion of his heart-beats, the reverberation of his grace. ... With such moral height in the masque of æsthetics what would not have been the mystic whiteness of the peaks of song whence he would have had us worship in his masque of ethics. His nature was most deeply religious. He forgot dogmas in insights, and life in the pure visions born of the impulses of a high and illumined heart. So “Avalon” would not have been merely religious in the conventional sense, but might have soared to those mystic heights where love alone is motive, and act, and reward. As was well said by one of his earliest reviewers: “While the development of the succeeding dramas is dimly outlined and darkly foreshadowed in the enigmatic replies of the awe-inspiring Norns to Merlin's questionings, there is still a deeper intent, revealing in part the poet's philosophy of being; indicating, by means of ideal characters, who, in turn, personify the classical, medieval, and Christian myths, the growth of the religious instinct in man, through varied phases of terror or of beauty, to culminate, at last, in the Christian ideal.” Let it, however, be remembered that “Merlin” was but a partial view of the subject which was to have been supplemented by “Taliesin” and “Morgana”; and finally to reach some state of solution of the whole tangle in a complexity of interaction without tangle, which in the case of the masque “Avalon,” he named Harmonody. The scene of the “Quest of Merlin” being chiefly laid in Avalon, where Merlin and allegorical folk of all degree, from the dryads to the angels, are assembled, indicates that his Avalon is the place of eternity, the place of the beginning and the end. Merlin deals with very primitive seekings for this land and the experience of its infinities. Prophecy is an easy thing in a place where past, present and future are visible; and what matter if they are called Urd, Verdandi, Skuld! Merlin's questioning was a very simple one; whether two mortals should marry. But the Avalon of the masque of that name, although the same, was to be another Avalon. Even as those equal infinities, past and future, which seem so different relatively to us, are one and relatively to themselves the same. For the Harmonody “Avalon,” which was to end the “Poem in Dramas,” we have in the notes but few characters named: Arthur, Guenevere, Launcelot and Galahad. But the evolution of mythologies running through the masques makes it seem likely that all the people of his earth-world and his unreal world as well should have assembled, each making some essential part of the completed harmony. An evolution of societies, governments, religions, an evolution of material conditions, mental conditions, spiritual conditions, was the great groundwork of the “Poem in Dramas.” That work itself was suggested as evolving from simple to complex, from discord to harmony. The masque of Merlin begins with the Norns and ends with the angels and final star prophesies. Taliesin again begins with the magic of the wood, of physical nature and our own nature, and ends with Taliesin's human song going on even terms with the angelic choirs. As Carman said: “Richard never for a moment doubted the ultimate benignity of nature.” Whether this progression from primitive chaos to the holiest flights of human inspiration was to be repeated in “Morgana,” we do not find indicated in the notebooks; but there is no doubt that in its own variation this was what it was to be, and that a like progression was to pass through the masques themselves, each rising to a different height, so that in the end the last, “Avalon,” should be supreme. A harmony is greater as its components are the more unlike, if they still are in each part helpful to every part. Even so the study in ethics, called a “Masque of Evil,” was needed, so that the basic contrast should produce a greater harmony as the discords were resolved in “Avalon.” Somewhere in eternity, not regarding place, all stages of the human race must coexist, regardless of their place in time, and their relation or absence of relation or their experiences. This condition he uses as a place, and calls Avalon.</field>
