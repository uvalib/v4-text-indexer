      <field name="fulltext">JOSEPHINE. The attribution of this poem is uncertain. Thou, who didst seem in youth to be Sustained alike through good or ill, By star, or fate, or destiny, That told thee of a triumph still! While the great hope of future good Dispelled the dreary prison's gloom, Was there no warning understood Of evil also in thy doom? Could not the voice that had such power, To bring thee dreams of future fame, Prepare thee for that after hour, Of deep disgrace and bitter shame? Did not the glass, where thou couldst see The crownÃ¨d queen, and honored wife, E'er show thee, in sad prophecy, Thy worse than widowed close of life? Alas! alas! thy future shows How vain are hope's delusive gleamsâ True wisdom never comes to those, Who trust in sorceries and dreams. No knowledge can avail but this, Of all men ever learned or heard, To know God's will and promises And knowing, take him at his word. Yet in thy darkest hour of shame, Whate'er thy sins and follies past, Who would not pity more than blame, And weep above thy fall at last. Yea, weep for thee, that heavy day, Thou stoodst aside, uncheered, alone, That Austria's beauty might have way To pass unhindered to the throne. Yet lo! how surely future years, Avenge the evils of the past, For all thy sorrows, and thy tears, Thou surely art repaid, at last. And he who hoped by wrong like this, To gain a good for future years, Has shown how less than foolishness Man's wisdom in the end appears. No farther than the meanest may, Could pierce that proud and kingly glance, Thy royal son, not his to day, Wears the imperial crown of France. MARIE LOUISE. The attribution of this poem is uncertain. Who journeys thus onward, Light-hearted and gay, As if to a triumph She passed on her way? No exile, most surelyâ Not thus do they come, Who are leaving behind them A heart and a home. Can she go so lightly, And joyously back, Who went to her bridal So late o'er this track? Could she smile as when hastening To welcoming arms, If shut from the circle Of home and its charms? Oh, matchless in beauty, And kingly in line! No heart of a woman Can surely be thine: Else wouldst thou, this moment, Thy husband uncrowned, Weep in sackcloth and ashes, And sit on the ground. Is this, proud Napoleon, The pride of thy home? Can this be thy mother, O pale king of Rome? Alas! we may mourn thee, But pity who can, More fickle than woman, And falser than man. It was well that the exile, Shut in by the sea, Still might solace his anguish By memory of theeâ Still could keep through all suffering, Of body and mind, One blest spot in memory Where thou wert enshrined; Trusting on in a faith Which no time could remove, In the strength of thy virtue, And depth of thy love; For his heart, but for this, In its hardness had been As the rocks of the ocean That girdled him in. Oh, regally wedded, And regally born! Not thy state nor thy beauty Can save thee from scorn; And more deeply we mourn thee, Content in thy home, Than the Emperor exiled, Or dead king of Rome. CHARLOTTE CORDAY. The attribution of this poem is uncertain. Who is this, with calm demeanor, And with form of matchless grace, Wearing yet the modest beauty Of her childhood in her face? Close the white folds of her kerchief All her neck and bosom wrap, And her soft brown hair is hidden Underneath her Norman cap. And what doth she in such garments, And with such a modest mien, Here among the high-born beauties Of the court of Josephine? This is she who left the convent, For the fierce and restless throngs, Who were gathering head for battle, To avenge her country's wrongs. This is she who to its rescue, Was the foremost to advanceâ She who struck to death the tyrant Of her well beloved France. She who had the martyr's spirit To perform as she had planned; Taking thus her life's sweet promise In her own presumptuous hand. All the while, herself deceiving, With this dangerous subtletry, âEvil, surely, is not evil If a good is gained thereby. âIf I perish for my country, Is not this a righteous deed? If I save the lives of thousands, What is it that one should bleed?â So, arraigned at the tribunal, This alone was her replyâ âIt was I who did this murder, And I do not fear to die.â Therefore, with her simple garments, And her unassuming port, Have they placed her lovely picture Near the beauties of the Court: Therefore pitying admiration, More than blame for her we feelâ Hers was noble and heroic, Though it was mistaken zeal. And so long as France shall honor Those whose blood for her is shed, Shall the name of Charlotte Corday Live among the martyred dead! MADAME ROLAND. The attribution of this poem is uncertain. A mien of modest loveliness, A brow on which no shadow lies, And woman's soul of truthfulness Outlooking from soft hazel eyes: Thy placid features only show, The happy mother, faithful wife, Not her whose fate it was to know All strange vicissitudes of life. Unnoticed in thy youthful days It was thy happy lot to move, Brightening life's unobtrusive ways With the sweet ministries of love, And learning the great truths of life, That best are learned in solitude, But only in its after strife Are ever proved or understood! That toiling early, toiling late, For others, is our highest blissâ Man even, in his best estate, Hath no more happiness than this. Such truth it was, that even there, Where reigned the prison's gloom and chill, Could keep thee wholly from despair, And make thee toil for others still, Till thine own sorrows half forgot, Thy noblest sacrifice was shown, In words and deeds for those whose lot Was far more wretched than thine own. Yet well for thee our tears may flow, Though high thy name emblazoned stands, Thou, with a woman's heart, couldst know No life that woman's heart demands. Happier than thou, with fame and wealth, Is she who cheers earth's humblest place; Leaving no picture of herself, Save in a daughter's modest face. MADAME TALLIEN. The attribution of this poem is uncertain. With a form of wondrous beauty And of most unrivalled grace, With a voice of winning sweetness And a fair and witching face, From the pleasant paths of girlhood She came up with joy elate, And took thoughtlessly upon her All a matron's care and state. And we scarce can ever wonder That her life so careless seemsâ She is now but just emerging From her childhood's thoughtless dreams. And she has not learned the lesson, That can only come with yearsâ That our life is not for pleasure, But for labor and for tears. But behold her, by misfortune, From her height of pleasure hurled; Hath she seen how unsubstantial Are the honors of the world? Doth she view her life as something That was profitless and vain? What hath been to her the discipline Of sorrow and of pain? Alas! that heaviest trial, Lonely thought, and fiery strife, Could not change the heart within her, Nor the purpose of her life. For she lived by fitful impulse, Doing sometimes deeds of good; Sometimes, in red wine washing Out the memories of blood. Reigning as the queen of beauty, With an undisputed claim; Hiding with a crown of roses All her forehead's crimson shame. Yet we would not quite condemn her, Unto perfect infamy, For she seemed to have within her Something better than we see. And she might have added virtue To her beauty and her grace, If her lines of life had fallen In a good and pleasant place. MADAME JUNOT. DUCHESS D'ALBRANTES. The attribution of this poem is uncertain. From her mother earth's kind bosom, Once a vine with tender blossom Lifted up its pretty head. Glad within, how glad without her, Seemed the world that lay about her With its sunshine overspread. In her loveliness and meekness, Knowing all her nature's weakness, And that she alone must fall; Said she, âThis can be no longer, I must lean on something stronger, If I grow or live at all. âAll these trees that stand about me Are but rugged things without me, Wherefore should I be afraid? If I well perform my duty, If I bring them grace and beauty, Surely they will give me aid.â So she listened to the proffer Of an ancient tree, whose offer, Met her first appealing look; To him all her sweetness bringing, With her tendrils round him clinging, She all other aid forsook. But alas! the mournful sequel, Proves that unions so unequal Never in the world are blest. She could neither change nor cover The defects of such a loverâ Neither bless him, nor be blest. Captive only for an hour, Soon a bolder brighter flower Stronger cords about him wound; And that young vine of a summer, Pushed off by the fair new-comer, Fell unheeded to the ground. Lady, with this old true story, Of mistaken trust before thee, And of that poor blossom's fate, Couldst thou not take solemn warning, Nor prepare in life's young morning, For repentance, were too late? Vain example, vain adviser, Still the world will grow no wiser, Still along our way we meet Those from whose unpitying bosom Has fallen off the tender blossom, That lies broken at their feet. MADAME RECAMIER. The attribution of this poem is uncertain. By fortune's favor early raised To a most dangerous place, And bountifully dowered, besides, With loveliness and grace: How didst thou triumph over all Who rose like thee, though but to fall? For thou wert tempted like as theyâ Ay, tempted even moreâ So courted, flattered, and beloved, Was woman ne'er before. Yet strength was given thee from on high To keep thy youth's first purity. All men with true and noble souls Thy firmest friends becameâ While worthless suitors had thy scorn, And fled in guilty shame. Even royalty shrunk back subdued By thy most noble womanhood. By all life's dangers and its trials, So worthy wert thou proved, That they who only saw, admired, And they who knew thee, loved. And for such purity and worth, What was thy recompense on earth? Alas! while shameless infamy Sat in her pride of place, Thy goodness only brought to thee Downfall and sad disgrace. Alas! that justice should bestow, So blindly, her rewards below. Yet who can envy those who rise By wrong to eminence? Or who can pity thee, sustained By conscious innocence? Who would not rather suffer long For right, than but one hour for wrong? Who would not rather have thy thoughts In exile and alone, Than his who kept, by tyranny, An unsubstantial throne? He scarce might number each offenceâ Thine only one was innocence. And whatsoe'er our fates may be, Whether we rise or fall, Still One who sees, not as man sees, Is in, and over all; Bringing, by ways not understood, From earthly evil, heavenly good! PAULINE BONAPARTE. The attribution of this poem is uncertain. Let her name be Queen of Beauty, For her wondrous loveliness; She is worthy of no higher And no better place than this. Not as daughter or as sister, Was she aught we can desire; Not as friend, or wife, or mother, Can we honor or admire. And we scarce dare even whisper, As we pause and read her name âShe had something to redeem her, We can pity while we blame.â For no wisdom came with knowledge, To retrieve a wasted past; Hers was Folly's life of folly, And its crowning act the last. Think of an immortal creature With a soul for endless years, Knowing only selfish pleasures, Weeping only selfish tears. Think of any woman, troubled By no higher thought than thisâ Whether emeralds, pearls, or diamonds Best would grace her loveliness;â Taxing all the little powers Of a vain and foolish brain With the fashion of a turban, Or the border of a train! Yet our Queen of Beauty's vision Of the fullness of delight Was a âfÃªte for every morning, And a ball for every night;â And to live for pleasure only, In a ceaseless round of mirth; This, her estimate of duty, And her value of life's worth. So we call her Queen of Beauty, Yielding to her only claim; For no deed that honors woman Ever beautified her name. All her days were vain and idle, As a vapor or a breath; She was fair, but frail and sinful, In her life and in her death. CAROLINE BONAPARTE. The attribution of this poem is uncertain. From the humblest little blossom To the flowers of tropic climes, All things God has made are lovely, In their seasons and their times. From the farthest star that twinkles, To the sun with dazzling light, Every planet is most glorious In his own appointed height. And the oak tree is no better, Towering in majestic pride, Than the clinging vine, whose verdure Covers all his rugged side. And the nightingale's soft music Falls no sweeter through the dark, Than the clear and ringing matin Of the heaven-ascending lark. Nature always owns God's wisdom; Flower, and bird, and star, and sun, Keep wherever he has placed them, Growing, singing, shining on. When the birds of morn are chanting, Then the nightingale doth rest; Never any lark soars, singing, When she should be in her nest. And each little star rejoices In his empire of a night, As the sun doth, in the slendor Of his own unrivalled light. Only man, of all creation, His true limit doth o'erleap: Only man falls down, by climbing Up to heights he cannot keep. Yet thy rise and fall, fair lady, Makes at least this lesson plain: Haughty pride and usurpation Cannot keep what they can gain. Thou hadst never suffered downfall, And disgrace and banishment; If, in thine own humble station, Thou hadst learned to be content. Hadst thou kept thy feet from places, Where but lawful queens had trod, Claiming this one title only, âWoman, by the grace of God.â MADAME DE STAÃL. The attribution of this poem is uncertain. Alive, thy country's highest Power Still honored, while he feared thy name; Dead, thou hast left a princely dower To nations, who will guard thy fame. Such a proud gift as he who lives For human glory only knowsâ A wealth that grows by what it gives, Increasing when it most bestows. A power, that though his work be done, Who kindles first its beacon light, Widens and brightens, shining on Down through the ages from its height. Such power, such gift, such light was thine, O woman of unequalled mind; And thy great legacy has been, Not for thy country, but mankind. Until a proud posterity, Whose heart remembers to admire, Beats its responses back to thee, And kindles at thy words of fire. And if a name the world admires, And honors with but one accord, Can satisfy the soul's desires, Thou surely hast a great reward. Yet well might thy reward be great, For Justice, with her stern demands, For every good, or soon or late, Asks for her payment at our hands. This was the price she claimed of thee, This heavy sentence, signed and sealedâ âBanishment, during life, to be Neither commuted, nor repealed.â Friends, country, love itself, was lost, Leaving thee nothing but thy fame, Alas! how terrible the cost, For the poor purchase of a name! What human soul for this would part With all the human soul can prize? What woman, with a woman's heart, Would take it at the sacrifice? HORTENSE. The attribution of this poem is uncertain. Reared in that beautiful land where the sun Makes everything which he shines on glad, What, innocent child, couldst thou have done, That thine after life should be so sad! What evil stars in thy sky had met, An influence over thy way to shed; That woe's most woeful crown was set So heavily on thy bright young head? Through all the days of a troubled life, Thine only portion was woe and tears, As a daughter, mother, friend, or wife, Down to the end of thy wretched years. Oh, brighter and better thy lot had been Had thy early love been its own pure guide, And they had been saved from a fearful sin Who broke thy heart in their evil pride. Early in life began thy doom, Of hopeless sorrow and sad disgrace; As the prison shadow's awful gloom, Fell heavily over thy childish face. But bitterer, bitterer still the part Thy womanhood was doomed to fill; Striving to hide away in thy heart A love which thou couldst not crush nor kill. And coming sadly at last to stand Where but happy lovers alone should wed; And give to thy bridegroom only a hand, In place of the heart that was cold and dead. Wedding one whom thou couldst not love, Loving one whom thou couldst not wed, With no hope below, and no hope above, Mourning over a first-born dead; Alas! we can only mourn and weep O'er a wasted, profitless, life-time past, We can only hope thou art well asleep Where the weary rest from their cares at last. M'LLE. LENORMAND. The attribution of this poem is uncertain. What strange power, to us unknown, O'er her early years was thrown, That, within the convent's cell, She should study charm and spell, To discern the things that lie Hidden from our mortal eyeâ Wisely from us still concealed Till their time to be revealed? By what witchery did she bring Statesmen, soldier, priest, and king, In their hour of gloom or hope, To consult her horoscopeâ Thus to learn the good or ill Waiting in their future still? How could she assign their parts By her dark forbidden arts? Haply, she could not discern More than they who came to learn, Could not understand or tell What her power, or whence her spell; Haply, she who spake, believed, If deceiving, still deceived; And in her we only find, That the blind can lead the blind. For it may be, He whose power Shuts from us the future hour, Keeping e'en from angels' ken What he hath prepared for men; When we seek in ways forbid For the knowledge he has hid, Leaves us to believe a lie, And to be destroyed thereby. For we gain no wisdom higher Than the wisdom we desire, Never loud voice from the sky Answers to a feeble cry; Only does the Father speak To the waiting souls that seek Only they his truth have heard Who have sought it in his word. And but this we learn of thee, Child of mournful destiny: Knowledge gained, where faith is lost, Is not worth the fearful cost. God saith, âEvery child who pleads, Shall have answer to his needs; Trust the future unto me, As thy day, thy strength shall be.â MADAME JEROME BONAPARTE. (MISS PATTERSON.) The attribution of this poem is uncertain. No fear of future ill we trace, No mark of sorrow, or of ageâ But a most fair and girlish face Looks on us from the pictured page; Her hopeful face, who came to stand Beside the altar, long ago, And give her willing heart and hand For life, with all its weal or woe; Her happy face, who could not see, In that sweet triumph of her power, How short her dream of bliss would be, How fearful its awakening hour! She could not see that gloom begin, Which o'er her morning sky was thrown, Nor the long weary years wherein She should go down life's vale alone. Ah! well for us, we are forbid To see what path before us liesâ Ah! wisely hath our Father hid The future from his children's eyes. For though the human heart can bear, Daily, its daily weight of woe, Yet, if revealed at once, despair Would break it with a single blow. And God most righteously bestows Our lots, though we be sad, or blest; Our human wisdom only knows, What seems, and not what is, the best. Our needs by Him are understood, His guardian love no child forsakesâ He gives us compensating good For every blessing which he takes. So it may be, that we are cared For most, in darkest hours of gloomâ And, by our very sorrows, spared From that which might have been our doom. GRACE INGERSOLL. The attribution of this poem is uncertain. Where God placeth any creature, Where he planteth any seed, Each may find what best will answer True development and need. There are blossoms on the mountains, Braving even Alpine snow, That would perish if transplanted To the valleys down below. On our northern hills are roses, Never fearing winter's breath, That the kisses of the south-wind Would but wither into death. True, the plant awhile may flourish, Forced some foreign bower to grace, But its root would strike down deeper In its native soil and place. Shut out from the earth's green places, Is the wild bird's music best? Does its voice not sound the sweetest Singing nearest to its nest? And thou wert like bird or blossom, Daughter of a northern raceâ Thou couldst neither sing nor florish, Taken from thy native place. Going straight to woman's duties, From thy childish joys and sports, From the free air of the mountains, To the atmosphere of courts, Can we marvel if the footstep, Which trod lightly on the plain, Should be hindered in its movement By the drapery of the train? Can we marvel, when we see her Borne from home and friends away, If her voice went out in silence, And her beauty to decay? No, we marvel not, yet mourn thee, Lying in thy foreign tomb, Fairest flower of all New England, This should not have been thy doom! MADAME REGNAULT. The attribution of this poem is uncertain. I think the humblest peasant girl, Roaming the valleys free, If loved and cherished in her home, Could never envy thee; But rather weep above thy fateâ So proud, and yet so desolate. Midst all the ladies of the court Still wert thou most forlorn, E'en for thy very beauty's sake A target for their scorn; Envy, and bitter rivalry, Drove from their hearts all love for thee. And e'en the Monarch, whom through life Thou didst revere and trust, He, to thy worth and loveliness, Was cruel and unjust; O'er him, the noblest woman's power Could last but for an idle hour. The weak were objects of his scorn, The wise, his fear and dread; He heaped with shame, from mere caprice, The unoffending head. And they who dared to brave his wrath Were swept unpitied from his path. Though hopes, or even hearts must break, He ruled unthwarted still, Friends, sisters, even his wife at last, He sacrificed at will; Was retribution for the past That none were near him at the last? O woe! to thee, fair lady, woe, That such fidelity As thine was poured on one who gave So little back to thee; Woe, that thou shouldst have bowed thy head For shame, thou hadst not merited. And woe, for him who faltered not For woman's suffering; Must there not come to him at last A fearful reckoning? When all who suffered for his sake Are heard, what answer can he make? M'LLE GEORGES. The attribution of this poem is uncertain. Pleasant hopes at life's bright sunrise, Courage for its noonday toil, And calm quiet at its sunset, Hushing all the long turmoil. These the blessings which our Father Sends us in our earthly homeâ Making kind and good provision For all seasons as they comeâ Giving strength for the performance Of each duty which life bringsâ Giving faith, whereby securely We take hold on heavenly things, And each day that we are marking, By good thought, or better deed, Makes its own best preparation For the day that shall succeed. Nothing that is good can perish, Hope, or virtue, love, or truth; If we rightly live the present, We shall not regret our youth. For if we are only adding Truest wisdom to our store, Every day we live is better Than the day that went before. Child of genius, wit, and beauty, Bright thy day at morning rose; Hast thou gained no hope or memory That can beautify its close? Ah! life's vanities and follies Made thy pleasures in the pastâ And vain effort to recall them Is thy solace at the last. Better hadst thou spent in duty Years but wasted for renown, Then thy white hairs should adorn thee And their glory be thy crown!</field>
