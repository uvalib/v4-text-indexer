      <field name="fulltext">TO MY FRIEND, ON HIS BIRTHDAY. Oh, Time! deal gently with my friend, Who gently deals with all; And on his loved and honored head Let blessings only fall In love to God, and love to man, His days pass here below; And so, to reach the home above, He has not far to go. But distant be that hapless day That calls him from our view: Heaven has so many souls like his, And Earth, alas! so few TO MY FRIEND, ON HIS BIRTHDAY. He who has walked among his fellow-men This life's rough path for threescore years and ten, Bearing for others, on the weary way, The heat and burden of the toilsome day; Sounding the silvery notes of faith and hope Whene'er the weak or the despairing droop; Speaking the words of sympathy and love, Far the wild discords of the world above; Raising the fallen, succoring the opprest— The Holy Graal of unfound good his quest; Holding aloft, a true and blameless Knight, The stainless banner of the Just and Right: He is the Christian hero of to-day, And at his feet my tribute here I lay. CHARITY. O Thou who once on earth beneath the weight Of our mortality didst live and move, The incarnation of profoundest love; Who on the Cross that love didst consummate, Whose deep and ample fullness could embrace The poorest, meanest of our fallen race: How shall we e'er that boundless debt repay? By long, loud prayers in gorgeous temples said? By rich oblations on thine altars laid? Ah, no! not thus Thou didst appoint the way: When Thou wast bowed our human woe beneath, Then as a legacy Thou didst bequeath Earth's sorrowing children to our ministry, Saying, As ye do to them ye do to me. UNTIL DEATH. Make me no vows of constancy, dear friend, To love me, though I die, thy whole life long, And love no other till thy days shall end; Nay, it were rash and wrong. If thou canst love another, be it so; I would not reach out of my quiet grave To bind thy heart, if it should choose to go: Love should not be a slave. My placid ghost, I trust, will walk serene In clearer light than gilds these earthly morns, Above the jealousies and envies keen Which sow this life with thorns. Thou wouldst not feel my shadowy caress, If after death my soul should linger here; Men's hearts crave tangible, close tenderness, Love's presence, warm and near. It would not make me sleep more peacefully That thou wert wasting all thy life in woe For my poor sake; what love thou hast for me Bestow it ere I go. Carve not upon a stone when I am dead The praises which remorseful mourners give To women's graces,—a tardy recompense,— But speak thou while I live. Heap not the heavy marble on my head To shut away the sunshine and the dew; Let small blooms grow there and let grasses wave, And raindrops filter through. Thou wilt meet many fairer and more gay Than I; but, trust me, thou canst never find One who will love and serve thee night and day With a more single mind. Forget me when I die!—the violets Above my rest will blossom just as blue, Nor miss thy tears: e'en Nature's self forgets;— But while I live, be true! AB ASTRIS. I saw the stars swept through ethereal space, Stars, suns, and systems in infinity,— Our earth an atom in the shoreless sea, Where each had its appointed path and place: And I was lost in my own nothingness. But then I said, Dost thou not know that He Who guides these orbs through trackless space guides thee? No longer groveling thus, thyself abase, For in this vast, harmonious, perfect whole, In infinite progression moving on, Thou hast thy place, immortal human soul, Thy place and part not less than star and sun; Then with this grand procession fall in line, This rhythmic march led on by power divine. ACCORDANCE. He who with bold and skilful hand sweeps o'er The organ-keys of some cathedral pile, Flooding with music, vault, and nave, and aisle, Though on his ear falls but a thunderous roar. In the composer's lofty motive free, Knows well that all that temple, vast and dim, Thrills to its base with anthem, psalm, and hymn, True to the changeless laws of harmony. So he who on these clanging chords of life, With firm, sweet touch plays the Great Master's score, Of truth, and love, and duty, evermore, Knows, too, that far beyond this roar and strife, Though he may never hear, in the true time, These notes must all accord in symphonies sublime. A SUMMER IDYL. The city is dreary and dusty and lone, The Smiths and the Joneses and Jenkinses gone; The doors are all barred, and the shutters all down, And nobody left in this desolate town— Save the sweeper who wearily loiters and lags, The ashman, and he who cries “Bottles and rags!” And a hurrying crowd one knows nothing about, Though each one of them somebody cares for, no doubt; The streets everywhere are plowed into a rut, For putting down pipes that never stay put. Gazing up from my window above may be scanned A strip of the sky as wide as my hand; And then, looking earthward, may dimly be seen At least a square yard once of emerald green; But now from the heat and sewer-gas, behold! It has taken the favorite hue of old gold. Then the odors,—not Milton's Sabean, I own, Nor yet those that Coleridge found at Cologne, But here to our trained, tried olfactories known, As the Hunter's Point perfume—from boiling old bone. You boast of your singing birds lodged in the trees, Of the dash of the waves, the sigh of the breeze, The lowing of herds, the hum of the bees— Sweet voices of Nature,—but what are all these To our lively mosquitos' appeal to the senses, The wail of the cats as they stray o'er the fences; Till a friend at my side, in a rage going on, Makes use of “cuss words” and calls for his gun. And here comes the organ that stops at our door, To grind out its music that makes, with the roar Of the wagons and carts as they rumble and jolt O'er the roughly paved streets, a prolonged thunderbolt; And every two minutes the up-in-air train Goes whirring along like a demon insane; Till all thought is dispersed, like a mist in the air, And silence is golden, we meekly declare. Then the heat that no thoughts of the blizzard assuage, When Phœbus and Fahrenheit start a rampage; And when “General Humidity” joins in the tilt, Like plucked flowers of the field the poor mortal must wilt, Till he cries, like the wit, in disconsolate tones, To take off his flesh and sit in his bones. But, however, to sum up and make myself clear, For July and August I would not be here; But give me New-York for nine months of the year,— With all its shortcomings there 's no place so dear; With its life and its rush, what it does and has done, There is no city like it under the sun. LARGESS. Go forth in life, O friend, not seeking love; A mendicant that with imploring eye And outstretched hand asks of the passers-by The alms his strong necessities may move. For such poor love, to pity near allied, Thy generous spirit should not stoop and wait, A suppliant, whose prayer may be denied, Like a spurned beggar's at a palace gate! But thy heart's affluence lavish, uncontrolled, The largess of thy love give full and free, As monarchs in their progress scatter gold. And be thy heart like the exhaustless sea, That must its wealth of cloud and dew bestow, Though tributary streams or ebb or flow. INDIAN SUMMER O sweet, sad autumn of the waning year, Though in thy bowers the roses all lie dead, And from thy woods the song of birds has fled, And winter, stern and cold, is hovering near; Yet from thy presence breathes a holy calm. The fervid heats, the lightning storms, all past, A tender light o'er earth and sky is cast, And all thy solemn voices chant a psalm. Oh, Indian Summer, autumn of the soul, That no returning Spring shall visit more, Though all thy rose-hued morning dreams are o'er, And phantoms dread stand threat'ning at the goal, Yet are these days dear as e'en Summer knew; These Sibylline leaves of life, so precious, since so few. TO THE UNKNOWN BUILDER OF THE CATHEDRAL OF COLOGNE Unknown great Master! whose creative thought Is here inscribed, though from Fame's shining scroll Thy name is lost, this wondrous dome is fraught With the expression of thy reverent soul. Immortal, in each curve and line inwrought; As in the vast, harmonious, perfect whole: We see buttress, tower, and pinnacle that reach In forests of great columns, towering high, With deep grooved arches interlacing each, Lift their bold outlines dark against the sky. It rises like a vision in mid-air, indeed A temple meet for a divine abode; The embodied symbol of man's highest creed; A symphony in stone; a thought of God. TO CAPTAIN WEST, OF THE STEAMER ATLANTIC The gathering clouds around us lower, The tempest wildly raves, But fearlessly our noble ship The angry ocean braves, And buoyant as a sea-bird rides The crested mountain waves. The gale, the storm, the night may come, No fear disturbs the breast; Our ship is strong,—our Captain brave,— And we securely rest. Long life to him and all his Line! Health to the gallant West! Pilgrims to many lands are we, And now our travel o'er Once more beneath the Stars and Stripes We near our native shore; And since we parted from it last Who does not love it more? Adieu, new friends and old, adieu! May every wandering breeze That meets you on the Voyage of Life Be far less rude than these That our good ship has met so well Upon the wintry seas. LINES TO ? I thank thee—not for that kind deed alone, Though deep within my heart the record lies, Engraved with those few pleasant memories, That like stray sunbeams on my life have shone: I thank thee most for this—that when belief In human worth was darkening into doubt,— As one by one, I marked with bitter grief Those I had reverenced with a faith devout Turn recreant back upon their heavenward way And sink before me into common clay; That thou dost come my faith to reassure, My wavering trust in goodness to restore, And bid my fainting hope take wing once more. SPRINGTIME Over the valleys and over the mountains, Borne on the wings of the south wind I come; Breaking the ice-chains, unloosing the fountains, Waking all Nature to beauty and bloom. Flowers from the green turf in myriads are springing; Zephyrs are faint with the perfume they bear; While the voices of Earth, Air, and Ocean are singing, Hail to the springtime! the youth of the year! Oh, gather my rosebuds and sport in my bowers, Children of Earth, while my footsteps I stay. Wreathe with your garlands my vanishing hours, Which like life's sunny springtime are passing away. TO GEORGE PEABODY No Eastern tale, no annals of the past, Of Greece or Rome, deeds such as thine relate, Deeds kings and emperors might emulate, That o'er thy native land new luster cast; The land that opens all her wide domain To the oppressed of every name and zone, And with a spirit generous as thine own, Pours forth the gifts her boundless stores contain; The land that shall embalm thy memory In love and honor, while long ages hence The bounteous stream of thy beneficence, Bearing along to millions yet to be Tributes of light and love, its course shall run, Still widening as it flows, like the broad Amazon! TO LAMARTINE A poet led me once, in chains of flowers, A pilgrimage beneath the Orient skies; And there I dreamed I walked in Eden's bowers, And breathed the odorous airs of Paradise. He touched his harp, and when he sang of Love, Then all my heart was to the poet given; For his sweet tones seemed echoes from above;— Strains that breathed less of Earth than Heaven. But when in majesty I saw him stand The sacred shrine of Liberty to guard; The destinies of France within his hand,— Then in the hero I forgot the bard. Poet and hero, thus alternately, Would claim my homage, each with equal art. Allegiance I to neither could deny, So each by turns shared my divided heart. TO FITZ-GREENE HALLECK I see the sons of genius rise The nobles of our land, And foremost in the gathering ranks I see the poet-band. That priesthood of the Beautiful To whom alone 't is given To lift our spirits from the dust, Back to their native heaven. But there is one among the throng Not passed his manhood's prime, The laurel-wreath upon his brow Has greener grown with time; And in his eye yet glows the light Of the celestial fire, But cast beside him on the earth Is his neglected lyre. The lyre whose high heroic notes A thousand hearts have stirred Lies mute—the skilful hand no more Awakes one slumbering chord. O poet, rouse thee from thy dreams! Wake from the voiceless slumbers, And once again give to the breeze The music of thy numbers. Sing! for our country claims her bards, She listens for thy strains; Sing! for upon our jarring earth Too much of discord reigns. TO PETER COOPER The Pyramids of Egypt, even to-day The wonder of the world, stupendous stand In their material greatness, and defy Alike relentless Time and Libyan sand. But what great thought through those grim structures smiles? What Aspiration reared those wondrous piles? None,—save that kings, forgotten long ago, Might leave their worthless dust to waste below. This Shrine thou 'st reared to Science and to Art A nobler Thought than Egypt dreamed contains, And every stone speaks of a regal heart Benignant as the Nile to desert plains, When all the arid waste it overflows, And the parched shores grow green, and blossom as the rose. TO CHARLES BUTLER Thus, one by one, dear friend, the years flow by, That bear us onward to the silent land. And one by one, around us falling lie, The loved ones we have walked with, hand in hand. And thus, the hour comes swiftly, surely on; I see its shadow darkly toward us creep, When one shall go, and one be left alone, To bear life's chain, alone to wait and weep. How sad, how dark, did not the heavenly stars, Twin stars of Faith, and Hope, rise on our way, To shed their luster through our prison-bars, To light our path on to eternal day! That day that knows no cloud, no change, no night, Where tears, and pain, and sorrow, enter never, Where the beloved on earth again unite, Where one in God, they part no more forever. TO THE SAME Thy patron, good St. Valentine, Who lived so long ago, Watched only over happy hearts, As all true lovers know. But thou, born on his natal day, A truer saint I find; While he alone the happy loved, Thou lovest all thy kind. Through all the sorrows, woes, and ills of life, That cloud our earthly road, Serene through discord, danger, storm, and strife, Thou seem'st to walk with God. And so thy gracious presence ever sheds A light as from above— A light that all thy being overspreads With Faith, and Hope, and Love. LIBERTY TO IRELAND A nation's birthday breaks in glory; Songs from her hills and valleys rise, And myriad hearts thrill to the story Of Freedom's wars and victories. When God's right arm alone was o'er her, And in his name the patriot band, With sacred blood baptized the land, And England's Lion crouched before her, Sons of the Emerald Isle! She bids you rend the chain, And tell the haughty ocean queen Ye, too, are free-born men. Long had the world looked on in sorrow As Erin's sunburst set in night. Joy, joy! there breaks a glorious morrow; Behold a beam of morning light! A ray of hope, her night redeeming! And she greets it, though there lower England's scaffold, England's tower; And though hireling swords are gleaming, Wild shouts on every breeze Come swelling o'er the sea: Hark! 't is her starving millions' cry: “Give Ireland Liberty!” TO EMMA I look within those deep, dark, lustrous eyes, And there I read thy heart's sweet mysteries; There, like those lakes that mirror earth and sky, The lights and shadows of the future lie. For thee ambition has no clarion call; Thou 'lt seek no home in court, or princely hall, Where folly reigns, and the world's votaries throng To wile the hours with mirth, and dance, and song. Nor wilt thou seek to blazon high thy name, As woman may, upon the scroll of Fame. But there 's an empire o'er which thou wouldst reign, Yet should thy subjects wear no despot's chain. It is the empire of the Heart. It shall be thine, And o'er it thou shalt reign by “right divine.” TO ANNA For thee, the Sibyl in the future sees A lovely cottage hidden by the trees;— Round its white porch are trained the clustering vines; Beneath its roof perpetual summer shines— The heart's sweet summer that shall take its dyes From the clear sunshine of thine azure eyes. The nightingale shall sing thee to thy dreams; The lark shall wake thee with morn's earliest beams; The flocks and herds shall own thy gentle care; All living things thy kind regard shall share. And as thou wanderest midst the lovely scene, The flowers shall claim thee for their fairy queen. And here, where Nature wears her loveliest spell, Shalt thou, her fairest work, serenely dwell; Far from the world's “ignoble strife” and care, With some loved spirit “for thy minister,” Thy life like some fair stream shall glide away, And thou shalt sleep, to wake in the Eternal Day. TO NETTIE Now has the spring her treasures all unbound, The earth has put her wedding-garment on, And, robed in light, with flowers and verdure crowned, Comes forth in joy to meet the bridegroom sun. Thou, too, in thy young life's first bloom and pride, Joyous as spring, fresh as the morning air, Fair as the flowers of May, comest forth a bride, And bowest thy head, Love's golden chain to wear. Were mine the power, thy course of life should be Serene and tranquil as the summer sky. No wintry blast should rudely visit thee, No tear of sorrow ever dim thine eye. And when that hour should come, as come it must, And thy long summer day draw to its close, Filled with immortal hope and heavenly trust Thou like the sun shouldst sink to thy repose. Vain wish, for cloudless skies, life without tears! A wiser, higher power controls thy fate. Sorrow and joy are each his ministers; And each alike on human footsteps wait. Seek then his aid who was a man of grief, Who bore the cross and won a crown for thee, And thou shalt walk the troubled sea of life, As once he walked the Sea of Galilee. ON RECEIVING A PICTURE OF AN ITALIAN COUNTESS Oh lovely semblance of a lovelier face! Upon thy classic contour as I gaze, My eager thought flies through dividing space; And to the living picture tribute pays. I see that brow with thought and goodness crowned, I see those eyes with deep affection shine; I hear the language from those sweet lips sound, By poets made immortal and divine. I would that I might follow my free thought, And see this gentle stranger face to face; For such fair spirits I have ever sought, And such would ever hold in my embrace. TO JULIETTE ON HER WEDDING-DAY When our first parents were from Eden driven To wander exiled in this world of care, Hope changed to fear, and memory to despair; But once, to their posterity 't is given The vision of that blissful home to share: Whene'er two wedded souls as one are bound, Then the lost Paradise again is found; But trifles light as air this dream dispel, And drive the hapless mortals forth disowned, In the cold air of common life to dwell. To-day for thee, these dreamland gates are riven; Enter, and in its charmèd precincts stay Till thy sweet life at last shall pass away, And thou shalt find it is not far to Heaven. TO JULIETTE'S TWINS Dear Catherine, and David too, How very sweet it was of you To telegraph that you were here, New-lighted on this lower sphere. That though unlooked for, both had come, To bring into the earthly home The light and joy of Paradise That shine from your four infant eyes. Your excellent and learned papa, Your beautiful and sweet mama, Must be most charmed to call you theirs; Although you bring new fears and cares. Perhaps at night you'll cry and roar, And they must wake, and walk the floor. You'll have the measles and the mumps, The whooping-cough, the rash, the dumps. And all those things, so troublesome, That mortal children suffer from. Dear little pilgrims, just begun In this wide world life's race to run Upon life's rough and thorny road, Fresh from the fashioning hand of God; Speed on the course, and win the prize, The prize most worthy in his eyes. TO MISS EDITH M. THOMAS Your Pegasus, Edith, is hitched to a star, While mine drags along a Sixth Avenue car; Yours bears you away to the far empyrean, Mine carries me down through the quarters plebeian. Now, soaring aloft, you stop at Antares, Call it home, that 's the place for Penates and Lares; Or back to old Greece with her heroes and gods, You get up a flirtation in sonnets and odes. (Though they hailed from Olympus, that classical spot, These “old parties,” confess, were a pretty bad lot.) Then with dear Mother Nature you make very free To fathom her secrets of bird, flower, and tree; To live with her ever on intimate terms, A freedom on your part, she always confirms, Although so exclusive she is with the rest of us, Never giving her password or key to the best of us. But you have them both, and can seek at your pleasure Her most secret haunts, her most precious treasure; And she calls you in accents as winning and mild, As some fond old grandmother calls a pet child. The round of my Pegasus lies through the town; He travels and travels, now up, and now down; I pull on the strap, and he willingly stops, And leaves me to visit the markets and shops. (My car, you perceive, is the bobtail variety So little admired by the press and society.) But wherever we go he signally fails To lift me above the street levels and rails. So you see that our steeds are not matched for a race, And with all best endeavors can never keep pace. THE BRIDES OF INDRA Lo, 'tis Indra! he who kindles, God of celestial fire; Who lights the thoughts of man with the flame of wild desire. Have you watched the changeful sky, crimson, amethyst, and gold? 'T is his mantle, and the stars shine from every beaming fold. He rides the snow-white elephant, lashed from the pale sea-foam. From his hand the rushing thunderbolt, the arrowy lightning come. Have you heard the shrieking east-wind when the trees were rent and strown, And the white salt dust of the sea in the face of heaven was blown? It is the wrath of Indra; and the sunlight is his smile. When the clouds expire in raindrops, then Indra weeps the while. In his beauty, none like him the earth or heaven have had: With the wistful passion of a man, and the splendor of a god, He has thrilled the earth's dark places, a supernal flash of fire, He has sounded all the depths of guilt, and sorrow, and desire. Now sinking in the struggle, now exalted soaring high, The dark, wild heart of man strives with his divinity, God of sunlight, God of storm, still the world his voice obeys, And the sea of human passion, his mighty power still sways, On its threshold, looking out on the changing world of life, With its movement and its crowd, its uproar and its strife, Stood a group of lovely maidens, charmed and dazzled by the glare. The gaze of Indra fell upon them, and beholding them so fair He loved them. Flashing earthward in a form of fire he came, Kissed their lips, and then he left them, with blanched cheeks, and eyes aflame. And they knew a god thus thrilled them; and had sought his home again Ere they tasted aught of love, save its first and sudden pain. Then they, with vague desire, in their innocence went forth; Seeking what, or whom, they knew not, they wandered o'er the earth; And Love, who only breathes in the clearer, upper air, Led them to the hilly land, where the stars were shining near. And there, though far beyond them, looking down from cloudless skies, They saw the great god Indra, with outstretched arms and passionate eyes. Then their hearts sank faint within them; fain was each one to turn back. But the soul within had found its wings, and bore them rushing o'er the track, In a superhuman ecstasy, along the dizzy space, Till the arms of Indra clasped them in the fire of his embrace. All unconscious of the bitter cost to those to whom 't is given Thus to awaken the desire of the ardent sun of heaven, With quivering lips and beating hearts was the sacrifice achieved, And the sorrowful great gift—the love of Indra—they received. Bear me witness, O ye mortals, by the kiss of fire refined, How closely do the rapture and the anguish intertwine! I know not which is greatest, for the bliss and suffering strain— Strain alike, and all too fiercely, on the human heart and brain. Yet who would cage his soul, when the mighty sun-god came To thrill his being through, to draw his spirit forth in flame? But the maidens, knowing naught of an Immortal's love, Against the crown that Indra laid upon them, wildly, vainly strove; Though it wrapped them in a glory, their young brows it scorched and tore, And its golden hues the life-blood of the wearers crimsoned o'er. “We are faint,” they cried, “and weary; from our cheeks the blood has fled; Our eyes are tired with beauty; in our souls the youth is dead; The light is but a splendid pain; and, drooping, worn, and rent With this eternal rapture, our weary hearts are spent; We turn away in anguish, exhausted and oppressed. From this fever of our lives, give us rest, give us rest.” They mourned thus until, at length, by resistless impulse led, From the mountain of Méru, the brides of Indra fled; Fled and sought those shadowy valleys where the stream of time flows by Only measured by the seasons; and the mortal dwellers die Of the slowly creeping years—not of sin, or shame, or wrong; Not because they have lived too much, but because they 've lived too long. Oh, what a pleasant land was that! Surely there might peace be found. A sweet slumberous repose softly lay on all around. No extreme of heat or cold, excess of light or depth of gloom, Ever broke the wondrous calm of that wilderness of bloom. And the hearts of those that dwelt there, emotion ne'er could move, Or wake the slumbering ecstasies of hate, despair, or love. Ever young and ever lovely were the women of that land, And the men who ruled its councils were both courteous and bland. No labor there was needed, no hardened hand of toil, For all the heart could ask for sprang spontaneous from the soil. Old age, disease, and poverty, and suffering could not stay, For a dark and terrible river ever hurried them away, As it poured its troubled waters through the shining land of gold, Washing all its peaceful borders, muttering fiercely, as it rolled, Words of menace and despair through its sinister black flood, Which the smiling people on its banks heard, but never understood. Wretched, flying, worn, and weary, to this luxurious land Hither came these hapless wanderers, the fugitive fair band. Their strange beauty and their wanness, born of passions here unknown To the passionless who dwelt here, touched their hearts and they were won— Touched their hearts with sweet compassion for each lovely fugitive, And they cried, “Oh, stay here with us; we'll share with you, while we live.” Now pale, and with lustrous eyes, wandering daily side by side, The once beloved of Indra in loneliness abide; No friendly voices greet them as, dejected and apart, They pass the idle throng, slow of step and sad at heart. Each morning wakes anew a gnawing, fierce desire, That the evening, in despair and in misery, sees expire; And a curse pursues them ever like an avenging ghost— The curse that haunts and maddens, of a glory won and lost. VIVA ITALIA! Italia, in thy bleeding heart I thought e'en hope was dead; That from thy scarred and prostrate form The spark of life had fled. I thought, as memory's sunset glow Its radiance o'er thee cast, That all thy glory and thy fame Were buried in the past. Twice Mistress of the world, I thought Thy star had set in gloom; That all thy shrines and monuments Were but thy spirit's tomb— The mausoleum of the world, Where Art her spoils might keep; Where pilgrims from all shrines might come, To wonder and to weep. But from thy deathlike slumber now, In joy I see thee wake And over thy long shrouded sky Behold the morning break. Along the Alps and Apennines Runs an electric thrill; A golden splendor lights once more Each storied vale and hill. And hopes, bright as thy sunny skies, Are o'er thy future cast; The future that upon thee beams, As glorious as thy past.</field>
