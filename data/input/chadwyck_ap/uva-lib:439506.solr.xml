      <field name="fulltext">Volume I LYRICS AND OLD WORLD IDYLLS [BLOOMS OF THE BERRY] [Wine-warm winds that sigh and sing] Wine-warm winds that sigh and sing Led me, wrapped in many moods, Through the green, sonorous woods Of belated spring. Till I came where, glad with heat, Waste and wild the fields were strewn, Olden as the olden moon, At my weary feet. Wild and white with starry bloom, One far milky-way that dashed, When some mad wind down it flashed, Into billowy foam. I, bewildered, gazed around, As one on whose heavy dreams Comes a sudden burst of beams, Like a mighty sound. . . . . If the grander flowers I sought, But these berry-blooms to you, Evanescent as the dew, Only these I brought. THE WOOD GOD I What deity for dozing Laziness Devised the lounging leafiness of this Secluded nook?âAnd how!âdid I distress His musing ease that fled but now? or his Communion with some forest-sister, fair And shy as is the whippoorwill-flower there, Did I disturb?âStill is the wild moss warm And fragrant with late pressure,âas the palm Of some hot Hamadryad, who, a-nap, Props her hale cheek upon it, while her arm Is wildflower-buried; in her hair the balm Of a whole spring of blossoms and of sap.â II See, how the dented moss, that pads the hump Of these distorted roots, elastic springs From that god's late reclining! Lump by lump Its points, impressed, rise in resilient rings, As stars crowd, qualming through gray evening skies.â Invisible presence, still I feel thy eyes Regarding me, bringing dim dreams before My half-closed gaze, here where great, green-veined leaves Reach, waving at me, their innumerable hands, Stretched towards this water where the sycamore Stands burly guard; where every ripple weaves A ceaseless, wavy quivering as of bands III Of elfin chivalry, that, helmed with gold, Invisible march, making a twinkling sound.â What brought thee here?âthis wind, that steals the old Gray legends from the forests and around Whispers them now? Or, in those purple weeds The hermit brook so busy with his beads?â Lulling the silence with his prayers all day, Droning soft Aves on his rosary Of bubbles.âOr, that butterfly didst mark On yon hag-taper, towering by the way, A witch's yellow torch?âOr didst, like me, Watch, drifting by, these curled, brown bits of bark? IV Or con the slender gold of this dim, still Unmoving minnow 'neath these twisted roots, Thrust o'er the smoky topaz of this rill?â Or, in this sunlight, did those insect flutes, Sleepy with summer, drowsily forlorn, Remind thee of Tithonos and the Morn? Until thine eyes dropped dew, the dimpled stream Crinkling with crystal o'er the winking grail?â Or didst perplex thee with some poet plan To drug this air with beauty to make dream,â Presence unseen, still watching in yon vale!â Me, wildwood-wandered from the haunts of man! LOVELINESS I Now let us forth to find the young witch Spring, Seated amid her bow'rs and birds and buds, Busy with loveliness.âAnd, wandering Among old forests that the sunlight floods, Or vales of hermit-holy solitudes, Dryads shall beckon us from where they cling, Their limbs an oak-bark brown; their hairâwild woods Have perfumedâwreathed with earliest leaves: and they, Regarding us with a dew-sparkling eye, Shall whispering greet us, as the rain the rye, Or from wild lips melodious welcome fling, Like hidden waterfalls with winds at play. II Let us surprise the Naiad ere she slipsâ Nude at her toiletteâin her fountain's glass; With damp locks dewy and evasive hips, Cool-dripping, but an instant seen, alas! When from indented moss and plushy grassâ Fear in her great eyes' rainbow-blueâshe dips, Irised, the cloven water; as we pass Making a rippled circle that shall hide, From our exploring eyes, what watery path She gleaming took; what crystal haunt she hath In minnowy freshness, where her murmurous lips, Bubbling, make merry 'neath the rocky tide. III Then we may meet the Oread, whose eyes Are dewdrops where twin heavens shine confessed: She, all the maiden modesty's surprise Rosying her temples,âto slim loins and breast Tempestuous, brown, bewildering tresses pressed,â Shall stand a moment's moiety in wise Of some delicious dream, then shrink, distressed, Like some wild mist that, hardly seen, is gone, Footing the ferny hillside without sound; Or, like storm sunlight, her white limbs shall bound, A thistle's instant, towards a woody rise, A flying glimmer o'er the dew-drenched lawn. IV And we may see the Satyrs in the shades Of drowsy dells pipe, and, goat-footed, dance; And Pan himself reel rollicking through the glades; Or, hidden in bosky bow'rs, the Lust, perchance, Faun-like, that waits with heated, animal glance The advent of the Loveliness that wades Thigh-deep through flowers, naked as Romance, All unsuspecting, till two hairy arms Clasp her rebellious beauty, panting white, Whose tearful terror, struggling into might, Beats the brute brow resisting, but evades Not him, for whom the gods designed her charms. WAITING Were it but May now, while our hearts are yearning, How they would bound and smile, The young blood burning! Around the tedious dial No slow hands turning. Were it but May now!âsay, What joy to go, Your hand in mine all day, Where blossoms blow! Your hand, more white than May, May's flowers of snow. Were it but May now!âthink, What wealth she has! The bluet and wild-pink, Wild flowers,âthat mass About the wood-brook's brink,â And sassafras. Nights, that the large stars strew, Heaven on heaven rolled; Nights, pearled with stars and dew, Whose heavens hold Aromas, and the new Moon's curve of gold. So mad, so wild is March!â I long, oh, long To see the redbud's torch Flame far and strong; Hear, on my vine-climbed porch, The bluebird's song. How slow the Hours creep, Each with a crutch!â Ah, could my spirit leap Its bounds and touch That day, no thing would keepâ Or matter much! But now, with you away, Time halts and crawls, Feet clogged with winter clay, That never falls, While, distant still, that day Of meeting calls. LONGINGS Now when the first wild violets peer All rain-filled at blue April skies, As on one smiles one's sweetheart dear With the big teardrops in her eyes: Now when the May-apples, I wis, Bloom white along lone, greenwood creeks, As bashful as the cheeks you kiss, As waxen as your sweetheart's cheeks: Within the soul what longings rise To stamp the town-dust from the feet! Fare forth to gaze in Spring's clean eyes, And kiss her cheeks so cool and sweet! THE SWEET O' THE YEAR I How can I help from laughing, while The daffodillies at me smile? The dancing dew winks tipsily In clusters of the lilac-tree, And crocus' mouths and hyacinths' Storm through the grassy labyrinths A mirth of pearl and violet; While roses, bud by bud, Laugh from each dainty-lacing net Red lips of maidenhood. II How can I help from singing when The swallow and the hawk again Are noisy in the hyaline Of happy heavens, clear as wine? The robin, lustily and shrill, Pipes on the timber-belted hill; And o'er the fallow skim the bold, Mad orioles that glow Like shining shafts of ingot gold Shot from the morning's bow. III How can I help from loving, dear, Since love is of the sweetened year?â The very insects feel his power, And chirr and chirrup hour on hour; The bee and beetle in the noon, The cricket underneath the moon:â What else to do but follow too, Since youth is on the wing, Lord Life who follows through the dew Lord Love a-carolling. IN MIDDLE SPRING Now the fields are rolled into turbulent gold, And a ripple of fire and pearl is blent With the emerald surges of wood and of wold, A flower-foam bursting redolent: Now the dingles and deeps of the woodland old Are glad with a sibilant life new sent, Too rare to be told are the manifold, Sweet fancies that quicken, eloquent, In the heart that no longer is cold. How it knows of the wings of the hawk ere it swings From the drippled dew scintillant seen! Where the redbird hides, ere it flies or sings, In melodious quiverings of green! How the sun to the dogwood such kisses brings That it laughs into blossoms of wonderful sheen; While the wind, to the strings of his lute that rings, Makes love to apple and nectarine, Till the sap in them rosily springs. Go seek in the ray for a sworded fay, The chestnut's buds into blooms that rips; And look in the brook, that runs laughing gay, For the Nymph with the laughing lips; In the brake for the Dryad whose eyes are gray, From whose bosom the perfume drips; The Faun hid away, where the branches sway, Thick ivy low down on his hips, Pursed lips on a syrinx at play. So, ho! for the rose, the Romeo rose, And the lyric it hides in its heart! And, oh, for the epic the oak-tree knows, Sonorous as Homer in art! And it's ho! for the prose of the weed that grows Green-writing Earth's commonest part!â What God may propose let us learn of those, The songs and the dreams that start In the heart of each blossom that blows. A SPRING SHOWER We stood where the fields were beryl, The redolent woodland was warm; And the heaven above us, now sterile, Was alive with the pulse-winds of storm. We had watched the green wheat brighten And gloom as it winced at each gust; And the turbulent maples whiten As the lane blew gray with dust. White flakes from the blossoming cherry, Pink snows of the peaches were blown, And star-bloom wrecks of the berry And dogwood petals were sown. Then instantly heaven was sullied, And earth was thrilled with alarm, As a cloud, that the thunder had gullied, Thrust over the sunlight its arm. The birds to dry coverts had hurried, And hid in their leafy-built rooms; And the bees and the hornets had buried Themselves in the bells of the blooms. Then down from the clouds, as from towers, Rode slant the tall lancers of rain, And charged the fair troops of the flowers, And trampled the grass of the plain. And the armies of blossoms were scattered; Their standards hung draggled and lank; And the rose and the lily were shattered, And the iris lay crushed on its bank. But high in the storm was the swallow, And the rock-loud voice of the fall, From its ramparts of forest, rang hollow Defiance and challenge o'er all. But the storm and its clouds passed over, And left but one cloud in the west, Wet wafts that were fragrant with clover, And the sun slow-sinking to rest. Rain-drippings and rain in the poppies, And scents as of honey and bees; A touch of wild light on the coppice, That turned into flames the drenched trees. Then the cloud in the sunset was riven, And bubbled and rippled with gold, And over the gorges of heaven, Like a gonfalon vast was unrolled. HEPATICAS In the frail hepaticasâ That the early Springtide tossed, Sapphire-like, along the ways Of the woodlands that she crossedâ I behold, with other eyes, Footprints of a dream that flies. One who leads me; whom I seek: In whose loveliness there is All the glamour that the Greek Knew as wind-borne Artemis.â I am mortal. Woe is me! Her sweet immortality! Spirit, must I always fare, Following thy averted looks? Now thy white arm, now thy hair, Glimpsed among the trees and brooks? Thou who hauntest, whispering, All the slopes and vales of Spring. Cease to lure! or grant to me All thy beauty! though it pain, Slay with splendor utterly! Flash revealment on my brain! And one moment let me see All thy immortality! SPIRITS OF SPRING I Over the summer seas, From the Hesperides, Warm as the southern breeze, Gather the Spirits, Clad on with sun and rain, Fire in each ardent vein, Who, with a wild refrain, Waken the germs that the Season inherits. II See, where they come, like mist, Gleaming with amethyst, Trailing the light that kissed Vine-tangled mountains Looming o'er tropic lakes, Where every wind, that shakes Tamarisk coverts, makes Music that haunts like the falling of fountains. III You may behold the beat Of their wild hearts of heat, And their rose-flashing feet Flying before us: Hear them among the trees Whispering like far-off seas, Waking the drowsy bees, Wild-birds and flowers and torrents sonorous. IV You may behold their eyes, Star-like, that sapphire dyes, To which the blossoms rise Star-like; and shadows Flee from: and, golden deep, As through the woods they sweep, See their wild curls that keep Asphodel memories that kindle the meadows. V Music of forest-streams, Fragrance and dewy gleams, Daybreak and dawn and dreams, High things and lowly, Mix in their limbs of light, Which, what they touch of blight, Quicken to blossom white, Raise to be beautiful, perfect, and holy. VI Come! do not sit and wait Now that once desolate Fields are intoxicate With birds and flowers! And all the woods are rife With resurrected life, Passion and purple strife Of the warm winds and the turbulent showers. VII Come! let us lie and dream Here by the wildwood stream, Where many a twinkling gleam Falls on the rooty Banks; and the forest glooms Rain down their redbud blooms, Armfuls of wild perfumesâ Winds! or Auloniads busy with beauty. MIRABILE DICTU I There dwells a goddess in the West, An Island in death-lonesome seas; No towered towns are hers confessed, No castled forts or palaces; Hers, simple worshipers at best, The buds, the birds, the bees. II And she hath wonder-words of song, So heavenly beautiful and shed So sweetly from her honeyed tongue, The savage creatures, it is said, Hark, marble-still, their wilds among, And nightingales fall dead. III I know her not, nor have I known: I only feel that she is there: For when my heart is most alone, Her deep communion fills the air,â Her influence calls me from my own,â Miraculously fair. IV Then fain am I to sing and sing, And then again to fly and fly, Beyond the flight of cloud or wing, Far under azure arcs of sky; My love at her chaste feet to fling, Behold her face andâdie. A DREAMER OF DREAMS He lived beyond men, and so stood Admitted to the brotherhood Of beauty; dreams, with which he trod Companioned as some sylvan god. And oft men wondered, when his thought Made all their knowledge seem as naught, If he, like Uther's mystic son, Had not been born for Avalon. When wandering 'mid the whispering trees, His soul communed with every breeze; Heard voices calling from the glades, Bloom-words of the Leimoniads; Or Dryads of the ash and oak, Who syllabled his name and spoke With him of presences and powers That glimpsed in sunbeams, gloomed in showers. By every violet-hallowed brook, Where every bramble-matted nook Rippled and laughed with water sounds, He walked like one on sainted grounds, Fearing intrusion on the spell That kept some fountain-spirit's well, Or woodland genius, sitting where Red, racy berries kissed his hair. Once when the wind, far o'er the hill, Had fall'n and left the wildwood still For Dawn's dim feet to glide across,â Beneath the gnarled boughs, on the moss, The air around him golden ripe With daybreak,âthere, with oaten pipe, His eyes beheld the wood-god, Pan, Goat-bearded, and half-brute, half-man; Who, shaggy-haunched, a savage rhyme Blew in his reed to rudest time; And swollen-jowled, with rolling eyeâ Beneath the slowly silvering sky, Whose light shone through the forest's roofâ Danced, while beneath his boisterous hoof The branch was snapped, and, interfused Between great roots, the moss was bruised. And often when he wandered through Old forests at the fall of dewâ A new Endymion who sought A beauty higher than all thoughtâ Some night, men said, most surely he Would favored be of deity: That in the holy solitude Her sudden presence, long pursued, Unto his gaze would be confessed; The awful moonlight of her breast Come, high with majesty, and hold His heart's blood till his heart were cold, Unpulsed, unsinewed, and undone, And snatch his soul to Avalon. PAN I Haunter of green intricÃ¡cies Where the sunlight's amber laces Deeps of darkest violet; Where the shaggy Satyr chases Nymphs and Dryads, fair as Graces, Whose white limbs with dew are wet: Piper in hid mountain places, Where the blue-eyed Oread braces Winds which in her sweet cheeks set Of Aurora rosy traces; While the Faun from myrtle mazes Watches with an eye of jet: What art thou and these dim races, Thou, O Pan, of many faces, Who art ruler yet? II Tell me, piper, have I ever Heard thy hollow syrinx quiver Trickling music in the trees? Where the hazel copses shiver, Have I heard its dronings sever The warm silence, or the bees? Ripple murmurings that never Could be born of fall or river, Or the whispering breeze. III Once in tempest it was given Me to see thee,âwhere the leven Lit the craggy wood with glare,â Dancing, while,âlike wedges driven,â Thunder split the deeps of heaven, And the wild rain swept thy hair.â What art thou, whose presence, even While with fear my heart was riven, Healed it as with prayer? A STORMY SUNSET I Soul of my body! what a death For such a day of grief and gloom, Unbroken sorrow of the sky!â 'Tis as if God's own loving breath Had swept the piled-up thunder by, And, bursting through the tempest's sheath, Cleft from its pod a giant bloom. II See how the glory grows! unrolled, Expanding length on radiant length Of cloud-wrought petals.âVast, a rose The western heavens of flame unfold, Where, sparkling thro' the splendor, glows The evening star, fresh-faced with strengthâ A raindrop in its heart of gold. A WOODLAND GRAVE White moons may come, white moons may go, She sleeps where early blossoms blow; Knows nothing of the leafy June, That leans above her, night and noon, Crowned now with sunbeam, now with moon, Watching her roses grow. The downy moth at evening comes And flutters round their honeyed blooms: Long, languid clouds, like ivory, That isle the blue lagoons of sky, Grow red as molten gold and dye With flame the pine-dark glooms. Dew, dripping from wet fern and leaf; The wind, that shakes the blossom's sheaf; The slender sound of water lone, That makes a harp-string of some stone, And now a wood-bird's twilight moan, Seem whisp'rings there of grief. Her garden, where the lilacs grew, Where, on old walls, old roses blew, Head-heavy with their mellow musk, Where, when the beetle's drone was husk, She lingered in the dying dusk, No more shall know that knew. Her orchard,âwhere the Spring and she Stood listening to each bird and bee,â That, from its fragant firmament, Snowed blossoms on her as she went, (A blossom with their blossoms blent) No more her face shall see. White moons may come, white moons may go, She sleeps where early blossoms blow; Around her headstone many a seed Shall sow itself; and briar and weed Shall grow to hide it from men's heed, And none will care or know. THE OLD BYWAY Its rotting fence one scarcely sees Through sumac and wild blackberries, Thick elder and the bramble-rose, Big ox-eyed daisies where the bees Hang droning in repose. The little lizards lie all day Gray on its rocks of lichen-gray; And there, gay Ariels of the sun, The butterflies make bright its way, And paths where chipmunks run. Its lyric there the redbird lifts, While, overhead, the swallow drifts 'Neath sun-soaked clouds of palest cream,â In which the wind makes azure rifts,â And there the wood-doves dream. The brown grasshoppers rasp and bound 'Mid weeds and briars that hedge it round; And in its grass-grown ruts,âwhere stirs The harmless snakeâmole-crickets sound; O'erhead the locust whirs. At evening, when the sad west turns To lonely night a cheek that burns, The tree-toads in the wild-plum sing; And ghosts of long-dead flowers and ferns The wind wakes, whispering. THE WOODPATH Here Spring her first frail violets blows; Broadcast her whitest wind-flowers sows Through starry mosses amber-fair, And fronded ferns and briar-rose, Hart's-tongue and maidenhair. Here fungus life is beautiful; Slim mushroom and the thick toadstool,â As various colored as are blooms,â Dot their damp cones through shadows cool, And breathe forth rain perfumes. Here stray the wandering cows to rest; The calling cat-bird builds its nest In spicewood bushes dark and deep; Here raps the woodpecker its best, And here young rabbits leap. Beech, oak, and cedar; hickories; The pawpaw and persimmon trees; And tangled vines and sumac-brush, Make dark the daylight, where the bees Drone, and the wood-springs gush. Here to pale melancholy moons, In haunted nights of dreamy Junes, Wails wildly the weird whippoorwill, Whose strains, like those the owlet croons, Wild woods with phantoms fill. THE SOUND OF THE SAP When the ice was thick on the flower-beds, And the sleet was caked on the briar; When the frost was down in the brown bulb's heads, And the ways were clogged with mire: When the snow on syringa and spirÃ¦a-tree Seemed the ghosts of perished flowers; And the days were sorry as sorry could be, And Time limped, cursing his fardel of hours: Heigh-ho! had I not a book and the logs, That chirped with the sap in the burning?â Or was it the frogs in the far-off bogs? Or the bush-sparrow's song at the turning? And I strolled by ways that the Springtime knows, In her mossy dells, and her ferny passes; Where the earth was holy with lily and rose, And the myriad life of the grasses. And I spoke with the Spring as a lover, who speaks To his sweetheart; to whom he has given A kiss that has kindled the rose of her cheeks, And her eyes with the laughter of heaven. The sound of the sap!âWhat a simple thing!â But the sound of the sap had the power To make the song-sparrow come and sing, And the winter woodlands flower! THE DRYAD I have seen her limpid eyes, Large with gradual laughter, rise In the wild-rose nettles; Slowly, like twin flowers, unfold, Smiling,âwhen the wind, behold! Whisked them into petals. I have seen her hardy cheek, Like a molten coral, leak Through the leaves around it Of thick Chickasaws; but so, When I made more certain, lo! A red plum I found it. I have found her racy lips, And her roguish finger-tips, But a haw or berry; Glimmers of her there and here, Just, forsooth, enough to cheer, And to make me merry. Often from the ferny rocks Dazzling rimples of her locks At me she hath shaken; And I've followedâbut in vain!â They had trickled into rain, Sunlit, on the braken. Once her full limbs flashed on me, Naked, where a royal tree Checkered mossy places With soft sunlight and dim shade,â Such a haunt as myths have made For the Satyr races. There, it seemed, hid amorous Pan; For a sudden pleading ran Through the thicket, wooing Me to search and, suddenly, From the swaying elder-tree, Flew a wild-dove, cooing. A DEAD LILY The South saluted her mouth Till her breath was sweet with the South. The North in her ear breathed low, Till her veins ran crystal and snow. The West 'neath her eyelids blew, Till her heart beat honey and dew. And the East with his magic old Changed her body to pearl and gold. And she stood like a beautiful thought That a godhead of love had wrought. . . . How strange that the Power begot it Only to kill it and rot it! THE DEAD OREAD Her heart is still and leaps no more With holy passion when the breeze, Her whilom playmate, as before, Comes with the language of the bees, Sad songs her mountain cedars sing, And water-music murmuring. Her calm, white feet,âonce fleet and fast As Daphne's when a god pursued,â No more will dance like sunlight past The gold-green vistas of the wood, Where every quailing floweret Smiled into life where they were set. Hers were the limbs of living light, And breasts of snow, as virginal As mountain drifts; and throat as white As foam of mountain waterfall; And hyacinthine curls, that streamed Like mountain mists, and gloomed and gleamed. Her presence breathed such scents as haunt Deep mountain dells and solitudes, Aromas wild,âlike some wild plant That fills with sweetness all the woods;â And comradeship with stars and skies Shone in the azure of her eyes. Her grave be by a mossy rock Upon the top of some high hill, Removed, remote from men who mock The myths, the dreams of life they kill; Where all of love and naught of lust May guard her solitary dust. PAX VOBISCUM I I know that from thine eyes The Spring her violets grew; Those bits of April skies, On which the green turf lies, Whereon they blossom blue. II I know that Summer wrought From thy sweet heart that rose, With such faint fragrance fraught,â Its pale, poetic thought Of peace and deep repose.â III That Autumn, like some god, From thy delicious hair,â Lost sunlight 'neath the sod,â Shot up this goldenrod To toss it everywhere. IV That Winter from thy breast The snowdrop's whiteness stoleâ Much kinder than the restâ Thy innocence confessed, The pureness of thy soul. AT REST I heard the dead man, where he lay Within the open coffin, say:â âWhy do they come to weep and cry Around me now?âBecause I lie So silent, and my heart's at rest? Because the pistons of my blood No more in this machinery thud? And on these eyes, that once were blessed With magnetism and fire, are pressed The soldered eyelids, like a sheath? On which the icy hand of Death Hath laid invisible coins of lead Stamped with the image of his head? âWhy will they weep and not have done? Why sorrow so? and all for one, Who, they believe, hath found the best God gives to us,âand that is rest. Why grieve?âYea, rather let them lift The voice in thanks for such a gift, That leaves the worn hands, long that wrought, And weary feet, that sought and sought, At peace; and makes what came to naught, In life, more real now than all The good men strive for here on Earth: The love they seek; the things they call Desirable and full of worth; Yea, wisdom ev'n; and, like the South, The dreams that dewed the soul's sick drouth, And heart's sad barrenness.âGod's rest, With every sigh and every tear, By them who weep above me here, Despite their Faith and Hope, 's confessed A doubt; a thing to dread and fear. âBefore them peacefully I lie. But, haply, not for me they sigh, But for themselves,âtheir loss. The round Of daily labor still to do For them, while for myself 'tis through; And all the unknown, too, is found, The bourn for which all hopes are bound, Where dreams are all made manifest: For this they grieve, perhaps. 'Tis well; Since 'tis through grief the soul is blessed, Not joy;âand yet, we can not tell, We do not know, we can not prove, We only feel that there is love, And something we call Heaven and Hell. âHowbeit, here, you see, I lie, As all shall lieâfor all must dieâ A cast-off, useless, empty shell, In which an essence once did dwell; That once, like fruit, the spirit held, And with its husk of flesh compelled: The mask of mind, the world of will, That laughed and wept and labored till The thing within, that never slept, The life essential, from it stept; The ichor-veined inhabitant Who made it all it was; in all Its aims the thing original, That held its course, like any star, Among its fellows; or a plant, Among its brother plants; 'mid whom,â The same and yet dissimilar,â Distinct and individual, It grew to microcosmic bloom.â These were the words the dead man said To me who stood beside the dead. DISTANCE I I dreamed last night once more I stood Knee-deep on purple clover leas; Her old home glimmered through its wood Of dark and melancholy trees: And on my brow I felt the breeze That blew from out the solitude, With sounds of waters that pursued, And sleepy hummings of the bees. II And ankle-deep in violet blooms Methought I saw her standing there, A lawny light among the glooms, A crown of sunlight on her hair; The wood-birds, warbling everywhere, Above her head flashed happy plumes; About her clung the wild perfumes, And woodland gleams of shimmering air. III And then she called me: in my ears Her voice was music; and it led My sad soul back with all its fears; Recalled my spirit that had fled.â And in my dream it seemed she said, âOur hearts keep true through all the years;â And on my face I felt the tears, The blinding tears of her long dead. DEFICIENCY Ah, God! were I away, away By woodland-belted hills! There might be more in this bright day Than my poor spirit thrills. The elder coppice, banks of blooms; The spicewood brush; the field Of tumbled clover, and perfumes Hot, weedy pastures yield. The old rail-fence, whose angles hold Bright briar and sassafras; Sweet, priceless wildflowers, blue and gold, Starred through the moss and grass. The ragged path that winds unto Lone, bird-melodious nooks, Through brambles to the shade and dew Of rocks and woody brooks. To see the minnows flash and gleam Like sparkling prisms; all Shoot in gray schools adown the stream Let but a dead leaf fall! To feel the buoyance and delight Of floating, feathered seeds! Capricious wisps of wandering white Born of silk-bearing weeds. Ah, God! were I away, away Among wild woods and birds, There were more soul in this bright day Than one could bless with words. MIDSUMMER The red blood stings through her cheeks and clings In their tan with a fever that lightens; And the clearness of heaven-born mountain springs In her dark eyes dusks and brightens: Her limbs are the limbs of an Atalanta who swings With the youths in the sinewy games, When the hot wind sings through the hair it flings, And the circus roars hoarse with their names, As they fly to the goal that flames. Her voice is as deep as the waters that sweep Through the musical reeds of a river; A voice as of reapers who bind and reap, With the ring of curved scythes that quiver: A voice, singing ripe the orchards that heap With crimson and gold the ground; That whispers like sleep, till the briars weep Their berries, all ruby round, And vineyards are purple-crowned. Right sweet is the beat of her glowing feet, And her smile, as Heaven's, is gracious; The creating might of her hands of heat As a god's or a goddess's spacious: The odorous blood in her heart a-beat Is rich with a perishless fire; And her bosom, most sweet, is the ardent seat Of a mother who never will tire, While the world has a breath to suspire. Wherever she fares her soft voice bears Fecundity; powers that thicken The fruits,âas the wind made Thessalian mares Of old mysteriously quicken:â The apricots' honey, the milk of the pears, The wine, great grape-clusters hold, These, these are her cares, and her wealth she declares In the corn's long billows of gold, And flowers that jewel the wold. So, hail to her lips, and her sun-girt hips, And the glory she wears in her tresses! All hail to the balsam that dreams and drips From her breasts that the light caresses! Midsummer! whose fair arm lovingly slips Round the Earth's great waist of green, From whose mouth's aroma his hot mouth sips The life that is love unseen, And the beauty that God may mean. DIURNAL I With molten ruby, clear as wine, The East's great cup of daybreak brims; The morning-glories swing and shine; The night-dews bead their satin rims; The bees are busy in flower and vine, And load with gold their limbs. Sweet Morn, the South A loyal lover, Kisses thy mouth, Thy rosy mouth, And over and over Wooes thee with scents of wild-honey and clover. II Beside the wall the roses blow That Noon's hot breezes scarcely shake; Beside the wall the poppies glow, So full of fire their deep hearts ache; The drowsy butterflies fly slow, Half sleeping, half awake. Sweet Noontide, Rest,â A reaper sleeping,â His head on thy breast, Thy redolent breast, Dreams of the reaping, While sounds of the scythes all around him are sweeping. III Along lone paths the cricket cries, Where Night distils dim scent and dew; One mad star 'thwart the heaven flies, A glittering curve of molten blue; Now grows the big moon in the skies; The stars are faint and few. Sweet Night, the vows Of love long taken, Against thy brows Lay their pale brows, Till thy soul is shaken Of amorous dreams that make it awaken. THE FAMILY BURYING GROUND A wall of crumbling stones doth keep Watch o'er long barrows where they sleep, Old, chronicled grave-stones of its dead, On which oblivion's mosses creep And lichens gray as lead. Warm days, the lost cows, as they pass, Rest here and browse the juicy grass That springs about its sun-scorched stones; Afar one hears their bells' deep brass Waft melancholy tones. Here the wild morning-glory goes A-rambling, and the myrtle grows; Wild morning-glories, pale as pain, With holy urns, that hint at woes, The night hath filled with rain. Here are the largest berries seen, Rich, winey-dark, whereon the lean Black hornet sucks; noons, sick with heat, That bend not to the shadowed green The heavy, bearded wheat. At night, for its forgotten dead, A requiem, of no known wind said, Through ghostly cedars moans and throbs, While to the starlight overhead The shivering screech-owl sobs. CLOUDS All through the tepid summer night The starless sky had poured a cool Monotony of pleasant rain In music beautiful. And for an hour I sat to watch Clouds moving on majestic feet; And heard down avenues of night Their hearts of thunder beat. Prodigious limbs, far-veined with gold, Pulsed fiery life o'er wood and plain, While, scattered, fell from giant hands The largess of the rain. Beholding at each lightning flash Their generous silver on the sod, In meek devotion bowed, I thanked These almoners of God. THE HERON I EVENING A vein of flame, the long creek crawls Beneath dark brows of woodland walls, Red where the sunset's crimson falls. One wiry leg drawn to his breast, Neck-shrunk, at solitary rest, The heron stands among the bars. II NIGHT The whimpering creek breaks on the stone, Where for a while the new moon shone With one white star and one alone. Lank haunter of lone marshy lands The melancholy heron stands, Then, clamoring, dives into the stars. AVATARS I When the moon hangs low Over an afterglow, Lilac and lily; When the stars are high, Wisps in a windless sky, Silverly stilly:â He, who will lean, his inner ear compelling, May hear the spirit of the forest stream Its story to a wildwood flower telling, That is no flower but some ascended dream. II When the dawn's first lines Show dimly through the pines Along the mountain; When the stars are few, And starry lies the dew Around the fountain:â Who will, may hear, within her leafy dwelling, The spirit of the oak-tree, great and strong, Its romance to the wildwood streamlet telling, That is no stream but some descended song. LILLITA Can I forget how, when you stood 'Mid orchards whence the bloom had fled, Stars made the orchards seem a-bud, And weighed the sighing boughs o'er-head With shining ghosts of blossoms dead? Or when you bowed, a lily tall, Above your drowsy lilies, slim, Transparent pale, that by the wall Like cups of moonlight seemed to swim, Brimmed with faint fragrance to the brim? And in the cloud that lingered lowâ A silent pallor in the westâ There stirred and beat a golden glow, Like some great heart that could not rest, A heart of gold within its breast. Your heart, your soul were in the wild: You loved to hear the whippoorwill Lament its love, when, dewy mild, The harvest scent made musk the hill. You loved to walk, where oft had trod The red deer, o'er the fallen hush Of Fall's torn leaves, when th' ivy-tod Hung frosty by each berried bush. Still do the whippoorwills complain Above your listless lilies, where The moonlight their white faces stain; Still flows the dreaming streamlet there, Whispering of rest an easeful air. . . . O music of the falling rain, At night unto her painless rest Sound sweet not sad! and make her fain To feel the wildflowers on her breast Lift moist, pure faces up again To breathe a prayer in fragrance blessed. Thick-pleated beeches long have crossed Old, gnarly arms above her tomb, Where oft I sit and dream her ghost Smiles, like a blossom, through the gloom; Dim as a mist,âthat summer lost,â Of tangled starbeam and perfume. MIRIAM White clouds and buds and birds and bees, Low wind-notes, piped down southern seas, Brought thee, a rose-white offering, A flower-like baby with the spring. She, with her April, gave to thee A soul of winsome witchery; Large, heavenly eyes and sparkling whence Shines the young mind's soft influence; Where love's eternal innocence, And smiles and tears of maidenhood, Gleam with the dreams of hope and good. She, with the dower of her May Gave thee a nature strong to sway Man's higher feelings; and a pride Where all pride's smallness is denied. Limbs wrought of lilies; and a face Made of a rose-bloom; and the grace Of water, that thy limbs express In each chaste billow of thy dress. She, with her dreamy June, brought down Night-deeps of hair that are thy crown; A voice like low winds musical, Or streams that in the moonlight fall O'er bars of pearl; and in thy heart,â True gold,âshe set Joy's counterpart, A gem, that in thy fair face gleams, All radiance, when it speaks or dreams; And in thy soul the jewel Truth Whose beauty is perpetual youth. TWO DAYS I The slanted storm tossed at their feet The frost-nipped autumn leaves; The park's high pines were caked with sleet, And ice-spears armed the eaves. They strolled adown the pillared pines, To part where wet and twisted vines About the gate-posts blew and beat. She watched him riding through the rain Along the river's misty shore, And turned with lips that laughed disdain: âTo meet no more!â II 'Mid heavy roses weighed with dew The chirping crickets hid; I' the honeysuckle avenue Sang the green katydid. Soft southern stars smiled through the pines. Through stately windows, draped with vines, The drifting moonlight's silver blew. She stared upon a face, now dead, A soldier calm that wore; Despair sobbed on the lips that said, âTo meet no more.â MOONRISE AT SEA I With lips that had hushed all their fury Of foam and of winds that were strewn, Of storm and of turbulent hurry, The ocean sighed; heralding soon A ship of miraculous glory, Of pearl and of fireâthe moon. II And up from the East, with a slipping And shudder and clinging of light, With a loos'ning of clouds and a dipping, Outbound for the Havens of Night, With a silence of sails and a dripping, The vessel came, wonderful white. III Then heaven and ocean were sprinkled With splendor; for every sheet And spar, and its hollow hull twinkled With mother-of-pearl. And the feet Of spirits, that followed it, crinkled The billows that under it beat. IN NOVEMBER No windy white of wind-blown clouds is thine! No windy white, but low and sodden gray, That holds the melancholy skies and kills The wild song and the wild-bird. Yet, ah me! Thy melancholy skies and mournful woods, Brown, sighing forests dying that I love! Thy long, dead leaves, deep, deep about my feet, Slow, dragging feet that halt or wander on; Thy deep, sweet, crimson leaves that burn and die With silent fever of the sickened wood. I love to hear in all thy wind-swept coignes, Rain-wet and choked with bleached and ruined weeds, The withered whisper of the many leaves, That, fallen on barren waysâlike fallen hopesâ Once held so high upon the Summer's heart Of stalwart trees, now seem the desolate voice Of Earth lamenting in hushed undertones Her green departed glory vanished so. IN LATE FALL O days, that break the wild-bird's heart, That slay the wild-bird and its songs! Why should death play so sad a part With you to whom such sweet belongs? Why are your eyes so filled with tears, As with the rain the frozen flowers? Why are your hearts so swept with fears, Like winds among the ruined bowers? Farewell! farewell! for she is dead, The old gray month; I saw her die: Go, light your torches round her head, The last red leaves, and let her lie. WITH THE SEASONS I You will not love me, sweet, When this brief year is past; Or love, now at my feet, At other feet you'll cast, At fairer feet you'll cast. You will not love me, sweet, When this brief year is past. II Now 'tis the Springtime, dear, And crocus-cups hold flame, Brimmed to the pregnant year, All bashful as with shame, Who blushes as with shame. Now 'tis the Springtime, dear, And crocus-cups hold flame. III Soon Summer will be queen, At her brown throat one rose, And poppy-pod, and bean, Will rustle as she goes, As down the garth she goes. Soon Summer will be queen, At her brown throat one rose. IV Then Autumn come, a prince, A gipsy crowned with gold; Gold weight the fruited quince, Gold strew the leafy wold, The wild and wind-swept wold. Then Autumn come, a prince, A gipsy crowned with gold. V Then Winter will be king, Snow-driven from feet to head; No song-birds then will sing, The winds will wail instead, The wild winds weep instead. Then Winter will be king, Snow-driven from feet to head. VI Then shall I weep, who smiled, And curse the coming years, You and myself, and child, Born unto shame and tears, A mother's shame and tears. Then shall I weep, who smiled, And curse the coming years. TYRANNY What is there now more merciless Than such fast lips that will not speak; That stir not if one curse or bless A God who made them weak? More maddening to one there is naught Than such white eyelids sealed on eyes, Eyes vacant of the thing named thought, An exile in the skies. Ah, silent tongue! ah, dull, closed ear! What angel utterances low Have wooed you? so you may not hear Our mortal words of woe! WHAT YOU WILL I When the season was dry and the sun was hot, And the hornet sucked, gaunt on the apricot, And the ripe peach dropped, to its seed a-rot, With a lean, red wasp that stung and clung: When the hollyhocks, ranked in the garden plot, More seed-pods had than blossoms, I wot, Then all had been said and been sung, And meseemed that my heart had forgot. II When the black grape bulged with the juice that burst Through its thick blue skin that was cracked with thirst, And the round, ripe pippins, that summer had nursed, In the yellowing leaves o' the orchard hung: When the farmer, his lips with whistling pursed, To his sun-tanned brow in the corn was immersed, Then something was said or was sung, And I remembered as much as I durst. III Now the sky of December gray drips and drips, And eaves of the barn the icicle tips, And the cackling hen on the snow-path slips, And the cattle shiver the fields among: Now the ears of the milkmaid the north-wind nips, And the red-chapped cheeks of the farm-boy whips, What, what shall be said or be sung, With my lips pressed warm to your lips! MIDWINTER The dewdrop from the rose that drips Hath not the sparkle of her lips, My lady's lips. Than her long braids of yellow hold The dandelion hath not more gold, Her braids of gold. The blue-bell hints not more of skies Than do the flowers of her eyes, My lady's eyes. The sweet-pea bloom shows not more grace Of delicate pink than doth her face, My lady's face. So, heigh-ho! then, though skies be gray, Spring blossoms in my heart to-day, This winter day! [IN THE GARDENS OF FALERINA] TO GERTRUDE These are the flowers I bring to thee, Heart's-ease, euphrasy and rue, Grown in my Garden of Poetry; Wear them, sweet, on thy breast for me: The first for thoughts; and the other two For spiritual vision, that's always true, So thou with thy soul mayst ever see The love in my heart I keep for thee. THE GARDENS OF FALERINA Her hills and vales are dimmer Than sunset's shadowy shimmer; Thin mists, that curl, of poppy and pearl, Above her bowers glimmer; And, silvered o'er with sails of faery galleys, Far off the sea gleams, glimpsed through fountained valleys. The moon floats never higher Than one white peak of fire; And in its beams pale Beauty dreams, And Music tunes her lyre; And, Siren-like, beside the moonlit waters, Fair Fancy sits singing with Memory's daughters. A cloud, above and under The ocean, white with wonder, Looms, starry steep; and, opening deep, Grows gold with silent thunder; Revealing far within, immeasurable, Lost Avalons of old Romance and Fable. Ah! could my spirit shatter These bonds of flesh and matter, And, at a word, mount like a bird To her through mists that scatter; And, raimented in love and inspiration, Look down on Earth from that exalted station: No mortal might inveigle My soul, that, like an eagle, Would soar and soar from shore to shore Of her, the rare and regal; And by her love made all a lyric rapture, A wild desire, wing far beyond all capture. ROMANCE Thus have I pictured her:âIn Arden old A white-browed maiden with a falcon eye, And rose-flushed face, and locks of wind-blown gold, Teaching her hawks to fly. Or, 'mid her boar-hounds, panting with the heat, In huntsman green, she sounds the hunt's wild prize, Plumed, dagger-belted, while beneath her feet The spear-pierced monster dies. Or in BrÃ©cÃ¨liand, on some high tower, Clad soft in samite, last of her lost race, I have beheld her, lovelier than a flower, Turn from the world her face. Or, robed in raiment of romantic lore, Like Oriana, dark of eye and hair, Riding through Realms of Legend evermore, And ever young and fair. Or now like Bradamant, as brave as just, In complete steel, her pure face lit with scorn, At heathen castles, dens of demon lust, Winding her bugle-horn. Another Una; and in chastity A second Britomart; in beauty far O'er her who led King Charles's chivalry And Paynim lands to war. . . . Now she, from Avalon's deep-dingled bowers,â 'Mid which white stars and never-waning moons Make marriage; and dim lips of musk-mouthed flowers Sigh faint and fragrant tunes,â Implores me follow; and, in shadowy shapes Of sunset, shows me,âmile on misty mile Of purple precipice,âall the haunted capes Of her enchanted isle. Where, bowered in bosks and overgrown with vine, Upon a headland breasting violet seas, Her castle towers, like a dream divine, With stairs and galleries. And at her casement, Circe-beautiful, Above the surgeless reaches of the deep, She sits, while, in her gardens, fountains lull The perfumed wind to sleep. Or, round her brow a diadem of spars, She leans to hearken, from her raven height, The nightingales that, choiring to the stars, Haunt with wild song the night. Or, where the moon is mirrored in the waves, To mark, deep down, the Sea King's city rolled, Wrought of huge shells and labyrinthine caves, Ribbed pale with pearl and gold. There doth she wait forever; and the kings Of all the world have wooed her: but she cares For none but him, the Heart, that dreams and sings, That sings and dreams and dares. THE VALLEY OF MUSIC I Oh, cool as the flutter of fountains, And fresh as the fall of the dew, Wet as the hues of the rain-arch, In that vale, is the dawn, when, o'er mountains, Pearl-peaked and hyaline blue, Through the Memnonian blue, Her spirit, like music, comes slowly, A music of light and of fire, Leaving her footsteps in roses There on its summits, while holy, Fair on her brow is her tire, Gemmed with the morning-star's fire. II And still as the incense of altars, And dim as the deeps of a cloud, Mystic as winds of the woodlands, In that vale, is the night when she falters In the sorrowful folds of her shroud, The far-blowing dusk of her shroud, By the scarlet-strewn bier of her lover, The day, lying faded and fair In his chamber of purple and vair.â When, above it, you see her uncover Her star-girdled darkness of hairâ Gold-hooped with the gold of the evenâ And for the day's burial prepare, The spirit of night in the heaven, O'er that vale, is most hauntingly fair; So fair that you wish it were given That you in the rays of her hair, Might die! in her gold-girdled hair. III There lies in a valley, where mountains Have walled it from all that is ours, A garden entangled with flowers; Where the whisper of echoing fountains Makes song in the balm-breathing bowers: Where torrents, plunged down from wild masses Of granite, from cavern-pierced steeps, With thunders sonorous cleave passes, And madden the world with their leaps, The clamorous foam of their leaps. IV And, oh! when the sunlight comes heaping With glitter the mist of those chasms, The foam of those musical chasms, You may hear a lamenting and weeping, And see in the vastness far sweeping, In wild and Ã¦olian spasms, Down, down in those voluble chasms, The Spirits of Light and of Darkness. And the wave from the gray-hearted granite In rivers rolls rippling around; Meanders through shade-haunted forests, Where many rock-barriers can span it, And dash it in froth and in sound; Where the nights with their great moons can wan it, Or star its dark stillness profound. V And here with her harp doth she wander, That daughter of music, twice kissed Of the Spirits of Love and of Sorrow: Yea, here doth she wander and ponder, That maiden of moonlight and mist, With starlight on hair and on wrist; Yea, here doth she ponder and wander 'Mid blossoms with loveliness whist, 'Mid moonlight with fragrances kissed. And ever her being grows fonder Of forests where phantoms keep tryst, The people of moon and of mist: And often they troop to her singing, As she sits 'mid the undulant cedarsâ All savage of wildness and scentâ Whose tops to her beauty are bent, Like the pennons and plumes of fierce leaders, In worship and testament: Like the pennons and plumes of fierce leaders, All ragged with battle and rent. VI And oft when the moon, like a palace Of witchcraft, shines white overhead, Making pearl of the foam of the torrent, She wakes her wild harp in the valleys Where the blossoms have built her a bed: She sits where a fountain of flowers Rains fragrance from branches around, The blossomed lianas around, Keeping time with their petal-sweet showers To her harp; with its strain interwound; Unfolding, it seems, to the sound: While her song is as redolence round her, And their fragrance as music, it seems, Whose touch and enchantment have bound her With shadows and whispers of dreams, And she seems but a part of her dreams, A creature created of dreams. VII One night as she whispered and wandered In her garden of music and flowers, She saw, in a ray of the moonlight, A youth fast asleep 'mid the flowers; A youth on a mantle of satin, A poppy-red robe 'mid the flowers. VIII Love housed 'neath his eyelids, that, slender As petals of roses, were pale: She bent and she kissed them and, tender, She murmured and bade them unveil, The blossoms beneath them unveil. And he woke and beheld her and panted:â âAt last I behold thee, O Song! O beautiful, pitiless Song! Thou, thou, who so wildly enchanted, And led me, eluded me long! Evaded and lured me so long!â IX Then she knelt on the mantle of satin, And plunged a long look in his eyes: She knelt on the mantle of scarlet, And kissed him on mouth and on eyes, And mingled her soul with his sighs. And then in a moment she knew it,â He deemed her a part of his dream; And she smiled and she said, âI am Music! And thy soulâ'twas my spirit that drew it, Thy soul, with a mystical gleam, A brightness, a glimmer, a gleam.â X And he gazed at her strangely; and, sobbing, Cried out, âYea; thy harp!âis it strung? Thy harp of wild gold, is it strung? With fingers of silver set throbbing Its chords with that song thou hast sung, So oft in my dreams thou hast sung.â XI Then he ceased:âand his eyesâhow they glistened! His eyes, that were haunted with pain, With longing and beauty and pain: And again he cried out, âOh, that music! That proud and that perilous music! O God! for that tyrannous strain, To which in my dreams I have listened, Ah, God! I have listened in vain!â And he tossed on the mantle of satin His deep raven darkness of hair; And the song at her lips was ungathered, And she sat there to marvel and stare; Like marble, to wonder and stare. XII Then there welled from her lips all the glory Of music delirious with words; Of music that told the heart's story, And trembled with God-given words, And rang like the crossing of swords. And it seemed that the spirit of Beauty Swept through it with farewells and sighs; The spirits of Beauty and Duty, And Love with his beautiful eyes; And Heaven, and Hell with its cries; Sad Hell with a tempest of cries. XIII The rapture was there of all passion; The heartache of all we have lost: The sweetness was there that we fashion From love we have won or have lost, Its terror, its torment, and cost. And over it all was a fury Of wings that seemed beating above, Of stars and of winds and the glory Of God and the splendor of love, The splendor and triumph of love. XIV And then, from her poppy wings, Slumber Dropped petals of sleep on his eyes; The Spirit of Slumber with pinions Of vaporous silver, whose flutter Had mixed with the music's wild number, Lured down from the shadowy skies; Lured down from her drowsy dominions, To nest in his tired-out eyes. XV And in sleep he cried out to her,âstilling A moment the rush of her song, The rainbowing torrent of song,â âCease! cease! for the rapture is killing! The glory of light is too strong!â Oh, cease! make an end of thy song!ââ But she, with the frenzy o'erflowing, Cried out in an anguish of passion, âThy soul shall be one with my song, With me and the soul of my song. Take my hand! let us walk in the glowing Sweet heaven and hell of all song; Where the torrents of music are flowing, The rivers of music and song. Take my hand! Dost thou hear? We are going! We, too, to God's splendor belong! Let us walk in the light of His song, The thunder and flame of His song.â XVI Then she flung in her song the emotion, Triumphant, of heart and of soul; Till the passion and pain were an ocean That swept her with billowing roll, As it seemed, to abysses of dole, Abysses of infinite dole. XVII And paler than moonlight and marble He lay on the red of that robe, Lay white at her feet on the scarlet, With silence-sealed lips and the glitter Of tears in each violet globe Of his eyes.âAnd she said: âIt is bitter To see him so still on this robe, Like marble so still on this robe.â Then she knelt and cried out, âArt thou living? Or dead?âHave I slain thee with song?â I gave thee the best in my giving, But all that I gave thee seems wrong!â No blessing, a curse was my song! A curse and a sorrow my song!â XVIII And she shattered her harp in her madness, And rent at her breasts and her hair; Then kissed him on mouth and on temples, And spoke to him smoothing the sadness, The calm of his brow that was fair, Was perfect and hopelessly fair. Then she wailed to the stars in the heaven, And railed at her song as a thief, Calling out, âFor a curse wast thou given! Yea, thou! for a curse and a grief! A curse and an infinite grief!â XIX And the moon, it went down like a broken Great dagger of gold in the west; Like a dagger of gold that was broken, Her dagger of song, that had spoken, And pierced with its beauty his breast, Had ravished his soul from his breast. And she lay with her hair, deep and golden, Thick showered and shaken on his; Her arms around him were enfolden; Her lips clave to his with a kiss, The love and the grief of a kiss. BLODEUWEDD Not to that demon's son, whom Arthur erst, For necromancy, at Caerleon, first Graced greatly, Merlin,ânot to him alone Did those lost learnings of white magic, known As sorcery and witchcraft, then belong. Taliesin, now, hath told us in a song Of one at Arvon, Math of Gwynedd; lord Of some vague cantrevs of the North; whose sword Beat back and slew a southern king, through wrath And puissance of Gwydion, whose path Thence on, with love, he honored. Now this Math Was learned in wondrous witchcraft: as he willed, He wrought the invisible visible, and filled The sight with seeming shapes, which it believed Realities, nor knew it was deceived. For, at his word, the winds were wan with tents, And armies rose of airy elements; And brassy blasts of war from bugles brayed, And armored hosts in battle clanged and swayed, And at a word were not. And at his nod, Steeds, rich-accoutered, whinnying softly, trod The dÃ¦dal earth; and hounds, of greater worth, And wirier, too, than dogs of mortal birth, Rose up, like forest fungus, from the earth Around th' astonished stag, or flying doe, Let Math but wish it or his trumpet blow. But only things that had their counterpart On earth could he make real through his art. Now, to his castle, Math, through Gwydion,â The son of Don,âthe daughter dark of Don, The silver-circled Arianrod, had brought; A southern rose of beauty, whom Math thought To wed, in love and friendship, without blame, And at Caer Dathyl. When the maiden came Said Math, âArt thou a virgin?ââLike a flame Mantling, her answer angered, âVerily, I know not other, lord, than that I be!ââ So wrought he then through magic that the form Of her boy baby seemed upon her arm, White as a rose. âA Mary!âYea!â laughed Math; âForsooth, another Mary!â then in wrath Laid harsh hands on the babe and fiercely flung Far in the salt sea. But the strong winds clung Fast to the Elfin and the lithe waves swept Him safely shoreward dry; some fishers kept Him thus unseaed and christened Dylan, fair Son of the wave, and fostered him with care. Nor was this really hers. But Gwydion, Brother to Arianrod, before the sun Had time to glimpse it with one golden glaive, Swiftly,âas hoping the real babe to save,â Some dim small body on the castle pave In raven velvet seized; and, hiding, he Stole this from court, to subtly raise to be A comely youth. In time, to Arianrod Came, swearing by the rood and blood of God He brought her back her son. Quoth she: âMore shame Dost thou disgrace thyself with, and more blame Dost damn thyself with, thus to mix our name With this dishonor, brother, than myself!â Then, waxing wroth, cried Gwydion, âThe Elf Is thine then?âTell me, wanton! is thy son Dylan, the fisher, or this fair-haired one, This youth?âGod's curse!ââand daggered her with looks. And she in turn waxed fiery, saying, âBooks Of magic I have read as well as Math! And now I tell thee, keep from out my path! Thou and thy bastard, he as well as thou! Thou dog! And on thy folly, listen, now I lay a threefold curse: behold! the firstâ Until I name him, nameless be he! Cursed Be they who give him arms!âthe second:ânor Shall he bear arms until I arm for war. And, lastly, know, however high his birth, He shall not wed a woman of the Earth!â Malignity! to shame me with thy sin!â Then passed into her tower and locked her in. But Gwydion, departing with the youth, Sware he would compass her; if not through truth, Through wiles and learnÃ©d magic. And he wrought So that unbending Arianrod was brought To name the lad. Again he managed that, Though strange enchantments as of war, he gat Her to give arms. But then, not for his life, Howbeit, could he get the youth a wife. Persisting, desperate, at last the thing Wrought in him blusterous as a backward spring. Now Llew the youth was named. And Gwydion Made his complaint to Math, the mighty son Of Mathonwy. Said Math: âDespair not. We With charms, illusions, and white sorcery Will seek to makeâfor mine are wondrous powersâ A woman for him out of forest flowers.â And so they toiled together one wan night, When the full moon hung low, and watched, a white Wild wisp-like face behind a mist. They took Blossoms of briars, blooming by a brook Shed from the April hills; and phantom blooms Of yellow broom that filtered faint perfumes; And primrose blossoms, frail, of rainy smell, Weak pink, dim-clustered in a glow-worm dell; Wild-apple sprigs, that tipsied bells of blaze, And in far, haunted hollows made a haze Of ghostly, fugitive fragrance; and the blue Of hollow harebells, hoary with the dew; The gold of kingcups, golden as low stars; And white of lilies,ârolled in limpid bars, Like sleepy foam,âthat swayed aslant and spilled Slim nectar-cups of musk the rain had filled; And paly, wildwood wind-flowers; and the gloss And glow of celandine; and bulbs that boss And dot the oak-roots bulging up the moss; Last, on the elfin uplands, pulled the buds, That burn like spurts of moonlight when it suds The showering clouds, of blossomed meadow-sweet, And made a woman fair; from head to feet Complete in beauty. One far lovelier Than Branwen, daughter of the gray King Llyr; Or that dark daughter of Leodegrance, The stately Gwenhwyvar. And young romance Dreamed in the open Bibles of her eyes: Music her motion; and her speech, like sighs Of roses swinging in the wind and rain, And lilies dancing on the sunlit plain: And in her eyes and face there bloomed again The bluebell and the poppy; and fern and bud Gave grace and glory to her maidenhood: And all the attributes of all the flowers Were in her body, that was not like ours And yet was like: but in her brow and face Was love alone and beauty, and no trace, No least suggestion of an earthly pain, Or hate, or sorrow, or of worldly stain; But hope, high heart, and happiness of life. And Blodeuwedd they named her; and, for wifeâ Baptizing her with light and dawn and dewâ Gave, that next morning, to the happy Llew. AMADIS AT MIRAFLORES I MORNING The quickening Day climbs to one star, That, cradled, rocks itself in morn; Whose airy opal, flaming far, Makes fire of the mountain tarn. The hosts of morning storm the sky With streaming splendor, their bright lips Blow laughter wild that shakes the rye, And, from the bough, the dew that drips On Oriana walking by. The calling rooks swarm round the towers: A heron sweeps through deeps of glare: And Falconry among the bowers Whistles his falcon down the air: While in the woods the bugled Hunt, With bearded cheeks, blows wild a-mort As dies the boar; or, front to front, Upon the baying hounds, the hart Turns, antlering at the battle's brunt. The heath-cock, stout amid his dames, Upon the purple-heathered hill, With glossy coat the morn enflames, Sounds to his rivals challenge shrill. Where, tossing white its plume of foam, The fountain leaps and twinkles by, Embodying dawn and all its bloom, My Oriana draweth nigh, Sweet as the heath-bell's wild perfume. The mountain tarn is like a cloud Of fallen and reflecting blue; In azure deeps the larks are loud, The larks that soar through dawn and dew. A wild-swan, mirrored in the mere, Moves with its image breast to breastâ As our two souls as one appear When to my heart her heart is pressed, The heart of Oriana here. II EVENING O sunset, from the springs of stars, Draw down thy cataracts of gold; And belt their streams with burning bars Of ruby on which flame is rolled: Drench dingles with laburnum light; Drown every copse in violet blaze: Rain rose-light down; and, poppy-bright, Die downward o'er the hills of haze, And bring at last the stars of night! The stars and moon! that silver world, That, like a spirit, faces west, Her foam-white feet with light empearled, Bearing white flame within her breast: Earth's sister sphere of fire and snow, Who shows to Earth her heart's pale heat, And bids her see its pulses glow, And hear their crystal currents beat With beauty, lighting all below. O cricket, with thy elfin pipe, That tinkles in the grass and grain; And dove-pale buds, that, dropping, stripe The glen's blue night, and smell of rain; O nightingale, that so dost wail On yonder branch of blossoming snow, Thrill, fill the wild hart-haunted dale, Where Oriana, walking slow, Approaches thro' the moonlight pale. She comes to meet me! Earth and air Grow radiant with another light. In her dark eyes and her dark hair Are all the stars and all the night. She comes! I clasp her! and it is As if no grief had ever been. The world takes fire from our kiss.â There are no other women or men But Oriana and Amadis! URGANDA It is Sir Elid of the Sword, Of whom his wife, Helis, hath heard For three long years no wished-for word. His armor dofft, he comes in fur And velvet, all the warrior, And takes her hand and kisses her. âThrice have I seen the summer die; And thrice the autumn, fading, lie: And heard the weary winter sigh, âSince last, my lord, my own true heart, From me, thy wife, with love, didst part, And rode to war with Lisuarte:ââ So said Helis with many tears:â âStill welcome, Elid! though long years Of silence, what with doubts and fears, âHave made me deem that thou wast dead.â Why dost thou stare so overhead?â What is it that thy soul doth dread?â He said to her: âMy own, my best, To thee alone . . . Witch! wilt thou wrest This hour from me? . . . shall be confessed The thing that will not let me rest. âIt was at Hallowmas I spurred Through woods wherein no wild thing stirred, No sound of brook, no song of bird. âWhen softly down a tangled way A dim fair woman, white as day, Rode on a palfrey misty gray. âUpon her brow a circlet burned Of jewels, and the fire, inurned Within them, changed, and turned and turned. âI stared like one, who, wild and pale, Spurs, hag-led, through the night and hail: When, lo! adown a forest vale An angel with the Holy Grail. âIt vanishes; but, once beheld, The longing heart is never quelled, Its loveliness hath so enspelled.â âShe vanished. And I rode alone, Save for a voice that did intone, âUrganda is she, the Unknown. ââAnd never shalt thou clasp the form Of her who leads thee by a charm To follow her through sun and storm.â âI can not stay for weal or woe. E'en now her magic bids me go, Soft-summoning through wind and snow.â Helis with some old song beguiles His hollow face until it smiles; And with her lute shapes sweeter wiles: Till kingly figures, woven in The shadowy arras, seem to win Strange, ghostly life, and slay and sin. Until her deep hair's golden glow Sweeps his dark curls as, praying low, She kneels, a marble-sculptured woe. And then she left him there to rest, A weary with his haggard quest, All in gray fur and velvet dressed. . . . At midnight through the vaulted roof She heard armed steps of ringing proof: She heard a charger's iron hoof. The leaded lattice glowed, a square Of moonlight in the moonlit air: She flung it wide: what saw she there? Sir Elid in the moonlight's beam, Stark, staring as if still a-dream Rode downward towards the rushing stream. His helm and corselet had he on, And, in one gauntlet, silver-wan, His bugle-horn was upward drawn. Upon his horn he blew his best; Then sang, it seemed, his merriest, âI ride upon my love's last quest: And on her breast at last shall rest.â Straight onward by some mighty will, Into the stream below the hill She saw him ride. Then all was still. . . . Not wider than her eyes are his That stare, where icy eddies kiss His lips. âUrganda's work is this!â She cries, and where her warrior lies With horror in his face and eyes, She bends above his form and sighs. And then she seems to hear a moan Beside her;âbut she leans alone:â Then laughter; and a cloud seems blown Before her eyes, that doth intone: âBeware, Helis! beware! beware My curse! my kiss, that is despair! Kiss not his brow, lest unaware, Helis, Helis, my curse be there!â HAWKING I I see them still, when poring o'er Old volumes of romantic lore, Ride forth to hawk, in days of yore, By woods and promontories: Knights in gold-lace, plumes and gems, Damsels crowned with anadems,â Whose falcons perch on wrists, like milk, In hoods and jesses of green silk,â From bannered Miraflores. II The laughing earth is young with dew; The deeps above are violet blue; And in the East a cloud or two Empearled with airy glories; And with merriment and singing, Silver bells of falcons ringing, Beauty, rosy with the dawn, Lightly rides o'er hill and lawn From towered Miraflores. III The torrent glitters from the crags; Down forest vistas browse the stags; And from wet beds of reeds and flags The frightened lapwing hurries: And the brawny wild-boar peereth At the cavalcade that neareth; Oft his shaggy-throated grunt Brings the king and court to hunt At royal Miraflores. IV The May itself, in soft sea-green, Is Oriana, Spring's high queen, And Amadis beside her seen, Some prince of Fairy stories: Where her castle's ivied towers Drowse above her woods and bowers, Flaps the heron through the sky, And the wild-swan gives a cry By knightly Miraflores. ORLANDO SUGGESTED BY ARIOSTO'S âORLANDO FURIOSOâ I When southern winds sowed woods and skies, Angelica! With bloom-storms of the flowering May; When hill and battle-field were gay With peace and purity of flowers, I sat to dream Beside a stream amid the bowers, Clear as the deeps of thy blue eyes: And near the stream I saw a grotto banked with flowers, From which the streamlet fell in showers, Cool-sparkling through the sunlit bowers, Angelica! II My casque I dofft to scoop the fount, Angelica! With liquid pureness bubbling cool It roseâthen clashed into the pool . . . Thy name I saw, hewn in the rock! And under it . . . Ah no! I dreamed! my eyes did mock My senses! . . . Then I seemed to count, All fire-lit, The letters! deep, carved in the rock! Medoro carved in every rock!â My brain went round like some wild clock, Angelica! III O treachery! O lust of blood! Angelica! That one so fair should be so vile! No more for me again shall smile The brows of Beauty! As of old, With clarion call, No more shall Battle make me bold! Or Chivalry fire my soul! . . . The wood,â Away from all, From love and lust,âshall house and hold My misery! . . . The dawn breaks cold! And I lie naked on the wold, Angelica! YOLANDA OF THE TOWERS Old forests belt and bar Her towering battlements; And all the west, with crest on crest, The blue o' the hills indents. Her garden's terrace cliffs That soar above a sea Dreamier and fuller of shadowy color Than sunset's mystery. And league on league of coast, Sand-ribbed of wind and wave, Rolls dim and far with reef and bar And many an ocean cave. The morning,âbright with beams And sea-winds,âwakes the day; Its breezy lutes and foamy flutes Make music on the bay. The deer are roused from rest; The sea-birds breast the brine; And from the steep wild torrents leap Foaming 'neath rock and vine. But she, in one tall tower, High built above the tide, In her heart a thorn, turns from the morn, Wan-faced and weary-eyed. Long, long she looks a-sea, As one who seeks a sail: But on her view the empty blue Beats and her eyelids quail. She turns and slowly goes Down from her sea-gray towers, To walk and weep, like one asleep, Among the salt-slain flowers. Until the sun is set, And crocus heavens, grown cold, Leave all their light to the new moon's white And one star's point of gold. Until a breeze from sea Sets in, of balm and spice And streams amid the stars, half-hid, Thin mists as white as ice. And then her eyes grow large With hate or one last hope, And again she bends her gaze where blends The sea with heaven's slope. But naught the night reveals, The night that seems to weep And shudder down two stars, that drown Themselves within the deep. Then to herself she says, Softly, âAh God! to know No death or shame is his, or blame, Who brought on me this woe! âWhat though I know that Hell At last will have its own; It will not heal my soul, I feel, Though there he wail and moan. âCould I his carrion see, On yonder crag's wild crest, Hung up to rot, a traitor's lot, My soul might find some rest!â . . . And this is she God made Of sunlight and of flowers For love and kisses and fond caressesâ Yolanda of the Towers. ERMENGARDE Queen of the Courts of Love, she sleeps; one arm Pillowing her raven hair, as Dawn might Night, Or Day kiss Dusk; or Darkness, starry warm, Be gathered of her sister, rosy Light. Pale from the purple of the damask cloth One hand hangs, as a lily-bloom might, lone Above a bed of poppies; or a moth Might softly hover by a rose full-blown. Heraldic, rich, the costly coverings Sweep, fall'n in folds, pushed partly from her breast; As through storm-broken clouds the full moon springs, From these one orb of her pure bosom pressed. She sleeps: and where the moteless moonbeams sink Through blazoned panesâan immaterial snowâ In wide, white jets, the lion-fur seems to drink With tawny jaws their wasted, winey glow. Light-lidded sleep and holy dreams are hers, Untouched of feverish sorrow or of care, Soft as the wind whose fragrant breathing stirs The moonbeam-tangled tresses of her hair. HACKELNBERG I When down the Hartz the echoes swarm, He rides beneath the mountain storm With mad âhalloo!â and wild alarm Of hound and horn and thunder: With his hunter, black as night, Ban-dogs, eyed with lambent light; And a stag, a spectral white, Rushes on before, in flight Glimmering through the boughs and under. II Long-howling, crouched in bracken black, The werewolf shuns his ruinous track, On every side the forests crack, And mountain torrents tumble: And the spirits of the air Whistling whirl with scattered hair, Teeth that flash and eyes that glare, Round him as he gallops there, In the rain and tempest's rumble. III Above the storm, the thunder's growl, The torrent's roar, the forest's howl, Is heard his hunting-hornâan owl, That hoots and sweeps before him: And beneath the blinding leven, On wild crags, the Castle riven Of the Dumburg towers to heaven, Beckoning on the demon-driven, Beckoning on and looming o'er him. AN ANTIQUE Mildewed and gray a marble stair Leads to a balustrade of urns, Beyond which two stone satyrs glare From vines and close-clipped yews and ferns. A path, that winds and labyrinths, 'Twixt parallels of verdant box, Around a lodge whose mossy plinths Are based on emerald-colored rocks. A lodge, or ancient pleasure-house, Built in a grove beside a lake, Around whose edge the dun deer browse, And swans their snowy pastime take. And underneath and overhead,â The breathings of a water-nymph It seems,âthe violets' scent is shed Mixed with the music of the lymph. And where,âupon its pedestal,â The old sun-dial marks the hours, Laburnum blossoms lightly fall, And duchess roses rain their flowers. The air is languid with perfume, As if dead beautiesâwho of old Intrigued it here in patch and plumeâ Again the ancient terrace strolled With gallants, on whose rapiers gems Once sneered in haughtiness of hues, While Touchstone wit and apothegms Laughed down the long cool avenues: And there, where bowers of woodbine pave, All heavily with sultry musk, Two fountains of pellucid wave, In sunlight-tessellated dusk, I seem to see the fountains twain Of Hate and Love in Arden, where, In times of regal Charlemagne, Great Roland drank and Oliver. Where, wandered from Montalban's towers, The paladin, Rinaldo, slept, While, leaning o'er him through the flowers, Angelica above him wept. JAAFER THE BARMECIDE Scene, Baghdad: time of the Khalif Haroun er Reshid. Salih ben Tarif speaks. With Imam Hassan I had reached the khan Outside of Ambar. Jaafer at the door Of his pavilion watched a caravan Inbound from Yemen.âAh, the bales it bore Of richest stuffs and spices!â'Mid the rout Of porters, camel-drivers, old and poor, A singer stood,âa blindman, singing out With luted preludes. Imam Hassan then: â'Tis Zekkar; he, t' whom, with the blind about The Mosque of Moons, I with our holy men Scattered my silver at the hour of prayer, When hearts are open unto Allah's ken.â Danic or dirhem, though, were wasted there: Yea, by the Prophet! had one sown dinars He had not budged one finger or that stare. And so the beggars and the scavengers Got all.â Then I: âThe very same whom Iâ Guard at the Western Portalâ'neath the stars Some midnights past heard singing. Dim the dry Hot night; and Baghdad only knew of us Until, gray shadows shuffling slowly by, Pilgrims for Mecca passed, all vaporous In dust and darkness; them we challenged not. âSlaves, with the tribute of Nicephorus The Roman, from long shallops, as they shot Along the moonlit Tigris far away, Timing their oars, raised languid chanting.âWhat This blindman sang was sweeter thanâlet's sayâ The songs of Ibrahim, the dulcet frets Of Zulzul's lute. I listened till the day Made gold of all the city's minarets, And the muezzin summoned us to pray.â Now while we gossiped, lounging slow along The packed bazaar, a fisher with his nets Passed, singing Abou Newas' newest song: A honey-merchant, then, his tinkling mule All hanap-hung with sweetness: then a throng Of scholars and their Sheikh from mosque or school: A milk-white woman on a cream-white ass, Black slaves attending. . . . AndâI am no fool!â I knew her of the Court, the noblest class, By her gem-bangled bracelets. . . . Let Haroun On the Euphrates with Zubeideh pass A single day, at royal Rekkeh,ânoon And night his harem here, so it is said, Is all intrigue.âThen drawling out his tune, âTen thousand pieces to be paid, be paid, For Yehya's head, Er Reshid's late vizier,â A crier passed us. Then the market's shade Glittered with weapons; and we seemed to hear, Sword of the Khalif, Mesrour, and commands Naming the Khalif. One swart officer Flamed forth the Sultan's signet. And harsh hands Were laid onâwhom?âI saw not! For my sight Was dazzled by the scimitars,âfrom bands Of jeweled belts that burned,âand, keen and bright, Swift hedged us out. Then broad the red blood dyed The ground around a bodyâand, hoar white, Was raised a severed head.âAnd, stupefied, Elbowing the rabble, âBy my beard!â I cried, Marking the face, âJaafer the Barmecide!â A PRE-EXISTENCE An intimation of some previous life? Or dark dreamâby my waking soul divinedâ Of some uncertain sleep? in which the sin Of some past life, a life that some one livedâ Not I, yet I,âlong, long ago in Spain, I live again. . . . Wherein again I see From heathen battles to Toledo's gates,â Damascened corselet broken, his camail And armet shattered,âdeep within the eve's Anger of brass, that burned around his helm, A hurrying flame,âa galloping glitter,âone Ride arrow-wounded. And the city catch Wild tumult from his coming, wilder fearâ A cry before him and a wail behind, Of walls beleaguered; ravin; conquered kings: Triumphant Taric; shackled Spainârevenge. And I, a Moslem slave, a miser Jew's, Housed near the Tagusâsqualid and alone, Save for his slave,âa dog he beat and starved,â Leaner than my lank shadow when the moon, A battle beacon, westerns; all my bones A visible hunger; famished with the fear, Soul-garb of slaves, I bore himâI, who held Him, heart and soul, more hated than his God, Stood silent. Fools had laughed. I saw my way. War-times grow weapons, and the blade I found Was hacked but pointed.âWell I knew his ways: The nightly nuptials of his jars of gems And bags of doublas.âWell I knew his ways. No figure, woven in the hangings, where He hugged his riches in that secret room, Was half so still as I, who gauntly stole Behind him, humped and stooping; and his heart Clove to the center, stabbing from behind, Thrice thro' his tattered tunic, murrey-dyed. Forward he fell, his old face 'mid his gold, Grayer and thinner than the moon of morn, While slow the blood dripped, oozing through the cloth, Black, and thick-clotting round the oblong wounds. Great pearls of Oman, whiter than the moon; Rubies of BadakhshÃ¢n, whose bezels wept Slim tears of poppy-purpled flame; and rich, Rose, ember-pregnant carbuncles, wherein Fevered a captive crimson, blurred with light The table's raven cloth. Dim bugles wan Of cat-eyed hyacinths; moon-emeralds With starry greenness stabbed; in limpid stains Of liquid lilac, Persian amethysts; Fire-opals, savage and mesmeric with Voluptuous flame, long, sweet and sensuous as Deep eyes of Orient women; sapphires beamed With talismanic violet, from tombs, Deev-guarded, of primordial Solimans, Scattered the velvet: and like gledes amid,â Splintering the light from rainbow-arrowed orbs,â Length-agonized with fire, diamonds of Golconda. . . . (One a dervish once had borne Seven days, beneath a red Arabian sun, Seven nights, beneath a round Arabian moon, Under his tongue; an Emeer's ransom, held Of some wild tribe.âBleached in the perishing waste, A Bedouin Arab found sand-strangled bones, A skeleton, vulture-torn, fierce in whose skull One eyeball blazedâthe diamond. At Aleppo Bartered . . . a bauble for his desert love.) Jacinth and Indian pearl, gem heaped on gem, Flashed, rutilating in the taper's light,â Unearthly splinters of a rainbowed flame,â A blaze of irised fire; and his face, Long-haired, white-sunk among them. And I took All! yea! all! all!âjewel and gold and gem!â Although his curse burned in them! 'though, meseemed, Each burning jewel glared a separate curse. Can dead men work us evil from the grave? Can crime infest us so that fear will slay? . . . Richer than all Castile and yetânot dare Drink but from cups of Roman murra,âspar Bowl-sprayed with fibrile gold,âspar sensitive To poison! I, no fool! and yetâa fool To fear a dead Jew's malice! . . . Yet, how else? Feasting within the music of my halls, While perfumed beauty danced in sinuous robes, Diaphanous, more tenuous than those famed Of loomed Amorgos or of silken Kos, Draining the unflawed murrhine, Xeres-brimmed, Had I reeled poisoned, dying wolf'sbane-slain! THE KING Up from the glimmering east the full moon swung, A golden bubble buoyed zenithward Above black hills. The white-eyed stars, that thronged,â Hot with the drought,âthe cloudless slopes of heaven, Winked thirstily; no wind aroused the leaves, That o'er the glaring road hung motionless, Withered and whitened of the weary dust From many hoofs of many a fellowship Of knights who rode to'ards quest or tournament: Among them those who brought the King disguised, Whose mind was, âin the lists to joust and be An equal 'mid unequals, man to man:â Who from the towers of Edric passed, wherein Some days he'd sojourned, waiting Launcelot: That morn it was; . . . for, with the morn, a horn Sang at dim portals, musical with dew, Wild echoes of wild woodlands and the hunt, Clear herald of the stanchest of his knights. And they, to the great tilt at Camelot, Rode armored off, a noise of steel and steeds. Thick in the stagnant moat the lilies lay, Pale 'mid their pads; above them, huge with chains, The drawbridge hung before the barbÃ©d grate; And far above, along lone battlements, His armor moon-drenched, one lone sentinel Clanked drowsily; and it was late in June. She, at her lattice, loosely night-robed, leaned, Thinking of one she loved: a pensive smile Haunting her face; a face as fair as night's, Night's when divinely beautiful with stars, Two stars, at least, that dreamed beneath her brows. Long, raven loops and coils of sensuous hair Rolled turbulence round white-glimpsed neck and throat, That shamed the moonlight with a rival sheen. One stooped above her; and his nostrils breathed Heavy perfumes that blossomed in her hair; And round her waist hooped one strong arm and drew Her mightily to him, soft crushing,âcool With yielding freshness of her form,âher gown; Then searched her eyes until his own seemed drunk And mad with passion: then one hungry kiss Bruised, hard as anger, on her breathless lips, Fiercer than fire. Leaning lower, then A whispered, âLov'st but one? and he?ââAnd then, She, with impatience, âRough and rude thou art! Why crush me, thou great bear, with such a hug! Or kill me with such kisses!ââThen, as soft As some rich rose syllabling musk and dew, âAnd whom I love?âah, Edric, need I say!â . . . Then he, fierce-smiling, swiftly, without word, His countenance harsh-writhen into hate's Gnarled hideousness, haled back her marvelous head, Back, back by all its braids of gathered hair, Till her full bosom's clamorous loveliness Stark on the moon burst bare. Low leaning then, With mocking laughter, âYea, by God's own blood! The King, O thou adulteress!â and a blade Glanced, thin as ice, plunged hard, hard in her heart. MELANCHOLIA âJamque vale Soli cum diceret Ambrociotes, In Stygios fertur desiluisse lacus, Morte nihil dignum passus: sed forte Platonis Divini eximum de nece legit opus.â âCallimachus. I Now there was wind that night, wild wind, and rain; And frantic thorns, that huddled on the wold, Seemed withered witches met in storm again To keep their Sabbath and to curse and scold, With gnarled, fantastic gestures, lame and old. Deep in a hollow, where some cabin lay, A lamplit window, like an eye of gold, Glared, winked and closedâor was't an Elfin ray, A jack-o'-lanthorn gleam, lost on a wildwood way? II Still I held onward through the ugly night; Breast-deep in thistles, all their ghostly heads Kinked close with wet; through the bedraggled plight Of brakes of bramble, tousled into shreds, And tangled wastes of briarsâtumbling beds For winds to toss on.âOnce, across a farm, Unsteadily, a lamp towards unseen sheds,â Like the blurred glow of some ungainly worm,â A watery wisp of light crawled trailing through the storm. III Then swallowing blackness of the night; and thin The shrewd rain beat me and the rough limbs whipped Of dwarfed, uneasy beeches. There within Their savage circle battered tombstones tipped Squat lengths to weeds the fighting winds had ripped And chopped to tatters. And I heard before, Rounding a headland, where the gaunt trees dripped,â A shout borne deathward from night's ghastly shore,â Hoarse as a thousand throats the river's sullen roar. IV Shuddering I stopped, for, with my feet so caked With clay, damp-dragging, safer were the graves, Crowding that vista of the wood,âwhich raked My face with burrs,âthan, walking towards the waves, To feel earth slip away; the architraves Of darkness plunge me downward to some pit Of wallow and of water.âMadder knaves Than I have stood thus in a fever-fit Of heart and brain and shuddered from the brink of it. V Wooingly silence whispered to me there Through boughs of dripping darkness sad with rain; Darkness, that met my eyeballs everywhere, Blind-packed and vacant as a madman's brain. And so I stood and heard the dead leaves drain, And through the leaves the haunted wind that hissed; Then suddenlyâperhaps it was the strain Snapped in my templesâlaughter seemed to twist, With evil, night's dead mouth that bent to mine and kissed. VI Insanity! two leaves that dabbled down, Touched me with drizzle; and that laughâah, well, No laugh! an owlet hooting at the frown Night's hag-face tortures while she works her spell. Yet I had sworn, before those kisses fell Like winter on me, black as broken jet, An occult blackness like the Prince of Hell, A woman's hand had brushed my faceâand yet, A bat it might have been made mad with wind and wet. VII And stark I stood among the sodden stones, Icy with fever, hearing in each gale Strange footsteps,âwhile within my soul were moans For strength,âas powerless as I was pale. Then I remembered that within a tale Once I had readâa chronicle of ills Cowled monks had writtenâhow one shall not fail To find, unsought, the Fiend, if so he wills, Cloak, cap, and cock's crook'd plume among the lonely hills. VIII Was that his laugh? and that his vulture hand?â No! no! for in the legend it was said, âThough moonless midnight curse the barren land Sathanas' shadow follows him as red As Hell's red cauldron is.ââMy terror fled, Remembering this.âHow sad a fool was I To dream Hell's wickedness would bow his head By mine, and parley with me, lie for lie, With cunning scrutiny of oblong eye by eye! IX Then, then I feltâher presence! all awake Unto her power that could lift or sink; And her straight eyes controlling, like an ache, My brain that had no mastery to think, Or to perform. And slowly, link on link, She bound me helpless, like an inquisitor, In vasty dungeons of the soul; no wink Of light was there, but darkness, bar on bar, Self-convoluted chaos strangling will's high star. X âI am the mother of uneaseful sleep, The child of night and sister of dim death; Who knoweth me, yea, he shall never weep, Yet bless and ban me in a single breath: Who knoweth me a coward is unneth: And saddest hearts have sought me over glad To find gray comfort where the preacher saith There is no comfort. Melancholy mad, Reach me thy hand and know me if thy heart be sad.â XI Thus did she speak. Her voice was like a flame Of burning blackness. Then I felt the throb Of her still hand in mine. And so I came Gladly unto her. Yea, I, too, would rob Time of his triumphs.âWho would groan and sob Beneath his fardels, hearing sad men sigh When here is cure?âfor Life, that, like a lob, Rides us to death; for Love, a godless lie; And Toil and Hunger.âYea, what fool would fear to die? XII Then seemed I wrapped in rolling mists, and, oh, Her arm was round me and her kisses dear On eyes and lips, and words that none may knowâ What words of promise said she in mine ear! Drunk with her beauty still I felt no fear, When, past the forest, like some bounding brute, I heard the river roaring. Drawing near, Again she whispered, and my soul grew mute Before her voice that lulled like music of a lute: XIII âWithin the webs of darkness and of day The spider Hours spin about thy world, Who now finds time to even laugh or pray, Cramped in a term of years that are uncurled Like coils of some huge monster, head uphurled To fang when the last fold falls! Slope on slope The night environs thee with space, empearled With hopeless stars by which men symbol Hope, Beneath whose light they breed and curse and pray and grope.â XIV And so she brought me to the river's brink To plunge me downward. All the night was mine; And so, exulting, to Death's darker drink I stooped and drank.âWhat better drink divine, O man, hast thou? what wiser way is thine? Who find'st me carrion on a hungry coast, Sand in mine eyeballs, in my hair the brine, And o'er my corpse with bitter lips dost boastâ âPoor fool! poor ghost! Alas! poor, melancholy ghost!â A WOMAN OF THE WORLD I As to my soulâ'tis pathos and passion. As to my lifeâ't hath a flavor of sin. What would you have when such is the fashion, Was and will be of the world we are in? Yes, I have loved. And have you?âHave you reckoned The cost of all love?âI can tell you: as much As a soul!âIs it worth it?âYou'll know it that second You know that you love; and God pity all such! II My lover dissembled that ardor's pure beauty. I endured undeceived nor pretended; and gave All that his passion demandedâmy duty, For I loved. And the world?âwhy, I was his slave!â Should it worry I pleased him?âPropriety sorrowed, Uprolling her eyes as occasion, andâwell, That lie, overglossed with a modesty borrowed, Assisted my fall and the end wasâI fell. III Through love? No; the woman! that visible woman Men usually know.âNone knows how we know Of an innermore beauty! that part of the human We designate character.âLook at the bow Of the moon that is new; that bears in its crescent A world.âSo the flesh gleams the slenderest line Of soul; that is love; the unevanescent, Making the mortal immortal, divine. IV Yes; I know what I am. Have outlasted my season Of pleasure and folly.âYou think it is strange That I let you, sayâlove me? But why not?âmy reason Requires illusions. They give me that change Which quiets remembrance. You kiss meâI wonder.â When you say, âYou are beautiful,ââwell, am I glad If I laugh?âYou declaim on my form, âHow no blunder Of nature discords,ââIf I sigh, am I sad? V How you stare at my eyes!âWell! my lips!âmust they languish For kisses to redden?ââMy eyes are as bright As the jewel I drown in my hair, with its anguish Of tortuous fire that quivers to-nightâ? Tears may be.âThis showy?âThat silly white flower Were better?âFor me its simplicity? no!â The gem I prefer to the lily.âThe hour Has struck: I am ready: my fan: let us go. A GUINEVERE Sullen gold down all the sky; Roses and their sultry musk; Whippoorwills deep in the dusk Yonder sob and sigh.â You are here; and I could weep, Weep for joy and suffering. . . . âWhere is heâ?âHe'd have me singâ There he sits, asleep. Think not of him! he is dead For the moment to us twainâ Hold me in your arms again, Rest on mine your head. âAm I happy?â ask the fire When it bursts its bounds and thrills Some mad hours as it wills If those hours tire. He had gold. As for the restâ Well you know how they were set, Saying that I must forget And 'twas for the best. I forget?âBut let it go!â Kiss me as you used of old. There; your kisses are not cold! Can you love me so? Knowing what I am to him, To that gouty gray one there, On the wide verandah, where Fitful fireflies swim. Is it tears? or what? that wets Eyes and cheeks;âon brow and lip Kisses! soft as bees that sip Sweets from violets. See! the moon has risen; white As this open lily here, Rocking on the dusky mere, Like a silent light. Let us walk . . . So soon to part!â All too soon! But he may miss. Give me but another kissâ It will heat my heart And the bitter winter there.â So; we part, my Launcelot, My true knight! and am I not Your true Guinevere? Oft they parted thus, they tell, In that mystical romance . . . Were they placed, think you, perchance, For such love, in Hell? No! it can not, can not be! Love is God, and God is love: And they live and love above, Guinevere and he. I must go now.âSee! there fell, Molten into purple light, One wild star. Kiss me good night, And once more. Farewell. PERLE DES JARDINS What am I, and what is he, Who can take and break a heart, As one might a rose, for sport, In its royalty? What am I that he has made All this love a bitter foam Blown about the wreck-filled gloam Of a soul betrayed? He who of my heart could make Hollow crystal, where his face, Like a passion, had its place, Holy, and then break! Shatter with neglect and sneers!â But these weary eyes are dry, Tearless clear; and if I die They shall know no tears. But my soul weeps. Let it weep! Let it weep, and let the pain In my heart and in my brain Cry itself to sleep.â Ah! the afternoon is warm; And the fields are green and fair; Many happy creatures there Through the woodland swarm. All the summer land is still, And the woodland stream is dark Where the lily rocks its barque Just below the mill. . . . If they found me icy there 'Mid the lilies, and pale whorls Of the cresses in my curls, Wet, of raven hair!â Poor Ophelia! are you such? Would you have him thus to know That you died of utter woe And despair o'ermuch? No!âsuch acts are obsolete: Other things we now must learn:â Though the broken heart will burn, Let it show no heat. So I'll write him as he wrote, Coldly, with no word of scornâ He shall never know a thorn Rankles here! . . . Now note:â âYou'll forget,â he says; âand I Feel 'tis better for us twain: It may give you some small pain, But, 'twill soon be by. âYou are dark and Maud is light. I am dark. And it is said Opposites are better wed.â So I think I'm right.â âYou are dark and Maud is fairâ!â I could laugh at his excuse If the bitter, mad abuse Were not more than hair! But I'll write him, as if glad, Some few happy wordsâthat might Touch upon some past delight That last year we had. Not one line of broken vows, Sighs or hurtful tearsâunshed! Faithless heartsâfar better dead! Nor a withered rose. But a rose! this rose to wear,â Perle des Jardins, all elate With sweet life and delicate,â When he weds her there. So; 'tis finished. It is wellâ Go, thou rose. I have no tear, Word or kiss for thee to bear, And no woe to tell. Only be thus full of life, Cold and proud, dispassionate, Filled with neither love nor hate, When he calls her wife. FACE TO FACE Dead! and all the haughty fate Fair on throat and face of wax, Calm on hands, crossed still and lax, Cold, dispassionate. Dead! and no word whispered low At the dull ear now would wake One responsive chord or make One wan temple glow. Dead! and no hot tear would stir Aught of woman, sweet and fair, Woman soul in feet and hair, Once that smiled in her. She is dead, oh God! and Iâ I must live! though life be but One long, hard, monotonous rut For me till I die. Creeds might help in such a case: But no sermon could have wrought More of faith than you have taught With your pale dead face. Now I see, oh, now I see My mistake!âso very small, Yet so great it bungled all, All for you and me. Oft I said, âI feel, I'm sure She could never live that life! She is still my own true wife, She is good and pure!â You were pure and I bemoiled! That you loathed me, it was just; Weak of soul and left of lust Vulgar, low, and soiled. . . . Closedâthe eyes once filled with dreams! Great, proud eyes! . . . I see them yet, Miniature nights of lucid jet Filled with starry gleams. Sealedâthe lips; poor, faded lips! Once as red as life could makeâ Sweet wild roses, half awake, Dewy to their tips. Hair!âimperial still, and warm As a Grace's; where one stone, Jeweled, lay ensnared and shone Like a star in storm. Eyes!âat parting big with pain . . . God! I see them still! the tear In them!âbig as eyes of deer Led by lights and slain. . . . Woman true, I falsely blamed; Whom I killed with scorn and pride; Woman pure, of whom I lied; With the nameless named: All you said, Sweet, has come true!â Ah! this life had woe enough For the little dole of love Giv'n to me and you. Do you hear me? do you know What I feel now? how it came? You, beyond me like a flame, You, before me like the snow. . . . Dead! and all my heart's a cup Hollowed for repentant tears, Bitter in the bitter years, Slowly brimming up. Peace! 'tis well! But might have been Better.âYes, God's time makes right!â Better for me in His sight With my soul washed clean. Do you hear me? do you know How my heart was all your own? How my life is left alone Now with naught but woe? Peace! be still!âI kiss your hair. Sweet, good-by. Upon your breast Let this long white lily restâ God will find it there: There beyond the sad world and Clouds and stars and silent skies, Where your eyes shall meet His eyes, AndâHe'll understand. THE EVE OF ALL-SAINTS I This is the tale they tell Of an Hallowe'en; This is the thing that befell Me and the village belle, Beautiful Amy Dean. II Did I love her? God and she, They know and I! Ah, she was the life of meâ Whatever else may be Would God that I could die! III That Hallowe'en was dim; The frost lay white Under strange stars and a slim Moon in the graveyard grim, Pale with its slender light. IV They told her: âGo alone, With never a word, To the burial-plot's unknown Grave with the oldest stone, When the clock on twelve is heard. V âThree times around it pass, With never a sound; Each time a wisp of grass And myrtle pluck; then pass Out of the ghostly ground. VI âAnd the bridegroom that's to be, At smiling wait, With a face like mist to see, With graceful gallantry Will bow you to the gate.â VII She laughed at this and so Bespoke us how To the burial-place she'd go.â And I was glad to know, For I'd be there to bow. VIII An acre from the farm The village dead Lay walled from sun and storm; Old cedars, of priestly form, Waved darkly overhead. IX I loved; but never could say The words to her; And waited, day by day, Nursing the hope that lay Under the doubts that were.â X She passed 'neath the iron arch Of the legended ground;â And the moon, like a twisted torch, Burned over one lonesome larch;â She passed with never a sound. XI Three times the circle traced; Three times she bent To the grave that the myrtle graced; Three timesâthen softly faced Homeward and slowly went. XII Had the moonlight changed me so? Or fear undone Her stepping soft and slow? Did she see and did not know? Or loved she another one? XIII Who knows?âShe turned to flee With a face so white It haunts and will haunt me:â The wind blew gustily: The graveyard gate clanged tight. XIV Did she think it I orâwhat, Clutching her dress? Her face so wild that not A star in a stormy spot Shows half so much distress. XV I spoke; but she answered naught. âAmy,â I said, â'Tis I!ââas her form I caught . . . Then laughed like one distraught, For the beautiful girl was dead! . . . XVI This is the tale they tell Of that Hallowe'en; This is the thing that befell Me and the village belle, Beautiful Amy Dean. MATER DOLOROSA The nuns sing, âOra pro nobis;â The casements glitter above; And the beautiful Virgin, whose robe is Woven of infinite love, Infinite love and sorrow, Prays for them there on highâ Who has most need of her prayers,âto-morrow Shall tell them!âthey or I? Up in the hills together We loved, where the world was true; Our world of the whin and heather, Our skies of a nearer blue; A blue from which one borrows A faith that helps one dieâ O Mother, thou Mother of Sorrows, None needs such more than I! We lived, we loved unweddedâ Love's sin and its shame that slays!â No ill of the years we dreaded, No day of their coming days; Their coming days, their many Trials by noon and nightâ And I know no land, not any Where the sun shines half so bright. Was he false to me, my Mother! Or I to him, my God!â Who gave thee right, O brother! To take God's right and rod! God's rod of avenging morrowsâ And the life here in my side!â O Mother, sweet Mother of Sorrows, Would that I, too, had died! By the wall of the Chantry kneeling I pray, and the organ rings, âGloria! gloria!â pealing, âSancta Maria!â sings. They will find us dead to-morrow By the wall of their nunneryâ O Mother, thou Mother of Sorrow, His unborn babe and me. LOVE AS IT WAS IN THE TIME OF LOUIS XIV I Thrice on the lips and twice on the eyes I kiss you or ever I kiss your bosom.â When love is young would you have it wise, Wise as the world goes?âNo! 'tis a blossom Lovely and wise since it's lovely; content To live or to die as its folly pleases: Life is a rose and the rose's scent Is love, that grows as the rose increases. II If I tell you the Marquis will die, will you smile? And laugh when he's dead?âThis powder, my lily, That seems but an innocent sweet in this phialâ Do not touch it! breathe distant!âa poison Exili Used a life to discover. Its formula left To a pupil (well worthy the master!), the prudent And pious Sainte Croix. Him, of teacher bereft, The Devil, I deem, must have taken as student. III Quite a dealer in death. And ours was a case That those difficult drugs of his laboratory Demanded. I visited; found him; his face, Bent over a sublimate,âsafe from the hoary Light particles,âmasked with a mask of fine glass. I told him your danger, Marie, and expounded Our passion, despair, with many an âAlas!â He smiled while a paste in a mortar he pounded. IV Three fistfuls of Louis!ââHe'd do it,â he said.â A delicate dust, gum, liquid and metal Crushed, crucibled. . . . âStay! tie this mask on your head. You see, but a grain on your rose's pink petal Has shriveled and blasted itâlook, how it dries!â A perilous pulver . . . could Satan make better? . . . To mix with that present of perfumesâshe dies, And who is the wiser? Or, say in a letter V âTo the husband of her who has smiled on you since Another grows bald?ââAnd he poured in a bottle The subtlety.ââBah! be he beggar or prince, If he kiss but the seal the venom will throttle.ââ âWell,â I thought, âI will test ere I risk.â Slyly drew My dagger; approached to the bandlet, that tightly Supported his mask, its keen point. . . . It was true!â When it cracked he fell dead; he but breathed of it lightly. VI Your letter is sealed and is sent. You are mine!â By now he has broken the wax. . . . If there flutters Some dust in his nostrils, who, who will divine That thus it was poisoned?âOur alchemist utters No word!âYou are happy? and I?âOh, I feel That I love and am loved.âThe tidings comes heavy To-night to the King; you are there; you will reelâ Will faint!âNow away to the royal levee. Note.âIn this poem, which originally appeared in a volume of mine entitled Lyrics and Idylls, published in 1890, some hypercritical critic in the New York Nation accused me of imitating Browning's The Laboratory. The truth of the matter is that the poem was written ten months before I had ever read Browning's Dramatic Lyrics, and was suggested to me by the reading of the following passage in one of E. T. W. Hoffman's (the German Poe's) stories. The passage occurs in Mademoiselle De Scuderi and is as follows: âThe poisons which Sainte Croix prepared were of so subtle a nature that if the powder (called by the Parisians Poudre de Succession, or Succession Powder) were prepared with the face exposed, a single inhalation of it might cause instantaneous death. Sainte Croix therefore, when engaged in its manufacture, always wore a mask of fine glass. One day, just as he was pouring a prepared powder into a phial, his mask fell off, and inhaling the fine particles of the poison, he fell dead on the spot.â THE TROUBADOUR He stood where all the rare voluptuous west, Like some mad MÃ¦nad, wine-stained to the breast, Laughed with delirious lips of ruby must, Wherein, it seemed, the fierceness of all lust Burnt like a feverish wine, exultant whirled High in a golden goblet, gem-impearled. And all the west, and all the amorous west, Caressed his beauty, dreamed upon his breast; And there he bloomed, a thing of rose and snows, A passion-flower of men of snowy rose, Beneath the casement of her old red tower, Whereat the lady sat, as fair a flower As ever bloomed in Provence; and the lace Mist-like about her hair, half-hid her face And the emotions that his singing raised, So that he knew not if she blamed or praised. And where the white rose, climbing over and over Up to her wide-flung lattice, like a lover, And stalks of lavender and fleurs-de-lis Held honey-cups up for the violent bee, Within her garden by the ivied wall, Where many a fountain, falling musical, Flamed rubies in the eve against it flung, Like some wild nightingale the minstrel sung:â âThe passion, oh, of gently smoothing through Long locks of brown, soft hands as lovers do! Thy dark, deep locks, rich-jeweled as the dusk Is scintillant with stars! Oh, frenzy rare Of clasping slender fingers round thy hair!â What balm, what breath of winds from summer seas! What silken softness and what sorceries Doth it contain!âAh God! ah God! to lie Wrapped strand on strand deep in thy hair and die! Ay me, oh, ay! âOh, happy madness and, oh, rapturous pain, With white hands smoothing back thy locks, to drain Into thine eyes my soul!âOh, perilous eyes! As agates polished; where the thoughts that rise, Within thy heart are imaged; thoughts that pass As magic pictures in a witch's glass.â What siren sweetness, wailed to lyres of gold, What naked beauty that the Greeks of old, God-bosomed, through the bursting foam did see, Could sway my soul with half their mastery! Ay, ay, ay me! âFar o'er the sea, of old time, once a witch, The fair ÃÃ¦an, Circe, dwelt; so rich In marvellous magic, she was like a god, And made or unmade mortals with a nod: Turned all her lovers into bird or brute.â More cruel thou, who mak'st my heart a lute, That lies before thee, hushed and sadly mute! Who let'st it lie, yet from its soul might draw More magic music than Acrasia, Or Circe knew, that filled them with its bliss, Didst thou but take me to thine arms and kiss! Ay, ay, I wis!â Knee-deep amid the dews, the flowers there, Beneath the stars that now were everywhere Flung through the perfumed heavens of angel hands, And, linked in tangled labyrinths and bands Of soft rose-hearted flame and glimmer, rolled One vast immensity of mazy gold, He sang; like some hurt creature, desolate, Heart-aching for the loss of some wild mate Hounded and speared to death of heartless men In old romantic Arden waste; and then Turned to the moon that, like a polished stone Of precious worth, low in the heaven shone, A pale poetic face and passed away From the urned terrace and the fountains' spray. And that fair lady in dim drapery, High in the old red towerâdid she sigh To see him fading through the purple night, His lute faint-twinkling in th' uncertain light, Then lost amid the rose-pleached avenues, Dark walls of ivy, hedged with low-clipped yews? And left alone with but the whispering rush Of fountains and the evening's hyacinth hush, Did she complain unto the stars above, All the lone night, of that forbidden love? Or down the rush-strewn stairs, where arras old Waved with her mantled passage, fold on fold, Beyond the tower's iron-studded gate, That snarled with rust, did she steal forth and wait Deep in the dingled lavender and rose For him, her troubadour? . . . . Who knows? who knows? MY ROMANCE If it so befalls that the midnight hovers In mist no moonlight breaks, The leagues of the years my spirit covers, And my self myself forsakes. And I live in a land of stars and flowers, White cliffs by a silver sea; And the pearly points of her opal towers From the mountains beckon me. And I think that I know that I hear her calling From a casement bathed with lightâ Thro' music of waters in waters falling 'Mid palms from a mountain height. And I feel that I think my love's awaited By the romance of her charms; That her feet are early and mine belated In a world that chains my arms. But I break my chains and the rest is easyâ In the shadow of the rose, Snow-white, that blooms in her garden breezy, We meet and no one knows. We dream sweet dreams and kiss sweet kisses; The worldâit may live or die! The world that forgets; that never misses The life that has long gone by. We speak old vows that have long been spoken, And weep a long-gone woe,â For you must know our hearts were broken Hundreds of years ago. THE EPIC âTo arms!â the battle bugles blew. The daughter of their Chief was she,â Lord of a thousand spears and true;â He but a squire of low degree. The horns of war blew up to horse: He kissed her mouth; her face was white: âGod grant they bear thee back no corse!â âGod give I win my spurs to-night!â The watch-towers' blazing beacons scarred With blood-red wounds the face of night: She heard men gallop battleward; She saw their armor gleam with light. âMy God, deliver me and mine! My child! my love!ââall night she prayed: She watched the battle beacons shine; She watched the battle beacons fade. . . . They brought him on a bier of spears.â For him, the death-won spurs and name; For her, the grief of lonely years, And donjon walls to hide her shame. THE MINSTREL AND THE PRINCESS I He had no hope to win her hand, A harper in a loveless land, And yet he sang of love; And marked the blue vein of her throat Swell with mute rage at every note: And when he ceased she spake him then,â âSuch whining slaves are less than men!â And anger in her dark eyes wrote Contempt thereof. II He had no hope to win her hand, A harper in a hostile land, And yet he sang of peace; And marked how mock'ry curled her lip With scorn as, 'neath each finger-tip, The chords breathed pastoral content: Till haughtiness, that beauty lent To beauty, sneered, âWould'st feel the whip?â O fool, surcease!â III He had no hope to win her hand, A harper in a tyrant's land, And so he sang of warâ âOh, fling thy harp away!â she said. âO war, thy singers are not dead!â Seat thee beside me; now I see Thou art for battle, and must be Brave as thy song.âWell hast thou pled. My warrior!â THE ALCALDE'S DAUGHTER The times they had kissed and parted That night were over a score; Each time that the cavalier started, Each time she would swear him o'er:â âThou art going to Barcelona!â To make Naxera thy bride! Seduce the Lady Iona!â And thy lips have lied! have lied! âI love thee! I love thee, thou knowest! And thou shalt not give away The love to my life thou owest; And my heart commands thee stay! âI say thou hast lied and liest!â Forâwhere is there war in the State?â Thou goest, by Heaven the highest! To choose thee a fairer mate. âWilt thou go to Barcelona When thy queen in Toledo is?â To wait on the haughty Iona, When thou hast these lips to kiss?â And they stood in the balcony over The old Toledo square; And, weeping, she took for her lover A red rose out of her hair. And they kissed farewell; and, higher, The moon made amber the air;â And she drew, for the traitor and liar, A stiletto out of her hair. . . . When the night-watch lounged through the quiet With the stir of halberds and swords, Not a bravo was there to defy it, Not a gallant to brave with words. One man, at the corner's turning, Quite dead, in a moonlight bandâ In his heart a dagger burning, And a red rose crushed in his hand. ISHMAEL Ishmael, the Sultan, in the Ramadan, Amid his guards, bristling with yataghan, And kris,âhis amins, viziers wisdom-gray, Pachas and Marabouts, betook his way Through Mekinez. For he had read the word That in the Koran says, âSlay! praying the Lord! Pray! slaying the victims!â so the Sultan went Straight to the mosque, his mind on battle bent. In white burnoose and sea-green caftan clad He entered ere the last muezzin had Summoned the faithful unto prayer and let The âAllah Akbarâ from the minaret Invite to worship. 'Neath the lamps' lit gold The many knelt and prayed. Upon the old Mosaics of the mosqueâwhose high vault steamed With aloes' incenseâlean ecstatics dreamed Of Allah and his Prophet, and how great Is God, and how unstable man's estate. Conviction on him in this chanting low Of Koran texts, the Caliph's passion so Exalted soaredâlamped by religious aweâ Himseemed he heard God's everlasting law 'Gainst unbelievers; and himself confessed The Faith's anointed sword; and, so impressed, Arose and spoke. The arabesques aboveâ The marvellous work of oriental loveâ Seemed, with new splendors of Heaven's blue and gold, Applauding all. And, ere the gates were rolled, Ogival, back to let the many forth, War was declared on all the Christian Earth. Now had his army passed the closed bazaar, Thro' narrow streets gorged with the streams of war: Had passed the place of tombs and reached the wall Of Mekinez, above which,âover all Its merloned battlements,âin long array, Seraglios and towers, his palace gray Could still be seen when, girt with pomp and state, The Sultan passed the city's scolloped gate. Two dozing beggars, each one's face a sore, Sprawl'd in the sun the city's gate before; A leprous cripple and a thief, whose eyesâ Burnt out with burning ironâas supplies The law for thievesâwere wounds, fly-swarmed and raw,â Lifted shrill voices as they heard or saw; Praised God, and bowed into the dust each face, With words of âvictory and Allah's grace Attend our Caliph, Mouley-Ishmael! Even at the cost of ours his day be well!â And grimly smiling as he grimly passed, âWhile Allah's glory is and still shall lastâ Now by Es Sirat!âwill a leper's word And thief's avail to help us?âBy my sword!â Yea, let us see. Whatever their intent Even as 'tis offered let their necks be bent! 'Though words be pious, evil at the soul The prayer is naught!âSo let their prayer be whole. Better than gold is death, meseems, for these: So by the hands of you, my Soudanese, They die,â he said; and even as he said Rolled in the dust each writhing, withered head. And frowning westward, as the day grew late, Two bleeding heads stared from the city gate 'Neath this inscription for the passer-by, âThere is no virtue but in God most high.â IN MYTHIC SEAS Beneath great saffron stars and skies, dark-blue, Among the Cyclades, a happy two, We sailed; and from the Siren-haunted shore, All mystic in its mist, the soft wind bore The Siren's song; where, on the ghostly steeps, Strange foliage grew, deeps folding upon deeps, That hung and beamed with blossom and with bud, Blue-petaled, pallid, or, like urns of blood, Dripping; or blowing from wide mouths of blooms On our hot brows cool gales of dim perfumes. While from the yellow stars, that splashed the skies, O'er our light shallop brooded mysteries Of calm and sleep, until the yellower moon Rose, full of fire, above a dark lagoon; And, as she rose, the nightingales, on sprays Of heavy, Persian roses, burst in praise Of her wild loveliness; their boisterous pain Heard through the pillars of a ruined fane. And round our lazy keel, that dipped to swing, The spirits of the foam came whispering; And from gray Neptune's coral-columned caves The wet OceÃ¤nids rose through the waves; With naked limbs we saw them breast the spray, Their pearl-white bodies tempesting the way; Their sea-green hair, tossed streaming to the breeze, Scattering with brightness all the tumbled seas. 'Mid columned aisles, seen vaguely through the trees, We watched the Satyrs chase the Dryades; Heard Pan's shrill trebles and the Triton's horn Sound from the flying foam when ruddy Morn, With dewy eyelids, opened azure eyes, And, blushing, rose, and left her couch of skies. We saw the Naiad, clothed with veiling mist, Half hidden in a bay of amethyst, With shell-like breasts, and at her hollow ear A shell's pink labyrinth held up to hear Circean echoes of the Siren's strains Imprisoned in its chords of vermeil veins: Then, stealing wily from a grove of pines, The Oread, in cincture of green vines; Her cautious feet, fragrant and twinkling wet, Set in a bed of rainy serpolet; Her flower-red lips half-parted in surprise, And expectation in her wondering eyes, As in the bosk a rustling noise she hearsâ A Faun, sly-eyed, with furred and pointed ears, Who leaps upon her, as upon a dove A great hawk pinions from the skies above. Diana sees, and on her wooded hills Stays her fair band, the stag-hounds' clamor stillsâ A senseless statue of cold, weeping stone Fills his embrace; the Oread is gone. The stag-hounds bay; again they urge the chase, While the astonished Faun's bewildered face Paints all his wonderment, and, wondering, He bends above the sculpture of a spring. And so we sailed; and many a morn of balm Led on the hours of sunny song and calm: And it was life, to her and me, and love, With the fair myths below, our God above, To sail in golden sunsets and emerge In golden morns upon a fretless surge. But, ah! alas! the stars, that pierce the blue, Shine not for ever; clouds must gather, too. I knew not how it came, but in a while I found myself cast on a desert isle, Alone with sorrow; wan with doubt and dread; The seas in wrath and thunder overhead; Deep down in coral caves the one I loveâ No myths below; no God, it seemed, above. LOKÃ AND SIGYN A daughter of Winter, Skade, a giantess, One twisting serpent hung above his head, So that its blistering venom, roping down, Beat on his upturned face and tortured him. Him had the gods of Asgard, Odin and Thor, Weary of all his wiles and evil ways, Followed, and after many stormy moons, Within the land of giants overcome, In Jotunheim, and dragged beneath the world, Into a cave the earthquake's hands had built, A cavern vast and terrible as that, They tell of Hel's, whose ceiling is of snakes, That hang, a torrent torture, yawning slime, In whose slow stream eternal anguish wades. And for his crimes they chained him to a rock, His lips still sneering and his eyes all scorn, And left him with the serpent over him, And, gathering round him from their larvÃ¦ lairs, Monsters, huge-warted, eyed with wells of fire. But Sigyn, LokÃ©'s wife, stole in to him, And sate herself beside his writhen limbs, And held a cup of gold against the mouth Of ceaseless poison dripping in the gloom. Was it her voice lamenting? or the sound Of far abysmal waters falling, falling Down tortured labyrinths of hollow rock? Or was't the StrÃ¶mkarl? he whose hoary harp Is heard remote; who, syllabling strange runes, Sits gray behind the crashing cataract, Within a grotto dim with mist and foam; His long thin beard, white as the flying spray, Slow-swinging in the wind and keeping time To his wild harp's notes, murmuring, whispering Beneath the talons of his hands of foam. Was it the voice of Sigyn? whose sad sound Soft from the deathless hush detached itself, As some pale star from darkness that reveals The heavens in its fall; or but the deeps Of silence speaking to the deeps of night? Sad, sad, and slow, yea slower than sad tears That fall from blinded eyes, her sad words fell:â âO Love! O LokÃ©! turn on me thine eyes! Thy motionless eyes that woe has changed to stone; That slumber will not seal nor any dream. Yea, I will woo her down; woo Slumber down, From her fair far-off skies, with some old song, The croonÃ©d syllables of some refrain, Sung unto childhood by the mothers of men. Or shall I soothe thine eyes shut with my hair, The fluttered amber of deep curls, until They shall forget their stone stolidity, And sleep creep in between the linÃ©d lids And summon memory and pain away? âPale, pale thy face, that seems to stain the night With pallor; hueless as the brows of death. So pale, that knew we Death, as mortals know, I'd say that he, mysterious, had laid hands Of talons on thee and had left thee so. So still! and all the night is in my heart. So tired! and sleep is not for thee or me, Never again for our o'erweary limbs! Around, the shadows crouch; vague, obscene shapes, In horrible attitudes; and all the night, Above, below, seems so much choking fog, That clogs my tongue, or with devouring maw Swallows my words and makes them sound far off, Remote, deep down, emboweled of the Earth. And then again it hounds them from my tongue To sound as wildly clamorous as the hills Sound when Earth shakes with armies; men that meet With Berserk fury, shouting, and the hurl And shock of iron spears on iron shields, And all the world is one wild wave of helms, And all the air is one wild wind of swords, On which the wild Valkyries ride and scream. Dread cliffs, dread chasms of rocks howl back my words While yet they touch the tongue to grasp the thought; And all the vermin, huddled in their holes, Creep forth to glare and hiss them back again. âHow long! how long ago since we beheld The rose of morning and the lily of noon, The great red rhododendron of the eve! How long! how long ago since we beheld Those thoughts of God, the stars, that set their flowers Imperishably in the fields of heaven, And the still changing yet unchanging moon! So long, that I unto myself seem grown, As thou, long since, to rock; in sympathy With all the rock above us and around. My countenance hath won, long since, with thee, The reflex of an alabaster black That builds vast walls around us, and whose frown Makes stone thy brow as mine. O woe! O woe! And now that Idun's apples are denied, Are not for lips of thee nor lips of me,â The apples of gold that still keep young the gods,â The years shall cleave this beautiful brow of thine With myriad wrinkles; and, in time, this hair, Brown, brown, and softer than the fur of seals, Shall lose its lustre and instead shall lie A drift of winter in a winter cave, A feeble gray seen in the glimmering gloom. But I shall age, too, even as thou dost age. Yet, yet we can not die; the immortal gods Can never die! what punishment to know! What pain to know we age yet can not die! Death will not come except with Ragnarok.â That thought be near! take comfort from the word, The dark word Ragnarok, which is thyself; Thy vast revenge; thy monster synonym; Thy banquet of destruction. Thou, whom fate, The Norns, reserve to war and waste the worlds Of gods and men, with thy two henchmen huge, The wolf and snake, the Fenris, that devours, The Midgard, that engulfs the universe. O joy! O joy! then shall those stars, that glue Their blinking scales unto old Ymer's skull,â The dome of heaven,âshudder from their spheres, A streaming fire; and thou, O LokÃ©, thou, Elected annihilation, shalt arise, To devastate the Earth and Asaheim. And as this darkness now, this heavy night, Clings to and chokes us till we, strangling, strive With purple lips for light, and feel the dark Drag freezing down the throat to swell the weight That houses in our hearts and peoples our veins, So shall thy hate insufferably spread In fires of Hel, in fogs of Niflheim, Storm-like from pole to pole, o'erwhelming all.â The Twilight of the Gods, behold, it comes! The Twilight of the Gods!âThe root-red cock I seem to hear crow in the halls of Hel! The blood-red cock, whose cry shall bid thee rise! âBut, oh! thy face! paler it seemeth now Than icy marble; and the serpent writhes Its rustling coils and twists its livid length, Hissing, above thee, pouring eternal pain.â Oh, could I kiss the lips o'er which he swings! The lips that once touched living flame to mine! At which sweet thought, as some sick flower of drought At dreams of dew, my lips with longing ache! âOh, could I gaze once more into thine eyes Whose starry depths outstarred the midnight heavens! Or see them laugh as golden morning laughs, Leaving her steps in roses on the hills, The peaks that wall the world and pierce the clouds; The hills, where once we stood, among the pines, The melancholy pines that plume the crags, And rock and sing unto the still fiords Like gaunt wild-women lullabying their babes! Then could I die e'en as the mortals die, And smile in dying!âBut the serpent baulks Each effort to behold, or on loved lips To ease the torture of my soul's desire. Thy face alone is comfort to my gaze, Like some dim moon silvering through night and mist. âNow from their lairs again the monsters creep; I feel their ghastly touches, and their eyes Draw steadily nearer, wandering will-o'-the-wisps; The serpent strives to fang me as he swings; And in the cup's caked gold the venom swims, Seethes upward horribly to the horrible edge.â She ceased. And then, heard through the echoing night, The chained god spoke, tumultuous violence And rage in every word. His utterance seemed Large as the thunder when it, rolling, plants,â Heavy with earthquake and impending ruin,â Seismic feet on everlasting seas And mountains silent with eternal ice. His eyes in hideous labor; and his throat, Corded and gnarled with veins of boisterous blood, A crag of fury; and his foaming lips, A maelstrom of rebellious agony, Of thwarted rage and wild, arrested wrath. Fierce vaunter of loud hate, one mighty fist, Convulsed with clenchment, in its gyve of ore, Headlong for battle-launching, at the gods Clutched mad defiance, madder blasphemy; Yet all unhurled and vain as mists of morn, Or foam, wind-wasted on the sterile sands Of rainy seas, when Ran, from whistling caves, Watching the tempest-driven dragon wreck, Already in her miser fingers feels The viking gold that has not yet gone down. Then all the cave again is dumb with night. He sees the spotted serpent writhe above; He sees the poison streaming towards his eyes. And now her cup is brimmed; but one more drop Will float the filth gray o'er the venomed edge. Into the river slowly flowing by Swiftly she pours the vitriol torture: scarce A tithe of time it takes, but in that time The reptile's vomit slimes his helpless face, Burns to the bone. . . . All his fierce muscles twist, Wrenching the knotted steel that locks his limbs, And shriek on shriek divides the solitudes. The ocean roars; and, under toppling skies, The mountains avalanche from pine-pierced sides Their centuries of snow. Then all the night Once more is filled with silence and with sighs. WAR-SONG OF HARALD THE RED And this is the song of battle, they sang to the thrash of the oars, As the prows of their shield-hung dragons were driven along the shores:â On to the battle! Yo ho for the slaughter! Hark to the grind of the oars that thunder! Clash of the prows as they crash through the water, Hurl through the foam of the seas they sunder! Up with the axe! and drive through the bristling Beaks of the foe that our iron has broken! On through the sleet of the shafts that are whistling, Arrows of ash, in a wedge that is oaken. By the eye of Odin! whose frown is war, Think of the vikings' daughters, who wear Gold on their hips! to hale by the hair, Gold-bound, red as the beard of Thor! Virgins, whose bodies, white-bosomed, are For rape and ransom!âA kingdom's ravish Yours! for the sweat and the blood you lavish. Hark! on the shore how his fierce fangs clamor! Ocean's, whose rocks are hungry for carrion:â Ho! 'tis a sound as of swords that hammer Helms to the brazen snarl of the clarion. . . . On to the revel of war, my bullies, Blades, that fury like fire to battle! On to the banquet, through spray that gullies, Bray of the beaks and the oars' wild rattle! When prow grinds prow and the arrows hail, Think! were it better with hollow-eyed Hel To rot with cowards? or boast and yell Hoarse toasts over skulls of the boisterous ale High in Valhalla where heroes dwell? In vast Valhalla, where life wends well! The warrior vault of whose shields with curses Rings to the roar of the Berserk verses! YULE Behold! in the night there was storm; and the rushing of snow and of sleet; And the boom of the sea and the moaning of pines in its desolate beat. And the hall of fierce Erick of Sogn with the clamor of wassail was filled, With the clash of great beakers of gold and the reek of the ale that was spilled. For the Yule was upon them, the Yule; and they quaffed as from skulls of the slain, And shouted loud oaths in hoarse wit, and long quaffing swore laughing again. Unharnessed from each shaggy throat, that was hot with brute lust and with drink, Each burly wild skin and barbaric tossed, rent from the gold of its link. For the Yule was upon them, the Yule, and the waesheils were shouted and roared By the Berserks, the eaters of fire, and the Jarls round the ponderous board. And huge on the hearth, that writhed, hissing, and bellied, an ingot of gold, The Yule-log, the half of an oak from the mountains, was royally rolled. And its warmth and its glory, that glared, smote red through the width of the hall, And burnished the boar-skins and bucklers and war-axes hung on the wall. And the maidens, who hurried big goblets, that bubbled, excessive with barm, Blushed rose to the gold of thick curls as the shining steel mirrored each charm. And Erick's one hundred gray skalds, at the nod and the beck of the king, With the stormy-rolled music of an hundred wild harps made the castle reÃ«choing ring. For the Yule, for the Yule was upon them, and battle and rapine were o'er; And Harald, the viking, the red, and his brother lay dead on the shore. For the harrier, Harald the red, and his merciless brother, black Ulf, With their men on the shore of the wintery sea were carrion cold for the wolf. Behold! for the battle was ended; the battle that clamored all day, With the rumble of shields that were shocked and of spears that were splintered like spray: With the hewing of swords that fierce-lightened like flames and that smoked with hot blood, And the crush of the mace that was hammered through helm and through brain that withstood: And the cursing and howling of men at their gods,âat their gods whom they cursed, Till the caves of the ocean re-bellowed and storm on their battling burst. And they fought; in the flying and drifting and silence of covering snow, Till the wounded that lay with the dead, with the dead were stiff frozen in woe. And they fought; and the mystical flakes that were clutched by the maniac wind Drave sharp on the eyes of the kings, made the sight of their warriors blind. Still they fought; and with leonine wrath were they met, till the battle-god, Thor, In his thunder-wheeled chariot rolled, making end of destruction and war. And they fellâlike twin rocks of the mountains, or pines, that rush, hurricane-hurled, From their world-rooted crags to the ocean below with the wreck of the world. But, lo! not in vain their loud vows! on the black iron altars of War Not in vain as victims, the warriors, their blood as libation to Thor! . . . Lo! a glitter and splendor of arms through the snow and the foam of the seas And the terrible ghosts of the vikings and the gauntleted Valkyries! . . . Yea, the halls of fierce Erick of Sogn with the turmoil of wassail are filled, With the steam of the flesh of the boar, and the reek of the ale that is spilled. For the Yule and the victory are theirs, and the waesheils are shouted and roared By the Berserks, the eaters of fire, and the Jarls round the ponderous board. [OLD WORLD IDYLLS] TO R. E. LEE GIBSON And one, perchance, will read and sigh: âWhat aimless songs! Why will he sing Of nature that drags out her woe Through wind and rain, and sun and snow, From miserable spring to spring?â Then put me by. And one, perhaps, will read and say: âWhy write of things across the sea, Of men and women, far and near, When we of things at home would hearâ Well! who would call this poetry?â Then toss away. A hopeless task have we, meseems, At this late day; whom fate hath made Sad, bankrupt heirs of song; who, filled With kindred yearnings, try to build A tower like theirs, that will not fade, Out of our dreams. ACCOLON OF GAUL Prelude O wondrous legends from the storied wells Of lost Baranton! where old Merlin dwells, Nodding a white poll and a grave, gray beard, As if some Lake LadyÃ© he, listening, heard, Who spake like water, danced like careful showers With blown gold curls through drifts of wild-thorn flowers; Loose, lazy arms upon her bosom crossed, An instant seen, and in an instant lost, With one peculiar note, like that you hear Dropped by a reed-bird when the night is near, A vocal gold blown through the atmosphere. Lo! dreams from dreams in dreams remembered. Naught That matters much, save that it seemed I thought I wandered dim with some one, but I knew Not whom; most beautiful, and young, and true, And pale through suffering: with curl-crowned brow Soft eyes and voice, so strange, they haunt me nowâ A dream, perhaps, in dreamland. Seemed that she Led me along a flower-showered lea Trammeled with puckered pansy and the pea; Where poppies spread great blood-red stain on stain, So gorged with sunlight and the honeyed rain Their hearts were weary; roses lavished beams; Roses, wherein were huddled little dreams That laughed coy, sidewise merriment, like dew, Or from fair fingers fragrant kisses blew. And suddenly a river cleft the sward; And o'er it lay a mist: and it was hard To see whence came it; whitherward it led; Like some wild, frightened thing, it foamed and fled, Sighing and murmuring, from its fountain-head. And following it, at last I came upon The Region of Romance,âfrom whence were drawn Its wandering waters,âand the storied wells Of lost Baranton, where old Merlin dwells, Nodding a white poll and a great, gray beard. And then, far off, a woman's voice I heard, Wilder than water, laughing in the bowers, Like some strange bird: and then, through wild-thorn flowers, I saw her limbs glance, twinkling as spring showers; And then, with blown gold curls, tempestuous tossed, White as a wood-nymph, she a vista crossed, Laughing that laugh wherein there was no cheer, But soulless scorn. And so to me drew near Her sweet lascivious brow's white wonderment, And gray, great eyes, and hair which had the scent Of all the wild BrÃ©cÃ¨liande's perfumes Drowned in it; and, a flame in gold, one bloom's Blood-point thrust deep. And, âViviane! Viviane!â The wild seemed crying, as if swept with rain; And all the young leaves laughed; and surge on surge Swept the witch-haunted forest to its verge, That shook and sighed and stammered, as, in sleep, A giant half-aroused: and, with a leap, That samite-hazy creature, blossom-white, Showered mocking kisses down; then, like a light Beat into gusty flutterings by the dawn, Then quenched, she glimmered and, behold, was gone; And in BrÃ©cÃ¨liande I stood alone Gazing at Merlin, sitting on a stone; Old Merlin, charmed there, dreaming drowsy dreams; A wondrous company; as many as gleams That stab the moted mazes of a beech. And each grave dream, behold, had power to reach My mind through magic; each one following each In dim procession; and their beauty drew Tears down my cheeks, and Merlin's gray cheeks, too,â One in his beard hung tangled, bright as dew.â Long pageants seemed to pass me, brave and fair, Of courts and tournaments, with silvery blare Of immaterial trumpets high in air; And blazoned banners, shields, and many a spear Of Uther, waved an incorporeal fear: And forms of Arthur rose and Guenevere, Of Tristram and of Isoud and of Mark, And many others; glimmering in the dark Of Merlin's mind, they rose and glared and then,â The instant's fostered phantoms,âpassed again. Then all around me seemed a rippling stir Of silken something,âwilier, lovelier Than that witch-mothered beauty, Viviane,â Approaching with dead knights amid her train, Pale through the vast BrÃ©cÃ¨liande. And then A knight, steel-helmeted, a man of men, Passed with a fool, King Arthur's Dagonet, Who on his head a tinsel crown had set In mockery. And as he went his way, Behind the knight the leaves began to sway, Then slightly partedâand Morgane le Fay, With haughty, wicked eyes and lovely face, Studied him steadily a little space. I âAgain I hold thee to my heart, Morgane; Here where the restless forest hears the main Toss as in troubled sleep. Now hear me, sweet, While I that dream of yesternight repeat.â âFirst let us find some rock or mossed retreat Where we may sit at ease.âWhy dost thou look So serious? Nay! learn lightness from this brook, And gladness from these flowers, my Accolon. See the wild vista there! where purpling run Long woodland shadows from the sinking sun; Deeper the wood seems there, secluded as The tame wild-deer that, in the moss and grass, Gaze with their human eyes. Where grow those lines Of pale-starred green; and where yon fountain shines, Urned deep in tremulous ferns, let's rest upon Yon oak-trunk by the tempest overthrown Years, years ago. See, how 'tis rotted brown! But here the red bark's firm and overgrown Of trailing ivy darkly berried. Share My throne with me. Come, cast away thy care! Sit here and breathe with me this wildwood air, Musk with the wood's decay that fills each way; As if some shrub, while dreaming of the May, In longing languor weakly tried to wake Its perished blossoms and could only make Ghosts of such dead aromas as it knew, And shape a spectre of invisible dew To haunt these sounding miles of solitude.â âStill, thou art troubled, Morgane! and the mood, Deep in thy fathomless eyes, glows.âCanst not keep Mine eyes from seeing!âDark thy thought and deep As that of some wild woman,âfound asleep By some lost knight upon a precipice,â Whom he hath wakened with a sudden kiss: As that of some frail elfin lady,âlight As are the foggy moonbeams,âfilmy white, Who waves diaphanous beauty on a cliff, That, drowsing, purrs with moon-drenched pines; but if The lone knight follow, foul fiends rise and drag Him crashing down, while she, tall on the crag, Triumphant, mocks him with glad sorcery Till all the wildwood echoes shout with glee.â âFollow thy figure further, Accolon. Right fair it is. Too soon, alas! art done,â Said she; and tossing back her heavy hair, Said smilingly, yet with a certain air Of hurt impatience, âWhy dost not compare This dark expression of my eyes, ah me! To something darker? say, it is to thee As some bewildering mystery of a tarn, A mountain water, that the mornings scorn To anadem with fire and leave gray; To which a champion cometh when the day Hath tired of breding for the twilight's head Flame-petaled blooms, and, golden-chapleted, Sits waiting, rosy with deep love, for night, Who cometh sandaled with the moon; the light Of the auroras round her; her vast hair Tortuous with stars,âthat burn, as in a lair The eyes of hunted wild things glare with rage,â And on her bosom doth his love assuage.â âYea, even so,â said Accolon, his eyes Searching her face: âthe knight, as I surmise, Who cometh heated to that haunted place, Stoops down to lave his forehead, and his face Meets fairy faces; elfins in a ring That shadow upward, smiling, beckoning Down, down to wonders, magic built of old For some dim witch.âA city walled with gold, With beryl battlements and paved with pearls; Its lambent towers wrought of foamy swirls Of alabaster; and that witch to love More beautiful than any queen above.â He pauses, troubled: but a wizard power, In all his bronzen harness, that mad hour Plunges himâwhither? What if he should miss Those cloudy beauties and that creature's kiss?â Ah, Morgane, that same power Accolon Found potent in thine eyes, and it hath drawn And plunged himâwhither? yea, to what far fate? To what dim end? what veiled and future state?â With shadowy eyes long, long she gazed in his, Then whispered dreamily the one word, âBliss.â And like an echo on his sad mouth sate The answer:ââBliss?âdeep have we drunk of late! But death, I feel, some stealthy-footed death Draws near! whose claws will clutch awayâwhose breath? . . . I dreamed last night thou gather'dst flowers with me, Fairer than those of earth. And I did see How woolly gold they were, how woven through With fluffy flame, and webby with spun dew: And âAsphodelsâ I murmured: then, âThese sure Are Eden amaranths, so angel pure That love alone may touch them.ââThou didst lay The flowers in my hands; alas! then gray The world grew; and, meseemed, I passed away. In some strange manner on a misty brook, Between us flowing, striving still to look Beyond it, while, around, the wild air shook With torn farewells of pensive melody, Aching with tears and hopeless utterly; So merciless near, meseemed that I did hear That music in those flowers, and yearned to tear Their ingot-cored and gold-crowned hearts, and hush Their voices into silence and to crush: Yet o'er me was a something that restrained: The melancholy presence of two pained And awful, burning eyes that cowed and held My spirit while that music died or swelled Far out on shoreless waters, borne awayâ Like some wild-bird, that, blinded with the ray Of dawn it wings tow'rds, lifting high its crest, The glory round it, sings its heavenliest, When suddenly all's changed; with drooping head, Daggered of thorns it plunged on, fluttering, dead, Still, still it seems to sing, though wrapped in night, The slow blood beading on its breast of white.â And then I knew the flowers which thou hadst given Were strays of parting grief and waifs of heaven For tears and memories. Importunate They spoke to me of loves that separate!â But, God! ah God! my God! thus was I left! And these were with me who was so bereft. The haunting torment of that dream of grief Weighs on my soul and gives me no relief.â He bowed and wept into his hands;and she, Sorrowing beheld. Then, resting at her knee, Raised slow her oblong lute and smote some chords. But ere the impulse saddened into words, Said: âAnd didst love me as thy lips would prove, No visions wrought of sleep might move thy love. Firm is all love in firmness of his power; With flame, reverberant, moated stands his tower; So built as not to admit from fact a beam Of doubt, and much less of a doubt from dream: All such th' alchemic fire of love's desires,â That moats its tower with flame,âturns to gold wires To chord the old lyre new whereon he lyres.â She ceased; and then, sad softness in her eye, Sang to his dream a questioning reply:â âWill love be less, when dead the roguish Spring, Who, with white hands, sowed violets, whispering? When petals of her cheeks, wan-wasted through Of withering grief, are laid beneath the dew, Will love be less? âWill love be less, when comes the Summer tall? Her throat a lily, long and spiritual: When like a poppied swath,âhushed haunt of bees,â Her form is laid in slumber on the leas, Will love be less? âWill love be less, when Autumn, sighing there, Droops with long frost streaks in her dark, dark hair? When her grave eyes are closed to heaven above, Deep, lost in memory's melancholy, love, Will love be less? âWill love be less, when Winter at the door Shakes from gray locks th' icicles, long and hoar? When Death's eyes, hollow o'er his shoulder, dart Dark looks that wring with tears, then freeze the heart, Will love be less?â And in her hair wept softly, and her breast Rose and was wet with tearsâas when, distressed, Night steals on day, rain sobbing through her curls.â âThough tears become thee even as priceless pearls, Weep not, Morgane.âMine no gloom of doubt, But grief for sweet love's death I dreamed about,â He said. âMay love, the flame-anointed, be Lord of our hearts, and king eternally! Love, ruler of our lives, whose power shall cease No majesty when we are laid at peace; But still shall reign, when souls have loved thus well, Our god in Heaven or our god in Hell.â So they communed. Afar her castle stood, Its slender towers glimmering through the wood: A forest lodge rose, ivy-buried, near A woodland vista where faint herds of deer Stalked like soft shadows: where, with many a run, Mavis and throstle caroled in the sun: And where through trees was seen a surf-white shore. For this was Morgane's realm, embowered Gore; And that her castle, sea-built Chariot, That rooky pile, where, she a while forgot Urience, her husband, now at Camelot. Hurt in that battle where King Arthur strove With the Five Heathen Kings, and, slaying, drove The Five before him, Accolon was borne To a gray castle on his shield one morn;â A castle like a dream, set high in scorn Above the world and all its hungry herds, Belted with woods melodious with birds, Far from the rush of spears and roar of swords, And the loud shields of battle-bloody lords, And fields of silent slain where Havoc sprawled Gorged to her eyes with carnage.âDim, high-halled, And hushed it rose; and through the granite-walled Huge gate, and court, up stairs of marble sheen, Six damsels bore him, tiremaids of a queen, Stately and dark, who moved as if a flame Of starlight shone around her; and who came With healing herbs and searched his wounds. A dame, So radiant in raiment silvery, So white, that she attendant seemed to be On that high Holy Grail, which evermore The Table Round hath sought by wood and shore; The angel-guarded cup of mystery, That but the pure in body and soul may see;â Thus not for him, a worldly one, to love, Who loved her even to wonder; skied above His worship as the moon above the main, That strives and strives to reach her, pale with pain, She with her peaceful, pitiless, virgin cheer Watching his suffering year on weary year.â To Accolon such seemed she: Then, too late, His heart's ideal, merciless as fate! For whom his soul must yearn till death; and wait And dream of; evermore with sighs and tears, Through the long waste of unavailing years, Seeing her ever luminously stand In luminous heavens, beckoning with her hand: Before which vision heart and soul were weak, And dumb with love, that would, yet could not speak.â Her beauty filled him with divine despair. Around his heart she seemed to wrap her hair, Her raven hair, and drag him to his doom; Her looks were splendid daggers in the gloom Of his sick soul, his heart's invaded tower, Stabbing, yet never slaying, every hour. Thus worshiping that queen, Morgane le Fay, For many a day within his room he lay, Longing to live now, then again to die, As now her face, or now her glancing eye, Bade his heart hope, with smiled approval of His passion; now despair, with scorn of love; His love, that dragged itself before her feet, Dog-like, to whom even a blow were sweet. Ah, never dreamed he of what was to be,â Nay, nay! how could he? while the agony Of his unworth possessed his soul so much, He never thought such loveliness and such Perfection ever could stoop from its heaven, Far as his world, and to his arms be given. One night a tempest tore and tossed and lashed The writhing forest, and deep thunders dashed Sonorous shields together; and anon, Vast in the thunder's pause, the sea would groan Like some enormous curse a knight hath lured From where it soared to maim it with his sword. And Accolon, from where he lay, could see The stormy, wide-wrenched night's immensity Yawn hells of golden ghastliness, and sweep Distending foam, tempestuous, up each steep Of raucous iron. In a fever-fit, He seemed to see, on crags the lightning lit, With tangled hair wild-blown, nude mermaids sit, Singing, and beckoning with foam-white arms Some far ship struggling with the strangling storm's Resistless exultation. And there came One breaker, mountained heavenward, all aflame With glow-worm green, that boomed against the cliff Its bulkÃ©d thunderâand there, pale and stiff, Tumbled in eddies of the howling rocks, His dead, drawn face, with lidless eyes, and locks Oozed close with brine; hurled upward streamingly To streaming mermaids. Then he seemed to see The vampire echoes of the hoarse wood, who, With hooting, sought him: down the casement drew Wet, shuddering, hag-like fingers; and, at last, Thronged up the turrets with an elfin blast Of baffled mockery, and whirled wildly off, Back to the forest with a maniac scoff.â Then, far away, hoofs of a hundred gales, As wave rams wave up windy bluffs of Wales, Loosed from the battlemented hills, the loud Herders of tempest drove their herds of cloud, That down the rocking night rolled, with the glare Of swimming eyeballs, and the hurl of hair, Blown, black as rain, from misty-manÃ©d brows, And mouths of bellowing storm; in mad carouse, With whips of wind, rolling and ruining by, Headlong, along the wild and headlong sky. Once when the lightning made the casement glare, Squares touched to gold, athwart it swept her hair, As if a raven's wing had cut the storm Death-driven seaward. And the vague alarm Of her swift coming filled his soul with hope And wild surmise, that winged beyond the scope Of all his dreams had dreamed of, when he saw 'Twas she, the all-adored. He felt no awe When low she kneeled beside him, beautiful As some lone star and white, and said, âTo lull Thy soul to sleep, lo, I have come to thee.â Didst thou not call me?ââ âYea;â he said. âMaybe Thou heard'st my heart, that calls continually: But with my lips I called thee not. But, stay! The night is wild. Thou wilt not go away! The night is wild, and it is long till day! To see thee like a benediction near, To hear thy voice, to have thy cool hand here Smoothing my feverish brow and matted curls; To see thy white throat, whiter than its pearls, Lean o'er me breathing; feel the influence Of thy large eyes, like stars, whose sole defence Against all storm is beauty,âis to see And feel a portion of divinity, My heart's high dream come true, my dream of dreams!ââ Then paused and said, âSee, how the tempest streams! How sweeps the tumult! and the thunder gleams As, when King Arthur charged on battle-fields Of Humber, glared the fiery spears and shields Of all his knights!âwhen the Five Kings went down! In the wild hurl of onset overthrown. . . . But thy white presence, like the moon, has sown This room with calm; and all the storm in me, The tempest of my soul, dies utterly. So let me feel thy hand upon my cheek. And speak! I love thy voice: belovÃ©d, speak.â âThou lov'st a thing of air, fond Accolon! Is thy love then so spiritual? Nay! anon 'T will change, methinks. Whatever may befall, Earth-love, thou 'lt find, is better, after all.ââ She smiled; and, sudden, through the moon-rent wall Of storm, baptizing moonlight, foot and face, Bathed and possessed her, as his soul the grace And sweetness of her smile, whose life was brief, But long enough to heal him of his grief. âNow rest,â she said; âI love thee with much love!â Thou didst not know I loved: but God above, He knew and had divinement.âWinds may blow!â To lie by thee to-night my mind is. So,ââ She laughed,ââsleep well!âFor me . . . give me thy word Of knighthood!âlook thou! . . . and this naked sword Laid here betwixt us! . . . Let it be a wall Strong between love and lust an lov'st me all in all.â Then she unbound the gold that clasped her waist: Undid her hair: and, like a flower faced, Stood sweet an unswayed stem that ran to bud In bloom and beauty of young womanhood. And fragrance was to her as natural As odor to the rose. And white and tall, All ardor and all fervor, through the room She moved, a presence as of pale perfume. And all his eyes and lips and limbs were fire: His tongue, delirious, babbled of desire; Cried, âThine is devil's kindness, which is even Worse than fiend's fury, since the soul sees Heaven Among eternal torments unforgiven. Temptation neighbored, like a bloody rust On a bright blade, leaves ugly stains; and lust Is love's undoing when love's limbs are cast Naked before desire. What love so chaste But that such nearness of what should be hid Makes it a lawless love?âBut thou hast bid. Rest thou. I love thee; love thee as dost know, And all my love shall battle with love's foe.â âThy word,â she said. And pure as peaks that keep Snow-drifted crowns, upon him seemed to sweep An avalanche of virtue in one look. And he, whose very soul within him shook, Exclaimed, â'T is thine!ââAnd hopes, that in his brain Had risen with rainbow gleams, set sad as rain At that high look she gave of chastest pain. Then turned, his face deep in his hands: and she Laid the broad blade between them instantly. And so they lay its iron between them twain: Unsleeping he, for all the brute disdain Of passion in him struggled up and stood A rebel wrangling with the brain and blood. An hour stole by: she slept, or seemed to sleep. The winds of night blew vigorous from the deep With rain-scents of storm-watered wood and wold, And breathed of ocean breakers moonlight-rolled. He drowsed; and time passed stealing as for one Whose life is but a dream in Avalon. Vast bulks of black, wind-shattered rack went by The casement's square of heaven,âa crystal dye, A crown of moonlight, round each cloudy head,â That seemed the ghosts of giant kings long-dead. And then he thought she lightly laughed and sighed, So soft a taper had not bent aside, And leaned her warm face, seen through loosened hair, Above him, whispering, soft as is a prayer, âBehold! the sword! I take the sword away!â It curved and clashed where the strewn rushes lay; Shone glassy, glittering like a watery beam Of moonlight, in the moonlight. He did deem She moved in sleep and dreamed perverse nor wist The thing she did, until two hot lips kissed His wondering eyes to knowledge of her thought. Then said he, âLove, my word! is it then naught?â But now he felt fierce kisses over and over, And laughter of âThy word?âArt thou my lover?â Kisses are more than words!âCome, give them me!â As for thy wordâI give it back to thee!â Sleep is a spirit, who beside us sits, Or through our frames like some dim glamour flits; From out her form a pearly light is shed, As, from a lily in a lily-bed, A firefly's gleam. Her face is pale as stone, Uncertain as a cloud that lies alone In empty heaven; her diaphanous feet Are easy as the dew or opaline heat Of summer meads. With earsâaurora-pink As dawn'sâshe leans and listens on the brink Of being, dark with dreadfulness and doubt, Wherein vague lights and shadows move about, And palpitations beatâlike some huge heart Of Earthâthe surging pulse of which we're part. One hand, that hollows her divining eyes, Glows like the curved moon over twilight skies; And with her gaze she fathoms life and deathâ Gulfs, where man's conscience, like a restless breath Of wind, goes wandering; whispering low of things, The irremediable, where sorrow clings. Around her limbs a veil of woven mist Wavers, and turns from fibered amethyst To textured crystal; through which symboled bars Of silver burn, and cabalistic stars Of nebulous gold. Shrouding her feet and hair, Within this woof, fantastic, everywhere, Dreams come and go: the instant images Of things she sees and thinks; realities, Shadows, with which her heart and fancy swarm, That in the veil take momentary form: Now picturing heaven in celestial fire, And now the hell of every soul's desire; Hinting at worlds, God wraps in mystery, Beyond the world we touch and know and see. No, never,âno!âwould they forget that night.â Too soon the sleepy birds awoke the light! Too soon, for them, trailing gray skirts of breeze, The drowsy dawn came wandering through the trees. âToo soon,â she sighed; and he, âAlas! too soon!â But at their scutcheoned casement, overstrewn Of dew and dreams, the dim wind knocked and cried, âArise! come forth, O bridegroom, and O bride!â II Morn; and the Autumn, dreaming, sat among His ancient hills; Autumn, who now was wrung By crafty ministers, sun, rain, and frost, To don imperial pomp at any cost. On each wild hill he reared his tents of war, Flaunting barbaric standards wide and far, Around which camp-fires of the red leaves raged: His tottering state by flattering zephyrs paged, Who, in a little fretful while, would soon Work red rebellion under some wan moon: Pluck his old beard, deriding; shriek and tear His royalty; and scatter through the air His tattered majesty: then from his head Dash down its golden crown; and in its stead Set up a death's-head mockery of snow, And leave him stripped, a beggar bowed with woe. Blow, wood wind, blow! the day is fair and fine As autumn skies can make it; brisk as brine The air is, rustling in the underbrush, 'Mid which the stag-hounds leap, the huntsmen rush. Hark to the horns! the music of the bows! Ã mort! Ã  mort!âThe hunt is up and goes, Beneath the acorn-dropping oaks, in green,â Dark woodland green,âa boar-spear held between His selle and hunter's head; and at his thigh A good broad hanger; and one hand on high To wind his horn, that startles many a wing, And makes the forest echoes reel and ring. Away, away they flash, a belted band From Camelot, through the haze-haunted land: With many a leamer leashed, and many a hound, With mouths of bell-like music, now that bound, Uncoupled, forward; for, behold! the hart, A ten-tined buck, doth from the covert dart. And the big stag-hounds swing into the chase, The wild horns sing. The pryce seems but a pace On ere 'tis wound. But, see! where interlace The dense-briared thickets, now the hounds have lost The slot, there where their woodland way is crossed By intercepting waters full of leaves. Beyond, the hart a tangled labyrinth weaves Through deeper boscage; and it seems the sun Makes many shadowy stags of this wild one, That lead in different trails the foresters: And in the trees the ceaseless wind, that stirs, Seems some strange witchcraft, that, with baffling mirth, Mocks them the unbayed hart, and fills the earth With rustling sounds of running.âHastening thence, Galloped King Arthur and King Urience, With one small brachet-hound. Now far away They heard their fellowship's faint horns; and day Wore on to noon; yet, there before them, they Still saw the hart plunge bravely through the brake, Leaving the bracken shaking in his wake: And on they followed; on, through many a copse, Above whose brush, close on before, the tops Of the great antlers swelled anon, then, lo, Were gone where beat the heather to and fro. But still they drave him hard; and ever near Seemed that great hart unwearied, and 'twas clear The chase would yet be long, when Arthur's horse Gasped mightily and, lunging in his course, Lay dead, a lordly bay; and Urience Reined his gray hunter, laboring. And thence King Arthur went afoot. When suddenly He was aware of a wide waste of sea, And, near the wood, the hart upon the sward, Bayed, panting unto death and winded hard. So with his sword he slew him; then the pryce Wound loudly on his hunting-bugle thrice. As if each echo, which that wild horn's blast Roused from its sleep,âthe solitude had cast For ages on it,âhad, a silvery band Of moving sounds of gladness, hand in hand Arisen,âeach a visible delight,â Came three fair damsels, sunny in snowy white, From the red woodland gliding. They the knight,â For so they deemed the King, who came alone,â Graced with obeisance. And, âOur lord,â said one, âTenders you courtesy until the dawn, The Earl, Sir Damas. For the day is gone, And you are weary. Safe in his strong keep, Led thither with due worship, you shall sleep.â And so he came, o'erwearied, to a hall, An owlet-haunted pile, whose weedy wall Towered, rock on rock; its turrets, crowding high, Loomed, ancient as the crags, against a sky Wherein the moon hung, owl-eyed, round and full: An old, gaunt giant-castle, like a gull Hung on the weedy cliffs, where broke the dull Vast monotone of ocean, that uprolled Its windy waters; and where all was old, And sad, and swept of winds, and slain of salt, And haunted grim of ruin: where the vault Of heav'n bent ever, clamorous as the rout Of the defiant headlands, stretching out Into the night, with their voluminous shout Of wreck and wrath forever. Arthur then, Among the gaunt Earl's followers, swarthy men, Ate in the wild hall. Then a damsel led, With flaring torch, the tired King to bed, Down lonely labyrinths of that corridored keep. And soon he rested, sunk in heavy sleep. Then suddenly he woke; it seemed, 'mid groans And dolorous sighs: and round him lay the bones Of many men, and bodies mouldering. And he could hear the wind-swept ocean swing Its sighing surge above. And so he thought, âIt is some nightmare weighing me, distraught By that long hunt.â And then he sought to shake The horror off and to himself awake. But still he heard sad groans and whispering sighs: And gaunt, from iron-ribbÃ©d cells, the eyes Of pale, cadaverous knights regarded him, Unhappy: and he felt his senses swim With foulness of that dungeon.ââWhat are ye? Ghosts? or chained champions? or a company Of fiends?â he cried. Then, âSpeak! if speak ye can! Speak, in God's name! for I am hereâa man!â Then groaned the shaggy throat of one who lay, A wasted nightmare, dying day by day, Yet once a knight of comeliness, and strong And great and young, but now, through hunger long, A skeleton with hollow hands and cheeks:â âSir knight,â said he, âknow that the wretch who speaks Is only one of twenty knights entombed By Damas here; the Earl who so hath doomed Us in this dungeon, where starvation lairs; Around you lie the bones, whence famine stares, Of many knights. And would to God that soon My liberated ghost might see the moon Freed from the horror of this prisonment!â With that he sighed, and round the dungeon went A rustling sigh, as of the damned; and so Another dim, thin voice complained their woe: âKnow, he doth starve us to obtain this end: Because not one of us his strength will lend To battle for what still he calls his rights, This castle and its lands. For, of all knights, He is most base; lacks most in hardihood. A younger brother, Ontzlake, hath he; good And courteous; withal most noble; whom This Damas hatesâyea, even seeks his doom; Denying him to his estate all right Save that he holds by main of arms and might. Through puissance hath Ontzlake some few fields And one right sumptuous manor, where he deals With knights as knights should, with an open hand, Though ill he can afford it. Through the land He is far-famed for hospitality. Ontzlake is brave, but Damas cowardly. For Ontzlake would decide with sword and lance, Body to body, this inheritance: But Damas, vile as he is courageless, Doth on all knights, his guests, lay this duress, To fight for him or starve. For you must know That in this country he is hated so There is no champion who will take the fight. Thus fortunes it our plight is such a plight.â Quoth he and ceased. And, wondering at the tale, The King lay silent, while each wasted, pale, Poor countenance perused him; then he spake: âAnd what reward if one this cause should take?ââ âDeliverance for all if of us one Consent to be his party's champion. But treachery and he are so close kin We loathe the part as some misshapen sin; And here would rather with the rats find death Than, serving him, serve wrong, and save our breath, And on our heads, perhaps, bring down God's curse.â âMay God deliver you in mercy, sirs, And help us all!â said Arthur. At which word Straightway a groaning sound of iron was heard, Of chains rushed loose and bolts jarred rusty back, And hoarse the gate croaked open; and the black Of that rank cell astonished was with light, That danced fantastic with the frantic night. One high torch, sidewise worried by the gust, Sunned that dark den of hunger, death and dust; And one tall damsel, vaguely vestured, fair, With shadowy hair, poised on the rocky stair: And laughing on the King, âWhat cheer?â said she. âGod's life! the keep stinks vilely! And to see Such noble knights endungeoned, starving here, Doth pain me sore with pity. But, what cheer?â âThou mockest us. For me, the sorriest Since I was suckled; and of any quest This is the most imperiling and strange.â But what wouldst thou?â said Arthur. She, âA change I offer thee; through thee to these with thee, If thou wilt promise, in love's courtesy, To fight for Damas and his brotherhood. And if thou wilt notâlook! behold this brood Of lean and dwindled bellies, spectre-eyed,â Keen knights once,âwho refused me. So decide.â Then thought the King of the sweet sky, the breeze That blew delirious over waves and trees; Thick fields of grasses and the sunny Earth, Whose beating heat filled the high heart with mirth, And made the world one sovereign pleasure-house Where king and serf might revel and carouse: Then of the hunt on autumn-plaintive hills; Lone forest lodges by their radiant rills; His palace at Caerleon upon Usk, And Camelot's loud halls that through the dusk Blazed far and bloomed, a rose of revelry; Or, in the misty morning, shadowy Loomed, grave with audience. And then he thought Of his Round Table, and the Grael wide sought In haunted holds by many a haunted shore. Then marveled of what wars would rise and roar With dragon heads unconquered and devour This realm of Britain and crush out that flower Of chivalry whence ripened his renown: And then the reign of some besotted crown, Some bandit king of lust, idolatryâ And with that thought for tears he could not see.â Then of his best-loved champions, King Ban's son, And Galahad and Tristram, Accolon: And then, ah God! of his loved Guenevere: And with that thoughtâto starve 'mid horrors here!â For, being unfriend to Arthur and his Court, Well knew he this grim Earl would bless that sport Of fortune which had fortuned him so well As t' have his King to starve within a cell, In the entombing rock beside the deep.â And all the life, large in his limbs, did leap Through eager veins and sinews, fierce and red, Stung on to action; and he rose and said: âThat which thou askest is right hard, but, lo! To rot here, harder. I will fight his foe. But, mark, I have no weapons and no mail; No steed against that other to avail.â She laughed again; âIf we must beg or hire, Fear not for that: these thou shalt lack not, sire.â And so she led the way; her torch's fire Sprawling with spidery shadows at each stride The cob-webbed coignes of scowling arches wide. At length they reached an iron-studded door, Which she unlocked with one harsh key she bore 'Mid many keys bunched at her girdle; thence They issued on a terraced eminence. Below, the sea broke sounding; and the King Breathed open air again that had the sting And scent of brine, the far, blue-billowed foam: And in the east the second dawning's gloam, Since that unlucky chase, was freaked with streaks Red as the ripe stripes of an apple's cheeks. And so, within that larger light of dawn It seemed to Arthur now that he had known This maiden at his Court, and so he asked. But she, well tutored, her real person masked, And answered falsely, âNay, deceive thee not. Thou saw'st me ne'er at Arthur's Court, I wot. For here it likes me best to sing and spin, And needle hangings, listening to the din Of ocean, sitting some high tower within. No courts or tournaments or hunts I crave, No knights to flatter me! For meâthe wave, The cliffs, the sea and sky, in calm or storm; My garth, wherein I walk at morn; the charm Of ocean, redolent at bounteous noon, And sprayed with sunlight; night's free stars and moon: White ships that pass, some several every year; These ancient towers; and those wild mews to hear.â âAn owlet maid,â the King laughed.âBut untrue Was she, and of false Morgane's treasonous crew, Deep in intrigues, even for the slaying of The King, her brother, whom she did not love.â And presently she brought him where, in state, This swarthy Damas, 'mid his wildmen sate. And Accolon, at Castle Chariot still, Had lost long weeks in love. Her husband ill, Morgane, perforce, must leave her lover here Among the hills of Gore. A lodge stood near A cascade in the forest, where their wont Was to sit listening the falling fount, That, through sweet talks of many idle hours On moss-banks, varied with the violet flowers, Had learned the lovers' language,âsighed above,â And seemed, in every fall, to whisper, âloveâ; That echoed through the lodge, her hands had draped With curious hangings; where were worked and shaped Remembered hours of pleasure, body and soul; Imperishable passions, which made whole The past again in pictures; and could mate The heart with loves long dead; and re-create The very kisses of those perished knights With woven records of long-dead delights. Below the lodge within an urnÃ©d shell The water pooled, and made a tinkling well, Then, slipping thence, through dripping shadows fell From rippling rock to rock. Here Accolon, With Morgane's hollow lute, as eve drew on Came all alone: not ev'n her brindled hound To bound before him o'er the gleaming ground; No handmaid lovely of his loveliest fair, Or paging dwarf in purple with him there; Only her lute, about which her perfume Clung, odorous of memories, that made bloom Her absent features, making them arise, Like some rich flower, before his memory's eyes, That seemed to see her lips and to surmise The words they fashioned; then the smile that drank Her soul's deep fire from eyes wherein it sank And slowly waned away to deeper dreams, Fathomless with thought, down in their dove-gray streams. And so for her imagined eyes and lips, Heart-fashioned features, all the music slips Of all his soul, himseems, into his voice, To sing her praises. And, with nervous poise, His fleet, trained fingers waken in her lute Such mellow riot as must make envy-mute The nightingale that listens quivering. And well he hopes that, winging thence, 'twill sing A similar song;âwhose passions burn and pain Its anguished soul, now silent,ânot in vain Beneath her casement, in that garden old Dingled with heavy roses; in the gold Of Camelot's stars and pearl-encrusted moon: And still he hopes the heartache of the tune Will clamor secret memories in her ear, Of life, less dear than death with her not near; Of love, who longs for her, to have her here: Till melt her eyes with tears; and sighs and sobs O'erwhelm her soul, and separation throbs Hard at her heart, that, longing, lifts to death A prayerful pleading, crying, âBut a breath, One moment of real heaven, there! in his arms! Close, close! And, for that moment, then these charms, This body, hell, canst have forevermore!â And sweet to know, perhaps its song will pour Into the dull ear of her drowsy lord A vague suspicion of some secret word, Borne by the bird,âlove's wingÃ©d messenger,â To her who lies beside him; even her, His wife, whom still he loves; whom Accolon Thus sings of where the woods of Gore grow wan:â âThe thought of thy white coming, like a song Breathed soft of lovely lips and lute-like tongue, Sways all my bosom with a sweet unrest; Makes wild my heart that oft thy heart hath pressed.â Come! press it once again, for it is strong To bear that weight which never yet distressed. âO come! and straight the woodland is stormed through With wilder wings, and brighter with bright dew: And every flow'r, where thy fair feet have passed, Puts forth a fairer blossom than the last, Thrilled of thine eyes, those arsenals of blue, Wherein the arrows of all love are cast. âO Love, she comes! O Love, I feel her breath, Like the soft South, that idly wandereth Through musical leaves of laughing laziness, Page on before her, how sweet,ânone can guess: Sighing, âShe comes! thy heart's dear life and death; In whom is all thy bliss and thy distress.â âShe comes! she comes! and all my mind doth rave For words to tell her how she doth enslave My soul with beauty: then o'erwhelm with love That loveliness, no words can tell whereof; Words, words, like roses, every path to pave, Each path to strew, and no word sweet enough! âShe comes!âThro' me a passionâas the moon Works wonder in the seaâthrough me doth swoon Ungovernable glory; and her soul Seems blent with mine; and now, to some bright goal, Compels me, throbbing like a tender tune, Exhausting all my efforts of control. âShe comes! ah, God! ye little stars that grace The fragmentary skies, and scatter space, Brighter her steps that golden all my gloom! Ah, wood-indulging, violet-vague perfume, Sweeter the presence of her wild-flower face, That fragrance-fills my life, and stars with bloom! âOh, boundless exultation of the blood! That now compels me to some higher mood, Diviner sense of something that outsoars The Earthâher kiss! that all love's splendor pours Into me; all delicious womanhood, So all the heart that hesitatesâadores. âSweet, my soul's victor! heart's triumphant Sweet! Within thy bosom Love hath raised his seat; There he sits crowned; and, from thy eyes and hair, Shoots his soft arrows,âas the moonbeams fair,â That long have laid me supine at thy feet, And changed my clay to ardent fire and air. âMy love! my witch! whose kiss, like some wild wine, Has subtly filled me with a flame divine, An aspiration, whose fierce pulses urge In all my veins, with rosy surge on surge, To hurl me in that heaven, all which is mine, Thine arms! from which I never would emerge.â His ecstasy the very foliage shook; The wood seemed hushed to hear, and hushed the brook; And even the heavens, wherein one star shone clear, Seemed leaning nearer, his glad song to hear, To which its wild star throbbed, all golden-pale: And after which, deep in the purple vale, Awoke the passion of the nightingale. III As one hath seen a green-gowned huntress fair, Morn in her cheeks and midnight in her hair; Keen eyes as gray as rain, young limbs as lithe As the wild fawn's; and silvery voice as blithe As is the wind that breathes of flowers and dews, Breast through the bramble-tangled avenues; Through brier and thorn, that pluck her gown of green, And snag it here and there,âthrough which the sheen Of her white skin gleams rosy;âeyes and face, Ardent and flushed, fixed on the lordly chase: So came the Evening to that shadowy wood, Or so it seemed to Accolon, who stood Watching the sunset through the solitude. So Evening came; and shadows cowled the way Like ghostly pilgrims who kneel down to pray Before a wayside shrine: and, radiant-rolled, Along the west, the battlemented gold Of sunset walled the opal-tinted skies, That seemed to open gates of Paradise On soundless hinges of the winds, and blaze A glory, far within, of chrysoprase, Towering in topaz through the purple haze. And from the sunset, down the roseate ways, To Accolon, who, with his idle lute, Reclined in revery against the root Of a great oak, a fragment of the west, A dwarf, in crimson satin tightly dressed, Skipped like a leaf the early frosts have burned, A red oak-leaf; and like a leaf he turned, And danced and rustled. And it seemed he came From Camelot; from his belovÃ©d dame, Morgane le Fay. He on his shoulder bore A mighty blade, wrought strangely o'er and o'er With mystic runes, drawn from a scabbard which Glared venomous, with angry jewels rich. He, louting to the knight, âSir knight,â said he, âYour Lady, with all tenderest courtesy, Assures youâah, unworthy bearer I Of her good message!âof her constancy.â Then, doffing the great baldric, with the sword, To him he gave them, saying, âFrom my lord, King Arthur: even his Excalibur, The magic blade which Merlin gat of her, The Ladye of the Lake, who, as you wot, Fostered in infanthood Sir Launcelot, Upon some isle in Briogne's tangled lands Of meres and mists; where filmy fairy bands, By lazy moons of summer, dancing, fill With rings of morrice every grassy hill. Through her fair favor is this weapon sent, Who begged it of the King with this intent: That, for her honor, soon would be begun A desperate battle with a champion, Of wondrous prowess, by Sir Accolon: And with the sword, Excalibur, more sure Were she that he against him would endure. Magic the blade, and magic, too, the sheath, Which, while 'tis worn, wards from the wearer death.â He ceased: and Accolon held up the sword Excalibur and said, âIt shall go hard With him through thee, unconquerable blade, Whoe'er he be, who on my Queen hath laid Insult or injury! And hours as slow As palsied hours in Purgatory go For those unmassed, till I have slain this foe!â Here, page, my purse.âAnd now, to her who gave, Despatch! and say: To all commands, her slave, To death obedient, I!âIn love or war Her love to make me all the warrior.â Bid her have mercy, nor too long delay From him, who dies an hourly death each day Till, her white hands kissed, he shall kiss her face, Through which his life lives on, and still finds grace.â Thus he commanded. And, incontinent, The dwarf departed, like a red shaft sent Into the sunset's sea of scarlet light Burning through wildwood glooms. And as the night With votaress cypress veiled the dying strife Sadly of day, and closed his book of life And clasped with golden stars, in dreamy thought Of what this fight was that must soon be fought, Belting the blade about him, Accolon, Through the dark woods tow'rds Chariot passed on. And it befell him thus, the following dawn, As he was wandering on a dew-drenched lawn, Glad with the freshness and elastic health Of sky and earth, that lavished all their wealth Of heady winds and racy scents,âa knight And gentle lady met him, gay bedight, With following of six esquires; and they Held on gloved wrists the hooded falcon gray, And rode a-hawking o'er the leas of Gore From Ontzlake's manor, where he languished; sore Hurt in the lists, a spear wound in his thigh: Who had besoughtâfor much he feared to dieâ This knight and his fair lady, as they rode To hawk near Chariot, Morgane's abode, That they would beg her in all charity To come to him (for in chirurgery Of all that land she was the greatest leach), And her for his recovery beseech. So, Accolon saluted, they drew rein, And spake their message, for, right over fain Were they toward their sport,âthat he would bear Petition to that lady. But, not there Was Arthur's sister, as they well must wot; But now a sennight lay at Camelot, The guest of Guenevere; and with her there Four other queens of Farther Britain were: Isoud of Ireland, she of Cornwall Queen, King Mark's wife,âwho right rarely then was seen At Court for jealousy of Mark, who knew Her to that lance of Lyonesse how true Since mutual quaffing of a philter; while How guilty Guenevere on such could smile:â She of Northgales and she of Eastland; and She of the Out Isles Queen. A fairer band, For sovereignty and love and loveliness, Was not in any realm to grace and bless. So Accolon informed them. In distress Then quoth that knight: âAy? see how fortune turns And varies like an April day, that burns Now welkins blue with calm; now scowls them down, Revengeful, with a black storm's wrinkled frown. For, look! this Damas, who so long hath lain A hiding vermin, fearful of all pain, Dark in his bandit towers by the deep, Wakes from a five years' torpor and a sleep, And sends despatch a courier to my lord, Sir Ontzlake, with, âTo-morrow, with the sword, Earl Damas and his knight, at point of lance, Decides the issue of inheritance, Body to body, or by champion.ââ Right hard to find such ere to-morrow dawn. Though sore bestead lies Ontzlake, if he could, He would arise and save his livelihood.â Then thought Sir Accolon: âOne might suppose, So soon this follows on her message, those Same things befall through Morgane's artsâwho knows?â Howe'er it be, as 'twere for her own sake, This battle I myself will undertake.â Then said to those, âI know the good Ontzlake. If he be so conditioned, harried of Estate and life,âin knighthood and for love Of justice I his quarrel will assume. My limbs are keen for armor. Let the groom Prepare my steed. Right good 'twill be again To feel him under me.ââThen, of that train, Asked that one gentleman with him remain, And men to squire his horse and arms. And then, When this was granted, mounted with his men And thence departed. And, ere noontide, they Came to a lone, dismantled priory Hard by a castle 'gainst whose square, grey towers, Machicolated, mossed, in forest bowers, Full many a siege had beat and onset rushed: A forest fortress, old and deep-imbushed In wild and woody hills. And then one wound A hoarse slug-horn, and at the savage sound The drawbridge rumbled moatward, clanking, and Into a paved court rode that little band. When all the world was morning, gleam and glare Of autumn glory; and the frost-touched air Rang with the rooks as rings a silver lyre Swept swift of minstrel fingers, wire on wire; Ere that fixed hour of prime, came Arthur, armed For battle royally. A black steed warmed A keen impatience 'neath him, cased in mail Of foreign make; accoutered head and tail In costly sendal; rearward, wine-dark red, Amber as sunlight to his fretful head. Blue armor of linked steel had Arthur on, Beneath a robe of honor made of drawn, Ribbed satin, diapered and purfled deep With lordly gold and purple; whence did sweep Two acorn-tufted bangles of fine gold: And at his thigh a falchion, battle-old And triple-edged; its rune-stamped scabbard, of Cordovan leather, baldric'd rich above With new-cut deer-skin, that, laborious wrought, And curiously, with slides of gold was fraught, And buckled with a buckle white, that shone, Tongued red with gold, and carved of walrus' bone. And, sapphire-set, a burgonet of gold,â Whereon a wyvern sprawled, whose jaws unrolled A tongue of garnet agate, of great prize; Its orbs of glaring ruby, great in size,â Incased his head and visor-barred his eyes. And in his hand a wiry lance of ash, Lattened with sapphire silver, like a flash, A splinter of sunlight, in the morning's zeal Glittered, its point, as 'twere, a star of steel.â A squire attended him; a youth, whose head Waved many a jaunty curl; whereon a red Cock-feathered cap shone brave: 'neath which, as keen As some wild hawk's, his green-gray eyes were seen: And parti-colored leather shoes he had Upon his feet; his legs were silken clad In hose of rarest Totness: and a spear, Bannered and bronzen, dappled as a deer, One hand upheld, like some bright beam of morn; And round his neck was hung a bugle-horn. So with his following, while, bar on bar, The blue mist lay on woodside and on scar, Through mist and dew, through shadow and through ray, Joustward Earl Damas led the forest way. Then to King Arthur, when arrived were these Where bright the lists shone, bannered, through the trees, A wimpled damsel with a falchion came, Mounted upon a palfrey, all aflame With sweat and heat of hurry; and, âFrom her, Your sister, Morgane, your Excalibur! With tender greeting. For you well may need Its aid in this adventure. So, God speed!â Said and departed suddenly: nor knew The King that this was not his weapon true: A brittle forgery, in likeness of That blade, of baser metal;âin unlove And treason made by her, of all his kin The nearest, Morgane; who, her end to win, Stopped at no thing; thinking, with Arthur dead, The crown would grace her own and Accolon's head. Then, heralded, into the lists he rode. Opposed flashed Accolon, whose strength bestrode, Exultant, strong in talisman of that sword, A dun horse lofty as a haughty lord, White-pasterned, and of small, impatient hoof: Both knight and steed shone armed in mail of proof, Of yellow-dappled, variegated plate Of Spanish laton. And of sovereign state His surcoat robe of honor,âwhite and black, Of satin, crimson-orphreyed,âat his back The wind made billow: and, from forth this robe, Excalibur,âa throbbing golden globe Of vicious jewels,âthrust its splendid hilt; Its broad belt, tawny and with goldwork gilt, An eyelid clasped, black, of the black seahorse, Tongued red with rosy gold. And pride and force Sat on his wingÃ©d helmet, plumed, of rich Bronze-hammered laton; blazing upon which A hundred brilliants glittered, thick as on A silver web bright-studding dews of dawn: Its crest, a taloned griffin, high that ramped; In whose horned brow one blood-red gem was stamped. A spear of ash, long-shafted, overlaid With azure silver, whereon colors played, Firm in his iron gauntlet lithely swayed. Intense on either side the champions stood, Shining as serpents that, with spring renewed, In gleaming scales, meet on a wild-wood way, Their angry tongues flickering at poisonous play. Then clanged a herald's trumpet: and harsh heels, Sharp-thrust, each courser felt; the roweled steels Spurred forward; and the couched and fiery spears, Flashed, as two bolts of storm the tempest steers With adverse thunder; and, in middle course, Crashed full the unpierced shields, and horse from horse Lashed, madly pawing.âAnd a hoarse roar rang From the loud lists, till far the echoes sang Of hill and rock-hung forest and wild cliff. Rigid the champions rode where, standing stiff, Their esquires tendered them the spears they held. Again the trumpet blew, and, firmly selled, Forward they galloped, shield to savage shield, And crest to angry crest: the wyvern reeled, Towering, against the griffin: scorn and scath Upon their fiery fronts and in the wrath Of their gem-blazing eyes: each figure stood A symbol of the heart beneath the hood.â The lance of Accolon, as on a rock The storm-launched foam breaks baffled, with the shock, On Arthur's sounding shield burst splintered force; But him resistless Arthur's,âhigh from horse Uplifted,âheadlong bore, and crashed him down; A long sword's length unsaddled. Accolon For one stunned moment lay. Then, rising, drew The great sword at his hip that shone like dew Smitten with morn. âDescend!â he grimly said, âTo proof of better weapons, head to head! Enough of spears! to swords!ââAnd from his height The King clanged down. And quick, like some swift light, His moon-bright brand unsheathed. And, hollowed high, Each covering shield gleamed, slantwise, to'ards the sky, A blazoned eye of bronze: and underneath, As 'neath two clouds, the lightning and the death Of the fierce swords played. Now a shield descendsâ A long blade leaps;âand now, a fang that rends, Another blade, loud as a battle word, Beats downward, trenchant; and, resounding heard, A shield's fierce face replies: again a sword Swings for a giant blow, and, balked again, Burns crashing from a sword. Thus, o'er the plain, Over and over, blade on baleful blade; Teeth clenched; and eyes, behind their visors' shade, Like wild beasts' eyes in caverns; shield to shield, The champions strove, each scorning still to yield. Then Arthur drew aside to rest upon His falchion for a space. But Accolon, As yet,âthrough virtue of that magic sheath,â Fresh and almighty, and no nearer death Now than when first the fight to death begun, Chafed at delay. But Arthur, with the sun, His heavy mail, his wounds, and loss of blood, Made weary, ceased and for a moment stood Leaning upon his sword. Then, âDost thou tire?â Sneered Accolon. And then, with fiercer fire, âDefend thee! yield thee! or die recreant!â And at the King aimed a wild blow, aslant, That beat a flying fire from the steel. Stunned by that blow, the King, with brain a-reel, Sank on one knee; then rose, infuriate, Nerved with new vigor; and with heat and hate Gnarled all his strength into one blow of might, And in both fists his huge blade knotted tight, And swung, terrific, for a final stroke,â And,âas the lightning flames upon an oak,â Boomed on the burgonet his foeman wore; Hacked through and through its crest, and cleanly shore, With hollow clamor, from his head and ears, The brag and boasting of that griffin fierce: Then, in an instant, as if made of glass, That brittle blade burst, shattered; and the grass Shone, strewn with shards; as 'twere a broken ray, It fell and bright in feverish fragments lay. Then groaned the King, disarmed. And straight he knew This sword was not Excalibur: too true And perfect tempered, runed and mystical, That weapon of old wars! and then withal, Looking upon his foe, who still with stress Fought on, untiring, and with no distress Of wounds or heat, he thought, âI am betrayed!â Then as the sunlight struck along that blade, He knew it, by the hilt, for his own brand, The true Excalibur, that high in hand Now rose avenging. For Sir Accolon In madness urged th' unequal battle on His King defenseless; who, the hilted cross Of that false weapon grasped, beneath the boss Of his deep-dented shield crouched; and around, Like some great beetle, labored o'er the ground, Whereon the shards of shattered spears and bits Of shivered steel and gold made sombre fits Of flame, 'mid which, hard-pressed and cowering Beneath his shield's defense, the dauntless King Crawled still defiant. And, devising still How to secure his sword and by what skill, Him thus it fortuned when most desperate: In that close chase they came where, shattered late, Lay, tossed, the truncheon of a bursten lance, Which, deftly seized, to Accolon's advance He wielded with effect. Against the fist Smote, where the gauntlet clasped the nervous wrist, That heaved Excalibur for one last blow; Sudden the palsied sinews of his foe Relaxed in effort, and, the great sword seized, Was wrenched away: and straight the wroth King eased Himself of his huge shield, and hurled it far; And clasping in both arms of wiry war His foe, Sir Accolon,âas one hath seen A strong wind take an ash tree, rocking green, And swing its sappy bulk, then, trunk and boughs, Crash down its thundering height in wild carouse And wrath of tempest,âso King Arthur shook And headlong flung Sir Accolon. Then took, Tearing away, that scabbard from his side And hurled it through the lists, that far and wide Gulped in the battle breathless. Then, still wroth, He seized Excalibur; and grasped of both Wild hands, swung trenchant, and brought glittering down On rising Accolon. Steel, bone and brawn That blow hewed through. Unsettled every sense. Bathed in a world of blood, his limbs lay tense A moment, then grew limp, relaxed in death. And bending o'er him, from the brow beneath, The King unlaced the helm. When dark, uncasqued, The knight's slow eyelids opened, Arthur asked: âSay, ere thou diest, whence and who thou art! What king, what court is thine? And from what part Of Britain dost thou come? Speak!âfor, methinks, I have beheld theeâwhere? Some memory links Me strangely with thy face, thy eyes . . . thou artâ Who art thou?âspeak!ââ He answered, slow, then short, With labored breathing: âI?âone, Accolon,â Of Gaulâa knight of Arthur's courtâanonâ But to what endâyea, tell meâam I slain?ââ Then bent King Arthur nearer and again Drew back: then, anguish in his utterance, sighed: âOne of my Table!ââThen asked softly, âSay, Whence hadst thou this, my sword? say, in what way Thou cam'st by it?ââBut, wandering, that knight Heard with dull ears, divining but by sight The question asked; and answered, âWoe!âthe sword!â Woe worth the sword!âLean down!âCanst hear my word?â From Morgane! Arthur's sister, who had made Me king of all this kingdom, so she saidâ Hadst thou not 'risen, accursÃ©d, like a fate, To make our schemes miscarry!âWait! nay, wait!â A king! dost hear?âa gold and blood-crowned king, I!âArthur's sister, queen!âNo bird can wing Higher than her ambition! that resolved Her brother's death was needed, and evolved Plots that should ripen with the ripening year, And here be reaped, perhapsânay, nay! not here!â Farewell, my Morgane!âYea, 'twas she who schemed While there at Chariot we loved and dreamed Gone some six months.âThere nothing gave us care. Each morning was a liberal almoner Prodigal of silver to the earth and air: Each eve, a fiery dragon, cloud-enrolled, Convulsive, dying overwhelmed with gold; On such an eve it was, that, redolent, She sat by me and said,ââMy message sent, Some nightâwithin the forestâthou, my knight! Thou and the king!âmy menâthe forest fight!â Murder perhaps.âBut, well?âwho is to blame?â . . . So with her blood-red thoughts to me she came. To me! that woman, brighter than a flame, And wooed my soul to hell, with love accurs'd; With harlot lips, from which my being first Drank hell and heaven. She, who was in sooth My heaven and hell.âBut now, behind her youth She shrivels to a hag!âI see the truth!â Harlot!ânay, spouse of Urience, King of Gore!â Wanton!ânay, witch! sweet witch!âwhat wouldst thou more?â Hast thou not had thy dream? and wilt thou grieve That death so ruins it?âThou dost perceive How I still love thee! witness bear this field, This field and he to whom I would not yield!â Would thou wert here to kiss me ere I die!ââ Then anger in the good King's gloomy eye Glowed, instant-embered, as one oft may see A star blaze up in heaven, then cease to be. Slow from his visage he his visor raised, And on the dying knight a moment gazed; Then grimly said, âLook on me, Accolon! I am thy King!â He, with an awful groan, Blade-battered as he was, beheld and knew; Strained to his tottering knees; and, gasping, drew Up full his armored height and hoarsely cried, âThe King!â and at his mailed feet crashed and died. Then came a world of anxious faces, pressed About King Arthur; who, though sore distressed, Bespake that multitude: âWhile breath and power Remain, judge we these brothers: This hard hour Hath given to Damas all this rich estate: So it is his; allotted his by fate And force of arms. So let it be to him. For, stood our oath on knighthood not so slim But that it hath this strong conclusiÃ¶n. This much by us as errant knight is done.â Now our decree, as King of Britain, hear: We do command Earl Damas to appear No more upon our shores, or any isles Of farthest Britain in its many miles. One week be his, no more! then will we come, Even with an iron host, to seal his doom: If he be not departed overseas, With all his men and all his outlawries, From his own towers, around which sea-birds clang, Alive and naked shall he starve and hang And rot! vile food for kites and carrion crows. Thus much for him! . . . But all our favor goes Toward Sir Ontzlake, whom it likes the King To take into his knightly following Of the Round Table. Bear to him our word. But I am over weary. Take my sword.â Unharness me, for more and more I tire; And all my wounds are so much aching fire. Yea; help me hence. To-morrow I would fain To Glastonbury and with me the slain.â So bore they then the wounded King away, The dead behind, as closed the autumn day. But when, within that abbey, he waxed strong, The King, remembering the marauder wrong Which Damas had inflicted on that land, Commanded Lionell, with a stanch band, To stamp this weed out if still rooted there. He, riding thither to that robber lair, Led Arthur's hopefulest helms, when, thorn on thorn, Reddened an hundred spears one winter morn: And foundâa ruin of fire-blackened rock, Of tottering towers, that shook to every shock Of the wild waves; and loomed above the bents Turrets and cloudy-clustered battlements, Wailing with wind that swept those clamorous lands: Above the foam, that climbed with haling hands, Desolate and gaunt; reflected in the flats; Hollow and huge, the haunt of owls and bats. IV Hate, born of Wrath and mother red of Crime, In Hell was whelped ere the hot hands of Time, Artificer of God, had coined our world Within the formless void, and round it furled Its lordly raiment of the day and night, And germed its womb with beauty and delight: And Hell sent Hate to Earth, that it might use And serve Hell's ends, filling with flame its cruse. . . . For her half-brother Morgane had conceived Unnatural hatred; so much so, she grieved, Envious and jealous, for the high renown And might the King had gathered round his crown Through truth and honor. And who was it said, âThose nearest to the crown are those to dreadâ?â Warm in your breast a serpent, it will sting The breast that warms it: and albeit the King Knew of his sister's hate, he passed it by, Thinking that love and kindness gradually Would win her heart to him. He little knew The witch he dealt with, beautiful to view, And all the poison she could stoop to brew. She, who, well knowing how much mightier The King than Accolon, rejoiced that her Wits had secured from him Excalibur, Without which, she was certain, in the joust The King were as a foe unarmed. Her trust Smiled, confident of conclusion: eloquent, Within her, whispered of success, that lent Her heart a lofty hope; and at large eyes Piled up imperial dreams of power and prize. And in her carven chamber, oaken-dark, Traceried and arrased,âwhen the barren park Dripped, drenched with autumn,âfor November lay Swathed frostily in fog on every spray,â She at her tri-arched casement sate one night, Ere yet came courier from that test of might. Her lord in slumber and the castle full Of drowsy silence and the rain's dull lull: âThe King removed?âmy soul!âhe is removed! Ere now dog-dead he lies. His sword hath proved Too much for him. Yet! let him lie in state, The great king, Arthur!âBut, regenerate, Now crown our other monarch, Accolon! And, with him, Love, the ermined! balmy son Of gods, not men; and nobler hence to rule. Love, Love almighty; beautiful to school The hearts and souls of mortals!âThen this realm's Iron-huskÃ©d flower of war,âthat overwhelms The world with havoc,âwill explode and bloom The amaranth, peace, with love for its perfume. And then, O Launcelots and Tristrams, vowed To Gueneveres and Isouds,ânow allowed No pleasure but what hour by stolen hour, In secret places, brings to flaming flower,â You shall have feasts of passion evermore! And out-thrust Love, now shivering at the door, No more shalt stand neglected and cast off, Insulted and derided; and the scoff Of War, the bully, whose hands of insult fling Off, for the iron of arms, thy hands that cling About his brutal feet, that crush thy face, Bleeding, into the dust.âHere, in War's place, We will erect a shrine of sacrifice; Love's sacrifice; a shrine of purest price; Where each shall lay his heart and each his soul For Love, for earthly Love! who shall control The world, and make it as the Heaven whole; Being to it its stars and moon and sun, Its firmament and all its lights in one. And if by such Love Heaven should be debarred, Its God, its spheres, with spiritual love instarred, Hell will be Heaven, our Heaven, while Love shall thus Remain earth Love, that God encouraged in us. âAnd now for Urience, my gaunt old lord!â There lies my worry.âYet, hath he no sword No dangerous dagger I, hid softly here, Sharp as an adder's fang? or for his ear No instant poison to insinuate Ice in his pulses, and with death abate?â So did she then determine; on that night Of lonely autumn, when no haggard, white, Wan, watery moon dreamed on the streaming pane; But, on the leads, beat the incessant rain, And the lamenting wind wailed wild among The trees and turrets, like a phantom throng. So grew her face severe as skies that take Suggestions of far storm whose thunders shake The distant hills with wrath, and cleave with fire A pine the moaning forest mourns as sireâ So touched her countenance that dark intent: And in still eyes her thoughts were evident, As in dark waters, luminous and deep, The heavens glass themselves when o'er them sweep The clouds of storm and austere stars they keep,â Ghostly and gray,âlocked in their steadfast gloom. Then, as if some great wind had swept the room, Silent, intense, she rose up from her seat. As if dim arms had made her a retreat, Secret as thought to move in, like a ghost, Noiseless as sleep and subtle as the frost, Poised like a light and borne as carefully, She trod the gusty hall where shadowy The hangings rolled a dim Pendragon war. And there the mail of Urience shone. A star, Glimmering above, a dying cresset dropped From the stone vault and flared. And here she stopped, And took the sword, fresh-burnished by his page, Long as a flame of pale, arrested rage.â For she had thought that, when they found him dead, His sword laid by him on the bloody bed Would be convictive that his own hand had Done him this violence when fever-mad. The sword she took; and to the chamber, where King Urience slept, she glided; like an air, Smooth in seductive sendal; or a fit Of faery song, a wicked charm in it, That slays; an incantation full of guile. She paused upon his threshold; for a while Listened; and, sure he slept, stole in and stood Crouched o'er his couch. About her heart the blood Caught, strangling; then rose throbbing, thud on thud, Up to her wide-stretched eyes, and up and up, As wine might, whirling wildly in a cup. Then came rare Recollection, with a mouth. Sweet as the honeyed sunbeams of the South Trickling through perplexed ripples of the leaves; To whose faint form a veil of starshine cleaves Intricate gauze from memoried eyes to feetâ Feet softer than the sifted snows and fleet To come and go and airy anxiously. She, trembling to her, like a flower a bee Nests in and makes an audible mouth of musk, Lisping a downy message to the dusk, Laid lips to ears and languaged memories of Now hateful Urience:âHow her maiden love Had left Caerleon secretly for Gore, With him, one day of autumn. How a boar, Wild as the wildness of the solitude, Raged at her from a cavern of the wood, That, crimson-creepered, yawned the bristling curse Murderous upon her. As her steed grew worse And, terrified, fled snorting down the dell, How she had flung herself from out the selle, In fear, upon a bank of springy moss, Where she lay swooning: in an utter loss Of mind and limbs; wherein she seemed to see, Or saw in horror, half unconsciously,â As one who pants beneath an incubus And strives to shriek or move, delirious,â The monster-thing thrust tow'rds her, tusked and fanged, And hideous snouted: how the whole wood clanged And buzzed and boomed a hundred sounds and lights Lawless about her brain,âlike leaves wild nights Of hurricane harvest, shouting.âThen it seemed A fury thundered 'twixt themâand she screamed As round her flew th' uprooted loam that held Leaves, twigs and matted moss; and, clanging, swelled Continual echoes with the thud of strife, And groan of man and brute that warred for life: How all the air, gone mad with foam and forms, Spun froth and, 'twixt her, wrestled hair and arms, And hoofs and feet that crushed the leaves and shred, Whirling them wildly, brown, and yellow, and red. And how she rose and leaned her throbbing head, With all its uncoifed braids of raven hair Disheveled, on one arm,âas white and fair And smooth as milk,âand saw, as through a haze, The brute thing throttled and the frowning face Of Urience bent above it, browed with might; One red swol'n arm, that pinned the hairy fright, Strong as a god's, iron at the gullet's brawn: Dug in its midriff, the close knees, updrawn, Wedged, as with steel, the glutton sides that strove,â A shaggy bulk,âwith hoofs that drove and drove. And then she saw how Urience swiftly slipped One arm, the monster's tearing tusks had ripped And ribboned redly, to the dagger's hilt,â Which at his hip hung long, its haft gold-gilt;â Flame-like it flashed; and then, as bright as ice, Plunged, and replunged; again, now twice, now thrice; And the huge boar, stretched out in sullen death, Lay, bubbling blood, with harsh, laborious breath. Then how he brought her water from a well, That rustled freshly near them as it fell From its full-mantled urn, in his deep casque, And begged her drink; then bathed her brow, a task That had accompanying tears of joy and vows Of love, and intercourse of eyes and brows, And many kisses: then, beneath the boughs, His wound dressed, and her steed still violent From fear, she mounted and behind him bent And clasped him on the same steed; and they went On through the gold wood tow'rds the golden west, Till, on one low hill's forest-covered crest, Gray from the gold, his castle's battlements pressed. And then she felt she'd loved him till had come Fame of the love of Isoud, whom, from home, Tristram had brought across the Irish foam; And Guenevere's for Launcelot of the Lake: Then how her thought from these did seem to take Reflex of longing; and within her wake Desire for some great lover who should slake; And such found Accolon. And then she thought How far she'd fallen, and how darkly fraught With consequence was this. Then what distress Were hers and hisâher lover'sâand success How doubly difficult if, Arthur slain, King Urience lived to assert his right to reign. So she stood pondering with the sword; her lips Breathless, and tight as were her finger-tips About the weapon's hilt. And so she sighed, âNay, nay! too long hast lived who shouldst have died Even in the womb, my sorrow! who for years Hast leashed my life to thine, a bond of tears, A weight of care, a knot that thus I part! Thus harshly sever! Ugly that thou art Into the elements naked!â O'er his heart The long blade paused andâthen descended hard. Unfleshed, she flung it by her murdered lord, And watched the blood spread darkly through the sheet, And drip, a horror, at impassive feet Pooling the polished oak. Regretless she Stood, and relentless; in her ecstasy A lovely devil: demon crowned, that cried For Accolon, with passion that defied Control in all her senses; clamorous as A torrent in a cavernous mountain pass That sweeps to wreck and ruin; at that hour So swept her longing tow'rds her paramour. Him whom, King Arthur had commanded when Borne from the lists, she should receive again; Her lover, her dear Accolon, as was just, As was but due her for her loveâand lust. And while she stood revolving if her deed's Secret were safe, behold! a noise of steeds, Arms, jingling stirrups, voices loud that cursed Fierce in the northern court. To her, athirst For him her lover, war and power it spoke, Him victor and so king. And then awoke Desire to see and greet him: and she fled, Like some wild spectre, down the stairs; and, red, Burst on a glare of links and glittering mail, That shrunk her eyes and made her senses quail. To her a bulk of iron, bearded fierce, Down from a steaming steed into her ears, âThis from the King, O Queen!â laughed harsh and hoarse: Two henchmen beckoned, who pitched sheer, with force, Loud clanging at her feet, hacked, hewn, and red, Crusted with blood, a knight in armorâdead: Her Accolon, flung in his battered arms By what to her seemed fiends and demon forms, Wild-torched, who mocked; then, with the parting scoff, âThis from the King!â phantoms in fog, rode off. And what remains?âFrom Camelot to Gore That night she, wailing, fled; thence, to the shore,â As old romances tell,âof Avalon; Where she hath majesty gold-crowned and wan: Clothed dark in cypress, still her lovely face Is young and queenly; sweeter though in grace, And softer for the sorrow there; the trace Of immemorial tears as for some crime, Attempted or committed at some time, Some old, unhappy time of long ago, That haunts her eyes and fills them with its woe: Sad eyes, dark, future-fixed, expectant of That far-off hour awaited of her love, When the forgiving Arthur cometh and Shall rule, dim King, o'er all that golden land, That Isle of Avalon, where none grows old, Where spring is ever, and never a wind blows cold; That lifts its mountains from forgotten seas Of surgeless turquoise deep with mysteries.â And so was seen Morgana nevermore, Save once, when from the Cornwall coast she bore The wounded Arthur from that last fought fight Of Camlan in a black barge into night. But some may see her, with a palfried band Of serge-stoled maidens, through the drowsy land Of autumn glimmer,âwhen are sadly strewn The red leaves, and, broad in the east, the moon Hangs, full of frost, a lustrous globe of gleams,â Faint on the mooning hills as shapes in dreams. PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC Beyond the walls, past wood and twilight field, The Usk slipped onward under wharf and wall Of old Caerleon, rolling down, it seemed,â Incarnadined with splendor of the west,â The heathen blood of all of Arthur's wars. So she had left him; and he stood alone Within the carven casement, where a ray Of sunset laid a bleeding spear athwart The dark oak hall, and, on the arras gaunt A crimson blade of battle red that dripped.â And now life's bitterness took Peredur By all his heart's strings, smiting. He would go, Equipped for quest, through all the savagery Of mountain and of forest. And this girl?â Forget her! and her game of shuttlecock, Of battledore and shuttlecock with his heart, This Angharad! this child the Court had spoiled! Now he remembered how he once had ridd'n, Spurring his piebald stallion down the square, Upon the King's quest, and a girl had laughed From some be-dragoned balcony of walls That faced the gateway; and in passing he Had glimpsed her beauty. It was she. And then He thought how she had haunted him for days, For weeks; and how, returning to Caerleon, His long quest ended, how it thus befell: Deep snow had fallen and the winter wood Lay carpeted with silence. And he rode Into a vista where a raven lay Slain of a hawk; some blood-drops dyed the snow. He lost himself in quaint comparisons Of how the sifted drift was as her skin; The raven's feathers as her heavy hair; And in her cheeks the health of maidenhood Red as the blood-drops. So he sat and dreamed: When one rode up in angry steel and spoke Thrice to no answer, and in anger dashed A gauntlet in his face and made at him: And how he slew him and rode over him, Fiercer than fire; then how he returned To find her fairer than their Gwenddolen,â Who, ere the coming of this loveliness, Divided all men's hearts with Gwenhwyvar:â Crowned beauty of the beautiful at Court, With Gwenhwyvar, and fair among the fair. Thus while he mused he thought he heard her voice: Or was it fancy? teasing him with sounds Of music and of words: or did he hear Her lute below the creepered walls? whose leaves, Crimson with autumn, reddened all the court, Burning continual sunset, where she sat Beside the ceaseless whisper of the foam Of one faint fountain. Sweeter mockery Had never held him: and he heard her sing:â âAsk me not now to sing to thee Songs I have loved to sing before. I love thee not; it can not be: The dream is done; the song is o'er. âCome, hold my hands: look deep into The heartbreak of my eyes that bore Glad welcome erst and now adieu; Adieu, adieu forevermore! âOnce more shalt kiss my mouth and brow; Once more my hair,âas oft of yore When it was love and I and thou,â Then nevermore! ah, nevermore! âThou must not weep; I can not weep: I love thee not; should I regret?â Nay! go; forget my face and sleep, Sleep and forget! sleep and forget!â âAye! that I will! thy face, thy form, thy voice, O bird of spring! whose beak is in my heart. Take out thy beak, and sing me back my soul! O bird of spring,â he said, âwhen flowers are dead Thy wing will winter underneath the pine, And hunger, for the summer that is gone, Will slay thy music with the memory. God give thou find no winter in thy heart Whenas dost find the frost invades thy voice! Ah, lovelier than thy song, there's that in me That harps and sings of thee; that troubadours Thy beauty! ballades, sonnets it! and makes A lyric of each heart-beatâall in vain: Thou dost not heed, thou wilt not hear it sing. Or, if thou dost, 'tis but in wantonness, Indifference pretending interest: then praise, A moiety, in mockery. And this To one who'd love thee over all belief, Above all women and beyond all men.â She strummed her lute. He listened, and then laughed, âGod's life! our Dagonet might teach me sense, The folly that I am!âWhat? have I slept A sennight in the taking of the moon, Or danced, sleep-footed, with the forest fays?â One would imagine . . . No! . . . O silken Lust, O Wantonness! whose soft, voluptuous skirts Trail sweet contamination through these halls! O lawless Love, whose evil influence Haunts and parades Caerleon corridors! O Vanity and Falsehood, throned within The faithless Court, here is another soul, Fresh, fragrant, like a wild-flower of the woods, Ready and willing to be plucked and worn, And placed among those soiled and hothouse flowers, You long have worn, Isolt and Gwenhwyvar! The forest flower, innocent as yet,â The fairest, hence the more to be desired, The quickest, too, to wither,âwhose sweet name Is Angharad! . . . Ho! page! my horse! my mail!â God's wounds! my horse! my arms!âI will away!â And many knights he passed, nor saw; who asked What quest he rode. Inscrutable deeds behind His visor, and along his sullen spear Adventure bitter as a burning ray, Into the night he galloped with the stars. And one lone night, two years thereafter,âlost Within a forest wilder than wild Dean; Where neither wind nor water shook the leaves, That hung as turned to stone above the moss And grass, that wrapped the scaly rocks, death-dry, And barren torrents; where he had not found Or man or hut, or slot of boar or deer, Through miles and miles of lamentable trees And twisted thorns; beneath the autumn moon,â (Pale as a nun's face seen in cloistered walks)â Above dead tree-tops, like the rugged rock Of melancholy cliffs, he saw wild walls Of some vague castle thrust gray battlements And hoary towers, like a wizard's dream. Great greedy weeds and burrs and briers packed Its moat and roadway: at the very gate Weeds higher than a man; their ancient stalks Devoured with the dust and spider-webs, Or smothered with the slime where croaked the toad. And Peredur against the portal rode, And with his spear-point beat upon its bolts A sounding minute. But no wolf-hound bayed; Only dull echoes of interior walls And hollow rock that arched the empty halls. And once again his truncheon shook the gate And roused a round-eyed owl that screamed and blinked, Like some fierce gargoyle, on the bartizan; And from a crevice, like an omen, hurled A frantic bat. And then he heard a grate, Concealed within the gloomy battlements, Slide slowly; and a lean, gaunt, red-haired youth, Lit with a link, addressed him. And he saw That famine had sunk hollows in his cheeks, And fixed gaunt misery in mouth and eyes. âWhat knight art thou?â he asked. âAnd whence dost come?ââ And Peredur replied, âFirst let me in. I am of Arthur's Court. Long have I ridd'n Through miles and miles of melancholy woods. The night begins to storm. And I would rest.â Then said the youth, sad mirth about his mouth, âRest shalt thou; yea: and since thou, haply, hast Fasted all day, thou shalt break bread with us.ââ Then he retired from the grated slide: Undid harsh chains and shot back stubborn bolts; And, stiff with rust, the snarling hinges swung. And Peredur rode armed into a court, Neglected, and pathetic with strewn leaves And offal, where the weed and wire-grass Creviced with wisps the loose and broken stones: And overhead, around the mournful walls, Huge oaks thrust ancient boughs of mistletoe And withered leaves, whose twisted wildness seemed The beckoning arms of hunger, and the hands, Hooked and distorted, darkly threatening, Of murder; enemies that, pitiless, Had laid long siege to that old forest hold. And he dismounted. And in clanking mail Strode down the hall. And in the hall beheld Youths, lean and auburn-haired, around the hearth; Some eighteen of an equal height, and clad Alike in dingy garments that looked worn And old. And these were like to him who first Had bid him welcome. And they greeted him And took his arms; and bade him to a seat. And then an inner door flung wide; and, lo, Five maidens, like five forest flowers, came; Dark-eyed, dark-haired. Behold, the queen of these Was Angharad. Clad in a ragged robe Of faded satin that had once been rich. She looked at Peredur, and he at her: And with glad eyes once more his soul beheld The hair far blacker than the bird that wings Athwart the milk-white moon: the matchless skin, Inviolably white as wind-flowers blown Among the mighty gospels of the trees: And in her cheeks, the rose of maidenhood Red as round berries winter bushes dot The dimpled drift with under loaded boughs. She knew him not, or seemed to; or forgot To speak his name whenas she looked at him And, blushing, welcomed. And they sat and talked Until the night waxed late. And as they talked He marked that hunger had made hollow haunts Of all their eyes; and so he longed to ask, But courtesy forbade him. Late it grew, And late and later; and at last there came A knocking, and, as shadowy as two ghosts, Two nuns came gliding; sandalled silence in Frail footsteps, and pale caution on pale lips. One brought a jar of wine, and one brought bread, Six loaves of wheaten flour. And these said, âGod bear us witness, Lady, this is all! Now is our Convent barren as thy board;â And so departed. And they sat and ate. The wind upon the forest and the rain Upon the turrets. Had he heard a sigh Or was it but the echo of his own, Born of great weariness, that broke his rest?â A dream! a dream!âThe autumn storm is on, And sows the wood with witchcraft, and the leaves Are chased by imps of darkness through the hail And hurling rain. The wind is wild with leaves. Again he slept. The rain among the trees, The wind upon the turrets. Had he moaned, Now that he lay awake and heard the wind Hoot on the towers like a green-eyed owl? The rain and wind. The night is black with rain. Within the forest like a voice the wind; And on the turrets, like swift feet, the rain. Now was he sure 'twas weeping; and arose, And found her at his door; and took her hand, That like a soft persuasion lay in his. He felt long sobbings shake it. And he said, âTell me, my sister, wherefore dost thou weep?â And Angharad, âYea; I will tell it thee.â My name is Angharad. My father held An Earldom under Arthur, yea, the first In all his Kingdom: and this Castle, too, Was his with cantrevs to the west and east. When I was but a girl Earl Addanc met And loved me. Once, when hunting, he came here And sought my father and demanded me. He said he loved me, and would have but me To grace his bed and board, this Earl! But Iâ I did not love him, being but a child, My father's only child; I could not love. And so my father said this should not be. The Earl was wroth. I heard his furious stride Beneath my casement; double demons pinched His evil eyes and twenty gnarled his face. He cursed us ere he rode beyond our walls Then to Caerleon was I sent; and there Became a woman of young Gwenhwyvar, Until my father's death two years agone, When I returned, a Countess, to find war And Addanc here around beleaguered walls. So hath he stripped me of my appanage; Save this one keep, whose strength hath held out long, Manned by my foster brothers, brave and young, Strong to endure, but lacking still in arms; No match for knights like Addanc. Thou hast met The eighteen youths whose valor will not yield. But what avail their valor and their will Against hard hunger, now our larder lacks, And lacks the Convent, too, whereon we leaned? And Addanc comes to-morrow morn; the truce For our one day's deliberation done. If he prevailâthe thought is like hot hands Here on my brain!âhis oath is âthat the night Shall see me given over to his grooms.ââ She wept with tremblings. Then said Peredur: âGo, dry thy tears, my sister. And this Earlâ If he be early, call me not too late. Fear not. I will not go until my sword Hath crossed the sword of so much wickedness, And proved this base ambition. Go and sleep.â A morning gray with mist that gathered drops Of drizzle on the ever dripping leaves. And then the mist divided: ghostly mail, Spears and limp pennons, and the shadowy steeds Of shadowy knights and chieftains. And it seemed A host of phantoms come to lay dim siege To phantom walls whose warriors were ghosts. Afar a bugle flourished in the fog, Disconsolate; no echo of the wood To bear its music burden. To the moat Advanced a herald. And within the wall The grate was opened; and the gaunt-eyed youth Held parley with him: âHow the Earl would make End of the long dispute to-day, and leave, 'Twixt three a single combat to decide.â So Peredur bade arm him, and prepare His horse for battle; and bade give the Earl His answer for the Castle: âThat one knight Would try the hauberks of the banded three.â And he rode forth: and one rode up and scoffed,â A knight in russet armor with loud words,â âSmall means to large results, forsooth! Thou boast! A vicious palate hath thy appetite That feasted long with hunger and must now Conclude the banquet with three deaths!âSir Death, Here is thy death!â and hacked at Peredur A heavy stroke that gashed his chain camail. But, rising in stiff stirrups, ere he passed, Two-handed swung the sword of Peredur, And helm and head of him who fell were twain, Halved like an apple. And the walls were glad. Then came another, clad in silver mail, As he were Galahad; and in the mist Glimmered like moonlight. And with levelled spear Demanded: âWhence and what art thou? this stroke Was never fathered by long fasting.ââThen Quoth Peredur, âI am Arthur's Court.ââ Then sneered the other with a mocking laugh, âA goodly service truly that of his, Since all his knights, whom I have met, have died!ââ Quoth Peredur: âThy falsehood choke thee dead! Within thy throat thus do I nail thy lie!â And at his gorget hurled his ponderous spear, Ere that one met him, spurring at full speed, Disdainful. And the desperate stroke of him Who had wrought havoc with the Table Round, Glanced shattering from the sloping shield, while he, Bent backwards o'er his saddle, rolledâhis tongue Cleft at the root. And all the walls were glad. Now came a third: a black knight and a black Enormous steed. No words he wasted. But, The fierce spears splintered, from the baldrics burned Swift blades: and Battle held his breath a while To see the great shields rock beneath great blows, Oppose, deploy, as hilt to hilt they hewed At heaume and gorget. While the conflict dripped Between the splintered greaves from many wounds. Then Peredur, his whole strength wrenching at Unyielding shelter of his foeman's shield, Beat down his guard and smote.âAnd Addanc lay Beneath the son of Evrawc, whose swift hands Razed off his casque and laid a blind blade bare Across hot eyes, and set a heel of steel Upon his throat and said: âThou coward curse! What woman wilt thou war with now?â'Tis well Thy features are thus evil and might breed Nightmares among the kestrels, kites, and crows, Else hadst thou been, ere this,âso says my sword,â A head the shorter! and that head hung high Upon the highest battlement. What now! What wilt thou do for thy vile life? what now! Speak! or I smite! O thou base villainy, Out on thy ugly mouth!âSpeak!â Cursing, he, A stricken bulk, growled, âLet me live! And I, Upon my knighthood, swear that I will make Unto this woman, Angharad, returns For all her losses. Let me live.ââAnd so The sword slid from his eyes and from his neck The heel. And he aroseâto make in full Due restitution of her lands to her He had so robbed and harassed. And in time This was fulfilled. But Peredur remained,â For, to be near her and to do for her Was all his happiness,âuntil the land Acknowledged her with all obedience. Her rights established, what more now remained To lend excuse unto his long delay?â And so he went to her, and led her from Amid her maidens, and bespoke her how âHe would ride hence and would but say farewell.â A while she gazed at him. And when she spoke The springs of tears seemed starting in her throat, Crystal and quivering. But with steady gaze, âDost thou, my knight, desire then to go? Methought that thou wouldst tarry yet a while.â A little while.âWell hast thou fought for me.â A moment was he silent; turning then, Ground iron strides along the lofty hall, And so returned with iron strides and said: âAy, by my God! Who knows I have not fought For thee but still against thee. 'Tis my curse, To love thee, love thee, love thee all these years!â I came not here to woo. Thou wouldst but laugh.â Haply thou hast forgotten meâthou hast!â Yea, hast forgotten, aye long, long ago, That son of Evrawc, Evrawc of the North, Who wooed thee once! . . . Hast memory of him yet? . . . Look in his eyes once more and say farewell.â âMy soul, my soul!â she said; âO my true soul! This shall not be, my soul!ââHe heard her low Voice pleading softly, and, deep in his heart, New life leapt up, and sang in every pulse, âShe loves me! yea, she loves me!ââAnd it seemed He heard her as men hear the voice of hope Upon despair's black brink; and see one star Bloom, like a lily with a heart of fire Throbbing within it, slowly out of night. Each syllable the petal of a flower, A rose of music, welcome as the star, The first the eve gives silvery utterance to; Or as the firstling bud, the wildwood rose, Dropped from the rosy lips of laughing Spring;â âI have remembered. Think'st thou I have not?â O son of Evrawc, thou who couldst not see, 'Neath bells of folly and a merry mask, A girl's dear secret through her tinsel acts.â Or was thy love but fancy?âAh, too soon, I heard the vapid ending of a tale Coquetry had begun for other end.â But, if thou wilt, we can resume the tale; The beautiful story of true love.âTell on! Tell on, my heart! Or have we reached the end? And is it wedlock?âBoth were wrong. The one: Because his love was blind, impetuous, Nor saw the love that would have proved 'twas love, Not lust, before surrender. The other: that She sought for wisdom in the frivolous, And so made falsehood of her dearest truth, Deceived more than deceiving.âWilt thou go?â He had no rhetoric to make reply: Only his arms about her, and his eyes Upon her eyes, and kisses on her mouth. Long time they stood.âOutside, the sunset flung Barbaric glory in the autumn wood.â And lifting up her face he said to her: âHast thou thy lute still? Then come sing to me; That song again, that pleased me once so illâ Two years ago at parting. If it please No better now, straightway I will depart, Andâthou with me. Yea, on one steed, if needs, We will ride forth together to the Queen, To old Caerleon, and King Arthur's Court; And Gwenhwyvar shall kiss thee and confess Thou art her loveliest flower, my own wild rose, And give thee to me who will wear thee here.â ISOLT âBut when the queen, La beale Isoude heard these tidings shee made such sorrow that shee was full nigh out of her minde, and so upon a day she thought to slay herselfe, and never for to live after Sir Tristram's death.ââ Le Morte d'Arthure. I The wild dawn flares o'er wood and vale, O'er all the world she used to love: Low on her couch it finds her pale, The dawn that breaks with flame above. Her lute, that once was all her care, To which her love had often sung, Upon a damask-covered chair Now lies neglected and unstrung. Back from her face her hair she throws, Her heavy hair that falls and slips, Then, rising, to the casement goes With languid eyes and pallid lips. II With feverish face from morn till noon, And noon to middle-night she stoops From her high lattice; late and soon In search for him among the troops That come and go or loiter by. For there had come a dame, in garb Of pearls and samite, green of dye, A stately woman on a barb, From Camelot, who, looking round, Had sneered, â'Mid herdsmen and such craft This Tristram lives like any hound.â Then as she shook her curls and laughed, And flashed on Isolt looks of scorn, Trailing her glimmering jewels past, âI met a madman yestermorn Within the forest. Wild, aghast He stood, all naked in the rain, 'Twas Tristram, he of Lyonesse, A good knight once, but nowââ Again She laughed, then sneered.âAnd one might guess The thing she hinted in disdain. III So Isolt watched now: long she leant From her high tower that hapless dawn: Above her bloomed the firmament, Below, the world was dewy wan. She saw a long lake where the stags Came down to drink: and woods of pines Beyond which mountains loomed, whose crags,â Gaunt guardians of Mark's boundary lines,â Gray watch-towers, hawk-like, overhung; And 'mid the pines, wild, ivy-clung, She saw a castle lift its old Green walls of ruin, now a cave For bandits, and a robber-hold Of lust, beside a torrent's wave. Then o'er a bridge, whose granite arched The torrent's foam, she saw a knight,â Behind whom spear-armed followers marched,â Like Galahad, in glittering white, Ride from the forest-covered height. IV High on a barb whose trappings shone Inlaid with a laton, gold of hue, Star-bright amid the dawn and dew; Proud on his lordly-stepping roan He rode, and seemed of chivalry The star, until he stood alone Before the Court and spoke his lie, And said,â(for him, too, heart and tongue, Mark's gold had bought)ââI saw him die. Alas! for one so brave and young! But better so than still to be A madman and a mockery!ââ Then smiled around the questioning Court As one who brought no ill report. . . . And she believed. And front to front With all her misery that eve,â Which, sombre-visaged, o'er the mount, Above Day's burning bier did grieve And bow her melancholy star,â With tearful eyes she watched the light Streak all the heaven with blood afar; And lingered far into the night, Lamenting at her casement-bar. V âOh, I'm like one who o'er her light, Her lamp of love, bends down, when, lo! All on a sudden, out of night, Dashing it down, there comes a blow That leaves all darkness; and she hears A demon whispering in the gloom, That shuts her in with all her fears,â So thought she, lonely in her room. Then took her lute and touched such airs As Tristram loved, sad songs of BreÃ¶n, She once had heard, all unawares, Sir Launcelot sing in old CaerleÃ¶n, To Guinevere upon the stairs, The terrace stairs, beside the Usk, Deep in the nightingale-haunted dusk. Then ceased, and wept until the stars, Seen through her tears, made heaven all tears, On fire with tears, that left their scars Upon its face; and all the years Of grief and love seemed in their spheres: And reaching out her arms she cried, âO God! O God! that I had died! O Tristram! Tristram! art thou near? O love, be near me in this hour! This hour of anguish and of fear! Which,â(like yon fountain's ceaseless foam, Unseen, beneath this starlit tower, Deep in the shadow of its dome),â Throbs on and on within my life, The utter darkness of its woe.â O hour of grief! O hour of strife! Why must my young heart suffer so? Why must my sick soul sigh and sigh, And God not hear nor let me die?â VI When rose the moon, and far away A nightingale beneath the tower, Heard through the fountain's falling spray, Made lonelier yet that lonely hour; And 'twixt the nodding grove and lake A glimmering fawn stalked through the night, And snuffed the wind, then bent to slake Its thirst; she veiled her face,âas white As death's,âand said: âThe way is clear! There is no use in waiting here! Come! let me cure this heart that bursts! This pain is more than I can bear!â Come! let me still this soul that thirsts! . . . Upon the lake, as thick as stars In heav'n, the lilies lie asleep.â There lies a way beyond these bars, These walls of flesh that hold and keep! The nightingale shall find its mate, The fawn its fellow, and must I, The spouse of grief, the wife of hate, Live on alone until I die?â How long, how long, O God, to wait!â . . . Far through the darkness went her cry. THE DREAM OF SIR GALAHAD With the knights Peredur and Gawain he sits, in a chapel in Lyonesse, speaking while the dawn slowly reddens on the sea, gray-seen through the open door. I Cast on sleep there came to me Three great angels, o'er the sea Moaning near the priory: Cloudy clad in awful white, Each one's face, a lucid light, Rayed and blossomed out of night. II In my sleep I saw them rest, Each, a long hand on her breast, Like the new-moon in the west: And their hair like sunset rolled Down their shoulders, burning cold, An insufferable gold. III Flaming round each high brow bent Fourfold starry gold, that sent Light before them as they went: 'Neath their burning crowns their eyes Shone like awful stars the skies Rock in shattered storm that flies. IV Dark their eyes were, lurid dark; And within their eyes a spark Like the opal's burned: my sark Seemed to shrivel 'neath their gaze; As, with marvel and amaze, All my soul it seemed to raise. V And I saw their mouths were fire, Ruby-red as the desire Of the Sanc Graal: fair and dire Were their lips, whereon the kiss Of all Heaven lay; the bliss Of all happiness that is. VI Calm as Beauty lying dead, Tapers lit at feet and head, Were they, round whom prayers seemed said: Fragrant as that woman who, Born of blossoms and of dew And of magic, wedded Llew. VII And the first one said to me:â âThou hast slept thus holily While seven sands ran shadowy; Earth hath served thee like a slave, Serving us who found thee brave, Pure of life and great to save: VIII âKnow!ââShe touched my brow: a pain As of arrows pierced my brain: Ceased: and earth, both sea and plain, Vanished: and I stood where thought Stands, and worship, spirit-fraught, Watching how the heavens are wrought. IX Then the second said to me: âThou hast come all sinlessly Thro' life's sin-enveloped sea: Know the things thou hast not seen: Filling all the soul with sheen; Meaning more than earth may mean: X âSee!ââHer voice sang like a lyre, Comprehending all desire In its gamut's throbbing fire:â And my inner eyelids,âwhich Dimmed clairvoyance,âraised: and rich, As one chord's vibrating pitch, XI Grew my soul with light: that saw The embodiment of awe, Love, divinity, and law, Orbed and eÃ¶ned: and the power, Circumstance, like some vast flower; From which time fell, hour on hour. XII 'Neath the third one's mighty will All my soul lay very still, Feeling all its being thrill As she, smiling, said to me: âThou dost know, and thou canst see: What thou art arise and be!â XIII To my lips her lips she pressed; And my new-born soul, thrice-blessed, Clasped her radiance and caressed: Mounted and, in glory clad, Soared with them who chorused glad: âChrist awaits thee, Galahad!â AFTER THE TOURNAMENT The good Knight, Sir Lionell de Ganis, wounded unto death, addresses his Lady, Evalott, in the Forest of Dean, whither he has been borne on his shield. I And shall it be, when white thorns flake With blossoms all the Maytime brake, The rustle of a flower or leaf Will let thee know That I am near thee, as thy grief, As long ago? II Or shall it be, when blows and dies The wood-anemone, two eyes Will gaze in thine, as faint as frost? And thou, in dreams, Wilt hear the sigh of one long lost, Who near thee seems. III Or shall it be, where waters soothe The stillness, thou wilt hear the smooth Dim notes of a familiar lute, And in thine ears Old Provence melodies, long mute, Like falling tears? . . IV Now doff my helm.âLoop thy white arm Beneath my hair. So. Let thy warm Blue eyes gaze in mine for a space, A little while . . . Love, it will rest me . . . And thy faceâ Ah, let it smile. V Now art thou thou. Yetâlet thy hair, A golden wonder, fall; thy fair Full throat bend low; thy kiss be hot With love, not dry With anguish.âSweet, my Evalott! Now let me die. THE DARK TOWER âChilde Rowland to the dark tower came.â âKing Lear. The hills around were iron, The sky, a boundless black, Where wells of the lightning opened And boiled with blazing rack, When he came to the giant castle, The wild rain on his back. Huge in the night and tempest, Over the cataract's bed, Its windows, ulcers of fire, Its gate, a hell-lit red, The Dark Tower loomed; and wildly A voice sang overhead. Thrice, under its warlock turrets, Where the causeway of rock was laid; Thrice, there at its owlet portal, His scornful bugle brayed; And the drawbridge clanged at his summons, And he rode in unafraid. The heavens were riven asunder, One glare of blinding storm; And the blackness, chasmed with thunder, Blazed form on demon form, As he rode in the court of the castle, The shield upon his arm. His sword unsheathed and open The vizor of his casque, Childe Rowland entered the donjon His gauntlet should unmask: But naught, save night and silence, He found, and none to ask. His heel on the stair crashed iron, His hand on the door clashed steelâ In the hall, the roar of the torrent, In the turret, the thunder's pealâ And there in the highest turret She sat at a spinning-wheel. She spun the flax of a spindle, All in a magic space; She spun with her head bent downward, His Lady, fair of face; She spun, all wildly singing, All spellbound in that place. Again, when he gazed on her beauty, The heart in his breast was wax; Again, when he heard her singing, The thews of his limbs grew laxâ She spun, nor saw him, spinning A spindle of blood-red flax. And now the flax was fire, That wrapped her, skein on skein; And now a flaming serpent, And now a blazing chain; But he seized the enchanted spindle, And all its spells were vain. She looked upon Childe Rowland, And never a word she said, But kissed his mouth and forehead, And leaned on his breast her head . . . She smiled upon Childe Rowland, And into the night they fled. THE BLIND HARPER And so it came that I was led To wizard walls that haggard hung Old as their rock, black-mossed and dead, Wild-swarmed with towers; and, flaming flung Around them,âfar, a moat of red,â A million poppies sprung. And here I harped.âAll seemed asleep; Till, hoarse beneath, harsh hinges gnarred And iron clanged within the Keep: And then from one gaunt casement, barred With night, a woman, dim and deep, Gazed at me long and hard. To her I sang. And as she leaned In beauty to me, dark and tall, And loud I sang of Love, I gleaned An inkling of her Court withal: For, lo, above her, watched a Fiend, Wolf-eyeballed, on the wall. Still, still I sang. And then she laughed, Laughed loud and long and evilly; And in her face I saw was craft And hate and all the sins that be: And overhead, with pointed shaft, The Fiend glared down on me. Still, still I harped. Then up she leapt, When loud I sang of Ermengard, The Queen of Love, whose Court is kept At Anjou, I, who am her bard! And from her side a raven swept, While loud she laughed and hard. Its iron beak had pierced my eyes Before my mind had half divined That those wild walls that touched the skies With Hell-built towers, terror-lined, Were Lilith's,âmother of lusts and lies,â Love's foe, who left me blind. CHILDE RONALD Childe Ronald rode adown the wood, His spear upon his knee; When, lo, he saw a girl who stood Beneath an old oak tree. And when Childe Ronald saw her there, So fair and fresh of hueâ âTen tire-maids wait to comb thy hair, And ten to latch thy shoe; âA gown of sendal, gold and pearl, And pearls for neck and earââ âBut I am but a low-born girl Who wait my lover here!â Childe Ronald took her by the hand And drew her to his sideâ âThou shalt be a Lady of the land.â Now mount by me and ride.â She needs must mount; and through the wood They rode unto the sea: When in his towers at last she stood A pale-faced girl was she. âUnbusk, unbusk her, tire-girls! Take off these rags,â quoth he; âAnd clothe her body in silk and pearls, And red gold, neck and knee.â They busked her in a shift of silk, And in a samite gown: They looped her throat with pearls like milk, And crowned her with a crown. They brought her in unto the priestâ She saw nor priest nor groom:â They married her and made a feast, Then led her to her room. . . . âUnbusk, unbusk me, tire-maids, Now it hath come to lie. Comb down my locks in simple braids, A simple maid am I. âUnbusk, unbusk me, handmaidens; Long will I lie a-bed: And when Childe Ronald lies by me, 'Twill be when I am dead. âWhen I am cold and dead, sweethearts, And song be turned to sighâ No love of mine hath he, sweethearts, And a wretched bride am I. âA harper harped in the banquet hall; An ancient man was he; The song he sang was sweet to all, But it was sad to me. âHe sang and harped of a maiden fair, Whose face was like the morn, Who gave her lover a token there Beneath the trysting thorn. âHe harped and sang of a damosel Who swore she would be true: And then of a heart as false as Hell, He cursed with curses two. âAnd at the first curse, note for note, My roses turned to rue: Or ever the second curse he smote No more of earth I knew. âAnd, âSee!â they cried, âher eyes, how wide! And, lo, her faceâhow wan!ââ And they shall see me paler-eyed Or ever the night be gone! âUnbusk, unbusk me, tire-maids, For now 'tis time to lie. Let down my locks in simple braids, A simple maid am I.â . . . And there is wonder and there is wail, And pale is every guest; Childe Ronald, too, is pale, is pale, Far paler than the rest. The guests are gone: all wild and wan He saw the guests depart: But she is wanest of the wan, A dagger in her heart. Within the room Childe Ronald stands, Then sinks upon his kneesâ He stares with horror on his hands, Then rises up and flees. He rises from his knees with dread, He flies that room unblestâ Oh, can it be he sees the dead, The blood upon her breast? âNow saddle me my horse, my horse! For I must ride, must ride!ââ But by his sideâis it Remorse That follows, stride for stride? Within the wood, the dark pine-wood, He rides with closÃ©d earsâ But evermore the ceaseless thud Of following hoofs he hears. With close-shut eyes and down-bowed head He rides among the treesâ But evermore the restless dead There at his side he sees. And evermore the autumn blast Above him sobs and sighs, âWho rides so far, who rides so fast, With closÃ©d ears and eyes?â He hears it not: he gallops on: The rain cries in the treesâ âWho is this rides so wild and wan? And what is that he flees? âOh, who are they? and whither away? Oh, whither do they ride?ââ âAcross the world till Judgment Day, Childe Ronald and his bride!â MORGAN Le FAY In dim samite was she bedight, And on her hair a hoop of gold, Like foxfire, in the tawn moonlight, Was glimmering cold. With soft gray eyes she gloomed and glowered; With soft red lips she sang a song: What knight might gaze upon her face, Nor fare along? For all her looks were full of spells, And all her words, of sorcery; And in some way they seemed to say, âOh, come with me! âOh, come with me! oh, come with me! Oh, come with me, my love, Sir Kay!ââ How should he know the witch, I trow, Morgan le Fay? How should he know the wily witch, With sweet white face and raven hair? Who, through her art, bewitched his heart And held him there. Eftsoons his soul had waxed amort To wold and weald, to slade and stream; And all he heard was her soft word As one adream. And all he saw was her bright eyes, And her fair face that held him still: And wild and wan she led him on O'er vale and hill. Until at last a castle lay Beneath the moon, among the trees: Its gothic towers old and gray With mysteries. Tall in its hall an hundred knights In armor stood with glaive in hand: The following of some great king, Lord of that land. Sir Bors, Sir Balin, and Gawain, All Arthur's knights, and many mo; But these in battle had been slain Long years ago. But when Morgan with lifted hand Moved down the hall, they louted low: For she was Queen of Shadowland, That woman of snow. Then from Sir Kay she drew away, And cried on high all mockingly:â âBehold, sir knights, the knave I bring, Who lay with me. âBehold! I met him 'mid the furze: Beside him there he made me lie: Upon him, yea, there rests my curse: Now let him die!â Then as one man those shadows raised Their brands, whereon the moon glanced gray: And clashing all strode from the wall Against Sir Kay. And on his body, bent and bowed, The hundred blades as one blade fell: While over all rang long and loud The mirth of Hell. THE LADY OF THE HILLS Though red my blood hath left its trail For five far miles, I will not fail, As God in Heaven wills! The way was long through that black land.â With sword on hip and horn in hand, At last before thy walls I stand, O Lady of the Hills! No seneschal shall put to scorn The summons of my bugle-horn! No warder stern shall stay! Yea! God hath helped my strength too far, By bandit-caverned wood and scar, To give it pause now, or to bar My all-avenging way! This hope still gives my body strengthâ To kiss thy mouth and eyes at length Where all thy kin can see: Then, 'mid thy towers of crime and gloom, Sin-haunted as the Halls of Doom, To strike thee dead in that wild room Red-lit with revelry. Madly I rode; nor once looked back, Before my face the world reeled, black With nightmare wind and rain. Witch-lights flared by me on the fen; And through the forestâwas it then The eyes of wolves? or ghosts of men, That flamed and fled again? Still on I rode. My way was clear From that wild time when, spear to spear, Deep in the wind-torn wood, I met him! . . . Dead he lies beneath Your trysting oak. I clenched my teeth And rode. My wound scarce let me breathe, That filled my eyes with blood. And here I am. The blood may blind My eyesight still! . . . but I will find Thee through some inner eye! For GodâHe hath this thing in care!â Yea! I will kiss again thy hair, Then tell thee of thy leman there, And smite thee deadâand die. THE DEMON LOVER The moon looks cold On the withered wold; The wind blows fierce and free: The thin snow sifts And stings and drifts, Blown by the haunted tree. The gnarled tree groans; And sighs and moans, And shudders to its roots: Is it the fear Of a footstep near? Or the owl in its top that hoots? Is it a gust Of thin snow-dust, The wind sweeps from the plain?â Is it a breeze That wails and drees?â Christ sain thee, Floramane! The moon hangs white In the winter night: The wind blows fierce and free: And Floramane Her place hath ta'en Beneath the haunted tree. What is it whines? What is it shines With owlet-eldritch light?â With raven plume Forth from the gloom A man stalks, still and white. His face is dim; His sword swings grim; His long cloak flutters wide: His kiss falls bleak On her mouth and cheek, As he folds her to his side. What is it gleams? What is it streams So wan on Floramane?â The moonlit breeze? Or his heart, she sees Through the stab, like a burning stain? A PRINCESS OF THULE In a kingdom of mist and moonlight, Or ever the world was known, Past leagues of unsailed water There reigned a king whose daughter Was fair as a starry stone. The Northern Lights were daylight, And day was twilight there: The king was wise and hoary, And his daughter, like the glory Of seven kingdoms, fair. The day was dim as moonlight; The night was misty gray, With slips of dull stars, bluer Where the princess met her wooer, A page like the month of May. His face was white as moonlight, His hair, a crumpled gold: Oh, she was wise as youth is, And he was young as truth is, And the king was old, was old. When day grew out of the moonlight, Across the misty wold, A-hunting or a-hawking They rode, forever mocking The good gray king and old. At night, in mist and moonlight, Where hung the horns and whips, In courts to the kennels leading, Or where the hounds were feeding, He kissed her eyes and lips. They whispered in the moonlight, And kissed in moon and mist:â âEnough! we're done with hiding!ââ There came the old king riding, The hawk upon his wrist. Oh, fain was she and eager, And he was over fain;â âHis cup and couch are ready.ââ âThen let thy hand be steadyâ And he'll not wake again.â Is it the mist or moonlight? Or a dead face staring up?â The old king's couch was ready, And his daughter's hand was steady Giving the poisoned cup. THE DAUGHTER OF MERLIN For the mountains' hoarse greetings came hollow From stormy wind-chasms and caves; And I heard their wild cataracts wallow; Like monsters, the white of their waves: And that shadow said, âLo! you must follow! And our path is o'er myriads of graves.â Then I felt that the black earth was porous And rotten with dust and with bones; And I knew that the ground that now bore us Was cadaverous with death as with stones; And I saw burning eyes, heard sonorous And dolorous sighings and groans. But the night of the tempest and thunder, The might of the terrible skies, And the fire of Hell, that,âcoiled under The hollow Earth,âsmoulders and sighs, And the laughter of stars and their wonder, Mingled and mixed in her eyes. And we clombâand the moon, old and sterile, Clomb with us o'er torrent and scar: And I yearned for her oceans of beryl, Wan mountains and cities of spar: â'Tis not well,â then she said; âyou're in peril Of falling and failing your star.â And we clombâthrough a murmur of pinions, And rattle of talons and plumes; And a sense as of darkest dominions, Deep, lost, of the dead and their tombs, Swam round us, with all of their minions Of dreads and of dreams and of dooms. And we clombâtill we stood at the portal Of the uttermost point of the peak; And she led, with a step more than mortal, On, upward, where glimmered a streak, A star, a presence immortal, A planet, whose light was still weak. And we clombâtill the limbo of spirits Of lusts and of sorrows below Swung nebular; and we were near its Starred summit, its glory of glow. And we entered its light and could hear its White music of silence and snow. TRISTRAM TO ISOLT Yea, there are some who always seek The love that lasts an hour; And some who in love's language speak, Yet never know his power. Of such was I, who knew not what Sweet mysteries can rise Within the heart when 'tis its lot To love and realize. Of such was I, Isolt! till, lo, Your face on mine did gleam, And changed that world, I used to know, Into an evil dream. That world wherein, on hill and plain, Great blood-red poppies bloomed; Their hot hearts thirsty for the rain, And sleepily perfumed. Above, below, on every part, A crimson shadow lay; As if the red sun streamed athwart, And sunset was alway. I know not how; I know not when; I only know that there She met me in the haunted glen, A poppy in her hair. Her face seemed fair as Mary's is, That knows nor sin nor wrong; Her presence filled the silences As music fills a song. And she was clad like the Mother of God, As 'twere for Christ's sweet sake; But when she moved and where she trod A hiss went of a snake. Though seeming sinless, till I die I shall not know for sure Why to my soul she seemed a lie And otherwise than pure. Nor why I kissed her soon and late, And for her felt desire, While loathing of her passion ate Into my heart like fire. Was it because my soul could tell That, like the poppy-flower, She had no soul? a thing of Hell, That o'er mine had no power. Or was it that your love at last, My soul so long had craved, From that sweet sin which held me fast At that last moment, saved? THE KNIGHT-ERRANT The witch-elm shivers in the gale; The thorn-tree's top is bowed: The night is black with rain and hail, And mist and cloud. The winds, upon the woods and fields, Are swords two fiends unsheathe, Two fiends, that snarl behind their shields And grind their teeth. The foxfire, in the marshy place, As he rides on and on, Gleams, ghastly as a deadman's face, And then is gone. The owl shrieks from the splintered pine Demonic ridicule: He hears the werewolf howl and whine And lap the pool. Black bats beat blindly by his eyes, Like Death's own horrible hands: His quest leads under haunted skies To haunted lands. He rides with fire upon his casque, And fire upon his spear, The roadway of his soul's set task, Without a fear. Right steels the sinews of his steed, And tempers his straight sword: He rides the causeway of his creed Without a word. No man shall make the iron pause In gauntlet and in thew: He rides the highway of his cause To die or do. His purpose leads him, like a flame, Through forest and through fen, To castle walls of wrong and shame And blood-stained men. Hope's are the lips that wind the horn Before the gates of lust: Though fifty dragons hiss him scorn, Still will he trust. Strength's is the hand that thunders at The entrances of night: Though ten-score demons crush him flat Still will he fight. Love's is the heart that finds a way To dungeons vast of sin: A thousand deaths may rise to slay, Still will he win. THE FORESTER I met him here at Ammendorf one spring. It was the end of April and the Harz, Treed to their ruin-crested summits, seemed One pulse of tender green and delicate gold, Beneath a heaven that was like the face Of girlhood waking into motherhood. Along the furrowed meadow, freshly ploughed, The patient oxen, loamy to the knees, Plodded or lowed or snuffed the fragrant soil; And in each thorn-tree hedge the wild bird sang A song to spring, full of its own wild self And soul, that heard the blossom-laden May's Heart beating like a star at break of day, As, kissing red the roses, she drew near, Her mouth's ripe rose all dewdrops and perfume. Here at this inn and underneath this tree We took our wine, the morning prismed in its Flame-crystalled gold.âA goodly vintage that! Tang with the ripeness of full twenty years. Rare! I remember! wine that spurred the blood, That brought the heart glad to the songful lip, And made the eyes unlatticed casements whence A man's true soul smiled, breezy as the blue. As royal a Rhenish, I will vouch to say, As that, old legends tell, which Necromance And Magic keep, gnome-guarded, in huge casks Of antique make deep in the KyffhÃ¤user, Webbed, frosty gray, with salt-petre and mold, The Cellar of the Knights near Sittendorf.â So solaced by that wine we sat an hour He told me his intent in coming here. His name was Rudolf; and his native place, Franconia; but no word of parentage: Only his mind to don the buff and green And live a forester with us and be Enfellowed in the Duke of Brunswick's train, And for the Duke's estate even now was bound. Tall was he for his age and strong and brown, And lithe of limb; and with a face that seemed Hope's counterpartâbut with the eyes of doubt: Deep stealthy disks, instinct with starless night, That seemed to say, âWe're sure of Earthâat least For some short while, my friend; but afterwardâ Nay! ransack not to-morrow till to-day Lest it engulf thy joy before it is!ââ And when he spoke, the fire in his eyes Worked restless as a hunted animal's; Or like the Count von Hackelnburg's,âthe eyes Of the Wild Huntsman,âhis that turn and turn Feeling the unseen presence of a fiend. And then his smile! a thrust-like thing that curled His lips with heresy and incredible lore When Christ's or th' Virgin's holy name was said, Exclaimed in reverence or admonishment: And once he sneered,ââWhat is this God you mouth, Employ whose name to bless yourselves or damn? A curse or blessing?âIt hath passed my skill T' interpret what He is. And then your faithâ What is this faith that helps you unto Him? Distinguishment unseen, design unlawed. Why, earth, air, fire, and water, heat and cold, Hint not at Him: and man alone it is Who needs must worship something. And for meâ No God like that whom man hath kinged and crowned! Rather your Satan cramped in Hellâthe Fiend! God-countenanced as he is, and tricked with horns. No God for me, bearded as Charlemagne, Throned on a tinsel throne of gold and jade, Earth's pygmy monarchs imitate in mien And mind and tyranny and majesty, Aping a God in a sonorous Heaven. Give me the Devil in all mercy then, Bad as he is! for I will none of such!â And laughed an oily laugh of easy jest To bow out God and let the Devil in. Then, as it chanced, old Kurt had come that morn With some six of his jerkined foresters From the Thuringian forest; wet with dew, And fresh as morn with early travel; bound For Brunswick, Dummburg and the Hakel passed. Chief huntsman he then to our lord the Duke, And father of the loveliest maiden here In Ammendorf, the sunny Ilsabe: Her mother dead, the gray-haired father prized His daughter more than all that men hold dear; His only happiness, who was beloved Of all as Lora of Thuringia was, For gentle ways that spoke a noble soul, Winning all hearts to love her and to praise, As might a great and beautiful thought that holds Us by the simplest words.âBlue were her eyes As the high glory of a summer day. Her hair,âserene and braided over brows White as a Harz dove's wing,âan auburn brown, And deep as mists the sun has drenched with gold: And her young presence, like embodied song, Filled every heart she smiled on with sweet calm, Like some Tyrolean melody of love, Heard on an Alpine path at close of day When homing shepherds pipe to tinkling flocks: Being with you a while, so, when she left,â How shall I say it?â'twas as when one hath Beheld an Undine on the moonlit Rhine, Who, ere the mind adjusts a thought, is gone, And to the soul it seems it was a dream. Some thirty years ago it was;âand I, Commissioner of the Dukeâ(no sinecure I can assure you)âhad scarce reached the age Of thirty,âthat we sat here at our wine; And 't was through me that Rudolf,âwhom at first, From some rash words dropped then in argument, The foresterhood was like to be denied,â Was then enfellowed. âYes,â said I, âhe's young. Kurt, he is young: but look you! what a man! What arms! what muscles! what a faceâfor deeds! An eyeâthat likes me not; too quick to turn!â But that may be the restless soul within: A soul perhaps with virtues that have been Severely tried and could not stand the test; These be thy care, Kurt: and if not too deep In vices of the flesh, discover them, As divers bring lost riches up from ooze.â Thou hast a daughter; let him be thy son.â A year thereafter was it that I heard Of Rudolf's passion for Kurt's Ilsabe; Then their betrothal. And it was from this,â (How her fair memory haunts my old heart still!â Sweet Ilsabe! whose higher womanhood, True as the touchstone which philosophers feign Transmutes to gold base metals it may touch, Had turned to good all evil in this man,)â Surmised I of the excellency which Refinement of her purer company, And contact with her innocence, had resolved His fiery nature to, conditioning slave. And so I came from Brunswickâas, you know, Is custom of the Duke or, by his seal Commissioned proxy, his commissionerâ To test the marksmanship of Rudolf, who Succeeded Kurt with marriage of his child, An heir of Kuno.âHe?âGreat-grandfather To Kurt; and of this forest-keepership The first possessor; thus established hereâ Or this the tale they tell on winter nights:â Kuno, once in the Knight of Wippach's train, Rode on a grand hunt with the Duke, who came,â Grandfather of the father of our Duke,â With much magnificence of knights and squires, Great velvet-vestured nobles, cloaked and plumed, To hunt Thuringian deer. Then morn,âso rathe To bid good-morrow to the husbandman Heavy with slumber,âwas too slow for these, And on the wind-trod hills recumbent yawned Aroused an hour too soon: ashamed, disrobed, Rubbed the stiff sleep from eyes that still would close; Like some young milkmaid whom the cock hath waked, Who sits within her loft and, half asleep, Stretches and hears the house below her stir, Yet sits and yawns, reluctant still to rise.â Horns sang and deer-hounds tugged a whimpering leash, Or, loosened, bounded through the baying glens: And ere the mountain mists, compact of white, Broke wild before the azure spears of day, The far-off hunt, that woke the woods to life, Seemed but the heart-beat of the ancient hills. And then, near noon, within a forest brake, The ban-dogs roused a red gigantic stag, Lashed to whose back with gnarly-knotted cords, And borne along like some pale parasite, A man shrieked: tangle-bearded, and his hair A mane of forest-burrs. The man himself, Emaciated and half-naked from The stag's mad flight through headlong rocks and trees, One bleeding bruise, his eyes two holes of fire. For such the law then: when the peasant chased Or slew the dun deer of his tyrant lords, If caught, as punishment the withes and spine Of some strong stag, a gift to him of game Enough till deathâdeath in the antlered herd, Or slow starvation in the haggard hills. Then was the great Duke glad, and forthwith cried To all his hunting-train a rich reward For him who slew the stag and saved the man, But death for him who slew both man and beast. So plunged the hunt after the hurrying slot, A shout and glimmer through the sounding woods,â Like some wild torrent that the hills have loosed, Death for its goal.â'Twas late; and none had yet Risked that hard shot,âtoo desperate the risk Beside the poor life and a little gold,â When this young Kuno, with hot eyes, wherein Hunt and impatience kindled reckless flame, Cried, âHas the dew made wet each powder-pan? Or have we left our marksmanship at home? Here's for its heart! the Fiend direct my ball!ââ And fired into a covert packed with briers, An intertangled wall of matted night, Wherein the eye might vainly strive and strive To pierce one fathom, gaze one foot beyond: But, ha! the huge stag staggered from the brake, Heart-hit, and fell: and that wan wretch, unbound, Rescued, was cared for. Then his grace, the Duke, Charmed with the eagle aim, called Kuno up, And there to him and his forever gave The forest-keepership. But envious tongues Were soon at wag; and whispered went the tale Of how the shot was âfreeâ; and how the balls Used by young Kuno were âfreeâ bulletsâwhich To say is: Lead by magic molded, in The presence and directed of the Fiend. Of some effect these tales, and of some force Even with the Duke, who lent an ear so far As to ordain Kuno's descendants all To proof of skill ere their succession to The father's office. Kurt himself hath shot The silver ring out o' the popinjay's beakâ A good shot he, you see, who would succeed. The Devil guards his secrets close as God. For who can say what elementaries, Demonic, lurk in desolate dells and hills And shadowy woods? malignant forces who, Malicious vassals of satanic power, Are agents to that Evil none may name, Who signs himself, through these, a slave to those, Those mortals who call in the aid of Hell, And for some earthly, transitory gift, Barter their souls and all their hopes of Heaven. Of these enchanted bullets let me speak: There may be such: our earth hath things as strange, Perhaps, and stranger, that we doubt not of, While we behold,ânot only 'neath the thatch Of Ignorance's hovel,âbut within The stately halls of Wisdom's palaces, How Superstition sits an honored guest. A cross-way, so they say, among the hills; A cross-way in a solitude of pines; And on the lonely cross-way you must draw A bloody circle with a bloody sword; And round the circle, runic characters, Weird and symbolic: here a skull, and there A scythe, and cross-bones, and an hour-glass here: And in the centre, fed with coffin-wood, Stolen from the grave ofâsay a murderer, A fitful fire. Eleven of the clock The first ball leaves the moldâthe sullen lead Mixed with three bullets that have hit their mark, And blood the wounded Sacramental Host, Stolen, and hence unhallowed, oozed when shot Fixed to a riven pine. Ere midnight strike, With never a word until that hour sound, Must all the balls be cast; and these must be In number three and sixty; three of which The Fiend's dark agent, demon Sammael, Claims for his master and stamps for his own To hit aside their mark, askew for harm. The other sixty shall not miss their mark. No cry, no word, no whisper, even though Vague, gesturing shapes, that loom like moonlit mists, Their faces human but of animal form, Whinnying and whining lusts, faun-faced, goat-formed, Rise thick around and threaten to destroy. No cry, no word, no whisper should there come, Weeping, a wandering shadow like the girl You love, or loved, now lost to you, her eyes Hollow with tears; sad, palely beckoning With beautiful arms, or censuring; her face Wild with despondent love: who, if you speak Or waver from that circleâhideous change!â Shrinks to a wrinkled hag, whose harpy hands Shall tear you limb from limb with horrible mirth. Nor be deceived if some far midnight bell Strike that anticipated hour; nor leave By one short inch the circle, for, unseen Though now they be, Hell's minions still are there, Watching with flaming eyes to seize your soul. But when the hour of midnight sounds, will come A noise of galloping hoofs and outriders, Shouting: six midnight steeds,âtheir nostrils, pits Of burning blood,âpostilioned, roll a stage, Black and with groaning wheels of spinning fire: âRoom there!âWhat, ho!âWho bars the mountain way?â On over him!ââBut fear not, nor fare forth; 'Tis but the last trick of your bounden slave. And ere the red moon rushes from the clouds And dives again, high the huge leaders leap, Their fore-hoofs flashing and their eyeballs flame, And, spun a spiral spark into the night, Hissing the phantasm flies and fades away. Some say there comes no stage; that Hackelnburg, Wild-Huntsman of the Harz, comes dark as storm, With rain and wind and demon dogs of Hell; The terror of his hunting-horn, an owl, And the dim deer he hunts, rush on before: The forests crash, and whirlwinds are the leaves, And all the skies a-thunder, as he hurls, Straight on the circle, horse and hounds and stag. And at the last, plutonian-cloaked, there comes,â Infernal fire streaming from his eyes,â Upon a stallion gaunt and lurid black, The minister of Satan, Sammael, Who greets you, and informs you, and assures. Enough! these wives' tales told, to what I've seen: To Ammendorf I came; and Rudolf here With Kurt and his assembled men in buff And woodland green were gathered at this inn. The abundant Yearâlike some sweet wife,âa-smile At her brown baby, Autumn, in her arms, Stood 'mid the garnered harvests of her fields Dreaming of days that pass like almoners Scattering their alms in minted gold of flowers; Of nights, that forest all the skies with stars, Wherethrough the moonâbare-bosomed huntressârides, One cloud before her like a flying fawn. Then I proposed the season's hunt; till eve The test of Rudolf's skill postponed; at which He seemed embarrassed. And 'twas then I heard How he an execrable marksman was; And tales that told of close, incredible shots, That missed their mark; or how the flint-lock oft Flamed harmless powder, while the curious deer Stood staring, as in pity of such aim, Or as inviting him to try once more. Howbeit, he that day acquitted him Of all this gossip; in that day's long hunt Missing no shot, however rashly made Or distant through the intercepting trees. And the piled, various game brought down of all Good marksmen of Kurt's train had not sufficed, Doubled, nay, trebled, there to match his heap. And marvelling the hunters saw, nor knew How to excuse them. My indulgence giv'n, Some told me that but yesterday old Kurt Had made his daughter weep and Rudolf frown, By vowing end to their bethrothÃ©d love, Unless that love developed better skill Against the morrow's test; his ancestors' High fame should not be tarnished. So he railed; Then bowed his gray head and sat moodily: But, looking up, forgave all when he saw Tears in his daughter's eyes and Rudolf gone Out in the night, black with approaching storm. Before this inn, crowding the green, they stood, The holiday village come to view the trial: Fair maidens and their comely mothers with Their sweethearts and their husbands. And I marked Kurt and his daughter here; his florid face All creased with smiles at Rudolf's great success; Hers, radiant with happiness; for this Her marriage eveâso had her father saidâ Should Rudolf come successful from the hunt. So pleased was I with what I'd seen him do, The trial of skill superfluous seemed; and so Was on the bare brink of announcing, when Out of the western heaven's deepening red,â Like a white message dropped of scarlet lips,â A wild dove clove the luminous winds and there, Upon that limb, a peaceful moment sat. Then I, âThy rifle, Rudolf! pierce its head!â Cried pointing, âand chief-forester art thou!â Why did he falter with a face as strange And strained as terror's? did his soul divine What was to be, with tragic prescience?â What a bad dream it all seems now!âAgain I see him aim. Again I hear her cry, âMy dove! O Rudolf, do not kill my dove!â And from the crowd, like some sweet dove herself, A fluttering whiteness, rushed our Ilsabeâ Too late! the rifle cracked. . . . The unhurt dove Rose, beating frightened wingsâbut Ilsabe! . . . My God! the sight! . . . fell smitten; sudden red, Sullying the whiteness of her bridal bodice, Showed where the ball had pierced her innocent heart. And Rudolf?âAh, of him you still would know? âWhen he beheld this thing which he had done, Why, he went madâI sayâbut others not. An hour he raved of how her life had paid For the unholy missiles he had used, And how his soul was three times lost and damned. I say that he went mad and fled forthwith Into the haunted Harz.âSome say, to die The prey of demons of the Dummburg ruin. I,âone of those less superstitious,âsay, He in the BodÃ©âfrom that blackened rock,â Whereon were found his hunting-cap and horn,â The Devil's Dancing Place, did leap and die. THE MOATED MANSE I And now once more we stood within the walls Of that old manor near the riverside; Dead leaves lay rotting in its empty halls, And here and there the ivy could not hide The year-old scars, made by the Royalists' balls, Around the doorway, where so many died In that last effort to defend the stair, When Rupert, like a demon, entered there. II The basest Cavalier who e'er wore spurs Or drew a sword, I count him; with his grave Eyes 'neath his plumed hat like a wolf's whom curs Rouse, to their harm, within a forest cave; And hair like harvest; and a voice like verse For smoothness. Ay, a handsome man andâbrave!â Brave?âwho would question it! yea! tho' 'tis true He warred with one weak woman and her few. III Lady Isolda of the Moated Manse, Whom here, that very noon, it happened me To meet near her old home. A single glance Showed me 'twas she. I marveled much to see How lovely still she was! as fair, perchance, As when Red Rupert thrust her brutally,â Her long hair loosened,âdown the shattered stair, And cast her, shrieking, 'mid his followers there. IV âShe is for you! Take her! I promised it! Take her, my bullies!ââshouting so, he flung Her in their midst. Then, on her poor hands (split, And beaten by his dagger when she clung Resisting him) and knees, she crept a bit Nearer his feet and begged for death. No tongue Can tell the way he turned from her and cursed, Then bade his men draw lots for which were first. V I saw it all from that low parapet, Where, bullet-wounded in the hip and head, I lay face-upward in the whispering wet, Exhausted 'mid the dead and left for dead. We had held out two days without a let Against these bandits. You could trace with red From room to room how we resisted hard Since the great door crashed in to their petard. VI The rain revived me, and I leaned with pain And saw her lying there, pale, soiled and splashed And miserable; on her cheek a stain, A dull red bruise, made when his mad hand dashed And struck her to the stones; the wretched rain Dripped from her dark hair; and her hands were gashed.â Oh, for a musket or a petronel With which to send his devil's soul to hell! VII But helpless there I lay, no weapon near, Only the useless sword I could not reach His traitor's heart with, while I chafed to hear The laugh, the insult and the villain speech Of him to her.âOh, God! could I but clear The height between and, hanging like a leech, My fingers at his throat, tear out his base Vile tongue! yea, tear, and lash it in his face! VIII But, badly wounded, what could I but weep With rage and pity of my helplessness And her misfortune! Could I only creep A little nearer so that she might guess I was not dead; that I my life would keep, Dedicate to revenge!âOh, the distress Of that last moment when, half-dead, I saw Them mount and bear her swooning through the shaw. IX Long time I lay unconscious. It befell Some woodsmen found me, having heard the sound Of fighting cease that, for two days, made hell Of that wild region; ventured on the ground For plunder: and it had not then gone well With me, I fear, had not their leader found That in some way I would repay his care; So bore me to his hut and nursed me there. X How roughly kind he was! For weeks I hung 'Twixt life and death; health, like a varying, sick And fluttering pendulum, now this way swung, Now that, until at last its querulous tick Beat out life's usual time, and slowly rung The long, loud hours, that exclaimed, âBe quick!â Arise!âGo forth!âHear how her black wrongs call!â Make them the salve to cure thy wounds withal!ââ XI They were my balsam: for, ere autumn came, Weak still, but over eager to be gone, I took my leave of him. A little lame From that hip wound, and somewhat thin and wan, I sought the village. Here I heard her name And shame's made one. How Rupert passed one dawn; How she among his troopers rodeâastride Like any manâpale-faced and feverish-eyed. XII Which way these took they pointed, and I went Like fire after. Oh, the thought was good That they were on before! And much it meant To know she lived still; she, whose image stood Like flame before me, making turbulent Each heart-beat with her wrongs, that were fierce food Unto my hate that, âCourage!â cried, âRest not! Think of her there, and let thy haste be hot!â XIII But months went by and still I had not found: Yet, here and there, as wearily I sought, I caught some news: how he had held his ground Against the Roundhead troops; or how he'd fought Then fledâreturned and conquered. Like a hound Questing a boar, I followed; but was brought No nearer to my quarry. Day by day It seemed that Satan kept him from my way. XIV A woman rode beside him, so they said, A fair-faced wanton, mounted like a manâ Isolda!âmy Isolda!âBetter dead, Yea, dead and damned! than thusâthe courtezan Bold, unreluctant, to such men! A dread, That such should be, unmanned me. Doubt began To whisper at my heart.âBut I was mad, To insult her with such thoughts, whose love I had. XV At last one day I rested in a glade Near that same woodland which I lay in when Sore wounded: and, while sitting in the shade Of an old beechâwhat! did I dream? or men Like Rupert's own ride near me? and a maidâ Isolda or her double!âWildly then I rose and, shouting, leapt upon my horse; Unsheathed my sword and rode across their course. XVI Mainly I looked for Rupert, and by name Challenged him forth:ââDog! dost thou hide behind?â Insulter of women! Coward! save where shame And rapine call thee! God at last is kind, And my sword waits!ââLike an upbeating flame, My voice rose to a windy shout; and blind I seemed to sit, till, with an outstretched hand, Isolda rode before me from that band. XVII âGerald!â she cried; not as a soul surprised With gladness that the loved, deemed dead, still lives; But like the soul that long hath realized Only misfortune and to fortune gives No confidence, though it be recognized As good. She spoke: âLo, we are fugitives. Rupert is slain. And I am going home.â Then like a child asked simply, âWilt thou come? . . . XVIII âOh, I have suffered, Gerald! Oh, my God! What shame! What torture! Once my soul was cleanâ Stained and defiled behold it!âI have trod Sad ways of hell and horror. I have seen And lived all depths of lust. Yet, oh, my God! Blameless I hold myself of what hath been, Though through it all, yea,âthis thou too must know,â I loved him, my betrayer and thy foe!â XIX Sobbing she spoke as if but half awake, Her eyes far-fixed beyond me, far beyond All hope of mine.âSo! it was for his sake, His love, that she had suffered! . . . Blind and fond, For what return! . . . And Iâto nurse a snake, And never dream its nature would respond With some such fang of venom! 'Twas for this That I had ventured allâto find her his! XX At first half-stunned I stood; then blood and brain, Like two stern judges, who had slept, awoke, Rose up and thundered, âSlay her!â Every vein And nerve responded, âSlay her at a stroke!ââ And I had done it, but my heart again, Like a strong captain in a tumult, spoke, And the fierce discord fell. And quietly I sheathed my sword and said, âI'll go with thee.â XXI But this was my reward for all I'd borne, My loyalty and love! To see her eyes Hollow from tears for him; her thin cheeks worn With grief for him; to know them all for lies, Her vows of faith to me; to come forlorn, Where I had hoped to come on Paradise, On Hell's black gulf; and, as if not enough, Soiled as she was and outcast, still to love! XXII Then rode one ruffian from the rest, clay-flecked From spur to plume with hurry; seized my rein, AndââWhat art thou,â demanded, âwho hast checked Our way and challenged?ââThen, with some disdain, Isolda, âSir, my kinsman did expect Your captain here. What honor may remain To me I pledge for him. Hold off thy hands! He but attends me to the Moated Manse.â XXIII We rode in silence. And at evening came Unto the Moated Manse.âGreat clouds had grown Up in the west, on which the sunset's flame Lay like the hand of slaughter.âVery lone Its rooms and halls: a splintered door that, lame, Swung on one hinge; a cabinet o'erthrown; Or arras torn; or blood-stain turning wan, Showed us the way the battle once had gone. XXIV We reached the tower-chamber towards the west, In which on that dark day she thought to hide From Rupert when, at last, 'twas manifest We could not hold the Manse. There was no pride In her deep eyes now; nor did scorn invest Her with such dignity as once defied Him bursting in to find her standing here Prepared to die like some dog-hunted deer. XXV She took my hand, and, as if naught of love Had ever been between us, said,ââAll know The madness of that hour when with his glove He struck, then slew my brother, and brought woe On all our house: and thou, incensed above The rest, came here, and made my foe thy foe. But he had left. 'Twas then I promised thee My hand, but, ah! my heart was gone from me. XXVI âYea, he had won me, this same Rupert, when He was our guest.âThou know'st how gallantry And recklessness make heroes of most men To us weak women!âAnd so secretly I vowed to be his wife. It happened then My brother found him in some villainy; The insult followed: Guy was killed . . . and thou Dost still remember how I made a vow.â XXVII âBut still this man pursued me, and I held Firm to my vow, albeit I loved him still, Unknown to all, with all the love unquelled Of first impressions, and against my will. At last despair of winning me compelled Him to the oath he swore: He would not kill, But take me living and would make my life A living death. No man should make me wife. XXVIII âThe war, that now consumes us, did, indeed, Give him occasion.âI had not been warned, When down he came against me in the lead Of his marauders. With thy help I scorned His mad attacks two days. I would not plead Nor parley with him, who came hoofed and horned, Like Satan's self in soul, and, with Hell's aid, Took this strong house and kept the oath he made. XXIX âMonths passed. Alas! it needs not here to tell What often thou hast heard: Of how he led His ruffians here now there; or what befell Me of dishonor. Oft I wished me dead, Loathing my life,âthan which the nether Hell Hath less of horror!âSo we fought or fled From place to place until a year had passed, And Parliament forces hemmed us in at last. XXX âYea, I had only lived for thisâto right With death my wrongs sometime. And love and hate Contended in my bosom when, that night Before the fight that should decide our fate, I entered where he slept. There was no light Save of the stars to see by. Long and late I leaned above him there, yet could not killâ Hate raised the dagger but love held it still. XXXI âThe woman in me conquered. What a slave To our emotions are we! To relent At this long-waited moment!âWave on wave Of pitying weakness swept me, and I bentâ And kissed his face. Then prayed to God; and gave My trust to God; and left to God th' event.â I never looked on Rupert's face again, For in the morning's combatâhe was slain. XXXII âOut of defeat escaped some scant three score Of all his followers. And night and day We fled; and while the Roundheads pressed us sore, And in our road, good as a fortress, lay The Moated Manse,âwhere our three-score or more Might well hold out,âI pointed them the way. And we are come, amid its wrecks to end The crime begun here.âThou must go, my friend! XXXIII âGo quickly! For the time approaches when Destruction must arrive.âOh, well I know All thou wouldst say to me.âWhat boots it then?â I tell thee thou must go! that thou must go!â Yea, dost thou think I'd have thee die 'mid men Like these, for such an one as I?âNo! no!â Thy life is clean. Thou shalt not cast away Thy clean life for my soiled one!â . . . âI will stay!â XXXIV I said.âThen spoke . . . . I know not what it was. And seized her hand and kissed it and then said,â âThou art my promised wife. Thou hast no cause That is not mine. I love thee. We will wed. Isolda, come!ââA moment did she pause, Then shook her head and sighed, âMy heart is dead. This can not be. Behold, that way is thine. I will not let thee share the way that's mine.â XXXV Then turning from me ere I could prevent Passed like a shadow from the shadowy room, Leaving my soul in shadow. . . . Naught was meant By my sweet flower of love then! bloom by bloom I'd watched it wither; then its fragrance went, And dust it was now. . . . It was dark as doom, And bells seemed ringing far off in the rain, When from that house I turned my face again. XXXVI Then in the night a trumpet; and the dull Close thud of horse and clash of spurs and arms; And glimmering helms swept by me.âSorrowful I stood and waited till against the storm's Black breast, the Manse,âa burning carbuncle,â Blazed like a battle-beacon, and alarms Of onslaught clanged around it.âThen, like one, Who bears with him God's curse, I galloped on. AN OLD TALE RETOLD From the terrace here, where the hills indent, You can see the uttermost battlement Of the castle there: the Clifford's home Where the seasons go and the seasons come And never a footstep else doth fall Save the prowling fox's; the ancient hall Echoes no voice save the owlet's call: Its turret chambers are homes for the bat; And its courts are tangled and wild to see; And where in the cellar was once the rat, The viper and toad move stealthily. Long years have passed since the place was burned, And he sailed to the wars in France and earned The name that he bears of the bold and true On his tomb.âLong years, since my lord, Sir Hugh, Lived, and I was his favorite page, And the thing then happened; and he of an age When a man will love and be loved again, Or off to the wars or a monastery; Or toil till he deaden his heart's hard pain; Or drink and forget it and finally bury. I was his page. And often we fared Through the Clare demesne, in autumn, hawkingâ If the Baron had known, how they would have glared, 'Neath their bushy brows, those eyes of mocking!â That last of the Strongbows, Richard, I meanâ And growling some six of his henchmen lean To mount and after this Clifford and hang With his crop-eared page to the nearest oak, How he would have cursed us while he spoke! For Clare and Clifford had ever a fang In the other's side . . . And I hear the clang Of his rage in the hall when the hawker toldâ If he told!âhow we met on the autumn wold His daughter, sweet Clara of Clare, the day Her hooded tiercel its brails did burst, And trailing its jesses, came flying our wayâ An untrained haggard the falconer cursed While he tried to secure:âas the eyas flew Slant, low and heavily over us, Hugh,â Who saw it coming, and had just then cast His peregrine hawk at a heron quarry,â In his saddle rising thus, as it passed By the jesses caught, and to her did carry, Where she stood near the wood. Her face flushed rose With the glad of the meeting.âNo two foes Her eyes and my lord's, I swear, who saw 'Twas love from the start.âAnd I heard him speak; Dismount, then kneelâand the sombre shaw, With the sad of the autumn waste and bleak, Grew spring with her smile, as the hawk she took On her slender wrist, where it pruned and shook Its callowness. Then I saw him seize The hand that she reached to him, long and white, As she smilingly bade him rise from his kneesâ When he kissed her fingers her eyes grew bright. But her cheeks were pallid when, lashing through The thicket there, his face a-flare With the sting of the wind, and his gipsy hair Flying, the falconer came, and two Or three of the people of Castle Clare. And the leaves of the autumn made a frame For the picture there in the morning's flame. What was said in that moment I do not know, That moment of meeting between those lovers: Whatever it was, 't was whispered low, Soft as a leaf that swings and hovers, A twinkling gold, when the woods are yellow. And her face with the joy was still aglow When out of the wood that burly fellow Came with his frown, and made a pause In the pulse of their words.âMy lord, Sir Hugh, Stood with the soil on his knee. No cause Had he, but his hanger he partly drew, Then clapped it sharp in its sheath again, And bowed to my lady, and strode away; And vaulting his horse, with a loosened rein Rode with a song in his heart all day. He loved and was loved, I knew; for, look! All other sports for the chase he forsook. And strange that he never went to hawk, Or hunt, but Clara would meet him there In the Strongbow forest!âI know the rock, With its ferns and its moss, by the bramble lair, Where oft and often he metâby chance, Shall I say?âthe daughter of Clare; as fair Of face as a queen in an old romance, Who waits expectant and pale; her hair Night-deep; and eyes dove-gray with dreams;â By the fountain-side where the statue gleams And the moonbeam lolls in the lily white,â For her knightly lover who comes at night. Heigh-ho! they ceased, those meetings. I wot, Betrayed to the Baron by some of his crew Of menials who followed and saw and knew. For she loved too well to have once forgot The time and the place of their trysting true. âWhy and when?â would ask Sir Hugh In the labored letters he used to lock âThe lovers' postâin a coigne of that rock. She used to answer, but now did not. But, nearing Yule, love gat them again A twilight trystâthrough frowardness sure!â They met. And the day was gray with rain, And snow: and the wind did ever endure A long bleak moaning through the wood, That chapped i' the cheek and smarted the blood; And a burne in the forest went throb and throb, And over it all was the wild-beast sob Of the rushing boughs like a thing pursued. And then it was that he learned how she, (God's blood! how it makes my old limbs quiver To think what a miserable tyrant heâ The Baron Richardâaye and ever To his daughter was!) forsooth! must wed With an eastern earlâa Lovell: to whom (Would God o' His mercy had struck him dead!) Clara of Clare when merely a child,â With a face like a flower, that blows in the wild Of the hills, and a soul like its soft perfume,â Was givenâsay, sealedâto strengthen some ties Of power and wealthâsay bartered, then, Like the veriest chattel. With tearful eyes And lips a-tremble she spoke. And when My lord, her lover, had learned and heard,â He'd have had her flee with him then, 'sdeath! In spite of them all! Let her say the word, They would fly together: the baron's men Might follow; and if . . . and he touched his swordâ It should answer! But she, while she seemed to stay, With a hand on her bosom, her heart's quick breath, Replied to his heat: âThey would take and slay Thee who art life of my life!âNot thus Will we fly!âThere's another way for us; A way that is sure; an only way; I have thought on it this many a day.ââ The words that she spake how well I remember! As well as the mood o' that day of December, That bullied and blustered and seemed in league, Like a spiteful shrew, with the wind and the snow, To drown the words of their sweet intrigue, With the boom of the boughs tossed to and fro, That the storm swept through with its wildbeast low. Her last words these, âBy curfew sure, On Christmas eve, at the postern door.â And we were there; with a led horse too; Armed for a journeyâI hardly knew Whither, but why, you well may guess. For often he whispered a certain name, The talisman dear of his happiness, That warmed his blood like a Yule-log's flame. While we waited there, till its owner came, We saw how the castle's baronial girth, Like a giant's, loosed for revelling more, Shone; and we heard the wassail and mirth Where the mistletoe hung in the hearth's red roar, And the holly brightened the weaponed wall Of carven oak in the banqueting hall. And the spits, I trow, by the scullions turned O'er the snoring logs, rich steamed and burned, Where the whole wild-boar and the deer were roasted, And the half of an ox and the roe-buck's haunches; While tuns of ale, that the cellars boasted, And casks of sack, were broached for paunches Of vassals who revelled in stable and hall. The song of the minstrel; the yeomen's quarrel O'er the dice and the drink; and the huntsman's bawl In the baying kennels, its hounds a-snarl O'er the bones of the feast; now loud, now low, We could hear where we crouched in the drifting snow. Was she long? did she come? . . . By the postern we Like shadows waited. My lord, Sir Hugh, Spoke, pointing a tower: âThat casement, see? When a stealthy light in its slit burns blue And signals thrice slowly, thusâ't is she.â And close to his breast his gaberdine drew, For the wind it whipped and the snow beat through. Did she come?âWe had waited an hour or twain, When the taper flashed in the central pane, And flourished three times and vanished so. And under the arch of the postern's portal, Crouched down by the horses we stood in the snow, Stiff with the cold.âAh, me! immortal Minutes we waited, breath-bated, and listened Shivering there in the hurl of the gale: The parapets whistled, the angles glistened, And the night around seemed one black wail Of death, whose ominous presence over The snow-swept battlements seemed to hover. Said my lord, Sir Hugh,âto himself he spoke,â âShe feels for the spring in the sliding panel 'Neath the arras, hid in the carven oak. It opens. The stair, like a well's dark channel, Yawns, and the draught makes her taper slope. Wrapped deep in her mantle of fur, she puts One foot on the stair: now a listening pause As nearer and nearer the mad search draws Of the thwarted castle. No smallest hope That they find her now that the panel shuts! If the wind, that howls like a tortured thing, Would throttle itself with its cries, then I Might hear how her hurrying footsteps ring Down the secret . . . there! 'tis her fingers try The postern's bolts that the rust makes cling.ââ But 'twas only some whim of the wind that shook A clanging ring on a creaking hook In the buttress or wall. And we waited, numb With the cold, till dawnâbut she did not come. I must tell you why and have done: 'Tis said, On the eve of the marriage she fled the side Of the guests and the bridegroom there: she fled With a mischievous laugh,ââI'll hide! I'll hide! A kiss for the one who shall find!ââand led A long search after her; but defied All search forâa score and ten long years. Well, the laughter of Yule was turned to tears For them as for us. We saw the glare Of torches that hurried from chamber to stair; And we heard the castle reÃ«cho her name, But she laughed no answer and never came, And that was the last of Clara of Clare. That winter it was, a month thereafter, That the home of the Cliffords, roof and rafter, Burned.âI could swear 'twas the Strongbow's doing, Were I sure that he knew of the Clifford's wooing His daughter; and so, by the Rood and Cross! Made a torch of Hugh's home to avenge his loss.â So over the Channel to France with his King, The Black Prince, sailed to the warsâto deaden The ache of the mysteryâHugh that spring And fell at Poitiers; for his loss lay leaden O' his heart; and his life was a weary sadness, So he flung it away in a moment's madness. And the baron died. And the bridegroom?âwell, Unlucky was he in truth!âto tell Of him there is nothing.âThe baron died, The last of the Strongbows heâgramercy! And the Clare estate with its wealth and pride Devolved to the Bloets, Walter and Percy. And years went by. And it happened that they Ransacked the old castle; and so, one day, In a lonesome tower uprummaged a chest, From Flanders; of ebon, and wildly carved All over with masks: a sinister crest 'Mid gargoyle faces distorted and starved: Fast-fixed with a spring, which they forced and, lo! When they opened itâDeath, like a lady dressed, Grinned up at their terror!âbut no, not so! Fantastic a skeleton, jeweled and wreathed With flowers of dust; and a miniver Around it clasped, that the ruin sheathed Of a once rich raiment of silk and of fur. I'd have given my life to hear him tell, The courtly Clifford, how this befell! He'd have known how it was: For, you see, in groping For the secret spring of that panel, hoping And fearing as nearer and nearer drew The search of retainers, why, out she blew The tell-tale taper; and seeing this chest, Would hide her a minute in it, mayhap, Till the hurry had passed; but the death-lock, pressed By the lid's great weight, shut down with a snap, And her life went out in the hellish trap. MY LADY OF VERNE It all comes back as the end draws near; All comes back like a tale of old! Shall I tell you what? Will you lend an ear? You, with your face so stern and cold; You, who have found me dying here. . . . Lady Valora's villa at Verneâ You have walked its terraces, where the fount And statue gleam and the fluted urn; Its world-old elms, that are avenues gaunt Of shadow and flame when the west is a-burn. 'Tis a lonely region of tarns and trees, And hollow hills that circle the west; Haunted of rooks and the far-off sea's Immemorial vague unrest; A land of sorrowful memories. A gray sad land, where the wind has its will, And the sun its way with the fruits and flowers; Where ever the one all night is shrill, And ever the other all day brings hours Of glimmering hush that dead dreams fill. A gray sad land, where her girlhood grew To womanhood proud, that the hill-winds seemed To give their moods, like melody, to; And the stars, their thoughts, like dreams love dreamedâ The only glad thing that the sad land knew. My Lady, you know, how nobly born! Greatly born, with a head that rose Like a dream of empire; love and scorn Made haunts of her eyes; and her lipsâtwin bows Of bloom, where wit was a pleasant thorn. And Iâoh, I was nobody: one Her worshiper merely; who chose to be Silent, seeing that love alone Was his only badge of nobility, Set in his heart's escutcheon. How long ago does the springtime look, When we wandered away to the hills! the hills,â Like the land in the tale in the Fairy-book,â Gold with the gold of the daffodils, And gemmed with the crocus by bank and brook! When I gathered a branch from a hawthorn tree, For her hair or bosom, from boughs that hung Odorous of Heaven and purity; She thanked me smiling; then merrily sung This song while she laughingly looked at me:â âThere dwelt a princess over the seaâ Oh fair was she, right fair was sheâ Who loved a squire of low degree, Of low degree, But wedded a king of Brittanyâ Ah, woe is me! is me! âAnd it came to pass on the wedding dayâ So people say, I have heard sayâ That they found her dead in her bridal array, Her bridal array, And dead her lover beside her layâ Ah, well-away! away! âA sour stave for your sweets,â she said, Pressing the blossoms against her lips: Then petal by petal the branch she shred, Snowing the blooms from her finger-tips, Tossing them down for her feet to tread. What to her was the look I gave Of love despised!âThough she seemed to start, Seeing; and said, with a quick hand-wave, âWhy, one would think that that was your heart,â While her face with a sudden thought grew grave. But I answered nothing. And so to her home We came in the eve; slow-falling, clear With a few first stars and a crescent of foam, The twilight dusked; and we heard from the mere The distant boom of a bittern come. Would you think that she loved me?âWho could say?â What a riddle unread was she to me!â When I kissed her fingers and turned away I wanted to speak, butâwhat cared she, Though her eyes looked soft and she bade me stay! Though she lingered to watch meâThat might be A slim moonbeam or a shred of haze,â But never my Lady's drapery Or wistful face!âin the woodbine maze. Valora of Verneâwhy, what cared she! So the days went by, and the Summer wore Its hot heart out; and, a mighty slayer, The Autumn harried the land and shore, And the world grew red with its wrecks; then grayer Than ghosts of the dreams of the nevermore. The sheaves of the Summer had long been bound; The harvests of Autumn had long been past; And the snows of the Winter lay deep around, When the hard news came and I knew at last; And the reigning woe of my heart was crowned. So I sought her here: the old Earl's bride: In the ancient room, at the oriel dreaming, Pale as the blooms in her hair; and, wide, The dented satin, flung stormily, gleaming Like beaten silver, twilight-dyed. I marked as I stole to her side that tears Were vaguely large in her beautiful eyes; That the loops of pearls on her throat, and years- Old lace on her bosom were heaved with sighs: And I said to her softly:ââIt appearsââ Then stopped with, it seemed, my soul in my eyesâ âThat you are not happy, Valora of Verne! There is that at your heart whichâwell, denies These mocking mummeries.âLive and learn!â And is it the truth or only lies?â âYou must hear me now! whom I oft with my heart,â In words of the soul, that are silent in speech,â Whispered my love; too sacred for art; But yours never heardâfor I could not reach Yours in that world of which you are part. âThat world, where I saw you as one afar Sees palms and waters, and knows that sands, Pitiless sands, before him are; Yet follows ever with reaching hands Till he sinks at last.âYou were my star, âMy hope, my heaven!âI loved you! . . . Life Is less than nothing to me!â . . . She turned, With a wild look, sayingââNow I am his wife You come and tell me!âIndeed you are learned In the unheard language of hearts!â . . . A knife, As she ceased and leaned on a cabinet,â A curve of scintillant steel keen, cold,â Fell, icily clashing: a curio met Among Asian antiques, bronze and gold, Mystical; curiously graven and set. A Bactrian dagger, whose slightest prick, Through its ancient poison, was death, I knew.â If true that she loved meâthen!âAnd quick To the unspoken thought she replied, â'Tis true! I have loved you long, and my soul was sick, âSick for the love that has made me weak, Weak to your will even now!ââAnd more She said, in my arms, that I will not speakâ And the dagger there on the polished floor Ever her eyes, while she spoke, would seek. ââAnd it came to pass on the wedding-dayâââ Then my lips for a moment were crushed to hersâ ââThat they found her dead in her bridal array,ââ She sang; then said, âYou finish the verse! Finish the song, for you know the way.â And I whispered âyes,â for my heart had thought Her own thought throughâthat life were a hell To us so asunder.âAnd the blade I caught With a sudden hand; and she leaned; andâwell, What a little wound, and the blood it brought To crimson her bosom!âI set her there In that carven chair; then turned the blade,â With its white-gold handle thick with the glare, Barbaric, of jewels, wildly inlaid,â To my breast, for the poisonous point rent bare. A stain of blood on her breast, and one Black red o'er my heart, you see.â'Tis good To die with her here! . . . Does the sinking sun, Through the dull deep west burst, banked with blood?â Or is it that life will at last have done? . . . So you are her husband? andâwell, you see, You see she is dead . . . and her faceâhow white! Fate bungled the cards!âdid this have to be?â What matters it now!âFor at last the night Falls and the darkness covers me. GERALDINE Ah, Geraldine, my Geraldine, That night of love when last we met, You have forgotten, Geraldineâ I never dreamed you would forget. Ah, Geraldine, my Geraldine, More lovely than that Asian queen, Scheherazade, the beautiful, Who in her orient palace cool Of India, for a thousand nights And one, beside her monarch lay, Tellingâwhile sandal-scented lights And music stole the soul awayâ Love tales of old Arabia, Full of enchantments and empriseâ But no enchantments like your eyes. Ah, Geraldine, loved Geraldine, Less lovely were those maids, I ween, Pampinea and Lauretta, who, In gardens old of dusk and dew, Sat with their lovers, maid and man, In stately days Italian, And in quaint stories, that we know Through grace of good Boccaccio, Told of fond loves,âsome false, some true,â But, Geraldine, none false as you. Ah, Geraldine, lost Geraldine, That night of love, when last we met, You have forgotten, Geraldineâ I never dreamed you would forget. 'Twas summer; and the moon swam high, A great pale pearl within the sky: And down that purple night of love The stars, concurrent spark on spark, Seemed moths of flame that swarmed above: And through the roses, o'er the park, Star-like the fireflies sowed the dark: A mocking-bird in some deep tree, Drowsy with dreams and melody,â Like a magnolia bud, that, dim, Opens and pours its soul in musk,â Gave to the moonlight and the dusk Its heart's pure song, its evening hymn. Oh, night of love! when in the dance Your heart thrilled rapture into mine, As, in a state of necromance, A mortal hears a voice divine. Oh, night of love! when from your glance I drank sweet death as men drink wine. You wearied of the waltz at last. I led you out into the night. Warm in my hand I held yours fast. Your face was flushed; your eyes were bright. The moon hung like a shell of light Above the lake, the tangled trees; And borne to us with fragrances Of roses that were ripe to fall, The soul of music from the hall Beat in the moonlight and the breeze, As youth's wild heart grown weary of Desire and its dream of love. I held your arm and, for a while, We walked along the balmy aisle Of blossoms that, like velvet, dips Unto the lake which lilies tile With stars; and hyacinths, with strips Of heaven. And beside a fall, That down a ferned and mossy wall Fell in a lake,âdeep, woodbine-wound,â A latticed summer-house we found; A green kiosk; through which the sound Of waters and of zephyrs swayed, And honeysuckle bugles played Soft serenades of perfume sweet,â Around which ran a rustic seat. And seated in that haunted nook,â I know not how it was,âa word, A touch, perhaps, a sigh, a look, Was father to the kiss I took; Great things grow out of small I've heard. And then it was I took between My hands your face, loved Geraldine, And gazed into your eyes, and told The story ever new though old. You did not look away, but met My eyes with eyes whose lids were wet With tears of truth; and you did lean Your cheek to mine, my Geraldine.â I never dreamed you would forget. The night-wind and the water sighed: And through the leaves, that stirred above, The moonbeams swooned with music of The danceâsoft things in league with love: I never dreamed that you had lied. How all comes back now, Geraldine! The melody; the glimmering scene; Your angel face; and ev'n,âbetween Your lawny breasts,âthe heart-shaped jewel,â To which your breath gave fluctuant fuel,â A rosy star of stormy fire; The snowy drift of your attire, Lace-deep and fragrant: and your hair, Disordered in the dance, held back By one gemmed pin,âa moonbeam there, Half-drowned within its night-like black.â And I who sat beside you then Seemed blessed above all mortal men. I loved you for the way you sighed; The way you said, âI love but you;â The smile with which your lips replied; Your lips, that from my bosom drew The soul; your looks, like undenied Caresses, that seemed naught but true: I loved you for the violet scent That clung about you as a flower; Your moods, where grief and gladness blent, An April-tide of sun and shower; You were my creed, my testament, Wherein I met with God's high power. Was it because the loving see Only what they desire shall be There in the well-belovÃ©d's soul, Passion and heart's affinity, That I beheld in you the whole Of my love's image? and believed You loved as I loved? nor perceived Yours was a mask, a mockery! Ah, Geraldine, lost Geraldine, That night of love, when last we met, You have forgotten, Geraldineâ I never dreamed you would forget. AT THE CORREGIDOR'S The young advocate Don Sebastian Lopez, between three pinches of snuff, lays the facts of the case before his friend, Don Emanuel de Cordova, chief magistrate of the City of Valladolid. To Don Odora said Donna De Vine, âI yield to thy long endeavor!â At my balcony be on the stroke of nine, And, SeÃ±or, I'm thine forever!â . . . This beauty at first had the Don descried As she quit the confessional: followed: âWhat a face! what a form! what a foot!â he sighed, And more that he, smiling, swallowed. And with vows as soft as his oaths were sweet Her heart he barricaded; And pressed this point with a present meet, And that point serenaded. What else could the enemy do but yield To such handsome importuning? A gallant blade with a lute for shield All night at her lattice mooning! âQue es estrella! thou star of all girls! Here's that for thy fierce duenna: A purse of pistoles and a rosary o' pearls, And gold as yellow as henna. âShe will drop from thy balcony's rail, my sweet, My seraph! this silken ladder: And thenâsweet then!âmy soul at thy feet, What angel in Heaven gladder!â And the end of it wasâBut I will not say How he won to the room of the lady.â Ah! to love is to live! and with youthâwhy, hey! For the rest,âa maravedi! Now comes her betrothed from the wars; and he, A Count of the Court Castilian, A Don Diabolus! sword at knee, And face and hairâvermilion. And his is a jealous love; andâfor The story grows sadder and sadderâ He watches, and seesâa robber? to her, Or gallant? ascend a ladder. So he pushes inquiry into her room; With his naked sword demanding: An alguazil, with a face like doom, Sure of a stout withstanding. And weapon to weapon they foined and fought: The Count's first thrusts were vicious: Three thrusts to the floor Odora had brought: And one through the white, capricious. The naked bosom of Donna De Vineâ And this is the Count's condition. . . . Was he right? was he wrong?âthe question is mine;â To judgeâfor the Inquisition. AN EPISODE A woman speaks. Year 1218; war of the Albigenses. I Saint Dominick, Pope Innocent, Thou holy host Lyons once bent On Languedoc, may God the Father Plunge you in everlasting Hell! And may the blood of those who fell At BÃ©ziers together gather In torrents of eternal pain, And on your souls beat boiling rain! II And Mountfort!âit was given me, (For I had prayed incessantly), To be the David to this giant.â An Albigensian warrior My husband was. He, in the war, The Pope had thundered on defiant Thoulouse and outlawed Languedoc, Stood with Earl Raymond like a rock. III The walls of BÃ©ziers cried loud, And Carcassonne's, red in their cloud Of blood, disease, and conflagration, For vengeance!âWhen he left me here, With my two babes, I felt no fear. The crusade's excommunication Poured down its holy Catholics To crush and burn us heretics. IV At Carcassonne he fell. And there My babes died famished. And despair And hell were mine within their prison, Till Mother of our God portrayed This Mountfort's death. On me were laid Blessed hands of power in a vision. A call, my soul could not refuse, Compelled me to besieged Thoulouse. V No arrow mine, no arbalist; A sling, a stone, a woman's wrist God and His virgin Mother aided.â Their engines rocked our walls. I felt The time had come and, praying, knelt; Then, from the sling my hair had braided, Launched at De Mountfort's bassinet The rock where eyebrow eyebrow met. VI Thus Mountfort died. Of Carcassonne Our Lady 'twas who aimed the stone, That slew this monster that was master:â For Iâ I was the instrument, Saint Dominick and Innocent, That hurled on you and yours disaster! Two armies saw me whirl the sling While Heaven stood by meâwhite of wing. THE SLAVE He waited till within her tower Her taper signalled him the hour. He was a prince both fair and brave. What hope that he would love her slave! He of the Persian dynasty; And she a Queen of Araby!â No Peri singing to a star Upon the sea were lovelier. I helped her drop the silken rope. He clomb, aflame with love and hope. I drew the dagger from my gown And cut the ladder, leaning down. Oh, wild his face, and wild the fall: Her face was wilder than them all. I heard her cry, I heard him groan, And stood as merciless as stone. The eunuchs came: fierce scimitars Stirred in the torch-lit corridors. She spoke like one who prays in sleep, And bade me strike or she would leap. I bade her leap; the time was short; And kept the dagger for my heart. She leapt. I put their blades aside And smiling in their facesâdied. THE ROSICRUCIAN I The tripod flared with a purple spark, And the mist hung emerald in the dark: Now he stooped to the lilac flame Over the glare of the amber embers, Thrice to utter no earthly name; Thrice, like a mind that half remembers; Bathing his face in the magic mist Where the brilliance burned like an amethyst. II âSylph, whose soul was born of mine, Born of the love that made me thine, Once more flash on the flesh! Again Be the loved caresses taken! Lip to lip let our mouths remain!â Here in the circle of sense, awaken! Ere spirit meets spirit, the flesh laid by, Let me know thee, and let me die!â III Sunset heavens may burn, but never Know such splendor! There bloomed an ever Opaline orb, where the sylphid rose A shape of luminous white; diviner White than the essence of light that sows The moons and suns through space; and finer Than radiance born of a shooting-star, Or the wild Aurora that streams afar. IV âLook on the face of the soul to whom Thou givest thy soul like added perfume! Thou, who heard'st me, who long had prayed, Waiting alone at evening's portal!â Thus on thy lips let my lips be laid, Love, who hast made me all immortal! Give me thine arms now! Come and rest Happiness out on my beaming breast!â V Was it her soul? or the sapphire fire That sang like the note of a Seraph's lyre? Out of her mouth there came no wordâ She spake with her soul, as a flower speaketh Fragrant messages none hath heard, Which the sense divines when the spirit seeketh. . . . And he seemed alone in a place so dim That the spirit's face, who was gazing at him, For its burning eyes he could not see: Then he knew he had died; that she and he Were one; and he saw that this was she. THE NORMAN KNIGHT Within the castle chamber The Norman knight lay dead; The quarterings of the casement Shone holy round his head. And first there came a maiden; Her face was wet and white: She kissed his mouth and murmured, âThou wast my own true knight.â Within the arrased chamber The Norman knight lay dead; And tapers four and twenty Burnt at his feet and head. And next there came a friar And prayed beside the bier: âThou art a blessÃ©d angel, Who wast so noble here.â Within the lofty chamber The Norman knight lay dead; Dim through the carven casement The moonbeams lit his head. And then there came a varletâ Loud laughed he in his face: âThus do I spit upon thee, Thee and thy cursÃ©d race!â Within the silent chamber The Norman knight lay deadâ Nor Norman knight nor Saxon serf Heard aught the dead man said. THE KHALIF AND THE ARAB Among the tales, wherein it hath been told, In golden letters in a book of gold, Of Hatim Tai's hospitality, Who, substanceless and dead and shadowy, Made men his guests upon a mountain top Whereon his tomb grayed from a thistle crop;â A tomb of rock where women, hewn of stone, Rude figures, spread dishevelled hair, whose moan From dark to daybreak made the silence sigh, At which the camel-drivers, tented nigh, âGhouls or hyenasâ shuddering would say, But only granite women find at day:â Among such talesâwho questions of their truth?â One tale still haunts me from my earliest youth; Of that lost city, Sheddad son of Aad Built 'mid the Sebaa sands,âa king who had Dominion over many lands and kings,â That city, built in pride and pow'r, of things Unstable of the earth. For he had read Of Paradise and to himself had said, âNow in this life the like of Paradise I'll build me and the Prophet's may despise, Having no need of that he promises.â So for this city taxed the lands and seas, And columned Irem, on a blinding height, Blazed in the desert like a chrysolite; The manner of its building, it is told, Alternate bricks of silver and of gold. But Sheddad with his women and his slaves, His thousand viziers, armored troops, as waves Of ocean countless, God with awful flameâ Shot sheer in thunder on himâovercame, Confounded, and abolished; (ere his eyes Had glimpsed bright follies of that paradise) And blotted to a wilderness the land Wherein accursed it lies and lost in sand.â Sad tales and glad; and 'mid them one, in sooth, That is recorded of an Arab youth. The Khalif Hisham ben Abdulmelik, Hunting one day, through some unusual freak Rode, parted from his retinue, and gave Chase to an antelope. Without a slave, Vizier or amir to a pasture place Of sheep he came, where dark, in tattered grace, Watched one, an Arab youth. And as it came The antelope drew off, with words of flame, On fire with rage, unto the youth he turned, Shouting, âThou slave! ho, hast thou not discerned The antelope escapes me? Up, dog, run! Head him back this way!â Rising in the sun, The Arab flamed, âO ignorant of worth! Unworthy of respect!âthough high thy birth,â In that thou look'st upon me,âvile of heart!â As one fit for contempt, thou lack'st no part Of my disdain!âAllah! I would not own A dog of thine for friend, no other known! Poor though I be, thou tyrant mixed with ass!â And flung him, rags and rage, into the grass. Incensed, astonished, frowning furiously, Said Hisham, âSlave! thou know'st me not, I see!â Calmly the youth, âAye, verily I know!â O mannerless! who would command me so, Except thyself, ere he said âPeace to theeâ? Well art thou known, aye! all too well of me!â âO dog! I am thy Khalif! by a hair Thy life hangs raveling.â âThough it dangle there And rot to nothing, still upon thy head Would curses shower!âOf thy dwelling place Would Allah be forgetful!âGo thy ways, Hisham ben Merwan, king of many words, Few generosities!â . . . A flash of swords In drifts of dust and, lo! the Khalif's troops Around them rode.âAs when a merlin stoops Some stranger quarry, prey that swims the wind, Heron or eagle; kenning not its kind There, whence 'tis cast, until it, towering, feels An eagle's tearing talons, and still deals Blow upon blow, though hopeless;âso the youth,â An Arab, fearless as the face of Truth, Of all that made him certain of his death,â Waited with eyes indifferent, equal breath. The palace reached, âBring me the prisoner,â Commanded Hisham. And he came as were He in no wise concerned; with eyes intent On some far thing; and on the floor a bent Dark gaze of scornful freedom unafraid, Till at the Khalif's throne his steps were stayed: And, unsaluting, standing head held down, An armed attendant blazed him with a frown, âDog of a Bedouin! may thy eyes rot out! Insulter! art thou blind? and must I shout âThou stand'st before the Sultan! bend thy kneeâ?â To him the Arab, sneering, âVerily, Packsaddle of an ass! it well may be! I kneel to none but God.â The Khalif's rage Exceeded now, and, âBy my realm and age! Arab, thy hour is come, thy very last!â Then said, âCall in the headsman.âFool, thou hast Cast thy young life away. Its thread is past.â The shepherd answered, âAye?âby Allah, then, If through thy means it might be stretched again, Unscissored of what Destiny ordain, Back in thy face I'd fling it as in vain.â Then the chief Chamberlain: âO vilest one Of all the Arabs! wilt thou not be done Bandying thy baseness with the Ruler of The Faithful? thou, with wordy filth enough Within thy madman mouth to fill a jakes! Viler than dirt that one from out it rakes, Here's more for thee!â and spat into his face. And the dark Arab, with that last disgrace All fire, answered: âThou, perhaps, hast heard The Koran text that saysâ'tis God's own word!â âThe day will come when each soul shall be prompt To bow before Me and to give accompt.ââ Then wroth indeed was Hisham: fiercely said, âHe braves us!âHeadsman, ho! his peevish head! See: canst thou medicine its speech anew; Doctor its multiplying words to few: Divorce them well.â So, where the Arab stood, Bound him; made kneel upon the cloth of blood. With curving sword the headsman leaned, at pause, And,âas 'tis custom, made of Moslem laws,â To the descendant of the Prophet quoth, âO Khalif, shall I strike?â âBy Iblis' oath! Strike!â answered Hisham. But again the slave Questioned; and yet again the Khalif gave His nodded âyeaâ; and for the third time then He asked: and knowing neither men nor Jinn Might save him if the Khalif spake assent, Signalled the sword, the youth with body bent Laughedâtill the wang-teeth of each jaw appeared; Laughedâas with scorn the King of kings he'd beard, Deriding Death. So, with redoubled spleen, Roared Hisham, rising, âIt is truly seen This one is mad who mocks at Azrael!â Then said the Arab: âListen!âOnce befell, Commander of the Faithful, that a hawk, A hungry hawk, pounced on a sparrow-cock; And winging nestward with his meal in claw, To him the sparrow,âfor the creature saw The hawk's conceit,âaddressed this slyly, âOh, Most great, most royal, there is not, I know, Aught in me that will stay thy stomach's stress: I am too paltry for thy mightiness!â With which the hawk was pleased, and flattered so That, in a while, he let the sparrow go.â Then smiled the Khalif Hisham: and a sign Staying the scimitar, that hung malign, A threatening crescent, said: âGod bless, preserve The Prophet whom all true believers serve!â Now, by my kinship to the Prophet! and Had he at first but spake us thus this hand Had ne'er been wrathful; and, instead of hate, He had had allâexcept the Khalifate.â Bade stuff his mouth with jewels and entreat Him courteously, then from the palace beat. ARABAH âThe third of these heroes, the blind Arabah.ââ Gibbon. And one brought pearls and one brought passion-flowers To blind Arabah as he lay in dreams, And one brought visions of the after hours. And he beheld the rainbow-rolling streams Of Eden on harmonious sands of gold, And battlements, builded of prismatic beams. He was not sightless now, nor weak, nor old; For lo! the dark-eyed girls of Paradise Rained on him gifts and kisses. And 'tis told How blind Arabah rose with unsealed eyes, With seeing eyes; he who to Allah gave All that he had; which happened in this wise:â âWho's this that lies upon the mosque's cold pave?ââ âA blind man, whom an angel's hand shall lead.ââ âA beggar, richer than the rich who have.ââ âBehold the lesson, such as Sufis feed The soul upon!âO faith, blind-praying, see, Out of thyself how God repays indeed, Ten-thousandfold, one generosity!â . . . All Baghdad knew how, at the hour of prayer, A slave beneath each shoulder, it was he, Old, blind Arabah, whom a suppliant there, Footsore and hungry, met and asked for bread. âAlas! my son, God's poor are everywhere,ââ Hoar as a Koreish priest, Arabah said;â âRicher than thou am I though poor indeed! Take thou my slaves and sell, and buy thee bread.ââ Thrust him his slaves and said, âGreat is thy need. Refuse, and I renounce them!ââAnd the wall Struck with his staff, saying, âThis now shall lead.â âWhile from the mosque rang the muezzin's call, âGod is most mighty! Allah seeth all!â THE SEVEN DEVILS There is a legend, lost in some old dusty Tome of the East,âand who will question it?â Concluding ancient wisdom, rather musty, Wherein much war and wickedness and wit, Insult and wrath and love and shame are writ: Wherein is written that, when Mahomet Fled out of Mecca from the people's wrath, He met a shadow standing in his path, A naked horror, blacker than hewn jet. It in one hand held out a flaming jewel, Wherein fierce colors burnt and blent like eyes Of seven fires, merciless as cruel: The horror said, âGod cursed them for their lies. These are the seven devils of the wise, And I am Satan!â And the prophet saw How he might punish Mecca for its pride; And, gazing on the Fiend, âAllah,â he cried, âLet them be free!â His word, like God's, was law. Since then these seven devils have descended From nation unto nation, past the ken Of Mahomet, who left earth undefended Of any amulet of tongue or pen 'Gainst demons boring at the brains of men: Demons, whose names I dare not breathe or write, For fear of fear, despair and madness, born Of horror, and of frenzy all forlorn, And shadowy evils of the day and night. THAMUS And it is said that Thamus sailed Off islands of Ãgean seas No seaman yet had ever hailed; No vessel touched, no ship of Greece, PhÅnician or the Chersonese. And, lying all becalmed, 'tis told How wonderful with peace that night Rolled out of dusk and dreamy gold One star, whose splendor seemed to light The world with majesty and might. Like shadows on a shadow-ship The dark-haired, dark-eyed sailors lay; When from the island seemed to slip, Borne overhead and far away, A voice that âThamus!â seemed to say. Then silence: and the languid Greek, The lounging Cretan, watched the sky, Or, in carousal, ceased to speak And sing. Again came rolling by The voice, and âThamus!â in its cry. All were awake: tall, swarthy men With bated breath stood listening, Or gravely scanned the shore. And then, Although they saw no living thing, Again they heard the summons ring. And âThamus!â sounded shore and sea: And at the third call leaned the Greek, Full facing toward the isle; and he Cried to the voice and bade it speak The mission, message it would seek. âThou shalt sail on to such a place Among the pagan seas,â it said; âTo such a land: and thou shalt face Against it when the east is red, And cry aloud, âGreat Pan is dead!ââ . . . As fearful of unholy word Their souls stood stricken with strange fear. Then Thamus said, âYea, I have heard. Yet 'tis my purpose still to steer Straight on. That land shall never hear!â And so they sailed that night; and came Into an unknown sea; and there The east burnt like a sword of flame A Cyclops forges: straight the air Fell sick with calm: the morn was fair. Then double dread was theirs; and dread Was Thamus'; and he raised his hand And shouted, âPan! great Pan is dead!â And all the twilight-haunted land Cried, âPan is dead!â from peak to strand. They saw pale shrines and temples nod Among the shaken trees: and pale Wild forms of goddess and of god Crawl forth with crumbling limbs and trail Woe, till the dim land grew one wail.â What tripods groaned?âSerapis first Within Canopus' temples heard The word, and his brute granite burst Its monster bulk. Dodona stirred And bowed its oaks before the word That left them thunder-riv'n; then passed To Aphaca where, marble-hewn, Venus possessed a well that glassed Her form, white-burning, like the moonâ And lo! her loveliness lay strewn. Then o'er Cilicia swept, and bent Sarpedon's oracle with scorn, Apollo.âYea! the gods lay rent And Delphos dumb. And, lo! the morn Flamed o'er the world where Christ lay born. THE MAMELUKE I She was a queen. 'Midst mutes and slaves, A mameluke, he loved her.âWaves Dashed not more hopelessly the paves Of her high marble palace-stair Than lashed his love his heart's despair.â As souls in Hell dream Paradise, He suffered yet forgot it there Beneath Rommanch's houri eyes. II With passion eating at his heart He served her beauty, but dared dart No look at her or word impart.â TaÃ¯fi leather's perfumed tan Beneath her, on a low divan She lay 'mid cushions stuffed with down; A slave-girl with an ostrich fan Sat by her in a golden gown. III She bade him sing; fair lutanist She loved his voice: with one white wrist, Hooped with a blaze of amethyst, She raised her ruby-crusted lute: Gold-welted stuff, like some rich fruit, Her raiment, diamond-showered, rolled Folds pigeon-purple, whence one foot Drooped in an anklet-twist of gold. IV He stood and sang with all the fire That boiled within his blood's desire, That made him all her slave yet higher: And, at the end, his passion durst Quench with one burning kiss its thirst.â O eunuchs! did her face show scorn When through his heart your daggers burst? And dare you say he died forlorn? ROMAUNT OF THE ROSES A jongleur tells to the Viscountess of Ventadour,âwife of the Seigneur of the ChÃ¢teau de Ventadour, in Limousin,âhow the troubadour Bernard, her former lover, met his death. Time, the middle of the 12th century. All the night was drowned in dreaming; And, above the terraced height, Hung the moon, a sinking crescent, In the ocean mirrored white; And a breath of distant music And of fragrance filled the night. Dripped the musk of myriad roses From a million heavy sprays; And the nightingales were sobbing 'Mid the roses, where the haze And the purple mists of midnight Caught the moonlight's rippled rays. And the towers of the palace, 'Mid its belt of ancient trees, On the mountain rose, romantic, White as foam of summer seas; And the murmur of the ocean Made a harp of every breeze. Where the moon shone on the terrace And its fountains' falling foam; Where the marble urns of flowers Spilled their perfume in the gloam; By the alabaster Venus Stood her troubadour come home. Bernard, he who was my master And your lover, Ventadour; There to meet her by commandment, She the lovely Eleanor; She of Normandy the Duchess, He a simple troubadour. And she met him by the statue, By the marble Venus there,â Like a moonbeam 'mid the roses, Who their crimson hearts laid bare, Breathing out their lives in fragrance, At her naked feet and fair.â Then she told him she was Queen now, That her husband now was King, King of England; and to-morrow She would sail. And then a ring From her hand she took and gave him; For the last time bade him sing. And he sang. Below, the dingles, Where the lazy vapors lolled, Where the torrent flashed its cascade, Touched with amethyst and gold, Echoed; where the wild deer glimmered By the ruin gray and old. From the Venus then, or roses, Struck a dagger; snake that stung, Laid him dead who'd tuned her heart's strings Till for him alone they sung: Stilled the heart of him who only From her heart one note had wrung. And the nightingales kept singing 'Mid the roses, while, like stone, Eleanor sank pale beside him, And unto the palace lone Stole a shadow with a dagger, Who shall sit upon a throne. THE PORTRAIT In some quaint NÃ¼rnberg maler-atelier Uprummaged. When and where was never clear Nor yet how he obtained it. When, by whom 'Twas paintedâwho shall say? itself a gloom Resisting inquisition. I opine It is a DÃ¼rer. Mark that touch, this line, Are they deniable?âDistinguished grace And the pure oval of the noble face Tarnished in color badly. Half in light Extend it so. Incline. The exquisite Expression leaps abruptly: piercing scorn; Imperial beauty; each, an icy thorn Of light, disdainful eyes and . . . well! no use! Effaced and but beheld! a sad abuse Of patience.âOften, vaguely visible, The portrait fills each feature, making swell The heart with hope: avoiding face and hair Start out in living hues; astonished, âThere! The woman lives,â your soul exults, when, lo! You hold a blur; an undetermined glow Dislimns a daub.âRestore?âAh, I have tried Our best restorers, but it has defied. Storied, mysterious, say, perhaps, a ghost Lives in the canvas; hers, some artist lost; A duchess', haply. Her he worshiped; dared Not tell he worshiped. From his window stared, Of Nuremberg, one sunny morn when she Passed paged to Court. Her cold nobility Loved, lived for like a purpose. Seized and plied A feverish brushâher face!âDespaired and died. The narrow Judengasse: gables frown Around a humpbacked usurer's, where brown And dirty in a corner long it lay, Heaped in a pile of riff-raff, such asâsay, Retables done in tempora and old Panels by Wohlgemuth; stiff paintings cold Of martyrs and apostles,ânames forgot,â Holbeins and DÃ¼rers, say; a haloed lot Of praying saints, madonnas: these, perchance, 'Mid wine-stained purples, mothed; an old romance; A crucifix and rosary; inlaid Arms, Saracen-elaborate; a strayed NÃ¯ello of Byzantium; rich work, In bronze, of Florence; here a delicate dirk, There holy patens. So. My ancestor, The first De Herancour, esteemed by far This piece most precious, most desirable; Purchased and brought to Paris. It looked well In the dark paneling above the old Hearth of his room. The head's religious gold, The soft severity of the nun face, Made of the room an apostolic place Revered and feared.â Like some lived scene I see That gothic room; its Flemish tapestry: Embossed within the marble hearth a shield, Wreathed round with thistles; in its argent field Three sable malletsâarms of Herancourâ Carved with the crest, a helm and hands that bore, Outstretched, two mallets. On a lectern laid,â Between two casements, lozenge-paned, embayed,â A vellum volume of black-lettered text. Near by a taper, blinking as if vexed With silken gusts a nervous curtain sends, Behind which, haply, daggered Murder bends. And then I seem to see again the hall, The stairway leading to that room.âThen all The terror of that night of blood and crime Passes before me.âIt is Catherine's time: The house, De Herancour's: on floors, splashed red, Torchlight of Medicean wrath is shed: Down carven corridors and rooms,âwhere couch And chairs lie shattered and the shadows crouch, Torch-pierced, with fear,âa sound of swords draws near, The stir of searching steel. What find they here On St. Bartholomew's?âA Huguenot Dead in his chair! Eyes violently shot With horror, fastened on a portrait there; Coiling his neck one blood line, like a hair Of finest fire. The portrait, like a fiend,â Looking exalted visitation,âleaned From its black panel; in its eyes a hate Demonic; hairâa glowing auburn, late A dull, enduring golden. âJust one thread Of the fierce hair around his throat,â they said, âTwisting a burning ray, heâstaring dead.â BEHRAM AND EDDETMA Against each prince now she had held her own, An easy victor for the seven years O'er kings and sons of kingsâEddetma, she, Who, when much sought in marriage, hating men, Espoused their ways to win beyond their strength Through martial exercise and hero deeds: She, who, accomplished in all warlike arts, Had heralds cry through every kingdom knownâ âEddetma weds with none but him who proves Himself her master in the test of arms; Her suitors' foeman she. And he who fails, So overcome of woman, woman-scorned, Disarmed, dishonored, yet shall he depart, Brow-bearing, forehead-stigmatized with fire, The branded words, âEddetma's freedman this!ââ And many princes came to woo with arms, Whom her high maiden prowess put to shame; Pretentious courtiers small in thew and thigh, Proud-palanquined from principalities Of Irak and of Hind and farther Sind. Though she was womanly as that Empress of The proud Amalekites, Tedmureh, and More beautiful, yet she had held her own. To Behram of the Territories, one Son of a Persian monarch swaying kings, Came bruit of her and her great victories, Her maiden beauty and her warrior strength. Eastward he journeyed from his father's Court, With men and steeds and store of wealth and arms, To the rich city where her father reigned, Its seven citadels set above the sea, Like seven Afrits, threatening all the world; And messengered the monarch with a gift Of savage vessels wroughten out of gold, Of foreign fabrics stiff with gems and gold. Vizier-ambassadored the old king gave His answer to the suitor:â âI, my son,â What grace have I beyond the grace of God? What power is mine but a material? What rule have I but a mere temporal? Me, than the shadow of the Prophet's shade Less, God invests with power but of man; Yea! and man's right is but the right of God; His the dominion of the secret soulâ And His her soul! Now hath my daughter sworn, By all her vestal soul, that none shall know Her but her better in the listed field, Determining spear and sword. Grant Fate thy trust. She hangs her hand upon to-morrow's joust.â Allah is great!âMy greeting and farewell.â And so the lists of war and love arose, Wherein Eddetma with her suitor strove. Mailed in Chorasmian armor, helm and spur, On a great steed she came; Davidean crest And hauberk one fierce blaze of gems. The prince, Harnessed in scaly gold Arabian, rode To meet her; on his arm a mighty shield Of Syrian silver high embossed with gold. So clanged the prologue of the battle. As Closer it waxed, Prince Behram, who a while Withheld his valor,âin that she he loved Opposed him and beset him, woman whom He had not scathed for the ChosroÃ«s' wealth,â Beheld his folly: how he were undone With shining shame unless he strove withal, Whirled fiery sword and smote the bassinet That helmed the haughty face that long had scorned The wide world's vanquished royalty, and so Rushed on his own defeat. For, like unto A cloud, that caverned the bright moon all eve, That thunder splits and, virgin triumph, there She sails a silver aspect, so the helm, Hurled from her head, unhusked her golden hair, And glorious, glowing face. By his own blow Was Behram vanquished. All his wavering strength Swerved from its purpose. With no final stroke Stunned stood he and surrendered: stared and stared, All his strong life absorbed into her face, All the wild warrior arrowed by her eyes, Tamed and obedient to her word and look. Then she on him, as eagle on a kite, Plunged pitiless and beautiful and fierce, On trophy more to added victories: Haled off his mail, amazement dazing him; Seized steed and arms, confusion filling him; And scoffed him forth brow-branded with his shame. Dazzled, six days he sat, a staring trance; But on the seventh, casting stupor off, Rose, and the straitness of the case, that held Him as with manacles of knitted fire, Consideredâand decided on a way . . . Once when Eddetma with an houri band Of high-born damsels, under eunuch guard, In the walled palace pleasaunce took her ease, Under a myrrh-bush by a fountain side,â Where marble Peris poured a diamond rain In scooped cornelian,âone, a dim, hoar head,â A patriarch 'mid gardener underlings,â Bent spreading gems and priceless ornaments Of jewelled amulets of hollow gold Sweet with imprisoned ambergris and musk; Symbolic stones in sorcerous carcanets; Gem talismans in cabalistic gold. Whereon the princess marvelled and bade askâ What did the ancient with his riches there? Who, questioned, mumbled in his bushy beard, âTo buy a wife withal;â whereat they laughed As oafs when wisdom stumbles. Quoth a maid, With orient midnight in her starry eyes, And tropic music on her languid tongue, âAnd what if I should wed with thee, O beard Grayer than my great-grandfather, what then?ââ âOne kiss, no more; and, child, thou were divorced,â He; and the humor took them till, like birds That sing among the spice-trees and the palms, The garden pealed with maiden merriment. Then quoth the princess, âThou wilt wed with him, Ansada?â mirth in her gazelle-like eyes, And gravity sage-solemn in her speech; And took Ansada's hand and laid it in The old man's staggering hand, and he unbent His crookÃ©d back and on his staff arose Wrinkled and weighed with many heavy years, And kissed her, leaning on his shaking staff, And heaped her bosom with an Amir's wealth, And left them laughing at his foolish beard. Now on the next day, as she took her ease With her glad troop of girlhood,âmaidens who So many royal tulips seemed,âbehold, Bowed with white years, upon a flowery sward The ancient with new jewelry and gems Wherefrom the sun coaxed wizard fires and lit Glimmers in glowing green and pendent pearl, Ultramarine and beaded, vivid rose. And so they stood and wondered; and one asked, As yesternoon, wherefore the father there Displayed his Sheikh locks and the genie gems.â âAnother marriage and another kiss?â What! doth the tomb-ripe court his youth again? O aged one, libertine in hope not deed! O prodigal of wives as well as wealth! Here stands thy damsel,â trilled the Peri-tall Diarra with the midnight in her hair, Two lemon-blossoms blowing in her cheeks; And took the dotard's jewels with the kiss In merry mockery. Ere the morrow's dawn Bethought Eddetma: âShall my handmaidens, Humoring a gray-beard's whim, for wrinkled smiles And withered kisses still divide his wealth? While I stand idle, lose the caravan Whose least is notable?âI too will wed, Betide me what betides.â And with the morn Before the man,âfor privily she came,â Stood habited, as were her tire-maids, In humbler raiment. Now the ancient saw And knew her for the princess that she was, And kindling gladness of the knowledge made Two sparkling forges of his deep-set eyes Beneath the ashes of his priestly brows. Not timidly she came; but coy approach Became a maiden of Eddetma's suite. She, gazing on the jewels he had spread Beneath the rose-bower by the fountain, said:â âThe princess gave me leave, O grandfather. Here is my hand in marriage, here my lips. Adorn thy bride; then grant me my divorce.â And humbly answered he, âWith all my heart!ââ Responsive to her quavering request,â âThe daughter of the king did give thee leave? And thou wouldst wed?âThen let us not delay.â Thy hand! thy lips!â So he arose and heaped Her with barbaric jewelry and gems, And took her hand and from her lips the kiss. Then from his age, behold, the dotage fell, And from the man all palsied hoariness. Victorious-eyed and amorous, a youth, A god in ardent capabilities, Resistless held her; and she, swooning, saw, Transfigured and triumphant bending o'er, Gloating, the branded brow of Prince Behram. TORQUEMADA To the Chapter of the Archbishop of Toledo. What doth the Archbishop, his chapter of Toledo?âYea! doze they above some Bullâ Some dull dry Bull Pope Sextus sent to rot? Come, come! awake! O prelates militant! Hear me! this is a truth I whisper now: Spain's King is less than king as I am less Than Paul the Apostle.âLook you! look around; Observe and dare!âI write above my seal, A grave Dominican, to postulate Pacheco, Marquis de Villena, croaks No nonsense in your excellencies' ears: King Henry's heir is illegitimate! Blanche of Navarre cast off, his Impotence Gave us a wanton out of Portugal For Queen; Joanna, who bore him this heir The cuckold King parades, a bastard, now. Look! all the Court laughsâsecretly: but masks Are but for slaves; the people's smile is free From all concealment; and the word still wags About this son,âwho is his favorite's, Bertrand la Cueva's, handsome exquisite,â Whom, people say,âand what they say is true,â The King himself, needing a lusty heir, Made warm familiar with Joanna's bed. What shall we do? endorse the infamy? Absolve them?âYea! absolve themâat the stake! Or, if not that, then with the axe that hews The neck of State asunder!âIs it well, Prelates and ministers? Be merciful?â Lest the disease of this delicious fruit, This Kingdom of Castile, corrode the core, Why not pare off all rottenness and leave The healthy pulp! The throne, the populace, The Church, and God demand the overthrow, Deponement or the abnegation of This Henry, named the Fourth, the impotent!â Alphonso lives. . . . (It is my guarded hope That brothers of such kings have no long life.)â Am I impatient? 'Tis the tonsure then; Ambition ever was and aye will be Cousined to fierce impatience. 'Tis the cowl, The tonsure and the cowl, they must advance! My native town, Valladolid, did sow The priestly germ, ambition, first in me; Rather 'twas planted there in me; and had, Despite the richness of the soil, poor growth And less encouragement; the nipping wind Of Court disfavor was too much for it; And so I bore it thence to Cordova, And sunned its torpor in a woman's smile, 'Neath which it sprouted butâwho trusts the sex?â Grew to a tenderness too insecure For love's black frosts. Required hardiness, And found it there at Zaragossa; (where Fat father LopÃ©s, bluff Dominican, My youth confuted with wise nonsense, and Astonished Spain in disputation in The public controversies of the monks). Transplanted to the Court, oh, splendid speed! Sure hath its growth been. Now a Cardinal's red Is promised by the bud that tops its stem. How have I, through the saintly medium Of the confessional, impressed the ear Of Isabella, daughter and dear child! The incarnation of my dear ideal, Pure crucifix of my religious love, Sweet cross which my ambition guards and holds: Ploughed up the early meadows of her soul For fruitful increase! in her maiden heart Insinuated subtleties of seed Shall ripen to a queen crowned with a crown From welded gold of Arragon and Castile! How I this son of John, the Second named, Prince Ferdinand of swarthy Arragon,â (Grant absolution, holy mother mine! Thus thy advancement and thy mastery Would I obtain!)âhave on her fancy limned In morning colors of proud chivalry! Till he a sceptered paladin of love And beaming manhood stands! She dreams, she dreams WhatâHeaven knows! 'Tis, haply, of a star She saw when but a babe and in the arms Of some old nurse. A star, that laughed above A space of Moorish balcony that hung Above a water full of upset stars; Reflected glimmers of old palace fÃªtes: A star she reached for, cried for, claimed her own, But never got; that blew young promises, Court promises, centupled, from the tips Of golden fingers at her infant eyes.â Well! when this girl is grown to be a queen, What if one, Torquemada, clothe her star In palpable approach and give it her!â When she is Queen, three steadfast purposes Have grown their causes to divine results.â No young imagination did I train With such endeavor and for no reward.â How often have I told her of the things She could perform when Queen, while silently And pensively she sat and, leaning, heard, Absorbed upon my face! her missal,âcrushed By one propped elbow, its bent, careless leaves Rich with illuminated capitals Of gold and purple,âopen on her lap. Long, long we sat thus, brothers, speaking of Felicity; discoursing earnestly Of Earth and Heaven; and of who adhere To God's true Vicar and our Holy Church: Beatitude and all the ceaseless bliss, Celestial, of eternal Paradise, As everlasting as the souls that have Built a strong tower for the only Faith. And I recall now how, in exhortation, Filled with the fervor of my cause I cried:â âWalk not on ways that lead but to despair, The easy ways of Satan! Rather thorns For naked feet that will not falter if Retentive of the arm of our true Church, Who comforts weariness with promises Still urging onward; and refreshes hearts With whisperings in the tuneless ear of Care.ââ And oft, big-eyed with innocence, she asked, âDo some digress?ââAnd I, âYea, many! yea! And there's necessity! we should annul, Pluck forth the canker that contaminates, Corrodes the milk-white beauty of our Rose.â God's persecution! they confront our Faith With brows of stigmatizing error writ In Hell's red handwriting. Shall such persist? No!âHeaven demands an end to all this shame!ââ Her pledge she gave me then: âWhen Queen, for Spain The Inquisition! Let the Saints record! I promise thee, my father, thou shalt be A mattock of deracination to Extirpate heresy.â Well, well; time goes: The world moves onward, and I still amâoh, Frere Torquemada, a Dominican! . . . Blind Spain hastes blindly forward, eager for Her Hellward plunge. Our need is absolute. Conclusion to these monster heresies Or their most imminent consequence!âThe throne, Which is derived directly from high God, Meseems should champion God in any cause; And if it will not, we will make it to.â O Spain, Spain, Spain! awake! arise! and crush These multiplying madnesses that mouth Their paradoxes at the Cross and shriek Their blasphemies e'en in the face of Christ!â O miserable Religion, is thy pride So fallen here! thy tenement of strength So powerless! Then where's security, When steadfast principle is insecure, And God's own pillars rock and none resists?â But I have tempered, at a certain heat, A heart of womanhood; and so have wrought The metal of a mind within the forge Of holy discourse, that Toledo's steel Springs not more true than my reforming blade, Which shall carve worship to a perfect whole.â Imperial Isabella! patroness! Protectress of pure faith! sweet Catholic! Our Church's dear concern! its bell, its book, Tribunal, and its godly Act of Faith! Hear how my soul cries out and speaks for thee!â My lord and brothers, hear me and perpend: This need is first: to make her sceptered Queen Of wide Castile. To make (the second need), Him, whom Ximenes, my friend Cordelier Shall serve as minister, King Ferdinand, Her wedded consort. And the third great need, The last,âwhich yet is first,âto scour from Spain These Moors, who make a brimstone-odious lair Of that rich region of Granada, which, Like some vile sore of scaly leprosy, Scabs Spain's fair face. Delay not. Let the Church Divide attention then 'twixt heretics And unclean Jews. So; wash her garments clean!â King Henry falls. God and Saint Dominick Aid our endeavor! and the Holy See Build firm foundations!âLet the corner-stone Of our most Holy Inquisition here Be mortared with the blood of heretics That its strong structure may endure!âAnd he, This Torquemada, the Dominican, Made Grand Inquisitor and Cardinal, This monk who writes you now, whose spirit feels That God inspires him with His own desires, Shall blaze God's name in blood upon the world.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Volume II NEW WORLD IDYLLS AND POEMS OF LOVE [NEW WORLD IDYLLS] [O lyrist of the lowly and the true] O lyrist of the lowly and the true, The song I sought for you Still bides-unsung. What hope for me to find, Lost in the dÃ¦dal mind, The living utterance with lovely tongue, To sing,âas once he sung, Rare Ariosto, of Knight-Errantry,â How you in Poesy, Song's Paladin, Knight of the Dream and Day, The shield of magic sway! Of that Atlantes' power, sweet and terse, The skyey-builded verse! The shield that dazzles, brilliant with surprise, Our unanointed eyes.â Oh, could I write as it were worthy you, Each word, a spark of dew,â As once Ferdusi wrote in Persia,â Would string each rosy spray Of each unfolding flower of my song; And Iran's bulbul tongue Would sob its heart out o'er the fountain's slab In gardens of Afrasiab. ONE DAY AND ANOTHER A Lyrical Eclogue PART I LATE SPRING The mottled moth at eventide Beats glimmering wings against the pane; The slow, sweet lily opens wide, White in the dusk like some dim stain; The garden dreams on every side And breathes faint scents of rain: Among the flowering stocks they stand; A crimson rose is in her hand. I Outside her garden. He waits musing: Herein the dearness of her is; The thirty perfect days of June Made one, in maiden loveliness Were not more sweet to clasp and kiss, With love not more in tune. Ah me! I think she is too true, Too spiritual for life's rough way: So say her eyes,âher soul looks through,â Two bluet blossoms, watchet-blue, Are not more pure than they. So kind, so beautiful is she, So soft and white, so fond and fair, Sometimes my heart fears she may be Not long for Earth, and secretly Sweet sister to the air. II Dusk deepens. A whippoorwill calls. The whippoorwills are calling where The golden west is graying; â'Tis time,â they say, âto meet him thereâ Why are you still delaying? âHe waits you where the old beech throws Its gnarly shadow over Wood violet and the bramble rose, Frail lady-fern and clover. âWhere elder and the sumac peep Above your garden's paling, Whereon, at noon, the lizards sleep, Like lichen on the railing. âCome! ere the early rising moon's Gold floods the violet valleys; Where mists, like phantom picaroons Anchor their stealthy galleys. âCome! while the deepening amethyst Of dusk above is fallingâ 'Tis time to tryst! 'tis time to tryst!â The whippoorwills are calling. They call you to these twilight ways With dewy odor drippingâ Ah, girlhood, through the rosy haze Come like a moonbeam slipping. III He enters the garden, speaking dreamily: There is a fading inward of the day, And all the pansy sunset clasps one star; The twilight acres, eastward, glimmer gray, While all the world to westward smoulders far. Now to your glass will you pass for the last time? Pass! humming some ballad, I know. Here where I wait it is late and is past timeâ Late! and the moments are slow, are slow. There is a drawing downward of the night; The bridegroom Heaven bends down to kiss the moon: Above, the heights hang silver in her light; Below, the vales stretch purple, deep with June. There in the dew is it you hiding lawny? You? or a moth in the vines?â You!âby your hand! where the band twinkles tawny! You!âby your ring, like a glow-worm that shines! IV She approaches, laughing. She speaks: You'd given up hope? He Believe me! She Why! is your love so poor? He No. Yet you might deceive me! She As many a girl before.â Ah, dear, you will forgive me? He Say no more, sweet, say no more! She Love trusts; and that's enough, my dear. Trust wins through love; whereof, my dear, Love holds through trust: and love, my dear, Isâall my life and lore. He Come, pay me or I'll scold you.â Give me the kiss you owe.â You run when I would hold you? She No! no! I say! now, no!â How often have I told you, You must not use me so? He More sweet the dusk for this is, For lips that meet in kisses.â Come! come! why run from blisses As from a dreadful foe? V She stands smiling at him, shyly, then speaks: How many words in the asking! How easily I can grieve you!â My âyesâ in a ânoâ was a-masking, Nor thought, dear, to deceive you.â A kiss?âthe humming-bird happiness here In my heart consents. ... But what are words, When the thought of two souls in speech accords? Affirmative, negativeâwhat are they, dear? I wished to say âyes,â but somehow said âno.â The woman within me knew you would know, Knew that your heart would hear. He speaks: So many words in the doing!â Therein you could not deceive me; Some things are sweeter for the pursuing: I knew what you meant, believe me.â Bunched bells of the blush pomegranate, to fix At your throat ... Six drops of fire they are ... Will you lookâwhere the moon and its following star Rise silvery over yon meadow ricks? While I holdâwhile I bend your head back, so ... For I know it is âyesâ though you whisper âno,â And my kisses, sweet, are six. VI Moths flutter around them. She speaks: Look!âwhere the fiery Glow-worm in briery Banks of the moon-mellowed bowers Sparklesâhow hazily Pinioned and airily Delicate, warily, Drowsily, lazily, Flutter the moths to the flowers. White as the dreamiest Bud of the creamiest Rose in the garden that dozes, See how they cling to them! Held in the heart of their Hearts, like a part of their Perfume, they swing to them Wings that are soft as a rose is. Dim as the forming of Dew in the warming of Moonlight, they light on the petals; All is revealed to them; All!âfrom the sunniest Tips to the honiest Heart, whence they yield to them Spice, through the darkness that settles. So to our tremulous Souls come the emulous Agents of love; through whose power All that is best in us, All that is beautiful, Selfless and dutiful, Is manifest in us, Even as the scent of a flower. VII Taking her hand he says: What makes you beautiful? Answer, now, answer!â Is it that dutiful Souls are all beautiful? Is it romance or Beauty of spirit, Which souls, that merit, Of heaven inherit?â Have you an answer? She, roguishly: What makes you lovable? Answer, now, answer!â Is it not provable That man is lovable Just because chance, or Nature, makes woman Love him?âHer human Part 's to illumine.â Have you an answer? VIII Then, regarding him seriously, she continues: Could I recall every joy that befell me There in the past with its anguish and bliss, Here in my heart it hath whispered to tell me,â They were no joys like this. Were it not well if our love could forget them, Veiling the Was with the dawn of the Is? Dead with the past we should never regret them, Being no joys like this. Now they are gone and the Present stands speechful, Ardent of word and of look and of kiss,â What though we know that their eyes are beseechful!â They were no joys like this. Were it not well to have more of the spirit, Living high Futures this earthly must miss? Less of the flesh, with the Past pining near it? Knowing no joys like this! IX Leaving the garden for the lane. He, with lightness of heart: We will leave reason, Sweet, for a season: Reason were treason Now that the nether Spaces are clad, oh, In silvery shadowâ We will be glad, oh, Glad as this weather! She, responding to his mood: Heart unto heart! where the moonlight is slanted, Let us believe that our souls are enchanted:â I in the castle-keep; you are the airy Prince who comes seeking me; love is the fairy Bringing us two together. He Starlight in masses Over us passes; And in the grass is Many a flower.â Now will you tell me How 'd you enspell me? What once befell me There in your bower? She Soul unto soul!âin the moon's wizard glory, Let us believe we are parts in a story:â I am a poem; a poet you hear it Whispered in star and in flower; a spirit, Love, puts my soul in your power. X He, suddenly and very earnestly: Perhaps we lived in the days Of the Khalif Haroun er Reshid; And loved, as the story says Did the Sultan's favorite one And the Persian Emperor's son, Ali ben Bekkar, he Of the Kisra dynasty. Do you know the story?âWell, You were Haroun's Sultana. When night on the palace fell, A slave, through a secret door,â Low-arched on the Tigris' shore,â By a hidden winding stair Brought me to your bower there. Then there was laughter and mirth, And feasting and singing together, In a chamber of wonderful worth; In a chamber vaulted high On columns of ivory; Its dome, like the irised skies, Mooned over with peacock eyes; Its curtains and furniture, Damask and juniper. Ten slave girlsâso many bloomsâ Stand, holding tamarisk torches, Silk-clad from the Irak looms; Ten handmaidens serve the feast, Each maid like a star in the east; Ten lutanists, lutes a-tune, Wait, each like the Ramadan moon. For you, in a stuff of Merv Blue-clad, unveiled and jeweled, No metaphor made may serve: Scarved deep with your raven hair, The jewels like fireflies thereâ Blossom and moon and star, The Lady Shemsennehar. The zone that girdles your waist Would ransom a Prince and Emeer; In your coronet's gold enchased, And your bracelet's twisted bar, Burn rubies of Istakhar; And pearls of the Jamshid race Hang looped on your bosom's lace. You stand like the letter I; Dawn-faced, with eyes that sparkle Black stars in a rosy sky; Mouth, like a cloven peach, Sweet with your smiling speech; Cheeks, that the blood presumes To make pomegranate blooms. With roses of Rocknabad, Hyacinths of Bokhara,â Creamily cool and clad In gauze,âgirls scatter the floor From pillar to cedarn door. Then, a pomegranate bloom in each ear, Come the dancing-girls of Kashmeer. Kohl in their eyes, down the room,â That opaline casting-bottles Have showered with rose-perfume,â They glitter and drift and swoon To the dulcimer's languishing tune; In the liquid light like stars And moons and nenuphars. Carbuncles, tragacanth-red, Smoulder in armlet and anklet: Gleaming on breast and on head, Bangles of coins, that are angled, Tinkle: and veils, that are spangled, Flutter from coiffure and wrist Like a star-bewildered mist. Each dancing-girl is a flower Of the Tuba from vales of El Liwa.â How the bronzen censers glower! And scents of ambergris pour, And of myrrh, brought out of Lahore, And of musk of Khoten! how good Is the scent of the sandalwood! A lutanist smites her lute, Sings loves of Mejnoon and Leila:â Her voice is an Houri flute;â While the fragrant flambeaux wave, Barbaric, o'er free and slave, O'er fabrics and bezels of gems And roses in anadems. Sherbets in ewers of gold, Fruits in salvers carnelian; Flagons of grotesque mold, Made of a sapphire glass, Brimmed with wine of ShirÃ¢z; Shaddock and melon and grape On plate of an antique shape. Vases of frosted rose, Of alabaster graven, Filled with the mountain snows; Goblets of mother-of-pearl, One filigree silver-swirl; Vessels of gold foamed up With spray of spar on the cup. Then a slave bursts in with a cry: âThe eunuchs! the Khalif's eunuchs!â With scimitars bared draw nigh! Wesif and Afif and he, Chief of the hideous three, Mesrour!âthe Sultan 's seen 'Mid a hundred weapons' sheen!â Did we part when we heard this?âNo! It seems that my soul remembers How I clasped and kissed you, so. ... When they came they found usâdead, On the flowers our blood dyed red; Our lips together, and The dagger in my hand. XI She, musingly: How it was I can not tell, For I know not where nor why; But I know we loved too well In some world that does not lie East or west of where we dwell, And beneath no earthly sky. Was it in the golden ages?â Or the iron?âthat I heard,â In the prophecy of sages,â Haply, how had come a bird, Underneath whose wing were pages Of an unknown lover's word. I forget. You may remember How the earthquake shook our ships; How our city, one huge ember, Blazed within the thick eclipse: When you found meâdeep December Sealed my icy eyes and lips. I forget. No one may say That such things can not be true:â Here a flower dies to-day, There, to-morrow, blooms anew. ... Death is silent.âTell me, pray, Why men doubt what God can do? XII He, with conviction: As to that, nothing to tell! You being all my belief, Doubt can not enter or dwell Here where your image is chief; Here where your name is a spell, Potent in joy and in grief. Is it the glamour of spring Working in us so we seem Aye to have loved? that we cling Even to some fancy or dream, Rainbowing everything, Here in our souls, with its gleam? See! how the synod is met There of the planets to preach us:â Freed from the earth's oubliette, See how the blossoms beseech us!â Were it not well to forget Winter and death as they teach us? Dew and a bud and a star, All,âlike a beautiful thought, Over man's wisdom how far!â God for some purpose hath wrought.â Could we but know why they are, And that they end not in naught! Stars and the moon; and they roll Over our way that is white.â Here shall we end the long stroll? Here shall I kiss you good night? Or, for a while, soul to soul, Linger and dream of delight? XIII They reÃ«nter the garden. She speaks somewhat pensively: Myths tell of walls and cities, lyred of love, That rose to music.âWere that power my own, Had I that harp, that magic barbiton, What had I builded for our lives thereof?â In docile shadows under bluebell skies, A home upon the poppied edge of eve, Beneath pale peaks the splendors never leave, 'Mid lemon orchards whence the egret flies. Where, pitiless, the ruined hand of death Should never reach. No bud, no flower fade: Where all were perfect, pure and unafraid: And life serener than an angel's breath. The days should move to music: song should tame The nights, attentive with their listening stars: And morn outrival eve in opal bars, Each preaching beauty with rose-tongues of flame. O home! O life! desired and to be! How shall we reach you?âFar the way and dim.â Give me your hand, sweet! let us follow him, Love with the madness and the melody. XIV He, observing the various flowers around them: Violets and anemones The surrendered Hours Pour, as handsels, round the knees Of the Spring, who to the breeze Flings her myriad flowers. Like to coins, the sumptuous day Strews with blossoms golden Every furlong of his way,â Like a Sultan gone to pray At a Kaaba olden. Warlock Night, with spark on spark, Clad in dim attire, Dots with stars the haloed dark,â As a priest around the Ark Lights his lamps of fire. These are but the cosmic strings Of the harp of Beauty, Of that instrument which sings, In our souls, of love, that brings Peace and faith and duty. XV She, seriously: Duty?âComfort of the sinner And the saint!âWhen grief and trial Weigh us, and within our inner Selves,âresponsive to love's viol,â Hope's soft voice grows thin and thinner. It is kin to self-denial. Self-denial! Through whose feeling We are gainer though we 're loser; All the finer force revealing Of our natures. No accuser Is the conscience then, but healing Of the wound of which we 're chooser. Who the loser, who the winner, If the ardor fail as preacher?â None who loved was yet beginner, Though another's love-beseecher: Love's revealment 's of the inner Life and God Himself is teacher. Heine said âno flower knoweth Of the fragrance it revealeth; Song, its heart that overfloweth, Never nightingale's heart feelethââ Such is love the spirit groweth, Love unconscious if it healeth. XVI He, looking smilingly into her eyes, after a pause, lightly: An elf there is who stables the hot Red wasp that sucks on the apricot; An elf, who rowels his spiteful bay, Like a mote on a ray, away, away; An elf, who saddles the hornet lean And dins i' the ear o' the swinging bean; Who straddles, with cap cocked, all awry, The bottle-green back o' the dragon-fly. And this is the elf who sips and sips From clover-horns whence the perfume drips; And, drunk with dew, in the glimmering gloam Awaits the wild-bee's coming home; In ambush lies where none may see, And robs the caravan bumblebee: Gold bags of honey the bees must pay To the bandit elf of the fairy-way. Another ouphen the butterflies know, Who paints their wings with the hues that glow On blossoms: squeezing from tubes of dew Pansy colors of every hue On his bloom's pied pallet, he paints the wings Of the butterflies, moths, and other things. This is the elf that the hollyhocks hear, Who dangles a brilliant in each one's ear; Teases at noon the pane's green fly, And lights at night the glow-worm's eye. But the dearest elf, so the poets say, Is the elf who hides in an eye of gray; Who curls in a dimple or slips along The strings of a lute to a lover's song; Who smiles in her smile and frowns in her frown, And dreams in the scent of her glove or gown; Hides and beckons, as all may note, In the bloom or the bow of a maiden's throat. XVII She, pensively, standing among the flowers: Soft through the trees the night wind sighs, And swoons and dies. Above, the stars hang wanly white; Here, through the dark, A drizzled gold, the fireflies Rain mimic stars in spark on spark.â 'Tis time to part, to say good night. Good night. From fern to flower the night-moths cross At drowsy loss. The moon drifts, veiled, through clouds of white; And pearly pale, In silvery blurs, through beds of moss, Their tiny moons the glow-worms trail.â 'Tis time to part, to say good night. Good night. XVIII He, at parting, as they proceed down the garden: You say we can not marry, now That roses and the June are here? To your decision I must bow.â Ah, well!âperhaps 't is best, my dear. Let 's swear again each old love vow And love another year. Another year of love with you! Of dreams and days, of sun and rain! When field and forest bloom anew, And locust clusters pelt the lane, When all the song-birds wed and woo, I'll not take ânoâ again. Oft shall I lie awake and mark The hours by no clanging clock, But, in the dim and dewy dark, Far crowing of some punctual cock; Then up, as early as the lark To meet you by our rock. The rock, where first we met at tryst; Where first I wooed and won your love.â Remember how the moon and mist Made mystery of the heaven above As now to-night?âWhere first I kissed Your lips, you trembling like a dove. So, then, we will not marry now That roses and the June are here, That warmth and fragrance weigh each bough? And, yet, your reason is not clear ... Ah, well! We'll swear anew each vow And wait another year. PART II EARLY SUMMER The cricket in the rose-bush hedge Sings by the vine-entangled gate; The slim moon slants a timid edge Of pearl through one low cloud of slate; Around dark door and window-ledge Like dreams the shadows wait. And through the summer dusk she goes, On her white breast a crimson rose. I She delays, meditating. A rainy afternoon. Gray skies and a foggy rain Dripping from streaming eaves; Over and over again Dull drop of the trickling leaves: And the woodward-winding lane, And the hill with its shocks of sheaves One scarce perceives. Shall I go in such wet weather By the lane or over the hill?â Where the blossoming milkweed's feather The diamonded rain-drops fill; Where, draggled and drenched together, The ox-eyes rank the rill By the old corn-mill. The creek by now is swollen, And its foaming cascades sound; And the lilies, smeared with pollen, In the dam look dull and drowned. 'Tis the path I oft have stolen To the bridge; that rambles round With willows bound. Through a bottom wild with berry, And packed with the ironweeds And elder,âwashed and very Fragrant,âthe fenced path leads Past oak and wilding cherry, Where the tall wild-lettuce seeds, To a place of reeds. The sun through the sad sky bleachesâ Is that a thrush that calls?â A bird in the rain beseeches: And see! on the balsam's balls, And leaves of the water-beechesâ One blister of wart-like gallsâ No rain-drop falls. My shawl instead of a bonnet! ... 'Though the woods be dripping yet, Through the wet to the rock I'll run it!â How sweet to meet in the wet!â Our rock with the vine upon it,â Each flower a fiery jet,â Where oft we 've met. II They meet. He speaks: How fresh the purple clover Smells in its veil of rain! And where the leaves brim over How musky wild the lane! See, how the sodden acres, Forlorn of all their rakers, Their hay and harvest makers, Look green as spring again. Drops from the trumpet-flowers Rain on us as we pass; And every zephyr showers, From tilted leaf or grass, Clear beads of moisture, seeming Pale, pointed emeralds gleaming; Where, through the green boughs streaming, The daylight strikes like glass. She speaks: How dewy, clean and fragrant Look now the green and gold!â And breezes, trailing vagrant, Spill all the spice they hold. The west begins to glimmer; And shadows, stretching slimmer, Make gray the ways; and dimmer Grow field and forest old. Beyond those rainy reaches Of woodland, far and lone, A whippoorwill beseeches; And now an owlet's moan Drifts faint upon the hearing.â These say the dusk is nearing. And, see, the heavens, clearing, Take on a tender tone. How feebly chirps the cricket! How thin the tree-toads cry! Blurred in the wild-rose thicket Gleams wet the firefly.â This way toward home is nearest; Of weeds and briers clearest. ... We'll meet to-morrow, dearest; Till then, dear heart, good-by. III They meet again under the greenwood tree. He speaks: Here at last! And do you know That again you 've kept me waiting? Wondering, anticipating That your âyesâ meant âno.â Now you 're here we'll have our day. ... Let us take this daisied hollow, And beneath these beeches follow This wild strip of way To the stream; wherein are seen Stealing gar and darting minnow; Over which snake-feeders winnow Wings of black and green. Like a cactus flames the sun; And the mighty weaver, Even, Tenuous colored, there in heaven, His rich weft 's begun. ... How I love you! from the timeâ You remember, do you not?â When, within your orchard-plot, I was reading rhyme, As I told you. And 't was thus:â âBy the blue Trinacrian sea, Far in pastoral Sicily With Theocritusââ That I answered you who asked. But the curious part was this:â That the whole thing was amiss; That the Greek but masked Tales of old Boccaccio: Tall Decameronian maids Strolled for me among the glades, Smiling, sweet and slow. And when you approached,âmy book Dropped in wonder,âseemingly To myself I said, â'Tis she!â And arose to look In Lauretta's eyes andâtrue! Found them yours.âYou shook your head, Laughing at me, as you said, âDid I frighten you?â You had come for cherries; these Coatless then I climbed for while You still questioned with a smile, And still tried to tease. Ah, love, just two years have gone Since then. ... I remember, you Wore a dress of billowy blue Muslin.âWas it âlawnâ?â And your apron still I seeâ All its whiteness cherry-stainedâ Which you held; wherein I rained Ripeness from the tree. And I asked youâfor, you know, To my eyes your serious eyes Said such deep philosophiesâ If you 'd read Rousseau. You remember how a chance, Somewhat like to mine, one June Happened him at castle Toune, Over there in France? And a cherry dropping fair On your cheek, I, envying it, Criedâremembering Rousseau's witâ âWould my lips were there!â ... Here we are at last. We'll row Down the stream.âThe west has narrowed To one streak of rose, deep-arrowed.â There 's our skiff below. IV Entering the skiff, she speaks: Waters flowing dark and bright In the sunlight or the moon, Fill my soul with such delight As some visible music might; As some slow, majestic tune Made material to the sight. Blossoms colored like the skies, Sunset-hued and tame or wild, Fill my soul with such surmise As the mind might realize If one's thoughts, all undefiled, Should take form before the eyes. So to me do these appeal; So they sway me every hour: Letting all their beauty steal On my soul to make it feel Through a rivulet or flower, More than any words reveal. V He speaks, rowing: See, sweetheart, how the lilies lay Their lambent leaves about our way; Or, pollen-dusty, bob and float Their nenuphars around our boat.â The middle of the stream is reached Three strokes from where our boat was beached. Look up. You scarce can see the sky, Through trees that lean, dark, dense and high; That, coiled with grape and trailing vine, Build vast a roof of shade and shine; A house of leaves, where shadows walk, And whispering winds and waters talk. There is no path. The saplings choke The trunks they spring from. There an oak, Floods from the Alleghanies bore, Lies rotting; and that sycamore, Which lays its bulk from shore to shore,â Uprooted by the rain,âperchance May be the bridge to some romance: Its heart of punk, a spongy white, Glows, ghostly foxfire, in the night. Now opening through a willow fringe The waters creep, one tawny tinge Of sunset; and on either marge The cottonwoods make walls of shade, With breezy balsam pungent: large, The gradual hills loom; darkly fade The waters wherein herons wade, Or wing, like FaÃ«ry birds, from grass That mats the shore by which we pass. She speaks: On we pass; we rippling pass, On sunset waters still as glass. A vesper-sparrow flies above, Soft twittering, to its woodland love. A tufted-titmouse calls afar: And from the west, like some swift star, A glittering jay flies screaming. Slim The sand-snipes and kingfishers skim Before us; and some twilight thrushâ Who may discover where such sing?â The silence rinses with a gush Of limpid music bubbling. He speaks: On we pass.âNow let us oar To yonder strip of ragged shore, Where, from a rock with lichens hoar, A ferny spring falls, babbling frore Through woodland mosses. Gliding by The sulphur-colored firefly Lights its pale lamp where mallows gloom, And wild-bean and wild-mustard bloom.â Some hunter there within the woods Last fall encamped, those ashes say And campfire boughs.âThe solitudes Grow dreamy with the death of day. VI She sings: Over the fields of millet A young bird tries its wings; And wild as a woodland rillet, Its first mad music ringsâ Soul of my soul, where the meadows roll What is the song it sings? âLove, and a glad good-morrow, Heart where the rapture is! Good-morrow, good-morrow! Adieu to sorrow! Here is the road to bliss: Where all day long you may hearken my song, And kiss, kiss, kiss;â Over the fields of clover, Where the wild bee drones and sways, The wind, like a shepherd lover, Flutes on the fragrant waysâ Heart of my heart, where the blossoms part, What is the air he plays? âLove, and a song to follow, Soul with the face a-gleam! Come follow, come follow, O'er hill and through hollow, To the land o' the bloom and beam: Where, under the flowers, you may listen for hours. And dream, dream, dream!â VII He speaks, letting the boat drift: Here the shores are irised; grasses Clump the water gray, that glasses Broken wood and deepened distance. Far the musical persistence Of a field-lark lingers low In the west's rich tulip-glow. White before us flames one pointed Star; and Day hath Night anointed King; from out her azure ewer Pouring starry fire, truer Than pure gold. Star-crowned he stands With the starlight in his hands. Will the moon bleach through the ragged Tree-tops ere we reach yon jagged Rock that rises gradually, Pharos of our homeward valley?â All the west is smouldering red; Embers are the stars o'erhead. At my soul some Protean elf is: You 're SimÃ¦tha; I am Delphis, You are Sappho and your Phaon, I.âWe love.âThere lies our way, on,â Let us say,âÃolian seas, To the violet Lesbian leas. On we drift. I love you. Nearer Looms our Island. Rosier, clearer, The Leucadian cliff we follow, Where the temple of Apollo Shinesâa pale and pillared fire. ... Strike, oh, strike the Lydian lyre!â Out of Hellas blows the breeze Singing to the Sapphic seas. VIII Landing, he sings: Night, night, 't is night. The moon drifts low above us, And all its gold is tangled in the stream: Love, love, my love, and all the stars, that love us, The stars smile down and every star 's a dream. In odorous purple, where the falling warble Of water cascades and the plunged foam glows, A columned ruin lifts its sculptured marble Friezed with the chiselled rebeck and the rose. She sings: Sleep, sleep, sweet sleep sleeps at the drifting tiller, And in our sail the Spirit of the Rainâ Love, love, my love, ah, bid thy heart be stiller, And, hark! the music of the singing main. What flowers are those that blow their balm unto us, From mouths of wild aroma, each a flame?â Or is it Love that breathes? sweet Love who drew us, Who kissed our eyes and made us see the same? He speaks: Dreams; dreams we dream! no dream that we would banish! The temple and the nightingale are there! Our love hath made them, nevermore to vanish, Real as yon moon, this wild-rose in your hair. Night, night, 't is night!âand Love's own star 's before us, Its starred reflection in the starry stream.â Yes, yes, ah yes! his presence shall watch o'er us, To-night, to-night, and every night we dream. IX Homeward through flowers; she speaks: Behold the offerings of the common hills! Whose lowly names have made them three times dear: One evening-primrose and an apron-full Of violets; and there, in multitudes, Dim-seen in moonlight, sweet cerulean wan, The bluet, making heaven of every dell With morn's ambrosial blue: dew-dropping plumes Of the mauve beard's-tongue; and the red-freaked cups Of blackberry-lilies all along the creek, Where, lulled, the freckled silence sleeps, and vague The water flows, when, at high noon, the cows Wade knee-deep, and the heat is honied with The drone of drowsy bees and dizzy flies. How bright the moon is on that fleur-de-lis; Blue, streaked with crystal like a summer day: And is it moonlight there? or is it flowers? White violets? lilies? or a daisy bed? And now the wind, with softest lullaby, Swings all their cradled heads and rocks-to-sleep Their fragrant faces and their golden eyes, Curtained, and frailly wimpled with the dew. Simple suggestions of a life most fair! Flowers, you speak of love and untaught faith, Whose habitation is within the soul, Not of the Earth, yet for the Earth indeed. ... What is it halcyons my heart? makes calm, With calmness not of knowledge, all my soul This night of nights?âIs 't love? or faith? or both?â The lore of all the world is less than these Simple suggestions of a life most fair, And love most sweet that I have learned to know! X He speaks, musingly: Yes, I have known its being so; Long ago was I seeing soâ Beckoning on to a fairer land, Out of the flowers it waved its hand; Bidding me on to life and love, Life with the hope of the love thereof. What is the value of knowing it, If you are shy in showing it?â Need of the earth unfolds the flower, Dewy sweet, at the proper hour; And, in the world of the human heart, Love is the flower's counterpart. So when the soul is heedable, Then is the heart made readable.â I in the book of your heart have read Words that are truer than truth hath said: Measures of love, the spirit's song, Writ of your soul to haunt me long. Love can hear each laudable Thought of the loved made audible, Spoken in wonder, or joy, or pain, And reÃ«cho it back again: Ever responsive, ever awake, Ever replying with ache for ache. XI She speaks, dreamily: Earth gives its flowers to us And heaven its stars. Indeed, These are as lips that woo us, Those are as lights that lead, With love that doth pursue us, With hope that still doth speed. Yet shall the flowers lie riven, And lips forget to kiss; The stars fade out of heaven, And lights lead us amissâ As love for which we 've striven; As hope that promises. XII He laughs, wishing to dispel her seriousness: If love I have had of you, you had of me, Then doubtless our loving were over; One would be less than the other, you see; Since what you returned to your lover Were only his own; andâ XIII She interrupts him, speaking impetuously: But if I lose you, if you part with me, I will not love you less Loving so much now. If there is to be A parting and distress,â What will avail to comfort or relieve The soul that 's anguished most?â The knowledge that it once possessed, perceive, The love that it has lost. You must acknowledge, under sun and moon All that we feel is old; Let morning flutter from night's brown cocoon Wide wings of flaxen gold; The moon burst through the darkness, soaring o'er, Like some great moth and white, These have been seen a myriad times before And with renewed delight.â So 'tis with love;âhow old yet new it is!â This only should we heed,â To once have known, to once have felt love's bliss, Is to be rich indeed.â Whether we win or lose, we lose or win, Within our gain or loss Some purpose lies, some end unseen of sin, Beyond our crown or cross. XIV Nearing her home, he speaks: True, true!âPerhaps it would be best To be that lone star in the west; Above the earth, within the skies, Yet shining here in your blue eyes. Or, haply, better here to blow A flower beneath your window low; That, brief of life and frail and fair, Finds yet a heaven in your hair. Or well, perhaps, to be the breeze That sighs its soul out to the trees; A voice, a breath of rain or drouth, That has its wild will with your mouth. These things I long to be. I long To be the burthen of some song You love to sing; a melody, Sure of sweet immortality. XV At the gate. She speaks: Sunday shall we ride together? Not the root-rough, rambling way Through the wood we went that day, In last summer's sultry weather. Past the Methodist camp-meeting, Where religion helped the hymn Gather volume; and a slim Minister, with textful greeting, Welcomed us and still expounded.â From the service on the hill We had passed three hills and still Loud, though far, the singing sounded. Nor that road through weed and berry Drowsy days led me and you To the old-time barbecue, Where the country-side made merry. Dusty vehicles together; Darkies with the horses near Tied to trees; the atmosphere Redolent of bark and leather, And of burgoo and of beef; there Roasting whole within the trench; Near which spread the long pine bench Under shading limb and leaf there. As we went the homeward journey You exclaimed, âThey intermix Pleasure there and politics, Love and war: our modern tourney.â And the fiddles!âthrough the thickets, How they thumped the old quadrille! Scraping, droning on the hill, It was like a swarm of crickets. ... Neither road! The shady quiet Of that path by beech and birch, Winding to the ruined church Near the stream that sparkles by it. Where the silent Sundays listen For the preacherâLoveâwe bring In our hearts to preach and sing Week-day shade to Sabbath glisten. XVI He, at parting: Yes, to-morrow. Early morn.â When the House of Day uncloses Portals that the stars adorn,â Whence Light's golden presence throws his Flaming lilies, burning roses, At the wide wood's world of wall, Spears of sparkle at each fall: Then together we will ride To the wood's cathedral places; Where, like prayers, the wildflowers hide, Sabbath in their fairy faces; Where, in truest, untaught phrases, Worship in each rhythmic word, God is praised by many a bird. Look above you.âPearly white, Star on star now crystallizes Out of darkness: Afric night Hangs them round her like devices Of strange jewels. Vapor rises, Glimmering, from each wood and dell.â Till to-morrow, then, farewell. XVII She tarries at the gate a moment, watching him disappear down the lane. He sings, and the sound of his singing grows fainter and fainter and at last dies away in the distance: Say, my heart, O my heart, These be the eves for speaking! There is no wight will work us spite Beneath the sunset's streaking. Yes, my sweet, O my sweet, Now is the time for telling! To walk together in starry weather Down lanes with elder smelling. O my heart, yes, my heart, Now is the time for saying! When lost in dreams each wildflower seems And every blossom praying. Lean, my sweet, listen, sweet,â No sweeter time than this is,â So says the rose, the moth that knows,â To take sweet toll in kisses. PART III LATE SUMMER Heat lightning flickers in one cloud, As in a flower a firefly; Some rain-drops, that the rose-bush bowed, Jar through the leaves and dimly lie: Among the trees, now low, now loud, The whispering breezes sigh. The place is lone; the night is hushed; Upon the path a rose lies crushed. I Musing, he strolls among the quiet lanes by farm and field: Now rests the season in forgetfulness, Careless in beauty of maturity; The ripened roses round brown temples, she Fulfils completion in a dreamy guess. Now Time grants night the more and day the less: The gray decides; and brown, Dim golds and drabs in dulling green express Themselves and redden as the year goes down. Sadder the fields where, thrusting hoary high Their tasseled heads, the Lear-like corn-stocks die, And, Falstaff-like, buff-bellied pumpkins lie.â Deeper to tenderness, Sadder the blue of hills that lounge along The lonesome west; sadder the song Of the wild red-bird in the leafage yellow.â Deeper and dreamier, ay! Than woods or waters, leans the languid sky Above lone orchards where the cider-press Drips and the russets mellow. Nature grows liberal: from the beechen leaves The beech-nuts' burrs their little pockets thrust, Bulged with the copper of the nuts that rust; Above the grass the spendthrift spider weaves A web of silver for which dawn designs Thrice twenty rows of pearls: beneath the oak, That rolls old roots in many gnarly lines,â The polished acorns, from their saucers broke, Strew oval agates.âOn sonorous pines The far wind organs; but the forest near Is silent; and the blue-white smoke Of burning brush, beyond that field of hay, Hangs like a pillar in the atmosphere; But now it shakesâit breaks and all the vines And tree-tops tremble;âsee! the wind is here! Billowing and boisterous; and the smiling day Rejoices in its clamor. Earth and sky Resound with glory of its majesty, Impetuous splendor of its rushing by.â But on those heights the forest still is still, Expectant of its coming. ... Far away Each anxious tree upon each waiting hill Tingles anticipation, as in gray Surmise of rapture. Now the first gusts play, Like laughter low, about their rippling spines; And now the wildwood, one exultant sway, Shoutsâand the light at each tumultuous pause, The light that glooms and shines, Seems hands in wild applause. How glows that garden! though the white mists keep The vagabonding flowers reminded of Decay that comes to slay in open love, When the full moon hangs cold and night is deep; Unheeding still, their cardinal colors leap And laugh encircled of the scythe of death,â Like lovely children he prepares to reap,â Staying his blade a breath To mark their beauty ere, with one last sweep, He lays them dead and turns away to weep.â Let me admire,â Before the sickle of the coming cold Shall mow them down,âtheir beauties manifold: How like to spurts of fire That scarlet salvia lifts its blooms, which heap Yon square of sunlight. And, as sparkles creep Through charring parchment, up that window's screen The cypress dots with crimson all its green, The haunt of many bees. Cascading dark those porch-built lattices, The nightshade bleeds with berries; drops of blood, Hanging in clusters, 'mid the blue monk'shood. There, in that garden old, The bright-hued clumps of zinnias unfold Their formal flowers; and the marigold Lifts its pinched shred of orange sunset caught And elfed in petals. The nasturtium, All pungent leaved and acrid of perfume, Hangs up its goblin bonnet, fairy-brought From Gnomeland. There, predominant red, And arrogant, the dahlia lifts its head, Beside the balsam's rose-stained horns of honey, Deep in the mumuring, sunny Dry wildness of the weedy flower-bed; Where crickets and the weed-bugs, noon and night, Shrill dirges for the flowers that soon will die, And flowers already dead.â I seem to hear the passing Summer sigh: A voice, that seems to weep, âToo soon, too soon the Beautiful passes by! And soon, amid her bowers, Will dripping Autumn mourn with all her flowers.ââ If I, perchance, might peep Beneath those leaves of podded hollyhocks, That the bland wind with odorous whispers rocks, I might behold her,âwhite And weary,âSummer, 'mid her flowers asleep, Her drowsy flowers asleep, The withered poppies knotted in her locks. II He is reminded of another day with her: The hips were reddening on this rose, Those haws were hung with fire, That day we went this way that goes Up hills of bough and brier. This hooked thorn caught her gown and seemed Imploring her to linger; Upon her hair a sun-ray streamed Like some baptizing finger. This false-foxglove, so golden now With yellow blooms, like bangles, Was bloomless then. But yonder bough,â The sumac's plume entangles,â Was like an Indian's painted face; And, like a squaw, attended That bush, in vague vermilion grace, With beads of berries splendid. And here we turned to mount that hill, Down which the wild brook tumbles; And, like to-day, that day was still, And mild winds swayed the umbels Of these wild-carrots, lawny gray: And there, deep-dappled o'er us, An orchard stretched; and in our way Dropped ripened fruit before us. With muffled thud the pippin fell, And at our feet rolled dusty; A hornet clinging to its bell, The pear lay bruised and rusty: The smell of pulpy peach and plum, From which the juice oozed yellow,â Around which bees made sleepy hum,â Made warm the air and mellow. And then we came where, many-hued, The wet wild morning-glory Hung its balloons in shadows dewed For dawning's offertory: With bush and bramble, far away, Beneath us stretched the valley, Cleft of one creek, as clear as day, That rippled musically. The brown, the bronze, the green, the red Of weed and brier ran riot To walls of woods, whose pathways led To nooks of whispering quiet: Long waves of feathering goldenrod Ran through the gray in patches, As in a cloud the gold of God Burns, that the sunset catches. And there, above the blue hills rolled, Like some far conflagration, The sunset, flaming marigold, We watched in exultation: Then, turning homeward, she and I Went in love's sweet derangementâ How different now seem earth and sky, Since this undreamed estrangement. III He enters the woods. He sits down despondently: Here where the day is dimmest, And silence company, Some might find sympathy For loss, or grief the grimmest, In each great-hearted treeâ Here where the day is dimmestâ But, ah, there 's none for me! In leaves might find communion, Returning sigh for sigh, For love the heavens deny; The love that yearns for union, Yet parts and knows not why.â In leaves might find communionâ But, ah, not I, not I! My eyes with tears are aching.â Why has she written me? And will no longer see?â My heart with grief is breaking, With grief that this should be.â My eyes with tears are achingâ Why has she written me? IV He proceeds in the direction of a stream: Better is death than sleep, Better for tired eyes.â Why do we weep and weep When near us the solace lies? There, in that stream, that, deep,â Reflecting woods and skies,â Could comfort all our sighs. The mystery of things, Of dreams, philosophies, To which the mortal clings, That can unriddle these.â What is 't the water sings? What is 't it promises?â End to my miseries! V He seats himself on a rock and gazes steadily into the stream: And here alone I sit and it is so!â O vales and hills! O valley-lands and knobs! What cure have you for woe? What balm that robs The brain of thought, the knowledge of its woe? None! none! ah me! that my sick heart may know!â The wearying sameness!âyet this thing is so! This thing is so, and still the waters flow, The leaves drop slowly down; the daylight throbs With sun and wind, and yet this thing is so! There is no sympathy in heaven or earth For human sorrow! all we see is mirth, Or madness; cruelty or lust; Nature is heedless of her children's grief; Man is to her no more than is a leaf, That buds and has its summer, that is brief, Then falls, and mixes with the common dust. Here, at this culvert's mouth, The shadowy water, flowing toward the south, Seems deepest, stagnant-stayed.â What is it yonder that makes me afraid? Of my own self afraid?âI do not know!â What power draws me to the striate stream? What evil? or what dream? Me! dropping pebbles in the quiet wave, That echoes, strange as music in a cave, Hollow and thin; vibrating in the shade, As if 't were tears that fell, and, falling, made A crystal sound, a shadow wail of woe, Wrung from the rocks and waters there below; An ailing phantom that will not be laid; Complaining ghosts of sobs that fill my breast,â That will not forth,âand give my heart no rest. There, in the water, how the lank sword-grass Mats its long blades, each blade a crooked kris, Making a marsh; 'mid which the currents miss Their rock-born melodies. But there and there, one sees The wide-belled mallow, as within a glass, Long-pistiled, leaning o'er The root-contorted shore, As if its own pink image it would kiss. And there the tangled wild-potato vine Lifts beakered blossoms, each a cup of wine, As pale as moonlight is:â No mandrake, curling convolutions up, Loops heavier blossoms, each a conical cup That swoons moon-nectar and a serpent's hiss.â And there tall gipsy lilies, all a-sway, Of coppery hue Streaked as with crimson dew, Mirror fierce faces in the deeps, O'er which they lean, bent in inverted view.â And where the stream around those rushes creeps, The dragon-fly, in endless error, keeps Sewing the pale-gold gown of day With tangled stitches of a burning blue: Its brilliant body is a needle fine, A thread of azure ray, Black-pinioned, shuttling the shade and shine. But here before me where my pensive shade Looks up at me, the stale stream, stagnant, lies, Deep, dark, but clear and silent; streaked with hues Of ragweed pollen, and of spawny ooze, Through which the seeping bubbles, bursting, rise.â All flowers here refuse To grow or blossom; beauties, too, are few, That haunt its depths: no glittering minnows braid Its sleepy crystal; and no gravels strew With colored orbs its bottom. Half afraid I shrink from my own eyes There in its cairngorm of reflected skies.â I know not why, and yet it seems I seeâ What is 't I see there moving stealthily? I know not what!âBut where the kildees wade, Slim in the foamy scum, From that direction hither doth it come, Whate'er it is, that makes my soul afraid. Nearer it draws to where those low rocks ail, Warm rocks, on which some water-snake hath clomb, Basking its spotted body, coiling numb, Brown in the brindled shade.â At first it seemed a prism on the grail, A bubble's prism, like the shadow made Of water-striders; then a trail, An angled sparkle in a webby veil Of duckweed, green as verdigris, it swayed Frog-like through deeps, to crouch, a flaccid, pale, Squat bulk below. ... I gaze, and though I would, I can not go. Reflected trees and skies, And breeze-blown clouds that lounge at sunny loss, Seem in its stolid eyes, Its fishy gaze, that holds me in strange wise. Ghoul-like it seems to rise, And now to sink; its eldritch features fail, Then come again in rhythmic waviness, With arms like tentacles that seem to press Thro' weed and water: limbs that writhe and fade, And clench, and twist, and toss, Root-like and gnarled, and cross and inter-cross Through flabby hair of smoky moss. How horrible to see this thing at night! Or when the sunset slants its brimstone light Above the pool! when, blue, in phantom flight, The will-o'-the-wisps, perhaps, above it reel. Then, haply, would it rise, a rotting green, Up, up, and gather me with arms of steel, Soft steel, and drag me where the wave is white, Beneath that boulder brown, that plants a keel Against the ripple there, a shoulder lean.â No, no! I must away before 't is night! Before the fireflies dot The dark with sulphur blurrings bright! Before, upon that height, The white wild-carrots vanish from the sight; And boneset blossoms, tossing there in clusters, Fade to a ridge, a streak of ghostly lustres: And, in that sunlit spot, Yon cedar tree is not! But a huge cap instead, that, half-asleep, Some giant dropped while driving home his sheep: And 'mid those fallow browns And russet grays, the fragrant peak Of yonder timothy stack, Is not a stack, but something hideous, black, That threatens and, grotesquely demon, frowns. I must away from here.â Already dusk draws near. The owlet's dolorous hoot Sounds quavering as a gnome's wild flute; The toad, within the wet, Begins to tune its goblin flageolet: The slow sun sinks behind Those hills; and, like a withered cheek Of Quaker quiet, sorrow-burdened, there The spectral moon 's defined Above those trees,âas in a wild-beast's lair A golden woman, dead, with golden hair,â Above that mass of fox-grape vines That, like a wrecked appentice, roofs those pines.â Oh, I am faint and weak.â I must away, away! Before the close of day!â Already at my back I feel the woods grow black; And sense the evening wind, Guttural and gaunt and blind, Whining behind me like an unseen wolf. Deeper now seems the gulf Into whose deeps I gaze; From which, with madness and amaze, That seems to rise, the horror there, With webby hands and mossy eyes and hair.â Oh, will it pierce, With all its feelers fierce, Beyond the pool's unhallowed water-streak?â Yes; I must go, must go! Must leave this ghastly creek, This place of hideous fear! For everywhere I hear A dripping footstep near, A voice, like water, gurgling at my ear, Saying, âCome to me! come and rest below! Sleep and forget her and with her thy woe!ââ I try to fly.âI can not.âYes, and no!â What madness holds me!âGod! that obscene, slow, Sure mastering chimera there, Perhaps, has fastened round my neck, Or in my matted hair, Some horrible feeler, dire, invisible!â Off, off! thou hoop of Hell! Thou devil's coil! ... Back, back into thy cesspool! Off of me!â See, how the waters thrash and boil! At last! at last! thank God! my soul is free! My mind is freed of that vile mesmerism That drew me toâwhat end? my God! what end? Haply 'twas merely fancy, that strange fiend: My fancy, and a prism Of sunset in the stream, a firefly fleck, That now, a lamp of golden fairy oil, Lights me my homeward way, the way I flee. No more I stare, magnetic-fixed; nor reck, Nor little care to foil The madness there! the murder there! that slips Back to its lair of slime, that seeps and drips, That sought in vain to fasten on my lips. VI Taking a letter from his pocket, he hurries away: What can it mean for me? what have I done to her? I, in our season of love as a sun to her: She, all my heaven of silvery, numberless Stars and its moon, shining golden and slumberless; Who on my life, that was thorny and lowery, Cameâand made beautiful; smiledâand made flowery. She, to my heart and my soul a divinity! She, whoâI dreamed!âseemed my spirit-affinity!â What have I done to her? what have I done? What can she mean by this?âwhat have I said to her? I, who have idolized, worshiped, and pled to her; Sung with her, laughed with her, sorrowed and sighed for her; Lived for her only; and gladly had died for her! See! she has written me thus! she has written meâ Sooner would dagger or serpent had smitten me!â Would you had shriveled ere ever you 'd read of it, Eyes, that are wide to the grief and the dread of it!â What have I said to her? what have I said? What shall I make of it? I who am trembling, Fearful of losing.âA moth, the dissembling Flame of a taper attracts with its guttering, Flattering on till its body lies fluttering, Scorched in the summer night.âFoolish, importunate, Why didst thou quit the cool flowers, unfortunate!â Such has she been to me, making me such to her!â Slaying me, saying I never was much to her!â What shall I make of it? what can I make? Love, in thy everglades, moaning and motionless, Look, I have fallen; the evil is potionless: I, with no thought but the day that did lock us in, Set naked feet 'mid the cottonmouth-moccasin, Under the roses, the Cherokee, eying me:â I,âin the heav'n with the egrets that, flying me, Winging like blooms from magnolias, rose slenderly, Pearl and pale pink: where the mocking-bird tenderly Sang, making vistas of mosses melodious, Wandered,âunheeding my steps,âin the odious Ooze and the venom. I followed the wiry Violet curve of thy star falling fieryâ So was I lost in night! thus am undone! Have I not told to herâliving alone for herâ Purposed unfoldments of deeds I had sown for her Here in the soil of my soul? their variety Endlessâand ever she answered with piety. See! it has come to thisâall the tale's suavity At the ninth chapter grows hateful with gravity; Cruel as death all our beautiful historyâ Close it!âthe final is more than a mystery.â Yes; I will go to her; yes; and will speak. VII After the final meeting; the day following: I seem to see her still; to see That blue-hung room. Her perfume comes From lavender folds, draped dreamily,â A-blossom with brocaded blooms,â Some stuff of orient looms. I seem to hear her speak; and back, Where sleeps the sun on books and piles Of porcelain and bric-Ã -brac, A tall clock ticks above the tiles, Where Love's framed profile smiles. I hear her say, âAh, had I known!â I suffer too for what has beenâ For what must be.ââA wild ache shone In her sad gaze that seemed to lean On something far, unseen. And as in sleep my own self seems Outside my suffering self.âI flush 'Twixt facts and undetermined dreams, And stand, as silent as that hush Of lilac light and plush. Smiling, but suffering, I feel, Beneath that face, so sweet and sad, In those pale temples, thoughts, like steel, Pierce burningly. ... I had gone mad Had I once thought her glad.â Unconsciously, with eyes that yearn To look beyond the present far, For one faint future hope, I turnâ There, in her garden, one fierce star, A cactus, red as war, Vermilion as a storm-sunk sun, Flames torrid splendor,âbrings to life A sunset; memory of one Rich eve she said she 'd be my wife; An eve with beauty rife. Again amid the heavy hues, Soft crimson, seal, and satiny gold Of flowers there, I stood 'mid dews With her; deep in her garden old, While sunset's flame unrolled. And now! ... It can not be! and yet To see 'tis so!âIn heart and brain To know 'tis so!âWhile, warm and wet, I seem to smell those scents again, Verbena scents and rain. I turn, in hope she'll bid me stay. Again her cameo beauty mark Set in that smile.âShe turns away. No farewell! no regret! no spark Of hope to cheer the dark! That sepia sketchâconceive it soâ A jaunty head with mouth and eyes Tragic beneath a rose-chapeau, Silk-masked, unmaskingâit denies The look we half surmise, We know is there. 'Tis thus we read The true beneath the false; perceive The ache beneath the smile.âIndeed! Whose soul unmasks? ... Not mine!âI grieve,â Oh God!âbut laugh and leave. ... VIII He walks aimlessly on: Beyond those knotted apple-trees, That partly hide the old brick barn, Its tattered arms and tattered knees A scarecrow tosses to the breeze Among the shocks of corn. My heart is gray as is the day, In which the rain-wind drearily Makes all the rusty branches sway, And in the hollows, by each way, The dead leaves rustle wearily. And soon we'll hear the far wild-geese Honk in frost-bitten heavens under Arcturus; when my walks must cease, And by the fireside's log-heaped peace I'll sit and nod and ponder.â When every fall of this loud creek Is silent with the frost; and tented Brown acres of the corn stretch bleak And shaggy with the snows, that streak The hillsides, hollow-dented; I'll sit and dream of that glad morn We met by banks with elder snowing; That dusk we strolled through flower and thorn, By tasseled meads of cane and corn, To where the stream was flowing. Again I'll oar our boat among The dripping lilies of the river, To reach her hat, the grape-vine long Struck in the stream; we'll row to song; And then ... I'll wake and shiver. Why is it that my mind reverts To that sweet past? while full of parting The present is: so full of hurts And heartache, that what it asserts Adds only to the smarting. How often shall I sit and think Of that sweet past! through lowered lashes What-might-have-been trace link by link; Then watch it gradually sink And crumble into ashes. Outside I'll hear the sad wind weep Like some lone spirit, grieved, forsaken; Then, shuddering, to bed will creep, To lie awake, or, haply, sleep A sleep by visions shaken. By visions of the past, that draw The present in a hue that 's wanting; A scarecrow thing of sticks and straw,â Like that just now I, passing, saw,â Its empty tatters flaunting. IX He compares the present day with a past one: The sun a splintered splendor was In trees, whose waving branches blurred Its disc, that day we went together, 'Mid wild-bee hum and whirring buzz Of locusts, through the fields that purred With summer in the perfect weather. So sweet it was to look, and lean To her young face and feel the light Of eyes that met my own unsaddened! Her laugh that left lips more serene; Her speech that blossomed like the white Life-everlasting there and gladdened. Maturing summer, you were fraught With more of beauty then than now Parades the pageant of September: Where What-is-now contrasts in thought With What-was-once, that bloom and bough Can only help me to remember. X He pauses before a deserted house by the wayside: Through ironweeds and roses And scraggy beech and oak, Old porches it discloses Above the weeds and roses The drizzling raindrops soak. Neglected walks a-tangle With dodder-strangled grass; And every mildewed angle Heaped with dead leaves that spangle. The paths that round it pass. The creatures there that bury Or hide within its rooms And spidered closetsâvery Dim with old websâwill hurry Out when the evening glooms. Owls roost on beam and basement; Bats haunt its hearth and porch; And, by each ruined casement, Flits, in the moon's enlacement, The wisp, like some wild torch. There is a sense of frost here, And winds that sigh alway Of something that was lost here, Long, long ago was lost here, But what, they can not say. My foot, perhaps, would startle Some owl that mopes within; Some bat above its portal, That frights the daring mortal, And guards its cellared sin. The creaking road winds by it This side the dusty toll.â Why do I stop to eye it? My heart can not deny itâ The house is like my soul. XI He proceeds on his way: I bear a burdenâlook not therein! Naught will you find save sorrow and sin; Sorrow and sin that wend with me Wherever I go. And misery, A gaunt companion, my wretched bride, Goes ever with me, side by side. Sick of myself and all the earth, I ask my soul now: Is life worth The little pleasure that we gain For all our sorrow and our pain? The love, to which we gave our best, That turns a mockery and a jest? XII Among the twilight fields: The things we love, the loveliest things we cherish, Pass from us soonest, vanish utterly. Dust are our deeds, and dust our dreams that perish Ere we can say They be! I have loved man and learned we are not brothersâ Within myself, perhaps, may lie the cause;â Then set one woman high above all others, And found her full of flaws. Made unseen stars my keblahs of devotion; Aspired to knowledge, and remained a clod: With heart and soul, led on by blind emotion, The way to failure trod. Chance, say, or fate, that works through good and evil; Or destiny, that nothing may retard, That to some end, above life's empty level, Perhaps withholds reward. PART IV LATE AUTUMN They who die young are blest.â Should we not envy such?â They are Earth's happiest, God-loved and favored much!â They who die young are blest. I Sick and sad, propped with pillows, she sits at her window: When the dog's-tooth violet comes With April showers, And the wild-bee haunts and hums About the flowers, We shall never wend as when Love laughed leading us from men Over violet vale and glen, Where the red-bird sang for hours, And we heard the flicker drum. Now November heavens are gray: Autumn kills Every joyâlike leaves of May In the rills.â Here I sit and lean and listen To a voice that has arisen In my heart; with eyes that glisten Gazing at the happy hills, Fading dark blue, far away. II She looks down upon the dying garden: There rank death clutches at the flowers And drags them down and stamps in earth. At morn the thin, malignant hours, Shrill-voiced, among the wind-torn bowers, Clamor a bitter mirthâ Or is it heartbreak that, forlorn, Would so conceal itself in scorn. At noon the weak, white sunlight crawls, Like feeble age, once beautiful, From mildewed walks to mildewed walls, Down which the oozing moisture falls Upon the cold toadstool:â Faint on the leaves it drips and creepsâ Or is it tears of love who weeps? At night a misty blur of moon Slips through the trees,âpale as a face Of melancholy marble hewn;â And, like the phantom of some tune, Winds whisper in the placeâ Or is it love come back again, Seeking its perished joy in vain? III She muses upon the past: When, in her cloudy chiton, Spring freed the frozen rills, And walked in rainbowed light on The blossom-blowing hills; Beyond the world's horizon, That no such glory lies on, And no such hues bedizen, Love led us far from ills. When Summer came, a sickle Stuck in her sheaf of beams, And let the honey trickle From out her bee-hives' seams; Within the violet-blotted Sweet book to us allotted,â Whose lines are flower-dotted,â Love read us many dreams. Then Autumn came,âa liar, A fair-faced heretic;â In gypsy garb of fire, Throned on a harvest rick.â Our lives, that fate had thwarted, Stood pale and broken-hearted,â Though smiling when we parted,â Where love to death lay sick. Now is the Winter waited, The tyrant hoar and old, With death and hunger mated, Who counts his crimes like gold.â Once more, before forever We partâonce more, then never!â Once more before we sever, Must I his face behold! IVShe takes up a book and reads: What little things are those That hold our happiness! A smile, a glance; a rose Dropped from her hair or dress; A word, a look, a touch,â These are so much, so much. An air we can't forget; A sunset's gold that gleams; A spray of mignonette, Will fill the soul with dreams, More than all history says, Or romance of old days. For, of the human heart, Not brain, is memory; These things it makes a part Of its own entity; The joys, the pains whereof Are the very food of love. VShe lays down the book, and sits musing: How true! how true!âbut words are weak, In sympathy they give the soul, To musicâmusic, that can speak All the heart's pain and dole; All that the sad heart treasures most Of love that 's lost, of love that 's lost.â I would not hear sweet music now. My heart would break to hear it now. So weary am I, and so fain To see his face, to feel his kiss Thrill rapture through my soul again!â There is no hell like this!â Ah, God! my God, were it not best To give me rest, to give me rest!â Come, death, and breathe upon my brow. Sweet death, come kiss my mouth and brow. VIShe writes to her lover to come to her: Dead lie the dreams we cherished, The dreams we loved so well; Like forest leaves they perished, Like autumn leaves they fell. Alas! that dreams so soon should pass! Alas! alas! The stream lies bleak and arid, That once went singing on; The flowers once that varied Its banks are dead and gone: Where these were once are thorns and thirstâ The place is curst. Come to me. I am lonely. Forget all that occurred. Come to me; if for only One last, sad, parting word: For one last word. Then let the pall Fall over all. The day and hour are suited For what I 'd say to you Of love that I uprooted.â But I have suffered, too!â Come to me; I would say good-by Before I die. VII The wind rises; the trees are agitated: Woods that beat the wind with frantic Gestures and sow darkly round Acorns gnarled and leaves that antic Wildly on the rustling ground, Is it tragic grief that saddens Through your souls this autumn day? Or the joy of death that gladdens In exultance of decay? Arrogant you lift defiant Boughs against the moaning blast, That, like some invisible giant, Wrapped in tumult, thunders past. Is it that in such insurgent Fury, tossed from tree to tree, You would quench the fiercely urgent Pangs of some old memory? As in toil and violent action, That still help them to forget, Mortals drown the dark distraction And insistence of regret. VIIIShe sits musing in the gathering twilight: Last night I slept till midnight; then woke, and, far away, A cock crowed; lonely and distant I heard a watch-dog bay: But lonelier yet the tedious old clock ticked on to'ards day. And what a day!âremember those morns of summer and spring, That bound our lives together! each morn a wedding-ring Of dew, aroma, and sparkle, and buds and birds a-wing. Clear morns, when I strolled my garden, awaiting him, the rose Expected too, with blushes,âthe Giant-of-battle that grows A bank of radiance and fragrance, and the MarÃ©chal-Niel that glows. Not in vain did I wait, departed summer, amid your phlox! 'Mid the powdery crystal and crimson of your hollow hollyhocks; Your fairy-bells and poppies, and the bee that in them rocks. Cool-clad 'mid the pendulous purple of the morning-glory vine, By the jewel-mine of the pansies and the snap-dragons in line, I waited, and there he met me whose heart was one with mine. Around us bloomed my mealy-white dusty-millers gay, My lady-slippers, bashful of butterfly and ray; My gillyflowers, spicy, each one, as a day of May. Ah me! when I think of the handfuls of little gold coins, amass, My bachelor's-buttons scattered over the garden grass, The marigolds that boasted their bits of burning brass; More bitter I feel the autumn tighten on spirit and heart; And regret those days, remembered as lost, that stand apart, A chapter holy and sacred, I read with eyes that smart. How warm was the breath of the garden when he met me there that day! How the burnished beetle and humming-bird flew past us, each a ray!â The memory of those meetings still bears me far away: Again to the woods a-trysting by the water-mill I steal, Where the lilies tumble together, the madcap wind at heel; And meet him among the flowers, the rocks and the moss conceal: Or the wild-cat gray of the meadows that the black-eyed Susans dot, Fawn-eyed and leopard-yellow, that tangle a tawny spot Of languid panther beauty that dozes, summer-hot. ... Ah! back again in the present! with the winds that pinch and twist The leaves in their peevish passion, and whirl wherever they list; With the autumn, hoary and nipping, whose mausolean mist Entombs the sun and the daylight: each morning shaggy with fog, That fits gray wigs on the cedars, and furs with frost each log; That velvets white the meadows, and marbles brook and bog.â Alone at dawnâindifferent: alone at eveâI sigh: And wait, like the wind complaining: complain and know not why: But ailing and longing and pining because I can not die. How dull is that sunset! dreary and cold, and hard and dead! The ghost of those last August that, mulberry-rich and red, The wine of God's own vintage, poured purple overhead. But now I sit with the sighing dead dreams of a dying year; Like the fallen leaves and the acorns, am worthless and feel as sere, With a soul that 's sick of the body, whose heart is one big tear. As I stare from my window the daylight, like a bravo, its cloak puts on. The moon, like a cautious lanthorn, glitters, and then is gone.â Will he come to-night? will he answer?âAh, God! would it were dawn! IXHe enters. Taking her in his arms he speaks: They said you were dying.â You shall not die! ... Why are you crying? Why do you sigh?â Cease that sad sighing!â Love, it is I. All is forgiven!â Love is not poor; Though he was driven Once from your door, Back he has striven, To part nevermore! Will you remember When I forget Words, each an ember, That you regret, Now in November, Now we have met? What if love wept once! What though you knew! What if he crept once Pleading to you!â He never slept once, Nor was untrue. Often forgetful, Love may forget; Froward and fretful, Dear, he will fret; Ever regretful, He will regret. Life is completer Through his control; Lifted, made sweeter, Filled and made whole, Hearing love's metre Sing in the soul. Flesh may not hear it, Being impure; But in the spirit, There we are sure; There we come near it, There we endure. So when to-morrow Ceases and we Quit this we borrow, Mortality, What chastens sorrow So it may see?â (When friends are sighing Round one, and one Nearer is lying, Nearer the sun, When one is dying And all is done? When there is weeping, Weary and deep,â God's be the keeping Of those who weep!â When our loved, sleeping, Sleep their long sleep?â) Love! that is dearer Than we 're aware; Bringing us nearer, Nearer than prayer; Being the mirror That our souls share. Still you are weeping! Why do you weep?â Are tears in keeping With joy so deep? Gladness so sweeping? Hearts so in keep? Speak to me, dearest! Say it is true! That I am nearest, Dearest to you.â Smile, with those clearest Eyes of gray blue. XShe smiles on him through her tears; holding his hand she speaks: They did not say I could not live beyond this weary night, But now I know that I shall die before the morning's light. How weak I am!âbut you'll forgive me when I tell you how I loved youâlove you; and the pain it is to leave you now? We could not wed!âAlas! the flesh, that clothes the soul of me, Ordained at birth a sacrifice to this heredity, Denied, forbade.âAh, you have seen the bright spots in my cheeks Glow hectic, as before comes night the west burns blood-red streaks? Consumption.ââBut I promised you my hand?ââa thing forlorn Of life; diseased!âO God!âand so, far better so, forsworn!â Oh, I was jealous of your love. But think: if I had died Ere babe of mine had come to be a solace at your side! Had it been little thenâyour grief, when Heaven had made us one In everything that 's good on earth and then the good undone? No! no! and had I had a childâwhat grief and agony To know that blight born in him, too, against all help of me! Just when we cherished him the most, and youthful, sunny pride Sat on his curly front, to see him die ere we had died.â Whose fault?âAh, God!ânot mine! but his, that ancestor who gave Escutcheon to our sorrowful house, a Death's-head and a Grave. Beneath the pomp of those grim arms we live and may not move; Nor faith, nor truth, nor wealth avail to hurl them down, nor love! How could I tell you this?ânot then! when all the world was spun Of morning colors for our love to walk and dance upon. I could not tell you how disease hid here a viper germ, Precedence slowly claiming and so slowly fixing firm. And when I broke my plighted troth and would not tell you why, I loved you, thinking, âtime enough when I have come to die.â Draw off my rings and let my hands rest so ... the wretched cough Will interrupt my feeble speech and will not be put off ... Ah, anyhow, my anodyne is this: to know that you Are near and love me!âKiss me now, as you were wont to do. And tell me you forgive me all; and say you will forget The sorrow of that breaking-off, the fever and the fret.â Now set those roses near me here, and tell me death 's a lieâ Once it was hard for me to live ... now it is hard to die. PART V WINTER We, whom God sets a task, Striving, who ne'er attain, We are the curst!âwho ask Death, and still ask in vain. We, whom God sets a task. I In the silence of his room. After many days: All, all are shadows. All must pass As writing in the sand or sea: Reflections in a looking-glass Are not less permanent than we. The days that mold usâwhat are they? That break us on their whirling wheel? What but the potters! we the clay They fashion and yet leave unreal. Linked through the ages, one and all, In long anthropomorphous chain, The human and the animal Inseparably must remain. Within us still the monstrous shape That shrieked in air and howled in slime, What are we?âpartly man and apeâ The tools of fate, the toys of time! II The bitterness of his bereavement speaks in him: Vased in her bedroom window, white As her glad girlhood, never lost, I smelt the rosesâand the night Outside was fog and frost. What though I claimed her dying there! God nor one angel understood Nor cared, who from sweet feet to hair Had changed to snow her blood. She had been mine so long, so long! Our harp of life was one in wordâ Why did death thrust his hand among The chords and break one chord! What lily lilier than her face! More virgin than her lips I kissed! When morn, like God, with gold and grace, Broke massed in mist! broke massed in mist! III Her dead face seems to rise up before him: The face that I said farewell to, Pillowed a flower on flowers, Comes back, with its eyes to tell to My soul what my heart should quell to Calm, that is mine at hours. Dear, is your soul still daggered There by something amiss? Loveâis he ever laggard? Hopeâis her face still haggard? Tell me what it is! You, who are done with to-morrow! Done with these worldly skies! Done with our pain and sorrow! Done with the griefs we borrow! Joys that are born of sighs! Must we say âgone forever?â Or will it all come true? Does mine touch your thought ever? And, over the doubts that sever, Rise to the fact that 's you? Love, in my flesh so fearful, Medicine me this pain!â Love, with the eyes so tearful, How can my soul be cheerful, Seeing its joy is slain! ... Gone!â't was only a vision!â Gone! like a thought, a gleam!â Such to our indecision Utter no empty mission;â Truth is in all we dream! IVHe sinks into deep thought: There are shadows that compel us, There are powers that control: More than substance these can tell us, Speaking to the human soul. In the moonlight, when it glistened On my window, white of glow, Once I woke and, leaning, listened To a voice that sang below. Full of gladness, full of yearning, Strange with dreamy melody, Like a bird whose heart was burning, Wildly sweet it sang to me. I arose; and by the starlight, Pale beneath the summer sky, There I saw it, full of far light,â My dead joy go singing by. In the darkness, when the glimmer Of the storm was on the pane, Once I sat and heard a dimmer Voice lamenting in the rain. Full of parting and unspoken Heartbreak, faint with agony, Like a bird whose heart was broken, Moaning low it cried to me. I arose; and in the darkness, Wan beneath the winter sky, There I saw it, cold to starkness,â My dead love go wailing by. VHe arouses from his abstraction, buries his face in his hands and thinks: So long it seems since last I saw her face, So long ago it seems, Like some sad soul in unconjectured space, Still seeking happiness through perished grace And unrealities, a little while Illusions lead me, ending in the smile Of Death, triumphant in a thorny place, Among Love's ruined roses and dead dreams. Since she is gone, no more I feel the light,â Since she has left all dark,â Cleave, with its revelation, all the night. I wander blindly, on a crumbling height, Among the fragments and the wrecks and stones Of Life, where Hope, amid Life's skulls and bones, With weary face, disheartened, wild and white, Trims her pale lamp with its expiring spark. Now she is dead, the Soul, naught can o'erawe,â Now she is gone from me,â Questions God's justice that seems full of flaw, As is His world, where misery is law, And all men fools, too willing to be slaves.â My House of Faith, built up on dust of graves, The wind of doubt sweeps down as made of straw, And all is night and I no longer see. VIHe looks from his window toward the sombre west: Ridged and bleak the gray, forsaken Twilight at the night has guessed; And no star of dusk has taken Flame unshaken in the west. All day long the woodlands, dying, Moaned, and drippings as of grief Rained from barren boughs with sighing Death of flying twig and leaf. Ah, to live a life unbroken Of the flings and scorns of fate! Like that tree, with branches oaken, Strength's unspoken intimate.â Who can say that we have never Lived the life of plants and trees?â Not so wide the lines that sever Us forever here from these. Colors, odors, that are cherished, Haply hint we once were flowers: Memory alone has perished In this garnished world that's ours. Music,âthat all things expresses, All for which we 've sought and sinned,â Haply in our treey tresses Once was guesses of the wind. But I dream!âThe dusk, dark braiding Locks that lack both moon and star, Deepens; and, the darkness aiding, Earth seems fading, faint and far. And within me doubt keeps sayingâ âWhat is wrong, and what is right? Hear the cursing! hear the praying! All are straying on in night.â VIIHe turns from the window, takes up a book, and reads: The soul, like Earth, hath silences Which speak not, yet are heard: The voices mute of memories Are louder than a word. Theirs is a speech which is not speech; A language that is bound To soul-vibrations, vague, that reach Deeper than any sound. No words are theirs. They speak through things, A visible utterance Of thoughtsâlike those some sunset brings, Or withered rose, perchance. The heavens that once, in purple and flame, Spake to two hearts as one, In after years may speak the same To one sad heart alone. Through it the vanished face and eyes Of her, the sweet and fair, Of her the lost, again shall rise To comfort his despair. And so the love that led him long From golden scene to scene, Within the sunset is a tongue That speaks of what has been.â How loud it speaks of that dead day, The rose whose bloom is fled! Of her who died; who, clasped in clay, Lies numbered with the dead. The dead are dead; with them 't is well Within their narrow room;â No memories haunt their hearts who dwell Within the grave and tomb. But what of thoseâthe dead who live! The living dead, whose lot Is still to loveâah, God forgive!â To live and love, forgot! VIII The storm is heard sounding wildly outside with wind and hail: The night is wild with rain and sleet; Each loose-warped casement claps or groans: I hear the plangent woodland beat The tempest with long blatant moans, Like one who fears defeat. And sitting here beyond the storm, Alone within the lonely house, It seems that some mesmeric charm Holds all thingsâeven the gnawing mouse Has ceased its faint alarm. And in the silence, stolen o'er Familiar objects, lo, I fearâ I fearâthat, opening yon door, I'll find my dead self standing near, With face that once I wore. The stairway creaks with ghostly gusts: The flue moans; all its gorgon throat One wail of winds: ancestral dusts,â Which yonder Indian war-gear coat With gray, whose quiver rusts,â Are shaken down.âOr, can it be, That he who wore it in the dance, Or battle, now fills shadowy Its wampumed skins? and shakes his lance And spectral plume at me?â Mere fancy!âYet those curtains toss Mysteriously as if some dark Hand moved them.âAnd I would not cross The shadow there, that hearthstone's spark, A glow-worm sunk in moss. Outside 't were better!âYes, I yearn To walk the waste where sway and dip Deep, dark December boughsâwhere burn Some late last leaves, that drip and drip No matter where you turn. Where sodden soil, you scarce have trod, Fills oozy footprintsâbut the blind Night there, though like the frown of God, Presents no fancies to the mind, Like those that have o'erawed.â The months I count: how long it seems Since summer! summer, when with her, When on her porch, in rainy gleams We watched the flickering lightning stir In heavens gray as dreams. When all the west, a sheet of gold, Flared,âlike some Titan's opened forge,â With storm; revealing, manifold, Vast peaks of clouds with crag and gorge, Where thunder-torrents rolled. Then came the wind: again, again Storm lit the instant earthâand how The forest rang with roaring rain!â We could not readâwhere is it now?â That tale of Charlemagne: That old romance! that tale, which we Were reading; till we heard the plunge Of distant thunder sullenly, And left to watch the lightning lunge, And storm-winds toss each tree. That summer!âHow it built us there, Of sorcery and necromance, A mental-world, where all was fair; A land like one great pearl, a-trance With lilied light and air. Where every flower was a thought; And every bird, a melody; And every fragrance, zephyr brought, Was but the rainbowed drapery Of some sweet dream long sought. 'Mid which we reared our heart's high home, Fair on the hills; with terraces, Vine-hung and wooded, o'er the foam Of undiscovered fairy seas, All violet in the gloam. O land of shadows! shadow-home, Within my world of memories! Around whose ruins sweeps the foam Of sorrow's immemorial seas, To whose dark shores I come! How long in your wrecked halls, alone With ghosts of joys must I remain? Between the unknown and the known, Still hearing through the wind and rain My lost love moan and moan. IXHe sits by the slowly dying fire. The storm is heard with increased violence: Wild weather. The lash of the sleet On the gusty casement, clappingâ The sound of the storm like a sheet My soul and senses wrapping. Wild weather. And how is she, Now the rush of the rain falls serried There on the turf and the tree Of the place where she is buried? Wild weather. How black and deep Is the night where the mad winds scurry!â Do I sleep? do I dream in my sleep That I hear her footsteps hurry? Hither they come like flowersâ And I see her raiment glisten, Like the robes of one of the hours Where the stars to the angels listen. Before me, behold, how she stands! With lips high thoughts have weighted, With testifying hands, And eyes with glory sated. I have spoken and I have kneeled: I have kissed her feet in wonderâ But, lo! her lipsâthey are sealed, God-sealed, and will not sunder. Though I sob, âYour stay was long! You are come,âbut your feet were laggard!â With mansuetude and song For the heart your death has daggered.â Never a word replies, Never, to all my weepingâ Only a sound of sighs, And of raiment past me sweeping. ... I wake; and a clock tolls threeâ And the night and the storm beat serried There on the turf and the tree Of the place where she is buried. RED LEAVES AND ROSES I And he had lived such loveless years That suffering had made him wise; And she had known no graver tears Than those of girlhood's eyes. And he, perhaps, had loved beforeâ One, who had wedded, or had died;â So life to him had been but poor In love for which he sighed. In years and heart she was so young Love paused and beckoned at the gate, And bade her hear his songs, unsung; She laughed that âlove must wait.â He understood. She only knew Love's hair was faded, face was grayâ Nor saw the rose his autumn blew There in her heedless way. II If he had come to her when May Danced down the wildwood,âevery way Marked with white flow'rs, as if her gown Had torn and fallen,âit might be She had not met him with a frown, Nor used his love so bitterly. Or if he had but come when June Set stars and roses to one tune, And breathed in honeysuckle throats Clove-honey of her spicy mouth, His heart had found some loving notes In hers to cheer his life's long drouth. He came when Fall made mad the sky, And on the hills leapt like a cry Of battle; when his youth was dead; To her, the young, the wild, the white; Whose symbol was the rose, blood-red, And his the red leaf pinched with blight. He might have known, since youth was flown, And autumn claimed him for its own; And winter neared with snow, wild whirled, His love to her would seem absurd; To youth like hers; whose lip had curled Yet heard him to his last sad word. Then laughed andâwell, his heart denied The words he uttered then in pride; And he remembered how the gray Was his of autumn, ah! and hers, The rose-hued colors of the May, And May was all her universe. And then he left her: and, like blood, In her deep hair, the rose; whose bud Was badge to her: while unto him, His middle-age, must still remain The red-leaf, withering at the rim, As symbol of the all-in-vain. III âSuch days as these,â she said, and bent Among her marigolds, all dew, And dripping zinnia stems, âwere meant For spring not autumn; days we knew In childhood; these endearing those; Much dearer since they have grown old: Days, once imperfect with the rose, Now perfect with the marigold.â âSuch days as these,â he said, and gazed Long with unlifted eyes that held Sad autumn nights, âour hopes have raised In futures that are mist-enspelled. And so it is the fog blows in Days dearer for the death they paint With hues of life and joy,âas sin, At death, puts off all earthly taint.â IV Like deeds of hearts that have not kept Their riches, as a miser, when Sad souls have asked, with eyes that wept, Among the toiling tribes of men, The summer days gave Earth sweet alms In silver of white lilies, while Each night, with healing, outstretched palms Stood Christ-like with its starry smile. Will she remember him when dull Months drag their duller hours by? With feet that crush the beautiful And leave the beautiful to die? Or never see? nor sit with lost Dreams withered, 'mid hope's empty husks, And wait, heart-counting-up the cost Of love's illusions 'mid life's dusks? V He is as one who, treading salty scurf Of lonely sea-sands, hears the roaring rocks Of some lost isle of misty crags and lochs; Who sees no sea, but, through a world of surf, Gray ghosts of gulls and screaming petrel flocks: When, from the deep's white ruin and wild wreck, Above the fog, beneath the ghostly gull, The iron ribs of some storm-shattered hull Loom, packed with pirate treasure to the deck A century rotten: feels his wealth replete, When long-baulked ocean claims it; and one dull Wave flings, derisive at despondent feet, A skull, one doubloon rattling in the skull. VI And when full autumn sets the dahlia stems On fire with flowers, and the chill dew turns The maple trees, above geranium urns, To Emir tents, and strings with flawless gems The moon-flower and the wahoo-bush that burns; Calmly she sees the year grow sad and strange, And stands with one among the wilted walks Of the old garden of the gray, old grange, And feels no sorrow for the frost-maimed stalks Sinceâthough the wailing autumn to her talksâ Youth marks swift spring on life's far mountain-range. Or she will lean to her old harpsichord; A youthful face beside her; and the glow Of hickory on the hearth will balk the blow Of blustering rain that beats the casement hard; And sing of summer and so thwart the snow. âHaply, some day, she yet may sit alone,â He thinks, âwithin the shadow-saddened house, When round the gables stormy echoes moan, And in the closet gnaws the lonesome mouse; And Memory come stealing down the stair From dusty attics where is piled the Pastâ Like so much rubbish that we hate to keepâ And turn the knob; and, framed in frosty hair, A grave, forgotten face look in at last, And she will know, and bow her head and weep.â WILD THORN AND LILY I That night, returning to the farm, we rode Before a storm. Uprolling from the west, Incessant with distending fire, loomed The multitudes of tempest: towering here A shadowy Shasta, there a cloudy Hood, Veined as with agonies, aurora-born, Of torrent gold; resplendent heaven to heaven, Far peak to peak, terrific spoke; the vast Sierras of the storm, within which beat The caverned thunder like a mighty stream: Vibrating on, with rushing wind and flame, Now th' opening welkin shone, one livid sheet Of instantaneous gold, a giant's forge, Wild-clanging; now, with streak on angled streak Of momentary light, a labyrinth Where shouting Darkness stalked with Titan torch: Again the firmament hung hewn with fire Whence leapt the thunder; and it seemed that hosts Of Heaven rushed to war with blazing shields And swords of splendor. And before the storm We galloped, while the frantic trees above Went wild with rain, through whose mad limbs and leaves Splashed black the first big drops. On, on we drove, And gained the gates, pillaring the avenue Of ancient beech, at whose far, flickering end, At last, beaconed the lights of home. And she? Was it the lightning that lent lividness And terror to her countenance? or fear Of her own heart? revulsion? memory? Did deep regret, that, now the thing was done, That she was mine, a yearning to be free, Away from me, assail her? or, the thought, The knowledge, that she did not love the man Whom she had wedded? knowing better now That all her heart was Julien's from the first, And would be Julien's until the end. And did she now look backward on the past? Or forwardâon the barrier that the church For all the future years had placed between The possible and impossible? God knows! Yet I had won her honestly with words Love, only, uttered out of its soul's truth; Had won herâwas it openly?âperhaps!â Although engaged to Julien.âWhat else Had led us to elopement?âWell, 't was done! The whole, mad, lovely, miserable affair Of love and youthful folly. Being done We must abide the reckoning. That is, I would; and she?âshe saw her duty there Beside her husband. And within myself, When we alighted from the carriage, thus,â Beneath the porch,âmy mind resolved the thing: âI am her husband now, and she my wife. Less than her husband, I, much less a man, Were I not able to regain and keep The love she gave me, that she thinks is his, That is not his. 'T is pity merely now That makes her pensive. I am pensive, too, For Julien, the poet and the friend; The dreamer and the lover.âBut all 's fair In love they say; and I,âwell, willingly I'll bear the burthen of the blame of all.â Scarce had we entered when high heaven oped Vast gates of bronze and doors of booming brass That dammed a deluge, and the deluge poured.â I thought of him still; for I felt that she Was thinking too of Julien and his moods, That often swept his soul with storm like this, Yet oftener with sunlight than with storm; That soul of sun and tempest, ray and rain, My school-friend Julien! whom once she won To think she lovedâI know not how. My play Was open as the morning, and as fair. His poverty and genius here, and here My wealth andâplatitude; and I had won. But it was hard for him. I did not dream That it would end so. And when Gwendolyn Used every gentlenessâand that is muchâ I did not dream his poet's temperament Were so affected of a love affair, A wrong or right; he, whose sole aim seemed song. I did not dream he 'd take it desperately, And end so tragically. Who 'd have thought His character, although so sensitive, Would fall into extremes of morbidness And melancholy! Had it now been I, Whose heart had lost in the great game of love, None would have wondered; for I am of those Whose vigorous iron does not bend, but break At one decisive blow: his should have sprungâ Or so I think, not broken as it hadâ Elastic as fine-tempered steel that bends And then resumes its usual usefulness. A pale smile strained the corners of her mouth When, from the porch, into the parlor's blaze I led her. And her mother met us there, Her mother and her father. And I saw The slow reflection of their happiness Make glad her eyes, as their approval grew From half-severe rebukes, that were well meant, To open, glad avowal of their joy. She had done well, and we were soon forgiven. ... But I resumed his letter when alone: His letter written her three months before, When all was over, and we two were one, And well upon our way to Italy For six sweet months of honeymoon. His word, His letter, all of her, that came to me At Venice, that I opened in mistake, Amid a lot of papers sent from home. She had not read, and never should while I Had power to conceal until I 'd read. I would not let the dead scrawl mar or soil My late-won joy, my testament of love. No! I would read it, afterwards destroy. Thoughts made of music for a last farewell, When he knew all and asked her to perpend Expressions of past things her gift of love Had given speech to in the happy days. And so I read:â II âThe rhyme is mine, but yours The thought and all the music, springing from The rareness of the love that dawned on me A little while to make my sad life glad. Should I regret the sunset it refused, Since all my morn was richer than the world? Or that my day should stride without a change Of crimson, or of purple, or of gold, Into the barren blackness where the moon And all God's stars lay dead? Should I complain, Upbraid or censure or one moment curse, I with my morning? 'T is a memory That stains the midnight now: one wild-rose ray Laid like a finger pointing me the path I follow, and I go rejoicingly. Our love was very young (nor had it agedâ If we had lived long lifetimesâhere in me), When one day, strolling in the sun, you spoke Words I perceived should hint a coming change: I made three stanzas of the thought, you see: But now 't is like the sea-shell that suggests, And still associates us with the sea In its vague song and elfland workmanship. Yet it has lost a something that it had There by the far sand's foaming; something rare, A different beauty like an element: I wonder on what life will do When love is loser of all love; When life still longs to love anew And has not love enough:â I'll turn my heart into a ray, And waitâa day? I wonder on what love will hold When life is weary of all life; And life and love have both grown old With scars of sin and strife:â I'll change my soul into a flower, And waitâan hour? I wonder on why men forget The life that love made laugh; and why Weak women will remember yet The life that love made sigh:â I'll sing my thought into a song, And waitâhow long? III âAnd once you questioned of our mocking-bird, And of the German nightingale, and I Knowing a sweeter bird than those sweet two, Made fast associates of birds and brooks And learned their numbers. Middle April made The path of lilac leading to your porch A rift of fallen Paradise; a blue So full of fragrance that the birds that built Among the lilacs thought that God was there, And of God's goodness they would sing and sing, Till every throat seemed bursting with its song, Note on wild note, diviner each than each. And waiting by the gate, that reached the lane, For you, who gave sweet eloquence to all, The afternoon, the lilacs and the spring, My heart was singing and it sang of you: Two glow-worms are the jewels in Her ears; and underneath her chin A diamond like a firefly: There is no starlight in the sky When Gwendolyn stands in the maze Of woodbine, near the portico; For all the stars are in her gaze, The night and stars I know. A clinging dream of mist the lawn She wears; and like a bit of dawn Her fan with one red jewel pinned: Among the boughs there breathes no wind When Gwendolyn comes down the path Of lilacs from the portico; For all the breeze her coming hath, The beam and breeze I know. Two locust-blooms her hands; and slips Of eglantine her cheeks and lips; Her hair, a hyacinth of gloom: The balmy buds give no perfume When Gwendolyn draws near to me, The gate beyond the portico; For all aroma sweet is she, All fragrance that I know. Life, love, and faith are in her face, And in her presence all their grace: And my religion is a word, A wish of hers. No mocking-bird, When Gwendolyn laughs near, dare float One bubble from the portico; For all of song is in her throat, All music that I know. IV âThe mocking-bird! and then weird fancy filled My soul with vision, and I saw a song Pursue a bird that was no birdâa voice Concealed in dim expressions of the spring,â Who sits among the forests and the fields, With dark-blue eyes smiling to life the flowers,â Where we strolled happy as the April hills: A sunbeam, all the day that fell Upon the fountain,â Like laughter gurgling in the dell Below the mountain,â Drank, with its sparkle, one by one, The water-words that, in the sun, Made melody,âthe sun-rays tell,â That never yet was done. A moon-ray, that had gone astray 'Mid wildwood alleys, Where Echo haunts the forest way Among the valleys, The livelong night upon the rocks Slept, hid among girl Echo's locks, And stole her voice,âthe moonbeams say,â That mocks and only mocks. A shadow, that had made its seat Amid the roses And thornsâthe bitter and the sweet That life disclosesâ Mixed with the rose-balm and the dew And crimson thorns that pierced it through, Until its soul,âthe shades repeat,â Was portion of them, too. A Fairy found the beam of gold, And ray of glitter; The shadow, whose dim soul did hold Both sweet and bitter; And made a bird, that haunts the morn And night; that flits from flower to thorn, A voice of laughter,âit is told,â Love, mockery, and scorn. V âAmong the white haw-blossoms, where the creek Droned under drifts of dogwood and of haw, The red-bird, like a crimson blossom blown Against the snow-white bosom of the Spring, The chaste confusion of her lawny breast, Sang on, prophetic of serener days, As confident as June's completer hours. And I stood listening like a hind, who hears A wood-nymph breathing in a forest flute Among gray beech-trees of myth-haunted ways: And when it ceased, the memory of the air Blew like a syrinx in my brain: I made A lyric of the notes that men might know: He flies with flirt and flutingâ As flies a falling star From flaming star-beds shootingâ From where the roses are. Wings past and sings; and seven Notes, sweet as fragrance is,â That turn to sylphs in heaven,â Float round him full of bliss. He sings; each burning feather Thrills, throbbing at his throat; A song of glow-worm weather, And of a firefly boat: Of Elfland and a princess Who, born of a perfume, His music lulls,âwhere winces That rose's cradled bloom. No bird is half so airy, No bird of dusk or dawn, O masking King of Fairy! O red-crowned Oberon. VI âAlas! the nightingale I never heard. Yet I, remembering how your voice would thrill Me with exalted expectation, felt The passion-throated nightingale would win Into my soul in some wild way like this, With reminiscences of dusks long dead, Presentiments of nights, that mate the flowers And the prompt stars, and marry them with song. Of such,âlove whispered me when deep in dreams,â I made my nightingale. It is a voice Heard in the April of our year of love: Between the stars and roses There lies a path no man may see, Where every breeze that blows is A wandering melody; Down which each bright star gazes Upon each rose that raises Its face up lovingly, As if with prayers and praises. The star and rose are wiser Than all but love beneath the skies; No hoard of any miser Is rich as these are wise: No bee may reach or rifle, No mist may cloud or stifle Their love that never dies, That knows nor trick nor trifle. There is a bird that carries Love-messages; and comes and goes Between each star that tarries, And every rose that blows: A bird that can not tire, Whose throat 's a throbbing lyre, Whose song is now a rose, And now a starry fire. VII âO May-time woods! O May-time lanes and hours! And stars, that knew how often there at night Beside the path, where woodbine odors blew Between the drowsy eyelids of the dusk,â When, like a great, white, pearly moth, the moon Hung, silvering long windows of your room,â I stood among the shrubs! The dark house slept. I watched and waited forâI know not whatâ Some tremor of your gown: a velvet leaf's Unfolding to caresses of the spring: A rustle of your footsteps: or the dew That softly rolled, a syllable of love, In sweet avowal, from a rose's lips Of odorous scarlet: or the whispered word Of something lovelier than new leaf or roseâ The word young lips half murmur in a dream: Serene with sleep, light visions load her eyes; And underneath her window blooms a quince. The night is a sultana who doth rise In slippered caution, to admit a prince, Love, who her eunuchs and her lord defies. Are these her dreams? or is it that the breeze Pelts me with petals of the quince, and lifts The Balm-of-Gilead buds? and seems to squeeze Aroma on aroma through sweet rifts Of Eden, dripping from the rainy trees? Along the path the buckeye trees begin To heap their hills of blossoms.âOh, that they Were Romeo ladders, whereby I might win Her chamber's sanctity,âwhere love must pray And guard her soul!âso stainless of all sin! There might I see the balsam scent erase Its sweet intrusion; and the starry night Conclude majestic pomp; the virgin grace Of every bud abashed before the white, Pure passion-flower of her sleeping face. VIII âAnd once, in early May, a sparrow sang Among the garden bushes; and you asked If the suave song stayed knocking at my heart. I smiled some answer, and, behold, that night Found that my heart had locked this fancy in: Rain, rain, and a ribbon of song Uncurled where the blossoms are sprinkled; The song-sparrow sings, and I long For the silver-sweet throat, that has tinkled, To sing in the bloom and the rain, Sing again, and again, and again, Under my window-pane. Rain, rain, and the trickling tips Of the million pink blooms of the quinces; And I hear the song rill from the lips, The lute-haunted lips of my princess: O love! in the rain and the bloom, Sing again in the pelting perfume, Sweetheart, under my room. Rain, rain, and the dripping of drops From cups of the blossoms they load, or Tilt over with tipsiest tops: And eyes as of sun-beam and odor, There, under the bloom-blowing treeâ A face like a flower to see, Love is looking at me. IX âOnce in the village I had heard a song, A melody which I wrote down for you, And which you sang. But, there among your hills, The dawns and sunsets and the serious stars Made trite its thought and words, that seemed as stale As musty parlors of the commonplace. I changed its words, and here and there its thought, But, though you praised, you never sang it more, And so I knew, like some poor poet, it Had fallen on disfavor, God knows why, With its high patron. Thus its metre ran: Look, happy eyes, and let me know The timid flower her love hath cherished Fades not before the fruit shall show, Seen in the clear truth of your glow Where naught of love hath perished. Lift, happy lips, and let me take The sacred secret of her spirit To mine in kisses, that shall make Mute marriage of our souls, and wake The heart's sweet silence near it. X âAnd so I wrote another filled with birds, Deliberate twilight and eve's punctual star; And made the music of that song obey The metre of my own and melody: Only to hear that you love me, Only to feel it is true; Stars and the gloaming above me, I in the gloaming with you. Staining through violet fire, A sunset of poppy and gold, Red as a heart with desire, Rich with a secret untold. Deep where the shadows are doubled, Deep where the blossoms are long, Listen!âdeep love in the bubbled Breath of a mocking-bird's song. You, who have made them the dearer, Drawing them near from afar!â Stars and the heaven the nearer, Sweet, through the joy that you are. XI âConfronted with the certainty that I Had no approval for my love from you, No visible sign, but my own prompting hope's, Conforming with my heart's one wild desire, Who had not dreaded disappointment there! The shadow of a heart's unformed denial, That should take form and soon confirm the doubt: The doubt that would content itself with this: If I might hold her by the hand,â Her hands so full of soothing peace!â Her heart would hear and understand My heart's demand, And all her idling cease. If she would let my eyes look in Her eyes, whose deeps are full of truth, Her soul might see how mine would win Her, without sin, In all her happy youth. If I might kiss her mouth, and lead The kiss up to her eyes and hair, There is no prayer that so could plead,â And find sure heed,â My love's divine despair. XII âAnd, uninstructed, smiled and wrote âdespair,â Enamoured, yet fearful of the shade that should Some day come stealing through my silent door To sit unbidden through the lonely hours.â I cast the shudder off, and in the fields Found hope again, and beauty born of dreams: For it was summer, and all living things, The common flowers and the birds and bees, Became interpreters of love for me: Say that he can not tell her how he loves herâ Words, for such adoration, often fail,â When but a bow of ribbon, glove that gloves her, Clothes her fair femininity in mail. So many ways and wisdoms to express what To th' language of devotion is denied; Ambassadors to make the maiden guess what Before her heart's high fortress long has sighed. A bird to sing his secretâshe'll perpend him: A bee to bid her soul to hear and see: A blossom, like a sweet appeal, to bend him, Before her there, upon a worshiping knee. XIII âSo was my love confessed to you. I thought You loved me as love led me to believe: And so, no matter where I, dreaming, went Among the hills, the woods, and quiet fields, All had a poetry so intimate, So happy and so ready that, for me, 'Twas but to stoop and gather as I went, As one goes reaching roses in the June. Three withered wild ones that I gathered then I send you now. Their scent and bloom are dust: 1 What wild-flower shows perfection Such as thy face, no blemish mars? I leave to the selection Of all the wild-flower stars: To every wildwood bloom that blows, Wild phlox, wild daisy, and wild rose. What cascade hath suspicion O' the marvel that thy whiteness is? I leave to the decision Of each proclaiming breeze: To winds that kiss the buds awake, And roll the ripple on the lake. What bird can sing the naming Of all the music that thou art? I leave to the proclaiming Of that within my heart: My heart, wherein, the whole day long, Sits adoration rapt in song. 2 What witch then hast thou met, Who wrought this amulet? This charm, that makes each look, love, Of thine a rose; Thy face an open book, love, Where beauty gleams and glows, And thought to music set. What fairy of the wood, To whom thou once wast good, Gave thee this gift?âThy words, love, Should be pure gold; And all thy songs as bird's, love, Sweet as the Mays of old With youth and love imbued. What elfin of the glade This white enchantment made, That filled thee with the essence Of all the Junes? That made thy soul, thy presence, Like to the moon's Above a far cascade. What wizard of the cave Hath made my heart thy slave? That dreams of thee when sleeping, And, when awake, My anxious spirit keeping 'Neath spells I can not break, Sweet spells, whence naught can save. 3 Dear, (though given conclusion to), Songs,âno memory surrenders,â Still their music breathe in you; Silence meditation renders Audible with notes it knew. Sweet, when all the flowers are dead, Perfumes,âthat the heart remembers Made of them a marriage-bed,â Shall not fail me in December's Gloom, but from your face be shed. Dear, when night denies a star, Darkness will not suffer, seeing Song and fragrance are not far; Starlight of the summer being In the loveliness you are. XIV âRevealing distant vistas where I thought I saw your love stand as 'mid lily blooms, Long, angel goblets molded out of stars, Pouring aroma at your feet: and life Took fire with thoughts your soul must help you read: A song; and songs (who does not know?) Reveal no music but is thine. Thou singest, and the waters flow, The breezes blow, The sunbeams shine, And all the earth grows young, divine. Low laughter; and I look away; Whate'er the time of year, I dream I walk beneath sweet skies of May On ways where play Both gloom and gleam, And hear a bird and forest stream. A thought; and straight it seems to me, However dark, the stars arise, And rain down memories of thee,â As, it may be, From Paradise One feels an angel-lover's eyes. XV âBut is it well to tell you what I felt When I beheld no change beyond the moods That gloomed or glistened in your raven eyes? When I sat singing 'neath one steadfast star Of morning with no phantoms of strange fears To slay the look or word that helped me sing: When song came easier than come buds in spring, That make the barren boughs one pomp of pearls: Oh, let the happy day go past, And let the night be short or long, When life and love are one at last, And hearts are full of song, 'Tis sweet midsummer of the dream, And all the dreams thou hast Are truer than they seem. And once I dreamt in autumn of Death with cadaverous eyes that gazed From out a shadow ... It was love Whose deathless eyes were raised From the deep darkness that unrolled Wild splendor; and, amazed, Thy soul I did behold. And then it seemed that some one said, The dead are nearer than dost know. And when they tell thee love is dead,â Although it seems 't is so,â Still shalt thou feel in every beat And heart-throb of thy woe Love breathing, bitter-sweet. XVI âOne evening when I came to talk with you, Impatience hurt me in your brief replies. And I who had refused,âbecause we dread Approaching horror of our lives made maimed,â The inevitable, could not help but see Some change in you to'ards me.âThat night I dreamed I wandered 'mid old ruins, where the snake And scorpion crawled in poison-spotted heat; Plague-bloated bulks of hideous vine and root Wrapped fallen fanes; and bristling cacti bloomed Blood-red and death-white on forgotten tombs. And from my soul went forth a bitter cry That pierced the silence that was packed with death And pale presentiment. And so I went, A white flame beckoning before my face, And in my ears sounds of primordial seas That boasted preadamic gods and men: A flame before me and, beyond, a voice: But, lo, the white flame when I reached for it Became thin ashes like a dead man's dust; And when I thought I should behold the sea, Stagnation, turned to filth and rottenness, Rolled out a swamp: the voice became a stench. If we should pray together now For sunshine and for rain, And thou shouldst get fair weather now, And I the clouds again, Would ray and rain keep single, Or for the rainbow mingle? Dear, if this should be made to me, That I had asked for light, And God had given shade to me, And all to thee that 's bright, Wouldst thou go by with scorning, Refusing darkness morning? If all my life were winter, love, And all thy life were spring, And mine with frost should splinter, love, While thine with birds should sing, Wouldst thou walk past and glitter, Forgetful mine is bitter? XVII âStill on the anguish of a dying hope An infant hope was nourished; all in vain. For, at the last, although we parted friends, The friendship lay like sickness on my soul, That saw all gladness perish from the world With loss of thee; and, 'mid the future years, Love building high a sepulchre for hope. Ah, could you learn forgetfulness, And teach my heart how to forget; And I unlearn all fretfulness, And teach your soul that still will fret; The mornings of the world would burn Before us and we would not turn, For we would not regret. Did you but know what sorrow keeps, That drives the joy of life away, And I what each to-morrow keeps For us until it is to-day; No grief or change would then surprise Our lives with what our lives were wise, And nothing could betray. If you could be interior to My dreams that are all love's desire; And I could be superior to Myself and such in you inspire; Long stairways would the years unroll To lift us upward, soul to soul, To what celestial fire! XVIII âThere came no words of comfort from your lips. Not that I asked for pity! that had been As fire unto the scalded or dry bread Unto the famished fallen 'mid the sands! But all your actions said that I was wrong, But how, I know not and have ceased to care; Still standing like one stricken blind at noon, Who gropes and fumbles, feeling all grow strange That once was so familiar; cursing God Who locks him in with darkness and despair.â Your judgment had been juster had it had A lesser love than mine to judge.âO love, Where lay the justice of thy judge in this?â âIf thou hadst praised thy God as long As thou hast praised a woman's eyes, Perhaps thou hadst not suffered wrong, As now, and sat with sighs: But, through thy prayer and praise made strong, Perhaps thou hadst grown wise. âIf thou hadst bade thy God be more Than I, thy life had not been sad; His love to thee had not been poor As mine. But thou wast mad, And cam'st, a beggar, to my door, And had more than I had. âIf thou hadst taught me how to love, Nor played with love as monarchs play, My heart had learned right soon enough, From thine, love's lowlier way. But all thy love stood far above, Nor touched my soul to sway.â XIX âThus did you write me, or in words like these, When all was over and your heart was led, Through pity, haply, thus to justify Yourself, that needed not to justify, Since all your reason lay in four small words, Enough to wreck my world and all my life, You did not love: what more is there to tell?â Yet, haply, it was this: One soul, that still Demanded more than it could well return; And, searching inward, yet could never pierce Beyond its superficiality. You did not know; yet I had felt in me The rich fulfillment of a rare accord, And could not, though the longing lay like song And music on me, win your soul's response. Were it well, lifting me Eyes that give heed, Down in your soul to see Thought, the affinity Of act and deed? Knowing what naught may tell Of heart and soul: Yet were the knowledge whole, And were it well? Were it well, giving true Love all enough, Still to discover new Depths of true love for you, Infinite love? Feeling what naught may tell Of heart and soul: Yet were the knowledge whole, And were it well? XX âWhat else but, laboring for some good, to lift Ourselves above the despotism of self, All egoism strangling strength and hope, To work and work, and, in the love of work, Which takes the place, in some, of love's real self, To quench the flame that eats into the heart? Art, our intensest and our truest love, Immaculateness that has never led One of her lovers wrong, his love all soul! I followed beauty, and my ardor prayed Your memory would, feature and form and face, Be blotted out within me; rise no more To mar the labor that I owed to Art. I prayed, yea, to forget you, you I loved: I prayed; and, see!âhow Heaven answered me: I have no song to tell thee The love that I would sing; The song that should enspell thee With words, and so compel thee That thou, with love, must wing Into my life to-morrowâ For all my songs are sorrow. My strength is not a giant To hold thee with strong hands, To make thee less defiant; Thy spirit more compliant With all my love demands: Alas! my love is meekness, And all my strength is weakness. What hope have I to hoverâ When wings refuse to riseâ Within thy heart's close cover, And there to play the lover, Concealed from mortal eyes? What hope! to give me boldness, When all thy looks are coldness? XXI âI prayed; and for a time felt strong as strength, And held both hands out to the loveliness That lured in the ideal. And I felt Compelling power upon me that would lift My face to heaven, now, to see the stars, Now bend it back to earth to see the flowers. I learned long lessons 'twixt a look and look: Breezes and linden blooms, Sunshine and showers; Rain, that the May perfumes, Cupped in the flowers: Clouds and the leaves that patter Raindrops that glint and glareâ Or be they gems that scatter? Sapphires the sylphides shake, When their loose fillets break, Out of their radiant hair? Now is my heart a lute! Now doth it pinion Song in love's swift pursuit In thought's dominion! Dreaming of all thou meanest, Thou, with uneager eyes, Nature! of worlds thou queenest, Whither thy mother hand Draws us from land to land, Far from the worldly wise! XXII âThus would I scatter grain around my life, Gold grain of song, to lure them down to me, Cloud-colored doves of peace to fill my soul, And find them turn to ravens while they flew, Black ravens of despair that would not out. The old, dull, helpless aching at the heart, As if some scar had turned a wound again. While idle grief stared at the brutal past, Which held a loss that made the past more rich Than all Earth's arts: that marveled how it came Such puny folly should usurp love's high Proud pedestal of life that held your form, In Parian, sculptured by the hands of thought. And oft I shook myself,âfor nightmares weighed Each sense,âand seemed to wake; yet evermore Beheld a death's-head grinning at my eyes. So when the opening of the door doth thrill My soul with sudden knowledge death is come, Let me forget you or remember still, It will not matter then that life went ill, When death bends to me and my lips are dumb. Then I shall not remember: and shall leave No memory behind me, and no trace Of aught my life accomplished. Let none grieve. There is no heart my passing will bereave; And there are thousands who can fill my place. Who knocks?âThe night camps on each hill and heath: And round my door are minions of the night: And like a weapon, riven from its sheath, The wind sweeps, and the tempest grinds its teeth Around me and my wild, hand-hollowed light. Who knocks?âthe door is open!âAnd I see The Darkness threatening, with distorted fists Of cloudy terror, Courage on her knee: Shine far, O candle! for it so may be Love is bewildered in the night and mists.â No wandering wisp art thou, that haunts the rain With pallid flicker, fading as it flies!â The door is open!âWill he knock again?â The door is open!âShall it be in vain?â Come in! delay not! thou, whose ways are wise! Who knocked has entered: let the darkness pass, The door be closed!âNow morning lights shall thrust It open; and the sunlight shine and mass Its splendor here where once but darkness was, And in its raysâmotes and a little dust.â XXIII And I had read, read to the bitter end; Half hearing lone surmises of the rain And trouble of the wind. At last I rose And went to Gwendolyn. She did not know The kiss I gave her had a shudder in it; Nor how the form of Julien rose between Me and her lips, a blood-stain o'er his heart. THE IDYLL OF THE STANDING-STONE I She knows its windings and its crooks; The wildflowers of its lovely woods; The crowfoot's golden sisterhoods, That crowd its sunny nooks: The iris, whose blue blossoms seem Mab's bonnets; and, each leaf a-gleam, The trillium's fairy-books. He knows its shallows and its pools, Its stair-like beds of rock that go, Foaming, with waterfall and flow, Where dart the minnow schools; Its grassy banks that herons haunt, Or where the woodcock call; and gaunt The mushrooms lift their stools. She seeks the columbine and phlox, The bluebell, where the bushes fill The old stones of the ruined mill; She wades among the rocks: Her feet are rose-pearl in the stream; Her eyes are bluet-blue; a beam Lies on her nut-brown locks. He comes with fishing-reel and line To angle in the darker deeps, Where the reflected forest sleeps Of sycamore and pine: And now and then a shadow swoops Above him of a hawk that stoops From skies as clear as wine. And will he see, if they should meet, That she is fairer than each flower Her apron fills? and in that hour Feel life less incomplete? ... He stops below: she walks aboveâ The brook floats down, as white as love, One blossom to his feet. And she?âshould she behold the tan Of manly face and honest eyes, Would all her soul idealize Him? make him more than man? ... She dropped one blossom when she heard Soft whistlingâwas it man or bird, Whose notes so sweetly ran? They knew before they came to meet; For some divulging influence Had touched them thro' the starry lens God holds to bring in beat Two heartsâher heart one haunting wish, And hisâforgetful of the fish, Her flower at his feet. II The sassafras twigs had just lit up The yellow stars of their fragrant candles, And the dogwood brimmed each blossom-cup With spring to its brown-tipped handles; When down the orchard, 'mid apple bloomsâ Say, ho, the hum o' the honey-bee!â A glimpse of Spring in the sprinkled glooms? Or only a girl? with the warm perfumes Blown round her breezily. The maple, as red as the delicate flush Of an afterglow, was airy crimson; And the haw-tree, white in the wing-whipped hush, Gleamed cool as a cloud that the moonlight dims on; And under the oak, whose branches strungâ Say, heigh, the rap o' the sapsuckÃ©r!â Gray buds in tassels that sweetly swung, They stood and listened a bird that sung, As glad as the heart in her. Yellow the bloom of the rattle-weed, And white the bloom of the plum and cherry; And red as a stain the red-bud's brede, And clover the color of sherry: And a wren sings there in the orchard drift,â And, ho! the dew from the web that slips!â And a thrush sings there in the woodland rift, Where he to his face her doth lift, Her face with the willing lips. For a while they sat on the moss and grass, Where the forest bloomed a great wild garden;â Then the beam from the hollowâit seemed to pass, And the ray on the hills to harden, When she rose to go, and his joy fell flat;â And, heigh, the wasp i' the pawpaw bell!â As she waved her handâwhy, it seemed at that 'Twas Spring's own self he was gazing at, And the life of his life as well. III The teasel and the horsemint spread The hillsides, as with sunset sown, Blooming along the Standing-Stone That ripples in its rocky bed: There are no treasuries that hold Gold yellower than the marigold That crowds its mouth and head. 'T is harvest-time: a mower stands Among the morning wheat and whets His scythe, and for a space forgets The labor of the ripening lands; Then bends, and through the dewy grain His long scythe hisses, and again He swings it in his hands. And she beholds him where he mows On acres whence the water sends Faint music of reflecting bends And falls that interblend with flows: She stands among the old bee-gums,â Where all the apiary hums,â Like some sweet bramble-rose. She hears him whistling as he leans, And, reaping, sweeps the ripe wheat by; She sighs and smiles and knows not why:â These are but simple country scenes: He whets his scythe again, and sees Her smiling near the hives of bees Beneath the flowering beans. The peacock-purple lizard creeps Along the rail; and deep the drone Of insects makes the country lone With summer where the water sleeps: She hears him singing as he swings His scythe; he thinks of other thingsâ Not toil, and, singing, reaps. IV Into the woods they went again, Over the wind-blown oats; Out of the acres of golden grain, In where the light was a violet stain, In where the lilies' throats Were brimmed with the summer rain. Hung on a bough a reaper's hook, Over the wind-blown oats; A girl's glad laugh and a girl's glad look, And the hush and ripple of tree and brook, And a wild bird's silvery notes, And a kiss that a strong man took. Out of the woods the lovers went, Over the wind-waved wheat; She with a face, where love was blent, Like to an open testament; He, from his head to feet, Dazed with his hope that was eloquent. Here how oft had they come to tryst, Over the wind-waved wheat! Here how oft had they laughed and kissed! Talked and tarried where no one wist, Here where the woods are sweet, Dim and deep as a dewy mist. V Her pearls are blossoms-of-the-vale, Her only diamonds are the dews; Such jewels never can grow stale, Nor any value lose. Among the millet beards she stands: The languid wind lolls everywhere: There are wild roses in her hands, One wild rose in her hair. To-morrow, where the shade is warm, Among the unmown wheat she 'll stop, And from one daisy-loaded arm One ox-eyed daisy drop. She 'll meet his brown eyes, true and brave, With blue eyes, false yet dreamy sweet: He is her lover and her slave, Who mows among the wheat. When buds broke on the apple trees She wore an apple-blossom dress, And laughed with him across the leas, And love was all a guess. When goose-plums ripened in the rain, Plum-colored was her gown of red; He kissed her in the creek-road laneâ She was his life, he said. When apples thumped the droughty land, A russet color was her gown: Another came, andâwon her hand?â Nay! carried off to town. ... When grapes hung purple in the hot, None missed her and her simple dress, Save one, whom, haply, she forgot, Who loved her none the less. When snow made white each harvest sheaf, He sought her out amid her show; Her rubies, redder than the leaf That autumn forests sow. Not one regret her shame reveals; She smiles at him, then puts him by; He pleads; and she? she merely steels Her heart andâlives her lie. VI And he returned when poppies strewed Their golden blots o'er moss and leaf,â Blond little Esaus of the wood, So fair of face, of life so brief.â Did he forget?âNot he, in truth!â âNo month,â he thought, âholds so much grace, No month of spring, such grace and youth, As the sweet April of her face.â In fall the frail gerardia Hung hints of sunset and of dawn On root and rock, as if to draw Her lips, remind him of one gone:â Of one unworthy, in pursuit Of butterflies, who does not dream A flower, broken by her foot, Sweeps, helpless, with her down the stream. SOME SUMMER DAYS I If you had seen her waiting there Among the tiger-lily blooms,â That sowed their jewels everywhere Among the woodland gleams and glooms,â You had confessed her very fair, And sweeter than the wood's perfumes. A country girl with bare brown feet, She waits, while day slopes down the deeps: The afternoon is dead with heat, And all the weary shadow sleeps Like toil, arm-pillowed in the wheat, Beside the scythe with which he reaps. There is no sound more distant than The cow-bell on the vine-hung hill; No nearer than the locust's span Of noise that makes the silence shrill: And now there comes a sun-browned man Through tiger-lilies of the rill. Long will they talk: till, in the end, The clear west glows, the east grows pale; Until the glow and pallor blend Like moonlight on a shifting sail; And then he'll clasp her; she will bend Her head, consenting. Day will fail: The west will flame, then fade away Through heavy orange, rose, and red, And leave the heavens violet gray Above a gypsy-lily bed: Then they will go; and he will say Such words to her as none has said. A million stars the night will win Above them; and one firefly Pulse like a tangled starbeam in The cedar dark against the sky: Then he will lift her dimpled chin And take the kiss she'll not deny. And when the moon, like the great book Of Judgment, golden with the light Of God, lies open o'er yon nook Of darkest wood and wildest height, Together they will cross the brook And reach the gate and kiss good night. II And now he wipes his hand along The beaded fire of his brow Hard toil has heated; and the strong Face flushes fuller health as now He fills his hay-fork to the prong, And, tossing it, again doth bow. And now he rests, and looks away Across the sun-fierce hills and meads No rolling cloud has cooled to-day; And from his face the brawny beads Drip; and he marks the heaps of hay, The fields of corn, the fields of weeds. At last he sees the tempest build Black battlements along the west, Black breastworks that are thunder filled; And bares his brow; and on his chest The sweat of toil is cooled; and stilled The pulse of toil within his breast. A strong wind brings the odorous death Of far hay-meadows, and the scent Is good within his nostrils' breath: The mighty trees are bowed, that leant For no man, as when Power saith âBow down!â and stalwart men are bent. He laughs, long-gazing as he goes Along the elder-sweetened lane: He feels the storm wind as it blows Across the sheaves of golden grain, And stops to pull one bramble-rose, And watch the swiftly coming rain. And there, 'mid locust trees, the farm Dreams in a martin-haunted place: He marks the far-off streaks of storm That, driven of the thunder, race: He sees his child upon her arm, And in the door his wife's fair face. III Below the sunset's range of rose, Below the heaven's bending blue, Down woodways where the balsam blows, And milkweed tufts hang, gray of hue, A Jersey heifer stops and lowsâ The cows come home by one, by two. There is no star yet: but the smell Of hay and pennyroyal mix With herb-aromas of the dell; And the root-hidden cricket clicks: Among the ironweeds a bell Clangs near the rail-fenced clover-ricks. She waits upon the slope beside The windlassed well the plum-trees shade, The well-curb that the goose-plums hide; Her light hand on the bucket laid, Unbonneted she waits, glad-eyed, Her dress as simple as her braid. She sees fawn-colored backs among The sumacs now; a tossing horn; A clashing bell of brass that rung: Long shadows lean upon the corn, And all the day dies scarlet-stung, The cloud in it a rosy thorn. Below the pleasant moon, that tips The tree-tops of the hillside, fly The evening bats; the twilight slips Some fireflies like spangles by; She meets him, and their happy lips Touch; and one star leaps in the sky. He takes her bucket, and they speak Of married hopes while in the grass The plum lies glowing as her cheek; The patient cows look back or pass; And in the west one golden streak Burns like a great cathedral glass. IV The skies are amber, blue, and green Before the coming of the sun; And all the deep hills sleep, serene As if enchanted; every one Is ribbed with morning mists that lean On woods through which vague whispers run. Birds wake: and on the vine-hung knobs, Above the brook, a twittering Confuses songs; one warbler robs Another of its note; a wing Beats by; and now a wild throat throbs Triumphant; all the woodlands sing. The sun is up: the hills are heaped With instant splendor; and the vales Surprised with shimmers that are steeped In purple where the thin mist trails; The water-fall, the rock it leaped, Are burning gold that foams and fails. He drives his horses to the plow Along the vineyard slopes, where bask Dew-heavy grapes, half-ripened now, In sun-shot shafts of shade: no mask Of joy he wears; his face and brow Glow as he enters on his task. Before him, soaring through the mist, The gray hawk wildly wings and screams; Its dewy back gleams, sunbeam-kissed, Above the wood that drips and dreams; He guides the plow with one strong fist; The soil rolls back in level seams. Packed to the right the sassafras Lifts leafy walls of spice that shade The blackberries, whose tendrils mass Big berries in the coolness made; And drop their ripeness on the grass Where trumpet-flowers fall and fade. White on the left the fence and trees That mark the garden; and the smoke, Uncurling in the early breeze, Tells of the roof beneath the oak; He turns his team, and, turning, sees The damp, dark soil his coulter broke. Bees hum; and o'er the berries poise Lean-bodied wasps; loud blackbirds turn Following the plow: there is a noise Of insect wings that buzz and burn;â And now he hears his wife's low voice, The song she sings to help her churn. V There are no clouds that drift around The moon's pearl-kindled crystal, (white As some sky-summoned spirit wound In raiment lit with limbs of light), That have not softened like the sound Of harps when Heaven forgets to smite. The vales are deeper than the dark, And darker than the vales the woods That shadowy hill and meadow mark With broad, blurred lines, whereover broods Deep calm; and now a fox-hound's bark Upon the quietude intrudes. And though the night is never still, Yet what we name its noises makes Its silence:ânow a whippoorwill; A frog, whose hoarser tremor breaks The hush; then insect sounds that fill The night; an owl that hoots and wakes. They lean against the gate that leads Into the lane that lies between The yard and orchard; flowers and weeds Smell sweeter than the odors keen That day distils from hotness; beads Of dew make cool the gray and green. Their infant sleeps. They feel the peace Of something done that God has blessed, Still as the pulse that will not cease There in the cloud that lights the west: The peace of love that shall increase While soul to soul still gives its best. AN EPIC OF SOUTH-FORK I The wild brook gleams on the sand and ripples Over the rocks of the riffle; brimming Under the elms like a nymph who dripples, Dips and glimmers and shines in swimming: Under the linns and the ash-trees lodging, Loops of the limpid waters lie, Shaken of schools of the minnows, dodging The glancing wings of the dragon-fly. Lower, the loops are lines of laughter Over the stones and the crystal gravel; Afar they gloom, like a face seen after Mirth, where the waters slowly travel; Shadowy slow where the Fork is shaken Of the dropping bark of the sycamore, Where the water-snake, that the footsteps waken, Slides like a crooked root from shore. Peace of the forest; and silence, dimmer Than dreams. And now a wing that winnows The willow leaves, with their shadows slimmer In the shallow there than a school of minnows: Calm of the creek; and a huge tree twisted, Ringed, and turned to a tree of pearl; A gray-eyed man, who is farmer-fisted, And a dark-eyed, sinewy country girl. The brow of the man is gnarled and wrinkled With the weight of the words that have just been spoken; And the girl has smiled and her eyes have twinkled, Though the bonds and the bands of their love lie broken: She smiles, nor knows how the days have knotted Her to the heart of the man who says: âLet us follow the paths that we think allotted. I will go my ways and you your ways. âAnd the man between us is your decision. Worse or better he is your lover.â Shall I say he 's worse since the sweet Elysian Prize he wins where I discover Only the hell of the luckless chooser?â Shall I say he 's better than I, or more, Since he is winner and I am loser, His life 's made rich and mine made poor?â âI tell you now as I oft and ever Have told,â she answered, the laughter dying Down in her eyes, âthat his arms have never Held me!âno!âbut you think me lying, And you are wrong. And I think it better To part forever than still to dwell With the sad distrust, like an evil tetter, On our lives forever, and so farewell.â And she turned away; and he watched her going, The girlish pride in her eyes a-smoulder: He saw her go, and his lips were glowing Fever that parched. And he stood, one shoulder Slouched to the tree; and he saw her stooping, There by the bank, with a reckless foot; Straighten; and tear from her breast his drooping Lilies and fasten the pleurisy-root. With its orange fire he saw her passing On and on; and the blood beat, burning His brain to madness; and seemingly massing The weight of the world on his heart in yearning ... Butterflies swarmed in the moist sand-alleys; A fairy fleet of Ionian sails They seemed with their wings, or of pirate galleys, Maroon and yellow, for Elfland gales. He watched her going; and harder, thicker The pulse of his breath and his heart's hard throbbing.â How should he know that her heart was sicker? How should he know that her soul was sobbing?â She never looked back: and he saw her vanish In swirls of the startled butterflies, Like a storm of flowers; and he could not banish The thought he had lost his all through lies. II He heard the cocks crow out the lonely hours. How long the night! how far away the dawn! It seemed long months since he had seen the flowers, The leaves, the sunlight, and the bee-hived lawn; Had heard the thrush flute in the tangled showers. His burning eyes ached, staring at the black Stolidity of midnight. Would God send No cool relief unto his mind,âa rack Of inquisition,âtortures to unbend, That stretched him forward and now strained him back? Incomprehensible and undivulged, The thought that took him back, retraced their walks, Through woods, on which the sudden perfumes bulged, The bird-songs and the brilliant-blossomed stalks; And all the freedom which their talk indulged. Oh, strong appeal! And he would almost yield; When, firmly forward, he could feel her fault Oppose the error of a rock-like shield, And to resisting phalanxes cry haltâ And, lo! bright cohorts broken on the field. O mulct of morning! to the despot night Count down unminted gold, and let the day Walk free from dungeons of the dark; delight Herself on mountains of the violet ray, Clad in white maidenhood and morning white! A melancholy coast, plunged deep in dream And death and silence, stretched the drowsy dark, Wherein he heard a round-eyed screech-owl scream, In lamentation, and a watch-dog bark, Vague as oblivion, lost in night's deep stream. And then hope moved him to divide the blinds To see if those bright sparkles were a star's, Or but his feverish eyelids, which the mind's Commotion weighed.âNo hint of morning bars With glimmer heaven's swart tapestry he finds. So he remained, impatient, till the first Exploring crevices of Aztec morn, Dim cracks of treasure, Eldorados burst: Then could he face his cowardice and scorn His jealousy that thus his life had cursed. Love knew no barriers now. And where he went Each woodland path was musical with birds; Each flow'r was richer, more divine of scent; For love sought love with such expressive words That dawn's delivery was less eloquent. III Who is it hunts with his dog There where the heron is flying Gray through the feathering fog Over the Fork, where is lying, Bridge-like, a butternut log, There where the horsemint is drying? Who is it hunts in the brush, Under the linns and the beeches, Here where the water-falls rush, Dark, where the noon never reaches? Here where the Fork is one crush Of flags with a bloom like the peach's? He is handsome and supple and tall, Blond-haired and vigorous-chested, Blue-eyed as the bud by the fall Where he listens,âhis rifle half rested, Half leaned on the crumbling stone wall,â Whose briers he lately has breasted. He waits; and the sun on the dew Of the cedars and leaves of the bushes Strikes glittering frostiness through ... If a covey of partridges flushes What good will a Winchester do, Or the dog to his feet that he crushes? Then a man breaks strong through the weeds Where the buck-bushes toss and the spires Of the white-blossomed cohosh; 'mid reeds Wild-carrots, and trammelling briers: It is he! to his loved one who speedsâ And the man in the bushesâhe fires. ... From leaves of the wind-shaken wood The dew of the dawn is still falling: He is gone from the place where he stood, Just there where the black crow is calling: There is blood on the weeds: is it blood On the face of the man who is crawling? Red blood or a smudge of the dawn?â Now he lies with his gray eyes wide, staring, Stiff, still at the sun: he has drawn His limbs in a heap: and the faring Bee-martins light near or pass on, Not one of them knowing or caring. It is noon: and the wood-dove is deep In the calm of its cooing: and over The tops of the forest trees sweep The shadows of buzzards that hover: Wide-winged they sail on as asleep: And the bob-white is whistling from cover. It is dusk: and the heat, that made wilt The leaves and the wildflowers' faces, Gives place to the dew-drops that tilt With coolness the weeds where are traces Of horror and darkness and guilt, That nothing can wash from those places. It is night: and the hoot-owlet mocks The dove of the day with wild weeping, The Fork is scarce heard on its rocks Where the man is so quietly sleeping: Through the woods snaps the bark of a fox; The lightning is fitfully leaping. IV All day, 'twixt hope and fear, She waited at the gate, Looking for him, more dear Now that he made her wait: Day went and night draws near: Stormy it grows and late. Still, still she waits: great limbs The winds rend from the ridge; Each swollen shallow swims Head-deep below the bridge; The drift, that breaks and brims Swirls lighter than the midge. The night grows wildly gray With lightning-litten rain; The forests sound and sway, An oak is rent in twain; The thunder rolls away Like some vast bolt and chain. The Fork is whirling wreck Of field and farm and wood; And many a foaming fleck Drives where the rock-fence stood;â A torrent sweeps break-neck Above the washed-out blood. Night deepens: still she waits Expectant in despair: The Fork has reached the gates, The wood's wreck everywhere. But when the storm abates, She thinks, he will be there. She sees the lightning rush Its blazing hells above; She hears the thunder crush Heaven as if earthquake-cloveâ Loud in the tempest's hush She calls with all her love. He comes, she feels; and stands The rushing waters o'er Her feet, and on her hands And hair the wild down-pour, The lightnings are wild brands To light him to her door. Night deepens: but she knows God will not fail to send Her love to soothe her woes, And one day's errors mend.â The wild stream foams and flows Booming in fall and bend. Again the lightnings light The night like some wild torch; The waters foam and fight; And one uprooted larch Sweeps down, with something white Wedged in it, by her porch. She stoops: the lurid rain Beats on her back and headâ Ay! he hath come again! With livid lips once red! A bullet in his brain The night hath brought himâdead! A NIELLO I It is not early spring and yet Of bloodroot blooms along the stream, And blotted banks of violet, My heart will dream. Is it because the wind-flower apes The beauty that was once her brow, That the white thought of it still shapes The April now? Because the wild-rose learned its blush From her fresh cheeks of maidenhood, Their thought makes June of barren brush And empty wood? And then I think how young she diedâ Straight, barren death stalks down the trees, The hard-eyed hours by his side That kill and freeze. II When orchards are in bloom again My heart will bound, my blood will beat, To hear the red-bird so repeat, On boughs of rosy stain, His blithe, loud song,âlike some far strain From out the past,âamong the bloom,â (Where bee, and wasp, and hornet boom)â Fresh, redolent with rain. When orchards are in bloom once more, Invasions of lost dreams will draw My feet, like some insistent law, Through blossoms to her door: In dreams I'll ask her, as before, To let me help her at the well; And fill her pail; and long to tell My love as once of yore. I shall not speak until we quit The farm-gate, leading to the lane And orchard, all in bloom again, 'Mid which the wood-doves sit And coo; and through whose blossoms flit The cat-birds crying while they fly: Then tenderly I'll speak, and try To tell her all of it. And in my dream again she'll place Her hand in mine, as oft before,â When orchards are in bloom once more,â With all her old-time grace: And we will tarry till a trace Of sunset dyes the heav'ns; and thenâ We'll part, and, parting, I again Will bend and kiss her face. And homeward, dreaming, I will go Along the cricket-chirring ways, While sunset, like one crimson blaze Of blossoms, lingers low: And my lost youth again I'll know, And all her love, when spring is hereâ Hers! hers! now dead this many a year Whose love still haunts me so. III I would not die when Springtime lifts The white world to her maiden mouth, And heaps its cradle with gay gifts, Breeze-blown from out the singing South: Too full of life and loves that cling, Too heedless of all mortal woe, The young, unsympathetic Spring, That death should never know. I would not die when Summer shakes Her daisied locks below her hips, And, naked as a star that takes A cloud, into the silence slips. Too rich is Summer; poor in needs; Wrapped in her own warm loveliness Her pomp goes by, and never heeds If one be more or less. But I would die when Autumn goes, The sad rain dripping from her hair, Through forests where the wild wind blows Death and the red wreck everywhere: Sweet as love's last farewells and tears 'T would be to die, when heavens are gray, In the old autumn of my years, Like a dead leaf borne far away. DEEP IN THE FOREST I SPRING ON THE HILLS Ah, shall I follow, on the hills, The Spring, as wild wings follow? Where wild-plum trees make wan the hills, Crab-apple trees the hollow, Haunts of the bee and swallow? In red-bud brakes and flowery Acclivities of berry; In dogwood dingles, showery With dew, where wrens make merry? Or drifts of swarming cherry? In valleys of wild-strawberries, And of the clumped May-apple; Or cloud-like trees of hawberries, With which the south-winds grapple, That brook and pathway dapple? With eyes of far forgetfulness,â Like some white wood-thing's daughter, Whose feet are bee-like fretfulness,â To see her run like water Through boughs that slipped or caught her. O Spring, to seek, yet find you not, To search and still continue; To glimpse, to touch, but bind you not, To lose and then to win you, All sweet evasion in you. In pearly, peach-blush distances You gleam; the woods are braided Of myths, of dream-existences;â There, where the brook is shaded, Some splendor surely faded. O presence, like the primrose's, Once more I feel your power! In rainy scents of dim roses I breathe you for an hour, Elusive as a flower. II THE WOOD SPIRIT Ah me! I still remember How flushed, before the shower, The dusk was; like a scarlet rose, Or blood-red poppy-flower. Now heaven is starred; the moonlight Lays blurs upon the grainâ You may not know it from white frost, The moonlight on the rain. And all the forest utters A restless moan in rest, For all the deep, dark shadow lies Like iron on its breast. I mark the moveless shadow, I mark the unreaped corn, Then something whispers overhead, âCome to me, mortal-born.â I sit alone and listen; The low leaves sound and sigh; The dew drips from the bearded grain, A mist slips from the sky.â I hear her whisper, whisper, And breathe in some dim place; Her feet are easier than the dew, And than the mist her face. I may not clasp her ever, This spirit made for song, Who dwelleth in the young, young oak The old, old oaks among. Her limbs are molded moonlight; Her breasts are silver moons: She glimmers and she glitters where The purple shadow swoons. And since she knows I love her, She says my soul has died, And laughs and mocks me in the mist That haunts the forest-side. When winds run mad in woodlands And all the great boughs swing, I see her wild hair blow and blow Black as a raven's wing. When winds are tamed and tethered And stars are keen as frost, I search and seek within the wood, There where my soul was lost. I seek her, and she flies me; I follow; and the whole Dim woodland echoes with her voice, Soft calling to my soul. III OWL ROOST The slope is a mass of vines: If you walk in the daylight there, A gleam as of twilight shines Through the vines massed everywhere: Each trunk, that a creeper twines, Is a column, strong to bear The dome of its leaves that wave, Cathedral-dim and grave. Black moss makes silent the feet: And, above, the fox-grapes lace So thick that the noonday heat Is chill as a murdered face: And the winds for miles repeat The fugue of a rolling bass: The deep leaves twinkle and turn But over no flower or fern. An angular spider weaves Great webs between the trees, Webs that are witches' sieves: And honey-and bumblebees Go droning among the leaves, Like the fairies' oboÃ«s: At dark the owlets croon To the stars and the sickle-moon. At dark I will not go There where the branches sigh; Where naught but the glow-worms glow, Each one like a demon's eye: O'er which, like a battle-bow, With an arrow that it lets fly, The new-moon and one star Hang and glimmer afar. At dawn, if my mood be dim, And the day be a cloudless one, There where the sad winds hymn I'll walk, but its shade will shun; Its shade, where I feel the grim Horror of something done Here in the years long past, That the place conceals to the last. IV MOSS AND FERN Where rise the brakes of bramble there, Wrapped with the trailing rose, Through cane where waters ramble, there Where deep the green cress grows, Who knows? Perhaps, unseen of eyes of man, Hides Pan. Perhaps the creek, whose pebbles make A foothold for the mint, May bear,âwhere soft its trebles make Confession,âsome vague hintâ (The print, Goat-hoofed, of one who lightly ran)â Of Pan. Where, in the hollow of the hills Ferns deepen to the knees, What sounds are those above the hills, And now among the trees?â No breeze!â The syrinx, haply, none may scan, Of Pan. In woods where waters break upon The hush like some soft word; Where sun-shot shadows shake upon The moss, who has not heardâ No bird!â The flute, as breezy as a fan, Of Pan? Far in, where mosses lay for us Still carpets, cool and plush; Where bloom and branch and ray for us Swoon in the noonday flush, The hush May sound the satyr hoof a span Of Pan. In woods where thrushes sing to us, And brooks dance sparkling heels; Where wild aromas cling to us, And all our worship kneels,â Who steals Upon us, haunch and face of tan, But Pan? V WOODLAND WATERS Through leaves of the nodding trees, Where blossoms sway in the breeze, Pink bag-pipes made for the bees, Whose slogan is droning and drawling: Where the columbine scatters its bells, And the wild bleeding-heart its shells, O'er mosses and rocks of the dells The brook of the forest is falling. You can hear it under the hill When the wind in the wood is still, And, strokes of a fairy drill, Sounds the bill of the yellow-hammer: By the solomon's-seal it slips, Cohosh and the grass that dripsâ Like the words of an Undine's lips, Is the sound of its falls that stammer. I lie in the woods: and the scent Of the honeysuckle is blent With the sound: and a Sultan's tent Is my dream, with the East enmeshÃ©d:â A slave-girl sings; and I hear The languor of lute-strings near, And a dancing-girl of Cashmere In the harem of good Er Reshid. From ripples of Irak lace She flashes the amorous grace Of her naked limbs and her face, While her golden anklets tinkle: Then over mosaic floors Open seraglio doors Of cedar: by twos, by fours,â Like stars that tremble and twinkle,â While the dulcimers sing, unseen, The handmaids come of the Queen 'Neath silvern lamps, one sheen Of jewels of Afrite treasure: And I see the Arabia rise Of the Nights that were rich and wise, Beautiful, dark, in the eyes Of Zubeideh, the Queen of Pleasure. VI THE THORN-TREE The night is sad with silver and the day is glad with gold, And the woodland silence listens to a legend never old, Of the Lady of the Fountain, whom the fairy people know, With her limbs of samite whiteness and her hair of golden glow, Whom the boyish South-wind seeks for and the girlish-stepping rain, Whom the sleepy leaves still whisper men shall never see again; She whose Vivien charms were mistress of the magic Merlin knew, That could change the dew to glow-worms and the glow-worms into dew. There 's a thorn-tree in the forest, and the fairies know the tree, With its branches gnarled and wrinkled as a face with sorcery; But the May-time brings it clusters of a rainy fragrant white, Like the bloom-bright brows of beauty or a hand of lifted light. And all day the silence whispers to the sun-ray of the morn How the bloom is lovely Vivien and how Merlin is the thorn: How she won the doting wizard with her naked loveliness Till he told her demon secrets that but made his magic less. How she charmed him and enchanted in the thorn-tree's thorns to lie Forever with his passion that should never dim or die: And with wicked laughter looking on this thing that she had done, Like a visible aroma lingered sparkling in the sun; How she stooped to kiss the pathos of an elflock of his beard, All in mockery, at parting, and mock pity of his weird: But her magic had forgotten that âwho bends to give a kiss Will bring down the curse upon them of the person whose it isâ: So the silence tells the secret.âAnd at night the fairies see How the tossing bloom is Vivien, who is struggling to be free, In the thorny arms of Merlin, who, forever, is the tree. VII THE HAMADRYAD She stood among the longest ferns The valley held; and in her hand One blossom like the light that burns, Vermilion, o'er a sunset land; And round her hair a twisted band Of pink-pierced mountain-laurel blooms: And darker than dark pools, that stand Below the star-communing glooms, Her eyes beneath her hair's perfumes. I saw the moon-pearl sandals on Her flower-white feet, that seemed too chaste To tread pure gold: and, like the dawn On splendid peaks that lord a waste Of solitude lost gods have graced, Her face: she stood there, faultless-hipped, Bound with the cestused silver,âchased With acorn-cup and crown, and tipped With oak-leaves,âwhence her chiton slipped. Limbs that the gods call loveliness!â The grace and glory of all Greece Wrought in one marble form were less Than her perfection!â'Mid the trees I saw her; and time seemed to cease For meâAnd, lo! I lived my old Greek life again of classic ease, Barbarian as the myths that rolled Me back into the Age of Gold. WRECKAGE I Love and the drift of many dreams, Under the moon of a Florida night, Over the beach with its silvery seams White as a sail is white. Love that entered into two lives Out of the dreams that the nights have borne, Over the waves where the vapor drives, Mists that the stars have torn. Love that welded two hearts and hands There by the sea, 'neath the shell-white moon, Like to the stars and the mists and the sands Setting two lives in tune. Nights of love that one still keeps Sacred;ânights, that the faith of one Heartened there in the treacherous deeps, Under a tropic sun. II Parting he said to her: âLet us be true to them,â All of our dreams, of the night, of the morning: What is our present, its hope, but a clew to them? What is our past but a dream and a warning? Have you considered the life that regretfully Foldeth weak arms to the fate it might master?â Had I been true to my dreams, never fretfully Halted, my future and joy had been faster.â They had come down to the ocean that, bellowing, Boiled on the sand and the shells that were broken; All of the summer was fading and yellowing; Now they must part and their vows had been spoken. It had befallen that heaven was lowering; Over the sea, like the wraith of a wrecker, Clamored the gull; and the mist in the showering East seemed the ghost of a lofty three-decker. Infinite foam; and the boom of the hollowing Breakers that buried the rocks to their shoulders; Battle and boast of the deep in the wallowing World of the waves where the red sunset smoulders. Long was the leap of the foam on the thunderous Beach; and each end of the beach was a flying Fog of the spray: and she said, âLet it sunder us! Still we will love, for love is undying!â Yet, if it comes to the thing he has said to her?â Wreckage and death?âthe love she has given Turned into sorrow?âOh, that was a dread to her! He, like a weed, by the waters far driven! Weeping, her bosom with shudders was shaken as She for a moment hard clung to her sailor, Kissed him andâparted. His boat had been taken; as Paler it grew the woman grew paler. III All day the rain drove, falling Upon the sombre sea; All day, his wet sail hauling, The sailor tacked a-lea; And through the wild rain calling, What was it?âwas it he? At dusk the gull clanged, drifting Above the boiling brine; And, through the wan west sifting, Streamed one red sunset line; And in its wild light shifting, His far sail seemed to shine. All night the wind wailed, sighing Along the wreck-strewn coast; All night the surf, defying, Rolled thunder in and boast; All night she heard a cryingâ The sea? or some lost ghost? IV The balm of the night and the glory, The music and scent of the sea, Are as song to her heart or a story Of the never-to-be. The stars and the night and the whiteness Of foam on the stretch of the sand; Faint foam that is tossed, like the brightness Of a mermaiden's hand. No sail on the ocean; no sailor On shore, and the winds all asleep; And her face in the starlight far paler Than women who weep. A mist on the deep; and the ghostly White moon in the deep of the night; And a light that is neither; that mostly Is shadow not light. No sea-gull, that vanished with gleaming Of wings, in the swing of the spray; Perhaps it was only her dreaming, Or merely a ray Of moonlight; the glimmering essence Of all that is grayest and dimâ But never his face, or his presence That dripped in each limb. And she cried through the night, âLet me perish! O God, let me die of despair! If he whom I love, whom I cherish, Is weltering there!â She seemed but a sea-mist made woman, And he but a sound of the sea Made man where nothing was human, And never would be. V Long he sailed the deep that glasses The face of God and His majesty; Passed the Horn and the Seas of Grasses, Drifting aimlessly. Time went by with its days that ever Burden the hearts of those who be Far away from their love; whom sever Leagues of the shapeless sea. Land at last, whose reefs rolled broken Foam of the balked waves everywhere; Land; one tangle of weeds and oaken Wreck and of rocks laid bare. Here and there the sand stretched livid Leagues of famine, one blinding glare; Crags, o'er which gaunt birds winged vivid, Harsh in the earthquake air. A little cloud in the sunset's splendor; A little cloud that the sunset stains: Night, and a wisp of a moon that, slender, Dreams of the hurricanes. Winds that stride as with sounding sandals; Winds that the tempest has loosed from chains: Light that leaps like a spear he handles, Shaking his thunder-manes. Wrenching the world in wreck asunder, Black rebellion of hell and night; Wrath and roar of the rocks and thunder, Flame and the winds that fight ... Beating the drift and the hush together, Waves and winds that the morn makes white; Calm and peace of the tropic weather After the typhoon's might. Clouds blow by and the storm 's forgotten. Savage coasts where the sea-cow feeds. Wash of weeds and the sea-weeds rotten. And a dead face in the weeds. None to know him or name him brother; Only the savage in feathers and beads; The South-Sea Islander, fitting another Barb in the shaft he speeds. Far away where the sea-gulls gather; Far away where the evening falls, Lone she stands where the wild waves lather, Rolling the sea in walls.â Who shall tell her, the lonely tryster? Tell her of him on whom she calls?â Suns that beat on his face and blister? Stars? or the sea that crawls? VI She dreamed that there, beside the ocean sitting, Alone she watched, when, at her feet, behold! Between the foam-ridge and the sea-gull's flitting, His body rolled. All was not as it was before they parted; She dreamed he had remembered, she forgot; He 'd said he would forget her, angry-hearted, And yet could not. And then it seemed that, had she known, she surely Had given pity when she could not give Her love to him, who loved her madly, purely, And bade him live. And then she dreamed she looked upon the slanted Hulk of a wreck: and high above the wave, Worn of the wind and of the cactus planted, His nameless grave. SIREN SANDS I The rhododendrons bloom and shake Their petals wide and gleam and sway Among palmettoes, by the lake, Beyond the bay. Shores where we watched the eve reveal Her cloudy sanctuaries, while The bay lay lavaed into steel For mile on mile. We watched the purple coast confuse Soft outlines with the graying light; And towards the gulf a vessel lose Itself in night. We saw the sea-gulls dip and soar; The wild-fowl gather past the pier; And from rich skies, as from God's door, Gold far and near. Two foreign seamen passed and we Heard mellow Spanish; like twin stars, Where they lounged smoking, we could see Their faint cigars. Night; and the heavens stained and strewn With stars the waters idealized, Until their light the rising moon Epitomized. Morn; and the pine-wood balms awake; Winds roll the dew-drop from the rose; The wide lake burns; and, on the lake, The ripple glows. Far coasts detach deep purple from The blue horizon, and the day Beholds the sunburnt sailor come And sail away. The bird that slept at dusk, at dawn Awakes again within the thorn.â Sweet was the night to it, now gone; And sweet is morn. II Through halls of columned scarlet, Like some dark queen, the Dusk Trails skirts of myrrh and musk, Hung in each ear, a starlet Gleams,âgems the clouds' gaunt Jinn Guard; and, beneath her chin, The moon, an opal tusk. There lies a ghostly glory Upon the sea and sand; A gleam, as of a hand, Stretched from the realms of story, Of rosy golden ray; Pointing the world the way To some far Fairyland. As fades the west's vermilion Above the distant coasts, The stars come out in hosts; Within the night's pavilion, As flower speaks to flower, Dim hour calls to hour, Pale with the past's sweet ghosts. III Music that melts through moonlight, Faint on the summer breeze; Fireflies, moonlight, and foaming Susurrus of the seas. Music that drifts like perfume, And touches like a hand; Dreams and stars and the ocean, And we alone on the sand. Glimmers and vague reflections, And the white swirl of the foam; Pale on the purple a vessel, And a light that beckons home. And I seem to see the music, On a moonbeam bar that floats, For the music is moonlight magic, And the flies are its golden notes. And I seem to hear one singing Of a brown old coast and sea, Of lives that were filled with passion, And old-world tragedy. And I hear the harsh reef's calling For a noble ship at sea, And the winds of the ocean singing A dirge for the dead to be. Till it seems that I am the pilot, And you are the mermaidÃ©n, Who lures him on to the wrecking And into her arms again. Song Over the hills where the winds are waking All is lone as the soul of me; Over the hills where the stars are shaking, Breton hills by the sea. These were with me to tell me often How she pined in her Croisic home, Winds that sing and the stars that soften Over the miles of foam. Fishers' nets and the sailor faces; Sad salt marshes and granite piers; Brown, loud coast where the long foam racesâ And a parting full of tears. A gray sail's ghost where the autumn lies on Wraiths of the mist and the squall-blown rain; Her dark girl eyes that search the horizon, Grave with a haunting pain. Stars may burn and the wild winds whistle Over the rocks where the sea-gulls raveâ My heart is bleak as the wind-worn thistle Dead on her seaside grave. IV Sad as sad eyes that ache with tears The stars of night shine through the leaves; And shadowy as the Fates' dim shears The weft that twilight weaves. The summer sunset marched long hosts Of gold adown one golden peak, That flamed and fell; and now gray ghosts Of mist the far west streak. They seem the shades of things that weep, Wan things the heavens would conceal; Blood-stained; that bear within them, deep, Red wounds that will not heal. Night comes, and with it storm, that slips Wild angles of the jagged light:â I feel the wild rain on my lips,â A wild girl is the Night. A moaning tremor sweeps the trees; And all the stars are packed with death:â She holds me by the neck and knees, I feel her wild, wet breath. Hell and its hags drive on the rain:â Night holds me by the hair and pleads; Her kisses fall like blows again; My brow is dewed with beads. The thunder plants wild beacons on Each volleying height.âMy soul seems blown Far out to sea. The world is gone, And night and I alone. Tampa, Florida, February, 1893. WAR-TIME SILHOUETTES. I THE BATTLE The night had passed. The day had come, Bright-born, into a cloudless sky: We heard the rolling of the drum, And saw the war-flags fly. And noon had crowded upon morn Ere Conflict shook her red locks far, And blew her brazen battle-horn Upon the hills of War. Noon darkened into duskâone blot Of nightmare lit with hell-born suns;â We heard the scream of shell and shot And booming of the guns. On batteries of belching grape We saw the thundering cavalry Hurl headlong,âiron shape on shape,â With shout and bugle-cry. When dusk had moaned and died, and night Came on, wind-swept and wild with rain, We slept, 'mid many a bivouac light, And vast fields heaped with slain. II IN HOSPITAL Wounded to death he lay and dreamed The drums of battle beat afar, And round the roaring trenches screamed The hell of war. Then woke; and, weeping, spoke one word To the kind nurse who bent above; Then in the whitewashed ward was heard A song of love. The song she sang him when she gave The portrait that he kissed; then sighed, âLay it beside me in the grave!â And smiled and died. III THE SOLDIER'S RETURN A brown wing beat the apple leaves and shook Some blossoms on her hair. Then, note on note, The bird's wild music bubbled. In her book, Her old romance, she seemed to read. No look Betrayed the tumult in her trembling throat. The thrush sang on. A dreamy wind came down From one white cloud of afternoon and fanned The dropping petals on her book and gown, And touched her hair, whose braids of quiet brown Gently she smoothed with one white jeweled hand. Then, with her soul, it seemed, from feet to brow She felt him coming: 't was his heart, his breath That stirred the blossom on the apple bough; His step the wood-thrush warbled to. And now Her cheek went crimson, now as white as death. Then on the dappled page his shadowâyes, Not unexpected, yet her haste assumed Fright's startle; and low laughter did confess His presence there, soft with his soul's caress And happy manhood, where the rambo bloomed. Quickly she rose and all her gladness sent Wild welcome to him. Her his unhurt arm Drew unresisted; and the soldier leant Fond lips to hers. She wept. And so they went Deep in the orchard towards the old brick farm. IV THE APPARITION A day of drought, foreboding rain and wind, As if stern heaven, feeling earth had sinned, Frowned all its hatred. When the evening came, Along the west, from bank on bank unthinned Of clouds, the storm unfurled its oriflamme. Then lightning signaled, and the thunder woke Its monster drums, and all God's torrents broke.â She saw the wild night when the dark pane flashed; Heard, where she stood, the disemboweled oak Roar into fragments when the welkin crashed. Long had she waited for a word. And, lo! Anticipation still would not say âNo:â He has not written; he will come to her; At dawn!âto-night!âHer heart hath told her so; And so expectancy and love aver. She seems to hear his fingers on the paneâ The glass is blurred, she can not see for rain: Is that his horse?âthe wind is never still: And that his cloak?âah, surely that is plain!â A torn vine tossing at the window-sill. She hurries forth to meet him; pale and wet, She sees his face; the war-soiled epaulet; A sabre-scar that bleeds from brow to cheek; And now he smiles, and now their lips have met, And now ... Dear heart, he fell at Cedar Creek! V WOUNDED It was in August that they brought her news Of his bad wounds; the leg that he must lose. And August passed, and when October raised Red rebel standards on the hills that blazed, They brought a haggard wreck; she scarce knew whose, Until they told her, standing stunned and dazed. A shattered shadow of the stalwart lad, The five-months husband, whom his country had Enlisted, strong for war; returning this, Whose broken countenance she feared to kiss, While health's remembrance stood beside him sad, And grieved for that which was no longer his. They brought him on a litter; and the day Was bright and beautiful. It seemed that May In woodland rambles had forgot her path Of season, and, disrobing for a bath, By the autumnal waters of some bay, With her white nakedness had conquered Wrath. Far otherwise she wished it: wind and rain; The sky, one gray commiserative pain; Sleet, and the stormy drift of frantic leaves; To match the misery that each perceives Aches in her hand-clutched bosom, and is plain In eyes and mouth and all her form that grieves. Theirs, a mute meeting of the lips; she stooped And kissed him once: one long, dark side-lock drooped And brushed against the bandage of his breast; With feeble hands he held it and caressed; Then all his happiness in one look grouped, Saying, âNow I am home, I crave but rest.â Once it was love! but then the battle killed All that sweet nonsense of his youth, and filled His heart with sterner passion.âAh, well! peace Must balm its pain with patience; whose surcease Means reconcilement; e'en as God hath willed, With war or peace who shapes His ends at ease.â What else for these but, where their mortal lot Of weak existence drags rent ends, to knot The frail unravel up!âwhile love (afraid Time will increase the burthen on it laid), Seeks consolation, that consoleth not, In toil and prayer, waiting what none evade. VI THE MESSAGE Long shadows toward the east: and in the west A blaze of garnet sunset, wherein rolled One cloud like some great gnarly log of gold; Each gabled casement of the farm seemed dressed In ghosts of roses blossoming manifest. And she had brought his letter there to read, There on the porch, that faced the locust glade; To watch the summer sunset burn and fade, And breathe the twilight scent of wood and weed, Forget all care and her soul's hunger feed. And on his face her fancy mused a while: âDark hair, dark eyes.âAnd now he has a beard Dark as his hair.ââShe smiled; yet almost feared It changed him so she could not reconcile Her heart to that which hid his lips and smile. Then tried to feature, but could only see The beardless man who bent to her and kissed Her and their child and left them to enlist: She heard his horse grind in the gravel: he Waved them adieu and rode to fight with Lee. Now all around her drowsed the hushful hum Of evening insects. And his letter spoke Of love and longings to her: nor awoke One echo of the bugle and the drum, But all their future in one kiss did sum. The stars were thick now; and the western blush Drained into darkness. With a dreamy sigh She rocked her chair.âIt must have been the cry Of infancy that made her rise and rush To where their child slept, and to hug and hush. Then she returned. But now her ease was gone. She knew not what, she felt an unknown fear Press, tightening, at her heart-strings; then a tear Scalded her eyelids, and her cheeks grew wan As helpless sorrow's, and her white lips drawn. With stony eyes she grieved against the skies, A slow, dull, aching agony that knew Few tears, and saw no answer shining to Her silent questions in the stars' still eyes, âWhere Peace delays and where her soldier lies.â They could have told her. Peace was far away, Beyond the field that belched black batteries All the red day. 'Mid picket silences, On woodland mosses, in a suit of gray, Shot through the heart, he by his rifle lay. VII THE WOMAN ON THE HILL The storm-red sun, through wrecks of wind and rain, And dead leaves driven from the frantic boughs, Where, on the hill-top, stood a gaunt, gray house, Flashed wildest ruby on each rainy pane. Then woods grew darker than unburdened grief; And, crimson through the woodland's ruin, streamed The sunset's glareâa furious eye, which seemed Watching the moon rise like a yellow leaf. The rising moon, against which, like despair, High on the hill, a woman, darkly drawn, The wild leaves round her, stood; with features wan, And tattered dress and wind-distracted hair. As still as death, and looking, not through tears, For the young face of one she knows is lost, While in her heart the melancholy frost Gathers of all the unforgotten years. What if she heard to-night a hurrying hoof, Wild as the whirling of the withered leaf, Bring her a more immedicable grief, A shattered shape to live beneath her roof! The shadow of him who claimed her once as wife; Her lover!âno!âthe wreck of all their past Brought back from battle!âBetter to the last A broken heart than heartbreak all her life! MOSBY AT HAMILTON Down Loudon lanes, with swinging reins, And clash of spur and sabre, And bugling of the battle-horn, Six score and eight we rode that morn, Six score and eight of Southern born, All tried in war's hot labor. Full in the sun, at Hamilton, We met the South's invaders; Who, over fifteen hundred strong, 'Mid blazing homes had marched along All night, with Northern shout and song, To crush the rebel raiders. Down Loudon lanes, with streaming manes, We spurred in wild March weather; And all along our war-scarred way The graves of Southern heroes layâ Our guide-posts to revenge that day, As we rode grim together. Old tales still tell some miracle Of Saints in holy writingâ But who shall say why hundreds fled Before the few that Mosby led, Unless it was that even the dead Fought with us then when fighting. While Yankee cheers still stunned our ears, Of troops at Harper's Ferry; While Sheridan led on his Huns, And Richmond rocked to roaring guns, We felt the South still had some sons She would not scorn to bury. THE FEUD Rocks, trees and rocks; and down a mossy stone The murmuring ooze and trickle of a stream Through brambles, where the mountain spring lies lone,â A gleaming cairngorm where the shadows dream,â And one wild road winds like a saffron seam. Here sang the thrush, whose pure, mellifluous note Dropped golden sweetness on the fragrant June; Here cat-and blue-bird and wood-sparrow wrote Their presence on the silence with a tune; And here the fox drank 'neath the mountain moon. Frail ferns and dewy mosses and dark brush,â Impenetrable briers, deep and dense, And wiry bushes;âbrush, that seemed to crush The struggling saplings with its tangle, whence Sprawled out the ramble of an old rail-fence. A wasp buzzed by; and then a butterfly In orange and amber, like a floating flame; And then a man, hard-eyed and very sly, Gaunt-cheeked and haggard and a little lame, With an old rifle, down the mountain came. He listened, drinking from a flask he took Out of the ragged pocket of his coat; Then all around him cast a stealthy look; Lay down; and watched an eagle soar and float, His fingers twitching at his hairy throat. The shades grew longer; and each Cumberland height Loomed, framed in splendors of the dolphin dusk. Around the road a horseman rode in sight; Young, tall, blond-bearded. Silent, grim, and brusque, He in the thicket aimedâQuick, harsh, then husk, The echoes barked among the hills and made Repeated instants of the shot's distress.â Then silenceâand the trampled bushes swayed:â Then silence, packed with murder and the press Of distant hoofs that galloped riderless. LYNCHERS At the moon's down-going, let it be On the quarry hill with its one gnarled tree. The red-rock road of the underbrush, Where the woman came through the summer hush. The sumac high and the elder thick, Where we found the stone and the ragged stick. The trampled road of the thicket, full Of footprints down to the quarry pool. The rocks that ooze with the hue of lead, Where we found her lying stark and dead. The scraggy wood; the negro hut, With its doors and windows locked and shut. A secret signal; a foot's rough tramp; A knock at the door; a lifted lamp. An oath; a scuffle; a ring of masks; A voice that answers a voice that asks. A group of shadows; the moon's red fleck; A running noose and a man's bared neck. A word, a curse, and a shape that swings; The lonely night and a bat's black wings. At the moon's down-going, let it be On the quarry hill with its one gnarled tree. DEAD MAN'S RUN He rode adown the autumn wood, A man dark-eyed and brown; A mountain girl before him stood Clad in a homespun gown. âTo ride this road is death for you! My father waits you there; My father and my brother, tooâ You know the oath they swear.â He holds her by one berry-brown wrist, And by one berry-brown hand; And he hath laughed at her and kissed Her cheek the sun hath tanned. âThe feud is to the death, sweetheart: But forward must I ride.ââ âAnd if you ride to death, sweetheart, My place is by your side.â Low hath he laughed again and kissed And helped her with his hand; And they have galloped into the mist That belts the autumn land. And they had passed by Devil's Den, And come to Dead Man's Run, When in the brush rose up two men, Each with a levelled gun. âDown! down! my sister!â cries the one;â She gives the reins a twirl.â The other shouts, âHe shot my son! And now he steals my girl!â The rifles crack: she will not wail: He will not cease to ride: But, oh! her face is pale, is pale, And the red blood stains her side. âSit fast, sit fast by me, sweetheart! The road is rough to ride!ââ The road is rough by gulch and bluff, And her hair blows wild and wide. âSit fast, sit fast by me, sweetheart! The bank is steep to ride!ââ The bank is steep for a strong man's leap, And her eyes are staring wide. âSit fast, sit fast by me, sweetheart! The Run is swift to ride!ââ The Run is swift with mountain drift, And she sways from side to side. Is it a wash of the yellow moss, Or drift of the autumn's gold, The mountain torrent foams across For the dead pine's roots to hold? Is it the bark of the sycamore, Or peel of the white birch-tree, The mountaineer on the other shore Hath followed and still can see? No mountain moss or leaves, wild rolled, No bark of birchen-gray!â Young hair of gold and a face death-cold The wild stream sweeps away. THE RAID I Far in the forest, where the rude road winds Through twisted briers and weeds, stamped down and caked With mountain mire, the clashing boughs are raked Again with rain whose sobbing frenzy blinds. There is a noise of winds; a gasp and gulp Of swollen torrents; and the sodden smell Of woodland soil, dead treesâthat long since fell Among the mossâred-rotted into pulp. Fogged by the rain, far up the mountain glen, Deep in a cave, an elfish wisp of light; And stealthy shadows stealing through the night With strong, set faces of determined men. II 'Twixt fog and fire, in pomps of chrysoprase, Above vague peaks, the morning hesitates Ere, o'er the threshold of her golden gates, Speeds the wild splendor of her chariot's rays. A gleaming glimmer in the sun-speared mist, A cataract, reverberating, falls: Upon a pine a gray hawk sits and calls, Then soars away no bigger than a fist. Along the wild path, through the oaks and firs,â Rocks, where the rattler coils himself and suns,â Big-booted, belted, and with twinkling guns, The posse marches with its moonshiners. THE BROTHERS Not far from here, it lies beyond That low-hilled belt of woods. We'll take This unused lane where brambles make A wall of twilight, and the blond Brier-roses pelt the path and flake The margin waters of a pond. This is its fenceâor that which was Its fence onceânow, rock rolled from rock, One tangle of the vine and dock, Where bloom the wild petunias; And this its gate, the ragweeds block, Hot with the insects' dusty buzz. Two wooden posts, wherefrom has peeled The weather-blistered paint, still rise; Gaunt thingsâthat groan when some one tries The gate whose hinges, rust-congealed, Snarl open:âon each post still lies Its carven panther with a shield. We enter; and between great rows Of locusts winds a grass-grown road; And at its glimmering end,âo'erflowed With quiet light,âthe white front shows Of an old mansion, grand and broad, With grave, Colonial porticoes. Grown thick around it, dark and deep, The locust trees make one vast hush; Their brawny branches crowd and crush Its very casements, and o'ersweep Its rotting roofs: their tranquil rush Haunts all its spacious rooms with sleep. Still is it called The Locusts; though None lives here now. A tale 's to tell Of some dark thing that here befell; A crime that happened years ago, When past its walls, with shot and shell, The war swept on and left it so. For one black night, within it, shame Made revel, while, all here about, With prayer or curse or battle-shout, Men died and homesteads leapt in flame: Then passed the conquering Northern rout, And left it silent and the same. Why should I speak of what has been? Or what dark part I played in all? Why ruin sits in porch and hall Where pride and gladness once were seen; And why beneath this lichened wall The grave of Margaret is green. Heart-broken Margaret! whose fate Was sadder far than his who won Her handâmy brother Hamiltonâ Or mine, who learned to know too late; Who learned to know, when all was done, And naught I did could expiate. To expiate is still my lot!â And, like the Ancient Mariner, To show to others how things were, And what I am, still helps me blot A little from that crime's red blur, That on my life is branded hot. He was my only brother. She A sister of my brother's friend. They met, and married in the end. And I remember well when he Brought her rejoicing home, the trend Of war moved towards us sullenly. And scarce a year of wedlock when Its red arms tore him from his bride. With lips by hers thrice sanctified He left to ride with Morgan's men. And IâI never could decideâ Remained behind. It happened then. Long days went by. And, oft delayed, A letter came of loving word Scrawled by some camp-fire, sabre-stirred, Or by a pine-knot's fitful aid, When in the saddle, armed and spurred And booted for some hurried raid. Then weeks went by. I do not know How long it was before there came, Blown from the North, the clarion fame Of Morgan, who, with blow on blow, Had drawn a line of blood and flame From Tennessee to Ohio. Then letters ceased; and days went on. No word from him. The war rolled back, And in its turgid crimson track A rumor grew, like some wild dawn, All ominous and red and black, With news of our lost Hamilton. News hinting death or capture. Yet No word was sure; till one day,âfed By us,âsome men rode up who said They 'd been with Morgan and had met Disaster, and that he was dead, My brother.âI and Margaret Believed them. Grief was ours too: But mine was more for her than him: Grief, that her eyes with tears were dim: Grief, that became the avenue For love, who crowned the sombre brim Of death's dark cup with rose-red hue. In sympathy,âunconsciously Though it be given,âI hold, doth dwell The germ of love that time shall swell To blossom. Sooner then in meâ When close relations so befellâ That love should spring from sympathy. Our similar tastes and mutual bents Combined to make us intimates From our first meeting. Different states Of interest then our temperaments Begot. Then friendship, that abates No love, whose soul it represents. These led to talks and dreams: how oft We sat at some wide window while The sun sank o'er the hills' far file, Serene; and of the cloud aloft Made one vast rose; and mile on mile Of firmament grew sad and soft. And all in harmony with these Dim clemencies of dusk, afar Our talks and dreams went; while the star Of evening brightened through the trees: We spoke of home; the end of war; We dreamed of life and love and peace. How on our walks, in listening lanes Or confidences of the wood, We paused to hear the dove that cooed; Or gathered wildflowers, taking pains To find the fairest; or her hood Filled with wild fruit that left deep stains. No echo of the drum or fife, No hint of conflict entered in Our thoughts then. Will you call it sinâ Indifference to a nation's strife? What side might lose, what side might win, Both immaterial to our life. Into the past we did not look: Beyond what was we did not dream; While onward rolled the thunderous stream Of war, that, in its torrent, took One of our own. No crimson gleam Of its wild course around us shook. At last we knew. And when we learned How he had fallen, Margaret Wept; and, albeit my eyes were wet, Within my soul I half discerned A joy that mingled with regret, A grief that to relief was turned. As time went on and confidence Drew us more strongly each to each, Why did no intimation reach Its warning hand into the dense Soul-silence, and confuse the speech Of love's unbroken eloquence! But, no! no hint to turn the poise, Or check the impulse of our youth; To chill it with the living truth As with the awe of God's own voice; No hint, to make our hope uncouth; No word, to warn us from our choice. To me a wall seemed overthrown That social law had raised between; And o'er its ruin, broad and green A path went, I possessed alone; The sky above seemed all serene; The land around seemed all my own. What shall I say of Margaret To justify her part in this? That her young heart was never his? But had been mine since first we met? So would you say!âEnough it is That when he left she loved him yet. So passed the spring, and summer sped; And early autumn brought the day When she her hand in mine should lay, And I should take her hand and wed: And still no hint that might gainsay, No warning word of quick or dead. The day arrived; and with it born, A battle, sullying the East With boom of cannon, that increased, And throb of musket and of horn: Until at last, towards dusk, it ceased; And men with faces wild and worn, In fierce retreat, swept past; now groups; Now one by one: now sternly white, Or blood-stained; now with looks whose fright Said all was lost: then sullen troops That, beaten, still kept up the fight.â Then came the victors: shadowy loops Of men and horse, that left a crowd Of officers in hall and porch. ... While through the land, around, the torch Circled, and many a fiery cloud Marked out the army's iron march In furrows red that pillage plowed, Here were we wedded. ... Ask the years How such could be, while over us A sword of wrath swung ominous, And on our cheeks its breath struck fierce!â All I remember isâ't was thus; And Margaret's eyes were wet with tears. No other cause my memory sees Save this, that night was set; and when I found my home filled with armed men With whom were all my sympathies Of Unionâwhy postpone it then? So argued conscience into peace. And then it was, when night had passed, There came to me an orderly With word of a Confederate spy Just taken; who, with head downcast, Had asked one favor, this: âThat I Would see him ere he breathed his last.â I stand alone here. Heavily My thoughts go back. Had I not gone, The dead had still been dead! (for none Had yet believed his story) he, My dead-deemed brother, Hamilton, Who in the spy confronted me. O you who never have been tried, How can you judge me!âIn my place I saw him standing,âwho can trace My heart-thoughts then!âI turned aside, A son of some unnatural race, And did not speak: and so he died. ... In hospital or prison, when It was he lay; what had forbid His home return so long: amid What hardships he had suffered, then I dared not ask; and when I did, Long afterwards, inquire of men, No thing I learned. But this I feelâ He who had so returned to life Was not a spy. Through stress and strife,â This makes my conscience hard to heal!â He had escaped: he sought his wife; He sought his home that should conceal. And Margaret! Oh, pity her! A criminal I sought her side, Still thinking love was justified In all for herâwhatever were The price: a brother thrice denied, Or thrice a brother's murderer. Since then long years have passed away. And through those years, perhaps, you'll ask How to the world I wore my mask Of honesty?âI can but say Beyond my powers it was a task; Before my time it turned me gray. And when at last the ceaseless hiss Of conscience drove, and I betrayed All to her, she knelt down and prayed: Then rose: and 'twixt us an abyss Was opened; and she seemed to fade Out of my life: I came to miss The sweet attentions of a bride: For each appealing heart's caress In me her heart assumed a dress Of dull indifference; till denied To me was all responsiveness; And then I knew her love had died. Ah, had she loaded me, perchance, With wild reproach or even hate, Such would have helped me hope and wait Forgiveness and returned romance: But 'twixt our souls, instead, a gate She closed of silent tolerance. Yet, 't was for love of her I lent My soul to crime. ... I question me Often, if less entirely I'd loved her, then, in that event She had been justified to see The deed alone stand prominent. The deed alone! But love records In his own heart, I will aver, No depth I did not feel for her Beyond the plummet-reach of words: And though there may be worthier, No truer love this world affords Than mine was, though it could not rise Above itself. And so 't was best, Perhaps, that she saw manifest The crime, so I,âas saw her eyes,â Might see; and so, in soul confessed, Some life atonement might devise. Sadly my heart one comfort keeps, That, towards her end, she took my hands And said,âas one who understands,â âHad I but seen!âBut love that weeps Sees only as its loss commands.â And sighed.âBeneath this stone she sleeps. Yes; I have suffered for that sin: Yet in no instance would I shun What I should suffer. Many a one, Who heard my tale, has tried to win Me to believe that Hamilton It was not; and, though proven kin, This had not saved him. Still the stain Of the intentionâhad I erred And 't was not heâhad writ the word Red on my soul that branded Cain: For still my error had incurred The fact of guilt that would remain. Ah, love at best is insecure, And lives with doubt and vain regret; And hope and faith, with faces set Upon the past, are never sure; And through their fever, grief, and fret The heart may fail that should endure. For in ourselves, however blend The passions that make heaven and hell, Is evil not accountable For most the good we comprehend? And through these two,âor ill, or well,â Man must evolve his spiritual end. It is with deeds that we must ask Forgiveness: for, upon this earth, Life walks alone from very birth With death, hope tells us is a mask For life beyond of vaster worth, Where sin no more sets love a task. [POEMS OF LOVE] EPILOGUE Would I could sing of joy I only Remember as without alloy: Of life full-filled, that once was lonely: Of love a treasure, not a toy: Of grief, regret but makes the keener, Of aspiration, failure marsâ These would I sing, and sit serener Than song among the stars. Would I could sing of faith unbroken; Of heart-kept vows, and not of tears: Of promised faith and vows love-spoken, That have been kept through many years: Of truth, the false but leaves the truer; Of trust, the doubt makes doubly sureâ These would I sing, the noble doer Whose dauntless heart is pure. I would not sing of time made hateful; Of hope that only clings to hate: Of charity, that grows ungrateful; And pride that will not stand and wait.â Of humbleness, care hath imparted; Of resignation, born of ills, These would I sing, and stand high-hearted As hope upon the hills. Once on a throne of gold and scarlet I touched a harp and felt it break; I dreamed I was a kingâa varlet, A slave, who only slept to wake!â Still on that harp my memory lingers, While on a tomb I lean and read, âDust are our songs, and dust we singers, And dust are all who heed.â [What though I dreamed of mountain heights] What though I dreamed of mountain heights, Of peaks, the barriers of the world, Around whose tops the Northern Lights And tempests are unfurled! Mine are the footpaths leading through Life's lowly fields and woods,âwith rifts, Above, of heaven's Eden blue,â By which the violet lifts Its shy appeal; and, holding up Its chaliced gold, like some wild wine, Along the hillside, cup on cup, Blooms bright the celandine. Where soft upon each flowering stock The butterfly spreads damask wings; And under grassy loam and rock The cottage cricket sings. Where overhead eve blooms with fire, In which the new moon bends her bow, And, arrow-like, one white star by her Burns through the afterglow. I care not, so the sesame I find; the magic flower there, Whose touch unseals each mystery In water, earth, and air. That in the oak tree lets me hear Its heart's deep speech, its soul's dim words; And to my mind makes crystal clear The messages of birds. Why should I care, who live aloof Beyond the din of life and dust, While dreams still share my humble roof, And love makes sweet my crust. GERTRUDE When first I gazed on Gertrude's face, Beheld her loveliness and grace; Her brave gray eyes, her raven hair, Her ways, more winsome than the spring's; Her smile, like some sweet flower, that flings Its fragrance on the summer air; And when, like some wild-bird that sings, I heard her voice,âI did declare,â And still declare!âthere is no one, No girl beneath the moon or sun, So beautiful to look upon! And to my heart, as I know well, Nothing seems more desirable,â Not Ophir gold, nor Orient pearlsâ Than seems this jewel-girl of girls. LOVE For him, who loves, each mounting morn Breathes melody more sweet than birds'; And every wind-stirred flower and thorn Whispers melodious words:â Would you believe that everything Through her loved voice is made to sing? For her, the faultless skies of day Grow nearer in eternal blue, Where God is felt as wind and ray, And seen as fire and dew:â Would you believe that all the skies Are Heaven only through his eyes? For them, the dreams that haunt the night With mystic beauty and romance, Are presences of starry light, And moony radiance:â Would you believe this love of theirs Could make for them a universe? HEART OF MY HEART I Here where the season turns the land to gold, Among the fields our feet have known of old,â When we were children who would laugh and run, Glad little playmates of the wind and sun,â Before came toil and care and years went ill, And one forgot and one remembered still; Heart of my heart, among the old fields here, Give me your hands and let me draw you near, Heart of my heart. II Stars are not truer than your soul is true; What need I more of heaven then than you? Flowers are not sweeter than your face is sweetâ What need I more to make my world complete? O woman nature, love that still endures, What strength hath ours that is not born of yours? Heart of my heart, to you, whatever come, To you the lead, whose love hath led me home. Heart of my heart. STROLLERS I We have no castles, We have no vassals, We have no riches, no gems and no gold: Nothing to ponder; Nothing to squanderâ Let us go wander As minstrels of old. II You with your lute, love; I with my flute, love, Let us make music by mountain and sea: You with your glances, I with my dances, Singing romances Of old chivalry. III âDerry down derry! Good folk, be merry! Hither! and hearken where happiness is! Never go borrow Care of to-morrow, Never go sorrow While life hath a kiss!â IV Let the day gladden, Or the night sadden, We will be merry in sunshine or snow: You with your rhyme, love, I with my chime, love, We will make Time, love, Dance as we go. V Nothing is ours; Only the flowers, Meadows, and stars, and the heavens above: Nothing to lie for, Nothing to sigh for, Nothing to die for While still we have love. VI âDerry down derry! Good folk, be merry! Hither! and hearken a word that is sooth:â Care ye not any, If ye have many, Or not a penny, If still ye have youth!â THE BURDEN OF DESIRE I In some dim way I know thereof: A garden glows down in my heart, Wherein I meet and often part With many an ancient tale of love. A Romeo garden, banked with bloom, And trellised with the eglantine; In which a rose climbs to a room, A balcony one mass of vine, Dim, haunted of perfume. A balcony, whereon she gleams, The soft Desire of all Dreams, And smiles and bends like Juliet, Year after year, While to her side, all dewy wet, A rose stuck in his ear, Love climbs to draw her near. II And in another way I know, Down in my soul a graveyard lies, Wherein I meet, in ghostly wise, With many an ancient tale of woe. A graveyard of the Capulets, Deep-vaulted with ancestral gloom, Through whose dark yews the moonlight jets On many a wildly carven tomb, That mossy mildew frets. A graveyard where the Soul's Desire Sleeps, pale-entombed; and, kneeling by her, Love, like that hapless Montague, Year after year, Weary and worn and wild of hue, Within her sepulchre, Falls bleeding on her bier. THE TRYST At dusk there fell a shower: The leaves were dripping yet: Each fern and rain-weighed flower Around was gleaming wet, When, through the evening glower, His feet towards her were set. The dust's damp odor sifted Around him, cool with rain, Mixed with the musk that drifted From woodland and from plain, Where white her garden lifted Its pickets down the lane. And there she stood! 'mid scattered Clove-pink and pea and whorl Of honeysuckle,âflattered To sweetness wild,âa girl, O'er whom the clouds hung shattered In moonlit peaks of pearl. She made the night completer For him; and earth and air, In that small spot, far sweeter Than heaven or anywhere.â Swift were his lips to greet her, Her lips love lifted there. GYPSYING Your heart's a-tune with April and mine a-tune with June, So let us go a-roving beneath the summer moon. Oh, was it in the sunlight, or was it in the rain, We met among the blossoms within the locust lane? All that I can remember 's the bird that sang aboon, And with its music in our hearts we'll rove beneath the moon. A love-word of the wind, dear, of which we'll read the rune, While we two go a-roving beneath the summer moon. A love-word of the water we'll often stop to hearâ The echoed words and whispers of our own hearts, my dear. And all our paths shall blossom with wild-rose sweets that swoon, And with their fragrance in our hearts we'll rove beneath the moon. It will not be forever; yet merry goes the tune While we two still are rovers beneath the summer moon. A cabin, in the clearing, of flickering firelight, When old-time lanes we strolled in the winter snows make white: Where we can dream together above the logs and croon The songs we sang when roving beneath the summer moon. UNCERTAINTY ââHe cometh not,â she said.ââ Mariana. It will not be to-day and yet I think and dream it will; and let The slow uncertainty devise So many sweet excuses, met With the old doubt in hope's disguise. The panes were sweated with the dawn; Yet through their dimness, shriveled drawn, The aigret of one princess-feather, One monk's-hood tuft with oilets wan, I glimpsed, dead in the slaying weather. This morning when my window's chintz I drew, how gray the day was!âSince I saw him, yea, all days are gray!â I gazed out on my dripping quince, Defruited, torn; then turned away To weep, but did not weep: but felt A colder anguish than did melt About the tearful-visaged Year!â Then flung the lattice wide and smelt The autumn sorrow. Rotting near The rain-drenched sunflowers bent and bleached, Up which the frost-nipped gourd-vines reached And morning-glories, seeded o'er With ashen aiglets; whence beseeched One last bloom, frozen to the core. The podded hollyhocksâthat Fall Had stripped of fineryâby the wall Rustled their tatters; dripped and dripped, The fog thick on them: near them, all The tarnished, hag-like zinnias tipped. I felt the death and loved it: yea, To have it nearer, sought the gray, Chill, fading garth. Yet could not weep, But wandered in an aimless way, And yearned with weariness to sleep. Mine were the fog, the frosty stalks, The weak lights on the leafy walks, The shadows shivering with the cold; The breaking heart; the lonely talks; The last, dim, ruined marigold. But when, to-night, the moon swings lowâ A great marsh-marigold of glowâ And all my garden with the sea Moans, then, through moon and mist, I know His ghost will come to comfort me. LOST LOVE I loved her madly. Forâso wrought Young Love, divining Isles of Truth Large in the central seas of Youthâ âLove will win love,â I thought. Once when I brought a rare wild pink To place among her plants, the wise, Soft lifting of her speaking eyes Said more than thanks, I think. ... She loved another.âYes, I know All you would say of woman. You, Like other men, would comfort too. ... But then I loved her so. She loved another.âAh! too well I know the story of her soul!â A weary tale the weary whole Of how she loved and fell. I loved her so! ... Remembering now My mad grief then, I wonder why Grief never kills. ... I could not die.â She diedâI know not how. Strange, is it not? For she was dear To me as life once.âA regret She is now; just to make eyes wet And bring a fullness here. Yet, had she lived as dead in shame As now in death, Love would have used Pride's pitying pencil and abused The memory of her name. This helps me thank my God, who led My broken life in sunlight of This pure affection, that my love Lives through her being dead. OVERSEAS Non numero horas nisi serenas. When fall drowns morns in mist, it seems In soul I am a part of it; A portion of its humid beams, A form of fog, I seem to flit From dreams to dreams. An old chateau sleeps 'mid the hills Of France: an avenue of sorbs Conceals it: drifts of daffodils Bloom by a 'scutcheoned gate with barbs Like iron bills. I pass the gate unquestioned, yet, I feel, announced. Broad holm-oaks make Dark pools of restless violet. Between high bramble banks a lake,â As in a net The tangled scales twist silver,âshines ... Gray, mossy turrets swell above A sea of leaves. And where the pines Shade ivied walls, there lies my love, My heart divines. I know her window, dimly seen From distant lanes with hawthorn hedged: Her garden, with the nectarine Espaliered, and the peach-tree, wedged 'Twixt walls of green. Cool-babbling a fountain falls From gryphons' mouths in porphyry; Carp haunt its waters; and white balls Of lilies dip it that the bee Sucks in and drawls. And butterflies, each with a face Of faÃ«ry on its wings, that seem Beheaded pansies, softly chase Each other down the gloom and gleam Trees interspace. And roses! roses, soft as vair, Round sylvan statues and the old Stone dialâPompadours that wear Their royalty of purple and gold With queenly air. ... Her scarf, her lute, whose ribbons breathe The perfume of her touch; her gloves, Modeling the daintiness they sheathe; Her fan, a Watteau, gay with loves, Lie there beneath A bank of eglantines that heaps A rose-strewn shadow.âNaÃ¯ve-eyed, With lips as suave as they, she sleeps; The romance by her, open wide, O'er which she weeps. AT THE STILE Young Harry leapt over the stile and kissed her, Over the stile when the sun was sinking; 'T was only Carrie; just Mary's sister!â And love hath a way of thinking. âThy pail, sweetheart, I will take and carry.â Over the stile one star hung yellow.â âJust to the spring, my dearest Harry.ââ And Love is a heartless fellow. âThou saidst me âyeaâ in an April shower Under this tree with leaves a-quiver.ââ âI say thee nay now the cherry 's in flower, And love is taker and giver.â âO false! thou art false to me, sweetheart!ââ The light in her eyes grew trist and trister: âTo thee, the stars, and myself, sweetheart, I never was aught but Mary's sister. âSweet Mary's sister! just little Carrie!â But what avail my words or weeping?â Next month, perhaps, you two will marryâ And I in my grave be sleeping.â Alone she stands 'mid the meadow millet, Wan as the petals the wind is strewing: Some tears in her pail as she stoops to fill itâ And love hath a way of doing. FERN-SEED âWe have the receipt of fern-seed; we walk invisible.ââ Henry IV. And you and I have met but thrice!â Three times enough to make me love!â I praised your hair once; then your glove; Your eyes; your gownâyou were like ice. And yet this might suffice, my love, And yet this might suffice. I know now what it is I'll do: I'll search and find the ferns that grow The fern-seed that the fairies know, And sprinkle fern-seed in my shoe, And haunt the steps of you, my dear, And haunt the steps of you. You'll see the poppy-pods dip here, The blow-ball of the thistle slip, And no wind breathingâbut my lip Next to your anxious cheek and ear, To tell you I am near, my love, To tell you I am near. On wood-ways I will tread your gownâ You'll know it is no brier!âthen I'll whisper words of love again, And smile to see your quick face frown; And then I'll kiss it down, my dear, And then I'll kiss it down. You'll sit at home and read or knit, When suddenly the page is blottedâ My hands!âor all your needles knotted: And in your rage you'll cry a bit: But IâI'll laugh at it, my love, But IâI'll laugh at it. The secrets which you say at prayer I too will hear; or, when you sing, I too will sing, and whispering Bend down and kiss your eyes and hair, And you will know me there, my dear, And you will know me there. Would it were true what people say!â Would I could find that faÃ«ry seed! Then would I win your love, indeed, By being near you night and day:â There is no other way, my love, There is no other way. PORPHYROGENITA I Was it when Kriemhild was queen That we rode by ways forgotten Through the Rhineland, dimly seen 'Neath a low moon white as cotton? I, a knight? or troubadour? Thou, a princess?âor a poor Damsel of the Royal Closes?â For, I met theeâsomewhere sure! ... Was it 'mid Kriemhilda's roses? II Or in Venice, by the sea?â What romance grew up between us? Thou, a doge's daughter?âShe, Titian painted once as Venus?â I, a gondolier whose barque Glided past thy palace dark?â Near St. Mark's? or Casa d'Oro?â From thy casement didst thou hark To my barcarolle's âTe oroâ? III Klaia wast, of Egypt: yea, Languid as its sacred lily. Didst with me a year and day Love upon the Isle of PhilÃ¦? I, a priest of Isis?âSweet, 'Neath the date-palms did we meet By a temple's pillared marble? While, from its star-still retreat, Sank the nightingale's wild warble? IV Have I dreamed that I, thy slave, From thy lattice, my sultana, Beckoning, thy white hand did wave, Dropped me once a rose? sweet manna Of thy kiss warm in its heart? That, through my ChaldÃ¦an art, With thy Khalif's bags of treasure, From Damascus we did start, Fled to some far land of pleasure? V Was I one? another thou?â Let it be. What of it, dearest?â Haply 'tis the memory now Of these passions dead thou fearest?â Nay! those loves are portions of, Evolutions of this love, Present love, where thou appearest To combine them all and prove. THE CASTLE OF LOVEHe speaks I Now listen! 'tis time that you knew it.â Like the prince in the Asian tale, I wandered on deserts that panted With noon to a castle enchanted, That Afrits had built in a vale; A vale where the sunlight lay pale As moonlight. And round it and through it I searched and I searched. Like the tale, II No eunuch, black-browed as a Marid, Prevented me. Shadows it seemed Were the slaves there, with kohl and with hennÃ© In eyes and on fingers; and many The phantoms of beauty, that dreamed Where censers of ambergris steamed. And I came on a colonnade, quarried From silvery marble it seemed. III And here, in a court, wide, estraded, Rich tulips, like carbuncles, bloomed, And jonquils and roses:âand lories, And cockatoos, brilliant in glories Of plumes, like great blossoms illumed, Winged, splashed in a fountain perfumed: Kept captive by network of braided, Spun gold where stone galleries gloomed. IV From nipples of back-bending Peris Of gold, glowing auburn, in rays The odorous fountain sprang calling: I heard through the white water's falling,â As soft as the zephyr that plays With moonlight on bloom-haunted ways,â A music; a sound, as if fairies Touched wind-harps whose chords were of rays. V I followed: through corridors paneled With sandal; through doorways deep-draped With stuffs of ChosroÃ«s, rich-garded With Indian gold; up the corded Stone stairway, bronze-dragoned, wing-shaped: Through moon-spangled hangings escapedâ 'Twixt pillars of juniper channeledâ To a room constellated and draped. VI As in legends of witchcraft: a vassal Of visions beholds naught yet hears Sweet voices that call and he follows,â So me, like the fragrance of aloes, That chamber with song, it appears, Surrounded; the song of the spheres ... My soul found your soul such a castleâ Your love is the music it hears. CONSECRATIONShe speaks Last night you told me, where we, parting, waited, Of love somehow I'd known before you told.â Long, long ago, perhaps, this love was fated, For why was it made suddenly so old? Is it because the love we have and cherish Born with us seems, and as ourselves shall last? Part of our lives, we can not let it perish Out of our present's future or its past? Yet, all was changed; and, still, I did not wonder That, robed in vaster splendor, broke the dawn: Nor marvel that, beside my feet and under, Each flower seemed fairer than the flower gone. The wild bird's silvery warble seemed completer; A whiter magic filled the morn and noon, And nightâeach night!âseemed holier grown and sweeter With Babylonian witchcraft of the moon.â Is love an emanation? whose ideal Communicates its beauty?âIs it moved Through some strange means to consecrate the real? Making the world the worthier to be loved? ROMANTIC LOVE I Is it not sweet not know?â The moon hath told me soâ That in some lost romance, love, Long lost to us below, A knight with casque and lance, love, A thousand years ago, I kissed you from a trance, love?â The moon hath told me so. II Or were it strange to wis?â The stars have told me thisâ That once a nightingale, love, Sang on an Isle of Greece; From whose melodious wail, love, Its song's wild harmonies, Was born a spirit-womanâ Yourself! whom I, a human, Made mine! ... So goes the tale, love!â The stars have told me this. III Is it not quaint to tell?â The flowers remember wellâ How once a wild-rose blew, love, Dim in a haunted dell; To which a bee was true, love. The bee, so it befell, Was I: the rose was you, love! ... The flowers remember well. IV To moon and flower and star We are not what we are.â Sometimes, from o'er that sea, love, Whose golden sands are far,â From shores of Destiny, love,â The dreams that know no bar, Will waft a truth that glistens To Memory who listens, Reminding you and me, love, We are not what we are. PASTORAL LOVE The pied pinks tilt in the wind that worriesâ Sing, Oh, the wind and the red o' her cheek!â And the slow sun creeps on the rye nor hurriesâ And what shall a lover speak? The toad-flax brightens the flaxen hollowsâ Sing, Ay, the bloom and her yellow hair!â And the greenwood brook a wood-way followsâ And what shall a lover dare? The deep woods gleam that the sunlight sprinklesâ Sing, Hey, the day and her laughing eye!â And a brown bird pipes and a wild fall tinklesâ And what may a maid reply? Hey, the hills when the evening settles! Oh, the heavens within her eyes! What will he ask 'mid the dropping petals? And what will she say with sighs?â âLook, where the west is a blur of roses!ââ âThere's naught like the rose o' the cheeks I see!ââ âLook, where the first star's eye uncloses!ââ âBut what of your eyes, my destiny?â ANDALIA AND THE SPRINGTIME I Blow, winds, and waken her! You, who have taken her, Never forsaken her, Filled her with spring! My mad and merriest Part of the veriest Season and cheeriest: Blow, winds! and sing, Birds of the spring! that taught her Airs of the woods; this daughter Wild of the winds, that waft her Into my heart with laughter, Wild as a wildwood thing. II She, who is fraught with it, Thrilled with it, brought with it, Spring!âlike a thought, with it Beautiful too! Now like a dream of it; Filled with the gleam of it; Now a bright beam of it, Piercing me through, Sweet, with her eyes that are often Laughter and languor; that soften Dreamily, drowsily, slowly, Then, on a sudden, are wholly Dancing as dew. III Face,âlike the sweetest of Perfumes,âcompletest of Flowers God's fleetest of Months ever bear!â Listen, O lisper wind,â Lighter and crisper wind,â Have you a whisper, wind, Soft as her hair? Night and the stars did spin it; Darkness and brightness are in it: Let but a ray of it bind me, Wrap it around me and wind me, Blind as the blind are and blinder, Yet through my heart would I find her, Lost though I were. OLIVIA IN THE AUTUMN Not redder than her lips This weather! Not rosier two rose-hips Together! As she comes carolling Down wildwood ways, where sing The birds, and flowers swing In many a feather. Of her belovÃ©d cheeks October Makes flame-flushed leaves, and speaks,â Now sober, Now wild,âits happiness In gold, and on her dress Lays many a bright caress As if to robe her. The wild-birds praise her eyes Each hour; Above her bend the skies And shower Around her, there and here, Strays of the passing year, Azure and gold and sere Of weed and flower. The wood-winds kiss her hair And wonder What flower blossoms there: And, under Its deeps of acorn-brown, Her glory and her crown, The sunbeams lay them down, And dream and ponder. And IâI take her hands, Her lover; And kiss her where she stands; And over Our heads the soft winds call, And heav'n smiles down; and all The golden dreams of Fall Around us hover. SYLVIA OF THE WOODLAND I O you, who know our Mays that blow The bluets by the ways; The Indian-pink,âwhose bloom you 'd think Was blood for some wild bee to drink,â Howâcan you sayâin their wise way Is it you 're like our Mays?â In gleam and gloom and wild perfume Of moods that run from shade to sun:â While in you seems the light that dreams In thoughts of other days. II Meseems some song, for which I long, From you to me takes wing Each time you speak; a bird, whose beak Is in my heart; whose wildwood art Makes every beat say âSweet, sweet, sweet,â And all its pulses sing. And when I gaze upon your face, I seem to look into a brook, That laughs through buds and leafing woods, Reflecting all the spring. III You spoke but nowâand, lo! I vow, From haunts of hart and hind I seemed to hear Romance draw near, White hand in hand with Song, and stand, In some green aisle of wood, and smile, Beguiling soul and mind: You laughâand, lo! I seem to go In Mirth's young train; and bird-songs rain Around, above; and Joy and Love Come dancing down the wind. WITNESSES I You say I do not love you!âTell me why, When I have gazed a little on your face, And then gone forth into the world of men, A beauty, neither of the earth nor sky, A glamour, that transforms each common place, Attends my spirit then? II You say I do not love you!âYet, I know, When I have heard you speak and dwelt upon Your words a while, my heart has gone away Filled with strange music, very soft and low, A dim companion, touching with sweet tone The discords of the day. III You say I do not love you!âYet, it seems, When I have kissed your hand and said farewell, A fragrance, wilder than the wood's wild bloom, Companions dim my soul and fills, with dreams, The sad and sordid streets where people dwell, Dreams of spring's wild perfume. A PUPIL OF PAN My love's adorable and wise As heaven and the winds of spring: Go thou and gaze into her eyesâ Such scholars of the starry skies! âCanst marvel at the thing? My love is like a bud that blows With fragrant honey in its heart: Go, watch her smileâWouldst not suppose She from some warm, white, serious rose Had learned the happy art? The thoughts she speaks are pearls unstrung That strew her fancy's golden floor: Go listenâFor, the woods among, She met with Pan, when very young, Who taught her all his lore. LORA OF THE VALES Lora is her name that slips Soft as love between the lips: You must know she is so wise All she does is lift her eyes,â Larkspur-blue as April skies,â At her nameâand that repliesâ She 's so wise, is Lora. Lora is her name whose sound Hedges all my heart around With the gold of happiness: When she speaks, you will confess, Music's self her words express, Every vowel a caressâ She 's so kind, is Lora. Lora is her name that brings Thoughts to me of morning things: Songs of birds; of bees that creep In the rumpled bluebells deep; Butterflies, that, half asleep, On some rose their vigil keepâ She 's so young, is Lora. Lora, lean to mine your face; So; and round you let me lace One firm arm, and gently woo Your small mouth, as fresh as dew, Till it says your heart is true, True to me as mine to you, Sunny-hearted Lora! PLEDGES I What the May-apple or Woodland anemoneâ Star-perfect as a starâ Says to the honey-bee: Or to the winds that woo, Filling their hearts with dew: What says the bluet's blue To the sun's rayâdo you Know or do I?â II Listen, and you may hear What the oxalis says Into the downy ear Of the pale moth that sways There on its heart and drinks: Or what the forest-pinks Say to the dew that winks, Butterfly-wing that blinksâ Glimmering by. III They say: âWhen April trod By in a blowing blush,â Wise as a word of God Holding all Heaven a-hush,â Singing a song of love, We, as she passed above, Sprang from the notes thereof, Filling with joy each grove, Beauty and mystery.â ORIENTAL ROMANCE I Beyond lost seas of summer she Dwelt on an island of the sea, Last scion of that dynasty, Queen of a race forgotten long,â With eyes of light and lips of song, From seaward groves of blowing lemon, She called me in her native tongue, Low-leaned on some rich robe of Yemen. II I was a king. Three moons we drove Across green gulfs, the crimson clove And cassia spiced, to claim her love. Packed was my barque with gums and gold; Rich fabrics; sandalwood, grown old With odor; gems; and pearls of Oman,â Than her white breasts less white and cold;â And myrrh, less fragrant than this woman. III From Bassora I came. We saw Her condor castle on a claw Of soaring precipice, o'erawe The surge and thunder of the spray: Like some great opal, far away It shone, with battlement and spire, Wherefrom, with wild aroma, day Blew splintered lights of sapphirine fire. IV Lamenting caverns, dark and deep, That catacombed the haunted steep, Led upward to her castle-keep ... Fair as the moon, whose light is shed In Ramadan, was she, who led My love unto her island bowers, To find her ... lying young and dead Among her maidens and her flowers. THE TOLLMAN'S DAUGHTER She stood waist-deep among the briers: Above, in twisted lengths, were rolled The sunset's tangled whorls of gold, Blown from the west's cloud-pillared fires. And in the hush, no sound did mar, You almost heard, o'er hill and dell, Deep, bubbling over, star on star, The night's blue cisterns slowly well. A crane, a shadowy crescent, crossed The sunset, winging 'thwart the west; While up the east her silver breast Of light the moon brought, white as frost. So have I painted her, you see, The tollman's daughter.âWhat an arm And throat were hers! and what a form! âArt dreams of such divinity. What braids of night to smooth and kiss!â There is no pigment anywhere A man might use to picture thisâ The splendor of her raven hair. A face as beautiful and bright, As rosy fair as twilight skies, Lit with the stars of hazel eyes And eyebrowed black with penciled night. For her, I know, where'er she trod Each dewdrop raised a looking-glass, To catch her image, from the grass; That wildflowers bloomed along the sod, And whispered perfume when she smiled; The wood-bird hushed to hear her song, Or, heart-enamoured, tame though wild, Before her feet flew fluttering long: The brook went mad with melody, Eddied in laughter when she kissed With naked feet its amethystâ And Iâshe was my world, ah me! CREOLE SERENADE Under moss-draped oak and pine, Murmuring, falls the fountained stream; In its pool the lilies shine, Silvery, each a glimmering gleam. Roses bloom and roses die In the warm rose-scented dark, Where the firefly, like an eye, Winks and glows, a golden spark. Amber-belted through the night Drifts the alabaster moon, Like a big magnolia white On the fragrant heart of June. With a broken syrinx there, With bignonia overgrown, Is it Pan in hoof and hair?â Or his image carved from stone? See! her casement's jessamines part;â Through their stars and swooning scent Like the moon she leans. O heart, 'T is another firmament! Sings: The dim verbena drugs the dusk With lemon odors; everywhere Wan heliotropes breathe drowsy musk Into the jasmine-heavy air; The moss-rose bursts its dewy husk And spills its attar there. The orange at thy casement flings Star-censers oozing rich perfumes; The clematis, long-petaled, swings Deep clusters of dark purple blooms; With flowers, like moons or sylphide wings, Magnolias light the glooms. Awake, awake from sleep! Thy balmy hair, Unbounden, deep on deep, Like blossoms there,â That dew and fragrance weep,â Will fill the night with prayer. Awake, awake from sleep! And dreaming here it seems to me A dryad's bosom grows confessed, Nude in the dark magnolia tree, That rustles with the murmurous Westâ Or is it but some bloom I see, White as thy virgin breast? Through Southern heavens above are rolled A million feverish stars, that burst, Like gems, from out the caskets old Of night, with fires that throb and thirst: An oleander, showering gold, The heav'n seems, star-immersed. Unseal, unseal thine eyes!â Too long her rod Queen Mab sways o'er their skies In realms of Nod!â Their starry majesties Will fill the night with God. Unseal, unseal thine eyes! IDEAL DIVINATION How I have thought of her, Her I have never seen!â Now from a raying air She, like the Magdalene, Flowersâa face serene, Radiant with raven hair. Now in a balsam scent Laughs from the stars that gleam; Naked and redolent, Bends to me breasts of beam, Eyes that were made to dream, Throat that the dimples dent. Would she were real, ah me! Would she were real and here! And no âimpossible sheâ! But one to draw me near, Hold me and name me dear!â But, that can never be! âLiving, each learns to know Life is not worth its pain; Loving, each finds a woe Or, at the end, a chain: Fardled of hope we strain Whither no hope may know. âLife is too credulous Of time that beckons on. Memory still serves us thusâ Gauging each coming dawn By a day dead and gone, Day that 's a part of us.â So says my soul, that 's mocked Here of the flesh and held; Ever rebellion rocked, Fighting, forever quelled; Titan-like, fate-compelled, Yearning to rise, but locked Supine where torrents pour Hellward; on crags that, high, Scarred of the thunder, gore Heaven ... The vulture's eye Swims, and the harpies' cry Clangs through the ocean's roar. ... Then, like Ã¦olian light, Calling, it hears her lips: Scorched by her burning white Splendor of arms and hips, Slimy each horror slips Back to its native night. ... Rul'st thou some brighter star? Inviolable queen Of what the destinies are? Thou, with thy light unseen Filling my life with sheen, Leading my soul afar! Thou, who oft leav'st thy skies, Comest in dreams to me, With amaranthine eyes, Asphodel shadowy Hair, and mysteriously Say'st to my heart, âArise! âBe not afraid to dare All of life's tyranny! I will reward thee there! There, where my love shall be Thine to eternity!â Only be brave and bear!â APOCALYPSE Before I found her I had found Within my heart, as in a brook, Reflections of her: now a sound Of imaged beauty, now a look. So when I found her, gazing in Those Bibles of her eyes, above All earth, I saw no word of sin; Their holy chapters all were love. I read them through. I read and saw The soul impatient of the sodâ Her soul, that through her eyes did draw Mineâto the higher love of God. CAN I FORGET? Can I forget how Love once led the ways Of our two lives together, joining them; How every hour was his anadem, And every day a tablet in his praise! Can I forget how, in his garden's place, Among the purple roses, stem to stem, We heard the rumor of his robe's bright hem, And saw the aureate radiance of his face!â Though I beheld my soul's high dreams down-hurled, And Falsehood sit where Truth once towered white, And in Love's place usurping Lust and Shame, Though flowers be dead within the winter world, Are flowers not there? and starless though the night, Are stars not there, eternal and the same? MY ROSE There was a rose in Eden once: it grows On Earth now, sweeter for its rare perfume: And Paradise is poorer by one bloom, And Earth is richer. In this blossom glows More loveliness than old seraglios Or courts of kings did ever yet illume: More purity than ever yet had room In soul of nun or saint.âO human rose!â Who art initial and sweet period of My heart's divinest sentence; where I read Love, first and last, and in the pauses, love; Who art the dear ideal of each deed Through which my life is strong to attain its goal,â Set in the mystic garden of my soul! RESTRAINT Dear heart and love! what happiness is it To watch the firelight's varying shade and shine On thy young face; and through those eyes of thineâ As through clear windowsâto behold them flit, In sumptuous chambers of thy mind's chaste wit, Thy soul's fair fancies! then to take in mine Thy hand, whose pressure brims my heart's divine Hushed rapture as with music exquisite! When I remember how thy look and touch Sway, like the moon, my blood with ecstasy, I dare not think to what fierce heaven might lead Thy soft embrace; or in thy kiss how much Sweet hell,âbeyond all help of me,âmight be, Where I were lost, where I were lost indeed! IN JUNE I Hotly burns the amaryllis, Starred with ruby red: Coolly stand the snowy lilies In the lily-bed: Emerald gleams the wild May-apple, 'Neath its parasol, And where gold the sunbeams dapple Woods, and thrushes call, Marion strolls with Moll, Singing, âFol-de-rol; Fol-de, fol-de-rol. II âMarch was but a blustering liar; April, sad as night: May, a milkmaid from the byre, Full of love but light. June, sweet June!âah! she's My Lady, Fair and fine and tall, Strolling down the woodways shadyâ June is best of all! She is like my Moll! Fol-de-rol-de-rol! She is like sweet Moll!â WILL O' THE WISPS Beyond the barley meads and hay, What was the light that beckoned there? That made her young lips smile and say: âOh, busk me in a gown of May, And knot red poppies in my hair.â Over the meadow and the wood What was the voice that filled her ears? That sent into pale cheeks the blood, Until each seemed a wild-brier bud Mowed down by mowing harvesters? ... Beyond the orchard, down the hill, The water flows, the water swirls; And there they found her past all ill, Her pale dead face, sweet, smiling still, The cresses caught among her curls. At twilight in the willow glen What sound is that the silence hears, When deep the dusk is hushed again, And homeward from the fields strong men And women go, the harvesters? One seeks the place where she is laid, Where violets bloom from year to yearâ âO sunny head! O bird-like maid! The orchard blossoms fall and fade And I am lonely, lonely here.â Two stars look down upon the vale; They seem to him the eyes of Ruth: The low moon rises very pale As if she, too, had heard the tale, All heartbreak, of a maid and youth. IN A GARDEN The pink rose drops its petals on The moonlit lawn, the moonlit lawn; The moon, like some wide rose of white, Drops down the summer night. No rose there is As sweet as thisâ Thy mouth, that greets me with a kiss. The lattice of thy casement twines With jasmine vines, with jasmine vines; The stars, like jasmine blossoms, lie About the glimmering sky. No jasmine tress Can so caress Like thy white arms' soft loveliness. About thy door magnolia blooms Make sweet the glooms, make sweet the glooms; A moon-magnolia is the dusk Closed in a dewy husk. However much, No bloom gives such Soft fragrance as thy bosom's touch. The flowers blooming now will pass, And strew the grass, and strew the grass; The night, like some frail flower, dawn Will soon make gray and wan. Still, still above, The flower of True love shall live forever, Love. âIF I WERE HER LOVERâ I If I were her lover, I'd wade through the clover Over the fields before The gate that leads to her door; Over the meadows, To wait, 'mid the shadows, The shadows that circle her door, For the heart of my heart and more. And there in the clover Close by her, Over and over I'd sigh her: âYour eyes are as brown As the Night's, looking down On waters that sleep With the moon in their deepâ ... If I were her lover to sigh her. II If I were her lover, I'd wade through the clover Over the fields before The lane that leads to her door; I'd wait, 'mid the thickets, Or there by the pickets, White pickets that fence in her door, For the life of my life and more. I'd lean in the cloverâ The crisper For the dews that are overâ And whisper: âYour lips are as rare As the dewberries there, As ripe and as red, On the honey-dew fedâ ... If I were her lover to whisper. III If I were her lover, I'd wade through the clover Over the field before The pathway that leads to her door; And watch, in the twinkle Of stars that sprinkle The paradise over her door, For the soul of my soul and more. And there in the clover I'd reach her; And over and over I'd teach herâ A love without sighs, Of laughterful eyes, That reckoned each second The pause of a kiss, A kiss and ... that is If I were her lover to teach her. NOÃRA NoÃ«ra, when sad fall Has grayed the fallow, Leaf-cramped the wood-brook's brawl In pool and shallow; When, by the wood-side, tall Stands sere the mallow: NoÃ«ra, when gray gold And golden gray The crackling hollows fold By every way, Shall I thy face behold, Dear bit of May? When webs are cribs for dew, And gossamers Streak past you, silver-blue; When silence stirs One leaf, of rusty hue, Among the burrs: NoÃ«ra, thro' the wood, Or thro' the grain, Come, with the hoiden mood Of wind and rain Fresh in thy sunny blood, Sweetheart, again! NoÃ«ra, when the corn, Heaped on the fields, The asters' stars adornâ And purple shields Of ironweeds lie torn Among the wealds: NoÃ«ra, haply then, Thou being with me, Each ruined greenwood glen Will bud and be Spring's with the spring again, The spring in thee. Thou of the breezy tread, Feet of the breeze: Thou of the sunbeam head, Heart like a bee's: Face like a woodland-bred Anemone's. Thou to October bring An April part! Come, make the wild-birds sing, The blossoms start! NoÃ«ra, with the spring Wild in thy heart! Come with our golden year; Come as its gold: With the same laughing, clear, Loved voice of old: In thy cool hair one dear Wild marigold. AMONG THE ACRES OF THE WOOD I âI know, I know; The way doth go Athwart a greenwood glade, oh! White bloom the wild-plums in that glade, White as the bosom of the maid Who, stooping, sits, and milks and sings Among the dew-dashed clover rings, When fades the flush, the henna blush, The orange-glow of sunset low, And all the winds are laid, oh!â II âI wot, I wot.â And is it not Right o'er the viney hill?ââ âYea: where the wild-grapes mat and make Penthouses of each bramble-brake, And dangle plumes of fragrant blooms: Where threads of sunbeams string the glooms With beaded gold; and flowers unfold Their eyes of blue;âand all night through Sings, wildly shrill, one whippoorwill.â III âI ween, I ween, The path is green 'Neath beechen boughs that let Soft glimpses of the sapphire sky Gleam downward like a wood-nymph's eye: At night one far and lambent star Shines o'er it, like a watching Lar, 'Mid branching buds a tangled bud Among the acres of the wood, Where blooms the wet wild violet And only we have, trysting, met.â WORDS I can not tell what I would tell thee, What I would say, what thou shouldst hear; Words of the soul that should compel thee, Words of the heart to draw thee near. For when thou smilest, thou, who fillest My life with joy, and I would speak, 'Tis then my lips and tongue are stillest, Knowing all language is too weak. Look in my eyes: read there confession: The truest love hath least of art: Nor needs it words for its expression When soul speaks soul and heart speaks heart. THE SIRENS Wail! wail! and smite your lyres' sonorous gold, And beckon naked beauty; luring me With arms and breasts and hips of godly mold, Dark, wind-wild locks seen through the surf-blown sea! Vain all your magic! dull in unclosed ears! Beside one voice sweet-calling o'er the foam, That, in my heart, like some strong hand appears To gently, firmly draw my vessel home. WHY? Why are the bright stars brighter after rain? Why is strong love the stronger after pain? Reply, reply! Why sings the wild swan heavenliest when it dies? Why is fair love the fairest when it flies? Oh why! Oh why! Why are sweet kisses sweetest when they're dead? Why is love loveliest when 'tis buriÃ©d? Reply, reply! NOCTURNE A disc of violet blue, Rimmed with a thorn of fire, The new moon hangs in a sky of dew; And under the vines, where the sunset's hue Is blent with blooms, first one, then two, Begins the crickets' choir. Bright blurs of golden white, With points of pearly glimmer, The first stars wink in the web of night; And through the flowers the moths take flight, In the honeysuckle-colored light, Where the shadowy shrubs grow dimmer. Soft through the dim and dying eve, Sweet through the dusk and dew, Come, while the hours their witchcraft weave, Dim in the House of the Soul's-sweet-leave, Here in the pale and perfumed eve, Here where I wait for you. A great, dark, radiant rose, Dripping with starry glower, Is the night, whose bosom overflows With the balsam musk of the breeze that blows Into the heart, as each one knows, Of every nodding flower. A voice that sighs and sighs, Then whispers like a spirit, Is the wind, that kisses the drowsy eyes Of the primrose open, and, rocking, lies In the lily's cradle, and soft unties The rose-bud's crimson near it. Sweet through the deep and dreaming night, Soft through the dark and dew, Come, where the moments their magic write, Deep in the Book of the Heart's-delight, Here in the hushed and haunted night, Here where I wait for you. METAMORPHOSIS Before Love's lofty goddessâLife hath toiled To mold from burning dew and dewy fireâ Who kneel and worship with a heart sin-soiled, Within the secret Temple of Desire; Their curse is such: that, even while they pray,â They shall not see, nor shall they know thereof!â Their Deity is changed from fire to clayâ Lust! fashioned in the very form of Love. AT TWENTY-ONE The rosy hills of her high breasts, Whereon, like misty morning, rests The breathing lace; her auburn hair, Wherein, a star-point sparkling there, One jewel burns: her eyes, that keep Recorded dreams of love and sleep: Her mouth, with whose comparison The richest rose were poor and wan: Her throat, her formâwhat masterpiece Of man can picture half of these!â She comes! a classic from the hand Of God! wherethrough I understand What Nature means and Art and Love, And all the immortal myths thereof. KINSHIP. There is no flower of wood or lea, No April flower, as fair as she: O white anemone, who hast The wind's wild grace, Know her a cousin of thy race, Into whose face A presence like the wind's hath passed. There is no flower of wood or lea, No May-day flower, as fair as she: O bluebell, tender with the blue Of sapphire skies, Thy lineage hath kindred ties In her, whose eyes The heaven's own qualities imbue. There is no flower of wood or lea, No June-time flower, as fair as she: Rose,âodorous with beauty of Her lips that pressed,â Behold thy sister here confessed! Whose maiden breast Is fragrant with the dreams of love. âSHE IS SO MUCHâ She is so much to me, to me, And, oh, I love her so, I look into my soul and see How comfort keeps me company In hopes she, too, may know. I love her, I love her, I love her, This I know. So dear she is to me, so dear, And, oh, I love her so, I listen in my heart and hear The voice of gladness singing near In thoughts she, too, may know. I love her, I love her, I love her, This I know. So much she is to me, so much, And, oh, I love her so, In heart and soul I feel the touch Of angel callers, that are such Dreams as she, too, may know. I love her, I love her, I love her, This I know. HER EYES In her dark eyes dreams poetize; The soul sits lost in love: There is no thing in all the skies, To gladden all the world I prize, Like the deep love in her dark eyes, Or one sweet dream thereof. In her dark eyes, where thoughts arise, Her soul's soft moods I see: Of hope and faith, that make life wise; And charity, whose food is sighsâ Not truer than her own true eyes Is truth's divinity. In her dark eyes the knowledge lies Of an immortal sod, Her soul once trod in angel guise, Nor can forget its heavenly ties, Since, there in Heaven, upon her eyes Once gazed the eyes of God. MESSENGERS The wind, that gives the rose a kiss, With murmured music of the south, Hath kissed a sweeter thing than this;â The wind, that gives the rose a kiss,â Hath kissed the red rose of her mouth. The brook, that mirrors skies and trees, And echoes in a grottoed place, Hath held a fairer thing than these;â The brook, that mirrors skies and trees, Hath held the image of her face. O happy wind! O happy brook! What message from her do you bear?â âWe bear from her her kiss and lookââ O happy wind! O happy brook!â âThat blessed us unaware.â APART I While sunset burns and stars are few, And roses scent the fading light; And, like a slim urn, dripping dew, A spirit carries through the night, The pearl-pale moon hangs new,â I think of you, of you. II While waters flow, and soft winds woo The golden-hearted bud with sighs; And, like a flower an angel threw, Out of the momentary skies A star falls, burning blue,â I dream of you, of you. III While love believes and hearts are true, So let me think, so let me dream; The thought and dream so wedded to Your face, that, far apart, I seem To see each thing you do, And be with you, with you. THE BLIND GOD I know not if she be unkind; If she have faults, I do not care. Search through the worldâwhere will you find A face like hers, a form, a mind?â I love her to despair! If she be cruel, cruelty Is a great virtue, I will swear: If she be proud, then pride must be Better than all humility.â I love her to despair! Why speak to me of that or this? All you may say weighs not a hair! To me, naught but perfection is In her, whose lips I may not kiss!â I love her to despair! CARA MIA I Sweet lips, where kisses sleep, Soft eyes, so filled with dreams, Waken, oh waken! Open your blossoms deep, Sweet lips, where kisses sleep: Unfold your brightest beams, Soft eyes, so filled with dreams: Waken, oh, waken! II Sweet lips, that give perfume, Soft eyes, that kindle light, Come, let me kiss you!â To every flower in bloom, Sweet lips, you lend perfume! In every star at night, Soft eyes, you kindle light!â Come, let me kiss you! III Who would not love to rest? Who would not love to lie? Who would not love them? Of such sweet flowers caressed, Who would not love to rest? With such stars in their sky, Who would not love to lie? Who would not love them? MARGERY I When spring is here and Margery Goes walking in the woods with me, She is so white, she is so shy, The little leaves clap hands and cryâ âPerdie; So white is she, so shy is she, Ah me! The maiden May hath just passed by!â II When summer 's here and Margery Goes walking in the fields with me, She is so pure, she is so fair, The wildflowers eye her and declareâ âPerdie! So pure is she, so fair is she, Just see, Where our sweet cousin takes the air!â III Why is it that my Margery Hears nothing that these say to me? She is so good, she is so true, My heart it maketh such ado, Perdie! So good is she, so true is she, You see, She can not hear the other two. CONSTANCE Beyond the orchard, in the lane, The crested red-bird sings againâ O bird, whose song says, âHave no care,â Should I not care when Constance there,â My Constance with the bashful gaze, Pink-gowned like some sweet hollyhock,â If I declare my love, just says Some careless thing as if in mock? LikeââPast the orchard, in the lane, Hark! how the red-bird sings again!â There, while the red-bird sings his best, His listening mate sits on the nestâ O bird, whose patience says, âAll 's well,â How can it be with me, come, tell? When Constance, with averted eyes,â Soft-bonneted as some sweet-pea,â If I talk marriage, just replies With some such quaint irrelevancy, As, âWhile the red-bird sings his best, His loving mate sits on the nest.â What shall I say? what can I do? Would such replies mean aught to you, O birds, whose music says, âBe gladâ? Have I not reason to be sad When Constance, with demurest glance, Her face all poppied with distress, If I reproach her, pouts, perchance, And answers thus in waywardness?â âWhat shall I say? what can I do? My meaning should be plain to you!â LYDIA When Autumn's here and days are short, Let Lydia laugh and, hey! Straightway 't is May-day in my heart, And blossoms strew the way. When Summer 's here and days are long, Let Lydia sigh and, ho! December's fields I walk among, And shiver in the snow. No matter what the seasons are, My Lydia is so dear, My heart admits no calendar Of Earth when she is near. HELEN Heaped in raven loops and masses Over temples smooth and fair, Have you marked it, as she passes, Night and starlight mingled there,â Braided strands of midnight air,â Helen's hair? Deep with dreams and moony mazes Of the thought that in them lies, Have you seen them, as she raises Them in question or surprise,â Two gray gleams of daybreak skies,â Helen's eyes? Fresh as dew and honied wafters Of a music sweet that slips, Have you marked them, brimmed with laughter's Song and sunshine to their tips,â Blossoms whence the perfume drips,â Helen's lips? He who sees her needs must lover her: But, beware, whoe'er thou art! Lest like me thou shouldst discover Nature overlooked one part, In this masterpiece of artâ Helen's heart. MIGNON Oh, Mignon's mouth is like a rose, A red, red rose, that half uncurls Sweet petals o'er a crimson bee: Or like a shell, that, opening, shows Within its rosy curve white pearls, White rows of pearls, Is Mignon's mouth that smiles at me. Oh, Mignon's eyes are like blue gems, Two azure gems that gleam and glow, Soft sapphires set in ivory: Or like twin violets, whose stems Bloom blue beneath the covering snow, The lidded snow, Are Mignon's eyes that laugh at me. O mouth of Mignon, Mignon's eyes! O eyes of violet, mouth of fire!â Within which lies all ecstasy Of tears and kisses and of sighs:â O mouth, O eyes, and O desire, O love's desire, Have mercy on the soul of me! TRANSUBSTANTIATION I A sunbeam and a drop of dew Lay on a red rose in the South: God took the three and made her mouth, Her sweet, small mouth, So red of hue,â The burning baptism of His kiss Still fills my heart with heavenly bliss. II A dream of truth and love come true Slept on a star in daybreak skies: God mingled these and made her eyes, Her dear, clear eyes, So gray of hue,â The high communion of His gaze Still fills my soul with deep amaze. LOVE AND A DAY I In girandoles of gladioles The day had kindled flame; And Heaven a door of gold and pearl Unclosed, whence Morning,âlike a girl, A red rose twisted in a curl,â Down sapphire stairways came. Said I to Love: âWhat must I do? What shall I do? what can I do?â Said I to Love: âWhat must I do, All on a summer's morning?â Said Love to me: âGo woo, go woo.â Said Love to me: âGo woo. If she be milking, follow, O! And in the clover hollow, O! While through the dew the bells clang clear, Just whisper it into her ear, All on a summer's morning.â II Of honey and heat and weed and wheat The day had made perfume; And Heaven a tower of turquoise raised, Whence Noon, like some pale woman, gazedâ A sunflower withering at her waistâ Within a crystal room. Said I to Love: âWhat must I do? What shall I do? what can I do?â Said I to Love: âWhat must I do, All in the summer nooning?â Said Love to me: âGo woo, go woo.â Said Love to me: âGo woo. If she be 'mid the rakers, O! Among the harvest acres, O! While every breeze brings scents of hay, Just hold her hand and not take ânay,â All in the summer nooning.â III With song and sigh and cricket cry The day had mingled rest; And Heaven a casement opened wide Of opal, whence, like some young bride, The Twilight leaned, all starry eyed, A moonflower on her breast. Said I to Love: âWhat must I do? What shall I do? what can I do?â Said I to Love: âWhat must I do, All in the summer gloaming?â Said Love to me: âGo woo, go woo.â Said Love to me: âGo woo, Go meet her at the trysting, O! And 'spite of her resisting, O! Beneath the stars and afterglow, Just clasp her close and kiss herâso, All in the summer gloaming.â LOVE IN A GARDEN I Between the rose's and the canna's crimson, Beneath thy window in the night I stand; The jeweled dew hangs little stars, in rims, on The white moonflowers; each a spirit hand That points the path to mystic Shadowland. Awaken, sweet and fair! And add to night thy grace! Suffer its loveliness to share The white moon of thy face, The dark cloud of thy hair. Awaken, sweet and fair! II A moth, like down, swings on th' althea's pistil,â Ghost of a tone that haunts its bell's deep dome;â And in the August-lily's cone of crystal A firefly hangs the lantern of a gnome, Green as a gem that gleams through hollow foam. Approach! the moment flies! O sweetheart of the South! Come! mingle with night's mysteries The red rose of thy mouth, The dark stars of thine eyes.â Approach! the moment flies! III Dim through the dusk, like some unearthly presence, The night-song silvers of a dreaming bird; And with it borne, faint on a breeze-blown essence, The rainy whisper of a fountain's heardâ As if young lips had breathed a perfumed word. How long, my love, my bliss! How long must I await With nightâthat all impatience isâ Thy greeting at the gate, And at the gate thy kiss? How long, my love, my bliss! FLORIDIAN I The cactus and the aloe bloom Beneath the window of your room; That window where, at evenfall, Beneath the twilight's first pale star, You linger, tall and spiritual, And hearken my guitar. It is the hour When every flower Is wooed of moth or beeâ Would, would you were the flower, dear, And I the moth to draw you near, To draw you near to me, My dear, To draw you near to me! II The jasmine and bignonia spill Their balm about your windowsill; That sill where, when magnolia-white, In foliage mists, the moon hangs far, You lean with bright deep eyes of night, And hearken my guitar. It is the hour When from each flower The wind woos essencesâ Would, would you were the flower, love, And I the wind to breathe above, To breathe above and kiss, My love, To breathe above and kiss! WHEN SHIPS PUT OUT TO SEA I It's âSweet, good-by,â when pennants fly And ships put out to sea; It 's a loving kiss, and a tear or two In an eye of brown or an eye of blue:â And you'll remember me, Sweetheart, And you'll remember me. II It's âFriend or foe?â when signals blow And ships sight ships at sea; It's âClear for action! and man the guns!â As the battle nears and the battle runs;â And you'll remember me, Sweetheart, And you'll remember me. III It's deck to deck, and wrath and wreck, When ships meet ships at sea; It's scream of shot and shriek of shell, And hull and turret a roaring hell;â And you'll remember me, Sweetheart, And you'll remember me. IV It's doom and death, and pause a breath, When ships go down at sea; It's hate is over and love begins, And war is cruel whoever wins;â And you'll remember me, Sweetheart, And you'll remember me. A CHRISTMAS CATCH When roads are mired with ice and snow, And the air of morn is crisp with rime; When the holly hangs by the mistletoe, And bells ring in the Christmas-time:â It'sâSaddle, my Heart! and ride away To the sweet-faced girl with eyes of gray! Who waits with a smile for the gifts you bringâ A man's strong love and a wedding-ringâ It'sâSaddle, my Heart, and ride! When vanes veer north and storm-winds blow, And the sun at noon is a blur o'erhead; When the holly hangs by the mistletoe, And the Christmas service is sung and said:â It'sâCome, O my Heart, and wait a while, Where the organ peals, in the altar aisle, For the gifts that the church now gives to youâ A woman's hand and a heart that's true. It'sâCome, O my Heart, and wait! When rooms gleam warm with the fire's glow, And the sleet raps sharp on the window-pane: When the holly hangs by the mistletoe, And Christmas revels begin again:â It'sâHome, O my Heart, and love, at last! And her happy breast to your own held fast: A song to sing and a tale to tell, A good-night kiss and all is well. It'sâHome, O my Heart, and love! A SONG FOR YULE I Sing, Hey, when the time rolls round this way, And bells peal out, 'Tis Christmas Day! The world is better then by half, For joy, for joy: In a little while you will see it laughâ For a song's to sing and a glass to quaff, My boy; my boy. So here 's to the man who never says nay!â Sing, Hey, a song of Christmas Day! II Sing, Ho, when roofs are white with snow, And homes are hung with mistletoe: Old Earth is not half bad, I wisâ What cheer! what cheer! How it ever seemed sad the wonder isâ With a gift to give and a girl to kiss, My dear; my dear. So here 's to the girl who never says no! Sing, Ho, a song of the mistletoe! III No thing in the world to the heart seems wrong When the soul of a man walks out with song; Wherever they go, glad hand in hand, And glove in glove, The round of the land is rainbow-spanned, And the meaning of life they understand Is love; is love. Let the heart be open, the soul be strong, And life will be glad as a Christmas song. CHORDS I When love delays, when love delays and joy Steals like a shadow o'er the happy hills; When hope is gone; and no to-morrow fills The promise of to-day; still I employ My soul with thoughts of thee, Who 'rt not for me, for me! When love delays, when love delays and song Aches at wild lips, unutterable, as the sound Of ocean strives, within the shell's mouth bound; And hope is gone for ever, slain of wrong; Still in my heart one word Keeps calling like a bird. When love delays, when love delays and sleep Seals tired eyelids,âlike the sound of foam, Heard 'mid familiar flowers far from home,â When hope lies dead; in dreams, in dreams I keep Feeling thy lips' sweet touch,â And, oh! it is too much! When love delays, when love delays and sorrow Drinks her own tears that add but to her thirst; When song and sleep and love itself seem curst, And hope lies dead; still, still I dream to-morrow Will bring some word of cheer From thee who art not here. Will love delay, will love delay till death Hath sealed these lips and locked these eyes in night? Till unto love and hate indifferent quite This form shall lie? Then wilt thou, wild of breath, Bend down and kiss me there When I no more shall care? II If thou wouldst know the Beautiful that breathes And beckons through the World, far must thou seek! ... She is no shadow wreathed with hemlock wreaths; No drowsy sorrow whose wan eyes are weak With melancholy vigils; and no shade Of tragic sin of the sweet sun afraid: No tearful anger torn of truthless love, Who stabs her sick heart to the dagger's hilt For vengeance sweet; no miser mood, or maid, In owlet towers!âNay! she sings above On morning meads 'mid flowers that never wilt. If thou dost seek the Beautiful, beware! Lest thou discover her, nor know 'tis she; And she enslave thee to thy heart's despair, And fill thy soul with yearning, utterly, For that wild-rose which is her mouth, that brings Dew-odors of the dawn; for those twin springs Of light, her eyes; the bloom of her white brow, O'er which the foliage of her dark hair lies: The melody which is her heart, that sings The poetry of love, to which all bow, Both gods and men, the love that never dies. Lost art thou then, lost as the first lone star Set in the splendor of the sunset's wave; Lost in thy loneliness of searching far, Striving to clasp her, evermore her slave: Lostâgladly lost! a devotee to her Who, in the end, perhaps may let thee share A portion of her bliss, her heritage Of happiness in the same way and wise As woods and waters share it.âThen prepare Thy soul,âmade perfect,âfor its final wage, Her kiss, whose touch shall apotheosize. III Now that the orchard's leaves are sere, And drip with rain instead of dew, No moon-bright fruit hangs moon-like here, And dead your long white lilies too,â And dead the heart that broke for you: How comes the dim touch of your arm? Your faint lips on my feverish cheek? Your eyes near mine? deep as a charm, And gray, so gray! till I am weak, Weak with wild tears and can not speak. I am as one who walks in dreams; Sees, as in youth, his father's home; Hears from his native mountain streams Far music of continual foam, And one sweet voice that bids him come. AT HER GRAVE I With your eyes of April blue, And your mouth Like a May-rose, fresh with dew, Of the South, With your hair as golden sweet As the ripples of ripe wheat, How you make my old heart beat!â Who are you? II There is something that I knew, Long ago, In your voice that thrills me through With the glow Of remembered happiness; And your lookâI can not guess What it is there, nor express.â Who are you? III You are like her! even the hue Of her eyes!â It is strange you stop here, too, Where she lies!â Where she lies who was, you see, All to me a girl could beâ But no wife.âYou stare at me.â Who are you? IV Well, I left her. That 's not newâ God above! Men, who live so, often do. 'T is n't love. So I broke her heart, they say,â And been wretched since that day: And our childâdon't turn away!â Who are you? A CONFESSION These are the facts:âI was to blame. I brought her here and wrought her shame. She came with me all trustingly. Lovely and innocent her face: And in her perfect form, the grace Of purity and modesty. I think I loved her then: would dote On her ambrosial breast and throat, Young as a wildflower's tenderness: Her eyes, that were both glad and sad: Her cheeks and chin, that dimples had: Her mouth, red-ripe to kiss and kiss. Three months passed by; three moons of fire; When in me sickened all desire: And in its place a devil,âwho Filled all my soul with deep disgust, And on the victim of my lust Turned eyes of loathing,âswiftly grew. One night, when by my side she slept, I rose: and leaning, while I kept The dagger hid, I kissed her hair And mouth: and, when she smiled asleep, Into her heart I drove it deepâ And left her dead, still smiling there. LAST DAYS Ah! heartbreak of the tattered hills, And heartache of the autumn sky! Heartbreak and heartache, since God wills, Are mine, and God knows why! I held one dearer than each day Of life God sets in sunny goldâ But Death hath ta'en that gem away, And left me poor and old. The heartbreak of the hills is mine, Of trampled twig and rain-beat leaf, Of wind that sobs through thorn and pine An unavailing grief. The sorrow of the loveless skies' âFarewellsâ are wild as those I said When last I kissed my child's blue eyes And lips, ice-dumb and dead. AT TWILIGHT Once more she holds me with her pensive eyes; Once more I feel her voice's witchery Within my heart unfountain tears and sighs, And fill the soul of me. Once more she bends a silent face above; Once more I feel her hands' soft touches shake My life, unbinding long-imprisoned love, Bidding my lost dreams wake. Once more I see her serious smile; and touch Once more the lips of her whose kisses sayâ âThe night was long, and thou hast suffered much: At last, dear heart, 't is day!â DAY AND NIGHT They said to me, âThe days are not so far off When she will come, who gave her heart to thee;â And still I wait, while twilight's lonely star, off Her long-loved hills, dips dewy to the sea. And I recall that night, which gave its soul of Calm beauty to the earth, when she did give Her love's white starlight to the rugged whole of My barren life and bade me see and live. The days go by, and my sick soul recalls but The revelation of that evening sky: The days! whose hours are as narrow walls,â but Of whiter shadow,âwhere hearts break and die. The day is error's: it can but deceive us With shows of Earth, blind with the primal curse. The night is truth's: its myriad fires weave us The thoughts of God, the visible universe. THREE BIRDS A red bird sang upon the bough When wind-flowers nodded in the dew: My spring of bird and flower wast thou, O tried and true! A brown bird warbled on the wing When poppy buds were hearts of heat: I wooed thee with a golden ring, O sad and sweet! A black-bird twittered in the mist When nightshade blooms were filled with frost: The leaves upon thy grave are whist, O loved and lost! UNREQUITED Passion? not hers! who held me with pure eyes: One hand among the deep curls of her brow, I drank the girlhood of her gaze with sighs: She never sighed, nor gave me kiss or vow. So have I seen a clear October pool, Cold, liquid topaz, set within the sere Gold of the woodland, tremorless and cool, Reflecting all the heartbreak of the year. Sweetheart? not she! whose voice was music-sweet; Whose face was sweeter than melodious prayer. Sweetheart I called her.âWhen did she repeat Sweet to one hope, or heart to one despair! So have I seen a wildflower's fragrant head Sung to and sung to by a longing bird, And at the last, albeit the bird lay dead, No blossom wilted, for it had not heard. THE HEART'S DESIRE God made her body out of foam and flowers, And for her hair the dawn and darkness blent; Then called two planets from their heavenly towers, And in her face, divinely eloquent, Gave them a firmament. God made her heart of rosy ice and fire, Of snow and flame, that freezes while it burns; And of a starbeam and a moth's desire He made her soul, to'ards which my longing turns, And all my being yearns. So is my life a prisoner unto passion, Enslaved of her who gives nor sign nor word; So in the cage her loveliness doth fashion Is love endungeoned, like a golden bird That sings but is not heard. Could it but once convince her with beseeching! But once compel her as the sun the south! Could it but once, fond arms around her reaching, Upon the red carnation of her mouth Dew its eternal drouth! Then might I rise victorious over sadness, O'er fate and change, and, with but little care, Torched by the glory of that moment's gladness, Breast the black mountain of my life's despair, And die, or do and dare. OUT OF THE DEPTHS I Let me forget her face! So fresh, so lovely! the abiding place Of tears and smiles that won my heart to her; Of dreams and moods that moved my soul's dim deeps, As strong winds stir Dark waters where the starlight glimmering sleeps.â In every lineament the mind can trace, Let me forget her face! II Let me forget her form! Soft and seductive, that contained each charm, Each grace the sweet word maidenhood implies; And all the sensuous youth of line and curve, That makes men's eyes Bondsmen of beauty, eager still to serve.â In every part that memory can warm, Let me forget her form! III Let me forget her, God! Her who made honeyed love a bitter rod To scourge my heart with, barren with despair; To tear my soul with, sick with vain desire!â Oh, hear my prayer! Out of the hell of love's unquenchable fire I cry to thee, with face against the sod, Let me forget her, God! âTHIS IS THE FACE OF HERâ This is the face of her I've dreamed of long That in my heart I bear: This is the face of her Pictured in song. Look on the lily lids, The eyes of dawn,â Deep as a Nereid's, Swimming with dewy lids In waters wan. Look on the brows of snow, The locks of night: Only the gods can show Such brows of placid snow, Such locks of light. The cheeks, like rosy moons; The lips of fire: Love sighs no sweeter tunes Under romantic moons Than these suspire. Loved lips and eyes and hair! Look, this is she! She, who sits smiling there, Throned in my heart's despair, Never for me! INDIFFERENCE She is so dear the wildflowers near Each path she passes by, Are over fain to kiss again Her feet and then to die. She is so fair the wild birds there That sing upon the bough, Have learned the staff of her sweet laugh, And sing no other now. Alas! that she should never see, Should never care to know, The wildflower's love, the bird's above, And his, who loves her so. GHOST WEATHER Wild gusts of drizzle hoot and hiss Through writhing lindens torn in twoâ The dead's own days are days like this! Yea; let me sit and be with you. Here in your willow chair, whose seat Spreads purple plush.âHark! how the gusts Seem moaning voices that repeat Some grief here; in this room, where dusts Make dim each ornament and chair; This locked-in memory where you died: Since angels stood here, saintly fear Guards each dark corner, mournful-eyed. Through this dim light bend your dim face; Or, like a rain-mist, gray of gleam, A soft, dim cloudiness of lace, Stand near me while I dream, I dream. THE FOREST POOL One memory persuades me when Dusk's lonely star burns overhead, To take the gray path through the glenâ That finds the forest pool, made red With sunsetâand forget again, Forget that she is dead. Once more I look into the spring, That on one rock a finger white Of foam that beckons still doth bringâ Some moon-wan spirit of the night, Who dwells within its murmuring, Her life the sad moonlight. I see the red dusk touch it here With fire like a blade of blood; One star reflected, white and clear, Like a wood-blossom's drowning bud; While all my grief stands very near, Pale in the solitude. And then, behold, while yet the moon Hangsâsilver as a twisted horn Blown out of Elflandâsweet with June, White in white clusters of the thorn, Slow, in the water as a tune, An image pale is born: That has her throat of frost; her lipsâ Her mouth where God's anointment lies; Her eyes, wherefrom love's arrow-tips Break, like the starlight from dark skies; Her hair, a hazel heap that slips; Her throat and hair and eyes. And then I stoop; the water kissed, The face fades from me into air; And in the pool's dark amethyst My own pale face returns my stare: Then night and mistâand in the mist One dead leaf drifting there. AT SUNSET Into the sunset's turquoise marge The moon dips, like a pearly barge Enchantment sails through magic seas, To fairyland Hesperides, Over the hills and away. Into the fields, in ghost-gray gown, The young-eyed dusk comes slowly down; Her apron filled with stars she stands. And one or two slip from her hands Over the hills and away. Above the wood's black caldron bends The witch-faced Night and, muttering, blends The dew and heat, whose bubbles make The mist and musk that haunt the brake Over the hills and away. Oh, come with me, and let us go Beyond the sunset lying low, Beyond the twilight and the night, Into Love's kingdom of long light, Over the hills and away. DEAD AND GONE Can you tell me how he rests, Flowers, growing o'er him there? His a right warm heart, my sweets,â So, cover it with care. Can you tell me how he lies Such nights out in the cold, O cricket, with your plaintive call, O glow-worm, with your gold? If my eyes are sorrowful, Well may they weep, I trow,â Since his dead eyes gazed into them, They have been sad enow. If my heart make moan and ache, Well may it break, I'm sureâ For his dead love is more, ah me! More than it can endure. ONE NIGHT I A night of rain. The wind is out. And I had wished it otherwise: A calm, still night; no scudding skies; Or, in the scud, above the rout, The moon; by whose pale light my eyes Might meet her eyes; the smile that tries To come but will not; lips, that pout With seeming anger, all surmise, When I have said âI love your liesââ Lips I shall kiss before she dies. II What force this wind has! As it runs Around each unprotecting tree It seems some beast; and now I see Its form, its eyes; a woman's once:â Dark eyes! that blaze as lionly As some bayed beast's, that will not flee The pine-knots and derides the guns.â Or is it but the thought in me! The thought of that which is to be, The deed, that rises shadowy? III And now the trees and whipping rain Confuse them. ... I must drive it hence, The memory of her eyes! the tense Wild look within them of hard pain! ... Yet she must dieâwith every sense Strung to beholding knowledge, whence My heart shall be made whole again.â Here I will wait where night is dense. Soon she will come, like Innocence, Thinking her youth is her defense. IV And when she leaves,âand none perceives,â The old gray manor, where the eight Old locusts, (twisted shadows), freight With mossy murmurings its eaves, One moment at the iron gate She 'll tarry. Then, with breath abate, Come rustling through the autumn leaves. And I will take both hands and sate My mouth on hers and say, âYou 're lateâ; She'll laugh to hear I had to wait. ... V O passion of past vows, revive Imagination, and renew The ardor of love's language you For love's rose-altar kept alive! Repeat the oaths that rang with dew And starlight!âTell her she is true As beautiful.âI will contrive To make her think I have no clue To all her falseness. I will woo As once I wooed before I knew. VI And we will walk against the wind; The shuffling leaves about our feet; Our ruin, as the wood's, complete, Because one woman so hath sinned And never suffered. She shall meet No murder in my eyes; no heat Of fate in holding hand that 's pinned To hers. To make her trust to beat, I'll kiss her hand, her hair,âlike wheat Of affluent summer,âsaying âSweet.â VII And should I bungle in this thing, This purpose that must see her dead To cure this fever in my head?â What other thing is there to bring Soul satisfaction? when is shed No real blood, save what makes red The baulked intention?âI will fling The mask aside!âBut hate hath led Desire too far now to be fed With failure. I have naught to dread. VIII When we have reached the precipice That thwarts the battling of the sea, And wallows out great rocks, that knee The giant foam with roar and hiss, I will not cease to coax and be The anxious lover. Trusting she Will not suspect my farewell kiss Until it turns a curse, and we Sway for an instant totteringly, And she has shrieked some prayer at me. IX O let me see wild terror there Upon her face! the wilder frown Of crime's apprisal, and renown Of my life's injury, that bare This horror with its bloody crown!â No pity, God! For, if her gown, Suspending looseness of her hair, Delay the plunge ... the night is brown ... My heel must crush her white face down, And Hell and Heaven see her drown. THE PARTING She passed the thorn-trees, whose gaunt branches tossed Their spider-shadows round her; and the breeze, Beneath the ashen moon, was full of frost, And mouthed and mumbled in the sickly trees, Like some starved hag who sees her children freeze. Dry-eyed she waited by the sycamore. Some stars made misty blotches in the sky. And all the wretched willows on the shore Looked faded as a jaundiced cheek or eye. She felt deep sorrow yet could only sigh. She heard his skiff grind on the river rocks Whistling he came into the shadow made By the great tree. He kissed her on her locks; And round her form his eager arms were laid. Passive she stood her purpose unbetrayed. And then she spoke, while still his greeting kiss Stung in her hair. She did not dare to lift Her face to his; her anguished eyes to his While tears smote crystal in her throat. One rift Of weakness humored might set all adrift. Anger and shame were his. She meekly heard. And then the oar-locks sounded, and her brain Remembered he had said no farewell word; And swift emotion swept her; and again Left her as silent as a carven pain. ... She, in the old sad farm-house, wearily Resumed the drudgery of her common lot, Regret remembering.â'Midst old vices, he, Who would have trod on, and somehow did not, The wildflower, that had brushed his feet, forgot. THE DAUGHTER OF THE SNOW Though the panther's footprints show, And the wild-cat's, in the snow, You will never find a trace Of the footsteps of a certain Maiden with a paler face Than the drifts that fill and curtain Hillside, valley, and the wood, Where the hunter's wigwam stood In the winter solitude. What white beast hath grown the fur For the whiter limbs of her?â Raiment of the frost and ice To her supple beauty fitting; Wampum strouds, as white as rice, Of the frost's fantastic knitting, Wrap her form and face complete; Glove her hands with ice; her feet Moccasin with beaded sleet. 'Though he knew she made a haunt Of the dell, it did not daunt: Where the hoar-frost mailed each tree In soft, phantom alabaster, And hung ghosts of bud and bee On each autumn-withered aster; By the frozen waterfall, There she stood, beneath its wall, In the ice-sheathed chaparral. Where the beech-tree and the larch Built a white triumphal arch For the Winter, marching down With his icy-armored leaders; Where each hemlock had a crown, And pale diadems the cedars; Where the long icicle shone, There he saw her, standing lone, Like a mist-wraith turned to stone. And she led him many a mile With her hand-wave and her smile, And the printless swiftness of Feet of frost, and snowy flutter Of her raiment; now above, Now below, the boughs of utter Winter whiteness. Led him on Till the dawn and day were gone, And the evening star hung wan. ... Hunters found him dead, they tell, In the winter-wasted dell, With his quiver and his bow, Where the cascade ran a rafter, White, of crystal and of snow; Where he listened to her laughter, Promises, that were as far As the secrets of a star, And her love that naught could mar. And her countenance is this Stamped on his: and this her kiss, Haunting still his mouth and eyes, Colder than the cold December: This her passion, that defies All control, the stars remember Filled him, killed him: this is she Clinging to him, neck and knee, Where his limbs sank wearily. THE SPIRIT OF THE STAR (Love Spiritual) âThis union of the human soul with the divine Ã¦thereal substance of the universe, is the ancient doctrine of Pythagoras and Plato.ââ Divine Legation. There is love for love: the heaven Teems with possibilities: And, when love is purely given, Love returns from where none sees: And such love becomes a ladder Reaching heavenward, from the sadder Night of Earth; from out the driven Darkness of its miseries. There is love for love: and Beauty, From her star above the Earth, Smiles, and straight each cloud of sooty Night takes on celestial worth: And, like some white flower unfolding, Love is born; and softly holding Up its face, as if in duty, Grows to that which gave it birth. Earth and Heaven are prolific Of love's wonders: and the sky Teems with spirits, fair, terrific, Who, if loved, shall never die: DÃ¦mons, haggard as their mountains; Naiads, sparkling as their fountains; Sylphids of the winds, pacific As the stars they tremble by. ... Such was I; who long had waited For the everlasting sleep: Where, around me, worlds dilated, Waned or waxed within the deep: Where, beneath my star, a planet Whirled and shone, like glowing granite, While around it ne'er abated One white satellite its sweep. I was sad: my beauty wearied, Useless as a scentless bud Fading ere it blooms. The serried Mists of worlds, as red as blood, Streamed beneath me. And the starry Firmament above bent, barry With the wild auroras, ferried Of the meteors' sisterhood. I was loveless with a yearning After love that never came; All my astral being burning Towards that world without a name, World I knew not: till, with splendor Of compulsion that was tender, Something drew me, unreturning, Filled me with a finer flame. So I left my star, whose lances Pierced with arrowy gold the heat Of heaven's hyacinth; its glances Saddened me. No more to meet, Then I left my star; and, beating Downward, heard it still repeating Far farewells; and through the trances Of dark space its face looked sweet. Passed your moon: a melancholy Disc at first; then, vast and sharp, Lo, a world, all white and holy! Where, upon the crystal scarp Of a mountain,âlike a story Of high Heaven revealed in glory,â Gradual, as if music slowly Built it, rolling from a harp,â Rose a city: cloudy nacre Were its walls, that towered round Acre upon arch-piled acre Of a marble-terraced ground: Caryatids alternated With Atlantes, sculpture-weighted: And its gatesâsome god the makerâ Rhombs of symboled diamond. In the white light glittered swimming Domes of dazzle: swirl on swirl, Temples lifted columns, brimming Crystal flame, that seemed to whirl: Battlemented moonstone darkled; Palaces, pale-pillared, sparkled, Cloudy opal: and, far dimming, Aqueducts of ghostly pearl. Streaming steeples shone, of dÃ¦dal Emblem; each an obelisk: Minarets, each one a needle, Balancing a bubble-disc; Some of diamond, like a blister Frozen; some of topaz-glister, Vinous; in whose blinding middle Blazed an orb of burning bisque. And I saw where, silvery slanted, A vast pyramidic heap Rose of spar; whereon was planted The acropolis of Sleep,â God of these:âthat, looming higher, Wrought of seeming ice and fire, Where pale rainbow-colors panted, Gleamed above the lunar deep. Robed in white simarre and chiton, Visions filled its every square, Moving like a finer light on Light: and in the glory there Music rang and golden laughter; And before each shape, and after, Radiance went, that shadowed white, on Temple and on palace stair. Though they called me, I descended Earthward. For great longing drew Me and, drawing me, was blended With your world. I never knew It was Earth, until,âforsaking Heaven,âI beheld it taking,â A great azure sphere,âits splendid Way along the singing blue. And when night came, here, above you,â Sleeping by your folded sheep On the hills,âI stooped: whereof you Dreamed: I kissed you in your sleep: I, your destiny, who wrought it So you knew me: you, who thought it Not so strange that I should love you, I a spirit of the deep. 'Twas your love that sought and found me, Drew me from that star-life sad; Won my soul to yours and bound me With such love as none hath had: I am she, you may remember, That fair star that seemed an ember O'er you, that you loved.âAround me Wrap your arms now and be glad. Look above: what seems a petal, Burning, of a rose; that far Point of radiance, bright as metal, Fiery silver, is your star! Look above you: rise unto it. Let it lead you now who drew it Down to Earth, where shadows settle!â On that star no shadows are! THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN (Love Ideal) âAmong the mountains of Carmarthen, lies a beautiful and romantic piece of water, named The Van Pools. Tradition relates, that after midnight, on New Year's Eve, there appears on this lake a being named The Spirit of the Van. She is dressed in a white robe, bound by a golden girdle; her hair is long and golden; her face is pale and melancholy.ââ Keightley's âFairy Mythology.â Midsummer-night; the Van. Through night's wan noon, Wading the storm-scud of an eve of storm, Pale o'er Carmarthen's peaks the mounting moon.â Wilds of Carmarthen! sombre heights, that swarm Girdling this water, as old giants might Crouch, guarding some enchanted gem of charm,â Wilds of Carmarthen, that for me each night ReÃ«cho prayers and pleadings,âall the year Unanswered,âmade to listening waters white! Mountains, behold me yet again! Bend near! Behold her lover! hers, that shape of snow, Who dwells amid these pools; who will not hear My heart's wild pleading, calling loud, now low, Unhappy, to her, 'mid the lonely hills. Whene'er a ripple trembles into glow, Where yeasty moonshine scuds the foam, straight thrills Heart's expectation through my veins, and high With âshe!â each pulse the exultation fills. But she 'tis never. Once ... and then! would I, Would I had perished, so beholding!âWorld, 'Twas you, O world, who would not let me die! Once I beheld her!âIf some fiend had curled Stiff talons in my hair, and, twisting tight, Had raised me high, then into Hell had hurled; Fresh from that vision of her beauty white, With Heaven in my soul, I, unamerced, Shackled with tortures, yet might mock Hell's spite. Immortal memory, quench in me this thirst!â O starlike vision, that a moment clove My sight, and then for ever left me curst! Oh, make me mad with love, with all thy love! Me, me, who seek thee 'mid these wilds when gloom Storms or drip gold the sibylline stars above!â Let thy high coming in a flash consume The light of all the stars! and make me mad, Mad with love's madness! fill me with sweet doom! Sleep will I not now, for my soul is sad: For, should I sleep, there might come other dreams,â Sadder than thou art,âin thy beauty clad And all thy tyranny. To me it seems Better to wake here, underneath this pine, Until thy face upon my vision gleams.â Thou, who art wrought of elements divine, And I of crasser clay, clay that will think, âSince I am hers, why should she not be mine?â Again, its usual phantom, on the brink Of thy lone lake, I ask thee: âMust I yearn Forever, haunted of that vision's wink?ââ When, glassing out great circles, which did urn Some intense essence of interior light, (As clouds, that clothe the moon, unbinding, burn, Riven, erupt her orb, triumphant white,) I saw, midmost the Van, a feathering fire Dilating ivory-wan.âExpectant night Tiptoed attentive, fearful to suspire.â Wherefrom aroseâwhat white divinity? What godhead sensed with glory and desire? Born for the moment for the eyes of me! Then re-absorbed into the brassy gloom Of whispering waves that sighed their ecstasy. Thou! in whose path harmonious colors bloom, Pale pearl and lilac, asphodel and rose,â Like many flow'rs auroral of perfume,â Thou leftst me thus, to marvel as who knows He is not dead and yet it seems he is, Since all his soul with spirit-rapture glows.â O sylph-like brow! lips like an angel's kiss! High immortality! whose face was such As starlight in a lily's loveliness! ... The gold that bound thee seemed too base to clutch Thy chastity, though clear as golden gum That almugs sweat, and fragrance to the touch! Thy hairânot hair!âseemed rays, like those that come Strained through the bubble of a chrysolite.â No word I said: thy beauty struck me dumb. Thy face, that is upon my soul's quick sight Eternal seared, hath made of me a shade, A wandering shadow of the day and night: A seeker 'mid the hoary hills for aid, The sole society of my sick heart, who Shuns all companionship of man and maid: Who, comrade of the mountain blossoms blue, And intimate of old trees, goes dreaming they,â As in that legendary world that drew Oracles from lips in oaksâ, may sometime say Prophetic precepts to it: how were won A spirit loved to love a mortal;âyea, In vain.â But one day, frog-like in the sun, Beside a cave,âthe nightshade vines made rank And hairy henbane, where huge spiders spun,â Wrinkled as Magic, I a grizzled, lank, Squat something startled, naught save skin and hair; With eyes wherein dwelt demons; flames, that shrank And grew;âfamiliars, who fixed me with glare As, raising claw-like hands when I drew near, Frog-like he croaked, âThou fool! go seek her there! Woo her with thy heart's actions! making clear Thy soul's white passage for her coming feet!â In! in! thou fool! plunge in! Fear naught but fear!â Yet I have waited many weeks. Repeat. Acts of the heart with passionate offering Of love whose anguish makes it seven times sweet. Still all in vain, in vain. To-night I bring My self alone; my soul unfearing, see! My soul unto thee!âShall the clay still cling Clogging fulfillment? and achievement be Balked still by flesh?âno! let me inâto die, Haply; or, for a moment's mystery, Gaze in thine eyes: one splendid instant lie In thy white arms and bosom; and thy kiss, My elemental immortality!â Part of thy breathing waves, to laugh or hiss In foam; or winds, that rock the awful deeps, Or build with song vast temples for thy bliss. Wherein, responsive as thy white hand sweeps The chords of some sad shell, I'll dream and roam Through glaucous chambers where the green day sleeps. Dead not with death, what secrets hath thy home Not mine then, epoched in exultant foam? ... Deeper, down deeper! yea, at last I come! THE CAVERNS OF KAF (Love Sensual) ââWhere am I?â cried he; âwhat are these dreadful rocks? these valleys of darkness? are we arrived at the horrible Kaf?âââ Vathek. One, Benreddin, I have heard, Near the town of Mosul sleeping, In a dream beheld a bird, Wonderful, with plumes of sweeping Whiteness, crowned pomegranate-red: And, it seemed, his soul it led, Brilliant as a blossom, keeping Near the Tigris as it fled. Following, at last he came To a haggard valley, shouldered Under peaks that had no name: Where it vanished. 'Mid the bouldered Savageness a woman, fair, In a white simarre, stood there, Auburn-haired; around whom smoldered Pensive lights of purple air. And she led him down to vast Caves of sardonyx, whose ceiling Domed one chrysoberyl. Blast On blast of music,âstealing Out of aural atmospheres,â Beat like surf upon his ears; Then receded, faintly pealing Psalteries and dulcimers. Living figures seemed to heave High the walls, where, wild, embattled, Warred Amshaspand and the Deev: Over all two splendors rattled Arms of Heaven, arms of Hell; Forms of flame that seemed to swell Godlike: Aherman who battled With Ormuzd he could not quell. There she left him wond'ring; till The reverberant music, drifting, Strong beyond his utmost will, Drew him onward where, high lifting Pillar and entablature, Vast with emblem, yawned a doorâ Valves of liquid lightning, shifting In and out and up and o'er. Through the door he swept: deep-domed, Green with serpentine and beryl, Loomed a cavern, crusted, foamed, Tortuous with gems of peril: Difficult, a colonnade Seemed, of satin-spar, to braid Deeps of labyrinthed and sterile Tiger-spar that, twisting, rayed. Dizzy stones of magic price Crammed volute and loaded corbel: Irridescent shafts of ice Leapt: with long reÃ«choed warble Waters unto waters sang: Crystal arc and column sprang Into fire as each marble Fountain flung its foam that rang. And around him, filled with sound, Streams of resonant colors jetted: Rainbow surf that interwound Crypts and arcades, crescent-fretted: Mists of citron and of roon; Lemon lights that mocked the moon; Shot with scarlet, veined and netted, Beating golden hearts of tune. Suns arose, of blinding blue; Moons of green-dilating splendor: In whose centers slowly grew Spots like serpents' eyes that, slender, Glared; at first, prismatic beams; Then, intolerable gleams; Hissing trails of fire, tender As an houri's breath that dreams. Characters of Arabic, Cabalistic, red as coral, Flashed through violet veils, so quick None might read: as if, in quarrel, Iran wrote of Turan there Hate and scorn, or, everywhere, Wrought some talisman of moral Strength no Afrit's heart would dare. Sounding splendors drew him on To another cavern; hollow; Hewn of alabastar wan; Lucid; where his gaze could follow Caves in caves; transparent flights Rolling, lost in moving lights, Glaucous gold: he like a swallow O'er a lake the morning smites. Down the dome flashed out and in Instant faces of the Peris: Restless eyes of Deevs and Jinn In the walls watched: unseen Faeries Out of rainbows rained and tossed Flowers of fire full of frost; Blossoms where the fire varies, Gold and green and crimson-mossed. Then there met him, face to face, Seven odalisques of Heaven, Swinging in a silver space Flaming censers: and the seven, Crowned with stars of burning green, Seemed to turn to incense; seen, As it rose, to be a driven Hippogrif, or rosmarine. Aloes, Nard, and Ambergris, Sandal, Frankincense, and Civet,â Genii of the fragrances,â Rein each winged aroma; give it Spurs and race it down the lull Of the caverns, clouded dull With wild manes of musk; now vivid, Vaporous white and wonderful. And Benreddin's aching soul, In each sense intoxicated, Reached, at last, what seemed the goal Of all passion: golden-gated, Vast, a fountain: where he saw Limbs of light without a flaw; Breasts and arms of bloom; that waited For his soul to nearer draw. Houri faces shimmered there; Fluid forms.âIt, with a thunder Of wild music, like the hair Of a genie, flamed from under Caverns of the demon-world: Filled with voices, high it hurled, Calling him, with beckoning wonder Of cÅrulean forms that swirled. And with burning lips and eyes In he plunged: hoarse laughter greeted, Demon laughter: then sad sighs, Dying downward: passion-heated Hands seemed drawing him away, Downward: where a rocking ray Flamed and swung, and Eblis-sheeted Shadows wandered ghostly gray. And, 'tis said, that he was young, Young that morning. When the darting, Anguish-throated bulbuls sung, In the silent starlight starting, One, a Baghdad merchant, led By the hoarness of its head, Found what seemed a mummy: parting Hair from brow, Benreddinâdead. THE SALAMANDER (Love DÃ¦monic) âThe Fire-Philosophers, and the Rosicrucians, or Illuminati, taught that all knowable things (both of the soul and of the body) were evolved out of fire, and finally resolvable into it: and that fire was the last and the only-to-be known God: as that all things were capable of being searched down into it, and all things were capable of being thought up into it.ââ The Rosicrucians. Once she breathed upon my eyes, Touched the soul that dreamed within me; All the magic that might win me Whispered to my heart with sighsâ Darkness can not make them lies! ... Bring me moly, hellebore! Mix them for my soul's nepenthe, For my spirit's dread Amenti, For the curse that comes once more With unutterable lore! Sunlight, starlight or the moon, Stormlight, firelight or the sheening Witchlight intimate no meaning Of her glory's plenilune; Of her soul's unriddled rune, And most awful beauty! nor Actual, nor yet ideal!â Insubstantial and yet real; Partly flame and partly star, Yet no part of what these are. I am hers andâwoe is mine! ... Has she drugged me with the sadness Of some elemental madness?â Like a demigod I pine 'Twixt the mortal and divine ... When I see her, lo, she stands In the luminous electre Of a star: a smiling spectre With white scintillating hands Luring to unhallowed lands. Then, behold, in fearful file, A mirage of tower and terrace, Lawn and mountain range,âthat buries Flame in frost,âlooms! mile on mile Of her crescent-glowing Isle: Where the lurid waters lull Shores that roll the rainbow fire; Where, with living lute and lyre, Rose-red, swiftly as a gull, Glides her star-like galley's hull. And, behold, before I know, I am where her walls of amber, Towers of limpid ruby, clamber Over terraces below Summits of refulgent snow. Lambent lazuli and shell Colonnade her courts of marble; Where, of lightning, fountains warble Out of basined pearl, or well Into hollowed carbuncle. Rosy silver seems her skin, And a flame her arm commanding, With its gleaming hand, me, standing At her gates, to enter in, Burning as a Seraphin. Lucid darkness are her eyes, Where the frozen fire smolders; And upon her shining shoulders, Like a tangible glitter, lies Auburn hair like sunset skies. Mouth of sibilant soft flame; Lilith lips, whose roses lighten With illusive love; and brighten With wild passion and the name Of desire no man may tame. Passion, and the thoughts that wed Love and loathing; such caresses Of sweet touch as naught expresses Here on Earth, yet full of dread, Madness, whereof death is bred. She hath drawn me to her lips; Borne me through her palace portal; And the fire, which is immortal, From me like a garment slipsâ Ah, the spirit-part's eclipse! As when moon and planet swoon Unto each, my body kindles, Strangely, while my spirit dwindles, Like the Earth-o'ershadowed moon, Darkening from lune to lune. Then she laughs; and leads me where Cloudy, wild, chameleon color Marbles halls with hues, the duller For her astral presence there, Beaming white with beaming hair: Where, in roses purple pale,â Dropping like a ruby bubble Through the moon dust,ââdouble double,â Throbs the crimson nightingale, There she lures me with some tale. Or to where the scarlet snake Coils beneath great flaming flowers; Where the musk mimosa bowers Roll their rosy clouds, and make Sunset heavens of each lake. Where the bees and moths go by, Fiery diamond; opal-burning Butterflies, and iris-turning Peacock-painted birds, that vie With the flow'rs, like fragments fly Of wild rainbow: Where, in rills, Down the rocks, that lichens redden, Constellated moss and leaden Fungus glow; and all the hills, As with flames, the orchid fills. Where, in coruscating light, Glare the golden-checkered zinnias; And the bugle-bloomed gloxinias, Making morning of each height, Float like mists of ruby white. There, beneath some blazing vine, Where the liquid moonlight glitters Of a river,âcoral litters Red with grail,âlike prisms in wine I have watched the fishes shine. Or, o'er sunset-colored moss, Glow-worms trail their beryls; sprinkling Green the smouldering shade; while, twinkling, With convulsive sapphire gloss, Fireflies rained blue lights across. Where the reeds seemed rays of rose, And white mirrored moons, the lotusâ Each a spirit giving notice Of the inner light that glows Where the under water flowsâ Shapes arose of flashing spray:â Where, a wild auroral splendor, Rolled the forest,âemerald-tender As the light of breaking day,â Beckoned forms of starry ray. Through the violetish light, Winged with nautilus and lily Flame, adown the forests stilly Vistas, moony whirls of white, Floated shapes with eyes of night. I must follow where she leads.â Blinding portals of her castle To my entering feet are facile. ... Love no terrible trumpet needs At her gates to bugle deeds. ... Lo, my being never veils Aught from her. To her caresses All my heart knows it confesses With a faith that never fails, Though it hears the truth that wails In its soul's admonishment, Of the curse that sits in session In each amorous expression Of her love; its violent Flame, by which my life is rent. I have drained the feverish cup Of all darkness. Made a leman Of an elemental demon; And my soul lies, staring up, Draining poison at each sup.â While she smiles on me 'tis well: I shall follow, though she make me What her self is; never wake me From the dream I can not tell, That is neither heaven nor hell: Where I drink mesmeric gold Of wild vision,âthat romances In informing Protean fancies With a beauty never old, And emotion never cold.â Let me drink and never wake From the trances that environ Me, and 'neath the subtle siren See the demon, like a snake, With destroying eyes that ache. While the slow laconic look Of her eyes express no censure, Gazing in them, I adventure,â Far beyond the wisest book,â Ways her serpent fancy took. Yet I know I reverence One whose gaze in God's negation; One who, like an emanation Of all evil, chains my sense With satanic influence. Yet, while still I hear her say, âOne more kiss before the morning! One more bliss for love's adorning! One more kiss ere break of day,â Still my soul with her must stay. Stay, nor know, nor ever see! Till her basilisk beauty flashes, And the curse, from out the ashes Of her passion, fiery, Strikesâdestroying utterly. LYANNA. âThese elementary beings, we are told, were by their constitution more long-lived than man, but with this essential disadvantage, that at death they wholly ceased to exist. In the meantime they were inspired with an earnest desire for immortality; and there was one way left for them, by which this desire might be gratified. If they were so happy as to awaken in any of the initiated (Rosicrucians) a passion, the end of which was marriage, then the sylph became immortal.ââ Godwin's âLives of the Necromancers.â Summer came over the Indian Ocean Girdled with fire, tiaraed with light; Her eyes all languor, her lipsâa potion To quaffâof poppy. And gold and white She flashed and sparkled; all gleam and motion, All blush and blossom she came; and I, Of the race of the sylphs, o'er the Indian Ocean Followed her through the sky. Self-exiled so from the sylphs that cluster, Pulsing with pearl and burning with blue, In domes of the dawn,âwhere the organs bluster Low of the winds,âwhere they glow like dew As the day dreams up, and their armies muster, Ranges of glitter, in cloudy gold, At the gates of the Dawn, of blinding luster, To forth when her gates unfold. For Summer murmured me, âFollow! follow!â Whispered one word that was all of love.â Winged with the speed of the sweeping swallow, I followed the word she had breathed above: âFollow! follow!ââthe god Apollo Never followed, with speed as strong The flying nymph through holt and hollow, As I that word of song. Fleet as the winds are fleet, yea, and fleeter Far than the stars that throb, like foam, Through the firmament's blue, in musical metre Winnowed my wings; and the golden gloam Rang; and life was a passion, completer Than a life in Eden; and love,âa lyre That sang in my heart and made life sweeter With hope,âa leaping fire. Thus to the north my wings went maying Radiant ways, till a castle shone Gaunt on great cliffs, with the late skies graying O'er walls of war and their towers lone, With tortuous steps to the sea, where, spraying, Thundered the breakers; and terrace and stair, Rock o'er the waters, rose rosy and raying Deep in the sunset's glare. A dewdrop burns when the dawn lights prickle: And all my being tingled with light, Bloomed when I saw her, tarrying fickle, White on the castled height: Slender she shone as the moon in sickle, The slim new-moon, like a pearl-pale streak; And golden, too, as the honey-trickle Of combs where the wax is weak. In dreams I came to her, lo! as a vision: Yea, by her side as a dream I stood; To her innermost spirit I sighed my mission, In the vestal ear of her maidenhood: And she deemed me a dream; and I made a prison Of my arms for her soul while she, smiling, slept: Her body lay still, but her soul had arisen, And looked on my face and wept: âLyanna, I hoop thee with arms of fire!ââ My words were music, a harp afloat,â âLyanna, my heart is a vibrant wire, Thy love is its only note. Let it sing forever. Let it sound entire, Full as the angels' who hover and harp To the glory that 's God, like a golden lyre Borne in a beam that is sharp. ... âBehold me, thy rose! full of flame and splendor! Thy rose to pluck: thy ruby bloom: Thy sylphid rose, with eyes that are tender; Lips that are fire; and limbs of perfume And fragrant fire: thy heart's defender! Thy airy lover!â ... And, bending above, Sweeter my speech than a flower's that, slender, Tells to the stars its love. Lo, as I spoke, with thoughts that thicken, Her heart seemed filled; and she spoke; but sleep Shadowed her words, till my kiss did quicken And free, like stars from the night that leap:â âLong I have waited; and long did sicken To clasp thee thus, O my rose of love! Oft have I dreamed of thee, yea, and was stricken With joy at the thought thereof. âWhite are the clouds; but I saw thee whiter 'Mid dazzling domes of the dawn; and knew Tho' bright are God's stars, that thine eyes were brighter, Brighter and burning blue. And my heart was thine, though it held thee slighter Than hues that the mists of the morning take: And waited and yearned, and the yearning tighter Than tears in the hearts that break. ââLyanna! Lyanna!â I heard thee ever Calling âLyanna,â a ripple of flame: âLyanna! Lyanna!â like song forever; And I marveled at my name. The sound was suchâthat if stars could sever And silver-syllable a word of beams, So would it sound.âI turned; but never Beheld thee, only in dreams. âThou walkedst a beauty afar: a glitter Of gleaming aroma: and I, with moan, Reached thee my arms: but thy gaze was bitter, Calmer and sterner than stone: Avoiding thou passedst in scorn: a sitter, I seemed, on the uttermost bounds of bliss: When, lo! on the wind,âa flame, a flitter Of fire,âthy laugh, and thy kiss!ââ I had won her love. And, behold! the thunder Trumpeted tempest: I heard the seas Lunge at the walls like a roaring wonder, And the rain-wind sing in the trees.â Lyanna my bride.âAnd the heavens asunder Rushedâchasms of glaring storm, where poured The thunder's cataracts, rolling underâ And showed me, horde on horde, The shouting spirits of storm.âThe portal Of sleep was riven; she rose, and saw: And I said to her soul, âOf the utterly mortal Mine the eternal lot and law.ââ âI love thee!â she answered.âAnd I, âImmortal Am I through thy love!â ... And so we fled. ... Behold! when they came in the morn, astartle, Men whisperedââLyanna is dead!â THE SPIRITS OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS Voices of Darkness Ere the birth of Death and of Time, And of Hell, with its tears and its torments: Ere the waves of heat and of rime, And the winds to the heavens were as garments: Cloud-like in the womb of Space, Mist-like from her monster womb, We sprang, a myriad race Of thunder and tempest and gloom. Voices of Light As from the evil good Springs, and desire: As the white lily's hood Buds from the mire: So from this midnight brood Sprang we with fire. Voices of Darkness We had lain for long ages asleep In her bosom, a bulk of torpor, When down through the vasts of the deep Clove a sound, like the notes of a harper: Clove a sound, and the horrors grew Tumultuous with turbulent night, With whirlwinds of blackness that blew, And storm that was godly in might. And the walls of our dungeon were shattered Like the crust of a fire-wrecked world: As torrents of clouds that are scattered, From the womb of the deep we were hurled. Voices of Light Us in unholy thought Patiently lying, EÃ¶ns of violence wrought, Violence defying; When, on a mighty wind, Voiced of a godly mind, Big with a motive kind, Girdled with wonder, Flame and a strength of song, Rolling vast light along, Thundered the Word, and Wrong Vanished,âand we were strong, Strong as the thunder. Voices of Darkness We people the lower spaces, Where our cities of silence make scorn Of the sun, and our shadowy faces Are safe from the splendors of morn. Our homes are wrecked worlds and each planet Whose sun is a light that is sped; Bleak moons, whose cold bodies of granite Are hollow and flameless and dead. Voices of Light We in the living sun Live like a passion: Ere the sad Earth begun We and the sun were one, As God did fashion. Lo! from our burning hands, Flung like inspired brands, Sowed we the worlds, like sands, Countless as ocean: And 'tis our breath gives life, Life to those stars, all rife With iridescent strife, Music and motion. Voices of Darkness We joy in the hate of all mortals; Inspire their crimes and the thought That falters and halts at the portals Of actions, intentions unwrought. We cover the face of to-morrow: We frown in the hours that be: We breathe in the presence of sorrow: And death and destruction are we. Voices of Light We are man's hope and ease, Joy and his pleasure; Authors of love and peace, Love that shall never cease, Free as the azure. Lo! we but look, and light Heartens the world with might, Vanquishes death and night Hate and its burnings: And from our bosoms stream Beauty and yearnings For a diviner dream, Higher discernings. Voices of the Break of Day Morning and birth are ours; Light that is blown From our fair lips; and flowers, Dropped from our hands in showers, Seeds that are sown: Song and the bursting buds, Life of the fields and floods; Strength that's full-grown: And, from our beryl jars, Filled with the clouds and stars, Pour we the winds and dew; While by our eyes of blue Darkness is rent in two, Conquered and strown. Voices of the Dawn Ye in your darkness are Dark and infernal; Subject to death and mar! But in the spaces far, Like our effulgent star, We are eternal. THE WATER WITCH See! the milk-white doe is wounded. He will follow as it bounds Through the woods. His horn has sounded, Echoing, for his men and hounds. But no answering bugle blew. He has lost his retinue For the shapely deer that bounded Past him when his bow he drew. Not one hound or huntsman follows. Through the underbrush and moss Goes the slot; and in the hollows Of the hills, that he must cross, He has lost it. He must fare Over rocks where she-wolves lair; Wood-pools where the wild-boar wallows: So he leaves his hunter there. Through his mind then flashed an olden Legend told him by the monks:â Of a girl, whose hair is golden, Haunting fountains and the trunks Of the woodlands; who, they say, Is a white doe all the day, But when woods are night-enfolden Turns into an evil fay. Then the story once his teacher Told him: of a mountain lake Demons dwell in; vague of feature, Human-like; but each a snake, She is queen of.âDid he hear Laughter at his startled ear? Or a bird?âAnd now, what creature Is it,âor the wind,âstirs near? Fever of the hunt! This water, Falling here, will cool his head. Through the forest, dyed in slaughter, Slants the sunset; ruby-red Are the drops that slip between Hollowed hands, while on the green,â Like the couch of some wild daughter Of the forest,âhe doth lean. But the runnel, bubbling, dripping, Seems to bid him to be gone; As with crystal words and tripping Steps of sparkle luring on. Now a spirit in the rocks Calls him; now a face that mocks, From behind some boulder slipping, Laughs at him through lilied locks. And he follows through the flowers, Blue and gold, that blossom there; Thridding twilight-haunted bowers Where each ripple seems the bare Beauty of white limbs that gleam Rosy through the running stream; Or bright-shaken hair, that showers Starlight in the sunset's beam. Till, far in the forest, sleeping Like a luminous darkness, lay A deep water, wherein, leaping, Fell the Fountain of the Fay, With a singing, sighing sound, As of spirit things around, Musically laughing, weeping In the air and underground. Not a ripple o'er it merried: Like the round moon in a cloud, In its rocks the lake lay buried: And strange creatures seemed to crowd Its dark depths: dim limbs and eyes To the surface seemed to rise Spawn-like; or, all formless, ferried Through the water shadow-wise. Foliage things with woman faces, Demon-dreadful, pale and wild As the forms the lightning traces On the clouds the storm has piled In the darkness.âOn the strandâ What is that which now doth stand?â 'Tis a woman: and she places On his arm a spray-white hand. Ah! two mystic worlds of sorrow Were her eyes; her hair, a place Whence the moon its gold might borrow; And a dream of ice her face: Round her hair and throat in rims Pearls of foam hung; and through whims Of her robe, as breaks the morrow, Gleamed the rose-light of her limbs. Who could help but gaze with gladness On such beauty? though within, Deep within the beryl sadness Of those eyes, the serpent sin Seemed to coil.âShe placed her cheek Chilly upon his, and weak With love-longing and its madness Grew he. Then he heard her speak:â âDost thou love me?âââIf surrender Of the soul means love, I love.â âDost not fear me?âââFear?âmore slender Art thou than a wildwood dove. Yet I fearâI fear to lose Thee, thy love.âââAnd thou dost choose Aye to be my heart's defender?ââ âTake me. I am thine to use.â âFollow then.âAh, love, no lowly Home I give thee.ââWith fixed eyes To the water's edge she slowly Drew him. ... Nor did he surmise Who this creature was, until O'er his face the foam closed chill, Whispering, and the lake unholy Rippled, rippled and was still. THE SUCCUBA I have dreams where I believe That a queen of some dim palace, One, whose name is Genevieve, Weighs me with her love or malice: She is dead and yet my bride: And she glimmers at my side Offering a crystal chalice Filled with fire, diamond-dyed. I have dreams. Ah, would that I Might forget them!âI remember How her gaze, all icily Draws me, like a glowing ember, Up her castle-stair's pale-paved Alabaster, from the waved Ocean, grayer than November, Where I linger, soul-enslaved. Walls of shadow and of night Lit with casements full of fire, Somber red or piercing white: As the wind breathes lower, higher, Round the towers spirit-things Whisper, and the haunted strings Moan of each huge, plangent lyre Set upon its four chief wings. In its corridors at tryst Flame-eyed phantoms meet. Its sparry Halls are misty amethyst: Battlemented 'neath the starry Skies it looms; the strange unknown Skies where, green as glow-worms, sown, Gloom the stars; the moon hangs barry Beryl, low and large and lone. ... Can it be a witch is she? Or a vampire? she, far whiter Than the spirits of the sea!â She whose eyes are cold, yet brighter Than her throat's pale jewels. Lo! Flame she is though seeming snow: And her love lies tighter, tighter On my heart than utter woe. Though I dream, it seems I live; And my heart is sick with sorrow Of the love that it must give To her; passion, it must borrow Of herself, unhallowed, vain; Then return it her again: Thus she holds me; and to-morrow Still will hold with sweetest pain. In her garden's moon-white space Strangest flowers bloom: huge lilies, Each one with a human face; Knots of spirit-amaryllis; Cactus-bulks with pulpy blooms Gnome-like in the silver glooms; And dim deeps of daffadillies, Fay-like, brimming faint perfumes. But to me their fragrance seems Poison; and their lambent lustre, Spun of twilight and of dreams, Poison; and each pearly cluster Hides a serpent's fang. And I, Looking from an oriel, sigh; For my soul is fain to muster Heart to breathe of them and die. Then I feel big eyes, as bright As the sea-stars. Gray with glitter, She behind me, moony white, Smiles, 'mid hangings wherein flitter Loves and deeds of Amadis Darkly worked. And then her kiss On my mouth falls; sweet and bitter With a bliss that is not bliss. And I kiss her eyes and hair; Smooth her tresses till their golden Glimmer sparkles. Everywhere Shapes of strange aromas, holden Of the walls, around us troop; And in golden loop on loop,â Of the lull'd eyes vague beholden,â Forms of music o'er us stoop. Yet I see beneath it all, All this sorcery, a devil, Beautiful, and white, and tall, Broods with shadowy eyes of evil: She, who must resume with morn Her true shape: a cactus-thorn, Monstrous, on some lonely level Of that demon-world forlorn. I have dreams where I believe That a queen of some dim palace, One, whose name is Genevieve, Weighs me with her love or malice: And all night I am her slave There beside the demon wave, Where I drain the loathsome chalice Of her love, that is my grave. MASKS Cucullus non facit monachum Live it down! as you have spoken You could live it ere you knew What love wasââa bauble broken, Foolish, of a thing untrue.ââ You, Viola, with your beauty, Cloistered, die a nun? No! youâ You must wed: it is your duty. There's your poniard; for the second In this tazza dropped: the blood On it scarcely hard. ... I reckoned Happily that hour we stood There upon your palace-stairway, How, with the Franciscan hood Cowled, I said, there was a bare way. In the minster there I found itâ Our revenge. I saw him, wild, Stalking towards the church: around it Dogged him, marking how he smiled In the moonlight where I waited. When the great clock, beating, dialed Ten, I knew he would be mated. Heaven or my better devil!â Hardly had his sword and plume Vanished in the dark, when, level On the long lagoon, did loom, Under moonlight-woven arches, Her slim gondola: all gloom: One tall gondolier: no torches. Dusky gondolas kept bringing Revellers: and far the night Rang with instruments and singing.â From the imbricated light Of the oar-vibrating water, Gliding up the stairway, white, Velvet-masked,âthe count's own daughter! Quick I met her: whispered, âFlora, Gaston.âMia, till they go, One brief moment here, Siora.â She'll perceive usâshe, below, See! the duchess' diamonds sparkling Round the inviolable glow Of her throatâthere, dimly darkling: âThat's Viola!â ... Thus I drew her In the church's ancient pileâ Under her black mask I knew her, By her chin, her lips, her smile. Through one marble-foliated Window fell the moon-rays. While All the maskers passed we waited. I had drawn the dagger. Turning Called her by her name. Some lie Of a passion sighed, her burning Hand in mine; when, stalking by, In the square, his form bejeweled Gleamed. My very blood burned dry With the hate his presence fueled. Our revenge! up-pushing slightly Cowl, the mask fell, and revealed Balka, as the poniard whitely Flashed. The hollow nave re-pealed One long shriek the loft repeated. Swift, I stabbed her thrice. She reeled Dead. I thought of you, the heated Horror on my hands; and tarried Still as silence. Drawn aside On her face the mask hung, married To its camphor-pallor: wide Eyes with terrorâstone. One second I regretted; then defied All remorse. Your promise beckoned; And I left her. Love had pointed Me this way. I walked the way Clear-eyed and ... it has anointed Us fast lovers?âDo not say, Now, that you will go and nun it! For this man who scorned you?âNay!â Live to hate him! You've begun it. CARMEN La Gitanilla, tall dragoons In Andalusian afternoons, With ogling eye and compliment, Smiled on you as along you went Some sleepy street of old Seville; Twirled with a military skill Moustaches; buttoned uniforms Of Spanish yellow bowed your charms. Proud, wicked head, and hair blue-black, Whence the mantilla, half thrown back, Discovered shoulders and bold breast Bohemian brown. And you were dressed In some short skirt of gypsy red Of smuggled stuff; and stockings,âdead White silk,âthat, worn with many a hole, Let the plump leg peep through; while stole, Now in, now out, your dainty toes, Sheathed in morocco shoes, with bows Of scarlet ribbon.âFlirtingly You walked by me; and I did see Your oblique eyes, your sensuous lip That gnawed the rose I saw you flip At bashful JosÃ©'s nose while loud The gaunt guards laughed among the crowd. And in your brazen chemise thrust, Heaved with the swelling of your bust, A bunch of white acacia blooms Whiffed past my nostrils hot perfumes. As in a cool neveria I ate an ice with MÃ©rimÃ©e, Dark Carmencita, very gay You passed, with light and lissome tread, All holiday bedizenÃ©d; A new mantilla on your head: Your crimson dress gleamed, spangled fierce; And crescent gold, hung in your ears, Shone, wrought Morisco; and each shoe, Of Cordovan leather, buckled blue, Glanced merriment; and from large arms To well-turned ankles all your charms Blew flutterings and glitterings Of satin bands and beaded strings: Around each tight arm, twisted gold Coiled serpents, and, a single fold, Wreathed wrists; each serpent's jeweled head, With rubies set, convulsive red. In flowers and trimmings, to the jar Of mandolin and gay guitar, You in the grated patio Danced: the curled coxcombs' staring row Rang pleased applause. I saw you dance, With wily motion and glad glance, Voluptuous, the wild romalis, Where every movement was a kiss, A song, a poem, interwound With your Basque tambourine's dull sound. I,âas the ebon castanets Clucked out dry time in unctuous jets,â Saw angry JosÃ© through the grate Glare on us, a pale face of hate, When some indecent officer Presumed too lewdly to you there. Some still night in Seville: the street Candilejo: two shadows meet: Swift sabres flash within the moonâ Clash rapidly.âA dead dragoon. AT NINEVEH There was a princess once, who loved the slave Of an Assyrian king, her father; known At Nineveh as Hadria; o'er whose grave The sands of centuries have long been blown; Yet sooner shall the night forget its stars Than love her story:âHow, unto his throne, One day she came, where, with his warriors, The King sat in his hall of audience, 'Mid pillared trophies of barbaric wars, And, kneeling to him, asked, âO father, whence Comes love and why?ââHe, smiling on her said,â âO Hadria, love is of the gods, and hence Divine, is only soul-interpreted. But why love is, ah, child, we do not know, Unless 't is love that gives us life when dead.ââ And then his daughter, with a face aglow With all the love that clamored in her blood Its sweet avowal, lifted arms of snow, And, like Aurora's rose, before him stood, Saying,ââSince love is of the powers above, I love a slave, O Asshur!âLet the good The gods have giv'n be sanctioned.âSpeak not of Dishonor and our line's ancestral dead! They are imperial dust. I live and love.ââ Black as black storm then rose the King and said,â A lightning gesture sweeping at her there,â âEnough! ho, Rhana, strike me off her head!â And at the mandate, with his limbs half bare A slave strode forth. Majestic was his form As some young god's. He, gathering up her hair, Wound it three times around his sinewy arm; Then drew his sword. It for one moment shone A semicircling light, and, dripping warm, Lifting the head he stood before the throne. Then said the despot, âBy the horn of Bel! This was no child of mine!ââLike chiseled stone Stern stood the slave, a son of Israel. Then striding towards the monarch, in his eye The wrath of heaven and the hate of hell, Shrieked, âBeast! I loved her! look on us and die!â Swifter than fire clove him to the brain. Then kissed her face, and, holding it on high, Cried out, âJudge thou, O God, between us twain!â And, fifty daggers in his heart, fell slain. SENORITA An agate black, her roguish eyes Claim no proud lineage of the skies, No starry blue; but of good earth The reckless witchery and mirth. Looped in her raven hair's repose, A hot aroma, one red rose Droops; envious of that loveliness, Through being near which, its is less. Twin sea-shells hung with pearls, her ears; Whose delicate rosiness appears Part of the pearls; whose pallid fire Binds the attention these inspire. One slim hand crumples up the lace About her bosom's swelling grace; A ruby at her samite throat Lends the required color-note. The moon brings up the violet night An urn of pearly-chaliced light; And from the dark-railed balcony She stoops and waves her fan at me. O'er orange blossoms and the rose Vague, odorous lips the South Wind blows, Peopling the night with whispers of Romance and palely passionate love. And now she speaks; and seems to reach My soul like song that learned its speech From some dim instrumentâwho knows?â Or flow'r, a dulcimer or rose. SINCE THEN I found myself among the trees What time the reapers ceased to reap; And in the sunflower-blooms the bees Huddled brown heads and went to sleep, Rocked by the balsam-breathing breeze. I saw the red fox leave his lair, A shaggy shadow, on the knoll; And, tunnelling his thoroughfare Beneath the soil, I watched the moleâ Stealth's own self could not take more care. I heard the death-moth tick and stir, Slow-honeycombing through the bark; I heard the cricket's drowsy chirr, And one lone beetle burr the darkâ The sleeping woodland seemed to purr. And then the moon rose: and a white Low bough of blossomsâgrown almost Where, ere you died, 't was our delight To tryst,âdear heart!âI thought your ghost: âThe wood is haunted since that night. AFTER DEATH At moonset, when ghost speaks with ghost And spirits meet where once they sinned, Between the whispering wood and coast, My soul met her soul on the wind, My late-lost Evalind. I kissed her mouth. Her face was wild. Two burning shadows were her eyes, Wherein the love,âthat once had smiled A heartbreak smile,âin some strange wise, I did not recognize. Then suddenly I seemed to see How sin had damned my soul and doomed To wander thus eternally With love and loathing, that assumed The form of her entombed. THE OLD MAN DREAMS The blackened walnut in its spicy hull Rots where it fell; And, in the orchard, where the trees stand full, The pear's brown bell Drops; and the log-house in the bramble lane, From whose low door Stretch yellowing acres of the corn and cane, He sees once more. The cat-bird sings upon its porch of pine; And o'er its gate, All slender-podded, twists the trumpet-vine Its leafy weight: And in the woodland, by the spring, mayhap, With eyes of joy Again he bends to set a rabbit-trap, A brown-faced boy. Then, whistling, through the underwoods he goes, Out of the wood, Where, with young cheeks, red as an autumn rose, In gingham hood, His sweetheart waits, her school-books on her arm: And now it seems Beside his chair bends down his wife's fair formâ The old man dreams. MEMORIES Here where Love lies perishÃ©d, Look not in upon the dead, Lest the shadowy curtains, shaken In my Heart's dark chamber, waken Ghosts, beneath whose garb of sorrow Whilom gladness bows his head: When you come at morn, to-morrow, Look not in upon the dead, Here where Love lies perishÃ©d. Here where Love lies cold interred, Let no syllable be heard, Lest the hollow echoes, housing In my Soul's deep tomb, arousing Wake a voice of woe, once laughter Claimed and clothed in joy's own word: When you come at dusk, or after, Let no syllable be heard, Here where Love lies cold interred. MARCH AND MAY Windy the sky and mad; Surly the gray March day; Bleak the forests and sad,â Oh, that it only were May! On maples, tasseled with red, No blithe bird, fluting, swung; The brook, in its swollen bed, Raved on in an unknown tongue. We walked in the wind-tossed wood: Her face as the May's was fair; Her blood was the May's own blood; And May's her radiant hair. And we found in the woodland wild One cowering violet, Like a frail and timorous child, In the caked leaves bowed and wet. And I said, âWe have walked in vain! To find but this shivering bud, Weighed down with its weight of rain, Crouched here in the wild March wood.â But she said, âThough the day be sad, And the skies be dark with fate, There is always something glad That will help our hearts to wait. âLook, now, at this beautiful thing, In this wood's wild hollow curled! 'Tis a promise of joy and spring, And of love, to the waiting world. âAh, the sinless Earth is fair, And man's are the sin and the gloomâ Come, bury the days that were, And look to'ard the days to come!â And the May came on with her charms, With twinkle and rustle of feet; Blooms stormed from her luminous arms, And songs that were wildly sweet. Now I think of her words that day, This day that I longed so to see, That finds her dead with the May, And my life but a withered tree. IN AUTUMN I Sunflowers wither and lilies die, Poppies are pods of seeds; The first red leaves on the pathway lie, Like blood of a heart that bleeds. Weary alway will it be to-day, Weary and wan wet; Dawn and noon will the clouds hang gray, And the autumn wind will sigh and say, âHe comes not yet, not yet, Weary alway, alway!â II Hollyhocks bend all tattered and torn, Marigolds all are gone; The last pale rose lies all forlorn, Like love that is trampled on. Weary, ah me! to-night will be, Weary and wild and hoar; Rain and mist will blow from the sea, And the wind will sob in the autumn tree, âHe comes no more, no more. Weary, ah me! ah me!â âWHEN SHE DRAWS NEARâ I When she draws near, I seem to hear The shy approach of some wild innocence: As ifâin acorn crownâ A dryad should step down From some dim oak-tree where the woods are dense. II When she's with me, I seem to see The brambles blossom where just touched her dress: As, with her love's perfume, She touches into bloom The thorns of life and gives them loveliness. REED CALL FOR APRIL I When April comes, and pelts with buds And apple-blooms each orchard space, And takes the dogwood-whitened woods With rain and sunshine of her moods, Like your fair face, like your sweet face: It's honey for the bud and dew, And honey for the heart! And, oh, to be away with you Beyond the town and mart. II When April comes and tints the hills With gold and beryl that rejoice, And from her airy apron spills The laughter of the winds and rills, Like your young voice, like your sweet voice: It's gladness for God's bending blue, And gladness for the heart! And, oh, to be away with you Beyond the town and mart. III When April comes, and binds and girds The world with warmth that breathes above, And to the breeze flings all her birds, Whose songs are welcome as the words Of you I love, O you I love: It's music for all things that woo, And music for the heart! And, oh, to be away with you Beyond the town and mart. HER VIOLIN I Her violin!âAgain begin The dream-notes of her violin; And tall and fair, with gold-brown hair, I seem to see her standing there, Soft-eyed and sweetly slender: The room again, with strain on strain, Vibrates to Love's melodious pain, As, sloping slow, is poised her bow, While round her form the golden glow Of sunset spills its splendor. II Her violin!âNow deep, now thin, Again I hear her violin; And, dream by dream, again I seem To see the love-light's tender gleam Beneath her eyes' long lashes: While to my heart she seems a part Of her pure song's inspired art; And, as she plays, the rosy grays Of twilight halo hair and face, While sunset burns to ashes. III O violin!âCease, cease within My soul, O haunting violin! In vain, in vain, you bring again, Back from the past, the blissful pain Of all the love then spoken; When on my breast, at happy rest, A sunny while her head was pressedâ Peace, peace to these wild memories! For, like my heart naught remedies, Her violin lies broken. MEETING IN SUMMER A tranquil bar Of rosy twilight under dusk's first star. A glimmering sound Of whispering waters over grassy ground. A sun-sweet smell Of fresh-reaped hay from dewy field and dell. A lazy breeze Jostling the ripeness from the apple-trees. A vibrant cry, Passing, then gone, of bullbats in the sky. And faintly now The katydid upon the shadowy bough. And far off then The little owl within the lonely glen. And soon, full soon, The silvery arrival of the moon. And, to your door, The path of roses I have trod before. And, sweetheart, you! Among the roses and the moonlit dew. HER VIVIEN EYES Her Vivien eyes,âbeware! beware!â Though they be stars, a deadly snare They set beneath her night of hair. Regard them not! lest, drawing nearâ As sages once in old Chaldeeâ Thou shouldst become a worshiper, And they thy evil destiny. Her Vivien eyes,âaway! away!â Though they be springs, remorseless they Gleam underneath her brow's bright day. Turn, turn aside, whate'er the cost! Lest in their deeps thou lures behold, Through which thy captive soul were lost, As was young Hylas once of old. Her Vivien eyes,âtake heed! take heed!â Though they be bibles, none may read Therein of God or Holy Creed. Look, look away! lest thou be cursed,â As Merlin was, romances tell,â And in their sorcerous spells immersed, Hoping for Heaven thou chance on Hell. REASONS I Yea, why I love thee let my heart repeat: I look upon thy face and then divine How men could die for beauty, such as thine,â Deeming it sweet To lay my life and manhood at thy feet, And for a word, a glance, Do deeds of old romance. II Yea, why I love thee let my heart unfold: I look into thy heart and then I know The wondrous poetry of the long-ago, The Age of Gold, That speaks strange music, that is old, so old, Yet young, as when 't was born, With all the youth of morn. III Yea, why I love thee let my heart conclude: I look into thy soul and realize The undiscovered meaning of the skies,â That long have wooed The world with far ideals that elude,â Out of whose dreams, maybe, God shapes reality. HER VESPER SONG The summer lightning comes and goes In one white cloud above the hill, As if within its soft repose A burning heart were never stillâ As in my bosom pulses beat Before the coming of his feet. All drugged with odorous sleep, the rose Breathes dewy balm about the place, As if the dreams the garden knows Arose, in immaterial graceâ As in my heart sweet thoughts arise Beneath the ardour of his eyes. The moon above the darkness shows An orb of silvery snow and fire, As if the night would now disclose To heav'n her one divine desireâ As in the rapture of his kiss All my glad soul is drawn to his. The cloud divines not that it glows; The rose knows nothing of its scent; Nor knows the moon that it bestows Light on our earth and firmamentâ So is the soul unconscious of The beauties it reveals through love. THE GLORY AND THE DREAM There in the past I see her as of old, Blue-eyed and hazel-haired, within a room Dim with a twilight of tenebrious gold; Her white face sensuous as a delicate bloom Night opens in the tropics. Fold on fold Pale laces drape her; and a frail perfume, As of a moonlit lily brimmed with rain, Breathes from her presence, drowsing heart and brain. Her head is bent; some red carnations glow Deep in her heavy hair; her large eyes gleam;â Bright sister stars of those twin worlds of snow, Her breasts, through which the veinÃ©d violets stream.â I hold her hand; her smile comes sweetly slow As thoughts of love that haunt a poet's dream: And at her feet once more I sit and hear Wild words of passionâdead this many a year. SNOW AND FIRE Deep-hearted roses of the purple dusk And lilies of the morn; And cactus, holding up a slender tusk Of fragrance on a thorn; All heavy flowers, sultry with their musk, Her presence puts to scorn. For she is like the pale, pale snowdrop there, Scentless and chaste of heart; The moonflower, making spiritual the air, Like some pure work of art; Divine and holy, exquisitely fair, And virtue's counterpart. Yet when her eyes gaze into mine, and when Her lips to mine are pressed,â Why are my veins all fire then? and then Why should her soul suggest Voluptuous perfumes, maddening unto men, And prurient with unrest? IN MAY I When you and I in the hills went Maying, You and I in the bright May weather, The birds, that sang on the boughs together, There in the green of the woods, kept saying All that my heart was saying low, âI love you! love you!â soft and low;â And did you know? When you and I in the hills went Maying. II There where the brook on its rocks went winking, There by its banks where the May had led us, Flowers, that bloomed in the woods and meadows, Azure and gold at our feet, kept thinking All that my soul was thinking there, âI love you! love you!â softly there;â And did you care? There where the brook on its rocks went winking. III Whatever befalls through fate's compelling, Should our paths unite or our pathways sever, In the Mays to-come I shall feel forever The wildflowers thinking, the wild-birds telling, In words as soft as the falling dew, The love that I keep here still for you, As deep and true, Whatever befalls through fate's compelling. âWERE I AN ARTISTâ Were I an artist, Lydia, I Would paint you as you merit, Not as my eyes, but dreams descry; Not in the flesh, but spirit. The canvas I would paint you on Should be a strip of heaven; My brush, a sunbeam; pigments, dawn And night and starry even. Your form and features to express Likewise your soul's chaste whiteness, I'd take the primal essences Of darkness and of brightness. I'd take pure night to paint your hair; Stars for your eye; and morning To paint your skinâthe rosy air Which is your limbs' adorning. To paint the love-bows of your lips, I'd mix, for colors, kisses; And for your breasts and finger-tips, Sweet odors and soft blisses. And to complete the picture well, I'd temper all with woman,â Some tears, some laughter; heaven and hell, To show you yet are human. THE RIDE She rode o'er hill, she rode o'er plain, She rode by fields of barley, By morning-glories filled with rain, Along the wood-side gnarly. She rode o'er plain, she rode o'er hill, By orchard land and berry; Her eyes were sparkling as the rill, Cheeks, redder than the cherry. A bird sang here, a bird sang there, Then blithely sang together; Sang sudden greeting everywhere, âGood-morrow!â and âGood weather!â The sunlight's laughing radiance Laughed in her radiant tresses; The bold breeze made her wild curls dance, And flushed her face with kisses. THE RIDE âWhy ride you here, why ride you there, Why ride you here so merry? The sunlight living in your hair, And in your cheek the berry? âWhy ride you with your sea-green plumes, Your sea-green silken habit, By balmy bosks of faint perfumes, And haunts of roe and rabbit?â âThe morning ploughed the east with gold, And planted it with holly; And I was young and he was old, And rich, and melancholy. âA wife they 'd have me to his bed, And to the church they hurried; But now, gramercy! he is dead! Thank God! is dead and buried. âI ride by tree, I ride by rill, I ride by rye and clover, For by the church beyond the hill Awaits my first true lover.â AT PARTING What is there left for us to say, Now it is time to speak good-by? And all our dreams of yesterday Are one with yester-evening's skyâ What is there left for us to say, Now different ways before us lie? A word of hope, a word of cheer, A word of love, whose help shall last, When we are far to bring us near Through memories of the happy past; A word of hope, a word of cheer, To keep our young hearts true and fast. What is there left for us to do, Now it is time to say farewell? And care, that bade us once adieu, Returns again with us to dwellâ What is there left for us to do, Now different ways our fates compel? Clasp hands and kiss, touch lips and smile, And look the love that shall remainâ When severed so by many a mileâ The sweetest balm for bitterest pain: Clasp hands and kiss, touch lips and smile, And trust to God to meet again. IN THE GARDEN OF GIRLS Serious, but smiling, stately and serene, And lovelier than a flower, She stands; in whom all sympathies convene As perfumes in a bower; Through whom I feel what soul and heart must mean, And all their love and power. Eyes, that commune with the frank skies of truth, Beneath their cloud-like curls; Lips of immortal rose, where joy and youth Nestle like priceless pearls; Hair, that suggests the Bible braids of Ruth, Deeper than any girl's. When first I saw her, 't was as if within My gaze took shape some songâ Played by a master of the violinâ A music, pure and strong, That rapt my soul above all earthly sin To heights that know no wrong. âCOME TO THE HILLSâ Come to the hills, the woods are greenâ The heart is high when lovers meetâ There is a brook that flows between Mossed rocks where we will make our seat, Where we will sit and speak unseen. I hear you laughing in the laneâ The heart is high when lovers meetâ The clover smells of sun and rain And spreads a carpet for our feet, Where we will walk and dream again. Come to the woods, the dusk is hereâ The heart is high when lovers meetâ A bird upon the branches near Sets music to our hearts' sweet beat, Our hearts that beat with something dear. I hear your step; the lane is passedâ The heart is high when lovers meetâ The little stars come bright and fast, Like happy eyes that watch us, Sweet, That see us greet and kiss at last. EVASION I Why do I love you, who have never given My heart encouragement or any cause? Is it because, as earth is held of heaven, Your soul holds mine by some mysterious laws? Perhaps, unseen of me, within your eyes The answers lies. II From your sweet lips no word hath ever fallen To tell my heart its love is not in vainâ The bee that woos the flow'r hath honey and pollen To cheer him on and bring him back again: But what have I, your other friends above, To feed my love? III Still, still you are my dream and my desire; Your love is an allurement and a dare Set for attainment, like a shining spire, Far, far above me in the starry air: And gazing upward, 'gainst the hope of hope, I breast the slope. WILL YOU FORGET? In years to come, will you forget, Dear girl, how often we have met? And I have gazed into your eyes And there beheld no sad regret To cloud the gladness of their skies, While in your heartâunheard as yetâ Love slept, oblivious of my sighs?â In years to come, will you forget? Ah, me! I only pray that when, In other days, some man of men Has taught those eyes to laugh and weep With joy and sorrow, hearts must ken When love awakens in their deep,â I only pray some memory then, Or sad or sweet, you still will keep Of me and love that might have been. CONTRASTS No eve of summer ever can attain The gladness of that eve of late July, When 'mid the roses, dripping with the rain, Against the wondrous topaz of the sky, I met you, leaning on the pasture bars,â While heaven and earth grew conscious of the stars. No night of blackest winter can repeat The bitterness of that December night, When, at your gate, gray-glittering with sleet, Within the glimmering square of window-light, We parted,âlong you clung unto my arm,â While heaven and earth surrendered to the storm. CARISSIMA MEA I look upon my sweetheart's face, And, in the world about me, see No face like hers in any place. It is not made, as others sing Of their young loves, like ivory, But like a wild-rose in the spring. Her brow is low and very fair, And o'er it, smooth and shadowy, Lies deep the darkness of her hair. Beneath her brows her eyes gleam gray, And gaze out glad and fearlesslyâ Their wonder haunts me night and day. Her eyebrows, arched and delicate,â Twin curves of penciled ebony,â Within their spans contain my fate. Her mouth, that was for kisses curved,â So small and sweet!âit well may be That it for me is yet reserved. Between her hair and rounded chin, Calm with her soul's calm purity, There lies no shadow of a sin. Of perfect form, she is not tall,â Just higher than the heart of me, O'er which I place her, all in all. She is not shaped, as some have sung Of their young loves, like some slim tree, But like the moon when it is young. Her hands, that smell of violet, So white and fashioned fragrantly, Have woven round my heart a net. Yea, I have loved her many a day; And though for me she may not be, Still at her feet my love I lay. Albeit she be not for me, God send her grace and grant that she Know naught of sorrow all her days, And help me still to sing her praise! AN AUTUMN NIGHT Some things are good on autumn nights, When with the storm the forest fights, And in the room the heaped hearth lights Old-fashioned press and rafter: Plump chestnuts hissing in the heat, A mug of cider, sharp and sweet, And at your side a face petite, With lips of laughter. Upon the roof the rolling rain, And, tapping at the window-pane, The wind that seems a witch's cane That summons spells together: A hand within your own a while; A mouth reflecting back your smile; And eyes, two stars, whose beams exile All thoughts of weather. And, while the wind lulls, still to sit And watch her fire-lit needles flit A-knitting, and to feel her knit Your very heart-strings in it: Then, when the old clock ticks â't is late,â To rise, and at the door to wait Two words, or, at the garden-gate, A kissing minute. A DAUGHTER OF THE STATES She has the eyes of some barbarian Queen Leading her wild tribes into battle; eyes, Wherein th' unconquerable soul defies, And Love sits throned, imperious and serene. And I have thought that Liberty, alone Among her mountain stars, might look like her, Kneeling to God, her only emperor, Kindling her torch on Freedom's altar-stone. For in her self, regal with riches of Beauty and youth, again those Queens seem bornâ Boadicea, meeting scorn with scorn, And Ermengarde, returning love for love. THE QUARREL An instant only and her eyes Flashed lightning like the angry skies; And o'er her forehead, curving down, Fell dark the shadow of a frown; Then backward, deep and stormy fair, She tossed the tempest of her hair; Then of her lips' full rose disdain Made a pink-folded bud again; Then quicker than all utterance, All changed: and at a word, a glance, Her anger rained its tears, then passed; And she was in my arms at last; The austere woman, doubly dear, And lovelier for each falling tear: But why we quarreled, how it grew, I can not tell, I never knew: Perhaps 't was Love; he, who, with tears, Would show how fair a face appears; As, after storm, the sky's more blue, A wildflower 's fairer for the dew. MIRIAM What better praise for all her ways Than that all days her ways illume? Such brightness as the maiden year Knows, when God's kindness seems as near As flowers whose wisdom 's but to bloom. Hers the deep hair: a face more fair Than roses June sets blossoming: The sunshine of her gladness gleams In bloom-bright lips and cheeks, and dreams Upon her throat's soft coloring. Her voice is sweet as birds that greet With song the coming of the light: The serious happy gleam that lies In the dark lustre of her eyes Is as the starlight to the night. Beyond the sea such girls as she It was whom Titian loved to paint, With calm Madonna eyes, and hair Rich auburn; robed in gold and vair, Fair as the vision of a saint. THE SUMMER SEA Over the summer sea, When the white-eyed stars look pale, And the moonbeams make a trail Of gold through the waves for me, I turn my ghostly sail Away, away, And follow the form I see Over the summer sea. Over the misty sea, Ere the cliff which highest soars From the billow-beaten shores Reddens all rosily, Where the witch-white water roars, Far on, far on. Through the foam she beckons me Over the summer sea. Over the haunted sea, When the great, gold moon low lies On the rim of the western skies, 'Twixt the moon, she comes, and me, And gazes in my eyes; Low down, low down, 'Twixt the orbÃ©d moon and me, Over the summer sea. Deep in the bitter sea, Wilt thou drag me down, O sweet? Down, down! from hair to feet Filled with thee utterly? Against thy heart's wild beat?â At last! at last! Wilt drag me down with thee, Deep in the summer sea? FINALE So let it be. Thou dare not say 'twas I!â Here in life's temple, where thy soul can see, Look where the beauty of our love doth lie, Shattered in shards, a dead divinity!â Approach: kneel down: yea, render up one sigh! This is the end. What need to tell it thee! So let it be. So let it be. Care, who hath stood with him, And sorrow, who sat by him deified,â For whom his face made comfort,âlo! how dim They heap his altar which they can not hide, While memory's lamp swings o'er it, burning slim.â This is the end. What shall be said beside? So let it be. So let it be. Did we not drain the wine, Red, of love's sacramental chalice, when He laid sweet sanction on thy lips and mine? Dash it aside! Lo, who will fill again Now it is empty of the god divine!â This is the end. Yea, let us say Amen. So let it be. CONCLUSION The songs Love sang to us are dead: Yet shall he sing to us again, When the dull days are wrapped in lead, And the red woodland drips with rain. The lily of our love is gone, That graced our spring with golden scent: Now in the garden low upon The wind-stripped way its stalk is bent. Our rose of dreams is passed away, That lit our summer with sweet fire: The storm beats bare each thorny spray, And its dead leaves are trod in mire. The songs Love sang to us are dead: Yet shall he sing to us again, When the dull days are wrapped in lead, And the red woodland drips with rain. The marigold of memory Shall fill our autumn then with glow: Haply its bitterness will be Sweeter for love of long-ago. The cypress of forgetfulness Shall haunt our winter with its hue: Its apathy to us not less Dear for the dreams love's summer knew.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Volume III NATURE POEMS PROLOGUE There is a poetry that speaks Through common things: the grasshopper, That in the hot weeds creaks and creaks, Says all of summer to my ear: And in the cricket's cry I hear The fireside speak, and feel the frost Work mysteries of silver near On country casements, while, deep lost In snow, the gatepost seems a sheeted ghost. And other things give rare delight: The guttural harps the green-frogs tune, Those minstrels of the falling night, That hail the sickle of the moon From grassy pools that glass her lune: Or,âall of August in its loud Dry cry,âthe locust's call at noon, That emphasizes heat, no cloud Of lazy white makes less with its cool shroud. The rain,âwhose cloud dark-lids the moon, That great white eyeball of the night,â Makes music for me; to its tune I hear the flowers unfolding white, The mushroom growing, and the slight Green sound of grass that dances near; The melon ripening with delight; And in the orchard, soft and clear, The apple redly rounding out its sphere. The grigs make music as of old, To which the fairies whirl and shine Within the moonlight's prodigal gold, On woodways wild with many a vine: When all the wilderness with wine Of stars is drunk, I hear it sayâ âIs God restricted to confine His wonders only to the day, That yields the abstract tangible to clay?â And to my ear the wind of Morn,â When on her rubric forehead far One star burns big,âlifts a vast horn Of wonder where all murmurs are: In which I hear the waters war, The torrent and the blue abyss, And pines,âthat terrace bar on bar The mountain side,âlike lovers kiss, And whisper words where all of grandeur is. The jutting crags,âdark, iron-veined With ore,âthe peaks, where eagles scream, That pour their cataracts, rainbow-stained, Like hair, in many a mountain stream, Can lift my soul beyond the dream Of all religions; make me scan No mere external or extreme, But inward pierce the outward plan And learn that rocks have souls as well as man. [IN THE SHADOW OF THE BEECHES] IN THE SHADOW OF THE BEECHES In the shadow of the beeches, Where the fragile wildflowers bloom; Where the pensive silence pleaches Green a roof of cool perfume, Have you felt an awe imperious As when, in a church, mysterious Windows paint with God the gloom? In the shadow of the beeches, Where the rock-ledged waters flow; Where the sun's slant splendor bleaches Every wave to foaming snow, Have you felt a music solemn As when minster arch and column Echo organ worship low? In the shadow of the beeches, Where the light and shade are blent; Where the forest-bird beseeches, And the breeze is brimmed with scent,â Is it joy or melancholy That o'erwhelms us partly, wholly, To our spirit's betterment? In the shadow of the beeches Lay me where no eye perceives; Where,âlike some great arm that reaches Gently as a love that grieves,â One gnarled root may clasp me kindly While the long years, working blindly, Slowly change my dust to leaves. A FALLEN BEECH Nevermore at doorways that are barken Shall the madcap wind knock and the moonlight; Nor the circle which thou once didst darken, Shine with footsteps of the neighboring moonlight, Visitors for whom thou oft didst hearken. Nevermore, gallooned with cloudy laces, Shall the morning, like a fair freebooter, Make thy leaves his richest treasure-places; Nor the sunset, like a royal suitor, Clothe thy limbs with his imperial graces. And no more, between the savage wonder Of the sunset and the moon's up-coming, Shall the storm, with boisterous hoof-beats, under Thy dark roof dance, Faun-like, to the humming Of the Pan-pipes of the rain and thunder. Oft the Satyr-spirit, beauty-drunken, Of the Spring called; and the music measure Of thy sap made answer; and thy sunken Veins grew vehement with youth, whose pressure Swelled thy gnarly muscles, winter-shrunken. And the germs, deep down in darkness rooted, Bubbled green from all thy million oilets, Where the spirits, rain and sunbeam suited, Of the April made their whispering toilets, Or within thy stately shadow footed. Oft the hours of blonde Summer tinkled At the windows of thy twigs, and found thee Bird-blithe; or, with shapely bodies, twinkled Lissom feet of naked flowers around thee, Where thy mats of moss lay sunbeam-sprinkled. And the Autumn with his gypsy-coated Troop of days beneath thy branches rested, Swarthy-faced and dark of eye; and throated Songs of hunting; or with red hand tested Every nut-burr that above him floated. Then the Winter, barren-browed, but rich in Shaggy followers of frost and freezing, Made the floor of thy broad boughs his kitchen, Trapper-like, to camp in; grimly easing Limbs snow-furred and moccasined with lichen. Now, alas! no more do these invest thee With the dignity of whilom gladness! Theyâunto whose hearts thou once confessed thee Of thy dreamsânow know thee not! and sadness Sits beside thee where, forgot, dost rest thee. A COIGNE OF THE FOREST The hills hang woods around, where green, below Dark, breezy boughs of beech-trees, mats the moss, Crisp with the brittle hulls of last year's nuts; The water hums one bar there; and a glow Of gold lies steady where the trailers toss Red, bugled blossoms and a rock abuts; In spots the wild-phlox and oxalis grow Where beech-roots bulge the loam, and welt across The grass-grown road and roll it into ruts. And where the sumach brakes grow dusk and dense, Among the rocks, great yellow violets, Blue-bells and windflowers bloom; the agaric In dampness crowds; a fungus, thick, intense With gold and crimson and wax-white, that sets The May-apples along the terraced creek At bold defiance. Where the old rail-fence Divides the hollow, there the bee-bird whets His bill, and there the elder hedge is thick. No one can miss it; for two cat-birds nest, Calling all morning, in the trumpet-vine; And there at noon the pewee sits and floats A woodland welcome; and his very best At eve the red-bird sings, as if to sign The record of its loveliness with notes. At night the moon stoops over it to rest, And unreluctant stars, in whose faint shine There runs a whisper as of wind-swept oats. A HOUSE IN THE HILLS Old hearts that hold the saddest memories Are the most beautiful; and such make sweet Light, happy moods of younger natures which Their sadness contacts and so sanctifies. And such to me is an old gabled house, Deserted, and neglected, and unknown, Lost in the tangled hollow of its hills, Dark, cedared hills, and dreamy orchard-lands; With but its host of shrouded memories Haunting its ruined rooms and desolate halls,â Pathetic with their fallen finery,â And whispering through its cob-webbed crevices And roomy hearths, that sigh with ceaseless wind, Undreamed of things that happened long ago. Here in gray afternoons I love to sit, And hear the running rain along the roof; The creak and crack of noises that are born Of silence or mysterious agencies; The fitful footfalls of the wind adown Grand, winding stairways, massy banistered; A clapping door and then a sudden hush As if the old house held its breath to see,â Invisible to me,âa presence pass, That brings a pleasant terror stiffening through The tingling veins and staring from the eyes. Then comes the rain again along the roof; And in rain-rotted room and rain-stained hall The drip and whisper of the wind and rain Seem viewless footsteps of the sometime lords And mistresses who lived here in the past. And could the state material but assume A state clairvoyant, then the dream-drugged eyes, Perhaps, might see, from room to dusty room, The ghosts of stately gentlemen glide by, And glimmering ladies, all beruffled, trail Long, haughty silks miraculously stiff. THE WIND âWind of the East, if thou pass by the land where my loved ones dwell, I pray, The fullest of greetings bear to them from me, their lover, and say That I am the pledge of passion still.ââ FROM THE ARABIC. The ways of the wind are eerie, And I love them all: The blithe, the mad, and the dreary, Spring, winter, and fall. When it tells to the waiting crocus Its beak to show; And hangs on the wayside locust Bloom-bunches of snow. When it comes like a balmy blessing From the musky wood, The half-grown roses caressing Till their cheeks burn blood. When it roars in the autumn season, And whines with rain, Or sleet, like a mind without reason, Or a soul in pain. When the woodways, once so spicy With bud and bloom, Are desolate, dead and icy As the icy tomb. When the puffed owl, crouched and frowsy, In the hollow tree, Sobs, dolorous, cold, and drowsy, Its shuddering melody. Then I love to sit in December Where the big hearth sings, And, dreaming, forget and remember A host of things. And the windâI hear how it strangles, And wails and sighs On the roof's sharp, shivering angles That front the skies. How it shouts and romps and tumbles In attics o'erhead; In the great-throated chimney rumbles, Then all at once falls dead; Then comes like the footsteps stealing Of a child on the stair, Or a bent, old gentleman feeling His slippered way with care. And my soul grows anxious-hearted For those once dearâ The long-lost loves, departed, In the wind draw near. And I seem to see their facesâ Not one estrangedâ In their old accustomed places Round the wide hearth ranged. And the wind, that waits and poises Where the shadows sway, Seems their visionary voices Calling me far away. Then I wake in tears and hear it Wailing outside my door,â Or is it some wandering spirit Weeping upon the moor? RAIN IN THE WOODS When on the leaves the rain persists, And every gust brings showers down; When copse and woodland smoke with mists, I take the old road out of town Into the hills through which it twists. I find the vale where catnip grows, Where boneset blooms, with moisture bowed; The vale through which the red creek flows, Turbid with hill-washed clay, and loud As some wild horn a huntsman blows. Around the root the beetle glides, A burnished beryl; and the ant, Large, agate-red, a garnet, slides Beneath the rock; and every plant Is roof for some frail thing that hides. Like knots against the trunks of trees The lichen-colored moths are pressed; And, wedged in hollow blooms, the bees Hang pollen-clotted; in its nest The wasp has crawled and lies at ease. The locust harsh, that sharply saws The silence of the summer noon; The katydid, that thinly draws Its fine file o'er the bars of moon; And grasshopper that drills each pause: The mantis, long-clawed, furtive, leanâ Fierce feline of the insect hordesâ And dragonfly, gauze-winged and green, Beneath the wild-grape's leaves and gourd's, Have housed themselves and rest unseen. The butterfly and forest-bird Are huddled on the same gnarled bough, From which, like some rain-voweled word That dampness hoarsely utters now, The tree-toad's guttural voice is heard. I crouch and listen: and again The woods are filled with phantom formsâ With shapes, grotesque in cloudy train, That rise and reach to me cool arms Of mist: dim, wandering wraiths of rain. I see them come; fantastic, fair; Chill, mushroom-colored: sky and earth Grow ghostly with their floating hair And trailing limbs, that have their birth In wetnessâfungi of the air. O wraiths of rain! O ghosts of mist! Still fold me, hold me, and pursue! Still let my lips by yours be kissed! Still draw me with your hands of dew Unto the tryst, the dripping tryst. HEAT I Now is it as if Spring had never been, And Winter but a memory and a dream, Here where the Summer stands, her lap of green Heaped high with bloom and beam, Among her blackberry-lilies, low that lean To kiss her feet; or, freckle-browed, that stare Upon the dragonfly which, slimly seen, Like a blue jewel flickering in her hair, Sparkles above them there. II Knee-deep among the tepid pools the cows Chew a slow cud or switch a slower tail, Half-sunk in sleep beneath the beechen boughs, Where thin the wood-gnats ail. From bloom to bloom the languid butterflies drowse; The sleepy bees make hardly any sound; The only things the sun-rays can arouse, It seems, are two black beetles rolling round Upon the dusty ground. III Within its channel glares the creek and shrinks, Beneath whose rocks the furtive crawfish hides In stagnant places, where the green frog blinks, And water-strider glides. Far hotter seems it for the bird that drinks, The startled kingfisher that screams and flies; Hotter and lonelier for the purples and pinks Of weeds that bloom, whose sultry perfumes rise Stifling the swooning skies. IV From ragweed fallows, rye-fields, heaped with sheaves, From blistering rocks, no moss or lichens crust, And from the road, where every hoof-stroke heaves A cloud of burning dust, The hotness quivers, making limp the leaves, That loll like panting tongues. The pulsing heat Seems a wan wimple that the Summer weaves, A veil, in which she wraps,âas in a sheet,â The shriveling corn and wheat. V Furious, incessant in the weeds and briers The sawing weed bugs sing: and, heat-begot, The grasshoppers, so many strident wires, Staccato stinging hot: A lash of whirling sound that never tires, The locust flails the noon, where harnessed Thirst, Beside the road-spring, many a shod hoof mires, Into the trough thrusts his hot head; immersed, Round which cool bubbles burst. VI The sad, sweet voice of some wood-spirit who Laments while watching a loved oak-tree die, From the deep forest comes the wood-dove's coo, A long, lost, lonely cry.â Oh, for a breeze! a mighty wind to woo The woods to stormy laughter; sow like grain The world with freshness of invisible dew, And pile above far, fevered hill and plain Cloud-bastions, black with rain. YOUNG SEPTEMBER I With a look and a laugh where the stream was flowing, September led me along the land; Where the goldenrod and lobelia, glowing, Seemed burning torches within her hand. And faint as the thistle's or milkweed's feather I glimpsed her form in the sparkling weather. II Now 'twas her hand and now her hair That tossed me welcome everywhere; That lured me onward through the stately rooms Of forest, hung and carpeted with glooms, And windowed wide with azure, doored with green, Through which rich glimmers of her robe were seenâ Now, like some deep marsh-mallow, rosy-gold; Now, like the great Joe-Pye-weed, fold on fold Of heavy mauve; and now, like the intense Massed ironweed, a purple opulence. III Along the bank in a wild procession Of gold and sapphire the blossoms blew; And borne on the breeze came their soft confession In syllabled musk and honey-dew; In words unheard that their lips kept saying, Sweet as the lips of children praying. IV And so, meseemed, I heard them tell How here her loving glance once fell Upon this bank, and from its azure grew The ageratum mist-flower's happy hue; How from her kiss, as crimson as the dawn, The cardinal-flow'r drew its vermilion; And from her hair's blond touch th' elecampane Evolved the glory of its golden rain; While from her starry footsteps, redolent, The aster pearled its flowery firmament. THE VINTAGER Among the fragrant grapes she bows; Long violet clusters heap her hands: And, with bright brows, on him bestows Sweet looks, like soft commands. And from her sunburnt throat, at times, As bubbles burst on new-made wine, A happy fit of merry rhymes Rings down the hills of vine. And in his heart, remorseless, sweet, Grew big the red-grape, passion, there; His heart, that, ever at her feet, Was filled with love's despair. But she, who ne'er the honeyed must Of love had drained, a grown-up child, Saw in himâmerely one to trust, And broke his heart, and smiled. BLACK VESPER'S PAGEANTS The day, all fierce with carmine, turns An Indian face towards Earth and dies; The west, like some gaunt vase, inurns Its ashes under smoldering skies; Athwart whose bowl one red cloud streams, Wild as some dream an Aztec dreams. Now shadows mass above the world, And night comes on with wind and rain; The mulberry-colored leaves are hurled Like frantic hands against the pane. And through the forests, bending low, Night stalks like some gigantic Woe. In hollows where the thistle shakes A hoar bloom like a witch's light, From weed and flower the rain-wind rakes Dead sweetnessâas a wildman might, From autumn leaves, the woods among, Dig some dead woman, fair and young. Now let me walk the woodland ways, Alone! except for thoughts, that are Akin to such wild nights and daysâ A portion of the storm that far Fills Heaven and Earth tumultuously, And my own soul with ecstasy. A TWILIGHT MOTH Dusk is thy dawn; when Eve puts on her state Of gold and purple in the marbled west, Thou comest forth like some embodied trait, Or dim conceit, a lily-bud confessed; Or, of a rose, the visible wish; that, white, Goes softly messengering through the night, Whom each expectant flower makes its guest. All day the primroses have thought of thee, Their golden heads close-haremed from the heat; All day the mystic moonflowers silkenly Veiled snowy faces,âthat no bee might greet Or butterfly that, weighed with pollen, passed;â Keeping Sultana-charms for thee, at last, Their lord, who comest to salute each sweet. Cool-throated flowers that avoid the day's Too fervid kisses; every bud that drinks The tipsy dew and to the starlight plays Nocturnes of fragrance, thy wing'd shadow links In bonds of secret brotherhood and faith; O bearer of their order's shibboleth, Like some pale symbol fluttering o'er these pinks. What dost thou whisper in the balsam's ear That sets it blushing, or the hollyhock's,â A syllabled silence that no man may hear,â As dreamily upon its stem it rocks? What spell dost bear from listening plant to plant, Like some white witch, some ghostly ministrant, Some spectre of some perished flower of phlox? O voyager of that universe which lies Between the four walls of this garden fair,â Whose constellations are the fireflies That wheel their instant courses everywhere,â 'Mid fairy firmaments wherein one sees Mimic BoÃ¶tes and the Pleiades, Thou steerest like some fairy ship-of-air. Gnome-wrought of moonbeam-fluff and gossamer, Silent as scent, perhaps thou chariotest Mab or King Oberon; or, haply, her His queen, Titania, on some midnight quest.â Oh for the herb, the magic euphrasy, That should unmask thee to mine eyes, ah me! And all that world at which my soul hath guessed! THE GRASSHOPPER I What joy you take in making hotness hotter, In emphasizing dullness with your buzz, Making monotony more monotonous! When summer comes, and drouth hath dried the water In all the creeks, we hear your ragged rasp Filing the stillness. Or,âas urchins beat A stagnant pond whereon the bubbles gasp,â Your switch-like music whips the midday heat. O burr of sound caught in the Summer's hair, We hear you everywhere. II We hear you in the vines and berry-brambles, Along the unkempt lanes, among the weeds, Amid the shadeless meadows, gray with seeds, And by the wood, round which the rail-fence rambles, Sawing the sunlight with your sultry saw. Or,âlike to tomboy truants, at their play With noisy mirth among the barn's deep straw,â You sing away the careless summer-day. O brier-like voice that clings in idleness To Summer's drowsy dress. III You tramp of insects, vagrant and unheeding, Improvident, who of the summer make One long green meal-time, and for winter take No care, aye singing or just merely feeding! Happy-go-lucky vagabond,âthough frost Shall pierce, ere long, your coat of green or brown, And pinch your body,âlet no song be lost, But as you lived, into your grave go downâ Like some small poet with his little rhyme, Forgotten of all time. FOREST AND FIELD I Green, watery jets of light let through The rippling foliage drenched with dew; And golden glimmers, warm and dim, That in the vistaed distance swim; Where, round the wood-spring's oozy urn, The limp, loose fronds of forest fern Trail like the tresses, green and wet, A wood-nymph binds with violet. O'er rocks that bulge and roots that knot The emerald-amber mosses clot; From matted walls of brier and brush The elder nods its plumes of plush; And, Argus-eyed with bloom on bloom, The wild-rose breathes its wild perfume; May-apples, ripening yellow, lean With oblong fruit, a lemon-green, Near Indian-turnips, long of stem, That bear an acorn-oval gem, As if some woodland Bacchus there,â While braiding locks of hyacinth hair With ivy-tod,âhad idly tossed His thyrsus down and so had lost: And blood-root, that from scarlet wombs Puts forth, in spring, its milk-white blooms, That then like starry footsteps shine Of April under beech and pine; At which the gnarlÃ©d eyes of trees Stare, big as Fauns', at DryadÃ«s, That bend above a fountain's spar, As white and naked as a star. The stagnant stream flows sleepily Thick-paved with lily-pads; the bee,â Brown, honey-drunk, a Bassarid,â Booms past the mottled toad, that, hid In calamus and blue-eyed grass, Beside the water's pooling glass, Silenus-like, eyes stolidly The MÃ¦nad-glittering dragonfly. And pennyroyal and peppermint Pour dry-hot odors without stint From fields and banks of many streams; And in their scent one almost seems To see Demeter pass, her breath Sweet with her triumph over death.â A haze of floating saffron; sound Of shy, crisp creepings o'er the ground; The dip and stir of twig and leaf; Tempestuous gusts of spices brief Borne over bosks of sassafras By winds that foot it on the grass; Sharp, sudden songs and whisperings, That hint at untold, hidden thingsâ Pan and Sylvanus who of old Kept sacred each wild wood and wold. A wily light beneath the trees Quivers and dusks with every breezeâ A Hamadryad, haply, who,â Culling her morning meal of dew From frail, accustomed cups of flowers,â Now sees some Satyr in the bowers, Or hears his goat-hoof snapping press A brittle branch, and in distress Shrinks back; her dark, dishevelled hair Veiling her limbs one instant there. II Down precipices of the dawn The rivers of the day are drawn, The soundless torrents, free and far, Of gold that deluge every star. There is a sound of winds and wings That fills the woods with carollings; And, dashed on moss and flower and fern, And leaves, that quiver, breathe and burn, Rose-radiance smites the solitudes, The dew-drenched hills, the dripping woods That twitter as with canticles Of bird and brook; and air that smells Of flowers, and buds, and boisterous bees, Delirious honey and wet trees.â Through briers that trip them, one by one, With swinging pails, that flash the sun, A troop of girls comesâberriers, Whose bare feet glitter where they pass Through dewdrop-trembling tufts of grass. And, oh! their laughter and their cheers Wake Echo on her shrubby rocks Who, answering, from her mountain mocks With rapid fairy hornsâas if Each mossy vale and weedy cliff Had its imperial Oberon, Who, seeking his Titania, hid In coverts caverned from the sun, In kingly wrath had called and chid. Cloud-feathers, oozing orange light, Make rich the Indian locks of Night; Her dusky waist with sultry gold Girdled and buckled fold on fold. One star. A sound of bleating flocks. Great shadows stretched along the rocks, Like giant curses overthrown By some Arthurian champion. Soft-swimming sorceries of mist That streak blue glens with amethyst. And, tinkling in the clover dells, The twilight sound of cattle-bells. And where the marsh in reed and grass Burns, angry as a shattered glass, The flies blur sudden gold, and shine Like drops of amber-scattered wine Spun high by reeling Bacchanals, When Bacchus wreathes his curling hair With vine-leaves, and from every lair His worshippers around him calls. They come, they come, a happy throng, The berriers with lilt and song; Their pails brimmed black to tin-bright eaves With luscious fruit, kept cool with leaves Of aromatic sassafras; 'Twixt which a berry often slips, Like laughter, from the purple mass, Wine-swollen as Silenus' lips. III The tanned and tired Noon climbs high Up burning reaches of the sky; Below the drowsy belts of pines The rock-ledged river leaps and shines; And over rainless hill and dell Is blown the harvest's sultry smell: While, in the fields, one sees and hears The brawny-throated harvesters,â Their red brows beaded with the heat,â By twos and threes among the wheat Flash their hot scythes; behind them press The bindersâmen and maids who sing Like some mad troop of piping Pan;â While all the hillsides, echoing, ring Such sounds of Ariel airiness As haunted freckled Caliban. âO ho! O ho! 't is noon I say. The roses blow. Away, away, above the hay, To the song o' the bees the roses sway; The love-lays that they hum all day, So low! so low! The roses' Minnesingers they.â Up velvet lawns of lilac skies The tawny moon begins to rise Behind low, blue-black hills of trees,â As rises up, in siren seas, To rock in purple deeps, hip-hid, A virgin-bosomed Oceanid.â Gaunt shadows crouch by tree and scaur, Dusk's shaggy Satyrs waiting for The Nymphs of moon, the Dryads white, Who take with loveliness the night, And glorify it with their love. The sweet, far notes I hear, I hear, Beyond dim pines and mellow ways; The song of some fair harvester, The lovely Limnad of the grove, Whose singing charms me while it slays. âO deep! O deep! the earth and air Are sunk in sleep. Adieu to care! Now everywhere Is rest; and by the old oak there The maiden with the nut-brown hair Doth keep, doth keep Tryst with her lover the young and fair.â IV Like Atalanta's spheres of gold, Within the orchard, apples rolled From sudden hands of boughs that lay Their leaves, like palms, against the day; And near them pears of rusty brown Rolled bruised; and peaches, pink with down, And furry as the ears of Pan; Or, like Diana's cheeks, a tan Beneath which burnt a tender fire; Or wan as Psyche's with desire. And down the orchard vistas,âyoung, A hickory basket by him swung, A hat of straw against the sun Drawn shadowy o'er his face,âhe strode; As if he looked to find some one, His eyes searched every bend of road. Before him, like a living burr, Rattled the noisy grasshopper. And where the cows' melodious bells Trailed music up and down the dells, Beside the spring, that o'er the ground Went whimpering like a fretful hound, He saw her waiting, fair and slim, Her pail forgotten there, for him. Yellow as sunset skies and pale As fairy clouds that stay or sail Through azure vaults of summer, blue As summer heavens, the wildflowers grew; And blossoms on which spurts of light Fell laughingâlike the lips one might Feign once were Hebe's, or a girl's That laughter lights with rows of pearls. Long ferns, in murmuring masses heaped; And mosses moist, in beryl steeped And musk aromas of the wood And silence of the solitude: And everything that near her blew The spring had showered thick with dew.â Across the rambling fence she leaned, Her fresh, round arms all white and bare; Her artless beauty, bonnet-screened, Simplicity from feet to hair. A wood-thrush gurgled in a vineâ Ah! 't is his step, 't is he she hears; The wild-rose smelt like some rare wineâ He comes, ah, yes! 't is he who nears. And her brown eyes and happy face Said welcome. And with rustic grace He leant beside her; and they had Some talk with youthful laughter glad: I know not what: I know but thisâ Its final period was a kiss. SUMMER I Hang out your loveliest star, O Night! O Night! Your richest rose, O Dawn! To greet sweet Summer, her, who, clothed in light, Leads Earth's best hours on. Hark! how the wild birds of the woods Throat it within the dewy solitudes! The brook sings low and soft, The trees make song, As, from her heaven aloft, Comes blue-eyed Summer like a girl along. II And as the Day, her lover, leads her in, How bright his beauty glows! How red his lips, that ever try to win Her mouth's delicious rose! And from the beating of his heart Warm winds arise and sighing thence depart: And from his eyes and hair The light and dew Fall round her everywhere, And heaven above her is an arch of blue. III Come to the forest, or the treeless meadows Deep with their hay or grain; Come where the hills lift high their thrones of shadows, And tawny orchards reign. Come where the reapers whet the scythe; Where golden sheaves are heaped; where berriers blithe, With willow-basket and with pail, Swarm knoll and plain; Where flowers freckle every vale, And Beauty goes with hands of berry-stain. IV Come where the dragonflies, a brassy blue, Flit round the wildwood streams, And, sucking at some horn of honey-dew, The wild-bee hums and dreams. Come where the butterfly waves wings of sleep, Gold-disked and mottled, over blossoms deep: Come where beneath the rustic bridge The creek-frog cries; Or in the shade the rainbowed midge, Above the emerald pools, with murmurings flies. V Come where the cattle browse within the brake, As red as oak and strong; Where cattle-bells the echoes faintly wake, And milkmaids sing their song. Come where the vine-trailed rocks, with waters hoary, Tell to the sun some legend old or story; Or where the sunset to the land Speaks words of gold; Where Ripeness walks, a wheaten band About her brow, making the buds unfold. VI Come where the woods lift up their stalwart arms Unto the star-sown skies; Knotted and gnarled, that to the winds and storms Fling mighty rhapsodies: Or to the moon repeat what they have seen, When Night upon their shoulders vast doth lean. Come where the dew's clear syllable Slips from the rose; And where the fireflies fill The dark with golden music of their glows. VII Now while the dingles and the vine-roofed glens Whisper their flowery tale Unto the silence; and the lakes and fens Unto the moonlight pale Murmur their rapture, let us seek her out, Her of the honey throat and peach-sweet pout, Summer! and at her feet, The love of old Lay like a sheaf of wheat, And of our hearts the purest gold of gold. INDIAN SUMMER The dawn is a warp of fever, The eve is a woof of fire; And the month is a singing weaver Weaving a red desire. With stars Dawn dices with Even For the rosy gold they heap On the blue of the day's broad heaven, On the black of the night's wide deep. It 'sââReins to the blood!â and âMarry!â The Season 's a prince who burns With the teasing lusts that harry His heart for a wench who spurns. It 'sââCrown us a beaker with sherry, To drink to the doxy's heels; A tankard of wine o' the berry, To lips like a cloven peel's. â'S death! if a king be saddened, Right so let a fool laugh lies: But wine! when a king is gladdened, And a woman's waist and her eyes.â He hath shattered the loom of the weaver, And left but a leaf that flits, He hath seized heaven's gold, and a fever Of mist and of frost is its. He hath tippled the buxom beauty, And gotten her hug and her kissâ The wide world 's royal booty To pile at her feet for this. TO SORROW I O dark-eyed spirit of the marble brow, Whose look is silence and whose touch is night, Who walkest lonely through the world, O thou, Who sittest lonely with Life's blown-out light; Who in the hollow hours of night's noon Criest like some lost child; Whose anguish-fevered eyeballs seek the moon To cool their pulses wild. Thou who dost bend to kiss Joy's sister cheek, Turning its rose to alabaster; yea, Thou who art terrible and mad and meek, Why in my heart art thou enshrined to-day? Sorrow, O say! O say! II Now Spring is here and all the world is white, I will go forth, and where the forest robes Itself in green, and every hill and height Crowns its fair head with blossoms,âspirit globes Of hyacinth and crocus dashed with dew,â I will forget my grief, And thee, O Sorrow, gazing at the blue, Beneath a last year's leaf, Of some brief violet the south-wind woos, Or bluet, whence the west-wind raked the snow; The baby eyes of love, the darling hues Of happiness, that thou canst never know, Mother of pain and woe. III On some hoar upland, hoar with clustered thorns, Hard by a river's windy white of waves, I shall sit down with Spring,âwhose eyes are morns Of light; whose cheeks the rose of health enslaves,â And so forget thee, braiding in Spring's hair The snowdrop, tipped with green, The cool-eyed primrose and the trillium fair, And moony celandine. Contented so to lie within her arms, Forgetting all the sere and sad and wan, Remembering Love alone, who, o'er earth's storms, High on the mountains of perpetual dawn, Leads the glad Hours on. IV Or in the peace that follows storm, when Even, Within the west, stands dreaming, lone and far, Clad on with green and silver, and the Heaven Is brightly brooched with one gold-glittering star, I will lie down beside a mountain lake, Round which the tall pines sigh, And, breathing musk of rain from boughs that shake Storm balsam, blowing by, Make friends of Dream and Contemplation high, And Music, listening to the mocking-bird,â Who through the hush sends its melodious cyr,â And so forget a while that other word, That all loved things must die. NIGHT Out of the East, as from an unknown shore, Thou comest with thy children in thine arms,â Slumber and Dream,âwhom mortals so adore,â Their flowing raiment sculptured to their charms: Soft on thy breast thy lovely children rest, Laid like two roses in one balmy nest. Silent thou comest, swiftly too and slow. There is no other presence like to thine, When thou approachest with thy babes divine, Thy shadowy face above them bending low, Blowing the ringlets from their brows of snow. Oft have I taken Sleep from thy dark arms, And fondled her fair head, with poppies wreathed, Within my bosom's depths, until its storms With her were hushed and I but faintly breathed: And then her sister, Dream, with frolic art Arose from rest, and in my sleeping heart Blew bubbles of dreams where elfin worlds were lost; Worlds where my stranger soul looked down at me, Or walked with spirits by a rainbowed sea, Or smiled, an unfamiliar shape of frost, Floating on gales of breathless melody. Day comes to us in garish glory garbed; But thou, thou bringest to the tired heart Rest and sweet silence, wherein are absorbed All the vain tumults of the mind and mart. Whether thou comest with hands full of stars, Or clothed in storm and cloud, the lightning bars, Rolling the thunder like a mighty dress, God moves with thee; we seem to hear His feet, Wind-like, along the floors of Heaven beat; To see His face, revealed in awfulness, Through thee, O Night, to ban us or to bless. THE HAUNTED HOUSE I The shadows sit and stand about its door Like uninvited guests and poor; And all the long, hot summer day The ceaseless locust dins its roundelay In one old sycamore. The squirrel leaves upon its rotting roof Its wandering tracks In empty hulls; and in its clapboard cracks The spider weaves a windy woof, And cells of clay the mud-wasp packs. The she-fox whelps upon its floor; And o'er its sun warped door The owlet roosts; and where the mosses run, The freckled snake basks in the sun. II The children of what fathers sleep Beneath those melancholy pines? The slow slugs slime their headstones there where creep The doddered poison-vines. The orchard, near the meadow deep, Lifts up decrepit arms, Black-lichened in a withering heap. No sap swells up to make it leap And shout against spring's storms; No blossom lulls its age asleep; The winds bring sad alarms. Big, bell-round pears and pippins, russet-red, No maiden gathers now; The worm-bored trunks weep tears of gum instead, Oozing from each old bough. III The woodlands around it are solitary And fold it like gaunt hands; The sunlight is sad and the moonlight is dreary, The hum of the country is lonesome and weary, And the bees go by in bands To gladder and lovelier lands. The grasses are rotting in walk and in bower; The loneliness,âdank and rank As a chamber where lies for a lonely hour An old-man's corpse with many a flower,â Is hushed and blank. And even the birds have passed it by, Gone with their songs to a happier sky, A happier sky and bank. IV In its desolate halls are lying, Gold, blood-red, and browned, Drifted leaves of autumn dying; And the winds, above them sighing, Turn them round and round, Make a ghostly sound As of footsteps falling, flying, Ghostly footsteps, faintly flying Through the haunted house. V Gazing down in her white shroud, Wov'n of windy cloud, Comes at night the phantom moon; Comes, and all the shadows soon, Crowding chambers of the house, Haunting whispering rooms, arouse;â Shadows, ghosts, her rays lead on, Till beneath the cloud Like a ghost she 's gone, In her gusty shroud, O'er the haunted house. AUTUMN I oft have met her slowly wandering Beside a leafy stream, her locks blown wild, Her cheeks a hectic flush, more fair than Spring, As if on her the scarlet copse had smiled. Or I have seen her sitting, dark and tall,â Her gentle eyes with foolish weeping dim,â Beneath a twisted oak from whose red leaves She wound great drowsy wreaths and let them fall; The west-wind in her hair, that made it swim Far out behind, brown as the rustling sheaves. Or in the hill-lands I have often seen The marvel of her passage; glimpses faint Of glimmering woods that glanced the hills between, Like Indian faces, fierce with forest paint. Or I have met her 'twixt two beechen hills, Within a dingled valley near a fall, Held in her nut-brown hand one cardinal flower; Or wading dimly where the leaf-dammed rills Went babbling through the wildwood's arrased hall, Where burned the beech and maples glared their power. Or I have met her by a ruined mill, Where trailed the crimson creeper, serpentine, On fallen leaves that stirred and rustled, chill, And watched her swinging in the wildgrapevine. While Beauty, sad among the vales and mountains, More sad than death, or all that death can teach, Dreamed of decay and stretched appealing arms, Where splashed the murmur of the forest's fountains: With all her loveliness did she beseech, And all the sorrow of her wildwood charms. Once only in a hollow, girt with trees, A-dream amid wild asters filled with rain, I glimpsed her cheeks, red-berried by the breeze, In her dark eyes the night's sidereal stain. And once upon an orchard's tangled path, Where all the goldenrod had turned to brown, Where russets rolled and leaves lay sweet of breath, I did behold her 'mid her aftermath Of blossoms standing, in her gypsy gown, Within her gaze the dreams of life and death. ALONG THE OHIO Athwart a sky of brass long welts of gold; A river of flame the wide Ohio lies; Beneath the sunset, billowing manifold, The dark-blue hill-tops rise. And, westering, dips the crescent of the moon Through great cloud-feathers, flushed with rosy ray, That close around the crystal of her lune The redbird wings of Day. A little skiff slips o'er the burnished stream; A wake of flame, that broadens far behind, Follows in ripples; and the paddles gleam Against the evening wind. Was it the boat, the solitude, and hush, That with dead Indians peopled all the glooms? That made each bank, meseemed, and every bush, Start into eagle-plumes? That made me seem to hear the breaking brush, And, as the stag's great antlers swelled in view, To hear the arrow twang from cane and rush, That dipped to the canoe? To see the glimmering wigwams by the waves? And, wildly clad, around the camp-fires' glow, The Shawnee chieftains with their painted braves, Each with his battle-bow? . . . But now the vision like the sunset fades, The clouds of ribbÃ©d gold have oozed their light; And from the west, like sombre sachem shades, Gallop the shades of night. The broad Ohio glitters to the stars; And many murmurs wander through its woodsâ Is it the mourning of dead warriors For their lost solitudes? The moon is set; but, like another moon, The crescent of the river shimmers there, Unchanged as when the eyes of Daniel Boone Beheld it flowing fair. THE OLD INN Red-winding from the sleepy town, One takes the lone, forgotten lane Straight through the hills. A brush-bird brown Bubbles in thorn-flowers sweet with rain, Where breezes bend the gleaming grain And cautious drip of higher leaves The lower dips that drip again, Above the tangled trees it heaves Its gables and its haunted eaves. One creeper, gnarled and blossomless, O'erforests all its eastern wall; The sighing cedars rake and press Dark boughs along the panes they sprawl; While, where the sun beats, drone and drawl The mud-wasps; and one bushy bee, Gold-dusty, hurls along the hall To crowd into a crack.âTo me The shadows seem too scared to flee. Of ragged chimneys martins make Huge pipes of music; twittering, here They build and brood.âMy footfalls wake Strange stealing echoes, till I fear I 'll see my pale self drawing near, My phantom self as in a glass; Or one, men murdered, buriedâwhere?â Dim in gray, stealthy glimmer, pass With lips that seem to moan âAlas!â THE MILL-WATER The water-flag and wild cane grow Round banks whereon the sunbeams sow Ephemeral gold when, on its shores, The wind sighs through the sycamores. In one green angle, just in reach, Between a willow-tree and beech, Moss-grown and leaky lies a boat The thick-grown lilies keep afloat. And through its waters, half-awake, Slow swims the spotted water-snake; And near its edge, like some gray streak, Stands gaunt the still fly-up-the-creek. Between the lily-pads and blooms The water-spirits set their looms, And weave the lace-like light that dims The glimmering leaves of under limbs. Each lily is the hiding-place Of some dim wood-thing's elvish face, That watches you with gold-green eyes Where bubbles of its breathing rise. I fancy, when the waxing moon Leans through the trees and dreams of June; And when the black bat slants its wing, And lonelier the green-frogs sing; I fancy, when the whippoorwill In some old tree sings wildly shrill, With glow-worm eyes that dot the dark,â Each holding high a firefly spark, To torch its way,âthe wood-imps come: And some float rocking here; and some Unmoor the lily-leaves and oar Around the old boat by the shore. They climb through oozy weeds and moss; They swarm its rotting sides and toss Their firefly torches o'er its edge Or hang them in the tangled sedge. The boat is loosed. The moon is pale. Around the dam they slowly sail. Upon its bow, to pilot it, A jack-o'-lantern flame doth sit. Yes; I have seen it all in dreams: Naught is forgottenânaught, it seemsâ The strangled face, the matted hair, Drown'd, of the woman trailing there. THE DREAM Thus did I dream: It seemed the afternoon Of some deep, tropic day; and yet the moon Hung, round and bright with golden alchemy, High in a heaven sapphire as the sea. Long, lawny lengths of perishable cloud Templed the west, o'er rolling forests bowed; Clouds raining colors, gold and violet, That, opening, seemed from inner worlds to let Down hints of Parian beauty and lost charms Of old romance, peopled with fairy forms. And all about me fruited orchards grew, Pear, quince, and peach, and plums of dusty blue; Rose-apricots, and apples streaked with fire, Kissed into ripeness by some sun's desire, And big with juice. And on far, fading hills, Down which it seemed a hundred torrent rills Flashed silent silver, vines and vines and vines Terraced the world with vintage, cooling wines, Pleasant and fragrant as the heart of June, Their delicate tang drawn from the wine-white moon. And from the clouds o'er this sweet world there dripped An odorous music, strange and feverish-lipped, That swung and swooned and panted as with sighs; Investing at each throb the air with eyes And forms of sensuous spirits, limpid white, Clad on with raiment as of starry night; Fair, frail embodiments of melody, From out whose hearts of crystal one could see The music stream like light through delicate hands Hollowing a lamp. And as on sounding sands The ocean murmur haunts the rosy shells,â Within whose convolutions beauty dwells,â My soul became a harp of vibrant love ReÃ«choing all the harmony above. SPRING TWILIGHT The sun set late; and left along the west A furious ruby; o'er which billowy snows Of clouds unrolled; each cloud a mighty breast Blooming with almond-rose. The sun set late; and wafts of wind beat down, And cuffed the blossoms from the blossoming quince; Scattered the petals of the poppy's crown, And made the clover wince. By dusking forests, through whose fretful boughs In flying fragments shot the evening's flame, Adown the tangled lane the quiet cows With dreamy tinklings came. The sun set late; but scarcely had he gone When o'er the moon's gold-litten crescent there, Bright Phosphor, polished as a precious stone, Burned in fair deeps of air. As from faint stars the glory waned and waned, The crickets made the old-time garden shrill; Beyond the luminous pasture-lands complained The first far whippoorwill. A SLEET-STORM IN MAY On southern winds shot through with amber light, Breathing soft balm and clothed in cloudy white, The lily-fingered Spring came o'er the hills, Waking the crocus and the daffodils. O'er the cold Earth she breathed a tender sighâ The maples sang and flung their banners high, Their crimson tasselled pennons, and the elm Bound his dark brows with a green-crested helm. Beneath the musky rot of last year's leaves, Under the forest's myriad naked eaves, Life woke and rose in gold and green and blue, Robed in the starlight of the twinkling dew. With timid tread adown the barren wood Spring held her way, when, lo! before her stood White-mantled Winter nodding his white head, Stormy his brow and stormily he said: âThe God of Terror, and the King of Storm, Must I remind thee how my iron arm Raised rebel standards 'mid these conquered bowers, Turning their green to crimson?âThou, with flowers, Thou wouldst supplant me! nay! usurp my throne!â Audacious one!ââ And at her breast he tossed A glittering spear of ice and piercing frost, And struck her down, dead on th' unfeeling mold. The fragile blossoms, gathered in the fold Of her young bosom, fell in desolate rows About her beauty; and, like fragrant snows, Covered her lovely hands and beautiful feet, Or on her lips lay like last kisses sweet That died there. Lilacs, musky of the May, And bluer violets and snowdrops lay Entombed in crystal, icy faint and fair, Like teardrops scattered through her heavenly hair. Alas! sad heart, break not beneath the pain! Time changeth all; the Beautiful wakes again.â We should not question such; a higher power Knows best what bud is ripest, or what flower, Silently plucks it at the fittest hour. THE HEART O' SPRING Whiten, oh, whiten, O clouds of lawn! Lily-like clouds that whiten above, Now like a dove, and now like a swan, But never, oh, neverâpass on! pass on!â Never as white as the throat of my love. Blue-black night on the mountain peaksâ Oh, not so black as the locks o' my love! Stars that shine through the evening's streaks Over the torrent that flashes and breaks, Brighter the eyes of my love, my love! Moon in a cloud, as white as snow, Mist in the vale where the rivulet bounds, Dropping from ledge to ledge below, Turning to gold in the sunset's glow, Softer and sweeter her footstep sounds. Sound o' May winds in the blossoming trees, Oh, not so sweet as her laugh that rings; Song o' wild birds on the morning breeze, Birds and brooks and murmur o' bees, Sweeter her voice when she laughs or sings. The rose o' my heart is she; my dawn! My star o' the east, my moon above! My soul takes ship for the Avalon Of her heart of hearts, and shall sail on Till it anchors safe in its haven of love. âA BROKEN RAINBOW ON THE SKIES OF MAYâ A broken rainbow on the skies of May, Touching the dripping roses and low clouds, And in wet clouds like scattered jewels lost:â So in the sorrow of her soul the ghost Of one great love, of iridescent ray, Spanning the roses gray of memory, Against the tumult of life's rushing crowdsâ A broken rainbow on the skies of May. A flashing humming-bird among the flowers, Deep-colored blooms; its slender tongue and bill Sucking the calyxed and the honeyed myrrhs, Till, sick of sweets, to other flow'rs it whirrs:â Such was his love that won her heart's full bowers To yield to him their all, their sweets in showers, The flower from which he drank his body's fillâ A flashing humming-bird among the flowers. A moon, moth-white, that through far mists, like fleece, Moves amber-girt into a bulk of black, And, lost to sight, rims all the black with froth:â A love that swept its moon, like some great moth, Across the heaven of her soul's young peace; And, smoothly passing, in the clouds did cease Of time, through which its burning light comes backâ A moon, moth-white, that moves through mists like fleece. A bolt of living thunder downward hurled, Momental blazing from the piled-up storm, That etches out the mountains and the ocean, The towering rocks, then blots the sight's commotion:â Love, love that swiftly coming bared the world, The deeps of life, round which fate's clouds are curled, And, ceasing, left all night and black alarmâ A bolt of living thunder downward hurled. ORGIE On nights like this, when bayou and lagoon Swoon in the moonlight's mystic radiance, I seem to walk like one deep in a trance With old-world myths born of the mist and moon. Lascivious eyes and mouths of sensual rose Smile into mine: and breasts of luring light, And tresses streaming golden to the night, Persuade me onward where the forest glows. And then it seems along the haunted hills There falls a flutter as of beautiful feet, As if tempestuous troops of MÃ¦nads meet To drain deep bowls and shout and have their wills. And then I feel her limbs will be revealed Like some great snow-white moth among the trees; Her vampire beauty, waiting there to seize And drag me downward where my doom is sealed. THE FARMSTEAD Yes, I love the Farmstead. There In the spring the lilacs blew Plenteous perfume everywhere; There in summer gladioles drew Parallels of scarlet glare. And the moon-hued primrose cool, Satin-soft and redolent; Honeysuckles beautiful, Filling all the air with scent; Roses red or white as wool. Roses, glorious and lush, Rich in tender-tinted dyes, Like the gay tempestuous rush Of unnumbered butterflies, Clustering o'er each bending bush. Here japonica and box, And the wayward violets; Clumps of star-enameled phlox, And the myriad flowery jets Of the twilight four-o'-clocks. Ah, the beauty of the place! When the June made one great rose, Full of musk and mellow grace, In the garden's humming close, Of her comely mother face! Bubble-like the hollyhocks Budded, burst, and flaunted wide Gypsy beauty from their stocks; Morning-glories, bubble-dyed, Swung in honey-hearted flocks. Tawny tiger-lilies flung Doublets slashed with crimson on; Graceful slave-girls, fair and young, Like Circassians, in the sun Alabaster lilies swung. Ah, the droning of the bee; In his dusty pantaloons Tumbling in the fleurs-de-lis; In the drowsy afternoons Dreaming in the pink sweet-pea. Ah, the moaning wildwood dove! With its throat of amethyst Rippled like a shining cove Which a wind to pearl hath kissed, Moaning, moaning of its love. And the insects' gossip thinâ From the summer hotness hidâ In lone, leafy deeps of green; Then at eve the katydid With its hard, unvaried din. Often from the whispering hills, Borne from out the golden dusk,â Gold with gold of daffodils,â Thrilled into the garden's musk The wild wail of whippoorwills. From the purple-tangled trees, Like the white, full heart of night, Solemn with majestic peace, Swam the big moon, veined with light, Like some gorgeous golden-fleece. She was there with me.âAnd who, In the magic of the hour, Had not sworn that they could view, Beading on each blade and flower Moony blisters of the dew? And each fairy of our home,â Firefly,âits taper lit In the honey-scented gloam, Dashing down the dusk with it Like an instant-flaming foam. And we heard the calling, calling, Of the brown owl in the brake; Where the trumpet-vine hung, crawling Down the ledge, into the lake Heard the sighing streamlet falling. Then we wandered to the creek Where the water-lilies, growing Thick as stars, lay white and weak; Or against the brooklet's flowing Stooped and bathed a bashful cheek. And the moonlight, rippling golden, Fell in virgin aureoles On their bosoms, half-unfolden, Where, it seemed, the fairies' souls Dreamed as perfume,âunbeholden;â Lying sleeping, pearly-tented, Baby-cribbed within each bud, While the night-wind, pinewood-scented, Swooning over field and flood, Rocked them on the waters dented. Then the low, melodious bell Of a sleeping heifer tinkled, In some berry-briered dell, As her satin dewlap wrinkled With the cud that made it swell. And, returning home, we heard, In a beech-tree at the gate, Some brown, dream-behaunted bird, Singing of its absent mate, Of the mate that never heard. And, you see, now I am gray, Why within the old, old place, With such memories, I stay: Fancy out her absent face Long since passed away. She was mineâyes! still is mine: And my frosty memory Reels about her, as with wine Warmed into young eyes that see All the past that was divine. Yes, I loved her, and have grown Melancholy in that love, And the memory alone Of her loveliness whereof She did sanctify each stone. And where'er her flowers swing, There she walks,âas if a bee Fanned them with its airy wing,- Down her garden, shadowy In the hush the evenings bring. THE BOY COLUMBUS And he had mused on lands each bird,â That winged from realms of Falerina, O'er seas of the Enchanted Sword,â In romance sang him, till he heard Far foam on Islands of Alcina. For rich Levant and old Castile Let other seamen freight their galleys; With Polo he and Mandeville Through stranger seas a dreamy keel Sailed into wonder-peopled valleys. Far continents of flow'r and fruit, Of everlasting spring; where fountains 'Mid flow'rs, with human faces, shoot; Where races dwell, both man and brute, In cities under golden mountains. Where cataracts their thunders hurl From heights the tempest has at mercy; Vast peaks that touch the moon, and whirl Wild torrents down of gold and pearl; And forests strange as those of Circe. Let rapiered Love lute, in the shade Of royal gardens, to the Palace And Court, that haunt the balustrade Of terraces and still parade Their vanity and guile and malice. Him something calls, diviner yet Than Love, more mighty than a lover; Heroic Truth, that will not let Deed lag; a purpose, westward set, In eyes far-seeing to discover. NORTH BEACH, FLORIDA Surge upon surge, the miles of surf uncurl Volutes of murmur; and the far shore foams; The thundering billows, boiling into pearl, The sea-wind clouds and combs. Wave upon wave,âas when the Nereids pour, With streaming tresses, landward, when the arms Of Tritons reach them, racing towards the shore,â Bursts on the beach that storms. Oh, thou primeval solitude! that rolled Out of creation when the world was young! That shall roll on when man is not, and old The ages yet unsung! Time shall not flaw thy music!âthou hast heard God's spirit on thy waters, and no night Annuls the memory of that one Word Which blossomed into light. With such impression as upon thy face The soaring seagulls make, man comes and came; And countless myriads, race on warring race, Have found thee thusâthe same. Thy part isâto destroy, and still remain Immutable 'midst mutability: The symbol of all change, that clothes again Mystery in mystery. THE STORM Thor, Thor is out on the hills! The frown of his fierce brow showing; His breath through his red beard blowing, With rain, through his beard that it fills. The forests are taken; The mightiest oaks Are twisted and shaken As by chariot-spokes, Where mountains awaken To th' hoofs of his yokes, Reined sheer with the strength of his armâ Ride forth, O Spirit of Storm! What hope for the sparrow, Or nest of the bird! Where fords were once narrow, What hope for the herd! When arrow on arrow He empties the third Of his quiver against their alarmâ Descend, O Spirit of Storm! You may measure the might that he brings By the welkin that echoes his felloes; By the fork of the lightning,âthat yellows The darkness,âthe hammer he swings. The cattle are scattered And low from the shore; The roses are shattered That grew at the door; The swallows look tattered, And twitter and soar, Made glad with the force of his formâ Rejoice, O Spirit of Storm! On levels that sunder The roar of the main He ploughs with the thunder, And sows with the rain: No sunbeam shall blunder Through black till the plain Is planted with storm as a farmâ Sweep on, O Spirit of Storm! His path is the abysm, which heaps The wild wind behind him, and hovers A whirlwind before, that uncovers The hurricane-lair where he sleeps. At night,âthrough the wrestle Of winds that contend,â To guard the good vessel From rocks that would rend, Like a star let it nestle, The light, to defend The seaman and his from all harmâ From thee, O Spirit of Storm! ON THE JELLICO SPUR OF THE CUMBERLANDS To ... You remember how the mist, When we climbed to Devil's Den, Pearl-white in the mountain glen, And above us, amethyst, Throbbed and circled? then away, Through the wildwoods opposite, Torn and scattered, morning-lit, Vanished into dewy gray?â Vague as in romance we saw, From the fog one riven trunk, Talon-like with branches shrunk, Thrust a monster dragon claw. And we climbed for hours through The dawn-dripping Jellicoes, To a wooded rock, whence those Undulating leagues of blue Summits,âmountain-chains that lie Dark with forest, bar on bar,â Ranged their wild, irregular, Purple peaks beneath a sky Ocean-azure. Range on range Billowed their enormous spines, Where the rocks and priestly pines Sat eternal, without change. We were sons of Nature then: She had taken us to her, Drawn us, bound with brier and burr, Closer her than other men: Intimates of all her moods, From her bloom-anointed looks, Wisdom of no man-made books Learned we in those solitudes: How the seed contained the flower; How the acorn held the oak; How within the vine awoke The wild impulse still to tower: How in fantasy or mirth, Springing when she summoned there, Sponge-like fungi everywhere Bulged, exuded from the earth: Coral-vegetable things, That the underworld exhaled, Bulbous, fluted, ribbed, and scaled, Many colored and in rings, Like the Indian-Pipe that grew Pink and white in loamy cracks, Flowers of a natural wax, She had turned her fancy to.â On that laureled precipice, Where the chestnuts dropped their burrs, Warm with balsam of the firs, First we felt her mother-kiss Full of heaven and the wind; While the forests, wood on wood, Murmured like a multitude Giving praise where none hath sinned.â Freedom met us there; we saw Freedom giving audience; In her face the eloquence, Lightning-like, of love and law: Round her, on majestic hips, Lounged the giant mountains, where Streaming cataracts tossed their hair, God and thunder on their lips.â Oft an eagle, or a hawk, Or a scavenger, we knew Winged above us through the blue By its shadow on the rock. Or a cloud of templed white Moved, a lazy berg of pearl, Through the sky's pacific swirl, Shot with cool, cerulean light. So we dreamed an hour upon That high rock the lichens mossed, While around us, glimmering, tossed Golden mintings of the sun: Then arose; and a ravine, Which a torrent once had worn, Made our roadway to the corn In the valley, deep and green; And the farm-house with its bees, Where old-fashioned flowers spun Gay rag-carpets in the sun, Gray among the apple-trees. Here we watched the evening fall: O'er Wolf Mountain sunset made, Huge, a rhododendron, rayed Round the sun's cloud-calyxed ball. Then through scents of herb and soil, To the mining-camp we turned, In the twinkling dusk discerned With its white-washed homes of toil. Ah, those nights!âWe wandered forth On some haunted mountain path, When the moon rose late; and rathe The large stars, sowed south and north, Splashed with gold the purple skies; And the milky zodiac, Rolled athwart the belted black, Seemed a path to Paradise. And we walked or tarried till, In the valley-land beneath, Like the vapor of a breath Breathed in frost, arose the still Architecture of the mist: And the moon-dawn's necromance Touched the mist and made it glance Terraced pearl and amethyst. Then around us, sharp and brusque, Night's shrill insects strident strung Fairy viols that buzzed and sung, Pixy music of the dusk. And we seemed to hear soft sighs, And hushed steps of ghostly things, Fluttered feet and rustled wings All around us. Fireflies, Gleaming in the tangled glade, Seemed the eyes of warriors, Stealing under watching stars To some phantom ambuscade; To the tepees there that gloomed, Wigwams of the mist, that slept By the woodland side, whence crept Shadowy Shawnees moonbeam-plumed. When the moon rose, like a cup Lay the valley, brimming shine Of mesmeric mist, like wine, To the sky's dim face held up. As she rose from out the mines Of the nacreous darkness, Night Met her, clad in dewy light 'Mid Pine Mountain's sachem pines. As through fragmentary fleece Of the clouds her circle broke, Orey-seamed, about us woke Myths of Italy and Greece. As, an orb of sparry quartz, Her serene circumference grew, Home we turned. And all night through Slept the sleep of happy hearts. THE WHIPPOORWILL I Above lone woodland ways that led To dells the stealthy twilights tread The west was hot geranium red; And still, and still, Along old lanes the locusts sow With clustered pearls the Maytimes blow, Deep in the crimson afterglow, We heard the homeward cattle low, And then, far off, like some far woe, The whippoorwill, the whippoorwill. II Beneath the idle beechen boughs We heard the slow bells of the cows Come softly, jangling towards the house; And still, and still, Beyond the light that would not die Out of the scarlet-haunted sky, Beyond the evening-star's white eye Of glittering chalcedony, Drained out of dusk the plaintive cry Of âwhippoorwill,â of âwhippoorwill.â III And in the city oft, when swims The pale moon o'er the smoke that dims Its disc, I dream of wildwood limbs, And still, and still, I seem to hear, where shadows grope 'Midst ferns and flowers that dewdrops rope,â Lost in faint deeps of heliotrope Above the clover-sweetened slope,â Retreat, despairing, past all hope, The whippoorwill, the whippoorwill. IN THE WILDWOOD I lie where silence sleeps, And twilight dreams and sighs; Where all heaven's azure peeps Blue from one wildflower's eyes; Where, in reflecting deeps, A world, inverted, lies, Of dimmer woods and skies: Divining God from things Humble as weed and bee; From songs the wild bird sings Guessing at poetry; And from each flower that swings, Each star-familiar tree, Learning philosophy. A HOLLOW OF THE HILLS I How oft the swallow darted Above its deeps of blue, Where leaves close clung or parted To let the sunlight through! Where roses, honey-hearted, Hung full of living dew! II How oft, from out the heaven, Upon me blew the balm Of soft winds, summer-driven From continents of calm! With rustlings as of riven, Sea-sounding pine and palm! III Oft from its leafy cover I watched the red-bird slip; And marked, like some rude lover, The bee, with robber lip, Bend down the snowy clover, Or make the wild-rose dip. IV Still darts the soaring swallow Above it; and the rose Still blooms within its hollow Where still the runnel flows; The brook,âthat I shall follow No more,âthat seaward goes. V There still the white moon shineth At night through rifted trees; Upon the stream that twineth Through blooms that no one sees; And on,âas I divineth,â My soul that sighs for these. BENEATH THE BEECHES I I long, oh, long to lie 'Neath beechen branches, twisted, Green 'twixt the summer sky; The woodland shadows nigh Like dryads sunbeam-wristed: The livelong day to dream Beside a wildwood stream. II I long, oh, long to hear The claustral forest breathing, Sound soothing to the ear; To see the wild-vine near Its scarlet blooms unsheathing: The livelong day to cross Slow o'er the nut-strewn moss. III I long, oh, long to see The nesting red-bird singing Glad on the wood-rose tree: To watch the breezy bee, Half in the wildflower, swinging: God's livelong day to pass Deep in cool forest grass. IV Oh, soul, so builded in With mart and booth and steeple, Brick alley-ways of sin, What hope for you to win Ways free of pelf and people! Ways of the leaf and root And soft Mygdonian flute! THE BRIDLE-PATH I Through meadows of the ironweeds, Whose purple blooms hang, slipping The morning dew in twinkling beads, The thin path twists and, winding, leads Through woodland hollows dripping; Down to a creek of rocks and reeds; On to a lilied dam that feeds A mill, whose wheel through willow-bredes Winks, the white water whipping. II It wends through meads of mint and brush Where silvery seeds drift drowsy, Or swoon along the heatful hush; And where the bobwhite, in the bush, The elder, blooming frowsy, Keeps calling clear: then through a crush Of crowded saplings, low and lush; Then by a pool of flag and rush With brier-rose petaled blowsy. III Thence, o'er the ragweed fallow-lot, Whose low rail-fence encumbers The dense-packed berries ripening hot; Where, in the heaven, one far spot Of gray, the gray hawk slumbers; Then through the greenwood where the rot Of leaves and loam smells cool; and, shot With dotting dark, the touch-me-not Swings curling horns in numbers. IV It winds round rocks that bulge and lie Deep in damp ferns and mosses,â Each like a giant on his thigh Watching some forest quarry die;â And thence it frailly crosses A bramble-bridge; whence, whirring high, A partridge startles,â'thwart the sky A jarring light,âwhere, babbling by, The brook its diamonds tosses. V And here the cohosh swings its snow, Gaunt from the forest springing; There gold the sorrel blossoms blow; Here vari-colored toadstools sow, Or swell the soil; and, swinging, The trumpet-vine hangs red and low Near boughs,âon which the beech-burrs glow,â The woodland wind sways to and fro, O'er waters wildly ringing. VI It leads us deep into the cane Through spice-bush belts, where âtinkleâ One stray bell sounds, and then again, Lost in some lone and leafy lane Where smooth the clay ruts wrinkle . . . A cloud looms up,âa grayish stain Against the blue;âand wet with rain The wind blows, denting down the grain And leaves, the first drops sprinkle. VII The dust is drilled with raindrops.âOne, Then two quick gleams, then thunder; And, scurrying with the dust, we run Into a whiff of hay and sun, Of cribs and barns; and under Low martin-builded eaves,âwhere dun The sparrows shelter,âwatch the spun Blue rain sweep down, that seems to stun The world with wind and wonder. VIII A crashing wedge of stormy light, Vibrating, blinds, and dashes A monster elm to splinters white: Then roaring rain: then, blinding bright, A bolt again that crashes. . . . The storm is over. Left and right The clouds break; and, with green delight, Fresh rain scents blow from wood and height Where each blade drips and flashes. IX A ghostly gold burns slowly through The chasm'd clouds; and blended With rainy rose and rainy blue, The heavens, pearled with many a hue, Die like a dolphin splendid. . . . High-buoyed in wrack, now one or two Slight stars peep outâthe pirate clue To night's rich hoard.âIn dusk and dew Here is our pathway ended. THE OLD FARM Dormered and verandaed, cool, Locust-girdled on the hill, Stained with weather-wear; at Yule And Midsummer every sill Thresholding the beautiful, Still I see it standing there, Brown above the woodland deep, Wrapped in lights of lavender, And slow shadows, rocked asleep By the warm wind everywhere. I remember how the spring, Liberal-lapped, bewildered its Acred orchards, murmuring, With the blossoms' budded bits, Where the wood-thrush came to sing. Barefoot Spring, at first who trod, Like a beggarmaid, adown The wet woodland, where the god, With the bright sun for a crown And the firmament for rod, Met her; clothed her; wedded her; Her Cophethua: when, lo! All the hill, one breathing blur, Burst in blossom, gleam and glow, Peach and pearl and lavender. Seckel, blackheart, palpitant, Rained their bleaching strays; and white Snowed the damson, bent aslant; Rambow-tree and romanite Seemed beneath deep drifts to pant. And it stood there, brown and gray, In the bee-boom and the bloom, In the shadow and the ray, In the passion and perfume, Grave as age among the gay. Sweet with laughter romped the clear Boyish voices round its walls; Rare wild-roses were the dear Girlish faces in its halls, Music-haunted all the year. Far before it meadows full Of green pennyroyal sank; Clover-dotted as with wool Here and there; and now a bank Of wild color: and the cool Dark blue shadows undefined Of the clouds rolled overhead; Clouds, from which the summer wind Blew with rain, and freshly shed Dew upon the flowerkind. Where, through mint and gypsy-lily, Runs the rocky brook away, Musical among the hilly Solitudes,âits flashing spray Sunbeam-dashed or shadow-stilly,â Buried in thick sassafras, Memory follows up the hill Still some cowbell's mellow brass, Where the ruined water-mill Looms, half-hid in cane and grass. Ah, the old farm! is it set On the hilltop still? 'mid musk Of the meads? where, violet, Deepens all the dreaming dusk, And the locust trees hang wet? While the sunset, far and low, On its westward windows dashes Primrose or pomegranate glow? And above, in lilac splashes, Faint, first stars the heavens sow? Sleeps it still among its roses, Yellow roses? while the choir Of the lonesome insects dozes? And the white moon, filled with fire, O'er its mossy roof reposesâ Sleeps it still among its roses? TO SUMMER I Thou sit'st among the sunny silences Of terraced hills and woodland galleries, Thou utterance of all calm melodies, Thou lutanist of Earth's most fecund lute,â Where no false note intrudes To mar the silent music,âbranch and root, Playing the fields ripe, orchards and deep woods, To song similitudes Of flower and seed and fruit. II Oft have I felt thee, in some sensuous air, Bewitch the wide wheat-acres everywhere To imitated gold of thy rich hair: The peach, by thy red lips' delicious trouble, Blown into gradual dyes Of crimson, have I seen: have watched thee doubleâ With interluded music of thine eyesâ The grapes' rotundities, Bubble by purple bubble. III Deliberate uttered into life intense, Out of thy song's melodious eloquence Beauty evolves its just preÃ«minence: The lily, from some pensive-smitten chord Drawing significance Of purity, a visible hush stands: starred With splendor, from thy passionate utterance, The rose tells its romance In blushing word on word. IV As star by star day harps in evening, The inspiration of all things that sing Is in thy hands and from their touch takes wing: All brooks, all birds,âwhom song can never sate,â Even the wind and rain, And frogs and insects, singing soon and late, Thy sympathies inspire, thy heart's refrain, Whose sounds invigorate With rest life's weary brain. V And as the night, like some mysterious rune, Its beauty makes emphatic with the moon, Thou lutest us no immaterial tune: But where dim whispers haunt the cane and corn, By thy still strain made strong, Earth's awful avatar,âin whom is born Thy own deep music,âlabors all night long With growth, assuring morn Assumes like onward song. A GRAY DAY I Long volleys of wind and of rain, And the rain on the drizzled pane, And the day ends chill and murk; But on yesterday's eve, I trow, The new-moon's thorn-thin bow Stabbed rosy through gold and through glow, Like a rich, barbaric dirk. II The throats of the snapdragons,â Cool-colored with gold like the dawns That come with spring o'er the hills,â Are filled with a sweet rain, fine, Of starry, scintillant shine, A faery vat of thin wine, That the rain for the elfins fills. III Dabbled the poppies shrink, And the coxcomb and the pink; And the candytuft's damp crown Droops, dribbled, low bowed i' the wet; And rows of the mignonette Little musk-sacks open set, Which the weight o' the dew drags down. IV Stretched taunt 'twixt the blades of grass, A gossamer-fibered glass, That the garden-spider spun, The web, where the round rain clings In the sag o' its middle, swingsâ A hammock for elfin things When the stars succeed the sun. V And, mark, where the pale gourd grows As high as the climbing rose, How the tiger-moth is pressed To that wide leaf's under side.â And I know where the red wasps hide, And the brown bees,âthat defied The first strong gusts,âdistressed. VI Yet I feel that the gray will blow Aside for an afterglow; And the wind, on a sudden, toss Drenched boughs; a pattering shower Athwart the red dusk in a glower, Big drops heard hard on each flower, The grass and the flowering moss. VII And then for a minute, may be,â A pearl, hollow-worn, of the sea,â A glimmer of moon will smile, And a star, rinsed clean, through the dusk: And a freshness of moonlit musk O'er the showery lawns blow brusque As spice from an Indian Isle. THE MOOD O' THE EARTH My heart is high as the day is clear, As the wind in the wood that blows; My heart is high with a mood that 's cheer, And glows like a sun-blown rose. My heart is high, and up and away Like a bird in the skies' deep blue; My heart goes singing through the day, As glad as a bee i' the dew. My heart, my heart is high; its beat Is wild as the scent o' the wood, The wild sweet wind, with its pulse of heat, And its musk of blossom and bud. My heart is high; and it leads my feet Where the sense of summer is full, To woods and waters where lovers meet To hills where the creeks run cool. My heart is one, is one with the heart, With the joy o' the bee that comes And sucks i' the flowers, that dip apart For his dusty body that hums. My heart is glad as the glad redstart, The flame-flecked bird, the spotted bird, Whose lilt my soul has got by heart, Fitting each note with a word. God's love! I tread the wind and air! Am one with the hoiden wind; And the stars that swim in the blue, I swear, Right soon in my hair I'll find. To live high up, a life o' the mist, With the cloud-things in white skies,â With their limbs of pearl and of amethyst,â That laugh cerulean eyes! To creep and to suck, like an elfin thing, In the aching heart of a rose; In the bluebell's ear to cling and swing, And whisper what no one knows! To live on wild-honey, as fresh, as thin As the rain that 's left in a flower! And roll forth, golden from feet to chin, In the pollen's DanaÃ«-shower! Or free, bird-hearted, bend back the throat, With a vigorous look at the blue, And launch from my soul one wild, true note, Is the thing that my heart would do! God's life! the blood o' the earth is mine! And the mood o' the earth I'll take, And brim my soul with her wonderful wine, And sing till my heart doth break! NOONING I Weak winds that make the waters wink; White clouds that sail from lands of Fable To white Utopias, vague, that brink Sky-gulfs of blue unfathomable: Their rolling shadows drifting O'er hills of forest, lifting Wild peaks of purple range, that loom and sink. II Warm knolls, whereon the Summer dreams; And droning dells, where all her brightness Lies, lulled with hymns of mountain-streams' Far-foaming falls of windy whiteness: Where, from the glooming hollow, With cawing crows that follow, The hunted hawk wings wearily and screams. III Dry-buzzing heat and drought that shrills With one harsh locust's lonesome whirring; No voice amid the answering hills Recedes in echoes far-recurring; As when, with twilight wimpled, The Morning, rosy dimpled, From dewy tops called o'er responding rills. IV Wan with sweet summer hangs the deep Hot heaven with the high sun heartedâ A great, wide bluebell bloom asleep With golden-pistiled petals parted.â So lone, one would not startle If from yon wood should dartle Some wildwood Dream, some Myth the wildwoods keep. THE LOG-BRIDGE I Last month, where the old log-bridge is laid O'er the woodland creek, in the belts o' the shade, To the right and the left, pink-packed, was made A gloaming glory of scented tangle By the bramble roses thereâthat wade, High-heaped, from the banksâwith many a braid That, wilting, powdered the ruts, and swayed, To the waters beneath, loose loops of spangle; Where the breeze that blew and the beam that rayed Were murmurous-soft with the bees a-wrangle. II This monthâ't is Augustâthe lane that leads To the bramble-bridge runs waste with weeds, That bloom bright saffron, or satin seeds Of thistle-fleece blow at you, hazy: Starry the lane with the thousand bredes Of the yellow daisy, and bud-like beads Of marigold eyes, around which speeds The butterfly, sumptuous with mottle and lazy; Whereunder the pewee picks and pleads, On the sumach's tassel that dips to the daisy. III All golden the spot in the noon's gold shine, Where the yellow-bird sits with eyes like wine And swings and whistles; where, line on line, In coils of warmth the sunbeams nestle; Where cool by the pool (where the crawfish, fine As a shadow's shadow, darts dim) to mine The wet creek-clay with their peevish whine, Come mason-hornets; and roll and wrestle With balls of clay they carry, and twine In hollow nests on the joists o' the trestle. IV Where the horsemint shoots through the grasses,âhigh On the root-thick rivage that roofs,âa dry Gray knob that bristles with pink, the sigh Of crickets is heard; and the leaves' deep bosoms Are pierced, at dusk, with a bird's quick cry, A passing bird that twitters by: And the frogs' grave antiphons rise and die; And here, to drink, come the wild opossums: And here, to-night, will you and I Linger and lean while the great moon blossoms. AMONG THE KNOBS There is a place embanked with brush Three wooded knobs beyond, Lost, in a valley, where the lush Wild eglantine blows blond. Where light the dogwoods earliest Their torches of white fires, And, bee-bewildered, east and west The red haws build their spires. The wild crab-apples' flowery sprays Blur through the pensive gloom A fragrant pink; and by lone ways The close blackberries bloom. I love the spot: a shallow brook Slips from the forest, near A cane-brake and a violet nook; Its rustling depths so clear The minnows glimmer where they glide Above its rocky bed: A boyhood-haunted brook, not wide, That has its sparkling head Among the rainy hills; and drops By five low waterfallsâ Wild music of a hundred stopsâ Between the forests' walls: Down to a water-gate, that hangs Across the stream; a dull Portcullis rude, whose wooden fangs The moss makes beautiful. The brass-bright dragonflies about Its seeding grasses swim; The streaked wasps, worrying in and out, Dart sleepily and slim. Here in the moon-gold moss, that glows Like pools of moonlight, dies The pale anemone; and blows The bluet, blue as skies. And, where in April tenderly The wild geranium made A thin, peculiar fragrance, we, Cool in pellucid shade, Found wild strawberries just a-bud; Wild berries, tart and fresh,â Pale scarlet as a wood-bird's blood,â That May's low vines would mesh. Once from that hill a farm-house 'mid Deep orchardsâcozy brown,â In lilacs and old roses hid,â With picket-fence looked down. O'er ruins now the roses guard; The plum and seckel-pear And apricot rot on the sward Their wasted ripeness there. Again when huckleberries blow Their waxen bells I 'll tread That dear accustomed way; and go Adown that orchard; led To that avoided spot, which seems The haunt of vanished springs; Lost as the hills in drowsy dreams Of visionary things. THE FALLS OF THE OHIO Here on this jutting headland, where the trees Spread a dusk carpet for the sun to cast And count his golden guineas on, we 'll rest. Behold th' Ohio Falls: see how it seethes! Though hardly heard from this high, wooded point, Yet how it still confuses tongue and ear With its subdued and low monotonous roar! Not as it did, however, when we stood And marked it from the spanning of the bridge Rushing beneath, impetuous as a herd,â A tameless herd, with manes of flying spray,â Between the pillars towering above. No more does it confound us and confuse; Its clamor here is softened to a sound, Incessant and subdued, like that which haunts The groves of spring, when, like some dim surprise, A wind, precursor of the rain, rides down From a gray cloud and sets the leafy tongues Cool-gossiping of the approaching shower. There runs the dam; and where its dark line cuts The river's sheen, already you may see The ripples glancing to the summer sun, As if a host had couched a thousand spears And tossed a thousand plumes of fleecy foam, In answer to the challenge of the Falls, Blown from his limestone battlements, and cried From his wave-builded city's roaring walls. And there, you see, the waves like champions charge; Crowding, wild form on form, their foam-hoofs beat The ragged rocks that roll them on their way: Billowing they come; knight-like, to ringing lists, With shout on shout, tossing a thousand plumes, A thousand spears in sparkling tournament; Lifting, opposing each, a silvery shield Or shining pennon, now that sinks or soars, And many a glittering sword of twinkling foam, And many a helmet, shattered in flakes of froth, That, to the trumpeting wind, hisses away: While, o'er it all, swell out the rush and roar Of onset, as of battle borne afar.â On, on they come, a beautiful, mad troop! On, on, along the sandy banks that fling Red pebble-freckled arms far out to stay Their ruinous rush, the knightly strife of waves, Warring, and winding wild their watery horns. Look, where a thousand oily eddies whirl, And turn and turn like wheels of liquid steel Below this headland! 'T is a place that none Has bottomed yet with sounding lead and line. Like some huge kraken, coiling vast its length, The Eddy sleeps; and, bending from the shores, The spotted sycamores have gazed and gazed, Watching its slumber as gray giants might A dragon in the hollow of gaunt hills, Its serpent bulk wound round some magic hoard. So long they 've watched, their ancient backs have grown Humped, gnarled, and bent, but still they gaze and gaze, Leaning above; and from the glassy waves Their images stare back their wonderment. Haply they see the guardian Genius lie At the dark bottom in an oozy cave Of coral; webbed, recumbent on his mace Of mineral; his locks of dripping green Circling a crown of ore; his fishy eyes Dull with the aqueous dullness of his realms. But when the storm 's abroad and whips the waves With stinging lashes of the myriad rain, Or scars with thunder some ancestral oak, Sire of a forest, then he wakes in wrath, And on the dark foundation of the stream Rises, a monarch, crowned with iron crown, And hurls his challenge upward at the storm, And rages through the waters; heaves and breaks Through the wild waves, whose round and murky bulks, Ribbed white with foam, wallow their monster way, Like giant herds, along yon edge of rock O'erstrewn with petrifactions of far time; Mollusk and trilobite and honeycomb Of whitest coral; and with mass on mass Of root-like reptiles; writhings turned to rock; Huge saurian bulks that, haply, sported there, Convolved; and, in a moment, when the change,â Which made and unmade continents and seas, That teemed and groaned with mammoth and plesiosaur,â Came, with upheaval of the universe, Thro' all their monster spines were struck to stone. There where uprises a wild knoll, o'erstrewn With wrecks of ancient forest, in mid-stream Once rose an island, green and beautiful With willow and beech, poplar and sycamore; A river-island where the woodman built,â Stream-guarded from the savage-haunted shore,â His rude log cabin. Here he sowed his maize; Here saw it tassel in the summer heat, And glance like ranks of feathered Indians through The glimmering vistas of the broken wood; Here reaped and sheaved its stalks, all ivory-eared, In shocks like wigwam rows, when like a maid, An Indian maid, ruddy in dogwood beads, The autumn came, soft o'er the sunset hills, That blushed for love, and underneath her feet Cast untold gold in leaves and yellow fruit. Here dwelt the pioneer and here he died, And mingled his rough dust with the raw earth And loam of what was once an island; now A bed of limestone rock and water pools,â Where, in the quarry, you may see the blast Spout heavenward the dust and dirt and stone, And flap and pound its echoes round the hills In giant strokes as of some Titan hammer;â A mound of stump-pierced soil where once an isle,â As rich and fair in forest and in field As any isle that rises to a sail In tropic seas,âarose to kiss the sun. There lies the other half of what was once Corn Island: broad the channel beats between. Lower it lies, and mantled with dwarf brakes Of willow and of cottonwood and beech, Degenerate offsprings of the mighty boles That once o'erbrowed the stream in majesty Of tall primeval beauty. In the morn, Ere yet the east assumes its faintest blush, Here you may hear the melancholy snipe Piping, or see her paddling in the pools That splash the low bed of the rocky soil. Here once the Indian stole in natural craft From wahoo-bush to bush, from tree to tree, His head plumes like a bird, below, above, Fluttering and nodding 'mid the undergrowth; In his brown hand the pliant, polished bow, And at his back his gaudy quiver filled With tufted arrows headed blue with flint. And while the deep flamingo-colored west Flamed on his ruddy cheek, and airy fire Struck rosy 'thwart the stream, he, swift as thought, Strung his quick bow and through the gray wild goose, That rose with clamor from the rushy pool, Sent a fleet arrow; crested with the quills Which yesterday, perhaps, its mate's gray wing Made beautiful; and plucked to decorate The painted shaft that should to-day speed home And redden all their white with kindred blood: It falling, gasping at his moccasined feet, Breathed out its wild life, while the lonely brave Whooped to the sunset, and yon faint blue hills Answered his exultation with a whoop. 1885. FALL FANCIES Far off a wind blew, and I heard Wild echoes of the woods replyâ The herald of some royal word, With bannered trumpet, blown on high, Meseemed, then passed me by: Who summoned marvels there to meet, In pomp, upon a cloth of gold; Where berries of the bitter-sweet, That, splitting, showed the coals they hold, Sowed garnets through the wold: Where, under tents of maples, seeds Of smooth carnelian, oval red, The spice-bush spangled: where, like beads, The dogwood's rounded rubiesâfed With fireâblazed and bled. And there I saw amid the rout Of months, in richness cavalier, A minnesingerâlips apout; A gypsy face; straight as a spear; A rose stuck in his ear: Eyes, sparkling like old German wine, All mirth and moonlight; naught to spare Of slender beard, that lent a line Unto his lip; October there, With chestnut curling hair. His blue baretta swept its plume White through the leaves; his purple hose, Puffed at the thighs, made gleam of gloom; His tawny doublet, slashed with rose, And laced with crimson bows, Outshone the wahoo's scarlet pride, The haw, in rich vermilion dressed: A dagger dangling at his side, A slim lute, banded to his breast, Whereon his hands did rest, I saw him come. . . . And, lo, to hear The lilt of his approaching lute, No wonder that the regnant Year Bent down her beauty, blushing mute, Her heart beneath his foot. LATE OCTOBER Bulged from its cup the dark brown acorn falls, And by its gnarly saucer, in the stream's Clear puddles, swells; the sweet-gum's spike-crowned balls Beside them lie; and, opening all their seams, Beneath the chestnut-tree the burry hulls Split, and, within, each nut like copper gleams. Burst silver white, nods,âan exploded husk Of snowy, woolly smoke,âthe milk-weed's puff Along the orchard's fence; where in the dusk And ashen weeds,âas some grim Satyr's rough Red, breezy cheeks burn through his beard,âthe brusque Crab-apples glow, wind-tumbled from above. And under withered leaves the crickets' clicks Seem some dim dirge sighed into memory's ears; One bird sits in the sumach, flits and picks Its sour seeds. Thro' all the wood one hears The dropping hickories. Round the hay's railed ricks, Among the fields, gather the lowing steers. Some slim, bud-bound Leimoniad hath flocked, Like birds, the flowers, herding from their homes To warmer woods and skies. Where once were rocked Unnumbered bees within unnumbered blooms, One feeble bee clings to one bloom, or, locked Within it, dreams of summer's oozing combs. Winds shake the maples, and all suddenly A storm of leafy stars around you freaks,â Some Dryad's tattered raiment. To her knee Wading, the Naiad haunts her stream that streaks Through woodland waifs. Hark! Pan for Helike Flutes in the forest, while he seeks and seeks. A NOVEMBER WALK I Morning The hoar frost crisps beneath the feet; And, sparkling in the morning's strength, The fence, along its straggling length, Gleams as if wrought of virgin sleet. On broom-sedge fields and sassafras Neglectfully the dim wind lifts The dead leaves; and around me drifts The milkweed, shaken from the grass. Reluctantly and one by one The useless leaves drift slowly down; And, seen through woodland vistas, brown The nut-tree patters in the sun. Where pools the brook beneath its fall With scales of ice its edge is bound; And on the pebbles scattered round The ooze is frozen; each a ball, It seems, of crystal fallen there. And now the wind sweeps through the wood With sighings, and the solitude Seems shaken with a mighty care. Decay and melancholy drape The near-by hills in mysteries Of mist, through which the rocks and trees Loom, hazy, each a phantom shape. To sullenness the surly crow All his derisive being yields, And o'er the barren stubble-fields Flaps, cawless, wrapped in hungry woe. II Evening As eve comes on the teasel stoops Its spike-crowned cone before the blast: The tattered leaves drive whirling past In frantic and fantastic troops. The matted elder-copses sigh; Their broad, blue combs, with berries weighed, Like heavy pendulums are swayed With every gust that wanders by. Through broken walls of tangled brier, That hedge the lane, the sumachs thrust Their scarlet torches, red as rust, Lit with the sunset's stolid fire. The eve is here: Cold, hard, and drear The cloudless west with livid white Of flaming silver walls the night Far as one star's thin rays appear. Wedged 'thwart the west's white luridness The wild geese wing; from roseless domes The far âhonkâ of the leader comes Lonely and harsh and colorless. The west dies down; and in its cup, Shadow on shadow, pours the night; The east glows with a mystic light; The stars are keen; the moon comes up. THE WHITE EVENING On hills, beneath the steely skies, The wind-tossed forests rock and roar: Along the river's ringing shore Homeward the skimming skater flies. On windy meads of icy brakes, Where, sheathed in sleet, the haw-tree stands, The moon looks down on glistening lands, Where with the cold each bramble shakes. Last night the sleet made white the world: All day the wind moaned in the pines: Now like a wolf, that whines and whines, Like some wild wolf its hate is hurled Against the hut upon the wold, And the one willow by the stream: Where, huddled, in the moon's chill gleam, The houseless hare leaps through the cold. The moon sinks low, the thin new-moon, And with it, like a bit of spar, Sinks down the large white evening-star, Beneath which earth seems crystal-hewn. Slim o'er the tree-tops, weighed with white, The country church's spire doth swell, A scintillating icicle; While fitfully the village light Stabs, stains with sallow stars the dark: Homeward the creaking wagons strain: The smithy glares: the tavern's vane Points northward in its ghostly sark. And from the north, with stinging lash, Driving his herds of snow and sleet, Upon his steed of wind, whose feet Hurl through the iron woods and crash Along the hills, with blow on blow, The tempest sweeps; before his shout The moon and stars are blotted out, And fold on fold rolls down the snow. DREAMS My thoughts have borne me far away To beauties of an older day, Where, crowned with roses, stands the Dawn, Striking her seven-stringed barbiton Of flame, whose chords give being to The seven colors, hue for hue; The music of the color-dream She builds the day from, beam by beam. My thoughts have borne me far away To myths of a diviner day, Where, sitting on the mountain, Noon Sings to the pines a sun-soaked tune Of rest and shade and clouds and skies, Wherein her calm dreams idealize Light as a presence, heavenly fair, Sleeping with all her beauty bare. My thoughts have borne me far away To visions of a wiser day, Where, stealing through the wilderness, Night walks, a sad-eyed votaress, And prays with mystic words she hears Behind the thunder of the spheres, The starry utterance that is hers With which she fills the universe. THE BROOK To it the forest tells The mystery that haunts its heart and folds Its form in cogitation deep, that holds The shadow of each myth that dwells In natureâbe it Nymph or Fay or Faunâ And whispering of them to the dales and dells, It wanders on and on. To it the heaven shows The secret of its soul; true images Of dreams that form its aspect; and with these Reflected in its countenance it goes, With pictures of the skies, the dusk and dawn, Within its breast, as every blossom knows, For them to gaze upon. Through it the world-soul sends Its heart's creating pulse that beats and sings The music of maternity whence springs All life; and shaping earthly ends,â From the deep sources of the heavens drawn,â Planting its ways with beauty, on it wends, On and for ever on. THE OLD SWING Under the boughs of spring She swung in the old rope-swing. Her cheeks, with their happy blood, Glowed pink as the apple-bud. Her eyes, with their deep delight, Shone glad as the stars of night. Her curls, with their romp and fun, Tossed hoiden to wind and sun. Her lips, with their laughter shrill, Rippled like some wild rill. Under the boughs of spring She swung in the old rope-swing. And I,âwho leaned on the fence, Watching her innocence, As, under the boughs that bent, Now high, now low, she went, In her soul the ecstasies Of the stars, the brooks, the breeze,â Had given the rest of my years, With their blessings, and hopes, and fears, To have been as she was then; And, just for a moment, again A boy in the old rope-swing Under the boughs of spring. TO AUTUMN I feel thee as one feels a flower's, A dead flower's fragrance in a room,â A dim, gray grief that haunts the hours With sad perfume. Thou charm'st me as a ghostly lily Might charm a garden's withered space, With the pale pathos and the chilly Hush of thy face. I hearken in thy fogs; I hearken When, like the phantom of dead Night, With immaterial limbs they darken The day with white. With wrecks of rain and mad winds, heaping Red ruins of riven rose and leaf, Make sad my heart, O Autumn! sweeping The world with grief. WINTER DREAMS How does it come that now I go Down ways made blue with bluets' eyes? Along the creek-road as the crow With mocking laughter flies? A wild bird beats a crippled wing To lure me from its brush-built nest; Then, like a brook, I hear it sing Its wildwood happiest. Beyond the orchard hills are dells Of knee-deep huckleberries, white With little bell-blooms, May-time swells With sweetness and delight. The faun wakes in me, wild and keen, And, with the joy the rathe months hold, Kicks happy heels in deeps of green And rolls in deeper gold. My Shakespeare falls: I wake: and frost And ice seam every flower-bed: Where once each stalk, an Edgar, tossed, Poor Tom now shakes instead. Where once th' gladiole, gleaming, shook A wand of folly at the sun, The humped stock hath a withered lookâ The poor, pale Fool is done. A great, gray beard the rose-bush hath,â An old king's,âwhere hangs many a tear, Near the dead lily by the pathâ Cordelia and Lear. TANSY AND SWEET-ALYSSUM A FLOWER OF THE FIELDS Bee-bitten in the orchard hung The peach; or, fallen in the weeds, Lay rotting, where still sucked and sung The gray bee, boring to the seed's Pink pulp and honey blackly stung. The orchard-path, which wound around The garden,âwith its heat one twinge Of dinning locusts,âpicket-bound And ragged, brought me where one hinge Held up the gate that scraped the ground. All seemed the same: the martin-boxâ Sun-warped, with pygmy balconiesâ Still stood, with all its twittering flocks, Perched on its pole above the peas And silvery-seeded onion-stocks. The clove-pink and the rose; the clump Of coppery sunflowers, with the heat Sick to the heart: the garden stump, Red with geraniumâpots, and sweet With moss and ferns, this side the pump. I rested with one hesitant hand Upon the gate. The lonesome day, Droning with insects, made the land One dry stagnation. Soaked with hay And scents of weeds the hot wind fanned. I breathed the sultry scents, my eyes Parched as my lips. And yet I felt My limbs were ice.âAs one who flies To some wild woe.âHow sleepy smelt The hay-hot heat that soaked the skies! Noon nodded; dreamier, lonesomer For one long, plaintive, forest-side Bird-quaver.âAnd I knew me near Some heartbreak anguish. . . . She had died. I felt it, and no need to hear. I passed the quince-and pear-tree; where, All up the porch, a grape-vine trails.â How strange that fruit, whatever air Or earth it grows in, never fails To find its native flavor there! And she was as a flower, too, That grows its proper bloom and scent No matter what the soil: she, who, Born better than her place, still lent Grace to the lowliness she knew. . . . They met me at the porch and were Gaunt-eyed with weeping.âThen the room Shut out the country's heat and purr, And left light stricken into gloomâ So love and I might look on her. ON STONY-RUN O cheerly, cheerly by the road, And merrily down the hillet, And where the bottom-lands are sowed With bristle-bearded millet; Then o'er a pebbled path it goes Through woodland dale and dingle, Unto a farmstead's windowed rose, And roof of moss and shingle. Then darkly, darkly through the brush, And dimly round the boulder, Where cane and water-weeds grow lush, Its current clear flows colder. Then by the cedared way that leads, Through burr and bramble-thickets, Unto a burial-ground of weeds Fenced in with broken pickets. Then slowly, slowly down the vale, And wearily through the rushes, Where sunlight of the noon is pale, Its shadowy water hushes. For oft her young face smiled upon Its deeps here, willow-shaded; And oft with bare feet in the sun Its shallows there she waded. No more beneath the twinkling leaves Shall stand the farmer's daughter!â Sing softly past the cottage eaves, O memory-haunted water! No more shall bend her laughing face Above it where the rose is!â Sigh softly past the burial-place Where all her youth reposes. HOME Among the fields the camomile Seems blown mist in the lightning's glare: Cool, rainy odors drench the air; Night speaks above; the angry smile Of storm within her stare. The way that I shall take to-night Is through the wood whose branches fill The road with double darkness, till, Between the boughs, a window's light Shines out upon the hill. The fence; and then the path that goes Around a trailer-tangled rock, Through puckered pink and hollyhock, Unto a latch-gate's unkempt rose, And door whereat I knock. Bright on the old-time flower-place The lamp streams through the foggy pane: The door is opened to the rain: And in the doorâher happy face And outstretched hands again. DUSK IN THE WOODS Three miles of trees it is: and I Came through the woods that waited, dumb, For the cool summer dusk to come; And lingered there to watch the sky Up which the gradual sunset clomb. A tree-toad quavered in a tree; And then a sudden whippoorwill Called overhead, so wildly shrill The sleeping wood, it seemed to me, Cried out and then again was still. Then through dark boughs its stealthy flight An owl took; and, at drowsy strife, The cricket tuned its fairy fife; And like a ghostflower, silent white, The wood-moth glimmered into life. And in the punk-wood everywhere The insects ticked, or bored below The rotted bark; and, glow on glow, The lambent fireflies here and there Lit up their jack-o'-lantern show. I heard a vesper-sparrow sing, Withdrawn, it seemed, into the far Slow sunset's tranquil cinnabar; The crimson, softly smouldering Behind gaunt trunks, with its one star. A dog barked: and down ways that gleamed, Through dew and clover, faint the noise Of cow-bells moved. And then a voice, That sang a-milking, so it seemed, Made glad my heart as some glad boy's. And then the lane: and, full in view, A farm-house with a rose-grown gate, And honeysuckle paths, await For night, the moon, and love and youâ These are the things that made me late. COMRADES Down through the woods, along the way That fords the stream; by rock and tree, Where in the bramble-bell the bee Swings; and through twilights green and gray The red-bird flashes suddenly, My thoughts went wandering to-day. I found the fields where, row on row, The blackberries hang black their fruit; Where, nesting at the elder's root, The partridge whistles soft and low; The fields, that billow to the foot Of those old hills we used to know. There lay the pond, still willow-bound, On whose bright surface, when the hot Noon burnt above, we chased the knot Of water-striders; while around Our heads, like bits of rainbow, shot The dragon-flies without a sound. The pond, above which evening bent To gaze upon her gypsy face; Wherein the twinkling night would trace A vague, inverted firmament; In which the green frogs tuned their bass, And firefly sparkles came and went. The old-time woods we often ranged, When we were playmates, you and I; The old-time fields, with boyhood's sky Still blue above them!âNaught was changed! Nothing!âAlas! then tell me why Should we be? whom the years estranged. THE ROCK Here, at its base, in dingled deeps Of spice-bush, where the ivy creeps, The cold spring scoops its hollow; And there, three mossy stepping-stones Make ripple murmurs; undertones Of foam, whose low falls follow A voice far in the wood that drones. The quail pipes here when noons are hot; And here, in coolness sunlight-shot, Beneath a roof of briers, The red fox skulks at close of day; And here, at night, the shadows gray Stand like Franciscan friars, With moonbeam beads whereon they pray. Here yawns the woodchuck's dark-dug hole; And there the tunnel of the mole Heaves under weed and flower; A sandy pit-fall here and there The ant-lion digs and lies a-lair And here, for sun and shower, The spider weaves a silvery snare. The poison-oak's rank tendrils twine The rock's south side; the trumpet-vine, With crimson bugles sprinkled, Makes green its eastern side; the west Is rough with lichens; and, gray-pressed Into an angle wrinkled, The hornets hang an oblong nest. The north is hid from sun and star, And here,âlike an Inquisitor Of FaÃ«ry Inquisition, Who roots out Elfland heresy,â Deep in the rock, cowled shadowy And grave as his commission, The owl sits magisterially. STANDING-STONE CREEK A weed-grown slope, whereon the rain Has washed the brown rocks bare, Leads tangled from a lonely lane Down to a creek's broad stair Of stone, that, through the solitude, Winds onward to a quiet wood. An intermittent roof of shade The beech above it throws; Along its steps a balustrade Of beauty builds the rose; In which, a stately lamp of green, At intervals, the cedar 's seen. The water, carpeting each ledge Of rock that runs across, Glints 'twixt a flow'r-embroidered edge Of ferns and grass and moss; And in its deeps the wood and sky Seem patterns of the softest dye. Long corridors of pleasant dusk Within the house of leaves It reaches; where, on looms of musk, The ceaseless locust weaves A web of summer; and perfume Trails a sweet gown from room to room. Green windows of the boughs, that swing, It passes, where the notes Of birds are glad thoughts entering, And butterflies are motes; And now a vista where the day Opens a door of wind and ray. It is a stairway for all sounds That haunt the woodland sides; On which, boy-like, the Southwind bounds, Girl-like, the sunbeam glides; And, like fond parents, following these, The old-time dreams of rest and peace. âCLOUDS OF THE AUTUMN NIGHTâ Clouds of the autumn night, Under the hunter's-moon,â Ghostly and windy white,â Whither, like leaves wild strewn, Take ye your stormy flight? Out of the west, where dusk, From her red window-sill, Leaned with a wand of tusk, Witch-like, and wood and hill Phantomed with mist and musk Into the east, where morn Sleeps in a shadowy close, Shut with a gate of horn, Round which the dreams she knows Flutter with rose and thorn. Blow from the west! oh, blow, Clouds that the tempest steers! And with your rain and snow Bear of my heart the tears, And of my soul the woe. Into the east then pass, Clouds that the night-winds sweep! And on her grave's sere grass, There where she lies asleep, There let them fall, alas! THEN AND NOW When my old heart was young, my dear, The earth and heaven were so near That in my dreams I oft could hear The steps of airy races; In woodlands, where bright waters ran, On hills, God's rainbows used to span, I followed voices not of man, And smiled in spirit faces. Now my old heart is old, my sweet, No longer earth and heaven meet; All life is grown to one dull street Where fact with fancy clashes; The voices now that speak to me Are prose instead of poetry; And in the faces now I see Is less of flame than ashes. BY THE TRYSTING-BEECH Deep in the west a berry-colored bar Of sunset gleams; against which one tall fir Stands outlined dark; above whichâcourier Of dew and dreamsâburns dusk's appointed star. And flash on flash, as when the elves wage war In Goblinland, the fireflies bombard The silence; and, like spirits, o'er the sward The twilight winds bring fragrance from afar. And now, withdrawn into the hill-wood belts, A whippoorwill; while, with attendant states Of pearl and silver, slow the great moon melts Into the nightâto show me where she waits,â Like some slim moonbeam,âby the old beech-tree, Who keeps her lips, fresh as a flower, for me. AFTER LONG GRIEF AND PAIN There is a place hung o'er of summer boughs And dreamy skies wherein the gray hawk sleeps; Where waters flow, within whose lazy deeps, Like silvery prisms where the sunbeams drowse, The minnows twinkle; where the bells of cows Tinkle the stillness; and the bob-white keeps Calling from meadows where the reaper reaps, And children's laughter haunts an old-time house: A place where life wears ever an honest smell Of hay and honey, sun and elder-bloomâ Like some sweet, modest girlâwithin her hair; Where, with our love for comrade, we may dwell Far from the city's strife, whose cares consumeâ Oh, take my hand and let me lead you there. THE HAUNTED WOODLAND Here in the golden darkness And green night of the woods, A flitting form I follow, A shadow that eludesâ Or is it but the phantom Of former forest moods? The phantom of some fancy I knew when I was young, And in my dreaming boyhood, The wildwood flow'rs among, Young face to face with FaÃ«ry Spoke in no unknown tongue. Blue were her eyes, and golden The nimbus of her hair; And scarlet as a flower Her mouth that kissed me there; That kissed and bade me follow, And smiled away my care. A magic and a marvel Lived in her word and look, As down among the blossoms She sate me by the brook, And read me wonder-legends In Nature's Story Book. Loved fairy-tales forgotten, She never reads again, Of beautiful enchantments That haunt the sun and rain, And, in the wind and water, Chant a mysterious strain. And so I search the forest, Wherein my spirit feels, In stream, or tree, or flower Herself she still concealsâ But now she flies who followed, Whom Earth no more reveals. COMRADERY With eyes hand-arched he looks into The morning's face, then turns away With school-boy feet, all wet with dew, Out for a holiday. The hill brook sings; incessant stars, Foam-fashioned, on its restless breast; And where he wades its water-bars Its song is happiest. A comrade of the chinquapin, He looks into its knotty eyes And sees its heart; and, deep within, Its soul that makes him wise. The wood-thrush knows and follows him, Who whistles up the birds and bees; And round him all the perfumes swim Of woodland loam and trees. Where'er he pass the supple springs' Foam-people sing the flowers awake; And sappy lips of bark-clad things Laugh ripe each fruited brake. His touch is a companionship; His word, an old authority: He comes, a lyric on his lip, Unstudied Poesy. OCCULT Unto the soul's companionship Of things that only seem to be, Earth points with magic finger-tip And bids thee see How Fancy keeps thee company. For oft at dawn hast not beheld A spirit of prismatic hue Blow wide the buds, which night hath swelled? And stain them through With heav'n's ethereal gold and blue? While at her side another went With gleams of enigmatic white? A spirit who distributes scent, To vale and height, In footsteps of the rosy light? And oft at dusk hast thou not seen The star-fays bring their caravans Of dew, and glitter all the green, Night's shadow tans, With drops the rain-hung cobweb spans? Nor watched with these the elfins go Who tune faint instrumentsâthat sound Like that moon-music insects blow?â Then haunted ground Thou hast not trodden, never found! WOOD-WORDS I The spirits of the forest, That to the winds give voiceâ I lie the livelong April day And wonder what it is they say That makes the leaves rejoice. The spirits of the forest, That breathe in bud and bloomâ I walk within the haw-tree brake And wonder how it is they make The bubbles of perfume. The spirits of the forest, That dwell in every springâ I lean above the brook's bright blue And wonder what it is they do That makes the water sing. The spirits of the forest, That haunt the sun's green glowâ Down fungus ways of fern I steal And would surprise what they conceal, In dew, that twinkles so. O spirits of the forest, Here are my heart and hand!â Oh, send a gleam or glow-worm ray To guide my soul the firefly way That leads to Fairyland. II The time when dog-tooth violets Hold up inverted horns of gold,â The elvish cups that Spring upsets With dripping feet, when April wets The sun-and-shadow-marbled wold,â Is come. And by each leafing way The sorrel drops pale blots of pink; And, like an angled star a fay Sets on her forehead's pallid day, The blossoms of the trillium wink. Within the vale, by rock and stream,â A fragile, fairy porcelain,â Blue as a baby's eyes a-dream, The bluets blow; and gleam in gleam The sun-shot dogwoods flash with rain. It is the time to cast off care; To make glad intimates of these:â The frank-faced sunbeam laughing there: The great-heart wind, that bids us share The optimism of the trees. III The white ghosts of the flowers, The gray ghosts of the trees, Rise when the April showers, And haunt the wildwood bowers, And trail along the breeze: The white ghosts of the flowers, The gray ghosts of the trees. Oft in the woodless places I feel their dim control; The wildflowers' perished faces, The great trees' vanished races, That meet me soul to soul: Oft in the woodless places I feel their dim control. IV Crab-apple buds, whose bells The mouth of April kissed; That hang,âlike rosy shells Around a Naiad's wrist,â Pink as dawn-tinted mist. And paw-paw buds, whose dark Deep auburn blossoms shake On boughs,âas 'neath the bark A dryad's eyes awake,â Brown as a midnight lake. These, with symbolic blooms Of wind-flower and wild-phlox, I found among the glooms Of hill-lost woods and rocks, Lairs of the hare and fox. The beetle in the brush, The bird about the creek, The bee within the hush, And I, whose love was meek, Stood still to hear these speak The language that records, In flower-syllables, The hieroglyphic words Of beauty, who enspells The world and aye compels. THE WIND AT NIGHT I Not till the wildman wind is shrill, Howling upon the hill In every wolfish tree, whose boisterous boughs, Like desperate arms, gesture and beat the night, And down huge clouds, in chasms of stormy white, The frightened moon hurries above the house, Shall I lie down; and, deep,â Letting the mad wind keep Its shouting revel round me,âfall asleep. II Not till its dark halloo is hushed, And where wild waters rushed,â Like some hoof'd terror underneath its whip And spur of foam,âremains A ghostly glass, hill-framed; whereover stains Of moony mists and rains, And stealthy starbeams, still as spectres, slip; Shall Iâwith thoughts that take Unto themselves the ache Of silence as a soundâfrom sleep awake. AIRY TONGUES I There is a song the wet leaves lisp When Morn comes down the woodland way; And misty as a thistle-wisp Her gown gleams, windy gray: A song that seems to say, âAwake! 't is day!â There is a sigh when Day sits down Beside the sunlight-lulled lagoon; While on her glistening hair and gown The rose of rest is strewn: A sigh, that seems to croon, âCome rest! 't is noon!â There is a whisper when the stars, Above an evening-purpled height, Crown the dead Day with nenuphars Of fire, gold and white: A voice, that seems t' invite, âCome love! 't is night!â II Before the rathe song-sparrow sings Among the haw-trees in the lane, And to the wind the locust flings Its early clusters fresh with rain; Beyond the morning-star, that swings Its rose of fire above the spire, Between the morning's watchet wings, A wild voice rings o'er brooks and boughsâ âArouse! arouse!â Before the first brown owlet cries Among the grape-vines on the hill, And in the dam with half-shut eyes The lilies rock above the mill; Beyond the oblong moon, that flies, A pearly flower, above the tower, Between the twilight's primrose skies, A soft voice sighs, from east to westâ âTo rest! to rest!â RAIN AND WIND I hear the hoofs of horses Galloping over the hill, Galloping on and galloping on, When all the night is shrill With wind and rain that beats the paneâ And my soul with awe is still. For every dripping window Their headlong rush makes bound, Galloping up, and galloping by, Then back again and around, Till the gusty roofs ring with their hoofs, And the draughty cellars sound. And then I hear black horsemen Hallooing in the night; Hallooing and hallooing, They ride o'er vale and height, And the branches snap and the shutters clap With the fury of their flight. Then at each door a horseman,â With burly bearded lip Hallooing through the keyhole,â Pauses with cloak a-drip; And the door-knob shakes and the panel quakes 'Neath the anger of his whip. All night I hear their gallop, And their wild halloo's alarm; The tree-tops sound and the vanes go round In forest and on farm; But never a hair of a thing is thereâ Only the wind and storm. UNDER ARCTURUS I âI belt the morn with ribboned mist; With baldricked blue I gird the noon, And dusk with purple, crimson-kissed, White-buckled with the hunter's-moon. âThese follow me,â the Season says: âMine is the frost-pale hand that packs Their scrips, and speeds them on their ways, With gipsy gold that weighs their backs.â II A daybreak horn the Autumn blows, As with a sun-tanned hand he parts Wet boughs whereon the berry glows; And at his feet the red fox starts. The leafy leash that holds his hounds Is loosed; and all the noonday hush Is startled; and the hillside sounds Behind the fox's bounding brush. When red dusk makes the western sky A fire-lit window through the firs, He stoops to see the red fox die Among the chestnut's broken burrs. Then fanfaree and fanfaree, His bugle sounds; the world below Grows hushed to hear; and two or three Soft stars dream through the afterglow. III Like some black host the shadows fall, And blackness camps among the trees; Each wildwood road, a Goblin Hall, Grows populous with mysteries. Night comes with brows of ragged storm, And limbs of writhen cloud and mist; The rain-wind hangs upon his arm Like some wild girl who cries unkissed. By his gaunt hands the leaves are shed In headlong troops and nightmare herds; And, like a witch who calls the dead, The hill-stream whirls with foaming words. Then all is sudden silence and Dark fearâlike his who can not see, Yet hears, lost in a haunted land, Death rattling on a gallow's-tree. IV The days approach again; the days Whose mantles stream, whose sandals drag When in the haze by puddled ways The gnarled thorn seems a crookÃ©d hag. When rotting orchards reek with rain; And woodlands crumble, leaf and log; And in the drizzling yard again The gourd is tagged with points of fog. Now let me seat my soul among The woods' dim dreams, and come in touch With melancholy, sad of tongue And sweet, who says so much, so much. BARE BOUGHS O heart,âthat beat the bird's blithe blood, The blithe bird's strain, and understood The song it sang to leaf and bud,â What dost thou in the wood? O soul,âthat kept the brook's glad flow, The glad brook's word to sun and moon,â What dost thou here where song lies low, Dead as the dreams of June? Where once was heard a voice of song, The hautboys of the mad winds sing; Where once a music flowed along, The rain's wild bugles ring. The weedy water frets and ails, And moans in many a sunless fall; And, o'er the melancholy, trails The black crow's eldritch call. Unhappy brook! O withered wood! O days, whom death makes comrades of! Where are the birds that thrilled the blood When Life struck hands with Love? A song, one soared against the blue; A song, one bubbled in the leaves: A song, one threw where orchards grew Red-appled to the eaves. The birds are flown; the flowers are dead; And sky and earth are bleak and gray; The wild winds hang i' the boughs instead, And wild leaves strew the way. A THRENODY I The rainy smell of a ferny dell, Whose shadow no sun-ray flaws, When Autumn sits in the wayside weeds Telling her beads Of haws. II The phantom mist, that is moonbeam-kissed, On hills where the trees are thinned, When Autumn leans at the oak-root's scarp, Touching a harp Of wind. III The cricket's chirr 'neath brier and burr, By leaf-strewn pools and streams, When Autumn stands 'mid the dropping nuts, With the book, she shuts, Of dreams. IV The gray âAlasâ of the days that pass, And the hope that says âAdieu,â A parting sorrow, a shriveled flower, And one ghost's hour With you. SNOW The moon, like a round device On a shadowy shield of war, Hangs white in a heaven of ice With a solitary star. The wind is sunk to a sigh, And the waters are steeled with frost; And gray in the eastern sky The last snow-cloud is lost. White fields, that are winter-starved; Black woods, that are winter-fraught; And Earth like a face death-carved With the iron of some black thought. AN OLD SONG I It's, Oh, for the hills, where the wind's some one With a vagabond foot that follows! And a cheer-up hand that he claps upon Your arm with the hearty words, âCome on! We'll soon be out of the hollows, My heart! We'll soon be out of the hollows!â II It 's, Oh, for the songs, where the hope 's some one With a renegade foot that doubles! And a kindly look that he turns upon Your face with the friendly laugh, âCome on! We 'll soon be out of the troubles, My heart! We 'll soon be out of the troubles!â BABY MARY Deep in baby Mary's eyes, Baby Mary's sweet blue eyes, Dwell the golden memories Of the music once her ears Heard in far-off Paradise: So she has no time for tears,â Baby Mary,â Listening to the songs she hears. Soft in baby Mary's face, Baby Mary's lovely face, If you watch, you, too, may trace Dreams her spirit-self hath seen In some far-off Eden-place, Whence her soul she can not wean,â Baby Mary,â Dreaming in a world between. A SUNSET FANCY Wide in the west a lake Of flame that seems to shake As if the Midgard snake Deep down did breathe: An isle of purple glow, Where rosy rivers flow Down peaks of cloudy snow With fire beneath. And there the Tower-of-Night, With windows all a-light, Frowns on a burning height, Wherein she sleeps,â Young through the years of doom,â Veiled with her hair's gold gloom, She, the Valkyrie, whom Enchantment keeps. THE FEN-FIRE The misty rain makes dim my face, The night's black cloak is o'er me; I tread the dripping cypress-place, A flickering light before me. Out of the death of leaves that rot And ooze and weedy water, My form was breathed to haunt this spot, Death's immaterial daughter. The owl that whoops upon the yew, The snake that lairs within it, Have seen my wild face flashing blue For one fantastic minute. But should you follow where my eyes Like some pale lamp decoy you, Beware! lest suddenly I rise With love that shall destroy you. THE WOOD Witch-hazel, dogwood, and the maple here; And there the oak and hickory; Linn, poplar, and the beech-tree, far and near As the eased eye can see. Wild-ginger; wahoo, with its flat balloons; And brakes of briers of a twilight green; And fox-grapes plumed with summer; and strung moons Of mandrake flowers between. Deep gold-green ferns, and mosses green and gray,â Mats for what naked myth's white feet?â And, cool and calm, a cascade far away With ever-even beat. Old logs, made sweet with death; rough bits of bark; And tangled twig and knotted root; And sunshine splashes and great pools of dark; And many a wild-bird's flute. Here let me sit until the Indian, Dusk, With copper-colored face, comes down; Sowing the wildwood with star-fire and musk, And shadows blue and brown. Then side by side with some magician Dream, I 'll take the owlet-haunted lane,â Half-roofed with vines,âled by a firefly gleam, That brings me home again. WOOD NOTES I There is a flute that follows me From tree to tree: A water flute a spirit sets To silver lips in waterfalls, And through the breath of violets A sparkling music calls:â âHither! halloo! Oh, follow! Down leafy hill and hollow, Where, through clear swirls, With feet like pearls, Wade down the blue-eyed country girls. Hither! halloo! Oh, follow!â II There is a pipe that plays to me From tree to tree: A bramble pipe an elfin holds To golden lips in berry brakes, And, swinging o'er the elder wolds, A flickering music makes:â âCome over! Come over The new-mown clover! Come over the fresh-cut hay! Where, there by the berries, With cheeks like cherries, And locks with which the warm wind merries, Brown girls are hilling the hay, All day! Come over the fields and away!â Come over! Come over!â HILLS OF THE WEST Hills of the west, that gird Forest and farm, Home of the nesting bird, Housing from harm, When, on your tops, is heard Storm. Hills of the west, that bar Belts of the gloam, Under the twilight's star, Where the mists roam, Take ye the wanderer Home. Hills of the west, that dream Under the moon, Making of wind and stream, Late heard and soon, Parts of your lives that seem Tune. Hills of the west, that take Silence to ye, Be it for sorrow's sake Or memory, Part of such silence make Me. THE WIND OF SPRING The wind that breathes of columbines And celandines that crowd the rocks; That shakes the balsam of the pines With music from his airy locks, Stops at my city door and knocks. He calls me far a-forest, where The twin-leaf and the blood-root bloom; And, circled by the amber air, Life sits with beauty and perfume Weaving the new web of her loom. He calls me where the waters run Through fronding fern where wades the hern; And, sparkling in the equal sun, Song leans beside her brimming urn, And dreams the dreams that love shall learn. The wind has summoned, and I go: To con God's meaning in each line The wildflow'rs write; and, walking slow, God's purpose, of which song is sign,â The wind's great, gusty hand in mine. THE WILLOW BOTTOM Lush green the grass that grows between The willows of the bottom-land; Edged by the careless water, tall and green The brown-topped cat-tails stand. The cows come gently here to browse, Slow through the great-leafed sycamores: You hear a dog bark from a low-roofed house With cedars round its doors. Then all is quiet as the wings Of the one buzzard floating there: Anon a woman's high-pitched voice that sings An old camp-meeting air. A cock that flaps and crows; and thenâ Heard drowsy through the rustling cornâ A flutter, and the crackling of a hen Within a hay-sweet barn. How still again! no water stirs: No wind is heard: although the weeds Are waved a little: and from silk-filled burrs Drift by a few soft seeds. So drugged with dreams the place, that you Expect to see her gliding by,â Hummed round of bees, through blossoms spilling dew,â The Spirit of July. THE RED-BIRD Red clouds and reddest flowers, And now two redder wings Swim through the rosy hours; Red wings among the flowers; And now the red-bird sings. God makes the red clouds ripples Of flame that seem to split In rubies and in dripples Of rose where rills and ripples The singing flame that lit. Red clouds of sundered splendor; God whispered one small word, Rich, sweet, and wild and tenderâ Straight, in the vibrant splendor, The word became a bird. He flies beneath the garnet Of clouds that flame and float,â When summer hears the hornet Hum round the plum, turned garnet,â Heaven's music in his throat. CLEARING Before the wind, with rain-drowned stocks, The pleated, crimson hollyhocks Are bending; And, smouldering in the breaking brown, Above the hills that rim the town, The day is ending. The air is heavy with the damp; And, one by one, each cottage lamp Is lighted; Infrequent passers of the street Stroll on or stop to talk or greet, Benighted. I look beyond my city yard, And watch the white moon struggling hard, Cloud-buried; The wind is driving toward the east, A wreck of pearl, all cracked and creased And serried. At times the moon, erupting, streaks Some long cloud, raised in mountain peaks Of shadow,â That, seamed with silver, vein on vein, Grows to a far volcano chain Of Eldorado. The wind, that blows from out the hills, Is like a woman's touch that stills A sorrow: The moon sits high with many a star In the deep calm: and fair and far Abides to-morrow. AUTUMN SORROW Ah me! too soon the Autumn comes Among these purple-plaintive hills! Too soon among the forest gums Premonitory flame she spills, Bleak, melancholy flame that kills. Her white fogs veil the morn, that rims With wet the moon-flow'r's elfin moons; And, like exhausted starlight, dims The last slim lily-disk; and swoons With scents of hazy afternoons. Her gray mists haunt the sunset skies, And build the west's cadaverous fire, Where Sorrow sits with lonely eyes, And hands that wake her ancient lyre, Beside the ghost of dead Desire. A DARK DAY OF SUMMER Though Summer walks the world to-day With corn-crowned hours for her guard, Her thoughts have clad themselves in gray, And wait in Autumn's weedy yard. And where the larkspur and the phlox Spread carpets for her feet to pass, She stands with sombre, dripping locks Bound bleak with fog-washed zinnias. Sad terra-cotta-colored flowers, Whose disks the trickling wet has tinged With dingy lustre, like the bowers, Flame-flecked with leaves, the frost has singed. She, with slow feet,â'mid gaunt gold blooms Of marigolds her fingers twist,â Passes, dim-swathed in Fall's perfumes And dreams of sullen rain and mist. DAYS AND DAYS The days that clothed white limbs with heat, And rocked the red rose on their breast, Have passed with amber-sandaled feet, Into the ruby-gated west. These were the days that filled the heart With overflowing riches of Life; in whose soul no dream shall start But hath its origin in love. Now come the days gray-huddled in The haze; whose foggy footsteps drip; Who pin beneath a gypsy chin The frosty marigold and hip.â The days, whose forms fall shadowy Athwart the heart; whose misty breath Shapes saddest sweets of memory Out of the bitterness of death. DROUTH IN AUTUMN Gnarled acorn-oaks against a west Of copper, cavernous with fire; A wind of frost that gives no rest To such lean leaves as haunt the brier, And hide the cricket's vibrant wire. Sere, shivering shocks, and stubble blurred With bramble-blots of dull maroon; And creekless hills whereon no herd Finds pasture, and whereo'er the loon Flies, haggard as the rainless moon. IN SUMMER When in dry hollows, hilled with hay, The vesper-sparrow sings afar; And golden gray dusk dies away Beneath the amber evening-star: There, where a warm and shadowy arm The woodland lays around the farm, I'll meet you at the tryst, the tryst! And kiss your lips no man hath kissed! I'll meet you at the twilight tryst,â With a hey and a ho!â Sweetheart! I'll kiss you at the tryst! When clover fields smell cool with dew, And crickets cry, and roads are still; And faint and few the fireflies strew The dark where calls the whippoorwill; There, in the lane, where sweet again The petals of the wild-rose rain, I'll take in mine your hand, your hand! And say the words you 'll understand! Your soft hand nestling in my hand,â With a hey and a ho!â Sweetheart! All loving hand in hand! IN WINTER I When black frosts pluck the acorns down, And in the lane the waters freeze; And 'thwart red skies the wild-fowl flies, And death sits grimly in the trees; When home-lights glitter through the brown Of dusk like shaggy eyes,â Before the door his feet, sweetheart, And two white arms that greet, sweetheart, And two white arms that greet. II When ways are drifted with the leaves, And winds make music in the thorns; And lone and lost above the frost The new-moon shows its silver horns; When underneath the lamplit eaves The opened door is crossed,â A happy heart and light, sweetheart, And lips that kiss good night, sweetheart, And lips that kiss good night. ON THE FARM I He sang a song as he sowed the field, Sowed the field at break of day: âWhen the pursed-up leaves are as lips that yield Balm and balsam, and Spring,âconcealed In the odorous green,âis so revealed, Halloo and oh! Hallo for the woods and the far away!â II He trilled a song as he mowed the mead, Mowed the mead as noon begun: âWhen the hills are gold with the ripened seed, As the sunset stairs of the clouds that lead To the sky where Summer knows naught of need, Halloo and oh! Hallo for the hills and the harvest sun!â III He hummed a song as he swung the flail, Swung the flail in the afternoon: âWhen the idle fields are a wrecker's tale, That the Autumn tells to the twilight pale, As the Year turns seaward a crimson sail, Halloo and oh! Hallo for the fields and the hunter's-moon!â IV He whistled a song as he shouldered his axe, Shouldered his axe in the evening storm: âWhen the snow of the road shows the rabbit's tracks, And the wind is a whip that the Winter cracks, With a herdsman's cry, o'er the clouds black backs, Halloo and oh! Hallo for home and a fire to warm!â PATHS I What words of mine can tell the spell Of garden ways I know so well?â The path that takes me, in the spring, Past quince-trees where the bluebirds sing, Where peonies are blossoming, Unto a porch, wistaria-hung, Around whose steps May-lilies blow, A fair girl reaches down among, Her arm more white than their sweet snow. II What words of mine can tell the spell Of garden ways I know so well?â Another path that leads me, when The summer-time is here again, Past hollyhocks that shame the west When the red sun has sunk to rest; To roses bowering a nest, A lattice, 'neath which mignonette And deep geraniums surge and sough, Where, in the twilight, starless yet, A fair girl's eyes are stars enough. III What words of mine can tell the spell Of garden ways I know so well?â A path that takes me, when the days Of autumn wrap the hills in haze, Beneath the pippin-pelting tree, 'Mid flitting butterfly and bee; Unto a door where, fiery, The creeper climbs; and, garnet-hued, The cock's-comb and the dahlia flare, And in the door, where shades intrude, Gleams bright a fair girl's sunbeam hair. IV What words of mine can tell the spell Of garden ways I know so well?â A path that brings me through the frost Of winter, when the moon is tossed In clouds; beneath great cedars, weak With shaggy snow; past shrubs blown bleak With shivering leaves; to eaves that leak The tattered ice, whereunder is A fire-flickering window-space; And in the light, with lips to kiss, A fair girl's welcome-giving face. A SONG IN SEASON I When in the wind the vane turns round, And round, and round; And in his kennel whines the hound: When all the gable eaves are bound With icicles of ragged gray, A tattered gray; There is little to do, and much to say, And you hug your fire and pass the day With a thought of the springtime, dearie. II When late at night the owlet hoots, And hoots, and hoots; And wild winds make of keyholes flutes: When to the door the goodman's boots Stamp through the snow the light strains red, The firelight's red; There is nothing to do, and all is said, And you quaff your cider and go to bed And dream of the summer, dearie. III When, nearing dawn, the black cock crows, And crows, and crows; And from the barn the milch-cow lows: And the milkmaid's cheeks have each a rose, And the still skies show a star or two, Or one or two; There is little to say, and much to do, And the heartier done the happier you, With a song of the winter, dearie. BEFORE THE END How does the Autumn in her mind conclude The tragic masque her frosty pencil writes, Broad on the pages of the days and nights, In burning lines of orchard, wold, and wood? What lonelier formsâthat at the year's door stood At spectral waitâwith wildly wasted lights Shall enter? and with melancholy rites Inaugurate their sadder sisterhood?â Sorrow, who lifts a signal hand, and slow The green leaf fevers, falling ere it dies; Regret, whose pale lips summon: and gaunt Woe Wakes the wild wind-harps with sonorous sighs; And Sleep, who sits with poppied eyes and sees The earth and sky grow dream-accessories. HOAR-FROST The frail eidolons of all blossoms Spring, Year after year, about the forest tossed, The magic touch of the enchanter, Frost, Back from the Heaven of the Flow'rs doth bring; Each branch and bush in silence visiting With phantom beauty of its blooms long lost: Each dead weed bends, white-haunted of its ghost, Each dead flower stands ghostly with blossoming. This is the wonder-legend Nature tells To the gray moon and mist a winter's night; The fairy-tale which from her fancy wells With all the glamour of her soul's delight: Before the summoning sorcery of her eyes Rising, as might a dream materialize. COLD A mist that froze beneath the moon and shook Minutest frosty crystals in the air. All night the wind was still as lonely Care Who sighs before her shivering inglenook. The face of Winter wore a crueler look Than when he shakes the icicles from his hair, And, in the boisterous pauses, lets his stare Freeze through the forest, fettering bough and brook. He is the despot now who sits and dreams Of desolation and despair, and smiles At poverty, who hath no place to rest, Who wanders o'er Life's snow-made-pathless miles, And sees the Home-of-Comfort's window gleams, Hugging her rag-wrapped baby to her breast. THE WINTER MOON Deep in the dell I watched her as she rose, A face of icy fire, o'er the hills; With snow-sad eyes that froze the forest rills, And snow-sad feet that bleached the meadow snows: Pale as some young witch who, a-listening, goes To her first meeting with the Fiend; whose fears Fix demon eyes behind each bush she nears; Stops, yet must on, fearful of following foes. And so I chased her, startled in the wood Like a discovered oread, who flies The faun who found her sleeping, each nude limb Glittering betrayal through the solitude; Till in a frosty cloud I saw her swim Like a drowned face, a blur beneath the ice. THE HILLSIDE GRAVE Ten-thousand deep the drifted daisies break Here at the hill's foot; on its top, the wheat Hangs meagre-bearded; and, in vague retreat, The wisp-like blooms of the moth-mulleins shake. And where the wild-pink drops a crimson flake, And morning-glories, like young lips, make sweet The shadowed hush, low in the honeyed heat, The wild-bees humâas if afraid to wake One sleeping here, with no white stone to tell If it be youth or maiden. Just the stem Of one wild rose, towering o'er brier and weed, Where all the day the wild-birds requiem; Within whose shade the timid violets spell An epitaph, the stars alone can read. THE COVERED BRIDGE There, from its entrance, lost in matted vines,â Where in the valley foams a waterfall,â Is glimpsed a ruined mill's remaining wall; Here, by the road, the black-eyed Susan mines Hot brass and bronze; the trumpet-trailer shines Red as the plumage of the cardinal. Faint from the forest comes the rain-crow's call Where dusty Summer dreams among the pipes. This is the spot where Spring writes wildflower verses In primrose pink, while, drowsing o'er his reins, The ploughman, all unnoticing, plods along: And where the Autumn opens weedy purses Of sleepy silver, while the corn-piled wains Rumble the bridge like some deep throat of song. THE CREEK-ROAD Calling, the heron flies athwart the blue That sleeps above it; reach on rocky reach Of water sings by sycamore and beech, In whose warm shade bloom lilies not a few. It is a page whereon the sun and dew Scrawl sparkling words in dawn's delicious speech; A laboratory where the wood-winds teach, Dissect each scent and analyze each hue. Not otherwise than beautiful, doth it Record the happenings of each summer day; Where we may read, as in a catalogue, When passed a thresher; when a load of hay; Or when a rabbit; or a bird, that lit; And now a barefoot truant and his dog. ABANDONED The hornets build in plaster dropping rooms, And on its mossy porch the lizard lies; Around its chimneys slow the swallow flies, And on its roof the locusts snow their blooms. Like some sad thought that broods here, old perfumes Haunt its dim stairs; the cautious zephyr tries Each gusty door, like some dead hand, then sighs With ghostly lips among the attic glooms. And now a heron, now a kingfisher, Flits in the willows where the riffle seems At each faint fall to hesitate to leap, Fluttering the silence with a little stir. Here Summer seems a placid face asleep, And the near world a figment of her dreams. OMENS Sad on the hills the poppied sunset died. Slow as a fungus breaking through the crusts Of forest leaves, the waning half-moon thrusts Through gray-brown clouds one milky silver side; In her vague light the dogwoods, dim-descried, Seem dying torches flourished by the gusts; The apple-orchards seem the restless dusts Of wind-thinned mists upon the hills they hide. It is a night of omens whom late May Meets, like a wraith, among her train of hours; An apparition with appealing eye And hesitant foot, that walks a willowed way, And, speaking through the fading moon and flowers, Bids her prepare her gentle soul to die. IMPERFECTION Not as the eye hath seen shall we behold Romance and beauty when we've passed away; That robed the dull facts of the intimate day In life's wild raiment of unusual gold: Not as the ear hath heard shall we be told, Hereafter, myth and legend once that lay Warm at the heart of Nature, clothing clay In attributes of no material mold. These were imperfect of necessity, That wrought through imperfection for far ends Of perfectnessâas calm philosophy, Teaching a child, from his high heaven descends To earth's familiar things; informingly Vesting his thoughts in that it comprehends. ARCANA Earth hath her images of utterance, Her hieroglyphic meanings which elude; A symbol language of similitude, Into whose secrets science may not glance; In which the Mind-in-Nature doth romance In miracles that baffle if pursuedâ No guess shall search them and no thought intrude Beyond the limits of her sufferance. So doth the great Intelligence above Hide His own thought's creations; and attire Forms in the dream's ideal, which He dowers With immaterial loveliness and loveâ As essences of fragrance and of fireâ Preaching th' evangels of the stars and flowers. FULFILLMENT There are some souls who may look in on these Essential peoples of the earth and airâ That have the stars and flowers in their careâ And read their soul-suggestive secrecies: Heart-intimates and comrades of the trees, Who from them learn, what no known schools declare, God's knowledge; and from winds, that, singing, fare, God's gospel, filled with mighty harmonies. Souls, unto whom the waves impart a word Of fuller faith; the sunset and the dawn Preach sermons more inspired even than The tongues of Pentecost; as, distant heard In forms of change, through Nature upward drawn, God doth address th' immortal part of Man. TOO LATE I looked upon a dead girl's face and heard What seemed the voice of Death cry out to me, Deep in her heart, all of the agony Of her lost dreams, complaining word on word:â How on her soul no soul had touched, or stirred Her life's sad depths to rippling melody, Or made the imaged longing, there, to be The realization of a hope deferred. So in her life had Love behaved to her. Between the lonely chapters of her years And her young eyes making no golden blur With god-bright face and hair; who led me to Her side at last, and bade me, through my tears, With Death's dumb lips, too late, to see and know. THE WITCH She gropes and hobbles, where the dropsied rocks Are hairy with the lichens and the twist Of knotted wolf's-bane, mumbling in the mist, Hawk-nosed and wrinkle-eyed with scrawny locks. At her bent back the moon, slow-sinking, mocks, Like some lewd evil whom the Fiend hath kissed; Once at her feet the slipping serpent hissed, And once the owl called to the forest fox.â What Sabboth brew does she intend? What root Now seek for, seal for what satanic spell Of incantations and demonic fire?â From her rude hut, hill-huddled in the brier, What dark Familiar points her sure pursuit, There, with gaunt eyes, red with the glow of Hell? THE SOMNAMBULIST Oaks and a water. By the waterâeyes, Ice-green and steadfast as still stars; and hair Yellow as eyes deep in a she-wolf's lair; And limbsâlike mist the lightning's flicker dyes. The humped oaks huddle under iron skies; The dry wind whirls the dead leaves everywhere; White on the water falls a vulture-glare Of moon, and black the circling raven flies. Again the power of this thing hath laid Compulsion on me: and I seem to hear A sweet voice calling me beyond the gates To longed-for love: I come: each forest glade Seems reaching out white arms to draw me nearâ Nearer and nearer to the death that waits. OPIUM On reading De Quincey's âConfessions of an Opium Eater.â I seemed to stand before a temple walled From shadows and night's unrealities; Filled with dark music of dead memories, And voices,âlost in darkness,âdeep that called. I entered. And beneath the dome's high-halled Immensity one forced me to my knees Before a blacknessâthroned 'mid semblances And spectresâcrowned with flames of emerald. Then, lo! two shapes that thundered at mine ears The names of Horror and Oblivion,â Priests of this god,âand bade me die and dream. Then, in the heart of Hell, a thousand years Meseemed I layâdead! while the iron stream Of Time beat out the seconds, one by one. MUSIC AND SLEEP These have a life that hath no part in death: These circumscribe the soul and make it strong: Between the breathing of a dream and song, Building a world of beauty in a breath. Unto the heart the voice of this one saith Ideals, its emotions live among; Unto the mind the other speaks a tongue Of visions, where the guess,âmen christen Faith,â May face the fact of immortalityâ As may a rose its unembodied scent, Or star its own reflected radiance. We do not know these save subconsciously, To whose mysterious shadows God hath lent No certain shape, no certain countenance. AMBITION Now to my lips lift thou some opiate Of dull forgetfulness! while in thy gaze Still lures the loveless beauty that betrays, And in thy mouth the music that is hate. No promise more hast thou to make me wait; No smile to cozen my sick heart with praise! Far, far behind thee stretch laborious days, And far before thee, labors soon and late. Thine is the fen-fire that we deem a star, Flying before us, ever fugitive, Thy mocking policy still holds afar: And thine the voice to which our longings give Hope's siren face, that speaks us sweet and fair, Only at last to whelm us with despair. DESPONDENCY Not all the bravery that day puts on Of gold and azure, ardent or austere, Shall ease my soul of sorrow; grief, more dear Than all the joy that heavenly hope may don. Far up the skies the rumor of the dawn May run, and eve like some wild torch appear; These shall not change the darkness, gathered here, Of thought that rusts like an old sword undrawn. Oh, for a place far-sunken from the sun! A wildwood cave of primitive rocks and moss! Where Sleep and Silenceâbreast to married breastâ Lie with their child, night-eyed Oblivion; Where, freed from all the burden of my cross, I might forget, I might forgetâand rest! DESPAIR Shut in with phantoms of life's hollow hopes, And shadows of old sins satiety slew, And the young ghosts of the dead dreams love knew, Out of the day into the night she gropes. Behind her, high the silvered summit slopes Of hope and faith, she will not turn to view; But towards the cave of heartbreak, harsh of hue, She goes, where all the dropsied horror ropes. There is a voice of waters in her ears, And on her brow a wind that never dies: One is the anguish of desired tears; One is the sorrow of unuttered sighs; And, burdened with the immemorial years, Downward she goes with never lifted eyes. QUATRAINS I Penury Above his misered embers, gaunt and gray, With toil-gnarled limbs he stoops: around his hut, Want, like a hobbling hag, goes, night and day, Trying the windows and the doors tight-shut. II Strategy Craft's silent sister and the daughter deep Of Contemplation, she, who spreads below A hostile tent soft comfort for her foe, With eyes of Jael watching till he sleep. III Tempest With helms of lightning, glittering in the skies, On steeds of thunder, form on cloudy form, Terrific beauty in their hair and eyes, Sweep down the wild Valkyries of the storm. IV The Locust Blossom The spirit Spring, in rainy raiment, met The spirit Summer for a moonlit hour: Sweet from their greeting kisses, warm and wet, Was born the fragrant beauty of this flower. V Melancholy With shadowy immortelles of memory About her brow, she sits with eyes that look Upon the stream of Lethe wearily, In hesitant hands Death's partly-opened book. VI Content Among the meadows of Life's sad uneaseâ In labor still renewing her soul's youthâ With trust, for patience, and with love, for peace, Singing she goes with the calm face of Ruth. VII Life and Death Of our own selves God makes a glass, wherein Two shades are imaged, passing like a breath: And one is Life, whose other name is Sin; And one is Love, whose other name is Death. VIII Sorrow Death takes her hand and leads her through the waste Of her own soul, wherein she hears the voice Of lost Love's tears, and, famishing, can but taste The dead-sea fruit of Life's remembered joys. A LAST WORD Not for myself, but for the sake of Song, Would I succeed as others have who gave Their lives unto her, shaping sure and strong Her lovely limbs that made them god and slave. Not for myself, but for the sake of Art, Would I advance beyond the others' best, Winning a deeper secret from her heart To hang it moonlike 'mid the starry rest. [WEEDS BY THE WALL] FOREWORD In the first rare Spring of song, In my heart's young hours, In my youth 't was thus I sang, Choosing 'mid the flowers:â âFair the Dandelion is, But for me too lowly; And the winsome Violet Is, forsooth, too holy. âBut the Touch-me-not?ââGo to! What! a face that 's speckled Like a common milking-maid's, Whom the sun hath freckled. Then the Wild-Rose is a flirt; And the Trillium-Lily, In her spotless gown, 's a prude, Sanctified and silly. By her cap the Columbine, To my mind, 's too merryâ Gossips, I would sooner woo Some plebeian Berry. And the shy Anemoneâ Well, her face shows sorrow; Pale, goodsooth! alive to-day, Dead and gone to-morrow. Then that bold-eyed, buxom wench, Big and blond and lazy,â She 's been chosen over oft!â Sirs, I mean the Daisy. Pleasant persons are they all, And their virtues many; Faith! I know but good of each, And naught ill of any. But I choose a May-Apple; She shall be my Lady; Blooming, hidden and refined, Sweet in places shady.â In my youth 't was thus I sang, In my heart's young hours, In the first rare Spring of song, Choosing 'mid the flowers. So I hesitated when Time alone was reckoned By the hours that Fancy smiled, Love and Beauty beckoned. Hard it was for me to choose From the flowers that flattered; And the blossom that I chose Soon lay dead and scattered. Hard I found it then, ah me! Hard I found the choosing; Harder, harder since I 've found, All too hard, the losing. Haply had I chosen then From the weeds that tangle Wayside, woodland, and the wall Of my garden's angle, I had chosen better, yea, For these later hoursâ Longer live the weeds, and oft Sweeter are than flowers. THE CRICKET I First of the insect choir, in the spring We hear his faint voice fluttering in the grass, Beneath some blossom's rosy covering, Or frond of fern, upon a wildwood pass. When in the marsh, in clamorous orchestras, The shrill hylodes pipe; when, in the haw's Bee-swarming blooms, or tasseling sassafras, Sweet threads of silvery song the sparrow draws, Bow-like, athwart the vibrant atmosphere,â Like some dim dream low-breathed in slumber's ear,â We hear his Cheer, cheer, cheer. II All summer long the mellowing meadows thrill To his blithe music. Be it day or night, Close gossip of the grass, on field and hill He serenades the silence with delight: Silence, that hears the melon slowly split With ripeness; and the plump peach, hornet-bit, Loosen and fall; and everywhere the white, Warm, silk-like stir of leafy lights that flit As breezes blow; above which, loudly clear,â Like joy who sings of life and has no fear,â We hear his Cheer, cheer, cheer. III Then in the autumn, by the waterside, Leaf-huddled; or along the weed-grown walks, He dirges low the flowers that have died, Or with their ghosts holds solitary talks. Lover of warmth, all day above the click And crunching of the sorghum-press, through thick Sweet steam of juice; all night when, white as chalk, The hunter's-moon hangs o'er the rustling rick, Within the barn 'mid munching cow and steer,â Soft as a memory the heart holds dear,â We hear his Cheer, cheer, cheer. IV Kinsman and cousin of the FaÃ«ry Race, All winter long he sets his sober mirth,â That brings good-luck to many a fireplace,â To folk-lore song and saga of the hearth. Between the back-log's bluster and the slim High twittering of the kettle,âsounds that hymn Home-comforts,âwhen, outside, the starless earth Is icicled in every laden limb,â Defying frost and all the sad and sere,â Like love that dies not and is always near,â We hear his Cheer, cheer, cheer. THE TREE TOAD I Secluded, solitary on some underbough Or cradled in a leaf, 'mid glimmering light, Like Puck thou crouchest: Haply watching how The slow toadstool comes bulging, moony white, Through loosening loam; or how, against the night, The glow-worm gathers silver to endow The darkness with; or how the dew conspires To hang at dusk with lamps of chilly fires Each blade that shrivels now. II O vague confederate of the whippoorwill, Of owl and cricket and the katydid! Thou gatherest up the silence in one shrill Vibrating note and send'st it where, half hid In cedars, twilight sleepsâeach azure lid Drooping a line of golden eyeball still.â Afar, yet near, I hear thy dewy voice Within the Garden of the Hours apoise On dusk's deep daffodil. III Minstrel of moisture! silent when high noon Shows her tanned face among the thirsting clover And parching meadows, thy tenebrious tune Wakes with the dew or when the rain is over. Thou troubadour of wetness and damp lover Of all cool things! admitted comrade boon Of twilight's hush, and little intimate Of eve's first fluttering star and delicate Round rim of rainy moon! IV Art trumpeter of Dwarfland? does thy horn Inform the gnomes and goblins of the hour When they may gambol under haw and thorn, Straddling each winking web and twinkling flower? Or bell-ringer of Elfland? whose tall tower The liriodendron is? from whence is borne The elfin music of thy bell's deep bass, To summon Fairies to their starlit maze, To summon them or warn. THE SCREECH-OWL I When, one by one, the stars have trembled through Eve's shadowy hues of violet, rose, and fireâ As on a pansy-bloom the limpid dew Orbs its bright beads;âand, one by one, the choir Of insects wakes on nodding bush and brier: Then through the woodsâwhere wandering winds pursue A ceaseless whisperâlike an eery lyre Struck in the Erl-king's halls, where ghosts and dreams Hold revelry, your goblin music screams, Shivering and strange as some strange thought come true. II Brown as the agaric that frills dead trees, Or those fantastic fungi of the woods That crowd the dampnessâare you kin to these In some mysterious way that still eludes My fancy? you, who haunt the solitudes With hag-like wailings? voice, that seems to freeze Out of the darkness,âlike the scent which broods, Rank and rain-sodden, over autumn nooks,â That, to the mind, might well suggest such looks, Ghastly and gray, as pale clairvoyance sees. III You people night with weirdness: lone and drear, Beneath the stars, you cry your wizard runes; And in the haggard silence, filled with fear, Your shuddering hoot seems some wild grief that croons Mockery and terror; or,âbeneath the moon's Cloud-hurrying glimmer,âto the startled ear, Crazed, madman snatches of old, perished tunes, The witless wit of outcast Edgar there In the wild night; or, wan with all despair, The mirthless laughter of the Fool in Lear. THE CHIPMUNK I He makes a roadway of the crumbling fence, Or on the fallen tree,âbrown as a leaf Fall stripes with russet,âgambols down the dense Green twilight of the woods. We see not whence He comes, nor whitherâ't is a time too brief!â He vanishes;âswift carrier of some Fay, Some pixy steed that haunts our child-beliefâ A goblin glimpse from woodland way to way. II What harlequin mood of nature qualified Him so with happiness? and limbed him with Such young activity as winds, that ride The ripples, have, that dance on every side? As sunbeams know, that urge the sap and pith Through hearts of trees? yet made him to delight, Gnome-like, in darkness,âlike a moonlight myth,â Lairing in labyrinths of the under night. III Here, by a rock, beneath the moss, a hole Leads to his home, the den wherein he sleeps; Lulled by near noises of the cautious mole Tunnelling its mineâlike some ungainly Troll Or by the tireless cricket there that keeps Picking its drowsy and monotonous lute; Or slower sounds of grass that creeps and creeps, And trees unrolling mighty root on root. IV Such is the music of his sleeping hours. Day hath anotherâ't is a melody He trips to, made by the assembled flowers, And light and fragrance laughing 'mid the bowers, And ripeness busy with the acorn-tree. Such strains, perhaps, as filled with mute amazeâ The silent music of Earth's ecstasyâ The Satyr's soul, the Faun of classic days. THE WILD IRIS That day we wandered 'mid the hills,âso lone Clouds are not lonelier,âthe forest lay In emerald darkness round us. Many a stone And gnarly root, gray-mossed, made wild our way: And many a bird the glimmering light along Showered the golden bubbles of its song. Then in the valley, where the brook went by, Silvering the ledges that it rippled from,â An isolated slip of fallen sky, Epitomizing heaven in its sum,â An iris bloomedâblue, as if, flower-disguised, The gaze of Spring had there materialized. I have forgotten many things since thenâ Much beauty and much happiness and grief; And toiled and dreamed among my fellowmen, Rejoicing in the knowledge life is brief. â'T is winter now,â so says each barren bough; And face and hair proclaim 't is winter now. I would forget the gladness of that spring! I would forget that day when she and I, Between the bird-song and the blossoming, Went hand in hand beneath the soft spring sky!â Much is forgotten, yeaâand yet, and yet, The things we would we never can forget.â Nor I how May then minted treasuries Of crowfoot gold; and molded out of light The sorrel's cups, whose elfin chalices Of limpid spar were streaked with rosy white. Nor all the stars of twinkling spiderwort, And mandrake moons with which her brows were girt. But most of all, yea, it were well for me, Me and my heart, that I forget that flower, The blue wild-iris, azure fleur-de-lis, That she and I together found that hour. Its recollection can but emphasize The pain of loss, remindful of her eyes. THE PATH BY THE CREEK There is a path that leads Through purple ironweeds, By button-bush and mallow Along a creek; A path that wildflowers hallow, That wild-birds seek; Roofed thick with eglantine And grape and trumpet-vine. This side, the blackberries sweet Glow cobalt in the heat; That side, a creamy yellow, In summer-time The pawpaws slowly mellow: And autumn's prime Strews red the Chickasaw, Persimmon brown and haw. The glittering dragon-fly, A wingÃ©d gem, goes by; And tawny wasp and hornet Make drowsy drone; The beetle, like a garnet, Basks on the stone; And butterflies float there, Spangling with gold the air. Here the brown thrashers hide, And chat and cat-bird chide; The blue kingfisher houses Above the stream, And here the heron drowses, Lost in his dream; The vireo's flitting note Makes woodlands more remote. And now a cow's slow bell Tinkles from dale to dell; Where breeze-dropped petals winnow From blossomy limbs On waters, where the minnow, Faint-twinkling, swims; Where, in the root-arched shade, Slim prisms of light are laid. When in the tangled thorn The new-moon hangs a horn, Or, 'mid the sunset's islands, Guides her canoe, The brown owl in the silence Calls, and the dew Beads glimmering orbs of damp, Each one a glow-worm lamp. Then when the night is still Here sings the whippoorwill; And stealthy sounds of crickets, And winds that pass, Whispering, through bramble thickets Along the grass, Faint with warm scents of hay, Seem feet of dreams astray. And where the water shines Dark through tree-twisted vines, Some water-spirit, dreaming, Braids in her hair A star's reflection; seeming A jewel there; While all the sweet night long Ripples her quiet song. . . . Would I could imitate, O path, thy happy state! Making my life all beauty, All bloom and beam; Knowing no other duty But just to dream, And far from pain and woe Lead feet that come and go. Leading to calm content, O'er ways the Master went, Through lowly things and humble, To peace and love; Teaching the lives that stumble To look above, Forget the world of toil And all its mad turmoil. ALONG THE STREAM Where the violet shadows brood Under cottonwoods and beeches, Through whose leaves the restless reaches Of the river glance, I 've stood, While the red-bird and the thrush Set to song the morning hush. There,âwhen wakening woods encroach On the shadowy winding waters, And the bluets, April's daughters, At the darling Spring's approach, Star their myriads through the trees,â All the land is one with peace. Under some imposing cliff, That, with bush and tree and boulder, Thrusts a gray, gigantic shoulder O'er the stream, I 've oared a skiff, While great clouds of iceberg hue Lounged along the noonday blue. There,âwhen harvest heights impend Over shores of rippling summer, And to greet the fair new-comer,â June,âthe wildrose thickets bend In a million blossoms dressed,â All the land is one with rest. On some rock, where gaunt the oak Reddens and the sombre cedar Darkens, like a sachem leader, I have lain and watched the smoke Of the steamboat, far-away, Trailed along the dying day. There,âwhen margin waves reflect Autumn colors, gay and sober, And the Indian-girl, October, Wampum-like in berries decked, Leans above the leaf-strewn streams,â All the land is one with dreams. Through the bottoms where,âout-tossed By the wind's wild hands,âashiver Bend the willows o'er the river, I have walked in sleet and frost, While beneath the cold round moon, Frozen, gleamed the long lagoon. There,âwhen leafless woods uplift Spectral arms the storm-blasts splinter, And the hoary trapper, Winter, Builds his camp of ice and drift, With his snow-pelts furred and shod,â All the land is one with God. VOICES When blood-root blooms and trillium flowers Unclasp their stars to sun and rain, My heart strikes hands with winds and showers And wanders in the woods again. O urging impulse, born of spring! That makes glad April of my soul, No bird, however wild of wing, Is more impatient of control. Impetuous of pulse it beats Within my blood and bears me hence; Above the housetops and the streets I hear its happy eloquence. It tells me all that I would know, Of birds and buds, of blooms and bees; I seem to hear the blossoms blow, And leaves unfolding on the trees. I seem to hear the bluebells ring Faint purple peals of perfume; and The honey-throated poppies fling Their golden laughter o'er the land. It calls to me; it sings to me; I hear its far voice night and day; I can not choose but go when tree And flower clamor, âCome away!â THE ROAD HOME Over the hills as the pewee flies, Under the blue of the southern skies; Over the hills where the red-bird wings, Like a scarlet blossom, or sits and sings: Under the shadow of rock and tree, Where the warm wind drones with the honey-bee; And the tall wild-carrots around you sway Their lace-like flowers of cloudy gray: By the black-cohosh and its pearl-white plume A-nod in the woodland's odorous gloom; By the old rail-fence, in the elder's shade, That the myriad hosts of the weeds invade: Where the butterfly-weed, like a coal of fire, Blurs orange-red through brush and brier; Where the pennyroyal and mint smell sweet, And blackberries tangle the humming heat, The old road leads; then crosses the creek, Where the minnow dartles, a silvery streak; Where the cows wade deep through the blue-eyed grass, And the flickering dragon-flies gleaming pass. That road is easy, however long, Which wends with beauty as toil with song; And the road we follow shall lead us straight Past creek and wood to a farm-house gate. Past hill and hollow, whence scents are blown Of dew-wet clover that scythes have mown; To a house that stands with porches wide And gray low roof on the green hill-side. Colonial, stately; 'mid shade and shine Of the locust tree and the southern pine; With its orchard acres and meadowlands Stretched out before it like welcoming hands. And gardens, where, in the myrrh-sweet June, Magnolias blossom with many a moon Of fragrance; and, in the feldspar light Of August, roses bloom red and white. In a woodbine arbor, a perfumed place, A slim girl sits with listening face; Her bonnet by her, a sunbeam lies On her lovely hair, in her earnest eyes. Her eyes, as blue as the distant deeps Of the heavens above where the high hawk sleeps; A book beside her, wherein she read Till she saw him coming, she heard his tread. Come home at last; come back from the war; In his eyes a smile, on his brow a scar: To the South come backâwho wakes from her dream To the love and the peace of a new regime. DROUTH I The hot sunflowers by the glaring pike Lift shields of sultry brass; the teasel tops, Pink-thorned, advance with bristling spike on spike Against the furious sunlight. Field and copse Are sick with summer: now, with breathless stops, The locusts cymbal; now grasshoppers beat Their castanets: and rolled in dust, a team,â Like some mean life wrapped in its sorry dream,â An empty wagon rattles through the heat. II Where now the blue, blue flags? the flow'rs whose mouths Are moist and musky? Where the sweet-breathed mint, That made the brook-bank herby? Where the South's Wild morning-glories, rich in hues, that hint At coming showers that the rainbows tint? Where all the blossoms that the wildwood knows? The frail oxalis hidden in its leaves; The Indian-pipe, pale as a soul that grieves; The freckled touch-me-not and forest rose. III Dead! dead! all dead beside the drouth-burnt brook, Shrouded in moss or in the shriveled grass. Where waved their bells,âfrom which the wild-bee shook The dew-drop once,âgaunt, in a nightmare mass, The rank weeds crowd; through which the cattle pass, Thirsty and lean, seeking some meagre spring, Closed in with thorns, on which stray bits of wool The panting sheep have left, that sought the cool, From morn till evening wearily wandering. IV No bird is heard; no throat to whistle awake The sleepy hush; to let its music leak Fresh, bubble-like, through bloom-roofs of the brake: Only the green-blue heron, famine-weak,â Searching the stale pools of the minnowless creek,â Utters its call; and then the rain-crow, too, False prophet now, croaks to the stagnant air; While overhead,âstill as if painted there,â A buzzard hangs, black on the burning blue. THE BROKEN DROUTH It seemed the listening forest held its breath Before some vague and unapparent form Of fear, approaching with the wings of death, On the impending storm. Above the hills, big, bellying clouds loomed, black And ominous; yet silent as the blue That pools calm heights of heaven, deepening back 'Twixt clouds of snowdrift hue. Then instantly, as when a multitude Shout riot and war through some tumultous town, Innumerable voices swept the wood As wild the wind rushed down. And fierce and few, as when a strong man weeps, Great rain-drops dashed the dust; and, overhead, Ponderous and vast down the prodigious deeps, Went slow the thunder's tread. And swift and furious, as when giants fence, The lightning foils of tempest went insane; Then far and near sonorous Earth grew dense With long sweet sweep of rain. FEUD A mile of lane,âhedged high with ironweeds And dying daisies,âwhite with sun, that leads Downward into a wood; through which a stream Steals like a shadow; over which is laid A bridge of logs, worn deep with many a team, Sunk in the tangled shade. Far off a wood-dove lifts its lonely cry; And in the sleepy silver of the sky A gray hawk wheels scarce larger than a hand.â From point to point the road grows worse and worse, Until that place is reached where all the land Seems burdened with some curse. A ragged fence of pickets, warped and sprung,â On which the fragments of a gate are hung,â Divides a hill, the fox and ground-hog haunt, A wilderness of briers; o'er whose tops A battered barn is seen, low-roofed and gaunt, 'Mid fields that know no crops. Fields over which a path, o'erwhelmed with burrs And ragweeds, noisy with the grasshoppers, Leads,âlost, irresolute as paths the cows Wear through the woods,âunto a woodshed; then, With wrecks of windows, to a huddled house, Where men have murdered men. A house, whose tottering chimney, clay and rock, Is seamed and crannied; whose lame door and lock Are bullet-bored; around which, there and here, Are sinister stains.âOne dreads to look around.â The place seems thinking of that time of fear And dares not breathe a sound. Within, is emptiness: the sunlight falls On faded journals papering its walls; On advertisement chromos, torn with time Around a hearth where wasps and spiders build.â The house is dead: meseems that night of crime It, too, was shot and killed. UNANOINTED I Upon the Siren-haunted seas, between Fate's mythic shores, Within a world of moon and mist, where dusk and daylight wed, I see a phantom galley and its hull is banked with oars, With ghostly oars that move to song, a song of dreams long dead:â âOh, we are sick of rowing here! With toil our arms are numb; With smiting year on weary year Salt-furrows of the foam: Our journey's end is never near, And will no nearer comeâ Beyond our reach the shores appear Of far Elysium.â II Within a land of cataracts and mountains old, and sand, Beneath whose heavens ruins rise, o'er which the stars burn red, I see a spectral cavalcade with crucifix in hand And shadowy armor march and sing, a song of dreams long dead:â âOh, we are weary marching on! Our limbs are travel-worn; With cross and sword from dawn to dawn We wend with raiment torn: The leagues to go, the leagues we 've gone Are sand and rock and thornâ The way is long to Avalon Beyond the deeps of morn.â III They are the curs'd! the souls who yearn and evermore pursue The vision of a vain desire, a splendor far ahead; To whom God gives the poet's dream without the grasp to do, The artist's hope without the scope between the quick and dead:â I, too, am weary toiling where The winds and waters beat; When shall I ease the oar I bear And rest my tired feet? When will the white moons cease to glare, The red suns veil their heat? And from the heights blow sweet the air Of Love's divine retreat? SUNSET AND STORM Deep with divine tautology, The sunset's mighty mystery Again has traced the scroll-like west With hieroglyphs of burning gold: Forever new, forever old, Its miracle is manifest. Time lays the scroll away. And now Above the hills a giant brow Night lifts of cloud; and from her arm, Barbaric black, upon the world, With thunder, wind and fire, is hurled Her awful argument of storm. What part, O man, is yours in such? Whose awe and wonder are in touch With Nature,âspeaking rapture to Your soul,âyet leaving in your reach No human word of thought or speech Expressive of the thing you view. BEECH BLOOMS Among the valleys The wild oxalis Lifts up its chalice Of pink and pearl; And, balsam-breathing From out their sheathing, The myriad wreathing Green leaves uncurl. The whole world brightens With spring, that lightens The foot that frightens The building thrush; Where water tosses On ferns and mosses The squirrel crosses The beechen hush. And vision on vision,â Like ships elysian On some white mission,â Sails cloud on cloud; With scents of clover The winds brim over, And in the cover The stream is loud. 'Twixt bloom that blanches The orchard branches Old farms and ranches Gleam in the gloam: Through fields for sowing, 'Mid blossoms blowing, The cows come lowing, The cows come home. Where ways are narrow, A vesper-sparrow Flits like an arrow Of living rhyme; The red sun poises, And farm-yard noises Mix with glad voices Of milking-time. When dusk disposes Of all its roses, And darkness closes, And work is done, A moon's white feather In starry weather And two together Whose hearts are one. WORSHIP I The mornings raise Voices of gold in the Almighty's praise; The sunsets soar In choral crimson from far shore to shore: Each is a blast, Reverberant, of color,âseen as vast Concussions,âthat the vocal firmament In worship sounds o'er every continent. II Not for our ears The cosmic music of the rolling spheres, That sweeps the skies! Music we hear, but only with our eyes. For all too weak Our mortal frames to bear the words these speak, Those detonations that we name the dawn And sunsetâhues Earth's harmony puts on. UNHEARD All things are wrought of melody, Unheard, yet full of speaking spells; Within the rock, within the tree, A soul of music dwells. A mute symphonic sense that thrills The silent frame of mortal things; Its heart beats in the ancient hills, And in each flow'r sings. To harmony all growth is setâ Each seed is but a music mote, From which each plant, each violet, Evolves its purple note. Compact of melody, the rose Woos the soft wind with strain on strain Of crimson; and the lily blows Its white bars to the rain. The trees are pÃ¦ans; and the grass One long green fugue beneath the sunâ Song is their life; and all shall pass, Shall end, when song is done. REINCARNATION High in the place of outraged Liberty, He ruled the world, an emperor and god: His iron armies swept the land and sea, And conquered nations trembled at his nod. By him the love that fills man's soul with light, And makes a heaven of earth, was crucified; Lust-crowned he lived, yea, lived in God's despite, And old in infamies, a king he died. Justice begins now.âMany centuries In some vile body must his soul atone As slave, as beggar, loathsome with disease, Less than the dog at which we fling a stone. ON CHENOWETH'S RUN I thought of the road through the glen, With its hawk's nest high in the pine; With its rock, where the fox had his den, 'Mid tangles of sumach and vine, Where she swore to be mine. I thought of the creek and its banks, Now glooming, now gleaming with sun; The rustic bridge builded of planks, The bridge over Chenoweth's Run, Where I wooed her and won. I thought of the house in the lane, With its pinks and its sweet mignonette; Its fence, and the gate with its chain, Its porch where the roses hung wet, Where I kissed her and met. Then I thought of the family graves, Walled rudely with stone, in the West, Where the sorrowful cedar-tree waves, And the wind is a spirit distressed, Where they laid her to rest. And my soul, overwhelmed with despair, Cried out on the city and mart!â How I longed, how I longed to be there, Away from the struggle and smart, By her and my heart. By her and my heart in the West,â Laid sadly together as one;â On her grave for a moment to rest, Far away from the noise and the sun, On Chenoweth's Run. REQUIESCAT The roses mourn for her who sleeps Within the tomb; For her each lily-flower weeps Dew and perfume. In each neglected flower-bed Each blossom droops its lovely head,â They miss her touch, they miss her tread, Her face of bloom, Of happy bloom. The very breezes grieve for her, A lonely grief; For her each tree is sorrower, Each blade and leaf. The foliage rocks itself and sighs, And to its woe the wind replies,â They miss her girlish laugh and cries, Whose life was brief, Was all too brief. The sunlight, too, seems pale with care, Or sick with woe; The memory haunts it of her hair, Its golden glow. No more within the bramble-brake The sleepy bloom is kissed awakeâ The sun is sad for her dear sake, Whose head lies low, Lies dim and low. The bird, that sang so sweet, is still At dusk and dawn; No more it makes the silence thrill Of wood and lawn. In vain the buds, when it is near, Open each pink and perfumed ear,â The song it sings she will not hear Who now is gone, Is dead and gone. Ah, well she sleeps who loved them well, The birds and bowers; The fair, the young, the lovable, Who once was ours. Alas! that loveliness must pass! Must come to lie beneath the grass! That youth and joy must fade, alas! And die like flowers, Earth's sweetest flowers! THE QUEST I First I asked the honey-bee, Busy in the balmy bowers; Saying, âSweetheart, tell it me: Have you seen her, honey-bee? She is cousin to the flowersâ All the sweetness of the south In her wild-rose face and mouth.ââ But the bee passed silently. II Then I asked the forest-bird, Warbling by the woodland waters; Saying, âDearest, have you heard, Have you heard her, forest-bird? She is one of Music's daughtersâ Never song so sweet by half As the music of her laugh.ââ But the bird said not a word. III Next I asked the evening-sky, Hanging out its lamps of fire; Saying, âLoved one, passed she by? Tell me, tell me, evening-sky! She, the star of my desireâ Sister whom the Pleiads lost, And my soul's high pentecost.ââ But the sky made no reply. IV Where is she? ah, where is she? She to whom both love and duty Bind me, yea, immortally.â Where is she? ah, where is she? Symbol of the Earth-soul's beauty. I have lost her. Help my heart Find her! her, who is a part Of the pagan soul of me! BEFORE THE RAIN Before the rain, low in the obscure east, Weak and morose the moon hung, sickly gray; Around its disc the storm mists, cracked and creased, Wove an enormous web, wherein it lay Like some white spider hungry for its prey. Vindictive looked the scowling firmament, In which each star, that flashed a dagger ray, Seemed filled with malice of some dark intent. The marsh-frog croaked; and underneath the stone The peevish cricket raised a creaking cry. Within the world these sounds were heard alone, Save when the ruffian wind swept from the sky, Making each tree like some sad spirit sigh; Or shook the clumsy beetle from its weed, That, in the drowsy darkness, bungling by, Sharded the silence with its feverish speed. Slowly the tempest gathered. Hours passed Before was heard the thunder's sullen drum Rumbling night's hollow; and the Earth at last, Restless with waiting,âlike a woman, dumb With doubting of the love that should have clomb Her casement hours ago,âavowed again, 'Mid protestations, joy that he had come. And all night long I heard the Heavens explain. AFTER RAIN Behold the blossom-bosomed Day again, With all the star-white Hours in her train, Laughs out of pearl-lights through a golden ray, That, leaning on the woodland wildness, blends A sprinkled amber with the showers that lay Their oblong emeralds on the leafy ends. Behold her bend with maiden-braided brows Above the wildflower, sidewise with its strain Of dewy happiness, to kiss again Each drop to death; or, under rainy boughs, With fingers, fragrant as the woodland rain, Gather the sparkles from the sycamore, To set within the core Of crimson roses girdling her hips, Where each bud dreams and drips. Smoothing her blue-black hair,âwhere many a tusk Of iris flashes,âlike the falchions keen Of Faery round blue banners of their Queen,â Is it a Naiad singing in the dusk, That haunts the spring where all the moss is musk With footsteps of the flowers on the banks? Or but a wild-bird voluble with thanks? Balm for each blade of grass: the Hours prepare A festival each weed 's invited to. Each bee is drunken with the honied air: And all the heaven is eloquent with blue. The wet hay glitters, and the harvester Tinkles his scythe,âas twinkling as the dew,â That shall not spare Blossom or brier in its sweeping path; And, ere it cut one swath, Rings them they die, and tells them to prepare. What is the spice that haunts each glen and glade? A Dryad's lips, who slumbers in the shade? A Faun, who lets the heavy ivy-wreath Slip to his thigh as, reaching up, he pulls The chestnut blossoms in whole bosomfuls? A sylvan Spirit, whose sweet mouth doth breathe Her viewless presence near us, unafraid? Or troops of ghosts of blooms, that whitely wade The brook? whose wisdom knows no other song But that the bird sings where it builds beneath The wild-rose and sits singing all day long. Oh, let me sit with silence for a space, A little while forgetting that fierce part Of man that struggles in the toiling mart; Where God can look into my heart's own heart From unsoiled heights made amiable with grace; And where the sermons that the old oaks keep Can steal into me.âAnd what better then Than, turning to the moss a quiet face, To fall asleep? a little while to sleep And dream of wiser worlds and wiser men. SUNSET CLOUDS Low clouds, the lightning veins and cleaves, Torn from the wilderness of storm, Sweep westward like enormous leaves O'er field and farm. And in the west, on burning skies, Their wrath is quenched, their hate is hushed, And deep their drifted thunder lies With splendor flushed. The black turns gray, the gray turns gold; And sea'd in deeps of radiant rose, Summits of fire, manifold, They now repose. What dreams they bring! what thoughts reveal! That have their source in loveliness, Through which the doubts I often feel Grow less and less. Through which I see that other night, That cloud called Death, transformed of Love To flame, and pointing with its light To life above. RICHES What mines the morning heavens unfold! What far Alaskas of the skies! That, veined with elemental gold, Sierra on Sierra rise. Heap up the gold of all the world, The ore that makes men fools and slaves: What is it to the gold, cloud-curled, That rivers through the sunset's caves. Search Earth for riches all who will, The gold that soils, that turns to dustâ Mine be the wealth no thief can steal, The gold of Beauty naught can rust. THE AGE OF GOLD The clouds that tower in storm, that beat Arterial thunder in their veins; The wildflowers lifting, shyly sweet, Their perfect faces from the plains,â All high, all lowly things of Earth For no vague end have had their birth. Low strips of mist, that mesh the moon Above the foaming waterfall; And mountains that God's hand hath hewn, And forests where the great winds call,â Within the grasp of such as see Are parts of a conspiracy; To seize the soul with beauty; hold The heart with love: and thus fulfill Within ourselves the Age of Gold, That never died, and never will,â As long as one true nature feels The wonders that the world reveals. A SONG FOR LABOR I Oh, the morning meads, the dewy meads, Where he ploughs and harrows and sows the seeds, Singing a song of manly deeds, In the blossoming springtime weather: The heart in his bosom as high as the word Said to the sky by the mating bird, While the beat of an answering heart is heard, His heart and hers together. II Oh, the noonday heights, the sunlit heights, Where he stoops to the harvest his keen scythe smites, Singing a song of the work that requites, In the ripening summer weather: The soul in his body as light as the sigh Of the little cloud-breeze that cools the sky, While he hears an answering soul reply, His soul and hers together. III Oh, the evening vales, the twilight vales, Where he labors and sweats to the thud of flails, Singing a song of the toil that he hails, In the fruitful autumn weather: In heart and in soul as free from fears As the first white star in the sky that appears, While the music of life and of love he hears, Her life and his together. THE LOVE OF LOVES I have not seen her face, and yet She is more sweet than anything Of earthâthan rose or violet That winds of May and sunbeams bring. Of all we know, past or to come, That beauty holds within its net, She is the high compendium: And yetâ I have not touched her robe, and still She is more dear than lyric words And music; or than strains that fill The throbbing throats of forest birds. Of all we mean by poetry, That rules the soul and charms the will, She is the deep epitome: And stillâ She is my world: ah, pity me! A dream that flies whom I pursue: Whom all pursue, whoe'er they be, Who toil for Art and dare and do. The shadow-love for whom they sigh, The far ideal affinity, For whom they live and gladly dieâ Ah me! THREE THINGS There are three things of Earth That help us more Than those of heavenly birth That all imploreâ Than Love or Faith or Hope, For which we strive and grope. The first one is Desire,â Who takes our hand And fills our hearts with fire None may withstand;â Through whom we 're lifted far Above both moon and star. The second one is Dream,â Who leads our feet By an immortal gleam To visions sweet;â Through whom our forms put on Dim attributes of dawn. The last of these is Toil,â Who maketh true, Within the world's turmoil The other two;â Through whom we may behold Ourselves with kings enrolled. IMMORTELLES I As some warm moment of repose In one rich rose Sums all the summer's lovely bloom And pure perfumeâ So did her soul epitomize All hopes that make life wise, Who lies before us now with lidded eyes, Faith's amaranth of truth Crowning her youth. II As some melodious note or strain May so contain All of sweet music in one chord, Or lyric wordâ So did her loving heart suggest All dreams that make life blessed, Who lies before us now with pulseless breast, Love's asphodel of duty Crowning her beauty. A LULLABY I In her wimple of wind and her slippers of sleep The twilight comes like a little goose-girl, Herding her owls with many âTu-whoos,â Her little brown owls in the forest deep, Where dimly she walks in her whispering shoes, And gown of glimmering pearl. Sleep, sleep, little one, sleep: This is the road to Rockaby Town. Rockaby, lullaby, where dreams are cheap; Here you can buy any dream for a crown. Sleep, sleep, little one, sleep; The cradle you lie in is soft and is deep, The wagon that takes you to Rockaby Town. Now you go up, sweet, now you go down, Rockaby, lullaby, now you go down. II And after the twilight comes midnight, who wears A mantle of purple so old, so old! Who stables the lily-white moon, it is said, In a wonderful chamber with violet stairs, Up which you can see her come, silent of tread, On hoofs of pale silver and gold. Dream, dream, little one, dream: This is the way to Lullaby Land. Lullaby, rockaby, where, white as cream, Sugar-plum bowers drop sweets in your hand. Dream, dream, little one, dream; The cradle you lie in is tight at each seam, The boat that goes sailing to Lullaby Land. Over the sea, sweet, over the sand, Lullaby, rockaby, over the sand. III The twilight and midnight are lovers, you know, And each to the other is true, is true! And there on the moon through the heavens they ride, With the little brown owls all huddled a-row, Through meadows of heaven where, every side, Blossom the stars and the dew. Rest, rest, little one, rest: Rockaby Town is in Lullaby Isle. Rockaby, lullaby, set like a nest Deep in the heart of a song and a smile. Rest, rest, little one, rest; The cradle you lie in is warm as my breast, The white bird that bears you to Lullaby Isle. Out of the East, sweet, into the West, Rockaby, lullaby, into the West. PESTILENCE High on a throne of noisome ooze and heat, 'Mid rotting trees of bayou and lagoon, Ghastly she sits beneath the skeleton moon, A tawny horror coiling at her feetâ Fever, whose eyes keep watching, serpent-like, Until her eyes shall bid him rise and strike. MUSINGS I Inspiration All who have toiled for Art, who've won or lost, Sat equal priests at her high Pentecost; Only the chrism and sacrament of flame, Anointing all, inspired not all the same. II Apportionment How often in our search for joy below Hoping for happiness we chance on woe. III Victory They who take courage from their own defeat Are victors too, no matter how much beat. IV Preparation How often hope's fair flower blooms richest where The soul was fertilized with black despair. V Disillusion Those unrequited in their love who die Have never drained life's chief illusion dry. VI Success Success allures us in the earth and skies: We seek to win her, but, too amorous, Mocking, she flees us.âHaply, were we wise, We should not strive and she would come to us. VII Science Miranda-like, above the world she waves The wand of Prospero; and, beautiful, Ariel the airy, Caliban the dull,â Lightning and Steam,âare her unwilling slaves. VIII The Universal Wind Wild son of Heav'n, with laughter and alarm, Now east, now west, now north, now south he goes, Bearing in one harsh hand dark death and storm, And in the other, sunshine and a rose. IX Compensation Yea, whom He loves the Lord God chasteneth With disappointments, so that this side death, Through suffering and failure, they know Hell To make them worthy in that Heaven to dwell Of Love's attainment, where they come to be Parts of its beauty and divinity. X Poppies Summer met Sleep at sunset, Dreaming within the south,â Drugged with his soul's deep slumber, Red with her heart's hot drouth, These are the drowsy kisses She pressed upon his mouth. XI Her Eyes and Mouth There is no Paradise like that which lies Deep in the heavens of her azure eyes: There is no Eden here on Earth that glows Like that which smiles rich in her mouth's red rose. XII Her Soul To me not only does her soul suggest Palms and the peace of tropic shore and wood, But, oceaned far beyond the golden West, The Fortunate Islands of true Womanhood. XIII Her Face The gladness of our Southern spring; the grace Of summer; and the dreaminess of fall Are parts of her sweet nature.âSuch a face Was Ruth's, methinks, divinely spiritual. THE MESSAGE OF THE LILIES My soul and I went walking Beneath the moon of spring; The lilies pale were talking, We heard them murmuring. From dimly moonlit places They thrust long throats of white, And lifted fairy faces Of fragrant snow and light. Their language was an essence, Yet clear as any bird's; And from it grew a presence, As music grows from words. A spirit born of silence And chastity and dew Among Elysian islands Were not more white to view. A spirit born of fire And holiness and snow, Within the Heaven's desire, Were not more pure to know. He smiled among them, lifting Pale hands of prayer and peaceâ And through the moonlight, drifting, Came words to me like these:â âWe are His lilies, lilies, Whose praises here we sing! We are the lilies, lilies Of Christ our Lord and King!â ANTHEM OF DAWN I Then up the orient heights to the zenith that balanced the crescent,â Up and far up and over,âthe heaven grew erubescent, Vibrant with rose and with ruby from hands of the harpist Dawn, Smiting symphonic fire on the firmament's barbiton; And the East was a priest who adored with offerings of gold and of gems, And a wonderful carpet unrolled for the inaccessible hems Of the glittering robes of her limbs; that, lily and amethyst, Swept glorying on and on through temples of cloud and mist. II Then out of the splendor and richness, that burned like a magic stone, The torrent suffusion that deepened and dazzled and broadened and shone, The pomp and the pageant of color, triumphal procession of glare, The sun, like a king in armor, breathing splendor from feet to hair, Stood forth with majesty girdled, as a hero who towers afar Where the bannered gates are bristling hells and the walls are roaring war: And broad on the back of the world, like a Cherubin's fiery blade, The effulgent gaze of his aspect fell in glittering accolade. III Then billowing blue, like an ocean, rolled from the shores of dawn to even: And the stars like rafts went down; and the moon, like a ghost-ship driven, A feather of foam, from port to port to port of the cloud-built isles that dotted, With pearl and cameo, bays of the day,âher canvas webbed and rotted,â Lay lost in the gulf of heaven; while over her mixed and melted The beautiful children of Morn, whose bodies are opal-belted; The beautiful daughters of Dawn, who, over and under and after The rivered radiance wrestled; and rainbowed heaven with laughter Of halcyon sapphire.âO Dawn! thou visible mirth, Thou hallelujah of heaven! hosanna of Earth! AT THE LANE'S END I No more to strip the roses from The rose-sprays of her porch's place!â I dreamed last night that I was home Kissing a roseâher face. I must have smiled in sleepâwho knows?â The rose-aroma filled the lane; I saw her white hand's lifted rose That welcomed home again. And yet when I awokeâso wan, My old face wet with icy tearsâ Somehow, it seems, she was not gone, Though dead now thirty years. II The clouds roll up and the clouds roll down Over the roofs of the little town; Out in the hills, where the pike winds by Fields of clover and bottoms of rye, You will hear no sound but the barking cough Of the striped chipmunk where the lane leads off; You will hear no bird but the sapsuckÃ©r Far off in the forest,âthat seems to purr, As the warm wind fondles its top, grown hot, Like the docile back of an ocelot: You will see no thing but the shine and shade Of briers that climb and of weeds that wade The glittering creeks of the heat, that fills The dusty road and the red-keel hills.â And all day long in the pennyroyal The grasshoppers at their anvils toil; Thick click of their tireless hammers thrum, And the wheezy belts of their bellows hum; Tinkers who solder the silence and heat To make the loneliness more complete. Around old rails where the blackberries Are reddening ripe, and the bumblebees Are a drowsy rustle of Summer's skirts, And the bob-white's wing is the fan she flirts; Under the hill, through the ironweeds And ox-eyed daisies and milkweeds, leads The path forgotten of all but one. Where elder-bushes are sick with sun, And wild raspberries branch big, blue veins O'er the face of the rock where the old spring rains Its sparkling splinters of molten spar On the gravel bed where the tadpoles are,â You will find the pales of a fallen fence, And the tangled orchard and vineyard, dense With the weedy neglect of thirty years. The garden there,âwhere the soft sky clears Like an old sweet face that has dried its tears;â The garden-plot where the cabbage grew And the pompous pumpkin; and beans that blew Balloons of white by the melon patch; Maize; and tomatoes that seemed to catch Oblong amber and agate balls Globed of the sun in the frosty falls: Long rows of currants and gooseberries, And the balsam-gourd with its honey-bees. And here was a nook for the princess-plumes, The snapdragons and the poppy-blooms, Quaint sweet-williams and pansy-flowers, And the morning-glories' bewildered bowers, Tipping their cornucopias up For the humming-birds that came to sup. And over it all was the Sabbath peace Of the land whose lap was the love of these; And the old log-house where my innocence died, With my boyhood buried side by side. Shall a man with a face as withered and gray As the wasp-nest stowed in a loft away,â Where the hornets haunt and the mortar drops From the loosened logs of the clapboard tops;â Whom vice has aged as the rotting rooms The rain where memories haunt the glooms; A hitch in his joints like the rheum that gnars In the rasping hinge of the door that jars; A harsh, cracked throat like the old stone flue Where the swallows build the summer through;â Shall a man, I say, with the spider sins That the long years spin in the outs and ins Of his soul, returning to see once more His boyhood's home, where his life was poor With toil and tears and their fretfulness, But rich with health and the hopes that bless The unsoiled wealth of a vigorous youth; Shall he not take comfort and know the truth In its threadbare raiment of falsehood?âYea! In his crumbled past he shall kneel and pray, Like a pilgrim come to the shrine again Of the homely saints that shall soothe his pain, And arise and depart made clean again! III Years of care can not efface Visions of the hills and trees Closing in its dam and race; Nor the mile-long memories Of the mill-stream's lovely place. How the sunsets used to stain Mirrors of the waters lying Under eaves made dark with rain! Where the red-bird, westward flying, Lit to try its song again. Dingles, hills and woods, and springs, Where we came in calm and storm, Swinging in the grapevine swings, Wading where the rocks were warm, With our fishing-nets and strings. Here the road plunged down the hill, Under ash and chinquapin,â Where the grasshoppers would drill Ears of silence with their din,â To the willow-girdled mill. There the path beyond the ford Takes the woodside; just below Shallows that the lilies sword, Where the scarlet blossoms blow Of the trumpet-vine and gourd. Summer winds, that sink with heat, On the pelted waters winnow Moony petals that repeat Crescents, where the startled minnow Beats a glittering retreat. Summer winds that bear the scent Of the ironweed and mint, Weary with sweet freight and spent, On the deeper pools imprint Stumbling steps, whose ripples dent. Summer winds, that split the husk Of the peach and nectarine, Trail along the amber dusk Hazy skirts of gold and green, Spilling balms of dew and musk. Where with balls of bursting juice Summer sees the red wild-plum Strew the gravel; ripened loose, Autumn hears the pawpaw drum Plumpness on the rocks that bruise: There we found the water-beech, One forgotten August noon, With a hornet-nest in reach,â Like a fairyland balloon, Full of bustling fairy speech. Some invasion, sure, it was; For we heard the captains scold; Waspish cavalry a-buzz,â Troopers uniformed in gold, Sable-slashed,âto charge on us. Could I find the sedgy angle, Where the dragon-flies would turn Slender flittings into spangle On the sunlight? or would burnâ Where the berries made a tangleâ Sparkling green and brassy blue; Rendezvousing, by the stream, Bands of elf-banditti, who, Brigands of the bloom and beam, Drunken were with honey-dew. Could I find the pond that lay Where vermilion blossoms showered Fragrance down the daisied way? That the sassafras embowered With the spice of early May? Could I find itâshould I seekâ The old mill? Its weather-beaten Wheel and gable by the creek? With its warping roof; worm-eaten, Dusty rafters worn and weak. Where old shadows haunt old places, Loft and hopper, stair and bin; Ghostly with the dust that laces Webs that usher phantoms in, Wistful with remembered faces. While the frogs' grave litanies Drowse in far-off antiphone, Supplicating, till the eyes Of dead friendships, long alone In the dusky corners,ârise. Moonbeams? or the twinkling tip Of a star? or, in the darkling Twilight, fireflies? there that dipâ As if Night a myriad sparkling Jewels from her hands let slip. Where, I dream, my youth still crosses, With a corn-sack for the meal, Through the sprinkled ferns and mosses, To the gray mill's lichened wheel, Where the water drips and tosses. ENCHANTMENT The deep seclusion of this forest path,â O'er which the green boughs weave a canopy; Along which bluet and anemone Spread a dim carpet; where the Twilight hath Her dark abode; and, sweet as aftermath, Wood-fragrance roams,âhas so enchanted me, That yonder blossoming bramble seems to be Some Sylvan resting, rosy from her bath: Has so enspelled me with tradition's dreams, That every foam-white stream that, twinkling, flows, And every bird that flutters wings of tan, Or warbles hidden, to my fancy seems A Naiad dancing to a Faun who blows Wild woodland music on the pipes of Pan. IN THE FOREST One well might deem, among these miles of woods, Such were the Forests of the Holy Grail,â BrocÃ©liand and Dean: where, clothed in mail, The Knights of Arthur rode, and all the broods Of legend laired.âAnd, where no sound intrudes Upon the ear, except the glimmering wail Of some far bird; or, in some flowery swale, A brook that murmurs to the solitudes, Might think he hears the laugh of Vivien Blent with the moan of Merlin, muttering bound By his own magic to one stony spot: And, in the cloud that looms above the glen,â In which the sun burns like the Table Round,â Might dream he sees the towers of Camelot. CAN SUCH THINGS BE Meseemed that while she played, while lightly yet Her fingers fell, as roses bloom by bloom, I listenedâdead within a mighty room Of some old palace where great casements let Gaunt moonlight in, that glimpsed a parapet Of statued marble: in the arrased gloom Majestic pictures towered, dim as doom, The dreams of Titian and of Tintoret. And then, it seemed, along a corridor, A mile of oak, a stricken footstep came, Hurrying, yet slow. . . . I thought long centuries Passed ere she enteredâshe, I loved of yore, For whom I died, who wildly wailed my name And bent and kissed me on the mouth and eyes. KNIGHT-ERRANT Onward he gallops through enchanted gloom.â The phantoms of the forest, dark and dim, And shadows of vast death environ himâ Onward he spurs victorious over doom. Before his eyes that love's far fires illumeâ Where courage sits, impregnable and grimâ The form and features of her beauty swim, Beckoning him on with looks that fears consume. The thought of her distress, her lips to kiss, Mails him in triple might; and so at last To Lust's huge keep he comes; its giant wall, Wild-towering, frowning from the precipice: And through its gate, borne like a bugle-blast, O'er night and hell he thunders to his all. THE ARTIST In story books, when I was very young, I knew her first, one of the Fairy Race; And then it was her picture took its place, Framed round with love's deep gold, and draped and hung High in my heart's red room: no song was sung, No tale of passion told, I did not grace With her associated form and face, And intimated charm of touch and tongue. As years went on she grew to more and more, Until each thing, symbolic to my heart Of beauty,âsuch as honor, truth, and fame,â Within the studio of my soul's thought wore Her lineaments, whom I, with all my art, Strove to embody and to give a name. POETRY AND PHILOSOPHY Out of the past the dim leaves spake to me The thoughts of Pindar with a voice so sweet HyblÃ¦an bees seemed swarming my retreat Around the reedy well of Poesy. I closed the book. Then, knee to neighbor knee, Sat with the soul of Plato, to repeat Doctrines, till mine seemed some Socratic seat High on the summit of Philosophy. Around the wave of one Religion taught Her first rude children. From the stars that burned Above the mountained ether, Science learned The first vague lessons of the work she wrought. Daughters of God, in whom we still behold The Age of Iron and the Age of Gold. âQUO VADISâ It is as if imperial trumpets broke Again the silence on War's iron height; And CÃ¦sar's armored legions marched to fight, While Rome, blood-red upon her mountain-yoke, Blazed like an awful sunset. At a stroke, Again I see the living torches light The horrible revels, and the bloated, white, Bayed brow of Nero smiling through the smoke: And here and there a little band of slaves Among dark ruins; and the form of Paul, Bearded and gaunt, expounding still the Word: And towards the North the tottering architraves Of empire; and, wild-waving over all, The flaming figure of a Gothic sword. TO A CRITIC R. H. S. Song hath a catalogue of lovely things Thy kind hath oft defiled,âwhose spite misleads The world too often!âwhere the poet reads, As in a fable, of old envyings, Crows, such as thou, which hush the bird that sings, Or kill it with their cawings: thorns and weeds, Such as thyself, 'midst which the wind sows seeds Of flow'rs, these crush before one blossom swings. But here and there the wisdom of a School Unknown to these hath often written down âFameâ in white ink the future hath turned brown; When every beauty, heaped with ridicule, In their ignoble prose, proved their renown, Making each famousâas an ass or fool. QUATRAINS I Poetry Who hath beheld the goddess face to face, Blind with her beauty, all his days shall go Climbing lone mountains towards her temple's place, Weighed with Song's sweet, inexorable woe. II The Unimaginative Each form of beauty 's but the new disguise Of thoughts more beautiful than forms can be; Sceptics, who search with unanointed eyes, Never the Earth's wild Fairy-dance shall see. III Music God-born before the Sons of God, she hurled, With awful symphonies of flood and fire, God's name on rocking chaosâworld by world Flamed as the universe rolled from her lyre. IV The Three Elements They come as couriers of Heaven: their feet Sonorous-sandaled with majestic awe; In raiment of swift foam and wind and heat, Blowing the trumpets of God's wrath and law. V Rome Above the Circus of the World she sat, Beautiful and base, a harlot crowned with pride: Fierce Nations, upon whom she sneered and spat, Shrieked at her feet and for her pastime died. VI On Reading the Life of Haroun er Reshid Down all the lanterned Bagdad of our youth He steals, with golden justice for the poor: Within his palaceâyou shall know the truth!â A blood-smeared headsman hides behind each door. VII Mnemosyne In classic beauty, cold, immaculate, A voiceful sculpture, stern and still she stands, Upon her brow deep-chiselled love and hate, That sorrow o'er dead roses in her hands. VIII Beauty High as a star, yet lowly as a flower, Unknown she takes her unassuming place At Earth's proud masqueradeâthe appointed hour Strikes, and, behold! the marvel of her face. IX The Stars Theseâthe bright symbols of man's hope and fame, In which he reads his blessing or his curseâ Are syllables with which God speaks His name In the vast utterance of the universe. X Echo Dweller in hollow places, hills and rocks, Daughter of Silence and old Solitude, Tip-toe she stands within her cave or wood, Her only life the noises that she mocks. THE DREAMER Even as a child he loved to thrid the bowers, And mark the loafing sunlight's lazy laugh; Or, on each season, spell the epitaph Of its dead months repeated in their flowers; Or list the music of the strolling showers, Whose vagabond notes strummed through a twinkling staff, Or read the day's delivered monograph Through all the chapters of its dÃ¦dal hours. Still with the same child-faith and child regard He looks on Nature, hearing, at her heart, The Beautiful beat out the time and place, Through which no lesson of this life is hard, No struggle vain of science or of art, That dies with failure written on its face. WINTER The flute, whence Summer's dreamy finger-tips Drew music,âripening the cramped kernels in The burly chestnut and the chinquapin, Red-rounding-out the oval haws and hips,â Now Winter crushes to his stormy lips, And surly songs whistle around his chin; Now the wild days and wilder nights begin When, at the eaves, the lengthening icicle drips. Thy songs, O Summer, are not lost so soon! Still dwells a memory in thy hollow flute, Which unto Winter's masculine airs doth give Thy own creative qualities of tune, Through which we see each bough bend white with fruit, Each branch with bloom, in snow commemorative. MID-WINTER All day the clouds hung ashen with the cold; And through the snow the muffled waters fell; The day seemed drowned in grief too deep to tell, Like some old hermit whose last bead is told. At eve the wind woke, and the snow clouds rolled Aside to leave the fierce sky visible; Harsh as an iron landscape of wan Hell The dark hills hung framed in with gloomy gold. And then, towards night, the wind seemed some one at My window, wailing: now a little child Crying outside my door; and now the long Howl of some starved beast down the flue.âI sat And knew 't was Winter with his madman song Of miseries on which he stared and smiled. SPRING First came the rain, loud, with sonorous lips; A pursuivant who heralded a prince: And dawn put on her livery of tints, And dusk bound gold about her hair and hips: And, all in silver mail, the sunlight came, A knight, who bade the winter let him pass; And freed imprisoned beauty, naked as The Court of Love, in all her wildflower shame. And so she came, in breeze-borne loveliness, Across the hills; and heav'n bent down to bless: Above her head the birds were as a choir; And at her feet, like some strong worshiper, The shouting water pÃ¦an'd praise of her, Who, with blue eyes, set the wild world on fire. TRANSFORMATION It is the time when, by the forest falls, The touch-me-nots hang faery folly-caps; When ferns and flowers fill the lichened laps Of rocks with color, rich as orient shawls: And in my heart I hear a voice that calls Me woodward, where the hamadryad wraps Her limbs in bark, and, bubbling in the saps, Sings the sweet Greek of Pan's old madrigals: There is a gleam that lures me up the streamâ A Naiad swimming with wet limbs of light? Perfume that leads me on from dream to dreamâ An oread's footprints flowering into flight? And, lo! meseems I am a Faun again, One with the myths that I pursue in vain. RESPONSE There is a music of immaculate love, That beats within the virginal veins of Spring,â And trillium blossoms, (like the stars that cling To fairies' wands;) and, strung on sprays above, White-hearts and mandrake blooms, (that look enough Like the elves' washingâwhite with laundering Of May-moon dews;) and all pale-opening Wildflowers of the woods are born thereof. There is no sod Spring's white foot brushes but Must feel the music that vibrates within, And thrill to the communicated touch Responsive harmonies, that must unshut The heart of Beauty for Song's concrete kin, Emotionsâthat are flowersâborn of such. THE SWASHBUCKLER Squat-nosed and broad, of big and pompous port; A tavern visage, apoplexy haunts, All pimple-puffed: the Falstaff-like resort Of fat debauchery, whose veined cheek flaunts A flabby purple: rusty-spurred he stands In rakehell boots and belt, and hanger that Claps when, with greasy gauntlets on his hands, He swaggers past in cloak and slouch-plumed hat. Aggression marches armies in his words; And in his oaths great deeds ride cap-Ã -pie; His looks, his gestures breathe the breath of swords; And in his carriage camp all wars to be:â With him, of battles there shall be no lack While buxom wenches are and stoops of sack. SIMULACRA Dark in the west the sunset's sombre wrack Unrolled vast walls the rams of war had split, Along whose battlements the battle lit Tempestuous beacons; and, with gates hurled back, A mighty city, red with ruin and sack, Through burning breaches, crumbling bit by bit, Showed where the God of Slaughter seemed to sit With Conflagration glaring at each crack.â Who knows? perhaps as sleep unto us makes Our dreams as real as our waking seems With recollections time can not destroy, So in the mind of Nature now awakes, Haply, some wilder memory, and she dreams The stormy story of the fall of Troy. THE BLUEBIRD From morn till noon upon the window-pane The tempest tapped with rainy finger-nails, And all the afternoon the blustering gales Beat at the door with furious feet of rain. The rose, near which the lily's bloom lay slain, Like some red wound dripped by the garden rails, On which the sullen slug left silvery trailsâ It seemed the sun would never shine again. Then in the drench, long, loud, and clarion-clear,â A skyey herald tabarded in blue,â A bluebird warbled . . . and at once a bow Was bent in heaven, and I seemed to hear God's sapphire spaces crystallizing through The strata'd clouds in azure tremolo. CAVERNS Written of Colossal Cave, Kentucky. Aisles and abysses; leagues, no man explores, Of rock that labyrinths and night that drips; Where everlasting silence broods, with lips Of adamant, o'er earthquake-builded floors. Where forms, such as the DÃ¦mon-World adores, Laborious water carves; whence echo slips Wild-tongued o'er pools where petrifaction strips Her breasts of crystal from which crystal pours.â Here where primordial fear, the Gorgon, sits, Staring all life to stone in ghastly mirth, I seem to tread, with awe no tongue can tell,â Beneath vast domes, by torrent-tortured pits, 'Mid wrecks terrific of the ruined Earth,â An ancient causeway of forgotten Hell. A VOICE ON THE WIND PROEM Oh, for a soul that fulfills Music like that of a bird! Thrilling with rapture the hills, Heedless if any one heard. Or, like the flower that blooms Lone in the midst of the trees, Filling the woods with perfumes, Careless if any one sees. Or, like the wandering wind, Over the meadows that swings, Bringing wild sweets to mankind, Knowing not that which it brings. Oh, for a way to impart Beauty, no matter how hard! Like unto Nature, whose art Never once dreams of reward. A VOICE ON THE WIND I She walks with the wind on the windy height When the rocks are loud and the waves are white, And all night long she calls through the night, âO my children, come home!â Her bleak gown, torn as a tattered cloud, Tosses around her like a shroud, While over the deep her voice rings loud,â âO my children, come home, come home! O my children, come home!â II Who is she who wanders alone, When the wind drives sheer and the rain is blown? Who walks all night and makes her moan, âO my children, come home!â Whose face is raised to the blinding gale; Whose hair blows black and whose eyes are pale, While over the world goes by her wail,â âO my children, come home, come home! O my children, come home!â III She walks with the wind in the windy wood; The dark rain drips from her hair and hood, And her cry sobs by, like a ghost pursued, âO my children, come home!â Where the trees loom gaunt and the rocks stretch drear, The owl and the fox crouch back in fear, As wild through the wood her voice they hear,â âO my children, come home, come home! O my children, come home!â IV Who is she who shudders by When the boughs blow bare and the dead leaves fly? Who walks all night with her wailing cry, âO my children, come home!â Who, strange of look, and wild of tongue, With wan feet wounded and hands wild-wrung, Sweeps on and on with her cry, far-flung,â âO my children, come home, come home! O my children, come home!â V 'T is the Spirit of Autumn, no man sees, The mother of Death and of Mysteries, Who cries on the wind all night to these, âO my children, come home!â The Spirit of Autumn, pierced with pain, Calling her children home again, Death and Dreams, through ruin and rain,â âO my children, come home, come home! O my children, come home!â THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE Do you know the way that goes Over fields of rue and rose,â Warm of scent and hot of hue, Roofed with heaven's bluest blue,â To the Vale of Dreams Come True? Do you know the path that twines, Banked with elder bosks and vines, Under boughs that shade a stream, Hurrying, crystal as a gleam, To the Hills of Love a-Dream? Tell me, tell me, have you gone Through the fields and woods of dawn, Meadowlands and trees that roll, Great of grass and huge of bole, To the Land of Hearts Made Whole? On the way, among the fields, Poppies lift vermilion shields, In whose hearts the golden Noon, Murmuring her drowsy tune, Rocks the sleepy bees that croon. On the way, amid the woods, Mandrakes muster multitudes, 'Mid whose blossoms, white as tusk, Glides the glimmering Forest-Dusk, With her moths of fluttering musk. Here you hear the stealthy stir Of shy lives of hoof and fur; Harmless things that hide and peer, Hearts that sucked the milk of fearâ Fox and rabbit, squirrel and deer. Here you see the mossy flight Of faint forms that love the nightâ Whippoorwill and owlet-things, Whose weird call before you brings Wonder-worlds of happenings. Now in sunlight, now in shade, Water, like a brandished blade, Foaming forward, wild of flight, Startles, then arrests the sight, Whirling steely loops of light. Through the tree-tops, down the vale, Breezes roam, and leave a trail Of cool music that the birds,â Following in happy herds,â Gather up in twittering words. Blossoms, frail and manifold, Shower the way with pearl and gold; Blurs, that seem the darling print Of the Springtime's feet, or glint Of her twinkling gown's torn tint. There the Myths of old endure: Dreams that are the world-soul's cure; Things that have no place or play In the facts of Everyday Round your presence smile and sway. Suddenly your eyes may see, Stepping softly from a tree,â Slim of form and wet with dew,â The brown Dryad; lips the hue Of a berry bit into. You may mark the Naiad rise From her pool's reflected skies; In her gaze the heaven that dreams, Starred, in twilight-haunted streams, Mixed with water's grayer gleams. You may see the laurel's girth, Big with bloom, give fragrant birth To the Oread whose hair,â Musk and darkness, light and air,â Fills the hush with wonder there. You may mark the rocks divide, And the Faun before you glide, Piping on a magic reed, Sowing many a music-seed, From which bloom and mushroom bead. Of the rain and sunlight born, Young of beard and young of horn, You may see the Satyr lie, With a very knowing eye, Teaching fledgeling birds to fly. These shall cheer and follow you Through the Vale of Dreams Come True: Wind-like voices, leaf-like feet; Forms of mist and hazy heat, In whose pulses sunbeams beat. Lo! you tread enchanted ground! From the hollows all around Elf and spirit, gnome and fay, Guide your feet along the way Till the dewy close of day. Then beside you, jet on jet, Emerald-hued and violet, Flickering, floats a firefly light, Aye to guide your steps aright From the valley to the height. Steep the way is; when at last, Vale and wood and stream are passed, From the heights you shall behold Panther heavens of spotted gold Tiger-tawny deeps unfold. You shall see on stocks and stones Sunset's bell-deep color tones Fallen; and the valleys filled With dusk's purple music, spilled On the silence, rapture-thrilled. Then, as answering bell greets bell, Night ring in her miracle Of the domÃ©d dark, o'er-rolled, Note on note, with starlight cold, 'Twixt the moon's broad peal of gold. On the hill-top Love-a-Dream Shows you then her window-gleam; Brings you home and folds your soul In the peace of vale and knoll, In the Land of Hearts Made Whole. THE WIND OF SUMMER From the hills and far away All the long, warm summer day Comes the Wind and seems to say: âCome, oh, come! and let us go Where the meadows bend and blow, Waving with the white-tops' snow. â'Neath the hyssop-colored sky 'Mid the meadows we will lie Watching the white clouds roll by; âWhile your hair my hands shall press With a cooling tenderness Till your grief grows less and less: âCome, oh, come! and let us roam Where the rock-cut waters comb Flowing crystal into foam. âUnder trees whose trunks are brown, On the banks that violets crown, We will watch the fish flash down; âWhile my voice your ear shall soothe With a whisper soft and smooth Till your care shall wax uncouth. âCome! where forests, line on line,â Armies of the oak and pine,â Scale the hills and shout and shine. âWe will wander, hand in hand, Ways where tall the toadstools stand, Mile-stones white of Fairyland. âWhile your eyes my lips shall kiss, Dewy as a wild-rose is, Till they gaze on naught but bliss. âOn the meadows you will hear, Leaning low your spirit ear, Cautious footsteps drawing near. âYou will deem it but a bee, Murmuring soft and sleepily, Till your inner sight shall see â'T is a presence passing slow, All its shining hair ablow, Through the white-tops' tossing snow. âBy the waters, if you will, And your inmost soul is still, Melody your ears shall fill. âYou will deem it but the stream Rippling onward in a dream, Till upon your gaze shall gleam âArm of spray and throat of foamâ 'T is a spirit there a-roam Where the radiant waters comb. âIn the forest, if you heed, You shall hear a magic reed Sow sweet notes like silver seed. âYou will deem your ears have heard Stir of tree or song of bird, Till your startled eyes are blurred âBy a vision, instant seen, Naked gold and naked green, Glimmering the boughs between. âFollow me! and you shall see Wonder-worlds of mystery That are only known to me!â Thus outside my city door Speaks the Wind its wildwood lore, Speaks, and lo! I go once more. THE WIND OF WINTER The Winter Wind, the wind of death, Who knocked upon my door, Now through the key-hole entereth, Invisible and hoar: He breathes around his icy breath And treads the flickering floor. I heard him, wandering in the night, Tap at my window pane, With ghostly fingers, snowy white, I heard him tug in vain, Until the shuddering candle-light Did cringe with fear and strain. The fire, awakened by his voice, Leapt up with frantic arms, Like some wild babe that greets, with noise, Its father home who storms, With rosy gestures that rejoice And crimson kiss that warms. Now in the hearth he sits and, drowned Among the ashes, blows; Or through the room goes stealing round On cautious-stepping toes, Deep-mantled in the drowsy sound Of night that sleets and snows. And oft, like some thin fairy-thing, The stormy hush amid, I hear his captive trebles ring Beneath the kettle's lid; Or now a harp of elfland string In some dark cranny hid. Again I hear him, imp-like, whine, Cramped in the gusty flue; Or knotted in the resinous pine Raise goblin cry and hue, While through the smoke his eyeballs shine, A sooty red and blue. At last I hear him, nearing dawn, Take up his roaring broom, And sweep wild leaves from wood and lawn, And from the heavens the gloom, To show the gaunt world lying wan, And morn's cold rose a-bloom. THE LEAF-CRICKET I Small twilight singer Of dew and mist: thou ghost-gray, gossamer winger Of dusk's dim glimmer, How cool thy note sounds; how thy wings of shimmer Vibrate, soft-sighing, Meseems, for Summer that is dead or dying. I stand and listen, And at thy song the garden-beds, that glisten With rose and lily, Seem touched with sadness; and the tuberose chilly, Breathing around its cold and colorless breath, Fills the pale evening with wan hints of death. II I see thee quaintly Beneath the leaf; thy shell-shaped winglets faintlyâ As thin as spangle Of cobwebbed rainâheld up at airy angle; I hear thy tinkle, Thy fairy notes, the silvery stillness sprinkle; Investing wholly The moonlight with divinest melancholy: Until, in seeming, I see the Spirit of the Summer dreaming Amid her ripened orchards, apple-strewn, Her great, grave eyes fixed on the harvest-moon. III As dewdrops beady, As mist minute, thy notes ring low and reedy: The vaguest vapor Of melody, now near; now, like some taper Of sound, far fadingâ Thou will-o'-wisp of music aye evading. Among the bowers, The fog-washed stalks of Autumn's weeds and flowers, By hill and hollow, I hear thy murmur and in vain I followâ Thou jack-o'-lantern voice, thou elfin cry, Thou dirge, that tellest Beauty she must die. IV And when the frantic Wild winds of Autumn with the dead leaves antic; And walnuts scatter The mire of lanes; and dropping acorns patter In grove and forest, Like some frail grief, with the rude blast thou warrest, Sending thy slender Far cry against the gale, that, rough, untender, Untouched of sorrow, Sweeps thee aside, where, haply, I to-morrow Shall find thee lying, tiny, cold and crushed, Thy weak wings folded and thy music hushed. THE OWLET I When dusk is drowned in drowsy dreams, And slow the hues of sunset die; When firefly and moth go by, And in still streams the new-moon gleams, A sickle in the sky: Then from the hills there comes a cry, The owlet's cry: A shivering voice that sobs and screams, That, frightened, screams:â âWho is it, who is it, who? Who rides through the dusk and dew, With a pair of horns, As thin as thorns, And face a bubble-blue? Who, who, who! Who is it, who is it, who?â II When night has dulled the lily's white, And opened wide the moonflower's eyes, When pale mists rise and veil the skies, And round the height in whispering flight The night wind sounds and sighs: Then in the woods again it cries, The owlet cries: A shivering voice that calls in fright, In maundering fright:â âWho is it, who is it, who? Who walks with a shuffling shoe, 'Mid the gusty trees, With a face none sees, And a form as ghostly too? Who, who, who! Who is it, who is it, who?â III When midnight leans a listening ear And tinkles on her insect lutes; When 'mid the roots the cricket flutes, And marsh and mere, now far, now near, A jack-o'-lantern foots: Then o'er the pool again it hoots, The owlet hoots: A voice that shivers as with fear, That cries in fear:â âWho is it, who is it, who? Who creeps with his glow-worm crew Above the mire With a corpse-light fire, As only dead men do? Who, who, who! Who is it, who is it, who?â THE POET He stands above all worldly schism, And, gazing over life's abysm, Beholds, within the starry range Of heaven, laws of death and change, That, through his soul's prophetic prism, Are turned to rainbows wild and strange. Through nature is his hope made surer Of that ideal, his allurer, By whom his life is upward drawn To mount pale pinnacles of dawn, 'Mid which all that is fairer, purer Of love and lore it comes upon. An alkahest, that makes gold metal Of dross, his mind isâwhere one petal Of one wild-rose will well outweigh The piled-up facts of every-dayâ Where commonplaces, there that settle, Are changed to things of heavenly ray. He climbs by steps of stars and flowers, Companioned of the spirit Hours, And sets his feet in pastures where No merely mortal feet may fare; And higher than the stars he towers Though lowly as the flowers there. His comrades are his own high fancies And thoughts in which his soul romances; And every part of heaven or earth He visits, lo, assumes new worth; And touched with loftier traits and trances Reshines as with a lovelier birth. He is the play, also the player; The word that 's said, likewise the sayer; And in the books of heart and head There is no thing he has not read; Of time and tears he is the weigher, And mouthpiece 'twixt the quick and dead. He dies: but, mounting ever higher, Wings PhÅnix-like from out his pyre Above our mortal day and night, Clothed on with sempiternal light; And raimented in thought's fine fire Flames on in everlasting flight. Unseen, yet seen, on heights of visions, Above all praise and world derisions, His spirit and his deathless brood Of dreams fare on, a multitude, While on the pillar of great missions His name and place are granite-hewed. SUMMER NOONTIDE The slender snail clings to the leaf Gray on its silvered underside; And slowly, slowlier than the snail, with brief Bright steps, whose ripening touch foretells the sheaf, Her warm hands berry-dyed, Comes down the tanned Noontide. The pungent fragrance of the mint And pennyroyal drench her gown, That leaves long shreds of trumpet-blossom tint Among the thorns, and everywhere the glint Of gold and white and brown Her flowery steps waft down. The leaves, like hands with emerald veined, Along her way try their wild best To reach the jewelâwhose hot hue was drained From some rich rose that all the June containedâ The butterfly, soft pressed Upon her sunny breast. Her shawl, the lace-like elder bloom, She hangs upon the hillside brake, Smelling of warmth and of her breast's perfume, And, lying in the citron-colored gloom Beside the lilied lake, She stares the buds awake. Or, with a smile, through watery deeps She leads the oaring turtle's legs; Or guides the crimson fin, that swims and sleeps, From pad to pad, from which the young frog leaps; And to its nest's green eggs The reed-bird there that begs. Then 'mid the fields of unmown hay She shows the bees where sweets are found; And points the butterflies, at airy play, And dragon-flies, along the water-way, Where honeyed flowers abound For them to flicker round. Or where ripe apples pelt with gold Some barnâaround which, coned with snow, The wild-potato bloomsâshe mounts its old Mossed roof, and through warped sides, the knots have holed, Lets her long glances glow Into the loft below. To show the mud-wasp at its cell Slenderly busy: swallows, too, Packing against a beam their nest's clay shell; And crouching in the dark the owl as well With all her downy crew Of owlets gray of hue. These are her joys; and until dusk Lounging she walks where reapers reap, From sultry raiment shaking scents of musk, Rustling the corn within its silken husk, And driving down heav'n's deep White herds of clouds like sheep. TO THE LOCUST Thou pulse of hotness, who, with reed-like breast, Makest meridian music, long and loud, Accentuating summer!âdost thy best To make the sunbeams fiercer, and to crowd With lonesomeness the long, close afternoonâ When Labor leans, swart-faced and beady-browed, Upon his sultry scytheâthou tangible tune Of heat, whose waves incessantly arise Quivering and clear beneath the cloudless skies. Thou singest, and upon his haggard hills Drouth yawns and rubs his heavy eyes and wakes; Brushes the hot hair from his face; and fills The land with death as sullenly he takes Downward his dusty way: 'midst woods and fields At every pool his burning thirst he slakes; No grove so deep, no bank so high it shields A spring from him; no creek evades his eye; He needs but look and they are withered dry. Thou singest, and thy song is as a spell Of somnolence to charm the land with sleep; A thorn of sound that pierces dale and dell, Diffusing slumber over vale and steep. Sleepy the forest, nodding sleepy boughs; Sleepy the pastures with their sleepy sheep; Sleepy the creek where sleepily the cows Stand knee-deep, and the very heaven seems Sleepy and lost in undetermined dreams. Art thou a rattle that Monotony, Summer's dull nurse, old sister of slow Time, Shakes for Day's peevish pleasure, who in glee Takes its discordant music for sweet rhyme? Or oboe that the Summer Noontide plays, Sitting with Ripeness 'neath the orchard-tree, Trying repeatedly the same shrill phrase, Until the musky peach with weariness Drops, and the hum of murmuring bees grows less? JULY Now 'tis the time when, tall, The long blue torches of the bellflower gleam Among the trees; and, by the wooded stream, In many a fragrant ball, Blooms of the button-bush fall. Let us go forth and seek Woods where the wild plums redden and the beech Plumps its stout burrs; and, swelling, just in reach, The pawpaw, emerald-sleek, Ripens along the creek. Now 't is the time when ways Of glimmering green flaunt white the giant plumes Of the black-cohosh; and through bramble glooms,â A blur of orange rays,â The butterfly-blossoms blaze. Let us go forth and hear The spiral music that the locusts beat, And that small spray of sound, so grassy sweet, Dear to a country ear, The cricket's summer cheer. Now golden celandine Is hairy hung with silvery sacs of seeds, And bugled o'er with freckled gold, like beads, Beneath the fox-grape vine, The jewel-weed's blossoms shine. Let us go forth and see The dragon- and the butterfly, like gems, Spangling the sunbeams; and the clover stems, Weighed down with many a bee, Nodding mellifluously. Now morns are full of song; The cat-bird and the red-bird and the jay Upon the hilltops rouse the ruddy day, Who, dewy, blithe, and strong, Lures their wild wings along. Now noons are full of dreams; The clouds of heaven and the wandering breeze Follow a vision; and the flowers and trees, The hills and fields and streams, Are lapped in mystic gleams. The nights are full of love; The stars and moon take up the golden tale Of the sunk sun, and passionate and pale, Mixing their fires above, Grow eloquent thereof. Such days are like a sigh That beauty heaves from a full heart of bliss: Such nights are like the sweetness of a kiss On lips that half denyâ The warm lips of July. EVENING ON THE FARM From out the hills where twilight stands, Above the shadowy pasture-lands, With strained and strident cry, Beneath pale skies that sunset bands, The bull-bats fly. A cloud hangs over, strange of shape, And, colored like the half-ripe grape, Seems some uneven stain On heaven's azure, thin as crape, And blue as rain. By ways, that sunset's sardonyx O'erflares, and gates the farm-boy clicks, Through which the cattle came, The mullein stalks seem giant wicks Of downy flame. From woods no glimmer enters in, Above the streams that, wandering, win From out the violet hills, Those haunters of the dusk begin, The whippoorwills. Adown the dark the firefly marks Its flight in golden-emerald sparks; And, loosened from his chain, The shaggy watch-dog bounds and barks, And barks again. Each breeze brings scents of hill-heaped hay; And now an owlet, far away, Cries twice or thrice, âT-o-o-w-h-o-oâ; And cool dim moths of mottled gray Flit through the dew. The silence sounds its frog-bassoon, Where, on the woodland creek's lagoon, Pale as a ghostly girl Lost 'mid the trees, looks down the moon With face of pearl. Within the shed where logs, late hewed, Smell forest-sweet, and chips of wood Make blurs of white and brown, The brood-hen cuddles her warm brood Of teetering down. The clattering guineas in the tree Din for a time; and quietly The hen-house, near the fence, Sleeps, save for some brief rivalry Of cocks and hens. A cow-bell tinkles by the rails, Where, streaming white in foaming pails, Milk makes an uddery sound; While overhead the black bat trails Around and round. The night is still. The slow cows chew A drowsy cud. The bird that flew And sang is in its nest. It is the time of falling dew, Of dreams and rest. The brown bees sleep; and round the walk, The garden path, from stalk to stalk The bungling beetle booms, Where two soft shadows stand and talk Among the blooms. The stars are thick: the light is dead That dyed the west: and Drowsyhead, Tuning his cricket-pipe, Nods, and some apple, round and red, Drops over-ripe. Now down the road, that shambles by, A window, shining like an eye Through climbing rose and gourd, Shows where Toil sups and these things lieâ His heart and hoard. UNDER THE HUNTER'S MOON White from her chrysalis of cloud, The moth-like moon swings upward through the night; And all the bee-like stars that crowd Heav'n's hollow hive wane in her silvery light. Along the distance folds of mist Hang frost-pale, ridging all the dark with gray; Tinting the trees with amethyst, Touching with pearl and purple every spray. All night the stealthy frost and fog Conspire to slay the rich-robed weeds and flowers; To strip the woods of wealth, and clog With piled-up gold of leaves the creek that cowers. I seem to see their Spirits stand, Molded of moonlight, faint of form and face, Now reaching high a chilly hand To pluck some walnut from its spicy place: Now with fine fingers, phantom-cold, Splitting the wahoo's pods of rose, and thin The bittersweet's globes of gold, To show the coal-red berries packed within: Now on frail threads of gossamer Stringing slim pearls of moisture; necklacing The flow'rs; and spreading cobweb fur, Crystalled with stardew, over everything; While 'neath the moon, with moon-white feet, They wander and a moon-chill music draw From thin leaf-cricket flutesâthe sweet, Dim dirge of Autumn dying in the shaw. IN THE LANE When the hornet hangs in the hollyhock, And the brown bee drones i' the rose, And the west is a red-streaked four-o'-clock, And summer is near its closeâ It 'sâOh, for the gate and the locust lane And dusk and dew and home again! When the katydid sings and the cricket cries, And ghosts of the mists ascend, And the evening-star is a lamp i' the skies, And summer is near its endâ It 'sâOh, for the fence and the leafy lane, And the twilight peace and the tryst again! When the owlet hoots in the dogwood-tree, That leans to the rippling Run, And the wind is a wildwood melody, And summer is almost doneâ It 'sâOh, for the bridge and the bramble lane, And the fragrant hush and her hands again! When fields smell moist with the dewy hay, And woods are cool and wan, And a path for dreams is the Milky-way, And summer is nearly goneâ It'sâOh, for the rock and the woodland lane, And the silence and stars and her lips again! When the weight of the apples breaks down the limbs, And musk-melons split with sweet, And the moon's broad boat in the heaven swims, And summer has spent its heatâ It 'sâOh, for the lane, the trysting lane, And the deep-mooned night and her love again! EPIPHANY There is nothing that eases my heart so much As the wind that blows from the great green hills; 'T is a hand of balsam whose healing touch Unburdens my bosom of ills. There is nothing that maketh my soul to rejoice Like the sunset flaming without a flaw: 'T is a burning bush whence God's own voice Addresses my spirit with awe. There is nothing that hallows my mind, meseems, Like the night with its moon and its starry slope: 'T is a mystical lily whose golden gleams Fulfill my being with hope. There is nothing, no, nothing, we see and feel, That speaks to our souls some beautiful thought, That was not created to help us and heal Our lives that are overwrought. LIFE I Pessimist There is never a thing we dream or do But was dreamed and done in the ages gone; Everything 's old; there is nothing that 's new, And so it will be while the world goes on. The thoughts we think have been thought before; The deeds we do have long been done; We pride ourselves on our love and lore And both are as old as the moon and sun. We strive and struggle and swink and sweat, And the end for each is one and the same; Time and the sun and the frost and wet Will wear from its pillar the greatest name. No answer comes for our prayer or curse, No word replies though we shriek in air; Ever the taciturn universe Stretches unchanged for our curse or prayer. With our mind's small light in the dark we crawl,â Glow-worm glimmers that creep about,â Till the Power that made us, over us all Poises His foot and treads us out. Unasked He fashions us out of clay, A little water, a little dust, And then in our holes He thrusts us away, With never a word, to rot and rust. 'T is a sorry play with a sorry plot, This life of hate and of lust and pain, Where we play our parts and are soon forgot, And all that we do is done in vain. II Optimist There is never a dream but it shall come true, And never a deed but was wrought by plan; And life is filled with the strange and new, And ever has been since the world began. As mind develops and soul matures These two shall parent Earth's mightier acts; Love is a fact, and 't is love endures 'Though the world make wreck of all other facts. Through thought alone shall our age obtain Above all ages gone before; The tribes of sloth, of brawn, not brain, Are the tribes that perish, are known no more. Within ourselves is a voice of Awe, And a hand that points to balanced Scales; The one is Love, and the other, Law, And their presence alone it is avails. For every shadow about our way There is a glory of moon and sun; But the hope within us hath more of ray Than the light of the sun and the moon made one. Behind all being a purpose lies, Undeviating as God hath willed; And he alone it is who dies, Who leaves that purpose unfulfilled. Life is an epic the Master sings, Whose theme is Man, and whose music, Soul, Where each is a word in the Song of Things, That shall roll on while the ages roll. MEETING IN THE WOODS Through ferns and moss the path wound to A hollow where the touch-me-nots Swung horns of honey filled with dew; And whereâlike footprintsâviolets blue And bluets made sweet sapphire blots, 'T was there that she had passed I knew. The grass, the very wilderness On either side, breathed rapture of Her passage: 't was her hand or dress That touched some treeâa slight caressâ That made the wood-birds sing above; Her step that woke the flowers, I guess. I hurried, till across my way, Foam-footed, bounding through the wood, A brook, like some wild child at play, Went laughing loud its roundelay; And there upon its bank she stood, A sunbeam clad in forest gray. And when she saw me, all her face Bloomed like a wild-rose by the stream; And to my breast a moment's space I gathered her; and all the place Seemed conscious of some happy dream Come true to add to Earth its grace: Some union, that was Heav'n's intentâ For which God made the worldâthe bliss, The love, that raised her innocent Young face to mine that, smiling, bent And sealed her first words with a kissâ As Love might close his testament. ROSE AND RUE Mamie Dean, ah, Mamie Dean, Do you remember where The willows used to screen The water flowing fair? The mill-stream's banks of green Where first our love begun, When you were seventeen, And I was twenty-one? Mamie Dean, ah, Mamie Dean, Do you remember how From th' old bridge we would leanâ The bridge that 's broken nowâ To watch the minnows sheen Through ripples of the Run, When you were seventeen, And I was twenty-one? Mamie Dean, ah, Mamie Dean, Do you remember, too, The old beech-tree, between Whose roots the windflowers grew? Where oft we sat at E'en, When stars were few or none, When you were seventeen, And I was twenty-one? Mamie Dean, ah, Mamie Dean, The bark is grown around The names I cut therein, And the true-love knot that bound; The love-knot, clear and clean, I carved when our love begun, When you were seventeen, And I was twenty-one. Mamie Dean, ah, Mamie Dean, The roof of the farm-house gray Is fallen and mossy green; Its rafters rot away: The old path scarce is seen Where oft our feet would run, When you were seventeen, And I was twenty-one. Mamie Dean, ah, Mamie Dean, Through each old tree and bough The lone winds cry and keenâ The place is haunted now With ghosts of what-has-been, And dreams of love-long-done, When you were seventeen, And I was twenty-one. Mamie Dean, ah, Mamie Dean, There, in your world of wealth, There, where you move a queen, Broken in heart and health, Does there ever rise a scene Of days, your thought would shun, When you were seventeen, And I was twenty-one? Mamie Dean, ah, Mamie Dean, Here, 'mid the rose and rue, Would God that your grave were green, And I were lying, too! Here on the hill, I mean, Where oft we laughed in the sun, When you were seventeen, And I was twenty-one. A MAID WHO DIED OLD Frail, shrunken face, so pinched and worn, That life has carved with care and doubt! So weary waiting, night and morn, For that which never came about! Pale lamp, so utterly forlorn, In which God's light at last is out. Gray hair, that lies so thin and prim On either side the sunken brows! And soldered eyes, so deep and dim, No word of man could now arouse! And hollow hands, so virgin slim, Forever clasped in silent vows! Poor breasts! that God designed for love, For baby lips to kiss and press! That never felt, yet dreamed thereof, The human touch, the child caressâ That lie like shriveled blooms above The heart's long-perished happiness. O withered body, Nature gave For purposes of death and birth, That never knew, and could but crave Those things perhaps that make life worthâ Rest now, alas! within the grave, Sad shell that served no end of Earth. COMMUNICANTS Who knows the things they dream, alas! Or feel, who lie beneath the ground? Perhaps the flowers, the leaves and grass That close them round. In spring the violets may spell The moods of them we know not of; Or lilies sweetly syllable Their thoughts of love. Haply, in summer, dew and scent Of all they feel may be a part; Each red rose be the testament Of some rich heart. The winds of fall be utterance, Perhaps, of saddest things they say; Wild leaves may word some dead romance In some dim way. In winter all their sleep profound Through frost may speak to grass and stream, Stilling them with the silent sound Of all they dream. THE DEAD DAY The west builds high a sepulchre Of cloudy granite and of gold, Where twilight's priestly hours inter The day like some great king of old. A censer, rimmed with silver fire, The new moon swings above his tomb; While, organ-stops of God's own choir, Star after star throbs in the gloom. And night draws near, the sadly sweetâ A nun whose face is calm and fairâ And kneeling at the dead day's feet Her soul goes up in silent prayer. In prayer, we feel through dewy gleam And flowery fragrance, andâabove All Earthâthe ecstasy and dream That haunt the mystic heart of love. ALLUREMENT Across the world she sends me word, From gardens fair as Falerina's, Now by a blossom, now a bird, To come to her, who long has lured With magic sweeter than Alcina's. I know not what her word may mean, I know not what may mean the voices She sends as messengers unseen, That through the hush around me lean, And whisper till my heart rejoices. Soon must I go. I must away. Must take the path that is appointed. God grant I reach her realm some day, Where by her love, as by a ray, My soul shall be anointed. AUGUST I Clad on with glowing beauty and the peace, Benign, of calm maturity, she stands Among her meadows and her orchard-lands, And on her mellowing gardens and her trees, Out of the ripe abundance of her hands Bestows increase And fruitfulness, as, wrapped in sunny ease, Blue-eyed and blonde she goes, Upon her bosom Summer's richest rose. II And he who follows where her footsteps lead, By hill and rock, by forest-side and stream, May glimpse the glory of her visible dream, In flower and fruit, in rounded nut and seed: She, in whose path the very shadows gleam; Whose humblest weed Seems lovelier than June's loveliest flower, indeed, And sweeter to the smell Than April's self within a rainy dell. III Hers is a sumptuous simplicity Within the fair Republic of her flowers, Where you may see her standing hours on hours, Breast-deep in gold, soft-holding up a bee To her hushed ear; or sitting under bowers Of greenery, A butterfly a-tilt upon her knee; Or lounging on her hip, Dancing a cricket on her finger-tip. IV Ay, let me breathe hot scents that tell of you: The hoary catnip and the meadow-mint, On which the honor of your touch doth print Itself as odor. Let me drink the hue Of ironweed and mist-flower here that hint With purple and blue, The rapture that your presence doth imbue Their inmost essence with, Immortal, though as transient as a myth. V Yea, let me feed on sounds that still assure Me where you hide: the brooks', whose happy din Tells where, the deep, retired woods within, Disrobed, you bathe; the birds', whose drowsy lure Tells where you slumber, your warm, nestling chin Soft on the pure, Pink cushion of your palm. . . . What better cure For care and memory's ache Than to behold you thus, and watch you wake. THE BUSH-SPARROW I Ere wild-haws, looming in the glooms, Build bolted drifts of breezy blooms; And in the whistling hollow there The red-bud bends, as brown and bare As buxom Roxy's up-stripped arm; From some gray hickory or larch, Sighed o'er the sodden meads of March, The sad heart thrills and reddens warm To hear you braving the rough storm, Frail courier of green-gathering powers; Rebelling sap in trees and flowers; Love's minister come heraldingâ O sweet saint-voice among bleak bowers! O brown-red pursuivant of Spring! II âMoan,â sob the woodland waters still Down bloomless ledges of the hill; And gray, gaunt clouds like harpies hang In harpy heavens, and swoop and clang Sharp beaks and talons of the wind: Black scowl the forests, and unkind The far fields as the near: while song Seems murdered and all beauty wrong. One weak frog only in the thaw Of spawny pools wakes cold and raw, Expires a melancholy bass And stops as if bewildered: then Along the frowning wood again, Flung in the thin wind's vulture face, From woolly tassels of the proud, Red-bannered maples, long and loud, âThe Spring is come! is here! her Grace! her Grace! III âHer Grace, the Spring! her Grace! her Grace! Climbs, beautiful and sunny browed, Up, up the kindling hills and wakes Blue berries in the berry brakes: With fragrant flakes, that blow and bleach, Deep-powders smothered quince and peach: Eyes dogwoods with a thousand eyes: Teaches each sod how to be wise With twenty wildflowers to one weed, And kisses germs that they may seed. In purest purple and sweet white Treads up the happier hills of light, Bloom-, cloudy-borne, song in her hair And balm and beam of odorous air. Winds, her retainers; and the rains Her yeomen strong who sweep the plains: Her scarlet knights of dawn, and gold Of eve, her panoply unfold: Her herald tabarded behold! Awake to greet! prepare to sing! She comes, the darling Duchess, Spring!â QUIET 'A log-hut in the solitude, A clapboard roof to rest beneath! This side, the shadow-haunted wood; That side, the sunlight-haunted heath. At daybreak Morn will come to me In raiment of the white winds spun; Slim in her rosy hand the key That opes the gateway of the sun. Her smile will help my heart enough With love to labor all the day, And cheer the road, whose rocks are rough, With her smooth footprints, each a ray. At dusk a voice will call afar, A lone voice like the whippoorwill's; And, on her shimmering brow one star, Night will descend the western hills. She at my door till dawn will stand, With gothic eyes, that, dark and deep, Are mirrors of a mystic land, Fantastic with the towns of sleep. MUSIC Thou, oh, thou! Thou of the chorded shell and golden plectrum, thou Of the dark eyes and pale pacific brow! Music, who by the plangent waves, Or in the echoing night of labyrinthine caves, Or on God's mountains, lonely as the stars, Touchest reverberant bars Of immemorial sorrow and amaze;â Keeping regret and memory awake, And all the immortal ache Of love that leans upon the past's sweet days In retrospection!ânow, oh, now, Interpreter and heart-physician, thou Who gazest on the heaven and the hell Of life, and singest each as well, Touch with thy all-mellifluous finger-tips Or thy melodious lips, This sickness named my soul, Making it whole As is an echo of a chord, Or some symphonic word, Or sweet vibrating sigh, That deep, resurgent, still doth rise and die On thy voluminous roll; Part of the beauty and the mystery That axles Earth with music; as a slave, Swinging it round and round on each sonorous pole, 'Mid spheric harmony, And choral majesty, And diapasoning of wind and wave; Speeding it on its far elliptic way 'Mid vasty anthemings of night and day.â O cosmic cry Of two eternities, wherein we see The phantasms, Death and Life, At endless strife Above the silence of a monster grave. A DREAM SHAPE With moon-white hearts that held a gleam I gathered wildflowers in a dream, And shaped a woman, whose sweet blood Was odor of the wildwood bud. From dew, the starlight arrowed through, I wrought a woman's eyes of blue; The lids that on her eyeballs lay Were rose-pale petals of the May. Out of a rosebud's veins I drew The fragrant crimson beating through The languid lips of her, whose kiss Was as a poppy's drowsiness. Out of the moonlight and the air I wrought the glory of her hair, That o'er her eyes' blue heaven lay Like some gold cloud o'er dawn of day. I took the music of the breeze And water, whispering in the trees, And shaped the soul that breathed below A woman's blossom breasts of snow. A shadow's shadow in the glass Of sleep, my spirit saw her pass: And thinking of it now, meseems We only live within our dreams. For in that time she was to me More real than our reality; More real than Earth, more real than Iâ The unreal things that pass and die. THE OLD BARN Low, swallow-swept and gray, Between the orchard and the spring, All its wide windows overflowing hay, And crannied doors a-swing, The old barn stands to-day. Deep in its hay the Leghorn hides A round white nest; and, humming soft On roof and rafter, or its log-rude sides, Black in the sun-shot loft, The building hornet glides. Along its corn-crib, cautiously As thieving fingers, skulks the rat; Or in warped stalls of fragrant timothy, Gnaws at some loosened slat, Or passes shadowy. A dream of drouth made audible Before its door, hot, harsh, and shrill All day the locust sings. . . . What other spell Shall hold it, lazier still Than the long day's, now tell:â Dusk and the cricket and the strain Of tree-toad and of frog; and stars That burn above the rich west's ribbÃ©d stain; And dropping pasture bars, And cowbells up the lane. Night and the moon and katydid, And leaf-lisp of the wind-touched boughs; And mazy shadows that the fireflies thrid; And sweet breath of the cows, And the lone owl here hid. THE WOOD WITCH There is a woodland witch who lies With bloom-bright limbs and beam-bright eyes, Among the water-flags that rank The slow brook's heron-haunted bank. The dragonflies, in brass and blue, Are signs she works her sorcery through; Weird, wizard characters she weaves Her spells with under forest leaves,â These wait her word, like imps, upon The gray flag-pods; their wings, of lawn And gauze; their bodies, gleaming green. While o'er the wet sand,âleft between The running water and the still,â In pansy hues and daffodil, The fancies that she doth devise Assume the forms of butterflies, Rich-colored.âAnd 't is she you hear, Whose sleepy rune, hummed in the ear Of silence, bees and beetles purr, And the dry-droning locusts whirr; Till, where the wood is very lone, Vague monotone meets monotone, And Slumber is begot and born, A faery child beneath the thorn. There is no mortal who may scorn The witchery she spreads around Her dim demesne, wherein is bound The beauty of abandoned time, As some sweet thought 'twixt rhyme and rhyme. And through her spells you shall behold The blue turn gray, the gray turn gold Of hollow heaven; and the brown Of twilight vistas twinkled down With fireflies; and in the gloom Feel the cool vowels of perfume Slow-syllabled of weed and bloom. But, in the night, at languid rest,â When like a spirit's naked breast The moon slips from a silver mist,â With star-bound brow, and star-wreathed wrist, If you should see her rise and wave You welcomeâah! what thing could save You then? forevermore her slave! MAY The golden discs of the rattlesnake-weed, That spangle the woods and danceâ No gleam of gold that the twilights hold Is strong as their necromance: For, under the oaks where the woodpaths lead, The golden discs of the rattlesnake-weed Are the May's own utterance. The azure stars of the bluet bloom, That sprinkle the woodland's tranceâ No blink of blue that a cloud lets through Is sweet as their countenance: For, over the knolls that the woods perfume, The azure stars of the bluet bloom Are the light of the May's own glance. With her wondering words and her looks she comes, In a sunbeam of a gown; She needs but think and the blossoms wink, But look, and they shower down. By orchard ways, where the wild bee hums, With her wondering words and her looks she comes Like a little maid to town. RAIN I Around, the stillness deepened; then the grain Went wild with wind; and every briery lane Was swept with dust; and then, tempestuous black, Hillward the tempest heaved a monster back, That on the thunder leaned as on a cane; And on huge shoulders bore a cloudy pack, That gullied gold from many a lightning crack: One great drop splashed and wrinkled down the pane, And then field, hill, and wood were lost in rain. II At last, through clouds,âas from a cavern hewn Into night's heart,âthe sun burst, angry roon; And every cedar, with its weight of wet, Against the sunset's fiery splendor set, Startled to beauty, seemed with rubies strewn: Then in drenched gardens, like sweet phantoms met, Dim odors rose of pink and mignonette; And in the east a confidence, that soon Grew to the calm assurance of the moon. FALL Sad-hearted Spirit of the solitudes, Who comest through the ruin-wedded woods! Gray-gowned in fog, gold-girdled with the gloom Of tawny sunsets; burdened with perfume Of rain-wet uplands, chilly with the mist; And all the beauty of the fire-kissed Cold forests crimsoning thy indolent way, Odorous of death and drowsy with decay. I think of thee as seated 'mid the showers Of languid leaves that cover up the flowers,â The little flower-sisterhoods, whom June Once gave wild sweetness to, as to a tune A singer gives her soul's wild melody,â Watching the squirrel store his granary. Or, 'mid old orchards, I have pictured thee: Thy hair's profusion blown about thy back; One lovely shoulder bathed with gypsy black; Upon thy palm one nestling cheek, and sweet The rosy russets tumbled at thy feet. Was it a voice lamenting for the flowers? Or heart-sick bird that sang of happier hours? A cricket dirging days that soon must die? Or did the ghost of Summer wander by? SUNSET IN AUTUMN Blood-colored oaks, that stand against a sky of gold and brass; Gaunt slopes, on which the bleak leaves glow of brier and sassafras, And broom-sedge strips of smoky pink and pearl-gray clumps of grass In which, beneath the ragged sky, the rain pools gleam like glass. From west to east, from wood to wood, along the forest-side, The winds,âthe sowers of the Lord,âwith thunderous footsteps stride; Their stormy hands rain acorns down; and mad leaves, wildly dyed, Like tatters of their rushing cloaks, stream round them far and wide. The frail leaf-cricket in the weeds sounds its far fairy-bell; And like a torch of phantom ray the milkweed's windy shell Glimmers; while, wrapped in withered dreams, the wet, autumnal smell Of loam and leaf, like Fall's own ghost, steals over field and dell. The oaks, against a copper skyâo'er which, like some black lake Of Dis, bronze clouds, (like surges fringed with sullen fire) breakâ Loom sombre as Doom's citadel above the vales that make A pathway to a land of mist the moon's pale feet shall take. Now, dyed with burning carbuncle, a limbolitten pane, Red in wild walls of storm, the west opens to hill and plain, On which the wild-geese ink themselves, a far triangled train; And then the shuttering clouds close downâand night it comes again. CONTENT When I behold how some pursue Fame that is Care's embodiment, Or fortune, whose false face looks true,â An humble home with sweet content Is all I ask for me and you. An humble home, where pigeons coo, Whose path leads under breezy lines Of frosty-berried cedars to A gate, one mass of trumpet-vines, Is all I ask for me and you. A garden, which, all summer through, The roses old make redolent, And morning-glories, gay of hue, And tansy with its homely scent, Is all I ask for me and you. An orchard, that the pippins strew, From whose bruised gold the juices spring; A vineyard, where the grapes hang blue, Wine-big and ripe for vintaging, Is all I ask for me and you. A lane, that leads to some far view Of forest or of fallow-land, Bloomed o'er of rose and meadow-rue, Each with a bee in its hot hand, Is all I ask for me and you. At morn, a pathway deep with dew, And birds that vary time and tune; At eve, a sunset avenue, And whippoorwills that haunt the moon, Is all I ask for me and you. Dear heart, with wants so small and few, And faith, that 's better far than gold, A lowly friend; a child or two, To care for us when we are old, Is all I ask for me and you. OCTOBER Long hosts of sunlight, and the bright wind blows A tourney-trumpet on the listed hill; Past is the splendor of the royal rose And duchess daffodil. Crowned queen of beauty, in the garden's space, Strong daughter of a bitter race and bold, A ragged beggar with a lovely face, Reigns the sad marigold. And I, who sought June's butterfly for days, Now find itâlike a coreopsis bloomâ Amber and seal, rain-murdered 'neath the blaze Of this sunflower's plume. Here drones the bee; and there, sky-voyaging wings Dare the blue gulfs of heaven: the last song The red-bird flings me as adieu, still rings Upon that pear-tree's prong. No angry sunset brims with rubier red The bowl of heaven than the days, indeed, Pour in the blossoms of this salvia-bed Where each leaf seems to bleed. And where the wood-gnats dance, a little mist, Above the efforts of the weedy stream, The girl, October, tired of the tryst, Dreams a diviner dream. One foot just dipping the caressing wave, One knee at languid angle; locks that drown Hands nut-stained; hazel-eyed, she lies, and grave, Watching the leaves drift down. DISCOVERY What is it now that I shall seek Where woods dip downward, in the hills?â A mossy nook, a ferny creek, And May among the daffodils. Or in the valley's vistaed glow, Past rocks of terraced trumpet-vines, Shall I behold her coming slow, Sweet May, among the columbines? With red-bud cheeks and bluet eyes, Big eyes, the homes of happiness, To meet me with the old surprise, Her hoiden hair all bonnetless. Who waits for me, where, note for note, The birds make glad the forest trees? A dogwood blossom at her throat, My May among th' anemones. As sweetheart breezes kiss the blooms, And dewdrops drink the moon's bright beams, My soul shall kiss her lips' perfumes, And drain the magic of her dreams. THE OLD SPRING I Under rocks whereon the rose Like a strip of morning glows; Where the azure-throated newt Drowses on the twisted root; And the brown bees, humming homeward, Stop to suck the honeydew; Fern and leaf-hid gleaming gloamward, Drips the wildwood spring I knew, Drips the spring my boyhood knew. II Myrrh and music everywhere Haunt its cascadesâlike the hair That a Naiad tosses cool, Swimming strangely beautiful, With white fragrance for her bosom, And her mouth a breath of song:â Under leaf and branch and blossom Flows the woodland spring along, Sparkling, singing flows along. III Still the wet wan mornings touch Its gray rocks, perhaps; and such Slender stars as dusk may have Pierce the rose that roofs its wave; Still the thrush may call at noontide And the whippoorwill at night; Nevermore, by sun or moontide, Shall I see it gliding white, Falling, flowing, wild and white. THE FOREST SPRING Push back the brambles, berry-blue; The hollowed spring is full in view: Deep-tangled with luxuriant fern Ripples its rock-embedded urn. Not for the loneliness that keeps The coigne wherein its crystal sleeps; Not for wild butterflies that sway Their pansy pinions all the day Above its mirror; nor the bee, Nor dragon-fly, that, passing, see Themselves reflected in its spar; Not for the one white liquid star That twinkles in its firmament; Nor moon-shot clouds, so slowly sent Athwart it when the kindly night Beads its long grasses with the light Small jewels of the dimpled dew: Not for the day's inverted blue, Nor the quaint, dimly colored stones That dance within it where it moans; Not for all these I love to sit In silence and to gaze in it. But, lo! a nymph with merry eyes Greets mine within its laughing skies; A glimmering, shimmering nymph who plays All the long fragrant summer days With instant sights of bees and birds, And talks with them in water-words; And for whose nakedness the air Weaves moony mists; and on whose hair, Unfilleted, the night will set That lone star as a coronet. THE HILLS There is no joy of earth that thrills My bosom like the far-off hills! Th' unchanging hills, that, shadowy, Beckon our mutability To follow and to gaze upon Foundations of the dusk and dawn. Meseems the very heavens are massed Upon their shoulders, vague and vast With all the skyey burden of The winds and clouds and stars above. Lo, how they sit before us, seeing The laws that give all Beauty being! Behold! to them, when dawn draws near, The nomads of the air appear, Unfolding crimson camps of day In brilliant bands; then march away; And under burning battlements Of evening plant their tinted tents. The truth of olden myths, that brood By haunted stream and haunted wood, They see; and feel the happiness Of old at which we only guess: The dreams, the ancients loved and knew, Still as their rocks and trees are true: Not otherwise than presences The tempest and the calm to these: One, shouting on them all the night, Black-limbed and veined with lambent light: The other, with the ministry Of all soft things that company With musicâwhose embodied form Fills all the solitude with charm Of leaves and waters and the peace Of bird-begotten melodiesâ And who at night doth still confer With the mild moon, that telleth her Pale tale of lonely love, until Wan shadows of her passion fill The heights with shapes that glimmer by Clad on with sleep and memory. THE SONG OF THE THRUSH Overhead, overhead a wood thrush flutes, And it seems to me All the sweet words in the world, Married to melody, could not express What its few, wild notes, Inspired, and simple, and free, express, Say to me Of expectation and woodland mystery, Dreams, and wonder-visions never appearing, Remote and unattainably beautifulâ O indescribable song! Song of the wild brown thrush! O June! O love! O youth! Of you, of you it speaks to me! Of the lost, the irremediable, The indescribably fair and far and yet to be found; The mysteriously hidden, too: The lure of the undiscoverable calling, calling, Bidding me on and on, In the voice of all my longings, Down the dim, the deep, the cadenced aisles of the forest. TRANSMUTATION To me all beauty that I see Is melody made visible: An earth-translated state, may be, Of music heard in Heaven or Hell. Out of some love-impassioned strain Of saints, the rose evolved its bloom; And, dreaming of it here again, Perhaps relives it as perfume. Out of some chant, that demons sing Of hate and pain, the sunset grew; And, haply, still remembering, Relives it here as some wild hue. FROST Magician he, who, autumn nights, Down from the starry darkness whirls; Heav'n's harlequin, whose spangled tights And wand are powdered thick with pearls. Through him each pane presents a scene, A Lilliputian landscape, where The world is white instead of green, And trees and houses hang in air. Where Elfins gambol and delight, And bow the jewelled bells of flowers; Where upside-down we see the night With many moons and meteor showers. And surely in his wand and hand Lies Midas magic, for, behold, Some morn we wake and find the land, Both field and forest, turned to gold. ADVENTURERS Seemingly over the hilltops, Possibly under the hills, A tireless wing that never drops, And a song that never stills. Epics heard on the stars' lips? Lyrics read in the dew?â To sing the song at our finger-tips, And live the world anew! Cavaliers of the CortÃ©s kind, Bold and free and strong,â And, oh, for a fine and muscular mind To sing a New-World's song! Sailing seas of the silver morn, Blown of its balm and spice, To put the Old-World art to scorn At the price of any price! Danger, death, but the hope high! God's, though the purpose fail!â Into the deeds of a vaster sky Sailing a dauntless sail. INVOCATION I O Life! O Death; O God! Have we not striven? Have we not known Thee, God, As Thy stars know Heaven? Have we not held Thee true, True as Thy deepest, Sweet and immaculate blue Heaven whence rains Thy dew! Have we not known Thee true, O God who keepest! II O God, our Father, God!â Who gav'st us fire, To rise above the sod, To soar, aspireâ What though we strive and strive, And all our soul says âliveâ? Will not the scorn of men, Like some wild bird, again Falcon it down with sneers, As often in past years? And, O sun-centered high, Thou, too, who 'rt Poet, Beneath Thy seeing sky Each day new Keatses die, Crying, âWhy should we try! That which we seek 's a lie!ââ Why is this so?âO why?â Thou who dost know it! III We know Thee beautiful, We know Thee bitter! Help Thou!âMen's eyes are dull, O God most beautiful! Make Thou their souls less full Of things mere glitter. Dost Thou not see our tears? Dost Thou not hear the years Treading our hearts to shards, O Lord of all the Lords?â Give heed, O God of Hosts, There 'mid Thy glorious ghosts, Most high and holy! Have mercy on our tears! Have mercy on our years! Our strivings and our fears, O Lord of lordly peers, On us, so lowly! IV On us, so fondly fain To tell what mother-pain Of Nature haunts the rain. On us, so glad to show What sorrow wings the snow, And her wild winds that blow. Us, who interpret right Her mystic rose of light, Her moony rune of night. Us, who have utterance for Each warm, flame-hearted star That stammers from afar. Who hear the tears and sighs Of every bud that dies While heav'n's dew on it lies. Who see the power that dowers The wildwood bosks and bowers With musk and sap of flowers. Who see what no man sees In water, earth and breeze, And in the hearts of trees. Turn not away Thy light, O God!âOur strength is slight! Help us who breast the height! Have mercy, Infinite! Have mercy! THE DEATH OF LOVE So Love is dead, the Love we knew of old! And in the sorrow of our heart's hushed halls A lute lies broken and a rose-flower falls; Love's house stands empty and his hearth lies cold. Lone in dim places, where sweet vows were told, In walks grown desolate, by ruined walls Beauty decays; and on their pedestals Dreams crumble, and th' immortal gods are mold. Music is slain or sleeps; one voice alone, One voice awakes, and like a wandering ghost Haunts all the echoing chambers of the Pastâ The voice of Memory, that stills to stone The soul that hears; the mind, that, utterly lost, Before its beautiful presence stands aghast. UNANSWERED How long ago it is since we went Maying! Since she and I went Maying long ago! The years have left my forehead lined, I know, Have thinned my hair around the temples graying. Ah, time will change us: yea, I hear it sayingâ âShe, too, grows old: the face of rose and snow Has lost its freshness: in the hair's brown glow Some strands of silver sadly, too, are straying. The form you knew, whose beauty so enspelled, Has lost the litheness of its loveliness: And all the gladness that her blue eyes held Tears and the world have hardened with distress.ââ âTrue! true!â I answer, âO ye years that part! These things are changedâbut is her heart, her heart?â LOVE, THE INTERPRETER Thou art the music that I hear in sleep, The poetry that lures me on in dreams; The magic, thou, that holds my thought with themes Of young romance in revery's mystic keep.â The lily's aura, and the damask deep That clothes the rose; the whispering soul that seems To haunt the wind; the rainbow light that streams, Like some wild spirit, 'thwart the cataract's leapâ Are glimmerings of thee and thy loveliness, Pervading all my world; interpreting The marvel and the wonder these disclose: For, lacking thee, to me were meaningless Life, love, and hope, the joy of everything, And all the beauty that the wide world knows. LOVE DESPISED Why not resolve and hunt it from one's heart? This love, this god and fiend, that makes a hell Of all one's life, in ways no tongue can tell, No mind divine, nor any word impart. Would not one think the slights that make hearts smart, The ice of love's disdain, the wintry well Of love's disfavor, otherwise would quell? Or school one's nature, too, to its own art? Why will men cringe and cry forever here For that which, once obtained, may prove a curse? Why not remember that, however fair, Decay is wed to Beauty? that each year Robs somewhat from the riches of her purse, Until at last her house of pride stands bare? PEARLS Baroque, but beautiful, between the lunes, The valves of nacre of a mussel-shell, Behold, a pearl! shaped like the burnished bell Of some strange blossom that long afternoons Of summer coax to open: all the moon's Chaste lustre in it; hues that only dwell With purity. . . . It takes me, like a spell, Back to a day when, whistling truant tunes, A barefoot boy I waded 'mid the rocks, Searching for shells strewn in the creek's slow swirl, Unconscious of the pearls that round me lay: While, 'mid wild-roses,âall her tomboy locks Blond-blowing,âstood, unnoticed then, a girl, My sweetheart once, the pearl I flung away. THE WOMAN SPEAKS Why have you come?âTo see me in my shame? A thing to spit upon, despise and scorn?â You, you who ask me! You, by whom was torn, Then cast aside, like some vile rag, my name! What shelter could you give me, now, that blame And loathing would not share? that wolves of vice Would not besiege with eyes of glaring ice? Wherein Sin sat not with her face of flame? âYou love meâ?âGod!âIf yours be love, for lust Hell must invent another synonym! If yours be love, then whoredom is the way To Heaven and God! and not with soul but dust Must burn the faces of the Cherubim,â O beast of beasts, if yours be love, I say! OF THE SLUMS Red-faced as old carousal, and with eyes A hard, hot blue; her hair a frowsy flame, Bold, dowdy bosomed, from her window-frame She leans, her mouth all insult and all lies. Or slattern-slippered and in sluttish gown, With ribald mirth and words too vile to name, A new Doll Tearsheet, glorying in her shame, Armed with her Falstaff now she takes the town. The flaring lights of alley-way saloons, The reek of hideous gutters and black oaths Of drunkenness from vice-infested dens, Are to her senses what the silvery moon's Chaste splendor is, and what the blossoming growths Of Earth and bird-song are to Innocence. LIGHT AND WIND Where, through the myriad leaves of many trees, The daylight falls, beryl and chrysoprase, The glamour and the glimmer of its rays Seem visible music, tangible melodies: Light that is music; music that one seesâ Wagnerian musicâwhere forever sways The spirit of romance, and gods and fays Take form, clad on with dreams and mysteries. And now the wind's transmuting necromance Touches the light and makes it fall and rise, Vocal, a harp of multitudinous waves That speaks as ocean speaksâan utterance Of far-off whispers, mermaid-murmuring sighsâ Pelagian, vast, deep down in coral caves. THE WINDS Those hewers of the clouds, the Winds,âthat lair At the four compass-points,âare out to-night; I hear their sandals trample on the height, I hear their voices trumpet through the air: Builders of Storm, God's workmen, now they bear, Up the steep stair of sky, on backs of might, Huge tempest bulks, while,âsweat that blinds their sight,â The rain is shaken from tumultuous hair: Now, sweepers of the firmament, they broom, Like gathered dust, the rolling mists along Heaven's floors of sapphire; all the beautiful blue Of skyey corridor and aÃ«ry room Preparing, with large laughter and loud song, For the white moon and stars to wander through. TOUCHES In heavens of rivered blue, that sunset dyes With glaucous flame, deep in the west the day Stands Midas-like; or, wading on his way, Touches with splendor all the twilight skies. Each cloud that, like a stepping-stone, he tries With rosy foot, transforms its sober gray To blazing gold; while, ray on crystal ray, Within his wake the stars like bubbles rise. So should the artist in his work accord All things with beauty, and communicate His soul's high magic and divinity To all he does; and, hoping no reward, Toil onward, making darkness aureate With light of worlds that be and are to be. EARTH AND MOON I saw the day like some great monarch die, Gold-couched, behind the clouds' rich tapestries. Then, purple-sandaled, clothed in silences Of sleep, through halls of skyey lazuli, The twilight, like a mourning queen, trailed by, Dim-paged of dreams and shadowy mysteries; And now the night, the star-robed child of these, In meditative loveliness draws nigh. Earth,âlike to Romeo,âdeep in dew and scent, Beneath Heaven's window, watching till a light, Like some white blossom, in its square be set,â Lifts a faint face unto the firmament, That, with the moon, grows gradually bright, Bidding him climb and clasp his Juliet. DUSK Corn-colored clouds upon a sky of gold, And 'mid their sheaves,âwhere, like a daisy-bloom Left by the reapers to the gathering gloom, The star of twilight flames,âas Ruth, 't is told, Dreamed homesick 'mid the harvest fields of old, The Dusk goes gleaning color and perfume From Bible slopes of heaven, that illume Her pensive beauty deep in shadows stoled. Hushed is the forest; and blue vale and hill Are still, save for the brooklet, sleepily Stumbling the stone with one foam-fluttering foot: Save for the note of one far whippoorwill, And in my heart her name,âlike some sweet bee Within a rose,âblowing a fairy flute. SEPTEMBER The bubbled blue of morning-glory spires, Balloon-blown foam of moonflowers, and sweet snows Of clematis, through which September goes, Song-hearted, rich in realized desires, Are flanked with hotter hues: with tawny fires Of acrid marigolds,âthat light long rows Of lamps,âand salvias, red as day's red close,â That torches seem,âby which the Month attires Barbaric beauty; like some Asian queen, Towering imperial in her two-fold crown Of harvest and of vintage; all her form Gold and majestic purple: in her mien The might of motherhood; her baby brown, Abundance, high on one exultant arm. THE END OF SUMMER Pods are the poppies, and slim spires of pods The hollyhocks; the balsam's pearly bredes Of rose-stained snow are little sacs of seeds Collapsing at a touch; the lote, that sods The pond with green, has changed its flowers to rods And discs of vesicles; and all the weeds, Around the sleepy water and its reeds, Are one white smoke of seeded silk that nods. Summer is dead, ay me! sweet Summer 's dead! The sunset clouds have built her funeral pyre, Through which, e'en now, runs subterranean fire: While from the East, as from a garden-bed, Mist-vined, the Dusk lifts her broad moonâlike some Great golden melonâsaying, âFall has come.â THE PASSING GLORY Slow sinks the sun,âa great carbuncle ball Red in the cavern of a sombre cloud,â And in her garden, where the dense weeds crowd, Among her dying asters stands the Fall, Like some lone woman in a ruined hall, Dreaming of desolation and the shroud; Or through decaying woodlands goes, down-bowed, Hugging the tatters of her gipsy shawl. The gaunt wind rises, like an angry hand, And sweeps the sprawling spider from its web, Smites frantic music in the twilight's ear; And all around, like melancholy sand, Rains dead leaves downâwild leaves, that mark the ebb, In Earth's dark hour-glass, of another year. PROTOTYPES Whether it be that we in letters trace The pure exactness of a woodbird's strain, And name it song; or with the brush attain The high perfection of a wildflower's face; Or mold in difficult marble all the grace We know as man; or from the wind and rain Catch elemental rapture of refrain And mark in music to due time and place: The aim of art is Nature; to unfold Her truth and beauty to the souls of men In close suggestions; in whose forms is cast Nothing so new but 't is long eons old; Nothing so old but 't is as young as when The mind conceived it in the ages past. SUPERSTITION In the waste places, in the sinister night, When the wood whispers like a wandering mind, And silence sits and listens to the wind, Or, 'mid the rocks, to some wild torrent's flight; Bat-browed thou wadest with thy wisp of light Among black pools the moon can never find; Or, owlet-eyed, thou hootest to the blind Deep darkness from some cave or haunted height. He who beholds but once thy fearsome face, Never again shall walk alone! but wan And terrible attendants shall be hisâ Unutterable things that have no place In God or Beautyâthat compel him on, Against all hope, where endless horror is. A. D. NINETEEN HUNDRED War and Disaster, Famine and Pestilence, Vaunt-couriers of the Century that comes, Behold them shaking their tremendous plumes Above the world! Lo, all the air grows dense With rumors of destruction and a sense, Cadaverous, of corpses and of tombs Predestined; while,âlike monsters in the glooms,â Bristling with battle, shadowy and immense, The Nations rise in dread apocalypse.â Where now the boast Earth makes of civilization? Its brag of Christianity?âIn vain We seek to see them in the wild eclipse Of hell and horror and the devastation Of Death triumphant on his hills of slain. UNCALLED As one, who, journeying westward with the sun, Beholds at length from the up-towering hills, Far-off, a land unspeakable beauty fills, CirceÃ¤n peaks and vales of Avalon: And, sinking weary, watches, one by one, The big seas beat between; and knows it skills No more to try; that now, as Heaven wills, This is the helpless end, that all is done: So 't is with him, whom long a vision led In quest of Beautyâand who finds at last, She lies beyond his effort; all the waves Of all the world between them: while the dead, The myriad dead, who populate the Past With failure, hail him from forgotten graves. QUATRAINS I Moths and Fireflies Since Fancy taught me in her school of spells I know her tricks: These are not moths at all, Nor fireflies; but masking Elfland belles Whose link-boys torch them to Titania's ball. II Autumn Wildflowers Like colored lanterns swung in Elfin towers, Wild morning-glories light the tangled ways, And, like the rosy rockets of the Fays, Burns the sloped crimson of the cardinal-flowers. III The Wind in the Pines When winds go organing through the pines On hill and headland, darkly gleaming, Meseems I hear sonorous lines Of Iliads that the woods are dreaming. IV Opportunity Behold a hag whom Life denies a kiss As he rides questward in knighterrant-wise; Only when he hath passed her is it his To know, too late, the Fairy in disguise. V Dreams They mock the present and they haunt the past, And in the future there is naught agleam With hope, the soul desires, that at last The heart, pursuing, does not find a dream. AFTERWORD What vague traditions do the golden eves, What legends do the dawns Inscribe in fire on Heaven's azure leaves, The red sun colophons? What ancient stories do the waters verse? What tales of war and love Do winds within the Earth's vast house rehearse, God's stars stand guard above? Would I could know them as they are expressed In hue and melody! And say, in words, the beauties they suggest, Language their mystery! And in one song magnificently rise, The music of the spheres, That more than marble should immortalize My name in after years.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Volume IV POEMS OF MYSTERY AND OF MYTH AND ROMANCE [POEMS OF MYSTERY] PROEM Not while I live may I forget That garden which my spirit trod! Where dreams were flowers, wild and wet, And beautiful as God. Not while I breathe, awake, adream, Shall live again for me those hours, When, in its mystery and gleam, I met her 'mid the flowers. Eyes, talismanic heliotrope, Beneath mesmeric lashes, where The sorceries of love and hope Had made a shining lair. And daydawn brows, whereover hung The twilight of dark loves; wild birds, Her lips, that spoke the rose's tongue In fragrance-voweled words. I will not speak of cheeks and chin, That held me as sweet language holds; Nor of the eloquence within Her breasts' twin-moonÃ©d molds. Nor of her body's languorous Wind-grace, that glanced like starlight through Her clinging robe's diaphanous Web of the mist and dew. There is no star so pure and high As was her look; no fragrance such As her soft presence; and no sigh Of music like her touch. Not while I live may I forget That garden of dim dreams, where I And Song within the spirit met, Sweet Song, who passed me by. HAUNTED I Without a moon when night comes on There is a sighing in its trees As of sad lips that no one sees; And the far-dwindling forest, large Beyond fenced fields, seems shadowy drawn Into its shadows. Faint and wan, By the wistariaed portico Stealing, I go Through gardens where the weeds are rank: Where, here and there, in clump and bank, SpirÃ¦as rise, whose dotted blooms Seem clustered starlight; and the four Syringas sweet heap, powdered o'er, Thin flower-beakers of perfumes; And the dead flowering-almond tree, That once was pink as her young cheek, Now withered leans within the glooms.â Why must I walk here? seek and seek Her, long since gone?âStill bower on bower The roses climb in blushing flower.â Ah, 'mid the roses could I see Her eyes, her sad eyes, shine like flowers, Or like the dew that lies for hours Within their hearts, then it might be I might find comfort here, although Wistful, as if reproaching me, Her sad eyes look, saying what none may know. II When midnight comes it brings a moon: A scent is strewn Of honey and wild-thorns broadcast Beneath the stars. When I have passed Under dark cedars, solemn pines, Through dodder-drowned petunias, Corn-flower and the columbine, To where azaleas, choked with grass, And peonies, like great wisps, shine, I reach banked honeysuckle vines, Piled deep and trammeled with the gourd And morning-gloryâone wild hoard Of rich aromaâwhere the seat, The rustic bench, where oft we sat,â Now warped and old with rain and heat,â Still stands upon its mossy mat: And here I rest; and thenâa word I seem to hear; A soft word whispered in my ear; Her voice it seems; no thing is near; I look around:âI have but heard The plaintive note of some lost bird Trickle through night,âawakened where, 'Neath its thick lair of twisted twigs, The jarring and incessant grigs Hum:âdream-drugged so, the haunted air Makes all my soul as heavy as Dew-poppied grass. III Once when the moon rose, fair and full,â Like some sea-seen Hesperian pool, A splash of gold through tangling trees,â Or like the Island beautiful Of Avalon in haunted seas,â There came a sighing in the trees As of sad lips; there was no breeze, And yet sad sighings shook the trees. And when, all in a mystic space, Her orb swam, amiable white, Right in that shattered casement, by The broken porch the creepers lace, Born of a moonbeam and a sigh, I saw her face, Pale through a mist of tears; so slight, So immaterial, ah me! In pensiveness, and vanished grace, 'Twas like an olden melody. IV I know long-angled on its floors, Where windows face the anxious east, The moonshine pours White squares of glitter and, at least, Gives glimmer to its whispering halls: Its corridors, Sleep-tapestried, are guled with bars Of moonlight: by its wasted walls Crouch shadows: and,âwhere streaked dusts lay Their undisturbed, deep gray Upon its stairs,âdim, vision-footed, glide Faint gossamer gleams, like visible sighs, As to and fro, athwart the skies,â Wind-swung against the moon outside,â The twisted branches sway Of one great tree; I stand below, And listen now, Hearing a murmur come and go Through its gnarled boughs; remembering how Shady this chestnut made her room, And sweet, in June, with plumes of bloom; And how the broad and gusty flues Of the old house sang when the rain let loose Its winds, and each flue seemed a hoarse, Sonorous throat, filled with the storm's wild boom, And growled carousal; goblin tunes The hylas pipe to rainy moons Of March; or, in the afternoons Of summer, singing in their course,â Where blossoms drip,âall wet of back,â The crickets drone in avenues Of locusts leading to the gate. And in the dark here where I wait Meseems I hear the silence creep And crepitate From hall to hall; as one in sleep I hear, yet hear not; feel that there Her soul walks, waking on each stair Strange echoes; and the stealthy crack Of old and warping floors: I seem To follow her; and in a dream To see, yet see not; in the black That drapes each room, my mind informs With shapes, that hide behind each door And fling from closets phantom arms. V I see her face, as once before, Bewildered with its terror, pressed To the dark, polished floor; distressed, Clasped in her blind and covering hands; So desolate with anguish, wrenched With wild remorse, no man could see, Could see and turn away like me, No man that sees and understands Love and its mortal agony. Again, like some automaton, Part of that ghostly tragedy, Myself I see, the fool who fled, Who sneered and fled. And then again Came stealing back. Again, with blenched And bending face I stand, and clenched And icy hands, and staring eyes, Looking upon her face, as wan As water; eyes all wide with pain; Cramped to dilation, packed with loss: Again I seem to lean across The years, and hear my heart's deep groan Above the young gold of her head, Above that huddled heap alone,â Her, white and dead. VI Yes, there is moan Of lamentation and hushed screams In all its crannies; and sad shades Haunt all its rooms, the moonlight braids, With melancholy. Slow have flown The weary years: and I have known An anguish and remorse far worse Than usual life's; and live, it seems, Because to live is but a curse. . . . VII There she lies buried; there! that ground Gated with rusty iron, where She and her stanch forefathers sleep; So old, the turf scarce shows a mound; So gray, you scarce distinguish there A headstone where the ivies creep And myrtles bloom. A wall of stone Squares it around; a place for dreams; A mossy spot of sorrow;âlone, Nay, lonelier, wilder now it seems, Though just the same: its roses waste Their petals there as oft of yore; Their placid petals, as before; Pale, pensive petals: yonder some Lie faint as puffs of foam Within the moonlight, dimly traced Beneath the boughs; some few are strown On the usurping weeds, great grown Around her tomb, on which two dead leaves lie. . . . Here let my sick heart break and die Amid their wiltings, on her grave, Here in her dim, old burying-ground The druid cedars guard around And roses and wild thorns. Alone She shall not lie! Ah, let me moan My life out here where rose-leaves fall, And rest by her who was my all! THE ELIXIR OF LOVE He held it possible that he Who idolizes one that's dead, With that strange liquid instantly Might raise them, living red: And so he thought, â'Tis mine at last To live and love the love that's past; The joy without the grief and pain. The dead shall live and love again.â For he had loved one till for him Her face had grown his spirit-part: Though dead, she seemed to him less dim Than men in street and mart. He labored on; for, truth to say, In toil alone his pleasure lay, His art, through which, sometime, he thought, Back to his arms she would be brought. He kept such trysts as phantoms keep, Pale distances about his soul; And moved like one who walks asleep, Attaining no sure goal: Yet blither than a younger heart At crucible and glass retort He labored; for his love was prism To irisate toil's egoism. He drained wan draughts from out a cup, A globe of vague and flaming gold, Held from the darkness, brimming up, By something white and cold, That wreathed faint fingers round its brim, Slim flakes of foam; and, soft and dim, Stooped out of fiery-bound abysses To print his brow with icy kisses. At last within his trembling hand An ancient flask burnt, starry rose; A liquid flame of ruby fanned, Heart-like, with crimson throes: And in the liquid, like a flower, A starlike face bloomed for an hour, Then slowly faded to a skull With eyes that mocked the beautiful. 'Though all his life had been so strange, Yet stranger now it seemed to be;â What was it led him forth to range 'Mid graves and mystery? What led him to that one, dim tomb, Where he could read within the gloom The name of one who lay within With all of silence, naught of sin? Untainted, so it seemed, and made By death's cold kisses still more fair, He found her; raised her; softly laid Her raven depths of hair Upon his shoulder: and the pearls, Around her neck and in her curls, Less pale were than the kingly calm Upon his face that showed no qualm. And through the night, beneath the moon, Across the windy hill, the gloom Of forests where the leaves lay strewn, He brought her to his room: And in the awfulness of death, That filled her wide eyes with its breath, He set her in a carven chair Where the still moon could kiss her hair. One moment then he paused to think: Then to her lips, all drawn and dead, His strange elixir pressed andââDrink! Drink life and love!â he said. And itâit drank; the dead drank slow: And in its eyes there came a glow: Yet still as stone its body sate, With eyes of hell and lips of hate. Still as fall-frozen ice its face, And thin its voice as drizzled rain, When in its rotting silk and lace It rose and lived again: Its bosom moved not while it spake; Nor moved its lips; and half awake Its eyes seemed with enchanted sleep A century long in night's old keep. And, stooping o'er, it whispered lowâ A sound like a vibrating wire, Or like the hiss of falling snow In flutterings faint of fire:â âIn me, behold, you see your toil! In me your love! A thing to coil Around your life thus!âMake entire!â The demon of your dead desire!â And where, before, was quietness, Was violence of hate and evilâ Yet all its form seemed passionless, A corpse that held a devil! . . . But who shall say the hands were its That made within his throat these pits?â They found him dead; and by him, one Who clasped him close, a skeleton. GLORAMONE The moonbeams on the hollies glow Pale where she left me; and the snow Lies bleak in moonshine on the graves, Ribbed with each gust that shakes and waves Ancestral cedars by her tomb. . . . She lay so beautiful in death, My Gloramone,âwhose loveliness Death had not dimmed with all its doom,â That, urged by my divine distress, I sought her sepulchre: the gloom, The iciness that takes the breath, The sense of fear, were not too strong To keep me from beholding long. I stole into its sorrow; burst, With what I know was hand accursed, Its seal, the gated silence of Her old armorial tomb: but love Had sighed sweet romance to my heart; And here, I thought, another part Our souls would play. I did not start When indistinctness of pale lips Breathed on my hair; faint finger-tips Fluttered their starlight on my brow; When on my eyes, I knew not whence, Vague kisses fell: then, like a vow, Within my heart, an aching sense Of vampire winning. And I heard Her name slow-syllabledâa word Of haunting harmonyâand then Low-whispered, âThou! at last, 'tis thou!â And sighs of shadowy lips again. How madly strange that this should be! For, had she loved me here on Earth, It had not then been marvelous That she should now remember me, Returning love for love, though worth Less, yes, far less to both of us. And so I wondered, listening there: How was it that her soul was brought So near to mine now, whom in life She hated so? And everywhere About my life I thought and thought And found no reason why her love Should now be mine. We were at strife Forever here; her hatred drove Me to despair: I cast my glove Into the frowning face of fate, And lost her. Yea, it was her hate That made her Appolonio's wife. Her hate! her lovely hate!âfor of Her naught I found unlovely;âand I felt she did not understand My passion, and 'twere well to wait. And now I felt her presence near, I, full of life; yet knew no fear There in the sombre silence, mark. And it was dark, yes, deadly dark: But when I slowly drew away The pall, death modeled with her face,â From her fair form it fell and lay Rich in the dust,âthe shrouded place Was glittering daggered by the spark Of one wild ruby at her throat, Red-arrowed as a star with throbs Of pulsing flame. And note on note The night seemed filled with tenuous sobs Of fire that flickered from that stone, That, lustrous, lay against her throat, Large as her eyes, and shadowy. And standing by the dead alone I marveled not that this should be. The essence of an hundred stars, Of fretful crimson, through and through Its bezels beat, when, bending down My hot lips pressed her mouth. And scars, Aurora-scarlet, veiny blue, Flame-hearted, blurred the midnight; and The vault rang; and I felt a hand Like fire in mine. And, lo, a frown Broke up her face as gently as The surface of a fountain's glass A zephyr moves, that jolts the grass Spilling its rain-drops. When this passed, Through song-soft slumber, binding fast, Slow smiles dreamed outward beautiful; And with each smile I heard the dull Deep music of her heart, and saw, As by some necromantic law, Faint tremblings of a lubric light Flush her white temples and her throat: And each long pulse was as a note, That, gathering, like a strong surprise With all of happiness, made sweet With dim carnation in wild wise The arch of her pale lips, and beat Like moonlight from her head to feet. I bent and kissed her once again: And with that kiss it seemed that pain, Which long had ached beneath her smile And eyelids, vanished. In a while I saw she breathed. Then, wondrous white, Fair as she was before she died, She rose upon the bier; a sight To marvel at, whose truth belied All fiction. Yet I saw her eyes Grow wide unto my kiss,âlike skies Of starless dawn.âAnd all the fire Of that dark ruby at her throat Around her presence seemed to float, A mist of rose, wherein like light She moved, or music exquisite. What followed then I scarcely know: All I remember is, I caught Her hand; and from the tomb I brought Her beautiful: and o'er the snow, Where moonbeams on the hollies glow, I led her. But her feet no print Left of their nakedness, no dint, No faintest trace in frost. I thought, âThe moonlight fills them with its glow, So soft they fall; or 'tis the snow Covers them o'er!âthe tomb was black, Andâthis strong light blinds!ââTurning back My eyes met hers; and as I turned, Flashing centupled facets, burned That ruby at her throat; and I Studied its beauty for a while: How came it there, and when, and why? Who set it at her throat? Again, Was it a ruby?âPondering, I stood and gazed. A far, strange smile Filled all her face, and as with pain I seemed to hear her speak, or sing, These words, that meant not anything, Yet more than any words may mean: âThy blood it is,â she said; then sighed: âSee where thy heart's blood beateth! here Thy heart's blood, that my lips did drain In life; I live by still, unseen, Long as thy passion shall remain.â Canst thou behold and have no fear?â Yea, if I am not dead, 'tis thou!â Look how thy heart's blood flashes now!â Blood of my life and soul, beat on! Beat on! and fill my veins with dawn; And heat the heart of me, his bride!â And then she leaned against me, eyed Like some white serpent, strangely still, That binds one with its glittering stare, That at wild stars hath gazed until Its eyes have learned their golden glare. And then I took her by the wrists And drew her to me. Faintly felt The shadow of her hair, whose mists Were twilight-deep and dimly smelt Of shroud and sepulchre. And she Smiled on me with such sorcery As well might win a soul from God To Hell and torments. And I trod On white enchantments and was long A song and harp-string to a song, Love's battle in my blood. And there, Kissing her mouth, all unaware The ruby loosened at her throat, And, ere I wist, hung o'er my hand, And on the brink I seemed to stand Of something that cried out, âAdmire The beauty of this gem of fire, Its witchcraft and its workmanship.â Then from her throat it seemed to slip, And, in the hollow of my hand, A rosy spasm, a bubble-boat Of living flame, it seemed to float; A fretful fire; a heart, fierce fanned Of red convulsions. Like a brand, A blaze, it touched me; seemed to run Like fever through my pulses, swift, Of torrid poison. One by one, Now burning ice, now freezing sun, I felt my veins swell. Then I felt My palm brim up and overflow With blood that, beads of oozing glow, Dripped, drop by drop, upon the snow, Like holly-berries on the snow. Then something darkly seemed to melt Within me, and I heard a sigh So like a moan, 'twas as if years Of anguish bore it; and the sky Swam near me as when seen through tearsâ And she was gone. . . . In ghostly gloom Of dark, scarred pines a crumbling tomb Loomed like a mist. Carved in its stone, Above the grated portal deep, Glimmered this legend:â âLet her sleep, Crowned with dim death, our lovely one, Known here on Earth as Gloramone. Our hearts bow down by her and weep, And one sits weeping all alone.â THE IMAGE IN THE GLASS I The slow reflection of a woman's face Grew, as by witchcraft, in the oval space Of that strange glass on which the moon looked in:â As cruel as death beneath the auburn hair The dark eyes burned; and, o'er the faultless chin,â Evil as night, yet as the daybreak fair,â Rose-red and sensual smiled the mouth of sin. II The glorious throat and shoulders and, twin crests Of snow, the splendid beauty of the breasts, Filled soul and body with the old desire.â Daughter of darkness! how could this thing be? You, whom I loathed! for whom my heart's fierce fire Had burnt to ashes of satiety! You, who had sunk my soul in crime's red mire! III How came your image there? and in that room! Where she, the all-adored, my life's sweet bloom, Died poisoned! She, my scarcely one week's brideâ Yes, poisoned by a gift you sent to her, Thinking her death would win me to your side. It won me; yes! but. . . . Well, it made some stirâ By your own hand, I think, they said you died. IV Time passed. And thenâwas it the curse of crime, That night of nights, which forced my feet to climb To that locked bridal-room?â'Twas midnight when A longing, like to madness, mastered me, Compelled me to that chamber, which for ten Long years was sealed: a dark necessity To gaze uponâI knew not what again. V Love's ghost, perhaps. Or, in the curvature Of that orbed mirror, something that might cure The ache in meâsome message, said perchance Of her dead loveliness,âwhich once it glassed,â That might repeat again my lost romance In momentary pictures of the past, While in its depths her image swam in trance. VI I did not dream to see the soulless eyes Of you I hated; nor the lips where lies And kisses curled: your features,âthat were tuned To all demonic,âsmiling up as might Some deep damnation! while . . . my God! I swooned! . . . Oozed slowly out, between the breasts' dead white, The ghastly red of that wide dagger-wound. THE LEGEND OF THE STONE The year was dying, and the day Was almost dead; The west, beneath a sombre gray, Was sombre red: The gravestones in the ghostly light, That glimmered there, Seemed phantoms, wandering wan and white, 'Mid trees half bare. I stood beside the grave of one Who, here in life, Was false to me; who had undone My child and wife: I stood beside his grave until The moon came upâ It seemed the dark, unhallowed hill Lifted a cup. No stone was there to mark his grave, No flower to graceâ 'Twas meet that weeds alone should wave In such a place: I stood beside his grave until The stars swam high, And all the night was iron-still From sky to sky. What cared I though strange eyes glowed bright Within the gloom! Though, evil blue, a witch's-light Burnt by each tomb! Or that each crooked thorn-tree seemed A hag, black-cloaked! Or that the owl above me screamed, The raven croaked! I cursed him: cursed him when the day Burnt sullen red; Had cursed him when the west was gray, And day was dead: And now when night made dark the pole, Both soon and late I cursed his body, yea, and soul, With th' hate of hate. Once at my side I seemed to hear A low voice say,â â'Twere better to forgive,âand fear Thy God,âand pray.â I laughed; and from pale lips of stone On sculptured tombs Wild laughter leapt, and then a moan Swept through the glooms. And then I felt a changeâa force, That seemed to seize My body, like some fearful curse, And, fastening, freeze It downward, deeper than the knees, Into the earthâ While still among the twisted trees Rang mocking mirth. And then I felt such fear, despair, As lost ones feel, When, knotted in their pitch-stiff hair, They feel the steel Of devils' forks lift up, through sleet Of Hell's slant fire, Then plunge,âas white from head to feet I grew entire. A voice without me, yet within, As still as frost, Intoned: âThy sin is more than sin, O damned and lost! Behold, how God would punish thee For this thy crimeâ Thy crime of hate and blasphemyâ Through endless time! âO'er him, whom thou wouldst not forgive, Record what good He did on Earth! and let him live Loved, understood! Be memory thine of all the worst He did thine own!â . . . There at the head of him I cursed I stoodâa stone. THE RUINED MILL On the wild South Fork of Harrod's Creek, O'ergrown with creepers, if you should seek, You will find an ancient water-mill Of stone below a wooded hill. Its weedy wheel is not less still Than its image that sleeps in the grassy pool Where the moccasin swims; and, slimly cool Like streaks of light through blurs of sun, The silver minnows and crawfish run. So lone the place, in its sycamore The blue crane builds; and from the shore The shitepoke wanders about its door. The burdock sprawls on its sill of pine; And, in its pathway, eglantine And blackberry tangle and intertwine; Ox-daisies checker with pearl and gold The bushy banks of its mill-race old; The owl in its loft as safely lairs As the fox in its cellar, that whelps and cares Naught for the hunters who gallop by With their baying hounds; the martins fly Around its chimney and build therein; And wasp and hornet, with murmurous din, Plaster their nests, that none disturb, On window-lintel and hopper-curb. Once I stood in this old, stone mill, Once as the day died over the hill, And night came on; and stark and still I met with phantoms upon its stairs; Shadows, that took me unawares, Eyed with fire and cowled with gloomâ Twilight phantoms, that crowded, dark, Its dim interior, each eye a spark Of sunset, creviced, within the roomâ While a moist, chill, moldering, dead perfume Of crumbling timbers and rotting grain, On floors all warped with the sun and rain, Made of the stagnant air a cell, Round the cobwebbed rafters hung like a spell; Making my mind, despite me, run On thoughts of a hidden skeleton, There in the walls; or, dripping dank, Under the floor, 'neath a certain plank; Glowering, grim in the mossy wet, In its hollow eyes a dark regret. I had entered when the evening-star In the saffron heaven was sparkling afar, In all its glory of light divine, Like a diamond drowned in kingly wine; And I stayed till the heavens hung low and gray, And the clouds of the storm drove down and away, Like the tattered leaves of an Autumn day; And the wild rain beat on the rotting roof The goblin dance of the Fiend's own hoof, Till the spider dropped from its dusty woof; And the thunder throbbed like a mighty heart; And the wild wind filled each crannied part Of the mill with moanings, that seemed to be The voice of an ancient agonyâ Till the beetle shrunk in its board of pine;â While the lightning lit with its instant shine The tossing terror of tree and vine. . . . Then, all on a sudden, the storm was stillâ And I saw her there, near the shattered sill, At the window, gazing from the mill Into the darkness under the storm; Around her flickering hair and form Unearthly glimmer. She seemed to lean To the rushing waters that roared unseen: A moment only she seemed to sway Before me there in the lightning gray, Then vanished utterly away: Like a blown-out light. . . . And was it she, The miller's daughter who died, they say, Who flung herself on the mill's great wheel, Long years ago, in her heart's despair?â Or was it a dream, a fantasy, That the place and the moment made me feel, And imagination imaged there? ON FLOYD'S FORK When the hoot of the owl comes over the hill, At twelve o'clock when the night is still, And pale on the pool where the creek-frogs croon, Glimmering gray is the light o' the moon; And under the willows, where shadows lie, The torch of the firefly wanders by;â They say that the miller walks here, walks here, All covered with chaff, with his crooked staff, And his horrible hobble and hideous laugh; The old, lame miller hung many a year: When the hoot of the owl comes over the hill, He walks in the night by Harrod's mill. When the bark of the fox sounds lone on the hill, At twelve o'clock when the night is chill With the autumn wind, and the waters creep Where the starlight fails and the shadows sleep; And under the willows, that toss and moan, The glow-worm kindles its lanthorn lone;â They say that a woman floats dead, floats dead, In a weedy space that the lilies lace, A curse in her eyes and a smile on her face; The miller's young wife with a gash in her head: When the bark of the fox sounds lone on the hill, She floats in the night by Harrod's mill. When the howl of the hound comes over the hill, At twelve o'clock when the night is ill, And the thunder mutters and rain-winds sob, And the foxfire glows like the lamp of a Lob; And under the willows, that gloom and glance, The will-o'-the-wisps hold a devil's-dance;â They say that that crime is reacted again. And each cranny and chink of the mill doth wink With the light o' hell, or the lightning's blink, And a woman's shrieks are heard through the rain: When the howl of the hound comes over the hill, No man will walk by Harrod's mill. THE WOMAN BY THE WATER She stands within the stormy glow Of sunset, with a face of snow, The white embodiment of woe, As night comes on: She stands within the sombre glare Of dusk, with dark neglected hair, An apparition of despair, When day is gone. The haggard house within the vale Looks spectral as a ragged sail The Dutchman hoists against the gale On haunted seas: And in the garden,âone vast brake Of dock and thistle,âsnail and snake Crawl; and the death-watch taps, awake In rotting trees. The stagnant stream along the night Creeps, like a nightmare, where each white Lily is an uneasy light, A wisp up-tossed: And through the cypress-trees and vines The gray fox skulks and laps and whines; The owl hoots; and the foxfire shines In darkness lost. She stands beside the stagnant stream; Her garments drip at every seam; She looks a shadow in a dream Of dread and woe: No star stares half so steadily At earth as at the water she; And what she sees thereâit may be The owlets know. A STREET OF GHOSTS The drowsy day, with half-closed eyes, Dreams in this quaint forgotten street, That, like some old-world wreckage lies,â Left by the sea's receding beat,â Far from the city's restless feet. Abandoned pavements, that the trees' Huge roots have wrecked; whose flagstones feel No more the sweep of draperies; And sunken curbs, whereon no wheel Grinds, and no gallant's spur-bound heel. Old houses, walled with rotting brick, Thick-creepered, dormered, weather-vaned,â Like withered faces, sad and sick,â Stare from each side, all broken paned, With battered doors the rain has stained. And though the day be white with heat, Their ancient yards are dim and cold; Where now the toad makes its retreat, 'Mid flower-pots green-caked with mold, And naught but noisome weeds unfold. The slow gray slug and snail have trailed Their slimy silver up and down The beds where once the moss-rose veiled Rich beauty; and the mushroom brown Swells where the lily tossed its crown. The shadowy scents, that oft are wont To flit among the walks and boughs, Seem ghosts of sweethearts here who haunt And wander round each empty house, Wrapped in the fragrance of dead vows. And, haply, when the evening droops Her amber eyelids in the west, Here you may hear the swish of hoops, Or catch the glint of hat and vest, As two dim lovers past you pressed. And, instant as some star's slant flame, That scores the swarthy cheek of night, Perhaps behold Colonial dame And gentleman in stately white Go glimmering down the pale moonlight. In powder, patch, and furbelow, Cocked hat and sword; and every one,â Tory and Whig of long-ago,â As real as in the days long done, The courtly days of Washington. BEFORE THE TOMB The way led under cedared gloom Where, o'er the entrance of her tomb, The moon hung, like a cactus bloom. I had an hour of night and thin Sad starlight; and I set my chin Against the grating and looked in. A gleam, like moonlight, through a square Of openingâI knew not whereâ Shone on her coffin resting there. And on its oval silver-plate I read her name and age and date, And smiled, soft-thinking on my hate. There was no insect sound to chirr; No wind to make a little stir: I stood and looked and thought on her. The gleam stole downward from her head, Till at her feet it rested, red On Gothic gold, whose letters said:â âGod to her love lent a weak reed Of strength: and gave no light to lead: Pray for her soul: for it hath need.â There was no night-bird's twitter near; No low, vague water I might hear To make a small sound in the ear. The gleam, that made a burning mark Of each dim word, died to a spark; Then left the tomb and coffin dark. I had a little while to wait; And prayed with hands against the grate, And heart that yearned and knew too late. There was no light below, above, To point my soul the way thereof,â The way of hate that led to love. FLAMENCINE I It was a gipsy maiden Within the forest green; It was a gipsy maiden Who shook a tambourine: The star of eve had not the face, The cascade's foam had not the grace Of Flamencine. II Her bodice was of purple, Her shoes of satin sheen; Her bodice was of purple With scarlet laid between: The wind of eve was in the tread, The black of night was on the head Of Flamencine. III Among the dreaming vistas, The darkling dells between, Among the dreaming vistas I heard her tambourine: And far within the ghostly glade The moonbeams and the shadows played Round Flamencine. IV Among the beechen shadows When fireflies are seen, Among the beechen shadows When glow-worms glimmer green, Then down the darkness, like a light, She dances; and the eyes are bright Of Flamencine. V There lies a gipsy maiden Within the forest green; There lies a gipsy maiden Beside her tambourine: These many years I am her slaveâ The violets grow upon the grave Of Flamencine. HILDEGARD I Hildegard the dÃ¦mons name Her, who meets me on the mountain: Her, whose hair is like the flame Of a sunset-fevered fountain: I can tell her by her eyes, Dreadful eyes of bitter beryl, Where the anguish never dies, And the suffering soul sits sterile In such light as ever lies On the unsailed seas of peril. II How we met I never knew. Once I turnedâand there she trembled Near me, glimmering like the dew In the sessions of assembled Flowers.âHers some influence Of soft, serpent magnetism, Vanquishing my every sense With essential mesmerism; Holding me beneath the lens Of her will's compelling prism. III I can not escape. She treads Noiseless as the forest flowers Walked on by the wind; their heads Pavements for the mottled hours: She is whiter than the trees When their blossoms are unsheathing; She is lissome as the ease Of the lilied water wreathing; She is subtle as the breeze Through the summer foliage breathing. IV When she speaks, within my ears, Like wild music heard in fever Is her voice; and it appears That my soul can never leave her: Babylonian necromance, Oldest witcheries,âthat harrow Yet compel,âare hers; her glance Holds me; and my very marrow Feels it; and I stand a-trance, While her pupils slowly narrow. V Thus she binds me with her gaze, While her white hands weigh my shoulders; And my weak will swings and sways To her gaze that burns and smolders. So she draws me far away, Under boughs where summer dallies: Over peaks of purple day: Far away through Eden alleys: All the way is one long May Till we come to her dark valleys. VI There black tempest treads the peaks; Iron skies are gulfed asunder, Whence the lightning's lava leaks, Vomiting the hosts of thunder. Here she kisses me till red With my heart's blood are her kisses; Then my soul is seized with dread, For it knows no woman this is: Yea, behold! it sees instead But a milk-white snake that hisses. ROMAUNT OF THE OAK âI rode to death, for I fought for shameâ The lady Maurine of noble name, âThe fair and faithless!âThough life be long Is love the wiser?âLove made song âOf all my life; and the soul that crept Before, arose like a star and leapt: âStill leaps with the love that it found untrue, That it found unworthy.âNow run me through! âYea, run me through! for meet and well, And a jest for laughter of fiends in Hell, âIt is that I, who have done no wrong, Should die by the hand of Hugh the Strong, âOf Hugh her leman!âWhat else could be When the devil was judge 'twixt thee and me? âHe splintered my lance, and my blade he brokeâ Now finish me, thou, 'neath the trysting oak!â The shield of his foemanâa heart of white In a bath of fireâshone in the night: The plume of his foeman, as midnight black, Blew, as he leapt on his horse's back: Leapt and laughed as his sword he swung, Then galloped away with a laugh on his tongue. . . . Who is she in the gray, wet dawn, 'Mid the forest shades like a shadow wan? Who kneels, one hand on her straining breast, One hand on the dead man's bosom pressed? Her face is dim as the dead's; and cold As his tarnished harness of steel and gold. O Lady Maurine! O Lady Maurine! What boots it now that regret is keen? That his hair you smooth? that you kiss his brow, What boots it now? what boots it now?â She has haled him under the trysting oak, The huge old oak that the creepers cloak. She has stood him, gaunt in his battered arms, In its haunted hollow.ââBe safe from storms,â She laughed as his cloven casque she placed On his brow, and his riven shield she braced. Then sat and talked to the forest flowers Through the lonely term of the day's pale hours. And stared and whispered and smiled and wept, As nearer and nearer the evening crept. And lo, when the moon, like a great gold bloom Above the sorrowful trees did loom, She rose up sobbing, âO moon, come see My bridegroom here in the old oak-tree! âI have talked to the flowers all day, all day, For never a word had he to say. âHe would not listen, he would not hear, Though I wailed my longing into his ear. âO moon, steal in where he stands so grim, And tell him I love him and plead with him. âSoften his face, that is cold and stern, And brighten his eyes and make them burn, âO moon, white moon, so my soul can see, Can say that they glow with love for me!ââ When the moon had set, and the woods were dark, The wild deer came, and stood as stark As phantoms with eyes of flame; or fled Like a ghostly herd of the hunted dead. And the strix-owl called; and the werewolf snarled; And a voice, in the boughs of the oak-tree gnarled,â Like the whining voice of the hags that ride To the witches' Sabboth,âcrooned and cried. And wrapped in his mantle of wind and cloud, The storm-fiend stalked through the forest loud. When she heard the dead man rattle and groan As the oak was bent and its leaves were blown, And the lightning flickered his shimmering mail,â Through the swirl and sweep of the rain and hail, She seemed to hear him, who seemed to call,â âCome hither, Maurine! the wild leaves fall! The wild leaves rustle, the wild leaves fleeâ Come hither, Maurine, to the hollow tree! âTo the trysting tree, to the tree once green, Come hither, Maurine! come hither, Maurine!â . . . They found her closed in his armored armsâ Had he claimed his bride on that night of storms? A REED SHAKEN WITH THE WIND I Not for you and me the path Winding through the shadowless Fields of morning's dewiness! Where the brook that hurries hath Laughter lighter than a boy's; Where recurrent odors poise, Romp-like, with irreverent tresses, In the sun; and leaves and boughs Build a music-haunted house For the winds to hang their dresses, Whisper-silken, rustling in. Ours a path that led unto Twilight regions gray with dew; Where moon-vapors gathered thin Over acres sisterless Of all healthy beauty; where Fungus growths made sad the air As a phantom-felt caress: Under darkness and strange stars, To the sorrow-silenced bars Of a dubious forestland, Where the wood-scents seemed to stand, And the sounds on either hand, Clad like Sleep's own servitors In the shadowy livery Of the ancient House of Dreams, Which before us,âfitfully, With white intermittent gleams Of its pale-lamped windows,âshone, Echoing with the dim unknown. II To say to Hope,âTake all from me, And grant me naught: Take rose, and song, and melody, And word and thought: Then all my life make me her slave,â Is all I crave. To say to Time,âBe true to me, Nor grant me less Of loss, of grief, of memory, Of heart's distress: Then for her love set me a task, Is all I ask. III I came to you when eve was young: And, where the park rolled downward to The river, and among the dew, One vesper moment, lit and sung A bird, your eyes said something true, Said something to my eyes, more dear Than song the bird poured, silver-clear. How sweet it was to be with you! How, with our souls, we seemed to hear The night approaching with its stars! How calm the moon sloped up her sphere Of fire-filled pearl through passive bars Of clouds that berged the tender east! While all the dark inanimate Of Nature woke; initiate With th' moon's arrival, something ceased In Nature's soul: she stood again Another self, that seemed t' have been Dormant, suppressed and so unseen All day: a life, unknown and strange And dream-suggestive, that had lain,â Masked on with light,âwithin the range Of thought, but unrevealed till now. It was the hour of love. And you, With downward eyes and pensive brow, Among the moonlight and the dew,â Although no word of love was spoken,â Heard the sweet night's confession broken Of something here more sweet in me: A love, depth made inaudible, Save to your soul, that answered well, With eyes replying silently. IV Fair you are as a rose is fair, There where the shadows dew it; And the deeps of your brown, brown hair, Soft as the cloud that lingers there With the sunset's auburn through it. Eyes of azure and throat of snow, Tell me what my heart would know! Every dream I dream of you Has a love-thought in it, And a hope, a kiss or two, Something dear and something true, Telling me each minute, With three words it whispers clear What my heart from you would hear. V Junetime came: the days grew kind With increasing beauty: deep Were the nights with rest and sleep: Fair, with poppies intertwined On their blond locks, went the Hours, Sunny-hearted as the rose, Through the buds and banded flowers, Teaching them, how no one knows, Freshness, color, and perfume.â In the window of your room Bloomed a late azalea. Pink As an egret's rosy plumes Shone its tender-tufted blooms. From your care and love, I think, Love's rose-color it did drink, Growing rosier day by day Through your 'tending hand's caress: And your own dear naturalness Had imbued it in some way. Once you gave a blossom of it, Smiling, to me when I left: Need I tell you how I love it Faded though it is now!â'Reft Of its fragrance and its color, Yet 'tis dearer now than then, âAs past happiness is when Life regrets.âAnd dimmer, duller Though its beauty be, when I Look upon it, I recall Every part of that old wall; And the dingy window high, Where you sat and read; and all The fond love that made your face A soft sunbeam in that place: And the plant that grew this bloom Withered here, itself long dead, Makes a halo overhead There againâand through my room, Like faint whispers of perfume, Steal the words of love then said. VI All of my love I send to you, I send to you, On thoughts, like moths, that wend to you Out of my heart's glad garden, O'er which, its lovely warden, Your face, a lily seeming, Is dreaming. All of my life I bring to you, I bring to you, In deeds, like birds, that wing to you Out of my soul's deep valley, O'er which, most musically, Your love, a fountain, glistens, And listens. My love, my life, how blessed in you! How blessed in you! Whose thoughts, whose deeds find rest in you Here on my life's dark ocean, O'er which, in heavenly motion, Your soul, a star, abideth, And guideth. VII Where the old Kentucky wound Through the land,âits stream between Hills of primitive forest green,â Like a goodly belt around Giant breasts of grandeur; with Many an unknown Indian myth, On the boat we steamed. The land Like an hospitable hand Welcomed us. Alone we sat On the under-deck, and saw Farm-house and plantation draw Near and vanish. 'Neath your hat Your young eyes laughed; and your hair, Blown about them by the air Of our passage, clung and curled. Music, and the summer moon; And the hills' great shadows hewn Out of silence; and the tune Of the whistle, when we whirled Round a moonlit bend in sight of Some lone landing heaped with hay Or tobacco; where the light of One dim, solitary lamp Signaled through the evening's damp: Then a bell; and, dusky gray, Shuffling figures on the shore With the cable; rugged forms On the gang-plank; backs and arms With their cargo bending o'er; And the burly mate before. Then an iron bell, and puff Of escaping steam; and out Where the stream is wheel-whipped rough; Music, and a parting shout From the shore; the pilot's bell Beating on the deck below; Then the steady, quivering, slow, Smooth advance again. Until Twinkling lights beyond us tell Of a lock or little town Clasped between a hill and hill, Where the bluegrass fields slope down.â So we went. That summer-time Lingers with me like a rhyme Learned for dreamy beauty of Its old-fashioned faith and love, In some musing moment; sith Heart-associated with Joy that moment's quiet bore, And forgotten nevermore. VIII Three sweet things love lives upon: Music, at whose fountain's brink Low he stoops his face to drink; Seeing, as the wave is drawn, His near image rise and sink. Three sweet things love lives upon. Three sweet things love lives upon: Odor, whose red roses wreathe His bright brow that shines beneath; Hearing, as each bloom is blown, His soul's essence breathe and breathe. Three sweet things love lives upon. Three sweet things love lives upon: Color, to whose rainbow he Lifts his dark eyes burningly; Feeling, as the wild hues dawn, His high immortality. Three sweet things love lives upon. X Memories of other days,â Sad with whilom happiness,â Rise before my musing gaze In the twilight. . . . And your dress Seems beside me, like a haze Shimmering white; as when we went 'Neath the star-strewn firmament, Love-led, with impatient feet Down the night that, summer-sweet, Sparkled o'er the lamp-lit street. Every look you gave me then Comes before my eyes again, Making music for my heart On that path where once for us Roses, red and amorous, Grew, the roses red of love: Roses, that are dead enough On that path now! whence oft start Out of recollected places, With remembered forms and faces, Dreams of love, like figures, woven In my life's dark tapestry, Beckoning, ever shadowy, To my soul still.âO'er the cloven Gulf of time I seem to hear Words once whispered in my ear, Callingâas might friends long dead, With familiar voices deep, Call to one who lies asleep, Comforting.âSo was I led Backward to forgotten things, Contiguities that spread Sudden, unremembered wings: And across my mind's still blue, From the nest they fledged in, flew Dazzling shapes that passion knew. X Ah! over full my heart is Of sadness and of pain: As a rose-flower in the garden The dull dusk fills with rain; As a blown red rose that shivers And bows to the wind and rain. So give me your hands and speak me As once in the days of yore, When love spoke sweetly to us, The love that speaks no more: The sound of your voice may help him To speak in my heart once more. Ah! over grieved my soul is, And tired and sick for sleep, As a poppy-bloom that withers, Forgotten, where reapers reap: As a harvested poppy-flower That dies where reapers reap. So bend to my face and kiss me As once in the days of yore, When the touch of your lips was magic That restored to life once more: The thought of your kiss, which awakens To life that love once more. XI Sitting often I have, oh! Often have desired you soâ Yearned to kiss you as I did When your love to me you gave, In the moonlight, by the wave, And a long-remembered kiss Pressed upon your mouth that chid, Then upon each eye's sweet lidâ That, all passion-shaken, I With love-language will address Each dear thing I know you by, Picture, needle-work, or frame; Each suggestive in the same Perfume of past happiness: Till, meseems, the ways we knew Now again I tread with you From the old-time tryst: and there Feel the pressure of your hair Cool and young upon my cheek, And your breath's aroma: bare On my arm your hand,âas weak As a lily on a stream:â And once more you look at me With the sometime witchery, And again I hear you speak; And remembered ecstasy Sweeps my soul again.âI seem Dreaming. . . . Would I thus might dream Ever! and reality Mix itself eternally With such visions of the past, Where my soul still holds you fast! XII When day dies, lone, forsaken, And joy is kissed asleep; When doubt's gray eyes awaken, And love, with music taken From hearts with sighings shaken, Sits in the dusk to weep: With ghostly-lifted finger What memory then shall rise? Of dark regret the bringerâ To tell the sorrowing singer Of days whose echoes linger, Till dawn unstars the skies. When night is gone and, beaming, Faith journeys forth to toil; When hope's blue eyes wake gleaming, And life is done with dreaming The dreams that seem but seeming Within the world's turmoil: Who may forget the presence Of death that walks unseen? Whose scythe casts shadowy crescents Around life's glittering essence, As lessens, slowly lessens, The space that lies between. XIII Bland was that October day, Calm and balmy as the spring, When we went a forest way, Under beeches, lichen-gray, To a valleyed opening; Where the purple aster flowered, And, like torches, savage-held, Red the fiery sumac towered; And, where gum-trees sentineled Vistas, robed in gold and garnet, Ripe the thorny chestnut shelled Its brown plumpness. Bee and hornet Droned around us; low the cricket, Tireless in the wood-rose thicket, Tremoloed; and, to the wind All its moon-spun silver casting, Swung the milkweed's pod, that thinned, Where a butterfly seemed pinned: And its clean flame on the sod By the fading goldenrod, Burned the white life-everlasting.â It was not so much the time, Nor the place, nor way we went, That made all our moods to rhyme, Nor the season's sentiment, As it was the innocent Carefree childhood of our hearts, Reading each expression of Death and change as life and love: That impression joy imparts Unto others and retorts On itself, which then made glad All the sorrow of decay, As the memory of that day Makes this day of autumn sad. XIV The pungent-breathed petunias Hang riven of the rain; And where the tiger-lily was Now droops a tawny stain; While in the twilight's purple pause Earth dreams of heaven again. When love sits down to sigh, Where one lies all alone Beneath the sod's green skyâ What boots it then to try, Or to atone? With ragged petals round its pod The rain-wrecked poppy dies; And where the hectic rose did nod A crumbled crimson lies; While distant as the dreams of God The stars slip in the skies. When love lies down to sleep, When one is dead and goneâ Within the darkness deep What boots it then to weep? All's said and done. XV Holding both your hands in mine, Often have we sat together, While, outside, the boisterous weather Hung the wild wind on the pine Like a black marauder, and With a sudden warning hand At the casement rapped. The night Wrote no line or glimmer of light, Starbeam-syllabled, within Her dark book of death and sin, Cloudy-chaptered tragicly.â Looking in your eyes, ah me! Though I knew, I did not heed What the night wrote there for us, Threatening and ominous: For love helped my heart to read Forward to unopened pages Of a coming day, that held More for us than all the ages Past, that it epitomized In one sentence; where was spelled What our present realized Onlyâall the love that was Past and still to be for us. XVI 'Though in the garden, gray with dew, All life lies withering, And there's no more to say or do, No more to sigh or sing, Come back with me the ways we knew When buds were opening. Perhaps we shall not search in vain Within its wreck and gloom; 'Mid roses ruined of the rain There still may live one bloom; One flower, whose heart may still retain The long-lost soul-perfume. And then, perhaps, will come to us The dreams we dreamed of yore; And song, who spoke so beauteous, Will speak to us once more; And love, with eyes all amorous, Will gaze as once before. So 'though the yard is gray with dew, And flowers are withering, And there's no more to say or do, No more to sigh or sing, Come back with me the ways we knew When buds were opening. XVII Looking on the desolate street, Where the first snow drifts and drives, Trodden black of hurrying feet, Where the athlete storm-wind strives With each tree and dangling light,â Centres, sphered with glittering white,â Hissing in the dancing snow . . . Backward in my mind I go To that tempest-haunted night Of two autumns past, when we, Hastening homeward, were o'ertaken Of the storm; and 'neath a tree, With its wild leaves tempest-shaken, Sheltered us in that forsaken, Sad and ancient cemetery,â Where folk came no more to bury.â Haggard gravestones, mossed and crumbled, Tottered round us, or o'ertumbled In their sunken graves; and some, Urned and obelisked above Iron-fenced-in tombs, stood dumb Records of forgotten love. And again I see the west Yawning inward to its core Of electric-spasmed ore, Swiftly, without pause or rest: And a great wind sweeps the dust Up abandoned sidewalks; and, In the rotting trees, the gust Shouts againâa voice that would Make its gaunt self understood Moaning over Death's lean land.â And we sat there, hand in hand; On the granite; where we read, By the instant skies o'erhead, Something of one young and dead. Yet the words begot no fear In our souls: you leaned your cheek Smiling on mine: very near Were our lips: we did not speak. XVIII And suddenly alone I stood With scared eyes gazing through the wood, For some still sign of ill or good To lead me from the solitude. The day was at its twilighting; One cloud o'erhead spread a vast wing Of rosy thunder; vanishing Behind the far hills' sullen ring. Some stars shone timidly o'erhead; And towards the west's cadaverous redâ Like some wild dream that haunts the dead In limboâthe lean moon was led. Upon the sad, debatable Vague lands of twilight slowly fell A silence that I knew too well, A sorrow that I can not tell. What way to take, what path to go, Whether into the east's gray glow, Or where the west burnt red and lowâ What way to choose I did not know. So, hesitating, there I stood Lost in my soul's uncertain wood; One sign I craved of ill or good To lead me from its solitude. XIX It was autumn: and a night Full of whispers and of mist, With a gray moon, wanly whist, Hanging like a phantom light O'er the hills. We stood among Windy fields of weed and flower, Where the withered seed-pod hung, And the chill leaf-cricket sung. Melancholy was the hour With the mystery and loneness Of the year, that seemed to look On its own departed faceâ As our love then, in its oneness, All its dead past did retrace, And from that sad moment took Presage of approaching parting.â Sorrowful the hour and dark: Low among the trees, now darting, Now concealed, a lamp's pale sparkâ Like a fen-fireâwinked and lured Shut among the shadows, where All was doubtful, unassured, Immaterial; and bare Facts of unideal day Changed to substance such as dreams. And meseemed then, far awayâ Farther than remotest gleams Of the starsâlost, separated, And estranged and out of reach, Grew our lives away from each, Far away as it was fated. XX There is no gladness in the day Now you're away; Dull is the morn, the noon is dull, Once beautiful; And when the sunset fills the skies With dusking dyes, With tired eyes and tired heart I sit alone, I sigh apart, And wish for you, For only you. Ah! darker now the night comes on Since you are gone; Sad are the stars, the moon is sad, Once wholly glad; And when the stars and moon are set, And earth lies wet, With heart's regret and soul's hard ache, I dream alone, I lie awake, And think of you, Of only you. These, who once spake me, speak no more, Now all is o'er; Day hath forgot the language of Its hopes of love; Night, whose sweet lips were burdensome With dreams, is dumb; Far different from what used to be With grief and loss they speak to me, They speak of you, Of only you. XXI So it endsâthe path that crept Through a land all slumber-whist; Where the faded moonlight slept Like a pale antagonist. Now the star that led me onward,â Reassuring with its light,â Fails and falters; dipping downward Leaves me wandering in night, With old doubts, like hounds unchained, Baying at my back, in flight. . . . So it ends. The woods attainedâ Where our hearts' Desire builded A fair temple, fire-gilded, With Hope's marble shrine within, (Where the lineaments of our love Shone, with lilies clad and crowned, Under marble reared above Sorrow and her sister, Sin, Columned, wreathed and ribbon-wound,)â In the forest I have found But a ruin! All around Lie the shattered capitals, And vast fragments of the walls . . . Like a climbing cloud,âthat plies, Wind-wrecked, o'er the moon that lies 'Neath its blackness,âtaking on Gradual certainties of wan, Soft assaults of easy white, (Till its huge cocoon, that holds Like a moth the moon, unfolds, And it passes) and the skies' Emptiness and hungry night Claim its bulk again, while she Rides in lonely purity:â So I found our temple broken; And a musing moment's space Love, whose latest word was spoken, Seemed to meet me face to face, Making bright that ruined place With a white effulgenceâthen Passed, and all was dark again. WOMAN'S PORTION I The leaves are shivering on the thorn, Drearily; And sighing wakes the sad-eyed morn, Wearily. I press my thin face to the pane, Drearily; But never will he come again. Wearily. The rain hath sicklied day with haze, Drearily; My tears run downward as I gaze, Wearily. The mist and morn spake unto me, Drearily:â âWhat is this thing God gives to thee, Wearily?â I said unto the morn and mist, Drearily:â âThe babe unborn whom sin hath kissed, Wearily.â The morn and mist spake unto me, Drearily:â âWhat is this thing which thou dost see, Wearily?â I said unto the mist and morn, Drearily:â âThe shame of man and woman's scorn, Wearily.â âHe loved thee not,â they made reply, Drearily.â I said, âWould God had let me die!â Wearily. II My hopes are as a closed-up book, Drearily, Upon whose clasp of love I look Wearily. All night the rain raved overhead, Drearily; All night I wept, awake in bed, Wearily. I heard the wind sweep wild and wide, Drearily; And turned upon my face and sighed Wearily. The wind and rain spake unto me, Drearily:â âWhat is this thing God takes from thee, Wearily?â I said unto the rain and wind, Drearily:â âThe love, for which my body sinned, Wearily.â The rain and wind spake unto me, Drearily:â âWhat are these things that burden thee, Wearily?â I said unto the wind and rain, Drearily:â âPast joys, and dreams whose ghosts remain, Wearily.â âThou lov'st him still,â they made reply, Drearily.â I said, âWould God that I could die!â Wearily. KU KLUX We have sent him seeds of the melon's core, And nailed a warning upon his door: By the Ku Klux laws we can do no more. Down in the hollow, 'mid crib and stack, The roof of his low-porched house looms black; Not a line of light at the door-sill's crack. Yet arm and mount! and mask and ride! The hounds can sense though the fox may hide! And for a word too much men oft have died. The clouds blow heavy toward the moon. The edge of the storm will reach it soon. The kildee cries and the lonesome loon. The clouds shall flush with a wilder glare Than the lightning makes with its angled flare, When the Ku Klux verdict is given there. In the pause of the thunder rolling low, A rifle's signalâwho shall know From the wind's fierce hurl and the rain's black blow? Only the signature, written grim At the end of the message brought to himâ A hempen rope and a twisted limb. So arm and mount! and mask and ride! The hounds can sense though the fox may hide! And for a word too much men oft have died. AT DAWN Far off I heard dark waters rush: The sky was cold: the dawn broke green: And wrapped in twilight and strange hush The gray wind moaned between. A voice rang through the House of Sleep, And through its halls there went a tread; Mysterious raiment seemed to sweep Around one lying dead. And then I knew that I had died, I, who had suffered so and sinnedâ And 'twas myself I stood beside In the gray dawn and wind. PRÃTERITA I Low belts of rushes ragged with the blast; Lagoons of marish reddening with the west; And o'er the marsh the water-fowl's unrest While daylight dwindles and the dusk falls fast. Set in sad walls, all mossy with the past, An old stone gateway with a crumbling crest; A garden where death drowses manifest; And in gaunt yews the shadowy house at last. Here, like an unseen spirit, silence talks With echo and the wind in each gray room Where melancholy slumbers with the rain: Or, like some gentle ghost, the moonlight walks In the dim garden, which her smile makes bloom With all the old-time loveliness again. II When slow the twilight settles o'er its roof, And from the haggard oaks unto its door The rain comes, wild as one who rides before His enemies that follow, hoof to hoof; And in each window's gusty curtain-woof The rain-wind sighs, like one who mutters o'er Some tale of love and crime; and, on the floor, The sunset spreads red stains as bloody proof:â From hall to hall and haunted stair to stair, Through all the house, a dread, that drags me to'ard The ancient dusk of that avoided room, Wherein she sits with ghostly golden hair, And eyes that gaze beyond her soul's sad doom, Waking the ghost of that old harpsichord. IN SHADOW I A moth sucks at a flaming flower: The moon beams on the old church-tower: I watched the moth and rising moon, One silver tip Of glimmer, slip Through ghostly tree-tops, deep with June, To dream above the church an hour. II The gray moth on the dewy pod Dreams; and the sleepy poppies nod Their drugged heads in the languid breeze, That whispers low Of some dim woe, And spirit-like among the trees, Strews snowy petals on the sod. III My soul dreams at life's blood-red heart Of that thou art: of thee, who art All silence: saying something fair As phantoms know When moon-flowers blow And spirits meet: the beauty rare Of which thou, too, hast grown a part. IV My heart, behold, is but a bloom A pale thought clings to by a tomb, A tomb that holds the one I love, All wan of cheek, Whom, wild and weak, My heart bows down and breaks above, Grief-haunted in the moonlit gloom. IN THE OWL-LIGHT I Uplifted darkness and the owl-light breaks, Scuds the wild land, pursuing patch with patch, As when deep daisy fields a swift wind shakes.â How clumsily I raised the crazy latch! . . . So.âWhen yon black cloud, light-absorbing, rakes Again the moon's bald diskâ Out! and the storm will snatch Again my hair, made lank with wind and rain Two hours since . . . There! from the ragged plain A great cloud-besom sweeps the beams again!â Out! out! . . . No fear of risk? . . . II First, past the fellside, where the bramble-hollow Whines, wolf-like, with the wind; gaunt wind, that grieves Through the one sickly ash, whose withered leaves Worry and mutter, shriveled as the lips Of bent hags kissing. Thenâthe slope that whips The face with brush; and where a gnarled vine slips, Snake-like, from off a rock, that seems to wallow,â One mass of briers,âa humpbacked hulk of hair, A gorgon head of writhings, huge, that heaves, When, heaped abruptly on it, flare! Burst rain and tempest-glare.â This passed, I follow A thorny slip of path until I reach the storm-scarred summit of the hill. III Let me not think of it!âas I go thence,â That thought I can not kill! Ungovernable! that dogs my footsteps still, Like something real and living; which my will Is powerless against.âAh! when that fence, Dividing the dark ridges of the hill, Is passed, shall I not then be breathless? ill With sinking sense Of ghastly things to come?âSome sterner strength Sustain my soul!âBeyond the hill the dense Dead wood's to pass, and then . . . that livid length Of mooning water, spectral and immense With sullen storm and night. . . . There, if the ghoulish wind,â That knows well as I know how I have sinned,â Will cease to curse me in its hag-like spite, Alone with all the horror of my soul, I shall behold, Now this way, and now that way rolled, Lifeless, among cramped reeds, the storm has thinned,â With wide, white eyes, metallic in the light Of the impassive moon:âin gusty roll Of washing ripples, webby, slippery locks Dabbling and dark; and,âwedged between sharp rocks,â Two rocks, two iron fangs, Whereon the lake's mad lip, pale-foaming clangs,â Wild-pinched and water-strangled white, His murdered face! that mocks. ASHLY MERE Come! look in the shadowy water here, The stagnant water of Ashly Mere: Where the stirless depths are dark but clear, What is the thing that lies there?â A lily-pod, half-sunk from sight? Or spawn of the toad, all water-white? Or ashen blur of the moon's wan light? Or a woman's face and eyes there? Now lean to the water a listening ear, The haunted water of Ashly Mere: What is the sound that you seem to hear In the ghostly hush of the deeps there?â A withered reed, that the ripple lips? Or a night-bird's wing, that the surface whips? Or the rain in a leaf that drips and drips? Or a woman's voice that weeps there? Now look and listen! but not too near The lonely water of Ashly Mere!â For so it happens this time each year As you lean by the Mere and listen: And the moaning voice I understand,â For oft I have watched it draw to land, And lift from the water a ghastly hand And a face whose dead eyes glisten. And this is the reason why every year To the hideous water of Ashly Mere I come when the woodland leaves are sear, And the autumn moon hangs hoary: For here by the Mere was wrought a wrong But the old, old story is overlongâ And woman is weak and man is strong, And the Mere's and mine is the story. THE HEADLESS HORSEMAN On the black road through the wood, As I rode, There the Headless Horseman stood, By the dark pool in the wood, As I rode. From the shadow of an oak, As I rode, Demon steed and rider broke; By the thunder-riven oak, As I rode. On the wild way through the plain, As I rode, At my back he whirled like rain; On the tempest-blackened plain, As I rode. Four black hoofs shod red with fire, As I rode, Woke the wild rocks, dark and dire; Eyes and nostrils streaming fire, As I rode. On the deep path through the rocks, As I rode, I could touch his horse's locks; Through the echo-hurling rocks, As I rode. And again I looked behind, As I rodeâ Dark as night and swift as wind, Towering, he rode behind, As I rode. On the steep road through the dell, As I rode, Far away I heard a bell, In the church beyond the dell, As I rode. And my soul cried out in prayer, As I rodeâ Lo! the demon went in air, When my soul called out in prayer, As I rode. THE WEREWOLF She Nay; still amort, my love?âWhy dost thou lag? He The strix-owl cried. She Nay! 'twas yon stream that leaps Hoarse from the black pines of the Hakel steeps; Its moon-wild water glittering down the crag.â Why so aghast, sweetheart? Why dost thou stop? He The Demon Huntsman passed with hooting horn! She Nay! 'twas the blind wind sweeping through the thorn Around the ruins of the Dumburg's top. He My limbs are cold. She Come! warm thee in my arms. He My eyes are weary. She Rest, them, love, on mine. He I am athirst. She Quench, on my lips, thy thirst.â O dear belovÃ©d, how thy last kiss warms My blood again! He Off! . . . How thy eyeballs shine!â Thou beast! . . . thouâAh! . . . thus do I die, accursed! THE SEA SPIRIT Ah me! I shall not waken soon From dreams of such divinity! A spirit singing 'neath the moon To me. Wild sea-spray driven of the storm Is not so wildly white as she, Who beckoned with a foam-white arm To me. With eyes dark green, and golden-green Long locks, that sparkled drippingly, Out of the green wave she did lean To me. And sang; till Earth and Heaven were A far, forgotten memory; Till more than Heaven seemed in her To me:â Sleep, sweeter than love's face or home, And death's immutability, And music of the plangent foam, Ah me! Sweep over her with all thy ships, With all thy stormy tides, O sea! The memory of immortal lips, And me! THE VAMPIRE A lily in a twilight place? Or moonflower in the lonely night?â Strange beauty of a woman's face Of wildflower-white! The rain that hangs a star's green ray Slim on a leaf-point's restlessness, Is not so glimmering green and gray As was her dress. I drew her dark hair from her eyes, And in their deeps beheld a while Such shadowy moonlight as the skies Of Hell may smile. She held her mouth up, redly wan And burning cold:âI bent and kissed Such rosy snow as some wild dawn Makes of a mist. God shall not take from me that hour, When round my neck her white arms clung! When 'neath my lips, like some fierce flower, Her white throat swung! Nor words she murmured while she leaned! Witch-words, she holds me softly by,â The spell that binds me to a fiend Until I die. WILL-O'-THE-WISP I There is the calamus he stands With frog-webbed feet and bat-winged hands; His glow-worm garb glints goblin-wise; And elfishly, and impishly, Above the gleam of owlet eyes, A death's-head cap of downy dyes Nods out at me, and beckons me. II Now in the reeds his face looks white As witch-down on a witches' night; Now through the dark, old, haunted mill, All eerily, all flickeringly He flits; and with a whippoorwill Mouth calls, and seems to syllable, âCome follow me! oh, follow me!â III Now o'er the sluggish stream he wends, A slim light at his fingers' ends; The spotted spawn, the toad hath clomb, Slips oozily, sucks slimily; His easy footsteps seem to comeâ Like bubble-gaspings of the scumâ This side of me; that side of me. IV There by the stagnant pool he stands, A foxfire lamp in flickering hands; The weeds are slimy to the tread, And mockingly, and gloatingly, With slanted eyes and pointed head, He leans above a face long dead,â The face of me! of me! of me! REVISITED It was beneath a waning moon when all the woods were sear, And winds made eddies of the leaves that whispered far and near, I met her on the bramble bridge we parted at last year. At first I deemed her but a mist that faltered in that place, An autumn mist beneath the trees the moon's thin beams did lace, Until I neared and in the moon beheld her face to face. The crinkle of the summer heat above the drouth-burnt leas; The shimmer of the thistle-drift adown the silences; The gliding of the fairy-fire between the swamp and trees: All qualified her presence as a sorrow may a dreamâ The vague suggestion of a self; the glimmer of a gleam; The actual and unreal of the things that are and seem. Where once she came with welcome and glad eyes, all loving-wise, She passed, and gave no greeting that my heart could recognize, With far, set face, unseeing, and sad, unremembering eyes. It was beneath a waning moon when woods were bleak and sear, And winds made whispers of the leaves that eddied far and near, I met her ghost upon the bridge we parted at last year. THE OLD HOUSE Quaint and forgotten, by an unused road, An old house stands: around its doors the dense Rank ironweeds grow high; The chipmunks make a highway of its fence; And on its sunken flagstones newt and toad As still as lichens lie. The timid snake upon its hearth's cool sand Sleeps undisturbed; the squirrel haunts its roof; And in the clapboard sides Of closets,âdim with many a spider woof,â Like the uncertain tapping of a hand, The beetle-borer hides. Above its lintel, under mossy eaves, The mud-wasps build their cells; and in the floor Of its neglected porch The black bees nest: through each deserted door, Vague as faint, phantom footsteps, steal the leaves And dropped cones of the larch. But come with me when sunset's magic old Transforms this ruinâyea! transmutes this house: When windows, one by one,â Like Age's eyes, that Youth's love-dreams arouse,â Grow lairs of fire; and a mouth of gold Its wide door towards the sun. Or let us wait until each rain-stained room Is carpeted with moonlight, patterned oft With shadow'd boughs o'erhead; And through the house the wind goes rustling soft, As might the ghostâa whisper of perfumeâ Of some sweet girl long dead. THE FOREST OF DREAMS I Where was I last Friday night?â Within the Forest of dark Dreams Following the blur of a goblin light, That led me over dreadful streams, Whereon the scum of the spawn was spread, And the blistered slime, in stagnant seams; Where the weed and the moss swam black and dead, Like a drowned girl's hair, in the ropy ooze: And the jack-o'-lantern light that led Flickered the foxfire trees o'erhead, And the owl-like things at airy cruise. II Where was I last Friday night?â Within the Forest of dark Dreams Following a form of shadowy white With my own wild face it seems.â Did a raven's wing just fan my hair? Or a web-winged bat brush by my face? Or the hand ofâsomething I did not dare Look round to see in that obscene place! Where the boughs, with their leaves a-devil's-dance, And the thorn-tree bush, where the wind made moan, Had more than a strange significance Of life and of evil not their own. III Where was I last Friday night?â Within the Forest of dark Dreams Seeing the mists rise left and right, Like the leathery fog that heaves and steams From the rolling horror of Hell's red streams: While the wind, that tossed in the tattered tree, And danced alone with the last mad leafâ Or was it the wind? . . . kept whispering me, âCome! bury it here with its own black grief, And its heart of fire that naught can save!ââ And there in the darkness I seemed to see My own self digging my soul a grave. THE CITY OF DARKNESS Wide-walled it stands in heathen lands Beside a mystic sea, Its streets strange-trod of many a god And templed blasphemy. Far through the night, with light on light, It flames beside the sea; While overhead an unseen dread Impends eternally. There is a sound above, around, Of music by the sea; And weird and wide the torches glide Of pagan revelry. There is a noise as of a voice That calls beneath the sea; And all the deep heaves, as in sleep, With vague expectancy. Then slowly upâas in a cup Seethes poisonâswells the sea; As through black glass, wild mass on mass, The town glows fiery. Red-lit it glowers, like Hell's dark towers, Closed in the iron sea; And monster forms in awful swarms Wing round it cloudily. Still overhead the unseen dread, Whose shadow dyes the sea, At wrath-winged wait behind its gate Till God shall set it free. An earthquake crash; a taloned flashâ And, lo! from sky to sea A sworded Doom that stalks the gloom, Crowned with Death's agony. And where it burned, a flame inurned, Blood-red within the sea, The phantasm of the dread above Sits in immensity. UNDER DARK SKIES I Hills rolled in woods, that lair the lynx and fox; Harsh fields, that lean before the woods' advance As wild-men fly from hunters, tossing locks Through which their eyes of yellow fire glance; Great blurs of briers and lugubrious rocks,â A bristling blackness,âwith a pool beneath, Whereo'er the wisps, like something evil, dance; And then a house like the wrecked face of death. II There where the moon hangs sinister, o'er parched And haggard thorns,âa golden battle-bow, Or shield of bronze, old wars have scarred and scorched,â What crime hath cursed it . . . who shall ever know?â Night only! Night, with flickering flame, who torched That moment when blood branded black its sod, And in the pool a ghastly face sank slow Beneath the storm and rushing fire of God. REMBRANDTS I I shall not soon forget her and her eyes, The haunts of hate, where suffering seemed to write Its stealthy name, whose syllables are sighs, In strange and starless night. I shall not soon forget her and her face, So quiet, yet uneasy as a dream That stands on tip-toe in a haunted place And listens for a scream. She made me feel as one, alone, may feel In some grand, ghostly mansion of old time, The presence of a treasure, walls conceal, And secret of a crime. II With lambent faces, mimicking the moon, The water lilies lie; Dotting the darkness of the long lagoon As stars, the sky. A face, the whiteness of a water-flower, With pollen-golden hair, In shadow half, half in the moonlight's glower, Lifts slowly there. A young girl's face, death makes mute marble of, Turned to the moon and me, Sad with the pathos of unspeakable love, Floating to sea. III One listening bent, in dread of something coming He can not flee nor balkâ A phantom footstep, in the ghostly gloaming, That haunts a ruined walk. Long has he given his whole heart's hard endeavor To labor, dark and dawn, Dreaming that Love still watched his toil and ever Turned kindly eyes thereon. Now in his life, he feels, there nears an hour, Inevitable, alas! When in the darkness he shall cringe and cower, And see his dead self pass. GHOSTS Was it the strain of the waltz that, repeating Love, so bewitched me? or only the gleam There of the lustres, that set my heart beating, Feeling your presence as one feels a dream? For, on a sudden, the woman of fashion, Soft at my side in her diamonds and lace, Vanished, and pale with reproach or with passion, You, my dead sweetheart, looked up in my face. Music, the nebulous lights, and the sifting Fragrance of women made amorous the air; Born of these three and my thoughts you came drifting, Clad in dim muslin, a rose in your hair. There in the waltz, that followed the lancers, Hard to my breast did I crush you and hold; Far through the stir and the throng of the dancers Onward I bore you as often of old. Pale were your looks; and the rose in your tresses Paler of hue than the dreams we have lost;â âWho,â then I said, âis it sees or who guesses, Here in the hall, that I dance with a ghost?â Gone!âAnd the dance and the music are ended. Gone!âAnd the rapture is turned into sighs. And, on my arm, in her elegance splendid, The woman of fashion smiles up in my eyes. Had I forgotten? and did she remember?â She who is dead, whom I can not forget: She, for whose sake all my heart is an ember Covered with ashes of dreams and regret. AT MIDNIGHT At midnight in the trysting wood I wandered by the waterside, When, soft as mist, before me stood My sweetheart who had died. But so unchanged was she, meseemed That I had only dreamed her dead; Glad in her eyes the lovelight gleamed; Her lips were warm and red. What though the stars shone shadowy through Her form as by my side she went, And by her feet no drop of dew Was stirred, no blade was bent! What though through her white loveliness The wildflower dimmed, the moonlight paled, Real to my touch she was; no less Than when the earth prevailed. She took my hand. My heart beat wild. She kissed my mouth. I bowed my head. Then, gazing in my eyes, she smiled: âWhen did'st thou die?â she said. THAT NIGHT That night I sat listening, as in a swoon, With half-closed eyes, To far-off bells, low-lulling as a tune That drifts and dies Beneath the flowery fingers of the June Harping to summer skies. And then I dreamed the world I knew was gone, And some one brought,â Leading me far o'er sainted hill and lawn, In heavenly thought,â My soul where well the sources of the dawn With dew and fire fraught. Above me the majestic dome of night, With star on star, Sparkled; in which one star shone blinding bright; Radiant as spar That walls the halls of morning, pearly white Around her golden car. About me temples, vast in desert seas, Columned a land Of ruinsâbones of old monstrosities God's awful hand Had smitten; homes of dead idolatries, O'erwhelmed with dust and sand. Their bestial gods, caked thick with gems and gold, Their blasphemies Of beauty, rent; 'mid ruined altars rolled; Their agonies And rites abolished; and their priests of oldâ Dust on the desert breeze. Then Syrian valleys, purple with veiling mist, Meseemed I trailed, Where the frail floweret, by the dewdrop kissed, Soft-blushing, quailed; And drowned in dingled deeps of amethyst The moon-mad bulbul wailed. On glimmering wolds I seemed to hear the bleat Of folded flocks: Then shepherds passed me, bare of head and feet; And then an ox Lowed; and, above me, swept the solemn beat Of angel wings and locks. A manger then I seemed to see where bent, In adoration, Above a babe, Men of the Orient, Where, low of station, His mother lay, while round them swam sweet scent And sounds of jubilation. And then I woke. The rose-white moon above Bloomed on my sight;â And in her train the stars of winter drove, Light upon light; While Yuletide bells rocked, pealing âpeace and loveâ Down all the aisles of night. GRAMARYE There are some things that entertain me more Than men or books; and to my knowledge seem A key of Poetry, made of magic lore Of childhood, opening many a fabled door Of superstition, mystery, and dream Enchantment locked of yore. For, when through dusking woods my pathway lies, Often I feel old spells, as o'er me flits The bat, like some black thought that, troubled, flies Round some dark purpose; or before me cries The owl that, like an evil conscience, sits, A shadowy voice and eyes. Then, when down blue canals of cloudy snow The white moon oars her boat, and woods vibrate With crickets, lo, I hear the hautboys blow Of Elfland; and, when gold the fireflies glow, See where the goblins hold a Fairy FÃªte With many a lanthorn-row. Strange growths, that ooze from long-dead logs and spread A creamy fungus, where the snail, uncoiled, And fat slug feed at morn, are Pixy bread Made of the yeasted dew; the lichens red, Beside these grown, are meat the Brownies broiled Above a glow-worm bed. The smears of silver on the webs that line The knuckled roots, or stretch, white-wov'n, within The hollow stump, are stains of Faery wine Spilled on the cloth where Elfland sat to dine, When night beheld them drinking, chin to chin, Of th' moon's fermented shine. What but their chairs the mushrooms on the lawn, Or toadstools hidden under flower and fern, Tagged with the dotting dew!âWith knees updrawn Far as his eyes, have I not come upon Puck seated there? but scarcely round could turn When, presto! he was gone. And so though Science from the woods hath tracked The Elfin; and with prosy lights of day Unhallowed all his haunts; and, dulling, blacked Our vision, still hath Beauty never lacked For seers yet; who, in some wizard way, Prove fancy real as fact. THE WORLD OF FAERY I When in the pansy-purpled stain Of sunset one far star is seen, Like one bright drop of rain, Out of the forest, deep and green, O'er me a Spirit seems to lean, The fairest of her train. II The Spirit, dowered with fadeless youth Of Lay and Legend, young as when, Close to her side, in sooth, She led me from the marts of men, A child, into her world, which then To me was true as truth. III Her hair is like the silken husk That holds the corn, the gloss that glows; Her brow is white as tusk; Her body is like some sweet rose, And through her gossamer raiment shows Like starlight closed in musk. IV She smiles at me; she nods at me; And by her looks I am beguiled Into the mystery Of ways I knew when, as a child, She led me 'mid her blossoms wild Of faery fantasy. V The blossoms that, when night is here, Become sweet mouths that sigh soft tales; Or, each, a jeweled ear Leaned to the elfin dance that trails Down moonrayed cirques of haunted vales To cricket song and cheer. VI The blossoms that, closed up all day,â Primrose and poppy,âdarkness opes, Slowly, to free a fay, Who, silken-soft, leaps forth and ropes With rain each web that, starlit, slopes Between each grassy spray. VII The blossoms from which elves are born,â Sweet wombs of mingled scent and snow, Whose deeps are cool as morn; Wherein I oft have heard them blow Their pixy trumpets, silvery low As some bee's drowsy horn. VIII So was it when my childhood roamed The woodland's dim enchanted ground, Where every mushroom domed Its disc for them to revel round; Each glow-worm forged its flame,âgreen-drowned In hollow snow that foamed IX Of lilies,âfor their lantern light, To lamp their dance beneath the moon; Each insect of the night,â That rasped its thin, vibrating tune,â And owl that raised its sleepy croon, Made music for their flight. X So is it still when twilight fills My soul with childhood's memories That haunt the far-off hills, And people with dim things the trees,â With faery forms that no man sees, And dreams that no man kills. XI Then all around me sway and swing The Puck-lights of their firefly train, Their elfin revelling; And in the bursting pods, that rain Their seeds around my steps, again I hear their footsteps ring. XII The faery feet that fall once more Within my way;âand then I see,â As oft I saw before,â Her Spirit rise, who shimmeringly Fills all my world with poetry,â The Loveliness of Yore. THERE ARE FAIRIES I There are fairies, bright of eye, Who the wildflowers' warders are: Ouphes, that chase the firefly, Elves, that ride the shooting-star: Fays, who in a cobweb lie, Swinging on a moonbeam bar; Or who harness bumble-bees, Grumbling on the clover leas, To a blossom or a breeze, That's their fairy car. If you care, you too may see There are fairies.âVerily, There are fairies. II There are fairies. I could swear I have seen them busy, where Roses loose their scented hair, In the moonlight weaving, weaving, Out of starlight and the dew, Glinting gown and shimmering shoe; Or, within a glow-worm lair, From the dark earth slowly heaving Mushrooms whiter than the moon, On whose tops they sit and croon, With their grig-like mandolins, To fair fairy ladykins, Leaning from the window-sill Of a rose or daffodil, Listening to their serenade All of cricket music made. Follow me, oh, follow me! Ho! away to Faerie! Where your eyes like mine may see There are fairies.âVerily, There are fairies. III There are fairies. Elves that swing In a wild and rainbow ring Through the air; or mount the wing Of a bat to courier news To the fairy King and Queen: Fays, who stretch the gossamers On which twilight hangs the dews; Who, within the moonlight sheen, Whisper dimly in the ears Of the flowers words so sweet That their hearts are turned to musk And to honey; things that beat In their veins of gold and blue: Ouphes, that shepherd moths of duskâ Soft of wing and gray of hueâ Forth to pasture on the dew. There are fairies; verily; Verily; For the old owl in the tree, Hollow tree, He who maketh melody For them tripping merrily, Told it me. There are fairies.âVerily, There are fairies. ON MIDSUMMER NIGHT I All the poppies, in their beds Nodding crumpled, crimson heads; And the larkspurs, in whose ears Twilight hangs, like twinkling tears, Sleepy jewels of the rain; All the violets, that strain Eyes of amaranthine gleam; And the clover-blooms that dream With pink baby-fists closed tight,â They can hear upon this night, Noiseless as the moon's white light, Footsteps and the glimmering flight, Shimmering flight, Of the Fairies. II Every sturdy four-o'-clock, In its variegated frock; Every slender sweet-pea, too, In its hood of pearly hue; Every primrose pale that dozes By the wall and slow uncloses A sweet mouth of dewy dawn In a little silken yawn,â On this night of silvery sheen, They can see the Fairy Queen, On her palfrey white, I ween, Tread dim cirques of haunted green, Moonlit green, With her Fairies. III Never a foxglove-bell, you see, That's a cradle for a bee; Never a lily, that's a house Where the butterfly may drowse; Never a rose-bud or a blossom, That unfolds its honeyed bosom To the moth, that nestles deep And there sucks itself to sleep,â But can hear and also see, On this night of witchery, All that world of Faerie, All that world where airily, Merrily, Trip the Fairies. IV It was last Midsummer Night, In the moon's uncertain light, That I stood among the flowers, And, in language unlike ours, Heard them speaking of the Pixies, Trolls and Gnomes and Water-Nixes; How in this flow'r's ear a Fay Hung a gem of rainy ray; And round that flow'r's throat had set, Dim, a dewdrop carcanet; Then among the mignonette Stretched a cobweb-hammock wet, Dewy wet, For the Fairies. V Long I watched, but never a one, Ariel, Puck, or Oberon, Mab, or Queen Titaniaâ Fairest of them all they sayâ Clad in morning-glory hues, Did I glimpse among the dews. Only once I thought the torch Of that elfin-rogue and arch, Robin Goodfellow, afar Flashed along a woodland barâ Bright, a jack-o'-lantern star, A green lamp of firefly spar, Glow-worm spar, Loved of Fairies. THE DANCE OF THE FAIRIES On the glimmering coppice, From her shadowy hair, Long, silvery poppies Of moon-litten air The Night hath flung there. In the fern-fronded hollow The fireflies stream, Uncertainly follow, With lanterns of gleam, Some spirit or dream. The forest is fragrant; The night-hazes swirl And trail,âthrough the vagrant Deep ferns that unfurl,â Faint footsteps of pearl. From hill and from valley, Where the moon is at home; From rocks,âmusically,â Where singing streams comb Wild tresses of foam; With a ripple and twinkle Of luminous arms, And footfalls that tinkle The darkness, in swarms Of flower-like forms: We speed to the revel From bloom and from brier, With locks that dishevel, And feet, like the fire, Winged wild with desire. Like the wind on the mountain, We circle and dance; Like the foam of the fountain, That sings of romance, We glimmer and glance. Swift, swift we go swinging Down the slanted moonbeam, In spirals faint flinging A rainbow-rayed gleam On sward and on stream. You may hear, like a murmur, The swirl of our hair; Our footfall; no firmer Than leaves on the air When branches blow bare. To men who are favored In spiritual wise, Whose hearts have not quavered To see us, we rise And doff all disguise. Come away then, come hither, In the moon-blossomed night! Ere the star-flowers wither, And Morning, the white, Reaps, mows them with light. Come hither, where singing Sounds softer than tears, Or kisses, sweet clinging, Or music one hears With memory's ears. Come join us, whose kisses Are waiting for you; Come, catch at our tresses, And dance through the dew! Come away, and pursue! Come, come to the coppice, The violet ridge; The torrent, whose top is A rainbow,âa bridge We tread like the midge.â Come, mortal, come hither! Come dance with your dreams, Ere the golden spark wither Of the glow-worm that gleams Like a star in still streams. THE CHANGELING In the night I heard the sea; Saw the round moon, white as wool, Or a bloom in Faerie, Rise above the hawthorn-tree, White and wonderful, Weird and wonderful. Through the door there came to me Breezy whispers, fragrant as Wafts that rock the honey-bee, Cradled sweet in Arcady, In the bluebelled grass, In the rose-strewn grass. Then I saw them; suddenly; Three red caps against the moon;â And three voices whispered me, âWe have come to dance for thee, Sing for thee a tune, Sing an elfin tune.â They were Fairies, Fairies three: Nearer to my crib they drew, Singing all the time to me, Till mine eyes closed dreamily, Closed, and naught I knew, And no more I knew. While I slept I heard the three Whispering round my baby there, White as moonlit ivory, In its crib of ebony, All my joy and care, All my love and care. Now I sit here, as you see, And my heart is all bereft, Sighing, singing wearily To this strange thing on my knee, This wild thing they left, Changeling that they left. THE ELF-QUEEN You ask me why I wandered wide When Summer sighed o'er dying June?â To see the Fairy People ride Beneath the moon. Wild poppies hedged a hawthorne copse, Where glow-worms hung dim lamps of gold; A sudden whisper bowed their tops, And then, behold! Between the poppies and the mead I saw the Fairies riding down: One fair-faced Fairy in the lead Crowned with a crown. The night was ringing with their reins, So loud the cricket hushed its song; Bells up and down their horses' manes Swung sweet along. And whistles, that took all the wind With music when they shook their manes; So that the fields, before, behind, Rang with sweet strains. And as their bridles chiming swung, The night seemed cured of every qualm; And my sick heart, so wild of tongue, Was almost calm. The steeds they rode were fairy steeds, Of filmy form and gossamer green; And every elf was clad in weeds Of silken sheen. Above, a beam of silver light Beat time to their wild fairy tune, And danced and glanced,âan elfin white Not of the moon. They were so small the harebell's blue Had helmeted each tiny head, Save that fair Fay, who, tall as two, The Fairies led. Dark tresses floated from a tire Of diamond sparks that snapped with light; And all her white sark seemed of fire Shimmering the night. I would have thrown me at her feet And told her of my grief and pain; And she, perhaps, had helped me meet My love again. Alas! a cock crew far away, A long-necked cry; and, swift as thought, The Elf-Queen and her company Passed into naught. SONG OF THE ELF I Where the poppies, with their shields, Sentinel Forest and the harvest fields, In the bell Of a blossom, fair to see, There I stall the bumblebee, My good stud; There I stable him and hold, Harness him with hairy gold; There I ease his burly back Of the honey and its sack Filched from bloom and bud. II Where the glow-worm lights its lamp, There I lie; Where, above the grasses damp, Moths go by; Now within the fussy brook, Where the waters wind and crook Round the rocks, I go sailing down the gloom Straddling light a wisp of broom; Or, beneath the owlet moon, Trip it to the cricket's tune Tossing back my locks. III Ere the crowfoot on the lawn Lifts its head, Or the glow-worm's light be gone, Dim and dead, In a cobweb-hammock I Swing between two ferns and lie Hid away; Where the drowsy musk-rose blows And a sleepy runnel flows, In the land of Faery, There I rock, where none can see, All the summer day. AN ELF SWASHBUCKLER Ho, my bullies, lift a tune To Queen Mab, and, come, make merry, By a mushroom in the moon, White as bud of berry! Gentlemen, come! take your grog! Each one in his cap and mantlet: Who refuses is a dog!â He must lift my gantlet! Look! my gaberdine how brave! And my tunic, ouphen yellow! One a bat's-wing lately gave, And a frog its fellow. And a moth's-head grew this fine Feather of my beetle-bonnet; See, my gnat-sting dagger's shine Hath its blood still on it. Faith! this ring I wear, I swear, 'Twas Queen Mab who gave it: studded, As you see, with rubies rareâ Eyes of spiders blooded. Doubt me, sirs, and by my blade!â Sirrahs, a good stabbing hanger! From a hornet's stinger made!â You may dread my anger! Fill the lichen pottles up, Honey pressed from hearts of roses: Cheek by jowl, up with each cup, Till we hide our noses. Good, sirs!âMarry!â'Twas the cock!â Hey, away! the moon's lost fire!â Ho! the cock! our dial and clockâ Hide beneath this brier! ON THE EVE OF ST. JOHN (Scandinavian) Dizzily round, On the elf-hills, white in the mellow moonlight, To a sweet, unholy, ravishing sound Of wizard voices from underground, Their mazy dance the Elle-maids wound On St. John's Eve. Beautiful white, Like a wreath of mist by the starbeams kissed, Their frail, sweet faces bloomed out of the night, With floating tresses of firefly light, That puffed like foam to the left and the right, On St. John's Eve. Fitfully there They danced like the daughters of starlit waters,â But I saw what a mockery all of them were, With their hollow bodies, when the moonlit air Rayed out of their eyes with a glow-worm glare, On St. John's Eve. I turned my feet To the river's banks: in the rush-flowers' ranks I heard the Necken their songs repeat: A music all made of the water's beat, Of moss and of whispering winds that meet, On St. John's Eve. They called my name; And I saw them there, in their beauty rare, On the moonlit waves whence the music came, With their harps of gold, and their locks of flame Blown over pale brows, sans sin or blame, On St. John's Eve. 'Twas nearing morn When I turned me home; and a wizen'd gnome, A Nis, all gray with flailing the corn, And strong with the scent of byre and barn, Scowled at me under the haunted thorn, On St. John's Eve. To end it all, As I passed the hill by the ruined mill, The hill rose up on pillars tall, Crimson pillars that ranked a hall, Where the Dwarfs and the Trolls were holding a ball, On St. John's Eve. One reached to me A goblet of gold of a vintage old, And I drank, and mixed with their mirth and glee, And danced with them for an hour, may be.â But they tell me now 'tis a year, you see, Since St. John's Eve. THE NIXIES Deep down, beneath the waves, Great emerald-curving caves Dark-domed above it, Dim-walled with pearl and gold Glimmers their city oldâ Hast thou heard of it?â Where, through the long green nights, the spangling spars Twinkle like misty stars. Where the wind-ripple rays, And the white water sprays Over the rocks, Sitting, they comb their hair; Singing, with fingers fair Braiding their locks; While round their loveliness of naked limbs The moon's gold glamour swims. Or, on some stormy night, Seen through the glow-worm light Haunting the sands, Thou canst behold them drift Wild thro' the foam, and lift Pale arms and hands; Or, in the lightning's leap, along the lake, Dance in the tempest's wake. Singing: âCome join our dance! Come, while the lightnings glance, Or when the moon Spills all her flowers of light At the dark feet of night; And soon, ah, soon, Within our shadowy halls thou shalt forget Earth's fever and its fret.â THE WATER-FAIRY Stars above her, stars beneath, White she rose, as white as death, Where the waters glassed the splendor Of a thousand thousand stars, Twinkling where the lilies slender Rocked above the ripple-bars. Slow she oared a shining shoulder To a blossom-crested boulder. With slim fingers, long and milky, From the wave and water-lilies, Up the rock she drew her silky Beauty, wild as any rill is Flashing from a hilly height. Sitting, dripping in the night, Sweet she sang unto the lilies, Sang unto the listening lilies, Till arose the wool-white moon In the silken hush of heaven; Then she wreathed her brow with seven Lily-buds, all sweet with June; Belted, wreathed with lilies seven, Then again upon the boulder, Dark locks on a milk-white shoulder, Wild she sang; a wilder ditty To the wool-white moon; To the lilies and the moon: Beautiful and without pity, Sang, and sang an elfin tune; Till a youth, who wandered far, Saw her sitting like a star; Heard her singing to the moon; Found her sitting, starry white, On the flower-crested boulder, Dark locks on a milky shoulder, In the low moon's lilied light, 'Neath the wool-white moon. . . . And the creature wrapped her hair Round his white throat, sitting there Singing, smiled into his eyes, While she wrapped her raven hair Slowly round his throat; and then Laughed and whispered to the skies, Kissed him once and then again; Smiled; and left him stark and strangled In the water-lilies tangled, Staring up, with open eyes, At the moon with open eyes. THE MORNING-GLORIES They swing from the garden-trellis In Ariel-airy ease; And their aromatic honey Is sought by the earliest bees. The rose, it knows their secret, And the jessamine also knows: And the rose told me the secret, That the jessamine told the rose. And the jessamine said: At midnight, Ere the red cock woke and crew, The Fays of Queen Titania Came here to bathe i' the dew. And the yellow moonlight glistened On braids of elfin hair: And fairy feet on the flowers Fell lighter than any air. And their petticoats, gay as bubbles, They hung up, every one, On the morning-glory's tendrils, Till their moonlight bath were done. But the barn-cock crew too early, And the Fairies fled in fear, Leaving their petticoats, one and all, Like blossoms hanging here. THE GLADIOLES As tall as the lily, as rich as the rose, And deep as the bloom of the hollyhock, They lift their blossoms in furbelows Of flame that the warm winds rock. And some are red as the humming-bird's throat, And some are pied as the butterfly's wings, And each is shaped like an elfin coat, Or a goblin cap that swings. Freaked with fire or red as blood, They nod at me in my garden old, Each flower a pixy helm or hood, Lace-lined with fairyland gold. For you know the goblins that come at dusk,â Whose firefly eyes you have seen,âeach one, (When is sprinkled the dew and scattered the musk,) Hangs here his cap when done. THE TIGER-LILY Tall in his tawny turban, A sultan 'mid his bands, In my garden, old and urban, The tiger-lily stands. The poppies there that glisten, Whose gaudy garments glow, Are eunuchs who guard and listen Round his seraglio Of roses, myrrhed and musky; Some whiter than a dove, And others, deep and dusky, His odalisks of love. Circassian-white and slender, His dancing-girls and slaves, To the August-lilies tender, His haughty hand he waves. While he watches them, nothing missing, In her bower of bloom on high, His favorite rose is kissing A Bedouin butterfly. THE MOTH, THE ROSE, AND THE PINK White as snow I saw it sink On the pungent-petaled pink Through the moonlit dusk; Moth? or fairy? or, who knows?â Ghost, perhaps, of some dead rose 'Mid the roses' musk. Then it seemed I heard a sweet Tinkle as of elfin feet Underneath the blooms, Where one rose hung desolate, Sick of heart and filled with hate, Dead with its perfumes. âThou, for whom I died to-day,â So I seemed to hear it say, âListen, lovely pink: Vampire-like, unto thy heart Now I send, through my white art, My pale ghost to drink.â GLAMOUR With fall on fall, from wood to wood, The brook pours mossy music downâ Or is it, in the solitude, The murmur of a Faery town? A town of Elfland filled with bells And holiday of hurrying feet: Or traffic now, whose small sound swells, Now sinks from busy street to street. Whose Folk I often recognize In wingÃ©d things that hover round, Who to men's eyes assume disguise When on some Faery errand bound.â The bee, that haunts the touch-me-not, Big-bodied, making braggart din, Is elfin brother to that sot, Jack Falstaff of the Boar's Head Inn. The dragon-fly, whose wings of black Are mantle for his garb of green, Is Ancient to this other Jack, Another Pistol, long and lean. The butterfly, in royal tints, Is Hal, mad Hal in cloth of gold, Who passes these, as once that Prince Passed his companions boon of old. FAERY MORRIS I The winds are whist; and, hid in mist, The moon hangs o'er the wooded height: The bushy bee, with unkempt head, Hath made the sunflower's disk his bed, And sleeps half-hid from sight. The owlet makes us melodyâ Come dance with us in Faery, Come dance with us to-night. II The dew is damp; the glow-worm's lamp Blurs in the moss its tawny light: The great gray moth sinks, half-asleep, Where, in an elfin-laundered heap, The lily-gowns hang white. The crickets make us minstrelsyâ Come dance with us in Faery, Come dance with us to-night. III With scents of heat, dew-chilled and sweet, The new-cut hay smells by the bight: The ghost of some dead pansy bloom The butterfly seems, in the gloom, Its pied wings folded tight. The world is drowned in fantasyâ Come dance with us in Faery, Come dance with us to-night. THE LITTLE PEOPLE I When the lily nods in slumber, And the roses are all sleeping; When the night hangs deep and umber, And the stars their watch are keeping: When the clematis uncloses Like a hand of snowy fire; And the golden-lipped primroses, To the tiger-moths' desire, Each a mouth of musk unpuckersâ Silken pouts of scented sweetness, Which they sip with honey-suckers:â Shod with hush and winged with fleetness, You may see the Little People, Round and round the drowsy steeple Of a belfried hollyhock,â Clad in phlox and four-o'-clock, Gay of gown and pantaloon,â Dancing by the glimmering moon, Till the cock, the long-necked cock, Crows them they must vanish soon. II When the cobweb is a cradle For the dreaming dew to sleep in; And each blossom is a ladle That the perfumed rain lies deep in: When the flaming fireflies scribble Darkness as with lines flame-tragic, And the night seems some dim sibyl Speaking gold, or wording magic Silent-syllabled and golden: Capped with snapdragon and hooded With the sweet-pea, vague-beholden, You may see the Little People Underneath the sleepy steeple Of a towering mullein stock, Trip it over moss and rock To the owlet's elvish tune, And the tree-toad's gnome-bassoon; Till the cock, the barnyard cock, Crows them they must vanish soon. III When the wind upon the water Seems a boat of ray and ripple, That some fairy moonbeam-daughter Steers, with sails that drift and dripple; When the sound of grig and cricket, Ever singing, ever humming, Seems a goblin in the thicket On his elfin viol strumming; When the toadstool, coned and milky, Heaves a roof for snails to clamber, Thistledown- and milkweed-silky, With loose locks of jade and amber, You may see the Little People, Underneath the pixy steeple Of a domÃ©d mushroom, flock, Quaint in wildflower vest and frock, Whirling by the waning moon To the whippoorwill's weird tune, Till the cock, the far-off cock, Crows them they must vanish soon. THE SEA-KING In green sea-caverns dim, Deep down, Foam-bearded,âgray and grim Beneath his crown,â He sits where sea-things swim And dead men frown. In green sea-caverns dim Deep down. Around him mermaids sing, Foam-clad, And comb long locks and cling, And sing so sad Their song's wild murmuring Drives mortals mad. Around him mermaids sing, Foam-clad. There vast the sea-snakes lair And yawn; Great bulks cloud by; and there Huge shells and spawn, Weird weeds, fantastic fair, Drift scarlet wan. There vast the sea-snakes lair And yawn. Of wrecks of ships and hulls And bones, Sunk gold the water dulls, And precious stones, Anchors, and deadmen's skulls, He builds gaunt thrones. Of wrecks of ships and hulls And bones. Men's tears are dear to him, Deep down. Set in the foamy rim Of his pale crown, Their pearlÃ©d sorrows swim Above his frown. Men's tears are dear to him, Deep down. For him no tempests sweep And sever The league-long waves that leap; The sun shines never: In caverns vast and deep He sits forever. For him no tempests sweep, Never, ah, never. THE NEREID I I saw one night a Nereid white Arise from her coral caves: Her sea-green curls were pale with pearls, And her limbs were veiled with the waves. Through the moonlit foam I saw her come Up the billow-haunted shoreâ And faint and sweet I heard her feet, Foam-like, through the surf's long roar; While ever the wind and the rolling waves Kept time to her song of ocean caves, That she sang to her harp of mist and moon, Of moonbeam shell: this ocean tune:â II âCome follow, come follow, to caverns hollow, That sound with the sighing sea! Come follow me o'er the waters hoar!â Come away, come away with me! Come follow, oh, follow, to grottoes hollow, And caves that are ocean-whist, Where the sea-weeds twine and the star-fish shine, And the rosy corals twist. âCome follow me home on the wandering foam, That rolls my world above! My bosom shall bear thee safely where The Sea-nymphs dream of love. They will lie at thy feet and thy heart shall beat To the music of their sighs; They will lean to thy face and, like stars, thou shalt trace Their radiant, love-lit eyes. âCome away, come away! where, under the spray, The haliÃ¶tis glows, The nautilus gleams and the sponge-grove dreams, And the crimson dulse like sunset streams, And the coral-forest grows. Come away to my caves, my emerald caves, From the moon and the sun deep hid! Forget the world, down under the waves,â The world of man that sighs and slaves,â Forget the world, there under the waves, In the arms of a Nereid!â THE MERMAID The moon in the east was glowing When I sought the moaning sea; The winds from the sea were blowing, And they brought strange dreams to me. The waves at my feet were breaking; The stars in the sky were wan; And I watched a white mist making For the shore and glimmering on. And was it a sound of wailing That the sea-wind bore to me? Did I hear a footstep trailing? Or was it a wave of the sea? The night hung pale above me Upon her starry throne, And a voice said, âYouth, come love me! For my heart for thee makes moan.â And out of the mist came slipping A mermaid, tall and fair; Her limbs with sea-dew dripping, And moonlight in her hair. Her locks, with the salt sea dripping, She wrung with a snowy hand; Her gown hung, thinly clipping Her breasts the sea-wind fanned. Amort from the sea came speeding This creature samite-clad; And my heart for her was bleeding, But its beating I forbade. On the strand where the sand was rocking She stood and sang an air; And the winds in her hair kept locking Their fingers cool and bare. Soft in her arms did she fold me, And evermore she moaned, While her love and her grief she told me, And the ocean sighed and groaned. But I stilled my heart's wild beating, For I knew her love was dim; Oh, cold, oh, cold was my greeting, Though my love burnt in each limb. To her bosom white she pressed me With arms of foam and mist; With her arms and her lips caressed me, And smiled in my eyes and kissed. But ever I kept repeating, âA mermaid false is she!â And cold, oh, cold was my greeting, Though the heart beat wild in me. To my ears she laid her sighing Sweet mouth, like a rosy shell; Her arms round my neck were lying, And her bosom rose and fell. With her kisses soft did she woo me, But I hushed my heart's wild beat; With her lips and her eyes did she sue me, But met in my own defeat. With the cloud of her sea-dipped tresses She veiled her beautiful faceâ And, oh, how I longed for her kisses, And sighed for her soft embrace! But out in the mist she went wailing When dawn besilvered the night, Her robes of samite trailing The foam-flowers, sad and white. Like a spirit lost went sighing In the twilight over the sea; And it seemed the night was cryingâ Or was it the heart in me? Then she turned to me and, weeping, Faded into the night; And I saw the wild waves leaping Under the haunted height. I heard a far-off sobbing, A sound of agonyâ Oh, was it the ocean throbbing? Or was it the heart in me? But I hushed my heart's wild beating, With âa mermaid false is she!â While ever I kept repeating, âWould she'd return to me!â Oh, heart, so full of yearning For a loveliness that's gone, A beauty unreturning, Be still! or break with dawn! CHILDREN O' THE MOON I To-night, perhaps, after the rain is done, Led by a moonbeam or the flickering torch The firefly flares, amid the loneliness, The hereditary loneliness of the trees, I, too, may see,âas sees the star that peeps Through interlacing boughs, the toadstools heave Their white roofs through the ferns, like goblin huts, An elfin town; and, squatting on their tops, Punch-bellied things, peak-kneed, their knees updrawn To perpendicular eyes of glow-worm flame, And arms akimbo i' the light o' the moon, Watching the dew-drops tag the toadstools' rims, Or from the mushroom roll the orbÃ©d rain: Or, where the tall weed drips and spunkwood smells Make musk the underwoods, slim woodland imps,â Snail-eyed, frog-footed,âoust the sleeping bees From rocking cradles of the wild flowers' bells Belfrying, with foxglove-purple, a moonbeam space. II On the road in the April wood, Under the oaks I stopped and stood, Watching the mole that stealthily heaved The soft loose clay of its barrow: The oaks above were auburn-leaved; And near me bloomed the yarrow; When down from a leaf a gray snail fell, Its long stilt-eyes thrust out of its shell: And I thought, âThis color is worn of the fays, Whose fashion runs to dimmish grays: A snail-brown tunic each elfin eunuch Wears in the harem the Elf King keeps: And a snail-gray gown each fairy clown Dons when the elf dance whirls and leaps In the light of the moon on the upland down. A snail-shell house for his ouphen spouse Each elfin builds by the snail-white moon, Where his fairykin love he boards and beds, Under the dandelion's wisp-white heads, Where ever he pipes his cricket tune. III The sphinx-moth, clothed in downy hues, In woolly whites and fawns and blues, Goes fluttering through the evening dews. Above the nicotiana's blooms' Narcotic horns it waves its plumes, Made drowsy with the drugged perfumes. It seems some Fairy Queen who goes 'Mid trumpets lifted in long rows Of white whereon the Elfworld blows. Attendant and triumphant strains Of fragrance, greeting her who reigns, Who takes the air in fairy lanes Of flowers, that the moonlight stains. A MOTIVE IN GOLD AND GRAY I To-night he sees their star bead, dewy bright, Deep in the pansy, eve hath made for it, Low in the westâa placid purple lit At its far edge with warm auroral light: Love's planet hangs above a cedared height; And there in shadow, like gold music writ Of dusk's dark fingers, scale-like fireflies flit Now up, now down the balmy bars of night. How different from that eve a year ago! Which was a stormy flower in the hair Of dolorous day, whose sombre eyes looked blurred Into night's sibyl face, and saw the woe Of parting here, and imaged a despair, As now a hope caught from a homing word. II She came unto himâas the springtime does Unto the land where all lies dead and cold, Until her rosary of days is told And beauty, prayer-like, blossoms where death was.â Nature divined her coming; yea, the dusk Seemed thinking of that happiness: behold, No cloud it had to blot its marigold Moonâgreat and goldenâo'er the slopes of musk; Whereon earth's voice made music; tree and stream Lilting the same low lullaby again, To coax the wind, who romped among the hills All dayâa tired childâto sleep and dream: When through the moonlight of the locust-lane She came, as spring comes through her daffodils. III White as a lily molded of Earth's milk That eve the moon bloomed in a hyacinth sky; Soft in the gleaming glens the wind went by, Faint as a phantom clothed in unseen silk: Bright as a Naiad's limbs, from shine to shade The runnel twinkled through the shaken brier; Above the hills one long cloud, pulsed with fire, Flashed like a great enchantment-welded blade. And when the western sky seemed some weird land, And night a witch's spell, at whose command One sloping star fell green from heav'n; and deep The warm rose opened, for the moth to sleep; Then she, consenting, laid her hands in his, And lifted up her lips for their first kiss. IV There where they part the porch's steps are strewn With wind-dropped petals of the purple vine; Athwart the porch the shadow of a pine Cleaves the white moonlight; and, like some calm rune Heaven says to Earth, shines the majestic moon; And now a meteor draws a lilac line Across the welkin, as if God would sign The perfect poem of this night of June. The wood-wind stirs the flowering chestnut-tree, Whose curving blossoms strew the glimmering grass Like crescents that wind-wrinkled waters glass; And, like a moonstone in a frill of flame, The dewdrop trembles in the peony, As in a lover's heart his sweetheart's name. V In after years shall she stand here again, In heart regretful? and with lonely sighs Think on that night of love, and realize Whose was the fault whence grew the parting pain? And, in her soul, persuading still in vain, Shall doubt take shape, and all its old surmise Bid darker phantoms of remorse arise Trailing the raiment of a dead disdain? Masks, unto whom shall her avowal yearn With looks clairvoyant, seeing how each is A different form with eyes and lips that burn Into her heart with love's last look and kiss?â And, ere they pass, shall she behold them turn To her a face which evermore is his? VI In after years shall he remember how Dawn had no breeze sweet as her murmured name? And day no sunlight that availed the same As her bright smile or beauty of her brow? Nor had the conscious twilight's golds and grays Her soul's allurement, that was free from blame,â Nor dusk's advances, soft with starry flame, More young bewitchment than her own sweet ways.â Then as the night with moonlight and perfume, And dew and darkness, qualifies the whole Dim world with glamour, shall the past with dreamsâ That were the love-theme of their livesâillume The present with remembered hours, with gleams, Long lost to him, that bring them soul to soul? VII No! not for her and him that partâthe Might- Have-Been's sad consolation! where had bent, Haply, in prayer and patience penitent, Both, though apart, before no blown-out light. The otherwise of fate for them, when white The lilacs bloom again, and, innocent, Spring comes with beauty for her testament, Singing the praises of the day and night. When orchards blossom and the distant hill Is pale with haw-trees as a ridge with mist, The moon shall see him where a watch he keeps By her young form that lieth white and still, With lidded eyes and passive wrist on wrist, While by her side he bows himself and weeps. VIII What pain for him to see the blooms appear Of haw and dogwood in the spring again; The primrose dragging with its weight of rain, And hill-sloped orchards swarming far and near. To see the old fields, that her steps made dear, Grow green with deepening plenty of the grain, Yet feel how this excess of life is vain,â How vain to him!âsince she no more is here. What though the woodland bourgeon, water flow, Like a rejoicing harp, beneath the boughs! The cat-bird and the oriole arouse Day with the impulsive music of their love! Beneath the graveyard sod she will not know, Nor what his heart is all too conscious of! IX How bless'd is he who, gazing in the tomb, Can yet behold beneath the investing mask Of mockery,âwhose horror seems to ask Sphinx-riddles of the soul within the gloom,â Upon dead lips no dust of Love's dead bloom; And in dead hands no shards of Faith's rent flask; But Hope, who still stands at her starry task, Weaving the web of promise on her loom! Thrice bless'd! who, 'though he hear the tomb proclaim How all is Death's and Life Death's other name, Can yet reply: âO Grave, these things are yours! But that is left which life indeed assuresâ Love, through whose touch I shall arise the same! Love, of whose self was wrought the universe!â INTIMATIONS I Is it uneasy moonlight, On the restless field, that stirs? Or wild white meadow-blossoms The night-wind bends and blurs? Is it the dolorous water, That sobs in the wood and sighs? Or heart of an ancient oak-tree, That breaks and, sighing, dies? The wind is vague with the shadows That wander in No-Man's-Land; The water is dark with the voices That weep on the Unknown's strand. O ghosts of the winds that call me! O ghosts of the whispering waves! Sad as forgotten flowers That die upon nameless graves! What is this thing you tell me In tongues of a twilight race, Of death, with the vanished features, Mantled, of my own face? II The old enigmas of the deathless dawns, And riddles of the all immortal eves,â That still o'er Delphic lawns Speak as the gods spoke through oracular leavesâ I read with new-born eyes, Remembering how, a slave, They buried me, a living sacrifice, Once in a dead king's grave. Or, crowned with hyacinth and helichrys, How, towards the altar in the marble gloom,â Hearing the magadis Dirge through the pale amaracine perfume,â 'Mid chanting priests I trod, With never a sigh or pause, To give my life to pacify a god, And save my country's cause. Again: Cyrenian roses on wild hair, And oil and purple smeared on breasts and cheeks, How, with mad torches there,â Reddening the cedars of CithÃ¦ron's peaks,â With gesture and fierce glance, Lascivious MÃ¦nad bands Once drew and slew me in the Pyrrhic dance With Bacchanalian hands. III The music now that lays Dim lips against my ears, Some far-off thing it says,â Unto my soul,âof years Long passed into the haze Of tears. Meseems before me are The dark eyes of a queen, A queen of Istakhar: I seem to see her lean More lovely than a star Of mien. A slave, I stand before Her jeweled throne; I kneel, And, in a song, once more My love for her reveal; How once I did adore I feel. Again her dark eyes gleam; Again her red lips smile; And in her face the beam Of love that knows no guile; And so she seems to dream A while. Out of her deep hair then A rose she takesâand I Am made a god 'mid men! Her rose, that here did lie When I, in th' wild-beasts' den, Did die. IV Old paintings on its wainscots, And, in its oaken hall, Old arras; and the twilight Of sorrow over all. Old grandeur on its stairways; And in its haunted rooms Old souvenirs of greatness, And ghosts of dead perfumes. The winds are phantom voices Around its carven doors; The moonbeams, specter footsteps Upon its polished floors. Old cedars build around it A solitude of sighs; And the old hours pass through it With immemorial eyes. But more than this I know not; Nor where the house may be; Nor what its ancient secret And ancient grief to me. It seems my soul remembers,â Of which this house is part,â Once, in a former lifetime, 'Twas here I broke my heart. V In eons of the senses, My spirit knew of yore, I found the Isle of Circe And felt her magic lore; And still the soul remembers What I was once before. She gave me flowers to smell of That wizard branches bore, Of weird and wondrous beauty, Whose stems dripped human goreâ Their scent when I remember I know that world once more. She gave me fruits to eat of That grew beside the shore, Of necromantic ripeness, With human flesh at coreâ Their taste when I remember I know that life once more. And then, behold! a serpent, That glides my face before, With eyes of tears and fire That glare me o'er and o'erâ I look into its eyeballs, And know myself once more. VI I have looked in the eyes of Poesy, And sat in Song's high place; And the beautiful Spirits of Music Have spoken me face to face; Yet here in my soul there is sorrow They never can name or trace. I have walked with the glamour Gladness, And dreamed with the shadow Sleep; And the presences, Love and Knowledge, Have smiled in my heart's red keep; Yet here in my soul there is sorrow For the depth of their gaze too deep. The love and the hope God grants me, The beauty that lures me on, And the dreams of folly and wisdom That thoughts of the spirit don, Are but masks of an ancient sorrow Of a life long dead and gone. Was it sin? or a crime forgotten? Of a love that loved too well? That sat on a throne of fire A thousand years in Hell? That the soul with its nameless sorrow Remembers but can not tell? SELF AND SOUL It came to me in my sleep, And I rose in my sleep and went Out in the night to weep, Out where the trees were bent. With my soul, it seemed, I stood Alone in a wind-swept wood. And my soul said, gazing at me, âI will show you another land Different from that you see,â And took into hers my hand.â We passed from the wood to a heath As starved as the ribs of Death. There, every leaf and the grass Was a thorn or a thistle hoar, The rocks rose mass on mass, Black bones on an iron moor. And my soul said, looking at me, âThe past of your life you see.â And a swineherd passed with his swine, Deformed, with the face of an owl; Two eyes of a wolfish shine Burned under his eyebrows foul. And my soul said, âThis is the Lust, That soils my beauty with dust.â Then a goose-wife hobbled by, On a crutch, with the devil's geese, A-mumbling that God is a lie, And cursing the world without cease. And my soul said, âThis is Unfaith Who maketh me that which she saith.â Then we came to a garden, close To a hollow of graves and tombs; A garden as red as a rose, Hung over of obscene glooms; The heart of each rose was a spark That smouldered or glared in the dark. And I was aware of a girl With a wild-rose face, who came, With a mouth like a shell's split pearl, Rose-clad in a robe of flame; And she plucked the roses and gave, And I was her veriest slave. She vanished. My lips would have kissed The flowers she gave me with sighs, But they writhed from my hands and hissed, In their hearts were a serpent's eyes. And my soul said, âPleasure is she. The joys of the flesh you see.â Then I bowed with a heart too weary, That longed to rest, to sleep; And it seemed in the darkness dreary I heard my sad heart weep; And my soul to the silence say,â âO God! for the break of day!â THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE Five rotting gables look upon A garden rank with flowers and weeds; Old iron gates on posts of stone, From which the grass-grown roadway leads. Five rotting gable-points appear Above bleak yews and cedars sad, Beneath which lies the sleepy mere In lazy lilies clad. At morn the slender dragon-fly, A living ray of light, darts past; The burly bee comes charging by Winding a surly blast. At noon amid the fervid leaves The insects quarrel, harsh and hot; In bitter briers the spider weaves A web with silver shot. At eve the hermit cricket rears A plaintive prayer, and creaks and creaks; The bat, like some wing'd elfin, veers Beneath the sunset's streaks. The caterpillar gnaws the leaf; The mottled toad croaks drowsily; And then the owl, like some dark grief, Cries in the old beech-tree. At night the blistering dew comes down And lies as white as autumn frost Upon the green, upon the brownâ You'd think each bush a ghost. The crescent moon sheathes its white sword Within a cloud; and, gray with fear, One large blue star keeps stealthy guard Above the house and mere. The livid lilies rotting lie On oozy beds of weltering leaves; The will-o'-wisps go flickering by,â And then the water heaves, And, like some monstrous blossom there, A maiden's corpse with staring eyes, And naked breast and raven hair, Slow in the mere doth rise. And when the clock of some far town Knells midnight, in that house of sins, In haunted chambers, up and down, The dance of death begins; And stiff, stiff silks sweep, rustling, And stately satins none may see; And then soft sounds of music ring In wildest melody. And through the halls the demon dance Whirls onward; and dark corridors Resound with song and feet that glance Along the falling floors. Then suddenly, as if in fear, The music ends, the dance is done; And booming over house and mere A far-off clock strikes one. IN AN OLD GARDEN The autumn glory fades Upon the withered trees; And over all the dead leaves fall And whisper in the breeze. The violets are dead, And dead the hollyhocks, That hang like rags by the wind-crushed flags And tiger-lily stocks. The wild gourd clambers free Where the clematis was wont; Where nenuphars bloomed thick as stars Rank weeds fill up the fount. Yet, as in dreams, I hear A tinkling mandolin In the dark-blue light of a fragrant night Float in and out and in. Till the dewy vine, that climbs To a casement's lattice, sways; And behind the vine, like stars that shine, Two dark eyes gleam and gaze. And now a perfume comes, A swift Favonian gust; And the shrivelled grass, where it doth pass, Bows worshiping to the dust. I seem to see her drift From tree to moonlit tree, In her jewelled shawl divinely tall, A mist of drapery. And one awaits her there By the broken Psyche old; And there they stand, pale hand in hand, Her thin wrists hooped with gold. But a wind sweeps overhead, And the frosty leaves are strewnâ And nothing is there but a bough, blown bare, And the light of the ghostly moon. THE HAUNTED ROOM Its casements, diamond-disked with glass, Look down upon a terrace old, Where urns, unkempt with ragged grass, Foam o'er with hoary cold. The snow rounds out each stair of stone; The frozen fount is hooped with pearl; Down desolate walks, like phantoms blown, Thin, powdery snow-wreaths whirl. And to each rose-tree's stem, that bends With silvery snow-combs, glued with frost, It seems each summer rosebud sends Its airy, scentless ghost. A stiff Elizabethan pile, With bleakness chattering in its panes, Where, rumbling down each chimney-file, The mad wind shakes his reins. Lone in the northern angle, dim With immemorial dust, it lies; Where each gaunt casement's stony rim Stares eyelike at the skies. Drear in the old pile's oldest wing, Hung round with mouldering arras, where Tall, shadowy Tristrams fight and sing For shadowy Isolts fair. Beside a crumbling cabinet A tarnished lute lies on the floor; A talon-footed chair is set, Grotesquely, near the door. A carven, testered bedstead stands With rusty silks draped all about; And, like a moon in murky lands, A mirror glimmers out. Neglected, locked that chamber, where In dropping arras dimly clings The drowsy moth; and, frightened there, The lost wind sighs and sings Adown the roomy flue, and takes And swings the ghostly mirror till It seems some unseen hand that shakes Its frame then leaves it still. A starving mouse forever gnaws Behind a panel; and the vines, That on the casement tap like claws, Lattice the floor with lines.â I have been there when blades of light Stabbed each dull, stained, and dusty pane; Once I was there at dead of nightâ I dream of it again. . . . She grew upon my vision as Heat grows that haunts the summer day; In taffetas, like glimmering glass, She stood there dim and gray. And will-o'-wisp-like jewels bound Faint points of light round neck and wrist; And round her slender waist was wound A zone of silver mist. And icy as some winter land Her pale, still face; o'er which the night Hung of her raven hair; her hand Was beautiful and white. Before the mirror moaningly She wrung her hands and palely pressed Her brow.âAnd did I dream, or see, That blood was on her breast? And then she vanished.âLike a breath, That o'er the limpid glass had passed, Her presence passed; and cold as death She left me and aghast. Yes, I've been there when spears of light Pierced thro' each stained and sunlit pane; Once I was there at dead of nightâ I dream of it again. THE MIRROR An ancient mirror hangs Within an ancient Hall; In a lonely room where th' arrased gloom Scowls from the pictured wall. A mystic mirror, framed In ebon, wildly carved, That seems to stare on the shadows there, Like something lean and starved. A mirror, where one sees In the broad, good light of day, Like crimson torches, at the window arches, Red roses swing and sway. And a part o' the garth is seen, With its quaint stone-dial plate, That, gray and old, green-stained with mold, Stands near the lioned gate. These it reflects all day, And at night one star of blue, That the nightingale, where the rose is pale, Lifts its passionate love-song to. The nightbird sings below; The stars hang bright above; And the roses soon in the sultry moon Shall palpitate with love. The nightbird sobs below; The roses blow and bloom; Through mullioned panes the moonlight rains In the dim, unholy room. Grim ancestors that stare,â Stiff, starched and haughty,âdown From the oaken wall of the noble hall, Put on a sterner frown. The old, hoarse castle-clock Coughs midnight overheadâ And the rose is wan and the bird is gone When walk the shrouded dead. Then from their frames, it seems, The portraits' shadows flit; By the mirror there they stand and stare And weep or sigh to it. In rare rich ermine, earls And knights in gold and vair, With a rapiered throng of courtiers long Pass with a stately stare. With jewels and perfumes, In powder, ruff, and lace, Tall ladies pass by the looking-glass Each sighing at her face. What secret does it hide, This mirror, gaunt and tall, In this lonely room, where th' arrased gloom Scowls from the pictured wall? THE HALL OF DARKNESS Within her veins it beats And burns within her brain, As year by year more sad and sear Grow barren hill and plain. Ah! over young is she Who bears within her breast More pain and woe than women know, And all of love's unrest. Seven towers of shaggy rock Rise black to ragged skies, From out a fen where bones of men Stare with their empty eyes. Eternal sunset pours, Around its warlock towers,â From out its urn of beams that burn,â Long fire-cloudy flowers. On bat-like turrets high, And owlet battlements, Huge condors dream and vultures scream As at the battle's scents. Within the banquet-hall, A bride, rich-robed and pale, She sits at board with men o' the sword Cased all in silver mail. Their visors barred are drawn; Their hands are gauntletÃ©d; And one, behold! in glittering gold Sits at the table's head. Wild music echoes through The hollow-sounding airâ It seems, at least, a wedding feast With richness everywhere. Wild music oozes from The ceiling, groined with white Pure pearl, and floors, like mythic shores, Of limpid chrysolite. Silent they sit at feast, And she, whom he sits near,â He in gold mail,âwhy is she pale, As one with grief and fear? The heav'ns grow slaughter-red, Grow blood-red west and east; Seven casements high that frame the sky Flare on the blood-red feast. Gaunt torches tall they seem, Red revel-torches seven;â And then, behold! the hour is tolled; A great bell strikes eleven. Silence.âThe light, that makes Each plate a splash of fire,â Gold-splintered,âdims; and softer swims The music of each lyre. Grave Silence, like a king, At that strange feast has place; Grave Silence still as God's own will Within the deeps of space. She leans to him in gold, And to him seems to sayâ âThe night grows late, my love! Why wait? Ah God! would it were day! âWould it were day, ah God! How long is it till dawn?â Why wear this mask?âUndo thy casque! The midnight hour comes on!â Silent he sits, severe; Then one sonorous tower, Owl-swarmed, that looms in glaring glooms, Tolls slow the midnight hour. Three strokes; the knights arise, The silence from them flung, Like waves that mock some hoarse sea-rock, Wild laughter moves each tongue. Six strokes; and wailing out The music hoots away; The fiery glimmer of heaven grows dimmer, The red turns ghostly gray. Nine strokes; and, dropping mold, The crumbling Hall is lead; The plate is rust; the feast is dust; The banqueters are dead. Twelve strokes pound out and roll; The vast Hall heaves and waves With things that crawl from floor and wallâ Spawn of a thousand graves. Then rattling in the night His golden visor slipsâ In rotting mail a death's-head pale Kisses her loathing lips. Then over all a voice Crying above the strifeâ âDeath is the Groom: this Hall, the Tomb: The Bride, behold, is Life!â WHAT DREAMS MAY COME I have lain for an hour or twain Awake, and the tempest is beating On the roof and the sleet on the pane, And the winds are three enemies meeting; And I listen and hear it again, My name, in the silence, repeating. Then dumbness of death; and, moon-gray, In the darkness a light like a bubble, From which, like a single white ray, Comes a woman in loveliness double; Her face is the breaking of day, Her eyes are the night and its trouble. I move not; she lies with her lips At mine; and I feel she is drawing My life from my heart to their tips, My heart where the horror is gnawing; My life in a hundred slow sips, My soul with her gaze overawing. She binds me with merciless eyes; She drinks of my blood; and I hear it Drain up with a shudder and rise To the lips, like a serpent's, that steer it; And she lies, and she laughs as she lies, Saying, âLo! thy affinitized spirit.â I prayâand a gate, as of swords,â 'Mid torments and tortures huge-grated, Clangs iron deep under; and words Are heard as of sins that awaited A fiend who lashed into their hordes, And a demon who lacerated. I prayâand lie clammy and stark, As a something mounts higher and higher, Up, out of damnation and dark, With hobbling of hoofs that is dire; A devil, whose breath is a spark, Whose face is of filth and of fire. âTo thy body's corruption! thy grave! Thy hell! from which thou hast stolen!â He snarls; and the night, like a wave, Engulfs them with darkness wild swollen.â Can it be that in sleep I'm a slave Of a thing neither flesh nor eidolon? THAT HOUR When she was dead, a voiceâshe knew not whoseâ Said to her: âSoul that fell, To cheer thee there in Hell, Of all thy life's lost happiness now choose. âAsk what thou wilt, thou, who hast walked 'mid flowers And songs the easy way Of pleasure day by day, Ask what thou wilt of all thy lived-out hours.â And then she thought: âOh, shall it be when there, A blameless maiden, I, Dreaming, watched love draw nigh, And felt his kiss rose-sweet on mouth and hair? âOr shall it be when, that white night, his fingers Smoothed from my brow the curls, And fell, like unstrung pearls, His words of passionate love whose memory lingers? âOr shall it be when over earth and sea I heard the sweet unrest Within his ardent breast, His heart that beat alone for me, for me? âOr shall it be when, in his belting arms, Soul gazed on kindred soul, And love had won the goal Of his desire, and his were all my charms? âNo! no! not these! that hour he left me lost! Stunned, fallen and despised Before the world he prized, WhenâGod forgive me!âwhen I loved him most!â EPILOGUE Beyond the moon, within a land of mist, Lies the dim Garden of all Dead Desires, Walled round with morning's clouded amethyst, And haunted of the sunset's shadowy fires; There all lost things we loved hold ghostly trystâ Dead dreams, dead hopes, dead loves, and dead desires. Sad are the stars that day and night exist Above the Garden of all Dead Desires; And sad the roses that within it twist Deep bow'rs; and sad the wind that through it quires; But sadder far are they who there hold trystâ Dead dreams, dead hopes, dead loves, and dead desires. There, like a dove upon the twilight's wrist,â Soft in the Garden of all Dead Desires,â Sleep broods; and there, where never a serpent hissed, On the wan willows music hangs her lyres, Ãolian dials by which phantoms trystâ Dead dreams, dead hopes, dead loves, and dead desires. There you shall hear low voices; kisses kissed, Faint in the Garden of all Dead Desires, By lips the anguish of vain song makes whist; And meet with shapes that art's despair attires; And gaze in eyes where all sweet sorrows trystâ Dead dreams, dead hopes, dead loves, and dead desires. Thither we go, dreamer and realist, Bound for the Garden of all Dead Desires, Where we shall find, perhaps, all Life hath missed, All Life hath longed for when the soul aspires; All Earth's elusive loveliness at trystâ Dead dreams, dead hopes, dead loves, and dead desires. [POEMS OF MYTH AND ROMANCE] PROEM There is no rhyme that is half so sweet As the song of the wind in the rippling wheat; There is no metre that's half so fine As the lilt of the brook under rock and vine; And the loveliest lyric I ever heard Was the wildwood strain of a forest bird.â If the wind and the brook and the bird would teach My heart their beautiful parts of speech, And the natural art that they say these with, My soul would sing of beauty and myth In a rhyme and a metre that none before Have sung in their love, or dreamed in their lore, And the world would be richer one poet the more. MYTH AND ROMANCE I When I go forth to greet the glad-faced Spring, Just at the time of opening apple-buds, When brooks are laughing, winds are whispering, On babbling hillsides, or in warbling woods, There is an unseen presence that eludes:â Perhaps a Dryad, in whose tresses cling The loamy odors of old solitudes, Who from her beechen doorway calls, and leads My soul to follow; now with dimpling words Of leaves; and now with syllables of birds; While here and thereâis it her limbs that swing? Or restless sunlight on the moss and weeds? II Or, haply 'tis a Naiad now who slips, Like some white lily, from her fountain's glass, While from her dripping hair and breasts and hips The moisture rains cool music on the grass. Her have I heard and followed, yet, alas! Have seen no more than the wet ray that dips The shivered waters, wrinkling where I pass; But in the liquid light, where she doth hide, I have beheld the azure of her gaze Smiling; and, where the orbing ripple plays, Among her minnows I have heard her lips, Bubbling, make merry by the waterside. III Or now it is an Oreadâwhose eyes Are constellated duskâwho stands confessed, As naked as a flow'r; her heart's surprise, Like morning's rose, mantling her brow and breast: She, shrinking from my presence, all distressed Stands for a startled moment ere she flies, Her deep hair blowing, up the mountain crest, Wild as a mist that trails along the dawn. And is't her footfalls lure me? or the sound Of airs that stir the crisp leaf on the ground? And is't her body glimmers on yon rise? Or dogwood blossoms snowing on the lawn? IV Now 'tis a Satyr piping serenades On a slim reed. Now Pan and Faun advance Beneath green-hollowed roofs of forest glades, Their feet gone mad with music: now, perchance, Sylvanus sleeping, on whose leafy trance The Nymphs stand gazing in dim ambuscades Of sun-embodied perfume.âMyth, Romance, Where'er I turn, reach out bewildering arms, Compelling me to follow. Day and night I hear their voices and behold the light Of their divinity that still evades, And still allures me in a thousand forms. REVERIE What ogive gates from gold of Ophir wrought, What walls of Parian, whiter than a rose, What towers of crystal, for the eyes of thought, Hast builded on dim Islands of Repose? Thy cloudy columns, vast, Corinthian, Or huge, Ionic, colonnade the heights Of Dreamland, looming o'er the soul's deep seas; Piled melodies of marble, that no man Has ever reached, except in fancy's flights, Templing the presence of perpetual ease. Oft, where o'er plastic frieze and plinths of spar,â In glimmering solitudes of pillared stone,â The twilight blossoms with one violet star, With thee, O Reverie, I have stood alone, And there beheld, from out the Mythic Age, The rosy breasts of Cythereaâfair, Full-cestused, and suggestive of what loves Immortal!ârise; and heard the lyric rage Of sunburnt Poesy, whose throat breathes bare O'er leopard skins, fluting among his groves. Oft, where thy castled peaks and templed vales Cloudâlike convulsive sunsetsâshores that dream, Myrrh-fragrant, over siren seas whose sails Gleam white as lilies on a lilied stream, My soul has stood. Or by thy sapphire sea, In thy arcaded gardens, in the shade Of breathing sculpture, oft has walked with thought, And bent, in shadowy attitude, its knee Before the shrine of Beauty that must fade And leave no memory of the mind that wrought. Who hath beheld thy caverns where, in heaps, The wine of Lethe and Love's witchery, In sealÃ©d amphorÃ¦ a sibyl keeps? World-old, a grape filled with the soul of thee. No wine of Xeres or of Syracuse! No fine Falernian and no vile Sabine! The stolen fire of a demigod, Whose bubbled purple heavenly feet did bruise In crusted vats of vintage, when the green Flamed into autumn, on the Samian sod. Oh, for the deep enchantment of one draught! The reckless ecstasy of classic earth!â To make me godlike as the gods that laughed In eyes of mortal brown, a mighty mirth Of deity delirious with desire! To make me one with roses of the shrines, The splashing wine-libation or the blood, And all the young priest's dreaming! To inspire My very soul with beauty till it shines Star-like amid life's starry brotherhood! Would I might slumber in the old-world shades, Where poesy could touch me, as some bold Wild-bee a pulpy lily of the glades, Barbaric-covered with the kerneled gold; And feel the glory of the Golden Age Less godly than my purpose, strong to dare Death with the young immortal lips of Love: Less lovely than my soul's ideal rage To mate itself with Music and declare Itself part meaning of the stars above. LETHE I There is a scent of roses and spilt wine Between the moonlight and the laurel-coppice; The marble idol glimmers on its shrine, White as a star, among a heaven of poppies. Here all my life lies like a spilth of wine. There is a mouth of music like a lute, A nightingale that singeth to one flower; Between the falling flower and the fruit, Where love hath died, the music of an hour. II To sit alone with memory and a rose; To dwell with shadows of whilom romances; To make one hour of a year of woes And walk on starlight, in ethereal trances, With love's lost face fair as a moon-white rose. To shape from music and the scent of buds Love's spirit and its presence of sweet fire, Between the heart's wild burning and the blood's, Is part of life and of the soul's desire. III There is a song to silence and the stars, Between the forest and the temple's arches; And down the stream of night, like nenuphars, The tossing fires of the MÃ¦nads' torches.â Here all my life waits lonely as the stars.â Shall not one hour of all those hours suffice For resignation God hath given as dower? Between the summons and the sacrifice One hour of love, th' eternity of an hour? IV The shrine is shattered and the bird is gone; Dark is the house of music and of bridal: The stars are stricken and the storm comes on; Beneath a wreck of roses lies the idol, Sad as the memory of a joy that's gone.â To dream of perished gladness and a kiss, Waking the last chord of Love's broken lyre, Between remembering and forgetting, this Is part of life and of the soul's desire. THE NAIAD She sits among the iris stalks Of bubbling brooks; and leans for hours Among the river's lily-flowers, Or on their whiteness walks: Above dark forest pools, gray rocks Wall in, she leans with dripping locks, And listening to the echo, talks With her own faceâIothera. There is no forest of the hills, No valley of the solitude, Nor fern nor moss, that may elude Her searching step that stills: She dreams among the wild-rose brakes Of fountains that the ripple shakes, And, dreaming of herself, she fills The silence with âIothera.â And every wind that haunts the ways Of leaf and bough, once having kissed Her virgin nudity, goes whist With wonder and amaze. There blows no breeze which hath not learned Her name's sweet melody, and yearned To kiss her mouth that laughs and says, âIothera, Iothera.â No wild thing of the wood, no bird, Or brown or blue, or gold or gray, Beneath the sun's or moon's pale ray, That hath not loved and heard; They are her pupils; she can say No new thing but, within a day, They have its music, word for word, Harmonious as Iothera. No man who lives and is not wise With love for common flowers and trees, Bee, bird, and beast, and brook, and breeze, And rocks, and hills, and skies,â Search where he will,âshall ever see One flutter of her drapery, One glimpse of limbs, or hair, or eyes Of beautiful Iothera. THE LIMNAD I The lake she haunts gleams mistily Through sleepy boughs of melody,â Lost 'mid lone hills beside the sea, In tangled bush and brier:â Where reflected sunsets write Ghostly things in golden light; Where, along the pine-crowned height, Clouds of twilight, rosy white, Build far towers of fire. II 'Mid the rushes there that swing, Flowering flags where voices sing When night-winds are murmuring, And the stars of midnight glitter; Blossom-white, with purple locks, Underneath the stars' still flocks, In the dusky waves she rocks, Rocks, and all the landscape mocks With a song both sweet and bitter. III Soft it sounds, at first, as dreams Filled with tears that fall in streams; Then it soars, until it seems Beauty's very self hath spoken; And the woods grow silent quite, Stars wax faint and flowers wane white; And the nightingales that light Near, or hear her through the night, Die, their hearts with longing broken. IV Dark, dim, and sad o'er mournful lands, White-throated stars heaped in her hands, Like wildwood buds, the Twilight stands, The Twilight, dreaming, lingers; Listening where the Limnad sings Witcheries, whose magic brings A great moon from hidden springs, Pale with amorous quiverings Feet of fire and silvery fingers. V In the vales Auloniads, On the mountains Oreads, On the leas Leimoniads, Whiter than the stars that glisten, Pan, the Satyrs, Dryades, Fountain-lovely Naiades, Foam-lipped Oceanides, Breathless 'mid their seas and trees, Stay and look and lean and listen. VI Large-eyed, Siren-like she stands, In the lake or on its sands, And with rapture from the hands Of the Night some stars are shaken; To her song the rushes swing, Lilies nod and ripples ring, Lost in helpless listeningâ These will wake who hear her sing, But one mortal will not waken. BEFORE THE TEMPLE I All desolate she sate her down Upon the marble of the temple's stair. You would have thought her, with her eyes of brown, Flushed cheeks and hazel hair, A Dryad dreaming there. II A priest of Bacchus passed, nor stopped To chide her; deeming herâwhose chiton hid But half her bosom, and whose girdle droppedâ Some grief-drowned Bassarid, The god of wine had chid. III With wreaths of woodland cyclamen For Dian's shrine, a shepherdess drew near, All her young thoughts on vestal beauty, whenâ She dare not look for fearâ Behold the goddess here! IV Fierce lights on shields of bossy brass And helms of bronze, next from the hills deploy Tall youths of Argos. And she sees him pass, Flushed with heroic joy, On towards the siege of Troy. THE RUE-ANEMONE Under an oak-tree in a woodland, where The dreaming Spring had dropped it from her hair, I found a flower, through which I seemed to gaze Beyond the world and see what no man dare Behold and liveâthe myths of bygone daysâ Diana and Endymion; and the bare, Slim beauty of the boy whom Echo wooed; And Hyacinthus, whom Apollo dewed With love and death; and Daphne, ever fair; And that reed-slender girl whom Pan pursued. I stood and gazed and through it seemed to see The Dryad dancing by the forest tree, Her hair wild blown: the Faun, with listening ear, Deep in the boscage, kneeling on one knee, Watching the wandered Oread draw near, Her wild heart beating like a honey-bee Within a rose.âAll, all the myths of old, All, all the bright shapes of the Age of Gold, Peopling the wonder-worlds of Poetry, Through it I seemed in fancy to behold. What other flower, that, fashioned like a star, Draws its frail life from earth and braves the war Of all the heavens, can suggest the dreams That this suggests? in which no trace of mar Or soil exists: where stainless innocence seems Enshrined; and where, beyond our vision far, That inaccessible beauty, which the heart Worships as truth and holiness and art, Is symbolized; wherein embodied are The things that make the soul's immortal part. ARTEMIS Oft of the hiding Oread wast thou seen At earliest morn, a tall, imperial shape, High-buskined, dew-dripped, and on close, young curls, Bright blackness of thick hair, the tipsy drops Caught from the dripping sprays of underbosks,â Kissed of thy cheek and of thy shoulder brushed,â Thy rosy cheek as far Aurora's fair, Thy snowy shoulder Hebe-beautiful. Oft did the shaggy hills and solitudes Of Arethusa shout and ring and reel, Reverberate and echo merrily, Leap into sound with singing of thy hounds, With the deep belling of thy noble hounds, Big-mouthed and musical, that on the stag Or bristling wild-boar furious grew in quest: And thou, as keen, fleet-footed and clean-limbed, Inviolable, with thy quivered crew, Rushed, swinging on the wind free limbs and lithe, And locks, all radiance, flung back to blow And balm with spice the wine-sharp air of morn. Ai me! their throats! their clarion-crystal throats, That made the hills sing and the wood-ways dance, As if to orphic strains, and gave them life. Ai me! their bosoms' deepness and the firm, Pure, happy beauty of their naked limbs, That stormed the forest vacancies with light, Swift daylight of their splendor, and made blow, Within the glad sonorous solitudes, Old germs of flowerets a century cold. The woodland Naiad whispered by her rock; The Hamadryad, limpid-eyed and wild, Expectant rustled by her usual oak And laughed in wonder; and mad Pan himself Reeled piping fiercely down the dingled deeps, With rollicking eye that rolled a brutish joy. And did some unwed maiden, musing where Her father's well, among the god-graced hills; Bubbled and babbled, hear thy bugled cry, O Huntress, she, while deep her dripping jar Unheeded brimmed, vowed her virginity To theeâher shorn hair at thy vestal feet. But, ah! not when the garish daylight fills The forests with far-swimming gold and green Let me behold thee, goddess! but when dim The slow night settles on the haunted wood And walks in mystery; and the myriad stars Maze heaven with fire; and the echoy waste, Far off, far off, in murmurs palpitates Unto the Limnad's voice, unmerciful,â Or is't some night-bird breaking with song its heart?â Unmerciful and sad and bitter-sweet?â Then come in all thy godhead, beautiful! All beautiful and gentle, as thou cam'st To lorn Endymion, who, in Lemnos once, Lone in the wizard magic of the wood, Wandered, a dreaming boy, unfriended, sad.â It grew far off among the easy trees, Thy pensive beauty, blossoming flower-like Between the tree-trunks and the lacing limbs; Bright in the leaves that kissed for very joy And drunkenness of glory thus revealed. He saw it all, from glorious face to feetâ The naked pearl of all thy loveliness, Thy body's beauty, blended lily and rose, Alone, uncompanied of handmaidens. Like some rare, radiant fruit Hesperian, Not to be plucked of gods or men, thou hung'st Upon the boughs of heaven. Thy moonÃ©d voice Came silvering on his wistful ear, and sighed With light like leaves that kiss and cling again. And on such perilous beauty that must slay,â The poisonous favor of thy godliness,â Feasting his every sense through eyes and ears, His soul exalted waxed and amorous,â Like some young god who, draining Olympian bowls, Grows drunk with nectar,âwith immortal love; And what remained, ah, what remained but death! APHRODITE Apollo never smote as lovely a strain, When swan-necked Hebe stayed her nectared bowl Among the circled and reclining gods, To lend a listening ear and smile on him, As that the Tritons blew on wreathÃ©d horns When Aphrodite, the cold ocean-foam, In lovely labor, from its singing snow Upheaved her dazzling form, like some white pearl, Naked and fresh within its ocean shell, Borne shoreward from its bed of golden sponge And crimson coral by the mad monsoon. Wind-rocked she swung, her white feet on the sea; And music raved down the slant western winds: With swollen jowls the Tritons puffed their conchs, Where, breasting with white bosoms the green waves, That laughed in ripples at Love's misty feet, Oceanids with dimple-dented palms Smote sidewise the pale bubbles of the foam, Weaving a silver rainbow round her form. Around her dolphins sparkled in the spray, And Nereids sang, braiding their streaming locks, Or flung them backward shimm'ring with bells of foam, Till evening lit her loneliest, loveliest star,â That passion-flower of the fields of heaven,â Pale mirrored in the sheen of shadowy seas,â That, like arrested music, o'er the caves The Sirens haunt, hung deep on silent deep,â When, in a hollow pearl, down moonwhite waves, The creatures of the ocean danced their queen Unto an island, like a rosy mist That glimmering dreamed upon the glimmering blue. There on the silvery sands beside the sea, Beneath the moon,ânarcissus-white,âthey met, She naked as a star and crowned with stars, Child of the airy foam and Queen of Love. PERSEPHONE O Hades! O false gods! false to yourselves! O Hades, 'twas thy brother gave her thee Without a mother's sanction or her knowledge! Thou bor'st her to the dreadful gulfs below, And made her queen, a shadowy queen of shades, Queen of the fiery flood and iron realms, Eternal torture and eternal pain. On blossomed plains in Far Trinacria A maiden,âthe dark cascade of whose hair Was deep as midnight circled and crowned with stars,â Hair dark as rays that brighten with the moon,â Went gathering flowers with the Oceanids, Lily and rose and pale Narcissus,âwho Was Echo's passion once, a flower now That stares forever in the lake's still glass, Whose ripple breaks its image, flickering seen,â As once with tears it broke beneath his eyes,â With the fast-falling dew that fills its heart: When suddenly there rose with iron wain, With iron wain and steeds, a shape like death, 'Mid sallow smoke and sulphur and pale fires, Its countenance ghastly, and its hair and eyes Like the blue flame of sulphur: in its arms, Its sooty arms, where like to supple steel The mighty muscles lay, unto its breast, Such as its arms, it drew her fragile form As bosomed bulks of tempest in their joy With arms of winds drag to their black embrace A fairy mist that flecks with white the summer, With wings of shadeless white, and 'tis no more Heaved on the rapture of the thunder's heart. The snowy flowers shuddered and grew still; With withered heads they bowed, and on the streamâ Where all the day it was their wont to stand In silence gazing at their loveliness.â Laid their fair faces limp and shriveled white. Flames whipped the air like fiery scorpions, Blasting and burning all the fragrant myths That haunt the dew and lair in bloom and breeze. O foam-fair daughters of Oceanus! In vain you seek your mate and chide the flowers For hiding her beneath their palms of snow: Ask of that shell, that conch of twisted pearl, Which, like a spirit of the singing sea, Moans at your pallid feet made wet with spray: Then, sitting by the tumbling blue of waves, Mourn to the waters and the ribbÃ©d sands, The falseness of the god who grasps the storm. DEMETER Eternal pouring in her lonely path The wells of sorrow lay. I see her now,â Methinks I see her now,âan awful shape Guiding her dragon-team in frenzied search From Argive lands unto the jeweled shores Of the remotest Ind where Usha's hand Soothed her grief-shadowed brow with kindly touch, And Savitar breathed sympathy from the skies O'er uttermost regions of the faneless Brahm. In melancholy search I see her roam The Himalayas,âworld-dividing,âpale 'Mid ice and snow, through mists and night and storm; Then back again with that wild mother woe Fueling the anguished fire of her eyes,â Back where old Atlas groans beneath the world, And the Cimmerian twilight weighs the soul. Deep was her sleep in Persia's haunted vales, Where many a languid Philomela moaned Her heart to rest with heartbreak melody. I see her near Ionia's swelling seas Cull from the sands a labyrinthine shell, Hollowing its spiral murmur to her ear,â A pearly mouth against an ear of pearl,â In hope some message of Persephone It might impart; then finding all in vain, In anguish and despair, cast it afar, To watch the salt-spray flash, like some soft plume Dropped from the wings of Eros, where it fell. I see her take a flute of coral from A listening Triton; and on Ithakan rocks High seated at the starry close of day,â When sad the moon rose from her salty couch, Gazing with sorrow on her face of sorrow,â Pipe pensive airs,âplaintive as Sirens sing In streaming caves beneath the ocean wall,â Till hoar Poseidon cleared his wrinkled front And stilled his surgy clamors to a sigh. This do I see, and more: Behold, with fear! I see her 'mid the lonely groves of Crete, Frighten the dun deer from th' o'ervaulted green Of thickest boscage, searching every covert With terror of her torches and her wail, âPersephone! Persephone!â till the pines Of mist-swathed Dicte shuddered through their miles, The panther roared down in the stream-mad gorge, And Echo shrieked from chasm to answering chasm, âPersephone!â bewildered with her woe: As wild as when she echoed the despair, Dishevel-haired, of maidens, wailing borne,â Athenian tribute,âto that King of Crete, Great Minos, when the Minotaur they saw Grim, crouching in his labyrinth of stone. DIONYSOS âIo! Bacchus! Bacchus! Io! Io! O Dionysos! Dionysos! ivy-crowned! O let me sing thy triumph ere I die!â I slept; and dreamed a MÃ¦nad came to me: A harp of hollow agate strung with gold Wailed 'neath her waxen fingers, and her heart Under its gauze, through which the moonlight shone, Kept time with its wild throbbings to her song. âÃgeus sleeps, O Dionysos! sleeps Beneath the restless waves that sigh his name Eternally at my dew-glistening feet. Here 'twas he died, O Dionysos! here The great king died for whom is named this sea.â O let me sing thy triumph ere I die! âWith the shrill syrinx and the kissing clang Of silver cymbals, and the sound of flutes, O pard-drawn youth, thou dist awake the world To joy and pleasure with thy sunny wine! Mad'st India bow and the dun, flooding Nile Grow purple with the murex of the wine Cast from the fullness of Silenus' cup, While yet the heavens of heat saw sarabands Whirl 'mid the redness of the Libyan sands, That drank the spilth of Bacchus, sparkling-spun From the Bacchante bowl, a beaded red O'er the slant edge, that twinkled in the sun, The tiger sun fierce-glaring overhead. âWhat made gold Horus smile with golden lips? Anubis dire forget his ghosts to lead To Hell's profoundness?âHe, who stayed to sip One winking bubble from the wine-god's cup, And, captive ever after, joined thy train?â What made Osiris, 'mid the palms of Nile, Leave Isis dreaming, and the frolic Pan's Wild trebles follow as a roaring bull, Far as the fanes of Indra; he who long Was mourned in Memphis by his tawny priests?â Io Bacchus! Bacchus! Io! Io! The brimming purple of thy hollow gold They tasted and, 'though gods, they worship'd too! âSad Echo sat once in a spiral cave; She, from its sea-dyed labyrinth of rock, Saw the long pageant dancing on the strand, Where Nereus slept upon an isle of crags, And o'er the slope of his far-foaming head The strangeness of the orgies wildly cried, Till the gray god awoke, at first in rage; Serened his face then; stretched a welcoming hand With civil utterance for the Bacchus horn. But Echo followed not; instead, she sits Among her crags remembering that wild cry, That nomad sound still haunting all her dreams, Confusing all her speech, that naught can say Save warring words bewildering her ears Like waves reverberant in a deep sea-cave. âIo! Bacchus! Bacchus! Io! Io! See, the white stars, O Dionysos! see, Have spilled their glittering globules, one by one,â Like bubbles winking in the cup of night,â Down the dark west behind the mountain chain. Ãgeus sleeps, lulled by my murmuring harp; And I have sung thy triumph. Let me die!â THE PAPHIAN VENUS With anxious eyes and dry, expectant lips, Within the sculptured stoa by the sea, All day she waited while, like ghostly ships, Long clouds rolled over Paphos: the wild bee Hung in the sultry poppy, half asleep, Beside the shepherd and his drowsy sheep. White-robed she waited day by day; alone With the white temple's shrined concupiscence, The Paphian goddess on her obscene throne, Binding all chastity to violence, All innocent to lust that feels no shameâ Venus Mylitta born of filth and flame. So must they haunt her marble portico, The devotees of passion, passion-pale As moonlight streaming through the stormy snow; Dark eyes desirous of the stranger sail,â The gods shall bring across the Cyprian Sea, And him elected to their mastery. A priestess of the temple came, when eve Blazed, like a satrap's triumph, in the west; And watched her listening to the ocean's heave, Dusk's golden glory on her face and breast, And in her hair the rosy wind's caress,â Pitying her dedicated tenderness. When out of darkness night persuades the stars, A dream shall bend above her saying, âSoon A barque shall come with purple sails and spars, Sailing from Tarsus 'neath a low white moon; And thou shalt see one in a robe of Tyre Facing toward thee like the god Desire. âRise then! as, clad in starlight, riseth nightâ Thy nakedness clad on with loveliness! So shalt thou see him, like the god Delight, Breast through the foam and climb the cliff to press Hot lips to thine and lead thee in before Love's awful presence where ye shall adore.â Thus at her heart the vision entered in, With lips of lust the lips of song had kissed, And eyes of passion laughing with sweet sin, A starry splendor robed in amethyst, Seen like that star set in the glittering gloamâ Venus Mylitta born of fire and foam. So shall she dream until, near middle night,â When on the blackness of the ocean's rim The moon, like some war-galleon all alight With blazing battle, from the sea shall swim,â A shadow, with inviolate lips and eyes, Shall rise before her speaking in this wise: âSo hast thou heard the promises of one,â Of her, with whom the God of gods is wroth,â For whom was prophesied at Babylon The second deathâChaldÃ¦an Mylidoth! Whose feet take hold on darkness and despair, Hissing destruction in her heart and hair! âWouldst thou behold the vessel she would bring?â A wreck! ten hundred years have smeared with slime: A hulk! where all abominations cling, The spawn and vermin of the seas of time: Wild waves have rotted it, fierce suns have scorched, Mad winds have tossed and stormy stars have torched. âCan lust give birth to love! The vile and foul Be mother to beauty? Lo! can this thing be?â A monster like a man shall rise and howl Upon the wreck across the crawling sea, Then plunge; and swim unto thee; like an ape, A beast all belly.âThou canst not escape!â Gone was the shadow with the suffering brow; And in the temple's porch she lay and wept, Alone with night, the ocean, and her vow. Then up the east the moon's full splendor swept, And, dark between itâwreck or argosy?â A sudden vessel far away at sea. GARGAPHIE âSuccinctÃ¦ sacra DianÃ¦.ââ Ovid. I There the ragged sunlight lay Tawny on thick ferns and gray On dark waters: dimmer, Lone and deep, the cypress grove Bowered mystery and wove Braided lights, like those that love On the pearl plumes of a dove Faint to gleam and glimmer. II There centennial pine and oak Into stormy utterance broke: Hollow rocks gloomed, slanting, Echoing in dim arcade, Looming with long moss, that made Twilight streaks in tatters laid: Where the wild hart, hunt-affrayed, Plunged the water, panting. III Poppies of a sleepy gold Mooned the gray-green darkness rolled Down its vistas, making Wisp-like blurs of flame. And pale Stole the dim deer down the vale: And the haunting nightingale Sang unseenâthe olden tale All its hurt heart breaking. IV There the hazy serpolet, Dewy cistus, blooming wet, Blushed on bank and boulder: There the cyclamen, as wan As faint footsteps of the Dawn, Carpeted the spotted lawn: Where the nude nymph, dripping drawn, Sloped a flower-white shoulder. V In the citrine shadow there What tall presences and fair, Godlike, lingered!âgracious As the rock-rose there that grew:â Delicate and dim as dew Stepped from out the oaks, and drew Faun-like forms to follow, who Filled the forest spacious! VI Guarded that BÅotian Valley so no foot of man Soiled its silence holy With profaning treadâsave one, The Hyantian: ActÃ¦on, Who beheld but was undone By Diana's wrath, that none,â 'Though with magic moly,â VII Might escape.âThat valley sleeps Lost to us: enchantment keeps Sacred still its banished Bowers that no man may see, Fountains that her deity Haunts, and every rock and tree Where her hunt goes swinging free As in ages vanished. THE FAUN The joys that touched thee once, be mine! The sympathies of sky and sea, The friendship of each rock and pine, That made thy lonely life, ah me! In Tempe or in Gargaphie. Such joy as thou didst feel when first, On some wild crag, thou stood'st alone And watched the mountain tempest burst, With streaming thunder, lightning sown, On Latmos or on Pelion. Thy awe! when crowned with vastness, Night And Silence ruled the deep's abyss; And through dark leaves thou saw'st the white Breasts of the starry maids who kiss Pale feet of moony Artemis. Thy dreams! when, breasting matted weeds Of Arethusa, thou didst hear The music of the wind-swept reeds; And down dim forest-ways drew near Shy herds of slim Arcadian deer. Thy wisdom! that knew naught but love And beauty, with which love is fraught; The wisdom of the heartâwhereof All noblest passions springâthat thought As Nature thinks, âAll else is naught.â Thy hope! wherein To-morrow set No shadow; hope that, lacking care And retrospect, held no regret, But bloomed in rainbows everywhere Filling with gladness all the air. These were thine all: in all life's moods Embracing all of happiness: And when within thy long-loved woods Didst lay thee down to die, no less Thy happiness stood by to bless. APOLLO I All the Lydian notes revealing, Son of Leto, oh, come stealing As the wind Thessalian rivers Whisper of! the wind that shivers Every ripple into stars, In the sunlight's golden bars. Touch thy harp, that haunts the oaks, With the mastery that invokes Naiad music of the fount, Oread music of the mount; And such satyr song as keeps Revel on LycÃ¦an steeps, When night nods, a MÃ¦nad shape, Purple with dusk's staining grape. Wake such chords as dewy grounds Echo when no mortal hounds Bell the hunt, whose spear-point shines Through Arcadia's tangled vines, When the half-awakened Dawn, Dreaming on a mountain lawn, Lets her golden sandals lie And walks barefooted through the sky; And by Arethusa's bank, Swift upon the red hart's flank, Drives Diana's buskined band Down the cistus-blossomed strand. Then Love's minors, swooning o'er The mountain hush, the ocean roar, As Selene, stealing, sails Over Lemnos' lakes to vales Where Endymion dreams and feels Love her stolen kiss reveals. II Thou hast sung of Helicon: How the sister Muses won From the nine Pierides Empire o'er the harmonies. Thou hast sung of Tempe's maid, And the sudden laurel's aid. Thou hast sung of many loves Of the gods that haunt the groves Where the marble altar stands Rose-heaped by the balmy hands Of Romance and Beauty; where, High upon the temple stair, Priest-like, bay-crowned, white of hair, Old Tradition, looking up, Pours libation from his cup. Thou hast sung, all sweet of tongue, As once wild Amphion sung, Songs,âParnassian rocks,âthat swung Each in its lyric niche, and massed Such mural heights of song and vast, Melodious walls of poesy, That Time himself shall not outlast, Enduring as eternity. III Ours shall be no island song, Suited to a maiden throng, Dancing with their wreaths of roses To the double-flute's soft closes!â But a Nation's! whose large eyes With life's liberty are wise, And consenting sympathies Of all arts and sciences. She! who stands above the storms With truth's thunder in her arms, And the star-serenity Of her hope bound burningly Round her brow; and at her knee The Spirit of Progress who is shod With ethereal fire of God. . . . Yea! thy last shall still be firstâ Some wild epopee to burst With such organ notes as rang When the stars of morning sang, And the Sons of Heaven sent Shoutings through the firmament; As our years have justified And the stars have prophesied. 1886. JOTUNHEIM I Beyond the Northern Lights, in regions haunted Of twilight, where the world is glacier planted, And pale as LokÃ© in his cavern when The serpent's slaver burns him to the bones, I saw the phantasms of gigantic men, The prototypes of vastness, quarrying stones; Great blocks of winter, glittering with the morn's And evening's colors,âwild prismatic tones Of boreal beauty.âLike the three gray Norns, Silence and solitude and terror loomed Around them where they labored. Walls arose, Vast as the Andes when creation boomed Insurgent fire; and through the rushing snows Enormous battlements of tremendous ice, Bastioned and turreted, I saw arise. II But who can sing the workmanship gigantic That reared within its coruscating dome The roaring fountain, hurling an Atlantic Of liquid ice that flashed with flame and foam? An opal spirit, various and many formed,â In whose clear heart reverberant fire stormed,â Seemed its inhabitant; and through pale halls, And deep diaphanous walls, And corridors of whiteness, Auroral colors swarmed, As rosy-flickering stains, Or lambent green, or gold, or crimson, warmed The pulsing crystal of the spirit's veins With ever-changing brightness. And through the Arctic night there went a voice, As if the ancient Earth cried out, âRejoice!â My heart is full of lightness!â III Here well might Thor, the god of war, Harness the whirlwinds to his car, While, mailed in storm, his iron arm Heaves high his hammer's lava-form, And red and black his beard streams back, Like some fierce torrent scoriac, Whose earthquake light glares through the night Around some dark volcanic height; And through the skies Valkyrian cries Trumpet, as battleward he flies, Death in his hair and havoc in his eyes. IV Still in my dreams I hear that fountain flowing; Beyond all seeing and beyond all knowing; Still in my dreams I see those wild walls glowing With hues, Aurora-kissed; And through huge halls fantastic phantoms going, Vast shapes of snow and mist,â Sonorous clarions of the tempest blowing,â That trail dark banners by, Cloudlike, underneath the sky Of the caverned dome on high, Carbuncle and amethyst.â Still I hear the ululation Of their stormy exultation, Multitudinous, and blending In hoarse echoes, far, unending; And, through halls of fog and frost, Howling back, like madness lost In the moonless mansion of Death and demon-haunted love. V Still in my dreams I hear the mermaid singing; The mermaid music at its portal ringing; The mermaid song, that hinged with gold its door, And, whispering evermore, Hushed the ponderous hurl and roar And vast Ã¦olian thunder Of the chained tempests under The frozen cataracts that were its floor.â And, blinding beautiful, I still behold The mermaid there, combing her locks of gold, While at her feet, green as the Northern Seas, Gambol her flocks of seals and walruses; While, like a drift, her dog,âa Polar bear,â Lies by her, glowering through his shaggy hair. VI O wondrous house, built by supernal hands In vague and ultimate lands! Thy architects were behemoth wind and cloud, That, laboring loud, Mountained thy world foundations and uplifted Thy skyey bastions drifted Of piled eternities of ice and snow; Where storms, like ploughmen, go, Ploughing the deeps with awful hurricane; Where, spouting icy rain, The huge whale wallows; and through furious hail Th' explorer's tattered sail Drives like the wing of some terrific bird, Where wreck and famine herd.â VII Home of the red Auroras and the gods! He who profanes thy perilous threshold,âwhere The ancient centuries lair, And, glacier-throned, thy monarch, Winter, nods,â Let him beware! Lest coming on that hoary presence there, Whose pitiless hand, Above that hungry land, An iceberg wields as sceptre, and whose crown The North Star is, set in a band of frost, He, too, shall feel the bitterness of that frown, And, turned to stone, forevermore be lost. DIONYSIA The day is dead; and in the west The slender crescent of the moonâ Diana's crystal-kindled crestâ Sinks hillward in a silvery swoon. What is the murmur in the dell? The stealthy whisper and the drip? A Dryad with her leaf-light trip? A Naiad o'er her fountain well?â Who, with white fingers for her comb, Sleeks her blue hair, and from its curls Showers slim minnows and pale pearls, And hollow music of the foam. What is it in the vistaed ways That leans and springs, and stoops and sways?â The naked limbs of one who flees? An Oread who hesitates Before the Satyr form that waits, Crouching to leap, that there she sees? Or under boughs, reclining cool, A Hamadryad, like a pool Of moonlight, palely beautiful? Or Limnad, with her lilied face, More lovely than the misty lace That haunts a star in a firefly place? Or is it some Leimoniad In wildwood flowers dimly clad? Oblong blossoms white as froth, Or mottled like the tiger-moth; Or brindled as the brows of death, Wild of hue and wild of breath: Here ethereal flame and milk Blent with velvet and with silk; Here an iridescent glow Mixed with satin and with snow: Pansy, poppy and the pale Serpolet and galingale; Mandrake and anemone, Honey-reservoirs o' the bee; Cistus and the cyclamen,â Cheeked like blushing Hebe this, And the other white as is Bubbled milk of Venus when Cupid's baby mouth is pressed, Rosy, to her rosy breast. And, besides, all flowers that mate With aroma, and in hue Stars and rainbows duplicate Here on earth for me and you. Yea! at last mine eyes can see! 'Tis no shadow of the tree Swaying softly there, but she!â MÃ¦nad, Bassarid, Bacchant, What you will, who doth enchant Night with sensuous nudity. Lo! again I hear her pant Breasting through the dewy gloomsâ Through the glow-worm gleams and glowers Of the starlight; wood-perfumes Swoon around her and frail showers Of the leaflet-tilted rain. Lo! like love, she comes again Through the pale voluptuous dusk, Sweet of limb with breasts of musk. With her lips, like blossoms, breathing Honeyed pungence of her kiss, And her auburn tresses wreathing Like umbrageous helichrys, There she stands, like flame and snow, In the moon's ambrosial glow, Both her shapely loins low-looped With the balmy blossoms, drooped, Of the deep amaracus. Spiritual, yet sensual, Lo, she ever greets me thus In my vision; white and tall, Her delicious body there,â Raimented with amorous air,â To my mind expresses all The allurements of the world. And once more I seem to feel On my soul, like frenzy, hurled All the passionate past.âI reel, Greek again in ancient Greece, In the Pyrrhic revelries; In the mad and MÃ¦nad dance; Onward dragged with violence: Pan and old Silenus and Faunus and a Bacchant band Round me. Wild my wine-stained hand O'er tumultuous hair is lifted; While the flushed and Phallic orgies Whirl around me; and the marges Of the wood are torn and rifted With lascivious laugh and shout. And barbarian there again,â Shameless with the shameless rout, Bacchus lusting in each vein,â With her pagan lips on mine, Like a god made drunk with wine, On I reel; and in the revels Her loose hair, the dance dishevels, Blows, and 'thwart my vision swims All the splendor of her limbs. . . . So it seems. Yet woods are lonely. And when I again awake, I shall find their faces only Moonbeams in the boughs that shake; And their revelsâbut the rush Of night-winds through bough and brush. But my dreaming?âis it more Than mere dreaming? Is a door Opened in my soul? a curtain Raised? to let me see for certain I have lived that life before? VINE AND SYCAMORE I Here where a tree and its wild liana, Leaning over the streamlet, grow, Once a nymph, like the moon'd Diana, Sat in the ages long ago, Sat with a mortal with whom she had mated, Sat and smiled with a mortal youth, Ere he of the forest, the god who hated, Changed the two into forms uncouth. . . . II Once in the woods she had heard a shepherd, Heard a reed in a golden glade; Followed, and clad in the skin of a leopard, Found him fluting within the shade. Found him sitting with bare brown shoulder, Lithe and young as a sapling oak, And leaning over a mossy boulder, Love in her dryad heart awoke. III White she was as a dogwood flower, Rosy white as a wild-crab bloom, Fragrant white as a haw-tree bower Full of sap and the May's perfume. He who saw her above him burning, Beautiful, naked, in dawn arrayed, Deemed her Diana, and from her turning, Leapt to his feet and fled afraid. IV Far she followed and called and pleaded, Ever he fled with never a look; Fled, till he came to this spot, deep-reeded, Came to the bank of this forest brook. Here for a moment he stopped and listened, Heard in her voice her heart's despair, Saw in her eyes the love that glistened, Sank on her bosom and rested there. V Close to her beauty she strained and pressed him, Held and bound him with kiss on kiss; Soft with her hands and her lips caressed him, Sweeter of touch than a blossom is. Spoke to his heart, and with sweet persuasion Mastered his soul till its fear was flown; Smiled on his soul till its mortal evasion Vanished, and body and soul were her own. VI Many a day had they met and mated, Many a day by this wildwood brook, When he of the forest, the god who hated, Came on their love and changed with a look. There on the shore, while they joyed and jested, He in the shadows, unseen, espied Her, like the goddess Diana breasted, Him, like Endymion by her side. VII Lo! at a word, at a sign, their folded Limbs and bodies assumed new form, Hers to the shape of a tree were molded, His to a vine with surrounding arm. . . . So they stand with their limbs enlacing, Nymph and mortal, upon this shore, He forever a vine embracing Her, a silvery sycamore. GENIUS LOCI I What wood-god, on this water's mossy curb, Lost in reflections of Earth's loveliness, Did I, just now, unconsciously disturb? I who haphazard, wandering at a guess, Came on this spot, wherein with gold and flame Of buds and blooms the Season writes its name.â Ah, me! could I have seen him ere alarm Of my approach aroused him from his calm! As he, part Hamadryad and, mayhap, Part Faun, lay here; who left the shadow warm As a wood-rose, and filled the air with balm Of his wild breath as with ethereal sap. II Does not the moss retain some slight impress, Green-dented down, of where he lay or trod? Do not the flowers, so reticent, confess With conscious looks the contact of a god? Does not the very water garrulously Boast the indulgence of a deity? And hark!âin burly beech and sycamore How all the birds proclaim it! and the leaves Rejoice with clappings of their myriad hands! And shall not I believe, too, and adore, With such wide proof?âYea, though my soul perceives No evident presence, still it understands. III And for a while it moves me to lie down Here on the spot his god-head sanctified: Mayhap some dream he dreamed may linger, brown And young as joy, around the forest side: Some dream within whose heart lives no disdain For such as I whose love is sweet and sane; That may repeat, so none but I may hearâ As one might tell a pearl-strung rosaryâ Some epic that the leaves have learned to croon, Some lyric whispered in the wildflower's ear, Whose murmurous lines are sung by bird and bee, And all the insects of the night and noon. IV For, all around me, upon field and hill, Enchantment lies as of mysterious flutes; As if the music of a god's good-will Had taken on material attributes In blooms, like chords; and in the water-gleam, That runs its silvery scales on every stream; In sunbeam bars, up which the butterfly, A golden note, vibrates then flutters onâ Inaudible tunes, blown on the pipes of Pan, That have assumed a visible entity, And drugged the air with beauty so, a Faun, Behold, I seem, and am no more a man. DITHYRAMBICS I Tempest Wrapped round of the night, as a monster is wrapped of the ocean, Down, down through vast storeys of darkness, behold, in the tower Of the heaven, the thunder! on stairways of cloudy commotion, Colossal of tread, like a giant, from echoing hour to hour Goes striding in rattling armor. . . . The Nymph, at her billow-roofed dormer Of foam; and the Sylvanâgreen-housedâat her window of leaves appears; âAs a listening woman, who hears The approach of her lover, who comes to her arms in the night; And, loosening the loops of her locks, With eyes full of love and delight, From the couch of her rest in ardor and haste arises.â The Nymph, as if born of the tempest, like fire surprises The riotous bands of the rocks, That face, with a roar, the shouting charge of the seas. The Sylvan,âthrough troops of the trees, Whose clamorous clans with gnarly bosoms keep hurling Themselves on the guns of the wind,âgoes wheeling and whirling. The Nymph, of the waves' exultation upheld, her green tresses Knotted with flowers of the hollow white foam, dives screaming; Then bounds to the arms of the storm, who boisterously presses Her hair and wild form to his breast that is panting and streaming. The Sylvan,âhard-pressed by the wind, the Pan-footed air,â On the violent backs of the hills,â Like a flame that tosses and thrills From crag to crag when the world of spirits is out,â Is borne, as her rapture wills, With glittering gesture and shout. Now here in the darkness, now there, From the rain-wild sweep of her hair,â Bewilderingly volleyed o'er eyes and o'er lips,â To the lambent swell of her limbs, her breasts and her hips, She flashes her beautiful nakedness out in the glare Of the tempest that bears her away,â That bears me away! Away, over forest and foam, over tree and spray, Far swifter than thought, far swifter than sound or than flame; Over ocean and pine, In arms of tumultuous shadow and shine.â Though Sylvan and Nymph do not Exist, and only what Of terror and beauty I feel and I name As parts of the storm, the awe and the rapture divine That here in the tempest are mine,â The two are the same, the two are forever the same. II Calm Beautiful-bosomed, O night, in thy noon Move with majesty onward! bearing, as lightly As a singer may bear the notes of an exquisite tune, The stars and the moon Through the clerestories high of the heaven, the firmament's halls: Under whose sapphirine walls, June, hesperian June, Robed in divinity wanders. Daily and nightly The turquoise touch of her robe, that the violets star, The silvery fall of her feet, that lilies are, Fill the land with languorous light and perfume.â Is it the melody mute of bourgeoning leaf and of bloom? The music of Nature, that silently shapes in the gloom Immaterial hosts Of spirits that have the flowers and leaves in their keep, That I hear, that I hear? With their sighs of silver and pearl? Invisible ghosts,â Each one a beautiful girl,â Who whisper in leaves and glimmer in blossoms and hover In color and fragrance and loveliness, breathed from the deep World-soul of the mother, Nature;âwho, over and over, Both sweetheart and lover, Goes singing her songs from one sweet month to the other,â That appear, that appear? In forest and field, on hill-land and lea, As crystallized harmony, Materialized melody, An uttered essence peopling far and near The hyaline atmosphere? . . . Behold how it sprouts from the grass and blooms from flower and tree! In waves of diaphanous moonlight and mist, In fugue upon fugue of gold and of amethyst, Around me, above me it spirals; now slower, now faster, Like symphonies born of the thought of a musical master.â O music of Earth! O God, who the music inspired! Let me breathe of the life of thy breath! And so be fulfilled and attired In resurrection, triumphant o'er time and o'er death! HYMN TO DESIRE I Mother of visions, with lineaments dulcet as numbers Breathed on the eyelids of love by music that slumbers, Secretly, sweetly, O presence of fire and snow, Thou comest mysterious, In beauty imperious, Clad on with dreams and the light of no world that we know, Deep to my innermost soul am I shaken, Helplessly shaken and tossed, And of thy tyrannous yearnings so utterly taken, My lips, unsatisfied, thirst; Mine eyes are accurst With longings for visions that far in the night are forsaken; And mine ears, in listening lost, Yearn, yearn for the note of a chord that will never awaken. II Like palpable music thou comest, like moonlight; and far,â Resonant bar upon bar,â The vibrating lyre Of the spirit responds with melodious fire, As thy fluttering fingers now grasp it and ardently shake, With flame and with flake, The chords of existence, the instrument star-sprung, Whose frame is of clay, so wonderfully molded from mire. III Vested with vanquishment, come, O Desire, Desire! Breathe in this harp of my soul the audible angel of love! Make of my heart an Israfel burning above, A lute for the music of God, that lips, which are mortal, but stammer! Smite every rapturous wire With golden delirium, rebellion and silvery clamor, CryingââAwake! awake! Too long hast thou slumbered! too far from the regions of glamour, With its mountains of magic, its fountains of faery, the spar-sprung, Hast thou wandered away, O Heart! Come, oh, come and partake Of necromance banquets of beauty; and slake Thy thirst in the waters of Art, That are drawn from the streams Of love and of dreams. IV âCome, oh come! No longer shall language be dumb! Thy vision shall graspâ As one doth the glittering hasp Of a dagger made splendid with gems and with goldâ The wonder and richness of life, not anguish and hate of it merely. And out of the stark Eternity, awful and dark, Immensity silent and cold,â Universe-shaking as trumpets, or thunderous metals That cymbal; yet pensive and pearly And soft as the rosy unfolding of petals, Or crumbling aroma of blossoms that wither too early,â The majestic music of Death, where he plays On the organ, eternal and vast, of eons and days.â NYMPH AND FAUN With her soft face half turned to me Like an arrested moonbeam, she Stood in the cirque of that deep tree. I took her by the hands; she raised Her face to mine; and, half amazed, I kissed her; and we stood and gazed. How good to kiss her throat and hair, And say no word!âHer throat was bare, And, as the slim moon, young and fair.â Had God not given us life for this? The world-old, amorous happiness Of arms that clasp, and lips that kiss. O eloquence of limbs and arms! O rhetoric of breasts, whose charms Say to the sluggish blood what warms! Had God not smiled upon this hour That bloomed,âwhere love had all of power,â The senses' aphrodisiac flower? The dawn was far away: the night Hung savage stars of sultry white, Lamp-like, above to give us light. Night, night, who led us each to each, Where heart with heart could hold sweet speech, With life's best gift within our reach. And here it wasâbetween the goals Of flesh and spirit, sex controlsâ Took place the marriage of our souls. PARTING OF LEANDER AND HERO I Brows pale through blue-black tresses Wet with the rain's cold kisses; Hair that the sea-wind tosses, Wild as wild wings in flight; Pale brows, some sad thought crosses, One kiss and thenâgood night. II Nay, love! thou wilt undo me When in the heavy waves!â Come, smile! and make unto me The billows' backs as slaves To bear me and indue me With strength o'er ocean's graves. III Weep not, as heavy-hearted Before I go! lest thou Shouldst follow as we parted.â Come, gaze at me glad-hearted! Not with sweet lips distorted With fear; and eyes tear-smarted!â Let me remember how Thy face looks when thou smilest And with soft words beguilest My soul.âFrom feet to brow, Come, strengthen thy strong lover To breast the waves that cover Deep caves where sea-nymphs hover, Eager to seize him now. IV Thy image, love, shall follow With breast pressed close to mine: With arms from out whose hollow No death can tear me. Follow, Come, light me through the brine, Dark eyes, fixed bright on mine, And mouth as red as wine!â Yea, give me wine of kisses, Whose fire shall help me home, Sweetheart, through foam that hisses, The long wild miles of foam. V Sweet! cease thy sighs and weeping! 'Tis time for rest and sleeping, And Venus-vestured dreams, Where thy Leander, stooping, Thou'lt see as now, undrooping, With eyes all unaccusing: Not as thou saw'st, it seems, In sleep last night, in dreams, His curls with ocean oozing, And wan of cheek and brow: But, Hero, even as now, Fair-favored as can make him Thy smile, which is a might, A hope, a god, to take him Safe through this hell of night. VI Here in thy throat's white hollow One last long kiss.âI go.â Ah, Sweet! a kiss to follow Down from thy throat's white hollow Unto thy breast that's whiter:â Thine arms, that clasp me tighter; One kiss then on thy mouth, Warmer than all the South; And eyes, than waters brighter Wherein the far stars glow. Smile on me now I leave thee!â And kiss me on the brow!â Smile on me, love, nor grieve thee! No thing can harm me now! THE SPIRIT OF THE FOREST SPRING Over the rocks she trails her locks, Her mossy locks that drip, drip, drip: Her sparkling eyes smile at the skies In friendship-wise and fellowship: While the gleam and glance of her countenance Lull into trance the woodland places, As over the rocks she trails her locks, Her dripping locks that the long fern graces. She pours clear ooze from her heart's cool cruse, Its crystal cruse that drips, drips, drips: And all the day its crystal spray Is heard to play from her finger-tips: And the slight, soft sound makes haunted ground Of the woods around that the sunlight laces, As she pours clear ooze from her heart's cool cruse, Its dripping cruse that no man traces. She swims and swims with glimmering limbs, With lucid limbs that drip, drip, drip: Where beechen boughs build a leafy house, Where her form may drowse or her feet may trip; And the liquid beat of her rippling feet Makes three times sweet the forest mazes, As she swims and swims with glimmering limbs, With dripping limbs through the twilight's hazes. Then wrapped in deeps of the wild she sleeps, She whispering sleeps and drips, drips, drips; Where moon and mist wreathe neck and wrist, And, starry-whist, through the night she slips: While the heavenly dream of her soul makes gleam The falls that stream and the foam that races, As wrapped in deeps of the wild she sleeps, She dripping sleeps or starward gazes. TO A PANSY-VIOLET Found Solitary Among the Hills I O pansy-violet, With early April wet, How frail and lone you look Lost in this sylvan nook Of heaven-holding hills: Down which the hurrying rills Fling scrolls of melodies; O'er which the birds and bees Weave gossamers of song, Invisible, but strong: Sweet music-webs they spin To snare the spirit in. II O pansy-violet, Unto your face I set My lips, andâdo you speak? Or is it but some freak Of fancy, love imparts Through you unto the heart's Desire? whispering low A secret none may know But me, who sit and dream Here by this forest-stream. III O pansy-violet, O wilding floweret, Hued like some dÃ¦dal gem Starring the diadem Of fay or sylvan sprite, Who, in the woods, all night Is busy with the blooms, Young leaves and wild perfumes, Through you I seem t' have seen All that our dreams may mean. IV O pansy-violet, Long, long ago we metâ 'Twas in a Fairy tale: Two children in a vale Sat underneath the stars, Far from the world of wars: Each loved the other well: Her eyes were like the spell Of dusk and dawning skiesâ The purple dark that dyes The midnight: his were blue As heaven the day shines through. V O pansy-violet, What is this vague regret, This yearning, so like tears, That touches me through years Long past, when myth and fable In all strange things were able To beautify the Earth, Things of immortal worth?â This longing, that to me Is like a memory, Lived long ago, of two Fair forest children who Loved with no mortal love; Whom heaven smiled above, Fostering; and when they died Laid side by loving side. VI O pansy-violet, Do you remember yet That wood-god-guarded tomb, Out of whose moss your bloom Sprang, with three petals wan As are the eyes of dawn; And two as darkly deep As are the eyes of sleep? VII O flower,âthat seems to hold Some memory of old, A hope, a happiness, At which I can but guess,â You are a sign to me Of immortality: Through you my spirit sees The deathless purposes Of death, that still evolves The beauty it resolves; The change that still fulfils Life's meaning as God wills. PAGAN The gods, who could loose and bind In the long ago, The gods, who were stern and kind To men below, Where shall we seek and find, Or, finding, know? Where Greece, with king on king, Dreamed in her halls; Where Rome kneeled worshipping, The owl now calls, And clambering ivies cling, And the moonbeam falls. They have served, and passed away From the earth and sky, And their creeds are a record gray, Where the passer-by Reads, âLive and be glad to-day, For to-morrow ye die.â And shall it be so, indeed, When we are no more, That nations to be shall read,â As we have before,â In the dust of a Christian Creed, But pagan lore? BEAUTY AND ART The gods are dead; but still for me Lives on in wildwood brook and tree Each myth, each old divinity. For me still laughs among her rocks The Naiad; and the Dryad's locks Drop perfume on the wildflower flocks. The Satyr's hoof still prints the loam; And, whiter than the wind-blown foam, The Oread haunts her mountain home. To him, whose mind is fain to dwell With loveliness no time can quell, All things are real, imperishable. To himâwhatever facts may sayâ Who sees the soul beneath the clay, Is proof of a diviner day. The very stars and flowers preach A gospel old as God, and teach Philosophy a child may reach; That can not die; that shall not cease; That lives through idealities Of Beauty, ev'n as Rome and Greece: That lifts the soul above the clod, And, working out some period Of art, is part and proof of God. THE OLD WATER-MILL Wild ridge on ridge the wooded hills arise, Between whose breezy vistas gulfs of skies Pilot great clouds like towering argosies, And hawk and buzzard breast the azure breeze. With many a foaming fall and glimmering reach Of placid murmur, under elm and beech, The creek goes twinkling through long gleams and glooms Of woodland quiet, summered with perfumes: The creek, in whose clear shallows minnow-schools Glitter or dart; and by whose deeper pools The blue kingfishers and the herons haunt; That, often startled from the freckled flaunt Of blackberry-liliesâwhere they feed and hideâ Trail a lank flight along the forestside With eery clangor. Here a sycamore, Smooth, wave-uprooted, builds from shore to shore A headlong bridge; and there, a storm-hurled oak Lays a long dam, where sand and gravel choke The water's lazy way. Here mistflower blurs Its bit of heaven; there the oxeye stirs Its gloaming hues of pearl and gold; and here, A gray, cool stain, like dawn's own atmosphere, The dim wild-carrot lifts its crumpled crest: And over all, at slender flight or rest, The dragon-flies, like coruscating rays Of lapis-lazuli and chrysoprase, Drowsily sparkle through the summer days: And, dewlap-deep, here from the noontide heat The bell-hung cattle find a cool retreat; And through the willows girdling the hill, Now far, now near, borne as the soft winds will, Comes the low rushing of the water-mill. Ah, lovely to me from a little child, How changed the place! wherein once, undefiled, The glad communion of the sky and stream Went with me like a presence and a dream. Where once the brambled meads and orchard-lands Poured ripe abundance down with mellow hands Of summer; and the birds of field and wood Called to me in a tongue I understood; And in the tangles of the old rail-fence Even the insect tumult had some sense, And every sound a happy eloquence: And more to me than wisest books can teach The wind and water said; whose words did reach My soul, addressing their magnificent speech,â Raucous and rushing,âfrom the old mill-wheel, That made the rolling mill-cogs snore and reel, Like some old ogre in a fairy tale Nodding above his meat and mug of ale. How memory takes me back the ways that leadâ As when a boyâthrough woodland and through mead! To orchards fruited; or to fields in bloom; Or briery fallows, like a mighty room, Through which the winds swing censers of perfume, And where deep blackberries spread miles of fruit;â A splendid feast, that stayed the ploughboy's foot When to the tasseling acres of the corn He drove his team, fresh in the primrose morn; And from the liberal banquet, nature lent, Took dewy handfuls as he whistling went.â A boy once more, I stand with sunburnt feet And watch the harvester sweep down the wheat; Or laze with warm limbs in the unstacked straw Nearby the thresher, whose insatiate maw Devours the sheaves, hot drawling out its humâ Like some great sleepy bee, above a bloom, Made drunk with honeyâwhile, grown big with grain, The bulging sacks receive the golden rain. Again I tread the valley, sweet with hay, And hear the bob-white calling far away, Or wood-dove cooing in the elder-brake; Or see the sassafras bushes madly shake As swift, a rufous instant, in the glen The red fox leaps and gallops to his den; Or, standing in the violet-colored gloam, Hear roadways sound with holiday riding home From church, or fair, or county barbecue, Which the whole country to some village drew. How spilled with berries were its summer hills, And strewn with walnuts all its autumn rillsâ And chestnuts, burring from the spring's long flowers!â When from their tops the trees seemed streaming showers Of slender silver, cool, crepuscular, And like a nebulous radiance shone afar.â And maples! how their sappy hearts would gush Rude troughs of syrup, when the winter bush Steamed with the sugar-kettle, day and night, And, red, the snow was streaked with firelight. Then was it glorious! the mill-dam's edge, One slope of frosty crystal, laid a ledge Of pearl across; above which, sleeted trees Tossed arms of ice, that, clashing in the breeze, Tinkled the ringing creek with icicles, Thin as the peal of far-off Elfland bells: A sound that in my city dreams I hear, That brings before me, under skies that clear, The old mill in its winter garb of snow, Its frozen wheel like a hoar beard below, And its west windows, two deep eyes aglow. Ah, ancient mill, still do I picture o'er Thy cobwebbed stairs and loft and grain-strewn floor; Thy door,âlike some brown, honest hand of toil, And honorable with labor of the soil,â Forever open; through which, on his back The prosperous farmer bears his bursting sack, And while the miller measures out his toll, Again I hear, above the cogs' loud roll,â That makes stout joist and rafter groan and sway,â The harmless gossip of the passing day: Good country talk, that tells how so-and-so Has died or married; how curculio And codling-moth have ruined half the fruit, And blight plays mischief with the grapes to boot; Or what the news from town; next county fair; How well the crops are looking everywhere: Now this, now that, on which their interests fix, Prospects for rain or frost, and politics. While all around, the sweet smell of the meal Filters, warm-pouring from the grinding wheel Into the bin; beside which, mealy white, The miller looms, dim in the dusty light. Again I see the miller's home, between The crinkling creek and hills of beechen green: Again the miller greets me, gaunt and brown, Who oft o'erawed my youth with gray-browed frown And rugged mien: again he tries to reach My youthful mind with fervid scriptural speech.â For he, of all the country-side confessed, The most religious was and goodliest; A Methodist, and one whom faith still led, No books except the Bible had he readâ At least so seemed it to my younger head.â All things in Earth and Heav'n he'd prove by this, Be it a fact or mere hypothesis; For to his simple wisdom, reverent, âThe Bible saysâ was all of argument.â God keep his soul! his bones were long since laid Among the sunken gravestones in the shade Of those black-lichened rocks, that wall around The family burying-ground with cedars crowned; Where bristling teasel and the brier combine With clambering wood-rose and the wild-grape vine To hide the stone whereon his name and dates Neglect, with mossy hand, obliterates. THE RAIN-CROW I Can freckled August,âdrowsing warm and blond Beside a wheat-shock in the white-topped mead, In her hot hair the oxeyed daisies wound,â O bird of rain, lend aught but sleepy heed To thee? when no plumed weed, no feather'd seed Blows by her; and no ripple breaks the pond, That gleams like flint within its rim of grasses, Through which the dragon-fly forever passes Like splintered diamond. II Drouth weights the trees, and from the farmhouse eaves The locust, pulse-beat of the summer day, Throbs; and the lane, that shambles under leaves Limp with the heatâa league of rutty wayâ Is lost in dust; and sultry scents of hay Breathe from the panting meadows heaped with sheavesâ Now, now, O bird, what hint is there of rain, In thirsty heaven or on burning plain, That thy keen eye perceives? III But thou art right. Thou prophesiest true. For hardly hast thou ceased thy forecasting, When, up the western fierceness of scorched blue, Great water-carrier winds their buckets bring Brimming with freshness. How their dippers ring And flash and rumble! lavishing large dew On corn and forestland, that, streaming wet, Their hilly backs against the downpour set, Like giants, loom in view. IV The butterfly, safe under leaf and flower, Has found a roof, knowing how true thou art; The bumblebee, within the last half-hour, Has ceased to hug the honey to its heart; While in the barnyard, under shed and cart, Brood-hens have housed.âBut I, who scorned thy power, Barometer of the birds,âlike August there,â Beneath a beech, dripping from foot to hair, Like some drenched truant, cower. THE HARVEST MOON I Globed in Heav'n's tree of azure, golden mellow As some round apple hung High on Hesperian boughs, thou hangest yellow The branch-like clouds among: Within thy light a sunburnt youth, named Health, Rests 'mid the tasseled shocks, the tawny stubble; And by his side, clad on with rustic wealth Of field and farm, beneath thy amber bubble, A nut-brown maid, Content, sits smiling still: While through the quiet trees, The mossy rocks, the grassy hill, Thy silvery spirit glides to yonder mill, Around whose wheel the breeze And shimmering ripples of the water play, As, by their mother, little children may. II Sweet Spirit of the Moon, who walkest,âlifting, Exhaustless on thy arm, A vase of pearly fire,âthrough the shifting Cloud-halls of calm and storm, Pour down thy blossoms! let me hear them come, Pelting with noiseless light the twinkling thickets, Making the darkness audible with the hum Of many insect creatures, grigs and crickets: Until it seems the elves hold revelries By haunted stream and grove; Or, in the night's deep peace, The young-old presence of Earth's full increase Seems telling thee her love, Ere, lying down, she turns to rest, and smiles, Hearing thy heart beat through the myriad miles. FIELD AND FOREST CALL There is a field, that leans upon two hills, Foamed o'er of flowers and twinkling with clear rills; That in its girdle of wild acres bears; The anodyne of rest that cures all cares; Wherein soft wind and sun and sound are blent And fragranceâas in some old instrument Sweet chordsâcalm things, that nature's magic spell Distils from heaven's azure crucible, And pours on Earth to make the sick mind well. There lies the path, they sayâ Come, away! come, away! There is a forest, lying 'twixt two streams, Sung through of birds and haunted of dim dreams; That in its league-long hand of trunk and leaf Lifts a green wand that charms away all grief; Wrought of quaint silence and the stealth of things, Vague, whispering touches, gleams and twitterings, Dews and cool shadowsâthat the mystic soul Of nature permeates with suave control, And waves o'er Earth to make the sad heart whole. There lies the road, they sayâ Come, away! come, away! OLD HOMES Old homes among the hills! I love their gardens, Their old rock-fences, that our day inherits; Their doors, round which the great trees stand like wardens; Their paths, down which the shadows march like spirits; Broad doors and paths that reach bird-haunted gardens. I see them gray among their ancient acres, Severe of front, their gables lichen-sprinkled,â Like gentle-hearted, solitary Quakers, Grave and religious, with kind faces wrinkled,â Serene among their memory-hallowed acres. Their gardens, banked with roses and with liliesâ Those sweet aristocrats of all the flowersâ Where Springtime mints her gold in daffodillies, And Autumn coins her marigolds in showers, And all the hours are toilless as the lilies. I love their orchards where the gay woodpecker Flits, flashing o'er you, like a wingÃ©d jewel; Their woods, whose floors of moss the squirrels checker With half-hulled nuts; and where, in cool renewal, The wild brooks laugh, and raps the red woodpecker. Old homes! old hearts! Upon my soul forever Their peace and gladness lie like tears and laughter; Like love they touch me, through the years that sever, With simple faith; like friendship, draw me after The dreamy patience that is theirs forever. A MEMORY Above her, pearl and rose the heavens lay: Around her, flowers scattered earth with gold, Or down the path in insolence held swayâ Like cavaliers who ride the king's highwayâ Scarlet and buff, within a garden old. Beyond the hills, faint-heard through belts of wood, Bells, Sabbath-sweet, swooned from some far-off town: Gamboge and gold, broad sunset colors strewed The purple west as if, with God imbued, Her mighty pallet Nature there laid down. Amid such flowers, underneath such skies, Embodying all life knows of sweet and fair, She stood; love's dreams in girlhood's face and eyes, Fair as a star that comes to emphasize The mingled beauty of the earth and air. Behind her, seen through vines and orchard trees, Gray with its twinkling windowsâlike the face Of calm old-age that sits and smiles at easeâ Porched with old roses, haunts of honey-bees, The homestead loomed dim in a glimmering space. For whom she waited in the afterglow, Soft-eyed and dreamy 'mid the poppy and rose, I do not know, I do not care to know:â It is enough I keep her picture so, Hung up, like poetry, in my life's dull prose. A fragrant picture, where I still may find Her face untouched of sorrow or regret, Unspoiled of contact, ever young and kind, The spiritual sweetheart of my soul and mind, She had not been, perhaps, if we had met. DOLCE FAR NIENTE I Over the bay as our boat went sailing Under the skies of Augustine, Far to the east lay the ocean paling Under the skies of Augustine.â There, in the boat as we sat together, Soft in the glow of the turquoise weather, Light as the foam or a seagull's feather, Fair of form and of face serene, Sweet at my side I felt you lean, As over the bay our boat went sailing Under the skies of Augustine. II Over the bay as our boat went sailing Under the skies of Augustine, Pine and palm, in the west, hung, trailing Under the skies of Augustine.â Was it the wind that sighed above you? Was it the wave that whispered of you? Was it my soul that said, âI love youâ? Was it your heart that murmured between, Answering, shy as a bird unseen? As over the bay our boat went sailing Under the skies of Augustine. III Over the bay as our boat went sailing Under the skies of Augustine, Gray and low flew the heron, wailing Under the skies of Augustine.â Naught was spoken. We watched the simple Gulls wing past. Your hat's white wimple Shadowed your eyes. And your lips, a-dimple, Smiled and seemed from your soul to wean An inner beauty, an added sheen, As over the bay our boat went sailing Under the skies of Augustine. IV Over the bay as our boat went sailing Under the skies of Augustine, Red on the marshes the day flamed, failing Under the skies of Augustine.â Was it your thought, or the transitory Gold of the west, like a written story, Bright on your brow, that I read? the glory And grace of love, like a rose-crowned queen Pictured pensive in mind and mien? As over the bay our boat went sailing Under the skies of Augustine. V Over the bay as our boat went sailing Under the skies of Augustine, Wan on the waters the mist lay, veiling Under the skies of Augustine.â Was it the joy that begot the sorrow?â Joy that was filled with the dreams that borrow Prescience sad of a far To-morrow,â There in the Now that was all too keen, That shadowed the fate that might intervene? As over the bay our boat went sailing Under the skies of Augustine. VI Over the bay as our boat went sailing Under the skies of Augustine, The marsh-hen cried and the tide was ailing Under the skies of Augustine.â And so we parted. No vows were spoken. No faith was plighted that might be broken. But deep in our hearts each bore a token Of life and of love and all they mean, Beautiful, thornless, and ever green, From over the bay where our boat went sailing Under the skies of Augustine. St. Augustine, Fla., February, 1899. THE PURPLE VALLEYS Far in the purple valleys of illusion I see her waiting, like the soul of music, With deep eyes, lovelier than cerulean pansies, Shadow and fire, yet merciless as poison; With red lips sweeter than Arabian storax, Yet bitterer than myrrh. O tears and kisses! O eyes and lips, that haunt my soul forever! Again Spring walks transcendent on the mountains: The woods are hushed: the vales are full of shadows: Above the heights, steeped in a thousand splendors, Like some vast canvas of the gods, hangs burning The sunset's wild sciography: and slowly The moon treads heaven's proscenium,ânight's stately White queen of love and tragedy and madness. Again I know forgotten dreams and longings; Ideals lost; desires dead and buried Beside the altar sacrifice erected Within the heart's high sanctuary. Strangely Again I know the horror and the rapture, The utterless awe, the joy akin to anguish, The terror and the worship of the spirit. Again I feel her eyes pierce through and through me; Her deep eyes, lovelier than imperial pansies, Velvet and flame, through which her strong will holds me, Powerless and tame, and draws me on and onward To sad, unsatisfied and animal yearnings, Wild, unrestrainedâthe brute within the humanâ To fling me panting on her mouth and bosom. Again I feel her lips like ice and fire, Her red lips, odorous as Arabian storax, Fragrance and fire, within whose kiss destruction Lies serpent-like. Intoxicating languors Resistlessly embrace me, soul and body; And we go drifting, driftingâshe is laughingâ Outcasts of God, into the deep's abysm. THE LAND OF ILLUSION I So we had come at last, my soul and I, Into that land of shadowy plain and peak, On which the dawn seemed ever about to break, On which the day seemed ever about to die. II Long had we sought fulfillment of our dreams, The everlasting wells of Joy and Youth; Long had we sought the snow-white flow'r of Truth, That blooms eternal by eternal streams. III And, fonder still, we hoped to find the sweet Immortal presence, Love; the bird Delight Beside her; and, eyed with sideral night, Faith, like a lion, fawning at her feet. IV But, scorched and barren, in its arid well We found our dreams' forgotten fountainhead; And by black, bitter waters, crushed and dead, Among wild weeds, Truth's trampled asphodel. V And side by side with pallid Doubt and Pain, Not Love, but Grief did meet us there: afar We saw her, like a melancholy star, A pensive moon, move towards us o'er the plain. VI Sweet was her face as song that tells of home; And filled our hearts with vague, suggestive spells Of pathos, as sad ocean fills its shells With sympathetic moanings of the foam. VII She raised one hand and pointed silently, And passed; her eyes, gaunt with a thirst unslaked, Were worlds of woe, where tears in torrents ached, Yet never fell. And like a winter sea,â VIII Whose caverned crags are haunts of wreck and wrath, That house the condor pinions of the storm,â My soul replied; and, weeping, arm in arm, To'ards those dim hills, by that appointed path, IX We turned and went. Arrived, we did discern How Beauty beckoned, white 'mid miles of flowers, Through which, behold, the amaranthine Hours Like maidens went, each holding high an urn; X Wherein, it seemedâdrained from long chalices Of those slim flowersâthey bore mysterious wine; A poppied vintage, full of sleep divine, And pale forgetting of all miseries. XI Then to my soul I said, âNo longer weep. Come, let us drink; for hateful is the sky, And earth is full of care, and life's a lie. So let us drink; yea, let us drink and sleep.â XII Then from their brimming urns we drank sweet must, While all around us rose-crowned faces laughed Into our own: but hardly had we quaffed When, one by one, these crumbled into dust. XIII And league on league the eminence of blooms, That flashed and billowed like a summer sea, Rolled out a waste of thorns and tombs; where bee And butterfly and bird hung dead in looms XIV Of worm and spider. And through tomb and brier, A thin wind, parched with bitter salt and sand, Went wailing as if mourning some lost land Of perished empire, Babylon or Tyre. XV Long, long with blistered feet we wandered in That land of ruins, through whose sky of brass Hate's harpy shrieked; and in whose iron grass The hydra hissed of undestroyable Sin. XVI And there at last, behold, the House of Doom,â Red, as if Hell had glared it into life, Blood-red, and howling with incessant strife,â With burning battlements, towered through the gloom. XVII And throned within sat Darkness.âWho might gaze Upon that form, that threatening presence there, Crowned with the flickering corpse-lights of Despair, And yet escape sans madness and amaze? XVIII And we had hoped to find among these hills The House of Beauty!âCurst, yea thrice accurst, The hope that lures one on from last to first With vain illusions that no time fulfills! XIX Why will we struggle to attain, and strive, When all we gain is but an empty dream?â Better, unto my thinking, doth it seem To end it all and let who will survive: XX To find at last all beauty is but dust: That love and sorrow are the very same: That joy is only suffering's sweeter name: And sense is but the synonym of lust. XXI Far better, yea, to me it seems, to die! To set glad lips against the lips of Deathâ The only thing God gives that comforteth, The only thing we do not find a lie. THE LAST SONG She sleeps: he sings to her: the day was long, And, tired out with too much happiness, She fain would have him sing of old Provence; Old songs, that spoke of love in such soft tones, Her restless soul was straight besieged of dreams, And her wild heart beleaguered of deep peace, And heart and soul surrendered unto sleep.â Like perfect sculpture in the moon she lies, Its pallor on her through heraldic panes Of one tall casement's gulÃ©d quarterings.â Beside her couch, an antique table, weighed With gold and crystal; here, a carven chair, Whereon her raiment,âthat suggests sweet curves Of shapely beauty,âbearing her limbs' impress, Is richly laid: and, near the chair, a glass, An oval mirror framed in ebony: And, dim and deep,âinvesting all the room With ghostly life of woven women and men, And strange, fantastic gloom, where shadows move,â Dark tapestry,âwhich in the gustsâthat twinge A dropping cresset's slender star of lightâ Seems swayed of cautious hands, assassin-like, That bide their hour. She alone, deep-haired As golden dawn, and whiter than a rose, Divinely breasted as the Queen of Love, Lies robeless in the glimmer of the moon, Like DanaÃ« within the golden shower. Seated beside her aromatic rest, In silence musing on her loveliness, Her knight and troubadour. A lute, aslope The curious baldric of his tunic, glints Pearl-caught reflections of the moon, that seem The voiceless ghosts of long-dead melodies. In purple and sable, slashed with solemn gold, Like stately twilight over slopes of snow, He leans above her.â Have his hands forgot Their craft, that now they pause upon the strings? His lips, their art, that they cease, speechless there?â His eyes are set . . . What is it stills to stone His hands? his lips? and mails him, head and heel, In terrible marble, motionless and cold?â Behind the arras, can it be he feels, Black-browed and grim, with eyes of sombre fire, Death towers above him with uplifted sword? THE DREAM OF RODERICK Below, the tawny Tagus swept Past royal gardens, breathing balm: Upon his couch the monarch slept; The world was still; the night was calm. Gray, Gothic-gated, in the ray Of moonrise, tower and castle-crowned, The city of Toledo lay Beneath the terraced palace-ground. Again, he dreamed, in kingly sport He sought the tree-sequestered path, And watched the ladies of his Court Within the marble-basined bath. Its porphyry stairs and fountained base Shone, houried with voluptuous forms, Where Andalusia vied in grace With old Castile, in female charms. And laughter, song, and water-splash Rang round the place, with rock arcaded, As here a breast or limb would flash Where beauty swam or beauty waded. And then, like Venus, from the wave A maiden came, and stood below; And by her side a woman slave Bent down to dry her limbs of snow. Then on the tesselated bank, Robed on with fragrance and with fire,â Like some exotic flowerâshe sank, The type of all divine desire. Then her dark curls, that sparkled wet, She parted from her perfect brows, And, lo, her eyes, like lamps of jet Lit in an alabaster house. And in his sleep the monarch sighed, âFlorinda!ââDreaming still he moaned, âAh, would that I had died, had died! I have atoned! I have atoned!â . . . And then the vision changed: O'erhead Tempest and darkness were unrolled, Full of wild voices of the dead, And lamentations manifold. And wandering shapes of gaunt despair Swept by; and faces pale with pain, Whose eyes wept blood and seemed to glare Fierce curses on him through the rain. And then, it seemed, 'gainst blazing skies A necromantic tower sate, Crag-like on crags, of giant size; With adamatine wall and gate. And from the storm a hand of might, Red-rolled in thunder, reached among The gate's huge bolts, that burstâand night Clanged ruin as its hinges swung. Then far away a murmur trailed,â As of sad seas on cavern'd shores,â That grew into a voice that wailed, âThey come! they come! the Moors! the Moors!â And with deep boom of atabals And crash of cymbals and wild peal Of battle-bugles, from its walls An army rushed in glimmering steel. And where it trod he saw the torch Of conflagration stalk the skies, And in the vanward of its march The monster form of Havoc rise. And Paynim war-cries rent the storm, Athwart whose firmament of flame Destruction reared an earthquake form On wreck and death without a name. . . . And then again the vision changed: Where flows the Guadelete, see, The champions of the Cross are ranged Against the Crescent's chivalry. With roar of trumpets and of drums They meet; and in the battle's van He fights; and, towering towards him, comes Florinda's father, Julian; And one-eyed Taric, great in war: And where these couch their burning spears, The Christian phalanx, near and far, Goes down like corn before the shears. The Moslem wins: the Christian flies: âAllah il Allah,â hill and plain Reverberate: the rocking skies, âAllah il Allah,â shout again. And then he dreamed the swing of swords And hurl of arrows were no more; And stranger than the howling hordes Deep silence fell on field and shore. And through the night, it seemed, he fled, Upon a white steed like a star, Across a field of endless dead, Beneath a blood-red scimitar Of sunset: And he heard a moan, Beneath, around, on every handâ âAccursÃ©d! Yea, what hast thou done To bring this curse upon thy land?â And then an awful sense of wings: And, lo! the answerââ'Twas his lust That was his crime. Behold! e'en kings Must reckon with Me. God is just.â ZYPS OF ZIRL The Alps of the Tyrol are dark with pines, Where, foaming under the mountain spines, The Inn's long water sounds and shines. Beyond, are peaks where the morning weaves An icy rose; and the evening leaves The golden ghosts of a thousand sheaves. Deep vines and torrents and glimmering haze, And sheep-bells tinkling on mountain ways, And fluting shepherds make sweet the days. The rolling mist, like a wandering fleece, The great, round moon in a mountain crease, And a song of love make the nights all peace. Beneath the blue Tyrolean skies On the banks of the Inn, that foams and flies, The storied city of Innsbruck lies. With its mediÃ¦val streets, that crook, And its gabled houses, it has the look Of a belfried town in a fairy book. So wild the Tyrol that oft, 'tis said, When the storm is out and the town in bed, The howling of wolves sweeps overhead. And oft the burgher, sitting here In his walled rose-garden, hears the clear Shrill scream of the eagle circling near. And this is the tale that the burghers tell:â The Abbot of Wiltau stood at his cell Where the Solstein lifts its pinnacle. A mighty summit of bluffs and crags That frowns on the Inn; where the forest stags Have worn a path to the water-flags. The Abbot of Wiltau stood below; And he was aware of a plume and bow On the precipice there in the morning's glow, A chamois, he saw, from span to span Had leapt; and after it leapt a man; And he knew 'twas the Kaiser Maximilian. But, see! though rash as the chamois he, His foot less sure. And verily If the King should miss . . . âJesu! Marie! âThe King hath missed!ââAnd, look, he falls! Rolls headlong out to the headlong walls. What Saint shall save him on whom he calls? What Saint shall save him, who struggles there On the narrow ledge by the eagle's lair, With hook'd hands clinging 'twixt earth and air? The Abbot crosses himself in dreadâ âLet prayers go up for the nearly dead, And the passing-bell be tolled,â he said. âFor the House of Hapsburg totters! See, How raveled the thread of its destiny, Sheer hung between cloud and rock!â quoth he. But hark! where the steeps of the peak reply, Is it an eagle's echoing cry? And the flitting shadow, its plumes on high? No voice of the eagle is that which rings! And the shadow, a wiry man who swings Down, down where the desperate Kaiser clings. The crampons bound to his feet, he leaps Like a chamois now; and again he creeps Or twists, like a snake, o'er the fearful deeps. âBy his cross-bow, baldric, and cap's black curl,â Quoth the Abbot below, âI know the churl! 'Tis the hunted outlaw Zyps of Zirl. âUpon whose head, or dead or alive, The Kaiser hath posted a price.âSaints shrive The King!â quoth Wiltau. âWho may contrive âTo save him now that his foe is there?ââ But, hark! again through the breathless air What words are those that the echoes bear? âCourage, my King!âTo the rescue, ho!â The wild voice rings like a twanging bow, And the staring Abbot stands mute below. And, lo! the hand of the outlaw grasps The arm of the Kingâand death unclasps Its fleshless fingers from him who gasps. And how he guides! where the clean cliffs wedge Them flat to their brows; by chasm and ledge He helps the King from the merciless edge. Then up and up, past bluffs that shun The rashest chamois; where eagles sun Great wings and brood; where the mists are spun. And safe at last stand Kaiser and churl On the mountain path where the mosses curlâ And this the revenge of Zyps of Zirl. THE GLOW-WORM How long had I sat there and had not beheld The gleam of the glow-worm till something compelled! . . . The heaven was starless, the forest was deep, And the vistas of darkness stretched silent in sleep. And late 'mid the trees had I lingered until No thing was awake but the lone whippoorwill. And haunted of thoughts for an hour I sat On a lichen-gray rock where the moss was a mat. And thinking of one whom my heart had held dear, Like terrible waters, a gathering fear Came stealing upon me with all the distress Of loss and of yearning and powerlessness: Till the hopes and the doubts and the sleepless unrest That, swallow-like, built in the home of my breast, Now hither, now thither, now heavenward flew, Wild-winged as the winds are: now suddenly drew My soul to abysses of nothingness where All light was a shadow, all hope, a despair: Where truth, that religion had set upon high, The darkness distorted and changed to a lie: And dreams of the beauty ambition had fed Like leaves of the autumn fell withered and dead. And I rose with my burden of anguish and doom, And cried, âO my God, had I died in the womb! âThan born into night, with no hope of the morn, An heir unto shadows, to live so forlorn! âAll effort is vain; and the planet called Faith Sinks down; and no power is real but death. âO light me a torch in the deepening dark So my sick soul may follow, my sad heart may mark!ââ And then in the darkness the answer!âIt came From Earth, not from Heavenâa glimmering flame, Behold, at my feet! In the shadow it shone Mysteriously lovely and dimly alone: An ember; a sparkle of dew and of glower; Like the lamp that a spirit hangs under a flower: As goldenly green as the phosphorous star A fairy may wear in her diadem's bar: An element essence of moonlight and dawn That, trodden and trampled, burns on and burns on. And hushed was my soul with the lesson of light That God had revealed to me there in the night: Though mortal its structure, material its form, The spiritual message of worm unto worm. A FOREST IDYLL I Beneath an old beech-tree They sat together, Fair as a flower was she Of summer weather. They spoke of life and love, While, through the boughs above, The sunlight, like a dove, Dropped many a feather. II And there the violet, The bluet near it, Made blurs of azure wetâ As if some spirit, Or woodland dream, had gone Sprinkling the earth with dawn, When only Fay and Faun Could see or hear it. III She with her young, sweet face And eyes gray-beaming, Made of that forest place A spot for dreaming: A spot for Oreads To smooth their nut-brown braids, For Dryads of the glades To dance in, gleaming. IV So dim the place, so blest, One had not wondered Had Dian's moonÃ©d breast The deep leaves sundered, And there on them a while The goddess deigned to smile, While down some forest aisle The far hunt thundered. V I deem that hour, perchance, Was but a mirror To show them Earth's romance And draw them nearer: A mirror where, meseems, All that this Earth-life dreams, All loveliness that gleams, Their souls saw clearer. VI Beneath an old beech-tree They dreamed of blisses; Fair as a flower was she That summer kisses: They spoke of dreams and days, Of love that goes and stays, Of all for which life prays, Ah me! and misses. UNDER THE ROSE He told a story to her, A story old yet newâ And was it of the Faery Folk That dance along the dew? The night was hung with silence As a room is hung with cloth, And soundless, through the rose-sweet hush, Swooned dim the down-white moth. Along the east a shimmer, A tenuous breath of flame, From which, as from a bath of light, Nymph-like, the girl-moon came. And pendent in the purple Of heaven, like fireflies, Bubbles of gold the great stars blew From windows of the skies. He told a story to her, A story full of dreamsâ And was it of the elfin things That haunt the thin moonbeams? Upon the hill a thorn-tree, CrookÃ©d and gnarled and gray, Against the moon seemed some crutched hag Dragging a child away. And in the vale a runnel, That dripped from shelf to shelf, Seemed in the night, a woodland witch Who muttered to herself. Along the land a zephyr, Whose breath was wild perfume, That seemed a sorceress who wove Sweet spells of beam and bloom. He told a story to her, A story young yet oldâ And was it of the mystic things Men's eyes shall ne'er behold? They heard the dew drip faintly From out the green-cupped leaf; They heard the petals of the rose Unfolding from their sheaf. They saw the wind light-footing The waters into sheen; They saw the starlight kiss to sleep The blossoms on the green. They heard and saw these wonders; These things they saw and heard; And other things within the heart For which there is no word. He told a story to her, The story men call Love, Whose echoes fill the ages pastâ And the world ne'er tires of. SPIRIT OF DREAMS I Where hast thou folded thy pinions, Spirit of Dreams? Hidden elusive garments Woven of gleams? In what divine dominions, Brighter than day, Far from the world's dark torments, Dost thou stay, dost thou stay?â When shall my yearnings reach thee Again? Not in vain let my soul beseech thee! Not in vain! not in vain! II I have longed for thee as a lover For her, the one; As a brother for a sister Long dead and gone. I have called thee over and over Names sweet to hear; With words than music trister, And thrice as dear. How long must my sad heart woo thee, Yet fail? How long must my soul pursue thee, Nor avail, nor avail? III All night hath thy loving mother, Beautiful Sleep, Lying beside me, listened And heard me weep. But ever thou soughtest another Who sought thee not; For him thy soft smile glistenedâ I was forgot. When shall my soul behold thee As before? When shall my heart enfold thee?â Nevermore? nevermore? PROCESSIONAL Universes are the pages Of that book whose words are ages; Of that book which destiny Opens in eternity. There each syllable expresses Silence; there each thought a guess is; In whose rhetoric's cosmic runes Roll the worlds and swarming moons. There the systems, we call solar, Equatorial and polar, Write their lines of rushing light On the awful leaves of night. There the comets, vast and streaming, Punctuate the heavens' gleaming Scroll; and suns, gigantic, shine, Periods to each starry line. There, initials huge, the Lion Looms and measureless Orion; And, as 'neath a chapter done, Burns the Great-Bear's colophon. Constellated, hieroglyphic, Numbering each page terrific, Fiery on the nebular black, Flames the hurling zodiac. In that book, o'er which Chaldean Wisdom poured and many an eon Of philosophy long dead, This is all that man has read:â He has read how good and evil,â In creation's wild upheaval,â Warred; while God wrought terrible At foundations red of Hell. He has read of man and woman; Laws and gods, both beast and human; Thrones of hate and creeds of lust, Vanished now and turned to dust. Arts and manners that have crumbled; Cities buried; empires tumbled: Time but breathed on them its breath; Earth is builded of their death. These but lived their little hour, Filled with pride and pomp and power; What availed it all at last? We shall pass as they have passed. Still the human heart will dream on Love, part angel and part demon; Yet, I question, what secures Our belief that aught endures? In that book, o'er which Chaldean Wisdom poured and many an eon Of philosophy long dead, This is all that man has read. SONG AND STORY TO HARRISON S. MORRIS Ah, not for us the Heavens that hold God's message of Promethean fire! The flame that fell on bards of old To hallow and inspire. Yet let the soul dream on and dare No less Song's heights where these repose: We can but fail; and may prepare The way for one like those. SONG AND STORY I was destined, when a baby, For that land which lieth hidden In the moon; and whither, may be, At their birth all souls are bidden. She bewitched me then and bound me, She a daughter of Apollo, In a golden snare who wound me, And compelled me thus to follow:â Once she sent a stallion, sired Of the Wind; a mare his mother, Whom Thessalian madness fired, And the Hurricane his brother. And a voice said, âDo not tarry! Mount him while the world is sleeping: He, my beautiful, will carry You, my Soul, into my keeping.â And I mounted: tempest whistled In my ears, and, yawning o'er us, Flamed the lightning; boomed the missiled Thunder, crashing far before us. On we hurled. The world was rubble Underneath us; and the wonder Of our passage seemed to double Heaven's tempest and its thunder. With us rode the air's wild races: Wisps and witches; all the Brocken, Stunted, gnarled, with fiendish faces, Seemed around us, gibing, mocking: Hate, that shook the heart with hooting: Humpbacked Horror; gibbet-headed Murder: and,âgreat ravens shooting Over,âFear, in bats embedded. All were left; were passed like water Hurling headlong from a mountain,â Hag and elf and demon's daughter,â Ere we reached that mystic fountain. There we stopped. I drained a beaker Old as Earth: the draught was fire: On my soul the burning liquor Acted like a new desire. On again! The darkness lifted Like an up-rolled banner. Scattered Overhead, in points that shifted, Shone the stars through tempest tattered. Then the moon rose. Slowly, slowly, Of a wild and copper color, Rose the moon, in melancholy Deeps; and all the stars grew duller. And we passed,âan instant's scanning,â Swift as thought, the spider-arches Of the ray-built bridges spanning Space between her lunar marches. So I reached her kingdom, olden As the God that was its maker, Where the rocks and trees are golden, And the sea and air are nacre. Where, 'mid ingot-glowing flowers, Over streams of diamond brightness, Palaces of pearl and towers, Wrought of topaz, loom in whiteness. Here she met me with a chalice, Like the Giamschid ruby burning; And I entered in her palace, From the world forever turning. Centuries have passed, have vanished; Still she holds me with her glory, She, whom Earth long since hath banished? She, the Soul of Song and Story. AN INDIAN LEGEND On a mountain by a fountain, By a faintly falling stream, Where upon the moss and flowers, Sparkling, fell the spray in showers, In the moonlight's mystic beam, Once a maiden came to dream, Came to sit and sigh and dream: On a mountain by a fountain, By a faintly falling stream. To the fountain on the mountain Rode a youth upon a steed; In his hair an eagle's feather; Round his waist a belt of leather, Wampum-wrought with shell and bead; In his hands a hollow reed, In his hands a magic reed: To the fountain on the mountain Rode a youth upon a steed. AN INDIAN LEGEND On the mountain by the fountain, When the moon shone overhead, While the maiden by him wavered, Low upon his reed he quavered, Piped and played and singing said,â âListen and be comforted! Heart of mine, be comforted!â On the mountain by the fountain When the moon shone overhead. By the fountain on the mountain, So the Indian legend saith, Paler, paler grew the maiden, Paler as if sorrow laden, Frailer, paler at each breath, Saying, âArt thou Love or Death?â And he answered, âI am Death.â By the fountain on the mountain So the Indian legend saith. Gone the mountain and the fountain Where the maiden's soul was lost: But in every stream you hear it Whispering, sighing, like a spirit, Hear the Indian maiden's ghost, In the foam as white as frost, Whiter than the winter's frost: Gone the mountain and the fountain Where the maiden's soul was lost. JOHN DAVIS, BOUCANIER High time, high time, good gentlemen, to sail the Spanish Main! Three months we've watched for galleons and treasure bound for Spain; Three months! and not a vessel, neither barque nor brigantine! No Cartagena plate-ship, or De Dios, have we seen. Our sails are idle as the wind, our ships as gulls or waves.â And shall inaction rot us like a gang of shackled slaves? Up, boucaniers! the land is wide, and wider far the seaâ Somewhere between the dusk and dawn and dusk some hope must be; Some ship somewhere or city there beneath the Indian skyâ What matter whether east or west!âsome ship with decks built high, With treasure packed from stem to stern: some huge ship of the line, Against whose ports we'll cram our ports, while all our cannon shine And thunder; then, with blade to blade, and shouting horde on horde, Swarm up her sides and sweep her decks with pistol and with sword; And, sink or swim, our flag flies there, we boucaniers aboard. Say, what availed your patron saints, Iago and Saint Marc, Lanceros, Adelantados, against Ravenau's barque? O butchers of good Jean Ribault, well might your cheeks turn pale When Montebaro's brigantine shook to the wind her sail! Round the coasts where New Spain boasts the haughtiness of Old, Her tyranny, her bigotry, her sordid greed for gold, From east to west, from north to south, among the Carib Isles, Swift to revenge the Frenchman swept across the foaming miles. The spirit of Pierre-le-Grand and of his gallant crew, Who took a galleon with a boat, beneath the tropic blue, Be with us now!âUp, gentlemen! and, Spain, oh, woe to you! Prime arquebus and brighten blade, and let the culverin Gleam, burnished as the morning-star, as through the foam we spin; And now be glad as when we had Granada in our hold, And stabbed the city's sentinels and took the city's gold: New Spain's good homes and churches, aye, will not forget too soon The boucanier, John Davis, sirs, who taught their Dons a tuneâ Dutch serenades of belts and blades they danced to by the moon! What helped the Latin of their monks to curse what Satan blessed! Those pieces,âbroad,âof eight and plate we counted in our chest. And now that we may double or may treble every piece, Pipe up the anchor, boatswain! and, before the hawser cease, Let every sail salute the gale and every rope be tauntâ The Devil take all care and us, if jaundiced colors daunt! The sea-gulls dip and dive and float, and swim and soar again; Be like them, merry gentlemen, high-hearted!âMay it rain Rich galleons for us!âMix a bowl and drink, âThe ships of Spain!â Be merry as the sea-gulls are; and, as the case may go, Who cares a curse for wealth!âNow drink: âHere's to Spain's overthrow!ââ Doff caps and follow: though the prize be overfat or lean, Kneel down now; give her praise who leads, Dame Fortune, our good Queen! Upon our prow she guides us now!âOn to Saint Augustine! VOYAGERS Where are they, that song and tale Tell of, lands our childhood knew? Sea-locked Fairy-lands that trail Morning summits, wet with dew, Crimson, o'er a crimson sail? Where, in dreams, we entered on Wonders eyes have never seen: Whither often we have gone, Sailing a dream-brigantine On from voyaging dawn to dawn. Leons seeking lands of song; Fabled fountains pouring spray; Where our anchors dropped among Corals of some blooming bay, With its swarthy native throng. Shoulder axe and arquebus!â We may find it, past yon range Of sierras, vaporous, Rich with gold and wild and strange, That dim region lost to us. Yet, behold, although our zeal Darien summits may subdue, Our Balboa eyes reveal But a vaster sea come to; New endeavor for our keel. Yet!âwho sails with face set hard Westward, while behind him lies Unfaith; where his dreams keep guard Round it, in the sunset skies, He may reach itâafterward. HIEROGLYPHS I All dreams are older than the seas, Being but newer forms of change; Some savage dreamed mine; and 'twas these De Leon sought where seas were strange. All thoughts are older than the Earth Being of beauty ages wrought; Old when creation gave them birth, When Homer sang them, Shakespeare thought. II If souls could travel as can thought, Beyond the farthest arcs that span Imagination, what would man Not know and see at last? One would explore the stars; and one Would search the moon and one the sun And tell us of their past. And one would seek out Hell; and, wise In tortures of the damned, return To tell us if they freeze or burn, And where God's red Hell lies: And one would look on Heaven; and, mute With memories of harp and lute, Sit silent as the skies. But Iâon condor wings would sweep To some new world, and, soaring, sit 'Mid firmaments volcano-lit, And see creation heap Its awful Andes, vague and vast, About its Inca-peopled past, While deep roared out to deep. III Out of it all but this remains:â I dreamed that I had crossed wide chains Of Cordilleras, whose huge peaks Lock in the wilds of Yucatan, Chiapas and Honduras. Weeksâ And then a city that no man Had even seen; so dim and old No chronicle has ever told The history of men who piled Its temples and huge teocallis Among mimosa-blooming valleys; Or how its altars were defiled With human blood; whose idols there With eyes of stone still stand and stare. So old, the moon can only know How old, since ancient forests grow On mighty wall and pyramid. Huge ceÃ¯bas, whose trunks were scarred With ages, and dense yuccas, hid Fanes 'mid great cacti, scarlet-starred. I looked upon its paven ways And saw it in its kingliest days; When, from its lordliest palace, one A victim, walked with prince and priest, Who turned brown faces toward the east In worship of the rising sun: At night a thousand temple spires, Of gold, burnt everlasting fires. Uxmal? Palenque? or Copan? I know not. Only how no man Had ever seen; and still my soul Believes it vaster than the three. Volcanic rock walled in the whole, Lost in the woods as in some sea. I only read its hieroglyphs, Perused its monster monoliths Of death, gigantic heads; and read The pictured codex of its fate, The perished Toltec; while in hate Mad monkeys cursed me, as if dead Priests of its past had taken form To guard their ruined fanes from harm. IV And then it was as if I talked Of gods and beauty, like a god; 'Mid Montezuma's priests who walked Obedient to my nod. From Mexic levels breezes blew O'er green magueys; cacaÃ¶ fields; I stood among caciques, a crew With plumes and golden shields. In raiment made of humming-birds Brown slave-girls danced. All Anahuac Stood, grim with strange obsidian swords, Around the idol's rock. And up the temple's winding stair Of pyramid we wound and went: The bloomed vanilla drenched the air With all its tropic scent. Volcanoes walled us in: and I Walked, crowned with flaming cactus-flowers, Beneath the golden, Aztec sky, Lord of the living hours. When, lo! five priests, who led me to A jasper stone of sacrifice!â Then deep within my soul I knew That prideful moment's price. A sixth priest, robed in cochineal, Received me at the altar's stone: I saw the flint-blade, sharp as steel, That in his high hand shone. O God! to dream that they would bindâ With pomp and pageant of their loveâ Me to the rock, and never blind Mine eyes to that above! I felt the flint hack through my breast, And in my agony did raise Wild eyes, a little while to rest Upon their idol's face. Just God! the priest tore out my heart, And held it, beating, to the sunâ Chantingâand from one burning part Great drops dripped, one by one. Torn out, I felt my heart still beat, I felt it beat with pain divine; For, bleeding at the idol's feet, My heart was pressed to thine. V You were a maiden like a dream Who led me where volcanic dust Rained in a scoriac mountain stream, Where, from Andean snows, was thrust One crater belching stones and steam. You were an Inca princess when I was a cavalier of Spain, Who frowned among Pizarro's men, And saw the New World rent with pain.â No grace of God could save me then. And it was you who led me far To gaze on caves of Inca gold: But when we came, lo! warrior On warrior, an army rolled Around us panoplied for war. Fierce faces chiseled out of stone Are not more stern.âDown, underneath, I heard the sullen earthquake groan; Above me, red eruptions seeth. And clenched my teeth and stood alone. And then you pled and was denied.â They laid me where the lava crawled, Red-rivered, down the mountain side. I felt the slow, slow hell-heat scald: And as it closed, you leapt and died. VI In farther planets there are men who talk, Not with their lips, but with their eyes alone, With beaming eyes and brows that burn with thought: Pure souls whose sentiments need but be born To be expressed. Where speech of mouth and tongue Were barbarous discord. Where no voice imparts Thought, but divulging eye and sensitive brow. Superior planets, far beyond our sphere, And nearer God than ages shall combine To lift our world up with its wrangling woes. Worlds that are strange to sickness and disease Of mind and body; perfect mentally,â Past what we name perfection here on Earth,â And physically. Morally divine As creeds have taught us God's high Heaven is. Worlds where Love makes no playmate of vile Lust; Where Hope makes no companion of Despair; Where Power can not trample with fierce feet; And, impotent, the iron hand of Might Surrenders its red weapon unto Mind; Where Truth and Thought are wedded, in one rule Of far progression, whose white child is Love. So have I dreamed, and longed to leave sad Earth, And live anew on some diviner sphere; A world so higher, lovelier than this, So spiritually perfected and refined, That, should an Earth-born mortal,âsuddenly Translated thither,âunprepared behold, Dazed with divinity, before the feet Of its inhabitants he would fall prone In worship and astonishment; and, all The exaltation of celestial peace Singing within, cry out: âYea, this is Heaven! How long, O sinner, hast thou dwelt in Hell!â VII An iron despotism the day's: A brutal anarchy the night's: What hope for hope when day betrays, And night in death delights? For, once I prayed for gulfs of gold, And morn pooled heav'n with sombre blood: For skies of stars, and skies beholdâ Malignant with the scud. And so I marvel not that he, Gray-haired and toothless, hugs his stove, While I my youth, which once was she, Have buried with my love. VIII All thoughts of nature are but forms Of life and death, with which began Love: love, that swept the heavens with storms, Evolving worlds to perfect man. Thoughts are the forms of mind; and come And go, assuming every shape: Science and art: through which we clomb, And climb, to angel from the ape. A LEGEND OF THE LILY Pale as a star that shines through rain Her face was seen at the window-pane, Her sad, frail face that watched in vain. The face of a girl whose brow was wan; To whom the kind sun spoke at dawn, And a star and the moon when the day was gone. And oft and often the sun had saidâ âO fair, white face, O sweet, fair head, Come talk to me of the love that's dead.â And she would sit in the sun a while, Down in the garth by the old stone-dial, Where never again would he make her smile. And often the first bright star o'erhead Had whispered, âSweet, where the rose blooms red, Come look with me for the love that's dead.â And she would wait with the star she knew, Where the fountain splashed and the roses blew, Where never again would he come to woo. And oft the moon, when she lay in bed, Had sighed, âDear heart, in the orchardstead Come dream with me of the love that's dead.â And she would stand in the moon, the dim, Where the fruit made heavy the apple limb, Where never again would she dream with him. So summer passed and the autumn came; And the wind-torn boughs were touched with flame; But her life and her sorrow remained the same. Or, if she changed, as it comes about A life may change through trouble and doubt,â As a candle flickers and then goes out,â 'Twas only to grow more quiet and wan, Sadly waiting at dusk and at dawn For the coming of love forever gone. And so, one night, when the star looked in, It kissed her face that was white and thin, And murmured, âCome! thou free of sin!â And when the moon, on another night, Beheld her lying still and white, It sighed, â'Tis well! now all is right.â And when one morning the sun arose, And they bore her bier down the garden-close, It touched her, saying, âAt last, repose.â And they laid her down, so young and fair, Where the grass was withered, the bough was bare, All wrapped in the light of her golden hair. So autumn passed and the winter went; And spring, like a blue-eyed penitent, Came, telling her beads of blossom and scent. And, lo! to the grave of the beautiful The strong sun cried, âWhy art thou dull? Awake! awake! Forget thy skull!â And the evening-star and the moon above Called out, âO dust, now speak thereof! Proclaim thyself! Arise, O love!â And the skull and the dust in the darkness heard. Each icy germ in its cerements stirred, As Lazarus moved at the Lord's loud word. And a flower arose on the mound of green, White as the robe of the Nazarene; To testify of the life unseen. And I paused by the grave; then went my way: And it seemed that I heard the lily sayâ âHere was a miracle wrought to-day.â THE END OF THE CENTURY There are moments when, as missions, God reveals to us strange visions; When, within their separate stations, We may see the Centuries, Like revolving constellations Shaping out Earth's destinies. I have gazed in Time's abysses, Where no smallest thing Earth misses That was hers once. 'Mid her chattels, There the Past's gigantic ghost Sits and dreams of thrones and battles In the night of ages lost. Far before her eyes, unholy Mist was spread; that darkly, slowly Rolled aside,âlike some huge curtain Hung above the land and sea;â And beneath it, wild, uncertain, Rose the wraiths of memory. First I saw colossal spectres Of dead cities: Troyâonce Hector's Pride; then Babylon and Tyre; Karnac, Carthage, and the gray Walls of Thebes,âApollo's lyre Built;âthen Rome and Nineveh. Empires followed: first, in seeming, Old Chaldea lost in dreaming; Egypt next, a bulk Memnonian Staring from her pyramids; Then Assyria, Babylonian Night beneath her hell-lit lids. Greece, in classic white, sidereal Armored; Rome, in dark, imperial Purple, crowned with blood and fire, Down the deeps barbaric strode; Gaul and Britain stalking by her, Clad in skins, tattooed with woad. All around them, rent and scattered, Lay their gods with features battered, Brute and human, stone and iron, Caked with gems and gnarled with gold; Temples, that did once environ These, in wreck around them rolled. While I stood and gazed and waited, Slowly night obliterated All; and other phantoms drifted Out of darkness pale as stars; Shapes that tyrant faces lifted, Sultans, kings, and emperors. Man and steed in ponderous metal Panoplied, they seemed to settle, Condors gaunt of devastation, On the world: behind their marchâ Desolation: Conflagration Loomed before them with her torch. Helmets flamed like fearful flowers: Chariots rose and moving towers: Captains passed: each fierce commander With his gauntlet on his sword: Agamemnon, Alexander, CÃ¦sar, Alaric, horde on horde. Huns and Vandals: wild invaders: Goths and Arabs: stern Crusaders: Each, like some terrific torrent, Rolled above a ruined world; Till a cataract abhorrent Seemed the swarming spears uphurled. Banners and escutcheons, kindled By the light of slaughter, dwindledâ Died in darkness:âthe chimera Of the Past was laid at last. But, behold, another era From her corpse rose, vague and vast. Demogorgon of the Present! Who in one hand raised a Crescent, In the other, with submissive Fingers, lifted up a Cross; Reverent and yet derisive Seemed she, robed in gold and dross. In her skeptic eyes professions Of great faith I saw; expressions, Christian and humanitarian, Played around her cynic lip; Still I knew her a barbarian By the sword upon her hip. And she cherished strange eidolons, Pagan shadowsâPlato's, Solon'sâ From whose teachings she indentured Forms of law and sophistry; Seeking aye for truth she ventured Just so far as these could see. When she vanished, Iâuplifting Eyes to where the dawn was rifting Darkness,âlo! beheld a shadow Towering on Earth's utmost peaks; Round whom morning's El Dorado Rivered gold in blinding streaks. On her brow I saw the stigma Still of death; and life's enigma Filled her eyes: around her shimmered Folds of silence; and afar, Faint above her forehead, glimmered Lone the light of one pale star. Then a voice,âabove or under Earth,âagainst her seemed to thunder Questions, wherein was repeated, âChrist or Cain?â and âMan or beast?â And the Future, shadowy-sheeted, Turned and pointed towards the East. THE ISLE OF VOICES The wind blew free that morn that we, High-hearted, sailed away; Bound for that Island named the Blest, Remote within the unknown West, Beyond the golden day. There, we were told, each dream of old, Each deed and dream of youth, Each myth of life's divinest prime, And every romance, dear to time, Put on immortal truth. The love undone; the aim unwon; The hope that turned despair; The thought unborn; the dream that died; The unattained, unsatisfied, Should be accomplished there. So we believed. And, undeceived, A little crew set sail; A little crew with hearts as stout As any yet that faced a doubt And tore away its veil. And time went by; and sea and sky Had worn our masts and decks; When, lo! one morn with canvas torn, A phantom ship, we came forlorn Into the Sea of Wrecks. There, day and night, the mist lay white, And pale stars shone at noon; The sea around was foam and fire, And overhead hung, thin as wire, A will-o'-wisp of moon. And through the mist, all white and whist, Gaunt ships, with sea-weed wound, With rotting masts, upon whose spars The corposants lit spectre stars, Sailed by without a sound. And all about,ânow in, now out,â Their ancient hulls, was shed The worm-like glow of green decay, That writhed and glimmered in the gray Of canvas overhead. And each that passed, in hull and mast, Seemed that wild ship that flees Before the tempestâseamen tellâ Deep-cargoed with the curse of Hell, Through roaring rain and seas. Ay! many a craft we left abaft Upon that haunted sea; But never a hulk that clewed a sail, Or waved a hand, or answered hail, And never a man saw we. At last we came whereâpouring flameâ In darkness and in storm, Vast a volcano westward reared An awful summit, lava-seared, Like some terrific arm. And we could feel beneath our keel The ocean throb and swell, As if the Earthquake there uncoiled Its monster bulk, or Titans toiled At the red heart of Hell. Like madmen now we turned our prow North, towards an ocean weird Of Northern Lights and icy blasts; And for ten moons with reeling masts And leaking hold we steered. Then black as blood through streaming scud Land loomed above our boom, An isle of iron gulfs and crags And cataracts, like wind-tossed rags, And caverns lost in gloom. And burning white on every height, And white in every cave, A naked spirit, like a flame, Now gleamed, now vanished; went and came Above the windy wave. No mortal thing of foot or wing Made glad its steep or strand; But voices, voices seeminglyâ Vague voices of the sky and seaâ Peopled the demon land. Yea, everywhere, in earth and air, A lamentation wept; That, gathering strength above, below, Now like a mighty wind of woe, Around the island swept. And in that sound, it seemed, was bound All life's despair of art; The bitterness of joy that died; The anguish of faiths crucified; And love that broke its heart. The ghost it seemed of all we'd dreamed, Of all we had desired; Thatâturned a curse, an empty cryâ With wailing words went trailing by In hope's dead robes attired. And could this be the land that we Had sought for soon and late? That Island of the Blest, the fair, Where we had hoped to ease our care And end the fight with fate. O lie that lured! O pain endured! O toil and tears and thirst! Where we had looked for blessÃ©d ground The Island of the Damned we found, And in the endâwere curst! THE WATCHER Young was the dream that held her when The world was moon-white with the May: She watched the singing fishermen Sail out to sea at break of day: Soft, as the morning heavens then, The eyes that watched him sail away. Old was her grief when summer filled The world with warm maturity: Far off she watched the nets that spilled Their twinkling foison by the sea: Where on the rocks she sat and stilled With song his infant on her knee. Who to her love would make them liesâ Those vows his sea-slain manhood swore? Beneath the raining autumn skies The fishing vessels put to shore: She watches with remembering eyes For the brown face that comes no more. AT THE SIGN OF THE SKULL It's âGallop and go!â and âSlow, now, slow!â With every man in this life belowâ But the things of the world are a fleeting show. The post-chaise Time that all must take Is old with clay and dust; Two horses strain its rusty brake Named Pleasure and Disgust. Our baggage totters on its roof, Of Vanity and Care, As Hope, the post-boy, spurs each hoof, Or heavy-eyed Despair. And now a comrade with us rides, Love, haply, or Remorse; And that dim traveler besides, Gaunt Memory on a horse. And be we king or be we kern Who ride the roads of Sin, No matter how the roads may turn They lead us to that Inn: Unto that Inn within that land Of silence and of gloom, Whose ghastly Landlord takes our hand And leads us to our room. It's âGallop and go!â and âSlow, now, slow!â With every man in this life belowâ But the things of the world are a fleeting show. DUM VIVIMUS I Now with the marriage of the lip and beaker Let Joy be born! and in the rosy shine, The slanting starlight of the lifted liquor, Let Care, the hag, go drown! No more repine At all life's ills! Come, bury them in wine! Room for great guests! Yea, let us usher in Philosophies of old Anacreon And Omar, that, from dawn to glorious dawn, Shall lesson us in love and song and sin. II Some lives need less than others.âWho can ever Say truly âThou art mine,â of Happiness? Death comes to all. And one, to-day, is never Sure of to-morrow, that may ban or bless; And what's beyond is but a shadowy guess. âAll, all is vanity,â the preacher sighs; And in this world what has more right than Wrong? Come! let us hush remembrance with a song, And learn with folly to be glad and wise. III There was a poet of the East named HÃ¢fiz, Who sang of wine and beauty. Let us go Praising them, too. And where good wine to quaff is And maids to kiss, doff life's gray garb of woe; For soon that tavern's reached, that inn, you know, Where wine and love are not; where, sans disguise, Each one must lie in his strait bed apart, The thorn of sleep deep-driven in his heart, And dust and darkness in his mouth and eyes. FAILURE There are some souls Whose lot it is to set their hearts on goals That adverse Fate controls. While others win With little labor through life's dust and din, And lord-like enter in Immortal gates; And, of Success the high-born intimates, Inherit Fame's estates. . . . Why is't the lot Of merit oft to struggle and yet not Attain? to toilâfor what? Simply to know The disappointment, the despair, and woe Of effort here below? Ambitious still to reach Those lofty peaks, which men, aspiring, preach, For which their souls beseech: Those heights that swell Remote, removed, and unattainable, Pinnacle on pinnacle: Still yearning to attain Their far repose, above life's stress and strain, But all in vain, in vain! . . . Why hath God put Great longings in some souls and straightway shut All doors of their clay hut? The clay accurst That holds achievement back; from which, immersed, The spirit may not burst. Were it, at least; Not better to have sat at Circe's feast, If afterwards a beast? Than aye to bleed, To strain and strive, to toil in thought and deed, And nevermore succeed? THE CUP OF JOY Let us mix a cup of Joy That the wretched may employ, Whom the Fates have made their toy. Who have given brain and heart To the thankless world of Art, And from Fame have won no part. Who have labored long at thought; Starved and toiled and all for naught; Sought and found not what they sought. Let our goblet be the skull Of a fool; made beautiful With a gold nor base nor dull: Gold of madcap fancies, once It contained, that,âsage or dunce,â Each can read whoever runs. First we pour the liquid light Of our dreams in; then the bright Beauty that makes day of night. Let this be the must wherefrom, In due time, the mettlesome Care-destroying drink shall come. Folly next: with which mix in Laughter of a child of sin, And the red of mouth and chin. These shall give the tang thereto, Effervescence and rich hue Which to all good wine are due. Then into our cup we press One wild kiss of wantonness, And a glance that says not less. Sparkles both that give a fine Lustre to the drink divine, Necessary to good wine. Lastly in the goblet goes Sweet a love-song, then a rose Warmed upon her breast's repose. These bouquet our drink.âNow measure With your arm the waist you treasureâ Lift the cup and drink to Pleasure. LA JEUNESSE ET LA MORT I Unto her fragrant face and hair,â As some wild-bee unto a rose, That blooms in splendid beauty there Within the South,âmy longing goes: My longing, that is overfain To call her mine, but all in vain; Since jealous Death, as each one knows, Is guardian of La belle HelÃ©ne; Of her whose face is very fairâ To my despair, Ah, belle HelÃ©ne. II The sweetness of her face suggests The sensuous scented Jacqueminots; Magnolia blooms her throat and breasts; Her hands, long lilies in repose: Fair flowers all without a stain, That grow for Death to pluck again, Within that garden's radiant close. The body of La belle HelÃ©ne; The garden glad that she suggests,â That Death invests, Ah, belle HelÃ©ne. III God had been kinder to me,âwhen He dipped His hands in fires and snows And made you like a flower to ken, A flower that in Earth's garden grows,â Had He, for pleasure or for pain, Instead of Death in that domain, Made Love the gardener to that rose, Your loveliness, O belle HelÃ©ne! God had been kinder to me thenâ Me of all men, Ah, belle HelÃ©ne. LOVE AND LOSS Loss molds our lives in many ways, And fills our souls with guesses; Upon our hearts sad hands it lays Like some grave priest that blesses. Far better than the love we win, That earthly passions leaven, Is love we lose, that knows no sin, That points the path to Heaven. Love, whose soft shadow brightens Earth, Through whom our dreams are nearest; And loss, through whom we see the worth Of all that we held dearest. Not joy it is, but misery That chastens us, and sorrow;â Perhaps to make us all that we Expect beyond To-morrow. Within that life where time and fate Are not; that knows no seeming: That world to which Death keeps the gate Where Love and Loss sit dreaming. THE END OF ALL I I do not love you now, O narrow heart, that had no heights but pride! You, whom mine fed; to whom yours still denied Food when mine hungered; and of which love diedâ I do not love you now. II I do not love you now, O shallow soul, with depths but to deceive! You, whom mine watered; to whom yours did give No drop to drink to help my love to liveâ I do not love you now. III I do not love you now! But did I love you in the old, old way, And knew you loved meâ'though the words should slay Me and your love forever, I would say, âI do not love you now! I do not love you now!â A ROSE O' THE HILLS The hills look down on wood and stream On orchard-land and farm; And o'er the hills the azure-gray Of heaven bends the livelong day, And all the winds blow warm. On wood and stream the hills look down, On farm and orchard-land; And o'er the hills she came to me Through wildrose-brake and blackberry, The hill-winds hand in hand. The hills look down on home and field, On wood and winding stream; And o'er the hills she came along, Upon her lips a wildwood song, And in her eyes a dream. On home and field the hills look down, On stream and hill-locked wood; And breast-deep, with disordered hair, Fair in the wildrose tangle there, A sudden while she stood. O hills, that look on rock and road, On grove and harvest-field, To whom God giveth rest and peace, And slumber, that is kin to these, And visions unrevealed! O hills, that look on road and rock, On field and fruited grove, No more shall I find peace and rest In you, since entered in my breast God's sweet unrest of love! THE WHITE VIGIL I Last night I dreamed I saw you lying dead, And by your sheeted form stood all alone: Frail as a flower you lay upon your bed, And on your face, through the wide casement, shone The moonlight, pale as I, who kissed you there, So young and fair, white violets in your hair. Oh, sick with suffering was my soul; and sad To breaking was my heart that would not break; And for my soul's great grief no tear I had, No lamentation for my heart's deep ache; Yet what I bore seemed more than I could bear, Beside you there, white violets in your hair. A white rose, blooming at the window-bar, And, glimmering in it, like a firefly caught Upon the thorns, the light of one white star, Looked in on you, as if they felt and thought, As did my heart,ââHow beautiful and fair And young she lies, white violets in her hair!â And so we looked upon you, white and still, The star, the rose, and I. The moon had past, Like a pale traveler, behind the hill With all her sorrowful silver. And at last Darkness and tears and you, who did not care, Lying so still, white violets in your hair. A STUDY IN GRAY [I] A woman, fair to look upon, Where waters whiten with the moon; Around whom, glimmering o'er the lawn, The white moths swoon. A mouth of music; eyes of love; And hands of blended snow and scent, That touch the pearly shadow of An instrument. And low and sweet that song of sleep After the song of love is hushed; While all the longing, here, to weep, Is held and crushed. Then leafy silence, that is musk With breath of the magnolia tree, While dwindles, moth-white, through the dusk Her drapery. Let me remember how a heart Wrote its romance upon that night!â God help my soul to read each part Of it aright! And like a dead leaf shut between A book's dull chapters, stained and dark, That page, with immemorial green, Of life I mark. II It is not well for me to hear That song's appealing melody: The pain of loss comes all too near, Through it, to me. The loss of her whose love looks through The mist death's hand hath hung betweenâ Within the shadow of the yew Her grave is green. Ah, dream that vanished long ago! Oh, anguish of remembered tears! And shadow of unlifted woe Athwart the years! That haunt the sad rooms of my days, As keepsakes of unperished love, Where pale the memory of her face Hangs, framed above. This olden song of love and sleep, She used to sing, is now a spell That opens doors within the deep Of my heart's hell, In music making visible One soul-assertive memory, That steals unto my side to tell My loss to me. AT VESPERS High up in the organ-story A girl stands, slim and fair; And touched with the casement's glory Gleams out her radiant hair. The young priest kneels at the altar, Then lifts the Host above; And the psalm intoned from the psalter Is pure with patient love. A sweet bell chimes; and a censer Swings, gleaming, in the gloom; The candles glimmer and denser Rolls up the pale perfume. Then high in the organ choir A voice of crystal soars, Of patience and soul's desire, That suffers and adores. And out of the altar's dimness An answering voice doth swell, Of passion that cries from the grimness And anguish of its own hell. High up in the organ-story One kneels with a girlish grace; And, touched with the vesper glory, Lifts her madonna face. One stands at the cloudy altar, A form bowed down and thin; The text of the psalm in the psalter He chants is sorrow and sin.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Volume V Poems of Meditation and of Forest and Field TO GERTRUDE You are weary of reading: I am weary of song: The one is misleading; The other, o'er long:â All Art 's overlong. Ah, would it were ours To leave them, and then, 'Mid the fields and the flowers, Be children again, Glad children again. [POEMS OF MEDITATION] INTIMATIONS OF THE BEAUTIFUL A thought, to lift me up to those Sweet wildflowers of the pensive woods; The lofty, lowly attitudes Of bluet and of bramble-rose: To lift me where my mind may reach The lessons which their beauties teach. A dream, to lead my spirit on With sounds of fairy shawms and flutes, And all mysterious attributes Of skies of dusk and skies of dawn: To lead me, like the wandering brooks, Past all the knowledge of the books. A song, to make my heart a guest Of happiness whose soul is love; One with the life that knoweth of But song that turneth toil to rest: To make me cousin to the birds, Whose music needs not wisdom's words. I Shall I forget, and yet behold How Earth hath said its secret,âto The violet's appealing blue,â Of fragrance; old as Earth is old, The knowledge that is never told? Shall I behold and yet forget, The soft blue of the heaven fell, Between the dusk and dawn, to tell Its purpose, to the violet, Of beauty none hath fathomed yet? Between the Earth and Heav'n, above, The wind goes singing all day long; And he who listens to its song May catch an instant's meaning of The end of life, the end of love. II The gods of Greece are mine once more! The old philosophies again! For I have drunk the hellebore Of dreams, and dreams have made me saneâ The wine of dreams! that doth unfold My other self,â'mid shadowy shrines Of myths which marble held of old, Part of the Age of Bronze or Gold,â That lives, a pagan, 'mid the pines. Dead myths, to whom such dreams belong! O beautiful philosophies Of Nature! crystallized in song And marble, peopling lost seas, Lost forests and the star-lost vast, Grant me the childlike faith that clung.â Through loveliness that could not last,â To Heaven in the pagan past, Calling for God with infant tongue! III Idea, god of Plato! one With beauty, justice, truth and love: Who, type by type, the world begun From an ideal world above! Reason, who into Nature wrought Your real entities,âwhich are Ideas,âgiving to our star Their beauty through reflected thought; The reminiscences that flame, Momental, through the mind of man, Of things his memory can not name, Lost things his knowledge can not scan,â Hints of past periods are not these, His soul hath lived since it had birth In God?âYea! who shall say that Earth More ancient is than he who sees? IV Beside us, and yet far above, She leads us to no base renownâ The Ideal, with her sun-white crown, And starry raiment of her love: She leads us by ascending ways Of Nature to her purposed ends, Who in the difficult, dark days Of trial with her smile defends. Beyond the years, that blindly grope, To climb with her, from year to year, To some exalted atmosphere, Were more than earthly joy or hope! Though in that atmosphere we find Not herâher influence, pointing to New elevations of the mind By some superior avenue. V The climbing-cricket in the dusk Moves wings of moony gossamer; Its vague, vibrating note I hear Among the boughs of dew and musk, Whence, rustling with a mellow thud, The ripe quince falls. Low, deep and clear, The west is bound with burning blood. The slanting bats beneath the moon,â A dark disk edge with glittering white,â Spin loops of intertangled night: An owl wakes, hooting over soon, Within the forest far away: And now the heav'n fills, light by light, And all the blood-red west grows gray. I hear no sound of wind or wave; No sob or song, except the slow Leaf-cricket's flute-soft tremolo, Among wet walks grown gray and grave.â In raiment mists of silver sear, With strange, pale eyes thou comest, O Thou Spirit of the Waning-Year! VI The hills are full of prophecies And ancient voices of the dead; Of hidden shapes that no man sees, Pale, visionary presences, That speak the things no tongue hath said, No mind hath thought, no eye hath read. The streams are full of oracles, And momentary whisperings; An immaterial beauty swells Its breezy silver o'er the shells With wordless speech that sings and sings The real life of unreal things. No indeterminable thought is theirs, The stars', the sunsets' and the flowers'; Whose inexpressible speech declares Th' immortal Beautiful, who shares This mortal riddle which is ours, Beyond the forward-flying hours. VII The hornet stings the garnet grape, Whose hull splits with the honeyed heat;â Fall hears the long loud locust beat Its song out, where, a girl-like shape, She watches, through the wine-press' crust, Sweet trickle of the purple must. The bee clings to the scarlet peach, That thrusts a downy cheek between The leaves of golden gray and green;â Fall walks where orchard branches reach Abundance to her hands, or drop Their ripeness down to make her stop. The bitter-sweet and sassafras Hang yellow pods and crimson-black Along the rails, that ramble back Among the corn where she must pass; Where, on her hair, a golden haze, Showers the pollen of the maize. Not till 'mid sad, chill scents all day The green leaf-cricket chirrs its tune, And underneath the hunter's-moon The oxen plod through clinging clay, Or when, beyond the dripping pane, The night sets in with whirling rain: Not till ripe walnuts rain their spice Of frost-nipped nuts down, and the oak Pelts with brown acorns, stroke on stroke, The creek that slides through hints of ice; And in the lane the wagon pulls, Crunching, through thick-strewn hickory hulls: Not till through frosty fogs, which hold Wet mornings with their phantom night, Like torches glimmering through the white, The woods burn crimson blurs and gold, And through the mist come muffled sounds Of hunting-horns and baying hounds: Shall I on hills, where looming pines Against vermilion sunsets standâ Black ruins in a blood-red landâ In wrecks of sumac and wild vines, Go seek her, where she lies asleep, Her dark, sad eyes too tired to weep. VIII It holds and beckons in the streams; It lures and touches us in all The flowers of the golden fallâ The mystic essence of our dreams: A nymph blows bubbling music where Faint water ripples down the rocks; A faun goes dancing hoiden locks, And piping a Pandean air, Through trees the instant wind shakes bare. Our dreams are never otherwise Than real when they hold us so; We in some future life shall know Them parts of it and recognize Them as ideal substance, whence The actual isâ(as flowers and trees, From color sources no one sees, Draw dyes, the substance of a sense)â Material with intelligence. IX Once more I watch the hills take fire With dawn; and, shaggy spine by spine, Flush like dark tyrants o'er their wine, Who grasp the sword and break the lyre, And carve the world to their desire; While, red as blocks where kingdoms bleed, The rocks trail crimson vine and weed. To walls of gold, Enchantment built, Again my fancy bids me goâ Through woods, bewitched with fire, where blow Wild horns of tournament and tiltâ A fairy-prince, whose spear hath spilt No blood but in a shadow-world, While at the real his gage is hurled. What far, Ã¦olian echoes lead My longing?âas a voice might wake A lost child from deep sleep and take, With music of a magic reed, Him home where love will give him heed:â What echoes, blown from lands that lie Melodious 'neath no mortal sky? X The fire, to which the Magi prayed, The Aztecs sacrificed and kneeled, Whose ceremonies now are sealed, Whose priests are dust, whose people weighed, Since God permitted such, should man,â All ignorant of heavenly ends,â Despise the means, since Earth began, God works by to perfect His plan, Which through immediate forms ascends Of Nature, lifting, race by race, Man to the beauty of His face? Through Nature only we arrive At God: identical with truth, By periods of repeated youth, Through Nature must the Ages strive; The Epochs, that must purify Themselves through her experience, Her knowledge, which each Age lays by To clothe it better for the sky In robes of new intelligence Befitting life, that upwardly Approaches ends which none can see. XI Within the world awake behold A world asleep . . . the wildwood shades! With limbs of glimmering coolness lolled Along the purple forest glades:â Sleep in each unremembering face, The sea-worn Greeks knew these of old, And named âthe lotus-eating race.â Within the life asleep I mark A life awake; a life intense, That spurs the sap beneath the bark With tender hints of violence, The liquid germs of leaf and bud, And in the ponderable dark Fulfils the offices of blood. O wiser than Thy works!âbehind Thy works,âwho shall behold Thy place? Beyond the suns whose beams burn blind Before the glory of Thy face!â Among the least of worlds, shall we Presume to give to Thee, defined, A place and personality! XII Across the hills, that roll and rise Beneath the blue, adoring skies, Maturing Beauty by the old, Dark forest stands, as might a slave Before a Sultan sitting grave, Grim-gazing from a throne of gold. Across the hills, that rise and fall, I gaze with eyes grown spiritual, And see the Spirit of the Dew From out the morn, that stains the mist With amber and with amethyst, Blown, bubble-bright, along the blue. What king such kingly pomp can show As on the hills the afterglow? Where 'mid red woods the maples sit, Like scarlet-mantled sagamores, Who, from their totemed wigwam doors, Watch, through red fires, the ghost-dance flit. At night, as comes the fox, shall come The Spirit of the Frost, whose thumb Shall squeeze the chestnut burs, and press Each husk bare; whisper every flower Such tales of death that in an hour It dies of utter happiness. Until the moon sets I shall walk, And listen how the woodlands talk Of bygone lovely nights and days: My soul, made silent intimate Of all their sorrow, soon and late A portion of the autumn haze. XIII What revelations fill with song The cycles? and to what belong Life's far convictions of the light? Through which the spirit waxeth strong, The darkling soul surmounts the night, By builded rainbows, to some height Near mountain stars of Truth and Right, Beyond the vulture-wing of Wrong?â To Nature! who adjusts the deeps Of her soul's needs to man's; and keeps Such grave response as grief shall hear When on her heart it sinks and weeps; For every gladness, clean and clear Its glad reflection lying nearâ The wild accord of hope and fear Which in her inmost bosom sleeps. XIV The mallow, like an Elfland moon, Along the stream gleams grottoed gold; Its bell-shaped blossom seems to hold All the lost beauty of last June. September's mist haunts, white and cold, The windings of the forest stream, As death might haunt a thought or dream. And who with idle words hath stood, With idle thoughts, and gazed into The face of one he loved and knew, Dying in all her womanhood? No words, but silence, then will do, No thoughts but help the heart to hear: So seems it with the fading year. XV The snowy flutter of a hand Seems beckoning in the morning mist, And from the mist a jewelled wrist Of dew now waves us a command: And in the skies, behold! the Land Of Far-away-beyond-the-dawn, Where, crowned with roses wild and wan, The Futures of the World speed on. Along the eve a fiery arm Now points us to the waning west, And all the sorrow, that oppressed Our hearts once, straight becomes a charm Of beauty, whose dim spells transform The Present to the Long-ago, All grief to joy,âor seeming so,â We see through thaumaturgic glow. XVI Pearl-lilac blent with pearly rose, The dawn bloomed slowly out of dusk,â As some huge cactus from its husk Bursts vast a bloom whose chalice glows A grotto of transmuted dyes;â Such wild, auroral light as flows On ice-peaks from unearthly skies. Dove-purple shifting into shades Of opal,âlike the tints which dwell With fire in the ocean-shell,â The sunset flashed above the glades Through skies of nacre and of flame;â Such supernatural light as braids Dim coral caves, that have no name. XVII Draw from thine eyes the veil that hides Ideal visions; beckonings Of loveliness, whose soul abides Beneath the commonplace of things: No brook within the woodland then But shows its sparkling god to thee; Upon the ancient hills no tree Whose whispering spirit thou shalt not see, Fairer than children born of men. Refine thy flesh that never hears The inner music of all things,â The deaf flesh,âfrom thy spirit's ears, And list the vaster voice that sings With pregnant lips unto the Earth: Mornings, who hymn with gold the sky, To which the eves with gold replyâ The everlasting heavens that cry The visible psalms of death and birth. XVIII The flowers of the fall I seek: The purple aster,âlike a gauze Of pearl,âbeneath the nodding haws Or making gay each tangled creek: The hairy, small herb-Robert, lost,â Yet seen,âamong the weeds which crush Or crowd it, with its bluish blush; Its rough, low stalk stung red with frost. Around the rail-fence, climbing up, The nightshade hangs rich berries down,â Clusters of cochineal,âthat drown The flowering bind-weed's pendant cup: And where the boggy bottom sets Its burs as breastworks and as tents, Like bivouacking regiments, The cat-tails stack their bayonets. From amaranthâin tree and flowerâ To asphodelâin weed and bloomâ The season swings a magic loom Of sun and mist from hour to hour: In its wide warp it weaves the dyes Of morning's brilliant blue and gray; And crimson through the weft of day Flings the wild woof of evening skies. XIX What intimations made them wise, The mournful pine, the mighty beech? Some strange and esoteric speechâ (Communicated from the skies In secret whispers)âthat invokes The boles that sleep within the seeds, And out of narrow darkness leads The vast assemblies of the oaks. Within his knowledge, what one reads The poems written by the flowers? The sermons, past all speech that 's ours, Preached in the gospel of the weeds?â O eloquence of coloring! O thoughts of syllabled perfume! O beauty uttered into bloom! Teach me your dreams so I may sing! XX What time the great lobelia fills The wildwood with the blue of springâ And asters, scattered o'er the hills, Bloom, starry-sown, through everythingâ My fancy takes me wandering, My fancy, clothed in daffodils. In lavender lights, which sleep among The ferns, my heart is at a loss To find the love that leads along Down magic ways of tufted mossâ Now, like the brook, it calls across, Now, like a bird, it lures with song. It leads me to the land which lies Within a world no man can see; Wherein the Elfland cities rise, Faint haunts of musk and melody; That with the butterfly and bee And congregated flowers are wise. XXI Upon the Earth what hints are rife, Of life when change hath left us still! When death within us doth fulfil Its end, whose part is one with life! What hints, which tell us not alone Immortal is the spirit, for Flesh too,âcorruption can but mar,â The incorruptible puts on. The blood but fills a part that 's higher Of color, and pervades all flowers; The brain informs the twinkling hours With dreams of resurrected fire; The heart performs the function of A fragrance; and the countenance Lends new expression to, perchance, The face of beauty that we love. XXII Oh, joy, to walk the way that goes Through woods of sweet-gum and of beech! Where, like a ruby left in reach, The berry of the dogwood glows: Or where the bristling hillsides mass, 'Twixt belts of tawny sassafras, Brown shocks of corn in wigwam rows! Where, in the hazy morning, runs The stony branch that pools and drips, The red-haws and the wild-rose hips Are strewn like pebbles; and the sun's Own gold seems captured by the weeds; To see, through scintillating seeds, The hunters steal with glimmering guns! Oh, joy, to go the path which lies Through woodlands where the trees are tall! Beneath the misty moon of fall, Whose ghostly girdle prophesies A morn wind-swept and gray with rain; When, o'er the lonely, leafy lane, The night-hawk, like a dead leaf, flies! To stand within the dewy ring Where pale death smites the boneset blooms, And everlasting's flowers, and plumes Of mint, with aromatic wing! And hear the creek,âwhose sobbing seems A wild man murmuring in his dreams,â And insect violins that sing! Or where the dim persimmon-tree Rains on the path its frosty fruit, And in the oak the owl doth hoot, Beneath the moon and mist, to see The outcast Year come,âHagar-wise,â With far-off, melancholy eyes, And lips that thirst for sympathy! XXIII Along my mind flies suddenly A wildwood thought that will not die, That makes me brother to the bee, And cousin to the butterfly: A thought, such as gives perfume to The blushes of the bramble-rose, And, fixed in quivering crystal, glows A captive in the prismed dew. It leads the feet no certain way, No frequent path of human feet: Its wild eyes follow me all day, All day I hear its wild heart beat: And in the night it sings and sighs The songs the winds and waters love; Its wild heart lying tranced above, And tranced the wildness of its eyes. XXIV With eyes that seem to ache with tears I look beyond the twilight fields: The stars swing down their shimmering shields, And fill the phalanx of their spears. I can not see, I only know A flower dies beneath my feet; The fragrance of its death is sweet And bitter as my heart's own woe. With thoughts that find not what they seek I question Earth and Heaven, and find That they are dark and I am blind, And in my blindness very weak. I do not know, I only feel Behind all death a purpose stands, With hallowed and magnetic hands, Beneficent and strong to heal. XXV These, too, shall tell me what my heart, And what my soul desireth:â The flowers, that bloom serene for death, The stars, that know no mortal part. One shall inspire my heart with acts Of life so that the death responds; One to the soul breathe higher facts Of death that shall annul such bonds. Sufficient for my love these terms, Beyond my understanding's scope: I merely know all life must grope Not downward from its darkling germs. Sufficient for my faith is such: That, in the narrow night that binds The seed, its life shall feel in touch With light above it seeks and finds. XXVI Beyond the violet-colored hill The golden, deepening daffodil Of dusk bloomed on heav'n's window-sill: And, drifting west, the crescent moon Gleamed like a sword of Scanderoon A khedive dropped on floors of gold; Near which,âone loosened gem that rolled Out of the jewelled scimitar,â Glittered and shone the evening-star. Behind the trees, where, darkly deep As indigo, the shadows sleep,â As if the Titan world would heap A throne with purple for its god, Whose pomp comes with vermilion shodâ The west, 'thwart which the wild-ducks fly, Burns, richer than the orient dye PhÅnician vessels brought from Tyre, Deep, murex-stained, with carmine fire. The light dies down; the skies grow gray: The sear, dark forests sound and sway: The ashen rain-clouds roll this way. The green grig in the withered weeds Sings, and the wild snipe seeks the reeds. With hurling winds,âthat seem to wail Like Demon Huntsmen,âdark with hail And rain, which blot the cabin's light, Comes on the wild autumnal night. XXVII There is a rushing in the woods, The autumn-haunted solitudes, When night comes in with winds that sweep The wild rain from the hills; and reap The roaring harvest of the leaves With unseen scythes Death stalks behind, And Desolation, fierce and blind, Heaping the storm's tumultuous sheaves. There is a sighing in the woods, The hills of autumn solitudes, When on the night, the winds have strewn With crowding clouds, the stormy moon Bursts like a herald shouting Cease! Through darkness o'er a battlefield Of Hell; the splendor of his shield Inscribed with silence and with peace. XXVIII The storm,âthat makes the sky its own, And smites its spirit through Earth's nerves, And, like an instrument which serves High purposes to us unknown Of song that knows not that it sings,â Itself is all majestic things Imagination forms or feels; Itself all wonders it reveals To thought, which knows but semblances Of such concealed realities. The star, that flames through storm and crowds An instant with its utterance Of silence and serene romance, And glides again into the clouds, Shone for some present end; and filled A moment's need as Heaven willed:â A thought, some dreamer labored for, Immaculate as is a star; A hope, some weary watcher read Pale in the loved face of his dead. XXIX Towards evening, where the sweet-gum flung Its thorny balls among the weeds, And where the milkweed's sleepy seeds,â A fairy Feast of Lanterns,âswung; The cricket tuned a plaintive lyre, And o'er the hills the sunset hung A purple parchment scrawled with fire. From silver-blue to amethyst The shadows broadened in the vale; And, belt by belt, the pearly pale Aladdin fabric of the mist Stretched its vague exhalation far; A jewel on an Afrit's wrist, One star gemmed sunset's cinnabar. Then night drew near, as when, alone, The heart and soul grow intimate; And on the hills the twilight sate With shadows, whose wild robes were sown With dreams and whispersâdreams, that led The heart once with love's monotone, And whispers of the living dead. XXX Of life and of eternity These are the dreams that came to me: The one:âA whitened whirl of sea; A gallows beetling through the rains, And, tossing in its rusty chains, Carrion upon the gallows-tree: Gaunt ravens swarm above and tear Long strips from shrivelled skin and hair: A ship hurls pounding on the rocks: Wild minute-guns boom through the spume And crashing surf: out of the gloom The strangled dead leers down and mocks. An incorporeal solitude, Which darkness out of darkness hewed, The other dream: Enormous deeps Of naught, where ancient Silence sleeps, The eldest of Heav'n's Titan brood:â In unilluminated night, Vast and insufferable white, A summit soars: its light, which dyes Not darkness, of itself is born: Around its splendor, as in scorn, Night's dark, defiant chaos lies. XXXI Past midnight, gathering from the west, With rolling rain the storm came on, And tore and tossed until the dawn, Like some dark demon of unrest: The stairways creaked! the chimneys boomed; I heard the wild leaves blown about The windy windows; and the shout Of forests that the storm had doomed. I listened, and remembered how On yesterday I went alone A sunlit path through fields o'ergrown With sumac brakes, turned crimson now; Where asters strung blue pearls and white Beside the goldenrod's soft ruff; Where thistles, silvery puff on puff, Danced many a twinkling witch's-light. Her joy the Autumn uttered so To skies where gold and azure blent; Now storm is the embodiment Of all her utterance of woe: The two within me so abide, That of the two my mind partakes,â As one, who walks asleep, awakes, Walks on and thinks, âTo-night I died.â XXXII What sympathies of Heaven and Earth The human ego enters in! The universal stain of sin Which qualifies it from its birth, Denying it their highest worth. There is a parallel of kin 'Twixt earth and man, that dignifies Endeavor with such sympathies. The all mysterious wisdom waits In mountain, wood, and waterfall, Sky, rock and sea, to hear the call Of somethingâfirmer than the Fatesâ Deep in the soul it elevates; And to the splendor of the All Advances, through the night's immense, The spirit of experience. So think I now while, long and loud, The wind its maniac music beats, And storm a madman's song repeats To echoes in the rushing cloud; While all the world to wrath is vowed, And nothing conquers or defeats The darkness and the rain that raves Above the all-unheeding graves. XXXIII All night the rain-gusts shook the leaves Around my window; and the blast Rumbled the flickering flue, and fast The storm streamed from the dripping eaves. As ifâ'neath skies gone mad with fearâ The witches' Sabboth galloped past, The forests leapt like startled deer. All night I heard the sweeping sleet; And when the morning came, as slow As pale affliction, with the woe Of all the world dragged at her feet, No spear of purple shattered through The dark-gray of the east; no bow Of gold, whose arrows cleft the blue. But rain, that whipped the windows; filled The spouts with rushing; and around The garden stamped, and sowed the ground With limbs and leaves; the wood-pool filled With overgurgling.âBleak and cold The fields looked, where the foot-path wound Through teasel and bur-marigold. . . . Yet there is kindness in such days Of gloom, that doth console regret With sympathy of tears, which wet Old eyes that watch the back-log blazeâ A kindness, alien to the deep Glad blue of sunny days that let No thought in of the lives that weep. XXXIV This dawn, through which the Autumn glowers,â As might a face within our sleep, With stone-gray eyes that weep and weep, And wet brows bound with sodden flowers,â Is sunset to some sister land; A land of ruins and of palms; Rich sunset, crimson with long calms,â Whose burning belt low mountains bar,â That sees some brown Rebecca stand Beside a well the camel-band Winds down to 'neath the evening-star. O sunset, sister to this dawn! O dawn, whose face is turned away! Who gazest not upon this day, But back upon the day that 's gone! Enamored so of loveliness, The retrospect of what thou wast, Oh, to thyself the present trust! And as thy past make beautiful With hues, that never can grow less! Waiting thy pleasure to express New beauty, lest the world grow dull. XXXV At daybreak from the woodland come Echoes of hunting; or the chop Of some far woodman's axe, that cleaves The tingling oak, whose russet leaves Drop slowly where the white chips drop: The air is fragrant with the loam, Where, through the mists of steaming gold, The sudden sun strikes fold on fold. Out of the window, filmed with fog, I look into the wreck which was The kitchen-garden, drenched with rain; Among the death I mark again One blue convolvulusâthat draws A gray vignette along a log, With pencilled tendrils washed and wanâ The garden-story's colophon. XXXVI More storm than calm, less gold than gray, Along the years our lives must tread, Makes sad the scenes around our way, Makes grave the heavens overhead: For on life's storied page, behold, Are adumbrations of the dead! The neutral tint Time's fingers lay Around a tale that 's never told. Time writes with sunshine less than rain, With starlight less than mist, the scrollâ A thousand memories of pain To one of joyâof his own soul: The golden hues of life occur In his dim palimpsest, whose whole Death scrawls with dusty lines again, Making of all a leaden blur. XXXVII Down in the woods a sorcerer, Out of rank rain and death, distils,â Through chill alembics of the air,â Aromas that brood everywhere Among the dingles of the hills: The bitter myrrh of dead leaves fills Wet valleys (where the gaunt weeds bleach) With sodden scents of wood decay;â As if a spirit all the day Sat breathing softly 'neath the beech. With other eyes I see her flit, The wood-witch of the wild perfumes, Among her sleepy owls,âthat sit, A fluffy white, in crescent-lit Dim glens and opalescent glooms:â Where, for her magic, buds and blooms Mysterious perfumes, while she stands, A fragrant shadow, summoning The eery odors that take wing, Like bubbles, from her rainy hands. XXXVIII With leagues of fog, which showed the sun An agate-red without a ray, And drowned the world in ghostly gray, The chill, autumnal day begun: A phantom in the mist, a run Foamed over phantom ledges lone In forests that seemed far away, Wild woods of immaterial stone. With horses saffron to the knees A country cart drove through the fog; Its creaking wheels grown one great clog Of clay, and clanking swingletrees: Its smothered rumble did not cease Till hidden in the woodland mist, Where, leaning on his fresh-cut log, The muffled woodman blew his fist. Another world I wander in Of unlaid ghosts and dreams unfled; A twilight world of drowsy-head And mystery, built figment-thin Between the worlds of death and sin: Where dim and strange and incomplete, And substanceless, seem things not dead, And sorrowful as dimly sweet. XXXIX Among the woods they call to meâ The lights that haunt the strand and stream; Voices of such white ecstasy As moves with hushed lips through a dream: They stand in nimbused radiances, Or flash with glittering limbs across Their golden shadows on the moss, Or slip in silver through the trees. What love can give the heart in me More hope and exaltation than The hand of light that tips the tree And beckons far from marts of man? That reaches foamy fingers through The broken ripple, and replies With sparkling speech of lips and eyes To souls who seek and still pursue. XL Oh, bright the day, and calm and cool With clouds, like cotton-fields that swoon Beneath the silver summer moon; And, quiet as a forest pool,â Where Autumn sits and combs her locks, And strews with rainbow leaves and roon,â The shadows rest upon the rocks. The sun pours airy amber on The withered wood-ways, where the late Green-crickets' shell-like wings vibrate: And, fainter than lost lines of dawn, The fields shine labyrinthed with rays, With gossamer-webs, that imitate Cloud-figments, or a splintered haze. Beyond the yarrow's meekness now, Wood-sorrel's lowliness, and shy Hepatica's humility, The Year is grown: makes brave her brow With crowning crimson of the lands, And robes her limbs in cardinal dye, And by the lonely waters stands. XLI Pure thought-creations of the mind, Within the circle of the soul,â The emanations that control Life to its God-predestined goal,â Are spirit shapes no flesh can bind: Within the soul desire ordains Achievements which the will constrains; And far above us, on before, Our thoughtsâa beautiful peopleâsoar, To wait us on celestial plains. So Nature pours her thoughts in formsâ Realities we move amongâ Of fragrance, color, and of song; Sense emanations which belong, Invisible, to spiritual charms; The sensuous substance of her thought From immaterial matter wroughtâ Matter, which death can not annul, That constitutes the Beautiful, And, dead, repeats itself from naught. XLII Give me the streams, that counterfeit The twilight of autumnal skies; The silent, shadowy waters, lit With fire like a woman's eyes! Slow waters that, in autumn, glass The scarlet-strewn and golden grass, And drink the sunset's tawny dyes. Give me the pools, that lie among The centuried forests! give me those, Deep, dim, and sad as shadows hung Dark 'neath the sunset's sombre rose: Still pools, in whose vague mirrors lookâ Like ragged gipsies round a book Of magicâtrees in wild repose. No quiet thing, or innocent, Of water, earth, or air shall please My soul now: but the violent Between the sunset and the trees: The fierce, the splendid, and intense, Like love matures in innocence, Like mighty music, give me these! XLIII As Nature in herself resolves All parts of beauty to one whole, And from the perfect whole evolves The high ideas that control Advancement, till the time be ripe To doff disguise and, type by type, Reveal the emanated soul: So should the Beautiful in man Evolve the best in him; to be The lofty purpose life began For ends which only Heaven can seeâ The absolute, that sees how thought Its high ideal's shape hath wrought To be its far affinity. XLIV I hold them here; they are no less; I see them stillâthe changeful grays Of threatening skies above the hazeâ My hills! that roll long, murmuring miles Of savage-painted wilderness, On which the saddened sunlight smiles; Or, like a fallen angel's frownâ Severe beneath a burning crownâ Through sombre silvers, that oppress With clouds its glory, rushes down. I hear the coming storm again; Again behold the streaming clouds; The autumn wind drives down and crowds Wild sibylline voices through the leaves, To whispering octaves of the rain: A wilder wind, vibrating, heaves Vast music through the rolling woodsâ Upon my soul the grandeur broods, Like some archangel's trumpet strain, Or organ-pomp that sweeps all moods. XLV Such circumstance of passionate praise Hath no religion; and the creeds No pomp of worship or of grace Like Nature's, standing face to face With God, whose inmost thought she reads: No multitude of words she needs, Since all her worship is one word Of love, like that creation heard. God leaves progression in her care: Through her it must materializeâ Our Mother! with strong lips of prayer, Majestic-browed, with hands that bare Immortal fire from the skies: Who looks, with no evasive eyes, Through life, and, smiling, sees beneath The beautiful, dark eyes of death. XLVI Between the sunset and the stars Long clouds lieâas fierce sachems loom, In war-paint and the eagle-plume, Among their wampumed warriors, When council fires burn red and set On stoic cheeks the battle-bloom, That puff the smoking calumet. Beneath the stars and hunter's-moon The frost spreads ghostly pearls, that glance Like dewy jewels in the dance That whirls on fairied hills of June: The night is calm; no luminous veil Conceals the spirit utterance Of her dark beauty, pure and pale. XLVII I sat alone with song and sleep, And in the singing silence heard The darkness draw from forth the deep With star on star, like word on word: A sound of twilight and swift shades Materializing into night, Who hears the breaking waves of light, And towards the shores of morning wades. I sat alone with dawn and death, And in my waking vision saw The form of silence, like a breath Of bodiless beauty and of awe, Whose sibyl eyes said unto me The things the sealed lips would not word, That eons of the stars record In volumes of eternity. XLVIII The dead gold of the marybud, The dusky, tarnished orange-red Of zinnias, flush the flower-bed, Like frosty autumn gleams that scud Tempestuous dusks and stormy dawns Above the wind-dishevelled lawns. With tired eyes and heart grown grave, And thoughts more weary than the night, I watch the dwindling of the light, And hear the rising night-winds rave, As one might hear, when half asleep, Another self make moan and weep. XLIX Behold, the winds have speech and speak! The stars of heaven are eloquent! A voice within us bids us seek The word the flowers say in scent: The paraclete encouragement Of beauty that the burning scrolls Of eve and morning give our souls. There is one language of the mart; Another of the rocks and trees: Unrest and greed is this one's heart; The other's heart is rest and peace: Within our souls we know of these; They lead us by the myths we love, Yet never see and know not of. L When thorn-tree copses still were bare And black along the turbid brook; When catkined willows blurred and shook Great tawny tangles in the air; In bottomlands, the first thaw makes An oozy bog, beneath the trees, Prophetic of the spring that wakes, Sang the sonorous hylodes. Now that wild winds have stripped the thorn, And clogged with leaves the forest-creek; Now that the woods look brown and bleak, And webs are frosty white at morn; At night beneath the spectral sky, A far foreboding cry I hearâ The wild-fowl calling as they fly? Or vague voice of the dying Year? LI Night,âwho within heaven's uttermost Dark walls uncloses shadowy gates,â Beyond the Spirit of Light she hates, Speeds like a ghost before a ghost Upon the twilight-haunted coast Of death between the seas of sleep: Her lips are dumb with awe that hears; And in her eyes, that never weep, Is anguish of eternal tears. Out of the terrible gulfs of God Into God's awful deeps she goes, Revealing in heaven's gold and rose The ways her footsteps tread and trod From period to period: Her lips are stillâfor she hath heard God's voice that moves the universe: Her eyes are sad beyond the wordâ The eyes of Vastness gazed in hers. LII And still my soul holds phantom tryst, When chestnuts hiss among the coals, Upon the Evening of All Souls, When all the night is moon and mist, And all the world is mystery; I kiss dear lips that death hath kissed, And look in eyes no man may see, Filled with a love long lost to me. I hear the night-wind's ghostly glove Flutter the window: then the knob Of some dark door turn, with a sob As when love comes to gaze on love Who lies pale-coffined in a room: And then the iron gallop of The storm, who rides outside, his plume Sweeping the night with dread and gloom. So fancy takes my mind, and paints The darkness with eidolon light, And writes the deads' romance in white On the dim Evening of All Saints: Unheard the hissing nuts; the clink Of falling coals, whose shadow faints Around me where I sit and think, Borne far beyond the actual's brink. LIII No thing occult of Heaven or Earth, Or influence of such, I feel But hath a meaning and a worth God, in His wisdom, doth conceal: Reflections of another birth, Existent with and kin to ours, Announcing through supernal powers Facts of a world it would reveal. In Nature I perceive it, too, This other life I can not see: A spirit sparkles in the dew, The trees have tongues that speak to me: That Earth is green and Heaven, blue, The sight alone may satisfy; The soul sees with a different eye The meaning 'neath the mystery. LIV The shadow of uncertain things And all unearthly whisperings,â That premonitions death and blight,â Leans from the sepulchre of night; And on the Earth fall shadowings; And prophecies of near decay; But, lovelier than a dead delight, The starlit skies of glittering gray. Still shall the Season claim and keep Her wild-girl beauty; doubly deep The purport of her dreams shall rise Out of her heart into her eyes, Till very dreaming makes her weep; And death, with pale, pure lips and arms, Shall touch her from the frosty skies, Making a memory of her charms. LV Sometime shall Beauty hide no more The fair conceptions she conceives Beneath the abstract veil she weaves Before her face the few adore; The self-denying few, who long Live lofty lives of art and song, And, dying, leave the world less poor. No more are these alone when she, From the subjective world she rules, Confronts the falsehood of the schools With her high front of purity: And on the dark and general way Lets fall her individual ray That low as well as high may see. LVI The ghost of what was loveliness Sits in the waning woods, with bare And bleeding feet, and wintry hair, And brows the thorns of care distress; She makes a passion of despair And, Rachel-like, with eyes wept red, Refuses to be comforted. To funeral torches for the Year, Tree by tall tree, the forests turned; Then, fiery coals in ashes, burned A few last leaves among the sear; Where, robed in purple pomp, she yearned To die, like some sad queen, and died Crowned with magnificence and pride. LVII She meets us with impressive hands And eyes of earnest emphasis Between the known and unknown lands, And fills our souls with untold bliss, This spirit of the solitude Named Meditation; thought-imbued, On whom all beauty ministers; Whose silent, dreaming worshipers Lay unresisting hands in hers, Knowing their hearts are understood. The holy harp she holds and smites Was tuned among concordant spheres; The heavenly pen with which she writes Was dipped in angel smiles and tears: Between her eyebrows and her eyes The starry stamp of silence lies; Between her symboled lips and tongue, The song the stars of morning sung: To this her heavenly harp is strung, In that her holy pen is wise. LVIII Again the night is wild with rain; Again distracted with the gale: Upon the hills I hear a wail Of lamentation and of pain, As when, on some high burial-place, Moaning among the windy graves, The Indian squaws lament the braves, Who fell in battle for their race. Another day of storm shall dawn Within the east; and, darkly lit, Like one, with brows abstraction-knit, Absorbed in moody thought, pass on.â Bear not too hard, is all I ask, Upon the hearts that toil and yearn, O day of clouds! but swiftly turn To sunshine all your frowning mask. LIX No wind is this which cries forlorn Around the hilltops and the woods!â Earth, weary of her multitudes Of dead, despairing of the morn, Calls through illimitable night The wailing words no thing may know; Deep in her memory-haunted sight Sleeps no remembrance of delight, But death and everlasting woe. No wind! a voice whose sense is form; A form whose sense is but a sound; That smites the constant skies around, And shakes the steadfast hills with storm: Adown life's desolate deep it cries The words death's sterile lips must learn From Law, the Law that never diesâ Such utterless, wild speech as sighs In stone and cinerary urn. LX I heard the wind, before the morn Stretched gaunt, gray fingers 'thwart my pane, Drive clouds down, a dark dragon train; Its iron visor closed, a horn Of steel from out the north it wound.â No morn like yesterday's! whose mouth, A cool carnation, from the south Breathed through a golden reed the sound Of days that drop clear gold upon Cerulean silver floors of dawn. And all of yesterday is lost And swallowed in to-day's wild lightâ The birth deformed of day and night, The illegitimate, who cost Its mother secret tears and sighs; Unlovely since unloved; and chilled With sorrows and the shame that filled Its parents' love; which was not wise In passion as the night and day That yestermorn made heaven all ray. LXI We know not of one mood that 's hers, Or glad or grave, which has not drawn Its source from God's deep universe, As th' hours draw the day from dawnâ Nature's! who holds us quietly But earnestly, as by a spell, Whose contact with us seems to be Actual and yet intangible. In us she thus asserts her claims Of kinship and divine control; God-teacher of exalted aims, The high consents of heart and soul: Imperfectly man sees and feels, Through earthly mediums of his fate, The premonitions she reveals For issues that shall elevate. LXII Down through the dark, indignant trees, On indistinguishable wings Of storm, the wind of evening swings; Before its insane anger flees Distracted leaf and the shattered bough: There is a rushing, as when seas Of thunder beat an iron prow On reefs of wrath and roaring wreck: 'Mid stormy leaves, a hurrying speck Of flickering blackness, driven by, A mad bat whirls along the sky. Like some sad shadow, in the eve's Deep melancholyâvisible As by some strange and twilight spellâ A gaunt girl stands among the leaves, The night-wind in her dolorous dress: Symbolic of the life that grieves, Of toil that patience makes not less, Her load of faggots fallen there.â A wilder shadow sweeps the air, And she is gone: Was it the dumb Eidolon of the month to come? LXIII No songs but what are sorrowful And sweet in pensive notes and words, Shall fill my heart,âas singing birds Might build a nest within a skull. . . . The nun-like days, in stoles of white, Chant requiems for the dying Year: The monk-like nights about her bier, In cowls of black, with lights that blear, The service for the dead recite. Into my soul the litanies Of life and death strike golden bars: I hear the far, responding stars,â Uttering themselves within the skies,â Reverberate from cause to cause Results that terminate in man; From world to world, the rounding plan Of change,âGod's mighty artisan,â Of which both life and death are laws. LXIV No sunlight strews with gold the plain; No moonlight stains the hill with white; Clouds, sullen with the undropped rain, And motionless with unspent spite, Dome deep with uninvaded gray The dull, ignoble term of day, The duller period of night. Yea, ev'n the mad, marauding Wind, Who whipped his wild steeds east and west, Whose whirlwind wheels rolled down and dinned Along the booming forest's crest, Lies dead upon his mountains, where His sister Breezes beat the breast Sighing through their unshaken hair. LXV The griefs of Nature, like her joys, Are placid and yet passionate; These, in her heart which knows no hate, She for the beautiful employs. . . . Behold how thoughts of happiness Rainbow the tears on sorrow's face! Upon the brow of joy no less Aureates the light of seriousness! Each to the other lending grace. Oh, tenderness of grief that knows Some happiness still lies before! That for the rose that blooms no more Will bloom a no less perfect rose! Oh, pensiveness of joy that takes Sweet dignity from grief that died! Remembering that though morning shakes Her bright locks from blue eyes and wakes, Night sleeps on the same mountain side. LXVI What alchemy does Earth conceal Desired by the desperate days? With feet of fog and hands of haze They search the crumbling woods and steal With mutterings,âgaunt as hags who deal In witchcraft,âwhere each dark tree sways, And, venerable, with staff aslant, Death sits like some old mendicant. Around me all 's despondency, And grief that holds the unwilling world: The last gold leaf is wildly hurled Through sobbing silence over me: The brook has hushed its wildwood glee, Sick of itself; and far unfurled, And melancholy as my soul, The struggling lights of sunset roll. LXVII The song-birds, are they flown away, The song-birds of the summer-time, That sang their souls into the day, And set the laughing hours to rhyme? No catbird scatters through the hush The sparkling crystals of its song; Within the woods no hermit-thrush Trails an enchanted flute along, Thridding with vocal gold the hush. All day the crows fly cawing past: The acorns drop: the forests scowl: At night I hear the bitter blast Hoot with the hooting of the owl. The wild creeks freeze: the ways are strewn With leaves that clog: beneath the tree The bird, that set its toil to tune, And made a home for melody, Lies dead beneath the snow-white moon. THE MOATED GRANGE âThere, at the moated grange, resides this dejected Mariana.ââ Shakespeare. The sunset-crimson poppies are departed, Mariana! The purple-centered, sultry-smelling poppies, The drowsy-hearted, That burnt like flames along the low yew coppice; All heavy headed, The ruby-cupped and opium-brimming poppies, That slumber wedded, Mariana! The sunset-crimson poppies are departed. Oh, heavy, heavy are the hours that fall, The lonesome hours of the lonely days! No poppy strews oblivion by the wall, Where lone the last pod sways,â Oblivion that was hers of old that happier made her days. Oh, weary, weary is the sky o'er all, The days that creep, the hours that crawl, And weary all the waysâ She leans her face against the lichened wall, The mildewed wall, the crumbling wall, And dreams, the long, long days, Of one who will not come again whatever may befall. All night it blew. The rain streamed down And drowned the world in misty wet. At morning, round the sunflower's crown A row of silvery drops was set; The candytuft, heat shrivelled brown, And beds of drought-dried mignonette, Were beat to earth: but wearier, oh, The rain was than the sun's fierce glow, That in the garth had wrought such woe. That killed the moss-rose ere it bloomed, And scorched the double-hollyhocks; And bred great, poisonous weeds that doomed The snap-dragon and standing-phlox; 'Mid which gaunt spiders wove and loomed Their dusty webs 'twixt rows of box; And rotted into sleepy ooze The lilied moat, that, lined with yews, Lay scummed with many sickly hues. How oft she longed and prayed for rain, To blot the hateful landscape out! To heal her heart, so parched with pain, With cooling sounds of broken drought; And cure with change her stagnant brain, And soothe to sleep all care and doubt: At lastâwhen many days had passedâ And she had ceased to careâat last The longed-for rain came, falling fast. At night, as late she lay awake, And thought of him who had not come, She heard the gray wind, moaning, shake Her lattice; then the steady drum Of rain upon the leads. . . . The ache Within her heart, so burdensome, Grew heavier with the moan of rain. The house was still, save, at her pane, The wind cried: hushed: then cried again. All night she lay awake and wept: There was no other thing to do. At dawn she rose and, sighing, crept Adown the stairs that led into The dripping garth, the storm had swept With ruin; where, of every hue, The flowers lay rotting, stained with mould; Where all was old, unkempt and old, And ragged as a marigold. She sat her down, where oft she sat, Upon a bench of marble, where, In lines, she oft would marvel at, A love was carved.âShe did not dare Look on it then, remembering that Here in past time he kissed her hair, And murmured vows while, soft above, The full moon lit the form thereof, The slowly crumbling form of Love. She could but weep, remembering hours Like these. Then in the drizzling rain, That weighed the dead and dying flowers, She sought the old stone dial again; The dial, among the moss-rose bowers, Where often she had read, in vain, Of time and change, and love and loss, Rude-lettered and o'ergrown with moss, That slow the gnomon moved across. Remembering this, she turned away, The rain and tears upon her face. There was no thing to do or say.â She stood a while, a little space, And watched the rain bead, round and gray, Upon the cobweb's tattered lace, And tag the toadstool's spongy brim With points of mist; and, orbing, dim With fog the sunflower's ruined rim.â With fog, through which the moon at night Would glimmer like a spectre sail; Or, sullenly, a blur of light, Like some great glow-worm, dimly trail; 'Neath which she'd hear, wrapped deep in white, The far sea moaning on its shale: While in the garden, pacing slow, And listening to its surge and flow, She'd seem to hear her own heart's woe.â Now as the fog crept in from sea, A great white darkness, like a pall, The yews and huddled shrubbery, That dripped along the weedy wall, Turned phantoms; and as shadowy She too seemed, wandering 'mid it allâ A phantom, pale and sad and strange, And hopeless, doomed for aye to range About the melancholy grange. The pansies, too, are dead, the violet-varied, Mariana! The raven-dyed and fire-fretted pansies, To memory married; That from the grass, like forms in old romances, Raised fairy faces: All dead they lie, the violet-velvet pansies, In many places, Mariana! The pansies, too, are dead, the violet-varied. Oh, hateful, hateful are the hours that pass, The lonely hours of the lonesome nights! No pansy scatters heart's-ease through the grass, That autumn sorrow blights, The heart's-ease that was hers of old that happier made her nights. Oh, barren, barren is her life, alas! Its youth and beauty, all life has, And barren all delightsâ She lays her face against the withered grass, The rain-wet grass, the autumn grass, And thinks, the long, long nights, Of one who will not come again whatever comes to pass. CIRCE The pillared portals of her home once rose from out the sea; Its casements burnt with green sea-fire of ocean mystery; And all its halls of love were full of mermaid melody. Its battlements of beauty were a pharos from afar, To lure the wandering seamen like a constellated star:â Life may question: death is silent: will it answer where they are? It is enough to know that once between the golden goals Of dreams and deeds their vessel steered to music of citoles, And reached the Siren island where they pledged and lost their souls. It is enough to know that once love led them with a luteâ To taste the honey of her soul and of her flesh the fruit; Between the soul and flesh she changed each man into a brute. It is enough to know that love once sate them at a feastâ Her word was bread and oil to them, her kiss was wine at least; Between the word and kiss she changed each man into a beast. The marble now is vanished where the columned wonder rose; The billow beats complaining there, a heart of many woes; The sea-wind sings uncertain things of what the Siren knows. Ah me! you know not how it is with him who once has been A portion of such passion and the slave of such a queen; What such possession of her love to his whole life may mean! The world of languid attitudes that lured him to despair; Abandonments of beauty that his heart would not bewareâ A red rose suffering death to live one hour in her hair. Yea, just to be again to her as music to the lute, As fragrance to the senses, and to lips the blood-red fruit, Between the soul and flesh again, unto her beauty, brute. Her alabaster stairways and her casements filled with light, Her corridors of melody and colonnades of night Shall haunt his heart forever with the magic of her might! POPPY AND MANDRAGORA Let us go far from here! Here there is sadness in the early year: Here sorrow is where joy went laughing late: The sicklied face of heaven hangs like hate Above the woodland and the meadowland; And Spring hath taken fire in her hand Of frost and made a dead bloom of her face, Which was a flower of beauty once and grace, And musk and color and serenest glow. Delay not; let us go. Let us go far away Into the sunrise of a fairer day: Where all the nights resign them to the moon, And drug their souls with odor and soft tune, And tell their dreams in starlight: where the hours Teach immortality with fadeless flowers; And all the day the bee weighs down the bloom, And all the night the moth shakes strange perfume From bell and bugle of the lily intense. Let us go far from hence. Why should we sit and weep, And yearn with weary eyelids still to sleep? Forever hiding from our hearts the hate, Death within death, life doth accumulate, Like winter snows, along the barren leas And sterile hills, whereon no lover sees The crocus limn the beautiful in flame; Or hyacinth and jonquil write the name Of love in fire, beautiful to the eye. Why should we sit and sigh? We will not stay and long, Here where our souls are wasting for a song; Where no bird sings; and, dim beneath the stars, No silvery water strikes melodious bars; And in the rocks and forest-covered hills No quick-tongued echo from her grotto fills With eery syllables the solitudeâ The vocal image of the voice that wooedâ Echo, of sound the airy looking-glass. Our souls are sick, alas! What should we say to her, To Hope, who in our hearts makes no sweet stir? Who looks not on us nor gives thought unto: Too busy with the birth of bud and dew, And vague gold wings within the chrysalis; Or Love, who will not miss us; had no kiss To give your soul or the sad soul of me, Who gave our hearts to her in poesy, Long since, and wear her badge of service still. Yea, we have served our fill. We will go far away. Song will not care, who slays our souls each day With the dark daggers of indignant eyes, And lips' sharp silence! . . . Had she sighed us lies, Not passionate, yet falsely tremulous; And lent her mouth to ours, in mockery; thus Smiled from calm eyes a loveless negative; Then, then our hearts had taught themselves to live Feeding their love on her indifference. But no!âso let us hence. So be the Bible shut Of Love and Beauty, and their wisdom but A clasp of memory!âWe will not seek The light that came not when our souls were weak With longing, and the darkness gave no sign Of star-born comfort. Nay! why should we whine Dull psalms of patience, or hosannas of Old hope and dreary canticles of love?â Leave us alone. My soul hath long supposed For us God's book was closed. ROSEMARY I If she but breath her wild breath in my face, If she but shake her wild hair past mine eyes, When life sits tearless in grief's sunless chamber, Then through the vasts of separating space, Robed on with fire of hope my soul shall rise And claim her. II When shall this be?âNot till within my soul Joy's lips are dumb, and dumb his instrument, And love lies dead beside one withered flower, And dark the gray walls of the home of dole,â Whence the last flicker of hope's taper went,â Shall tower. III If she but bend her loving eyes on mine, If she but give one loving thought to me, When life sits sleepless in sleep's caverned hollow, Then in the night a sudden star shall shine, And I shall rise, robed on with ecstasy, And follow. IV When shall this be?âNot till within my heart Hope's voice is still, and song that suffereth, And love lies dead beside his silent numbers, And in the halls of silence, all apart, Oblivion sits, crowned with the crown of death, And slumbers. NIGHTSHADE I Though she hath lifted up my face to hers, And kissed the lips of worship she denied, There is no mouth of verse, Here in the shadow of the crucified, Or voice of love; only my soul that died, My dead soul and my curse!â She asks me now for flowers that are ashes, Here where the red flow'r of my life lies slain: For love, that lashed me once and now that lashes Her soul again. II Though she hath gazed into mine eyes and said, âBelovÃ©d, look thou in my soul and see,â And I have looked and read The burthen of a kindred agony, I am grown glad that this hath come to be Betwixt the quick and dead.â She asks me now for songs from love's sweet psalter, Here where the music of my life lies hushed: For love, that died upon the iron altar Where hers lies crushed. III Though she hath touched hot lips to mine and wept, From out the hell of her wild soul, fierce tears, Each little look love kept Of her disdain, unknowingly, these years, And word of scorn, is crier at mine ears To wake the hate that slept.â She asks me now for water that shall cherish, When hot sands choke my life's dry fountain-head: For love, that stirs not though her love should perish Where mine lies dead. LOTUS Where is the vale and mountain, And where the rock and stream, One with its life of music, The other with its gleam, Where she and I were shadows And all our world, a dream? Between the world of waking, And the sad world of sleep, I met her, crowned with sorrow Of love no heart would keep; Within her eyes the terror Of darkness, starry deep. And was it in the valley, Where something whispereth, âWho is it walks so dimly?â That I heard her murmur, âDeathâ? As if upon my eyelids The Beautiful breathed its breath. There was no tomb before us, Nor any stone to tell Of love, or hate, or horror In heaven or in hellâ But in her look the legend, And in her eyes the spell. And was it on the mountain, The stealthy stars had crossed To stand austere with silence, That I heard her whisper, âLostâ? As if dark eyes one moment The Terrible did accost. There was no memoried presence Of flower or star or bird To tell of tears and parting That heartbreak once had heardâ But in her face the vision, And in her heart the word. Where is the vale and mountain, And where the rock and stream, One with its life of music, The other with its gleam, Where she and I were shadows And all our world, a dream? MOLY When by the wall the tiger-flower swings A head of sultry slumber and aroma; And by the path, whereon the blown rose flings Its obsolete beauty, the long lilies foam a White place of perfume, like a beautiful breast; Between the pansy fire of the west, And poppy mist of moonrise in the east, This heartache will have ceased. The witchcraft of soft music and sweet sleepâ Let it beguile the burthen from my spirit, And white dreams reap me, as strong reapers reap The golden grain and gorgeous blossom near it; Let me behold how gladness gives the whole The transformed countenance of my own soul; Between the sunset and the risen moon, Let sorrow vanish soon. And these things then shall keep me company: The spirit of the dew; the heart of laughter That haunts the wind; the soul of melody That sings within the stream, that reaches after The flow'rs, that rock themselves to its caress: These of themselves shall shape my happiness, A visible presence I shall lean upon, Feeling that care is gone. Forgetting how the cankered flower must die; The worm-pierced fruit fall, sicklied to its syrup; How joy, begotten 'twixt a sigh and sigh, Waits with one foot forever in the stirrup:â Remembering how within the hollow lute Sweet music sleeps when music's voice is mute; And in the heart, when all seems dark despair, Hope with his golden hair. CHRYSELEPHANTINE I Among the hills and morning-colored ways Let us go forth, oh, let us go with singing! Within the hearts of better bosoms bringing A gift of gifts, one day of all our days, Unto the golden temple of God's praise, And ivory altar of the beautiful. The woods are deep, the woods are dark and cool; Let us go forth with timbrels of rejoicing, And lutes of love, and lips forever voicing The beautiful! II The milkworth's pink and barley's gold and green, Twined with the purple of the wilding pansies, Shall be our wreath;âsweet as an old romance is With pale blue eyes of some fair fairy-queen,â Let the frail bluet in our wreath be seen; And of mauve leaves and leafy loveliness, And cool, green moss and ferns shall be our dress. Let us go forth, arrayed as is the morning, With psalteries of praise, to the adorning Of loveliness! III No spotted serpent hisses near her shrine, That God ordained, within the heaven-lit distance, Which love hath built, with life to give assistance, Of fragrance and of song; whereover shine All of God's stars,âso many thoughts divine:â And at its entrance moonÃ©d purity, Naked, keeps guard,âno eye impure shall see!â But worshippers of beauty in the spirit, And offerers of soul, whose thoughts inherit Love's purity. SIBYLLINE I There is a glory in the apple-boughs Of glimmering moonlight,âlike a torch of myrrh, Burning upon an altar of sweet vows, Dropped from the hand of some pale worshiper:â And there is life among the apple-blooms Of mystic winds,âas if a god addressed The flamen from the sanctuary glooms, Revealing secrets which no man has guessed, Saying: âBehold! a darkness which illumes: A waking which is rest.â II There is a blackness in the apple-trees Of tempest,âlike the ashes of an urn Hurt hands have gathered upon blistered knees, With salt of tears, out of the flames that burn:â And there is death among the blooms, that fill The night with breathless scent,âas when, above The priest, the vision of his faith doth will Forth from his soul the beautiful form thereof, Saying: âBehold! a silence never still: And love that 's more than love.â ELEUSINIAN Praxitelean marbles, fairer forms Than Phryne's and than hers,âwho loved and knew The Attic cynic's soul,âthe rosy charms Of lovely LaÃ¯s, gradually grew Before his eyelids, like a floating mist, Out of the music of the citharist. And there were Dryads, laughing sidewise eyes, Among CithÃ¦ron's ash-trees; and uncouth Brown Satyrs, dancing 'neath BÅotian skies; And by a fountain sat a beautiful youth, Like some white flow'r, with dim, dejected grace, In love with the reflection of his face. And then a chord of soft bewitchment swept Along his soul; and, oh! within a vale, Like some young god, a godlike mortal slept; And there was splendor on the heights, and pale The presence of supernal purity, Whose face was as a marble melody. And now two chords, that were two hands that strewed Innumerable memories upon His eyelidsâand his spirit understood How, ages past, he was Endymion,â And, lo! again the old, wild rapture of Immortal sorrow and immortal love. ARGONAUT His argosy spreads dawn-kissed sails, His trireme oars the dusk, On mythic seas whereover gales Of summer breathe their musk. He hears the hail of Siren bands From headlands sunset-kissed; The Lotus-eaters wave him hands Pale in a land of mist. For many a league he hears the roar Of the Symplegades; And through the far foam of its shore The Isle of Circe sees. All day he looks with hazy lids At sea-gods cleave the deep; All night he hears the NereÃ¯ds Sing their wild hearts to sleep. When heaven thunders overhead, And hell upheaves the Vast, Dim faces of the ocean's dead Gaze at him from his mast. He but repeats the oracle That bade him first set sail; And cheers his soul with, âAll is well! Sail on! I will not fail!â Behold! he sails no earthly barque, And on no earthly seaâ Adown the years he sails the dark Deeps of futurity. Ideals are the ships of Greece His purpose steers afar: His seas, the skies, the Golden Fleece He seeks, the farthest star. SIC VOS NON VOBIS If on the thorns thy feet be pierced to-morrow, And far the fierce sands glare, Unbind thy temples! thank life for its sorrow, Its longing and despair. With love within, what heart shall halt and wither, Athirst for rivered hills? Moaning, âMine! mine! what hate hath led me hither Unto a sky that kills?â Unworthy thou! if faith should sink and falter; Blind hand and blinder eye Bind the blind hope upon thy doubt's old altar And stab it till it die. Thou canst not say thy toil and tears have never Communed with lovely sleep! Had night before thine eyeballsânight forever To lead thee to the deep! Ay! wouldst thou have thy self-love for a burden, A fardel bound with tears, To sweat beneath and gain at last, for guerdon, From hands of wasted years? To find thy stars are glow-worms, feebler, thinner Than glimmers of the moon: Dead stars, and all the darkness of the inner Self's deader plenilune. To see at last,âbeneath Death's sterner learning, âThrough sockets sealed with frost, The awful sunsets of Doom's heavens burning God's baffling pentecost. WITH THE TIDE Once when the morning flashed athwart the breakers, And on the foaming sand, In exultation, by the ocean's acres, Love took command. And so we sailed, Ã¦olian music melting Around our silken sails; The bubbled foam our prow of sandal pelting With rainbow gales. We watched the beach, with prickly cactus hateful, And gnarled palmetto, pass Beyond our vision; coasts where Life walked fateful With Time's slow glass. Though hateful now, who could forget the beauty Of dim and fragile shells, That strewed the shores of Patience and of Duty Like asphodels? The rocks of Care, where Faith's meek flow'r suffices To lead Love up and on, To levels, that the Bible's lily spices, Divine with dawn? On, on we sailed, Love laughing at to-morrow, Past sunny isle and cape: Three were we now:âMy Soul and Love andâSorrow, A tall, dim shape. On, on we sailed, Love at the golden rudder, On till the day waxed late, When, lo! beside him, like an icy shudder, Rose pallid Hate. On, on we sailed, Love seeing me, no other: None crowned with bleeding thorn, None armed with violence, and now anotherâ Unyielding Scorn. And then Love saw; Love, who had naught demanded, Love saw, and summoned Pride: The darker three, against the bright two banded, Stood side by side. On through the night our barque went drifting, drifting; My stricken Soul alone; A white face cold as moonlit marble lifting, And still as stone. APPORTIONMENT If grief must fill my heart with tears, and Time Abate no hour Of agony with any happy rhyme,â Be grief my dower. If days must sing to my attentive soul Joy's cradle-song, Nor lift one grave note in the gladsome whole, Let joy be long. Bring me pale flowers of the handselled hills, To braid and lay On coffined brows, sad separation fills With death's dismay. Or dreams to drug my soul's life-cup with pure Ideal love; Glad dreams of life whose beauties aye allure The soul above. A harp, to hold against my heart and smite With smiles and tears, To sing bereavement or my soul's delight Through all the years. Make of my heart a lute, for Love to wake With tripping tune; Or Loss to crush against her breast and break With wilder croon. Upon the mountains of the morning lands, Where all may look, Let Hope arise and lift with astral hands His starry book. Up bars of stars, the golden notes of skies, On night's black scroll Let the moon's music lift, and with it rise Despair's dark soul. Apportion, O my God, the hope or fear, The grief or glee! Thine be the purpose of each smile, each tear Eternally. ESOTERIC BEAUTY I Within the old, old forest The wind hath whispered me Thou dwellestâthou, who warrest With birds in melody, And all the wood-ways starrest With wild-flow'rs fragrantly, Thou presence none may see! II If I should find thee sitting Beneath the woodland tree, The elder-blossoms knitting In wreaths of witchery, Between the glimpse and flitting, What wouldst thou show to me, Thou presence none may see? III O thou, who, haply, hidest, A flower upon the tree; Or in a color glidest, Or murmur of a bee; Or in a scent abidest, A fragrance,âshow to me The things no man may see! IV If I should find thee dreaming Upon the wild-rose lea, The heart within thee gleaming And breathing like a bee, Between the real and seeming, What wouldst thou say to me, Thou presence none may see? V O thou, who, haply, tellest To birds their wildwood glee; Who in the water wellest As murmuring melody; And in the wood-wind dwellest As music,âsing to me Of that no man may see! TEMPEST The trees before the coming storm Toss, wild as leaping Corybants Who fling to Cybele an arm Of rapture, and a face that pants Through hair the ritual frenzy slants. Vague, stormy shapes of tempest sit, August, majestic, and immense, Beneath the starsâas, lightning-lit, A god might give wild audience To awe and night and violence. Storm is her signet; hers, who writes Stern laws in flame; and, shadowy, With thunder seals the rolled-out nights, And sits in terrible mysteryâ The mountain-crownÃ©d Cybele. REVELATION I write these things that men may hear. This was the word that gave me cheer: There sate a dÃ¦mon at mine ear, Who whispered me, âMan knoweth naught.â First know thyself wouldst thou know aught.â This was the word that brought me grace: There fell a shape before my face, Who motioned me, âAll forms are sin's.â He aims above himself who wins.â This was the word that made me wise: There stood an angel at mine eyes, Who looked, âThe world lives selfishly.â Give thy own self if thou wouldst see.â These are the words they brought to me. ANALOGIES Of Rosamond the beautiful, of her The joy and pride of Cunimund,âlast king Of the fierce GepidÃ¦,âa warrior Such as the old-world minstrels loved to sing, To Alboin, Prince of Lombardy,âat war With Cunimund her father,âfame did bring Report of such proud loveliness and grace That he had loved her ere he saw her face. War was between them and the hate of thrones: For he had slain a son of Turismund And brother of King Cunimund. His bones Were as a wall between desireâunsunned Of such encouragement as young Love owns; Young Love, before the ruined lips that stunned Appeal with dead defiance, and the grim Confrontment mocking as the hopes of him.â Such oft is Life! that, standing with despair, Looks on some crime,âas looked the conqueror Of Rosamond,âere goaded on to dare Fate through the stern arbitrament of war: Death smiles within the danger of her hair; Defeat, more deadly than the wild Avar, Looks, armored, from her eyes; and in her mouth An exarch marshals legions from the south. Yet, should he so prevail against her mightâ Her woman Pride, her hosts of beautiful Angers and scornsâthat she be forced, some night, To pledge him faith in Hate's full cup, a skullâ What though he sees Revenge writ, fiery white, Upon her brow! revenge, that hides a dull Poison for sleep, or dagger all prepared!â Life writes not Failure where Fate writes He dared. MNEMONICS It shall not be forgotten Of any one who sees,â The sorrel-flow'r amid the moss, The wind-flow'r 'mid the trees. Though I can but remember All flowers by her face, That flow'r, which is my life's perfume, Kin to the wild-flow'r race. It shall not be forgotten Of any one who looks,â The evening-star above the hills, Its image in the brooks. Though I can but remember All planets by her eyes, Those stars, which are my destiny, Bright sisters to the skies'. And, oh, the song that follows The wing-beat of the bird!â It shall not be forgotten When once such song is heard. Though I can but remember All music by her words, Her voice, which is my heart's response, Kin to the building bird's. How can they be forgotten, The fair and fugitive, When in all birds and stars and flowers Love's intimations live! ASSUMPTION I A mile of moonlight and the whispering wood: A mile of shadow and the odorous lane: One large, white star above the solitude, Like one sweet wish: and, laughter after pain, Wild roses wistful in a web of rain. II No star, no rose, to lesson him and lead, No woodsman compass of the skies and rocks,â Tattooed with stars and lichens,âdoth love need To guide him where, among the hollyhocks, A blur of moonlight, gleam his sweetheart's locks. III We name it beautyâthat permitted part, The love-elected apotheosis Of Nature, which the god within the heart, Just touching, makes immortal, but by thisâ A star, a rose, the memory of a kiss. PROEM TO âUNDERTONESâ Long are the days, and overlong the nights. The weary hours are a heavy chain Upon the feet of all Earth's dear delights, Holding them ever prisoners to pain. What shall beguile me to believe again In hope, that Faith within her parable writes Of life, Care reads with eyes whose teardrops stain? Shall such assist me to subdue the heights? Long is the night, and overlong the day.â The burden of all being!âIs it worse Or better, lo! that they who toil and pray May win no more than they who toil and curse? A little sleep, a little love, ah me! And the slow weight up the soul's Calvary! UNQUALIFIED Not his the part to win the goal, The flaming goal that flies before, Into whose course the apples roll Of self that stay the feet the more. Beyond himself he shall not win Whose aim is as a driven dust, That his own soul must wander in, Seeing no farther than his lust. UNENCOURAGED ASPIRATION Mine is the part of no companion hand Of help, except my shadow's silent self: A moonlight traveller in Fancy's land Of leering gnome and hollow-laughing elf: Whose forests deepen and whose moon goes down, When night's blind shadow shall usurp my own; And, 'midst the dust and wreck of some old town, The City of Dreams, I grope and fall alone. INTERPRETED What magic shall solve us the secret Of beauty that 's born for an hour? That gleams, in the flight of an egret, Or swoons, in the scent of a flower, With death for a dower? What leaps in the bosk but a satyr? What pipes in the wind but a faun? What blooms in the waters that scatter But limbs of a nymph that is gone, When we walk in the dawn? What sings on the hills but a fairy? Or sighs in the fields but a sprite? What breathes through the leaves but the airy Dim spirits of shadow and light, When we walk in the night? Behold how the world-heart is eager To draw us and hold us and claim! Through truths of the dreams that beleaguer Her soul she makes ours the same, And death but a name. SECOND SIGHT They lean their faces to me through Green windows of the woods; Their cool throats sweet with honey-dew Beneath their leafy hoodsâ No dream they dream but hath been true Here in the solitudes. Star trillium, in the underbrush, In whom Spring bares her face; Sun eglantine, that breathes the blush Of Summer's quiet grace; Moon mallow, in whom lives the hush Of Autumn's tragic pace. This one hath heard the dryad's sighs Behind the covering bark; That one hath felt the satyr's eyes Gleam through the bosky dark; And one hath seen the Naiad rise In waters all a-spark. I bend my soul unto them, stilled In worship man hath lost:â The old-world myths that science killed Are living things almost To me through these whose forms are filled With Beauty's pagan ghost. And with new eyes I seem to see The world these live within,â A shuttered world of mystery, Where unreal forms begin Real forms of ideality That have no unreal kin. SUCCESS How some succeed, who have least need, In that they make no effort for! And pluck, where others pluck a weed, The burning blossom of a star, Grown from no earthly seed. For some shall reap who never sow; And some shall toil and ne'er attainâ What boots it, in ourselves to know Such labor here is not in vain, When we still see it so! THE HOUSE OF SONG Unto the portal of the House of Song, Symbols of wrong and emblems of unrest, And mottoes of despair and envious jest, And stony masks of scorn and hate belong. Who enters here shall feel his soul denied All welcome; where the chiselled form of Love Stares down in marble on the shrine above The tomb of Beauty where he dreamed and died. Who enters here shall know no poppy flowers Of Rest, or harp-tones of serene Content; Only sad ghosts of music and of scent Shall mock his mind with their remembered powers. Here must he wait till striving Patience carves His name upon the century-storied floor; His heart's blood staining one dim pane the more In Fame's high casement while he sings and starves. FLOWERS Oh, why for us the blighted bloom, The blossom that lies withering!â Why has He, of Life's changeless loom, Created here no changeless thing? Where grows the rose of fadeless Grace? Through which the spirit manifests The fact of an immortal place, The dream on which religion rests. Where buds the lily of our Faith? That grows for us in unknown wise, Out of the barren dust of death, The pregnant bloom of Paradise. In Heaven! so near that flowers know! That flowers see how near!âand thus Reflect the knowledge here below Of love and life unknown to us. DEAD SEA FRUIT All things have power to hold us back. Our very hopes build up a wall Of doubt, whose shadow stretches black O'er all. The dreams, that helped us once, become Dread disappointments, that oppose Dead eyes to ours, and lips made dumb With woes. The thoughts that opened doors before Within the mind's house, hide away; Discouragement hath locked the door For aye. Come, loss, more frequently than gain! And failure than success! until The spirit's struggle to attain Is still! REQUIEM I No more for him, where hills look down, Shall Morning crown Her rainy brow with blossom bands!â The Morning Hours, whose rosy hands Drop wild-flowers of the breaking skies Upon the sod 'neath which he lies.â No more for him! No more! no more! II No more for him, where waters sleep, Shall Evening heap The long gold of the perfect days! The Eventide, whose warm hand lays Great poppies of the afterglow Upon the turf he rests below.â No more for him! No more! no more! III No more for him, where woodlands loom, Shall Midnight bloom The star-flow'red acres of the blue! The Midnight Hours, whose dim hands strew Dead leaves of darkness, hushed and deep, Upon the grave where he doth sleep.â No more for him! No more! no more! IV The hills, that Morning's footsteps wake; The waves that take A brightness from the Eve; the woods, The solitudes, o'er which Night broods, Their Spirits have, whose parts are one With his, whose mortal part is done. Whose part is done; alas! is done. AT LAST What shall be said to him, Now he is dead? Now that his eyes are dim, Low lies his head? What shall be said to him, Now he is dead? One thing, he knew not of, Sweet, in his ear Whisper with all thy loveâ Haply he'll hear. One thing, he knew not of, Sweet, in his ear. What shall be given him, Now he is dead? Now that his eyes are dim, Low lies his head? What shall be given him, Now he is dead? That which was long denied Here, Sweet,âthy heart Lay now his heart beside, Never to part. That which was long denied Here, Sweet,âthy heart. REMEMBERED Here in the dusk I picture it again, Her face, as 't was before she fell asleep: Renunciation glorifying pain Of her soul's inmost deep. I shall not see its like again! the brow Of marble, that the fair hair aureoled,â Like some pale lily in the afterglow,â With supernatural gold. As if a rose should speak and, somehow heard Thro' some strange sense, the unembodied sound Grow visible, her mouth was as a word A sweet thought falters round. So do I still remember eyes imbued With far reflectionsâas the stars suggest The silence, purity, and solitude Of infinite peace and rest. She was my all. I loved her as men love A high desire, religion, an idealâ The meaning purpose in the loss whereof God shall alone reveal. MONOCHROMES I The last rose falls, wrecked of the wind and rain; Where once it bloomed the thorns alone remain: Dead in the wet the slow rain strews the rose. The day was dim; now eve comes on again, Grave as a life weighed down with many woes: So is the joy dead, and alive the pain. The brown leaf flutters where the green leaf died; Bare are the boughs, and bleak the forest side: The wind is whirling with the last wild leaf. The eve was strange; now dusk comes weird and wide, Gaunt as a life that lives alone with grief: So hope is gone, and doubt and loss abide. An empty nest hangs where the wood-bird pled; Along the west the dusk dies, stormy red: The frost falls, subtle as a serpent's breath. The dusk was sad; now night is overhead, Grim as a life brought face to face with death: So life lives on when love, its life, lies dead. II Go your own ways. Who shall persuade me now To look with high face for a star of hope? Or up endeavor's unsubduable slope Advance a bosom of desire, and bow A back of patience in a thankless task? Alone beside the grave of love I ask, Shalt thou? or thou? Leave go my hands. Fain would I walk alone The easy ways of silence and of sleep. What though I go with eyes that can not weep, And lips contracted with no uttered moan, Through rocks and thorns, where every footprint bleeds, A dead-sea path of desert night that leads To one white stone! Though sands be black and bitter black the sea, Night lie before me and behind me night, And God within far Heaven refuse to light The consolation of the dawn for me,â Between the shadowy bournes of Heaven and Hell, It is enough love leaves my soul to dwell With memory. THE WORLD'S DESIRE The roses of voluptuousness Wreathe her dark locks and hide her eyes; Her limbs are flower-like nakedness, Wherethrough the fragrant blood doth press, The blossom-blood of Paradise. She stands with Lilith finger-tips, With Lilith hands; and gathers up The grapes of life; whose wine she sips,â With Lilith-laughter-lightened lips,â The soul, as from a curious cup. What though she cast the cup away! The empty bowl that flashed with wine! Her lips' wild kiss, that stained the clay, Her hands' hot claspâshall these not stay, That made its nothingness divine? Through one again shall live the glow, Immortalizing, of her touch; And through the other, sweet to know How life swept, flame once, 'neath the snow Of her moon'd breastsâand this is much! THE UNATTAINABLE Mark thou! a shadow crowned with fire of hell. Man holds her in his heart as night doth hold The moonlight memories of day's dead gold; Or as a winter-withered asphodel In its dead loveliness holds scents of old. And looking on her, lo, he thinks 't is well. Who would not follow her whose glory sits, Imperishably lovely, on the air? Who, from the arms of Earth's desire, flits With eyes defiant and rebellious hair?â Hers is the beauty that no man shall share. He who hath seen, what shall it profit him? He who doth love, what shall his passion gain? When disappointment at her cup's bright brim Poisons the pleasure with the hemlock pain? Hers is the passion that no man shall drain. How long, how long since Life hath kissed her eyes, Making their night clairvoyant! And how long Since Love hath kissed her lips and made them wise, Mixing their speech with prophecy and song! Hope clad her nakedness in lovely lies, Giving into her hands the right of wrong! Lo! in her world she sets pale tents of thought, Unearthly bannered; and her dreams' wild bands Besiege the heavens like a twilight fraught With recollections of lost stars. She stands Radiant as Lilith glowing from God's hands. The golden rose of patience at her throat Drops fragrant petalsâas a pensive tune Drops its surrendered sweetness note by note;â And from her hands the buds of hope are strewn, Moon-flowers, mothered of the barren moon. So in her flowers man seats him at her feet In star-faced worship, knowing all of this; And now to him to die seems very sweet, Filled with the fire of her look and kiss; While in his heart the blood's tumultuous beat Drowns, in her own, the drowsing serpent's hiss. He who hath dreamed but of her world shall give All of his soul unto her restlessly: He who hath seen but her far face shall live No more for things we name reality: Such is the power of her tyranny. He, whom she wins, hath nothing 'neath the sun; Forgetting all that she may not forget He loves her, who still feeds his soul upon Dreams and desires, and doubt and vain regret,â Life's bitter bread his heart's fierce tears make wet. What word of wisdom hast thou, Life, to wake Him now! or song of magic now to dull The dreams he lives in! or what charm to break The spell that makes her evil beautiful! What charm to show her beauty hides a snake, Whose basilisk eyes burn dark behind a skull! PROBLEMS Man's is the learning of his booksâ What is all knowledge that he knows Beside the wit of winding brooks, The wisdom of the summer rose! How soil distils the scent in flowers Baffles his science: heaven-dyed, How, from the sunshine and the showers, They draw their colors, hath defied. Nor hath he solved why light is white, Yet paints with hues the dawns and noons, Stains all the hollow edge of night With glory as of molten moons. What knows he of the laws of birth Or death, or what these are and why! Or what it is within the earth That helps us live and helps us die! THE BEAUTIFUL I Of moires of placid glitter The moon is knitter, Under dark trees, whose branches The blue night blanches: Upon yon stream's swift arrow Lights lie, as narrow As is the glance of some pale sorceress, Spell-haunted, watching in a wilderness. And I, who, dreaming, wander, Seem to behold her yonder, My beautiful dream, my bodiless loveliness. II Upon this water's glimmer White sheets of shimmer Glow outward, as if inner Sea-castles,âthinner Than peelÃ©d pearl,âthrough curlings And water whirlings, Let spray the light of lucid dome and spire, The smoldering silver of an inward fire.â Perhaps her towers, enchanted, Are there; on mountains planted Of crystal:âhers! the soul of my desire! III Or there above the beeches, On terraced reaches Of rolling roses, towered And moonbeam-bowered, Is it her palace airy?â Or dream of Fairy?â Piled, full of melody and marble-white, Its pointed casements lit with piercing light: Wherein, all veiled and hidden, She waits,âwho long hath bidden Me come to her,âher accoladed knight? IV The blue night's sweetness settlesâ Like hyacinth petals, Bowed by their weight of rain-dropsâ Around me: pain drops From off my heart, the sadness Of life to gladness Of beauty turns, that was not born to die; That whispers in my soul and tells me why I, too, was bornâto render Her worship: feel her splendor Expand me like a rose beneath God's eye. WORLD'S ATTAINMENT A Lorelei full fair she sits Above the Stream of Life that rolls; And, hope-thrilled, with her wild harp knits To her from year to year men's souls. They hear her harp, they hear her song, Behold her beauty throned on high, And gazing on her, sweep along, Strike on the rocks and sink and die. A BLOWN ROSE Lay but a finger on Its pallid petals sweet, They flutter, gray and wan, Beneath the passing feet. But, soft! blown rose, although Departed is thy bloom,â Thy bud, thy youth, I know, Had no such sweet perfume. Thou art like one whose page Of life is beauty-fraught, Who grays to ripe old-age, Sweet-mellowed through with thought: Who, when his hoary head Is wept into the tomb, With dreams, that are not dead, Still gives his name perfume. NEPENTHE Ah, it is well for men to strain And strive and yearn to rise; The soul's salvation is in pain, In toil and sacrifice. The grandest souls that rose above, Thought's noblest heights to tread, Found consolation in their love, And life behind the dead. A living glory in the tomb, Whose night shall end in light; An intense splendor veiled with gloom, Too blinding for earth's sight. Nepenthe of this struggling world, Whose knowledge comforts care, And in the heart, where it is curled, Conquers the snake, despair. ON A DIAL Look on my face: to-morrow I am to-day. From me you may not borrow Or take away. I mark life's mirth and sorrow, Birth and decay. I know nor joy nor sadness: I go, yet stay: And men in me find gladness And grief, they say: I stay not for their madness, Nor pass away. UNUTTERABLE There is a sorrow in the wind to-night That haunteth me; she, like a penitent, Heaps on rent hair the snow's thin ashes white, And moans and moans, her swaying body bent. And Superstition, gliding softly, shakes With wasted hands, that vainly grope and seek, The rustling curtains; of each cranny makes Wild, ghostly lips that, wailing, fain would speak. QUESTIONINGS Now that wan sunsets, wintery With icy gold, paint bleak the sky; Now nights are starless utterly, And snow and sleet cut moaning by, One's memory keeps one company, And sorrow puts its âwhenâ and âwhy.â Such inquisition, when alone, Leads on to ways of doubt and dread, Despair has miled with many a stone, Carved with the faces of our dead, Stamped on whose brows we read, âUnknown! No further look, nor seek to tread.â And, oh! that weariness of soul That leans upon our dead, the clod And air have taken, as a whole, Through some mysterious period!â Life! with its questions of control! Death! with its unguessed laws of God! FRAGMENTS I The curtains of my couch sway heavily: 'Tis death, who parts the curtains of my soul.â Sleep, like a gray expression of ghost lips Heard through the moonlight of a haunted room, Seems near yet far away. Would God 't were day! II âStay not too long, love, stay not long away!â Lightly my heart said when we kissed farewell. But now my heart is heavy with hard newsâ Oh! bitterness of kisses that were sweet! III Tear from my heart and under furious feet Trample the golden record of our love, Love's book of golden days, despair! despair! IV Night is a grave physician, who contrives The drug of sleep to heal day's bruises with, The drug of death for life's delirium.â V On lost expanses of a phantom land Life stands; and, overhead, one sinister star, A baleful beacon, burns: heav'n seems a hand Of jeweled darkness pointing her her way, Mournful, through shadows of lugubrious hills And rising tempest, to a house, a shape Placid and pale and silent utterly. VI O undivulging, unresponsive fate, Is gold another name for power and crime? Life, dust long dedicated unto death? And death? is it all darkness without light? Whereto all things go groping, love and joy And beauty, glow-worms, flickering each its spark? Precious as gold does anything avail? Steadfast as tablets of the eternal stars, What deeds of man, when time hath touched them, last? DEITY No personal! No God divinely crowned With gold and raised upon a golden throne, Deep in a golden glory,âwhence he nods Man this or that,âand little more than man! Thus I divine Him: When the soul, refined Through love and wisdom through a thousand years, Shall mount as pure intelligence and pierce The separate cycles singing under God,â Their iridescent evolutions orbed Or wild electric splendor,âit shall see (Through God-propinquity become a god) Resplendencies of empyrean light Swift-lightening out of spheric harmonies: Prisms and facets of ten million beams Starring a crystal of wild-rainbowed rays: And in itâeyes: of burning sapphire, eyes Deep as the music of the beautiful: And o'er the eyes, limpid, hierarchal brows, As they were lilies of seraphic fire: Lips underneath of trembling rubyâlips, Whose smile is light and each expression, song. In multiplying myriads, forms of fire, Cherubic faces of intensity, Waiting His look, that is electric thought, To work His will, spirits on spirits stand Circling the Unit, God: Supremity Creative and eternal. And from Him Man's intellect, detached, expelled and breathed Exaltant into flesh endowed with soul,â One sparkle of the Essence clothed with clay,â Is given to Earth for something more than earth, Some purpose, some divine development,â That protoplasmic evolution proves,â That lifts him upward, heart and soul and mind, From matter to ideal potencies, Up to the source and fountain of all mind, Beauty and truth and everlasting love, To be resumed and re-absorbed in themâ One more expression of Eternity. DISENCHANTMENT OF DEATH Hush! she is dead. Tread gently as the light Steals in the weary room. Thou shalt behold. Look:âin death's ermine pomp of awful white, Pale passion of pulseless slumber, very cold, Her beautiful youth!âProud as heroic might,â Brought low by him whose touch is shadow and mold. Old earth she is now: energy of birth Hath fledged glad wings and tried them suddenly: The eyes that held have freed their maiden mirth: The spark of spirit, which made this to be, Shines in some fairer star than this of Earth, Some Fairy-star of far eternity. A sod is this; whence, what were once those eyes, Will grow blue wildflowers in some happier air! Some weed with flossy blossoms will surprise, Haply, some summer with her affluent hair! Some rose reveal her cheeks: and the wise skies Will clasp her beauty in some young tree there. The chastity of death hath filled her so No dreams of life may reach her in her rest; No dreams the heart exhausted here below, Hopes built within the romance of her breast. Now she will sleep, like music, silent, slow,â That wakes the buds, to golden life caressed. The winds of spring, that whisper to the grass; The rain, that sets the red roots harping; sound, And gleam and color of the dews that glass Globes of concentric beauty on the ground; Shall hint of her; and she herself shall pass, Like prayer, into each flower with memory crowned. So, though she 's dead, you see she is not dead: All things are vocal of her: lost in sleep She lies: its narrow house the soul hath fled; Her soul, still near us, haply; while the deep Remains unvoyaged: waiting to be led It still delays, held here by us who weep. We should restrain our anguish;â(merciless, Albeit it is, and bitter cruel the grave:)â Grief wrings our dead with more than grief's distress, Earth chaining love, bound by the lips that rave. And curse not death!âYea, rather let us bless That conqueror who makes us less a slave! To principles of passion and of pride; To sin and circumstance and lust and law! Slave to all these, like rags now flung aside!â Wouldst have the soul resume them, and withdraw From its inheritance, where, as a bride, It stands arrayed in glory and in awe? âUnjustâ?âGod is not. Yea, hast thou not all, All that thou ever hadst when this dull clay, Thy well belovÃ©d, made the spiritual A restless vassal of the night and day? This hath been thine and is: the cosmic call Rang through this house, and took its own away. But man, in selfishness, from its estate,â Won with what pains and devastating cares, What bootless battling with resistless fate, What mailed endeavor with unyielding years,â Would bar the soul, Heaven grants him here as mate, And being compelled, returns Heaven's loan with tears. SLEEP Look in my eyes!âOh, the mild and mysterious Deeps of thine eyes that are holy with rest!â Sigh to me! yea, as thy kinsman, imperious Love, might, with lips that are soft and delirious, Soft with such comfort as blesses the blessed. Fold all my soul in the mild and mysterious Might of thy rest. All the night for thy love, all the night! while the gladdening Presence of darkness, as legends of old, Wraps me in poesy: none of the saddening Prose of the day that is sad with the maddening Soul of unrest that is heartless and cold. All the night for thy love, all the night! and its gladdening Beauty of old. Scorn is not thine nor is hate; but the bubbling Fountains of strength that are youthful as morn's: Hurt is not thine of remembrance; nor troubling Sorrows of waking whose fingers keep doublingâ Pressing on temples life's cares that are thorns. Thine are the hours of the stars and the bubbling Wells of the morns. Pride and the passions and labors that worry us Mix with and brutalize; envy and spite Of the heart; and the griefs of the soul that oft hurry us On, with the iron of anguish, and bury us,â Touch them and calm with thy fingers of white. Make all these passions and pains, that oft worry us, Night with the night. Silence hath built thee a mansion, where flowery Fields of the visions are poppied with dreams; Where the high mountains of quiet loom showery Under the stars; and the valleys of bowery Lotus and moly gleam, misty with streams: Where slumber's halcyon waters third flowery Pastures of dreams. Come to me, Spirit!âAh, wilt thou not stay for me? Stay for me! fill me with rest as with prayer! Mother of hope, let thy touch soothe away for me All of life's weariness! make all the day for me Dim with forgetting! the day and its care! Come to me! Mix with the soul of me! Stay for me, Cure me like prayer! CHATTERTON âI thought of Chatterton, the marvellous boy, The sleepless soul that perished in his pride.â âWordsworth. He dreamed of Mendip Hills, and woods So deep, storm-barriers on the sky Are not more dark, that rain their floods From clouds of sullen dye: And Somerset, where sparsely grew Gnarled, iron-colored oaks, with rifts, Between old boughs, of April blue: Ways where the speedwell lifts Its bit of heav'n; and, spreading far,â The gold, the fallen gold of dawn Held captive in each cowslip's star,â The meadows led him on. Where, round his feet, the lady-smock And pearl-pale lady-slipper crept; Where butterflies, pied-wing'd, did rock, Or, seal-brown, sucked and slept. O'er which the west shot crooked fire Athwart a half-moon leaning low; While one white, arrowy star throbbed higher In curdled honey-glow. Was it some elfin euphrasy That purged his sight and said, âPrepare! See where the daisies beckon thee; The harebells ring to prayer? âCome here and dream! far from the roofs, The grime and smoke of London Town, That monster, with its myriad hoofs, That grinds the poet down!â Not different from his days our days, That break the poet's heart. No love Or pity after death repays The soul that failed and strove. They found him dead his songs beside, Long stairs above the din and dust Of life: and that for which he died Denied him even a crust. THE SYMPHONY The soul of love is harmony: as such All melodies, that with wide pinions beat Against the heart's red gateway to the soul,â That, opening, bids them enter in and sing,â Are portions of the soul, and while they stay, Lords of its action molding all at will. There is a symphony, I know not whose, That seems to bear my spirit far away, To regions not of Earth nor yet of Heaven, Where neither am I I, nor air, nor clay, My soul, a portion of the waves of song, Reverberating 'twixt the earth and moon. First, sweeping marches, loud with martial boast, Triumphal clamors and the shout of joy, As when,âin bannered cities, welcoming home,â Bright ranks of victory and cavalcades Of splendid battle march to roll of drums And clang of cymbals and sonorous horns. Then sudden thunder; adverse hosts of storm; And lightning cleaving the tempestuous gloom; Earthquake, and roar of ruin as if Thebes And Karnac crashed their Titan temples down, Pillar and groinÃ©d nave and fretted dome, On all their gods of gold and worshippers. Then from the wreck, unutterably slow, An exhalation seems to beat, of sound, An audible perfume; slowly as the fang Of dusty gold the lily's cone puts forth To drink the sunlight and to lure the bee: A mist of music, delicate as the shapes Who ride the rainbow bubbles of the foam Of mountain cataracts; or, who, heeled with flame, Wing-tipped with fire, make couriers of the winds, And, zoned with opal, chariot the morning star. Then soft complaints that fill the waiting heart With dreams of love long-cherished; love-dreams found On morning mountains, splendid with the dawn. Then tender chords that weigh the eyelids down With sleep's pale kisses, softer than the buds That open to the spring, the kiss of May; And sweeter than sweet vows of fondest faith Kept evermore; or looks, whose witchery Might lure old saints down to the lowest Hell For one last glance: then notes like haunting eyes, Great, melancholy eyes of love long lost, Darker than night, and brimming o'er with dreams; Or faces, stooping in a silver mist At Care's thin brow, and gazing in his eyes, Sad where he sits before the smouldering logs, At Yuletide, when the sleet taps on the pane, And all the loved are gone, and he 's alone, Alone, save for the memories that rise Faint in the ashes and the spark-starred smoke. Then, from these chords, these mortal ecstasies, Dim as the half-forgotten dreams of youth, Voices of expectation chorus up,â The diapason of a mighty choir,â 'Mid organ throbbings, ever beating low Like the huge heart of Ocean; pulsings wove Of deep, Ã¦olian thunders: and my soul Seems wafted far beneath the sea of seas, To chasms and caves of crystal, ocean-carved, Filled with dark lamentations of the deep, Deep, dolorous seas, that throb like some vast harp, Wild, oceanic, and with stormy sighs Of labyrinthine music shake the world. One with the tumult,âunder circling tiers Of beryl and chrysoberyl, splashed and hung Pale with pelagian gems and feathery shells, And spars of moony radiance,âon I drift, A voice 'mid voices, chord amid the chords, A wave, a wild vibration of the strain, Part of the ray, the rose of melody, An utterance amid that utterance Of choral harmony: now rising up,â As 't were a spire of silver symphony Blown from a reed of hollow pearl and fire By some still spirit dwelling within the moon,â To the vast vault of echoes: dying now Down to the underworld of silence, deep With wild, unburdened sobbings; then, once more, Sweeping the vault with tumult, like a bird With maddened wings, that beat and bleed in vain Against the bars; or like the human soul, Oppressed and bulked within its cage of clay, That longs and strains to burst its bonds and soar. Then tones that shape before my inner sight The moonlit gardens of the spirit, Sleep, Far on a star man's eyes have never seen: White Sleep, who leads me 'mid her poppies, weighed With dewy slumber; from whose chalices She culls white dreams to lay on human hearts In pearly clusters sparkling now with tears And now with smiles; the blossoms of her soul. She, on her shadowy pinions, winging high, Bears me from pole to pole of her white star, The continents like clouds beneath our feet, The seas like mists; then drops me, meteor-like, A million leagues, through all the gulfs of God, Down, down to Earth again; a sound of stars, Streaming from burning orbits into night, About my soul, about my soul like fire. Oh, then what agony and bitter woe, Regret and noise of desolation, vast As when all that one loves is torn away Forever with âfarewell forevermoreâ! Oh, strife and panic of impending doom! Wherein rush by pale brows with tresses torn; Pale faces browed with raven, rended hair, That cringe or fly before the wrath of God, Or stand white-lifted to the bolts of Heaven, Ploughing the tempest, chasmed with torrent flame As 't were with rocking earthquake. All around Ruin and terror, moans and awful eyes, Fierce, moveless eyes that seem to curse their God: Then sounds, as 't were, of burning tears that fall Through blinding blackness: thenâlong thunder strokes As of a bell that tolls â'T is Judgment Day!â Sonorous bell-beats heard through night and storm, O'er hands high lifted as it were in prayer Or battling with their doom: still tolling on, The knell of dying Earth and of the Dawn; The Dawn that will not break, that comes no more; Never again; the beautiful, wild Dawn, The young, the holy, radiant and wonderful, First born of Heaven's children, daughters of Light: The Rose of God, the dream and youth of Day, Whom Night hath slain and Darkness laid away, Crying, âNo more shall she awake the world! No more! no more!âThe Dawn, aurora-wreathed, Lies dead with all her flow'rs! and Death and I, Darkness and Death, Lords of Oblivion, Heart-shaking monarchs of the universe, Throned on the ruins of the world, shall rule From everlasting unto everlasting now!â Look on our faces, Nations, and despair!â A SONG FOR OLD AGE Now nights grow cold and colder, And north the wild vane swings, And round each tree and boulder The driving snow-storm singsâ Come, make my old heart older, O memory of lost things! Of Hope, when promise sung her Brave songs, and I was young, That banquets now on hunger Since all youth's songs are sung; Of Love, who walks with younger Sweethearts the flowers among. Ah, well! while Life holds levee, Death's ceaseless dance goes on. So let the curtains, heavy About my couch, be drawnâ The curtains, dark and heavy, Where all shall sleep anon. âWHEN THE WINE-CUP AT THE LIPâ When the wine-cup at the lip Slants its ruby fire, O'er its level, while you sip, Have you marked the finger-tip Of the god Desire slip, Of the god Desire? SayingââLo, the hours run! Live your day before 't is done!â When the empty goblet lies At the ended revel, In the glass, the wine-stain dyes, Have you marked the hollow eyes Of a mocking Devil rise, Of a mocking Devil? SayingââLo, the pleasure's done! Look on me whose hour's begun!â THE BETTER LOT Her life was bound to crutches: pale and bent, But smiling ever, she would go and come: For of her soul God made an instrument Of strength and comfort to an humble home. Better a life of toil and slow disease That Love companions through the patient years, Than one whose heritage is loveless ease, That never knows the blessedness of tears. PASSION The wine-loud laughter of indulged desire Upon his lips, and, in his eyes, the fire Of uncontrol, he takes in reckless hands,â And interrupts with discords,âthe sad lyre Of Love's deep soul, and never understands. THE TROGLODYTE In ages dead, a troglodyte, At the hollow roots of a monster height,â That grew from the heart of the world to light,â I dwelt in caverns: Over me Were mountains older than the moon; And forests, vaster than the sea, And gulfs, that the earthquake's hand had hewn, Hung under me. And late and soon I heard the DÃ¦mon of Change that sighed A cosmic language of mystery; Where I sat silent, primeval-eyed, With the infant Spirit of Prophecy. Gaunt stars glared down on the Titan peaks; And the gaunter glare of the cratered streaks Of the sunset's ruin heard condor shrieks: The roar of cataracts hurled in air, And the hurricane, laying its thunders bare, And the rush of battling beasts,âwhose lair Was the antechamber of nadir-gloom,â Were my outworld joys. But who can tell The awe of the depths whence rose the boom Of the iron rivers that fashioned Hell! THE EVANESCENT BEAUTIFUL Day after day, young with eternal beauty, Pays flowery duty to the month and clime; Night after night erects a vasty portal Of stars immortal for the march of Time. But where are now the glory and the rapture, That once did capture me in cloud and stream? Where now the joy, that was both speech and silence? Where the beguilance that was fact and dream? I know that Earth and Heaven are as golden As they of olden made me feel and see; Not in themselves is lacking aught of power Through star and flowerâsomething's lost in me. âReturn! return!â I cry, âO visions vanished, O voices banished, to my soul again!ââ The near Earth blossoms and the far skies glisten, I look and listen, but, alas! in vain. THE HIGHER BROTHERHOOD To come in touch with mysteries Of beauty idealizing Earth, Go seek the hills, grown green with trees, The old hills wise with death and birth. There you may hear the heart that beats In streams, where music has its source; And in wild rocks of mossed retreats Behold the silent soul of force. Above the love that emanates From human passion, and reflects The flesh, must be the love that waits On Nature, whose high call elects None to her secrets save the few Who hold that facts are far less real Than dreams, with which all facts indue Themselves approaching the ideal. TO A WINDFLOWER I Teach me the secret of thy loveliness, That, being made wise, I may aspire to be As beautiful in thought, and so express Immortal truths to Earth's mortality; Though to my soul ability be less Than 't is to thee, O sweet anemone. II Teach me the secret of thy innocence, That in simplicity I may grow wise; Asking from Art no other recompense Than the approval of her own just eyes; So may I rise to some fair eminence, Though less than thine, O cousin of the skies. III Teach me these things; through whose high knowledge, I,â When Death hath poured oblivion through my veins, And brought me home, as all are brought, to lie In that vast House, common to serfs and Thanes,â I shall not die, I shall not utterly die, For beauty born of beautyâthat remains. MICROCOSM The memory of what we've lost Is with us more than what we've won; Perhaps because we count the cost By what we could, yet have not done. 'Twixt act and purpose fate hath drawn Invisible threads we can not break, And puppet-like these move us on The stage of life, and break or make. Less than the dust from which we're wrought, We come and go, and still are hurled From change to change, from naught to naught, Heirs of oblivion and the world. FORTUNE Within the hollowed hand of God Blood-red they lie, the dice of Fate, That have no time nor period, And know no early and no late. Postpone you can not, nor advance Success or failure that 's to be; All fortune, being born of chance, Is bastard child to destiny. Bow down your head, or hold it high, Consent, defyâno smallest part Of this you change, although the die Was fashioned from your living heart. DEATH Through some strange sense of sight or touch I find what all have found before,â The presence I have feared so much, The unknown's immaterial door. I seek not and it comes to me: I do not know the thing I find: The fillet of fatality Drops from my brows that made me blind. Point forward now or backward, Light! The way I take I may not choose: Out of the night into the night, And in the night no certain clews. But on the future, dim and vast, And dark with dust and sacrifice, Death's towering ruin from the past Makes black the land that round me lies. THE SOUL An heritage of hopes and fears And dreams and memory, And vices of ten thousand years God gives to thee. A house of clay, the home of Fate, Haunted of Love and Sin, Where Death stands knocking at the gate To let him in. CONSCIENCE Within the soul are throned two powers, Named Love and Hate. Begot of these, And veiled between, a presence towers, The shadowy Keeper of the Keys. With wild command or calm persuasion This one may argue, that compel: Vain are concealment and evasionâ For each he opens Heaven and Hell. YOUTH I Morn's mystic rose is reddening on the hills; Dawn's irised nautilus makes glad the sea; There is a lyre of flame that throbs and fills Far heaven and earth with hope's wild ecstasy.â With lilied field and grove, Haunts of the turtle-dove, Here is the land of Love. II The chariot of the noon makes blind the blue As towards the goal his burning axle glares; There is a fiery trumpet thrilling through Wide heaven and earth with deeds of one who dares.â With peaks of splendid name, Wrapped round with astral flame, Here is the land of Fame. III The purple priesthood of the evening waits With golden pomp within the templed skies; There is a harp of worship at the gates Of heaven and earth that bids the soul arise.â With columned cliffs and long Vales, music breathes among, Here is the land of Song. IV Moon-crowned the epic of the night unrolls Its starry utterance o'er height and deep; There is a voice of beauty at the souls Of heaven and earth that lulls the heart asleep.â With storied woods and streams, Where marble glows and gleams, Here is the land of Dreams. LIFE'S SEASONS I When all the world was May-day, And all the skies were blue, Young innocence made play-day Among the buds and dew; Then all of life was May-day And clouds were none or few. II When all the world was Summer, And morn shone overhead, Love was the sweet new-comer Who led youth forth to wed; Then all of life was Summer, And clouds were gold and red. III When earth was all October, And days were gray with mist, On woodways, sad and sober, Grave memory kept her tryst; Then life was all October, And clouds were twilight-kissed. IV Now all the world's December, And night is all alarm, Above the last dim ember Age bends to keep him warm; Now all of life's December, And clouds are driven storm. THE LIGHT AND LARK Hangs, stormed with stars, the night, Deep over deep; Each star a point of light In God's high keep. In God's?âPerhaps.âOf such We can not tell, Who shrinkâand is it much?â To say farewell. There 'tis the dawn and lark: Here 'tis the wail, Sobbed through the ceaseless dark, O' the nightingale. But what were all this worth To thee or me, Were there not, after earth, Eternity? God gives us life to keep.â And what hath life?â Love, faith, and care, and sleep, Where dreams are rife. Death's sleep! whose shadows start The tears in eyes Of Love, who breaks his heart, Despairs and dies. And faith is never given Without some care, Perhaps that leads to Heaven By ways of prayer. The nightingale and dark He gives us here:â Oh, for the light and lark Eternal there! THE JESSAMINE AND THE MORNING-GLORY I With his herald torch in the van of day The star of the morning smiled; And the streaks in the east were rosy gray, And the earth lay undefiled, When a morning-glory's spiral bud, As pink as a shell and slim, Unbound the sark of her maidenhood, And flashed on the dawning dim: Royal she seemed, to the purple born, And vain of her beauty and proud to scorn. II And she shook her locks at the morning-star, And her raiment fluttered wide; Then smiled above at his scimitar, And gazed around in pride: The pomegranate near, with its crown of flame, And the gemmed geraniums nigh, All bowed their heads at her whispered name, As she throned herself on high; While the fuchsia, under her silvery hood, Shrunk with a face like a bead of blood. III All knew that this child of the morning light Was queen of the morn and them; That the morning-star, in his beams of white, Was her prince in a diadem: 'T was he who had given those gems that flash And jewel the front of her smock; From his lordly fingers of light did dash Down pearls where she stooped to mock A jessamine, pale, in the garden's gloom, All wan of face, but of sweet perfume. IV And the morning-glory, in pride of birth, From the jessamine turned in scorn: âI marvel,â she said, âif thy mother earth Was not sick when thou wast born! Thou art pale as an infant an hour dead- Wan thing, dost weary our eye!â And she weakly laughed and stiffened her head And turned to her star in the sky. And the jessamine sighed, as she bent her head, âI am sick of myself, and I would I were dead!â V And the east grew gold with burning bars, And the sun in his chariot came; And this princess proud saw her lord of stars Snuffed out like a taper's flame: And higher the lord of the light and hours Glared up the glittering sky, And the fragile queen of the morning flowers In his beams did wilt and die: But the jessamine waxed in the sun-god's ray, And her breath and her beauty made sweet the day. THE TOAD IN THE SKULL A human skull in a churchyard lay; For the church was a wreck, and, toppling old, On the graves of their dead, were the tomb-stones gray, And crumbling into mold. And a hideous toad of this skull had made A house, a hermitage, long agone, Where the ivy-tod with many a braid Half-hid his cell of bone. And the place was dark; and my feet were drawn To the desolate spot where the tottering tombs Seemed sheeted ghosts in the twilight wan Of the yew-invested glooms. The night her crescent had slimly hung From a single star o'er the shattered wall, And its feeble light on the stone was flung Where I sat to hear him call. And I heard this heremite toad as he sate In the gloom of his ghastly hermitage To himself and the gloom all hollowly prate, Like a misanthropic sage: âOh, beauty is well and wealth to all; But wealth without beauty makes fair: And beauty with wealth brings wooers tall Whom she snares with her golden hair. âThough beauty be well and be wealth to all, And wealth without beauty draw men, Beauty must come to the vaulted wall, And what is wealth to her then? . . . âThis skeleton face was beautiful erst; These sockets were brighter than stars; And she bartered her beauty for gold accurstâ But the story is older than Mars!â . . . And he blinked at the moon from his grinning cell, And the darnels and burdocks were stirred, Cold-swept of the wind, and I shuddered.âWell! Perhaps 't was my heart I had heard. THE MOONMEN I stood in the forest on Huron Hill When the night was old and the world was still. The Wind was a wizard who muttering strode In a raven cloak on a haunted road. The Sound of Water, a witch who crooned Her spells to the rocks the rain had runed. And the Gleam of the Dew on the fern's green tip Was a sylvan passing with robe a-drip. The Light of the Stars was a glimmering maid Who stole, an elfin, from glade to glade. The Scent of the Woods in the delicate air, A wild-flower shape with chilly hair. And Silence, a spirit who sat alone With lifted finger and eyes of stone. And it seemed to me these six were met To greet a greater who came not yet. And the speech they spoke, that I listened to, Was the archetype of the speech I knew. For the Wind clasped hands with the Water's rush, And I heard them whisper, âHush, oh, hush!â The Light of the Stars and the Dew's cool Gleam Touched lips and mumured, âDream, oh, dream!â The Scent of the Woods and the Silence deep Sighed, bosom to bosom, âSleep, oh, sleep!â And so for a moment the six were dumb, Then exulted together, âThey come, they come!â And I stood expectant and seemed to hear A visible music drawing near. And the first who came was the Captain Moon Bearing a shield in God's House hewn. Then an Army of Glamour, a glittering host, Beleaguered the night from coast to coast. And the world was filled with spheric fire From the palpitant chords of many a lyre, As out of the East the Moonmen came Smiting their harps of silver and flame. More beauty and grace did their forms express Than the God of Love's white nakedness. More chastity too their faces held Than the snowy breasts of Diana swelled. Translucent-limbed, I saw the beat In their hearts of pearl of the golden heat. And the hair they tossed was a crystal light, And the eyes beneath it were burning white. Their hands that lifted, their feet that fell, Made the darkness blossom to asphodel. And the heavens, the hills, and the streams they trod Shone pale with th' communicated God. A placid frenzy, a waking trance, A soft oracular radiance, Wrapped forms that moved as melodies move, Laurelled with Godhead and haloed with Love. And there in the forest on Huron Hill The Moonmen camped when the world was still. What wonder that they who have looked on these Are lost to the earth's realities! That they sit aside with a far-off look Dreaming the dreams that are writ in no book! That they walk alone till the day they die, Even as I, yea, even as I! PHANTOMS This was her home; one mossy gable thrust Above the cedars and the locust trees: This was her home, whose beauty now is dust, A lonely memory for melodies The wild birds sing, the wild birds and the bees. Here every evening is a prayer: no boast Or ruin of sunset makes the wan world wroth; Here, through the twilight, like a pale flower's ghost, A drowsy flutter, flies the tiger-moth; And dusk spreads darkness like a dewy cloth. In vagabond velvet, all the placid day A stain of crimson, lolls the butterfly; The south-wind sows with ripple and with ray The pleasant waters; and the gentle sky Looks on the homestead like a quiet eye. Their melancholy quaver, lone and low, When day is done, the gray tree-toads repeat: The whippoorwills, far in the afterglow, Complain to silence: and the lightnings beat, In one still cloud, glimmers of golden heat. He comes not yet: not till the dusk is dead, And all the western glow is far withdrawn; Not till,âa sleepy mouth love's kiss makes red,â The baby bud opes in a rosy yawn, Breathing sweet guesses of the dreamed-of dawn. When in the shadows, like a rain of gold, The fireflies stream steadily; and bright Along the moss the glow-worm, as of old, A crawling sparkleâlike a crooked light In smoldering vellumâscrawls a square of night,â Then will he come, and she will lean to him,â She who is buried there, within that place,â Between the starlight and his eyes; so dim With suave control and soul-compelling grace, He can not help but see her, face to face. THE HOUSE OF DEATH (A Dream) I Starless and still and lustreless And sombre black, it seemed to me, The heaven hung in hideousness Of Hell's serenity: Indefinite and vague and old As nothing that is ours, It rose turrets, dark with mould, And dark, colossal towers. II Infernal monsters crumbled 'mid The trefoils of its dim faÃ§ade, And, hideous as murder, hid Gnarled in the pillared shade. And all below and overhead, In cancerous blotches, grew The gray gangrene of lichens dead, And fungus, sickly blue. III Beneath the black, impending skies, Like Death's dead countenance it stood, Hollow, with cavernous window-eyes Staring on solitude. The grass was black, and in it, white The tombstones rose; and gray, Long league on league, adown the night, Like phantoms, stretched away. IV And I, who entered in, could hear No organ notes resound and roll, But silence, like an awful fear, Made tumult in my soul. And, lo! I saw, like Hell's wild songs, The vast interior carved With shapes of stone, vague woman throngs, Naked, obscene, and starved. V Medusa mouths and harpy hands, And Gorgon eyes where death abode; Like idols, wherein heathen lands Image the Plague's black god. Round mighty door and window-frame, On floor and vault, behold, The chiselled forms were all the sameâ Gray with exuding mold. VI And I, who entered in, in dread Felt silence like some awful hymnâ Or was't the effluvia of the dead That round me seemed to swim? Miasms, from which had oozed its walls, Had rotted, breath on breath, This house, within whose haunted halls Death sat and dreamed of death. EIDOLONS The white moth-mullein brushed its slim Cool, fairy flowers against his knee; In places where the way lay dim The branches, arching hollowly, Made tomb-like mystery for him. The wild-rose and the elder, drenched With rain, made pale a misty place,â From which, as from a ghost, he blenched; He walking with averted face, And lips white-closed and teeth tight-clenched. For far within the forest,âwhere Weird shadows stood like phantom men, And where the ground-hog dug its lair, The she-fox whelped and had her den,â The thing kept calling, buried there. One dead trunk, like a ruined tower, Dark green with toppling trailers, shoved Its wild wreck o'er the brush; one bower Looked like a dead man, capped and gloved, The thing that haunted him each hour. Now at his side he heard it: thin As echoes of a thought that speaks In sleep: and, listening with his chin Upon his palm, unto his cheeks He felt the moon's slow silver win. And now the voice was still: and lo, With eyes that stared on naught but night, He looked and sawâwhat none shall know! The form of one, who long from sight Had lain, here murdered long ago? . . . And men who found him,âthither led By the she-fox,âwithin that place Saw in his stony eyes, 't is said, The thing he met there face to face, The thing that left him staring dead. IDENTITIES I sat alone in the arrased room Of Sin, wrapped pale in her winding shroud; The night was stricken with glare and gloom, And the wailing wind was loud. I heard the gallop of one who rode Like a rushing leaf on the wind that lisps; The night with the speed of her steed was sowed With streaming will-o'-the-wisps. And I said to myself, â'Tis a long-lost Shame, Who rides to my house through the night and rain! She will blaze in the blackness a face of flame When she opens the door again!â I thought of the blame on her lips and brow; And stared at the door she must enter inâ To sear my soul with her eyes and bow My heart by the corpse of Sin. As hushed as the mansion of death was night, When, dark as a sob of the storm, she cameâ But her face, like beautiful Sin's, was white, And her face and Sin'sâthe same! HALLOWE'EN It was down in the woodland on last Hallowe'en, Where silence and darkness had built them a lair, That I felt the dim presence of her, the unseen, And heard her still step on the hush-haunted air. It was last Hallowe'en in the glimmer and swoon Of mist and of moonlight, where once we had sinned, That I saw the gray gleam of her eyes in the moon, And hair, like a raven, blown wild on the wind. It was last Hallowe'en where starlight and dew Made mystical marriage on flower and leaf, That she led me with looks of a love, that I knew Was dead, and the voice of a passion too brief. It was last Hallowe'en in the forest of dreams, Where trees are eidolons and flowers have eyes, That I saw her pale face like the foam of far streams, And heard, like the night-wind, her tears and her sighs. It was last Hallowe'en, the haunted, the dread, In the wind-tattered wood, by the storm-twisted pine, That I, who am living, kept tryst with the dead, And clasped her a moment who once had been mine. ANSWERED Do you remember how that night drew on? That night of sorrow, when the stars looked wan As eyes that gaze, reproachful, in a dream; Loved eyes, long dead, and sadder than the grave? How through the heaven stole the moon's gray gleam, Like a nun's ghost down a cathedral's nave?â Do you remember how that night drew on? Do you remember the hard words then said? The words of hate above my bowed-down head, That left me dead, long, long before I died: Those words, whose bitterness had stabbed and slain My heart before I knew your love had lied, Or pierced me with the dagger of disdain.â Do you remember the hard words then said? Do you remember?ânow the night draws down,â As on that night,âthe heavens, lightnings crown With wrecks of thunder; and the moon doth give The clouds wild witchery,âas in a room, Behind the sorrowful arras, still may live The pallid secret of the haunted gloom.â Do you remember, now the night draws down? Do you remember, now it comes to pass Your form is bowed as is the wind-swept grass? And death hath won from you that confidence Denied to life? now your sick soul rebels Against your pride with tragic eloquence, That self-crowned demon of the heart's fierce hells.â Do you remember, now it comes to pass? Yea, you remember! Bid your soul be still! Here passion hath surrendered unto will, And flesh to spirit. Quiet your wild tongue And wilder heart. Your kiss wakes naught in me. The instrument love gave you lies unstrung, Silent, forsaken of all melody.â Yea, you remember! Bid your soul be still! UNFULFILLED In my dream last night it seemed I stood With a boy's glad heart in my boyhood's wood. The beryl green and the cairngorm brown Of the day through the deep leaves sifted down. The rippling drip of a passing shower Rinsed wild aroma from herb and flower. The splash and urge of a waterfall Spread stairwayed rocks with a crystal caul. And I waded the strip of the creek's dry bed For the colored keel and the arrow-head. And I found the cohosh coigne the same Tossing with torches of pearly flame. The owlet dingle of vine and brier, That the butterfly-weed flecked fierce with fire. The elder bosk with its warm perfume, And the yellow stars of the daisy bloom; The moss, the fern, and the touch-me-not I breathed, and the mint-smell keen and hot. And I saw the bird, that sang its best, In the tufted sumac building its nest. And I saw the chipmunk's stealthy face, And the rabbit crouched in a grassy place. And I watched the crows, that cawed and cried, Harrying the hawk at the forest-side; The bees that sucked in the blossoms slim, And the wasps that built on the lichened limb. And felt the silence, the dusk, the dread Of the spot where they buried the unknown dead: The water-murmur, the insect hum, And a far bird calling, âCome, oh, come!ââ No sweeter music can mortals make To ease the heart of its human ache!â And it seemed in my dream,âthat was all too true,â That I met in the woods again with you. A sun-tanned face and brown bare knees, And hands stained red with dewberries. And we stopped a moment some word to tell, And then in the woods we kissed farewell. But once I met you; yet, lo! it seems Again and again we meet in dreams. And I ask my soul what it all may mean: If this is the love that should have been. And oft and often I wonder, Can What Fate intends be changed by man? DIRGE What shall her dreaming keep Under the sun? Here where the willows weep And waters run; Here where she lies asleep And all is done. Lights, when the tree-top swings; Scents that are blown; Sounds of the wood-bird's wings; And the bee's drone; These be her comfortings Round her headstone. What shall watch o'er her here When day is fled? Here when the night is near And skies are red; Here where she lieth dear And young and dead. Shadows, and winds that spill Dew; and the rune Of the wild whippoorwill; And the white moon; These be the watchers still Round her headstone. REST Under the brindled beech, Deep in the mottled shade, Where the rocks hang in reach Flower and ferny blade, Let him be laid. Here will the brooks that rove Under the mossy trees,â Grave with the music of Underworld melodies,â Lap him in peace. Here will the winds, that blow Out of the haunted west,â Gold with the dreams that glow There on the heaven's breast,â Lull him to rest. Here will the stars and moon, Silent and far and deep,â Old with the mystic rune Of the slow years that creep,â Charm him with sleep. Under the ancient beech, Deep in the quiet shade,â Where the wood's peace may reach Him, as each bough is swayed,â Let him be laid. CLAIRVOYANCE The sunlight, that makes of the heaven A pathway for sylphids to throng; The wind, that makes harps of the forests For spirits to smite into song, Are the image and voice of a vision That comforts the heart and makes strong. I look in one's face, and the shadows Are lifted; and, lo, I can see, Through windows of evident being,â Filled full of eternity,â The form of the essence of Beauty God garments with mystery. I hearken one's voice, and the wrangle Of living hath pause: and I hear, Through doors of invisible spirit,â Filled full of God's light that is clear,â The radiant raiment of Music, In the hush of the heavens, sweep near. THE IDEAL Nor time nor all his minions Of sorrow and of pain, Shall dash with vulture pinions The cup she fills again Within the dream-dominions Of life where she doth reign. Clothed on with bright desire And hope that makes her strong, With limbs of frost and fire, She sits above all wrong, Her heart a living lyre, And love its only song. And in the waking pauses Of weariness and care, And when the dark hour draws his Black dagger of despair, Above effects and causes I hear her music there. The longings life hath near it Of beauty we would see; The dreams it doth inherit Of immortality; Are callings of her spirit To something yet to be. TO ONE READING THE MORTE D'ARTHURE O daughter of our Southern sun, Sweet sister of each flower, Dost dream in terraced Avalon A shadow-haunted hour? Or stand with Guinevere upon Some ivied Camelot tower? Or, in the wind, dost breathe the musk That blows Tintagel's sea on? Or 'mid the lists by castled Usk Hear some wild tourney's glee on? Or 'neath the Merlin moons of dusk Dost muse in old Caerleon? Or now of Launcelot, and then Of Arthur, 'mid the roses, Dost speak with wily Vivien? Or, where the shade reposes, Dost walk with stately, armored men In marble-fountained closes? So speak the dreams within thy gaze, The dreams thy spirit cages, Would that Romanceâwhich on thee lays The spell of bygone agesâ Held me! a memory of those days, A portion of those pages. THE CROSS The cross I bear no man shall knowâ No man shall see the cross I bear!â Alas! the thorny path of woe Up the steep hill of care! There is no word to comfort me; No sign to ease my cross-bowed head: Deep night is in the heart of me, And in my soul is dread. To strive, it seems, that I was born, For that which others shall obtain; The disappointment and the scorn Alone for me remain. One half my life is overpast; The other half I contemplateâ Meseems the past doth but forecast A darker future state. Sick to the heart of that which makes Me hope and struggle and desire, The aspiration here that aches With ineffectual fire: While inwardly I know the lack Of thought, the paucity of power, Each past day's retrospect makes black Each onward-coming hour. Now in my youth would I could die! Would God that I could lay me down And pass away without a sigh, Oblivious of renown! NIGHTFALL O day, so sicklied o'er with night! O dreadful fruit of fallen dusk!â A Circe orange, golden-bright, With horror 'neath its husk.â And I, who gave the promise heed That made life's tempting surface fair, Have I not eaten to the seed Its ashes of despair! O silence of the drifted grass! And immemorial eloquence Of stars and winds and waves that pass! And God's indifference! Leave me alone with sleep that knows Not anything that life may keepâ Not e'en the pulse that comes and goes In germs that climb and creep. Or if an aspiration pale Must quicken thereâoh, let the spot Grow weeds! that dust may so prevail Where spirit once could not! PAUSE Thou too art sick of dreams, that stain The aisle, along which life must pass, With hues of mystic-colored glass, That fills the windows of the brain. Thou too art sick of thoughts, that carve The house of days with arabesques And gargoyles, where the mind grotesques In masks of hope and faith who starve. Come, lay thy over-weary head Upon my bosom! Do not weep!â âHe giveth His beloved sleep.ââ Heart of my heart, be comforted. ABOVE THE VALES We went by ways of bygone days, Up mountain heights of story, Where, lost in vague, historic haze, Tradition, crowned with battle-bays, Sat 'mid her ruins hoary. Where, wing to wing, the eagles cling And torrents have their sources, War rose with bugle voice to sing Of woods of spears and swords a-swing, And rush of men and horses. Then deep below, where orchards show A home here, there a steeple, We heard a simple shepherd go, Singing,âwithin the afterglow,â A love-song of the people. As 'mid the trees his song did cease, With voice most sweet and holy, Peace,â'mid the cornlands of increase And rose-beds of love's victories,â Took up his music lowly. INSOMNIA It seems that dawn will never climb The eastern hills; And, clad in mist and flame and rime, Make flashing highways of the rills. The night is as an ancient way Through some dead land, Whereon the ghosts of Memory And Sorrow wander, hand in hand. By which man's works ignoble seem, Unbeautiful; And grandeur, but the ruined dream Of some dead queen, crowned with a skull. A way, Past-peopled, dark and old, That stretches farâ Its only real thing, the cold Vague light of Sleep's one fitful star. ENCOURAGEMENT To help our tired hope to toil, Lo! have we not the council here Of trees, that to my heart appear As sermons of the soil? To help our flagging faith to rise, Lo! have we not the high advice Of stars, that for my soul suffice As gospels of the skies? Sustain us, Lord! and help us climb, With hope and faith made strong and great, The rock-rough pathway of our fate, The care-dark way of time. WHICH? The wind was on the forest, And silence on the wold; And darkness on the waters, And heaven was starry cold; When Sleep, with all her magic, Made me this thing behold: This side, an iron woodland; That side, an iron waste; Between which rose a tower, Wherein a wan light paced, A light, or phantom woman Ice-eyed and icy-faced. And through the iron tower Of silence and of night, My Soul and I went only, My Soul, whose face was white, Whose one hand signed me listen, One bore a taper-light. For, lo! a voice behind me Kept sighing in my ear The dreams my mind accepted, My heart refused to hearâ Of one I loved and loved not, Whose spirit now was near, And, lo! a voice before me Kept calling constantly The hopes my heart accepted, My mind refused to seeâ Of one I loved and loved not, Whose spirit spake to me. This way the one would bid me; This way the other saith:â Sweet is the voice behind me Of Life that followeth; And sweet the voice before me Of Life whose name is Death. STORM I looked into the night and saw God writing with tumultuous flame Upon the thunder's front of awe,â As on sonorous brass,âthe Law, Terrific, of His judgment name. Weary of all life's best and worst, With hands of hate, Iâwho had pled, I, who had prayed for death at first And had not diedânow stood and cursed God, yet He would not strike me dead. TIME AND DEATH AND LOVE Last night I watched for Deathâ So sick of life was I!â When, in the street beneath, I heard his watchman cry The hour, while passing by. I called. And in the night I heard him stop below, His owlish lanthorn's light Blurring the windy snowâ How long the time and slow! I said, âWhy dost thou cower There at my door and knock? Come in! It is the hour! Cease fumbling at the lock! Naught's well! 'T is no o'clock!â Black through the door with him Swept in the Winter's breath; His cloak was great and grimâ But he who smiled beneath Had the face of Love not Death. A PHANTASY I know not where I found you With your wild hair a-blow, Nor why the world around you Would never let me know: Perhaps 't was Heaven relented; Perhaps 't was Hell resented My hope, and grimly vented Its hate upon me so. In Shadowland I met you Where all life's shadows meet; Within my heart I set you, A woman bitter-sweet: No hope for me to win you, Though I with soul and sinew Strove on and on, when in you There was no heart or heat. Still always, aye, and ever, Although I knew you lied, I followed on, but never Would your fair form abide: With loving arms stretched meward, As Sirens beckon seaward To some frail vessel leeward, Before me you would glide. But like an evil fairy, That mocks one with a light, Now near, you led your airy, Now far, your fitful flight: With red-gold tresses blowing, And eyes of sapphire glowing, With raiment white and flowing, You lured me through the night. To some unearthly revel Of mimes, a motley crew, 'Twixt Angel-land and Devil-, You lured me on, I knew, And lure me still! soft whiling The way with hopes beguiling, While dark Despair sits smiling Behind the eyes of you. WHEREFORE I would not see, yet must behold The lie they preach in church and hall; And question thus,âIs death then all, And life an idle tale that 's told? The myriad wonders art hath wrought Men deem eternal as God's love: No more than shadows these shall prove, And insubstantial, too, as thought. And love and labor, who have gone, Hand in close hand, and civilized The wilderness, these shall be prized No more than if they had not done. Then wherefore strive? Why strain and bend Beneath a burden so unjustâ Our works are builded of the dust, And dust our universal end. TRISTRAM AND ISOLT Night, and vast caverns of rock and of iron: Voices like water, and voices like wind: Horror, and tempests of hail that environ Shapes and the shadows of two who have sinned. Wan on the whirlwind, in loathing uplifting Faces that loved once, forever they go, Tristram and Isolt, the lovers, go drifting, The simmer and laughter of Hell below. NIGHT Lo! where the champion, Day, down slopes of flame, In golden armor, quits the evening skies! And as his glowing steeds, with manes of fire, Rush from the world, a dust of glimmering gold From their fierce hoofs o'er heaven's azure meads Rolls to one star that blossoms near the moon. With solemn tread and holy-stoled, star-bound, Night, like a votaress, a shadowy nun, Paces the lonely corridors of heaven, The vasty-arched and ebon halls of sky. How still! how beautiful! her raven locks Pale-filleted with stars that dance their sheen On her deep, vestal eyes, and woo the soul To wonder, and to dream of far-off things. How calm o'er this great river, in its flow Silent and dark, smoothes Earth's cold sister sphere Her lunar chasteness, whiter than blown foam! As o'er a troubled brow a hand of love: As on a restless heart the balm of sleep, Caressing softening all care away. See, where the roses, at the wood's dark edge, In many a languid bloom, bow to the moon And the dim river's lisp; sleep weighs their eyes With damask lashes of deep petals fringed, That the rude, frolic bee,ârough paramour,â So often kissed beneath the noonday sun. How cool the breezes touch the tired head! As if with unseen fingers, soft and slow, Smoothing away the weariness of day. And on the breeze, hark! to that melody, Borne from that thorn-tree, white with fragrant bloom, The dreaming nocturne of a mocking-bird,â Ave Maria, nun-like, slumbering sung,â There on its couch of clustered snow and scent. See, where the violet mound nods many a flower! Dreamily sad as Sorrow's own sad eyes, And lost in thought, and great with dewy grief, As are her eyes when haltingly she bends O'er Lethe's waves, and, stooping down to drink, Delays to drink, and faltering remains. The Night with feet of moon-tinged mist and wind Swept o'er them now, but as she passed she bent, Meseemed, and kissed each modest bloom and left A brilliant on its brow, that bashful hung, Freighted with love: then, groping up her train Of star-stained crape, that billowed breeze-like by, I seemed to hear her whisper as she passed: âSleep, sleep, my children! Lo, I bring to you God's best gift, sleep! the soft, the misty eyed; The strange, the wonderful! the cure for care!â And all things slept, the trees, the rocks, the soil, Sleep's soft ablution in them washing out The fever and the frenzy of the day: But I, I slept not with them, though the world And all its peoples slept, I could not sleep, My heart being brimmed with love, with joy and love, With thoughts and dreams of love's first happiness; Until the Night turned from the slumbering world, From her dim vigil turned,âas, from her child, A loving mother turns, who, all night long, Hath bent above its cradle, and with songs And kisses soothed to rest:âand in the east The first faint streaks of dawn made gray the heaven, And the rathe cock, like some clear clarion, crew. DAWN I Mist on the mountain height Silverly creeping: Incarnate beads of light Bloom-cradled sleeping, Dripped from the brow of Night. II Shadows and winds that rise Over the mountain: Stars in the spar that lies Lost in the fountain, Cold as the waking skies. III Sheep in the fenced-in folds Dreamily bleating, Dim on the thistled wolds, Where, glad with meeting, Twilight the Night enfolds. IV Sleep on the restless sea Hushing its trouble: Rest on the dreams that be Hued in Life's bubble: Calm on the heart of me. V Mist from the mountain height Hurriedly fleeting: Star in the locks of Night Throbbing and beating, Thrilled with the coming light. VI Flocks on the musky strips; Pearl on the fountain: Winds from the heavens' lips; And, on the mountain, Dawn with her rose that drips. THE OCKLAWAHA River, winding from the west, Winding from the River May, Often hath the Indian pressed Through your black-gums and your mosses, Where the alligator crosses Still some lily-paven bay, Basking there in lazy rest. Still the spider-lily loops Sprawling flowers, peels of pearl, Where the green magnolia stoops Buds to yellow-lily bonnets; Where, the morning dew upon its Golden funnels, curl on curl, The festooning jasmine droops. Who may paint the beauty of Orchids blooming late in June, Bristling on the boughs above! Cypress trees where vine and flower, Long, liana'd blossoms shower On the deer that come at noon To the inlets that they love. Lilied inlets,âwhere the teal Dabble 'mid the water-grasses,â That some treasure seem to seal With white blooms that star the river: Bays, the swift kingfishers shiver Into circles as each passes O'er their mirrors that reveal. Bends, reflecting root and moss, Where the tall palmettos throng 'Mid the live-oaks; tower and toss Panther necks whose heads are heavy: Hamaks, where the perfumes levy Tribute from the birds in song, From the mocking-birds that cross. Logs, the turtles haunt; and deeps Of lagoons the searching crane Wades; and where the heron sleeps; Where the screaming limpkins listen, And the leaping mullet glisten; Where the bream and bass show plain, And the dark didapper sweeps. CoÃ¤coochee! CoÃ¤coochee! Still your loved magnolias bloom, Still the tangled Cherokee; Still the blazing-star spreads splendor Through the forest, and the tender Discs of the hibiscus loom, Rosy, where you once roamed free. Osceola! Osceola! Phantoms of your vanquished race Seem around me: overawe All my soul here. Mossy regions Swarm with Seminoles: lost legions Rise, the war-paint on each faceâ Dead, long dead for Florida! THE MINORCAN I The mocking-bird may sing Loud welcomes in the Spring; The farewell of our nightingales Prevails, prevails! No thing may hush their song: In sleep they sing the clearerâ It 's âhome, home, home,â the whole night longâ What wonder that we feel our wrong The nearer! II Hibiscus blooms surprise The swamp with rosy eyes; The Balearic girl but knows Our rose, our rose! No slavery may undo Her dream it makes the purer, With âlove, love, love,â the long night through,â That makes the day's long heartbreak too The surer. III The wind from out the west Would teach our souls unrest; We will not hear until hath ceased The East, the East! Within its whispering sweep The olive sounds and rushes; It 's ârest, rest, rest,â while night doth keep The weight of memory asleep That crushes. IV Deep ocean brings us shells, Like dead but fond farewells, And calls to us with all its tongues of foam, âFrom home! from home!â And then the stars on high Look down and say, âCome, cherish Hope, hope, sweet hope,â our hearts deny Us while we toil all day and sigh, And perish. THE SPRING IN FLORIDA I Crab-apples make the western belt Of hamak one gay holiday of pink; And through palmetto deeps, on winds like felt, The jasmine odors sink. The wind blows blurs of peach and pearl Around the villa by the river's side; The guava blossoms and the orange-trees whirl Aroma far and wide. âHe courts her!â sings the mocking-bird; âHe courts her, and she misses This word, or that, she might have heard, Had he not crushed a sweeter word On her sweet mouth with kisses. He courts her.â II Chameleons haunt the sunlight there, Where lemons firmament with blooms the way: The white rose gives its soul up and the air Ensnares it in a ray. Great lilies open mouths of musk And stun the wind with scent; the loaded light Swoons with japonicas; and, tusk on tusk, Magnolias bud in sight. The red-bird sings, âOh, haste, haste, haste! Sweetheart! no longer tarry! Go, clasp her sweetly by the waist! And ask her, like a poppy faced, Sweetheart! if she will marry. Oh, haste, haste, haste!â III There the verandah, spilled and spun With deep bignonia, foaming all its frame With fiery blooms, seems pouring for the sun A cataract of flame. The oleander hedges soak The dusk with fragrance: and the gray moss sweeps Its streamers from the cypress and live-oak Where blue the ocean sleeps. âOh, love, love, love!â the wood-dove coos; âOh, love, love, love, for ever! They who the crimson rose refuse, All other flowers, too, may loseâ So choose thou now or never! Oh, love, love, love!â LONG AGO When the winter wind comes sighing Like a ghost, and softly trying Door and window, and the dying Light upon the hearth burns low; How his heart, that 's old, remembers Love that faded as the embers Into ashes, or December's Vanished snow. And he seems to see her sitting With the tranquil firelight flitting On her face and fitful knitting, While her chair goes to and fro; As she sat once in the hours That are gone; that, like the flowers, Died, with all that youth embowers, Long ago. Then he seems to hear her speaking, And her rocker faintly creaking, And his hand goes dimly seeking Hers that is not there, ah, no! Hers, whose memory keeps reaching From the past fond arms, beseeching Heart and soul till, past all preaching, Both o'erflow. Oh, caresses lost that take him In his dreams and wildly wake him! Tears that blind and sighs that shake him, Is there any cure for woe?â Answer, love, whose eyes once merried! Joy, whose cheeks and lips were cherried! You, whom long ago he buried, Long ago. SELF A Sufi said to me in dreams: Behold! from Sodomite to Peri Earth tablets us: man lives and is Man's own long commentary. Is one begat at Bassora, One lies at Damietta dyingâ The plausibilities of God All possibles o'erlying. But when lust burns within the fleshâ Hell 's but a homily on Heavenâ Put then the individual first, And of thyself be shriven. Neither in adamant nor brass The scrutinizing eye records it: The arm is rooted in the heart, The heart that rules and lords it. Be that it is and thou art all: And what thou art so hast thou written Thee of the lutanists of Love, Or of the torture-smitten. ASPIRATION God knew he strove against pale lust and vice, Wound in the net of their voluptuous hair: God knew that to their kisses he was ice, Their arms around him there. God knew against the front of fate he set A front as stern, with lips as sternly pressed; Raised clenched and ineffectual hands that met The iron of her breast. God knew what motive his sad soul inspired: God knew the star for which he climbed and craved: God knew, and only God, the hell that fired His heart and in it raved. And yet he failed! failed utterly!âNo lie Of Hell, that writhes within its simmering pit, Sank deeper down than he, who, with the cry, âNow shall I rest from it!â Died; was remembered, haply, for a day; Who hoped to rise rolled in the morning's rose, The flame of fame, and still lies laid away Where no one cares or knows. PEACE I When rose-leaves 'neath the rose-bush lie And lilies bloom and lilacs die, When days fall sadder than a sigh, Lay me asleep; Where breezes blow the rose-leaves by, Lay me asleep. II When to the dusty, dreary day No lonely cloud brings cooling gray, And languidly the tree-tops sway And flowers there, Come thou as silently and pray As flowers there. III Then pass as softly: shed no tear Nor flaw with sighs the peace that 's here; The pallid silence, far and near, So weary grown; Nor bring the world to jar the ear So weary grown. SIN There is a legend of an old Hartz tower That tells of one, a noble, who had sold His soul unto the Fiend; who grew not old On this condition: that the Demon's power Cease every midnight for a single hour, And, in that hour, his body should lie cold With limbs up-shriveled, and with face, behold! Shrunk to a death's-head in the taper's glower.â So unto Sin Life gives his best. Her arts Make all his outward seeming beautiful Before the world; but in his heart of hearts Abides an hour when her strength is null; When he shall feel the death through all his parts Strike, and his countenance become a skull. THE HOUSE OF FEAR Vast are its halls, as vast the halls and lone Where Death sits, listening to the wind and rain; And dark the house, where I shall meet again That long-dead Sin in some dread way unknown: For I have dreamed of stairs of haunted stone, And spectre footsteps I have fled in vain; And windows glaring with a blood-red stain, And hollow eyes, that burn me to the bone, Within a face that looks as that black night It looked when deep I dug for it a grave,â The dagger wound above the brow, the thin Blood trickling slantwise down the cheek's dead white;â And I have dreamed not even God can save Me and my soul from that arisen Sin. SATAN Still shall I stand the everlasting hate Colossal Chaos builded 'neath thine eyes, The symbol of all evil, that defies Thy victory, and, vanquished, still can wait. Scar me again with such vast flame as late Hurled abrupt thunder and archangel cries, 'Mid fiery whirlwinds of the terrible skies, Down the deep's roar against Hell's monster gate! Thy wrath can not abolish or make less Me, an eternal wile opposed to wrath: Me, who to thwart thee evermore shall plan! Behold thy Eden's vanished loveliness!â Why hast thou set a sword within its path, And cursed and exiled thine own image, Man? OSSIAN Long have I heard the noise of battle clash Along the windy sea that roared again; Seen helmets rise, and on the clanking plain Barbaric chieftains meet and, howling, dash Their mailÃ©d thousands down, with crash on crash, Like crags contending with the roaring main; Torrents of shields, like rivers of rolling rain, I have beheld within the moon's pale flash; The moon, that, like a spirit, o'er the wood Hung white as steel, glimmering the spears and swords, That shone like ripples in the iron flood, The streams of war, that beat in heathen hordes About their rock-like kings, whence wave-like far, Circled the battle, warrior on warrior. QUATRAINS I The Love Chase On, towards the purlieus of impossible space, From Death, enamoured, Life, capricious, flies: Communicated sorrow of his face Freezing her ever backward burning eyes. II The Garden of Days Man's days are planted as a flower-bed With labor's lily and the rose of folly: Beneath grief's cypress, pale, uncomforted, The phantom fungus blooms of melancholy. III Faith and Facts With starry gold Night still endorses what Man's soul hath written, guessing at the skies: Day on Night's scribble drops a fiery blot, And 'thwart the writing scrawls, âThe lie of lies.â IV Hell and Heaven And it may be that, seamed with iron scars, One in vast Hell oft lifts fierce eyes above, And one, inviolate as God's high stars, Looks from far Heaven, sighing: âAlas, O love!â V Alchemy Into her heart's young crucible Life threw Affliction first, then Faith,âby which is meant Hope and Humility:âLove touched the two, And, lo! the golden blessing of Content. VI Trial As oft as Hope weighed, coaxing, on this arm, On that Despair dashed heavily his fist: He knew no way out of Grief's night and storm, Until a child, named Effort, came and kissed. VII Nightmare Some obscene drug in her dull draught Sleep gave, For dead I lay, yet heard a man-faced beast Dig, dig with wolfish fingers in my grave, With horrible laughter to a horrible feast. VIII Clairvoyance Some few may pierce the phantom fogs, that veil Life's stormy seas, into futurity, And see the Flying Dutchman's ominous sail, Portentous of dark things that are to be. IX The Flying Dutchman Through hissing scud, mad mist, and roaring rain, On thundering seas, I see her drive and drive, Crowding wild canvas 'gainst the hurricane, Her demon ports with glow-worm lamps alive. X Destiny Within the volume of the universe With worlds she writes irrevocable laws: From everlasting unto everlasting hers The evolutions of effect and cause. XI Fame, the Mermaid A mirror, brilliant as a beautiful star, She lifts and sings to her own loveliness: Not till her light and song have lured him far Does man behold the lie he did not guess. XII The Hours With stars and dew and sunlight in their hair, They come, the daughters of the Day, who saith: âThe gifts my children bring are rest and care, Of which the last is Life, the first is Death.â XIII Despair So sick at heart, so weary of the sun, In her sad halls the Soul sits desolate, Her Hope surrendered to Oblivion, Whose coal-black charger neighs outside the gate. XIV The Misanthrope Shut in with its own selfishness his soul Sees,âas a screech-owl in a dead tree might, Blinking avoided daylight through one hole,â The white world blackened by his own dull sight. XV The Hun On splendid infamiesâa thousand years Heaven toleratedâlike a Word that trod Incarnate of the Law, vast wrath and tears In pagan eyes, behold the Scourge of God! XVI Greece The godlike sister of all lands she stands Before the World, to whom she gave her heart, Still testifying with degenerate hands Her bygone glory in enduring art. XVII Egypt With ages weighed as with the pyramids And Karnac wrecks, stillâout of Sphinx-like eyes Beneath the apathetic lotus-lidsâ With Memnon moan her granite heart defies. XVIII Poe Wild wandering witch-lights and, dark-wing'd above, A raven; and, within a sculptured tomb, Beside the corpse of Beauty and of Love, Song's everlasting-lamp that lights the gloom. XIX Hawthorne Dim lands and dimmer walls, where Magic slips A couch of velvet sleep beneath Romance: Where Speculation, Prince-like, kneels; his lips Fearing to break the long-unbroken trance. XX Emerson Our New-World Chrysostom, whose golden tongue Through Nature preached philosophy and truth: Old intimate of loveliness he sung, Wise and instructing with the lips of youth. XXI Jaafer the Vizier Lutes, odorous torches, slaves and dancing girls In gardens by a moonlit waterside, And one whose wise lips scatter words like pearlsâ Behold the true Haroun whom naught may hide! THE PURITANS' CHRISTMAS Their only thought religion, What Christmas joys had they, The stern, staunch Pilgrim Fathers who Knew never a holiday?â A log-church in the clearing 'Mid solitudes of snow, The wild-beast and the wilderness, And lurking Indian foe. No time had they for pleasure, Whom God had put to school; A sermon was their Christmas cheer, A psalm their only Yule. They deemed it joy sufficient,â Nor would Christ take it ill,â That service to himself and God Employed their spirits still. And so through faith and prayer Their powers were renewed, And hearts made strong to hew a world, And tame a solitude. A type of revolution, Wrought from an iron plan, In the largest mold of liberty God cast the Puritan. A better land they founded, That Freedom had for bride, The shackles of old despotism Struck from her limbs and side. With faith within to guide them, And courage to perform, A nation, from a wilderness, They hewed with their strong arm. For liberty to worship, And right to do and dare, They faced the savage and the storm With voices raised in prayer. For God it was who summoned, And God it was who led, And God would not forsake the love That must be clothed and fed. Great need had they of courage! Great need of faith had they! And, lacking these,âhow otherwise For us had been this day! THE NEW YEAR Lift up thy torch, O Year, and let us see What Destiny Hath made thee heir to, at nativity!â Doubt, some call Faith; and ancient Wrong and Might, Whom some name Right; And Darkness, that the purblind world calls Light. Despair, with Hope's brave form; and Hate, who goes In Friendship's clothes; And Joy, the smiling mask of many woes. Neglect, whom Merit serves; Lust, to whom, see, Love bends the knee; And Selfishness, who preacheth charity. Vice, in whose dungeon Virtue lies in chains; And Cares and Pains, That on the throne of Pleasure hold their reigns. Corruption, known as Honesty; and Fame That 's but a name; And Innocence, whose other name is Shame. And Folly men call Wisdom here, forsooth; And, like a youth, Fair Falsehood, whom the many take for Truth. Abundance, who hath Famine's house in lease; And, high 'mid these, War, blood-black, on the spotless shrine of Peace. Lift up thy torch, O Year! make clear our sight! Deep lies the night Around us, and God grants us little light! THE POET OF THE SIERRAS How shall I greet himâhim who seems To me the greatest of our singers? As one who hears Sierra streams, And, gazing under arching fingers, Feels all the eagle feels that screams, The savage dreams, what time he lingers? Son of the West, out of the West We heard thee sing,âwho still allurest,â That land where God sits manifest; That land where man stands freest, surest; That land, our wildest and our best, The grandest and the purest. Wild has thou sung,âas some strange bird,â Of gold and men and peaks that glistened, Of seas and stars, and we have heardâ And one, whose soul cried out and listened, He sends his young, unworthy word To thee the Master's hand hath christened AMERICA Behold her stand, with power thunder-lipped, And eagle-thoughts that soar above the storm Convulsing ledges of the mountain Wrong! Beside her Liberty, whose sword is tipped With lightning, towering a majestic form, Her voice like battle in a freedom song. America, what hates may soil thy hands? What kingdoms face with insult thy bold brow? Oppressions brave the anger in thine eyes?â Behind thee dies the darkness from the lands: Before thee mounts the glory of the Now: Around thee sit the sessions of the skies. Thine is the land where Progress leans to heed The lessons taught of Heaven and of God, The golden texts of morning and of night: The science of thy soul hath taught thee speed! No precedent of Nations makes thee nod! Brow-bound with bolts, thy feet are shod with light. America, beneath thy iron heel What Old World tyrannies, that crushed the poor, Writhe out their lives, abolished in their ire! Around thine arms, wrapped strong in fourfold steel, What Old World injuries have failed to moor Barques thou hast beaconed like a pillared fire! Thou speakest, and Oppression's mists divide; And gyves of Superstition and of Lust Fall shattered from the World; and Truth and Love Assume their places, beautiful in pride: And stars spring up around them from the dust, The dust of hopes long fallen from above. Onward thou movest: where thy steps are bent The Earth is civilized: the desert plain Blossomsâis citied with vast industry.â Behold! the pagan, Violence, is spent! His idol, Ignorance, is rent in twain Before thy splendor that makes all men free. âTHE FATHERS OF OUR FATHERSâ Written February 24, 1898, on reading the latest news concerning the battleship Maine, blown up in Havana Harbor, February fifteenth. I The fathers of our fathers, they were men!â What are we who now stand idle while we see our seamen slain? Who behold our flag dishonored, and still pause! Are we blind to her duplicity, the treachery of Spain? To the rights, she scorns, of nations and their laws? Let us rise, a mighty people, let us wipe away the stain! Shall we wait till she defile us for a cause?â The fathers of our fathers, they were men! II The fathers of our fathers, they were men!â Had they nursed delay as we do? had they sat thus deaf and dumb, With these cowards compromising year by year? Never hearing what they should hear, never saying what should come, While the courteous mask of Spain still hid a sneer! No! such news had 'roused their natures like a rolling battle-drumâ God of Earth! and God of Battles! do we fear?â The fathers of our fathers, they were men! III The fathers of our fathers, they were men!â What are we who are so cautious, never venturing too far! Shall we, at the cost of honor, still keep peace? While we see the thousands starving and the struggling Cuban star, And the outraged form of Freedom on her knees! Let our long, steel ocean-bloodhounds, adamantine dogs of war, Sweep the yellow Spanish panther from the seas!â The fathers of our fathers, they were men! MENE TEKEL UPHARSIN I Behold! we have gathered together our battleships near and afar; Their decks, they are cleared for action; their guns, they are shotted for war: From the East to the West there is hurry; in the North and the South a peal Of hammers in fort and shipyard, and the clamor and clang of steel; And the roar and the rush of engines, and clanking of derrick and craneâ Thou art weighed in the Scales and found wanting! the balance of God, O Spain! II Behold! I have stood on the mountains, and this was writ in the sky:â âShe is weighed in the Scales and found wanting! the balance God holds on high!â The balance he once weighed Babylon, the Mother of Harlots, in: One scale holds thy pride and thy power and empire, begotten of sin; Heavy with woe and torture, the crimes of a thousand years, Mortared and welded together with fire and blood and tears: In the other, for justice and mercy, a blade with never a stain, Is laid the Sword of Liberty, and the balance dips, O Spain! III Summon thy vessels together! great is thy need for these!â Cristobal Colon, Vizcaya, Oquendo, and Maria Tereseâ Let them be strong and many, for a vision I had by night, That the ancient wrongs thou hast done the world came howling to the fight: From the New-World's shores they gathered, Inca and Aztec slain, To the Cuban shot but yesterday, and our own dead seamen, Spain! IV Summon thy ships together, gather a mighty fleet! For a strong, young Nation is arming, that never hath known defeat. Summon thy ships together, there by thy blood-stained sands! For a shadowy army gathers with manacled feet and hands; A shadowy host of sorrows and shames, too black to tell, That reach, with their horrible wounds, for thee to drag thee down to Hell: A myriad phantoms and spectres, thou warrest against in vainâ Thou art weighed in the Scales and found wanting! the balance of God, O Spain! May, 1898. UNDER THE STARS AND STRIPES I High on the world did our fathers of old, Under the Stars and Stripes, Blazon the name that we now must uphold, Under the Stars and Stripes. Vast in the past they have builded an arch, Over which Freedom has lighted her torchâ Follow it! follow it! come, let us march Under the Stars and Stripes! II We in whose bodies the blood of these runs, Under the Stars and Stripes, We will acquit us as sons of their sons, Under the Stars and Stripes. Ever for justice, our heel upon wrong, We in the might of our vengeance thrice strongâ Rally together! come marching along Under the Stars and Stripes! III Out of our strength and a nation's great need, Under the Stars and Stripes, Heroes again as of old we shall breed, Under the Stars and Stripes. Broad to the winds be our banner unfurled! Straight from our guns let defiance be hurled! God on our side, we will battle the world, Under the Stars and Stripes! May, 1898. OUR CAUSE I Lord God, who mad'st Spain's vessels melt Before the flame our squadrons dealt, And Santiago's mountain belt Rock near and far With thunder of our ships of steel, Keep us still humble! help us kneel In prayer with hearts as great to heal, As strong in war! II When turret booms to turret; when The steam goes up of battle, then Lord God, we pray Thee, keep our men Till all is o'er: Should pride of conquest then mislead Our House and Senate, Lord, we plead Keep Thou our cause as clean of greed As 'twas before. III And when the batteries there of Spain, From shore and headland, hurricane Their roaring sleet and crashing rain Of shell and shot; When drums beat up and bugles blow, And rank on rank we face the foe, In life and death, in joy and woe, Forget us not. IV Not for ourselves we pray to Thee; But for the cause of liberty, Lord God!âLet old Oppression see How o'er her coasts Our Eagle's fierce, majestic form Soars through the lightning and the storm Beneath thy all protecting arm, Lord God of Hosts! July 4th, 1898. AFTERWORD The old enthusiasms Are dead, quite dead, in me; Dead the aspiring spasms Of art and poesy, That opened magic chasms, Once, of wild mystery, In youth's rich Araby, Aladdin-wondrous chasms. The longing and the care Are mine; and, helplessly, The heartache and despair For what can never be. More than my mortal share Of sad mortality, It seems, God gives to me, More than my mortal share. O world! O time! O fate! Remorseless trinity! Let not your wheel abate Its iron rotary!â Turn round! nor make me wait, Bound to it neck and knee, Hope's final agony!â Turn round! nor make me wait. [POEMS OF FOREST AND FIELD] PROEM They took him into confidenceâeach oak Of the far forest: and all day he sat Hearing of Nature from an autocrat, An oakâso old, Dodona might have spoke Its infant oracles through it; that, part Of the oracular beauty of the gods, Yet irresponsible, down in its heart Still felt the rapture of their periods. They took him into confidenceâthe skies: And all night long he lay beneath one star, Hearing of God. . . . One that was chorister At Earth's first morning; that beheld fierce eyes Of rebel angels, and the birth of Hell; Whom God set over Eden and o'er them, The Two, as destiny; that did foretell How Christ lay born at far-off Bethlehem. THE HYLAS I I heard the hylas in the bottomlands Piping a reed-note in the praise of Spring: The South-wind brought the music on its wing, As 't were a hundred strands Of guttural gold smitten of elfin hands; Or of sonorous silver, struck by bands, Anviled within the earth, Of laboring gnomes shaping some gem of worth. Sounds that seemed to bid The wildflowers wake; Unclose each dewy lid, And starrily shake Sleep from their airy eyes Beneath the loam, And, robed in dÃ¦dal dyes, Frail as the fluttering foam, In countless myriads rise. And in my city home I, too, who heard Their reedy word, Awoke, and, with my soul, went forth to roam. II And under glimpses of the cloud-white sky My soul and I Beheld her seated, Spring among the woods With bright attendants, Two radiant maidens, The Wind and Sun: one robed in cadence, And one in white resplendence, Working wild wonders with the solitudes. And thus it was, So it seemed to me, Where she sat apart Fondling a bee, By some strange art, As in a glass, Down in her heart My eyes could see What would come to pass:â How in each tree, Each blade of grass,â Dead though it seemed,â Still lived and dreamed Life and perfume, Color and bloom, Housed from the North Like golden mirth, That she with jubilation would bring forth, Astonishing Earth. III And thus it was I knew That though the trees were barren of all buds, And all the woods Of blossoms now, still, still their hoods And heads of blue and gold, And pink and pearl lay hidden in the mould; And in a day or two, When Spring's fair feet came twinkling through The trees, their gold and blue, And pearl and pink in countless bands would rise, Invading all these ways With loveliness; and to the skies, In radiant rapture raise The fragile sweetness of a thousand eyes. When every foot of soil would boast An ambuscade Of blossoms; each green rood parade Its flowery host; And every acre of the woods, With little bird-like beaks of leaves and buds, Brag of its beauty; making bankrupts of Our hearts of praise, and beggar us of love. IV Here, when the snow was flying, And barren boughs were sighing, In icy January, I stood, like some gray tree, lonely and solitary. Now every spine and splinter Of wood, washed clean of winter, By hill and canyon Makes of itself an intimate companion, A confidant, who whispers me the dreams That haunt its heart, and clothe it as with gleams. And lonely now no more I walk the mossy floor Of woodlands where each bourgeoning leaf is matched, Mated with music; triumphed o'er Of building love and nestling song just hatched. V Washed of the early rains, And rosed with ruddy stains, The boughs and branches now make ready for Their raiment green of leaves and musk and myrrh.â As if to greet her pomp, The heralds of her state, As 't were with many a silvery trump, The birds are singing, singing, And all the world's elate, As o'er the hills, as 't were from Heaven's gate, With garments, dewy-clinging, Comes Spring, around whose way the budded woods are ringing With redbird and with bluebird and with thrush; While, overhead, on happy wings is swinging The swallow through the heaven's azure hush: And wren and sparrow, vireo and crow Are busy with their nests, or high or low, In every tree, it seems, and every bush. The loamy odor of the turfy heat, Breathed warm from every field and wood-retreat, Is as if spirits passed on flowery feet:â That indescribable Aroma of the woods one knows so well, Reminding one of sylvan presences, Clad on with lichen and with moss, That haunt and trail across The woods' dim dales and dells; their airy essences Of racy nard and musk Rapping at gummy husk And honeyed sheath of every leaf and flower That open to their knock, each at the appointed hour:â And, lo! Where'er they go, Behold a miracle Too beautiful to tell!â Where late the woods were bare The red-bud shakes its hair Of flowering flame; the dogwood and the haw Voluble with bees dazzle with pearl the shaw; And the broad maple crimsons, sunset-red, Through firmaments of forest overhead: And of its boughs the wild-crab makes a lair, A rosy cloud of blossoms, for the bees, Bewildered there, To traffic in; lulling itself with these. And in the whispering woods The wild-flower multitudes Rise, star, and bell, and bugle, all amort To everything save their own loveliness And the soft wind's caress,â The wind that tip-toes through them:âliverwort, Spring-beauty, windflower and the bleeding-heart, And bloodroot, holding low Its cups of stainless snow; Sorrel and trillium and the twin-leaf, too, Twinkling, like stars, through dew: And patches, as it were, of saffron skies, Ranunculus; and golden eyes Of adder's-tongue; and mines, It seems, of grottoed gold, the poppy-celandines; And, sapphire-spilled, Bluets and violets, Dark pansy-violets and columbines, With rainy radiance filled; And many more whose names my mind forgets, But not my heart: The Nations of the Flowers, making gay In every place and part, With pomp and pageantry Of absolute Beauty, all the worlds of woods, In congregated multitudes, Assembled where Unearthly colors all the oaks put on, Velvet and silk and vair, Vermeil and mauve and fawn, Dim and auroral as the hues of dawn. WIND AND CLOUD A March Voluntary I Winds that cavern heaven and the clouds And canyon with cerulean blue,â Great rifts down which the stormy sunlight crowds Like some bright seraph, who, Mailed in intensity of silver mail, Flashes his splendor over hill and vale,â Now tramp, tremendous, the loud forest through: Or now, like mighty runners in a race, That swing, long pace to pace, Sweep round the hills, fresh as, at dawn's first start, They swept, dew-dripping, from The crystal-crimson ruby of her heart, Shouting the dim world dumb. And with their passage the gray and green Of the earth 's washed clean; And the cleansing breath of their might is wings And warm aroma we know as Spring's, And sap and strength to her bourgeonings. II My brow I bare To the cool, clean air, That blows from the crests of the clouds that roll, Pearl-piled and berged as floes of Northern Seas, Banked gray and thunder-low Big in the heaven's peace; Clouds, borne from nowhere that we know, With nowhere for their goal; With here and there a silvery glow Of sunlight chasming deeps of sombre snow, Great gulfs that overflow With sky, a sapphire-blue, Or opal, sapphire-kissed, Wide-welled and deep and swiftly rifting through Stratas of streaming mist;â Each opening like a pool, Serene, cerule, Set round with crag-like clouds 'mid which its eye gleams cool. III What blue is bluer than the bluebird's blue!â 'T is as if heaven itself sat on its wings; As if the sky in miniature it bore The fields and forests through, Bringing the very heaven to our door; The daybreak of its back soft-wedded to The sunset-auburn of its throat that sings.â The dithyrambics of the wind and rain Strive to, but can not, drown its strain: Again, and yet again I hear it where the maples tassel red, And blossoms of the crab round out o'erhead, And catkins make the willow-brake A gossamer blur around the lake That lately was a stream, A little stream locked in its icy dream. IV Invisible crystals of aÃ«rial ring, Against the wind I hear the bluebird fling Its notes; and where the oak's mauve leaves uncurl I catch the skyey glitter of its wing; Its wing that lures me, like some magic charm, Far in the woods And shadowy solitudes: And where the purple hills stretch under purple and pearl Of clouds that sweep and swirl, Its music seems to take material form; A form that beckons with cerulean arm And bids me see and follow, Where, in the violet hollow, There at the wood's far turn, On starry moss and fern, She shimmers, glimmering like a rainbowed shower, The Spirit of Spring, Diaphanous-limbed, who stands With honeysuckle hands Sowing the earth with many a firstling flower, Footed with fragrance of their blossoming, And clad in heaven as is the bluebird's wing. V The tumult and the booming of the trees, Shaken with shoutings of the winds of Marchâ No mightier music have I heard than these,â The rocking and the rushing of the trees, The organ-thunder of the forest's arch. And in the wind their columned trunks become, Each one, a mighty pendulum, Swayed to and fro as if in time To some vast song, some roaring rhyme, Wind-shouted from sonorous hill to hill. The woods are never still: The dead leaves frenzy by, Innumerable and frantic as the dance That whirled its madness once beneath the sky In ancient Greece,âlike withered Corybants: And I am caught and carried with their rush, Their countless panicâborne away, A brother to the wind, through the deep gray Of the old beech-wood, where the wild March-day Sits dreaming, filling all the boisterous hush With murmurous laughter and swift smiles of sun; Conspiring in its heart and plotting how To load with leaves and blossoms every bough, And whispering to itself, âNow Spring 's begun! And soon her flowers shall golden through these leaves!â Away, ye sightless things and sere! Make room for that which shall appear! The glory and the gladness of the year; The loveliness my eye alone perceives,â Still hidden there beneath the covering leaves,â My song shall waken!âflowers, that this floor Of whispering woodland soon shall carpet o'er For my sweet sisters' feet to tread upon, Months kinder than myself, the stern and strong, Tempestuous-loving one, Whose soul is full of wild, tumultuous song, And whose rough hand now thrusts itself among The dead leaves; groping for the flowers that lie Huddled beneath, each like a sleep-closed eye: Gold adder's-tongue and pink Oxalis; snow-pale bloodroot blooms; May-apple hoods, that parasol the brink, Screening their moons, of the slim woodland-stream: And the wild iris; trillium,âwhite as stars,â And bluebells, dream on dream: With harsh hand groping in the glooms, I grasp their slenderness and shake Their lovely eyes awake, Dispelling from their souls the sleep that mars; With heart-disturbing jars Clasping their forms, and with rude finger-tips, Through the dark rain that drips Lifting them shrinking to my stormy lips. VI âAlready spicewood and the sassafras, Like fragrant flames, begin To tuft their boughs with topaz, ere they spin Their beryl canopiesâa glimmering mass, Mist-blurred, above the deepening grass. Already where the old beech stands Clutching the lean soil as it were with hands Taloned and twisted,âon its trunk a knot, A huge excrescence, a great fungous clot, Like some enormous and distorting wart,â My eyes can see how, blot on beautiful blot Of blue, the violets blur through The musky and the loamy rot Of leaf-pierced leaves; and, heaven in their hue, A sunbeam at each blossom's heart, The little bluets, crew on azure crew, Prepare their myriads for invasion too. VII âAnd in my soul I see how, soon, shall rise,â Still hidden to men's eyes,â Dim as the wind that round them treads,â Hosts of spring-beauties, streaked with rosy reds, And pale anemones, whose airy heads, As to some fairy rhyme, All day shall nod in delicate time: And now, even now, white peal on peal Of pearly bells,âthat in bare boughs conceal Themselves,âlike snowy music, chime on chime, The huckleberries to my gaze revealâ Clusters, that soon shall toss Above this green-starred moss, That, like an emerald fire, gleams across This forest-side, and from its moist deeps lifts Slim, wire-like stems of seed; Or, lichen-colored, glows with many a bead Of cup-like blossoms: carpets where, I read, When through the night's dark rifts The moonlight's glimpsing splendor sifts, The immaterial forms With moonbeam-beckoning arms, Of Fable and Romance,â Myths that are born of whispers of the wind And foam of falling waters, music-twinnedâ Shall lead the legendary dance; The dance that never stops, Of Earth's wild beauty on the green hill-tops.â VIII The youth, the beauty and disdain Of birth, death does not know, Compel my heart with longing like to pain When the spring breezes blow. The fragrance and the heat Of their soft breath, whose musk makes sweet Each woodland way, each wild retreat, Seem saying in my ear, âHark, and behold! Before a week be gone This barren woodside and this leafless wold A million flowers shall invade With argent and azure, pearl and gold,â Like rainbow fragments scattered of the dawn,â Here making bright, here wan Each foot of earth, each glen and glimmering glade, Each rood of windy wood, Where late gaunt Winter stood, Shaggy with snow and howling at the sky; Where even now the Springtime seems afraid To whisper of the beauty she designs, The flowery campaign that she now outlines Within her soul; her heart's conspiracy To take the world with loveliness; defy And then o'erwhelm the Deathâthat Winter throned Amid the trees,âwith love that she hath owned Since God informed her from His very breath, Giving her right triumphant over Death. And, irresistible, Her heart's deep ecstasy shall swell, Taking the form of flower, leaf, and blade, Invading every dell, And sweeping, surge on surge, Around the world, like some exultant raid, Even to the heaven's verge. Soon shall her legions storm Death's ramparts, planting Life's fair standard there, The banner which her beauty hath in care, Beauty, that shall eventuate With all the pomp and pageant and the state, That are a part of power, and that wait On majesty, to which it, too, is heir.â IX Already bluish pink and green The bloodroot's buds and leaves are seen Clumped in dim cirques; one from the other Hardly distinguished in the shadowy smother Of last year's leaves blown brown between. And, piercing through the layers of dead leaves, The searching eye perceives The dog's-tooth violet, pointed needle-keen, Lifting its beak of mottled green; While near it heaves The May-apple its umbrous spike, a ball,â Like to a round, green bean, That folds its blossom,âtopping its tight-closed parasol: The clustered bluebell near Hollows its azure ear, Low-leaning to the earth as if to hear The sound of its own growing and perfume Flowing into its bloom: And softly there The twin-leaf's stems prepare Pale tapers of transparent white, As if to light The Spirit of Beauty through the wood's green night. X Why does Nature love the number five? Five-whorled leaves and five-tipped flowers?â Haply the bee i' the voluble rose, Laboring aye to store its hive, And humming away the long noon hours, Haply it knows as it comes and goes: Or haply the butterfly, Or moth of pansy-dye, Flitting from bloom to bloom In the forest's violet gloom, It knows why: Or the irised fly, to whom Each bud, as it glitters near, Lends eager and ardent ear.â And, also, tell Why Nature loves so well To prank her flowers in gold and blue. Haply the dew, That lies so close to them the whole night through, Hugged to each honeyed heart, Perhaps the dew the secret could impart: Or haply now the bluebird there that bears, Glad, unawares, God's sapphire on its wings, The lapis-lazuli O' the clean, clear sky, The heav'n of which he sings, Haply he, too, could tell me why: Or the maple there that swings, To the wind's soft sigh, Its winglets, crystal red, A rainy ruby twinkling overhead: Or haply now the wind, that breathes of rain Amid the rosy boughs, it could explain: And even now, in words of mystery,â That haunt the heart of me,â Low-whispered, dim and bland, Tells me, but tells in vain, And strives to make me see and understand, Delaying where The feldspar fire of the violet breaks, And the starred myrtle aches With heavenly blue; and the frail windflower shakes Its trembling tresses in the opal air. IN SOLITARY PLACES I The hurl and hurry of the winds of March, That tore the ash and bowed the pine and larch, And filled the night with rushings,âlike the crew Of the Wild Huntsman,âand the days with hue And cry of storm, soft in the heaven's porch Have laid them down:âloud winds, that trampled through The forests with enormous, scythe-like sweep, And from the darkened deep, The battlemented heavens, thunder-blue, Rumbled the arch, The rocking arch of all the booming oaks, With stormy chariot-spokes: Chariots, from which wild bugle-blasts they blew In warlike challenge. . . . Now the wind-flower sweet Misses the fury of their ruining feet, The trumpet-thunder of resistless flight, Crashing and vast, obliterating light; Sweeping the skeleton madness down Of last-year's leaves; and, overhead, Hurrying the giant foliage of night, Gaunt clouds that streamed with tempest. . . . Now each crown Of ancient woods, that clamored with their tread, The frenzy of their passage, stoops no more, Hearing no more their clarion-command, Their chariot-hurl and the wild whip in hand. No more, no more, The forests rock and roar And tumult with their shoutings. Hushed and still Is the green-gleaming and the sunlit hill, Along whose sides, Flushing the dewy moss and rainy grassâ Beneath the topaz-tinted sassafras, Pale, aromatic as some orient wineâ The violet fire of the bluet glides, The amaranthine flame Of sorrel and of bluebell runs; And through the drabs and duns Of rotting leaves, the moonÃ©d celandine, Line upon lovely line, Deliberate, goldens into birth: And, ruby and rose, the moccasin-flower hides: Innumerable flowers, with which she writes her name, April, upon the page, The winter-withered parchment of old earth; Her fragrant autograph, that gives it worth And loveliness that take away its age. II Here where the woods are wet, The blossoms of the dog's-tooth violet Seem meteors in a miniature firmament Of wild-flowers, where, with rainy sound and scent Of breeze and blossom, dim the April went: Their tongue-like leaves of umber-mottled green, So thickly seen, Seem dropping words of gold, Inaudible syllables of a magic old. Beside them, near the wahoo-bush and haw, Blooms the hepatica; Its slender flowers upon swaying stems Lifting chaste, solitary blooms, Astral, and twilight-colored,âfrail as gems That star the diadems Of elves and sylvans, piercing pale the glooms;â Or like the wands, the torches of the fays, That link lone, leafy ways With slim, uncertain rays:â (The faÃ«ry people, whom no eye may see, Busy, so legend says, With budding bough and leafing tree, The blossom's heart o' honey and honey-sack o' the bee, And all dim thoughts and dreams, That take the form of flowers, as it seems, And haunt the banks of greenwood streams, Showing in every line and curve, Commensurate with our love, an intimacy, A smiling confidence or sweet reserve.) There, at that leafy turn, Of trailered rocks, rise fronds of hart's-tongue fern: Fronds that my fancy names Uncurling gleeds of emerald and gold, Whose feathering flames Were kindled in the musky mould, And now, as stealthy as the graying morn, Thorn upon woolly thorn, Build up, and silently unfold Faint, cool, green fires, that burn Uneagerly, and spread around An elfin light above the ground, Like that green, rayless glow A spirit, lamped with crystal, makes below In dripping caves of labyrinthine moss, Or grottoes of the weedy undertow.â And in the underwoods, around them, toss The white-hearts with their penciled leaves, That, 'mid the shifting gleams and glooms, The interchanging shine and shade, Seem some soft garment made By visionary hands, that none perceives; Hands busy with invisible looms Of woodland shine and shade; a shadowy light, Whose figments interbraid, Carpeting the woods with colors and perfumes.â Or, are they fragments left in flight, These flow'rs that scatter every glade With windy, rippling white, And breezy, fluttering blue, Of her wild gown that shone upon my sight, A moment, in the woods I wandered through? April's, who fled this way? April, whom still I follow, Whom still my dreams pursue; Who leads me on by many a tangled clue Of loveliness, until in some green hollow, Born of her fragrance and her melody, But lovelier than herself and happier, too, Cradled in blossoms of the dogwood-tree, My soul shall see, White as a sunbeam in the heart of day, The infant, May. III Up, up, my heart! and forth where none perceives! 'Twas this which that sweet lay meant You heard in dreams. Come, let us take rich payment, For every care that grieves, From Nature's prodigal purse. 'Twas this that May meant By sending forth the wind which round our eaves Whispered all night;âor was 't the spirit who weaves, From gold and glaucous green of early leaves, Spring's regal raiment?â Up, up, my heart, and forth where none perceives! Come, let us forth, my heart, where none divines! Into far woodland places, Where we may meet the fair assembled races, Beneath the guardian pines, Of May's first flowers. . . . Poppy-celandines, And starry trilliums, bugled columbines, With which her hair, her radiant hair she twines, And loops and laces.â Come, let us forth, my heart, where none divines! Forth, forth, my heart, and let us find our dreams, There, where they haunt each hollow! Dreams luring us with oread feet to follow, With flying feet of beams, Fleeter and lighter than the fleetest swallow: Dreams, holding us with dryad glooms and gleams, With Naiad eyes, far stiller than still streams, That have beheld and still reflect, it seems, The god Apollo.â Forth, forth, my heart, and let us find our dreams! Out, out, my heart, the world is white with spring. Long have our dreams been pleaders: Now let them be our firm but gentle leaders. Come, let us forth and sing Among the amber-emerald-tufted cedars, And balm-o'-Gileads, cotton-woods, a-swing Like giant censers, that, from leaf-cusps fling Balsams of gummy gold, bewildering The winds their feeders. Out, out, my heart, the world is white with spring. Up, up, my heart, and all thy hope put on. Array thyself in splendor. Like some bright dragon-fly, some May-fly slender, The irised lamels don Of thy new armor; and, where burns the centre, Refulgent, of the opening rose of dawn, Spread thy wild wings, and, ere the hour be gone, Bright as a blast from some bold clarion, Thy Dream-world enter.â Up, up, my heart, and all thy hope put on. IV And then I heard it singing, The wind that touched my hair, A song of wild expression, A song that called in session The wild-flowers sweetly swinging, The wild-flowers lightly flinging Their tresses to the air. And first, beneath a bramble arch, The bloodroot rose; each bloom a torch Of hollow snow, within which, bright, The calyx grottoed golden light. Hepatica and bluet, And gold corydalis, Arose as to an aria; Then wild-phlox and dentaria, In rapture, ere they knew it, Trooped forward, nodding to it, Faint as a first star is. And then a music,âto the ear Inaudible,âI seemed to hear; A symphony that seemed to rise And speak in colors to the eyes. I saw the Jacob's-ladder Ring violet peal on peal Of perfume, azure-swinging; The bluebell slimly ringing Its purple chimes; and, gladder, Green note on note, the madder Bells of the Solomon's-seal. Now very near, now faintly lost, I saw their fragrant music tossed; Mixed dimly with white interludes Of trilliums starring cool the woods. Then choral, solitary, I saw the celandine Smite bright its golden cymbals, The starwort shake its timbrels, The whiteheart's horns of Fairy, With many a flourish airy, Strike silvery into line. And, lo, my soul they seemed to draw, By chords of loveliness and awe Into a Fairy world afar Where all man's dreams and longings are. V And then a spirit looked down at me Out of the deeps of the opal morn: Its eyes were blue as a sunlit sea, And young with the joy of a star that has just been born: And I seemed to hear, with my soul, the rose of its cool mouth say:â âLong I lay, long I lay, High on the Hills of the Break-of-Day, Where ever the light is green and gray, And the gleam of the moon is a silvery spray, And the stars are glimmering bubbles. Now from the Hills of the Break-of-Day I come, I come, on a rainbow ray, To laugh and sparkle, to leap and play, And blow from the face of the world away, Like mists, its griefs and troubles.â VI And now that the dawn is everywhere, Let us take this path through this wild, green place, Where the rattlesnake-weed shows its yellow face, And the lichens cover the rocks with lace: Where tannin-tinct is the woodland air, Let us take this path through the oaks where, thin, The low leaves whisper, âThe day is fairâ; And waters murmur, âCome in, come in, Where you can hark to our waterfalls, And the wind of their foam can play with your hair, And soothe away care.â Come here, come here, where our water calls.â Berry blossoms, that seem to flow As the winds blow, Blackberry blossoms swing and sway To and fro Along the way, Like ocean spray on a breezy day, Over the green of the grass as foam on the green of a bay, When the world is white and green with the white and the green of May. VII The dewberries are blooming now; The days are long, the nights are short; Each haw-tree and each dogwood bough Is bleached with bloom, and seems a part,â Reflected palely on her brow,â Of dreams that haunt the Year's young heart. But this will pass; and presently The world forget the spring that was; And underneath the wild-plum tree, 'Mid hornet hum and wild-bee's buzz, Summer, in dreamy reverie, Will sit all warm and amorous. Summer, with drowsy eyes and hair, Who walks the orchard aisles between; Whose hot touch tans the freckled pear, And crimsons peach and nectarine; And, in the vineyard everywhere, Bubbles with blue the grape's ripe green. Where now the briers blossoming are, Soon will the berries darkly glow; Then Summer pass: and star on star, Where now the grass is strewn below With petals, soon, both near and far, Will lie the obliterating snow. VIII But now the bluets blooming, The bluets brightly blue, O'er which the bees go booming, Drunk with the honey-dew, From wood-ways which they strew, Make eyes of love at you. . . . O slender Quaker-ladies, With eyes of heavenly hue, Who, where the mossy shade is, Hold quiet Quaker-meeting, Now tell me, is it true That these wild-bees are raiders? Bold gold-galloonÃ©d raiders? Gold-belted ambuscaders?â Or are they serenaders, Your gold-hipped serenaders, That, to your ears repeating Old ballads, come to woo, And win the hearts of you, The golden hearts of you? And here the bells of th' huckleberries toss, so it seems, in time, Delicate, tenderly white, thick by the wildwood way; Clusters swinging, it seems, inaudible peals of rhyme, Music visibly dropped from the virginal lips of the May, Crystally dropped, so it seems, bar upon blossoming bar, Pendent, pensively pale, star upon hollowed star. IX The star-flower now, that disks with gold The woodland moss, the forest grass, Already in a day is old, Already doth its beauty pass; Soon, undistinguished, with the mould 'Twill mingle and 'twill mix, alas. The bluet, too, that spreads its skies, Its little heavens, at our feet; And crowfoot-bloom, that, with soft eyes Of amber, now our eyes doth greet, Shall fade and pass, and none surmise How once they made the Maytime sweet. X But the crowfoot-bloom still trails its gold Along the edges of the oak-wood old; And there, where spreads the pond, still white are seen The lilies islanded between The pads' round archipelagoes of green; The jade-dark pads that pave The water's wrinkled wave; In which the vireo and the sparrow lave Their fluttered breasts and wings, Preening their backs, with many twitterings, With necks the moisture streaks; Then dipping deep their beaks, To which the beaded coolness clings, They bend their mellow throats And let the freshness trickle into notes. And now you hear The red-capped woodpecker rap near; And now that acrobat, The yellow-breasted chat, Calls high and clear, Chuckling his grotesque music from Some bough that he hath clomb. And now, and now, Upon another bough, Hark how the honey-throated thrush Scatters the forest's listening hush With notes of limpid harmony, Taking the woods with witcheryâ Or is 't a spirit, none can see. Hid in the top of some old tree, Who, in his house of leaves, of haunted green, Keeps trying, silver-sweet, his sunbeam flute serene? XI And then as I listened I seemed to see, Out of the sunset's ruin of gold, A presence, a spirit, look down at me, With eyes that were grave with the grief of a world grown old; And I seemed to hear, with my soul, the flame of its sad mouth sigh: âNow good-by, now good-by. Down to the Caves of the Night go I; Where a shadowy couch of the purple sky, That the moon and the starlight curtain high, Is spread for my joy and sorrow: Down to the Caves of the Night go I, Where side by side with mystery And all the Yesterdays I'll lie; And where from my body, before I die, Will be born the young To-morrow.â XII And here where the dusk steals on, you see, Violet-mantled, from tree to tree, The milkwort's spike of lavender hue,â Of rosy blue,â Tipped by the weight of a passing bee,â Nods like a goblin night-cap, slim, sedate, That night shall tassel with the dew, Beneath a canopy of rose and rue. And as the purple state Of twilight crowds the sunset's crimson gate, Now one, now two, Drifting the oaks' dark vistas through, The screech-owl's cry of âWho, oh, who, Who stays so late?â Drops like a challenge down to you. The silence deepens; it seems so still, That, if you laid to the tree your ear, You too might hear Its great roots growing into the hill; Or there on the twig of the oak-tree tall, The gray-green egg in the gray-green gall Split, and the little round worm and white, That grows to a gnat in a summer night, Uncurl in its nest as it dreams of flight. In the heart of the weed that grows near by,â If you laid your ear To a leaflet near,â You too might hear, if you, too, would try, The little gray worm, that becomes a fly A gray wood-fly, a rainbowed fly, As it feels a yearning for wings within, Minute of movement, steadily,â As a leaf-bud pushes from forth a tree,â Under the milk of its larval skin, The outward pressure of wings begin. Far off a vesper-sparrow lifts its song, Lost in the woods that now are beryl-wan; The path is drowned in dusk, is almost gone, Where now a fox or rabbit steals along: Dark is each vine-roofed hollow where, withdrawn, The creek-frog sounds his guttural gong, Like some squat dwarf or gnome, Seated upon his temple's oozy dome, Summoning the faithful unto prayer, Muezzin-like, the worshipers of the moon, The insect people of the earth and air, Who join him in his twilight tune. Along the path, where the lizard hides, An instant shadow, the spider glides; The hairy spider, that haunts the way, Crouching black by its earth-bored hole, An insect ogre, that lairs with the mole, Hungry, seeking its insect prey, Fast to follow and swift to slay.â And over your hands and over your face The cobweb brushes its phantom lace: And now, from many a stealthy place, Woolly-winged and gossamer-gray, The forest moths come fluttering, Marked and mottled with lichen hues, Seal-soft umbers and downy blues, Dark as the bark to which they cling. XIII Now in the hollow of a hill,â Like a glow-worm held in a giant hand,â Under the sunset's last red band, And one star hued like a daffodil, The windowed lamp of a cabin glows; The charcoal-burner's, whose hut is poor But always open; beside whose door An oak grows gnarled and a pine stands slim. Clean of soul, though of feature grim, Here he houses where no one knows, His only neighbors the cawing crows, That make a roost of the pine's top limb: His only friend the fiddle he bows As he sits at his door in the eve's repose Making it chuckle and sing and speak, Lovingly pressed to his swarthy cheek. And over many a root, through flowers and weeds, Past lonely places where the racoon breeds, By many a rock and water lying dim, Roofed with the brier and the bramble-rose, Under a star and the new-moon's rim, Downward the wood-way leads to him, Down where his lone lamp gleams and glows, A pencil slim Of marigold light under leaf and limb. XIV Ere that small sisterhood of misty stars, The PleiadÃ«s, consents to grace the sky; While still through sunset's golds and cinnabars The evening-star, like an Aladdin eye Of bright enchantment, at the day's last hour, Looks downward from its twilight-builded tower, Listen, and you may hear, now low, now high, A voice, a summons, fainter than a flower. There is a fellowship so still and sweet, A brotherhood, that speaks, unwordable, In every tree, in every stream you meet, The soul is fain to dream beneath its spell.â And heart-admitted to their presence there, Those intimacies of the earth and air, It shall hear things too wonderful to tell, Too deep to interpret, and more sweet than prayer. And you may see the things that are unseen, And hear the things that never have been heard: The whisper of the woods, in gray and green, Will walk by you, its heart a wildwood bird; Or by your side, in hushed and solemn wise, The silence sit; and clothed in glimmering dyes Of pearl and purple, with a sunset word, The dusk steal to you with tenebrious eyes. Then through the ugliness that toils in night. Uncouth, obscure, that hates the glare of day, Dull things that pierce the earth, avoid the light, And hide themselves in clamminess and clay,â The dumb, ungainly things, that make a home Of mud and mire they hill and honeycomb,â Through these, perhaps, in some mysterious way Beauty may speak, fairer than wind-wild foam. Not as it speaksâan eagle messageâdrawn In starry vastness from night's labyrinths: Not uttering itself from forth the dawn In egret hues: nor from the cloud-built plinths Of sunset's splendor, speaking burningly Unto the spirit; nor from flow'rs the bee Makes mouths of musk of, cymes of hyacinths,â But from the things that type humility. From things despised.âEv'n from the crawfish there, Hollowing its house of oozeâa wet, vague sound Of sleepy slime; or from the mole, whose lair, Blind-tunneled, corridors the earth aroundâ Beauty may draw her truths, as draws its wings The butterfly from the dull worm that clings, Cocoon and chrysalis; and from the ground Address the soul through even senseless things. The soul, that oft hath heard the trees' huge roots Fumble the darkness, clutching at the soil; The bird-like beaks of the imprisoned shoots Peck through the bark and into leaves uncoil; Hath heard the buried seed split through its pod, Groping its blind way up to light and God; The fungus, laboring with gnome-like toil, Heave slow its white orb through the encircling sod. The winds and waters, stars and streams and flowers, The very stones have tongues: and moss and fern And even lichens speak. This world of ours Is eloquent with things that bid us learn To pierce appearances, and so to mark, Within the rock and underneath the bark, Heard through some inward sense, the dreams that turn Outward to light and beauty from the dark. XV Then it came to pass as I gazed on space That I met with Mystery, face to face. Within her eyes my wondering soul beheld The eons past, the eons yet to come At cosmic labor; and the stars,âthat swelled, Flaming or nebulous, from the darkness dumb, In their appointed places, world and sun, I saw were truths made visible, whose sum Proclaimed one truth, the Word of Him, the One. And it came to pass as I went my ways That I met with Beauty, face to face. Within her eyes my worshiping spirit saw The moments busy with the dreams whence spring Earth's lovelinesses: and all things that awe Man's soul with their perfectionâeverything That buds and bourgeons, blossoming aboveâ I saw were letters of enduring law, Whose chapters make the beautiful book of Love. THE MAN HUNT The woods stretch deep to the mountain side, And the brush is wild where a man may hide. They have brought the bloodhounds up again To the roadside rock where they found the slain. They have brought the bloodhounds up, and they Have taken the trail to the mountain way. Three times they circled the trail and crossed, And thrice they found it and thrice they lost. Now straight through the trees and the under-brush They follow the scent through the forest's hush. And their deep-mouthed bay is a pulse of fear In the heart of the wood that the man must hear. The man who crouches among the trees From the stern-faced men who follow these. A huddle of rocks that the ooze has mossed And the trail of the hunted again is lost. An upturned pebble, a bit of ground A heel has trampledâthe trail is found. And the woods reÃ«cho the bloodhounds' bay As again they take to the mountain way. A rock, a ribbon of road, a ledge, With a pine tree clutching its crumbling edge. A pine, that the lightning long since clave, Whose huge roots hollow a ragged cave. A shout, a curse, and a face aghast, And the human quarry is laired at last. The human quarry with clay-clogged hair And eyes of terror who waits them there. That glares and crouches and rising then Hurls clods and curses at dogs and men. Until the blow of a gun-butt lays Him stunned and bleeding upon his face. A rope; a prayer; and an oak-tree near, And a score of hands to swing him clear. A grim, black thing for the setting sun And the moon and the stars to look upon. THE FOREST OF SHADOWS Deep in the hush of a mighty wood I came to a place of dread and dream, And forms of shadows, whose shapes elude The searching swords of the sun's dim gleam, Builders of silence and solitude. And there, where a glimmering water crept From rock to rock with a slumberous sound, Tired to tears, on the mossy ground, Under a tree I lay and slept. Was it the heart of an olden oak? Was it the soul of a flower that died? Or was it the wild-rose there that spoke, The wilding lily that palely sighed?â For all on a sudden it seemed I awoke: And the leaves and the flowers were all intent On a visible something of light and bloomâ A presence, felt as a wild perfume, Or beautiful music, that came and went. And all the grief I had known was gone, And all the anguish of heart and soul; And the burden of care that had made me wan Lifted and left me young and whole As once in the flush of my youth's dead dawn. And lo! it was night. And the oval moon, A silvery spectre, paced the wood: And there in its light, like snow, she stood, As starry still as a star a-swoon. At first I thought that I looked into A shadowy water of violet, Where the faint reflection of one I knew, Long dead, gazed up from its mirror wet, Till she smiled in my face as the living do: Till I felt her touch, and heard her say, In a voice as still as a rose unfolds,â âYou have come at last: now nothing holds: Give me your hand: let us wander away. âLet us wander away through the Shadow Wood, Through the Shadow Wood to the Shadow Land, Where the trees have speech and the blossoms brood, Like visible music; and, hand in hand, The winds and the waves go, rainbow-hued: Where ever the voice of beauty sighs, And ever the dance of dreams goes on; Where nothing grows old: and the dead and gone, And the loved and the lost, smile into your eyes. âLet us wander away! let us wander away!â Do you hear them calling, âCome here and liveâ? Do you hear what the trees and the flowers say, Wonderful, wild, and imperative, Hushed as the hues of the dawn of day?â They say, âYour life, that was rose and rue, In a world of shadows where all things die, Where beauty is dust, and love, a lie, Is ended. Come! we are waiting for you.ââ And she took my hand: and the trees around Seemed whispering something I dared not hear; And the taciturn flowers, that strewed the ground, Seemed thinking something I felt with fearâ A beautiful something that made no sound.â And she led me on through the forest old, Where the moon and the midnight stood on guard,â Sentinel spirits that shimmered the sward, Silver and sable and glimmering gold. And then in a moment I knew. . . . I knew What the trees had whispered, the winds had said; What the flowers had thought in their hearts of dew, And the stars had syllabled overheadâ And she bent above me and smiled, â'Tis true! Heart of my heart, you have heard aright.â Look in my eyes and draw me near! Look in my face and have no fear!â Heart of my heart, you died to-night!â âROSE LEAVES, WHEN THE ROSE IS DEADâ See how the rose leaves fall, The rose leaves fall and fade; And by the wall, in shade funereal, How leaf on leaf is laid, Withered and soiled and frayed! How red the rose leaves fallâ And in the ancient trees, That stretch their ghostly arms about the Hall, Burdened with mysteries, How sadly sighs the breeze! How soft the rose leaves fallâ The rose leaves fall and lie! While over them dull slugs and beetles crawl, And, palely glimmering by, The glow-worm trails its eye. How thick the rose leaves fall, And strew the garden way! For snails to slime and spotted toads to sprawl, And, plodding past each day, Coarse feet to tread in clay. How fast they fade and fall Where Beauty, carved in stone, With broken hands veils her dead eyes, and, tall, White in the moonlight lone, Stands like a marble moan. How slow they drift and fall And strew the fountained pool, That, in the nymph-carved basin by the wall, Reflects, in darkness cool, Ruin made beautiful. How red the rose leaves fall, Fall, and like blood remain Upon the dial's disk, whose pedestal, Black-mossed, and dark with stain, Crumbles in sun and rain. How dim they seem to fall Around one where she stands, Deep in their midst, beyond the years' recall, Reaching pale, passionate hands Into the past's vague lands. How still the rose leaves fall Around them as they meet As oft of old! she, in her gem-pinned shawl Of white; and he, complete In black from head to feet. How faint the rose leaves fall Around them where, it seems, He holds her clasped, parting from her and all His heart's wild hopes and dreams, There in the moon's pale beams! Around them rose leaves fallâ And in the stress and urge Of winds that strew them wanly over all, With deep, autumnal surge, There floats a funeral dirge:â âSee how the rose leaves fall Upon thy dead, O soul! The rose leaves of the love that once in thrall Held thee, beyond control, Making thy heart's world whole. âGod help them still to fall Around thee, bowed above The face within thy heart, beneath the pall, The perished face thereof, The beautiful face of Love.â MUSIC AND MOONLIGHT White roses, like a mist Upon a terraced height; And 'mid the roses, opal, moonbeam kissed, A fountain falling white. And as the full moon flows, Orb'd fire, into a cloud, There is a fragrant sound as if a rose Sighed its sweet soul aloud. There is a whisper pale, As if a rose awoke, And, having heard in sleep the nightingale, Still dreaming of it spoke. Now, as from some vast shell A giant pearl rolls white, From the dividing cloud, that winds compel, The moon sweeps, big and bright. Moon-mists and pale perfumes, Wind-wafted through the dusk: There is a sound as if unfolding blooms Voiced their sweet thoughts in musk. A spirit is abroad Of music and of sleep; The moon and mists have made for it a road Adown the violet deep. It breathes a tale to me, A tale of ancient day; And, like a dream, again I seem to see Those towers old and gray. That castle by the foam, Where once our hearts made moan: And through the night again you seem to come Down statued stairs of stone. Again I feel your hair, Dark, fragrant, deep and cool: You lift your face up, pale with its despair, And wildly beautiful. Again your form I strain, Again, unto my heart; Again your lips, again and yet again, I press . . . and then we part. As centuries ago We did in Camelot; Where once we lived that life of bliss and woe, That you remember not. When you were Guinevere, And I was Launcelot. . . . I have remembered many and many a year, And youâyou have forgot. THE AWAKENING God made that night of pearl and ivory, Perfect and holy as a holy thought Born of perfection, dreams, and ecstasy, In love and silence wrought. And she, who lay where, through the casement falling, The moonlight clasped with arms of vapory gold Her DanaÃ« beauty, seemed to hear a calling Deep in the garden old. And then it seemed, through some strange sense, she heard The roses softly speaking in the night,â Or was it but the nocturne of a bird Haunting the white moonlight? It seemed a fragrant whisper vaguely roaming From rose to rose, a language sweet that blushed, Saying, âWho comes? Who is this swiftly coming, With face so dim and hushed? âAnd now, and now we hear a wild heart beatingâ Whose heart is this that beats among our blooms? Whose every pulse in rapture keeps repeating Wild words like wild perfumes?â . . . And then it ceased: and then she heard a sigh, As if a lily syllabled sweet scent,â Or was it but the wind that silverly Touched some stringed instrument? And then again a rumor she detected Among the roses, words of musk and myrrh, Saying, âHe comes! the one she hath expected, Who long hath sought for her. The one whose coming made her soul awaken, Whose face is fragrance and whose feet are fire: The one by whom her being shall be shaken With dreams and deep desire.â And then she rose, and to the casement hastened, And flung it wide and, leaning outward, gazed: Above, the night hung, moon and starlight chastened; Below, with shadows mazed, The garden bloomed. Around her and o'erhead All seemed at pauseâsave one wild star that streamed, One rose that fell.âAnd then she sighed and said, âI must have dreamed, have dreamed.â And then again she seemed to hear it speak, A moth that murmured of a star attained,â Or was it but the fountain whispering weak, White where the moonbeams rained? And still it grew; and still the sound insisted, Louder and sweeter, burning into form, Until at last a presence, starlight-misted, It shone there rosy warm: Crying, âCome down! long have I watched and waited! Come down! draw near! or, like some splendid flower, Let down thy hair! so I may climb as fated Into thy heart's high tower. Lower! bend lower, so thy heart may hear me! Thy soul may clasp me! . . . Beautiful above All beautiful things, behold me. yea, draw near me; Behold! for I am Love.â THE VALE OF TEMPE All night I lay upon the rocks: And now the dawn comes up this way, One great star trembling in her locks Of rosy ray. I can not tell the things I 've seen, The things I 've heard I dare not speak: The dawn is breaking, gold and green, O'er vale and peak. My soul hath kept its tryst again With her as once in ages past, In that lost life, I know not when, Which was my last: When she was dryad, I was faun, And lone we loved in Tempe's Vale, Where once we saw Endymion Pass passion-pale: Where once we saw him clasp and meet Among the pines, with kiss on kiss, Moon-breasted and most heavenly sweet, White Artemis. Where often, Bacchus-borne, we heard The MÃ¦nad shout, wild-revelling: And filled with witchcraft, past all word, The Limnad sing. Bloom-bodied 'mid the twilight trees We saw the Oread, who shone Fair as the forms Praxiteles Carved out of stone. And oft, goat-footed, in a glade We marked the Satyrs dance, and great, Man-muscled, like the oaks that shade Dodona's gate, Fierce Centaurs hoof a torrent's bank With wind-tossed manes, or leap a crag, While swift, the arrow in its flank, Swept by the stag. And minnow-white the Naiad there We watched, foam-shouldered, in her stream, Wringing the moisture from her hair Of emerald gleam. We saw the oak unclose and, brown, Sap-scented, from its door of bark The Hamadryad young step down: Or, crouching dark Within the oak's old heart, we felt Her eyes, that pierced the fibrous gloom; Her breath, that was the musk we smelt, The wild perfume. There is no flower that opens glad Wide eyes of dawn and sunset hue, As fair as the Leimoniad We saw there too: That flower-divinity, rose-born, Of sunlight and white dew, whose blood Is fragrance, and whose heart of morn A crimson bud. There is no star that rises white, To tiptoe down the deeps of dusk, Sweet as the moony Nymphs of Night With breasts of musk, We met among the mystery And hush of forests, where, afar, We watched their hearts beat glimmeringly, Each heart a star. There is no beam that rays the marge Of mist that trails from cape to cape, From panther-haunted gorge to gorge, Bright as the shape Of her, the one Auloniad, That, born of wind and grassy gleams, Silvered upon our sight, dim-clad In foam of streams. All, all of these I saw again, Or dreamed I saw, as there, ah me! Upon the cliffs, above the plain, In Thessaly, I lay, while Mount Olympus helmed Its brow with moon-effulgence deep, And, far below, vague, overwhelmed With reedy sleep, Peneus flowed, and, murmuring, sighed, Meseemed, for its dead gods, whose ghosts Through its dark forests seemed to glide In whispering hosts. . . . 'Mid whose pale shapes again I spoke With her, my soul, as I divine, Dim 'neath some gnarled Olympian oak, Or Ossan pine, Till down the slopes of heaven came Those daughters of the Dawn, the Hours, Clothed on with raiment blue of flame, And crowned with flowers; When she, with whom my soul once more Had trystedâlimbed of light and airâ Whom to my breast,â(as oft of yore In Tempe there, When she was dryad, I was faun)â I clasped and held, and pressed and kissed, Within my arms, as broke the dawn, Became a mist. THE BALLAD OF LOW-LIE-DOWN John-a-dreams and Harum-Scarum Came a-riding into town: At the Sign o' the Jug-and-Jorum There they met with Low-lie-down. Brave in shoes of Romany leather, Bodice blue and gipsy gown, And a cap of fur and feather, In the inn sat Low-lie-down. Harum-Scarum kissed her lightly, Smiled into her eyes of brown, Clasped her waist and held her tightly, Laughing, âLovely Low-lie-down!â Then with many an oath and swagger, As a man of great renown, On the board he clapped his dagger, Called for sack and sat him down. So a while they laughed together; Then he rose and with a frown Sighed, âWhile still 'tis pleasant weather, I must leave thee, Low-lie-down.â So away rode Harum-Scarum, With a song rode out of town; At the Sign o' the Jug-and-Jorum Weeping lingered Low-lie-down. Then this John-a-dreams, in tatters, In his pocket ne'er a crown, Touched her saying, âWench, what matters! Dry your eyes and, come, sit down. âHere 's my hand: we'll roam together, Far away from thorp and town. Here 's my heart,âfor any weather,â And my dreams, too, Low-lie-down. âSome men call me dreamer, poet: Some men call me fool and clownâ What I am but you shall know it, Only you, sweet Low-lie-down.â For a little while she pondered: Smiled: then said, âLet care go drown!â Rose and kissed him. . . . Forth they wandered, John-a-dreams and Low-lie-down. VAGABONDS I It's ho, it's ho! when haw-trees blow Among the hills that Springtime thrills; When huckleberries, row on row, Hang out their blossom-bells of snow Around the rills that music fills: When haw-trees blow among the hills, It 's ho, it 's ho! oh let us go, My love and I, where fancy wills. II It 's hey, it 's hey! when daisies sway Among the meads where Summer speeds; When ripeness bends each fruited spray, And harvest wafts adown the day The feathered seeds of golden weeds: When daisies sway among the meads, It 's hey, it 's hey! oh, let 's away, My heart and I, where longing leads. III It 's ay, it 's ay! when red leaves fly, And strew the ways where Autumn strays; When round the beech and chestnut lie The sturdy burrs where creeks run dry, And frosts and haze turn golds to grays: When red leaves fly and strew the ways, It 's ay, it 's ay! oh, let us hie, My love and I, where dreaming says. IV Wassail! wassail! when snow and hail Make white the lands where Winter stands; When wild winds from the forests flail The last dead leaves, and, in the gale, The trees wring hands in ghostly bands: When snow and hail make white the lands, Wassail! wassail! oh, let us trail, My heart and I, where love commands. REVEALMENT A sense of sadness in the golden air, A pensiveness, that has no part in care, As if the Season, by some woodland pool, Braiding the early blossoms in her hair, Seeing her loveliness reflected there, Had sighed to find herself so beautiful. A breathlessness, a feeling as of fear, Holy and dim, as of a mystery near, As if the World, about us, listening went, With lifted finger and hand-hollowed ear, Harkening a music, that we can not hear, Haunting the quickening earth and firmament. A prescience of the soul that has no name, Expectancy that is both wild and tame, As if the Earth, from out its azure ring Of heavens, looked to see, as white as flame,â As Perseus once to chained Andromeda came,â The swift, divine revealment of the Spring. A YELLOW ROSE The old gate clicks, and down the walk, Between clove-pink and hollyhock, Still young of face though gray of lock, Among her garden's flowers she goes, At evening's close, Deep in her hair a yellow rose. The old house shows one gable-peak Above its trees; and sage and leek Blend with the flowers' their scent: the creek, Leaf-hidden, past the garden flows, That on it snows Pale petals of the yellow rose. The crickets pipe in dewy damps; And everywhere the fireflies' lamps Flame like the lights of fairy camps; While, overhead, the soft sky shows One star that glows, As, in gray locks, a yellow rose. There is one spot she seeks for where The roses make a fragrant lair, A spot where once he kissed her hair, And told his love, as each one knows, Each flower that blows, And pledged it with a yellow rose. The years have turned her dark hair gray Since that far time: and still, they say, She keeps the tryst as on that day; And through the garden softly goes, At evening's close, Wearing for him that yellow rose. WHIPPOORWILL TIME I Let down the bars; drive in the cows: The west is barred with burning rose. Unhitch the horses from the ploughs, And from the cart the ox that lows, And light the lamp within the house:â The whippoorwill is calling, âWhip-poor-will, whip-poor-will,â Where the locust blooms are falling On the hill; The sunset's rose is dying, And the whippoorwill is crying, âWhip-poor-will, whip-poor-will;â Soft, now shrill, The whippoorwill is crying, âWhip-poor-will.â II Unloose the watch-dog from his chain: The first stars wink their drowsy eyes: A sheep-bell tinkles in the lane, And where the shadow deepest lies A lamp makes bright the kitchen pane:â The whippoorwill is calling, âWhip-poor-will, whip-poor-will,â Where the berry-blooms are falling On the rill; The first faint stars are springing, And the whippoorwill is singing, âWhip-poor-will, whip-poor-will;â Softly still The whippoorwill is singing, âWhip-poor-will.â III The cows are milked: the cattle fed: The last far streaks of evening fade: The farm-hand whistles in the shed, And in the house the table 's laid, Its lamp streams on the garden-bed:â The whippoorwill is calling, âWhip-poor-will, whip-poor-will,â Where the dogwood blooms are falling On the hill: The afterglow is waning, And the whippoorwill 's complaining, âWhip-poor-will, whip-poor-will;â Wild and shrill, The whippoorwill 's complaining, âWhip-poor-will.â IV The moon blooms out, a great white rose; The stars wheel onward towards the west; The barnyard-cock wakes once and crows; The farm is wrapped in peaceful rest; The cricket chirrs; the firefly glows:â The whippoorwill is calling, âWhip-poor-will, whip-poor-will,â Where the bramble-blooms are falling On the rill; The moon her watch is keeping, And the whippoorwill is weeping, âWhip-poor-will, whip-poor-will:â Lonely still, The whippoorwill is weeping, âWhip-poor-will.â NOVEMBER I Morning Deep in her broom-sedge, burrs, and ironweeds, Her frost-slain asters and dead mallow-moons, Where gray the wilding clematis balloons The brake with puff-balls: where the slow stream leads Her slower steps; decked with the scarlet beads, Of hip and haw; through dolorous maroons And desolate golds, she goes; the wailing tunes Of all the winds about her like wild reeds. The red wrought-iron hues that flush the green Of blackberry briers, and the bronze that stains The oak's sere leaves, are in her cheeks: the gray Of forest pools, thin-clocked with ice, is keen In her cold eyes; and in her hair, the rain's Chill silver shimmers like a moonlight ray. II Noon Lost in the sleepy grays and drowsy browns Of woodlands, smoky with the autumn haze, Where dull the last, leafed maples, smouldering, blaze Like ghosts of sachem fires, the month uncrowns Her frosty hair; and where the forest drowns The road in darkness, in the rutted ways, Filled full of freezing rain, her robe she lays Of tattered gold, and seats herself and frowns. And at her frown each wood and bosky hill Shudders with prescience of approaching storm, Her soul's familiar fiend, who, with wild broom Of wind and rain, works her resistless will, Sweeping the world, and driving with fierce arm The clouds, like leaves, through the tumultuous gloom. III Evening The shivering wind sits in the oaks, whose limbs, Twisted and tortured, nevermore are still; Grief and decay sit with it; they, whose chill Autumnal touch makes hectic red the rims Of all the oak-leaves; desolating, dims The ageratum's blue that banks the rill; And splits the milkweed's pod upon the hill, And shakes it free of the last seed that swims. Down goes the day despondent to its close: And now the sunset's hands of copper build A tower of brass, behind whose burning bars, The Day, in fierce, barbarian repose, Like some imprisoned Inca sits, hate-filled, Crowned with the gold corymbus of the stars. IV Night There is a booming in the forest boughs; Tremendous feet seem trampling through the trees: The storm is at his wildman revelries, And earth and heaven echo his carouse. Night reels with tumult; and, from out her house Of cloud, the moon looks,âlike a face one sees In nightmare,âhurrying, with pale eyes that freeze, Stooping above with white, malignant brows. The isolated oak upon the hill, That seemed, at sunset, in terrific lands A Titan head black in a sea of blood, Now seems a monster harp, whose wild strings thrill To the vast fingering of innumerable handsâ Spirits of tempest and of solitude. HALLOWMAS All hushed of glee, The last chill bee Clings wearily To the dying aster: The leaves drop faster: And all around, red as disaster, The forest crimsons with tree on tree. A butterfly, The last to die, Droops heavily by, Weighed down with torpor: The air grows sharper: And the wind in the trees, like some sad harper, Sits and sorrows with sigh on sigh. The far crows call; The acorns fall; And over all The Autumn raises Dun mists and hazes, Through which her soul, it seemeth, gazes On ghosts and dreams in carnival. The end is near: The dying Year Leans low to hear Her own heart breaking, And Beauty taking Her flight, and all her dreams forsaking Her soul, bowed down 'mid the sad and sere. AUBADE Awake! the Dawn is on the hills! Behold, at her cool throat a rose, Blue-eyed and beautiful she goes, Leaving her steps in daffodils.â Awake! arise! and let me see Thine eyes, whose deeps epitomize All dawns that were or are to be, O love, all Heaven in thine eyes!â Awake! arise! come down to me! Behold! the Dawn is up: behold! How all the birds around her float, Wild rills of music, note on note, Spilling the air with mellow gold.â Arise! awake! and, drawing near, Let me but hear thee and rejoice! Thou, who bear'st captive, sweet and clear, All song, O love, within thy voice! Arise! awake! and let me hear! See, where she comes, with limbs of day, The Dawn! with wild-rose hands and feet, Within whose veins the sunbeams beat, And laughters meet of wind and ray. Arise! come down! and, heart to heart, Love, let me clasp in thee all theseâ The sunbeam, of which thou art part, And all the rapture of the breeze!â Arise! come down! loved that thou art! WOMAN'S LOVE Sweet lies! the sweetest ever heard, To her he said: Her heart remembers every word Now he is dead. I ask:ââIf thus his lies can make Your young heart grieve for his false sake, Had he been true what had you done, For true love's sake?ââ âUpon his grave there in the sun, Avoided now of allâbut one, I 'd lay my heart with all its ache, And let it break, and let it break.â And falsehood! fairer ne'er was seen Than he put on: Her heart recalls each look and mien Now he is gone. I ask:ââIf thus his treachery Can hold your heart with lie on lie, What had you done for manly love, Love without lie?ââ âThere in the grass that grows above His grave, where all could know thereof, I 'd lay me down without a sigh, And gladly die, and gladly die.â AT MOONRISE Pale faces looked up at me, up from the earth, like flowers. Pale hands reached down to me, out of the dusk, like stars, As over the hills, robed on with twilight, the Hours, The Day's last Hours departed, and the Night put up her bars. Pale fingers beckoned me on, pale fingers, like starlit mist; Dim voices called to me, dim as the wind's dim rune, As up from the trees, like a Nymph from the amethyst Of her waters, as silver as foam, rose the round, white breast of the moon. And I followed the pearly waving and beckon of hands, The luring glitter and dancing glimmer of feet, And the sibilant whisper of silence, that summoned to lands Remoter than legend or faery, where Myth and Tradition meet. And I came to a place where the shadow of ancient Night Brooded o'er ruins, far wilder than castles of dreams, Fantastic, a mansion of phantoms, where, wandering white, I met with a shadowy presence whose voice I had followed it seems. And the ivy waved in the wind and the moonlight laid, Like a ghostly benediction, a finger wan On the face of the one from whose eyes the darkness rayed, The presence I knew for one I had known in the years long gone. And she looked in my face and kissed me on brow and on cheek, Murmured my name and wistfully smiled in my eyes; And the tears welled up in my heart that was wild and weak, And my bosom seemed bursting with yearning and my soul with sighs. And there 'mid the ruins we sat.âOh, strange were the words that she said! Distant and dim and strange:âand hollow the looks that she gave:â And I knew her then for a joy, a joy that was dead, A hope, a beautiful hope, that my youth had laid in its grave. THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW Like some gaunt ghost the tempest wails Outside my door; its icy nails Beat on my pane. And night and storm Around the house, with furious flails Of wind, from which the slant sleet hails, Stalk up and down; or, arm in arm, Stand giant guard; the wild-beast lair Of their fierce bosoms black and bare. . . . My lamp is lit. I have no fear. Through night and storm my love draws near. Now through the forest how they go, With whirlwind hoofs, and maned with snow, The beasts of tempest! winter herds, That lift huge heads of mist and low Like oxen; beasts of air, that blow Ice from their nostrils; winged like birds, And bullock-breasted, onward hurled, That shake with tumult all the world. . . . My lamp is set where love can see, Who through the tempest comes to me. I press my face against the pane, And seem to see, from wood and plain, In phantom thousands, stormy pale, The ghosts of forests, tempest-slain, Vast wraiths of woodlands, rise and strain And rock wild limbs against the gale; Or, borne in fragments overhead, Sow night with horror and with dread. . . . He comes! My light is as an arm To guide him onward through the storm. I hear the tempest from the sky Cry, eagle-like, its battle-cry; I hear the night, upon the peaks, Send back its condor-like reply; And then again come booming by The forest's challenge, hoarse as speaks Hate unto hate, or wrath to wrath, When each draws sword and sweeps the path.â But let them rage! through darkness far My bright light leads him like a star. The cliffs, with all their plumes of pines, Bow down high heads: the battle-lines Of all the hills, that iron seams, Shudder through all their rocky spines: And under shields of matted vines The vales crouch down: and all the streams Are hushed and frozen as with fear As from the deeps the winds draw near. . . . But let them come! my lamp is lit! Nor shall their fury flutter it. Now round and round, with stride on stride, In Boreal armor, tempest-dyed, I hear the thunder of their strokesâ The heavens are rocked on every side With all their clouds; and far and wide The earth roars back with all its oaks. . . . Still at the pane burns bright my light To guide him onward through the night, To lead love through the night and storm Where my young heart will make him warm. ACHIEVEMENT He held himself splendidly forward Both early and late; The aim of his purpose was starward, To master his fate. So he wrought and he toiled and he waited, Till he rose o'er the hordes that he hated, And stood on the heights, as was fated, Made one of the great. Then, lo! on the top of the mountain, With walls that were wide, A city! from which, like a fountain, Rose voices that cried:â âHe comes! Let us forth now to meet him! Both mummer and priest let us greet him! In the city he built let us seat him On the throne of his pride!â Then out of the city he builded, Of shadows it seems, From gates that his fancy had gilded With thought's brightest beams, Strange mimes and chimeras came trooping, With moping and mowing and stoopingâ And he saw with a heart that was drooping, That these were his dreams. He entered; and, lo! as he entered, They murmured his name; And led him where, burningly centered, An altar of flame Made lurid a temple,âerected Of self,âwhere a form he detectedâ The love that his life had rejected . . . And this was his fame! MYSTERIES Soft and silken and silvery brown, In shoes of lichen and leafy gown, Little blue butterflies fluttering around her, Deep in the forest, afar from town, There, where a stream was trickling down, I met with Silence, who wove a crown Of sleep whose mystery bound her. I gazed in her eyes, that were mossy green As the rain that pools in the hollow between The twisted roots of a tree that towers; And I saw the things that none has seen,â That mean far more than facts may mean,â The dreams, that are true, of an age that has been, That God has thought into flowers. I gazed at her lips, that were dewy gray As the mist that clings, at the close of day, To the wet hillside when the winds cease blowing: And I heard the things that none may say,â That are holier far than the prayers we pray,â The murmured music God breathes alway Through the hearts of all things growing. Soft and subtle and vapory white, In shoes of shadow and gown of light, Crimson poppies asleep around her, Far in the forest, beneath a height, I came on Slumber, who wove from night A wreath of silence, that, darkly bright, With its mystic beauty crowned her. I looked in her face, that was pale and still As the moon that rises above the hill Where the pines loom sombre as sorrow: And the things that all have known and will, I knew for a momentâthe myths that fill And people the past of the soul and thrill Its hope with a far to-morrow. I heard her voice, that was strange with pain As a wind that whispers of wreck and rain To the leaves of the autumn rustling lonely: And I felt the things that are felt in vain By allâthe longings that haunt the brain Of man, that come and depart again And are part of his dreamings only. A SONG OF THE SNOW I Roaring winds that rocked the crow, High in his eyrie, All night long, and to and fro Swung the cedar and drove the snow Out of the North, have ceased to blow, And dawn breaks fiery. Sing, Ho, a song of the winter dawn, When the air is still and the clouds are gone, And the snow lies deep on hill and lawn, And the old clock ticks, â'Tis time! 'tis time!â And the household rises with many a yawnâ Sing, Ho, a song of the winter dawn! Sing, Ho! II Deep in the East a rosy glow Broadens and brightens, Glints through the icicles, row on row, Flames on the panes of the farm-house low, And over the miles of drifted snow Silently whitens. Sing, Ho, a song of the winter sky, When the last star closes its icy eye, And deep in the road the snow drifts lie, And the old clock ticks, â'Tis late! 'tis late!â And the flame on the hearth leaps red, leaps highâ Sing, Ho, a song of the winter sky! Sing, Ho! III Into the heav'n the sun comes slow, All red and frowsy: Out of the shed the muffled low Of the cattle comes; the rooster's crow Sounds strangely distant beneath the snow And dull and drowsy. Sing, Ho, a song of the winter morn, When the snow makes ghostly the wayside thorn, And hills of pearl are the shocks of corn, And the old clock ticks, âTick-tock, tick-tock;â And the goodman bustles about the barnâ Sing, Ho, a song of the winter morn! Sing, Ho! IV Now to their tasks the farm-hands go, Cheerily, cheerily: With ears a-tingle and cheeks a-glow, She with her pail and he with his hoe, To milk the cows and to path the snow, Merrily, merrily. Sing, Ho, a song of the winter day, When ermine-capped are the stacks of hay, And the wood-smoke pillars the air with gray, And the old clock ticks, âTo work! to work!â And the goodwife sings as she churns awayâ Sing, Ho, a song of the winter day! Sing, Ho! THE WOOD WATER An evil, stealthy water, dark as hate, Sunk from the light of day, 'Thwart which is hung a ruined water-gate, Creeps on its stagnant way. Moss and the spawny duckweed, dim as air, And green as copperas, Choke its dull current; and, like hideous hair, Tangles of twisted grass. Above it sinister trees,âas crouched and gaunt As huddled Terror,âlean; Guarding some secret in that nightmare haunt, Some horror they have seen. Something the sunset points at from afar, Spearing the sullen wood And hag-gray water with a single bar Of flame as red as blood. Something the stars, conspiring with the moon, Shall look on, and remain Frozen with fear; staring as in a swoon, Striving to flee in vain. Something the wisp that, wandering in the night, Above the ghastly stream, Haply shall find; and, filled with frantic fright, Light with its ghostly gleam. Something that lies there under weed and ooze, With wide and awful eyes And matted hair, and limbs the waters bruise, That strives yet can not rise. THE EGRET HUNTER Through woods the Spanish moss makes gray, With deeps the daylight never reaches, The water sluices slow its way, And chokes with weeds its beaches. 'T was here, lost in this lone bayou, Where poison brims each blossom's throat, Last night I followed a firefly glow, And oared a leaky boat. The way was dark; and overhead The wailing limpkin moaned and cried; The moss, like cerements of the dead, Waved wildly on each side. The way was black, albeit the trees Let here and there the moonlight through, The shadows, 'mid the cypress-knees, Seemed ominous of hue. And then, behold! a boat that oozed Slow slime and trailed rank water-weeds Loomed on me: in which, interfused, Great glow-worms glowed like beads. And in its rotting hulk, upright, His eyeless eyes fixed far before, A dead man sat, and stared at night, Grasping a rotting oar. Slowly it passed; and fearfully The moccasin slid in its wake; The owl shrunk shrieking in its tree; And in its hole the snake. But I, who met it face to face, I could not shrink nor turn aside: Within that dark and demon place There was nowhere to hide. Slowly it passed; for me too slow! The grim Death, in the moon's faint shine, Whose story, haply, none may know Save th' owl that haunts the pine. THE MIRACLE OF THE DAWN What would it mean for you and me If dawn should come no more! Think of its gold along the sea, Its rose above the shore! That rose of awful mystery, Our souls bow down before. What wonder that the Inca kneeled, The Aztec prayed and pled And sacrificed to it, and sealed,â With rites that long are dead,â The marvels that it once revealed To them it comforted. What wonder, yea! what awe, behold! What rapture and what tears Were ours, if wild its rivered gold,â That now each day appears,â Burst on the world, in darkness rolled, Once every thousand years! Think what it means to me and you To see it even as God Evolved it when the world was new! When Light rose, earthquake-shod, And slow its gradual splendor grew O'er deeps the whirlwind trod. What shoutings then and cymballings Arose from depth and height! What worship-solemn trumpetings, And thunders, burning-white, Of winds and waves, and anthemings Of Earth received the Light. Think what it means to see the dawn! The dawn, that comes each day!â What if the East should ne'er grow wan, Should nevermore grow gray! That line of rose no more be drawn Above the ocean's spray! PENETRALIA I am a part of all you see In Nature; part of all you feel: I am the impact of the bee Upon the blossom; in the tree I am the sap,âthat shall reveal The leaf, the bloom,âthat flows and flutes Up from the darkness through its roots. I am the vermeil of the rose, The perfume breathing in its veins; The gold within the mist that glows Along the west and overflows The heaven with light; the dew that rains Its freshness down and strings with spheres Of wet the webs and oaten ears. I am the egg that folds the bird, The song that beaks and breaks its shell; The laughter and the wandering word The water says; and, dimly heard, The music of the blossom's bell When soft winds swing it; and the sound Of grass slow-creeping o'er the ground. I am the warmth, the honey-scent That throats with spice each lily-bud That opens, white with wonderment, Beneath the moon; or, downward bent, Sleeps with a moth beneath its hood: I am the dream that haunts it too, That crystallizes into dew. I am the seed within its pod; The worm within its closed cocoon: The wings within the circling clod, The germ that gropes through soil and sod To beauty, radiant in the noon: I am all these, behold! and moreâ I am the love at the world-heart's core. THE HEAVEN-BORN Not into these dark cities, These sordid marts and streets, That the sun in his rising pities, And the moon with sorrow greets, Does she, with her dreams and flowers, For whom our hearts are dumb, Does she of the golden hours, Earth's heaven-born Beauty come. Afar 'mid the hills she tarries, Beyond the farthest streams, In a world where music marries With color that blooms and beams; Where shadow and light are wedded, Whose children people the Earth, The fair, the fragrant-headed, The pure, the wild of birth. Where Morn with rosy kisses Wakes ever the eyes of Day; And, winds in her radiant tresses, Haunts every wildwood way: Where Eve, with her mouth's twin roses, Her kisses sweet with balm, The eyes of the glad Day closes, And, crowned with stars, sits calm. There, lost in contemplation Of things no mortal sees, She dwells, the incarnation Of idealities; Of dreams, that long have fired Men's hearts with joy and pain,â The far, the dear-desired, Whom no man shall attain. THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE Booted and spurred he rode toward the west, A rose, from the woman who loved him best, Lay warm with her kisses there in his breast, And the battle beacons were burning. As over the draw he galloping went, She, from the gateway's battlement, With a wafted kiss and a warning bentâ âBeware of the ford at the turning!â An instant only he turned in his sell, And lightly fingered his petronel, Then settled his sword in its belt as well, And the horns to battle were sounding. She watched till he reached the beacon there, And saw its gleam on his helm and hair, Then turned and murmured, âGod keep thee, Clare! From that wolf of the hills and his hounding.â And on he rode till he came to the hill, Where the road turned off by the ruined mill, Where the stream flowed shallow and broad and still, And the battle beacon was burning. Into the river with little heed, Down from the hill he galloped his steedâ The water whispered on rock and reed, âDeath hides by the ford at the turning!â And out of the night on the other side, Their helms and corselets dim descried, He saw ten bandit troopers ride, And the horns to battle were blaring. Then he reined his steed in the middle ford, And glanced behind him and drew his sword, And laughed as he shouted his battle-word, âClare! Clare! and my steel needs airing!â Then down from the hills at his back there came Ten troopers more. With a face of flame Red Hugh of the Hills led on the same, In the glare of the beacon's burning. Again the cavalier turned and gazed, Then quick to his lips the rose he raised, And kissed it, crying, âNow God be praised! And help her there when mourning!â Then he rose in his stirrups and loosened rein, And shouting his cry spurred on amain Into the troopers to slay and be slain, While the horns to battle were blowing. With ten behind him and ten before, And the battle beacon to light the shore, Small doubt of the end in his mind he bore, With her rose in his bosom glowing. One trooper he slew with his petronel, And one with his sword when his good steed fell, And they haled him, fighting, from horse and sell In the light of the beacon's burning. Quoth Hugh of the Hills,ââTo yonder tree Now hang him high where she may see; Then bear this rose and message from meâ âThe ravens feast at the turning.ââ BERTRAND DE BORN Knight and Troubadour, to his Lady the beautiful Maenz of Martagnac. The burden of the sometime years, That once my soul did overweigh, Falls from me, with its griefs and fears, When gazing in thine eyes of gray; Wherein, behold, like some bright ray Of dawn, thy heart's fond love appears, To cheer my life upon its way. Thine eyes! the daybreak of my heart! That give me strength to do and dare; Whose beauty is a radiant part Of all my songs; the music there; The morning, that makes dim each care, And glorifies my mind's dull mart, And helps my soul to do and dare. God, when He made thy fresh fair face, And thy young body, took the morn And made thee like a rose, whose race Is not of Earth; without a thorn, And dewed thee with the joy that 's born Of love, wherein hope hath its place Like to the star that heralds morn. I go my way through town and thorp: In court and hall and castle bower I tune my lute and strike my harp: And often from some twilight tower A lady drops to me a flower, That bids me scale the moat's steep scarp, And climb to love within her bower. I heed them not, but go my ways: What is their passion unto me! My songs are only in thy praise; Thy face alone it is I see, That fills my heart with melodyâ My sweet aubade! that makes my days All music, singing here in me! One time a foul knight in his towers Sneered thus: âGod's blood! why weary us With this one woman all our hours!â Sing of our wenches! amorous Yolande and Ysoarde here!âNot thus Shalt sing, but of our paramours!â What is thy Lady unto us!â And then I flung my lute aside; And from its baldric flew my sword; And down the hall 't was but a stride; And in his brute face and its word My gauntlet; and around the board The battle, till all wild-beast-eyed He lay and at his throat my sword. Thou dost remember in Provence The vile thing that I slew; and how With my good jongleurs and my lance Kept back his horde!âThe memory now Makes fierce my blood and hot my brow With rage.âAh, what a madman dance We led them, and escaped somehow! Oft times, when, in the tournament, I see thee sitting yet uncrowned; And bugles blow and spears are bent, And shields and falchions clash around, And steeds go crashing to the ground; And thou dost smile on me,âthough spent With war, again my soul is crowned: And I am fire to strike and slay; Before my face there comes a mist Of blood; and like a flame I play Through the loud lists; all who resist Go down like corn; until thy wrist, Kneeling, I kiss; the wreath they lay Of beauty on thy head's gold mist. And then I seize my lute and sing Some chanson or some wild aubade Full of thy beauty and the swing Of swords and love which I have had Of thee, until, with music mad, The lists reel with thy name and ring The echoed words of my aubade. I am thy knight and troubadour, Bertrand de Born, whom naught shall part From thee: who art my life's high lure, And wild bird of my wilder heart And all its music: yea, who art My soul's sweet sickness and its cure, From which, God grant! it ne'er shall part. THE TROUBADOUR, PONS DE CAPDEUIL In Provence, to his Lady, Azalis de MercÅur in Anjou The gray dawn finds me thinking still Of thee who hadst my thoughts all night; Of thee, who art my lute's sweet skill, And of my soul the only light; My star of song to whom I turn My face and for whose love I yearn. Thou dost not know thy troubadour Lies sick to death; no longer sings: That this alone may work his cureâ To feel thy white hand, weighed with rings, Smoothed softly through his heavy hair, Or resting with the old love there. To feel thy warm cheek laid to his; Thy bosom fluttering with love; Then on his eyes and lips thy kissâ Thy kiss alone were all enough To heal his heart, to cure his soul, And make his mind and body whole. The drought, these three months past, hath slain All green things in this weary land, As in my life thy high disdain Hath killed ambition: yea, my hand Forgets its cunning; and my heart, Sick to stagnation, all its art. Once to my castle there at Puy, In honor of thy beauty, came The Angevin nobility, To hear me sing of thee, whose fame Was high as Helen's.âAzalis, Hast thou forgot? Forget'st thou this? And in the lists how often there I broke a spear for thee? and placed The crown of beauty on thy hair, While thou sat'st, like the fair moon faced, Amid the human firmament Of faces that toward thee bent. I take my hawk, my peregrineâ No falconer or page besideâ And ride from morn till eve begin; I ride forgetting that I ride, And all save this: that thou no more Dost ride beside me as of yore. A heron sweeps above me: I Remember then how oft were cast Thy hawk and mine at such: and sigh Thinking of thee and days long past, When through the Anjou fields and bowers We used to hawk and hunt for hours. And when, unhappy, I return, And take my lute and seek again The terrace where, beside some urn, The castle gathers,âwhile the stain Of sunset crimsons all the sea,â And sing old songs once loved of thee: The soul within me overflows With longing; and I seem to hear Thy voice through fountains and the rose Calling afar, while, wildly near, The rossignol makes mute my tongue With memories of things long sung. Here in Provence I pine for thee; And there in Anjou dost forget!â All beauty here is less to me Than is the ribbon lightly set At thy white throat; or, on thy foot, The shoe that I have loved to lute. Thy foot, that I have loved to kiss; To kiss and sing of!âSong hath died In me since then, my Azalis; Since to my soul e'en that 's denied: Thy kiss, that now alone could cure The sick heart of thy Troubadour. THE OLD HOME An old lane, an old gate, an old house by a tree; A wild wood, a wild brookâthey will not let me be: In boyhood I knew them, and still they call to me. Down deep in my heart's core I hear them and my eyes Through tear-mists behold them beneath the old-time skies, 'Mid bee-boom and rose-bloom and orchard-lands arise. I hear them; and heartsick with longing is my soul, To walk there, to dream there, beneath the sky's blue bowl; Around me, within me, the weary world made whole. To talk with the wild brook of all the long-ago; To whisper the wood-wind of things we used to know When we were old companions, before my heart knew woe. To walk with the morning and watch its rose unfold; To drowse with the noontide lulled on its heart of gold; To lie with the night-time and dream the dreams of old. To tell to the old trees, and to each listening leaf, The longing, the yearning, as in my boyhood brief, The old hope, the old love, would ease me of my grief. The old lane, the old gate, the old house by the tree; The wild wood, the wild brookâthey will not let me be: In boyhood I knew them, and still they call to me. THE OLD HERB-MAN On the barren hillside lone he sat; On his head he wore a tattered hat; In his hand he bore a crooked staff; Never heard I laughter like his laugh, On the barren hillside, thistle-hoar. Cracked his laughter sounded, harsh as woe, As the croaking, thinned, of a crow: At his back hung, pinned, a wallet old, Bulged with roots and simples caked with mould: On the barren hillside in the wind. Roots of twisted twin-leaf; sassafras; Bloodroot, tightly whipped round with grass; Adder's-tongue; and, tipped brown and black, Yellowroot and snakeroot filled his pack, On the barren hillside, winter-stripped. There is nothing sadder than old age; Nothing saddens more than that stage When, forlornly poor, bent with toil, One must starve or wring life from the soil, From the barren hillside, wild and hoar. Down the barren hillside slow he went, Cursing at the cold, bowed and bent; With his bag of mold, herbs and roots, In his clay-stained garments, clay-caked boots, Down the barren hillside, poor and old. THE SOLITARY Upon the mossed rock by the spring She sits, forgetful of her pail, Lost in remote remembering Of that which may no more avail. Her thin, pale hair is dimly dressed Above a brow lined deep with care, The color of a leaf long pressed, A faded leaf that once was fair. You may not know her from the stone So still she sits who does not stir, Thinking of this one thing aloneâ The love that never came to her. What though I dreamed of mountain heights, Of peaks, the barriers of the world, Around whose tops the Northern Lights And tempests are unfurled! Mine are the footpaths leading through Life's lowly fields and woods,âwith rifts, Above, of heaven's Eden blue,â By which the violet lifts Its shy appeal; and, holding up Its chaliced gold, like some wild wine, Along the hillside, cup on cup, Blooms bright the celandine. Where soft upon each flowering stock The butterfly spreads damask wings; And under grassy loam and rock The cottage cricket sings. Where, overhead, eve blooms with fire, In which the new moon bends her bow, And, arrow-like, one white star by her Burns through the afterglow. I care not, so the sesame I find; the magic flower there, Whose touch unseals each mystery In water, earth and air. Which, in the oak-tree, lets me hear Its heart's deep speech, its soul's wise words; And to my mind makes crystal clear The melodies of birds. Why should I care, who live aloof, Beyond the din of life and dust, While dreams still share my humble roof, And love makes sweet my crust? [FOOTPATHS] ELFIN I When wildflower blue and wildflower white The wildflowers lay their heads together, And the moon-moth glimmers along the night, And the wandering firefly flares its light, And the full moon rises broad and bright, Then, then it is elfin weather. II And fern and flower on top of the hill Are a fairy wood where the fairies camp; And there, to the pipe of the cricket shrill, And the owl's bassoon or the whippoorwill, They whirl their wildest and trip their fill By the light of the glow-worm's lamp. III And the mottled toad and the katydid Are the henchmen set to guard their dance; At whose cry they creep 'neath the dewy lid Of a violet's eye, or close lie hid In a bluebell's ear, if a mortal 'mid The moonlit woods should chance. IV And the forest-fly with its gossamer wings, And filmy body of rainbow dye, Is the ouphen steed each elfin brings, Whereon by the light of the stars he swings, When the dance is done and the barn-cock sings, And the dim dawn streaks the sky. AUTHORITIES The unpretentious flowers of the woods, That rise in bright and banded brotherhoods, Waving us welcome, and with kisses sweet Laying their lives down underneath our feet, Lesson my soul more than the tomes of man, Packed with the lore of ages, ever can, In love and truth, hope and humility, And such unselfishness as to the bee, Lifting permissive petals dripping nard, Yields every sweet up, asking no reward. The many flowers of wood and field and stream, Filling our hearts with wonder and with dream, That know no ceremony, yet that are Attended of such reverence as that starâ That punctual point of flame, which, to our eyes, Leads on the vast procession of the skies, Sidereal silver, glittering in the westâ Compels, assertive of heaven's loveliest. Where may one find suggestion simpler set Than in the radius of a violet? Or more authentic loveliness than glows In the small compass of a single rose? Or more of spiritual thought than perfumes from The absolute purity of a lily-bloom? THE WILLOW WATER Deep in the hollow wood he found a way Winding unto a water, dim and gray, Grayer and dimmer than the break of day; By which a wildrose blossomed; flower on flower Leaning above its image hour on hour, Musing, it seemed, on its own loveliness, And longing with sweet longing to express Some thought to its reflection. Dropping now Bee-shaken pollen from the voluble bough, And now a petal, delicate as a blush, It seemed to sigh or whisper to the hush The dreams, the myths and marvels it had seen Tip-toeing dimly through the woodland green: Faint shapes of fragrance; forms like flowers, that go Footing the moss; or, shouldered with moonbeam glow, Through starlit waves oaring an arm of snow. He sat him down and gazed into the pool: And as he gazed, two petals, silken cool, Fell, soft as starbeams fall that arrow through The fern-hung trembling of a drop of dew; And, pearly-placid, on the water lay, Two curves of languid ruby, where, green-gray, The shadow of a willow dimmed the stream. And suddenly he sawâor did he dream He saw?âthe rose-leaves change to rosy lips, A laughing crimson. And, with silvery hips, And eyes of luminous emerald, full of sleep And all the stillness of the under deep, The shadow of the tree become a girl, A shadowy girl, who shook from many a curl Faint, tangled glimmerings of shell and pearl. A girl who called him, beckoned him to come, Waving a hand whiter than moonlit foam, And pointing, minnowy fingered, to her homeâ A bubble, rainbow-built, beneath the wave, Dim-domed, and murmurous as the deep-sea cave, Columned of coral and of grottoed foam, Where the pale mermaids never cease to comb Their weed-green hair with fingers crystal-cold, Sighing forever round the Sea King old Throned on his throne of shell and ribbÃ©d gold. Laughing, she lured him, lipped like some wild-rose; Bidding him follow; come to her; repose Upon her bosom and forever dream Lulled by the wandering whisper of the stream. But him mortality weighed heavily on And earthly love: and, sorrowful and wan, He shook his head, motioning âI can not riseâ; But still he felt the magic of her eyes Drawing him to her; felt her hands of foam Around his heart; her lips, that bade him come With smiling witchery, and with laughing looks Like those that lured us in the fairy books Our childhood dreamed on. . . . Then, as suddenly, A wind, it seemed, from nowhere he could see, Wrinkled the water; ruffled its smooth glass; And there again, behold! when it did pass The rose-leaves lay and shadow, dimly seen; The willow's shadow, and no thing between. ELUSION I My soul goes out to her who says, âCome follow me and cast off care!â Then tosses back her sunbright hair, And like a flower before me sways Between the green leaves and my gaze: This creature like a girl, who smiles Into my eyes and softly lays Her hand in mine and leads me miles, Long miles of haunted forest ways. II Sometimes she seems a faint perfume, A fragrance that a flower exhaled And God gave form to; now, unveiled, A sunbeam making gold the gloom Of vines that roof some woodland room Of boughs; and now the silvery sound Of streams her presence doth assumeâ Music, from which, in dreaming drowned, A crystal shadow she seems to bloom. III Sometimes she seems the light that lies On foam of waters where the fern Shimmers and drips; now, at some turn Of woodland, bright against the skies, She seems the rainbowed mist that flies; And now the mossy fire that breaks Beneath the feet in azure eyes Of flowers; and now the wind that shakes Pale petals from the bough that sighs. IV Sometimes she lures me with a song; Sometimes she guides me with a laugh; Her white hand is a magic staff, Her look a spell to lead me long: Though she be weak and I be strong, She needs but shake her happy hair, But glance her eyes, and, right or wrong, My soul must followâanywhere She willsâfar from the world's loud throng. V Sometimes I think that she must be No part of earth, but merely thisâ The fair, elusive thing we miss In Nature, that we dream we see Yet never see: that goldenly Beckons; that, limbed with rose and pearl, The Greek made a divinity:â A nymph, a god, a glimmering girl, That haunts the forest's mystery. THE LOST GARDEN Roses, brier on brier, Like a hedge of fire, Walled it from the world and rolled Crimson round it; manifold Blossoms, 'mid which once of old Walked my Heart's Desire. There the golden Hours Dwelt; and 'mid the bowers Beauty wandered like a maid; And the Dreams that never fade Sat within its haunted shade Gazing at the flowers. There the winds that vary Melody and marry Perfume unto perfume, went, Whispering to the buds, that bent, Messages whose wonderment Made them sweet to carry. There the waters hoary Murmured many a story To the leaves that leaned above, Listening to their tales of love, While the happiness thereof Flushed their green with glory. There the sunset's shimmer 'Mid the bowers,âdimmer Than the woods where Fable dwells, And Romance her legends tells,â Wrought dim dreams and dimmer spells, Filled with golden glimmer. There at night the wonder Of the moon would sunder Foliage deeps with breast of pearl, Wandering like a glimmering girl, Fair of form and bright of curl, Through the trees and under. There the stars would follow, Over hill and hollow, Spirit shapes that danced the dew From frail cups of sparry hue; Firefly forms that fleeter flew Than the fleetest swallow. There my heart made merry; There, 'mid bloom and berry, Dreamed the dreams that are no more, In that garden lost of yore, Set in seas, without a shore, That no man may ferry. Where perhaps her lyre,â Wreathed with serest brier,â Sorrow strikes now; sad its gold Sighing where, 'mid roses old, Fair of face and dead and cold Lies my Heart's Desire. LATE OCTOBER WOODS Clumped in the shadow of the beech,â In whose brown top the crows are loud,â Where, every side, great briers reach And cling like hands,âthe beech drops crowd The mossy cirque with neutral tints Of gray; and deep, with berries bowed, The buckbush reddens 'mid the mints. O'erhead the forest scarcely stirs: The wind is laid: the sky is blue: Bush-clover, with its links of burrs, And some last blooms,âfew, pink of hue,â Makes wild the way: and everywhere Slim, white-ribbed cones of fungi strew The grass that 's like a wildman's hair. The jewel-weeds, whose pods bombard The hush with fairy batteries Of seeds, grow dense here; pattering hard Their sacs explode, persuade the eyes To search the heaven for show'rs:âOne seems To walk where old Enchantment plies Her shuttle of lost days and dreams. And, lo! yon rock of fern and flower, That heaves its height from bramble deeps, All on a sudden seems the tower Wherein the Sleeping Beauty sleeps: And that red vine the fire-drake, The flaming dragon, is, that keeps The world from her no man may wake. IN THE BEECH WOODS Amber and emerald, cairngorm and chrysoprase, Stream through the autumn woods, scatter the beech-wood ways: Ways where the wahoo-bush brightens with scarlet; And where the aster-stalk lifts its last starlet. Ways where the brier burns; poplars drop, one by one, Leaves that seem beaten gold, each like a splash of sun: Round which the beeches rise, tree upon golden tree, That, with each wind that blows, sound like a summer sea. Ways where the papaw leans, great-leaved and beryl-green, Like some grand forester one in Romance hath seen; And like some Indian queen, sung of in story, Flaming the gum-tree stands, crowned with its glory. Ways where the bittersweet, cleaving its pods of gold, Brightens the brake with flame, torches the dingle old: And where the dogwood, too, crimsons with ruby seeds; Spicewood and buckbush bend ruddy with rosy beads. These are the woods of gold; forests our childhood knew, Where the Enchanted dwelt, she with the eyes of blue; She of the raven locks, and of the lovely looks, She who oft gazed at us out of the Story Books. And with that Prince again, striding his snow-white steed, To her deliverance through the gold wood we speed; On through the wood of flame to the Dark Tower, Where like a light she gleams high in her bower. THE WORD IN THE WOOD I The acorn-oak Sullens to sombre crimson all its leaves; And where it hugely heaves A giant head dark as congested blood, The gum-tree towers, against the sky a stroke Of purpling gold; and every blur of wood Is color on the pallet that she drops, The Autumn, dreaming on the hazed hilltops. II And as I went Through golden forests in a golden land, Where Magic waved her wand And dimmed the air with dreams my boyhood knew, Enchantment met me; and again she bent Her face to mine, and smiled with eyes of blue, And kissed me on the mouth and bade me heed Old tales again from books no man may read. III And at her word The wood became transfigured; and, behold! With hair of wavy gold A presence walked there; and its beauty was The beauty not of Earth: and then I heard Within my heart vague voices, murmurous And multitudinous as leaves that sow The firmament when winds of autumn blow. IV And I perceived The voices were but one voice made of sighs, That sorrowed in this wise: âI am the child-soul that grew up and died, The child-soul of the world that once believed, Believed in me, but long ago denied; The Faery Faith it needs no more to-day, The folk-lore Beauty long since passed away.â THE NIGHT-WIND I I have heard the wind on a winter's night, When the snow-cold moon looked icily through My window's flickering firelight, Where the frost his witchery drew: I have heard the wind on a winter's night, Wandering ways that were frozen white, Wail in my chimney-flue: And its voice was the voice,âso it seemed to me,â The voice of the world's vast misery. II I have heard the wind on a night of spring, When the leaves unclasped their girdles of gold, And the bird on the bough sang slumbering, In the lilac's fragrant fold: I have heard the wind on a night of spring, Shaking the musk from its dewy wing, Sigh in my garden old: And it seemed that it said, as it sighed above, âI am the voice of the Earth's great love.â III I have heard the wind on a night of fall, When a devil's-dance was the rain's down-pour, And the wild woods reeled to its demon call, And the carpet fluttered the floor: I have heard the wind on a night of fall, Heaping the leaves by the garden wall, Weep at my close-shut door: And its voice, so it seemed, as it sorrowed there, Was the old, old voice of the world's despair. IV I have heard the wind on a summer night, When the myriad stars stormed heaven with fire, And the moon-moth glimmered in phantom flight, And the crickets creaked in choir: I have heard the wind on a summer night, Rocking the red rose and the white, Murmur in bloom and brier: And its voice was the voice,âso it seemed to me,â Of Earth's primordial mystery. GOD'S GREEN BOOK I Out, out in the open fields, Where the great, green book of God,â The book that its wisdom yields To each soul that is not a clod,â Lies wide for the world to read, I would go; and in flower and weed, That letter the lines of the grass, Would read of a better creed Than that which the town-world has. II Too long in the city streets, The alleys of grime and sin, Have I heard the iron beats Of the heart of toil; whose din, And the throb of whose wild unrest Have stunned the song in my breast, Have marred its music and slain The bird that was once its guest, And my soul would find it again. III Out there where the great, green book, Whose leaves are the grass and trees, Lies open; where each may look, May muse and read as he please; The book, that is gilt with gleams, Whose pages are ribboned with streams; That says what our souls would say Of beauty that 's wrought of dreams And buds and blossoms of May. A WET DAY Dark, drear, and drizzly, with vapor grizzly, The day goes dully unto its close; Its wet robe smutches each thing it touches, Its fingers sully and wreck the rose. Around the railing and garden-paling The dripping lily hangs low its head: A brood-mare whinnies; and hens and guineas Droop, damp and chilly, beneath the shed. In splashing mire about the byre The cattle huddle, the farm-hand plods; While to some neighbor's a wagon labors Through pool and puddle and clay that clods. The day, unsplendid, at last is ended, Is dead and buried, and night has come;â Night, blind and footless, and foul and fruitless, With weeping wearied, and sorrow-dumb. Ah, God! for thunder! for winds to sunder The clouds and o'er us smite rushing bars! And through wild masses of storm, that passes, Roll calm the chorus of moon and stars. AFTER STORM Great clouds of sullen seal and gold Bar bleak the tawny west, From which all day the thunder rolled, And storm streamed, crest on crest. Now silvery in its deeps of bronze The new moon fills its sphere; And point by point the darkness dons Its pale stars there and here. But still behind the moon and stars, The peace of heaven remains Suspicion of the wrath that wars, That Nature now restrains. As, lined 'neath tiger eyelids, glare The wild-beast eyes that sleep, So smoulders in its sunset lair The rage that rent the deep. SUNSET ON THE RIVER I A sea of onyx are the skies, Cloud-islanded with fire; Such nacre-colored flame as dyes A sea-shell's rosy spire; And at its edge one star sinks slow, Burning, into the overglow. II Save for the cricket in the grass, Or passing bird that twitters, The world is hushed. Like liquid glass The soundless river glitters Between the hills that hug and hold Its beauty like a hoop of gold. III The glory deepens; and, meseems, A vasty canvas, painted With revelations of God's dreams And visions symbol-sainted, The west is, that each night-cowled hill Kneels down before in worship still. IV There is no thing to wake unrest; No sight or sound to jangle The peace that evening in the breast Brings, smoothing out the tangle Of gnarls and knots of care and strife That snarl the colored cord of life. TABERNACLES The little tents the wildflowers raise Are tabernacles where Love prays And Beauty preaches all the days. I walk the woodland through and through, And everywhere I see their blue And gold where I may worship too. All hearts unto their inmost shrine Of fragrance they invite; and mine Enters and sees the All Divine. I hark; and with some inward ear Soft words of praise and prayer I hear, And bow my head and have no fear. For God is present as I see In them; and gazes out at me Kneeling to His divinity. Oh, holiness that Nature knows, That dwells within each thing that grows, Vestured with dreams, as is the rose With perfume! whereof all things preachâ The birds, the brooks, the leaves that reach Our hearts and souls with loving speech; That makes a tabernacle of The flow'rs; whose priests are Truth and Love, Who help our souls to rise above The Earth and that which we name sin, Unto the knowledge, that is kin To Heaven, to which at last we win. THE CAT-BIRD I The tufted gold of the sassafras, And the gold of the spicewood-bush, Bewilder the ways of the forest pass, And brighten the underbrush: The white-starred drifts of the wild-plum tree, And the haw with its pearly plumes, And the redbud, misted rosily, Dazzle the woodland glooms. II And I hear the song of the cat-bird wake I' the boughs o' the gnarled wild-crab, Or there where the snows of the dogwood shake, That the silvery sunbeams stab: And it seems to me that a magic lies In the crystal sweet of its notes, That a myriad blossoms open their eyes As its strain above them floats. III I see the bluebell's blue unclose, And the trillium's stainless white; The bird-foot violet's purple and rose, And the poppy, golden-bright! And I see the eyes of the bluet wink, And the heads of the white-hearts nod; And the baby mouths of the woodland pink And the sorrel salute the sod. IV And this, meseems, does the cat-bird say, As the blossoms crowd i' the sun:â âUp, up! and out! oh, out and away! Up, up! and out, each one! Sweethearts! sweethearts! oh, sweet, sweet, sweet! Come listen and hark to me! The Spring, the Spring, with her fragrant feet, Is passing this way!âOh, hark to the beat Of her bee-like heart!âOh, sweet, sweet, sweet! Come! open your eyes and see! See, see, see!â DAYS COME AND GO Leaves fall and flowers fade, Days come and go: Now is sweet Summer laid Low in her leafy glade, Low like a fragrant maid, Low, low, ah, low. Tears fall and eyelids ache, Hearts overflow: Here for our dead love's sake Let us our farewells makeâ Will he again awake? Ah, no, no, no. Winds sigh and skies are gray, Days come and go: Wild birds are flown away: Where are the blooms of May?â Dead, dead, this many a day, Under the snow. Lips sigh and cheeks are pale, Hearts overflow: Will not some song or tale, Kiss, or a flower frail, With our dead love avail?â Ah, no, no, no. THE WANING YEAR A sense of something that is sad and strange; Of something that is felt as death is felt,â As shadows, phantoms, in a haunted grange,â Around me seems to melt. It rises, so it seems, from the decay Of the dim woods; from withered leaves and weeds, And dead flowers hanging by the woodland way Sad, hoary heads of seeds. And from the cricket's song,âso feeble now 'T is like a sound heard in the heart, a call Dreamier than dreams;âand from the shaken bough, And acorns' drowsy fall. From scents and sounds it rises, sadly slow, This presence, that hath neither face nor form; That in the woods sits like demented woe, Whispering of wreck and storm. A presence wrought of melancholy grief, And dreams that die; that, in the streaming night, I shall behold, like some fantastic leaf, Beat at my window's light. That I shall hear, outside my storm-lashed door, Moan like the wind in some rain-tortured tree; Or round my roof and down my chimney roar All the wild night to me. GRAY NOVEMBER I Dull, dimly gleaming, The dawn looks downward Where, flowing townward, The river, steaming With mist, is hidden: Each bush, that huddles Beside the road,âthe rain has pooled with puddles,â Seems, in the fog, a hag or thing hag-ridden. II Where leaves hang tattered In forest tangles, And woodway angles Are acorn-scattered, Coughing and yawning The woodsman slouches, Or stands as silent as the hound that crouches Beside him, ghostly in the mist-drenched dawning. III Through roses, rotting Within the garden,â With blooms, that harden, Of marigolds, knotting, (Each one an ember Dull, dead and dripping,) Her brow, from which their faded wreath is slipping, Mantled in frost and fog, comes in November. WHAT OF IT THEN I Well, what of it then, if your heart be weighed with the yoke Of the world's neglect? and the smoke Of doubt, blown into your eyes, makes night of your road? And the sting of the goad, The merciless goad of scorn, And the rise and fall Of the whip of necessity gall, Till your heart, forlorn, Indignant, in rage would rebel? And your bosom fill, And sobbingly swell, With bitterness, yea, against God and 'gainst Fate, Fate, and the world of men, What of it then? . . . Let it be as it will, If you labor and wait, You, too, will arrive, and the end for you, too, will be well. What of it then, say I! yea, what of it then! II Well, what of it then? if the hate of the world and of men Make wreck of your dreams again? What of it then If contumely and sneer, And ignorant jibe and jeer, Be heaped upon all that you do and dream: And the irresistible stream Of events overwhelm and submerge All effortâor so it may seem? Not all, not all shall be lost, Not all, in the merciless gurge And pitiless surge!â Though you see it tempestuously tossed, Though you see it sink down or sweep by, Not in vain did you strive, not in vain! The struggle, the longing and toil Of hand and of heart and of brain, Not in vain was it all, say I! For out of the wild turmoil And seething and soil Of Time, some part of the whole will arise, Arise and remain, In spite of the wrath of the skies And the hate of men.â What of it then, say I! yea, what of it then! WOMANHOOD I The summer takes its hue From something opulent as fair in her, And the bright heav'n is brighter than it was; Brighter and lovelier, Arching its beautiful blue, Serene and soft, as her sweet gaze, o'er us. II The springtime takes its moods From something in her made of smiles and tears, And flowery earth is flowerier than before, And happier, it appears, Adding new multitudes To flowers, like thoughts, that haunt us evermore. III Summer and spring are wed In herâher nature; and the glamour of Their loveliness, their bounty, as it were, Of life, and joy, and love, Her being seems to shed, The magic aura of the heart of her. THE ROSE'S SECRET When down the west the new moon slipped, A curved canoe that dipped and tipped, When from the rose the dewdrop dripped, As if it shed its heart's blood slow; As softly silent as a star I climbed a lattice that I know, A window lattice, held ajar By one slim hand as white as snow: The hand of her who set me here, A rose, to bloom from year to year. I, who have heard the bird of June Sing all night long beneath the moon; I, who have heard the zephyr croon Soft music 'mid spring's avenues, Heard then a sweeter sound than these, Among the shadows and the dewsâ A heart that beat like any bee's, Sweet with a nameâand I know whose: Her heart that, leaning, pressed on me, A rose, she never looked to see. O star and moon! O wind and bird! Ye harkened, too, but never heard The secret sweet, the whispered word I heard, when by her lips his name Was murmured.âThen she saw me there!â But that I heard was I to blame? Whom in the darkness of her hair She thrust since I had heard the same: Condemned within its deeps to lie, A rose, imprisoned till I die. THE HUSHED HOUSE I, who went at nightfall, came again at dawn; On Love's door again I knocked.âLove was gone. He who oft had bade me in, now would bid no more; Silence sat within his house; barred its door. When the slow door opened wide through it I could see How the emptiness within stared at me. Through the dreary chambers, long I sought and sighed, But no answering footstep came; naught replied. Then at last I entered, dim, a darkened room: There a taper glimmered gray in the gloom. And I saw one lying crowned with helichrys; Never saw I face as fair as was his. Like a wintry lily was his brow in hue; And his cheeks were each a rose, wintry, too. Then my soul remembered all that made us part, And what I had laughed at onceâbroke my heart. UNFORGOTTEN I How many things, that we would remember, Sweet or sad, or great or small, Do our minds forget! and how one thing only, One little thing endures o'er all! For many things have I forgotten, But this one thing can never forgetâ The scent of a primrose, woodland-wet, Long years ago I found in a far land; A fragile flower that April set, Rainy pink, in her forehead's garland. II How many things by the heart are forgotten! Sad or sweet, or little or great! And how one thing that could mean nothing Stays knocking still at the heart's red gate! For many things has my heart forgotten, But this one thing can never forgetâ The face of a girl, a moment met, Who smiled in my eyes; whom I passed in pity; A flower-like face, with weeping wet, Flung to the streets of a mighty city. UNSUCCESS A modern Poet addresses his Muse, to whom he has devoted the best Years of his Life I Not here, O belovÃ©d! not here let us part, in the city, but there! Out there where the storm can enfold us, on the hills, where its breast is made bare: Its breast, that is rainy and cool as the fern that drips by the fall In the luminous night of the woodland where winds to the waters call. Not here, O belovÃ©d! not here! but there! out there in the storm! The rush and the reel of the heavens, the tempest, whose rapturous arm Shall seize us and sweep us together,âresistless as passions seize men,â Through the rocking world of the woodland, with its multitude music, and then, With the rain on our lips, belovÃ©d! in the heart of the night's wild hell, One last, long kiss forever, and forever and ever farewell. II I am sick of the madness of men; of the bootless struggle and strife: Of the pain and the patience of waiting; the scoff and the scorning of life: I am sick of the shapes and the shadows; the sins and the sorrows that crowd The gateways of heart and of brain; of the laughter, the shout that is loud In the mouth of SuccessâSuccess, that was never for me, ah me!â And all the wrong and neglect that are heaped, belovÃ©d, on thee! I am sick of the whining of failure; the boast and the brag of Success; The vainness of effort and longing; the dreams and the days that oppress: I am sick of them all; but am sickest, am sickest in body and soul, Of the love that I bear thee, belovÃ©d! and only thy death can make whole. III Imperfect, imperfect God made us,âor the power that men call God.â And I think that a Power so perfect, that made us with merely a nod, Could have fashioned us beings less faulty; more able to wear and to bear; Less open to mar and to fracture; less filled with the stuff of despair: Less damned with the unavailing; less empty of all good thingsâ The hopes and the dreams that mature not while the clay still to them clings: I am sick of it all, belovÃ©d! of the world and the ways of God; The thorns that have pierced thy bosom; the shards of the paths we have trod: I am sick of going and coming; and of love I am sickest of all: The striving, the praying, the dreaming; and the things that never befall.â So there in the storm and the darkness,âO fair, and O fugitive!â Out there in the night, belovÃ©d, must thou die so I may live! THE FIRST QUARTER I January Shaggy with skins of frost-furred gray and drab, Harsh, hoary hair framing a bitter face, He bends above the dead Year's fireplace Nursing the last few embers of its slab To sullen glow: from pinched lips, cold and crab, The starved flame shrinks; his breath, like a menÃ¡ce, Shrieks in the flue, fluttering its sooty lace, Piercing the silence like an icy stab. From rheum-gnarled knees he rises, slow with cold, And to the frost-bound window, muttering, goes, With iron knuckles knocking on the pane; And, lo! outside, his minions manifold Answer the summons: wolf-like shapes of woe, Hunger and suffering, trooping to his train. II February Gray-muffled to his eyes in rags of cloud, His whip of winds forever in his hand, Driving the herded storms along the land,â That shake the wild sleet from wild hair and crowd Heaven with tumultuous bulks,âhe comes, low-browed And heavy-eyed; the hail, like stinging sand, Whirls white behind, swept backward by his band Of wild-hoofed gales that o'er the world ring loud. All day the tatters of his dark cloak stream Congealing moisture, till in solid ice The forests stand; and, clang on thunderous clang, All night is heard,âas in the moon's cold gleam Tightens his grip of frost, his iron vise,â The boom of bursting boughs that icicles fang. III March This is the tomboy month of all the year, March, who comes shouting o'er the winter hills, Waking the world with laughter, as she wills, Or wild halloos, a windflower in her ear. She stops a moment by the half-thawed mere And whistles to the wind, and straightway shrills The hyla's song, and hoods of daffodils Crowd golden round her, leaning their heads to hear. Then through the woods, that drip with all their eaves, Her mad hair blown about her, loud she goes Singing and calling to the naked trees, And straight the oilets of the little leaves Open their eyes in wonder, rows on rows, And the first bluebird bugles to the breeze. ZERO The gate, on ice-hoarse hinges, stiff with frost, Croaks open; and harsh wagon-wheels are heard Creaking through cold; the horses' breath is furred Around their nostrils; and with snow deep-mossed The hut is barely seen, from which, uptossed, The wood-smoke pillars the icy air unstirred; And every sound, each axe-stroke and each word, Comes as through crystal, then again is lost. The sun strikes bitter on the frozen pane, And all around there is a tingling,âtense As is a wire stretched upon a disk Vibrating without sound:âIt is the strain That Winter plays, to which each tree and fence, It seems, is strung, as 't were of ringing bisque. ON THE HILLTOP. There is no inspiration in the view. From where this acorn drops its thimbles brown The landscape stretches like a shaggy frown; The wrinkled hills hang haggard and harsh of hue: Above them hollows the heaven's stony blue, Like a dull thought that haunts some sleep-dazed clown Plodding his homeward way; and, whispering down, The dead leaves dance, a sere and shelterless crew. Let the sick day stagger unto its close, Morose and mumbling, like a hoary crone Beneath her faggotsâhuddled fogs that soon Shall flare the windy west with ashen glows, Like some deep, dying hearth; and let the lone Night come at lastânight, and its withered moon. AUTUMN STORM The wind is rising and the leaves are swept Wildly before it, hundreds on hundreds fall Huddling beneath the trees. With brag and brawl Of storm the day is grown a tavern, kept Of madness, where, with mantles torn and ripped Of flying leaves that beat above it all, The wild winds fight; and, like some half-spent ball, The acorn stings the rout; and, silver-stripped, The milkweed-pod winks an exhausted lamp: Now, in his coat of tatters dark that streams, The ragged rain sweeps stormily this way, With all his clamorous followersâclouds that camp Around the hearthstone of the west where gleams The last chill flame of the expiring day. THE JONGLEUR Last night I lay awake and heard the wind, That madman jongleur of the world of air, Making wild music: now he seemed to fare With harp and lute, so intimately twinned They were as one; now on a drum he dinned, Now on a tabor; now, with blow and blare Of sackbut and recorder, everywhere Shattered the night; then on a sudden thinned To bagpipe wailings as of maniac grief That whined itself to sleep. And then, meseemed, Out in the darkness, mediÃ¦val-dim, I saw him dancing, like an autumn leaf, In tattered tunic, while around him streamed His lute's wild ribbons 'thwart the moon's low rim. OLD SIR JOHN Bald, with old eyes a blood-shot blue, he comes Into the Boar's Head Inn: the hot sweat streaks His fulvous face, and all his raiment reeks Of all the stews and all the Eastcheap slums. Upon the battered board again he drums And croaks for sack: then sits, his harsh-haired cheeks Sunk in his hands, rough with the grime of weeks, While round the tap one great bluebottle hums. All, all are gone, the old companionsâthey Who made his rogue's world merry: of them all Not one is left. Old, toothless now, and gray, Alone he waits: the swagger of that day Gone from his bulkâdeparted even as Doll, And he, his Hal, who broke his heart, they say. IN AGES PAST I stood upon a height and listened to The solemn psalmody of many pines, And with the sound I seemed to see long lines Of mountains rise, blue peak on cloudy blue, And hear the roar of torrents hurling through Riven ravines; or from the crags' gaunt spines Pouring wild hair, where,âas an eyeball shines,â A mountain pool shone, clear and cold of hue. And then my soul rememberedâfelt, how once, In ages past, 't was here that I, a Faun, Startled an Oread at her morning bath, Who stood revealed; her beauty, like the sun's, Veiled in her hair, heavy with dews of dawn, Through which, like stars, burnt blue her eyes' bright wrath. THE MISER Withered and gray as winter; gnarled and old, With bony hands he crouches by the coals; His beggar's coat is patched and worn in holes; Rags are his shoes: clutched in his claw-like hold A chest he hugs wherein he hoards his gold. Far-heard a bell of midnight slowly tolls: The bleak blasts shake his hut like wailing souls, And door and window chatter with the cold. Nor sleet nor snow he heeds, nor storm nor night. Let the wind howl! and let the palsy twitch His rheum-racked limbs! here 's that will make them glow And warm his heart! here 's comfort, joy and light!â How the gold glistens!âRich he is; how richâ Only the death that knocks outside shall know. UNTO WHAT END Unto what end, I ask, unto what end Is all this effort, this unrest and toil? Work that avails not? strife and mad turmoil? Ambitions vain that rack our hearts and rend? Did labor but avail! did it defend The soul from its despair, who would recoil From sweet endeavor then? work that were oil To still the storms that in the heart contend! But still to see all effort valueless! To toil in vain year after weary year At Song! beholding every other Art Considered more than Song's high holiness,â The difficult, the beautiful and dear!â Doth break my heart, ah God! doth break my heart! EPILOGUE We have worshipped two gods from our earliest youth, Soul of my soul and heart of me! Young forever and true as truthâ The gods of Beauty and Poesy. Sweet to us are their tyrannies, Sweet their chains that have held us long, For God's own self is a part of these, Part of our gods of Beauty and Song. What to us if the world revile! What to us if its heart rejects! It may scorn our gods, or curse with a smile, The gods we worship, that it neglects: Nothing to us is its blessing or curse; Less than nothing its hate and wrong: For Love smiles down through the universe Smiles on our gods of Beauty and Song. We go our ways: and the dreams we dream, People our path and cheer us on; And ever before is the golden gleam, The star we follow, the streak of dawn: Nothing to us is the word men say; For a wiser word still keeps us strong, God's word, that makes fine fire of clay, That shaped our gods of Beauty and Song.</field>
