Here is Clara with Susannah, And Alexander following Hannah, Here's Nathaniel come to meet me, And Valeria runs to greet me, Now Amanda trips before, Daniel, and Emma, and some more; Robert and Ephraim skipping too, And Richard, with his “How d'ye do.” Octavus hastens full of fun,— Here Caroline and Julia run.

Humphrey, Lawrence, Jacob too, And after Louis master Hugh, Owen, and Patrick;—are these all? Oh no; here Walter comes with Paul, And hand in hand with little Annie, My darling neighbour, black-eyed Fanny. Now girls and boys, go read your book, And on the pretty pictures look; I hope you'll take as much delight in Reading, as I have in writing. INVITATION TO A BIRD. Little bird come Quick to my home, I'll give you to eat, Every thing sweet; Sugar and cake, I'll save for your sake; Melon and plum, You shall have some; A peach and a pear, And every thing rare; Some straw for your nest, And what you like best; A nice little house, As snug as a mouse. Come away from the tree, And live here with me; I will give you a brush, To smooth down each feather, And brother shall hush, While we sing together. Come away from the tree, And live here with me. THE LITTLE BIRD'S ANSWER. I thank you, my dear, But I'd rather live here: The skies they are fair And I love the fresh air. The trees they are green, And I sit like a queen, On a branch as it goes, While the pleasant wind blows. I have more on my table To eat than I'm able, For the very large field My dessert does yield: But come from your book, With a good humour'd look, When with care you have read, And your lesson is said; Sit under the tree, With your sewing by me, And this afternoon, I'll sing you a tune. THE BIRTH-DAY. Try me, father, try me, And mark me on the wall; Let little Sis stand by me And see if I'm not tall. Hear me, mother, hear me, How very well I read; Ah, now, you need not fear me, I know I can indeed. Come, meet me, brother, meet me, And let us run a race; Last year you used to beat me, In every little chase. Oh nurse, you need not mind me, I'm not so very small, That you must walk behind me, To catch me if I fall. Why, what can make me grow so, And talk in such a way? I'm a man, and you must know so, For I'm five years old to-day. THE BEETLE. A very cruel amusement among some children, is, to catch a kind of beetle sometimes called Fig-eater, tie it by the leg with a thread, and then let it fly to the length of it. Who'll catch the Beetle? “I,” says Peter Spring, “I'll seize it by the wing, “I'll catch the Beetle!” Who'll get a piece of thread? “I,” says Dicky Bluff, “I'll do it quick enough, “I'll tie it round his leg.” Who'll run and hold the string? “We'll all take turns to run, ‘And have some royal fun, “We'll all hold the string.” Who loves to hear him buzz? “We do,” says Lu' and Dick, “We like this funny trick, “We love to hear him buzz!” But who is coming along? A Giant large and strong, Ah, Peter, Dick and Lu'. He's looking right at you! Now towards you all he springs; And ties your legs with strings; He ties them one by one, And tells you all to run— He cries, “Run, run, Dick, Lucy and Peter, “And, remember, just so you serv'd the Fig-eater!” SUMMER. Now the pleasant Spring is past, Here is Summer's scorching blast; The linnet and the magpie sigh, The verdant trees and flowerets die. Ah! 'tis a long and dreary year To wait, before sweet Spring is here; Oh, then, the birds will softly sing, Sweet Spring is here again, dear Spring! ANNA NIVEN. Mother,” Anna Niven cries, Can Marion come and play? “No, no, my dear,” her ma' replies, She must her lessons say.” ANNA. Then do let Fanny come and string Some corals for my doll, While I sit in the airy swing, And play with pretty poll. MOTHER. Anna, my child, why thus persist? You must have heard me say, That she has promised to assist To make your frock to-day. ANNA. But Susan nothing has to do, Except to sweep the stairs; Mamma, do let her come, will you, And help me gather pears? MOTHER. Susan must watch your little brother Their nurse is sick to-day, And sure am I, my dear, no other Can leave her work to play. ANNA. Then, mother dear, suppose that I, Do go and bring my book, And little bench, and sit and read And on the pictures look. MOTHER. That's the way my child should talk— Go, bring your book to me, And when you've read we'll take a walk, On the beach beside the sea. NEW YEAR'S DAY. Wake and see the morning ray— This is happy new year's day! View your toys and presents gay, This is happy new year's day! Brother, sister, come and play, This is happy new year's day! Father, mother, hear me say, A happy, happy, new year's day! Waiting maids and nurses grey, To you a happy new year's day! Friends at home, and friends away, May you enjoy your new year's day! And while I laugh, and skip, and play, I'll thank God for the new year's day. THE SLEEPING BABY. Hush, hush, with your noise, What a talking you keep, You rude little boys, Now the baby's asleep! Hushaby, baby. Mamma has just told me To stay quiet here, And, oh, she will scold me, If wakes baby dear. Hushaby, baby. How soft its white arm, As it lies on its breast! Little baby, no harm Shall come here while you rest. Hushaby, baby. My task has been given, And I will be true, And sister and Heaven Will watch over you. Hushaby, baby. FATHER TAKES ME UP. I love my mother's gentle kiss, I love to join my brother's play, I love to walk with little sis, And view the shops and pictures gay. I love my toys and books to see, I love god-mother's silver cup, But the best thing of things to me, Is when my my father takes me up. Father, when I'm as tall as you, And you are small like little sis, I'll lay you on my shoulder too, And let you feel how nice it is. HENRY IN A PASSION. Master Henry is angry As angry can be; Oh, what is the matter? Let us go and see. His lips they stick out Like the nose of a pump, And he's giving his brother A very hard thump. He is trotting his small foot As fast as a mill; Master Henry, dear Henry, I beg you'd be still. What! throw down the chairs, And kick over the books? Oh Henry, dear Henry, Don't give me such looks! You tell me you will, And then give me a slap! Oh fie, master Henry, Get out of my lap. I know some young readers Will not treat me so; Will you, masters and misses? “Oh no, indeed, no.” THE BOAT. Oh, see my little boat, How prettily it glides; Like a bird it seems to float, Press'd forward by the tides— By the tides. The sky is shining brightly, The fishes dart below, While my little boat so lightly Leaps onward as I row— As I row. I would like to be a boat, And live upon the sea; So merrily I'd float, With nought to trouble me— Trouble me. But should a storm come near, And fill me with alarms, I would row to mother dear— My boat should be her arms— Mother's arms. TO THE ANT. Two little girls carried a piece of sugar for some months, every day, from the breakfast table, to a family of ants, and one of them said thus: Come here, little ant, For the pretty bird can't. I want you to come, And live at my home; I know you will stay, And help me to play. Stop making that hill, Little ant, and be still. Come, creep to my feet, Here is sugar to eat. Say, are you not weary, My poor little deary, With bearing that load, Across the wide road? Leave your hill now, to me, And then you shall see, That by filling my hand, I can pile up the sand, And save you the pains Of bringing these grains. THE ANT'S ANSWER. Stop, stop, little miss, No such building as this Will answer for me, As you plainly can see. I take very great pains, And place all the grains As if with a tool, By a carpenter's rule. You have thrown the coarse sand All out of your hand, And so fill'd up my door, That I can't find it more. My King and my Queen Are chok'd up within; My little ones too, Oh what shall I do? You have smother'd them all, With the sand you let fall. I must borrow or beg, Or look for an egg, When an ant's nest is disturbed, there may be seen processions of ants bearing little white eggs, for more than a day. Ants are divided into workers, sentinels, &amp;c., like bees, and they have their King and Queen also. To keep under my eye, For help by and by, A new house I must raise, In a very few days, Nor stand here and pine, Because you've spoilt mine. For when winter days come, I shall mourn for my home; So stand out of my way, I have no time to play. POOR WILLY. Poor Willy in play, I am sorry to say, His head did hit; To his mother he ran, Like a little man, Not minding it. Then she rubb'd it well, And a story did tell, And kiss'd him too; Then back did he run, To his little fun, And so must you. WHO IS THIS BOY? I will write a little story, About a little boy; He is his father's comfort, He is his mother's joy. When we give a little errand, He thinks of what is said, Pulls down his little waistcoat, And holds up his little head. He holds his little fork By the handle, as he should, And never spills his coffee, Nor drops about his food. His face is very pleasant, What he says is always true; Now tell me, youngest reader, If this little boy is you. NANCY RAY. My bird is dead, Said Nancy Ray, My bird is dead, I cannot play. He sang so sweetly Every day— He sings no more, I cannot play. Go put his cage Far, far away, I do not love His cage to-day She wiped her eyes, Poor Nancy Ray, And sat and sighed, But could not play. THE KITE. Oh look at my kite, In its airy flight; How pretty it flies, Right up to the skies, With its white breast stirr'd, Just like a bird! Pretty kite, pretty kite, In your airy flight, What do you spy, In the bright blue sky? I wish I was you, To be there too, Oh, then, how soon I would peep at the moon, And see the man there, Who gives me a stare, When I look up at night, At his beautiful light! THE BIRD'S NEST. On a bright and pleasant day, John and James went out to play: As they stopp'd a while to rest, On a tree they spied a nest, Pretty eggs were lying there, Pretty eggs all placed with care. “Come,” says Johnny, with a laugh, “You and I will each take half. And the rest we'll give to Ann.” So towards the tree they ran. Just then, upon a branch they heard The fluttering of the mother-bird, And a note that seem'd to say, “Will you take my eggs away, When I've made my nest with care, And put them all so nicely there? Oh! do not, pray, my nest destroy, Have pity on me, little boy. When you in the cradle lay, No one took you far away, Safe you were, and smil'd and smil'd, A little bright and happy child. And your mother lov'd you so, Better than you e'er can know. Then do not take my nest away, Little boy, I beg and pray.” John and James said not a word, And their little hearts were stirr'd; They wip'd their eyes and went to play, And felt quite happy all that day. THE LITTLE COLT. For a Little Boy to Recite. Pray how shall I, a little lad, In speaking make a figure? You are but jesting, I'm afraid, Do wait till I am bigger. But since you wish to hear my part, And urge me to begin it, I'll strive for praise with all my art, Though small my chance to win it. I'll tell a tale how farmer John A little roan colt bred, sir, And every night and every morn, He watered and he fed, sir. Said neighbour Jo, to farmer John, You surely are a dolt, sir, To spend such daily care upon A little useless colt, sir. The farmer answered wondering Jo, “I bring my little roan up, Not for the good he now can do, But may do when he's grown up.” The moral you may plainly see, To keep the tale from spoiling; The little colt you think is me,— I know it by your smiling. I now entreat you to excuse My lisping and my stammers, And, since you've learnt my Parents' views, I'll humbly make my manners. HYMN FOR A CHILD. The glorious God who reigns on high, Who formed the earth and built the sky, Stoops from his throne in Heaven to hear A little infant's prattling prayer. Father of all! My Father too! Oh make me good, and just, and true, Make me delight to learn thy word, And love to pray and praise thee, Lord, Oh may thy gracious presence bless And guard my childhood's helplessness; Be with me, as I grow in years, And guide me through this vale of tears. GOOD NIGHT. Good night, mamma; good night, papa; I'm going now to sleep; Your little boy will say his prayers, And God his soul will keep. A LITTLE BOY'S THOUGHTS. A little boy, five years of age, said the following words. He had never seen the ocean, and had never lost a friend. His mother was astonished at his language, and wrote exactly as he spoke. Oh, God, pray thee let me go to heaven! I will be a good boy. To the skies, to the skies I must go; If I be a bad boy, I cannot go to heaven, When I go to heaven, I'll be an angel, And with the wings I'll fly where I please. Oh, God, I wish I would be a good boy! What do you see coming? A boat—a boat—a boat, my friend! Coming up? No—going down. But, ah, I was mistaken! Now it does not come to land, And now I have no joy. When I came from o'er the sea I was so very glad, But now I am so very sorry, Because my friend is dead: When did I come from the sandy sea? In summer, when the flowers were springing up. WHO MADE THE FLOWER? A little child, who loves to see The bright sun shining clear, Is often asking, “Where is He Who placed the bright sun here?” She sees the moonlight's silver gleam, And stars with twinkling ray, And says, “Who made that gentle beam, Almost more fair than day?” She gathers for her mother dear A blossom rich and fair, And asks, “Who placed these colours here, And mixed them with such care?” 'Tis God, my child, who will impart More glorious objects still, A temper mild, a feeling heart, And strength to do His will. ASKING ABOUT SORROW. Mother, how sad is Emma Gray, How mournfully she sighs! She will not laugh, or talk, or play, And tears are in her eyes. “I know that God is very great, And it is strange to me, That on his royal throne of state, He should not Emma see. “And mother, if our God is good, How can he let her cry? I wish all this I understood— Say, will you tell me why?” Daughter, come let us take a walk, Where yesterday we went; And have a little quiet talk, To soothe your discontent. How bright, my love, the garden glows, How balmy is the air, And look upon your favourite rose, The blossoms cluster fair! Do you remember how each leaf Seem'd withering yesternoon, And you were full of childish grief That it must die so soon! And when at night the wind and rain Come bursting from the sky, You for your flow'ret mourned again, And thought that it must die? Perhaps our tears are sent like showers, But to refresh the heart, And sighs like winds in summer hours, Will make new virtues start. “Oh, yes, mamma! I see it now— You think that Emma's tears Will make her good, and clear her brow For many sunny years.” FANNY. There's not a little girl I meet, Not even Sue or Annie, That seems to me more fair and sweet Than my young neighbour, Fanny. 'Tis not because her eyes are black, And look so bright and funny; 'Tis not because her breath is pure, As new mown hay or honey. 'Tis not because at dancing school Her step is light and airy, Or that she skips about the house Just like a little fairy. 'Tis not because in Carpenter She learns a “monstrous” column, Nor that she sits in company Sometimes quite still and solemn. Nor is it that her little hands She waves about so gaily, When telling every artless thought That fills her bosom daily. It is because good-nature comes To light each limb and feature, That Fanny always seems to me A charming little creature. THE LITTLE BOY PLEADS FOR MOUSE. LITTLE BOY. Oh, ma', speak to pussy and kitty, They are dragging all over the house, Without any mercy or pity, A poor little innocent mouse. I hate to see such wicked cunning, For pussy allows it to go, And just as the mouse thinks of running She catches and teases it so. MOTHER. My son, our old puss cannot reason, And therefore she is not a sinner; Perhaps this is not hungry season, And this teasing is cooking her dinner. But when children, my darling, are cruel, And injure the brutes heaven made, They sully the beautiful jewel, That with a kind heart is inlaid. “JESUS WEPT.” Mamma, you say I must not cry— Why do you tell me so? If Jesus wept, why may not I? He could not sin, you know.” “He wept, my dear, for human sin— Not at a trifling wound, You almost cry to lose a pin— Or at the thunder's sound. “You oft have wept for foolish things, And have from anger cried, He mourned a sister's sufferings, And wept when Laz'rus died. “He wept the tears the Scriptures bless— Tears for another's woe; Such sorrow I would ne'er repress, Nor chide its overflow. “Be good—and banish idle fears, Nor even fear to die, For God himself will wipe such tears From every human eye.” THE INFANT'S GRAVE. Come, mother, will you go and see Where little brother lies? “I cannot, love, for if I should, The tears would dim my eyes. “Not yet, not yet—I cannot gaze Upon that chilly clod! Better it is for me to think That he is with his God. “A few short months, and grass will grow Over his little grave, And then perhaps the church-yard flower Will spring and gently wave. “Then will we go, and I will see Where my sweet baby lies; For God will soothe my breaking heart, And dry my weeping eyes.” “AND JESUS TOOK LITTLE CHILDREN IN HIS ARMS.” I will go to Jesus now, His arms are open still for youth, He will hear my early vow, He will lead my heart to truth. When I wake with morning light, I will seek his blessed voice, And when fall the shades of night, He shall be my happy choice. He will teach me how to pray, He will teach me what to do; How to pass a holy day, How to keep my God in view. When my heart is faint and weak, And some foolish fear alarms, I my Saviour's word will seek, He will hold me in his arms. When a sinful thought comes by, Or angry passions move my breast, I will bid the tempter fly; In His arms again I'll rest. Then happy will the moment prove, When God shall call me up to Heaven, When Jesus folds me in his love, And faults repented are forgiven. TO A BUTTERFLY AT CHURCH. Butterfly, butterfly, why come here, This is no bower for you! Go sip the honey-drop sweet and clear, Or bathe in the morning dew. This is the place to think of Heaven This is the place to pray; You have no sins to be forgiven,— Butterfly, go away. I see God has touch'd you with beautiful dyes, And your motion is graceful and light, But the heart is the thing open now to His eyes; The heart must be pure in his sight. He has made us to love what is airy and gay, And I will not despise your bright wings; But I must not be thinking about you to-day,— It was given for holier things. THE BOY IS COLD. I think I might get near the grate, My toes they grow colder and colder; I am sure I wish, early and late, That I could be bigger and older. There's grandma' stowed close by the fire, And she's managed to squeeze in my brother; Aunt Polly has got her desire, And sits like a toast next to mother. My teeth they all shake in my head, And my hands are like skim'd milk so blue; And my feet feel as if they were dead, And I'm sure I can't tell what to do. I have tried once or twice to go near, And they cry out “Oh don't be a baby, Run about and you'll warm yourself, dear;” They think I've no feeling then, may be. I just wish that from now till to-morrow They and I could change fingers and toes, And then they'd find out to their sorrow, How a fellow must feel when he's froze. THE BOY'S COMPLAINT ABOUT BUTTER. Oh, mother won't you speak to Kate? I have not had enough to eat: And when she spreads a little bread, She thinks she gives me such a treat. I only wish I was a man, To have my butter an inch thick, And not be talking all the time, How this and that will make me sick. Poor little boys are sadly used, They cannot have the thing they wish; While grown up people help themselves To what they like from every dish. As soon as I become a man, I'll have a pie as tall as you, With door and windows like a house, And lin'd with plums all through and through. And I'll go in whene'er I choose, And sit as snug as Jacky Horner; And even Katey, though she's cross, Shall sometimes come and eat a corner. My windows all with jelly made, Like Boston glass shall glisten bright, And sugar candy for the frames, At every turn shall meet my sight. My floors shall be of ginger-bread, Because that's pretty hard, you know, Sanded all o'er with sugar plums, Rolling about where'er I go. And mother, Kate, my cellaret Shall be all butter, shap'd with ice, And then we'll see if I must fret Because I want a little slice. And mother—Oh she's gone away! And Katey—What—you've left me too? I won't stand talking to the walls, But go and find some work to do. REMONSTRANCE ABOUT THE DRUMSTICK. It seems very strange, and I can't make it out, Why the drumstick is given to me; I think I deserve a nice part of the fowl, Yet forever the drumstick I see. I pass the white meat to Miss Anderson's plate, And old Mr. Rich takes the thighs; The side-bones go off at a terrible rate, And the pinion to sister Ann flies. If I were to count all the drumsticks I've had Since the pap spoon was taken away, And I've sitten at table with women and men, You would hardly believe what I say. 'Tis said that a part helps a part, and I'm sure, If that is the state of the case, I think I can enter before very long With “Bonnets of Blue” for a race. I'm sure I'm not greedy, but really, papa, If you give me the drumstick again, Your son, in the place of a leg like your own, Will exhibit the shank of a crane. THE NEW BOOTS. Come, mother, and look at these beautiful boots, Just hear what an elegant creak! I declare there's no word so sweet in the world, As that which a new boot can speak. Take care, sister Anna, don't come in my way, Run further, you troublesome chit,— You would look at my boots? Oh very well, dear, Come and see how completely they fit. Why, really the child has a share of good taste Just see her admiring gaze! Come, come, sister Nanny, and sit in my lap. Little children have such pretty ways. Pray mamma, don't look anxiously down at my toes, I assure you they don't hurt at all; They only look tight, as is often the case, I would not have bought them too small. Young Loring and I chose our boots at one store,— His foot is the size of my own; But really, mamma, he bought his so large, That he looks like a clown overgrown. Hark! Toney is coming,—now don't say a word, Just see how his white eyes will shine. Hear, Toney, my boy, what an elegant creak Proceeds from these new boots of mine! Did you ever behold a fit more complete? Why turn your big eyes to the wall? “He new, and he bright, Massa Johnny, for true, And pride neber feel pain at all.” THE TIGHT BOOTS. Oh, mamma, I am mortified, hurt and asham'd, And scarce can look up in your face: Young Loring, who never could beat me before, Has beat me to-day in a race. You laugh! I would thank you ma' never to laugh As you do when I speak in this style; I think I would sometimes prefer to be whipped, Than to see that half-comical smile. Well, mamma, we were walking just out of the town, When Loring proposed we should run; You know what a fellow I am for a race, And I thought to have excellent fun. So we started together, the boys looking on, My boots felt as tight as a vice; I hobbled and stumbled, just ready to fall, While Loring was off in a trice. The boys shouted, “New boots, run, new boots, hurra!” Their ridicule went to my soul; I hopped like a turkey, and was not half way, When Loring was safe at the goal. My toes were all cramp'd, and my ankles were sore, And I made such a shocking grimace, That Loring, though he's such a gentleman, ma', Could not help laughing out in my face. And big Billy Blackford took out his hair comb, And said, as he sat on the grass, “Though your boots spoil your racing, they'll serve a good turn, And answer right well for a glass.” Pray hand me my old boots, dear ma', if you please; And Toney, do stretch these a bit. No grinning, you rogue, they are scarcely too small; Just stretch them—I know they will fit. THE BOY IN TROUBLE ABOUT HIS OLD HAT. Now look at this hat! is it fit to be seen, All batter'd and tattered and torn? I can't go to King-street to get an ice-cream— I declare it is not to be borne. Nay, mother, you need not be shaking your head, And looking as much as to say, That you think I am careless, and all about that, In your solemn, but good-natur'd way. I am sure that American hats are not strong, Or they would never wear out so fast,— And here I must worry till Christmas, you say— I don't think this old thing will last. To be sure I have kick'd it about for a ball, And stuff'd it with ginger cake too; And once I let it drop into Bennett's mill pond While paddling in William's canoe. And once, I remember, I felt very dry, And just fill'd it up at the pump; And once I was hunting with Dinah for eggs. And gave it a terrible thump. I confess the two kittens did make it their bed, But then they were white as the snow, And puss laid them carefully into the hat, So I could not refuse her, you know. This dent on the top was an accident, ma,' And that cut on the edge was another; And this stain with the physic you gave me one day, And that hole, I got playing with brother. Master Robert call'd yesterday, dress'd quite in style, And ask'd me to go out to ride, But I had to say, no, for a terrible sight My old hat would have been by his side. And Miss Emma came also, that sweet little girl, And I wanted to see her home so, With her little straw bonnet all trimm'd up with blue, But how shabby I look'd for a beau. Oh, dear! I must wait as I have done before, Since dollars appear very few, But I tell you when once I get rid of this hat, I mean to take care of the new. NOT READY FOR SCHOOL. Pray, where is my hat—it is taken away, And my shoe-strings are all in a knot! I can't find a thing where it should be to-day, Though I've hunted in every spot. My slate and my pencil no where can be found, Though I placed them as safe as can be; While my books and my maps are all scattered around, And hop about just like a flea. Do, Rachel, just look for my Atlas up stairs, My Æsop is somewhere there too And sister, just brush down these troublesome hairs, And mother, just fasten my shoe. And sister, beg father to write an excuse, But stop, he will only say “No;” And go on with a smile, and keep reading the news, While every thing bothers me so. My satchel is heavy, and ready to fall, This old pop-gun is breaking my map; I'll have nothing to do with the pop-gun or ball, There's no playing for such a poor chap. The town clock will strike in a minute, I fear, Then away to the foot I must sink; There—look at my Carpenter tumbled down here, And my Worcester covered with ink. I wish I'd not lingered at breakfast the last, Though the toast and the butter were fine; I think that our Edward must eat pretty fast, To be off when I haven't done mine. Now Edward and Harry protest they won't wait, And beat on the door with their sticks; I suppose they will say I was dressing too late; To-morrow, I'll be up at six. ATTEMPT TO WRITE POETRY. My paper is ruled very neat, Father 's made me an elegant pen; I sit quite upright on my seat, And have every thing ready; what then? I have scratched my head several times, And nothing comes out of it yet; For my life I can't make out the rhymes; Not a word can I think of but—fret. Dear mother, do help me a bit, I'm puzzled—no matter—here goes— But how the right measure to hit,— I have a good subject—I know-s. There once was a widow in trouble, She was aged, and old, and advanced; Not a word can I think of but bubble, And it won't do to say that she danced. A widow she was of great feeling, Of great feeling this widow was she; 'Twill be shocking to speak of her squealing, And how can I lug in a flea? This widow to woe was a votary, Oh, mother! you laugh at her woes, And say I had better quit poetry, Until I know how to write prose. WISHES. ANNA. I wish I was a small bird, Among the leaves to dwell, To scale the sky in gladness Or seek the lonely dell. My matin song should wake amid The chorus of the earth, And my vesper hymn ring gladly The trill of careless mirth. ELLEN. I wish I was a floweret To blossom in the grove, I'd spread my opening leaflets Among the plants I love. No hand would roughly cull me As I looked up to the sky, I silently should ope to life, And quietly should die. MARY. I wish I was a gold-fish To seek the sunny wave, To part the gentle ripple, And amid its coolness lave. I would glide alone delighted Amid the coral way, And when night came on in softness Beneath the star-beam play. MOTHER. Hush, hush, romantic prattlers, You know not what you say, When soul, the crown of mortals. You would lightly throw away. What is the songster's warble, Or the floweret's blush refin'd To the noble thought of Deity Within your opening mind? THE BOY IS IN TOO GREAT A HURRY TO BUY A HAT. Now, mother, don't laugh, because I 've returned Without a new hat on my head; I am sure I am weary as weary can be, And puzzled enough, as you said. In the first place, I went to those big-looking stores, Where the hats all so splendidly shine; But the caps looked so stylish I could not decide, If a hat or a cap should be mine. An elegant blue cap delighted me first, Which I felt quite determined to buy; But just as I found that it fitted my head, A brown one attracted my eye. I put on the brown, and it set like a T, So I took out the money to pay; When Johnny came in, I said, “Don't be in haste, You have not been to Smith's store to-day.” I looked at the pretty brown cap as he spoke. John urged, though I wanted to linger; “Why the fashion at Smith's is as handsome again,” And he snapt at my brown with his finger. So, mother, I thought I would look at his choice, For 'tis right to look out for the best; And an elegant sight I confess was displayed, There were black, brown, and blue, and the rest. I first tried on one, and then tried another, One was large, and the other too small; The clock then struck three, and I had to come home Without bringing any at all. I know I was stubborn, and said I would go, But I've tried it enough to my sorrow; So I hope you'll forgive me, this time, mother dear, And I'll take what you choose me to-morrow. A LITTLE GIRL IS SHUT UP FOR TALKING PERTLY. Mamma, I've lost my thimble, And my spool has roll'd away; My arms are aching dreadfully, And I want to go and play. I 've spent the livelong morning, Picking out this endless seam, So many pieces in a shirt, Is quite a foolish scheme. If I could set the fashion, I know what I would do; I 'd not be troubling people, And make them sit and sew. I 'd put some homespun on their necks, And sew it all around; And make them look like cotton bags, Placed endwise on the ground. I hate to make these button holes, I do not love to stitch; My threads keep breaking all the time, With just a little twitch. There 's Johnny playing marbles, And Susan skipping rope, They have finished all their easy tasks, While I must sit and mope. I think, mamma, 't is very hard, That you should keep me here, When the blue sky looks so temptingly, And the sun is shining clear. Mamma! She's gone and left me, And closely shut the door; Mamma! mamma! come back again, I will not grumble more. Oh, dear! how foolish I have been— From dinner I must stay; Mamma, mamma, come back again, Forgive your child, I pray. Alas, she 's reached the balcony, And means not to return; Oh, what a look she cast on me, So sad and yet so stern. CALL TO SABBATH SCHOOL. Wake, sister, wake, 'tis a holy day, We must not linger here; The birds are up, and have soared away, And are singing their anthems clear. Young flowers have open'd their lovely eyes, And their rich perfume have given; And they fix their looks on the distant skies, As if they knew something of Heaven. We will go to the house of praise and prayer, The altar of youthful love; And Jesus in spirit will meet us there, And bear our off'ring above. Then wake, sister, wake, 'tis a happy day; Perchance from his blessed throng, Some youthful seraph has winged his way, To join in our Sabbath song. THE MULTIPLICATION TABLE IN RHYME. PART FIRST.

MORNING HYMN. This is earth's waking hour, And beautiful to see; The sun beams out with glorious power, And kindling majesty. Oh, what have I to do With slothful visions now? Let me my early prayers renew With bright and happy brow. For God has blessed my night, And nerved my youthful frame, And I will seek him with delight Through Jesus' blessed name.</field>

Come, school-mates gather round me, For time with gentle wing, Is floating o'er our pastime, As we merrily, merrily sing, Holiday! CHORUS. Then join the happy chorus, And let our motto be, To work with all our hearts at school, And frolic when we're free! Holiday! DUET. Releas'd awhile from duty, Our minds are resting now, Though boasting still the fruitage We've cull'd from learning's bough. Holiday! CHORUS. Then join the happy chorus, And let our motto be, To work with all our hearts at school, And frolic when we're free! Holiday! DUET. We gladly take the flowers That Leisure's hands have brought, Though we shunn'd her idle bowers, When study claim'd our thought. Holiday! CHORUS. Then join the happy chorus, And let our motto be, To work with all our hearts at school, And frolic when we're free! Holiday! DUET. What youth shall wear the laurel, When our joyful song is done? He who with patient labour His tutor's smile has won. Holiday! CHORUS. Then join the happy chorus, And let our motto be, To work with all our hearts at school, And frolic when we're free! Holiday!

Then join the happy chorus, And let our motto be, To work with all our hearts at school, And frolic when we're free? Holiday! WILL BANTER AND JOHN HOWARD. WILL. Come, now, let us kick up a dust, Our master has gone out of school; Tom Tricky I know will be first, To break every tyrannous rule. Ben Dodd is beginning to swear, And rips out his oaths in a breath, But little for God does he care, Though his friends are half worried to death. John Howard, come out of that corner, And join in our frolic, I say, How can you be acting Jack Horner, And fumbling your Virgil all day? JOHN. Excuse me, friend Will, and be quiet, We have quite time enough for our fun, Without getting into a riot, And leaving our studies undone. Not manly to me is an oath, A jest that is gross I despise, And when I am tempted by both, Superior to both will I rise. I will not join the reckless and rude, Independent and firm I remain; I have often your laughter withstood, And I've courage to bear it again. FLIGHT OF THE MUSKOGEE INDIAN. On the shore of Carolina an Indian warrior stood, A captive of the Shawnees, and reddened with their blood; Strange arts of varied torture his conquerors tried in vain; Like a rock that stands the billows, he dashed them off again. He shouted, and the echo shrill returned the lengthened shriek, “I have rent you as the eagle rends the dove within his beak; And ye give me women's tortures; see, I lightly cast them by, As the Spirit of the storm-cloud throws the vapour from the sky.” “Ye are women!” the wild echo came wilder on the air— “I will show a worthy trial for a Muskogee to bear; Let me grasp a heated gun in this raw and bloody hand, And ye shall not see an eyelash move to shame my father-land.” They gave the glowing steel. He took it with a smile, And held it as a plaything;—they stood in awe the while; Then, springing like an antelope, he brandished it around, And toward the beetling eminence A bluff near Augusta, ninety feet high. upstarted with a bound. One leap, and he is over! fierce, dashing through the stream, And his massy form lies floating 'neath the clear and sunny beam; A hundred arrows sped at once, but missed that warrior bold, And his mangled arms, ere set of sun, his little ones enfold. THE VERMONT CHILDREN. Three fleeting years have come and gone Since Ann Pomroy I met, Returning from the district school, Ere yet the sun was set. With her, her brother Francis stray'd, And, both in merry tone, Were saying all the rambling things Youth loves when tasks are done. The mountain tinge was on their cheeks; From far Vermont they came, For wandering habits led their sire A Southern home to claim. Fresh with the airy spring of youth They tripp'd the woods along; Now darting off to cull a flower, Now bursting into song. Oh, Ann Pomroy, thy sparkling eye Methinks I often see, When some young face in loveliness, Beams up in smiles to me. And when light rounds of boyish mirth Laugh out uncheck'd by fear, It seems to me that Francis' voice Is floating on my ear. I said the hue of health they bore,— Hers was the nect'rine fair, And his the deep pomegranate tinge, That boys of beauty wear. They walk'd at early morn and eve, And as I yearly paid My visit to the Planter's Hall, I saw the youth and maid. At first, by simple accident, I came upon their walk; But soon I loved to pause and seek The privilege of talk— Until my steps were daily turn'd, But how I scarce can say, When Ann and Francis came from home, To meet them on the way. They told me of New England hills, Of orchards in the sun, Of sleigh-rides with the merry bells, Of skating's stirring fun; And sometimes of a grave they spake, And then would sadder grow, In which a gentle mother slept Beneath the wintry snow. When April's changing face was seen, Again from town I flew, To where the sleep of nature wakes To sights and odours new. All things were fair,—the plants of earth Look'd upward to the sky, And the blue heaven o'er-arched them still With clear and glittering eye. I sought the walk I used to seek, And took the little store Of toys, that from the city's mart, For Ann and Frank I bore. A rustling in the leaves I heard, But Francis only came; His eye was dim, his cheek was pale, And agues shook his frame. He saw me, to my open arms With sudden gladness sprang; Then raised a thrilling cry of grief, With which the forest rang. Few words he spake, but led me on To where a grave-like mound, With young spring plants and evergreens, In rural taste were crown'd. And there he stood, while gushing tears Like summer rain-drops came, And heavings, as a troubled sea, Went o'er his blighted frame. I did not ask him who was there; I felt that Ann was gone; Around his drooping neck I hung, And stood like him forlorn. “I soon shall die,” the mourner said; “Here will they make my grave, And over me the Cedar trees And moaning Pines will wave. “None then will come to tend the flowers That blossom o'er her bed; None sing for her the twilight dirge, When I am with the dead. “I can not join the school-boy sports; My head and heart are sad; When Ann is in her silent grave, Oh, how can I be glad? “And when I say my studied tasks, Or gain the once-loved prize, I weep, and softly pray to Heaven To lay me where she lies.” I kiss'd his pale and suffering brow, By early sorrows riven; I talk'd to him of her he lov'd, And rais'd his thoughts to Heaven. And when the call of duty came, To take me from his side, He told me, with a sickly smile, “'Twas best that Ann had died.” Another annual season roll'd Its cares and joys along— Again I sought the country's charms, Deep woods and caroll'd song. And there I found two silent graves Amid the vernal bloom— I ne'er shall see those forms again, Till Heaven unseals the tomb. Oh, Southern summer, false and fair, Why, on thy loaded wing, Blent with rich flowers and fruitage rare, The seeds of sorrow bring? A FABLE. FOR A YOUNG FRIEND. In a beautiful garden, my dear little maid, A grape-vine had twined itself into an arbour, And under its branches in beauty array'd, A small but sweet rose-bush delighted to harbour. The blush on its bosom was brilliant and light, As that which on modesty's cheek oft reposes, And it beam'd with a freshness as fair to the sight, As youth in its innocent beauty discloses. Those thought, who had seen it, its grace and its bloom, Resembled the charms of a sweet little child; And while giving delight by its grateful perfume, Compar'd it to her who was pleasant and mild. One beautiful morning while nature was gay, And the sun in his elegant splendour was seen, The grape-vine appeared in her fairest array Of dew-drops, that hung on her mantle of green. She rais'd up her head and look'd down to the shade Where the sweet little rose-bush was blooming below, And then in rough accents contemptuously said, With words that were chilling as pride could bestow: “You have dress'd yourself out in a beautiful style, To attract all the gazers that come to your view; And perhaps you expect by your graces the while, To become for a time even my rival too. “You poor short-liv'd creature, and do you not know, That I am the shade which prevents you from dying? That exposed to the sun you no longer could grow, And around your fine head all your leaves would be flying? “Put off your pretensions, you look like a fright, And don't try to blush and to smile as you do— You think by this folly to give some delight, But when I am present pray who would see you?” The rose really blush'd the deep scarlet of pride, To see one so much older so cross and ill bred, And she hid her sweet face on a shrub by her side, Which press'd to support her soft innocent head. But sudden the skies darken'd into deep gloom, While the lightning's red gleam was tremendous and wild; The high grape-vine trembled in fear of her doom— But the innocent rose-bush look'd upward and smil'd. And now the wild winds whistled hoarsely around, And deep peals of thunder came bursting between; The rude tempest fell'd the fair vine to the ground, And the arbour laid low, with its ringlets of green. The loud storm had ceas'd, and the sun's brilliant ray, Shone gaily on nature and open'd each sweet, When Mary, young, innocent, modest and gay, Stole into her garden, her fav'rite retreat. She paus'd as she saw the high vine laid so low, And the lesson she learn'd found its way to her heart, And she pray'd, that her God would his favour bestow, And bid from her mind evil passions depart. She pray'd, as the rose, to be modest and meek, Nor boast, like the grape-vine, of beauty and grace: For pride spoils the bloom of a beautiful cheek, And a heart that is pur is more fair than a face. THE MOTHER'S ANGER; OR THE DISSIPATED BOY. Tis the first time—the only time That e'er she turn'd away, And left me with the brand of crime To curse this fatal day! For sixteen years her evening kiss, Has dwelt upon my brow, Or lip, or cheek, in gentle bliss,— Alas! where is it now? Would that I were again the child, Who lay upon her breast, And looked into her eyes and smiled, Caressing and carest! Would that I now could bend my head Upon her knee in prayer, And hear the holy words she said When once I nestled there! Oh, had I dashed the cup away That lured me to my shame! I cannot weep—I cannot pray— My heart—my thoughts are flame! Mother, dear mother, turn once more And bless thy sorrowing son! Look on me as thou didst before Ere sin's dark work was done. Oh heaven! she comes—I feel her breath Cool, on my feverish eyes! She speaks—the burning torch of death At her soft accent flies! Oh, mother, on my knees I swear To spurn the tempting bowl, Nor risk again where revellers are, Thy love—my God—my soul! LUCY LEE. I wandered forth, at closing day, To breathe the evening air; Not yet was dropp'd the curtain gray, Which hides the flowerets fair. They blush'd in beauty 'neath my tread, And all their rich perfume Around in generous fragrance shed, Unwitting of their doom. I could not choose but bid my eye, In simple gladness, rest Upon the gorgeous drapery, That lin'd the lovely west. And fain was I to hear the note The blackbird gaily sung, As on the air it seem'd to float, And o'er my heart-strings rung. I reach'd the brook and mossy stone, Where lingering still for me, Was wont to sit, till twilight lone, My little Lucy Lee. Her knitting in her merry way, Would Lucy hold on high, And all the progress of the day, Upon the fingers try. She was not there—not richly now To me the sunset beam'd; The blackbird carol'd on the bough, But not for me it seem'd. More bright than these was Lucy's look, When yesterday it shone, More sweet her voice, when o'er the brook, She sent its joyous tone. I hasten'd onward to the cot, Where Lucy's mother dwelt,— Why seem'd it such a lonely spot! I never thus had felt. The woodbine now as gracefully, Around the porch was hung, The little gate with motion free As hospitably swung. I paused a moment—and a groan Fell deeply on my ear; I enter'd, it was Lucy's moan, She knew not I was near. She knelt beside her mother's bed, Her head was resting there; The mother's struggling breath had fled, Her daughter knelt in prayer. And tears came gushing on her cheek, And sobs convuls'd her frame, I heard the little sufferer speak, It was her mother's name. Come to my arms, poor child, I cried, Come hither, Lucy Lee, God has been lavish to my pride, I'll share his gifts with thee. She lean'd her pale cheek on my breast I press'd her to my heart, And from that sacred place of rest, No more shall she depart. THE FLOWER, THE SUN, THE AIR, AND THE DEW. My father is the sun, That shineth down on me, And I grow beneath his sight, Like a floweret pure and free. My mother is the air, That softly fans my leaf, And dries the pearly drop, That falls in youthful grief. My sisters are the dew, And, resting on my breast, Cheer me when I awake, Refresh me when I rest. But one is greater still, Than sun, or air, or dew; The God who gives them all, And made the floweret too. THE DUMB LUNATIC. Mark ix. 17. From amid the crowd what unhallowed tone— What voice in misery cried? It seemed like nature's lamenting moan, For reason's blessings denied. Oh, behold that face with its pallid hue, Like snow-flakes at twilight's chime; And that eye so burning, yet rayless too, Like the moon in her waning time. And the youthful form that with early pain, Has withered in boyhood's glow: And the tongue with motion so quick and vain, And the restless look of wo. In anguish beside him his father stands In a statelier mood of grief; He is grasping closely those thin white hands, And eagerly asks relief. The Disciples of Jesus cannot bless; He turns in anguish away, And a smile of dark, unbelieving distress Seems o'er his closed lips to stray. But, behold! the Saviour of men appears! A thrill to his chilled heart flies; His faith contends with decaying fears, And the warm drops fill his eyes. A few soothing words to a father's wo, Are breathed by that voice of power; Sweet as the flush of a fountain's flow, In the blaze of a noontide hour. A higher address of command is heard! Oh, what has that accent done? It has banished “the sickness of hope deferred,” Has restored the maniac son. CHOICE OF HOURS. FATHER. I love to walk at twilight When sunset nobly dies, And see the parting splendour That lightens up the skies, And call up old remembrances Deep, dim as evening gloom, Or look to heaven's promises Like star-light on a tomb. LAURA. I love the hour of darkness When I give myself to sleep, And I think that holy angels Their watch around me keep. My dreams are light and happy As I innocently lie, For my mother's kiss is on my cheek, And my father's step is nigh. MARY. I love the social afternoon, When lessons all are said, Geography is laid aside And grammar put to bed; Then a walk upon the Battery With a friend is very sweet, And some money for an ice-cream To give that friend a treat. MOTHER. I love the Sabbath evening When my lov'd ones sit around, And tell of all their feelings By hope and fancy crowned; And though some plants are missing In that sweetly thoughtful hour, I will not call them back again To earth's decaying bower. CHOICE OF COUNTRIES. FATHER. I would cross the wide Atlantic, And the cliffs of England hail, For there my country's fathers First set their western sail. I would view its domes and palaces, And tread each learned hall, And on the soil where Newton trod My foot should proudly fall. I would gaze upon its landscapes, The dell and sunny glade, And tread with awe the cloister'd aisle Where Addison is laid. LOUISA. I would seek the Indian Ocean, Where the sea-shell loves to grow, Where the tints upon its bosom In gorgeous beauty glow. I would chase the parting billow For treasures new and rare, And with wreaths of blushing coral Entwine my waving hair. CAROLINE. I would be a ship's commander, And find the northern pole, While o'er untravelled oceans My vent'rous bark should roll. Or I'd seek untrodden islands, Amid Antarctic seas, And the standard of my country Plant first before the breeze. ELIZA. Oh, give to me my birth-place, My dear, my native home! From its fair and sheltering borders I ask not e'er to roam. My schoolmates here are playing, My parents dear I see; Oh, give to me my birth-place, It is fair enough for me! ANNA. I do not know where England is, Nor any other place, But I love to frolic with my puss, And see her wash her face. I'll keep close by my baby-house, And be very good all day, If one I love will dress my dolls And let me have my way. MOTHER. The whole broad earth is beautiful, To minds attuned aright, And wheresoe'er my feet have turn'd, A smile has met my sight. The city, with its bustling walk, Its splendour, wealth, and power,— A ramble by the river side,— A passing summer flower; The meadow green, the ocean's swell, The forest waving free, Are gifts of God, and speak in tones Of kindliness to me. And oh, where'er my lot is cast, Where'er my footsteps roam, If those I love are near to me, I feel that spot my home. CHOICE OF OCCUPATIONS. JOHN. I mean to be a soldier, With uniform quite new, I wish they'd let me have a drum, And be a captain too: I would go amid the battle, With my broadsword in my hand, And hear the cannon rattle, And the music all so grand. MOTHER. My son, my son! what if that sword Should strike a noble heart, And bid some loving father From his little ones depart? What comfort would your waving plumes And brilliant dress bestow, When you thought upon his widow's tears, And her orphan's cry of wo? WILLIAM. I mean to be a President, And rule each rising state, And hold my levees once a week, For all the gay and great: I'll be a king, except a crown, For that they wont allow, And I'll find out what the Tariff is, That puzzles me so now. MOTHER. My son, my son! the cares of state Are thorns upon the breast, That ever pierce the good man's heart, And rob him of his rest; The great and gay to him appear As trifling as the dust, For he knows how little they are worth— How faithless is their trust. LOUISA. I mean to be a cottage girl, And sit behind a rill, And morn and eve my pitcher there With purest water fill; And I'll train a lovely woodbine Around my cottage door, And welcome to my winter hearth The wandering and the poor. MOTHER. Louisa, dear, an humble mind 'Tis beautiful to see, And you shall never hear a word To check that mind from me: But ah! remember, pride may dwell Beneath the woodbine's shade; And discontent, a sullen guest, The cottage hearth invade. CAROLINE. I will be gay and courtly, And dance away the hours, Music, and sport, and joy shall dwell Beneath my fairy bowers; No heart shall ache with sadness Within my laughing hall, But the note of love and gladness Re-echo to my call. MOTHER. Oh! children! sad it makes my soul To hear your playful strain; I cannot bear to chill your youth With images of pain. Yet humbly take what God bestows, And, like his own fair flowers, Look up in sunshine with a smile, And gently bend in showers. CHOICE OF PAINTINGS. WILLIAM. I choose the racked Ixion, With his fierce and burning pain; I love to see the pencil's touch Such awful mastery gain. LADY. Yet let the thrilling punishment, Its moral truth inspire, And keep your spirit pure, my son, Untouched by base desire. LITTLE ELIZA. I'll take the watermelon, With seeds so black and nice, And give my little playmates, All round, a famous slice. But oh! 'tis but a picture, And on a summer's day, If they would not let me eat it, I would wish it far away. HENRY. Give me the brave Napoleon, With his war steed thundering by, Where the snowy Alps majestical, Look upward to the sky. LADY. Oh! boy, that conqueror leaped o'er hearts, With reckless cravings too, While his own was cold and tempest stirred, As the mountain scene you view. LITTLE JOHN. I choose the views of Lilliput, Where the tiny people play, Looking with great astonishment, At birds more large than they; While two of them with all their might, Attempt an egg to roll; And some are diving, quite alarmed, Within a little bowl. GEORGE. Oh! give me Ariadne, With her soft and dewy eye, Her lip of glowing coral, And her forehead fair and high. I feel th' Ægean breezes, As they fan her braided hair, And cool her chastened beauties, Nor leave a dark tinge there. MARIA. I love the finished manliness, That dwells on Bacchus' brow— Where Earth and Inspiration, Seem boldly mingling now. The sunny hue of India Glows burning on his cheek, And lights those lips so eloquent, That ask not words to speak. LADY. Yes! o'er the form that Guido limn'd Our eyes enraptured stray, And thrill with sudden joyousness, As if 'twere new to-day. Fine chain of soul-formed sympathy, Electrical and strong, Which, touch'd with by-gone intellect, Through time is borne along! I bless you, bright creations Of Painting's magic art, Where classic dreams of poesy In local beauty start! Ye raise our cramped and earth-bound souls To His creative power, Whose sacred touch, omnipotent, Gives genius its high power. “OF SUCH IS THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN.” Oh! why should children fear, When sickness dims the eye, To lie down in the grave, And innocently die; Since Jesus Christ his word has given, That such as they shall enter Heaven? Then weep not, parents dear, Because we go above, We leave you here below, To seek a tenderer love; For Jesus Christ his word has given, That such as we shall enter Heaven. Sigh not o'er our pale brows, Where death has set his seal; Nor shrink at those chill hands, That have not power to feel, For Jesus Christ his word has given, That such as we shall enter Heaven. Muse often on our graves, But not in stern despair; Celestial thoughts will spring And teach kind lessons there; And ask, if Christ his word has given That parted friends shall enter Heaven. Let our young playmates come, And view the grassy mound, And plant their early flowers As if 'twere happy grounp; For Jesus Christ his word has given, That such as they shall enter Heaven. Let old men wander here, And with a natural sigh, Think why we've reached our home When they are lingering by; And ask if Christ his word has given, That their grey hairs shall enter Heaven. And let the worldly come, Pause on their busy way, And while a transient tear, Rolls o'er our lifeless clay, Ask their own hearts, if Christ has given His word, that they shall enter Heaven. Let sinners come alone, And bow down o'er our dust, And crush each wicked thought, And seek a better trust; For Christ to them no hope has given Except repentant, to his Heaven. We pray that all may come This solemn truth to see, If dust to dust, then soul to soul Must be the great decree. Where can so bless'd a spot be given To learn of God, and think of Heaven? HOMESICKNESS. The morning sun shines brightly, But it shineth not for me; The breeze is blowing lightly, But my spirit is not free. There's many a hand to meet me, But mine is sadly given; I thank the friends who greet me, But my heart is chilled and riven. My former home was lowly, And this is rich and rare, But to me 'tis melancholy, And that was bright and fair. I know here is much smiling, And graceful, easy mirth, And ways of kind beguiling, And words of gentle birth; And I try to check my sadness, And look as bright as they, And call a fitful gladness To wile the long, long day. I sometimes think 'twould cheer me To taste one little draught Of the streamlet that ran near me, Which in infancy I quaffed. If I could but see my mother, And press her cheek to mine, Or take my darling brother, His flaxen hair to twine. If e'en my loving dog were here To eat from out my hand, I think I should not shed a tear Amid this stranger band. YOUTH. I saw a streamlet flow, With sparkles bright and free, Still dancing to and fro, To meet the rolling sea. It heeded not the rock, Whose shadow frown'd about; It heeded not the shock, Of gnarl'd roots spreading out. And when a careless hand, Disturb'd its sparkling breast, And loos'd its wavy band, It dimpled into rest. On, on the streamlet went, Beneath the burning noon; On, onward in content, Beneath the midnight moon. And thus in gay delight, Does youth in beauty play, Through visions of the night, And pastimes of the day. EVENING HYMN. 'Tis evening, and the skies With starry lights are spread; How very fair the moonbeams rise, And silver radiance shed. I will retire to rest, 'Neath Heaven's o'er-arching sky, And feel my nightly visions blest, For God is watching by. And if the wing of death Should sweep o'er my repose, Resign'd, I'll yield to Him my breath, And rise as Jesus rose.</field>
