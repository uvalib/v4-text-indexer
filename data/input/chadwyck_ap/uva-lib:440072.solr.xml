      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. CALAYNOS: A TRAGEDY. DRAMATIS PERSONÃ. Calaynos, A wealthy nobleman. Don Luis, His friend. Don Miguel, Gentleman of Seville Don Lopez, Gentleman of Seville Oliver, Calaynos' secretary. Soto, Don Luis' servant. Friar Gil. Baltasar, Calaynos' servant. Pedro, Calaynos' servant. DoÃ±a Alda, Wife to Calaynos. Martina, Her maid. Four Usurers, a Forester, Servants, &amp;c. Scene, Calaynos' Castle, Seville, and the neighborhood. PROLOGUE. Look not, grave critic, for perfection here; No gods and goddesses shall move your ear; My little stage mere men and women fill,â All have some good to love, to hate some ill; A hundred springs of action move each mind, And in their mean the character you'll find. Interests and feelings, base and good, have they; Some draw towards heaven, and someâthe other way Arcadian virtue and Arcadian crime, In abstract form, may crowd the Epic clime; But 'tis the Drama's task the world to show, Where bad and good alternate gloom or glowâ Where in each mind are various passions fixed; Virtue with vice, and vice with virtue mixed. Some lean to virtue, some to vice give way; But neither bent has undivided sway. Our plot turns on the loathing which they feel, Who draw their spotless race from proud Castile, For those whose lineage bears the faintest stain Of the hot blood which fires the Moorish vein. No time can reconcile, no deed abate, For that one taint, the haughty Spaniard's hate: As the sound man the loathsome leper shuns, So pass Castilians by Granada's sons. This is the key which gives our plot to viewâ Turn o'er the leaf, the way is clearâadieu! ACT I. SCENE I. The Great Hall in Calaynos' Castle. Enter Pedro and Baltasar, carrying bundles. Pedro. I like not this journey to Seville. Baltasar. O, you like nothing that savors of gentility. Ped. How can I like it? I tell you this genteel savor is deadly. I 'd as soon die by sprats as by turbot. I 've a rhyme in my head. Balt. And a rind over that: what is it? Ped. âWhen a Calaynos shall go to Seville, Then sure that Calaynos shall go to ill.â My grandam taught me that. She could read, and was a great diviner, with a beard that would make two of yours. She told fortunes by the way a cat jumped, or a sparrow flew; and as often hit the truth as the wisest of your scholars. If she hit it not, then was not the thing fore-ordered; and she left that for the schoolmen to wrangle about. Why does my lord go, Baltasar? Balt. To do homage for his lands, as all vassals must. The king granted his ancestors lands; and my lord must acknowledge the king's right and sovereignty, as he holds the land from his forefathers. Ped. I know nothing of his aunt's sisters and his four fathers. If he had them, then was not his mother an honest woman. How many people go to the making of your one great lord! Now, I was turned out indifferent well; and, as I hope for grace, I had but one father, Haroun the Falconer, and no lands. Mayhap, some day, the king will take back his lands. Then what use are my lord's four fathers, more than my one? Balt. 'T would pose him to do that. Ped. Here 's another wise thing! Is that a king's bounty? My lord says, âSir king, I'll keep what 's my own most faithfully.â Says the king, âYou may keep what 's not mine.â âThank you most humbly, for nothing,â say my lord; and so they part. That's worth a journey to hear! Why, a fool can see through it. Balt. So I see. Ped. If you see, you are a fool, and fell in a fool's trap. Balt. So I see again, I fell in a fool's trap. Take up your traps, good fool, and be off; for here comes my lord. [Exeunt with their bundles.] (Enter Calaynos and DoÃ±a Alda.) DoÃ±a Alda. Nay, dear Calaynos, go not hence to-day. Since morn, the clouds have hugged the hidden tops Of the rude peaks that gird our mountain home; Nor could the fiercest northern blasts shake off Their close embrace. But now, in one huge mass, The sluggish vapors down the mountains' sides Roll like an inundation. Well thou know'st That signs like these portend a coming storm: Therefore, until the storm is past, delay; For nothing urges this immediate haste. Calaynos. To please thee, Alda, I'll remain to-day. But, for a mountain maiden, thou hast grown Strangely afraid of gentle summer showers; Perchance thy love exaggerates the fear. Thou 'rt not thus chary to expose thyself Even to the blasts which chilling winter blows. DoÃ±a A. If not to-day, why go to-morrow morn? Or why next day? Or why go'st thou at all? If thou wilt go, then let me go with thee. An hour, and I'll be ready: I shall need But scanty preparation to set forth. Cal. Thou hast forgotten. But a moment since, Thy fear was brewing a fast-gathering storm; Which thou, in fancy, on the mountains saw'st Resting its threatening front. Alda, I see That 't is thy fond intent to win my mind From what I must perform. Long since in death My father closed his eyes; yet ancient rites, Which seigniors owe their liege, by me unmarked, Their term of grace have passed. But now the king. By stiff set phrase of law, allegiance claims, And homage due demands. DoÃ±a A. Far be it from me To counsel breach of law. Nay, go thou must; But why not I with thee? Shall I thus pine, Shut, like a cloistered nun, in these dark walls, Whilst thou with retinue and pomp of power Seville mak'st wonder?âBeautiful Seville! Of which I 've dreamed, until I saw its towers In every cloud that hid the setting sun; Saw its long trains of youths and maidens fair Sweep, like a sunlit stream, along the streets; Saw its cathedrals vast, its palaces, Its marts o'erladen with the Indies' spoils, Its galleys rocking at the crowded quays; Heard its loud hum by day, its airs by night Struck from guitars, that guide the busy feet Of rosy youth across the springing ground. Methinks the moon shines brighter on Seville, And every star looks larger for mere joy! And then, Martinaâ Cal. Ah! Martina?âso. DoÃ±a A. But, dear Calaynos, thou 'lt not blame the girl: She in Seville was born; her youthful days, When the heart easiest takes impress of joy, Were in Seville all past. Martina says That 'mong the ladies there none could o'ertop In state or retinue, or worship paid By all the glittering throng that girds the throne, The bride of great Calaynos. Cal. Alda, cease: Thou 'rt pleading 'gainst thyself: nor dost thou know How frail the fabric of the dream-wove vision, When cunning Fancy plies her golden hand. DoÃ±a A. What meanest thou? Cal. Martina told but half: Or did she tell how Sloth and Beggary, Closely attended by their handmaid Vice, Stare, with lack-lustre and ferocious eyes, Into the porch of every palace-gate? How Want creeps forth at night with tottering pace, And 'gainst the windows of the revellers Flattens its pinched and wasted features out, Cursing the feasts for which one half the world Labors unpaid? And, Alda, did she tell Of marketable crime, of sin for sale? Of multitudes neck-deep in ignorance, Toiling with murmurs 'neath a servile yoke, Checked and o'erawed by bayonet and axe? How they who bend to power, and lap its milk, Are fickler and more dangerous far than they Who honestly defy it? How jealousy Consumes their hearts who most caress and woo it? Know'st thou the slippery falsehoods of the Court, Where every step is on a quaking bog, Where men spend lives on hopes and promises, And pine on smiles, and starve on smooth-told lies? Thou know'st not this; nor shall thy rustic mind, Pure as the Guadalquiver, ere it flows Past the foul sluices that Seville outpours, Know aught of it. DoÃ±a A. If thou wilt have it so, I needs must stay. But I shall count the hours, And chide along the slow-paced summer days: For thou art all with whom I dare to mate,â A lonely queen, without a court or friend. And, losing thee, thou leav'st me with these walls; Whose forms I'll hate, because they rise between Thee and myself. Ah! it is very sad To be shut up, for days and days together, With these old portraits of thy ancestorsâ That look like Moors, though they be Christian menâ All mailed and helmed, whose knit and warlike brows Beneath their casques send forth a settled scowl, Darkening the hall; or see, like shadows, come The old retainers, by my presence awed, To beg some leave they need not have besought. What gloomy state! Martina calls me Proserpine. Cal. Again Martina! Love, I fear thy maid Has put these vagrant fancies in thy head. I never liked her bold, pert, city modes: With upturned nose she treads the castle floors, As if she thought the very air might breed Some loathsome plague. Then at our festivalsâ Time-worn, though quaint and homely they may beâ A supercilious smile comes o'er her face; As if she, fallen from paradise, perforce Endured the antics of rude savages. I like not that her busy tongue should stuff Thy open ears, who 'rt ever ripe for change, With all the worn-out tinsel of a town; And breed in thee a discontent for state Which many a queen might pine with envy for. DoÃ±a A. Calaynos, thou dost rate my girl too hard. I wonder not that she, a city maid, Should sometimes long for the more joyous scenes With which her memory mocks our quiet life. Cal. Well, let her goâshe is no slave of mine. DoÃ±a A. Her love for me has forged a stronger chainâ Cal. Her love for thee! Nay, Alda, there are those Who love to live where they may scold and frown, And toss their heads at everything they see: So, by affected knowledge, seem above All the poor fools that round them wondering crowd. Such is thy maid. DoÃ±a A. Calaynos, truce to this. Martina loves me; shall I throw her off? Cal. I do not urge it. But thou 'rt lately grown Strangely ill-humored with thy dwelling-place, And vexed and discontented with thyself. Come to the casement; look from these huge walls, Whose massive strength has held a king at bay, Down on the ripening fields of yellow grain; Let thy eyes roam o'er swarming villages, Busy with life and filled with happy hearts, Far to the hills that, with their smoky heads, Hem in the view and guard our favored vale. Round this domain the proudest bird of air Could scarcely circle with an untired wing;â All this is thine. O, what a field for good Lies here outspread before thee! Life employed In ministration to this grateful land, Would win for thee a place beside the saints. DoÃ±a A. Have I not ever given, at morn and eve, To all the ragged band that throngs our gate? Cal. This is but half the task of charity. Seek out the needy, cheer the wretched mind, Urge on the slothful, pour thy spirit's balm On wounds which time has fretted to the quick; Counsel the weak, and make the strong more strong: The soul has urgent need for faith and hope, More pressing and immediate than the wants The choking sailor feels upon the wreck. DoÃ±a A. Why, now, my lord, thou 'dst make a nun of meâ One of those maids of black-robed charity, Who sometimes hither come, with solemn step, To ask my bounty. Convents are there not, By thee endowed, to feed these starving souls? Cal. Yes; but in works of good there cannot be Too many hands; the task is ne'er o'erdone. Alda, my grave discourse fatigues thy ear.â Well, I must leave thee to prepare my train; My home-bred knaves are slack at setting forth, And I must urge them. Farewell, love! DoÃ±a A. Farewell! [Exit Calaynos.] Thus comes he ever with that thoughtful brow; Thus goes he ever with that calm, cold mien; Thus would he ever be, thus passionless, If all the world were hissing in his face! More like a father than a husband heâ O! how could love for me usurp abode In such a heart! Martina, are you there? (Enter Martina.) Martina. My lady, did you call? DoÃ±a A. Come hither, girl. O, what a sermon has been preached to me! Mar. On what? by whom? DoÃ±a A. By whom but by my lord? And what the subject, think you, of his speech? Mar. On the regeneration of the world; Taking his text from Plato; quoting large, In Greek and Hebrew, to make clear the fact That two and two make four. Good Lord! they say He talks the Cura out of countenance; And so comes down upon the good man's head, With hints of things above his scope of thought, That he, both night and morning, prays kind Heaven To keep your lord from utter heresy. DoÃ±a A. You have shot wide the mark; for charity Was all he taught. Mar. Ho! ho! he 'd have you mount, Like a mad nun, upon a sumpter mule, And ride the country down, to vex the sick With nauseous draughts; or have you thrust your face In the affairs of every poor, proud man; So would you gain wry mouths for recompense, Or haughty curses. DoÃ±a A. Peace, you rattlepate! My lord but thinks of benefits to man; His every wish and act inclines to good. And sometimes, in the dead and hush of night, When evil thoughts dare scarcely walk abroadâ When loneliness and fear half play the part Of humble holiness, and force the heart, Despite its wicked bent, to virtuous plansâ Some random word, which he, in passing, dropped On the light fallow of my wavering mind, Springs up and blossoms, with a promise fair; But with the morning dew dries up the fruit, And I laugh down, as weak and childish fright, What, 'chance, an angel whispered in my ear. Mar. Dear madam, you have grown as grave and sad As your sage lord, by pondering o'er such things: I prithee, drive them out with gayer thoughts; Or all within the castle may become A band of nuns and sourest anchorites. DoÃ±a A. Yet there is much of moment in these things, Could we, of fickle purpose, deem them so. Mar. Lady, I heard an old physician say That melancholy is the chiefest spring Of raving madness. Dwell not on such thoughts. DoÃ±a A. And would you rob me of my very thoughts, The only things I have to wile the time? What can I do, but think, and think, and think, In this unvarying castle? Mar. There it is! Could you but see Seville in all its pomp, As I have seen it, when the Court is there! Could you but see our king ride through the gate, Decked like the east when morn first opes her eye; Hear the loud flourishes of trump and drum, The glad huzzas, the rattling musketry, The pealing bells, the thundering cannon-shots; See the great ships, the ocean's swans, bedecked With silken banners, of all shapes and dyes; The courtiers see, the proudest stars of Spain, In one grand constellation sweep along; Then think that you, the brightest star of all, Might blot them half with your superior light!â Madam, my lord is wise to keep you here, In total ignorance of your rank and power; Once knowing these, and gaining but your due, 'T would stretch his arm to keep you from your rights. DoÃ±a A. But he has no desire for this gay court. Mar. He! why, to him the gay are butterflies, Flitting around a light of which they die. He looks on pleasure as a kind of sin; Calls pastime waste-time. Each to his trade, say I. I heard a man, who spent a mortal life In hoarding up all kinds of stones and ores, Call one, who spitted flies upon a pin, A fool, to pass his precious lifetime thus! What might delight you, lady, may not him; And yet your pleasures argue you no fool, Nor his grave brows prove a philosopher. DoÃ±a A. Stop, malpert girl! you 're trenching on my love; Your glibly-flowing tongue must not presume Too far upon the license I allow. Thus every day, of late, I 've caught you up, About to strike a side-blow at my lord. Mar. Pardon me, madam, if I went too far. Of late my silly brain has been perplexed With a great problem, which I cannot solve. Thus runs the question: Who are wise, who fools? The man with heavy brows and solemn thoughts Looks on the gay as blanks in fortune's wheel; But then the fool laughs in his sapient face. At this the sage flies in a windy rage, And calls hard names, and works his angry liver To bilious fits, which end the good man's days; When laughs the ribald jester more and more. Now, which is wiser? He who frowns and scolds, And views sweet nature in a sallow light; Or he who takes what pleasure comes to hand, Gleaning some honey from the bitterest flowers, And, when death scowls, smiles in his hideous face? Can you resolve? DoÃ±a A. Not I, philosopher. Your gentle education has nigh spoiled A most complete, well-mannered waiting-maid. But there walks Oliver, in sober thought; Call him; perchance he can resolve your doubts. Mar. Yes, there he goesâjust see him, mistress dear!â Backward and forward, like a weaver's shuttle, Spinning some web of wisdom most divine, I warrant you. Observe his solemn brows, His monk-like gait, his cap without a plume, His stiff and formal clothes, sans tag or braid. There is a nursling of this house of learning!â A man all head, without a heart or sense. Once I made love to him, for lack of work, And got a frown for all my tenderness; Therefore I hate him! I can pardon one Who felt affection, should he turn to hate; But never one who slips my favors by. Shall I address him? DoÃ±a A. If it pleases you. Mar. Ho, Oliver! ho, sage! a mortal callsâ A mortal wandering in dark error's pathâ For light and succor! (Enter Oliver.) Oliver. Did you call me, lady? DoÃ±a A. Martina called you. Oli. Yes, I know her voice. I thought she called for you; her notes are pitched Some octaves higher than your ladyship's, And further heard. DoÃ±a A. Nay, you two jar at once, When brought in contact. Well, you must e'en strike Your angry blows without a witness near. [Exit.] Mar. So, then, you think my voice is over shrill For your soft ears, attuned to Plato's spheres! Oli. Why did you call so loud, I walking near? Mar. You near! I thought you half way up to heaven: How can a man be where his mind is not? Wherein consists this thing which you call Iâ In your gross flesh, or in your heaven-born spirit? Oli. Strive not to vex me with such mockery. All your pert smartness, and your sallies shrewd, Are spent with loss on ears as dull as mine. Mar. Ugh! man, but I do hate you! Oli. Hate me, then. Mar. Our clay, the preachers say, was warmed to life; But yours, your dull, cold mud, was frozen to being. I would not be the oyster that you are, For all the pearls of wisdom in your shell! Oli. A truce to this! I haul my colors down; I have no means to fight your light-armed tongue. But I must warn youâfor I late o'erheard The words which you with Lady Alda heldâ That if you urge your sensual doctrines more, To the pollution of my lady's thoughts, My lord shall know it. Mar. Pshaw! I meant no harm. Oli. I know not what you mean, but harm you do Mar. Why talk you thus, you demi-atheist? I 've heard you hold a creed against the church, Which, spread abroad, might overturn the world, And send us all unbaptized to the pit. They say you have no faith in good men's prayers; And talk not of salvation, but progression.â Are these things so? Oli. Are you Inquisitor? Mar. Did you say aught against the Holy Office? Oli. No word, to you, O, pious Catholic! Mar. Ambassador from cloud-land, take your leave I do not wish to vex an oracle; And we have bandied words enough to-day. Oli. I go; but keep my warning in your mind. [Exit.] Mar. That man of learning has a lynx's eye I'll be more circumspect: it will not do To have the great Calaynos at my ears; To leave behind a home as warm as this, Where I'm half mistress of whate'er it holds, Again to struggle with the ruthless world: Yet to Seville I'll go for wantonness. Well, we shall see what woman's craft can do Against the brains of two philosophers. [Exit.] SCENE II. The Study of Calaynos. Enter Oliver. Oliver. I do not like this journey of my lord'sâ And yet I know not why; the path is safe, And we are guarded by a retinue. 'T is many a year since last I saw Seville; 'T is natural, therefore, I should wish to go: Yet do I not. What can this feeling mean? Is it that influence, o'ermastering will, Presentiment, which pulls me from the wish, And presses on my heart its leaden weight? I 've heard that soundest sleepers will awake When danger steals upon them. It may be The first low knocking of death's pallid hand, Ere he flings wide the gate which shelters life, That so appalls my mind and shakes my purpose. Pshaw! this is idle.âI must e'en end thus, As I began, I do not wish to go. (Enter Calaynos.) Calaynos. Are all things ready for our setting forth? Oli. They are, my lord. Cal. Then, at the break of day, Mount all the train. Oli. You have delayed till then? Cal. Yes; 't was my lady's wish, not my intent. But on the morrow we must sure begone; We do but give our parting lengthened pangs By keeping doubt alive. (Enter a Servant.) Servant. My lord, old Friar Gil is in the hall, And craves admittance. Cal. Friar Gil! how 's this? 'T was but a week ago we met, and then He tottered so beneath his weight of years, He scarce could ope the door that guards his cell. Ser. He seems to walk with pain, and well-nigh dropped Ere we could bring him to the neighboring hall. Cal. Admit him, then. [Exit Servant.] 'T is near a miracle; So feebleâ (Enter Friar Gil.) Friar Gil. Son, my blessing! Cal. Welcome, Father! Thou art fatigued and weakened by thy walk.â What cause has drawn thee from thy cell so far? Such lengthened walks, to one of thy great age, Are full of peril. Why not send for me? Bring a chair, Oliver. [Oliver places a chair.] So, sit thee down. Friar G. I feared to miss thee; as I lately heard That thou design'st a journey to Seville: I came to warn thee from that dangerous step. Cal. Dangerous! What danger do you know or fear? Friar G. None that is certain, every one I fear. Oli. Ha! here 's another seer. [Aside.] Cal. Father, thy path through life was long and hard, And thou hast gathered wisdom by the way; But this idea is baseless fantasy. Friar G. Hear me, Calaynos! As I lay last night Sleepless, but why I know not, on my bed, Telling my beads and thinking o'er my sins, Thy grandsire, as I saw him ere he left This castle for Seville, before me stood, Pointing his hand, through which the moonbeams shone, To a great gash beneath his lifted arm; Then, solemnly and slow, he waved his hand, As if in warning, towards the castle-gate. I strove to speak; but, ere my tongue was loosed, The melancholy shadow passed away. So, with the dawn, I rose to seek thee here: Once turned me back, to 'scape thy lordship's laugh; But, ere three steps were taken, I prostrate fell, Though the path 'neath me was without a stone. It seemed the will of heaven that urged me on, And gave my feeble frame unwonted strength: So have I sought thee, though but half in hope, To overrule thee in this enterprise. Cal. For thy kind zeal I thank thee. 'T was a dream, Bred on a superstition of our house, That to my race Seville brings fated death. Friar G. Has it not been? Did not the one I saw Fall at Seville, struck by a coward's steel Over the wine-cup? So thy father thought; And he did homage by a deputy, As oft I 've heard him say. Go further back; All of thy race shunned, as a plague, Seville. And thou, the last of all the mighty line, The wisest, greatest, without heir or kin, Wouldst tempt thy fate, though nothing urges thee! Cal. This is a thing at which my reason laughs, And naught but actual trial can resolve. Friar G. Go, go, thou headstrong man! Nay, I'll not chide; May God go with thee! I have done my part. [Going.] Cal. Farewell! We'll meet again. Friar G. Perhapsâfarewell! [Exit.] Oli. I hope, my lord, you'll take the Friar's advice. Cal. Take what?âTake hellebore, good Oliver! For you with Friar Gil have lost your wits. Oli. I am not superstitious, as you know; But when I think what greatness hangs on you, And with your fall how much would be o'erthrown, I nigh believe that watchful heaven might send This anxious phantom to avert your ill. Cal. I do not go through stiff-necked stubbornness; I view these rights of homage to the crown As a stale pageant better unperformed, At least by me, who can depute the act. But in Seville I have a most dear friend, From whom, till late, I had not heard for years; And now he writes me in the closest straits, Saying his lands are forfeit for some debts, By knavish means imposed upon his hands: Should the law take its course, his wealth is gone, And he turned forth in utter beggary. Some days ago, I sent him present aid; With promise to redeem his lands from pawn, When at Seville I shall the court attend. Oli. Let me not balk you in this noble act, Though instant peril stare us in the face. Cal. He loves not good who turns from it through fear. O, what a joy is it to have the power That lifts from want the worthy sufferer! What double rapture when he calls us friend, And with that name wipes obligation off! Out, out!âmy heart 's afire, till this be done! Urge on the loiterers,âsee them all prepared To start at dawn,âour speed shall clip the way! [Exeunt.] ACT II. SCENE I. A Street in Seville. Enter Don Luis and Soto. Don Luis. Stand here, good Soto; should a dun come by, Stop the base fellow, ere he gain my door, With some excuse you are so apt at framing; But by no means admit him to the house. Soto. My lord, I'll try, if trying can avail. Of late my stock of lies has run full low, And all my wares are out of date and stale. The creditors have got the wind of me, And strive with tricks to meet my subtlest shifts. For if I say you 're ill, and in your bed, The fellow vows he is a learned leech, For whom your lordship sent. If, to the next, I say you 've gone from town to stay a month, The rogue but asks admittance for a while, To write a line for you, on your return. Another comes hot haste, as if a friend, Pregnant with news which argues you much good; Another bears a letter from the Court; Another has a package, stuffed with rags, As a rare present from a nobleman. I hear they watch all night the city gates, For fear you might escape. Don L. Then say that I Am harbored with a rich, usurious Jew, Who lends me money on my country-house, With which I will discharge their claims ere long. Soto. That will scarce do; they have more knowledge got Of your affairs, of what you hold, what owe, Of what encumbrances are on the lands, Than I conceive your lordship can possess. Don L. Well, well; but put them off, and I'm content. I must be gone; the town begins to wake. [Exit.] Soto. Here 's a fine prospect for an airy breakfast! He thinks I live on moisture from the earth; So stands me here to take my fill of it. Were I an ostrich, there 's a tender stone, Soft as my master's heart, on which I 'd feed; But as a Christian manânay, I'm a saintâ I keep more fasts than all the Calendar: A little out of timeâbut what of that? I'll plead, the Pope has changed the almanac. Last Friday I ate meatâwell, what of that? Sunday and Monday, not a bone saw I. To fast 's the thingâthe deed, and not the dayâ To mortify the flesh, and starve out sin. Some mortified their flesh on Friday last; But I chose Sundayâwho is better now? I mortified my flesh as much as they, Only I took a better day to do it. Lord! who comes here, tricked off in grandad's clothes? So out of fashion, and so rustical! But yet the bumpkin has a noble air, As born for acts above his quality. (Enter Oliver.) Ho, there! why stare you thus at every house, As if you thought the stones could speak to you? You are a stranger, if I judge aright; Can I assist you in your present search? Oliver. Thanks for your courteous speech and kind intent. In truth, I'm puzzled, in this thick-built town, To find the single house for which I look. Soto. Whose is the house? Oli. Don Luis is his name; On whom my lord intends to call ere long. Soto. Here 's a new trick of these cursed creditors! What will they next? [Aside] What station hold you, friend, In your lord's pay? Oli. His secretary I. Soto. 'T is a good place. I once that office heldâ By dint of an inked nail, to recommendâ Under a lord who flits about the Court, For a good twelve-month. But, alas, one day He fell in love, and called on me to write, Then kicked me out of doors. Oli. Why, how was that? Soto. Simple enough,âI could not write a line. Oli. Your impudence but bore its natural fruit. Soto. I thought a courtier's scribe a thing for showâ Part of his state, and not designed for use: So 't would have been, had he not fallen in love. Oli. What station fill you now? Soto. Of every use. When my lord cannot play at dice or cards, He kicks me round his room, to pass the time; Or sets me at some villany, whereby He may be able to resume his play; But the chief thing for which I am employed Is an experiment on human stomachs, To see how little man can eat, and live.â Are you well fed? Oli. More than a week's supply Is set before me daily. If I wished, I might bolt down an ox at every meal; My lord would but admire my appetite. 'T is a strange knaveâI'll lead him further on. [Aside.] Soto. A whole ox! Oli. Nothing less. Soto. Most wonderful! Yours is the place for me, could I but write. But certain services I 've done my lord Unfit me for the changeâso people think. Is your lord rich? Oli. The richest man in Spain. Soto. What wages have you? Oli. All he has is mine, Were I disposed to use it. Soto. He 's generous! Oli. Free as the air, which all alike may breathe. Soto. His name? Oli. Calaynos. Soto. Fiends and furies seize me! Why did I talk this way about Don Luis? All the town knows itâhe must hear it soon; But yet he may not, if we manage right. [Aside.] What man of lordly gait now hither comes? By his brave port, a more than common man. Oli. That is my lord Calaynos. Can you tell Where this Don Luis dwells, for whom we search? Soto. Down yonder street. ... I must be off apace, To give Don Luis timely note of this.â O, what a fool, to slander thus my master! [Aside.] [Exit running.] Oli. Ho, fellow, stop! (Enter Calaynos.) Calaynos. Why do you call so loud? Oli. I held discourse with one of those poor knaves, Whom the world forms to play at foot-ball with; A rascal by compulsion, not by nature, With something good beneath his villany, Turned all awry by outward circumstance. The knave had much intelligence and wit, Appeared acquainted with this mazy town, And seemed to know where good Don Luis dwells; But ere I pressed him past an empty hint, The fellow fled as if a fiend pursued. Cal. So, then, you have not found Don Luis' house. What hint gave your companion of my friend? Oli. He pointed widely down yon narrow street, But to no single house. I must inquire. Cal. Come, I will aid you; thus may we save time; For I am sick of everything I see. In this huge city virtue is close housed, And dares not show her face for very shame; While vice and folly, like two brazen drunkards, Reel up and down the streets from morn till eve, Bullying the peaceful passers with their threats. Pah! what a purge of country air 't will need To drive this festering sickness from my brain! We must shut eyes and ears, good Oliver, Or we'll go home two railing misanthropes. Come, let us on; and when we find my friend, We will have plucked at least one precious pearl From out this sea of misery and vice! [Exeunt.] SCENE II. A Room in Don Luis' house. Don Luis alone. Don Luis. All the supply of gold Calaynos sent At length has dwindled to a single coinâ Curse on my luck! the cards will never change. By heaven! I swear, if ever I grow richâ By some unthought of chance, unborn as yetâ I'll shun all gambling from that very hour. But, being ruined, I must needs play onâ For what wise gamester ever stopped in loss?â Hoping, by lucky change, to win all back With double interestâfortune's usury. 'T is villanous! for me, a gentleman, To be thus kenneled like a dangerous cur; Shut up by day, to prowl abroad at night, And forage scantly on my neighbor's fold [Knocking.] Who 's there? Soto. (Without.) Unbar the door. 'T is I, my lord. (Don Luis opens the door. Enter Soto.) Don. L. You, Soto? Pray, what brings you back so soon? Soto. Good news, my lord; up to your highest wish! The wealthy friend, of whom you lately spoke, Is in Seville, and seeking for your house. Don L. Why not conduct him hither, dull-brained dog? Soto. And mar your plot! No; I'm too old for that. I threw him off the scent, and ran with speed To warn you, seÃ±or, how to take the man. You have not met your golden friend for years: Mark my advantage,âI just quit his presence. Lord! seÃ±or, here 's a man to talk about Before one's breakfast! That 's my time of day: Like a stopped clock, I point the self-same hourâ Just before breakfast! See my shivering hand Upon this sinking buttonâmark the dial-plate! Is there a clock in Spain that plainer says, Just before breakfast? Ah! you flirt away: I see my stomach does not gnaw your ribs. Have you a bone hid? Don L. Pish! what of Calaynos? Soto. O wonders! miracles! He 's not content To feed his servants as your common lords: No, noânot he! His secretary says, If they complain of hungerânote his wayâ He simply drives a live ox down their throats, Horns, tail, and all! There 's rural luxury! There 's doing dinner on a royal scale! That I call living! Don L. Sirrah, shall I give Your hungry ribs an outside dressing? Soto. Nay; Your pounded meat is my aversion, seÃ±or. But, O, this anaconda way of lifeâ This swallowing oxen with my appetiteâ This blissful dream of always being full, Squeezed out all baser matter from my brain. Don L. I'll beat your prating skull till you talk sense. [Seizes Soto.] Soto. What, break the vessel of your own salvation! Sink ship, chart, compassâ Don L. Soto, now by heaven!â [Strikes him.] Soto. I'm down, I yield; you have persuaded me. Calaynos comes to aid our suffering virtue: For, by some words his secretary dropped, And by the outward bearing of the man, I deem him one for noble actions fitâ A generous mind, above suspicion quite; Yet with an eye that looks through outward things Into the soul, if once aroused to doubt: Therefore be wary. Don L. Fear me not, good Soto. You 've shown a shrewdness that I dreamed not of. Soto. But above all, beware the man of inkâ A kind of humble friend to great Calaynos; More of a worldly turn than is his master: He might walk safely o'er the roughest path, While his lord tripped by gazing at the stars. You may betray the lord before his eyes, But not the secretary, on my life. [Knocking] Don L. Heard you a knocking? To the window, quick! Soto. (Looking out.) They 've come, the two, his lordship and the scribe; Looking like hares before a tempting trap. Shall I go down and let the conies in? Don L. Ay, quickly; shut your mouth, you grinning knave! [Exit Soto.] Now for another step in villanyâ Pshaw, pshaw, no scruples! I have left the path Which leads to good, so far from where I stand, That all return is worse than hopeless now. What if I should confess? Would he forgive? No, he would shun me as a spotted lazar! What tells me to confess?âSome mocking fiend, That fain would snatch the prize within my grasp. It cannot be; I was not formed for good; To what fate orders I must needs submit; The sin not mine, but His who framed me thusâ Not in my will, but in my nature lodged. Formed as I am, I have no choice of fate; But must achieve the purpose of my being. Therefore away, ye cheating fantasies! That would decoy me from the thing I 'd clutch, Then leave me poor, and wickeder than ever. He is a fool who acts not for himself; A worse than fool, who chases airy virtue, And gains but knocks and hatred for reward. Yes, I will grasp the stable goods of life, Nor care how foul the hand that does the deed. Hark! they are coming. Actor, to thy part! (Enter Calaynos, Oliver, and Soto. Don Luis and Calaynos embrace apart. Oliver and Soto advance.) Oliver. You here! and pray, my friend, how came you hither? Soto. This is our house; and there my master stands, Doing his duty to your lord Calaynos. The house is small, and scant of furniture; But you'll find rich apartments in our hearts, Where you may lodge until the walls decay. Oli. What, he your lord! You 're surely jesting me: You made me think, but half an hour ago, Your lord the chiefest villain in Seville; Called him a common gamester; said he lived By cheatery of all kinds and qualities! But sure Don Luis is a worthy man,â You, a deceiving trickster! Soto. So I said: But I'm the greatest liar in Seville; A bastard born, and therefore false by nature. My family, sir, before me, all were liars; 'T is an infection that invades our blood; For which I'm bound no more than is a king For the bright crown that tops his stately browsâ Coming by course of nature, not desert! I love to lie; 't is naught but romance-making, Spoken, not writâfor I'm too poor to print. I could tell tales would make Quevedo stareâ But not malicious ones; and if believed, How proud am I, as proving truth to nature! I was but practising my art on you. See how you stare, what admiration show! Here 's glory for an author, quits my pains. Yet have I done my lord no grain of harm, Now all the lie is out. Poor, honest man! Why, sir, his honesty brought on these straits. Oli. Cease, you mad dog! perchance you 're lying now. Soto. Not I; you here may trust me without fear; Beneath this roof I do not dare to lie. My standing here is most undoubted, seÃ±or; So is my callingâ Don L. Soto! Soto. As you must perceive. [Retires.] Oli. I half suspect this fellow told the truth When first we met. I do not like the looks Of him he calls his master, yon Don Luis. Then the unnatural boast about his lying.â It may be so; for I have known some men Who boast of crime, as if they spoke of virtue; And hang their sins out as for ornament, Merely to make the wondering audience stare. The morbid wish to be observed of men Makes heroes of our dying criminals, And adds a goad to crime. But yet I'll watch; This limping story does not satisfy. [Retires.] (Calaynos and Don Luis advance.) Calaynos. So, poor companion, thou art hunted down By these base creditors; thy house besieged, Thy actions spied, sweet liberty infringed; God's very air thy troubled bosom breathes, Shut up in this close mansion. Why not write, Ere hardship fell upon thee? Why not fly, And seek me out among my native hills, Where I with open arms had welcomed thee? Don L. It was with fear that I disclosed my state, Half doubting this return from even thee: For we were sundered in the May of youth, Nor since have held communion. Ah, I thought Thou, like my other friends, hadst callous grown. Cal. How thou didst wrong me! Don L. Wronged thee, noble man! Yes, I can ne'er forgive the thoughts I bore 'Gainst thee, and 'gainst the race of man entire. For I have stood at bay before the world, Facing the wolves that well-nigh pulled me down; Until I deemed mankind a hungry pack, Eager to suck their wounded brother's blood. But thou hast come to purge me of my gall, To heal my wounded heart, to dry my tears, And plant within my soul a love for man, Which, by Heaven's grace, wrong never shall uproot. Cal. Dost thou remember, Luis, when we sat Remote from men, yet planned to mankind good? What dreams we dreamed, what projects grave we formed, To guide our lives when we to manhood came? And thou wert ever first in these designs; Formed broader projects, gave a greater scope To thy sweet fancy, than thy backward friend: And wast thou first to plan these goodly deeds, Yet last to bear them out? Ah me! I fear The sprouts of fancy most luxuriant shoot In shallowest soils; and, when most forward seeming, Oft-times but weak of root! Don L. It so has seemed. Calaynos, hadst thou borne what I have borne, Thou wouldst not be so gracious to mankind. Thou hast been nursed in wealth and luxury, Thy every wish been father to the deed: Thou, from o'erflowing means, hast freely given That which it cost thee nothing to impart: But I, through bad men's acts, have fallen from wealth, Nor know one day if I may feed the next; So that the coin which I a beggar give A moment wavers 'twixt his need and mine. Cal. Luis, you know not of the years I 've spent, In patient study and unwearying search, To learn the wants of man. I have digged down Into the very roots and springs of things: All moral systems, all philosophies, All that the poet or historian wrote, All hints from lighter books, all common sayings,â The current coin of wisdom 'mong mankind,â Time-hallowed truths, and lies which seem like truths, I have turned o'er, before my mental eye, Seeking a guide to lead me on to good; And find, the chiefest springs of happiness Are faith in Heaven, and love to all mankind. Don L. This is a noble creed, above my reachâ A creed for one in ease and affluence; Better in speculation than in deed. Cal. Not so; and thou shalt go, poor brain-sick man, Far from these scenes, to heal thy wounded mind. Beneath my roof thou shalt forget thy cares; And time's soft plumes will brush thy tears away; While I within thee may implant a faith, To bear thee safely through this faithless world. Don L. Thou art too good to one not worth thy love. Cal. Leave that to me. But of the creditors; I long to stuff their hungry maws with gold. Send for them quickly. Don L. Nay, I'll go myself. A walk to me is a rare luxury. Cal. Well, then, we'll seek them. Don L. Nay, I'll bring them here. Repose a while; I will return with speed. [Exit hastily.] Oli. (Advancing.) How fell Don Luis to such poverty? Cal. By the connivance of some common knaves, Who gained his name to certain bonds and deeds Of a vile tool of theirs, that played his friend. Soto. Two scurvy knaves, two knaves of clubs and spades, Took the last real he could call his own. [Aside.] Oli. (Drawing Calaynos away from Soto.) This shows a lack of wisdom on his part. Cal. Nay, Oliver, it shows a trusting mind, Pure from suspicion, a most guileless mind. He is a man whose loving heart was bruised By acts of one whom most of all he loved. For this, I quite forgive his bitterness. Oli. A man like him, reared in a crafty town, With his acuteness, was too easily caught By a most shallow and most bare-faced trick. Cal. Suspect you aught? What, sir, you do suspect? Oli. And I have grounds. Cal. Rash boy, restrain your tongue! Or that might follow which you may repent. I tell you he is pure as yon bright sun. Knaves flourish and grow rich: look round you here; Does this poor house show aught of prosperous crime? If he were wealthy, or o'erblown with pride, I 'd listen to the silly words you speak. I knew him from a child; you catch a glance; And yet you tell me, as a trader would, This gold is counterfeit! These words of yours Savor of cunning low, and not of wisdom. Yet never seek to sprinkle in my ear Your worldly gall! What I will do, I will! Nor you, and all the worldâ Oli. My lord, my lord! Cal. Pardon me, Oliver; thy wish was good, And towards my interest aimed, though shot awry. Think not of what I said. Let us go in: There is a couch; I would repose a while. [Exeunt Calaynos and Oliver.] Soto. Lord! What an actor has my master grown! It takes a gentleman to lie complete. I'm but a blunderer to this mighty man, Who lies by rule, is armed at every point, Ready for each conjecture. 'T is a system To which an humble man can ne'er attain. I do not like that secretary's air: He is too shrewd; and has a busy brain, That ever seeks for plots and deep deceits In all he looks at. For a rustic born, The fellow 's wise enough; but what a fool, What a poor, generous, trusting dolt his lord! Here 's a fine subject for the Don to fleece! Why, we'll grow rich on him, regain our state, And flourish bravely, as we did of old.â But I must warn Don Luis, once again, To keep an eye upon the cunning scribe. [Exit.] SCENE III. A Street in front of the Exchange. Enter four Usurers, meeting First Usurer. What is the news on 'Change? Second Usurer. Of great import 'T is said the Court to-morrow leaves Seville; When all the chiefest gentlemen of Spain, Nobles and commons, follow it of course. Third Usurer. Half of our business gone! That 's news enough To break one's heart. How slow are fortunes made! Here I 've been laboring for a score of years, With scarce a pittance for my daily toil. Second U. O, that comes well from you, who could nigh buy A noble dukedom with one half your means! Fourth Usurer. They say the plague is coming here againâ That the French king is to a war inclinedâ I heard Don Luis sawed his head half off, With a dull knife, to cheat us creditors. First U. That 's sure a lie; for here Don Luis comes. Third U. Nor tries to shun us! What does this portend? (Enter Don Luis.) Don L. Good-day, my friends! Usurers. Good-day, good seÃ±or! Don. L. My friends, I do not wish you should bear loss, By the large loans which you have each advanced; So, by your leave, to-day I'll pay the debts, On slight conditions which you'll not deny. I have a friend in town, of ample wealth, Who'll settle all, without a real's loss, If you keep silent; nor, by word or deed, Say aught of me, or why I raised the loans, Or how I brought myself to poverty. And should he ask for what I owe these sums, You'll say that for a friend a bond I signed, Whose treacherous flight makes me responsible. Are you agreed? Say yes or no: if no, Your only chance for pay is lost. First U. My lord, You are too sudden; give us time for thought. Don L. (Apart to Second Usurer.) Come hither, sir. You are of gentle blood, And, therefore, know what feelings cling to rank; Nor would you shame, by an incautious word, A gentleman who loves you for your birth. I trust your honor; knowing that I lean On that which might uphold a monarch's throne. You'll not betray the secret which I leave, With purest faith, intrusted to your hands. A breath of yours might mar my state for aye, And blot a noble family from the land, To which you are of kinâthough distantly. Second U. Racks shall not wring it from me! Don L. I'm content. The pompous fool! his race cleaned boots for ages [Aside.] Second U. (Aside.) There 's birth and breeding; there 's a gentleman! Called me his cousin! He may trust till doom! [Retires.] Don L. (To First Usurer.) I 'd speak a word apart with you, my friend. First U. What would your lordship? Don L. You 're a prudent man; And would not lose your loan by empty wordsâ Words which may do me harm, but you no good: Therefore, if you desire to use the gold, I charge you give no hint of my affairs To him who pays the debt. Men call you wise, And say you gained your wealth by strictest silence. First U. Trust me, my lord; 't is not my wont to prate When any moneyed business is concerned. [Retires.] Don. L. (To Third Usurer.) Hither, you jackal List to what I say! If you reveal why I'm in debt to you, Or say a word of interest or its rate, Or how I raised the loan, I'll blow a storm Shall drive you naked from Seville to-night! There 's a young nobleman, a gay Don Juan, With whom in trade you were concerned of lateâ Look to itâif you dare to blab a word, His father, old Alfonso, shall know more, Before to-night, than what he dreamed this morn! Third U. Good heavens! you knowâ Don L. Naught that I wish to tell. I have the whip-hand of youâby the gods, I'll make you smoke if you prove restive now! Third U. Fear not, my lord. Don L. Nay, nay; fear me, you leech! Third U. (Aside.) How knows he this? [Retires.] Don L. (To Fourth Usurer.) Come here, you trembling slave! If you by word, or look, or act, or sign, Or hesitating speech, or stammering tongue, Wise looks, or shrugs, which seem to hide a thought, Give any token that you know me else Than as a poor but worthy gentleman, Who suffers through misfortune, not through faultâ If you act thus, by yon bright heaven, I swear I'll drive my dagger half-way down your throat! Fourth U. Good lord, you would not kill me! Don L. Kill you, rogue! Ay, and throw out your carcass to the dogs; Thinking I 'd done the brutes small charity! Fourth U. Dear seÃ±or, I'll be quiet as a mouse. Don L. Look to yourself; my eye will be on you. (Turns to all the Usurers.) Follow me, masters; if you have resolved To act as I proposed. Usurers. We have, my lord. [Exeunt.] SCENE IV. A Room in Don Luis' house. Calaynos and Oliver. Calaynos. What, not yet rid of your suspicious thoughts? Pray cast them off, as unbecoming things, Unworthy to consume the idle time Which you will waste in entertaining them. Suspicious men are like those slinking curs That whine and fly, if we but show the lash, And suffer torture ere they feel a blow. If you will nourish them, I promise you Enough of food to rear your nurslings on; For you will strain and twist his every act To confirmation of your worst suspicions. A falling straw shall make you swear him false, An idle word shall damn him past reclaim; Though he, poor man, be innocent of crime, And all the guilt be harbored in your breast. I 'd as soon be a conscience-hunted felon, As one pursued by packs of fantasies! Oliver. My lord, for you, I'll try to love your friend; But you will pardon, if with poor success. When first I saw him, a cold shudder ran From head to foot; the while my faint heart thumped, Like a great weight, against its prison-house; And when he strained you in his close embrace, I 'd rather have seen a tiger mount your breast. You half believe in these antipathies, That tell, like instinct, of some coming ill; For you are firm of faith in sympathies, Which prove, if they exist, their opposites. Cal. Cease, Oliver; we cannot harmonize. I will not doubt him till I find him false. Oli. Pray give me leave to ask the creditors, Unknown to him, how in their debt he grew? Cal. Yes, for your own repose; I 'd have you friends; If that will satisfy, you have my leave. Now to your writings; here Don Luis comes. (Enter Don Luis and the Usurers.) Don Luis. (Apart to Calaynos.) Here are the creditors; pray treat them fair: 'T will but make foes to chide them for their wrongs; And, as thou know'st, I 've enemies enough. Cal. As you think fit. Come hither, gentlemen, And give your papers to my secretary; He will write orders for their settlement. [To the Usurers.] (Calaynos and Don Luis talk apart. Oliver seats himself at a table.) Oli. This is a large amount for one man's bond. [Aside.] What usury did good Don Luis pay? [To the Usurers.] First Usurer. 'T was not by usury he came in debt; 'T was by a bond, which he endorsed for one Who raised the gold, and then proved false to him. Oli. But where 's the bond? When paid, 't must be erased. First U. (Apart to the others.) The devil! here 's a strait! What shall we say? Don L. (Advancing.) What is the matter with you, gentlemen? First U. SeÃ±or, the secretary wants your bond, Which we forgot to bring. Don L. Nay, nay, not so; 'T was put into my hands as we came here. You gave it, did you not? [To Fourth Usurer.] Fourth Usurer. I did, my lord. [Don Luis retires.] Oli. Baffled! and yet 't is strange! These creditors Take up their pay, as if they felt no shame; Which, were the action guilty, they should show. [Aside.] (Turns to the Fourth Usurer.) Why, sirrah, what a cursÃ©d knave are you, To grasp your cheatings with so meek a face! You 've done a deed might bring you to the oar. You, and your fellows, should march two by two, With iron chains around your villain necks, To seek the hulks, by dint of conscience driven.â You slimy swindler, you vile cozener! Fourth U. Why is it wrong to lendâ (Don Luis advances, playing with his dagger-hilt.) to lendâto lendâ Oli. To lend what, rascal? Don L. Lend my house your room. [To Fourth Usurer.] Have you not paid these men, my gentle friend? [To Oliver.] Oli. I have, sir. Don L. (To Usurers.) Gentlemen, you may depart. [Exeunt Usurers.] Oli. (Aside.) Here was a struggle; but he bore it off; A moment more, and he 'd have been betrayed. Yon man is guilty, though I have no proof. I'll seem his friend, but watch him as a foe: Heaven grant, thereby, I keep my lord from harm! [Retires.] (Calaynos and Don Luis advance.) Don L. My noble friend, what service hast thou done To one unworthy of thy least regard! How like a dew thy gentle acts have fallen On that dry waste, my scarred and thirsting heart! O, may the blessings of a grateful mind Rise up in prayers to Heaven, like evening mists, To fall on thee in balmy freshening showers, Dropped from His hand who smiles on kindly deeds! I'll love my former sufferings from this hour; Since, through my pain, thou hast such rapture wrought. Cal. Cease, cease! Thy words have overpaid the act; If thou proceed'st, thou plungest me in debt; Such gratitude doth shame my blushing gold. But, Luis, to this corner of thy heart, Warmed with the heat of friendship's holy flame, Take not thy friend, unless thou 'lt take mankind; And, for the love of one, love all his race: Many are worthier of regard than I. Don L. I think not so; but thou shalt use my heart As a poor mansion, over which thou rulest: If so thou will'st, call in thy dearest friends; They shall be welcome, though they 're all mankind. Cal. And now make ready to depart with me. I long to have thee breathe my native air, And share such pleasures as my home affords. Don L. An hour, and I'll be with you. [Exit.] Cal. Oliver. Oli. My lord. Cal. Collect the train; we must be gone. Oli. How soon?âTo-day? Cal. Within an hour, at most. Oli. It can be done. Cal. Then haste; your time is brief. [Exit.] Oli. Confusion! He departs with such hot speed, I'll not have time to see the creditors. I purposed to untwist this tangled skeinâ To free the Don, or to confirm his guilt: But this unthought of haste o'erturns my scheme, And leaves me wandering 'mid my doubts and fears. [Exit.] ACT III. SCENE I. A Room in Calaynos' Castle. DoÃ±a Alda. DoÃ±a Alda. O, weary, weary days, how slow ye pass! Flow on, flow on, and bring Calaynos home! Yet why should I desire my lord's return? His presence makes small difference to me: Shut up in his dim study, pondering o'er The yellow leaves of the most learnÃ©d dead, Short time he gives to me; and when he comes, With stately step, and quiet, solemn eyes, He chills the joy that from my heart would burst, With a most dreary smile, or smiling sigh. Yet I do love him, or I think I do.â Pale, melancholy man, thy godlike mind Was rather formed for multitudes to praise, Than for a woman's individual love To spend its wayward feelings on, unawed. No change, no change! Can I be happy hereâ I, running o'er with the hot blood of youth, Eager for action, sick of dull repose, That rusts my spirit with unburnished rest?â I happy! plodding an unvarying round Of sullen days, that slowly crawl to years? My life is like a dammed and sluggish pool, Topped with a scum of foul, green discontent, Which loads my breast, and keeps the sunlight off. (A horn sounds. Enter Martina.) What means that sound? Martina. The warder blew the blast; Your lord and train approach the castle gate. What quick return from dear Seville he makes! Had I been he, I 'd staid from home a year. DoÃ±a A. 'T is a strange taste, his love for these old walls: He oft has said, he passes not an hour, Which he calls happy, when away from them. Mar. Lord! lady, what a speech! Were he well bred, He 'd say from you no happy hour was passed. You were included in the walls, I deem, With sundry other scraps of furniture. I hate a man who rolls in self-content, And needs no one to help his happiness! DoÃ±a A. You hate my lord? Mar. O, no! my lady dear; I spoke, as we unthinking women do, In o'erstrained phrase, that means not what it says. DoÃ±a A. In the brief letter I last night received, He writes, a much-loved friend returns with him, To share what sports our castle can afford. Mar. What sports! what sports!âTo see the half-bred Moors Dance to their pagan drums, on Baptist's day; And howl and rave, as if the maw of hell Had cast its devils up to mar our earth! These are the only sports. The holidays, Except Saint John's, go off with moody shows, Which well-nigh make a Christian woman weep. Who is the friend? DoÃ±a A. I know not: a young man; But yet not named.âHow old do you suppose him? Mar. Thirty in years, and yet a century old! A heart dried up, like one of Egypt's mummies, All balmed and spiced in rare philosophy; A spindle-shanked, lean-visaged, red-eyed youth, With a most rickety and crooked back, That got its set o'er Plato; one who fears To look a pretty woman in the face, Who would begin his prayers if one came near; Who with his senses has not lived a day, Yet ages with his brains. DoÃ±a A. And I suppose, A man much like my lord, of earnest mien, Of grave and reverend looksâincarnate wisdom Made manifest and pure in earthly formâ A man without a sin, or fault, or stain: Such must he be whom lord Calaynos loves. Mar. Would he had brought a gallant gentleman, Such as adorns the splendid court of Spain! A man all smiles and service to us women; Faultless in dress, with a light, dashing air, That wins his way to every lady's heart; A man of wit, in conversation apt, Ready in trifles, with a thorough knowledge Of all the little things which women love; One who can talk of China, or of catsâ Of furs, or frillsâof lace, or Cashmere shawlsâ And be as learned and absolute in these As is your lord in metaphysics' lore: That were a proper manâa man of fashionâ A man of feeling, delicate, refined; Not a great clumsy, learnÃ©d elephant! DoÃ±a A. Hark! they are coming.âGet you in, Martina. Mar. I'll pass this way; for I must see the guest. [Exit.] Calaynos. (Without.) Is DoÃ±a Alda here? Mar. (Without.) She is, my lord! (Enter Calaynos, Don Luis, Oliver, and Soto.) DoÃ±a A. (Embracing Calaynos.) Welcome, my lord. Cal. Dear Alda, in thy joy, Thou dost forget the guest I bring to thee; A guest, and therefore to be welcomed firstâ A friend, and therefore to be welcomed warmly. DoÃ±a A. (To Don Luis.) Pardon me, seÃ±or, if I once offend The courtesy a lady owes her guest. 'T is the first parting we have e'er endured; Therefore our meeting is a strange delight, New and most grateful. You are welcome, seÃ±or, Both as a guest, and as my husband's friend. Don Luis. Ask me no pardon, where is no offence.â Your double welcome I accept at heart, And pray 't may have a long continuance. How beautiful she is!âHeavens, what a gem This barbarous castle has shut up in it! [Aside.] Why came you not, fair lady, to Seville?â The court was there, and all was gayety, Which lacked but you to make the joy complete. DoÃ±a A. The very man whom last Martina drew. [Aside.] 'T was not his will. [Pointing to Calaynos.] Don L. Ah, then you wished to come? DoÃ±a A. My lord's will is my wish. Don L. Most dutiful! Would that all ladies could be taught by youâ 'T would save us aches! DoÃ±a A. (To Calaynos.) My lord, we'll share thy thoughts. Cal. Nay, heed me not. I must retire a while. [Exit.] DoÃ±a A. Perhaps 't would please you, sir, to view the castle? No customary qualities it lacks, Which dignify all huge and antique piles. On every oaken door and painted window There rests a legend, magnified by time; Each tower is tenanted, at evil hours, By other forms than walk its floors by day; No stone but has its story. Some are gay, Some grotesque; some are sad, some horrible. I'll tell you but the cheerfulâshall we walk? Don L. Ay, like the Sultan of the Eastern tale, I'll list a thousand nights with eager ears. [Exeunt.] (Oliver and Soto advance.) Soto. This is a fine old castleâsomewhat musty. Oliver. Ay, 't is the mustiest mansion in all Spain. This castle my lord's race inhabited Beyond all date. Soto. How did they in the flood? Oli. O, they were fishes then, and swam unchoked They were advancing from their primal slimeâ Hatched by the sun on some wide river's bankâ Through worms, fish, frogs, and beasts, upward to men. They lived here monkeys, till their tails wore off, Then became Moors, and last you find them thus. Soto. Why, here 's a pedigree for potentates! That 's why they quarter beasts upon their shields; Relations they to all these rampant brutes. Friend, I shall dread to kill the next mad dog, For fear I spill some near relation's blood. Oli. Fear you to kill a fox! You were a foxâ A cunning, sly, most guilty-minded fox; Your master was a wolf, a dangerous wolf, And you, sly fox, were his first counsellor.â Fear to slay foxes, Soto! Soto. What mean you, sir? Oli. Merely that men were one time animals. My master was a lion, king of beasts; And you two, fox and wolf, once stole his crown, And thought to wear it. Soto. Friend, you speak in riddles. Oli. O no, in fables I. Soto. Speak plainer, Ãsop! Oli. I was a dog,âa faithful, patient cur,â And watched my master while his eyes were closed;â For you had given the king a sleeping draught, Made of a flower called Friendshipâfalsely called! I slew the fox and wolf, regained the crown, And placed the golden circle on his brow:â Now, in the fable, see what beast was I! [Exit.] Soto. This fellow looks through both of us like glass: He 's keener than my lord, and wiser far. Some sunny day, we'll both pitch o'er these walls, And he will be the man that breaks our necks. Ah! 't is a sad thing, Soto, very sad, To be knave's knave, e'en though he be a Don! To take the peril, and do all the work, Then, at the last, come in for all the kicks. My lord must know the fable which I heardâ He'll sleep the lighter for it, on my life! [Exit.] SCENE II. Another Room in the Castle. Enter DoÃ±a Alda and Don Luis. Don Luis. Pray, noble lady, how do you kill time? The constant sameness of a country life Must sometimes bear with weight on your high spirit. DoÃ±a Alda. Kill time, kill time! Ne'er breathe those words againâ At least, not where my lord Calaynos hearsâ If on his good opinion you set store. He uses time as usurers do their gold, Making each moment pay him double interest; He sighs o'er what in slumber is consumed; Robs the lead-lidded god of many an hour, To swell his heaping stores of curious learning. Don L. I hope my words no treason to your ears; I thought not, gentle lady, to offend. But I have lived in cities, from my birth, Where all was noise, and life, and varying sceneâ Recurrent news which set all men agapeâ New faces, and new friends, and shows, and revels, Mingled in constant action and quick changeâ Which things drive on the wheels of time apace; Nor, but for scanty periods, have I known The changeless round of a calm country life. I have not weighed my minutes in fine scales, As lapidaries do the diamond's dust; Content am I to wear life's blazing gem, Nor care what fragments fall in polishing. DoÃ±a A. I have not passed my life in gayeties; Duties, not pleasures, have filled up my days. My lord's domain is large, and peopled thick; Though most are prosperous, some are old, some poor. Those that can hither come, I here relieve; But the more feeble I ride forth to seek, Freighted with goods which ease their present wants. Sometimes, I read old books of chivalry, And fill my wandering brain with idle fears Of dwarfs, enchanters, giants, eldridge knights, That throng the crowded world of old romance. Sometimes, I prattle with my town-bred maid, A girl of wit, who longs to see Seville, And has so filled my ears with her desire, That I 'd fain go, if but to still her tongue. Then there are household duties infinite, Known but to women, which I must discharge. Don L. So, then, at times you are an almoner, At times a romance-reader, next a housewife. These are grave things to spend a life upon! But where 's Calaynos in this catalogue?â Does he not cheer you, in your mournful tasks? DoÃ±a A. Are you his friend, and ask me this of him? He is a scholar of the strictest caste; And from the portal of yon study dim Seldom comes forth into my little world. He is a man of grave and earnest mind, Wrapped up in things beyond my range of thought; Of a warm heart, yet with a sense of dutyâ As how he must employ his powerful mindâ That drives all empty trifles from his brain, And bends him sternly o'er his solemn tasks. Things nigh impossible are plain to him: His trenchant will, like a fine-tempered blade, With unturned edge cleaves through the baser iron.â Such is my lord, a man above mankind. Don L. And can you feel companionship with him, An intellectual demigod, removed From all the sympathies that mark our race? Can your warm woman's heart outpour its griefs, Or share its gladness, with a soul like his? Can you unbidden leap upon his breast, And laugh or weep, as suits your forward mood? He must despise all smiles, and mock all tears: Serene, and cold, and calmâan ice-crowned peak, Towering supreme amid thought's frozen clouds, Above the thaws that flood our vales of life. DoÃ±a A. You 're talking of my husband! Don L. Of my friend. Let me be your friend, lady, I beseech. I fain would see you live in happiness; And his strange coldness cannot bring you peace. DoÃ±a A. Husband and wife need not a go-between. I did not say I lived unhappily; Nor that Calaynos wanted in his love. SeÃ±or, you take wild license with my speech, To twist its meaning to so base an end. I love him, he loves me. Don L. Your pardon, madam: 'T was but the share I take in all affairs, Wherein my friends are mixed. I meant not ill; Nor, willingly, your harmless words would wrest To any sinister or false intent. 'T was a mistake; but such a one might hap In the warm heart of any loving friend. DoÃ±a A. Well-meaning ill the generous must forgive. When next we meet, beware how you uprake The slumbering ashes in the fane of love, Lest you come off with withered hands!âfarewell. [Exit.] Don L. Farewell, thou type of beauty, whom I'll winâ Farewell, thou guileless seat of embryo loveâ Farewell, thou temple of my burning heartâ Thou thief of honorâthou enchantress fair, Who hast upset my nature by thy art, And killed the latest seeds of good in me! Farewell, all gratitude, and friendship's trust! Come, smiling sin, and pour thy honeyed words On tongue and lips, but in my heart pour gall!â Come, thin-robed sin, that show'st thy loveliness, But hid'st thy wickedness and keen remorse! That I may win my love, and hate her lordâ O, when had love a conscience or a fear! [Exit.] SCENE III. The Study of Calaynos. Calaynos. reading, Oliver transcribing a manuscript. Oliver. (Rising.) My lord, this learned manuscript has raised A crowd of strange conjectures in my mind, That rush and jostle through my wildered brain, In wild confusion, without settled purpose. Calaynos. (Rising.) What part stirred up this riot in your head? Oli. That part in which it hints at God's design In the creation of the earth and man. I oft have wondered how omniscient God Could take delight in forming things like men: So full of meanness, yet so full of prideâ So strong in thought, and yet so weak in actâ So foul in nature, so o'ergrown with sin, Yet destined for a sphere 'neath Him alone. What pleasure finds He in our paltry deeds, Begot of selfishness and headstrong will? What feeling moves Him when the puny thing Lifts up his voice, and boldly rails at Him? How deems He, when He sees the myriad souls That speed to deathâtheir destiny forgot, The purpose of their being unachievedâ Seeking, unawed, a hell of their own choosing? Why did He form so fair a stage as this, To dance His trifling puppet, man, upon? And, last, does not this whole creation seem 'Neath His contempt, so far above it He? Cal. Stop, Oliver; you tread on dangerous ground, A mental bog, that quakes beneath your feet. These words would seem to come from humbleness, And low opinion of yourself and man; Yet are engendered by the rankest pride, Arrayed in robes of meek humilityâ Stop! the next step is infidelity. Contempt for man begets contempt for God: He who hates man must scorn the Source of man, And challenge, as unwise, his awful Maker. The next step doubt; and then comes unbelief. Last, you raise man above all else besides, And make him chiefest in the universe. So, from a self-contempt, grows impious pride, That swells your first-thought pigmy to a giant, And gives the puffed-up atom fancied sway. God is! Philosophy here ends her flight; This is the height and term of human reason: A fact that, like the whirling Norway pool, Draws to its centre all things, swallows all. How can you know God's nature to Himself? How learn His purpose in creating man? What 's ultimate to man, remains concealed: Enough for you, to know that here you areâ A thought of God, made manifest on earth. Ah, yet His voice is heard within the heart; Faint, but oracular, it whispers there: Follow that voice, love all, and trust to Him. O, learn, dear Oliver, to pity one, Who wanders in this world without a faith In something greater than his feeble self! Oli. Yet thoughts, like these, will rise in spite of me. Cal. I know it; 't is the taint of primal sin, That mingles with each thought, mars every act, That stains our very good with something ill; And, like the poison which abounds in plants, Mingles its portion with our healthiest food. Oli. Does not this knowledge of man's sinfulness Awake a doubt of individuals, And make you cautious, when you deal with men? Cal. No; I have predetermined trust in man, That never alters, till I find him false. I am above the common herd in power; No rogue can wrong, but in my ample purse; Which I scarce feel, which, had he asked, I 'd given. Oli. 'T is all in vain! I cannot raise a doubt In his ingenuous nature.âThere 's no hope. I have but slender grounds to doubt Don Luis; And my own doubts, perchance, may work me illâ Yet will I go to death, if he 's not false! I, from Seville, will gain the facts I want; Meantimeâ(Aside.) My lord, much of your friend you'll see; For you must hunt, and feast, to pass his time, And show all courtesies that may befit. Cal. Nay; he 's too dear a friend to make a stranger. I will divide my castle and my wealth; Let him use each, as suits his present mood. We will not clash in interests: he may hunt, I study; thus, each may enjoy his bent. Then DoÃ±a Alda will be much with him. Oli. Hum, hum! I like not that, I like not that. [Aside.] Cal. She is so full of life, so fond of change; They two can put their restless heads together, Unhood their thoughts at every whim that flies, And chase the quarry till they bring it down. Oli. Heaven grant, these coupled falcons prove not haggards! [Aside.] (Calaynos reads, Oliver writes. Scene closes.) SCENE IV. A Room in the Castle. Enter Martina. Martina. I wonder where the strangers can have gone! I 've searched the castle o'er, to find them out; Yet, save the glimpse I caught as they came in, Have tried, in vain, to get a peep at them. The master has a gay and courtly air, Which proves him of high birth, and liberal training. The man, too, bears himself in proper trim, And shines, although reflected is his light. 'T is nigh as well to serve a gentleman As to be gentle born; to catch his ways, Follow his manners, and imbibe his tastes; Learn what is graceful, what to be eschewed; Garner the grain, and fling aside the chaff: Till, in the end, the copy may become A finer work than the original. I 've half a mind to fall headlong in love; Certes I will, if he show sign of fire. (Enter Soto.) Soto. Good-day, fair maid! We have not met before. Mar. Good-day, fair sir!âthe better since we meet. I'll show him I can speak as fair as he. [Aside.] Soto. Are you a dweller 'neath this roof above, Or but a passing angel here alit? Mar. Ay, and a treader of this floor beneath! Throw off your lofty style.âI'm not a fool, Nor a plain country maiden, as you think. Soto. Plain you are not; that can I truly sayâ I hope a maiden. Mar. As you are a knave! What if I'm not a maid?âWhat if a wife? I'm still my lady's maid, say what you will. What if a widow? Would you like me less? Soto. Shall I speak plainly? Mar. Plainly as you think. Soto. Then, if a maid, I hold you 'bove all price. If you 're a wife, keep your dear husband hence; I 'd spit the villain, as I would a toad! If your 're a widow, then I think of you As of a nut, when all the kernel 's goneâ As of a fruit, when all the juice is driedâ As of a feast, when all the meats are eatâ As fair outside, but rifled all within! An unclaimed hawk may come to know the lure, And we may teach the haggard as we list; But when once broken, by an unskilled hand, She gains such tricks as training cannot mend. Mar. Why, the dog 's mad in love! (Aside.) I am a maid. Soto. Let me catch breath, and thank you for those words! My blood runs free, that nigh became a mass, Congealed and stagnant, with my freezing doubts! Mar. Come from your stilts. I fain would like you, sir; But you must be familiar, not too lofty. You fly your words above my simple ken. If you'll make love, why, make it like a man, Not like a demigod. We have enough Of word-inflated mortals in our house.â How do you like this place? Soto. O, past all boundsâ That is for you; for one thing else I hate it. Mar. What thing is that? Soto. Be secretâOliver. Mar. You hate him? I do too, most bitterly. The scurvy fool, who fain would be a sage! Soto. The prying knave, who has discovered more Than his dull lord, with all his learning, could! Things are at pretty pass, when servants grow Above their mastersâsaving you and me. Mar. Pray tell me all. Soto. Well, let us walk apart: Some ear, less honest, our discourse might catch. I'll tell you all, for we both pull one way. [Exeunt.] SCENE V. The Park before the Castle. Enter Don Luis. Don Luis. The means, the means!âMy love is cold as snow; I dare not tell her what I burst to say. But she may change; as Hecla sends forth fire From out the ice, which hides its burning heart. But how? Alas, she knows not of my love; Can take no interest in me, uninformed. Did she but know, that might arouse her heart; For half the love of earth from this source springs: First woman 's flattered at the heat she wakes, Then falls in love, to rid herself of debt. I dare not tell her; that might blast the whole, And drive me from her presence unrepaid. Yet she must know; but by some other meansâ Not know, but doubt it. Let that thought once in, No band of angels e'er can drive it out, No force usurp its sway. I'm well convinced She bears no love for her great booby lord: If she be secret, he can ne'er suspectâ Too busy up in heaven to think of earth. There 's Oliver;âI'll give him food for doubts, Which, if he breathe, I, through the influence Wielded by me above his heaven-rapt lord, Will drive the beggar forth. O, friendship dear, Through thee I'll work, and gain my end at last. (Enter Soto.) Soto. I have been looking for you far and near. I 've all the castle's secrets on my thumb. Don L. What know you, Soto? Soto. Nay, what know I not? I know, my lord, all that one girl could say In scarce an hour; but what would pose ten men, And they fast talkers, in a day to tell. Don L. Who gossiped thus? Soto. Martina. Don L. Who is she? Soto. The confidential maiden of my lady; A girl of wit, and most complete in form, With thoughts and aims above the place she holds. She, too, abhors the crafty secretary; And when I told her how I scorned the wretch, She loosed her eager tongue, told everything Which she had gathered since she first came here. At last we fell in love, and there we rest. Don L. Go on, good Soto, cram her to the brim, Love her as you have never loved before; Or rather make her love you, that were best. I too have fallen in love. Soto. With whom, my lord? Don L. With DoÃ±a Alda. Soto. Are you much in love? Don L. In love to death! Soto. O, that is nothing strange. You 've sickened for a score, died for a score; Till the next passion brought you health and life. There was Constanza, Clara, Viola, Maria, Isabella, Phillipaâ Don L. Peace! you are crying this she-merchandise As tradesmen do their wares. I tell you, knave, The love which now I feel gnaws me like hunger! Soto. They feed too well to give that figure force In this fat castle. But a week ago, When I was thin and famished in Seville, Such words had drawn forth tears of sympathy. But there 's the husband loves you 'bove all heights. Don L. And here am I, that hate him 'neath all depths. Soto. Natural enough; you bear it in your blood. I lately heard a ballad, ages oldâ A scurvy balladâa foul, lying balladâ Which told how some great ancestor of his Drove round Granada's laughter-shaken walls Kinsman of yours. Not with a manly swordâ No, that were fairâwith a base scourge he did it. Don L. What mean you? Soto. He 's of Moorish blood. Don L. You fool! Soto. Witness his Moorish name, Calaynos. Don L. True. Who told you this? Soto. Martina told me, seÃ±or. 'T is a mere taint he bears paternally: Though very slight, yet, in the pious eyes Of the hidalgos of Castilian breed, Worse than all crimes the devil ever did. 'T is a grave secret, not to be divulged. Don L. Ah, now I think, I heard it when a boy. What of his ladyâis she Moorish too? Soto. No, of the purest blood. Don L. Why, this is strange! Soto. Her sire was proud, but sunk in poverty; The lord was rich, but of the unclean blood-; And so they compromised, and struck a trade. Don L. Then the Moor bought her? Soto. So Martina says. That 's why he would not take her to Seville, For fear she 'd learn what half of Spain well knows. Don L. You 're sure she knows it not? Soto. Who 'd dare to tell? He 'd pitch the bold informer in the moat, To drink his health: he 's more than sovereign here. Don L. Now, lovely Alda, I have hold on thee, Shall draw thee to me, should all else fall short. [Aside.] Go, Soto, tell this new-made love of yours That I'm neck-deep in love for her fair lady. You need not tell her to be secret.âGo! Soto. Here 's mischief brewing. (Aside.) I obey you, seÃ±or. [Exit.] Don L. Thanks, love! This news outgoes my wildest hope. I doubt no more, the thing is certainty; The chase is simple, and the conquest sure. Sure 't is a virtuous deed to set her right; To show this cozening Moor in all his guilt, In all the blackness of his foul deceit, To her dear eyes.âGood Lord! a boy might triumph! Woe, woe, Calaynos! this sole crime of thine Shall draw upon thy head a double grief! [Exit.] SCENE VI. A Room in the Castle. Enter Martina and Soto. Soto. There bloom twin rose-buds 'twixt your nose and chin, That I 'd fain taste. Martina. Kind sir, beware the thorns! [Showing her nails.] Soto. I 've felt the thorns, they rankle in my heart; Naught but thy lips can draw their venom out. [Kisses her.] Mar. Your act has bruised the heel of your desire, So close it treads behind.âDost love me, sir? Soto. Love thee! I love thee past the flight of thought. Words cannot tell theeânay, I cannot think, I cannot truly to myself conceiveâ Cannot set bounds to, cannot understand The one idea which o'er me reigns supreme, And bows me at thy feetâ(Kneels.) I can but feel The might of that strong spirit.âUseless words! [Rises.] I see thou hat'st me, see thou think'st me madâ Know thou wilt scorn meâsend me from thee far, To spend my days in mortified despair. O, what a dolt was I, to tell thee this! But my full heart drove on my silly tongue. Farewell, forever! Mar. Stay; I hate thee not. Soto. But dost thou love me? Say that word, or Iâ Mar. I love thee. Soto. Wilt thou ever love me thus? Mar. Till soul and body fall apart, I will. Soto. O joy, O love! Success beyond my hopes! I, like a reckless gamester, staked my all On this last throw, and, see, the game is won! Mar. Play not again; or you may lose your winnings. Soto. Fear not, dear maid; I'm rich in what I 've won. But dost thou know, Martina, that we two Are not the only lovers here? Mar. How so? Soto. My lord thy lady loves, as I love thee, And she must love my master, as thou lov'st; Or we this dismal house can never fly; Here he'll abide till doomsday.âDost thou see? We must contrive to win her to his love? For, if she fly, then in her train fly we. Mar. She loves him not; yet may be brought to it.â I'll do my utmost; for thy sake, not his. Soto. Where dost thou lodge? Mar. Just next my lady's room, And Hymen keeps the key.âFair sir, good-night! [Exit.] Soto. She 's a brave wench; but somewhat over-prudent.â Well, if I wed her, I'll not mate a fool. Now to Don Luis; let him watch his game, If he will play at hazard with the Moor: There'll be swords drawn before this cast is o'er. [Exit.] ACT IV. SCENE I. The Great Hall in the Castle. Enter Don Luis and Soto. Don Luis. Yet I much doubt the power Martina holds. In small affairs her influence may be great; But in a matter like the one now toward, I fear she must come off with sorry grace. I value virtue, though I have it not, And know its power to set all wiles at naught; Heart-rooted good may pass through fire unscathed, And chastity can keep a fiend at bay, With its pure, sinless front. Soto. Bravo, my lord! Here 's a fine speech, to come from one like you! Don L. Soto, I 've trod all paths of sin and guilt, And know the wickedness and crimes of men; Yet would have been a fool, had I not seen That virtue may exist, though rare indeed. I tell you, I have met it everywhere, In halls and hovels; and have oft retired, Abashed and conquered, from its injured look. Soto. My lord, if thus you reason 'gainst yourself, As if persuading form your first design, Give up the chase: I'll never counsel guilt. Don L. No, by the gods! you misconceive my aim. Fools come to naught, who follow cheating hope; I ever look at the dark side of things, And weigh the chances 'gainst my own success: So bring to enterprise a wary eye, Prepared for every stop that balks my way. Naught but long-suffering good, that triumphs most When most oppressed by adverse circumstance, Can 'scape the snares that threaten Alda's feet. Soto. Martina calls her weak, of fickle mind, Curious for change, and discontented here; Unstable in design, thence easily led. Don L. She may be thus, and yet be pure as heaven. Soto. Monstrous, my lord! Do you not blush with shame, To look on virtue, and dissect it thus? If I e'er thought of good I 'd turn a monk. Don L. You say Martina knows no ill of her, No sin, the slightestânot a hook or loop, Whereby to lead her on? Mayhap her lord Has told his Moorish birth, in some soft mood,â Has reconciled the stain, and won regard. Soto. Martina gives but one reply to that; She says her lady never had a hint Of how Calaynos wronged her;ârest on this. Don L. 'T is well, 't is well; the sharper then the stroke, The keener then the pang, the more she loves.â Nay, nay, she loves him notâto that I'll swear; But this will tear respect and awe away. Martina must contrive we meet to-night; And you stand ready at the horses' heads. If you would take your baggage, have her prompt, And pack her safe upon another horse; While you ride guard, to hinder all pursuit: My steed bears double.âSee, the lady comes. (Enter DoÃ±a Alda and Martina. Soto and Martina talk apart.) Lady, I waited to address you here. I on the morrow for Seville depart. DoÃ±a Alda. So soon! Calaynos knows not your intent? Don L. Not yet. An urgent matter calls me off. But ere I goâif, lady, you'll permitâ Some words, deep freighted with your happiness, Must claim a notice. DoÃ±a A. Speak, sirâI attend. Don L. Not now; to-night, if you will meet me here. DoÃ±a A. Speak now: why wait till night? Don L. Nay, bring your maid; Let her remain in ear-shot, should you call. I mean no wrong; I fain would do you right. DoÃ±a A. Sir, on such terms, I grant what you request. Don L. Adieu, till thenâpoor lady! [Exeunt Don Luis and Soto.] DoÃ±a A. What means he? âPoor lady!ââThis is strange beyond a dream. Why does he pity meâwhy look so sad, With so much pain and trouble on his brow; As if he bore a load of secret woe, That must have birth with many a fearful pang? I'll seek Calaynos, and entreat adviceâ No, no, 't will vex him. Sure he means no wrong For full-eyed pity never troops with guilt. Martina, did you mark Don Luis' plight?â How quick he left, as if to save me pain? Martina. He seemed dejected, and o'ercome with grief. DoÃ±a A. Can you conjecture aught? Mar. Not much, nor clearly. DoÃ±a A. What do you think? Mar. I think he is in love. DoÃ±a A. Pshaw! that 's the offspring of two silly headsâ Soto and you are ridden to death with fanciesâ He is too wise to love without a hope. Men who have known the world as long as he, But fall in love with great estates or goldâ Taking the encumbrant maiden as an ill; And not with peril, such as he must brook Who dares to love the wife of great Calaynos. Mar. Yet such things have been. DoÃ±a A. O, yes; sung in ballads. Mar. Ay, and in real life, lady: Queens of Spain Have had their paramours. DoÃ±a A. So might it be, Yet never hap to bride of a Calaynos. No, no; some solemn mystery bore him down, Which he must tell, though he 'd fain shun the act. Mar. What mystery deeper than an untold love? What keener pang than telling in despair? Find me a grief, to rend a loving heart, More cruel than separation without hope! Believe me, lady, this is root of all. DoÃ±a A. Ha! think you so?âWhy, then, I meet him not. I'll not put torture to his tongueless love; I will not tempt him to dare certain death, For the poor consolation words afford. Mar. I may be wrongâperchance I may be wrongâ Nay, now I think, I cannot but be wrong. He would conceal his love from outward show Till the last momentâI am sure I'm wrong: Yet am I sure he loves you, though he go Without a sign to show the love he feels. DoÃ±a A. I will not hate him for the love he bears; Nor will I fan my secret vanity With his despairing sighs, as women do: No man can say whom he will love, whom hateâ The act o'erleaps his will; and a pure heart, That burns to ashes, yet conceals its pain, For fear it mar its hopeless source of love, Is not to be despised, nor lightly held. Mar. You are too cruel, to gain and not return. DoÃ±a A. I am too just to soil Calaynos' honor. Mar. I never thought of him. DoÃ±a A. Ne'er thought of him! My chiefest spring and stimulant of good, Before whose face crime takes an humble guise, And blushes at its meannessânever thought! Mar. My love for you admits no rival cares. DoÃ±a A. And can you separate my lord from me?â What bears on him, has double weight for me. Did I not think this coming interview, Through me, held things of moment to my lord, I ne'er had granted it; for he shall hear, Ere I have time for thought, the substance of it. Mar. 'T is but time lost:âI will not urge her more, Lest I disgust her with my Soto's lord. She ever flies from Luis to Calaynos; And when I name the Don, she bends her thoughts Full on her lord, and speaks of him alone. Her admiration has nigh grown to love. Luis must plead to-nightâpray heaven he win! [Aside.] DoÃ±a A. What are you muttering, girl? Mar. I hummed a tune, Of a poor squire who loved a noble lady. DoÃ±a A. Heaven grant the lady was a maid, not wife! Mar. I cannot tell.âWhen comes this interview? DoÃ±a A. What hour?âO, I forgot.âHe named no hour. Mar. Well, say at two. DoÃ±a A. But that is very late. Mar. The better; for no listeners will be near. That base-born cur, that prying Oliver, Roams o'er the house, like a flushed hound on scent.â I wonder what the villain would nose out? He counts us all, but his dear lord, as game. I vow, I have no peace: at every door, Through every glass, I see his ugly face. DoÃ±a A. He is, you know Calaynos' Mercury; Who, through him, watches that his guest is served. Mar. Well, then, I'll say at two. [Exit hastily.] DoÃ±a A. Stay, stay, Martina!â She hears me not. One hour is as another; 'T will be no darker when two strikes than nine. I would not trust this man at such a time, Having suspicion that he bears me love, Did I not hear his virtues told to me, From morn till eve, by my most thoughtful lord. If I should ask Calaynos, he 'd sayâGo; There is no fear where good Don Luis comes. Trust him, my child; for he is honor's soul! Well, well, I'll goâI marvel what it bodes! [Exit.] SCENE II. The Study of Calaynos. Calaynos and Oliver. Oliver. When does Don Luis leave? Calaynos. Not soon, I hope. His visit here has brought the color back To his wan cheek, and lent a healthy cast To thoughts that sickened o'er his former woes. We surely may predict much good of him, When he returns to mingle with mankind: He will not rust in ease; he'll speak and act, And do the utmost God has given him power. Ah, he who rests in sloth bears half the guilt Of him who goes about to compass ill; For heaven has lent him strength to conquer sin, Which, through disuse, lets evil run unchecked. He who has power to plant one seed of truth, And does it not, is nigh as bad as he Who, with broad hand, sows falsehood through the land. Oli. I hope with you; and yet I fear, my lord. Cal. Fear what? Speak out.âAgain at your suspicions! Oli. I have received some letters from Seville, Which place your guest in no too virtuous light. They sayâ Cal. Before you speak, pray answer me.â From whom this news, and how was it obtained? I said you 'd surfeit doubt, if food you sought; And here is proof.âGo on; whence came this news? Oli. From a fast friend, who loves you as my master: A man whom anxious guilt would ne'er suspect Of saying aught beyond the pale of truth. He gained intelligence from public rumorâ Why, it is broad and common as the sun; But chiefly from those very creditors Who got your gold, and then enjoyed the trick. Cal. And shall I doubt my friend for knaves so base, Who thus avow they practised villany? Did he not tell me of the cunning traps In which they snared him, in which now you fall? If they 're so lost to shame, as to confess That through a trick they wronged my confidence, How shall I now believe, though seeming true, The tangled tale they blush not to unfold? Oli. Nay, sir, if you fling logic in my teeth, And reason facts to falsehoods, I have done. Cal. Can you not mask your thoughts, if they offend? Oli. Next God comes truth, and in that rank I love it! Cal. Sir, I have borne unmurmuring, day by day, Your wily hints, though wounded to the quick.â I have been vexed by your sly, boyish tricks, That sought to lead a man of twice your years: I told you once before, I tell you now, That guilty cunning which preys on itself, Content with proof would make a sophist stare, You have mistaken for wisdom.âLeave me, sirâ To-morrow I shall want a secretary. Oli. Good heaven! my lord, you would not cast me off? You would not thrust me on this evil world?â Cal. You will see all the traps, shun all the snares, And prosper bravely, as the wily do.â Nay, now I think, I have another house Beyond the mountains, out of sight and hearing: Go there and dwellâthe pension is the same. Oli. Spare me, my lord! Be just, if you are cruel; Nor taunt me with the pay I never sought. Have I loved gold, or have I hoarded it?â Where is the wealth you gave in my command? If I must go, I go without a coin, Whose yellow look might curse me with its shame! Cal. I never knew in you a sordid wish. Oli. O, no! O, no! you knew me from a child; I sat upon your knee, and called you father; Played with your tasselled swordâah, then you smiled, And kissed my forehead, for that tender name.â Our cheeks were touching, when you taught me letters; O, you were patient then, nor roughly chid Your stammering scholar if he spelled awry. You did not taunt me with a love of gold; You did not stand upon your awful power, And tell your nursling to go forth and die! Ah, no; you told me e'er to love you thus; And for that lesson I am wrecked at last! Cal. Poor boy! poor boy! Nay, then remainâ Oli. Not I! I 'd rather starve than eat unwelcome bread.â That, too, you taught me, and I thank you, sir. I value freedom o'er all else besides; Nor would I be dependent for a throne. To-morrow you'll be happyâI'll be free. Cal. No, no; it shall not be. Come here, my sonâ Come close to meâI am again your father; Nor shall e'en friendship sunder time-knit love. Oli. Your blessing, sir,â't will lighten many a toil. Cal. Are you resolved? Oli. Ay, though my heart-strings snap! Cal. God bless you, son! Oli. God keep you from the snares! Cal. Away, away! lest you revoke my blessing. [Exit Oliver.] He does as I would do. O, stiff-necked pride! That chokes each avenue to humble loveâ That walls the glowing heart with stubborn ice, And leaves the beds of feeling cold and dry! Farewell! The first bright link is torn away; Thus time will rend the reliques one by one. [Exit.] SCENE III. The Great Hall in the Castle. Enter DoÃ±a Alda and Martina DoÃ±a Alda. Has it struck two? Martina. 'T is near that hour, my lady. DoÃ±a A. Before or after? Mar. Just before, my lady. DoÃ±a A. We are too soon.âThe clock is surely wrong. Mar. 'T is natural haste. He knows a woman well. DoÃ±a A. Yes, yes; a woman never waits for ill; We always meet it.âDid you hear a step? Mar. Not I.âDid you? DoÃ±a A. Perhaps it was my heart. That beats so painfully against my side. Would it were over! (Clock strikes.) Hark! there strikes the clock; It sounds as if 't would wake the castle up.â Did you e'er note before how loud it strikes? This is not rightâI feel it is not right. I'll leave the hall.âSee, how those portraits frown! As if I 'd done some crime, or were about it. Mar. You are too lateâlook, where Don Luis comes! He means no wrong.âNay, lady, I'll be near. DoÃ±a A. Sure never evil wore so smooth a face. (Enter Don Luis. Martina retires within.) Don Luis. Your prompt attention chides my lingering steps. DoÃ±a A. Speak quickly, sir: I have short time to hear. Don L. What, without more delay? DoÃ±a A. Right to the purpose. Don L. O, then prepare your ears to hear a tale Shall shake your soul, and task your tottering mind To bear its feeble body firmly up. DoÃ±a A. With such dread prelude, what must I expect? Don L. First, lest it seem 'gainst nature, or to prove That I am quite devoid of gratitude Towards him whose kindness I have felt, and feel, Know the full cause which prompts me to the deed. Know 't is to see you righted, who are wrongedâ Wronged in a way that most concerns your honorâ Wronged by a wretch in whom you have most trust; But to be righted by a man who loves. Yes, yes, I love youâlove you with a heart That ne'er before knew love for womankind. But yet I love you purely as a saint: I dare but worship, hope not to approach; I have not thought to win a smile or sign: I bow in homage; sacrifice a heart, Though torn and bleeding, spotless as your own. Nay, more, I pray to have my love forgiven, Whose adoration may offend your eyes; For oft devout and reverend worship seems, In others' sight, no purer than foul sin. Yet must I tell my love; my dammed up heart At length has swept each choking fear away, And caused a flood in which, perchance, I'll drown. O, spare me, lady!âsay you can forgive! DoÃ±a A. Audacious man, dare you overleap the brink, Nor know the fearful depth that yawns below? Have you e'er looked from yonder window's edge, Down on the grisly rocks that jut beneath, Ragged and cruel as the chafed boar's fell tusks? Have you e'er turned your dizzy eyes aloft, To view the tower which hangs above those crags? On that same tower, years since, a malpert page Sighed forth his love to our great-grandsire's daughter; Next day they found him on the rocks below, Mangled and dead.âSome said he slipped and fell; But none knew how, or why.âBeware, fair sir, If not sure-footed, how you walk that tower! Don L. Alas, alas! this is a woful tale, That one should fall for love!âYou pity him? DoÃ±a A. Not for his love he fell, but telling it: There was the crime that caused his grievous slip. Better his fire of love had burned to dust, Than roused up sleeping justice with its blaze. Don L. Have you no feeling for a burning heart, That cannot quench its fire, except in death? DoÃ±a A. âSuffer in silenceâ is the legend graven Beneath the shield that crowns our castle gate: When you came here you passed beneath that shield, Yet have not read the wisdom it contains. Don L. Sweet lady, hear me. DoÃ±a A. Nay, no more of love. Another word, I'll call Calaynos forth.â Martina, are you there? Martina. (ReÃ«ntering.) I am, my lady. Don L. Fool! get you gone. [Exit Martina.] DoÃ±a A. Ha! dare you go?âCome back! Good-night, good-night; I have o'erstaid my time.â Sir, thank your gentle bearing for your safety. [Going.] Don L. Lady, return; you have not heard me out: This is but prologue to the tragedy; Now comes the guilty tale of which I spoke DoÃ±a A. Nay, there was guilt enough in what you said: Tax not my ears to bear a weightier load.â Farewell. [Going.] Don L. And you are lostâforever lost! O, I beseech you listen, on your life! DoÃ±a A. ProceedâI'll hear; but not a word of love. Don L. No, 't is of hate, of most malicious hateâ Hate self-engendered, without cause or motiveâ Against you borne by one you dearly trust; Shown in the heavy wrong 'neath which you live, Though all unweeting that such crime exists. DoÃ±a A. Who does me wrong?âOne whom I love and trust? Martina? Don L. No; strike nearer to yourself. DoÃ±a A. Then Oliver; for he is next my lord. Don L. Your lord himself. DoÃ±a A. 'T is false! 't is false as sin! I will not waste a moment on a lie.â Get hence, you scurvy thing, base hypocrite, That thus would stab your benefactor's back!â You dare not face him, coward, and say this, Lest he should whip you with his undrawn sword! Get hence! 't was fit you should crawl forth at night, If you must spit your pent-up venom forth; But keep your slimy poison from my ear, Or I may crush you, toad! Don L. Be calm, and hear. DoÃ±a A. Be mad, and rave! I might forgive you then. Don L. I tell you, mortal ne'er such wrong enduredâ DoÃ±a A. As you dare fling upon me. Don L. Hear me out.â Who do you think your lord, Calaynos, is? DoÃ±a A. The noblest, greatest, wisest man in Spain! Don L. I tell you, lady, he is one half Moor; His other half holds every baseness in it, That spots the nature of the lowest white. DoÃ±a A. A Moor, a Moorâa lie! Don L. His name, his name! Is it not Moorish, from the first to last?â 'T is sung of in our ballads. DoÃ±a A. Gracious Heaven! I never thought of thatâI never thoughtâ Don L. Look at these portraits, dark by blood, not age, Clad in the Moorish steel from crest to heel.â Thus scowled they on the ranks of Ferdinand, When they mowed down the brightest flowers of Spain; Thus proudly looked they, thus they him defied, When round these walls his leaguering armies lay; Thus grimly smiled they, when the baffled king Was forced to grant them lands he could not hold. Why, are you purblind, that you see them not, These dusky founders of his powerful house? DoÃ±a A. It cannot be; my father then had knownâ Don L. Yes, he was poor, and sold you like a slaveâ A precious, fair-skinned slave, to sate a Moor! You, you, the brightest jewel in all Spain, Became a thing to fill a miser's chests:â Why, he 'd have bartered with the devil for you! Would you have proof?âI'll bring a crowd of it. This why Calaynos kept you from Sevilleâ This cause of the secluded life you lead; Forbid to mingle in the joys of life, To wrap his damned, black mystery closer up! DoÃ±a A. O, misery, despair! Where shall I turn? Don L. Turn to me, dearest, I will succor you. DoÃ±a A. Avaunt! you child of hell, you torturer! Foul, tempting fiend, through you I thus have fallen. Why came you here, to mar my paradise With knowledge proffered by the hand of crime? Don L. O, then return; go to your darling's bed; Crawl to his side, and kiss his thick-lipped mouth; Play with his curly pate, and call him fair; Pray heaven to bless you with a hybrid race! O, hug him close, close as fools clasp a sin, And dream you 're happy; that were wise and kind. If you have woman's spirit, bear it not! DoÃ±a A. O, foulâO, foul! and they to do this thingâ Father and husband!âO, my heart will burst! Don L. I tell you, you were cheated by this Moor, Lied to and cozened, made a merchandise, Sold to the highest bidderâhe bid high. Now he might sell you to some other hand, If he could get a profit on his ware.â What worse than this? What worse can come than this?â Ah, you have breathed deceit, and fed on guilt; Thought him a saint, who was at heart a fiend. Poor child, poor child! now could I weep for you; But anger chokes the kindlier channels up, With thinking on this base, heart-cheating Moor.â DoÃ±a A. Spare me!âCalaynosâ [She faints.] Don L. But one way remains. Now nerve me, love, to bear my precious freight. [He carries her off.] (After a pause, enter Calaynos.) Calaynos. Methought I heard a voice repeat my name; And then a hurried rush of trampling feet. No, 't was a fancy; all is still.âThese lightsâ Why burn they here, at this unwonted hour, Watching, like grief, the dull, cold midnight through? This is a strange neglect, unknown before, And dangerous. I must draw a tighter rein. These knavish servantsâHa! I heard a noise, [Opens the casement.] Like the dull sound a flying courser makes, When urged to speed along the yielding sod. Some of the deer have broken through the pale, And gambol nimbly 'neath the winking stars. Bright nightly watchers, tell your secrets now; Unfold to me the mystery of your being; Say why ye came, how long ye thus have kept Your faithful vigils o'er this atom, earth! Were you but formed for man to gaze upon, To flatter him, and puff his spirit up; Or in creation's scale do ye hold place Of more import than sages ever dreamed? Ye misty pleiads, where has gone the star That, ages since, among ye disappeared? How men with wild conjectures vex their minds, To find what cause could blot that fiery orb! Yet if a brother mortal leave his sphere, From this vast human firmament struck out, They pass the lifeless clay without a thought Of why he left, or where his elements. Pale, dusty path, that, in the depths of space, Hangs like a smoky track behind the wheel Of some vast burning orb; but, to the sage, Resolves to starry pebbles paving heavenâ Nay, to great suns, to satellites, to systems, In myriad numbers whirling on through spaceâ O, what is far beyond you? Can ye see The limit that hems in the universe? O, what remains hid from the prying glass, Whose added strength looks still on other worlds? Yet with this awful knowledge, impious manâ Ah, yes, the meanest of the clay-born herdâ Will strut and vapor, as if he alone Filled the whole universe, and gave it laws. Lo! meek-eyed morn, like a pale beggar, knocks With trembling fingers at night's eastern gate. Poor Oliver, this morn is black to thee! I must retire. (Knocking.) What can that knocking mean?â Where are the sluggish knaves that tend the gate? [Bell rings.] Ho, Oliver, come forth! (Enter a Servant.) Quick, ope the gate! [Exit Servant.] This early summons bodes some weighty matter. (Enter Oliver.) Oliver. My lord, you called? Cal. Nay, get to sleep again. I know not why I calledâ't was habitâgo. Oli. You know full well I did not sleep last night.â 'T is useless to attempt it. (Enter a Forester wounded.) Cal. Who are you, That startle morning ere the cock has crowed? Wounded and bleeding! If I see aright, You wear the livery of my foresters. Forester. My wound is nothing; but the way it came May much concern your lordship, if you'll hear. Cal. Say on. For. Well, seÃ±or, as I went my rounds, Just ere the break of day, to watch the herd, I saw two horsemen spurring to the blood Across the park, as if to gain the hills. The foremost bore a lady in his arms, Who seemed nigh dead with fear, or dead outright: Well, this one passed ere I could cross his way. Beside the second rode a girl I 'd seenâ My lady's maid, I think her name 's Martina; But who the man was I can scarcely tell. Well, sir, I threw my staff across his path, And bade him stand: out came his heavy sword; With a side blow he struck me down to earth, And split my skull with this unmanly wound. The coward! If I 'd had a sword, my lord, I warrant you I 'd make the fellow leap. But then you see I was unarmed, my lord, And it was nearly dark. I stood just so, With my staff raisedâ Cal. I thank you for your pains. Here 's gold, to heal your wound. [Offers money.] For. I 'd rather not: The chance to serve you has been pay enough. [Exit.] Cal. There goes a man, a man without a price, Who takes no fee for virtue! Oliver. Oli. My lord. Cal. What think you of this fellow's tale? Soto has done us service, were it not That her elopement will sore vex my lady. Oli. But who the foremost horseman?âwhom bore he? Cal. That 's strange indeed. Go call Don Luis up. [Exit Oliver, hastily.] Here is brisk gossip for a week or two: There'll be no grumblers here till this is o'er. I, too, am rid of one whose wanton breath Forced into birth my lady's discontent, To choke her peace with its unhealthy sprouts. (ReÃ«nter Oliver.) Oli. Don Luis, sir, ne'er saw his couch last night; And all his lighter luggage is removed. Cal. Call DoÃ±a Alda. Oli. Sir, I passed her room; The door was open, not a soul within. Cal. What can this mean?âWhy bite your trembling lip, And bend your eyes so sharply on my face? Oli. Ah, what sad prophets may our fears become! Cal. What do you mean? Oli. My lord, I dare not say. Cal. 'T will not offendâspeak out. Oli. You promise me? Cal. I vow, I will not say or do you ill. Oli. The foremost horsemanâwho was he? Cal. Go on. Oli. Don Luis. Cal. Ha! the lady whom he bore Wasâ Oli. Pardon me, for she was DoÃ±a Alda. Cal. Monstrous! And wags the tongue that dare say this? Oli. 'T is true, my lord, or rend me limb from limb. Cal. Rash boy, I will be calmâcalm as the storm, Ere on your head its gathering terrors burst! (Enter a Servant.) Servant. My lord, some laboring men beset the gate, Who beg to see you; for they boldly say That, as they went to work, they saw a man, Mounted and armed like a stout cavalier, Flying with Lady Alda in his arms. On foot they could not reach himâ Cal. Out! begone! [Exit Servant.] These torturing fiends are leagued to drive me mad! Oli. My lord, my lord! Cal. Why stand you there, dull sloth, And stare upon me with your vacant eyes? Slay wench and paramour.âMount, mount, and follow! (Oliver snatches a sword from the wall.) Ha! the hot blood of all the Moors is up, And must have blood to lay it.âMount, I say!â You'll not desert me now? Oli. Not while my soul Clings to its wretched clay.âShall I slay both? Cal. Slay both; without a thought of mercy slay! The shallow fools have fallen in love with death. Oli. Murder will blot my soul when I return. Cal. The murder of two wolves that tore your lord! Oli. Mine to obey;âI question not your mandates. Cal. Stay, Oliver; their blood must be on me. Oli. No, no; I 'd rather do it. Cal. O God, forgiveâ Forgive my impious rage! Withhold thy frown, Till I have sifted, to the very dust, This hideous matter! Follow, but slay not. Disguise your form, and seem not what you areâ The more like them who hid their acts as thieves. Learn all you can, and then return to me: Slow justice is more certain of its end. If she repent, and you are moved to pity, And dare to bring her where I catch a glimpse Of her repentant features, by the gods, I'll hurl you from the walls!âBe still, my heart! [Aside.] Oli. I will obey in all. Cal. Away, away! [Exit Oliver.] Where shall I turn? O, what thing shall I do? How have I scorned the men of ancient Rome, Who left their fortunes to a flying bird! But, now, I 'd hang my doubts upon a die, Or whirling coin, and follow it like fate. O, vain philosophy! is this thy aid? When troubles darken, and the passions rage, Must the philosopher become a manâ A feeble man, a very fool of impulse? 'T is all in vain, I cannot drive my thoughts Into their wonted channels; cannot weigh, Nor calmly speculate upon my grief. O, Alda, Alda, thoughts of thee come back, And drive all speculation from my brain!â Why here am I, who thought to will to do, Who thought I 'd schooled my passion as a child, Raving at heaven o'er one of life's poor wrongs! How brave, how brave in me to teach long suffering, And, when I suffer, shrink without a tug! O, Alda, Alda, never love thee more, Never behold thee, never call thee mine!â I have a heart that mocks philosophy; Burst forth, my heartâI'm but a man at last! [Weeps.] ACT V. SCENE I. The Great Hall in Calaynos' Castle. Enter Calaynos. Calaynos. The strife is vain; I cannot think nor read; My mind will wander, and my eyes grow dim: She clings to me like sin! I catch myself, Involuntary, dreaming o'er the page, And all my dream of her. Day follows day, Yet deeper sinks the barb. Each hour my heart, Like a calmed vessel next a hideous rock, Heaves near this one idea. I hear her name Breathed by the air, in every gale that blows; I feel her hand upon my shoulder laid, And sigh that sense can cheat. O shame, shame, shame! Thy slime clings round me, and doth drag me down. O pride, O o'erblown pride, on which I swam In life's calm seas, and gayly smiled at fate;â Thou, in the tempest's hour, dost toss me up, On the dread top of every howling wave, To send me thundering in its black abyss!â Better beneath the choking brine to sink, And die untortured. Why did she deceive? Why do this damning act? If thunder roar, Men look above their heads, to find a cloud; But I am withered by a scathing shock, And yet the cause know not. What, Alda false? I'll not believe itâI am not awake; I'll wake, ere long, and find her by my side; Or she'll return, and tell it all to me. It is a trick to try me. She is hid, In some odd nook, to watch her jealous lord; Next thing she'll sally out, and mock my grief.â She false! I 'd staked my soul upon her truth. Ah, 't is a trick, a trickâa trick to damn! What shall I do? Who shall direct me now? (Turns to the portraits.) I dare not question you, ye men of blood; I know your answerâdraw the sword and kill! Fling out our banner, fire the culverins, Call in the war-bred from their ancient hills, And let the trembling valleys hear, aghast, Calaynos wars with man! O, empty threat! Blood cannot heal the scars which seam my heart. (Opens the casement.) The very sky is red,âis red as blood! Down, tempting devil, down!âI will not murder: 'T is the last print of evening 's fiery foot That burns in yonder clouds. Ere long, the night Shall fall as black as memory on my soulâ O heaven! without a hope to light my path, One starry hope, to lend its guiding beam. Stumbling, and lost in darkness, on I grope To deathâO yes, to deathâto peace and rest. What dusky clouds o'erclimb yon eastern peaks? A storm? Come on, I like thy looks, my mate! Shake thy red lightnings o'er this wicked worldâ Strike all the guilty with thy burning handâ Pour thy cruel hail upon their naked headsâ O'erturn their habitations, root them outâ Drive them, like sheep, before thy angry face! Nay, let them go: slay all the innocentâ Slay all the sufferers, all that ache 'neath wrongs; For guilt can live in peace, and smile at them! (Thunder.) Alda, awake! the God of heaven is out, The God of justice!âNo, the storm will pass; Or if it strike, perchance 't will kill a child. O, what a weary life is mineâstrike me, In mercy strike! (Enter Oliver.) Ha! thou 'st returned, my son? [Embraces him.] Didst thou seeâSpeak, I cannot question thee. Oliver. Yes, yes, I saw too much.âAlas! my lord, What dreadful thing has brought this change about? A month ago I left thee in thy prime, And, now, thou'rt old and wrinkled. Cal. Yes, my son, My heart is old and wrinkled as my brow. I have not long to live; I feel it here. Yet, ere I go, I fain would tidings gain Of DoÃ±a Alda.âIs she happy now? Oli. An hour ago, I passed a wretched town; But, ere I left, a squalid thing of rags Went by me, yet begged not; though I was clad, Painted, and bearded like a cavalier. I gave it, all unasked, it looked so sadâ That thing was Lady Alda. Cal. Base-born dog! And did you dare to give her charity? Oli. 'T was of your gold I gave. Cal. O, pardon me: The devil in my blood will not be laid. And did she take it with a courtly grace, Learned at Seville from her bewitching Don; Or did she clutch it like a common drab? Say on; I'm sorrow-proof. Oli. Ah, no, my lord; She hardly felt the gold touch her thin palm; And then she smiled, so sorrowful, so sweet, As one unused to kindness. Cal. Know'st thou more? I 'd steeled my heart to hear the blackest tale, But this doth blacken fancy. Oli. Few my words! Of her dark story much I could not gather; And what I gained I came at by report. She fled with thy false friend too well thou know'st; But why, is known to him and her alone. From some vague hints, I think the guilt not hers; But that Don Luis used the foulest means, And so achieved his wish most treacherously.â 'T is said, and I believe it. Cal. Bless thee, Heaven! Oli. She lived with him a while, but then she fled; This, too, a mystery;âthough I heard his knave, His vile familiar, Soto, said in scornâ âShe was too grand a lady for a mistress!â Since then, she wanders on from town to town, With death's fell signet stamped upon her brow, Looking like grief in animated stone. Cal. Yet the sun shines, and yet this villain lives! O, slow, slow justice, must I be thy tool? (Storm increases.) Oli. Mercy, how 't rains! Cal. Ay, ay, alike on all. Dost think poor Alda feels this bitter storm, Homeless and friendless, without cloak or food? Oli. Perchanceâ(A groan without.) Hark, hark! Cal. Methought I heard a sound, Like the weak moan of a sick, restless child. [Another groan.] Oli. And there again! It comes from 'neath yon window. Cal. Look out and see. Oli. (Looking out.) I saw, by the last flash, A huddled form that cowered against the wall. Perchance some helpless child has lost its way, And cannot find the gate. Cal. Go bring it in: No beast should suffer on a night like this. [Exit Oliver.] (Goes to the casement.) Ay, shake your fiery tresses, dusky clouds; I have resolvedâye cannot move my mind! Ye'll spare me for this actâye love a crime; Or long ago ye 'd scathed that viper's skinâ Three days from this he dies, and by my hand. (Thunder.) Roar on, roar on! I'll plunge my arm in blood Up to the elbowâhe shall bellow too! Poor Alda, whither roamest thou, sad wretch, Without a home or comfort!âSpare her, Heaven! For thou canst soften tempests to a breath, To succor the shorn lambâO, she is shorn! (ReÃ«nter Oliver, with servants bearing DoÃ±a Alda on a couch.) Oli. She has not long to live:âI brought her here. Cal. Brought whom? Oli. The lady Alda. Cal. Gracious heaven! Why, I am passion's plaything.âShall I rave?â Shall I grow drunk on grief, and fire the house?â Or what most desperate and headlong act Hast Thou reserved for me? I'm readyâspeak! Say anything; but let me do, not think; For I with thought grow mad! Oli. Look on her, sir. Cal. I cannot. Oli. Look; more harmless thing ne'er lived. Ah, she is very still, and cold, and pale; Scarce a pulse flutters; she is nigh run down; The balance of her body hardly beats: Another move, then follows endless rest. Cal. Endless! Stand here; I'll look at her once more. (Approaches the couch.) Poor wretch, poor wretch! why, grief hath rubbed thee sore! I see its marks upon thy once smooth brow; And it has crept among thy tangled hair, To nestle in its silk. Sad mark of woe, I'll not believe thy guilt; 't was not thy fault; That villain Luis, by some hell-hatched lie, Drove thee past reason. Thou hast a tale, shut up Within the hollow chamber-of thy breast, To make avenging falchions bristle earth; Thou couldst urge stony death to mend his pace, And strike the monster ere his day.âShe moves. Go to her, Oliver; I cannot stay. Perchance, she 'd speak, yet has short time for words. DoÃ±a Alda. Calaynos. Oli. Hark! she calls thee, sir. Cal. Go, go! Oli. Lady, I'm here. DoÃ±a A. Nay, nay, deceive me not. I saw a pitying face bent over me, And it was his. Thou 'rt Oliver. O, sir, If thou hast trace of feeling in thy nature, Pray, bring him here. I'm weak, and ill, and fallen: He would not come for me; for he is proud, And I have wronged him to the depths of wrongâ Not all myself; but yet he thinks 't was I.â Go, ere I die, in mercy go, kind sir. Cal. (Rushing to her.) Alda! DoÃ±a A. Break, heart! I am content to die. Cal. O live! O live! I will forgive thee all.â I will heap kindness on thee, till its top Shall knock at heaven. We will be friends, true friends; If not my wife, thou shalt be dearer far.â If any here shall dare to mock at thee, I'll hang them from the walls to scare the wind.â I'll guard thee like a tiger! If the world Should choose to sneer, why, love, we'll laugh at it; Or, if thou lik'st, I'll ravage half of Spain.â Yes, I'll do anything; but live, O live! Far I can swear thou 'rt guiltless. Tell me all. DoÃ±a A. O god-like man! thy speech surpasses hope; I did not look for this from even thee; I only wished to crawl to thee and die: For I have shamed thee in the face of man. I 've made thy name a sneer and mockery; And fools may spit their slander on thy fame, To gall thy pride, and shake thy glorious mind. O fie, O fie! that I should do this actâ This act beneath pollution! Why not curse? Why not call vengeance on my head like rain? Why dost not spurn me? Why not cast me forth, To rot with kindred filth, in some foul place, Where my rank guilt may not offend thy sense? Cal. Alda! DoÃ±a A. It would be just. And I supposed, When I set forth to view thy face once more, That grooms would drive me from thy gates with whips; For well I knew my guilt deserved no less:â I sat in judgment on it, all alone, And that the fiat which my conscience gave. Cal. Speak not of this; thou dost o'erstrain thy guilt; Let me not doubt thee, in this solemn hour. Tell me thy story; for I think thee wronged. DoÃ±a A. Yes, foully wronged; but half the fault my own. There is a packet hidden in my breast, Which holds the truthful story of my crime; For thee 't was writ, ere I resolved to come. Thou 'lt spare the shame of telling thee this thing; 'T would bring a flush upon the face of death, And drive thee from thy firmness. When I'm dead, Tear forth the dreadful secret.âO, my lord!â Cal. What wouldst thou, Alda?âCheer thee, love!âbear up! DoÃ±a A. Thy face is dim; I cannot see thy eyes: Nay, hide them not; they are my guiding stars. Have sorrow's drops thus blotted out their light? Thou dost forgive me, love?âthou 'lt think of me?â Thou 'lt not speak harshly, when I'm neath the earth?â Thou 'lt love my memory, for what once I was? Cal. Yes, though I live till doom. DoÃ±a A. O, happiness! Come closerâthis thy hand? Have mercy, Heaven! Yes, press me closerâcloseâI do not feel.â Cal. O, God of mercy, spare! DoÃ±a A. A sunny dayâ O!â(She faints.) Cal. Bear her inâI am as calm as ice. Come when she wakes: I cannot see her thus. [Exeunt Oliver and servants, bearing DoÃ±a Alda.] 'T is better so; but then the thoughts come back Of the young bride I welcomed at the gate.â I kissed her, yes, I kissed herâwas it there? Yes, yes, I kissed her there, and in the chapelâ The dimly-lighted chapel.âI see it all! Here was old Hubert, there stood Oliverâ The priest, the bridesmaids, groomsmenâevery face; All the retainers that around us thronged, Smiling for joy, with ribands in their caps.â And shall they all, all follow her black pall, With weeping eyes, and doleful, sullen weeds? For they all love her:âO, she was so kind, So kind and gentle, when they stood in need; And never checked them if they murmured at her, But found excuses for their discontent.â They'll miss her, for her path was like an angel's, And every place seemed holier where she came. Ah me! ah me! I would this life were past! Stay, love, watch o'er me; I will join thee soon. (A cry within.) So quickly gone! and ere I said farewell! (Rushes to the door.) (ReÃ«nter Oliver.) Oli. My lordâ Cal. Yes, yes, she 's deadâI will go in. [Exit.] Oli. O, dreadful ending to a fearful night! This shock has shattered to the very root The strength of his great spirit. Mournful night! And what will day bring forth?âbut woe on woe. Ah, death may rest a while, and hold his hand, Having destroyed this wondrous paragon, And sapped a mind whose lightest thought was worth The concentrated being of a herd. Yet shall the villain live who wrought this woe? By heaven I swear, if my lord kill him not, I, though a scholar and unused to arms, Will hunt him downâay, should he course the earthâ And slay him like a felon! If this be sin, let fiends snap at my soul, But I will do it! Lo, where comes my lord, Bent down and withered, like a broken tree, Prostrate with too much bearing. (ReÃ«nter Calaynos.) Cal. Oliver, I stole to see her; not a soul was there, Save an old crone that hummed a doleful tune. And winked her purblind eyes, o'errun with tears. O, boy, I never knew I loved her so! I held my breath, and gazed into her faceâ Ah, she was wondrous fair. She seemed to me, Just as I 've often seen her, fast asleep, When from my studies cautiously I 've stolen, And bent above her, and drunk up her breath, Sweet as a sleeping infant's.âThen perchance, Yet in her sleep, her starry eyes would ope, To close again behind their fringy clouds, Ere I caught half their glory. There 's no breath now, There 's not a perfume on her withered lips, Her eyes ope not, nor ever will again.â But tell me how she died. She suffered not? Oli. She scarcely woke from her first fainting here; Or if she did, she gave no sign nor word. A while she muttered, as if lost in prayer; Some who stood close thought once they caught thy name; But grief had dulled my sense, I could not hear. Then she slid gently to a lethargy; And so she diedâwe knew not when she went. Cal. Here is the paper which contains her story: I fain would clear her name, fain think her wronged. [Reads.] O, double-dealing villain!âMoorâbought her! Impious monsterâfalse beyond belief! But she is guiltlessâhear'st thou, Oliver? Nay, read; I cannot move thee as she can. [Oliver reads.] He called me Moor. True, true, I did her wrong: The sin is mine; I should have told her that. I only kept it back to save her pain; I feared to lose respect by telling her. I see how he could heighten that grave wrong, And spur her nigh to madness with his taunts. She fell, was senseless, without life or reasonâ Why, tigers spare inanimated formsâ So bore her off. Then lie on lieâO base! The guilt all mine. Why did I hide my birth? Ah, who can tell how soon one seed of sin, Which we short-sighted mortals think destroyed, May sprout and bear, and shake its noxious fruit Upon our heads, when we ne'er dream of ill; For naught that is can ever pass away! Oli. And shall this villain live? Cal. No, no, by Heaven! Those fellows on the wall would haunt me then. I hear your voices, men of crime and blood, Ring in my ears, and I obey the call. [Snatches a sword from the wall.] How precious is the blade which justice wields, To chasten wrong, or set a wrong to right! [Draws.] Come forth, thou minister of bloody deeds, That blazed a comet in the van of war, Presaging death to man, and tears to earth! Pale, gleaming tempter, when I clutch thee thus, Thou, of thyself, dost plead that murder 's right, And mak'st me half believe it luxury! Thy horrid edge is thirsting for man's gore, And thou shalt drink it from the point to hilt!â To horse! to horse! the warrior blood is up; The tiger spirit of my warlike race Burns in my heart, and floods my kindling veins.â Mount, Oliver, ere pity's hand can hide The bloody mist that floats before my eyesâ To horse! to horse! the Moor rides forth to slay! [Exeunt.] SCENE II. A Street in Seville. Enter Don Miguel and Don Lopez, meeting. Don Lopez. Whither so fast, Miguel? Don Miguel. To join Don Luis And all his roaring fellows at a feast. Are you not going? For a modern feast, The thing will be as well as they know how. Would the old times might come to us again, When men drank sherry from a two-quart cup! Pshaw! if I had my way, I 'd turn time back. Now, if I drank at this same scurvy feast, As we of old could drink without a thought, The weak-brained boys would point their silly thumbs And ask their host if there the devil dined? Plague on these times! Give me the jolly days When men held mighty flagons in one hand, And with the other grasped their mightier swordsâ None of your toasting-forks; a true Toledo, Edged at each side, and pointed like a spear: Why, bah! these boys could scarcely lift such blades. Those were the glorious days of wine and war! Don Lop. May all you giants live to drink a tun; But pardon me about the rapier, sir. Don M. O yes, you'll talk of skill, and all that thing; But 't was more skill to 'scape a swashing blow, Than all your thrusts, and tierces, and such trash. Don Lop. What a cursed shame, to mince a man to deathâ To chop him into slices, break his bones, When a most gentle and well-mannered thrust Would do as wellâ Don M. To skewer him, like a fowl, To puncture him, to make him die of pin-stabs: 'T is like the death that poor Duns Scotus died, Slaughtered with pen-knives. Don Lop. Did you hear the news? Don M. Whatever 's new is worse than last. What is it? Don Lop. The great Calaynos is again in town. He came with such a pomp of retinue, With such barbaric wealth, such trains of menâ All clothed like Paynims of the ancient dayâ That wide-mouthed burghers thought Granada's peers Had scaled their graves, to fight for Spain once more. Don M. Ay, ay; what would your modern heroes do, If this were true, and all the Moors had risen; Headed by that Calaynos, who one day Rode post to France, to crop the Paladins, Just for mere love? They 'd drive you in the seaâ 'Sblood! but they 'd make you caper! Don Lop. This one, sir, Is greater far than he of ballad note: A braver man ne'er buckled on a blade; And then so generous and polite withal. Don M. You should have known his grandsire, as I did. His was a blade would tire your hip to bear, E'en in its baldric: and he swung it so! Just as a child would waft about a feather.â Here was a drinker for you.âBy the gods! A man like him can never come again; Earth is too base for such. Ah, he was slain, Stabbed by an upstart coward, o'er his wine. Don Lop. Methinks his drinking came to sorry ends. Don M. 'T was not his drink; 't was a cursed rapier, sir, Pinned him across the table.â'Sblood, my life! A manly blade had blushed at such an act. Adieu, sir; I must leave you.âPshaw! what times! [Exit.] Don Lop. Adieu, you drunken dotard! Who comes here? (Enter Calaynos.) My lord Calaynos, if I know your face? Calaynos. Don Lopezâam I right? Don Lop. Your servant, sir. Cal. Are you sincere? Don Lop. My heart cries shame on words. Cal. Then you can do me service 'bove all thanks. There is a man who wronged me in Seville, And I would kill him. Do you understand? Don Lop. Write out the cartelâ't is a pleasure, sir. Cal. That have I done long since; an hour ago I sent it by my secretary. Don Lop. Heavens! My lord, that act is out of every form: I wash my hands of this; 't is next to murder. Cal. Friend, fear not that; you can escape the law. Last night I made my will, and there I left, To whom might be my second, gold enough To build yon palace. 'T is but just I shield Him whom my deeds involve. What say you, sir? Don Lop. Nay, for the love I bear you, I will do it. How ran the challenge? Cal. What can that import? Defiance to the death ran through each word. Don Lop. Such savage terms are out of date and harsh. Now, I 'd have written a most gentle billetâ AsâSeÃ±or So-and-so requests the length Of my lord So-and-so's best tempered blade; Or any hint, polite and delicate, Like that. Believe me, sir, a gentleman May show much blood in wording of a challenge. Cal. So I must bow my opposite to death, Must kill by line and plummet, to 'scape blame.â Sir, I'm above polite hypocrisy. Don Lop. Well, as you please. What is your rapier's length? Cal. Here is my sword. [Gives his sword.] Don Lop. 'T is a most worthy blade; But near an inch too short: and next the hiltâ Just here, my lordâan eighth or so too broad, And nigh a pound too heavy. Yet, for all, A worthy blade, though somewhat out of fashion. A true Toledo, if I'm not mistaken? Cal. Not so: no man can tell its origin; But divers quaint and wondrous legends hang Their superstitions on this mystic steel. Some say that 'mid the globe's eternal fires, The laboring gnomes, with many an impious spell, That made earth shake and stagger from her orbit, Tempered and forged the metal of this blade. Don Lop. A wondrous tale, more wonderful if true. Cal. I cannot vouch it. Don Lop. Ah, I nigh forgotâ Whom do we fight? Cal. Don Luis, sir. Don Lop. Don Death! My lord, the man 's a practised duellist; Has killed more scores than I have met in fight. He'll name his thrusts, before he strikes a blow, And put them home, despite your wariest skill. Then there 's his trick, a sleight he caught in Franceâ Thus, thusâ(Passes.)âthe shrewdest thrust beneath the guard; 'T is fatal as the plague. Cal. Enough of this. We fight within an hourâyou'll find me here. Don Lop. Your servant, sir.âAdieu! [Exit.] Cal. They 're all the same, These grinning courtiers, all smiles and bows, All rules and etiquette. Such are the men Who have our monarch's ear, and guide his councils. (Enter Oliver.) How sad you look!âDid you not find Don Luis? Oliver. Ah, yes, my lord, I found him at a feast, Drinking and roaring, 'mid the wealth you gave. He spied me out, and in politest terms Inquired your lordship's health. Then turned again, And of my lady asked with blandest voice: No feature moved when I proclaimed her dead. With that he rose, and, smiling towards his friends, Proposed your lordship's health. 'T was not in fear, But at the act I shook, and my chilled blood Crawled coldly backward on its quivering source, To see such baseness lodged in human form. I flung your challenge in the monster's face, And came to seek you here. Cal. The mocking villain!âWell, well, let that go. I'm nigh to death, or I should hate mankind. Oli. O say not so; there may be days of peaceâ Cal. His sword will not rob life of many hours. When I left home I felt I 'd ne'er return; All things appeared so mournful to my view. The old trees shook their dark green heads above, And waved their branches as if taking leave; The grass was bending with the morning dew, And dropped its woful tribute as I passed; Ay, and the very flowers, the little flowers, Turned on me their soft eyes o'errun with tears. When we had gained the pass between the hills, Whose windings shut my castle from the sight, I paused to take one last, long look at home. Alas! the very castle seemed to move, And beckon sadly in the flickering air; The old gray turrets wavered to and fro, Nodding their hoary heads as if in grief. I could not choose but weep; the man broke down, And my heart fluttered like a timid girl's. Ah! since her death, a cloud has crossed the earth, And everywhere I see it. But thou 'lt return: Now swear to me, if thou dost love me yet, To do what I command. Oli. I swear, my lord. Cal. Thou know'st my latter days have chiefly past In patient labors of philosophy; And from my toil a studious book was born, Whose gathered wisdom was designed for manâ Swear to destroy it! Oli. Pray forgive me this; I cannot, dare not. What, that mighty book O'er which I 've bent until the stars grew dim, And morning caught me o'er the magic page; Forgetful of my task, my pen all dry, Enrapt in reading what I should have copied? O, pardon me, my lord; 't would be a crime Worse than oath-breaking, worse than blasphemy! Cal. Didst thou love DoÃ±a Alda, Oliver? Oli. Past love, my lord; but now I love her more. Cal. And wouldst thou see some scribbler drag her name, Coupled to infamy and red-cheeked shame, Or slimed with pity of a vulgar mind, Into the preface of a book you love?â Wouldst see her live in misery immortal, Preserved for time coldly to comment on?â Wouldst have her memory, which you hold so dear, Bandied about, the scoff and jest of fools? No, no; before this bitter thing shall be, Let my name perish from the thoughts of men. Oli. And wouldst thou die in very name, my lord? Cal. Only in name,âno further can I die. Oli. We know not that. Cal. Know not! then vain is knowledge. All nature criesâWhatever is, must be! Earth's forms may change, but time can ne'er destroy The smallest atom in the universe; Much less this life of intellect, the soul, Whose very form is changeless.âDeath is not! Serene, and calm, and indestructible, Above the touch of chance, or sin, or time, On these heaven-scaling attributes shall soar, In infinite progression towards their source:â In death is knowledge! Oli. I will do it, sir. Cal. Enough, I shall die happy. Get thee hence, And have my servants near the meeting place, To bear me from the field. But, on their lives, Let them not interfere till all is o'er; And should Don Luis kill me, let him pass. Oli. They may, but I will not. (Aside.) I'll see 't is done. [Exit.] (Enter Don Lopez.) Don Lopez. The terms are all agreed; though, I declare, I had some trouble with that old Miguelâ He is Don Luis' second. By this light! He 'd mounted you, with lances in your hands, To run a tilt like Quixotes. Tell me, sir, Does the first blood decide the combat o'er. Calaynos. The first death, sir, decides this combat o'er. Don Lop. Of course, of course; but death is out of date: 'T is not the way we fight in these fair days: Now gentlemen may fight without a scratch. I do assure you, sir, that in a duel Life is as safe as if you sat in church; You have the honor without fear of harm.â Will not the first blood do? Cal. I'm of a race Who seldom drew a sword except to kill; They never bled, like leeches, nor will I: Death, and not honor, is the thing I wish. This duel, friend, did not originate From treading on a toe without excuse. Don Lop. 'T is out of date; but as you please, my lord. Have you e'er fought before? Cal. No, not of late: But, in my youth, through Salamanca's school I fought my way, and lost no credit there. Don Lop. Ah, yes; I 've heard, they ever held your blade The foremost steel in Salamanca's walls: 'T is a good school.âBut watch his French deviceâ The thrust beneath the guard. 'T is nigh the time. Cal. Then, sir, lead on. 'T is ne'er too soon for me. [Exeunt.] SCENE III. The Fields near Seville. Enter Don Luis and Don Miguel, meeting Calaynos, Don Lopez, and Oliver. Don Lopez. Stand here, my lord. Calaynos. Let there be no delay. Don Miguel. (To Don Luis.) Stand here, my boy. Don Luis. (Aside.) He 's ill; I'll kill him easily. (Don Lopez and Don Miguel advance.) Don Lop. 'T is a fine day, and this a glorious ground. Don M. Yes, for a fight with good old-fashioned blades. Don Lop. Excuse me, sir, but we must follow custom. Don M. Yes, afar off.âHere is Don Luis' skewer. [Gives the sword.] Don Lop. (Measuring.) 'T is full an inch too long.âI sent the measureâ There 's no excuseâthey cannot fight to-day. Don M. What cares a man against an inch or two? Bah! on your forms! His grandsire, in his day, Would draw his dagger 'gainst an ashen spear. Don Lop. I have a name, sir, among gentlemen, Which I'll not hazard on so grave a thing. Oliver. (Advancing.) Why pause you, gentlemen? My lord is ill, And loses strength by standing such a time. Don Lop. Don Luis' blade is full an inch too long. Oli. The murderous coward! [Aside.] [Goes to Calaynos and returns.] Go on, gentlemen; If 't is a foot too long, my lord cares not. Don M. Said like his grandsire:âthere the old blood spoke! Don Lop. Well, as he wills; but I again protestâ You'll bear me witness, sir, before the world? Don M. Yes, yes. Stand here, my friend. [To Don Luis.] Don Lop. Stand here, my lord. [To Calaynos.] Draws, sirsâadvanceâguardâ Don M. God defend the right! Don Lop. Heavens! what queer phrases has this antique man! [Aside.] (Calaynos and Don Luis fight.) My man fights well. Don M. He fights too much for blood: He'll catch a wound. Don Lop. There 's his French trickâI knew it! (Calaynos is wounded.) Lopez and Miguel. Hold, gentlemen! Cal. Stand backâbeware Calaynos! Don M. Thus spoke his grandsire when his blood was up. Don Lop. Again! (Calaynos is wounded.) Lopez and Miguel. Hold, gentlemenâforbear, forbear! (They rush between.) Don Lop. Are you not satisfied? Don Luis. I am, for one. Cal. I came to die, or be that villain's death!â Stand from between us; or, by heaven's great king, I'll make a path across your carcasses! Don Lop. Well, well, go onâbut this is bloody work! (They fight: Calaynos disarms Don Luis.) Cal. Turn dog, and fly! Don Luis. Now while I 've legs to stand Cal. Down, down, and beg! Don Luis. No, never to a Moor! Cal. Ha, wretch! [Kills Don Luis.] (Calaynos staggers and falls.) Oli. My lord, you 're wounded. Cal. Yes, to death. Come nearer, sonâI have short time to live.â Why dost thou weep? Oli. O, why do I not die? Cal. Nay, live, dear Oliver, to think of usâ Of poor, poor Alda, and her buried lord: Thou 'lt come at sun-down o'er the dewy grass, And kneel beside us, and thou 'lt pray for her. Was she not wronged?âbut pure, but pure as heaven! Oli. Most pure, my lord. Cal. O bless thee, for those words! Come close, my son: thou wert my only friend, And next to Alda in my heart thou stoodst. Wilt thou forgive me the harsh words I said, For that false manâby Heaven's arm smote, not mine? Oli. O woe! O woe!âNay, nay, 't was all my fault. Cal. Not soâcome nearer. Thou wilt bury me Next to dear Alda.âNow sweet death draws on: I feel his icy breath upon my cheekâ The gates of knowledge lift to let me inâ Already, half the mystery of life Rolls from my soul, like a divided veil! The secrets of the universe unclose, And I am filled with light! Oli. O, mighty soul! Cal. Stand from before meâgive me airâI choke. Next Aldaânext my wifeâwifeâO! [Dies.] Oli. The stony world may smile at broken hearts; But there lies one cracked to the very core. (Enter Servants, and group round the body.) Tread softlyâhere is death! ANNE BOLEYN: A TRAGEDY.

Enter, as from the Council, Duke of Norfolk, Duke of Suffolk, Duke of Richmond, Marquis of Exeter, and Earl of Arundel. Norfolk. Nay, nay, my lords, affairs must not stand thus. She is my kinswoman, and I confess, If but on my estate her influence bore, I 'd pass it by unchecked. No private griefs Should wring a word from me, nor tutor me To raise the hand that snaps a natural tie. But see, my lordsâ Suffolk. 'Ods blood! we have seen enough: We have been open-eyed, your grace of Norfolk. I trust we hold one mind? All. We do, we do. Suf. Why, then, your grace, we have stared ourselves stone blind, Stared all our man to palsied impotence, At this she-basilisk. Some years ago, From the mere dregs and offscourings of your house, We saw this girl emerge, and step by step Crawl slowly upward to the top of powerâ Why, she was queen before her crown was on!â Till, now, she threatens us from such a throne Of downright rule as queen ne'er held before. Nay, pucker not your brows, good Duke of Richmond While conscience echoes what I bluntly speak: Your royal father, more than any here, Has felt her deadly witchcraft. Richmond. Fie, for shame! I thought this meeting one of policy: It never crossed me that five stalwart men Had leagued their brains to gabble scandal thus Of a poor queen, whose sole discovered crimeâ Heaven send a rain of such bewildering sin!â Is too much beauty. Nor. Therein lies her power. Rich. Then we depute you, as her nearest kin, To play Saint Dunstan to this fair Elgiva; To raze her eyes out, sear her blushing skin, Twist off her nose, and slit her pretty mouth; But O, 'fore heaven! lay not your manhoods off, And stand here railing like a pack of drabs! Arundel. Patience, your grace; let Suffolk have his say; This was but prelude to the main affair. Rich. Nay, if his song cannot out-go that pitch, Henceforth I'll herd with women. Know, my lords, To ease you of her beauty's deadly grief, Her so-called strongest hold, my father's love, Is well-nigh yielded to a nimble wight,â No higher than your arm, your grace of Suffolk,â Through herald words, and showers of gentle looks. Therefore, I counsel we withdraw our powers Of bearded men, nor strive to win by storm That woman's citadel, our sovereign's heart. Suf. Your grace may flout and game at Holy Writ, Or any solemn truth; nor stands a fact Less in repute, because an empty jest Has cracked thereon, and shown its hollowness. Rich. I cry you mercy, lord of gravity! Now wherefore meet we? Exeter, speak out. You have not strayed away in idle words; From which I argue you have kept to heart This grave affair. Exeter. Thus is it, then, my lords: We all have sorrowing seen the growing power Of her we call the queenâwe call, I say; For, in my humble judgment, Katharine, Our sometime mistressâ Rich. Heaven defend us all! He'll talk till cock-crow on that threadbare theme. Will no one help us? Is there no one here Who knows exactly why five fools have met? Nor. Thus, then, your grace. We peers have nigh become A mere incumbrance in the council-seats. Rich. Why, here is a man who has his wits alive! Nor. Spare me, your grace; too heavy this for sport. Rich. Well, I'll be silent till the end. Go on. Nor. This spawn of ours, whom I must blush to ownâ Rich. Ha! more abuse! Nor. âUsurps the state entire; Makes and breaks treaties; changes faiths and priests; Empties the treasury, and fills it up, By loans and taxes, such as she may will; Sends one abroad, and calls another home; Orders a marquis here, and there a duke. All this she does, and more than I can name, With but such counsel as her wits may lend, Counting us peers as toys. Rich. Ah, now indeed We reach the body of things politic. If 't is a fight of wits, I am with you, sirs; Though, I misgive, we shall be shrewdly cuffed. Suf. All thisâyour grace of Richmond, mark we wellâ All this unqueenly power she strictly holds By the fond tenure of our sovereign's love. Let but the light, which now he suns her in, Vanish in frowns, and this same haughty moon, That floods our prospect with her filchÃ©d beams, Sinks to her native blackness. Rich. So, stop there! My lords, I'll join you in your enterprise Against the sweet usurpings of our queen, Perchance, when I behold you four tall men Ranked on Tower Hill, the headsman standing by; When meek-faced Suffolk is about to say, âGood people, I confess I suffer justly.â Arun. Exeter, I have caught cold by standing here; I feel the shrewdest of rheumatic pains Twitching my spine above the shoulder-blades.â I must withdraw. [Apart to Exeter.] Ex. Nay, nay, stand fast; he jests. Rich. When noble Norfolk's humbly-worded letter, âTouching his close connection with the queen,â Meets in reply her gracious writ of death; When scurvy poets sing in bastard rhymes, âThe doleful ballad of lord Arundel;â When slip-shod wenches, with out-popping eyes, And all unbreathed, pant out to passers by, âPray, tell me, sirs, where dies false Exeter?â Then will I aid you, then I'll run amain, Grovel and crawl, and kiss the royal shoe, And howl for pardon which she will not grant.â Till then, adieu! Nor. Your grace will keep our counsel? Rich. Zounds! I am a gentleman; and prove it, sir, By having better business to my hands Than the undoing of my female kin. [Exit.] Ex. He 's a hot heart; but such are mostly true. Suf. What was the hint yon brain-struck bastard dropped About the king's love suffering change to Anne? Arun. Nay, I know not; he dealt so much in tropes: His grace of Norfolk is a poet's father, He may resolve us. Nor. I have thought of that. 'T was a bare hint, but worth our scrutiny. Ex. Ay, ay, indeed. Suf. I half believe it meant: When Richmond bays, there is store of game afoot; We have found it so. Nor. I'll to his majesty. If this prove true, our cause is well-nigh won. Suf. Your grace will summon us to hear the news? Nor. Trust me; if true, I'll be too full to hold. Arun. Methinks the country air would ease these aches About my neck; another talk like this Nigh wrench my head off. [Aside.] Nor. Till we meet, farewell! Be secret, but be watchful. Exe. Time is fate. Suf. We have not pulled the crafty Wolsey down, To whimper tamely at a woman's heels! [Exeunt.] SCENE II. Another Room in the Palace. Enter Jane Seymour, pursued by King Henry. King Henry. O, prithee, tarry! I am out of windâ I'll not have breath to tell you how I love. Stand, I adjure you, on your loyalty! Jane Seymour. Now am I safe; I owe you loyalty, And you owe me protection. [Kneels.] King H. Nonsense, child! [Raises her.] You are far safer with plain Harry Tudor, Than if the monarchs of all Christendom Circled you round. For what are angry swords To the raised finger of the baby Love? I say, I love you; that implies respect. Jane S. Respect should teach you not to urge your love. King H. Sweetheart, pray hear me. I am all unused To lover's logic, to the mincing phrase That snares a heart in nets of sophistry; I'll not attack your passion through your brain; But at your love's unconquered citadel I'll sit me down, with rough, unmannered haste, And bid you open in your sovereign's name. Jane, do you love me? Jane S. With all duty, sir. King H. Tut, tut! no duty. Would you be my queen? Jane S. Your wife, my liege; the tempting name of queen Makes no addition to a loving mind. Love asks but love. King H. So, well said, mistress mine! I never thought to win your dainty heart By bartering for it an unfeeling crown. Love comes unsought, nor heeds the voice of power: The very gem which, from his purple throne, A fuming king may gaze and thunder for, Beneath the willows of some muddy brook A listless rustic may disclose and wear. Then, as mere Hal, the shepherd, if you listâ Barring all sovereignty with equal termsâ Say, do you love me? [Kneels.] Jane S. Maiden shame, my liegeâ King H. Liege me no moreâHalâHarryâwhat you will Jane S. My maiden heart should send its blushing force Of startled blood to whelm my guilty face, While I stand parleying with her dearest foe; Yet am I paleâah! pale with fear to think What woful fate may be reserved for me, If our right noble queenâ King H. Hell blast the queen! [Starts up.] Jane S. Ha! did I gall you so? (Aside.) O pardon me! King H. Girl, I am well-nigh maddened by the queen. A pack of yelling fancies bait my soul, And each tongue seems to cheer the horrid rout, When my fierce conscience criesâThe queen, the queen! Jane S. O, had I suffered her extremest rage, Ere I thus angered you! King H. Nay, I'll not scold. Forgive me, sweetheart, my unmannered spleen. My soul is much perplexed and tempest-tossed About my marriage with this cunning queen: I fear me, Lucifer made her a bait To trap my soul. Jane S. O, you arch hypocrite! [Aside.] King H. Methinks the Pope was rightâay, must be right; Since by the creed he is infallible.â Jane S. Not by the new one. King H. There the sorrow lies: I have main doubts of our new-gendered creed. If he be right, then is our union void; For, by his voice, poor Katharine was my wife.â I will consult my lords on this grave point. Jane S. Your nobles wear your eyes; but, then, the peopleâ King H. I'll make half England see without their heads, But I will wed you! Sweetheart, promise me, If I can offer an unmortgaged hand, That you will take it. Jane S. Thus I promise you. [Gives her hand.] King H. When next we meet, I'll show you many a way, To lead us from this labyrinth of doubt, As soft and thornless to your pretty feet As the rich velvet whereon you shall tread To mount the dais of our English throne. Till then, adieu! (They separateâshe rushes back.) Jane S. Sweet Harry, be not rash! King H. O, I would fawn, and play the stricken cur To any groom, whose love-illumined wit Could steal from time the weary chain of days That links our purpose to its hopeful end. [Exeunt severally.] SCENE III. An Ante-room in the Palace. Enter the Duke of Norfolk, meeting an Usher. Norfolk. Has the king risen? Usher. Anon he will come forth. Nor. I will await him. Ush. That is spared your grace. (Enter King Henry.) King Henry. Ha! Norfolk, Norfolk, you have come in time; There is no face more welcome than your own. I 'd rather see you, in this private way, Than in your dignity of counsellor. Nor. Your majesty o'errates my little worth. King H. Not a whit, man. Sir Usher, keep the door; Let no one enter till his grace withdraws. [Exit Usher.] Nor. I came on business of her majestyâ King H. 'Ods blood! the queen again! Enough, good Norfolk. I have met no man since I arose to-day, Who came not whimpering of her majesty. Pray change your style; the fashion had grown stale Ere you were up. Nor. O ho! and how is this? [Aside.] King H. Norfolk, 't is pitiful! No hour last night, But my sharp senses, tuned to painful pitch, Started, like guilt, upon the faintest sound; The very mice stalked by like sentinels Ringing in proof; the clock beside my bed Hammered the hours like a gross forging smith; The gentlest gust of air howled like the damned; And when a noise, which in the joyous day Would scarce make damsels wink, fell on my ear, Up from my restless bed, like one possessed, I bounded, with wide-stretched and glaring eyes, And half criedâTreason! Nor. Sir, I am amazed. Shall I go seek your majesty's physicians? King H. Ah! 't is a grief their physic cannot touch. My conscience, Norfolk. Nor. Hum! join this to that, And I might get some credit as a prophet. [Aside.] King H. (My conscienceâO!) Nor. And 't was his âconscience, O!â Made such a pother ere Queen Katharine fell. [Aside.] King H. Nay; do you hear me? 't was my conscience, sir. Nor. Certes, within a month, another queen. [Aside.] Grief has bereft me of the power of speech. Might Cranmer help you? King H. No; you are the man. Nor. Deign to unfold your majesty's distress; And what so weak a man as Norfolk can, He'll gladly undertake. King H. Hear, then, the cause. You know our present queenâ[Listens.] Nor. And hear her, too. Queen Anne. (Without.) What, sir, deny me to his majesty? Usher. (Without.) But 't is his majesty's direct command. Queen A. (Without.) Stand from before me; I will answer it. (Enter Queen Anne, followed by the Usher.) Queen A. Your highnessâ King H. Fellow with an usher's wand, Hand me your cane. Begone, your place is wanted! Ush. Your highness, 't was the queenâ King H. Knave, bite your tongue, Or you may talk your head off! Fly, I say! And if within the precincts of our court Your traitor face be seen two hours from now, I'll break your body in as many pieces As this frail stick! [Breaks up the wand.] [Exit Usher.] Queen A. Nay, royal sir, I pray Some show of mercy to yon guiltless man. If there was fault, believe it mine alone: He dared not stop my entrance. King H. Say you so? Well, madam, I believe it yours alone: And much it vexes us that you, our queen, Whose acts should but reflect our royal will, Show, thus, a glass whence every traitor's eye May take the foul impression of himself. Queen A. My liege, forgive my over-zealous haste; The cause that brought me is no common one. Our faithful Protestants in Germany Are sorely pressedâ King H. If they be pressed to death, I care not. There are those within my realm, Gross, headstrong Protestants, puffed up with pride, Who should be sent abroad to get a squeeze. Nor. Ha! ha! your majesty. [Laughing.] Queen A. What owl is that Crying so merrily as shadows thicken? O, I beseech your majesty, sustain The noble cause so happily begun! You are the instrument, by Heaven picked out From all the famous potentates of earth, To work its high behest. Yea, after times Shall lay your memory as a sacred thing Upon their altars, radiant with such beams, Shot clear from heaven, that slander's eagle eye, Dazzled with light, can challenge no defect Most blessed of men! when the great trump of doom Shall to its centre crack the startled world, And cheek by cheek the king and slave awake, Think what a band of heaven-persuading saints Shall circle God, and raise their tongues for you! King H. Why here 's Erasmus in a farthingale! What say you, Norfolk? Nor. Nothing now, my liege: My brain is clearer in the council-room. I pray her majesty, the queen, may cease To load her spirits with our state affairs: The rugged shoulders of tried counsellors Can scarce endure the burden of these times; And much I fearâ Queen A. I see through what you mean, Good uncle Norfolk. You are one of those Big bloated toads that cumber up sweet earth, A mere deformity in common sight; Yet, 'neath the royal sun, you swell and swell, Blinking your dull but self-sufficient eyes Around the narrow bound your view may grasp, And then shake heaven with angel merriment, To hear you splutterââLord, all this is ours!â King H. 'Ods wounds! forbear! Nor. I'll give receipt for this. [Aside.] King H. Why rate you thus our friend and counsellor? Your uncle Norfolk, whose unfaltering zeal Has seemed to be the shadow of our will!â Queen A. But seen in sunshine. King H. If 't would please your highness To blow these noxious vapors from your mind, Have pity on us, nor infect our ears. Queen A. Your pardon, sir, if my unbroken tongue For once ran riot with my better sense. King H. Ay, 't is a wilful jade. Queen A. But hear me out. King H. We'll make no purchase from the samples givenâ Preaching and railing. 'T is but courtesy, If you require this room, that we withdraw. Come, Norfolk, come.âWhat said his holiness? [Exit, leaning on Norfolk.] Queen A. What means this heavy feeling at my heart? What means the king by this unwonted coldness? What means my uncle by his insolence? Why stood the king with an approving smile, And heard my most unnatural enemy Offer reproof in semblance of advice? I have seen the timeâay, not a month agoâ When, in the fury of his lion mood, He 'd brained the scoffer with his royal hand. But times have changedâah! have they changed indeed? Has my life passed the zenith of its glory? Must I make ready for the gathering clouds That dog the pathway of a setting sun? Well, let them come! The blaze of my decline Shall turn to gold the dull enshrouding mists, And show the world a spectacle more grand Than the young splendor in which first I rose. Ha! ha! par Dieu! now this is marvellous! A queen whose crown has scarcely ta'en the shape Of her young brow, the anointing oil scarce dried, The shouts still buzzing in my deafened ears, With which the people hailed me on the throne; Not two years queen, and moralizing thus, Like fourscore crawling to its certain grave! This is sheer weakness, the dull malady Of little minds that chafe at little ills. Great souls are cheerful with their inborn power, Feeling themselves the rulers of events, The sinewy smoothers of the roughest times, And not the slaves of outward influence. Despair is a fellow with a moody brow, Who shuts a dungeon door upon himself, And then groans at his bondage. Fear, avaunt! Thy shades but trespass on my noon of power. (Several Courtiers cross the stage, bowing. Enter Thomas Wyatt.) Ho! Wyatt, hither. Wyatt. Did your highness call? Queen A. Where go you, sir? Wyatt. I and these gentlemen, Inflamed with holy zeal of selfishness, Make to the Mecca of our hopes, the king, A solemn pilgrimage. Queen A. What news abroad? Wyatt. Not a breath stirring. Queen A. Say they aught of me? Wyatt. If praise might tire the courtiers' flowing tongues, Ere this they had been mute: to-day, as ever, The sweets of Hybla drop from every mouth. As I came here, a crowd of Protestants, All fire-burned artisans and men of pith, Their new-made zeal sitting like riot on them, Brandished the fragments of some papal crosiers, And criedââLong live Saint Anne!â Queen A. Mockery! If history should hand my name to time, God grant its fame may rest on firmer base Than the disjointed sainthood of a mob! I keep you waiting. Fortune speed your suit. [Exit Wyatt.] (Another throng of Courtiers cross the stage, bowing profoundly.) These straws of courtiers watch the royal wind, And first predict the coming hurricane; Certes, as yet I see no adverse signs. Some state affairs have galled the fretful edge Of hasty Harry's rash but loving heart: Anon he will return, and, cap in hand, Cry, âPardon, Anne!â But I'll pout and swell, Tossing my head, and tapping thus my foot; Then all my pride, at one great, eager gasp, I'll seem to swallow, as I bound to him; And then I'll pat his cheeks, and call him âBear,â And chide him gently for his angry mood. But when his eyes blush at their starting tears, I'll laugh aloud, and puzzle all his wits. So from this egg, of seeming noxious wrath, Shall spring a new-born love of double power. To-morrow sees a messenger despatched To threaten Germany with fiery war, If wrong befall our faithful Lutherans: Whereat our uncle, the good Duke of Norfolk, Shall gnaw his nether lip off with chagrin. Ho! cheer thee, Anne! darksome passages Oft mount to prospects, but for them unknown. [Exit.] ACT II. SCENE I. A Room in Whitehall Palace. Enter Jane Seymour. Jane Seymour. A queen, a queen! a real anointed queen, With trains of maids and smiling courtiers, Diamonds like stones, and softest velvet pall To grace the shoulders of my majesty! All eyes on me, my beauties sung in verse; Each featureâay, the tithe of any oneâ More than enough to swell a rondeau up! My wishes fairies, flying at a sign To bring the substance of my latest thought! My kin ennobled to the last degree; My son a king, my daughters wed to kings; My name the pith of gravest history! This is too much! I cannot, if I would, Put by the crown which fortune offers me. But, then, the queen?âThe queen o'erruns with pride; Last Tuesday week she cruelly rated me. What mercy showed she to poor Katharine? I am but the instrument of justest Heaven To make requital for her own misdeeds. The king abhors her, and inclines to meâ Lo! nature points the path which I should take. Just as I mount, so must the queen descend; We hang in adverse scales. Now 't is too late; My faith is plighted to the king, and I Will dare the issue for the glittering prize! (Enter King Henry.) King Henry. All joy befall you, darling! [Embraces her.] Jane S. Welcome, sir! King H. Are you still constant? Jane S. Can you ask me that? You have descended from your royal state, And deigned to honor one so low as I; Chosen me, unworthy, from the common throng, Nor cast your eyes upon the maiden hands Of princesses that wait outstretched for you: As well might the dull earth reject the sun, That changes its grimed face to virgin gold, As I refuse the glory of your love. Henceforth my person is a sacred thing, A common vessel turned to holy use; And should you now disdain my little worth, All your great kingdom holds no mate for me. King H. Tut! mistress, with your gloomy fantasies; And be not jealous of my love so soon. Ours is a mere exchange of heart for heart; Crowns and such baubles enter not our trade. That which I have, the sceptre of a king, Possession makes nigh worthless in my eyes; That which I have not, your own beauteous self, O'er all stale toys of royalty I prize. Jane S. Then be content; my heart is yours alone. As virgin as the breast wherein it beats. It rests with you to lift my fortunes up On level with your own. King H. By Heaven, I will!â But how, but how? Let us to counsel, love. [Seats himself, with Jane Seymour on his knee.] There 's Norfolk, eager at our first design; But he is a Papist; to restore the Pope Part of his creed;âa doubtful counsellor. If I retrieve the Pope's authority, Upon the act my marriage is annulled, And I am free. True, true; but pause we here: How shall we satisfy the plundered monks Whom we have ousted from their fat domains? How our good nobles who possess them now? Jane S. And how the people? King H. Let them fight it out. They are half and half, Papists and Protestants, And so divided, easily subdued. I mainly fear to reinstate the Pope; His holy finger is in every dish; I must be king within my own domain; Yet if the thing must beâ'Ods wounds! my love, This matrimonial knot was hard to tie; But 't was mere pastime to undoing it. Would that the Grecian's sword might cut itâHa!â Jane S. What mean you, sir? Why do you glare around? And pale as death! King H. As death! Jane S. Ay, and as fearful. Rouse, rouse, sir! You are illâI'll call relief. King H. Nay, sit you down again. Jane S. But are you well? King H. 'T was but a passing thought that tortured me, As one may feel who murders. Clasp me tight; Pain would be comfort to such awful visions. (Enter Queen Anne, behind.) Queen Anne. Ha! Jane S. O, good heavens! the queen! Queen A. In luckless time For you, base minion, treble traitoress, False to yourself, false to your state and me! The foulest sin that woman may commit Made doubly hideous by the circumstance! What! in the palace that contains your queen, The very seat of England's dignity, Whence virtue, as the simple commons deem, Springs to illumine this majestic realm! Have you no shame? Wear you that brazen front When I hold up a mirror to your crime? Is not your Gorgon nature turned to stone, At the bare glimpse of your own ugliness? King H. Peace, sweetheart, peace! all shall be well for you; Your maid is guiltless. Queen A. Have you found a tongue? What sorcery bestowed this power of speech? Or has poor shame, bedazzled at her glory, Shrunk from the world? King H. This foully-slandered maid Is half distraught at your mad violence. Queen A. And dare you, sir, before your injured queenâ You, the copartner of her guilt and shame, Protect yon wanton? King H. Dare I, dare I, madam! 'Ods wounds! who 's king in England? Hold your tongue, You rank defier of your sovereign's power! Have you not learned whose presence you are in? Or must I teach you by some sterner means? Queen A. O! shameless husband! King H. She is pure, I say: And, by high Heaven, as pure shall you remain From touch of mine, till malice gnaw you up!â This is forever. Come, sweet mistress Jane. [Exit, leading off Jane Seymour.] Queen A. O, God! O, God!âThe kingâNay, Harry, Harry, Come back; I willâO! killing agony! Is there no pity in the heart of man? Plead for me, girlâhe loves youâplead for me! I am his wife, your queen, your loving mistress. I will forgive you, I will cherish you, I'll love you dearer than my dearest friend.â Gone, gone forever! Said he not, forever? Kind Heaven, have mercy on my feebleness! If this be trial of my strength, I yield; I do confess my utter helplessness; I bow me prostrate, a poor nerveless womanâ A queen no more. I'll trample on my pride, And follow meekly where thy finger points. By Heaven, not so! This is a grievous wrong, By man inflicted. Devils ordered this, And they shall pay it!âHear me, writhing souls, That minister around sin's ebon throne! If to these murderers of my heart's dear peace A child be born, may she, in that sweet time When infant babble opes all heaven to her, Feel the cold hand of death draw, day by day, The clinging spirit from her! May her child Live in the vexings of a troubled time, And, issueless, die young! May heâO God, I cannot bid a curse light on the head Of him my child calls father! Bless him, Heaven! Give him the peace which he has stolen from me! [Exit.] SCENE II. A Street in London. Enter Mark Smeaton and Ralph Loney, meeting. Loney. Mark Smeaton, if I breathe! Smeaton. Who are you, fellow, That thus accost her majesty's chief groom? Lon. So soon forgotten! Know you not Ralph Loney, Whilom your school-mate? Shame upon you, Mark! Had I turned Peter, and denied you thus, When the big smith made at you with his hammer, You would not bear your silken coat to-day. Smea. Ralph ConeyâConey?â Lon. Loney, Master Mark. How should I call your name, not knowing you? Smea. Think you, this is the first, or hundredth time, That knaves have claimed acquaintance with my name? We of the court are known to every one; And I in chief, as the queen's favored groomâ Nay, I may say, her most familiar groom, Ranked more as friend than courtly servitorâ Am most conspicuous to the vulgar gaze. It would but prove a new-come clown in town, Had you not known me. Lon. Here are tidings gained To please his grace of Suffolk. [Aside.] Bless me, sir! I pray forgive my vulgar forwardness; Indeed I knew not of your dignity. Your worship would not harm a thoughtless man. Nay, frown not, good Sir Mark.âDo I misjudge, In calling you Sir Mark? Smea. On the way thither; To-morrow, or next day, that style may suit; Perchance, a higher one. Resume your beaver. Let me seeâLoneyâRalph?âUpon my life, When I reflect, I have a faint idea That once I knew you. Lon. I will freshen you. Do you remember, on an Easter day, How the fierce urchins, half insane for meat, And rancorous with the bile of fishy Lent, Into a green and filthy pool bobbed you, Merely because they could? How I alone, In pity of your plightâyour slimy plightâ Your most nose-wrenching plightâ Smea. Good Loney, cease! The zenith-topping sun forgets the clouds Which, in the dirty dawn, he struggled through! Lon. Now, what bystander that had seen you rise From that green pond, fresh with your miry coat, Had ever prophesied these gilded clothes? And who that saw me, with my broken staff, Thrash to their doors your routed enemies, Could have foretold my present mean estate? I should be captain of a great armada; You should be dragging horse-ponds. Smea. Prithee, cease! These boyish pranks disgust my nicer sense. Lon. I would not vex you; but it comforts me, And reconciles me to my lot on earth, To summon back my childhood. As I then Had my full hours of triumph and renown, So have you now; thus fate is justified. Smea. You seem to be an honest fellow, Ralph; Nor care I if from my abounding stone, Ever replenished by my gracious mistress, I give a parcel. [Gives a purse.] Lon. Luck be with you, sir! Smea. When that is emptied, I'll replenish it, If you will drink my royal lady's health. Lon. You stand high in her favor. Smea. Did you know The height I stand, it would amaze your ears. Adieu! we'll meet again. [Exit.] Lon. Farewell, poor fool! We'll meet too soon for you. Hell snatch the purse! [Throws it from him.] It burns like heated brass. Now to the duke. Mark Smeaton's vanity, a seeming trifle, May in his grace's hands work great results; Ay, even the unqueening of a queen. Alas! alas! poor Mark, that thy fine feathers Should draw the fowler's closely-prying eye! So must it be; why should I hesitate? Curse on his bounty! While we are beasts of prey, The little game must ever feed the great. [Exit.] SCENE III. A Room in the Palace of the Duke of Suffolk. Enter Duke of Norfolk, Duke of Suffolk, and Marquis of Exeter. Suffolk. Where 's Arundel, Lord Exeter? Exeter. Poor man! His over boldness in once joining us Has scared him from a second wish of it: One valiant thought has terrified the rest. He bade me mention that some strict affairs Drew him away. When we have won the game, I pledge my faith, we'll have him bickering hot, And bold as Mars to share the dangerous spoils. Norfolk. We can well spare him. Since his majesty Has shown such favor to our enterprise, They who at first turned from us, virtue-sick, Deem it a blessÃ©d thing to be enrolled. (Enter Earl of Arundel.) Welcome, my lord! Arundel. A dear salute to me. I rode four horses dead, to keep my faith, And only reached you as the fifth fell lame. Good Lord! good Lord! they say his majestyâ I had this from a sure but private sourceâ Has gained intelligence of our design, And smiles at it. Ugh! sirs, I'm out of breath: When I have blown a while, I'll tell you more. Suf. Nay, spare your wind.â Nor. Poh! poh! don't anger him. [Apart to Suffolk.] Arun. Ha! you know all? Nor. Yes, every tittle of it. Arun. Then, sirs, to counsel. Ex. Now he is head assassin. [Aside.] Nor. His majesty is much perplexed with doubts; Nor knows he, better than ourselves, a plan To rid the state of his ambitious queen. She has committed no so gross excess As may subject her to the common law: A faithful wife, untainted in her fameâ Ex. And so was Katharine. Suf. Come, come, be blunt: We must destroy her, by fair means or foul. (Enter a Servant.) Servant. Your grace's servant, Master Loney, waits. Suf. Let him wait, fellowâI am much engaged. Ser. I told him so. He said his business was About the matter you have now in hand. Suf. Ha! said he so? Admit him then. (Exit Servant.) My lords, Be not provoked by his familiar bearing. He is my jackal, a most useful one, But one who hates his trade. (Enter Ralph Loney.) Loney. My speech is short. I met a youthful schoolfellow of mine, A rare musician, now her highness' groom: The man 's a fool, and boasted of the love His mistress bore him. He would go still further, To gratify his itching vanity, And criminate the queen. Suf. Go make him drunk; Take witnesses, fit men, and pump him dry. Lon. I will obey, sir.â'T is but one man more. [Exit.] Suf. You'll scarce believe, at times that fellow laughs; But never when about my secret work; Then he is ever sullen. Arun. A strange knave. Suf. But faithful. Ex. Something grave may come of this. Suf. Ay, something which, by us interpreted, May compromise the virtue of the queen. Nor. Perhaps. O find me but some little charge, Less weighty than the air-drawn gossamerâ Some dim tradition, gathered in a dream Seen by the blearing vision of a drunkardâ Some hearsay mumbled by a maniac's lips, With fever scorched upon his dying bedâ Some words the roaring tongues of angry blasts, Or zephyrs, lisping through the sluggish trees, Hummed in the ears of musing fantasyâ Find one of these, to frame a charge upon, And I will warrant trial expedite, And sure conviction, though an angel plead. Suf. I'll answer, Loney's craft unearths a charge As horrible as death. Ex. What mean you, sirs, To bring a deadly fault against the guiltless? Arun. Ay, prove it too. Ex. This is flat villany! 'T is now too late to shape my course anew; And England's weal outweighs a woman's life. [Aside.] Nor. Should this affair fulfil its promises, We'll meet anon. Arun. If 't would assist you, sirs, Pray use my house. Ex. Yon fellow glows with zeal; He 'd stab she-CÃ¦sar in the capitol. [Aside.] [Exeunt severally.] SCENE IV. A By-street in London. Knots of vagabonds occasionally cross the scene. Enter Viscount Rochford and Thomas Wyatt. Rochford. Here is, indeed, a walk to take a friend, Good master Poet! Pray what place is this? Are we in London or in Tartarus? For, by my life, the visions we have passed Seemed fit induction to the place of shades. Wyatt. No, Heaven be praised, we are in âSafety.â sir; So call the thieves this well of girding walls. Here is a place as innocent of rule As the dun sands of savage Araby. Here pilferers divide their filchÃ©d rags, And bolder robbers share their golden spoils; Here crime is native, natural, unabashed, Walking abroad in easy confidence; Here treason stalks, the dreaded ghost of courts, Whetting his knife, and mixing deadly bowls. From yonder porch, I heard a hoarse-voiced Jew Harangue a crowd of frowning murderers, Cursing the king, the state, the holy church, Until he choked with mere malignity. On yonder steps, I saw a quiet wretch Coolly thrust in an ell or so of steel Between his brother's ribs.âThere they both walk, The Jew and murderer. No law is here, Save what the dwellers make, and that is shifting. I oft have thought the watchful eye of God Upon this place ne'er rested; or that hell Had raised so black a smoke of densest sin, That the All-Beautiful, appalled, shrank back From its fierce ugliness. I tell you, friend, When the great treason, which shall surely come To burst in shards law-bound society, Gives the first shudder, ere it grinds to dust Thrones, ranks, and fortunes, and most cunning lawsâ When the great temple of our social state Staggers, and throbs, and totters back to chaosâ Let men look here, here in this fiery mass Of agÃ©d crime and primal ignorance, For the hot heart of all the mystery!â Here, on this howling sea, let fall the scourge, Or pour the oil of mercy! Roch. Pour the oil,â In God's name, pour the blessed oil! The scourge, Bloody and fierce, has fallen for ages past Upon the foreward crests within its reach; Yet made no more impression on the mass Than Persia's whips upon the Hellespont. Wyatt. 'T was not to harrow up your heart with crimeâ Though, haply, such amazement is not lostâ I brought you hither. 'T was to stand beyond The utmost pale and influence of the Court, Where men interpret a malignant mind From every look the changing features wear; Find danger in the meeting of two friends; Rank treason in devices of our arms; Open rebellion to their gracious king, Should we but furbish our time-rusted blades. Now, Rochford, listen. Roch. Heavens! you frighten me. Wyatt. No, I but caution you. My tale, though sad, May rest on fears as thin as summer clouds. Roch. Why, that is cheering. Wyatt. 'T is not for yourself, But for her sacred majesty, the queen, I have these vague misgivings. Roch. What, the queen! Pshaw! Wyatt, was there ever woman blessed As she is? Courted and bepraised by all, Sharing no empty title in the crown, No mere producer of a royal brood; But by the force of her own intellect, To all effects, an equal with the king. Why, man, just now she stands at zenith height, Flooding our land with peerless majesty, The gaze and wonder of all Christendom. The great reformer, Anne, preÃ¶rdained By Heaven to work its solemn purposes!â Poh! this is idle; we are wasting time; Your fears, indeed, were thin as summer clouds. Wyatt. Ah! know you not, when the rejoicing sun Has reached its mid-day station in the sky, At that same time its mournful fall begins? Roch. Sir Poet, I confess me figure-beaten: Now croak away. Wyatt. What I shall tell, My sister Mary told to me alone. She says, of late her majesty remains, Hour after hour, with dull and vacant eyes, Picking the fringe around her garment's hem. Anon, big tears, like slow-paced mourners, come Forth from the darkened mansion of her grief, As if they followed at hope's funeral. If they arouse her from this lethargy, She looks bewildered, asks the time of day, Appears surprised at lateness of the hour, Gives more commands than she has several hairs; Talking, meanwhile, at such a rattling pace, In bitter sneers and heartless gayety, That not an ear can gather her discourse; And then again, all suddenly, she falls Into her former state of revery. Roch. Good sir, you startle me. You 're sure of this? For 't is the dreamy torpor of the brain That oft foreshadows madness. Wyatt. Very sure; But 't is not madness. Listen, till the end. One day my sister entered suddenly, But unperceived, the chamber of her highness. Scarce had she crossed the threshold ere she saw, Rolled in a heap and crammed into a corner, The person of the queen. She stood amazed, Not daring to approach; and saw such grief, So absolute, so past all earthly bounds, So fiercely raging to pain's topmost pitch, That she shrank quivering to the ante-room. But there her ears made pictures to her eyes: Anon, she heard her clawing at the floor, Sobbing and wailing like a soul possessed: Then into one long, piercing, hellish scream Of hideous laughter broke her aching soul. At that my sister fled, with echoing laugh, And knew no more till from a lengthened swoon Her maids awoke her. Roch. This is past belief. Without a doubt, the queen or she is mad. Wyatt. My sister says, the king and queen ne'er meet; That notes unnumbered of her majesty's He has returned unopened. More, 't is noised, The king and Seymour's daughter oft of late Have been observed together; that the foes, Once secret, but now open, of the queen, Stand in high favor with his majesty, And share his private counsels. Roch. Gracious Heaven! If this be certain, there is more in it Than I dare utter. Have I been bewitched, That I remained o'er-confident so long? Now you have mentioned it, a thousand things Which I have seen, but shuffled by unweighed, Rise to confirm the gloomiest belief. My cold receptions, Suffolk's insolence, Arundel's vaporings, Norfolk's tart replies, My sudden dearth of courtly sycophants, And Wyatt's warming friendship. Noble man, Through all my life I never aided youâ Wyatt. Because I never asked it. Pshaw! George Boleyn, Were we not playfellows 'neath Blickling's oaks, Where first my muse essayed her feeble lisp? Did you not praise and wonder at my rhymes, And cheer my heart with kindred sympathy? Have we not written sonnets and rondeaux, In kindly rivalry, to Anne's eyes? Did you not always swear my songs the best, Ere half were read, and force fair Anne's hand To place the laurel on my victor brow? Can I forget you? Can I cease to see, In England's queen, our little playfellow? Forgive me, Rochford; this is not a time To babble of our childhood. You are hemmed With scores of bold and ruthless enemies; And, God forgive him! the worst foe of all Is the first man in England's wide domain! Roch. What shall be done? Wyatt. Fly to her majesty; Drain to the dregs her secret cause of grief; Learn all her fears, the blackest of her fears, Nor care to know her dimmest gleam of hope. Armed for the worst, we gain a double strengthâ The power to conquer at the last extreme, And chance that such extreme may ne'er arrive. I will not slumber. What the brain of man Can summon from its viewless armory, Shall be arrayed to battle for her right. I'll see you safe beyond this wretched place, And then we part, but not without a hope. [Exeunt.] ACT III. SCENE I. A Tavern. Mark Smeaton, drunk, with Ralph Loney and three Informers seated at a table spread with wine, etc. Smeaton. Now, that 's a song, and that 's what I call singing. Roar it again, brave master bull-throat, roar! First Informer. [Sings.] Old sack, old sack, Thou hast a happy knack, When fortune deals a sorry thwack, When friends may flout and credit crack, Old sack, old sack. Old sack, old sack, We'll bide the world's attack, Though rosy Cupid turn his back, We ask but this, that thou 'lt not lack, Old sack, old sack. Smea. Is that the end of your rare melody? Loney, my boyâLoney, you are dull as mudâ Were you not ravished by yon fellow's song? That is the neat's-tongue of true poesy: Nature applauds it in the thirst it brings. The song is a miracle; that one being full Yet asks for more upon it. Wine, there, wine! [They drink.] What are such poets as my lord of Surrey, Or whining Wyatt?âSome one curse Tom Wyatt! You singer with the stormy lungs, pray curse This Thomas Wyatt! Have I ne'er a friend Whose oaths are potent? Curse him black and blue, My rival Wyatt! Lon. Rival, boy! and how? Smea. Who is my love? Answer me, leather-lungs. First I. Nay, sir, I know not. Smea. Then you are an ass, Not knowing, and a wizard, knowing her. Lon. We cannot miss by drinking her a round. Give us the toast. Smea. Here 's to our noble queen! [Drinks.] Lon. That 's good and loyal, and we'll quaff it off; But not what we intended. We would drink To your sweet darling, to your pretty May, Your wanton plaything. Come, boy, never halt! Smea. Loney, observe meâevery piece of meâ Edgewise, before, behind. Now tell me, sir, What woman in this realm is worthy of me? Lon. Some great one, without doubt. Smea. I say, the queen. Lon. Now mark him, sirs. [Apart to the Informers.] Informers. Ho! ho! the man is drunk! Smea. What do you take me for, you foul-mouthed knaves, A man of worship, or a common liar? Where have you lived, you scum of filthy earth, Not to know me? Lon. Pardon the simple men; Indeed they knew not of your dignity. This is her majesty's chief groom of stateâ The very front door to her royal ear; You must needs pass him ere you reach the queenâ Pray you, respect him. First I. O, that alters it; A royal servant. Smea. Are the villains blind? Well, well, I have comfort. Lon. What may comfort you? Smea. That some fair day a goodly son of mine May mount the throne, and chop off all their heads. Lon. Mark that again. [Apart to the Informers.] Second Informer. There is not a word escapes: I have engrossed it in my table-book. Smea. Come, Loney, come; we'll leave these stupid knaves. Second I. Whither away, sir? Smea. To the queen, good dolt! [Going.] Lon. Forget not, masters, âTo the queen,â he said; And at this hour. So, boy, away, away! [Exit with Smeaton.] Second I. There is hanging in this. Third Informer. Curse him! what care I? I nigh had struck the braggart down myself, For slandering thus her gracious majesty. The base, ungrateful cur! I'll see him hang. [Exeunt.] SCENE II. The Queen's Apartments in Whitehall Palace. Enter Queen Anne. Queen Anne. So this is day, a broad, sun-staring dayâ And what had it been night? the same, the same. All time to me is one confusÃ©d mass, Drowned in a flood of bitter misery. There is no time to one without a hope: Hopes are the figures on life's changing dial, That first betray to us the passing hours, Ere the great bell may summon us away. All blank and meaningless is life to me: I have no future. One eternal present, Rayless as Lapland winter, wraps my soul; One ceaseless wrong, affording but one sense Of cruelest agony, makes up my life, Stretching from day to day its sole event. What if the sun arise? what if the lark Put on the glory of his morning song? What if the flowers perk up their loaded heads, And swing their incense down the thirsting gale? What if the frame of the whole universe Warm in the glow, and join the matin hymn? While I remain in this dull lethargy, There is no morn to me. Eternal One, Who sent'st that joyous thing, the rising sun, As if in mockery of my sullen woe, To show how cheerless is my nighted soulâ O, end this mere existence! Rouse to life The fire of my consuming energies! O, give me scope, and fate-subduing powerâ Ay, though a pang be coupled with each actâ Lest, in this trance, the erring scythe of death Pass o'er my frame, as o'er the trampled grain, And nature be defeated! Gracious God, Are we mere puppets of a rigid fate? Is all this labyrinth of cunning thought Bestowed to snare us? Must our exit be Through that one door which destiny holds wide? To me alone, of all the human race, Has the dread secret clearly been revealed? It seems so; for where'er I bend my eyes Some ugly phantom bars the hopeless way, And bids me wait the will of circumstance. This shall not be! Arise, my drowsing soul! Gird on thy blazing arms of intellect! One struggle more to master coming time; And if thy earthly walls then fall consumed, We'll scale those heights where conquering time is not! (Enter Mary Wyatt.) Mary Wyatt. A fair good-morning to your majesty! Queen A. Welcome, sweet mistress Mary! Mary W. Joyful sight! There is a flush of triumph on your brow, Such as it wore on Coronation-Day, Or when the spleenful butcher met his fall. Queen A. Speak not of Wolsey. Mary W. Have I ruffled you? Queen A. O no, O no! to-day my heart is light. I feel as if another goodly crown Hung o'er my head. Mary W. Your brother, Rochford, waits. Since break of day he has been biding here. Queen A. Ha! what has happened? Mary W. Nothing that I know. Queen A. Well, well, admit him. (Exit Mary Wyatt.) Rochford, at this hour!â A man of ease; and waited here since dawn! My heart is failing.âNonsense! what can come, Worse than the vision of that weak-brained girl Locked in the circle of my husband's arms? (Enter Viscount Rochford.) Good-morrow, Rochford! You are stirring soon. Rochford. One stirs betimes who keeps a sleepless night. Queen A. Have you been ill? Roch. Indeed I cannot tell. Perchance a fever brought my waking dreams. Queen A. What dreams? Roch. I lay half slumbering, half awake, And ever, as my senses leaned to sleep, The same wild vision roused me from my rest. Queen A. So you came here, before the break of day, To tell your dreams? I am no soothsayer. Pshaw! Rochford, this is trifling. You have griefsâ Big, weighty griefs; I see them on your brow. Roch. First hear my dream: I swear, no common one, For you were mingled in it. Queen A. Well, say on. Roch. I thought that you and I, for years and years, Had climbed the rundles of a slippery ladder. I knew not why we clambered; though above A blazing halo, like a sunset sky, Shone glorious, and towards it we bent our steps, Urged by resistless impulse. You were first; And when I halted, by the labor tired, Or dizzy at the awful depth beneath, You cheered me on, and with your nimble feet Spurned the frail rounds, till sundered 'neath your tread They fell around me. Woful, woful sight! Each stick in falling to a ghastly head Was metamorphosed. Here, Queen Katharine's fell; There Wolsey's, More's, and Fisher's, spouting blood; And many a one whose face I could not catch. These, as they passed me, whispered in my ears A horrid curse, and grinned, and winked their eyes.â Queen A. Good heaven, how awful! Was there more of this? Roch. Ay, far more dreadful fancies. Queen A. Could there be? Roch. Already through the radiant clouds above Your form was piercing, when our frail support Shook till I sickened; and aloft I saw A dreadful shape, in features like the king, Tugging and straining with his threatening hand To hurl our ladder to the depths below. I saw you clutching at the dazzling clouds, That, unsubstantial, melted in your grasp; I heard you cry to the unpitying fiend Who held our lives in his relentless hands; I saw you turn on me one fearful look, In whose dread meaning desolate despair Had crowded all pale shapes of agony, Ere, with spasmodic catching at my breath, I shot down headlong.âWith the fall, I woke. Queen A. A fearful dream. Roch. A most connected one. The thing seems now an uttered prophecy, Whose power shall bend the neck of stubborn time To do its bidding. Queen A. Cheer up, Rochford, cheer! Some one has told you that his majesty Looks coldly on me. So has he before, When I have crossed him in his fiery moods. To-day, I mean to win him back again. I must confess I have been negligent, Not to have closed our matrimonial flaw. Roch. Sister, this levity is forced. I know That your proud soul has suffered keen chagrin; Nor in hope's sunshine stand you more than I. Jane Seymourâ Queen A. Nonsense, man, to place my worth Against the nothing of so weak a girl! The king's time lags; his ever-roving eye, Perchance his appetite, was caught by her: The eye soon tires, the heart is never full; The first is hers, the nobler prize is mine. Hope for the best. If I return to-day A conquered soldier, from this war of hearts, I'll give you leave to ease your sorry eyes O'er my afflictions. Roch. Joy be with you, sister! Your merry mood has stolen my fear away. [Going.] Yet what I have heardâ Queen A. Nay, what anon you'll hear! [Exit Rochford.] O, misery! to play this queenly part Even to my brother! To be so supreme That the sweet flood of human sympathy, In which the beggar's ragged form may lave, Can never touch me! This is royalty, To feel for all that have no sense for me: To have no kindred, no companionshipâ The lonely phÅnix on her spicy fire. Alone, alone! Kind heaven, the king remainsâ My rightful mate, sole partner of my lotâ And I will win him, though conspiring earth Turn all its dust to Seymours, and the land Sprout with such weedy beauties as this girl! [Exit.] SCENE III. Another Room in the Palace. Enter King Henry and the Duke of Norfolk. Norfolk. Admit the boastings of this silly knave Are merely grounded on his vanity: Yet these same boasts, converted to a charge, Would wear another aspect. King Henry. Very true; But 't is too horrible. Disclose a charge Less dyed in blackness, bearing yet a color Sufficient for divorce, but not for death. I do believe her a most faithful wife, Loving and true; though now her tenderness, Like healthy food to a distempered mouth, Disgusts the thing 't would nourish. Nor. I am dumb. I know no charge but what involves a crime As great as treason. For the lighter fault, Of secret correspondence with King Francis, We have no witness, and but scanty grounds To base our own suspicions on. King H. 'Ods wounds! Would I could rack the French ambassador! Is there no other way? Nor. None, that I know. King H. Then, in the name of all the lying fiends, Clear out this woman by what means you can! But mind you, sir, let there be proof enough To force conviction to the very core Of my own conscience. Nor. Ah! that tender conscience! [Aside.] Doubt not, my liege; the proof shall be direct. Suffolk has sent a follower of his, With three grave witnesses, most truthful men, To bring Mark Smeaton to that mellow state In which the tongue o'erleaps the sober will, And blusters out its secrets. Truth 's a fool, And drunkenness an artificial folly. King H. Now, by my soul, perchance the charge is true! Nor. Doubtless, my liege. Nor is the groom alone The only evidence may be produced. I have brought one, a deeply-injured wife, The good Viscountess Rochford; she awaits Your royal pleasure in the ante-room. King H. âThe good Viscountess Rochford!â Nor. She can tell Some wondrous matters to your majesty. King H. Go bring her up. (Exit Norfolk.) âThe good Viscountess Rochford!â If Hell were swept, to find its vilest soul, That soul would blush at sight of this good lady. (ReÃ«nter Norfolk with Viscountess Rochford.) Nor. I pray your majesty, be gentle with her. [Apart to King Henry.] King H. Welcome, my lady! Lady Rochford. Heaven protect your highness! King H. His grace of Norfolk says your ladyship Can tell some wondrous matters of the queen. Lady R. Not I, my liege. King H. 'Fore heaven! what brought you, then? Nor. Nay, draw her gently on. She must be led, my liege. [Apart to King Henry.] King H. Who are familiar with her majesty? Lady R. Why, Mary Wyatt, and sweet mistress Seymourâ King H. Zounds, woman!âand what men? Lady R. I know not all. Besides the Council, and the Churchmenâ King H. 'Sblood! And all my army, and my navy, too! Madam, you trifle with us; pray speak out: I swear no harm shall come, whate'er you say. What paramours has she? Nay, I command; Speak, if you love my honor. Lady R Doleful hour, That I was forced to see her wickedness; More doleful far, to tell it! Pray, my liegeâ King H. I'll have no faltering. Speak! or by high heaven, Look to yourself! Lady R. I am but a timid woman; You are my king, and may compel my tongue: But did not dutyâpardon what I sayâ King H. Enough, enough! Lady R. These are her paramoursâ Not fancied, but with certainty of proofâ Sir Henry Norris, William Brereton, Sir Francis Weston, master Thomas Wyattâ All proper men, all men of gallant partsâ King H. We'll spare your comments on the lady's taste. Lady R. But there 's Mark Smeaton, a low common knave, By virtue of her favor made a groom; And last of all, my husband, Viscount Rochford. King H. But he 's her brother. Lady R. All the worse, my liege. King H. Monstrous! The name that you reserved to crown The utter horror of this long-drawn list Throws a discredit on the whole device. Have you no enemy to name for him? Have you denounced them all? Lady R. I'll prove his guilt More clearly than the crime of any other. 'T was but this mornâ King H. For God's sake, take her hence! [Walks apart.] Nor. The king is satisfied. You may withdraw. You have pleased him, lady, more than he dare show. [Exit Viscountess Rochford.] King H. Must all these die? Nor. They all are mortal, sir; And our fair witness must have that agreed, Ere she impugn them. King H. Ay, her serpent mouth Would sooner spit its rancorous member forth Than bate one jot of its malicious spleen: But Wyatt shall not, Wyatt shall not die. We have had enough of executing scholars. Who ever heard such hubbub through the world As when Sir Thomas More was put to death? Herod and Pilate were crowned saints to me! Why, men that looked like moles, old dusty things, Came from their folios, leaving fear behind, And to my teeth talked of the infamy To which they 'd damn me.âWyatt shall not die. In my wide realm are herds of courtiers, Knights and viscounts, and gallant gentlemen; There 's but one Wyatt.âWyatt shall not die! [Exeunt.] SCENE IV. A Room in the Duke of Suffolk's Palace. Enter Duke of Suffolk. Duke of Norfolk, Marquis of Exeter, and Earl of Arundel, followed by Mark Smeaton and Ralph Loney. Norfolk. I tell you, fellow, you have not a hope, Save by agreeing to forswear the queen. Your guilty boastings, urged against yourself, Will bring you to the gallowsâ Arundel. Ay, and shall. Nor. Unless before the Council you appear, And there denounce your royal paramour. Smeaton. But will that save me? Nor. 'T is your only hope. Smea. But 't is a lieâa gross, atrocious lieâ And I am a villain if I uttered it. Curse on the wine! It was the babbling wine, And not my tongue, that forged the calumny. Suffolk. The boast you made was heard by witnesses, Who say you were but warmed, not drunk with wine. Smea. 'T is false, 't is false! Have mercy on me sirs! I am but an humble man, of no account; My death at this time, or a century hence, Could make no difference to such mighty lords. If noble mercy stoops not to the low, At least be just to me.â Arun. Cease, whining cur! The game we are playing is to check the queen; What care we for a pawn? Smea. She is innocent. The words I dropped were from a foolish whim, To see myself admired by simple men: I never thought to injure her, nor hear My harmless folly rigidly explained By noblemen. Ah! Loney, you did this; And 't is the foulest act you ever did, Though you have committed murder. Loney. Help yourself. Be not a double fool, first to get trapped, Then lack the art to burrow out of harm. Forget my deeds; they are my own concern; Nor stand there moralizing on the past. Seize on to-dayâperchance 't is golden, man. Smea. âPerchance, perchance!â but not one promise given, Even by you. Lon. The course they offer you Is bright with hope; despair and frightful death, By wrenching tortures and heart-shrivelling fires, Threaten you darkly from all other ways. I know your courage. When you have been racked For one short fortnight, or a month at most, You'll yield perforce. Why not confess at once, And gain the hope of pardon and reward? Pray did you ever see a felon racked, Even for an hour? Arun. Come, fellow, will you speak? Or shall I sound your carcass with my sword, To find your tongue? Exeter. The valiant gentleman! [Aside.] Smea. O, horror, horror! Have compassion, sirs! O my poor mistress! Is there not a handâ Now, while I shut my eyesâso merciful As to despatch me, and deliver her? She is my maker,âshe created me, From my vile dust, to be whate'er I am; As well might I blaspheme as stain her honor! Good sirs, have pity! Suf. Cease your agonies, You foul-mouthed slanderer of Heaven's majesty! Speak to the pointâwill you comply or not? Smea. But will that save me? Suf. Are we prophets, fool? What else can save you? Smea. But her majestyâ What will befall her? Nor. What is that to you? Have you the power to influence her fate? Arun. Are we the answers in your catechism, That you so glibly question? Smea. I will not! Suf. Loney, prepare the rack. [Exit Loney.] Smea. Forgive me, Heaven! I will do anything: but spare my life! O, this is awful! I, that never dared To touch her robe, or raise my fearful eyes To the full glory of her angel faceâ When her twin orbs of conquering majesty I felt upon meânow, with stubborn front, To stand before the gaze of frowning Heaven, And call its host to register a lie, A black, soul-killing lie! O, urge it not! There 's not an honest man, in England's realm, Who will not sicken at my perfidy, Or cram the falsehood down my caitiff throat Ere I half utter it! This is too foul, And useless for the end to which you urge it. Suf. Loney, the rack. (A curtain is drawn, and the rack disclosed, with Attendants standing near it.) Arun. Look there, Sir Constancy! There 's what shall move you, every joint and limbâ There 's what shall stretch you more than you'll stretch truth. You'll strain a point for thisâhey! hey! my boy? Smea. O, nerve me, Heaven!âuplift my faltering heart! Give me the strength to foil these sinful men, And here assert thy might! Arun. Away with him! [Attendants seize Smeaton.] Smea. I yield, I yield! Suf. Then sign this paper, Mark, And wait the issue. [Smeaton signs.] Ex. There an angel fell! Here is a wretch who damns his endless soul To save his mortal body. I had hoped, For the poor cause of frail humanity, To see yon fellow win a martyr's crown, And give the Calendar of our new creed Its first accomplished sainthood. [Aside.] Suf. It is done. Nor. In the king's name, Mark Smeaton I arrest For treason manifest. [Attendants seize Smeaton.] Smea. Is this your mercy? Suf. Traitor, no words! Away with him, away! [Exeunt.] SCENE V. An Apartment in Whitehall Palace. Enter King Henry. King Henry. How easy 't is to run an evil course! How many stubborn checks a virtuous meets! Sure all the fiends have turned them engineers, And smoothed the thousand pathways to their gulf, So quickly trod by man. There 's not a let, As far as reason's straining eye can pierce, To the career which sin points out for me. Jane daily warms; the queen grows proud and cold, Nor now besieges me with tender notes; My nobles leave her, all afire for me; And the most powerfulâay, her very kinâ Hatch plots to work her sudden overthrow. My love goes smoothly.âHum! and yet 't is strange, When not within the circle of my eyesâ That drink her beauties like the thirsting sands, And bear the hot thrill of her loveliness Into my very soulâhow this same fever, That fiercely glowed erewhile, calms and is cooled; How, in the place of sudden pangs and starts, And all unrest, a holy peace succeeds; When comes the shape of my much-wrongÃ©d queen, Crossing my mind in quiet majesty, And trampling on the dust of noxious fancies, That throng the long, long avenues of thought, As if of right she crushed my base desires! (Enter Queen Anne, behind.) Queen Anne. Henry. King H. Was that a spirit? Queen A. Husband, king. King H. How came you here? I left direct command That no one should disturb my privacy. Have you again been tampering with my knaves? Queen A. I came by a small passageâif forgotten By you, my liege, still to my memory dearâ Made by yourself, in that once happy time, When, unobserved, you came to woo âthe Boleyn.â Is there no secret passage, you can name, Through which so poor a one as I may creep Back to your heart, and see again the face Of hidden love? O, sir, it must be rough, And small, and frightful to a valiant gaze, But I will tempt it. King H. There is none for you. Your pride and haughtiness and stubborn will Are all too big for love's slight passages.â Now, by my faith, I am indeed amazed, To hear you pleading in this gentle tone. Have you forgot your character? Begin! Rail, like the thunders, at our guilty world! So ho! brave censor of morality, Embodied purity, untouched by earth!â What, are you pitiful? or have you sinned, And therefore feel compassion? Queen A. I have sinned, And tried the mercy of indulgent Heaven Beyond all bounds that human reason knows. I have been arrogant, to judge my kind By God's own law, not seeing in myself A guilty judge condemning the less vile. I have forgotten that the hand of death Would snatch the royal circle from my brow, And set me, but encumbered by my guilt, Equal with all, before the judgment-seat. I have forgotten mercy: so might God Forget His mercy in my utmost need. I haveâ King H. Hoot! madam; pray restrain yourself! I have no office to receive confessions. Yetâsince you force me to play ghostly fatherâ Is there no other sin, of grosser cast, By you committed, not towards Heaven alone, But to my honor? Queen A. 'T is a hideous lie! Who has abused your majesty's belief With such unworthy tattle? Did you stand And tamely hear your honor thus belied? I knew that I had enemies enough, Unscrupulous and cruel; but never deemed Such base, malicious, and unfounded charge Could move a human lip, or find an ear So used to gorging sickly mental stuff As to receive it. Try me, try me, sir. Wring every fibre of my woman's frame With piercing torturesâhold my modesty, In truth's keen sunlight, to the vulgar gazeâ Confront me crownless with my slanderers: If at the last my trial prove me clear, And reÃ¼nite our long-dissevered hearts, I'll hold the pain but lightly. King H. Pshaw! my child, You waste your energy. This base report Is the light mintage of some idle tongue, In want of truer metal. Queen A. Ah! my liege, I hold this shallow falsehood at its worth; But it afflicts me sadly, to behold Your easy method of avoiding it, Without a thought of punishing the wrong. How have I changed?âO, Henry, you have changed From that true Henry who, in bygone days, Rode, with the hurry of a northern gale, Towards Hever's heights, and ere the park was gained, Made the glad air a messenger of love, By many a blast upon your hunting-horn. Have you forgotten that old oaken room, Fearful with portraits of my buried race, Where I received you panting from your horse; As breathless, from my dumb excess of joy, As you with hasty travel? Do you think Of our sweet meetings 'neath the gloomy yews Of Sopewell Nunnery, when the happy day That made me yours seemed lingering as it came, More slowly moving as it nearer drew? How you chid time, and vowed the hoary knave Might mark each second of his horologe With dying groans, from those you cherished most, So he would hastenâ King H. Anne, that was you. Have you forgotten, too, my merriment At your quaint figure of time's human clock, Whose every beat a soul's flight registered? Queen A. God bless you, Henry! [Embraces him.] King H. Pshaw! why touch so deep? These softening memories of our early love Come o'er me like my childhood. Queen A. Love be praised, That with such pure reflections couples me! Be steadfast, Henry. King H. Fear not: love is poor That seals not compacts with the stamp of faith. Queen A. My stay is trespass. We shall meet anon. Love needs no counsel in his little realm. [Embraces him, and exit.] King H. I hang 't wixt heaven and hell.âAnne, return; For, by my soul, one half my virtuous strength Has gone with you! O, I would rather be The snarling cynic in his squalid tub, And master of myself, than England's king, Reared to indulgence of each flimsy whim That passion hints at. 'T is the curse of kings, This slaving to our pampered appetites; Which thwarted men nursed in vicissitude, And by compulsion taught to check desire, Gain strength to vanquish. (Enter Jane Seymour.) Jane Seymour. Harry, royal Harry! King H. Good-morrow, mistress Seymour. Jane S. Ha! so coldâ The queen just gone! I'll match you, whirligig. [Aside.] I crave your pardon, that with rude alarm I thus disturbed your gracious majesty, Seeking for one I nicknamed royal Harryâ Not meaning disrespect to you, my liege, But from a wanton fancy. Had I thought Your majesty here present, I 'd have held A stricter rein upon my noisy tongue. King H. Ah! she is beautiful. This little mood, Of mingled coquetry and tearful spite, Sits like the angry rain-drops on a rose, Giving fresh lustre to its crimson cheeks. [Aside.] You have my pardon. Jane S. Nay, I wish it not. Pray cast your pardon on a graver slip: Forgive the maiden greenness of a heart That prattled to itself a silly tale Of love, and hope, and thoughtless confidence, Even in your very presence. King H. Jane, what mean you? Jane S. But what my words imply. King H. And are you angry? Jane S. No, I am deceived. King H. Truce, truce, fair mistress! Jane S. Nay, peace is not my purpose. King H. Prithee stop! Jane S. You may be king of half the universe, For aught I care; you are not king of hearts: My heart shall speak, though every word cry treason! King H. Forgive my coldness. Jane S. Ah! I never deemed A truer spirit lived than yours, my liege: Else why did you, from your exalted height, Descend with flattering promises of love?â Only to make me wretched! O, 't is base! A brutal hind might show more constancy Than this anointed king. [Weeps.] King H. Nay, weep not, Jane. [Kneels.] See me thus lowly in my penitence. I swear I meant no insult to you, darling; And here, upon my knees, I once again Put on the easy fetters of my heart. Jane S. Swear fealty to love! Your fickleness Reproaches more your manly character, Than the poor wrong to meâ King H. I swear, by Heaven, Henceforth to love you with all constancy, By night, by day, in sunshine and in storm; Nor will I alter in my steadfast aim To crown you queen, though every mortal sin, That fiends can reckon in their calendar, Lie between me and my unfaltering wish! [Rises.] Jane S. This oath is fearful. King H. But irrevocable.â What ask you more? Jane S. O, sir, I asked not that: I but demand of you a bare return For the great venture of my woman's heart, Unhappily launched upon a sea of love, With you for careless pilot. 'T is my all; Though you esteem the charge of little worth. King H. Tut, tut, my darling! if our hearts respond, Our windy tongues are poor ambassadors To bear their gentle greetings. Love is dumb, A potent spirit, felt, but never heard, Save when he murmurs inarticulate 'T ween meeting lips, or buzzes wild conceits, That mock the language of our grosser sense, In lover's brains. Words are love's counterfeits: When stumbling fools would ape a shallow passion, Lies slide full glibly, and false rhetoric, Lashed to a foam, roars opposition down, And for effect kills feeling. Rail no more; Or I shall doubt that sweet sincerity On which I live. Jane S. O, never doubt my faith. King H. Nor will I. (Embraces her.) I will bar my pliant ears Against the witchery of sly Anne's tongue: Her airy magic cheats my spell-bound heart, And for a moment shows a fancied spot, Bright with the May-day flowers of early love, Amid December's snow. And now for Norfolk. Jane S. Nothing in haste, my liege. King H. No; all in love. [Exeunt. ACT IV. SCENE I. The Lists at Greenwich, prepared for a Tournament. Flourish. Enter King Henry, Queen Anne, Lords, Ladies, Attendants, Men-at-arms, etc. The King and Queen seat themselves under the cloth of state. Then enter the lists Viscount Rochford and other Knights, as Challengers, with Heralds, Squires, Pages, etc. Trumpets sound a challenge. To them enter Sir Henry Norris and other knights, as Defenders, with Attendants, etc. Flourish. Rochford, Norris, and their respective Knights, engage. Norris and his party are driven back. Queen Anne. I pray your highness, let them breathe a while; Their sport grows earnest. Ill may come of this: Rochford is dangerous when his blood is up. King Henry. Poh! poh! mere bruises. Would you rather see Rochford or Norris wounded? Queen A. Neither, neither!â Good sir, 't is frightful. King H. Ha! so kind to both? Then love admits not of relationship. Queen A. Sound, herald, sound! (Trumpets sound a retreat, and the combat ceases.) King H. Now, by the holy rood! [Starts up.] If we were speechless, Heaven had been most kind In sending one to exercise our function. Queen A. I feared, my liegeâ King H. O, this is nothing new: You have governed England, me amongst the rest, Since God knows when!âYou thing of painted cloth, When next you blow without your king's command, Look to your tabard.âIs our queen our tongue? [Queen Anne, in her terror, drops her handkerchief. Norris picks it up, kisses, land returns it.] Monstrous, by Jove! What, in our very presence!â Shameless adulteress! Let the tilt be stopped! We are as patient as most ill-used men, But this we cannot bear. Set on, before! Was ever king thus openly defied? [Exit with Courtiers] Queen A. O! horror, horror! [She faints, and is borne off.] Rochford. Norris, did I hear? Or am I singled from among you all, To bear the terrors of this fantasy? Norris. Alas! your senses serve too faithfully: Would I could doubt you sane! (Enter Thomas Wyatt, hastily.) Wyatt. Fly, Rochford, fly! And you, Sir Henry Norris, if you 'd live. Nor. I fly! and wherefore? Wyatt. Ask not, but awayâ Away to Scotland; nor till every inch Of English ground has vanished from your sight, Draw rein or spare the spur! Roch. O! I am stunned With mere intensity of present grief; No after blow, that cuts my torpid soul Loose from its clay, can bear a pang for me! I will not fly to live. I have beheld A sight to force me into league with deathâ The most unkingly, meanest, foulest deed That brother's eyes e'er saw. Wyatt. Now 't is too late. (Enter an Officer and Guard.) Officer. Lord Rochford and Sir Henry Norris, yield; I do arrest you for high treason, sirs. Give up your arms, and follow to the Tower. Roch. Yes, yes. Come, Norris; for I make no doubt What was our virtue has become our guilt: Love to the queen is treason to the king. When the great fall the little must be crushed. Nor. Wyatt, what means this? I accused of treason! Wyatt. Ay, 't is a royal charge! Nor. Ha! say you so? Had you this order from his majesty, Or from the Council? [To the Officer.] Offi. From the king direct. Come, gentlemen; my office stands in peril By my indulgence to you. Roch. Farewell, Wyatt! Nor. My lord, be not down-hearted. This affair Will soon blow over. Roch. Yes, to other men; But I much fear that on my latest day It will have reached its climax. Offi. Come, sirs, come! Wyatt. Heaven send your innocence a quick release! Roch. With death to bear the warrant. [Exeunt Rochford, Norris, Officer, and Guard.] Wyatt. So I fear, Doomed victims of a ruthless tyranny. O, coming shape of English liberty, Have my desires played wanton to mine ears; Or do I hear the faint prophetic sound Of thy approaching footsteps echoing through The mists of coming time? Ye noble souls, Grim heroes of the field of Runnymede, Showing more glorious in your iron arms, On peaceful deeds, than in successful warsâ Inspire the souls of your too slothful race! Must all the liberty your courage won Slip from the hands to which you rendered it; Till the supineness of our base neglect Sink us to slaves? Is there no man aliveâ No heaven-marked hero, from the people sprungâ To lead the roaring multitudes of earth Along the fated pathway they must tread,â Ay, though they cross the throne, and trample out The sacred name and dignity of king? Has man no rights but what a tyrant doles?â No fate above his will? no claim on justice? Then doth God wrong His own dread sovereignty, And free us from allegiance. And she has fallen, Sole star amid this night of tyranny! How low I know not; but what eye e'er saw The falling star remount and shine again? I feel my weakness to support her cause, Against this pampered monster of a kingâ This frightful idol of the people's will, Throned on the superstitious reverence Of the poor fools that glut his savage maw. O, what a curse to have an honest heart, Hemmed in and cramped by the fixed frame of things, That, were it free, might move the stubborn world, And hang its glories on the brow of time! [Exit.] SCENE II. A Room in the Palace of Whitehall. Enter King Henry. King Henry. Too late, too late! I charged her openly; The issue now lies between her and me, And not between her innocence and guilt. I am a villain, or the queen is false, Since I became accuser of her truth: If she escape conviction, on the crown Descends the infamy of calumny, And through our person England will be shamed Before the jealous powers of Christendom. So, so! we owe it to our people, then, To prove our charge, or by conviction sure Seem to attest it.âThis is plain enough. Besides, in what regard stands common life Before our kingly honor? Julius said That CÃ¦sar's wife must be without a taint; And, but suspecting, put Pompeia by.â Wise CÃ¦sar! 't was a solemn precedent That kings should follow. Wherefore halt I now? A limping purpose never reached its mark, Though justice pointed. Should her guilt be proved?â Should an impartial court of noble peers Condemn her too? O, woful, woful thought! How shall I pardon her gross treachery? Their candid verdict will stop pity's ears, And force conviction to my doubting mind. She shall have trial, fair and open trialâ No honest men would wrong the innocent; And if they do?âher blood but swells their crimes; I escape stainless. (Enter Sir Henry Norris in custody of Officer and Guard.) Officer, withdraw; But stand in hail. (Exeunt Officer and Guard.) Ah! Norris, Henry Norris, You have abused that open confidence In which we held you. Norris. I! and how, my liege? King H. Nay, strive not, sir, to hide your secret guilt With artful candor and affected starts. Sin can put on the guise of innocence; Nor ever cheats us with its ugliness, But with its seeming beauty. Nor. On my life, I know not to what sin your tongue directs. King H. Have you not wronged me? Nor. Wronged your majesty! King H. Yes; have you not, to swell your amorous triumphs, And make yourself an envied libertine, Seduced the virtue of our fickle queen? Nor. Your grace is merry. [Laughing.] King H. Merry! are you mad? I say it can be proved. Nor. Proved! Set the hound That howled this lying folly in your ears Within the reach of my chastising sword, And if I send him not to fiery hell, With his foul tattle warm upon his lips, Rack me to powder! King H. Acted to the life! Nor. O, no, my liege; 't is but the natural heat That would boil over every English lip, To hear their queen traduced. King H. Be calm, Sir Harry. So much we hold the honor of our realm Before the vengeance due to private wrongs, That we have vowed to bury our own grief, And grant free pardon to whatever manâ Even though he were her fondest paramourâ Will fix the crime upon her guilty head. Nor. I am not he. I thought, until this hour,â Ay, and still think, and will, despite report,â Our queen as loyal to your majesty As the chaste moon is to her regal sun, Drinking no other beams. What though she shine Upon the darkness of our grateful earth, To cheer the spirits of night-foundered men?â That which she gives, she borrows from yourself; Fruitful to her, but, when it falls on us, The calm, cold splendor of reflected light. King H. Norris, beware! you carry this too far: If you confess not, instant, shameful death Awaits your stubborn spirit. Nor. Be it so: I'll rather add a thousand stings to death, Than give one pang to suffering innocence. King H. Then be it so, you contumacious boy! Have I embraced you in my trusting heart, To be denied when I demand return? Nor. Ha! do I hear? What saw your majesty, Even in so poor a man as Henry Norris, To make you hold me for a supple tool To work your bloody purpose? You must go A step below a knight and gentleman, To find a villain fitted to your wish. King H. Poh! poh! coy virtue, is it villanous To show obedience when your king commands? Nor. Is there no power in every honest breast, Above the terrors of your threatening will, 'Neath whose fixed look my guilty memory Shall cower in horror? King H. You must do this deed.â Nay, I adjure you. Nor. O, my gracious liegeâ King H. No words, no words! Nor. Avaunt, damned hypocrite! I here defy your utmost reach of wrath: The cruelest death, your wickedness can shape, Would be a joy to what you offer me. Stretch your base tortures through all coming time, And in the end they can but kill my clay; But you would turn my hand to impious use, And make me, like a frantic suicide, Stab at the life of my eternal soulâ That, by God's blessing, shall outlast your hate, And reign triumphant when your crown is dross! King H. Hold, villain, hold! or I will let the breath Out of your treacherous body! [Draws.] Nor. Do, my liege, And join assassination to the crimes That blot your monstrous heart.âI will not hold: I see you are bent upon destroying me, And, as a reckless man, I'll know your worst. O, woe to England, when this sinful king, Grown hard in crime, shall reach the fearful height That evil points him! Then shallâ King H. Brazen traitor! Dare you invoke our vengeance on your head? Without, there! (ReÃ«nter Officer and Guard.) See your prisoner to the Tower. If he escape, you 'd better hang yourselves Than live to tell it. Out, malignant traitor! [Exit Sir Henry Norris, in custody of the Guard.] O, the ingratitude of fickle man! The shifting sand that tumbles in the tide, Taking new form from every wanton surge, Is not more changeful than his rootless heart. He is a bark upon an angry sea, Unballasted, yet ever crowding sail; Careening now to passion's fiery gust, Now to the other side prostrated flat By self-styled reason's icy hurricane; Yet never sailing on an even keelâ Ever extreme, and no extreme the best. Who that had seen the favors I have showered, As thick and prodigal as Spring's warm sun, Upon the head of that remorseless wretch, Could have foreknown the desert barrenness Of his rude heart!âPah! I am sick of it. O, the ingratitude of wicked man! [Exit.] SCENE III. The Queen's Apartments in the Palace. Queen Anne and Mary Wyatt. Queen Anne. No audience, said you? Mary Wyatt. None, your highness, none. Queen A. But are you sure his majesty refused To read my letter? Mary W. Very sure; or whence The new-sprung insolence of every groom? They passed me by, for nigh a weary hour, Without observance. When at length I spoke, Demanding audience in your highness' name, They almost thrust me from the ante-room, With taunts and sneers. One knave, a malpert page, By you presented to his majesty, Said, with his arms akimbo, in a style That mimicked the king's bearing, âMistress Mary, When we desire to know of blubbering spells, At your sad corner of our merry house, We'll come to seek them;âtill that time, adieu!â At this his fellows grinned, like tickled apes, And winked, and leered at me; till I, abashedâ More that such things were human, than for fear Of any shame their insults might provokeâ Came sadly here, my mission unachieved. Queen A. I blame you not: I trusted in your zeal. Knowing its failure set all hope aside Save that which harbors in myself. Must I Again go begging for his chary love, After the public shame he put me to? Must I go whimpering like a stricken curâ I who am wronged, and should demand redressâ And pray, in mercy to my feebleness, This blow may be the last? Degrading thought! Were I the housewife of his lowest clown, Caned to obedience by a drunkard's hand, My woman's heart has in it pride enough To burst ere bear this last humility. Mary W. If pity move himâ Queen A. Pity! there 's a shame, More fearful in its furious rebuke, That follows threatening on the heels of wrongâ An earthly hell in which the conscience writhes, And lashes round its fiery barrier, Till suffering purify the tortured soul;â This he must feel, ere meek-eyed Pity's hand Will ope the silver gates of penitence, And through forgiveness show the way to peace. Mary W. O, may he feel it! Queen A. Feel it! he is human. Mary W. Yes; but before some heavier injury Make pity useless. Queen A. Pray, speak plainly, girl! I see your heart is full with mystery. What new misfortune is about to fall? Mary W. None, as I hope. Queen A. Nay, this is churlishness: You have some secret that may profit me. If I am ignorant of coming ills, How shall I guard me with expedients Against their wrath? The man by death assailed Is last to know the danger he is in. I make no doubt, but half the palace lackeys Have drawn a surer presage of my fate, From buzzing rumor, could more truly tell What will befall me for a year to come, Than I, with my own lot to outward seeming Within my grasp, could compass by design. So hangs our fate upon the breath of all, That oft a rumor shapes the destiny Of feeble wills. Mary W. 'T would but fatigue your ears, Not profit you, to hear the thousand woes That fools predict upon your majesty: But there 's much comfort in the croak of folly. Queen A. O, merely thus? naught in particular? Well, let them rail; the gale is adverse now, I must expect this dash of saucy spray Full in my face: anon the wind will change; Then they'll come tripping to my very heels, Sparkling with joy, and glad to decorate My rearward path. Mary W. Heaven guard your cheerful mind! Queen A. Actions begun in cheerfulness display The merry herald that foreruns success. The smile that lights an earnest countenance Seems as a gleam from some vast mental fire That burns within, and ever flashes out, Like tropic lightning on a summer night; Harmless, indeed, yet hinting of a power That, moved to wrath, might shake the seated earth To sulk at sorrow dulls the edge of will, And half unfits us for prosperity; Much more for danger, where each faculty That gives us sway is needed at its full. Mary W. When took your highness to philosophy? Queen A. Ha! you malicious elf! When heavy griefs First leaguered my poor heart, through it I found A path to wander from perplexing fears That lost in speculation dismal self. Sorrow makes many a deep philosopher. Mary W. Great minds may carry a great load unbowed. Ah, me! it brings me to my woman's part, To hear these strains of sweet philosophy Rise from her injured spirit. (Aside, weeping.) Sure the God Who suffers mischief to afflict you thus, Gives you the strength to bear it. Queen A. Doubtless, doubtless. (Enter Thomas Wyatt.) Mary W. My brother, please you. [Retires.] Queen A. Ah! good master Wyatt, What news abroad? Why do you shake your head? Why wear that funeral face? It seems to me That all my friends would plunder me of grief. Came you alone? Where are my other friends? Wyatt. Gone with the summer flies. The day is dark; And they that erewhile revelled in your light, Now sluggish hide in close obscurity, And prophesy of falling weather soon. Queen A. But Rochford? he is true in sun or shade. Wyatt. Ay, by my soul! And know you not? Queen A. Not I. Wyatt. Indeed?âThat I should bear the intelligence! Queen A. These dread inductions to ill-omened news, Pitch swift imagination far below The heaviest fact. Out with it, tender sir! What ever saw you like a fear in me? Wyatt. Lodged in the Tower. Queen A. A prisoner! on what charge? Wyatt. A charge as common now as larceny,â High treason. Queen A. Treason! who is loyal, then? O! what a shallow matter for arrest! Poor Rochford!âThis is strange.âHow bears he it? Wyatt. As innocence e'er bears calamity,â Suffering in body, but content at heart. Queen A. I'll to the king. Are not my wrongs enough, But that my foes must vex my kindred too? For Rochford's sake, I'll quell my stubborn pride, And ask the justice I deny myself. Wyatt. Ah! would you might! See you yon sentinel Who counts his steps along the corridor? That knave has orders from his majesty, On no account to let your highness pass. Queen A. Good sir, what augurs this? I feel it hereâ Here at my heartâa quaking like the step Of some advancing doom. 'T is terrible, To be environed by an enemy Whose very aims are hidden. Give me light! O, Wyatt, show me but my coward foes, Though they are numberless as Egypt's plaguesâ Let me but see the weapons in their hands, Though they can daunt the angry Thunderer, And I'll confront them! But to be assailed By arrows that seem raining from the cloudsâ To see my tribe, like Niobe's, cut down, Nor know what time my breast may be transfixedâ To feel myself the cause of all this woe, Without the chance of offering stroke for stroke, Is next to madness! Wyatt. All I know is this,â Lord Rochford, Norris, Brereton, and Weston, As the most noted followers of your highness, Have been arrested, charged with secret treason. In what particulars their guilt consists, Even wakeful rumor has not been informed; Nor are the prisoners wiser than the world. That popinjay, Mark Smeaton, too, has had Some private hearings in the council-room, After a tampering which he underwent At Suffolk's house. Queen A. No more of him;âhe 's harmless. All these brave hearts to suffer for my sake! O! deadly cowards! to remove these props, Whose sturdy valor might have long upheld Even the structure of a tottering cause! Wyatt. Whatever scheme your enemies have formed, Is now converted to a state affair: Your highness therefore must expect a blow, Not from lords Suffolk, Norfolk, and their friends, But from the Council. Queen A. Let them only come! My heart is aching to begin the fray: I vow, the conquered shall not fight again! What of the king? Wyatt. His majesty is silent, Gloomy and sad, and given to muttering; Flying at pleasures with an eagerness That crushes out the dainty soul of joy: As one a cup of rich, untasted wine Might crack with furious bacchanalian haste, And spill its fruity treasures. Queen A. So I thought: His love is wrestling with an agony, By fancied justice thrust upon his mind. When through this fire of malice I have passedâ Whose purifying ordeal he allows, Only to prove the temper of my heartâ Look, Wyatt, look to see my enemies, Drossy with crime, hurled headlong in the flame, To show the baseness of their earthy souls! Kings should be just. Wyatt. Ay, should be just. Queen A. How now? Would you arraign his royal qualities, Because my foes have led his mind astray With seeming justice? Ah! be careful, sir, Not to malign him, in your zeal for me! Wyatt. She hugs her ruin. (Aside.) Mistress Seymour saysâ Queen A. Out, wizard, out! Dare you to summon up The horrid phantom that pursues my steps, And ever shadowy flits before my eyes, Veiling the sun, and deepening deepest night? O! Wyatt, Wyatt, would you mock me too? O! would you rend the feeble barrier That hides my anguish from the gaping world, And show me in my naked wretchedness, Without a rag of pride to cover me, For prying fools to carp on? Cruel leech, To probe this wound, even though my tortured heart Might work salvation out of agony! Begone, begone! Wyatt. I meant notâ Queen A. I forgive you. Go, go, in mercy! If you love my health, Never again recall that fearful name! [Exit Wyatt.] 'T is hard, 't is hard!âbut it must be endured. O! vanished peace, that with my girlish hours Shook hands and parted, as they proudly strode Down the dark paths of untried womanhoodâ Return, return! Ah! couldst thou bring again Those pleasant days, when at the source of life My spirit sat, and heard, with nature's tones, The blended music of a higher life Mix and flow on in one grand harmony; When every sense, content with what it felt, Longed not for action, never-ending action, That once embraced makes us its slaves till death. Death, death! There is more sweetness in that name Than I e'er knew of. Does thy pallid hand Unite the two extremes of human life, Linking our earliest with our latest days, In one unbroken circle? Art thou she, The meek-faced peace of childhood, changed in name, But undistinguished in thy quality, Come from afar to lead us back again From where we started? Ah! I know not now, Nor can I till I pass, beyond recall, The narrow lintel of the voiceless grave.â O God! O God! I am weary of the day! [Scene closes.] SCENE IV. Another Room in the Palace. Enter King Henry and Jane Seymour. King Henry. Poh! 't is too late for pity. Jane Seymour. Pity, sir! I feel no pity for her wantonness: 'T is for yourself, so wickedly abused, So unsuspecting till the common voice Thrust its belief in your reluctant ears. The hand of justice is in everything: How strange it was our budding love put forth Just as her impious crimes had reached their full! Showing how Heaven may visit secret guilt In an avenging form of innocence, That sadly marvels at its own result. King H. Yes, very strange. Jane S. What proof can be produced? A mind so subtle in committing sin, Must be adept in masking stratagems. King H. That 's Norfolk's part. His grace has pledged himself To bring more evidence before the courtâ Uncircumstantial, downright, stubborn proofâ Than it will hear. And let him look to it: For if his charge prove slander to our queen, And she escape, untainted in her fame, I'll hang him like a thiefâby Heaven, I will! Jane S. Sweet hypocrite! (Aside.) But if his charge be proved? King H. Our realm has laws; too much we honor them, To stand between the culprit and their doom. Talk not of this. Jane S. Here comes the noble duke, Sending a smile before his onward path To ask a welcome. (Enter Duke of Norfolk.) Norfolk. All looks fair, my liege. King H. Looks foul, I say! Cannot I teach you, sir, That this discovered treachery of the queen Irks me to credit? Is it not enough That the dear honor of my father's throne Is sullied in the eyes of Christendom, And I am made the laughing-stock of time, Without this giggling at my sorry plight? Nor. A virtuous mood! (Aside.) Pardon the clownish haste That has disturbed your majesty's deep grief. You set me to pursue a wily chase; And if I feel the huntsman's eager flushâ More from pursuit than wish to strike my gameâ The heat of triumph should excuse my air. King H. Well, well, what news? Nor. So ho! king weathercock! [Aside.] I fear 't is too much for your majesty To hear the worst confirmed. King H. Ha! say you so? For to drift on upon a level sea Of settled woe, is better than to toss Between the heights of my delusive hopes And the deep gulfs of bottomless despair. Rest, Norfolk, rest from my o'erwhelming thoughts, Even in a port of quiet wretchedness, Would be a pleasure to this storm-tossed soul. Nor. I 'd give a barony for one free laugh. [Aside.] There is not a circumstance nor shade of proof, By law demanded to convict the queen, But I can summon to outface her tongue. This is blunt truth, ungarbled by a phrase To smooth its meaning in a dainty ear; And though you shrink, your royal dignity Calls out for vengeance on her traitorous head. King H. Be well prepared: your life hangs by a thread. Nor. I see your snares, sceptred duplicity; I am fairly entered, far beyond retreat; I know the issue is her death or mine. Thank Heaven, I do not need fear's ragged spur To drive me onward in my willing course. [Aside.] Trust to my zeal; I hold my sovereign's honor Above the selfish dread of common death. King H. What of this spinnet-player? Nor. Ah! the knave! He wavered sadly since his first confession: Now he 'd confirm the paper which he signed, And now he 'd suffer death ere swear to it. When strict imprisonment had cowed his mind, I by persuasion won him to my wish. King H. By what persuasion? Make no promises; The wretch shall hang. Nor. O! merely by the rack. King H. Most delicate inducement! Nor. Yes, my liege, It oft unclasps the rigid jaws of guilt. The pangs of death have many a time disclosed The murderer's secret; and the rack can bring A dying anguish, without fear of death. 'T is a most potent questioner. Jane S. My liege, Pray come away; for I am sick at heart, Hearing details so awful. Please, your grace, To keep such horrors for your private thoughts. Come, Henry, come! King H. To please you, love. Adieu, Good Norfolk; slack not in your zealous care. Nor. Heaven keep your majesties! Jane S. Pshaw! trifler. [Exeunt King Henry and Jane Seymour.] Nor. âPshaw!â But did I tickle you, my demi-queen? So delicate, so royal in your tastes! Cannot endure the thoughts of brutal racks; And yet would kill a queen to wear her shoes! 'Sdeath! when you are crowned, our manly swords must rust, Butchers lose traffic, and your tender court Browse, like Assyria's king, on bloodless weeds;â Ay, but our daggers shall be kept on edge, To stab our kind! Well, you are happily matched: A squeamish king who circumvents two lives, To urge his purpose to its bloody end, Vowing that justice shall have one of them, And a meek queen who shudders at the means, Yet at the end grapples with furies' claws. You crocodiles can blubber o'er your prey, If a stray infant should fall overboard, And cry that drowning is a sorry thing, Ere you together gorge it! What a life, So comforting to conscience, you may lead When Hymen yokes you!âDamn hypocrisy! (Enter Thomas Wyatt.) Wyatt. So say I too, under your grace's oath. Nor. Ha! ha! Sir Poet, 't was a pious oath. Wyatt. Of sure fulfilment. Nor. Pray what brings you here? Wyatt. A moth to light, a poet to a prince; Thus is it ever. I would see the king. Nor. He just retired. Wyatt. 'T is but a small affair; I'll come again. Nor. Can I not aid you, sir? Wyatt. I merely wished to see a prisoned rogueâ One fellow Smeaton, caged for stealing geese, Or some such matter. Has your grace a pass? The careless knave had my last madrigal, To set for music. 'T is my only copy; And if he is hanged, my immortality Loses a hope. Now, Reynard, play the fool! [Aside.] Nor. So, ho! my railer at hypocrisy, How smooth we lie! (Aside.) Confound this gosling thief! The king has orderedâwhy, I cannot sayâ That none, except the Council, shall have leave To see the fellow. Wyatt. Well, there is little lost. Nor. O, much, much, much! I honor poesy; And vow to succor your brave madrigal.â I'll make especial business of this matter. Wyatt. As deep as hell! (Aside.) Nay, trouble not yourself; Perchance the knave, among his prison griefs, Has lost remembrance of my trifling song. Nor. I will refresh him. 'T would amaze you, sir, To know how much I reverence your art. Each genuine poet, in each poem, forms What neither he nor any other man, Though he were equal in capacity, Can shape again. The moods of poets' minds Are, like the colors of chameleons, Seen in the same particulars but once. That combination of your shifting thoughts, Which you have pictured in a madrigal, Should make its due impression on our time. I would not see your chaplet lose a leaf:â Believe me, 't is a duty. Wyatt. Shrewd dissembler, With what a relish he pursues intrigues! [Aside.] I thank your grace, in poesy's sweet name, For this regard. Pray, can you tell me, sir, Upon what charge my friend, Sir Henry Norris, Will be arraigned? Nor. On many many, sir. The gravest, I believe, is robbing goose-ponds:â He is involved with Smeaton. Wyatt. Ah! indeed? 'T is an odd charge! But I observe of late How our good king takes the most famous geese, This realm produces, 'neath his royal wing. Adieu! your grace. [Going.] Nor. Ho! scion of the muse! I have a little scandal for your ear. Wyatt. For mine, your grace? [Returns.] Nor. Yes; 't is a trifling thing,â No greater in my eyes than songs in yours. They say you read too many madrigals In the attentive hearing of the queen. Look to it, sir: his majesty is loth His royal consort should give up her time To so much poetry. Wyatt. The sneering wretch! I dare not brave him, for her highness' sake. [Aside.] An idle rumor. Nor. But it put your songs In fearful jeopardy. The king nigh swore To hang all future poems by the neck, In your good person. He hates poesy. The royal opposition on this point Is stranger than the patronage of geese. Wyatt. 'Sblood! I must burst, if I remain to hear This cynic's gibes. (Aside.) Farewell! once more. Nor. Remember, No private readings to her majesty Of the lost madrigal, when I restore it. Wyatt. God shield the queen! for human aid is vain. [Aside.] [Exeunt severally.] SCENE V. The Queen's Apartments in the Palace. A table spread. Queen Anne, Maids, and Attendants, at the back of the scene. Queen Anne. (Advancing.) Ah, me! what fearful difference 't is, to view The self-same object unattained, and won! For memories are the shadows of our hopes, That ever lengthen as our day declines, Till death's oblivion wraps them both in night. When, from the lowly vale of common life, Ambition points us to the sunny tops Of the great hills of power, whose even sides, Ascending smoothly through the golden haze, Appear like stepping-stones from earth to heavenâ Ah! who could tell the peril of the road That must be braved to reach their eminence? What stony pathsâwhat thorny barriersâ What humble crawling under threatening rocksâ What dizzy ledges, wooing nerveless fear To swift forgetfulnessâwhat hungry chasms, That picture death within their roaring jaws, And stagger reason on his solid throneâ Must be o'erpassed, ere on the toppling heights, Amidst the region of perpetual storms, We stand alone in chill supremacy! (Enter Thomas Wyatt.) Quick, Wyatt, quick! have my poor friends a hope? Wyatt. But in the mercy of your enemies, Or the most tardy justice of the king. Queen A. Is this your zeal? O, apathetic man! Can you see Rochford, noble, loyal Rochfordâ Your friend, your playmateâone who ever bore His gathering honors with such humbleness That my hot pride has chid himâcan you see George Boleyn pining in a dreary cell, While May's warm sunshine fills the universe? Bethink you, Wyatt, of those faithful men, Weston, and Brereton, and Henry Norris, Whose days, like fetters, gall their manly souls, In the cramped limits of a prison-house, While you are slack to free them! Wyatt. Gracious Heaven!â Queen A. Deeds would be better, sir, than windy oaths. Lend me your manhood for a little day, And, by my soul, I'll breach their prison doors, Or light a blaze in England that shall scare These skulking enemies of theirs and mine Into a frenzy! Heaven can testify How much it grieves me that their doleful fate Seems woven with the tissue of my own! For, were it not, their wrongs would muster friends, And Heaven would launch an angry squadron down To succor virtue such as they possess. But IâO, God! I stand here all alone, Shunned by mankind, and tossed by careless chance To glut the appetite of enmityâ A helpless woman, full of wrongs and grief, With nothing left me but the conscious power By which the guiltless bear their martyrdom! Wyatt. O, woful day! Queen A. Have you but vain regrets? Wyatt. Hear me, your highness. Queen A. Words, and nothing more! Has innocence no power? has justice fled The side of right? or is it mere romance, To prate with poets of a heavenly might That nerves the weakness of a righteous cause? Fie! dreamer, fie! Wyatt. I ask you not to laud My wakeful labor, day and night bestowed, Without a thought of safety for myself, Upon this hopeless matter; all I ask Is thankless justice for a pure intent. I grant my efforts were of no availâ I grant some other and more skilful hand Might have achieved a work beyond my power; But yet, believe, all intellectual strength, All hidden cunning, and all bold resource, That nature gave me, were employed in vain Ere I despaired. Queen A. What was this mighty work? Had you the labor of a Hercules, That you so groan? Upon my life, I think This wondrous malady will heal itself Without your aid.âShake not your solemn head. The king still loves me:âI have faith in love. Wyatt. Ha! have you faith? then see my very heart. My memory reaches not that early day When I first loved you. Since remembrance threw The bright reflections of my childish thoughts Into the gloom of manhood's troubled hours, There is not a gleam, howe'er remote and dim, But owes its splendor to my love for you; There is not a hopeâ Queen A. Hold, traitor, on your life! Are you conspiring with my subtle foes? My maids observe us.âWould you ruin me? Is my last friend corrupted? Dare you, sir, Prattle this nonsense to your queen? O, base! Thus to presume on my defencelessness; Implying frailty which, a week ago, You had better died than barely hinted at! Wyatt. You thought me lukewarm. Queen A. No; I only meant To whet the edge of blunted zeal. [Noise without] Wyatt. How now? Prophetic fear! (Enter Duke of Norfolk, Duke of Suffolk, and other Lords of the Council, with Sir William Kingston and Guard.) Queen A. Good welcome, gentlemen! Bear you a message from his majesty? [A long pause.] What, not a word? Suffolk. We do. Queen A. Do what, your grace? Suf. Bear you a message from the king. Queen A. Ha! ha! [Laughing.] Your answer lagged so far behind my query, As quite to rupture sense. Norfolk. Come, Suffolk, come; No faltering now! [Apart to Suffolk.] Suf. The king has ordered us To see the person of her majesty Placed in your hands, Sir William, until he Makes such disposure of her as may suit His further pleasure. Queen A. Back, ye urgent tears; I'll never pay your tribute to my foes! [Aside.] If 't is the pleasure of his majesty To change my present lodgings for the Tower, Like a true subject, I obey. Wyatt. Brave, brave! Nature created thee from royal clay! [Aside.] Kingston. I will await your highness' preparation Queen A. I need none, sir. Nor. Away, away, Sir William! Queen A. Well said, good uncle. [Exeunt all but Wyatt.] Wyatt. Now, were I a beast, And Norfolk but another, I would tear The bitter heart out of his spiteful breast! But as a manâO, as a gentleman, A Christian gentlemanâI thank his grace That he allows my littleness to crawl 'Neath God's own light, and fret my weary soul With gazing on his huge monstrosity! What next? what next?âDivorce! And then, poor queen, She'll sit her down, like injured Katharine, And feed her heart with sorrow, till the bane Of cankering grief has poisoned every spring That pulses life along her shattered frame; And then she'll lapse, by scarce perceived degrees, Into her grave; and thenâwhy, then the world Will roar and scramble o'er her resting-place, And play the same stale antics which she saw, And dash its brimming tides of ruddy life Across her tomb, without a care for her.â O, should we laugh or weep at human fate? There goes to shame the only mortal thing I ever loved, with all a poet's love, And I ask that, in mockery of myself! [Weeps.] [Scene closes.] SCENE VI. Before the Gate of the Tower. Enter Queen Anne, in custody of Sir William Kingston and Guard, Duke of Norfolk, Duke of Suffolk, and Lords of the Council. Queen Anne. Pause here a moment. Norfolk. Tut, tut! move along! Queen A. Did you not, sir, insult your queen enough, Before the Council, with unmanly taunts And slanders, rivalled in their gross excess But by the words in which you uttered them, Without disgracing thus your victory? Nor. It ill beseems my noted chastity To hold discourse with ladies of your stamp Stop, if you list; I 'd rather grant your wish Than parley with you. Queen A. Aid me, gracious Lord, To bear unmurmuring! (Aside.) Listen, gentlemen. 'T is the last time, perchance, that I may stand Beneath the open blessings of the sky; And here, before the majesty of heaven, Gazing unshaken in the face of God, I solemnly avow these horrid crimes, With which my enemies have vested me, To be most foul and baseless calumnies;â Or God forsake me in my strictest need! Nor. What monstrous perjury! I dare not hear This woman's self-damnation. [Going.] Suffolk. Come, my lords; Our part is done. [Exit with Norfolk and the Lords.] Queen A. Their scorn foreshows my doom: I am convicted ere the court be met. Think you I shall have justice? Kingston. Without doubt: The poorest subject of the king has that. Queen A. Ha! ha! poor man! (Laughing.) Loyal credulity! O, yes, at lastâin heaven. Where go I, sir?â Into a dungeon? Kings. No, your majesty; You lie in the state chambers. Queen A. In which rooms? Kings. Where you were lodged on Coronation-Day. Queen A. This is too cruel! Kings. Is splendor cruelty? Queen A. O, you are gracious! They are far too good For such a wretchâso abject, so forlorn, A prisoned felon;âwere it not that they Will taunt my memory with a pleasant dream, That there once practised on my facile hopes, While reason slept. Alas, alas, for me! Time, like a mocking showman, turns the picture, To teach on what coarse stuff my fancy wrought. Kings. Time may relent, and make all well ere long. Your slight constraint shall not seem bondage to you. Queen A. It matters not, if we are prisoners, Whether our walls be marked by feet or miles: I may be cramped and tethered in my will, While my clay roams the starry universe;â What but free will is freedom? Kings. Shall we enter? Queen A. Your pardon, sir, if I have wearied you With my complaints. But you have heard to-day Things that might break a prouder heart than mine. I do confess, my slanderers have wrought More on my spirits than I once believed Mere malice could.âWas it not vile? Kings. Poor queen, poor queen! (Aside.) I cannot judge, your highness. Queen A. I should not ask you to o'erstep discretion. Where is the king? Kings. At Whitehall, I believe. Queen A. Will you convey his majesty a note? Kings. I cannot. Queen A. Cannot! but a message, then? Tell himâ Kings. Indeed, I dare not. Queen A. Then, good sir, Pray bear a letter to the Chancellor. Kings. I am prohibited. Queen A. Are you a tool? Kings. Ay, but a feeling one. Queen A. Forgive me, pray! Sir, you are kind, most kind! My hasty spleen Must be abated to my present state. Come, let us in. I may be dull, perchance; But, as I live, I cannot realize That he, the father of my little child, Could so far banish all regard for me As to afflict me with deliberate wrong. No, no; I have been schooled to fearful thoughts, But this, this cannot enter Come, set on! [Exeunt into the Tower.] ACT V. SCENE I. A Room in Whitehall Palace. King Henry and Jane Seymour. Jane Seymour. Nay, my sweet Henry, shrink not for a thought. Wisdom is Janus-faced, and boldly looks Not only at dead acts of bygone times, But, in the very front of coming years, Stands forth, a prophet, to foretell events. Why should we dream upon the harmless past, If not to shape the future of our lives By its dear-purchased knowledge? King Henry. True enough. Jane S. See then what follows. Should Queen Anne die, And no male issue bless your majesty, Elizabeth, your so-called daughter, reigns.â So-called, I say; for where is your warranty To deem her truer than her faithless dam? King H. Right, by my soul! I'll disinherit her; My Parliament shall set her claim aside: We'll have no bastards on our English throne, To mock our justice. Jane S. Ah! the Parliament! But what it does, it can undo again. King H. Ay, ay; 't were safer to divorce the queen, And so, as in our daughter Mary's case, Cut off Elizabeth. Jane S. 'T will trouble you, For many a weary day, if the bold queen Should stand up stiffly for her royal rights, Nor yield to you. King H. Nor yield?â'ods wounds! she shall! I'll have each tittle of my liberty, Ere we break quits. Why, it were monstrous, base, To offer our good subjects her vile sprout By way of queen! 'T was rumored, at her birth, That Bess was not my own. (Enter Duke of Norfolk.) In good time, Norfolkâ How proceeds our cause? Norfolk. Slowly, my liege. King H. Push on, push on! Nor. Ha, ha! my royal hound, Do you scent blood at last? (Aside.) Mark Smeaton now Will swear to anything beneath the moon; But all the others are intractable. When of their common guilt we question them, Rochford but gives a melancholy smile; Weston stares at us with his great bright eyes, As if he doubted of our sanity; Brereton, scowling, fumbles for his sword; And Henry Norris has gone virtue-mad: He raves and swears about his innocence, And vows he never will accuse the queen, Whom in his conscience he believes most pure. King H. Hang him up, hang him up, then! Nor. Wonderful! He grows blood-thirsty. 'T was but yesterday He saved a fly from drowning, and so talked, And moralized so sweetly on this theme, As nigh re-drowned the insect in his tears. [Aside.] Yes; but before he hangs, could we succeed In throwing him, or one of gentle blood, Into the balance 'gainst her majesty, 'T would show her light as air. Jane S. You doubt her guilt? Nor. Not I, my lady; but opinion weighs No atom in the jealous scales of law. King H. We'll suit the triers to the evidence. She is false, without debate; then wherefore, sir, Should we be nice about the means we use? A band of angels, sworn upon our side, Could not increase her guilt. Nor. Doubtless, my liege; But 't would convict her to the common mind: For, as we stand, this base-born, wavering groom Is our sole witness; and we lose respect By such a tottering basis to our cause. The peopleâ King H. Furies seize them, root and branch Here comes that bugbear of a timid court, That noisy nothing, to assail our ears! Sir, I more reverence a flock of geeseâ Being a Roman in that one ideaâ Than all the banded folly of the earth. Is there more wisdom in a million fools Than one alone? Shall folly gain respect By bare addition? Jane S. Please your majesty, His grace but cares for your committed honor In this regard. King H. I know his loyalty: But shall a monarch answer to a mob For private deeds? Lord, save their silliness! 'T is scarce a twelvemonth since they howled at us, âWe'll have no Nanny Boleyn for our queen!â And now they saint her! Norfolk, look at them As on a crowd of human weathercocks, That ever point right in the teeth of power, Howe'er it veer. Join me anon, your grace; I fain would hit upon some speedy scheme That may annul my marriage with the queen. Sweetheart, come walk. Nor. I will attend your highness. [Exeunt King Henry and Jane Seymour.] So all this pother, all this hanging men, Divorcing wives, and chopping off of heads, Is for mere happinessâan endless chase! As if a man, so stuffed with memories Of the dark path that led him to his hopes, Could taste enjoyment if he reached his wish! Good Lord, a king may be a royal fool! This outdoes alchemy.âI 'd rather fight 'Gainst nature for the boon of endless life, And hope to turn God's purpose upside downâ Chase the horizon till I found the spot Where heaven meets earth, and, with that blissful kiss, Rains joy celestial on the duller landâ Run down the rainbow to the golden spring Of its bright archâbelieve a poet's dreamâ Do any shallow thing, but set sound wits Upon a chase for phantom happiness. Ha, ha! king motley! Give me power, power, power! [Exit.] SCENE II. The State Apartments in the Tower. Queen Anne alone. Queen Anne. Ye rugged walls, how often have ye heard The weary moans of prisoned innocence, By bondage plundered of its cheerful spirit, Broken in will, bankrupt in energy; And when at last thought has so preyed on thought As to debase the judgment's faculty, Robbed of that God-sustaining power of right Which lifts the soul above calamity! O woe! O woe! shall I become at length A mental wreck, a chaos of despair, With scarcely strength in my enervate mind To see the conscience-drawn dividing line That marks the boundary between right and wrong? Alas! I fear it; for I cannot tell What high prerogative, that once was mine, I would not barter for mere liberty. (Enter, behind, Lady Boleyn and Mrs. Cosyns.) Lady Boleyn. Still lost in thoughts. Mrs. Cosyns. I'll warrant them not good. Lady B. Then stand aside. If she should utter aught, Above a whisper, we can catch its sense. Mrs. C. Then to his grace, and so unto the king. Good luck! my lady, it is merry, this, To be familiar with their majestiesâ To be the very spirit of the words That go between them. Lady B. Hush! the queen begins. Queen A. This awful pauseâthis quivering of the beam That balances my hesitating fateâ This watchful agony of rigid sense, Bending all faculties in one fixed stare, That hangs upon the dial of events, And counts the passing moments, without power To urge or slacken their relentless courseâ Would make a faith in settled destiny Far preferable to chance. Then stolid force Might brazen out the frowns of hopeless fate, And learn to suffer what it could not change. But, O, the thought that we, the rulers born Of time and fortune and opposed events, Can be so meshed in outward circumstance As to lose influence o'er our very lives, Gives to adversity its bitterest pangs, And takes from will its living soul of hope! Lady B. That 's rare philosophy, I question not, But it is bad religion. Mrs. C. Terrible! Queen A. Avenging Heaven, and I deserve it all! Lady B. That 's broad confession. Mrs. C. Shameless! How she dared The wrath of Heaven, in her stout impudence! Queen A. Yes, I deserve it; but 't is double pain, To feel the chastisements of angry Heaven Meted to me in seeming punishment For that whereof I am guiltless. Lady B. Heard you that? Mrs. C. Nay, I'm a little deaf. Queen A. O Wolsey, Wolsey! I, whose ambitious footstep thrust aside Your tottering ageâI, who with crafty toil Climbed to the seat of patient Katharineâ Feel every pang with which I tortured you! My power is gone; another cunning maid Plays o'er my part of heartless treachery. O More and Fisherâblood, blood!âsave my wits!â If fate like theirs should close my history, To make Heaven's doom complete! Why shrink at that? For 't is but one, among a thousand ways, Of stepping from the world. And what were life, Declining by degrees of misery To chill oblivion?âQueen of yesterdayâ The rabble's pityâan old doting crone, That some fool's grandsire, âMarry, knew as queen!â Rattling her toothless jaws in silly prate About herselfââAnd how they crowned her once, With a great crown all full of shining stones; And what brave velvet farthingales she wore; And how she reigned; and, well-a-day, how fell!â Pah! it sets death a-laughing. Gracious Heaven, But grant my sinfulness one little prayerâ 'T is all I askâdrive on the lagging days, And bring this matter to its fated end; For there are seeds of madness in my grief That must o'ertop my reason! (Lady Boleyn and Mrs. Cosyns advance.) Mrs. C. Please you, lady. [To Queen Anne.] Lady B. Your majesty. Mrs. C. She hears us not. Queen A. Well, well! But Rochford, ay, and all my noble friends, Crowded together in a general doom; As if my enemies had sworn to leave No vestige of me. Bitter, bitter hate! My father nextâ Mrs. C. Yes, please you, he is well. Queen A. Who spoke? Mrs. C. Your servant. Queen A. Service without love. Lady B. You wrong her much. Queen A. You too, false kinswoman? Lady B. Marry, and if your highness had not held Such high opinion of familiar friends, You 'd ne'er been here. 'T is a good worldly rule, As treachery harms more than enmity, To tell no tales but what we tell our foes. Queen A. Deep in the world, but shallow in the heart. What brings you here? Lady B. The welfare of yourself, And the deliverance of your noble brother, With all his prisoned friends. Queen A. When owls can sing, I'll listen, cousin. Lady B. Scold, but credit me. Queen A. What is the price? If it involve my life, I'll coin my heart's blood, to the utmost drop, But I will pay it. Lady B. 'T is that you agree To offer no obstruction to the king In his proposed divorce. Queen A. Dare you insultâ Nay, nay, forgive my haste. Is it the king Who wills his daughter's shame? who barters life On terms that blacken mercy's reverend hand, And sink her calling to mere brokery? Is this divorce his wish? Mrs. C. It is, your highness; I had it from his lips. Lady B. 'T will but oppose, And not defeat his plan, if you refuse. Denial carries death to all; when you, By bare concession, gain a pregnant hope. Queen A. Hope, hope for me! O God, what mockery!â I wish for nothing. Show me, beyond doubt, That 't is the king's command, and I will yield. Mrs. C. A wise conclusion. Queen A. Spare your comments, madam; My duty tutors better than your tongue. The very vileness of this proffered trade Gives it the lie. O, 't is far past belief, To deem a father so unnatural: Sure 't is but trial of my patient love The king intends.âWhy, glimmering hopes seem born From the sheer blackness of surrounding things, Like little stars at midnight. [Aside.] Mrs. C. Bless my soul, Her highness smiles! Queen A. Why not? Lady B. Be still, you fool! Her subtle mind is twisting in a net Of its own flimsy thoughts. [Apart to Mrs. Cosyns.] Mrs. C. I am not your wench! What the king orders me, I will perform, Though all the Lady Boleyns in the land Cry âFool, and fool!â [Apart to Lady Boleyn.] If it would please your highness, Now, while this candid mood possesses you, To make confession to us of the crimes For which you suffer; and so spare the kingâ Lady B. The loose-tongued idiot! [Aside.] Queen A. Out! you heartless wretch! Are you a woman? Have you borne a child? And would you snatch it from your wolfish breast, To stamp the bastard on its baby brow? Mrs. C. I have no child. Queen A. Heaven keep you barren, then, You shameless slanderer of your mother's sex! Dare you to traffic for my chastityâ The natural patent of all womanhoodâ That more becomes my naked innocence Than the great ring of jewelled royalty? O! had I lost it, I would barter crown, And queenly dignityâyea, life itselfâ To wear it but one hour of agony, Then hand it spotless to posterity. Fie! you are rank, if you have never felt Your sex's instinct! Mrs. C. Lady, let us go: Her majesty so stormsâ Lady B. Yes, slink away, You wretched marplot! [Apart to Mrs. Cosyns.] Queen A. Get to your prayersâgo! Send to your heart each drop of modest blood, That ever mustered in your virgin cheeks, At wanton thoughts, to wash away this shame! Mrs. C. Come, come; she'll rail again. [Exit with Lady Boleyn.] Queen A. This killing doubt! What can it mean?âwhere am I?âis it real? For I have read how some have seemingly Passed ages in a dream; have died and risen; Have wandered on through shadows limitless, And passed the radiant gates of Paradise, To dwell for days unnumbered with the Saints; Have woke at last, and found the blazing sun, That shaped the fancies of their lengthened vision, Just peeping from the east. Is life a dream? Is time a mere illusion of the mind? And shall we waken from our restless sleep, To see the glory-beaming face of God Smile in our eyes a summons to that life Where all is real? What to my endless soul Is this flat pageantry of days and years? Events, not hours, are measurers of our lives, And I in deeds have far outlived my term; While sorrows, heavier than three-score and ten May often totter under, bow my head, That only needs the hoary badge of time To make old age complete. Why should I stand And dally thus with my kind landlord, Death, Upon the threshold of his narrow house, While all without is dark and shelterless, And all so bright within? Why fear to leave The fickle favors that mankind bestow, For the sure bounties of Omnipotence? O God, I know not! but my startled heart Rises in loud rebellion at the hint Of that chill power whose torpid tyranny Shall still its play forever. Love, fame, powerâ Ay, all, all, everything, the uttermost!â Have vanished in the shadow of my wrongs; And yet I gripe life's load of misery, As if there were a hope beyond my loss! [Exit.] SCENE III. The Gate of the Tower, surrounded by a crowd of Citizens, endeavoring to enter, who are kept back by a guard of men-at-arms. Enter, from the Tower, First Citizen. Citizens. What news, what news? First Citizen. What news can you expect? Second Citizen. The queen's deliverance. First C. Nonsense! where the king Is chief accuser? Third Citizen. Ay; but justice, sir. First C. Speak not so loud ere the lords might overhear, And lose their loyalty. Third C. What mean you, friend? First C. Her highness is prejudged, and, save in form, Doomed ere her cause be heard. Second C. Made she defence? First C. O yes, most eloquent and strongly knit: Beauty and truth came hand in hand together, To breathe their essence in each modest word.â But what avails an angel's purity Where devils judge? 'T is a bare legal form, This solemn meeting of her enemies, Disguising hate in ermined justice' gown. Second C. This is blunt talk. First C. But true. Third C. But dangerous, To speak and hear. First C. What are state trials now, More than the whetting of the headsman's axe? We English people have forgot the rights Which God and nature give to every man: Our common justice is a common drabâ A pliant doxy, openly deboshedâ That winks beneath her twisted blind at lords, Doffs it for kingsâ Citizens. Forbear, forbear! First C. Pshaw, sirs! I am a careless, melancholy man, Who would not change a notion for my life. I sought this trial of her majesty To escape myself for a brief interval; But, as I live, it crowded in such thoughts Upon my proper griefs, that I would rather Be damned to wear the memory of a fiend, Than witness such another. Third C. Friends, away! This man is vile, upon his own confession. Lord, sirs, what words were these! First C. Slink, cowards, slink! Get to your slavish homes! Brush up your caps! Practise your loyal lungs! Make ready all To startle Heaven, when good Queen Anne dies, With âGod preserve Queen Jane!â Third C. This man is mad. Second C. Nay, sirs, but simple. First C. O! that all of you, Two-legged crawlers to ignoble graves, Were half so mad as I! [Exit.] Third C. Poor soul, poor soul! Where is his keeper? He may come to harm. Second C. Let us take the fool's advice, and hurry home; For there 's no chance of entrance to the Tower. [Exeunt.] SCENE IV. The Great Hall of the Tower, arranged for the Queen's trial. On one side are seated Dukes of Norfolk, Suffolk, and Richmond, Marquis of Exeter, Earl of Arundel, and other Peers, as Lords Triers, with Officers, &amp;c.; on the other, Queen Anne, in the custody of Sir William Kingston, Ladies, Attendants, Guards, &amp;c. Norfolk. Are we agreed? [To the Lords.] Suffolk. Here is our verdict, sir. [Hands a paper.] (Richmond and Suffolk talk apart.) Richmond. I hope, your grace, I have damned my soul enough To please the most fastidious father. Suf. Stuff! Rich. Yes, âstuff!â substantial, downright villany, That I shall bear upon my aching heart Till death unload it. Suf. Come, be cheerful, sir. It ill becomes heroic minds to shrink From the first blood of triumph. You are young And dainty-minded; time will strengthen you. Rich. Courage but adds deformity to crime. A wicked heart, though placid as a lake, Girt and controlled by rigid barriers, Can but reflect each blessing of sweet heaven, And every bordering virtue of our earth, All topsy-turvy. I am hardened, sir; If not by years, at least by sinfulness, That wrinkled register of ill-spent days, Who scars his moments on the erring heart, While yet the brow is smooth! Suf. The saints look down! This pretty sermon must have washed you clean. Hist! hear the sentence. Nor. Lady Anne Boleyn, Marchioness of Pembroke, sometime England's queenâ Though most unworthily, as the strict course Of equal justice has so clearly provedâ Arise. (The Queen rises.) Lay off your crown and vestured marks Of royal dignity, to hear from me The solemn finding of this high tribunal. (Queen Anne puts off her crown and robe of state.) Queen Anne. Your grace's first commands, though harshly meant, Are merciful indeed. Nor. Be silent, madam! Upon each several charge, whereon you stand Indicted by the law, we do pronounce Your guilt most clear; and therefore do condemn you, At such time as his majesty may name, To suffer death by burning at the stake, Or by beheading, as may please the king.â God give you patience to endure your doom! Queen A. I doubt it not. O Father, O Creator, Who art the way, the life, the truth, Thou know'st If I deserve this death! Rich. O! base, base, base! This pardons Herod in the eye of Heaven. [Aside.] Nor. Marchioness of Pembroke, have you aught to say Touching the judgment of this court? Queen A. My lords, I will not say your sentence is unjustâ Presuming that my reasons can prevail Against your firm convictions;âI would rather Believe that you have reasons for your acts, Of ample power to vindicate your fames; But, then, they must be other than the court Has heard produced: for by the evidence I have been cleared, to all unbiassed minds, Of each offence 'gainst which that proof was brought. I have been ever to his majesty A faithful wife: O! could I say as truly That I have shown him the humility His goodness, and the honor he conferred, Deserved from me! I have, I do confess, Had jealous fancies and suspicious thoughtsâ In which, perchance, I wronged himâthat had I Been more discreet and anxious to conceal, I had been more the queen, but less the wife. God is my witness, that in no way else Have I e'er sinned against him. Think not, my lords, I say this to prolong My heavy life; for God has fortified My trust in Him, and taught me how to die. Think me not so bewildered in my mind, As not to lay my chastity to heart, Now in my last extremity; for I Have held its honor far above my crown, And have maintained no queenly dignity More pure from vulgar stain. I know my words Can naught avail me, save to justify My chastity, so perilled by your doom. As for my brother, and those constant friends With me unjustly sentenced, I would die A thousand deaths to save their guiltless lives: But since it has so pleased his majesty, I will accompany them, most willingly, Through death to heaven, through pain to endless peace. I have said all. Nor. Remove the prisoner. (Queen Anne bows to the Court, and is led off by Sir William Kingston. Then exeunt all but the Lords Triers.) Rich. We are damned forever! Nor. Poh, poh! saved, I think. While she held power heads flew like tennis-balls. Arundel. Why did she touch so lightly on the king? Exeter. 'T was for a cause no deeper than the heart,â She loves him yet. Arun. The sentimental fool! Rich. Have you no grosser phrases? âFool,â forsooth! There 's the last blow to greatness!âArundel Claims her as kindred! Nor. Gentlemen, away! Our sun of power is burning in mid air; We waste the daylight. Come, let us seek the king. Hug every Seymour that you chance to meet! [Exeunt.] SCENE V. The State Apartments in the Tower. Queen Anne alone. Queen Anne There 's not a pang remains; there 's not a wound, That hate can give, at which my nerveless heart Would shrink appalled The storm of life has blown, And rent my prospect into countless shreds, Chaotic, undistinguished, featurelessâ Without a point, before me or behind, On which a once familiar eye may restâ And all is calm again. Calm, very calm,â An utter desolation fixed and grim, And barren as the sand. No queen, no wifeâ Ebbed to the lowest. O Elizabeth, My helpless child, whose rights were all in me, How could a mother blast her memory, Even in thy eyes, by yielding to her foes Thy royal heritage? Thou 'lt hate me, love; Thou 'lt say thy mother wronged thee, eking out Her worthless days with treasures stolen from thee; Unweeting how thy uncle and my friends Owed life to thee. Why must I wander down All coming time to pick new sorrows out?â (A bell tolls. Queen Anne rushes to the door.) Whose knell is that? Sentinel. (Without.) Lord Rochford's. Queen A. Duped, duped, duped! O God! my brother!âIs there such a one As an avenging God to look on this, And not launch fire like rain? O! shameless men!â Men with God's raiment on their placid limbsâ Who almost swore his life should be preserved, If I opposed not this divorce. O nature!â Thou who dost send the harmless race of flowers, And dews, and sunshine, and all gracious thingsâ What creatures hast thou sent to people earth, And blot thy fair creation? Cut them down! Or make this globe a dusty wilderness, Fit for their habitation! Man, O man! Thou art the only thing in nature's scheme That seems disjointed from the harmony,â The latest thought and worst! (Enter Mary Wyatt.) Mary Wyatt Your majestyâ Queen A. I prithee mock me not. I am no queen, Nor wife, nor maidâI know not what I am! Mary W. What has disturbed you? Queen A. Did you hear that bell? Mary W. Pray, pray forgive me! [Kneels, weeping.] Queen A. Nay, I'll kneel to you, If I have vexed you. [A distant shot is heard.] Rochford! [Another shot.] Norris! [Another shot.] Weston! [Another shot.] And Brereton! Why stop your cannon? Shoot!â Shoot on, till half the world shall suffer death; For you have slain the noblest part! No, no; The next shall be my own! Mary W. Alas! alas! [Weeping.] Queen A. Why weep you, girl? My brother was in heaven, Ere you could hear the noisy cannon-shot Tell his departure. Mary W. Would your highness fly, If I could ope these hideous prison-doors? Queen A. Not for the world. Mary W. My brother has a plan To raise the common people in revoltâ Queen A. Hold, if you 'd live! I yet am so much queen As to protect my realm from traitor's arts. How dare you plot these treasonable designs Against the safety of his majesty? Name it again, and, as I live, the king Shall know your thoughts! Mary W. 'T was but our love for youâ Queen A. How! love for me, and plotting 'gainst the king! Mary W. Strange, very strange! [Aside.] (Enter Sir William Kingston and Guard.) Queen A. My time has come, Sir William? Kingston. It has, my lady. Queen A. You delayed my death: I should have died some hours ago. 'T is cruel To dally with my life. Kings. 'T was not my fault. The Council feared a rising of the commons, And therefore changed the hour. Queen A. Ha! ha! how weak! [Laughing.] Who cares about my death? Is Smeaton dead? Kings. He is. Queen A. And made he no amends to me? Did he not own his monstrous perjuries? Kings. Not that I heard. Queen A. The impious, heartless wretch! To dare o'erleap the doubtful gulf of death, With such a fearful load! Mary W. His death was just, Even had he done no wrong,âthe inborn felon! Queen A. Nay, Mary, chide no more. Alas! poor Mark, I fear thy soul is suffering for thy tongue. Can I not see my daughter? Kings. 'Tis forbidden. Queen A. Well, I suppose the human frame can bear More than I sufferâvery little more! Kings. My lady. [Bell tolls.] Queen A. That speaks plainer, sir. I am ready I hope 't will be but death, not butchery. Kings. The pain is short. Queen A. They call the headsman skilled; And Iâha! ha!âsee, good Sir William, seeâ [Laughing.] I have a little neck! [Clasps her neck.] Kings. Why, is she mad? I in my time I have seen full many die, But ne'er before saw one who laughed outright At the mere thought of death. [Aside.] (Bell tolls.) Queen A. Come, Mary, come: We keep death waiting. Mary W. Heaven preserve her mind! [Aside.] Queen A. Set on, Sir William! You shall see, ere long, How, like a bride, I'll meet this ugly death, And make a triumph of my funeral! Pray tell his majesty, in my behalf, How much I thank him for his many favors. He from a lady made me marchioness; And from a marchioness he raised me up To the full top of earthly power, a queen: And last, his graces overrunning life, He crowns my innocence with martyrdom. My name is set above the reach of time, A mark for men to carp and wonder at; And some hereafter will believe me false, Some think me true; bear witness, sir, That with my latest breath I still declare My perfect purity. (Bell tolls.) Set on, set on! [Exeunt.] SCENE VI. The Tower Green At the back of the stage is a scaffold, hung with black, on which are the block, Headsman, Attendants, Guard, etc. The citizens gradually assemble in front of the scaffold. A bell tolls at long intervals. First Citizen. I'll watch all day, but what I'll see her die.â Let them change hours, I care not. Come along. Second Citizen. Here's a good stand. Third Citizen. Yes; if 't is good to stand, And see our poor queen mangled. First C. âPoor queen,â sooth! Second C. You are a scholar, neighbor Marmaduke; I pray you, was there e'er a queen before Who graced a scaffold? Third C. Ne'er before in England Did monarch dare so try his people's patience. First C. We are in luck. Third C. Fie! fie! you bloody knave! First C. Marry, and if a king cannot behead His own liege wife, whom can he? Third C. Monstrous dolt! First C. What were the good of treason, then, if we Could have no executions?âMistress Maud,â Hey, hey! you brought the children? [To a woman.] Woman. Yes, indeed; They cannot see a queen die every day. Third C. You tiger-hearted woman, do you love The sight of blood? Woman. Nay; the example, sir. Third C. Lord, Lord! who ever caught a woman yet Without pretexts in thousands! First C. 'T is a shame To keep us honest people waiting so. Citizens. (Without.) The queen! the queen! First C. Move nearer. Citizens. Make way there! Solemn music. Enter Duke of Norfolk, Duke of Suffolk, and other Noblemen; Queen Anne in custody of Sir William Kingston; Mary Wyatt, and other Maids of Honor; Guards, Attendants, etc. They mount the scaffold. Then enter, below Thomas Wyatt. Wyatt. One look, no more. O! wondrous, wondrous fair! Death has made treaty with thy loveliness, To hide the horrors that invest his state. These spiteful clouds of earth-born misery But add a glory to thy going down. Slander, disgrace, fraud, legal infamy, Imprisonment, this hideous form of death, Each gains a splendor from its touch of thee That robs regret of tears. How bright, how calm! There is a voiceless sermon in that face, To cheer the lonely heart of martyrdom, And make it court its fate. O, Anne, Anne! The world may banish all regard for thee, Mewing thy fame in frigid chronicles, But every memory that haunts my mind Shall cluster round thee still. I'll hide thy name Under the coverture of even lines, I'll hint it darkly in familiar songs, I'll mix each melancholy thought of thee Through all my numbers: so that heedless men Shall hold my love for thee within their hearts, Not knowing of the treasure. 'T would be sin To keep so fair a flower from paradise,â That, in the very flush of earthly bloom, Felt mildew blown on every ruffian wind, And canker at the heart. Go, go,âfarewell! The sun that seems departing, to our eyes, Is but arising on another land; Thy death to us is the short, painful birth That ushers in thy taintless soul to heaven.â Go, go! I would not raise a hand to keep thee here. [Exit.] Third C. Be silent! Hear her majesty. Citizens. Hush, hush! Queen Anne. Good Christian people, I am come to die, According to the judgment of the law; And therefore it would ill become me now, After my doom is past, to censure it. I am come hither to accuse no man, Nor to say aught upon the many things Whereof I am accused: for well I know That my defence doth not pertain to you, Nor from your favor could I hope for grace. I am come here to die, to yield myself To the king's will, with all humility. I pray God save him, and extend his reign; For he has been a gracious prince to you: To meâI doubt not but his goodness went Beyond my slender merit. I but ask, Should you hereafter judge my luckless cause, The best of each man's judgment. Now, farewell, To you and to the world! Forget me not, In the still places of your earnest prayers Attend me, maidens. Mary Wyatt. O! not yet, not yet! [Weeping.] Queen A. Well, I have played the waiting-maid before, In happier hours. Alas! poor head, thou 'lt roll In a brief time amid this scaffold's dust; As thou in life didst not deserve a crown, So by thy doom is justice satisfied, And her great beam repoised. [Removing her collar and coifs.] And ye, my damsels, Who whilst I lived did ever show yourselves So diligent in service, and are now To be here present in my latest hour Of mortal agony,âas in good times Ye were most trustworthy, even so in this, My miserable death, ye leave me not. As a poor recompense for your rich love, I pray you to take comfort for my lossâ And yet forget me not. To the king's grace, And to the happier one whom you may serve In place of me, be faithful as to me. Learn from this scene, the triumph of my fate, To hold your honors far above your lives. When you are praying to the martyred Christ, Remember me, who, as my weakness could, Faltered afar behind His shining steps, And died for truth, forgiving all mankind. The Lord have pity on my helpless soul! [Kneels at the block.] (As the curtain falls, a peal of ordnance announces the death of Queen Anne.) LEONOR DE GUZMAN: A TRAGEDY. DRAMATIS PERSONÃ.

Medina Sidonia. Before the Gates of the Castle. Sentinels on duty. The morning drum is heard, and the ceremony of relieving guard passes; then enter, from the Castle, Coronel and CaÃ±edo. The Sentinels salute them. Coronel. The saints relieve me from my governorship! My honors hang about me like wide clothes Upon a shrunken body; I scarce move Without some awkward stumble, plainly showing My great unfitness for my great command. I'll never make a courtier. Look, CaÃ±edo, How do these silken slops become a frame Worn gaunt in armor? Does this feathered cap Droop o'er the ugly line my helmet fretted Round my bald forehead? Can this chain and key Cover my gashes? Or this slender staff Bear the huge weight of my uncourtly limp Through bows and cringes? Bah! I spat at fortune When I forsook the wars. CaÃ±edo. Despite thy âbah,â One sees the wolf's teeth grinning plain enough Through the sheep's fleece. Cor. Ay, there 's the curse of it! But yesterday I had a boon to ask,â I vow I asked it in my smoothest phrase,â When, to my horror, DoÃ±a Leonor Laughed in my face, and said, in her mild way, âOut with your dagger, Coronel! The act Would fit the voice.â CaÃ±. And thou? Cor. And I! I ranâ Broke through her maidens, like a hurricane Through the rose-gardens of Granadaâran To find a mandolin, and pitch my voice Down to its finest note. Pray, hear me now, In the sharp treble of my lady's page: âPar Dieu,ââthey say that 's French,ââI've found a band, A pretty band of silkâpar Dieu! I have; And I have vowed to Mary and Saint James To bind it on its ravishing abode, Or die in treasuring itâpar Dieu! I have!â Which means, in simple speaking, I have found A wench's garter, and would tie it on. Fie! fie! it turns my stomach inside out, To hear their lady-talk. CaÃ±. Such blows on hand, While we are rusting here without a rub! Moors flying pell-mellâDon Alfonso's spears Combing their horse-tails out upon the windâ Gibraltar's garrison with all its eyes Fixed upon Africa, as on a goalâ The plague afoot tooâHeaven at work with manâ Why death must caper like a harlequin! Cor. Ay, how I long to have my iron out! CaÃ±edo, just hold still, and be my Moor, Until I break this stick across thy sconce. [Breaks his wand over CaÃ±edo's head.] CaÃ±. Thou dost not strike with the old force. Cor. I fear it. Did I not hurt thee? CaÃ±. Not a whit. Cor. That's sad! Had I my great Toledo, thou shouldst dance. CaÃ±. But had I mine?â Cor. What then? CaÃ±. I'd dance thee to Much the same music. Cor. If thy sword agreed, In length or temper, with that tongue of thine, The Cid would shoulder over in his tomb, To give thee room beside him. CaÃ±. Hold thy prate, Or I may choke thee with thy governor's chain! Cor. Not till I 'd thumped thy mazzard with its key. CaÃ±. Saint Jago! but I'll teach theeâ Cor. All thou know'st, And after dub me fool. CaÃ±. Here 's sharper wit. [Drawing.] Cor. It draws as sharp reply. [Drawing.] CaÃ±. Now keep thy ward. First Sentinel. Good gentlemen! [Advancing.] Second Sentinel. Keep back! the blood they shed I'll catch in a tailor's thimble. CaÃ±. Art thou ready? Cor. For what? CaÃ±. To have thy throat cut. Cor. As thou art. First S. Are they not brave? Second S. Ay, as twin lions, boy: They live to wrangle; they'll ne'er die for it. (Coronel and CaÃ±edo fight.) Cor. CaÃ±edo, hist! look there. [Drops his sword.] CaÃ±. Where? Cor. O'er the hill. CaÃ±. I am no hawk. What seest thou? Cor. An armed band Topping the hillâa mass of moving steelâ The fore-guard of an army, if I know A bodkin from a sword. Ho! ho! CaÃ±edo, Throw up thy cap! Gibraltar has been won, And here comes King Alfonso with the spoils! Turn out the guard, and saddle my dun horse; I'll meet our sovereign on the way. Ho, there! Shake out the yellow silk of old Castile! Run to the outer wall, and make it blaze With our bright hauberks and our lifted spears, Until the very stones appear on fire, While our bold trumpets ring in heaven's glad ear, Its soldier has returned with victory! [Drums. Exit Guard.] CaÃ±. Hast thou the plague? Cor. Ever, when thou art near. Thou ugly budget of mortality, Throw up thy cap! or, by the saints, I'll make Thy cap and thee a fixture in the air, By hanging thee for treason! CaÃ±. Well, hurra! [Throwing up his cap.] Behold thy sign in heaven,âan empty cap, As thine is always. Cor. Hum! thy hair-patch fills it With anything but wit. Go take the news Of yonder marchâfor I'm in desperate hasteâ To DoÃ±a Leonor. CaÃ±. I see thy drift: Thou wouldst evade thy duties, governor. O, fie! do courtesy by deputy? Cor. Now, my dear friendâ CaÃ±. I'll face the devil first! I hate a woman. Cor. They are quits with thee. She may discover it as best she can. I'll not be jeered at. There shall be no more âOut with your dagger, Coronel,â to please All the best dames of love within the land. And yet I fearâ CaÃ±. By Jupiter, thou 'rt right! A peasant's honest drudge takes rank with me Before the wanton of an emperor. Cor. Go in to thy command, and man the walls: I'll mount, and gallop forth to meet the king. [Exeunt severally.] SCENE II. The Same. The Great Hall of the Castle. Leonor de Guzman discovered seated in state, surrounded by Don Juan De Lara, Don Fernando de Villena, Don Tello, Courtiers, Knights, Ladies, Men-at-Arms, &amp;c. Don Juan de Lara is in the act of investing Don Tello with a crimson Scarf, the order of âLa Banda.â Lara. Arise, Don Tello, of the crimson band, A noble knight, and brother in our arms! I thus salute thee. [Embraces him.] Leonor. And, I pledge my faith, He shall prove worthy of the dignity. I pray you, gentlemen, make way for me: [Advancing.] A mother's kiss should not be last to greet The honors of a son. (Kisses Don Tello.) Don Tello, know This order was bestowed to spur thee on To actions that may make thy worth appear Equal with our bestowing. This fair badge Is not an ornament for festal days, A ribbon to enrich thy vanity, But the illustrious mark by which Castile Knows her great children, and can turn to them With confident assurance of such deeds As raised her glory to its present height. Thy breast is girt as with a ring of fire: An evil act within its circle looks Prodigious to beholders, and draws all To fix their concentrated eyes upon The splendid criminal. Small flames on heights Show further than great fires in humbler spots; And they who see them from the vale below Oft take a candle for a meteor. Remember this; and fear thy slightest fault May spread corruption through an empery. Lara. (Apart to Villena.) Right royal that, and to the purpose, too: Some one has told her of Don Tello's slips. Villena. (Apart to Lara.) Ay, if a lance-head ever fray that band, Charge me with scandal. Lara. Hark! there 's more to come. Leo. Don Tello, thy renown lies next my heart, Close to thy father's. I have much to say;â But no,ânot here. A mother's privilege Borders too near the sanctity of prayer For public ears. Call the ambassador. [Resumes her state.] Flourish. Enter the Ambassador from the Rebel, Don Juan Manuel, with Gentlemen, Soldiers, Attendants, &amp;c., bearing sumptuous presents. Ambassador. (Kissing DoÃ±a Leonor's hand.) Lady, my lord salutes you with these gifts, Rather as evidence of his good will, Than as fit offering to your deserts. The gods, who scorned the shepherd's sacrifice Of curds, and wine, and bleeding throats of lambs, Looked not unkindly on the worshipper, Despite the simple service of his hands.â Leo. Pray you, end there. To offer mortal ears That which becomes divinity alone, Insults its majesty and our plain sense. The power I hold is delegated trust From the true centre of all power, the king. If you have business that concerns the state, I'll hear with patience; if you 'd deal with Heaven, Carry your incense to the nearest church. Lara. (Apart to Villena.) Mark the ambassador! That lofty stride Tripped up his earthly progress. Vil. How he burns! His throat is full of thistles. Leo. Is there aught, Between Don Manuel and his majesty, That our discourse may further? Am. Much, your grace, But not intended for publicity. Leo. Speak out. The government deserves distrust That stops the people's ears while it debates. Am. Your wishes are commands. Don Manuel, Some time in arms against his sovereign, Proffers his fealty to you, and swears To be your liegeman on a single term. Leo. Name it. The king would stretch his clemency, To make a friend of his illustrious foe. Am. 'T is a condition pleasant to the kingâ Or rumor lies for once in good reportâ And honorable to her for whom 't is urged: Simply, that Don Alfonso should divorce That hag of Portugalâ Leo. Sir, let me say, That is no title in Castilian ears To know their queen by. How now, gentlemen, Is there no gauntlet down upon the word? You downcast men, do you not blush to see The spurs of chivalry upon your heels? (Lara, Villena, and other Knights, throw their gauntlets before the Ambassador.) There, on my faith, you see 't is raining steel! Thou backward, Tello! [He throws down his gauntlet.] And, to crown them all, Behold a prince's glove upon the heap! Bear our defiance to Don Manuel; And say, a word of treason is a spell, To conjure up such loyal storms as this, In our Castilian air. Your pardon, sir: We check your lord, not his ambassador. What follows this? Am. Your coronation, lady. After divorcement of the queen, my lord Would see the imperfect throne made whole by you. Leo. What say you, sirs? My lord of Lara, speak. Lara. I only may repeat the general voice, Strengthened by sanction from the king himself. Accept the offer, not as his alone, But as the constant wish of all Castile. Leo. Speak, Don Fernando. Vil. Lara's choice is mine. Leo. My son, Don Tello? Tello. If they make me royal, I'll fill my office with what grace I can. Certes, if one held out a crown to me, I should not put my hands behind my back. Leo. Thou art the frankest speaker of them all. Ah, gentlemen, it is your private hopes Of what may follow to yourselves, through me, That hurries this advancement. Lara. You mistake, At least in me, the object of our hopes. Through you Castile would flourishâ Leo. Has it not? If naught's accomplished, nothing can I do. I found this land an armÃ©d wilderness, A chain of citadels, and all between Was desolation trampled into dust By a fierce soldiery, who only brooked The fiercer orders of their savage chiefs. So, in the midst, I built a house of peace, An unwalled palace, full of open doors; And round about I spread a garden-plot, Hedged it with flowers, and from its sculptured urns I sent the streams back to their native heaven, Returned in music. No defence was mine, Save the imploring weakness of the flowers, The scented dews my fountains scattered out, And the light blushes of my garrison. Yet at my gate War laid aside his spear, And vines ran round it, from the hand-worn grasp Up to the steely point, whence blossoms hung Trembling with horror. Ay, the rugged god Doffed his grim casque, and sat beside my feet, Until I schooled him with the mandolin; Or taught his awkward limbs to move apace In other measures than the martial tread. Are these things naught? These are my conquests, sirs; And she who steps beyond her threshold's dust, To play Achilles in her woman's gear, Shall find the sword-hilt frets her dainty hand, And the great helmet makes her forehead ache. Lara. Yet there are other duties of a queen,â Calm government, the sway of useful days, Bent on a nation's welfare. Leo. Ah! the hand That takes a sceptre up, knows not how soon The royal symbol must become a sword. Am. But, ladyâ Leo. Ay, sir, so much for myself; Now for the weightier matters of the realm. What are your master's ends in this affair? Am. I am his spokesman, not his confidant. Leo. Mark, how much nearer to his heart am I Don Manuel fears Castile's advancing power May crush the Moor, and win a general peace: In which conjuncture, rebels like himself Could ill abide our undistracted arms. His safety hangs upon our foreign wars. Divorce the queen, and on our western skirts, Instant, insulted Portugal uprears His warlike standard, in the queen's behalf; While, from the south, the hordes of Africa Again win footing on our weakened lines. Then our new liegeman puts his oath aside, With the same readiness he put it on, And rises in our midst a dangerous foe, Made more audacious by his treachery. Say to your master that my lord, the king, Treats with his rebels at the lance's point, Nor ever recognized, nor ever will, Don Manuel's right to treat by embassy. Take back the trinkets you designed for meâ Don Manuel's needs will shortly ask for them; And tell him, Leonor de Guzman loves No title in the spacious gift of man, Above the welfare of her native land. Am. Must this be final? Leo. Yes, sir; 't is the fruit Of many a painful hour of solemn thought,â Of many a struggle with a treacherous heart, Whose passions threatened to be paramount. Am. Lady, with your reply my functions cease. Now, as a gentleman of Spain, I say That your refusal of this proffered crown Rivals in splendor the ambitious gift, And dims its jewels with your eloquent breath. She who next wears the honors you put by Must sit beneath you in real dignity. Humbly I take my leave. [Kisses her hand, and exit with his suite.] (Solemn music, tolling of bells, and cries of grief, are heard.) Leo. What sounds are these That so appal me, like the uplifted voice Of direful prophecy? (Enter Don Enrique and Don Fadrique, followed by Coronel and CaÃ±edo.) Enrique. Mother! Leo. My son!â And thou, twin brother to my eldest born! The hour that made your difference in birth, Makes none within my heart. En. Mother! Fadrique. Alas! En. O God! be doubly dear to us a while, Or fate will crush us! Leo. SonsâEnriqueâspeak! What is this mystery? En. Mystery! Would 't were so, And not so plain before my shrinking soul! Tell her, good brother. Fad. Didst thou speak to me? Leo. This cruelty is not usual with you, sons.â The king, the king!âWhere is your father? En. Look, Through the wide casement, on yon mournful host!â The trailing pikesâthe furled emblazonry Of our victorious standardsâthe bowed heads Of veterans who behold each other's scars Channels for running tears, without surpriseâ The empty saddleâ Leo. 'T is thy father's steed, Roderick, the last of the old Gothic strain; Oft have I held him by his golden bit, Against Alfonso's spurring.â En. Mother, mother, Thou dreamest, mother. Wake! the kingâ Leo. The king? Well, well, the king is ill?âis wounded?âHa! Where is the king? En. He's dead! Leo. No, no! [Faints.] All. Dead! dead! En. Fadrique, loose her collar. She revives. O, bitter waking to a world of woe! Leo. Some oneâthou, thou, Enrique, was it not?â Brought me a message from my lord the king. En. Many.â Leo. Thou dar'st not tell me he is dead? Thou wouldst behold a helpless woman quake? Such words are treason while the sovereign lives. En. Alas! Leo. And thou believ'st it? En. From these armsâ For there were few who dared confront the plagueâ That mighty champion of Christendom Took flight for heaven. Leo. Dear Lord! and is it so? I feel somewhat bewildered in my mind, And what I see is hardly in clear view, Though I see muchâmuchâmuchâ [Walks about wildly.] En. Awake, poor heart! Nay, slumber on. Her smitten sense is numb, And reason sits not upright on his throne. But we, Fadrique, have beheld such things, As might parch up the tearful eyes of grief With flaming anger. Fad. Yes; and 't is no time To stand before our fate with idle hands. Mother, the liberty and lives of all Whom thou call'st children are in jeopardy: Inaction will undo us. En. Speak to us! Dear mother, thou hast sorrows that pass cure, But there are other wounds that need thy aid. Leo. What said your grace? Fad. The king is dead, good mother. Leo. Ay, I know that. En. And all the smothered hate Of Alburquerque, and the wolfish queen, Begins to darken in each face we see. Leo. Where is the king? Fad. Dead. Leo. Then what help have we? Or what worse fortune can befall? Why, we May sit and laugh, like beggars, in our rags, At the rich trappings which men fear to lose. En. Such desperation would disgrace a man, Yet it shows sweetly in thee, mother. I, Who hold the duties of an eldest son, Must not so far forget the blood I bear, As to sit sobbing o'er my father's corpse, While ruin seizes on his heritage. Fly to thy order, brother. I believe Santiago's banner can protect its master, Until I rally our undoubted friends. Tello, take horseâI need not bid thee spurâ And bear Fadrique company. Away! Fad. Thy blessing, mother. Leo. God protect you both! [Exeunt Fadrique and Tello.] Enrique, thou misjudgest: I am patientâ Quite patientâready to be ruled by thee; Only ask nothing may proceed from me; Do with me as thou wilt. (Solemn music. Enter Soldiers with the bier of King Alfonso.) O heaven! myâsovereign! Husband, I nearly said: but I'm a widow,â Or was years since, before Alfonso's day,â And the old term comes easily to my lips. Besides, Alfonso loved that name from me, When we were jesting.âAy, that corpse could jest: You would not think it, now, to look at him. Forgive me, friends, for slandering your king. En. O mother, mother, put these toys away, And bless the swords that must be drawn for thee. Leo. No swords for me.âYet, dear Enrique, do That which seems best, without a thought of me. My lord of Lara, you were guardian, Under the gracious orders of the king, Of my poor person;âwhat would you advise? Lara. Shut up the castle. You have power enough To bide a two-years' siege from half Castile. En. I like the counsel. Leo. Governor Coronel, Shut up our castle. Coronel. Not till I am forth. I have some pressing business in Seville. CaÃ±edo. The only sane reply thou ever madest! [Apart to Coronel.] En. Now, thou ungrateful traitor, were it not For the most sacred presence of the dead, I 'd buffet thee! Cor. Peace, bastard! you may have Some fair occasion in an open field. [Throws down his key of office, and exit, with CaÃ±edo.] Leo. Our friends fall off with little shaking, son. My lord of Lara, as our deputy, [Offering the key.] We here present our castle's key to you. Lara. Forgive me, lady: a neglected order, Urging my instant presence at Seville, Is two days old with me. [Exit with Villena.] En. Return, false Lara, And, on my father's bier, I'll offer up Thy faithless body to his angry ghost! (The Courtiers, Knights &amp;c., gradually drop out, talking eagerly, and leave Leonor, Enrique, and the soldiers, with the body.) You skulking villains, cannot you remain? First Courtier. I 'm most obnoxious to the plague, my lord;â My father died of it. [Exit.] Second Courtier. And mine. [Exit.] Third Courtier. And mine. [Exit.] En. Yet left the plague-spot in your very souls, You nest of sickly cowards! Shame, sir knight! I saw you win those rowels, that so ring Disgrace behind you, in a battle-field! Knight. But not to lose them in a broil. [Exit.] Leo. (Approaching the bier.) Alack! Blame not the leaves for falling with the trunk. Here lies in death the noble tree from which Castilian honor drew its only sap. Alas! thy branches sheltered noisome weeds, That sucked their living from thy generous roots; And thou didst drop o'er them thy healthful dews, And smiled, as if thou 'dst nurtured gentle flowers. When such as he o'erturn, the world around Is strewn with ruin. Son, depart at once: Gather thy friends; or, shouldst thou fail, perchance, Then, join me in Seville. My mind is clear, And wholesome blood runs through my veins again. En. Mother, I'll keep with thee: there 's time enough. Leo. Where goes the body, friend? Soldier. Towards Seville. Leo. Thither go I. Alfonso, love like mine Ne'er takes a parting e'er the shroud is on. Faithful to thee, I followed thee through lifeâ Faithful, I follow through the shades of death! (Solemn music. Exeunt Soldiers with the body, followed by Leonor and Enrique.) ACT II. SCENE I. A Street in Seville. Enter a knot of Citizens. First Citizen. Her grand-aunt was a conjurer, and madeâ Second Citizen. An ass of you. I see no witchcraft there. First C. Why, youâ Third Citizen. Be civil. Fair words are fair gifts. First C. I say, her grand-aunt was a conjurerâ Second C. So are not you. Third C. Well, patience hears long tales: But let us listen. First C. And she made, they say, A magic girdleâ Second C. Girth for her said assâ Being a stumbling beast; and to the girth She fixed a bladder full of solid lies, That rattle, like the coxcomb of a fool, Whene'er the said ass jogs. Third C. O! neighbors, neighbors, Wit is a sword, and wrangling feeds the leech. First C. I heed him not. Second C. 'T is not for lack of ears. You are a foul kind of chameleon, Who live upon the floating breath of slander; You 'd go a journey to bring home a lie, And be so fattened on it, e'er you came, Your wife would scarcely know you. You pass life In raking up such shreds of calumny As none will own, things men cast out of doors, With stealthy blushes: yet you treasure them, And hang your filthy garbage in our sight, As if the saints had worn it. Give report Stamp base enough, and 't is your current coin; While honest gold you smell at, and return. You 'd believe Judas when he spoke in jest, Yet doubt the true Apostles on their oaths. If you had any seeds of goodness in you, I 'd rake you over, but I 'd make them sprout! First C. Pray, have you done, or are you out of breath? Third C. Let Satan give instruction to his own. An angry teacher trains a stupid school; And so, farewell! Short partings give short pains. [Going.] Second C. Well said, brown wisdom! I will give him o'er, If you'll return. I'll miss your sentences; They come like texts into a dull discourse, Seasoning the matter with a taste of heaven. Third C. Thank you 's soon said. Our gossip's patient, too, And that moves mountains. Fourth Citizen. Let us have the tale. First C. Nay, if he snub meâ Second C. I will not, in faith. Lie on,âI'll listen, if I can't believe. First C. Well, the grand aunt of DoÃ±a Leonor Was an enchantress, and could make the stars Go backward in their orbits.â Second C. Did she ever? First C. I know not; but she could. Second C. I'd have the proof. Third C. Apt swearers are apt liars. Second C. True, indeed; I break my promise. First C. So, one night, she made A wondrous girdle, from the inner skin Of maiden's hearts that broken were of love.â Second C. A rare material! First C. Then she took the belt, And held it o'er the infernal fumes, untilâ Second C. She sneezed, and dropped it in? First C. No, no, indeed; Till it became invisible to allâ Second C. That I believe. First C. Save her who wears it. And this girdle she, In a dark hour, gave DoÃ±a Leonor; Saying, its magic had the power to hold In abject love whatever man she willed. She chose Alfonso.â Second C. She struck high at once. But why not choose him, ere he chose the queen? First C. The belt was not then fashioned. Second C. And they sayâ Let me take up your storyâthat at times, In the full moon, when fools are very rife, This magic girdle presses her about, And doth so burn her with infernal flames, That she cries out, in direful agonyâ Curses her aunt, as if she were no kin, And saysâ[Pauses.] All. O, Lord! what says she? Second C. Things like thisâ âI can tell asses, if I hear them bray!â Who shall want audience for a silly tale? The loveliest woman on Castilian earth, The gentlest dame that ever drew our airâ She, the epitome of excellence, The flowering top and glory of her sexâ She to be rated as a sorceress, By filthy rascals whose best breath would be An insult to her presence! Get you home, And grind your knee-balls to the very bones, In thanks to her, and prayers for your base selves!â Foh! you are odious. [Exit.] First C. There 's a fellow for you!â A very infidel, who scarce believes In sorcery itself. The rude-tongued fool! Would I had throttled him! This comes, I trow, Of home-bred ignorance. I 've been to Romeâ Ay, and to Parisâwhere I 've seen more witchesâ Real sturdy witches, young and old, forsoothâ Burnt at the stake, upon a holiday, Than I have fingers to these fellow hands. I tell you, one timeâ (Enter a Citizen hastily.) Fourth C. What 's the news, good friend? Fifth Citizen. Gibraltar is surrounded by the king, And must surrender ere another week. The plague has broken outâ All. The plague! the plague! Third C. Who told you so? Fifth C. One from Gibraltar. All. (Running from him.) Ha! First C. Out of our sight! thou villain, as thou art, To speak with clean men! Take thy plague away, Or we'll fall on thee! Fifth C. I am sound. First C. Thou liest! Thou 'rt one great sore. Fifth C. Indeed, I feel not well. Third C. Caution 's a famous doctor: I'll be off. Better go laughing, than remain to weep. [Exit.] Fifth C. Pray, friends, assist me! I 've a burning pain Across the temples, andâ All. The plague! the plague! First C. Thou desperate wretch, to issue from thy house In this condition! Bear thy malady Back to thy wife and children, like a Christian. Nay, if thou 'lt not be going, I'll away. [Exit with the others.] (ReÃ«nter Second Citizen.) Fifth C. O! I shall perish! [Lies down.] Second Citizen. What's the matter here? Ill, and no creature nigh! What is it, friend? Fifth C. I tell you frankly, sir, because you speak From a kind heart, I have the plague. Second C. Poh, poh! You 're clean as snow. I feel no fever here.â Fifth C. 'Sdeath! do not touch me! Second C. What an eye you have! Clear as a sunbeam. Let me see your tongue. Thou move compassion by thy false diseaseâ Stir a man's heart to pity by thy groans! Thou arrant beggar, art thou not ashamed To face detection? Fifth C. On my life, I feel A deal improved by your encouragement. [Rises.] The pain has left my head.â Second C. Not yet a while; Thou 'lt feel it shortly. (Strikes him.) Has the fit returned? Impostorâcounterfeitâsham plague! [Beating him.] Fifth C. O!âO! Second C. I'll teach thee to act Lazarus in the streets, For my annoyance! Get thee to thy home, And play thy pranks before thy intimates; Or I will cudgel all the flesh from thee, And drive thee homeward in thy naked bones! Out, thou flea-bitten, verminating rogue! [Exit, beating him out.] SCENE II. The Same. The Throne-Room in the Alcazar, meanly furnished. Enter Don Pedro and his Page, in poor attire. Don Pedro. Offered thee alms! Page. Fair alms, a silver crown, As I was standing at the palace-gate, Sunning my rags. It would have moved your mirth, To have seen the dews on Leonor's long lashes, As she held out the coin, and murmured forthâ âPoor boy!â Don P. But when was this? Page. A month ago, Ere she departed. Don P. What was your reply? Page. A simple bow. For, seeing my best hose Was somewhat airy, and my doublet's sleeve Needed a patch, to keep my elbow in, My cap a roof, to keep the weather out,â Seeing that crowns, with us, are not so rife As figs in August,âseeing no one saw,â I made my bow, and slipped the silver piece Into my bottomless pocket; whence it slid Down my rent stocking, without accident, And firmly settled in my tattered shoe, From which I drew it. Don P. By this merry light, I'm followed by a beggar! Page. Please your grace, I am the only beggar fool enough To do such following. Don P. Marry, that is truth! No lighter, though, because it turns a jest. Page. If nothing happen, master, we shall starve Before we reach another crown. Don P. In sooth, I am sick of jesting. Let us fly my hawk. Page. The ragged tercel that takes all our wealthâ My rent-roll and your princely revenueâ To keep in sparrows? Master, we'll retrench; Sell our gray hawk, and buy a hobby-horse. I'll dance the morrice, and you'll ride the horse, With an alms-pipkin at your saddle-bow. Why, come, this looks like living! Don P. Leave thy jests, Or I will fit thee with a cap and bells! Page. 'T would puzzle you. Besides, I like your offer; The coxcomb covers many a better head; And 't is my right. Am I not jester, cousin, Page, Chamberlain, grand Usher of both wands, Master of hawks, and Keeper of the robes, Purveyor of the forests and the floods, Lord Treasurer, chief Cup-bearer, the Guardâ Captain and soldiersânavy, and what not, All crammed in one, and salaried at two pence, In legal coinage of our father's realm;â Both pennies payableâwhen I can get them? Answer that question. Don P. Thou 'rt a silly boy; And I scarce better, for indulging thee. Here comes the queen, my mother. Look, your tongue Be on its guard, or you may lose its use. Page. And Alburquerque, with his ugly head Scheming and plotting for the sorry body That cannot hold it upright. There 's a man Who'll crawl in hell, if he may strut on earth; Who sees our nature through his darkened soul, And charges mankind with more infamy Than priests impose on Satan. Mark, your grace, Here 's Alburquerque to the life. (Mimics him.) Don Pedro, Go not abroad; there 's a danger in the wind. Lie not abed; sleep leagues with murderers. Eat not, nor drink; for so is poison taken. Smell not a rose; I 've known them venomous. Stay here with me; and let me tutor you That all God's blessings really are but curses, In pleasant masquerade; and thatâ (Enter DoÃ±a Maria and Alburquerque, behind.) Alburquerque. Well, boy! Page. Well, man! Alb. Go to! you 're pert. Page. Not I, my lord: I only told my master what a world You and the devil would have made of this, Had you but shaped it, and not heavenly art. Alb. Sirrah!â DoÃ±a Maria. My lord, leave Pedro to his page: My son has spoilt him. Alb. I'll remember though. Conspiracy doth cackle in that egg; 'T will walk full-feathered shortly. DoÃ±a M. If the kingâ Alb. Beseech you, madam, walk aside a step; The page may overhear us. DoÃ±a M. No, my lord! About my wrongs I will be loud enough, For heaven cries with me. Would that all Castile Might turn its ear upon its queen's distress, Till silence, horrified at what it hid, Found tongues to echo me! Look round you, here: Know who I am, Queen of Castile and Leonâ Wife to a king, and daughter to a kingâ Whose earliest hours knew naught but royal state, Whose toys were crowns and sceptres, whose young feet Tottered along the carpet of a throne, Or slept among its pillows; who was taught To hold myself a sacred thing, apart From the pollution of humanityâ A something, stationed between God and man, Nearer divinity than dust;âthen say, This fiction of a crown, this dearth of power, This squalid court, this cold neglect, this want Of the surroundings that belong to me, Fit the bare title which is mine by right Of Heaven's bestowing, by my royal birth, By marriage, and by general consent! Alb. Madam, I do not. DoÃ±a M. No, nor this alone. Forget my rank, and call me only wife To a Castilian gentleman; then judge If there 's a hind, within the scope of Spain, Whose amours match the shameless insolence Of Don Alfonso's! Sins like his are done Under the wicked covering of night, Or hid in caves and dens from blushing day; But heâhe puts his crown upon his guilt, And makes it pompous in his regal robes, Sets up its statue in the market-place, And calls the world to witness! These things glare; They are not sobered with a mere regret. He ranks his haughty bastards in my sight, Beggars the state to give them revenues, Commands and titles; while the sole command He lays on Pedro is to call them brothers! You, sir, are learned in vices; tell me, now, Is there his mate in all your histories? Alb. Your grace, the actions of a sovereign Look not to history for precedent, Nor recognize the rules of private men. A kingâ DoÃ±a M. May turn mankind to hypocrites, Throw down the barriers between right and wrong, And root heaven's kingdom from the earth! Alb. O, no! The Church has virtuesâ DoÃ±a M. Which it keeps at home, For fear their fashion has run out of date! When has the Church took cognizance of this, Or crooked its finger at the king or her? That witch of Guzmanâpah! it scalds my tongue To spit her name outâhas kept open court, More dazzling than the Persian's brightest dream, Crowded with suitors, over-run with wealth: A place where honor brought his golden spurs,â Naught valued till they glittered in her eyes,â Where poets sang, where orators discoursed, Where learning trimmed and lit his patient lamp, Where art drew inspiration from fair lips, Where warriors showed their scars, where gentle peace Nestled in luxury, where Fame, herself, Stood, as upon the summit of a hill, And thence took flight towards heaven. Ah! sir, 't was here The Church so placidly laid by its cross, Its austere brow, its awful book of laws, And entered, gambolling like a reveller, With looser jests than it could find within. Thou hear'st this, Pedro? Don P. Yes, with sorrow, mother. DoÃ±a M. No, no; with fury! for thy mother's blood Burns hot in thee; and all the memories Of twenty years are smouldering in thy veins, Against the day of reckoning. When thou 'rt king, Dole out thy mercies like the summer's dew, But pour thy vengeance like the winter's hail; And on these bastards, and their hated dam, Fall in consuming fire! Page. There 's good advice! Quite motherly and queenly, and designed, No doubt, for furtherance of the general good. Would I were old! The coming generation Have more before them than they reckon on. [Aside.] DoÃ±a M. Speak, Pedro, speak! Don P. I may do wrong, perhaps, Out of the nature which belongs to me; But, on my soul, I will not meditate My crimes beforehand. DoÃ±a M. Art thou son of mine? Alb. Beware! you tamper with a brand of fire; Look, at which end you grasp it. [Apart to DoÃ±a Maria.] DoÃ±a M. True, in faith! The fruit must ripen ere we press its juice. [Aside.] My lord, you had some tidings of the king; Lay them before us. Lo! I take my state, Queen of Castile and Leon! (Sits upon a low stool.) Is it well, Ha, Pedro? Gentlemen, keep back the press! Our loyal people crowd so thickly on us, We have scant breathing-room! Ha! ha! 'fore Heaven, I can be merry with my misery! [Laughing.] Say on, Don Juan. Alb. The old news renewed: Battles and Moors, but always victory. The infidel holds Spain by one bare rock, And that seems shaking. Ere the week be out, We may have tidings of Gibraltar's fall. There 's little fighting; for the plague has raised His spotted banner 'twixt the hostile camps, And both stand still before him, all aghast, Owning the coward. DoÃ±a M. Should the plagueâWell, well, I trust the king isâwell? Page. 'T was uttered ill. [Aside.] Alb. Quite well, and confident of victory. Don P. Would I were by his side! DoÃ±a M. Thou, thou, indeed, A lawfully-begotten son of mine! Thy birth doth lack the charming quality Of sinful love. Wert thou a bastard, now, A brat of Guzman, thou shouldst bear a sword, And buckle thee in steel, and back a steed;â Haply, to knock thy legal brother's brains Out of his crown, some day! Don P. O, mother, cease! This heartless jesting is beneath thy rank. Come, comrade, let us to the fields again; The fields have better counsel than the court. God's breath comes to us on the straying gales, And whispers peaceful love to us, and all. There 's something wrong, something at war with Heaven, In man's society: I know not why, But still I feel it. Page. I could weep a year. My jests are over, for to-day at least. (As they are about going, enter a Messenger, hastily. Don Pedro and the Page return.) Alb. What news?âwhat news? Messenger. The king is dead. DoÃ±a M. (Starts up.) Ha! ha! [Laughing.] My hour has come, at last! Don P. O, heavens! [Weeps.] Page. Kind saints! Is that the way our wives receive our deaths? [Aside.] DoÃ±a M. Ha! ha! [Laughing.] Alb. Dear madam!â DoÃ±a M. Shall I not laugh out? This is the hour I 've waited on for years. For this I bore his insults, and the mock Of public pity. 'T was for this I bore My lady Leonor's magnificence, Her smiles, her nods, her very companyâ And did not send my dagger through her heart! I knew just Heaven would grant it in good time,â I prayed for it,âand it has come at last! Shall I not laugh! [Laughing.] Page. Does not the devil too? [Aside.] DoÃ±a M. Pedro, my son, awake! Don P. I am an orphan! DoÃ±a M. So are the bastards! let that comfort thee. There 's not a cobweb 'twixt us and our foes. Now strike! while they are stunned with feeble grief; And let the blow that blinds them, clear thy sight. Alb. Madam, I pray you, leave the king to me; I'll bend, but you will break him. [Apart to her.] DoÃ±a M. Yes, the kingâ All hail, King Pedro! Thank you for the word!â I shall go crazy! [Walks about.] Page. Here 's a pretty school To put a child to! [Aside.] Alb. Please, your majestyâ Don P. The king is dead! [Weeping.] Alb. The office never dies: And it behooves your grace to look abroad, And see what ground your kingdom stands upon. I would not urge it, at a time like this, Were not your kingdom's peace embraced in it. The sons of Leonor have great estates, Peopled with warlike vassals, and their mother Is of a subtle wit, and used to rule. They'll not go down without a sturdy tug; And down they must go, or you cannot reign. DoÃ±a M. Listen, my son. Don P. I hear. Let me begin My novel sway by striking close at hand. Madam, I charge you, on your loyalty, To hold my father's memory in respect. DoÃ±a M. He never loved thee, Pedro. Don P. The more cause Have I to mourn his early taking off: Time and good actions might have won his love. Mother, be decent in thy widowhood, Or I may grieve thee. DoÃ±a M. Pedro, speak not thus, With knitted brows and gloomy threats, to me. Thou art the only thing I truly love. Through all the sorrows I have passed, thy voice Was solace to me, and thy growing form Consoled the dwarfish aspect of my fate. Thou canst not tell what I endured, to reach The triumph of the hour that makes thee kingâ What anxious days, and what unslumbering nights! But with my love for thee, another passionâ Sustained by all I saw, or heard, or thoughtâ Grew side by side; a deadly, blasting hate For Leonor de Guzman and her brood Of upstart bastards! Render them to meâ 'T is the sole boon I'll ever claim from thee; Make me their destiny, as they have made Thy mother their chief victim. Don P. Madam, no! Her children are my brothers, and her fate Rests on the future actions of her life. [Walks up with Alburquerque.] DoÃ±a M. Curse him, just Heaven, and make his mercy turn To ceaseless torment! May his brothers be Traitors to him, as he has been to me!â Gall in his goblet, nightmares in his sleep, Goads to his crimes, and clogs to his good deeds; Till restless anguish arm his desperate hand With fratricidal fury! Grant it, Heaven!â Nay, gracious saints, undo my impious curse! My wrongs have maddened me. O, Pedro, Pedro, Fate chose my bitterest moment from this hour! Don P. (Advancing with Alburquerque.) If 't is your thought that DoÃ±a Leonor May raise the horrors of a civil strife, 'T were prudent you restrained her liberty, With due respect. Alb. O, yes, your majesty, With due respect. [Laughs aside] DoÃ±a M. Will she to prison then? Alb. (Drawing Don Pedro aside.) Besides, I could not answer for her care, Were she at large. The queen will now have friends, And friends have daggers, andâ Don P. No more of this. Take you her guardianship. Alb. As for her sons, They may be trusted till they show their teeth. I'll have my spies about them. 'T were not well To start with too much rigor, till we know What power we wield. For harshness, please your grace, Might swell the faction 'gainst yourself, by those Who now stand neutral, balanced either way, And easily won by clemency. The mass, In all great kingdoms, is composed of such; And parties feel it, when it wills to throw Its mighty weight into the doubtful scale. [Don Pedro yawns.] I weary you?âI see I do, your graceâ Pray, do I not?âI tire you with these things? If I do not, I miss my own design. [Aside.] Don P. 'T will be your interest to uphold the throne Through which you rule; therefore, I trust to you. Alb. (Bowing.) Sage boy! [Aside.] Don P. Retain the powers my father gave, Yet breathe my childish mercy through your acts. I seem to be the only mourner here; Let me go grieve. [Walks apart.] DoÃ±a M. She will to prison then? O, bless my fortune, that had this in store! Alb. Ay, and forever. See how policy Wins, piece by piece, that which your heady force Could never compass. Madam, you must be More circumspect and gentle with your son. I know his nature, and can mould its wax To any shape you purpose. But take heed Of sudden passions, and displays of wrath. (Enter Coronel and CaÃ±edo.) DoÃ±a M. Whom have we here? Alb. Alonzo Coronel, Welcome! What brings you to Seville? Coronel. My lord, I come to be enrolled among your friends. Alb. The tide has turned. (Apart to Maria.) Sir, your alacrity Is your best commendation. Were you not, Some time, the Guzman's governor? Cor. I was, Till duty taught me where allegiance lay. CaÃ±edo. Poh! how you talk! 'T was simply thus, my lord: He flung his key at DoÃ±a Leonor, Called Don Enrique bastard, and ran off. There 's a short story! Alb. Its reward shall come. We here create you lord of Aguilar, Giving the flag and cauldron of a Don, With all the privileges of Rico Hombre. [To Coronel.] Cor. CaÃ±edo, this o'ertops the Guzman's wall. [Apart to him.] I brought my friend, tooâan unsightly thing; But, then, my lord, I brought him not for showâ As my best offering. He can bite and hold, A very wolf in battle. CaÃ±. If that be The character you give before my face, Heaven save my back, Alonzo! Alb. I accept him, At your good word, and will provide for him. Who 's governor now? Cor. Lara refused the charge. Alb. Ha! Lara? This is golden news! Cor. And mark, The lord of Lara following its report. (Enter Lara and Villena.) Alb. Welcome to both! Good gentlemen, your speed Is cheerful notice of your fair intents. (A number of Courtiers, Knights, &amp;c., assemble at the back of the scene.) Madam, the bees are swarming. (Apart to Maria.) We have need Of faithful men to fill our offices. We take it as an honor that such names As Lara and Villena can be placed Topmost upon the ranks of government. Lara. Thanks, Alburquerque! Though our motives be, As you may rate them, selfish at the base; Yet while your government has power to stand, By our joint efforts, we shall not fall off. Alb. Your candor pleases me. Madam, behold, How one short hour has changed the face of things! These moths, that flutter round our brightening lamp, Are, singly, little but mere silk-spinners; Yet, by a skilful knitting of their work, I'll form a cable that shall hold Castile Fast at our anchor. Smile, for Heaven's sake, smile! Sunshine costs nothing, and its gift may bring Abundant harvest. [Apart to Maria.] DoÃ±a M. Smile on these, too, sir? (Enter Leonor de Guzman and Don Enrique.) Would that my eyes had venom in their light, And every glance had power to slay a host! You should not lesson me in smiling, then, Even on these. How now, thou sorceress, Has witchcraft failed thee? Dar'st thou set thy foot, Insolent minion, in our very court? Enrique. Madam!â Leonor. Enrique, give me leave to speak. DoÃ±a M. What, thou wouldst whine of love to King Alfonso, Gloss o'er thy sins with lying rhetoric, And set heaven blushing at the gifts it gave! Leo. No, madam, no: though something might be said, Of how the holy law of mutual love May wipe the slander from a life like mine. Not for myself I come. The fatal day That took Alfonso turned my eyes from life, And the tame hum and bustle of the world. The hours that lie between me and my grave I count, as one who waits some great event Beside a dial, and would urge the shade That towards his hope creeps tardily along. DoÃ±a Maria, it is not with you I would discourse, but with his grace, the king. DoÃ±a M. Doubtless, thou crafty trickster, not with me,â Who traced thy winding courses, year by year, Marking each footstep with some wrong of mine,â But with the king, whose unsuspicious mind Needs my sad talisman against thy arts. Thus, as his mother, I arise between Thy guilty purpose and his gentle heart! Leo. I have no purpose but to intercede For King Alfonso's children; and the voice Of nature, pleading louder than my own, Shall win Don Pedro to his brothers.â DoÃ±a M. Shame! Hast thou the impudence to call thy crew Of vipers brothers to my son? Leo. Ay, madam, Haply, if you were honest with the king. DoÃ±a M. Ha! lady, art thou of so keen a wit? Arrest her! En. (Drawing.) He who touches but her garb, I'll hew to atoms! Alb. Folly has run mad. Madam, yourâ DoÃ±a M. Treason! Cut the bastard down! (Alburquerque rushes back to Don Pedro. The Courtiers draw and advance on Leonor and Enrique.) Don P. (Mounting the throne.) Forbear! I am the sovereign in Castile! And till your treason root me from my seat, You who thus jet shall flourish under me! (Courtiers uncover, and fall back.) Alb. (To Maria.) Here is a sermon on my text, your grace. This headlong course will run you out of breath: Excessive anger is the blindest thing That e'er sought vengeance. Patience, patience, madam! Wait till the reins are fairly in our hands, And the state ambling gently under us; I'll show you tricks, then, when the king 's not by I'll strip these Guzmans for you, root and branch. But you must smileâa very heavenly smileâ Or shed a tear or two, perhaps, while they Lie at your feet, and wither in your hate. Begin, begin! DoÃ±a M. Don Pedro, pardon me. The open insult of my fellow-queenâ She who was reigning while I staid at home, To rock your cradle, and to suckle youâ Moved me a little. And besides, my liege, There are some years of suffering on my brow,â Pray, mark my lady's, it is very smooth,â And some harsh lines of silver in my hair, While hers is glossy with untroubled ease. The rose has burned to ashes on my face;â Yet lives again in her transparent cheek. She can go through her fingers, and record A loving child upon each dainty tip;â I have but one, and he forgets to love! Don P. Mother, thou wrong'st me. For the love of grace, I prithee lay this bitterness aside, Sweetening thy nature with more holy thoughts. Enrique, brother, I will not suppose You are unmindful of the love we shared In great Alfonso's heart; nor that one grief, For his untimely loss, together binds us. While you preserve allegiance to the king, You shall not suffer for the brother's love. Leo. I humbly thank your grace; and to your care Commit your father's children. DoÃ±a M. (Apart to Alburquerque.) Shall she triumph? Alb. Can she stop time, or stretch this lucky hour Out into doomsday? [Apart to Maria.] Don P. My lord Chancellor, To your safe-keeping we confide the person Of DoÃ±a Leonor. And see no harm Come to the lady, in whatever shape, On pain of our displeasure; nor such rights, As by the law have been allowed to her, Be now denied her. En. How is this, my lord? Alb. Reasons of state forbid the libertyâ At least, the perfect liberty, I ownâ Of DoÃ±a Leonor. His majesty Fears somewhat for his mother's jealousy,â Sir, there are knives and poison in the land,â [Whispers.] And, therefore, gives her to my custody. En. I can protect her, if 't is that you fear. I like it not. Don Pedro, you undo Your royal mercy. Alb. CondÃ©, be content; You shall be free to come and go to her. We do not mean this for imprisonment. En. And so you gild the cage! Ah! sirâ Leo. My son, Bow with obedience to thy king's command. It matters little where I dwell to me, Still less to all the world. Thy liberty Is warrant for my safety. En. Let but a hairâ Look, Alburquerque, what I say to youâ Let but a hair be rent from that fair head, And I willâ Leo. Thou art passionate. My lord, I must intrust my person to your charge;â For, to be frank, I see no fair escape. Lord Alburquerque, we are not new friends, We have met often; and I understand Your wily policy and cunning turns, Almost as well as you who practise them. Alb. Ward, this is somewhat bluff. Leo. But true, my lord. My children's welfare rests upon my hands, And I must rise, with all my weight of grief, To wait upon their fortunes. Be but true, And I will meet your candor with like truth; But should you practise on me, art for art, And scheme for scheme, shall meet you everywhere. I shall be jealous of your guardianship, And give the king a fair account of it, By ways you cannot see. Alb. (Aside.) Ha! ha! my lady, This looks like brisk employment! Brain to brain We'll fight our battle: I'll outwit you, though;â Trust me for that. Leo. Don Pedro, many thanks, For the great kindness you have shown to me, Now, in my ebb of fortune. Let me be Among the first to hail you on the throne.â Long live Don Pedro, King of fair Castile! All. Long live the King of Leon and Castile! [Flourish.] ACT III. SCENE I. The Same. A State-Apartment in the same. Enter DoÃ±a Maria and Alburquerque. DoÃ±a Maria. School me to patience! Make me one of those Who pander to the Guzmans' growing power! My lord, you promised me their overthrow; And while your promise kept its aspect fresh, I waitedânone more patientlyâtill time Should fill the crescent which I kept in view. What have you done?âHeaped wealth unlimited, New offices, new honors, new commands, Upon my foes; until the blazonry Of your additions has so charged their shields, As almost to conceal the left-hand bar. This is your work, and this is my revenge! Alburquerque. 'T is the beginning. You have seen a hawk Mounting the heavens, to strike his rising prey; When does he wheel, and make the fatal stoop? Not while his quarry towers above his head, But when his wing has won the upper place; And the tired heron, shuddering with affright, Sees the sharp beak and talons of his foe Poising between him and the blue of heaven. The Guzmans rise, but we rise faster, madam, To overtop them in their venturous flight. DoÃ±a M. Words, words! you give me naught but pretty words, And I ask deeds. Alb. You'll have them ere you think. Look at the state in which I found Castile!â A kingdom veined and arteried with plots, Flowing and ebbing, crossing and recrossing, Through every corner of her wide domain. Here Lara, whispering of the royal blood That came to him from the tenth king Alfonso; There Aragon, full of the sweeping claim Of its InfantÃ©, nephew to the king, Your former husband.âHere was cause for strife! But add to this, a hundred haughty lords, Shut up in towns and castles, with demands Upon the crown that grew as days went by.â Not to forget the Moorish war, bequeathed By your great husband to his only son. Madam, this net-work cramped me, hand and foot, Till I burst through it. And I tell you nowâ Even while I hold these elements in checkâ That if King Pedro die, or I but slack My rigid grasp, Castile shall see a storm, To which mere chaos would be harmony. Why, let the boys of DoÃ±a Leonor Strut, fume, and threaten, if they do no more. I'll be the first to find them gilded coats, Until I choose to strip them to the bone! DoÃ±a M. There seems some reason in your policy. And yet myâ Alb. Reason! good lady, were that all! If plain, blunt sense could compass my designs, I'd go to bed at noonday. But the king, He must be pleased with hunting-shows and games, Or vexed with tangled matters of the state,â Talked with and mystified; until for love Of present pleasure, or disgust with rule, He flings his crown into my ready hands. Then, Don Enrique must be found new toys, Before the old ones weary. Even now He scours the country, drumming up old friends, And mustering new allies. And Iâpoor Iâ Must rack my brain for some fresh dancing-jack, To keep him quiet. DoÃ±a M. And the mother, sir? Alb. Ay, ay; I know not what her grace is at. The marriage of her eldest son, I hear, With Don Fernando's sister. DoÃ±a M. So, indeed? Juana shares her prison, and Enrique Visits it daily. Alb. I must look to that. The Guzman is Juana's guardian, By King Alfonso's order, and Biscay The ward's fair portion. Hum! BiscayâBiscay!â A dangerous foe, and a fast friend. That land Breeds natural warriors; the children, there, Teeth on a sword-hilt. I have only given Titles and gewgaws, no effective power; But this Biscay is very solid stuff.â They shall not have it. Here is more to do: Wheedle Fernando, threaten Leonor, And gain possession of Juana. Gods! I am both minister and harlequin,â Head to the state, and jester to the court! Did not the king, Alfonso, pre-contract Enrique with Juana? DoÃ±a M. Surely, sir: There was some stir when he betrothed the two. Alb. I had forgotten. DoÃ±a M. I have not. 'T is one Of the grave matters in my long account Against the Guzman. 'T was a holiday, By the king's order, when the deed was sealed; 'T will be a fast-day ere 't is ratified! Alb. Right, right! Here is FernandoâLara too. (Enter Lara and Villena. Maria retires.) Well met, my lords! Lara, a word with you. [Takes him apart.] There 's a new faction making head, they say, With claims no humbler than the crown itselfâ Your crown, perchanceâthe crown which you may wear, If Pedro die without an heir. In sooth, The king is sickly; and Castile, I trow, Would ne'er accept a king from Aragon. Look to it, Lara. Lara. What new plot is this? Alb. The Guzmans'. Trastamara and Fadrique Are busy marshalling their chiefest friends, And spreading rumors, that Alfonso willed The crown to them, among the multitude. Lara. Upstarts! Alb. Yet powerful. Would it not be well To counterplot among their friends, and crush The seeds of treason ere they take firm root? Lara. It would, indeed. I will about it straight. [Going.] Alb. I'll tell you more, anon. Lara. Thanks, thanks! [Exit.] Alb. That bee Will buzz in Lara's brain for many a day. He and the Guzmans will have merry times, Among themselves, while I look on and laugh. [Aside.] Ah! Don Fernando, 't is a joy to me To see your smiling features in the court. Your sister favors youâand, by the by, Where is that lady? [Taking him apart.] Villena. With her guardian. Alb. Her guardian?âwho, sir? Vil. DoÃ±a Leonor. Her dismal prison, to my sister's eyes, Is the bright spot of Spain. Alb. It is a pityâ A grievous pity! For the king should see Those charms, the churlish maiden hides from him. He must be married.âWell, well!â Vil. Did you say The king designs to marry? Alb. Not to-day. Vil. My sister is betrothed to Don Enrique. Alb. A very grievous pity! Vil. Why, my lord? Alb. His star seems waning. He will scarce out-live The many schemes he is so apt at framing,â Rebellions, murders, and what not. Vil. Good Heaven! Is he a traitor? Alb. 'T is a pity, though! I chose your sister as a proper maid To bring beneath the notice of Don Pedro. In sooth, I might have pushed her excellence Some steps before the others. Well, you say She is betrothed; of course, that ends it all. Vil. My lordâ Alb. I'll not detain you. Vil. If you mean Your choice fell on Juana, as our queen, I see no obstacleâ Alb. Nor I, forsooth: Who could be worthier? Vil. She shall come to court. Alb. That would require a deal of management: For DoÃ±a Leonor can keep her ward, By the Castilian laws, against us all. Ask the king's warrant. Vil. That I will! Alb. And, lo! Here comes his grace to grant it. (Enter Don Pedro from hawking, with a bird upon his fist; accompanied by Enrique, Courtiers, Falconers with hawks, &amp;c.) Don Pedro. Pray you, brother, Give me your hawk. He is a gallant bird; How close his feathers lie! and what a spread Of wing he makes in his audacious flight! There is a head becomes its feathery crest More than black Edward's; and his sinewy neck, Lithe as a serpent's, joins his arching chest Without a break. Mark, how assured a grip His talons take upon my glove! Your hand, Cased in a gauntlet, could not pinch me thus. Give me the bird. Enrique. It flatters me, to think I can bestow a favor on your grace. 'T is only quittance too. Don P. O! marry, yes; He slew my falcon. Alburquerque, hark! Alb. Your grace? Don P. Your gift, the great Burgundian hawk, Was but a haggard, after all your praise. This is my brother's bird. I'll tell you, now, How your Burgundian suffered. For a wager, As to which hawk could strike the quarry firstâ Mine or Enrique'sâwe both cast them off. But the shrewd heron slipped between the two, Dropped like a stone, and left the rivals there, Facing each other, in their topmost flight. A while they paused, and then, 'gainst nature, rushed Grappling together. 'T would have moved your blood, Had you but seen the feathered warriors tilt! Beak threatening beak, and talon locked in talon, Wheeling and darting, striking and retreating, Like two brave jousters at a course of spears, While through the air their riven armor fell In feathery clouds. Now, your Burgundian hawk Waged battle nobly; then, anon, he turned, Turned like a cravenâhad he flown to me, I would have wrung his head offâturned and fled! But Don Enrique's falcon closed, and struck, Straight through the coward's gorge, a deadly blow! âFoul!â cried I; âFair!â Enrique cried; and while We stood there wrangling, down fell Burgundy, Headlong, to earth! [Laughs.] Alb. A battle royal, sire! Worthy the great spectators. Don P. Tell me, nowâ You store your beauty in your country houseâ Who was the fair one that reclined upon Your window-ledge, as we rode forth to-day? Par Dieu! I heard strange music in the air, And smelt new odors, as I gazed upon That wonder, sitting in a haze of light, Which seemed to eddy with my whirling brain, And bring a most delicious sickness o'er me. Alb. Unless your grace may mean my grandmother, Who thinks her charms but ripen with her years, I have no other female, save my ward, Maria de Padilla,âa fair girl, As women go in this world. Don P. Wondrous fair! Alb. (Aside.) Nibbling already! When the time is come That I must look you up a lady-love, To keep your grace from ogling my Castile, Maria shall succeed the hawks and dogs: But hawks and dogs must serve you yet a while. Vil. Your grace, a boon! I ask my sisterâ Alb. (Aside to him.) Hist! Wait till Enrique goes. Don P. Your sister, how? Vil. I must reply. (Aside to Alburquerque.) She is the ward, your grace, Of DoÃ±a Leonor, a prisoner now, And, therefore, not a guardian capable To fill her duties. I demand Juana, Both as her brother, and by right of law. Don P. These are high words. Alb. (Aside to Villena.) Shrink, shrink, or lose your suit! Don P. Is not Juana de Villena free To come and go, without restraint or dread? En. Brotherâ Vil. Your graceâ Alb. Your highnessâ Don P. Gentlemen, This may be zeal, but 't is not courtesy. Enrique, speak. En. He has a brother's eye To some rich lordships in Biscay. Vil. And thouâ Don P. Now, by the light of heaven, you quarrel here, Here, in our presence! Don Fernando, think Where you are standing; and remember, too, He whom you âthou,â with impudent contempt, Is brother to your king! Vil. I pray your graceâ Don P. No more! There 's many a door to the Alcazar, And till your sister may see fit to walk Through one of them, she 's welcome to remain. En. I thank you, brother. Don P. Thank Castilian law, To which we bow, with the same reverence As does the poorest subject in our realm. Alb. Abandon all, and trust your cause to me. [Apart to Villena.] Vil. Needs must,âand so forth. [Aside.] Don P. Ho! break up the court! This scene distempers me. Your arm, Enrique. I am not well. Alb. Room, for the kingâroom, room! [Exit Don Pedro, supported by Enrique, with all the others except DoÃ±a Maria and Alburquerque.] DoÃ±a Maria. You'll never govern him. My son complained, And I must follow. [Exit.] Alb. A headstrong colt, I ownâ A very devil to resist the spur; And yet he may be managed by a hand That feels the bit with caution, and applies His rages to his rider's furtherance. Yes, I can ride him; for one simple reason,â He cannot find his way unless I guide. [Exit.] SCENE II. The Same. A Prison-Room in the same. Leonor de Guzman alone. Leonor. A change from my gay court, a sorry change! Yet what is life but changes? And would not Life's sweetness cloy, without its bitterness? The ebbs and flows of being keep its tides Fresh on the surface, while the central soul, Like some volcano of the under sea, Boils on foreverâon, though storm or calm Rule o'er the outer and apparent floodâ Setting its streams of thought, now here, now there, In purifying motion. I oft think That they whose lives seem calmest to the view, And most unmarked by fortune's varying stamp, Have most turmoil within. For, were it not, Mere want of action would unstring the mind, And settle idleness in idiocy. So let me think, though every thought of mine Move with a shadow of remembered grief; And in my prison, like the close-pent brain, Be still the power that gives free sinews work. I have an influence on the world beyond; And I, who nothing hope from earth's desiresâ I, whose sole hope beacons across the graveâ I, who stand calmly, waiting for God's breath To waft me towards him and his royal guest, The great AlfonsoâI indeed should be A mighty instrument for others' good. Therefore, while life is mine, my sons shall have The best of me. (Enter Juana de Villena.) Good-morrow, gentle daughter! May I address thee thus? This pretty hand Was pledged to my Enrique. Juana. And there rests, In maiden widowhood. Leo. One faithful heart, One miracle of nature, in our midst! Jua. Madam, the heart is sorrowing that the hand Cannot keep faith. Leo. Thou 'rt melancholy then? Thou lov'st the CondÃ©?âthou would'st marry him? Jua. I said so once, with all my strength of soul,â I have not altered since. Leo. Then get thee ready; Thou shalt be married ere the sun go down. Jua. I doubt.âHow can I doubt? Your uttered word Has ever carried the command of fate. Leo. I am quite serious. See, Enrique comes! In faith, I feel a mother's jealousy; I never know to which of us he comes. (Enter Enrique.) Enrique. Mother! [Embraces her.] Leo. Here 's one who has a sweeter claim. En. Forgive me, dear Juana! I have much That will concern you both. Your brother vows To tear you from us, dearest. Leo. And the king?â En. Will not consent. Leo. Then she shall not go hence. En. The king is ill. A sudden malady, Of swift and dangerous seeming, struck him down As he gave audience. All is in confusion, And each man speculates upon his death. The rival claimants for the doubtful crownâ Parties of Lara and of Aragonâ With factious haste, are almost up in arms. Let them get up, and we'll begin to stir. Leo. Heaven spare Don Pedro! En. Frankly, so say I. Just now, our friends are scantily prepared To push our fortunes. Fight or fall we must, Should Pedro leave us. Leo. True. He stood our friendâ Who had most cause to fear usâwith a strength That made his boyish port heroical, When the whole court was thirsting for our blood. Heaven save Don Pedro, therefore! Now, my son, Should the king die, before thy marriage-rites With fair Juana have been solemnized, Thou 'dst miss thy bride. Jua. Let me retire. [Going.] Leo. Come back, Thou arrant runaway! Jua. Indeedâindeedâ Leo. Indeed, indeed, thou art a very woman! [Laughing.] En. Gentle Juana, do I frighten thee? Jua. O! no, my Lord. En. Why dost thou fly me, then? Jua. I do not know. Leo. I do. Nay, tremble not; Our sex's secrets are quite safe with me. But, to be plain, your nuptials are in peril, And, with all secrecy, must be performed Before the day be older. Fashion it To suit yourselves. [Exit.] Jua. Nay, now, do you come back. En. She 's gone, and left thee to thy direful fate,â Alone with one who loves thee! Sweet Juana, How does my mother's purpose seem to thee? Jua. To me? How seems it to your lordship? En. Nay, How seems it to your ladyship? A sigh! It seems to me the summit of my fate, The spot from whence I look on happiness, As on a pleasant land, from some great hill; Just when the Spring is freshest, ere a leaf Curls with the yellowing Summer; while the fruit Is folded in the blossom, and a sun, Rich with the humid promise of the year, Looks through the hazy air, and wraps the whole In dreamy quiet. Dearest, if our lives Assume no brightness from this point of view, Let us turn atheists; for love was given As a foretaste of what the saints enjoy. Jua. More than my ear finds rapture in your words. Ah! sir, this eloquence may tire some day, Or the sweet lips that utter it for me May keep it for another. En. Dost thou croak? Has the mild dove changed voices with the raven? Here 's that at which my lips will never tire. [Kisses her.] (Enter Alburquerque and Villena, with Attendants.) Alburquerque. Caught in the act! En. Ha! sir, do even you Break on my mother's privacy without A customary warning? Alb. I'm short-sighted, But, pray, is that your mother? What a blush! [Laughing.] En. Is it a privilege of prime ministers, To offer insult wheresoe'er they please? Alb. Forgive me, CondÃ©, I am somewhat gay; 'T would be self-cruelty to stop my humor. DoÃ±a Juana, you must come with us. Jua. Why should I come? Alb. (Shaking a paper.) I 've warrant why you should. En. Don Pedro's order? Alb. Ay, sir. Villena. Sister, come: You should not harbor with this base-born tribe. En. You are her brother, and may wag your tongue Without my notice. Jua. Dear Enrique, no! I will not leave for all the kings on earth. As my betrothed, and a Castilian knight, I charge you to protect me from these men! En. While I have life. Without there! [Draws.] (Enter armed Attendants.) Gentlemen, The odds are not so great. Alb. Arrest them both! In the king's name, I order it! [His party advance.] En. Stand back! You that come on so lightly, beat retreat, Or we will drive you! Alb. Forward, for the king! [Draws.] (As the two parties engage, enter between them Leonor de Guzman.) Lenor. What means this clamor? In my lodgings too! Do you, sirs, claim to be half civilized, Or are ye but a pack of wolves? Put up! Think ye I ne'er saw weapons bare before, That you would daunt me? What, Lord Chancellor, Are you the foremost in your own disgrace? For honor's sake, explain! Alb. I have a warrantâ Leo. First let me read it; then I'll understand Your motive in this most disgraceful brawl. Alb. I have a warrant from Don Pedro, madam, To claim the person of your ward, Juana. Leo. And I would read it. Alb. An hidalgo's word Is proof enough. Leo. That very much depends On the hidalgo. Alb. (Aside to Villena.) Damn her cunning! 'Sdeath! We 're trapped already. Understand, I said I'll have a warrantâ Leo. Get your warrant first, And take the lady after. Sir, I know Each turning in that crooked brain of yours; There 's not a labyrinth so full of guile, In all your mind, but I have tracked it out, From its least issue to its turbid source. Give up your treachery, at least with me, And take to downright violence at once. Here I, a guardian by Castilian law, Stand on my rights as a Castilian dame: Now let the proudest lord within the land, Unbacked by orders from the throne itself, Abide the conflict! On this outraged spot, I'll see my household butchered, one by one, Ere I will yield a tittle of my rights! Alb. We are dismissed. 'T were best to go at once. [Aside to Villena.] [Going, he turns back.] I'll have the warrant, though, or lose my head,â Ay, and die talking! Leo. Of all things but heaven. Ah! you shrewd schemer of iniquity, Look that the prodigal plots you send abroad Do not return from feeding with the swine, On husks and offal, to offend their father, While he is sitting in prosperity Among his kindred! Alb. Look you, I will have The warrant! Leo. You shall have the lady, then. Alb. Heaven speed you! We are entered in a race; One or the other shall trip up ere long. [Exit, with Villena and Attendants.] Leo. Now for your marriage! There is not a moment So small, within our reckoning of time, That is not crowded with a thousand checks To us and our design. Some one of you, Seek out my chaplain, with your greatest speed [Exit an Attendant.] Enrique and Juana, deck yourselves For the blessed rites. I will forgive the haste Your toilets may betray. Speed, speed, my loves, And not fine raiment, is our great need now! [Exeunt.] ACT IV. SCENE I. Seville. The Plaza Real. Parties of Soldiers and armed Citizens cross the stage; some crying âLara!â some âFernando of Aragon!â others âTrastamara!â Enter Coronel and CaÃ±edo. CaÃ±edo. Heavens! what a hubbub! Coronel. I have stood in breaches When the air hissed with shafts and javelins, And rang with voices of the engineers Cheering their comrades at the thundering ramsâ When furious swords were hammering horrid din On shield, and helm, and hauberkâwhen great walls And lofty turrets, with incessant crash, Strewed shuddering earth with ruin, far and near;â I 've heard the thunder-clouds, among the hills, Roll as if some Titanic monster drove His ponderous car across their rocky tops;â I 've heard the bellowing ocean send his tides, Goaded to madness by the hurricane, Full forty fathom up the groaning cliffs, Until his spray salted the stooping clouds;â I 've heard a woman scoldâheard thee blasphemeâ Have dreamed of hell, and chaos, and such things;â But never, since I pricked an ear at sound, Heard I the clamor of this frantic town! [Shouts within.] CaÃ±. I'll be as crazy as the best of them. Castile for Lara! Cor. Ho! for Lara, ho! Yell, yell, CaÃ±edoâyell him to the throne! CaÃ±. Now, for my part, I like a quiet fight; I 'd rather split a head than split my lungs. [Shouts within.] Cor. Hear how they roar! (Enter a Soldier.) The newest news, good friend? Soldier. The king is dead. [Exit, hastily.] Cor. That all? I thought the devil Was dead and buried, and his fry broke loose. CaÃ±. I'll bet he lies. Cor. Doubtless. The knave 's too wise To speak the truth without some provocation. Yet, for all that, die young Don Pedro must, If death's grave heralds, the Sevillian doctors, Are to be trusted in their mystery. CaÃ±. Our side is best. Cor. For once thou 'rt in the right. Lara is nearer to the crown than they Who start their adverse claims. Citizens and Soldiers. (Within.) Ho! Lara! Lara! (Enter Lara and Villena, followed by a crowd of Citizens and Soldiers.) Lara. O, curse his treachery! That faithless wretch, Sly Alburquerque, has deserted me, And sides with Aragon. Villena. His reason 's plain; You 're in Seville, and Aragon at home. 'T is time the traitor wantsâtime, only time. Lara. Curse, curse his baseness! CaÃ±. Lara for Castile! Cor. Leave off thy yells, and take to curses, friend; Thou seest 't is the new fashion. Curse Don Juan Alonso de Alburquerque, by each name He got at baptism! CaÃ±. Ay, ten million curses Hunt him to death, and make him peaceable! I'll swear his present life has little ease. Cor. Is the king dead? Vil. Not dead, but dying fast. Cor. Lara for king! Lara. You side with us, brave sir? What shall we do? Cor. Seize on the crown, of course; And when you have it on, let Aragon But reach to pull it off. Vil. Sound counsel, uncle; For were the crown in hand, we 'd strain a while Ere you should lose it. CaÃ±. To the palace, then! Long live King Lara! What 's his christian name? [To Coronel.] Cor. Juanâthou block! CaÃ±. Long live King Juan! Shout! All. Long live King Juan! (Enter a crowd crying, âAragon!â) CaÃ±. Let 's begin our work By cutting these knaves' throats. Cor. Well thought of, faith! Room for the king, or we will tread you down! (The crowd shouts, âCastile for Aragon!â) CaÃ±. Ho! forward, then! [Draws.] Cor. Long live King Juan! On! [All draw.] (As the opposing parties are about to engage, enter Don Pedro, supported between Alburquerque and another Nobleman, followed by Knights, Attendants, Guards, &amp;c.) Alburquerque. Back! you who hold allegiance to the king! All. (Uncovering.) The king! the king! [They fall back.] Don Pedro. What shouts were those we heard? Who cried, âKing Juan,ââwho cried, âAragon,ââ While I, King Pedro, reign? [Staggers.] Alb. (Supporting him.) It was not you, My lord of Lara, certainly not you? You are too modestâif I know your lordshipâ To bellow treason in your own behalf. Lara. It was not I. Alb. Nor Don Fernando, either; His head is too well set upon his neck, To wish it off. Hey, Coronel? Cor. 'T was I. CaÃ±. And I, so please you. Cor. (Aside to him.) Hush thy stupid noise! Keep thy thick tongue away from my affairs! Hearing his grace was dead, and loving so The kingly office, for his royal sake,â As widows who lament a husband's loss By marrying another,âwe bethought us That 't was high time to have another king. Finding the lord of Lara close at hand, We, boiling over with our loyal mood, Cried him for king, with the best lungs we haveâ Much in the fishwives' manner. CaÃ±. (Aside.) There 's a lie To whiten Judas! Alb. So youâHa! ha! ha! [Laughing.] You are the boldest beggar in Castile! Pardon these men, your grace,âbecause, your grace, We dare not slaughter themâthat 's all. [Aside to Don Pedro.] Don P. We do. All. Long live King Pedro! Don P. (Aside to Alburquerque.) I am very ill; Take me away, or I shall swoon. Alb. Bear up! Swoon, and your crown falls off. Lara. What ails the king? Alb. Naught, naught. Your treason has afflicted him; He hides upon my neck his gracious tears. Lean hard on me, your grace. [Aside to Don Pedro.] His grace's health Is quite restored, thank Heaven! though heâstand firm!â(Aside to Pedro.) Is somewhat weakly yet. Get to your homes, I pray you, sirs. I'll send the royal guard, To scour the streets, and shut the rebels up. My resolution cheers your faithful hearts; I see it in your faces. Go, sirs, go! [Exeunt all but the king's party.] 'T is over, please your grace. Nobleman. The king has swooned Alb. Back, to the palace! As you go along, Spread out your mantles, to conceal his grace, And bear him gently through the private door. Should any question you, your best reply Were to knock out the asker's brains. Away!â Gently; forget not, in your haste, you bear All Alburquerque's treasure in your arms. [Exeunt with Don Pedro all but Alburquerque.] What a brave tool is that young king of mine! How he rends treason, when my hand directs! There 's Lara over, spite of all his noise; The other curs, that only barked at him, Have slunk away before my bolder tread, And peace is slumbering o'er the quiet town, Dreaming of bright to-morrow. Dreams and hopes, That steal away the life of silly manâ The sleeping and the waking visionâwhich Is idler, falser, and less oft fulfilled? Now brooding Night has turned the downy side Of her dark wing upon this peaceful hour, And all the world seems drowsy for repose. Perhaps, to-night, even prime ministers May sleep their time out. I will home, and try. [Exit.] SCENE II. The Same. A Room in the Alcazar. Enter DoÃ±a Maria. DoÃ±a Maria. Must the whole purpose of my life be lost, Because a wilful boy is obstinate? Must all the passions which my wrongs evoked, To shape my destiny, subside again Without their natural issue? I am naught, There is no leading motive to prolong My aimless days, unless I find revenge. No heart-struck wight so ached to bless his eyes With the fair creature who bewildered him, As I to see the justice which is mine Rush to its consummation. I have gazed Upon revenge, until it seems a thing Holy as thoughts of heaven; and sure it is Justice, not vengeance, to the eyes above. Suppose I kill her? with my own true hand Sweep her from earth? What could Don Pedro do? Murder his mother? Well, and what of that? He could not call the Guzman back to life; And I 'd die laughing. Ha! 't is a new thought, Yet good and tempting. Could I reach her, now,â Find some occasion. The Alcazar's doors Are shut against me. I must think of this. Ha! ha! it would be rare!âwith my own hand! [Laughing.] (Enter Alburquerque.) Alburquerque. There, madam, that 's the courtly face I like! How well a smile becomes you! DoÃ±a M. But you, sir, Are not the blest occasion of my smile, Your heart must tell you. Alb. At the Guzmans still! DoÃ±a M. No, no; a happy train of gay ideas Gathered in one, and burst into a smile. Had you your enemy beneath your foot, Feeling with one hand where his heart beat most, While in the other gleamed your naked brand, Quivering with eagerness to end the deed,â Would you not smile? Alb. Most likely. DoÃ±a M. Ay, you 'd grin With all the beauty of a tickled fiend. Alb. My beauty thanks you. DoÃ±a M. When will you bestow The vengeance I demand, not as a grace, But as a sacred right? Alb. Patience, a while. DoÃ±a M. Patience forever! thus you put me off. Alb. These Guzmansâby the by, well thought! I'll get my warrant. Sickness has destroyed Don Pedro's power to battle with my voice. I talk him mad. He 'd give the whole broad earthâ Throwing Castile in, as of no accountâ For one short hour of peace. I'll get my warrant. DoÃ±a M. What warrant? Alb. To remove the Guzman's ward Here date the birth, too, of your own revenge. Don Pedro mends. A month will see our power Flooding Castile; and as we rise in height, We drain the Guzmans dry. Another month, And I will force them to rebellious acts,â To open treason, and defiant arms. Another still, shall see them at my feet, Grovelling, and spurned! I hate her with a hate You cannot add to, nor abate, one jot. Your hate is honest, therefore harmless, lady; But mine is deadly, and would crawl and crawl, Through patient centuries, so that, at last, It might bound up and sting! There 's my whole heart; Make what you please of it. DoÃ±a M. You 'd rival me In my dear purpose? She is mine, I say, And I will have her! See you keep your hands From scorching, by this meddling in my fires! Sir, you presume to take upon yourself The part of principal, whom I designed Only as instrument. Could I suppose That there were one to share my hate with me, To take my vengeance from my rightful hands, Feel all my triumph,âby yon heavenly light, I 'd turn to loving Leonor, and stand A shield and falchion between her and harm! Alb. Are you quite sane? DoÃ±a M. I know not that I am; But this I know, I'm jealous in revenge, And I will overreach you. Look you, sir, If she must die, to glut an enmity, 'T is for my cause alone. Alb. Forgive my zeal. I thought my hatred to your life-long foe Would please you well. DoÃ±a M. It does not please. You raise A puny cause, and equal it with mine. Alb. 'T is very strange! DoÃ±a M. Hate with a heart like mine, And 't will be strange no longer. Alb. Hatred, then, Has jealousies like love. DoÃ±a M. Like everything That takes a sole possession of the heart. While you were working towards my private ends, I trusted youânay, urged you to the task; But, now, you rise and call the thing your own:â Hence, I abjure you! Alb. 'T is a curious light, Thrown on the morbid passions of the mad: For that the wearing process of her wrongs Has driven her mad, I see no way to doubt. [Aside.] Well, madam, take herâI concede to you All right and title in your Leonorâ Take her, God bless you, and be happy! DoÃ±a M. Ha! You 'd cozen me? I see it in your smirk. You think me crazy? I am sane, good sir,â Quite sane enough to counterplot your snares. I'll make you own, Lord Chancellor, ere long, That all the craft of statesmanship falls short, When its divided interests must contend With one lone passion of a woman's heart. Farewell! I ask no counsel, seek no aid: One of us twain shall have a laugh at this! [Exit.] Alb. She 's raving mad, I'll swear it on the mass! Another wild enthusiast to watchâ Another human thing to check and turn, And hold and loosen, and so overthrow. The Guzman 's mine!âWhy, I'm as mad as she! There 's something solid in her lunacy, Something that finds an echo in my heart. The Guzman 's mine, for all. Well, wellâ(Enter Coronel.) How now? Coronel. My lordâ Alb. Why, so was Lara yesterday. Cor. He 's dead. Alb. Thank God! Cor. Villena, too. Alb. More thanks! You see how Heaven is fighting for Castile! Cor. Their deaths were sudden. Alb. The less pain. Cor. Some sayâ Alb. I poisoned them? Cor. 'T is said. Alb. They wrong my office; Now I am minister, I use the axe. Your news is better than your scandal, sir: For it I'll make you the king's Cup-bearer: More such, and I'll divide my place with you. Cor. I'm not ambitious for a crown of thorns. Alb. (Starting.) Right! you are strangely right! The crown is mine, The glory mine,âperhaps, the shameful death. Right, Coronel!âYou heard? Cor. Nothing, my lord. Alb. 'T were wiser you did not. Thank Heaven, again, For all its bounties to our fair Castile! Cor. (Aside.) I mar these sweet devotions. Ha! ha! ha! [Laughing. That holy thought keeps wretched company. Alb. What said you, Coronel?âa crown of thorns? You are chief Cup-bearerâremember that. I must go watch the Guzmans. Farewell, sir. [Exit Coronel.] A crown of thorns!âRight, very right, indeed! [Exit slowly.] SCENE III. The Same. A large Hall in the Same. Leonor de Guzman and Enrique discovered. Enter an Attendant. Leonor. No tidings of my chaplain? Attendant. None, your grace. Enrique. To catch priests, mother, thou must fish with bait,â Fat livings, or fair maidensâ Leo. Shame! for shame! Thou takest old scandals for new truths, Enrique. It is too much the fashion of our age: But, son, remember, he who jests at things Held sacred by the body of mankind, Insults the dignity of man, and sets His flashy jokes above our grandest thoughts. En. I meant but little. Leo. Doubtless: yet thou 'dst claim A place in wisdom over all thy race,â Past, present, and to come. Go forth again, And push your search with busy secrecy. [Exit Attendant.] Perhaps the chaplain keeps away through fear. I 've spent a goodly time in argument, To overcome his scruples at the rites. Naught but the contract, with the royal seal, Will satisfy him: that I have mislaid. En. 'T is the first mention thou hast made of it: I have it, mother. Leo. Heaven be praised! where, where? En. Close, at my lodgings. Leo. Fly, and bring it here. How blind was I, not to have questioned thee! Time has slipped byâmost precious, precious timeâ While I consulted with myself.âO, fly! [Exit Enrique.] And so Enrique had it all the while! This comes from self-dependence. Over-trust In our own knowledge is an ignorance More perilous than modest diffidence, That doubts and asks, and from a child, perchance, May hear replies that daunt philosophers. I searched the world for that which lay at home, Formed secret plans to ferret out this deed, When a mere opening of my thought-pinched lips Was all I needed. We consume in thoughts That are the tattle of the market-place; And our best wisdom, after all our toil, Is but the world's, in rounded sentences. Who 'd thought EnriqueâWell, I'm wiser now; An open heart is a sage counsellor. Juana! (Enter Juana de Villena.) Juana. Madam! Leo. It has come, at last,â The wedding-day, I promised long ago. Jua. And every day since then. Leo. Thou 'rt peevish. Jua. No: 'T is the first pledge you ever left unfilled. Madam, I love you, and can pardon more Than that which lies not in your power to give. Yet if I doubt the baffled promise now, I blame this prison more than you, dear lady. Leo. (Kissing her.) Thou 'rt a sweet maiden! but we'll see, we'll see. This prisonâtrue, it has perplexed my will; Yet even those doors can never shut out hope. I keep the freshness of my mind untouched, Fill these close chambers with my smiles, and wake A ready music in the vaulted roofs With pardonable laughter. Dear Juana, Had they not prisoned me, I should have sunk Beneath Alfonso's death; but sufferings, That were disjointed from my deeper grief, Roused all my strength to beat them back again. I thank my enemies for this, at least. (ReÃ«nter Enrique.) Enrique. Here is the parchment. Leo. (Reading.) All in proper form. In to my heart, and nestle in its warmth! Once more, Juana, don thy wedding-clothes, And wait my call within. Enrique, thou Stand on a moment's warning to come forth. En. We have observed this form for many a day; Yet, as it pleases, we will play it o'er. Leo. To-day my heart is whispering success. (Enter Attendant.) Attendant. Your chaplain, madam. [Exit.] Leo. Ha! In, in, my loves! The sun is shining on your brightest day! (Exeunt Enrique and Juana. Enter the Chaplain.) Do not prepare thyself with shrugs, and frowns, And signals of distress. Good father, look, Here is the deed! 'T is signed by King Alfonso, Witnessed by all the ministers, and sealed With the armorial castles of the realm. Thou doubt'st? Hast thou betrayed me? Chaplain. Daughter, no: Yet there are fears, not only for the Church, But thee, who'll be the chiefest sufferer By this concealed affair. Leo. Think not of me. If by this deed I made a sacrifice Of the few days which Heaven designs for me, Think'st thou not, father, I would through with it, Though every step were nearer to the grave? Chap. Indeed, I fearâ Leo. Fears are no guests of mine. Chap. Yet for thyself. Leo. My children are myself: I have no care beyond my family. I know the weight and moment of this deed; It may exalt Enrique to a crownâ Ay, even to a crown: and as for me, Father, it can but kill; and if I feel No fear of death, his common sting is gone. Chap. I will consent. Leo. O, bless thee!âHark! I hear A cat-like foot-fall in the corridor. [Drops on her knees.] Father, I do confess, I have much wronged, (Enter Alburquerque.) In spirit, that good man, Lord Alburquerque. I do confessâ Alburquerque. What farce is this? Leo. My lord, You see me at confession. Pardon me; My sins are heavy. Alb. I can witness that. Leo. Your evidence will never reach the court I shall be tried by. In a moment, sir, I'll be at leisure. Alb. Here 's some villany! I'll try her, though. [Aside and exit, dropping his handkerchief.] Chap. Daughter, arise! he 's gone. Leo. A moment, father,âbear with me a while. I do confess, I 've had suspicious thoughts Of good Lord Alburquerqueâ (ReÃ«nter Alburquerque suddenly.) Ah! I knew it! [Aside.] Alb. I dropped myâ [Looks around.] Leo. Wits, my lord? Alb. Hum! Still on her knees: A pious sight! (Aside.) My precious handkerchief: A love-gift, madam. [Picks it up, and abstractedly begins tearing it.] Leo. And you treat it thus! Alb. 'Fore Heaven! you 'd best not mock me! [Going.] Leo. Mock you, sir? Do I offend?âNay, stay, my lord. Have you, Or any of the courtiers, seen my son? Pray send Enrique to me. Alb. (Aside.) So it seems I have outrun suspicion. Should I see The CondÃ©, madam, I will be your page. Something is wrong here. Could I trust my nose, I 'd say that I smelt treachery in the air. I'll not neglect you long,âbe sure of that. [Aside and exit.] Leo. (Springing up.) Now, father, haste! Juana and Enrique, Come forth! My promise is well-nigh fulfilled. (ReÃ«nter Juana and Enrique.) On, to the chapel! Chap. For thy sake alone, I made my opposition. Leo. Say no more, But get about thy duties. I'll stand guard. Gather my household, as you go along, And take them in as witnesses. No words; Words are the clogs of action. [Exeunt all but Leonor.] Ha, ha, ha! [Laughing.] Good Alburquerque, if you knew of this! O, gracious Heaven, what if they murder me! Why, let them strike! I 've done a deed to-day, With which Castile shall ring for years to come. What is my life to my Enrique's love, And blessed tears upon my memory? Already, in my fancy, I can see A shadowy crown that binds his regal brows, And deepens, slowly, till its form becomes Substantial matter, blazing with great gems, And all the royal symbols of Castile!â (ReÃ«nter Alburquerque.) Ha! vulture! Alburquerque. Fresh from the confessional, You re-begin your naughtiness. Alas! Continued penitence must pre-suppose Continued sin. I fear such penitence Is Satan's stale temptation to new guilt. Ward, I must keep your soul in stricter charge. Leo. A man may enter the infernal gates With proverbs on his lips. You are a bee That hives its honey for another's use. My lord, is Don Enrique found? Alb. He 's here. Leo. Indeed? I see him not. [Laughing.] Alb. O, fie! my lady, Is childish trifling the best wit you bring, To meet at our joined issue? For my part, Being no ready jester with my tongue, I put my jokes in writing. Look you, now, [Shows a paper.] Here is the substance of my thoughts,âthe warrant, Signed by Don Pedro, which I promised you. Leo. (Reading.) Did the king sign this? And must Juana be withdrawn from me? You use me harshly. Must she go to-day? Alb. Upon the instant. For Don Pedro thinks Such wide possessions as Juana holds Are dangerous wardships in a subject's hands. A treacherous guardian might employ her wealth For private objects, without fear of loss,â In treasons, plots.âI see you understand. Leo. The king thinks thus? Alb. And, therefore, has resolved. Leo. A wise young king!âboth wise and resolute! They say his wisdom 's at his elbow ever, Not in his brain, where common wit abides. Alb. Where is Juana? Leo. At her prayers, my lord. Alb. This is a prayerful house. Leo. I'll summon her. Alb. Yes, and at once. For since her brother's deathâ Leo. Her brother's death! Poor soul! she knows it not. How fell it, sir? Alb. Through lack of life, they say. Bring her, and you shall hear. Leo. MiguÃ©l! (Enter an Attendant.) Alb. I'll go. [Going.] Leo. (Preventing him.) Nay, nay, my lord, you'll keep me company. MiguÃ©l, you'll find my ward, engaged in prayer, Within the chapel. After she has doneâ You understand me?âafter she has done, His lordship fain would greet her. As you go, Close all the doors, and make their fastenings tight. [Aside to him.] (Exit Attendant, closing the doors.) So much I hold the church's offices In my respectâ [Noise without.] Alb. (Starting.) I heard a bolt shoot. Leo. âThat, Taking the libertyâ Alb. You talk for time: Your face betrays you. Cope with me, forsooth! There 's some vile plot afoot within this house! The air is black with it!âHo! there, my guard! (Enter Soldiers.) Search the Alcazar! Leo. (Aside.) Now, they're at the rites! Maritum juxta ritum sanctÃ¦.âNow, Juana answers, Volo!âNow, the ring Is blessed, is sliding on her fingerâI Was married once.âOremus, says the priest: And now, the benediction!âHold, my lord!â [Aloud.] Per Christum DominumâAmen! I cry,â Ha! ha! my lord, you are an age too late! [Laughing.] Alb. Are all the women in the kingdom mad? Ha! madam, are your glances all that way?â In, to the chapel! Guard. (Trying the door.) It is barred, my lord. Alb. I did not ask you if the door were barred, I ordered you to pass it. Find a way, [Drawing.] Or, by the saints, I'll drive you through it!âOn! [Soldiers attempt to force the door.] Leo. Stand, thou firm oak! Alb. It yields! Let me assist. Leo. (Holding him.) My lord, you shall not!ânay, beseech you, sir!â There 's naught within. Alb. (Struggling with her.) Thou liest! Unhand me, fool! I would not do thee violence.âOff! off! [Flings her off.] (A burst of organ-music is heard.) Leo. 'T is done! 't is done! Now tear the prison down, And make its ruins monuments for me! (Organ-music. The door gives way. The Chaplain, followed by Enrique, Juana, and a bridal-train, are discovered within the doorway, and slowly enter.) Alb. What means this mummery? Leo. A marriage masqueâ No more, my lordâa masque, a merry sham. You 're welcome to our bridal! Alb. Are they wed? Chaplain. They are, my lord. Alb. Sir priest, your shaven crown Shall ache for this! Chap. (Offering the parchment.) Here 's my commission: Read. Alb. Curse thee and thy commission! Some oneâGuard, Drag down that sorceress to a dungeon! Wretch, I'll make you wish this wedding-day of yours Were blotted from the calendar! Leo. And Iâ I kept my promise, Alburquerque. Mark, I have outdone you in your own bad trade! O, Heaven!âI cannot reach thee, dear Juana; [Staggers towards her.] But bless thee, daughter! I am sick with joy. My lord, pray kiss the bride for meâO! O! [Faints] ACT V. SCENE I. A Street in Talavera. The houses hung with banners, garlands, etc. The street spanned by triumphal arches, and strewn with flowers. Music, bells, shouts, etc., are heard. Enter a crowd of Citizens. First Citizen. Has the procession passed? Second Citizen. Not yet. Third Citizen. Keep back! Your bushy-head is stuck before my eyes: I would not see the progress in your hair. Fourth Citizen. You 're coarse. Third C. But honest. First C. Have you seen the king? Second C. Often. First C. What looks he like? Second C. A well-grown boy: He favors your cub, Pablo. First C. So, indeed? Second C. Ay, he 's but human; has your aches and ails,â Sweats when he 's hot, and shivers when he 's cold,â Eats when he 's hungry, drinks when he is dry,â Will die, sans question, if he catch the plague, And go to dust the same as any here. First C. That 's odd! He wears a crown? Second C. Not always, friend; 'T would make his own crown ache. First C. You 're passing dry. Citizens. (Within.) Long live King Pedro! All. Ho! long live the king! (Ladies throw garlands and flowers from the balconies and windows. Music, ringing of bells, etc. Enter, in triumphal procession, Noblemen, Knights, Gentlemen, Priests, Pages, Soldiers, etc., with banners, arms, crosses, etc.; then, Coronel, bearing a great cup.) First C. Who 's that? Second C. Alonso Coronel, by trade A traitor: he shifts his lieges with his coats. First C. He 's the king's poisoner; for, see his cup. Second C. That is a private office. (Shouts. As Coronel and the rest pass off, enter the Grand Standard-bearer, the Lieutenant-general of Castile, the Lord High Chamberlain, the Captain of the Guard, and others of the royal household, in their robes, and bearing the insignia of their offices.) First C. Look, look, sir! There goes the king, carrying his golden crown Upon a cushion, for his better ease. Second C. The saints forgive! That is the Lord Lieutenant. First C. He must be honest, to be trusted thus. Now, never tell me that's not the king's headsman; I see the sword. How grim the villain looks! Second C. Why, neighbor, he is the Lord Chamberlain. First C. Is that the king's sword? Second C. Ay. First C. Were I the king, I d keep my sword and jewels to myself; For fear they 'd knock my brains out with the one, To steal the other. (Enter Don Pedro, Alburquerque, DoÃ±a Maria, Ladies, &amp;c.) Who is he that smiles?â The ugly fellow with the seals and key?â The king's clerk, ha? Second C. The greatest Don in Spain, Lord Chancellor, and Treasurer of the realm, Juan de Alburquerque. First C. By the saints! I'll keep my body from his clutches. Lord! Had ever man such wicked eyes as his! Third C. And brains to back them. [Alburquerque smiles and bows to the people.] All. Ho! King Pedro! ho! [Don Pedro bows.] First C. What little boy is that who bows his head? Second C. That is the king. First C. The Lord forgive me, friend! I took him for the seal-and-key man's knave, Aping his master. Third C. You might shoot more wide. All. Hush! hush! First C. The king would speak. Third C. The king, indeed! Wait till the Chancellor has cleared his throat. (Shouts. Alburquerque ascends a stand, smiling and bowing.) Alburquerque. Loyal Castilians, in the king's behalf, I thank your noble spirits for this cheer. His grace has pleased to make me orator, More from affection than my own deserts; And if my speech sound roughly in your ears, Blame not the king, but say the instrument Fits not his purpose. First C. That is sweet enough. Third C. Soft as the velvet on a tiger's paw. Alb. I do not pause for want of matter, friends, But from a flood of it. 'T were tedious, Even in your faithful hearing, to recount The many glories of King Pedro's reign. You who affect your countryâas I trust All do, within the compass of my voiceâ Can call to mind the doleful days she passed Ere the young king was firmly in his seat. Which one of you could leave his cottage-door, With full assurance of a safe return? Whose wife was sacred? Whose fair daughter kept Her chastity inviolate? Or who Had heart to lay up wealth, or gather flocks, Or plant a vineyard, or plough up a field, Or do the lightest labor, that reposed Upon the future for its just reward? And why? Because the land was faction's prey. Because the cottage looked askance, in dread, Upon the neighboring castle. Because lawâ That equal arbiter 'twixt high and lowâ Was but a word. Because your pleasant fields Were trodden by the bloody foot of war. Because your wives were ravished 'neath your eyes, By shameless ruffians, and your daughters led Into a servitude more infamous Than old Egyptian bondage.âAy, and you Were scoffed, insulted, scourged,ânay, slain outright,â If your poor tongues arose in mutiny Against your savage masters. Scarce a year, And all these horrors were familiar things. O, what a changeâO, what a blessed changeâ Has fallen upon Castile! I 've tamedâI mean, The king has tamed his lords, destroyed their dens, Scattered their servile troops, avenged your wrongs; And turned his nobles to a better use Than plundering, torturing, and murdering you. Can you ask more, who have security For house and household, faith in property, Equal and proper justice unto all, And the mild triumphs of a settled peace? All. No, no! Long live King Pedro! Alb. It assures His royal mind, to hear you answer thus, And ratifies his future policy. There may be some who murmur at the king, Even while his gentle goodness shelters them: To them I say, that perfect government Is not the offspring of a single day; But, like the greater creatures of the earth, Is rounded slowly in the womb of time, And brought to light with more extended pains Than the less bulky matters of the world. Once more, I thank you for his majesty; Who, when he 's hence, would ask your memories To hold no thoughts of him that are not warmed By the dear currents of your grateful hearts. Therefore, his grace has ordered me to give A royal largess to the suffering poor; Found a new chapel in Saint Pedro's name; Rebuild your bridges, open up your roads, And make your fountains spout with wine to-day. All. Long live King Pedro!âGod protect the king! [Exeunt Don Pedro and Alburquerque, bowing, DoÃ±a Maria, and the others.] First C. 'T was a grand speech! Third C. You understood it, then? First C. O, yes; about the womb of government Producing monsters, and the like. But, then, The largess was the thing! Third C. He but returns A piece of what the taxes wrung from us: He 's liberal in our pockets. First C. Friends, come on! There'll be more speeches, and more largess, too. What a sweet gentleman the Treasurer is! [Exeunt.] SCENE II. The Same. A Dungeon in the Castle. The music of Don Pedro's progress, the shouts of the people, &amp;c., are occasionally heard without. Enter Leonor de Guzman. Leonor. Shout on, good people!âring, ye merry bells!â Ye jocund instruments of harmony, Breathe your glad music to the breathless heavens! That he who sitteth in eternal joy, Amid angelic minstrelsy, may smile To see his happy children mimic him! I am glad the world rejoices; for poor I, Who sit amid the embers of my life, Turning its dying fancies o'er and o'er, Had almost lost my faith in happiness. My sorrows cast a shadow either way, Darkening the past, and glooming towards the future.â This is not just. Misfortunes I have known, Cares, troubles, dangers; yet some touch of light Has gilt the summits of my drearest fate, Just as the hour seemed darkest. I have known Long days of rapture, nights of sweet content, Lit by prophetic dreams of coming cheer, And memories of forgotten happiness. I have no right to murmur. Born to naught, I lived a queen; unwedded, I was loved; Loved, I brought forth a numerous progeny; And they, though base-born, only less than kings. My deeds have given my country history; My virtues live in many a grateful heart That knew their bounty; and my fate shall draw The drooping eyelid o'er full many a tear That falls upon the silence of the past:â I am immortal in man's memory. [Shouts, music, &amp;c.] Therefore, rejoice, good people of Castile, And give dumb instruments a voice of joy! You share a cheerfulness which once was mine. (Enter Juana and the Chaplain.) Juana. Joy, mother, joy!âYet this is cruel in me, To bring my merriment to your abode. Forgive my folly! Leo. Joy, Juana, joy! Shall I who love thee, to the point of pain, Not make my dwelling echo with thy joy? See, I can laugh, and sing, and play the fool, As well as any in the sunny fields! [Laughs and sings.] False lover, if thou 'lt not love me, Then, sure, I'll be another's; For, ha! ha! ha! the world is wide, And man has many brothers. For, ha! ha! ha! the fields are green, When love shines bright above me; But other fields may seem as green, When other hearts may love me. If thou wilt not divide thy joy with me, Why, then, I'll weep, indeed. Jua. EnriqueâO, Mere rapture makes me stumble in my speechâ Enrique has escaped, and sheltered him In the Asturias. Leo. Now, be praise to Heaven! A while ago, I almost did repine, Because these walls were dark, and yon small grate Was chary of the sunlight, and the drops Of chilling water, from these sweating vaults, Seemed to be falling on my lonely heart. But, now, the walls are windows, and the grate Glows, as if burning in the central sun, And every drop falls from the blue above, Like rich celestial dew. (Shouts, &amp;c., without.) Ay, shout again, Shout, ye blind multitudes! for I desire A nation's voice to tell my gratitude! I knew the springs of mercy were not dry, I knew God's hand sowed blessings through the world, I knew this dungeon hid me not from him, And yet I dared repine! Chaplain. Daughter, thy words Are fervent with the essence of true grace. Hast thou repented of the sinful tie That bound thee to Alfonso? Leo. Father, no; Frankly, I tell thee, it is there my heart Fights with thy holy teachings. I repent The wrong our union did the hapless queen, The public scandal of a life like ours, The charter which we gave to those who sought Excuses in example; but the tieâ The pure connection of two faithful hearts, Through the mysterious avenues of loveâ Seems something holier, something nearer heaven, Than aught the Church has gathered from above. There is no creed for this, no law, I own, Save that which nature whispers in our ears; And, in her whisper, pardon if I thought I heard the still small voice. Chap. Ah! daughter, daughter, This mars thy faith, and makes it incomplete. Thy stubborn clinging to one darling sin Will lose thee heaven. Leo. Heaven judge me! I have judged According to the light within my soul. If there was better light, as thou dost urge, It never shone for me.âNo more of this. Chap. Thou 'st never felt the guilt of thy misdeed? Leo. Never, so help me Heaven! Now, if thou wilt, Heal o'er the other wounds within my soul; But leave this bare to God's anointing eye. My task on earth is finished. Father, come, And get me ready for a higher life. [Exeunt.] SCENE III. The Same. A State Apartment in the same. Don Pedro, DoÃ±a Maria, and Alburquerque discovered. Don Pedro. Now that our rule is settled in Castile, And we the darlings of the people's hearts, Were it not well, amid our happiness, To cast an eye on mercy, and declare A general amnesty? Alburquerque. Methinks, your grace Has simply turned the matter upside down. For, by your favor, as your arm is strong, And able to bear out your royal will, Now is the time most fit for punishment. Now weed the kingdom of your enemies, By their decay enriching your tried friends; And if the vassals murmur for their lords, Give them grand bull-fights, at the dead lords' cost. Thus says my almanac. Don P. My lord, you 're wise; And to your hands we trust our government, With good assurance of prosperity. Yet, surely, there are some, now prisonersâ For I have heard our castles groan with themâ Whose liberation would not harm the state. 'T was but to-day Fadrique pressed a suit To free his mother, DoÃ±a Leonor. And so far as my unripe wit may go, I see no reasonâ Alb. But I see a thousand Why you should chop her head off! DoÃ±a Maria. (Laughing.) Pardon me: Was it because she over-reached your skill In Don Enrique's marriage? Alb. That will do,â Out of a thousand reasons, that 's enough. I freely own, she circumvented me. DoÃ±a M. Which only provesâ[Pauses.] Alb. Well, what? DoÃ±a M. That you were gulled Less by her skill than by your want of it. Alb. Show me so deep a woman.â DoÃ±a M. (Aside to him.) Here, sir. [Curtseys.] Alb. Pish! Your highness should do one of these two things Either put DoÃ±a Leonor to death, Or make her your prime minister. Don P. (Laughing.) You jest. Alb. The saints forbid! for, ere the year be up Castile will be alone with one of us. In soberness, I would advise your grace To give me warrant for that woman's death. I'll execute it in a private way, With little noiseâ DoÃ±a M. And little pain to her. How feeling in your lordship! what a care To make death comfortable! Please, your grace, I, as a woman, cry against an act That would disgrace the honor of your sex; One whose sole motive and excuse would be Your victim's weakness. Don P. You forget your wrongs. DoÃ±a M. Ay, in the presence of so foul a wish, I blush to know my thoughts were kindred once. Time and her sufferings have so moved my heart, That I would greet her with a sister's kiss, Rather than render her to that bad man, Who 'd stain your ermine for a private pique. Don P. Mother, this mercy showsâ Alb. Ay, shows, your graceâ Nothing but showsâyou hit the very word! Her mercy is not real, 't is counterfeit, It has to me a hollow-hearted sound; And yet she 'd palm itâ Don P. Recollect yourself! Your spleen breaks in upon your sovereign's speech, To vilify his mother. Have a care, Or even you may carry it too far. Must I deny the virtue I behold, To trust the secret guilt your words betray? You cover your revenge in robes of state, And ask my voice to sanction the vile hag; While naked mercy must be shuffled by, To give your harlot room. Beware, my lord, Lest these instructions in cruel policy Be not too well remembered,âlest the spring Of impious knowledge, opened in my mind, Some day, o'erwhelm the opener! Alb. 'T was my haste: Yet I can show the motivesâSire, you frownâ You frown upon your faithful counsellor! You frown upon the pilot whose true eye Guided your early voyage past many a rock, Unknown to you, who laughed from the high deck; Through many a storm, whose raging waters strove To tear his hand from the unsteady helm, While you slept lightly in your dangerous berth! Ay, sire, through treacherous calms, and furious storms, Scorched by hot suns, or blind with hissing spray, Weary with watching, sick with over-toil,â I bore you safely. This is my reward! Ah! you do well, to push the knave asideâ The rough, blunt fellow whom you loved at seaâ Now you are riding, with your anchors down, And all your streamers fanning the mild airs, Safe in the harbor which he brought you to. Don P. My lordâ Alb. Still frowning! Well, discharge me, then; You may find better statesmen in the streets; The earth must teem with them; or you, my liege, Would be more careful in preserving me. 'T is not the minister whose heart is wrung, By this decline from early confidence, It is the man! [Affects to weep.] DoÃ±a M. (Aside to him.) O! let me see that tearâ That natural wonderâO! beseech you, sir! [Laughing.] Alb. Marplot, begone! [Aside to her.] Don P. Dear Alburquerque, nayâ Alb. Here I lay down the seals and golden key, That marked my office of abundant trust, Here, at Don Pedro's feet; and may the hand That lifts them thence be worthier of their charge, By skill and grace, if not by honesty. [Lays down the seals and key.] Lie thereâuntil I pick ye up again. [Aside and exit.] Don P. My lord! DoÃ±a M. He 's gone. Alas! dear gentleman, He was sincere, no doubt, in his intent; But Leonor, poor creature, must not die: She is the mother of thy father's sons. Thou 'lt free her soon? Don P. Not yet. DoÃ±a M. Thou 'lt give her hope? Don P. Yes, if the Chancellor consent. DoÃ±a M. But, Pedro, Thou art the king, and can do anything. Don P. I 'm not so sure of that. Too well I know, I cannot govern this Castile of mine, Without Lord Alburquerque. Mother, send, Send to his palace, bid him come to me; And say, his seals are lying at my feet, Awaiting his return. DoÃ±a M. I'll go myself, In secrecy and silence. 'T were not well To have this business noised abroad. True, true, We cannot do without the Chancellor. Farewell!âPray, trust thy signet-ring to me, And let me bear a little ray of hope To Leonor. 'T is an odd fancy, ha? Yet words of hope and comfort, from my mouth, Would move her strangely. [Drawing the ring from his finger.] Don P. 'T is as well, perhaps, To grant her wish; for Leonor must die. [Aside.] Thou must not leave ere you are reconciled. Forgive some rudeness from her natural pride, And say I pity her. But, then, the state, Or Alburquerque, or whate'er it is, Will murder her! (Aside.) Well, take my signet-ringâ The Chancellor would rage to see it goâ [Aside.] Would it were always used in such fair deeds! Juana keeps with herâshe owes me that; I gave Fadrique leave to see her, too; Another kindness which she'll thank me for. But, then, the stateâO! motherâ [Walks up the stage.] DoÃ±a M. Farewell, son! (As she is going, reÃ«nter Alburquerque, with a bundle of papers. He regards her fixedlyâshe returns his look.) Alburquerque. Well, what now? DoÃ±a M. Nothing, my good lord. Alb. Hum! hum! Nothing, indeed? You have a conquering look. DoÃ±a M. I have been pleading with the king for you. Forâhark you, sirâI have resolved to drop My hate to Leonor within your hands. I am but weak, and see I must abide Your lordship's pleasure; play a second part, And leave the stage to you. But swear to me Not to give up your purpose till the king Sign her death-warrant. This, at least, I'll have. Alb. You shall. But I will have the Guzman, hey? That, too, I purposed. Ha! ha! ha! she 's mine! [Laughing.] DoÃ±a M. You are not generous. Alb. (Laughing.) Ha! ha! why, no: I like a triumph. DoÃ±a M. Pray, address the king: He 's ripe to welcome you. Alb. (Laughing.) Ha! ha! 't was rare! A woman rival me! [Turns towards Don Pedro.] DoÃ±a M. (Aside.) And conquer you! Now for my swoop of vengeance! (As Alburquerque slowly approaches Don Pedro, DoÃ±a Maria steals off.) Don P. Welcome! Nay, Do not hold off, but take your seals again. Alb. My liege, you misconceive me. I have brought The papers, of most pressing consequence, Which lay beneath the judgment of my eye. The man who holds my place as minister Will get some headaches over these, I trow! They are of urgent momentâthough I have A wain-load waiting at the palace-gateâ And so I brought them first. For, notice, sire, [Going over the papers rapidly.] This is a plan for rating the poll-tax. This is a paper on the custom-dues Established by Navarre. This, from Biscay, Begging their English league may be confirmed. Here 's a petition from the clergymenâ Long articles, in number twenty-oneâ A most involved and cunning document. Here 's one on criminal procedure; this Needs instant reformation. Here, the salt-pits,â A question to be managed dexterously. Hum!âwoolâwineâtaxesâtaxesâtaxes.âThis Is the projected treaty with Navarre. Ah! here is businessâhere is food for thought! For, sire, I hold that Aragonâ Don P. Good heavens! I nothing know of this! Alb. Let me explain. The Cortes that will meetâ Don P. Forbear, forbear! On your allegiance, I command you, hold! You drive me frantic with the catalogue; Spare me the explanation. Take your seals, And end these matters in your own good way. Alb. Forgive me, sire. Don P. You do not love me. Alb. Yes, Most dearly, sire; but Leonor, my foe, Has got between me and your confidence. Don P. In Heaven's name, take her, and perform your will; But, pray, take up your seals and treasury-key! Alb. (Running over the papers.) Ay, here 's the warrant. Sign, your grace. [Puts a pen in his hand.] Don P. (Writing.) 'T is done. Alb. And I resume my seals and key. (Picks them up.) My liege, Lend me your signet: 't is a private warrant. Don P. I have it not. Alb. Indeed? I cautioned you Never to part with it, except to me. Who has it, sire? Don P. My mother. Alb. Horrible! The devil 's rampant in Castile, I think! That ring bears absolute command with it. O! sire, you sealed the fate of DoÃ±a Leonor An hour before you thought. [Going.] Don P. Stay, Chancellor! Where are you going? Alb. To the Guzman's cell. Heaven grant I be in time! Don P. For what, my lord? Alb. To stay your mother's hand, before it reeks With Leonor de Guzman's blood. Don P. O! O!â O! terrible conjecture! Dare not thinkâ Alb. Abide the issue, and you'll think with me. The subtle monster! how she smiled and bowed, And begged revenge from me, and stole away, With the damned purpose packing her hot heart Until it almost burst! O! women, women! Turn you to devils, and the ancient fiends Shall stand aghast with horror! 'Sdeath! I dream, I dream, while she 's at work. (Aside.) Farewell, your grace! The woman has cajoled me, as I live! [Aside and exit.] Don P. I'll not believe it, till the frightful deed Make her as odious as the thought of it. Never! 't is monstrous! And the Chancellor Outdoes suspicion in suspecting it. [Exit.] SCENE IV. The Same. A Dungeon in the Same. Leonor de Guzman discovered. Leonor. I cannot master them: these gloomy thoughts Crowd and bewilder reason. If a voice Had cried from heaven, Thy latest hour has come, I could not more believe it. Can the soul Warn its dear body of their sad divorce, Ere death confront them? Or am I the fool Of dreadful fancies, nourished in the dark Of this detested prison? Bounteous Heaven, If yonder sun, that, like a traveller, Pauses upon the boundaries of his land, To take a survey of the things he loves, Shall ne'er return to me,âgrant one last boon! That I may calmly lapse into thy arms, With time to think of thy beneficence; And not be hurried to the judgment-seat, By thy grim officer, appalling Death, Crying against the justice of my doom. I fear thee not, O Death! The grave, the worm, The noisome process of a slow decay, Were naught to me, if being ended there, And peace closed up the dying lids for aye. But, O! the terrors that a sinful soul, Bursting its slumber at the Archangel's trump, Must feel when it remembers its last act, Ere it lay down to sleep, was guilty fear, That tugged and wrestled with its Maker's will! O watchful Heaven, if my poor destiny Have o'er engaged the service of thy thoughts, Grant me my prayer! And, as my latter days Are full of frowns and dreadful threatenings, Smile at the last, and round my closing hours With all the bounties thou 'st withheld so long! I do not murmur, Lord,âI do not ask, While all are taken, I alone should stay; I would but choose my way of going hence, Not as a voyager, as a suppliant. (Enter Juana and Fadrique.) Fadrique. Mother! [Embraces her.] Leo. My son! Sure Heaven has re-begun Its broken blessings. But how cam'st thou here? Where is Enrique?âhast thou heard from him? They tell me he has fled to Portugal. And Tello, too?âand all the little ones Who call me mother? Stay, Fadrique, stay! Answer no questions till I look at thee. How thou hast grown!âJuana, has he not?â An inch or more. Much like thy father, too: His breadth of shoulder, and his girth of chest, And the fixed eye that looked through coming years, So like a prophet's. Now, the news, the news! Thou seest they keep me from it in this cell. Here time is stagnant; the vast tides of life Flow by yon loop-hole, yet no ripple comes To break the calm in which I idly sleep. I am a foolish woman, for I think That I am weeping. [Weeps.] Fad. Mother, do not grieve! Enrique, and my brothers, are quite safe; And, as for me, I blush to recollect How kind thy enemies have been to me. Be of good cheer: I saw the king to-day, And found his spirit was inclined to be Most kindly towards thee. He, by special grace, Sends me, as earnest for his good intents. Juana. Your hard imprisonment is well-nigh o'er. Leo. I know it, dear Juana. Days agoâ But more to-day than any former timeâ I had undoubted notice. Jua. That is strange! And yet you told me not. Leo. I could not then. The words seemed doubtful. They are plainer now,â Plainer and plainer, as the moments fly. Fad. What mean'st thou, mother? Leo. This: if one should sayâ One of the playmates of my childhoodâWhy, Why do my thoughts run backward to their source, Keeping my childhood ever in my sight? Fad. I really know not. Thou began'st to say?â Leo. O, yes. If one should ask me, âLeonor, Where wilt thou be to-morrow?â I 'd reply, In heaven, beloved; and feel I spoke strict truth. Fad. Confinement has unstrung thy mind. Alas! Who put these dreary notions in thy head? Leo. Why, so I ask; and shake my heavy brain, And look around for comfort. Naught replies; And once again my lonely spirit sinks Beneath the pressure of a dismal doom. Fad. 'T is the dark hour before the morning breaks. Leo. Ay, and the morning breaks in heaven. (DoÃ±a Maria appears at the door, looks in, and retires.) My son, Dost thou believe the spirit can detect The presence of things hurtful? For, just now, I felt as if the shadow of death's wing Passed over me, and chilled me to the soul. [Shudders.] Fad. Dear mother, hearâ (Enter an Attendant.) Attendant. My lord, the king desires Your instant presence. Fad. But a moment more. Att. My orders bade you speed. Leo. Kings never wait. Go, my Fadrique; it may mar you else. Fad. Let it; I care not. Leo. But I do, my son. I may behold thee, though thou seest not me, Looking adown the sunny depth of heaven Upon this troubled earth. A last farewell! And tell Enrique, when he' s kingâ Fad. He 's king! Leo. I had it in a vision, and 't will be. Fad. Thou art the plaything of thy fantasy. Farewell!âYet stay a moment.â DoÃ±a Maria. (Without.) Don Fadrique! Fad. 'T is the king's voice. Leo. Or one that mimics it: Yet go.âThat voice was terrible to me. [Aside.] Fad. Farewell! until we meet. Leo. In heaven. [Embraces him.] Fad. Farewell! [Exit.] Leo. I 've looked my last upon him! Gentle Heaven, Withhold the blow no longer!âStrike, at once, Before my coward fancies make me rave! Jua. Dear mother, thou art ill. (Enter DoÃ±a Maria, masked and cloaked, with Attendants, also disguised.) Leo. My prayer is answered. Jua. Who are these masks? DoÃ±a Maria. Leonor de Guzman, hark! Leo. Maria de Portugal, I listen. DoÃ±a M. Ha! Thou know'st me, then? Leo. I pray you, drop your mask; It frightens me, yet does not hide your face. DoÃ±a M. Behold my face, and let it drive thee mad! [Unmasking.] Seest thou these furrows on my youthful brow, This net-work web of scars and crooked lines? Seest thou these grizzled locksâthese withered hands, Pinched by the grip of miseryâthis low stoop, That bears the burden of a thousand caresâ These tear-scorched eyesâthis breast, a home for sighs And quivering inspirations?âDost thou know The heart within, the lonely heart, that aches At each pulsation? This is all thy work, And thou shouldst know it! Leo. Had you loved the kingâ DoÃ±a M. Hadst thou not lied, as thou art lying now, He might have loved me. Love him! Did I not? With passions to have burst thy puny heart, Hadst thou but felt them. If they turned to gall, And poisoned heart and brain, who was to blameâ I, or thou, wanton? Men have called thee fair, Blaspheming sense, by saying thou wert born To prove how plain the touch of heaven might show In earthly clay; and they have said thy form Was a poor casket for thy richer mind: Now, in thy wisdom, why have I come here? Leo. Perhaps, to slay me. DoÃ±a M. Thou hast hit the mark With thy first shaft. Jua. (Kneeling to DoÃ±a Maria.) O, madamâplease your grace!â DoÃ±a M. Back, bastard's drudge! Prepare to die. Leo. I have: My life has been one act of preparation. DoÃ±a M. Thou sweet-faced hypocriteâthou who hast been The minion of man's passionsâthou prepare, By such a life, to brazen heavenly wrath! What dost thou fancy heaven? Leo. A blessed place, Where the sincerely penitent may dwell, Quite purified through mercy. DoÃ±a M. Purified! Hast thou repented? Leo. You have given me time, Here, in my prison, through the long, long nights, To be alone with Heaven. I thank you, madam; For, through your darkest clouds, grace dawned on me. DoÃ±a M. Fool that I was! Feel'st thou secure of grace? Leo. As far as mortal may. DoÃ±a M. Dost thou repent Thy wrongs to me? Leo. I do, sincerely, madam, With all the mischief my example did, And pray your pardon heartily. [Kneels.] DoÃ±a M. Thou dost? I 'd add new fuel to the flames of woe, Ere I 'd do this for thee. Dost thou repent Thy sorceries,âthe devilish arts employed On me and Pedro, to o'ercome our lives, While we lay, weakly, in one painful bed? Leo. I never practised them. DoÃ±a M. 'T is false! Leo. Indeed, I ne'er had cause to pray to Heaven for that. DoÃ±a M. Dost thou repent the shameless life thou 'st led With King Alfonso,âthe bold, guilty love? Leo. The life, perhaps, I do regret; the love Never, O never! DoÃ±a M. (Laughing.) Ha! there 's still one spotâ There 's still one damned spot upon thy soulâ Which the infernal flames shall kindle to! [Seizes her.] Jua. O murder!âmurder!â DoÃ±a M. Stop that screech-owl's breath! [Attendants seize Juana.] Leo. Spare meâbe mercifulâO let me go! [Struggling with her.] I am a womanânot a heroineâ One of thy sex! I would not use thee thus! Jua. Help!âmurder!âmurder!âHark! [Noise without.] Leo. O, pardon me! I loved Alfonsoâthat is my excuse! DoÃ±a M. And that my retribution! [Stabs her.] Leo. It is well! God's purpose, and I bow to it. [Falls.] (Juana rushes forward and raises her.) Alburquerque. (Without.) Stand by! Sentinel. (Without.) The queen commandedâ Alb. (Without.) Curse the queen's command! (Hurls the Sentinel through the door, and enters, followed by armed Attendants.) Ho! Leonor de Guzman; wake, look up! I 've brought anotherâsurer than the firstâ Another warrantâtry to gull me nowâ Strangle that woman! [His Attendants advance towards Leonor.] DoÃ±a M. (Interposing.) Murderers, back! or I Will strike you with my poniard! Alb. Murderers, hey? By what new title have you dubbed yourself? DoÃ±a M. Avenger, and not murderer. No, my lord, You shall not harm a single hair of her. She 's all my own, by virtue of my wrongs. Alb. And mine, by virtue of my rights. Jua. Peace, peace! A little quiet for a parting soul! Leo. Let the wolves rage, according to their kind. I am content with Heaven's decree. If fate Were in our hands, we 'd make but sorry work. O, hapless queen! the tears you'll shed for this Cannot be numbered by a count of years. Forlorn, heart-broken, lonely, cast aside By him, your son, the only soul you love, You shall drag on a train of painful days, Darker and longer than the arctic nights. Despised by all, pitied by none, you'll die A death as sudden as my own! Alb. And I?â Now, while the gift of prophecy is strong, A word for me; for I deserve your care;â My fate? Leo. Dead, in Enrique's cause; and thenâ Alb. The sky will fall, and we'll catch larks!âAmen! Leo. Scoffer, your jeers fall blunted on my ear; The shield of death is spread above my head, And mocks are useless. Alb. Prophetess, what then? We'll pry fate's doors a little wider; speak! Leo. Your carrion shall be borne before a host, Till it offend the decency of sense. Living, you made Castile your foul abodeâ Dying, you'll make it loathsome! Wretched man, The hand you've raised shall crush you to the earth; The snares you lay shall tangle your own feet; The friends you've made shall make themselves your foes; The foes you've made shall be your only friends! And, in the sight of triumph, murderous death Shall snatch you suddenly! Alb. Hey! Coronelâ What was it, Coronel?âa crown of thorns? Right, strangely right!âa crown of thorns, indeed! Methinks, I feel them sting! [Exit slowly.] Leo. Juana, daughter, 'T is sweet to die within thy loving arms; But take thy hand away; thou hold'st me backâ Remove thy hand, and let the wound aloneâ Thou hold'st me back from heaven. That's kindly done! See, how the little river steals away! On that I'll float to heaven. Forgive the queen; And say good-night to all, for Leonor. When thy Enrique 's kingâPray, trim the lightsâ I faint with thirstâsome drinkâAlfonsoâO! [Dies.] DoÃ±a M. I know not that I am avenged, at last. FRANCESCA DA RIMINI: A TRAGEDY. Francesca, i tuoi martiri A lagrimar mi fanno tristo e pio. Dante. DRAMATIS PERSONÃ. Malatesta, Lord of Rimini. Guido da Polenta, Lord of Ravenna. Lanciotto, Malatesta's son. Paolo, His brother. PepÃ©, Malatesta's jester Cardinal, Friend to Guido. RenÃ©, A troubadour. Francesca da Rimini, Guido's daughter. Ritta, Her maid. Lords, Ladies, Knights, Priests, Soldiers, Pages, Attendants, &amp;c. Scene, Rimini, Ravenna, and the neighborhood. Time, about 1300 A. D. ACT I. SCENE I. Rimini. The Garden of the Palace. Paolo and a number of noblemen are discovered, seated under an arbor, surrounded by Rene, and other Troubadours, attendants, &amp;c. Paolo. I prithee, Rene, charm our ears again With the same song you sang me yesterday. Here are fresh listeners. Rene. Really, my good lord, My voice is out of joint. A grievous coldâ [Coughs.] Paolo. A very grievous, but convenient cold, Which always racks you when you would not sing. Rene. O, no, my lord! Besides, I hoped to hear My ditty warbled into fairer ears, By your own lips; to better purpose, too. [The Noblemen all laugh.] First Nobleman. Rene has hit it. Music runs to waste In ears like ours. Second Nobleman. Nay, nay; chaunt on, sweet Count. Paolo. (Coughing.) Alack! you hear, I've caught poor Rene's cough. First N. That would not be, if we wore petticoats. [The others laugh.] Paolo. O, fie! First N. So runs the scandal to our ears. Second N. Confirmed by all our other senses, Count. First N. Witnessed by many a doleful sigh, poured out By many a breaking heart in Rimini. Second N. Poor girls! First N. (Mimicking a lady.) Sweet Count! sweet Count Paolo! O! Plant early violets upon my grave! Thus go a thousand voices to one tune. [The others laugh.] Paolo. 'Ods mercy! gentlemen, you do me wrong. First N. And by how many hundred, more or less? Paolo. Ah! rogues, you 'd shift your sins upon my shoulders. Second N. You 'd bear them stoutly. First N. It were vain to give Drops to god Neptune. You 're the sea of love That swallows all things. Second N. We the little fish That meanly scull about within your depths. Paolo. Go on, go on! Talk yourselves fairly out. [Pepe laughs without.] But, hark! here comes the fool. Fit company For this most noble company of wits! (Enter Pepe, laughing violently.) Why do you laugh? Pepe. I'm laughing at the world. It has laughed long enough at me; and so I'll turn the tables. Ho! ho! ho! I 've heard A better joke of Uncle Malatesta's Than any I e'er uttered. [Laughing.] All. Tell it, fool. Pepe. Why, do you knowâupon my life, the best And most original idea on earth: A joke to put in practice, too. By Jove! I'll bet my wit 'gainst the stupidity Of the best gentleman among you all, You cannot guess it. All. Tell us, tell us, fool. Pepe. Guess it, guess it, fools. Paolo. Come, disclose, disclose! Pepe. He has a match afoot.â All. A match! Pepe. A marriage. All. Who?âwho? Pepe. A marriage in his family. All. But, who? Pepe. Ah! there 's the point. All. Paolo? Pepe. No. First N. The others are well wived. Shall we turn Turks? Pepe. Why, there 's the summit of his joke, good sirs. By all the sacred symbols of my artâ By cap and bauble, by my tinkling bellâ He means to marry Lanciotto! [Laughs violently.] All. (Laughing.) Ho!â Paolo. Peace! peace! What tongue dare echo you fool's laugh? Nay, never raise your hands in wonderment: I'll strike the dearest friend among ye all Beneath my feet, as if he were a slave, Who dares insult my brother with a laugh! Pepe. By Jove! ye 're sad enough. Here 's mirth's quick cure! Pretty Paolo has a heavy fist, I warn you, sirs. Ho! ho! I trapped them all; [Laughing.] Now I'll go mar old Malatesta's message. [Aside.] [Exit.] Paolo. Shame on ye, sirs! I have mistaken you. I thought I harbored better friends. Poor fops, Who 've slept in down and satin all your years, Within the circle Lanciotto charmed Round Rimini with his most potent sword!â Fellows whose brows would melt beneath a casque, Whose hands would fray to grasp a brand's rough hilt, Who ne'er launched more than braggart threats at foes!â Girlish companions of luxurious girls!â Danglers round troubadours and wine-cups!âMen Whose best parts are their clothes! bundles of silk, Scented like summer! rag-men, nothing more!â Creatures as generous as monkeysâbrave As hunted haresâcourteous as grinning apesâ Grateful as serpentsâuseful as lap-dogsâ [During this, the Noblemen, &amp;c., steal off.] Ha! I am alone at last! So let me be, Till Lanciotto fill the vacant room Of these mean knaves, whose friendship is but breath. [Exit.] SCENE II. The Same. A Hall in the Castle. Enter Malatesta and Lanciotto. Malatesta. Guido, ay, Guido of Ravenna, sonâ Down on his knees, as full of abject prayers For peace and mercy as a penitent. Lanciotto. His old trick, father. While his wearied arm Is raised in seeming prayer, it only rests. Anon, he'll deal you such a staggering blow, With its recovered strength, as shall convert You, and not him, into a penitent. Mal. No, no; your last bout levelled him. He reeled Into Ravenna, from the battle-field, Like a stripped drunkard, and there headlong fellâ A mass of squalid misery, a thing To draw the jeering urchins. I have this From faithful spies. There 's not a hope remains To break the shock of his great overthrow. I pity Guido. Lan. 'Sdeath! go comfort him! I pity those who fought, and bled, and died, Before the armies of this Ghibelin. I pity those who halted home with wounds Dealt by his hand. I pity widowed eyes That he set running; maiden hearts that turn, Sick with despair, from ranks thinned down by him; Mothers that shriek, as the last stragglers fling Their feverish bodies by the fountain-side, Dumb with mere thirst, and faintly point to him, Answering the dame's quick questions. I have seen Unburied bones, and skullsâthat seemed to ask, From their blank eye-holes, vengeance at my handâ Shine in the moonlight on old battle-fields; And even theseâthe happy dead, my lordâ I pity more than Guido of Ravenna! Mal. What would you have? Lan. I'd see Ravenna burn, Flame into heaven, and scorch the flying clouds; I 'd choke her streets with ruined palaces; I 'd hear her women scream with fear and grief, As I have heard the maids of Rimini. All this I 'd sprinkle with old Guido's blood, And bless the baptism. Mal. You are cruel. Lan. Not I; But these things ache within my fretting brain. The sight I first beheld was from the arms Of my wild nurse, her husband hacked to death By the fierce edges of these Ghibelins. One cut across the neckâI see it now, Ay, and have mimicked it a thousand times, Just as I saw it, on our enemies.â Why, that cut seemed as if it meant to bleed On till the judgment. My distracted nurse Stooped down, and paddled in the running gore With her poor fingers; then a prophetess, Pale with the inspiration of the god, She towered aloft, and with her dripping hand Three times she signed me with the holy cross. 'T is all as plain as noon-day. Thus she spake,â âMay this spot stand till Guido's dearest blood Be mingled with thy own!â The soldiers say, In the close battle, when my wrath is up, The dead man's blood flames on my vengeful brow Like a red planet; and when war is o'er, It shrinks into my brain, defiling all My better nature with its slaughterous lusts. Howe'er it be, it shaped my earliest thought, And it will shape my last. Mal. You moody churl! You dismal knot of superstitious dreams! Do you not blush to empty such a head Before a sober man? Why, son, the world Has not given o'er its laughing humor yet, That you should try it with such vagaries.âPoh! I'll get a wife to teach you common sense. Lan. A wife for me! [Laughing.] Mal. Ay, sir, a wife for you. You shall be married, to insure your wits. Lan. 'T is not your wont to mock me. Mal. How now, son! I am not given to jesting. I have chosen The fairest wife in Italy for you. You won her bravely, as a soldier should: And when you 'd woo her, stretch your gauntlet out, And crush her fingers in its steely grip. If you will plead, I ween, she dare not sayâ No, by your leave. Should she refuse, howe'er, With that same iron hand you shall go knock Upon Ravenna's gates, till all the town Ring with your courtship. I have made her hand The price and pledge of Guido's future peace. Lan. All this is done! Mal. Done, out of hand; and now I wait a formal answer, nothing more. Guido dare not decline. No, by the saints, He 'd send Ravenna's virgins here in droves, To buy a ten days' truce. Lan. Sir, let me say, You stretch paternal privilege too far, To pledge my hand without my own consent. Am I a portion of your household stuff, That you should trade me off to Guido thus? Who is the lady I am bartered for? Mal. Francesca, Guido's daughter.âNever frown; It shall be so! Lan. By heaven, it shall not be! My blood shall never mingle with his race. Mal. According to your nurse's prophecy, Fate orders it. Lan. Ha! Mal. Now, then, I have struck The chord that answers to your gloomy thoughts. Bah! on your sibyl and her prophecy! Put Guido's blood aside, and yet, I say, Marry you shall. Lan. 'T is most distasteful, sir. Mal. Lanciotto, look ye! You brave gentlemen, So fond of knocking out poor people's brains, In time must come to have your own knocked out: What, then, if you bequeath us no new hands, To carry on your business, and our house Die out for lack of princes? Lan. Wed my brothers: They'll rear you sons, I'll slay you enemies. Paolo and Francesca! Note their names; They chime together like sweet marriage-bells. A proper match. 'T is said she 's beautiful; And he is the delight of Rimini,â The pride and conscious centre of all eyes, The theme of poets, the ideal of art, The earthly treasury of Heaven's best gifts! I am a soldier; from my very birth, Heaven cut me out for terror, not for love. I had such fancies once, but nowâ Mal. Pshaw! son, My faith is bound to Guido; and if you Do not throw off your duty, and defy, Through sickly scruples, my express commands, You'll yield at once. No more: I'll have it so! [Exit.] Lan. Curses upon my destiny! What, Iâ Ho! I have found my use at lastâWhat, I, I, the great twisted monster of the wars, The brawny cripple, the herculean dwarf, The spur of panic, and the butt of scornâ I be a bridegroom! Heaven, was I not cursed More than enough, when thou didst fashion me To be a type of ugliness,âa thing By whose comparison all Rimini Holds itself beautiful? Lo! here I stand, A gnarlÃ©d, blighted trunk! There 's not a knave So spindle-shanked, so wry-faced, so infirm, Who looks at me, and smiles not on himself. And I have friends to pity meâgreat Heaven! One has a favorite leg that he bewails,â Another sees my hip with doleful plaints,â A third is sorry o'er my huge swart arms,â A fourth aspires to mount my very hump, And thence harangue his weeping brotherhood! Pah! it is nauseous! Must I further bear The sidelong shuddering glances of a wife? The degradation of a showy love, That over-acts, and proves the mummer's craft Untouched by nature? And a fair wife, too!â Francesca, whom the minstrels sing about! Though, by my side, what woman were not fair? Circe looked well among her swine, no doubt; Next me, she'd pass for Venus. Ho! ho! ho! [Laughing. Would there were something merry in my laugh! Now, in the battle, if a Ghibelin Cry, âWry-hip! hunchback!â I can trample him Under my stallion's hoofs; or haggle him Into a monstrous likeness of myself: But to be pitied,âto endure a sting Thrust in by kindness, with a sort of smile!â 'Sdeath! it is miserable! (Enter Pepe.) Pepe. My lordâ Lan. My fool! Pepe. We'll change our titles when your bride's bells ringâ Ha, cousin? Lan. Even this poor fool has eyes, To see the wretched plight in which I stand. [Aside.] How, gossip, how? Pepe. I, being the court-fool, Am lord of fools by my prerogative. Lan. Who told you of my marriage? Pepe. Rimini! A frightful liar; but true for once, I fear. The messenger from Guido has returned, And the whole town is wailing over him. Some pity you, and some the bride; but I, Being more catholic, I pity both. Lan. Still, pity, pity! (Aside. Bells toll.) Ha! whose knell is that? Pepe. Lord Malatesta sent me to the tower, To have the bells rung for your marriage-news. How, he said not; so I, as I thought fit, Told the deaf sexton to ring out a knell. [Bells toll.] How do you like it? Lan. Varlet, have you bones, To risk their breaking? I have half a mind To thresh you from your motley coat! [Seizes him.] Pepe. Pardee! Respect my coxcomb, cousin. Hark! ha, ha! [Laughing.] (Bells ring a joyful peal.) Some one has changed my music. Heaven defend! How the bells jangle! Yonder graybeard, now, Rings a peal vilely. He 's more used to knells, And sounds them grandly. Only give him time, And, I'll be sworn, he'll ring your knell out yet. Lan. Pepe, you are but half a fool. Pepe. My lord, I can return the compliment in full. Lan. So, you are ready. Pepe. Truth is always so. Lan. I shook you rudely; here 's a florin. [Offers money.] Pepe. No: My wit is merchandise, but not my honor. Lan. Your honor, sirrah! Pepe. Why not? You great lords Have something you call lordly honor; pray, May not a fool have foolish honor too? Cousin, you laid your hand upon my coatâ 'T was the first sacrilege it ever knewâ And you shall pay it. Mark! I promise you. Lan. (Laughing.) Ha, ha! you bluster well. Upon my life, You have the tilt-yard jargon to a breath. Pepe, if I should smite you on the cheekâ Thus, gossip, thusâ(Strikes him.) what would you then demand? Pepe. Your life! Lan. (Laughing.) Ha, ha! there is the camp-style tooâ A very cut-throat air! How this shrewd fool Makes the punctilio of honor show! Change helmets into coxcombs, swords to baubles, And what a figure is poor chivalry! Thanks for your lesson, Pepe! [Exit.] Pepe. Ere I 'm done, You'll curse as heartily, you limping beast! Ha! so we goâLord Lanciotto, look! [Walks about, mimicking him.] Here is a leg and camel-back, forsooth, To match your honor and nobility! You miscreated scarecrow, dare you shake, Or strike in jest, a natural man like me?â You cursÃ©d lump, you chaos of a man, To buffet one whom Heaven pronounces good! [Bells ring.] There go the bells rejoicing over you: I'll change them back to the old knell again. You marry, faugh! Beget a race of elves; Wed a she-crocodile, and keep within The limits of your nature! Here we go, Tripping along to meet our promised bride, Like a rheumatic elephant!âha, ha! [Laughing.] [Exit, mimicking Lanciotto.] SCENE III. The Same. A Room in the Same. Enter Lanciotto, hastily. Lanciotto. Why do these prodigies environ me? In ancient Rome, the words a fool might drop, From the confusion of his vagrant thoughts, Were held as omens, prophecies; and men Who made earth tremble with majestic deeds, Trembled themselves at fortune's lightest threat. I like it not. My father named this match While I boiled over with vindictive wrath Towards Guido and Ravenna. Straight my heart Sank down like lead; a weakness seized on me, A dismal gloom that I could not resist; I lacked the power to take my stand, and sayâ Bluntly, I will not! Am I in the toils? Has fate so weakened me, to work its end? There seems a fascination in it, too,â A morbid craving to pursue a thing Whose issue may be fatal. Would that I Were in the wars again! These mental weeds Grow on the surface of inactive peace. I'm haunted by myself. Thought preys on thought My mind seems crowded in the hideous mould That shaped my body. What a fool am I To bear the burden of my wretched life, To sweat and toil under the world's broad eye, Climb into fame, and find myselfâO, what?â A most conspicuous monster! Crown my head, Pile CÃ¦sar's purple on meâand what then? My hump shall shorten the imperial robe, My leg peep out beneath the scanty hem, My broken hip shall twist the gown awry; And pomp, instead of dignifying me, Shall be by me made quite ridiculous. The faintest coward would not bear all this: Prodigious courage must be mine, to live; To die asks nothing but weak will, and I Feel like a craven. Let me skulk away Ere life o'ertask me. [Offers to stab himself.] (Enter Paolo.) Paolo. (Seizing his hand.) Brother! what is this? Lanciotto, are you mad? Kind Heaven! look hereâ Straight in my eyes. Now answer, do you know How near you were to murder? Dare you bend Your wicked hand against a heart I love? Were it for you to mourn your wilful death, With such a bitterness as would be ours, The wish would ne'er have crossed you. While we 're bound Life into life, a chain of loving hearts, Were it not base in you, the middle link, To snap, and scatter all? Shame, brother, shame! I thought you better metal. Lan. Spare your words. I know the seasons of our human grief, And can predict them without almanac. A few sobs o'er the body, and a few Over the coffin; then a sigh or two, Whose windy passage dries the hanging tear; Perchance, some wandering memories, some regrets; Then a vast influx of consoling thoughtsâ Based on the trials of the sadder days Which the dead missed; and then a smiling face Turned on to-morrow. Such is mortal grief. It writes its histories within a span, And never lives to read them. Paolo. Lanciotto, I heard the bells of Rimini, just now, Exulting o'er your coming marriage-day, While you conspired to teach them gloomier sounds. Why are you sad? Lan. Paolo, I am wretched; Sad 's a faint word. But of my marriage-bellsâ Heard you the knell that Pepe rang? Paolo. 'T was strange: A sullen antic of his crabbed wit. Lan. It was portentous. All dumb things find tongues Against this marriage. As I passed the hall, My armor glittered on the wall, and I Paused by the harness, as before a friend Whose well-known features slack our hurried gait; Francesca's name was fresh upon my mind, So I half-uttered it. Instant, my sword Leaped from its scabbard, as with sudden life, Plunged down and pierced into the oaken floor, Shivering with fear! Lo! while I gazed upon itâ Doubting the nature of the accidentâ Around the point appeared a spot of blood, Oozing upon the floor, that spread and spreadâ As I stood gasping by in speechless horrorâ Ring beyond ring, until the odious tide Crawled to my feet, and lapped them, like the tongues Of angry serpents! O, my God! I fled At the first touch of the infernal stain! Goâyou may seeâgo to the hall! Paolo. Fie! man, You have been ever played on in this sort By your wild fancies. When your heart is high, You make them playthings; but in lower moods, They seem to sap the essence of your soul, And drain your manhood to its poorest dregs. Lan. Go look, go look! Paolo. (Goes to the door, and returns.) There sticks the sword, indeed, Just as your tread detached it from its sheath; Looking more like a blessed cross, I think, Than a bad omen. As for bloodâHa, ha! [Laughing.] It sets mine dancing. Pshaw! away with this! Deck up your face with smiles. Go trim yourself For the young bride. New velvet, gold, and gems, Do wonders for us. Brother, come; I'll be Your tiring-man, for once. Lan. Array this lumpâ Paolo, hark! There are some human thoughts Best left imprisoned in the aching heart, Lest the freed malefactors should dispread Infamous ruin with their liberty. There 's not a manâthe fairest of ye allâ Who is not fouler than he seems. This life Is one unending struggle to conceal Our baseness from our fellows. Here stands one In vestal whiteness with a lecher's lust;â There sits a judge, holding law's scales in hands That itch to take the bribe he dare not touch;â Here goes a priest, with heavenward eyes, whose soul Is Satan's council-chamber;âthere a doctor, With nature's secrets wrinkled round a brow Guilty with conscious ignorance;âand here A soldier rivals Hector's bloody deedsâ Out-does the devil in audacityâ With craven longings fluttering in a heart That dares do aught but fly! Thus are we all Mere slaves and alms-men to a scornful world, That takes us at our seeming. Paolo. Say 't is true; What do you drive at? Lan. At myself, full tilt. I, like the others, am not what I seem. Men call me gentle, courteous, brave.âThey lie! I'm harsh, rude, and a coward. Had I nerve To cast my devils out upon the earth, I 'd show this laughing planet what a hell Of envy, malice, cruelty, and scorn, It has forced back to canker in the heart Of one poor cripple! Paolo. Ha! Lan. Ay, now 't is out! A word I never breathed to man before. Can you, who are a miracle of grace, Feel what it is to be a wreck like me? Paolo, look at me. Is there a line, In my whole bulk of wretched contraries, That nature in a nightmare ever used Upon her shapes till now? Find me the man, Or beast, or tree, or rock, or nameless thing, So out of harmony with all things else, And I'll go raving with bare happiness,â Ay, and I'll marry Helena of Greece, And swear I do her honor! Paolo. Lanciotto, I, who have known you from a stripling up, Never observed, or, if I did, ne'er weighed Your special difference from the rest of men. You 're not Apolloâ Lan. No! Paolo. Nor yet are you A second Pluto. Could I change with youâ My graces for your nobler qualitiesâ Your strength, your courage, your renownâby heaven, We 'd e'en change persons, to the finest hair. Lan. You should be flatterer to an emperor. Paolo. I am but just. Let me beseech you, brother, To look with greater favor on yourself; Nor suffer misty phantoms of your brain To take the place of sound realities. Go to Ravenna, wed your bride, and lull Your cruel delusions in domestic peace. Ghosts fly a fireside: 't is their wont to stalk Through empty houses, and through empty hearts. I know Francesca will be proud of you. Women admire you heroes. Rusty sages, Pale poets, and scarred warriors, have been Their idols ever; while we fair plump fools Are elbowed to the wall, or only used For vacant pastime. Lan. To Ravenna?âno! In Rimini they know me; at Ravenna I 'd be a new-come monster, and exposed To curious wonder. There will be parade Of all the usual follies of the state; Fellows with trumpets, tinselled coats, and wands, Would strut before me, like vain mountebanks Before their monkeys. Then, I should be stared Out of my modesty; and when they look, How can I tell if 't is the bridegroom's face Or hump that draws their eyes? I will not go. To please you all, I'll marry; but to please The wonder-mongers of RavennaâHa! Paolo, now I have it. You shall go, To bring Francesca; and you'll speak of me, Not as I ought to be, but as I am. If she draw backward, give her rein; and say That neither Guido nor herself shall feel The weight of my displeasure. You may say, I pity herâ Paolo. For what? Lan. For wedding me. In sooth, she'll need it. Sayâ Paolo. Nay, Lanciotto, I'll be a better orator in your behalf, Without your promptings. Lan. She is fair, 't is said; And, dear Paolo, if she please your eye, And move your heart to anything like love, Wed her yourself. The peace would stand as firm By such a match. Paolo. (Laughing.) Ha! that is right: be gay! Ply me with jokes! I 'd rather see you smile Than see the sun shine. Lan. I am serious. I'll find another wife, less beautiful, More on my level, andâ Paolo. An empress, brother, Were honored by your hand. You are by much Too humble in your reckoning of yourself. I can count virtues in you, to supply Half Italy, if they were parcelled out. Look up! Lan. I cannot: Heaven has bent me down. To you, Paolo, I could look, however, Were my hump made a mountain. Bless him, God! Pour everlasting bounties on his head! Make CrÅsus jealous of his treasury, Achilles of his arms, Endymion Of his fresh beauties,âthough the coy one lay, Blushing beneath Diana's earliest kiss, On grassy Latmos; and may every good, Beyond man's sight, though in the ken of Heaven, Round his fair fortune to a perfect end! O, you have dried the sorrow of my eyes; My heart is beating with a lighter pulse; The air is musical; the total earth Puts on new beauty, and within the arms Of girding ocean dreams her time away, And visions bright to-morrows! (Enter Malatesta and Pepe.) Malatesta. Mount, to horse! Pepe. (Aside.) Good Lord! he 's smiling! What 's the matter now? Has anybody broken a leg or back? Has a more monstrous monster come to life? Is hell burst open?âheaven burnt up? What, what Can make yon eyesore grin?âI say, my lord, What cow has calved? Paolo. Your mother, by the bleat. Pepe. Right fairly answeredâfor a gentleman! When did you take my trade up? Paolo. When your wit Went begging, sirrah. Pepe. Well again! My lord, I think he'll do. Mal. For what? Pepe. To take my place. Once fools were rare, and then my office sped; But now the world is overrun with them: One gets one 's fool in one 's own family, Without much searching. Mal. Pepe, gently now. Lanciotto, you are waited for. The train Has passed the gate, and halted there for you. Lan. I go not to Ravenna. Mal. Hey! why not? Paolo. For weighty reasons, father. Will you trust Your greatest captain, hope of all the Guelfs, With crafty Guido? Should the Ghibelins Break faith, and shut Lanciotto in their wallsâ Sure the temptation would be great enoughâ What would you do? Mal. I 'd eat Ravenna up! Pepe. Lord! what an appetite! Paolo. But Lanciotto Would be a precious hostage. Mal. True; you 're wise; Guido 's a fox. Well, have it your own way. What is your plan? Paolo. I go there in his place. Mal. Good! I will send a letter with the news. Lan. I thank you, brother. [Apart to Paolo.] Pepe. Ha! ha! ha!âO! O! [Laughing.] Mal. Pepe, what now? Pepe. O! lord, O!âho! ho! ho! [Laughing.] Paolo. Well, giggler? Pepe. Hear my fable, uncle. Mal. Ay. Pepe. Once on a time, Vulcan sent Mercury To fetch dame Venus from a romp in heaven. Well, they were long in coming, as he thought; And so the god of spits and gridirons Railed like himselfâthe devil. Butânow markâ Here comes the moral. In a little while, Vulcan grew proud, because he saw plain signs That he should be a father; and so he Strutted through hell, and pushed the devils by, Like a magnifico of Venice. Ere long, His heir was born; but thenâho! ho!âthe brat Had wings upon his heels, and thievish ways, And a vile squint, like errant Mercury's, Which honest Vulcan could not understand;â Can you? Paolo. 'Sdeath! fool, I'll have you in the stocks. Father, your fool exceeds his privilege. Pepe. (Apart to Paolo.) Keep your own bounds, Paolo. In the stocks I 'd tell more fables than you 'd wish to hear. And so ride forth. But, cousin, don't forget To take Lanciotto's picture to the bride. Ask her to choose between it and yourself. I'll count the moments, while she hesitates, And not grow gray at it. Paolo. Peace, varlet, peace! Pepe. (Apart to him.) Ah! now I have it. There 's an elephant Upon the scutcheon; show her that, and sayâ Here 's Lanciotto in our heraldry! Paolo. Here 's for your counsel! [Strikes Pepe, who runs behind Malatesta.] Mal. Son, son, have a care! We who keep pets must bear their pecks sometimes. Poor knave! Ha! ha! thou 'rt growing villanous! [Laughs and pats Pepe.] Pepe. Another blow! another life for that! [Aside.] Paolo. Farewell, Lanciotto. You are dull again. Lan. Nature will rule. Mal. Come, come! Lan. God speed you, brother! I am too sad; my smiles all turn to sighs. Paolo. More cause to haste me on my happy work. [Exit with Malatesta.] Pepe. I'm going, cousin. Lan. Go. Pepe. Pray, ask me where. Lan. Where, then? Pepe. To have my jewel carried home: And, as I'm wise, the carrier shall be A thief, a thief, by Jove! The fashion 's new. [Exit.] Lan. In truth, I am too gloomy and irrational. Paolo must be right. I always had These moody hours and dark presentiments, Without mischances following after them. The camp is my abode. A neighing steed, A fiery onset, and a stubborn fight, Rouse my dull blood, and tire my body down To quiet slumbers when the day is o'er, And night above me spreads her spangled tent, Lit by the dying cresset of the moon. Ay, that is it; I'm homesick for the camp. [Exit.] ACT II. SCENE I. Ravenna. A Room in Guido's Palace. Enter Guido and a Cardinal. Cardinal. I warn thee, Count. Guido. I'll take the warning, father, On one condition: show me but a way For safe escape. Car. I cannot. Gui. There 's the point: We Ghibelins are fettered hand and foot. There 's not a florin in my treasury; Not a lame soldier, I can lead to war; Not one to man the walls. A present siege, Pushed with the wonted heat of Lanciotto, Would deal Ravenna such a mortal blow As ages could not mend. Give me but time To fill the drainÃ©d arteries of the land. The Guelfs are masters, we their slaves; and we Were wiser to confess it, ere the lash Teach it too sternly. It is well for you To say you love Francesca. So do I; But neither you nor I have any voice For or against this marriage. Car. 'T is too true. Gui. Say we refuse: Why, then, before a week, We'll hear Lanciotto rapping at our door, With twenty hundred ruffians at his back. What 's to say then? My lord, we waste our breath. Let us look fortune in the face, and draw Such comfort from the wanton as we may. Car. And yet I fearâ Gui. You fear! and so do I. I fear Lanciotto as a soldier, though, More than a son-in-law. Car. But have you seen him? Gui. Ay, ay, and felt him, too. I 've seen him ride The best battalions of my horse and foot Down like mere stubble: I have seen his sword Hollow a square of pikemen, with the ease You 'd scoop a melon out. Car. Report declares him A prodigy of strength and ugliness. Gui. Were he the devilâBut why talk of this?â Here comes Francesca. Car. Ah! unhappy child! Gui. Look you, my lord! you'll make the best of it; You will not whimper. Add your voice to mine, Or woe to poor Ravenna! (Enter Francesca and Ritta.) Francesca. Ha! my lordâ And you, my father!âBut do I intrude Upon your counsels? How severe you look! Shall I retire? Gui. No, no. Fran. You moody men Seem leagued against me. As I passed the hall, I met your solemn Dante, with huge strides Pacing in measure to his stately verse. The sweeping sleeves of his broad scarlet robe Blew out behind, like wide-expanded wings, And seemed to buoy him in his level flight. Thinking to pass, without disturbing him, I stole on tip-toe; but the poet paused, Subsiding into man, and steadily Bent on my face the lustre of his eyes. Then, taking both my trembling hands in hisâ You know how his God-troubled forehead awesâ He looked into my eyes, and shook his head, As if he dared not speak of what he saw; Then muttered, sighed, and slowly turned away The weight of his intolerable brow. When I glanced back, I saw him, as before, Sailing adown the hall on out-spread wings. Indeed, my lord, he should not do these things: They strain the weakness of mortality A jot too far. As for poor Ritta, she Fled like a doe, the truant. Ritta. Yes, forsooth: There 's something terrible about the man. Ugh! if he touched me, I should turn to ice. I wonder if Count Lanciotto looksâ Gui. Ritta, come here. [Takes her apart.] Rit. My lord. Gui. 'T was my command, You should say nothing of Count Lanciotto. Rit. Nothing, my lord. Gui. You have said nothing, then? Rit. Indeed, my lord. Gui. 'T is well. Some years ago, My daughter had a very silly maid, Who told her sillier stories. So, one day, This maiden whispered something I forbadeâ In strictest confidence, for she was sly: What happened, think you? Rit. I know not, my lord. Gui. I boiled her in a pot. Rit. Good heaven! my lord. Gui. She did not like it. I shall keep that pot Ready for the next boiling. [Walks back to the others.] Rit. Saints above! I wonder if he ate her! Boil meâme! I'll roast or stew with pleasure; but to boil Implies a want of tenderness,âor rather A downright toughnessâin the matter boiled, That 's slanderous to a maiden. What, boil meâ Boil me! O! mercy, how ridiculous! [Retires, laughing.] (Enter a Messenger.) Messenger. Letters, my lord, from great Prince Malatesta. [Presents them, and exit.] Gui. (Aside.) Hear him, ye gods!ââfrom great Prince Malatesta!â Greeting, no doubt, his little cousin Guido. Well, well, just so we see-saw up and down. [Reads.] âFearing our treachery,ââby heaven, that 's blunt, And Malatesta-like!ââhe will not send His son, Lanciotto, to Ravenna, butââ But what?âa groom, a porter? or will he Have his prey sent him in an iron cage? By Jove, he shall not have her! O! no, no; âHe sends his younger son, the Count Paolo, To fetch Francesca back to Rimini.â That 's well, if he had left his reasons out. And, in a postscriptâby the saints, 't is droll!â â'Twould not be worth your lordship's while, to shut Paolo in a prison; for, my lord, I'll only pay his ransom in plain steel: Besides, he 's not worth having.â Is there one, Save this ignoble offshoot of the Goths, Who 'd write such garbage to a gentleman? Take that, and read it. [Gives letter to Cardinal.] Car. I have done the most. She seems suspicious. Gui. Ritta's work. Car. Farewell! [Exit.] Fran. Father, you seem distempered. Gui. No, my child, I am but vexed. Your husband 's on the road, Close to Ravenna. What 's the time of day? Fran. Past noon, my lord. Gui. We must be stirring, then. Fran. I do not like this marriage. Gui. But I do. Fran. But I do not. Poh! to be given away, Like a fine horse or falcon, to a man Whose face I never saw! Rit. That's it, my lady. Gui. Ritta, run down, and see if my great pot Boils to your liking. Rit. (Aside.) O! that pot again! My lord, my heart betrays me; but you know How true 't is to my lady. [Exit.] Fran. What ails Ritta? Gui. The ailing of your sex, a running tongue. Francesca, 't is too late to beat retreat: Old Malatesta has meâyou, too, childâ Safe in his clutch. If you are not content, I must unclose Ravenna, and allow His son to take you. Poh, poh! have a soul Equal with your estate. A prince's child Cannot choose husbands. Her desires must aim, Not at herself, but at the public good. Both as your prince and father, I command; As subject and good daughter, you'll obey. Fran. I knew that it must be my destiny, Some day, to give my hand without my heart; Butâ Gui. But, and I will but you back again! When Guido da Polenta says to you, Daughter, you must be married,âwhat were best? Fran. 'T were best Francesca, of the self-same name, Made herself bridal-garments. [Laughing.] Gui. Right! Fran. My lord, Is Lanciotto handsomeâuglyâfairâ Blackâsallowâcrabbedâkindâor what is he? Gui. You'll know ere long. I could not alter him, To please your taste. Fran. You always put me off; You never have a whisper in his praise. Gui. The world reports it.âCount my soldiers' scars, And you may sum Lanciotto's glories up. Fran. I shall be dutiful, to please you, father. If aught befall me through my blind submission, Though I may suffer, you must bear the sin. Beware, my lord, for your own peace of mind! My part has been obedience; and now I play it over to complete my task; And it shall be with smiles upon my lips,â Heaven only knows with what a sinking heart! [Exeunt.] SCENE II. The Same. Before the Gates of the City. The walls hung with banners, flowesr, &amp;c., and crowded with citizens. At the side of the scene is a canopied dais, with chairs of state upon it. Music, bells, shouts, and other sounds of rejoicing, are occasionally heard. Enter Guido, the Cardinal, Noblemen, Knights, Guards, &amp;c., with banners, arms, &amp;c. Guido. My lord, I'll have it so. You talk in vain. Paolo is a marvel in his way: I 've seen him often. If Francesca take A fancy to his beauty, all the better; For she may think that he and Lanciotto Are like as blossoms of one parent branch. In truth, they are, so far as features goâ Heaven help the rest! Get her to Rimini, By any means, and I shall be content. The fraud cannot last long; but long enough To win her favor to the family. Cardinal. 'T is a dull trick. Thou hast not dealt with her Wisely nor kindly, and I dread the end. If, when this marriage was enjoined on thee, Thou hadst informed Francesca of the truth, And said, Now, daughter, choose between Thy peace and all Ravenna's; who that knows The constant nature of her noble heart Could doubt the issue? There 'd have been some tears, Some frightful fancies of her husband's looks; And then she 'd calmly walk up to her fate, And bear it bravely. Afterwards, perchance, Lanciotto might prove better than her fears,â No one denies him many an excellence,â And all go happily. But, as thou wouldst plot, She'll be prepared to see a paragon, And find a satyr. It is dangerous. Treachery with enemies is bad enough, With friends 't is fatal. Gui. Has your lordship done? Car. Never, Count Guido, with so good a text. Do not stand looking sideways at the truth; Craft has become thy nature. Go to her. Gui. I have not heart. Car. I have. [Going.] Gui. Hold, Cardinal! My plan is better. Get her off my hands, And I care not. Car. What will she say of thee, In Rimini, when she detects the cheat? Gui. I'll stop my ears up. Car. Guido, thou art weak, And lack the common fortitude of man. Gui. And you abuse the license of your garb, To lesson me. My lord, I do not dare To move a finger in these marriage-rites. Francesca is a sacrifice, I know,â A limb delivered to the surgeon's knife, To save our general health. A truce to this. Paolo has the business in his hands: Let him arrange it as he will; for I Will give Count Malatesta no pretext To recommence the war. Car. Farewell, my lord. I'll neither help nor countenance a fraud. You crafty men take comfort to yourselves, Saying, deceit dies with discovery. 'T is false; each wicked action spawns a brood, And lives in its succession. You, who shake Man's moral nature into storm, should know That the last wave which passes from your sight Rolls in and breaks upon eternity! [Exit.] Gui. Why, that 's a very grand and solemn thought: I'll mention it to Dante. Gentlemen, What see they from the wall? Nobleman The train, my lord. Gui. Inform my daughter. Nob. She is here, my lord. (Enter Francesca, Ritta, Ladies, Attendants, &amp;c.) Francesca. See, father, what a merry face I have, And how my ladies glisten! I will try To do my utmost, in my love for you And the good people of Ravenna. Now, As the first shock is over, I expect To feel quite happy. I will wed the Count, Be he whate'er he may. I do not speak In giddy recklessness. I 've weighed it all,â 'T wixt hope and fear, knowledge and ignorance,â And reasoned out my duty to your wish. I have no yearnings towards another love: So, if I show my husband a desire To fill the place with which he honors me, According to its duties, even heâ Were he less noble than Count Lanciottoâ Must smile upon my efforts, and reward Good will with willing grace. One pang remains. Parting from home and kindred is a thing None but the heartless, or the miserable, Can do without a tear. This home of mine Has filled my heart with two-fold happiness, Taking and giving love abundantly. Farewell, Ravenna! If I bless thee not, 'T is that thou seem'st too blessed; and 't were strange In me to offer what thou 'st always given. Gui. (Aside.) This is too much! If she would rail a while At me and fortune, it could be endured. [Shouts, music, &amp;c. within.] Fran. Ha! there 's the van just breaking through the wood! Music! that 's well; a welcome forerunner. Now, Rittaâhereâcome talk to me. Alas! How my heart trembles! What a world to me Lies 'neath the glitter of you cavalcade! Is that the Count? Ritta. Upon the dapple-gray? Fran. Yes, yes. Rit. No; that 's hisâ Gui. (Apart to her.) Ritta! Rit. Ay; that 'sâthat 'sâ Gui. Ritta, the pot! [Apart to her.] Rit. O! but this lying chokes! [Aside.] Ay, that 's Count Somebody, from Rimini. Fran. I knew it was. Is that not glorious? Rit. My lady, what? Fran. To see a cavalier Sit on his steed with such familiar grace. Rit. To see a man astraddle on a horse! It don't seem much to me. Fran. Fie! stupid girl! But mark the minstrels thronging round the Count! Ah! that is more than gallant horsemanship. The soul that feeds itself on poesy, Is of a quality more fine and rare Than Heaven allows the ruder multitude. I tell you, Ritta, when you see a man Beloved by poets, made the theme of song, And chaunted down to ages, as a gift Fit for the rich embalmment of their verse, There 's more about him than the patron's gold. If that 's the gentleman my father chose, He must have picked him out from all the world. The Count alights. Why, what a noble grace Runs through his slightest action! Are you sad? You too, my father? Have I given you cause? I am content. If Lanciotto's mind Bear any impress of his fair outside, We shall not quarrel ere our marriage-day. Can I say more? My blushes speak for me: Interpret them as modesty's excuse For the short-comings of a maiden's speech. Rit. Alas! dear lady! [Aside.] Gui. (Aside.) 'Sdeath! my plot has failed, By overworking its design. Come, come; Get to your places. See, the Count draws nigh. (Guido and Francesca seat themselves upon the dais, surrounded by Ritta, Ladies, Attendants, Guards, &amp;c, Music shouts, ringing of bells, &amp;c. Enter Men-at arms, with banners, &amp;c.; Pages bearing costly presents on cushions; then Paolo, surrounded by Noblemen, Knights, Minstrels, &amp;c., and followed by other Men-at-arms. They range themselves opposite the dais.) Gui. Ravenna welcomes you, my lord, and I Add my best greeting to the general voice. This peaceful show of arms from Rimini Is a new pleasure, stranger to our sense Than if the East blew zephyrs, or the balm Of Summer loaded rough December's gales, And turned his snows to roses. Paolo. Noble sir, We looked for welcome from your courtesy, Not from your love; but this unhoped for sight Of smiling faces, and the gentle tone In which you greet us, leave us naught to win Within your hearts. I need not ask, my lord, Where bides the precious object of my search; For I was sent to find the fairest maid Ravenna boasts, among her many fair. I might extend my travel many a league, And yet return, to take her from your side. I blush to bear so rich a treasure home, As pledge and hostage of a sluggish peace; For beauty such as hers was meant by Heaven To spur our race to gallant enterprise, And draw contending deities around The dubious battles of a second Troy. Gui. Sir Count, you please to lavish on my child The high-strained courtesy of chivalry; Yet she has homely virtues that, I hope, May take a deeper hold in Rimini, After the fleeting beauty of her face Is spoiled by time, or faded to the eye By its familiar usage. Paolo. As a man Who ever sees Heaven's purpose in its works, I must suppose so rare a tabernacle Was framed for rarest virtues. Pardon me My public admiration. If my praise Clash with propriety, and bare my words To cooler judgment, 't is not that I wish To win a flatterer's grudged recompense, And gain by falsehood what I 'd win through love. When I have brushed my travel from my garb, I'll pay my court in more befitting style. (Music. Exit with his train.) Gui. (Advancing.) Now, by the saints, Lanciotto's deputy Stands in this business with a proper grace, Stretching his lord's instructions till they crack. A zealous envoy! Not a word said he Of Lanciottoânot a single word; But stood there, staring in Francesca's face With his devouring eyes.âBy Jupiter, I but half like it! Fran. (Advancing.) Father? Gui. Well, my child. Fran. How do you likeâ Gui. The coxcomb! I 've done well! Fran. No, no; Count Lanciotto? Gui. Well enough. But hang this fellowâhang your deputies! I'll never woo by proxy. Fran. Deputies! And woo by proxy! Gui. Come to me anon. I'll strip this cuckoo of his gallantry! [Exit with Guards, &amp;c.] Fran. Ritta, my father has strange ways of late. Rit. I wonder not. Fran. You wonder not? Rit. No, lady: He is so used to playing double games, That even you must come in for your share. Plague on his boiling! I will out with it. [Aside.] Lady, the gentleman who passed the gatesâ Fran. Count Lanciotto? As I hope for grace, A gallant gentleman! How well he spoke! With what sincere and earnest courtesy The rounded phrases glided from his lips! He spoke in compliments that seemed like truth. Methinks I 'd listen through a summer's day, To hear him woo.âAnd he must woo to meâ I'll have our privilegeâhe must woo a space, Ere I'll be won, I promise. Rit. But, my lady, He'll woo you for another. Fran. He?âha! ha! [Laughing.] I should not think it from the prologue, Ritta. Rit. Nor I. Fran. Nor any one. Rit. 'T is not the Countâ 'T is not Count Lanciotto. Fran. Gracious saints! Have you gone crazy? Ritta, speak again, Before I chide you. Rit. 'T is the solemn truth. That gentleman is Count Paolo, lady, Brother to Lanciotto, and no more Like him thanâthanâ Fran. Than what? Rit. Count Guido's pot, For boiling waiting-maids, is like the bath Of Venus on the arras. Fran. Are you mad,â Quite mad, poor Ritta? Rit. Yes; perhaps I am. Perhaps Lanciotto is a proper manâ Perhaps I lieâperhaps I speak the truthâ Perhaps I gabble like a fool. O! heavens, That dreadful pot! Fran. Dear Ritta!â Rit. By the mass, They shall not cozen you, my gentle mistress! If my lord Guido boiled me, do you think I should be served up to the garrison, By way of pottage? Surely they would not waste me. Fran. You are an idle talker. Pranks like these Fit your companions. You forget yourself. Rit. Not you, though, lady. Boldly I repeat, That he who looked so fair, and talked so sweet, Who rode from Rimini upon a horse Of dapple-gray, and walked through yonder gate, Is not Count Lanciotto. Fran. This you mean? Rit. I do, indeed! Fran. Then I am more abusedâ More tricked, more trifled with, more played uponâ By him, my father, and by all of you, Than anything, suspected of a heart, Was ever yet! Rit. In Count Paolo, lady, Perchance there was no meditated fraud. Fran. How, dare you plead for him? Rit. I but suppose: Though in your fatherâO! I dare not say. Fran. I dare. It was ill usage, gross abuse, Treason to duty, meanness, craftâdishonor! What if I 'd thrown my heart before the feet Of this sham husband! cast my love away Upon a counterfeit! I was prepared To force affection upon any man Called Lanciotto. Anything of silk, Tinsel, and gewgaws, if he bore that name, Might have received me for the asking. Yes, I was inclined to venture more than half In this base businessâshame upon my thoughts!â All for my father's peace and poor Ravenna's. And this Paolo, with his cavalcade, His minstrels, music, and his pretty airs, His showy person, and his fulsome talk, Almost made me contented with my lot. O! what a fool!âin faith, I merit itâ Trapped by mere glitter! What an easy fool! Ha! ha! I'm glad it went no further, girl; [Laughing. I'm glad I kept my heart safe, after all. There was my cunning. I have paid them back, I warrant you! I'll marry Lanciotto; I'll seem to shuffle by this treachery. No! I'll seek my father, put him face to face With his own falsehood; and I'll stand between, Awful as justice, meting out to him Heaven's dreadful canons 'gainst his conscious guilt. I'll marry Lanciotto. On my faith, I would not live another wicked day Here, in Ravenna, only for the fear That I should take to lying, with the rest. Ha! ha! it makes me merry, when I think How safe I kept this little heart of mine! [Laughing.] [Exit, with Attendants, &amp;c.] Rit. So, 't is all endedâall except my boiling, And that will make a holiday for some. Perhaps I'm selfish. Fagot, axe, and gallows, They have their uses, after all. They give The lookers-on a deal of harmless sport. Though one may suffer, twenty hundred laugh; And that 's a point gained. I have seen a manâ Poor Dora's uncleâshake himself with glee, At the bare thought of the ridiculous style In which some villain died. âDancing,â quoth he, âTo the poor music of a single string! Biting,â quoth he, âafter his head was off! What use of that?â Or, âShivering,â quoth he, âAs from an ague, with his beard afire!â And then he 'd roar until his ugly mouth Split at the corners. But to see me boilâ O! that will be the queerest thing of all! I wonder if they'll put me in a bag, Like a great suet-ball? I'll go, and tell Count Guido, on the instant. How he'll laugh To think his pot has got an occupant! I wonder if he really takes delight In such amusements? Nay, I have kept faith: I only said the man was not Lanciotto; No word of Lanciotto's ugliness. I may escape the pot, for all. Pardee! I wonder if they'll put me in a bag! [Exit, laughing.] SCENE III. The Same. A Room in Guido's Palace. Enter Guido and Ritta. Ritta. There now, my lord, that is the whole of it: I love my mistress more than I fear you. If I could save her finger from the axe, I 'd give my head to do it. So, my lord, I am prepared to stew. Guido. Boil, Ritta, boil. Rit. No; I prefer to stew. Gui. And I to boil. Rit. 'T is very hard, my lord, I cannot choose My way of cooking. I shall laugh, I vow, In the grim headsman's face, when I remember That I am dying for my lady's love. I leave no one to shed a tear for me; Father nor mother, kith nor kin, have I, To say, âPoor Ritta!â o'er my lifeless clay. They all have gone before me, and 't were well If I could hurry after them. Gui. Poor child! [Aside But, baggage, said you aught of Lanciotto? Rit. No, not a word; and he 's so ugly, too! Gui. Is he so ugly? Rit. Ugly! he is worse Than Pilate on the hangings. Gui. Hold your tongue Here, and at Rimini, about the Count, And you shall prosper. Rit. Am I not to boil? Gui. No, child. But be discreet at Rimini. Old Malatesta is a dreadful manâ Far worse than Iâhe bakes his people, Ritta; Lards them, like geese, and bakes them in an oven. Rit. Fire is my fate, I see that. Gui. Have a care It do not follow you beyond this world. Where is your mistress? Rit. In her room, my lord. After I told her of the Count Paolo, She flew to have an interview with you; But on the wayâI know not why it wasâ She darted to her chamber, and there stays Weeping in silence. It would do you goodâ More than a hundred sermonsâjust to see A single tear, indeed it would, my lord. Gui. Ha! you are saucy. I have humored you Past prudence, malpert! Get you to your room! [Exit Ritta.] More of my blood runs in yon damsel's veins Than the world knows. Her mother to a shade; The same high spirit, and strange martyr-wish To sacrifice herself, body and soul, For some loved end. All that she did for me; And yet I loved her not. O! memory! The darkest future has a ray of hope, But thou art blacker than the sepulchre! Thy horrid shapes lie round, like scattered bones, Hopeless forever! I am sick at heart. The past crowds on the present: as I sowed, So am I reaping. Shadows from myself Fall on the picture, as I trace anew These rising spectres of my early life, And add their gloom to what was dark before. O! memory, memory! How my temples throb! [Sits.] (Enter Francesca, hastily.) Francesca. My lord, this outrageâ(He looks up.) Father are you ill? You seem unhappy. Have I troubled you? You heard how passionate and bad I was, When Ritta told me of the Count Paolo. Dear father, calm yourself; and let me ask A child's forgiveness. 'T was undutiful To doubt your wisdom. It is over now. I only thought you might have trusted me With any counsel. Gui. (Aside.) Would I had! Fran. Ah! well, I understand it all, and you were right. Only the danger of it. Think, my lord, If I had loved this man at the first sight: We all have heard of such things. Think, again, If I had loved himâas I then supposed You wished me toâ't would have been very sad. But no, dear sir, I kept my heart secure, Nor will I loose it till you give the word. I 'm wiser than you thought me, you perceive. But when we saw him, face to face, together, Surely you might have told me then. Gui. Francesca, My eyes are oldâI did not clearly seeâ Faith, it escaped my thoughts. Some other things Came in my head. I was as ignorant Of Count Paolo's coming as yourself. The brothers are so like. Fran. Indeed? Gui. Yes, yes. One is the other's counterpart, in fact; And even now it may not beâO! shame! I lie by habit. [Aside.] Fran. Then there is a hope? He may be Lanciotto, after all? O! joyâ (Enter a Servant.) Servant. The Count Paolo. [Exit.] Fran. Misery! That name was not Lanciotto! Gui. Farewell, child. I'll leave you with the Count: he'll make it plain. It seems 't was Count Paolo. [Going.] Fran. Father! Gui. Well. Fran. You knew it from the first! (Exit Guido.) Let me begone: I could not look him in the face again With the old faith. Besides, 't would anger him To have a living witness of his fraud Ever before him; and I could not trustâ Strive as I mightâmy happiness to him, As once I did. I could not lay my hand Upon his shoulder, and look up to him, Saying, Dear father, pilot me along Past this dread rock, through yonder narrow strait. Saints, no! The gold that gave my life away Might, even then, be rattling in his purse, Warm from the buyer's hand. Look on me, Heaven! Him thou didst sanctify before my eyes, Him thou didst charge, as thy great deputy, With guardianship of a weak orphan girl, Has fallen from grace, has paltered with his trust; I have no mother to receive thy charge,â O! take it on thyself; and when I err, Through mortal blindness, Heaven, be thou my guide! Worse cannot fall me. Though my husband lack A parent's tenderness, he yet may have Faith, truth, and honorâthe immortal bonds That knit together honest hearts as one. Let me away to Rimini. Alas! It wrings my heart to have outlived the day That I can leave my home with no regret! [Weeps.] (Enter Paolo.) Paolo. Pray, pardon me. [Going.] Fran. You are quite welcome, Count A foolish tear, a weakness, nothing more: But present weeping clears our future sight. They tell me you are love's commissioner, A kind of broker in the trade of hearts: Is it your usual business? or may I Flatter myself, by claiming this essay As your first effort? Paolo. Lady, I believed My post, at starting, one of weight and trust; When I beheld you, I concluded it A charge of honor and high dignity. I did not think to hear you underrate Your own importance, by dishonoring me. Fran. You are severe, my lord. Paolo. No, not severe; Say candid, rather. I am somewhat hurt By my reception. If I feel the wound, 'T is not because I suffer from the jest, But that your lips should deal it. Fran. Compliments Appear to be the staple of your speech. You ravish one with courtesy, you pour Fine words upon one, till the listening head Is bowed with sweetness. Sir, your talk is drugged; There 's secret poppy in your sugared phrase: I'll taste before I take it. Paolo. Gentle ladyâ Fran. I am not gentle, or I missed my aim. I am no hawk to fly at every lure. You courtly gentlemen draw one broad ruleâ All girls are fools. It may be so, in truth, Yet so I'll not be treated. Paolo. Have you been? If I implied such slander by my words, They wrong my purpose. If I compliment, 'T is not from habit, but because I thought Your face deserved my homage as its due. When I have clearer insight, and you spread Your inner nature o'er your lineaments, Even that face may darken in the shades Of my opinion. For mere loveliness Needs inward light to keep it always bright. All things look badly to unfriendly eyes. I spoke my first impression; cooler thought May work strange changes. Fran. Ah! Sir Count, at length There 's matter in your words. Paolo. Unpleasant stuff, To judge by your dark brows. I have essayed Kindness and coldness, yet you are not pleased. Fran. How can I be? Paolo. How, lady? Fran. Ay, sir, how? Your brotherâmy good lord that is to beâ Stings me with his neglect; and in the place He should have filled, he sends a go-between, A common carrier of others' love; How can the sender, or the person sent, Please overmuch? Now, were I such as you, I 'd be too proud to travel round the land With other peoples' feelings in my heart; Even to fill the void which you confess By such employment. Paolo. Lady, 't is your wish To nettle me, to break my breeding down, And see what natural passions I have hidden Behind the outworks of my etiquette. I neither own nor feel the want of heart With which you charge me. You are more than cruel; You rouse my nerves until they ache with life, And then pour fire upon them. For myself I would not speak, unless you had compelled. My task is odious to me. Since I came, Heaven bear me witness how my traitor heart Has fought against my duty; and how oft I wished myself in Lanciotto's place, Or him in mine. Fran. You riddle. Paolo. Do I? Well, Let it remain unguessed. Fran. You wished yourself At Rimini, or Lanciotto here? You may have reasons. Paolo. Well interpreted! The Sphinx were simple in your skilful hands! Fran. It has become your turn to sneer. Paolo. But I Have gall to feed my bitterness, while you Jest in the wanton ease of happiness. Stop! there is peril in our talk. Fran. As how? Paolo. 'T is dangerous to talk about one's self; It panders selfishness. My duty waits. Fran. My future lord's affairs? I quite forgot Count Lanciotto. Paolo. I, too, shame upon me! [Aside.] Fran. Does he resemble you? Paolo. Pray drop me, lady. Fran. Nay, answer me. Paolo. Somewhatâin feature. Fran. Ha! Is he so fair? Paolo. No, darker. He was tanned In long campaigns, and battles hotly fought, While I lounged idly with the troubadours, Under the shadow of his watchful sword. Fran. In person? Paolo. He is shorter, I believe, But broader, stronger, more compactly knit. Fran. What of his mind? Paolo. Ah! now you strike the key! A mind just fitted to his history, An equal balance 'twixt desert and fame. No future chronicler shall say of him, His fame outran his merit; or his merit Halted behind some adverse circumstance, And never won the glory it deserved. My love might weary you, if I rehearsed The simple beauty of his character; His grandeur and his gentleness of heart, His warlike fire and peaceful love, his faith, His courtesy, his truth. I'll not deny Some human weakness, to attract our love, Harbors in him, as in the rest of us. Sometimes against our city's enemies He thunders in the distance, and devotes Their homes to ruin. When the brand has fallen, He ever follows with a healing rain, And in his pity shoulders by revenge. A thorough soldier, lady. He grasps crowns, While I pick at the laurel. Fran. Stay, my lord! I asked your brother's value, with no wish To hear you underrate yourself. Your worth May rise in passing through another's lips. Lanciotto is perfection, then? Paolo. To me: Others may think my brother over-nice Upon the point of honor; over-keen To take offence where no offence is meant; A thought too prodigal of human life, Holding it naught when weighed against a wrong; Suspicious of the motives of his friends; Distrustful of his own high excellence; And with a certain gloom of temperament, When thus disturbed, that makes him terrible And rash in action. I have heard of this; I never felt it. I distress you, lady? Perhaps I throw these points too much in shade, By catching at an enemy's report. But, then, Lanciotto said, âYou'll speak of me, Not as I ought to be, but as I am.â He loathes deceit. Fran. That 's noble! Have you done? I have observed a strange reserve, at times, An over-carefulness in choosing words, Both in my father and his nearest friends, When speaking of your brother; as if they Picked their way slowly over rocky ground, Fearing to stumble. Ritta, too, my maid, When her tongue rattles on in full career, Stops at your brother's name, and with a sigh Settles herself to dismal silence. Count, These things have troubled me. From you I look For perfect frankness. Is there naught withheld? Paolo. (Aside.) O, base temptation! What if I betray His crippled personâimitate his limpâ Laugh at his hip, his back, his sullen moods Of childish superstition?âtread his heart Under my feet, to climb into his place?â Use his own warrant 'gainst himself; and say, Because I loved her, and misjudged your jest, Therefore I stole her? Why, a common thief Would hang for just such thinking! Ha! ha! ha! [Laughing.] I reckon on her love, as if I held The counsels of her bosom. No, I swear, Francesca would despise so mean a deed. Have I no honor either? Are my thoughts All bound by her opinion? Fran. This is strange! Is Lanciotto's name a spell to all? I ask a simple question, and straight you Start to one side, and mutter to yourself, And laugh, and groan, and play the lunatic, In such a style that you astound me more Than all the others. It appears to me I have been singled as a common dupe By every one. What mystery is this Surrounds Count Lanciotto? If there be A single creature in the universe Who has a right to know him as he is, I am that one. Paolo. I grant it. You shall see, And shape your judgment by your own remark. All that my honor calls for I have said. Fran. I am content. Unless I greatly err, Heaven made your breast the seat of honest thoughts. You know, my lord, that, once at Rimini, There can be no retreat for me. By you, Here at Ravenna, in your brother's name, I shall be solemnly betrothed. And now I thus extend my maiden hand to you; If you are conscious of no secret guilt, Take it. Paolo. I do. [Takes her hand.] Fran. You tremble! Paolo. With the hand, Not with the obligation. Fran. Farewell, Count! 'T were cruel to tax your stock of compliments, That waste their sweets upon a trammelled heart; Go fly your fancies at some freer game. [Exit.] Paolo. O, heaven, if I have faltered and am weak, 'T is from my nature! Fancies, more accursed Than haunt a murderer's bedside, throng my brainâ Temptations, such as mortal never bore Since Satan whispered in the ear of Eve, Sing in my earâand all, all are accursed! At heart I have betrayed my brother's trust, Francesca's openly. Turn where I will, As if enclosed within a mirrored hall, I see a traitor. Now to stand erect, Firm on my base of manly constancy; Or, if I stagger, let me never quit The homely path of duty, for the ways That bloom and glitter with seductive sin! [Exit.] ACT III. SCENE I. Rimini. A Room in the Castle. Lanciotto discovered reading. Lanciotto. O! fie, philosophy! This Seneca Revels in wealth, and whines about the poor! Talks of starvation while his banquet waits, And fancies that a two hours' appetite Throws light on famine! Doubtless he can tell, As he skips nimbly through his dancing-girls, How sad it is to limp about the world A sightless cripple! Let him feel the crutch Wearing against his heart, and then I 'd hear This sage talk glibly; or provide a pad, Stuffed with his soft philosophy, to ease His aching shoulder. Pshaw! he never felt, Or pain would choke his frothy utterance. 'T is easy for the doctor to compound His nauseous simples for a sick man's health; But let him swallow them, for his disease, Without wry faces. Ah! the tug is there. Show me philosophy in rags, in want, Sick of a fever, with a back like mine, Creeping to wisdom on these legs, and I Will drink its comforts. Out! away with you! There 's no such thing as real philosophy! [Throws down the book.] (Enter Pepe.) Here is a sage who'll teach a courtier The laws of etiquette, a statesman rule, A soldier discipline, a poet verse, And each mechanic his distinctive trade; Yet bring him to his motley, and how wide He shoots from reason! We can understand All business but our own, and thrust advice In every gaping cranny of the world; While habit shapes us to our own dull work, And reason nods above his proper task. Just so philosophy would rectify All things abroad, and be a jade at home. Pepe, what think you of the Emperor's aim Towards Hungary? Pepe. A most unwise design; For mark, my lordâ Lan. Why, there! the fact cries out. Here 's motley thinking for a diadem!â Ay, and more wisely in his own regard. Pepe. You flout me, cousin. Lan. Have you aught that 's new?â Some witty trifle, some absurd conceit? Pepe. Troth, no. Lan. Why not give up the Emperor, And bend your wisdom on your duties, Pepe? Pepe. Because the Emperor has more need of wisdom Than the most barren fool of wit. Lan. Well said! Mere habit brings the fool back to his art. This jester is a rare philosopher. Teach me philosophy, good fool. Pepe. No need. You'll get a teacher when you take a wife. If she do not instruct you in more arts Than Aristotle ever thought upon, The good old race of woman has declined Into a sort of male stupidity. I had a sweetheart once, she lectured grandly; No matter on what subject she might hit, 'T was all the same, she could talk and she would. She had no silly modesty; she dashed Straight in the teeth of any argument, And talked you deaf, dumb, blind. Whatever struck Upon her ear, by some machinery, Set her tongue wagging. Thank the Lord, she died!â Dropped in the middle of a fierce harangue, Like a spent horse. It was an even thing, Whether she talked herself or me to death. The latest sign of life was in her tongue; It wagged till sundown, like a serpent's tail, Long after all the rest of her was cold. Alas! poor Zippa! Lan. Were you married, fool? Pepe. Married! Have I the scars upon me? No; I fell in love; and that was bad enough, And far enough for a mere fool to go. Married! why, marriage is love's purgatory, Without a heaven beyond. Lan. Fie, atheist! Would you abolish marriage? Pepe. Yes. Lan. What? Pepe. Yes. Lan. Depopulate the world? Pepe. No fear of that. I 'd have no families, no Malatesti, Strutting about the land, with pedigrees And claims bequeathed them by their ancestors; No fellows vaporing of their royal blood; No one to seize a whole inheritance, And rob the other children of the earth. By Jove! you should not know your fathers, even! I 'd have you spring, like toadstools, from the soilâ Mere sons of womenânothing more nor lessâ All base-born, and all equal. There, my lord, There is a simple commonwealth for you! In which aspiring merit takes the lead, And birth goes begging. Lan. It is so, in truth; And by the simplest means I ever heard. Pepe. Think of it, cousin. Tell it to your friends, The statesmen, soldiers, and philosophers; Noise it about the earth, and let it stir The sluggish spirits of the multitudes. Pursue the thought, scan it, from end to end, Through all its latent possibilities. It is a great seed dropped, I promise you, And it must sprout. Thought never wholly dies; It only wants a nameâa hard Greek nameâ Some few apostles, who may live on itâ A crowd of listeners, with the average dulness That man possessesâand we organize; Spread our new doctrine, like a general plague; Talk of man's progress and development, Wrongs of society, the march of mind, The Devil, Doctor Faustus, and what not; And, lo! this pretty world turns upside down, All with a fool's idea! Lan. By Jupiter, You hit our modern teachers to a hair! I knew this fool was a philosopher. Pepe is right. Mechanic means advance; Nature bows down to science' haughty tread, And turns the wheel of smutty artifice; New governments arise, dilate, decay, And foster creeds and churches to their tastes: At each advance, we cry, âBehold, the end!â Till some fresh wonder breaks upon the age. But man, the moral creature, midst it all Stands still unchanged; nor moves towards virtue more, Nor comprehends the mysteries in himself, More than when Plato taught academies, Or Zeno thundered from his Attic porch. Pepe. I know not that; I only want my scheme Tried for a while. I am a politician, A wrongs-of-man man. Hang philosophy! Let metaphysics swallow, at a gulp, Its last two syllables, and purge itself Clean of its filthy humors! I am one Ready for martyrdom, for stake and fire, If I can make my great idea take root! Zounds! cousin, if I had an audience, I 'd make you shudder at my eloquence! I have an itching to reform the world. Lan. Begin at home, then. Pepe. Home is not my sphere; Heaven picked me out to teach my fellow-men. I am a very firebrand of truthâ A self-consuming, doomed, devoted brandâ That burn to ashes while I light the world! I feel it in me. I am moved, inspired, Stirred into utterance, by some mystic power Of which I am the humble instrument. Lan. A bad digestion, sage, a bilious turn, A gnawing stomach, or a pinching shoe. Pepe. O! hear, but spare the scoffer! Spare the wretch Who sneers at the anointed man of truth! When we reached that, I and my followers Would rend you limb from limb. There!âha! ha! ha! [Laughing.] Have I not caught the slang these fellows preach; A grand, original idea, to back it; And all the stock in trade of a reformer? Lan. You have indeed; nor do I wonder, Pepe. Fool as you are, I promise you success In your new calling, if you'll set it up. The thing is far too simple. [Trumpet sounds within.] Pepe. Hist! my lord. Lan. That calls me to myself. Pepe. At that alarm, All Rimini leaped up upon its feet. Cousin, your bridal-train. You groan! 'Ods wounds! Here is the bridegroom sorely malcontentâ The sole sad face in Rimini. Since morn, A quiet man could hardly walk the streets, For flowers and streamers. All the town is gay. Perhaps 't is merry o'er your misery. Lan. Perhaps; but that it knows not. Pepe. Yes, it does: It knows that when a man 's about to wed, He 's ripe to laugh at. Cousin, tell me, now, Why is Paolo on the way so long? Ravenna 's but eight leagues from Riminiâ Lan. That 's just the measure of your tongue, good fool. You trouble me. I 've had enough of youâ Begone! Pepe. I 'm going; but you see I limp. Have pity on a cripple, gentle Count. [Limps.] Lan. Pepe! Pepe. A miracle, a miracle! See, see, my lord, at Pepe's saintly name The lame jog on. Malatesta. (Without.) Come, Lanciotto! Lan. Hark! My father calls. Pepe. If he were mine, I 'd goâ That 's a good boy! [Pats Lanciotto's back.] Lan. (Starting.) Hands off! you'll rue it else! [Exit.] Pepe. (Laughing.) Ha! ha! I laid my hand upon his hump! Heavens, how he squirmed! And what a wish I had To cry, Ho! camel! leap upon his back, And ride him to the devil! So, we 've had A pleasant flitting round philosophy! The Count and Fool bumped heads, and struck ideas Out by the contact! Quite a pleasant talkâ A friendly conversation, nothing moreâ 'Twixt nobleman and jester. Ho! my bird, I can toss lures as high as any man. So, I amuse you with my harmless wit? Pepe 's your friend nowâyou can trust in himâ An honest, simple fool! Just try it once, You ugly, misbegotten clod of dirt! Ay, but the humpâthe touch upon the humpâ The start and wriggleâthat was rare! Ha! ha! [Exit, laughing.] SCENE II. The Same. The Grand Square before the Castle. Soldiers on guard, with banners, &amp;c. Citizens, in holiday dresses, cross the scene. The houses are hung with trophies, banners, garlands, &amp;c. Enter Malatesta, with guards, attendants, &amp;c. Malatesta. Captain, take care the streets be not choked up By the rude rabble. Send to CÃ¦sar's bridge A strong detachment of your men, and clear The way before them. See that nothing check The bride's first entrance into Rimini. Station your veterans in the front. Count Guido Comes with his daughter, and his eyes are sharp. Keep up a show of strength before him, sir; And set some laborers to work upon The broken bastion. Make all things look bright; As if we stood in eager readiness, And high condition, to begin a war. Captain. I will, my lord. Mal. Keep Guido in your eye; And if you see him looking over-long On any weakness of our walls, just file Your bulkiest fellows round him; or get up A scuffle with the people; anythingâ Even if you break a head or twoâto draw His vision off. But where our strength is great, Take heed to make him see it. You conceive? Capt. Trust me, my lord. [Exit with guards.] (Enter Pepe.) Pepe. Room, room! A hall, a hall! I pray you, good man, has the funeral passed? Mal. Who is it asks? Pepe. Pepe of Padua, A learned doctor of uncivil law. Mal. But how a funeral? Pepe. You are weak of wit. Francesca of Ravenna 's borne to church, And never issues thence. Mal. How, doctor, pray? Pepe. Now, for a citizen of Rimini, You 're sadly dull. Does she not issue thence Fanny of Rimini? A glorious change,â A kind of resurrection in the flesh! Mal. (Laughing.) Ha! ha! thou cunning villain! I was caught. I own it, doctor. Pepe. (Aside.) This old fool would laugh To see me break a straw, because the bits Were of unequal lengths. My character Carries more dulness, in the guise of wit, Than would suffice to break an ass's back. (Distant shouts, music, &amp;c.) Hark! here comes Jeptha's daughter, jogging on With timbrels and with dances. Mal. Jeptha's daughter! How so? Pepe. Her father's sacrifice. Mal. (Laughing.) Ho! ho! You'll burst my belt! O! you outrageous wretch, To jest at Scripture! Pepe. You outlandish heathen, 'T is not in Scripture! Mal. Is it not? Pepe. No more Than you are in heaven. Mere Hebrew history. She went up to the mountains, to bewail The too-long keeping of her honesty. There 's woman for you! there 's a character! What man would ever think of such a thing? Ah! we of Rimini have little cause For such a sorrow. Would she 'd been my wife! I'll marry any woman in her case. Mal. Why, Pepe? Pepe. Why? because, in two months' time, Along comes father Jeptha with his knife, And there 's an end. Where is your sacrifice? Where 's Isaac, Abraham? Build your altar up: One pile will do for both. Mal. That 's Scripture, sure. Pepe. Then I'm a ram, and you may slaughter me In Isaac's stead. Mal. Here comes the vanguard. Where, Where is that laggard? Pepe. At the mirror, uncle, Making himself look beautiful. He comes, [Looking out.] Fresh as a bridegroom! Mark his doublet's fit Across the shoulders, and his hose!â By Jove, he nearly looks like any other man! Mal. You 'd best not let him hear you. Sirrah, knave, I have a mind to swinge you! [Seizes his ear.] Pepe. Loose my ear! You 've got the wrong sow, swineherd! You 're unjust. Being his father, I was fool sufficient To think you fashioned him to suit yourself, By way of a variety. The thought Was good enough, the practice damnable. Mal. Hush! or I'll clap you in the pillory. (Enter Lanciotto.) Pepe. (Sings.) Ho, ho, ho, ho!âold Time has wingsâ We 're born, we mourn, we wed, we bed, We have a devilish aching head; So down we lie, And die, and fry; And there 's a merry end of things! (Music, &amp;c., within.) Here come Ravenna's eagles for a roost In Rimini! The air is black with them. When go they hence? Wherever yon bird builds, The nest remains for ages. Have an eye, Or Malatesta's elephant may feel The eagle's talons. Lanciotto. You 're a raven, croaker. Pepe. And you no white crow, to insure us luck. Mal. There 's matter in his croak. Pepe. There always is; But men lack ears. Mal. Then eyes must do our work. Old Guido shall be looked to. If his force Appear too great, I'll camp him out of town. Lan. Father, you are a sorry host. Mal. Well, well, I 'm a good landlord, though. I do not like This flight of eagles more than Pepe. 'Sdeath! Guido was ever treacherous. Lan. My lord, You mar my holiday by such a thought. My holiday! Dear saints! it seems to me That all of you are mocking me. Pepe. Soâsoâ Guido was ever treacherous?âsoâso! Mal. Soâso! How so? Pepe. What if this treachery Run in the blood? We'll tap a vein thenâso! Mal. Sew up your mouth, and mind your fooling, fool! Pepe. Am I not fooling? Why, my lord, I thought The fooling exquisite. Lan. (Aside.) This thoughtless knave Hits near us sometimes with his random shafts. Marriage for me! I cannot comprehend, I cannot take it to my heart; the thing Seems gross, absurd, ridiculous. Ah! well, My father bears the folly of it all; I 'm but an actor in his comedy. My part is bad, but I must through with it. [Retires.] (Shouts, music, &amp;c., within.) Pepe. Look! here 's the whole parade! Mark yonder knaveâ The head one with the standard. Nature, nature! Hadst thou a hand in such a botch-work? Why, A forest of his legs would scarcely make A bunch of fagots. Mark old Guido, too! He looks like Judas with his silver. Ho! Here 's news from sweet Ravenna! Mal. (Laughing.) Ha! ha! ha! Pepe. Ah! now the bride!âthat 's somethingâshe is toothsome. Look you, my lordânow, while the progress haltsâ Cousin Paolo, has he got the dumps? Mercy! to see him, one might almost think 'T was his own marriage. What a doleful face! The boy is ill. He caught a fever, uncle, Travelling across the marshes. Physic! physic! If he be really dying, get a doctor, And cut the matter short. 'T were merciful. Mal. For heaven's sake, cease your clamor! I shall have No face to meet them else. 'T is strange, for all: What ails Paolo? Pepe. Dying, by this hand! Mal. Then I will hang you. Pepe. Don't take up my craft. Wit 's such a stranger in your brain that I Scarce knew my lodger venturing from your mouth. Now they come on again. Mal. Stand back! Pepe. (Looking round.) The bridegroom? He flies betimes, before the bride shows fight. [Walks back, looking for Lanciotto.] (Music, shouts, ringing of bells, &amp;c. Enter Men-at-arms, with banners, &amp;c., Guido, Cardinal, Knights, Attendants, &amp;c.; then Paolo, conducting Francesca, followed by Ritta, Ladies, Pages, &amp;c., and other Men-at-arms. They file around the stage, and halt.) Mal. Welcome, to Rimini, Count Guido! Welcome, And fair impressions of our poor abode, To you, my daughter! You are well returned, My son, Paolo! Let me bless you, son. [Paolo approaches.] How many spears are in old Guido's train? [Apart to Paolo.] Paolo. Some ten-score. Mal. Footmen? Paolo. Double that. Mal. 'T is well. Again I bid you welcome! Make no show Of useless ceremony with us. Friends Have closer titles than the empty name. We have provided entertainment, Count, For all your followers, in the midst of us. We trust the veterans of Rimini May prove your soldiers that our courtesy Does not lag far behind their warlike zeal. Let us drop Guelf and Ghibelin henceforth, Coupling the names of Rimini and Ravenna As bridegroom's to his bride's. Guido. Count Malatesta, I am no rhetorician, or my words Might keep more even with the love I feel: Simply, I thank you. With an honest hand I take the hand which you extend to me, And hope our grasp may never lose its warmth.â You marked the bastion by the water-side? Weak as a bulrush. [Apart to a Knight.] Knight. Tottering weak, my lord. Gui. Remember it; and when you 're private, sir, Draw me a plan. Knight. I will, my lord. Gui. How 's this? I do not see my future son-in-law. Mal. Lanciotto! Lan. (Advancing.) I am here, my lord. Francesca. (Starting.) O! heaven! Is that my husband, Count Paolo? You, You then, among the rest, have played me false! He isâ[Apart to Paolo.] Paolo. My brother. Lan. (Aside.) Ha! she turns from me. Pepe. (Approaching Lanciotto, sings.) Around, around the lady turned, She turned not to her lord; She turned around to a gallant, gallant knight, Who ate at his father's board. A pretty ballad! all on one string though. Lan. Pepe, go hence! (Pepe retires.) (Aside.) I saw her start and pale, Turn off with horror; as if she had seenâ What?âsimply me. For, am I not enough, And something over, to make ladies quail, Start, hide their faces, whisper to their friends, Point at meâdare she?âand perform such tricks As women will when monsters blast their sight? O! saints above me, have I come so low? Yon damsel of Ravenna shall bewail That start and shudder. I am mad, mad, mad! I must be patient. They have trifled with her: Lied to her, lied! There 's half the misery Of this broad earth, all crowded in one word. Lied, lied!âWho has not suffered from a lie? They 're all aghastâall looking at me too. Francesca 's whiter than the brow of fear: Paolo talks.âBrother, is that well meant? What if I draw my sword, and fight my way Out of this cursed town? 'T would be relief. Has shame no hiding-place? I 've touched the depth Of human infamy, and there I rest. By heaven, I'll brave this business out! Shall they Say at Ravenna that Count Lanciotto, Who 's driven their shivering squadrons to their homes, Haggard with terror, turned before their eyes And slunk away? They'll look me from the field, When we encounter next. Why should not I Strut with my shapeless body, as old Guido Struts with his shapeless heart? I'll do it! (Offers, but shrinks back.) 'Sdeath! Am I so false as to forswear myself? Lady Francesca! [Approaches Francesca.] Fran. Sirâmy lordâ Lan. Dear lady, I have a share in your embarrassment, And know the feelings that possess you now. Fran. O! you do not. Paolo. (Advancing.) My ladyâ Lan. Gentle brother, Leave this to me. [Paolo retires.] Fran. Pray do not send him off. Lan. 'T is fitter so. Fran. He comforts me. Lan. Indeed? Do you need comfort? Fran. No, noâpardon me! But thenâhe isâyou areâ Lan. Take breath, and speak. Fran. I am confused, 't is true. But, then, my lord, You are a stranger to me; and Paolo I 've known so long! Lan. Since yesterday. Fran. Ah! well: But the relationship between us two Is of so close a nature, while the knowledge, That each may have of each, so slender is That the two jar. Besides, Paolo is Nothing to me, while you are everything. Can I not act? [Aside.] Lan. I scarcely understand. You say your knowledge of me, till to-day, Was incomplete. Has naught been said of me By Count Paolo or your father? Fran. Yes; But nothing definite. Lan. Perchance, no hint As to my ways, my feelings, manners, orâ Orâorâas I was sayingâha! ha!âorâ [Laughing.] As to my person? Fran. Nothing, as to that. Lan. To what? Fran. Yourâperson. Lan. That 's the least of all. [Turns aside.] Now, had I Guido of Ravenna's head Under this heel, I 'd grind it into dust! False villain, to betray his simple child! And thou, Paoloânot a whit behindâ Helping his craft with inconsiderate love!â Lady Francesca, when my brother left, I charged him, as he loved me, to conceal Nothing from you that bore on me: and now That you have seen me, and conversed with me, If you object to anything in me,â Go, I release you. Fran. But Ravenna's peace? Lan. Shall not be perilled. Gui. (Coming behind, whispers her.) Trust him not, my child; I know his ways; he 'd rather fight than wed. 'T is but a wish to have the war afoot. Stand firm for poor Ravenna! Lan. Well, my lady, Shall we conclude a lasting peace between us By truce or marriage rites? Gui. (Whispers her.) The devil tempts thee: Think of Ravenna, think of me! Lan. My lord, I see my father waits you. [Guido retires.] Fran. Gentle sir, You do me little honor in the choice. Lan. My aim is justice. Fran. Would you cast me off? Lan. Not for the world, if honestly obtained; Not for the world would I obtain you falsely. Fran. The rites were half concluded ere we met. Lan. Meeting, would you withdraw? Fran. No. Bitter word! [Aside.] Lan. No! Are you dealing fairly? Fran. I have said. Lan. O! rapture, rapture! Can it be that Iâ Now I'll speak plainly; for a choice like thine Implies such love as woman never felt. Love me! Then monsters beget miracles, And Heaven provides where human means fall short. Lady, I'll worship thee! I'll line thy path With suppliant kings! Thy waiting-maids shall be Unransomed princesses! Mankind shall bow One neck to thee, as Persia's multitudes Before the rising sun! From this small town, This centre of my conquests, I will spread An empire touching the extremes of earth! I'll raise once more the name of ancient Rome; And what she swayed she shall reclaim again! If I grow mad because you smile on me, Think of the glory of thy love; and know How hard it is, for such a one as I, To gaze unshaken on divinity! There 's no such love as mine alive in man. From every corner of the frowning earth, It has been crowded back into my heart. Now, take it all! If that be not enough, Ask, and thy wish shall be omnipotent! Your hand. (Takes her hand.) It wavers. Fran. So does not my heart. Lan. Brave! Thou art every way a soldier's wife; Thou shouldst have been a CÃ¦sar's! Father, hark! I blamed your judgment, only to perceive The weakness of my own. Mal. What means all this? Lan. It means that this fair ladyâthough I gave Release to her, and to Ravennaâplaced The liberal hand, which I restored to her, Back in my own, of her own free good-will. Is it not wonderful? Mal. How so? Lan. How so! Paolo. Alas! 'tis as I feared! [Aside.] Mal. You 're humble?âHow? Lan. Now shall I cry aloud to all the world, Make my deformity my pride, and say, Because she loves me, I may boast of it? [Aside.] No matter, father, I am happy; you, As the blessed cause, shall share my happiness. Let us be moving. Revels, dashed with wine, Shall multiply the joys of this sweet day! There 's not a blessing in the cup of life I have not tasted of within an hour! Fran. (Aside.) Thus I begin the practice of deceit, Taught by deceivers, at a fearful cost. The bankrupt gambler has become the cheat, And lives by arts that erewhile ruined me. Where it will end, Heaven knows; but Iâ I have betrayed the noblest heart of all! Lan. Draw down thy dusky vapors, sullen nightâ Refuse, ye stars, to shine upon the worldâ Let everlasting blackness wrap the sun, And whisper terror to the universe! We need ye not! we'll blind ye, if ye dare Peer with lack-lustre on our revelry! I have at heart a passion, that would make All nature blaze with recreated light! [Exeunt.] ACT IV. SCENE I. The Same. An Apartment in the Castle. Enter Lanciotto. Lanciotto. It cannot be that I have duped myself, That my desire has played into the hand Of my belief; yet such a thing might be. We palm more frauds upon our simple selves Than knavery puts upon us. Could I trust The open candor of an angel's brow, I must believe Francesca's. But the tongue Should consummate the proof upon the brow, And give the truth its word. The fault lies there. I 've tried her. Press her as I may to it, She will not utter those three little wordsâ âI love thee.â She will say, âI'll marry you;â I'll be your duteous wife;âI'll cheer your days;â I'll do whate'er I can.â But at the point Of present love, she ever shifts the ground, Winds round the word, laughs, calls me âInfidel!â How can I doubt?â So, on and on. But yet, For all her dainty ways, she never says, Frankly, I love thee. I am jealousâtrue! Suspiciousâtrue! distrustful of myself;â She knows all that. Ay, and she likewise knows, A single waking of her morning breath Would blow these vapors off. I would not take The barren offer of a heartless hand, If all the Indies cowered under it. Perhaps she loves another? No; she said, âI love you, Count, as well as any man;â And laughed, as if she thought that precious wit. I turn her nonsense into argument, And think I reason. Shall I give her up? Rail at her heartlessness, and bid her go Back to Ravenna? But she clings to me, At the least hint of parting. Ah! 't is sweet, Sweeter than slumber to the lids of pain, To fancy that a shadow of true love May fall on this God-stricken mould of woe, From so serene a nature. Beautiful Is the first vision of a desert brook, Shining beneath its palmy garniture, To one who travels on his easy way; What is it to the blood-shot, aching eye Of some poor wight who crawls with gory feet, In famished madness, to its very brink; And throws his sun-scorched limbs upon the cool And humid margin of its shady strand, To suck up life at every eager gasp? Such seems Francesca to my thirsting soul; Shall I turn off and die? (Enter Pepe.) Pepe. Good-morning, cousin! Lan. Good-morning to your foolish majesty! Pepe. The same to your majestic foolery! Lan. You compliment! Pepe. I am a troubadour, A ballad-monger of fine mongrel ballads, And therefore running o'er with elegance. Wilt hear my verse? Lan. With patience? Pepe. No, with rapture. You must go madâweep, rend your clothes, and roll Over and over, like the ancient Greeks, When listening to Iliad. Lan. Sing, then, sing! And if you equal Homer in your song, Why, roll I must, by sheer compulsion. Pepe. Nay, You lack the temper of the fine-eared Greek. You will not roll; but that shall not disgrace My gallant ballad, fallen on evil times. [Sings.] My father had a blue-black head, My uncle's head was reddishâmaybe, My mother's hair was noways red, Sing high ho! the pretty baby! Mark the simplicity of that! 'T is called âThe Babe's Confession,â spoken just before His father strangled him. Lan. Most marvellous! You struggle with a legend worth your art. Pepe. Now to the second stanza. Note the hint I drop about the baby's parentage: So delicately too! A maid might sing, And never blush at it. Girls love these songs Of sugared wickedness. They'll go miles about, To say a foul thing in a cleanly way. A decent immorality, my lord, Is art's specific. Get the passions up, But never wring the stomach. Lan. Triumphant art! Pepe. (Sings.) My father combed his blue-black head, My uncle combed his red headâmaybe, My mother combed my head, and said, Sing high ho! my red-haired baby! Lan. Fie, fie! go comb your hair in private. Pepe. What! Will you not hear? Now comes the tragedy. [Sings.] My father tore my red, red head, My uncle tore my father'sâmaybe, My mother tore both till they bledâ Sing high ho! your brother's baby! Lan. Why, what a hair-rending! Pepe. Thence wigs arose; A striking epoch in man's history. But did you notice the concluding line, Sung by the victim's mother? There 's a hit! âSing high ho! your brother's baby!â Which brother's, pray you? That 's the mystery, The adumbration of poetic art, And there I leave it to perplex mankind. It has a moral, fathers should regard,â A black-haired dog breeds not a red-haired cur. Treasure this knowledge: you 're about to wive; And no one knows what accidentâ Lan. Peace, fool! So all this cunning thing was wound about, To cast a jibe at my deformity? [Tears off Pepe's cap.] There lies your cap, the emblem that protects Your head from chastisement. Now, Pepe, hark! Of late you 've taken to reviling me; Under your motley, you have dared to jest At God's inflictions. Let me tell you, fool, No man e'er lived, to make a second jest At me, before your time! Pepe. Boo! bloody-bones! If you 're a cowardâwhich I hardly thinkâ You'll have me flogged, or put into a cell, Or fed to wolves. If you are bold of heart, You'll let me run. Do not; I'll work you harm! I, Beppo Pepe, standing as a man, Without my motley, tell you, in plain terms, I'll work you harmâI'll do you mischief, man! Lan. I, Lanciotto, Count of Rimini, Will hang you, then. Put on your jingling cap; You please my father. But remember, fool, No jests at me! Pepe. I will try earnest next. Lan. And I the gallows. Pepe. Well, cry quits, cry quits! I'll stretch your heart, and you my neckâquits, quits! Lan. Go, fool! Your weakness bounds your malice. Pepe. Yes: So you all think, you savage gentlemen, Until you feel my sting. Hang, hang away! It is an airy, wholesome sort of death, Much to my liking. When I hang, my friend, You'll be chief mourner, I can promise you. Hang me! I 've quite a notion to be hung: I'll do my utmost to deserve it.âHang! [Exit.] Lan. I am bemocked on all sides. My sad state Has given the licensed and unlicensed fool Charter to challenge me at every turn. The jester's laughing bauble blunts my sword, His gibes cut deeper than its fearful edge; And I, a man, a soldier, and a prince, Before this motley patchwork of a man, Stand all appalled, as if he were a glass Wherein I saw my own deformity. O Heaven! a tearâone little tearâto wash This aching dryness of the heart away! (Enter Paolo.) Paolo. What ails the fool? He passed me, muttering The strangest garbage in the fiercest tone. âHa! ha!â cried he, âthey made a fool of meâ A motley man, a slave; as if I felt No stir in me of manly dignity! Ha! ha! a foolâa painted plaything, toyâ For men to kick about this dirty world!â My world as well as theirs.âGod's world, I trow! I will get even with them yetâha! ha! In the democracy of death we'll square. I'll crawl and lie beside a king's own son; Kiss a young princess, dead lip to dead lip; Pull the Pope's nose; and kick down Charlemagne, Throne, crown, and all, where the old idiot sprawls, Safe as he thinks, rotting in royal state!â And then he laughed and gibbered, as if drunk With some infernal ecstasy. Lan. Poor fool! That is the groundwork of his malice, then,â His conscious difference from the rest of men? I, of all men, should pity him the most. Poor Pepe! I'll be kinder. I have wronged A feeling heart. Poor Pepe! Paolo. Sad again! Where has the rapture gone of yesterday? Lan. Where are the leaves of Summer? Where the snows Of last year's Winter? Where the joys and griefs That shut our eyes to yesternight's repose, And woke not on the morrow? Joys and griefs, Huntsmen and hounds, ye follow us as game, Poor panting outcasts of your forest-law! Each cheers the others,âone with wild halloos, And one with whines and howls.âA dreadful chase, That only closes when horns sound amort! Paolo. Thus ever up and down! Arouse yourself, Balance your mind more evenly, and hunt For honey in the wormwood. Lan. Or find gall Hid in the hanging chalice of the rose: Which think you better? If my mood offend, We'll turn to business,âto the empty cares That make such pother in our feverish life. When at Ravenna, did you ever hear Of any romance in Francesca's life? A love-tilt, gallantry, or anything That might have touched her heart? Paolo. Not lightly even. I think her heart as virgin as her hand. Lan. Then there is hope. Paolo. Of what? Lan. Of winning her. Paolo. Grammercy! Lanciotto, are you sane? You boasted yesterdayâ Lan. And changed to-day. Is that so strange? I always mend the fault Of yesterday with wisdom of to-day. She does not love me. Paolo. Pshaw! she marries you: 'T were proof enough for me. Lan. Perhaps, she loves you. Paolo. Me, Lanciotto, me! For mercy's sake, Blot out such thoughtsâthey madden me! What, loveâ She loveâyet marry you! Lan. It moves you much. 'T was but a fleeting fancy, nothing more. Paolo. You have such wild conjectures! Lan. Well, to me They seem quite tame; they are my bed-fellows. Think, to a modest woman, what must be The loathsome kisses of an unloved manâ A gross, coarse ruffian! Paolo. O! good heavens, forbear! Lan. What shocks you so? Paolo. The picture which you draw, Wronging yourself by horrid images. Lan. Until she love me, till I know, beyond The cavil of a doubt, that she is mineâ Wholly, past questionâdo you think that I Could so afflict the woman whom I love? Paolo. You love her, Lanciotto! Lan. Next to you, Dearer than anything in nature's scope. Paolo. (Aside.) O! Heaven, that I must bear this! Yes, and more,â More torture than I dare to think upon, Spreads out before me with the coming years, And holds a record blotted with my tears, As that which I must suffer! Lan. Come, Paolo, Come help me woo. I need your guiding eye, To signal me, if I should sail astray. Paolo. O! torture, torture! [Aside.] Lan. You and I, perchance, Joining our forces, may prevail at last. They call love like a battle. As for me, I'm not a soldier equal to such wars, Despite my arduous schooling. Tutor me In the best arts of amorous strategy. I am quite raw, Paolo. Glances, sighs, Sweets of the lip, and arrows of the eye, Shrugs, cringes, compliments, are new to me; And I shall handle them with little art. Will you instruct me? Paolo. Conquer for yourself. Two captains share one honor: keep it all. What if I ask to share the spoils? Lan. (Laughing.) Ha! ha! I'll trust you, brother. Let us go to her: Francesca is neglected while we jest. I know not how it is, but your fair face, And noble figure, always cheer me up, More than your words; there 's healing in them, too, For my worst griefs. Dear brother, let us in. [Exeunt.] SCENE II. The Same. A Chamber in the Same. Francesca and Ritta discovered at the bridal toilet. Ritta. (Sings.) Ring high, ring high! to earth and sky; A lady goes a-wedding; The people shout, the show draws out, And smiles the bride is shedding. No bell for you, ye ragged few; A beggar goes a-wedding; The people sneer, the thing 's so queer, And tears the bride is shedding. Ring low, ring low! dull bell of woe, One tone will do for either; The lady glad, and beggar sad, Have both lain down together. Francesca. A mournful ballad! Ritta. I scarce knew I sang. I'm weary of this wreath. These orange-flowers Will never be adjusted to my taste: Strive as I will, they ever look awry. My fingers ache! Fran. Not more than my poor head. There, leave them so. Rit. That 's better, yet not well. Fran. They are but fading things, not worth your pains: They'll scarce outlive the marriage merriment. Ritta, these flowers are hypocrites; they show An outside gayety, yet die within, Minute by minute. You shall see them fall, Black with decay, before the rites are o'er. Rit. How beautiful you are! Fran. Fie, flatterer! White silk and laces, pearls and orange-flowers, Would do as much for any one. Rit. No, no! You give them grace, they nothing give to you. Why, after all, you make the wreath look well; But somewhat dingy, where it lies against Your pulsing temple, sullen with disgrace. Ah! well, your Count should be the proudest man That ever led a lady into church, Were he a modern Alexander. Poh! What are his trophies to a face like that? Fran. I seem to please you, Ritta. Rit. Please yourself, And you will please me better. You are sad: I marked it ever since you saw the Count. I fear the splendor of his victories, And his sweet grace of mannerâfor, in faith, His is the gentlest, grandest character, Despite hisâ Fran. Well? Rit. Despite hisâ Fran. Ritta, What? Rit. Despite his difference from Count Paolo.â [Francesca staggers.] What is the matter? [Supporting her.] Fran. Nothing; mere fatigue. Hand me my kerchief. I am better now. What were you saying? Rit. That I fear the Count Has won your love. Fran. Would that be cause for fear? [Laughing.] Rit. O! yes, indeed! Onceâlong agoâI was Just fool enough to tangle up my heart With one of these same men. 'T was terrible! Morning or evening, waking or asleep, I had no peace. Sighs, groans, and standing tears, Counted my moments through the blessed day. And then to this there was a dull, strange ache Forever sleeping in my breast,âa numbing pain, That would not for an instant be forgot. O! but I loved him so, that very feeling Became intolerable. And I believed This false Giuseppe, too, for all the sneers, The shrugs and glances, of my intimates. They slandered me and him, yet I believed. He was a noble, and his love to me Was a reproach, a shame, yet I believed. He wearied of me, tried to shake me off, Grew cold and formal, yet I would not doubt. O! lady, I was true! Nor till I saw Giuseppe walk through the cathedral door With Dora, the rich usurer's niece, upon The very arm to which I clung so oft, Did I so much as doubt him. Even thenâ More is my shameâI made excuses for him. âJust this or that had forced him to the course: Perhaps, he loved me yetâa little yet. His fortune, or his family, had driven My poor Giuseppe thus against his heart. The low are sorry judges for the great. Yes, yes, Giuseppe loved me!â But at last I did awake. It might have been with less: There was no need of crushing me, to break My silly dream up. In the street, it chanced, Dora and he went by me, and he laughedâ A bold, bad laughâright in my poor pale face, And turned and whispered Dora, and she laughed. Ah! then I saw it all. I 've been awake, Ever since then, I warrant you. And now I only pray for him sometimes, when friends Tell his base actions towards his hapless wife.â O! I am lyingâI pray every night! [Weeps.] Fran. Poor Ritta! [Weeping.] Rit. No! blest Ritta! Thank kind Heaven, That kept me spotless when he tempted me, And my weak heart was pleading with his tongue. Pray, do not weep. You spoil your eyes for me. But never love; O! it is terrible! Fran. I'll strive against it. Rit. Do: because, my lady, Even a husband may be false, you know; Ay, even to so sweet a wife as you. Men have odd tastes. They'll surfeit on the charms Of Cleopatra, and then turn aside To woo her blackamoor. 'T is so, in faith; Or Dora's uncle's gold had ne'er outbid The boundless measure of a love like mine. Think of it, lady, to weigh love with gold! What could be meaner? Fran. Nothing, nothing, Ritta. Though gold 's the standard measure of the world, And seems to lighten everything beside. Yet heap the other passions in the scale, And balance them 'gainst that which gold outweighsâ Against this loveâand you shall see how light The most supreme of them are in the poise! I speak by book and history; for love Slights my high fortunes. Under cloth of state The urchin cowers from pompous etiquette, Waiving his function at the scowl of power, And seeks the rustic cot to stretch his limbs In homely freedom. I fulfil a doom. We who are topmost on this heap of life Are nearer to Heaven's hand than you below; And so are used, as ready instruments, To work its purposes. Let envy hide Her witless forehead at a prince's name, And fix her hopes upon a clown's content. You, happy lowly, know not what it is To groan beneath the crownÃ©d yoke of state, And bear the goadings of the sceptre. Ah! Fate drives us onward in a narrow way, Despite our boasted freedom. (Enter Paolo, with Pages bearing torches.) Gracious saints! What brought you here? Paolo. The bridegroom waits. Fran. He does? Let him wait on forever! I'll not go! O! dear Paoloâ Paolo. Sister! Fran. It is well. I have been troubled with a sleepless night. My brain is wild. I know not what I say. Pray, do not call me sister: it is cold. I never had a brother, and the name Sounds harshly to me. When you speak to me, Call me Francesca. Paolo. You shall be obeyed. Fran. I would not be obeyed. I 'd have you do it Becauseâbecause you love meâas a sisterâ And of your own good-will, not my command, Would please me.âDo you understand? Paolo. Too well! [Aside.] 'T is a nice difference. Fran. Yet you understand? Say that you do. Paolo. I do. Fran. That pleases me. 'T is flattering if ourâfriends appreciate Our nicer feelings. Paolo. I await you, lady. Fran. Ritta, my gloves.âAh! yes, I have them on; Though I 'm not quite prepared. Arrange my veil; It folds too closely. That will do; retire. [Ritta retires.] So, Count Paolo, you have come, hot haste, To lead me to the church,âto have your share In my undoing? And you came, in sooth, Because they sent you? You are very tame! And if they sent, was it for you to come? Paolo. Lady, I do not understand this scorn. I came, as is my duty, to escort My brother's bride to him. When next you 're called, I'll send a lackey. Fran. I have angered you. Paolo. With reason: I would not appear to you Low or contemptible. Fran. Why not to me? Paolo. Lady, I'll not be catechized. Fran. Ha! Count! Paolo. No! if you press me further, I will say A word to madden you.âStand still! You stray Around the margin of a precipice. I know what pleasure 't is to pluck the flowers That hang above destruction, and to gaze Into the dread abyss, to see such things As may be safely seen. 'T is perilous: The eye grows dizzy as we gaze below, And a wild wish possesses us to spring Into the vacant air. Beware, beware! Lest this unholy fascination grow Too strong to conquer! Fran. You talk wildly, Count; There 's not a gleam of sense in what you say; I cannot hit your meaning. Paolo. Lady, come! Fran. Count, you are cruel! [Weeps.] Paolo. O! no; I would be kind. But now, while reason over-rides my heart, And seeming anger plays its braggart partâ In heaven's name, come! Fran. One wordâone question more: Is it your wish this marriage should proceed? Paolo. It is. Fran. Come on! You shall not take my hand: I'll walk aloneânow, and forever! Paolo. (Taking her hand.) Sister! [Exeunt Paolo and Francesca, with Pages.] Ritta. O! misery, misery!âit is plain as dayâ She loves Paolo! Why will those I love Forever get themselves ensnared, and heaven Forever call on me to succor them? Here was the mystery, thenâthe sighs and tears, The troubled slumbers, and the waking dreams! And now she 's walking through the chapel-door, Her bridal robe above an aching heart, Dressed up for sacrifice. 'T is terrible! And yet she'll smile and do it. Smile, for years, Until her heart breaks; and the nurses ask The doctor of the cause. He'll answer too, In hard thick Latin, and believe himself. O! my dear mistress! Heaven, pray torture me! Send back Giuseppe, let him ruin me, And scorn me after; but, sweet heaven, spare her! I'll follow her. O! what a world is this! [Exit.] SCENE III. The Same. Interior of the Cathedral. Lanciotto, Francesca, Paolo, Malatesta, Guido, Ritta, Pepe, Lords, Knights, Priests, Pages, a bridal-train of Ladies, Soldiers, Citizens, Attendants, &amp;c., discovered before the High Altar. Organ music. The rites being over, they advance. Malatesta. By heavenâ Pepe. O! uncle, uncle, you 're in church! Mal. I'll break your head, knave! Pepe. I claim sanctuary. Mal. Why, bridegroom, will you never kiss the bride? We all are mad to follow you. Pepe. Yes, yes; Here was Paolo wetting his red lips For the last minute. Kiss, and give him room. Mal. You heaven-forsaken imp, be quiet now! Pepe. Then there 'd be naught worth hearing. Mal. Bridegroom, come! Pepe. Lord! he don't like it! Hey!âI told you soâ He backs at the first step. Does he not know His trouble 's just begun? Lanciotto. Gentle Francesca, Custom imposes somewhat on thy lips: I'll make my levy. [Kisses her. The others follow.] (Aside.) Ha! she shrank! I felt Her body tremble, and her quivering lips Seemed dying under mine! I heard a sigh, Such as breaks heartsâO! no, a very groan; And then she turned a sickly, miserable look On pale Paolo, and he shivered too! There is a mystery hangs around her,âay, Paolo knows it too.âBy all the saints, I'll make him tell it, at the dagger's point! Paolo!âhere! I do adjure you, brother, By the great love I bear you, to reveal The secret of Francesca's grief. Paolo. I cannot. Lan. She told you nothing? Paolo. Nothing. Lan. Not a word? Paolo. Not one. Lan. What heard you at Ravenna, then? Paolo. Nothing Lan. Here? Paolo. Nothing. Lan. Not the slightest hint?â Don't stammer, man! Speak quick! I am in haste. Paolo. Never. Lan. What know you? Paolo. Nothing that concerns Your happiness, Lanciotto. If I did, Would I not tell unquestioned? Lan. Would you not? You ask a question for me: answer it. Paolo. I have. Lan. You juggle, you turn deadly pale, Fumble your dagger, stand with head half round, Tapping your feet.âYou dare not look at me! By Satan! Count Paolo, let me say, You look much like a full-convicted thief! Paolo. Brother!â Lan. Pshaw! brother! You deceive me, sir: You and that lady have a devil's league, To keep a devil's secret. Is it thus You deal with me? Now, by the light above, I 'd give a dukedom for some fair pretext To fly you all! She does not love me? Well, I could bear that, and live away from her. Love would be sweet, but want of it becomes An early habit to such men as I. But youâah! there 's the sorrowâwhom I loved An infant in your cradle; you who grew Up in my heart, with every inch you gained; You whom I loved for every quality, Good, bad, and common, in your natural stock; Ay, for your very beauty! It is strange, you'll say, For such a crippled horror to do that, Against the custom of his kind! O! yes, I love, and you betray me! Paolo. Lanciotto, This is sheer frenzy. Join your bride. Lan. I'll not! What, go to her, to feel her very flesh Crawl from my touch?âto hear her sigh and moan, As if God plagued her? Must I come to that? Must I endure your hellish mystery With my own wife, and roll my eyes away In sentimental bliss? No, no! until I go to her, with confident belief In her integrity and candid love, I'll shun her as a leper! [Alarm-bells toll.] Mal. What is that? (Enter, hastily, a Messenger in disorder.) Messenger. My lord, the Ghibelins are upâ Lan. And I Will put them down again! I thank thee, Heaven, For this unlooked-for aid! [Aside.] Mal. What force have they? Lan. It matters not,ânor yet the time, place, cause, Of their rebellion. I would throttle it, Were it a riot, or a drunken brawl! Mal. Nay, son, your brideâ Lan. My bride will pardon me; Bless me, perhaps, as I am going forth;â Thank me, perhaps, if I should ne'er return. [Aside.] A soldier's duty has no bridals in it. Paolo. Lanciotto, this is folly. Let me take Your usual place of honor. Lan. (Laughing.) Ha! ha! ha! What! thou, a tilt-yard soldier, lead my troops! My wife will ask it shortly. Not a word Of opposition from the new-made bride? Nay, she looks happier. O! accursed day, That I was mated to an empty heart! [Aside.] Mal. But, sonâ Lan. Well, father? Pepe. Uncle, let him go. He'll find it cooler on a battle-field Than in hisâ Lan. Hark! the fool speaks oracles. You, soldiers, who are used to follow me, And front our charges, emulous to bear The shock of battle on your forward arms,â Why stand ye in amazement? Do your swords Stick to their scabbards with inglorious rust? Or has repose so weakened your big hearts, That you can dream with trumpets at your ears? Out with your steel! It shames me to behold Such tardy welcome to my war-worn blade! [Draws.] (The Knights and Soldiers draw.) Ho! draw our forces out! Strike camp, sound drums, And set us on our marches! As I live, I pity the next foeman who relies On me for mercy! Farewell! to you allâ To all alikeâa soldier's short farewell! [Going.] (Paolo stands before him.) Out of my way, thou juggler! [Exit.] Paolo. He is gone! ACT V. SCENE I. The Same. The Garden of the Castle. Enter Pepe, singing. Pepe. 'T is jolly to walk in the shady greenwood With a damsel by your side; 'T is jolly to walk from the chapel-door, With the hand of your pretty bride; 'T is jolly to rest your weary head, When life runs low and hope is fled, On the heart where you confide: 'T is jolly, jolly, jolly, they say, They sayâbut I never tried. Nor shall I ever till they dress their girls In motley suits, and pair us, to increase The race of fools. 'T would be a noble thing, A motley woman, had she wit enough To bear the bell. But there 's the misery: You may make princes out of any stuff; Fools come by nature. She'll make fifty kingsâ Good, hearty tyrants, sound, cruel governorsâ For one fine fool. There is Paolo, now, A sweet-faced fellow with a wicked heartâ Talk of a flea, and you begin to scratch. Lo! here he comes. And there 's fierce crook-back's bride Walking beside himâO, how gingerly! Take care, my love! that is the very pace We trip to hell with. Hunchback is awayâ That was a fair escape for you; but, then, The devil 's ever with us, and that 's worse. See, the Ravenna giglet, Mistress Ritta, And melancholy as a cow.âHow 's this? I'll step aside, and watch you, pretty folks. [Hides behind the bushes.] (Enter Paolo and Francesca, followed by Ritta. He seats himself in an arbor, and reads. Ritta and Francesca advance.) Francesca. Ritta. Ritta. My lady. Fran. You look tired. Rit. I'm not. Fran. Go to your chamber. Rit. I would rather stay, If it may please you. I require a walk And the fresh atmosphere of breathing flowers, To stir my blood. I am not very well. Fran. I knew it, child. Go to your chamber, dear. Paolo has a book to read to me. Rit. What, the romance? I should so love to hear! I dote on poetry; and Count Paolo Sweetens the Tuscan with his mellow voice. I 'm weary now, quite weary, and would rest. Fran. Just now you wished to walk. Rit. Ah! did I so? Walking, or resting, I would stay with you. Fran. The Count objects. He told me, yesterday, That you were restless while he read to me; And stirred your feet amid the grass, and sighed, And yawned, until he almost paused. Rit. Indeed I will be quiet. Fran. But he will not read. Rit. Let me go ask him. [Runs towards Paolo.] Fran. Stop! Come hither, Ritta. [She returns.] I saw your new embroidery in the hall,â The needle in the midst of Argus' eyes; It should be finished. Rit. I will bring it here.â O no! my finger 's sore; I cannot work. Fran. Go to your room. Rit. Let me remain, I pray. 'T is better, lady; you may wish for me: I know you will be sorry if I go. Fran. I shall not, girl. Do as I order you. Will you be headstrong? Rit. Do you wish it, then? Fran. Yes, Ritta. Rit. Yet you made pretexts enough, Before you ordered. Fran. You are insolent. Will you remain against my will? Rit. Yes, lady; Rather than not remain. Fran. Ha! impudent! Rit. You wrong me, gentle mistress. Love like mine Does not ask questions of propriety, Nor stand on manners. I would do you good, Even while you smote me; I would push you back, With my last effort, from the crumbling edge Of some high rock o'er which you toppled me. Fran. What do you mean? Rit. I know. Fran. Know what? Rit. Too much. Pray, do not ask me. Fran. Speak! Rit. I knowâdear lady, Be not offendedâ Fran. Tell me, simpleton! Rit. You know I worship you; you know I'd walk Straight into ruin for a whim of yours; You knowâ Fran. I know you act the fool. Talk sense! Rit. I know Paolo loves you. Fran. Should he not? He is my brother. Rit. More than brother should. Fran. Ha! are you certain? Rit. Yes, of more than that. Fran. Of more? Rit. Yes, lady; for you love him too. I 've said it! Fling me to the carrion crows, Kill me by inches, boil me in the pot Count Guido promised me,âbut, O, beware! Back, while you may! Make me the sufferer, But save yourself! Fran. Now, are you not ashamed, To look me in the face with that bold brow? I am amazed! Rit. I am a woman, lady; I too have been in love; I know its ways, Its arts, and its deceits. Your frowning face, And seeming indignation, do not cheat. Your heart is in my hand. Paolo. (Calls.) Francesca! Fran. Hence, Thou wanton-hearted minion! hence, I say!â And never look me in the face again!â Hence, thou insulting slave! Rit. (Clinging to her.) O lady, ladyâ Fran. Begone! [Throws her off.] Rit. I have no friendsâno one to loveâ O, spare me! Fran. Hence! Rit. Was it for this I lovedâ Cared for you more than my own happinessâ Ever at heart your slaveâwithout a wish For greater recompense than your stray smiles? Paolo. (Calls.) Francesca! Fran. Hurry! Rit. I am gone. Alas! God bless you, lady! God take care of you, When I am far away! Alas, alas! [Exit weeping.] Fran. Poor girl!âbut were she all the world to me, And held my future in her tender grasp, I 'd cast her off, without a second thought, To savage death, for dear Paolo's sake! Paolo, hither! Now he comes to me; I feel his presence, though I see him not, Stealing upon me like the fervid glow Of morning sunshine. Now he comes too nearâ He touches meâO Heaven! Paolo. Our poem waits. I have been reading while you talked with Ritta. How did you get her off? Fran. By some device. She will not come again. Paolo. I hate the girl: She seems to stand between me and the light. And now for the romance. Where left we off? Fran. Where Lancelot and Queen Guenevra strayed Along the forest, in the youth of May. You marked the figure of the birds that sang Their melancholy farewell to the sunâ Rich in his loss, their sorrow glorifiedâ Like gentle mourners o'er a great man's grave. Was it not there? No, no; 't was where they sat Down on the bank, by one impulsive wish That neither uttered. Paolo. (Turning over the book.) Here it is. (Reads.) âSo sat Guenevra and Sir Lancelotââ'T were well To follow them in that. [They sit upon a bank.] Fran. I listen: read. Nay, do not; I can wait, if you desire. Paolo. My dagger frets me; let me take it off. [Rises.] In thoughts of love, we'll lay our weapons by. [Lays aside his dagger, and sits again.] Draw closer: I am weak in voice to-day. [Reads.] âSo sat Guenevra and Sir Lancelot, Under the blaze of the descending sun, But all his cloudy splendors were forgot. Each bore a thought, the only secret one, Which each had hidden from the other's heart, Both with sweet mystery well-nigh overrun. Anon, Sir Lancelot, with gentle start, Put by the ripples of her golden hair, Gazing upon her with his lips apart. He marvelled human thing could be so fair; Essayed to speak; but, in the very deed, His words expired of self-betrayed despair. Little she helped him, at his direst need, Roving her eyes o'er hill, and wood, and sky, Peering intently at the meanest weed; Ay, doing aught but look in Lancelot's eye. Then, with the small pique of her velvet shoe, Uprooted she each herb that blossomed nigh; Or strange wild figures in the dust she drew; Until she felt Sir Lancelot's arm around Her waist, upon her cheek his breath like dew. While through his fingers timidly he wound Her shining locks; and, haply, when he brushed Her ivory skin, Guenevra nearly swound: For where he touched, the quivering surface blushed, Firing her blood with most contagious heat, Till brow, check, neck, and bosom, all were flushed. Each heart was listening to the other beat. As twin-born lilies on one golden stalk, Drooping with Summer, in warm languor meet, So met their faces. Down the forest walk Sir Lancelot lookedâhe looked cast, west, north, southâ No soul was nigh, his dearest wish to balk: She smiled; he kissed her full upon the mouth.â [Kisses Francesca.] I'll read no more! [Starts up, dashing down the book.] Fran. Paolo! Paolo. I am mad! The torture of unnumbered hours is o'er, The straining cord has broken, and my heart Riots in free delirium! O, Heaven! I struggled with it, but it mastered me! I fought against it, but it beat me down! I prayed, I wept, but Heaven was deaf to me; And every tear rolled backward on my heart, To blight and poison! Fran. And dost thou regret? Paolo. The love? No, no! I'd dare it all again, Its direst agonies and meanest fears, For that one kiss. Away with fond remorse! Here, on the brink of ruin, we two stand; Lock hands with me, and brave the fearful plunge! Thou canst not name a terror so profound That I will look or falter from. Be bold! I know thy loveâI knew it long agoâ Trembled and fled from it. But now I clasp The peril to my breast, and ask of thee A kindred desperation. Fran. (Throwing herself into his arms.) Take me all,â Body and soul! The women of our clime Do never give away but half a heart: I have not part to give, part to withhold, In selfish safety. When I saw thee first, Riding alone amid a thousand men, Sole in the lustre of thy majesty, And Guido da Polenta said to me, âDaughter, behold thy husband!â with a bound My heart went forth to meet thee. He deceived, He lied to meâah! that 's the aptest wordâ And I believed. Shall I not turn again, And meet him, craft with craft? Paolo, love. Thou 'rt dullâthou 'rt dying like a feeble fire Before the sunshine. Was it but a blaze, A flash of glory, and a long, long night? Paolo. No, darling, no! You could not bend me back; My course is onward; but my heart is sick With coming fears. Fran. Away with them! Must I Teach thee to love? and reÃ¯nform the ear Of thy spent passion with some sorcery To raise the chilly dead? Paolo. Thy lips have not A sorcery to rouse me as this spell. [Kisses her.] Fran. I give thy kisses back to thee again: And, like a spendthrift, only ask of thee To take while I can give. Paolo. Give, give forever! Have we not touched the height of human bliss? And if the sharp rebound may hurl us back Among the prostrate, did we not soar once?â Taste heavenly nectar, banquet with the gods On high Olympus? If they cast us, now, Amid the furies, shall we not go down With rich ambrosia clinging to our lips, And richer memories settled in our hearts? Francesca. Fran. Love? Paolo. The sun is sinking low Upon the ashes of his fading pyre, And gray possesses the eternal blue; The evening star is stealing after him, Fixed, like a beacon, on the prow of night; The world is shutting up its heavy eye Upon the stir and bustle of to-day;â On what shall it awake? Fran. On love that gives Joy at all seasons, changes night to day, Makes sorrow smile, plucks out the barbÃ©d dart Of moaning anguish, pours celestial balm In all the gaping wounds of earth, and lulls The nervous fancies of unsheltered fear Into a slumber sweet as infancy's! On love that laughs at the impending sword, And puts aside the shield of caution: cries, To all its enemies, âCome, strike me now!â Now, while I hold my kingdom, while my crown Of amaranth and myrtle is yet green, Undimmed, unwithered; for I cannot tell That I shall e'er be happier!â Dear Paolo, Would you lapse down from misery to death, Tottering through sorrow and infirmity? Or would you perish at a single blow, Cut off amid your wildest revelry, Falling among the wine-cups and the flowers, And tasting Bacchus when your drowsy sense First gazed around eternity? Come, love! The present whispers joy to us; we'll hear The voiceless future when its turn arrives. Paolo. Thou art a siren. Sing, forever sing! Hearing thy voice, I cannot tell what fate Thou hast provided when the song is o'er;â But I will venture it. Fran. In, in, my love! [Exeunt.] (Pepe steals from behind the bushes.) Pepe. O, brother Lanciotto!âO, my stars!â If this thing lasts, I simply shall go mad! [Laughs, and rolls on the ground.] O Lord! to think my pretty lady puss Had tricks like this, and we ne'er know of it! I tell you, Lanciotto, you and I Must have a patent for our foolery! âShe smiled; he kissed her full upon the mouth!ââ There 's the beginning; where 's the end of it? O poesy! debauch thee only once, And thou 'rt the greatest wanton in the world! O cousin Lanciottoâho, ho, ho! [Laughing.] Can a man die of laughter? Here we sat; Mistress Francesca so demure and calm; Paolo grand, poetical, sublime!â Eh! what is this? Paolo's dagger? Good! Here is more proof, sweet cousin Broken-back. âIn thoughts of love, we'll lay our weapons by!â [Mimicking Paolo.] That 's very pretty! Here 's its counterpart: In thoughts of hate, we'll pick them up again! [Takes the dagger.] Now for my soldier, now for crook-backed Mars! Ere long all Rimini will be ablaze. He'll kill me? Yes: what then? That 's nothing new, Except to me; I'll bear for custom's sake. More blood will follow; like the royal sun, I shall go down in purple. Fools for luck; The proverb holds like iron. I must run, Ere laughter smother me.âO, ho, ho, ho! [Exit, laughing.] SCENE II. A Camp among the Hills. Before Lanciotto's tent. Enter, from the tent, Lanciotto. Lanciotto. The camp is strangely quiet. Not a sound Breaks nature's high solemnity. The sun Repeats again his every-day decline; Yet all the world looks sadly after him, As if the customary sight were new. Yon moody sentinel goes slowly by, Through the thick mists of evening, with his spear Trailed at a funeral hold. Long shadows creep, From things beyond the furthest range of sight, Up to my very feet. These mystic shades Are of the earth; the light that causes them, And teaches us the quick comparison, Is all from heaven. Ah! restless man might crawl With patience through his shadowy destiny, If he were senseless to the higher light Towards which his soul aspires. How grand and vast Is yonder show of heavenly pageantry! How mean and narrow is the earthly stand From which we gaze on it! Magnificent, O God, art thou amid the sunsets! Ah! What heart in Rimini is softened now, Towards my defects, by this grand spectacle? Perchance, Paolo now forgives the wrong Of my hot spleen. Perchance, Francesca now Wishes me back, and turns a tenderer eye On my poor person and ill-mannered ways; Fashions excuses for me, schools her heart Through duty into love, and ponders o'er The sacred meaning in the name of wife. Dreams, dreams! Poor fools, we squander love away On thankless borrowers; when bankrupt quite, We sit and wonder of their honesty. Love, take a lesson from the usurer, And never lend but on security. Captain! (Enter a Captain.) Captain. My lord. Lan. They worsted us to-day. Capt. Not much, my lord. Lan. With little loss, indeed. Their strength is in position. Mark you, sir. [Draws on the ground with his sword.] Here is the pass; it opens towards the plain, With gradual widening, like a lady's fan. The hills protect their flanks on either hand; And, as you see, we cannot show more front Than their advance may give us. Then, the rocks Are sorry footing for our horse. Just here, Close in against the left-hand hills, I marked A strip of wood, extending down the gorge: Behind that wood dispose your force ere dawn. I shall begin the onset, then give ground, And draw them out; while you, behind the wood, Must steal along, until their flank and rear Oppose your column. Then set up a shout, Burst from the wood, and drive them on our spears, They have no outpost in the wood, I know; 'T is too far from their centre. On the morrow, When they are flushed with seeming victory, And think my whole division in full rout, They will not pause to scrutinize the wood; So you may enter boldly. We will use The heart to-day's repulse has given to them, For our advantage. Do you understand? Capt. Clearly, my lord. Lan. If they discover you, Before you gain your point, wheel, and retreat Upon my rear. If your attack should fail To strike them with a panic, and they turn In too great numbers on your small command, Scatter your soldiers through the wood: Let each seek safety for himself. Capt. I see. Lan. Have Pluto shod; he cast a shoe to-day: Let it be done at once. My helmet, too, Is worn about the lacing; look to that. Where is my armorer? Capt. At his forge. Lan. Your charge Must be at sunriseâjust at sunrise, sirâ Neither before nor after. You must march At moonset, then, to gain the point ere dawn. That is enough. Capt. Good-even! [Going.] Lan. Stay, stay, stay! My sword-hilt feels uneasy in my grasp; [Gives his sword.] Have it repaired; and grind the point. Strike hard! I'll teach these Ghibelins a lesson. [Loud laughter within.] Ha! What is that clamor? (Enter hastily Pepe, tattered and travel-stained.) Pepe. News from Rimini! [Falls exhausted.] Lan. Is that you, Pepe? Captain, a good-night! [Exit Captain.] I never saw you in such straits before. Wit without words! Pepe. That's better thanâO!âO!â [Panting.] Words without wit. Lan. (Laughing.) You'll die a jester, Pepe. Pepe. If so, I'll leave the needy all my wit. You, you shall have it, cousin.âO! O! O! [Panting.] Those devils in the hills, the Ghibelins, Ran me almost to death. My lordâha! ha! [Laughing.] It all comes back to meâO! Lord 'a mercy!â The garden, and the lady, and the Count! Not to forget the poetryâho! ho! [Laughing.] O! cousin Lanciotto, such a wife, And such a brother! Hear me, ere I burst! Lan. You 're pleasant, Pepe! Pepe. Am I?âHo! ho! ho! [Laughing.] You ought to be; your wife 's aâ Lan. What? Pepe. A ladyâ A lady, I suppose, like all the rest. I am not in their secrets. Such a fellow As Count Paolo is your man for that. I'll tell you something, if you'll swear a bit. Lan. Swear what? Pepe. First, swear to listen till the end.â O! you may rave, curse, howl, and tear your hair; But you must listen. Lan. For your jest's sake? Well. Pepe. You swear? Lan. I do. Pepe. Next, swear to know the truth. Lan. The truth of a fool's story! Pepe. You mistake. Now, look you, cousin! You have often markedâ I know, for I have seenâstrange glances pass Between Paolo and your lady wife.â Lan. Ha! Pepe! Pepe. Now I touch you to the quick. I know the reason of those glances. Lan. Ha! Speak! or I'll throttle you! [Seizes him.] Pepe. Your way is odd. Let go my gullet, and I'll talk you deaf. Swear my last oath: only to know the truth. Lan. But that may trouble me. Pepe. Your honor liesâ Your precious honor, cousin Chivalryâ Lies bleeding with a terrible great gash, Without its knowledge. Swear! Lan. My honor? Speak! Pepe. You swear? Lan. I swear. Your news is ill, perchance? Pepe. Ill! would I bring it else? Am I inclined To run ten leagues with happy news for you? O, Lord! that 's jolly! Lan. You infernal imp, Out with your story, ere I strangle you! Pepe. Then take a fast hold on your two great oaths, To steady tottering manhood, and attend. Last eve, about this hour, I took a stroll Into the garden.âAre you listening, cousin? Lan. I am all ears. Pepe. Why, so an ass might say. Lan. Will you be serious? Pepe. Wait a while, and we Will both be graver than a church-yard. Well, Down the long walk, towards me, came your wife, With Count Paolo walking at her side. It was a pretty sight, and so I stepped Into the bushes. Ritta came with them; And Lady Fanny had a grievous time To get her off. That made me curious. Anon, the pair sat down upon a bank, To read a poem;âthe tenderest romance, All about Lancelot and Queen Guenevra. The Count read wellâI'll say that much for himâ Only he stuck too closely to the text, Got too much wrapped up in the poesy, And played Sir Lancelot's actions, out and out, On Queen Francesca. Nor in royal parts Was she so backward. When he struck the lineâ âShe smiled; he kissed her full upon the mouth;â Your lady smiled, and, by the saints above, Paolo carried out the sentiment! Can I not move you? Lan. With such trash as this? And so you ran ten leagues to tell a lie?â Run home again. Pepe. I am not ready yet. After the kiss, up springs our amorous Count, Flings Queen Guenevra and Sir Lancelot Straight to the devil; growls and snaps his teeth, Laughs, weeps, howls, dances; talks about his love, His madness, suffering, and the Lord knows what, Bullying the lady like a thief. But she, All this hot time, looked cool and mischievous; Gave him his halter to the very end; And when he calmed a little, up she steps And takes him by the hand. You should have seen How tame the furious fellow was at once! How he came down, snivelled, and cowed to her, And fell to kissing her again! It was A perfect female triumph! Such a scene A man might pass through life and never see. More sentiment then followed,âbuckets full Of washy words, not worth my memory. But all the while she wound his Countship up, Closer and closer; till at lastâtu!âwit!â She scoops him up, and off she carries him, Fish for her table! Follow, if you can; My fancy fails me. All this time you smile! Lan. You should have been a poet, not a fool. Pepe. I might be both. Lan. You made no record, then? Must this fine story die for want of ink? Left you no trace in writing? Pepe. None. Lan. Alas! Then you have told it? 'T is but stale, my boy; I'm second hearer. Pepe. You are first, in faith. Lan. In truth? Pepe. In sadness. You have got it fresh. I had no time; I itched to reach your ear. Now go to Rimini, and see yourself. You'll find them in the garden. Lovers are Like walking ghosts, they always haunt the spot Of their misdeeds. Lan. But have I heard you out? You told me all? Pepe. All; I have nothing left. Lan. Why, you brain-stricken idiot, to trust Your story and your body in my grasp! [Seizes him.] Pepe. Unhand me, cousin! Lan. When I drop you, Pepe, You'll be at rest. Pepe. I will betray youâO! Lan. Not till the judgment day. [They struggle.] Pepe. (Drawing Paolo's dagger.) Take that! Lan. (Wresting the dagger from him.) Well meant, But poorly done! Here 's my return. [Stabs him.] Pepe. O! beast! [Falls.] This I expected; it is naughtâHa! ha! [Laughing.] I'll go to sleep; but youâwhat you will bear! Hunchback, come here! Lan. Fie! say your prayers. Pepe. Hark, hark! Paolo hired me, swine, to murder you. Lan. That is a lie; you never cared for gold. Pepe. He did, I say! I'll swear to it, by heaven! Do you believe me? Lan. No! Pepe. You lie! you lie! Look at the dagger, cousinâUgh!âgood-night! [Dies.] Lan. O! horrible! It was a gift of mineâ He never laid it by. Speak, speak, fool, speak! [Shakes the body.] How didst thou get it?âspeak! Thou 'rt warmânot deadâ Thou hast a tongueâO! speak! Come, come, a jestâ Another jest from those thin mocking lips! Call me a crippleâhunchbackâwhat thou wilt; But speak to me! He cannot. Now, by heaven, I'll stir this business till I find the truth! Am I a fool? It is a silly lie, Coined by yon villain with his last base breath. What ho! without there! (Enter Captain and Soldiers.) Captain. Did you call, my lord? Lan. Did Heaven thunder? Are you deaf, you louts? Saddle my horse! What are you staring at? Is it your first look at a dead man? Well, Then look your fill. Saddle my horse, I say! Black Plutoâstir! Bear that assassin hence. Chop him to pieces, if he move. My horse! Capt. My lord, he 's shoeing. Lan. Did I ask for shoes? I want my horse. Run, fellow, run! Unbarbedâ My lightest harness on his back. Fly, fly! [Exit a Soldier.] [The others pick up the body.] Ask him, I pray you, if he did not lie! Capt. The man is dead, my lord. Lan. (Laughing.) Then do not ask him! [Exeunt Soldiers with the body.] By Jupiter, I shall go mad, I think! [Walks about.] Capt. Something disturbs him. Do you mark the spot Of purple on his brow? [Apart to a Soldier.] Soldier. Then blood must flow. Lan. Boy, boy! (Enter a Page.) My cloak and riding-staff. Quick, quick! How you all lag! (Exit Page.) I ride to Rimini. Skirmish to-morrow. Wait till my returnâ I shall be back at sundown. You shall see What slaughter is then! Capt. Ho! turn out a guard!â Lan. I wish no guard; I ride alone. [ReÃ«nter Page, with a cloak and staff.] [Taking them.] Well done! Thou art a pretty boy.âAnd now my horse! (Enter a Soldier.) Soldier. Pluto is saddledâ Lan. 'T is a damned black lie! Sol. Indeed, my lordâ Lan. O! comrade, pardon me: I talk at random. What, Paolo too,â A boy whom I have trotted on my knee! Poh! I abuse myself by such a thought. Francesca may not love me, may love himâ Indeed she ought; but when an angel comes To play the wanton on this filthy earth, Then I'll believe her guilty. Look you, sir! Am I quite calm? Capt. Quite calm, my lord. Lan. You see No trace of passion on my face?âNo sign Of ugly humors, doubts, or fears, or aught That may disfigure God's intelligence? I have a grievous charge against you, sir, That may involve your life; and if you doubt The candor of my judgment, choose your time: Shall I arraign you now? Capt. Now, if you please. I'll trust my cause to you and innocence At any time. I am not consciousâ Lan. Pshaw! I try myself, not you. And I am calmâ That is your verdictâand dispassionate? Capt. So far as I can judge. Lan. 'T is well, 't is well! Then I will ride to Rimini. Good-night! [Exit.] [The others look after him, amazedly, and exeunt.] SCENE III. Rimini. The Garden of the Castle. Enter Paolo and Francesca. Francesca. Thou hast resolved? Paolo. I 've sworn it. Fran. Ah! you men Can talk of love and duty in a breath; Love while you like, forget when you are tired, And salve your falsehood with some wholesome saw; But we, poor women, when we give our hearts, Give all, lose all, and never ask it back. Paolo. What couldst thou ask for that I have not given? With love I gave thee manly probity, Innocence, honor, self-respect, and peace. Lanciotto will return, and how shall Iâ O! shame, to think of it!âhow shall I look My brother in the face? take his frank hand? Return his tender glances? I should blaze With guilty blushes. Fran. Thou canst forsake me, then, To spare thyself a little bashful pain? Paolo, dost thou know what 't is for me, A womanânay, a dame of highest rankâ To lose my purity? to walk a path Whose slightest slip may fill my ear with sounds That hiss me out to infamy and death? Have I no secret pangs, no self-respect, No husband's look to bear? O! worse than these, I must endure his loathsome touch; be kind When he would dally with his wife, and smile To see him play thy part. Pah! sickening thought! From that thou art exempt. Thou shalt not go! Thou dost not love me! Paolo. Love thee! Standing here, With countless miseries upon my head, I say, my love for thee grows day by day. It palters with my conscience, blurs my thoughts Of duty, and confuses my ideas Of right and wrong. Ere long, it will persuade My shaking manhood that all this is just. Fran. Let it! I'll blazon it to all the world, Ere I will lose thee. Nay, if I had choice, Between our love and my lost innocence, I tell thee calmly, I would dare again The deed which we have done. O! thou art cruel To fly me, like a coward, for thy ease. When thou art gone, thou 'lt flatter thy weak heart With hopes and speculations; and thou 'lt swear I suffer naught, because thou dost not see. I will not live to bear it! Paolo. Die,â't were best; 'T is the last desperate comfort of our sin. Fran. I'll kill myself! Paolo. And so would I, with joy; But crime has made a craven of me. O! For some good cause to perish in! Something A man might die for, looking in God's face; Not slinking out of life with guilt like mine Piled on the shoulders of a suicide! Fran. Where wilt thou go? Paolo. I care not; anywhere Out of this Rimini. The very things That made the pleasures of my innocence Have turned against me. There is not a tree, Nor house, nor church, nor monument, whose face Took hold upon my thoughts, that does not frown Balefully on me. From their marble tombs My ancestors scowl at me; and the night Thickens to hear their hisses. I would pray, But heaven jeers at it. Turn where'er I will, A curse pursues me. Fran. Heavens! O, say not so! I never cursed thee, love; I never moved My little finger, ere I looked to thee For my instruction. Paolo. But thy gentleness Seems to reproach me; and, instead of joy, It whispers horror! Fran. Cease! cease! Paolo. I must go. Fran. And I must follow. All that I call life Is bound in thee. I could endure for thee More agonies than thou canst catalogueâ For thy sake, loveâbearing the ill for thee! With thee, the devils could not so contrive That I would blench or falter from my love! Without thee, heaven were torture! Paolo. I must go. [Going.] Fran. O! noâPaoloâdearest!â [Clinging to him.] Paolo. Loose thy hold! 'T is for thy sake, and Lanciotto's; I Am as a cipher in the reckoning. I have resolved. Thou canst but stretch the time. Keep me to-day, and I will fly to-morrowâ Steal from thee like a thief. [Struggles with her.] Fran. Paoloâloveâ Indeed, you hurt me!âDo not use me thus! Kill me, but do not leave me. I will laughâ A long, gay, ringing laughâif thou wilt draw Thy pitying sword, and stab me to the heart! (Enter Lanciotto behind.) Nay, then, one kiss! Lanciotto. (Advancing between them) Take it: 't will be the last. Paolo. Lo! Heaven is just! Fran. The last! so be it. [Kisses Paolo.] Lan. Ha! Dare you these tricks before my very face? Fran. Why not? I 've kissed him in the sight of heaven; Are you above it? Paolo. Peace, Francesca, peace! Lan. Paoloâwhy, thou sad and downcast man, Look up! I have some words to speak with thee. Thou art not guilty? Paolo. Yes, I am. But she Has been betrayed; so she is innocent. Her father tampered with her. Iâ Fran. 'T is false! The guilt is mine. Paolo was entrapped By love and cunning. I am shrewder far Than you suspect. Paolo. Lanciotto, shut thy ears; She would deceive thee. Lan. Silence, both of you! Is guilt so talkative in its defence? Then, let me make you judge and advocate In your own cause. You are not guilty? Paolo. Yes. Lan. Deny itâbut a wordâsay no. Lie, lie! And I'll believe. Paolo. I dare not. Lan. Lady, you? Fran. If I might speak for himâ Lan. It cannot be: Speak for yourself. Do you deny your guilt? Fran. No! I assert it; butâ Lan. In heaven's name, hold! Will neither of you answer no to me? A nod, a hint, a sign, for your escape. Bethink you, life is centred in this thing. Speak! I will credit either. No reply? What does your crime deserve? Paolo. Death. Fran. Death to both Lan. Well said! You speak the law of Italy; And by the dagger you designed for me, In Pepe's hand,âyour bravo? Paolo. It is false! If you received my dagger from his hand, He stole it. Lan. There, sweet heaven, I knew! And now You will deny the rest? You see, my friends, How easy of belief I have become!â How easy 't were to cheat me! Paolo. No; enough! I will not load my groaning spirit more; A lie would crush it. Lan. Brother, once you gave Life to this wretched piece of workmanship, When my own hand resolved its overthrow. Revoke the gift. [Offers to stab himself.] Paolo. (Preventing him.) Hold, homicide! Lan. But think, You and Francesca may live happily, After my death, as only lovers can. Paolo. Live happily, after a deed like this! Lan. Now, look ye! there is not one hour of life Among us three. Paolo, you are armedâ You have a sword, I but a dagger: see! I mean to kill you. Fran. (Whispers Paolo.) Give thy sword to me. Paolo. Away! thou 'rt frantic! I will never lift This wicked hand against thee. Lan. Coward, slave! Art thou so faint? Does Malatesta's blood Run in thy puny veins? Take that! [Strikes him.] Paolo. And more: Thou canst not offer more than I will bear. Lan. Paolo, what a craven has thy guilt Transformed thee to! Why, I have seen the time When thou 'dst have struck at heaven for such a thing! Art thou afraid? Paolo. I am. Lan. O! infamy! Can man sink lower? I will wake thee, though:â Thou shalt not die a coward. See! look here! [Stabs Francesca.] Fran. O!âO!â [Falls.] Paolo. Remorseless man, dare you do this, And hope to live? Die, murderer! [Draws, rushes at him, but pauses.] Lan. Strike, strike! Ere thy heart fail. Paolo. I cannot. [Throws away his sword.] Lan. Dost thou see Yon bloated spiderâhideous as myselfâ Climbing aloft, to reach that wavering twig? When he has touched it, one of us must die. Here is the dagger.âLook at me, I say! Keep your eyes from that woman! Look, think, choose!â Turn here to me: thou shalt not look at her! Paolo. O, heaven! Lan. 'T is done! Paolo. (Struggling with him.) O! Lanciotto, hold! Hold, for thy sake! Thou wilt repent this deed. Lan. I know it. Fran. (Rising.) Help!âO! murder!âhelp, help, help! [She totters towards them, and falls.] Lan. Our honor, boy! [Stabs Paolo, he falls.] Fran. Paolo! Paolo. Hark! she calls. I pray thee, brother, help me to her side. [Lanciotto helps him to Francesca.] Lan. Why, there! Paolo. God bless thee! Lan. Have I not done well? What were the honor of the Malatesti, With such a living slander fixed to it? Cripple! that 's somethingâcuckold! that is damned! You blame me? Paolo. No. Lan. You, lady? Fran. No, my lord. Lan. May God forgive you! We are even now: Your blood has cleared my honor, and our name Shines to the world as ever. Paolo. O!âO!â Fran. Love, Art suffering? Paolo. But for thee. Fran. Here, rest thy head Upon my bosom. Fie upon my blood! It stains thy ringlets. Ha! he dies! Kind saints, I was first struck, why cannot I die first? Paolo, wake!âGod's mercy! wilt thou go Aloneâwithout me? Prithee, strike again! Nay, I am betterâloveânowâO! [Dies.] Lan. (Sinks upon his knees.) Great heaven! Malatesta. (Without.) This way, I heard the cries. (Enter, with Guido, Attendants, etc.) Guido. O! horrible! Mal. O! bloody spectacle! Where is thy brother? Lan. So Cain was asked. Come here, old men! You shrink From two dead bodies and a pool of bloodâ You soldiers, too! Come here! [Drags Malatesta and Guido forward.] Mal. O!âO!â Lan. You groan! What must I do, then? Father, here it is,â The blood of Guido mingled with our own, As my old nurse predicted. And the spot Of her infernal baptism burns my brain Till reason shudders! Down, upon your knees! Ay, shake them harder, and perchance they'll wake. Keep still! Kneel, kneel! You fear them? I shall prowl About these bodies till the day of doom. Mal. What hast thou done? Gui. Francesca!âO! my child! Lan. Can howling make this sight more terrible? Peace! You disturb the angels up in heaven, While they are hiding from this ugly earth. Be satisfied with what you see. You two Began this tragedy, I finished it. Here, by these bodies, let us reckon up Our crimes together. Why, how still they lie! A moment since, they walked, and talked, and kissed! Defied me to my face, dishonored me! They had the power to do it then; but now, Poor souls, who'll shield them in eternity? Father, the honor of our house is safe: I have the secret. I will to the wars, And do more murders, to eclipse this one. Back to the battles; there I breathe in peace; And I will take a soldier's honor back.â Honor! what 's that to me now? Ha! ha! ha! [Laughing.] A great thing, father! I am very ill. I killed thy son for honor: thou mayst chide. O God! I cannot cheat myself with words! I loved him more than honorâmore than lifeâ This man, Paoloâthis stark, bleeding corpse! Here let me rest, till God awake us all! [Falls on Paolo's body.]</field>

Marsio, A wealthy merchant. Pietro Rogo, His friend. Pulti, Servant to Marsio. Costanza, Daughter to the Marquis. Filippia, Her cousin. Marchioness di Tiburzzi, Mother to Costanza. A Priest, a Notary, Guests, Servants, &amp;c. Scene, Tuscany. ACT I. SCENE I. An Apartment in the Marquis di Tiburzzi's Castle. Enter the Marquis and Marchioness di Tiburzzi. Marquis. Why urge forever Marsio's rich estate? Wealth is not sovereign. Should his money sprout, And yield a thousand-fold, it could not change Its master's nature. In the glare of gold Unnumbered blemishes oft come to light, That had been better hidden in beggar's rags. Marchioness. What faults has he? Marq. It matters not. March. Why not? Marq. If I dislike the man, the end is gained Without a summing of antipathies. March. But should Costanza love him? Marq. Bless me, madam! Am I an oracle? Your questions reach Beyond my thinking. March. Stranger things have been. The maids of Greece, for all their dainty tastes, Gambolled with Satyrs. Men can never know The shifting fancies of a woman's heart. Some love the outer, some the inner man, And some the garniture which fortune gives; Some love to rule, others to be enslaved; Some love for pity, some affect the bold; Some on entreaty, others from sheer spite And sturdy opposition, will consume With three-fold fire. This slender bodkin's point Is ample basis for a woman's love. Marq. Not for Costanza's. Do not wrong our daughter With empty fables, nor impute to her The melting weakness of all womankind. If she should loveâPoh! poh! I squander breath; The thought is monstrous. March. Pray, what see you, sir, In signore Marsioâthink him what you mayâ To banish him beyond the pale of love? He is not handsome! Well, and what of that? These girls have apes for playthings. Cannot talk? She'll slit his tongue, and busy her for hours With her new human magpie. Here 's a husband To banish Maltese cats and singing-birds! What if she love? Marq. Her love would sanctify More vice than Marsio's little soul can hold.â But this is idle. March. Now, what do you mean? First, Marsio's blemishes; next, your dislikes; Then, Marsio's vices, and his little soul! Why do you hate him? Marq. Hate is not the word: I would not choose him for my daughter's husband. First, his mean birth.â March. Ho! pause we at his birth. Did his low birth beget his character? I hold you, sir, he is so nobly minded That he will pick an empress for his dam, If you give choice. Marq. Like still engenders like: 'T is nature's law. The rugged mountain horse Breeds not the silk-skinned barb; the shaggy cur Litters no fine-limbed greyhounds. It may take Whole ages of ancestral blood, to crown A long-drawn race with one true gentleman. Think you his peddling stock can shape a mate For her whose fathers, at great CÃ¦sar's voice, Out-flew the conquering eagles? March. There it is! CÃ¦sar and all his legions! We have stood A hungry siege from him for many a day. Would he had strangled at his birth, With all his captains! Marq. Why this argument? I have heard ten thousand, in my time, yet never Knew one wry notion straightened by them all. What would you? March. Why not ask me that before The matter smothered in the argument? Marq. Speak; I attend you. March. Should Costanza's eyes Have found some merit, unobserved by you, In signore Marsioâshould it so have wrought Upon her woman's fancy as to gain, In CÃ¦sar's spite, that precious heart of hersâ Would you oppose her choice? Marq. Oppose her choice Why, you amaze me. Have you seen good grounds For such a question? March. I have seen enough. I have observed kind looks from Marsio's eyes By echoing blushes answered from her cheeks; I haveâLord, Lord! what have I not observed?â Sufficient to have bred a plague of love, If love were catching. Marq. This is very strange. March. No; 't is as old as Adam. Maids will love, And fathers will not see it. From these signs, Knowing our daughter's happiness might hang Upon your voice, I would forestall her grief, By timely checks, ere love has grown a habit; Or, should you wish, confirm her doubting heart By your full sanction. Marq. Wonderful indeed! She fancy Marsio! Had I been asked, I'd said she shunned him. March. No unusual trick Of love-sick girls.âBut here Costanza comes. Leave her to meânay; if you question her, You'll scorch her words in blushes. Marq. As you will. You are wrong, believe me. She has ever borne So plain a heart to me, so dutiful, So zealous to fulfil my wish as never To question of its justiceâyet such acts Performing not with the cold hand of duty, But with the fiery eagerness of loveâ That I shall feel some twinge of jealousy, If she has ousted me from my fair seat, Henceforth a stranger's, without common notice. Question, but do not vex her. I would rather Your keen suspicion had o'ershot its mark, Than that my daughter should have wasted love Upon thisâthisâ March. Noble, thrice noble man; Half deified by her subliming love! Marq. I have no heart for jesting. [Exit.] March. Nor for acting: Your feeble nature shifts the deed on me. (Enter Costanza.) Costanza. Where went my father? March. To concoct some scheme About a penny-worth of musty bread. It takes more work, to live this starving way, Than would be used in earning us a fortune. But we are noble, very noble, daughter; We have some centuries of rich, proud blood, On which we live, and therefore need not labor. We feed, like fleshy men, upon our fat,â Self-eating cannibals. Cos. Fasting has its mirth, Feasting its sorrow. March. Ay, ay; much the mirth We see the death's head grinning. Cos. True, my mother; Death has a whisper in the maddest mirth Of us poor mortals. March. You are gloomy, child. Cos. No more than usual. 'T is a gloomy thing To see a father, so deserving love, Bowed with a load of vulgar, petty caresâ Too mean to tax the housewife of a hindâ That nip and pinch him into actual life, Giving his aching mind no dreaming pause 'Twixt day and day. March. Of all disgusting things Commend me to our old, familiar friend, Proud poverty. Cos. Would I could lighten it! March. And so you can. Cos. I! how? March. I trow, my daughter, You'll be no victim, no burnt-offering, No chattel, traded for your father's peace: No; let us starve, drown, hangâwhy, what care you? You have a heart, forsooth, a virgin heart, Not to be hung on matrimonial shambles! In faith, you are right. Cos. What is your purpose, mother? March. There 's signore Marsio; do you fancy him? Cos. I never weighed my feelings for him. March. No? But he loves you. Cos. For that I owe him thanks. March. Nowâdo you mark me?âshould you marry him, We are rich at once. Cos. That never crossed my mind. March. It has ours. Cos. âOursâ? March. Your father's and my own. Cos. My father spoke of this? March. Just ere he left. Cos. Does he desire me to wed Marsio? March. You know your father far too well for that. He would not have you wed for his sake only; Would not persuade you, press you, and so forth. With such spasmodic eagerness, with such A trembling lip, and clutching of the hands, He says these things, that I, who know his ways, With half a thought can fathom his desire. Cos. Which is?â March. That we should want no longer. Cos. How! Wed Marsio? March. Not unless with your consent. Well, would you try it? Tell your father, then, You love rich Marsio, whose countless wealth Can bribe his sorrow, ease his shaking mind, And make his days lapse calmly to their endâ Marsio, whose golden finger puts to flight Duns, bailiffs, tradesmen, all the brood of want, And makes a jest of every former grief To talk of in foul weather. Nay, my child; Breathe not a word of this: say simply thusâ I love good Marsio; I would be his wife. You'll see the issue. Cos. Signore Marsio stands Far better with my father than I thought. Doubtless there is some good in Marsioâ In Marsioâin Marsioâ March. Well, well! Why do you dwell upon his name? Cos. There seems A strangeness in it, I ne'er marked before. March. You will attempt this little loving ruse? Cos. Mother, I dare not tamper with the love My father bears me. March. Poh! 't is but a trial. You need not marry Marsio, for all. Cos. This I will say: if to my father's mind Marsio appear a proper husband for me, And signore Marsio should incline to me, I will accept him. March. Bravely spoken, child! I know you do this for your father's sake; And 't is a beautiful, most saint-like act, On which the angels smile. May Heaven reward you! Then, in Italy, marrying is one thing, Loving is another. Cos. What did you say? March. You will find out ere long. But, hark, Costanza; If you are resolute, let every action, Which falls beneath your father's eyes, appear Full of kind thoughts for signore Marsio. Cos. I feel but kindly towards him. O, my mother, If he, or any manâa clownâa foolâ More hideous than the nightmare, crueller than The ragged tooth of famineâ March. Tut, tut! daughter, Marsio is none of these. Cos. I hope not, madam. Doubtless, I'll learn to love him very soon. It seems to me, duty would tutor love, At the first moment my poor father smiled. Marsio must know the terms. March. What need of that? When did love ever chaffer about terms? I'll tell him, if 't will ease you. Cos. Let us go. My father's word must sanction this high treason Against the sweet dominion of god Love.â You see I am merry, mother; am I not? March. Yes; very merry. Cos. As we go along, Give me a catalogue of all our ills. Tell o'er my father's sufferings; then rehearse The royal qualities of Marsio's gold. How do you think my father's face would look With one bright smile upon it? Do you know, 'T is a long, dreary age since I beheld What you might call a smile upon his face? I need to hear these things. Think you this marriage Would be no sin against my better nature? March. Heaven counsels filial love. Cos. Yes; you shall feast, And wear gay clothes, and build our shattered house, And brush the cobwebs from our ancestry,â That seem to suffer like decay with us,â And there shall be no name in Italy Prouder than the Tiburzzi! Did you think, When you first saw me lying in my cradle, An impotent, cross bantling, that one day Your poor Costanza could do all these things? I know you did notâha, ha! (Laughing.) Woe is me! Tears are close neighbors to such mirth as mine. [Exeunt.] SCENE II Another Apartment in the Castle. Enter Marsio. Marsio. If I know moneyâHeaven knows I shouldâ They must come to it. Needy, needy, say you? I have known the needy murder for a ducat: Lo! here are millions; and but for a name. A very ancient, very noble name, I grant; but somewhat damaged in the keeping.â Easily patched, however, easily patched with gold. Join Marsio's riches to Tiburzzi's name, And who can stand against them? But the name, Ungilt and naked, is an empty noise, Which Marsio's goldâMarsio's hard, solid goldâ As well can purchase in the daily market Where parents vend their marriageable wares. Why should I doubt? There 's nothing like a heart To chaffer for. I never bought a heart. Men say I want one. Ha, ha! how they lie! [Laughing.] 'T is a great rock on which all commerce wrecks. There is no rival, no keen moneyed man, To weigh his scrapings 'gainst my topmost bid; So says the MarchionessâO, pardon meâ Our mother, I should say; though ne'ertheless A marchioness for all that, Costanza dear.â Conny, and Con, and Stanza, when you please me, Besides a hundred other sweet, pet names, To come up on occasion. Ha! our mother! And all one splendor with a blaze of smiles! (Enter the Marchioness.) I guess your meaning Marchioness. Hist! the Marquis comes. Show no surprise; one doubt may mar the whole. Hear, ere you speak. Mar. I am all ears, no tongue. (Enter the Marquis.) Marquis. Welcome, friend Marsio! Mar. âFriend Marsio!â Well spoken, friend Tiburzzi! (Aside.) Gracious sir, Your proud addition to my humble nameâ March. Stoop not too low, or you may never rise. [Apart to Marsio.] Mar. âMy deeds shall ratify. March. Turned just in time. [Aside.] Marq. Frankness is bestâ Mar. The coin of honesty! March. For Heaven's sake, peace! Art talking for a wager? [Apart to Marsio.] Marq. Signore, it seems my daughter and yourself, Unknown to meâand therein much I blame youâ Have leagued your heartsâ Mar. What! sheâ March. O, silence, silence! [Apart to Marsio.] Marq. You would excuse her, signore, with such reasons As, to the partial wits of lovers, seem Both law and right; on me they fall full coldly. That love, which breeds such ecstasy in you, To me is breach of trust. But let that pass. Mar. Against your wordâ Marq. Do not deceive yourself; Hearts will make way against ten thousand words. Mar. Are you so wilful? Forward, then. [Aside.] March. You see, My lord but seeks our daughter's happiness. Marq. Yes; take her, sir. No foolish whim of mine Shall stand 'twixt heart and heart. Mar. â'Twixt heart and heart!â What does he mean? Well, I will swallow all. [Aside.] Your frank approval stifles my poor thanks. Let me repay your frankness with its equal. No man, who is your friend, has wanted eyes To see how, day by day, that ancient wealth, Which once so proudly propped your mighty name, Has slipped beneath the thing it should support; Till all the glories of this noble house Seem tottering down to ruin and oblivion.â Nay, do not chafe; I cannot choose but know it. Marq. âKnow it, know it!â the very beggars know it, And, with unbegging laughter, pass me by! My name 's the jest of all this mocking land.â The blind, dumb, deaf, conceive it! Idiots, jays, Parrots, have wit to say, âPoor, poor Tiburzzi!â Mar. I would not ape them. Marq. O, 't is nothing new: Heaven makes us feel our chastenings commonly. Of all realities, the reallest thingâ Of all heart-sickening, spirit-killing thingsâ That can unnerve, unsex, and bring to naught The proudest purposes of stubborn strength, Making brawn Hercules a whining babyâ The very top and crown is poverty! It feeds on hope, it glories in despair, It saps the brave foundations of the will, It turns our simple faith to blasphemy, It gnaws its way into the very spirit, And with a weary siege starves out the soul, Sending to judgment that bright denizen So changed in hue, so fallen from its estate, That Heaven, in the poor, warped, and shivering thing, Can scarcely recognize its handiwork! Mar. My purse shall aid you. Use it, without stint, In common with me. Marq. Pshaw! I need it not. I and my wants have grown such intimates That 't would seem strange to part us. Prisoned men Have wept at parting from their old, dull cells: So custom, I doubt not, may reconcile A father to an unconfiding child. I can take naught of him. [Aside. Walks apart.] March. Urge him no more: His mind is troubled with an idle fancy About Costanza's want of trust in him. He has scarce patience, now, to speak with her: But he will change, next moon. [Apart to Marsio.] Marq. Pray treat her well, Pray treat her well, good signore Marsio: One sin makes not a sinner. She is worth it;â Yes, yes, although she 'd not confide in me. But then, you know, we fathers have no vows Like you hot lovers; have no skill, to show The depths and heights of customary feeling, With high-spiced words. Love grows a gray-beard in us, And lacks the prattle of the wingÃ©d boy. Pray treat her well. Mar. I'll have no other care. A precious store ne'er wants a zealous ward. Marq. Let not that promise rust. March. Our daughter waits Signore, go on before. What, what, so tardy! Does your love use a herald? Mar. By your leave, then. [Exit.] March. Stands it not as I said? Marq. Is she my daughter? March. If she is mine. Marq. That strain I cannot doubt: There the blood cries. March. If it amuses you, Pray rail away. There 's many an out-door saint Blows off his wolfish humors at his wife, And paces forth a lamb. Marq. Love Marsio?âNo! What, sell herself?âpah! pah! Come, let us in. This shivering on the brink is worse than drowning. I'll link these lovers. When the knot is tied, The galling process of the action stops, And I may rub my fretted hands at ease. I'll not be tortured.âMarry, marry shall they; And sooner than they think! Still waiting, madam? Heavens! what a new Tiburzzi fortune sends! [Exeunt] SCENE III. Another Apartment in the Castle. Enter Costanza and Filippia. Filippia. Would I wed Marsio? Would I wed theâ Costanza. There! Your common phrases have sufficient strength, Without appealing to another world. Fil. Would I wed Marsio? (Laughing.) Why, 't is something new To hear you jesting, cousin! Would I wed A man who ever thrusts his money forth As his best quality?âa man who feels No inward stir of man's nobility, But, like the poor ass with his golden freight, Is worth just what he carries? Then he has A wicked, subtle, and consuming devil, Pent in the corners of his red-rimmed eyes, That 's always dodging, like a serpent's tongue, Angry but fearful. Cos. What a character! Fil. 'T is Marsio to an eye-lash. Cos. Your wild tongue Ever outruns your stricter meaning, cousin. I shall wed Marsio. Fil. What a woful sigh! That is the tone Gonsalvo gave me, when, Tearing his tattered ruffâworn for the nonceâ He cried, âI shall drink poison!â But he did not. Cos. But I will. Fil. Drink poison? Cos. No; wed Marsio. Fil. The poison in another shape. Cos. Fie! fie! Are quibbling jests the best advice you give? Fil. 'T was jest chase jest. You are not serious? Cos. Indeed I am. Fil. Then here 's a weeping matter. Cos. Marsio has made an offer for my hand, Which I intend accepting. Fil. O, you shall not, You shall not, by my faith! Cos. By mine I shall. Fil. I hate him, hate him! Cos. I 'm not jealous of you. Fil. Who 's jesting, now? Cos. You 've taught me your own tongue. Fil. I see through this. You marry that base wretchâ That sallow, spider-legged, bow-shouldered wretchâ That man of moneyâthat great human purseâ Thatâthatâ Cos. Hie forward, forward, cousin dear! I would not have you keep such humors to yourself; They might breed inward danger. Fil. Out upon you! Your father's wants have driven you to this end. You should not dareâI say, you should not dare, If famine wrestled with us throat to throatâ Offer the holiest portion of your nature To this gold calf. 'T will have a grievous answer, One day, Costanza; for 't is mortal sin To strike at the dim instincts of the heart. Why are you weeping? Cousin, dear Costanza, The sun shines upon nothing that I love As I love you. That 's generous; smile again.â But, lo! the gentle lover! lo! sweet Marsio! Dragging his fingers o'er the entrance wall Like a belated school-boy! Cos. Cousin, cousin! Fil. He sees youâblushes! Ay: by my faith, blushes, Through all his leathern skin, from ear to chin! Come, that is cheering! Marsio can blush. Cos. Do leave, Filippia. Fil. I! I dare not leave. Look to your trade, Costanza. Push him sharply. He'll get the better of you. I'll be witness; And if he slip one tittle, we will close Upon him roundly. Tell him hearts are dear This season; the supply of maiden hearts Has dwindled down; he may have widows' cheaper; Old maidens' for the asking. Money 's plenty, And begs for usury. Nay, mark these things; He'll trick you else. We must protect our interest. Cos. Have done! have done! (Enter Marsio.) Good welcome, sir! Marsio. I thank you. A fair day, lady! Fil. Dare the knave say that, With such a falling-weather face? Perhaps, Some day, he'll find I 'm not invisible,â The ill-bred cur! [Aside.] Mar. May we converse alone? Fil. Better and better! He has seen my ears; I'll show my tongue, next. [Aside. Seats herself apart.] Cos. Signore Marsioâ Mar. Yes, lady, yes.âI have a mortal dread Of girls and babies. [Aside.] Cos. You would speak with me? Mar. Ay; if I could. [Aside.] Has not your motherâPshaw! I came to lay my fortune at your feet; And I will hold it doubled fifty times, If you bestow one smile upon the act. Fil. Prolific smile! [Aside.] Cos. Sir, if my simple smileâ Fil. Or my compounded laughter, shout on shout. [Aside.] Cos. This is deceit. [Aside.] Mar. O, horror, what a strait! Never a word! Her silence will upset me. Would she might fall to cursing! [Aside.] Fil. Conny, dear, A million, Conny; 't is well worth a million. Mar. What means yon lady? Fil. You shall see, anon. [Aside.] Cos. 'T would pose my cousin, signore Marsio, To show a meaning in one half she says. Mar. Your servant, lady. [Bowing.] Fil. Of the latest date. [Curtseying.] Mar. Here 's my excuse. [Pointing to Costanza.] Fil. A fair excuse, indeed: I know no fairer, sir. Mar. I said not so: You might teach schoolmen, if you knew yourself. Fil. Well done! We get on bravely. [Aside.] Mar. Gentle lady, Our business waits. [To Costanza.] Fil. There the mart speaks again. [Aside.] Cos. Has not my mother told you of the terms. On which I listen to your suit? Mar. She hasâ O, golden chance! here comes the Marchioness! I'd have gone mad, ere long. [Aside.] (Enter the Marquis and Marchioness.) Marquis. Daughter, Costanza, Do you love signore Marsio? Cos. I hope To love him better, sir. Marchioness. Well said, well said! Love 's but a baby, Hymen is a boy; He grows apace in wedlock.âWell said, daughter! This coyness is the privilege of maids: Do not compel her to a public blush. [Apart to the Marquis, who walks up the stage, gloomily.] Cos. How sad my father seems! March. 'T is very natural; He parts from you; but it is like the parting Of a young twig, that, when it sunders, adds A vigorous life to the old parent tree. Think of that, daughter. Cos. But the twig will wither.â So be it, though, if it revive the tree. Marq. You would wed signore Marsio? Cos. I will wed, With your approval, signore Marsio. Mar. It irks me much that you must bare your heart;â Both irks and pleases. March. Are these questions decent? [Apart to the Marquis.] Fil. She changes words, and never answers straight. She 's mad for misery. There 's something wrong. If I but daredâI willâ(Aside.) My lord, my lordâ Marq. She has declared it. Take her, signore, take her! And may she never want the duteous love A wife should show a husband! May she lean, In an unbroken confidence, upon The upright manhood she has found in you; And may you never know what bitterness Burns in the silent chambers of a heart That loves, yet cannot trust! God bless you, child!â Yea, give your husband all you held from me! [Aside.] ACT II. SCENE I. The Park of the Marquis di Tiburzzi. Enter Juranio and Salvatore. Juranio. Whose grounds are these? Salvatore. The Marquis di Tiburzzi'sâ A sorry sequel to an ancient stock, Whose wide dominion once outstretched our sight. Alas! for him, poor man, malicious fortune Threw all the choicest of her random smiles Upon the wrong end of his famous race, And now mocks him with what his fathers were. Ju. A pretty place! Some heritage of beauty Yet harbors here. Mark how the clustered blossoms Star the dark back-ground of yon shady wood. Sal. O! yes; but mark how jealous avarice Has shorn the chiefest saplings to the root. Ju. Yet spared us every flower. Praise be to Heaven! Their beauty is not marketable. See, A living bower, a bower of growing vines, All carpeted with last year's fallen leaves! Sal. A thrifty thought! The very dead are used. That hint was stolen from Egypt, where they burn Their spicy ancestors. 'T were a proud thing, To sit down at a fire of Ptolemies, With Cleopatra for a back-log. Ju. Ugh! You would put out the harmony of heaven With your great sprawling jokes. The hand of taste, Making best use of few materials, Is here. Sal. The hand of woman. Ju. Worse and worse! I'll fly you, shortly. Sal. 'T would confess your devil, To fly at holy names. Why do you shun These dainty blossoms of humanity With such stern care?âSo ho! run, run for life! There go two maidsâtwo full-blown, dangerous maidsâ Hide you, sir modesty! Ju. You know them maids? Sal. I take them so on credit. Ju. Save you, save you! Good lady-broker, you will one day fail From such long credits. Sal. See, they make this way. Here comes the goddess of your living bower. Ju. Which one? Sal. The shorter. Ju. No; the taller one. Sal. How know you that? Ju. I trace her little fingers In the soft curvings of each vine. Sal. Ho! ho! (Laughing.) Ju. I'll bet my Arabâsaddle, spurs, and allâ Against your empty laugh, those cunning girls Are plotting to ensnare some luckless man: I see such malice in your small one's eyes. Sal. Done! Ju. Done!âCome hide. Sal. A mere excuse for running, You arrant fly-frock! Ju. Here, behind the bower. [They secrete themselves.] (Enter Costanza and Filippia.) Costanza. Press me no more; my motives are my own. You grant me judgment? Filippia. More than you grant me. You have some cloudy fancy in your brain, That needs but airing,âsome weak, flimsy notion, That common reason would dry up at once. Cos. You rate me poorly, cousin. Fil. There again! You would be off. Stick to the text, Costanza. Do you love Marsio? Cos. Would I wed him else? Fil. You dare not answer strictly. Cos. Why then ask? Fil. I know you do not. 'T is not in your nature To fall so meanly. O! be warned in time. The twin-born heart to whom you owe allegiance, To whom, perforce, you must surrender love, Will track you out at last. How fearful, then, To perish piecemeal with a smothered passion, OrâI will not repeat it: 't was a story Old at the flood. Cos. Here I dare answer strictly. If you will not allow me Marsio, At least, I love no other. Fil. But you willâ Nay, never raise your browsâyou will, I say, Fall in a frenzy of outrageous love With some stern, mulish creature, like yourself, Who swears he'll wed the blackest blackamoor, And willâthat will he!âthough the heavens should fall! Tell me, Costanza,âtell me, darling cousin,â What are your motives in this strange affair? Cos. Then will you cease your torments? Fil. Ay; and vow To keep good counsel. Cos. Nor by word or deed Again oppose my purpose? Fil. Yes, to that; But 't is a bitter contract. Cos. Let us walk: The story is a long one. [They walk up the stage.] Ju. Salvatore, This eavesdropping is scarcely honorable. Sal. What a fine moral sense! Just as you lose The last faint whisper of their pretty talk, Up starts indignant honor. Ju. Ah! her voice Held honor spell-bound. Did you mark, with me, How the low music trickled from her lips? All heaven was listening to her, why not we? Sal. Which one set heaven agog? Ju. The taller one. Sal. The small one spoke the more. Ju. More, but less valued. The other's phrases served to bind together, As baser metal solders sovereign gold, The broken links of her harmonious thoughts. Sal. Zounds! are you mad? Ju. I know not what I am: I am something I was not an hour ago. Sal. Unhappy idiot! Ju. See, see, she walks! Sal. A wonderful exploit! Ju. I must address her. Sal. Fellow, there are two. To my unbiassed eyes, The smaller is the fairer. Let us leave, As partial penance for our vulgar fault. Will you not come? Ju. No; I must speak to her. Sal. That were ill-bred. Ju. I'll frame new codes of manners. Fair lady, by your leaveâ [Advancing to Costanza.] Sal. Nay, be not startled. 'T is but a simple kinsman of my own, A poor brain-darkened lunatic; but harmless, Quite harmless to a lady. Pray you know him; The Count Juranioâonce a wiser man. [Juranio bows.] Ju. And here his cousin, signore Salvatore, [Salvatore bows.] A world-wide jester, a professed buffoon; The globe 's his bauble, all mankind his mark; Each word of his a jest, or meant for such. A cunning ferret after doubtful phrases, A subtle reasoner upon groundless proofs, A deep inquirer into shallowness, A dangerous friend, a harmless enemy; His own best jest, oftener laughed at than with. Weigh well your words, give him no cavilling point, And you are safe. Fil. Two weighty characters! Cos. What mean you, gentlemen?âYou should be such By dress, if not by manners. Ju. WeâIâIâ What would we, Salvatore? Sal. We would know The way to town. Fil. Why, all the steeples stare Above yon hill. Sal. Ah! yes.âTrueâtrue, indeedâ I seeâWhat would we, Count Juranio? There is an awful mystery here, which I Would fain explain, if we might meet again. [Apart to Filippia.] Fil. A mystery! How, meet me? I cannot tell But I may often ramble hereabout. [Apart to Salvatore.] Sal. Our ways are doubtful: odder things have been Than two chance meetings. [Apart to Filippia.] Ju. Has my tongue strayed off? [Aside.] Lady, from that small spring, the human heart, Arise a thousand swelling impulses, Each one a mystery to the sober brain: 'T were vain to ask why we do thus and thus, Why crush that good intent, and rear this wrong, While the poor reason, that would fain inquire, Is impotent to rule. 'T was such an impulse Drove me to what I did; which, being done, I forge no false excuse, but simply beg Your gentlest censure. Cos. Sir, a fault confessed Pardons itself one half. I will not grudge A full forgiveness, if you ask it of me. Ju. I do, most humbly. It is not my wont To sue for breach of manners. Sal. That I swear! He was the flower of distant etiquette To all things feminine. Cos. Nor are my manners Of the sour, formal cast that freezes back The generous feelings of o'erflowing nature, And bars the way between our hearts and lips; NorânorâIndeed I know not what I sayâ I talk at random. Pray you, leave me, sir: You trifle with me. Ju. Lady, are you just? Cos. O, heaven! I am not; neither to myself, Nor those who own my duty. Say no more; But leave me, leave me! Ju. I obey; how sadly! May we not meet once more? Cos. No; never, never! [Exit with Filippia.] Sal. Gods! we are all mad together! Ju. âNever, never!â Sal. You lost your Arab. Ju. Did I?ââNever, never!â Sal. Ay; but you did. Ju. 'T is granted.ââNever, never!â [Exit. Salvatore following him amazedly.] SCENE II. The House of Marsio. Enter Marsio. Marsio. Where I had purposed to court, beg, and bribeâ To out-scheme Machiavelli, and so tug Against the disadvantages of birth and rank, That, by sheer strength and resolute force of will, I hoped to barely conquerâthey at once Thrust the fair prize in my astonished arms, Blow all my crafty net-works to the wind, And half undo me with sheer wonderment. They say she loves me.âHum! I'll think of that: It looks suspicious.âNonsense, Marsio! Hold up thy head! Did they not, upon 'Change, Marvel at thy advancement? Ah! did not That sneering beggar, Volio, who can boast Some half-score drops of gentle bloodâ Who never condescendedâbless his stars!â To speak with thee;âdid not that ragged wretchâ Ha! ha! I watched him from behind a pillar, Close, very close, as 't was rehearsed to himâ Did not even he turn blue with choking envy? Swore 't was a lying scandal; but no less Bowed his majestic forehead to his belt When next we met? Lord bless us! and he spoke, So sweetly spoke, in such a winning whisper, Of the âdear Marquis,â of the âdear Marchioness; Hoped the fair lady of my heart was well; When would my marriage be?â And then he took So grave and formal a farewell of me!â The devil claw him! (Enter Pietro Rogo.) How now, Master Rogo? Rogo. So! How now, Master Marsio? Men have said Your grand betrothal has upset your brains:â By heaven! I think so. âMaster Rogo,â sooth! Why, yesterday 't was âGood friend Pietro;â And âKinsman Pietro;â and âPietro, I have a secret for you!â Out upon you! I thought to hear some folly, but your style Out-fools conceit! Mar. I prithee be not rude; Nor so presume on former fellowshipâ Rogo. Where are your wits? Mar. Cease your blunt manner, sir! Rogo. What? Mar. Cease, I say! Rogo. The world is full of marvels; I myself can dream some stretch of wonder, And they say poets, and such-like madmen, can, By some shrewd knack, make that appear as truth Which really is not; but roll all the poets, All my wild dreams, all the earth's prodigies, In one huge mass, and Marsio makes them tame. Mar. Good Master Rogoâ Rogo. Pietro is my name. No man shall master me. Mar. Pietro, then; Since yesterday, as you observe, a change Has come across me. Yesterday we met As Marsio, the merchant, and his friend: To-day I represent the last great branch Of the Tiburzzi; and as such expect That due observance of my rank and person Which it is but my duty to demand, And is as much your duty to bestow. Rogo. You thrice-dyed fool! With the Tiburzzi's daughter, Did you receive the blood of all the race? Their gentle culture, their refined politeness, Which wins, but never asks, a man's respect? I tell you, Marsio, you have climbed a tower, To make your shameless folly further seen. Come, come, be ruled. Mar. Begone, sir! Leave my house! I wear a sword. Rogo. A lucky thought, my lord,â My bold Tiburzzi! By the devil's beard, I'll try your lordship's hand at noble arts! When we get through with this, we'll run a tilt. Draw! Mar. Will you leave me? Rogo. Draw, my noble sir, Or I will thresh your noble lordship's shins With a good Milan blade. The devil take me, If I endure your airs! I'll make a hole To let discretion in you. Draw, you oaf! [They fight. Rogo drives Marsio round the stage.] Your lordship gives, gives to this vulgar man?â That 's charitable! [Marsio is disarmed.] Now, sir, were it not For the huge sin of surfeiting the devil, With such a lump of folly, I would let Your windy soul out of some ugly gash.â Nay, you 're not off yet. Promise me to be My old, dear friend, Marsio of yesterday, Or I will send that semblance of my friend, Into whose body you have falsely crept, To sup black Pluto!âSwear! or, on my life, Your shrift is short! Mar. Come, come, friend Pietro. Rogo. You are improving. Swear it! Mar. Well, I swear. Rogo. Never to be a lord to me? Mar. No, never. Rogo. Ever to listen to my wholesome counsel, Though it be rugged as the road to heaven; And to receive it, if your candid judgment Can bring no cause against it? Mar. Yes, and yes. Take your cursed rapier from my throat! Rogo. 'T was blessed To your salvation, most ungrateful man. Go up, old Milan: when you are sunned again, May you be umpire in as good a cause! Now of this marriage; is the rumor true? Mar. Ay; have you aught to say? Rogo. Against the fact, Nothing.âThough, in this easy-jogging land, Marriage seems quite superfluous to me:â And the same cause which makes a single state Endurable, should scare us from a wedding. Well, let that go. You are a wealthy man, And must have lineal heirsâeither your own, Or seeming soâundoubtedly, your wife'sâ To squander your slow millions in a day. Mar. Are the sour sneers of an old sapless miser What you call counsel? Rogo. Patience, patience, friend. Who is the maid? Mar. Had my heart rhetoric, 'T would answer in fit phrases. Rogo. Bless my soul! He 's metamorphosed to a first-class lover! You have a tongue, perchance? Mar. The fair Costanzaâ Costanza di Tiburzzi is the nameâ Rogo. They doused her with at baptism. Fair, you say? Mar. Fair asâasâ Rogo. What? Mar. As any thing you choose. Her charms outsoar my fancy; fly your own: Come, Pietro. Rogo. Ecstatic driveller! Fair? I like not fair. The ugly ones are best: They bear the patent of their chastity In their brown skins, in their green, filmy eyes, Their clawish hands, their broad, earth-flattening feet, Their crooked ankles and their camel backs. Without temptation, there can be no sin; But where the fruit is jolly, and hangs out As a ripe challenge to all passers by, Heaven only knows who tastes, who handles it, And who goes harmless past! Mar. Pietro Rogo, Is there one subject under the mad moon Too weak to found an argument upon? I'll venture, with your talents, you can prove, Against all comers, that incontinence Is but a wide benevolence; that murderâ Under the million given circumstances With which your nimble wit shall hedge it inâ Is a humane achievement; theft, an instinct; Cheating, a thrifty thoughtfulness of self; And so forth, on through all the deadly sins. Poh! poh! what stuff you talk! Rogo. Back to our subject. Costanza di Tiburzzi should be daughter To an old dwindled noble of that name: Is it not so? Mar. It is. Rogo. They want your wealth. Mar. And they shall have it! Our long-shadowed name Shall blaze, with a new light, through Italy. Rogo. O, ho! âour name!â My sword crawls in its scabbard. Friend, you have not one generous aim in this; Your own huge pride awakes this forward zeal: But you'll learn wisdom through humility. Mar. How, raven, how? Rogo. A hundred little things Shall make you gnaw your fingers to the quick. You'll haply blunder at the first grand feast: At which Lord So-and-so will titter, titter; And Lady Somebody will simper, simper; And sly Count Nobody, a noted wit, Will wink and wink; while some bluff honest duke Howls out his laughter. Then our father wriggles, And stares straight through a six-foot granite wall; Our mother blushes, and talks violently About the price of spaniels to her neighbors; Our bride hangs down her headâperchance a tear, Like a full dew-drop, gathers on her cheek, And drowns out its carnations. Mar. I will hire The world's opinion till my manners mend. Life is but one long lesson. Rogo. Ah! I fear Your lesson will be paid for in rude coin. Now hear me, Marsio; if you are horn-mad, Wed some fresh country girl, some honest thing, Too big a fool to be a lady sinnerâ Too proud of you to think you aught but perfectâ Too ignorant to know your faults of breedingâ One every way inferior to yourselfâ And I will chime in with your marriage-bell. Mar. You waste your wisdom, Pietro; I'll wed No other than Costanza. [Pulti sings within.] Rogo. Hark! here comes Our merry gossip, Pulti. Let us ask A fool's advice. Babies and naturals Speak, sometimes, by a kind of inspiration. Mar. You will not condescend?â Rogo. 'Sblood! he 's a man! I have no princely notions, like your own, To pull me from my fellows. (Enter Pulti, singing.) Pulti. The devil wriggled, The devil squealed, The devil gave a shout; But Saint Dunstan he Held on stoutly, And put the fiend to rout. Mar. Stop your din! That villain has one long, unending song About a certain devil, who has seen More sad adventures than the Golden Legend Recounts of all its saints. Pul. Hem, hem, hem, hem! Mar. What do you hem at? Pul. I have seen in churches, When the dull preacher would not hem himself, The congregation would hem for him. Rogo. True. What thinks your wisdom of your master's marriage? Pul. Lord! sir, I seldom think; it spoils my talking. I scorn your thoughts; the stealthy, spectral things Smell of the church-yard, and of heaven and hellâ And bygone happiness, and present painâ And barren futures filled with new-made gravesâ And baby-hopes nipped in our nursing armsâ Of all that 's dreary, and of naught that 's bright. They are huge stoppers for a flowing mouth, That still by strangling. Rogo. Have you naught to say? Pul. I'll race my tongue with any man's. I say, My master will be wiser than he 's rich. Rogo. A goodly store of wisdom, that! How, boy? Pul. When he has gathered in his bursting brains All the fantastic humors of a woman, He'll have more thoughts than ducats. Rogo. Marsio, mark: The knave 's a prophet. What is wedlock like? Pul. Much like sin's journey after happiness. We start upon it with a merry heart, Proceed upon it with a sober one, And endâ Rogo. Ah! yes; where end we? Pul. Not at all: We stumble in our graves. Rogo. A gloomy thought. Pul. 'T is not a thought. I lit upon the fact By seeing, and not thinking. For your thinkers Go stumbling headlong in with all the rest, Thinking of all save death. Rogo. Sage doctor Pulti, You shall teach me your doctrines. Pul. I will, sir, In one short rule.âKeep your eyes ever open. Mar. Have you not done? For Pulti will reply Till doomsday break. 'T is not his wonted mood; He 's oftener gay than sad. Pul. 'T is a sad thoughtâ Note, signore Rogo, thinking makes one sadâ To weigh two losses with a single gain. Rogo. Your wit outshoots me. Pul. With a feeble shaft. I, by this marrying, must lose a master; My poor, poor masterâwho may comfort him?â Must lose a servant!âSuch a servant, sir!â So soberâwhen you keep his wine away; So sweetly temperedâwhen you do not cross him; So grave and seemlyâwhen there 's naught to laugh at; So frugalâwhen you give him naught to spend; So every way perfectionâwhere you grow not The carnal apple to assail his Adam. I have lived on these conditions, many a day, The best of slaves. Rogo. But where 's your single gain? Pul. Nay, 't is but half a one: master and man Share it between them.â'T is an untried mistressâ A vast, dim, shadowy, uncertain fear, That may be saint or devil. Mar. Pulti!âdog! Saddle my horses! Pul. For the beggar's ride. Mar. Dare you presume so far upon my kindness, You coarse-grained knave? Pul. Not I; I never trespass On such unstable ground. Rogo. Where do you ride? Mar. Where should a lover ride? Rogo. O, pause at once. All things cry out against this unmeet match: Blood, rank, and breeding, fortune, friends, and tastes, In rigid opposition stand between. You cannot mould these opposites to one; Force them together, and earth's primal chaos Were harmony to their eternal jar. Mar. You could not move me, had you Tully's tongue; Prop heaven with virgin gold, you could not buy me; Summon the damned, with all their terrors on, You could not daunt me!âTo the horses, Pulti! Pul. I am going, sir. [Sings.] These horns were worn, Ere you were born, The grinning devil said; Then take no care, But proudly wearâ Mar. You know this cudgel, sirrah? Pul. Thank you; we 've often met before. His name Is oak; his mother was an acorn. See, I know the family from end to end. You need not introduce us, signore. [Exit.] Mar. Rogo, The aims of my existence have been few, Yet, in the service of the thing I sought, I have offered up my health, my life, my soul. He must be rash, or confident, who stands Between a zealot and his single mark.â My horses, Pulti!âI have set my heart Upon this marriage; let heaven frown or smile, Till I am blasted into nothingness, I will pursue it as if heaven were not!â My horses, knave! Pulti. (Without.) Here, sir. Ho! Lucifer. Rogo. I'll try to cross you for your own advantage, If honest means may prosper. Mar. Well, push on! Choose your own weapons, fight as you think fit; But, Pietro Rogo, when we are at the tugâ When the blood boils, and timid conscience fliesâ When what opposes, with a friendly front, Is not distinguished from an enemyâ Then call for mercy to the prayer-stunned saints, And hope an age of miracles may come, But not to Marsio!âMy horses wait. [Exeunt.] SCENE III. A Room in the Castle of the Marquis di Tiburzzi. Costanza and Filippia. Filippia. Saw him before? Costanza. Yes;âonly once before. Fil. But where, and how? Cos. Can you not call to mind The day our duke was welcomed by the people? Fil. As well as yesterday. Cos. Indeed, indeed! It seems a weary age since then, to me. Among the nobles, who rode nigh the duke, Was one who, in all noble qualities Of port and majesty, rode there supreme: Clad in black velvet, for his father's death; Yet wearing a long plume of ostrich white, As a fit emblem of the general joy. Fil. Lord! you know all about him! Cos. Yesâwhyâyes.â Surely the people talked of him alone. Fil. I was beside you, yet I heard them not. Well, well, go on. Cos. It chanced a beggar's child, A pretty boyâone of those nimble imps That live by miracles 't wixt horses' feet, And under carriage-wheelsâbecame entangled In the unusual press; shrieked out for help; Then, suddenly, was still for very fear. The whole crowd held its breath, and one great heart Beat through it all. Now there arose a cry: Yet while the silly people did but scream, Down from his charger leaped the cavalier, Dashed in the throng, and, ere I cried God bless him, The boy was laughing in his mother's arms! Fil. Now, I recall some little scene like that. Cos. 'T was a great scene! The Duke stretched out his hand; And, glorious in his dimmed and miry suit, The hero mounted lightly on his horse. Some nobles laughed, some sneered, some looked askance; But all the people raised a mighty shout; And the great sun, bursting a heavy cloud, Shone round Juranio like a halo! Fil. Brave! Yet, cousin, I saw not one half that you did. I heard a child scream; heard some voices call; Saw a man quickly leap down from his horse; Heard a faint murmur; then the show went on.â About the sun and halo I know nothing. Cos. 'T was many a day ere I forgot the Count; And when we met this morn, a sudden thrill Of the old feeling stirred my memory, And brought me back that moving scene again,â Which much confused me. Fil. Ah! âWhich much confused you!â Take my word, cousin, our heroic Count, When he caught up the beggar's little boy, Caught up a certain lady's heart, I wot of.â But I approve it. Cos. What do you approve? Fil. The catching up of fair Costanza's heart. Cos. I beg you, cousin, not to break your jests Upon so grave a subject. Had my mother O'erheard your heedless nonsense, this would be A stormy day for me. Fil. I have a secretâ Nay, a surmise, which I have made a secretâ That casts a fearful shadow.â Cos. I am listening. Fil. I fear to speak; knowing the steadfast love You cherish towards your parents. Cos. Dear Filippia, My marriage has perplexed you sadly. Speak; For it must be your subject. I absolve you From your hard promises. Come, come, give tongue; Draw off your rancor to the very dregs: Ill words, well-purposed, have no mischief in them. Fil. Has not your mother an o'er-anxious care About this marriage? Cos. Is it not a duty She owes my father? Fil. But your father looks So sad and moody! Then he never speaks. There 's something in his silence. Cos. It reveals The wishes that lie nearest to his heart. He fears his choice has swayed my inclination; And that I marry signore Marsio More from a sense of duty than from love: So he withholds his counsel, leaving me My own conclusion. Fil. Doubtless that might be. I could unfold such things.âThe saints forgive me! Love, gratitudeâowed, if not well repaidâ O, why do you cry out so loud against me? She took me when a child, a helpless orphanâ When no one else would keep meâwhen my kin Hawked me about, with a sour charity, From one hand to another;âreared me so That the most jealous eye could not detect Wherein my training differed from her own, Her own dear child, Costanza's; for whose sakeâ But what affection pardons treachery? Cos. Filippia, darling, pray be plain! Fil. No, no; I cannot, dare not. I have said too much. Your mother's smile will be a long reproach To me, who should deserve, above all others, The never-ending smile she suns me in. I have had thoughts, base, base, degrading thoughts, But I will kill them, if I perish with themâ Which, but to speak, would make yon old Tiburzzi Leap up and shudder in their frames; would shake This ancient roof-tree on my wicked head, And hide my shame in ruins! It were just. Believe me not, Costanza; scorn my hints; Cling to your motherâshe is worth your love. I, IâO, vile!ânay, do not pity meâ Am the most faithless of a high-souled race! Cos. What mean you? Speak!âYou do not love me. Speak!â What is this mystery? Speak! Fil. No; never more. We must all wreck together; I am dumb. ACT III. SCENE I. The Park of the Marquis di Tiburzzi. Enter Juranio. Juranio. Hail! once again, thou blooming vine-clad bower! How long is it since the fair mistress' hand Curled thy soft tendrils to this artful flow, Moulding the straggling wildness of thy humors Into such harmony? By your leave, rose. [Plucks a rose.] These crumpled features tell some dainty hand Has pressed into the cramped and knotted bud, To force its backward nature into flower. Say, have you told her, treacherous confidantâ For you are full of whispering winds, that tell To me, a late companion, many a tale Of the gray East, where all your kindred speak The lover's low, close languageâhave you told How oft your leafy screen has covered me, While she, the mistress of us both, swept by, Sad, but majestic? Wherefore is she sad? My tongue runs tripping, but my heart is lead. O, Count Juranio, what a fool art thou, To waste thy manhood on a maid who cares No atom for thy countship! To lie hidden, Hour after hour, upon the dank, rough ground, Merely to catch the glimmer of a girlâ A girl who casts the pearl of her affection Before that swinish usurer, Marsio! By heaven, 't is villanous! And were it notâ So much her seeming gives report the lieâ That I believe this marriage forced upon her, By the parental usage of our land, I'd fly her as infectious. What, what! she To prop a selfish dotard's crumbling house With the untimely ruins of her youth! To spin a few thin moments for his age Out of her heart's blood! Suffer worse than death, That one old man may crawl down to his grave With a stuffed pocket! By the blessed saints, Blood has no claim upon her! She is mad, To nurse the childish folly of old age To such portentous bigness! Ha! once more Hide love and me, my sweet confederate! [Goes behind the bower.] (Enter Costanza.) Costanza. Fit season for my visit. It was morn When first I met him; every leaf and flower Looked up and opened to increasing day; Nature spread wide her arms, in liberal joy, Yielding her flushing bosom to the sun. Even as a tardy flower, my heart unclosed To revel in his presence; even as Rejoicing nature, my whole quickening frame Glowed into new existence. While the sun Plunges in haste behind yon western clouds, To course dun night around his broad domain, The leaves and flowers may weep themselves to rest; Nature may cross her placid arms in sleep, And dream of morn beneath the merry stars; But, ah! to me there is no tearful rest, No quiet sleep, no dream of happiness, No star of comfort. In the middle heaven, Yet veiled and ominous, burns my sun of love, Never to set again. Ju. Hold your peace, winds! Silence, ye fluttering leaves, that I may hear her! [Aside.] Cos. Juranioâ Ju. My name! [Aside.] Cos. Juranio, 'T is weak, 't is wicked, to maintain my grief On thoughts of thee. For thought breeds love, and love Redoubles grief, and grieving multiplies Both thought and love, in an unending round. O! had we met one little day before, Ere fate could mock me with the double pain Of what I am, of what I might have been! I know thou lov'st meâ Ju. (Advancing.) Hadst thou been inspired, Thy words could not be truer. Cos. Ha!âO, shame! JuranioâCount Juranio!â Ju. Hear me, love! Cos. Begone, begone, sir! Ju. Hear me, dear Costanza! [Kneels.] Cos. By what new license do you use that title? Ju. By the allowance of your lips. (Pietro Rogo crosses the back of the scene, observing Costanza and Juranio, significantly.) Cos. How low, How far beneath my honest scorn, you seem, Poor Count Juranio! Will you not arise?â The place is public. Or do you intend To crown your treachery with my dishonor? Ju. A day of marvels! (Rises.) But a minute sinceâ The words even now are echoing in my heartâ I heard youâif a man may credit senseâ I heard you, ladyâ Cos. Crop the guilty ears That were abettors to their lord's disgrace! Is it your custom, Count, to play the listener? Our former meeting was in some such way As this wherewith you honor me. Ju. Coquette! Cos. Signore! Ju. I heard enough to settle such a name On all the seed of Eve. Cos. Redoubted cynic! Where has your manhood fled, that you employ Knowledge so basely found, so weakly used, Upon a lady? What I may have said In lavish fancy, granted truth compact, Stands by the favor of your merit only: After this paltry actâthis poor attempt To scare me to confession, by arraying My private thoughts against my open wordsâ How rank you your own merit? Had you been The generous man I one time held you for, My thoughts had sunk, as rain-drops into sand, To cool, but not to quicken. Leave me, sir! Ju. Costanza di Tiburzzi, ere I go, Listen. I love you with a single heart. I do confess much folly in the deeds To which love drew me. Hidden by yon bowerâ While peeping buds unfolded into flowersâ While infant leaves uncurled their tiny scrolls, And, full-grown, basked them in the mellow sunâ While all creation was an active hymn Of ceaseless labor to approving Godâ I have stood idly, though the dear time sped, Waiting to catch the faintest glimpse of you. Then, happy with that treasure of my sense, Have hied me home, to fill my waking thoughts With growing fancies; or, through fleeting night, Made my dreams golden with the memory Of what had blessed my day. I cover nothing: I have no skill nor wish to circumvent you. You know the mystery of my presence here; You know the secret of my love,âah! yes, You knew it ere I spoke it. You can lift, By confirmation of your former words, A sinking heart to rapture. Speak, O, speak! My fate hangs on your mercy! Cos. Have you heard No rumor of my marriage? Ju. Yes; a rumor,â A baseless rumor. Cos. Ere another week, That rumor and my fate will be but one. Ju. Is there no hope? Cos. I chose my portion, sir. And must abide the issue. Ju. Dear Costanza, Did you but know the energy, the power, Which I might use to sway your destiny; To foil a wretchâ Cos. Hold! Do you counsel me To scheme against my honor? Farewell, sir! I know not by what weakness I have staid To hearâKind Heaven, some strength! [Aside. Exit hastily.] Ju. Stay, lady, stay!â What, shall I follow?âGods! I'll drown this feeling! Follow, forsooth, to glut her cruelty, To make myself the plaything of a girl,â I, Count Juranio, follow like a spaniel, And on a cold scent too! Is this thing love? I ween 't is more like hateâsound, manly hate. Cold, cruel, heartless jilt! Yes, she was coldâ Cold, very cold. Love is not self-possessed. But was she cruel? I cannot call her cruel. I hope not heartless. Yet she loves me not. Nay, she was very sparing of my feelings. I broke upon her rudelyâstartled her; At such a time too. Yet she loves me not. Ah! yes; at such a time! while every word Lightened the freight of her o'erburdened heart. 'T was rash in meâthoughtless: I should respect Maiden reserve. She likes not sudden passion. In faith, nor do I. Reason should confirm Our hearts' emotions, ere we give them way. Perhaps she loves me yet! I'll swear she does; Or sovereign Love is but a gilded toy! (Enter Salvatore.) Salvatore. Ho! there, Juranio! Ju. Signore Marsioâ Sal. My name is Salvatore, please you. Ju. So! But let him stand aside; I cannot answer Where love may drive me. Sal. Can you answer me? Deaf man!âJuranio! Are you dumb too? Here, Let us talk with our fingers. Ju. Salvatore, I've met her, spoken with her! Sal. So have I. Ju. What said she? Sal. Little. In my breathing-times, She edged a word in. Ju. What had you to say? Sal. O! nothing plainly; I've not come to that. But, here and there, I tumbled in a hint, Like love astray, which she may ponder on. Ju. You love her? Sal. Ay, sir; she is not preserved; I was not poaching; she is open game. Ju. How did she take it? Sal. Kindly, very kindly. Ju. Villain!âtraitor! [Seizes him.] Sal. Lord love the man! Let go! Is she the only she within the realm? I have another she, to whom your she Is only cousin. Ju. Miserable jester! Sal. No; I am serious. O, thou dear Filippia, Couldst thou but hear this shabby creature sneer At us, and at love's majesty! Base, vile, Soulless Juranio! Ju. On this very spot, Hidden behind yon bower, I heard her own Such feelings for meâah! such rapturous feelings Of maiden innocence! My beggar heart Was rich at once, as if the heavens rained love! Sal. Heard whom? Ju. Costanzaâwhy, Costanza, surely Sal. I pray you do not gall me, kinsman, thus. I am rashly jealous, deadly quarrelsome; I'll fight you for a feather. Ju. While the words Still tingled in my ears, upon this spot, This very spot,âsee where her little feet Have nestled in the grass,âI heard her say She could not love me, never would be mine, And, worse than all, would marry Marsio! Sal. Worms gnaw the fellow! All Filippia said Was âMarsio, and Marsio,â and âCousin, Poor, poor Costanza!â And now you begin! Think you the heathen means to wed them both? What is this Marsio? Ju. A wealthy merchant, Or usurer, or some such sorry thing, Picked by the Marquis for his daughter's bed: A slow, sure matrimonial poison, used To fatten purses,âdeath to flesh and blood. Sal. I understand. We must be rid of him. Ju. But how? Sal. Quite simplyâ[Musing.] Ju. How? Sal. Why break my thoughts? I quarrelled, fought him, was just burying him, By an unfailing plan; but you destroyed it. (Enter Pulti, singing.) Pulti. The devil looked down, With a curse and a frown, And to the young witch he said, 'Ods blood! I 'd far rather Quell hell in hot weather, Than govern one headstrong maid! Ju. Whence comes that devilish song? Sal. From yonder knave. Come hither, nightingale. Pulti. You called me, signore? Sal. Ay, warbler, unperch. What is the news in hell? Pul. The devil has a surfeit of light fools, And sends for solid food; I'll pass you by. Sal. Now, by his tongue, the bird 's a woodpecker. Pul. And rapping on your poll. Sal. His tongue 's a foil: He foins and parries like a mountebank. Whom do you serve? Pul. Myself most faithfully, To answer strictly; but I give, sometimes, To answer more at large, slack services To signore Marsio. Sal. That name again! How many Marsios are there? Pul. One at present. He gets to breeding shortly; there'll be more Ju. Are you purveying for a cudgelling? Pul. Heaven knows. What means the gentleman? Sal. Scarce nothing: His thoughts are hardly fantasies just now. How do you like your service? Pul. Why, so far As one may thrive on musty wine, thin diet, Most scanty wagesâ Sal. What a churlish wretch, To treat so brave a fellow to such fare! Pul. Signore, you wrong him. I'm as well supplied With work as bees are; I've more blows than Winter; Oaths thick as stars; frowns bountiful as sunlight: I am called up early, like an April violet; Sent to bed tardily, like a waning moon; I am railed and sneered at like Heaven's providence; Outraged like modest natureâ Sal. So! boy, so! Is Marsio honest? Pul. Passably, so far; But then, you know, the devil has a say, Sooner or later, in the best of lives. Sal. Would you change masters? Pul. Ay, with Satan's dog. But that is hopeless; wit 's uncurrent coin; Men drop me sooner than they take me up. Sal. Serve me. Pul. I'm yours. Now, farewell, Marsio! I'll leave my rags as keepsakes. Sal. Not so fast. My service is peculiar; but its wages Out-go your dreams. A fortnight I desire You watch o'er Marsio, note his slightest act, Become more zealous, more familiar with him; Let naught escape you. When the time is fair, You'll run to me, and make a full report. I have suspicions of this Marsio's truth, From certain hints a shrewd-brained lady dropped; And should I catch himâ(Aside.) Can we not agree? Pul. How! I play spy! Sal. Are you a Christian man? Pul. Yes; of the latest make. Sal. Then hearken, man! If Marsio 's honest, you can say no ill; If he is false, 't is nothing but plain duty To fright his brother sinners with his sins. Make him hell's scare-crow; for example, brother, Is your best governor of coward man. There is a pithy sermon, preached for you, Upon the mote and beam text. After this Short fortnight's service, life is all your own. Pul. I'll do it. But forgive me, if I think Your promise better than your argument. Sal. The knave is apt. [Aside.] Ju. Kinsman, 't is treacherous To set a spy upon your enemy: You lower to his level. Sal. Well, sir saint, E'en leave the schemer to his wicked schemes. Wash your hands, Pilate! I can bear the sin. RememberâWhat 's your name? Pul. Pulti, good master. Sal. Remember, Pulti. Pul. Ay, sir; have no doubts. This wretch, this crooked beast, this Marsio, Must beâWhat, what? I 'm working in the dark. Sal. That saves the sin. Pul. I am not tender-minded. I have the knack of talking sins to naught, With your best casuists. Use your pleasure, master. (Sings.) Quoth the fiend, I was born On a Friday morn, My fall out of heaven was Friday, On a Friday the reign From my kingdom was ta'en;â The curse of the seven was Friday! To-day is Friday, sir. Sal. That 's the tune, bird! Time wears, Juranio. Ju. Why, let it wear! Would you clog time? Put wings upon his feet: Each passing day 's a drop of precious balm To wounded hearts. Alas! what empty talk! Time will but add another, deeper pain, The curse of memory; a dreary waste Of blasted life, stretching from now to death! Sal. You and your love make up the universe! Ju. Then leave me to my world. I would not talk; I wish no comfort, no companionship, No mocking hope, no fruitless sympathy. Sal. Ugh! what a wintry heart! I hope yet.âCome! [Exeunt.] SCENE II. The House of Marsio. Enter Marsio and Pietro Rogo. Marsio. You saw her, said you? Do you know Costanza? Rogo. Do I know you? Mar. I cannot credit it. Rogo. You would not credit it. Mar. Upon his knees? Rogo. As fine a looking fellow as you'll meet. A Court-gallant, a man of her own tribe, A new Adonis, who strings women's hearts On mournful osiers, like an angler's fish. Trust me, a dangerous youth, with broad, white brows, That buzz with sonnets, and such lady-traps, Like two great bee-hives. There I saw him down, Down on his knees.â'T would pose you, Marsio, To spring your chalky joints. Mar. Pshaw! Pietro, Your trick is barefaced. Rogo. Trick, trick!âHow? pray how? Mar. You 'd make me jealous. Rogo. By the blessed Virgin, I swear I spoke the truth! Mar. If it be so, I'll crush Tiburzzi, daughter, wife, and all, Into the dust! Look you, friend Pietro, I hold these beggars in my open hand. Here, hereâI have been provident for slipsâ This little parchment covers all their worth Down to a lira. Only let them blench, And they shall pray for Purgatory. 'Sblood! Trick me!âuse me!âmake me security For a cracked daughter! Rogo. Who 's to blame but you? Mar. Enough of that. I'll watch her, Pietroâ Nay; are you serious? Rogo. On my soul, I am! Mar. I'll tax her with it. Will you not confront her? Rogo. That were base usage. Mar. Furies! what care I? She 'd make a stale of me before we 're coupled! Rogo. Mend your own botching. Mar. Marry, that I will! And yet I'll wed her, spite of her and you. Rogo. That frets me little. Mar. O! I know your drift! You have bred a crooked notion in your brain, That still keeps twisting. You would shape the end Of the disastrous prophecy you made, Merely to be called prophet. Look you, look you, Martyrs are fashioned of such holy stuff! Rogo. Your rage defeats your judgment. I would guard, Not govern you. Mar. Come, let us to the Park. Perchance we'll meet these billing doves again: And if we do, Tiburzzi's crazy house Shall rattle in his ears as if doom's trump Clamored against it! We will say no more. I'll see her, Pietro.âA word ends all. [Exeunt.] SCENE III. The Park of the Marquis. Enter Filippia and Salvatore. Salvator. By Cupid's beard, I love you hugely, lady! Filippia. By that same oath, I doubt it strangely, signore! Sal. Try me by all love's ordeals; if I fail In any point of doctrine, faith, or duty, Protest me arrant. Fil. Fairly challenged, sir. I have a test. Sal. O! name it, name a thousand! Fil. You are acquainted with my cousin's fate, With her betrothal to one Marsio? Sal. Gods! I know nothing else! Fil. Fie! restive lover! Sal. Between Juranio and you, my knowledge, My precious knowledgeâscraped by hard degreesâ Bids fair to be ingulfed in that one fact. Fil. Be patient. Would you win? Sal. On any terms. I might stand Marsio's name some ten times more; Costanza's some two-score.âBut do be brief; My reason totters when you mention them. Fil. We'll drop their titles. If you foil this marriage, My hand is yours; ay, and the largest piece Of a most grateful heart. (Enter, behind, Marsio and Pietro Rogo, observing them.) Sal. But should I fail? Fil. Were mankind merged in one, and you that one, I vow I would notâ Sal. Hist! swear not; 't is wicked. What if you broke your oath? 'T were perjury; A deadly sin. I swear by saving rules, That take the peril from a broken vow: Let me do all the swearing. Fil. I am firm. I err in asking this; but, having erred, I'll have my wish to lull my conscience with. Sal. I merely sought to guard against mischance. [Kneels.] Here, on my knee, I swearâ (Marsio and Rogo advance.) Marsio. Hem! Sal. Zounds! who 's this? [Starting up.] Mar. He is used to kneeling. This pair, Pietro, And your old eyes, have cozened you. Rogo. No, no; Yon doting couple, and the pair I saw, Are no more like than geese and swans. This park Must breed such creatures. Fil. Marsio himself! Sal. You fellow, there!âSirrah!âyou thieving clown, I'll have you whipped for poaching! Mar. Sir! Sal. You trespass: You are intruding upon private grounds. Mar. They should be private, if you often use them. Sal. How, dog? Mar. Sir! Sal. Quite at your command, sir.âDraw! Here is a pretty piece of level sod; This lady is my second; there stands yours. Draw, draw! [Draws.] Fil. Do not forget yourself! [Apart to Salvatore.] Sal. Not I. This were a speedy way to settle all. [Apart to Filippia.] I wait you, sir. [To Marsio.] Mar. I do not wish to kill you. Put up your sword. I would advise you, friend, To find as safe a scabbard for your tongue. Rogo. 'Sblood! do you bear that Court-fly's impudence? Hark you, sir; signore Marsio is my friend, My next of kin; might I supply his place? [Draws.] Sal. Most charmingly. One of the family Is something toward. [To Filippia.] Fil. Have you no respect, No feeling for a woman? Mar. Shame upon you! I'll cut the first man down who makes a pass. Put up, good Pietro. This cause is mine: He is no friend who takes it off my hands. Make no excuse. [To Salvatore.] Sal. O! never fear for me. Mar. I pardon you, unasked. The gentleman Has the infirmity of wrath. Alas! Heaven made him so, for mortals to forgive. Sal. We'll settle, one day. Fil. Come, come, signore Firebrand; I wish a valiant escort home. Sal. Dear lady, Forgive my rudeness. Fil. No; I praise your zeal. This bold beginning is a happy presage. [Exit with Salvatore.] Mar. Ha! ha! ha! ha!âYou would gull Marsio, ha? [Laughing.] Know you that man? 'T is signore Salvatore, The foremost swordsman in all Italy. Your life would last two passes, and no more, Before his blade. When I crave suicide, I'll take my quarrel up again. Go, Rogo. Rogo. 'Sdeath! no: here I'll abide him. Mar. Mad as a March wind! Is there no other way to tame wild bulls Than butting at them with a pair of horns? Meet him with his own weapons! Where 's revengeâ Where 's honor, satisfaction, and all thatâ When you are wriggling half-way up a rapier, Your heart pinned to your back? I have a way To make his bilbo harmless as a rush; I have an airy weapon that can stab, Without a wound; yet make our satin signore Grovel for life. I'm master of that blade, And he is not: I'll use it, Pietro. Rogo. Keep to your own dark pathway, leave me mineâ Nay, sir; I will not go! Mar. Pish! headstrong man! I am walking towards the Castle, I shall meet him,â With the most lowly reverence of my cap,â If you persist, I'll lead him round this place. I say you shall not fight! 't would ruin me. Now, dear friend Pietro.â Rogo. O! well, to please you. The sun must rise to-morrow. Mar. Are you sure These two were not the pair seen yester eve? Rogo. I swear it, by Saint Peter! She alone, Lady Costanzaâ'sblood! I know her wellâ Was the divinity; the worshipper I never saw before. Within an hour You shall know all about him. Mar. At my house Meet me, anon. I'll bring her secret to you. Lady Costanza has an open heart, And I will tax it. Rogo. Do not trip yourself. You have a dangerous ignorance of rank, And the refinements of its ticklish honor. I fear some blunder. Mar. 'T is the quickest way; I cannot sleep until the fact stand clear. [Exit Rogo.] As for our heady signore of the blade, Let him look well to his economy; To whom he credits, what he owes, what holdsâ To what he eats, what drinks, what physic takesâ To how he sleeps, and how he goes abroad; Let him beware dark nights, and crooked lanesâ Smooth billet-doux, and angry challenges; For, by the wrath to come, a sudden death Might lurk in any of them! Let him watch: He opened credit with a punctual firm; We must break quits ere long! Here lies my path. [Exit.] SCENE IV. A Room in the Castle of the Marquis. Enter the Marquis and Marchioness di Tiburzzi. Marchioness. 'T is the perversity of woman, sir, A subtle fiend forever creeping in Between a young maid and her interest. Our girls are spoiled. The women of this age Are infants from the crib down to the grave,â Weak, mindless children, full of baby whimsâ All smiles, all tears; but he is weather-wise Who can predict their changing humors surely. Ah! for the Roman matrons, the strong moulds In whom the hero race was cast of yore!â What, not bite at the Romans?âsad indeed! [Aside.] Marquis. Our daughter's grief is deeper than a whim; And now her gloom seems doubling. Oft of late I have seen her slyly wiping tears away. If I observe herâfor I cannot help The old love rising sometimes in my eyesâ At once she makes such frantic starts at mirthâ The dreary ghost of bygone merrimentâ The dismal echo, when the sound has diedâ The laughing lip, but not the laughing heartâ That I cannot but wonder at a state So nigh to frenzy. March. She has lost your love. Marq. Can it be that? She shall have all my love; Yes; I will double its best outward show. I have been cruel. It may be that, indeed.â But she has Marsio's love, for which she bartered, Most wittingly, most calmly, my regard. I can forgive her that, too. My old age Is over-greedy, to presume her youth Should cramp its action to my selfish bounds. What arrogance! I had a father once, And loved him dearly; but a little maid Stole me and all my duty. Right, Costanza!â She 's right, I say! March. I did not question it. Marq. I grant you, madam, natural love is pure, Holy, and calm, and fixed unalterably; Yet there is something in that other love, With all its turbulence and fiery passionâ Its frenzies verging into bitternessâ Its sudden heats, and sudden shivering chillsâ A mystery, and a far-fading feeling, So wraps this fruitful union of two hearts, That I can rather think its hidden start To be from some great viewless source above, Than from the many, obvious, natural springs Which rise around us in our wonted paths. What think you, wife? March. Sir, sir, I raise no question. Two passions in yourself hold this debate. Marq. Two struggling passions cause Costanza's grief: Her love for Marsio jars her love for me. March. You 're in a desperate way, sir, if you hope, With the small pack of human faculties, To hunt down girlish freaks. Marq. Freaks, madam, freaks! March. My plot works cross-grained. (Aside.) Could you trust Costanzaâ Ah! how he winces!â(Aside.) You might condescendâ (Enter a Servant.) Well? Servant. Signore Marsio. [Exit.] (Enter Marsio.) Marq. Fair day to you! Marsio. Thank you, my lord. Your daughter? where is she? Marq. Out in the Park. Mar. What business draws her there? Marq. Her love of nature. Mar. Nature!âHuman nature? Marq. No; heaven's and earth's. Sunshine, and air, and flowers, Have stronger charms, for the full pulse of youth, Than the gray walls which chill age cowers in, Through dread of sun-strokes, draughts, and sickening scents. Mar. Sunshine, and air, and flowers! Fine things, no doubt! Is she oft out for sunshine, air, and flowers? Marq. Yes; every hour. I cannot keep her in. She seems to draw some comfort from the breath Of these bland May-days. Mar. The old man is frank. [Aside.] Have you much company?âI ask you this Because I seek acquaintance with your friends. Marq. Friends! I have none.âHow your thoughts skip about!â Besides yourself, and my large family Of well-known creditors, no one, save those Whom it scarce shelters, comes beneath this roof. Mar. No one? Marq. No one. Mar. 'T is sad. Marq. Custom has made What troubled me at first, an easy loss. Mar. But, then, your Park has many charms, Even for the dainty relish of your daughter, And her fair cousinâI must not slip her: But now I met her with a cavalier. Marq. How now! Filippia with a cavalier! I am her guardian; but 't is news to me.â Wife, wife, Filippia with a cavalier! March. Well, well, what harm? This is no nunnery: She is full-aged. Her own sharp-cornered wit Is her best guardian. Marq. I must look to this. Mar. 'T is saidâbut with what truth I'll not avouchâ Your daughter has another cavalier. These cousins hunt in couples. Marq. Fairly said! You would excuse Filippia. Ha! ha! sir; [Laughing.] By the sly twinkle of your eye, I judge You are the other cavalier. Mar. 'Sdeath! no! I have no taste for sunshine, air, and flowers; 'Ods blood! I hate them! Marq. You are strangely moved. Mar. Moved strangely, sir, by a most strange device. 'T were better, till I'm fairly bound, at leastâ Until my honor cannot 'scape her pranksâ That sheâCostanza, sir,âyour daughter, sir,â Showed more regard to common decency! March. What is all this? Marq. Our sweet son, Marsio, Gives us an inkling of his filial love! Mar. Ne'er sneer at me, sir,ânever sneer at me! Marq. I am talking to this lady. March. Pray be calm. [Apart to Marsio.] If signore Marsio has been well informed, He has just cause to take offence. Marq. Gods! madamâ March. Here comes Costanza: she can set us right. Marq. No; she can set you wrong,âcan show how basely You slander purity! (Enter Costanza.) March. You have been walking? Costanza. Yes.âGood-day, signore Marsio! March. Alone? Cos. O, no! O, no! There was one little bird Followed me strangely on, from tree to tree, Measuring his lagging flight by my slow steps, As if he sought to keep me company; And when I paused a moment, he would hop, In open view, upon the nearest spray, And pour into my ears such moving notesâ So melancholy, yet so sweet withalâ That I scarce knew whether to stop and hear, Or to pass on, and end his melody. Mar. Sunshine, and air, and flowers! and now a bird!â Pish! do they take me for a fool? [Aside.] March. Costanza, Had you no other company? Cos. None, mother. Mar. Bah! how she feathers us! I'll pluck your bird. [Aside.] Lady Costanza. Cos. Signore Marsio. Mar. I am a candid manâa little rough, Perchance, sometimes, yet meaning honestly. I never steal upon my enemy, But march straight to him, pounding all my drums. Marq. Your enemy! Cos. Must I be rated one? [Laughing.] Mar. I hope not, lady. But this busy world Buzzed ugly soundsâunlike your pretty bird'sâ Into my ears, as I walked hither. Marq. Well! Would you out-stare each other? Mar. Bluntly, then: 'T is saidâI hope without foundation, ladyâ A bird is not the only company Of your long walks and pauses in the Park. One gossip winks, and swells his windy cheeks, As I go by; then gluts his brother's ears With a low, stealthy tale, told in fierce whispers,â Of how you wander with a cavalier, Pensive and silent, treading down the flowers, That glitter so amid the dark-green grass, As if you really cared not to blot out God's handiwork. Another has a tale, Fetched through a multitude of serving-menâ But all truth 's truth, he will go bail for thatâ Of how this self-same cavalier was seen Upon his knees to youâto you! At this The whole fraternity smile forth a sigh, And pity poor, dull Marsio. Lady mine, I loathe man's pity! Is there aught in this? Whom saw you yesterday?âthe day before? You do not answer. Cos. First, sir, by what right Do you advance the question? March. Answer, child. You are betrothed: he has a right from that. Marq. He has not, madam; nor will I permit My daughter to be catechised. Mar. (Aside.) Ho! ho! I'll tame you shortly. Cos. Signore Marsio, Do not misjudge me. Till my wedding-day, My erring acts will fall on me alone. When I do aught to peril my fair nameâ Which, now, I hold you have no check uponâ I shall be first to show it, and absolve you From all your obligations. Until then, I am the proper guardian of my conduct. Marq. Well spoken, daughter! March. You maintain her folly. Mar. You'll not deny it? March. 'T is but a word, loveâ Nay, for your mother's sake. Marq. For my sake, peace! Cos. Neither will I deny it, nor affirm it. Mar. You dare not, dare not! Cos. Signore Marsio!â Mar. By heaven! I creditâ Cos. Listen to me, sir. Our marriage contract is not ratified; Tear it, I beg you. I have no desire To hold you to it, if you doubt my truth. Marq. Ay, ay! tear up the parchment. Mar. No, no, no! What, would you bait me?âLook, Tiburzzi, look The galled beast turn not on you! I have hereâ No, no; I have at home, in safest handsâ That which shall beggar you. I hold your debtsâ All that heaven left your miserable nameâ Under my mercy! Yes, I bought them up For half-price, sirâyour credit has run lowâ By the sweet saints, I'll use them! March. Patience, signore! Mar. I am all patience, when I am well used. March. You see our situation. [Apart to the Marquis.] Marq. We are toiled, Trammelled, betrayed, by this damned usurer! The Duke shall hear me. Mar. Ah! the Duke, the Duke! Above the Duke sits Justice, robed in law, His mistress and the state's. Best pray to heaven: They say its tardy mercy 's sure at last. Marq. Graceless blasphemer! Here to heaven I cry,â The gray-haired father of this child, ensnared By arts beneath the cunning of a thief,â Against a heartless villain! Cos. O, be calm! No harm shall touch you. Signore Marsio, I will abide the contract. Marq. You shall not! What, do you love him yet? You never did: 'T was feigned, to save me. Cos. As much as ever. Marq. My curses drag you down to his base level!â Cos. My fatherâO, my father! God forgive you; You 've made my father mad! Come hither, sir. Walk with meâhelp him, motherâwith Costanza. Nay, lean on me. Your little daughter, father,â Only a child. Here is the same poor head You used to bless so. I will tell you all: I cannot here. That 's kind. Now come with me. You should respect him, signore Marsio. I hold you to the contract. [Exit the Marquis, supported by Costanza and the Marchioness.] Mar. Well for you.â The devil broil you all! O, yes, my lord, Whisper your daughter, lower upon your wife; I'll mate you yet, for all your starving pride; Ay, and I'll find your lover, lady mine. You have him, yes, you have him, to console Your wretched wifehood. Should he see the day Whereon I wed youâif he be not off, Even at this moment, to the antipodesâ May I be wed and buried in one hour! 'Ods love! fool meâfool Marsio!âHa! ha! [Exit, laughing.] ACT IV. SCENE I. The House of Marsio. Marsio and Pietro Rogo Marsio. JuranioâCount Juranioâwho is he? Rogo. The people's darling, the nobility's Envy and general pattern, the good Duke's Prime favorite and most familiar friend. You will encounter no one, high or low, Who speaks not well of him. Mar. Rich? Rogo. Marvellously; He beggars you. Mar. Hum! Handsome? Rogo. Love-sick girls, In dreams, bedeck the object of their thoughts With no such beauty as our mere calm sense Must render him perforce. Mar. Pietro Rogo, I am not handsome. Rogo. Ho! ho!âWhy no, no! [Laughing.] Neither outside nor in. Mar. I do not see The justice of it, Pietro. Why chance Crowds this man's clay into Apollo's mould, Yet scrapes the fair, plump flesh from my lank fingers, From my gaunt, bony arms, from my crook'd legsâ Scoops out my narrow chestâfrom every part, Where usage orders, steals my buxom matter, To pile it in one lump upon my back; Making me hideous with the very stuff She uses to create a paragon. Why this should be, I say, amazes me, And gravels reason. Well, to kick at fate Is but a laming trick. My reptile form, At least, contains the reptile's cunning. Now, There is some justice there. Perhaps your Count, For all his beauty, lacks the use of it. Has this fair shape a mind? Rogo. We'll see anon. The people give him out as full perfection. What said your lady-love? Mar. Ah! there 's the doubt; I cannot fathom her. Rogo. Nor ever will. When you believe you touch the lowest depths Of women's hearts, there 's something still beneath, You wot not of. Mar. Tush! Pietro: I tell you I hold my friend Tiburzzi in a leash, To come and go as I may whistle him. Rogo. How bears he that? Mar. He struggled for a while; But when I hinted what a time they pass Who tug their lives out at a galley's oar, Neither for gain nor pleasure; how to row Even a shallop, without any aim, Would be a sad thing; and described a hulk As something bulkier than Costanza's shoe; When, to all this, I hinted doubtful fears Of his dear daughter's fate, if he were gone, He grew a rival for the meekest dove. Rogo. You are a villain, Marsio. Mar. I know it: I'm what is called a villain by a world That sees its huge face in my little glass. 'T is false! I am no villain. I am one Who must achieve what my heart prompts me to, Or be no more forever. I'm as well As any man who works his purposes, Despite his fears. Rogo. For all your interview, You still are doubtful. Why not give her up? I would far rather wed a Magdalen Than a suspected woman. Doubts and fears Make up full half the substance of our ills. Mar. I'll solve my doubts before the wedding day. If she prove true, I gain a trusty wife; If she do notâwhy, even as I said, Tiburzzi rows a galley. I will have My wife or my revenge. Gods! Pietro, The girl looks chaste. Rogo. Looks chaste!âO, save us!âlooks! Yet that might cozen one. I often gaze Upon a piece of ruined womanhood With strange, blind feelingsâa blank wonderment That one so fair, so chaste, to outward show, Must by the cautious intellect be held As mere corruption. There 's a fearful jar Betwixt the heart and brain upon this theme. Mar. I have an ordeal for her. It may be That Count Juranio knelt and prayed to her, As sinners do to the shut ear of heaven, With bootless zeal. Rogo. Yes; even that might be. Mar. You are lenient to-day. Rogo. Low-spirited, Dyspeptic. Mar. Ah! Here is my little plan. Tiburzzi dare refuse me nothing: I Will bring together the enamored Count And his fair idol;âyea, I will cast in His friend, fierce signore Salvatore. Thus His Countship shall have scope, unbounded room; Tempted by love on one side, on the other Urged up by valor. I will throw Costanza And the sweet Count, ablaze 'twixt love and wrath, Into incessant contact, while I watch The play my puppets make.âHa, Pietro? Rogo. Blast your dark plots! But reason splits on you; You'll have your way. Mar. That will I. Come with me. I'll take you to Tiburzzi's house. Perchance He'll hold me better for my company.â Ha, Pietro? Rogo. Ha, Marsio! Sneer, sneer! I will not go. Mar. You fear Tiburzzi? Rogo. No! Curse your Tiburzzi! Would you take me there, As a set off to your own awkwardness? Mar. Ho! ho! well thought! [Laughing.] Rogo. I'll meet you in the Park. Let me have notice when this pretty plot, Against your own repose, is toward. Mar. Yes. Rogo. You'll rue your plotting. Crime has its degrees; Wade in its shallows, and you drown at last. Mar. Lord, Pietro! what a good man you are! [Laughing.] Rogo. I'll have the laugh upon you shortly, sir, If I know aught of woman. Mar. That would be A bitter laugh for old Tiburzzi. No; It must end well. Costanza will prove true; My test will school her virtue, not destroy it; And Count Juranioâ Rogo. Well, well, what of him? I partly love the boy, men speak so fairly. Mar. Why, so do I. But he must feel his trespass; Know what it is to woo a man's betrothed. That were a moral lesson, fitly taught For his soul's health. But lightly, Pietroâ I will but check him with a father's handâ Quite lightly, Pietro. Ha, ha! poor boy, [Laughing.] He will not need correction more than once. Come, come, to business! Love has played wild tricks With my neglected balances, of late. [Exeunt.] SCENE II. The House of Juranio. Enter Juranio and Salvatore. Salvatore. Cheer up, Juranio! Do not hug your grief; All that is lovable in you is wasting Before its sickly drought. Remember, man, You are supported by a deity. The blind brat, Love, despite his want of eyes, Will find you out a way to win at last. Trust your own idol. Shame upon despair! Juranio. You talk, to cheer me, with a cheerless heart; Between your words, your face is sad as mine. Salves for a mortal wound, drugs for the dead, Hopes for the hopeless! Sal. Every thought 's astray. Why, all things are merely as we behold them, Taking such qualities as we bestow. One only looks at the bright side of things; And he 's your gull, the prey of all mankind. Another gloats upon the darker side, Pleasing himself with self-inflicted pain; And he 's your misanthrope. Another scans Both bright and dark, with a calm, equal eye; Lo! your philosopher. But thenânow markâ Comes up the happy soul who looks at nothing, Yet turns whatever is to present pleasure; Tastes Fiascone in thin Pavian wine; Wallows in down upon a bed of straw; Smells roses in a swine-yard; hears sweet tones From the harsh, grating rasps of puffing smiths; Beholds the sunshine glorify the flower, And change all nature to one merry hue, Beneath the duskest sky of bare December. Here 's your true liver, kinsman mine! A man Who neither fools, nor frowns, nor calculates, But dreams away this aching thing called life: Make him your model. If your lady frown, Why, look up one who smiles. Ju. Dear Salvatore, 'T is but a vain attempt to reason down Our smallest feeling. The mind's snow may lie A dreary winter on the torpid heart, Yet never kill it. Slack the rigor once, And, like a violet that leans its cheek In mockery against some melting drift, Up springs the heart, more fruitful for its rest. (Enter Pulti, singing.) Pulti. So the devil was wroth At the gentlemen both, Though no one could fathom his matters; And he dashed around hell, Like a dog tailed with bell, And tore all his dwelling to tatters! Sal. Well, Pulti, well? Pul. Signore, it is not well. I am beaten to a cripple; I must leave; I cannot stand your service longer. Sal. Why? Pul. Marsio is mad. Would you could see him now! He foams and rages round his frighted house Like a bear newly caged. He 's full of curses, Full of dire threats against some hapless foes; And every time he passes meâO Lord!â My humble manner seems to prick him soâ He takes compassion on his enemies, And deals me half their vengeance. See me, sir! I am basted like a piece of English beef: I had just strength to crawl here, and no more. Sal. Who has enraged him? Pul. That I cannot tell. Two gentlemen, I judge, by what I hear: By what I feel, I judge these gentlemen Must bear a striking likeness to myself. Sal. Can he suspect? Ju. What is there to suspect? The length that I can enter in his thoughts Would be a comfort to him. As for you, Doubtless he has forgotten you ere met: These merchants have no care for points of honor. Sal. Butâ (Enter a Servant.) Servant. Signore Marsio. Sal. What, what? Pul. The devil! O, could I clamber to the frozen moon, And cut away my ladder! Ju. How is this? Sal. What said you, sirrah? Serv. Signore Marsio waits. Ju. Admit him. [Exit Servant.] Pul. O, I beg you, sirâ Sal. Here, Pulti, Into this room. Pul. Avaunt! A priest, a priest! [Exit.] Sal. What can this mean? Ju. Marsio will tell us that. (Enter Marsio.) Marsio. Am I intrusive? Ju. O no; welcome, sir! Mar. A good-day to you, signore Salvatore! We have met once before. Sal. Good-day to you! He claims acquaintance on strange introductions. [Aside.] Mar. You wonder at my coming, gentlemen. I am but agent for my lord, the Marquis. He honors my betrothal to his daughter With a small feast to-night. We want but guests. Knowing a sadly-broken intercourse Had once existed 'twixt your name and his, I volunteered to bear my lord's respects And humble wishes to you. May we hope? Sal. Why, signoreâ Ju. We will come. Sal. How, Count? Ju. We'll come. I rage with thirst; the sweet I cannot taste, I'll drain the bitter to the very lees, And she shall see it! [Aside.] Mar. Further, gentlemenâ Though I am trenching on fair courtesyâ Could you not pass the dayâ't is early yetâ With the good Marquis? So preparing you, By slow degrees of interchanged regard, For more familiar greetings at the feast. I push your kindness; but my lord's content, And a desire for your unfrozen ease, Is my sole object. Ju. Yes! by all the gods! Mar. Ha! why this energy? (Aside.) You shame my thanks By more than noble courtesy. Farewell! Within an hour my horses will be round. Ju. Expect to meet us. Mar. Lo! the trap is set. Look how you tread, my courtly innocents, Or Herod's bloody day shall come again! [Aside. Exit.] Sal. A strange request: I think him honest, though. Ju. I care not what he be. Sal. The saints protect us! You 're roaring drunk with love and jealousy, Blind and incapable. Ju. I'd reach the worst. To be forever baited by my passions Is more than I can bear. My hopes and fears Tear me to pieces. I am man enough To toss despair into the grave of love; But these sweet tortures of insidious hope Oppose no front to armÃ©d fortitude. Sal. Now you talk sanely. When you come to blowsâ To strangling passion, burying despair, And setting up a commonwealth of reasonâ My heart fights with you. You shall have your way. Ho! for Tiburzzi! (ReÃ«nter Pulti.) Pulti. Signore Salvatore, [Sings.] O! pray what said the devil, With his cloven tongue of evil, As he drew his hoof under his gown? Why, to them he said sweetly, Sweet gentlemen, I greet ye! But he wished they might hang, starve, and drown. Sal. Whate'er he wished, he spoke us fairly, Pulti. Pul. I heard it all. Beware of Marsio! You know him not, as I do. I suspect You are the gentlemen who woke his wrath. Ju. Pish! how? Pul. Do we not often fall to hating For the same cause we mostly fall to lovingâ Simply, for none at all? Perhaps your cloak Is of a hateful dye in Marsio's eyes; You grow moustaches, but he loathes a beard; Your dress is much too dandified; your hat Worn too much on one side; your cheeks Hint of the roses, and he scorns a rose; Your hair is raven black,ââOut upon black!â Says Marsio; âblack hairs thatch empty heads.â Here is enough to raise a riot, sirs, And overturn a state. Why will you go? I am sure he means you ill. Sal. Why think you so? Pul. I cannot tell; I have no reason for it; My mind jumped to that end. Ju. We waste time, kinsman. Pul. O! do not, do not go! Ju. Peace, sirrah, peace! Pul. I have more interest in you, gentlemen, Than your best gold can buy. You are the first, For many a weary day, who've made me feel The simple worth and dignity of man. I've hidden my heart under outrageous mirthâ O, heaven! how sad it beat there!âtill my jests Became a natural language. I have lived To sneer, and to be beaten; all content If my poor wit were sharper than the blows. I love you for your kindness.âHear me, sirsâ I'd rather see this fair world torn to shreds, Than harm befall you. Ju. I respect your grief; And were my life not centred in this thing, Your single wish should sway me. Salvatoreâ What, you hold off! Sal. You know for whom I do it. Pul. If Marsio escape my eyes to-day, May I want eyes to see him on the morrow! [Aside.] Ju. I'll go alone. You cannot balk me thus. Were Marsio the devil Pulti sings, I would confront him. Ere the night set in, I shall be free; orâDown, ye maddening hopes! O! were your whispers certain prophecy! [Exeunt] SCENE III. A Room in the Castle of the Marquis. Enter Costanza and Filippia. Filippia. After this treatment of your father, too? Costanza. Yes, yes. Each act which sinks him in my mind, Binds me more closely to him. I but think Of my poor father, feeble, heart-sick, dying, With nothing but the mercy of this man Between him and the galleys. Gracious heaven! Marsio dared threaten him with even that, While all the glory of the setting sun Looked on him through the windows! Do men think That this vast theatre of their wickednessâ With its brave lights of sun, and moon, and starsâ Its shifting scenes, from Spring around to Winterâ Its moving canopies of cloudy blueâ Is crowded with a spiritual audience, Keeping mute watch upon our lightest acts? Fil. Ah me! I know not. Musing minds, like yours, Ask questions without answers. Save my eyes! Are these things phantoms? (Enter Marsio, Juranio, and Salvatore.) Marsio. Good-day, ladies!âHow! Are we infringing on your privacy? Pray, what disturbs you? Nay, we will withdraw. Cos. Stay, signore: you mistake us. Mar. By your leave, I bring two friends of mine, or rather guestsâ Guests for the present, friends henceforth I hopeâ To share our feast to-night. Receive them kindly; For they deserve no less. Let me present, Lady Costanza, Count Juranio. Cos. Sir, we have met before.â Mar. Ah! so indeed? A chance acquaintance, doubtless. As my friend, He asks a double share of your regard. Mistress Filippia, signore Salvatore: I pray you know him. Fil. Do not jeer at me! You know we 've met before. I will not stand To be a butt for your dull, headless jokes! Mar. Gently, my little lady, gently now! Do I o'erstrain good breeding? Have you had A formal introduction to my friend? Salvatore. 'Sblood, signore Marsioâ Mar. Banish all restraint. Swear if you list, dear Salvatore, swear! The ladies will forgive you, for my sake. Hang on no ceremonious usages. I beg you'll know each other. Laugh, dance, sing; Open all avenues to fellowship; For, by my hopes of wedded bliss, old Time Shall make oblation of this day, at least, To rouse the gods of genial jollity! Where hide the old folk? Let us seek them.âWhat, You laggards!âForward, to the stretching Park! Stone walls cramp action. Lead my lady forth, Good Count Juranio. Why, you stand amazed; Dismal as death! Cannot a man be gay, Without your wonder? Count, conduct your charge I give you a safe escort, lady mine. Now, Salvatore, buckle sweet Filippia Under your strong right-arm. I'll follow you, With nothing but my mirth for company. Sal. Can Marsio be mad? [Apart to Filippia.] Fil. Heaven only knows! My heart is fluttering at a fearful rate. [Apart to Salvatore.] [Exeunt Costanza and Juranio, Filippia and Salvatore.] Mar. So, well done, now! Lord! how they fall to talking! My presence must have been a chill upon them. Bless us! Filippia's all alive with speech; Arms and hands goingâhow she brings them down!â Clinching some sentence, through and through, with truth. And now she darts her head and curving neck, Like an affronted swan. Ha! quiet yet, Costanza, pensive still! And your fine Count Striding as at a funeral! Why is this? Where 's your love-rhetoric? Heaven speed ye all! The twigs you tread are limed. Join wits with me! Who is the fooler now? who are the fooled? [Exit.] SCENE IV. The Park. Enter Costanza and Juranio. Costanza. Where are our friends? Juranio. They have deserted us. Cos. Let us return to them.âWhy came you here? Ju. To be a guest at your betrothal-feast. Cos. But was that kindly done? Ju. I cannot say: One, more or less, can make small difference. Cos. Sir, you dissemble with me. Ju. Do I, lady? Who taught the lesson? Cos. Is it manly in you To seek so poor a victory over me? Perchance, you thought to see my features pale, My eyes swim blindly, and my limbs give way, When you approached me first.âYou did not, sir! Perchance you think when, at the festival, They toast my union with Marsio, To see me falter, nay, to faint outrightâ A crowning triumph for your vanity.â You shall not, sir! O! Count Juranio, This is unworthy a less man than you! Ju. As you behold it; but you wrong me much. Why have you ever held me in contempt? Why have you sought the motives of my acts Among the lowest heaven allows the base? Why have you turned my honest love aside With irony? I never wronged you, lady,â No, by my soul, neither in word nor thought! I never wished to tempt you into ill, With the bare modest offering of my love. Why do you fly a gentleman's regard, And fix you on this loveless Marsio? Cos. These are strange questions, Count Juranio. After to-day, our paths lie far apart; Pledge me your honor ne'er to see me more, And I will answer.âNay; my fate is fixed. Ju. You will not understand me: your ill thoughts Stretch to futurity, and hint at things Beyond my heart's conception. I would rather, Far rather, know your holy chastity Were pining in a dungeonâdyingâdeadâ Than clasp your blighted beauty in my arms, With Helen's charms joined to it! Cos. Gentle sir, You misconceive me. I would spare the pangs, The fearful struggles, which our loveâ Ju. âOur love!â Cos. Ay, ay! I love you, love you, love you! I tell it to you with a breaking heart: I must speak once, though ruin follow it. A little while, and this still agony Shall vanish from existence; yes, the sod Will rest as quietly above my grave As o'er a yearling infant's. Ju. Happiness! Costanza, dearest,âturn not from me now: I am all yours. O! I have loved you long: I'll spend my life in telling you how much. Do not allow cold fancies to tread down These buds of joyous promise. There is naught Between us and the fulness of our hopes, Save feeble Marsio. Cos. A giant! Ju. No; A very pigmy. Dearest, do not shun me. Cos. I pray you, Count, remove your hands from meâ My father's life hangs on my constancyâ Away, sir, I am sacred! Ju. Spurned again! Do you act thus to torture me? O! answer! Is cruelty your practice, grief your sport? You walk in mystery; every deed is blank And purposeless to me. Cos. Forbear, forbear! You should not taunt me thus. My destiny Tramples on love, and overrules my life. O! tempt me not! Ju. Explain, explain yourself. I would not think unworthily of you. Cos. You know my father's povertyâ Ju. Yes, yes; And to enrich himâfor his sake aloneâ Am I not right?âyou marry Marsio. Cos. Quite right. But my betrothal was performed Ereâereâ Ju. You loved me. But what hinders now? Cos. My father's debts were large, strewn here and there, The wide accumulation of old dues Gathered for ages round our sinking house. Marsio knew this, and bought the scattered claims For a bare trifle; though the full amount Would beggar a state's revenue to pay. He held these debtsâalas! that I can say it Of one to whom I must be linked for life!â Above my father's helpless head, and swore Either to wed me, or to send my fatherâ Think of it, signore, an infirm old man, Full of ancestral pride and gentle thoughtsâ Yes, to send himâchained, coupled, mixed with thievesâ Even to the galleys! Ju. The outrageous wretch! I'll bury him in gold! Cos. Too late, too late! Though you held all the Indies in your fee. Upon the threatâfrom which no prayers could move himâ I promised Marsio, most solemnly, To keep my marriage-plight. Ju. Alas! I mourn More for your fate than for the loss of you. (Enter, behind, Marsio and Pietro Rogo, observing them.) Is there no way? Yes, yes; the Dukeâ Cos. The Duke! The holy Pope, himself, is naught to me Before my promise. Ju. Lady, do but think Of the long life of weary misery That lies before you. Cos. I have thought of that. Will you attend the feast now? Ju. I am bound, Almost by oath, to Marsio. Cos. Indeed!â Ju. After the feastâO heaven! have mercy on me! I cannot, cannot yield you. Chance, nay, heaven Has thrown me in your way to succor you. I slighted women till the day we met: Each feeling which love's prodigals spread out, In lavish wastefulness, upon your sex, I have stored up to tender you alone. Shall all be lost? Ah! ladyâ [Kneels.] Cos. Count, be strong! Life 's but an atom of eternity. Ju. But love makes life immortal. Cos. 'T is in vain; You must not strive to weaken my resolve. Farewell! Ju. So be it, then. (Rising.) Yet, ere you go, Leave some remembranceâay, that golden cross Is a fit emblem of my martyred love. Cos. No, no; forget me. It were weakness, sir, To pamper memory with a toy like this. Yet when a thought of me will come to you, Judge me not harshlyâas of one who died, Rich in rare gifts, bequeathing you no partâ But as a poor, poor friend, who, dying, left All she possessed, her blessing.âMay God bless you! [Exit.] Ju. O! fate! what I have lost! Rogo. How think you now? Marsio. That Count Juranio is my best of friends. He proved my wife the soul of constancy. I'll love him from this day. Why, Pietro, I do not see you laughing at meâha! Rogo. Be quiet, man; my laugh may come at last. Juranio will make a famous friend, After your marriage. Just the youth, I think, To show your lady to a masqueradeâ To hand her shawlâto read her fiery poemsâ To dance with herâand do all other things Which you are slow at.âHa! friend Marsio? Mar. Poor fellow! Pietro, I almost fear The hapless youth will pine himself to death Ere I am marriedâthough I'll stir for himâ I fear so, Pietro. Why, look you now, He has a dying face; so strangely pale! Doubtless, there is some fatal sickness nigh, Which this sad interview has hastened on. Poor, crest-fallen lover! Let us speak to him. [They advance.] Ho! Count Juranio! What, you are alone! Where has the lady gone I charged you with? O! faithless guardian! On my honor, Count, I'll never trust her to your care again.â Would you, friend Pietro? Ju. She just departed. Some duty called her to the castle. Mar. Ah! Some duty past persuasion; or no doubtâ So high I value sweet Costanza's charmsâ You 'd have detained her.âHa! Count? Now, a youth, Of your fair person, should have ample power To hold a restive maiden. Rogo. How he rubs him! [Aside.] Ju. I did not urge her stay. Mar. Indeed! Well, well, You lack my feelings;âbut I cannot hope That all the world will look through lovers' eyes. Here 's signore Salvatore, and alone! Fair maids are in discredit. Save you, sir! (Enter Salvatore.) Salvatore. A moment with my kinsman. Mar. Ask a thousand. [Juranio and Salvatore talk apart.] Rogo. The devil take me, if you have a heart! I would not worry these poor boys so much, To sway the dukedom. Mar. Yes, I have a heartâ A heart which these poor boys would trample on, Did I not wear a head to second it. Even now they scheme to compass me. See, the plot opens. Sal. Signore Marsio, You are a merchant, traffic is your trade, You look on all things under heaven as worth Just so much money.â Mar. Mark you, Pietro, Here 's the ideal merchant. Well said, signore; A golden measure is a certain thing To gauge the world with. Sal. Hold you anything You have not measured with this golden rule? Have you aught priceless? Mar. Nothingâlet me think. No; there is naught I know of. Sal. Frankly, then; What is Costanza's value? Mar. Ha! ha! ha! [Laughing.] You are the maddest dog in Christendom! Perchance, you are serious? Signore, if you are?â Rogo. Zounds! Marsio, you are a mean, tame fool, To brook this insolence! [Apart to Marsio.] Mar. Bear with me, friend. [Apart to Rogo.] Sal. My words were plain enough. Mar. Wellâlet me seeâ I should receiveâI put her low to youâ At least ten million ducats. I will give A warranty for kindness, soundness, age;â She has no tricks,âyou may put trust in her. Is this fair dealing, Pietro? Rogo. Pshaw! pshaw! Sal. You jest with me. Mar. Faith, I am serious. Ten million are a serious thing. I wish To fit some argosies. Ten million ducats! Within a year I 'd nearly double them. I want ten million. Ju. Take them, in heaven's name! I still shall have my little villa left Among the vineyards. Mar. But I want that villa. Can you not throw it in? Ju. Most gladly, signore, Yet be your debtor. I have arms to work. Mar. Now, should I wish a limb or so?â Sal. Take mine; Leave my trunk bare. One limb of mine is worth All yonder puny fellow's. Mar. Ha! ha! ha! [Laughing.] Could you unbowel earth of all its goldâ Cover the globe with vineyards, and sow villas Thicker than sands upon the roaring beach, Amid the vine-sticksâwere mankind unlimbed, The whole race at my mercyâthese would make No atom of the sum I hold her at! 'Sblood! will you flout me? Sal. Well, well, I have lost. Mar. Ay, lostâHow lost? Sal. Forgive the liberty. I made a sportive wager with the Count, That I could purchase anything you owned: He named your lady.âAs I live, Juranio, You scarcely used me fairly. Mar. Ah! a jest. Sal. A jest that lifts a trader's character Above my former thinking. Mar. Pietro, If I should put this jesting home again, They could not murmur? Rogo. No, forsooth. Sal. No, no; 'T is give and take. Mar. Why, signore Salvatore, I half believed you meant it. Well done, faith! How did you keep your countenance? 'T was rare! Costanza must know this. So, merry men, On, to the castle! Count Juranio, You played well too. You must feel lively, Count, With such a flood of spirits. Sal. Curse the brute! He cuts Juranio with a two-edged sword. [Aside.] Mar. Now forward, sirs! We must break even yet. I'll plan some joke; but, when 't is working hard, You must not flinch, if it be something rude. Forward, mad boys! We are all jesters now: For want of bells, we'll shake our empty heads! [Exeunt, on one side, Marsio, Juranio, and Salvatore; on the other, Pietro Rogo.] ACT V. SCENE I. The house of Marsio. Enter Marsio. Marsio. Kneel to Costanza,âtest her constancy! There 's something in me mutinies at that: But she shall have full vengeance. Kneel to her! As if I were not. Have I fallen so low That this fine gentleman, this courtly scum, Scorns to regard me? Traffic for her, too! As if I kept my lady on my shelves, To wait a market. On my life, you'll find My heart boils sometimes, and the reek is death To such as stir it! She shall be revenged! [Draws forth a vial.] Now, trembling liquid, who, to look at theeâ At thy pale, sickly aspectâat thy bulk, Cowering to nothing in thy crystal houseâ Would think that thou couldst give so brave a fall To his befeathered Countship? What, canst thou Stiffen the strong steel sinews of yon man Who wields the sword so featly? As I live, I doubt thee, mainly! Come, one sturdy shake, To rouse thy courage. Ha! my little fellow, How thou dost caper! Thou hast spirit, yet. But how to face thee with thy enemies? 'T would fix suspicion on me, to be seen Hanging around their cups. Now, could I bribe Some fool among the servantsâbut whom, but whom? Curse on my negligence! I should have thoughtâ There 's PultiâPultiâ (Enter Pulti.) Pulti. At your elbow, sir, Quoth sin unto the devil. Mar. Merry dog! What brought you back? Pul. You left so hastily, I thought I might be wanted. Mar. Faithful heart! Here is a trifle for you. By my soul, Your love deserves it richly, Pulti. [Gives a purse.] Pul. Well, It makes him so much poorer. [Aside.] Mar. Pultiâ Pul. Signore. Mar. You love your master, Pulti? Pul. That I do! I 'd swim through burning brimstone for my masterâ Good signore Salvatore! [Aside.] Mar. Bravely said! Now, had your master two unresting foesâ Dogging his footstepsâcrossing his fair plansâ Marring his hopesâturning his sweetest cup, Ere it were tasted, to cruel bitternessâ Pursuing him with most vindictive hateâ Ever hot-footed on his way of life, Beating its quiet path to choking dust; Until your heart-sick masterânote me, Pultiâ Longed for the grave to hide him from their wrath; What would you do, brave, noble fellow, ha? Pul. Cut them to slivers! Mar. Famous! Rashly bold, A little over-bold, however. No; You 'd take this vial, hidden in your sleeveâ Thus, Pulti, thusâand when the wine went round, You 'd slyly drop five dropsâno more nor lessâ In each one's cupâha! Pulti? And, next day, This vast machine of earth would tumble on, As if these dreadful bullies ne'er had been.â Would you not, Pulti? Pul. Yes, indeed. I'll swearâ Tell me some fearful oath to swear it by. Mar. Poh! poh! These bugbear oaths are children's toys, Mere scare-crow buckram, to the big-souled men Who do such mighty deeds. But you would sayâ All quietly, in silent, breathless wordsâ My master and myself are in one boat, And sink or swim together.âWould you not? Pul. I would be cautious. Mar. Doubtless, my wise boy! Prudence and courage make a powerful yoke To tug along the world. Pul. I take you, sirâ As rats are taken.âO! I slander rats. [Aside.] Mar. But will you do it? Pul. By this hand, I will. Mar. I love to shake an honest comrade's hand. There 's more gold, Pultiâmillions, millions, boyâ And you shall share it. You shall revel out A prince's ransom; live a gentleman, And kick work to the devil. Hey! my trump! Pul. Who are these enemies? Mar. You long to see The villains drink each other's healths? Pul. Ha! ha! [Laughing.] O! bless me, you are droll! Mar. These are our foesâ Yours, Pulti, and my ownâthat velvet Count, That clothes-pin, modish Count Juranio, And signore Salvatore, carte and tierce, The ruffian, with his beaver on one side, Who swaggers through the world, and pushes all That do not please him in the kennel. 'Sblood! 'T were no great harm to cut such fools adrift; 'T would save some lace a sunning, and give steel A holy rest. Pul. Lord! how you draw them, sir! Those very men have troubled me a deal. Give me some ratsbane. Mar. Just before the feast, I'll slip it in your hand. Be faithful, Pulti; There 's no such gold as mine. Pul. Have faith in me. May heaven forsake me, when I leave my master! Mar. Bring out the horses. I must back again: My absence will be noted. Pul. Bless you, bless you!â I find it in my heart to bless you, sir, That you employed no one but me for this. [Exit.] Mar. The knave 's a God-send! Who had ever thought That little, crooked Marsio could wake So warm a feeling in the breast of man? Why, what a cat's-paw for my dangerous nut The ready villain is! I never deemed The monstrous wretch was crammed so full of sin: He poisons at a hint. Heaven save you, Count! My fiery lover, we will cool your blood: Heaven save you, too, bold signore Salvatore! My dashing swordsman, we will break your guard. Heaven save you both together, gentlemen! I'll bow you to your graves to-morrow morn! [Exit.] SCENE II. An Apartment in the Castle of the Marquis. Enter Salvatore and Pulti, meeting. Pulti. Stand back! I'm Marsio's chief poisoner! [Sings.] Quoth the devil, I'll mix Both the Acheron and Styx, To brew them a deadly potationâ Lord! I'm too gay to sing. Salvatore. Why, Pulti, Pulti! Pul. Unearthed, at last! The fox has broken ground, And I am holding to his brushâho! ho! [Laughing.] Saint Dunstan's tongs were mercy to this hand. O! but I have him! Sal. Pulti, are you crazed? Pul. Half mad with joy. Here is his precious plotâ Sal. Whose plot? Pul. Why, Marsio's. What other fiend Could shape one like it? Had you seen me, sir, Just playing with him, like a well-hooked fish; I gave him all my line. Sal. Now for the plot. Pul. Then tremble! Signore MarsioâHo! ho! [Laughing.] The devil catch me! I must laugh it out. Well, signore Marsio has hired me, meâ Me, meâhis Pultiâdo you understand?â To poison you and Count Juranio. Sal. Ha!âWhere, and how? Pul. O! at the feast to-night. Sal. In meat or wine? Pul. In wine. The merry ape Would see you two pledging each other's healths; Just for the joke's sake. Do you take it? Sal. Yes: How the sky brightens after Marsio's thunder! Bless his invention! I will match his coin. Some paper, quickly. Pul. Here, sir. [Showing paper, on a table.] Sal. Let me think. Now, school of Padua, help thy dullest scholar To mix a draught for Marsio. 'Ods blood! I have not practised physic for so long, That I scarce recollect the crooked things Which stand for drachms and scruples. Pul. Never care For scruples, only call the drachms to mind: I long to dose him. Sal. Ah! I have it now: It all comes back together. (Writes.) Here we are; Signed, Doctor Salvatore. Pulti, runâ Ask for the next apothecaryârun! Our time is short. [Gives a paper.] Pul. Here is a full receipt For all your poundings, master Marsio! Sal. You'll throw the drug in Marsio's cup. Fly, fly! But where 's his poison? You must get me that. Pul. As soon as Marsio puts it in my hands. Sal. Enoughâaway! [Exit Pulti, singing.] Quoth the man to the devil, Thou spirit of evil, Foul poison is brewed from fair peaches; A curse on your vowings! Your scrapings and bowings, Like poison may lurk in fair speeches. Sal. Bright Cupid and dark Death Join hands, in an unnatural fellowship, Like morn and midnight at the northern pole; But I can see a pathway, green with hope, Beneath the twilight. (Enter the Marquis di Tiburzzi.) Marquis. Can you spare a moment? Sal. Your question wrongs me: I would gladly spend A lifetime in your service. Marq. I believe you: Although men's tongues too oft outnoise their deeds, And gain in clamor what they lose in aim. When you approached me for my niece's hand, I saw in you such manly qualities As led me to receive you, not alone As her best suitor, but as my best friend. You are a man of action, I am not; You are a man of hopeful vigor; cares Soon dried my leaves of early promise up, And age puts forth no more. Sir, I am old, Feeble, and hopeless; I would have a friend. Sal. Confide in me. Marq. I need your confidenceâ Not for myself; these gray hairs warn me oft That I shall drop into my barren grave Ere many seasons; but my daughter lives, To blossom o'er my ruins, or to wither. God only knows. Sal. To blossom, bear, and yield, In holy sunshine! Marq. And you know her fate,â Her vile betrothal to this Marsio? Sal. Did you not make it? Marq. No! they juggled me. HerâWell, well, signore, I 'd not think of that. Now, I would break the bond; but Marsio Holds my ancestral debts, and threatens me With whips and galleys. I could bear them all, If that would free Costanza. Sal. Let me add Another misery, then break the whole. Your daughter loves Juranio. Marq. Gracious heaven! Woe piles on woe! Had I a choice of men, I would have picked him for her. Sal. Rightly too, You would have picked the flower. Your simple word, To follow, without flaw, what I design, Shall free Costanza, wed her to the Count, And ransom you. Marq. You mock me. Sal. Mock you! No, no; I'll show you what I rest upon. Marq. You seem a sober man. Sal. To Marsio I am fate's deputy. Crime gives a hold Which rivets the transgressor to an end, So helpless, that an infant's careless hand May pull a giant to his doom. Marq. Crime! Sal. Crime. Marq. Dear heaven, might this be true! I know him cruelâ Ay, guiltyâbut not within the scope of law. Sal. Have I no credit? Marq. Yes; I yield you allâ My faith, my honor. Guide me as you list: You cannot worst my chance. Sal. Then hear my taleâ More fitted to draw blood than tears, my lord: That scheming crawler, Marsio, has hired A man, who loves Juranio and myself, To poison us. Marq. O, horror! Has the wretch Such depths in his dark soul? Sal. It so appears. Marq. I'll hurl him from my windows! Shall a roof That hung so long 'twixt heaven and noble men, Fence off God's justice? Sal. Softly, sir, I pray! He must attempt the poisoning, or we lose Our grasp upon him. Marq. True. What cause can he Set up to satisfy him with his crime? Sal. Against Juranio, 't is jealousy. Marq. I see. Your kinsman was the cavalier Who met Costanza in the Park. Sal. No other: And plead his suit most bravely, but in vain: She made her love an offering for your life. Marq. Poor girl! Sal. Now, hear my mandates. Marq. But your planâ What is your plan? Sal. It must unfold itself. I have a shift for Marsio's every turn: One lost, another wins. Marq. I am content. 'T is better with you; I have ever marred Whate'er I touched. Lay your commands upon me. Sal. Provide a priest, and have such papers drawn, As the law orders, to unite in wedlock Costanza and Juranio. At the feast, See you produce them when I call for them. Marq. It shall be done. O, signore Salvatore, See you be well prepared upon your part. I count my life as nothing; but my daughter, My only daughterâLook you do not slip: You might enrage, not foil, his villany; And draw a double ruin on her head. Sal. Fear not; even now I hold such evidence As makes the life of signore Marsio Not worth a felon's claim. How Pulti tarries! [Aside.] You will pardon me, if I take leave, my lord? Marq. Go, signore, go. Ask me to pardon you! God shield you, sir! You shall have all the prayers My age may mutter, 'twixt the coming night And that far darker night, towards which my steps, By slow degrees, are narrowing to their end. Sal. Cheer, cheer, my lord! The shadows fly from us; Day treads upon the dusky heels of night! Even now my herald hopes fly far above, Shaking the morning from their shining wings! Ho! laugh, laugh, and be merry. Marq. Ha! ha! ha! [Laughing.] Your hearty courage is infectious, sir! [Exeunt severally.] SCENE III. Another Room in the Castle. Enter Costanza and Filippia. Filippia. [Sings.] Love-lorn Lucy On a bank sat sighing, Ah, well a day! ah, well a day! My fickle love has flown away, And left me here a-dying, False, false pledges! Why did I receive them? Vows are but words, words are but air, And air can blow both foul and fair: Why did I believe them? Ah! light-hearted, Would thy scorn might slay me! O! would thy wrongs might end my pain! Or would that thou mightst come again, And again betray me! There 's a light song to cheer you. Costanza. Woful cheer! Fil. Why, what' s the matter, cousin? How you droop! Here 's a strange countenance for a festival! Take my advice; follow your honest heart; For those who oftenest trust their knavish heads Are oftenest led by a fool's bauble. Run, Run for dear life! Away, girl, Count and all! I'll cover your retreat. Cos. This mockery Is cruel and useless. How my doom draws on! It seems to me as if the viewless hours Have changed themselves to some substantial thing, And I can hear them roaring by my ears, Like a vast tide,âalas! alas! how swiftly! Fil. Did she but know how gayly nimble Time Is floating on Love's shallop, she would kiss The slandered gray-beard. I will tell her. No; 'T is Salvatore's secret. [Aside.] Cos. Cousin, cousin, I cannot marry Marsio! Each step That brings me nearer to him shows the man More hideous; and, alas!âI tell you allâ Contrast makes Count Juranio appear Almost a god to him. Fil. Why, so he is; And so is any other honest man. Marsio 's no man; Marsio 's an outcast imp, Banished among us for such evil deeds As set the fiends to staring! Cos. Misery! Have you no word of comfort? I implore Your kindlier feelings, and you meet my grief With scoffs and jeers. Why do you not sustain My tottering firmness? Has my lot become Too low, too mean, for pity? Must I stand By my own power? So be it, then; I'll stand, Though my heart break within me! Fil. I must tell her. (Enter Salvatore. Filippia and Salvatore talk apart.) Salvatore. Have you kept counsel? Fil. By the hardest, though. Don't glare at me. I have obeyed you, tyrant. Lord! if you frown so at the maid, the wife Must feed her love on cudgels! Sal. Peace, peace, peace! Your love shall have sound diet. It was wellâ Look you, Filippiaâit was well I came. Fil. 'T is always well when Salvatore comes. Sal. Bah! you mad witch! I love you fearfully. Fil. And so you show it. I can never tell, When you come nigh me, whether you intend To cut my throat or kiss me. Sal. Instance this. [Kisses her.] Fil. I know not yet. Sal. Till you are satisfied, I'll smother you in kisses. [Kisses her.] Fil. Ruffian, stop! Look at my ruffle. O! had you rude men To do our starching! Woo me by main strength! Sal. Out on your arts! Your wicked witchery Makes me forget myselfâyour cousin too. Fil. She did not note you. Sal. I must speak with her. [Advances to Costanza.] Lady Costanza, dare you trust your honor In my poor hands? Cos. Had I a fear of it, There I should place it. Fil. Justly spoken, cousin! Make him your fate. See what I gain by it,â A crumpled ruffle, and a bleeding lip. Sal. Time presses; I must through at once. [Aside.] Fil. Well, well! Here 's better than yourself to whisper to. Sal. Lady Costanza, without argument, Give me your word to do as I direct, And I engage to scatter your worst fears, And crown your brightest hopes with full success. I hold your future in my happy hands: My power is ample, and my purpose just. Forâmark this, ladyâshould I trench upon Your nicest honor, by the act, I free you From any compact. Cos. Signore Salvatore, You mean this kindly, and I take it so, But know it baseless. Sal. Only promise. Fil. Do! Cos. 'T is said that drowning beggars sometimes vow Rich churches to the saint who'll spare their lives; So Iâpassing my word upon your termsâ Promise, if you fulfil your marvellous pledge, That which defies our voluntary powerâ My dearest love. Fil. Poh! poh! Costanza, âlove!â O! what a doleful effort to be gay! Pray, use some cooler termâthe man is mineâ Say friendship, or affection, or the like: I dread your rivalry. Sal. Filippia lays Our serious feelings, as if they were devils. Fil. He takes her part! Now I am jealous, sir. Come, lead her off from this sad theme. [Apart to Salvatore.] Sal. Alas! Here comes the theme itself. (Enter Marsio and Juranio.) Marsio. Pray, look you, ladies; Here is he that once was Count Juranio; But, now, how fallen, how spent and spiritless! I tried an hour to work a smile from him, But lost my labor. Fil. What 's the trouble, Count? Sal. Are you a man? [Apart to Juranio.] Juranio. There is the misery, That I am man; would I were more or less! [Aside.] Mar. I even took him to your bower, Costanza; Showed what a lurking-place for love it is; Pointed your favorite flowers; glanced here and there, Omitting nothing: but he never smiled. Then I went through my plans of wedded bliss; Told him how soon my marriage-day would come; Invited him to see it.âOn my faith, Methinks I turned a prophet, for his sakeâ Did I not, Count?âand in a vision saw My stretching line of noble progeny. I named them tooâha! ha! I named them for him! [Laughing.] Called one Juranio. Striving thus to cheer His melancholy with my happiness: But yet he never smiled. When he would speak, 'T was only âMarsio, O! were I you!â And then he 'd blush, and catch his sentence up WithââI 'd do so and soââsome petty thing, Beneath my memory. Even now he talked, So sweetly talked, of âDeath, dear, pleasant death! What a kind thing it is that weary men, After the jading day of eager life, Can lay them gently in their earthy beds, And sleep their cares away!â So well he spoke, That, for his eloquence, I nearly killed him, Out of sheer pity. Sal. What a man is this! But justice' arm is up. [Aside.] (Filippia, Juranio, and Salvatore, talk apart.) Mar. (Apart to Costanza.) They tell me, lady, You were insulted in the Park, to-day, By some presuming dunce's love.âNay, nay; Come here. They say you used him bravely, too, As I would wish you. Cos. Ha! he knows it all: I see such meaning in his face. I fearâ [Aside.] A word, sir, with Juranio. Mar. With whom? Cos. With Count Juranio. Mar. Not a whisper. Lady, We mostly add men's titles to their names. (Enter a Servant.) Servant. My lord awaits you, gentlemen. Mar. On, on! The feast invites us. Count Juranio, We'll drown your gloomy humors in our wine. Come, gentlemen. To-night is lovers' eveâ Conduct your lady, signore Salvatore; I too will use the time's sweet privilege: Think me not rude, Count. By your leave, Costanza. [Exit with Costanza.] Sal. You promise me? Ju. Ay; use me as you will: I lack employment for myself. Sal. Go on. Fil. Without you, signore? Sal. Yes.âMake some excuse. O! where is Pulti? Fate hangs on his steps! [Exeunt on one side, Filippia and Juranio; on the other, Salvatore.] SCENE IV. An Ante-Room in the Castle. Enter Pulti. Pulti. (Sings.) With each grain of Heaven's goodness, I will mix one of woodness, And ten solid grains of pure evil; Do whatever you can, You must bolt all, my man, Or starve, quoth to Adam the devil. (Enter Salvatore.) Salvatore. Your fiendish ditty is a guide, at least. Well met! Your news? Pul. I barely saved my time. The guests are down, and I am sent to seek you. Sal. Is the cup drugged? Pul. I mixed the powders in, And poured the wine around, ere I came off. Sal. Two powders? Pul. Two. Sal. Victoria! The one Shall rack him shrewdly, with a piercing colic, Until the opiate act; when he will fall, Upon a sudden, in a torpid stupor, Which will so balance between life and death, That but a feather's weight might turn the beam, And land him in eternity. Pul. It might? I am no feather, and, by all I love, I'll leap into the balance bodily. Sal. No, Pulti; I 've not closed with Marsio. To-morrow I must buy the Marquis' debts, On my own terms; death would upset my bargain. Pul. Here 's Marsio's poison. [Gives the vial.] Sal. Precious, precious vial! You hold the happiness of two dear hearts Pent in your narrow compass! Pul. Is that all? Methinks it comes to little, when 't is brought Down to a liquid form. Had I believed A lover's prophecies upon this point, I 'd have been fool enough to build an ark, Against a second deluge. What a close To all your rhapsodies! Here 's a scant bath For a foul fly! Sal. Enough to drown your wit. Pul. If that 's the substance of love's happiness, Pray trust it to my handling. I will bear it, As friars do rare relics, through the land, To strengthen bachelors in their religion. Sal. Prodigious atheist! Pul. Holy maniac! Now, which is better, a sound infidel, Or a cracked devotee? Let Heaven decide. Sal. Back to your master, knave! his fellowship Sorts with your feelings. Pul. 'T is a doleful thing, That our gay world can yield a healthy man No company but lunatics or rogues: The wise are villains, and the honest fools. Lord! what a raking mid the weeds there is, To find one modest flower in all the crop! Sal. I prophecy a cardinal's cap for you, If you will preach thus in the market-place. I must be off. O, Pulti, Pulti, Pulti, If ever man loved man, I dote on you! [Exeunt.] SCENE V. The Great Hall of the Castle. A feast spread. At which are seated the Marquis and Marchioness di Tiburzzi, Marsio, Costanza, Filippia, Juranio, and other Guests. Servants in waiting. Enter Pulti, and stands behind Marsio. Then enter Salvatore, and seats himself. Marquis. We wait you, signore. Salvatore. Pardon my delay: My need was urgent. Marsio. I have kept the wine. Our cups, o'erbrimming with the sunny juice, Stand to attend you. Sal. 'T was a needless pause. I never taste the vintage. By your leave, I'll use the grape, as nature gives it to us, Thus, in the ripened fruit. For I hold wine To be a most ingenious fraud of Satan's; Who is so ready to change Heaven's best gifts Into some tempting form of sin. 'T is true A healthy apple cozened mother Eve; But I have wondered at that barefaced trick Upon the simple woman. Why did not The guileful devil change it into cider, And gull her handsomely? My kinsman, too, Is of my way of thinking. Juranio. I! what, I! Why, Salvatore, I would quaff a sea Of the rich earthly Lethe, were our night Stretched to a polar length. Mar. You hear him, sir: The Count is wild for wassail. You will not Refuse my lady's health? 'Sblood! should this dog Lap water only? Pulti, is it done? [Apart to Pulti.] Pulti. You'll find it so.âHo! ho!â [Laughing.] Mar. Hist! be discreet. [Apart to Pulti.] Sal. I will not balk you, to be curious. A toast, a toast! Mar. Rise, sirs. Our union! [They drink.] Sal. Simple and pregnant. Cleopatra's pearl Suffers discredit by your tasteful pledge. I drank it, with good relish, to the dregs; Ay, and forgot my enmity to wine, In seeing with what gust you boused it down. Mar. You flatter me. Your kinsman holds his peace: I hope I touched him. Sal. Him! Why, look you, now; His cup is dry,âthe very moisture gone: Heavens! what a fiery thirst! Costanza. Your lover's spirits Mount to a wondrous height. It makes one sad To see a man so merry. Filippia. Wait a while, And his high spirits shall fly off with you. Cos. You have a hopeful fancy: it must be A sorry thing to mark its failures. Fil. No; I have fresh hopes to help the lame ones on. They are like flowers that, dying, run to seed, And multiply the race.âSee, Marsio! March. What is the matter, signore? Mar. Nothing, nothing: A passing pain. Sal. You drink too eagerly. A sudden rush of wine into the frame Shakes it with spasms sometimes. Mar. Are you a leech? Physic yourselfâ'Sblood! March. Signore!â Mar. I am ill. [They all rise.] Sal. Pray will you test my leechcraft? Mar. I feel faint. Nay; I am stronger now. Come hither, Pulti. What does this mean? Pul. I cannot tell. Mar. Those men, Those devilish villainsâPulti, do you see them?â Look well and merry. Ere this time, the snakes Should have crawled homeward, with their venom in. The poison but fulfils what nature skipt: While IâAugh! Pultiâ [Apart to Pulti.] Pul. Let me see. (Runs to the table.) O, Lord! O! signore Marsio is poisoned! O! The cups are changed. You drank theâ Mar. Traitor, hold! Or I will cut you to the belt! March. Good heaven! Poisoned? Marq. Is this your plot? Youâ Sal. Wait the issue. [Apart to the Marquis.] March. Run, runâa doctor! Mar. Forty thousand doctors Were forty thousand short. Cos. How feel you, signore? Mar. Out! smooth drab!âO!âO! Sal. You have sprung the trap, But caught yourself for game. Mar. Who did this thing? Sal. I. Mar. Hear! he confesses it. Seize on themâ Juranio and that manâmy murderers! March. Ay; seize them, seize them! [The Guests draw.] Sal. Patience, gentlemen, I make you no resistance. On my honor, I will not try to fly. Mar. A poisoner's honor! Mercy, what a pang! 'Sdeath! an officerâ Send for an officer! Quick, quickâbreak upâ I do denounce them bothâwe'll have no feast! Sal. Ay, but we will; a marriage, too. Mar. How, how? Sal. We'll use Juranio, when you are gone. Mar. Ah, dog! may your tongue rot! Sal. Before you, signore? Mar. Silence the miscreant! Are you men, to seeâ O, heaven! these pains! Ju. What means this, Salvatore? Sal. Peace, my dear boy; the time is mine. Mar. You thinkâ You twoâyour countship and that pliant ladyâ You think, I say, when the grave swallows me, To wed?âHa! do ye? If the dead can riseâ And I will up! I'll haunt you till ye pray To sleep beside me. I will crawl between Your eager kisses with my wormy lips; I'll eat with you; I'll drinkâI'll drink againâ O, heaven! some water, water! I consumeâ Till all my flesh has rotted from me. Gods! Ha! ha! I'll make a merry guest! You wretchâ Now I feel easierâyou Salvatore, I'll fight with you, through all your odious days, Until I drive you in your grave. O! curse you! Do I look better? I may yet be well. O! O! these searching cramps! Where do you go? Come back, I say! I will not die alone! I do denounce themâPulti, Pulti too. Seize themâseize all! Have pity on me, Heaven! I willâI will!âThe room is full of smoke. Cut down the poisoners! I am not dead yet! [Draws, rushes at Juranio, and falls.] O! mercy, heaven! O! curse youâO! [Faints.] Sal. Well done! He shows his death-bed in perspective. March. Base, Base man, to glory in your victim's death! Sirs, apprehend him. [The Guests advance.] Sal. Gently, gentlemenâ I use my cutlery with the best of youâ Marsio 's not dead. A simple opiate Caused all this terror. Fil. 'T is ill news, but true. Find out some den to keep this monster in. [Servants carry off Marsio.] Sal. Wake from your apathy! You stand like marble. Cos. I never dreamed such horrors. Ju. What, not dead? March. O! joy, joy, joy! Sal. Call in your priest and notary. Are they in waiting? Marq. As I promised you. But I can scarcely see my way through this. (Enter a Priest and a Notary.) Sal. I am your pilot: trust me. Marq. As you will. Sal. Now sign this paper, lady; and you, Count. 'T is hasty, not dishonorable. Keep faith. Cos. How, sir! Ju. But, Salvatore, Marsio lives. Sal. He lives a felon! And I roundly swear, If you two people are not wed to-night, I'll have him hung upon a moving gallows, And wheel him after you around the world. I'll have no trifling. March. Marsio a felon! Sal. He sought to poison Count Juranio, And honored me by joining me with him. Where are you, Pulti? Pulti. Here, sir. Room, room, room, For Marsio's prime minister of drugs! This vial, and my oath, might go some lengths To speed his journey to a hotter world. Advance my relique! [Salvatore shows the vial.] March. O! the horrid viper! What an escape poor, dear Costanza made! Sal. You still hang back? Cos. My father still is bound. Sal. He is well cared for. Ere another day, I pledge myself to buy your father's debts At my own price. 'Sdeath! do you falter now? My lord, your promise. Marq. I command you, daughter: Obey my friend. March. Is Count Juranio rich? [Apart to the Marquis.] Marq. Pshaw! madam. Cos. I obeyâperhaps too kindly; But the mere thought of your security Sends my heart upward, like a loosened bird, Dizzy with hope, and strength, and ecstasy; For I am free again! (Turns to Salvatore.) To you I owe More than a common show of gratitude; But, now, forgive me; my o'erflowing thoughts Would drown the happy prospect of my speech, By sheer abundance of their offerings. To you, Juranioâ Ju. Nay, dear Costanza, Let my heart whisper what your words might be. Sal. Hide all your roses in your lover's breast. Go talk it over, goâwe'll never lookâ Then come to us, and notary and priest Shall knit you up. Ju. Dear kinsmanâ Sal. Silence, sir! This place is nauseous with stale sentiment. Mind your affairs; I 've business of my own. Fair lady, have I won? Fil. Yes, Salvatore. [Giving her hand.] Would it were worthier! Sal. Not for my sake, love: You cannot add a morsel to content. Marq. Peace crown you all! I have such friends, at last, As money could not buyâthe gifts of heaven: I thank it humbly. As for Marsio, He'll wake to-morrow, and behold what gulfs Crime opens 'twixt the richest criminal And the frank brotherhood of honest men, However poor,âgulfs that must yawn forever!

Time, Beginning of the reign of George II. ACT I. SCENE I. A Street in London. Enter Sir William Travers and Lord Guy Ruffler. Travers. Guy, I will not! This dodging petticoats Round the street-cornersâpeeping into shopsâ Leering, with shameless meaning, under hoodsâ Staring hot blushes into modest cheeksâ And fancying a favor if you catch A wandering glanceâis sheer against my manhood. Tut! man, you slander all your female kin By this procedure. Ruffler. (Looking off.) Do I?âPah! look there: Into the goldsmith's shop! Can they not see That I am looking at them? Travers, come, We'll enter, too: I want a ringâa chain.â 'Sblood! are the women fools? Trav. There seem to be Two fools among them. Ruf. Speak you for yourself? Stand here a while. Trav. For what? To be the butt Of my sharp self-contempt? Ruffler! [Shaking him.] Ruf. (Still looking off.) Hey! Trav. Nay; I'm talking to you. Ruf. As my grandmother. Trav. You need it. Look you, listen to me, Guy; Do you hold woman of no higher useâ Ruf. Pish! let me go: I 've business in that shop. Unhand me, pray. [Struggles to get away.] Trav. No, sir, you shall not go. I cannot see an insult thrust upon A modest woman; and the man who can, Without his nature flaming into wrath, And his arm lifting with instinctive might, Deserves to have his sisters, mother, wife, Tossed in together at a city's sack, While he looks on in powerless agony. Ruf. You could not please them better. What a stir, Among the velvets and the damasked silks, There was when the invading French were feared! What rubbing up of jewels, what a dust Among old finery! How some delicate maid Would squeak, in her high treble, âDear mamma, They say those monsters do not spare the weak: Let us be caught as ladies!â Then the dame Would smooth her powder, with a gentle sigh Of patient resignation. On my life, I never saw the women in such feather! You 'd thought the land was dressed for holiday, Not for invasion. All the time, we men Stood trembling, like huge jellies, for our throats; While our brave womenânow, you see, I praise themâ Made nothing of their honors! Trav. Monstrous stuff! I would not share your notions of the sex, To win a tribe of Helens. I can see, Within the simple innocence and truth Of uncorrupted woman, a fair spirit, Ranked, by all-seeing Heaven, not far beneath Its sinless denizens. Ruf. (Laughing.) Now Heaven forgive His wicked blasphemy! I'll draw you woman, According to her earthly character, Not as your poets make her. Woman, Will, Is animated vanity. A toy Made up each morning, by a forward whim, That scarcely lasts the day through. The same sigh Over a broken fan, or a broken heart, Measures her depth of feeling. A long stare At the last fashion, on a rival's back, Shows her ambition. A conspicuous seat At church, or theatre, where she may be The conscious centre of a thousand eyes, Shows her religion, or her taste. The power To bear hot sentiment, and frigid love, Her soul's endurance proves. Ask her to give Her hero's character, and when you have The color of his eyes, and hair, and cloak, You'll praise her nice perception. See her weed Her eyebrows of gray hairs, or paint her cheeks, And there 's her industry, and love of art. Come to her death-bedâ Trav. Nay. Ruf. Well, end her there: The thing is soulless, and can go no further. Yet, for all this, a very pretty doll For man to dandle. Trav. If the heavens be just, You'll pay this one day. Guy, I reverence woman. Ruf. For what? Here 's a discovery, indeed! For what? Trav. For many things. And yet there is One thing I never fully understood,â Love, love. Ruf. Why, that 's the simplest thing on earth. Trav. The very simplest! Were you e'er in love? Ruf. Always. Trav. With whom? Ruf. With everything that wears More than a yard of velvet in its skirts. You are a world too wise for happiness. Trav. The man who looks for it beyond himself Is a mere fool. But, Ruffler, I intend To marry shortly. Ruf. Heaven preserve your victim! What, you'll set traps, ha? Scheme her to your bed? Play on her weakness? and declare, the while, How much you reverence her; as travellers say Some pagans do, who flog unmercifully Their painted gods, and worship them, by turns. You talk of taking a poor maid, as though She were an oyster.âHist! they leave the shop, And come this way. Trav. In decency retire. Ruf. Not I, by Jove! Trav. To please me, Guy. Ruf. Poh! poh! You are too much humored. Trav. For a moment, then, Until I can escape. Ruf. Well, well; come on. A woman, more or less, is little gained, And nothing lost. Sneak, dodge;âI am with you. [They walk up the stage.] (Enter Lady Goldstraw and Madge.) Lady Goldstraw. La! they are there again. It is too bad: I cannot walk abroad, to feel the sun, Without these shadows following. Every day A pack of courtiers dog me to my door; Or walk before me, dropping billet-doux; And one, but Thursday lastâI tell you, Madgeâ Cast a French plume, that must have cost the knave A good ten pound, in hope I would return it. Madge. And did you not? Lady G. Not I, you silly child! I set my little foot upon it, thus, And ground it in the mire; to show my pride, And brave, contemptuous spirit. Mark those men: See how the tall one eyes me. Ha! ha! ha! [Laughing.] A proper fellow, too, and bravely trimmed: A courtier, doubtless. I do wonder, now, If 't was that villain twitched my dress and sighed, As we came through the church-door!âMercy! Madge, Don't stare so at them. Fie! you naughty child, I'm blushing for you. Marry! when you 've seen As many men as I, you'll know a way To cut your eyes at them, that stirs them more Than all your rustic glares. Madge. Come, mother, come. Yon jackanapes is grinning like death's head, With much the same expression; and his friend Has great ado to keep him back. I fear The coxcomb will be saucy. Lady G. Will he, rogue?â Let him: I'll give him better than he sends. Why, things have reached a pass, when pretty women Are at the beck of every handsome dog That strolls the streets! My husband, the Lord Mayorâ Madge. Tell me the story as we pass along. Yon bear will slip his keeper, if we stay. Lady G. So, then,âbut how you hurry me away! [Exit with Madge.] (As they go off, enter Darkly.) Ruf. (Advancing.) Darkly! Darkly. Forsooth. Ruf. âForsooth!â Geneva-cloak! You end of texts, and stupid homilies, You all that 's bad in every Christian sect, Do you âforsoothâ me, sirrah, ha? Dark. Amen! Ruf. A fool! you sin-begotten tag-rag! What, Are you pranked up, now, in your holy mood? Come, saint, lay by your amaranthine crown, And track those women. Dark. Ah! Ruf. You sigh! you'll groan When you have gotten to the martyrdom, I am preparing for your sainthood. Dark. O! Trav. Guy, if hard knocks can break a road to heaven, You 're on the way. The man has honest scruples; Do not outface his conscience. Ruf. Have you scruples?â Have you a conscience?âHave you anything That hints at honesty within your dirt? I'll put him to the question. (Seizes Darkly.) Answer me! Dark. The Lord forbid! Trav. Indeed! Ruf. Of course. Go, knave! Dark. Why should I follow the profane of earth, The painted instruments of thy desire? Ruf. Because I order. Dark. Bear me witness, sir, Here, in this world, and at the last account, I sin by man's compulsion. Trav. Truly! Dark. Ah! [Exit.] Ruf. A wretch like that would ornament the Shades, And put the little devils to the blush, Make Satan pine with envy, and upset Chaos itself. I never saw his twin. The club of Hercules could hardly drive One hand to pen a love-song, while the other Pilfered his lion-skin, with ohs and ahs Enough to raise a whirlwind. (Enter Harry Goldstraw.) Trav. Who is this? What, Harry Goldstraw? Happily met again. We were in Rome togetherâmind you, sir?â That day the miracle would hardly workâ You know the virgin that did roll its eyes?â Because the rain had rusted something, ha! Much to the Church's scandal. Goldstraw. Ay; and you To Fra Anselmo, a most bitter papist, Did seriously offer to anoint The clockwork with the chrism, and let the Pope Go home ungreased. âChe, che?â he cried. âBecause, Fra,â you replied, âthe Pope's eyes roll without it!â Trav. My friend, Lord Ruffler, Mr. Goldstraw. (They bow.) Boys, Let 's shake up London with a revel. How, Goldstraw, you flinch? Gold. I have a reason, sir. You saw two ladies passâ Ruf. I told you so: Here is another hound upon the scent. Look you, Will Travers, men are all the same; You are the only Joseph upon earth. So you were trailing them? O! never mind; We will not quarrel; we'll divide them justly. Take the old woman; give me the young thing: I have a taste for unripe fruit.â Gold. My lordâ Ruf. Well, you may wince, but so fate orders it. A fairer piece of Eve I never saw Than the young baggage. You 'd have laughed to see The little creature stare at me. Trav. A look Full of pure modesty, and more designed For me than you. Ruf. A most immodest leer. Hear, the vain puppy, how he claims her glance! Gold. I pray you, listenâ Ruf. As for your share,âphew! Think what a bundle of fine clothes you'll haveâ What pots of paintâhow many different wigsâ What an array of teeth, all movable, And warranted to baffle time's decay! And then her cotton;âwhy, an Indiaman Carries no greater cargo! Whalebone too! A very female Jonah, all encased In the sea-monster's ribs! And markâ Gold. My lord, Know you of whom you speak? Ruf. Not I, in faith: Some lady of the suburbs, I suppose, Who 'd bargain for her girl. You frown? 'Ods blood! Who is the woman, then? Gold. My aunt. Ruf. The devil! Trav. Shame on you, Guy! You 've given a sorry wound To the best nature ever lodged in man. See how a loose tongue, like an archer, blind With the thick dust of battle, shoots its shafts, With undiscerning aim, at foe or friend. Down on your knees! Ruf. Your pardon. Here 's my hand; Or, if you like it better, here 's my sword; Both at your service. Gold. By your leave, my lord, I'll take the hand; it seems an honest one, Though somewhat hasty. Trav. Spoken like brave men! The sword should be a backward arbiter. If human weakness can forgive a wrong, Without blood spilled, let it be done; for soâ By just such steps of charity and loveâ We climb to heaven. Ruf. Alas! I scarcely know How to implore your confidence again. You seem to bear a grief about with you, That I, perhaps, might lighten. Trav. Harry, speak. A truer mind, and a more slippery tongue, A better heart, and a more idle head, Were never bundled up in stranger sort Than in Guy Ruffler. Ruf. When I go to service, My master shall not get my character From you, my boy. Gold. Alas! the character You gave my aunt fills up my former grief. That you, a stranger, by a casual glance, Should come so near the thing she really is, Gives me a sorrowful conclusion. Sheâ But I'll not talk. Come to her house with me; Where, if you be true friends, you may behold Things more for tears than laughter. Trav. Ah! I see. Gold. No, sir, you cannot see, with eyes like mine, The open folly and the vanity With which she stains my uncle's troubled grave,â The faithful guardian of my orphanage, Whose fragrant memory sheds no balm on her, Amid the train of fops and fashionists That flutter round her gold, in buzzing swarms; Slaves whose mere presence would disgust the sense Of many a wanton. All these things have sprung, Not from her heart, which, at the root, is good; But by the culture of such poisoned sprouts As grow upon the surface of our nature,â Self-love and vanity. But come; I'll preach More by example, if you feel inclined. Trav. Nay, Harry, quit these dumps. A woman's whims Are all too light to bow so strong a soul. Ruf. I'll find a way to cure her malady. I never saw a woman yet of stuff I could not mould, as wax before a fire. Some merry plot, half serious and half gay, I'll plan. I undertake it, sir; and what I undertake, I do. Trav. Go to! Here is [Patting Ruffler.] My Vanity, my Ego, my great Me: Match any woman with him, if you can! [Exeunt.] SCENE II. A Reception-Room in Lady Goldstraw's House. Enter Madge. Madge. When will my mother hold her years to be Beyond man's courtship? O! it sickens me To see her deck her ruins with bright flowers,â Through which the ugly seams will peep, withal,â While I, who, in the course of nature, am as fit For flowers as Spring is, shut my roses up, And pine beneath her. Child, forsooth! A child Of twenty summers, who must know its bounds, Its nursery, its book, its pretty toy; Rise with the lark, and lie down with the lamb;â Must I, indeed?âwhile she makes daybreak blush To see her revels, and high noon amazed To catch her sleeping. If I knew a man, Of all her tribe, worth lovingâNot so fast: There 's cousin Hal, worth all the bearded race; But what cares he? Would I were not his cousin! Ah, well! Hal is so modest too: a fashion That went out with the tilting-spears and shields. Poor chivalry! they scorn you; but you died Rather for lack of heroes, to renew Your drooping laurels, than your own misdeeds. If I were HalâHow he torments me! (Enter Lady Goldstraw.) Lady Goldstraw. Child, You must be jogging: your embroidery Needs a few stitches, and your French has gone The saints know where! Madge. The saints know little, madam Of where the French go. If the French goâ Lady G. Fie! Your tongue is idler than your hands. Go, go; Get to your book. I spoil you, silly child, By my indulgence. Madge. Nay; I think you spoil My mother more by your indulgence. Lady G. Mistress, Would you be pert? Madge. Not if I could respect. Pray hear me, mother. Lady G. To your room, I say! I'll cool your blood upon a water diet,â Impudent nursling! Madge. Madam! Lady G. To your room! [Exit Madge.] O! what a fume she put me in! I fear My poor complexion has not stood the shock Of this emotion. (Looks at a mirror.) Yes; a fair escape! No crack nor line, and not a hair awry. Prior! (Enter Nick Prior.) Who waits below? Nick. Why, Master Hopeful, mam. Hope 's first to come, and last to go away. Lady G. No words! Admit him. Now, I wonder why This whole house treats me with such disrespect? [Aside.] Go, sir! I'll get a master for you, sirrah, To swinge you roundly. Nick. How the old girl shines! She must have varnished down her paint to-day. [Aside. Exit.] Lady G. Ho! here he comes. Lie still, my little heart! Why wilt thou flutter, tender fool? Ah me! [Sinks into a chair.] (Enter Hopeful. Ruffler, Travers, and Goldstraw, enter behind, observing the scene.) Hopeful. Queen of my soul, sweet agony of bliss, Adored deceiver! daylight is agog To see thy coming; though bright PhÅbus knows Thy light will shame him! Wherefore, wherefore, wherefore, Cruel eye of beauty, didst thou keep thy slave Sitting upon a hall-stool? Has thy heart No sympathetic thrill to waste upon Joints stiffened in thy service, rheumatisms Beyond red flannel and mustard? Lady G. Faithless bard, What, dost thou murmur at thy bondage, then? I could well-nigh forbid your lips to press The lilies of this hand. [Extends her hand, which he kisses.] Hope. Nay, mistress mine, My grief is closed within my placid heart, As those fair lilies when they fold to rest Upon thy snowy bed-quilt. Hear, O, hear! [Takes out a paper.] This sonnet to thy glory. Little, lady, Compared with their sweet source, the verses seem; As rivers which seem trifles to their springsâ Nay, I am out somehow. (Aside.) But give thy ear To this soft melody of PhÅbus's. [Reads.] O! ever-to-be-remembered day and night! O! never-to-be-forgotten ecstasy! O! sun-god, with thy sky-born eyes, day-bright, O'er-look the song-soul of thy votary! O! teach his love-pen how to soothly write Of the not-now-forgotten hour, when I Poured out my love-words to the worthiest wight That wends, heart-bound, beneath ceruleous sky! O! dip my ink-dried pen in Ã¡ sunsÃ©t; Roll out a white-cloud scroll, without a flaw; For sand, powder a storm-cloud up; and get Venus to set her silvern taper, for To light thy Poet; and one name he'll set Across the sky, and it shall beâGoldstraw! Lady G. A sweet, sweet sonnet! much in Petrarch's way. Yours is a pretty gift of poesy. Hist! be discreet. Hope. I hear profane strong steps; Much like a man with heavy boots might make. Lo! rivals, madam! Lo! the slaves that tear My heart out, and destroy my appetite! (Enter Lord Foam, Sir John Pollen, and Marks.) Lady G. Fair welcome, gentlemen! You have missed muchâ The poet's latest verse. Read it again. Hope. At thy command I would do much. But, no, No common ear shall list to holy verse. Yet if you willâ Marks. Don't break yourself for us; Keep something back to live on. Foam. La! they say Your verse is stale before the ink gets dry. Hope. They wrong me foully! Pollen. (Aside to Hopeful.) At him! In my dayâ In Flanders, yonderâI have seen a throat Cut for less insults. By the devil's blood! I smell a coward. Hope. Cut the miscreant's gorge, Here, in this presence! Pol. Ay; and fling his head Into her lap. When we were leaguers, bully, Down there at Antwerp, an old Spanish Don One morning sent his mistress, by the post, The heads of all her twenty paramours, Strung on a rope like onions. Hope. Horrible! Brought they no tears into her woman's eyes? Marks. No, sir; she did not peel them. Pol. Look you, sir, I am a soldier. Marks. Then, thank Heaven, I am not. Foam. La! fairly struck! Good boy, good boy! I kiss Your worship's hand. Pol. Small shot and thunder! Turks, I'll teach your tonguesâ [Lady Goldstraw faints, supported by Hopeful.] Hope. Hold, ruffians! Look here, And see your handiwork. Pol. 'Ods bayonets! Twitch her nose, Foam. Hope. Who twitches dies the death! Foam. A fan, a fan, la! Merchant, bring a fan! Marks. âA fan!â No; bring some water. All. (Running about.) Water, water! Lady G. (Starting up.) No; bring no water; I am not afire. Marks. Nor do you use fast colors for your cheeks, Or water would not wake you. [Aside.] Pol. Blood and drums! I beg for quarter. Lady G. Water me, forsooth! Do I look withered? Hope. Spare, my gracious queen, [Kneels.] The wretch who kneels before you, and inclines His lips unto your shoe-string! Lady G. For his sake, I spare you all. Marks. Had I your guineas safe, I 'd spare your sparing. [Aside.] Foam. La! how kind you are! Hope. A royal amnesty! Lady G. But leave me, sirs; My nerves are shattered. Hope. Misery, misery! Pol. 'Swounds! This thing has fallen like a ten-pound shell Among a company. Hope. O! pardon, pardon! Lady G. I pardon all. Go, I implore! Foam. Adieu! [Exit, gayly.] Marks. 'Sdeath! must I lose more interest? [Aside. Exit.] Pol. Soul of me! Where shall I dine to-day? [Aside. Exit.] Hope. O! agony! I did not read my sonnet to them. (Aside.) Ha! [Starting.] One look, and then the pall of midnight falls! [Exit, wildly.] Lady G. One cheek has cracked: I felt it giving way When they cried âwater.â Doll, what, Doll, I say! Ha! there 's the handsome stranger of the street; And come to court me, doubtless. Lack-a-day! O! had those brutes cried anything but âwater!â [Exit.] (Ruffler, Traverse, and Goldstraw, advance.) Ruffler. O! such a farce! Traverse. Such actors too! But, Hal, Where is your cousin? Goldstraw. Prisoned by my aunt; Kept out of sight. Blooming and withering Show ill in company. Ruf. Such vanity I 've heard of.â Trav. Practised. Ruf. How? Trav. Why, in yourself; Is not all womankind in love with you? Ruf. That 's not my fault. Trav. Guy, you are sharp enough For others' follies, stone-blind to your own. Ruf. Bah! hang your sermons! Goldstraw, I 've a plan Working within me, but scarce formed as yet. Let us to Travers' lodgings; where I'll lie Till time has brought my struggling thought to light. Trav. Onward!âBut, Hal, if widow, maid, or wife, Should look upon us, as we pass along, Pray you remember, all the sweetest looks Belong by right to Ruffler; all the frowns To us, by imposition. Forward, then! [Exeunt.] ACT II. SCENE I. Travers' Lodgings. Ruffler, Travers, and Goldstraw, discovered. Travers. Your plot comes hardly, Ruffler. Ruffler. Not at all: But, as you say, if the old lady's follies Could reach the end they aim at, she would find A keen repentance following her success. She must be married; that 's the starting-point. Goldstraw. âMarried!â Nay, that 's the ending-point, I fear. For, in a furious outburst of her folly, Or by the coming of some needy fellow, Of handsome person and adroit designs, She may be cozened to clap up a match, Either with one who dangles in her train, Or an adventurer who will spend her wealth, Rob my poor cousin of her heritage, And break both hearts together. Trav. A shrewd fear. For, Guy, suppose yourself a ruined man; How easy would it be to mend your rents With Lady Goldstraw's patches! Ruf. True enough. Trav. 'T is well all sharpers have not your address, Or heaven protect rich widows! Ruf. Hum! Suppose That I should marry her. [Laughing.] Trav. He takes the bait. [Aside.] 'Sdeath! what a life you 'd lead her! It would cure Her amorous fancies till her dying day. Lord! how she 'd shy, and try to throw you off, And how you 'd cling and spur! I understand: Married in jest, by Darkly, or some knave With reverend face;âjust for a day or so? 'T would work like poison. Ah! you cunning dog, What nimble wits you have! [Laughing.] Gold. Yes; how they skip, When Travers pulls the wires! [Aside.] Ruf. Well, there 's my plan; Born by due course of nature, as you see, Without the aid of doctors. Trav. Brava, wife! No; pshaw! you gull us. What, you will not dare To carry out your artful project, man? I doubt your courage. Hal, what think you, Hal? Gold. I would be loath to see her ladyship The victim of a plot. Trav. Yet, after all, Could it exceed the antics of to-dayâ The lovers, and the sonnet, and the swoon? And why not touch her feelings, and awake The torpid heart that smothers in her follies, And makes her monstrous? Ruffler's scheme is goodâ Excellent, exquisite, without a flawâ And easily practised. Ruf. Ay, simplicity, That 's your true mark of genius! Gold. I'll consider. Ruf. Nay, now, you shall consent. I will not have The travail of my brain miscarry quite Through stupid counsel. 'T is the only way; And if you shrink, I'll offer no more plans. Live on, and suffer by your obstinacy. Gold. What think you, Travers? Trav. Soberly, I think The plot a sound one: and, besides, if he Wring the old lady past her sufferance, We can remit; for then the cure will be, Beyond a doubt, accomplished. Gold. I consent. But deal as a good surgeon; give no pain Where pain is needless; cut the cancer out, But spare the patient. Ruf. Mark me, gentlemen; I'll have no interference; you must be But instruments, not artists, in my work. Prepare yourselves for orders. Trav. We'll obey. [Ruffler struts up the stage.] Gold. Travers, I never saw such vanityâ Of all complexions, shapes, and shadesâin man. He takes your thoughts out of your very teeth, Swallows, and casts them up, as carelessly As though your brain were his. Trav. (Laughing.) And so it is. His weakness does not hide his nobler parts From my respect. We'll hit upon some way To cure both patients with one medicine. (Enter Darkly.) Ruf. (Seizing him.) Where have you tarried? By the holy rood, I feel like basting you! Darkly. Swear Christian oaths! Do not afflict me with the filth of Romeâ The bells, the candles, or the holy roodâ The graven images, or painted saintsâ The monks, or bulls, or other hornÃ©d beastsâ Theâ Trav. Peace! you hypocrite, you sightless mole, Who burrow in the dirt and lees of things, Nor see the flowers that root in the decay Of Roman greatness, to delight our time! Peace, wretch! that ancient church held up a torch, To light our fathers through the utter gloom Of feudal ignorance! Learning lived in her; Her cloisters saved the wondrous minds that made Greece beautiful and Rome imperial. What if she lag behind this rapid age? Is she not old? and age claims man's respect. What if the daylight show the torch's smoke? Did it not serve us in the middle night, And light us towards the morning? Rome, thou fool! There 's not a church, from Luther to George Fox, That on her broad foundations is not built! Ruf. You hurl a thunderbolt against a gnat. Peace, father Will! Trav. You heard the villain prate. I am no Papist, yet it angers me To see that noble bulwark of our faith Touched with irreverent hands. Ruf. Well, sirrah, well! Where have you been? Dark. I tarried round the house Of the gay gentile, near the offices, Over against the backside of the court; And there I saw her handmaids and her men Bear the repast to its allotted place. Ruf. (Mimicking him.) And, peradventure, thou didst enter in, To fill thy inward man with broken meats. Yea, and I marvel that thou didst not burst Thy hide with stuffing. For, bethink thee, brother, It falls on fast-day, when it is thy use To cram thee grossly, just to scorn the church. Dark. Yea, verily. Ruf. Out, glutton! Dark. And it chanced, A maid of comly mien, and smooth of skinâ Ruf. How did you know the texture of her skin? Dark. In divers ways. Ruf. Ugh, losel! Dark. And I called, And said unto the maid, in modest tongueâ Ruf. With a most filthy leer. Dark. Whose habitation, Or whose dwelling-place, dost thou abide in? And she answered me, âThe Lady Goldstraw's, Widow to a mayor of mighty London; A brave and portly dame, stricken in years, But full of amorous blood.â And who the damsel? I questioned; and she made reply, âYoung Madge, A child of twenty summers.â So I rose, And came my way. Ruf. Unconscionable liar! You have been nobbing in stale beer with her, Eating cold pasties; and, for after cates, You stole a brace of kisses. Come, put on Your sanctimonious garb, and follow me.â Are you prepared? [To Travers and Goldstraw.] Trav. Yea, verily! Gold. In sooth! Dark. O, O, alas! how the profane ones scoff! [Exeunt.] SCENE II. An Ante-Room in Lady Goldstraw's house. Enter Travers and Madge. Travers. So love died long ago? Madge. When Venus died, With her three Graces, and the Golden Age Came limping downward to these prosy days Of gain and reason. If we marry now, 'T is this lord's park wedding that lady's field; Or this man's money-bags and that dame's plate, Joined at compounded interest; or John's arm Mated to Polly's thrift. Or give the theme A wider scopeâthrow wealth and sense asideâ And then 't is folly caught by beauty's glare; Or base desire asking the church's seal, To sin by charter; or sad loneliness Seeking companionship; or simple malice Seizing a helpless victim to torment, While the law nods approval; orâorâorâ For any motive, good or bad, you please, But not for love. Love has no motives, sir, No purposes, no aims, no selfish wish; Love is its own reward. Trav. Indeed! then love For nothing sighsâfor nothing groans and weepsâ For nothing wrings his hands, and tears his hair; Or with this nothing being enraged, for nothing He fires a house, or cuts a rival's throat, Or leads the Greeks into a ten years' war, And tumbles blazing Ilium o'er her walls: And all for nothing! Madge. Then was love a god; Men demi-gods, who stalked through history A head and shoulders taller than the world: Ah! there were heroes then! Trav. And heroes now. Are heroes proven by the knocks they take?â Is blood the only livery of renown? I knew a sickly artisan, a man Whose only tie to life was one pale child, His dead wife's gift. Yet, for that single tie, He bore a life that would have blanched the face Of armÃ©d Hector; bore the hopeless toil, That could but scrape together one day's food; Bore the keen tortures of a shattered frame, The sneer of pride, the arrogance of wealth; All the dread curses of man's heritage, Summed in one word of horrorâpoverty!â Ay, bore them with a smile. And all the time, His ears were full of whispers. In his hand, The common tools of work turned from their use, And hintedâdeath! The river crossed his path, Sliding beneath the bridge, so lovingly, And murmuringâdeath! Upon his very hearth The tempter sat, amid the flaming coals, And talked with him ofâdeath! A thousand ways Lay open, for his misery to escape; Yet there he stood, and labored for his child, Till Heaven in pity took the twain together.â He was a hero! Madge. Sir, you sadden me. Trav. Is man, then, so degenerate? Madge. On my faith, You prove the thing worth something. Trav. Would that I Could prove it in my person! Madge. Why? Trav. Fair Madge, I'd have you love me. Madge. Horrors! what a man! How many houses have you? How much land? How many guineas? Are your cattle fat? Could you afford a carriage? Sir, you see, Having no father, I must look to this, As you 'd be loved, in my own person. Come; Set up your claim. What settlement, Sir William, Can you make good upon my daughter? Trav. Sir, I am a hero of the Golden Age, Belated in your times. A love like mine Is its own blessed reward. I nothing seek; And, therefore, nothing will I give. My love Is an abstraction, a divine idea, That settles on your daughter, my good sir, For want of better habitation. Madge. Pshaw! You'll vex me, shortly: I abhor a quiz. Trav. Why, so do I; and hating thus myself, I leave myself, and cast my love on you. Madge. Which love is self-love, by your own confession. Trav. And being self-love, of the best quality Find me, between the poles, such tenderness As that men lavish on themselves; such sighs As they can utter o'er their private griefs; Such tears as their own miseries call forth; Such perfect and complete oblivion To all the world, for their own darling selves! It would shame Hero o'er Leander's corpse, To hear the anguish that a surgeon's knife Can waken in his patient. Madge. Farewell, sir! I'll hope to meet you in a graver mood. Trav. I shaped my mood by yours.âBut one word more. Suppose me grave; should I have credit, then? You shake your head. Pray, when will you believe? Madge. When I believe in love. [Exit.] Trav. I like thee, Madge: Would I could love thee, as thou dost deserve; But love!âO, fie! I'll swear I cannot love. Yet I must feign it; drop philosophy, And rave myself into a lunatic. I like thee, though, beyond a shade of doubt; And there 's a nature underlays thy mirth That well approves the feeling. 'T is full time I should set up a nursery, and prolong The race of Travers; or my father's bones Will rise against me. He who wills can win. [Exit.] (Enter Dolly Flare.) Dolly. My! what a handsome gentleman! How well He 'd look, if he had Mr. Darkly's way Of pious conversation! There 's a man The devil fears, I warrant! (Enter Darkly.) Darkly. Sister Flare, How is it with thee, sister? Dol. Poorly, thank Heaven! Dark. O! weaker vessel, dost thou feel the need Of faith, to steady thee? Dol. I fear I do. Dark. Um, um! faint soul, thou shalt not ask in vain The arm of succor, (Embracing her.) or the guiding hand. [Taking her hand.] And, peradventure, it might comfort thee To taste a morsel of refreshing strength: [Taking a bottle from his pocket.] Albeit, the spirit is strong, the flesh is weak, And cries for aid. (Gives the bottle. She drinks.) Yea, verily! alas! How much the poor soul needs! But go thy ways; My strength is waning, even as thine doth wax. [Takes the bottle from her.] When thou dost falter by the way, look up!â Even though this carnal vial cleave unto thee, Defy the tempter, and look up, I say! [Throws back his head, and drinks.] Dol. (Taking the bottle.) I will, indeed. O! sir, you have not left A drop to try my strength on. Dark. Marvel not: Sore was I tempted. Thou of little faith, O! frail of purpose, canst thou not look up? [She looks up, and he kisses her.] Dol. (Starting.) O! O! Dark. Does thy strength fail? Look up, I say! [She looks up, and he kisses her.] Dost thou feel easier? Is the tempter laid? Dol. I could look up forever. Dark. Verily, Thy faith is great, O, blessed sister Flare! Perchance I may abide beneath this roof; And if it happen, I will come to thee, Even to thy chamber, to exhort with thee, And wrestle with the tempter. Dol. Dear, good man! I don't deserve it, sir, indeed I don't: I feel so dismal-like, when you are nigh, And I can see your blessed face. O! O! I fear I am a sinner, sir! [Weeps.] Dark. Look up! [She looks up, he kisses her, and exit.] (Enter Ruffler and Goldstraw.) Ruffler. Here I am, Harry, in my best array. But where is Travers? Goldstraw. Somewhere hereabout: He strayed off with my cousin. Dolly, girl, What are you staring at? Ruf. A pretty maid!â Hist, hist! I'll wake her. [Steals up to kiss her.] Dol. (Striking him.) Out, tempter, out! Get thee behind me, Satan! [Exit.] Ruf. Blood of mine! What a she-devil! [Rubbing his face.] Gold. What has come o'er her? Ruf. Plague on her handling! Now, I tell you, Hal, That 's the first check I e'er received from woman. She 's taken me for you. Gold. Without a doubt. You 're welcome to the error. Ruf. Now, suppose I open on the widow. I intend To carry the whole matter through by storm. Who are within? Gold. Fools: the same silly crowd. You 'd better join them. Ruf. Mark me put them down, Clear the whole field, and catch the widow up Before she can draw breath.â Gold. Or hear a word That sounds like reason. Ruf. Ay, ay! Forward, then! Sound, trumpets! I am armed to win the day! [Exeunt.] SCENE III. A Room in the Same. Lady Goldstraw, Lord Foam, Sir John Pollen, Hopeful, and Marks, discovered. Hopeful. Star of our lives, make an election now. Behold thy four slaves suppliant at thy heels; [They kneel.] And all they beg, imperial dame of hearts, Is that thou 'lt choose, among their number, one, To make the partner of thy four-post bed. Would thou couldst honor all, and shame the Turk By a reversal of his way of life; Yet since vile law confines thee to but one, Choose from among us here the worthiest; And let the remnant of thy slaves depart, Covering their misery with their handkerchiefs. As for myselfâ [They all start up.] All. Hold, Hopeful! Pollen. Honor, honor! Marks. We chose you spokesman, and not advocate. You must not speak, or speak for all alike. Foam. La! yes; well put! Lady Goldstraw. How shall I choose aright, Where no one seems unworthy? Marry, sirs, A simple woman, immature in yearsâ Though wise beyond themâhere may hesitate, And hand upon the syllable of judgment. I like the martial air of bold Sir Johnâ Pol. 'Sdeath! yes: at Antwerpâ Hope. Peace! an angel blabs. Lady G. I like the manners of Lord Foamâ Foam. La, now! Lady G. The thrift of Marks; the wild poetic soul That throbs in Hopefulâ Hope. Glory to my queen! She chooses nicely. Marks. Cease your braying, ass, Until she chooses. Pol. (To Hopeful.) Breathe another word, And I will scour my rapier in your soul! Marks. Let us cast lots. Hope. Back, merchant! Slave, to thee!â [To Pollen.] What! dost thou scorn the poet? Flanders' knight, He of the lyre is master of the blade; Nor goes out, like a candle, at thy puff! Lady G. Beseech you, gentlemen!â Hope. Pray not for him: His cause doth soil the ruby of thy lip With present arsenic. On my angry sword Grim horror sits, and murder is about! Away! [The others seize him.] Pol. I pray you, hold him; he is mad. Lady G. O gentlemenâgood gentlemenâ Hope. Mad for your bleeding! Foam. La! be quiet, do! Marks. Peace, or I'll trounce you! Hope. Dost thou second him, Thou thing of measures, and plague-bearing rags? Receive thy wages! [Strikes Marks. All draw.] Lady G. Murder! murder! murder! Pol. Murder! I 'm slain! Foam. And I! (Enter Ruffler and Goldstraw.) Ruffler. Keep the king's peace! Hope. (Rushing at Ruffler.) Presuming toadstool, die! [Goldstraw strikes up his sword.] Goldstraw. Stand back! you know me. Hope. But I regard you not. Ruf. Ha! dogs, you snarl, You show your teeth, you bite, before a lady! Lady G. Marry! that they do, sir, and little else. Ruf. Are these your manners? This the high respect A man should show before yon paragon Of beauty, sweetness, and accomplished worth? Now, as I live, my heart takes fire indeed At the bare thought, and I would make you dance To the harsh music of this rapier!â Lady G. No moreâif you do love me. Ruf. Love you, sweet! See, one soft word has saved you. Vanish, then! I banish you her presence, one and all, Until our wedding-day. Hope. Man, dost thou think Thy clamor scares us? Pol. Poh, poh! soldiers, gull, Afraid of words! In Flanders, 'sdeath! the French Said ten words to our one. Marks. Ha, magpie, ha! You 'd steal our lady's gold! Foam. La! yes, indeed. Marks. We'll clip you close enough. (Enter Travers and Darkly.) Ruf. Here come allies. Draw out your battle; for I have resolved To drive you out, through yonder door, like thieves. (Ruffler and his friends range themselves on one side; the suitors on the other.) Travers. What is this folly? Marks. It has just come in, Along with you. Lady G. Entreat them to desist. O dear! my hair has gotten all awry; I must look dreadfully. [Aside.] Trav. Nay, gentlemenâ Marks. Pish! draw your sword, and sheath your tongue. Hope. Ay, slave, If you be mortal, we will find it out! Darkly. (Coming between.) Or, peradventure, if I might exhortâ Marks. Out, scarecrow! [Darkly retreats.] Trav. Taste your madness. [Draws.] Pol. Hold, by Mars! This looks like earnest. (Aside.) I proclaim a truce. Hope. Base-born deserter! Marks. Coward! Foam. La! and I Have no idea of getting my clothes spoiled. [Crosses with Pollen to Ruffler's party.] Pol. Why, sirs, we often did it, down in Flanders, To bury up the dead. A truce! a truce! A soldier asks it. Or, if you will fight, Throw down your arms, and beg for quarter. Marks. Hopeful, We are out-matched. Hope. I care not, I! Come on! The world shall witness how a bard goes off! [Advances.] Gold. This mummery has gone far enough. (Coming between.) Be still, Mad poetaster; and you, master Marks, Off to your counter, or I'll call the watch. Trav. A good idea. Pol. and Foam. Watch! watch! Marks. We will submit To Lady Goldstraw; but the best of you Shall not dictate at the sword's point to us. Hope. Speak, magnet of my heart! thy slaves prepare To do thy bidding. Lady G. Now, I really like That stranger's counsel, for the stranger's sake. [Aside.] Begone! I banish you. Yet, not to kill Your loving spirits, I'll mix sweet with sour,â Return again upon my wedding-day. Marks. Keep up your spirits: I, for one, have hope To be alive to see your funeral. [Exit.] Lady G. Ungrateful brute! Foam. La! so do I. [Exit.] Lady G. Mean fop! Pol. Good-morning to your paint! In faith, I 'd take The same leave of your face, if 't were in sight. [Exit.] Lady G. Ugh! slanderous warrior! Hope. Madness, madness, madness! A thousand hissing vipers gnaw your soul, The nightmare lie beside you, and may dreamsâ Grimmer than gorgons, hydras, and the likeâ Forever mind you of lost Thomas Hopeful! This marvellous world to me is black as soot! [Exit.] Lady G. Loving, but vicious! Trav. (Laughing.) 'T was a fearful scene! [Apart to Goldstraw.] Gold. But all a sham. You saw the cut-throats cool When âwatchâ was cried. Trav. Yet Ruffler swaggered bravely. Gold. Dear aunt, excuse me. This fierce gentleman, Who saved our lives, is Lord Guy Ruffler; famed For gallant deeds done in the field of Mars, And Cupid's, too. [Introducing them.] Lady G. My service to your lordship. Ruf. Nay, nay; command me, madam. Gold. Aunt, my friend, Sir William Travers. Lady G. (Apart to Goldstraw.) Are they both at Court? Gold. Yes, both in office; and Lord Ruffler, aunt, Is of great wealth, and greater expectation. Lady G. He seems to like me. Gold. Like you! Ah! I fear, 'T is more than liking. Lady G. Pshaw, you foolish boy! Well, well, I cannot see, but so it is, The men will fancy something in me still. A lonely widow; only I have worn Better than most, and youth yet lingers here With some small show of charms. Gold. I never saw Years touch one lighter; all the gayety Of youth is yours, without youth's rudeness, madam. Lady G. O fie! you flatter. Gold. (Apart to Ruffler.) I have smoothed your way: Her heart is open now to all mankind. Lady G. Lord Ruffler. [Goldstraw and Travers walk up the stage.] Ruf. Madam. Lady G. You are from the Court. Ruf. 'T is true, my lady. Lady G. Are there many there Of greater beauty than our city belles? Ruf. You jest. Lady G. How then? Ruf. I trust you know the worth Of the transcendent beauty stored in you; Your glass must brighten with it every day. Those eyes, that flash upon me, are not blind, Or heaven belies its light. Lady G. O dear! my lord, You are so sudden! I could scarce expect To hear such words at once. You frighten me.â See how my hand is shaking. Ruf. (Taking her hand.) Precious hand, That trembles at my lips; then, at my lips, Tremble forever. [Kisses it.] Lady G. O, O, let me go! 'T is cruel to use your strength; and I so weak! Ruf. I love you madly! Lady G. Ah! you fib, you doâ You know you doâyou naughty, naughty lord! Ruf. By those bright eyes I swearâand by that brow Of Parian whitenessâand those curving lips That match and rival the vermilion dye Brought from Cathayâand by those cheeks that blush The Persian rose to palenessâby this hand, Which now I hold, and never will release, I swearâand hear me Venus and young Loveâ To win a title that shall make it mine! Lady G. (Struggling.) Indeed, my lord, I'll call for help, I will, If you presume so. You are crushing meâ A poor weak womanâO, unhand me, O! Gold. (Advancing.) What is the matter? [As he advances, Ruffler releases her.] Lady G. Nothing, goose,âbegone! [Goldstraw retreats.] I must retire a while, indeed I must. Stay, if you willâI cannot help itâstay; But don't expect to see me. Lack-a-day! The fellow 's squeezed me out of shape, I know. [Aside, arranging her dress.] Ruf. Shall I not hope? Lady G. Hope is the guest of all; I cannot help it if you hope. Adieu! Sweet ruffian! [Aside. Exit.] (Travers and Goldstraw advance.) Ruf. Talk of wooing girls, forsooth! Hang me, if aught compares with wooing widows. The hopeful ease, the careless certainty,â Ah! that 's the thing to whet one's heart upon. Gold. She took it kindly? Ruf. âKindly!â that 's no word. But I am trammelled with another scrape. Trav. How 's that? Ruf. Why, look ye, as we came along, We met the pretty Madge, and, as I live, She gave me that same stare. Gold. She spoke to me. Ruf. Ay, but she looked at me. And let me tell youâ For I know all about these woman's waysâ A look goes further with them in a day, And means more too, than fifty thousand words. Gold. The boundless coxcomb! Madge, too! [Aside.] Trav. (Laughing.) Ha, ha! Guy, Keep your belief; you'll need it by and by. Ruf. What do you mean? Gold. Pish! sirs; let us go in. I have a cork to draw.âMy cousinâ'sdeath!â [Aside.] A jolly bottle of an ancient house, Ice to the lips, but fire within the blood; A liquid joy, that, in its native grape, Basked a whole summer through in old Provence, And rolled its pulpy fatness in the sun, And caught the spirit of the Troubadour, To kindle song amid our colder age! Ruf. Come, Travers, come, and crack the bottle. Ugh! This ancient love-making is somewhat dusty. I 'm dried up to a cinder with my flames. Where is the wine, Hal? Quick, my throat 's afire! [Exeunt.] ACT III. SCENE I. A Room in Lady Goldstraw's House. Enter Madge and Goldstraw. Goldstraw. Madge, can you keep a secret? Madge. Hal, it seems You cannot keep the one upon your lips. Gold. But it concerns you. Madge. Do I look concerned? Gold. Am I a fool, that you should answer thus? Madge. Am I town-crier, that you should fear to tell This secret which will burst you, if you hold A moment longer? Gold. Now, by Midas' ears, I will not trust you! Madge. Well, well; I'm content. Gold. No, you are not. Madge. Indeed! Gold. You 're mad to hear. Madge. And you to tell. Ah! cousin Hal, you men Call woman curious; but it would not be, If you wise mortals did not, from our births, Feed us on secrets. First, you tell your sins, Then slander us for knowing them. Now, I Have a great secret, that, when yours is out, I'll give unasked. Gold. A secret! pray, what is it? That Lady Picture paints?âMiss Wiggins' hair Grows on her French maid's head?âMiss Cripple's limp Accounts for the high price of cork this year?â That Mistress Flimsy's death was hastened on By swallowing her set of brilliant teeth, The day she heard Lord Faithless jilted her For Lady Lucre? For poor Flimsy's maid Told Lady Pop's, your cousin's maid, who told Nick Prior, your mother's footman, who told Maud, Your chambermaid, who told your seamstress, Blanche, Who told your Dutch nurse, who unguardedly Dropped it to Dolly Flareâet cetera. Why, Madge, a secret, such as you would tell, Has such a pedigree, before you reach The thing itself, as an old Hebrew king: I'd go to sleep before you came to it. Madge. Ho! ho! (Yawning.) There is a shameful saying, Hal, That fools and women talk with many words. Now, you are not a womanâ Gold. Then, a fool. Madge. A frank confession. Gold. Madge.â Madge. Hal? Gold. Madge.â Madge. Hal, again: What would you? Gold. Of this secret?â Madge. What, of yours? Gold. Well, then, of mine. Lord Guy, Travers, and I, Have formed a plan to cure your mother's whims.â Madge. How, all? And she a woman! Gold. No; the whim Of second marriage, with the ill it brings To your repose. Madge. O, take no thought for me: My secret will release you. Gold. 'Sdeath! you wasp, What is it? Madge. Finish yours. Gold. Thus far I will. Make no real opposition to our plot; Flatter Lord Ruffler, treat Sir William well; And be instructed, as we go along, Either by them or me. Will you consent? Madge. Is there no malice in it, no true grief, Intended towards my mother? For, remember, Were all her fancies multiplied by ten, She is my mother still; nor do her waysâ Strange though they be, and open to rebukeâ Sever the bond between us. Gold. Madge, I swear, A fortnight hence she'll thank us for her cure, And vow the bitter medicine was sweet Wherewith we drugged her. Have you faith in me? Madge. Some little, Hal. But work your own designs; Bring me as seldom in them as you can; I will not thwart you. Gold. And your secret, now? Madge. Am I of age to marry? Gold. You? poh! poh! A very child. Madge. And so my mother thinks. Gold. Why, then I'll swearâfor she ne'er thought arightâ You 're old enought to be Methuselah's wife, On his last birth-day! How old are you, Madge? Madge. Twenty. Gold. A fib! Madge. Too true! [Sighs.] Gold. 'Sdeath, and you sigh! What 's twenty? Madge. 'T is twice ten; but double that. I have lived twenty years a lonely maid; I might live twenty more; or die between, Like a good purpose that neglects its time, And dies for want of action. Tell me, Hal, How do you like Sir William Travers? Gold. Well: A noble fellow; all that 's good in man Finds lodging with him. Madge. Lodges there, and sleeps? Gold. No, no; enacts a royal part, and fills Its fair abode with splendor. Madge. Say you so? Gold. Of course; who could say less? Madge. I'm glad of it. Gold. And why? Madge. He has proposed to me.â Gold. He! he! The man 's a foolâa stark, rank, raving fool! Madge. Thank you, sweet sir! You 're pleased to flatter me. A fool to wed me! Gold. Yes, a very fool: There is a spice of folly in us all. You are not suited for each other.âNo; Neither in rank, tastes, fortune, friends, nor aught That makes a marriage proper. What, good goose, Would you wed him? Madge. I thought of it. Gold. O, pah! He is too wise for youâand knows it well; He is most absolute and settled down In his opinion of his intellect. Why, Madge, he holds such mortals as ourselves As little better than born naturals;â Things to be driven, here and there, at will, Like shuttlecocks. Madge. Then he 's too good for me?â More flattery! Gold. Zounds! no; he 's not too goodâ Who is?âbut thenâbut thenâdamn it!â Madge. You swore! Gold. Now, Madge, I tell youâyou are not quite madâ If you intend to wed, choose some mere man, A fellow like myself, perhaps; and love himâ Love him with your whole heartâbecause he needs it. Don't take an intellect, a thought-machine, To look up to, and worship. Zounds! I'm mad; And you 're both fools! [Walks about passionately.] Madge. Dear Harry, so I would; I like your counsel, you are very wise; But no mere man, like you, affords the chance. I 'd love a man, like you, with all my heart, If one, like you, like you would counsel me; And teach, like you, this poor heart to confess How it could love a man, like you, indeed. Ah, me! [Weeps.] Gold. What is the matter, Madgeâsweet Madge? [Takes her hand.] Look up; you shall not wed this Travers, dear: No one shall force you, dearest, dearest Madge;â [Embraces her.] By heaven, they shall not! my adored one, myâ [Sinks on his knee.] By all the saints, I do believe I love her! Madge. Ha! ha! ha! [Laughing.] Gold. Out, you witch! [Starts up.] Madge. You really love me? Gold. Yes; the thing is out; I'll put the best face That I can upon it. Madge. No; you half hate me. Gold. And if I doâ Madge. No oaths. You love me too Nearly enough to take compassion on me, And marry me yourself? Gold. Indeed, I do. Madge. Yet you were rather late to find it out. Gold. True, true: but 't was a thing forever mine; So much a part of me, I never thought Upon it, as we do on outward things: As one may have a leg, an arm, an eye, And use it daily, without daily saying, This is my leg, or arm, or eye; and this Is its true function, and just so it works. Madge. Too plain to see, too present to fear loss, Till loss was threatened: I can understand. But, Halâ Gold. Dear Madge. Madge. You spoke? Gold. No; you. Madge. Well, thenâ Gold. Why, trueâ [Embraces, and is about to kiss her, as Darkly enters.] Darkly. (Groaning.) O! O!â Gold. 'Ods blood! Ha! Darkly, ha! [Laughing.] My cousin, sirâI say my cousin, sirâ My aunt's true daughterâby some accident, Got something in her eye. Dark. I do perceive The maid hath something in her eye, forsooth, Even at this distance. And perchance her eyesâ Being thy cousin'sâdo lie round about, Even in the girdle that confines her garb. Gold. (Jerking away his hand.) Ha! ha! my hand?âO, yesâI put it thereâ Only to steady her. Dark. Ah, me! I 've heard The sufferer this wise must be steadiÃ©d. Hast thou removed the mote? O, neighbor Goldstraw, First cast the beam out of thine own! A beam Tempting to damsels, called by the profane Men of Charles Stuart, the love-lightâwoe is me! Gold. You sanctimonious sharper, blab one word, And I will flay you! Dark. Ah! the wrath of love! Some mouths are closed with promises, and some Are sealed with gold, and other someâ [Goldstraw puts a purse into his hand.] Gold. Ha! shut? What have you seen? Dark. Naught. Gold. Liar! did you not See Harry Goldstraw kiss his cousin's cheek? Dark. Nay, verily. Gold. False slave, what know you, then? Dark. Naught that concerns them. Gold. Well said! Madge, I play Lord Ruffler's part, his master. Mark me now; I'll put him to the most extreme ordeal. Patch-text, you canter, youâyou hobbling knave, There 's something in you, and I'll rip it out! Speak, or I'll murder you! Dark. And shall I speak The things that are of false Beelzebub? Coin cunning lies, to please thee? O, alas! Gold. Talk, you psalm-singing villainâtalk, I sayâ Or you and life shall not get off together! [Beats him.] Dark. O! O! my death draws on. Deliverance Is opening to the martyr! O! O! O! Gold. I am quite blown. My faith is strengthened, brother, By thy endurance. For each day you keep My secret, I will give you half a pound; If you betray me, a whole pounding waits, To which this was but shadow. Dark. Verily Man cannot serve two masters. If I take Thy golden lucre, I am bound to thee, Even at thy chariot-wheel. Gold. Enough, begone! Dark. Master and damsel, peace be with you both! [Exit.] Madge. Will he betray us? Gold. While the money lasts, No fear. A soul more sordid never skulked in man. Madge. Hark, some one comes. Your friends. Gold. Fly, love! But, Madge, Think of the plot. And, Madgeâ Madge. Quick, hurry, then. Gold. Remember me. Madge. I feared you meant to kiss me. Gold. Well feared! [Attempts to kiss her, she slips past him.] Madge. Well gone! [Exit.] (Enter Ruffler and Travers.) Ruffler. See little Madge there, see! She 's always dogging me. Travers. Poor dog! Ruf. 'Sdeath! Hal, Your aunt is all one glow. It puzzles me To keep her in the bounds of prudence. I Should be your uncle, without aid of priest, If I allowed her ardor to have way. The waiting-maid, who boxed my ears for yours, Is gentler grown to-day, I warrant you. I must say nothing; but you'll see, you'll see.â Lord! what a pliant thing a woman is! Gold. Poor Doll! You have not wronged her? Ruf. âWronged her!â phew! I pleased her well enough. Say nothing, Hal: You'll cross my suit else. Here my widow comes. Stand by, and see me woo her. Gold. (Apart to Travers.) O! that man! He has more antics than a tutored ape. [Exit with Travers.] (Enter Lady Goldstraw.) Ruf. My life! Lady Goldstraw. Heigh ho! Ruf. Star of my destiny, Where have you hidden, while my moments ran To dross and blackness? I have heavy news; Doleful to you, perchance, and to poor me Darker than cloudy midnight. Lady G. Marry, now! Cheer up, my lord! hold up your lordly head! Let me, my lord, like a bright star, essay To struggle through your lordship's gloomy dumps. Ruf. She stole that speech from Hopeful. (Aside.) Woe is me! Ruin, destruction, horror, blood, and death, Stare in my face, and beckon me away! Yet you, you, author of my joy and grief, Lull me to rest with dulcet melody! Lady G. The Lord 'a mercy! noble gentleman, What irks your lordship, then? Ruf. My father, lady, The proud and cruel Earl of fifty towns, Some villages, and miles of fruitful land, Hearing his heir in thy sweet thraldom lived, Sends here a messenger of trusty faith,â John Rook, his butler,âwith this dread command: âEither give up your courtship of the fair And much-respected Lady Goldstraw, son, Or wed her instantly, upon the pain Of my displeasure.â Now, I knowing well Thy crueltyâfor all beauties must be cruelâ Droop in my spirits, and prepare to die. Lady G. Poor soul! and will you die outright, indeed? I am no crueller than the rest, my lord. Ruf. You find me choosing out my means of death. Whether to throw me from some rocky height Into a den of wolves; or watch my chance For sharks and porpoises, to boldly plunge Into their hungry maws; or by some drug; Or by the ignominious cord; or, Snatching at once the nearest means of death, With this fell rapierâ [Offers to stab himself.] Lady G. O! O! help, help, help! Think of the carpetâI will marry youâ My best new Turkey-carpet! Ruf. Angel, speak! Has Turkey's loom embroidered life for me? And wilt thou wed me? Lady G. Spare my modesty. Ruf. But when? Lady G. O, la! Ruf. Now, lady; or the stars Shall sayâwe rose upon his bloody corpse! [He coughs.] (Enter Darkly.) Here is my chaplain,âa grim, worthy man, Of dismal piety, and awful hopes. Darkly. O! O! Ruf. To him let us confide ourselves. Then I in triumph, with the morrow's sun, Will bear thee to my father's gorgeous halls; Saying, âGreat Earl, behold my beauteous bride!â Lady G. How prettily you talk, my lord! So you One day will be an earl, and Iâ Ruf. A countess! To show how small a thing a title is, Laid on thy natural majesty. (Enter Travers, Goldstraw, and Madge.) Behold, My plighted bride! (Presenting Lady Goldstraw.) Madge. What, motherâ Lady G. Silence, child! Goldstraw. You will not, auntâ Lady G. Will not! and why? Madge. O, shame! Lady G. Hush, or I'll wring your ears! (Apart to Madge.) Gold. Pray hear me, madam. Lady G. Send welcome words, or none. Travers. And you, my lord, Heir to an earldom, run your noble blood Into a puddle! Ruf. Puddle her again, And at the word you die! Gold. It shall not be: O, aunt!â Madge. O, mother! [They lay hold on Lady Goldstraw.] Trav. Base, degenerate lord, By Jove, you shall not! [Seizes Ruffler.] Ruf. And by Mars, I will! Dark. O! the blasphemers! [Groans.] Ruf. (Breaking from Travers.) What, am I betrayedâ Made over like a pawnâmy love enslaved! Come forth, my faithful steel, and show the world How freedom brightens in thy awful glare! [Draws.] Scum of the earth; release my love and me, Or I will pave a highway with your hearts, Though you were giants leagued with amazons! Off, Travers!âFollow, Darkly!âStand aside! My sword shall be my groomsman, and grim death My only guest and witness; dying groans Shall be my marriage-bells, and thou my bride! [Seizes Lady Goldstraw, and exit with her, followed by Darkly.] ACT IV. SCENE I. A Boudoir in Lady Goldstraw's House. Enter Lady Goldstraw. Lady Goldstraw. I don't half like it: money, money, moneyâ Nothing but money; and the ink scarce dry Upon our marriage-contract. How is this? But Lady RufflerâI am Lady Rufflerâ Heir to an earldom, a peer's wife, in sooth. âHow does your ladyship?â a duchess cries: âAh! poorly, thank your grace,â I say; and then Her loose-tongued highness has familiar jokes About the ills of a new-wedded pair: Says, âRuffler should be pleased;â and pinches meâ Yes, faith, I feel her grace's fingers pinchâ The gay, bold, wicked duchess! Ah! dear me! That covers much. And then my husband's loveâ The brave, young, handsome fellow! Poor, poor soul, He loves me dearly; and that covers more. What are a thousand pounds or so? (Enter Nick.) Nick. Your grace, Your most imperious ladyshipâ Lady G. Fie! Nick, You over-rank me, fie! Call me plain Ladyâ Plain Lady Ruffler. Nick. Well, plain Lady Rufflerâ Lady G. Presuming knave! such words to rank like mine! Have you no proper reverence, impudent! For aristocracy, and birth, and titled names? Have we not been the pillars of this land? What would you do without us? Nick. I don't know. We do all your work now, and I suppose, Mayhap, we 'd do our own then. What would you, Your royal highness, do without us, hey? Who 'd dig for you, who 'd wait, who 'd till your land?â Who 'd fight your battles, die in flocks for you, And give you all the praise, and gold, and rank, And stars and garters, and that sort of thing, While we starve on forgotten? Please your grace, I heard an old mechanic say all that, Over a pot of porter. Lady G. How now, Nick? What, will you murmur? Nick. No; you see I don't. When we begin to murmur, then look out For thrones, and crowns, and things! Your gouty lords Will feel the people's broad, rough, hob-nailed shoes Upon their toes. Lady G. Dear, dear! Nick Prior, I vow, If you frequent that odious porter-house, I'll turn you out of doors. Nick. Why, true enough, A man might learn in better places, mam; But we will learn it somewhere. Lady G. What brought you here? Nick. A flock of woodcocks. O, your ladyship, There is a crowd of fellows at the door, With bills as long as Lent, to see my lord.â There is more aristocracy for you! They make a noise too, and the people stop. Lady G. Admit them, then. (Exit Nick.) I sent that Nick to school For no good purpose. So, more bills to pay, More money to be sunk! Has my lord nothing? (Enter three Tradesmen.) All the Tradesmen. Please your ladyshipâ Lady G. Well, well! First Tradesman. Hush, I'll speak. Please, mam, the others sent us up, to see If we can get some money on our bills. Here they are, mam. (Throws down a huge bundle of bills.) Pay all alike, or none: That 's our agreement. Lady G. Give me time to look. First T. For certain, madam; but we hope you'll take A shorter time to look than we have had: For, please you, madamâ Lady G. You have said enough. [Exeunt Tradesmen.] âFor furnishing Miss Polly Trifle's house, [Reading.] Five hundred pounds! Ditto for furnishing Miss Flaunt's apartments, seven hundred pounds!â Dear me! and all within six monthsâthe monster! [Takes up another bill.] âOne brocade tissue silk, for Missââ (Enter Ruffler, beating in a Servant.) Ruffler. Hey! slave, You'll open doors, you will, and flood my house With such another deluge of old bills, To vex my lady, hey! Servant. Indeed, my lordâ Ruf. Indeed your lord! and being such, I'll trounce you! [Beats him. Servant cries.] Silence your bellowing, calf! Do you not see Your clamor grieves my lady? Stupid dolt! She cannot bear to hear a human cry. Ser. Then spare your blows. Ruf. 'T is not my blows disturb her, But your most hideous yells. (Beats him.) Peace, slave! Lady G. My lordâ O, dear!âmy lord! Ruf. What say you, sweet? Lady G. Forbear; 'T was not his fault; Nick Prior let them in. Ruf. Hah! call Nick Prior. (To Servant.) I'll make him twice a man: I'll double all his bones, by breaking them. Lady G. Pray, pray, forgive him! I adopted Nick, Sent him to school, and made a fool of him: Besides, I ordered him to bring them up. My lord, 't would break my heart. Ruf. Enough, my love. Go, sirrah! you are innocent, it seems. Receive those blows but as a specimen Of what I can do, when my hand is in, Not a genuine flogging. (Exit Servant.) Well, my witch, It seems you called these trading devils up; I pray you, lay them. Lady G. What 's the gross amount? Ruf. Some thousandsâtenâor twelveâor so. Lady G. Lord, Lord! I cannot pay it; it would ruin me: Let them take half. Ruf. And half dishonor me! Is this affection? Is this woman's love? Or have I married with a huckster? Lady G. La! Well, call them in. But, O! my lord, the way, The naughty way, in which you made these bills! Ruf. Naughty! my charities. Lady G. Five hundred pounds, To stock a lady's house, for charity! Ruf. 'Sdeath! yes: she 'd nothing to her back, poor thing, When first I met her. Lady G. Like enough. My lord, I'll pay this once;âbut no more charities. Ruf. Ho, there! (ReÃ«nter Tradesmen.) Lady G. (Writing.) Here is an order on my banker.â My money in the funds must melt for this. [Aside.] Make it go far. [Gives a paper.] Second Tradesman. (To Ruffler.) I'll send the velvet gowns. Lady G. What did you say? Second T. My lord bespoke some gowns. Lady G. For whom? Second T. A lady. Lady G. Doubtless! When? Second T. To-day. Lady G. More charities! Ruf. Ay, faith! she 's hardly clothed; There 's scarce a rag between her and the wind. Lady G. And so you get her velvet gowns, 'ods love!â And on my wedding-day! Ruf. Tailor, look here. Make me a pair of breeches. Second T. Yes, my lord. [Goes to measure him.] Ruf. Ass, take that! (Cuffs him.) They are not for me. Second T. For whom? Ruf. My lady, to be sure: and here 's the price. [Throws a purse at him.] She shall have breeches, if I have no gowns. 'Ods blood! she needs them. Can one ride the horse She 's mounted on to-day, with decency, In woman's gear? Lady G. O heaven!âO patience, heaven! [Aside.] Ruf. One moment, gentle lady. Look you, tailor: [To Second Tradesman.] I want a taffeta body-cloth and hood, Picked here and there with gold embroidery, For Jennet, my gray mare. Upholsterer, [To Third Tradesman.] Provide me with a bed of eider down, Roomy and thick, and of the choicest feather, For Juno, my sick spaniel. Ay, and, tailor, Make me six court-suits. See the stuff be rich. Goldsmith, you'll match some jewels to the clothes; [To First Tradesman.] A casket for each suit. Andânay, you may go: I have a thousand wants; but these are chief. Ah! goldsmith, I forgot the rapiers; A rapier for each suit; and in the hilt Of each Toledo see you place a gem, For which a gentleman may not be shamed. And, tailorâ Lady G. Nay, my lord, I'll have a robeâ Ruf. A robe, the devil! Will you ruin me? How shall I have my horse-clothes and my bed, My jewels and my rapiers, and such things, If I indulge your monstrous luxury? Shame, shame! be modest. Lady G. Pray, whose money buys Your trumpery, good sir? Ruf. Ours, to be sure. Lady G. âOurs!â my fine lord: are you beside yourself? Am I to go worse covered than your horse? Get me a taffeta body-cloth and hood, To match your Jennet's; stand me in her stall; Or let me lie beside your ailing dog. 'Ods mercy! if I must be ruined thus, I claim a share, above your jade or cur, In the destruction of my own estate! Ruf. La! now, my dear, sweet, gentle, loving wife, Did I not know you far too well, I'd say That you are really in a passion, chuck! [Pats her cheek] Lady G. Keep off your hands! Ruf. Why, then, hang out a sign, Like those we see upon the new-made doors, âBeware the paint!â Lady G. Savage! insult your wife Before the faces of these vulgar knaves! Ruf. Insult you, love! because I would preserve The painful labor of your dressing-maid? Am I a tasteless Vandal or a Hun, To mar so delicate a work of art? 'Ods death! you wrong me grievously, sweet wife. Lady G. Why are you waiting, tradesmen? You are paid. [Exeunt First and Third Tradesmen.] And you, sir goose? [To Second Tradesman.] Second T. To take your measure, madam. Lady G. Ay, for the robe. Ruf. No; for the breeches, wife. Lady G. Out of my house, insulting cur! Ruf. What, love, Has he insulted you? Outrageous patch, Here in her husband's presence! By the gods, I'll make your bones ache for your sinful tongue! Will you not stir? So then, take that, and that! [Exit, beating him out.] Lady G. O! what a temper, what a tongue, what arms, And what incessant use he makes of them! Ha, marry! and the breeches, my fair lord; I'll make you wish you never offered them. I'll close your wasteful courses too, sweet sir; Even if I put my whole estate in trust.â (Enter Goldstraw and Madge, sorrowfully.) Well, what 's the matter? Madge. My new father, mother! Goldstraw. And my new uncle, aunt! Lady G. But how is this? Are these sad eyes the welcome that you give? Gold. Ah! aunt, your bride-bells should have tolled a knell; Your friends, in crape, should have walked, two by two, Behind the hearse that drew you to the church; The priest, in black, have read the burial-rites; And when 't was over, better far for you If you had leaped into your grave alive! Lady G. To spoil your fancies, I was wed at home. Poh, poh! you prate. Gold. Dear madam, have you heard?â Lady G. Of what? Gold. Of Ruffler? Lady G. Give his title, sir. Gold. Ay, when he gets it. Lady G. When he gets it! Gold. Yes, Along with his estate. Lady G. You called him rich. But that is nothing,âI 've enough for both. Gold. If he could cheat you, how might I escape? Lady G. Where are his father's lands? Gold. In chancery: And his petition for the earldom, too, Is laid upon the table of the Lords, Session by session, with a general laugh. Lady G. A swindler, eh? Gold. Worse, madam, worse, I fear: A noted rake, a ruined gamester, auntâ A common drunkard, a notorious cheatâ A murderous bully, thrice tried for his life, But thrice he dodged the gallows. Lady G. Mercy! mercy! I can't believe it. Gold. Heaven avert the time, When you may be compelled! Lady G. (Taking his arm.) Your arm, I pray. HarryâO dear!âyou see I 'm calm enough. I do not tremble, do I? Has my cheek Lost its accustomed color? Look, boy, look! I bear me as a lady.âSaints above, I shall go raving mad! [Exit with Goldstraw.] Madge. I cannot laugh; Yet I suppose I should. This may be wit; Yet, to my poor dull brain, it seems like cruelty. Hal has my word to keep the secret too: Would I had pledged it to that Travers!â (Enter Travers.) Travers. (Aside.) Ha! My name upon her lips! Fair Madge, you 're caught, Caught in the very act. Madge. Of what, sir? Trav. Tut! I heard my name. Madge. I grant: so may a rogue, When he is called in court. Trav. How, angry, Madge? Madge. O! no, sir; pleased, pleased with your pretty tricksâ Pleased with your gambolsâwith the holiday You three stout gentlemen have given yourselves Over a poor old lady! Trav. Say the word, And I will end it. Madge. No; 't is well perhaps, Just punishment perhaps, if men have right To take heaven's functions, and rebuff our sins; Or seize the church's office, and patch up Our moral rentsâmere patchwork, though, for all. Harry persuaded me; he may be right.â I would I were a hundred leagues away! I'll hide myself; for since our house became A moral hospital, sin seems so rankâ In doctors, nurses, patients, and spectatorsâ That I could wish a plague were on us all, To spot our skins, and let our hearts alone. Trav. 'T is but a comedy. Madge. So you design; But Heaven knows how 't will end. Man's comedies Do often end in sobs, and tears, and blood. [He takes her hand.] Let go my hand, sir! Till your play be o'er, The best among this feigning company Shall not receive it. [Exit.] Trav. She is worth a crown! Would I could really lover her! But this loveâ Pshaw! 't is a mere infirmity, a toy Of painted candy, that tastes well enough Until we swallow it; but, then, there is No rest until we cast it up again. Yet for all that, sweet Madge, I'll marry you. Ah me! I wish I really were in love! [Exit.] SCENE II. An Ante-Room in the Same. Servants cross the stage, carrying dishes, wine, &amp;c. Enter Darkly and Dolly Flare. Darkly. Lo! where the servants of iniquity Bear carnal meats in to the revellers! Dolly. But, Mr. Darkly, hear me. I believe You meant no harm to a poor orphan girl, Yet, O! you 've done one, sir. Dark. Avoid thee, woman! Why dost thou still pursue me with thy tongue, And break upon my meditations thus? I tell thee, as a servant of the truth, I know not what thou mean'st. Dol. Then listen, sir. You know the time you sought me, to exhort And drive the tempter from me?â Dark. Truly, maid: And it befell that, waxing strong in faith, I was caught up in spirit, and abode Above an hour entrancÃ©d. Dol. And I, too, I was caught up in spirit. Dark. Happy soul! And when I woke, I found thee standing by, Weeping and wailing at what thou didst call Thy âloss of honor;â and it so befell, The night being dark, thy honor being but small We could not find it. Although I arose, And lit a taper, and did search the room, Even from the centre to the ends thereof. Dol. It is not possible you do not know My meaning, Mr. Darkly! Dark. As a lamb, So am I innocent of thy intent. Unless, perchance, thy so-called honor be A bead, a trinket, or such vanity, As maids delight in. Dol. Were you quite entranced? Do you remember nothing? Dark. I was rapt Above this sublunary sphere; the world Fell from me like a garment; yea, the flesh Was melted in the spirit, as a vessel Cast in amid the burning. Dol. Then I'll speak Right up and down.â Dark. Speak, but beware the wrath! If thou dost stain my hearing with such talk As enters in the organs of the vile, Lo! I will curse thee with a cleaving curse! I'll plunge thee quick into the fiery pit, Where roaring devils broil, and hiss, and stew On brimstone embers of eternal woe!â Where groaning Satan stamps his cloven foot, Lashes his barbÃ©d tail, and howls their sins Into the splitting earsâ Dol. (Stopping her ears.) O stop, sir, stop! Indeed, I'll hold my tongueâindeed, I will. Dark. Thou hast been biding with unholy men. That man of stripes, that pagan, who afflicts The humble servant, hath deluded theeâ Yea, even Ruffler, whom men hail a lord. Therefore, I say to thee, depart with him; Dwell in his tent; and make thy habitation Among his handmaids. For, of verity, That which man breaketh, let him also mend. Go, I have laid commandment on thee, go! And if he scorn thee, hie unto his wife, And lay thy sorrows down before her feet: So when she gives thee gold and silver coin, Make thou return to me; and I will counsel What pious use thy money may go to. Dol. Is that your best advice? Dark. Yea, verily. (Enter a Servant, with a dish.) Young serving-man, tarry a little while. What dost thou bear? (Opens the dish.) Strong meats. Ah me! ah me! A beggar waiteth close beside the porch; His need is greater than thy lord's. Go, thou, And stand behind thy master, where he sits; But make no mention of this silly dish. [Takes the dish.] And if he asks thee, answer, âBy the way I slipped and stumbled.â For I say to thee, Much evil must be done, that good may come [Trips up the Servant.] Damsel, I will endure thy company. [Exit with Dolly.] Servant. (Rising.) Well, that must be a very pious man! [Exit.] SCENE III. A Banqueting-Room in the Same. A table spread for a feast, at which are seated Ruffler, Travers, Goldstraw, Pollen, Foam, Hopeful, Marks, Lady Goldstraw, Madge, and other Ladies and Gentlemen. Servants in waiting. Travers. (Apart to Ruffler.) Go to it boldly, Ruffler. All these fellows Have been instructed in their parts, and all Have sworn to aid you; some inspired by fun, And some by malice or revenge. Ruffler. But, Will, You did not trust them with my plot? Trav. O no; Their natural wickedness was spur enough. They volunteered a thousand graceless things More than I asked. Begin. Ruf. Sirrah, the woodcock! First Servant. Please you, my lord, I stumbled. Ruf. Stumbled, ha!â Take that! [Throws a bottle at him.] Lady Goldstraw. My lord is merry. [To the company.] First S. O, my head! Ruf. Poor soul, he 's hurt! I'll heal you, Come, kneel down. [Servant kneels.] Travers, that sauce. Let me anoint his wound. [Pours sauce over servant.] First S. O Lord! I 'm scalded! Ruf. Scalded! Quick, some wineâ 'Ods blood! some wine! He'll die upon my hands. [Gives a bottle of wine.] Drink all, my boy; down with it, every drop; Or I'll not answer for you. [Servant drinks.] Lady G. Joyous heart! The very life of company. O dear! The man is surely mad. (Aside.) Ha, ha! my lord, [Laughing.] You have a humor of your own. Ruf. How, wife, Do I enact the good Samaritan, To have you call it humor? Now, 'ods life! I feel a virtuous anger at your scorn. Madge. I cannot bear this; it will break my heart! [Aside. Exit.] Lady G. I meant no scorn. Ruf. 'Sdeath! do you answer me? Lady G. I 'm dumb, my lord. Ruf. This Burgundy is sour: Who brought it in? Second and Third Servants. We did, my lord. Ruf. Then drink it. [Lady Goldstraw shakes her head at them.] What, you refuse when I command? [Starts up.] Servants. No, no! We'll drink it. [They drink.] Ruf. All! Lady R. You'll make them drunk, my lord. Ruf. The better, love; they will not see your state. Lady G. My state! Ruf. Ay, madam, your unseemly state. It grieves me to call notice to a sight Which all here have observed, too plainly, madam. Pray, ladies, lead her to her room, and use Your dearest care about her. [The Ladies rise.] Lady G. (Starting up.) Marry! queans, Touch me, and I'll be even with your eyes! You base, ungrateful ruffian, thus to lieâ Ay, never winceâto lie, to lie, to lieâ Over and over in your teethâto lie About a lady! The Lord Mayor, my husbandâ Ruf. Hang the Lord Mayor, your husband! Never cast His old dry bones into my face again! The devil has him. Lady G. And his widow too, I fear. O gentlemen, if you be such, How can your manhood brook, unmoved, This villain's insults? Goldstraw. He 's my uncle, aunt. Trav. Your husband, madam. Pollen. Captain of your squad. Foam. La! yes. Marks. And guardian of your property. Hopeful. (Drunk.) Ex-queen of my affectionâ Lady G. Silence, cowards! I will not learn my duty from your lips, Pale-hearted cravens!â Servants. (Drunk. Sing.) The devil 's a gentleman, I contendâ Tra, ra, la, la! the bottle standsâ His horn 's his beginning, his tail 's his end, And hisâ Lady G. Dare ye, dare ye, knaves, Sing filthy rhymes before your mistress' face? Out of the houseâout, every one of you! Ruf. Budge, and I'll skin you! Hope. (Drunk.) Scorn not poesyâhic! Ruf. Well said, my poet! Come, a song, a song! We'll tame her temper with our harmony. (Sings, passing the bottle.) Drag it round the table's bound, By the glassy muzzle. He who goes in ragged clothes Has a mouth to guzzle. All. [Chorus.] For Rhenish wine is fit for swine, So is wine of Landes; But the bowl to reach the soul Is immortal brandy! Ruf. [Sings.] Drink it down without a frown; When we cannot tap it, When the cup we can't get up, We'll duck our heads and lap it. All. [Chorus.] For Rhenish wine is fit for swine, So is wine of Landes; But the bowl to reach the soul Is immortal brandy! Ruf. How like you that? Lady G. Come, ladies, if there 's left One grain of self-respect among you all, And leave these drunkards. Husband, ribald, brute! Tear up my rooms, break all my furniture, Murder my servants, set the house afireâ Do all the devilish pranks your drunken brain Can stumble over; but, in Heaven's good name, Drink yourself dead! Never come out of thisâ This beastly cloud of shame and infamyâ To torture me with your gross, odious life! Die, gorged with your own basenessâdie, and rot! And I will bury you, and kiss your body, Which, living, I abhor! [Exit with Ladies.] Ruf. Indeed! Ho, ho! [Laughing.] All. [Laughing, sing.] For Rhenish wine is fit for swine, So is wine of Landes; But the bowl to reach the soul Is immortal brandy! [The curtain falls, amid roars of drunken laughter.] ACT V. SCENE I. A Room in Lady Goldstraw's house. Enter Lady Goldstraw, sadly. Lady Goldstraw. O sorrow, sorrow! Was there e'er a fool Before my timeâan old, blind, doting fool? Off, painted faceâoff, curlsâoff, all that 's false! [Rubbing her face, and tearing off her false hair.] Henceforth I'll make my age my guardian: He may respect a thing that 's reverend, Even in me, who merit no respect. Ah! silly vanity of womankind, What an example may you see in me! Who fought with nature, struggling to put off The gentle touches of her slow decay, Until she turned upon me, in her wrath, And gave me all my wishes. A young lord Who tears my peaceful mansion inside out; Squanders my well-stored wealth on revellers, Dogs, horses, wantons; and rewards my grief With scorn, and mockery, and tempestuous rage That aims too plainly at my hapless life; But, missing that, torments me with cruel wounds, Bleeding from all but mortal parts. Ah me! Would I were in my grave! But, gentle Madge, Left to the care of this wild dissolute, What were thy portion? There I am pulled back, And bound to life again. My child, my child! This heart awakens from a long, long trance; And throws itself upon thee with a love That will not be cast off except in death! [Weeps.] (Enter Ruffler, Travers, and Goldstraw.) Ruffler. What, in the water, drowning in your tears! How 's this, old girl? Why, what an ancient look You have to-day! Where has your color gone, Your curls and gewgaws? Now, for all the world, You seem like some old ruin that has stood A thousand years, then tumbled all at once. Lady G. Scoff! I deserve it. Travers. (Apart to Ruffler and Goldstraw.) Ha! the physic works. Ruf. Travers, what 's that? (Pointing to the false hair upon the floor.) Has the wool come to life Within the carpet?âDoes it grow in curls? [Turning it over with his sword.] Lady G. That is my hair.â Ruf. No! by the Lord, 't is mine: It grows upon my carpet. Lady G. Jesting still! The bloom you saw upon my withered cheeks Was paint, the curls around my sunken brow Were false, and there they lie, never to rise. When I have dressed my age in proper guise, You'll see more changes yet: A poor, old woman! I shall be sixty-three the fourth of March. Goldstraw. Her age, by Jove! [Apart to Ruffler and Travers.] Ruf. A woman tell her age! Here 's a good symptom, Travers. Now tell me I cannot manage women! [Apart to him.] Trav. So I do: You are malignant to a lady's maid, But harmless to her mistress. Ruf. Envy, envy! There 's Madge.âBut, pshaw! I'll not waste words on you. (Enter Dolly Flare, weeping.) Dolly. O, mistress, mistress!â Lady G. Well, what is it, child? Dol. O, mam, your husband!â Lady G. There he stands, my girl: He'll answer you. Dol. He cannot; he 's afraid To look his victim in the face. Lady G. What, what? Do I hear rightly? How is this, my lord? Ruf. 'Sdeath! mind your private ways, mend your own sins, And leave me to myself! What right have you To interfere with me? Lady G. The right I claim Is delegated from a higher power Than earth affordsâthe right of every one Who lifts a voice to aid the sufferer. Ruf. Fine talk, fine talk! Lady G. You turn aside, my lord. Ruf. To laugh. Lady G. You dare not look her in the eyes! Ruf. Here, Doll, come here, and let me stare at you. [Takes her by the shoulders.] By heaven! I think she'll blush into a blaze, If I look longer. Dare not look at her! 'Ods blood! I dare do more, before you, too; [Kisses Dolly.] And yet I never wronged her. Dol. Don't believe him! Ruf. Presuming hussy, do you say to meâ To me, remember, who can fathom youâ That I betrayed you? Dol. Yes, I do, indeed. Ruf. Lord love the women, they are worse than men! Trav. Why, Guy, you have confessed it! Gold. Yes, to us; Ay, boasted of it. Ruf. Have you no regard For a man's feelings? 'Sblood! there stands my wife. You treacherous villains, do you counterplot? Carry the war to Africa? [Apart to Travers and Goldstraw.] Lady G. A shame Upon your falsehood! Ruf. (To Dolly.) Baggage, leave the house! You plot against me, you connive with rogues. Lady G. Come with me, Dolly; I cannot do much, But what I can I will. This last is worst: I feared and hated the bold debauchee, But now I brave you, and despise you, sir! [Exit with Dolly.] Ruf. You rascals! Trav. Why? Gold. We only spoke the truth. Ruf. Well, well; but out of time. There 's Madge, too, Madgeâ Another female trouble in my path. Trav. As how? Ruf. The old complaintâlove, love. Trav. (Laughing.) Ha! ha! I'll take her off your hands. Ruf. Take her, indeed! What, you cold, bloodless lizard, take my Madgeâ You who can rail at love a June-day through! You icy reptile, if you had my blossomâ My delicate young bud, my fragrant Madgeâ What would you do with her? Press her to death Between the pages of some monstrous book, As girls do flowers? Parch her with learning? Or, With a vile course of your experiments, To reach the mysteries of the human heart, Pull her poor nature all to pieces, ha, As country-maids do, leaf by leaf, The flower they try their simple fortunes on? What are you laughing at? Trav. At you. Gold. (Laughing.) Ha! ha! Ruf. And you? Gold. At both of you. Ruf. A merry set. But here comes Madge. Observe her, how she haunts me: Yet I can't help it. Do you blame me, sirs? If girls will fall in love, all I can do Is to endure with my best modesty. Trav. Of course, of course! [Laughing.] Gold. (Aside.) Which is the greater fool, Mere vanity or conscious excellence? Here are two coxcombs, by two different ways, Both meeting at one point, and both astray. Ruf. Withdraw, withdraw! I wish to treat myself To a small dish of feminine affection. Gold. Heaven speed you, king of hearts! Trav. We take our leave Of your imperial highness; yet our leave leaves you In most amusing companyâwith yourself. [Exit with Goldstraw, laughing.] (Enter Madge.) Madge. Father. Ruf. My child. Nay, fear me not, approach. What would you, daughter? Madge. A strange suit, good sir: Divorce my mother. Ruf. If you'll take her place. Madge. How can I answer till your hand be free? Ruf. I bear my wife, your mother, no more love Than a physician bears some desperate case Given to his hands, who sees but the disease, Not the poor wretch who suffers; upon that I spend my skill. Madge. But now the patient mends. You 've brought her to plain clothes, and simple talk, Clean cheeks, true hair, and modest carriage. I pray you, give her to my nursing hands, And let me do my part. Ruf. She may relapse. (Enter, behind, Lady Goldstraw.) Madge. I will go bail for that. Ruf. Offer your bail. Madge. My lips. Ruf. I take the bail. [Offers to kiss her.] Madge. Nay, father, father, You push paternal privilege too far. Ruf. Unnatural child, my heart weeps blood for you! Give me the bail, and in another hour She shall be free: if notâ Madge. Well, if a kissâ A formal, legal kissâcan set her free; Here, take it. [Offers her cheek.] Ruf. Now, don't flinch. [As he goes to kiss her, Lady Goldstraw comes between, and he kisses her.] Ugh! Heaven be praised, I took you for the devil! Lady Goldstraw. Your close friend, And therefore kissed me. Madge, my love, come, come. Madge. But, madamâ Ruf. Ay, keep faith; the bail 's unpaid. Madge. Can I not kiss my fatherâonly once? Lady G. Not if that kiss unclosed the doors of heaven, And all the world could troop in after you. O, villain, villain! [Apart to Ruffler.] Ruf. Will you not agree? Lady G. âAgree!â you bold, base monster, who would stain The only pure thing that is left to me!â âAgree!ââI could say thatâbut, no, not now; Not in the hearing of my child, whose ears Would be polluted by the faintest hint Of your most virtuous thought. Begone, begone! Out of the world! you sully human sin By fouler projects than belong to earth. Away! you are prepared in quality For the most darksome corner of the pit. Away! the gates will gape to let you through. [Exit with Madge.] Ruf. What an infernal blast she blew at me! I feel quite singed by her sulphureous breath; And all because my daughter wants a kiss. (Enter Travers, sorrowfully.) Why, Will, what saddens you? Travers. The saddest news; Matter to make your inky locks turn gray. Ah! Ruffler, when you planned this merry jest, I little thought, my friend, that you would be Its chiefest victim. Ruf. Do not rack me, Will: Speak out. Trav. Well, DarklyâHeaven preserve you Guy!â Ruf. Will Travers, by the blessed sun above, I'll tear you into tatters, limb by limb, If you torment me! Trav. Then, dear Guy, poor Guy, Darkly has told to me, in confidence, That he has taken orders as a priest, And you are married, absolutely, Guy, To Lady Goldstraw. Ruf. Married to that woman!â That parchment skin-full of old rattling bonesâ That relic of past agesâthat old hag, Who rides a broomstick, if there be a witchâ ThatâHell! O, hell! You joke with me. Trav. Alas! If I were only jesting! Ruf. Blast your wits! Here 's your rare plot! Trav. Yours. Ruf. No; yours, I say! You cut the whole thing out from first to last. I would be whipped if such a bungling job Called me its father. O, my luckless fate! And you, you botcher, hope you to escape? By heaven, I'll make you eat her, paint and all! Trav. Had I the stomach!â Ruf. 'Sblood! it pleases you: I see you laughing.âLaugh again, fair sir, And you shall laugh your last! Trav. Poh! poh! you 're hot. Ruf. Go to the devil, and be cooked, I pray, In all the dishes that the French cook vealâ You most egregious calf! Trav. Fair words, my friend! Ruf. Foul deeds, my foe! Trav. Well, then. Ruf. And nothing more? Draw, goose! I'll fray your feathersâdraw, thin-bloodâ I'll bleed you sweetly! [Draws and passes at Travers. Travers disarms him.] Trav. Have you reached your wits? Ruf. Pshaw! fencing-master, trickster! 't were a reach, To get my wits through you.âO, horrible! Trav. Nay, Guy, be patient. Ruf. Zounds! you talk to me! There 's Lady Alice, in the country yonderâ Stuck down among the weeds and cabbagesâ I almost love her, and she dotes on me. If I were loose, I 'd run down to her place, And marry her, by Satan!âjust to get A guardian for myself. O! fool, fool, fool! Trav. Prithee, be calm! Ruf. Prithee, beâThere, again, I came nigh swearing! See what you have done: Ruined my hopes for life, perilled my soul, AndâO! if I were in some open plain, Some empty place, where I might curse my fill In peace and quiet! Where has Darkly gone? Trav. Fled from your wrath. Ruf. And were he shod with wings, Plumed with the speed of restless Mercury, Armed with Jove's thunder, Pallas' Gorgon shield, Mars' spear, the horrid club of Herculesâ Trav. The ParcÃ¦'s chattels, Vulcan's forge and limp, Cybele's towers, the Titan's mountain load.â Go on! If he were freighted with these pagan wares, I swear you 'd find him: but with empty hands, And lithe legs stirring with a new-born terrorâ Like a shrewd thief who sees the officer, Himself unseenâ Ruf. Lord! what a tedious tongue! Out on your âperadventuresâ and âbecauses,â And âifsâ and âbutsâ! You talk a deed to death, Murder a purpose with philosophy, And sigh and moralize above its corpse, As if it died by nature. Trav. Do forbear! Your words are simply noises. I can make A better meaning from the cluck, cluck, cluck, Of a half-empty bottle of stale wine. Ruf. O, yes; I 've caught your plague: a single fool Often infects a kingdom. Trav. Hark you, Guy: I say you 're marriedâmarried to a wifeâ Ruf. And you respect her; or I'll make you, sir! A husband's title is the only one To warrant kicks, and cuffs, and hair-pullings, And other matrimonial tendernesses. 'Sdeath! I intend to make the most of her: I'll paint her up again, and frizz her curls, And make her beautiful as a Spring sun, That shines into the Winter ere you think, Melting the crusted snow to violets, And mottled crocuses, and golden grass.â By Jove! you'll envy me. Trav. (Laughing.) Ha! ha! more words. Ruf. Zounds! true. I cannot talk my grief away. Where is this holy devil, Darkly, hidden? I'll make him swear, before his mother's face, That he 's no son of hers. Poor Alice too! Trav. The country-girl? Ruf. Yes: it will kill her. Trav. Ah! What a kind heart you have! Ruf. And you, you churl,â You trimming politician, scheming Machiavell,â Who 'd trample heaven and earth beneath your feet, To gain an end!âNow, Will, I coolly tell you, That if your crafty brain do not contrive Some way for my escape, I'll murder you In cold, black blood!âTake care! Trav. Take poison! Ruf. Pah! [Exit.] Trav. His physic works too. Just one nauseous drop, Of the same drug he feeds his patient on, Has soured the doctor's nature to the core; And brought his heart up, in a dreadful state, All spotted through and through with Lady Alice! How stubborn is this criminal, the heart, That will not speak except upon the rack Of strong affliction. Now for the last stroke. (Enter Lady Goldstraw.) Lady Goldstraw. Sir William, pity me. Trav. I would do more. Say how my feelings may be put to proof. Lady G. Remove my husband for a single day; But give me time to say a prayer or two, And make provision for my helpless child, And I will slide into my timely grave So quietly that, when you ask for me, My friends shall give no answer. Trav. Say no more. Ruffler is dearer than my life to me; But weighed with you, how light a thing he seems! You who not only bear a store of charms That might make Juno pine upon her throne, And Venus drop the round Hesperian prize, Before your fuller beautiesâ Lady G. O! sir, O!â Trav. Nay, hear me, lady. This alone outweighs A world of Rufflers; but you wear a crownâ Unconsciously, and like a true-born queenâ That makes his life scarce worth the pleasant pain Of taking it. Lady G. How dreadfully you talk! Trav. Your wit strikes deeplyâyou have guessed my secretâ I see it in your eyes. Heaven's meaning glows Through their deep azure, and their fringÃ©d lids Are heavy with the tears of ecstasy. [Takes her hand.] If I interpret these celestial signs, With half the cunning of astrologers, You love me.âNay, the word is on your lips. As well might thunder burst upon the world, From the warm splendor of a sunny sky, As dread denial from that rosy mouth! Lady G. O me! O me! A fragile woman, sir, In plain, cheap clothes. Trav. What covers you is dear, And gains a sanctity from every touch That makes it radiant. Lady G. Can this be, indeed? Trav. It is, I say! Ah! promise me one smile, One look of cheer, one glance, and RufflerâNay, I'll not profane your senses with his name. I know a way to free you. I require No wages for my service. The mere act That brings content to you repays itself. Lady G. Can it be done with safety? Trav. Ay; but who Sums up the venture for a prize like this? Adieu! time calls for action. Sweet, adieu! A clear relapse, by Jove! [Aside. Exit.] Lady G. Sir William, stay! I call that love, real love. But how can he Shuffle by Ruffler; as if husbands grew, Like o'er-ripe fruit to us, and only needed A little shaking to fall off? I fear The law binds tighter than Sir William thinks. Yet wits like his are full of happy schemes. [Looks into a mirror.] Dear me! I have disfigured this poor shape By my absurd ideas. These homely robes I wore as penance for my marriage-rites, These cheeks were washed with penitential tears, These locks were shorn with penitential hands: Art shall repair my folly. Love me now! How will he love me when I come to him In all my former glory! Ha! ha! ha! [Laughing.] Another heart! Who has the impudence To call me old or faded? Madge, you child, Get to your books again: leave the field clear For my triumphant progress! Open doors! Let my state-chambers brighten up again! Call in the barbers, milliners, and knaves, That deck our person for the envious world! 'Ods love! we'll queen it, while our crown is on! [Exit, proudly.] SCENE II. (A Drawing-Room in the Same. Enter Ruffler, Travers, Goldstraw, and Madge.) Ruffler. I'm sick of it. Madge. And I. Travers. I tell you both, Your wife, sir, and your mother, gentle lady, Has not withstood the test. Madge. Nor ever will. 'T is in her nature, sir; to weed it out, Were to pull up her being by the roots. I grant that 't is a hurtful growth; yet it Has twined itself through many better things, Which are apparent to a daughter's eyes, Though lost on you. Let us endure the ill For the good's sake. I love her; that implies I love her as she is, not as you 'd make her; Nor can I now foretell if any change, Even for the better, might not change my love. What think you, Hal? Goldstraw. That you 're the best of daughters, But not, in that respect, the best of friends. Sir William 's purpose seeks your mother's good, And only indirectly aims at you. Madge. Well, well! Ruf. Pray you, consider me, good sirs. Am I a thing to push about at will? In faith, you'll find me somewhat bulky when You come to move me. Trav. But I promised youâ Did I not, Guy?âthe body of Saint Darkly, Alive or dead. And moreâ Ruf. That is enough: Let me but hack his carcass into reliques, And I will do the world some service yet. I'm ready for my part. Trav. So are the rest. [Leads Madge apart.] I'll claim your pledge anon. Madge. My pledge! Trav. The hand, The hand, fair lady, when the play is o'er. Madge. How many poets have been tricked of that! [Aside.] Gold. Your whispers are too loud for secrecy, Though quite too low for satisfaction, Madge. If you 'd be private with Sir William Travers, Withdraw; I'll hold the door, to let you pass. Madge. Why, Hal!â [Taking him apart.] Gold. Why, Madge! Madge. What, jealous of my words! Gold. If they were worthlessâ Madge. There! that pretty thing Will do unspoken. I foresee a time, A very dreary time, for little Madge. Gold. Or very merry, if she'll stand a while Out of this artificial, hot-bed world, To let that spice of coquetry dry up: A very pretty flower, to deck a maid; A thorny stalk within a marriage-bed. Trav. Come, Ruffler. Ruf. Ay, ay, Will; 't is come, good dogâ And go, good dogâandâO! you heartless wretch, Had you my weight of misery at your heart! Poor Lady Alice! [Exit with Travers.] Gold. Narrowly escaped. Here comes your mother, in full tire again, Blooming with paint, and odorous as the East With borrowed perfumes. All her curls have grown, Within an hour, beneath Sir William's breath; And what she lacks in youth, she gains in artâ A sorry patchwork! Madge. A sad spectacle! Gold. Her shroud would more become her. Madge. Hal! Gold. Forgive me. Your father's grave rose in my memory, And seemed to claim a partner. (Enter Lady Goldstraw.) Lady Goldstraw. You here, child! Get to your studies; make yourself more fit For male companionship, before you thrust Your greenness forward. Madge. Madam!â Gold. Madge!âAunt, aunt, Pray keep your honey-moon without eclipse. Lady G. My honey-moon! You sawâwhy should I blush?â [Aside.] You saw Sir William Travers pass this way? Gold. An hour ago, with your good husband, aunt;â In high words too. Lady G. I like not that. (Aside.) High words?â Such asâ Gold. âBase fool!â And âBy your leave, you lie!â And âIf you dare be brave, slave!ââ Lady G. That will do. O dear! my heart misgives me. Did he mean To kill my husband? Risk his precious life Against a drunken brawler! (Aside.) Harry, run: They'll come to mischief. Gold. Never fear. Lady G. Run, run! Procure an officer.âYou stony fool, Why stand you gaping, when their blood may flow Even while you stare at me? (Enter Hopeful, Foam, Pollen, and Marks.) Who let you in? Hopeful. Fallen idol, he who oped the wooden doors Of our lost Paradise was Nick, thy man. Marks. We would congratulate you. Foam. La! yes, madam; We kiss your hand. Pollen. I bow my colors down. Lady G. You stand there still? [Apart to Goldstraw.] Gold. In wonder. Lady G. At these fools? What brought you here?âwhat keeps you here?âAnd why, In Heaven's sweet name, do you not quit my sight? I'm on the rack, yet dare not groan! [Aside.] Marks. Your speech, Hopeful, your speech! Hope. Renowned enchantress, list! We who upon your fateful wedding-day Showered our blessings on your orange-wreath, Seeing that wreath has changed to stinging thistles, Thought it might not be an ungracious act, To come and gratulate your ladyship Upon your husband's death. Since that aloneâ Lady G. Has he run mad, at last? Hope. Mad! Marks. Sober truth: We saw the body. Hope. With more fatal stabs Than CÃ¦sar gathered in the Capitol. Pol. Why, once in Flandersâ Lady G. Silence! I shall die Before I understand you. Master Marksâ Marks. Your husband 's dead: there 's the blunt truth for you. Lady G. O, Heaven!âIâHarryâHow did he die? Pol. Why, like a soldier! Lady G. Mercy! Marks. Stabbed to death. Lady G. By whom?âQuick! Marks. No one knows. Lady G. Thank Heaven! [Aside.] (Enter Travers, his hands bloody.) You here!â What 's thisâthis stain upon your hands? Speak! speak! You did not kill him? Trav. He is yours no more. Ask me no questions. [Takes her hand. She shrinks away.] Lady G. Murderer! All. How? Trav. Look there! (Enter Ruffler, as a ghost, pointing to a wound on his breast.) Is it a phantom of my feverish brain? Orâ Lady G. Terrible! Trav. You see it, too! All. See what? Trav. Thou gory horror, wherefore art thou here? I say, I slew thee, in fair, open fight! Monsters like thee should track the murderer, Not the true man! Gold. Poor gentleman! the loss Of his old friend has quite bewildered him. Lady G. Kind Heaven, destroy my sight! Let me not look Upon this thing, and live! Gold. Aunt, are you crazed? Here 's nothing but a chairâa table here. Ay, that 's the portrait of your former husband: He looks upon you sorrowfully, I grant; But so he must have looked throughout his life. [Holds Madge back] [Ruffler advances towards Lady Goldstraw.] Lady G. Keep it away!âStand off!âI had no handâ Mine are not bloodyâin this butchery! Look at my handâO, horror! blood here, too! Ha! ha! we three wear one foul livery! Ha! ha! how like you scarlet, gentlemen, For a lord's lady? [Bursts into a laugh, and faints, supported by Goldstraw.] Madge. (Rushing forward.) Mother!â Trav. Give her air. Ruffler, go wash your ghostly colors off. [Exit Ruffler.] Fear nothing, lady: 't is the crisis, now; That past, all will be well. Madge. Ah! my poor mother!â Inhuman men!âHal Goldstraw, you as wellâ You could consent to this! Trav. Hist! she awakes. Gold. Dear aunt! Trav. How feel you, madam? Lady G. Has it gone? Gold. What has been here? Lady G. Myâmyâ Trav. You pause. Lady G. You here! Dare you to question me? Trav. Why not, my lady? Lady G. Where is my husband? Gold. Madam, you should know How long the good Lord Mayor has been entombed. Lady G. Sirs, would you mock me? Am I not a bride? Was I not married yesterday? Gold. Dear aunt, Your thoughts are wandering. You have been a widow Some fifteen years or more. Lady G. Did I not wed A loose, low ruffian, by the name of Ruffler? Was he not killed? And am I notâO, heaven! [Covers her face.] Trav. He will feel flattered at the character You have bestowed upon him. Ruffler lives, And is within your house. A sober man, I can assure you; and no more your husband Than your fair daughter, there. Lady G. Strange! Madge, come here. You have been weeping. Dry your pretty eyes. It has been all a dreamâbut such a dream! I have been ill and feverish.âAll a dream! Trav. O, yes; there was a German who believed Dream-life the true one, and our actual state A mere illusion: in that faith he died. Lady G. I 've heard of such things. It was wonderful! I have had other waking fancies, too; But they are over now. Those gentlemen, Companions of my folly, if they stay, Must not suggest my weakness: it has past. Hopeful. Queen of my heart!â Lady G. (Laughing.) That is sufficient, sir. I abdicate in favor of my child. The crown of hearts will hardly slide across My many wrinkles: here 's a smoother brow, More worth the dignity of general love, And thus I bless it. All. Long live Madge, our queen! (Enter Ruffler, dragging in Darkly, and followed by Dolly Flare.) Ruffler. Howl, villain, howl! Your agony delights me; And you, she-devil, add your cries to his; A merrier concert never struck my ear. Now, here, upon your knees, before us all, Confess your lies. Say, are you under orders? Darkly. Under your orders, as the hireling lies Beneath the master's. Ruf. But you lie without them, Much to my sorrow. Am I married?âSpeak! Dark. No, no! Ruf. You never saw me wed? Dark. No, no! Ruf. You were not present? You were in the moon, The sun, in heaven, inâ Dark. No! O! let me say One great concluding no, and end this choking. Ruf. Now, for your penance, I consign you over To Dolly Flare, forever. Dark. But my faith Forbids vain penance. I am under vows Never to mate with woman. Ruf. Under vows, You deadly papist! and not wed a woman! I'll join you to an ape, then. Dark. Must I take Thy Jezebel, thy minion, thy cast ware? Nay, throw her from the window to the dogs! Ruf. That might improve her fate. Dark. (To Dolly, who approaches him.) Avaunt, thou witch! Child of iniquity, thy touch defiles me! Dolly. Not more than yours has me. Dark. Speak, and I'll curse thee. Dol. Curse away, then: I care not for your curse. My lord, forgive me: I have lied of you, For that man 's sake. Ruf. Ho! ho! the fox is up! Darkly, sweet saint, lift up your sacred head. Here, take her hand. (Joins their hands.) I join you two in one, And throw you, thus, across the nuptial line, As boys do cats.âThere, scratch yourselves to death! Dark. O! O! the heathen rages! Wife of mine, Let us remove our habitation hence. I am inclined to cleave to theeâ [Stealing off.] Ruf. Hold, there! You shall not stir until I see you wed. Hey! Reynard, would you dodge? Dark. O! O! [Retires with Dolly.] Ruf. And you, My quondam wife, are you inclined to try A serious union with a young gallant? Here 's Travers, heart-free. Trav. Whew! Lady G. Excuse me, sir, Your friend has been explaining all to me. The process of your jest was somewhat harsh, Yet I confess 't was healthful; and, though built Upon a fiction, that may move my mirth, I see no reason why the same events, If true, might not have drained my silly eyes Of their last tear. Ruf. Travers is scorned, then? Lady G. No; Not scorned, but not accepted. Trav. Cheer up, Guy; There 's something left me. Lady, by your leave, The play is over, shall I gain the hand? [Offers to take Madge's hand.] Gold. (Interposing.) Sir, by your leave, I urge a prior claim. [Takes her hand.] Ruf. Ho! ho! Will Travers, we are gulled, I think; [Laughing.] Apollo 's tumbled from his pedestal! Nay, hark you, now, superior intellect, You look less like Minerva than her owl! O! this is too good! Some one hug me tight, Or I shall split with laughter! Travers gulled By two mere mortals! Trav. 'Sdeath! you monstrous dunce! Ruf. (Apart to Travers.) I am beginning to reform my faith: I thought Madge Goldstraw loved me. Seriously, I fear all women do not love us, Will. Trav. You should respect themâif you know yourselfâ For that one fact. Ruf. But Lady Alice! Trav. Poh! Guy, Guy, the truth will out: I really love, With all my heart, I really love sweet Madge. I scoffed at love, onceâ Ruf. Bravo! baby Cupid, This is thy vengeance! Travers, are you paid? Trav. Beyond my sin: The gods do naught by halves. Where goes the hand? [To Madge.] Madge. Where the heart went before. Gold. A gentle herald! Do not envy me The dearest blessing that has crossed my path. You have a happiness within yourself, A soul made fruitful by a teeming mind; Mine is all here, within this little hand. Your sanction, madam. Lady G. Take it. 'T is a match Your uncle planned, and smiles upon, I know: The sod lies lighter on his grave for this. Trav. Come, Guy, I want some country air. I'll plant Myself among your weeds and cabbages, Poultry, and pigs, and Lady Alices. Ruf. 'Sdeath! mend your phrases. Lady G. Gentlemen, no jars. You, who have made my marriage-day so bright With heart-felt blessings, must not bring the night Ere I enjoy the sunshine. I would see The bowl pass round among this company. Will goodness not become meâmake me fair?â Ruf. There 's the old sin, in a new shapeâbeware! Lady G. True; I'll be cautious. You have had a day Of harmless merriment; thank Heaven, I pray, For the enjoyment; and preserve your wine Safe from the bitter taint of tearful brine, Till you can pledge me in my altered carriage:â What shall the toast be, sirs? All. The Widow's Marriage!</field>
