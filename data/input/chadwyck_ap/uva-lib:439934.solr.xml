      <field name="fulltext">To my cousin and namesake, JOHN TABB HEYWARD, and to all who at any time have been my sons in Christ. Mr. John Lane, of London, publishes, along with my Poems, the Poems of Lord de Tabley; henceA COINCIDENCE The latest news About the mews! Lord Tabley And John Tabb, B. Lift up their strain In the self-same Lane. Alas!—but that's The way with cats. ON THE COVER OF JOHN B. TABB'S LATE LONDON VOLUME His eyes are dim; And so for him, They thought in London, 'twas enough To bind his book in blind-man's buff. A STRONG DOSE If brevity be soul of wit, The Boston wag discovered it In saying that my verse fulfils For him the purposes of pills. TO AN ANTE-MORTEM UNDERTAKER WHO EMBALMS ME IN VERSE If I were dead And yet had read The praise you have applied, Methinks I'd be More speedily A body mortified. And would that now I might avow A spirit quite becalmed; But, truth to tell, I seem to smell The thing you have embalmed. TO MR. ANDREW LANG, WHO SPELLED MY NAME ‘TAB’ O why should Old Lang Sign A compliment to me (If it indeed is mine), And filch my final b? To him, as to the Dane In his soliloquy, This question comes again,— “2 b or not 2 b?” CATNIP The Critic did not like the food, But found it stale and flabby; Yet strange to say, no other chewed So hard the hapless Tabby. It had a poet of its own, But undertook to gild her— A thing, as well they might have known, That ultimately killed her. And such had been poor Tabby's fate But that some power divine Let it by underestimate To take one life for nine. AN OBJECTOR “Some folk,” the Monkey says, “there be That claim descent from mine and me; But I respectfully decline Such compliments to me and mine.” IN CHICAGO Of forthcoming weather no prophet have they, For the ground hog is there to be seen every day. INGERSOLL'S DILEMMA Says Bob to the Devil, “I do not believe In the doctrine of hell—nor in you!” Says the Devil to Bob, “You must, or be damned!” Says Bob, “I'll be damned if I do!” QUEEN BESS Or praise or obloquy is hers, As history has viewed her To some a 1-der she appears, To others but a 2-dor. A DISCONCERTED CONCERT Bull father frog Was on the log, While many a little fellow Around the pool Upon his stool Sat learning how to bellow. A turtle near, Whom all did fear,— An enemy to noises— His head upsent, And down they went To drown, alas, their voices. WOOL-GATHERING O briar-bush! how beautiful! May I a little blossom pull For memory to keep? “To take it, sir,” she said, “you're free; But know it didn't bloom on me,— I got it from a sheep.” THE SECRET To a Dimple said a Frown, “I would give you half a crown, To teach me how a compliment to win.” To the Frown replied the Dimple, “Why the trick is very simple:— Dance on tiptoe all around the mouth and chin.” AN IMPROVEMENT The knights of old, As we are told, Each bore a weight of mail. But they were slow; And letters go Much faster now by rail. CORN-COB You look, like Grandpa, very old; And that is why, no doubt, Your skin is shrivelled by the cold, And all your teeth are out. THE YARDSTICK The laziest of all things strong, The Yardstick seems to me, For, with three feet, twelve inches long, No step alone takes he. THE SNORER Along her slumber-shodden way The Nightmare goes cavorting; The rider sleeping, strange to say, In spite of all her snorting. He should, I think, for others' sake, Prevent her, if he's able, From keeping all the world awake, Or put her in the stable. WHAT'S IN A NAME? A pious prelate used to ride A donkey which, alas,— His patience being often tried— He called Eu-damid-as:— A name he emphasized or not, As grew his temper cool or hot. A PERPLEXITY In a piece of woollen cloth, Lived a maid and mother moth, But to both it was a bother, Which was moth and which was mother. TROUBLED WATERS O water, when I put you here, You were as smooth as oil; Why are you now so ruffled, dear? “I'm troubled with a boil.” A QUESTION OF TIME When Time was young, he must have had A lovely suit of hair, And it is very, very sad To see his skull so bare. But since he's able still to mow, And strong enough to dig, I wonder why he doesn't go And get himself a wig. AN INCUBUS Sobbed the Blotter to the Ink, “Though your every word I drink, Your broken lines alone are my reward.” “The truth,” said he, “you've spoken; And no wonder they are broken When you press me so incessantly and hard.” THE TUMBLE-BUG In Egypt of old You were sacred, I'm told; How fell you in man's estimation? “Each dog has his day, And each Bug, I dare say, Takes his turn with the rest of creation.” AN AVERSION The apple-tree Is not to me A thing of special joy: It did deceive my mother Eve, And often pain her boy. And as to her, I must aver I've had a mind to chide her When, racked with pain, I've wished in vain My apples were in cider. A MIXED MARRIAGE Said Tom to Pussie, “Out of nine, Eight lives I'd give to make you mine.” “Alas,” said Pussie with a tear, “I'd not so long outlive you, dear!” Whereat, with plighting paw and purr, Nine lives to nine united were. THE MAN IN THE MOON The Night is gloomy and forlorn Until her baby Moon is born, But long he does not stay; For, though he's very pale and slim, A fortnight makes a man of him, And then he goes away. IN THE AUTHOR'S LIBRARY To see, when he is dead, The many books he read; And then again to note The many books he wrote— How some got in and some got out, 'Tis very strange to think about. POLITENESS The Turtle met the Terrapin, And, as they were the closest kin, Each asked the other with a grin, To take his top off and come in. A MOUTHPIECE Why is the baby crying? You must have scared or hit him. “No, grandpa, I was trying If your false teeth would fit him.” OBSCURITY To his father said a bunny, “Don't you find it rather funny That we know so very little of our race?” “What's behind is a tradition,” Said the sire, “that tail-omission Makes it utterly impossible to trace.” PINCHBECK To jewels her taste did incline; But she had not a trinket to wear Till she slept after taking quinine, And awoke with a ring in each ear. A SAINT'S INFIRMITY Your father's deafness—was it cured When he Saint Anthony implored? “No,” said the child, “'twas not to be: Saint Anthony was as deaf as he.” A MISTAKE How have you the heart, O Bumble Bee, To sting a little boy like me? “'Tis not the heart, my little friend, I'm using; but the other end.” FASCINATION Among your many playmates here, Why is it that you all prefer Your little friend, my dear? “Because, Mamma, tho' hard we try, Not one of us can spit so high, And catch it in his ear.” UNSTATIONARY STATIONERY The Wax waxed hotter and hotter Till the Seal took his seat on her back, And the Pen wiped his foot on the Blotter, And laughed at them both from the Rack. A RASH JUDGMENT He sat beside the well, And leaning o'er the brink, Down to the bottom fell And died, they thought, of drink. But when they raised the trunk To dry it on the grass, They found the water drunk, But he quite sober was. IN ACCORD The Mocking-bird gulps down the worm And straight begins to sing. I wonder that he doesn't squirm To swallow such a thing— A sort of fiddle-string, no doubt, That helps to bring the music out. FACIAL LATITUDE How far the lip below the nose, 'Tis very hard to say; But every indication shows It is miles, it's miles away. A FOOT-RULE Biped, or Quadruped, Two feet or four: That's the standing rule of feet All the world o'er. Two feet, or four feet, Never one or three. “Nay,” said the Yard-stick, “Don't forget me!” “Ho!” cried another voice, A one-foot thing, “I'm the Rule of Measurement; ‘Every inch a King.’” A MARK OF TRUE GREATNESS He used to sit beneath this tree, And sometimes on the limb, Where the impression that you see Shows just the size of him. FROM ABROAD He wrote that through Finland, While journeying inland, The Fins, but no fishes he found. But in Lapland, he said, He was seldom misled For lapfuls of babies abound. THE TOAD At twilight from his dark abode Leaps forth the wart-besprinkled Toad: He does not like the day; Nor would we, either, if like him, We were repulsive, moist and grim, Be fond of self-display. A DIVERSION “How doth the little busy bee Improve each shining hour?” Alas! I hope not as it came to pass When, of the hour forgetful, he Was busily “improving” me. THE HERMIT “Come,” throbbed the Thumb To the other four Fingers, “In a glove let us shove While the icicle lingers; “Tho' the weather together Keeps each near his own, In a small private stall I must winter alone.” A DEPRIVATION Can you, sweet roses, ever take A breath of other roses? “Alas, your nosegay we can make, But none of us have noses.” A HOUSE OF REFUGE All down into their mother's throat The little sharks from danger float; And there it is that they remain Dry-sheltered when it comes to rain; For by sea-doctors they are told Fresh water's apt to give them cold. UNDERSIZE The flea a dog may bite And not again be bitten: The bee a bull may smite, And yet escape unsmitten. For stronger foes are put to flight By enemies too small to fight. A FOOT-NOTE From Bunyan Pilgrim's Progress came As essence from an onion; And, by reversion of the same, From pilgrim's progress,—bunion. THE PRODIGAL Hissed the father, “Let him go! Though I very well do know That a gosling from the ganderdom let loose, Will, within another year, Make it manifestly clear That he has but grown to be a greater goose.” VALUATION “Pray tell me how you estimate The wolf,” I asked a lamb. “My own opinion, sir, to state, He is not worth a dam.” TO MY SHADOW You skulked behind me like a hound, And now you run before. “But, master, if you turn around, I'll get behind once more.” A MUSICIAN'S TRIAL They brought him up before the Judge. “What is the fellow's crime?” “Your Honor, he has murdered Scores, And boasts of beating Time.” TREASURE-TROVES “What are you doing, Butterfly?” Inquired the Honey Bee. “You seem as fond of flowers as I, And yet I do not see What benefit you gain thereby.” “Ah, gentle Sir,” said she, “Be yours the profit they supply, And mine the poetry.” A CHANGE OF PARTS When Barrel-organs with us stayed, The Monkey danced, the Master played; But comes the Pianola, And now the Monkey has a chance To play, and make the Master dance, From Bath to Pensacola. THE SANDPIPER Of birds he is the most polite; For, be it foe or friend, To every one that comes in sight He bows at either end. HEAD-STRONG Said the Goat to the Ram, “Ring-leader I am Of this flock in whose pasture we run.” Said the Ram with a strut, “We may prove it so—but— But—two heads are better than one.” THE MOUSE AND THE ELEPHANT “I tell you, if you don't obey, I'll run right up your snout.” “Well, I will do whate'er you say— But, man alive! keep out.” HIGH-BORN So far her head above her feet That when the lady takes a seat The interval 'twixt hip and knee The length of Lapland seems to be. ACCOMMODATING “Spare, O spare me!” cried the Snail, As the Sparrow pounced upon it. Then the other shook his tail— “Sparrowed, would you? Well, I've done it!” A DISAGREEMENT “You give me no rest,” growled the Patient. “I cannot,” retorted the Pill. “In your stomach to be Is so dreadful to me That I can't for a moment keep still.” A COMPENSATION A squirrel, while he sprang from tree to tree, Cried to a skunk below, “Pray, look at me: There's no such grace nor such agility As mine, I tell you!” “Nay, friend,” the simple creature made reply, “Thy gifts, forsooth, no mortal may deny; But pray remember 'tis my boast that I By far outsmell you.” THE BROOK TO THE LAMB Leap across me, little lamb; But I can't invite your dam, Or it would at once, you know, prevent my flowing. “O how different are we!” Said the lamb, “for, as you see, My dam it is alone that keeps me going.” JUST THE REVERSE “You go to bed at twelve or one, And thus destroy your health, my son.” “No, sir,” the boy said drowsily, “It's getting up that's killing me.” EXIT Said a corpulent Bubble, “It is my great trouble, This shortness of breath to prevent; But folks over-stout Are advised to go out, So out shall I go,”—and she went. SPRING CHIMNEYS To throats so long in misery Of thirst and parching pain, How welcome must each swallow be That now they take again! THE DIFFERENCE Unc' si, de Holy Bible say In speakin' of de jus', Dat he do fall seben times a day; Now how's de sinner wuss? “Well, chile, de slip may come to all, But den de difference foller; For, ef you watch him when he fall, De jus' man do not waller.” A STING “Men speak,” said the Wasp, “of the provident Ant, Because of her miserly taste; But greatly I wonder why see it they can't, That we have as little to waist.” A WISH At night, I'd like to be a bird, In every sort of weather To go to bed and rise again And never change a feather; But in the morning, I'd prefer The life I now enjoy; For what would satisfy a bird Would never fill a boy. A BACHELOR HEN Upon the nest she was a hen, But higher aims induced her To get upon the roost; and then She found herself a rooster. IRONY “It is one of Nature's wrongs,” Sneered the Shovel to the Tongs, “To have led your legs so very far astray.” “Ah, she made us both in haste,” Observed the Tongs, “and from your waist, She has nicked your neck as far the other way.” What the Poker as a joker thought, He didn't dare to say. A FAMILY FAILING Sneezed the Pepper, “Sister Salt Bids me say 'tis not her fault That she's out of place to-day; Turning, just below the Caster, She upset, and the disaster Holds her back in Mustard-plaster That she cannot scrape away.” “That trick of turning round she got,” Said Vinegar, “from Mrs. Lot.” CHERRIES O share with us, bird in the tree, The fruit you are taking alone! “You're welcome to half,” He chirped with a laugh,— And thereupon threw me a stone. WITH CHOLERA MORBUS I am so sick I'd like to be A clock, to have them open me And regulate the jerks, When on the pendulum a Pain Is riding forth and back again, And pulling at my works. DREAD OF JUSTICE Sighed Dumpling, “Do not put me, please, With Cabbage in the pot. I don't object to boil with Peas; But she, when she is hot, Has such a smell that half you see, Would certainly be laid on me.” A CATTLE PLAGUE “What ails you?” tenderly I spoke To a dejected calf. He answered, “At a killing joke I'm dying, sir, to laugh. They little know, who lightly jest, The agony of fun suppressed.” A FLEDGLING “Why is it, little chick,” I said “That you so ragged go?” “Alas,” he answered, “father's dead And mother cannot sew. “She does her very best to lay, Till I have learned to crow; But bread is rising every day, And eggs, alas, are low.” MR. DOOLITTLE'S EPITAPH Do little he did, and so true to the call Was his life, that at last he did nothing at all. TAMING THE SHREW “Turn round,” puffed the Wind to the Mill. “I won't!” she replied; and stood still. But he struck her a blow That compelled her to go, And since then she submits to his will. THE SIGNAL “Where are you going, Sleep?” I said. “To put a little boy to bed. I told him when he needed me, To nod; and nodding now is he.” A DEDUCTION “I can't, for my life,” Quacked the Drake to his wife, “Tell which of our children are males.” Said the Duck with a smile, “We must wait for a while And observe which have curls in their tails.” HEART-BROKEN The Limbs beneath a cruel strain Were sobbing, “Heaven defend us!” Then, snapping suddenly in twain, They cried aloud, “Tree-mend-us!” A BLIND MAN'S EPITAPH. His eyes were dim; so here he lies, Whose death came after his dim-ise. EMETICS With all the battles that he won That brought him world-renown, Imperious Napoleon Could never keep us down. TO A PROPOSED INTERVIEWER An interview would be to me A sort of an emetic, Or an appendix to be cut Without the anæsthetic; And why expose to public view A man's intestine features? 'Tis outwardly alone we look Unlike our fellow-creatures. FOREDOOMED Of reprobates the beaver seems The saddest in creation, His every instinct kindling dreams To work for his dam-nation. JUDICIOUS “I cannot kiss you, Ike,” she said. “Why not?” he asked. Then hesitating, “Because,” she whispered, “I've the pledge— And juleps are intoxicating.” INFATUATION Each day at a dinner of State, His neighbors observed what he ate Was sufficient for three Less determined than he To be reckoned a person of weight. NO STICKLERS Toothpicks!—were ever sticks Less “stuck up” in their way! With upper teeth and those beneath On equal terms are they. A TALE OF REVERSE, or THE REVERSE OF A TAIL The dog that caught the mink Was strolling down the street, When, quicker than a wink, He chanced a maid to meet, Inhabiting the skin That once his victim wore; But, lo, beneath her chin The tail was now before! “Alas,” he sighed, “'tis passing strange How fashion with our fortunes change!” SYMPATHY Why are you weeping, little lad? “Because (Boo-hoo!), it makes me sad To see my thumbs (Boo-hoo!) so far From where the other fingers are,— Boo-hoo! Boo-hoo!” THE SENSITIVE LOBSTER He floundered from the breakers cool Into a boiling pot, Where, thinking some egregious fool Had made the water hot,— Ashamed of such stupidity, He blushed as red as red could be. THE ROOT OF PRIDE Of great-great-grandpapa, I know, My parents speak with pride; But what he did to make him so I never can decide. Perhaps, as sweet potatoes do, 'Twas under ground so great he grew. GOOD ADVICE The Keyhole quarrelled with the Key Because he said agape was she To whispering suggestion; Then, each appealing to the Door, He counselled them to fight no more About an open question. THE RUN-A-WAY Where are you going, little Rill? “Alas, I cannot say! I leaped the fountain on the hill, And ventured forth to play; And now it seems, against my will, I am a run-a-way.” EXTREMES MEET The giant and the baby Present a striking pair; Whatever else the difference, Long clothes alike they wear; While Life, diverted, must admit, They show the long and short of it. CLOSE AS WAX The miser met the Bumble Bee And asked a drop of honey. “My honey-bag's as tight,” said she, “As are your bags of money.” A PARADOX I wish the weather-cock would crow To let his fellow chickens know That weather fair's for maids and men, Fowl weather is for cock and hen. A(N)ICE DISTINCTION 'Tis hard for some skaters to stand; but for all, Though it's easy to slip, it is harder to fall. THE BLUEBIRD TO THE CANARY As you're a yellow little fellow, I hope you do not mean To come too near; for blending, dear, Would turn our feathers green. COMPENSATION She says of life's remaining joy, To her I am the anchor: 'Tis meet; for when I was a boy, To me she was the spanker. A THREAT “No; Wide-a-Wake,” persisted Sleep, “I'll not come near you till you keep As quiet as a mouse; And if you stretch your eyelids so, To see if I am here or no, I'll have to quit the house.” A TRAGEDY His padding was of sawdust, The little Soldier-man Who loved a light-haired lady Doll— A maiden stuffed with bran. Their little hostess never knew That they had each a heart, But lodged them in the baby-house In corners far apart; Till once, in curiosity, She pierced the Soldier-man, Ripped up the maiden Doll, and mixed The sawdust with the bran. A RETORT The Finger complained of the Toe, And said it was idle and slow; But it answered in scorn, “On each foot I grow corn; What on hand are you able to show?” AN EXCUSE Upon my soul, O wicked mole, I'll punish thy misdoing! “O pardon me!— I could not see The course I was pursuing.” SAUSAGE We are ground, but no more grounded In our family affairs: What is found, is so confounded That no Sausage longer cares To determine how or what he Owes the family of Pork, In the pens of Cincinnati, Of Chicago, or New York. IN AMBUSH “'Tis well,” the Goat, flea-bitten said, “You hide where Nature put you: For if you dared to show your head, By Gemini, I'd butt you!”</field>
