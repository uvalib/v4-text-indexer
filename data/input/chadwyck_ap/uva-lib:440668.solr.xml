Otho, the Bastard, Lord Ola, a Stranger, Prince Irman, Duke Alva, Father of Irman, The Soldier, Achmet, a follower of Otho, Selim, a Page, Friar, Judge, Lords, Attendants, &amp;c. &amp;c. Princess Ala, Ida, child of Duke Alva, Laie, favourite attendant of the Princess. ACT I. SCENE I. âA thick woodâdistant view of a fortressâgroupes of armed men, as after a battle;âsound of distant tumultâmartial music. Prince Irman insensible, supported on a back by a man in armour, while others are attempting to free him from his harness. 1st Guard. (Advancing) Stand to your ground! (To others who approach.) Away!âand man the pass. 2d Guard. Silence!âlook there!âthe wood is full of men. 1st Gua. (Looking anxiously) But they are all white plumesâ (Advancing to his companion, who is supporting the Prince.) It was a heavy blowâ 3d Gua. (Reaching the cleft Helmet of the Prince to his comrade.) It was indeed. Both. No blood!ânot wounded! 3d Gua. âNo!âhe's only stunnedâ (throwing down the Helmet) And we are gloriously revenged for that! (To others, who approachâas a distant shout is heard) Back to your posts!â 2d Gua. Away! and scour the woodsâ 3d Gua. âSoftâsoftâhe breathesâ (Prince Irman faintly attempts to riseâstaggersâand sinks down again.) 3d Gua. My Prince!â (The Prince looks around disturbed, as struggling to recollect himself, in silence.) (Enter Friar.) Friar. (Stopping suddenly as he sees the Prince's armour lying about.) Merciful Powers!âit was a dreadful shock! 1st Gua. Aye Fatherâ(reaching the cloven Helmet) What a blade!â Friar. (In amasement) And yet he has escaped! (laying his hand upon the Prince's brow.) 1st Gua. Unharmed,âand only stunnedâbutâ 3d Gua. Shall we not bear him to the Castle, Father? 2d Gua. Aye, father, 'twould be best,âhe's not safe hereâ The woods are all alive with Otho's menâ 1st Gua. (Angrily) With Otho's devilsâJesu! how they fought! 3d Gua. To the Castle then! (approaching the Prince, eagerly.) Friar. StayâStayâ Let him but breathe the pure, fresh air, And he'll not want our aid to reach his halls; And there he'll meet his Princess, as he's wont, When he has been in bloodâ (Martial flourish heard, passing, in the wood.) Silence that horn!â (Trumpetâthe Prince starts suddenly from the bank, utters some incoherent sounds, and attempts to unsheath his swordâFriar and guard struggle with him.) Prince. (Vehemently) To horse!âAway!âAway! Fr. Nayânay my Lordâ 1st Gua. (Again preventing the Prince from unsheathing his sword.) My Prince! Pri. (Starting, and looking earnestly at him) âSelim! 1st Gua. Not Selimâno, my Princeâ Fr. âSpeed to the hall; Tell Selim to return.â (Several start at once with great eagerness.) Pri. (Bursting from their arms and unsheating his Sword) Charge, charge!âthey fly!âthere, cleave him to the earth! Away! Away! (Rushes furiously out, followed by all his guards, the Friar last.) Fr. The sword! the sword! (following, with violent gestures) Aye, wrench it from his graspâ (Exit Friar.) (Enter Achmet, cautiously, from the wood.) Achmet. They're gone at last!â(listening) Curse on the straggling cowards! we are foiledâ (Two other Figures seen, stealing upon him from the wood.) Have lost our chief:âwould I had fallen there! Who of us all will dare to lift an eye, Hereafter,âto that dark encountering look? (The ruffians approach with their daggers drawn) How shall I quail before that mute reproach! So terrible!âso stillâ (sees them) âWho are ye?âStand! Come ye as friends, or foes?â (they approach) âAnother step!â And I shall hold ye foesâ (Looks earnestlyâapproachesâdrops the point of his sword, and turns away in scorn) Cowards!âI know ye bothâ Away!âI hold no fellowship with youâ (goingâpauses) Ye sold your chiefâabandoned him in deathâ 1st Ruf. 'Tis falseâhe sold himselfâ 2d Ruf. âAye, so he did! Think ye they'd ever taken him alive, But with his own consent?â 1st Ruf. I saw him break his bladeâand bow his headâ And yield himself a prisoner to the foe.â Ach. TrueâTrue, you did. His mighty heart gave up When ye abandoned him,âor he had fought, Till not a man survived to tell the tale. But we!âno, youâI did my duty there: And yet, I shall not dare to meet his eyeâ For I have marched with cowards to the war. How then will ye encounter his reproach? That withering look!âthat eyesâwhen ye shall see Your chief to-morrow, going to his death. Both Ruf. His death!âhis death! Ach. Aye, all alone, his head upon a blockâ (The ruffians appear disturbedâhesitateâthen suddenly brandish their daggers, as if unconsciously) Aye stretched upon the wheelâ (keeping his eye upon them) 1st Ruf. (to his fellow) By Heaven, I will!â (The other seizes his handâas understanding his exclamation) Ach. (Going) Gods! ye had better die ten thousand deaths, In strife for him, than once deserve that glance;â That lightning!â'twill reward ye for your faithâ O! may ye see him die!â Both. Die!âHe die! 1st Ruf. No, no, we'll save him yet,â 2d Ruf. âor die ourselves. Ach. Ye save him, cowards!âhe would rather die. No, never!âneverâye that broke his heart! Ye never can restore him to himself.â Ye were the men that he had nursed in blood His chosen ones!âhis strength! (pauseâemotion) âAnd ye deserted him! No, he will die.âAnd ye shall are see your chief Hooted and pelted by a peasant rabbleâ 1st Ruf. By Heaven! they dare not. 2d Ruf. We will all be thereâ Ach. Ye! O cowards! cowards! Think ye that he would trust to you again! Go seek your caverns, hide yourselvesâand live. For meâI will attend him to the block; (emotion) He yet shall look on me as he was wont, When I had been a man,âand thenâI'll die. But ye!âO, may ye meet his eye once more! 1st Ruf. Achmet, lead onâ 2d Ruf. âAye, lead us where thou wilt! We'll follow thee to death. Ach. Ye follow me to death! O, were ye men, We had been masters of the citadel; The Prince had been our prisoner!âand his guards Had fed the vulture and the wolf this night. Aye,âeven nowâhad ye been men indeed, We might have taken such a hostage hereâ (Ruffians appear violently agitated) But now, the Prince was here! (stamping) âUpon this spot! 1st Ruf. We saw him too. 2d Ruf. His guards were all aboutâthe wood was full, And what could we have done! Ach. What could we have done! Why, borne him off, amid a thousand guards! Had we been Otho's men. 1st Ruf. Then we may do it now! 2d Ruf. Aye, let us! let us!âAchmet, lead us forth. Ach. (Triumphantly) Would ye redeem your souls? Away! and I will trust ye yet. (Rushes out as after the Prince,âfollowed by the Ruffians.) SCENE II. âA Gothick hall. View of Battlements from an open window. Banners and armour hung around. The Prince is discovered on a couch. Friar. Fr. Yes my Lordâand broke his swordâand (The recollection of the Prince alternately comes and goes through this scene, until its conclusion, when he is entirely restored.) Pri. (Impatiently) And then was taken: Yes, I know it all. (relapses into inattention) Fr. (Eagerly) The Princess comesâ Pri. (Disturbed) Ah!â Fr. I hear her voice, my lordâ Pri. The Princessâ?âHa! Fr. The Lady Alaâ Pri. Ala! (passionately)âis that her voice? Fr. Yes, yes, my Prince. Pri. â(struggling)âThen let me be composed! Ala,âmy lovely oneâbear up my heartâ That angel smileâ (wandering) Father, that Othoâ (laying his hand on his brow) I am much disturbed. (Enter Ala, followed by her ladies.) Ala. Welcome my Prince! (Stops in alarm at the expression of his countenance.) Father, what tale have ye amused me with? (Bends over the Prince and takes his hand in great agitation.) My Prince look up! (he lifts his eyes wildly) âIn mercy!âlook not thus. (Reproachfully.) Father!âFatherâ (weeps) Fr. Sweet lady, these are dangerous tears: The Prince but wants reposeâ (Ala wares to her attendants to withdrawâseats herself by the Prince, and supports his head.) Ala. Father, (in a low voice) I pray the Duke may not arrive. This is a mournful presage, and my heart Bows sadly to its touch. (The Prince with a sudden and faint cry of terror draws her nearer to him.) My Prince! (startled.) Indeed, his eye looks wildâ Pri. (Straining her to his heart convulsively) AlaâO, Ala!â (Pauseâappears to recollect her.) My Ala!âhere! And art thou here, my love?âIs this thy hand? Why even thou art paleâ (relapsing) Yes, yes it was a fearful dream indeed. (Ala averts her head and weeps) Nay, do not leave me Ala. I would feel. Thy hand in mine. My heart still knows the touch Of one it lovesâ (Tremblesâstrugglesâand suddenly extends his hands, as to prevent something from approaching herâ then drops them faintly as she covers her face.) âO, would'st thou leave me then! Well,âgo!âI've nothing left to cling to here. (Ala is overcome by her feelings. Irman rises proudly, advances with a firm step to the middle of the hall âattempts to address Alaâand suddenly stopsâas conscious of his situation.) Forgive me! I am weak.â(pause) that flash!â (Catches her hand and appears completely restored) Ala,âwhy, how is this? So sad upon this night; Our wedding nightâ (His eye falls on his armour: as he sees his cleft helmet, he, involuntarily, passes his hand to his brow) My plumes are soiledâtheir lights are dimmedâ(pause.) Ah, now I feel it all! â(passionately) And art thou safe! Well, thanks to Heaven!âbut indeed my love, I never heard the trumpet pealing yet; Or saw my banners blazing for the strife, And felt my pulse so feeble, as this day. That desperate man! He is a gallant foe, And tho' I stooped to his encountering arm, My heart does not reproach me for the fail. He wields a dreadful blade. (Pauseâlays his hand on the Friar's arm, as striving to recall his thoughts, while Ala expresses her delight at his recovery, in silence.) But Fatherâsurely, we were victors there; I saw them fly before I fellâ Fr. 'Tis true my lord. The dreadful man is here; A prisonerâwith his bloody band. Irman. A prisoner! Otho!âand alive! Fr. And aliveâ'tis true my Prince. Pri. (To Ala) That Otho here! He would have torn thee from the altar, loveâ Ala. Ah! (terrour) Pri. Yes! from my armsâor from the bridal couch! Ala. Merciful Heaven! (shudderingâthen advancing, seizes his hand.) Art thou indeed restored! Fr. Now, lady, did I tell thee true? Ala. Father, forgive me, 'twas my fear that spoke: Know you, my Prince, how, wildly you have talked? Fr. Indeed, your lovely guardian was alarmed. Pri. I raved? Ala. O, yes! and held my hand, as if you strove To save me from pollutionâ Pri. (With tenderness) Did I indeed! (pause) (Solemnity) YesâyesâI know I didâ The chill of superstition is upon me: Nay, do not smileâmy brain is quite restored, But this delirium is in my heart. The blow that fell had not unmanned me thus, Had not my heart and scul been wandering firstâ But nowâthis eveningâsomething threatens me, I yet shall realize my dreadful dream: My fallâthe trumpetâand the foeâ Ala. A dream! Pri. Indeed! I have not told thee? well, 'twas this. I dreamt that thou wast gone, (horrourâgradually increasing to vehemence.) And that I clasped Before the multitude, assembled there To see us plight our faith for earth and heaven,â Instead of thee, my love, with sunny eye,â A man in armour! whose relentless grasp Was locked in desperation round my frame. So unexpected too! (pause) and what is strange, I dreamt that thou did'st leave me willinglyâ Ala. (Tenderly) Willingly! Fr. It was a dream, my Prince. Pri. (Disturbed) But mark the strange concurrence of this day. The very man I've heard so often cursed, (to Ala) When I have told thee of his bloody deeds; This very Otho! was the ruffian shape, Thatâmailed from head to footâin sable plumesâ Stepped forth, amid a troop of gallant Lords, And clasped me while I slept! To night he comesâand blows a sudden trump! And sabres flash! and martial hands are metâ In battleâthat had come for dance! Ala. And didst thou see him in thy dream? (smiling) Pri. Yesâsmile my loveâ He frightens others in their soundest sleep. And idle as the fear might seem, to one, Less near the object of idolatry; Yet stillâon meâI wonder while I speakâ And thenâ (Enter Selim, who falls at his feet with a look of the greatest reverence and affection.) (To Selim) Has my father come? Selim. Not yet, my Prince. He will be here to-night, A courier has arrivedâ Pri. (continuing with earnestness) The unexpected bursting of that trump! Within the very temple of our hopes! The boldness of the bandâthy strange escapeâ For, had we been embracing to receive Thy benediction, fatherâand my knights Had been unarmed, as knights should be, who meet For nuptial revelry, and dance,âOh, then, Most surely had I lost thee, love! Ala. (In deep thought) Indeedâbut this as strange, night after night Have I had visions too. (to the Prince.) And much like this. Thrice have I dreamt that I was snatched from death. That, from the Altar, I was borne away, (faltering) By that dark fearful beingâ (Shuddering and looking round in terrourâSelim is seen to participateâand, involuntarily, raises his hands, as he stands listening intensely) âThat my heart Once met in solitudeâarrayed in blood! A bloody mantle! And a bloody plume! (increasing horrour) And suddenly he cameâas from the grave! Butâ (recovering, and struggling to assume a cheerful tone) âThis is idleâ Pri. Yes, my loveâ And I can well account for dreams like mine. This savage Otho is so full of wiles; And strikes such sudden blows in day and nightâ And I, so near the object of my prayers: (more cheerfully) These fearful visions of my troubled sleep, But make me feel thy value when I wake. Our Heaven is never certain, 'till possessed; Our dreams are tinctured by our waking fears, Tillâwhat was but uncertain bliss in day, Becomes consuming agony at night. But Alaâto thy maidens, loveâsuch hours Should not be spent in fearsâand doubtsâand dreams. Ala. Nay, nay, My Prince. (faintly) The Duke has not arrived. And thou art not recovered from the strife; We should be more composedâ Pri. (Passionately) Ala, I cannot suffer thus; I cannot thus be frozen with delaysâ Nay, Ala, look not thus! I've stood too long Upon this dizzying heightâand must descend. Ala! I've loved thee longâ How I have loved thee, thou canst never know! I should go mad if I were baffled now! Away with all these doubts! Away with tears! Be worthy of thyself! My Ala, let us wed! And then the trumpet will not peal in vain; Yea, should it startle me from sleep, this night, Upon my bridal couch, my heart will beat Ten thousand times more worthy of its prize, Than now, while I am shaken thus. To-night! Farewell, my loveâto-night! (Exit Ala) (To Selim) Are the prisoners safe? Selim. All safeâ (acclamations heardâbugle, Selim runs to the window) There they go! Pri. The prisoners, there! Why are those clamorous shouts? Can that be insult to the conquered men? Begone, and silence themâunmanly triumph! Selim. (Eagerlyâwithout looking round) 'Tis done! 'tis done! my Prince. The Soldier's there. How mute they are! Pri. The Soldier! my preserver? bring him here. Yes, I must see that manâ (Suddenly) But Selim, lookâis Otho with his men To hear these vile rejoicings? Selim. (Springing from the window.) O, no! we'd hear no shouts if he were there. Pri. Ah! (pauseâlooking at Selim.) âHe is no common man. And had they shouted o'er his fallen strength, He might forgive it, but I never would, (Indignantly) I never would have pardoned them on earth! How bears the murderer his approaching fate! Selim. Murderer! Pri. Aye! Didst thou not know it boy? Selim. No, no, my Prince; he has a warriour's eye; But not a murderer'sâ Pri. Boy, boy! How bears he this reverse? Selim. In bitter resignationâsilentâsternâ Pri. (Enthusiasm) What stormy greatness is abandoned there! O, that I might be merciful, and just! He's so magnificent! (Pauseâworking of passionâSelim falls at his feet in supplicationâthe Prince subdues his feelingsâand adds in a determined tone) No, noâthat man must die. Selim. O, spare his life! he might have taken thine? Pri. Selim! he must die. Where went my barb? Has he gone wild again? Selim. I fear he hasâ (Friar advances from the windowâeagerly) Fr. My Prince, they say he galloped towards the hills! (Enthusiasm) And shook his bloody maneâ And plunged along, Yet reeking with his woundâas if he heard, A trumpet in the skies! as if he felt His native mountain air brace all his limbs again! Pri. (Looking at him with astonishment) Father! thou hast been a warriour once. Fr. Aye that I have! and in the blessed sun Have seen a steed, caparisoned for war! Aye, that I have! and in the stillest night, Have heardâa battle in the Heavens! For I was young. (faltering) In other days my sonâ I've seen the flashing mane and rolling eye; But now (raising the Cross) I shake at blood. Pri. (Bowing reverently to the symbol of peace) He is a gallant steedâ (Exit Friar) I never strode a barb that moved so proud: How he leapt forth to meet the glittering spears! Did'st see him, Selim? plunging to the blast: I felt the trumpet in his shaking chest: But I forget my gratitudeâaway! Summon the soldier. (Selim is going) Dost thou know his name? Selim. That is his only name: he lives unknown. The Soldier, he is called, by all the troops; And he is poorâand braveâ Pri. Aye that he isâbut this is his reward. The Soldier! It is a glorious name! O, give me but a band Of such old men as that, I'd shake the world. Selim. (To a guard) Summon the Soldier! (The word is heard passing along the battlements from Sentry to Sentry.) Pri. Stayâlead me to his tent. I'll meet him there; Such men are always proudâ And he will thank me if I spare that pride. (Exit, followed by Selim) SCENE III. âFoot of the BattlementsâMoonlightâSentries MarchingâLine of Barracks stretching to a distance. Platform in front. (Enter Prince, followed by Selim.) Pri. Which are his quarters, Selim? Selim. (Looking about) Indeed, I do not knowâbutâ Pri. Inquireâ Selim. (Observing one apartment not lighted) Ah yes! 'tis there (pointing) 'tis there the Soldier sleeps. Pri. Art thou sure? Selim. O, yes, he never burns a light. Pri. Knock! (Selim taps gently) Soldier. (within, in a sullen voice) Who goes there? Selim. A Friend! Sol. Who e'er ye are, away! Disturb me not! Pri. Open the door, Selim. (Selim crowds against it) Sol. (Furiously) Who dares disturb my solitude, When he has heard my voice? Begone! (Rushes out, and pursues Selim with a drawn sword) I told you I was not to be disturbed. (pauses, as Selim retreats to a light) A boy! ah well, go home. (Sees the Prince, who has advanced to protect Selim) âSo! ye are two. Well then, I'll teach ye to assault me thus! (Strikes at the Prince, Selim throws himself before him) Selim. Madman! 'tis the Prince! (The Soldier throws down his sword, folds his arms and stands in an attitude of martial dignity) Pri. (To Selim) Command the guards to leave the gate awhile. Sol. Stay boy! thou wilt not be obeyed. (Wares his hand, guard approaches with an expression of awe: the Soldier nods in silence, and the platform is instantly cleared.) Pri. (Contemplating the whole with earnest attention) Soldier! thy hand fell heavily to-day; But unexpected battle finds thee, still, With heaven closed, bright harness, and a lance Forever couch'd to guard thy Prince's life; There is a purse of goldâ (The soldier turns slowly towards him with a look of disturbed majesty) â'Twas bravely won; And many a gallant drop hath paid its price: I could have checked my barb in his career, And left my helm unshielded from the foeâ Why say I that I could? I did do thisâ To see thee wrench the banner from his hand. Dread Otho feared thy might; he shunn'd thine eye Here, take this purse! (Hands it to Selim. Selim reaches it to the Soldier, who puts it back calmly and haughtily.) Sol. (Firmly) No! Selim. (Repeating the offer) Nay, take it, take it, Soldier, Sol. (Fiercely) No! boy, I say. (Selim retreats in terrour) Pri. So then (suppressing his indignation) my boon is scorned. Sol. My Prince, I do not sell my blood for gold. Pri. But thou did'st save my lifeâ Sol. (Snatching the purse; then, after a struggle, bowing with an air of bitter sarcasm.) âI saved his life! Its value then, is thisâone purse of gold! One purse of gold! The man, whose life I've saved, Would not play fair if this reward were less. But he's a Prince! Princes have generous hearts; They never pay the market price of blood, Andâthereforeâ Pri. (In amazement) Soldier! Sol. (Tossing it up and catching it, with an air of supreme contempt.) And thereforeâbut enough! I've saved his life. This, this! is my reward. A Soldier's blood Shed for a Prince's life, was shedâfor gold! (Prince agitated) Boy! (Selim advances fearfully) âHere, take this purse; (Selim refuses)âNay, take it, it is thine. Thou'st never saved my life, yet there is gold! Thou'st never torn the banner from the hand Of conquering murderers, in their sudden fight! Grappled with murderers! to protect a prince! (The Prince unsheaths his sword and advances furiously. The Soldier stands unmoved.) To shield his bride! (The Prince falters and returns his sword to the sheath) Yet there is gold! Pri. (Violent emotion) Soldier! thou art too bold;âtoo bold! but brave! And I am pressed to earth with gratitude; And may not lift my handâOh! (pause) Why, what has waked this sudden spirit in thee? For thou art oldâand poor,âhast often fought My father's battles, and his son'sâand yet Hast ever, to this hourâbeen paid with gold. Sol. Not paid my Princeâbut fed. Pri. Well! fed. But these are dangerous looks and tones; Yet, thou art old and brave, hast saved my life. And I must bless thee for the heavy load! (Emotion) The mighty debt! (pause, trembling) Nay, nay, I'm wrongâI bless thee, from my soul! It gave me Alaâ But else,âI do assure thee, for thy words, Thus spoken with that martial irony, I would forget my rankâand draw my blade, And meet theeâfoot to foot!âfor my reply. And this, thou knowest, Soldier. But, enough, I would not touch thy heart, brave man, indeed, With aught of insult or indignity: (Soldier appears moved) For thou art old and poor;âand thy white hairs; And arm still sinewed with the strength of youth, Assure me thou art guarded by high Heaven! Old man! I do assure thee, from my soul, I feel a filial reverence for those hairs! Sol. (Faltering) My Prince! Forgive meâ âI have served thee long, (voice becomes more firm) Have served thy father in his bloodiest march; Will serve thee, tooâforever! 'till my death. For thou art youngâimpetuousâand as fierce As that young Lion that I nursed for war! O, were he living, what a matchless pair! But no! No, no:âand I must cleave to theeâ (suffocating emotion) My PrinceâI ask no pay. But let me see Thy sabre flash! and tall plumes blaze in battle! As I have seen that boy's! and thenâI'll die. (Hesitatingâa sudden thought illuminates his faceâ approaches the Princeâspeaks in a hurried voice, increasing to passionate vehemence.) Yes! I will be repaid! O, give me rank! Enable me to meet dark Ola once, And smite him in his pride! Pri. Ola! Lord Ola? that mysterious man! Sol. Yes, yes my Prince! to meet the Savage once! To rend the mystery that enwraps his heartâ On equal terms! When gallant Lords and Knights May judge our strife like men! Oh, give me this! My smother'd prayer! for daysâand nightsâand years! That till this hour I've breathed but to my God! Pri. (Catching his enthusiasm) Soldier! Sol. (Falling at his feet.) O, give me this! my Prince; For one short hourâthen lay me in my grave! (Rising in an agony of supplication) Or, let me still be trampled in the dustâ By all that nerves the Soldier's arm for war! His self respectâand confidence in Heavenâ Abandoned!âand forever! âO, give me this! Then let the neigh of steeds be heard again! Place thy young bride where I may see her eye! Then let the murderers come! And they shall see The resurrection of a Warriour's soul! Bursting, in tempest, from its self contempt! O, give me this, my Prince! And I will worship thee. Pri. (Shaking with emotion. Soldier has fallen at his feet) âOld man! Thy prayer is heard. (Unsheathes his swordâstretches it over the prostrate soldierâwaves itâflourish of trumpets heard.) âHenceforth, be thou a Knight! Knight Aufred rise! (Soldier rises fiercely; unsheathes his sword, and stands gazing at it.) The lightnings of thine aged eye Would shame the fiercest of our youthful Knights. (Unbuckles his Scymetar and reaches it to the Soldier.) Accept this Swordâ Sol. (Compares their edges and weightâand then returns the Prince's.) No, no, my Prince. This is my oldest friend. I've worn it long. It is a trusty blade. (The eye of the Prince rests on the hill) A humble hiltâbut strong: a keen-edged blade That shall go with me to my bloody grave. It is the first I buckled on my thigh; Has served me well in many a trying hour; And, had I worn it when dishonour smote me, It would have burst its scabbard! Ola! Ola! This shall redeem me if we meet on earth, And thenâwe'll go together to our tomb! Pri. (Awe-struck) Why, what a deadly hate is this of thine! So many years of peace, and battles fought Togetherâside by sideâ: so many deeds Achieved in soldier rivalryâin blood! So many years of smothered flame in thee! For sure, I know the waking of thy wrath, And yet, thou seekest his life. âThat hand, was raised In other days to stretch him on the earth; And yet, he pardoned thee! Sol. He pardoned me! Why, what had he to pardon? I would have dealt him but a Soldier's blow: Would but have stabbed him with a Soldier's blade? Nor this, 'till he had scorned my suppliant prayer; Nor this, 'till I had fallen on my face Upon the naked earthâand begged for death. 'Till he refused me vengeanceâand was safe. O, Ola! Ola! withered be thy heart, To smite a warriour thus! One who had moved in blood, and used his swordâ Curse on his heart! it chokes meâwith a lash! O, we were both unarmed or I had died! I could have shouted, and unwrapped my heart To meet the midnight daggerâbut, a scourge! No, no, I never will forgive him, never! So help me Heaven, in my utmost need! The brand of everlasting slavery, The badge of infamy is on my brain! O, he shall feel what 'tis, to touch a man With other than the weapon of a man. (Enter Messenger.) Messenger. The Duke's arrived. Pri. We'll meet him in the hall. (Soldier waves his sword. Music. An escort suddenly appears and attend the Prince in silence.) ACT II. SCENE I. Night. PrisonâA clouded moon; Otho seen gazing upon it in an attitude of profound contemplation. Clank of fetters heard as he unfolds his arms and stretches his hands towards the skies. No light in the prison. (Enter Keeper and Selim unobserved.) Otho. Farewell! farewell! Selim. (Faintly) Stranger! Otho. Who speaks? Selim. Selim, my Lord. (To the keeper) Guard the doorâ I've seen the prince. Otho. The prince! Selim. No mercyâ Otho. Mercy!â(Advancing)âWho talks to me of mercyâhere!â See you these chains?â(shakes them)âhear you their iron clank? Who bade thee cry to Irman? Who has dared To ask that boy for mercy?âand for me! Did I restore thee to thy home for that? Who sent thee, boy? Selim. My heartâ Otho. Thy heart!âno, noâthou art mistaken, boy; It was a wish to burden mineâ(going to the window) Selim. O, no!â'twas gratitudeâ Otho. (Turning suddenly) Ayeâso it was!â'twas boyish gratitude; This augurs wellâthou hast a noble heart; It could not beat in freedom while in debt. Selim. (Faintly) I do not merit this rebuke, my Lord. Otho. Boy!âboy! I love thee for it. 'Twas no sneer.â There never heaved a noble bosom yet, But felt itself in slaveryâand the worst! When gratitude oppressed it. He who gives, Gives chains;âand he who takes, receives those chains, They ne'er again are equals here on earth. But leave meâI forgive thee, for thy prayers. Farewell, for aye!â May'st thou be happy, boy, And live in slavery!â'tis a boisterous worldâ And greatness, like the tempestâmust be pinioned: Or it will bear destruction in its path, And shake the thrones of earth! (Turns to the window.) Selim. (Attempting to touch his hand) Farewell! farewell! Otho. (Extending his hand in emotion, which Selim catches to his lips) Yes, boy,âfarewell!âI would not now rebuke One heart on earth, that loved me, tho', like thine It crushed my own with kindness. (Selim retires slowly in tears.) Selim. (Without turning) Farewell! Otho. Selim! Selim. My Lord! Otho. Would'st thou atone for this? Selim. (Eagerly) How my lord! Otho. Bear that signet to the princess Alaâ Selim. The princess Ala! Otho. Aye,âif thou hast courageâto the princess! To her aloneâand that, this very night, Though thou should'st seek her in her bridal chamber. Selim. Butâmy Lordâ Otho. Selimâgive me the ringâ Selim. No, noâit shall be doneâthis nightâ Otho. This is her nuptial night!â Selim. It is, my Lordâ Otho. Begone! (Exit Selim.) (Otho, solus.) Can it be possible! Am I the boy That gave such glorious promise in his summer? The hope of princes and of multitudes! Fearless and generous as the lion's whelp: Abandoned to my fate!âBy men I've trainedâ By earth, and heaven! A savage outlawâhere! Ye, who have made me thusâmy father! mother! My destiny on youâon you, abide! My deeds are yoursâand ye must answer them! For I was made for honourable war; And overflowed with gratitude to heaven My heart was full of princely dreams and hopes; The tilting ground, my course,âthe mountain chase My pastime;âand the trumpet's rending voice; All the consuming minstrelsy of war! Were mine!âand all my heart and soul were theirs! Young knights were my companions; and I rode As proud a barb;âa plume that blazed as highâ As bright a harnessâand a blade as redâ As any of my youthful comradesâbutâ âOh, God!âI was a bastard My father!âmother!âYe, who have produced me! I would not curse yeâbutâmy bursting heartâ Ye, in your wantonness have damned your child! My father!âmother!âI arraign ye both! Would I could wake ye from your dreadful sleep! Would I might join ye at the Eternal's bar!â I will!âOh, come!âappear! appear!â Oh, no, no, no! I must be humble firstâmust be resigned; Must bless the foot that tramples me in earthâ Away! away!âI know ye allâaway! I'll to my couch and dream. (Exit to an inner apartment.) SCENE II. âGarden. View of a distant temple. Attendant busy in the illumination. (Enter Selim, looking about, earnestly.) Selim. (To an attendant.) The princess! has she passed? Attendant. Aye, but a moment sinceâto that alcove, (Selim runs eagerly towards it.) The prince is thereâ (Selim retreats.) Selim. (Voices approach.) âHush! hush!â (Enter Duke, Prince, Ala, and Friar.) Duke. What a glorious night! Prince. Well, well, my love; thine eye is brighter now; Thy lip is fresh again;âI'll leave thee here. Duke. Trust her to me, my son; and to thy halls. I'll cheer her for this trying hourâthat seems To press so heavily upon her heart. (Raillery) 'Tis only coquetryâ Ala. (Smiling faintly.) O, no, my Lord! (In a melancholy voice)â'tis something here! (heart) Duke. (Throwing his arm around her waist and attempting to press her cheek. Ala repulses him gently.) Sweet lady, pardon me! Ala. (Recovering, and in a sprightly tone, as the Duke still strugglesârespectfully.) No, no, my princeâit is the son I wed! Duke. (Releasing her.) âSo coy! and yet so young! Well, heaven help my boy! (Selim repeatedly advances and retiresâwith impatience.) Ala. But is it true, my Lord;âis this dark manâ Whose troops have hunted us so long in bloodâ Who never seems to sleepâCan it be true, That he is, now, a willing prisoner here? Duke. 'Tis trueâhe's here, not willingly I think; And yet, 'tis true he broke his blade himself, When he had cloven the helm of my proud boyâ And sprang to earthâand stalked away unarmed! Ala. (Burst of admiration.) And then was taken! (Pause.) And IrmanâOh, had he been taken in arms Had he but conquered him! Strange man!âIt could not be from fearâand yet He fled the soldier's eyeâ Duke. The Soldier! which of them? Ala. The Soldierâhe has served thee longâ Duke. Not that old man!âDread Otho fly from him! O, noâhe would not shun that aged eye; And yet, that eye is terrible in fightâ But terrible as 'tisâit would have quailed Before that withering glance! that beam of blood I've seen his falling like the thunderer's flashâ But Otho would not shun the thunderer's flash, Nor raise his arm, lest it should look like prayer: Like supplication! even to stay the bolt! For he has trained it but for strife and blood. But lady, (Nodding to the Friar and Selim to withdraw âthey obey.) We are all alone; and now, I'll strive to tell thee that my gallant boy, Young, generous, brave, and noble as he is, Has yet one fault. Ala. (Startled) My Lord! Duke. Art thou astonished that he has one fault! Ala. Not so, indeedâI know of oneâhe's rash. Duke. And passionateâ But these are faults that time, And strife and love will every hour reform; Not so with this:âtime will but feed its rootâ And love! that is its sunshine! air and heaven! 'Tis only such as mighty hearts can feelâ And only those, when loving and beloved! Ala. (Alarmed.) Pray what is this?âSuch preparationâ Duke. Madness!âjealousy! Ala. Jealousy!âof me! Duke. O, noâyour female fancies are so swift! Not jealous yetâand may he never be, Of thee, sweet girl!âBut 'tis his mightiest fault: And when it touches him, 'tis madnessâdeath. Ala. (Passionately.) Oh no!âIt is the vice of little mindsâ It cannot dwell in his! He is so full of noble confidence, That dark suspicion in his manly heart Could find no mansionâand no resting place. Duke. A woman's reasoning!âfrom the heartânot headâ And, therefore wrong. A noble nature, child, Not jealous of its prize, must be secure In vanity!âthat brazen panoply! Must bear that potent Ã¦gis to the sun, Whose polished surface but reflects himself! The vain man never trembles when he loves; Is never jealous, He never doubts that he is all the world To that most happy being, he's embraced! He is a cost of mailâ Ala. And noble hearts, then, must be vainâor jealous' Duke. Or else,âindifferentâthen they're safe indeed. Ala. 'Tis said that jealousy is proof of loveâ But, no; it cannot beâ Duke. And yet it is!âThe cold are never jealous; Can never beâfor what have they to fear? But he who loves is oft consumed by thoughts That never thawed the ice of their cold hearts. Ala. (Ferrour) If this be trueâmay I be never loved! O, I should die to meet a loved one's doubt. O, he should beâ So full of confidence and generous faith, That he should joy to prove my loyalty By fiery, trials!âOh, if this be love, May I be never loved! Duke. Nay, Lady, thou hast known what 'tis to love: Hast never trembled with a hateful thought? Started at shadows?â(Ala appears moved) Been oppressed by dreams? (She throws around a glance of terror to the garden.) And pressed thy pillow, prayed and wish'd for morn! Woke unrefreshed? And prayed again for night? Asked confirmation of thy thronging doubts? But yesâI see thou hast! 'twas jealousy! There is no proof of madd'ning love like that: So unequivocal; so past all doubtâ As this consuming jealousy! Ala. But how degrading to the doubted one! Duke. (Solemnity, and emotion) O, think not lady, that I mean the pang, That shoots athwart the brain in living fire, When was suspect the faith of our young wife! O, no! I mean the chilling, dreadful fear, That we are not beloved. I do not mean That watchful spirit racked by looks and wordsâ That broods alone, and preys on insect food, And hunts for guiltânor that which bursts the heart And lightens through the brain! But this, that finds itself deceivedâis muteâ Utters no soundâno wordsâcomplaints or tearsâ But, with his last look on his loved oneâdies! 'Tis the exalted earnestness of men Whose love ennobles all they breathe uponâ But once assailed, they dieâ Ala. Indeed, I cannot think so; for I feel That I could trust my chosen one awayâ Whereâwhenâwith whom it wouldâall free! Duke. And so would he!âSuch is the doubt mean. Alike sublime in confidence and fear. He would not wed an angel till he strove With others for her choiceâand gained a prize Irman would be preferredâand not received Could never love till he had learnt to fear, And both would bloomâand both decay together. âHe loves with all his soul, Would never doubt till thunderstruck with proof. He would not guard his jewel like the man That fears its loss; but, like a blazing crown Would place it on his brow, and bid the world Assay to dim its splendour if they could! Ala. (Enthusiasm) Noble indeed! Such is the heart I love! But this is confidenceânot jealousy. Duke. Well, lady, be it so; it is the power That sways his soul. Ala. O, I could worship him for that! Duke. (Great solemnity) And I would warn thee, should he ever smile A melancholy smile at meeting thee;â Be seeking thee, forever, with his eyesâ Yet turning from thee, when he meets with thine, In tenderness and tears;âif he appear More soothing, hurried, absent in his speechâ Or leave thy couch to seek the morning chase In suddenness and silenceâthen, beware! O, probe his heaving bosom to the quick! He will be dying with some fearful doubt With which his spirit wrestles night and day! And thou can'st save himâ (Music approaching) It is a fearful passion, unsubduedâ But we have talked too longâthat strain Comes blithely on the night wind,âI'll awayâ (Exit Duke.) (The Princess is slowly following him in deep thought, when Selim suddenly appears before her.) Selim. Princessâ Ala. (Starting in terror) Ah!âSelim!â Selim. Forgive me, ladyâhere's a ringâ Ala. A ring! (Examines it, faintly) Who gave it thee?â Selim. The captiveâOthoâ Ala. Otho!âthe rebel chief! (Great agitation.) Who broke his sword AndâHe!âWho would have torn me from my prince? âWhere is he, Selim? (A rustling heard) (Grasping Selim's arm and looking round fearfully) Hush, hush!âis he hereâ Selim. Oh, noâhe's in the dungeonâ Ala. Lead me there! (Hesitation) Selim. I lead thee there!â Ala. (Dignity) YesâI must see that man. Nay waitâand tell the princeâshould he appear, That I am at the chapel: wait me here; And thou shalt guard me to the rebel chief. (Exit Ala) Selim. That dreadful man!âindeed, I fear I'm wrong; But no, I must not speak. (Voice calling, approaches) Attendant. Selim! Selim! (entering) Fly to the prince! Selim. (Trembling) To the prince!â Att. Yesâyes, away. (Exit servant) Selim. (Going reluctantly) What can be want? Yes, yesâhe knows it all,âand yetâperhapsâ No, noâI'll not betray that man! (Exit) SCENE III. âThe prison. Otho seen walking about in great agitation. Feeble light. Otho. No, no, I cannot sleep! Would that ruine hour Of pulseless sleep had come!âthat I might die, And pour my blood out, like a brooding curse, Upon the land that nourished me for death. Oh, Ala, Ala! thou shalt know me yetâ For even thou didst leave me!âThou shalt see That man upon his bloody scaffold yet, Who should have sat, with thee, upon a throne! Would that my father lived!âmother!âall! That I have loved in youth! Oh, they should see And feel the vengeance of the bastard here, When he went forth to deathâ O, Ala! Ala. (A female, cloaked and veiledâapproaches slowly.) Ala. (Hesitating) It is indeed! Art thou that wretched man!â So full of contradictionâgreatnessâcrimeâ (Pause) To saveâand spare a woman in thy power; Then rend her shrieking from her husband's arms! O, man!âman! Otho. Hast thou a husband, lady? Ala. Yesâin the sight of heavenâ Otho. (With great feeling) Yes! yes! thou hast indeed. Ala. And yet, thou would'st have torn me from his arms? Otho. I!âby heavenâ(Stops abruptly) Ala. Ayeâshriekingâfrom the altar!âslay her lord, And sprinkle his young widow with his blood! Otho. (Agony) Woman! (instantly recovers: bitter and sarcastick.) Why, lady; art thou dreaming? Ala. No, no; not now (thoughtfully)âbut I did dream. Otho. And so! the sudden trumpet that ye heard, The planted foot, the war of men, and flash Of whistling blades, encountering, not in sport, When blood was spilt, and gallant hearts were rent, And banners flew! Could but have been for woman! but for thee! True, we were foesâOtho and Irman:âtrue We've sought each other long in deadly hateâ Yetâwhen we meet!âI come to steal his bride! Ala. (Kindling at the sneer) And yet, dark man!âthou would'st have stolen his bride! Tho' thou repell'st the charge in scornâthou would'st! Thine eye assures me so. I know thee wellâ And Irman knows thee, too! Otho. And soâ Nothing on earth could move me to the deed:â Nothing of hate for rivalry in armsâ Nothing but woman!âI must draw my blade. Not to subdue the princeâbut win his bride! And this thou can'st behoveâOh vanity! Ala. (Passionately) âYes, from my soul, I do! Otho. (Significantly) âLady, this is a solitary spotâ For one so bright to meet an outlaw in!â Away from succourâon her wedding nightâ A desperate man, whose final hour is near,â Who would have torn thee, shriekingâfrom the arms Of thy young husband!â âWoman!âwoman! Who would have sprinkled o'er thy bridal bed With thy young husband's blood! (Ala retreats in terrorâhe steps before her way.) Ala. Nay strangerâ Otho. Ladyâit is a lonely spotâperhaps Thou know'st thy husband is my deadliest foeâ My conqueror!âwill condemn me to a death Of slowâintolerable agonyâ And know'st thou notâI see thou dost, indeed; The fading of thy cheek betrays thy fearâ Ala. (Struggling with her terrorâyet keeping her eye on the door.) Strangerâ'tis false!âI know all this, 'tis trueâ But fear it not!âWert thou unchained and free, I should not fear thee, thenâ Otho. (Gathering up his chains and moving about unencumbered.) I am free lady!â Ala. Ha treachery! Otho. None, ladyânone! nought but the bursting strength Of desperation I have wrenched the links! Ala. Impossible! Otho. I have, I tell theeâWould'st thou see the proof? (Gathers up the chainsâextends his armsâmakes a convulsive effort and they fall from his limbs.) Ala. Merciful heaven! (ReelsâOtho support her âShe repulses himâhaughtily.) Otho. Now, lady, we can hold communion hereâ And hold itâas we pleaseâ Lady, I am no common manâand this (Taking her hand) No common vengeance, now within my powerâ The youthfulâspotless brideâupon the wedding night! Of himâmy deadliest foe!â Ala. (Snatching away her hand) StrangerâI am deceivedâfarewell! (Otho prevails her from reaching the gate.) Otho. Nay, lady, nayâwe do not part so soonâ Thou should'st know more of him who gave himself âTo snatch thee from the altarââand thy lordâ Thou art ungrateful!âthink the price he paid! And not one smile! (Changing his whole manner.) Vengeance is mine!âone wordâthou tremblest now! (A sudden blaze of light illuminates the whole prisonâ Cheerful music heard from a distance. Ala gazes at his countenanceâappears bewildered by some sudden recollectionâand then utters a passionate acclamation.) Ala. No, no!âfor I am not deceived! Otho. You knew the ring? Ala. Yes, Selim told meâor I should have wept, To see thee thus, dark menâin prisonâchainedâ Otho. (Pointing to the links) Not chained! Ala. (Forgetting her terror in a burst of enthusiasm) Thy mighty spirit checked in its career Of stormy liberty!âI've hated thee, And cursed thee for thy deedsâand yet, should weep To see thy stern magnificence in chainsâ (Otho points to the broken links in silence. Light increases ârevelry approaching.) Otho. Thy nuptials, lady? Ala. O yes!âthat music that we hear!âthat lightâ Streaming from yonder halls!âthe horns That spring so freshly on the dancing winds! (Recollects herselfâstops abruptlyâin confusion) Yesâall this revelry is made for me. Otho. (Aside) Ambition! Ala. My ladies waitâthy purpose by the ring? Stranger, that pledge shall be redeemed! Think of me in thy prayersâ(Going) Otho. My prayers! Ala. To-morrow,âthou art freeâ Otho. (Absent) Yes, yesâto-morrow I am freeâand sheâ To-morrow she's another'sâ Ala. Another's! Otho. (Still musing) Yesâanother'sâIrman'sâ(Abruptly) Be sure you love him!â'tis a fearful pledgeâ A youthful soldier's hand when given for ever! 'Tis not the holiday of tournamentsâ Of cavalcades, and gorgeous pageantryâ A summer danceâwhen youthful lovers meet In jewelry and plumes! (Ala listens with breathless attention.) It is the pledge Of everlasting union!âlife and death! For earth and heaven!âin poverty and wo! (Faltering) Disgrace and infamy! The wedded heart Should be the sanctuary of the soul! Its refuge from the storm!âits home!âits heaven! But less than thatâ'tis hell!âthe wintry chill Of everlasting iceâ Ala. (Involuntary exclamation) 'Tis true indeed! Otho. (With a look of struggling triumph) The prince is young and proudâand thou should'st think What 'tis to meet the throbbings of a heart That's prest to thine in faith and truthâfor lifeâ And answer, with the echoes of thine own, Like sepulchres to songs! Ala. (Unconsciously dropping her hand upon his in the intensity of her feeling) O, horrible! Otho. Yet that were heaven!âto the endless pang That thou would'st feel unwakened by its throb; For souls like thine, must ever love or hateâ They're plants that bear no blossomsâbend with fruit Or shrink in ghastly barrennessâand die! Thou Ala! (At the sound of this voice, Ala utters a faint cryâlooks around as if experting some other person to appearâgradually become composed.) Thou can'st love!âand thou would'st hate The man, whose love and faith reproached thy soul, And feel like one awaken'd in her tomb! To find her struggling limbs forever bound! For sepulture in life!âAnd kept from heaven! O, thou would'st curse him, Ala, and forever! Ala. Oh God!âno more! no more! Otho. Hast thou a doubt?âthen never wed the prince! That doubt is deathânay, worse than death to thee Ala. Stranger! (with great dignity) Otho. (Forgetting himself in tenderness) Oh, Ala, Ala! canst thou love the prince! Ala. (In amazement) Who art thou! (Pauseâas endeavouring to recall some long forgotten image.) Strange man!âI ever thee muchâand yet Such wordâ'tis wonderful! But, to thine adjuration, strangerâYes! I do love Irman from my heart and soul! Now answer meâO, tell me, who art thou? For thrice have I encounter'd thee; Thrice have I shaken while I heard thy voice As if I heard one calling from the tomb! And felt while thrilling in thy sullen gaze, As if I breathed in pestilence and death! And yetâcannot avoid thee! (Agitation) And I feel Thou art my evil geniusâ And yet, I cannot flyâThere seems to me A dreadful fascination in thine eyeâ That eye!âthat voice! (increasing emotion and terror) Oh yes, I know full well, Thou art familiar with the darkest deedsâ With a strange feeling of dislike, I've met theeâ Shudder'd and fledâand yet againâwe meet! That voice!âthat eye! O yes! thou bear'st some dreadful spell! Yet spare me!âSpare me! Otho. (Losing his self-possession, and falling at her feet.) Lady!âI adjure thee! âAla! hear my voice! Thou'rt on a dreadful precipiceâOh, fly! (Ala retreats in amazementâOtho rises haughtily) Nay, this is declamationâidle rant N. B. This line to be quoted by the critic if he's a wit O, woman, cans't thou feel? I cannot talk. Ala. O yesâbut thou'rt deceived. 'Tis true I've wept; And wondered at thy desperate fortitude: But I have wonder'd more to see such might Exhausted on such deedsâNay, more, While I have wondered at thy fierce career, Thy midnight stragglersâand thy rebel hordesâ So terrible in glory!âI have dreamt Of theeâdark manâuntil I pray'd and wept! Yes wept!â(Retreating from his extended arms) âAnd yet thou art deceived: For 'twas all done in horrourâas we would, To deprecate the wrath of evil ones.â Do I love Irman!âlove himâOne so young So full of chivalry!âwhose soul bows down In mute idolatry to meâ Oh heaven! may I be worthy of his love! 'Tis all my prayerâ'tis all I wish on earth! Otho. (Starting from a profound reverie) Princessâ'tis said thou'rt proudâand cold, Ala. 'Tis true. Otho. And yetâto meâa strangerâand alone, The secrets of thy soul are all laid here: Ala. Wellâso I am!âand had'st thou prostrate knelt And sued for lifeâas others have for love; Or yielded up my signet with a doubtâ Or shook when conquered and condemned to deathâ I should have spurned theeâ âBut thou art a man; And therefore have I opened all my heart. I feel thee as a being, whose command May not be slighted or evaded here; And I have come to meet theeâthusâalone Far less in courtesy than in obedience. Otho. This is frank. Ala. But I am frank against my will. Otho. Thou surely lov'st him then? Ala. Yesâsurely! Otho. PrincessâLady! (forgets himself again) Ala! Ala. That voice again! in mercy speak! Otho. (Leading her to the light) Now, Lady, let me read thy heartâthy soulâ Now, Lady, mark my wordsâI know thee well! Thou dost not love Irman. Ala. 'Tis false! Otho. (Vehemently) No, no!âI say thou dost not love himâno! A boy with glossy eye!âa stripling knight! With unbruis'd armour, and unsullied crest.â With maiden helmâand swordâand shieldâand lance, The blooming champion of the tilting ground, (Ala appears disturbedâwandering) To tread the lists for Ala! God of heaven! A hand so weak, it cannot rein his steed; Who sinks before the lightning of the strife. Like summer blossoms blasted in their youth: He couch the lance for thee! (Her eyes kindle) Woman! thou wast not fashioned for such fate! Thy spirit is of flame!âshould meet with flame! Oânever!ânever!âthou wert made for man, And thou should'st mate with man! a warriour's bride: Who can walk upright in the battle's storm! Ala. (Seeing his purposeâinstantly awakening to her dangerâand replying with mingled scorn and detestation) And sheathe his dagger in the sleeping heart! A pirate!âmurderer!âHa! Otho. O, think not, lady, that a soul like mine, Could leave the sway of men to crouch to thee! Thou art a lioness! but even thou Art far too tame for me! The woman who would share my rifted heart, Should stand unshaken on the thunder cliff, And laugh upon the tumults pealing round! Should bare her naked bosom to the bolt, And feel in safety there! if I were by! Such she should beâan Angel of the storm! Ala. (Struggling with many feelings) I must be goneâfarewell! Otho. One moment, lady, thou hast loved before! Ala. Never! Otho. Never!âreflectâhath never yet some heart Of kindred flame, blazed forth, encountering thine? Hast never felt a sudden, fiery thrill Along thine arteries?âthen, a bolt of ice! Then felt as if thy struggling heart were grasped By some convulsive hand? thy dizzy brain (increasing vehemence.) Before some flashing eye and nodding plumeâ Ala. (Passionately.) Oh! Otho. Hast never seen a form, and shun'd it, too, When,âcould'st then be unseenâthy soul would hang Forever on its pathâ Ala. (Sadly.) But onceâ Otho. Some melancholyâwild enthusiast? Ala. (Recovering.) Never! Otho. (Suddenly changing to a tone of thrilling energy.) Some youthful spirit, when its airy lightning, Like the young war-horse,âat the trumpet's blast Went flashing!âwild!âandâ Ala. (Passionate vehemence.) Yes! yes! Oh yes! Otho. And felt thy pulses quicken, and thy voice Drop fainting from thy lipâwhen he approached Andâ Ala. Stranger! (Otho struggles to conceal his triumph.) And would'st thou know for whom I felt all this? Otho. (Eagerly.) âAye, lady, ayeâ Ala. Well thenâ(he advances.)âfor gallantâglorious Irman! Otho. Neverâneverânot for him! But tell me, womanâhast thou never felt (emphasisâdeliberate.) Thy freedom shrinkingâfettered as it heard The deep enchantment of some master spirit, And felt its potent workings in thy brain? (Fastening her eye upon him.) Ala. But that was terrour, strangerâ'twas not love.â Otho. 'Twas loveâalmighty love! Ala. Nay, Stranger,âfor I have that feeling now; Have felt it, too, for many a weary dayâ Felt itânay, smile notâfelt it all for thee! (with great calmness) But thou!âno no, I never loved thee yet! Otho. (Aside.) By heaven, I'll probe that bosom to the quick! Lady!âAla! (she turns.)âthou art, indeed, deceived. Give me thy hand. (places it upon his heart.) âThere! Ala, there! Dost thou not feel thy pulse keep time with mine? And answer?âthrob for throb!ânay, lady, speakâ Ala. I dare notâ Otho. (Triumphantly.) Thou dost, indeed read thy downcast eye; Thy swelling lipâand struggling step of pride; Thou art a woman yetâbut can't conceal That thou dost love me! Nay, Alaâstay that glanceâ'tis true by heaven. Thou art incredulous? Well!âI'll convince thee. Now listen.â âOnce I saved thee in the storm, When we were wrapped in foam. I then was young: And other glories lightened from mine eye. You trembled when I placed your sinking head (Ala appears much moved.) Upon my breastâand when you woke at lastâ Unconsciously embraced me!âWhy that blush? 'Twas innocent, as is the first caress When angels meet in heaven! Yet, even then, when I had told thee all, That same bright blush enkindled on thy cheek. In that delirium, girl, thy heart spoke out! Ye are all hypocrites but when ye're mad! (Observing her agitation.) From that bright hour, until we met again, Thy dreams were of the pirate and the stormâ Thy prayers and tearsâ And thenâwhen next we metâit was in blood! You knew me not 'till I revealed myselfâ And then you shudderedâand your sinking heart Shrunk from the red pollution of my touch. (As awakening from an oppressive dream.) Ala. Yes, then I hated thee in truth! Otho. Well, so you didâand yet, we met again! And not by accidentâ Ala. (indignantly.) Who has told you this? Otho. Told me lady!âWho could tell me this! And now, again, we meetâand all, alone. You come to see the hated Otho here! Who would have torn thee shrieking from the arms Of thy young husband! Ala. What mockery is this! Otho. The signet, too, you gave me, proved your hate: Now, tell me lady,âwas it not your prayer, When you bestowed that ringâthat I might live? That you might prove your gratitude?âand Once more, on earthâthe hated man! Ala. Stranger! stranger!âhow am I deceived! I deemed thee one so sternly desolate:â Unshakenâwhen thy retribution came:â On whom Calamity could take no holdâ The monarch wanderer of the foaming deepâ Companion to the spirits of the storm! And then!âI could have fallen before thy path, In prostrate adoration to thy mightâ So inaccessible!âand so sublime! Yet thou art but a manâfarewell! (going) Otho. (Seizing her hand.) Proud dame!â Thou didst adore me?âYes, I know thou didst, And dost, and wiltâuntil thy dying day! Thy hate and fear!âthey're woman's steadiest love. 'Tis woman's natureâwhen she talks of hate, And thinks herself sincereâto feel but love! Her fears outlast ten thousand lives of love! And woman's everlasting fear, is but The pledge of everlasting love! What ye should loveâonce gainedâis thrown wide: Thus hate me, Ala!âI would not be loved, Caress'dâand then forgotten! Ala. Madman!â Otho. (Dropping her hand, and leaving the passage clear.) Farewell!âbut mark my words, Thy heart and soul are mine.âThe first warm kiss That Irman gives thy lips, will wake thee, girl, 'Twill be the seal of agony! Give me the ringâthen, woman, let us partâ I'll wear it for thee, Ala!âto my grave. Ala. (Drawing it reluctantly from her hand.) Well, take it for to-nightâ To-morrow thou art free.â Otho. (With calm contempt) Leave me, womanâleave meâ Go to thy nuptial couch and dream of me. I'll to my grave. Ala. (Struggling with emotion.) âFarewell? (Exit Ala.) (Otho, Solus.) Yesâshe remembers me!âmy voice of youth Hath waked an echo in her faithless heart, That ne'er shall sleep again.â Yes!âAll my nights of agony and toil.â The days I've watched in seeing her unfoldâ My resignation to contempt are all repaid! Allâall! The infamy of birthâthat dreadful curse, My lengthening lifeâthe immortality Of woe, that weigh'd me downâare all forgot! No lists on earth, were open for my lance! No battle roll'd its anthems to my name! No trumpet sang my deeds!âno noble hand Grasped mine in confidenceâon cannon's voice Was e'er to peal a requiem o'er my grave! âBut that is all forgot! My life a scene of one perpetual nightâ With no relief on earthâ With none to watch my corseâto drop the tear Upon my nameless tombâwith no fair sky To greet the Bastard's spirit after death. And wipe away the stain, in mercy, there; Yet that is all forgot! No tear shall drop for me but tears of blood,â Or such as fall from heaven upon the tombs Of men of mightâthat die unknownâand sleep Upon the hills! Ohâheaven!âif I may lift my voice to thee, And not blasphemeânow, let thy lightnings forth! And in the stillness of the coming night, Let thine Archangel speak! (WildnessâSolemnity.) O, I would bearâonce moreâonce more!âon earth That anthem of the skies!âO, I would hear The thunders roll their everlasting base And harps and trumpets ring.â Oâmercy!âmercy!â (Sudden terrour fixing his eye on the dark part of the prison.) O! can I be mad? (Recovering with impressive solemnity.) What art thou! Lead on!âI'll follow theeâlead on I say. (goes out as pursuing something with a stately step.) ACT III. SCENE I. âA Chapel fancifully ornamented with garlandsâfaintly lightedâlarge window opening as a terraceâ view of the garden âlow musicâAla rises from the steps of the altar and stands listening to the Symphony. Ala. Support me, heaven!âwhence has come this doubt? He's conjured up a fear that chills my soul. Irman! dear Irman! would I could feel for thee, As I have felt! when sunshineâraptureâheaven! Came streaming from thine eye. (The strain heard nearerâfaint but cheerful.) How sad the song they choose! (Bursting into tears) Oh, that's no bridal hymn! Kind heavenâin mercy!âCan I be deceived? (deep silence for some moments) I feel oppressedâenthralledâmy bridal hour Comes heavily in its approachâ (recovering) That stranger! did he dare to charge me thus? With meeting himâAnd not by accident. Am I betrayed? (Touches one of the ornaments on the altar and a low symphony is heard as in a distant apartment.) How dark the lowering of his serpent eye! How coolly confident he spoke! That girlâno, noâI must not doubt that girl. (Enter Lais.) Come hither childâhow is thy heart to night? Beats it in cheerfulness to these sweet songs? These tenderâplaintive roundelaysâ Yes, Lais, thou art sadâI pity thee. Lais. (Eagerly) Oh, no, not sad! Ala. Is the Prince impatient? Lais. (Running to the terrace and pointing) Impatient!âLet him answer for himself. He walks as if he thought you long at prayers! See him! how he treads! Ala. Returnâhe may observe thee, childâ Lais. (Significantly) And then may thinkâperhapsâ Ala. Lead Ida hitherâ (Lais gains the door) AhâLais!âStay one momentâ (Lais returns) Lais. My Lady. Ala. I amâI've known thee longâ Lais. (Affectionately) âAh yesâ Ala. Thou wast my favourite in my earliest youth. Hast known my heart and soulâtheir secret springs, (Hurriedly)âNow tell me, Lais, hast thou ever breathed Nayâbe not thus alarmedâI do not doubt thee, But, whence I know notâit comes o'er my heart, That thou art less discreet of lateâ Lais. (Bursting into tears) O lady, lady!âtell me what I've done, O, I have lost my hold! Ala. (Soothingly) Lais! Lais! Lais. O, no, my princess, since that dreadful night When we went all aloneâ(Ala lays her hand on her arm)âThrough yonder woodâ Ala. Hush! (terrour) Lais. That phantomâ Ala. (great terrourâlooking round) âHush, in mercy! We must not speak of that! (trembling) Hast thou been mute? Thou hast not breathed of thatâ Lais. No.âNever! never! Ala. Enoughâand bear it with thee to thy grave, Be still as true, and we will never part, Thereâleave me nowâand tell my gallant Lord That I would be aloneâmust pay my vows.â Lais. My Lady! (pointing to the doorâAla waves to herâshe withdraws) (Enter Prince Irman.) Pri. My love! my bride! Ala. My destined husband! Pri. (Transport) Thy husband Ala! (Offers to embrace her; she repulses him, firmly, but gently.) Ala. Nayânay, my Princeâ Pri. (Evidently pleased.) Nay, Ala, we have loved each other long; But never yet hath my full heart once dared To meet the throb of thineâ âFor I have felt That kisses are the seals of heaven. Ala. O, Heaven!â Pri. And never, never should be given on earth But in the nuptial rites of purity, In undissembled and surrendering loveâ And thenâ Ala. (Disturbed.) Yesâyesâ Pri. (Surprised.) Ala! Ala. (Wandering.) His very tonesâand words! Yesâyes, I do love him! Pri. Love him! Ala. Yesâhim! (Recoveringânodding cheerfully at Irman.) âWith all my heart and soul. Pri. And who would doubt thy love? Ala. Yes who would doubtâO who could doubt my love (Tenderly) And you are quite restored? Pri. Entirelyâthanks to heaven! for my full heart Stooped to that dark dreamâand sudden fight. O let me live, this night! if I must fall, And I shall blush to-morrow, at my fears; But comeâlet's to the banquet, loveâ (Ala appears reluctant.) The guests are all assembledâcome, my love. Ala. Nay, my Prince. Pri. (With chilling stateliness.) Ala! am I deceived? Ala. (with reproachful tenderness) My Lordâthis is no summer dance of ours; And I should be at prayer. It is a fearful pledge; (With increasing earnestness and solemnity) A youthful soldier's hand, when given forever! It is the pledge of everlasting faithâ(trembling) For life and death! oh yes, for earth and heaven! (Shuddering)âYes, yes, his very wordsâ Pri. (In amazementâregarding her with a look of inquiry) Whose words? Ala. HisâOtho'sâ(He drops her hand) Pri. His!âOtho's!â(troubled) Why, what is this! (A pauseâAla recovers her recollection.) O yes!âour dreams! But, be not thus disturbed. These phantoms of an anxious heart, my love, Are only dreadful in the clouds of night. They vanish in the light. They're sullen wings, That dash the glittering foam from rapture's cup, Amid the revelry of deathânot life. They only shake the sleeping brain and hand; In sunshine we can raise the cup and laugh, And drink to spectres that disturbed our sleep! Ala. (Suppressed emotion) My princeâI must to prayersâI do believe, That such an hour as this demands the thought Of sober contemplation, more than death. In deathâbut one is wretchedâor is blest, But here are twoâthyself and meâforever! Let us prepare for thisâaloneâapart. Pri. How sad! This merry wedding call of thine, Would seem the summons for the sheeted pomp, The funeral wail;âand not the song and swell Of thrilling minstrelsy and bounding dance, When youthful hearts keep time in extacy! Thy look is more the melancholy smile Of some sad herald of calamity, Than the bright messenger of sunshineâflowers. It threatens sepultureânot marriage, love! Farewellâthou to thy prayersâand I to meet The courtly trainâmy Alaâall alone, Remember me and speed thy vesper hymn! (Exit Prince.) (Ala, Solus.) His very tones!âthe kiss! so he would say. O, had his infamy but been concealed; I could have gloried in that boy! His very tones!âso he would sayâthe kiss, Is rapture's pledgeâthe holy seal of faith, Reserved for hours of mystery and loveâ In hours of such endearment, as the soul Can never know but once! âSo he would say! The Virgin who would yield her budding lip In idle complaisance, would yield herself If she were not restrainedâAnd so she would! The careless prostitution of the lip Pollutes the soul! and all without excuse! All passionlessâand cold! in sport! O shame! FoolâMadmen! he would sayâto rifle heavenâ To see unmeaning gallantry succeed, Where love had prostrate died in tears and awe! And he was right! The heart that truly loves, Has little left to sigh for from the lip That ripens to the touch of ruffian mirth. And Irman feels the same!âand ye are right! That bastard! Heaven, can this be just in thee, That such a towering form and princely port, Should walk abroad in everlasting shame. (Pauseâgreat agitation.) What can have conjured up his spirit now! (Starting as from a trance.) Do I love Irman?âYes! and I hate thee! Thou boaster tooâas I adore the Princeâ Yes, Irman, I do love theeâ (Enter Ida running eagerly into her arms.) Ida, my love! Ida. O, come, come! (Exeunt.) SCENE II âMagnificent Temple, at a distanceâFountainâCompany in groupes. Thick wood on one side. (Enter Irman, passing thoughtfully towards the wood.) Irman. The evening wears apaceâyet I must waitâ Well, well, 'twill soon be over. (Enters the wood.) (Enter Selimâseeking the Prince.) Selim. Yesâyes, I mustâ (Re-enter Prince Irman, unobserved by Selim.) Ah, no, no, no!âI dare notâmust notâ Pri. Selimâ Selim. (Starting) My Lord! Pri. Hast seen the rebel since? Selim. (Faltering in alarm.) I? my Lord! Yes, my Lordâ Pri. And told him of his doom? Selim. Yes, my Lord. Pri. And did he bear it wellâdid'st mark his eye? His port?âdid he not falter in his tread? (melancholy tone) âNo, no, my Prince. I saw his eyeâ'twas calm, and fixedâand terribleâ (In terrour.) It was a serpent's eye! Pri. (Observing Selim's countenance.) Why boy! that serpent-eye is on thee yetâ Thou wast his prisoner once? Selim. Yes, my Princeâ Pri. And yet he spared thy lifeâ Selim. Ah, yes! I told him I'd a mother and he wept. Pri. He wept! Selim. (Earnestly.) He did indeed! 'twas dark, and he was stern. But I could feel his tearsâand they were hot! And he embraced me tooâand I could feel His heart beat mightilyâand yet he spoke With deep composure. Then I chanced to call Upon my father, in my fearsâand then! He started up, and bade me go in peace! And cheer that father's heartâ Pri. No, no, that man could never weep! He is a savage in his soul. (voice heard calling Selim.) Go Selim, thou art called. (Exit Selim runningâPrince enters the wood.) (Sound of tumultuous cries approaching. Enter guards and attendants shouting the Prince! the Prince! come pass through and others divide as in search.) (Enter Duke from the Temple.) 1st Soldier. Not here! not here! Away! (Enter a second Soldier.) 2d Soldier. 'Twas he! 'twas he! Duke. (Alarmed) Who! What is this! All. The Prince! the Prince! (part go outâothers crowd around the Duke.) Duke. (Passionately.) Silence! Where is the Prince? (Enter a Lord, from the garden.) Lord. Gone to the palace. (points to the wood.) Sol. That way! (rushes into the wood.) (Trumpet heardâroll of drums.) Duke. Why this alarm? (Enter a Soldier, followed by the company in great consternation.) Sol. To arms! to arms. (Rushes throughâDuke draws his sword, pursues him and forces him back.) Stop! or by heaven, I'll cleave ye to the earth! All. O, fly my Lord. (endeavouring to lead him off.) Duke. (Breaking from them.) Silence, this uproar! Are ye mad? (To the Soldier.) Speak! Sol. (Still looking about, regardless of the menacing attitude of the Duke.) They've carried off the Prince! (Breaks away and rushes out.) Duke. (Passionate vehemence.) Who? When? Come back! I say. (pursues himâstops.) And he has gone!â (Company crowd around himâenter Servants and Soldiers from their search. The Duke suddenly catches one by the throat.) Duke. Speak, rascal! Where's the Prince? All. He's gone!âhe's gone!âthe Prince! the Prince! Duke. Silenceâsilence! (to the soldier) What is this! Sol. (Struggling) He's gone my Lord. Duke. (Loosing his hold in an agony of terrour.) My son! (Recovers, and raises his trembling hands to the soldier.) In mercy, speak! O tell me where he is! Men! ye will drive me madâ Sol. I heard his criesâ (Re-enter Guard, as in despair.) Guard. 'Twas beâindeed, I thought I knew his voiceâ Duke. O, speakâor ye will break my heartâ Sol. Two mounted ruffians galloped past the wood. Dragging a struggling man alongâ 1st Gua. I heard his criesâ 2d Gua. And IâI knew his voiceâ (Duke staggersârecoversâspeaks in a tone of stifled agony.) Duke. Speed to the palace!âman the Castle walls! And guard the prisoners. (Trumpet) Meet me in the court! (Ala rushes in with dishevelled hair, and throws herself at the feet of the Duke.) Ala. O, save him! save him! Duke. By heaven I will! Away! away. (Soldiers exit.) (Attempting to support her.) Let's to the hall, my love. Be not alarmedâthey cannot bear him far. Ala. Oh, no! butâmercy! mercy! (faints) Duke. No, no they dare not (Observing her to be insensible.) âHeaven! and I'm alone. They'll spare his lifeâlook upâthey'll spare his life! And hold him as a hostage for their chief. (Enter several Ruffians who surround the Duke in silence as he is endeavouring to support the Princess.) Achmet. Lead us to the Prince! Duke. (With great majestyâlooking calmly around on their number, resting Ala on a bank and stretching forth his sword to protect herâas she opens her eyes.) Hear that!âhear that my loveâthe Prince is safe! (She rises and leans against the treeâone of the ruffians makes a cut at the Duke.) Ach. For shame! can ye be men? Look there! Leave that old manâ (Trumpetâshoutsâenter Irman followed by his guards.) Pri. (Rushing forward with his sword drawn.) Forward! forward! cut the ruffians down. (Fights with Achmet.) Ala. My Prince! Oh, God! (Ala sinks to the earthâDuke rushes to support his son.) Ach. The Prince! the Prince! (turning upon him) Ruffians. Aye! Aye! (All attack the Princeâlights extinguishedâshrill whistle heardâothers arriveâthe Prince is borne off.) Pri. (As they bear him off) Father! guard my Ala! (Ala falls at the feet of Achmet.) Ala. Mercy! Mercy! Ach. Away! we want no women hereâawayâ (Ruffians exeunt.) Duke. Look up, my love, look up! (Reels and sinks by her side. Enter other attendants. Duke suddenly recovering at their approach.) Bear her to the hall! I'll lead ye forthâ (Exeunt omnes.) SCENE III. âPrisonâOtho asleepâThunderâapproaching tumult âclashing of swords is the passagesâOtho wakesâwalks forth into the middle of the apartment, and drops his hand suddenly upon his thigh, as for his scimetar. Otho. God of heaven! (returning slowly to his pallet) Unarmed! unarmed! alive, and yet unarmed! Must I be butchered by a furious mob! Well then, I'll die as I have lived. (Fires himself in an attitude of stern composureâshouts heardâheavy blows at the door.) By heaven, 'tis Achmet's voice! and I am free! (Door burst openâAchmet seen contending with numbers. Otho leaps to his assistance, wrenches a sword from one and drives them before him. Selim rushes in and falls at his feet.) Selim. Save me! save me! Otho. (Stretching his sword over him.) Touch not that boy! (Achmet is overpowered and disarmed, bursts from his guards and throws himself at Otho's feet.) Ach. My chief! Otho. (Half extends his handâstops, and then calmly motions him away.) Nay, art thou not a coward! Ach. Iâa coward! (Looking proudly around upon the guards.) âNo, my chief. Otho. I saw thee fly. Ach. (Furiously) 'Tis false! Otho. (Uplifting his sword as to stretch him at his feetâthen pauses with an expression of undisturbed grandeur.) False!â(Throws down his blade) leave me boyâ Ach. (Falling at his feet in an agony of supplication) O, no! my chief!ânot false!ânot false!âand yet I did not flyâI sought to stay their flightâ Have come to die with thee!â Left living men,âand come to die with thee. Otho. Fool!âmadman! Ach. (Haughtily) Yes, so I am!â(His eye falls on the sword.) But here thy power is done. I will die with thee! (Catching up the sword.) Otho. Put up that sword!â(Achmet reluctantly obeys.) Hast thou a soldier's heart Ach. (Sullenly.) âAye, once I had. Otho. (Relenting.) And did'st thou come to force me from my chains? Ach. I did, my chiefâ Otho. Achmet!âhow durst thou!âwhat were my commands? Ach. (Bewildered.) Indeed I had forgottenâNoâmy chief (Pause.) No, no! I came to die with theeâto die! And not to break thy chains.â Otho. Leave meâleave meâ(All obeyâAchmet dejectedâSelim last.) Selim. (Returningâtrembles) My Lord! Otho. Whence art thou? Selim. I was coming hereâwhen that young warrior, there, Stood suddenly before me!âthen I fledâ He would have slain me. Otho. Be calm! (Takes Selim by the handâhe observes the ring given by Ala to Otho on his finger, âand falls on his knees.) Selim. And thou art free!âThank heaven!âthank heaven! Otho. Free!âArt thou mad, boy? What is this? Selim. (Painting at the ring.) The ring!âPrince Irman's ring! (Otho examines it by the light.) Otho. Prince Irman's ring:â(Aside.) 'Tis not the ring I sent. Selim. Yes, yesâit is my Lord'sâ He gave it to the Princess as his pledge. Oh, had you seen him!âHow his heart ran o'er! Surelyâwhyâ(Looking up in alarmâchanging to sudden confidence.) O, noâthe Prince cannot be thus betrayed! It is a passport through the realm!â (Pause.) O, do not wrong the Princess, mighty man! (Faintly) She loves thee, tooâ Otho. Boy!â Selim. Indeed she doesâbut do notâon my kneesâ Otho. Thou lovest her? Selim. (Ferrently) Love bet! (Clasping his hands, and looking earnestly at Otho.) O, no, thou wilt notâI am safe! Oh, I had near betrayed thee! Otho. Ha! Selim. Yesâin my fearsâfor thou art but a man, And might play falsely with a woman's heartâ And thenâthe Prince (in horrour)âOhâGod! Otho. He loves her tooâ Selim. O, madly! madly!â (Thunder.) Otho. Ah!â Selim. O, yes; and he would love thee, too, wert thou Less terrible. I've seen him lock his hands, When travellers told him of thy dreadful deeds, And mariners who'd seen thy gallant barque Go bounding o'er the waveâ Otho. Silence!â Selim. No, no, I cannotâhe has wept for thee! And so has she!âO, thou wilt spare her now, I know thou wilt!â(Catching his hand.) âShe has a father too! Otho. (Shaking him off, and retreatingâthen furiously advancing.) Boy!âboy!âAnd dost thou know me then! (Selim fails down in extreme terrour.) Orâ(Pause.)â Who taught thee that? Selim. Heaven taught me thatâit touched thy bosom once! (Otho averts his head and retreats from the light) It does again!âO spare the princess, then! She has a father and a mother tooâ Otho. (Waving his hand) Begone! (Exit Selim slowly) This Ringâthe Prince's Ringâis this designed! No, NoâShe thinks 'tis her's, to be redeemed. Stay! by Heaven! (pause, emotion) No, I'll not be free (heavy thunder) (Re-enter Selim in terrour) Selim. The stormâ'tis fierce and terribleâ O, let me stay with thee! (Burst of thunder and a vivid flash of lightning; Selim sinks on his kneesâOtho remains undisturbed.) (Faintly) What a night! Otho. Bad omens for a nuptial night. (A flash illuminates the prison and shows a figure stealing along the dark part of the apartment.) Selim. Mercy! (covers his face) (Otho rushes to that part of the prison; and returns thoughtfully.) Otho. Again!âvanished!âvanishedâ Selim. (In extreme terrour) What was it! Otho. (Calmly) Nothingâa shadow passing on the wallâ This lightning blinds meâ Selim. (Whispering) There is somethingâthere: there! Otho. (Solemnity) Who goes there! (To Selim.) Leave meâI must be alone. (Suddenly changing his attitude and extending his arm as if it were grouped by something invisibleâand addressing himself in a low voice as to some person at his elbow.) Release my arm! (wrenching it away) that chill! Thy touch is cold to-night. (low voice) No, no,ânot yetâ Selim. Merciful powers! Otho. Nay, leave that child. (suddenly recovering; thunder.) Sad omens, child! Selim. (Gathering confidence from Otho's manner.) The Prince expected them. Otho. Indeed! Selim. He had a dreamâ Otho. He had a dream!âWell, well, what then? Selim. Aye, and the Princess tooâa fearful one. O how she trembled! (thunder.) Otho. (Laying his hand on Selim's heart.) And so dost thouâIs it the dream or storm? Selim. The stormâand yet I felt a deadlier fear When lady Ala told her dreamâ Otho. What was that dreadful dream? Selim. I hardly know, indeedâshe spoke so lowâ So hurriedly and faintâ (Otho musing.) About some fearful being in a woodâ With bloody plumesâ Otho. (Turning suddenly.) What! Selim. Some one that's dead. He wore a bloody plumeâ And bloody mantle. One that she had feared. Otho. (intense earnestness) Well! Selim. She dreamtâ (Observing Otho's fixed eye, he stops.) Otho. Proceed. Selim. She dreamtâthatâfrom the altar she was borne awayâ By that red phantomâhe arose at once! As from the grave. Otho. (Disturbed.) Now leave me, boyâOr I shall have such dreams. By Heaven, 'tis done! (Exit Selim.) âShe dreams of crimson plumes! And crimson robes! (Re-enter Selim followed by Ala who falls prostrate at the feet of Otho. Selim staggers to the wall and hides his face.) Ala. O save him!âsave him! Selim. The Princess! (Joins in the supplication as involuntarily.) O, save him! save him! Otho. Ala! in mercy! rise. Ala. No, no I'll never rise! O, save my Lord! Otho. Thy Lord! Ala. Irman! dread manâO, save him! for thou can'st, (Seizing his handâhe struggles.) And wiltâI know thou wilt! for thou art great! Otho. (Disturbed.) Rise, ladyâriseâthy Lord? pray, who is he? Ala. Irmanâ'tis IrmanâO, thy bloody bandâ (Selim rushes out.) Otho. (Starting back and locking his hands wildly.) 'Tis done! 'tis done! I knew the bolt would fall. Some of my band were menâhis hour had come! And has he fallen, indeed! Ala. O, save him! save him! Otho. What! has he not fallen? Ala. O, man, we cannot tell! they've borne him off! Otho. (pause) Then is he safe! O, Ala he is safe! To thee, he owes his lifeâ Ala. O, blessings on thy head! thy band is free! Thou and thy band this hour! Otho. (With a melancholy smile.) No, Alaâbut to-morrow I am free. My troops may be to-night. YesâI will save thy Lordâ âThou know'st me, Ala, Wilt thou trust my word? Ala. Trust thee!âthy word!âI'd trust my soul so thee! (To the keeper and guard.) Release the prisoners. Guard them thro' the wood. (To Otho.)âIt is doneâ (Guards wheel to march outâOtho waves them back.) Otho. Nay, soldiersâthat is not my purpose now. I want but fewâmy chosen onesâbut few. Bring that young stripling here. Keeper. Lead the madman here!â(to guards who obey) Otho. Who did this deed? Ala. 'Twas a young warriorâwith a naked armâ (Enter Achmet in chainsâfollowed by guards.) (Starting)âA prisoner too! (looking at Achmet) Otho. Why, how is this? in chains! Cans't thou exist in chains? Burst them! and come forthâCome forth! (Achmet makes a convulsive but ineffectual effort.) Ala. Strike off his fetters! Otho. To fetter him!âO, I could bear it willâ For I am oldâbut were I young like him I should have died!â And left my body in the tyrant's links It could not burstâMy spirit should be free, In spite of chainsâ(Reading the menacles while the Keeper strikes off the fetters) Achmet! come forth!â Who bore away the Prince? Ala. Himself!âI saw him head the band. Otho. (Sternly) Is he safe? Ach. Unharmed. Otho. But why not tell me of the deed beforeâ Ach. IndeedâI know notâ'twas forgottenâIâ I was called a coward! Otho. (Convulsively grasping his hand) Thou'rt a gallant boy!âI've wronged theeâthere! Goâthou art free. Ach. And is my chief. Otho. He never will be free. Ach. (fiercely) Nor I!âby heaven! Otho. BoyâI command theeâgoâ Ach. (Passionatelyâinterrupting him) âNo, no, my chief! I will notâcannot goâ Otho. Boy, boyâthou'st heard me twiceâbegone! Ach. (Dropping on his knee) âMy chief! Otho. Leave me, foreverâAchmetâ Must I be baited hereâand mocked by thee! Achmetâby thee!âby thee, my chosen one! O God! Oh, God!âhow have I fallen! Ach. (Rising and staggering) 'Tis over! I had hopedâmy chiefâmy chief! I will obeyâOh, God! Ala. Amazement!âAh, are these thy men! Otho. Go choose thy menâpursue thyself the band, That bear the Prince. And bring him back this night. And, mark meâbring him safeâSpare not their blood, If they resistâAway! (Achmet going) Send back thy men to prisonâthou art free. Achmet. What have! I done my prince!âLet them be free! Otho. (Sternly) Again!âSend them back to prison. (Exit Achmet) Keep. (Sneeringly) âAye, send them back to prison! Otho. (fiercely) Begoneâ(Exit Keeper) Ala. Will they return? Otho. Yesâevery man of them. Thy husband lady will be safeâto nightâ A few short hoursâwill give him to thy arms. Ala. Bless thee! bless thee! Otho. (Sternly) Woman!â(tenderly)âAlaâleave me. I must prepare for deathâfarewell! Ala. No, not for deathâfarewell, thou wondrous manâ Whom we may love, while we are chilled with awe. Otho. Leave me, womanâthou'rt not in safety here. Ala. I, not in safety here!âwith thee!âO, yes! (Exit Ala) Otho. (Reckoning to the Keeper who advances) Yes, yesâshe does!âLet me not be disturbed (To Keeper) 'Till Achmet comes. (Keeper Exit) But one more trial!âI am satisfied! (Otho Exit) ACT IV. SCENE I. Magnificent hallâbustleâSoldiersâAttendants rushing in, in disorder. Duke walking. Attendants. Huzza! huzza! (Enter Prince Irman.) All. The Prince! the Prince!âhuzza! huzza! Duke. My son!âMy son! Ala. (Throwing herself into his arms) I knew thou would'st be saved! Selim. Yes, yesâI knew he would. Irman. (To Ala) âNo, noâthou could'st not know it, love. Ala. (Enthusiasm) âYes, yesâI did! He rules the tempest!âdeath is on his word! Pri. He!âwho? Ala. Otho! Otho!â(He shakes her off in silence) Pri. (Significantly) âLady! Lady! Ala. (with reproachful tenderness) âMy Lord! Duke. My sonâwho rescued theeâ (Enter a figure in complete armourâfolds his arms and leans against one of the distant pillars in silence.) Ir. A manâ Ala. (Forgetting herself) âYoung! with a naked arm? Ir. No, noânot Otho ladyâ Ala. (Hurtâbut unsuspicious) âA band?â Ir. No, noâa manâa single manâalone! But his blade!â'twas like the bolt of heaven! (Observes the man in armour and points to him) Behold him there!â(all turn) Selim. Heavens! 'tis Ola come again! All. Ola! Lord Ola! Duke. (In a low voice) âIs that the man? Ala. (Disappointed tone) âIs that the man? Not saved by Otho thenâ Pri. Again!âAlaâAla!â That spectre is within thy heart, I fear.â Duke. Such mighty villains tread upon our necks, And force us to admire themâ(Significantly to Ala.) Ala. (Hurriedly) âPrince Irman!âNo, my Lordâ (Emotionâstruggling with her feelings.) No, no, I cannot stoopâ(Walks aside disturbedâIrman observing her.) Duke. (Looking at Ola) âHis presence throws a chill on all around; My sonâI'd shun such men.âWhence comes he now? Ir. Father, we know notâfrom some distant warâ Some bloody field perhapsâhe lives in strife.â Duke. (Still keeping his eye on Ola.) Butâto-night!â Ir. âWell, fatherâI was borne along By Otho's ruffians at their fiercest speedâ When lo!âa harness rung!âAnd from his barb Lord Ola bounded, with his sword of light! I heard his hollow laughâand I was free! Duke. (Musing.) 'Tis wonderfulâindeedâand gone for yearsâ Ir. Noânot for yearsâa solitary man.â Duke. But does his countenance speak fair, my sonâ See how his dark plumes nod! His martial frame Is shaken by a fearful spiritâtell me, Is his speech dreadful as his laugh?â Ir. That face was never seen! Duke. Not seen!âYou've heard his voice? Only in battleâ'tis a fearful cry! (Ola stalks away.) Duke. (Observing him go out.) My son! how know ye that he be a knight? Some ruffianâor a madmanâor perhapsâ A leader of some neighbouring horde!â (A hollow laughâturns and sees Ola at his elbow.) Heavens! what a voiceâ(half unsheathing his sword) Ala. (Shuddering) 'Tis scarcely humanâ Ir. (Smiling, and courteously saluting Olaâwho nods haughtily.) Be not alarmedâ âHe knows not what we say He has been tempted oft. To make him hear, We wake the trumpetâand the neigh of steedsâ The roll of drumsâthe cannon's bursting pealâ No, no, my fatherâhe's a gallant man And bears a passport from our kingâ (Lord Ola remains in a motionless attitude at his side.) Duke. (Faintlyâturning a look of doubt towards Ola) And never saw his eye?â Pri. Never!ânever!âhe is never seen Except in battleâtournamentsâand days When gallant knights are tilting seriously. (Ola walks away.) He comes to this,âmy weddingâit would seemâ To make our hearts beat lighter when he's gone; Like clouds that hide the sunshine, and go by. Duke. But why indulge him in such pageantry? Pri. In truth I hardly knowâhis rankâhis fameâ The favour of our kingâhis wretchednessâ Duke. Ah!â(Looking after him)âHe has a princely stepâ Ir. Yes, he is wratchedâfor he seeks for deathâ And even death avoids him! (Ola seen again leaning on the pillar.) But Alaâ(Observing himâtaking Ala's hand, and leading her to Ola.) Love,âhere thy thanks are dueâhe rescued me! Ala. Lord Ola!â(bowing with great dignity.) (Ola averts his headânodsâand waves them off.) Strange man!â(Ala joins the Duke and they walk to the rear of the apartmentâhe as expostulating with herâAn attendant entersâbeckons the Princeâ whispers something which throws him into great agitation.) Pri. Enough!âenoughâ(attendant goingâreturns) Delay the priest awhileâbe on thy guardâ And let me knowâObserveâ (Exit attendant.) Just what I feared!â (looking after Ala.) âSuch hearts are caught By such stupendous crimes. The blood that stains Such arms as his, is hidden from the eye In terrible effulgence. (Duke and Ala approach.) Well, wellâlet her be happyâAnd for me! I care not for myselfâ Ala. My prince,âI have a suit before we wedâ Pri. There's time enoughâ(carelessly)âWe shall not wed to-night. Ala. (In proud astonishment.) Prince! Ir. (Bitterly) âNo, no, my loveâ Thou'lt have another night for prayers and dreamsâ And holy meditationâ Duke. Ala!âLadyâO, my son!âmy son! Ir. (Coldly) âFather, this boding night is almost spent: And we (looking at Ala) want more reflection ere we wed; For we may be deceived; (earnestly)âwe may not love. (Observing Ala to tremble.) Be not alarmedâA brighter day will comeâ We'll wed in sunshine, love, and laugh at dreamsâ Duke. (Pointing to Alaâwho supports herself with difficulty.) My son! my son! Ir. (Faltering and approaching her) âThy suitâ (She averts her headâalmost in tearsâturns to goâ and sinks into the arms of the Duke.) Father!âAla!â(catching her from his father's arms) This is thy pillow, love!â No other arms shall clasp thy form, aliveâ Not even a father's!âO, look up, my love! Duke. Leave her to me, my sonâ Ir. (Mournfully) No, father, no!âfor she may dieâ I smote her cruellyâunlike a manâ (Ala opens her eyesâand faintly struggles.) Ala, awake! (bows upon her hands and weeps) Ala, forgive me! (She risesâfaintly repulses him, and attempts is pass out unsupportedâhe gazes for a moment on her faceâsnatches her hand and places it, with a look of intolerable agony, upon his brow.) No, no.âI cannot be deceived! (drops her handâ PauseâAla recoversâhe fastens his eyes upon her again, and, in his earnestness, drops his hand upon her shoulder.) That angel eye!âthose tears!âO, speak to me! In mercy speak to me!âO tell me true! Have I not borne upon thee in my haste? And urged thee to the altar unprepared? Consult thy heartâGo to thy chamber, love, And see if I am dear to thee, indeedâ We must not partâI cannot lose thee nowâ Duke. (In amazement) My son! Ir. Speak to her, father, is she not deceived? Ala!âI adjure theeâby thy hopes of heaven! Consult thy heart again in solitude, And tell me if I'm dear to theeâ Ala. (Mournfully) âI need no solitude to answer that. Butâ Ir. But what! Ala. Prince Irman, thou hast wrong my heartâfarewell! It ne'er was wrung beforeâ (Going.) Ir. (Catching her hands and looking at her wildly) Fatherâlook here!âO, can we be deceived? Look at that eye!âNo, noâit cannot beâ (Transport) Ala, forgive me, I have wrong'd thee, loveâ (Kneeling)âForgive me, Ala!âI am mad with fearsâ Ala. (Melancholy wildness.)â YesâI forgive thee, Princeâbut we must partâ Ir. (Wildly) Part. Alaâpart! Ala. YesâIrmanâI have loved thee muchâtoo much; For thou hast broken my heartâfarewell!â Pri. Never!âby heaven!âO, Alaâthou'rt my bride And shalt be yet the partner of my couch In lifeâand death!â Ala. (Faintly) âHere and hereafter!â Ir. Aye, Ala, yes!âfor sepulture or sleep. Ala, forgive meâI am mad to-nightâ Let not the hasty words of fear outweigh A life, consumed in offices of love! I trembled for myselfâfor theeâI feared I'd hurried thee too much on such a night. Ala, forgive me! (She extends her hand to him) And nowâthy suit, my love?â(Ola re-appears.) Ala. Nay, not to-nightâ Ir. Yes, yesânowâthis very nightâ Ala. Well then, 'twas thisâthou dost not know me yetâ And shall notâtill some brighter hourâ I ask of thee to spare the rebel chief; He is a gallant man! Ir. (Catching the Duke's hand) âFather!âfather! Ala. (Not regarding his emotion) To spare stern Otho's lifeâI owe him muchâ Ir. (Strugglesâvehemently)â I willâ'tis done!âOtho is free!â Ala. (Taking his hand) I knew thou would'stâ Ir. (Disengaging it) âEnough! enough!â (Enter the Soldier equipped as a Knight.) Sol. My Prince, I owe thee muchâA soldier's thanksâ 'Tis saidâbut so!âI dare not hope such thingsâ 'Tis said that Ola has appearedâ (Discovers Olaâunsheathes his swordâand throws himself into an attitude of defiance.) My Prince!âthe spectre has returnedâthank heaven! Aye, there he is!âMy arm is strong againâ I rise from earthâDark Olaâwe shall meet, And meet like menâ (Ola walks away) Ho!âLord Ola! Pri. Madman!âpeace. Sol. Lord Ola!â(Striding fiercely after himâis reaching his hand out to touch himâwhen Ola turns suddenly and stands motionless before him.) Pri. Sir KnightâHo, guards! (Voices heard passing the word âGuards! Guards!â) This unexpected courtesy would seem, An ill return, for thy new blazing arms. Sir Knightâ (Enter Guards.) (Ola turns toward the Prince and Duke with great majesty, and waves them to departâthe Prince is obeying.) Duke. My son!âleave not that aged man alone To Ola's mercyâ Sol. (Without taking his eye from Ola) Oh, leave us!âleave us! Pri. I cannot leave him to such certain fateâ Thy arm is terrible in ageâbut his! 'Tis terrible in youthâ Sol. Fear not for me!âfear not for me! my Princeâ My withered arm is strung with immortality! Pri. He saved my lifeâ (Ola repeats his motion to be left alone.) Sol. And so have I!âI've saved thy life, my Princeâ He wronged me onceâis welcome to my life. Fall one,âor both!âit matters not, to meâ For I shall be at restâ (Ola repeats the signal impatiently.) Duke. Must we leave him then?âGray headed man! Sol. No more!âno moreâwe've met to fightâ (Ola waves his arm again and advances.) Pri. He must be obeyed!âOld man, I'll pray for thee! Olaâbe mercifulâ (Exeunt Prince and Duke.) Sol. (Loudly) âWell, Lord Ola, we have metâfor bloodâ (Ola nods.) And we are equals now!â(Ola raises his hand and shakes his head.) (Bitterly) No, no!âthou'rt right, mysterious man!â I wear a face exposed to heaven and earth.â But thouâenough! (Throwing aside the scabbard.) âNow Ola, let us meetâ Yet ere we strike, let me once hear thy voice. But hear it once! I've never heard it since thy ruffian laugh Proclaimed thy triumph o'er a bursting heart. (Pause.) Dost know me, Lord?âWe never part aliveâ (Ola calmly unsheaths his sword.) What,âno reply!âPerhaps thy ruffian blow Hath humbled me too muchâ Well, be it soâwe now have met for deathâ Andâ(Stamping) here!âI am thy equal, Lord, at least. (They fight. Ola stands on the defenceâThe Soldier attacks warily at first, and maddens to vehemence as he finds himself constantly foiledâand exposes himself.) Sol. (Pausing and striking the earth.) Curse on my arm!âArt thou impalpable! (Renews the fight furiouslyâOla makes his guards with perfect composure.) Sol. Art thou so confident!âWhat deadly skill! Thou dost not fear my swordâLord Ola!âLord! O, do not scorn to strike me!âI'm a man! A soldier too!âI've striven with deathâ In battle by thy side!â I'm not afraid to dieâ(great emotion.)âI'm not so old! My arm is vigorous yetâin mercy, strike! (Attempts to provoke him in his desperation by exposing his heart.) O, strike!âin mercyâtreat me like a man! Dread OlaâWhat a spirit must be thineâ To trample calmly on a soldier's heartâ Before a gallant troop of helms and spears! And there!âO meet me, man!âin mercy meet me! (Ola turns to leave him.) Here is my bosomâStrike!âI'll worship thee! O, give me any vengeanceâbe it death. (Ola is walking awayâthe Soldier rushes upon him, with his uplifted swordâOla turns abruptly and disarms him with a blowâHe grasps at Ola's swordâStruggleâHe is thrown to the earthâOla then throws away his sword, which the Soldier snatches up, and raises, as to cut him downâ Pauses with his arm uplifted before the unshaken grandeur of his foe, who never lifts a finger in defence.) Sol. (Throwing away his sword.) âI cannot strike! (Dropping on his knee, and bowing down his head in awe.) Whoe'er thou art!âdread being, I'm thy slaveâ Thy slave for ever!âSoul and body thine! Whole years have passed, and I have dreamt of thee; I would have stabbed thee once before; but thou Didst calmly wrench the dagger from my hand! And give it back in silence! I've lived whole years in panting for this hour; Whole years I've asked of heaven to let us meet; And then!âfor I have seen thy skill in battleâ I felt that I was sure of death, at leastâ And that were peace! We've met!âOh God,âwe've metâand yet I live! (Increasing agonyârising.) On thee, dread being!âlie this soldier's curse; May'st thou be bowed with infamy! (Ola suddenly puts forth his hands as to avert the prayer.) With infamy!âO, I have touched thee, man! (Ola uplifts his sword.) O strike!âin mercy, strike!â'tis all I ask. O strike!âAnd I'll forgive thee allâ (Ola returns it to its sheath.) Sol. (Unbuckling his harness.) Lie there, dishonoured furniture! Lie there, my baffled weapon! (Throwing down his sword.) âI had hoped To bear thee with me to my homeâto-nightâ But we must part!âfarewell!âI'm now a slaveâ And thou would'st never hang on such a thigh. (Ola remains immoveable.) O, canst thou be a man?âcanst thou enjoy The agony of such a scene as this? The parting of a vet'ran from his blade! O, God!âthat I might pour mine aged blood In expiation here!âwith mine own handâ But noâI dare notâI'm but a slave. (Pause.) âThou art the first that foiled meâI am lowâ Trod to the earthâhave sought thy life in vain.â I have walked proudly in the battle's van;â Have heard my banners floating loud above;â Have heard!âO heaven!âbut that is done;âall done! I am thy slave forever! (Falls prostrateâenter Duke and PrinceâOla goes out on the opposite side with a martial step.) Duke. Lord Ola! Pri. Nay fatherâhe will not reply to theeâ His silence is the grave'sâ (To the soldier.)âArt thou avenged? Sol. (gloomily.) âWe've foughtâand I'm his slaveâ Duke. His slave! Sol. Yes, yes,âhis slave! Never again to wield a gallant blade In honourable strifeâno, never! Here have I met himâhere!âand after years Of preparation, in the ranks of war, I prayed to meet him, once!âmy prayer was heard. We metâand here, on this dark spotâfor deathâ And I have striven with him in my mightâ And he!âhe scarcely deign'd to stretch his arm! And Iâwhose fauchion leaves a path of light, Amid the night of battle!âI, whose blade Hath pass'd thro' ranks of thick opposing helms, When now, I strove with him for life and death, Was calmly foil'd in play! While I put forth my whole collected strength, In desperationâto achieve my wishâ And laid my bosom naked to his bladeâ And sought for deathâhe never deign'd to strike! I would have given my soul to touch his heartâ To touch it once!âbut noâ It might not beâAnd now I am his slave. There is my badge of knighthood! (Throwing it down.) I abjure it all.âThe trumpet and the steed! The morning summons to the bursting strife! The roll of battle!âhonour!âglory!âsame! And now my aged locks shall bow and nod, Whene'er he shakes his plumes, as if the Thunderer spoke. (Exit.) Duke. (shuddering) What a dreadful man! Pri. His sword is lightning:âfather,âgo with me, I'm troubled. (Exeunt.) SCENE II. Front of the prisonâPrince walking before it. Pri. I would not doubt that woman for my soul; And yetâno, no.âShe has a mighty heartâ She will not wrong meâno, I must not doubt; Yet such tremendous proofs come thick upon meâ (Enter Princess veiledâraps at the prison-gate.) Pri (Advancing.) 'Tis true, by heaven!â(retreatingâ and faintly pronouncing her name) âAla! Princess. Mercy!âwhence was that.â (Door is openedâshe enters in terrour) Pri. (Wildly.) âWell!â'tis overâwe have loved for years.â Alone!âat night!âto meet the man of bloodâ Alone!âO, woman!â (Enter Selim.) âHa!âthou'lt go with me, (Strugglingâas Selim sinks before his eye.) No, no, I cannot do itâhe's so youngâ Selim. (Tremblingly.) My noble Prince.â Pri. Boyâtell me all.â Selim. I willâShe loves that man.â Pri. She does?âThe proofâand I'll forgive her all. OâI can pardon love!â Selim. She told him that she pray'd for him, And hated himâandâ Pri. Enough! enough.â Selim. She gave that ring to him.â Pri. The amethyst! Selim. The amethyst. Pri. (Suffocating emotion.) That ring!â O, I could pardon all but that! I do not ask her loveâbut I'm a manâ Am I forgot so soon!â(Furiously.)âby heaven! Selim. O, spare her life!âmy Prince!âShe loves thee tooâ I heard her tell him so.â Pri. Thou didst! Her life!âO, that is safeâunless, like me She can die broken-hearted, when she sees Some loved-one act unworthilyâthat ring! To him!âbut yesterday, I saw her weep, And swear that ring should deck her for the grave. Butâif he has a heart.â âLeave me, Selim.â (Exit Selim.) I'd rather die than find my fears confirmedâ (Strikes the gate.) (Enter Keeper.) Pri. Lead me to Otho's call; Keeper. I dare notâhe's asleep.â Pri. (Struggling with emotion.) Asleep!âor has he company to-night? Keep. None, my Prince.â Pri Death!âmust I be mocked like this! (Striking him) Keep. My Prince! Pri. Speak thenâis Otho now alone? Keep. As I hope for mercyâyes.â Pri. I saw a woman enter hereâ Keep. But she awaits his waking.â Pri. Who is she? Keep. One of lady Ala's women.â Pri. Wretch!â(Flinging him off.) (going.) Keep. O, stay my Prince!âI never saw him thus. Pri. (Turning.) âLead me to his cell.â (Exit, following Keeper.) SCENE III. Otho's Cell. Otho asleep. Achmet watching by his palletâOtho awakes suddenly. Otho. (Sternly.) âWho art thou? Achmet. Achmet, my Lord. Otho. Ah yesâI had forgotten thee. Go to thy restâthy last above the grave.â To-morrow we will dieâtogether! boy.â Ach. (Bowing on his hands.) âAh, yes! Otho. Thou hast a soul that should not stay on earth. Hast thou a father boy? Ach. Only a mother.â Otho. No father!âwhat, no father. (rising.) Ach. He is gone.â Otho. Thou hadst a father then? Ach. (Astonished) âMy chief! Otho (Not regarding him.) âAnd hast a mother yetâthou'rt happy, boyâ For she will weep for theeâ (Taking his hand.) Bear upâbe proudâwe'll die together boyâ And die like warriors too!ânow to thy cell. (Exit Achmet) A woman veil'dâ Alone, at midnightâveil'd.âShe seeks me out. And why?âYoung Ala!âlet her answer that! âIf she should come, I'll shake her memory with my youthful voice, Until she sees the spectre of my youth. I have a fiery trialâIf she's firm When I put forth my strengthâand touch her brain, I'll spare her!âworship her!âbut if she yield, O, God, then let me die! (Enter Princess.) Woman,âart thou come again.âKeeper, ho! (Enter Keeper.) Where were my commands! Keeper. That madmanâ Otho. Achmet!â(Fiercely.) Keep. (Sullenly.) âWell, Achmet, thenâhe told me you had waked. Otho. Begone!â (Exit Keeper.) (Prince entersâobserves Alaâstopsâand passes into the shade unobserved.) Ala. Dark manâI cannot restâI've gained thy life. We meet no more on earthâ OthoâI've come to thank thee for the life Of him I loved.â Otho. Loved! Ala. And do love yetâI've come to thank thee once; And burst the charm that binds meâand departâ 'Tis true thy band did not restore the Prince; But yetâthe deed was wonderful! And thy mysterious agency was there. Iâ (Pause.âEmotion.) I am wretched now,âand thou hast made me so. For now, I have a doubtâwhere doubt is death. Where once my fate was strongâ I come to tell thee thou hast smitten me With deathâa lingering deathâand now, farewell! (going.) Otho. (Great feeling.) Ladyâa momentâthose are my last hoursâ We never meet again.âLet us part friends. Thou to thy nuptial couchâand I to that! Let us part friendsâin peaceâand charity: ForâAlaâthou'lt remember me for years,â And this last hour will comfort thee, for aye, Amid thy desolationâ (Ala much affected.) When thou shalt wake and wonder at thyself,â An awful mystery is o'er thee, Ala! When thou art happyâAlaâand when Iâ No, noâI dare not think of thatâ I'll visit theeâand guard thee in the night. Be ever round thee!âwilt thou think of me? Of him who died for thee?âWho gave his soul, That he might see thee smileâand hear thy voice.â Lady, I tell thee, as a dying manâ That I have loved thee!âthou hast made me thus! (Prince much agitated.) Ala. (Looking round fearfully.) Stranger!â I must not listen to theeâ There is enchantment in thy voice.â Otho. Woman!â Ala. Otho! Otho. Ala, I've thought too high, perhaps, but yetâ Ala!âI think, had I been near thee long, Where we might meet and hear each other's hearts; That I had now been free! A valiant name!âon honour's blazing roll: âAnd Ala,âthou Hadst been the partner of a mighty heart, That beat for glorious deeds! O, Ala, had I seen an eye like thine To brighten or to weep when I went forth To combat for its smile,âa voice like thine, To cheer me on my way,âa heart like thine, To bid me welcome, though we were alone In wretchednessâtho' all the world should frown What might I not have been! Ala!âI could have trodden on that world, And died in silent martyrdom for thee! Then, I had been what woman well might love; But nowâwe've met too late.â âI've loved thee much. Shall love thee, yetânay, ladyâdo not weep.â I have one prayerâbut oneâI'm a man Unus'd to supplicationâcannot begâ But I demand it.â (The Prince emerges from his concealment in great agitation.) To-morrow I shall dieâI am resolvedâ I've nothing left to wish for here on earthâ To-night thou art another's.â (Extending his arms.)âOne last embrace! Ala. Art thou a man!âOne last embrace, from me! Young Irman's bride.â Otho. Thou'lt never be his bride!âI ask of thee But one embraceâone kissâ Ala. (Exullingly.) Farewell, farewell forever!âI am free! O, thou hast stooped indeed.â Otho. (Seizing her hands.) Not yetâone kissâone innocent embrace, Such as thou gav'st me once.â Ala. Oh, neverânever! (Prince raises his hands.) Otho. (Dropping at her feet.) âLady.âLook here! I never knelt before.â I've done with magnanimity on earth; O, do not scorn me!âthou art in my powerâ And I would leave thee hallow'd when I die.â I love thee, Ala; One innocent embraceâand then I'll goâ And leave thee spotless to my rival's arms;â Thou should'st have been my brideânot his.â Thou lov'st me like a husband, even now, And yet, I'll leave thee.â Ala. (Struggling violently.) 'Tis false!â I do not love thee, wretch.â Otho. (Rising) Ladyâthou dostâI swear it by my soul! About to meet its Judgeâthou dost! But one embraceâin innocenceâI ask. 'Twill cheet me in my deathâ(She struggles violently.) âNay, Ala! nay, I'd have it freelyâbut, by heaven, I will! Ala. (Faintly.) âNever! Otho. (Releasing her.) Ladyâthen goâand go in purity! I love thee yet too much for violence: I've battled for thee, onceâhave sav'd thy life Amid a fearful stormâand in those arms And on this bosom bore thy sinking head, All this I've doneâfarewellâ âThou wilt not shed one tear In charity upon my grave. Not one! Upon unhallowed ground my bones will lieâ And know no solitude. The busy tread Of living feet will still disturb my sleep. And thisâfor thee!â Remember thouâthat all he asked of thee To cheer him in the bitterness of death, And pay thy mighty debtâ Was but one innocent embraceâone kiss, Which he had taken had he loved thee less.â And that thou didst refuse himâand he died Deserted even by thee!â Ala. (Faintly.) Otho! (The Prince raises his hands to heaven.) Otho. (Half retreating.) âAla!â Ala. Otho, farewellâa vow withholds me.â Otho. (Passionatelyâaside.) O, I could clasp her to my heart (Prince movesâOtho observes him.) âThe Prince! (aside.) Nay then, I'll be revenged!â Alaâthou knowest me! Ala. YesâOthoâI do know theeâthy great heart Is full of energyâand since that hour When thou didst bear me through the billows safe, My heart hath clung to thee, I know not whyâ I shudder when I hear thy thrilling voice, And yet I love to listen!âfor it seems Like voices that have call'd me in my sleep. And then, that dark imperial eye of thine! I felt familiar with its glance.â Sure I have known thee in some other life! Otho. (Triumphantly.) Thou hast indeed! Ala. (Looking at him a momentâand continuing in a melancholy tone.) I know not whyâbut I'm constrained to speakâ Forgive me heaven!âI'll tell thee from my soul That I would rather share thy stormy fate In peril, wretchedness and solitude,â If I were freeâthan hisânow wilt thou live? Otho. O yes, with that embraceâwithout it, no! So help me heaven! Ala. O make me not thy murderer! (Prince, increasing emotion.) My vow is registered aboveâ Otho. What vow?âwhen made? to whom? Ala. In childhood!âto a boy!â Otho. In childhood!âto a boy! Woman!âart thou withheld by this? Ala. (Passionate enthusiasm.) Withheld by this! Would he were here!âthat boy!âbefore our eyesâ Thou would'st not wonder that I made the vowâ He was a god!âand he was virtuous tooâ O, thou would'st tremble in his youthful gaze, As I now do in thine.âO, Osmyn! Osmyn! Otho (Reeling and clasping his hands in agony.) Ala!â(Faintly.)âAla! Ala. (Catching his hand wildly.) Who called me then. Didst thou not hear a voice! (Pauseâlistening.) My guardian angel fled!â (Bewildered.) Otho. Merciful heaven!âwhat is woman's love?â (Seems her handâshe retreats to the shadeâPrince unsheathes his sword, advances, and then returns to the gloom.) O, thou wilt grant my prayer! Ala. (Faintly repulsing him.) No, never! never! (Otho sees the Prince with his sword drown.) Otho. Nay thenâin desperation! (Ala strugglesâPrince uplifts his swordâOtho presses her to his heartâimprinie a kiss upon her lipsâ releases his hold as horrour-struck, she sinks to the floor, and the Prince rushes out.) Otho. (Standing before her as she recovers.) Ala!â(Starting cry.) Farewell, forever! Ala. (Wildly.) Oh, mercy! mercy, Osmyn!âWhere art thou! (Risesâstaggers,and falls at his feet.) Oh, who art thou! Otho. (Retreating franticly) Away!âaway! My heart is broke.â Oh, woman! woman! ye would yield your souls To those your souls should hate. (Advancing towards her.) O, woman! woman! why not call on heaven! Thy guards were hereâ(low voice)âthe Prince himself was here! I would have spared thee! (retreating.) Ala. (Calmly) The deed is done!âmy heart is broken foreverâ My innocence is goneâmy prideâmy strength.â I feel my Osmyn's curse!âO, this is guilt! O, Osmyn! Osmyn!â(reels.) No arm to save me!ânone!âI fall! I fall! My husband!âIrman! save me! save me! (faints.) (Otho rushes to her supportâgates are thrown openâ guards and Prince enter and form a group around her. Curtain drops.) ACT V. SCENE I. (The Prince aloneâresting upon his naked swordâterrace âclouded moonâchallenging of the sentries heard in echoes along the ramparts. Pri. NoânoâI dare notâ'twere a dastard's act.â This blade was given me to guard my life. But I'll away!âand in the ranks of war Provoke some mighty arm to still my soul. (Stands contemplating his sword.) O, Ala!âAla!âthou hast fallen at last! And fallen to one like him!âwhose hand is red With blood of innocents.â Ev'n thou hast yielded to a ruffian lip! OâAlaâI could bear thy lossâbut not Thy ignominy.âI have loved too much To seek for consolation there.â (rehemence.) O, I had stretched him bleeding at thy feet! If I had heard one murmur from thy heart. But no, no, no! âShe whispered never! And thenâshe yielded! (Enter DukeâPrince sheathes his sword hurriedly.) Duke. My son! âO what disturbs thee thus?â Is all this pageantry to pass awayâ The ending of a day that woke for loveâ And be remembered but as princely sport? Pri. (Folding his armsâcalmâand immoveable.) FatherâI am deceived.â Duke. Deceived! Pri. The princess loves me not.â Duke. Not love thee, boy!âindeed thou art deceived! But Irmanâmark me!âthou'st a dreadful fiend Within thy bosom that consumes thy heart! Pri. (Desperate calmness.) FatherâI have seen that girlâthis nightâ Who has refused my prayers for days and monthsâ Whose holy lip I never dar'd to touchâ This nightâmy fatherâ(wildly)âI have seen that girl Within a ruffian's arms! Duke. (Catching his handâand passing his own over the Prince's brow.) Merciful heaven!â Pri. Aye, and I saw him press her yielding lip! Duke. Saw him! Pri. Saw it, father.â Duke. (Pointing to his record.) And hadst thou that? Pri. (Agony.) Yes, yes! I hadâand rais'd to heaven! And would have slain them bothâ âBut something held my arm And bowed my blade. Duke. Thou could'st not smite him! Pro. Father, I shouldâhad she but shrieked for help, Or even, struggled longâ Duke. (After a deep silence.) This is some dreadful gameâwe are deceivedâ That woman loves thee with her heart and soul. (Suddenly catching his arm.) Speak, Irman!âwould'st thou prove her faith? Pri. (Passionately.) Yes! Duke. Then do thou thisâat onceâlet her come forth. Light up the templeâgo in solitude, Within that sacred place, and ask her hand. If she consents!âmy son, she's true to thee. If she's unworthyâthere, she will refuse. Pri. And if she does refuse my offer'd hand, By heaven; I'll worship her!â (going.) It shall be done! Duke. Nayâstay thou hereâhere let your meeting be.â And go in silence to that holy place. (Exit Duke.) Pri. (Great emotion.) O, what a weary night is this!âThe sun Rose lovely on this dayâand my full heart Heav'd high with exultation and with hopeâ Then came a cloudâa dreamâa battle then, And then a doubtâand thenâthe certainty That I was miserable! (Enter Ale with a feeble stepâmelancholy countenante and disordered dress. She stops and trembles.) Ala!âmy love!âto-morrow I'm away. At the first dawn. (Agitation)âAnd we must wed tonight. Ala. (In dismay) âTo-night!â Pri. Ayeâayeâaloneâin solitudeâthis night. Ala. (Terrour) âIn solitude!âto-night!âNo, never! never! Pri. (Wildly) âO, Ala!âAla! I conjure thee! on thy soul!âdo not refuseâ This is a fearful nightâ Ala. (Overcome with terrour.) O, Irman,âmust we go aloneâaloneâat night! To ask the nuptial benediction of our God! Pri. Nay, tremble notâ(solemnity) Young Ala,âit must be. Ala. (Rising with great majesty) âPrince,âI will go!âI'll go with thee alone (Energyâwildly, but calmly.) We'll cross our hands athwart an opening tombâ And pledge our faith in cemet'riesâto-night! Pri. (Impatientlyâanguish) Ala!âAla!âMercyâ Ala. Yesâlet us go!â(deliriously) Aye, to our nuptial couch! (Bell strikes one, heavily.) The tolling bell shall cheer us on our way! Let's go my Princeâthe flapping banners wave! Come, come my Prince,âThere'll be a sheeted troop To do our bridal honoursâCome! Pri. O God!âO God!âWhat have I done! (Clasps her handsâshe gases upon him with a wondering look, and bursts into tears.) In tears!âOh, ye are welcome to my heart! (Clasps her to his heartâshe recovers.) Pri. (Putting back her hair) âDo'st thou love me, Ala? Ala. (Faintly) âLove thee, Irman!â(recovering) Would thou could'st see my heart! Pri. Then let us wed! Ala. (Inclining her head) Yet ere that hour, I have a tale to tellâ Pri. (Impetuously) âNo, noâI cannot listen to that taleâ Ala. My Prince! Pri. No, noâWe'll to the altar, love; and there One word will tell it all!âOne single word Will be the vindication of thy life! Come Ala, let us go.â Ala. (With solemnity) âWith all my heartâ Pri. One wordâone word will put my heart at rest. (Exit, conducting Ala.) SCENE II. âMidnightâA temple dimly lighted. Friar in his robesâAla and the Prince approach the altar. Friar. (With impressive solemnity.) My children!âat this melancholy hour, When all but spirits are asleepâand all That chills the heart, are wandering in the air, I would avoid this ceremonyâ Pri. (Bowing lowâbut impatiently) Nay Father! (To Ala.)âWe have met for life and death. Ala. (Fervently) For everlasting unionâ(faintly)âlife and death. Pri. And we have none to watch our eyes and lips, But guardian spiritsâand the eye of Him Who reads the heart.â âAla, I've loved thee muchâ Have worshipped thee, in truth.âI love thee yetâ Ala. (Trembling) âAnd why this preparation, Prince! Pri. (Increasing solemnity) Indeed, I cannot tellâa secret awe Comes o'er my spirit like the hand of deathâ The placeâthe hourâ (Ala is sinking) Fri. Rest on me, sweet ladyâ Pri. No, noâon me!âhere in her husband's heart, (Energy)âThis is her pillow!âlet her slumber here! Ala. My Prince!â(Hesitates and covers her face) Pri. (Passionately) Speak! Ala speak! Ala. No, noâI cannot nowâ Pri. (Falling at her feet) âAla! Ala! I adjure theeâBy our earliest love! I call upon thee, with a broken heart! By all we love on earth!âor hope in heaven! Now to redeem thyselfâO speak! (Pauses abruptlyâAppears disturbedâshudderingârises.) Ala, I have doubted theeâI've seen such thingsâ Ala. (Proudly) âAnd durst thou take my handâ And trust me yet? And leave thy doubts to perish as they will? Can'st thou do this? Pri. AlaâI can!âfor (feltering)âif I fail, I dieâ I've seen a withering visionâwith these eyes, And I would swear 'twas life!âand risk my soul, In battles with my sword, to prove it true. Butâthere's my hand!âAnd if thou'lt clasp it now, I'll risk my soul to prove it all a dream! The severish workings of a phrenzied brainâ Ala. (With tears of transport and admiration) O Prince!â Thou hast a noble heart!âO, I must speak! Pri. Nay, Ala, nay,âwe'll to that altar, love, And thereâif thou wilt take this handâO, God! I'll live and die as speechless as the dead! Ala. O, Prince!âthou hast redeemed thyself and me! I reverence thy great heartâMy spirit wakes! And I must tell thee all!âI've wronged thee, Prince! Pri. (Passionate vehemence) Thou'rt innocent, by heaven!âhere! feel my heart! And see if I distrust thee now!âComeâcome! There!âtake my handâ Ala. No,ânot till I have opened all my heartâ Pri. By heaven,âI will not listen to thee!â I have that confidence in thee and thineâ Dear Ala!â(hesitation) Yetâtho' I have seen, this night,â Ala. What, my Prince? (Alarm) Pri. I dreamtâI saw thee in a ruffian's arms. His lip was pressed to thine! Ala. (Sinking to the earth) âOh, God! Pri. Look up, my love! Ala. (Clasping his hands and pressing her lips to them) Irmanâfarewell! Pri. No, no, my love! Ala. O, thou would'st never trust me now! Pri. AlaâI will!âThere, take my hand, my loveâ Redeem thyselfâI know thou'lt not deceive meâ No!âthou would'st never clasp this hand, unless Thy soul were spotlessâworthy of its grasp. Ala. (With great majesty and composure.) Prince,â'tis a noble confidenceâI yield! (Reaches her handâhe clasps it eagerlyâis raising it to his lipsâStops abruptly, and gazes upon her face.) Pri. Ala!âthat ring!â(Faintly) my pledge of love to thee. Ala. (Calmly) âI dare not trust it hereâ(raising her hand) but it is safeâ Pri. Thou hast it then? Ala. I have!âand never will I yield it but with life! (He drops her handâCovers his face, and sinks upon the steps of the altar.) Ala. (Listening) Mysterious heaven!âthat strain! (Approaching the Prince in awe.) I heard it in my dream! (A martial figure in a crimson mantle and plumes, stands unobserved behind the altar.) O, Prince, I dare not lift my eyes! Pri. (Rising with strong emotion.) Be not alarmedâI have forgotten mine. Ala. (Trembling and reaching her hand to the prince, who takes it coldly.) Fatherâthere!âlet me be worthy of his heartâ That I may meet that spectre but in dreams!â (Turningâsees the figure.) O, God! 'tis there!â (Sinks to the earth.) Pri. What art thou! (Unsheathes his sword, lifts it, and stands as if struck with sudden death.) (Fri. Covering his face in his mantle.) O thou, who art the tenant of the tomb! (The figure advances slowly towards the prince, who remains immoveableâdeliberately bears off the princess before the prince recovers.) Pri. (Starting as from a trance.) O, God!âmy dream.âTo arms! to arms! (Rushes outâtumult heardâtrumpetâguards and attendants passâdrum rolledâclashing of swordsâ shrieks.âRe-enter, Ala pursued by the phantom with a reeking swordâfighting as he enters with the Soldier and others. Attend. The Prince! the Prince is slain! (passing through.) Sol. (Assaulting the spectre violently.) What art thou?âmurderer!â Spec. AwayâI shall spill more blood. Sol. (Staggering) That voice!âit rises from the grave! (Death-like silenceâSoldier gazes about in terrourârecoversâ rushes on the phantomâThey fightâSoldier is foiledâthrows down his sword in desperation.) Lie there; lie there!âmy strength has gone, forever! There's nought that walks but may defy my arm! Spec. Ye seek my life. (Throws away his swordâthey advance in terrour.â throws aside his mantle, and reveals a mailed breast.) Now, strike! All. Ola!âOla! (retreating.) Sol. Ola, that dÃ¦mon here! (Enter Duke with a drawn swordârushes upon Ola, followed by several soldiers with uplifted swordsâ Ola turns to the Soldier, and exposes his faceâ Soldier utters a cry of terrour and sinks at his feet.) Ola. (To the Duke, who aims a blow at his head.) Aye, strike, old man!âI slew thy son! And here I am unarmed. (Soldier rushes between them.) Sol. Away! Away!âwhat! slay a man unarmed! Duke. Bear him to death! O Irman! O, my son! (Tumultuous voices.âDuke goes out.) Ola. (Bursting suddenly from the crowd, and speaking with the most determined majesty.) Silence! silence!âLead me to my death! (Louderâadvancingâthey retreat in terrour, keeping their eyes upon him.) Hear ye my voice! (marches slowly out, followed by the guards.) SCENE III. Cemetry; Otho and the Soldier entering it. Banners and trophies hung around. Lamp suspended from the roof. Sol. (Stopping and laying his hand upon the step of tomb.) Kneel there, my lord!âkneel there! That in thy mother's tomb? (Otho obeys in silence Otho. (Calmness.) Where is my father's? Sol. Art thou not disturbed? Otho. Where is my father's tomb? Sol. I dare not tell thee, manâdo there thy prayers. And thenâ (Bending and shaking with terrour.) Prepare thy soul! (Laying his hand on the Soldier's arm with a melancholy gaze.) Otho. But first to thee, old man! my prayers be done: Give me thy handâ(rising) Forgive meâI was madâ Sol. (clasping Otho's hands with fervour) I do forgive thee, from my soul! I lov'd thee onceâand I must love thee stillâ But kneel thee there!âfor there thy mother sleepsâ Otho. My mother here!â(Kneeling and bowing his head upon his hands) Yes!âyes!âand now old man, Thou'lt tell me allâ Sol. (with uncontrollable emotion) Aye all, allâ(laying his hand on Otho's bosom) All!âbut thy great heart will burst. Otho. Soldier, this is a holy placeâa chillâ (Shuddering and covering his face) Sol. Otho! Otho. Thou did'st never see me weep! Sol. (stooping) âNo, never! never!âsince thou wast a boy But thou wilt yet weep bloodâ Otho. Blood!âblood!âha! thou art rightâ(sternly) I shall weep bloodâ Sol. Thou wilt indeed. Otho. (calmly) âI have wept bloodâ(vehemently) Soldier! I am a bastard!âOthers have wept blood! The bastard smote them sleeping!âthis red arm Hath ministered to orphans!â Made others fatherless! Sol. Madman!â(terrour)âThy mother slumber there! Thy voice will startle her from sleep! Such a sounds may call her from her sepulchre! Otho. (Franticly) âLet her come forth! O, mother! mother! come, and see me die! O leave thy tenement for once! Come forth! O, I shall meet thee yet! Come forth and see what thou hast done! (Staggers and falls into the Soldier's arms, who stands horrour-struck, as a female figure slowly emerges from the gloom of a neighbouring recess.) Sol. The lady Ala! Otho. (Recovering) âWoman, begone! Ala. (madly brandishing a dagger) Otho! (strikes at himâhe catches her armâshe wrenches it from himârepeats the blow, which Otho avoids) Here's to my love for thee!â(pursuing him) Who slew my Lord! Otho. Woman!â(she stops with her hand in the air) Dost thou know my voice! Ala. (Dropping the dagger) âThat voice! (Sinking on her knees) O, let me hear that voice, once more! (breathless silence) Hush!â'tis coming nowâthat melancholy voice! I've heard it call me twiceâ (Soldiers seen passing in the shade.) Otho. (Tenderly) âAla! Ala. (Deliriously)â Thrice!âthrice!â'tis done. (Throws herself into Otho's arms.) âAnd I am thine!â Aye, Ormyn, we have metâ(Shaking back her hair wildly and gazing upon him) (Placing her hand upon his brow) We've met at last! What! art thou freshly from thy couch? thou'rt coldâ Terribly cold and chilly. (Shuddering)âWhere are we? In this our bed?âLaying her hand on the marble) âAll coldâ Sol. Lady! Ladyâ(She falls upon Otho's bosom insensible.) Otho. In mercy! (Yielding her to the Soldier.) Bear her off. (Soldier bearing her awayâshe partially recovers.) Ala. O save me!âsave me!âOsmyn, I am lost! They tear me from thee!âOtho, where art thou! O, Irmanâbloody!âbloody! (Exit Soldier bearing her.) Otho. Goneâgone!âall goneâand I am left aloneâ(Looking upwards.)âHa!âwhat art thou! (Pause of suffocating emotion.) I have called thee, mother!â I have no voice that now may wake thy sleepâ Thou may'st not come, perhapsâwe cannot meet! Well thenâI'll listen to thy hollow voice. (Bending low.)âWho was my father? (Listens.) Hush! hush!âshe stirs. (Soldier Re-appears.) Sol. Osmynâkneel there!âForgive thy mother all! She sleeps in bloodâ Otho. (Shuddering. Never! never! Sol. Osmynâthou shalt!âbow down stern man; For her who died for thee. Bow downâforgive thy motherâpray for herâ (Faltering.) And thou shalt know thy father. Otho. (In a terrible voice, catching him by the throat.) Art thouâart thou my father!âHa! Sol. (Struggling, and averting his head.) O, no, my lord. (Otho releases himâSoldier leans on the tomb, and countemplates the working of his countenance in silence.) Otho. O mother!âmother!âLet me hear thy voice! (Pauseâemotion.) Thy child should not disturb thy sleepâOh, no! Forgive me, mother! (Shuddering.) She sleeps in blood! (Overcome.) She died for me!â (Suddenly prostrates himself on the earth.) Mother! mother!âI forgive thee all. (Wildly and hurriedly.) Come, comeâlet's goâI cannot meet her nowâ I feel a palsy in my limbsâmy heart grows cold. Sol. Lord Osmynâhither!ânow give me thy hand. Otho. Whither wouldst thou lead me? Sol. Osmyn! Where thou may'st nerve thine iron heart in vain; Where penitence shall touch it yet. Otho. (Calmly.) Lead me where thou wilt. (Soldier leads him to a recess where a body lies covered with a pall.) Sol. There lies the man that thou hast slain. Otho. (Disturbed.) I wish I had not done itâbe was braveâ But he encountered me and fell. Sol. (Shaking.) Place thy hand here! (Raising the pall from the breast.) âHere, Osmyn, if thou darest. Otho. If I dare!âwellâthere! (Laying his hand on the corse.) Sol. That man was thine own brother! Otho. (With desperate calmnessâin a low still tone.) Repeat that sound. Sol. That murdered man was thine own brother! Otho. Enoughâ(folding his arms.) Well!âwell!âmy brother! (abruptly.) Was he a bastard too? Sol. (Terrified at his calmness.) This is terrible! O, OsmynâO, my Prince! O, thou art touched indeed.âI've wrecked thy brain. Otho. (Some dreadful calmness.) Old manâI say, was he a bastard tooâ Was he a bastard? Sol. O, noâ Otho. My father, thenâ(bewildered.)âAm I right?â (eagerly catching his hand.) Sol. The Dukeâ Otho. He is my fatherâleave meâI must see the Dukeâ I would meet my father here! Sol. I will not leave thee!âwould'st thou spill more blood? Otho. (Shuddering) âO, noâ Sol. Then kneel thee by thy mother's tomb again;â And there forgive thy fatherâ Otho. (Kneeling.) Never! never! never!âhe was a manâ (Rising to go.) Sol. Slay not thy father tooâ Otho. (Pouring and shaking.) Slay him!âmy fatherâO, fear not for him.â I would not strike him for my mother's sakeâ Who sleeps in blood! (agony.)âwho died for me! no! no! (Throwing himself upon his brother's body.) My brother!âpardon meâI loved thee much Tho' we were foesâthou had'st a gallant heart. Would I had died, my brother!âby thy hand. Farewell!âfarewell!âthou shalt forgive me yetâ (Shuddering.)âIf e'er we meet again! (Enter Guards searching.) 1st Guard. Seize him!âseize himâthere he stands! 2d Guard. Seize them bothâ (advancing.) Sol. (throwing himself before Otho.) Fly, Osmyn, fly! (An aged Guard rushes forward.) 3d Guard. Osmyn!âlord Osmyn!â(Falling at Otho's feet.)âIt is! It is! Sol. Flyâfly, my lord! 3d Guard. I'll to the Dukeâ Otho. (Air of authority.) StayâI command thee, stay!âPut up thy sword. Old menâye knew me in my prideâmy youthâ Ye've seen me in the war! (Throwing away his sword.) âThere is my sword!â (The Guards advanceâthe two aged Soldiers throw themselves before Otho.) Sol. By heaven, I'll cleave ye to the earthâye boys! 3d Guard. Know ye that man?âIt is your prince! Lord Osmynâ Otho. The Bastard! All. The bastard!âthe bastard!âthe bastard! (Crowding around him with tumultuous enthusiasm.) Otho. The Bastardâayeâput up your swordsâold men. Hear ye my last commandsâand then, awayâ I am lord Osmynâout would meet my death Unknown and unlamentedâhear me, men! The Duke is oldâ(Significantlyâto the Soldier)âhas lost a sonâ To you alone, young menâand theeâand thee I am the bastard Osmyn. To the world I'm OthoâOlaâwho, or what they pleaseâ Breathe not a wordâand let me die unknown. All. We will obey.â Otho. Reach me my sword. (Stretching it forth.) âNow swear ye allâ (All approachâhe waves back the two aged men and advances to the younger ones.) Swear! All. We swearâ (Otho seizes the hands of the two old men.) Otho. (Turning calmly.) âNow then for death. (Exit omnes.) SCENE last. Hall of Justice. Guards. Officers in their robes. Judges. (Enter Duke Alva, lauding a little childâboth in deep mourning.) Judge. Rising and inviting the Duke to a seat on a bench.) My Lord Dukeâ Duke. (Waring his hand with great majesty.) No, no my lordâI'm a petitioner here: I come for justice. Let the man be tried, That slew my sonâand tried in mercy too! I charge him here!â(Pausing.)âLet me see his face. Judge. Bring forth the prisonerâ Duke. Yes, bring him forth!âand let him meet mine eye. (Death-like silenceâEnter Othoâmarches firmly to a position fronting the Duke.) I charge him here, with murderâpiracyâ Rebellion to his King.â (The Judge again invites him to the seat.) No, no my lordsâYe are but menâ I am a father that has lost his son. By youâhis country will pronounce his doom And he will feel it just. But if I speak, 'Twould be a father's vengeance. He would hear Nought but a father's curse. (Embracing his daughter, who stands gazing at Otho.) My child!âmy child!â Otho. (To a guard.) âThat child!âis that his child! Guard. (Looking upon him a moment in silence.) It isâI do not fear to tell thee thatâ Thou wilt not harm that childâ Otho. Bless her! bless her! (One of the company, disguised, approaches, and offers a dagger to Otho unobserved by all but the Judge.) Judge. Ho! treacheryâguards! (The stranger throws off his cloak, and discovers himself to be SelimâSeveral others at the same moment form a rampart before Othoâtumultâstrangers draw their swords.) Otho. (Calmly.) Stand back! stand back! Duke. (Snatching a sword.) âStrike, soldiers, strike! (All prepare for battle.) Otho. Silence! (To the Judge.) Withdraw your menâ Blood will be spilt, elseâ (Judge beckons them off.) Selim!âput up thy sword!â(Selim obeys.)âand (Catches his hand.) farewell!âLead off thy menâ (Selim is marching offâhis band filing after him, when the guards more to intercept them.) Selim,âif they stay theeâstrike them home!â (Selim turns upon them.) There is thy prey!â (Pointing to the Judges.) (Selim advances towards the judgment seatâGuards retreat.) Judge. Let them begone! (Selim leads them off unmolested.) (Pauseârises and addresses Otho with great solemnity.) The bolt of heaven hath fallen!âmysterious manâ (Otho turns calmly upon himâhe appears disconcerted) Who art thou?âWe summon thee as Ola! (PauseâAnother of the judges whispers him.) Otho. Proceed. Judge. Speak, if thou bearest a passport from our king, We have no power against his will. Otho. (Taking a paper from his bosomâtearingâ and scultering it aboutâdeliberately) There lies Lord Ola's passport from his king. Do ye your duty. Let me go to death. Come, lead me forth!âWhat mockery is this? (Surveying the hallâthe judges guardsâand resting has eye on the Duke.) That aged man has lost a sonâ Ye know your duty, Lordsâhe is your Prince. (Turning to depart)âCome, lead me forth! (The guards shrink from him.) Judge. Let him not leave the hall! (The guards approach hurriedlyâhe stops and contemplates them sternly, till they gradually retreat from his eye.) Before we spill thy bloodâ Otho. (Nodding) âThere are certain formsâI know it all, my Lordâ To sanctify the deedâ Judge. We will array thy crimes against thee, man; And thou may'st answer them. (Otho bows assent.) Thou art a murderer! Otho. 'Tis false! Duke. (Clasping his hands and lifting them to heaven in agony.) âO yes, thou art! Otho. Well, be it so, old man. He was thy son, And I can pardon thee. Duke. Yes, dreadful man!âhe was my son. Otho. Well, let me be a murderer thenâWhat next? Judge. A pirateârobberâ Otho. And that is false!âI warred against the world. Can ye be men!âAnd would ye spill my blood, For fighting millions! I am an outlaw tooâWell, be it so. But heroesâwarriours!âthey are outlaws too; Am I a pirate!âThey are pirates, tooâ When they descend upon the foaming deep, And battle for their crowns. I strove for death; That was the diadem I sought in blood! But ye are menânow hear my plea. (Ida leans towards him with the most earnest attention, still clinging to her father, whose eyes are rivetted upon Otho.) Once, I was youngâI panted to be greatâ Then man and I were friendsâI did no crime, Moved high as ever, with as brave a heart; When, lo! the battle raged!âThe thunders came! And heaven arrayed itself against my head! Man hunted me to solitudeâto night! From sunshine to a tombâthe silent place. There I had done no crime, I loved him yetâ And would have died in secrecy.âBut there, He baited me!âHe dragged me forth to light! And then my vengeance fell!âHe slept, in blood! And then I stood and heard the thunders roll And saw the lightnings blaze all wart the skies! I saw the mountain reel! and oaks bow down, In terrible submissionâ âYet I stood! Unshaken in the uproarâundisturbed! That was my birth!âmy spirit was revealed! I felt alone amid a universe! For man and woman were my foes.âAnd HE! HE had forsaken me!âI had no God! (Gathering his whole soul in depth and solemnity.) For I was born a bastard! Duke. (Covering his face) A bastard! mercy! Oh! (Kneeling) Merciful heaven! (Otho steps into the very centre of the assembly.) Otho. But, for my crimesâLet my accusers come. Aye wake them from the tomb! I'll meet them all! If I have slain them they shall hear my plea. I was a bastardâand I had no rights From manâsociety or statesâand I Owed no allegiance on the earth. No laws were made for me. The bastard's rights Are guarded by his sword!âHe owns no lawsâ Enough! Here, in the face of heaven and earth, I call On my accusers to produce their proofs. Who have I slain, but in my own defence? Where are my deeds of blood? As Ola, I was braveâand slew in warâ Licensed by man to slay! Who have I murdered?âI have spilt my blood, For women and for children! (During this speech Ida has been approaching nearer and nearer in her intense earnestness and now almost touches him. The Duke observes her.) Duke. O, fly, my child! (Snatching her up.) âHe slew thy brother! Ida. (Still looking upon Otho and shaking her head.) Oh, noâno, noâ Judge. Thou art a rebel to thy Prince and King. Otho. And that is false. I reverence my Kingâ Andâ(solemnity) have no prince.â 2d Judge. But thou didst crush a soldier's heart. Otho. Did I! and whose? All. The Soldier's! the Soldiers! Otho. Let him appear. (The word passes along. âThe Soldier! the Soldierââ Otho calmly fronting the door.) (Enter the Soldier, appearing as a middle aged man, in a magnificent dress.) Duke. O, God!âO, God! (falling on his face.) (General amazement and dismayâSoldier attempts to support the Dukeâwho shrinks from him in horrour.) âAway!âaway!âBegoneâ (Duke slowly recovers his self-commandâStands andâ but in terrour.) Thou art a fearful apparitionâWhence, Art thou to-night?â(Stranger points downwardsâDuke appears disturbedâwildly.) And thy young wife?âO, heaven!â(faints) (Duke borne off.) Otho. Come, Soldier, comeâgive me thine aged hand! (Soldier grasps it and drops at his feet, with an expression of reverence and affection.) All. At his feet!âthe Soldier there! Judge. Merciful powers! Otho. (Looking around triumphantly) âDid I crush his heart? Judge. But thou didst break a woman's heart. (Re-enter Dukeâlooking about with a troubled air, without seeing the Soldierâwho is hidden by a pillar.) Otho. Did I? And whose? Duke. Man, canst thou ask?âthe wife of him thou'st slain! Otho. Well, bring her forthâGo marshal, bring her forth! And she shall tell ye, if I broke her heart; And slew her husband.â (Exit Marshal.) Duke. But thou didst slay my sonâ Otho. (Losing his stateliness) âThy son!âO God! (Dreadful calmness) His sonâYes, so I did! (Ida, who had again advancedâretreats now.) I was a bastardâthat's my only plea. Do ye not feel it!âAre ye men?âYe must! Think what it is to go abroad in dayâ Day after dayâyear after yearâand live In hopeless solitude!âNight after night Consumed in panting for the unknown bliss Of friendshipâsympathyâand loveâ Nothing to turn to hereâor hope in heavenâ (Ida approaches involuntarilyâgradually relinquishing her hold of the Duke's mantle.) For thereâwe are alone!âand dare not meet A face we knew on earthâ (Ida still approachingâunobservedâAll have their eyes on Otho's countenanceâDuke affected.) This is the curse of bastardy!âthis it is To feel a living desolation in your heart! To have no curses like a mother's smile: To have no father that may hear your prayers But for his deathâ No gallant brother that may share your toilsâ Your perils or your fameâbut infamyâ No wifeâNo sisterâ (Ida timidly reaches up her hand at his side.) âAnd no child! (Observes her)âOh, God! (Kneels and embraces her in agony.) O, bless theeâbless thee, little one! Duke. My child!âmy child!â(Attempts to pluck her from him in terrour as he is searching his bosom for a dagger unobserved by all but Otho.) Otho. Old manâI slew thy sonâ(In a smothered voice) âAnd bold thy child!â We never part alive!â (Folds his arms around her.) 1st Judge. (Rising) âRelease the child! (Officers crowd around) (Enter Ala, leaning on the Soldier. Ida utters a faint shriekâand the Duke stabs Otho to the heart.) Duke. There, murderer, die! Otho. (With a faint laugh) Enough! enough! (Staggers to the feel of the Duke and raises his arms.) âMy father!âbless me!âonceâ Ala. (Throwing herself by his side) I am revenged! O, Osmyn! Osmyn! (Otho dies.) All. Osmyn! Osmyn!â(Curtain begins to descend.) Soldiers. The bastard!âthe bastard! Soldier. (To the Duke who appears stupified) That is thy son!â(distant shoutsâroll of drum.) (Duke extends his handâCatches the Soldier's armâ trumpetârecoversârecognizes himâUtters a cry of horrourâreels.)â (Curtain falls.) END OF OTHO.</field>
