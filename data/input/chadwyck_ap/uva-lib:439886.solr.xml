      <field name="fulltext">PART I. CONTAINING MOST OF THE PLAIN AND EASY TUNES COMMONLY USED IN TIME OF DIVINE WORSHIP. [Young people all, attention give] The following poem is scored for music in the source text. [1] Young people all, attention give, And hear what I shall say; I wish your souls with Christ to live, In everlasting day. Remember you are hast'ning on To death's dark, gloomy shade; Your joys on earth will soon be gone, Your flesh in dust be laid. 2 Death's iron gate you must pass through, Ere long, my dear young friends; With whom then do you think to go, With saints or fiery fiends? Pray meditate before too late, While in a gospel land, Behold King Jesus at the gate, Most lovingly doth stand 3 Young men, how can you turn your face From such a glorious friend; Will you pursue your dang'rous ways? O don't you fear the end? Will you pursue that dang'rous road Which leads to death and hell? Will you refuse all peace with God, With devils for to dwell? 4 Young women too, what will you do, If out of Christ you die? From all God's people you must go, To weep, lament, and cry: Where you the least relief can't find, To mitigate your pain; Your good things all be left behind, Your souls in death remain 5 Young people all, I pray then view The fountain open'd wide; The spring of life open'd for sin, Which flow'd from Jesus' side; There you may drink in endless joy, And reign with Christ your king, In his glad notes your souls employ, And hallelujahs sing. [Come, ye sinners, poor and wretched] The following poem is scored for music in the source text. 1 Come, ye sinners, poor and wretched, Weak and wounded, sick and sore, Jesus ready stands to save you, Full of pity, love, and pow'r. He is able, He is able, He is willing: Doubt no more. 2 Ho! ye thirsty, come and welcome, God's free bounty, glorify; True belief and true repentance, Every grace that brings us nigh, Without money, Without money, Come to Jesus Christ and buy. 2 Let not conscience make you linger, Nor of fitness fondly dream, All the fitness he requireth, Is to feel your need of him; This he gives you; 'Tis the Spirit's rising beam. 4 Come, ye weary, heavy laden, Lost and ruin'd by the fall; If you tarry till you're better, You will never come at all: Not the righteous, Sinners Jesus came to call. 5 View him prostrate in the garden, On the ground your Saviour lies On the bloody tree behold him Hear him cry before he dies— “It is finish'd!” Sinners, will not this suffice? 6 Lo! th' incarnate God ascending, Pleads the merit of his blood; Venture on him, venture wholly, Let no other trust intrude: None but Jesus Can do helpless sinners good. 7 Saints and angels, join'd in concert, Sing the praises of the Lamb; While the blissful seats of heaven Sweetly echo with his name Hallelujah! Sinners here may sing the same [Salvation! O the joyful sound] The following poem is scored for music in the source text. 1 Salvation! O the joyful sound! 'Tis pleasure to our ears; A sovereign balm for every wound, A cordial for our fears 2 Buried in sorrow and in sin, At hell's dark door we lay, But we arise by grace divine, To see a heav'nly day 3 Salvation! let the echo fly The spacious earth around, While all the armies of the sky Conspire to raise the sound. [Thou Man of grief, remember me] The following poem is scored for music in the source text. Thou Man of grief, remember me; Thou never canst thyself forget Thy last expiring agony— Thy fainting pangs and bloody sweat. [To-day, if you will hear his voice] The following poem is scored for music in the source text. To-day, if you will hear his voice, Now is the time to make your choice; Say, will you to Mount Zion go? Say, will you have this Christ, or no? [Come, humble sinner, in whose breast] The following poem is scored for music in the source text. [1] Come, humble sinner, in whose breast A thousand thoughts revolve, Come with your guilt and fear opprest, And make this last resolve. 2 I'll go to Jesus, though my sin Hath like a mountain rose; I know his courts, I'll enter in Whatever may oppose. 3 Prostrate I'll lie before his throne And there my guilt confess, I'll tell him I'm a wretch undone Without his sovereign grace 4 I'll to the gracious King approach, Whose sceptre pardon gives; Perhaps he may command my touch, And then the suppliant lives. 5 Perhaps he may admit my plea, Perhaps will hear my prayer; But if I perish, I will pray, And perish only there 6 I can but perish if I go, I am resolv'd to try; For if I stay away, I know I must for ever die. 7 But if I die with mercy sought, When I the King have tried, This were to die (delightful thought As sinner never died. [O thou who hear'st when sinners cry] The following poem is scored for music in the source text.

Heav'n with the echo shall resound, And all the earth shall hear. 2 Grace first contrived the way To save rebellious man; And all the steps that grace display, Which drew the wondrous plan. 3 Grace first inscribed my name In God's eternal book; 'Twas grace that gave me to the Lamb, Who all my sorrows took. 4 Grace led my roving feet To tread the heavenly road; And new supplies each hour I meet, While pressing on to God. 5 Grace taught my soul to pray, And made my eyes o'erflow; 'Twas grace that kept me to this day, And will not let me go. 6 Grace all the work shall crown, Through everlasting days; It lays in heaven the topmost stone. And well deserves the praise [Did Christ o'er sinner's weep] The following poem is scored for music in the source text. 1. Did Christ o'er sinner's weep? And shall our cheeks be dry? Let floods of penitential grief Burst forth from ev'ry eye. 2. The Son of God in tears, Angels with wonder see, Be thou astonish'd, O my soul! He shed those tears for thee. 3. He went that we might weep, Each sin demands a tear, In heav'n alone no sin is found, And there's no weeping there [Amazing grace! (how sweet the sound)] The following poem is scored for music in the source text. 1 Amazing grace! (how sweet the sound) That saved a wretch like me! I once was lost, but now am found, Was blind, but now I see 2 'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear, And grace my fears relieved: How precious did that grace appear, The hour I first believed! 3 Through many dangers, toils, and snares, I have already come; 'Tis grace has brought me safe thus far, And grace will lead me home. 4 The Lord has promised good to me, His word my hope secures; He will my shield and portion be, As long as life endures. 5 Yes, when this flesh and heart shall fail, And mortal life shall cease, I shall possess, within the veil, A life of joy and peace. 6 The earth shall soon dissolve like snow, The sun forbear to shine; But God, who call'd me here below, Will be for ever mine. [Lord I cannot let thee go] The following poem is scored for music in the source text.

[As on the cross the Saviour hung] The following poem is scored for music in the source text. As on the cross the Saviour hung, And wept, and bled, and died, He pour'd salvation on a wretch, That languish'd at his side. His crimes with inward grief and shame, The penitent confess'd; Then turn'd his dying eyes to Christ, And thus his prayer address'd: ‘Jesus, thou Son and heir of Heav'n! Thou spotless Lamb of God! I see thee bathed in sweat and tears, And welt'ring in thy blood. Yet quickly from these scenes of wo In triumph thou shalt rise; Burst thro' the gloomy shades of death, And shine above the skies “Amid the glories of that world, Dear Saviour, think on me, And in the victories of thy death, Let me a sharer be.” His prayer the dying Jesus hears, And instantly replies, To-day thy parting soul shall be With me in Paradise.’ [Come, we that love the Lord] The following poem is scored for music in the source text.

Must I be carried to the skies On flow'ry beds of ease, While others fought to win the prize, And sailed thro' bloody seas? And sailed thro' bloody seas? 3 Are there no foes for me to face? Must I not stem the flood Is this vile world a friend to grace, To help me on to God? 4 Sure I must fight, if I would reign; Increase my courage, Lord; I'll bear the toil, endure the pain, Supported by thy word. 5 Thy saints in all this glorious war Shall conquer though they die They see the triumph from afar, And seize it with their eye. 6 When that illustrious day shall rise, And all thy armies shine In robes of victory through the skies The glory shall be thine. [Jesus my all to heav'n is gone] The following poem is scored for music in the source text. 1 Jesus my all to heav'n is gone, He whom I fix my hopes upon; His track I see, and I'll pursue The narrow way till him I view Chorus. I'm on my journey home, to the new Jerusalem, So fare you well, I am going home. I'm on my journey home, to the new Jerusalem. 2 The way the holy prophets went; The road that leads from banishment; The King's highway of holiness, I'll go, for all his paths are peace. 3 This is the way I long have sought, And mourn'd because I found it not; My grief a burden long has been, Because I was not saved from sin. 4 The more I strove against its power, I felt its weight and guilt the more; Till late I heard my Saviour say, “Come hither, soul, I am the way.” 5 Lo! glad I come, and thou, blest Lamb, Shalt take me to thee, whose I am; Nothing but sin have I to give, Nothing but love shall I receive. 6 Then will I tell to sinners round, What a dear Saviour I have found I'll point to thy redeeming blood. And say “Behold the way to God!” [How sweet the name of Jesus sounds] The following poem is scored for music in the source text. 1 How sweet the name of Jesus sounds, In a believer's ear; It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds, And drives away his fear. 2 It makes the wounded spirit whole, And calms the troubled breast; 'Tis manna to the hungry soul, And to the weary rest And drives away his fear. It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds, And drives away his fear. And to the weary rest. 'Tis manna to the hungry soul, And to the weary rest. 3 Dear name! the rock on which I build, My shield and hiding-place; My never-failing treasury, fill'd With boundless stores of grace. 4 Jesus! my shepherd, husband, friend, My prophet, priest, and king; My Lord, my life, my way, my end, Accept the praise I bring. 5 Weak is the effort of my heart, And cold my warmest thought; But when I see thee as thou art, I'll praise thee as I ought. 6 Till then I would thy love proclaim With every fleeting breath; And may the music of thy name Refresh my soul in death [Lord, what is man, poor feeble man] The following poem is scored for music in the source text.

[1] Dear friends, farewell, I do you tell, Since you and I must part; I go away, and here you stay, But still we're join'd in heart. Your love to me has been most free, How can I bear to journey where Your conversation sweet; With you I cannot meet! 2 Yet do I find my heart inclined To do my work below: When Christ doth call, I trust I shall Be ready then to go. I leave you all, both great and small, In Christ's encircling arms, Who can you save from the cold grave, And shield you from all harm. 3 I trust you'll pray, both night and day, And keep your garments white, For you and me, that we may be The children of the light. If you die first, anon you must, The will of God be done I hope the Lord will you reward, With an immortal crown 4 If I'm call'd home whilst I am gone, Indulge no tears for me; I hope to sing and praise my King, To all eternity. Millions of years over the spheres Shall pass in sweet repose, While beauty bright unto my sight Thy sacred sweets disclose. 5 I long to go, then farewell wo, My soul will be at rest; No more shall I complain or sigh, But taste the heavenly feast. O may we meet, and be complete, And long together dwell, And serve the Lord with one accord And so, dear friends, farewell. [O Thou in whose presence my soul takes delight] The following poem is scored for music in the source text. [1] O Thou in whose presence my soul takes delight, On whom in affliction I call, My comfort by day and my song in the night, My hope, my salvation, my all. 2 Where dost thou at noontide resort with thy sheep, To feed on the pasture of love? For why in the valley of death should I weep— Alone in the wilderness rove? 3 O why should I wander an alien from thee, Or cry in the desert for bread? My foes would rejoice when my sorrows they see, And smile at the tears I have shed, 4 Ye daughters of Zion, declare, have you seen The Star that on Israel shone; Say if in your tents my Beloved hath been And where with his flock he hath gone. 5 This is my Beloved, his form is divine, His vestments shed odours around; The locks on his head are as grapes on the vine, When autumn with plenty is crown'd. 6 The roses of Sharon, the lilies that grow In vales on the banks of the streams; His cheeks in the beauty of excellence blow, His eye all invitingly beams. 7 His voice, as the sound of a dulcimer sweet, Is heard through the shadow of death, The cedars of Lebanon bow at his feet, The air is perfumed with his breath. 8 His lips as a fountain of righteousness flow, That waters the garden of grace, From which their salvation the gentiles shall know And bask in the smiles of his face. 9 Love sits on his eyelid and scatters delight, Through all the bright mansions on high; Their faces the cherubim veil in his sight, And tremble with fulness of joy. 10 He looks, and ten thousands of angels rejoice, And myriads wait for his word; He speaks, and eternity, fill'd with his voice, Re-echoes the praise of her Lord [Hail the blest morn, see the great Mediator] The following poem is scored for music in the source text. [1] Hail the blest morn, see the great Mediator, Down from the regions of glory descend! Shepherds, go worship the babe in the manger, Lo, for his guard the bright angels attend. Chorus. Brightest and best of the sons of the morning! Dawn on our darkness, and lend us thine aid; Star in the east, the horizon adorning, Guide where our infant Redeemer was laid. 2 Cold on his cradle the dew-drops are shining; Low lies his bed, with the beasts of the stall; Angels adore him, in slumbers reclining, Wise men and shepherds before him do fall. Brightest and best, &amp;c. 3 Say, shall we yield him, in costly devotion, Odours of Eden, and offerings divine, Gems from the mountain, and pearls from the ocean, Myrrh from the forest, and gold from the mine? Brightest and best, &amp;c. 4 Vainly we offer each ample oblation, Vainly with gold we his favour secure, Richer by far is the heart's adoration: Dearer to God are the prayers of the poor Brightest and best, &amp;c.

Then shall my sun in smiles decline And bring a pleasant night.

Hope wakens to vigour and rises to glory; I'll hasten and flee to the promised land, And for refuge lay hold on the hope set before me, Reveal'd in the Bible that lay on the stand. 5 Hail, rising the brightest and best of the morning, The star which has guided my parents safe home; The beam of thy glory, my pathway adorning, Shall scatter the darkness and brighten the gloom. As the old Eastern sages to worship the stranger Did hasten with ecstasy to Canaan's land, I'll bow to adore him, not in a low manger,— He's seen in the Bible that lay on the stand. 6 Though age and misfortune press hard on my feelings, I'll flee to the Bible, and trust in the Lord; Though darkness should cover his merciful dealings, My soul is still cheer'd by his heavenly word. And now from things earthly my soul is removing I soon shall glory with heaven's bright bands, And in rapture of joy be forever adoring The God of the Bible that lay on the stand.

There may we all meet again. [I love my blessed Saviour] The following poem is scored for music in the source text. 1.

My father's house abounds with bread, Whilst I am starving here. 4 I'll go and tell him all I've done, Fall down before his face, Not worthy to be called his son, I'll ask a servant's place. 5 He saw his son returning back, He look'd, he ran, he smiled, And threw his arms around the neck Of his rebellious child. 6 Father, I've sinn'd, but O forgive. And thus the father said; Rejoice, my house! my son's alive, For whom I mourn'd as dead. 7 Now let the fatted calf be slain, Go spread the news abroad, My son was dead, but lives again, Was lost, but now is found. 8 'Tis thus the Lord himself reveals, To call poor sinners home, More than the father's love he feels, And bids the sinner come [Remember, sinful youth, you must die, you must die] The following poem is scored for music in the source text.

Lo, the bridegroom is at hand, Who will kindly treat him? Surely all the waiting bend Will now go forth to meet him. 2 Some, indeed, did wait awhile, And shone without a rival; But they spent their seeming oil Long since the last revival. Many souls who thought they'd light, O, when the scene was closed, Now against the Bridegroom fight, And so they stand opposed. 3 While the wise are passing by, With all their lamps prepared, Give us of your oil, they cry, If any can be spared. Others trimm'd their former snuff, O, is it not amazing! Those conclude they've light enough, And think their lamps are blazing. 4 Foolish virgins! do you think Our Bridegroom's a deceiver? Then may you pass your lives away, And think to sleep for ever; But we by faith do see his face, On whom we have believed; If there's deception in the case, 'Tis you that are deceived. 5 And now the door is open wide, And Caristians are invited, And virgins wise compass the bride, March to the place appointed. Who do you think is now a guest? Yea, listen, carnal lovers, 'Tis those in wedding garments dress'd; They cease from sin for ever. 6 The door is shut, and they within, They're freed from every danger; They reign with Christ, for sinners slain, Who once lay in a manger; They join with saints and angels too In songs of love and favour; Glory, honour, praise and power, To God and Lamb for ever. 7 The foolish virgins are without; The sentence, Go ye cursed— For want of oil they're out—away From Christ they then are forced. No more on earth with saints to join In sharing of my favour; Although you did my children blind, Mourn with the damn'd for ever. 8 Virgins wise, I pray draw near, And listen to your Saviour; He is your friend, you need not fear, O, why not seek his favour? He speaks to you in whispers sweet, In words of consolation: By grace in him you stand complete, He is your great salvation. 9 Dying sinners, will you come, The Saviour now invites you; His bleeding wounds proclaim there's room, Let nothing then affright you— Room for you, and room for me, And room for coming sinners: Salvation pours a living stream For you and all believers. 10 When earth and sea shall be no more, And all their glory perish, When sun and moon shall cease to shine, And stars at midnight languish When Gabriel's trump shall sound aloud, To call the slumb'ring nations, Then, Christians, we shall see our God The God of our salvation.

The promise engages the Lord will provide. 4 His call we obey, like Abram of old, Not knowing our way, but faith makes us bold; For though we are strangers, we have a good guide, And trust, in all dangers, the Lord will provide. 5 When Satan appears to stop up our path, And fill us with fears, we triumph by faith; He cannot take from us, though oft he has tried, This heart-cheering promise, the Lord will provide 6 He tells us we're weak, our hope is in vain; The good that we seek we ne'er shall obtain; But when such suggestions our spirits have plied, This answers all questions, the Lord will provide. 7 No strength of our own, or goodness we claim; Yet since we have known the Saviour's great name, In this our strong tow'r for safety we hide; The Lord is our pow'r, the Lord will provide. 8 When life sinks apace, and death is in view, This word of his grace shall comfort us through: No fearing or doubting with Christ on our side, We hope to die shouting, the Lord will provide. [Come, O thou traveller unknown] The following poem is scored for music in the source text.

But who, I ask thee, who art thou? Tell me thy name, and tell me now. 3 In vain thou strugglest to get free, I never will unloose my hold; Art thou the man who died for me? The secret of thy love unfold: Wrestling, I will not let thee go, Till I thy name, thy nature know. 4 Wilt thou not yet to me reveal Thy new, unutterable name? Tell me, I still beseech thee, tell; To know it now resolved I am: Wrestling, I will not let thee go, Till I thy name, thy nature know. 5 What though my shrinking flesh complain, And murmur to contend so long, I rise superior to my pain; When I am weak, then I am strong!

That rest into which my soul shall then enter, Is perfectly glorious, and never shall end— A rest of exemption from warfare and labour, A rest in the bosom of Jesus, my friend. 4 And more than exemption from fighting and hardship My gracious Redeemer will grant unto me; A portion of bliss he has promised to give me, And true to that promise he surely will be. Yes, I shall receive and always inherit A happy reception and truly divine. For which all the praises and glory, my Saviour Are due unto thee, and shall ever be thine.

Thy hand, in sight of all my foes, Doth still my table spread; My cup with blessings overflows, Thine oil anoints my head. 3. The sure provisions of my God Attend me all my days; O may thy house be mine abode, And all my work be praise! There would I find a settled rest, (While others go and come,) No more a stranger, nor a guest; But like a child at home.

Doth not each pulse with pleasure bound, My Saviour's voice to hear? 4 Hast thou a lamb in all thy flock, I would disdain to feed? Hast thou a foe before whose face I fear thy cause to plead? 5 Would not my ardent spirit vie, With angels round thy throne, To execute thy sacred will, And make thy glory known? 6 Would not my heart pour forth its blood In honour of thy name, And challenge the cold hand of death To damp th' immortal flame! 7 Thou know'st I love thee, dearest Lord But, O!

Along the deck in order, The joyful sailors stand, Crying, “Ho!—here we go To Immanuel's happy land 4 We're now on the wide ocean We bid the world farewell!

On Zion's mount the watchmen cry, “The resurrection's drawing nigh:” Behold, the nations from abroad, Are flocking to the mount of God. 3 The trumpet sounds, both far and nigh; O sinners, turn! why will ye die? How can you spurn the gospel charms? Enlist with Christ, gird on your arms. These are the days that were foretold, In ancient times, by prophets old: They long'd to see this glorious light, But all have died without the sight. 4 The latter days on us have come, And fugitives are flocking home; Behold them crowd the gospel road, All pressing to the mount of God. O yes! and I will join that band, Now here's my heart, and here's my hand With Satan's band no more I'll be, But fight for Christ and liberty. 5 His banner soon will be unfurl'd, And he will come to judge the world; On Zion's mountain we shall stand, In Canaan's fair, celestial land. When sun and moon shall darken'd be, And flames consume the land and sea, When worlds on worlds together blaze, We'll shout, and loud hosannas raise.

My beauty, my wealth, is a sweet peace of mind. 5 That peace! I'll preserve it as pure as 'twas given Shall last in my bosom an earnest of heaven; For virtue and wisdom can warm the cold scene, And sixty can flourish as gay as sixteen. 6 And when I the burden of life shall have borne, And death with his sickle shall cut the ripe corn, Reascend to my God without murmur or sigh, I'll bless the kind summons, and lie down and die.

Accepted my petition, And undertook my case; First gave me sight to view him, For sin my eyes had seal'd; Then bid me look unto him— I look'd, and I was heal'd. 5 A dying, risen Jesus. Seen by the eye of faith, At once from anguish frees us, And saves the soul from death; Come, then, to this Physician, His help he'll freely give; He makes no hard condition, 'Tis only Look and live.

The growing of the corn, The lily and the thorn, The pleasant and forlorn, All declare God is there, In the meadows drest in green, There he's seen. 2 See springs of water rise, Fountains flow, rivers run; The mist below the skies Hides the sun; Then down the rain doth pour The ocean it doth roar, And dash against the shore, All to praise, in their lays, That God that ne'er declines His designs. 3 The sun, to my surprise, Speaks of God as he flies; The comets in their blaze Give him praise; The shining of the stars. The moon as it appears, His sacred name declares; See them shine, all divine! The shades in silence prove God's above. 4 Then let my station be Here on earth, as I see The sacred One in Three All agree; Through all the world is made The forest and the glade; Nor let me be afraid. Though I dwell on the hill, Since nature's works declare God is there. [On Jordan's stormy banks I stand] The following poem is scored for music in the source text.

[O, once I had a glorious view] The following poem is scored for music in the source text. 1 O, once I had a glorious view Of my redeeming Lord; He said, I'll be a God to you, And I believed his word. But now I have a deeper stroke Than all my groanings are; My God has me of late forsook,— He's gone, I know not where. 2 O what immortal joys I felt, On that celestial day, When my hard heart began to melt, By love dissolved away! But my complaint is bitter now, For all my joys are gone; I've stray'd!—I'm left!—I know not how. The light's from the withdrawn. 3 Once I could joy the saints to meet, To me they were most dear; I then could stoop to wash their feet, And shed a joyful tea But now I meet them as the rest, And with them joyless stay; My conversation's spiritless, Or else I've naught to say. 4 I once could mourn o'er dying men, And long'd their souls to win; I travail'd for their poor children, And warn'd them of their sin: But now my heart's so careless grown, Although they're drown'd in vice, My bowels o'er them cease to yearn— My tears have left mine eyes. 5 I forward go in duty's way, But can't perceive him there; Then backwards on the road I stray, But cannot find him there: On the left hand, where he doth work, Among the wicked crew, And on the right, I find him not, Among the favour'd few. 6 What shall I do?—shall I lie down. And sink in deep despair? Will he for ever wear a frown. Nor hear my feeble pray'r? No: he will put his strength in me, He knows the way I've stroll'd And when I'm tried sufficiently. I shall come forth as gold. [Come all, who love my Lord and master] The following poem is scored for music in the source text.

Far as the east from west is parted, So far my sins by's dying love, From me by faith are separated, Blest antepast of joys above. 2 I late estranged from Jesus wander'd, And thought each dang'rous poison good, But he in mercy long pursued me, With cries of his redeeming blood. Though like Bartimeus I was blinded, In nature's darkest night conceal'd, But Jesus' love removed my blindness, And he his pardoning grace reveal'd. 3 Now I will praise him, he spares me, And with his people sing aloud, Though opposed, and sinners mock me, In rapturous songs I'll praise my God. By faith I view the heavenly concert, They sing high strains of Jesus' love O! with desire my soul is longing, And fain would be with Christ above. 4 That blessed day is fast approaching, When Christ in glorious clouds will come, With sounding trumps and shouts of angels To call each faithful spirit home. There's Abraham, Isaac, holy prophets, And all the saints at God's right hand, There hosts of angels join in concert, Shout as they reach the promised land.

O mercy! look down from above. Great Creator, on us, thy sad children, with love; When beneath to their darkness the wicked are driv'n. May our justified souls find a welcome in heav'n.

The time for such trifles with me is now o'er; A country I've found where true joys abound, To dwell I'm determin'd on that happy ground. 2 No mortal doth know what Christ will bestow, What life, strength and comfort! go after him, go! Lo, onward I move, to see Christ above, None guesses how wondrous my journey will prove. 3 Great spoils I shall win, from death, hell, and sin; Midst outward affliction shall feel Christ within; And still, which is best, I in his dear breast, As at the beginning, find pardon and rest. 4 When I am to die, receive me, I'll cry, For Jesus has lov'd me, I cannot tell why; But this I do find, we two are so join'd, He'll not live in glory and leave me behind. 5 This blessing is mine, through favour divine, And O, my dear Jesus, the praise shall be thine In heaven we'll meet in harmony sweet, And, glory to Jesus! we'll then be complete.

When Satan, my foe, comes in like a flood, To drive my poor soul from the fountain of good, I'll pray to the Saviour who kindly did die: “Lead me to the Rock that is higher than I!” Higher than I, Higher than I; Lead me to the Rock that is higher than I! 3. And when I have ended my pilgrimage here, In Jesus' pure righteousness let me appear: From the swellings of Jordan to thee will I cry: “Lead me to the Rock that is higher than I!” 4. And when the last trumpet shall sound through the skies, And the dead from the dust of the earth shall arise, With millions I'll join, far above yonder sky, To praise the Great Rock that is higher than I [Brethren, don't you hear the sound] The following poem is scored for music in the source text. 1 Brethren, don't you hear the sound?

The sick and sore, the blind and lame. The maladies of all are healed, Outlaw'd rebels, too, may claim, And find a pardon freely sealed. 3 The battle is not to the strong, The burden's on our Captain's shoulder; None so aged or so young, But may enlist, and be a soldier: Those who cannot fight nor fly, Beneath his banner find protection: None who on his arm rely Shall be reduced to base subjection. 4 You need not fear;—the cause is good; Come! who will to the crown aspire? In this cause the martyrs bled, Or shouted vict'ry in the fire; In this cause let's follow on, And soon we'll tell the pleasing story, How by faith we gain'd the crown. And fought our way to life and glory. 5 The battle, brethren, is begun, Behold the armies now in motion! Some, by faith, behold the crown, And almost grasp their future portion. Hark! the victory's sounding loud! Immanuel's chariot wheels are rumbling Mourners weeping through the crowd, And Satan's kingdom down is tumbling [Come, little children, now we may] The following poem is scored for music in the source text. [1] Come, little children, now we may Partake a little morsel, For little songs and little ways Adorn'd a great apostle; A little drop of Jesus' blood Can make a feast of union; It is by little steps we move Into a full communion. 2 A little faith does mighty deeds, Quite past all my recounting; Faith, like a little mustard seed, Can move a lofty mountain. A little charity and zeal, A little tribulation, A little patience makes us feel Great peace and consolation. 3 A little cross with cheerfulness, A little self-denial, Will serve to make our troubles less And bear the greatest trial. The Spirit like a little dove On Jesus once descended; To show his meekness and his love The emblem was intended. 4 The title of the little Lamb Unto our Lord was given; Such was our Saviour's little name, The Lord of earth and heaven. A little voice that's small and still Can rule the whole creation; A little stone the earth shall fill, And humble every nation. 5 A little zeal supplies the soul, It doth the heart inspire; A little spark lights up the whole, And sets the crowd on fire. A little union serves to hold The good and tender-hearted; It's stronger than a chain of gold And never can be parted. 6 Come, let us labour here below, And who can be the straitest; For in God's kingdom, all must know The least shall be the greatest. O give us, Lord, a little drop Of heavenly love and union O may we never, never stop Short of a full communion [There is a land of pleasure] The following poem is scored for music in the source text.

Long darkness dwelt around me, With scarcely once a cheering ray, But since my Saviour found me, A lamp has shone along my way. 2 My way is full of danger, But 'tis the path that leads to God; And like a faithful soldier, I'll march along the heavenly road; Now I must gird my sword on, My breastplate, helmet, and my shield, And fight the hosts of Satan Until I reach the heavenly field. 3 I'm on the way to Zion, Still guarded by my Saviour's hand; O, come along, dear sinners, And view Emmanuel's happy land: To all that stay behind me, I bid a long, a sad farewell! O come! or you'll repent it, When you shall reach the gates of hell. 4 The vale of tears surrounds me, And Jordan's current rolls before; O! how I stand and tremble, To hear the dismal waters roar! Whose hand shall then support me, And keep my soul from sinking there From sinking down to darkness, And to the regions of despair! 5 This stream shall not affright me, Although it take me to the grave; If Jesus stand beside me, I'll safely ride on Jordan's wave: His word can calm the ocean, His lamp can cheer the gloomy vale: O may this friend be with me, When through the gates of death I sail! 6 Come, then, thou king of terrors, Thy fatal dart may lay the low; But soon I'll reach those regions Where everlasting pleasures flow: O sinners, I must leave you, And join that bless'd immortal band, No more to stand beside you, Till at the judgment-bar we stand. 7 Soon the archangel's trumpet Shall shake the globe from pole to pole. And all the wheels of nature Shall in a moment cease to roll Then we shall see the Saviour, With shining ranks of angels come, To execute his vengeance, And take his ransom'd people home [Come, thou fount of ev'ry blessing] The following poem is scored for music in the source text.

[1] The watchmen blow the trumpet round, Come, listen to the solemn sound, And be assured there's danger nigh; How many are prepared to die? Your days on earth will soon be o'er, And time to you return no more; O think thou hast a soul to save; What are thy hopes beyond the grave? 2 Come, old and young; come, rich and poor; You'll all be call'd to stand before The God that made the earth and sea, And there proclaim his majesty. Will you remain quite unconcern'd, While for your souls the watchmen mourn? They weep to think how you will stand With frightful ghosts at God's left hand. 3 O mortals! view the dream of life, And see how thousands end the strife, Who, though convinced, do still delay, Till death ensues and drags away: Will you for fancied earthly toys Deprive yourselves of heav'nly joys? And will the calls you have to-day Be slighted still and pass away? 4 The trying scene will shortly come, When you must hear your certain doom; And if you then go unprepared, You'll bear in mind the truths you've heard, Your sparkling eyes will then roll round, While death will bring you to the ground The coffin, grave, and winding sheet, Will hold your lifeless frame complete. 5 Your friends will then pass by your tomb, And view the grass around it grown, And heave a sigh to think you're gone To the land where there's no return. O mortals! now improve your time, And while the gospel sun doth shine Fly swift to Christ, he is your friend, And then in heav'n your souls will end.

Dear bow'r where the pine and the poplar have spread, And wove, with their branches, a roof o'er my head, How oft have I knelt on the evergreen there, And pour'd out my soul to my Saviour in prayer, my Saviour in prayer. 3. The early shrill notes of the loved nightingale That dwelt in my bower, I observed as my bell, To call me to duty, while birds of the air Sing anthems of praises as I went to prayer, 4. How sweet were the zephyrs perfumed by the pine, The ivy, the balsam, and wild eglantine; But sweeter, ah! sweeter, superlative were The joys I have tasted in answer to prayer. 5. For Jesus, my Saviour, oft deign'd there to meet, And bless'd with his presence my humble retreat Oft fill'd me with rapture and blessedness there, Inditing, in heaven's own language, my prayer. 6. Dear bower, I must leave you and bid you adieu, And pay my devotions in parts that are new, For Jesus, my Saviour, resides everywhere, And can, in all places give answer to prayer. [How tedious and tasteless the hours] The following poem is scored for music in the source text. [1] How tedious and tasteless the hours, When Jesus no longer I see; Sweet prospects, sweet birds, and sweet flow'rs, Have all lost their sweetness to me. The midsummer sun shines but dim, The fields strive in vain to look gay, But when I am happy in him, December's as pleasant as May. 2 His name yields the richest perfume, And sweeter than music his voice; His presence disperses my groom, And makes all within me rejoice; I should, were he always thus nigh, Have nothing to wish or to fear; No mortal so happy as I, My summer would last all the year. 3 Content with beholding his face, My all to his pleasure resign'd; No changes of season or place, Would make any change in my mind While bless'd with a sense of his love, A palace a toy would appear, And prisons would palaces prove, If Jesus would dwell with me there. 4 Dear Lord, if indeed I am thine, If thou art my sun and my song, Say, why do I languish and pine, And why are my winters so long! O, drive these dark clouds from my sky Thy soul-cheering presence restore Or take me unto thee on high.

O happy day! O joyful hour! When, freed from earth, my soul shall tow'r Beyond the reach of Satan's pow'r, To be for ever blest 3 My soul anticipates the day, I'll joyfully the call obey, Which comes to summon me away To seats prepared above. There I shall see my Saviour's face, And dwell in his beloved embrace And taste the fulness of his grace. And sing redeeming love. 4 Though dire afflictions press me sore, And death's dark billows roll before, Yet still by faith I see the shore, Beyond the rolling flood: The banks of Canaan, sweet and fair, Before my raptured eyes appear: It makes me think I'm almost there, In yonder bright abode. 5 To earthly cares I bid farewell, And triumph over death and hell, And go where saints and angels dwell, To praise th' Eternal Three. I'll join with those who're gone before, Who sing and shout their sufferings o'er, Where pain and parting are no more, To all eternity. 6 Adieu, ye scenes of noise and show, And all this region here below, Where naught but disappointments grow A better world's in view. My Saviour calls! I haste away. I would not here for ever stay; Hail! ye bright realms of endless day Vain world, once more adieu!

O fly from the flames of devouring fire, And wash your pollution in Jesus's blood 8 Brethren, in sweet gales we are all breezing, My soul feels the mighty, the heavenly flame; I'm now on my journey, my faith is increasing, All glory and praise to God and the Lamb. [Come, all ye young people of every relation] The following poem is scored for music in the source text. 1 Come, all ye young people of every relation, Come listen awhile, and to you I will tell How I was first called to seek for salvation, Redemption in Jesus who saved me from hell. 2 I was not yet sixteen when Jesus first call'd me, To think of my soul, and the state I was in; I saw myself standing a distance from Jesus, Between me and him was a mountain of sin. 3 The devil perceived that I was convinced, He strove to persuade me that I was too young, That I would get weary before my ascension, And wish that I had not so early begun. 4 Sometimes he'd persuade me that Jesus was partial, When he was a setting of poor sinners free, That I was forsaken, and quite reprobated, And there was no mercy at all for poor me. 5 But glory to Jesus, his love's not confined To princes, nor men of a nobler degree; His love it flows bounteous to all human creatures, He died for poor sinners, when nail'd to the tree. 6 And when I was groaning in sad lamentation, My soul overwhelm'd in sorrow and in sin, He drew near me in mercy, and look'd on me with pity, He pardon'd my sins, and he gave me relief 7 And now I've found favour in Jesus my Saviour, And all his commandments I'm bound to obey; I trust he will keep me from all Satan's power, Till he shall think proper to call me away. 8 So farewell, young people, if I can't persuade you To leave off your follies and go with a friend, I'll follow my Saviour, in whom I've found favour My days to his glory I'm bound for to spend.

[1] There was a Romish lady brought up in popery, Her mother always taught her the priest she must obey; O pardon me, dear mother, I humbly pray thee now For unto these false idols I can no longer bow. 2 Assisted by her handmaid, a Bible she conceal'd, And there she gain'd instruction, till God his love reveal'd; No more she prostrates herself to pictures deck'd with gold, But soon she was betray'd, and her Bible from her [illeg.] 3 I'll bow to my dear Jesus, I'll worship God unseen, I'll live by faith for ever, the works of men are vain; I cannot worship angels, nor pictures made by men; Dear mother, use your pleasure, but pardon if you can. 4 With grief and great vexation, her mother straight did go T' inform the Roman clergy the cause of all her wo: The priests were soon assembled, and for the maid did call, And forced her in the dungeon, to fright her soul withal. 5 The more they strove to fright her, the more she did endure, Although her age was tender, her faith was strong and sure. The chains of gold so costly they from this lady took, And she with all her spirits, the pride of life forsook. 6 Before the pope they brought her, in hopes of her return, And there she was condemned in horrid flames to burn. Before the place of torment they brought her speedily, With lifted hands to heaven, she then agreed to die. 7 There being many ladies assembled at the place, She raised her eyes to heaven, and begg'd supplying grace Weep not, ye tender ladies, shed not a tear for me— While my poor body's burning, my soul the Lord shall see. 8 Yourselves you need to pity, and Zion's deep decay; Dear ladies, turn to Jesus, no longer make delay. In comes her raving mother, her daughter to behold, And in her hand she brought her pictures deck'd with gold. 9 O take from me these idols, remove them from my sight; Restore to me my Bible, wherein I take delight. Alas, my aged mother, why on my ruin bent? 'Twas you that did betray me, but I am innocent. 10 Tormentors, use your pleasure, and do as you think best— I hope my blessed Jesus will take my soul to rest. Soon as these words were spoken, up steps the man of death, And kindled up the fire to stop her mortal breath. 11 Instead of golden bracelets, with chains they bound her fast; She cried, “My God give power now must I die at last? With Jesus and his angels for ever I shall dwell. God pardon priest and people, and so I bid farewell! [Dark and thorny is the desert] The following poem is scored for music in the source text. [1] Dark and thorny is the desert, Through which pilgrims make their way; But beyond this vale of sorrows Lie the fields of endless day. Fiends, loud howling through the desert, Make them tremble as they go; And the fiery darts of Satan Often bring their courage low. 2 O, young soldiers, are you weary Of the troubles of the way? Does your strength begin to fail you, And your vigour to decay? Jesus, Jesus, will go with you, He will lead you to his throne; He who dyed his garments for you, And the wine-press trod alone. 3 He whose thunder shakes creation, He who bids the planets roll; He who rides upon the tempest, And whose sceptre sways the whole. Round him are ten thousand angels, Ready to obey command; They are always hovering round you, Till you reach the heav'nly land. 4 There, on flowery hills of pleasure, In the fields of endless rest, Love, and joy, and peace shall ever Reign and triumph in your breast Who can paint those scenes of glory, Where the ransom'd dwell on high? Where the golden harps for ever Sound redemption through the sky? 5 Millions there of flaming seraphs Fly across the heavenly plain; There they sing immortal praises— Glory! glory! is their strain: But methinks a sweeter concert Makes the heavenly arches ring. And a song is heard in Zion Which the angels cannot sing. 6 See the heavenly host, in rapture, Gaze upon this shining band; Wondering at their costly garments, And the laurels in their hand! There, upon the golden pavement, See the ransom'd march along, While the splendid courts of glory Sweetly echo to their song. 7 O their crowns, how bright they sparkle! Such as monarchs never wear; They are gone to heav'nly pastures— Jesus is their Shepherd there. Hail, ye happy, happy spirits! Welcome to the blissful plain!— Glory, honour, and salvation! Reign, sweet Shepherd, ever reign [Come, humble sinner, in whose breast] The following poem is scored for music in the source text.

[1.] A story most lovely I'll tell, Of Jesus (O wond'rous surprise!) He suffer'd the torments of hell, That sinners, vile sinners might rise: He left his exalted abode, When man by transgression was lost; Appeasing the wrath of a God, He shed forth his blood as the cost. 2. O, did my dear Jesus thus bleed, And pity a ruin'd lost race! O, whence did such mercy proceed, Such boundless compassion and grace! His body bore anguish and pain, His spirit 'most sunk with the load; A short time before he was slain. His sweat was as great drops of blood 3. O, was it for crimes I had done, The Saviour was hail'd with a kiss! By Judas the traitor alone; Was ever compassion like this? The ruffians all join'd in a band, Confined him and led him away, The cords wrapt around his sweet hands, O sinners! look at him, I pray. 4. To Pilate's stone pillar when led, His body was lashed with whips: It never by any was said, A railing word dropt from his lips: They made him a crown out of thorns; They smote him and did him abuse; They clothed him with crimson, in scorn, And hail'd him, the King of the Jews. 5. They loaded the Lamb with the cross, And drove him up Calvary's hill; Come, mourners, a moment, and pause, All nature look'd solemn and still! They rushed the nails through his hands, Transfixed and tortured his feet; O brethren, see passive he stands; To look at the sight it is great! 6. He cried, My Father, my God, Forsaken! thou'st left me in pain! The cross was all colour'd with blood, The temple-vail bursted in twain: He groaned his last and he died, The sun it refused to shine; They rushed the spear in his side; This lovely Redeemer is mine. 7. He fought the hard battle, and won The vict'ry, and gives it most free: O Christians! look forward and run, In hopes that his kingdom you'll see; When he in the clouds shall appear, With angels all at his command, And thousands of Christians be there, All singing with harps in a band. 8. How pleasant and happy the view! Enjoying such beams of delight! His beauty to Christians he'll show, O Jesus, I long for the sight! I long to mount up in the skies, In Paradise make my abode, And sing of salvation on high, And rest with a pacified God. [Wake, Isles of the South! your redemption is near] The words of this piece were “composed by Wm. B. Tappan, Esq.. and sung on the wharf at New Haven, at the embarkation of the missionaries for the Sandwich Islands, in 1822.” O what hath God wrought in those islands since that time! “The parched ground has become a pool”—“The shrines of Atöol” have, indeed, become “sacred to God.” The largest church on earth is there; those poor heathens have been given to Jesus for his “inheritance”—those “uttermost parts of the earth, for his possession!” “Alleluia! the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth!”—W.H. The following poem is scored for music in the source text. 1. Wake, Isles of the South! you redemption is near, No longer repose in the borders of gloom; The strength of his chosen in love shall appear, And light shall arise on the verge of the tomb, And light shall arise on the verge of the tomb. 2. The billows that girt you, the wild waves that roar, The zephyrs that play where the ocean-storms cease, Shall bear the rich freight to your desolate shore, Shall waft the glad tidings of pardon and peace. 3. On the islands that sit in the regions of night, The lands of despair, to oblivion a prey, The morning will open with healing and light, The glad Star of Bethlehem brighten to day. 4. The altar and idol in dust overthrown, The incense forbade that was hallow'd with blood; The priest of Melchizedek there shall atone, And the shrine of Atöol be sacred to God. 5. The heathen will hasten to welcome the time, The day-spring, the prophet in vision once saw, When the beams of Messiah will 'lumine each clime, And the isles of the ocean shall wait for his law. [Hail! ye sighing sons of sorrow] The following poem is scored for music in the source text. [1] Hail! ye sighing sons of sorrow, Learn from me your certain doom; Learn from me your fate tomorrow, Dead—perhaps laid in your tomb! See all nature fading, dying! Silent all things seem to pine; Life from vegetation flying, Brings to mind “the mould'ring vine.” 2 See! in yonder forest standing, Lofty cedars, how they nod! Scenes of nature how surprising, Read in nature nature's God. Whilst the annual frosts are cropping, Leaves and tendrils from the trees, So our friends are early drooping, We are like to one of these. 3 Hollow winds about me roaring, Noisy waters round me rise; Whilst I sit my fate deploring, Tears fast streaming from my eyes What to me is autumn's treasure Since I know no earthly joy, Long I've lost all youthful pleasure, Time must youth and health destroy [Come away to the skies, My beloved, arise] The following poem is scored for music in the source text.

Now created again That our souls may remain, Throughout time and eternity thine 5 We with thanks do approve, The design of that love Which hath join'd us to Jesus's name; So united in heart, Let us never more part, Till we meet at the feast of the Lamb. 6 There, O! there at his feet, We shall all likewise meet, And be parted in body no more; We shall sing to our lyres, With the heavenly choirs, And our Saviour in glory adore. 7 Hallelujah we sing, To our Father and King, And his rapturous praises repeat: To the Lamb that was slain, Hallelujah again, Sing, all heaven and fall at his feet.

I sought her on the flow'ry lawn, Where pleasure holds her train; But fancy flies from flower to flower, So there I sought in vain, So there I sought in vain. 4. 'Twas on Ambition's craggy hill, The Bird of Peace might stray; I sought her there, tho' vainly still, She never flew that way, She never flew that way. 5. Faith smiled, and shed a silent tear, To see my search around, Then whisper'd, “I will tell you where The Dove may yet be found, The Dove may yet be found. 6. “By meek Religion's humble cot, She builds her downy nest; Go, seek that sweet secluded spot, And win her to your breast, And win her to your breast.” [There is a happy land] The following poem is scored for music in the source text. 1.

Thou hast sterner work to do, Hast to cut thy passage through; Close behind the gulfs are burning: Forward then, there's no returning. [Young people all, attention give] The following poem is scored for music in the source text. 1 Young people all, attention give, While I address you in God's name; You who in sin and folly live, Come hear the counsel of a friend. I've sought for bliss in glitt'ring toys, And ranged the luring scenes of vice; But never knew substantial joys, Until I heard my Saviour's voice. 2 He spake at once my sins forgiven, And wash'd my load of guilt away; He gave me glory, peace, and heaven, And thus I found the heav'nly way And now with trembling sense I view The billows roll beneath your feet; For death eternal waits for you, Who slight the force of gospel truth 3 Youth, like the spring, will soon be gone By fleeting time or conquering death, Your morning sun may set at noon, And leave you ever in the dark. Your sparkling eyes and blooming cheeks Must wither like the blasted rose; The coffin, earth, and winding sheet Will soon your active limbs enclose. 4 Ye heedless ones that wildly stroll, The grave will soon become your bed, Where silence reigns, and vapours roll In solemn darkness round your head. Your friends will pass the lonesome place, And with a sigh move slow along; Still gazing on the spires of grass With which your graves are overgrown. 5 Your souls will land in darker realms, Where vengeance reigns and billows roar, And roll amid the burning flames, When thousand thousand years are o'er. Sunk in the shades of endless night, To groan and howl in endless pain, And never more behold the light, And never, never rise again. 6 Ye blooming youth, this is the state Of all who do free grace refuse; And soon with you 'twill be too late The way of life and Christ to choose. Come, lay your carnal weapons by, No longer fight against your God But with the gospel now comply And heav'n shall be your great reward. [He comes! he comes! to judge the world] The following poem is scored for music in the source text. [1] He comes! he comes! to judge the world, Aloud th' archangel cries; While thunders roll from pole to pole, And lightnings cleave the skies; Th' affrighted nations hear the sound, And upward lift their eyes; The slumb'ring tenants of the ground In living armies rice. 2 Amid the shouts of numerous friends, Of hosts divinely bright, The Judge in solemn pomp descends, Array'd in robes of light; His head and hair are white as snow, His eyes a fiery flame, A radiant crown adorns his brow, And Jesus is his name. 3 Writ on his thigh his name appears, And scars his victories tell; Lo! in his hand the conqueror bears The keys of death and hell: So he ascends the judgment-seat, And at his dread command, Myriads of creatures round his feet In solemn silence stand. 4 Princes and peasants here expect Their last, their righteous doom; The men who dared his grace reject, And they who dared presume. “Depart, ye sons of vice and sin,” The injured Jesus cries, While the long kindling wrath within Flashes from both his eyes. 5 And now in words divinely sweet, With rapture in his face, Aloud his sacred lips repeat The sentence of his grace: “Well done, my good and faithful sons, The children of my love, Receive the sceptres, crowns and thrones, Prepared for you above.” [My days, my weeks, my months, my years] The following poem is scored for music in the source text.

And whisper as they fly; Unthinking man, remember this, Though fond of sublunary bliss, That you must groan and die. 3 My soul, attend the solemn call, Thine earthly tent must shortly fall And thou must take thy flight Beyond the vast expansive blue, To sing above as angels do. Or sink in endless night. [I sing a song which doth belong to all the human race] The following poem is scored for music in the source text. [1.] I sing a song which doth belong to all the human race, Concerning death, which steals the breath, and blasts the comely face; Come listen all unto my call, which I do make today For you must die as well as I, And pass from hence away. 2. No human power can stop the hour, wherein a mortal dies; A Cæsar may be great to-day, yet death will close his eyes: Though some do strive and do arrive to riches and renown, Enjoying health and swim in wealth, yet death will bring them down. 3. Though beauty grace your comely face, with roses white and red, A dying fall will spoil it all, for Absalom is dead: Though you acquire the best attire, appearing fine and fair. Yet death will come into the room, and strip you naked there. 4. The princes high and beggars die, and mingle with the dust, The rich, the brave, the negro slave, the wicked and the just: Therefore prepare to meet thy God, before it be too late, Or else you'll weep, lament and cry, lost in a ruin'd state.

Sweetest sound in seraphs' song— Sweetest notes on mortal tongue Sweetest carol eve, sung— Jesus, Jesus, roll along [How firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord] The following poem is scored for music in the source text.

I, I am thy God, and will still give thee aid; I'll strengthen thee, help thee, and cause hee to stand, Upheld by my righteous, omnipotent hand. 4 “When through the deep waters I call thee to go, The rivers of water shall not overflow; For I will be with thee thy troubles to bless And sanctify to thee thy deepest distress. 5 “When through fiery trials thy pathway shall he, My grace, all-sufficient, shall be thy supply; The flame shall not hurt thee; I only design Thy dross to consume, and thy gold to refine. 6 “E'en down to old age, all my people shall prove My sovereign, eternal, unchangeable love: And when hoary hairs shall their temples adorn, Like lambs they shall still in my bosom be borne. 7 “The soul that on Jesus hath lean'd for repose, I will not, I will not, desert to his foes; That soul, though all hell should endeavour to shake I'll never, no never, no never forsake.” [Vain, delusive world, adieu] The following poem is scored for music in the source text.

Me to save from endless wo, The sin-atoning victim died! Only Jesus will I know, And Jesus crucified! 3 Here will I set up my rest; My fluctuating heart From the haven of his breast Shall never more depart: Whither should a sinner go? His wounds for me stand open wide; Only Jesus will I know And Jesus crucified 4 Him to know is life and peace, And pleasure without end; This is all my happiness, On Jesus to depend; Daily in his grace to grow, And ever in his faith abide, Only Jesus will I know, And Jesus crucified! 5 O that I could all invite, This saving truth to prove: Show the length, the breadth, the heigh And depth of Jesus' love! Fain I would to sinners show The blood by faith alone applied! Only Jesus will I know And Jesus crucified [Brethren, we have met to worship] The following poem is scored for music in the source text.

[1] From Greenland's icy mountains, From India's coral strand; Where Afric's sunny fountains Roll down their golden sand; From many an ancient river, From many a palmy plain, They call us to deliver Their land from error's chain. 2 What though the spicy breeze Blow soft o'er Ceylon's isle, Though every prospect pleases, And only man is vile; In vain, with lavish kindness, The gifts of God are strown; The heathen, in his blindness, Bows down to wood and stone. 3 Shall we, whose souls are lighted With wisdom from on high, Shall we, to men benighted, The lamp of life deny? Salvation! O salvation! The joyful sound proclaim, Till earth's remotest nation Has learn'd Messiah's name. 4 Waft, waft, ye winds, his story, And you, ye waters, roll Till, like a sea of glory, It spreads from pole to pole Till o'er our ransom'd nature. The Lamb for sinners slain, Redeemer, King, Creator In bliss returns to reign. [Say now, ye lovely social band] The following poem is scored for music in the source text. 1. Say now, ye lovely social band, Who walk the way to Canaan's land; Ye who have fled from Sodom's plain, Say, would you now return again? Have you just ventured to the field, Well arm'd with helmet, sword, and shield, And shall the world, with dread alarms, Compel you now to ground your arms? 2. Beware of pleasure's siren song; Alas! it cannot soothe you long; It cannot quiet Jordan's wave, Nor cheer the dark and silent grave. O let your thoughts delight to soar Where earth and time shall be no more; Explore by faith the heavenly fields, And pluck the fruit that Canaan yields. 3. There see the glorious hosts on wing, And hear the heav'nly seraphs sing! The shining ranks in order stand, Or move like lightning at command. Jehovah there reigns not alone, The Saviour shares his Father's throne, While angels circle round his seat, And worship prostrate at his feet. 4. Behold! I see, among the rest, A host in richer garments dress'd; A host that near his presence stands, And palms of victory grace their hands. Say, who are these I now behold, With blood-wash'd robes and crowns of gold! This glorious host is not unknown To him who sits upon the throne. 5. These are the followers of the Lamb; From tribulation great they came; And on the hill of sweet repose They bid adieu to all their woes. Soon on the wings of love you'll fly, To join them in that world on high;— O make it now your chiefest care The image of your Lord to bear [My Christian friends, in bonds of love] The following poem is scored for music in the source text. 1 My Christian friends, in bonds of love, Whose hearts in sweetest union join, Your friendship's like a drawing band, Yet we must take the parting hand. 2 Your company's sweet, your union dear, Your words delightful to my ear, Yet when I see that we must part, You draw like cords around my heart. 3 How sweet the hours have pass'd away, Since we have met to sing and pray; How loath we are to leave the place Where Jesus shows his smiling face. 4 O could I stay with friends so kind, How would it cheer my drooping mind! But duty makes me understand, That we must take the parting hand, 5 And since it is God's holy will, We must be parted for a while, In sweet submission, all as one, We'll say, our Father's will be done. 6 My youthful friends, in Christian ties, Who seek for mansions in the skies, Fight on, we'll gain that happy shore, Where parting will be known no more. 7 How oft I've seen your flowing tears, And heard you tell your hopes and fears! Your hearts with love were seen to flame, Which makes me hope well meet again. 8 Ye mourning souls, lift up your eyes To glorious mansions in the skies; O trust his grace—in Canaan's land, We'll no more take the parting hand. 9 And now, my friends, both old and young, I hope in Christ you'll still go on; And if on earth we meet no more, O may we meet on Canaan's shore. 10 I hope you'll all remember me, If you on earth no more I see; An interest in your prayers I crave, That we may meet beyond the grave. 11 O glorious day! O blessed hope! My soul leaps forward at the thought, When, on that happy, happy land, We'll no more take the parting hand. 12 But with our blessed, holy Lord, We'll shout and sing with one accord And there we'll all with Jesus dwell So, loving Christians, fare you well.

O! what can be compar'd to him Who died upon the tree! This is my dear, delightful theme That Jesus died for me. 2 When at the table of the Lord We humbly take our place, The death of Jesus we record, With love and thankfulness These emblems bring my Lord to view, Upon the bloody tree, My soul believes and feels it's true, That Jesus died for me. 3 His body broken, nail'd, and torn, And stain'd with streams of blood, His spotless soul was left forlorn, Forsaken of his God. 'Twas then his Father gave the stroke That justice did decree; All nature felt the dreadful stroke. When Jesus died for me. 4 Eli lama sabachthani, My God, my God, he cried, Why hast thou thus forsaken me! And thus my Saviour died. But why did God forsake his Son, When bleeding on the tree? He died for sins, but not his own, For Jesus died for me 5 My guilt was on my Surety laid And therefore he must die; His soul a sacrifice was made. For such a worm as I Was ever love so great as this? Was ever grace so free? This is my glory, joy and bliss, That Jesus died for me. 6 He took his meritorious blood, And rose above the skies, And in the presence of his God, Presents his sacrifice. His intercession must prevail With such a glorious plea My cause can never, never fail, For Jesus died for me 7 Angels in shining order sit Around my Saviour's throne; They bow with reverence at his feet And make his glories known. Those happy spirits sing his praise To all eternity; But I can sing redeeming grace For Jesus died for me. 8 O! had I but an angel's voice To bear my heart along, My flowing numbers soon would raise To an immortal song. I'd charm their harps and golden lyres In sweetest harmony, And tell to all the heavenly choirs That Jesus died for me.

Glory, honour, &amp;c. 3 Now let each one cease from sinning, Come and follow Christ the way; We shall all receive a blessing, If from him we do not stray; Golden moments we've neglected, Yet the Lord invites again! Glory, honour, &amp;c. 4 Come, let us run our race with patience, Looking unto Christ the Lord, Who doth live and reign for ever, With his Father and our God; He is worthy to be praised, He is our exalted king, Glory, honour, &amp;c. 5 Come, dear children, praise your Jesus, Praise him, praise him evermore. May his great love now constrain us, His great name for to adore; O then let us join together, Crowns of glory to obtain! Glory, honour, &amp;c.</field>

And O, my friends, prove faithful, And on your way pursue. 4 Whene'er you meet with troubles And trials on your way, Then cast your care on Jesus, And don't forget to pray. Gird on the gospel armour Of faith, and hope, and love, And when the combat's ended, He'll carry you above. 5 O do not be discouraged, For Jesus is your friend; And if you lack for knowledge, He'll not refuse to lend. Neither will he upbraid you, Though often you request, He'll give you grace to conquer, And take you home to rest. 6 And when the last loud trumpet Shall rend the vaulted skies, And bid th' entombed millions From their cold beds arise; Our ransom'd dust, revived, Bright beauties shall put on And soar to the blest mansions Where our Redeemer's gone. 7 Our eyes shall then with rapture, The Saviour's face behold; Our feet, no more diverted, Shall walk the streets of gold Our ears shall hear with transport The hosts celestial sing; Our tongues shall chant the glories Of our immortal King.

Jesus, I my cross have taken, All to leave and follow thee: Naked, poor, despised, forsaken, Thou from hence my all shalt be: Perish ev'ry fond ambition, All I've sought, or hoped, or known, Yet how rich is my condition, God and heav'n are still my own! 2. Let the world despise and leave me, They have left my Saviour, too; Human hearts and looks deceive me, Thou art not like them, untrue; And whilst thou shalt smile upon me, God of wisdom, love, and might, Foes may hate, and friends disown me; Show thy face and all is bright. 3. Go, then, earthly fame and treasure, Come, disaster, scorn, and pain; In thy service pain is pleasure, With thy favour loss is gain. I have called thee, Abba, Father, I have set my heart on thee: Storms may howl, and clouds may gather, All must work for good to me. 4. Man may trouble and distress me, 'Twill but drive me to thy breast; Life with trials hard may press me, Heav'n will bring me sweeter rest. Oh! 'tis not in grief to harm me, While thy love is left to me; Oh! 'twere not in joy to charm me, Were that joy unmix'd with thee. 5. Soul, then know thy full salvation; Rise o'er sin, and fear, and care; Joy to find, in ev'ry station, Something still to do or bear: Think what Spirit dwells within thee; Think what Father's smiles are thine; Think that Jesus died to win thee; Child of heaven, canst thou repine? 6. Haste thee on from grace to glory, Arm'd by faith, and wing'd by prayer! Heaven's eternal day's before thee, God's own hand shall guide thee there: Soon shall close thy earthly mission, Soon shall pass thy pilgrim days; Hope shall change to glad fruition, Faith to sight, and prayer to praise.

He hath loved me, I cried, He hath suffer'd and died, To redeem such a rebel as me. 5 On the wings of his love, I was carried above All sin and temptation, and pain I could not believe That I ever should grieve, That I ever should suffer again. 6 I rode on the sky, Freely justified I, Nor envied Elijah his seat; My soul mounted higher, In a chariot of fire, And the world was put under my feet 7 O! the rapturous height Of that holy delight Which I felt in the life-giving blood, Of my Saviour possess'd, I was perfectly bless'd, Overwhelm'd with the fulness of God. 8 What a mercy is this! What a heaven of bliss! How unspeakably favour'd am I! Gather'd into the fold, With believers enroll'd, With believers to live and to die! 9 Now my remnant of days Would I spend to his praise, Who hath died my poor soul to redeem.

Who would cast away his shield?— Let him basely go: Who for Zion's King will stand? Who will join the faithful band? Let him come with heart and hand, Let him face the foe. 3 By the mercies of our God, By Emmanuel's streaming blood, When alone for us he stood, Ne'er give up the strife: Ever to the latest breath, Hark to what your Captain saith;— “Be thou faithful unto death; Take the crown of life.” 4 By the woes which rebels prove, By the bliss of holy love, Sinners, seek the joys above, Sinners turn, and live! Here is freedom worth the name; Tyrant sin is put to shame; Grace inspires the hallow'd flame God the crown will give.

Each morn when the sun gilds the east, (The green grass bespangled with dew,) He'll cast his bright beams on the west, To charm the sad Caroline's view. 3 O Corydon! hear the sad cries Of Caroline, plaintive and slow; O spirit! look down from the skies, And pity thy mourner below; 'Tis Caroline's voice in the grove, Which Philomel hears on the plain; Then striving the mourner to soothe, With sympathy joins in her strain. 4 Ye shepherds so blithesome and young, Retire from your sports on the green, Since Corydon's deaf to my song, The wolves tear the lambs on the plain; Each swain round the forest will stray And sorrowing hang down his head, His pipe then in symphony play, Some dirge to sweet Corydon's shade. 5 And when the still night has unfurl'd Her robes o'er the hamlet around, Gray twilight retires from the world, And darkness encumbers the ground, I'll leave my own gloomy abode, To Corydon's urn will I fly, There kneeling will bless the just God Who dwells in bright mansions on high [When Gabriel's awful trump shall sound] The following poem is scored for music in the source text.

Kingdoms wide, that sit in darkness, Grant them, Lord, the glorious light, And from eastern coast to western May the morning chase the night: And redemption Freely purchased, win the day. 4. May the glorious day approaching, On the grossest darkness dawn; And the everlasting gospel Spread abroad thy holy name— All the borders Of the great Emmanuel's land. 5. Fly abroad, thou mighty Gospel, Win and conquer, never cease; May thy lasting, wide dominions Multiply and still increase; Sway the sceptre, Saviour, all the world around.

Let ev'ry heart prepare a throne, And ev'ry voice a song. On him the Spirit largely pour'd, Exerts his sacred fire; Wisdom and might, and zeal and love His holy breast inspire. 2. He comes, the pris'ners to release, In Satan's bondage held; The gates of brass before him burst, The iron fetters yield. He comes, from thickest films of vice, To clear the mental ray; And on the eyes oppress'd with night To pour celestial day. 3. He comes, the broken heart to bind, The bleeding soul to cure, And with the treasures of his grace, T' enrich the humble poor. Our glad hosannahs, Prince of peace, Thy welcome shall proclaim, And heav'n's eternal arches ring With thy beloved name.

How damp were the vapors that fell on his head! How hard was his pillow! how humble his bed! The angels, astonish'd, grew sad at the sight, And follow'd their Master with solemn delight. 3. O garden of Olivet, dear honour'd spot! The fame of thy wonder shall ne'er be forgot; The theme most transporting to seraphs above, The triumph of sorrow, the triumph of love. 4. Come, saints and adore him; come, bow at his feet! Oh, give him the glory, the praise that is meet; Let joyful hosannas unceasingly rise, And join the full chorus that gladdens the skies.

I am the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valley; As the lily among the thorns, so is my love among the daughters; As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight. And his fruit was sweet to my taste; He brought me to the banqueting house, his banner over me was love. Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples, For I am sick of love: I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, By the roes, and by the hinds of the field, That you stir not up, nor awake my love, till he please. The voice of my beloved, Behold! he cometh, leaping upon the mountains, skipping, leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills. My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away. For lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone.

And I heard a mighty angel flying through the midst of heav'n, crying with a loud voice, Wo, wo, wo, wo, Be unto the earth by reason of the trumpet which is yet to sound. And when the last trumpet sounded, the great men and nobles, rich men and poor, bond and free, gathered themselves together, and cried to the rocks and mountains to fall upon them, and hide them from the face of Him that sitteth on the throne, For the great day of the Lord is come, and who shall be able to stand? [The morning sun shines from the east] The following poem is scored for music in the source text. The morning sun shines from the east, And spreads his glories to the west, All nations with his beams are blest, Where'er the radiant light appears.

Fair freedom her attendant waits, To bless the portals of her gates, To crown the young and rising states With laurels of immortal day: The British yoke, the Gallic chain, Was urged upon our necks in vain, All haughty tyrants we disdain, And shout, Long live America.

My friends, I am going a long and tedious journey, Never to return. I am going a long journey, Never to return. Fare you well, my friends.</field>

Before the great review; And at his feet with rapture fall, And Heaven brings something new [See how the wicked kingdom] The following poem is scored for music in the source text. 1 See how the wicked kingdom Is falling ev'ry day!

So often I'm surrounded With enemies from hell. 2 With weeping and with praying, My Jesus I have found, To crucify old nature, And make his grace abound. Dear children, don't be weary, But march on in the way; For Jesus will stand by you, And be your guard and stay. 3 If sinners will serve Satan, And join with one accord, Dear brethren, as for my part, I'm bound to serve the Lord; And if you will go with me, Pray give to me your hand, And we'll march on together, Unto the promised land. 4 Through troubles and distresses, We'll make our way to God; Though earth and hell oppose us, We'll keep the heavenly road. Our Jesus went before us, And many sorrows bore, And we who follow after, Can never meet with more. 5 Thou dear to me, my brethren, Each one of you I find. My duty now compels me To leave you all behind: But while the parting grieves us, I humbly ask your prayers, To bear me up in trouble, And conquer all my fears. 6 And now, my loving brothers, I bid you all farewell! With you my loving sisters, I can no longer dwell. Farewell to every mourner! I hope the Lord you'll find, To ease you of your burden, And give you peace of mind 7 Farewell, poor careless sinners! I love you dearly well; I've labour'd much to bring you With Jesus Christ to dwell, I now am bound to leave you— O tell me, will you go?

I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay, And pensively stood by the tomb, When in a low whisper I heard something say, How sweetly I sleep here alone! 2. The tempest may howl, and the loud thunder roar, And gathering storms may arise, Yet calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul, The tears are all wiped from my eyes. 3. The cause of my Master compell'd me from home, I bade my companions farewell; I blest my dear children, who now for me mourn— In far distant regions they dwell. 4. I wander'd an exile and stranger from home, No kindred or relative nigh; I met the contagion, and sank to the tomb, My soul flew to mansions on high. 5. Oh tell my companion and children most dear, To weep not for me now I'm gone; The same hand that led me through scenes most severe, Has kindly assisted me home. The sixth verse was composed by J. J. Hicks, of North Carolina.6. And there is a crown that doth glitter and shine, That I shall for evermore wear: Then turn to the Saviour, his love's all divine All you that would dwell with me there.

With us thy fond spirit did not tarry long, But the sunshine of heaven beam'd bright on thy waking, And the sound thou didst hear was the seraphim's song. 4 Thou art gone to the grave, but 'twere wrong to deplore thee, When God was thy ransom, and guardian, and guide, He gave thee, and took thee, and soon will restore thee, Where death hath no sting, since the Saviour hath died [Our bondage it shall end, by and by, by and by] The following poem is scored for music in the source text. 1 Our bondage it shall end, by and by, From Egypt's yoke set free; Hail the glorious jubilee, And to Canaan we'll return, by and by. 2 Our deliverer he shall come, by and by, And our sorrows have an end, With our threescore years and ten, And vast glory crown the day, by and by 3 Though our enemies are strong, we'll go on Though our hearts dissolve with fear, Lo, Sinai's God is near, While the fiery pillar moves, we'll go on. 4 Though Marah has bitter streams, we'll go on; Though Baca's vale be dry, And the land yield no supply; To a land of corn and wine, we'll go on. 5 And when to Jordan's floods, we are come, Jehovah rules the tide, And the waters he'll divide, And the ransom'd host shall shout, we are come, 6 Then friends shall meet again, who have loved, Our embraces shall be sweet At the dear Redeemer's feet, When we meet to part no more, who have loved. 7 Then with all the happy throng, we'll rejoice Shouting glory to our King, Till the vaults of heaven ring, And through all eternity we'll rejoice [In the floods of tribulation] The following poem is scored for music in the source text.

Hallelujah, &amp;c. 6 In the sacred page recorded; Thus the word securely stands, Fear not, I'm in trouble near thee, Nought shall pluck thee from my hands.

Columbia! to glory arise, The queen of the world, and the child of the skies, Thy genius commands thee, with raptures behold, While ages on ages thy splendours unfold: Thy reign is the last and the noblest of time, Most fruitful thy soil, most inviting thy clime; Let crimes of the east ne'er encrimson thy name. Be freedom, and science, and virtue thy fame. 2 To conquest and slaughter let Europe aspire, Whelm nations in blood, or wrap cities in fire; Thy heroes the rights of mankind shall defend, And triumph pursue them and glory attend. A world is thy realm, for a world be thy laws, Enlarged as thy empire, and just as thy cause; On freedom's broad basis that empire shall rise, Extend with the main, and dissolve with the skies. 3 Fair science her gate to thy sons shall unbar, And the east see thy morn hide the beams of her star; New bards and new sages unrivall'd shall soar To fame unextinguish'd, when time is no more. To the last refuge of virtue design'd, Shall fly from all nations, the best of mankind, There, grateful to Heaven, with transport shall bring Their incense, more fragrant than odours of spring. 4 Nor less shall thy fair ones to glory ascend, And genius and beauty in harmony blend; Their graces of form shall awake pure desire, And the charms of the soul still enliven the fire: Their sweetness unmingled, their manners refined, And virtue's bright image enstamp'd on the mind; With peace and sweet rapture shall teach life to glow And light up a smile in the aspect of wo 5 Thy fleets to all regions thy power shall display The nations admire, and the ocean obey; Each shore to thy glory its tribute unfold, And the east and the south yield their spices and gold, As the day-spring unbounded thy splendours shall flow, And earth's little kingdoms before thee shall bow, While the ensigns of union in triumph unfurl'd, Hush anarchy's sway, and give peace to the world. 6 Thus down a lone valley with cedars o'erspread, From the noise of the town I pensively stray'd, The bloom from the face of fair heaven retired, The wind ceas'd to murmur, the thunders expired Perfumes, as of Eden, flow'd sweetly along, And a voice, as of angels, enchantingly sung, Columbia! Columbia! to glory arise, The queen of the world, and the child of the skies. [Hark! from the tombs a doleful sound] The following poem is scored for music in the source text.

Great God, is this our certain doom? And are we still secure? Still walking downward to the tomb, And yet prepare no more! 4. Grant us the power of quickening grace, To fit our souls to fly; Then, when we drop this dying flesh, We'll rise above the sky. [Today, if you will hear his voice] The following poem is scored for music in the source text. 1.

Your sports, and all your glittering toys, Compared with our celestial joys, Like momentary dreams appear:— Come, go with us—your souls are dear. Oh! turn, sinner, &amp;c. 6. Young women, now we look to you, Are you resolved to perish too? To rush in carnal pleasures on, And sink in flaming ruin down? Oh! turn, sinner, &amp;c. 7. Then, dear young friends, a long farewell, We 're bound to heav'n, but you to hell. Still God may hear us, while we pray, And change you ere that burning day. Oh! turn, sinner, &amp;c. 8. Once more I ask you, in his name; (I know his love remains the same) Say, will you to Mount Zion go? Say, will you have this Christ, or no? Oh! turn, sinner, &amp;c. 9. Come, you that love th' incarnate God, And feel redemption in his blood, Let 's watch and pray, and onward move, Till we shall meet in realms above. Oh! turn sinner, &amp;c. [Sometimes a light surprises] The following poem is scored for music in the source text. 1. Sometimes a light surprises The Christian while he sings It is the Lord who rises With healing in his wings: When comforts are declining, He grants the soul again A season of clear shining, To cheer it after rain. 2. In holy contemplation, We sweetly then pursue The theme of God's salvation, And find it ever new: Set free from present sorrow, We cheerfully can say, Let the unknown tomorrow Bring with it what it may. 3. It can bring with it nothing But he will bear us through; Who gives the lilies clothing Will clothe his people too: Beneath the spreading heavens, No creature but is fed, And he who feeds the ravens Will give his children bread. Though vine nor fig-tree neither Its wonted fruit should bear, Though all the fields should wither, Nor flocks nor herds be there, Yet God, the same abiding, His praise shall tune my voice, For while in him confiding I cannot but rejoice [High o'er the hills the mountains rise] The following poem is scored for music in the source text. This song was composed by the Author, in the fall of 1831, while travelling over the mountains, on French Broad River, in North Carolina and Tennessee. 1.

Oh, God! forbid that I should fall And lose my everlasting all; But may I rise on wings of love, And soar to the blest world above. 3. Although I walk the mountains high, Ere long my body low must lie, And in some lonesome place must rot, And by the living be forgot. 4. There it must lie till that great day, When Gabriel's awful trump shall say, Arise, the judgment day is come, When all must hear their final doom. 5. If not prepared, then I must go Down to eternal pain and wo, With devils there I must remain, And never more return again. 6. But if prepared, oh, blessed thought! I'll rise above the mountain's top, And there remain for evermore On Canaan's peaceful, happy shore. 7. Oh! when I think of that blest world, Where all God's people dwell in love, I oft-times long with them to be And dwell in heaven eternally. 8. Then will I sing God's praises there, Who brought me through my troubles here I'll sing, and be forever blest, Find sweet and everlasting rest.

Safe in the promised land: Those who wash'd their robes, and made them White and spotless pure, and laid them Where no earthly stain could fade them, Safe in the promised land. 4. Where are the holy Christians? Safe in the promised land: There our souls will join the chorus, Saints and angels sing before us, While all heaven is beaming o'er us, Safe in the promised land. 5. By and by we'll go and meet them, Safe in the promised land: There we'll sing and shout together, There we'll sing and shout hosanna, There we'll sing and shout forever, Safe in the promised land. 6. Glory to God Almighty, Who called us unto him, Who are blind by sinful nature. Who have sinned against our Maker, Who did send his son to save us, Safe in the promised land. 7. Where is our blessed Saviour? Safe in the promised land: He was scourged and crucified He by Romans was derided, Thus the Lord of glory died, To raise our souls above.

If God is mine, then present things, And things to come, are mine; Yea, Christ, his word, and Spirit too, And glory all divine. 2. If he is mine, then from his love, He every trouble sends; All things are working for my good, And bliss his rod attends. 3. If he is mine, I need not fear The rage of earth and hell; He will support my feeble frame, Their utmost force repel. 4. If he is mine, let friends forsake,— Let wealth and honours flee— Sure he, who giveth me himself, Is more than these to me. 5. If he is mine, I'll boldly pass Through death's tremendous vale: He is a solid comfort, when All other comforts fail. 6. Oh, tell me, Lord! that thou art mine; What can I wish beside? My soul shall at the fountain live, When all the streams are dried. [Let party names no more] The following poem is scored for music in the source text. 1.

Be banish'd far away: Those should in strictest friendship dwell Who the same Lord obey. 4. Thus will the church below Resemble that above; Where streams of pleasure ever flow, And every heart is love. [In evil long I took delight] The following poem is scored for music in the source text. 1. In evil long I took delight, Unaw'd by shame or fear, Till a new object struck my sight, And stopp'd my wild career. I saw one hanging on a tree In agonies and blood, Who fix'd his languid eyes on me, As near his cross I stood. 2. Sure never to my latest breath Can I forget that look; It seem'd to charge me with his death, Though not a word he spoke. My conscience felt and own'd the guilt, And plunged me in despair; I saw my sins his blood had spilt, And help'd to nail him there. 3. Alas! I knew not what I did; But now my tears are vain: Where shall my trembling soul be hid? For I the Lord have slain. A second look he gave, which said, “I freely all forgive; This blood is for thy ransom paid, I'll die that thou may'st live.” 4. Thus, while his death my sin displays In all its blackest hue; (Such is the mystery of grace,) It seals my pardon too. With pleasing grief and mournful joy My spirit now is fill'd, That I should such a life destroy, Yet live by him I kill'd.

Let me go to the spot where the cataracts play, Where I often have sported in boyhood's bright day, And there greet my fond mother whose heart will o'erflow At the sight of her child, let me go, let me go, At the sight of her child, oh! there let me go. 3. Let me go to my sire, by whose battle-scarr'd side I have sported so oft in the noon of my pride, And exulted to conquer the insolent foe; To my father, the chief, let me go, let me go, To my father, the chief, oh! there let me go. 4. And, oh! do let me go to my flashing eyed maid, Who hath taught me to love 'neath the green willow's shade; Whose heart like the fawn leaps, and is pure as the snow: To the bosom I love, let me go, let me go, To the bosom I love, oh! there let me go. 5. And, oh! do let me go to my wild forest home, No more from its life-cheering fond pleasures to roam 'Neath the grove of the glen let my ashes lie low, To my home in the wood let me go, let me go To my home in the wood, oh! there let me go [The glorious light of Zion Is spreading all around] The following poem is scored for music in the source text. 1.

While angelic legions, with harps tuned celestial, Harmoniously join in the concert of praise, The saints, as they flock from the regions terrestrial, In loud hallelujah their voices will raise; Then songs to the Lamb shall reecho through heaven, My soul will respond, to Immanuel be given All glory, all honour, all might and dominion, Who brought us, through grace to the Eden of love. 3.

On Zion's bright and flow'ry mount Behold the officers— Their horses white, their garments bright With crown and bow they stand, Enlisting soldiers for their King, To march for Canaan's land. 2. It sets my heart all in a flame; A soldier I will be; I will enlist, gird on my arms, And fight for liberty. They want no cowards in their band, (They will their colours fly,) But call for valiant-hearted men, Who're not afraid to die. 3. The armies now are in parade, How martial they appear! All arm'd and dress'd in uniform, They look like men of war: They follow their great General, The great Eternal Lamb His garments stain'd with his own blood, King Jesus is his name. 4. The trumpet sounds, the armies shout, And drive the hosts of hell; How dreadful is our God in arms! The great Immanuel!— Sinners, enlist with Jesus Christ Th' eternal Son of God, And march with us to Canaan's land, Beyond the swelling flood. 5. There is a green and flow'ry field, Where fruits immortal grow; There, clothed in white, the angels bright Our great Redeemer know. We'll shout and sing for evermore In that eternal world; But Satan and his armies too, Shall down to hell be hurl'd. 6. Hold up your heads, ye soldiers bold, Redemption 's drawing nigh We soon shall hear the trumpet sound 'T will shake both earth and sky; In fiery chariots then we'll fly. And leave the world on fire And meet around the starry throne To tune th' immortal lyre. [Jerusalem, my happy home] The following poem is scored for music in the source text. 1.

Come, ye weary, heavy laden, Lost and ruin'd by the fall; If you tarry till you're better, You will never come at all: Not the righteous— Sinners Jesus came to call. 5. View him prostrate in the garden; On the ground your Saviour lies! On the bloody tree behold him; Hear him cry, before he dies, “It is finished!” Sinners, will not this suffice? 6. Lo! th' incarnate God, ascending, Pleads the merit of his blood: Venture on him, venture wholly, Let no other trust intrude: None but Jesus Can do helpless sinners good. 7. Saints and angels, join'd in concert, Sing the praises of the Lamb: While the blissful seats of heaven Sweetly echo with his name. Hallelujah! Sinners here may sing the same.

Vainly we offer each ample oblation, Vainly with gold we his favour secure; Richer by far is the heart's adoration; Dearer to God are the prayers of the poor. 5. Low at his feet we in humble prostration, Lose all our sorrow and trouble and strife; There we receive his divine consolation, Flowing afresh from the fountain of life. 6.

It is not fann'd by summer gale; 'Tis not refresh'd by vernal show'rs; It never needs the moonbeam pale, For there are known no evening hours: No, for this world is ever bright With a pure radiance all its own; The stream of uncreated light Flows round it from th' eternal throne. 4.
