      <field name="fulltext">THE MAN OF UZ. PREFACE. THE arrogance of attempting a parody on the most ancient and sublime poem in the Inspired Volume, is not mine. The great pleasure enjoyed in its perusal from early years, had occasionally prompted metrical imitations of isolated passages. These fragmentary effusions, recently woven together, are here presented, with the hope that as wandering streams are traced to their original fountain, some heart may thus be led to the history of the stricken and sustained Patriarch with more studious research, purer delight, or a deeper spirit of devotion. L.H.S. HARTFORD, CONN., November 5th, 1862. A joyous festival.â The gathering back Of scattered flowrets to the household wreath. Brothers and sisters from their sever'd homes Meeting with ardent smile, to renovate The love that sprang from cradle memories And childhood's sports, and whose perennial stream Still threw fresh crystals o'er the sands of life. âEach bore some treasured picture of the past, Some graphic incident, by mellowing time Made beautiful, while ever and anon, Timbrel and harp broke forth, each pause between. Banquet and wine-cup, and the dance, gave speed To youthful spirits, and prolong'd the joy. The patriarch father, with a chasten'd heart Partook his children's mirth, having God's fear Ever before him. Earnestly he brought His offerings and his prayers for every one Of that beloved group, lest in the swell And surging superflux of happiness They might forget the Hand from whence it came, Perchance, displease the Almighty. Many a care Had he that wealth creates. Not such as lurks In heaps metallic, which the rust corrodes, But wealth that fructifies within the earth Whence cometh bread, or o'er its surface roves In peaceful forms of quadrupedal life That thronging round the world's first father came To take their names, 'mid Eden's tranquil shades, Ere sin was born. Obedient to the yoke, Five hundred oxen turn'd the furrow'd glebe Where agriculture hides his buried seed Waiting the harvest hope, while patient wrought An equal number of that race who share The labor of the steed, without his praise. âThree thousand camels, with their arching necks, Ships of the desert, knelt to do his will, And bear his surplus wealth to distant climes, While more than twice three thousand snowy sheep Whitened the hills. Troops of retainers fed These flocks and herds, and their subsistence drew From the same lord,âso that this man of Uz Greater than all the magnates of the east, Dwelt in old time before us. True he gave, And faithfully, the hireling his reward, Counting such justice 'mid the happier forms Of Charity, which with a liberal hand He to the sad and suffering poor dispensed. Eyes was he to the blind, and to the lame Feet, while the stranger and the traveller found Beneath the welcome shelter of his roof The blessed boon of hospitality. To him the fatherless and widow sought For aid and counsel. Fearlessly he rose For those who had no helper. His just mind Brought stifled truth to light, disarm'd the wiles Of power, and gave deliverance to the weak. He pluck'd the victim from the oppressor's grasp, And made the tyrant tremble. To his words Men listened, as to lore oracular, And when beside the gate he took his seat The young kept silence, and the old rose up To do him honor. After his decree None spake again, for as a prince he dwelt Wearing the diadem of righteousness, And robed in that respect which greatness wins When leagued with goodness, and by wisdom crown'd. The grateful prayers and blessings of the souls Ready to perish, silently distill'd Upon him, as he slept. So as a tree Whose root is by the river's brink, he grew And flourish'd, while the dews like balm-drops hung All night upon his branches. Yet let none Of woman born, presume to build his hopes On the worn cliff of brief prosperity, Or from the present promise, predicate The future joy. The exulting bird that sings Mid the green curtains of its leafy nest His tuneful trust untroubled there to live, And there to die, may meet the archer's shaft When next it spreads the wing. The tempest folds O'er the smooth forehead of the summer noon Its undiscover'd purpose, to emerge Resistless from its armory, and whelm In floods of ruin, ere the day decline. Lightning and sword! Swift messengers, and sharp, Reapers that leave no gleanings. In their path Silence and desolation fiercely stalk. âO'er trampled hills, and on the blood-stain'd plains There is no low of kine, or bleat of flocks, The fields are rifled, and the shepherds slain. The Man of Uz, who stood but yestermorn Above all compeers,âclothed with wealth and power, To day is poorer than his humblest hind. A whirlwind from the desert! All unwarn'd Its fury came. Earth like a vassal shook. Majestic trees flew hurtling through the air Like rootless reeds. There was no time for flight. Buried in household wrecks, all helpless lay Masses of quivering life. Job's eldest son That day held banquet for their numerous line At his own house. With revelry and song, One moment in the glow of kindred hearts The lordly mansion rang, the next they lay Crush'd neath its ruins. Heâthe childless sire, Last of his race, and lonely as the pine That crisps and blackens 'neath the lightning shaft Upon the cliff, with such a rushing tide The mountain billows of his misery came, Drove they not Reason from her beacon-hold? Swept they not his strong trust in Heaven away? List,âlist,âthe sufferer speaks. âThe Lord who gave Hath taken away,âand blessed be His name.â Oh Patriarch!âteach us, mid this changeful life Not to mistake the ownership of joys Entrusted to us for a little while, But when the Great Dispenser shall reclaim His loans, to render them with praises back, As best befits the indebted. Should a tear. Moisten the offering, He who knows our frame And well remembereth that we are but dust, Is full of pity. It was said of old Time conquer'd Grief. But unto me it seems That Grief overmastereth Time. It shows how wide The chasm between us, and our smitten joys And saps the strength wherewith at first we went Into life's battle. We perchance, have dream'd That the sweet smile the sunbeam of our home The prattle of the babe the Spoiler seiz'd, Had but gone from us for a little while,â And listen'd in our fallacy of hope At hush of eve for the returning step That wake the inmost pulses of the heart To extasy,âtill iron-handed Grief Press'd down the nevermore into our soul, Deadening us with its weight. The man of Uz As the slow lapse of days and nights reveal'd The desolation of his poverty Felt every nerve that at the first great shock Was paralyzed, grow sensitive and shrink As from a fresh-cut wound. There was no son To come in beauty of his manly prime With words of counsel and with vigorous hand To aid him in his need, no daughter's arm To twine around him in his weariness, Nor kiss of grandchild at the even-tide Going to rest, with prayer upon its lips. Still a new trial waits. The blessed health Heaven's boon, thro' which with unbow'd form we bear Burdens and ills, forsook him. Maladies Of fierce and festering virulence attack'd His swollen limbs. Incessant, grinding pains Laid his strength prostrate, till he counted life A loathed thing. Dire visions frighted sleep That sweet restorer of the wasted frame, And mid his tossings to and fro, he moan'd Oh, when shall I arise, and Night be gone! Despondence seized him. To the lowliest place Alone he stole, and sadly took his seat In dust and ashes. She, his bosom friend The sharer of his lot for many years, Sought out his dark retreat. Shuddering she saw His kingly form like living sepulchre, And in the maddening haste of sorrow said God hath forgotten. She with him had borne Unuttered woe o'er the untimely graves Of all whom she had nourished,âshared with him The silence of a home that hath no child, The plunge from wealth to want, the base contempt Of menial and of ingrate;âbut to see The dearest object of adoring love Her next to God, a prey to vile disease Hideous and loathsome, all the beauty marred That she had worshipped from her ardent youth Deeming it half divine, she could not bear, Her woman's strength gave way, and impious words In her despair she uttered. But her lord To deeper anguish stung by her defect And rash advice, reprovingly replied Pointing to Him who meeteth out below Both good and evil in mysterious love, And she was silenced. What a sacred power Hath hallow'd Friendship o'er the nameless ills That throng our pilgrimage. Its sympathy, Doth undergird the drooping, and uphold The foot that falters in its miry path. It grows more precious, as the hair grows grey. Time's alchymy that rendereth so much dross Back for our gay entrustments, shows more pure The perfect essence of its sanctity, Gold unalloyed. How doth the cordial grasp, Of hands that twined with ours in school days, now Delight us as our sunbeam nears the west, Soothing, perchance our self-esteem with proofs That 'mid all faults the good have loved us still, And quickening with redoubled energy To do or suffer. The three friends of Job Who in the different regions where they dwelt Teman, and Naamah and the Shuhite land, Heard tidings of his dire calamity, Moved by one impulse, journey'd to impart Their sorrowing sympathy. Yet when they saw Him fallen so low, so chang'd that scarce a trace Remained to herald his identity Down by his side upon the earth, they sate Uttering no language save the gushing tear,â Spontaneous homage to a grief so great. Oh Silence, born of Wisdom! we have felt Thy fitness, when beside the smitten friend We took our place. The voiceless sympathy The tear, the tender pressure of the hand Interpreted more perfectly than words The purpose of our soul. We speak to err, Waking to agony some broken chord Or bleeding nerve that slumbered. Words are weak, When God's strong discipline doth try the soul; And that deep silence was more eloquent Than all the pomp of speech. Yet the long pause Of days and nights, gave scope for troubled thought And their bewildered minds unskillfully Launching all helmless on a sea of doubt Explored the cause for which such woes were sent, Forgetful that this mystery of life Yields not to man's solution. Passing on From natural pity to philosophy That deems Heaven's judgments penal, they inferr'd Some secret sin unshrived by penitence, That drew such awful visitations down. While studying thus the wherefore, with vain toil Of painful cogitation, lo! a voice Hollow and hoarse, as from the mouldering tomb, âPerish the day in which I saw the light! The day when first my mother's nursing care Sheltered my helplessness. Let it not come Into the number of the joyful months, Let blackness stain it and the shades of death Forever terrify it. For it cut Not off as an untimely birth my span, Nor let me sleep where the poor prisoners hear No more the oppressor, where the wicked cease From troubling and the weary are at rest. Now as the roar of waves my sorrows swell, And sighs like tides burst forth till I forget To eat my bread. That which I greatly feared Hath come upon me. Not in heedless pride Nor wrapped in arrogance of full content I dwelt amid the tide of prosperous days, And yet this trouble came.â With mien unmoved The Temanite reprovingly replied: âWho can refrain longer from words, even though To speak be grief? Thou hast the instructor been Of many, and their model how to act. When trial came upon them, if their knees Bow'd down, thou saidst, âbe strong,â and they obey'd. But now it toucheth thee and thou dost shrink, And murmuring, faint. The monitor forgets The precepts he hath taught. Is this thy faith, Thy confidence, the uprightness of thy way? Whoever perish'd being innocent? And when were those who walk'd in righteous ways Cut off? How oft I've seen that those who sow The seeds of evil secretly, and plow Under a veil of darkness, reap the same. In visions of the night, when deepest sleep Falls upon men, fear seiz'd me, all my bones Trembled, and every stiffening hair rose up. A spirit pass'd before me, but I saw No form thereof. I knew that there it stood, Even though my straining eyes discern'd it not. Then from its moveless lips a voice burst forth, âIs man more just than God? Is mortal man More pure than He who made him? Lo, he puts No trust in those who serve him, and doth charge Angels with folly. How much less in them Dwellers in tents of clay, whose pride is crush'd Before the moth. From morn to eve they die And none regard it.â So despise thou not The chastening of the Almighty, ever just, For did thy spirit please him, it should rise More glorious from the storm-cloud, all the earth At peace with thee, new offspring like the grass Cheering thy home, and when thy course was done Even as a shock of corn comes fully ripe Into the garner should thy burial be Belov'd and wept of all.â Mournful arose The sorrowful response. âOh that my grief Were in the balance laid by faithful hands And feeling hearts. To the afflicted soul Friends should be comforters. But mine have dealt Deceitfully, as fails the shallow brook When summer's need is sorest. Did I say Bring me a gift? or from your flowing wealth Give solace to my desolate penury? Or with your pitying influence neutralize My cup of scorn poured out by abject hands? That thus ye mock me with contemptuous words And futile arguments, and dig a pit In which to whelm the man you call a friend? Still darkly hinting at some heinous sin Mysteriously concealed? Writes conscious guilt No transcript on the brow? Hangs it not out Its signal there, altho' it seem to hide 'Neath an impervious shroud? Look thro' the depths Of my unshrinking eye, deep, deep within. What see ye there? what gives suspicion birth? As longs the laborer for the setting sun, Watching the lengthening shadows that foretell The time of rest, yet day by day returns To the same task again, so I endure Wearisome nights and months of burdening woe. I would not alway live this loathed life Whose days are vanity. Soon shall I sleep Low in the dust, and when the morning comes And thro' its curtaining mists ye seek my face I shall not be.â Earnest the Shuhite spake, âHow long shall these thy words, like eddying winds Fall empty on the ear? Doth God pervert Justice and judgment? If thy way was pure, Thy supplication from an upright heart He would awake and make thy latter end More blest than thy beginning. For inquire Of ancient times, of History's honor'd scroll And of the grey-hair'd fathers, if our words Seem light, we who were born but yesterday. Ask them and they shall teach thee, as the rush, Or as the flag forsaken of the pod, So shall the glory of the hypocrite Fade in its greenness. Tho' his house may seem Awhile to flourish, it shall not endure. Even tho' he grasp it with despairing strength It shall deceive his trust and pass away, As fleets the spider's filmy web, Behold God will not cast away the perfect man Nor help the evil doer.â In low tones, Sepulchral, and with pain, the sufferer spake, âI know that this is truth, but how can man Be just with God? How shall he dare contend With Him who stretches out the sky and treads Upon the mountain billows of the sea, And sealeth up the stars? Array'd in strength, He passeth by me, but I see Him not. I hear His chariot wheels, yet fear to ask Where goest Thou? If I, indeed, were pure, And perfect, like the model ye see fit To press upon me with your sharpest words, I would not in mine arrogance arise And reason with Him, but all humbly make Petition to my Judge. If there were one To shield me from His terrors, and to stand As mediator, I might dare to ask Why didst Thou give this unrequested boon Of life, to me, unhappy? My few days Are swifter than a post. As the white sail Fades in the mist, as the strong eagle's wing Leaves no receding trace, they flee away, They see no good. Hath not Thy mighty hand Fashion'd and made this curious form of clay, Fenc'd round with bones and sinews, and inspired By a mysterious soul? Oh be not stern Against Thy creature, as the Lion marks His destin'd prey. Relent and let me take Comfort a little, ere I go the way Whence I return no more, to that far land Of darkness and the dreary shades of death.â Scarce had he ceas'd ere Zophar's turbid thoughts Made speed to answer. âShall a tide of talk Wash out transgression? If thou choose to set The truth at nought, must others hold their peace? Hast thou not boasted that thy deeds and thoughts Were perfect in the almighty Maker's sight? Canst thou by searching find out God? Behold Higher than heaven it is, what canst thou do? Deeper than deepest hell, what canst thou know? Why wilt thou ignorantly deem thyself Unblamed before Him? Oh that He would speak, And put to shame thine arrogance. His glance Discerns all wickedness, all vain pretence To sanctity and wisdom. Were thine heart Rightly prepared, and evil put away From that and from thy house, then shouldst thou lift Thy spotless face, clear as the noon-day sun Stedfast and fearless. Yea, thou shouldst forget Thy misery, as waters that have past Away forever. Thou shouldst be secure And dig about thee and take root, and rest, While those who scorn thee now, with soul abased, Should make their suit unto thee. But the eyes Of wicked men shall fail, and as the groan Of him who giveth up the ghost, shall be Their frustrate hope.â Dejectedly, as one Who wearied in a race, despairs to reach The destined goal, nor yet consents to leave His compeers masters of an unwon field. Job said,â âNo doubt ye think to have attained Monopoly of knowledge, and with you Wisdom shall die. This modesty of creed Befits ye well. Yet what have ye alledg'd Unheard before? what great discoveries made? Who knoweth not such things as ye have told? Despised am I by those who call'd me friend In prosperous days. Like a dim, waning lamp About to be extinguished am I held By the dull minds of those who dwell at ease. Weak reasoners that ye are, ye have essay'd To speak for God. Suppose ye He doth need Such advocacy? whose creative hand Holdeth the soul of every living thing, And breath of all mankind? He breaketh down, And who can build again? Princes and kings Are nothing in his sight. Disrobed of power Ceaseless they wander and He heedeth not. Those whom the world have worship'd seem as fools. He lifteth up the nations at His will, Or sweeps them with his lightest breath away Like noteless atoms. Silence is for you The truest wisdom. Creatures that ye count Inferior to yourselves, who in thin air Spread the light wing, or thro' the waters glide, Or roam the earth, might teach if ye would hear And be instructed by them. Hold your peace! Even tho' He slay me I will trust in Him For He is my salvation, He alone; At whose dread throne no hypocrite shall dare To stand, or answer. Man, of woman born Is of few days, and full of misery. Forth like a flower he comes, and is cut down, He fleeth like a shadow. What is man That God regardeth him? The forest tree Fell'd by the woodman may have hope to live And sprout again, and thro' the blessed touch Of waters at the root put forth new buds And tender branches like a plant. But man Shorn of his strength, doth waste away and die, He giveth up the ghost and where is he? As slides the mountain from its lieaving base Hurling its masses o'er the startled vale, As the rent rock resumes its place no more, As the departed waters leave no trace Save the groov'd channels where they held their course Among the fissur'd stones, his form of dust With its chang'd countenance, is sent away And all the honors that he sought to leave Behind him to his sons, avail him not.â He ceas'd and Eliphaz rejoin'd, âA man Of wisdom dealeth not in empty words That like the east wind stirs the unsettled sands To profitless revolt. Thou dost decry Our speech and proudly justify thyself Before thy God. He to whose searching eye Heavens' pure immaculate ether seems unclean. Ask of tradition, ask the white hair'd men Much older than thy father, since to us Thou deign'st no credence. Say they not to thee, All, as with one consent, the wicked man Travaileth with fruitless pain, a dreadful sound Forever in his ears; the mustering tramp Of hostile legions on the distant cloud, A far-off echo from the woe to come? Such is his lot who sinfully contends Against the just will of the Judging One, Lifting his puny arm in rebel pride And rushing like a madman on his doom. The wealth he may have gathered shall dissolve And turn to ashes mid devouring flame. His branch shall not be green, but as the vine Casteth her unripe grapes, as thro' the leaves Of rich and lustrous hue, the olive buds Untimely strew the ground, shall be his trust Who in the contumacy of his pride Would fain deceive both others and himself.â To whom, the Man of Uz,â âThese occult truths If such ye deem them, I have heard before; Oh miserable comforters! I too Stood but your soul in my soul's stead, could heap Vain, bitter words, and shake my head in scorn. But I would study to assuage your pain, And solace shed upon your stricken hearts With balm-drops of sweet speech. Yet, as for me, I speak and none regard, or drooping sit In mournful silence, and none heed my woe. They smite me on the cheek reproachfully, And slander me in secret, though my cause And witness rest with the clear-judging Heaven. My record is on high. Oh Thou, whose hand Hath thus made desolate all my company, And left me a poor, childless manâbehold They who once felt it pride to call me friend, Make of my name a by-word, which was erst Like harp or tabret to their venal lip. Mine eye is dim with grief, my wasted brow Furrow'd with wrinkles. Soon I go the way Whence I shall not return. The grave, my house, Is ready for me. In its mouldering clay My bed I make, and say unto the worm Thou art my sister.â With unpitying voice Not comprehending Job, the Shuhite spake. âHow long ere thou shalt make an end of words So profitless and vain? Thou dost account Us vile as beasts. But shall the stable earth With all its rocks and mountains be removed For thy good pleasure? See, the light forsake The wicked man. Darkness and loneliness Enshroud his dwelling-place. His path shall be Mid snares and traps, and his own counsel fail To guide him safely. By the heel, the gin Shall seize him, and the robber's hand prevail To rifle and destroy his treasure hoard. Secret misgivings feed upon his strength, And terrors waste his courage. He shall find In his own tabernacle no repose, Nor confidence. His withering root shall draw No nutriment, and the unsparing ax Cut off his branches. From a loathing world He shall be chased away, and leave behind No son or nephew to bear up his name Among the people. No kind memories Shall linger round his ashes, or refresh The hearts of men. They who come after him Shall be astonish'd at his doom, as they Who went before him, view'd it with affright. Such is the lot of those who know not God Or wickedly renounce Him.â Earnestly Replied the suffering man, âYe vex my soul And break it into pieces. These ten times Have ye reproach'd me, without sense of shame Or touch of sympathy. If I have err'd As without witness ye essay to prove 'Tis my concern, not yours. But yet, how vain To speak of wrong, or plead the cause of truth Before the unjust. Can ye not understand God in his wisdom hath afflicted me? His hand hath reft away my crown and stripp'd Me of my glory. Kindred blood vouchsafes No aid or solace in my deep distress. Estrang'd and far away, like statues cold Brethren and kinsfolk stand. Familiar friends Frown on me as a stranger. They who dwell In my own house and eat my bread, despise me. I call'd my own tried servant, but he gave No answer or regard. My maidens train'd For household service, to perform my will Count me an alien;âeven with my wife My voice hath lost its power. Young children rise And push away my feet and mock my words. Yea, the best loved, most garner'd in my heart Do turn against me as a thing abhorr'd. Have pity, pity on me, oh my friends! The hand of God hath smitten me. I know That my Redeemer liveth, and shall stand At last upon the earth, and though in death Worms shall destroy this body, in my flesh Shall I see God.â This glorious burst of faith Springing from depths of misery and pain Awed them a moment, like the lightning's flash, Cleaving the cloud. But gathering strength again, They sought the conflict. âThou, who art so wise, Hast thou not learn'd how baseless is the joy And boasting of the hypocrite? His head Up to the heavens in excellence and pride May seem to mount, yet shall he swiftly fall Leaving no trace. Though still he toils to keep His sin a secret from his fellow-men, Like a sweet, stolen morsel, hiding it Under his tongue, yet shall the veil be rent. God's fearful judgments shall make evident What he hath done in darkness. Vipers' tongues And the dire poison of the asp, shall be His recompense. Terrors shall strike him through, An inward fire of sharp remorse, unblown By mortal hand, shall on his vitals feed, And all his strength consume. His wealth shall fleet, And they who trusted to become his heirs Embrace a shadow, for his goods shall flow Away, as the false brook forsakes its sands. This is the portion of the hypocrite, The heritage appointed him by God.â To Zophar answered Job,â âHear ye my speech, And when 'tis done, mock on. Not unto man Is my complaint. For were it so, my heart Would sink in darker depths of hopeless woe. Say ye that earth's âprosperityâ rewards The righteous man? Why do the wicked live, Grow old, and magnify themselves in power? Their offspring flourish round them, their abodes Are safe from fear. Their cattle multiply And widely o'er the hills and pastures green Wander their healthful herds. Forth like a flock They send their little ones, with dance and song, Tabret and harp. They spend their days in wealth And sink to slumber in the quiet grave. Yet unto God they said, Depart from us, For we desire no knowledge of thy ways. Why should we serve the Almighty? Who is he? And what our profit if we pray to Him? Close by these impious ones lies down to sleep, One in the strength and glory of his prime, Whom sorrow never touch'd, nor age impair'd; And still another, wan misfortune's child, Nurtur'd in bitterness, who never took His meat with pleasure. Side by side they rest On Death's oblivious pillow. Do ye say Their varied lot below, mark'd their deserts? In retribution just? But as for you With eyes so sharp for your own selfish ends, Who by the wayside ask where'er ye go, âWhere is the dwelling of the prince? and seek Gain more than godliness, I know full well Your deep contempt for one too poor to bribe Your false allegiance, and the unkind device Ye wrongfully imagine. Will ye teach Knowledge to God? Doth He not wisely judge The highest? and reserve the sons of guilt For the destruction that awaiteth them?â In quick rejoinder, Eliphaz replied, âWhat is thy fancied goodness in the sight Of the Almighty? Is it gain to Him If thou art righteous? Would it add to Him Gladness or glory, that thy ways should be What thou call'st perfect? Rather turn thine eyes Upon the record of thy sins, and see Their countless number. Hast thou taken a pledge From thy poor brother's hand? or rest away Like ravening beasts. There are, who watch to slay, Rising before the dawn, or wrapp'd in night Roaming with stealthy footstep, as a thief, To smite their victims, while the wounded groan Struck by their fatal shaft. There are, who do Such deeds of utter darkness as detest The gaze of day. Muffling their face, they dig Their way to habitations where they leave Shame and dishonor. Though He seem to sleep, God's eye is on their ways. A little while They wrap themselves in secret infamy, Or proudly flourish,âbut as the tall tree Yields in a moment to the wrecking blast, As 'neath the sickle falls the crisping corn, Shall they be swept away, and leave no trace.â Bildad, the Shuhite, rose in act to speak. âDominion is with God, and fear. He makes Peace in his own high places. Dost thou know The number of His armies? Or on whom His light ariseth not? How then can man Be justified with God? or he be pure Born of a woman. Lo! the cloudless Moon, And yon unsullied stars, are in His sight Dim and impure. Can man who is a worm Be spotless with his Maker?â Hark, the voice Of the afflicted man: âHow dost thou help Him that is powerless? how sustain the arm That fails in strength? how counsel him who needs Wisdom? and how declare the righteous truth Just as it is? To Him who reads the soul, Hades is naked, and the realms of Death Have naught to cover them. This pendent Earth Hangs on this word,âin gathering clouds he binds The ponderous waters, till at his command They rend their filmy prison. Day and night Await his nod to run their measured course. Heaven's pillars and its everlasting gates Tremble at his reproof. The cleaving sea And man's defeated pride confess his power. Yet the same Hand that garnisheth the skies Disdaineth not to fashion and sustain The crooked serpent. But how small a part Of all its works are understood by us Dim dwellers in this lowly vestibule, And by the thunders of mysterious power Still held in awe. As the Eternal lives Who hath bow'd down my soul, as long as breath Inspires this mortal frame, these lips shall ne'er Utter deceit, nor cast away the wealth Of a good conscience. While I live I'll hold Fast mine integrity,ânor justify The slanderous charges of a secret guilt Ye bring against me. For what is the gain Of the base hypocrite when God shall take Away his perjured soul? Yourselves have seen How often in this life the wicked taste Of retribution. The oppressor bears Sway for a while,âbut look!âthe downfall comes. His offspring shall not flourish, nor his grave Be wet with widow's tears. The unjust rich man Heapeth up silver for a stranger's hand, He hoardeth raiment with a miser's greed To robe he knows not who, though he himself Had grudg'd to wear it. Boastfully he builds A costly mansion to preserve his name Among the people. But like the slight booth, Brief lodge of summer, shall it pass away. Terrors without a cause, disable him And drown his courage. Like a driven leaf Before the whirlwind, shall he hasten down To a dishonord tomb. Men shall rejoice, And clap their hands, and hiss him from his place When he departs. Surely, there is a vein For silver, and a secret bed for gold Which man discovers. Where the iron sleeps In darkest chambers of the mine he knows, And how the brass is molten. But a Mind Deeper than his, close-hidden things explores, Searching out all perfection. Earth unveils The mystic treasures of her matron breast, Bread for her children, gems like living flame, Sapphires, whose azure emulates the skies, And dust of gold. Yet there's a curtain'd path Which the unfettered denizens of air Have not descried, nor even the piercing eye Of the black vulture seen. The lion's whelps In their wide roaming, nor their fiercer sire Have never trod it. There's a Hand that bares The roots of mountains at its will, and cuts Through rifted rocks a channel, where the streams And rivers freely flowâan Eye that scans Each precious thing. But where doth Wisdom dwell? And in what curtain'd chamber was the birth Of Understanding? The great Sea uplifts Its hand in adjuration, and declares â'Tis not with me,â and its unfathom'd deep In subterranean thunders, echoing cry âNo, not with me.â Offer ye not for them Silver, or Ophir's gold, nor think to exchange Onyx, or sapphire, or the coral branch Or crystal gem where hides imprison'd light, Nor make ye mention of the precious pearl Or Ethiopian topaz, for their price Transcendeth, rubies, or the dazzling ray Of concentrated jewels. In what place Are found these wondrous treasures? Who will show Their habitation? which alike defies The ken of those who soar, or those who delve In cells profound. Death and destruction say, From their hoarse caverns, âWe have heard their fame But know them not.â Lo! He who weighs the winds Measures the floods, controls the surging sea And points the forked lightnings where to play, He, unto whom all mysteries are plain All secrets open, all disguises clear, Saith unto man the questioner,â âBehold The fear of God is wisdom, and to break The sway of evil and depart from sin Is understanding.â Anguish wrings my soul As in my hours of musing I restore The picture of my lost prosperity, When round my side my loving children drew And from my happy home my steps were hail'd Where'er I went. The fatherless and poor, And he who had no helper, welcomed me As one to right their wrongs, and pluck the spoil From the oppressor's teeth. Pale widows raised The glistening eye of gratitude, and they Whose sight was quench'd, at my remembered tones Pour'd blessings on me. Overflowing wealth Brought me no titles that I held so dear As father of the poor, and comforter Of all who mourn. When in the gate I sate The nobles did me honor, and the wise Sought counsel of me. To my words the young Gave earnest heed, the white-hair'd men stood up, And princes waited for my speech, as wait The fields in summer for the latter rain. But now, the children of base men spring up And push away my feet, and make my name A bye-word and a mockery, which was erst Set to the harp in song. Because my wealth God hath resumed, they who ne'er dared to claim Equality with even the lowest ones Who watch'd my flock, they whom my menials scorned, Dwellers in hovels, feeding like the brutes On roots and bushes of the wilderness, Despise me, and in mean derision cast Marks of abhorrence at the fallen chief Whom erst they fear'd. Unpitied I endure Sickness and pain that ope the narrow house Where all the living go. My soul dissolves And flows away as waterâlike the owl In lone, forgotten cavern I complain, For all my instruments of music yield But mournful sounds, and from my organ comes A sob of weeping. I appeal to Him Who sees my ways, and all my steps doth count, If I have walk'd with vanity or worn The veil of falsehood, or despised to obey The law of duty; if I basely prowl'd With evil purpose round my neighbor's door, Or scorn'd my humblest menial's cause to right When he contended with me, and complain'd, Framed as he was of the same clay with me By the same Hand Divine; or shunn'd to share Even my last morsel with the hungry poor, Or shield the uncovered suppliant with the fleece Of my own cherish'd flock. If ere I made Fine gold my confidence, or lifted up My heart in pride, because my wealth was great, Or when I saw the glorious King of Day Gladdening all nations, and the queenly Moon Walking in brightness, was enticed to pay A secret homage,â'twere idolatry Unpardonably great. If I rejoided In the affliction of mine enemy Or for his hatred breathed a vengeful vow When trouble came upon him,âif I closed The inhospitable door against the foot Of stranger, or of traveller,âor withheld Full nutriment from any who abode Within my tabernacle,âor refused Due justice even to my own furrow'd field, Then let my harvest unto thistles turn, And rootless weeds o'ertop the beardless grain.â Then ceased the Man of Uz, like one o'erspent, Feeling the fallacy of argument With auditors like these, his thoughts withdrew Into the shroud of silence, and he spake No more unto them, standing fix'd and mute, Like statued marble. Then, as none replied, A youthful stranger rose, and while he stretch'd His hand in act to speak, and heavenward raised His clear, unshrinking brow, he worthy seem'd To hold the balance of that high debate. Still, an indignant warmth, with energy Of fervid eloquence his lips inspired. ââI said that multitude of days should bring Wisdom to man, and so gave earnest heed To every argument. And lo! not one Of all your speeches have convicted Job, Or proved your theory that woes like his Denote a secret guilt. I listened still With that respect which youth doth owe to age, And till ye ceased to speak, refrain'd to show Mine own opinion. But there is a breath From the Almighty, that gives life to thought, And in my soul imprison'd utterance burns Like torturing flame. So, will I give it vent Though I am young in years, and ye are old, And should be wise. I will not shun to uphold The righteous cause, nor will I gloze the wrong With flattering titles, lest the kindling wrath Of an offended Maker, sweep me hence. Hearken, O Job, I pray thee, to my words For they are words of truth. Thou hast assumed More perfect innocence than appertains To erring man, and eager to refute False accusation hast contemn'd the course Of the All-Merciful. Why shouldst thou strive With Him whose might of wisdom ne'er unveils Its mysteries to man? Yet doth He deign Such hints and precepts as the docile heart May comprehend. Sometimes in vision'd sleep, His Spirit hovereth o'er the plastic mind Sealing instruction. Or a different voice Its sterner teaching tries. His vigor droops, Strong pain amid the multitude of bones Doth revel, till his soul abhorreth meat. His fair flesh wastes, and downward to the pit He hourly hastens. Holy Sympathy May aid to uphold him in its blessed arms Kindly interpreting the Will Divine, With angel tenderness. But if the God Whose gracious ear doth hear the sigh of prayer Baptized with dropping tearsâperceives the cry Of humbled self-abasing penitence, He casts away the scourgeâthe end is gained. Fresh as a child's, the wither'd flesh returns, And life, and health, and joy, are his once more. With discipline like this, He often tries The creatures He hath made, to crush the seeds Of pride, and teach that lowliness of soul Befitting them, and pleasing in His sight. Oh Man of Uzâif thou hast aught to add Unto thy argumentâI pray thee, speak! Fain would I justify thee. Is it well To combat Him who hath the right to reign? Or even to those who fill an earthly throne And wear a princely diadem, to say, Ye are unjust? But how much less to Him The fountain of all power, who heedeth not Earth's vain distinctions, nor regards the rich More than the poor, for all alike are dust And ashes in His sight. Is it not meet For those who bear His discipline, to say I bow submissive to the chastening Hand That smites my inmost soul? Oh teach me that Which through my blindness I have failed to see, For I have sinn'd, but will offend no more. Say, is it right, Oh Job, for thee to hold Thyself superior to the All-Perfect Mind? If thou art righteous what giv'st thou to Him Who sits above the heavens? Can He receive Favor from mortals? Open not thy mouth To multiply vain words, but rather bow Unto the teaching of His works that spread So silently around. His snows descend And make the green Earth hoary. Chains of frost Straighten her breadth of waters. Dropping rains Refresh her summer thirst, or rending clouds Roll in wild deluge o'er her. Roaming beasts Cower in their dens affrighted, while she quakes Convuls'd with inward agony, or reels Dizzied with flashing fires. Again she smiles In her recovered beauty, at His will, Maker of all things. So, He rules the world, With wrath commingling mercy. Who may hope With finite mind to understand His ways, So excellent in power, in wisdom deep, In justice terrible, respecting none Who pride themselves in fancied wisdom.â Hark! On the discursive speech a whirlwind breaks, Tornadoes shake the desert, thunders roll And from the lightning's startled shrine, a voice! The voice of the Eternal. âWho is this That darkeneth knowledge by unmeaning words? Gird up thy loins and answer. Where wert thou When the foundations of the earth were laid? Who stretch'd the line, and fix'd the corner-stone, When the bright morning-stars together sang And all the hosts that circle round the Throne Shouted for joy? Whose hand controll'd the sea When it brake forth to whelm the new-fram'd world? Who made dark night its cradle and the cloud Its swaddling-band? commanding âHitherto Come, but no further. At this line of sand Stay thy proud waves.â Hast thou call'd forth the morn From the empurpled chambers of the east, Or bade the trembling day-spring know its place? Have Orion's depths been open'd to thy view? And hast thou trod his secret floor? or seen The gates of Death's dark shade? Where doth light dwell? And ancient Darkness, that with Chaos reign'd Before Creation? Dost thou know the path Unto their house, because thou then wert born? And is the number of thy days so great? Show me the treasure-house of snows. Unlock The mighty magazines of hail, that wait The war of elements. Who hath decreed A water-course for embryo fountain springs? Mark'd out the lightning's path and bade the rain O'erlook not in its ministries the waste And desolate plain, but wake the tender herb To cheer the bosom of the wilderness. Tell me the father of the drops of dew, The curdling ice, and hoary frost that seal The waters like a stone, and change the deep To adamant. Bind if thou canst, the breath And balmy influence of the Pleiades. Bring forth Mazzaroth in his time, or guide Arcturus, with his sons. Canst thou annul The fix'd decree that in their spheres detain The constellations? Will the lightnings go Forth on thine errands, and report to thee As loyal vassals? Who in dying clay Infused the immortal principle of mind, And made them fellow-workers? If thou canst Number the flying clouds, and gather back Their falling showers, when parch'd and cleaving earth Implores their charity. Wilt hunt the prey With the stern forest-king? or dare invade The darkened lair where his young lions couch Ravenous with hunger? Who the ravens feeds When from the parent's nest hurl'd out, they cry And all forsaken, ask their meat from God? Know'st thou the time when the wild goats endure The mother-sorrow? how their offspring grow Healthful and strong, uncared for, and unstall'd? Who made the wild ass like the desert free, Scorning the rein, and from the city's bound Turning triumphant to the wilderness? Lead to thy crib the unicorn, and bind His unbow'd sinews to the furrowing plough, And trust him if thou canst to bring thy seed Home to the garner. Who the radiant plumes Gave to the peacock? or the winged speed That bears the headlong ostrich far beyond The baffled steed and rider? not withheld By the instinctive tenderness that chains The brooding bird, she scatters on the sands Her unborn hopes, regardless though the foot May trampling crush them. Hast thou given the Horse His glorious strength, and clothed his arching neck With thunder? At the armed host he mocks,â The rattling quiver, and the glittering spear. Prancing and proud, he swalloweth the ground With rage, and passionate desire to rush Into the battle. At the trumpet's sound, And shouting of the captains, he exults, Drawing the stormy terror with delight Into his fearless spirit. Doth the Hawk In her migrations counsel ask of Thee? Mounts the swift Eagle up at thy command? Making her nest among the star-girt cliffs, And thence undazzled by the vertic sun Scanning the molehills of the earth, or motes That o'er her bosom move. Say,âwilt thou teach Creative Wisdom? or contend with Him The Almighty,âordering all things at His will?â Then there was silence, till the chastened One Murmured as from the dust, âLo, I am vile! What shall I answer thee?âI lay my hand Upon my mouth. Once have I dared to speak, But would be silent now, forevermore.â âYet still in thunder, from the whirlwind's wing, Jehovah's voice demanded,â âWilt thou dare To disannul my judgments? and above Unerring wisdom, and unbounded power Exalt thine own? Hast thou an arm like mine? Array thyself in majesty, and look On all the proud in heart, and bring them low,â Yea, deck thyself with glory, cast abroad The arrows of thine anger, and abase The arrogant, and send the wicked down To his own place, sealing his face like stone Deep in the dust; for then will I confess Thy might, and that thine own right hand hath power To save thyself. Hast seen my Behemoth, Who on the grassy mountains finds his food? And 'neath the willow boughs, and reeds, disports His monstrous bulk? His bones like brazen bars, His iron sinews cased in fearful strength Resist attack! Lo! when he slakes his thirst The rivers dwindle, and he thinks to draw The depths of Jordan dry. Wilt cast thy hook And take Leviathan? Wilt bind thy yoke Upon him, as a vassal? Will he cringe Unto thy maidens? See the barbed spear The dart and the habergeon, are his scorn. Sling-stones are stubble, keenest arrows foil'd, And from the plaited armor of his scales The glittering sword recoils. Where he reclines, Who is so daring as to rouse him up, With his cold, stony heart, and breath of flame? Or to the cavern of his gaping jaws Thick set with teeth, draw near? The Hand alone That made him can subdue his baleful might.â Jehovah ceas'd,âfor the Omniscient Eye That scans the inmost thought of man, discern'd Its work completed in that lowliness Of deep humility which fits the soul For heavenly intercourse, and renovates The blessed image of obedient love That Eden forfeited. Out of the depths Of true contrition sigh'd a trembling tone In utter abnegation, âI repent! In dust and ashes. I abhor myself.â âThus the returning prodigal who cries Unclothed and empty, âFather! I have sinn'd, And am not worthy to be called thy son,â Finds full forgiveness, and a free embrace, While the best robe his shrinking form enfolds. But with this self-abasement toward his God Job mingled tenderest regard for man. No longer with indignant warmth he strove Against his false accusers, or retained Rankling remembrance of the enmity That vexed his wounded soul With earnest prayers And offerings, he implored offended Heaven To grant forgiveness to those erring friends, Paying with love the alienated course Of their misguided minds. Heaven heard his voice, And with that intercession sweet, return'd The sunbeams of his lost prosperity. Back came his buried joys. They had no power To harm a soul subdued. The refluent tide Of wealth swept o'er him. On his many hills Gathered the herds, and o'er his pastures green Sported the playful lambs. The tuneful voice Of children fill'd his desolate home with joy, And round his household board their beauty gleam'd, Making his spirit glad. So full of days, While twice our span of threescore years and ten, Mark'd out its silvery chronicle of moons Still to his knee his children's children climb'd To hear the wisdom he had learned of God Through the strong teaching both of joy and woe. Nor had this sublunary scene alone, Witness'd his trial. Doubt ye not that forms To earth invisible were hovering near With the sublime solicitude of Heaven. For he, the bold, bad Spirit, in his vaunting pride Of impious revolt, had dared to say Unto the King of Kings, âStretch forth thy hand And take away all that he hath, and Job Will curse Thee to Thy face.â Methinks we hear An echo of angelic harmony From that blest choir who struck their harps with joy That from the Tempter's ordeal he had risen An unhurt victor. Round the Throne they pour'd Their gratulations that the born of clay Tho' by that mystery bow'd which ever veils The inscrutable counsels of the All-Perfect One, Might with the chieftain of the Rebel Host Cope unsubdued and heavenward hold his way. THE RURAL LIFE IN NEW-ENGLAND. INTRODUCTION. It may be thought that the following poem, especially its opening Canto is too minute and circumstantial in its descriptions. Yet the habitudes of a past and peculiar generation, fast fading from remembrance, are worthy of being preserved, though little accordant with romance, perhaps with poetry. So rapid has been our progress as a people, that dimness gathers over the lineaments of even our immediate ancestry. Yet traits at one period despised, or counted obsolete, may at another be diligently sought after and re-juvenated. It has been observed that nations reaching their zenith, regard with more complacency their rising morn, than the approaching west. France, notwithstanding the precision given to her language by Richilieu, and the Academy, turns back affectionately to her Troubadours and Trouvires, to the long-drawn, scarce-readable âRomance of the Rose,â and the itinerant Chronicles of Froissart. England is not indifferent to Anglo-Saxon traditions, or the customs of her Normann dynasty. A time may arrive when our posterity will not scorn to be reminded of the primitive usages of their rural fathers. To that time, and to unborn readers, this simple poem is dedicated. L. H. S. CANTO FIRST. Peaceful is the rural life, made strong by healthful industry, Firm in love of the birth-land, and the laws that govern it, Calm through moderated desires and a primitive simplicity, Walking filially with Nature as the Patriarchs walked with God. Such have I beheld it in my native vales, green and elmshaded. Such hath it been depicted in their legends who went before me; What therefore, I have seen and heard, declare I unto you In measures artless and untuneful. Fearless of hardship, In costume, as in manners, unadorn'd and homely Were our ancestral farmers, the seed-planters of a strong nation. Congenial were their wives, not ashamed of the household charge, Yoke-fellows that were help-meets, vigorous and of a good courage; Revolting not at life's plain intent, but its duties discharging Patiently, lovingly, and with true faith looking upward Thence came the rudiments of an inflexible people Whose praise is in themselves. Hail to the ancient farmer! Broad-shouldered as Ajaxâdeep-chested through commerce with free air, Not enervated by luxury, nor care-worn with gold-counting, Content with his lot, by pride and envy unvisited. Muscular was his arm, laying low the kings of the forest, Uncouth might be his coat, and his heavy shoes, Vestris flouted, At the grasp of his huge hand, the dainty belle might have shuddered. Yet blessings on his bronzed face, and his warm, honest heart, Whose well-rooted virtues were the strength and stay of republics. True independence was his, earth and sky being his bankers, Bills drawn on them, endorsed by toil were never protested. Bathed in vernal dews was his glistening plough-share, Birds, newly-returned, the merry nest-builders, bade him good morrow, Keenly wrought his scythe in summer, where fell the odorous clover, Clear was his song at autumn-husking amid piles of golden corn. Winter saw him battling the drifted snows, with his oxen, Bearing to the neighboring town, fuel that gladden'd the hearth-stone. Deep in undisturbed beds then slept the dark-featured anthracite, Steam not having armed itself to exterminate the groves, Lavishly offering them as a holocaust to winged horses of iron, Like Moloch, cruel god, dooming the beautiful to the flame. Independent was the farmer, the food of his household being sure; With the fields of waving grain; with the towering tassell'd maize; With the herds, moving homeward, bearing their creamy nectar He saw, and gather'd it, giving thanks to the bountiful Father. Among the lambs sporting in green pastures, among the feathery people, Among the fruit-laden branches, he beheld it also; Under the earth, on the earth, in the air, ripen'd his three-fold crop. Swelling in the cluster'd vine, and the roots of the teeming garden, The Gardenâprecious spot! which God deign'd to bless at the beginning, Placing therein Man, made after his own glorious image, To dress it and to keep it. Hail, to the ancient farmer, Naught to him the fall of stocks that turns pale the speculator, Naught to him the changes of trade, wrinkling the brow of the merchant, Naught to him, the light weight, or exorbitant price of the baker; Sure was his bread, howsoe'er the markets might fluctuate, Sweet loaves of a rich brown, plentifully graced his table, Made by the neat hand of wife or daughter, happy in healthful toil. Skilfully wrought the same hands, amid the treasures of the dairy, Rich cheeses, and masses of golden butter, and bowls of fragrant milk Not doled out warily, as by city dames, but to all, free and flowing; Woman's right it was, to crown the board with gifts of her own preparing; Rights not disputed, not clamored for in public assemblies, But conceded by approving Love, whose manliness threw around her A cherishing protection, such as God willed in Paradise. Dense was the head of the Maple, and in summer of a lustrous green, Yet earliest in autumn, among all trees of the forest, To robe itself in scarlet, like a cardinal going to conclave. Subjected was it in spring, to a singular phlebetomy; Tubes inserted through its bark, drew away the heart's sweet blood, Pore after pore emptying itself, till the great arteries were exhausted. Fires then blazed amid the thickets, like the moveable camp of the gipsies, And in boiling kettles, fiercely eddying, struggled the caloric, With gases, and the saccharine spirit, until the granulated sugar, Showed a calm, brown face, welcome to the stores of the housewife; Moulded also into small cakes, it formed the favorite confection Of maiden and swain, during the long evenings of courtship. Gamboling among wild flowers, gadded the honey-bee, Bending down their innocent heads, with a buzzing lore of flattery, Beguiling them of their essences, which with tireless alacrity, Straightway deposited he in his cone-roof'd banking-house, Subtle financierâthinking to take both dividend and capital. But failing in his usury, for duly cometh the farmer, Despoiling him of his hoard, yea! haply of his life also. Stern was the policy of the olden times, to that diligent insect, Not skill'd like our own, to confiscate a portion of his earnings, Leaving life and limb unscathed for future enterprise. Welcome were the gifts of that winged chemist to a primitive people. Carefully cloistered in choice vases, was the pure, virgin honey, Sacred to honor'd guests, or a balm to the sore-throated invalid. Dealt out charily, was the fair comb to the gratified little ones, Or, to fermentation yielded, producing the spirited metheglin. Not scorn'd by the bee-masters, were even those darken'd hexagons Where slumber'd the dead like the coral-builders in reefy cell. Even these to a practical use devoted the clear-sighted matron, Calling forth from cavernous sepulchres cheerful light for the living. Cleansed and judiciously mingled with an oleagenous element, Thus drew she from the mould, waxen candles, whose gold-tinted beauty Crown'd proudly the mantel-piece, reserved for bettermost occasions. Unheard of, then, was the gas, with briliant jet and gorgeous chandelier, Nor hunted they from zone to zone, with barbed harpoon the mighty whale, Making the indignant monarch of ocean, their flambeau and link-boy: For each household held within itself, its own fountain of light. Faithful was the rural housewife, taking charge of all intrusted things, Prolonging the existence of whatever needed repair, Requiring children to respect the property of their parents, Not to waste or destroy, but be grateful for food and clothing; Teaching them industry, and the serious value of fleeting time, Strict account of which must be rendered to the Master and Giver of Life. Prudence was then held in esteem and a laudable economy Not jeered at by miserly names, but held becoming in all, For the poor, that they might avoid debt; and the rich that they might be justly generous. Ho! for the flax-field, with its flower of blue and leaf freshly green,â Ho! for the snowy fleece, which the quiet flock yield to their master,â Woman's hand shall transmute both, into armor for those she loves, Wrapping her household in comfort, and her own heart in calm content. Hark! at her flaxen distaff cheerily singeth the matron, Hymns, that perchance, were mingled with her own cradle melodies. Back and forth, at the Great Wheel, treadeth the buxom damsel, Best form of calisthenics, exercising well every muscle Regularly and to good-purpose, filling the blue veins with richer blood. Rapidly on the spindle, gather threads from the pendent roll, Not by machinery anatomized, till stamina and staple fly away, But with hand-cards concocted, and symmetrically formed, Of wool, white or grey, or the refuse flax smoothed to a silky lustre, It greeteth the fingers of the spinner. In this Hygeian concert Leader of the Orchestra, was the Great Wheel's tireless tenor, Drowning the counter of the snapping reel, and the quill-wheels fitful symphony, Whose whirring strings, yielded to children's hands, prepare spools for the shuttle. At intervals, like a muffled drum, sounded the stroke of the loam, Cumbrous, and filling a large space with its quantity of timber, Obedient only to a vigorous arm, which in ruling it grew more vigorous. From its massy beam were unrolled, fabrics varied and substantial, Linen for couch and table, and the lighter garniture of summer, Frocks of a flaxen color for the laborer, or striped with blue for the younglings; Stout garments in which man bides the buffet of wintry elements. From the rind of the stately butternut, drew they a brown complexion, Or the cerulean borrowed from the tint of the southern indigo. Thus rustic Industry girded itself, amid household music, As History of old, set her fabulous legends to the harp. Ears trained to the operas of Italy, would find discordance to be mocked at, But the patriot heard the ring of gold in the coffers of his country, Not sent forth to bankruptcy, for the flowery silks of France; While the listening christian caught the strong harmonies of a peaceful Land, Giving praise to Jehovah. Lo! at the winter evening In these uncarpeted dwellings, what a world of comfort! Large hickory logs send a dancing flame up the ample chimney, Tinging with ruddy gleam, every face around the broad hearth-stone. King and patriarch, in the midst, sitteth the true-hearted farmer. At his side, the wife with her needle, still quietly regardeth the children. Sheltered in her corner-nook, in the arm-chair, the post of honor, Calm with the beauty of age, is the venerable grandmother. Clustering around her, watching the stocking that she knits, are the little ones, Loving the stories that she tells of the days when she was a maiden, Stories ever mix'd with lessons of a reverent piety. Manna do they thus gather to feed on, when their hair is hoary. Stretch'd before the fire, is the weary, rough-coated house-dog, Winking his eyes, full of sleep, at the baby, seated on his shoulder, Proudly watching his master's darling, and the pet of the family, As hither and thither on its small feet it toddles unsteadily. On the straight-back'd oaken settle, congregate the older children. Work have they, or books, and sometimes the weekly newspaper, Grey, on coarse, crumpled paper, and borrowed from house to house, Small-sized, yet precious, and read through from beginning to end, Bright, young heads circling close, peering together over its columns. Now and then, furtive glances reconnoitre the ingle-side, Where before a bed of coals, rows of red apples are roasting, Spitting out their life-juices spitefully, in unwilling martyrdom. Finished, and drawn back, the happy group wait a brief interval Thinking some neighbor might chance to come in and bid them good even, Heightening their simple refection, for whose sake would be joyously added The mug of sparkling cider passed temperately from lip to lip, Sufficient and accepted offering of ancient, true-hearted hospitality. Thus in colonial times dwelt they together as brethren, Taking part in each others' concerns with an undissembled sympathy. But when the tall old clock told out boldly three times three, Thrice the number of the graces, thrice the number of the fates, The full number of the Muses, the hour dedicated to Morpheus, At that curfew, departed the guest, and all work being suspended, Laid aside was the grandmother's knitting-bag, for in its cradle Rock'd now and then by her foot, already slumbered the baby. Then, ere the fading brands were covered with protecting ashes, Rose the prayer of the Sire, amid his treasured and trusted ones, Rose his thanks for past blessings, his petitions for the future, His committal of all care to Him who careth for his creatures, Overlooking nothing that His bountiful Hand hath created. Orderly were the households of the farmer, not given to idle merriment, Honoring the presence of parents, as of tutelary spirits. To be obedient and useful were the first lessons of the young children, Well learned and bringing happiness, that ruled on sure foundations, Respect for authority, being the initial of God's holy fear. Modern times might denounce such a system as tyrannical, Asking the blandishments of indulgence, and a broader liberty; Leaving in perplexing doubt, the mind of the infant stranger Whether to rule or to be ruled he came hither on his untried journey, Rearing him in headstrong ignorance, revolting at discipline, Heady, high-minded, and prone to speak evil of dignities. Welcome was Winter, to the agriculturist of olden times, Then, while fruitful Earth, with whom he was in league, held her sabbath, Knowledge entered into his soul. At the lengthened evening, Read he in an audible voice to his listening family Grave books of History, or elaborate Theology, Taxing thought and memory, but not setting fancy on tiptoe Teaching reverence for wise men, and for God, the Giver of Wisdom. Not then had she era arrived, when of making books there is no end. Painfully the laboring press, brought forth like the kingly whale One cub at a time, guiding it carefully over the billows, Watching with pride and pleasure, its own wonderful offspring. A large, fair volume, was in those days, as molten gold, Touched only with clean hands, and by testators willed to their heirs. Winter also, brought the school for the boys,âreleased from farm-labor. Early was the substantial breakfast, in those short, frosty mornings, That equipped in season, might be the caravan for its enterprise, Punctuality in those simple times being enrolled among the virtues. There they go! a rosy group, bearing in small baskets their dinner; Plunging thro' all snow-drifts, the boys,âon all ices sliding the girls, Yet leaving not the straight path, lest tardy should be their arrival. Lone on the bleak hill-side, stood the unpainted village school-house, Winds taking aim at it like a target, smoke belching from its chimney, Base to the fiery suns of summer, like the treeless Nantucket. Desks were ranged under the windows where on high benches without backs Sate the little ones, their feet vainly reaching toward the distant floor, Commanded everlastingly to keep still and to be still, As if immobility were the climax of all excellence; Hard lesson for quick nerves, and eyes searching for something new. Nature endowed them with curiosity, but man wiser than she Calling himself a teacher, would fain stiffen them into statues. No bright visions of the school-palaces of future days With seats of ease, and carpets, and pianos, and pictured walls, And green lawns, pleasantly shaded, stretching wide for play, And knowledge fondling her pets, and unveiling her royal road, Gleam'd before them as Eden, kindling smiles on their thoughtful faces. Favor'd were the elder scholars with more congenial tasks: Loudly read they in their classes, glorying in the noise they made, Busily over the slates moved the hard pencils, with a grating sound, Diligently on coarse paper wrote they, with quill pens, bushy topp'd, Blessed in having lived, ere the metallic stylus was invented. Rang'd early around the fire, have been their frozen ink-stands, Where in rotation sits each scholar briefly, by the master's leave, Roasting on one side, and on the other a petrefaction, Keen blasts through the crevices delighting to whistle and mock them. Patient were the children, not given to murmuring or complaining, Learning through privation, lessons of value for a future life, Subjection, application, and love of knowledge for itself alone. On a high chair, sate the solemn Master, watchful of all things, Absolute was his sway and in this authority he gloried, Conforming it much to the Spartan rule, and the code of Solomon, Showing no mercy to idleness, or wrong uses of the slippery tongue: Yet to diligent students kind, and of their proficiency boastful, Exhibiting their copy-books, to committee-man and visitant, Or calling out the declaimers, in some stentorian dialogue. Few were the studies then pursued, but thoroughness required in all, Surface-work not being in vogue, nor rootless blossoms regarded. Especially well-taught was the orthography of our copious language, False spelling being as a sin to be punished by the judges. In this difficult attainment the master sometimes accorded A form of friendly conflict sought with ardor as a premium, Stirring the belligerent element, ever strong in boyish natures. Forth came at close of the school-day, two of reproachless conduct, Naming first the best spellers, they proceeded to choose alternately, Till all, old and young, ranging under opposite banners, Drawn up as in battle array, each other stoutly confronted. Rapidly given out by the leaders to their marshall'd forces, Word by word, with its definition, was the allotted lesson, Vociferously answered from each side like discharges of artillery; Fatal was the slightest mistake, fatal even pause or hesitation, Doubt was for the vanquished, to deliberate was to be lost. Drooping with disgrace down sate each discomfited pupil, Bravely stood the perfect, the most unbroken line gaining the victory Not unboastful were the conquerers, cheered with shouts on their homeward way, Crest-fallen were the defeated, yet eager for a future contest. Strong elements thus enlisted, gave new vigor to mental toil, As the swimmer puts forth more force till the rapids are overpast. Dear to the persevering, were those schools of the olden time, Respected were the teachers, who with majestic austerity, Dispensed without favoritism, a Lacedamonian justice. Learning was not then loved for luxury, like a lady for her gold, But testing her worshippers by trial, knew who sought her for herself. Not given to frequent feasting was the home-bred farmer of New England, Parties, and the popular lectures swelled not his code of enjoyments. One banquet, climax of his convivial delight, was the yearly thanksgiving, Substituted by puritan settlers for the Christmas of the Mother-Clime, Keeping in memory the feast of ingathering, of the Ancient Covenant People; Drear November was its appointed season, when earth's bounty being garnered, Man might rest from his labors, and praise the Lord of the Harvest. Such was its original design, but the tendencies of Saxonism, Turn'd it more to eating and drinking, than devotional remembrance. Yet blessed was the time, summoning homeward every wanderer: Back came the city apprentice, and from her service place the damsel, Back came the married daughter to the father's quiet hearthstone, Wrapped warmly in her cloak is a babe, its eyes full of wonder,â Hand in hand, walked the little ones, bowing low before the grandparents, Meekly craving their blessing, for so had they been piously taught. Back to the birth-spot, to the shadow of their trees ancestral, Came they like joyous streams, to their first untroubled fountain, Knowing better how to prize it, from the rocks that had barred their course. In primitive guise, journeyed homeward those dispersed ones. Rare, in these days, was the carriage, or stage-coach for the traveller; Roads, unmacadamized, making rude havoc of delicate springs. Around the door, horses gather with the antique side-saddle and pillion, Led thence to the full barn, while their riders find heartfelt welcome. Then all whom culinary cares release, hasten to the House of Worship, Religion being invoked to sanction the rejoicing of the fathers. Plain was the village-church, a structure of darkened wood, Having doors on three sides, and flanked by sheds for the horses, Guiltless of blackening stove-pipe, or the smouldering fires of the furnace. Assaulted oft were its windows, by the sonorous North-Western, Making organ-pipes in the forest, for its shrill improvisations Patient of cold, sate the people, each household in its own square pew, Palisaded above the heads of the children, imprisoning their roving eyes. Patiently sate the people, while from 'neath the great sounding-board, The preacher unfolded his sermon, like the many-headed cauliflower. Grave was the good pastor, not prone to pamper animal appetites, But mainly intent to deal with that which is immortal. Prolix might he have been deemed, save by the flock he guided, Who duteously accounted him but a little lower than the angels. As solemn music to the sound of his monotonous periods Listened attentively the young, until he slowly enunciated Fifteenthly, in the division of his elaborate discourse. Then gadded away their busy thoughts to the Thanksgiving dinner, Visioning good things to come. At length, around the table, Duly bless'd by the Master of the feast, they cheerily assemble. Before him, as his perquisite, and prerogative to carve. In a lordly dish smokes the huge, well-browned Turkey, Chickens were there, to whose innocent lives Thanksgiving is ever a death-knell; Luscious roasters from the pen, the large ham of a red complexion, Garnish'd and intermingled with varied forms of vegetable wealth. Ample pasties were attached, and demolished with dexterity, Custards and tarts, and compounds of the golden-faced pumpkin, Prime favorite, without whose aid scarcely could New England have been thankful. Apples, with plump, waxen cheeks, chestnuts, and the fruit of the hickory, Bisected neatly, without fragment, furnished the simple dessert, Finale to that festival where each guest might be safely merry. Hence, by happy-hearted children, was it hailed as the polestar, Toward which Memory looked backward six months, and Hope forward for six to come, Dating reverently from its era, as the Moslem from his Hegira. Hymen also hailed it as his revenue, and crowning time; Bachelors wearied with the restraints that courtship imposes, Longed for it, as the Israelite for the jubilee of release, And many a householder, in his family-bible marked its date As the day of his espousals, and of the gladness of his heart. Content was the life of agriculture, in unison with that wisest prayer âThy will be done.â Wisest, because who, save the Eternal Knoweth what is best for man, walking ignorantly among shadows, Himself a shadow, not like Adam our father in Paradise, Rightly naming all things, but calling evil, good, and good, evil, Blindly blaming the discipline that might bless him everlastingly, And embracing desires, that in their bosom hide the dagger of Ehud. Asketh he for honor? In its train are envyings and cares; Wealth? It may drown the soul in destruction and perdition; Power? Lo! it casteth on some lone St. Helena to die: Surely, safest of all petitions, is that of our blessed Saviour,â âNot my will but Thine.â Thus, as it was in the days before us, Rural life in New-England, with its thrift, and simplicity, Minutely have I depicted, not emulous of embellishment. More of refinement might it boast when our beautiful birth-clime, From the colonial chrysalis emerging, spread her wing among the nations. Then rose an aristocracy, founded not on wealth alone That winds may scatter like desert sands, or the floods wash away, But on the rock of solid virtue, where securely anchors the soul. Mid its cultured acres rose gracefully a dwelling of the better class, Large, but not lofty, its white walls softened by surrounding shades, Fresh turf at its feet like velvet, green boughs bannering its head, Bannering, and dropping music, till the last rustle of the falling leaves. There, still in her comely prime, dwelt the lady of the mansion Moderate would her fortune be held in these days that count by millions, Yet rich was she, because having no debts, what seemed to be hers, was so; Rich, in having a surplus for the poor, which she gladly imparted; Rich too, through Agriculture, pursued less from need than habit. Habit mingled with satisfaction, and bringing health in its train. Early widowhood had touched her brow with sadness such as time bringeth, Yet in her clear eye was a fortitude, surmounting adversity. Busy were her maidens, and happy, their right conduct kindly approved, Busy also the swains thro' whose toil her fields yielded increase Respect had she for labor; knowing both what to require, and when it was well performed, Readily rendering full wages, with smiles and words of counsel, Accounting those who served her, friends, entitled to advice and sympathy. Thus, looking well to the ways of her household, and from each expecting their duty, Wisely divided she her time, and at intervals of leisure, Books allured her cultured mind through realms of thought and knowledge. But the deepest well-spring of her joys, not yet hath been unfolded, A fountain where care and sorrow forgot both their name and nature. Two little daughters, like olive plants, grew beside that fountain, One, with dark, deepset eyes, and wealth of raven tresses, The other gleaming as a sunbeam, through her veil of golden hair, With a glance like living sapphire, making the beholder glad. Clinging to the sweet mother's hand, smiling when she smiled, If she were sad, grieving also, they were her blessed comforters, Morn and Even were they styled by admiring, fanciful visitants, So âthe evening and the morning, were to her soul the first day,â After the heavy midnight of her weeping and widowhood. Side by side, in sweet liberty hither and thither roamed those little ones, Hunting violets on the bank, tasting cheese curds in the dairy, Seeking red and white strawberries, as ripening they ran in the garden beds, To fill the small basket for their mother, covering the fruit with rose-buds, Peering archly to see if she would discover what was lurking beneath. Gamboling with the lambs, shouting as the nest-builders darted by, Sharing in the innocence of one, and catching song from the other. Nightly on the same snowy pillow, were laid their beautiful heads, The same morning beam kiss'd away their lingering slumbers, The first object that met their waking eye, was the bright, sisterly smile. One impulse moved both hearts, as kneeling by their little bed, Breathed forth from ruby lips, âOur Father, who art in Heaven!â Simple homage, meekly blending in a blessed stream of incense. Forth went they among the wild flowers, making friendship with the dragon-fly, With the ant in her circling citadel, with the spider at her silk-loom, Talking to the babbling brook, speaking kindly to the uncouth terrapin, And frog, who to them seem'd dancing joyously in watery halls. Like the chirping of the wood-robin murmured their tuneful voices, Or rang out in merry laughter, gladdening the ear of the Mother, Who when she heard it afar off, laughed also, not knowing wherefore. Thus, in companionship with Nature, dwelt they, growing each day more happy, Loving all things that she cherish'd, and loved by her in return. Yet not idly pass'd their childhood, in New England's creed that were heresy, Promptly, as strength permitted, followed they examples of industry, Lovingly assisting the Mother wherever her work might be. Surprising was it to see what their small hands could accomplish, Without trespassing on the joy of childhood, that precious birthright of life. Diligently wrought they in summer, at the dame's school with plodding needle, Docile at their lessons in winter, stood they before the Master: Yet learning most from Home and Mother, those schools for the heart, Befitting best that sex, whose sphere of action is in the heart. Attentive were they to the Parents rule, and to the open book of Nature, Teachers, whose faithful pupils shall be wise towards God. Different were the two daughters, though to the same discipline subjected. Grave was the elder born and thoughtful, even beyond her years, Night upon her tresses, but the star of morning in her heart. Exceeding fair was the younger, and witty, and full of grace, Winning with her sunny ringlets, the notice of all beholders. Different also were their temperaments, one loving like the Violet Shaded turf, where the light falls subdued through sheltering branches, The other, as the Tulip, exulting in the lustrous noontide, And the prerogatives of beauty, to see, and to be seen. Sweet was it to behold them, when the sun grew low in summer, Riding gracefully through the green-wood, each on her ambling palfrey, One, white as milk, and the other like shining ebony, For so in fanciful love had the Mother selected for her darlings. Sweet was it to mark them, side by side, in careless beauty, Looking earnestly in each others' faces, thought playfully touching thought. Chief speaker was Miranda, ever fearless and most fluent. âTired am I of always seeing the same dull, old scenes. I wish the rail-fences would tumble down, and the sprawling apple-trees,â And the brown farm-houses take unto themselves wings and fly away, Like the wild-geese in autumn, if only something might be new. There's the Miller forever standing on that one same spot of ground, Watching his spouting wheel, when there's water, and when there is none, Grumbling, I suppose, at home, to his spiritless wife and daughters. I like not that fusty old Miller, his coat covered with meal, Ever tugging at bags, and shoveling corn into the hopper.â Discreetly answer'd Bertha, and the lively one responded, Lively, and quick-sighted, yet prone to be restless and unsatisfied, âCounting rain-drops as they fall, one by one, from sullen branches. Seeing silly lambkins leap, and the fan-tail'd squirrels scamper, What are such things to me? Stupid Agriculture I like not, Soap-making, and the science of cheese-tubs, what are they to me? The chief end of life with these hinds and hindesses, Is methinks, to belabor their hands till they harden like brick-bats.â âLook, look, Miranda, dearest! The new moon sweetly rising Holdeth forth her silver crescent, which the loyal stars perceiving, Gather gladly to her banner, like a host around their sovereign. Let us find the constellations that our good Instructor taught us. Remember you not yesterday, when our lesson was well-render'd, How with unwonted flattery he call'd us his Hesperus and Aurora?â âThese hum-drum teachings fire me, I'm disgusted with reciting And repeating, day by day, what I knew well enough before.â Then quickening briskly her startled steed with the riding-whip, She darted onward through the forest, reaching first their own abode. At night, when they retired, ere the waning lamp was extinguished, That good time for talking, when heart to heart discloseth What the work or the pride of day, might in secrecy have shrouded, Said Miranda, âI have seen our early play-mate, Emilia, From a boarding-school return'd, all accomplished, all delightful, So changed, so improved, her best friends might scarcely know her. Why might not I be favor'd with similar advantages? Caged here, year by year, with wings beating the prison-door; I would fain go where she went. If overruled I shall be wretched. I must go, Bertha, yes! No obstacle shall withhold me.â âOh Miranda! Our Mother! In your company is her solace. In your young life she liveth, at your bright smile, ever smileth, Such power have you to cheer her. What could she do without you When the lengthen'd eve grows lonely, and the widow sorrow presseth?â âOh persuade her!â she cried, with an embrace of passionate fervor, âPersuade her, Bertha! and I'll be your bond-servant forever.â Seldom had a differing purpose ruffled long those sisterly bosoms. Wakeful lay Bertha, the silent tear for her companion, While frequent sighs swelling and heaving the snowy breast of Miranda, Betray'd that troubled visions held her spirit in their custody. Like twin streamlets had they been, from one quiet fountain flowing, Stealing on through fringed margins anon playfully diverging, Yet to each other as they wander'd, sending messages through whispering reeds, Then returning and entwining joyously, with their cool chrystalline arms. But who that from their source marketh infant brooklets issue, Like sparkling threads of silver, wending onward through the distance Can foretell which will hold placid course among the vallies, Content with silent blessings from the fertile soil it cheereth, Or which, mid rocky channels contending and complaining, Now exulting in brief victory, then in darken'd eddies creeping, Leaps its rampart and is broken on the wheel of the cataract. Generous is the love and holy that springeth from gratitude; Rooting not in blind instinct, grasping not, exacting not, Remembering the harvest on which it fed, and the toil of the harvester; Fain would it render recompense according to what it hath received, Or falling short, weepeth. As the leaf of the white Lily Bendeth backward to the stalk whence its young bud drew nutrition, So turneth the Love of Gratitude, with eye undimm'd and fervent, To parent, friend, teacher, benefactor, bountiful Creator. Sympathies derived from such sources ever sacredly cherishing; Daughter of Memory, inheriting her mother's immortality, Welcome shall she find among angels, where selfish love may not enter. CANTO SECOND. In the gay and crowded city Where the tall and jostling roof-trees Jealous seem of one another, Jealous of the ground they stand on, Each one thrusting out its neighbor From the sunrise, or the sunset, In a boarding school of fashion Was Miranda comprehended, Goal of her supreme ambition. âGirls were there from different regions, Distant States, and varying costumes, She was beautiful they told her, And her mirror when she sought it Gave concurrent testimony. âMany teachers met their classes In this favorite Institution Where accomplishments or studies Were pursued as each selected, Or their parents gave commandment. But Miranda was impeded In successful application, By the consciousness of beauty And the vanity it fosters. âVery fond was she of walking In the most frequented places, Fondly fancying all beholders Gazed on her with admiration. Striking dresses, gay with colors She disported and commended, Not considering that the highest Of attractions in a woman Is simplicity of costume, And a self-forgetful sweetness. âMen with business over-laden, Men of science, pondering axioms, Men of letters, lost in reverie, She imagined when they passed her Gaz'd with secret admiration, Ask'd in wonder, âwho can that be?â Backward turned perchance, to view her, As she lightly glided onward. âSo completely had this beauty Leagued with vanity, uprooted Serious thought and useful purpose, And the nobler ends of being, That even in the solemn Temple Where humility befitteth All who offer adoration, Close observance of the apparel Of acquaintances or strangers, And a self-display intruded On the service of devotion, While her fair cheek oft-times rested Daintily on gloveless fingers Where the radiant jewels sparkled On a hand like sculptured marble. Meantime in the rural mansion Whence with gladness she departed, Sate the mother and the sister By the hearth-stone or the lamp-light, Thinking of their loved Miranda, Speaking of her, working for her, Writing tender, earnest letters To sustain her mid her studies, Fearing that her health might suffer By the labor and privation That a year at school demanded. âAs the autumnal evenings lengthen'd, Bertha with a filial sweetness Sought her mother's favorite authors, And with perfect elocution Made their sentiments and feelings, Guests around the quiet fireside. âPage of Livy, or of CÃ¦sar, Stirring scenes of tuneful Maro, From their native, stately numbers To the mother's ear she rendered; Or with her o'er ancient regions, Fallen sphynx, or ruin'd column, Led by guiding Rollin, wandered, Deeply mused with saintly Sherlock, Or through Milton's inspiration Scanned the lore of forfeit Eden. With the vertic rays of Summer Homeward came the fair Miranda. How the village people wonder'd At her fashions, and her movements, How she made the new piano Tremble to its inmost centre With andante, and bravura, What a piece she had to show them Of Andromache the Trojan, Wrought in silks of every color, And 'twas said a foreign language Such as princes use in Paris, She could speak to admiration. âGreatly their surprise amused her, But the Mother and the Sister With their eagle-eyed affection, Spied a thorn amid the garland, Heard the sighing on her pillow, Saw the flush invade her forehead, And were sure some secret sorrow Rankled in that snowy bosom. Rumor, soon with hundred voices Whisper'd of a dashing lover, Irreligious and immoral, And the anxious Mother counsel'd Sad of heart her fair-hair'd daughter. âScarce with any show of reverence Listen'd the impatient maiden, Then with tearless eyes wide open Like full orbs of shadeless sapphire All unpausing, thus responded. ââI have promised Aldebaran, To be his,âalone,âforever! And I'll keep that promise, Mother, Though the firm skies fall around me, And yon stars in fragments shatter'd, Each with thousand voices warn'd me. âThou hast spoken words reproachful, Doubting of his soul's salvation, Of his creed I never question'd, But where'er he goes, I follow. Whatsoe'er his lot, I'll share it, Though it were the darkest chamber In the lowest hell. 'Twere better There with him, than 'mid the carols Of the highest heaven, without him.â Swan-like arms were wrapped around her With a cry of better pleading, âOh Miranda!âOh my Sister! Gather back the words you've spoken, Quickly, ere the angel write them Weeping on the doom's day tablet. âYou have grieved our blessed Mother: See you not the large tears trickle Down those channels deeply furrow'd Which the widow-anguish open'd? Kneel beside me, Oh my Sister! Darling of my cradle slumbers, Ask the grace of God to cleanse thee From thy blasphemy and blindness, Supplicate the Great Enlightener Here to purge away thy madness, Pray our Saviour to forgive thee.â âBertha! Bertha! speak not to me, What knowest thou of love almighty? Naught except that craven spirit Measuring, weighing, calculating, That goes shivering to its bridal. On this deathless soul, all hazard Here I take, and if it perish, Let it perish. From the socket This right eye I'd pluck, extinguish This right hand if he desire it, And go maim'd through all the ages That Eternity can number. âPrayer is not for me, but action, Against thee, and Her who bare me Stand I at Love's bidding, boldly In the armor that he giveth, For life's battle, strong and ready. âHush! I've sworn, and I'll confirm it.â In due time, the handsome suitor Paid his devoirs to Miranda, In her own paternal dwelling. Very exquisite in costume, Very confident in manner, Pompous, city-bred, and fearless Was the accepted Aldebaran. âAnxious felt she, lest the customs Of the rustic race around her, So she styled her rural neighbors, Might discourage or disgust him, But he gave them no attention, Quite absorbed in other matters. âIn their promenades together She beheld the people watching Mid their toils of agriculture, Saw them gaze from door and windows, Little ones from gates and fences, On the stylish Alderbaran, And her heart leap'd up exulting. âNotice took he of the homestead, With an eye of speculation, Ask'd the number of its acres, And what revenue they yielded. Notice took of herds and buildings With their usufruct, and value, Closer note than seem'd consistent With his delicate position; But Miranda, Cupid blinded, No venality detected. âHe, in gorgeous phrase address'd her, With an oriental worship, As some goddess condescending To an intercourse with mortals. Pleas'd was she with such observance, Pleas'd and proud that those around her Should perceive what adoration Was to her, by him accorded. âWhen he left, 'twas with the assurance The next visit should be final. Marking on his silver tablet With gay hand, the day appointed When he might return to claim her In the nuptial celebration. There's a bridal in the spring-time, When the bee from wintry covert Talking to the unsheath'd blossoms, Meditates unbounded plunder, And the bird mid woven branches Brooding o'er her future treasures Harkeneth thrilling to the love-song Of her mate, who nestward tendeth. âThere's a bridal in the spring-time, And the beautiful Miranda Through her veil of silvery tissue Gleams, more beautiful than ever. From the hearth-stone of her fathers, With the deathless love of woman Trusting all for earth or heaven To a mortal's rule and guidance, One, but short time since, a stranger, Forth she goes. The young beholders Gazing on the handsome bridegroom, Gazing on the nuptial carriage, Where the milk-white horses sported Knots of evergreen and myrtle, Felt a pleasure mix'd with envy At a happiness so perfect. âBut more thoughtful ones, instructed By the change of time and sorrow, By the cloud and by the sunbeam, Felt the hazard that attended Such intrustment without limit, Vows that none had right to cancel Save the hand of Death's dark Angel. Of the sadness left behind her In the mansion whence she parted, Loneliness, and bitter heart-ache, Deep, unutter'd apprehension, Fearful looking for of judgment, It were vain in lays so feeble To attempt a true recital. âStill, to Mother and to Sister Came epistles from Miranda, Essenc'd and genteelly written, Painting happiness so perfect, So transcending expectation, So surpassing all that fancy In her wildest flights had pencil'd, That even Eden ere the tempter Coil'd himself amid the blossoms Fail'd to furnish fitting symbol. Heartfelt bliss is never boastful, Like the holy dew it stealeth To the bosom of the violet, Only told by deeper fragrance. âHe who saith âSee! see! I'm happy? Happier than all else around me,â Leaves, perchance, a doubt behind him Whether he hath comprehended What true happiness implieth. Oh, the storm-cloud and the tempest! Oh, the dreary night of winter! Drifting snows, and winds careering Down the tall, wide-throated chimney, Like the shrieking ghosts from Hades. Shrieking ghosts of buried legions. ââMother! hear I not the wailing Of a human voice?â âMy daughter! 'Tis the blast that rends the pine-trees. The old sentry-Oak is broken, Close beside our chamber-window, And its branches all are moaning. 'Tis their grief you hear, my daughter.â But the maiden's ear was quicken'd To all plaint of mortal sorrow, And when next, the bitter north wind Lull'd, to gather strength and vigor, For a new exacerbation, Listening close, she caught the murmur, âHush mein daughter! hush mein baby.â Then she threw the door wide open, Though the storm rush'd in upon her, With its blinding sleet and fury. What beheld she, near the threshold, Prostrate there beside the threshold, But a woman, to whose bosom Clung a young and sobbing infant? âOh the searching look that kindled 'Neath those drooping, straining eye-lids, Searching mid the blast and darkness, For some helper in her anguish, Searching, kindling look, that settled Into heavy, deadly slumber, As the waning taper flashes Once, to be relumin'd never. Still her weak arm clasp'd the baby, Rais'd its pining, pinching features, Faintly cried, âMein kind! Have pity, Pity, for the love of Jesus!â âYes, forlorn, benighted wanderer, Thy poor, failing feet have brought thee Where the love of Jesus dwelleth. Gently in a bed they laid her, Chafed her stiffening limbs and temples, Pour'd the warm, life-giving cordial, But what seem'd the most to cheer her, Were some words by Bertha spoken In her own, dear native language. Voice of Fatherland! it quicken'd All the heart's collapsing heart-strings, As though bath'd, and renovated In the Rhine's blue, rushing waters. O'er the wildering waste of ocean, Moved by zeal of emigration She had ventured with her husband To this western World of promise, Rainbow-vested El-Dorado. On that dreary waste of waters He had died, and left her mourning, All unguided, unbefriended. âThere the mother-sorrow found her And compell'd her by the weeping Of the new-born, to encounter With a broken-hearted welcome Life once more, which in the torrent Of her utter desolation She had cast aside, contemning As a burden past endurance. âOutcast in this land of strangers, Strange of speech, and strange in manner, She had travel'd, worn and weary, Here and there, with none to aid her, Ask'd for work, and none employ'd her, Ask'd for alms, and few reliev'd her, Till at length, the wintry tempest Smote her near that blessed roof-tree. Heavy slumber weigh'd her downward, Slumber from whence none awaketh. Yet at morn they heard her sighing, On her pillow faintly sighing, âI am ready! I am ready!â âLeonore! my child! my darling!â Then they brought the infant to her, Cleanly robed, and sweetly smiling, And the parting soul turn'd backward, And the clay-seal on the eyelids Lifted up to gaze upon it. Bertha kiss'd the little forehead, Said âmein kind,â and lo! a shudder Of this earth's forgotten pleasure Trembled o'er the dying woman, And the white hand cold as marble Strove to raise itself in blessing, For the mother-joy was stronger That one moment, while it wrestled With the pausing king of terrors, Stronger than the king of terrors. Then they laid her icy fingers Mid the infant's budding ringlets, And the pang and grasp subsided In a smile and whispering cadence, âGod, mein God, be praised!ââand silence Settled on those lips forever. Favor'd is the habitation Where a gentle infant dwelleth, When its brightening eye revealeth The immortal part within it, And its curious wonder scanneth All its wide spread, tiny fingers, And its velvet hand caressing Pats the nurse's cheek and bosom, Hoary Age grows young before it, As the branch that Winter blighted At the touch of Spring reviveth. When its healthful form evolveth, And with quadrupedal pleasure Creeping o'er the nursery carpet, Aiming still, its flowery surface With faint snatches to appropriate, Or the bolder art essaying On its two round feet to balance And propel the swaying body As with outstretch'd arms it hastens Tottering toward the best beloved, Hope, her freshest garland weaveth Glittering with the dews of morning. When the lisping tongue adventures The first tones of imitation, Or with magic speed o'ermasters The philosophy of language Twining round the mind of others, Preferences, and pains and pleasures, Tendrils strong, of sentient being, Seeking kindness and indulgence, Loving sports and smiles, and gladness, Tenderest love goes forth to meet it, Love that every care repayeth. Thus the little German exile Leaning on her foster parents Brought a love that soothed and cheer'd them, And with sweet confiding meekness Taught to older ones the lesson Of the perfect trust, we children Of One Great Almighty Parent Should repose in His protection Goodness and unerring wisdom: Though His discipline mysterious Oft transcendeth feeble reason, And perchance overthrows the fabrics That in arrogance we builded, Call'd our own, and vainly rented To a troop of hopes and fancies, Gay-robed joys, or fond affections. 'Tis a solemn thing and lovely, To adopt a child, whose mother Dwelleth in the land of spirits: In its weakness give it succor, Be in ignorance its teacher, In all sorrow its consoler, In temptation its defender, Save what else had been forsaken, Win for it a crown in Heaven,â Tis a solemn thing and lovely, Such a work as God approveth. Blessed are the souls that nurture With paternal care the orphan, Neath their roof-tree lending shelter, At their table breathing welcome, Giving armor for the journey And the warfare that awaiteth Every pilgrim, born of woman, Blessed, for the grateful prayer Riseth unto Him who heareth The lone sigh of the forsaken, Bendeth, mid the song of seraphs, To the crying of the ravens, From whose nest the brooding pinion By the archer's shaft was sever'd. Pomp and wealth, and pride of office With their glitter and their shouting, May not pass through death's dark valley, May not thrill the ear that resteth Mid the silence of the grave-yard; But the deed that wrought in pity Mid the outcast and benighted, In the hovel or the prison, On the land or on the ocean, Shunning still the applause of mortals, Comes it not to His remembrance Who shall say amid the terrors Of the last Great Day of Judgment, âInasmuch as ye have done it Unto one, the least, the lowest, It was done to Me, your Saviour.â CANTO THIRD. I'll change my measure, and so end my lay, Too long already. I can't manage well The metre of that master of the lyre, Who Hiawatha, and our forest tribes Deftly described. Hexameters, I hate, And henceforth do eschew their company, For what is written irksomely, will be Read in like manner. What did I say last In my late canto? Something, I believe Of gratitude. Now this same gratitude Is a fine word to play on. Many a niche It fills in letters, and in billet-doux,â Its adjective a graceful prefix makes To a well-written signature. It gleams A happy mirage in a sunny brain; But as a principle, is oft, I fear, Inoperative. Some satirist hath said That gratitude is only a keen sense Of future favors. As regards myself, Tis my misfortune, and perhaps, my fault, Yet I'm constrain'd to say, that where my gifts And efforts have been greatest, the return Has been in contrast. So that I have shrunk To grant myself the pleasure of great love Lest its reward might be indifference, Or smooth deceit. Others no doubt have been More fortunate. I trust 'tis often so: But this is my experience, on the scale Of three times twenty years, and somewhat more. In that calm happiness which Virtue gives, Blent with the daily zeal of doing good, Mother and daughter dwelt. Once, as they came From their kind visit to a child of need, Cheered by her blessings,âat their home they found Miranda and her son. With rapid speech, And strong emotion that resisted tears Her tale she told. Forsaken were they both, By faithless sire and husband. He had gone To parts unknown, with an abandon'd one He long had follow'd. Brokenly she spake Of taunts and wrongs long suffer'd and conceal'd With woman's pride. Then bitterly she pour'd Her curses on his head. With shuddering tears They press'd her to their hearts. âCome back! Come back! To your first home and Heaven's compassions heal Your wounded spirit.â Lovingly they cast Their mantle o'er her, striving to uplift Her thoughts to heavenly sources, and allure To deeds of charity, that draw the sting From selfishness of sorrow.â But she shrank From social intercourse, nor took her seat Even in the House of God, lest prying eyes Should gloat upon her downfall. Books, nor work Enticed her, and the lov'd piano's tone Waking sad echoes of the days that were, She seem'd to shun. Her joy was in her child. The chief delight and solace of her life To adorn his dress, and trim his shining curls, Dote on his beauty, and conceal his faults, With weak indulgence. âOh, Miranda, love! Teach your fair boy, obedience. 'Tis the first Lesson of life. To him, you fill the place Of that Great Teacher who doth will us all To learn submission.â But Miranda will'd In her own private mind, not to adopt Such old-world theories, deeming the creed Of the grey-headed Mother, obsolete. âHer boy was fair; but in those manners fail'd That render beauty pleasing. Great regard Had he for self, and play, and dainty food, Unlike those Jewish children, who refused The fare luxurious of Chaldea's king, And on their simple diet grow more fair And healthful than their mates, and wiser too, Than the wise men of Babylon. I've seen Ill-fortune follow those, whose early tastes Were pampered and inured to luxury. Their palates seem'd to overtop the brain, And the rank Dives-pleasure, to subvert Childhood's simplicity of sweet content. âPrecocious appetites, when overruled, Or disappointed, lend imperious strength To evil tempers, and a fierce disdain. Methought, our Mother-Land, in this respect Had wiser usages. Her little ones At their own regular, plain table learn'd No culinary criticism, nor claim'd Admission to the richly furnish'd board Nor deem'd the viands of their older friends Pertain'd to them. A pleasant sight it was At close of day, their simple supper o'er, To find them in the quiet nursery laid, Like rose-buds folded in a fragrant sheath To peaceful slumber. Hence their nerves attain'd Firm texture, and the key-stone of the frame, This wondrous frame, so often sinn'd against,â Unwarp'd and undispeptic, gave to life A higher zest. Year after year swept by, And Conrad's symmetry of form and face Grew more conspicuous. Yet he fail'd to win Approval from the pious, or desire To seek him as companion for their sons. âAt school and college he defied restraint, And round the associates of his idle hours Threw a mysterious veil. But rumor spake Of them, as those who would be sure to bring Disgrace and infamy. Strong thirst for gold Sprang with the weeds of vice. His mother's purse Was drain'd for him, and when at length she spake In warm remonstrance, he with rudeness rush'd Out of her presence, or withdrew himself All night from her abode. Then she was fain To appease his anger by some lavish gift From scant resources, which she ill could spare, Making the evil worse. The growth of sin Is rank and rapid when the youthful heart Abjures the sway of duty. Weaving oft The mesh of falsehood, may it not forget What the truth is? The wavering, moral sense Depraved and weaken'd, fails to grasp the clue Of certainty, nor scruples to deny Words utter'd, and deeds done, for conscience sleeps Stifled, and callous. Fearful must it be, When Truth offended and austere, confronts The false soul at Heaven's bar. An aged man Dwelt by himself upon a dreary moor, And it was whisper'd that a miser's hoard Absorb'd his thoughts. There, at the midnight hour The unwonted flash of lights was seen by those Who chanced to pass, and entering in, they found The helpless inmate murder'd in his bed, And the house rifled. Differing tracks they mark'd Of flying footsteps in the moisten'd soil, And eager search ensued. At length, close hid In a dense thicket, Conrad they espied, His shoes besmear'd with blood. Question'd of those Who with him in this work of horror join'd, He answered nothing. All unmov'd he stood Upon his trial, the nefarious deed Denying, and of his accomplices Disclosing nought. But still there seem'd a chain Of evidence to bind him in its coil, And Justice had her course. The prison bolts Closed heavily behind him, and his doom For years, with felons was incorporate. Of the wild anguish and despair that reign'd In his ancestral home, no words can give Description meet. In the poor mother's mind Reason forsook its throne. Her last hope gone, Torn by a torrent from her death-like grasp, Having no anchor on the eternal Rock, She plunged beside it, into gulphs profound. âShe slept not, ate not, heeded no kind word, Caress of fondness, or benignant prayer: She only shriek'd, âMy boy! my beautiful! They bind his hands!â And then with frantic cries She struggled 'gainst imaginary foes, Till strength was gone. Through the long syncope Her never-resting lips essay'd to form The gasping sounds, âMy boy! my beautiful! Hence! Caitiffs! hence! my boy! my beautiful!â And in that unquell'd madness life went out, Like lamp before the blast. With sullen port Of bravery, as one who scorns defeat Though it hath come upon him, Conrad met The sentence of the law. But its full force He fail'd to estimate; the stern restraint On liberty of movement, coarsest fare, Stripes for the contumacious, and for all Labor, and silence. The inquiring glance On the new-comer bent, from stolid eyes Of malefactors, harden'd to their lot, And hating all mankind, he coldly shunn'd Or haughtily return'd. Yet there were lights Even in this dark abode, not often found In penal regions, where the wrath of man Is prompt to punish, and remembereth not The mercy that himself doth ask of God. âA just man was the warden and humane, Not credulous, or easily deceiv'd, But hopeful of our nature, though deprav'd, And for the incarcerate, careful to restrain All petty tyranny. Courteous was he To visitants, for many such there were. Philanthropists, whose happy faith believ'd Prisons reforming schools, came here to scan Arrangements and appliances as guides To other institutions: strangers too, Who 'mid their explorations of the State, Scenery and structures, would not overlook Its model-prison. Now and then, was seen Some care worn mother, leading by the hand Her froward boy, with hope that he might learn A lesson from the punishment he saw. âWhen day was closed and to his narrow cell Bearing his supper, every prisoner went, The night-lock firmly clench'd, beside some grate While the large lamp thro' the long corridors Threw flickering light, the Chaplain often stood Conversing. Of the criminal's past life He made inquiry, and receiv'd replies Foreign from truth, or vague and taciturn: And added pious counsels, unobserv'd, Heeded but slightly, or ill understood. The leaden-footed weeks o'er Conrad pass'd, With deadening weight. Privation bow'd his pride. The lily-handed, smiting at the forge, Detested life, and meditated means To accomplish suicide. At dusk of eve, While in his cell, on darkest themes he mused, Before his grate, a veiled woman stood. âShe spake not, but her presence made him glad,â A purer atmosphere seem'd breathing round To expand his shrivell'd heart. Fair gifts she brought, Roses fresh-blown, and cates, and fragrant fruits Most grateful to his fever'd lip. âOh speak! Speak to me!â But she glided light away, And heavenly sweet, her parting whisper said âGood night! With the new moon I'll come again.â âWith the new Moon!â Hope! hope! Its magic wand With phosphorescence ting'd that Stygian pool Of chill despair, in which his soul had sank Lower and lower still. Now, at the forge A blessed vision gleam'd. Its mystery woke The romance of his nature. Every day Moved lighter on, and when he laid it down, It breathed âgood night!â like a complacent child Going to rest. One barrier less remain'd Between him and the goal, and to each night A tarrying, tedious guest, he bade farewell, Like lover, counting toward his spousal-morn. But will she come? And then, he blamed the doubt. His pulse beat quicker, as the old moon died. And when the slender sickle of pale gold Cut the blue concave, by his grated door Stood the veil'd visitant. The breath of flowers Foretold her coming. With their wealth she brought Grapes in the cluster, and a clasped Book, The holiest, and the best. âShow me thine eyes!â He pray'd. But still with undrawn veil, she gave The promise of return, in whisper sweet, âGood night! good night! Wilt read my Book? and say Oh Lamb of God, forgive!â So, by the lamp When tardy Evening still'd the din of toil, He read of Him who came to save the lost, Who touch'd the blind, and they receiv'd their sight, The dead young man, and raised him from his bier, Reproved the raging Sea, and it was still: Deeds that his boyhood heard unheedingly. But here, in this strange solitude of pain With different voice they spake. And as he read, The fragrance of the mignionette he loved, Press'd 'tween the pages, lured him onward still. Now, a new echo in his heart was born, And sometimes mid the weary task, and leer Of felon faces, ere he was aware From a compress'd unmurmuring lip, it broke, O Lamb of God! If still unquell'd Despair Thrust up a rebel standard, down it fell At the o'er-powering sigh, O Lamb of God! And ere upon his pallet low, he sank, It sometimes breathed, âO Lamb of God, forgive! Like the taught lesson of a humbled child. Yet duly as the silver vested moon Hiding awhile in the dark breast of night Return'd to take her regent watch again Over our sleeping planet, softly came That shrouded visitant, preferring still Like those who guard us lest we dash our foot Against a stone, to do her blessed work Unseen. And with the liberal gifts she brought For body, and for soul, there seem'd to float A legacy of holy themes and thoughts Behind her, like an incense-stream. He mused Oft-times of patience, and the dying love Of our dear Lord, nor yet without remorse Of that unsullied Truth which Vice rejects, And God requires. How beautiful is Truth! Her right-lined course, amid the veering curves And tangents of the world, her open face Seeking communion on with the scanning stars, Her grave, severe simplicity of speech Untrammelled by the wiles of rhetoric, By bribes of popular applause unbow'd, In unison with Him she dwells who ruled The tyranny of Chaos, with the words âLet there be light!â Gladly we turn again To that fair mansion mid the rural vales Where first our song awoke. Advancing years Brought to its blessed Lady no regret Or weak complaint for what the hand of Time Had borne away. Enduring charms were hers On which he laid no tax; the beaming smile, The voice of melody, the hand that mark'd Each day with deeds of goodness, and the heart That made God's gift of life more beautiful, The more prolong'd. Its griefs she counted gains, Since He who wisely will'd them cannot err, And loves while He afflicts. Their dialect Was breathed in secret 'tween her soul and Him. But toward mankind, her duties made more pure By the strong heat of their refining fires, Flow'd forth like molten gold. She sought the poor, Counsell'd the ignorant, consoled the sad, And made the happy happier, by her warmth Of social sympathy. She loved to draw The young around her table; well she knew To cheer and teach them, by the tale or song, Or sacred hymn, for music dwelt with her Till life went out. It pleased her much to hear Their innocent merriment, while from the flow And swelling happiness of childhood's heart So simply purchased, she herself imbibed A fuller tide of fresh vitality. Her favor'd guests exultingly rehears'd Their visits to âthe Lady,â counting each A privilege, not having learned the creed Which modern times inculcate in our land That whatsoe'er is old, is obsolete. âStill ever at her side, by night and day Was Bertha, entering into every plan, With zealous aid, assuming every care That brought a burden, catching every smile On the clear mirror of a loving heart, Which by reflection doubled. Thus they dwelt, Mother and daughter, in sweet fellowship, One soul betwixt them. Filial piety Thrives best with generous natures. Here was nought Of self to check it, so it richly bloom'd Like the life-tree, that yieldeth every month New fruits, still hiding mid its wealth of leaves The balm of healing. In that peaceful home The fair-haired orphan was a fount of joy, Spreading her young heart like a tintless sheet For Love to write on. Sporting 'mid the flowers, Caroling with the birds, or gliding light As fawn, her fine, elastic temperament Took happiest coloring from each varying hour Or changing duty. Kind, providing cares Which younglings often thoughtlessly receive Or thankless claim, she gratefully repaid With glad obedience. Pleas'd was she to bear Precocious part in household industry, Round shining bars to involve the shortening thread, And see the stocking grow, or side by side With her loved benefactresses to work Upon some garment for the ill-clad poor, With busy needle. As their almoner, 'Twas her delight to seek some lowly hut And gliding thence, with noiseless footstep, leave With her kind dole, a wonder whence it came. âA heavenly blessing wrapp'd its wing around The adopted orphanage. Oh ye whose homes Are childless, know ye not some little heart Collapsing, for the need of parent's love, That ye might breathe upon? some outcast lamb That ye might shelter in your fold? content To make the sad eye sparkle, guide the feet In duty's path, bring a new soul to Heaven, And take your payment from the Judge's Voice, At the Last Day? âA tireless tide of joy, A world of pleasure in the garden bound, Open'd to Leonore. From the first glance Of the frail Crocus through its snowy sheath, On, to the ripen'd gatherings of the Grape, And thorn-clad chestnut, all was sweet to her. She loved to plant the seed and watch the germ, And nurse the tender leaflet like a babe, And lead the tendril right. To her they seem'd Like living friends. She sedulously mark'd Their health and order, and was skill'd to prune The too luxuriant spray, or gadding vine. She taught the blushing Strawberry where to run, And stoop'd to kiss the timid Violet, Blossoming in the shade, and sometimes dream'd The Lily of the lakelet, calmly throned On its broad leaf, like Moses in his ark, Spake words to her. And so, as years fled by, Young Fancy, train'd by Nature, turn'd to God. Her clear, Teutonic mind, took hold on truth And found in every season, change of joy. âYet her prime pleasure seem'd at wintry eve Tho' storms might fall, when from its branching arms The antique candelabra shed fair light On polished wainscot and rich curtains dropp'd Close o'er the casements, she might draw her seat Near to her aged friend and take her hand And frame her voice to join some tuneful song, Treasuring whate'er of wise remark distill'd From those loved lips. Then, as her Mentor spoke Of God's great goodness in this mortal life, Teaching us both by sorrow and by joy, And how we ought to yield it back with trust And not with dread, whenever He should call, Having such precious promises, through Christ Of gain unspeakable, beyond the grave, The listening pupil felt her heart expand With reverent love. Friendship, 'tween youth and age Is gain to both,ânor least to that which finds The germs of knowledge and experience drop And twine themselves around the unfrosted locks, A fadeless coronet. In this sweet home The lengthen'd day seem'd short for their delights, And wintry evening brief. The historic page Made vocal, brought large wealth to memory. The lore of distant climes, that rose and fell Ere our New World, like Lazarus came forth, The napkin round her forehead, and sate down Beside her startled sisters. Last of all, The large time-honor'd Bible loos'd its clasps And shed its manna on their waiting souls; Then rose the sacred hymn in blended tones, By Bertha's parlor-organ made intense In melody of praise, and fervent Prayer Set its pure crown upon the parted day, And kiss'd the Angel, Sleep. Yet ere they rose From bended knee, there was a lingering pause, A silent orison for one whose name But seldom pass'd their lips, though in their hearts His image with its faults and sorrows dwelt, Invoking pity of a pardoning God. âThus fled the years away, the cultured glebe Stirr'd by the vernal plough-share, yielding charms To Summer, pouring wealth o'er Autumn's breast, Pausing from weary toil, when Winter comes, Bringing its Sabbath, as the man of eld With snow upon his temples, peaceful sits In his arm-chair, to ruminate and rest. Once, at that season when the ices shrink Befere the vernal equinox, at morn There was no movement in the Lady's room, Who prized the early hours like molten gold, And ever rose before the kingly Sun. âOn the white pillow still reposed her head, Her cheek upon her hand. She had retired In health, affection's words, and trustful prayers Hallowing her lips. Now, on her brow there seem'd Unwonted smoothness, and the smile was there Set as a seal, with which the call she heard, âCome! sister-spirit!â She had gain'd the wish Oft utter'd to her God, to pass away Without the sickness and enfeebled powers That tax the heart of love. Death that unbars Unto the ready soul the Gate of Heaven, Claiming no pang or groan from failing flesh, Doth angel-service. But alas! the shock, The chill, the change, the anguish, where she dwelt, And must return no more. As one amaz'd The stricken daughter held her breath for awe, God seem'd so near. Methought she saw the Hand That smote her. Half herself was reft away, Body and soul. Yet no repining word Announc'd her agony. The tolling bell To hill and valley, told with solemn tongue That death had been among them, and at door And window listening, aged crone and child Counted its strokes, a stroke for every year, And predicated thence, as best they might, Whom they had lost. Neighbor of neighbor ask'd, Till the sad tidings were possess'd by all. âA village funeral is a thing that warns All from their homes. In the throng'd city's bound, Hearses unnoticed pass, and none inquire Who goeth to his grave. But rural life Keepeth afresh the rills of sympathy. True sorrow was there at these obsequies, For all the poor were mourners. There the old Came in the garments she had given, bow'd down With their own sense of loss. O'er furrow'd cheeks In care-worn channels stole the trickling tear. The young were weepers, for their memories stored Many a gentle word, and precept kind, Like jewels dropp'd behind her. Mothers rais'd Their little ones above the coffin's side To look upon her face. Lingering they gazed Deeming the lovely Lady sweetly slept Among the flowers that on her pillow lay. He's but a tyro in the school of grief Who hath not from the victor-tomb return'd Unto his rifled home. The utter weight Of whelming desolation doth not fall Till the last rites are paid. The cares of love Having no longer scope, withdraw their shield, And even the seat whereon the lost one sate, The pen he held, the cup from which he drank, Launch their keen darts against the festering soul. âThe lonely daughter, never since her birth Divided from the mother, having known No separate pleasure, or secreted thought, With deep humility resumed her course Of daily duty and philanthropy, Not murmuring, but remembering His great love Who lent so long that blessing beyond price, And from her broken censer offering still Incense of praise. She deem'd it fearful loss To lose a sorrow, be chastis'd in vain, Not yield our joys, but have them rent away, And make this life a battle-field with God. The sombre shadow brooding o'er their home Was felt by all. The heart of Leonore Dwindled and shrank beneath it. Vigor fled The untasted meal, and couch bedew'd with tears Gave the solution to her wasted flesh, And drooping eye-lids. Folded in her arms, Bertha with tender accents said, âmy child, We please not her who to the angels went, By hopeless grief. Doubt not her watchful eye Regards us, though unseen. How oft she taught To make God's will our own. You, who were glad To do her bidding then, distress her not By disobedience now. Waste not the health In reckless martyrdom, which Heaven hath link'd With many duties, and with hope to dwell If faithful found, with Her who went before And beckoning waits us.â From dull trance of grief By kind reproof awakened, Leonore Strove to redeem her scholarship from blame And be a comforter, as best she might To her remaining patroness. Within The limits of a neighboring town, a wretch Fell by the wayside, struck by sudden Death That vice propels. A Man of God, who sought Like his blest Master every form of woe Found him, and to a shelter and a couch Convey'd. Then bending down, with earnest words For time grew short, he urg'd him to repent. âSay, Lord have mercy on my soul. Look up Unto the Lamb of God, for He can save Even to the uttermost.â Slight heed obtain'd This adjuration, wild the glazing eye Fix'd on the wall,âand ever and anon The stiffening fingers clutch'd at things unseen, While from those spent lungs came a shuddering sound, âThat's he! That's he! The old man! His grey hairs Dabbled with blood!â Then in a loud, long cry, Wrung out by torturing pain, âI struck the blow! I tell ye that I struck the blow, and scaped. Conrad who bore the doom is innocent, Save fellowship with guilt.â And so he fled; The voice of prayer around him, but the soul Beyond its reach. The kneeling Pastor rose Sadly, as when the Shepherd fails to snatch A wanderer from the Lion. But the truth Couch'd in that dismal cry of parting life He treasured up, and bore to those who held Power to investigate and to reprieve; And authorized by them with gladness sought The gloomy prison. Conrad there he found In sullen syncope of sickening thought, And cautiously in measured terms disclosed His liberation. Wondering doubt look'd forth From eyes that opening wide and wider still Strain'd from their sockets. Yet the hand he took That led him from the cell, and onward moved Like Peter following his angel guide Deeming he saw a vision. As the bolts Drew gratingly to let them pass, he seem'd To gather consciousness, and restless grew With an unspoken fear, lest at the last Some sterner turnkey, or gruff sentinel Might bar their egress. When behind them closed. The utmost barrier, and the sweet, fresh air So long witheld, fill'd his collapsing lungs, He shouted rapturously, âAm I alive? Or have I burst the gates of death, and found A second Eden?â The unwonted sound Of his own voice, freed from the drear constraint Of prison durance, swell'd his thrilling frame With strong and joyous impulse, for 'tis said Long stifled utterance is torturing pain To organs train'd to speech. With one high leap Like an enfranchis'd steed he seem'd to throw His spirit-chain behind him. Then he took The Pastor's offer'd arm, who led the way To his own house, and bade him bathe and change His prison garments, and repose that night Under his roof. With thoughtful care he spoke To his own household, kindly to receive The erring one,ââfor we are sinners all, And not upon our merits may depend But on abounding grace.â So when the hour Of cheerful supper summon'd to the board, He came among them as a comely guest, Refresh'd and welcome. Pleasant converse cheer'd The hospitable meal, and then withdrawn Into the quiet study 'mid the books, That saintly good man with the hoary hair Silvering his temples like a graceful crown, Strove by wise counsel to encourage him For life's important duties, But he deem'd A ban was on him, and a mark which all Would scan who met him. âHe whose lot hath been With fiends in Pandemonium, must expect Hate and contempt from men.â âNot so my son! Wipe off the past, as a forgotten thing, Propitiate virtue, by forsaking vice. The good will aid you, and a brighter day Doubtless awaits you. Be not too much moved By man's applause or blame, but ever look Unto a higher Judge.â Then there arose A voice of supplication, so intense To the Great Pardoner, that He would send His spirit down to change and purify The erring heart, that those persuasive tones, So humble, yet so strangely eloquent Breathed o'er the unhappy one like soothing spell Of magic influence, and he slept that night With peace and hope, long exiled from his couch. A summer drive to one sequestered long, Hath charms untold. The common face of earth, The waving grass, the rustle of the leaves, Kiss'd by the zephyr, or by winged bird Disparted, as it finds its chirping nest, The murmur of the brooks, the low of herds, The ever-changing landscape, rock and stream, And azure concave fleck'd with silver clouds Awaken rapturous joy. This Conrad felt, While pleasure every kindling feature touch'd, And every accent tuned. But when they saw The fair ancestral roof through trees afar, Strong agony convuls'd him, and he cried, âNot there! Not there! First take me to Her grave!â And so to that secluded spot they turn'd, Where rest the silent dead. On the green mound, His Mother's bed, with sobs and groans he fell, And in his paroxysm of grief would fain Have torn the turf-bound earth away, to reach The mouldering coffin. Then, a flood of tears, Heaven's blessed gift burst forth, âOh weep, my Son! These gushing tears shall help to wash away Remorseful pangs, and lurking seeds of sin. Here, in this sacred tomb, bury the past, And strong in heavenly trust, resolve to rise To a new life.â Still kneeling on the sod With hands and eyes uprais'd, he said, âI will! So help me God!â The tear was on his cheek Undry'd, when to the home of peace they came. There Bertha greeted them with outstretch'd hands And beaming brow, while the good Pastor said, âThy Son was dead, but is alive again.â A sweet voice answer'd, âLost he was, and found! Oh, welcome home.â She would have folded him In her embrace. But at her feet he fell, Clasping her knees, and bowing down his head, Till she assured him that a mother's love Was in her heart. âAnd there is joy in Heaven Because of him, this day,â the good Man said. âHis tones were tremulous, as up he rose, âAh, my veil'd Angel! Now I see thy face, And hear thy voice.â What were the glowing thoughts Of the meek shepherd, as alone he took His homeward way? The joy of others flow'd O'er his glad spirit like a refluent tide Whose sands were gold. Had he not chosen well His source of happiness? There are, who mix Pride and ambition with their services Before the altar. Did the tinkling bells Upon the garments of the Jewish priest Draw down his thoughts from God? The mitred brow, Doth it stoop low enough to find the souls That struggle in the pits of sin, and die? Methinks ambitious honors might disturb The man whose banner is the Cross of Christ, And earth's high places shut him out of Heaven. âYet this serene disciple, so content To do his Master's will, in humblest works Of charity, had he not chosen well His happiness? The hero hears the trump Of victor-fame, and his high pulses leap, But laurels dipp'd in blood shall vex his soul When the death-ague comes. More blest is he Who bearing on his brow the anointing oil Keeps in his heart the humility and zeal That sanctify his vows. So, full of joy That fears no frost of earth, because its root Is by the river of eternal life, The white-hair'd Pastor took his homeward way. New life upon the farm. A master's eye And step are there. Forest, and cultured field, And garden feel his influence. Forth at morn He goes amid the laboring hinds who bathe Their scythe in fragrant dew mid all their toils Teaching or learning, with such cheerful port As won their hearts. Even animals partook His kind regard. The horse with arching neck, And ear erect, replied as best he might To his caressing tones. The patient ox, With branching horns, and the full-udder'd cow Grew sleek and flourish'd and in happiest guise Reveal'd his regency. The noble dog, O'erflowing with intelligence and zeal, Follow'd him as a friend; even the poor cat Oft scorn'd and distanc'd, till her fawning love Turns into abjectness, crept to his knee Without reproof, and thro' her half-shut eyes Regarding him, ere into sleep she sank With song monotonous, express'd her joy. âHe loved to hear the clarion of the cock, And see him in his gallantry protect The brooding mothers,âof their infant charge So fond and proud. The generous care bestow'd For weal and comfort of these servitors And their mute dialect of gratitude Pleas'd and refresh'd him, while those blessed toils That quicken earth's fertility bestowed The boon of healthful vigor. Bertha found The burden of hear cares securely laid On his young arm, and gratefully beheld Each day a portion of allotted time Spent in the library, with earnest care, Seeking the knowledge that in youth he scorn'd. âAmid their rural neighborhood were some Who frankly took him by the hand, as one, Worthy to rise, and others who preferr'd To cherish evil memories, or indulge Dark auguries. But on his course he held Unmov'd by either, for to her he seem'd Intent and emulous alone to please A higher Judge. When leaning on his arm She sought the House of God, her tranquil brow Seem'd in its time-tried beauty to express The Nunc Dimittis. Prisons are not oft Converting places. Vicious habits shorn Of their top branches, strike a rankling root Darkly beneath, while hatred of mankind And of the justice that decreed such doom Bar out the Love Divine. Yet Bertha felt God's spirit was not limited, and might Pluck brands from out the burning, and in faith Believ'd the son of many prayers had found Remission of his God. His life she scann'd, Of honest, cheerful industry, combined With intellectual progress, and perceived How his religious worship humbly wore The signet âI have sinn'd;â while toward men His speech was cautious, far beyond his years, As one by stern Experience school'd to know The human heart's deceptions. Yet at home And in that fellowship with Nature's works Which Agriculture gives, his soul threw off Its fetters and grew strong. Once as they walk'd Within a favorite grove, consulting where The woodman's ax, or pruning-knife had best Exert their wholesome ministry, he led To a fair resting-place, a turf-bound seat, Beneath a spreading Walnut, carpeted With depth of fragrant leaves, while a slight brook Half-hidden, half revealed, with minstrel touch, Soften'd the spirit. There, in tones subdued By strong emotion, he disclosed his love For Leonore. âOh Conrad! she is pure And peaceful as the lily bud that sleeps On the heaven-mirror'd lake.â âI know it well, Nor would I wake a ripple or a breath To mar its purity.â âYet wait, my Son!â âWait? Mother, wait! It is not in man's heart To love, and wait?â âBut make your prayer to God. Lay your petition at his feet, and see What is His will.â âBefore that God I swear To be her true protector and best friend Till death remove me hence, if she confide At fitting time, that holy trust to me. Oh angel Mother! sanction me to search If in her heart there be one answering chord To my great love. So may we lead below That blended life which with a firmer step And holier joy tends upward toward a realm Of perfect bliss.â Thus authorized, he made Her mind's improvement his delight, and found Community in knowledge was a spell To draw young hearts together. O'er the lore And language of her native land they hung Gleaning its riches with a tireless hand, Deep and enamour'd students. When she sang Or play'd, he join'd her with his silvery flute, Making the thrill of music more intense Through the heart's harmony. Amid the flowers He met her and her garden's pleasant toil Shared with a master's hand for well he knew The nature and the welfare of the plants That most she prized. They loved the umbrageous trees, And in their strong, columnar trunks beheld The Almighty Architect, and for His sake Paid them respect. At the soft twilight hour, He sate beside her silently, and watch'd The pensive lustre of her lifted eye, Intent to welcome the first star that hung Its holy cresset forth. Unconsciously Her moods of lonely musing stole away, And his endear'd society became Part of her being. In her soul was nought Of vanity, or coquetry to bar That heaven-imparted sentiment which makes All hope, all thought, all self, subordinate Unto another's weal, while life shall last. One morn, the orphan sought the private ear Of her kind benefactress. In low tones With the sweet modesty of innocence, She told that Conrad offered her his heart, And in the tender confidence of trust Entreated counsel from her changeless friend. âCan you o'erlook the past, my Leonore?â âOur God forgives the penitent. And we So prone to error, cannot we forgive? The change in Conrad, months and years have made More evident. Might I but sooth away The memory of his woes, and aid his feet More steadfastly to tread in virtue's path, And make him happier on his way to Heaven, My life and love I'd gladly consecrate.â Wrapp'd in her arms the foster-mother gave A tearful blessing, while on bended knee Together they implored the approving smile Of Him, who gives ability to make And keep the covenant of unending love. A rural bridal, Cupid's ancient themes Though more than twice-told, seem not wearisome Or obsolete. The many tomes they prompt Though quaint or prolix, still a place maintain In library or boudoir, and seduce The school-girl from her sleep, and lessons too. But I no tint of romance have to throw On this plain tale, or o'er the youthful pair Who gladly took the irrevocable vow. Their deep and thoughtful happiness required No herald pomp. Buds of the snowy rose, On brow and bosom, were the only gems Of the young fair-hair'd bride, whose ringlets fell Down to her shoulders:ânature's simple veil Of wondrous grace. A few true hearted friends Witness'd the marriage-rite, with cheering smiles And fervent blessings. And the coming years With all their tests of sunshine or of shade, Belied no nuptial promise, striving each With ardent emulation to surpass Its predecessor in the heavenward path Of duty and improvement. Bertha's prayers Were ever round them as a thread of gold Wove daily in the warp and woof of life. In their felicity she found her own Reduplicated. In good deeds to all Who sought her aid, or felt the sting of woe, With unimpaired benevolence she wrought, And tireless sympathy. Ordain'd she seem'd To show the beauty of the life that hath God for its end. Clearer its brightness gleam'd As nearer to its heavenly goal it drew. The smile staid with her till she went above, Death harm'd it not. Her passport to that clime Where Love begun on earth, doth end in joy, Forevermore. IN MEMORIAM. 1859 REV. DR. T. M. COOLEY, For more than sixty years Pastor of one Church in East Granville, Mass, died there in 1859, aged 83. Not in the pulpit where he joy'd to bear The message of salvation, not beside His study-lamp, nor in the fireside chair, Encircled by those dearest ones who found In him their life of life, nor in the homes Of his beloved flock, sharing with them All sympathies of sorrow or of joy, Is seen the faithful Shepherd. He hath gone To yon blest Country where he long'd to be, To stand before the Great White Throne, and join That hymn of praise for which his course below Gave preparation. At one post he stood From youth till fourscore years, averse to change Though oft-times tempted. For he did not deem Restless ambition or desire of gold Fit counterpoise for that most sacred love Born in the inner chambers of the soul, And intertwining with a golden mesh Pastor and people. Like some lofty tree Whose untransplanted roots in freshness meet The living waters, and whose leaf is green 'Mid winter's gather'd frost, serene he stood, More fondly honor'd for each added year, While 'neath his shadow drew with reverent love Successive generations. Hoary Time Linger'd with blessings for his latest day, And now 'neath turf embalm'd with tears he sleeps, Waiting the resurrection of the just. MADAM OLIVIA PHELPS, Widow of the late Anson G. Phelps, Esq., died at New York, April 24th, 1859, aged 74. When the good mother dieth, and the home So long made happy by her boundless love Is desolate and empty, there are tears Of filial anguish, not to be represt; And when the many friends who at her side Sought social sympathy and counsel sweet, Or the sad poor, who, for their Saviour's sake, Found bountiful relief, and kind regard, Stand at that altered threshold, and perceive Faces of strangers from her casement look, There is a pang not to be told in words. Yet, when the christian, having well discharged A life-long duty, riseth where no sin Or possibility of pain or death May follow, should there not be praise to Him Who gives such victory? Thus it is even nowâ Tears with the triumph-strain; For we are made Of flesh as well as spirit, and are taught By Joy and Sorrow, walking side by side, And with strong contrast deepening truths divine. But unto thee, dear friend, whose breath was prayer, And o'er whose mortal sickness hovering Faith Shed heaven's content, there was no further need Of tutelage like that by which we learn, Too slow, perchance, with vacillating minds, What the disciples of our Lord should be; For when the subjugation to God's will Is perfect, and affliction all disarmed, Is not life's lesson done? MARTHA AGNES BONNER, Child of Robert Bonner, Esq., died at New York, April 28th, 1859, aged 13 months. There was a cradling lent us here, To cheer our lot, It was a cherub in disguise, But yet our dim and earth-bow'd eyes Perceiv'd it not. Its voice was like the symphony That lute-strings lend, Yet tho' our hearts the music hail'd As a sweet breath of heaven, they fail'd To comprehend. It linger'd till each season fill'd Their perfect round, The vernal bud, the summer-rose, Autumnal gold, and wintry snows Whitening the ground. But when again reviving Spring Thro' flowers would roam, And the white cherry blossoms stirr'd Neath the soft wing of chirping bird, A call from angel-harps was heard, âCherub,âcome home. MADAM WHITING, Widow of the late Spencer Whiting, Esq., died at Hartford, April, 1859, aged 88. Life's work well done, how beautiful to rest. Aye, lift your little ones to see her face, So calmly smiling in its coffin-bed! There is no wrinkle there,âno rigid gloom To make them turn their tender glance away; And when they say their simple prayer at night With folded hands,âinstruct their innocent lips Meekly to say âOur Father! may we live, And die like her.â Her more than fourscore years Chill'd not in her the genial flow of thought Or energy of deed. The earnest power To advance home-happiness, the kindly warmth Of social intercourse, the sweet response Of filial love, rejoicing in her joy, And reverencing her saintly piety, Were with her, unimpair'd, until the end. A course like this, predicted close serene, And so it was. There came no cloud to dim Her spirit's light, when at a beckoning brief She heavenward went. Miss'd is she here, and mourn'd; From hall, from hearthstone, and from household board, A beauty and a dignity have fled,â And the heart's tears as freely flowed for her, As for the loved ones, in their prime of days. Age justly held in honor, hath a charm Peculiarly its own, a symmetry Of nearness to the skies. And these were hers, Whose life was duty, and whose death was peace. DENISON OLMSTED, LL. D., Professor of Astronomy in Yale College, Conn., died at New Haven, May, 1859. Spring pour'd fresh beauty o'er the cultured grounds, And woke to joyance every leaf and flower, Where erst the Man of Science lov'd to find Refreshment from his toils. 'Twas sweet to see How Nature met him there, and took away All weariness of knowledge. Yet he held Higher communion than with fragrant shrub, Or taper tree, that o'er the forest tower'd. His talk was with the stars, as one by one, Night, in her queenly regency, put forth Their sprinkled gold upon her sable robe. He knew their places, and pronounc'd their names, And by their heavenly conversation sought. Acquaintance with their Maker. Sang they not Unto his uncloth'd spirit, as it pass'd From sphere to sphere, above their highest ranks, With its attendant angel? We are dark. We ask, and yet no answer. But we trace In clearest lines the shining course he took Among life's duties, for so many years, And hear those parting words, that âall is peace!â The last words of Professor Olmsted. The harvest-song of true philosophy. His epitaph is that which cannot yield A mouldering motto to the tooth of time. âMan works in marble, and it mocks his trust, But the immortal mind doth ever keep The earnest impress of the moulding hand, And bear it onward to a race unborn. âThat is his monument. HERBERT FOSS, Only son of Samuel S. Foss, Esq., died May 23d, 1859, aged three years and three months. âRead more, Papa,â the loving infant cried,â And meekly bow'd the listening ear, and fix'd The ardent eye, devouring every word Of his dear picture book. And then he spread His arms, and folded thrice the father's neck. âThe mother came from church, and lull'd her boy To quiet sleep, and laid him in his crib; And as they watch'd the smile of innocence That sometimes lightly floated o'er his brow That Sabbath eve, they to each other said, âHow beautiful.â There was another scene,â The child lay compass'd round with Spring's white flowers, Yet heav'd no breath to stir their lightest leaf. And many a one who on that coffin look'd And went their way, in tender whisper said âHow beautiful!â Oh parents, ye who sit Mourning for Herbert, in your empty room, What if the darling of your fondest care Scarce woke from his brief dream and went to Heaven? âOur dream is longer, but 'tis mixed with tears. For we are dreamers all, and only those Fully awake, who dwell where naught deceives. So, when time's vision o'er, you reach the land Which hath no need of sun, or waning moon To give it light, how sweet to hear your child Bid you âgood morningâ with his cherub tongue. His last words to his father, who was reading to him in a favorite book, were, âRead, more, papa, please read more.â Soon after, and almost without warning, he died. MRS. CHARLES N. CADWALLADER, Died at Philadelphia, July 2nd, 1859, five weeks after her marriage. The year rolls round, and brings again The bright, auspicious day, The marriage scene, the festive cheer, The group serenely gay, The hopes that nurs'd by sun and shower O'er youth's fair trellis wound, And in that consecrated rite Their full fruition found. But One unseen amid the throng Drew near with purpose fell, And lo! the orange-flowers were changed To mournful asphodel. Five sabbaths walk'd the beautiful Her chosen lord beside, But ere the sixth illumed the sky She was that dread One's bride. Yet call her not the bride of Death Though in his bed she sleeps, And broidering Myrtle richly green O'er her cold pillow creeps: She hath a bower where angels dwell, A mansion with the blest, For Jesus whom she trusted here, Receiv'd her to His rest. REV. DR. JAMES W. ALEXANDER, Pastor of the Fifth Avenue Church, New York, died at the Virginia Springs, July, 1859. The great and good. How startling is the knell That tells he is but dust. The echo comes From where Virginia's health-reviving springs Make many whole. But waiting there for him The dark-winged angel who doth come but once, Troubled the waters, and his latest breath Fled, where his first was drawn. That noble brow So mark'd with intellect, so clear with truth, Grave in its goodness, in its love serene, Will it be seen no more? That earnest voice Filling the Temple-arch so gloriously, With themes of import to the undying soul Enforced by power of fervid eloquence Is it forever mute? That mind so rich With varied learning and with classic lore, Studious, progressive, affluent, profound, That feeling heart, instinct with sympathy For the world's family of grief and pain, The dark in feature, or the lost in sin, Say, are their treasures lost? No, on the page Of many a tome, traced by his tireless pen They live and brighten for a race to come, Prompting the wise, cheering the sorrowful, And for the little children whom he loved Meting out fitting words, like dewy pearls Glittering along their path. His chief delight Was in his Master's work. How well performed Speak ye whose feet upon Salvation's rock Were planted through his prayers. His zeal involved No element of self, but hand in hand Walk'd with humility. He needeth not Praise from our mortal lips. The monuments Of bronze or marble, what are they to him Who hath his firm abode above the stars? âYet may the people mourn, may freshly keep The transcript of his life, nor wrongly ask âWhen shall we look upon his like again?â MRS. JOSEPH MORGAN, Died at Hartford, August, 1859. I saw her overlaid with many flowers, Such as the gorgeous summer drapes in snow, Stainless and fragrant as her memory. Blent with their perfume came the pictur'd thought Of her calm presence,âof her firm resolve To bear each duty onward to its end,â And of her power to make a home so fair, That those who shared its sanctities deplore The pattern lost forever. Many a friend, And none who won that title laid it down, Muse on the tablet that she left behind, Muse,âand give thanks to God for what she was, And what she is;âfor every pain hath fled That with a barb'd and subtle weapon stood Between the pilgrim and the promised Land. But the deep anguish of the filial tear We speak not of,âsave with the sympathy That wakes our own. And so, we bid farewell. Life's sun at setting, may shed brighter rays Than when it rose, and threescore years and ten May wear a beauty that youth fails to reach: The beauty of a fitness for the skies,â Such nearness to the angels, that their song âPeace and good will,â like key-tone rules the soul, And the pure reflex of their smile illumes The meekly lifted brow. She taught us this,â And then went home. MISS ALICE BECKWITH, Died at Hartford, September 23d, 1859. The beautiful hath fled To join the spirit-train; Earth interposed with strong array, Love stretch'd his arms to bar her way, Allâall in vain. There was a bridal hope Before her crown'd with flowers; The orange blossoms took the hue With which the cypress dank with dew Darkeneth our bowers. Affections strong and warm Sprang round her gentle way, Young Childhood, with a moisten'd eye, And Friendship's tenderest sympathy Watch'd her decay. Disease around her couch Long held a tyrant sway, Till vanished from her cheek, the rose, And the fair flesh like vernal snows Wasted away. Yet the dark Angel's touch Dissolv'd that dire control, And where the love-knot cannot break Nor pain nor grief intrusion make, Bore the sweet soul. MARY SHIPMAN DEMING. Died at Hartford, Nov. 11th, 1859, aged 4 years and 6 months. The garner'd Jewel of our heart, The Darling of our tent! Cold rains were falling thick and fast, When forth from us she went. The sweetest blossom on our tree, When droop'd her fairy head, We might not lay her 'mid the flowers, For all the flowers were dead. The youngest birdling of our nest, Her song from us hath fled; Yet mingles with a purer strain That floats above our head. We gaze,âher wings we may not see: We listen,âall in vain: But when this wintry life is o'er, We'll hear her voice again. 1860 REV. DR. F. W. HATCH, Died at Sacramento, California, January 16th, 1860, aged 70. A pleasant theme it is to think of him That parted friend, whose noble heart and mind Were ever active to the highest ends. Even sceptics paid him homage 'mid their doubts, Perceiving that his life made evident A goodness not of earth. His radiant brow. And the warm utterance of his lustrous eye Told how the good of others triumph'd o'er All narrowness of self. He deem'd it not A worthy aim of Christ's true ministry To chaffer for the gold that perisheth Or waste its God-given powers on lifeless forms; But love of souls, and love of Him who died That they might live, gave impulse to his zeal. âAnd so, while half a century chronicled The change of empires, and the fall of kings And death of generations like the leaves That strew the forest 'neath autumnal skies, He toil'd unswerving in that One Great Cause To which the vigor of his youth was given. âAnd as his life, its varied tasks well done Shrouded its head and trustful went to Him Who giveth rest and peace and rich reward Unto his faithful servants, it behooves Us to rejoice who have so long beheld His pure example. From it may we learn Oh sainted Friend, wherever duty calls With fervent hearts to seek for others' good, And wear thy spirit-smile, and win even here Some foretaste of the bliss that ne'er shall end. MRS. PAYNE, Wife of Right Rev. Bishop Payne, died at Monrovia, Liberia. Oh true and faithful! Twice ten earnest years Of mission-toil in Afric's sultry clime Attest thy patience in thy Master's cause, Thy self-denial and humility. Now, neath the shadow of the princely palm, And where Liberia's church-crown'd summits rise, Are sighs from sable bosoms, swelling deep With gratitude for all thy hallow'd care. âThe Prelate, unto whom thy heart of hearts Was link'd so tenderly,âwho found in thee Solace for exile from his native shore, Laments thy loss, as the lone hours go by. He mourns thee deepest, for he knew thee best, Thy purity, thy sublimated search For added holiness. With angel hand Press thou thy pattern on us,âwe who dwell Amid the fullness of the bread from Heaven, Forgetful of our heathen brother's need. Now thou dost sweetly sleep, where pain and woe Follow thee not. Their trial-time is o'er, Their discipline perfected. For thy will Was subjugated to the Will Divine, And through a dear Redeemer's strength, thy soul Hath won the victory. MRS. MARY MILDENSTEIN ROBERTSON, Wife of Rev. William H. C. Robertson, died at Magnolia, East Florida, January 13th, aged 34. Our buds have faded,âwinter's frigid breath Sigh'd o'er their bosoms, and they fell away, So in these household bowers the ice of death Bids rose and lily ere their prime decay, And see a Passion-Flower from tropic skies Beneath our drifted snows, not without requiem lies. A brilliant daughter of the Cuban vales Of generous mind, impulsive, strong and high Twined the home-tendril where our northern gales Sweep grove and forest with their minstrelsy, Labor'd for classic lore with studious part, And planted friendship's germ in many an answering heart. Her filial piety intensely warm Whose gushing tenderness no limit knew, Clasp'd day and night, a Mother's wasted form And o'er her failing powers protection threw, Cheering the darken'd soul with comfort sweet And girding it anew, life's latest pang to meet. Then came the sacred vow for good or ill, The life-long study of another's joy, The raptur'd and unutterable thrill With which a mother greets her first-born boy, The climax of those hopes and duties dear Which Heaven's unerring hand accords to Woman's sphere. And then the scene was ended, and she found What here her ardent nature vainly sought, Unwithering flowers and music's tuneful sound Without a shadow or discordant thought, And entered through a dear Redeemer's love The never-changing clime of perfect rest above. MADAM WILLIAMS, Widow of the late Ezekiel Williams, Esq., and Daughter of Chief Justice Oliver Ellsworth, died at Hartford, February 28th, 1860, aged 87. She was a link that bound us to the past,â To the great days of Washington, when men Loving their country better than themselves Show'd to the world what patriot virtue meant. She on the knee of her majestic sire Drew to her listening heart when life was new Those principles that made his honored name Synonymous with wisdom, and the might Of holy truth. So when in woman's sphere She took her post of duty, still in all The delicate proprieties of life, The inner sanctities of household weal, In social elegance, and in the deeds That christian pity to the poor extends, She was our model; and we saw in her The perfect lady of the olden time. Thus on the pleasant hill-top where she dwelt In her green-terraced home, o'ercanopied By graceful elm, mid evergreens and flowers, The years stole over her, and slowly wrote Their more than fourscore on her faded scroll, While the kind care of unexhausted love Guarded her long decline. And now she sleeps Where thro' the riven snows, the quickening turf Gives emblem of the never-ending Spring, That wraps the accepted soul in robes of joy. SAMUEL G. OGDEN, ESQ., Died at Astoria, New York, April 5th, 1860. Upon his suffering couch he lay, Whose noble form and mind The stress of fourscore years had tried, Yet left a charm behind. The charm of heaven-born happiness Whose beauty may not fade, The charm of unimpair'd regard For all whom God had made. Upon his suffering couch he lay, While sadly gathering there, Were loved and loving ones, who made That honored life their care; And 'mid the group, a daughter's voice Of wondrous sweetness read Brief portions from the Book Divine, As his dictation led. âBow down thine ear, Most Merciful, Oh, hearken while I speak, Now in my time of utmost need, To Thee alone I seek. Shew me some token, Lord, for good, Before I pass away, For Thou hast ever been my strength, My comforter and stay.â The 86th Psalm, one of his favorites, as death drew nigh was often read to him by his daughter, who never left him, day or night, during his sickness, and âout of whose arms,â says one who was present, âwhen he drew his last breath, the angels took him.â So when that precious breath went forth, Her gentle hand was laid To close those pale and trembling lids In slumber's dreamless shade, And then, the pure and sacred flowers She for his burial twined, And bade her struggling grief be still Till the last rite declined. Through every trial change of life Had reign'd within her breast A holy zeal of filial love, That could not be represt; Its memories, like a music strain, Still in that casket swell, And wake perchance, some fond response Where watching angels dwell. MR. GEORGE BEACH, Died at Hartford, May 4th, 1860. Aye, robe yourselves in black, light messengers Whose letter'd faces to the people tell The pulse and pressure of the passing hour. 'Tis fitting ye should sympathize with them, And tint your tablets with a sable hue Who bring them tidings of a loss so great. What have they lost? An upright man, who scorn'd All subterfuge, who faithful to his trust Guarded the interests they so highly prized, With power and zeal unchang'd, from youth to age. Yet there's a sadder sound of bursting tears From woe-worn helpless ones, from widow'd forms O'er whom he threw a shelter, for his name Long mingled with their prayers, both night and morn. The Missionary toward the setting sun Will miss his liberal hand that threw so wide Its secret alms. The sons of want will miss His noble presence moving thro' our streets Intent on generous deeds; and in the Church He loved so well, a silence and a chasm Are where the fervent and responsive voice, And kingly beauty of the hoary head So long maintained their place. Sudden he sank, Though not unwarn'd. A chosen band had kept Watch through the night, and earnest love took note Of every breath. But when approaching dawn Kindled the east, and from the trees that bowered His beautiful abode, awakening birds Sent up their earliest carol, he went forth To meet the glories of the unsetting sun, And hear with unseal'd ear the song of heaven. âSo they who truest loved and deepest mourn'd, Had highest call to praise, for best they knew The soul that had gone home unto its God. MISS MARGARET C. BROWN, Died at Hartford, May 12th, 1860. Gone, pure in heart! unto thy fitting home, Where nought of ill can follow. O'er thy life There swept no stain, and o'er its placid close No shadow. As for us, who saw thee move From childhood onward, loving and serene, To every duty faithful, we who feel The bias toward self too often make Our course unequal, or beset with thorns, Give thanks to Him, the Giver of all good, For what thou wert, but most for what thou art. Thy meek and reverent nature cheer'd the heart Of hoary Age even in thine early bloom, And with sweet tenderness of filial care, And perfect sympathy, thy shielding arm Pillow'd a Mother's head, till life went out We yield thee back, with sound of holy hymns, Flowers in thy hand, and bosom,âparting gifts Of Spring, that makes our earth so beautiful, Faintly prefiguring thine eternal gain Of flowers that never fade and skies that need Not sun nor moon to light them. So farewell, Our grief is selfish, yet it hath its way, Nor can we stand beside thine open grave Without a tear. Yet still doth chasten'd faith Ask help of God, to render back with praise A soul to which He gave the victory. MISS FRANCES WYMAN TRACY, Adopted daughter of Mrs. William Tracy, died at New York, in 1860, aged 17. O young and beautiful, thy step Was light with fairy grace, And well the music of thy voice Accorded with thy face, And blent with those attractive charms How fair it was to see Thy tenderness for her who fill'd A Mother's place to thee. Yet all the pure and holy ties Thus round thy being wove, They are not lost, they are not dead, They have a life above. What though the sleepless care of love Might not avail to save, And sorrow with her dropping tear Keeps vigil o'er thy grave, Faith hath a rainbow for the cloud, A solace for the pain, A promise from the Book Divine To rise, nor part again. DEACON NORMAND SMITH, Died at Hartford, May 22d, 1860, aged 87. One saintly man the less, to teach us how Wisely to live,âone blest example more To teach us how to die. Fourscore and seven, Swept not the beauty of his brow away, Nor quell'd his voice of music, nor impair'd The social feeling that through all his life Ran like a thread of gold. In filial arms Close wrapp'd with watchful tenderness, he trod Jordan's cold brink. The world was beautiful, But Christ's dear love so wrought within his heart That to depart seem'd better. Many a year He lent his influence to the church he loved, For unity and peace, and countless gems Dropp'd from his lips when the last sickness came, To fortify young pilgrims in the course That leads to glory and eternal life. As the frail flesh grew weak, the soul look'd forth With added brightness thro' the clear, dark eye, As though it saw unutterable things, Or heard the welcome of beloved ones Who went to rest before him. So, with smiles, And prayers and holy hymns, and loving words He laid the burden of the body down, And slept in Jesus. MRS. HELEN TYLER BEACH, Wife of Mr. C. N. Beach, died at Philadelphia, July 30th, 1860. How strange that One who yesterday Shed radiance round her sphere, Thus, in the prime of life and health, Should slumber on the bier. How sad that One who cheer'd her home With love's unvarying grace, Should leave at hearth-stone and at board Nought save a vacant place. The beaming hope that bright and fair Around her cradle shone, Made cloudless progress year by year, With lustre all its own, While still unselfish and serene Her daily course she drew, To every generous impulse warm To every duty true: Yet all these pure and hallowed charms To favor'd mortals given, That make their loss to earth so great, Enhance the gain of Heaven. MRS. ELIZABETH HARRIS, Died at Hartford, Sunday evening, September 9th, 1860, aged 80. Oh sorrowing Daughter, left alone In home's deserted sphere, Where every object group'd around, In pleasant room, or garden's bound Is twined by links of sight or sound With the lost Mother dear; Yet take sweet thoughts thy grief to soothe Of what she was below, Her years to faithful duty given, Her comfort in the Book of Heaven, Her ready trust when life was riven, To Christ, her Lord, to go. And take sweet memories of the care That smoothed her couch of pain, The grateful love that o'er her way Kept tender vigil, night and day, And let its pure, reflected ray Thy drooping heart sustain. So shall thy faith the pang assuage That heaves thy mourning breast; For nearer brings each setting sun Their blessed meeting who have won The plaudit of the Judge, âWell done, Come, enter to my rest.â MISS ANNA M. SEYMOUR, Died at Hartford, August 24th, 1860. The beauteous brow, the form of grace, With all their youthful charms, The hand that woke the pencil's power, And bore to penury's lowly bower, The never-wearied alms, The sweet, sweet voice that duly cheer'd A grateful Sabbath train, The uprais'd eye that taught them more Of Heaven, than all their student lore, Must ne'er return again. She took her flight as from the cage Enfranchised warblers glide, Though friends were dear, and life was fair, She saw her Saviour standing there, Beyond rough Jordan's tide. Praise, praise to Him, whose faithful hand Prepared her glorious place, For us is loss,âfor her release, The robe of rest, the home of peace,â For us, the pilgrim race. Praise,âpraise for her,âthough love and grief Still mournful vigil kept,â The tear-wet incense He will take Who at the grave, for friendship's sake, In holy sadness wept. CALEB HAZEN TALCOTT, Son of C. Taloott, Esq., died at Hartford, October 26th, 1860, aged 2 years and 6 months. There came a merry voice Forth from those lips of rose, As tireless through its fringing flowers The tuneful brooklet flows, And with the nurslings feet Engaged in busy play It made the parents' pleasant home A joyance all the day. There breath'd a languid tone Forth from those pallid lips, As when some planet of the night Sinks in its dread eclipse. âSing to me, sing,â it cried, While the red fever reign'd, âOh sing of Jesus,â His request, during his sickness was, âSing to me of Jesus.â it implored While struggling life remained. Then rose a mournful sound, The solemn funeral knell, And silent anguish settled where The nursery's idol fell. But he who so desired His Saviour's name to hear Doth in His glorious presence smile, Above this cloud-wrapp'd sphere. 1861 MISS JANE PENELOPE WHITING, Died at Portland, Connecticut, January 1st, 1861. I think of her unfolding prime, Her childhood bright and fair, The speaking eye, the earnest smile, The dark and lustrous hair, The fondness by a Mother's side To cling with docile mind, Fast in the only sister's hand Her own forever twined, The candor of her trustful youth, The heart that freshly wove Sweet garlands even from thorn-clad bowers, Because it dwelt in love, The stainless life, whose truth and grace Made each beholder see The gladness of a spirit tuned To heavenly harmony. But when this fair New-Year looked forth Over the old one's grave, While bridal pleasures neath her roof Their bright infusion gave, Upon the lightning's wing there came A message none might stay, An angel,âstanding at her side. To bear the soul away. For us, was sorrow's startling shock, The tear, the loss, the pain, For her, the uncomputed bliss Of never-ending gain. MISS ANNA FREEMAN, Died at Mansfield, Connecticut, February, 1861. The world seems drearier when the good depart, The just, the truthful, such as never made Self their chief aim, nor strove with glozing words To counterfeit a love they never felt; But steadfast and sereneâto Friendship gave Its sacred scope, and ne'er from Duty shrank, Though sternest toil and care environ it. These, loving others better than themselves, Fulfill the gospel rule, and taste a bliss While here below, unknown to selfish souls, And when they die, must find the clime where dwells A God of truth, as tend the kindred streams To their absorbing ocean. Such was she Who left us yesterday. Her speaking smile Her earnest footstep hastening to give aid Or sympathy, her ready hand well-skill'd In all that appertains to Woman's sphere, Her large heart pouring life o'er every deed, And her warm interchange of social joy Stay with us as a picture. There, we oft Musing, shall contemplate each lineament With mournful tenderness, through gushing tears, That tell our loss, and her unmeasured gain. MADAM POND, Widow of the late Caleb Pond, Esq., died at Hartford, February 19th 1861, aged 73. Would any think who marked the smile On yon untroubled face, That threescore years and ten had fled Without a wrinkling trace? Yet age doth sometimes skill to guard The beauty of its prime, And hold a quenchless lamp above The water-floods of time. And she, for whom we mourn, maintained Through every change and care, Those hallowed virtues of the soul That keep the features fair. They raised a little child to look Into the coffin deep, Who dream'd the lovely lady lay But in a transient sleep, And gazed upon the face of death With eye of tranquil ray, Well pleased, as with the snowy flowers, That on her bosom lay. Then on the sad procession moved, And mid funereal gloom, The only son was there to lay His mother in the tomb. Oh, memories of an only child, How strong and rich ye are! A wealth of concentrated love That none beside can share. And hence, the filial grief that swells, When breaks its latest tie, Flows onward with a fuller tide Than meets the common eye. With voice of holy prayer she pass'd Forth from her pleasant door, Where tender recollection dwell Though she returns no more. Even so the pure and pious rise From tents of pain and woe, But leave a precious transcript here To guide us where they go. ANNIE SEYMOUR ROBINSON, Daughter of Lucius F. Robinson and Mrs. Eliza S. Robinson, died at Hartford, Wednesday, April 10th, 1861, aged 6 years and 2 months. Dids't hear him call, my beautiful?â The Sire, so fond and dear Who ere the last moon's waning ray, Pass'd in his prime of days away, And hath not left his peer? Say, beckoning from yon silver cloud Though none beside might see, A hand that erst with love and pride Its little daughter's steps would guideâ Stretch'd out that hand for thee? The wreathing buds of snowy rose That o'er thy bosom lay, Were symbols in their beauty pale, Of thy young life so sweet and frail, And all unstain'd as they. Oh stricken hearts!âbear up,âbear on,â Think of your Saviour's grace, Think of the spirit-welcome given, When at the pearly gate of Heaven, Father and child embrace. MRS. GEORGIANA IVES COMSTOCK, Died at Hartford, April 30th, 1861, aged 22. I saw a brilliant bridal. All that cheers And charms the leaping heart of youth was there; And she, the central object of the group, The cherished song-bird of her father's house, Array'd in beauty, was the loved of all. Would I could tell you what a world of flowers Were concentrated thereâhow they o'erflow'd In wreaths and clustersâhow they climb'd and swept From vase to ceiling, with their gay festoons Whispering each other in their mystic lore Of fragrance, and consulting how to swell, As best they might, the tide of happiness. A few brief moons departed and I sought The same abode. There was a gather'd throng Beyond the threshold stone. A few white flowers Crept o'er a bosom and a gentle hand That clasp'd them not. A holy hymn awoke In plaintive melody; but she who breath'd The very soul of music from her birth, Lay there with close-seal'd lips. And the same voice That in the flushing of the autumnal rose Gladly pronounced the irrevocable words âWhat God hath join'd together let no man Asunder put,â now, in the chasten'd tones Of deep humility and tenderness, Strove, from the armory of Heaven, to gird The hearts that freshly bled. At close of day, In the lone, sadden'd hour of musing thought, I seem'd to view a scene where, side by side, Bridals and burials gleam'dâthe smile and tearâ Anguish and joyâpeace in her heavenly vest, And brazen-throated warâand heard a cry, âSuch is man's life below.â I would have wept, Save that a symphony of harps unseen Broke from a hovering cloud; âLo! we are they Who from earth's tribulation rose and found Our robes made white. Henceforth we grieve no more.â List! List! She mingleth in that raptur'd strain Who said so sweetly to her spirit's guide, That the dear Lord whom she had early serv'd Stood near in her extremity, and gave Her soul full willingness to leave a world All bright with beauty, and requited love. And so Death lost his victory, tho' he snatched The unwither'd garland out of Hymen's hand, And wound it in cold mockery round the tomb. WENTWORTH ALEXANDER, Son of Dr. William and Mrs. Mary Wentworth Alexander, died at Fayette, Iowa, May, 1861, aged 2 years. Coming in from play, he laid his head on his mother's bosom, and said âMama, âtake your boy,âboy tired,â and never looked up healthfully again. Boy tired! the drooping infant said, And meekly laid his noble head, Down on that shielding breast, Which mid all change of grief, or wo, Had been his Paradise below, His comforter and rest. Boy tired! Alas for nursing Love, That sleepless toiled and watched and strove, For dire disease portends. Alas for Science and its skill Opposed to his unpitying will This mortal span that rends. Boy tired! So thou hast past away, From heat and burden of the day, From snares that manhood knows,â From want and wo and deadly strife, From wrong, and weariness of life, Hast found serene repose. Boy tired! Those words of parting pain Thou never more wilt breathe again, Nor lift the moaning cry, For naught to wound or vex, or cloy, Invades the cherub home of joy, No shade obscures the sky. O, mother! When above ye meet, When all these years, so few and fleet, Fade like a mist away, This sorrow that thy soul hath bowed, Shall seem but as an April cloud, Before the noon-tide ray. MRS. HARVEY SEYMOUR, Died at Hartford, Sunday, May 5th, 1861. She found a painless avenue to make The great transition from a world of care To one of rest. It was the Sabbath day, And beautiful with smile of vernal sun And the up-springing fragrance from the earth, With all that soothing quietude which links The consecrated season unto Him Who bade the creatures He had made, revere And keep it holy. From her fair abode, Lovely with early flowers, she took her way The second time unto the House of God, And side by side with her life's chosen friend Walk'd cheerfully. Within those hallow'd courts, Where holds the soul communion with its God, She listening sate. But then she lean'd her head Upon her husband's shoulder, and unmark'd By one distorted feature, by the loss Or blanching of the rose-tint on her cheek, Rose to more perfect worship. It might seem As if a sacred temple, purified By prayers and praises, were a place sublime, Of fitting sanctity, wherein to hear The inexpressive call that summoneth The ready spirit upward. But the change In her delightful home, what words can tell! The shock and contrast, when a mind so skill'd With order and efficiency to fill Each post of woman's duty and of love, Vanished from all its daily ministries, And the lone daughter found the guiding voice Silent forevermore. Her's was the heart For an unswerving friendship, warm and true, And self-forgetful; her's the liberal hand To those who pine in cells of poverty, The knowledge of their state, the will to aid, The thought that cared for them, the zeal that blest. Hence, tears o'er rugged cheeks fell fast for her, And the old white-hair'd pensioner knelt down Beside her lifeless clay and cross'd himself, And pour'd his desolate prayer; for her kind heart Saw in the creed of varying sects no bar To charity, but in their time of need Held all as brethren. 'Twas a pleasant spot, Amid fresh verdure, where they laid her down, While the young plants that o'er a daughter's grave Took summer-rooting seemed in haste to reach Forth their incipient roots and tendrils green To broider her turf-pillow. Sleep in peace, Ye, whom the ties of nature closely bound, And death disparted for a little while, Mother and gentle daughter, sleep in peace; Your forms engraven deep on loving hearts, As with a diamond's point, till memory fade. MRS. FREDERICK TYLER, Died at Hartford, Wednesday, June 19th, 1861. They multiply above, with whom we walk'd In tender friendship, and whose steadfast step, Onward and upward, was a guide to us In duty's path. They multiply above, Making the mansions that our Lord prepared And promised His redeemed, more beautiful To us the wayside pilgrims. One, this day Hath gone, whose memory like a loving smile Lingereth behind her. She was skilled to charm And make her pleasant home a cloudless scene Of happiness to children and to guests; But most to him whose heart for many years Did safely trust in her, finding his cares Divided and his pleasures purified. A sweet-voiced kindness, prompting word and deed, Dwelt ever with her; and, when hours of pain Narrowed the scope of her activities, Its radiance comforted the friends who came To comfort her. With soul serenely calm She felt the cherished ties of earth recede That long had bound her in such fond control, And with a hymn upon her whitening lip, A thrilling cadence tremulously sweet, Into the valley of the shade of death Entered unshrinkingly. How blest to rise With song of praise, unto that tuneful choir Whose harps are ne'er unstrung and have no tone Of weary dissonance. The rose of June Was in its flushing, and a few brief moons Had cast upon her lovely daughter's grave Their hallowed lustre, when we laid so low Her perishable part, seeming to hear Their chant of welcome, unto whom the Sun No more goes down, and partings are unknown. MISS LAURA KINGSBURY, Died at Hartford, July, 1861. Faithful and true in duty's sacred sphere, How like the summer-lightning hath she fled! One moment bending o'er the letter'd page,â The next reposing with the silent dead. No more by shaded lamp, or garden fair;â Yet hath she left a living transcript here, Yon helpless orphans will remember her, She was a judicious and faithful manager of the Female Beneficent Society of Hartford. And the young invalid she skilled to cheer; And he who trusted in her from his birth, As to a Mother's love,âand friends who saw Her goodness seeking no applause from earth, But ever steadfast to its heavenly law: For she, like her of old, with listening ear Sate at the Saviour's feet and won His plaudit dear. GOVERNOR JOSEPH TRUMBULL, Died at Hartford, August 4th, 1861; and his wife, Mrs. Eliza Storrs Trumbull, the night after his funeral. Death's shafts fly thick, and love a noble mark. âAnd one hath fallen who bore upon his shield The name and lineage of an honor'd race Who gave us rulers in those ancient days Where truth stood first and gain was left behind. âHis was the type of character that makes Republics strong,âunstain'd fidelity,â A dignity of mind that mark'd unmov'd The unsought honors clustering round his path, And chang'd them into duties. With firm step On the high places of the earth he walk'd, Serving his Country, not to share her spoils, Nor pamper with exciting eloquence A parasite ambition. With clear eye And cautious speech, and judgment never warp'd By fancy or enthusiasm, he pursued An even, upright course. His bounties sought Unostentatious channels, and he loved To help the young who strove to help themselves, Aiding their oar against opposing tides, Into the smooth, broad waters. Thus flow'd on His almost fourscore years,âlevying slight tax On form or mind, while self-forgetful still, He rose to prop the sad, or gird the weak. âYet, when at last, in deep repose he lay, His classic features, and unfurrow'd brow, Wearing the symmetry of earlier days Which Death, as if relenting, render'd back In transitory gleam, 'twas sweet to hear His aged Pastor at the coffin-side Bearing full tribute to his piety So many lustrums, that consistent faith Which nerv'd his journey and had led him home. Home?âYes! Give thanks, ye, who still travel on, Oft startled, as some pilgrim from your side Falls through the arches of Time's broken bridge Without a warning, and is seen no moreâ Give thanks that he is safe,âat home,âin heaven. Back to the grave, from whence ye scarce have turn'd, Break up the clods on which the dews of night But twice had rested. Lo! another comes. She, who for many years had garner'd up Her heart's chief strength in him, finding his love Armor and solace, in all weal or woe, Seem'd the world poor without him, that she made Such haste to join him in the spirit-land? Through the dark valley of the shade of death, Treading so close behind him? Scarce his lip Learn'd the new song of heaven, before she rose To join the enraptur'd strain. Her earthly term Of fair and faithful duty well perform'd, In fear of God, and true good will to man, How blessed thus to enter perfect rest, Where is no shadow of infirmity, Nor fear of change, but happy souls unite In high ascriptions to redeeming Love. And thou, Mrs. Eliza S. Robinson, the only child of Governor and Mrs. Trumbull, whose early life, had been a scene of singularly unbroken felicity, was appointed to a fearful contrast of rapid and severe bereavements. Her noble husband, Lucius F. Robinson, Esq., in the midst of his days and usefulness, was suddenly smitten,âimmediately after, their beautiful child, Annie Seymour,âthen her distinguished relative, Chief Justice Storrs, who from her birth had regarded her with a fatherly love; and then both her parents, side by side, almost hand in hand, passed to the tomb. With unsurpassed calmness, she met this whelming tide of sorrow, girding herself to her maternal duties, in the armor of a disciple of Jesus Christ. Yet with little warning, she was herself soon summoned to follow those beloved ones, dying in August, 1862, at the age of 35, leaving three orphan daughters, and a large circle of friends to lament the loss of her beautiful example of every christian grace and virtue. sole daughter of their house and heart, Leading thy mournful little ones to look Into the open and insatiate tomo, With what a rushing tide thy sorrows came. âThe sudden smiting, in his glorious prime Of him who held the key of all thy joys,â The fair child following him,âthe noble Friend Who watch'd thee with parental pride,âand now Father and Mother have forsaken thee. âThe lessons of a life-long pilgrimage Thou hast achiev'd, while yet a few brief moons With waning finger, as in mockery wrote Of treasur'd hopes, more fleeting than their own. âBut mays't thou from these sterner teachings gain A higher seat, where no o'ershadowing cloud Veileth the purpose of God's discipline. And mid their glad embrace,âthe gone before,â The re-united ne'er to part,âbehold The teaching of no bitter precept lost, Nor tear-sown seed fail of its harvest crown. MRS. EMILY ELLSWORTH, Wife of Governor Ellsworth, and daughter of Noah Webster, LL. D., died at Hartford, August 23d, 1861. Not with the common forms of funeral grief We mourn for her who in the tomb this day Taketh her narrow couch. For we have need Of such example as she set us here, The sphere of christian duty beautified By gifts of intellect, and taste refined; A precious picture, set in frame of gold And hung on high. Hers was a life that bore The test of scrutiny, and they who saw Its inner ministration, day by day, Bore fullest witness to its symmetry, Its delicate tissues, and unwavering crown Of piety. A heritage of fame, And the rich culture of her early years Wrought no contempt for woman's household care, But gave it dignity. Order was hers, And system, and an industry that weighed The priceless value of each fleeting hour. Hers was a charm of manner felt by all, A reference for authorities that marked The olden time, and that true courtesy Which made the aged happy. Scarce it seemed That she was of their number, or the links Of threescore years and ten, indeed had wound Their coil around her, with such warmth the heart, And cloudless mind retained their energies. Beauty and grace were with her to the last, And fascination that withheld the guest Beyond the allotted time. More would we say, But her affections 'tis not ours to touch In lays so weak. He of their worth might tell, Whose dearest hopes so long with hers entwined, And they who shared the intense maternal love, That knew no pause of effort, no decay, No weariness, but glazed the dying eye With heaven-born lustre. So, we bid farewell; Friend and Exemplar, we who tread so close In thine unechoing footsteps. Be thy faith As strong for us, when we the bridge shall pass To the grand portal of Eternity. REV. STEPHEN JEWITT, D. D., Died at New Haven, August 25th, 1861, aged 78. I well remember him, and heard his voice In vigorous prime, beneath the Temple-Arch, His brow enkindling with its holy themes. And I remember to have heard it said In what a patient studiousness of toil His youth had pass'd, and how his manhood's tent Spread out its curtains joyously, to shield His aged parents, from their lonely home Amid the glory of the Berkshire hills, Turning in tender confidence to him; And giving scope to earn the boon that crowns The fifth commandment of the decalogue. âAnd this he did, for their departing prayer Fell balmily upon his filial heart, As when the dying Jacob, blessed his race And worshipp'd, leaning on his patriarch-staff. âHis lengthened life amid a peaceful scene Flow'd on, with loving memories. He had serv'd The Church he lov'd, not in luxurious ease, But self-forgetful as a pioneer, When she had fewer sons to build her walls, Or teach her gates salvation. And the dome Of yon fair College on its classic heighth So beautiful without, and blest within,â By liberal deeds, as well as gracious words Remembereth him and with recording pen Upon the tablet of its earliest The Rev. Dr. Jewitt was the first founder of a scholarship in Trinity College, Hartford, a quarter of a century since. friends Engraves his name. So, full of honor'd years, Blessing and blest, he took his way, above. MISS DELIA WOODRUFF GODDING, A faithful Teacher of the young from early years, and recently the Principal of a Female Seminary and Boarding School at St. Anthony, Minnesota, died suddenly of an attack of fever, while on a visit at her paternal home in Vermont, September, 15th, 1861. Thine earnest life is over, sainted Friend! And hush'd the teaching voice that gladly pour'd Knowledge and goodness o'er the plastic mind. âFull many a pupil of thy varied lore Amid thine own New-England's elm-crowned vales Holds thee in tenderness of grateful thought, And far away in the broad-featured west Where the strong Sire of waters robes in green The shores of Minnesota, comes a wail From youthful bands expecting thy return, To guide them, as the shepherd leads the lamb. They watch in vain. The pleasant halls are dark Once lighted by thy smile, and flowing tears Reveal the love that linger'd there for thee. Said we thy life was o'er? Forgive the words. We take them back. Thou hast begun to live. Here was the budding, there the perfect flower, Here the faint star, and there the unsetting sun, Here the scant preface, there the open Book Where angels read forever. Here on the threshold, the dim vestibule Thou with a faithful hand didst toil to tune That harp of praise within the unfolding heart Which 'neath the temple-arch not made with hands Swells the full anthem of Eternity. MISS SARA K. TAYLOR, Died at Hartford, October 23d, 1861, aged 20. How beautiful in death The young and lovely sleeper liesâ Sweet calmness on the close-sealed eyes, Flowers o'er the snowy neck and brow Where lustrous curls profusely flow; If 'twere not for the icy chill That from her marble hand doth thrill, And for her lip that gives no sound, And for the weeping all around, How beautiful were death. How beautiful in life! Her pure affections heavenward moving, Her guileless heart so full of loving, Her joyous smile, her form of grace, Her clear mind lighting up the face, And making home a blessed place, Still breathing thro' the parents' heart A gladness words could ne'er impart, A faith that foil'd affliction's dartâ How beautiful her life. Gone to the Better Land! Before the world's cold mist could shade The brightness on her spirit laid, Before the autumnal breeze might fray One leaflet from her wreath away, Or crisp one tendril of the vine That hope and happiness did twineâ Goneâin the soul's unfaded bloom That dreads no darkness of the tombâ Gone to the Better Land. MR. JOHN WARBURTON, Died at Hartford, November, 1861. The knot of crape upon yon stately door, And sadness brooding o'er the sun-bright halls, What do they signify? Death hath been there Where truth and goodness hand in hand with love Walk'd for so many years. Death hath been there, To do mid flowing tears his mighty work, Extinguishing the tyranny of pain And taking the immortal essence home Where it would be. Yet is there left behind A transcript that we cherish, and a chasm We have no power to fill. Almost it seems That we beheld him still, with quiet step Moving among us, saintly and serene, Clear-sighted, upright, held in high regard, Yet meekly unambitious, seeking nought Of windy honor from the mouth of men But with the Gospel's perfect code content, Breathing good-will to all. Freely his wealth Wrought blessed channels mid the sons of need, Lending Philanthropy and Piety A stronger impulse in their mission-course To ameliorate and save. So, thus intent On higher deeds and aims than earth supplies, An adept in that true philosophy Learnt only in Christ's school, he calmly went Unto his Master and the Class above. REV. HENRY ALBERTSON POST, Died at Warrensburgh, New York, November 12th, 1861, aged 26. His request of his wife during the sufferings of an acute dyptheria, which suddenly separated him from an attached people, was, âRead me rejoicing Psalms.â Read me rejoicing Psalms, Oh dearest one, and best! I go from war to peace, From pain to glorious rest, Where the bright life-tree sheds Around its precious balms, So, while I linger her Read me rejoicing psalms. And when my place I take Amid the ransom'd throng Who through a Saviour's love Uplift the immortal song, Repress the tear of grief That washes faith away, And brave in zeal and love Await our meeting-day. Yes, let thy course below Through all its fleeting days In its angelic ministries Be as a psalm of praise. MISS CAROLINE L. GRIFFIN, Died at New York, November 17th, 1861. WRITTEN ON HER BIRTH-DAY. The day returns, beloved friend When in thy Mother's arms Thou a fair gift from Heaven wert laid In all thine infant charms, That day, with cloudless sky returns, But yet thou art not here And from the smitten Mother's eye Distils the mourner's tear. The wondrous brightness of thy smile, Thy tones of greeting kind, The love of knowledge that inspired Thy strong and ardent mind, Thy pity for the suffering poor, Thy patient zeal to teach Their children, though in manners rude And ignorant in speech, And all thy many deeds and words Of friendships earnest part, Are with a never-fading trace Depictured on my heart. But thou art with that Saviour dear Who was thine early choice, And mid thy blooming youth didst bend A listener to His voice, So thy firm faith without a fear Launch'd forth on Jordan's wave The victor-palm-branch in thy hand That o'er stern Death He gave; And may we meet, beloved friend At God's appointed day Where every care and pain of earth Have fled like dreams away. MR. NORMAND BURR, Editor of the âChristian Secretaryâ for more than twenty years, died at Hartford, December 5th, aged 59. We knew him as a man of sterling worth, Whose good example is a legacy Better than gold for those he leaves behind. âHis inborn piety flowed forth in streams Of social kindness and domestic love, Cheering with filial warmth the parents' heart, And making his own home a pleasant place. âHis was that self-reliant industry, Smiling at hardship, which develops well The energies of manhood, and lends strength To commonwealths. By silent messenger, A weekly scroll, he strove to spread abroad The stores of knowledge, and increase the fruits Of righteousness. Hence is his loss bemoan'd By many who had never seen his face Here in the flesh, but thro' the links of thought Held intimate communion. The true life Of virtue, is not lost to men below, Though smitten by the frost of death it fall,â Its quickening memory survives, to gird On in the heavenward race, and gently guide Where the high plaudit of the Judge is won. HON. THOMAS S. WILLIAMS, Late Chief Justice of Connecticut, died at Hartford, on Sunday morning, December 15th, 1861, aged 84. 'Tis not for pen and ink, Or the weak measures of the muse, to give Fit transcript of his virtues who hath risen Up from our midst this day. And yet 'twere sad If such example were allow'd to fleet Without abiding trace for those behind. To stand on earth's high places in the garb Of Christian meekness, yet to comprehend And track the tortuous policies of guile With upright aim, and heart immaculate, To pass just sentence on the wiles of fraud, And deeds of wickedness, yet freshly keep The fountain of good-will to all mankind, To mark for more than fourscore years, a line Of light without a mist, are victories Not oft achiev'd by frail humanity, Yet were they his. Of charities that knew No stint or boundary, save the woes of man He wish'd no mention made. But doubt ye not Their record is above. Without the tax That age doth levy, on the eye or ear, Movement of limbs, or social sympathies, In sweet retirement of domestic joy His calm, unshadow'd pilgrimage was closed By an unsighing transit. Our first wintry morn Lifted its Sabbath face, and saw him sit All reverent, at the table of his Lord, And heard that kindly modulated voice Teaching Heaven's precepts to a youthful class Which erst with statesman's eloquence controll'd A different audience. The next holy day Wondering beheld his place at church unfill'd, And found him drooping in his peaceful home, Guarded by tenderest love. But on the third, While the faint dawn was struggling to o'ercome The lingering splendors of a full-orb'd moon, The curtains of his tent were gently raised And he had gone,âgone,âmourn'd by every heart Among the people. They had seen in him The truth personified, and felt the worth Of such a Mentor. 'Twere impiety To let the harp of praise in silence lie, We who beheld so beautiful a life Complete its perfect circle. Praise to Him Who gave him power in Christ's dear name to pass Unharm'd, the dangerous citadel of time, Unsullied, o'er its countless snares to rise From earthly careâto rest,âfrom warâto peace,â From chance and change,âto everlasting bliss. Give praise to God. COLONEL H. L. MILLER, Died at Hartford, December 30th, 1861. Sorrow and Joy collude. One mansion hears The children shouting o'er their Christmas Tree, While in the next resound the widow's wail And weeping of the fatherless. So walk Sickness and health. One rounds the cheek at morn, The other with a ghost-like movement glides Unto the nightly couch, and lo! the wheels Of life drive heavily, and all its springs Revolving in mysterious mechanism Are troubled. And how slight the instrument That sometimes sends the strong man to his tomb, Revealing that the glory of his prime, Is as the flower of grass. Of this we thought When looking on the face that lay so calm And comely in its narrow coffin-bed, Remembering how the months of pain that sank His manly vigor to an infant's sigh Were met unmurmuringly. Dense was the throng That gather'd to his obsequies,âand well The Pastor's prayer of faith essayed to gird The smitten hearts that whelm'd in sorrow mourn'd Husband and sire, whose ever-watchful love Guarded their happiness. Slowly moved on The long procession, led by martial men Who deeply in their patriot minds deplored Their fallen compeer, and bade music lay With plaintive voice, her chaplet down beside His open grave. Then, the first setting sun Of our New-Year, cast off his wintry frown, And seemed to write in clear, long lines of gold Upon the whiten'd earth, the glorious words, So shall the dead arise, at the last trump, Sown here in weakness, to be raised in power, Sown in corruption, to put on the robes Of immortality. Praise be to Him Who gives through Christ our Lord, to dying flesh Such victory. 1862 COLONEL SAMUEL COLT, Died at Hartford, on Friday morning, January 10th, 1862. And hath he fallen,âwhom late we saw In manly vigor bold? That stately form,âthat noble face, Shall we no more behold?â Not now of the renown we speak That gathers round his name, For other climes beside our own Bear witness to his fame; Nor of the high inventive power That stretched from zone to zone, And 'neath the pathless ocean wrought,â For these to all are known;â Nor of the love his liberal soul His native City bore, For she hath monuments of this Till memory is no more; Nor of the self-reliant force By which his way he told, Nor of the Midas-touch that turn'd All enterprise to gold, And made the indignant River yield Unto the ozier'd plain,â For these would ask a wider range Than waits the lyric strain: We choose those unobtrusive traits That dawn'd with influence mild, When in his noble Mother's arms We saw the noble child, And noted mid the changeful scenes Of boyhood's sport or strife, That quiet, firm and ruling mind Which marked advancing life. So onward as he held his course Through hardship to renown, He kept fresh sympathy for those Who cope with fortune's frown, The kind regard for honest toil, The joy to see it rise, The fearless truth that never sought His frailties to disguise, The lofty mind that all alone Gigantic plans sustain'd, Yet turned unboastfully away From fame and honors gained; The tender love for her who blest His home with angel-care, And for the infant buds that rose In opening beauty fair. Deep in the heart whence flows this lay, Is many a grateful trace Of friendship's warm and earnest deed Which nought can e'er replace; For in the glory of his prime The pulse forsakes his breast, And by his buried little ones He lays him down to rest. And thousand stand with drooping head Beside his open grave, To whose industrious, faithful hands, The daily bread he gave, The daily bread that wife and babe Or aged parent cheer'd, Beneath the pleasant cottage roofs, Which he for them had rear'd. There's mourning in the princely halls So late with gladness gay, A tear within the heart of love That will not dry away; A sense of loss on all around, A sigh of grief and painâ âThe like of him we lose to day, We ne'er shall see again.â MADAM HANNAH LATHROP, Died in Norwich, Connecticut, January 18th, 1862, aged 92. Had I an artist's pencil, I might sketch Her as she was, in her young matronhood Graceful and dignified, serene and fair. âI well remember, when at Sabbath-morn, With pious zeal, the rural church she sought, Our rural church,âby rocks o'er-canopied,â Where with her stately husband and their group Of younglings bright, each in the accustom'd seat, How many a glance was toward her beauty bent Admiringly. In those primeval days The aristocracy that won respect, Sprang not from wealth alone, but laid its base In goodness and in virtue. Thus she held Her healthful influence in society Without gainsaying voice. The polity Of woman's realm,âsweet home,âthose inner cares And countless details that promote its peace, Prosperity and order, were not deem'd Beneath the highest then, nor wholly left To hireling hands. This science she upheld, And with her circle of accomplishments And charms so mingled it, that all combined Harmoniously. That energy and grace So often deem'd the exclusive property Of youth's fresh season, or of vigorous prime, She brought to Age, an unencumbered dower, Making the gift of being beautiful, Even beyond ninety years. And though the change Of mortal life, dispers'd her cherish'd band, And some had gone their own fair nests to build And some arisen to mansions in the skies Alone, yet undismay'd, her post she kept, Guiding a household in the same good ways Of order and of hospitality. So, when with mild decline, the sunset came, Her powers still unimpair'd, all willingly As a confiding and obedient child Goes to its father's house, she went above. HENRIETTA SELDEN COLT, Daughter of Col. Samuel and Mrs. Elizabeth Colt, died January 20th, 1862, aged 7 months and 27 days. THE MOURNING MOTHER. A tomb for thee, my babe! Dove of my bosom, can it be? But yesterday in all thy charms, Laughing and leaping in my arms, A tomb and shroud for thee! A couch for thee mine own, Beneath the frost and snow! So fondly cradled, soft and warm, And sheltered from each breath of storm, A wintry couch for thee! Thy noble father's there, But the last week he died, He would have stretched his guarding arm, To shelter thee from every harm, Nestle thee to his side. Thy ruby lip skill'd not That father's name to speak, Yet wouldst thou pause mid infant play To kiss his picture when away, The love smile on thy cheek. Thy brother slumbereth there, Our first-born joy was he, Thy little sister sweetly fair, Most like a blessed bird of air; A goodly company. Only one left with me, One here and three above, Be not afraid my precious child! The Shepherd of the lambs is mild,â Sleep in His love. Thou never saw'st our Spring Unfold the blossoms gay; But thou shalt see perennial bowers, Enwreathed with bright and glorious flowers, That cannot fade away. And thou shalt join the song, That happy cherubs pour, In their adoring harmonies: I'll hear ye, darlings, when I rise To that celestial shore. Yes, there's a Saviour dear,â Keep down, oh tears, that swell! A righteous God who reigns above, Whose darkest ways are truth and love, He doeth all things well. THE LITTLE BROTHERS. William Childs Brewer, died Jan. 24th, 1862, aged 7 years, and George Cleveland Brewer, aged 5 years, at Springfield, Mass., Feb. 4th, 1862. The noble boy amid his sports Droop'd like a smitten flower That feels the frost-king's fatal shaft, And withers in its bower. But then a younger darling sank In childhood's rosy bloom, And those whose hearts were one from birth, Were brothers in the tomb. Not in the tomb. Ah no! They rose Through Christ their Saviour's love, In his blest presence to cement Their deathless bond of love. Are they not dwelling side by side? Have they not 'scaped the strife, The snares, the sins, the woes that stain This pilgrimage of life? Oh heart of sorrowing Love, be strong! Tho' tenderest ties are riven, For do not earth's bereavments aid The angel-chant of Heaven. MR. DAVID F. ROBINSON, Died at Hartford, January 26th, 1862, aged 61. We did not think it would be so;â We kept The hope-lamp trimm'd and burning. Day by day There came reports to cheer us;âand we thought God in his goodness would not take away So soon, another of that wasting band Of worthies, whose example in our midst, Precious and prized, we knew not how to spare. These were our thoughts and prayers;â But He who reigns Above the clouds had different purposes. On the low pillow where so late he mourn'd His gifted first-born, in the prime of days, Circled by all that makes life beautiful And full of joy, his honored head is laid,â The Sire and Son,âne'er to be sunder'd more. Yet his unblemish'd memory still survives, And walks among us;âthe upright intent,â Firmness that conquer'd obstacles,âthe zeal For public good,âthe warmth of charity, And piety, that gave unwithering root To every virtue. Or the pleasant home Where his most fond affections shed their balm And found response,ânow in its deep eclipse And desolate, it is not ours to speak; Nor by a powerless sympathy invade The sacredness of grief. 'Twere fitter far For faith to contemplate that glorious Home Which knows no change, and lose itself in praise Of Him, who to His faithful followers gives Such blessed passport o'er the flood of Death, That âwhere He is, there shall His servant be.â MR. SAMUEL TUDOR, Died at Hartford, January 29th, 1862, aged 92. We saw him on a winter's day, Beneath the hallowed dome, Where for so many years his heart Had found its Sabbath-home, Yet not amid his ancient seat Or in the accustomed place Arose his fair, and reverend brow, And form of manly grace. Then Music, through the organ's soul Melodious descant gave, But yet his voice so rich and sweet Swell'd not the sacred stave, The Christmas wreaths o'er arch and nave Were lingering still to cheer His parting visit to the fane Which he had help'd to rear. And flowers were on the coffin-lid And o'er his bosom strown, Fit offering for the friend who loved The plants of every zone, And bade them in his favor'd cell Unfold their charms sublime, And felt the florist's genial joy Repel the frost of time. No cloud of sorrow marr'd his course, Save when her loss he wept, Whose image in his constant soul Its angel presence kept, But heavenly Mercy's balm was shed To cheer his lonely breast, For tenderest love in filial hearts His latest moments blest. And so, for more than ninety years Flow'd on his cloudless span, In love of Nature, and of Art, And kindred love for man, Our oldest patriarch, kind and true, To all our City dear, His cordial tones, his greeting words No more on earth we hear. Last of that band of noble men Who for their Church's weal Took counsel in her hour of need And wrought with tireless zeal, Nor in their fervent toil declined Nor loiter'd on their ways, Until her Gothic towers arose And her full chant of praise. But as we laid him down with tears, The westering Sun shone bright, And through the ice-clad evergreens Diffused prismatic light, Type of the glory that awaits The rising of the just, And so, we left him in the grave That Christ his Lord had blest. HENRY HOWARD COMSTOCK, Youngest child of the late Capt. John C. Comstock, died at Hartford, February 11th, 1862, a fortnight after his father, aged 11 months. It was a fair and mournful sight Once at the wintry tide, When to the dear baptismal rite Was brought an infant, sweet and bright, His father's couch beside, His dying father's couch beside, Whose eye, with tranquil ray, Beheld upon that beauteous head The consecrated water shed, Then calmly pass'd away. A little while the lovely babe, As if by angels lent, With soft caress and soothing wile Invok'd a widow'd mother's smile, Then to his father went. Christ's holy seal upon his brow, Christ's sign upon his breast, He 'scaped from all the cares and woes That earth inflicts or manhood knows, And enter'd with the blest. REV. DR. DAVID SMITH, For many years Pastor of a Church in Durham, Conn., died at Fair Haven, March 3d, 1862, aged 94. The transcript of a long, unblemish'd life Replete with happiness and holiness, Is a fair page to look upon with love In this world's volume oft defaced by sin, And marr'd with misery. And he, who laid His earthly vestments down this day, doth leave Such tablet for the heart. 'Twas good to see That what he preach'd to others, he portray'd Before them in example, that the eye Adding its stronger comment to the ear, Might lend new impulse to the flock he led Toward the Great Shepherd's fold. Along his path Sorrows he met, but such as wrought him gain, And joys that made not weak his hold on heaven, But touch'd his brow with sunbeams, and his heart With warmer charity. Year after year, Home's duties and its hospitalities Were blent with cheerfulness, and when the chill Of hoary Time approach'd he took no part In that repulsive criticism of age, Pronouncing with a frown, the former days Better than these. The florid glow that tints The cheek of health, which youth perchance, accounts Its own peculiar beauty, dwelt with him Till more than fourscore years and ten achiev'd Their patriarch circle, while the pleasant smile And genial manner, casting light around His venerable age, conspired to make His company desirable to all. And so beloved on earth and waited for Above, he closed this mortal pilgrimage In perfect peace. MISS EMILY B. PARISH, Formerly a Teacher in Hartford, died at Cleveland, Ohio, March 12th, 1862. Teachers,âshe is not here With the first breath of Spring Her aid to your devoted band With cheering smile and ready hand Untiringly to bring. Pupils,âher guiding voice, Her sweetly warbled strain, Urging your spirits to be wise With daily, tuneful harmonies Ye shall not hear again. Parents,âand loving friends The parents' heart who shared, Give thanks to that abounding grace Which led her through the Christian race, To find its high reward. Lover,âthe spell is broke That o'er your life she wove, Look to her flitting robes that gleam So white, beyond cold Jordan's stream, Look to the Land of Love. HARRIET ALLEN ELY, Died at Providence, Rhode Island, April 27th, 1862, aged 7 years and 2 months. Seven blest years our darling daughter, We have held thee to our hearts, Every season growing dearer; We have held thee near and nearer, Never dreaming thus to part. Seven brief yearsâour only daughterâ Sweet has been the parent rule, Infant watch by cradle nightly, 'Till we saw thy footsteps lightly Tripping joyously to school. Germ of promise,âbud of beauty, To our tenderest nurture given, Not for our too dim beholding Was thy fair and full unfolding; That perfection is in Heaven. Earth no license had to harm thee, Time no power to touch thy bloom, Holy is our faith to meet thee, Glorious is our trust to greet thee Far beyond the conquering tomb. MISS CATHARINE BALL, Daughter of Hon. Judge Ball of Hoosick Falls, N. Y., died at the City of Washington, 1862. Bright sunbeam of a father's heart Whose earliest radiance shone Delightful o'er a mother's eye Like morning-star in cloudless sky, Say, whither hast thou flown? Fair inmate of a happy home Whose love so gently shed Could a serene enchantment make And love in stranger bosoms wake, Ah, whither art thou fled? They know, who trust the Saviour's word With faith no tear can dim, That such as bear His spirit here And do His will in duty's sphere Shall rise to dwell with Him. They know, who feel an Angel near, Though hid from mortal sight And reaching out to her their hand Shall safer reach that Pleasant Land Whose buds no blast can blight. Even I, who but with fleeting glance Beheld thee here below, From its remembered sweetness gain New impulse toward that heavenly train Whose harps in never-ceasing strain With God's high praises glow. MRS. MORRIS COLLINS, Died at Hartford, May 19th, 1862. Frail stranger at the gate of life, Too weak to grasp its key, O'er whom the Sun on car of gold Hath but a few times risen and roll'd, Unnoticed still by thee,â To whom the toil of breath is new, In this our vale of time Whose feet are yet unskill'd to tread The grassy carpet round thee spread At the soft, vernal prime,â Deep sympathy and pitying care Regard thy helpless moan, And 'neath thy forehead arching high Methinks, the brightly opening eye Doth search for something gone. Yon slumberer 'mid the snowy flowers, With young, unfrosted hair, Awakes not at the mournful sound Of bird-like voices murmuring round âWhy sleeps our Mother there?â Hers was that sunshine of the heart, Which Home's fair region cheer'd, Hers the upright, unselfish aim, The fond response to duty's claim, The faith that never fear'd. Oh mystery! brooding oft so dark O'er this our path below, Not ours, with wild, repining sigh, To ask the wherefore, or the why, But drink our cup of woe. So, in her shrouded beauty cold, Yield to the earth its own, Assured that Heaven will guard the trust, Of that which may not turn to dust, But dwells beside the Throne. MRS. MARGARET WALBRIDGE, Died at Saratoga, N. Y., June 2d, 1862, aged 35. WRITTEN ON HER BIRTH-DAY. This was her birth-day here, When summer's latest flowers Were kindling to their flush and prime, As if they felt how short the time In these terrestrial bowers. She hath a birth-day now No hastening night that knows, She hath a never-ending year Which feels no blight of autumn sere, Nor chill of wintry snows. She hath no pain or fear, But by her Saviour's side Expansion finds for every power; And knowledge her angelic dower An ever-flowing tide. They sorrow, who were called From her sweet smile to part, Who wore her love-links fondly twined Like woven threads of gold refined Around their inmost heart. Tears are upon the cheeks Of little ones this day, God of the motherless,âwhose eye Notes even the ravens when they cry Wipe Thou their tears away: Oh, comfort all who grieve Beside the sacred urn,â For brief our space to wail or sigh, Like grass we fade, like dreams we fly, And rest with those we mourn. THE BROTHERS. Mr. Fisher Ames Buell, died at Hartford, May 19th, 1861, aged 25, and Mr. Henry R. Buell, on his voyage to Europe, June 20th, 1862, aged 30, the only children of Mr. Robert and Mrs. Laura Buell. Both gone. Both smitten in their manly prime, Yet the fair transcript of their virtues here, And treasured memories of their boyhood's time Allay the anguish of affection's tear. One hath his rest amid the sacred shade Whose turf reveals the mourner's frequent tread, And one beneath the unfathomed deep is laid To slumber till the sea restores her dead. The childless parents weep their broken trust, Hope's fountain failing at its cherish'd springs, And widow'd sorrow shrouds herself in dust, While one lone flowret to her bosom clings. Yet no blind chance this saddening change hath wrought, No dark misrule this mortal life attends, A Heavenly Father's never-erring thought Commingles with the discipline He sends. Not for His reasons let us dare to ask, His secret counsels not aspire to read, But faithful bow to each allotted task And make His will our solace and our creed. HON. PHILLIP RIPLEY, Died at Hartford, July 8th, 1862, aged 68. It is not meet the good and just Oblivious pass away, And leave no record for their race, Except a dim and fading trace, The memory of a day. We need the annal of their course, Their pattern for a guide,â Their armor that temptation quell'd,â The beacon-light that forth they held O'er Time's delusive tide. Within the House of God I sate At Summer's morning ray,â And sadly mark'd a vacant seat Where erst in storm, or cold or heat While lustrums held their way, Was ever seen with reverent air Intent on hallow'd lore, A forehead edg'd with silver hair, A manly form bow'd low in prayer,â They greet our eyes no more. And where Mr. Ripley was a persevering friend and patron of the State Reform School at West Meriden. He had long sustained the office of Trustee for the County of Hartford, and was at the time of his death, the Chairman of that body, and a prominent member of its Executive Committee. His frequent visits to that Institution, his attention to all its internal concerns, and earnest satisfaction in its prosperity, entitle him to its grateful remembrance. Philanthropy commands Her lighted lamp to burn, And youthful feet inured to stray Are wisely warn'd to duty's way, Repentant to return, He, with a faith that never fail'd, Its first inception blest,â And year by year, with zeal untired, Wise counsel lent,ânew hopes inspired, And righteous precepts prest. They did him honor at his grave, Those men of mystic sign, Whose ancient symbols bright and fair, The Book, the Level, and the Square, Betoken truth benign: All do him honor, who regard Integrity sincere, But they who knew his virtues best, While fond remembrance rules the breast, Will hold his image dear. RICHARD ELY COLLINS, Son of Mr. Morris Collins, died at Wethersfield, September 5th, 1862, aged 3 months and 27 days. It was a sad and lovely sight They call'd us to behold, That infant forehead high and fair, Those beauteous features sculptured rare, Yet breathless all, and cold. Heard it in dreams, an angel voice Soft as the zephyr's tone? The yearning of a Mother mild To clasp once more her three months' child But a few days her own? Just a few days of wasting pain She linger'd by its side, And then consign'd to stranger arms The frail unfolding of the charms She would have watch'd with pride. Yet happy babe! to reach a home Beyond all sorrowing cares, Where none a Mother's loss can moan Or seek for bread, and find a stone, Or fall in fatal snares. Thrice happy,âto have pass'd away Ere Time's sore ills invade,â From fragrant buds that drooping shed Their life-sigh o'er thy coffin-bedâ To flowers that never fade. MISS ELIZABETH BRINLEY, Died at Hartford, September 28th, 1862. We miss her at the chancel-side, For when we last drew near, The holy Eucharist to share, She, with the warmth of praise and prayer Was meekly kneeling here. We miss her when the liberal hand Relieves a thirsting soil, And when the Blessed Church demands Assistance for the mission bands That on her frontier toil. We miss her 'mid the gather'd train Of children The well-conducted Industrial School in connection with St. Paul's Church where she had been for several years an indefatigable and valued teacher. young and poor, Whom year by year she deign'd to teach With faithful zeal and patient speech, And hope that anchor'd sure. Her couch is in the ancestral tomb With Putnam's honor'd dust, The true in word, the bold in deed, A bulwark in his Country's need, A tower of strength and trust. Her spirit's home is with her Lord, Whom from her youth she sought, The miss'd below hath found above The promise of a God of Love Made to the pure in thought. MR. JOHN A. TAINTOR, Died at Hartford, on Saturday Evening, November 15th, 1862, aged 62 years. A sense of loss is on us. One hath gone Whose all-pervading energy doth leave A void and silence 'mid the haunts of men And desolation for the hearts that grieve In his fair mansion, so bereft and lone, Whence the inspiring smile, and cheering voice have flown. Those too there are who eloquently speak Of his firm friendship, not without a tear, Of its strong power to undergird the weak And hold the faltering feet in duty's sphere, While in the cells of want, a broken trust In bitterness laments, that he is of the dust. In foreign climes, with patriotic eye He sought what might his Country's welfare aid, And the rich flocks of Spain, at his behest Spread their proud fleeces o'er our verdant glade, And Scotia's herds, as on their native shore Our never-failing streams, and pastures rich explore. Intent was he to adorn his own domain With all the radiant charms that Flora brings, There still, the green-house flowers pronounce his name, The favor'd rose its grateful fragrance flings, And in their faithful ranks to guard the scene Like changeless memories rise, the unfading evergreen. On friendly deeds intent, while on his way A widow'd heart to cheer,âOne grasp'd his hand Whose icy touch the beating heart can stay, And in a moment at that stern command Unwarn'd, yet not unready, he doth show The great transition made, that waits on all below. Yet, ah! the contrast,âwhen the form that pass'd Forth from its gates, in full vitality, Is homeward, as a lifeless burden borne, No more to breathe kind word, or fond reply, Each nameless care assume with earnest skill, Nor the unspoken wish of those he loved fulfill. But hallow'd lips within the sacred dome Where he so long his sabbath-worship paid Have given his soul to God from whence it came And laid his head beneath the cypress shade, While âbe ye also ready,â from his tomb, In a Redeemer's voice, doth neutralize the gloom.</field>
