      <field name="fulltext">THE DESTROYER With care, and skill, and cunning art She parried Time's malicious dart, And kept the years at bay, Till passion entered in her heart And aged her in a day! MOON AND SEA You are the moon, dear love, and I the sea: The tide of hope swells high within my breast, And hides the rough dark rockes of life's unrest When your fond eyes smile near in perigee. But when that loving face is turned from me, Low falls the tide, and the grim rocks appear, And earth's dim coast-line seems a thing to fear. You are the moon, dear one, and I the sea. A LOVER'S QUARREL We two were lovers, the Sea and I; We plighted our troth 'neath a summer sky. And all through the riotous, ardent weather We dreamed, and loved, and rejoiced together. At times my lover would rage and storm. I said: âNo matter, his heart is warm.â Whatever his humour, I loved his ways, And so we lived through the golden days. I know not the manner it came about, But in the autumn we two fell out. Yet this I knowâ'twas the fault of the Sea, And was not my fault, that he changed to me. I lingered as long as a woman may To find what her lover will do or say. But he met my smiles with a sullen frown, And so I turned to the wooing Town. Oh, bold was this suitor, and blithe as bold! His look was as bright as the Sea's was cold. As the Sea was sullen, the Town was gay; He made me forget for a winter day. For a winter day and a winter night He laughed my sorrow away from sight. And yet, in spite of his mirth and cheer, I knew full well he was insincere. And when the young buds burst on the tree, The old love woke in my heart for the Sea. Pride was forgottenâI knew, I knew, That the soul of the Sea, like my own, was true. I heard him calling, and lo! I came, To find him waiting, for ever the same. And when he saw me, with murmurs sweet He ran to meet me, and fell at my feet. And so again 'neath a summer sky We have plighted our troth, the Sea and I. REPLY TO RUDYARD KIPLING'S POEM âHe travels the fastest who travels alone.â Who travels alone with his eye on the heights, Though he laughs in the daytime, oft weeps through the nights; For courage goes down with the set of the sun, When the toil of the journey is all borne by one. He speeds but to grief, though full gaily he ride, Who travels alone without Love at his side. Who travels alone, without lover or friend, But hurries from nothing, to nought at the end; Though great be his winnings, and high be his goal, He is bankrupt in wisdom, and beggared in soul. Life's one gift of value to him is denied Who travels alone without Love at his side. It is easy enough in this world to make haste If we live for that purpose; but think of the waste! For life is a poem to leisurely read, And the joy of a journey lies not in its speed. Oh! vain his achievement, and petty his pride, Who travels alone without Love at his side. SONNET Methinks ofttimes my heart is like some bee That goes forth through the summer day and sings, And gathers honey from all growing things In garden plot, or on the clover lea. When the long afternoon grows late, and she Would seek her hive, she cannot lift her wings, So heavily the too sweet burden clings, From which she would not, and yet would, fly free. So with my full fond heart; for when it tries To lift itself to peace-crowned heights, above The common way where countless feet have trod. Lo! then, this burden of dear human ties, This growing weight of precious earthly love, Binds down the spirit that would soar to God. LET ME LEAN HARD Let me lean hard upon the Eternal Breast; In all earth's devious ways, I sought for rest And found it not. I will be strong, said I, And lean upon myself. I will not cry And importune all heaven with my complaint, But not my strength fails, and I fall, I faint: Let me lean hard. Let me lean hard upon the unfailing Arm. I said I will walk on, I fear no harm, The spark divine within my soul will show The upward pathway where my feet should go, But now the heights to which I msot aspire Are lost in clouds. I stumble and I tire; Let me lean hard. Let me lean harder yet. That swerveless force Which speeds the solar systems on their course Can take, unfelt, the burden of my woe, Which bears me to the dust and hurts me so; I thought my strength enough for any fate, But lo! I sink beneath my sorrow's weight: Let me lean hard. POVERTY AND WEALTH The stork flew over a town one day, And back of each wing an infant lay; One to a rich man's home he brought, And one he left at a labourer's cot. The rich man said, âMy son shall be A lordly ruler o'er land and sea.â The labourer sighed, â'Tis the good God's will That I have another mouth to fill.â The rich man's son grew strong and fair, And proud with the pride of a millionaire: His motto in life was, âLive while you may,â And he crowded years in a single day. He bought position and name and place, And he bought him a wife with a handsome face. He journeyed over the whole wide world, But discontent in his heart lay curled Like a serpent hidden in leaves and moss, And life seemed hollow and gold was dross. He scoffed at woman, and doubted God, And died like a beast and went back to the sod. The son of the labourer tilled the soil, And thanked God daily for health and toil. He wedded for love in his youthful prime, And two lives chorded in tune and time. His wants were simple, and simple his creed, To trust God fully: it served his need, And lightened his labour,a nd helped him to die With a smile on his lips and a hope in his eye. When all is over and all is done, Now which of these men was the richer one? DEATH OF LABOUR Methought a great wind swept across the earth, And all the toilers perished. Then I saw Pale terror blanch the rosy face of mirth, And careless eyes grow full of fear and awe. The sounds of pleasure ceased; the laughing song On folly's lip changed to an angry cures: A nameless horror seized the idle throng, And death and ruin filled the universe. PROGRESS In its giving and its getting, In its smiling and its fretting, In its peaceful years of toiling And its awful days of war, Ever on the world is moving, And all human life is proving It is reaching toward the purpose That the great God meant it for. Through its laughing and its weeping, Through its losing and its keeping, Through its follies and its labours, Weaving in and out of sight To the end from the beginning, Through all virtue and all sinning, Reeled from God's great spool of Progress, Runs the golden thread of Right. All the darkness and the errors, All the sorrows and the terrors, Time has painted in the background On the canvas of the World. All the beauty of life's story He will do in tones of glory When these final blots of shadow From his brushes have been hurled. OVER THE MAY HILL All through the night time, and all through the day time, Dreading the morning and dreading the night, Nearer and nearer we drift to the May time Season of beauty and season of blight, Leaves on the linden, and sun on the meadow, Green in the garden, and bloom everywhere, Gloom in my heart, and a terrible shadow, Walks by me, sits by me, stands by my chair. Oh, but the birds by the brooklet are cheery, Oh, but the woods show such delicate greens, Strange how you droop and how soon you are wearyâ Too well I know what that weariness means. But how could I know in the crisp winter weather (Though sometimes I notices a catch in your breath), Riding and singing and dancing together, How could I know you were racing with death? How could I know when we danced until morning, And you were the gayest of all the gay crowdâ With only that shortness of breath for a warning, How could I know that you danced for a shroud? Whirling and whirling through moonlight and star-light, Rocking as lightly as boats on the wave, Down in your eyes shone a deep lightâa far light, How could I know 'twas the light to your grave? Day by day, day by day, nearing and nearing, Hid under greenness, and beauty and bloom, Cometh the shape and the shadow I'm fearing, âOver the May hillâ is waiting your tomb. The season of mirth and of music is overâ I have danced my last dance, I have sung my last song, Under the violets, under the clover, My heart and my love will be lying ere long. FRIENDSHIP Dear friend, I pray thee, if thou wouldst be proving Thy strong regard for me, Make me no vows. Lip-service is not loving; Let thy faith speak for thee. Swear not to me that nothing can divide usâ So little such oaths mean. But when distrust and envy creep beside us Let them not come between. Say not to me the depths of thy devotion Are deeper than the sea; But watch, lest doubt or some unkind emotion Embitter them for me. Vow not to love me ever and for ever, Words are such idle things; But when we differ in opinions, never Hurt me by little stings. I'm sick of words: they are so lightly spoken, And spoken, are but air. I'd rather feel thy trust in me unbroken Than list thy words so fair. If all the little proofs of trust are heeded, It thou are always kind, No sacrifice, no promise will be needed To satisfy my mind. RIVER AND SEA We stood by the river that swept In its glory and grandeur away; But never a pulse o' me leapt, And you wondered at me that day. We stood by the lake as it lay With its dimpled face turned to the light; Was it strange I had nothing to say To so fair and enchanting a sight? I look on your tresses of goldâ You are fair and a thing to be lovedâ Do you think I am heartless and cold That I look and am wholly unmoved? One answer, dear friend, I will make To the questions your eyes ask of me: âTalk not of the river or lake To those who have looked on the sea.â</field>
