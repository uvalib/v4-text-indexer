Idem. COLUMBIA's GLORY, OR BRITISH PRIDE HUMBLED. ADVERTISEMENT. On the capture of Quebec, in the year 1759, the author of the following Poem composed an Ode, called BRITAIN's GLORY or GALLIC PRIDE HUMBLED, which, in the year 1764, was, among other pieces of poetry, published, in London, in a pamphlet, entitled The PATRIOT-MUSE; many of which, after his return from thence, were distributed among his friends in America. As early as the year 1777, observing, that a considerable part of that Ode was applicable to the actual events of the contest of the United States with Britain, the author conceived the idea of writing a Parody upon it, and, in that view, actually put pen to paper on some of the most striking passages: And being, as he ever was, confident of the eventual success of the American cause, and therefore, not doubting but that many future occurrences would prove analogous, he proposed, if he should be so happy as to see the end of the war, to parodize every part of the Ode, which might be capable of such an accommodation. Soon after the peace the same idea was spontaneously suggested to him by some of his friends, and he accordingly began to realize it; but the fatigues of a return from a more than seven years exile to the place of his former abode soon interrupted, and, after that, perplexing cares and a multiplicity of business, which required almost the constant labour of body or mind,—a long series of fits of painful illness, and some peculiar troubles, which, from philanthropy, he wishes no others of mankind may experience, as he has done, either by denying him leisure or by discomposing his mind, prevented the execution of his design, until some time in the summer, 1784: And indeed a considerable part of the Poem was composed by him on his bed, while the generality of mankind around him were asleep. After all, although only a Parody on some particular passages of the original Ode was at first intended (which would have been too diminutive a matter to be offered to the public, except in a magazine or news-paper) the author, animated by the dignity and interesting nature of his subject, could not confine himself to such narrow bounds; but, as a votary to liberty, gave his genius, such as it was, full scope; and as, in his progress, many new thoughts suggested themselves, the result of the whole proved a Poem of considerable length, of which perhaps seven eighths are intirely original. It was finished more than seven years ago, and not long after offered for publication; but, by reason of embarrassments occasioned by the war, it was not in the author's power to pay for the impression on the spot (which was a condition insisted upon by every printer he applied to) unless he misapplied money, which his circumstances required him to devote to more necessary purposes. He therefore gave up all thoughts of publishing it and threw it into his scrutoire, where it has since lain dormant; but, as many writers are of late stepping forth into the world, the author has at length taken it into his head to make one in the crowd; and, although the occasion of his Poem be not of a late date, yet, as the present is a season of great political changes in the world, in consequence of the American Revolution, and, as the Independence of the United States is by them annually commemorated with great festivity, so that it is never like to prove, as they say, an old story, he hopes the publication of his Poem, even at this time, will not be thought altogether unseasonable. Critics, he flatters himself, will be mild in their censures on a Poem composed under so unfavourable circumstances, and candidly excuse faults, which, though he sees them, he has not leisure to correct. Such as the composition is, he hopes it will furnish some entertainment to all true lovers of LIBERTY, and be kindly received by them, as a well-meant endeavour of a sincere friend to his Country.

N. B. Passages of considerable length, whole lines, or the greatest part of a number of successive lines transplanted into this Poem from the original Ode, are printed in italics, in order to save printing work and paper; and for that reason, to prevent misunderstandings, as few other words as possible (perhaps seldom more than single words) are thus emphatically distinguished: But when the Parody required a considerable change of expression, the sentiment being similar; in order to render it more obvious, the corresponding passage of the Ode is inserted in the margin. While injur'd Britain's indignation glows And, in tremendous flow'rs, Extensive ruin pours On her perfidious foes, &amp;c. While FREEDOM's injur'd sons (to the dire woes Of abject slav'ry or destruction doom'd) Who to assert their rights indignant rose, And threaten'd vengeance to oppose The arduous task assum'd, With pow'rful and malicious foes, A doubtful war to wage, Insulted and oppress'd no more, Triumph at length victorious o'er All their unrighteous claims and all their cruel rage; While o'er the late embroil'd domain Tranquillity resumes her reign, All the dire horrors of the contest cease, And, spite of all her envious foes, Th' united sweets Columbia knows Of Independence, Liberty and PEACE;— While she the sword of justice wields, And fills Canadia's rugged fields With terrible alarms; While proud Quebecca yields, &amp;c. While haughty Britain yields, No more the sword of slaughter wields, Nor longer fills Columbia's fields With terrible alarms; But, after all her swelling boasts, Despairing of her ruin'd cause, Herself rescinds her own oppressive laws, And blushing from our long beleaguer'd coasts Reluctantly withdraws Her disconcerted troops and unavailing arms;— And swarthy savage nations fear Incensed Britain's vengeance near, And wond'ring tremble while they hear The thunder of her arms. And while the nations far and near Wonder with deep astonishment to hear, That by a Rebel child The tyranness omnipotent is foil'd, And all Columbia's kind allies, The patrons of her freedom, see, With equal pleasure and surprize, The injur'd righted and th' oppressed free;— At this grand period, this important date Of a new Empire, in the book of fate, Destin'd to be without example great; Kind Heaven's indulgent smiles, False Britain's baffled wiles And Freedom's conquests all my thoughts employ. Fain would I join the voice of fame, And in triumphant sounds proclaim Columbia's glory, Britain's shame, Boast Heaven's peculiar care, That broke th' infernal snare, And give a rescu'd infant nation joy. Oft has the muse in some soft rural strain, Bewail'd her bleeding country's woes; Oft has she mourn'd her heroes slain, And the too easy triumphs of her haughty foes. The conscious forests heard her tell By savage hands how Braddock fell, And sing sad dirges to his awful ghost; Lament Britannia's slaughter'd sons, &amp;c. TO Britain once devoted was my lyre; Oft did the muse my lab'ring breast inspire Her joys and woes to sing, While she was to Columbia just, Nor strove t' enslave her to th' imperious lust Of a despotic king. Then with a loyal pride, For many an happy year, Beneath a patriot monarch's George II. smile, I could a firm allegiance boast: By filial love as by descent ally'd, And doubtful which I held most dear, Or which engag'd my ardor most, My native region or the parent isle; Ev'n while my passion seem'd for each the same, Ambitious of superior style, I fondly gloried in the British name. Then while my cheerful tongue The British conquests sung, My kindred breast with joy ecstatic glow'd; And when the common foe To Britain gave some heavy blow, My plaintive numbers flow'd In sympathetic strains of undissembled woe. But now those social days are o'er, The muse for Britain sings no more, The British laurel withers on my brow, Columbia only is my country now; To her alone my services belong: My head, my heart, my hands, My pen, my lyre, my tongue, Columbia's int'rest now demands, Engrosses all my cares and claims my ev'ry song. Genius of Britain, (awful name!) &amp;c. Oh LIBERTY! thou dear delightful name Indulge an humble bard's request, Propitious smile and fire his breast With thine enthusiastic flame; Let vast ideas thro' his fancy roll, Let mighty raptures swell his soul, And be his numbers worthy of his theme. Thine influence Britain's awful monarch knows, &amp;c. Thine influence Congress knows, Senate august! thence genuinely flows That dignity of sentiment and zeal, Which marks their counsels for Columbia's weal. Her faithful earthly guardian owns, &amp;c. Her guardian hero feels Thine animating charms, And, while his heart undaunted valour steels, With patriot flames his gen'rous bosom glows: Hence he has long thy glorious champion stood, And fought and labour'd for thy people's good; Sublime in virtue, as renown'd in arms. Rous'd by thy voice Britannia's sons Resolve just vengeance on her foes, &amp;c. Rous'd by thy voice and by the dying groans Of slaughter'd freemen, on th' ensanguin'd plain Of Lexington, Columbia's hardy sons, Tho' rude and unexperienc'd, rose, On their inhuman foes To take just vengeance for their brethren slain. Columbia's utmost bound Soon heard the solemn sound Of thy loud summons; at thy call to arms, Like summer's clust'ring swarms, Thy vot'ries throng'd thy standard from afar; Like Cincinnatus in the days of yore, Heroic peasants left their farms, The merchant his accustom'd store And the forensic orator the bar: All ranks with indignation spurn'd The blandishments of an inglorious peace, Forget the blandishments of peace,— And, kindling at war's dire alarms, Leap from the downy lap of ease, And lead their gallant troops intrepid forth to arms. And kindling at the dire alarms, With martial ardor burn'd, Sprang from the downy lap of ease, And rush'd by myriads to th' advent'rous war. Oh! as thy breath inspir'd the sage, As all thine ardor fir'd the hero's rage, May the bard also thy kind aid engage To his advent'rous lay: Be it as smiling vict'ry gay, Tremendous as Columbia's sword, Like her intrepid heroes bold, Triumphant as her banners play; Majestic as her god like lord, &amp;c. George II. Majestic as that rev'rend train, That sit around her council-board; Like her resistless pow'r, By limits uncontroul'd, &amp;c. Like her enlarg'd domain, Almost by limits uncontroul'd, May it in various thought extensive be, And unconfin'd by fetters, as inspir'd by Thee. Alluding to the Pindaric irregularity of the verse. What tho' a rural swain, Unskilful be my tongue? What tho' exil'd so long, Far from my native plain, The author, being a person very obnoxious to British and Tory vengeance, fled from Long-Island, September 1st, 1776, and resided with his family in Connecticut, during the war. My harp untun'd has on the willows hung? I still can sing, and in no vulgar strain, If thou, great pow'r, propitious deign To patronize the attempt and animate my song. Britannia long indignant mourn'd, &amp;c. Columbia long indignant mourn'd Her disappointed aim, Her oft dishonour'd name, Her gallant troops repuls'd with shame, Her offers slighted and her vengeance scorn'd, Triumphant in their crimes.— The cruel murd'rers of the times, She saw proud Gallia's servile sons advance, &amp;c. Her humble suit repuls'd with shame, Slighted her pleas and her petitions scorn'd. Determin'd in their crimes, Those base oppressors of the times, Proud Britain's servile sons she saw Obsequious cross the waves, And, without principle or law, About her cities insolently stride, To awe her patriots into slaves. Nay she beheld, with wild affright, While, with parental pain, She saw her own free children slain, Unhappy victims to the pride of France, &amp;c. And keen parental pain, In cool delib'rate spite, Her own free children slain, Unhappy victims to a tyrant's pride. Dejected on the ground, And desolate she lay, While heav'n tremendous frown'd, And shed its dismal horrors round, With scarce one smiling ray Of joyful hope to cheer the sullen gloom; Tumultuously distrest With presage dire of heavier woes to come, And frantic with despair, She tore her loose neglected hair, Astonish'd smote her boding breast, And anxious trembled at th' impending doom. “Alas! (at length she cry'd) “How can I but repine? “Unhappy me what miseries betide! “Whose fate so hard? whose prospects dark like mine? “Twice fourscore years have roll'd “Their ample circles round, “Since, on my native isle, “Restrain'd my judgment and my conscience bound “In chains and fetters vile, “Render'd by persecution bold, “And by the hopes of freedom led, “Some kind asylum to explore, “From stepdame Britain's tyranny I fled “To this inhospitable shore, “T' enjoy, in some wild desart here, “The privileges which I held so dear, “The rights of conscience and a faith sincere. “Here, on a coast unknown, “With hideous forests overgrown, “Press'd with an heavy load “Of dire afflictions, destitute of aid, “And far remote from all my friends, I made “My desolate abode. “Here often, to my cost, “I mourn'd the death of children lost “By pinching want, by chilling storms, “By dire disease in various forms, “Or the fell inroads of a savage crew; “But providence Divine “From my keen sorrows granted sweet release, “Gave me glad intervals of peace, “Made me prolific as the vine, “And, by a large increase, “With children fill'd my cottages anew. “And tho' rude savages in arms, “With dire invasions and alarms, “Oft troubled my repose; “My sons, by their industrious toil, “From thickets freed th' incumber'd soil, Isaiah XXXV, 1. “And made the desart blossom as the rose. “Increasing and improving still, “New habitations to explore, “The ports to settle or the ground to till, “My children issued in detachments forth, “From East to West from South to North, “And stretch'd my new domain from shore to shore. “At length, in spite of all my foes, “Along the dreary waste, “Fair cities, towns and villages arose, “Where a religion chaste, “From human mixtures pure, “A peaceful seat obtain'd, “From civil punishments secure, “Subject to God alone, and unconstrain'd “Or by the pride or bigotry of kings. “Then did the forest and the field “Kind nature's various bounties yield, “And commerce freighted with her stores, “From my extensive shores, “O'er the wide ocean spread her canvas wings. “But ah! too soon my stepdame's sons, “A selfish race of idle drones, “Eager, without the toil, “To share the produce of the soil, “And of my labours make a spoil, “Came in great numbers o'er; “Resolv'd with zeal to subjugate “All my affairs, in church and state, “To haughty Britain's arbitrary pow'r. “But not content themselves t'invade “The dear-earn'd rights for which I fled, “Long have they insolently try'd, “With superstitious zeal, “To tempt my sons aside, “Implicitly to kneel, “And, like my former children feel “The dire effects of Prelacy Although the author avows, that he was, from principle, as enemy to, and even a writer against, the formerly projected Episcopate, yet, he now declares, that, as a friend to liberty of conscience, he has no objection whatever to Bishops of any kind (of which there are three or four already in these states) so long as they absurdly have no share in the civil government, but, being under its controul, as well as others, confine themselves to the spiritual duties of their function. and pride. “But, though this priestly project fail'd, “A deeper civil plot prevail'd “Rebellion to inspire; “Rouz'd on me Britain's vengeful ire, “And a rebellious crew “Of my base children from their duty drew, “Debauch'd them from my injur'd cause, “To vile submission to oppressive laws, “Good sense abhors and freedom never knew. “And oh! I greatly fear, “(So num'rous is their score) “They'll soon betray “Those liberties I hold so dear, “And give my boasted freedom o'er, “A miserable prey, “To base designing knaves. “No less I fear my faithful sons, “Unpractis'd in the field, “And overmatch'd by numbers, will not dare “In my defence the sword of war to wield; “But, like a set of tim'rous drones, “Will most ignobly yield “To the suggestions of despair, “And be forever slaves.” Thus mourn'd Columbia; but the pow'r Divine Her plaintive lamentation heard, Dispers'd th' ïncumbent gloom, Revers'd the threaten'd doom, &amp;c. Revers'd the threaten'd doom Her anxious spirit fear'd, And, with a smile benign, When most its vengeance low'r'd, Compassionately pour'd A beam of hope, that pierc'd th' incumbent gloom, And her sad bosom cheer'd. Deliv'rance dawn'd o'er Royal Isle, &amp;c: Deliv'rance from the skies First dawn'd on her benighted eyes, When Lexington's embattled field, In spite of all their swelling boasts, Saw haughty British vet'rans yield To humble rustics who appeal'd From man's unrighteous laws, And left the issue of their cause To the decision of the Lord of Hosts. The appeal was heard in heav'n, And the success of that important fray To greater deeds Columbia's sons allur'd, And to more brilliant vict'ries led the way; Which, tho' by transient glooms obscur'd, Were all as harbingers successive giv'n And gave sure earnest of a brighter day, &amp;c. Of a far brighter day: Now, with uninterrupted blaze, That day of glory flames; Now gracious Heav'n displays Its sweetly smiling face, And shines on Britain with continual beams, &amp;c. Now Heaven at length displays His favourable face, In its whole round of smiles array'd, And with consummate grace, Without a cloud, without a shade, Shines on Columbia with continual beams. So some black dismal night, Without a ray of cheering light, Involves the earth awhile; Like that which Pharaoh's court o'erspread, Substantial to the touch and shed Its dusky horrors o'er the land of Nile; Exodus, X. 21. At length, in radiance drest, The morn salutes our eyes, Beams from the windows of the east, And darts its glories streaming o'er the skies. With ruddy flames bright æther glows, Wide and more wide the gay effulgence flows, And puts the shades to flight; 'Till, hast'ning on his morning way, Like a young bridegroom gay, Psalms, XIX, 5. The sun, exhaustless source of light, Victorious o'er conflicting night, Looks glorious forth and consummates the day. Auspicious day! that glorious shines On Britain's bold designs, That spreads her conquests wide, And makes proud Gallia's humbled pride Feel the just vengeance she so oft defy'd. Auspicious day! that glorious shines Upon Columbia's innocent designs, From all rebellion pure; That spreads her territory wide, Humbles imperious Britain's pride, And makes her the just punishment endure, Which, oft predicted, she has oft defy'd. Important date of noble deeds! When all our rights restor'd By Britain's conqu'ring sword, New-Albion's rescu'd and Canadia bleeds, &amp;c. Important date of noble deeds! At which, her rights restor'd, By Washington's victorious sword, Columbia's rescu'd from a tyrant's chain, And a stern stepdame, in her weeds, An injur'd daughter lost deplores in vain. “Bound ev'ry heart, and ev'ry bosom burn!” A line borrowed from Dr. Young's Night-thoughts. Since with the fairest fame Heav'n condescends t' adorn Her once dishonour'd name, In mercy wipes away her shame, Gives her to smile at her revilers scorn, Bids Britain triumph and proud Gallia mourn, &amp;c. And bids disdainful Britain, in her turn, Her own disgrace and ignominy mourn. What tho' we oft deplor'd Our wisest counsels crost, Saw with regret our labour lost, And the defeated efforts of Columbia's sword? Since now the skies succeed Each well concerted scheme, And her vast conquests far exceed The largest hopes the boldest thought could frame, &amp;c.Since now the skies vouchsafe to speed Her humble unambitious aim, Beyond the limits of her utmost claim, And make her vast dominions far exceed The largest hopes the boldest thought could frame. So once with trembling dread, At last the sons of Israel fled Tumultuous o'er the plain; And while their gentile foes prevail'd, Blush'd at their weakness and bewail'd Their efforts baffled, &amp;c.So when, long since, regardless of their groans, Stern Philip rul'd, like an infernal God, His Belgic subjects with an iron rod, In Majesty severe; Smarting beneath his galling stroke, Batavia's persecuted sons Resolv'd to break his heavy yoke, And strove, but strove in vain, For many an unsuccessful year, Their Liberty to gain; And often, while their foes prevail'd, Saw their own weakness and bewail'd Their efforts baffled and their brethren slain. Dire was the contest, in the glorious cause Their perseverance merits great applause; Yet, such their frequent disappointments were, They sometimes thought the struggle to decline, Give up the point and quit the vast design, In absolute despair: But lo! at length They gain new strength, When, by divine command, And by celestial conduct led, With valiant Joshua at their head, The fav'rite troops victorious spread The triumphs of their arms extensive o'er the land. But they at length Recover'd strength, And by celestial conduct led, With valiant Orange at their head, Made their oppressors flee, Push'd their decisive vict'ries far, Put a glad period to the tedious war, And made their country free. O Washington, thou dear illustrious chief, Thou ornament and blessing to mankind, The soldier's glory and thy country's pride, Columbia's skillful guide Thro' the dire contest, and her sweet relief In all the sorrows of her state forlorn! How has thy character refin'd, Since first thy great career began, Together in one glorious group combin'd All the bright virtues that adorn The Christian, Patriot, Hero or the Man, Devout and humble, affable, sincere, Religion's friend, to vice alone a foe, Kindly susceptive of another's woe, Reluctantly severe, And with the noblest dispositions fraught, Virtue thou hast by thy example taught, Which all the good admire and all the bad revere Nor from a thirst for vain applause, Much less a sordid lust for gold or pow'r, But a disinterested zeal, Exalted souls alone can feel, Hast thou devoted ev'ry hour Of seven successive years, Of active pains and anxious cares To the defence of Freedom's injur'd cause Amidst a num'rous crow'd Of strenuous heroes heav'n had kindly giv'n, To form thy splendid train, Whose virtues fame aloud Triumphantly proclaims, Who have so nobly striv'n, By brave exertions and exalted aims Their country's freedom to maintain, Against a lawless tyrant's lust, And fix the pillars of the rising state,— Sublime thou stoodst and eminently great, The first in merit as in rank the first. Amidst a cluster that salutes our eyes, A constellation of distinguish'd names, But chiefly that of the illustrious Green, Thy fav'rite second in the arduous war, Like a resplendent star Of a superior size, And with unrivall'd glory flames In the Columbian skies ? micat inter omnes Irelium fidus velut inter omnes Luna minores.. Alas! how little meritorious here, Nay despicably mean, The Macedonian hero's deeds, A Cæsar's and an Hannibal's appear, Th' exploits of Marlborough and Eugene Charles the XIIth. And those of the bold Monarch of the Swedes! All with diminish'd lustre shine, And ev'n Fred'rick's The late King of Prussia. when compar'd to thine. What tho' those Chieftains, who so greatly sped In ancient or in modern times, More brilliant vict'ries gain'd? By av'rice or ambition led, T'enslave their country As Julius Cæsar did. or distress mankind, They oft from virtue's sacred ways declin'd, Disgrac'd their conquests by their crimes, And all their laurels stain'd: Not such thy objects, motives such as these, On thy pure bosom influence never gain'd; But, fir'd by zeal the good man only knows, Thou hast the int'rests of mankind maintain'd. With an unblemish'd virtue, unarraign'd Or by thy own or by thy country's foes. As like a Cyrus, from his throne Th' illustrious Louis spoke, And issuing his august decree, To all the nations made his pleasure known, In the most lib'ral strains, That from an heavier than Egyptian yoke, And worse than Babylonian chains, Columbia should be free; So like Zerubbabel, in ancient days, Of Israel's captive tribes the illustrious head, Too long oppress'd, thro' many a dubious maze Thou hast her sons to peace and freedom led, And on its basis firmly fix'd the frame Of a vast empire, lasting as thy fame: Or rather, the great Joshua of the age, Thou hast, by thy victorious sword, With prudent valour brav'd A cruel tyrant's rage; Columbia's British inmates quell'd, With all her children that rebell'd, And, to her native rights restor'd, Added a privilege she never crav'd, And giv'n her cause to sing A right exclusive to a spacious land, By the oppressive hand Of a new Pharaoh an hard hearted king, Long doom'd to be enslav'd. Anxious Columbia to subdue To his detested reign, Chagrin'd with disappointments past, Yet resolute his point to gain, He in his counsels wildly rang'd, Oft form'd his plans anew, And, discontented with the last, Almost as oft his chief commanders chang'd. Not so Columbia;—by the public voice, Her first, her last, her only choice, (Ev'n with the dread alternative in view That destin'd her to be, Bound in vile chains, or gloriously free) Too well thy great abilities she knew, For the important charge of her defence, At any time the weighty trust to rue; But with unshaken confidence, Thro' ev'ry varying scene, Adverse or prosp'rous, gloomy or serene, Approv'd thy conduct and rely'd on THEE. While Clinton, Carleton, Howe, With Robinson and Gage, The servile tools of tyranny, employ'd T'enforce the claims of disappointed rage, Each in his turn, with elevated brow, Has trod the military stage, An infamous pre-eminence enjoy'd, And earn'd of shame his individual share; Still at the head of the Columbian line, Contending in a righteous cause, The undivided glory has been thine, With the whole world's applause, Antagonists successive to oppose, The single Chieftain, and conduct the war, Thro' its whole progress to its brilliant close. And now, thy race of glory run, Grac'd with the laurels thou hast won In the illustrious strife, (Like Cincinnatus to his plow) With what majestic dignity hast THOU, By all applauded as by all admir'd, From the tumultuous public stage retir'd To the calm mansions of a rural life; (A life thy placid genius chose). In peaceful fields and quiet farms, No more molested by the din of arms, T'enjoy, as heretofore, Pleasures which solitude alone bestows, The sweets of philosophic lore, And elegant repose. But, tho' no more, in martial pomp array'd, Thy courser bears thee o'er th' embattled field, To fire thy legions to heroic deeds, From public life's parade And brilliant scenes withdrawn, Thou tread'st, perhaps alone, the spacious meads, Or traversest the solitary lawn, Or sit'st retir'd, from ev'ry eye conceal'd, In some sequestred shade; The silver trump of fame, In loud triumphant sounds, Shall thy exploits proclaim To earth's remotest bounds. Whenever commerce, to far distant climes, Unvisited in former times, O'er the broad ocean shall direct her way, Of wealth new sources to explore, And to the breeze Columbia's stripes display, In unfrequented seas And ports unknown before, Th' auspicious gales, That swell her sails, Shall waft thy praises o'er, And thy great actions, O illustrious man! By Heav'n and liberty inspir'd, Shall be recounted and admir'd, Through Persia, India, China and Japan, E'en where fierce Hyperborean storms, Impetuous raging in tremendous forms, Lash the Norwegian or Lapponian coast, In the bleak regions of the frigid zone, And where old ocean roars On Nova-Zembla's frozen shores, Thy worth, thy native country's boast, Shall to the rude inhabitants be shown; Siberia's wand'ring bands shall hear The deeds heroic thou hast done, Thy virtuous character revere, And propagate thy fame: And, while they hail with loud acclaim, The wond'rous chief unknown, Kamschatka Tartars learn to lisp thy name. On this conspicuous stage, The gaze and wonder of the age, Where thou hast acted so sublime a part, Thy character so dear, To ev'ry virtuous heart, As is thy name familiar to the ear, No panegyric needs; Yet the Columbian's thy compatriots here, The witnesses of thy illustrious deeds, Who feel their int'rest in the glorious cause, To such an happy issue brought, By Heav'n's auspicious smiles On thy paternal cares, Who reinstated in their shares, Assign'd by nature's laws, For which thou hast so bravely fought, Now find themselves establish'd heirs, And reap the fruits of thy unwearied toils, Far best thy merits know, and loudest shout applause. By high and low, and old and young, Of all Columbia's virtuous swains, On her extensive happy plains, Are thy due praises sung, In elevated strains, The joy of ev'ry heart and theme of ev'ry tongue; And while the tributary choirs Chant forth, as their esteem inspires, The praise that to thy character belongs, And celebrate what all the world admires, In their melodious songs; Conscious of the vast debt they owe, For all thy gen'rous actions done, And all the blessings thou for them hast won, With sweet delight their fondest passions move, And their enraptur'd bosoms glow, With gratitude ineffable and love. Unable, as they are, T'afford a recompence condign, For all thy faithful diligence and care, From ev'ry pious breast, With the dear load of benefits opprest, Frequent petitions rise, With ardor not to be exprest, T'intreat the power Divine To aid their penury, and shed, In rich abundance from the skies, His choicest stores of blessings on thy head. Nor to the narrow bounds Of one short age alone Shall poorly be confin'd The gen'rous things which thou hast done, To benefit mankind; For, as thy fame resounds To foreign climes; So future times The sweet rehearsal shall regale; Those glorious deeds of thine Tradition shall reveal, And from their father's lips, in a long line, Shall children's children hear the pleasing tale, Meanwhile th' historic page, In which Columbia's sons record Her grievous suff'rings and her glad relief, Shall make thee known to each succeeding age, As the illustrious heav'n commission'd chief, That wrought her rescue from the brutal rage Of Britain's haughty lord: Thy works of love those registers shall show, And oft thy sentiments Alluding to Gen. WASHINGTON's beautiful Letters, written on many occasions, during the war. exalted flow Thro' many a charming line; While, like thy virtues eminent, thy name Shall, with distinguish'd lustre shine In those bright records of Columbia's fame. Posterity shall read The fair detail of each illustrious deed, Crest for their ancestors perform'd by thee, And while their hearts, inspir'd with awe, Revere a man they never saw, Love to thy mem'ry in their breasts shall glow, With grateful ardor, when his name they see, To whose sublime beneficence they owe The bliss of being free. Thrice worthy Washington, how great Thy character, thy conduct and thy State! Long ere Columbia's woes, Or thy command began, So high thy genious and thy virtues rose Above the common line, 'Twere almost reason to suppose Those must be more than man, And, tho' compos'd of common dust, The all-creating power at first Lodg'd some good angel in that form of thine. And since thou didst engage Invading force t'oppose, And with Columbia's foes An arduous war to wage; Such honour, such disinterested zeal, Such diligence, fidelity so rare, Such strict attention to thy country's weal, Such patience, prudence fortitude and care, Have mark'd thy footsteps on the public stage, Which thou with so much dignity hast trod, That, by the conduct of thy past, So worthily sustain'd, Thou hast the whole world's plaudit gain'd, Columbia's love, more ardent and unfeign'd, For her deliv'rance from a tyrant's rod, Than ever state to benefactor bore,— Th' approving voice of thy own conscious heart, And, what is infinitely more, No doubt, th' all gracious euge of thy God. Long live great Washington, to see The fruits of all thy toils, In thy Columbia's conscious smiles, And, to thy great content, may She, In spite of foreign or domestic wiles, Ever remain, what thou hast made her, FREE; Long may'st thou live t'enjoy Columbia's love, And never may her sons ungrateful prove; May thy just merits ever be discern'd; Long live, great man, renown'd, With all that blaze of glory crown'd Thou hast so dearly earn'd. Long mayst thou live thy country to adorn, Instruct her children by thy prudent lore, And point the way, In which they may In season lay, A greater fund of happiness in store For millions yet unborn. Long mayst thou live, but not the sword to wield; O mayst thou often still, In council, with thy wonted skill, Thy needful service to Columbia yield; May she in thy advice rejoice, And oft in Congress hear thy voice, As, at the time this Poem was composed, the American Constitution was not in being, the author acknowledges he did not foresee, what he might have reasonably expected, that, instead of being merely a member of Congress, as he once was, the great WASHINGTON would one day be at the head of the United States. But never, never need thee in the field. Enough of marches and campaigns, Of sieges and embattled plains, Thy worldly warfare now, we trust, is o'er, And thou in carnal arms Shall take the field no more; But the great christian warfare still remains: This must endure thro' life, But 'tis a glorious strife, And vict'ry well shall recompence thy pains. 'Twas thine ere while t'oppose The British tyrants hosts, And num'rous bands of rebel foes, Who made dire inroads on Columbia's coasts, With energy to quell; It yet remains t'engage With rebel angels, and repel Th' assaults of satan and the pow'rs of hell. It was thy happy lot The servants to subdue, And from the sight return triumphing home; O, when thou shall have fought, As a true christian hero ought, Through thy great leader mayst thou overcome, And prove victorious o'er the MASTER Satan. too. And when the conflict shall be o'er, And thou shall have to strive no more, Mayst thou triumphant mount the skies, Whither, victorious o'er his enemies, The heroe-God ascended long before. There, with obeisance meet, At his exalted feet, Low lay thy earthly laurels down, Behold his kind approving smiles, Obtain sweet rest from all thy toils, Put off thy armour, and receive thy crown: A crown of glory in a world serene, Where no fell tyrant tramples on the laws, Unlimited dominion to acquire, Just rights annuls, or with malignant spleen, His injur'd subjects to submission awes With plunder, sword and fire. Where glorious reigns a potentate Divine, To whom archangels bend the obsequious knee; Sov'reign, yet JUST, tho' absolute, BENIGN, At whose supreme decree His happy subjects ne'er repine, Because completely FREE. Bourbon! thy restless soul, &amp;c. O George, thy restless soul, Impatient of controul, Has long aspir'd to universal sway; Thou wouldst extend thine arbitrary rod, Bid kingdoms tremble at thy nod, Reign the sole sov'reign like a god, And make a world obey. Deaf to the sacred laws of right, And usurpation thy delight, Long hast thou aim'd, with ceaseless pains, To gripe New-Albian, &amp;c. To gripe Columbia in thy chains; But the great sov'reign of the sky Saw thy bold aim with jealous eye: Firm to his own eternal laws, And merciful as just, He pitied Britannia's injur'd cause, &amp;c. He pitied her much injur'd cause, Indignant broke Thine iron yoke, Dispers'd thy hopes like transient smoke, And cast thy pride confounded to the dust, What though thine arms could foil Britannia's troops awhile. And triumph in her woe? &amp;c. What though thy fleets could ride Triumphant o'er the tide, In arrogant parade, Insult Columbia's miseries, Block up her ports, distress her trade, And intercept her requisite supplies? Invention, the ingenious artists guide, Necessity's sagacious daughter, vy'd With industry, the friend of the distrest, And both the most important things supply'd, While frugal habits needless made the rest. And while, for common wants of life, The rocks, the mines, the forests, and the farms Needful provision made, For the unequal strife, On each succeeding day, Earth gave the woman in the desart aid, Rev. XII. 16. Against invading harms, In a peculiar way, By yielding, from her pregnant pores, Large magazines of nitrous stores, To furnish fuel for Columbia's arms. What tho' thy armies, train'd In military lore, And by thy pow'rful fleets sustain'd Successively possession gain'd Of all her sea-girt cities on the shore? Though well equipp'd and bold, And well instructed too, As num'rous as they were, All thy battalions were too few, With all their diligence and care, Unless they could be ev'ry where, The whole at once to hold; Or had it been that thy divided host Sufficient energy could boast, Of all at once possession to maintain, The whole of thy usurp'd domain Had comprehended, after all, at most, But here and there a speck on an extensive coast Besides the interjacent grounds, Vast inland tracts had still remain'd, From the incursions of thy armies free; Tracts from thy scanty bounds And posts marine too far, To be by conquest gain'd, Or by that conquest so secur'd to thee, As long to give the owners law; Tracts, which thy soldiers never saw, Or, but as prisoners of war, Were ever born to see. What though thy noble chief, Right honourable THIEF! Issuing from Carlolonia's gates, Inland could propagate th'alarms, And penetrate so far, By dint of numbers and superior arms, As through the bosom of the southern states To drive the unequal war? For no long time he stay'd On such forbidden ground; But, prudently afraid, Remov'd his station near the shore, And, waking from his reverie at last, To his confusion found, When his heroic dream was o'er, That, in his wild vagaries past, He had too far proceeded and too fast. Coop'd up at length in York-Town, like a knave, By Washington, De Grasse and Rochambeau, When he through hopes of succour brave, Had for a while their arms defy'd, Was fain at last, forth issuing from his cave, Himself and army to resign, His conduct indiscreet deplore, And, to his great confusion, undergo, In spite of all his pride, The same humiliating fate Burgoyne, Himself too soon had, censur'd, underwent before. What though tremend'ous issuing forth, That blust'ring hero of the north, With his high sounding titles arm'd, And with his own loud swelling strains, Fantastically charm'd, Found means to work his way Through woods and swamps, with wond'rous pains, Majestically slow, Marshal his troops in terrible array, And make a mighty show On Saratoga's plains? Soon his magnificent parade Prov'd but a tinsel-glare; And all the swelling boasts he made Like bubbles broke and vanish'd into air: For, after two vain efforts in the field, He was ignobly forc'd to yield, With all his titles as he was adorn'd, Confess his weakness and a truce implore, Ev'n of that very people he before Had proudly threaten'd, vilifi'd and scorn'd. But it perhaps may yield Some consolation to his pride, That when he stoop'd so low, And to insulted rustics kneel'd, (The character of the victorious foe, And his own previous gasoonade aside) He suffer'd in reality no more, Than what at Closter-seven Where William, the late Duke of Cumberland, was cooped up by the French, and obliged to surrender his whole army at discretion, in the year 1757. heretofore, Thy humbled uncle's ROYAL HIGHNESS bore. What though sometimes thy veterans could foil Columbia's unexperienc'd bands, Compell them to recoil, Desert the fortress and the field, And, overpower'd by numbers, yield, Their houses and their lands, To thy rapacious myrmidons a spoil? On such occasions their presumptuous pride Expos'd them oft to unexpected woe; And, while they on their boasted strength rely'd, Their hasty triumphs and untimely joy A prelude prov'd to some disastrous blow: For Heav'n by them defy'd, (Who oft infatuates whom he would destroy Quos Deus vult perdere, prius demeutatat.) In vengeance Heav'n suffer'd thee to speed, Thy vanity to feed. And aggravate thy final overthrow. suffer'd them to speed, Their vanity to feed, Into some snare their folly to decoy, And aggravate their final overthrow. Of sentiment and principle devoid, What though thy agents, in a cause so vile, To execute thy purposes, employ'd The basest schemes of violence and guile? What though Columbia oft has seen Wide desolation spread, Along her far extended coasts, By their ill-natur'd spleen; Her towns in ruins laid To furnish matter for illiberal boasts; The living to chagrin, Trampled and spurn'd the ashes of the dead; 'Tis remarkable, that at Huntington on Long-Island, a certain Col. Thompson, wantonly projected the building of a fortification, needless as it was, on the burying ground, and that, in the execution of his plan the bones of a number of the dead were dug up. And, or by fire consum'd, Or to the vilest uses doom'd, The sacred temples of the Lord of Hosts. What tho' she oft with virtuous pain, And all a mother's anguish saw, But saw alas! in vain, (Dire outrages on natures law!) Her daughters ravish'd, and her gallant sons. Ev'n in the instant of surrender, fall By the vile hands of miscreants profane, With sword or bayonet or ball In this manner were a number of American officers as well as privates, and among the rest, Col. Ledyard, Commandant of Fort Griswold, at Groton, a near relation of the author, was most savagely butchered by an officer, of the name of Beckwith, at the moment he delivered his sword in token of surrender. Deliberately slain; Or into cruel bondage led,— Chid in imperious tones, Revil'd, insulted, chain'd,— Close crouded in some dreary cell, With stale unwholesome food And nauseous water fed,— Scourg'd, threaten'd and constrain'd Against their country to rebel, And shed congenial blood, Or, by severe decrees, Condemn'd, in num'rous shoals, By famine, hardship or disease, To perish wretchedly, by slow degrees, In prison-ships and goals? What though, by thy intriguing knaves, The Indian savages and Negro slaves Were tempted to conspire With a rebellious crew Of base deserters from Columbia's cause, Servile abettors of thy wicked laws, Who would have giv'n thee more than was thy due? Who, by attrocious crimes, The scandal of the times, Have well deserv'd the gibbit for their hire; Who coasting the defenceless shores, On their own native ground, And at their parent's doors, Have scatter'd desolation round By plunder, sword and fire. Expedients so malign, By hell suggested and approv'd by thee, With savage joy, not, in the least degree, Promoted, but obstructed thy design. Hadst thou, by common prudence led, And by sublime examples taught, The war conducted in a manly way, And treated captives as a victor ought; Thy cause no doubt had greatly better sped, And thou hadst added to thy score Of abject slaves, vast numbers more Of weak, short-sighted, timid souls, Who, won by spacious artifice t'obey, Had to thy standard fled, Thy pardon to implore, In humble, fawning, cringing shoals, And truckled to thy sway: But such dire scenes of cruelty display'd, Far from intimidating gen'rous minds, (Unlike the locks of the Gorgonian maid, Which petrify'd the wretches they dismay'd) Turn'd ev'ry honest heart to STEEL, And made each real patriot's zeal With double ardor flame; Nay caus'd ev'n TORIES, of more mod'rate kinds, While they aghast survey'd These horrid proofs of thy infernal spite, With terror shudd'ring at the hideous fight, T'abhor thy cause and execrate thy name. And when thy cruel measures fail'd T'effect thy purpose, what avail'd Thy foolish efforts in a milder style, Insidiously design'd Of public spirit, innocence, And the chief means of her defence Columbia to beguile, As satan did the mother of mankind? What real benefit accru'd From specious proclamations, acts of grace, And pompous promises so oft renew'd, With all the pride and folly of grimace? Or what from thy conciliatory laws, Poor embryo-things, begot by crime, And by absurdity conceiv'd, Births immature before their time, Brought forth to light, and by the world believ'd, Brats well befitting thy abortive cause? What from thy sly essays Columbia's polity to undermine, The covenanted union to disjoin, And, in low disingenuous ways, The man of real honor hates, Debauch the plighted faith of individual slates? What from the cunning and intrigue Of thy pacific overtures To the grand council of the gen'ral league? What from thy fascinating lures, Of many various kinds, Industriously display'd, T'entice degen'rate minds To a pernicious and unlawful trade? To ask no more, what pow'r hast thou obtain'd, And what emolument eventual gain'd, By thy whole system of disguise, Thy plots, thy bribes, thy forgeries, Thy OWN, thy people's, and thy PRINTER'S lies? 'Tis true, like their first mother Eve, More covetous than wise, Too many of Columbia's sons, allur'd By some bewitching bait, By thee presented to deceive, Against her dictates did rebell, Hold secret commerce with her enemies, Or e'en her interests abjur'd, And thus from their primeval slate Did miserably fall, as from the skies Th' apostate angels fell; Yet, uncorrupted and sincere, Still did vast numbers persevere, As well with prudence to beware The fatal influence of thy wiles, As gallantly to dare The utmost efforts of thy hostile rage: As these did, in Columbia's cause, With zeal and vigilance engage; She, by heav'n's blessing on their strenuous toils, Their jealous caution and incessant care, Is rescu'd from the Dragon's rav'nous jaws, And as a bird escap'd the fowler's snare. War—war of any kind, But chiefly civil war—however wag'd, Though, by a conduct ne'er so much refin'd, It's mis'ries be assuag'd, Strikes too much terror to the social mind, And on the human race Reflects too much disgrace, To need, its horrors to increase, Such cruel, shameful practices as these. Thou doubtless didst expect great matters thence, Yet never couldst thy fav'rite purpose gain; And, spite of all thy confidence, Hast long been at a vast expence Of honour and humanity in vain, Then make a solemn pause— By all these violations of the laws Of truth and nature in thy wicked cause, Say, George, what hast thou done?— Thou hast display'd a character in view, As to the eye of the meridian sun, Equall'd in gross deformity by few, And over-match'd by none; A character which tell-tale fame Has close connected with thy name, To propagate thro' the whole world thy shame; A character replete with crimes, Which, in succeeding times, With infamy indelible shall stain The foul disgustful annals of thy reign. O George, thou MONSTER! how transform'd thou art! Thou didst at first act so sublime a part,— In thee there seem'd such saintly signs of grace, Such mildness, such integrity of heart, Humility and goodness, that thy face Shone like a SERAPH'S when thy reign began; But, if a seraph, from thy furrow'd brow, Deep mark'd with guilt, thou canst not disavow, 'Tis plain thou art a fallen angel now: Not in a serpent's, but the shape of man. Abject, asham'd, forlorn, Thy own confusion and Columbia's scorn, Isaiah, XIV. 12. How art thou fallen, proud offspring of the morn! How art thou doubly fall'n! sorely crost. By twofold disappointment, not alone How soil'd the glory of thy crown, Which lately so illustrious shone! &amp;c. Is soil'd thy honour and renown, But, to thy keen regret and grievous cost, Are the most brilliant jewels of thy crown, Which erst with so much lustre shone. The fairest districts of thy empire lost: While drawn thy lawless sword, To subjugate to thy despotic sway, This western world, that owns no TYRANT lord; Mad with resentment, and outrageous grown, Full THIRTEEN pillars thou hast spurn'd away, Which once conspir'd, in beautiful array, On a firm basis to support thy throne. So with ambition fir'd, Once Lucifer aspir'd, Beyond his nature's line, T'usurp the throne divine, And set up tyranny in heav'n: At length, by righteous vengeance driv'n To punishment condign; From his exalted seat he fell, Lost all that pow'r his maker God had giv'n, Confounded sunk to hell, And disappointed, curs'd his vain design, So Rehoboam, in the days of old, His supplicating people spurn'd, And, arrogantly bold, Rude threat'nings to their humble suit return'd, But, while their shoulders he resolv'd to load With heavier taxes, and their backs to goad With all the harsh severities of state; In one unhappy day, Ten tribes revolted from his haughty sway, And left th'infatuated king, Tortur'd by keen reflections sting, To curse his folly and repent too late. I. Kings, XII. 16. II. Chron. X. 16. So Charles, in later times, Though canoniz'd, of memory accurst, And stain'd with many heinous crimes, Though by the incense of sweet praise perform'd, Usurp'd prerogatives unjust, And, instigated by the lust Of arbitrary pow'r, Unworthily presum'd Against the constitution to rebel, And with his suff'ring subjects durst A war unrighteous wage; But, in an evil hour To the dire scaffold doom'd, At length, by heav'n's just vengeance, fell A victim to his injur'd people's rage. The author cannot view Charles I. in the light of a martyr, but in that of a TYRANT, by the just judgment of GOD, permitted to be illegally put to death. So James, his foolish son, By his sad fate no wiser made, Felix, quem faciunt aliena pericula cautum. Pursu'd the path his sire had done, And push'd th'accursed trade Of ROYAL violence still farther on; But, trembling and dismay'd, Was glad at last to fly, With guilty horrors chill'd, When he beheld th' immortal William nigh, And, by his friends betray'd, Compell'd to abdicate the throne He so unworthily had fill'd, And to that great DELIV'RER yield A sceptre he had like a fury sway'd. Ah George, take care—lay thy vain thoughts aside, Abjure thy folly and suppress thy pride; Already hast thou, to thy cost, More than the Hebrew monarch, lost; And, if thou still persist, some fatal day May utter ruin bring: For, when Columbia had renounc'd thy sway, Encourag'd by the bold emprize, Hibernia, resolute and wise, From her gall'd neck indignant broke Much of the burden of thy yoke, And now she rates thee but as half a king. Tyrant, be wise! at length beware; Retreat in season and forbear On schemes tyrannical to plod; Pace back thy steps, nor longer dare, With guilty feet to tread The path thy royal predecessors trod: Let their example, follow'd by their fate, Strike through thy soul the salutary dread, Lest thou, incurring universal hate, Lose thy WHOLE empire and perhaps thy HEAD. Thus, O thou monarch of the skies, Forever let th'ambitious fare, Whose impious hearts profanely dare By guilty arts to rise, &amp;c. Thus, O thou MONARCH of the skies, Forever let ambitious monarchs fare, Whose impious hearts, By guilty arts Of force or fraud, profanely dare From legal pow'r to tyranny to rise: Thus let their own invented snare Entangle all the sons of violence and lies. But O, on George the just, &amp;c.— George II. But O, on Louis, the humane and just, Still show'r thy blessings down, Brighten the glories of his crown, In righteousness confirm his throne, And be his lawless foes all humbled to the dust, Reward his virtues with those conscious joys, Which none but virtuous monarchs feel; Since, though of power unlimited possest, That pow'r he gen'rously employs, To succour the distrest; And his diffusive zeal, And kind concern for human weal, Have prov'd him, since his glorious reign began, Fair freedom's guardian, patron of th'opprest, His people's father and the friend of man. During the late Revolution in France, the KING's character and conflict have not appeared in a light equally amiable. More than six times has thy all-chearing sun, Blessings to all dispensing, run His annual journey round the sky, Since he commenc'd Columbia's kind ally, And, on the most ingenuous terms, His own united with her arms, A common war to wage; Defeat a base invader's aims, Quell an oppressor's frantic rage, And force him to recede from his injurious claims, Already his victorious arms Fright haughty Gallia with alarms: Proud Louis trembles on his throne, &amp;c. Already, by their double scourge, Chastis'd the humbled tyrant George Trembles and totters on his throne: We view the scene with glad surprize. But, Lord, the glory we disown; Far hence, ye guilty boasts, begone! Thine is the work, O GOD, and wondrous in our eyes. And, O thou just and wise, Their founder-God, as well as ours, Pour down, in copious show'rs, Thy blessings from the skies On the confederate Belgic pow'rs, Columbia's next allies, And fellow suff'rers from the brutal rage Of an exasperated king: As at Eustatia, &amp;c. O may their int'rests thy regard engage, Be all their cruel breaches heal'd, And all their rights still guarded by the shield Of thy protecting wing. Long since the fathers were, Almost through miracle by THEE, From grievous thraldom sav'd; O may the sons beware, Nor be again enslav'd; But, through thy watchful care, Let them forever be, In spite of ev'ry snare, Like their illustrious predecessors free. And O may LIBERTY, seraphic queen, O'er the whole earth extend her fostr'ing wings, Diffuse her blessings and the nations screen From the mad rage and violence of kings Alas! how many creatures thou hast made, Poor petty gods of mortal birth, Falsely stil'd sov'reigns here on earth, With arrogant parade And sacrilegious pride, Usurp the rights of heav'n, To dust-form'd man deny'd, And with base cruelty invade The birth-right THOU to all mankind hast giv'n! O THOU, the only rightful sov'reign, God! Cause those encroachers to forsake betimes Their impious and unrighteous crimes, Or of their deeds just vengeance take; Challenge thy own prerogative and break The tyrant's sceptre and th'oppressor's rod. From the hard galling chain Of such a king, who, by his boasts profane And impudent appeals to THEE, Has oft thy attributes blasphem'd, Thou hast already set Columbia free; O by the pow'r of thy almighty hand, From ghastly, slav'ry save the guilty land, Thou hast from bondage secular redeem'd:— Still, O great guardian of our state, Thy glorious work of LIBERTY pursue; And, while thou dost our foreign foes defeat, Our worse intestine foes subdue; Make thy salvation, Lord, complete, And from our sins grant us deliv'rance too. Though slander'd and revil'd, And trait'rous rebels stil'd, To the proud monarch of an earthly throne; Against the faith a subject plights, We ne'er oppos'd his legal rights, But aim'd, THOU know'st, alone From his encroachments to secure our own: Nay from his arbitrary sway We with reluctancy withdrew, And, loth e'en lawless pow'r to disobey, Long gave to Cæsar more than Cæsar's due. But ah! THOU injur'd Sov'reign of the skies, To THEE, alas! to THEE, Without the least disguise Or palliating plea, With conscious shame we own, We have indeed been faithless traitors found And rebels to thy throne, Though to our duty bound By the most sacred and endearing ties, Supremely great and yet supremely good, Thou of our youth hast been the careful guide, And thy indulgence all our wants supply'd; Thy pow'r our infant steps upheld, Thy wisdom taught us, and thy bounty fed, With necessary food; Yet we, a vile degen'rate race, Have most ungratefully rebell'd Against thy government and grace, And from our rightful Lord and gracious Father sled. Isai. I.—2. 3. 4. Kind thy restraints, and easy was thy yoke; Yet we, regardless of thy smile, The bands of our allegiance broke, And basely spurn'd thy equitable sway: Nay, obstinately vile, E'en while thy angry scourge we bore, In bold defiance of thy frown, Still uncorrected by thy stroke, Perversely we refus'd to lay The arms of our rebellion down; But still thy wrath persisted to provoke, And from thy laws revolted more and more, Isai. I. 5. O, while thy hand averts The unavailing blow Of thy chastising rod, And favours undeserv'd imparts, May our cold breasts with grateful ardor glow, And our reluctant stubborn hearts Th'attractive influence feel Of cords of mercy and of bands of love: Hosea. XI. 4. From the rebellious road, We so perversely trod, May thy forbearance efficacious prove To draw us back to thee; Our past backslidings heal, And in thy goodness infinitely free, Be ours as thou hast been our father's God. I. Kings VIII. 57. Turn us to thee, our devious feet restore, Great God, and suffer us no more To wander from thy ways, Sam. V. 21. No more by folly to rebell; But, by thy plastic hand, Form us a people for thy praise, Jer. XXX. 40. And in our happy land Let peace and glory dwell. Psal. XLIII. 21. Psal. LXXXV. 8. 9. By radiance DIVINE Illumin'd, and to rank exalted high Among the nations, let Columbia shine, To the whole world's astonish'd eye, With all that lustre dignify'd, Which from RELIGION, LIBERTY, And social virtue springs; But save, O save her, by thy watchful care, From outside grandeur, from the tinsel glare Of luxury and pride; And let her be For ever free From those delusive and pernicious things, Which oft the human race insnare, Honours extrinsic to the mind, And dignities to blood confin'd,— Titles the vilest character may wear, The pomp of courts and pageantry of kings. O may her CONGRESS still, By thee the GOD of liberty inspir'd Obsequious to thy will, Th'important object of their charge pursue; And may its ev'ry member, fir'd With zeal for THEE and love to man, The sacred influence feel, And with attention due, Join to promote the glorious plan, And keep THY glory and Columbia's weal Forever near his heart, and ever in his view. Of mind intelligent and heart sincere, And in the cause of truth and reason bold, May all her sons that rise To offices of public trust, Thy sacred laws revere; All sordid views despise, And their respective places hold, Uninfluenc'd by the lust Of lawless pow'r or gold: Sagacious may her statesmen be, Her legislators wise, Humane her officers, her judges just, And all her children FREE. Rescu'd herself from a proud tyrants rage, And with an happy independence blest, May she, with tender sympathy, assuage The sorrows of th'opprest, In gratitude to THEE impart The blessings THOU hast giv'n, With lib'ral hand and gen'rous heart, To all her fellow-suff'rers of mankind; And ever, in her hospitable arms, Allur'd by liberty's inviting charms, May injur'd virtue, into exile driv'n, A safe asylum find. Already has she afforded a quiet retreat to many oppressed foreigners, and in future times, unless her example should be pretty generally followed by the inhabitants of Europe and even Asia, vast numbers more will avail themselves of the same inestimable benefit. Indulg'd at length a sweet repose, From her long strife with foreign foes, With festive joy may SHE Reap the rich harvest of her toils, From party-rage, intestine broils, And feuds domestic free. Should e'er contending nations round, With savage fury rush to arms, Each other to destroy, And human nature wound; May beneficial arts her pow'rs employ, The author has observed with pleasure, since this poem was written, with what rapidity the inhabitants of the United States were making improvements in both the liberal and mechanical arts. Nor let the loud alarms Disturb her calm tranquility; Unanxious, or through interest or fear, May she, like distant thunder, hear The formidable sound, From all disquiet free; And, save for virtue a becoming zeal, Or kind solicitude for human weal, May she, without emotion, see, Their flaming bolts of mutual vengeance hurl; Her never let such boist'rous storms betide, But, unambitious, prudent and sincere, In views pacific, may she persevere, And, spite of foreign policy or pride, Down the smooth stream of her existence glide, In perfect harmony with all the world. We are at present unhappily engaged in an Indian war; but it is to be hoped, that it will soon be terminated, either by teaching the savages humanity by our example, or by reducing their country to additional territory by conquest. And O may PEACE, celestial maid, descend, Th' unhappy race of man befriend, Make her glad olive bloom on ev'ry shore, And through each future age Her gentle influence extend: May rival hosts no more engage; May all the nations lay aside their rage, And learn the execrable art of war no more. Haste on the glorious day, When Christ his banner shall display, And draw his conquering sword, The world from slav'ry to redeem; When all earth's kingdoms shall submit, In willing homage at his feet, Vanquish'd by his all powerful word, And yield obedience unreserv'd to him: When monarchs shall contend no more, But all with one consent adore MESSIAH, King supreme and universal LORD. When monarchs shall oppress no more, But his high pow'rs usurp'd restore, And all with one consent adore The only potentate, the king supreme And universal Lord. When HE, whose right it is alone, Shall mount in majesty his throne, And rule the world exclusively his own; In whose auspicious reign, Discord and war and tyranny shall cease, And the free subjects of his wide domain Shall all by glad experience prove His sceptre righteousness, his kingdom peace, And all the laws of his blest empire love.
