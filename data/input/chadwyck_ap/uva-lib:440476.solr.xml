      <field name="fulltext">THALIA Morocco, and the Muse, and mimicry Of what God never made and never meant For manâHimselfâdiaphanously blent With living shadows, play the mastery: Pollio capers with Terpsichore, While ass-eared Midas, swinishly content, Wallows and roots amid the mire anent, Nor peers beyond the spangled scenery. We know not, dying, what we may be, dead; We know not, living, what we are, alive:â While painted Sorrow's mercenary laugh Is linked with living lies, and ever read As truthâthroughout this humming human hive Where is the man to write man's epitaph? PALAEMONâDAMOETASâMENALCAS Menalcas. Whose flock is that, Damoetas? Meliboeus'? Damoetas. No, Argon lately placed them in my care. M. O sheep! forever an unhappy flock! While, fearful of my own supremacy, Argon himself the fair Naera courts, The guard Damoetas drains them twice an hour And robs the lambs and mothers of their milk. D. Less freedom, sir, in dealing words to men; For well we know both who corrupted you And what the goats with sidelong glances saw; And more, we know the cave wherein 'twas doneâ The kindly Dryads laughing all the while. (âAnd the good-natured Nymphs etc.â) M. And doubtless, too, they saw me with my knife To cut the vines and tender shoots of Ulycon. D. Or rather when amidst this ancient wood You broke the arrows and the bow of Daphne's Which you, Menalcas, grieved to see returned And would have died but for the pain you gave him. M. Where are the masters while their raging slaves Dare to address me thus! O wicked one, Did I not see you trap the goat of Damon, Lycisca barking madly all the time? And when I called out, âTityrus, where goes he? Collect your flock!ââyou hid among the sedge. D. And should he not yield up the goat to me, Since with my voice and reed I conquered him? If you would know it, sir, the goat is mine: Damon himself confessed as much to me, Yet says he cannot pay one what is due. M. You won a prize at singing! as if you Could play a waxen reed! Why clown, 'tis yours To blow your murderous note upon the highway. D. Lo! shall we have a contest here between us? I'll take this heifer, and, lest you refuse I'll say she comes to milking twice a day, And feeds two calves besides. Now, my good friend, What pawn will you advance to cover mine? M. I dare not meet thy wager from the flock: My father is at home, and worse than that, A crabbed step-dame: both count twice a day The sheep, and one the kids. But I will pledgeâ Since 'tis your will to carry out this follyâ What you yourself will own far worthier: These beechen cups wrought for Alcimedon On which the ivy, exquisitely carved With facile chisel, sweetly intermingles Its scattered fruit and pallid foliage. Two figures are engravÃ©d in the center: The one is Conon, andâwho was the other?â Who with his rod marks out the world for manâ The time for ploughing and for harvesting? These are kept hidden; lips have never touched them. D. Alcimedon has made for me two bowls And wound the handles round with acanthus; With Orpheus graven in a woodland scene. These two are hidden; lips have never touched them. Yet if you will but look upon my heifer The cups are nothing to deserve your praise. M. Let there be no delay, for I will come Wherever you may call. Or let the one Who now approaches hear usâlookâPalaemon. And I will take good care that in the future Damoetas tortures no man with his voice. D. Begin, if you have anything to sing; You'll find me ready, nor will I dispute The judgment; therefore, my good friend Palaemon, This contest; 'tis no trifling affair. Palaemon Sing, as we sit amid the tufted grass: Now all the field and all the wood is blooming; The trees are green, the year is in its glory, Begin, Damoetas, and Menalcas follow; Alternatelyâthe way the muses love. D. Begin with Jove, O Ulysses! all things are full of Jove: 'Tis he that loves the earth; 'tis he that loves my song. M. Phoebus loves me; for him I ever keep close by His chosen gifts; the laurel and blushing hyacinth. D. Galatea, playful maiden, seeks me with an apple; Then flies, but wishes to be seen before she hides. M. My flame Amyntas comes of his own will to me, And Delia to my dogs is now no better known. D. I'll make my love a gift: for I have found the spot Where the high-soaring pigeons rear their tender young. M. I've sent my love ten apples all ruddy from the woodlandâ As many as I could: I'll send ten more tomorrow. D. How many and how sweet the words of Galatea! Bear them aloft ye winds, so may th'immortals hear them. M. Where is my joy, although you hold me dear, Amyntas, While you pursue the goats for me to tend the toils? D. Bid Phyllis come to me, Iolas; 'tis my birthday. I offer sacrifices ere long; then you may come. M. But I love Phyllis more: she weeps at separation; And cries âFarewell! Farewell! a long farewell!ââIolas. D. Wolves to the flock are fatal; showers to ripened grain; Wind to the trees; to me the wrath of Amaryllis. M. Rain cheers the crops; arbutus is sweet to tender kids; Osier to laden sheep, to me none save Amyntas. D. Great Pollis loves to hear the rustic song I sing; O, mountain Muses, rear a heifer to your lover. M. He writes a wondrous songâOh, feed the bull that now Lifts high his head and spurns the sand beneath his feet. D. Who loves thee, Pollis, may win they cherished fame: For him may honey flow and bramble bear amomum. M. Who hates not Bavius must love thy song, O Maevius! And he would milk a butting goat, or yoke his foxes. D. O boys, who gather flowers and growing fruits of earth, Flee hence!âa long cold snake is lying in the grass. M. My sheep, go not too near! you cannot trust the bank; For even now the rain shakes out his dripping fleece. D. O Tityrus, from the stream call back your feeding flock: Ere long I'll wash them all myself, in yonder spring. M. O boys, collect the sheepâif summer's burning heat, As formerly, destroys the milk we work in vain. D. Alas! how lank and lean my bull stands in the field! The love that kills the herd will kill the keeper too. M. But love is not in mineâtheir bones scarce held together: I cannot tell the eye that charms my tender lambs. D. Oh, tell me in what land, and be my great Apollo, Only three ells of sky lie open to the sight. M. Oh, tell me in what land the written names of kings Are born with blooming flowers and Phyllis shall be thine. Pal. 'Tis not for me to judge so fine a matter; The prize belongs to one as to the other: To any one who sings of love so sweet, Or labors through such sorrow.âNow, my boys, The rivers closeâthe fields have drunk their fill. THE CLAM-DIGGER CAPITOL ISLAND There is a garden in a shallow cove Planted by Neptune centuries ago, Which Ocean covers with a thin, flat flow, Then falling, leaves the sun to gleam above Those oozy lives (which reasoning mortals love) Reposed in slimy silence far below The shell-strewn desert, while their virtues grow, And over them the doughty diggers rove. Then awful in his boots the King appears, With facile fork and basket at his side; Straight for the watery bound the master steers, Where giant holes lie scattered far and wide; And plays the devil with his bubbling dears All through the bounteous, ottoitic tide. ISAAC PITMAN With many a whirling dash of dim design He snares the flying thought in frenzy flung; The captive cadence of the human tongue Follows his hand, immured in every line: His labor through the centuries will shine, And when this old man dwells no more among The living, where his glories long have rung, Calling his fellows to the phonic shrineâ Still will he walk Fame's flowering avenues, Amid rich gardens through his life-work sownâ Fairer than vineyards in far Sicily; And here the Master, mutely musing, views New flowers springing where the old have grown, The princely pageant of posterity. THE GALLEY RACE [AENEID] BOOK V, 104â285 The welcome day arrives; the rising sun Brings the ninth morning in with glorious light And all the neighboring country is aroused By the great name and glory of Acestes. An eager multitude they crowd the shore, Some to behold the Trojans, some prepared To enter for the glories of the day. First, in their midst, the prizes are displayed; The sacred tripods, wreaths of green, and palms; Talents of gold and silver, arms and robes Dyed with rich purple; now the trumpet's peal Proclaims the joyous festival begun. Four galleys chosen from the fleet appear, Oared heavily and equally equipped. The flying Pristis Mnestheus drives along With rapid oarsâMnestheus of Italy Soon afterâwhence have sprung the Memmii; And Gyas with the great Chimera comesâ A huge affair, a city in itselfâ Which Trojans in a triple line impel; Sergestus (whence the Sergian house) commands The mighty Centaur; and Cloanthus (whence Your race Cluentius) the dark blue Scylla. At sea, far distant from the foaming shore, There is a rock, which when the wintry winds Obscure the stars, is thumped and overwashed By tumid floods; but when the waves are still It rises silent from the silent sea, A gracious haunt for sunny comorants [sic]. Here as a goal the great Aeneas fixed A leafy oak, a signal for the seamen That they may know the turning of the course. Then lots are drawn for places, and the masters Glitter in gold and purple from the sterns. The crews are crowned with poplar leaves, and glossed With oil, their naked shoulders turn the sun. They take their seats and grasp with eager arms The oars and anxiously await the sign, While throbbing fears and burning hopes of praise Glow in their ardent bosoms. Then at length, When the clear trumpet sounds, without delay All forge ahead, their clamor fills the air; Torn by their arms the waters froth and foam; Their wakes are equal and their trident beaks Mixed with the oars tear up the foaming flood. No flying chariot sweeps the field like these, No charioteer so pays the loosened rein, Nor hangs himself ahead to swing the lash. Then all the grove resounds with shouts of men And zealous cheers; along the curling shore The voices roll; the quivering hills around Throw back the clamor. Mid wild shoutings then Leaps Gyas headlong, foremost in the fray; Then comes Cloanthus, with more practiced oar, But the huge weight of ship holds back itself; Close after these the Centaur and the Pristis Vie with each other striving for the lead: 'Tis now the Pristis, now the Centaur holds it; Now they are borne together beak to beak, Their long keels furrowing the salt sea waves. Soon they approach the rock and reach the goal, When conquering Gyas to the pilot cries, âWhy to the right!âcome nearerâhug the shore! So we may brush the rocks upon the left Without the oarsâlet others hold away!â He spoke, but blind Menoetes fearing reefs Steered for the open sea. âWhy thus Menortes [sic]! Bear to the rock!â again called Gyas madly. And now behold he sees Cloanthus coming Close in the rear, to take the inner course; Sheer to the left, between the sounding rocks And Gyas' ship, he shoots a sudden course And safely holds the sea beyond the goal. Then fired with deep chagrin while tears of wrath Rolled down his cheek, unmindful of the scene And all regardless of the common safety, He flung the dull Meneotes from the stern Head-foremost to the sea, and took his post; And mid the cheering of the sailors turned The rudder to the rock. Now old Menoetes, At length emerging from the water, climbsâ His heavy garments dripping in the seaâ High on the rock and perches in the sun. The Trojans greet his tumble with a howl And jeer him swimming; and they laugh aloud To mark him heave and spew the swallowed brine. Then to the minds of Mnestheus and Sergestus A brave hope springs that they may overtake The tardy Gyas. Now Sergestus leads A little, and Pristis' forging beak Comes tearing alongside. Then rushing down Among the crew the urging Menesthus cries: âNow! friends of Hector, now! bend to the oars! Ye comrades whom I chose from falling Troy Now show that strength and zeal by which ye passed Graetulian [sic] quicksands and Ionian seas! Not that I hope to win the first rewardâ (Ah, if I could!)âBut let thy will prevail, O Neptune! Shameful 'tis to be lastâ Conquer it, friends! and save us from disgrace.ââ Then all their power is given to the work; The tall ship trembles with the giant strokes; Drawing the sea beneath; with rapid breath And parching throats their limbs are trembling, And gushing sweat rolls over them in rivers. Mere chance it was that gave the cherished glory: Sergestus, furious, now turn'd his prow Too near the rock and struck the jutting reef; The rough crags trembled and the oars were snapped, The broken beak hung pendant from the ledge; The rowers with a might clamour cease And rising seize sharp iron pikes and poles And gather from the sea the broken oars. But Mnestheus, joyful all the more for this, With flying oars makes for the settling waves And shoreward rushes down the spreading sea. Just as a dove, whose home and cherished young Lie in a rocky shade: the cave disturbed And frightened from her nast she seeks the fields With flapping wings, there through the tranquil air She cuts a liquid course in silent flight. So Mnestheus, so the Pristis cleaves the wave Around the goal, borne by the impetus. And now he leaves Sergestus on the rock In shallow seas and vainly calling aid, Striving to free his ship with shattered oars. Soon the Chimera, Gyas' bulky craftâ The pilot goneâher overtakes and passes. Cloanthus leading forges on ahead, His only rival, whom he now pursues With all his powers. Then great shouts arise And all applaud while redoubled cheers Roll through the trembling air. The Scylla's crew, Scorning the thought of losing what is theirs, Would willingly resign their lives for glory. Success inflames the others: they can win For they believe they can. Perchance they might Have borne the prizes with an equal course Had not Cloanthus, stretching out his hands, Sought aid in prayers and called the gods to witness: âYe gods, who rule the sea, whose realms I sweep, Joyfully will I offer unto you Before the altar, on these shores, a bull Snow white; and I will give unto the sea His entrails, and pour out the flowing wine.â He spoke, and from the bottom of the deep His voice was heard alike by all the Nymphs, And Phorcus and the virgin Panopea, While old Portunus pushed with mighty hands. Swift as the wind in arrowy flight she speeds, And rides triumphant in the land-locked port. Then all are summoned while the great Aeneas Declares Cloanthus victor in the race And crowns his temples with a wreath of laurel. Three bullocks are awarded to the ships, And wine, together with a weight of silver. The leaders he rewards with special honors: A golden chlamys to the conqueror, Bordered by waving Meliboean purple; And there inwoven the boy Ganymede Through Ida's grove pursues the weary deer, Breathless yet eager in the pictured scene: Him Jupiter's swift eagle has caught up And borne away from Ida in his claws; In vain the aged guards uplift their palms, While howls of raging dogs wail through the air. To Mnesthus next, who by his valor won The second place, he gives a coat of mail Jointed with hooks and triple wove of gold. The prince had stripped it from Demoleos Where rapid Simois flows by lofty Troy. This he presents. A rich defence in war, With difficulty two attendants bore The ponderous folds away upon their shoulders; Demoleos however, thus arrayed, Pursued the straggling Trojans in their flight. Two brazen caldrons Gyas then receives, With richly figured drinking cups of silver. At length, now all rewarded and rejoicing, They issue forth their temples bound with purple, When, from the fateful rock released, Sergestus Paddled with scanty oars his crippled craft, Scoffed and unhonored. As a snake, o'ertaken Upon the highway, which a wheel has crossed Or traveller with heavy blow has struck And left half-dead and ground beneath a rock, Vainly retreating, curls its tortuous length And hissing rears its head with glittering eyes, Ferocious; though retarded by the wound Twisting and writhing struggles on its way, So the slow ship worked inward to the shore; Now sails are set, and thus with spreading sheets She enters port. Aeneas, gratified To see the ship restored with all its crew, Allows the foiled commander as a prize Pholoe, a Cretan slave with nestling twins. TRIOLET Silent they stand against the wall, The mouldering boots of other days. No more they answer Duty's callâ Silent they stand against the wall,â Over their tops the cold bugs crawl Like distant herds o'er darkened ways. Silent they stand against the wall. The mouldering boots of other days. BALLADE OF A SHIP Down by the flash of the restless water The dim White Ship like a white bird lay; Laughing at life and the world they sought her, And out she swung to the silvering bay. Then off they flew on their roystering way, And the keen moon fired the light foam flying Up from the flood where the faint stars play, And the bones of the brave in the wave are lying. 'Twas a king's fair son with a king's fair daughter, And full three hundred beside, they say,â Revelling on for the lone, cold slaughter So soon to seize them and hide them for aye; But they danced and they drank and their souls grew gay, Nor ever they knew of a ghoul's eye spying Their splendor a flickering phantom to stray Where the bones of the brave in the wave are lying. Through the mist of a drunken dream they brought her (This wild white bird) for the sea-fiend's prey: The pitiless reef in his hard clutch caught her, And hurled her down where the dead men stay. A torturing silence of wan dismayâ Shrieks and curses of mad souls dyingâ Then down they sank to slumber and sway Where the bones of the brave in the wave are lying. ENVOY Prince, do you sleep to the sound alway Of the mournful surge and the sea-birds' crying?â Or does love still shudder and steel still slay, Where the bones of the brave in the wave are lying? IN HARVARD 5 In Harvard 5 the deathless lore That haunts old Avon's classic shore Wakens the long triumphant strain Of Pride and Passion, Mirth and Pain, That fed the Poet's mind of yore. Time's magic glass is turned once more And back the sands of ages pour, While shades of mouldered monarchs reign In Harvard 5. Thin spirits flutter through the door, Quaint phantoms flit across the floor: Now Fancy marks the crimson stain Of Murder. ... and there falls again The fateful gloom of Elsinore. In Harvard 5. MENOETES Who is this fellow floundering in the wave, Flung from the Trojan galley thundering by? Lightly, my friend; he may be you, or I! This passage from the master to the slave Is but a flash; the pinnacle we crave Totters and falls; and life is but to fly The dark immediate anguish surging nighâ To foil the shrewd enclosure of the grave. So, when I read of old Menoetes thrown By raging Gyas to the furrowed brine, I cannot wholly laugh: there is a tone Of merry sadness in the poet's line That tells me summer suns will never shine When skies with tyrannous clouds are overblown. BALLADE OF DEAD MARINERS: ENVOI Days follow days till years and years are fled; Years follow years till hopes and cares are dead, And life's hard billows boom their message home: Love is the strongest where no words are said, And women wait for ships that never come. DOUBTS Yes, this is the end of life, I supposeâ To do what we can for ourselves and others; But men who find tragedy writ in a rose May forget sometimes there are sons and mothersâ Fathers and daughters of love and hate, Scattered like hell-spawn down from Heaven, To teach mankind to struggle and wait Till life be over and death forgiven. FOR A COPY OF POE'S POEMS Like a wild stranger out of wizard-land He dwelt a little with us, and withdrew; Bleak and unblossomed were the wayes he knew, Dark was the glass through which his fine eye scanned Life's hard perplexities; and frail his hand, Groping in utter night for pleasure's clue. These wonder-songs, fantastically few, He left us. ... but we cannot understand. Lone voices calling for a dimmed ideal Mix with the varied music of the years And take their place with sorrows gone before: Some are wide yearnings ringing with a real And royal hopelessness, some are thin tears. Some are ghosts of dreams, and oneâLenore. THE MIRACLE âDear brother, dearest friend, when I am dead, And you shall see no more this face of mine, Let nothing but red roses be the sign Of the white life I lost for him,â she said; âNo, do not curse him,âpity him instead; Forgive him!âforgive me! .. God's anodyne For human hate is pity; and the wine That makes men wise, forgiveness. I have read Love's message in love's murder, and I die.â And so they laid her just where she would lie,â Under red roses. Red they bloomed and fell; But when flushed autumn and the snows went by, And spring came,âlo, from every bud's green shell Burst a white blossom.âCan love reason why? TAVERN SONGS: CHORUS. There's a town down the river Down the river, down the river, There's a town down the river, By the sea. THE ANTIGONE OF SOPHOCLES [1] âYour pleasureâof the friend as of the foeâ Is one with mine, O Creon.â [Lines 211â212 September 29, 1894] [2] Nothing is there more marvelous than man! Driven by southern storms he sails amidst The wild white water of the wintry sea, And through the thunder of engulfing waves; And Earthâunceasing monarch of the godsâ He furrows, and the plows go back and forth, And turn the broken mold year after year. He traps and capturesâall inventive man!â The light birds and the creatures of the wild, And in his nets the fishes of the sea; He trains the tenants of the fields and hills, And brings beneath the neck-encircling yoke The rough-maned horse and the wild mountain bull. [Lines 332â352 October 28, 1894] [3] ââmoney is the most accursed thing That man has ever made; it strikes down cities And scatters families; it leads away Good souls of men to foul accomplishments And teaches them the practice of all guile And all iniquity.â [Lines 296â301 November 48, 1894] [4] Strophe II Unsatisfactory [And language has he learned and wind-swift thought] And speech and soaring wisdom has he learned, With human measures and a way to shun The sharp and painful arrows of the frost. Full of resource, of all the future brings, This is the part that sticks me more than all the rest.Resourceless meets he nothing; Death alone He never shall escape; but he has found [A cure] for life's unyielding maladies. [a cure]. Antistrophe II Thus gifted with a shrewd inventive skill Beyond belief, now makes he for the right, Now for the wrong. And first of all the state Is he who honors most the nation's law And the sworn justice of the gods; but he Becomes an outcast whom rash folly binds In evil fellowship, nor shall he dwell With me, nor think with me, whose action thus... The Ox breaks this lineâyou do not. I like it better broken, but can easily change it. How do the anchorites agree upon it? Perhaps this will go.I marvel at this portent of the gods! Knowing her as I do can I deny The maid Antigone?âO wretched girlâ Child of a wretched father, Ådipus, Tell me!âthey surely cannot lead you here Captured in this wild work against the king! [Lines 354â383 November 4, 1894] GUARD Here is the guilty one that buried himâ We seized her in the work.âBut where is Creon? CHORUS Returning from the palaceâin good time To meet your opportunity. CREON What is this? I come to meet whose opportunity? GUARD O King, 'tis not for any man to say What things he will not do; for second thoughts Belie the first resolve. I could have sworn That I should never come this way again But slowly, for your threats; yet am I here (For joy without our expectation Has none to match it) spite of my past vow, Leading this maiden whom we found at work Over the dead man's grave. No shaken lot Is this, but still my own good fortuneâmine, And only mine.âAnd now, O King, I pray you, Take her and question her, and do with her According to your will. But I am free, And justly clear of this unhappy crime. CREON 'Tis she you bring! and how? Whence do you bring her. GUARD She buried Polynices; you know all There is to know. CREON Is this truth you tell me? GUARD I saw this maiden burying the corpse Against your order. Do I speak straight words? CREON And how was she discovered? and how taken? GUARD 'Twas thus: In terror of your fearful threat, As soon as we were there we swept away The dust that hid the corpse; and having stripped The body, damp with death, we placed ourselves High on a windward hill to shun the stench; And there we waited, busily alert With hard reproach for any man of us Who made a sign to shirk. So the time passed Until the noonday sun stood overhead, Burning with his heatâwhen suddenly There came an awful whirlwind out of heaven That filled the plain and all the mighty air And vexed the woodland with unwholesome dust. This god-sent plague we suffered with closed eyes; And when it ceased, after a weary time, We saw this maiden coming; and she cried With a quick bitter wailing, like a bird Over an empty nest. So grieved she then, When she beheld the body lying bare, And called down imprecations upon those Who wrought the deed; and straightway did she bring Dry dust in her own hands, and from an urn Well shaped of brass and lifted high in air, Thrice did she crown him with poured offerings. When we saw this we rushed at once upon her And seized her, unappalled at our approach; And when we there accused her of this crime And of the first as well, she made no sign, Nor uttered any word in her defense. At once a pleasure and a pain to me Was this: for, though it be a pleasant thing To make one's own way out of jeopardy, Painful it is to send another there. But then all this was naturally less To me than my own safety. CREON (To Antigone) Tell me, you With your head bowed to earth, if you confess Or you deny that you have done this thing. ANTIGONE Yes, I confess. [Mss. note] It would hardly be kindness to Sophocles to reproduce an Attic redundancy in a language that won't stand it. CREON (To Guard) You may go where you will, Acquitted of this heavy charge.â(To Antigone) But you Will tell me, and that briefly, did you know The proclamation that made this forbidden? ANTIGONE I knew it, and why notâ'Twas very plain. CREON And you have dared then to transgress the laws! ANTIGONE Yes, for the word was not of Jove at all; Nor was it Justice, dwelling with the gods Below the earth, that framed your government; Nor did I think this edict you proclaimed So strong that I could break the laws of heaven, Unwritten and unchanging. For, O King, They are not of today, nor yesterday But for all time they are, and no man knows Of their beginning. It was not for fear Of any human will that I would pay The gods my penaltyâfor I must die. Well did I know that ere I ever heard Your proclamation; and if I die now, Before my time, so much I count my gain; For whosoever lives as I have lived, In many sorrows, will by dying reap His best reward. Therefore to meet my fate The pain is nothing; but if I had left The child of my own mother to lie dead Without a mound above himâthat indeed Were sorrow; but there is no sorrow now. And if by chance you still declare What I have done to be a foolish thing Then I am charged with folly by a fool. [Lines 384â470 November 11, 1894] KOSMOS Ah,âshuddering men that falter and shrink so To look on death,âwhat were the days we live, Where life is half a struggle to forgive, But for the love that finds us when we go? Is God a jester? Does he laugh and throw Poor branded wretches here to sweat and strive For some vague end that never shall arrive? And is He not yet weary of the show? Think of it, all ye millions that have planned, And only planned, the largess of hard youth! Think of it, all ye builders on the sand, Whose works are down?âIs love so small, forsooth? Be brave! To-morrow you will understand The doubt, the pain, the triumph, and the Truth! FOR A BOOK BY THOMAS HARDY With searching feet, through dark circuitous ways, I plunged and stumbled; round me, far and near, Quaint hordes of eyeless phantoms did appear, Twisting and turning in a bootless chase,â When, like an exile given by God's grace To feel once more a human atmosphere, I caught the world's first murmur, large and clear, Flung from a singing river's endless race. Then, through a magic twilight from below, I heard its grand sad song as in a dream: Life's wild infinity of mirth and woe It sang me; and, with many a changing gleam, Across the music of its onward flow I saw the cottage lights of Wessex beam. EDWARD ALPHABET Look at Edward Alphabet Going home to pray! Drunk as he can ever get, And on the Sabbath day!â THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT For those that never know the light, The darkness is a sullen thing; And they, the Children of the Night, Seem lost in Fortune's winnowing. But some are strong and some are weak,â And there's the story. House and home Are shut from countless hearts that seek World-refuge that will never come. And if there be no other life, And if there be no other chance To weigh their sorrow and their strife Than in the scales of circumstance, 'T were better, ere the sun go down Upon the first day we embark, In life's imbittered sea to drown, Than sail forever in the dark. But if there be a soul on earth So blinded with its own misuse Of man's revealed, incessant worth, Or worn with anguish, that it views No light but for a mortal eye, No rest but of a mortal sleep, No God but in a prophet's lie, No faith for âhonest doubtâ to keep; If there be nothing, good or bad, But chaos for a soul to trust,â God counts it for a soul gone mad, And if God be God, He is just. And if God be God, He is Love; And though the Dawn be still so dim, It shows us we have played enough With creeds that make a fiend of Him. There is one creed, and only one, That glorifies God's excellence; So cherish, that His will be done, The common creed of common sense. It is the crimson, not the gray, That charms the twilight of all time; It is the promise of the day That makes the starry sky sublime; It is the faith within the fear That holds us to the life we curse;â So let us in ourselves revere The Self which is the Universe! Let us, the Children of the Night, Put off the cloak that hides the scar! Let us be Children of the Light, And tell the ages what we are! âI MAKE NO MEASURE OF THE WORDS THEY SAYâ I make no measure of the words they say Whose tongues would so mellifluously tell With prescient zeal what I shall find in hell When all my roving whims have had their day,â I take no pleasure of the time they stay Who wring my wasted minutes from the well Of cool forgetfulness wherein they dwell Contented there to slumber on alway;â But when some rare old master, with an eye Lit with a living sunset, takes me home To his long-tutored consciousness, there springs Into my soul a warm serenity Of hope that I may know, in years to come, The true magnificence of better things. BOSTON [Following the octave] I know my Boston is a counterfeit,â A frameless imitation, all bereft Of living nearness, noise, and common speech; But I am glad for every glimpse of it,â And there it is, plain as a name that's left In letters by warm hands I cannot reach. FOR SOME POEMS BY MATTHEW ARNOLD Sweeping the chords of Hellas with firm hand, He wakes lost echoes from song's classic shore, And brings their crystal cadence back once more To touch the clouds and sorrows of a land Where God's truth, cramped and fettered with a band Of iron creeds, he cheers with golden lore Of heroes and the men that long before Wrought the romance of ages yet unscanned. Still does a cry through sad Valhalla go For Balder, pierced with Lok's unhappy sprayâ For Balder, all but apared by Frea's charms; And still does art's imperial vista show, On the hushed sands of Oxus, far away, Young Sohrab dying in his father's arms. BALLADE OF DEAD FRIENDS As we the withered ferns By the roadway lying, Time, the jester, spurns All our prayers and pryingâ All our tears and sighing, Sorrow, change, and woeâ All our where-and-whying For friends that come and go. Life awakes and burns, Age and death defying, Till at last it learns All but Love is dying; Love's the trade we're plying, God has willed it so; Shrouds are what we're buying For friends that come and go. Man forever yearns For the thing that's flying. Everywhere he turns, Men to dust are drying,â Dust that wanders, eying (With eyes that hardly glow) New faces, dimly spying For friends that come and go. ENVOY And thus we all are nighing The truth we fear to know: Death will end our crying For friends that come and go. FOR CALDERON And now, my brother, it is time For me to tell the truth to you: To tell the story of a crime As black as Mona's eyes were blue.â Yes, here to-night, before I die, I'll speak the words that burn in me; And you may send them, bye-and-bye, To Calderon across the sea. Now get some paper and a pen, And sit right here, beside my bed. Write every word I say, and thenâ And then ... well, what then?âI'll be dead!â ... But here I am alive enough, And I remember all I've done ... God knows what I was thinking of!â But send it homeâto Calderon. And you, Francisco, brother, say,â What is there for a man like me?â I tell you God sounds far awayâ As farâalmost as farâas she! I killed her! ... Yes, I poisoned herâ So slowly that she never knew ... Francisco,âI'm a murderer.â Now tell me what there is to do! To dieâof course; but after that, I wonder if I live again! And if I live again, for what?â To suffer? ... Bah!âthere is no pain But one; and that I know so well That I can shame the devil's eyes! ... For twenty years I've heard in hell What Mona sings in Paradise! Strange, that a little Northern girl Should love my brother Calderon, And set my brain so in a whirl That I was mad till she was gone! ... I wonder if all men be such As I?âI wonder what love is!â I never loved her very much Until I saw that she was his;â And then I knew that I was lost: And thenâI knew that I was mad.â I reasoned what it all would cost, But that was nothing.âI was glad To feel myself so foul a thing!â And I was glad for Calderon. ... My God! if he could hear her sing Just once, as I do!âThere! she's done. ... No, it was only something wrong A minuteâsomething in my head.â God, no!âshe'll never stop that song As long as I'm alive or dead! As long as I am here or there, She'll sing to me, a murderer!â Well, I suppose the gods are fair. ... I killed her ... yes, I poisoned her! But you, Francisco,âyou are young;â So take my hand and hear me, now:â There are no lies upon your tongue, There is no guilt upon your brow.â But there is blood upon your name?â And blood, you say, will rust the steel That strikes for honor or for shame? ... Francisco, it is fear you feel!â And such a miserable fear That you, my boy, will call it pride;â But you will grope from year to year Until as last the clouds divide, And all at once you meet the truth, And curse yourself, with helpless rage, For something you have lost with youth And found again, too late, with age. The truth, my brother, is just this:â Your title here is nothing more Or less than what your courage is: The man must put himself before The name, and once the master stay Foreverâor forever fall.â Good-bye!âRemember what I say ... Good-bye;âGood-by! ... And that was all. The lips were still: the man was dead.â Francisco, with a weird surprise, Stood like a stranger by the bed, And there were no tears in his eyes. But in his heart there was a grief Too strong for human tears to free,â And in his hand a written leaf For Calderon across the sea. THE WORLD Some are the brothers of all humankind, And own them, whatsoever their estate; And some, for sorrow and self-scorn, are blind With enmity for man's unguarded fate. For some there is a music all day long Like flutes in Paradise, they are so glad; And there is hell's eternal under-song Of curses and the cries of men gone mad. Some say the Scheme with love stands luminous, Some say 'twere better back to chaos hurled; And so 'tis what we are that makes for us The measure and the meaning of the world. WALT WHITMAN The master-songs are ended, and the man That sang them is a name. And so is God A name; and so is love, and life, and death, And everything. But we, who are too blind To read what we have written, or what faith Has written for us, do not understand: We only blink and wonder. Last night it was the song that was the man, But now it is the man that is the song. We do not hear him very much to-day: His piercing and eternal cadence rings Too pure for usâtoo powerfully pure, Too lovingly triumphant, and too large; But there are some that hear him, and they know That he shall sing to-morrow for all men, And that all time shall listen. The master-songs are ended? Rather say No songs are ended that are ever sung, And that no names are dead names. When we write Men's letters on proud marble or on sand, We write them there forever. A POEM FOR MAX NORDAU Dun shades quiver down the lone long fallow, And the scared night shudders at the brown owl's cry; The bleak reeds rattle as the winds whirl by, And frayed leaves flutter through the clumped shrubs callow. Chill dews clinging on the low cold mallow Make a steel-keen shimmer where the spent stems lie; Dun shades quiver down the lone long fallow, And the scared night shudders at the brown owl's cry. Pale stars peering through the clouds' curled shallow Make a thin still flicker in a foul round sky; Black damp shadows through the hushed air fly; The lewd gloom wakens to a moon-sad sallow, Dun shades quiver down the lone long fallow. THE NIGHT BEFORE Look you, Dominie; look you, and listen! Look in my face, first; search every line there; Mark every feature,âchin, lips, and forehead! Look in my eyes, and tell me the lesson You read there; measure my nose, and tell me Where I am wanting! A man's nose, Dominie, Is often the cast of his inward spirit; So mark mine well. But why do you smile so? Pity, or what? Is it written all over, This face of mine, with a brute's confession? Nothing but sin there? nothing but hell-scars? Or is it because there is something betterâ A glimmer of good, maybeâor a shadow Of something that's followed me down from childhoodâ Followed me all these years and kept me, Spite of my slips and sins and follies, Spite of my last red sin, my murder,â Just out of hell? Yes? something of that kind? And you smile for that? You're a good man, Dominie, The one good man in the world who knows me,â My one good friend in a world that mocks me, Here in this hard stone cage. But I leave it To-morrow. To-morrow! My God! am I crying? Are these things tears? Tears? What! am I frightened? I, who swore I should go to the scaffold With big strong steps, andâNo more. I thank you, But noâI am all right now! No!âlisten! I am here to be hanged; to be hanged to-morrow At six o'clock, when the sun is rising. And why am I here? Not a soul can tell you But this poor shivering thing before you, This fluttering wreck of the man God made him, For God knows what wild reason. Hear me, And learn from my lips the truth of my story. There's nothing strange in what I shall tell you, Nothing mysterious, nothing unearthly,â But damnably human,âand you shall hear it. Not one of those little black lawyers had guessed it; The judge, with his big bald head, never knew it; And the jury (God rest their poor souls!) never dreamed it. Once there were three in the world who could tell it; Now there are two. There'll be two to-morrow,â You, my friend, andâBut there's the story:â When I was a boy the world was heaven. I never knew then that the men and the women Who petted and called me a brave big fellow Were ever less happy than I; but wisdomâ Which comes with the years, you knowâsoon showed me The secret of all my glittering childhood, The broken key to the fairies' castle That held my life in the fresh, glad season When I was the king of the earth. Then slowlyâ And yet so swiftly!âthere came the knowledge That the marvellous life I had lived was my life; That the glorious world I had loved was my world; And that every man, and every woman, And every child was a different being, Wrought with a different heat, and fired With passions born of a single spirit; That the pleasure I felt was not their pleasure, Nor my sorrowâa kind of nameless pity For something, I knew not whatâtheir sorrow. And thus was I taught my first hard lesson,â The lesson we suffer the most in learning: That a happy man is a man forgetful Of all the torturing ills around him. When or where I first met the woman I cherished and made my wife, no matter. Enough to say that I found her and kept her Here in my heart with as pure a devotion As ever Christ felt for his brothers. Forgive me For naming His name in your patient presence; But I feel my words, and the truth I utter Is God's own truth. I loved that woman,â Not for her face, but for something fairer, Something diviner, I thought, than beauty: I loved the spiritâthe human something That seemed to chime with my own condition, And make soul-music when we were together; And we were never apart, from the moment My eyes flashed into her eyes the message That swept itself in a quivering answer Back through my strange lost being. My pulses Leapt with an aching speed; and the measure Of this great world grew small and smaller, Till it seemed the sky and the land and the ocean Closed at last in a mist all golden Around us two. And we stood for a season Like gods outflung from chaos, dreaming That we were the king and the queen of the fire That reddened the clouds of love that held us Blind to the new world soon to be oursâ Ours to seize and sway. The passion Of that great love was a nameless passion, Bright as the blaze of the sun at noonday, Wild as the flames of hell; but, mark you, Never a whit less pure for its fervor. The baseness in me (for I was human) Burned like a worm, and perished; and nothing Was left me then but a soul that mingled Itself with hers, and swayed and shuddered In fearful triumph. When I consider That helpless love and the cursed folly That wrecked my life for the sake of a woman Who broke with a laugh the chains of her marriage (Whatever the word may mean), I wonder If all the woe was her sin, or whether The chains themselves were enough to lead her In love's despite to break them. ... Sinners And saintsâI sayâare rocked in the cradle, But never are known till the will within them Speaks in its own good time. So I foster Even to-night for the woman who wronged me, Nothing of hate, nor of love, but a feeling Of still regret; for the manâBut hear me, And judge for yourself:â For a time the seasons Changed and passed in a sweet succession That seemed to me like an endless music: Life was a rolling psalm, and the choirs Of God were glad for our love. I fancied All this, and more than I dare to tell you To-night,âyes, more than I dare to remember; And thenâwell, the music stopped. There are moments In all men's lives when it stops, I fancy,â Or seems to stop,âtill it comes to cheer them Again with a larger sound. The curtain Of life just then is lifted a little To give to their sight new joysânew sorrowsâ Or nothing at all, sometimes. I was watching The slow, sweet scenes of a golden picture, Flushed and alive with a long delusion That made the murmur of home, when I shuddered And felt like a knife that awful silence That comes when the music goesâforever. The truth came over my life like a darkness Over a forest where one man wanders, Worse than alone. For a time I staggered And stumbled on with a weak persistence After the phantom of hope that darted And dodged like a frightened thing before me, To quit me at last, and vanish. Nothing Was left me then but the curse of living And bearing through all my days the fever And thirst of a poisoned love. Were I stronger, Or weaker, perhaps my scorn had saved me, Given me strength to crush my sorrow With hate for her and the world that praised herâ To have left her, then and thereâto have conquered That old false life with a new and a wiser,â Such things are easy in words. You listen, And frown, I suppose, that I never mention That beautiful word, forgive!âI forgave her First of all; and I praised kind Heaven That I was a brave, clean man to do it; And then I tried to forget. Forgiveness! What does it mean when the one forgiven Shivers and weeps and clings and kisses The credulous fool that holds her, and tells him A thousand things of a good man's mercy, And then slips off with a laugh and plunges Back to the sin she has quit for a season, To tell him that hell and the world are better For her than a prophet's heaven? Believe me, The love that dies ere its flames are wasted In search of an alien soul is better, Better by far than the lonely passion That burns back into the heart and feeds it. For I loved her still, and the more she mocked me,â Fooled with her endless pleading promise Of future faith,âthe more I believed her The penitent thing she seemed; and the stronger Her choking arms and her small hot kisses Bound me and burned my brain to pity, The more she grew to the heavenly creature That brightened the life I had lost forever. The truth was gone somehow for the moment; The curtain fell for a time; and I fancied We were again like gods together, Loving again with the old glad rapture. But scenes like these, too often repeated, Failed at last, and her guile was wasted. I made an end of her shrewd caresses And told her a few straight words. She took them Full at their worthâand the farce was over. At first my dreams of the past upheld me, But they were a short support: the present Pushed them away, and I fell. The mission Of life (whatever it was) was blasted; My game was lost. And I met the winner Of that foul deal as a sick slave gathers His painful strength at the sight of his master; And when he was past I cursed him, fearful Of that strange chance which makes us mighty Or mean, or both. I cursed him and hated The stones he pressed with his heel; I followed His easy march with a backward envy, And cursed myself for the beast within me. But pride is the master of love, and the vision Of those old days grew faint and fainter: The counterfeit wife my mercy sheltered Was nothing now but a woman,âa woman Out of my way and out of my nature. My battle with blinded love was over, My battle with aching pride beginning. If I was the loser at first, I wonder If I am the winner now! ... I doubt it. My life is a losing game; and to-morrowâ To-morrow!âChrist! did I say to-morrow? ... Is your brandy good for death? ... There,âlisten:â When loves goes out, and a man is driven To shun mankind for the scars that make him A joke for all chattering tongues, he carries A double burden. The woes I suffered After that hard betrayal made me Pity, at first, all breathing creatures On this bewildered earth. I studied Their faces and made for myself the story Of all their scattered lives. Like brothers And sisters they seemed to me then; and I nourished A stranger friendship wrought in my fancy Between those people and me. But somehow, As time went on, there came queer glances Out of their eyes, and the shame that stung me Harassed my pride with a crazed impression That every face in the surging city Was turned to me; and I saw sly whispers, Now and then, as I walked and wearied My wasted life twice over in bearing With all my sorrow the sorrows of others,â Till I found myself their fool. Then I trembled,â A poor scared thing,âand their prying faces Told me the ghastly truth: they were laughing At me and my fate. My God, I could feel itâ That laughter! And then the children caught it; And I, like a struck dog, crept and listened. And then when I met the man who had weakened A woman's love to his own desire, It seemed to me that all hell were laughing In fiendish concert! I was their victimâ And his, and hate's. And there was the struggle! As long as the earth we tread holds something A tortured heart can love, the meaning Of life is not wholly blurred; but after The last loved thing in the world has left us, We know the triumph of hate. The glory Of good goes out forever; the beacon Of sin is the light that leads us downwardâ Down to the fiery end. The road runs Right through hell; and the souls that follow The cursed ways where its windings lead them Suffer enough, I say, to merit All grace that a God can give.âThe fashion Of our belief is to lift all beings Born for a life that knows no struggle In sin's tight snares to eternal gloryâ All apart from the branded millions Who carry through life their faces graven With sure brute scars that tell the story Of their foul, fated passions. Science Has yet no salve to smooth or soften The cradle-scars of a tyrant's visage; No drugs to purge from the vital essence Of souls the sleeping venom. Virtue May flower in hell, when its roots are twisted And wound with the roots of vice; but the stronger Never is known till there comes that battle With sin to prove the victor. Perilous Things are these demons we call our passions: Slaves are we of their roving fancies, Fools of their devilish glee.âYou think me, I know, in this maundering way designing To lighten the load of my guilt and cast it Half on the shoulders of God. But hear me! I'm partly a man,âfor all my weakness,â If weakness it were to stand and murder Before men's eyes the man who had murdered Me, and driven my burning forehead With horns for the world to laugh at. Trust me! And try to believe my words but a portion Of what God's purpose made me! The coward Within me cries for this; and I beg you Now, as I come to the end, to remember That women and men are on earth to travel All on a different road. Hereafter The roads may meet. ... I trust in somethingâ I know not what. ... Well, this was the way of it:â Stung with the shame and the secret fury That comes to the man who has thrown his pittance Of self at a traitor's feet, I wandered Weeks and weeks in a baffled frenzy, Till at last the devil spoke. I heard him, And laughed at the love that strove to touch me,â The dead, lost love; and I gripped the demon Close to my breast, and held him, praising The fates and the furies that gave me the courage To follow his wild command. Forgetful Of all to come when the work was over,â There came to me then no stony vision Of these three hundred days,âI cherished An awful joy in my brain. I pondered And weighed the thing in my mind, and gloried In life to think that I was to conquer Death at his own dark door,âand chuckled To think of it done so cleanly. One evening I knew that my time had come. I shuddered A little, but rather for doubt than terror, And followed him,âled by the nameless devil I worshipped and called my brother. The city Shone like a dream that night; the windows Flashed with a piercing flame, and the pavements Pulsed and swayed with a warmthâor something That seemed so then to my feetâand thrilled me With a quick, dizzy joy; and the women And men, like marvellous things of magic, Floated and laughed and sang by my shoulder, Sent with a wizard motion. Through it And over and under it all there sounded A murmur of life, like bees; and I listened And laughed again to think of the flower That grew, blood-red, for me! ... This fellow Was one of the popular sort who flourish Unruffled where gods would fall. For a conscience He carried a snug deceit that made him The man of the time and the place, whatever The time or the place might be. Were he sounding, With a genial craft that cloaked its purpose, Nigh to itself, the depth of a woman Fooled with his brainless art, or sending The midnight home with songs and bottles,â The cad was there, and his ease forever Shone with the smooth and slippery polish That tells the snake. That night he drifted Into an up-town haunt and orderedâ Whatever it wasâwith a soft assurance That made me mad as I stood behind him, Gripping his death, and waited. Coward, I think, is the name the world has given To men like me; but I'll swear I never Thought of my own disgrace when I shot himâ Yes, in the back,âI know it, I know it Now; but what if I do? ... As I watched him Lying there dead in the scattered sawdust, Wet with a day's blown froth, I noted That things were still; that the walnut tables, Where men but a moment before were sitting, Were gone; that a screen of something around me Shut them out of my sight. But the gilded Signs of a hundred beers and whiskeys Flashed from the walls above, and the mirrors And glasses behind the bar were lighted In some strange way, and into my spirit A thousand shafts of terrible fire Burned like death, and I fell. The story Of what came then, you know. But tell me, What does the whole thing mean? What are we,â Slaves of an awful ignorance? puppets Pulled by a fiend? or gods, without knowing it? Do we shut from ourselves our own salvation,â Or what do we do! I tell you, Dominie, There are times in the lives of us poor devils When heaven and hell get mixed. Though conscience May come like a whisper of Christ to warn us Away from our sins, it is lost or laughed at,â And then we fall. And for all who have fallenâ Even for himâI hold no malice, Nor much compassion: a mightier mercy Than mine must shrive him.âAnd IâI am going Into the light?âor into the darkness? Why do I sit through these sickening hours, And hope? Good God! are they hours?âhours? Yes! I am done with days. And to-morrowâ We two may meet! To-morrow!âTo-morrow! ... SHOOTING STARS When ardent summer skies are bright With myriad friendly lamps that glow Down from their dark, mysterious height To charm the shrouded earth belowâ Lost in a faith we do not know, Nor human discord ever jars With eyes that wide and wider grow, He sits and waits for shooting stars. And when they slide across the night Like arrows from a Titan's bow, He shudders for supreme delight And shouts to see them scamper so, No sneering science comes to show The poor brain crossed with silly scars; But flushed with joys that overflow, He sits and waits for shooting stars. We call him an unlovely wight; But if his wit be something slow, Nor ever weary of the sight That Adam saw so long agoâ Released from knowledge and its woe, No gloom his constant rapture mars:â Oblivious from head to toe, He sits and waits for shooting stars. ENVOY Nor is it yet for us, I trow, To mock him, or to shut the bars Of scorn against himâeven though He sits and waits for shooting stars. OCTAVE Saints of all times I love, but I love best The saints that never yet were calendered. Their silence is my shame, their life my life; Their pleasure is my pleasure, and their grief My guide forever. Grief that knows itself Soon glorifies itself; and some rough man With no name but his own may tell me more Of God than all the tomes of printed prayers. THE IDEALIST Idealist?âOh yes, or what you will. I do not wrangle any more with namesâ I only want the Truth. Give me the Truth, And let the system go; give me the Truth, And I stand satisfied. Fame, glory, gold,â Take them, and keep them. They were never mineâ I do not ask for them. I only ask That I, and you, and you, may get the Truth! TWO OCTAVES I Not by the grief that suns and overwhelms All outward recognition of revealed And righteous omnipresence are the days Of most of us affrighted and diseased, But rather by the common snarls of life That come to test us and to strengthen us In this the prentice-age of discontent, Rebelliousness, faint-heartedness, and shame. II When through hot fog the fulgid sun looks down Upon a stagnant earth where listless men Laboriously dawdle, curse, and sweat, Disqualified, unsatisfied, inert,â It seems to me somehow that God himself Scans with a close reproach what I have done, Counts with an unphrased patience my arrears, And fathoms my unprofitable thoughts. OCTAVES I To get at the eternal strength of things, And fearlessly to make strong songs of it, Is, to my mind, the mission of that man The world would call a poet. He may sing But roughly, and withal ungraciously; But if he touch to life the one right chord Wherein God's music slumbers, and awake To truth one drowsed ambition, he sings well. II To mortal ears the plainest word may ring Fantastic and unheard-of, and as false And out of tune as ever to our own Did ring the prayers of man-made maniacs; But if that word be the plain word of Truth, It leaves an echo that begets itself, Persistent in itself and of itself, Regenerate, reiterate, replete. ROMANCE I BOYS We were all boys, and three of us were friends; And we were more than friends, it seemed to me:â Yes, we were more than brothers then, we three ... Brothers? ... But we were boys, and there it ends. II JAMES WETHERELL We never half believed the stuff They told about James Wetherell; We always liked him well enough, And always tried to use him well; But now some things have come to light, And James has vanished from our view,â There isn't very much to write, There isn't very much to do. LIMERICKS [1] There was a calm man in Sabattis Who shot at a skunk through a lattice. The skunk became dead. âI got him,â he said, âAnd now let me see where my hat is.â [2] There's this about the Hindu He does the best he kin do, But when he wants A pair of pants He has to make his skin do. [3] There was a pale artist named Ransom, Whose hands were exceedingly handsome. To be sure they were seen He painted them green And held them all day through the transom. PLUMMER STREET, GARDINER, MAINE What are those houses doing in a row? What is it that makes everything so queer? Was it a dream of mine, or was it here Van Amburgh used to come so long ago?â So long ago? If it was not last year, When was it, then, the place was all arrayed With tents and elephants and lemonade, Lifting-machines, freaks, peanuts, and pop-beer? Where are they gone now? Tell me, if you can, Where is the giant? and the tattooed man, Where are the clowns that once were garrulous? Where are the people who âperformedâ on bars? Where are the targets and âten-cent cigarsâ Gone now? Where is the Hipper Pottamus? TWILIGHT SONG [2 stanzas, following stanza 1] We have worked, we have played, We have won the day's grace, And at noon through the shade Read the sun face to face; We have won the sun's touch, We have seen the leaf curl, And we've sold the King's crutch For a boy and a girl; We have heard the girl sing To the tune the Queen made, We have called the boy King, We have worked, we have played. We have loved, we have sung, We have shared the day's joy, And the wide skies have rung With a âlong live the Boy!â We have seen the boy ride With the King's cloak and spurs, And the Queen by his side With the girl's hand in hers; We've a long way to go, But the King's knell is rung; And we're glad now to know We have loved, we have sung. AU REVOIR (MARCH 23, 1909.) What libellers of destiny Are these who are afraid That something yet without a name Will seize him in the shade? Though fever-demons may compound Their most malefic brew, No fever can defeat the man Who still has work to do; Though mighty lions walk about, Inimical to see, No lion yet has ever fed On things that are to be. Wherefore, and of necessity, Will he meet what may come; And from a nation will be missed As others are from home. VARIATIONS OF GREEK THEMES, V WITH SAPPHO'S COMPLIMENTS But you are dead nowâyes, you areâ And what you say will not go far; I don't think any one I knew Was ever quite so dead as you. I'll say no more, for what remains? You must have known you had no brains; For you had nothing but your looks, And you would never read my books. So now you'll hate yourself, and hide Where most ignoble shades abide; But I'll not make your spirit sad, For you are dead nowâand I'm glad. BEN JONSON ENTERTAINS A MAN FROM STRATFORD [Following line 318: âHe's fribbling all the time with that damned House.â] But he's not of our time, or any time; He's of all time. He needs Greek, even at that,â And a little braver manner with a shilling O' mornings for the more nefarious And out o' nights, who are to be forgotten; Though I'd assure yeâand I'm saying thisâ The worthy, for a word, may have his breeches. NIMMO'S EYES [Following stanza 6] And think of Nimmo's eyes; and if you can, Remember something in them that was wrong. A casual thing to ask of any man, You tell me,âand you laugh? You won't laugh long. [Following stanza 15] She makes an epic of an episode, I tell her, and the toil is ruinous; And I may tell her till I go the road We find alone, the best and worst of us. HANNIBAL BROWN An Alcaic Although his wish was never to baffle us Hannibal Brown was dolichocephalous. His head reached half way up to heaven. Hannibal's hat was a number seven. BROADWAY By night a gay leviathan That fades before the sunâ A monster with a million eyes Without the sight of oneâ A coruscating thing with claws To tear the soul apartâ Breaker of men and avenues, It throbs, and has no heart. By day it has another life That feeds on hopes and dreams; And wears, to cover what it is, The mask of what it seems. But soon its iridescent length Will make a fiery show, To cheer, to dazzle, or to scorch The wingless moths below. And if, at cynic intervals, And like a thing in pain, By chance it implicates itself With something not insane, It will not often, nor for long, Relinquish what allures With everything that has the shine Of nothing that endures. A WREATH FOR EDWIN MARKHAM Time, always writing, sees no trace Of all he writes on Markham's face. On Markham's face he writes in vain: Apollo rubs it out again. TOO MUCH COFFEE Together in infinite shade They defy the invincible dawn: The Measure that never was made, The Line that never was drawn. FORTUNATUS Be as you are; your story is all told, And all without the cost of augury. Nothing in years, nothing in chance or fate, May dent the mail of your complacency. Be as you are, and always as you are; Grope for no more than may be requisite. You are among the chosen of the world Who serve it best when unaware of it. For while you see it as it never was, Your ministration will not be in vain; You will ameliorate the mystery Somewhat in seeing so little to explain. You will not see the drama of dead lives That are behind calm faces and closed doors; You will not feel the weight of heavy chains That others wear that you may not wear yours; You will not hear the breathing of the beast That has been history since there was man; And seeing not much that need be different, You will not wonder why it all began. You will not have to see how small a place Will be enough to make of you a king; You will have all there is for you to use, And having little will have everything. MODRED A FRAGMENT Time and the dark Had come, but not alone. The southern gate That had been open wide for Lancelot Made now an entrance for three other men, Who strode along the gravel or the grass, Careless of who should hear them. When they came To the great oak and the two empty chairs, One paused, and held the others with a tongue That sang an evil music while it spoke: âSit here, my admirable Colgrevance, And you, my gentle Agravaine, sit here. For me, well I have had enough of sitting; And I have heard enough and seen enough To blast a kingdom into kingdom come, Had I so fierce a mindâwhich happily I have not, for the king here is my father. There's been a comment and a criticism Abounding, I believe, in Camelot For some time at my undeserved expense, But God forbid that I should make my father Less happy than he will be when he knows What I shall have to tell him presently; And that will only be what he has known Since Merlin, or the ghost of Merlin, came Two years ago to warn him. Though he sees, One thing he will not see; and this must end. We must have no blind kings in Camelot, Or we shall have no land worth harrowing, And our last harvest will be food for strangers. My father, as you know, has gone a-hunting.â âWe know about the king,â said Agravaine, âAnd you know more than any about the queen. We are still waiting, Modred. Colgrevance And I are waiting.â Modred laughed at him Indulgently: âDid I say more than any? If so, then inadvertently I erred; For there is one man here, one Lancelot, Who knows, I fancy, a deal more than I do, And I know much. Yes, I know more than much. Yet who shall snuff the light of what he knows To blind the king he serves? No, Agravaine, A wick like that would smoke and smell of treason.â âYour words are mostly smoke, if I may say so,â Said Colgrevance: âWhat is it you have seen, And what are we to do? I wish no ill To Lancelot. I know no evil of him, Or of the queen; and I'll hear none of either, Save what you, on your oath, may tell me now. I look yet for the trail of your dark fancy To blur your testament.â âNo, Colgrevance, There are no blurs or fancies exercising Tonight where I am. Lancelot will ascend Anon, betimes, and with no drums or shawms To sound the appointed progress of his feet; And he will not be lost along the way, For there are landmarks and he knows them all. No, Colgrevance, there are no blurs or fancies Unless it be that your determination Has made them for your purpose what they seem. But here I beg your pardon, Colgrevance. We reticent ones are given to say too much, With our tongues once in action. Pray forgive. Your place tonight will be a shadowed alcove, Where you may see this knight without a stain While he goes in where no man save the king Has dared before to follow. Agravaine And I will meet you on the floor below, Having already beheld this paragon-Joseph Go by us for your clinching observation. Then we, with a dozen or so for strength, will act; And there shall be no more of Lancelot.â âModred, I wish no ill to Lancelot, And I know none of him,â said Colgrevance. âMy dream is of a sturdier way than this For me to serve my king. Give someone else That alcove, and let me be of the twelve. I swear it irks the marrow of my soul To shadow Lancelotâthough I may fight him, If so it is to be. Furthermore, Modred, You gave me not an inkling of the part That you have read off now so pleasantly For me to play. No, Modred, by the God Who knows the right way and the wrong, I'll be This night no poisonous inhabitant Of alcoves in your play, not even for you. No man were more the vassal of his friend Than I am, but I'm damned if I'll be owned.â In a becoming darkness Modred smiled Away the first accession of his anger. âSay not like that,â he answered, musically. âBe temperate, Colgrevance. Remember always Your knighthood and your birth. Remember, too, That I may hold him only as my friend Who loves me for myself, not for my station. We're born for what we're born for, Colgrevance; And you and I and Agravaine are born To serve our king. It's all for the same end, Whether we serve in alcoves, or behind A velvet arras on another floor. What matters it, if we be loyal menâ With only one defection?â âWhich isâwhat?â Said Agravaine, who breathed hard and said little, Albeit he had no fame abroad for silence. âDelayâprocrastinationâovercautionâ Or what word now assimilates itself The best with your inquiring mood, my brother. These operations that engage us now Were planned and executed long ago, Had I but acted then on what was written No less indelibly than at this hour, Though maybe not so scorchingly on me. âIf there were only Modred in the way,ââ I heard her saying itââwould you come tonight?â Saint Brandan! How she nuzzled and smothered him! Forgive me, Colgrevance, when I say more Than my raw vanity may reconcile With afterthought. But that was what she said To Lancelot, and that was what I heard. And what I saw was of an even bias With all she told him here. God, what a woman! She floats about the court so like a lily, That even I'd be fooled were I the king, Seeing with his eyes what I would not see. But now the stars are crying in their courses For this to end, and we are men to end it. Meanwhile, for the king's hunting and his health, We have tonight a sort of wassailing; Wherefore we may as well address ourselves, Against our imminent activities, To something in the way of trencher serviceâ Which also is a service to the king. For they who serve must eat. God save the King!â They took the way of Lancelot along The darkened hedges to the palace lights, With Modred humming lowly to himself A chant of satisfaction. Colgrevance, Not healed of an essential injury, Nor given the will to cancel his new pledge To Modred, made with neither knowing why, Passed in without a word, leaving his two Companions hesitating on the steps Outside, one scowling and the other smiling. âModred, you may have gone an inch too far With Colgrevance tonight. Why set a trap For trouble? We've enough with no additions. His fame is that of one among the faithful, Without a fear, and fearless without guile.â âAnd that is why we need him, Agravaine,â Said Modred, with another singing laugh. âHe'll go as was appointed by his fate For my necessity. A man to achieve High deeds must have a Colgrevance or two Around him for unused emergencies, And for the daily sweat. Your Colgrevance May curse himself till he be violet, Yet he will do your work. There is none else, Apparently, that God will let him do.â âNot always all of it,â said Agravaine. But Modred answered with another laugh And led the way in to the wassailing, Where Dagonet was trolling a new song To Lancelot, who smiledâas if in pain To see so many friends and enemies, All cheering him, all drinking, and all gay.</field>
