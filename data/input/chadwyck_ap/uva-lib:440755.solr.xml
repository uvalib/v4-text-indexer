      <field name="fulltext">THE VOLUNTEER LAUREAT. AN ODE; For the BIRTH-DAY of the PRESIDENT of the UNITED STATES. Oft has the Poet's venal song, Correctly mean, and elegantly low, Told the false plaudits of the courtly throng, And wak'd a smile on guilty Grandeur's brow. But here hath Virtue's guardian hand Torn from the Syren, Adulation's power The Man, whose praiseâthe voice of every landâ Hangs on the lips of every parting hour. Here, can no Poet's venal song Echo the praises of a courtly throng; Nor the poor wealth of many a powerful State, Buy a new honor for the truly great: For here, the Muse's noblest lays But speak a Nation's answering praise; And here, can heaven-descended verse Nought but the glories of his name rehearse. Daughter of Heaven! awake the enobling lyre! Breathe thy full influence; every cord inspire; Exalt the soul to dignity of song; Swell every note, and every strain prolong. The answering Spirit trembles o'er the strings; Things, more than earthly, dance before my sight; Hark! with her voice the empyrean rings; The Past, lies all reveal'd; the Future lives in light. âThe voice of Horror echoes far; âResponds, the direful whoop of war; âThunders, the mighty tube of death; âThe knife red gleams upon the heath; âGroans load the air, shrieks rend the skies; âThe crimson standard wildly flies; âImpatient slaughter loudly calls; âThe Chief of Tho'tless Valor falls. â'Gainst all the terrors of the field, âThe Chief of Virtue rears his shield; âSecure, the train diminish'd move; âAnd weeping Britain smiles in love. âSee, demon Danger's horrid form, âWith dire Oppression strong allied, âHangs o'er the landâand wakes the storm; âAnd swells, of deep calamity; the tide. âSee, in their train Destruction stalk; âAnd Giant Vengeance threatening walk; âAnd red-clad Envy ride the empoison'd gale; âAnd jealous Grandeur spread the impatient sail. âGreatly inspir'd, his country lifts her voiceâ âSee Danger trembles at his awful name; âTyrant Oppression views her fainting flame; âAnd gasping Freedom breathes but to rejoice. âDark o'er the field of Liberty and Right, âOf sad Dismay, hangs low the deepen'd gloom: âWide spreads the flash of Trenton's bloody light; âAnd Freedom, glorying, rises from the tomb. âStrong in himselfâhe scatters wide the storm; âCalms the wild raging of the troubled tide; âO'erthrows Destruction; Vengeance joins his side; âAnd Envy kneels in Adoration's form. âLin'd with red Hosts the ramparts shine; âOppos'd, the brother armies join; âThe brazen Thunders ope their throats; âOn all the air the Tempest floats: âTheir Captives guarded, see the bands retire, âAnd jealous Grandeur at the view expire. âHis Country sav'd, o'er Cincinnatus great, âHe tills the soil, and guides the arts of Peace. âBut see! new Glory bursts the womb of Fate! âNew toils demand him from the promis'd case! âThe voice of millions lift him o'er the realm âWhich once his valor from oppression freed; âPowerful in virtue, now he rules the helmâ âIn Warâin Peaceâthe blest of Heaven succeed. âO born to grace and dignify mankind! âYears long await theeâTime himself shall stay âTill thou hast op'd, resplendent on the mind, âTh' immortal brightness of the moral day. âTis thine to spread new virtue o'er the Earth; âTo breathe the soul of liberty in man; âTo brace Creation to a glorious birth; âAnd charm Perfection to complete the Plan.â Favor'd of Heaven! the Muse in rapture faints, Thy grateful country strives, in vain, to sing; The Earth uplifts her hands in joyâthe Saints Respond in Peans to each speaking string. âLong may'st thou liveââthe Soul of Nature criesâ âGreatest of MortalsâFavorite of the Skies.â ELLA. SONNET I. Sent to Miss ? ?, with a Braid of Hair. See also J. Bringhurst in Landmark Anthologies. Fair shews the rose, but soon its beauty fades, And soon its balmy-breathing fragrance fails; The downy peach, sweet pear, DECAY assails, And clustered purples of the vine invades. Nor does alone the vegetative realm Feel the destroyer's over-bearing power; He joys in ruin, cities to o'erwhelm, To shake the column, and to sink the tower. Nor yet can Beauty, radiant as the morn, Escape his wrath. The rosy cheek he pales; O'er all the lily of the skin prevails; And flowing honors that the head adorn. The soul, refined in sentiment and truth, Derides his power, and smiles eternal youth. ELLA. SONNET II. Sent to Mrs. ? ?, with a Song. See also J. Bringhurst in Landmark Anthologies. Blest is the Poet if his songs can raise Some kindred genius that will catch the fire, With answering notes awake the trembling lyre, And give to far posterity his praise. Yet double pleasure fills his aged days, If chance, responsive to his fond desire, While from the lips of youth the notes aspire, In the warm breast the flame of virtue blaze. And still a greater pleasure, should he spy That while from Virtue's breast the music flows, Caught by the song, the voice, the speaking eye, In every heart the illustrious purpose glows. Even he, the Poet, nobler worth should warm By virtue, greatly rous'd, in ?'s form. ELLA. SONNET III. Sent to Miss. ? ?, See also J. Bringhurst in Landmark Anthologies. Now o'er the world hath sober Evening spread Her ebon-tinctured veilâthe stars appearâ The smiling Moon in mildest beauty clear, As on my hand I press my pensive head. While not on earth is heard one echoing tread, Look thro' the Southern uprais'd window near. Down on my cheek tear courses after tearâ I think on absent friends, on pleasures fled. Now all their actions living in my sight Awake new, mournful, pleasures in my soul, And each memento gives a fresh delight. Do not such joys my fair one's mind controul? They doâI see th' assenting tear descendâ And she will love this trifle for the friend. ELLA. ODE. TO BIRTHA. See also J. Bringhurst in Landmark Anthologies. Poor, and unknown, a stranger to the great, While now, with holy veneration deep inspir'd, To Him, whose virtue glads the extending state, Wak'd by the voice of Truth, my soul to song is fir'd. And now, while Friendship, trembling o'er the strings, Breathes on the lyre unutterable things, And steals its ancient, and neglected store: Hark! o'er the wild-resounding air, What music floats, in varied numbers near, And winds, in wildering echoes, down the dashing shore! Again, in full, deep sounds, it loads the swelling gale; And now, it softly undulates the breeze; And now, a small, still voice, the notes my soul assail, With calm delight responsive; now they seize, In bolder swellings, on the impassion'd mind, That feels its different powers refin'd, As now, with many a slowly-solemn pause, they fail. O Thou, whose fingers from the answering lyre Draw sounds so flattering to the Youth of Song, Deep from my soul the grateful sighs aspire, That hail the enjoyment which they would prolong. Life hath trifling joys to give; Not in Life doth pleasure live; Tomb of pleasure, tomb of joy, Ever anxious to destroy: Shrouding in thy narrow space Every virtue, every grace. Tyrant! soon thy reign is o'er, Radiant glory bursts thy door. Love, who all thy power defies, Rising, mingles with the skies. Now, even now, I scorn thy wrathâ Glory brightens round my path. Now thy yawning gates unfold, While the powerful charm is told. See, my soul, in fancy riseâ BIRTHA, seraph, opes the skies. ELLA. SONNET IV. See also J. Bringhurst in Landmark Anthologies. A down the melancholy stream of life Who joys the vessel of his Years to guide? Nor fears the roarings of th' incertain tide, The inclement Winter, or the Ocean's strife? And who, regardful of his certain end, Can bear the incessant struggles of his Youth; Force thro enticement to an age of truth; And welcome Death as freely as his friend? Who, that when Poverty's torpedo hand Has chill'd even Charity's soft-answering soul; When green-eyed Malice hunts him thro the land, Can smile serene, superior to the whole? He, who the paths of Rectitude has trodâ His friendsâhis life, his conscience, and his God. ELLA. SONNET, V. See also J. Bringhurst in Landmark Anthologies. âSay, what is Life?â the sons of sorrow cryâ âIs it to breathe a lingering age of woe âIn vegetative being here below? âTo eat, to drink, to sleep, and thenâto die?â âIs it in Pleasure's airy rounds to fly? âTo laugh, to dance?ââthe souls of Joy would knowâ âTo plunge in lewdness, and no care bestow âOn what may greatly fit us for the sky?â No.âTis the Twilight of a heavenly Day, Whose radiant glories opening on the Soul, Shall raise, and bear it, from itself away, Far o'er the bounds of this terrestrial pole, Wak'd to new rapture by the living lay, Where GOD informs the immeasurable whole. ELLA. SONNET VI. TO EGWINA. See also J. Bringhurst in Landmark Anthologies. Go verse, soft-whispering, to Egwina sayâ 'Tis not that rich complexion's lucent white, Tinged with the Rose's fragrance-blushing light, O'er all her lovely features loves to stray; Nor yet, that Nature, with a fond display, Hath spread her auburn tresses on the sight, And fram'd her lips the seal of sweet delight, And op'd her eyes resplendent on the day; Tell her 'tis not, that o'er each motion, Grace Sheds a soft lustre, as she deigns to move, Giving new beauties to the ambient place; That every tho't, and all my soul, is love. But, that her mind, its radiant worth to prove, Imprints the soul of Beauty on her Face. ELLA. ODE TO BIRTHA. See also J. Bringhurst in Landmark Anthologies. Soft o'er my soul the voice of music breathes, Waking the sympathies which thrill delight. The Mental Spirit hails seraphic light Heavenly Visions fill the sight. Glory hangs immortal wreaths; Joy the Harp divine unsheaths; Echo answering as it rings, Female Virtue strikes the strings. Nearly allied the trembling Passions live: And all the Emotions of the human mind, In mystic bands united, fondly give Mingling responses, tremulously join'd. Now tranquil Pleasure softly moves along. Touching the cord to which mild Melancholy's voice, In answers low, awakes the sigh-exciting song, Making sweet Pity's tear-suffused eyes rejoice, As now, in awful tho't sublime, She sees the immortal Spirit triumph over Time. O Thou whose soul, responsive, wakes the lyrel Throw off, of gorgeous praise, the rich attire, And, with united labours, let us toil, To raise the mind to energy of tho't; To bid Morality attractive smile; And deep impress what Heaven itself hath taught. O let us strive, with union'd hearts sincere; To form the patriot soul to deed severe; To draw the sympathetic tear; To bid of love the generous transports glow; The ennobling warmth of friendship flow; And kind compassion's hand In extacy expand, To soothe Misfortune's woe. O let us wake the Imaginative Powers Whose smiles give pleasure to the passing hours; Whose kind progression weans the heart From earth, and all its low concerns, And bids it, anxious, wish that better part, That home, for which the immortal Spirit yearns; Which draws it, sweetly, from this sad abode, To Heaven, to Happiness, to GOD. This be our praiseâThat Virtue, Truth, inspire; And Human Bliss, breathes o'er the echoing lyre. ELLA. SONNET, Written after hearing a SONG sung by several SISTERS. See also J. Bringhurst in Landmark Anthologies. Hark!âhear'st thou not the sweetly swelling strain Of warbled music float along the air? Soft are the sounds,âthe Sister band how fair! How high flies rapture when it springs from P?yn?. So round the lyre the heavenly Mutes stand, And charm the changing soul with varied joy; So Ella's lays the feeling heart command, And faintly hide Apollo in the boy. Hail charming group! for you shall Fancy rise, To you young Love his earliest homage pay; And while our souls on softened slav'ry stray, Your Minds preserve the conquests of your Eyes; Till ripe you fall, as Heaven and Fame approve, From Beauty's branch, into the lap of Love. HENRY. SONNET, VII. TO THE SUN. See also J. Bringhurst in Landmark Anthologies. Hail Son of Morning! thou, whose orient Smile, While now the dew-drop twinkles on the rose. And richest fragrance o'er the champaign flows, Awakes the slumbering laborer's daily toil. Do e'er thy ruddy splendors gild the pile, As o'er the earth their circling glory glows, Where modest Virtue's unseen hand bestows Joys that the cares of Misery oft beguile? O! if thou dost,âto that sweet cherub sayâ âTho Time, dim-sighted, overlook thy worth; âTho Fame shall fail thy merit to display; âNor glory deck thee, hallow'd of the earth; âYet thou shalt shine in GOD's eternal dayâ âThe heir immortal of a heavenly birth. ELLA. ODE TO HENRY. See also J. Bringhurst in Landmark Anthologies. What bliss the voice of Music gives, While transport in the bosom lives, While virtue, borne on every sound, Spreads love and happiness around! The Soul in purer vision sees The ills of human life retire; And Adoration loads the breeze, With praises that to Heaven aspire. How few the happy power possess The sympathizing heart to bless With pictures of ideal joy, Which strengthen virtue, not destroy! They are the Muse's favorite care; Perfection thro' their souls she breathes; And crowns them, fairest of the fair, With Glory's never-fading wreaths. And He whose song their voice inspires With holy Pleasure's warm desires; With power the trembling lyre to move To accents of immortal love; Shall, robed in modest merit, shine His country's wonder, and its praise; While, bending at her moral shrine, To Truth he consecrates his lays. Him shall the love of nations hail, Born o'er Oppression to prevail; Virtue's own hand shall round his tomb Twine circlets of immortal bloom; The Loves eternal incense burn; The Muses there the Lyre shall place; And Glory shall the simple urn With Henry's name, in transport, grace. ELLA. SONNET VIII. TO THE MOON. See also J. Bringhurst in Landmark Anthologies. Bend from thy throne fair Empress of the Night, And as thou look'st o'er earth with eye serene, Marking thy shadowy paintings on the green, And brightening Heaven with silver-streaming lightâ O! if in all thy course, divinely bright, Thou see'st one wretch, in felon malice mean, Debase the varied beauty of the scene; Or one fell murtherer burst the bands of right; Dart thro' his soul, severely bright, a ray Whose living splendor shall his hand arrest; And to his guilty-conscious spirit sayâ âTho thou may'st live unknown to Law's behest, âAnd hide thy deeds from mortals, and the dayâ âYet Conscience' worm shall rankle in thy breast.â ELLA. TO ELLA. See also J. Bringhurst in Landmark Anthologies. Alighted from the azure sky, A Seraph stood before my sight, And checked awhile the anxious sigh, And pointed to the Realms of Light. Celestial Youth his Features fired, His Eye the Breast with Hope inspired, Virtue's own Hand his Temples crown'd, And Glory shed her Day around. 'Twas Ella!âwrapt in awe I stood, And thrill'd with joy the Vision viewed. Soft as the gentlest shower descends, His soothing accents flowed, And, winding thro' the maze of Song, In playful eddies poured along, Till Nature sighingâsinking bends, And Life a pause bestowed. Cease, Ella, cease thy 'witching Song, Nor lure me from the earthly throng; Too frail to shine in Virtue's Train, Too weak to wake the heavenly Strain, In vain with borrowed Art I soar, For fickle Fancy smiles no more. The feeble Meteor's transient blaze Unnoted sinks in Night; But Nature lives in Sol's bright Rays, And Nations bless his Light. HENRY. ODE TO BIRTHA. See also J. Bringhurst in Landmark Anthologies. And does disease thy bosom grieve? O had I known it at an earlier hour, I would have strove thy sorrows to relieve, Have torn thee from the tyrant Sickness' power, And bade thy aching breast delight receive. I would have sat the lingering, painful, eve, With various talk the lonely moments cheer'd; Have, with unwearied hand, thy head sustain'd Whole nights; and soothed thee as thou had'st complain'd; And heal'd thee with affection long endear'd. For I have known the hand of hard disease; Have felt oppressive sickness at my soul; Seen death-like paleness o'er my features spread; And mark'd the life-supporting current freeze, From hollow eyes, of blue despair, the big tears roll; And join'd, in anguish'd fancy, with the dead. Yet then, even then, I cast a lingering look On all the business of beloved mankind; While each adieu, each fond farewel, I took, Still left a wish, for once more view, behind. 'Twas then new pleasures burst upon my mind, New wishes agitated all my breast; And hope, and passion, and affection, join'd, With life-reviving health again my bosom bless'd. Such are the joys I offer to thy view. For what a greater transport can afford Than to behold affection, virtue new, And lovely goodness, o'er creation pourd? To see refinement new-born raptures shew? And happiness, by you, to earth restored? To see the enchanting smile Of sweet benevolence expand, And o'er the human face diffuse new light; What hath such power affliction to beguile, And soothe the woe-worn heart with comfort bland? What greater pleasure can the soul delight? To let imagination stray, And wanton in celestial day, To see Creation's second birth. And Heaven, descending, bless the Earth; To view new beauty clothe the plain, And rapture hail Messiah's reign; To mark death, anguish, and disease, And vice, no more pollute the breeze; To see perfection's glorious heirs, Triumphant o'er life's little cares, To new attainments daily grow; With nobler virtue hourly glow; And, bosom'd in immortal peace, In God's felicity increase; To love with fresher truth inclined; And gaining on the eternal Mind: What nobler transports can the soul possess? What richer joy the sympathetic bosom bless? ELLA. ODE TO HENRY. See also J. Bringhurst in Landmark Anthologies. With what an anxious, trembling, joy, Doth Modesty his powers employ! While earnest pantings fill his breast, He shrinks with shadowy fears distrest. Warm'd with Fancy's glowing fire, Henry can thy soul desire Far from Virtue's aid to fly? Virtue daughter of the sky. O I had hoped, with fond delight, With thee, ambitious, to unite; With thee to wake the answering lyre; With thee the strength of truth inspire. Now thou fli'st the doubtful field Yet untried, I see thee yield; Shun the stormy face of day, Which to glory points the way. We might have join'd, with studious care, To chase from earth the fiend Despair. To wake new tenderness and truth, New virtue, in the soul of Youth. Might have bade true friendship rise; Love regardless of disguise. Merit garb anew the mind; Worth the glory of mankind. To us the Muse have oped her store With luxury unknown before; Our fainting souls with strength have fired; Our song with energy inspired. Now a tear her cheek bedewsâ âHenry hath forgot the Muse. âSlights the power whose constant care âMakes him lovely to his fair. âTell him, altho the fires of even, âBefore the Sun, are lost in heaven; âLike, are the Muse's splendid rays, âThe glory of the latter days. âRadiance gilds the Poet's sky; âHeavenly visions fill his eye; âTime's dominions unconceal'd, âAll Creation lies reveal'd.â ELLA. LAURA and MARY. See also J. Bringhurst in Landmark Anthologies. âWhy drops the pearly tear from Laura's eye? That eye which used the love-lorn mind to cheer; Why heaves that bosom thus the far-fetch'd sigh? What grief afflicts the maid to friendship dear? Form'd with the power the coldest heart to warm, With innate beauty glowing in thy breast; What from thy bosom can contentment charm, Or break with momentary woe thy rest? Can she whose presence never fails to give New life, new joy, on whom she deigns to smile; Thus like a turtle solitary live, And all admirers of their hopes beguile?â âAlas my Mary! nought can e'er avail, To sooth the gathered tumults of my soul; Or, wakening comfort for a girl so frail, To calm my sorrows, or my griefs control. Not all the pleasures that this world affords, Can give one moment to my soul of peace; Nor all the flattering emptiness of words, Make glad this conscience with its wonted ease. Short are the joys triumphant beauty gives, With hurried steps full quick they flit away; E'en while the triumph in the bosom lives, We droop with night, and sicken with the day. But O my Mary! nought can e'er reprieve My soul from sorrow, or my bosom cheer; Or bless the heart, that fluttering to deceive, Has stretch'd my Edward on a watery bier. Pleased with the tho'ts of conquest, and of fame, I spurn'd the youth, forgetful of his love, Whose crimson blushes spoke the burning flameâ Hard was my heartânor sighs, nor tears, could move. At length, dejected with my base disdain, And worn with sorrow, and corroding care, He plunged, at midnight, in the billowy main, And left these fields, and left this vernal air. 'Twas then I found, nor pride, nor wealth, nor praise, Could pour one beam of comfort on my mind; Twas then I wish'd, that with an answering grace, I'd heard his vows, and never been unkind. Full many an eve I've dew'd the green-clad earth With stern Repentance' bitter-dropping tear; Full many a day I've fled the house of mirth, And brooded o'er the memory of my dear. Thus, thus, my Mary! torn from every joy, And pierced with Conscience' terrifying dart, In tears, and sighs, my moments I employ, Nor tears, nor sighs, can ease my broken heart.â Here as she paused, a sudden thunder shook The groves around; the darken'd forests roar; The trees that mantled o'er the winding brook, Scared at the sound, forsook the waved-wash'd shore. Terrific lightning blazing round their heads In one large sheet the wide-stretch'd forest veil'd; And new-form'd thunder shook again the meads, And chased the lightnings that their forms assail'd. At once a voice, stern as the winter's roar, That chill'd their vitals, and that froze their blood; Bade the loud grumbling thunder vex no more The trembling forest, and the frighten'd flood. At once a deeper flash o'erspread the sky: A louder peal convulsed the trembling ground; The lightnings vanish'd from the pain-fed eye; And thunders wavered with a distant sound. Sudden a form, with which the angelic host, Nor Raphael's self in majesty could vie, Chased the dark thunders from the quaking coast, And oped the purpling regions on their eye. Then, with a look that pierced thro' Laura's heart, And crop'd the withering roses of her cheekâ âThou wretchâ he cried, âno comfort I impart; No joys for thee the swift-wing'd minutes seek. He who, with tears, thy favors once implored Another holds by Hymen's sacred band; No more to wander from the nymph adored, No more to quit, for vile disdain, the land. Content shall bless him in the works of peace, Fame shall his footsteps in the war attend; Rend from a Cesar's brow the withering wreaths To deck the worthier temples of my friend. His wife, sweet partner of his every joy, Adorn'd with all the virtues of the fair, Shall bless his life in love without alloy, Love free from sorrow and perplexing care. In all her looks is sentiment express'd; In every action dignity and grace; O! form'd from every age new praise to wrestâ And scatter blushes o'er a Portia's face. She, tinged with health's inimitable dye, Shall pass the spring and summer of her life; Rise, with a nation's blessings, to the sky, Her only EpitaphââThis was a Wife.â But thou, shall sicken with the coming eve; Drop, unlamented, to the narrow grave; No grateful memory to thy kindred leave; No hand assist thee, none shall wish to save.â Again fresh lightnings sheeted o'er the skies; Again fresh thunders rock'd the trembling ground; The vision vanish'd from her eager eyes, And lightnings quivered at the parting sound. ELLA. ODE, WRITTEN ON LEAVING THE PLACE OF MY NATIVITY. See also J. Bringhurst in Landmark Anthologies. High up the heavens the Sun in radiance moves, Gilding thy varied beauties, happy Place, Whose charms, by birth and time endear'd, my spirit loves, And mourning leaves, a distant way to trace. Now let me check the rising sigh To mark, with melancholy eye, Thy scenes which, lingering, from my view retire: Thy domes, slow-moving from the sight; Thy Lake, which gleams a fainting light; Thy dim-discovered spire. Dear scenes of youthful joyâfarewel! Farewel the Street which evening hail'd her own, Charm'd with the scattered moonlight o'er it thrown, Listening, with sweet attention, while the knell Rung o'er the echoing fields, of Summer's early bell. Farewel the Street, where winter, robed in snow, Roar'd with wild tempest in the ear of night; Where Friendshpip, powerful, could his might o'erthrow, And win Affection's house of calm delight. Farewel thou venerable Dome, Where the mild Sabbath call'd my constant feet. Still let me think how frequent on thy seat, Deep-musing tho't hath found a heavenly home. For there the soul, when bigot rage was raised, And fiery zeal threw crimson o'er the face, Or when the vengeance of the Lord was praised, And torture shook the tenements of grace; Or priestly warmth upraised the rod; Or Dullness nodded o'er the word of God; Could look with mild complacency around; And aye where inborn worth was found, Or goodness glow'd upon the face of youth, Or native innocency shone, Or beauty soften'd on the lip of truth, Or dove-like Pureness fix'd her throne; Could gaze with fond delight, Grow better at the sight, Grateful would swell for what was given, And rise, in glowing rapture, up to heaven. To the still-winding River's moonlight banks; The slowly-rising Hill, which leads along To where the Grove, rich scene of Quips and Cranks And side-supporting laughter, becks the jocund throng; One pensive, last farewell, now loads my sorrowing song. Farewel dear Inmates of my soul! Now let no grief your minds controul; Now heave no silent, secret, sigh; Or hang in tears the mournful eye; Or lift the hands, in anguish wrung; Or wake to speech the flattering tongue. Is't not enough in pain to part? Spare, spare, the agonizing heart. Science hails me to her seat; Bright Ambition urges on; Fame to Glory tempts my feet. âSeize on knowledge ere 'tis gone. âLearning opes her varied stores; âAge his stream o' treasure pours; âMeek-eyed Piety requires; âMild Humanity desires; âPity points, thy gain, the skies; âCome!â the Voice of Nature cries. Father of Heaven! I bow with soul resign'd. My former joys shall aid my better part; All meaner cares be banish'd from my mind My toils my Country claims, and God my heart. ELLA. SONNET IX. To Mr. JOHN TRUMBULL. See also J. Bringhurst in Landmark Anthologies. Trumbull! to thee, with hesitating hand, I wake the tremulously-breathing lyre; Fearful that Age, altho the Muse inspire, Should weep that Modesty had lost command. Tis not, alone, that energy divine Lives o'er the canvass, as thy pencil moves: That tint perfects the exquisite design, And life is present; that my soul approves: But, that thy Spirit brooding o'er the immense Of unknown Beauty, to existence gave The plan, where Wisdom, Liberty, and Sense, The high-soul'd Patriot, and the Warrior brave, Live, with the appropriate character of face, In all the pencil's manners-painting grace. ELLA. ODE, TO BIRTHA. See also J. Bringhurst in Landmark Anthologies. With every changement of the varying mind New feelings animate the mortal frame; And new sensations of the body, claim A soul to equal sympathy inclined. See Malice on the face imprint A dimpled smile, the down-drawn lip that strains, Half bend the brow, and place the eye asquint, And shrink, with expectation, all the veins. See pale Consumption o'er the sage's soul Spread idiot weakness, infantine distress, Raise with false hope, with faithless joy controul, With fancied, groundless agony depress. While with invigorating health we tread, And Youth, with dewy fingers, binds Her crown of roses round the head, Borne on the winged winds, Imagination strays. Wherever Nature's hand her charms displaysâ Be it to see âthe rich-hair'd Youth of Mornâ Impearl the fragrance-breathing thorn; To see the mist wind slowly o'er the hill; Or hear, from unseen bank, loud burst the gurgling rill; Or Zephyr rustle sweet the woods among Whose thickets swell with melody and song; To hear the voice of Industry resound; The ploughman whistling o'er the loamy ridge; The shepherd's tinkling bell that talks around; And hoofs loud rattling o'er the village bridge; Or torrents foaming down the mountain's breast;â There doth imagination love to rest. But when the sallow hand of Sickness spreads Wan desolation o'er the human face, No more imagination loves to trace The sportive beauties of the laughing meads. But the drear cavern, and the dark some dell, The wild faint-gleaming with the meteor's light, The distant watch-tower's hollow-sounding bell, And tempests brooding o'er the inclement night; Blue, sulphur-breathing, flames, from church-yard paths that rise, Dim, shadowy forms, that dance before the sight, The quick-departing flash, that wraps the skies, And horror's scream, the melancholy soul delight. When deep disease hangs heavy on the mind, Such sympathetic grief the body feels, That he but half restores, who only heals The woe with which the anguish'd spirit pined: For health must give new vigor to the frame Ere soft Contentment can the bosom claim. So, if the hand of agony distress The suffering body with distracting pain, No earthly medicine can so well sustain, No costly cordial can so truly bless, As the calm soul, to providence resign'dâ The steady sunshine of the immortal mind. O then, my Birtha! from the scenes Where gloomy Contemplation loves to dwell, From musing Melancholy's cell, Your wounded spirit call, To where eternal love the soul serenes, And Heaven's own finger's âdress the dreary ball.â Read and reflect, reflect and read; Make it your constant study and employ, The grand, affecting, solemn, truths to heed, Which wake, of pious hearts, the moral joy. These as you study, torn from dreary views, New bliss shall animate your soul, New strength your body brace; With sweet delight the fancy trace The lighter paths of moral dues, And see contentment light the mental pole. By soft degrees, the scenes which former days On your imagination pictured fair, Shall rise, bedeck'd with joy-reviving rays, And from your bosom chase the monster Care. Then Happiness, with powerful arm, Shall wrest his poignard from Disease, And from the features that were born to please, Scatter, of felon Sickness, far the fallow charm: Again shall bid health sparkle from your eye; In every step bid laughing pleasure dance; Young Love the dimpling cheek with smiles enhance; And Youth, in glory bursting from the sky, With Beauty's rich, inimitable grace, Throw her celestial roses o'er your face. ELLA. A FRAGMENT. See also J. Bringhurst in Landmark Anthologies. The following little Poem was written as a testimony of the Author's respect for the talents of Mr. Ralph Earl, a Painter of the school of West, and one whom nothing but misfortune has hindered from making a conspicuous figure among the great artists in the profession of Painting. With steady hand, There Earl marks out the deep-expressive line. Fix'd o'er the work intent, the colours spreadâ Thro the thin white deep blushes now the red; And here the violet, mingling with the blue. Spreads loose in flowing folds of azure-thining hue. Refering to several Paintings by Mr. Earl. With form embodied, Force, and Vigour stand; And Eloquence extends the hand; And sober Tho't contracts his brow; And Sadness wipes the tears that flow In softly-sympathetic woe. Still at his touch new forms arise; The soul sits sparkling in the eyes; Speech opes the lips; the throbbing heart Seems thro the swelling breast to start: The turgid muscles aid the vivid strife, And all the form bursts trembling into life. The effect which the sight of them produces on different characters. Simplicity, with ardent gaze. Stands fix'd in deep amaze, And agitated Rapture lifts his trembling hands; Bent o'er the piece young Genius stands; While Tenderness, with tearful eye, Strives to suppress the rising sigh; And Superstition lifts the affrighted cry. ELLA. THE SMILE. SONNET TO CAROLINE. See also J. Bringhurst in Landmark Anthologies. Hast thou not seen upon some night serene, The silver moon with smiling radiance beamâ Illume the groveâenliven every streamâ And add new charms to every lovely scene? So charming Caroline thy angel-smile On day or night unequall'd joy bestows, Does the sad breast of grief and pain beguile, And stays the tear which else forever flows. In thy soft smile the soul of sweetness lives, That grace, which shines exalted over artâ Which speaks the friendly and the feeling heart, And ev'ry virtuous wish and transport gives. Then lovely Caroline thy smile repeat; I fear not there the poison of deceit. HENRY. A FRAGMENT, In imitation of Spenser. See also J. Bringhurst in Landmark Anthologies. Ah me! how black misfortune clouds the day! How joy is banish'd from the human mind! How pleasure flies at like the evening ray, Ne can we e'er its lovely footsteps find. And still unheedful, to the present blind, We let the joyous moments slip along: Still to ourselves eke careless and unkind, We pass e'er straying from the happy throng, Ne join the easy dance, ne sootly raise the song. Yet now, regardful of life's little space, And wisely yielding with obeisance still, Let me no more the pleasant scene deface With griefs responsive to the murm'ring rill, And moans loud echoing o'er the neigh'bring hill. O let me hide my sorrows in the night, And how submissive to the Eternal will; Then Time shall load each moment with delight, And o'er my soul shall shine the Muse's living light.â 'Twas when the Sun had climb'd the azure steep, And shed his yellow influence on the earth; Had driven the roaring tempests 'neath the deep, And call'd the green creation into birth; When lively Youth, gay Health and buxom Mirth, Scatter'd the Summer's joys the world around; When the neat housewife from her kitchen hearth Had thrown the ashes on the garden ground, And with green boughs and flowrets it had crown'd; Then, where Libanus which is hight the new New Lebanon springs, in the state of New-Yorkâcommonly called the Pool. Spreads all around its ever varied scene, And pours a rich creation on the view, Stray'd from mine home, in spritely youth I been, Then, with fresh joy I ken the smiling green, The distant mountains frowning on the vale, The lofty woods which shew their heights atween, The speckled flocks thick nibbling in the dale, And leaves, and flutt'ring birds, ay flying in the gale. Aid me, O Muse! the varied joys to tell Which in this region of delight appear; To mark the sorrows which must here ay dwell; The joys, and woes, which call the differing tear. What curious Nature hath ypighted here Ay torturing pain fore'er to drive away, And ease the grief of many tiresome yeare; Or to add comfort to the present day; Eke her unkindness joying kindly to o'erpay. These waters have proved a radical cure in many cases of rheumatism, and in scrophulous affections; and have relieved many other complaints. One singular case of their efficacy in Spasmodic diseases is daily exhibited there, and is worth relating. A Mr. Hitchcock, who keeps the Bath House, has lived there many years unable to remove. He appears perfectly well. Generally once a dayâsometimes less often, and sometimes oftener, he is seized with strong convulsions; his muscles appear to be drawn into knotsâwhich I have seen of the size of a large egg. In this situation, unable to support or assist himself, he is carried to the bath, stripped and rolled in. The effect is instantaneous. He immediately jumps up perfectly recovered; and is commonly free till nearly the same time next day. From the smooth plain we rise the craggy hill That tortuous windes its lengthened way along; Leave on the lest the hoarse ay clacking mill, And reach the dome, meet burthen of a song. The dome e'er swarming with the busy throng, That with a different purpose seek the place, In pleasure's paths to wander all among; Or dry the tear from sorrow's faded face, Which the soft hand of Love delights away to chase. Much company resort here in the months of July, August, September and October, for the purposes of pleasure, and recovering health. Straught from the morning to the falling ray, Full many a foot the building spred, I ween, And its front proudly to the southern day Uprearing pleasant, from afar was seen. Flank'd with a broad Piazza round it beenâ Meet place to walk, and spend the summer's morn; And from its edge to view the distant scene, When the sun, rising, all things doth adorn, And gild the flowers, and dew-drops glistening on the thorn. Here, when the orient blushes o'er the earth, I walk, regardful of the enchanting view. What charms the voice of Summer wakes to birth! What beauty trembleth through the lucent dew! Far round the horizon rise the mountains blue! In distant prospect mingling with the sky; And here the woods in varied foliage shew; Yielding soft pleasure to the roving eye, That longs the innumerous sweets of nature to descry. At distance still, and o'er a beauteous plain A village breaketh through the tufted trees: Where industry renews her daily pain, And labor sigheth on the careless breeze. Here, tho' rich plenty laugheth o'er the mees, In antic vesture robed Religion walks, Her face in sorrows drest, all hearts doth freeze, And with a frigid hand creation balks; While in her train wan Care, with Pain united, stalks. This refers to the sect called Shaking Quakers. About two miles from the Pool they have a handsome church; and a large house in which near an hundred persons live.âTheir devotion consists principally in dancing and singing. These exercises are carried on to their own extreme emaciation.âThey are very laborious, and have generally the character of scrupulous honesty.âThe women and men live in different parts of the same house; the married persons have no connection with each other, and all marriages are prohibited. Their dress is extremely simple. The men wear short coats and short hair. The women are, generally, dressed in a white short gown and skirt, and in small close long-eared caps.âThe sect seems to be rather diminishing, as the natural means of increase are cut off; few proselytes are gained; and the severity and constancy of their fatiguing exercises carries them off in a few yearsâThis denomination of religionists made its appearance about ten years since. The head of them was the former mistress of a British officer. She called herself the Elect Lady; and lived to see her principles adopted by a considerable number of people in the north part of the States of New-York and Massachusetts, and some parts of VermontâThey call themselves Christiansâbut their exact principles I am unacquainted with. Here, while the eye doth glisten with delight To see what pleasaunce liveth o'er the scene, Yet doth compassion's tear bedim the sight. O Heaven! shall Virtue of celestial mien The soul of nature, and creation's queen, Reign but to spread destruction on mankind? Shall Piety, bedeck'd in God's own sheen, Live but to seal damnation on the mindâ Whose very soul is love with adoration join'd? ELLA. SONG. See also J. Bringhurst in Landmark Anthologies. Away each soft and tender blissâ The laugh of joyâthe glance of loveâ The gay discourseâthe heart of peaceâ The hours, which winged with rapture, move. A friend, once wont to give and share Each transport of the fleeting year, A semblant angel, good and fair, To every thought and feeling dear; Explored my unsuspecting heart In smiling Friendship's faithless guise, Exulting found a tender part Where lives soft peace and where it dies. And thereâah there! her causeless hate Impressed an undeserved blow, That sealed with endless grief my fate, And plunged me deep in hopeless woe. Then trust not, Youth, the melting air, The thrilling touch, refined embrace; Since Treachery has a form so fair, And Malice wears so sweet a face. HENRY. ODE. THE FAR WELL. See also J. Bringhurst in Landmark Anthologies. Hope, holy sister of the cherub Peace! Thy path celestial thro' the heavens I trace. As now, reclining on the amber breast Of yon far-sailing cloud, Thou deign'st thy hallowed form to rest, Thy beauties half enshroud. Yet, tho' thy glories faintly fill the sight, Fair Queen I know thee, and adore thy might. Thy robes of snowy white I know; The golden lock that o'er thy shoulder strays, And on the skirting of the cloud doth throw The splendor of the solar blaze; Thy skyey mantle now I say. That, backward floating, on the breezes plays; The dim mists now thy visage fly, I meet the comfort of thine eye. Offspring of Virtue, Consolation's child! Thy power, thy kindness, and thy love, I bless; And with adoring heart thy care confess, Whose condescension mild, Hath spread new calmness o'er my Birtha's soul, Bid new-born transport' thro' her bosom stray, Their tides fresh spirits thro' her vessels roll, And sweet Contentment o'er her features play. Henceforth my idle song shall cease, No higher comforts can I give Than those which in her bosom live, Thy voice serene hath spoke, and all her soul is peace. âGo little Lyre, unbend thy useless chords, Untune each speaking string; No more my voice of youth shall give thee words, My feeble touch responsive bid thee ring. For now severer Study lifts her voice, And chides the lingering accents of my lay; Points to the waiting object of my choice, That shuddering trembles at each fond delay. Now cares await me, and the frugal toil That builds, of Competence the peaceful dome, And gives, at length, the happy haven home. Perchance, in days to come, may Leisure smile, And fond Remembrance give thee to my sight, Not all unused thy warblings to awake, Not unacquainted to arouse delight, To soothe the sad, the warm to love excite, And bid, with deepest dread, the soul severely shake. And then, perchance, in happiest union join'd, Thy chords, kind answering to my song, May pour some happy strain along, And please, of Wisdom's Sons, the taste refined. ELLA.</field>
