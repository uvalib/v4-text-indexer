      <field name="fulltext">This Book is Dedicated to Sara Teasdale, Poet INVOCATION FOR âTHE MAP OF THE UNIVERSEâ (Showing how none of the pictures are possible to draw and can only be indicated in diagrams and hieroglyphics) Would we were blind with Milton, and we sang With him of uttermost Heaven in a new song, That men might see again the angel-throng, And newborn hopes, true to this age, would rise, Pictures to make men weep for paradise, All glorious things beyond the defeated grave. God smite us blind, and give us bolder wings; God help us to be brave. TO EVE, MAN'S DREAM OF WIFEHOOD AS DESCRIBED BY MILTON Darling of Miltonâwhen that marble man Saw you in shadow, coming from God's hand Serene and young, did he not chant for you Praises more quaint than he could understand? âTo justify the ways of God to manââ So, self-deceived, his printed purpose runs. His love for you is the true key to him, And Uriel and Michael were your sons. Your bosom nurtured his Urania. Your meek voice, piercing through his midnight sleep Shook him far more than silver chariot wheels Or rattling shields, or trumpets of the deep. Titan and lover, could he be content With Eden's narrow setting for your spell? You wound soft arms around his brows. He smiled And grimly for your home built Heaven and Hell. That was his posy. A strange gift, indeed. We bring you what we can, not what is fit. Eve, dream of wifehood! Each man in his way Serves you with chants according to his wit. JOHNNY APPLESEED'S WIFE OF THE MIND Johnny Appleseed dreamed that because of his monastic self-immolation in the depths of the frontier forest, he would be rewarded in the next life with two very beautiful wives. I Come let us pray to the Lord of the sky For revelry, Fair revelry, For a marble porch on a threshold old Where the swan-white flowers of fantasy Poised in the twilight wondrously, Come to the eyes like songs to the breast, While we drink and we conquer gloriously The fountain springs of Alchemy, The watercups of the Sons of God In high Archangel Revelry. Friendship is that heavenly drink, Friendship builds those palaces; What have the angels more than thisâ Than friendship, in their chalices? Oh! God! For the crystal wine we call Forever strong as the water-fall, Forever cold as the snowbird's wing, Forever dear as the desert spring, Dearest above all; In a porch called âBeauty,â crumbling not, In the heaven all men have forgot, We will sing our praise in the heights of the sky With revelry, fair revelry. II The slender maiden found me sleeping, Stirred my breast by her wings and her singing, Lifted me to the place of feasting While the water-falls in the court were ringing. There we ate of the crust of knowledge, There we drank of the water of kindness. The cups were simple, formed of silver, Vermillion banners waved behind us. Her eyes were round with noble wonder, Deep her songs from her sweet throat throbbing; Wise her words and fine her laughter While the water-falls of the court were sobbing. The lamps were low when we turned all sated To view the streets in their moss-hung glory: The heaven jungles stretched before us, The nodding trees were weighed with story. I scarce dare say what the dark groves told us, Their whisperings of grim, dim sadness, Over rotted harps and rusted gold In the treasure-pits, and the bold lithe gladness Of the moon-vines cold on the ivory chariots. Of the ivy-vines round the fallen fountains Of the magic amaranthine flowers, Lighting the jungles and the mountains. We were alone; that, that was Heaven, And when she left me, not forlorn, But praising God, in my beggar's hutâ I watched the coming of the morn. JOHNNY APPLESEED'S HYMN TO THE SUN Christ the dew in the clod, Christ the sap of the trees, Christ the light in the waterfall, Christ the soul of the sun, Innermost blood of the sun, Grant I may touch the fringes Of the outermost robe of the sun; Let me store your rays till my ribs Carry the breath of lightning, Till my lips speak the fullness of thunder To waken world-weary men: Till my whisper engenders lions Out of the desert weeds. Give me your eyes, O sun, To watch through the universe Where other suns speed on, Brothers, children of God, Making the great deeps fair. Take me unto yourself. My flesh is a sacrifice, If only my soul may go As a flame to the edge of the sky Where the sin-born stars come forth From the black strong chaos-sea, From the infinite widths of widths of night. Grant I may die in a star As the chosen of God all die Rising again in the dreams Of sinning, star born men, Destroying their sins forever. Give me your hidden wings, That I may go to the heights Of the gold-built cliffs of heaven, Where jungles in silence reign. Where the streets, knee-deep in moss And the mansions heavy with trees With Cedars of Lebanon With olive and orange and palm Are silent but for the wind, Empty, mysterious. Give me your strength, O sun! Give me your hidden wings, Till I climb to the holiest place, That highest plain of all, With its glassy shallow pools, That desert of level fear Where three great thrones stand high Hewn from three ancient mountains, Blind thrones of a fair lost land. You have left your thrones for the suns, Great God, O Trinity, With all your marvelous hosts, Cherubim, seraphim. You blaze in our eyes by day. They gleam from the stars by night. Give us your life, O sun! Body and blood of Christ, Wafer of awful fire Give us the contrite heart, Take out the death from us. Either the dead are dead, Or to-day is eternity, Your face is eternity, Your rays are our endless life. You are girt with a golden girdle, You are with all your crucified Angels and saints and men Who die under clouds in the stars: You are bringing them back from the dead. They breathe on my face as I pray. Give me your innermost life. Come quickly, Alpha, Omega, Our God, the beginning and end! JOHNNY APPLESEED'S SHIP COMES IN This is the night my ship comes in. The wine comes pouring down. Glory and pain! The Angel's blood Anoints the teeming town. And the mighty flagship sways and dips, And I thank my God with fevered lips. My prophet brings a thousand ships And the dream of a thorny crown. He will lead these empty ships like sheep, He will sail the hills of air, He will find bold sailors, young as I Who will love the scars of careâ The care that comes with crimson hands, From pouring of the wine; The wine of angels crucified, The wine of demons crucified, Brothers of Christ, all crucified In the stars, and made divine. We will lead our fleets through newborn skies, We will scour each rebel worldâ Till every lonely deck shall see Strange prophet-scrolls uncurled Till every lonely mast shall see Strange prophet flags unfurledâ Till cataracts from the cups of God Upon the stars are whirled. JOHNNY APPLESEED SPEAKS OF THE APPLEBLOSSOM AMARANTH THAT WILL COME TO THIS CITY Now, in the night, all music haunts us here ... Is it for nothing heaven cracks and yawns And the tremendous amaranth descends, Loaded with glory of ten thousand dawns? The amaranth means:âGod would have us say:â âWhether you will or no, O city young, Heaven will bloom like one great flower for you: Flash and loom greatly, all your streets among.â Friend, I will not stop hoping, though you mourn. We see such flowers, and some of them shall come, Though now our streets are jazzed, or sadly grey, And though our boys are strident now, or dumb. Friend, that flower-town, that wonder town shall come, Naught can prevent it. Though it may not be What we may plan, it comes, at lastâwe know With streets like channels of an incense sea,â With twilight mists from heaven's jungles deep, Or where the butterfly's great soul Still floats asleepâ Beneath great heaven's granite steep;â It comes, at last we know, With musical bells, from the great western tree, From the far star, or golden maids that come From Eve's great eastern palace of the sky Where great golden wonders never die. JOHNNY APPLESEED'S WIFE FROM THE PALACE OF EVE (See Harper's Monthly Magazine for November, 1871) The crickets call through the long, long night And the clouds are grey and the wind goes down, And I wonder and wait in the moonlight white For the maid from the Chaos Town. ... For the maid from the Palace of Eve to come, Soul of my body, blood of my arms, By love made blind, by fear made dumb, A bride, with a bride's alarms: A girl with the bridal glory red From, her quivering face to her rosy feet, With her heaven-made bridal vows all said, And mine on earth complete. O Mother Eve in your deathless power, By Adam's throne in the crumbling years, Send her one murmuring perfect hour Of fear and passionate tears! Let her love be wild as a cataract, The storm you knew when the morning came; Or ever you felt the drouth of noon Or the drouth of sin or the drouth of shame. Make her of bread from out of your hand, Make her of honey from your board, Make her kiss like the lightning brand That shall pierce my soul as a sword: Her breath of songs from the east and west And every fragrant wind that blows; Her splendid knees from the lily's breast Her tender feet from the lips of the rose. Make her a sacrificial fire Where noble friendship shall be slain On the spice-flamed wood of dread desire, Stronger in glory and joy and pain. Make her blood of the grapes of delight, A cup of your shadowy garden-wine; Her breasts of the asphodel so white, Her face of the amaranth divine! The crickets call through the long, long night, And the clouds are grey and the wind goes down, And I wonder and wait in the moonlight white For the maid from the Chaos Town: From the Chaos Town in the furthest East Beyond the edge of the things that are, Built from the broken rock and mist Of many a dead titanic star. And the hours go on and on and on And my empty arms are iron and lead, And the skies are blue, for the dawn has gone, And I wait by a weary bed. JOHNNY APPLESEED SPEAKS OF GREAT CITIES IN THE FUTURE Incense and splendor haunt me as I go. Though my good works have been, alas, too few, Though I do nothing, high heaven comes down to me, And future ages pass in tall review. I see the years to come as armies vast, Stalking tremendous through the fields of time. Man is unborn. To-morrow he is born, Flame-like to hover over moil and grime, Striving, aspiring till the shame is gone, Sowing a million flowers where now we mournâ Laying new, precious pavements with a song, Founding new shrines the good streets to adorn. I have seen lovers by those new-built walls Clothed like the dawn in orange, gold and red. Eyes flashing forth the glory-light of love Under the wreath that crowned each royal head. Life was made greater by their sweetheart prayers. Passion was turned to civic strength that dayâ Piling the marbles, making fairer domes With zeal that else had burned bright youth away: I have seen priestesses of life go by Gliding in samite through the incense-seaâ Innocent children marching with them there, Singing in flowered robes, âThe earth is freeâ: While on the fair, deep-carved unfinished towers Sentinels watched in armor, night and dayâ Guarding the brazier fires of hope and dreamâ Wild was their peace, and dawn-bright their array! And scattering dreams, and glory, Prophets' boats sailed in from far away, And angels' boats sailed in From chaos-seas and many a stormy bay. HOW JOHNNY APPLESEED WALKED ALONE IN THE JUNGLES OF HEAVEN Oh, once I walked in Heaven, all alone Upon the sacred cliffs above the sky. God and the angels and the gleaming saints Had journeyed out into the stars to die. They had gone forth to win far citizens, Bought at great price, bring happiness for all: By such a harvest make a holier town And put new life within old Zion's wall. Each chose a far-off planet for his home, Speaking of love and mercy, truth and right, Envied and cursed, thorn-crowned and scourged in time, Each tested death on his appointed night. Then, Resurrection Day from sphere to sphere Sped on, with all the Powers arisen again, While with them came in clouds recruited hosts Of sun-born strangers and of earth-born men. And on that day gray prophet saints went down And poured atoning blood upon the deep, Till every warrior of old Hell flew free And all the torture fires were laid asleep. And Hell's lost company I saw return Clear-eyed, with plumes of white, the demons bold Climbed with the angels now on Jacob's stair, And built a better Zion than the old. And yet I walked alone on azure cliffs A lifetime long, and loved each untrimmed vine: The rotted harps, the swords of rusted gold, The jungles of all Heaven then were mine. Oh mesas and throne-mountains that I found! Oh strange and shaking thoughts that touched me there, Ere I beheld the bright returning wings That came to spoil my secret, silent lair! PARVENU Where does Cinderella sleep? By Heaven's jungle-river, A secret place her burning Prince Decks, while his heart-strings quiver. Homesick for our cinder world, Her low-born shoulders shiver; She longs for sleep in cinders curledâ We, for the jungle-river. COLLECTED POEMS SECTION I NIGHTINGALES THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE A Song in Chinese Tapestries âHow, how,â he said, âFriend Chang,â I said, âSan Francisco sleeps as the deadâ Ended license, lust and play: Why do you iron the night away? Your big clock speaks with a deadly sound, With a tick and a wail till dawn comes round. While the monster shadows glower and creep, What can be better for man than sleep?â âI will tell you a secret,â Chang replied; âMy breast with vision is satisfied, And I see green trees and fluttering wings, And my deathless bird from Shanghai sings.â Then he lit five firecrackers in a pan. âPop, pop,â said the firecrackers, âcra-cra-crack.â He lit a joss stick long and black. Then the proud gray joss in the corner stirred; On his wrist appeared a gray small bird, And this was the song of the gray small bird: âWhere is the princess, loved forever, Who made Chang first of the kings of men?â And the joss in the corner stirred again; And the carved dog, curled in his arms, awoke, Barked forth a smoke-cloud that whirled and broke. It piled in a maze round the ironing-place, And there on the snowy table wide Stood a Chinese lady of high degree, With a scornful, witching, tea-rose face. ... Yet she put away all form and pride, And laid her glimmering veil aside With a childlike smile for Chang and for me. The walls fell back, night was aflower, The table gleamed in a moonlit bower, While Chang, with a countenance carved of stone, Ironed and ironed, all alone. And thus she sang to the busy man Chang: âHave you forgotten ... Deep in the ages, long, long ago, I was your sweetheart, there on the sandâ Storm-worn beach of the Chinese land? We sold our grain in the peacock townâ Built on the edge of the sea-sands brownâ Built on the edge of the sea-sands brown. ... When all the world was drinking blood From the skulls of men and bulls And all the world had swords and clubs of stone, We drank our tea in China beneath the sacred spice-trees, And heard the curled waves of the harbor moan. And this gray bird, in Love's first spring, With a bright-bronze breast and a bronze-brown wing, Captured the world with his carolling. Do you remember, ages after, At last the world we were born to own? You were the heir of the yellow throneâ The world was the field of the Chinese man And we were the pride of the Sons of Han? We copied deep books and we carved in jade, And wove blue silks in the mulberry shade. ...â âI remember, I remember That Spring came on forever, That Spring came on forever,â Said the Chinese nightingale. My heart was filled with marvel and dream, Though I saw the western street-lamps gleam, Though dawn was bringing the western day, Though Chang was a laundryman ironing away. ... Mingled there with the streets and alleys, The railroad-yard and the clock-tower bright, Demon clouds crossed ancient valleys; Across wide lotus-ponds of light I marked a giant firefly's flight. And the lady, rosy-red, Flourished her fan, her shimmering fan, Stretched her hand toward Chang, and said: âDo you remember, Ages after, Our palace of heart-red stone? Do you remember The little doll-faced children With their lanterns full of moon-fire, That came from all the empire Honoring the throne?â The loveliest fÃªte and carnival Our world had ever known? The sages sat about us With their heads bowed in their beards, With proper meditation on the sight. Confucius was not born; We lived in those great days Confucius later said were lived aright. ... And this gray bird, on that day of spring, With a bright-bronze breast, and a bronze-brown wing, Captured the world with his carolling. Late at night his tune was spent. Peasants, Sages, Children, Homeward went, And then the bronze bird sang for you and me. We walked alone. Our hearts were high and free. I had a silvery name, I had a silvery name, I had a silvery nameâdo you remember The name you cried beside the tumbling sea?â Chang turned not to the lady slimâ He bent to his work, ironing away; But she was arch, and knowing and glowing, For the bird on his shoulder spoke for him. âDarling ... darling ... darling ... darling ...â Said the Chinese nightingale. The great gray joss on the rustic shelf, Rakish and shrewd, with his collar awry, Sang impolitely, as though by himself, Drowning with his bellowing the nightingale's cry: âBack through a hundred, hundred years Hear the waves as they climb the piers, Hear the howl of the silver seas, Hear the thunder. Hear the gongs of holy China How the waves and tunes combine In a rhythmic clashing wonder, Incantation old and fine: âDragons, dragons, Chinese dragons, Red firecrackers, and green firecrackers And dragons, dragons, Chinese dragons.ââ Then the lady, rosy-red, Turned to her lover Chang and said: âDare you forget that turquoise dawn When we stood in our mist-hung velvet lawn, And worked a spell this great joss taught Till a God of the Dragons was charmed and caught? From the flag high over our palace home He flew to our feet in rainbow-foamâ A king of beauty and tempest and thunder Panting to tear our sorrows asunder. A dragon of fair adventure and wonder. We mounted the back of that royal slave With thoughts of desire that were noble and grave. We swam down the shore to the dragon-mountains, We whirled to the peaks and the fiery fountains. To our secret ivory house we were borne. We looked down the wonderful wing-filled regions Where the dragons darted in glimmering legions. Right by my breast the nightingale sang; The old rhymes rang in the sunlit mist That we this hour regainâ Song-fire for the brain. When my hands and my hair and my feet you kissed, When you cried for your heart's new pain, What was my name in the dragon-mist, In the rings of rainbowed rain?â âSorrow and love, glory and love,â Said the Chinese nightingale. âSorrow and love, glory and love,â Said the Chinese nightingale. And now the joss broke in with his song: âDying ember, bird of Chang, Soul of Chang, do you remember?â Ere you returned to the shining harbor There were pirates by ten thousand Descended on the town In vessels mountain-high and red and brown, Moon-ships that climbed the storms and cut the skies. On their prows were painted terrible bright eyes. But I was then a wizard and a scholar and a priest; I stood upon the sand; With lifted hand I looked upon them And sunk their vessels with my wizard eyes, And the stately lacquer-gate made safe again. Deep, deep below the bay, the seaweed and the spray, Embalmed in amber every pirate lies, Embalmed in amber every pirate lies.â Then this did the noble lady say: âBird, do you dream of our home-coming day When you flew like a courier on before From the dragon-peak to our palace-door, And we drove the steed in your singing pathâ The ramping dragon of laughter and wrath: And found our city all aglow, And knighted this joss that decked it so? There were golden fishes in the purple river And silver fishes and rainbow fishes. There were golden junks in the laughing river, And silver junks and rainbow junks: There were golden lilies by the bay and river, And silver lilies and tiger-lilies, And tinkling wind-bells in the gardens of the town By the black-lacquer gate Where walked in state The kind king Chang And his sweetheart mate. ... With his flag-born dragon And his crown of pearl ... and ... jade, And his nightingale reigning in the mulberry shade, And sailors and soldiers on the sea-sands brown, And priests who bowed them down to your songâ By the city called Han, the peacock town, By the city called Han, the nightingale town, The nightingale town.â Then sang the bird, so strangely gay, Fluttering, fluttering, ghostly and gray, A vague, unravelling, final tune, Like a long unwinding silk cocoon; Sang as though for the soul of him Who ironed away in that bower dim:â âI have forgotten Your dragons great, Merry and mad and friendly and bold. Dim is your proud lost palace-gate. I vaguely know There were heroes of old, Troubles more than the heart could hold, There were wolves in the woods Yet lambs in the fold, Nests in the top of the almond tree. ... The evergreen tree ... and the mulberry tree ... Life and hurry and joy forgotten, Years on years I but half-remember ... Man is a torch, then ashes soon, May and June, then dead December, Dead December, then again June. Who shall end my dream's confusion? Life is a loom, weaving illusion ... I remember, I remember There were ghostly veils and laces ... In the shadowy bowery places ... With lovers' ardent faces Bending to one another, Speaking each his part. They infinitely echo In the red cave of my heart. âSweetheart, sweetheart, sweetheart,â They said to one another. They spoke, I think, of perils past. They spoke, I think, of peace at last. One thing I remember: Spring came on forever, Spring came on forever,â Said the Chinese nightingale. SHANTUNG, OR THE EMPIRE OF CHINA IS CRUMBLING DOWN (Dedicated to William Rose BenÃ©t) âConfucius appeared, according to Mencius, one of his most distinguished followers, at a crisis in the nation's history. âThe world,â he says, âhad fallen into decay, and right principles had disappeared. Perverse discourses and oppressive deeds were waxen rife. Ministers murdered their rulers, and sons their fathers. Confucius was frightened by what he saw,âand he undertook the work of reformation.â âHe was a native of the state of Lu, a part of the modern Shantung. ... Lu had a great name among the other states of Chow ... etc.â Rev. James Legge, Professor of Chinese, University of Oxford. I have found the poem Shantung an especial favorite with the audience when I have been called upon to recite for the staff of some public library. I Now let the generations passâ Like sand through Heaven's blue hour-glass. In old Shantung, By the capital where poetry began, Near the only printing presses known to man, Young Confucius walks the shore On a sorrowful day. The town, all books, is tumbling down Through the blue bay. The bookworms writhe From rusty musty walls. They drown themselves like rabbits in the sea. Venomous foreigners harry mandarins With pitchfork, blunderbuss and snickersnee. In the book-slums there is thunder; Gunpowder, that sad wonder, Intoxicates the knights and beggar-men. The old grotesques of war begin again: Rebels, devils, fairies are set free. So ... Confucius hears a carol and a hum: A picture sea-child whirs from off his fan In one quick breath of peach-bloom fantasy. Then, in an instant bows the reverent kneeâ A full-grown sweetheart, chanting his renown. And then she darts into the Yellow Sea, Calling, calling: âSage with holy brow, Say farewell to China now; Live like the swine, Leave off your scholar-gown! This city of books is falling, falling, The Empire of China is crumbling down.â II Confucius, Confucius, how great was Confuciusâ The sage of Shantung, and the master of Mencius? Alexander fights the East. Just as the Indus turns him back He hears of tempting lands beyond, With sword-swept cities on the rack With crowns outshining India's crown: The Empire of China, crumbling down. Later the Roman sibyls say: âEgypt, Persia and Macedon, Tyre and Carthage, passed away: And the Empire of China is crumbling down. Rome will never crumble down.â III See how the generations passâ Like sand through Heaven's blue hour-glass. Arthur waits on the British shore One thankful day, For Galahad sails back at last To Camelot Bay. The pure knight lands and tells the tale: âFar in the east A sea-girl led us to a king, The king to a feast, In a land where poppies bloom for miles, Where books are made like bricks and tiles. I taught that king to love your nameâ Brother and Christian he became. âHis Town of Thunder-Powder keeps A giant hound that never sleeps, A crocodile that sits and weeps. âHis Town of Cheese the mouse affrights With fire-winged cats that light the nights. They glorify the land of rust; Their sneeze is music in the dust. (And deep and ancient is the dust.) âAll towns have one same miracle With the Town of Silk, the capitalâ Vast bookworms in the book-built walls. Their creeping shakes the silver halls; They look like cables, and they seem Like writhing roots on trees of dream. Their sticky cobwebs cross the street, Catching scholars by the feet, Who own the tribes, yet rule them not, Bitten by bookworms till they rot. Beggars and clowns rebel in might Bitten by bookworms till they fight.â Arthur calls to his knights in rows: âI will go if Merlin goes; These rebels must be flayed and sliced, Let us cut their throats for Christ.â But Merlin whispers in his beard: âChina has witches to be feared.â Arthur stares at the sea-foam's rim Amazed. The fan-girl beckons him!â That slender and peculiar child Mongolian and brown and wild. His eyes grow wide, his senses drown, She laughs in her wing, like the sleeve of a gown. She lifts a key of crimson stone. âThe Great Gunpowder-town you own.â She lifts a key with chains and rings: âI give the town where cats have wings.â She lifts a key as white as milk: âThis unlocks the Town of Silkââ Throws forty keys at Arthur's feet: âThese unlock the land complete.â Then, frightened by suspicious knights, And Merlin's eyes like altar-lights, And the Christian towers of Arthur's town, She spreads blue finsâshe whirs away; Fleeing far across the bay, Wailing through the gorgeous day: âMy sick king begs That you save his crown And his learned chiefs from the worm and clownâ The Empire of China is crumbling down.â IV Always the generations pass, Like sand through Heaven's blue hour-glass! The time the King of Rome is bornâ Napoleon's son, that eaglet thingâ Bonaparte finds beside his throne One evening, laughing in her wing, The Chinese sea-child; and she cries, Breaking his heart with emerald eyes And fairy-bred unearthly grace: âMaster, take your destined placeâ Across white foam and water blue The streets of China call to you: The Empire of China is crumbling down.â Then he bends to kiss her mouth, And gets but incense, dust and drouth. Custodians, custodians! Mongols and Manchurians! Christians, wolves, Mohammedans! In hard Berlin they cried: âO King, China's way is a shameful thing!â In Tokio they cry: âO King, China's way is a shameful thing!â And thus our song might call the roll Of every land from pole to pole, And every rumor known to time Of China dodderingâor sublime. V Slowly the generations passâ Like sand through Heaven's blue hour-glass. So let us find tomorrow now: Our towns are gone; Our books have passed; ten thousand years Have thundered on. The Sphinx looks far across the world In fury black: She sees all western nations spent Or on the rack. Eastward she sees one land she knew When from the stone Priests of the sunrise carved her out And left her lone. She sees the shore Confucius walked On his sorrowful day: Impudent foreigners rioting, In the ancient way; Officials, futile as of old, Have gowns more bright; Bookworms are fiercer than of old, Their skins more white; Dust is deeper than of old, More bats are flying; More songs are written than of oldâ More songs are dying. Where Galahad found forty towns Now fade and glare Ten thousand towns with book-tiled roof And garden-stair, Where beggars' babies come like showers Of classic words: They rule the worldâimmortal brooks And magic birds. The lion Sphinx roars at the sun: âI hate this nursing you have done! The meek inherit the earth too longâ When will the world belong to the strong?â She soars; she claws his patient faceâ The girl-moon screams at the disgrace. The sun's blood fills the western sky; He hurries not, and will not die. The baffled Sphinx, on granite wings, Turns now to where young China sings. One thousand of ten thousand towns Go down before her silent wrath; Yet even lion-gods may faint And die upon their brilliant path. She sees the Chinese children romp In dust that she must breathe and eat. Her tongue is reddened by its lye; She craves its grit, its cold and heat. The Dust of Ages holds a glint Of fire from the foundation-stones, Of spangles from the sun's bright face, Of sapphires from earth's marrow-bones. Mad-drunk with it, she ends her dayâ Slips when a high sea-wall gives way, Drowns in the cold Confucian sea Where the whirring fan-girl first flew free. In the light of the maxims of Chesterfield, Mencius, Wilson, Roosevelt, Tolstoy, Trotsky, Franklin or Nietzsche, how great was Confucius? âLaughing Asiaâ brown and wild, That lyric and immortal child, His fan's gay daughter, crowned with sand, Between the water and the land Now cries on high in irony, With a voice of night-wind alchemy: âO cat, O Sphinx, O stony-face, The joke is on Egyptian pride, The joke is on the human race: âThe meek inherit the earth too longâ When will the world belong to the strong?â I am born from off the holy fan Of the world's most patient gentleman. So answer me, O courteous sea! O deathless sea!â And thus will the answering Ocean call: China will fall, The Empire of China will crumble down, When the Alps and the Andes crumble down; When the sun and the moon have crumbled down, The Empire of China will crumble down, Crumble down.â THE SPICE-TREE This is the song The spice-tree sings: âHunger and fire, Hunger and fire, Sky-born Beautyâ Spice of desire.â Under the spice-tree Watch and wait, Burning maidens And lads that mate. The spice-tree spreads And its boughs come down Shadowing village and farm and town. And none can see But the pure of heart The great green leaves And the boughs descending, And hear the song that is never ending. The deep roots whisper, The branches say:â âLove tomorrow, And love today, And till Heaven's day, And till Heaven's day.â The moon is a bird's nest in its branches, The moon is hung in its topmost spaces. And there, tonight, two doves play house While lovers watch with uplifted faces. Two doves go home To their nest, the moon. It is woven of twigs of broken light, With threads of scarlet and threads of gray And a lining of down for silk delight. To their Eden, the moon, fly home our doves, Up through the boughs of the great spice-tree;â And one is the kiss I took from you, And one is the kiss you gave to me. I KNOW ALL THIS WHEN GIPSY FIDDLES CRY Oh, gipsies, proud and stiff-necked and perverse, Saying: âWe tell the fortunes of the nations, And revel in the deep palm of the world. The head-line is the road we choose for trade. The love-line is the lane wherein we camp. The life-line is the road we wander on. Mount Venus, Jupiter, and all the rest Are finger-tips of ranges clasping round And holding up the Romany's wide sky.â Oh, gipsies, proud and stiff-necked and perverse, Saying: âWe will swap horses till the doom, And mend the pots and kettles of mankind, And lend our sons to big-time vaudeville, Or to the race-track, or the learned world. But India's Brahma waits within their breasts. They will return to us with gipsy grins, And chatter Romany, and shake their curls And hug the dirtiest babies in the camp. They will return to the moving pillar of smoke, The whitest toothed, the merriest laughers known, The blackest haired of all the tribes of men. What trap can hold such cats? The Romany Has crossed such delicate palms with lead or gold, Wheedling in sun and rain, through perilous years, All coins now look alike. The palm is all. Our greasy pack of cards is still the book Most read of men. The heart's librarians, We tell all lovers what they want to know. So, out of the famed Chicago Library, Out of the great Chicago orchestras, Out of the skyscraper, the Fine Arts Building, Our sons will come with fiddles and with loot, Dressed, as of old, like turkey-cocks and zebras, Like tiger-lilies and chameleons, Go west with us to California, Telling the fortunes of the bleeding world, And kiss the sunset, ere their day is done.â Oh, gipsies, proud and stiff-necked and perverse Picking the brains and pockets of mankind, You will go westward for one-half hour yet. You will turn eastward in a little while. You will go back, as men turn to Kentucky, Land of their fathers, dark and bloody ground. When all the Jews go home to Syria, When Chinese cooks go back to Canton, China, When Japanese photographers return With their black cameras to Tokio, And Irish patriots to Donegal, And Scotch accountants back to Edinburgh, You will go back to India, whence you came. When you have reached the borders of your quest, Homesick at last, by many a devious way, Winding the wonderlands circuitous, By foot and horse will trace the long way back! Fiddling for ocean liners, while the dance Sweeps through the decks, your brown tribes all will go! Those east-bound ships will hear your long farewell On fiddle, piccolo, and flute and timbrel. I know all this, when gipsy fiddles cry. That hour of their homesickness, I myself Will turn, will say farewell to Illinois, To old Kentucky and Virginia, And go with them to India, whence they came. For they have heard a singing from the Ganges, And cries of orioles,âfrom the temple caves,â And Bengal's oldest, humblest villages. They smell the supper smokes of Amritsar. Green monkeys cry in Sanskrit to their souls From lofty bamboo trees of hot Madras. They think of towns to ease their feverish eyes, And make them stand and meditate forever, Domes of astonishment, to heal the mind. I know all this, when gipsy fiddles cry. What music will be blended with the wind When gipsy fiddlers, nearing that old land, Bring tunes from all the world to Brahma's house? Passing the Indus, winding poisonous forests, Blowing soft flutes at scandalous temple girls, Filling the highways with their magpie loot What brass from my Chicago will they heap, What gems from Walla Walla, Omaha, Will they pile near the Bodhi Tree, and laugh? They will dance near such temples as best suit them Though they will not quite enter, or adore, Looking on roofs, as poets look on lilies, Looking at towers, as boys at forest vines, That leap to tree-tops through the dizzy air. I know all this, when gipsy fiddles cry. And with the gipsies there will be a king And a thousand desperadoes just his style, With all their rags dyed in the blood of roses, Splashed with the blood of angels, and of demons. And he will boss them with an awful voice. And with a red whip he will beat his wife. He will be wicked on that sacred shore, And rattle cruel spurs against the rocks, And shake Calcutta's walls with circus bugles. He will kill Brahmins there, in Kali's name, And please the thugs, and blood-drunk of the earth. I know all this, when gipsy fiddles cry. Oh, sweating thieves, and hard-boiled scalawags, That still will boast your pride until the doom, Smashing every caste rule of the world, Reaching at last your Hindu goal to smash The caste rules of old India, and shout: âDown with the Brahmins, let the Romany reign.â When gipsy girls look deep within my hand They always speak so tenderly and say That I am one of those star-crossed to wed A princess in a forest fairy-tale. So there will be a tender gipsy princess, My Juliet, shining through this clan. And I would sing you of her beauty now. And I will fight with knives the gipsy man Who tries to steal her wild young heart away. And I will kiss her in the waterfalls, And at the rainbow's end, and in the incense That curls about the feet of sleeping gods, And sing with her in canebrakes and in rice fields, In Romany, eternal Romany. We will sow secret herbs, and plant old roses, And fumble through dark, snaky palaces, Stable our ponies in the Taj Mahal, And sleep outdoors ourselves. In her strange fairy mill-wheel eyes will wait All windings and unwindings of the highways, From India, across America,â All windings and unwindings of my fancy, All windings and unwindings of all souls, All windings and unwindings of the heavens. I know all this, when gipsy fiddles cry. We gipsies, proud and stiff-necked and perverse, Standing upon the white Himalayas, Will think of far divine Yosemite. We will heal Hindu hermits there with oil Brought from California's tall sequoias. And we will be like gods that heap the thunders, And start young redwood trees on Time's own mountains, We will swap horses with the rising moon, And mend that funny skillet called Orion, Color the stars like San Francisco's street-lights, And paint our sign and signature on high In planets like a bed of crimson pansies; While a million fiddles shake all listening hearts, Crying good fortune to the Universe, Whispering adventure to the Ganges waves, And to the spirits, and all winds and gods. Till mighty Brahma puts his golden palm Within the gipsy king's great striped tent, And asks his fortune told by that great love-line That winds across his palm in splendid flame. Only the hearthstone of old India Will end the endless march of gipsy feet. I will go back to India with them When they go back to India whence they came. I know all this, when gipsy fiddles cry. A RHYME FOR ALL ZIONISTS The Eyes of Queen Esther, and How They Conquered King Ahasuerus âEsther had not showed her people nor her kindred.â I He harried lions up the peaks. In blood and moss and snow they died. He wore a cloak of lions' manes To satisfy his curious pride. Men saw it, trimmed with emerald bands, Flash on the crested battle-tide. Where Bagdad stands, he hunted kings, Burned them alive, his soul to cool. Yet in his veins god Ormazd wrought To make a just man of a fool. He spoke the rigid truth, and rode, And drew the bow, by Persian rule. II Ahasuerus in his prime Was gracious and voluptuous. He saw a pale face turn to him, A gleam of Heaven's righteousness: A girl with hair of David's gold And Rachel's face of loveliness. He dropped his sword, he bowed his head. She led his steps to courtesy. He took her for his white north star: A wedding of true majesty. Oh, what a war for gentleness Was in her bridal fantasy! Why did he fall by candlelight And press his bull-heart to her feet? He found them as the mountain-snow Where lions died. Her hands were sweet As ice upon a blood-burnt mouth, As mead to reapers in the wheat. The little nation in her soul Bloomed in her girl's prophetic face. She named it not, and yet he felt One challenge: her eternal race. This was the mystery of her step, Her trembling body's sacred grace. He stood, a priest, a Nazarite, A rabbi reading by a tomb. The hardy raider saw and feared Her white knees in the palace gloom, Her pouting breasts and locks well combed Within the humming, reeling room. Her name was Meditation there: Fair opposite of bullock's brawn. I sing her eyes that conquered him. He bent before his little fawn, Her dewy fern, her bitter weed, Her secret forest's floor and lawn. He gave his towers and towns to her. She hated them, and turned not back. Her eyes kept hunting through his soul As one may seek through battle black For one dear banner held on high, For one bright bugle in the rack. The scorn that loves the sexless stars: Traditions passionless and bright: The ten commands (to him unknown), The pillar of the fire by night:â Flashed from her alabaster crown The while they kissed by candlelight. The rarest psalms of David came From her dropped veil (odd dreams to him). It prophesied, he knew not how, Against his endless armies grim. He saw his Shushan in the dustâ Far in the ages growing dim. Then came a glance of steely blue, Flash of her body's silver sword. Her eyes of law and temple prayer Broke him who spoiled the temple hoard. The thief who fouled all little lands Went mad before her, and adored. The girl was Eve in Paradise, Yet Judith, till her war was won. All of the future tyrants fell In this one king, ere night was done, And Israel, captive then as now Ruled with tomorrow's rising sun. And in the logic of the skies He who keeps Israel in his hand, The God whose hope for joy on earth The Gentile yet shall understand, Through powers like Esther's steadfast eyes Shall free each little tribe and land. These verses were written for the Phi Beta Kappa Society of Philadelphia and read at their meeting, December 8, 1917. INCENSE Think not that incense-smoke has had its day. My friends, the incense-time has but begun. Creed upon creed, cult upon cult shall bloom, Shrine after shrine grow gray beneath the sun. And mountain-boulders in our aged West Shall guard the graves of hermits truth-endowed: And there the scholar from the Chinese hills Shall do deep honor, with his wise head bowed. And on our old, old plains some muddy stream, Dark as the Ganges, shall, like that strange tideâ (Whispering mystery to half the earth)â Gather the praying millions to its side, And flow past halls with statues in white stone To saints unborn today, whose lives of grace Shall make one shining, universal church Where all Faiths kneel, as brothers, in one place. A NET TO SNARE THE MOONLIGHT (What the Man of Faith Said) The dew, the rain and moonlight All prove our Father's mind. The dew, the rain and moonlight Descend to bless mankind. Come, let us see that all men Have land to catch the rain, Have grass to snare the spheres of dew, And fields spread for the grain. Yea, we would give to each poor man Ripe wheat and poppies red,â A peaceful place at evening With the stars just overhead: A net to snare the moonlight, A sod spread to the sun, A place of toil by daytime, Of dreams when toil is done. ABRAHAM LINCOLN WALKS AT MIDNIGHT (In Springfield, Illinois) It is portentous, and a thing of state That here at midnight, in our little town A mourning figure walks, and will not rest, Near the old court-house pacing up and down, Or by his homestead, or in shadowed yards He lingers where his children used to play, Or through the market, on the well-worn stones He stalks until the dawn-stars burn away. A bronzed, lank man! His suit of ancient black, A famous high top-hat and plain worn shawl Make him the quaint great figure that men love, The prairie-lawyer, master of us all. He cannot sleep upon his hillside now. He is among us:âas in times before! And we who toss and lie awake for long Breathe deep, and start, to see him pass the door. His head is bowed. He thinks on men and kings. Yea, when the sick world cries, how can he sleep? Too many peasants fight, they know not why, Too many homesteads in black terror weep. The sins of all the war-lords burn his heart. He sees the dreadnaughts scouring every main. He carries on his shawl-wrapped shoulders now The bitterness, the folly and the pain. He cannot rest until a spirit-dawn Shall come;âthe shining hope of Europe free: The league of sober folk, the Workers' Earth, Bringing long peace to Cornland, Alp and Sea. It breaks his heart that kings must murder still, That all his hours of travail here for men Seem yet in vain. And who will bring white peace That he may sleep upon his hill again? NIAGARA I Within the town of Buffalo Are prosy men with leaden eyes. Like ants they worry to and fro (Important men, in Buffalo). But only twenty miles away A deathless glory is at play: Niagara, Niagara. The women buy their lace and cry:â âO such a delicate design,â And over ostrich feathers sigh, By counters there, in Buffalo. The children haunt the trinket shops, They buy false-faces, bells, and tops, Forgetting great Niagara. Within the town of Buffalo Are stores with garnets, sapphires, pearls, Rubies, emeralds aglow,â Opal chains in Buffalo, Cherished symbols of success. They value not your rainbow dress:â Niagara, Niagara. The shaggy meaning of her name This Buffalo, this recreant town, Sharps and lawyers prune and tame; Few pioneers in Buffalo; Except young lovers flushed and fleet And winds hallooing down the street: âNiagara, Niagara.â The journalists are sick of ink: Boy prodigals are lost in wine, By night where white and red lights blink, The eyes of Death, in Buffalo. And only twenty miles away Are starlit rocks and healing spray:â Niagara, Niagara. Above the town a tiny bird, A shining speck at sleepy dawn, Forgets the ant-hill so absurd, This self-important Buffalo. Descending twenty miles away He bathes his wings at break of dayâ Niagara, Niagara. II What marching men of Buffalo Flood the streets in rash crusade? Fools-to-free-the-world, they go, Primeval hearts from Buffalo. Red cataracts of France today Awake, three thousand miles away An echo of Niagara, The cataract Niagara. MAE MARSH, MOTION PICTURE ACTRESS (In âMan's Genesis,â âThe Wild Girl of the Sierras,â âThe Wharf Rat,â âA Girl of the Paris Streets,â etc.) I The arts are old, old as the stones From which man carved the sphinx austere. Deep are the days the old arts bring: Ten thousand years of yesteryear. II She is madonna in an art As wild and young as her sweet eyes: A frail dew flower from this hot lamp That is today's divine surprise. Despite raw lights and gloating mobs She is not seared: a picture still: Rare silk the fine director's hand May weave for magic if he will. When ancient films have crumbled like Papyrus rolls of Egypt's day, Let the dust speak: âHer pride was high, All but the artist hid away: âKin to the myriad artist clan Since time began, whose work is dear.â The deep new ages come with her, Tomorrow's years of yesteryear. EPITAPHS FOR TWO PLAYERS I. Edwin Booth (An old actor at the Players' Club told me that Edwin Booth first impersonated Hamlet when a barnstormer in California. There were few theatres but the hotels were provided with crude assembly rooms for strolling players.) The youth played in the blear hotel. The rafters gleamed with glories strange. And winds of mourning Elsinore Howling at chance and fate and change; Voices of old Europe's dead Disturbed the new-built cattle-shed, The street, the high and solemn range. The while the coyote barked afar All shadowy was the battlement. The ranch-boys huddled and grew pale, Youths who had come on riot bent. Forgot were pranks well-planned to sting. Behold there rose a ghostly king, And veils of smoking Hell were rent. When Edwin Booth played Hamlet, then The camp-drab's tears could not but flow. Then Romance lived and breathed and burned. She felt the frail queen-mother's woe, Thrilled for Ophelia, fond and blind, And Hamlet, cruel, yet so kind, And moaned, his proud words hurt her so. A haunted place, though new and harsh! The Indian and the Chinaman And Mexican were fain to learn What had subdued the Saxon clan. Why did they mumble, brood, and stare When the court-players curtsied fair And the Gonzago scene began? And ah, the duel scene at last! They cheered their prince with stamping feet. A death-fight in a palace! Yea, With velvet hangings incomplete, A pasteboard throne, a pasteboard crown, And yet a monarch tumbled down, A brave lad fought in splendor meet. Was it a palace or a barn? Immortal as the gods he flamed. There, in his last great hour of rage, His foil avenged a mother shamed. In duty stern, in purpose deep He drove that king to his black sleep And died, all godlike and untamed. I was not born in that far day. I hear the tale from heads grown white. And then I walk that earlier street, The mining camp at candlelight. I meet him wrapped in musings fine Upon some whispering silvery line He yet resolves to speak aright. II. Epitaph for John Bunny, Motion-Picture Comedian (In which he is remembered in similitude, by reference to Yorick, the king's jester, who died when Hamlet and Ophelia were children) Yorick is dead. Boy Hamlet walks forlorn Beneath the battlements of Elsinore. Where are those oddities and capers now That used to âset the table on a roarâ? And do his bauble-bells beyond the clouds Ring out, and shake with mirth the planets bright? No doubt he brings the blessed dead good cheer, But silence broods on Elsinore tonight. That little elf, Ophelia, eight years old, Upon her battered doll's staunch bosom weeps. (âO best of men, that wove glad fairy-tales.â) With tear-burned face, at last the darling sleeps. Hamlet himself could not give cheer or help, Though firm and brave, with his boy-face controlled. For every game they started out to play Yorick invented, in the days of old. The times are out of joint! O cursed spite! The noble jester Yorick comes no more. And Hamlet hides his tears in boyish pride By some lone turret-stair of Elsinore. HAMLET (Remembering how Walker Whiteside played Hamlet in Chatterton's Old Opera House, thirty years ago) Horatio took me to the cliff Upon the edge of things And said: âBehold a cataract Of the thrones of old dream kings.â And I saw the thrones falling From the high stars to the deep: Red thrones, green thrones, To everlasting sleep. I saw crowns falling From the zenith to the pit: Crowns of man's mighty moods And whims of little wit. And all the birds of Elsinore Flew round Horatio's head And crying said:â âThough all the crowns go down, Hamlet, Hamlet, will never lose his crown.â Oh, monarchs muddled, stabbed and lost, Who have no more to say: Gone with Caesar, with the Czar, And the Kaiser on his way! But now I see a student-prince More real than all such kings, Hamlet, home from Wittenberg, And every bird sings:â âThough all the crowns go down, Hamlet, Hamlet, will never lose his crown.â Some of the dreams we saw dethroned Were merely hopes of mine:â One that a child might love me, And give one leaf for a sign; One dream I had in babyhood That my rag-doll was alive; One that I had in boyhood That a sparrow, caged, would thrive. One that I had for years and years That my church held no disgrace. One that I had but yesterday:â Faith in Wisdom's face. Oh, royal crowns, falling fast From the days of boy's delight The frost-bright time when first I made A giant snow-man white. And the time of my first Christmas tree, My first Thanksgiving Day, My first loud Independence dawn When the cannon blazed away. ... Oh, high fantastic hours That died like dog and clown, Into the awful pit We saw their crowns go down, But Hamlet, Hamlet, will never lose his crown. As sages walk with sages On the proud Socratic way, Hamlet struts with players Till the world's last day. With seeming shameless strollers He swaggers his black cloak, With a prince's glittering eye. He spoils the townsmen's joke. As I watch him and attend him He compels them to give room, And makes Fifth Street our battlement Against the shades of doom. With poetry, authority, With every known pride Hamlet stands with drawn sword, His Gypsies at his side. And all the gardens of the town Are but Ophelia's flowers, And all the shades of Elsinore Fly round our Springfield towers; And Hamlet kneels by all the hearts That truly bleed or bloom, As saints do stations of the cross To Christ's white tomb. And all the birds keep singing To my heart bowed down: âHamlet, Hamlet, will never lose his crown.â SPRINGFIELD MAGICAL In this, the City of my Discontent, Sometimes there comes a whisper from the grass, âRomance, Romanceâis here. No Hindu town Is quite so strange. No Citadel of Brass By Sinbad found, held half such love and hate; No picture-palace in a picture-book Such webs of Friendship, Beauty, Greed and Fate!â In this, the City of my Discontent, Down from the sky, up from the smoking deep Wild legends new and old burn round my bed While trees and grass and men are wrapped in sleep. Angels come down, with Christmas in their hearts, Gentle, whimsical, laughing, heaven-sent; And, for a day, fair Peace have given me In this, the City of my Discontent! HOW A LITTLE GIRL SANG (Written for Mary Tiffany) Ah, she was music in herself, A symphony of joyousness. She sang, she sang from finger tips, From every tremble of her dress. I saw sweet haunting harmony, An ecstasy, an ecstasy, In that strange curling of her lips, That happy curling of her lips. And quivering with melody Those eyes I saw, that tossing head. And so I saw what music was, Tho' still accursed with ears of lead. HOW A LITTLE GIRL DANCED (Dedicated to Lucy Bates) (Being a reminiscence of certain private theatricals) Oh, cabaret dancer, I know a dancer, Whose eyes have not looked on the feasts that are vain. I know a dancer, I know a dancer, Whose soul has no bond with the beasts of the plain: Judith the dancer, Judith the dancer, With foot like the snow, and with step like the rain. Oh, thrice-painted dancer, vaudeville dancer, Sad in your spangles, with soul all astrain, I know a dancer, I know a dancer, Whose laughter and weeping are spiritual gain, A pure-hearted, high-hearted maiden evangel, With strength the dark cynical earth to disdain. Flowers of bright Broadway, you of the chorus, Who sing in the hope of forgetting your pain: I turn to a sister of Sainted Cecilia, A white bird escaping the earth's tangled skein:â The music of God is her innermost brooding, The whispering angels her footsteps sustain. Oh, proud Russian dancer: praise for your dancing. No clean human passion my rhyme would arraign. You dance for Apollo with noble devotion, A high cleansing revel to make the heart sane. But Judith the dancer prays to a spirit More white than Apollo and all of his train. I know a dancer who finds the true Godhead, Who bends o'er a brazier in Heaven's clear plain. I know a dancer, I know a dancer, Who lifts us toward peace, from this earth that is vain: Judith the dancer, Judith the dancer, With foot like the snow, and with step like the rain. FOR ALL WHO EVER SENT LACE VALENTINES The little-boy lover And little-girl lover Met the first time At the house of a friend. And great the respect Of the little-boy lover. The awe and the fear of her Stayed to the end. The little girl chattered, Incessantly chattered, Hardly would look When he tried to be nice. But deeply she trembled The little girl lover, Eaten with flame While she tried to be ice. The lion of loving, The terrible lion, Woke in the two Long before they could wed. The world said: âChild hearts You must keep till the summer. It is not allowed That your hearts should be red.â If only a wizard, A kindly gray wizard, Had built them a house In a cave underground. With an emerald door, And honey to eat! But it seemed that no wizard Was waiting around, But it seemed that no wizard Was waiting around. The rarest of notions, The rarest of passions And hopes here below! Many a child, His young heart too timid Has fled from his princess No other to know. I have seen them with faces Like books out of Heaven, With messages there The harsh world should read, The lions and roses and lilies of love, Its tender, mystic, tyrannical need. Were I god of the village My servants should mate them. Were I priest of the church I would set them apart. If the wide state were mine It should live for such darlings, And hedge with all shelter The child-wedded heart. THE MOON'S THE NORTH WIND'S COOKY (What the Little Girl Said) The Moon's the North Wind's cooky. He bites it, day by day, Until there's but a rim of scraps That crumble all away. The South Wind is a baker. He kneads clouds in his den, And bakes a crisp new moon that ... greedy North ... Wind ... eats ... again! THE LITTLE TURTLE (A Recitation for Martha Wakefield, Three Years Old) There was a little turtle. He lived in a box. He swam in a puddle. He climbed on the rocks. He snapped at a mosquito. He snapped at a flea. He snapped at a minnow. And he snapped at me. He caught the mosquito. He caught the flea. He caught the minnow. But he didn't catch me. YET GENTLE WILL THE GRIFFIN BE (What Grandpa Told the Children) The moon? It is a griffin's egg, Hatching to-morrow night. And how the little boys will watch With shouting and delight To see him break the shell and stretch And creep across the sky. The boys will laugh. The little girls, I fear, may hide and cry. Yet gentle will the griffin be, Most decorous and fat, And walk up to the Milky Way And lap it like a cat. THE SUN SAYS HIS PRAYERS âThe sun says his prayers,â said the fairy, Or else he would wither and die. âThe sun says his prayers,â said the fairy, âFor strength to climb up through the sky. He leans on invisible angels, And Faith is his prop and his rod. The sky is his crystal cathedral. And dawn is his altar to God.â THE SHIELD OF FAITH The full moon is the Shield of Faith: As long as it shall rise, I know that Mystery comes again, That Wonder never dies. I know that Shadow has its place, That Noon is not our goal, That Heaven has non-official hours To soothe and mend the soul; That witchcraft can be angel-craft And wizard deeds sublime; That utmost darkness bears a flower, Though long the budding-time. LOVE AND LAW True Love is founded in rocks of Remembrance In stones of Forbearance and mortar of Pain. The workman lays wearily granite on granite, And bleeds for his castle 'mid sunshine and rain. Love is not velvet, not all of it velvet, Not all of it banners, not gold-leaf alone. 'Tis stern as the ages and old as Religion. With Patience its watchword, and Law for its throne. THE LEADEN-EYED Let not young souls be smothered out before They do quaint deeds and fully flaunt their pride. It is the world's one crime its babes grow dull, Its poor are ox-like, limp and leaden-eyed. Not that they starve, but starve so dreamlessly, Not that they sow, but that they seldom reap, Not that they serve, but have no gods to serve, Not that they die but that they die like sheep. THE TRAVELLER-HEART (To a Man who maintained that the Mausoleum is the Stateliest Possible Manner of Interment) I would be one with the dark, dark earth:â Follow the plow with a yokel tread. I would be part of the Indian corn, Walking the rows with the plumes o'erhead. I would be one with the lavish earth, Eating the bee-stung apples red: Walking where lambs walk on the hills; By oak-grove paths to the pools be led. I would be one with the dark-bright night When sparkling skies and the lightning wedâ Walking on with the vicious wind By roads whence even the dogs have fled. I would be one with the sacred earth On to the end, till I sleep with the dead. Terror shall put no spears through me. Peace shall jewel my shroud instead. I shall be one with all pit-black things Finding their lowering threat unsaid: Stars for my pillow there in the gloom,â Oak-roots arching about my head! Stars, like daisies, shall rise through the earth, Acorns fall round my breast that bled. Children shall weave there a flowery chain, Squirrels on acorn-hearts be fed:â Fruit of the traveller-heart of me, Fruit of my harvest-songs long sped: Sweet with the life of my sunburned days, When the sheaves were ripe, and the apples red. A GOSPEL OF BEAUTY I recited these three poems more than any others in my mendicant preaching tour through the West. Taken as a triad, they hold in solution my theory of American civilization. I. The Proud Farmer (In memory of E. S. Frazee, Rush County, Indiana) Into the acres of the newborn state He poured his strength, and plowed his ancient name, And, when the traders followed him, he stood Towering above their furtive souls and tame. That brow without a stain, that fearless eye Oft left the passing stranger wondering To find such knighthood in the sprawling land, To see a democrat well-nigh a king. He lived with liberal hand, with guests from far, With talk and joke and fellowship to spare,â Watching the wide world's life from sun to sun, Lining his walls with books from everywhere. He read by night, he built his world by day. The farm and house of God to him were one. For forty years he preached and plowed and wroughtâ A statesman in the fields, who bent to none. His plowmen-neighbors were as lords to him. His was an ironside, democratic pride. He served a rigid Christ, but served him wellâ And, for a lifetime, saved the countryside. Here lie the dead, who gave the church their best Under his fiery preaching of the word. They sleep with him beneath the ragged grass ... The village withers, by his voice unstirred. And tho' his tribe be scattered to the wind From the Atlantic to the China Sea, Yet do they think of that bright lamp he burned Of family worth and proud integrity. And many a sturdy grandchild hears his name In reverence spoken, till he feels akin To all the lion-eyed who build the worldâ And lion-dreams begin to burn within. II. The Illinois Village O you who lose the art of hope, Whose temples seem to shrine a lie, Whose sidewalks are but stones of fear, Who weep that Liberty must die, Turn to the little prairie towns, Your higher hope shall yet begin. On every side awaits you there Some gate where glory enters in. Yet when I see the flocks of girls, Watching the Sunday train go thro' (As tho' the whole wide world went by) With eyes that long to travel too, I sigh, despite my soul made glad By cloudy dresses and brown hair, Sigh for the sweet life wrenched and torn By thundering commerce, fierce and bare. Nymphs of the wheat these girls should be: Kings of the grove, their lovers, strong. Why are they not inspired, aflame? This beauty calls for valiant songâ For men to carve these fairy-forms And faces in a fountain-frieze; Dancers that own immortal hours; Painters that work upon their knees; Maids, lovers, friends, so deep in life, So deep in love and poet's deeds, The railroad is a thing disowned, The city but a field of weeds. Who can pass a village church By night in these clean prairie lands Without a touch of Spirit-power? So white and fixed and cool it standsâ A thing from some strange fairy-town, A pious amaranthine flower, Unsullied by the winds, as pure As jade or marble, wrought this hour: Rural in form, foursquare and plain, And yet our sister, the new moon, Makes it a praying wizard's dream. The trees that watch at dusty noon Breaking its sharpest lines, veil not The whiteness it reflects from God, Flashing like Spring on many an eye, Making clean flesh, that once was clod. Who can pass a district school Without the hope that there may wait Some baby-heart the books shall flame With zeal to make his playmates great, To make the whole wide village gleam A strangely carved celestial gem, Eternal in its beauty-light, The Artist's town of Bethlehem! III. On the Building of Springfield Let not our town be large, remembering That little Athens was the Muses' home, That Oxford rules the heart of London still, That Florence gave the Renaissance to Rome. Record it for the grandson of your sonâ A city is not builded in a day: Our little town cannot complete her soul Till countless generations pass away. Now let each child be joined as to a church To her perpetual hopes, each man ordained: Let every street be made a reverent aisle Where Music grows and Beauty is unchained. Let Science and Machinery and Trade Be slaves of her, and make her all in all, Building against our blatant, restless time An unseen, skilful, medieval wall. Let every citizen be rich toward God. Let Christ the beggar, teach divinity. Let no man rule who holds his money dear. Let this, our city, be our luxury. We should build parks that students from afar Would choose to starve in, rather than go home, Fair little squares, with Phidian ornament, Food for the spirit, milk and honeycomb. Songs shall be sung by us in that good day, Songs we have written, blood within the rhyme Beating, as when Old England still was glad,â The purple, rich Elizabethan time. Say, is my prophecy too fair and far? I only know, unless her faith be high, The soul of this, our Nineveh, is doomed, Our little Babylon will surely die. Some city on the breast of Illinois No wiser and no better at the start By faith shall rise redeemed, by faith shall rise Bearing the western glory in her heart. The genius of the Maple, Elm and Oak, The secret hidden in each grain of corn, The glory that the prairie angels sing At night when sons of Life and Love are born, Born but to struggle, squalid and alone, Broken and wandering in their early years. When will they make our dusty streets their goal, Within our attics hide their sacred tears? When will they start our vulgar blood athrill With living language, words that set us free? When will they make a path of beauty clear Between our riches and our liberty? We must have many Lincoln-hearted men. A city is not builded in a day. And they must do their work, and come and go, While countless generations pass away. THE FLUTE OF THE LONELY (To the tune of âGaily the Troubadourâ) Faintly the ne'er-do-well Breathed through his flute: All the tired neighbor-folk, Hearing, were mute. In their neat doorways sat, Labors all done, Helpless, relaxed, o'er-wrought, Evening begun. None of them there beguiled Work-thoughts away, Like to this reckless, wild Loafer by day. (Weeds in his flowers upgrown! Fences awry! Rubbish and bottles heaped! Yard like a sty!) There in his lonely door, Leering and lean, Staggering, liquor-stained, Outlawed, obsceneâ Played he his moonlight thought, Mastered his flute. All the tired neighbor-folk, Hearing, were mute. None but he, in that block, Knew such a tune. All loved the strain, and all Looked at the moon! THE BRONCHO THAT WOULD NOT BE BROKEN A little coltâbroncho, loaned to the farm To be broken in time without fury or harm, Yet black crows flew past you, shouting alarm, Calling âBeware,â with lugubrious singing ... The butterflies there in the bush were romancing, The smell of the grass caught your soul in a trance, So why be a-fearing the spurs and the traces, O broncho that would not be broken of dancing? You were born with the pride of the lords great and olden Who danced, through the ages, in corridors golden. In all the wide farm-place the person most human. You spoke out so plainly with squealing and capering, With whinnying, snorting contorting and prancing, As you dodged your pursuers, looking askance, With Greek-footed figures, and Parthenon paces, O broncho that would not be broken of dancing. The grasshoppers cheered. âKeep whirling,â they said. The insolent sparrows called from the shed âIf men will not laugh, make them wish they were dead.â But arch were your thoughts, all malice displacing, Though the horse-killers came, with snake-whips advancing. You bantered and cantered away your last chance. And they scourged you, with Hell in their speech and their faces, O broncho that would not be broken of dancing. âNobody cares for you,â rattled the crows, As you dragged the whole reaper, next day, down the rows. The three mules held back, yet you danced on your toes. You pulled like a racer, and kept the mules chasing. You tangled the harness with bright eyes side-glancing, While the drunk driver bled youâa pole for a lanceâ And the giant mules bit at youâkeeping their places. O broncho that would not be broken of dancing. In that last afternoon your boyish heart broke. The hot wind came down like a sledge-hammer stroke. The blood-sucking flies to a rare feast awoke. And they searched out your wounds, your death-warrant tracing. And the merciful men, their religion enhancing, Stopped the red reaper, to give you a chance. Then you died on the prairie, and scorned all disgraces, O broncho that would not be broken of dancing. Souvenir of Great Bend, Kansas. THE GHOST OF THE BUFFALOES Last night at black midnight I woke with a cry, The windows were shaking, there was thunder on high, The floor was atremble, the door was ajar, White fires, crimson fires, shone from afar. I rushed to the dooryard. The city was gone. My home was a hut without orchard or lawn. It was mud-smear and logs near a whispering stream, Nothing else built by man could I see in my dream ... Then ... Ghost-kings came headlong, row upon row, Gods of the Indians, torches aglow. They mounted the bear and the elk and the deer, And eagles gigantic, aged and sere, They rode long-horn cattle, they cried âA-la-la.â They lifted the knife, the bow, and the spear, They lifted ghost-torches from dead fires below, The midnight made grand with the cry âA-la-la.â The midnight made grand with a red-god charge, A red-god show, A red-god show, âA-la-la, a-la-la, a-la-la, a-la-la.â With bodies like bronze, and terrible eyes Came the rank and the file, with catamount cries, Gibbering, yipping, with hollow-skull clacks, Riding white bronchos with skeleton backs, Scalp-hunters, beaded and spangled and bad, Naked and lustful and foaming and mad, Flashing primeval demoniac scorn, Blood-thirst and pomp amid darkness reborn, Power and glory that sleep in the grass While the winds and the snows and the great rains pass. They crossed the gray river, thousands abreast, They rode in infinite lines to the west, Tide upon tide of strange fury and foam, Spirits and wraiths, the blue was their home, The sky was their goal where the star-flags were furled, And on past those far golden splendors they whirled. They burned to dim meteors, lost in the deep. And I turned in dazed wonder, thinking of sleep. And the wind crept by Alone, unkempt, unsatisfied, The wind cried and criedâ Muttered of massacres long past, Buffaloes in shambles vast ... An owl said: âHark, what is a-wing?â I heard a cricket carolling, I heard a cricket carolling, I heard a cricket carolling. Then ... Snuffing the lightning that crashed from on high Rose royal old buffaloes, row upon row. The lords of the prairie came galloping by. And I cried in my heart âA-la-la, a-la-la, A red-god show, A red-god show, A-la-la, a-la-la, a-la-la, a-la-la.â Buffaloes, buffaloes, thousands abreast, A scourge and amazement, they swept to the west. With black bobbing noses, with red rolling tongues, Coughing forth steam from their leather-wrapped lungs, Cows with their calves, bulls big and vain, Goring the laggards, shaking the mane, Stamping flint feet, flashing moon eyes. Pompous and owlish, shaggy and wise. Like sea-cliffs and caves resounded their ranks With shoulders like waves, and undulant flanks. Tide upon tide of strange fury and foam, Spirits and wraiths, the blue was their home, The sky was their goal where the star-flags are furled, And on past those far golden splendors they whirled. They burned to dim meteors, lost in the deep, And I turned in dazed wonder, thinking of sleep. I heard a cricket's cymbals play, A scarecrow lightly flapped his rags, And a pan that hung by his shoulder rang, Rattled and thumped in a listless way, And now the wind in the chimney sang, The wind in the chimney, The wind in the chimney, The wind in the chimney, Seemed to say:â âDream, boy, dream, If you anywise can. To dream is the work Of beast or man. Life is the west-going dream-storms' breath, Life is a dream, the sigh of the skies, The breath of the stars, that nod on their pillows With their golden hair mussed over their eyes.â The locust played on his musical wing, Sang to his mate of love's delight. I heard the whippoorwill's soft fret. I heard a cricket carolling, I heard a cricket carolling, I heard a cricket say: âGood-night, good-night, Good-night, good-night, ... good-night.â IN PRAISE OF JOHNNY APPLESEED The best account of John Chapman's career, under the name âJohnny Appleseed,â is to be found in Harper's Monthly Magazine, November, 1871. (Born 1775; died 1847) I. Over the Appalachian Barricade In the days of President Washington, To be read like old leaves on the elm tree of Time, Sifting soft winds with sentence and rhyme. The glory of the nations, Dust and ashes, Snow and sleet, And hay and oats and wheat, Blew west, Crossed the Appalachians, Found the glades of rotting leaves, the soft deer-pastures, The farms of the far-off future In the forest. Colts jumped the fence, Snorting, ramping, snapping, sniffing, With gastronomic calculations, Crossed the Appalachians, The east walls of our citadel, And turned to gold-horned unicorns, Feasting in the dim, volunteer farms of the forest. Stripedest, kickingest kittens escaped, Caterwauling âYankee Doodle Dandy.â Renounced their poor relations, Crossed the Appalachians, And turned to tiny tigers In the humorous forest. Chickens escaped From farmyard congregations, Crossed the Appalachians, And turned to amber trumpets On the ramparts of our Hoosiers' nest and citadel, Millennial heralds Of the foggy mazy forest. Pigs broke loose, scrambled west, Scorned their loathsome stations, Crossed the Appalachians, Turned to roaming, foaming wild boars Of the forest. The smallest, blindest puppies toddled west While their eyes were coming open, And, with misty observations, Crossed the Appalachians, Barked, barked, barked At the glow-worms and the marsh lights and the lightning-bugs, And turned to ravening wolves Of the forest. Crazy parrots and canaries flew west, Drunk on May-time revelations, Crossed the Appalachians, And turned to delirious, flower-dressed fairies Of the lazy forest. Haughtiest swans and peacocks swept west, And, despite soft derivations, Crossed the Appalachians, And turned to blazing warrior souls Of the forest, Singing the ways Of the Ancient of Days. And the âOld Continentals In their ragged regimentals,â With bard's imaginations, Crossed the Appalachians. And A boy Blew west, And with prayers and incantations, And with âYankee Doodle Dandy,â Crossed the Appalachians, And was âyoung John Chapman,â Then âJohnny Appleseed, Johnny Appleseed,â Chief of the fastnesses, dappled and vast, In a pack on his back, In a deer-hide sack, The beautiful orchards of the past, The ghosts of all the forests and the grovesâ In that pack on his back, In that talisman sack, To-morrow's peaches, pears, and cherries, To-morrow's grapes and red raspberries, Seeds and tree-souls, precious things, Feathered with microscopic wings, All the outdoors the child heart knows, And the apple, green, red, and white, Sun of his day and his nightâ The apple allied to the thorn, Child of the rose. Porches untrod of forest houses All before him, all day long, âYankee Doodleâ his marching song; And the evening breeze Joined his psalms of praise As he sang the ways Of the Ancient of Days. Leaving behind august Virginia, Proud Massachusetts, and proud Maine, Planting the trees that would march and train On, in his name to the great Pacific, Like Birnam wood to Dunsinane, Johnny Appleseed swept on, Every shackle gone, Loving every sloshy brake, Loving every skunk and snake, Loving every leathery weed, Johnny Appleseed, Johnny Appleseed, Master and ruler of the unicorn-ramping forest, The tiger-mewing forest, The rooster-trumpeting, boar-foaming, wolf-ravening forest, The spirit-haunted, fairy-enchanted forest, Stupendous and endless, Searching its perilous ways In the name of the Ancient of Days. II. The Indians Worship Him, but He Hurries On Painted kings in the midst of the clearing Heard him asking his friends the eagles To guard each planted seed and seedling. Then he was a god, to the red man's dreaming; Then the chiefs brought treasures grotesque and fair,â Magical trinkets and pipes and guns, Beads and furs from their medicine-lair,â Stuck holy feathers in his hair. Hailed him with austere delight. The orchard god was their guest through the night. While the late snow blew from bleak Lake Erie, Scourging rock and river and reed, All night long they made great medicine For Jonathan Chapman, Johnny Appleseed, Johnny Appleseed; And as though his heart were a wind-blown wheat-sheaf, As though his heart were a new built nest, As though their heaven house were his breast, In swept the snowbirds singing glory. And I hear his bird heart beat its story, Hear yet how the ghost of the forest shivers, Hear yet the cry of the gray, old orchards, Dim and decaying by the rivers, And the timid wings of the bird-ghosts beating, And the ghosts of the tom-toms beating, beating. But he left their wigwams and their love. While you read, hear the hoof-beats of deer in the snow. And see, by their track, bleeding footprints we know. By the hour of dawn he was proud and stark, Kissed the Indian babes with a sigh, Went forth to live on roots and bark, Sleep in the trees, while the years howled by. Calling the catamounts by name, And buffalo bulls no hand could tame. Slaying never a living creature, Joining the birds in every game, With the gorgeous turkey gobblers mocking, With the lean-necked eagles boxing and shouting; Sticking their feathers in his hair,â Turkey feathers, Eagle feathers, Trading hearts with all beasts and weathers He swept on, winged and wonder-crested, Bare-armed, barefooted, and bare-breasted. The maples, shedding their spinning seeds, While you read, see conventions of deer go by. The bucks toss their horns, the fuzzy fawns fly. Called to his appleseeds in the ground, Vast chestnut-trees, with their butterfly nations, Called to his seeds without a sound. And the chipmunk turned a âsummerset.â And the foxes danced the Virginia reel; Hawthorne and crab-thorn bent, rain-wet, And dropped their flowers in his night-black hair; And the soft fawns stopped for his perorations; And his black eyes shone through the forest-gleam, And he plunged young hands into new-turned earth, And prayed dear orchard boughs into birth; And he ran with the rabbit and slept with the stream, And he ran with the rabbit and slept with the stream, And he ran with the rabbit and slept with the stream. And so for us he made great medicine, And so for us he made great medicine, And so for us he made great medicine. In the days of President Washington. III. Johnny Appleseed's Old Age Long, long after, When settlers put up beam and rafter, They asked of the birds: âWho gave this fruit? Who watched this fence till the seeds took root? Who gave these boughs?â They asked the sky, And there was no reply. To be read like faint hoof-beats of fawns long gone From respectable pasture, and park and lawn, And heartbeats of fawns that are coming again When the forest, once more, is the master of men. But the robin might have said, âTo the farthest West he has followed the sun, His life and his empire just begun.â Self-scourged, like a monk, with a throne for wages, Stripped, like the iron-souled Hindu sages, Draped like a statue, in strings like a scarecrow, His helmet-hat an old tin pan, But worn in the love of the heart of man, More sane than the helm of Tamerlane! Hairy Ainu, wild man of Borneo, Robinson CrusoeâJohnny Appleseed! And the robin might have said, âSowing, he goes to the far, new West, With the apple, the sun of his burning breastâ The apple allied to the thorn, Child of the rose.â Washington buried in Virginia, Jackson buried in Tennessee, Young Lincoln, brooding in Illinois, And Johnny Appleseed, priestly and free, Knotted and gnarled, past seventy years, Still planted on in the woods alone. Ohio and young Indianaâ These were his wide altar-stone, Where still he burnt out flesh and bone. Twenty days ahead of the Indian, twenty years ahead of the white man, At last the Indian overtook him, at last the Indian hurried past him; At last the white man overtook him, at last the white man hurried past him; At last his own trees overtook him, at last his own trees hurried past him. Many cats were tame again, Many ponies tame again, Many pigs were tame again, Many canaries tame again; And the real frontier was his sunburnt breast. From the fiery core of that apple, the earth, Sprang apple-amaranths divine. Love's orchards climbed to the heavens of the West. And snowed the earthly sod with flowers. Farm hands from the terraces of the blest Danced on the mists with their ladies fine; And Johnny Appleseed laughed with his dreams, And swam once more the ice-cold streams. And the doves of the spirit swept through the hours, With doom-calls, love-calls, death-calls, dream-calls; And Johnny Appleseed, all that year, Lifted his hands to the farm-filled sky, To the apple-harvesters busy on high; And so once more his youth began, And so for us he made great medicineâ Johnny Appleseed, medicine-man. Then The sun was their turned-up broken barrel, Out of which their juicy apples rolled, Down the repeated terraces, Thumping across the gold, An angel in each apple that touched the forest mold, A ballot-box in each apple, A state capital in each apple, Great high schools, great colleges, All America in each apple, Each red, rich, round, and bouncing moon That touched the forest mold. Like scrolls and rolled-up flags of silk, He saw the fruits unfold, And all our expectations in one wild-flower written dream. Confusion, and death-sweetness, and a thicket of crab-thorns! Heart of a hundred midnights, heart of the merciful morns. Heaven's boughs bent down with their alchemy, Perfumed airs, and thoughts of wonder. And the dew on the grass and his own cold tears Were one in brooding mystery, Though death's loud thunder came upon him, Though death's loud thunder struck him downâ The boughs and the proud thoughts swept through the thunder, Till he saw our wide nation, each State a flower, Each petal a park for holy feet, With wild fawns merry on every street, With wild fawns merry on every street, The vista of ten thousand years, flower-lighted and complete. Hear the lazy weeds murmuring, bays and rivers whispering, From Michigan to Texas, California to Maine; Listen to the eagles screaming, calling, âJohnny Appleseed, Johnny Appleseed,â There by the doors of old Fort Wayne. In the four-poster bed Johnny Appleseed built, Autumn rains were the curtains, autumn leaves were the quilt. He laid him down sweetly, and slept through the night, Like a stone washed white, There by the doors of old Fort Wayne. THE STATUE OF OLD ANDREW JACKSON When the statue of Andrew Jackson before the White House in Washington is removed, America is doomed. The nobler days of America's innocence, in which it was set up, always have a special tang for those who are tasty. But this is not all. It is only the America that has the courage of her complete past that can hold up her head in the world of the artists, priests and sages. It is for us to put the iron dog and deer back upon the lawn, the John Rogers group back into the parlor, and get new inspiration from these and from Andrew Jackson ramping in bronze replica in New Orleans, Nashville and Washington, and add to them a sense of humor, till it becomes a sense of beauty that will resist the merely dulcet and affettuoso. Please read Lorado Taft's History of American Sculpture, pages 123â127, with these matters in mind. I quote a few bits: â... The maker of the first equestrian statue in the history of American sculpture: Clark Mills. ... Never having seen General Jackson or an equestrian statue, he felt himself incompetent ... the incident, however, made an impression on his mind, and he reflected sufficiently to produce a design which was the very one subsequently executed. ... Congress appropriated the old cannon captured by General Jackson. ... Having no notion, nor even suspicion of a dignified sculptural treatment of a theme, the clever carpenter felt, nevertheless, the need of a feature. ... He built a colossal horse, adroitly balanced on the hind legs, and America gazed with bated breath. Nobody knows or cares whether the rider looks like Jackson or not. âThe extraordinary pose of the horse absorbs all attention, all admiration. There may be some subconscious feeling of respect for a rider who holds on so well. ...â (Written while America was in the midst of the war with Germany, August, 1918.) Andrew Jackson was eight feet tall. His arm was a hickory limb and a maul. His sword was so long he dragged it on the ground. Every friend was an equal. Every foe was a hound. Andrew Jackson was a Democrat, Defying kings in his old cocked hat. His vast steed rocked like a hobby-horse. But he sat straight up. He held his course. He licked the British at Noo Orleans; Beat them out of their elegant jeans. He piled the cotton-bales twenty feet high, And he snorted âfreedom,â and it flashed from his eye. And the American Eagle swooped through the air, And cheered when he heard the Jackson swear:â âBy the Eternal, let them come. Sound Yankee Doodle. Let the bullets hum.â And his wild men, straight from the woods, fought on Till the British fops were dead and gone. And now old Andrew Jackson fights To set the sad big world to rights. He joins the British and the French. He cheers up the Italian trench. He's making Democrats of these, And freedom's sons of Japanese. His hobby horse will gallop on Till all the infernal Huns are gone. Yes, Yes, Yes! By the Eternal! Old Andrew Jackson! JOHN L. SULLIVAN, THE STRONG BOY OF BOSTON (Inscribed to Louis Untermeyer and Robert Frost) When I was nine years old, in 1889, I sent my love a lacy Valentine. Suffering boys were dressed like Fauntleroys, While Judge and Puck in giant humor vied. The Gibson Girl came shining like a bride To spoil the cult of Tennyson's Elaine. Louisa Alcott was my gentle guide. ... Then ... I heard a battle trumpet sound. Nigh New Orleans Upon an emerald plain John L. Sullivan The strong boy Of Boston Fought seventy-five red rounds with Jake Kilrain. In simple sheltered 1889 Nick Carter I would piously deride. Over the Elsie Books I moped and sighed. St. Nicholas Magazine was all my pride, While coarser boys on cellar doors would slide. The grown-ups bought refinement by the pound. Rogers groups had not been told to hide. E. P. Roe had just begun to wane. Howells was rising, surely to attain! The nation for a jamboree was gowned.â Her hundredth year of roaring freedom crowned. The British Lion ran and hid from Blaine The razzle-dazzle hip-hurrah from Maine. The mocking bird was singing in the lane. ... Yet ... âEast side, west side, all around the town To be sung. Let the audience join in softly on this tune, wherever it appears. The tots sang: âRing a rosieââ âLondon Bridge is falling down.ââ And ... John L. Sullivan The strong boy Of Boston Broke every single rib of Jake Kilrain. In dear provincial 1889, Barnum's bears and tigers could astound. Ingersoll was called a most vile hound, And named with Satan, Judas, Thomas Paine! Robert Elsmere riled the pious brain. Phillips Brooks for heresy was fried. Boston Brahmins patronized Mark Twain. The baseball rules were changed. That was a gain. Pop Anson was our darling, pet and pride. Native sons in Irish votes were drowned. Tammany once more escaped its chain. Once more each raw saloon was raising Cain. The mocking bird was singing in the lane. ... Yet ... âEast side, west side, all around the town The tots sang: âRing a rosieâ âLondon Bridge is falling down.ââ And ... John L. Sullivan The strong boy Of Boston Finished the ring career of Jake Kilrain. In mystic, ancient 1889, Wilson with pure learning was allied. Roosevelt gave forth a chirping sound. Stanley found old Emin and his train. Stout explorers sought the pole in vain. To dream of flying proved a man insane. The newly rich were bathing in champagne. Van Bibber Davis, at a single bound Displayed himself, and simpering glory found. John J. Ingalls, like a lonely crane Swore and swore, and stalked the Kansas plain. The Cronin murder was the ages' stain. Johnstown was flooded, and the whole world cried. We heard not of Louvain nor of Lorraine, Or a million heroes for their freedom slain. Of Armageddon and the world's birth-painâ The League of Nations, the new world allied, With Wilson, crucified, then justified. We thought the world would loaf and sprawl and mosey. The gods of Yap and Swat were sweetly dozy. We thought the far-off gods of Chow had died. The mocking bird was singing in the lane. ... Yet ... âEast side, west side, all around the town The tots sang: âRing a rosieâ âLondon Bridge is Falling Down.ââ And ... John L. Sullivan knocked out Jake Kilrain. THE EAGLE THAT IS FORGOTTEN (John P. Altgeld. Born December 30, 1847; died March 12, 1902) Sleep softly ... eagle forgotten ... under the stone. Time has its way with you there, and the clay has its own. âWe have buried him now,â thought your foes, and in secret rejoiced. They made a brave show of their mourning, their hatred unvoiced. They had snarled at you, barked at you, foamed at you day after day. Now you were ended. They praised you, ... and laid you away. The others that mourned you in silence and terror and truth, The widow bereft of her crust, and the boy without youth, The mocked and the scorned and the wounded, the lame and the poor That should have remembered forever, ... remember no more. Where are those lovers of yours, on what name do they call The lost, that in armies wept over your funeral pall? They call on the names of a hundred high-valiant ones, A hundred white eagles have risen the sons of your sons, The zeal in their wings is a zeal that your dreaming began The valor that wore out your soul in the service of man. Sleep softly, ... eagle forgotten, ... under the stone, Time has its way with you there and the clay has its own. Sleep on, O brave-hearted, O wise man, that kindled the flameâ To live in mankind is far more than to live in a name, To live in mankind, far, far more ... than to live in a name. BRYAN, BRYAN, BRYAN, BRYAN The Campaign of Eighteen Ninety-six, as Viewed at the Time by a Sixteen-Year-Old, etc. I In a nation of one hundred fine, mob-hearted, lynching, relenting, repenting millions, There are plenty of sweeping, swinging, stinging, gorgeous things to shout about, And knock your old blue devils out. I brag and chant of Bryan, Bryan, Bryan, Candidate for president who sketched a silver Zion, The one American Poet who could sing outdoors, He brought in tides of wonder, of unprecedented splendor, Wild roses from the plains, that made hearts tender, All the funny circus silks Of politics unfurled, Bartlett pears of romance that were honey at the cores, And torchlights down the street, to the end of the world. There were truths eternal in the gab and tittle-tattle. There were real heads broken in the fustian and the rattle. There were real lines drawn: Not the silver and the gold, But Nebraska's cry went eastward against the dour and old, The mean and cold. It was eighteen ninety-six, and I was just sixteen And Altgeld ruled in Springfield, Illinois, When there came from the sunset Nebraska's shout of joy: In a coat like a deacon, in a black Stetson hat He scourged the elephant plutocrats With barbed wire from the Platte. The scales dropped from their mighty eyes. They saw that summer's noon A tribe of wonders coming To a marching tune. Oh, the longhorns from Texas, The jay hawks from Kansas, The plop-eyed bungaroo and giant giassicus, The varmint, chipmunk, bugaboo, The horned-toad, prairie-dog and ballyhoo, From all the newborn states arow, Bidding the eagles of the west fly on, Bidding the eagles of the west fly on. The fawn, prodactyl and thing-a-ma-jig, The rakaboor, the hellangone, The whangdoodle, batfowl and pig, The coyote, wild-cat and grizzly in a glow, In a miracle of health and speed, the whole breed abreast, They leaped the Mississippi, blue border of the West, From the Gulf to Canada, two thousand miles long:â Against the towns of Tubal Cain, Ah,âsharp was their song. Against the ways of Tubal Cain, too cunning for the young, The longhorn calf, the buffalo and wampus gave tongue. These creatures were defending things Mark Hanna never dreamed: The moods of airy childhood that in desert dews gleamed, The gossamers and whimsies, The monkeyshines and didoes Rank and strange Of the canyons and the range, The ultimate fantastics Of the far western slope, And of prairie schooner children Born beneath the stars, Beneath falling snows, Of the babies born at midnight In the sod huts of lost hope, With no physician there, Except a Kansas prayer, With the Indian raid a howling through the air. And all these in their helpless days By the dour East oppressed, Mean paternalism Making their mistakes for them, Crucifying half the West, Till the whole Atlantic coast Seemed a giant spiders' nest. And these children and their sons At last rode through the cactus, A cliff of mighty cowboys On the lope, With gun and rope. And all the way to frightened Maine the old East heard them call, And saw our Bryan by a mile lead the wall Of men and whirling flowers and beasts, The bard and the prophet of them all. Prairie avenger, mountain lion, Bryan, Bryan, Bryan, Bryan, Gigantic troubadour, speaking like a siege gun, Smashing Plymouth Rock with his boulders from the West, And just a hundred miles behind, tornadoes piled across the sky, Blotting out sun and moon, A sign on high. Headlong, dazed and blinking in the weird green light, The scalawags made moan, Afraid to fight. II When Bryan came to Springfield, and Altgeld gave him greeting, Rochester was deserted, Divernon was deserted, Mechanicsburg, Riverton, Chickenbristle, Cotton Hill, Empty: for all Sangamon drove to the meetingâ In silver-decked racing cart, Buggy, buckboard, carryall, Carriage, phaeton, whatever would haul, And silver-decked farm-wagons gritted, banged and rolled, With the new tale of Bryan by the iron tires told. The State House loomed afar, A speck, a hive, a football, A captive balloon! And the town was all one spreading wing of bunting, plumes, and sunshine, Every rag and flag, and Bryan picture sold, When the rigs in many a dusty line Jammed our streets at noon, And joined the wild parade against the power of gold. We roamed, we boys from High School, With mankind, While Springfield gleamed, Silk-lined. Oh, Tom Dines, and Art Fitzgerald, And the gangs that they could get! I can hear them yelling yet. Helping the incantation, Defying aristocracy, With every bridle gone, Ridding the world of the low down mean, Bidding the eagles of the West fly on, Bidding the eagles of the West fly on, We were bully, wild and woolly, Never yet curried below the knees. We saw flowers in the air, Fair as the Pleiades, bright as Orion, âHopes of all mankind, Made rare, resistless, thrice refined. Oh, we bucks from every Springfield ward! Colts of democracyâ Yet time-winds out of Chaos from the star-fields of the Lord. The long parade rolled on. I stood by my best girl. She was a cool young citizen, with wise and laughing eyes. With my necktie by my ear, I was stepping on my dear, But she kept like a pattern, without a shaken curl. She wore in her hair a brave prairie rose. Her gold chums cut her, for that was not the pose. No Gibson Girl would wear it in that fresh way. But we were fairy Democrats, and this was our day. The earth rocked like the ocean, the sidewalk was a deck. The houses for the moment were lost in the wide wreck. And the bands played strange and stranger music as they trailed along. Against the ways of Tubal Cain, Ah, sharp was their song! The demons in the bricks, the demons in the grass, The demons in the bank-vaults peered out to see us pass, And the angels in the trees, the angels in the grass, The angels in the flags, peered out to see us pass. And the sidewalk was our chariot, and the flowers bloomed higher, And the street turned to silver and the grass turned to fire, And then it was but grass, and the town was there again, A place for women and men. III Then we stood where we could see Every band, And the speaker's stand. And Bryan took the platform. And he was introduced. And he lifted his hand And cast a new spell. Progressive silence fell In Springfield, In Illinois, Around the world. Then we heard these glacial boulders across the prairie rolled: âThe people have a right to make their own mistakes. ... You shall not crucify mankind Upon a cross of gold.â And everybody heard himâ In the streets and State House yard. And everybody heard him In Springfield, In Illinois, Around and around and around the world, That danced upon its axis And like a darling broncho whirled. IV July, August, suspense. Wall Street lost to sense. August, September, October, More suspense, And the whole East down like a wind-smashed fence. Then Hanna to the rescue, Hanna of Ohio, Rallying the roller-tops, Rallying the bucket-shops. Threatening drouth and death, Promising manna, Rallying the trusts against the bawling flannelmouth; Invading misers' cellars, Tin-cans, socks, Melting down the rocks, Pouring out the long green to a million workers, Spondulix by the mountain-load, to stop each new tornado, And beat the cheapskate, blatherskite, Populistic, anarchistic, Deaconâdesperado. V Election night at midnight: Boy Bryan's defeat. Defeat of western silver. Defeat of the wheat. Victory of letterfiles And plutocrats in miles With dollar signs upon their coats, Diamond watchchains on their vests And spats on their feet. Victory of custodians, Plymouth Rock, And all that inbred landlord stock. Victory of the neat. Defeat of the aspen groves of Colorado valleys, The blue bells of the Rockies, And blue bonnets of old Texas, By the Pittsburg alleys. Defeat of alfalfa and the Mariposa lily. Defeat of the Pacific and the long Mississippi. Defeat of the young by the old and silly. Defeat of tornadoes by the poison vats supreme. Defeat of my boyhood, defeat of my dream. VI Where is McKinley, that respectable McKinley, The man without an angle or a tangle, Who soothed down the city man and soothed down the farmer, The German, the Irish, the Southerner, the Northerner, Who climbed every greasy pole, and slipped through every crack; Who soothed down the gambling hall, the bar-room, the church, The devil vote, the angel vote, the neutral vote, The desperately wicked, and their victims on the rack, The gold vote, the silver vote, the brass vote, the lead vote, Every vote? ... Where is McKinley, Mark Hanna's McKinley, His slave, his echo, his suit of clothes? Gone to join the shadows, with the pomps of that time, And the flame of that summer's prairie rose. Where is Cleveland whom the Democratic platform Read from the party in a glorious hour, Gone to join the shadows with pitchfork Tillman, And sledge-hammer Altgeld who wrecked his power. Where is Hanna, bulldog Hanna. Low-browed Hanna. who said: âStand patâ? Gone to his place with old Pierpont Morgan. Gone somewhere ... with lean rat Platt. Where is Roosevelt, the young dude cowboy, Who hated Bryan, then aped his way? Gone to join the shadows with mighty Cromwell And tall King Saul, till the Judgment day. Where is Altgeld, brave as the truth, Whose name the few still say with tears? Gone to join the ironies with Old John Brown, Whose fame rings loud for a thousand years. Where is that boy, that Heaven-born Bryan, That Homer Bryan, who sang from the West? Gone to join the shadows with Altgeld the Eagle, Where the kings and the slaves and the troubadours rest. Written at the Guanella Ranch, Empire, Colorado, August, 1919. OUR MOTHER POCAHONTAS (Note:âPocahontas is buried at Gravesend, England.) âPocahontas' body, lovely as a poplar, sweet as a red haw in November or a pawpaw in Mayâdid she wonder? does she rememberâin the dustâin the cool tombs?â Carl Sandburg. I Powhatan was conqueror, Powhatan was emperor. He was akin to wolf and bee, Brother of the hickory tree. Son of the red lightning stroke And the lightning-shivered oak. His panther-grace bloomed in the maid Who laughed among the winds and played In excellence of savage pride, Wooing the forest, open-eyed, In the springtime, In Virginia, Our Mother, Pocahontas. Her skin was rosy copper-red. And high she held her beauteous head. Her step was like a rustling leaf: Her heart a nest, untouched of grief. She dreamed of sons like Powhatan, And through her blood the lightning ran. Love-cries with the birds she sung, Birdlike In the grape-vine swung. The Forest, arching low and wide Gloried in its Indian bride. Rolfe, that dim adventurer, Had not come a courtier. John Rolfe is not our ancestor. We rise from out the soul of her Held in native wonderland, While the sun's rays kissed her hand, In the springtime, In Virginia, Our Mother, Pocahontas. II She heard the forest talking, And from her grave came walking, Across the sea came walking, And traced the paths of Daniel Boone, Then westward chased the painted moon. She passed with wild young feet On to Kansas wheat, On to the miners' west, The echoing caÃ±ons' guest, Then the Pacific sand, Waking, Thrilling, The midnight land. ... On Adams Street and Jeffersonâ Flames coming up from the ground! On Jackson Street and Washingtonâ Flames coming up from the ground! And why, until the dawning sun Are flames coming up from the ground? Because, through drowsy Springfield sped This redskin queen, with feathered head, With winds and stars, that pay her court And leaping beasts, that make her sport; Because, gray Europe's rags august She tramples in the dust; Because we are her fields of corn; Because our fires are all reborn From her bosom's deathless embers, Flaming As she remembers The springtime And Virginia, Our Mother, Pocahontas. III We here renounce our Saxon blood. Tomorrow's hopes, an April flood Come roaring in. The newest race Is born of her resilient grace. We here renounce our Teuton pride: Our Norse and Slavic boasts have died: Italian dreams are swept away, And Celtic feuds are lost today. ... She sings of lilacs, maples, wheat, Her own soil sings beneath her feet, Of springtime And Virginia, Our Mother, Pocahontas. SECTION II ORATIONS, COLLEGE WAR-CRIES, AND OLYMPIC GAMES THE LAST SONG OF LUCIFER (To Be Read Like a Meditation) In the following narrative, Lucifer is not Satan, King of Evil, who in the beginning led the rebels from Heaven, establishing the underworld. Lucifer is here taken as a character appearing much later, the first singing creature weary of established ways in music, moved with the lust of wandering. He finds the open road between the stars too lonely. He wanders to the kingdom of of Satan, there to sing a song that so moves demons and angels that he is, at its climax, momentary emperor of Hell and Heaven, and the flame kindled of the tears of the demons devastates the golden streets. Therefore it is best for the established order of things that this wanderer shall be cursed with eternal silence and death. But since then there has been music in every temptation, in every demon voice. Along with a set of verses called âThe Heroes of Time,â and another âThe Tree of Laughing Bells,â I exchanged âThe Last Song of Luciferâ for a night's lodging in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Ohio, as narrated in A Handy Guide for Beggars. The fourteenth chapter of Isaiah contains these words on Lucifer: âThy pomp is brought down to the grave, and the noise of thy viols: the worm is spread under thee and the worms cover thee. âHow art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! How art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations! âFor thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God. ... All the kings of the nations, even all of them, lie in glory, every one in his own house. âBut thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch, and as the raiment of those that are slain, thrust through with a sword, that go down to the stones of the pit; as a carcas trodden under feet. âThou shalt not be joined with them in burial, because thou hast destroyed thy land.â When Lucifer was undefiled, Lucifer dreams of his fate and then forgets the dream. When Lucifer was young, When only angel-music Fell from his glorious tongue, Dreaming in his innocence Beneath God's golden trees By genius pure his fancy fellâ By sweet divine diseaseâ To a wilderness of sorrows dim Beneath the ether seas. That father of radiant harmony, Of music transcendently brightâ Truest to art since Heaven began, Wrapped in royal, melodious lightâ That beautiful light-bearer, lofty and loyal Dreamed bitter dreams of enigma and night. But soon the singer woke and stood And tuned his harp to sing anew And scorned the dreams (as well he should) For only to the evil crew Are dreams of dread and evil true, Remembered well, or understood. But when a million years were done The dream is fulfilled. And a million, million years beside, He broke his harp-strings one by one; He sighed, aweary of rich things, He spread his pallid, heavy wings And flew to find the deathless stains, The wounds that come with wanderings. He chose the solemn paths of Hell, He will never dream again, but the demons dream of wandering and singing, and doing all things just as he did in his day. He sang for that dumb land too well, Defying their disdain Till he was cursed and slain. Ahâhe shall never dream againâ Mourn, for he shall not dream againâ But the demons dream in pain, Of wandering in the night, And singing in the night, Singing till they reign. Oh, hallowed are the demons, Music is holy, even in the infernal world. A-dreaming songs again, And holy to my heart the ancient music-art, That echo of a memory in demon-haunted men, That hope of music, sweet hope, vain, That sets the world a-seekingâ A passion pure, a subtle pain Too dear for song or speaking. If Lucifer's song could be completely remembered, one would be willing to pay the great price. Oh, who would not with the demons be, For the fullness of their memory Of that dayspring song, Of that holy thing That Lucifer alone could sing, That Hell and Earth so hopelessly And gloriously are seeking! Now follows what every demon says in his heart, remembering that time Oh, Lucifer, great Lucifer, Oh, fallen, ancient Lucifer, Master lost, of the angel choirâ Silent, suffering Lucifer: How the singer made his lyre. Once your alchemies of Hell Wrought your chains to a magic lyre All strung with threads of purple fire, Till the hell-hounds moaned from your bitter spellâ The sweetest song since the demons fellâ Haunting song of the heart's desire. Oh, Lucifer, great Lucifer, How the song began. You who have sung in vain, Ecstasy of sweet regret, Ecstasy of pain, Strain that the angels can never forget, Haunting the children of punishment yet, Bowing them, bringing their tears in the darkness; Oh, the night-caves of Chaos are breathing it yet! The last that your bosom may ever deliver, Oh, musical master of Ã¦ons and Ã¦ons. ... Nor devils nor dragons may ever forget, Though the walls of our prison should crumble and shiver, And the death-dews of Chaos our armor should wet, For the song of the infamous Lucifer Was an anthem of glorious scorning And courage, and horrible painâ Was the song of a Son of the Morning, A song that was sung in vain. Oh, singing was only in Heaven Ere Lucifer's melody came, But when Lucifer's harp-strings grew loud in their sighing, When he called up the dragons by nameâ The song was the sorrow of sorrows, The song was the Hope of Despair, Or the smile of a warrior fallingâ A prayer and a curse and a prayerâ Or a soul going down through the shadows and calling, Or the laughter of Night in his lair; The song was the fear of ten thousand tomorrowsâ On the racks of grief and of painâ The herald of silences, dreadful, unending, When the last little echo should listen in vain. ... It was memory, memory, How the song made the demons dream they were still fighting for Satan. Visions of glory,â Memory, memory, Visions of fight. The pride of the onset, The banners that fluttered, The wails of the battle-pierced angels of light. Song of the times of the Nether Empire The age when our desperate band Heaped our redoubts with the horrible fire On the fringes of Holier Landâ Conquering always, conquering never, Building a throne of sandâ When Satan still wielded that glorious scepterâ The sword of his glorious hand. Then rang the martial music Sung by the hosts of God In the first of the shameful years of fear When we bit the purple sod: He sang that shameful battle-storyâ He twanged each threaded torture-flame; Wherever his leprous fingers came They drew from the strings a groan of glory: Then we dreamed at last, How the song enchanted them till they were in fancy the good warriors of God, and they shouted their enemy's battle-cry. Then we lost the past, We dreamed we were angels in battle-array: We tore our hearts with God's battle-yell And the sound crashed up from the smoky fen And the battle sweat stood forth On the awful brows of our fighting men: And the magical singer, grim and wild, Swept his harp again, and smiled, And the harp-strings lifted our cries that day Till the thundering charge reached the City on Highâ God's charge, that he thought Had passed for aye, When our last fond hope went down to die. Oh, throbbing, sweet enthralling spell! Madly, madly, oh, my heartâ Heart of anguish, heart of Hellâ How, at the climax of the song Lucifer almost restored the first day of creation, when the Universe was happy and sinless. Beat the music through your nightâ Pierced the strain that the wanderer Wrought with fingers white; For last he sangâof the morningâ The song of the Sons of the Morningâ The fire of the star-souled Lucifer Before he had known a stain; That song which came when the suns were young And the Dayspring knew his placeâ That joy, full born, that unknown tongue, How the tears of the distracted demons became a heaven-climbing flame. That shouting chant of the Sons of God When first they saw Jehovah's face. And the Wanderer laughed, then sang it at last Till it leaped as a flame to the forest on high And the tears of the demons were fire in the sky. And just for a breath he conquered and reigned, How Lucifer seemed to make himself God. For one quick pulse of time he stood; By flame was crowned where God had been Himself the Word sublimeâ Himself the Most High Love unstained, The Great, Good King of the Stars and Yearsâ Crowned, enthroned, by a leaping flameâ The fire of our love-born tears. And the angels bowed down, for his glory was vastâ How the angels were conquered by the sound of his music from afar, and the Demons were torn with love. Loving their conquerer, weeping aghastâ While we sobbed, for a moment repenting the past, And the mock-hope came, that eats and stings, The hope for innocent dawns above, The joy of it beat in our ears like wings, Our iron cheeks seared with the tears of loveâ Was it not enough, Was it not enough That our cheeks were seared with the tears of Love? So we cursed the harping of Lucifer Demons and angels curse the singer. The lyre was lost from his leper hands And the hell-hounds tore his living heart. And the angels cursed great Lucifer For his purple flame consumed their lands Till golden ways were desert sands; They hurled him down, afar, apart. Beneath where the Gulfs of Silence end, The Punishment. Where never sighs nor songs descend, Never a hell-flare in his eyes Alone, alone, afar he lies. ... Fearfully alone, beyond immortal ken He is further down in the deep of pain Than is Hell from the grief of men; And his memories of music Are rare as desert-rain. Ended forever the ecstasy And song too sweet for scorningâ The song that was still in vain; And the shout of the battle-charge of Godâ Ended forever the Song of the Morningâ The Song that was sung in vain.

Every girl, Maid or wife, Wild with music, Eyes agleam With that marvel called desire: Actress, princess, fit for life, Armed with honor like a knife, Jumping thro' the hoops of fire. (Listen to the lion roar!) Making all the children shout Clowns shall tumble all about, Painted high and full of song While the cheering rolls along, Tho' they scream, Tho' they rage, Every beast in his cage, Every beast in his den, That aforetime troubled men.

Prophet-singers will arise, Prophets coming after me, Sing my song in softer guise With more delicate surprise; I am but the pioneer Voice of the Democracy; I am the gutter dream, I am the golden dream, Singing science, singing steam. I will blow the proud folk down, (Listen to the lion roar!) I am the Kallyope, Kallyope, Kallyope, Tooting hope, tooting hope, tooting hope, tooting hope, Willy willy willy wah HOO! Hoot, toot, hoot toot, hoot toot, hoot toot, Whoop whoop, whoop whoop, Whoop whoop, whoop whoop, Willy willy willy wah HOO! Sizz.... Fizz.... GENERAL WILLIAM BOOTH ENTERS INTO HEAVEN (To be sung to the tune of âThe Blood of the Lambâ with indicated instrument) I (Bass drum beaten loudly.) Booth led boldly with his big bass drumâ (Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?) The Saints smiled gravely and they said: âHe's come.â (Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?) Walking lepers followed, rank on rank, Lurching bravos from the ditches dank, Drabs from the alleyways and drug fiends paleâ Minds still passion-ridden, soul-powers frail:â Vermin-eaten saints with moldy breath, Unwashed legions with the ways of Deathâ (Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?) (Banjos.) Every slum had sent its half-a-score The round world over. (Booth had groaned for more.) Every banner that the wide world flies Bloomed with glory and transcendent dyes. Big-voiced lasses made their banjos bang, Tranced, fanatical they shrieked and sang:â âAre you washed in the blood of the Lamb?â Hallelujah! It was queer to see Bull-necked convicts with that land make free. Loons with trumpets blowed a blare, blare, blare On, on upward thro' the golden air! (Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?) II (Bass drum slower and softer.) Booth died blind and still by faith he trod, Eyes still dazzled by the ways of God. Booth led boldly, and he looked the chief Eagle countenance in sharp relief, Beard a-flying, air of high command Unabated in that holy land. (Sweet flute music.) Jesus came from out the court-house door, Stretched his hands above the passing poor. Booth saw not, but led his queer ones there Round and round the mighty court-house square. Then, in an instant all that blear review Marched on spotless, clad in raiment new. The lame were straightened, withered limbs uncurled And blind eyes opened on a new, sweet world. (Bass drum louder.) Drabs and vixens in a flash made whole! Gone was the weasel-head, the snout, the jowl! Sages and sibyls now, and athletes clean, Rulers of empires, and of forests green! (Grand chorus of all instruments. Tambourines to the foreground.) The hosts were sandalled, and their wings were fire! (Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?) But their noise played havoc with the angel-choir. (Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?) Oh, shout Salvation! It was good to see Kings and Princes by the Lamb set free. The banjos rattled and the tambourines Jing-jing-jingled in the hands of Queens. (Reverently sung, no instruments.) And when Booth halted by the curb for prayer He saw his Master thro' the flag-filled air. Christ came gently with a robe and crown For Booth the soldier, while the throng knelt down. He saw King Jesus. They were face to face, And he knelt a-weeping in that holy place. Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb? THE KING OF YELLOW BUTTERFLIES (A Poem Game) The King of Yellow Butterflies, The King of Yellow Butterflies, The King of Yellow Butterflies, Now orders forth his men. He says âThe time is almost here When violets bloom again.â Adown the road the fickle rout Goes flashing proud and bold, Adown the road the fickle rout Goes flashing proud and bold, Adown the road the fickle rout Goes flashing proud and bold, They shiver by the shallow pools, They shiver by the shallow pools, They shiver by the shallow pools, And whimper of the cold. They drink and drink. A frail pretense! They love to pose and preen. Each pool is but a looking glass, Where their sweet wings are seen. Each pool is but a looking glass, Where their sweet wings are seen. Each pool is but a looking glass, Where their sweet wings are seen. Gentlemen adventurers! Gypsies every whit! They live on what they steal. Their wings By briars are frayed a bit. Their loves are light. They have no house. And if it rains today, They'll climb into your cattle-shed, They'll climb into your cattle-shed, They'll climb into your cattle-shed, And hide them in the hay, And hide them in the hay, And hide them in the hay, And hide them in the hay. THE POTATOES' DANCE (A Poem Game) I âDown cellar,â said the cricket, âDown cellar,â said the cricket, âDown cellar,â said the cricket, âI saw a ball last night, In honor of a lady, In honor of a lady, In honor of a lady, Whose wings were pearly white. The breath of bitter weather, The breath of bitter weather, The breath of bitter weather, Had smashed the cellar pane. We entertained a drift of leaves, We entertained a drift of leaves, We entertained a drift of leaves, And then of snow and rain. But we were dressed for winter, But we were dressed for winter, But we were dressed for winter, And loved to hear it blow In honor of the lady, In honor of the lady, In honor of the lady, Who makes potatoes grow, Our guest the Irish lady, The tiny Irish lady, The airy Irish lady, Who makes potatoes grow. II âPotatoes were the waiters, Potatoes were the waiters, Potatoes were the waiters, Potatoes were the band, Potatoes were the dancers Kicking up the sand, Kicking up the sand, Kicking up the sand, Potatoes were the dancers Kicking up the sand. Their legs were old burnt matches, Their legs were old burnt matches, Their legs were old burnt matches, Their arms were just the same. They jigged and whirled and scrambled, Jigged and whirled and scrambled, Jigged and whirled and scrambled, In honor of the dame, The noble Irish lady Who makes potatoes dance, The witty Irish lady, The saucy Irish lady, The laughing Irish lady Who makes potatoes prance. III âThere was just one sweet potato. He was golden brown and slim. The lady loved his dancing, The lady loved his dancing, The lady loved his dancing, She danced all night with him, She danced all night with him. Alas, he wasn't Irish. So when she flew away, They threw him in the coal-bin, And there he is today, Where they cannot hear his sighs And his weeping for the lady, The glorious Irish lady, The beauteous Irish lady, Who Gives Potatoes Eyes.â ALADDIN AND THE JINN âBring me soft song,â said Aladdin. âThis tailor-shop sings not at all. Chant me a word of the twilight, Of roses that mourn in the fall. Bring me a song like hashish That will comfort the stale and the sad, For I would be mending my spirit, Forgetting these days that are bad, Forgetting companions too shallow, Their quarrels and arguments thin, Forgetting the shouting Muezzin:ââ âI am your slave,â said the Jinn. âBring me old wines,â said Aladdin. âI have been a starved pauper too long. Serve them in vessels of jade and of shell, Serve them with fruit and with song:â Wines of pre-Adamite Sultans Digged from beneath the black seas:â New-gathered dew from the heavens Dripped down from Heaven's sweet trees, Cups from the angels' pale tables That will make me both handsome and wise, For I have beheld her, the princess, Firelight and starlight her eyes. Pauper I am, I would woo her. Andâlet me drink wine, to begin, Though the Koran expressly forbids it.â âI am your slave,â said the Jinn. âPlan me a dome,â said Aladdin, âThat is drawn like the dawn of the MOON, When the sphere seems to rest on the mountains, Half-hidden, yet full-risen soon. Build me a dome,â said Aladdin, âThat shall cause all young lovers to sigh, The fullness of life and of beauty, Peace beyond peace to the eyeâ A palace of foam and of opal, Pure moonlight without and within, Where I may enthrone my sweet lady.â âI am your slave,â said the Jinn. THE MASTER OF THE DANCE (A chant to which it is intended a group of children shall dance and improvise pantomime led by their dancing-teacher) I A master deep-eyed Ere his manhood was ripe, He sang like a thrush, He could play any pipe. So dull in the school That he scarcely could spell, He read but a bit, And he figured not well. A barefooted fool, Shod only with grace; Long hair streaming down Round a wind-hardened face; He smiled like a girl, Or like clear winter skies, A virginal light Making stars of his eyes. In swiftness and poise, A proud child of the deer, A white fawn he was, Yet a fawn without fear. No youth thought him vain, Or made mock of his hair, Or laughed when his ways Were most curiously fair. A mastiff at fight, He could strike to the earth The envious one Who would challenge his worth. However we bowed To the schoolmaster mild, Our spirits went out To the fawn-footed child. His beckoning led Our troop to the brush. We found nothing there But a wind and a hush. He sat by a stone And he looked on the ground, As if in the weeds There was something profound. His pipe seemed to neigh, Then to bleat like a sheep, Then sound like a stream Or a waterfall deep. It whispered strange tales, Human words it spoke not. Told fair things to come, And our marvellous lot If now with fawn-steps Unshod we advanced To the midst of the grove And in reverence danced. We obeyed as he piped Soft grass to young feet, Was a medicine mighty, A remedy meet. Our thin blood awoke, It grew dizzy and wild, Though scarcely a word Moved the lips of a child. Our dance gave allegiance, It set us apart, We tripped a strange measure, Uplifted of heart. II We thought to be proud Of our fawn everywhere. We could hardly see how Simple books were a care. No rule of the school This strange student could tame. He was banished one day, While we quivered with shame. He piped back our love On a moon-silvered night, Enticed us once more To the place of delight. A greeting he sang And it made our blood beat, It tramped upon custom And mocked at defeat. He builded a fire And we tripped in a ring, The embers our books And the fawn our good king. And now we approached All the mysteries rare That shadowed his eyelids And blew through his hair. That spell now was peace The deep strength of the trees, The children of nature We clambered her knees. Our breath and our moods Were in tune with her own, Tremendous her presence, Eternal her throne. The ostracized child Our white foreheads kissed, Our bodies and souls Became lighter than mist. Sweet dresses like snow Our small lady-loves wore, Like moonlight the thoughts That our bosoms upbore. Like a lily the touch Of each cold little hand. The loves of the stars We could now understand. O quivering air! O the crystalline night! O pauses of awe And the faces swan-white! O ferns in the dusk! O forest-shrined hour! O earth that sent upward The thrill and the power, To lift us like leaves, A delirious whirl, The masterful boy And the delicate girl! What child that strange night-time Can ever forget? His fealty due And his infinite debt To the folly divine, To the exquisite rule Of the perilous master, The fawn-footed fool? III Now soldiers we seem, And night brings a new thing, A terrible ire, As of thunder a-wing. A warrior power, That old chivalry stirred, When knights took up arms, As the maidens gave word. The END OF OUR WAR, Will BE GLORY UNTOLD. When THE TOWN LIKE A GREAT Budding ROSE SHALL UNFOLD! Near, nearer that war, And that ecstasy comes, We hear the trees beating Invisible drums. The fields of the night Are starlit above, Our girls are white torches Of conquest and love. No nerve without will, And no breast without breath We whirl with the planets That never know death! A DIRGE FOR A RIGHTEOUS KITTEN (To be intoned, all but the two italicized lines, which are to be spoken in a snappy, matter-of-fact way) Ding-dong, ding-dong, ding-dong. Here lies a kitten good, who kept A kitten's proper place. He stole no pantry eatables, Nor scratched the baby's face. He let the alley-cats alone. He had no yowling vice. His shirt was always laundried well, He freed the house of mice. Until his death he had not caused His little mistress tears, He wore his ribbon prettily, He washed behind his ears. Ding-dong, ding-dong, ding-dong. THE LAME BOY AND THE FAIRY (To they rythm of Chopin's Berceuse) A lame boy Met a fairy In a meadow Where the bells grow. And the fairy Kissed him gaily. And the fairy Gave him friendship, Gave him healing, Gave him wings. âAll the fashions I will give you. You will fly, dear, All the long year. âWings of springtime, Wings of summer, Wings of autumn, Wings of winter! âHere is A dress for springtime.â And she gave him A dress of grasses, Orchard blossoms, Wild-flowers found in Mountain passes, Shoes of song and Wings of rhyme. âHere is A dress for summer.â And she gave him A hat of sunflowers, A suit of poppies, Clover, daisies, All from wheat-sheaves In harvest time; Shoes of song and Wings of rhyme. âHere is A dress for autumn.â And she gave him A suit of red haw, Hickory, apple, Elder, pawpaw, Maple, hazel, Elm and grape leaves, And blue And white Cloaks of smoke, And veils of sunlight, From the Indian summer prime! Shoes of song and Wings of rhyme. âHere is A dress for winter.â And she gave him A polar bear suit, And he heard the Christmas horns toot, And she gave him Green festoons and Red balloons and All the sweet cakes And the snowflakes Of Christmas time, Shoes of song and Wings of rhyme. And the fairy Kept him laughing, Led him dancing, Kept him climbing On the hilltops Toward the moon. âWe shall see silver ships. We shall see singing ships, Valleys of spray today, Mountains of foam. We have been long away, Far from our wonderland. Here come the ships of love Taking us home. âWho are our captains bold? They are the saints of old. One is Saint Christopher. He takes your hand. He leads the cloudy fleet. He gives us bread and meat. His is our ship till We reach our dear land. âWhere is our house to be? Far in the ether sea. There where the North Star Is moored in the deep. Sleepy old comets nod There on the silver sod. Sleepy young fairy flowers Laugh in their sleep. âA hundred years And A day, There we will fly And play I-spy and cross-tag. And meet on the highway, And call to the game Little Red Riding Hood, Goldilocks, Santa Claus, Every beloved And heart-shaking name.â And the lame child And the fairy Journeyed far, far To the North Star. THE BLACKSMITH'S SERENADE (A pantomine and farce, to be acted by My Lady on one side of a shutter while the singer chants on the other, to an iron guitar) John Littlehouse the redhead was a large ruddy man Quite proud to be a blacksmith, and he loved Polly Ann, Polly Ann. Straightway to her window with his iron guitar he came Breathing like a blacksmithâhis wonderful heart's flame. Though not very bashful and not very bold He had reached the plain conclusion his passion must be told. And so he sang: âAwake, awake,ââthis hip-hoo-ray-ious man. âDo you like me, do you love me, Polly Ann, Polly Ann? The rooster on my coalshed crows at break of day. It makes a person happy to hear his roundelay. The fido in my woodshed barks at fall of night. He makes one feel so safe and snug. He barks exactly right. I swear to do my stylish best and purchase all I can Of the flummeries, flunkeries and mummeries of man. And I will carry in the coal and the water from the spring And I will sweep the porches if you will cook and sing. No doubt your Pa sleeps like a rock. Of course Ma is awake But dares not say she hears me, for gentle custom's sake. Your sleeping father knows I am a decent honest man. Will you wake him, Polly Ann, And if he dares deny it I will thrash him, lash bash mash Hash him, Polly Ann. Hum hum hum, fee fie fo fumâ And my brawn should wed your beauty. Do you hear me, Polly Ann, Polly Ann?â Polly had not heard of him before, but heard him now. She blushed behind the shutters like a pippin on the bough. She was not overfluttered, she was not overbold. She was glad a lad was living with a passion to be told. But she spoke up to her mother: âOh, what an awful man:ââ This merry merry quite contrary tricky trixy, Polly Ann, Polly Ann. The neighbors put their heads out of the windows. They said:â âWhat sort of turtle dove is this that seems to wake the dead?â Yes, in their nighties whispered this question to the night. They did not dare to shout it. It wouldn't be right. And so, I say, they whispered:ââDoes she hear this awful man, Polly Ann, Polly Ann?â John Littlehouse the redhead sang on of his desires: âSteel makes the wires of lyres, makes the frames of terrible towers And circus chariots' tires. Believe me, dear, a blacksmith man can feel. I will bind you, if I can to my ribs with hoops of steel. Do you hear me, Polly Ann, Polly Ann?â And then his tune was silence, for he was not a fool. He let his voice rest, his iron guitar cool. And thus he let the wind sing, the stars sing and the grass sing, The prankishness of love sing, the girl's tingling feet sing, Her trembling sweet hands sing, her mirror in the dark sing, Her grace in the dark sing, her pillow in the dark sing, The savage in her blood sing, her starved little heart sing, Silently sing. âYes, I hear you, Mister Man,â To herself said Polly Ann, Polly Ann. He shouted one great loud âGood night,â and laughed, And skipped home. And every star was winking in the wide wicked dome. And early in the morning, sweet Polly stole away. And though the town went crazy, she is his wife today. THE FAIRY BRIDAL HYMN (This is the hymn to Eleanor, daughter of Mab and a golden drone, sung by the locust choir when the fairy child marries her God, the yellow rose.) This is a song to the white-armed one Cold in the breast as the frost-wrapped Spring, Whose feet are slow on the hills of life, Whose round mouth rules by whispering. This is a song to the white-armed one Whose breast shall burn as a Summer field, Whose wings shall rise to the doors of gold, Whose poppy lips to the God shall yield. This is a song to the white-armed one When the closing rose shall bind her fast, And a song of the song their blood shall sing, When the Rose-God drinks her soul at last. A DOLL'S âARABIAN NIGHTSâ (A Rhymed Scenario for Mae Marsh, when she acts in the new many-colored films) I dreamed the play was real. I walked into the screen. Like Alice through the looking-glass, I found a curious scene. The black stones took on flame. The shadows shone with eyes. The colors poured and changed In a Hell's debauch of dyes, In a street with incense thick, In a court of witch-bazaars, With flambeaux by the stalls Whose splutter hid the stars. Camels stalked in line. Courtezans tripped by Dressed in silks and gems, Copper diadems, All the wealth they had. This refrain to be elaborately articulated and the instrumental music then made to match it precisely. Oh quivering lights, Arabian Nights! Bagdad, Bagdad! You were a guarded girl In a palanquin of gold. I was buying figs: All my hands could hold. You slipped a note to me. Your eyes made me your slave. âTwelve paces back,â you wrote. No other word gave. The delicate dove house swayed Close-veiled, a snare most sweet. âJoy,â said the silver bells On the palanquin-bearers' feet. Then by a mosque, a dervish Yelled and whirled like mad. Oh quivering lights, Arabian Nights! Bagdad, Bagdad! I reached a dim, still court. I saw you there afar, Beckoning from the roof, Veiled, a cloud-wrapped star. And your black slave said: âProud boy, Do you dare everything With your young arm and bright steel? Then climb. You are her king.â And I heard a hiss of knives In the doorway dark and bad. Oh quivering lights, Arabian Nights! Bagdad, Bagdad! The stairway climbed and climbed. It spoke. It shouted lies. I reached a tar-black room, A panther's belly gloom, Filled with howls and sighs. I found the roof. Twelve kings Rose up to stab me there. But I sent them to their graves. My singing shook the air. My scimitar seemed more Than any steel could be, A whirling wheel, a pack Of death-hounds guarding me. And then you came like May. You bound my torn breast well With your discarded veil. And flowery silence fell. While Mohammed spread his wings In the stars, you bent me back, With a quick kiss touched my mouth, And my heart was on the rack. Oh dreadful, deathless love! Oh kiss of Islam fire. And your flashing hands were more Than all a thief's desire. I woke by twelve dead curs The morning after is always noted in the Arabian Nights. On bloody, stony ground. And the gray watch muttered âshameâ As he tottered on his round. You had written on my sword:â âGoodby, O iron arm. I love you much too well To do you further harm. And as my pledge and sign You are in crimson clad.â Oh quivering lights, Arabian Nights! Bagdad, Bagdad! The rocs scream in the air. The ghouls my pathway clear. For I have drunk the soul Of the dazzling maid they fear. The long handclasp you gave Still shakes upon my hands. O, daughter of a Jinn I plot in Islam lands, Haunting purple streets, Hissing, snarling, bold, A robber never jailed, A beggar never cold. I shall be sultan yet In this old crimson clad. Oh quivering lights, Arabian Nights! Bagdad, Bagdad! TWO OLD CROWS Two old crows sat on a fence rail. Two old crows sat on a fence rail, Thinking of effect and cause, Of weeds and flowers, And nature's laws. One of them muttered, one of them stuttered, One of them stuttered, one of them muttered. Each of them thought far more than he uttered. One crow asked the other crow a riddle. One crow asked the other crow a riddle: The muttering crow Asked the stuttering crow, âWhy does a bee have a sword to his fiddle? Why does a bee have a sword to his fiddle?â âBee-cause,â said the other crow, âBee-cause. B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B-cause.â Just then a bee flew close to their rail:â âBuzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz ? zzzzzzzzz ? zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz ZZZZZZZZ.â And those two black crows Turned pale, And away those crows did sail. Why? B B B B B B B B B B B B B B-cause. B B B B B B B B B B B B B B-cause. âBuzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz ? zzzzzzzzzz ? zzzzzzzzzzzzzz ZZZZZZZZ.â THE DRUNKARD'S FUNERAL âYes,â said the sister with the little pinched face, The busy little sister with the funny little tract:â âThis is the climax, the grand fifth act. There rides the proud, at the finish of his race. There goes the hearse, the mourners cry, The respectable hearse goes slowly by. The wife of the dead has money in her purse, The children are in health, so it might have been worse. The fellow in the coffin led a life most foul. A fierce defender of the red bartender, At the church he would rail, At the preacher he would howl. He planted every deviltry to see it grow. He wasted half his income on the lewd and the low. He would trade engender for the red bar-tender, He would homage render to the red bar-tender, And in ultimate surrender to the red bar-tender, He died of the tremens, as crazy as a loon, And his friends were glad, when the end came soon. There goes the hearse, the mourners cry, The respectable hearse goes slowly by. And now, good friends, since you see how it ends, Let each nation-mender flay the red bar-tender,â Abhor The transgression Of the red bar-tender,â Ruin The profession Of the red bar-tender: Force him into business where his work does good. Let him learn how to plough, let him learn to chop wood, Let him learn how to plough, let him learn to chop wood. âThe moral, The conclusion, The verdict now you know:â âThe saloon must go, The saloon must go, The saloon, The saloon, The saloon, Must go.ââ âYou are right, little sister,â I said to myself, âYou are right, good sister,â I said. âThough you wear a mussy bonnet On your little gray head, You are right, little sister,â I said. THE SEA SERPENT CHANTEY I There's a snake on the western wave And his crest is red. He is long as a city street, And he eats the dead. There's a hole in the bottom of the sea Where the snake goes down. And he waits in the bottom of the sea For the men that drown. Chorus:â This is the voice of the sand Let the audience join in the chorus. (The sailors understand) âThere is far more sea than sand, There is far more sea than land. Yo ... ho, yo ... ho.â II He waits by the door of his cave While the ages moan. He cracks the ribs of the ships With his teeth of stone. In his gizzard deep and long Much treasure lies. Oh, the pearls and the Spanish gold. ... And the idols' eyes. ... Oh, the totem poles ... the skulls ... The altars cold ... The wedding rings, the dice ... The buoy bells old. Chorus:â This is the voice, etc. III Dive, mermaids, with sharp swords And cut him through, And bring us the idols' eyes And the red gold too. Lower the grappling hooks Good pirate men And drag him up by the tongue From his deep wet den. We will sail to the end of the world, Repeat as a second chorus many times. We will nail his hide To the mainmast of the moon In the evening tide. IV Or will you let him live, The deep-sea thing, With the wrecks of all the world In a black wide ring By the hole in the bottom of the sea Where the snake goes down, Where he waits in the bottom of the sea For the men that drown? Chorus:â This is the voice, etc. KANSAS Oh, I have walked in Kansas Through many a harvest field, And piled the sheaves of glory there And down the wild rows reeled: Each sheaf a little yellow sun, A heap of hot-rayed gold; Each binder like Creation's hand To mould suns, as of old. Straight overhead the orb of noon Beat down with brimstone breath: The desert wind from south and west Was blistering flame and death. Yet it was gay in Kansas, A-fighting that strong sun; And I and many a fellow-tramp Defied that wind and won. And we felt free in Kansas From any sort of fear, For thirty thousand tramps like us There harvest every year. She stretches arms for them to come, She roars for helpers then, And so it is in Kansas That tramps, one month, are men. We sang in burning Kansas The songs of Sabbath-school, The âDay Starâ flashing in the East, The âVale of Edenâ cool. We sang in splendid Kansas âThe flag that set us freeââ That march of fifty thousand men With Sherman to the sea. We feasted high in Kansas And had much milk and meat. The tables groaned to give us power Wherewith to save the wheat. Our beds were sweet alfalfa hay Within the barn-loft wide. The loft doors opened out upon The endless wheat-field tide. I loved to watch the windmills spin And watch that big moon rise. I dreamed and dreamed with lids half-shut, The moonlight in my eyes. For all men dream in Kansas By noonday and by night, By sunrise yellow, red and wild And moonrise wild and white. The wind would drive the glittering clouds, The cottonwoods would croon, And past the sheaves and through the leaves Came whispers from the moon. THE SANTA-FÃ TRAIL (A HUMORESQUE) (I asked the old negro: âWhat is that bird that sings so well?â He answered: âThat is the Rachel-Jane.â âHasn't it another nameâlark, or thrush, or the like?â âNo. Jus' Rachel-Jane.â) I. In Which a Racing Auto Comes from the East This is the order of the music of the morning;â To be sung delicately, to an improvised tune. First, from the far East comes but a crooning. The crooning turns to a sunrise singing. Hark to the calm-horn, balm-horn, psalm-horn. Hark to the faint-horn, quaint-horn, saint-horn. ... Hark to the pace-horn, chase-horn, race-horn. To be sung or read with great speed. And the holy veil of the dawn has gone. Swiftly the brazen car comes on. It burns in the East as the sunrise burns. I see great flashes where the far trail turns. Its eyes are lamps like the eyes of dragons. It drinks gasoline from big red flagons. Butting through the delicate mists of the morning, It comes like lightning, goes past roaring. It will hail all the windmills, taunting, ringing, Dodge the cyclones, Count the milestones, On through the ranges the prairie-dog tillsâ Scooting past the cattle on the thousand hills. ... Ho for the tear-horn, scare-horn, dare-horn, To be read or sung in a rolling bass, with some deliberation. Ho for the gay-horn, bark-horn, bay-horn. Ho for Kansas, land that restores us When houses choke us, and great books bore us! Sunrise Kansas, harvesters' Kansas, A million men have found you before us. A million men have found you before us. II. In Which Many Autos Pass Westward I want live things in their pride to remain. In an even, deliberate, narrative manner. I will not kill one grasshopper vain Though he eats a hole in my shirt like a door. I let him out, give him one chance more. Perhaps, while he gnaws my hat in his whim, Grasshopper lyrics occur to him. I am a tramp by the long trail's border, Given to squalor, rags and disorder. I nap and amble and yawn and look, Write fool-thoughts in my grubby book, Recite to the children, explore at my ease, Work when I work, beg when I please, Give crank-drawings, that make folks stare To the half-grown boys in the sunset glare, And get me a place to sleep in the hay At the end of a live-and-let-live day. I find in the stubble of the new-cut weeds A whisper and a feasting, all one needs: The whisper of the strawberries, white and red Here where the new-cut weeds lie dead. But I would not walk all alone till I die Without some life-drunk horns going by. And up round this apple-earth they come Blasting the whispers of the morning dumb:â Cars in a plain realistic row. And fair dreams fade When the raw horns blow. On each snapping pennant A big black name:â The careering city Whence each car came. They tour from Memphis, Atlanta, Savannah, Tallahassee and Texarkana. They tour from St. Louis, Columbus, Manistee, Like a train-caller in a Union Depot. They tour from Peoria, Davenport, Kankakee. Cars from Concord, Niagara, Boston, Cars from Topeka, Emporia, and Austin. Cars from Chicago, Hannibal, Cairo. Cars from Alton, Oswego, Toledo. Cars from Buffalo, Kokomo, Delphi, Cars from Lodi, Carmi, Loami. Ho for Kansas, land that restores us When houses choke us, and great books bore us! While I watch the highroad And look at the sky, While I watch the clouds in amazing grandeur Roll their legions without rain Over the blistering Kansas plainâ While I sit by the milestone And watch the sky, The United States Goes by. Listen to the iron-horns, ripping, racking. To be given very harshly, with a snapping explosiveness. Listen to the quack-horns, slack and clacking. Way down the road, trilling like a toad, Here comes the dice-horn, here comes the vice-horn, Here comes the snarl-horn, brawl-horn, lewd-horn, Followed by the prude-horn, bleak and squeaking:â (Some of them from Kansas, some of them from Kansas.) Here comes the hod-horn, plod-horn, sod-horn, Nevermore-to-roam-horn, loam-horn, home-horn. (Some of them from Kansas, some of them from Kansas.) Far away the Rachel-Jane To be read or sung, well-nigh in a whisper. Not defeated by the horns Sings amid a hedge of thorns:â âLove and life, Eternal youthâ Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, Dew and glory, Love and truth, Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet.â While SMOKE-BLACK FREIGHTS ON THE DOUBLE-TRACKED RAILROAD, Louder and louder, faster and faster. Driven AS THOUGH BY THE FOUL FIEND'S OX-GOAD, Screaming TO THE WEST COAST, SCREAMING TO THE EAST, Carry OFF A HARVEST, BRING BACK A FEAST, And HARVESTING MACHINERY AND HARNESS FOR THE BEAST, The HAND-CARS WHIZ, AND RATTLE ON THE RAILS, The SUNLIGHT FLASHES ON THE TIN DINNER-PAILS. And then, in an instant, ye modern men, In a rolling bass, with increasing deliberation. Behold the procession once again, The United States goes by! Listen to the iron-horns, ripping, racking, With a snapping explosiveness. Listen to the wise-horn, desperate-to-advise horn, Listen to the fast-horn, kill-horn, blast-horn. ... Far away the Rachel-Jane To be sung or read well-nigh in a whisper. Not defeated by the horns Sings amid a hedge of thorns:â Love and life, Eternal youth, Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, Dew and glory, Love and truth. Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, The mufflers open on a score of cars To be brawled in the beginning with a snapping explosiveness, ending in a languorous chant. With wonderful thunder, Crack, CRACK, CRACK, Crack-crack, CRACK-CRACK, Crack, CRACK, CRACK, Listen to the gold-horn ... Old-horn ... Cold horn ... And all of the tunes, till the night comes down On hay-stack, and ant-hill, and wind-bitten town. Then far in the west, as in the beginning, To be sung to exactly the same whispered tune as the first five lines. Dim in the distance, sweet in retreating, Hark to the faint-horn, quaint-horn, saint-horn, Hark to the calm-horn, balm-horn, psalm-horn. ... They are hunting the goals that they understand:â This section beginning sonorously, ending in a languorous whisper. San-Francisco and the brown sea-sand. My goal is the mystery the beggars win. I am caught in the web the night-winds spin. The edge of the wheat-ridge speaks to me. I talk with the leaves of the mulberry tree. And now I hear, as I sit all alone In the dusk, by another big Santa-FÃ© stone, The souls of the tall corn gathering round And the gay little souls of the grass in the ground. Listen to the tale the cottonwood tells. Listen to the windmills, singing o'er the wells. Listen to the whistling flutes without price Of myriad prophets out of paradise. Harken to the wonder That the night-air carries. ... Listen ... to ... the ... whisper ... Of ... the ... prairie ... fairies Singing o'er the fairy plain:â To the same whispered tune as the Rachel-Jane songâbut very slowly. âSweet, sweet, sweet, sweet. Love and glory, Stars and rain, Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet. ...â DANIEL (Inscribed to Isadora Bennett Reed) Darius the Mede was a king and a wonder. Beginning with a strain of âDixie.â His eye was proud, and his voice was thunder. He kept bad lions in a monstrous den. He fed up the lions on Christian men. Daniel was the chief hired man of the land. With a touch of âAlexander's Ragtime Band.â He stirred up the music in the palace band. He whitewashed the cellar. He shovelled in the coal. And Daniel kept a-praying:ââLord save my soul.â Daniel kept a-praying:ââLord save my soul.â Daniel kept a-praying:ââLord save my soul.â Daniel was the butler, swagger and swell. He ran up stairs. He answered the bell. And he would let in whoever came a-calling:â Saints so holy, scamps so appalling. âOld man Ahab leaves his card. Elisha and the bears are a-waiting in the yard. Here comes Pharaoh and his snakes a-calling. Here comes Cain and his wife a-calling. Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego for tea. Here comes Jonah and the whale, And the Sea! Here comes St. Peter and his fishing pole. Here comes Judas and his silver a-calling. Here comes old Beelzebub a-calling.â And Daniel kept a-praying:ââLord save my soul.â Daniel kept a-praying:ââLord save my soul.â Daniel kept a-praying:ââLord save my soul.â His sweetheart and his mother were Christian and meek. They washed and ironed for Darius every week. One Thursday he met them at the door:â Paid them as usual, but acted sore. He said:ââYour Daniel is a dead little pigeon. He's a good hard worker, but he talks religion.â And he showed them Daniel in the lions' cage. Daniel standing quietly, the lions in a rage. His good old mother cried:â âLord save him.â And Daniel's tender sweetheart cried:â âLord save him.â And she was a golden lily in the dew. This to be repeated three times, very softly and slowly. And she was as sweet as an apple on the tree, And she was as fine as a melon in the corn-field, Gliding and lovely as a ship on the sea, Gliding and lovely as a ship on the sea. And she prayed to the Lord:â âSend Gabriel. Send Gabriel.â King Darius said to the lions:â âBite Daniel. Bite Daniel. Bite him. Bite him. Bite him!â Thus roared the lions:â Here the audience roars with the leader. âWe want Daniel, Daniel, Daniel, We want Daniel, Daniel, Daniel,â And Daniel did not frown, Daniel did not cry. He kept on looking at the sky. And the Lord said to Gabriel:â âGo chain the lions down, The audience sings this with the leader, to the old negro tune. Go chain the lions down. Go chain the lions down. Go chain the lions down.â And Gabriel chained the lions, And Gabriel chained the lions, And Gabriel chained the lions, And Daniel got out of the den, And Daniel got out of the den, And Daniel got out of the den. And Darius said:ââYou're a Christian child,â Darius said:ââYou're a Christian child,â Darius said:ââYou're a Christian child,â And gave him his job again, And gave him his job again, And gave him his job again. THE BOOKER WASHINGTON TRILOGY (A Memorial to Booker T. Washington) I. Simon LegreeâA Negro Sermon (To be read in your own variety of negro dialect.) Legree's big house was white and green. His cotton-fields were the best to be seen. He had strong horses and opulent cattle, And bloodhounds bold, with chains that would rattle. His garret was full of curious things: Books of magic, bags of gold, And rabbits' feet on long twine strings. But he went down to the Devil. Legree he sported a brass-buttoned coat, A snake-skin necktie, a blood-red shirt. Legree he had a beard like a goat, And a thick hairy neck, and eyes like dirt. His puffed-out cheeks were fish-belly white, He had great long teeth, and an appetite. He ate raw meat, 'most every meal, And rolled his eyes till the cat would squeal. His fist was an enormous size To mash poor niggers that told him lies: He was surely a witch-man in disguise. But he went down to the Devil. He wore hip-boots, and would wade all day To capture his slaves that had fled away. But he went down to the Devil. He beat poor Uncle Tom to death Who prayed for Legree with his last breath. Then Uncle Tom to Eva flew, To the high sanctoriums bright and new; And Simon Legree stared up beneath, And cracked his heels, and ground his teeth: And went down to the Devil. He crossed the yard in the storm and gloom; He went into his grand front room. He said, âI killed him, and I don't care.â He kicked a hound, he gave a swear; He tightened his belt, he took a lamp, Went down cellar to the webs and damp. There in the middle of the mouldy floor He heaved up a slab, he found a doorâ And went down to the Devil. His lamp blew out, but his eyes burned bright. Simon Legree stepped down all nightâ Down, down to the Devil. Simon Legree he reached the place, He saw one half of the human race, He saw the Devil on a wide green throne, Gnawing the meat from a big ham-bone, And he said to Mister Devil: âI see that you have much to eatâ A red ham-bone is surely sweet. I see that you have lion's feet; I see your frame is fat and fine, I see you drink your poison wineâ Blood and burning turpentine.â And the Devil said to Simon Legree: âI like your style, so wicked and free. Come sit and share my throne with me, And let us bark and revel.â And there they sit and gnash their teeth, And each one wears a hop-vine wreath. They are matching pennies and shooting craps, They are playing poker and taking naps. And old Legree is fat and fine: He eats the fire, he drinks the wineâ Blood and burning turpentineâ Down, down with the Devil; Down, down with the Devil; Down, down with the Devil. II. John Brown (To be sung by a leader and chorus, the leader singing the body of the poem, while the chorus interrupts with the question) I've been to Palestine. What did you see in Palestine? I saw the ark of Noahâ It was made of pitch and pine. I saw old Father Noah Asleep beneath his vine. I saw Shem, Ham and Japhet Standing in a line. I saw the tower of Babel In the gorgeous sunrise shineâ By a weeping willow tree Beside the Dead Sea. I've been to Palestine. What did you see in Palestine? I saw abominations And Gadarene swine. I saw the sinful Canaanites Upon the shewbread dine, And spoil the temple vessels And drink the temple wine. I saw Lot's wife, a pillar of salt Standing in the brineâ By a weeping willow tree Beside the Dead Sea. I've been to Palestine. What did you see in Palestine? Cedars on Mount Lebanon, Gold in Ophir's mine, And a wicked generation Seeking for a sign, And Baal's howling worshippers Their god with leaves entwine. And ... I saw the war-horse ramping And shake his forelock fineâ By a weeping willow tree Beside the Dead Sea. I've been to Palestine. What did you see in Palestine? Old John Brown. Old John Brown. I saw his gracious wife Dressed in a homespun gown. I saw his seven sons Before his feet bow down. And he marched with his seven sons, His wagons and goods and guns, To his campfire by the sea, By the waves of Galilee. I've been to Palestine. What did you see in Palestine? I saw the harp and psalt'ry Played for Old John Brown. I heard the ram's horn blow, Blow for Old John Brown. I saw the Bulls of Bashanâ They cheered for Old John Brown. I saw the big Behemothâ He cheered for Old John Brown. I saw the big Leviathanâ He cheered for Old John Brown. I saw the Angel Gabriel Great power to him assign. I saw him fight the Canaanites And set God's Israel free. I saw him when the war was done In his rustic chair reclineâ By his campfire by the sea By the waves of Galilee. I've been to Palestine. What did you see in Palestine? Old John Brown. Old John Brown. And there he sits To judge the world. His hunting-dogs At his feet are curled. His eyes half-closed, But John Brown sees The ends of the earth, The Day of Doom. And his shot-gun lies Across his kneesâ Old John Brown, Old John Brown. III. King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba (A Poem Game) âAnd when the Queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, ... she came to prove him with hard questions.â The men's leader rises as he sees the Queen unveiling and approaching a position that gives her half of the stage. Men's Leader: The Queen of Sheba came to see King Solomon. I am King Solomon, He bows three times. I am King Solomon, I am King Solomon, Women's Leader: I am the Queen, She bows three times. I am the Queen, I am the Queen, Both Leaders: We will be king and queen, Reigning on mountains green, They stand together stretching their hands over the land. Happy and free For ten thousand years. Both Leaders: King Solomon he had four hundred oxen. They stagger forward as though carrying a yoke together. Congregation: We were the oxen. Both Leaders: You shall feel goads no more. Here King and Queen pause at the footlights. They walk backward, throwing off the yoke and rejoicing. Walk dreadful roads no more, Free from your loads For ten thousand years. Both Leaders: King Solomon he had four hundred sweethearts. The men's leader goes forward, the women's leader dances round him. Congregation: We were the sweethearts. Here he pauses at the footlights. He walks backward. Both clap their hands to the measure. Both Leaders: You shall dance round again, You shall dance round again, Cymbals shall sound again, Cymbals shall sound again, Wildflowers be found The Queen appears to gather wildflowers. For ten thousand years, Wildflowers be found For ten thousand years. Both Leaders: And every sweetheart had four hundred swans. He continues to command the congregation, the woman to dance. He goes forward to the footlights. Congregation: We were the swans. Both Leaders: You shall spread wings again, The King walks backward. You shall spread wings again, Fly in soft rings again, Here a special dance, by the Queen: swans flying in circles. Fly in soft rings again, Swim by cool springs For ten thousand years, Swim by cool springs For ten thousand years. Men's Leader: King Solomon, The refrain âKing Solomon may be intoned by the mens' leader whenever it is needed to enable the women's leader to get to her starting point. They bow to each otherâthen give a pantomime indicating a great rose garden. King Solomon. Women's Leader: The Queen of Sheba asked him like a lady, Bowing most politely: âWhat makes the roses bloom Over the mossy tomb, Driving away the gloom Ten thousand years?â Men's Leader: King Solomon made answer to the lady, Bowing most politely: They bow and confer. The Queen reserved, but taking cognizance. The King wooing with ornate gestures of respect, and courtly animation. âThey bloom forever thinking of your beauty, Your step so queenly and your eyes so lovely. These keep the roses fair, Young and without care, Making so sweet the air, Ten thousand years.â Both Leaders: King Solomon he had four hundred sons. The two, with a manner almost a cake walk, go forward. Congregation: We were the sons. On this line, King and Queen pause before the footlights. Both Leaders: Crowned by the throngs again, Pantomime of crowning the audience. On this line they walk backward, playing great imaginary harps. You shall make songs again, Singing along For ten thousand years. Both Leaders: He gave each son four hundred prancing ponies. They go forward in a pony gallop, then stand pawing. Congregation: We were the ponies. Both Leaders: You shall not eat hay again, They nod, and walk backward. In forests play again, Rampage and neigh A pony dance by both, in circles. For ten thousand years. Men's Leader: King Solomon he asked the Queen of Sheba, Bowing most politely: They bow to each other, standing so that each one commands half of the stage. âWhat makes the oak-tree grow Hardy in sun and snow, Never by wind brought low Ten thousand years?â Women's Leader: The Queen of Sheba answered like a lady, Bowing most politely: They bow to each other, again, with pantomime indicating a forest. âIt blooms forever thinking of your wisdom, Your brave heart and the way you rule your kingdom. These keep the oak secure, Weaving its leafy lure, Dreaming by fountains pure Ten thousand years.â Both Leaders: The Queen of Sheba had four hundred sailors. They go to the footlights with a sailors' lurch and hitch. Congregation: We were the sailors. The King and Queen pause. Both Leaders: You shall bring spice and ore Over the ocean's floor, They walk backward with slow long-armed gestures indicating the entire horizon line. Shipmates once more, For ten thousand years. Women's Leader: The Queen of Sheba asked him like a lady, Bowing most politely: They bow to each other, the Queen indicating the depths of the sea. âWhy is the sea so deep, What secret does it keep While tides a-roaring leap Ten thousand years?â Men's Leader: King Solomon made answer to the lady, Bowing most politely: They bow to each other, then confer; the Queen reserved, but taking cognizance, the King wooing with ornate gestures of respect and courtly admiration. âMy love for you is like the stormy oceanâ Too deep to understand, Bending to your own command, Bringing your ships to land Ten thousand years.â King Solomon, King Solomon. Both Leaders: King Solomon he had four hundred chieftains. They go to the footlights with the greatest possible strut. Congregation: We were the chieftains. Both Leaders: You shall be proud again, They stand proudly with arms folded. They walk backward haughtily, laughing on the last lines. From here on the whole production to be much more solemn, elevated, religious. Dazzle the crowd again, Laughing aloud For ten thousand years. Both Leaders: King Solomon he had four hundred shepherds. The leaders go forward to the footlights carrying imaginary torches. Congregation: We were the shepherds. The man and woman pause at the footlights. Both Leaders: You shall have torches bright, They wander over the stage as though looking for lost lambs, with torches held high. Watching the folds by night, Guarding the lambs aright, Ten thousand years. Men's Leader: King Solomon he asked the Queen of Sheba, Bowing most politely: The King kneels, and indicates the entire sky with one long slow gesture. âWhy are the stars so high, There in the velvet sky, Rolling in rivers by, Ten thousand years?â Women's Leader: The Queen of Sheba answered like a lady, Bowing most politely: The Queen kneels opposite the King, and gives the same gesture as she answers. âThey're singing of your kingdom to the angels, They guide your chariot with their lamps and candles, Therefore they burn so farâ So you can drive your car Up where the prophets are, Ten thousand years.â Men's Leader: King Solomon, King Solomon. Both Leaders: King Solomon he kept the Sabbath holy. And spoke with tongues in prophet words so mighty The two stand, commanding the audience. We stamped and whirled and wept and shouted: The man and woman stamp and whirl with great noise and solemnity. Congregation rises and joins in the song: ... âGlory.â We were his people. Both Leaders: You shall be wild and gay, On these two lines, man and woman stamp and whirl again, gravely, magnificently. On these two lines they kneel, commanding the audience. Now they rise and bow to each other and the audience, maintaining a certain intention of benediction. Green trees shall deck your way, Sunday be every day, Ten thousand years. King Solomon, King Solomon. HOW SAMSON BORE AWAY THE GATES OF GAZA A Negro Sermon Once, in a night as black as ink, She drove him out when he would not drink. Round the house there were men in wait Asleep in rows by the Gaza gate. But the Holy Spirit was in this man. Like a gentle wind he crept and ran. (âIt is midnight,â said the big town clock.) He lifted the gates up, post and lock. The hole in the wall was high and wide When he bore away old Gaza's pride Into the deep of the night:â The bold Jack Johnson Israelite,â Samsonâ The Judge, The Nazarite. The air was black, like the smoke of a dragon. Samson's heart was as big as a wagon. He sang like a shining golden fountain. He sweated up to the top of the mountain. He threw down the gates with a noise like judgment. And the quails all ran with the big arousement. But he weptââI must not love tough queens, And spend on them my hard earned means. I told that girl I would drink no more. Therefore she drove me from her door. Oh sorrow! Sorrow! I cannot hide. Oh Lord look down from your chariot side. You made me Judge, and I am not wise. I am weak as a sheep for all my size.â Let Samson Be coming Into your mind. The moon shone out, the stars were gay. He saw the foxes run and play. He rent his garments, he rolled around In deep repentance on the ground. Then he felt a honey in his soul. Grace abounding made him whole. Then he saw the Lord in a chariot blue. The gorgeous stallions whinnied and flew. The iron wheels hummed an old hymn-tune And crunched in thunder over the moon. And Samson shouted to the sky: âMy Lord, my Lord is riding high.â Like a steed, he pawed the gates with his hoof. He rattled the gates like rocks on the roof, And danced in the night On the mountain-top, Danced in the deep of the night: The Judge, the holy Nazarite, Whom ropes and chains could never bind. Let Samson Be coming Into your mind. Whirling his arms, like a top he sped. His long black hair flew round his head Like an outstretched net of silky cord, Like a wheel of the chariot of the Lord. Let Samson Be coming Into your mind. Samson saw the sun anew. He left the gates in the grass and dew. He went to a county-seat a-nigh. Found a harlot proud and high: Philistine that no man could tameâ Delilah was her lady-name. Oh sorrow, Sorrow, She was too wise. She cut off his hair, She put out his eyes. Let Samson Be coming Into your mind. WHEN PETER JACKSON PREACHED IN THE OLD CHURCH (To be sung to the tune of the old negro spiritual âEvery time I feel the spirit moving in my heart I'll prayâ) Peter Jackson was a-preaching And the house was still as snow. He whispered of repentance And the lights were dim and low And were almost out When he gave the first shout: âArise, arise, Cry out your eyes.â And we mourned all our terrible sins away. Clean, clean away. Then we marched around, around, And sang with a wonderful sound:â âEvery time I feel the spirit moving in my heart I'll pray. Every time I feel the spirit moving in my heart I'll pray.â And we fell by the altar And fell by the aisle, And found our Savior In just a little while, We all found Jesus at the break of the day, We all found Jesus at the break of the day. Blessed Jesus, Blessed Jesus. THE CONGO A Study of the Negro Race (Being a memorial to Ray Eldred, a Disciple missionary of the Congo River) I. Their Basic Savagery Fat black bucks in a wine-barrel room, Barrel-house kings, with feet unstable, Sagged and reeled and pounded on the table, A deep rolling bass. Pounded on the table, Beat an empty barrel with the handle of a broom, Hard as they were able, Boom, boom, Boom, With a silk umbrella and the handle of a broom, Boomlay, boomlay, boomlay, Boom. Then I had religion, Then I had a vision. I could not turn from their revel in derision. Then I SAW THE Congo, CREEPING THROUGH THE BLACK, More deliberate. Solemnly chanted. Cutting THROUGH THE FOREST WITH A GOLDEN TRACK. Then along that riverbank A thousand miles Tattooed cannibals danced in files; Then I heard the boom of the blood-lust song And a thigh-bone beating on a tin-pan gong. A rapidly piling climax of speed and racket. And âBloodâ screamed the whistles and the fifes of the warriors, âBloodâ screamed the skull-faced, lean witch-doctors, âWhirl ye the deadly voo-doo rattle, Harry the uplands, Steal all the cattle, Rattle-rattle, rattle-rattle, Bing. Boomlay, boomlay, boomlay, Boom,â A roaring, epic, rag-time tune With a philosophic pause. From the mouth of the Congo To the Mountains of the Moon. Death is an Elephant, Torch-eyed and horrible, Shrilly and with a heavily accented metre. Foam-flanked and terrible. Boom, steal the pygmies, Boom, kill the Arabs, Boom, kill the white men, Hoo, Hoo, Hoo. Listen to the yell of Leopold's ghost Like the wind in the chimney. Burning in Hell for his hand-maimed host. Hear how the demons chuckle and yell Cutting his hands off, down in Hell. Listen to the creepy proclamation, Blown through the lairs of the forest-nation, Blown past the white-ants' hill of clay, Blown past the marsh where the butterflies play:â âBe careful what you do, Or Mumbo-Jumbo, God of the Congo, All the âoâ sounds very golden. Heavy accents very heavy. Light accents very light. Last line whispered. And all of the other Gods of the Congo, Mumbo-Jumbo will hoo-doo you, Mumbo-Jumbo will hoo-doo you, Mumbo-Jumbo will hoo-doo you.â II. Their Irrepressible High Spirits Wild crap-shooters with a whoop and a call Rather shrill and high. Danced the juba in their gambling hall And laughed fit to kill, and shook the town, And guyed the policemen and laughed them down With a boomlay, boomlay, boomlay, Boom. Then I SAW THE Congo, CREEPING THROUGH THE BLACK, Read exactly as in first section. Cutting THROUGH THE FOREST WITH A GOLDEN TRACK. A negro fairyland swung into view, Lay emphasis on the delicate ideas. Keep as light-footed as possible. A minstrel river Where dreams come true. The ebony palace soared on high Through the blossoming trees to the evening sky. The inlaid porches and casements shone With gold and ivory and elephant-bone. And the black crowd laughed till their sides were sore At the baboon butler in the agate door, And the well-known tunes of the parrot band That trilled on the bushes of that magic land. A troupe of skull-faced witch-men came With pomposity. Through the agate doorway in suits of flame, Yea, long-tailed coats with a gold-leaf crust And hats that were covered with diamond-dust. And the crowd in the court gave a whoop and a call And danced the juba from wall to wall. But the witch-men suddenly stilled the throng With a great deliberation and ghostliness. With a stern cold glare, and a stern old song:â âMumbo-Jumbo will hoo-doo you.â ... Just then from the doorway, as fat as shotes, With overwhelming assurance, good cheer, and pomp. Came the cake-walk princes in their long red coats, Canes with a brilliant lacquer shine, And tall silk hats that were red as wine. And they pranced with their butterfly partners there, With growing speed and sharply marked dance-rhythm. Coal-black maidens with pearls in their hair, Knee-skirts trimmed with the jassamine sweet, And bells on their ankles and little blackfeet. And the couples railed at the chant and the frown Of the witch-men lean, and laughed them down. (Oh, rare was the revel, and well worth while That made those glowering witch-men smile.) The cake-walk royalty then began To walk for a cake that was tall as a man To the tune of âBoomlay, boomlay, Boom,â While the witch-men laughed, with a sinister air, With a touch of negro dialect, and as rapidly as possible toward the end. And sang with the scalawags prancing there:â âWalk with care, walk with care, Or Mumbo-Jumbo, God of the Congo, And all of the other Gods of the Congo, Mumbo-Jumbo will hoo-doo you. Beware, beware, walk with care, Boomlay, boomlay, boomlay, boom. Boomlay, boomlay, boomlay, boom. Boomlay, boomlay, boomlay, boom. Boomlay, boomlay, boomlay, Boom.â (Oh rare was the revel, and well worth while Slow philosophic calm. That made those glowering witch-men smile.) III. The Hope of Their Religion A good old negro in the slums of the town Heavy bass. With a literal imitation of camp-meeting racket, and trance. Preached at a sister for her velvet gown. Howled at a brother for his low-down ways, His prowling, guzzling, sneak-thief days. Beat on the Bible till he wore it out Starting the jubilee revival shout. And some had visions, as they stood on chairs, And sang of Jacob, and the golden stairs, And they all repented, a thousand strong From their stupor and savagery and sin and wrong And slammed with their hymn books till they shook the room With âglory, glory, glory,â And âBoom, boom, Boom.â Then I SAW THE Congo, CREEPING THROUGH THE BLACK, Exactly as in the first section. Begin with terror and power, end with joy. Cutting THROUGH THE JUNGLE WITH A GOLDEN TRACK. And the gray sky opened like a new-rent veil And showed the Apostles with their coats of mail. In bright white steele they were seated round And their fire-eyes watched where the Congo wound. And the twelve Apostles, from their thrones on high Thrilled all the forest with their heavenly cry:â âMumbo-Jumbo will die in the jungle; Sung to the tune of âHark, ten thousand harps and voices.â Never again will he hoo-doo you, Never again will he hoo-doo you.â Then along that river, a thousand miles The vine-snared trees fell down in files. With growing deliberation and joy. Pioneer angels cleared the way For a Congo paradise, for babes at play, For sacred capitals, for temples clean. Gone were the skull-faced witch-men lean. There, where the wild ghost-gods had wailed In a rather high keyâas delicately as possible. A million boats of the angels sailed With oars of silver, and prows of blue And silken pennants that the sun shone through. 'Twas a land transfigured, 'twas a new creation. Oh, a singing wind swept the negro nation And on through the backwoods clearing flew:â âMumbo-Jumbo is dead in the jungle. To the tune of âHark, ten thousand harps and voices.â Never again will he hoo-doo you. Never again will he hoo-doo you. Redeemed were the forests, the beasts and the men, And only the vulture dared again By the far, lone mountains of the moon To cry, in the silence, the Congo tune:â Mumbo-Jumbo will hoo-doo you, âMumbo-Jumbo will hoo-doo you. Dying down into a penetrating, terrified whisper. Mumbo ... Jumbo ... will ... hoo-doo ... you.â This poem, particularly the third section, was suggested by an allusion in a sermon by my pastor, F. W. Burnham, to the heroic life and death of Ray Eldred. Eldred was a missionary of the Disciples of Christ who perished while swimming a treacherous branch of the Congo. See A Master Builder on the Congo, by Andrew F. Henesey, published by Fleming H. Revell. SECTION III LITANY OF THE HEROES Being a chant about many men, good and bad, who have led and misled mankind, from the earliest times until now. LITANY OF THE HEROES (Inscribed to George Mather Richards) Would that young Amenophis Fourth returned Prince Hamlet and the Poet Keats in one, Egypt and Israel in History. He mocked at fraud, even his own crown, He loved all classic beauty in the town, He rode abroad to build his lotus tomb, Praising one god, and that one god, the sun. The idol-worshippers chipped out his name From wall and obelisk, to end his fame. Still let that brave, flower-loving King of Time Be throned in your deep hearts, to raise for you The hopes the prince and his mother Thi, well knew, Filling these barren days with Mystery, With Life, and Death, and Immortality, The devouring ages, the triumphant Sun. God keep us brooding on eternal things, God make us wizard-kings. Then let us raise that Egypt-nurtured youth, Son of a Hebrew, with the dauntless scorn And hate for bleating gods Egyptian-born, Showing with signs to stubborn Mizraim âGod is one God, the God of Abraham,â He who in the beginning made the Sun. God send us Moses from his hidden grave, God help us to be brave. Would we were scholars of Confucius' time The Soul of China in History. Watching the feudal China crumbling down, Frightening our master, shaking many a crown, Until he makes more firm the father sages, Restoring custom from the earliest ages With prudent sayings, golden as the sun. Lord, show us safe, august, established ways, Fill us with yesterdays. Would that by Hindu magic we became The Soul of India in History. Dark monks of jewelled India long ago, Sitting at Prince Siddartha's feet to know The foolishness of gold and love and station, The gospel of the Great Renunciation, The ragged cloak, the staff, the rain and sun, The beggar's life, with far Nirvana gleaming: Lord, make us Buddhas, dreaming. Would that the joy of living came to-day, The Classic Spirit. Even as sculptured on Athena's shrine In sunny conclave of serene design, Maidens and men, procession flute and feast, By Phidias, the ivory-hearted priest Of beauty absolute, whose eyes the sun Showed goodlier forms than our desires can guess And more of happiness. Would I might waken in you Alexander, Murdering the nations wickedly, Flooding his time with blood remorselessly, Sowing new Empires, where the Athenian light, Knowledge and music, slay the Asian night, And men behold Apollo in the sun. God make us splendid, though by grievous wrong. God make us fierce and strong. Would I might rouse the CÃ¦sar in you all (That which men hail as king, and bow them down), Till you are crowned, or you refuse the crown. Would I might wake the valor and the pride, The eagle soul with which he soared and died, Entering grandly then the fearful grave. God help us build the world, like master-men, God help us to be brave. Behold the Pharisees, proud, rich, and damned, Great Art and Letters in History. Boasting themselves in lost Jerusalem, Gathered a weeping woman to condemn, Then watching curiously, without a sound The God of Mercy, writing on the ground. How looked his sunburned face beneath the sun Flushed with his Father's mighty angel-wine? God make us all divine. Would I might free St. Paul, singing in chains In your deep hearts. New heavenly love shall fight And slay the subtle gods of Greek delight And dreadful Roman gods, and light the world With words of flame, till those false powers are hurled Burning to ashes in the avenging grave. âSt. Paulâ our battle-cry, and faith our shield, God help us to be brave. Yea, give the world no peace, till all men kneel, Seeking with tears the grace of Christ our God. Make us like Augustine beneath Thy rod. Give us no other joy but Thy repentance, Thunder our just, hereditary sentence Till shame and fear of Hell blot out the sun. Christ help us hold Thy blood-redemption dear. Christ, give us holy fear. Nay, let us have the marble peace of Rome, The Secular Spirit in History. Recorded in the Code Justinian, Till Pagan Justice shelters man from man. Fanatics snarl like mongrel dogs; the code Will build each custom like a Roman Road, Direct as daylight, clear-eyed as the sun. God grant all crazy world-disturbers cease. God give us honest peace. Would that on horses swifter than desire The World-Spirit of Islam. We rode behind Mohammed 'round the zones With swords unceasing, sowing fields of bones, Till New America, ancient Mizraim, Cry: âAllah is the God of Abraham.â God make our host relentless as the sun, Each soul your spear, your banner and your slave, God help us to be brave. Would I might wake St. Francis in you all, The Medieval Spirit in History. Brother of birds and trees, God's Troubadour, Blinded with weeping for the sad and poor; Our wealth undone, all strict Franciscan men, Come, let us chant the canticle again Of mother earth and the enduring sun. God make each soul the lonely leper's slave; God make us saints, and brave. Would we were lean and grim, and shaken with hate Like Dante, fugitive, o'er-wrought with cares, And climbing bitterly the stranger's stairs, Yet Love, Love, Love, divining: finding still Beyond dark Hell the penitential hill, And blessed Beatrice beyond the grave. Jehovah lead us through the wilderness: God make our wandering brave. Would that we had the fortunes of Columbus. Sailing his caravels a trackless way, He found a Universeâhe sought Cathay. God give such dawns as when, his venture o'er, The Sailor looked upon San Salvador. God lead us past the setting of the sun To wizard islands, of august surprise; God make our blunders wise. Would that such hills and cities round us sang, Religion in History. Such vistas of the actual earth and man As kindled Titian when his life began; Would that this latter Greek could put his gold, Wisdom and splendor in our brushes bold Till Greece and Venice, children of the sun, Become our everyday, and we aspire To colors fairer far, and glories higher. Would I might wake in you the whirlwind soul Of Michelangelo, who hewed the stone And Night and Day revealed, whose arm alone Could draw the face of God, the titan high Whose genius smote like lightning from the skyâ And shall he mold like dead leaves in the grave? Nay, he is in us! Let us dare and dare. God help us to be brave. Would that in body and spirit Shakespeare came Visible emperor of the deeds of Time, With Justice still the genius of his rhyme, Giving each man his due, each passion grace, Impartial as the rain from Heaven's face Or sunshine from the Heaven-enthroned sun. Sweet Swan of Avon, come to us again. Teach us to write, and writing, to be men. Would we were blind with Milton, and we sang With him of uttermost Heaven in a new song, That men might see again the angel-throng, And newborn hopes, true to this age, would rise, Pictures to make men weep for paradise, All glorious things beyond the defeated grave. God smite us blind, and give us bolder wings; God help us to be brave. Would that the cold adventurous Corsican The Napoleonic Ideal in History. Woke with new hope of glory, strong from sleep, Instructed how to conquer and to keep More justly, having dreamed awhile, yea crowned With shining flowers, God-given; while the sound Of singing continents, following the sun, Calls freeborn men to guard Napoleon's throne Who makes the eternal hopes of man his own. Would that the dry hot wind called Science came, The Eye of Science in History. Forerunner of a higher mystic day, Though vile machine-made commerce clear the wayâ Though nature losing shame should lose her veil, And ghosts of buried angel-warriors wail The fall of Heaven, and the relentless Sun Smile on, as Abraham's God forever diesâ Lord, give us Darwin's eyes! Would I might rouse the Lincoln in you all, The American Spirit in History. That which is gendered in the wilderness From lonely prairies and God's tenderness. Imperial soul, star of a weedy stream, Born where the ghosts of buffaloes still gleam, Whose spirit hoof-beats storm above his grave, Above that breast of earth and prairie-fireâ Fire that freed the slave. Then let us seek out shining Emerson Teacher of Whitman, and better priest of man, The self-reliant granite American. Give us his Heaven-sent right to strike and spare, Give us the wools and hair-shirts prophets wear, Then Adam's freedom in the Eden-sun. God help us make each state an Eden-flower, And blaze long trails to power. These were the spacious days of Roosevelt. Would that among you chiefs like him arose To win the wrath of our united foes, To chain King Mammon in the donjon-keep, To rouse our godly citizens that sleep Till, as one soul, we shout up to the sun The battle-yell of freedom and the rightâ âLord, let good men unite.â Nay, I would have you lonely and despised. Statesmen whom only statesmen understand, Artists whom only artists can command, Sages whom all but sages scorn, whose fame Dies down in lies, in synonyms for shame With the best populace beneath the sun. God give us tasks that martyrs can revere, Still too much hated to be whispered here. Yea, I would have you like stern Woodrow Wilson The Conclusion and the Ultimate and Final Heroes of This Song: Wilson and Socrates. Drinking his cup, as such proud men have done Since Amenophis Fourth addressed the sun. Staking his last strength and his final fight That cost him all, to set the old world right. The League of Nations course is yet to run. The Idol-worshippers would end its fame, And cut from every wall its builder's name. Would we might drink, with knowledge high and kind, The hemlock cup of Socrates the king, Knowing right well we know not anything, With full life done, bowing before the law, Binding young thinkers' hearts with loyal awe, And fealty fixed as the ever-enduring sunâ God let us live, seeking the highest light, God help us die aright. Nay, I would have you grand, and still forgotten, Hid like the stars at noon, as he who set The Egyptian magic of man's alphabet; Or that Egyptian, first to dream in pain That dauntless souls cannot by death be slainâ Conquering for all men then, the fearful grave. God keep us hid, yet vaster far than death. God help us to be brave. SECTION IV VERSES OF AN ESPECIALLY INSCRIPTIONAL CHARACTER Being songs of my art-student days, written for my drawings. Most of the drawings are the property of citizens of Springfield, Illinois THE QUEEN OF BUBBLES (Written for a picture) The Youth speaks:â âWhy do you seek the sun In your bubble-crown ascending? Your chariot will melt to mist. Your crown will have an ending.â The Goddess replies:â âNay, sun is but a bubble, Earth is a whiff of foamâ To my caves on the coast of Thule Each night I call them home. Thence Faiths blow forth to angels And loves blow forth to menâ They break and turn to nothing And I make them whole again. On the crested waves of chaos I ride them back reborn: New stars I bring at evening For those that burst at morn; My soul is the wind of Thule And evening is the signâ The sun is but a bubble, A fragile child of mine.â GHOSTS IN LOVE âTell me, where do ghosts in love Find their bridal veils?â âIf you and I were ghosts in love We'd climb the cliffs of Mystery, Above the Sea that Wails, I'd trim your gray and streaming hair With veils of Fantasy From the tree of Memory. 'Tis there the ghosts that fall in love Find their bridal veils.â COLD SUNBEAMS The Question: âTell me, where do fairy queens Find their bridal veils?â The Answer: âIf you were now a fairy queen Then I, your faithless page and bold Would win the realm by winning you. Your veil would be transparent gold White magic spiders wove for you At cold gray dawn, from sunbeams cold While robins sang amid the dew.â SWEETHEARTS OF THE YEAR Sweetheart Spring Our Sweetheart, Spring, came softly, Her gliding hands were fire, Her lilac breath upon our cheeks Consumed us with desire. By her our God began to build, Began to sow and till. He laid foundations in our loves For every good and ill. We asked Him not for blessing, We asked Him not for painâ Still, to the just and unjust He sent His fire and rain. Sweetheart Summer We prayed not, yet she came to us, The silken, shining one, On Jacob's noble ladder Descended from the sun. She reached our town of Every Day, Our dry and dusty sodâ We prayed not, yet she brought to us The misty wine of God. Sweetheart Autumn The woods were black and crimson, The frost-bit flowers were dead, But Sweetheart Indian Summer came With love-winds round her head. While fruits God-given and splendid Belonged to her domain: Baskets of corn in perfect ear And grapes with purple stain, The treacherous winds persuaded her Spring Love was in the wood Altho' the end of love was hersâ Fruition, Motherhood. Sweetheart Winter We had done naught of service To win our Maker's praise. Yet Sweetheart Winter came to us To gild our waning days. Down Jacob's winding ladder She came from Sunshine Town, Bearing the sparkling mornings And clouds of silver-brown; Bearing the seeds of Springtime. Upon her snowy seas Bearing the fairy star-flowers For baby Christmas trees. SWEET BRIARS OF THE STAIRWAYS We are happy all the time Even when we fight: Sweet briars of the stairways, Gay fairies of the grime; We, who are playing to-night. âOur feet are in the gutters, Our eyes are sore with dust, But still our eyes are bright. The wide street roars and muttersâ We know it works because it mustâ We, who are playing to-night! âDirt is everlasting.âWe never, never fear it. Toil is never-ceasing.âWe will play until we near it. Tears are never-ending.âWhen once real tears have come; âWhen we see our people as they areâ Our fathersâbroken, dumbâ Our mothersâbroken, dumbâ The weariest of women and of men; Ahâthen our eyes will lose their lightâ Then we will never play againâ We, who are playing to-night.â THE SORCERESS! I asked her, âIs Aladdin's lamp Hidden anywhere?â âLook into your heart,â she said, âAladdin's lamp is there.â She took my heart with glowing hands. It burned to dust and air And smoke and rolling thistledown Blowing everywhere. âFollow the thistledown,â she said, âTill doomsday, if you dare, Over the hills and far away. Aladdin's lamp is there.â THE AMARANTH Ah, in the night, all music haunts me here. ... Is it for naught high Heaven cracks and yawns And the tremendous Amaranth descends Sweet with the glory of ten thousand dawns? Does it not mean my God would have me say:â âWhether you will or no, O city young, Heaven will bloom like one great flower for you, Flash and loom greatly all your marts amongâ? Friends, I will not cease hoping though you weep. Such things I see, and some of them shall come, Though now or streets are harsh and ashen-gray, Though our strong youths are strident now, or dumb. Friends, that sweet town, that wonder-town, shall rise. Naught can delay it. Though it may not be Just as I dream, it comes at last I know, With streets like channels of an incense-sea. AN APOLOGY FOR THE BOTTLE VOLCANIC Sometimes I dip my pen and find the bottle full of fire, The salamanders flying forth I cannot but admire. It's Etna, or Vesuvius, if those big things were small, And then 'tis but itself again, and does not smoke at all. And so my blood grows cold. I say, âThe bottle held but ink, And, if you thought it otherwise, the worser for your think.â And then, just as I throw my scribbled paper on the floor, The bottle says, âFe, fi, fo, fum,â and steams and shouts some more. O sad, deceiving ink, as bad as liquor in its wayâ All demons of a bottle size have pranced from you to-day, And seized my pen for hobby-horse as witches ride a broom, And left a trail of brimstone words and blots and gobs of gloom. And yet when I am extra good and say my prayers at night, And mind my ma, and do the chores, and speak to folks polite, My bottle spreads a rainbow-mist, and from the vapor fine Ten thousands troops from fairyland come riding in a line. I've seen them on their chargers race around my study chair, They opened wide the window and rode forth upon the air. The army widened as it went, and into myriads grew, O how the lances shimmered, how the silvery trumpets blew! THE VILLAGE IMPROVEMENT PARADE Guns salute, and crowds and pigeons fly, Bronzed, Homeric bards go striding by, Shouting âGloryâ amid the cannonade:â It is the cross-roads Resurrection Parade. Actors, craftsmen, builders, join the throng, Painters, sculptors, florists tramp along, Farm-boys prance, in tinsel tin and jade:â It is the cross-roads Love and Laughter Crusade. The sun is blazing big as all the sky, The mustard-plant with the sunflower climbing high, With the Indian corn in fiery plumes arrayed:â It is the cross-roads Love and Beauty Crusade. Free and proud and mellow jamboree, Roar and foam upon the prairie sea, Tom turkeys sing the sun a serenade:â It is the cross-roads Resurrection Parade. Our sweethearts dance, with wands as white as milk, With veils of gold and robes of silver silk, Their caps in velvet pansy-patterns made:â It is the cross-roads Resurrection Parade. Wandering round the shrines we understand, Waving oak-boughs cheap and close at hand, And field-flowers fair, for which no man has paid:â It is the cross-roads Love and Beauty Crusade. Hieroglyphic marchers here we bring. Rich inscriptions strut and talk and sing. A scroll to read, a picture-word brigade:â It is the cross-roads Love and Laughter Crusade. Swans for symbols deck the banners rare, Mighty acorn-signs command the air, For hearts of oak, by flying beauty swayed:â It is the cross-roads Resurrection Parade. The flags are big, like rainbows flashing round, They spread like sails, and lift us from the ground, Star-born ships, that have come in masquerade:â It is the cross-roads Resurrection Parade. THE FAIRY FROM THE APPLE-SEED O apple-seed I planted in a silly shallow place In a bowl of wrought silver, with Sangamon earth within it, O baby tree that came, without an apple or it, A tree that grew a tiny height, but thickened on apace, With bossy glossy arms, and leaves of trembling lace. One night the trunk was rent, and the heavy bowl rocked round, The boughs were bending here and there, with a curious locust sound, And a tiny dryad came, from out the doll tree, And held the boughs in ivory hands, And waved her black hair round, And climbed, and ate with merry words The sudden fruit it bore. And in the leaves she hides and sings And guards my study door. She guards it like a watchdog true And robbers run away. Her eyes are lifted spears all night, But dove-eyes in the day. And she is stranger, stronger Than the funny human race. Lovelier her form, and holier her face. She feeds me flowers and fruit With a quaint grace. She dresses in the apple-leaves As delicate as lace. This girl that came from Sangamon earth In a bowl of silver bright From an apple-seed I planted in a silly shallow place. DANCING FOR A PRIZE Three fairies by the Sangamon Were dancing for a prize. The rascals were alike indeed As they danced with drooping eyes. I gave the magic acorn To the one I loved the best, The imp that made me think of her My heart's eternal guest, My lady of the tea-rose, my lady far away, Queen of the fleets of No-Man's-Land That sail to old Cathay. How did the trifler hint of her? Ah, when the dance was done They begged me for the acorn, Laughing every one. Two had eyes of midnight, And one had golden eyes, And I gave the golden acorn To the scamp with golden eyes. Confessor Dandelion, My priest so gray and wise, Whispered when I gave it To the girl with golden eyes: âShe is like your Queen of Glory On China's holy strand Who drove the coiling dragons Like doves before her hand.â THE SOUL OF THE CITY RECEIVES THE GIFT OF THE HOLY SPIRIT (A broadside distributed in Springfield, Illinois) Censers are swinging Over the town; Censers are swinging, Look overhead! Censers are swinging, Heaven comes down. City, dead city, Awake from the dead! Censers, tremendous, Gleam overhead. Wind-harps are ringing, Wind-harps unseenâ Calling and calling:â âWake from the dead. Rise, little city, Shine like a queen.â Soldiers of Christ For battle grow keen. Heaven-sent winds Haunt alley and lane. Singing of life In town-meadows green After the toil And battle and pain. Incense is pouring Like the spring rain Down on the mob That moil through the street. Blessed are they Who behold it and gain Power made more mighty Thro' every defeat. Builders, toil on. Make all complete. Make Springfield wonderful. Make her renown Worthy this day, Till, at God's feet, Tranced, saved forever, Waits the white town. Censers are swinging Over the town, Censers gigantic! Look overhead! Hear the winds singing:â âHeaven comes down. City, dead city, Awake from the dead.â THE ANGEL AND THE CLOWN I saw wild domes and bowers And smoking incense towers And mad exotic flowers In Illinois. Where ragged ditches ran Now springs of Heaven began Celestial drink for man In Illinois. There stood beside the town Beneath its incense-crown An angel and a clown In Illinois. He was as Clowns are: She was snow and star With eyes that looked afar In Illinois. I asked, âHow came this place Of antique Asian grace Amid our callow race In Illinois?â Said Clown and Angel fair: âBy laughter and by prayer, By casting off all care In Illinois.â THE SONG OF THE STURDY SNAILS Gristly bare-bone fingers On my window-paneâ The drumbeat of a ghost Louder than the rain! Oh frail, storm-shaken hutâ No candle, not a spark Of fire within the grate. Oh the lonely dark! Trembling by the window I watched the lightning flash And saw the little villains Upon the outer sash And other small musicians Upon the window-paneâ Garden snails, a-dragging Their shells amid the rain! The thunder blew away. My happiness began. Over the dripping darkness Rills of moonlight ran. In the silence rich The scratching of the shells Became a crooning music A lazy peal of bells. So fearless in the night My sluggard brothers bold! Your fancies swift and glowing; Your footsteps slow and cold! My happy beggar brothers Tuning all together Playing on the pane Praise of stormy weather! Upon a ragged pillow At last I laid my head And watched the sparkling window, And the wan light on my bed. Through the glass came flying Dream snails, with leafy wingsâ Glided on the moonbeamsâ And all the snails were kings! With crowns of pollen yellow And eyes of firefly gold Beholdâto crooning music Their coiling wings unrolled! These tiny kings I saw Reigning over white Bisque jars of fairy flowers In sturdy proud delight. These jars in fairyland Await good snails that keep Vigils on the windows Of beggars fast asleep. THE WEDDING OF THE ROSE AND THE LOTUS (A poem distributed to both houses of Congress by Secretary Franklin K. Lane on the opening day of the Panama-Pacific Exposition.) Flags of the Pacific And the Atlantic meet, Captain calls to captain, Fleet makes cheer with fleet. Above the drownÃ¨d ages A wind of wooing blows:â The red rose woos the lotus, The lotus woos the rose ... The lotus conquered Egypt. The rose was loved in Rome. Great India crowned the lotus: (Britain the rose's home). Old China crowned the lotus, They crowned it in Japan. But Christendom adored the rose Ere Christendom began ... The lotus speaks of slumber: The rose is as a dart. The lotus is Nirvana: The rose is Mary's heart. The rose is deathless, restless, The splendor of our pain: The flush and fire of labor That builds, not all in vain. ... The genius of the lotus Shall heal earth's too-much fret. The rose, in blinding glory, Shall waken Asia yet. Hail to their loves, ye peoples! Behold, a world-wind blows, That aids the ivory lotus To wed the red, red rose! THE TREE OF LAUGHING BELLS, OR THE WINGS OF THE MORNING A Poem for Aviators How the Wings Were Made From many morning-glories That in an hour will fade, From many pansy buds Gathered in the shade, From lily of the valley And dandelion buds, From fiery poppy-buds Are the Wings of the Morning made. The Indian Girl Who Made Them These, the Wings of the Morning, An Indian Maiden wove, Intertwining subtlely Wands from a willow grove Beside the Sangamonâ Rude stream of Dreamland Town. She bound them to my shoulders With fingers golden-brown. The wings were part of me; The willow-wands were hot. Pulses from my heart Healed each bruise and spot Of the morning-glory buds, Beginning to unfold Beneath her burning song of suns untold. The Indian Girl Tells the Hero Where to Go to Get the Laughing Bell âTo the farthest star of all, Go, make a moment's raid. To the westâescape the earth Before your pennons fade! West! west! o'ertake the night That flees the morning sun. There's a path between the starsâ A black and silent one. Oh, tremble when you near The smallest star that sings: Only the farthest star Is cool for willow wings. âThere's a sky within the westâ There's a sky beyond the skies Where only one star shinesâ The Star of Laughing Bellsâ In Chaos-land it lies; Cold as morning-dew, A gray and tiny boat Moored on Chaos-shore, Where nothing else can float But the Wings of the Morning strong And the lilt of laughing song From many a ruddy throat: âFor the Tree of Laughing Bells Grew from a bleeding seed Planted mid enchantment Played on a harp and reed: Darkness was the harpâ Chaos-wind the reed; The fruit of the tree is a bell, blood-redâ The seed was the heart of a fairy, dead. Part of the bells of the Laughing Tree Fell to-day at a blast from the reed. Bring a fallen bell to me. Go!â the maiden said. âFor the bell will quench our memory, Our hope, Our borrowed sorrow; We will have no thirst for yesterday, No thought for to-morrow.â The Journey Starts Swiftly A thousand times ten thousand times More swift than the sun's swift light Were the Morning Wings in their flight OnâOnâ West of the Universe, Thro' the West To Chaos-night. He Nears the Goal How the red bells rang As I neared the Chaos-shore! As I flew across to the end of the West The young bells rang and rang Above the Chaos roar, And the Wings of the Morning Beat in tune And bore me like a bird alongâ And the nearing star turned to a moonâ Gray moon, with a brow of redâ Gray moon with a golden song. Like a diver after pearls I plunged to that stifling floor. It was wide as a giant's wheat-field An icy, wind-washed shore. O laughing, proud, but trembling star! O wind that wounded sore! He Climbs the Hill Where the Tree Grows Onâ Thro' the gleaming gray I ran to the storm and clangâ To the red, red hill where the great tree swayedâ And scattered bells like autumn leaves. How the red bells rang! My breath within my breast Was held like a diver's breathâ The leaves were tangled locks of grayâ The boughs of the tree were white and gray, Shaped like scythes of Death. The boughs of the tree would sweep and swayâ Sway like scythes of Death. But it was beautiful! I knew that all was well. A thousand bells from a thousand boughs Each moment bloomed and fell. On the hill of the wind-swept tree There were no bells asleep; They sang beneath my training wings Like rivers sweet and steep. Deep rock-clefts before my feet Mighty chimes did keep And little choirs did keep. He Receives the Bells Honeyed, small and fair, Like flowers, in flowery landsâ Like little maiden's handsâ Two bells fell in my hair, Two bells caressed my hair. I pressed them to my purple lips In the strangling Chaos-air. He Starts on the Return Journey On desperate wings and strong, Two bells within my breast, I breathed again, I breathed againâ West of the Universeâ West of the skies of the West. Into the black toward home, And never a star in sight, By Faith that is blind I took my way With my two bosomed blossoms gay Till a speck in the East was the Milky Way: Till starlit was the night. And the bells had quenched all memoryâ All hopeâ All borrowed sorrow: I had no thirst for yesterday, No thought for to-morrow. Like hearts within my breast The bells would throb to me And down the siren stars That sang enticingly; My heart became a bellâ Three bells were in my breast, Three hearts to comfort me. We reached the daytime happilyâ We reached the earth with glee. In an hour, in an hour it was done! The wings in their morning flight Were a thousand times ten thousand times More swift than beams of light. He Gives What He Won to the Indian Girl I panted in the grassy wood; I kissed the Indian Maid As she took my wings from me: With all the grace I could I gave two throbbing bells to her From the foot of the Laughing Tree. And one she pressed to her golden breast And one, gave back to me. From Lilies of the valleyâ See them fade. From poppy-blooms all frayed, From dandelions gray with care, From pansy-faces, worn and torn, From morning-gloriesâ See them fadeâ From all things fragile, faint and fair Are the Wings of the Morning made! Note: My painting of The Tree of Laughing Bells is hung on the mezzanine floor of the Davenport Hotel, Spokane, Washington, in the midst of the one thousand famous singing birds brought from all over the world by Louis M. Davenport. This recent honor I count a singularly fortunate interpretation of the symbolism of the painting. THE SPIDER AND THE GHOST OF THE FLY Once I loved a spider When I was born a fly, A velvet-footed spider With a gown of rainbow-dye. She ate my wings and gloated. She bound me with a hair. She drove me to her parlor Above her winding stair. To educate young spiders She took me all apart. My ghost came back to haunt her. I saw her eat my heart. CRICKETS ON A STRIKE The foolish queen of fairyland From her milk-white throne in a lily-bell, Gave command to her cricket-band To play for her when the dew-drops fell. But the cold dew spoiled their instruments And they play for the foolish queen no more. Instead those sturdy malcontents Play sharps and flats in my kitchen floor. THE VISIT TO MAB When glad vacation time began A snail-king said to his dear spouse, âCome, let us lock our birch-bark house And visit some important man. âEach summer we have hoped to go To see the sultan Gingerbread Who wears chopped citron on his head And currant love-locks in a row. âAnd see his vizier Chocolate Bill And Popcorn Man, his pale young priest. They live twelve inches to the east Behind the lofty brown-bread hill.â His wife said: âSimple elegance Is what we want. It is the mode To take the little western road To where the blue-grass fairies dance. âI think the queen will recognize Our atmosphere of wealth and ease. My steel-gray shell is sure to please, And she will fear your fiery eyes.â And so they visited proud Mab. The firs were laughing overhead, The chattering roses burned deep-red. The snails were queer and dumb and drab. The contrast made them quite the thing. A setting spells success at times. Mab gave the queen a book of rhymes. A tissue-cap she gave the king. Like caps the children wear for sport. And vainer than he well could say He called gay Mab his âpride and stay,â With pompous speeches to the court. They journeyed home, made young indeed, But opening the book of song Each poem looked so deep and long They could not bear to start to read. TO LADY JANE (Written for Miss Jane Brown on her birthday) Romance was always young. You come to-day Just eight years old With marvellous dark hair. Younger than Dante found you When you turned His heart into the way That found the heavenly stair. Perhaps we must be strangers. I confess My soul this hour is Dante's, And your care Should be for dolls Whose painted hands caress Your marvellous dark hair. Romance, with moonflower face And morning eyes, And lips whose thread of scarlet prophesies The canticles of a coming king unknown, Remember, when you join him On his throne, Even me, your far-off troubadour, And wear For me some trifling rose Beneath your veil, Dying a royal death, Happy and pale, Choked by the passion, The wonder and the snare, The glory and despair That still will haunt and own Your marvellous dark hair. INDIAN SUMMER. LITTLE LEAVES ARE BURNING IN THE STREET: AND LITTLE FLAMES LIE HEARTS UPON THEM BEAT. THE SMOKE GOES HIGH ABOVE THE TREE-TOPS BARE. WHITE SMOKE AND GREY NOW MAKE THE CITY FAIR. OH SPICY SMOKE, THE LITTLE BOYS DELIGHT! YOU BLESS HIS DAYS. AND MAKE HIM HOPE FOR NIGHT. FOR NIGHT-FIRES OF THE GUTTERS, BURNING BRIGHT. AN INDIAN SUMMER DAY ON THE PRAIRIE In the Beginning The sun is a huntress young, The sun is a red, red joy, The sun is an Indian girl, Of the tribe of the Illinois. Mid-Morning The sun is a smoldering fire, That creeps through the high gray plain, And leaves not a bush of cloud To blossom with flowers of rain. Noon The sun is a wounded deer, That treads pale grass in the skies, Shaking his golden horns, Flashing his baleful eyes. Sunset The sun is an eagle old, There in the windless west. Atop of the spirit-cliffs He builds him a crimson nest. QUEEN MAB IN THE VILLAGE Once I loved a fairy, Queen Mab it was. Her voice Was like a little Fountain That bids the birds rejoice. Her face was wise and solemn, Her hair was brown and fine. Her dress was pansy velvet, A butterfly design. To see her hover round me Or walk the hills of air, Awakened love's deep pulses And boyhood's first despair; A passion like a sword-blade That pierced me thro' and thro': Her fingers healed the sorrow Her whisper would renew. We sighed and reigned and feasted Within a hollow tree, We vowed our love was boundless, Eternal as the sea. She banished from her kingdom The mortal boy I grewâ So tall and crude and noisy, I killed grasshoppers too. I threw big rocks at pigeons, I plucked and tore apart The weeping, wailing daisies, And broke my lady's heart. At length I grew to manhood, I scarcely could believe I ever loved the lady, Or caused her court to grieve, Until a dream came to me, One bleak first night of Spring, Ere tides of apple blossoms Rolled in o'er everything, While rain and sleet and snowbanks Were still a-vexing men, Ere robin and his comrades Were nesting once again. I saw Mab's Book of Judgmentâ Its clasps were iron and stone, Its leaves were mammoth ivory, Its boards were mammoth bone,â Hid in her seaside mountains, Forgotten or unkept, Beneath its mighty covers Her wrath against me slept. And deeply I repented Of brash and boyish crime, Of murder of things lovely Now and in olden time. I cursed my vain ambition, My would-be worldly days, And craved the paths of wonder, Of dewy dawns and fays. I cried, âOur love was boundless, Eternal as the sea, O Queen, reverse the sentence, Come back and master me!â The book was by the cliff-side Upon its edge upright. I laid me by it softly, And wept throughout the night. And there at dawn I saw it, No book now, but a door, Upon its panels written, âJudgment is no more.â The bolt flew back with thunder, I saw within that place A mermaid wrapped in seaweed With Mab's immortal face, Yet grown now to a woman, A woman to the knee. She cried, she clasped me fondly, We soon were in the sea. Ah, she was wise and subtle, And gay and strong and sleek, We chained the wicked swordfish, We played at hide and seek. We floated on the water, We heard the dawn-wind sing, I made from ocean-wonders, Her bridal wreath and ring. All mortal girls were shadows, All earth-life but a mist, When deep beneath the maelstrom, The mermaid's heart I kissed. I woke beside the church-door Of our small inland town, Bowing to a maiden In a pansy-velvet gown, Who had not heard of fairies, Yet seemed of love to dream. We planned an earthly cottage Beside an earthly stream. Our wedding long is over, With toil the years fill up, Yet in the evening silence, We drink a deep-sea cup. Nothing the fay remembers, Yet when she turns to me, We meet beneath the whirlpool, We swim the golden sea. THE MYSTERIOUS CAT (A chant for a children's pantomime dance, suggested by a picture painted by George Mather Richards) I saw a proud, mysterious cat, I saw a proud, mysterious cat, Too proud to catch a mouse or ratâ Mew, mew, mew. But catnip she would eat, and purr, But catnip, she would eat, and purr. And goldfish she did much preferâ Mew, mew, mew. I saw a catâ'twas but a dream, I saw a catâ'twas but a dream Who scorned the slave that brought her creamâ Mew, mew, mew. Unless the slave were dressed in style, Unless the slave were dressed in style, And knelt before her all the whileâ Mew, mew, mew. Did you ever hear of a thing like that? Did you ever hear of a thing like that? Did you ever hear of a thing like that? Oh, what a proud mysterious cat. Oh, what a proud mysterious cat. Oh, what a proud mysterious cat. Mew ... mew ... mew. THE HUMBLE BUMBLE BEE. THE WEATHER-MAN HAS PROMISED SNOW AND SLEET. NOW BUMBLE-BEE. WHERE WILL YOU WARM YOUR FEET? âBESIDE THE SANGAMON A HOLLOW OAK HAS BEEN MY WINTER WIGWAM; 'TIS THE CLOAK THAT SHIELDS THE INDIAN FAIRIES AND THEIR KING: THEY SLEEP ON MOUSE-HIDES IN A RAINBOW RING OF BEES IN WAR-PAINT. CROUCHED IN THICK ARRAY. WHO SCARE THE CUT-WORMS AND THE ANTS AWAY. I LEAD THOSE BRAVES COMMANDING THEM TO KNEEL AND BUZZ, AS ON THEIR WINGS I PUT MY HEEL. IN WINTER, FAIRYLAND BELONGS TO ME. IN SUMMER I'M A HUMBLE BUMBLE-BEE. SECTION V MOON-POEMS TO GLORIANA Girl with the burning golden eyes, And red-bird song, and snowy throat: I bring you gold and silver moons, And diamond stars, and mists that float. I bring you moons and snowy clouds, I bring you prairie skies to-night To feebly praise your golden eyes And red-bird song, and throat so white. EUCLID Old Euclid drew a circle On a sand-beach long ago. He bounded and enclosed it With angles thus and so. His set of solemn graybeards Nodded and argued much Of arc and of circumference, Diameter and such. A silent child stood by them From morning until noon Because they drew such charming Round pictures of the moon. THE HAUGHTY SNAIL-KING (What Uncle William Told the Children) Twelve snails went walking after night. They'd creep an inch or so, Then stop and bug their eyes And blow. Some folks ... are ... deadly .. slow. Twelve snails went walking yestereve, Led by their fat old king. They were so dull their princeling had No sceptre, robe or ringâ Only a paper cap to wear When nightly journeying. This king-snail said: âI feel a thought Within ... It blossoms soon. ... O little courtiers of mine, ... I crave a pretty boon. ... Oh, yes ... (High thoughts with effort come And well-bred snails are ALMOST dumb.) âI wish I had a yellow crown As glistering ... as ... the moon.â WHAT THE RATTLESNAKE SAID The moon's a little prairie-dog. He shivers through the night. He sits upon his hill and cries For fear that I will bite. The sun's a broncho. He's afraid Like every other thing, And trembles, morning, noon and night, Lest I should spring, and sting. DRYING THEIR WINGS (What the Carpenter Said) The moon's a cottage with a door. Some folks can see it plain. Look, you may catch a glint of light, A sparkle through the pane, Showing the place is brighter still Within, though bright without. There, at a cosy open fire Strange babes are grouped about. The children of the wind and tideâ The urchins of the sky, Drying their wings from storms and things So they again can fly. WHAT THE GRAY-WINGED FAIRY SAID The moon's a gong, hung in the wild, Whose song the fays hold dear. Of course you do not hear it, child. It takes a FAIRY ear. The full moon is a splendid gong That beats as night grows still. It sounds above the evening song Of dove or whippoorwill. A SENSE OF HUMOR No man should stand before the moon To make sweet song thereon, With dandified importance, His sense of humor gone. Nay, let us don the motley cap, The jester's chastened mien, If we would woo that looking-glass And see what should be seen. O mirror on fair Heaven's wall, We find there what we bring. So, let us smile in honest part And deck our souls and sing. Yea, by the chastened jest alone Will ghosts and terrors pass, And fays, or suchlike friendly things, Throw kisses through the glass. WHAT THE CLOWN SAID âThe moon's a paper jumping hoop,â Went on the circus clown, âA film of gilded nonsense For the games of Angel-town. âIf I could break those horses That gallop through my sleep, I'd reach that aggravating hoop And make my finest leap. âI climb upon their backs, and ride, But always slip too soon ... And fall and wake, when just one mile Remains to reach the moon.â ON THE GARDEN WALL Oh, once I walked a garden In dreams. 'Twas yellow grass. And many orange-trees grew there In sand as white as glass. The curving, wide wall-border Was marble, like the snow. I walked that wall a fairy-prince And, pacing quaint and slow, Beside me were my pages, Two giant, friendly birds. Half swan they were, half peacock. They spake in courtier-words. Their inner wings a chariot, Their outer wings for flight, They lifted me from dreamland. We bade those trees good-night. Swiftly above the stars we rode. I looked below me soon. The white-walled garden I had ruled Was one lone flowerâthe moon. WRITTEN FOR A MUSICIAN Hungry for music with a desperate hunger I prowled abroad, I threaded through the town; The evening crowd was clamoring and drinking, Vulgar and pitifulâmy heart bowed downâ Till I remembered duller hours made noble By strangers clad in some surprising grace. Wait, wait, my soul, your music comes ere midnight Appearing in some unexpected place With quivering lips, and gleaming, moonlit face. THE MOON IS A PAINTER He coveted her portrait. He toiled as she grew gay. She loved to see him labor In that devoted way. And in the end it pleased her, But bowed him more with care. Her rose-smile showed so plainly, Her soul-smile was not there. That night he groped without a lamp To find a cloak, a book, And on the vexing portrait By moonrise chanced to look. The color scheme was out of key, The maiden rose-smile faint, But through the blessed darkness She gleamed, his friendly saint. The comrade, white, immortal, His bride, and more than brideâ The citizen, the sage of mind, For whom he lived and died. THE ENCYCLOPÃDIA âIf I could set the moon upon This table,â said my friend, âAmong the standard poets And brochures without end, And noble prints of old Japan, How empty they would seem, By that encyclopÃ¦dia Of whim and glittering dream.â WHAT THE MINER IN THE DESERT SAID The moon's a brass-hooped water-keg, A wondrous water-feast. If I could climb the ridge and drink And give drink to my beast; If I could drain that keg, the flies Would not be biting so, My burning feet be spry again, My mule no longer slow. And I could rise and dig for ore, And reach my fatherland, And not be food for ants and hawks And perish in the sand. WHAT THE COAL-HEAVER SAID The moon's an open furnace door Where all can see the blast, We shovel in our blackest griefs, Upon that grate are cast Our aching burdens, loves and fears And underneath them wait Paper and tar and pitch and pine Called strife and blood and hate. Out of it all there comes a flame, A splendid widening light. Sorrow is turned to mystery And Death into delight. WHAT THE MOON SAW Two statesmen met by moonlight. Their ease was partly feigned. They glanced about the prairie. Their faces were constrained. In various ways aforetime They had misled the state, Yet did it so politely Their henchmen thought them great. They sat beneath a hedge and spake No word, but had a smoke. A satchel passed from hand to hand. Next day, the deadlock broke. THE OLD HORSE IN THE CITY The moon's a peck of corn. It lies Heaped up for me to eat. I wish that I might climb the path And taste that supper sweet. Men feed me straw and scanty grain And beat me till I'm sore. Some day I'll break the halter-rope And smash the stable-door, Run down the street and mount the hill Just as the corn appears. I've seen it rise at certain times For years and years and years. THE ROSE OF MIDNIGHT (Set to music by Albert V. Davies) The moon is now an opening flower, The sky a cliff of blue. The moon is now a silver rose; Her pollen is the dew. Her pollen is the mist that swings Across her face of dreams: Her pollen is the April rain, Filling the April streams. Her pollen is eternal life, Endless ambrosial foam. It feeds the swarming stars and fills Their hearts with honeycomb. The earth is but a passion-flower With blood upon his crown. And what shall fill his failing veins And lift his head, bowed down? This cup of peace, this silver rose Bending with fairy breath Shall lift that passion-flower, the earth, A million times from Death! THE PATH IN THE SKY I sailed a little shallop Upon a pretty sea In blue and hazy mountains, Scarce mountains unto me; Their summits lost in wonder, They wrapped the lake around, And when my shallop landed I trod on a vague ground, And climbed and climbed toward heaven, Though scarce before my feet I found one step unveiled there The blue-haze vast, complete, Until I came to Zion The gravel paths of God, My endless trail pierced the thick veil To flaming flowers and sod. I rested, looked behind me And saw where I had been. My little lake. It was the moon. Sky-mountains closed it in. WHAT THE HYENA SAID The moon is but a golden skull, She mounts the heavens now, And Moon-Worms, mighty Moon-Worms Are wreathed around her brow. The Moon-Worms are a doughty race: They eat her gray and golden face. Her eye-sockets dead, and molding head: These caverns are their dwelling-place. The Moon-Worms, serpents of the skies, From the great hollows of her eyes Behold all souls, and they are wise: With tiny, keen and icy eyes, Behold how each man sins and dies. When Earth in gold-corruption lies Long dead, the moon-worm butterflies On cyclone wings will reach this placeâ Yes, rear their brood on earth's dead face. WHAT THE SNOW MAN SAID The Moon's a snowball. See the drifts Of white that cross the sphere. The Moon's a snowball, melted down A dozen times a year. Yet rolled again in hot July When all my days are done And cool to greet the weary eye After the scorching sun. The moon's a piece of winter fair Renewed the year around, Behold it, deathless and unstained, Above the grimy ground! It rolls on high so brave and white Where the clear air-rivers flow, Proclaiming Christmas all the time And the glory of the snow! WHAT THE SCARECROW SAID The dim-winged spirits of the night Do fear and serve me well. They creep from out the hedges of The garden where I dwell. I wave my arms across the walk. The troops obey the sign, And bring me shimmering shadow-robes And cups of cowslip-wine. Then dig a treasure called the moon, A very precious thing, And keep it in the air for me Because I am a King. WHAT GRANDPA MOUSE SAID The moon's a holy owl-queen. She keeps them in a jar Under her arm till evening, Then sallies forth to war. She pours the owls upon us. They hoot with horrid noise And eat the naughty mousie-girls And wicked mousie-boys. So climb the moonvine every night And to the owl-queen pray: Leave good green cheese by moonlit trees For her to take away. And never squeak, my children, Nor gnaw the smoke-house door: The owl-queen then will love us And send her birds no more. THE BEGGAR SPEAKS (What Mister Moon Said to Me) Come, eat the bread of idleness, Come, sit beside the spring: Some of the flowers will keep awake, Some of the birds will sing. Come, eat the bread no man has sought For half a hundred years: Men hurry so they have no griefs, Nor even idle tears: They hurry so they have no loves: They cannot curse nor laughâ Their hearts die in their youth with neither Grave nor epitaph. My bread would make them careless, And never quite on timeâ Their eyelids would be heavy, Their fancies full of rhyme: Each soul a mystic rose-tree, Or a curious incense tree: Come, eat the bread of idleness, Said Mister Moon to me. WHAT THE FORESTER SAID The moon is but a candle-glow That flickers thro' the gloom: The starry space, a castle hall: And Earth, the children's room, Where all night long the old trees stand To watch the streams asleep: Grandmothers guarding trundle-beds: Good shepherds guarding sheep. CAUGHT IN A NET Upon her breast her hands and hair Were tangled all together. The moon of June forbade me notâ The golden night time weather In balmy sighs commanded me To kiss them like a feather. Her looming hair, her burning hands, Were tangled black and white. My face I buried there. I prayâ So far from her to-nightâ For grace, to dream I kiss her soul Amid the black and white. MY LADY IN HER WHITE SILK SHAWL My lady in her white silk shawl Is like a lily dim, Within the twilight of the room Enthroned and kind and prim. My lady! Pale gold is her hair. Until she smiles her face Is pale with far Hellenic moods, With thoughts that find no place. In our harsh village of the West Wherein she lives of late, She's distant as far-hidden stars, And coldâalmost!âas fate. But when she smiles she's here again Rosy with comrade-cheer, A Puritan Bacchante made To laugh around the year. The merry gentle moon herself, Heart-stirring too, like her, Wakening wild and innocent love In every worshipper. BEYOND THE MOON (Written to the Most Beautiful Woman in the World) My Sweetheart is the TRUTH BEYOND THE MOON, And never have I been in love with Woman, Always aspiring to be set in tune With one who is invisible, inhuman. O laughing girl, cold TRUTH has stepped between, Spoiling the fevers of your virgin face: Making your shining eyes but lead and clay, Mocking your brilliant brain and lady's grace. Truth haunted me the day I wooed and lost, The day I wooed and won, or wooed in play: Tho' you were Juliet or Rosalind, Thus shall it be, forever and a day. I doubt my vows, tho' sworn on my own blood, Tho' I draw toward you weeping, soul to soul, I have a lonely goal beyond the moon; Ay, beyond Heaven and Hell, I have a goal! WHAT SEMIRAMIS SAID The moon's a steaming chalice Of honey and venom-wine. A little of it sipped by night Makes the long hours divine. But oh, my reckless lovers, They drain the cup and wail, Die at my feet with shaking limbs And tender lips all pale. Above them in the sky it bends Empty and gray and dread. To-morrow night 'tis full again, Golden, and foaming red. WHAT THE GHOST OF THE GAMBLER SAID Where now the huts are empty, Where never a camp-fire glows, In an abandoned caÃ±on, A Gambler's Ghost arose. He muttered there, âThe moon's a sack Of dust.â His voice rose thin: âI wish I knew the miner-man. I'd play, and play to win. In every game in Cripple-creek Of old, when stakes were high, I held my own. Now I would play For that sack in the sky. The sport would not be ended there. 'Twould rather be begun. I'd bet my moon against his stars, And gamble for the sun. THE STRENGTH OF THE LONELY (What the Mendicant Said) The moon's a monk, unmated, Who walks his cell, the sky. His strength is that of heaven-vowed men Who all life's flames defy. They turn to stars or shadows, They go like snow or dewâ Leaving behind no sorrowâ Only the arching blue. WHAT THE SEXTON SAID Your dust will be upon the wind Within some certain years, Though you be sealed in lead to-day Amid the country's tears. When this idyllic churchyard Becomes the heart of town, The place to build garage or inn, They'll throw your tombstone down. Your name so dim, so long outworn, Your bones so near to earth, Your sturdy kindred dead and gone, How should men know your worth? So read upon the runic moon Man's epitaph, deep-writ. It says the world is one great grave. For names it cares no whit. It tells the folk to live in peace, And still, in peace, to die. At least so speaks the moon to me, The tombstone of the sky. THE SCISSORS-GRINDER (An Unconscious Prophecy Written in 1913) (What the Tramp Said) The old man had his box and wheel For grinding knives and shears. No doubt his bell in village streets Was joy to children's ears. And I bethought me of my youth When such men came around, And times I asked them in, quite sure The scissors should be ground. The old man turned and spoke to me, His face at last in view. And then I thought those curious eyes Were eyes that once I knew. âThe moon is but an emery-wheel To whet the sword of God,â He said. âAnd here beside my fire I stretch upon the sod Each night, and dream, and watch the stars And watch the ghost-clouds go. And see that sword of God in Heaven A-waving to and fro. I see that sword each century, friend. It means the world-war comes With all its bloody, wicked chiefs And hate-inflaming drums. Men talk of peace, but I have seen That emery-wheel turn round. The voice of Abel cries again To God from out the ground. The ditches must flow red, the plague Go stark and screaming by Each time that sword of God takes edge Within the midnight sky. And those that scorned their brothers here And sowed a wind of shame Will reap the whirlwind as of old And face relentless flame.â And thus the scissors-grinder spoke, His face at last in view. And there beside the railroad bridge I saw the wandering Jew. The Censer-Moon (What the Hermit Said) The moon is but a censer swung By angel hands unseen. The earth has breathed the incense, She is the angel queen. The censer makes her drunk with hope, She sees within the sky A wild dominion she shall cross Riding a chariot high. Such hands as swing the censer Shall grip the conquering steel And hew and slay 'mid demon stars But at the last shall heal. They'll cast the crowns of conquered stars On the proud queen's chariot-floor And cry: âThe whole sky loves you And the great deep shall adore.â SECTION VI INCENSE AND PRAISE, AND WHIM, AND GLORY THE STORM-FLOWER THE STORM-FLOWER BLOOMS BY THE OUTER MOAT OF MY CASTLE OF LOVE, WHILE THE PERILOUS RAIN SHRIEKS AND BEATS AT THE GRANITE WALLS, AT THE DOORS, AT EACH THICK WINDOW-PANE BUT IN THE KEEP, STILL, STILL, AND DEEP MY SWEET LOVE WAITS IN IVORY ROOMS: SHE WEARS NEW SILK FROM FAIRY LOOMS: OUR LIPS BURN SWEETLY, WITHOUT FEAR: OUR NEST IS STILL. I HEAR HER SIGH,â AND WHAT CARE I, IF THE STORM-FLOWER BLOOMS? HERE'S TO THE SPIRIT OF FIRE Here's to the spirit of fire, wherever the flame is unfurled, In the sun, it may be, as a torch to lead on and enlighten the world; That melted the glacial streams, in the day that no memories reach, That shimmered in amber and shell and weed on the earliest beach; The genius of love and of life, the power that will ever abound, That waits in the bones of the dead, who sleep till the judgment shall sound. Here's to the spirit of fire, when clothed in swift music it comes, The glow of the harvesting songs, the voice of the national drums; The whimsical, various fire, in the rhymes and ideas of men, Buried in books for an age, exploding and writhing again, And blown a red wind round the world, consuming the lies in its mirth, Then locked in dark volumes for long, and buried like coal in the earth. Here's to the comforting fire in the joys of the blind and the meek, In the customs of letterless lands, in the thoughts of the stupid and weak. In the weariest legends they tell, in their cruellest, coldest belief, In the proverbs of counter or till, in the arts of the priest or the thief. Here's to the spirit of fire, that never the ocean can drown, That glows in the phosphorent wave, and gleams in the sea-rose crown; That sleeps in the sunbeam and mist, that creeps as the wise men know, A wonder, an incense, a whim, a perfume, a fear and a glow, Ensnaring the stars with a spell, and holding the earth in a net: Yea, filling the nations with prayer, wherever man's pathway is set. BEING THE DEDICATION OF A MORNING To Hilda Conkling, Poet Eyes of the eagle are yours, eyes of the dove are yours, Heart of the robin is yours, heart of the woods is yours. The long hair of Mab is yours. The long hair of Eve is yours. And you are a cool clear river at play, A river of light, that sweeps through the breast:â Of healing and power, That surely cures. And I am young as Hilda today, And all heavy years are hurried away, And only the light and fire endures. I am a trout in this river of light, A cataract, Or a pool, A wave, or a thought, that curls and whirls, Because of these magical silly reasons:â You are all our birds, and all our seasons, And all our hopes, and all little girls, In one little lady, very polite, The doll and the darling and boy of the forest, The fern that is tallest, the dawn the heart fears, All the stars of the morning in my sight. Eyes of the eagle are yours. Eyes of the dove are yours, Oh Hilda, singer, America bringer, The prophets have told us ten thousand yearsâ Only the light of life endures So I here deny sorrow, And here denounce tears, Only the light of life endures. THE KNIGHT IN DISGUISE (Concerning O. Henry [Sidney Porter]) âHe could not forget that he was a Sidney.â Is this Sir Philip Sidney, this loud clown, The darling of the glad and gaping town? This is that dubious hero of the press Whose slangy tongue and insolent address Were spiced to rouse on Sunday afternoon The man with yellow journals round him strewn. We laughed and dozed, then roused and read again, And vowed O. Henry funniest of men. He always worked a triple-hinged surprise To end the scene and make one rub his eyes. He comes with vaudeville, with stare and leer. He comes with megaphone and specious cheer. His troupe, too fat or short or long or lean, Step from the pages of the magazine With slapstick or sombrero or with cane: The rube, the cowboy or the masher vain. They over-act each part. But at the height Of banter and of canter and delight The masks fall off for one queer instant there And show real faces: faces full of care And desperate longing: love that's hot or cold; And subtle thoughts, and countenances bold. The masks go back. 'Tis one more joke. Laugh on! The goodly grown-up company is gone. No doubt had he occasion to address The brilliant court of purple-clad Queen Bess, He would have wrought for them the best he knew And led more loftily his actor-crew. How coolly he misquoted. 'Twas his artâ Slave-scholar, who misquotedâfrom the heart. So when we slapped his back with friendly roar Aesop awaited him without the door,â Aesop the Greek, who made dull masters laugh With little tales of fox and dog and calf. And be it said, mid these his pranks so odd With something nigh to chivalry he trod And oft the drear and driven would defendâ The little shopgirl's knight unto the end. Yea, he had passed, ere we could understand The blade of Sidney glimmered in his hand. Yea, ere we knew, Sir Philip's sword was drawn With valiant cut and thrust, and he was gone. THE WIZARD IN THE STREET (Concerning Edgar Allan Poe) Who now will praise the Wizard in the street With loyal songs, with humors grave and sweetâ This Jingle-man, of strolling players born, Whom holy folk have hurried by in scorn, This threadbare jester, neither wise nor good, With melancholy bells upon his hood? The hurrying great ones scorn his Raven's croak, And well may mock his mystifying cloak Inscribed with runes from tongues he has not read To make the ignoramus turn his head. The artificial glitter of his eyes Has captured half-grown boys. They think him wise. Some shallow player-folk esteem him deep, Soothed by his steady wand's mesmeric sweep. The little lacquered boxes in his hands Somehow suggest old times and reverenced lands. From them doll-monsters come, we know not how: Puppets, with Cain's black rubric on the brow. Some passing jugglers, smiling, now concede That his best cabinet-work is made, indeed By bleeding his right arm, day after day, Triumphantly to seal and to inlay. They praise his little act of shedding tears; A trick, well learned, with patience, thro' the years. I love him in this blatant, well-fed place. Of all the faces, his the only face Beautiful, tho' painted for the stage, Lit up with song, then torn with cold, small rage, Shames that are living, loves and hopes long dead, Consuming pride, and hunger, real, for bread. Here by the curb, ye Prophets thunder deep: âWhat Nations sow, they must expect to reap,â Or haste to clothe the race with truth and power, With hymns and shouts increasing every hour. Useful are you. There stands the useless one Who builds the Haunted Palace in the sun. Good tailors, can you dress a doll for me With silks that whisper of the sounding sea? One moment, citizens,âthe weary tramp Unveileth Psyche with the agate lamp. Which one of you can spread a spotted cloak And raise an unaccounted incense smoke Until within the twilight of the day Stands dark Ligeia in her disarray, Witchcraft and desperate passion in her breath And battling will, that conquers even death? And now the evening goes. No man has thrown The weary dog his well-earned crust or bone. We grin and hie us home and go to sleep, Or feast like kings till midnight, drinking deep. He drank alone, for sorrow, and then slept, And few there were that watched him, few that wept. He found the gutter, lost to love and man. Too slowly came the good Samaritan. THREE POEMS ABOUT MARK TWAIN I. The Raft The whole world on a raft! A King is here, The record of his grandeur but a smear. Is it his deacon-beard, or old bald plate That makes the band upon his whims to wait? Loot and mud-honey have his soul defiled. Quack, pig, and priest, he drives camp-meetings wild Until they shower their pennies like spring rain That he may preach upon the Spanish main. What landlord, lawyer, voodoo-man has yet A better native right to make men sweat? The whole world on a raft! A Duke is here At sight of whose lank jaw the muses leer. Journeyman-printer, lamb with ferret eyes, In life's skullduggery he takes the prizeâ Yet stands at twilight wrapped in Hamlet dreams. Into his eyes the Mississippi gleams. The sandbar sings in moonlit veils of foam. A candle shines from one lone cabin home. The waves reflect it like a drunken star. A banjo and a hymn are heard afar. No solace on the lazy shore excels The Duke's blue castle with its steamer-bells. The floor is running water and the roof The stars' brocade with cloudy warp and woof. And on past sorghum fields the current swings. To Christian Jim the Mississippi sings. This prankish wave-swept barque has won its place, A ship of jesting for the human race. But do you laugh when Jim bows down forlorn His babe, his deaf Elizabeth to mourn? And do you laugh, when Jim, from Huck apart Gropes through the rain and night with breaking heart? But now that imp is here and we can smile Jim's child and guardian this long-drawn while. With knife and heavy gun, a hunter keen, He stops for squirrel-meat in islands green. The eternal gamin, sleeping half the day, Then stripped and sleek, a river-fish at play. And then well-dressed, ashore, he sees life spilt. The river-bank is one bright crazy-quilt Of patch-work dream, of wrath more red than lust, Where long-haired feudist Hotspurs bite the dust ... This Huckleberry Finn is but the race, America, still lovely in disgrace, New childhood of the world, that blunders on And wonders at the darkness and the dawn, The poor damned human race, still unimpressed With its damnation, all its gamin breast Chorteling at dukes and kings with nigger Jim, Then plotting for their fall, with jestings grim. Behold a Republic Where a river speaks to men And cries to those that love its ways, Answering again When in the heart's extravagance The rascals bend to say âO singing Mississippi Shine, sing for us today.â But who is this in sweeping Oxford gown Who steers the raft, or ambles up and down, Or throws his gown aside, and there in white Stands gleaming like a pillar of the night? The lion of high courts, with hoary mane, Fierce jester that this boyish court will gainâ Mark Twain! The bad world's idol: Old Mark Twain! He takes his turn as watchman with the rest, With secret transports to the stars addressed, With nightlong broodings upon cosmic law, With daylong laughter at this world so raw. All praise to Emerson and Whitman, yet The best they have to say, their sons forget. But who can dodge this genius of the stream, The Mississippi Valley's laughing dream? He is the artery that finds the sea In this the land of slaves, and boys still free. He is the river, and they one and all Sail on his breast, and to each other call. Come let us disgrace ourselves, Knock the stuffed gods from their shelves, And cinders at the schoolhouse fling. Come let us disgrace ourselves, And live on a raft with gray Mark Twain And Huck and Jim And the Duke and the King. II. When the Mississippi Flowed in Indiana (Inscribed to Bruce Campbell, who read âTom Sawyerâ with me in the old house) Beneath Time's roaring cannon Many walls fall down. But though the guns break every stone, Level every town:â Within our Grandma's old front hall Some wonders flourish yet:â The Pavement of Verona, Where stands young Juliet, The roof of Blue-beard's palace, And Kubla Khan's wild ground, The cave of young Aladdin, Where the jewel-flowers were found, And the garden of old Sparta Where little Helen played, The grotto of Miranda That Prospero arrayed. And the cave, by the Mississippi, Where Becky Thatcher strayed. On that Indiana stairway Gleams Cinderella's shoe. Upon that mighty mountainside Walks Snow-white in the dew. Upon that grassy hillside Trips shining Nicolette:â That stairway of remembrance Time's cannon will not getâ That chattering slope of glory Our little cousins made, That hill by the Mississippi Where Becky Thatcher strayed. Spring beauties on that cliffside, Love in the air, While the soul's deep Mississippi Sweeps on, forever fair. And he who enters in the cave, Nothing shall make afraid, The cave by the Mississippi Where Tom and Becky strayed. III. Mark Twain and Joan of Arc When Yankee soldiers reach the barricade Then Joan of Arc gives each the accolade. For she is there in armor clad, today, All the young poets of the wide world say. Which of our freemen did she greet the first, Seeing him come against the fires accurst? Mark Twain, our Chief with neither smile nor jest, Leading to war our youngest and our best. The Yankee to King Arthur's court returns. The sacred flag of Joan above him burns. For she has called his soul from out the tomb. And where she stands, there he will stand till doom. But I, I can but mourn, and mourn again At bloodshed caused by angels, saints, and men. THE LION The Lion is a kingly beast. He likes a Hindu for a feast. And if no Hindu he can get, The lion-family is upset. He cuffs his wife and bites her ears Till she is nearly moved to tears. Then some explorer finds the den And all is family peace again. AN EXPLANATION OF THE GRASSHOPPER The Grasshopper, the grasshopper, I will explain to you:â He is the Brownies' racehorse, The fairies' Kangaroo. THE DANGEROUS LITTLE BOY FAIRIES In fairyland the little boys Would rather fight than eat their meals. They like to chase a gauze-winged fly And catch and beat him till he squeals. Sometimes they come to sleeping men Armed with the deadly red-rose thorn, And those that feel its fearful wound Repent the day that they were born. THE MOUSE THAT GNAWED THE OAK-TREE DOWN The mouse that gnawed the oak-tree down Began his task in early life. He kept so busy with his teeth He had no time to take a wife. He gnawed and gnawed through sun and rain When the ambitious fit was on, Then rested in the sawdust till A month of idleness had gone. He did not move about to hunt The coteries of mousie-men. He was a snail-paced, stupid thing Until he cared to gnaw again. The mouse that gnawed the oak-tree down, When that tough foe was at his feetâ Found in the stump no angel-cake Nor buttered bread, nor cheese nor meatâ The forest-roof let in the sky. âThis light is worth the work,â said he. âI'll make this ancient swamp more light,â And started on another tree. THE SONG OF THE GARDEN-TOAD Down, down beneath the daisy beds, O hear the cries of pain! And moaning on the cinder-path They're blind amid the rain. Can murmurs of the worms arise To higher hearts than mine? I wonder if that gardener hears Who made the mold all fine And packed each gentle seedling down So carefully in line? I watched the red rose reaching up To ask him if he heard Those cries that stung the evening earth Till all the rose-roots stirred. She asked him if he felt the hate That burned beneath them there. She asked him if he heard the curse Of worms in black despair. He kissed the rose. What did it mean? What of the rose's prayer? Down, down where rain has never come They fight in burning graves, Bleeding and drinking blood Within those venom-caves. Blaspheming still the gardener's name, They live and hate and go. I wonder if the gardener heard The rose that told him so? FACTORY WINDOWS ARE ALWAYS BROKEN Factory windows are always broken. Somebody's always throwing bricks, Somebody's always heaving cinders, Playing ugly Yahoo tricks. Factory windows are always broken. Other windows are let alone. No one throws through the chapel-window The bitter, snarling, derisive stone. Factory windows are always broken. Something or other is going wrong. Something is rottenâI think, in Denmark. End of the factory-window song. IN PRAISE OF SONGS THAT DIE (After having read a great deal of good current poetry in the magazines and newspapers) Ah, they are passing, passing by, Wonderful songs, but born to die! Cries from the infinite human seas, Waves thrice-winged with harmonies. Here I stand on a pier in the foam Seeing the songs to the beach go home, Dying in sand while the tide flows back, As it flowed of old in its fated track. O hurrying tide that will not hear Your own foam-children dying near: Is there no refuge-house of song, No home, no haven where songs belong? O precious hymns that come and go! You perish, and I love you so! TO EVE, MAN'S DREAM OF WIFEHOOD AS DESCRIBED BY MILTON Darling of Miltonâwhen that marble man Saw you in shadow, coming from God's hand Serene and young, did he not chant for you Praises more quaint than he could understand? âTo justify the ways of God to manââ So, self-deceived, his printed purpose runs. His love for you is the true key to him, And Uriel and Michael were your sons. Your bosom nurtured his Urania. Your meek voice, piercing through his midnight sleep Shook him far more than silver chariot wheels Or rattling shields, or trumpets of the deep. Titan and lover, could be content With Eden's narrow setting for your spell? You wound soft arms around his brows. He smiled And grimly for your home built Heaven and Hell. That was his posy. A strange gift, indeed. We bring you what we can, not what is fit. Eve, dream of wifehood! Each man in his way Serves you with chants according to his wit. EDEN IN WINTER (Supposed to be chanted to some rude instrument at a modern fireplace) Chant we the story now Tho' in a house we sleep; Tho' by a hearth of coals Vigil to-night we keep. Chant we the story now, Of the vague love we knew When I from out the sea Rose to the feet of you. Bird from the cliffs you came, Flew thro' the snow to me, Facing the icy blast There by the icy sea. How did I reach your feet? Why should Iâat the end Hold out half-frozen hands Dumbly to you my friend? Ne'er had I woman seen, Ne'er had I seen a flame. There you piled fagots on, Heat roseâthe blast to tame. There by the cave-door dark, Comforting me you criedâ Wailed o'er my wounded knee, Wept for my rock-torn side. Up from the South I trailedâ Left regions fierce and fair! Left all the jungle-trees, Left the red tiger's lair. Dream-led, I scarce knew why, Into your North I trodâ Ne'er had I known the snow, Or the frost-blasted sod. O how the flakes came down! O how the fire burned high! Strange thing to see he was, Thro' his dry twigs would fly, Creep there awhile and sleepâ Then wake and bark for fightâ Biting if I too near Came to his eyes so bright. Then with a will you fed Wood to his hungry tongue. Then he did leap and singâ Dancing the clouds among, Turning the night to noon, Stinging my eyes with light, Making the snow retreat, Making the cave-house bright. There were dry fagots piled, Nuts and dry leaves and roots, Stores there of furs and hides, Sweet-barks and grains and fruits. There wrapped in fur we lay, Half-burned, half-frozen stillâ Ne'er will my soul forget All the night's bitter chill. We had not learned to speak, I was to you a strange Wolfling or wounded fawn, Lost from his forest-range. Thirsting for bloody meat, Out at the dawn we went. Weighed with our prey at eve, Home-came we all forspent. Comrades and hunters tried Ere we were maid and manâ Not till the spring awoke Laughter and speech began. Whining like forest dogs, Rustling like budding trees, Bubbling like thawing springs, Humming like little bees, Crooning like Maytime tides, Chattering parrot words, Crying the panther's cry, Chirping like mating birdsâ Thus, thus, we learned to speak, Who mid the snows were dumb, Nor did we learn to kiss Until the Spring had come. GENESIS I was but a half-grown boy, You were a girl-child slight. Ah, how weary you were! You had led in the bullock-fight ... We slew the bullock at length With knives and maces of stone. And so your feet were torn, Your lean arms bruised to the bone. Perhaps 'twas the slain beast's blood We drank, or a root we ate, Or our revelling evening bath In the fall by the garden gate, But you turned to a witching thing, Side-glancing, and frightened me; You purred like a panther's cub, You sighed like a shell from the sea. We knelt. I caressed your hair By the light of the leaping fire: Your fierce eyes blinked with smoke, Pine-fumes, that enhanced desire. I helped to unbraid your hair In wonder and fear profound: You were humming your hunting tune As it swept to the grassy ground. Our comrades, the shaggy bear, The tiger with velvet feet, The lion, crept to the light Whining for bullock meat. We fed them and stroked their necks .. They took their way to the fen Where they hunted or hid all night; No enemies, they, of men. Evil had entered not The cobra, since defiled. He watched, when the beasts had gone, Our kissing and singing wild. Beautiful friend he was, Sage, not a tempter grim. Many a year should pass Ere Satan should enter him. He danced while the evening dove And the nightingale kept in tune. I sang of the angel sun: You sang of the angel-moon: We sang of the angel-chief Who blew thro' the trees strange breath, Who helped in the hunt all day And granted the bullock's death. O Eve with the fire-lit breast And child-face red and white! I heaped the great logs high! That was our bridal night. THE PERFECT MARRIAGE I hate this yoke; for the world's sake here put it on: Knowing 'twill weigh as much on you till life is gone. Knowing you love your freedom dear, as I love mineâ Knowing that love unchained has been our life's great wine: Our one great wine (yet spent too soon, and serving none; Of the two cups free love at last the deadly one). We grant our meetings will be tame, not honey-sweet, No longer turning to the tryst with flying feet. We know the toil that now must come will spoil the bloom And tenderness of passion's touch, and in its room Will come tame habit, deadly calm, sorrow and gloom. Oh, how the battle scars the best who enter life! Each soldier comes out blind or lame from the black strife. Mad or diseased or damned of soul the best may comeâ It matters not how merrily now rolls the drum, The fife shrills high, the horn sings loud, till no steps lagâ And all adore that silken flame, Desire's great flag. We will build strong our tiny fort, strong as we canâ Holding one inner room beyond the sword of man. Love is too wide, it seems to-day, to hide it there. It seems to flood the fields of corn, and gild the airâ It seems to breathe from every brook, from flowers to sighâ It seems a cataract poured down from the great sky; It seems a tenderness so vast no bush but shows Its haunting and transfiguring light where wonder glows. It wraps us in a silken snare by shadowy streams, And wildering sweet and stung with joy your white soul seems A flame, a flame, conquering day, conquering night, Brought from our God, a holy thing, a mad delight. But love when all things beat it down, leaves the wide air, The heavens are gray, and men turn wolves, lean with despair. Ah, when we need love most, and weep, when all is dark, Love is a pinch of ashes gray with one live sparkâ Yet on the hope to keep alive that treasure strange Hangs all earth's struggle, strife and scorn, and desperate change. Love? ... we will scarcely love our babes full many a timeâ Knowing their souls and ours too well, and all our grimeâ And there beside our holy hearth we'll hide our eyesâ Lest we should flash what seems disdain without disguise. Yet there shall be no wavering there in that deep trialâ And no false fire or stranger hand or traitor vileâ We'll fight the gloom and fight the world with strong sword-play, Entrenched within our block-house small, ever at bayâ As fellow-warriors, underpaid, wounded and wild, True to their battered flag, their faith still undefiled! DARLING DAUGHTER OF BABYLON Too soon you wearied of our tears. And then you danced with spangled feet, Leading Belshazzar's chattering court A-tinkling through the shadowy street. With mead they came, with chants of shame. Desire's red flag before them flew. And Istar's music moved your mouth And Baal's deep shames rewoke in you. Now you could drive the royal car; Forget our Nation's breaking load: Now you could sleep on silver bedsâ (Bitter and dark was our abode). And so, for many a night you laughed, And knew not of my hopeless prayer, Till God's own spirit whipped you forth From Istar's shrine, from Istar's stair. Darling daughter of Babylonâ Rose by the black Euphrates floodâ Again your beauty grew more dear Than my slave's bread, than my heart's blood. We sang of Zion, good to know, Where righteousness and peace abide ... What of your second sacrilege Carousing at Belshazzar's side? Once, by a stream, we clasped tired handsâ Your paint and henna washed away. Your place, you said, was with the slaves Who sewed the thick cloth, night and day. You were a pale and holy maid Toil-bound with us. One night you said:â âYour God shall be my God until I slumber with the patriarch dead.â Pardon, daughter of Babylon, If, on this night remembering Our lover walks under the walls Of hanging gardens in the spring, A venom comes from broken hope, From memories of your comrade-song Until I curse your painted eyes And do your flower-mouth too much wrong. LIFE TRANSCENDENT (This being the name of praise given to a fair lady) I used to think, when the corn was blowing Of my lost lady, Life Transcendent, Of her valiant way, of her pride resplendent: For the corn swayed round, like her warrior-band When I knelt by the blades to kiss her hand. But now the green of the corn is going, And winter comes and a springtime sowing Of other grain, on the plains we knew. So I walk on air, where the clouds are blowing, And kiss her hand, where the gods are sowing Stars for corn, in the star-fields new. WITH A ROSE, TO BRUNHILDE Brunhilde, with the young Norn soul That has no peace, and grim as those That spun the thread of life, give heed: Peace is concealed in every rose. And in these petals peace I bring: A jewel clearer than the dew: A perfume subtler than the breath Of Spring with which it circles you. Peace I have found, asleep, awake, By many paths, on many a strand. Peace overspreads the sky with stars. Peace is concealed within your hand. And when at night I clasp it there I wonder how you never know The strength you shed from finger-tips: The treasure that consoles me so. Begin the art of finding peace, Beloved:âit is art, no less. Sometimes we find it hid beneath The orchards in their springtime dress: Sometimes one finds it in oak woods, Sometimes in dazzling mountain-snows; In books, sometimes. But pray begin By finding it within a rose. SUNSHINE (For a very little girl, not a year old) Catherine Frazee Wakefield The sun gives not directly The coal, the diamond crown; Not in a special basket Are these from Heaven let down. The sun gives not directly The plough, man's iron friend; Not by a path or stairway Do tools from Heaven descend. Yet sunshine fashions all things That cut or burn or fly; And corn that seems upon the earth Is made in the hot sky. The gravel of the roadbed, The metal of the gun, The engine of the airship Trace somehow from the sun. And so your soul, my lady (Mere sunshine, nothing more), Prepares me the contraptions I work with or adore. Within me cornfields rustle, Niagaras roar their way, Vast thunderstorms and rainbows Are in my thought to-day. Ten thousand anvils sound there By forges flaming white, And many books I read there, And many books I write; And freedom's bells are ringing, And bird-choirs chant and flyâ The whole world works in me to-day And all the shining sky, Because of one small lady Whose smile is my chief sun. She gives not any gift to me Yet all gifts, giving one. ... Amen. TWO EASTER STANZAS I. The Hope of the Resurrection Though I have watched so many mourners weep O'er the real dead, in dull earth laid asleepâ Those dead seemed but the shadows of my days That passed and left me in the sun's bright rays. Now though you go on smiling in the sun Our love is slain, and love and you were one. You are the first, you I have known so long, Whose death was deadly, a tremendous wrong. Therefore I seek the faith that sets it right Amid the lilies and the candle-light. I think on Heaven, for in that air so clear We two may meet, confused and parted here. Ah, when man's dearest dies, 'tis then he goes To that old balm that heals the centuries' woes. Then Christ's wild cry in all the streets is rife:â âI am the Resurrection and the Life.â II. We Meet at the Judgment and I Fear It Not Though better men may fear that trumpet's warning, I meet you, lady, on the Judgment morning, With golden hope my spirit still adorning. Our God who made you all so fair and sweet Is three times gentle, and before his feet Rejoicing I shall say:ââThe girl you gave Was my first Heaven, an angel bent to save. O God, her maker, if my ingrate breath Is worth this rescue from the Second Death, Perhaps her dear proud eyes grow gentler too That scorned my graceless years and trophies few. Gone are those years, and gone ill-deeds that turned Her sacred beauty from my songs that burned. We now as comrades through the stars may take The rich and arduous quests I did forsake. Grant me a seraph-guide to thread the throng And quickly find that woman-soul so strong. I dream that in her deeply-hidden heart Hurt love lived on, though we were far apart, A brooding secret mercy like your own That blooms to-day to vindicate your throne.â ALONE IN THE WIND, ON THE PRAIRIE I know a seraph who has golden eyes, And hair of gold, and body like the snow. Here in the wind I dream her unbound hair Is blowing round me, that desire's sweet glow Has touched her pale keen face, and willful mien And though she steps as one in manner born To tread the forests of fair Paradise, Dark memory's wood she chooses to adorn. Here with bowed head, bashful with half-desire She glides into my yesterday's deep dream, All glowing by the misty ferny cliff Beside the far forbidden thundering stream. Within my dream I shake with the old flood. I fear its going, ere the spring days go. Yet pray the glory may have deathless years, And kiss her hair, and sweet throat like the snow. THIS SECTION IS A CHRISTMAS TREE [This section is a Christmas tree] This section is a Christmas tree: Loaded with pretty toys for you. Behold the blocks, the Noah's arks, The popguns painted red and blue. No solemn pine-cone forest-fruit, But silver horns and candy sacks And many little tinsel hearts And cherubs pink, and jumping-jacks. For every child a gift, I hope. The doll upon the topmost bough Is mine. But all the rest are yours. And I will light the candles now. I. The Doll Upon the Topmost Bough This doll upon the topmost bough, This playmate-gift, in Christmas dress, Was taken down and brought to me One sleety night most comfortless. Her hair was gold, her dolly-sash Was gray brocade, most good to see. The dear toy laughed, and I forgot The ill the new year promised me. II. On Suddenly Receiving a Curl Long Refused Oh, saucy gold circle of fairyland silkâ Impudent, intimate, delicate treasure; A noose for my heart and a ring for my finger:â Here in my study you sing me a measure. Whimsy and song in my little gray study! Words out of wonderland, praising her fineness, Touched with her pulsating, delicate laughter, Saying, âThe girl is all daring and kindness!â Saying, âHer soul is all feminine gameness, Trusting her insights, ardent for living; She would be weeping with me and be laughing A thoroughbred, joyous receiving and giving!â III. On Receiving One of Gloriana's Letters Your pen needs but a ruffle To be Pavlova whirling. It surely is a scalawag A-scamping down the page. A pretty little May-wind The morning buds uncurling. And then the white sweet Russian, The dancer of the age. Your pen's the Queen of Sheba, Such serious questions bringing, That merry rascal Solomon Would show a sober face:â And then again Pavlova To set our spirits singing, The snowy-swan bacchante All glamour, glee and grace. IV. In Praise of Gloriana's Remarkable Golden Hair The gleaming head of one fine friend Is bent above my little song, So through the treasure-pits of Heaven In fancy's shoes, I march along. I wander, seek and peer and ponder In Splendor's last ensnaring lairâ 'Mid burnished harps and burnished crowns Where noble chariots gleam and flare: Amid the spirit-coins and gems, The plates and cups and helms of fireâ The gorgeous treasure-pits of Heavenâ Where angel-misers slake desire! O endless treasure-pits of gold Where silly angel-men make mirthâ I think that I am there this hour, Though walking in the ways of earth! TO A GOLDEN-HAIRED GIRL IN A LOUISIANA TOWN You are a sunrise, If a star should rise instead of the sun. You are a moonrise, If a star should come, in the place of the moon. You are the Spring, If a face should bloom, Instead of an apple-bough. You are my love If your heart is as kind As your young eyes now. KALAMAZOO Once, in the city of Kalamazoo, The gods went walking, two and two, With the friendly phÅnix, the stars of Orion, The speaking pony and singing lion. For in Kalamazoo in a cottage apart Lived the girl with the innocent heart. Thenceforth the city of Kalamazoo Was the envied, intimate chum of the sun. He rose from a cave by the principal street. The lions sang, the dawn-horns blew, And the ponies danced on silver feet. He hurled his clouds of love around; Deathless colors of his old heart Draped the houses and dyed the ground. O shrine of that wide young Yankee land, Incense city of Kalamazoo, That held, in the midnight, the priceless sun As a jeweller holds an opal in hand! From the awkward city of Oshkosh came Love, (the bully no whip shall tame), Bringing his gang of sinners bold. And I was the least of his Oshkosh men; But none were reticent, none were old. And we joined the singing phÅnix then, And shook the lilies of Kalamazoo All for one hidden butterfly. Bulls of glory, in cars of war We charged the boulevards, proud to die For her ribbon sailing there on high. Our blood set gutters all aflame, Where the sun slept without any shame, Cold rock till he must rise again. She made great poets of wolf-eyed menâ The dear queen-bee of Kalamazoo, With her crystal wings, and her honey heart. We fought for her favors a year and a day (Oh, the bones of the dead, the Oshkosh dead, That were scattered along her pathway red!) And then, in her harum-scarum way, She left with a passing traveller-manâ With a singing Irishman Went to Japan. Why do the lean hyenas glare Where the glory of Artemis had begunâ Of Atalanta, Joan of Arc, Lorna Doone, Rosy O'Grady, And Orphant Annie all in one? Who burned this city of Kalamazoo Till nothing was left but a ribbon or twoâ One scorched phÅnix that mourned in the dew, Acres of ashes, a junk-man's cart, A torn-up letter, a dancing shoe (And the bones of the valiant dead)? Who burned this city of Kalamazooâ Love-town Troy-town Kalamazoo? A harum-scarum innocent heart. THE CELESTIAL CIRCUS In Heaven, if not on earth, You and I will be dancing. I will whirl you over my head, A torch and a flag and a bird, A hawk that loves my shoulder, A dove with plumes outspread. We will whirl for God when the trumpets Speak the millennial word. We will howl in praise of God, Dervish and young cyclone. We will ride in the joy of God On circus horses white. Your feet will be white lightning, Your spangles white and regal, We will leap from the horses' backs To the cliffs of day and night. We will have our rest in the pits of sleep When the darkness leaps upon us, And buries us for Ã¦ons Till we rise like grass in the spring. We will come like dandelions, Like buttercups and crocuses, And all the winter of our sleep But make us storm and sing. We will tumble like swift foam On the wave-crests of old ghostland, And dance on the crafts of doom, And wrestle on the moon. And Saturn and his triple ring Will be our tinsel circus, Till all sad wraiths of yesterday With the stars rejoice and croon. O dancer, love undying, My soul, my swan, my eagle, The first of our million dancing years Dawns, dawns soon. HARPS IN HEAVEN I will bring you great harps in Heaven, Made of giant shells From the jasper sea. With a thousand burnt-up years behind, What then of the gulf from you to me? It will be but the width of a thread, Or the narrowest leaf of our sheltering tree. You dare not refuse my harps in Heaven. Or angels will mock you, and turn away. Or with angel wit, Will praise your eyes, And your pure Greek lips and bid you play, And sing of the love from them to you, And then of my poor flaming heart In the far-off earth, when the years were new. I will bring you such harps in Heaven That they will shake at your touch and breath, Whose threads are rainbows, Seventy times seven, Whose voice is life, and silence death. A KIND OF SCORN You do not know my pride Or the storm of scorn I ride. I am too proud to kiss you and leave you Without wonders Spreading round you like flame. I am too proud to leave you Without love Haunting your very name: Until you bear the Grail Above your head in splendor O child, dear and pale. I am too proud to leave you Though we part forevermore Till all your thoughts Go up toward Glory's door. Oh, I am but a sinner proud and poor, Utterly without merit To help you climb in wonder A stair toward Heaven's doorâ Except that I have prayed my God, And He will give the Grail, And you will mourn no longer, Beset, confused, and pale. And God will lift you far on high, The while I pray and pray Until the hour I die. The effectual fervent prayer availeth much. And my first prayer ascends this proud harsh day. MY LADY IS COMPARED TO A YOUNG TREE When I see a young tree In its white beginning, With white leaves And white buds Barely tipped with green, In the April weather, In the weeping sunshineâ Then I see my lady, My democratic queen, Standing free and equal With the youngest woodland sapling Swaying, singing in the wind, Delicate and white: Soul so near to blossom, Fragile, strong as death; A kiss from far-off Eden, A flash of Judgment's trumpetâ April's breath. IN MEMORY OF A CHILD The angels guide him now, And watch his curly head, And lead him in their games, The little boy we led. He cannot come to harm, He knows more than we know, His light is brighter far Than daytime here below. His path leads on and on, Through pleasant lawns and flowers, His brown eyes open wide At grass more green than ours. With playmates like himself, The shining boy will sing, Exploring wondrous woods, Sweet with eternal spring. THE DRUNKARDS IN THE STREET The Drunkards in the street are calling one another, Heeding not the night-wind, great of heart and gay,â Publicans and wantonsâ Calling, laughing, calling, While the Spirit bloweth Space and Time away. Why should I feel the sobbing, the secrecy, the glory, This comforter, this fitful wind divine? I the cautious Pharisee, the scribe, the whited sepulchreâ I have no right to God, he is not mine. Within their gutters, drunkards dream of Hell. I say my prayers by my white bed to-night, With the arms of God about me, with the angels singing, singing, Until the grayness of my soul grows white. SECTION VII RUNES OF THE ROAD Being rhymes that have to do with âAdventures While Preaching the Gospel of Beautyâ A Song in July A little bird has told me that today will appear The lost land of Atlantis, so drowned for many a year. With blue harbors for you, and mountain peaks for me. Atlantis, Atlantis, the lost land of Atlantis, Rising again from the sea! There storms of raining attar drench And drug the isle with calm. And dawn will bring us cloud cups heaped With lightning, spice and balm. There we will rest from all old things, From hot and long endeavor, Two sages lost in glorious thought And ocean dreams forever. Come sail, O Sinbad, we shall tame The waves between, in Allah's name. Coral palaces for you, Fog chalices for me, Mohammed's girls for you And Mab's girls for me, Soft shore winds for you, And mountain streams for me, In Atlantis, Atlantis, the lost land of Atlantis, Rising again from the sea! I WANT TO GO WANDERING I want to go wandering. Who shall declare I will regret if I dare? To the rich days of ageâ To some mid-afternoonâ A wide fenceless prairie, A lonely old tune, Ant-hills and sunflowers, And sunset too soon. Behind the brown mountain The sun will go down; I shall climb, I shall climb, To the sumptuous crown; To the rocks of the summit, And find some strange things:â Some echo of echoes When the thunder-wind sings; Old Spanish necklaces, Indian rings, Or a feeble old eagle With great, dragging wings. He may leave me and soar; But if he shall die, I shall bury him deep While the thunder-winds cry. And there, as the last of my earth-nights go: What is the thing I shall know? With a feather cast off from his wings I shall write, be it revel or psalm, Or whisper of redwood, or cypress, or palm,â The treasure of dream that he brings. The soul of the eagle will call, Whether he lives or he dies:â The cliff and the prairie call, The sagebrush and starlight sing, And the songs of my far-away Sangamon call From the plume of the bird of the Rockies, And midnight's omnipotent wingâ The last of my earth-nights will ring With cries from a far haunted river, And all of my wandering, Wandering, Wandering, Wandering. ... BY THE SPRING AT SUNSET Sometimes we remember kisses, Remember the dear heart-leap when they came: Not always, but sometimes we remember The kindness, the dumbness, the good flame Of laughter and farewell. Beside the road Afar from those who said âGood-byâ I write, Far from my city task, my lawful load. Sun in my face, wind beside my shoulder, Streaming clouds, banners of new-born night Enchant me now. The splendors growing bolder Make bold my soul for some new wise delight. I write the day's event, and quench my drouth, Pausing beside the spring with happy mind. And now I feel those kisses on my mouth, Hers most of all, one little friend most kind. ON THE ROAD TO NOWHERE On the road to nowhere What wild oats did you sow When you left your father's house With your cheeks aglow? Eyes so strained and eager To see what you might see? Were you thief or were you fool Or most nobly free? Were the tramp-days knightly, True sewing of wild seed? Did you dare to make the songs Vanquished workmen need? Did you waste much money To deck a leper's feast? Love the truth, defy the crowd Scandalize the priest? On the road to nowhere What wild oats did you sow? Stupids find the nowhere-road Dusty, grim and slow. Ere their sowing's ended They turn them on their track, Look at the caitiff craven wights Repentant, hurrying back! Grown ashamed of nowhere, Of rags endured for years, Lust for velvet in their hearts, Pierced with Mammon's spears, All but a few fanatics Give up their darling goal, Seek to be as others are, Stultify the soul. Reapings now confront them, Glut them, or destroy. Curious seeds, grain or weeds Sown with awful joy. Hurried is their harvest, They make soft peace with men. Pilgrims pass. They care not, Will not tramp again. O nowhere, golden nowhere! Sages and fools go on To your chaotic ocean, To your tremendous dawn. Far in your fair dream-haven, Is nothing or is all... They press on, singing, sowing Wild deeds without recall! THE BEGGAR'S VALENTINE Kiss me and comfort my heart Maiden honest and fine. I am the pilgrim boy Lame, but hunting the shrine; Fleeing away from the sweets, Seeking the dust and rain, Sworn to the staff and road, Scorning pleasure and pain; Nevertheless my mouth Would rest like a bird an hour And find in your curls a nest And find in your breast a bower: Nevertheless my eyes Would lose themselves in your own, Rivers that seek the sea, Angels before the throne: Kiss me and comfort my heart, For love can never be mine; Passion, hunger and pain, These are the only wine Of the pilgrim bound to the road. He would rob no man of his own. Your heart is another's, I know, Your honor is his alone. The feasts of a long-drawn love, The feasts of a wedded life, The harvests of patient years, And hearthstone and children and wife: These are your lords, I know. These can never be mineâ This is the price I pay For the foolish search for the shrine: This is the price I pay For the joy of my midnight prayers, Kneeling beneath the moon With hills for my altar stairs; This is the price I pay For the throb of the mystic wings. When the dove of God comes down And beats round my heart and sings; This is the price I pay For the light I shall some day see At the ends of the infinite earth When truth shall come to me. And what if my body die Before I meet the truth? The road is dear, more dear Than love or life or youth. The road, it is the road, Mystical, endless, kind, Mother of visions vast, Mother of soul and mind; Mother of all of me But the blood that cries for a mateâ That cries for a farewell kiss From the child of God at the gate. THE WOULD-BE MERMAN Mobs are like the Gulf Stream, Like the vast Atlantic. In your fragile boats you ride, Conceited folk at ease. Far beneath are dancers, Mermen wild and frantic, Circling round the giant glowing Sea-anemones. âCrude, ill-smelling voters,â Herds,â to you in seeming. But to me their draggled clothes Are scales of gold and red. Ah, the pink sea-horses, Green sea-dragons gleaming, And knights that chase the dragons And spear them till they're dead! Wisdom waits the diver In the social oceanâ Rainbow shells of wonder, Piled into a throne. I would go exploring Through the wide commotion, Building under some deep cliff A pearl-throne all my own. Yesterday I dived there, Grinned at all the roaring, Clinging to the corals for a flash, Defying death. Mermen came rejoicing, In procession pouring, Yet I lost my feeble grip And came above for breath. I would be a merman. Not in desperation A momentary diver Blue for lack of air. But with gills deep-breathing Swim amid the nationâ Finny feet and hands forsooth, Sea-laurels in my hair. HONOR AMONG SCAMPS We are the smirched. Queen Honor is the spotless. We slept thro' wars where Honor could not sleep. We were faint-hearted. Honor was full-valiant. We kept a silence Honor could not keep. Yet this late day we make a song to praise her. We, codeless, will yet vindicate her code. She who was mighty, walks with us, the beggars. The merchants drive her out upon the road. She makes a throne of sod beside our campfire. We give the maiden-queen our rags and tears. A battered, rascal guard have rallied round her, To keep her safe until the better years. WHY I VOTED THE SOCIALIST TICKET I am unjust, but I can strive for justice. My life's unkind, but I can vote for kindness. I, the unloving, say life should be lovely. I, that am blind, cry out against my blindness. Man is a curious bruteâhe pets his fanciesâ Fighting mankind, to win sweet luxury. So he will be, tho' law be clear as crystal, Tho' all men plan to live in harmony. Come let us vote against our human nature, Crying to God in all the polling places To heal our everlasting sinfulness And make us sages with transfigured faces. GALAHAD, KNIGHT WHO PERISHED (A Poem dedicated to all Crusaders against the International and Interstate Traffic in Young Girls) Galahad ... soldier that perished ... ages ago, Our hearts are breaking with shame, our tears overflow. Galahad ... knight who perished ... awaken again, Teach us to fight for immaculate ways among men. Soldiers fantastic, we pray to the star of the sea, We pray to the mother of God that the bound may be free. Rose-crowned lady from heaven, give us thy grace, Help us the intricate, desperate battle to face, Till the leer of the trader is seen nevermore in the land, Till we bring every maid of the age to one sheltering hand. Ah, they are priceless, the pale and the ivory and red! Breathless we gaze on the curls of each glorious head! Arm them with strength mediÃ¦val, thy marvellous dower, Blast now their tempters, shelter their steps with thy power. Leave not life's fairest to perishâstranger to thee, Let not the weakest be shipwrecked, oh, star of the sea! THE TRAP She was taught desire in the street, Not at the angels' feet. By the good no word was said Of the worth of the bridal bed. The secret was learned from the vile, Not from her mother's smile. Home spoke not. And the girl Was caught in the public whirl. Do you say, âShe gave consent: Life drunk, she was content With beasts that her fire could pleaseâ? But she did not choose disease Of mind and nerves and breath. She was trapped to a slow, foul death. The door was watched so well, That the steep dark stair to hell Was the only escaping way ... âShe gave consent,â you say? Some think she was meek and good, Only lost in the wood Of youth, and deceived in man When the hunger of sex began That ties the husband and wife To the end in a strong fond life. Her captor, by chance, was one Of those whose passion was done, A cold fierce worm of the sea Enslaving for you and me. The wages the poor must take Have forced them to serve this snake. Yea, half-paid girls must go For bread to his pit below. What hangman shall wait his host Of butchers from coast to coast, New York to the Golden Gateâ The merger of death and fate, Lust-kings with a careful plan Clean-cut, American? In liberty's name we cry For these women about to die. O mothers who failed to tell The mazes of heaven and hell, Who failed to advise, implore Your daughters at Love's strange door, What will you do this day? Your dear ones are hidden away, As good as chained to the bed, Hid like the mad, or the dead:â The glories of endless years Drowned in their harlot-tears: The children they hoped to bear, Grandchildren strong and fair, The life for ages to be, Cut off like a blasted tree, Murdered in filth in a day, Somehow by the merchant gay! In liberty's name we cry For these women about to die. What shall be said of a state Where traps for the white brides wait? Of sellers of drink who play The game for the extra pay? Of statesmen in league with all Who hope for the girl-child's fall? Of banks where hell's money is paid And Pharisees all afraid Of panders that help them sin? When will our wrath begin? THE GAMBLERS Life's a jail where men have common lot. Gaunt the one who has, and who has not. All our treasures neither less nor more, Bread alone comes thro' the guarded door. Cards are foolish in this jail, I think, Yet they play for shoes, for drabs and drink. She, my lawless, sharp-tongued gypsy maid Will not scorn with me this jail-bird trade, Pets some fox-eyed boy who turns the trick, Tho' he win a button or a stick, Pencil, garter, ribbon, corset-laceâ His the glory, mine is the disgrace. Sweet, I'd rather lose than win despite Love of hearty words and maids polite. âLove's a gamble,â say you. I deny. Love's a gift. I love you till I die. Gamblers fight like rats. I will not play. All I ever had I gave away. All I ever coveted was peace Such as comes if we have jail release. Cards are puzzles, tho' the prize be gold, Cards help not the bread that tastes of mold, Cards dye not your hair to black more deep. Cards make not the children cease to weep. Scorned, I sit with half-shut eyes all dayâ Watch the cataract of sunshine play Down the wall, and dance upon the floor. Sun, come down and break the dungeon door! Of such gold dust could I make a key,â Turn the boltâhow soon we would be free! Over borders we would hurry on Safe by sunrise farms, and springs of dawn, Wash our wounds and jail stains there at last, Azure rivers flowing, flowing past. God has great estates just past the line, Green farms for all, and meat and corn and wine. IN THE IMMACULATE CONCEPTION CHURCH Hunted by friends who think that life is play, Shaken by holy loves, more feared than foes, By beauty's amber cup, that overflows, And pride of place that leads me more astray:â Here I renew my vows, and this chief vowâ To seek each year this shrine of deathless power, Keeping my springtime cornland thoughts in flower, While labor-gnarled gray Christians round me bow. Arm me against great towns, strong spirits old! St. Francis keep me road-worn, music-fed. Help me to look upon the poorhouse bed As a most fitting death, more dear than gold. Help me to seek the sunburned groups afield The iron folk, the pioneers free-born. Make me to voice the tall men in the corn. Let boyhood's wildflower days a bright fruit yield. Scourge me, a slave that brings unhallowed praise To you, stern Virgin in this church so sweet, If I desert the ways wherein my feet Were set by Heaven, in prenatal days. STAR OF MY HEART Star of my heart, I follow from afar. Sweet Love on high, lead on where shepherds are, Where Time is not, and only dreamers are. Star from of old, the Magi-Kings are dead And a foolish Saxon seeks the manger-bed. Oh, lead me to Jehovah's child Across this dreamland lone and wild, Then will I speak this prayer unsaid, And kiss his little haloed headâ âMy star and I, we love thee, little child.â Except the Christ be born again to-night In dreams of all men, saints and sons of shame, The world will never see his kingdom bright. Stars of all hearts, lead onward thro' the night Past death-black deserts, doubts without a name, Past hills of pain and mountains of new sin To that far sky where mystic births begin Where dreaming ears the angel-song shall win. Our Christmas shall be rare at dawning there, And each shall find his brother fair, Like a little child within: All hearts of the earth shall find new birth And wake, no more to sin. LOOK YOU, I'LL GO PRAY Look you, I'll go pray My shame is crying, My soul is gray and faint, My faith is dying. Look you, I'll go prayâ âSweet Mary, make me clean, Thou rainstorm of the soul, Thou wine from worlds unseen.â A PRAYER TO ALL THE DEAD AMONG MINE OWN PEOPLE Are these your presences, my clan from Heaven? Are these your hands upon my wounded soul? Mine own, mine own, blood of my blood be with me, Fly by my path till you have made me whole! AT MASS No doubt to-morrow I will hide My face from you, my King. Let me rejoice this Sunday noon, And kneel while gray priests sing. It is not wisdom to forget. But since it is my fate Fill thou my soul with hidden wine To make this white hour great. My God, my God, this marvellous hour I am your son I, know. Once in a thousand days your voice Has laid temptation low. THE DANDELION O dandelion, rich and haughty, King of village flowers! Each day is coronation time, You have no humble hours. I like to see you bring a troop To beat the blue-grass spears, To scorn the lawn-mower that would be Like fate's triumphant shears, Your yellow heads are cut away, It seems your reign is o'er. By noon you raise a sea of stars More golden than before. THE CITY THAT WILL NOT REPENT Climbing the heights of Berkeley Nightly I watch the West. There lies new San Francisco, Sea-maid in purple dressed, Wearing a dancer's girdle All to inflame desire: Scorning her days of sackcloth, Scorning her cleansing fire. See, like a burning city Sets now the red sun's dome. See, mystic firebrands sparkle There on each store and home. See how the golden gateway Burns with the day to beâ Torch-bearing fiends of portent Loom o'er the earth and sea. Not by the earthquake daunted Nor by new fears made tame, Painting her face and laughing Plays she a new-found game. Here on her half-cool cinders 'Frisco abides in mirth, Planning the wildest splendor Ever upon the earth. Here on this crumbling rock-ledge 'Frisco her all will stake, Blowing her bubble-towers, Swearing they will not break, Rearing her Fair transcendent, Singing with piercing art, Calling to Ancient Asia, Wooing young Europe's heart. Here where her God has scourged her Wantoning, singing sweet: Waiting her mad bad lovers Here by the judgment-seat! 'Frisco, God's doughty foeman, Scorns and blasphemes him strong. Tho' He again should smite her She would not slack her song. Nay, she would shriek and rallyâ 'Frisco would ten times rise! Not till her last tower crumbles, Not till her last rose dies, Not till the coast sinks seaward, Not till the cold tides beat Over the high white Shasta, 'Frisco will cry defeat. God loves this rebel city, Loves foemen brisk and game, Tho', just to please the angels, He may send down his flame. God loves the golden leopard Tho' He may spoil her lair. God smites, yet loves the lion. God makes the panther fair. Dance then, wild guests o! 'Frisco, Yellow, bronze, white and red! Dance by the golden gatewayâ Dance, tho' He smite you dead! THE VOICE OF ST. FRANCIS OF ASSISI I saw St. Francis by a stream Washing his wounds that bled. The aspens quivered overhead. The silver doves flew round. Weeping and sore dismayed âPeace, peace,â St. Francis prayed. But the soft doves quickly fled. Carrion crows flew round. An earthquake rocked the ground. âWar, war,â the west wind said. THE GOLDEN WHALES OF CALIFORNIA (Inscribed to Isadora Bennett Reed) I. A Short Walk along the Coast Yes, I have walked in California, And the rivers there are blue and white. Thunderclouds of grapes hang on the mountains. Bears in the meadows pitch and fight. (Limber, double-jointed lords of fate, Proud native sons of the Golden Gate.) And flowers burst like bombs in California, Exploding on tomb and tower. And the panther-cats chase the red rabbits, Scatter their young blood every hour. Both the cattle and the swine of California, On the hills or in the holes:â Have ears of silk and velvet, Have tusks like long white poles. And the cattle and the swine, big hearted, Walk with pride to their doom For they feed on the sacred raisins Where the great black agates loom. Goshawfuls are Burbanked with the grizzly bears. At midnight their children come clanking up the stairs. They wiggle up the canyons, Nose into the caves, And swallow the papooses and the Indian braves. The trees climb so high the crows are dizzy Flying to their nests at the top. While the jazz-birds screech, and storm the brazen beach And the sea-stars turn flip flop. The solid Golden Gate soars up to Heaven. Perfumed cataracts are hurled From the zones of silver snow To the ripening rye below, To the land of the lemon and the nut And the biggest ocean in the world. While the Native Sons, like lords tremendous, Lift up their heads with chants sublime, And the band-stands sound the trombone, the saxophone and xylophone And the whales roar in perfect tune and time. And the chanting of the whales of California I have set my heart upon. It is sometimes a play by Belasco, Sometimes a tale of Prester John. II. The Chanting of the Whales North to the Pole, south to the Pole The whales of California wallow and roll. They dive and breed and snort and play And the sun-struck feed them every day Boatloads of citrons, quinces, cherries, Of bloody strawberries, plums and beets, Hogsheads of pomegranates, vats of sweets, And the he-whales' chant like a cyclone blares, Proclaiming the California noons So gloriously hot some days The snake is fried in the desert And the flea no longer plays. There are ten gold suns in California When all other lands have one, For the Golden Gate must have due light And persimmons be well-done. And the hot whales slosh and cool in the wash And the fume of the hollow sea. Rally and roam in the loblolly foam And whoop that their souls are free. (Limber, double-jointed lords of fate, Proud native sons of the Golden Gate.) And they chant of the forty-niners Who sailed round the cape for their loot With guns and picks and washpans And a dagger in each boot. How the richest became the King of England, The poorest became the King of Spain, The bravest a colonel in the army, And a mean one went insane. The ten gold suns are so blasting The sunstruck scoot for the sea And turn to mermen and mermaids And whoop that their souls are free. (Limber, double-jointed lords of fate, Proud native sons of the Golden Gate.) And they take young whales for their bronchos And old whales for their steeds, Harnessed with golden seaweeds, And driven with golden reeds. They dance on the shore throwing rose-leaves. They kiss all night throwing hearts. They fight like scalded wildcats When the least bit of fighting starts. They drink, these belly-busting devils And their tremens shake the ground. And then they repent like whirlwinds And never were such saints found. They will give you their plug tobacco. They will give you the shirts off their backs, They will cry for your every sorrow, Put ham in your haversacks. And they feed the cuttlefishes, whales and skates With dates and figs in bales and crates:â Shiploads of sweet potatoes, peanuts, rutabagas, Honey in hearts of gourds; Grapefruits and oranges barrelled with apples, And spices like sharp sweet swords. III. St. Francis of San Francisco But the surf is white, down the long strange coast With breasts that shake with sighs, And the ocean of all oceans Holds salt from weary eyes. St. Francis comes to his city at night And stands in the brilliant electric light And his swans that prophesy night and day Would soothe his heart that wastes away: The giant swans of California That nest on the Golden Gate And beat through the clouds serenely And on St. Francis wait. But St. Francis shades his face in his cowl And stands in the street like a lost gray owl. He thinks of gold ... gold. He sees on far redwoods Dewfall and dawning: Deep in Yosemite Shadows and shrines: He hears from far valleys Prayers by young Christians, He sees their due penance So cruel, so cold; He sees them made holy, White-souled like young aspens With whimsies and fancies untold:â The opposite of gold. And the mighty mountain swans of California Whose eggs are like mosque domes of Ind, Cry with curious notes That their eggs are good for boats To toss upon the foam and the wind. He beholds on far rivers The venturesome lovers Sailing for the sea All night In swanshells white. He sees them far on the ocean prevailing In a year and a month and a day of sailing Leaving the whales and their whoop unfailing On through the lightning, ice and confusion North of the North Pole, South of the South Pole, And west of the west of the west of the west, To the shore of Heartache's Cure, The opposite of gold, On and on like Columbus With faith and eggshell sure. IV. The Voice of the Earthquake But what is the earthquake's cry at last Making St. Francis yet aghast:â âOh the flashing cornucopia of haughty California From here on, the audience joins in the refrain:ââgold, gold, gold.â Is gold, gold, gold. Their brittle speech and their clutching reach Is gold, gold, gold. What is the fire-engine's ding dong bell? The burden of the burble of the bullfrog in the well? Gold, gold, gold. What is the color of the cup and plate And knife and fork of the chief of state? Gold, gold, gold. What is the flavor of the Bartlett pear? What is the savor of the salt sea air? Gold, gold, gold. What is the color of the sea-girl's hair? Gold, gold, gold. In the church of Jesus and the streets of Venus:â Gold, gold, gold. What color are the cradle and the bridal bed? What color are the coffins of the great gray dead? Gold, gold, gold. What is the hue of the big whales' hide? Gold, gold, gold. What is the color of their guts' inside? Gold, gold, gold. âWhat is the color of the pumpkins in the moonlight? Gold, gold, gold. The color of the moth and the worm in the starlight? Gold, gold, gold.â I WENT DOWN INTO THE DESERT I went down into the desert To meet Elijahâ Arisen from the dead. I thought to find him in an echoing cave; For so my dream had said. I went down into the desert To meet John the Baptist. I walked with feet that bled, Seeking that prophet lean and brown and bold. I spied foul fiends instead. I went down into the desert To meet my God. By him be comforted. I went down into the desert To meet my God. And I met the devil in red. I went down into the desert To meet my God. O Lord my God, awaken from the dead! I see you there, your thorn-crown on the ground, I see you there, half-buried in the sand. I see you there, your white bones glistening bare The carrion-birds a-wheeling round your head. POEMS SPEAKING OF BUDDHA, PRINCE SIDDARTHA I. With a Bouquet of Twelve Roses I saw Lord Buddha towering by my gate Saying: âOnce more, good youth, I stand and wait.â Saying: âI bring you my fair Law of Peace And from your withering passion full release; Release from that white hand that stabbed you so. The road is calling. With the wind you go, Forgetting her imperious disdainâ Quenching all memory in the sun and rain.â âExcellent Lord, I come. But first,â I said, âGrant that I bring her these twelve roses red. Yea, twelve flower kisses for her rose-leaf mouth, And then indeed I go in bitter drouth To that far valley where your river flows In Peace, that once I found in every rose.â II. The Firemen's Ball Section One âGive the engines room, Give the engines room.â Louder, faster The little band-master Whips up the fluting, Hurries up the tooting. He thinks that he stands, The reins in his hands, To be read, or chanted, with the heavy buzzing bass of fire-engines pumping. In this passage the reading or chanting is shriller and higher. In the fire-chief's place In the night alarm chase. The cymbals whang, The kettledrums bang:â âClear the street, Clear the street, Clear the streetâBoom, boom. In the evening gloom, In the evening gloom, Give the engines room, Give the engines room, Lest souls be trapped In a terrible tomb.â The sparks and the pine-brands Whirl on high From the black and reeking alleys To the wide red sky. Hear the hot glass crashing, Hear the stone steps hissing. Coal-black streams Down the gutters pour. There are cries for help From a far fifth floor. For a longer ladder Hear the fire-chief call. Listen to the music Of the firemen's ball. Listen to the music Of the firemen's ball. â'Tis the To be read or chanted in a heavy bass. Night Of doom.â Say the ding-dong doom-bells. âNight Of doom.â Say the ding-dong doom-bells. Faster, faster The red flames come. âHum grum,â say the engines, âHum grum grum.â âBuzz, buzz,â Shriller and higher. Says the crowd. âSee, see,â Calls the crowd. âLook out,â Yelps the crowd And the high walls fall:â Listen to the music Of the firemen's ball. Listen to the music Of the firemen's ball. â'Tis the Heavy bass. Night Of doom,â Say the ding-dong doom-bells. Night Of doom, Say the ding-dong doom-bells. Whangaranga, whangaranga, Whang, whang, whang, Clang, clang, clangaranga, Bass, much slower. Clang, clang, clang. Clangâaârangaâ Clangâaârangaâ Clangâaârangaâ Clang, Clang, Clang. Listenâtoâtheâmusicâ Of the firemen's ballâ Section Two âMany's the heart that's breaking If we could read them all After the ball is over.â (An old song.) Scornfully, gaily To be read or sung slowly and softly, in the manner of lustful, insinuating music. The bandmaster sways, Changing the strain That the wild band plays. With a red and royal intoxication, A tangle of sounds And a syncopation, Sweeping and bending From side to side, Master of dreams, With a peacock pride. A lord of the delicate flowers of delight He drives compunction Back through the night. Dreams he's a soldier Plumed and spurred, And valiant lads Arise at his word, Flaying the sober Thoughts he hates, Driving them back From the dream-town gates. How can the languorous Dancers know The red dreams come When the good dreams go? To be read or chanted slowly and softly in the manner of lustful, insinuating music â'Tis the Night Of love,â Call the silver joy-bells, âNight Of love,â Call the silver joy-bells. Honey and wine, Honey and wine. Sing low, now, violins, Sing, sing low, Blow gently, wood-wind, Mellow and slow. Like midnight poppies The sweethearts bloom. Their eyes flash power, Their lips are dumb. Faster and faster Their pulses come, Though softer now The drum-beats fall. Honey and wine, Honey and wine. 'Tis the firemen's ball, 'Tis the firemen's ball. âI am slain,â With a climax of whispered mourning. Cries true-love There in the shadow. âAnd I die,â Cries true-love, There laid low. âWhen the fire-dreams come, The wise dreams go.â But HIS CRY IS DROWNED Suddenly interrupting. To be read or sung in heavy bass. First eight lines as harsh as possible. Then gradually musical and sonorous. By THE PROUD BAND-MASTER. And now great gongs whang, Sharper, faster, And kettledrums rattle And hide the shame With a swish and a swirk In dead love's name. Red and crimson And scarlet and rose Magical poppies The sweethearts bloom. The scarlet stays When the rose-flush goes, And love lies low In a marble tomb. â'Tis the Night Of doom,â Call the ding-dong doom-bells. âNight Of Doom,â Call the ding-dong doom-bells. Hark how the piccolos still make cheer. Sharply interrupting in a very high key. â'Tis a moonlight night in the spring of the year.â Clangaranga, CLANGARANGA, Heavy bass. Clang ... CLANG ...

Of ... THE ... FIREMEN'S ... BALL ... Section Three In Which, contrary to Artistic Custom, the moral of the piece is placed before the reader. (From the first Khandaka of the Mahavagga: âThere Buddha thus addressed his disciples: âEverything, O mendicants, is burning. With what fire is it burning? I declare unto you it is burning with the fire of passion, with the fire of anger, with the fire of ignorance. It is burning with the anxieties of birth, decay and death, grief, lamentation, suffering and despair. ... A disciple, ... becoming weary of all that, divests himself of passion. By absence of passion he is made free.ââ) I once knew a teacher, To be intoned after the manner of a priestly service. Who turned from desire, Who said to the young men âWine is a fire.â Who said to the merchants:â âGold is a flame That sears and tortures If you play at the game.â I once knew a teacher Who turned from desire Who said to the soldiers, âHate is a fire.â Who said to the statesmen:â âPower is a flame That flays and blisters If you play at the game.â I once knew a teacher Who turned from desire, Who said to the lordly, âPride is a fire.â Who thus warned the revellers:â âLife is a flame. Be cold as the dew Would you win at the game With hearts like the stars, With hearts like the stars.â Interrupting very loudly for the last time. So BEWARE, So BEWARE, So BEWARE OF THE FIRE. Clear the streets, Boom, BOOM, Clear the streets, Boom, BOOM, Give THE ENGINES ROOM, Give THE ENGINES ROOM, Lest SOULS BE TRAPPED In A TERRIBLE TOMB. Says THE SWIFT WHITE HORSE To THE SWIFT BLACK HORSE:â âThere GOES THE ALARM, There GOES THE ALARM. They ARE HITCHED, THEY ARE OFF, They ARE GONE IN A FLASH, And THEY STRAIN AT THE DRIVER'S IRON ARM.â Clang ... A ... RANGA. ... Clang ... A ... RANGA. ... Clang ... CLANG ... CLANG. ... Clang ...

To Buddha Awake again in Asia, Lord of Peace, Awake and preach, for her far swordsmen rise. And would they sheathe the sword before you, friend, Or scorn your way, while looking in your eyes? Good comrade and philosopher and prince, Thoughtful and thoroughbred and strong and kind, Dare they to move against your pride benign, Lord of the Law, high chieftain of the mind? But what can Europe say, when in your name The throats are cut, the lotus-ponds turn red? And what can Europe say, when with a laugh Old Asia heaps her hecatombs of dead? THE COMET OF PROPHECY I had hold of the comet's mane A-clinging like grim death. I passed the dearest star of all, The one with violet breath: The blue-gold-silver Venus star, And almost lost my hold. ... Again I ride the chaos-tide, Again the winds are cold. I look ahead, I look above, I look on either hand. I cannot sight the fields I seek, The holy No-Man's-Land. And yet my heart is full of faith. My comet splits the gloom, His red mane slaps across my face, His eyes like bonfires loom. My comet smells the far-off grass Of valleys richly green. My comet sights strange continents My sad eyes have not seen, We gallop through the whirling mist. My good steed cannot fail. And we shall reach that flowery shore, And wisdom's mountain scale. And I shall find my wizard cloak Beneath that alien sky And touching black soil to my lips Begin to prophesy. While chaos sleet and chaos rain Beat on an Indian Drum There in to-morrow's moon I will stand, And speak the age to come. THE TRAMP'S REFUSAL On Being Asked by a Beautiful Gypsy to Join Her Group of Strolling Players Lady, I cannot act, though I admire God's great chameleons Booth-Barret men. But when the trees are green, my thoughts may be October-red. December comes again And snowy Christmas there within my breast Though I be walking in the August dust. Often my lone contrary sword is bright When every other soldier's sword is rust. Sometimes, while churchly friends go up to God On wings of prayer to altars of delight I walk and talk with Satan, call him friend, And greet the imps with converse most polite. When hunger nips me, then at once I knock At the near farmer's door and ask for bread. I must, when I have wrought a curious song Pin down some stranger till the thing is read. When weeds choke up within, then look to me To show the world the manners of a weed. I cannot change my cloak except my heart Has changed and set the fashion for the deed. When love betrays me I go forth to tell The first kind gossip that too-patent fact. I cannot pose at hunger, love or shame. It plagues me not to say: âI cannot act.â I only mourn that this unharnessed me Walks with the devil far too much each day. I would be chained to angel-kings of fire. And whipped and driven up the heavenly way. THE FLOWER OF MENDING (To Eudora, after I had had certain dire adventures) When Dragon-fly would fix his wings, When Snail would patch his house, When moths have marred the overcoat Of tender Mister Mouse, The pretty creatures go with haste To the sunlit blue-grass hills Where the Flower of Mending yields the wax And webs to help their ills. The hour the coats are waxed and webbed They fall into a dream, And when they wake the ragged robes Are joined without a seam. My heart is but a dragon-fly, My heart is but a mouse, My heart is but a haughty snail In a little stony house. Your hand was honey-comb to heal, Your voice a web to bind. You were a Mending Flower to me To cure my heart and mind. SECTION VIII HOME TOWN Being verses that carry further the metaphors of âThe Golden Book of Springfieldâ AFTER READING THE SAD STORY OF THE FALL OF BABYLON O Lady, my city, and new flower of the prairie What have we to do with this long time ago? O lady love, Bud of tomorrow, With eyes that hold the hundred years Yet to ebb and flow, And breasts that burn With great-great-grandsons All their valor, all their tears, A century hence shall know, What have we to do With this long time ago? TO REFORMERS IN DESPAIR 'Tis not too late to build our young land right, Cleaner than Holland, courtlier than Japan, Devout like early Rome with hearths like hers, Hearths that will recreate the breed called man. THE CORNFIELDS The cornfields rise above mankind, Lifting white torches to the blue, Each season not ashamed to be Magnificently decked for you. What right have you to call them yours, And in brute lust of riches burn Without some radiant penance wrought, Some beautiful, devout return? KING ARTHURS'S MEN HAVE COME AGAIN (Written while a field-worker in the Anti-Saloon League of Illinois) King Arthur's men have come again. They challenge everywhere The foes of Christ's Eternal Church. Her incense crowns the air. The heathen knighthood cower and curse To hear the bugles ring, But spears are set, the charge is on, Wise Arthur shall be king! And Cromwell's men have come again, I meet them in the street. Stern but in thisâno way of thorns Shall snare the children's feet. The revelling foemen wreak but waste, A sodden poisonous band. Fierce Cromwell builds the flower-bright towns, And a more sunlit land! And Lincoln's men have come again. Up from the South he flayed, The grandsons of his foes arise In his own cause arrayed. They rise for freedom and clean laws High laws, that shall endure. Our God establishes his arm And makes the battle sure! DRINK FOR SALE. âWHAT BLOSSOMS ARE YOU STEWING, WHAT ROOTS AND CREEPING THINGS?â HE ANSWERED: âIN MY CALDRON ARE THREADS FROM COMETS WINGS, THE VIOLETS OF THE ANGELS, AND DEW FROM EDENS HILL, AND GRAPES OF OLD ENGEDI; GOOD BROTHER DRINK YOUR FILL. ONE CUP WILL WARM YOUR HEART WITH LOVE: THE PRICE, A PIECE OF GOLDâ I WAITED TILL THE FLAME WAS DEAD, THE LIQUOR CLEAR AND COLD: IN THE BOTTOM OF THE CALDRON WERE THE HEADS OF DOGS AND MEN, AND WINGS OF LARKS AND ROBINS WHO WILL NEVER SING AGAIN. ABOVE THE CUP HE FILLED, I SAW THE SOULS OF RATS IN FLIGHT, SO I DID NOT BUY HIS LIQUOR, AND I BADE THE DWARF GOODNIGHT. NICHOLAS VACHEL LINDSAY, RHYMER AND DESIGNER [SAID THIRST TO HUNGER ONE DAY] SAID THIRST TO HUNGER ONE DAY, WHY DO WE ALWAYS MEET? I WISH YOU WOULD GO AND PLAY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET. ON READING OMAR KHAYYAM (During an anti-saloon campaign, in central Illinois) In the midst of the battle I turned (For the thunders could flourish without me) And hid by a rose-hung wall, Forgetting the murder about me; And wrote, from my wound on the stone, In mirth, half prayer, half play:â âSend me a picture book, Send me a song, today.â I saw him there by the wall When I scarce had written the line, In the enemy's colors dressed And the serpent-standard of wine Writhing its withered length From his ghostly hands o'er the ground, And there by his shadowy breast The glorious poem I found. This was his world-old cry: Thus read the famous prayer: âWine, wine, wine and flowers And cup-bearers always fair!â 'Twas a book of the snares of earth Bordered in gold and blue, And I read each line to the wind And read to the roses too: And they nodded their womanly heads And told to the wall just why For wine of the earth men bleed, Kingdoms and empires die. I envied the grape-stained sage (The roses were praising him): The ways of the world seemed good And the glory of heaven dim. I envied the endless kings Who found great pearls in the mire, Who bought with the nation's life The cup of delicious fire. But the wine of God came down, And I drank it out of the air. (Fair is the serpent-cup, But the cup of God more fair.) The wine of God came down That makes no drinker to weep. And I went back to battle again Leaving the singer asleep. FOREIGN MISSIONS IN BATTLE ARRAY An endless line of splendor, These troops with heaven for home, With creeds they go from Scotland, With incense go from Rome. These, in the name of Jesus, Against the dark gods stand, They gird the earth with valor, They heed their King's command. Onward the line advances, Shaking the hills with power, Slaying the hidden demons, The lions that devour. No bloodshed in the wrestling,â But souls new-born ariseâ The nations growing kinder, The child-hearts growing wise. What is the final ending? The issue, can we know? Will Christ outlive Mohammed? Will Kali's altar go? This is our faith tremendous,â Our wild hope, who shall scorn,â That in the name of Jesus The world shall be reborn! A RHYME ABOUT AN ELECTRICAL ADVERTISING SIGN I look on the specious electrical light Blatant, mechanical, crawling and white, Wickedly red or malignantly green Like the beads of a young Senegambian queen. Showing, while millions of souls hurry on, The virtues of collars, from sunset till dawn, By dart or by tumble of whirl within whirl, Starting new fads for the shame-weary girl, By maggoty motions in sickening line Proclaiming a hat or a soup or a wine, While there far above the steep cliffs of the street The stars sing a message elusive and sweet. Now man cannot rest in his pleasure and toil His clumsy contraptions of coil upon coil Till the thing he invents, in its use and its range, Leads on to the marvellous CHANGE BEYOND CHANGE Some day this old Broadway shall climb to the skies, As a ribbon of cloud on a soul-wind shall rise. And we shall be lifted, rejoicing by night, Till we join with the planets who choir their delight. The signs in the street and the signs in the skies Shall make a new Zodiac, guiding the wise, And Broadway make one with that marvellous stair That is climbed by the rainbow-clad spirits of prayer. AN ARGUMENT I. The Voice of the Man Impatient with Visions and Utopias We find your soft Utopias as white As new-cut bread, and dull as life in cells, O scribes who dare forget how wild we are, How human breasts adore alarum bells. You house us in a hive of prigs and saints Communal, frugal, clean and chaste by law. I'd rather brood in bloody Elsinore Or be Lear's fool, straw-crowned amid the straw. Promise us all our share in Agincourt Say that our clerks shall venture scorns and death, That future ant-hills will not be too good For Henry Fifth, or Hotspur, or Macbeth. Promise that through tomorrow's spirit-war Man's deathless soul will hack and hew its way, Each flaunting CÃ¦sar climbing to his fate Scorning the utmost steps of yesterday. Never a shallow jester any more! Let not Jack Falstaff spill the ale in vain. Let Touchstone set the fashions for the wise And Ariel wreak his fancies through the rain. II. The Rhymer's Reply: Incense and Splendor Incense and Splendor haunt me as I go. Though my good works have been, alas, too few, Though I do naught, High Heaven comes down to me, And future ages pass in tall review. I see the years to come as armies vast, Stalking tremendous through the fields of time. Man is unborn. Tomorrow he is born, Flame-like to hover o'er the moil and grime, Striving, aspiring till the shame is gone, Sowing a million flowers where now we mournâ Laying new, precious pavements with a song, Founding new shrines the good streets to adorn. I have seen lovers by those new-built walls Clothed like the dawn in orange, gold and red. Eyes flashing forth the glory-light of love Under the wreath that crowned each royal head. Life was made greater by their sweetheart prayers. Passion was turned to civic strength that dayâ Piling the marbles, making fairer domes With zeal that else had burned bright youth away. I have seen priestesses of life go by, Gliding in samite through the incense-seaâ Innocent children marching with them there, Singing in flowered robes, âThe EARTH IS FREEâ: While on the fair, deep-carved unfinished towers Sentinels watched in armor, night and dayâ Guarding the brazier-fires of hope and dreamâ Wild was their peace, and dawn-bright their array! THE NORTH STAR WHISPERS TO THE BLACKSMITH'S SON The North Star whispers: âYou are one Of those whose course no chance can change. You blunder, but are not undone, Your spirit-task is fixed and strange. âWhen here you walk, a bloodless shade, A singer all men else forget. Your chants of hammer, forge and spade Will move the prairie-village yet. âThat young, stiff-necked, reviling town Beholds your fancies on her walls, And paints them out or tears them down, Or bars them from her feasting-halls. âYet shall the fragments still remain; Yet shall remain some watch-tower strong That ivy-vines will not disdain, Haunted and trembling with your song. âYour flambeau in the dusk shall burn, Flame high in storms, flame white and clear; Your ghost in gleaming robes return And burn a deathless incense here.â THE PRAIRIE BATTLEMENTS (To Edgar Lee Masters, with great respect) Here upon the prairie Is our ancestral hall. Agate is the dome, Cornelian the wall. Ghouls are in the cellar, But fays upon the stairs. And here lived old King Silver Dreams, Always at his prayers. Here lived gray Queen Silver Dreams, Always singing psalms, And haughty Grandma Silver Dreams, Throned with folded palms. Here played cousin Alice. Her soul was best of all. And every fairy loved her, In our ancestral hall. Alice has a prairie grave. The King and Queen lie low, And aged Grandma Silver Dreams, Four tombstones in a row. But still in snow and sunshine Stands our ancestral hall. Agate is the dome, Cornelian the wall. And legends walk about, And proverbs, with proud airs. Ghouls are in the cellar, But fays upon the stairs. THE DREAM OF ALL THE SPRINGFIELD WRITERS I'll haunt this town, though gone the maids and men, The darling few, my friends and loves today. My ghost returns, bearing a great sword-pen When far-off children of their children play. That pen will drip with moonlight and with fire. I'll write upon the church-doors and the walls. And reading there, young hearts shall leap the higher Though drunk already with their own love-calls. Still led of love and arm in arm, strange gold Shall find in tracing the far-speeding track The dauntless war-cries that my sword-pen bold Shall carve on terraces and tree-trunks blackâ On tree-trunks black beneath the blossoms white:â Just as the phosphorent merman, bound for home Jewels his fire-path in the tides at night While hurrying sea-babes follow through the foam. And in December when the leaves are dead And the first snow has carpeted the street While young cheeks flush a healthful Christmas red And young eyes glisten with youth's fervor sweetâ My pen shall cut in winter's snowy floor Cries that in channeled glory leap and shine, My Village Gospel, living evermore Amid rejoicing, loyal friends of mine. THE HEARTH ETERNAL There dwelt a widow learned and devout, Behind our hamlet on the eastern hill. Three sons she had, who went to find the world. They promised to return, but wandered still. The cities used them well, they won their way: Rich gifts they sent, to still their mother's sighs. Worn out with honors and apart from her, They died as many a self-made exile dies. The mother had a hearth that would not quench, The deathless embers fought the creeping gloom. She said to us who came with wondering eyesâ âThis is a magic fire, a magic room.â The pine burned out, but still the coals glowed on. Her grave grew old beneath the pear-tree shade, And yet her crumbling home enshrined the light. The neighbors peering in were half afraid. Then sturdy beggars, needing fagots, came, One at a time, and stole the walls and floor. They left a naked stone, but how it blazed! And in the thunderstorm it flared the more. And now it was that men were heard to say, âThis light should be beloved by all the town.â At last they made the slope a place of prayer, Where marvellous thoughts from God came sweeping down. They left their churches crumbling in the sun, They met on that soft hill, one brotherhood; One strength and valor only, one delight, One laughing, brooding genius great and good. Now many gray-haired prodigals come home. The place out-flames the cities of the land, And twice-born Brahmans reach us from afar, With subtle eyes prepared to understand. Higher and higher burns the eastern steep, Showing the roads that march from every place, A steady beacon o'er the weary leagues, At dead of night it lights the traveller's face! Thus has the widow conquered half the earth, She who increased in faith, though all alone, Who kept her empty house a magic place, Has made the town a holy angel's throne. THE TOWN OF AMERICAN VISIONS (Springfield, Illinois) Is it for naught that where the tired crowds see Only a place for trade, a teeming square, Doors of high portent open unto me Carved with great eagles, and with hawthorns rare? Doors I proclaim, for there are rooms forgot Ripened through Ã¦ons by the good and wise: Walls set with Art's own pearl and amethyst Angel-wrought hangings there, and heaven-hued dyes:â Dazzling the eye of faith, the hope-filled heart: Rooms rich in records of old deeds sublime: Books that hold garnered harvests of far lands, Pictures that tableau Man's triumphant climb: Statues so white, so counterfeiting life, Bronze so ennobled, so with glory fraught That the tired eyes must weep with joy to see And the tired mind in Beauty's net be caught. Come enter there, and meet Tomorrow's Man, Communing with him softly day by day. Ah, the deep vistas he reveals, the dream Of angel-bands in infinite arrayâ Bright angel-bands, that dance in paths of earth When our despairs are gone, long overpastâ When men and maidens give fair hearts to Christ And white streets flame in righteous peace at last. THE SPRINGFIELD OF THE FAR FUTURE Some day our town will grow old. âShe is wicked and raw,â men say, âAwkward and brash and profane.â But the years have a healing way. The years of God are like bread, Balm of Gilead and sweet. And the soul of this little town Our Father will make complete. Some day our town will grow old, Filled with the fullness of time, Treasure on treasure heaped Of beauty's tradition sublime. Proud and gay and gray Like Hannah with Samuel blest. Humble and girlish and white Like Mary, the manger guest. Like Mary the manger queen Bringing the God of Light Till Christmas is here indeed And earth has no more of night, And hosts of Magi come, The wisest under the sun Bringing frankincense and praise For her gift of the Infinite One. OUR GUARDIAN ANGELS AND THEIR CHILDREN Where a river roars in rapids And doves in maples fret, Where peace has decked the pastures Our guardian angels met. Long they had sought each other In God's mysterious name, Had climbed the solemn chaos tides Alone, with hope aflame: Amid the demon deeps had wound By many a fearful way. As they beheld each other Their shout made glad the day. No need of purse delayed them, No hand of friend or kinâ Nor menace of the bell and book, Nor fear of mortal sin. You did not speak, my girl, At this, our parting hour. Long we held each other And watched their deeds of power. They made a curious Eden. We saw that it was good. We thought with them in unison. We proudly understood Their amaranth eternal, Their roses strange and fair, The asphodels they scattered Upon the living air. They built a house of clouds With skilled immortal hands. They entered through the silver doors. Their wings were wedded brands. I labored up the valley To granite mountains free. You hurried down the river To Zidon by the sea. But at their place of meeting They keep a home and shrine. Your angel twists a purple flax, Then weaves a mantle fine. My angel, her defender Upstanding, spreads the light On painted clouds of fancy And mists that touch the height. Their sturdy babes speak kindly And fly and run with joy, Shepherding the helpless lambsâ A Grecian girl and boy. These children visit Heaven Each year and make of worth All we planned and wrought in youth And all our tears on earth. From books our God has written They sing of high desire. They turn the leaves in gentleness. Their wings are folded fire. THE EMPTY BOATS Why do I see these empty boats, sailing on airy seas? One haunted me the whole night long, swaying with every breeze, Returning always near the eaves, or by the skylight glass: There it will wait me many weeks, and then, at last, will pass. Each soul is haunted by a ship in which that soul might ride And climb the glorious mysteries of Heaven's silent tide In voyages that change the very metes and bounds of Fateâ O empty boats, we all refuse, that by our windows wait! HOW I WALKED ALONE IN THE JUNGLES OF HEAVEN Oh, once I walked in Heaven, all alone Upon the sacred cliffs above the sky. God and the angels and the gleaming saints Had journeyed out into the stars to die. They had gone forth to win far citizens, Bought at great price, bring happiness for all: By such a harvest make a holier town And put new life within old Zion's wall. Each chose a far-off planet for his home, Speaking of love and mercy, truth and right, Envied and cursed, thorn-crowned and scourged in time, Each tasted death on his appointed night. Then resurrection day from sphere to sphere Sped on, with all the Powers arisen again, While with them came in clouds recruited hosts Of sun-born strangers and of earth-born men. And on that day gray prophet saints went down And poured atoning blood upon the deep, Till every warrior of old Hell flew free And all the torture fires were laid asleep. And Hell's lost company I saw return Clear-eyed, with plumes of white, the demons bold Climbed with the angels now on Jacob's stair, And built a better Zion than the old. And yet I walked alone on azure cliffs A lifetime long, and loved each untrimmed vine: The rotted harps, the swords of rusted gold, The jungles of all Heaven then were mine. Oh mesas and throne-mountains that I found! Oh strange and shaking thoughts that touched me there, Ere I beheld the bright returning wings That came to spoil my secret, silent lair! ALEXANDER CAMPBELL âThe present material universe, yet unrevealed in all its area, in all its tenantries, in all its riches, beauty and grandeur, will be wholly regenerated. Of this fact we have full assurance since He that now sits upon the throne of the Universe has pledged His word for it, saying: âBehold I will create all things new,â consequently, ânew heavens, new earth,â consequently, new tenantries, new employments, new pleasures, new joys, new ecstasies. There is a fullness of joy, a fullness of glory, and a fullness of blessedness of which no living man however enlightened, however enlarged, however gifted, ever formed or entertained one adequate conception.â The above is the closing paragraph in Alexander Campbell's last essay in the Millennial Harbinger, which he had edited thirty-five years. This paragraph appeared November, 1865, four months before his death. I. My Fathers Came from Kentucky I was born in Illinois,â Have lived there many days. And I have Northern words, And thoughts, And ways. But my great-grandfathers came To the west with Daniel Boone, And taught his babes to read, And heard the redbird's tune; And heard the turkey's call, And stilled the panther's cry, And rolled on the blue-grass hills, And looked God in the eye. And feud and Hell were theirs; Love, like the moon's desire, Love like a burning-mine, Love like rifle-fire. I tell tales out of school Till these Yankees hate my style. Why should the young cad cry, Shout with joy for a mile? Why do I faint with love Till the prairies dip and reel? My heart is a kicking horse Shod with Kentucky steel. No drop of my blood from north Of Mason and Dixon's line. And this racer in my breast Tears my ribs for a sign. But I ran in Kentucky hills Last week. They were hearth and home. And the church at Grassy Springs, Under the redbird's wings Was peace and honeycomb. II. Written in a Year When Many of My People Died I have begun to count my dead. They wave green branches Around my head, Put their hands upon my shoulders, Stand behind me, Fly above meâ Presences that love me. They watch me daily, Murmuring, gravely, gaily, Praising, reproving, readily. And every year that company Grows the greater steadily. And every day I count my dead In robes of sunrise, blue and red. III. A Rhymed Address to All Renegade Campbellites, Exhorting Them to Return I O prodigal son, O recreant daughter, When broken by the death of a child You called for the graybeard Campbellite elder, Who spoke as of old in the wild. His voice held echoes of the deep woods of Kentucky. He towered in apostolic state, While the portrait of Campbell emerged from the dark: That genius beautiful and great. And millennial trumpets poised, half lifted, Millennial trumpets that wait. II Like the woods of old Kentucky The memories of childhood Arch up to where gold chariot wheels go ringing, To where the precious airs are terraces and roadways For witnesses to God, forever singing. Like Mammoth Cave, Kentucky, the memories of childhood Go in and in forever underground To river and fountain of whispering and mystery And many a haunted hall without a sound. To Indian hoards and carvings and graveyards unexplored. To pits so deep a torch turns to a star Whirling 'round and going down to the deepest rocks of earth, To the fiery roots of forests brave and far. III As I built cob-houses with small cousins on the floor: (The talk was not meant for me). Daguerreotypes shone. The back log sizzled And my grandmother traced the family tree. Then she swept to the proverbs of Campbell again. And we glanced at the portrait of that most benign of men Looking down through the evening gleam With a bit of Andrew Jackson's air, More of Henry Clay And the statesmen of Thomas Jefferson's day: With the face of age, And the flush of youth, And that air of going on, forever free. For once upon a time ... Long, long ago ... In the holy forest land There was a jolly pre-millennial band, When that text-armed apostle, Alexander Campbell Held deathless debate with the wicked âinfi-del.â The clearing was a picnic ground. Squirrels were barking. The seventeen-year locust charged by. Wild turkeys perched on high. And millions of wild pigeons Broke the limbs of trees, Then shut out the sun, as they swept on their way. But ah, the wilder dove of God flew down To bring a secret glory, and to stay, With the proud hunter-trappers, patriarchs that came To break bread together and to pray And oh the music of each living throbbing thing When Campbell arose, A pillar of fire, The great high priest of the Spring. He stepped from out the Brush Run Meeting House To make the big woods his cathedrals, The river his baptismal font, The rolling clouds his bells, The storming skies his waterfalls, His pastures and his wells. Despite all sternness in his word Richer grew the rushing blood Within our father's coldest thought. Imagination at the flood Made flowery all they heard. The deep communion cup Of the whole South lifted up. Who were the witnesses, the great cloud of witnesses With which he was compassed around? The heroes of faith from the days of Abraham Stood on that blue-grass groundâ While the battle-ax of thought Hewed to the bone That the utmost generation Till the world was set right Might have an America their own. For religion Dionysian Was far from Campbell's doctrine. He preached with faultless logic An American Millennium: The social order Of a realist and farmer With every neighbor Within stone wall and border. And the tongues of flame came down Almost in spite of him. And now all but that Pentecost is dim. IV I walk the forest by the Daniel Boone trail. By guide posts quaint. And the blazes are faint In the rough old bark Of silver poplars And elms once slim, Now monoliths tall. I walk the aisle, The cathedral hall That is haunted still With chariots dim, Whispering still With debate and call. I come to you from Campbell, Turn again, prodigal Haunted by his name! Artist, singer, builder, The forest's son or daughter! You, the blasphemer Will yet know repentance, And Campbell old and gray Will lead you to the dream-side Of a pennyroyal river. While your proud heart is shaken Your confession will be taken And your sins baptized away. You, statesman-philosopher, Sage with high conceit Who speak of revolutions, in long words, And guide the little world as best you may: I come to you from Campbell And say he rides your way And will wait with you the coming of his day. His horse still threads the forest, Though the storm be roaring down. ... Campbell enters now your log-house door. Indeed you make him welcome, after many years, While the children build cob-houses on the floor. Let a thousand prophets have their due. Let each have his boat in the sky. But you were born for his secular millennium With the old Kentucky forest blooming like Heaven, And the redbirds flying high. THE TALE OF THE TIGER TREE A Fantasy, dedicated to the little poet Alice Oliver Henderson, ten years old. The Fantasy shows how tiger-hearts are the cause of war in all ages. It shows how the mammoth forces may be either friends or enemies of the struggle for peace. It shows how the dream of peace is unconquerable and eternal. I Peace-of-the-Heart, my own for long, Whose shining hair the May-winds fan, Making it tangled as they can, A mystery still, star-shining yet, Through ancient ages known to me And now once more reborn with me:â This is the tale of the Tiger Tree A hundred times the height of a man, Lord of the race since the world began. This is my city Springfield, My home on the breast of the plain. The state house towers to heaven, By an arsenal gray as the rain ... And suddenly all is mist, And I walk in a world apart, In the forest-age when I first knelt down At your feet, O Peace-of-the-Heart. This is the wonder of twilight: Three times as high as the dome Tiger-striped trees encircle the town, Golden geysers of foam. While giant white parrots sail past in their pride. The roofs now are clouds and storms that they ride. And there with the huntsmen of mound-builder days Through jungle and meadow I stride. And the Tiger Tree leaf is falling around As it fell when the world began: Like a monstrous tiger-skin, stretched on the ground, Or the cloak of a medicine man. A deep-crumpled gossamer web, Fringed with the fangs of a snake. The wind swirls it down from the leperous boughs. It shimmers on clay-hill and lake, With the gleam of great bubbles of blood, Or coiled like a rainbow shell. ... I feast on the stem of the Leaf as I march. I am burning with Heaven and Hell. II The gray king died in his hour. Then we crowned you, the prophetess wise: Peace-of-the-Heart we deeply adored For the witchcraft hid in your eyes. Gift from the sky, overmastering all, You sent forth your magical parrots to call The plot-hatching prince of the tigers, To your throne by the red-clay wall. Thus came that genius insane: Spitting and slinking, Sneering and vain, He sprawled to your grassy throne, drunk on The Leaf, The drug that was cunning and splendor and grief. He had fled from the mammoth by day, He had blasted the mammoth by night, War was his drunkenness, War was his dreaming, War was his love and his play. And he hissed at your heavenly glory While his councillors snarled in delight, Asking in irony: âWhat shall we learn From this whisperer, fragile and white?â And had you not been an enchantress They would not have loitered to mock Nor spared your white parrots who walked by their paws With bantering venturesome talk. You made a white fire of The Leaf. You sang while the tiger-chiefs hissed. You chanted of âPeace to the wonderful world.â And they saw you in dazzling mist. And their steps were no longer insane, Kindness came down like the rain, They dreamed that like fleet young ponies they feasted On succulent grasses and grain. Then came the black-mammoth chief: Long-haired and shaggy and great, Proud and sagacious he marshalled his court: (You had sent him your parrots of state.) His trunk in rebellion upcurled, A curse at the tiger he hurled. Huge elephants trumpeted there by his side, And mastodon-chiefs of the world. But higher magic began. For the turbulent vassals of man. You harnessed their fever, you conquered their ire, Their hearts turned to flowers through holy desire, For their darling and star you were crowned, And their raging demons were bound. You rode on the back of the yellow-streaked king, His loose neck was wreathed with a mistletoe ring. Primordial elephants loomed by your side, And our clay-painted children danced by your path, Chanting the death of the kingdoms of wrath. You wrought until night with us all. The fierce brutes fawned at your call, Then slipped to their lairs, song-chained. And thus you sang sweetly, and reigned: âImmortal is the inner peace, free to beasts and men. Beginning in the darkness, the mystery will conquer, And now it comforts every heart that seeks for love again. And now the mammoth bows the knee, We hew down every Tiger Tree, We send each tiger bound in love and glory to his den, Bound in love ... and wisdom ... and glory, ... to his den.â III âBeware of the trumpeting swine,â Came the howl from the northward that night:â Twice-rebel tigers warning us still If we held not beside them it boded us ill. From the parrots translating the cry, And the apes in the trees came the whine: âBeware of the trumpeting swine. Beware of the faith of a mammoth.â âBeware of the faith of a tiger,â Came the roar from the southward that night. Trumpeting mammoths warning us still If we held not beside them it boded us ill. The frail apes wailed to us all, The parrots re-echoed the call: âBeware of the faith of a tiger.â From the heights of the forest the watchers could see The tiger-cats crunching the Leaf of the Tree Lashing themselves, and scattering foam, Killing our huntsmen, hurrying home. The chiefs of the mammoths our mastery spurned, And eastward restlessly fumed and burned. The peacocks squalled out the news of their drilling And told how they trampled, maneuvered, and turned. Ten thousand man-hating tigers Whirling down from the north, like a flood! Ten thousand mammoths oncoming From the south as avengers of blood! Our child-queen was mourning, her magic was dead, The roots of the Tiger Tree reeking with red. IV This is the tale of the Tiger Tree A hundred times the height of a man, Lord of the race since the world began. We marched to the mammoths, We pledged them our steel, And scorning you, sang:â âWe are men, We are men.â We mounted their necks, And they stamped a wide reel. We sang: âWe are fighting the hell-cats again, We are mound-builder men, We are elephant men.â We left you there, lonely, Beauty your power, Wisdom your watchman, To hold the clay tower. While the black-mammoths boomedâ âYou are elephant men, Men, Men, Elephant men.â The dawn-winds prophesied battles untold. While the Tiger Trees roared of the glories of old, Of the masterful spirits and hard. The drunken cats came in their joy In the sunrise, a glittering wave. âWe are tigers, are tigers,â they yowled. âDown, Down, Go the swine to the grave.â But we tramp Tramp Trampled them there, Then charged with our sabres and spears. The swish of the sabre, The swish of the sabre, Was a marvellous tune in our ears. We yelled âWe are men, We are men.â As we bled to death in the sun. ... Then staunched our horrible wounds With the cry that the battle was won. ... And at last, When the black-mammoth legion Split the night with their song:â âRight is braver than wrong, Right is stronger than wrong,â The buzzards came taunting: âDown from the north Tiger-nations are sweeping along.â Then we ate of the ravening Leaf As our savage fathers of old. No longer our wounds made us weak, No longer our pulses were cold. Though half of my troops were afoot (For the great who had borne them were slain), We dreamed we were tigers, and leaped And foamed with that vision insane. We cried, âWe are soldiers of doom, Doom, Sabres of glory and doom.â We wreathed the king of the mammoths In the tiger-leaves' terrible bloom. We flattered the king of the mammoths, Loud-rattling sabres and spears. The swish of the sabre, The swish of the sabre, Was a marvellous tune in his ears. V This was the end of the battle. The tigers poured by in a tide Over us all with their caterwaul call, âWe are the tigers,â They cried. âWe are the sabres,â They cried. But we laughed while our blades swept wide, While the dawn-rays stabbed through the gloom. âWe are suns of fireâ was our yellâ âSuns on fire.â ... But man-child and mastodon fell, Mammoth and elephant fell. The fangs of the devil-cats closed on the world, Plunged it to blackness and doom. The desolate red-clay wall Echoed the parrots' call:â âImmortal is the inner peace, free to beasts and men. Beginning in the darkness, the mystery will conquer, And now it comforts every heart that seeks for love again, And now the mammoth bows the knee, We hew down every Tiger Tree, We send each tiger bound in love and glory to his den, Bound in love ... and wisdom ... and glory, ... to his den.â A peacock screamed of his beauty On that broken wall by the trees, Chiding his little mate, Spreading his fans in the breeze ... And you, with eyes of a bride, Knelt on the wall at my side, The deathless song in your mouth ... A million new tigers swept south ... As we laughed at the peacock, and died. This is my vision in Springfield: Three times as high as the dome, Tiger-striped trees encircle the town, Golden geysers of foam;â Though giant white parrots sail past, giving voice, Though I walk with Peace-of-the-Heart and rejoice. THE SOUL OF A SPIDER The thing that eats the rotting stars On the black sea-beach of shame Is a giant spider's deathless soul, And Mammon is its name. THE SOUL OF A BUTTERFLY The thing that breaks Hell's prison bars, And heals the sea of shame, Is a fragile butterfly's great soul And Beauty is its name. HEART OF GOD O great heart of God, Once vague and lost to me, Why do I throb with your throb tonight, In this land, eternity? O little heart of God, Sweet intruding stranger, You are laughing in my human breast, A Christ-child in a manger. Heart, dear heart of God, Beside you now I kneel, Strong heart of faith. O heart not mine, Where God has set His seal. Wild thundering heart of God Out of my doubt I come, And my foolish feet with prophets' feet, March with the prophets' drum. SEW THE FLAGS TOGETHER (Written for William Stanley Braithwaite's Victory Anthology issued at once, after Armistice Day, November, 1918) Great wave of youth, ere you be spent, Sweep over every monument Of caste, smash every high imperial wall That stands against the new World State, And overwhelm each ravening hate, And heal, and make blood-brothers of us all. Nor let your clamor cease Till ballots conquer guns. Drum on for the world's peace Till the Tory power is gone. Envenomed lame old age Is not our heritage, But springtime's vast release, and flaming dawn. Peasants, rise in splendor And your accounting render Ere the lords unnerve your hand! Sew the flags together. Do not tear them down. Hurl the worlds together. Dethrone the wallowing monster And the clown. Resolving:â âOnly that shall grow In Balkan furrow, Chinese row, That blooms, and is perpetually young.â That only be held fine and dear That brings heart-wisdom year by year And puts this thrilling word upon the tongue: âThe United States of Europe, Asia, and the World.â âYouth will be served,â now let us cry. Hurl the referendum. Your fathers, five long years ago, Resolved to strike, too late. Now Sun-crowned crowds Innumerable, Of boys and girls Imperial, With your patchwork flag of brotherhood On high, With every silk In one flower-banner whirledâ Rise, Citizens of one tremendous state, The United States of Europe, Asia, and the World. The dawn is rose-drest and impearled. The guards of privilege are spent. The blood-fed captains nod. So Saxon, Slav, French, German, Rise, Yankee, Chinese, Japanese, All the lands, all the seas, With the blazing rainbow flag unfurled, Rise, rise, Take the sick dragons by surprise, Highly establish, In the name of God, The United States of Europe, Asia, and the World. I HEARD IMMANUEL SINGING The poem shows the Master with his work done, singing to free his heart in Heaven. This poem is intended to be half said, half sung, very softly, to the well-known tune:â âLast night I lay a-sleeping, There came a dream so fair, I stood in Old Jerusalem Beside the temple there,ââ etc. Yet this tune is not to be fitted on, arbitrarily. It is here given to suggest the manner of handling rather than determine it. I heard Immanuel singing To be sung. Within his own good lands, I saw him bend above his harp. I watched his wandering hands Lost amid the harp-strings; Sweet, sweet I heard him play. His wounds were altogether healed. Old things had passed away. All things were new, but music. The blood of David ran Within the Son of David, Our God, the Son of Man. He was ruddy like a shepherd. His bold young face, how fair. Apollo of the silver bow Had not such flowing hair. I saw Immanuel singing To be read very softly, but in spirited response. On a tree-girdled hill. The glad remembering branches Dimly echoed still The grand new song proclaiming The Lamb that had been slain. New-built, the Holy City Gleamed in the murmuring plain. The crowning hours were over. The pageants all were past. Within the many mansions The hosts, grown still at last, In homes of holy mystery Slept long by crooning springs Or waked to peaceful glory, A universe of Kings. He left his people happy. To be sung. He wandered free to sigh Alone in lowly friendship With the green grass and the sky. He murmured ancient music His red heart burned to sing Because his perfect conquest Had grown a weary thing. No chant of gilded triumphâ His lonely song was made Of Art's deliberate freedom; Of minor chords arrayed In soft and shadowy colors That once were radiant flowers:â The Rose of Sharon, bleeding In Olive-shadowed bowers:â And all the other roses In the songs of East and West Of love and war and worshipping, And every shield and crest Of thistle or of lotus Or sacred lily wrought In creeds and psalms and palaces And temples of white thought:â All these he sang, half-smiling To be read very softly, yet in spirited response. And weeping as he smiled, Laughing, talking to his harp As to a new-born child:â As though the arts forgotten But bloomed to prophecy These careless, fearless harp-strings, New-crying in the sky. âWhen this his hour of sorrow To be sung. For flowers and Arts of men Has passed in ghostly music,â I asked my wild heart thenâ What will he sing tomorrow, What wonder, all his own Alone, set free, rejoicing With a green hill for his throne? What will he sing tomorrow What wonder all his own Alone, set free, rejoicing, With a green hill for his throne? SECTION IX POLITICS THE JINGO AND THE MINSTREL An Argument for the Maintenance of Peace and Goodwill with the Japanese People Glossary for the uninstructed and the hasty: Jimmu Tenno, ancestor of all the Japanese Emperors; Nikko, Japan's loveliest shrine; Iyeyasu, her greatest statesman; Bushido, her code of knighthood; The Forty-seven Ronins, her classic heroes; Nogi, her latest hero; Fuji, her most beautiful mountain. The Pendragon flag is King Arthur's Banner (see Tennyson). âNow do you know of Avalon The minstrel speaks. That sailors call Japan? She holds as rare a chivalry As ever bled for man. King Arthur sleeps at Nikko hill Where Iyeyasu lies, And there the broad Pendragon flag In deathless splendor flies.â âNay, minstrel, but the great ships come The jingo answers. From out the sunset sea. We cannot greet the souls they bring With welcome high and free. How can the Nippon nondescripts, That weird and dreadful band, Be aught but what we find them here:â The blasters of the land?â âFirst race, first men from anywhere The minstrel replies. To face you, eye to eye. For that do you curse Avalon And raise a hue and cry? These toilers cannot kiss your hand, Or fawn with hearts bowed down. Be glad for them, and Avalon, And Arthur's ghostly crown. âNo doubt your guests, with sage debate, In grave things gentlemen, Will let your trade and farms alone, And turn them back again. But why should brawling braggarts rise With hasty words of shame, To drive them back, like dogs and swine, Who in due honor came?â âWe cannot give them honor, sir. The jingo answers. We give them scorn for scorn. And Rumor steals around the world, All white-skinned men to warn Against this sleek silk-merchant here And viler coolie-man, And wrath within the courts of war Brews on against Japan!â âMust Avalon, with hope forlorn, The minstrel replies. Her back against the wall, Have lived her brilliant life in vain While ruder tribes take all? Must Arthur stand with Asian Celts, A ghost with spear and crown, Behind the great Pendragon flag And be again cut down? âTho' Europe's self shall move against High Jimmu Tenno's throne, The Forty-seven Ronin Men Will not be found alone. For Percival and Bedivere And Nogi side by side Will stand,âwith mourning Merlin there, Tho' all go down in pride. âBut has the world the envious dreamâ Ah, such things cannot be,â To tear their fairy-land like silk And toss it in the sea? Must this day rob the future day, The ultimate world-man, Of rare Bushido, code of codes, The fair heart of Japan? âGo, be the guest of Avalon. Believe me it lies there Behind the mighty gray sea-wall Where heathen bend in prayer: Where peasants lift adoring eyes To Fuji's crown of snow. King Arthur's knights will be your hosts, So cleanse your heart, and go. âAnd you will find but gardens sweet Prepared beyond the seas, And you will find but gentlefolk Beneath the cherry-trees. So walk you worthy of your Christ The church bells do not sound, And weave the bands of brotherhood On Jimmu Tenno's ground.â YANKEE DOODLE This poem is intended as a description of a sort of Blashfield mural painting on the sky. To be sung to the tune of Yankee Doodle, yet in a slower, more orotund fashion. It is presumably an exercise for an entertainment on the evening of Washington's Birthday. Dawn this morning burned all red; Watching then, in wonder There I saw our spangled flag Divide the clouds asunder. Then there followed Washington. Ah, he rode from glory, Cold and mighty as his name And stern as Freedom's story. Unsubdued by burning dawn Led his continentals. Vast they were, and strange to see In gray old regimentals:â Marching still with bleeding feet, Bleeding feet and jestingâ Marching from the judgment throne With energy unresting. How their merry quickstep playedâ Silver, sharp, sonorous, Piercing through with prophecy The demons' rumbling chorusâ Behold the ancient powers of sin And slavery before them!â Sworn to stop the glorious dawn, The pit-black clouds hung o'er them. Plagues that rose to blast the day Fiend and tiger faces, Monsters plotting bloodshed for The patient toiling races. Round the dawn their cannon raged, Hurling bolts of thunder, Yet before our spangled flag Their host was cut asunder. Like a mist they fled away. ... Ended wrath and roaring. Still our restless soldier-host From East to West went pouring. High beside the sun of noon They bore our banner splendid. All its days of stain and shame And heaviness were ended. Men were swelling now the throng From great and lowly stationâ Valiant citizens today Of every tribe and nation. Not till night their rear-guard came, Down the west went marching, And left behind the sunset-rays In beauty overarching. War-god banners lead us still, Rob, enslave and harry Let us rather choose today The flag the angels carryâ Flag we love, but brighter farâ Soul of it made splendid: Let its days of stain and shame And heaviness be ended. Let its fifes fill all the sky, Redeemed souls marching after, Hills and mountains shake with song, While seas roll on in laughter. THE TIGER ON PARADE The Sparrow and the Robin on a toot Drunk on honey-dew and violet's breath Came knocking at the brazen bars of Death. And Death, no other than a tiger caged, In a street parade that had no ending, Roared at them and clawed at them and ragedâ Whose chirping was the height of their offending. His paws too bigâtheir fluttering bodies small Escaped unscathed above the City Hall. They learned new dances, scattering birdy laughter, And filled again their throats with honey-dew. A Maltese kitten killed them, two days after. But they had had their fill. It was enough:â Had quarrelled, made up, on many a lilac swayed, Darted through sunny thunder-clouds and rainbows, High above that tiger on parade. TO JANE ADDAMS AT THE HAGUE (Two poems, written on the sinking of the Lusitania, appearing in the Chicago Herald, May 11, 1915) I. Speak Now for Peace Lady of Light, and our best woman, and queen, Stand now for peace (though anger breaks your heart), Though naught but smoke and flame and drowning is seen. Lady of Light, speak, though you speak alone, Though your voice may seem as a dove's in this howling flood, It is heard tonight by every senate and throne. Though the widening battle of millions and millions of men Threatens tonight to sweep the whole of the earth, Back of the smoke is the promise of kindness again. II. Tolstoi Is Plowing Yet Tolstoi is plowing yet. When the smoke-clouds break, High in the sky shines a field as wide as the world. There he toils for the Kingdom of Heaven's sake. Ah, he is taller than clouds of the little earth. Only the congress of planets is over him, And the arching path where new sweet stars have birth. Wearing his peasant dress, his head bent low, Tolstoi, that angel of Peace, is plowing yet; Forward across the field, his horses go. A CURSE FOR KINGS A curse upon each king who leads his state, No matter what his plea, to this foul game, And may it end his wicked dynasty, And may he die in exile and black shame. If there is vengeance in the Heaven of Heavens, What punishment could Heaven devise for these Who fill the rivers of the world with dead, And turn their murderers loose on all the seas! Put back the clock of time a thousand years, And make our Europe, once the world's proud Queen, A shrieking strumpet, furious fratricide, Eater of entrails, wallowing obscene In pits where millions foam and rave and bark, Mad dogs and idiots, thrice drunk with strife; While Science towers above;âa witch, red-winged: Science we looked to for the light of life. Curse me the men who make and sell iron ships, Who walk the floor in thought, that they may find Each powder prompt, each steel with fearful edge, Each deadliest device against mankind. Curse me the sleek lords with their plumes and spurs, May Heaven give their land to peasant spades, Give them the brand of Cain, for their pride's sake, And felon's stripes for medals and for braids. Curse me the fiddling, twiddling diplomats, Haggling here, plotting and hatching there, Who make the kind world but their game of cards, Till millions die at turning of a hair. What punishment will Heaven devise for these Who win by others' sweat and hardihood, Who make men into stinking vultures' meat, Saying to evil still âBe thou my goodâ? Ah, he who starts a million souls toward death Should burn in utmost hell a million years! âMothers of men go on the destined wrack To give them life, with anguish and with tears:â Are all those childbed sorrows sneered away? Yea, fools laugh at the humble christenings, And cradle-joys are mocked of the fat lords: These mothers' sons made dead men for the Kings! All in the name of this or that grim flag, No angel-flags in all the rag-arrayâ Banners the demons love, and all Hell sings And plays wild harps. Those flags march forth today! ABOVE THE BATTLE'S FRONT St. Francis, Buddha, Tolstoi, and St. Johnâ Friends, if you four, as pilgrims, hand in hand, Returned, the hate of earth once more to dare, And walked upon the water and the land, If you, with words celestial, stopped these kings For sober conclave, ere their battle great, Would they for one deep instant then discern Their crime, their heart-rot, and their fiend's estate? If you should float above the battle's front, Pillars of cloud, of fire that does not slay, Bearing a fifth within your regal train, The Son of David in his strange arrayâ If, in his majesty, he towered toward Heaven, Would they have hearts to see or understand? ... Nay, for he hovers there tonight, we know, Thorn-crowned above the water and the land. WHO KNOWS? They say one king is mad. Perhaps. Who knows? They say one king is doddering and gray. They say one king is slack and sick of mind, A puppet for hid strings that twitch and play. Is Europe then to be their sprawling-place? Their madhouse, till it turns the wide world's bane? Their place of maudlin, slavering conference Till every far-off farmstead goes insane? THE UNPARDONABLE SIN This is the sin against the Holy Ghost:â To speak of bloody power as right divine, And call on God to guard each vile chief's house, And for such chiefs, turn men to wolves and swine:â To go forth killing in White Mercy's name, Making the trenches stink with spattered brains, Tearing the nerves and arteries apart, Sowing with flesh the unreaped golden plains. In any Church's name, to sack fair towns, And turn each home into a screaming sty, To make the little children fugitive, And have their mothers for a quick death cry,â This is the sin against the Holy Ghost: This is the sin no purging can atone:â To send forth rapine in the name of Christ:â To set the face, and make the heart a stone. THE MERCIFUL HAND (Written to Miss Alice L. F. Fitzgerald, Edith Cavell memorial nurse, going to the front) Your fine white hand is Heaven's gift To cure the wide world, stricken sore, Bleeding at the breast and head, Tearing at its wounds once more. Your white hand is a prophecy, A living hope that Christ shall come And make the nations merciful, Hating the bayonet and drum. Each desperate burning brain you soothe, Or ghastly broken frame you bind, Brings one day nearer our bright goal, The love-alliance of mankind. Wellesley, February, 1916. IN WHICH ROOSEVELT IS COMPARED TO SAUL (Written and published in 1913, and republished five years later, in the Boston Transcript, on the death of Roosevelt) Where is David? ... Oh God's people Saul has passed, the good and great. Mourn for Saul, the first anointed, Head and shoulders o'er the state. He was found among the prophets: Judge and monarch, merged in one. But the wars of Saul are ended, And the works of Saul are done. Where is David, ruddy-shepherd, God's boy-king for Israel? Mystic, ardent, dowered with beauty, Singing where still waters dwell? Prophet, find that destined minstrel Wandering on the range today, Driving sheep, and crooning softly Psalms that cannot pass away. âDavid waits,â the prophet answers, âIn a black, notorious den, In a cave upon the border, With four hundred outlaw men. âHe is fair and loved of women, Mighty-hearted, born to sing: Thieving, weeping, erring, praying, Radiant royal rebel-king. âHe will come with harp and psaltry, Quell his troop of convict swine, Quell his mad-dog roaring rascals, Witching them with tunes divine. âThey will ram the walls of Zion. They will win us Salem hill, All for David, shepherd David, Singing like a mountain rill.â HAIL TO THE SONS OF ROOSEVELT âOut of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness.ââ Samson's riddle. There is no name for brother Like the name of Jonathan The son of Saul. And so we greet you all: The sons of Rooseveltâ The sons of Saul. Four brother Jonathans went out to battle. Let every Yankee poet sing their praise Through all the daysâ What David sang of Saul And Jonathan, beloved more than all. God grant such sons, begot of our young men, To make each generation glad again. Let sons of Saul be springing up again: Out of the eater, fire and power again. From the lost lion, honey for all men. I hear the sacred Rocky Mountains call, I hear the Mississippi Jordan call: âStand up, America, and praise them all, Living and dead, the fine young sons of Saul!â IN MEMORY OF MY FRIEND, JOYCE KILMER, POET AND SOLDIER (Written Armistice Day, November eleventh, 1918) I hear a thousand chimes, I hear ten thousand chimes, I hear a million chimes In Heaven. I see a thousand bells, I see ten thousand bells, I see a million bells In Heaven. Listen, friends and companions. Through the deep heart, Sweetly they toll. I hear the chimes Of tomorrow ring, The azure bells Of eternal love. ... I see the chimes Of tomorrow swing: On unseen ropes They gleam above. Rejoice, friends and companions. Through the deep heart Sweetly they toll. They shake the sky They blaze and sing. They fill the air Like larks a-wing, Like storm-clouds Turned to blue-bell flowers. Like Spring gone mad, Like stars in showers. Join the song, Friends and companions. Through the deep heart Sweetly they toll. And some are near, And touch my hand, Small whispering blooms From Beulah Land. Giants afar Still touch the sky, Still give their giant Battle-cry. Join hands, friends and companions. Through the deep heart Sweetly they toll. And every bell Is voice and breath Of a spirit Who has conquered death, In this great war Has given all, Like Kilmer Heard the hero-call. Join hands, Poets, Friends, Companions. Through the deep heart Sweetly they toll! WHERE IS THE REAL NON-RESISTANT? (Matthew V, 38â48.) Who can surrender to Christ, dividing his best with the stranger, Giving to each what he asks, braving the uttermost danger All for the enemy, Man? Who can surrender till death His words and his works, his house and his lands, His eyes and his heart and his breath? Who can surrender to Christ? Many have yearned toward it daily. Yet they surrender to passion, wildly or grimly or gaily: Yet they surrender to pride, counting her precious and queenly; Yet they surrender to knowledge, preening their feathers serenely. Who can surrender to Christ? Where is the man so transcendent, So heated with love of his kind, so filled with the spirit resplendent That all of the hours of his day song thrilling and tender, And all of his thoughts to our white cause of peace Surrender, surrender, surrender? THE WIZARD WIND THE WIZARD WIND'S A FRIEND OF MINEâMOST INTIMATE IN TRUTH! HE WHISTLES SORROW HALF AWAY, HE GIVES ME GOLDEN YOUTH. AND FREE AS THAT SMALL BIRD THAT EATS THE WHEAT EAR IN THE SHEAF I AM NO LONGER MAN, BUT CLOUD, OR TUMBLED MAPLE LEAF. ONCE HE TRANSFORMED ME TO A BEE, HUNGRY FOR HONEY DEW. HE BLEW ME TO A WINDLAND BUSH; WITH SPEED AND JOY WE FLEW. THE GREAT BUSH BLOOMED WITH PARCHMENTS FINE, OR SONGS THAT FEED THE SOUL, ALL NEW, THAT OUR DEAR EARTH SHALL HEAR, WHEN POETS REACH THEIR GOAL: WHEN OUR GROWN CHILDREN, BREATHING FIRE SHALL JUSTIFY ALL TIME BY HYMNS OF LIVING SILVER, SONGS WITH SUNRISE IN THE RHYME. I WISH THAT I HAD LEARNED BY HEART SOME LYRICS READ THAT DAY. I KNEW NOT 'TWAS A GIANT HOUR, AND SPENT IT ALL IN PLAY. WINDLAND GLEAMS SO DEWY-WHITE, SO FULL OF CRYSTAL PEACE! AND EVERY LEAF OF SILKEN HARP, WHOSE MURMURS WILL NOT CEASE! I GORGED THE HONEY FROM THE CUPS OF WILD FLOWERS ALL ABOUT; LAUGHING WHEN THE WIZARD LAUGHED AND PUT THE GNATS TO ROUT. I READ ONCE MORE, THEN SLEPT A WHILE, THEN WOKE ON EARTH AGAIN. I WISH THOSE SCROLLS WERE MINE, THAT I MIGHT BRING THEM UNTO MEN. I WISH THE VILLAGE MAGAZINE HELD ONLY SONGS AS RARE EACH WORD A SPIRIT-WONDERLAND OF PERFUME FIRE AND AIR. SECTION X SONGS BASED ON CARTOONS, BILL-BOARDS, AND AMERICAN HIEROGLYPHICS, AND MOTION-PICTURES ROOSEVELT (Written for the Illinois State Teachers' Association, printed as a broadside, and read, and distributed the same day: April 4, 1924.) When the stuffed prophets quarrel, when the sawdust comes out, I think of Roosevelt's genuine sins. Once more my rash love for that cinnamon bear, Begins! His sins were better than their sweetest goodness. His blows were cleaner than their plainest kindness. He saw more than they all, in his hours of black blindness. The hour of his pitiful spiritual fall He was more of an angel than all of this host, When with Lucifer's pride his soul was burnt out, When, still in the game, he gave up the ghost. His yarns were nearer the sky than their truth. His wildest tales, in his fish-story hour, Nearer true than their truth. When with art and with laughter he held supreme power, He was white as the moon, and as honest as youth. And now their sworn word is but barnyard mud. And their highest pride is to hide in a hole. They talk of âdollars,â and âdollarsâ and âdollarsâ And âdollarsâ and âdollars,â and hate his clean soul. (Oh money, moneyâthat never can think, Money, money, that never can rule, Always an anarchist, always an idiot, Always King Logânever King Stork, Always rotting, reeking:âalways a fool.) Roosevelt was proud like a singer. Roosevelt's pride was that of a scribe, Or the pride of a father, the pride of a ruler, The pride of the thoroughbred chief of a tribe, The pride of Confucius, the pride of a student! He hated a coward, he hated a fool, He knew that money is always a fool. When they tear each others' newspaper-hearts I think of Theodore's genuine code. He hated the paste-board, the smeary, the fake. He hated the snake, the frog and the toad. Oh a moose with sharp antlers! Oh a panther of panthersâOh a fox of foxes Often caught in tight boxes! Yet we know he would always bark out the truth. He loved the curious political game:â But we know he loved better:âtruth, God, and youth. A peacock of peacocks! An eagle of eagles! Defeating, within himself, the quick fox. A buffalo roaringâa world-lion roaring! Defeating within himself the bright fox,â Then ranging out through the wilderness trail, Killing the jackalâfelling the ox. Megalomaniac, envious, glorious, Envying only the splendors of worth. Emulating the cleanest on earth, (Those who were, therefore, the strongest on earth.) Emulating thoroughbredsâalways. Peacock! Lion! Cinnamon bear! Skyscrapersâsteeples and plains for abode! He was mostly the world's fine cinnamon bear, He was mostly our glittering cinnamon bear, Sitting there in an old rocking chair, In the White House yard, taking the air. He told us Aesop's new fables, each dayâ President seven big glorious years! Seven years of wonder. Must they all fade away, In the quarrels of the rat with the loud-voiced cootie Told by the zinc-throated, varnished âloud-speaker,â Told by wireless, while the world sits breathless, Or by megaphone, By line-o'-type, or by letter ripe:â The quarrels of the angle-worm with the toad? Who elected these pole-cats rulers of men? Let us start a gay nation over again! Let us start a circus as honest as Barnum's, With three clean rings, and plenty to see, Athletes, not snakes, on the trapeze tree. Let us start our nation over again, In the names of legitimate rulers of men, In the names of the great, and the famous dead:â Yes, the name of the glittering cinnamon bear, Never so wicked or sore in the head, But he fed the children honey and bread. He taught them the names of the great and the dead, From the Irish Sagas, to Carson and Boone. He loved the villages, Deadwood, Medora, Tuskeegee and Tuscarora, Mexicali and Farmington, Calexico and Bennington, Arlington and Lexington, Oyster Bay, Mount Vernon. He loved the cities Denver, Manhattan, And the wide great spaces From the Amazon to Saskatoonâ He loved the heroes, Columbus, Whitman, Lincoln, He loved the heroes! He loved George Washington!â Who was honest as youth and white as the moon. âGreat-heart!â Roosevelt! Father of men! He fed the children honey and bread. He taught them the Ten Commandments and prayer, Rocking there in his old rocking chair, Or riding the storms of dream that he rode. Join hands, poets, friends, companions! Let us start a new world on the Roosevelt Code! Let us start our nation over again In the name of the honest, proud cinnamon bear, Rocking there in his old rocking chair Or riding the terrible storms that he rode! The most-quoted phrase from the first edition of this book is on page 2ââThat this whole book is a weapon in a strenuous battlefield.â So this section starts with two broadsides, carrying out that idea, one on Roosevelt, one on Sandburg. âRooseveltâ was written, printed and issued in one day, after reading of the behavior of two middle western governors, that morning. I read the poem that night in East St. Louis for the Illinois State Teachers' Association, three thousand strong. It was distributed by the Doubleday Page Book Shop, St. Louis. I read it in the loudest voice I could muster, holding the broadside up before the convention like a banner. It was an occasion of some humor, but of even more seriousness, and the New Republic telegraphed for a copy of the broadside at once, and reissued it in abbreviated form. In this form it was quoted with apparent approval by the Philadelphia North American, and sent for by the Roosevelt Memorial Association to be fastened on their walls. And the same day it was politically attacked by the earnest Providence (Rhode Island) Journal. BABYLON, BABYLON, BABYLON THE GREAT (Inscribed to Carl Sandburg) This poem is based on the episode of âLincoln's Lost Speech,â too dangerous to print at the time, at Cooper Union, his first appearance in the East. Isaiah, the country-boy, marched against the jazzâ Babylon the shrewd and slick, Babylon the great. Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, walked alone, Alone against Babylon, alone against fate. St. Paul walked alone, St. Peter walked alone, Against that town to marvel on, Babylon the great. Lincoln at Cooper Union, improvised and chanted, Threw away his speech, and told tales out of school, Changed from politician to God's divine fool. Beside himself, beyond himself, set his old heart free, The flame spread, the flame spread, every suppressed word was said, Isaiah's voice from the dead; Lincoln's great lost speech, nowhere written down, But it burned every gate of the famous old town. Lincoln at Cooper Union, called down fire from Heaven, Overthrew jazzâBabylon, Babylon the great. I have seen the burning of Babylon's gardens, Many and many a noble day. I have watched the ashes of that beautiful lost city, Blown through many a year away. Statesmen have torn down Babylon. ... The gophers have buried Babylon. ... Coyotes lope through Babylon. ... Prairie dogs bore the clay and sand. ... Texas cattle have trampled Babylon deeper in dung and dust. ... But forever stands Babylon, fresh in the sunrise, ... Foam upon the ocean ... or granite on the land, As new as the Devil, and the Devil's lust. How our tales of Babylon multiply upon the ranges! How old memories of victory renew! Except for the warfare of the youngsters against Babylon, The campfire songs would be few. Troubadour!âMarch with bleeding feet against Babylon!â (So, keep going to the sun! So, keep going to the sun!) âIf you would be a man.âAs these have done before! As lonely as Lincoln, dazed in Babylon, Plod, plod, with a heartache, through the Devil's own door! Tear up your set speeches, improvise once more! War must begin against that city's music, Soâsing a silly song. Say:ââThe sky is blue.â Sing a song of rainbow gems, unknown to Babylon. Then improvise a song of the mick who lifts the hod, Of the mick who sets in concrete the steel truss and rod, Who builds the auto highways across the prairie sodâ (So, keep going to the sun! So, keep going to the sun!) Improvise a cowboy song, of cactus and of dew, And of raging on a mustang across the alkali To where the snow-bright mountains of new mediation lie, To the Indian basket-flowers, the ferns, the meadow-rue;â Sing of beans in the pod, and of wheat in the shock, Of hay in the stack, and windmills in the air, Of castellated silos, and turkeys fat and fair, Of chickens and of guineas, of pheasants, quails and eagles, Of the High-School senior boys, foot-ball players, Sheiks and swells, Of Lincoln-highway roses and sweet lovers everywhere:â And the candies and the vanities of senior High-School belles, (So, keep going to the sun! So, keep going to the sun!) Sing a Kansas love-song, modest, clean and true. Sing a Kansas love-song, modest, clean and true. Then lift your psalm of the Manna of our God! It is the only way to go into Babylon, Call down fire from Heaven, and the world renew. This is the only way a bard is a man. So lift your proud word against the towers if you can. Go on, with your guitar, through the Devil's breezy gate. March on, with simple Lincoln against Babylon, Babylon,â His dog-eared carpet-bag crammed with state papers, His sweaty old duster flapping like a rag.â Go, with prairie Lincoln against Babylon, Babylon, Go with that tall prophet, again to Cooper Union, March with mighty Lincoln against Babylon the Great! (Soâkeep going to the sun! Soâkeep going to the sun!) In this poem I have exhorted Sandburg to improvise, but in a way the opposite of jazzâfor I have always hated jazz, as our most Babylonian disease. This poem originally appeared in Christopher Morley's Bowling Green column, in The New York Evening Post, to celebrate a visit of Carl Sandburg to New York City. Several months later it was printed in Memphis, Tennessee, by the author, in anticipation of Carl Sandburg's visit to address Memphis in a recital for the Goodwyn Institute, November 17, 1923. I issued it in a three-foot broadside, with my picture of Babylon at the top as a kind of hieroglyphic. It was distributed through the kindness of Mrs. Dicken's Book-Shop. PREFACE TO âBOB TAYLOR'S BIRTHDAYâ A Poem on âThe Tennessee Orpheusâ A Rhymed Oration. Being the Phi Beta Kappa Poem, Harvard Commencement, 1922. Robert Love Taylor, the twenty-seventh and thirtieth governor of Tennessee, was born in 1850, and died in 1912. He was the greatest State governor America has ever had, to me, a great statesman, indeed. This oration is dedicated to the boys and girls of Tennessee. It is intended to be read to a big crowd, out of doors, presumably July 1, Bob Taylor's birthday. If it is read while you sit down, in the house, it means nothing. Please, citizens of Tennessee, and others, assemble a concourse of neighbors with the children at a basket-picnic, on the Mississippi, the Tennessee, the Clinch or the Cumberland rivers, and read it so they all can hear, preferably after it is memorized, and every cadence adjusted and understood, as though they were all syllables of one musical word. After this kind of memorizing, it may be read slowly, as an oration, but not before. At natural intervals in the song, when finally given, let there be good tunes by a good picnic fiddler;âan old-fashioned, barn-dance, log cabin jig fiddler. At the proper moments solemn tunes, like âOld Hundred,â and famous dances like âMoney-Musk!â Then, after a moment's pause, let the orator resume, paraphrasing and improving on the poem, as he gets the swing. Please let the production be understood by the crowd as oratorical, to be cheerfully filled with local allusions, in the spirit of Taylor's own political speeches, and improvisations on his own fiddle. We are so choked by the old arts. We need to improvise, but in the opposite of jazz. Watch Taylor again in fancy, running for governor against his brother, in that famous good-humored campaign, with the Democrats under Bob, using the white rose of York as their emblem, and the Republicans, under Alfred, the red rose of Lancaster, the boys fiddling on the big pine platform draped with flags and bunting. Think of the days when red or white roses were worn by every soul of Tennessee. Those were the days of improvisation. So this is likewise, of all my productions, the one least intended for cold print. I urge all my friends to amend it as they read it. It is only in this way one can get much out of Bob Taylor's most famous orationâthe basis of this poem:âTaylor's own reminiscent âlecture,â âThe Fiddle and the Bow,â delivered from every Chautauqua platform in the United States and printed in his collected works: âThe Lectures and Best Literary Productions of Bob Taylor,â The Boy Taylor Publishing Co., Nashville, Tenn. âPracticalâ people hated Orpheus, Homer, Milton. Taylor is the livest and greatest new legend in America. As to his charms for âpracticalâ people, I have no doubt some of them foam as they read this. How bankers do hate a poet in office! As to Taylor's actual appearance, mannerisms and quality, I refer you to Taylor's book, the very adequate pictures therein, and several charming school histories of Tennessee, where the tale is told as marvelously as one in any Gilbert and Sullivan libretto. But to this is added an inventive and epic earnestness that is a tremendous sane prophecy for American domestic art and religion and power. Ask the Chautauqua man who met him in his very last days, when he became a national figure in that fashion, and any veteran senator, who met him in Washington, when he became a national figure in that fashion (presumably the supreme fashion). The element hardest to record is the village apocalypse quality, this inventive, epic earnestness. Some of us are beginning to see him the livest and greatest new prophet in America, an unconscious prophet, far closer to the future than Whitman, because actually elected to office again and again. Whitman was a thwarted Tammany brave. My friend Frank Waller Allen, of Los Angeles, a man of great Chatauqua experience, has talked to me about Taylor at great length, the last few years. And I remember one very pleasant evening with Bishop Gailor of Memphis, and the poet Will Percy, talking about Bob Taylor. This summer while visiting a charming Tennessee county seat, I carried the manuscript of this poem with me, and I heard much gossip of Taylor from fellow-politicians who helped him toward the governor's chair. The ideal aspects of a fiddling governor took stronger hold of me. They are now, frankly, the main theme of this song, the ideal aspects of the conception of a Fiddling Governor of a state of this Union. We certainly have had enough of utterly sordid âpracticalâ governors, of late. The more Frank Waller Allen tells me about Taylor, the more I feel that the Taylor ideal is a gigantic piece of democratic genius and initiative and, for that mere initiative, that costs so much in vitalityâthe everlasting glory of his state. Tennessee, and the Union, should, in the end, be held tranced by the ideal. It is as though Tennessee said to the world: âYou have business managers. But we have an Orpheus. Unless you also get the immortal soul of a musician, as a governor to rule you, we have put you everlastingly in the wrong. Your business-managers seem to be going to jail, fast.â As I read in a Tennessee school-history, a mere primer, the outline of the pretty story, I see the beautiful children of Tennessee huddled together, listening entranced, being made over into artists, poets, musicians, architects. Then I see all the children of America being made over into these, and into statesmen, prophets, saints and sibyls, tranced and listening to âMoney-Musk,â and looking up at a gigantic figure of Bob Taylor in a great blue rocking-chair in the sky. Now get the map of Tennessee, and look at the eastern counties. I was begging in East Tennessee, in the log-cabin region about which Taylor was always so eloquent, only a short journey from his ancestral mansion. I was between Flagpond and Greenville. I offered âThe Tree of Laughing Bellsâ pamphlet, in exchange for a night's lodging to a man on the porch of a log cabin, just the sort of cabin Taylor pictured in his orations. The man on the porch welcomed me that night in the name of Tennessee's Fiddling Governor. It was the first time I had heard of Taylor. But it was like coming to the edge of a new, tremendous, eternal tradition. This was about 1905. Taylor had been Governor 1887 to 1891 and 1897 to 1899. In that time he had made himself a part of the soul-fabric of the American people, like Johnny Appleseed and, andâRoosevelt and such diverse dreamers! Death and time were no more, and a day was as a thousand years, a thousand years as a day. I had come for eternity beneath the wing of Orpheus. It was there or near there I wrote the Canticle of the Tennessee Rose, which is in âA Handy Guide for Beggars,â page 109. The story of âLady Iron Heelsâ is an adventure in the same region. Bob Taylor is worth reading after. He could teach any man in the world, who would learn how to rule. Here is a quotation from his famous lecture, âThe Fiddle and Bowâ: âIt would be difficult for those reared amid the elegancies and refinements of life in city and town to appreciate the enjoyments of the gatherings and merrymakings of the great masses of the people who live in the rural districts of our country. The historian records the deeds of the great; he consigns to fame the favored few but leaves unwritten the âshort and simple annals of the poor,â the lives and actions of the millions. The modern millionaire, as he sweeps through our valleys and around our hills in his palace car, ought not to look with derision on the cabins of America, for from their thresholds have come more brains, and courage, and true greatness than ever emanated from all the palaces in this world. The fiddle, the rifle, the ax and the Bible, the palladium of American liberty, symbolizing music, prowess, labor, and free religion, the four grand forces of our civilization, were the trusty friends and faithful allies of our pioneer ancestry in subduing the wilderness and erecting the great commonwealths of the Republic. Wherever a son of freedom pushed his perilous way into the savage wilds and erected his log cabin, these were the cherished penates of his humble domicileâthe rifle in the rack above the door, the ax in the corner, the Bible on the table, and the fiddle, with its streamers of ribbon, hanging on the wall. Did he need the charm of music to cheer his heart, to scatter sunshine and drive away melancholy thoughts? He touched the responsive strings of his fiddle and it burst into laughter. Was he beset by skulking savages or prowling beasts of prey? He rushed to his deadly rifle for protection and relief. Had he the forest to fell and the fields to clear? His trusty ax was in his stalwart grasp. Did he need the consolation, the promises and precepts of religion to strengthen his faith, to brighten his hope and to anchor his soul to God and heaven? He held sweet communion with the dear old Bible. âThe glory and strength of the Republic to-day are its plain working people.â I like this better than Whitman's âSong of the Broad Axâ or âI Hear America Singing.â It is far nearer democracy, though much farther from the grand style. But it seems to me it will take only one more generation to lift the memory of lives like Taylor's into the real American art. It is nearer to the true beginning. Bob Taylor could teach any man in the world who would learn how to rule. He had no âBread and Circusesâ to bribe the crowd, after the manner of the Roman demagogues who purchased the votes of the Republic. But between fiddlings, on a thousand platforms, he told stories like this, to people who came a hundred miles afoot to hear him: THE CANDY-PULLING âThe sugar was boiling in the kettles, and while it boiled the boys and girls played âsnap,â and âeleven hand,â and âthimble,â and âblindfold,â and another old play which some of our older people will rememberâ âOh, Sister Phoebe, how merry were we When we sat under the juniper tree, The juniper tree Hi O.â âAnd when the sugar had boiled down into candy they emptied it into greased saucers, or, as the mountain folks called them, âgreased sassers,â and set it out to cool; and when it had cooled each boy and girl took a saucer and they pulled the taffy out and patted it and rolled it till it hung well together, and then they pulled it out a foot long; they pulled it out a yard long, and they doubled it back, and pulled it out, and looped it over, and pulled it out, and when it began to look like gold the sweethearts paired off and consolidated their taffy and pulled against each other. They pulled it out, and doubled it back, and looped it over, and pulled it out; and sometimes a peachblow cheek touched a bronzed one and sometimes a sweet little voice spluttered out, âYou, Jack,â and there was a suspicious smack like a cow pulling her foot out of stiff mud. They pulled the candy and laughed and frolicked; the girls got taffy on their hair, the boys got taffy on their chins, the girls got taffy on their waists, the boys got taffy on their coat sleeves. They pulled it till it was as bright as a moonbeam and then they plaited it and coiled it into fantastic shapes and set it out in the crisp air to cool. Then the courting began in earnest. They did not court then as the young folks court now. The young man led his sweetheart back into a dark corner and sat down by her, and held her hand for an hour and never said a word. But it resulted next year in more cabins on the hillsides and in the hollows, and in the years that followed the cabins were full of candy-haired children who grew up into a race of the best, the bravest, and the noblest people the sun in heaven ever shone upon. âIn the bright, bright hereafter, when all the joys of all the ages are gathered up and condensed into globules of transcendent ecstasy, I doubt whether there will be anything half so sweet as were the candy-smeared, ruby lips of the country maidens to the jeans-jacketed swains who tasted them at the candy-pulling in the happy long ago.â This was finally crystallized in his formal lecture, âThe Fiddle and Bow,â into the above form, but not until told a thousand ways a thousand times to a thousand stump-speech audiences. To tell such stories well is one of what Mr. Gilbert Sedles calls âThe Seven Lively Arts.â Bob Taylor could teach any man in the world who would learn how to rule. This âword-painting,â just below, was doubtless the final climax of many a stump-speech, and amid the dancing, the devilled eggs and fried chicken, was an outdoor tribute to the abstract qualities of the most abstract art. MUSIC âThe spirit of music, like an archangel, presides over mankind and the visible creation. Her afflatus, divinely sweet, divinely powerful, is breathed on every human heart, and inspires every soul to some nobler sentiment, some higher thought, some greater action. âO music! Sweetest, sublimest ideal of omniscienceâ first-born of Godâfairest and loftiest seraph of the celestial hierarchy, muse of the beautifulâdaughter of the Universe! âIn the morning of eternity, when the stars were young, her first grand oratorio burst upon raptured Deity and thrilled the wondering angels. All heaven shouted. Ten thousand times ten thousand jeweled harps, ten thousand times ten thousand angel tongues caught up the song, and ever since, through all the golden cycles, its breathing melodies, old as eternity yet ever new as the flitting hours, have floated on the air of heaven, lingering like the incense of its flowers on plumed hill and shining vale, empurpled in the shadow of the eternal throne. âThe seraph stood with outstretched wings on the horizon of heaven clothed in light, ablaze with gems and, with voice attuned, swept her burning harpstrings, and lo, the blue infinite thrilled with her sweetest note. The trembling stars heard it and flashed their joy from every flaming center. The wheeling orbs that course the crystal paths of space were vibrant with the strain and pealed it back into the glad ear of God. The far-off milky way, bright gulf stream of astral glories, spanning the ethereal deep, resounded with its harmonies, and the star-dust isles, floating in that river of opal, reÃ«choed the happy chorus from every sparking strand.â This is what the old Southern orators used to call âsky-painting oratory.â It is indeed that, we confess, and deny it not. Read indoors, this quotation is a bit flowery. But, of course, every one hundred per cent American believes in democracy. Let the reader take it to a county fair, mount the nearest box, wave his hand and read it in competition with every Cracker-Jack seller on the place. Or just read it to himself in that setting. He will suddenly discover it taking on great dignity and proportions. I have tried to write my tribute to Bob Taylor in the spirit of these three quotations. Try the above quotation in front of the grand stand, between horse races, or imagine yourself doing so. Then try my own piece of âsky-painting oratoryâ given below. I have tried to add a bit more of the pioneer Tennessee County Fair point of view. The third quotation above moves in the other direction. It is a great democratic way of saying that art has some mysterious abstract occult qualities. It is the outdoor or âlog-cabinâ way of reiterating the dogmas of Walter Pater. I have tried to consider its meaning. In his school of âThe Fiddle and Bow,â He could teach every man in the world, Who would learn how to rule. His was no gladiatorial show, By tears and kindness he ruled his democracy, With never a wall flower, never an enemy. With one bold fiddle, with a heart never cool, Loving them all, serving them all, Playing old tunes that conquered them all, He brought his whole state to one violin school, He brought his whole marvelling crowd To one beautiful school. On his birthday, he teaches his state to flower! Unabashed orator, dropping his pearls! To-day, he is shaking the butterflies' thrones! Orpheus stirs up the squirrels to be barking; Bee-hives are ringing their phones, Wasps their razors are honing. Good wheat ripens, and whistles and drones, Cotton fields fiddle a tune to the sun, Cornstalks rustle tassels and ears, Spiders whirl round with misgivings and fears. Bob Taylor is teaching his crowd to flower, Shaking the butterflies' thrones! There are pinch-faced people that snarl and deride, For a singer trimphant defiles their pride. Where are the hearts born to power, My darlings, Where are the hearts born to power? You boys and girls With the frolicsome manner, From the first and second and third and fourth reader! Will you lift your conquering Tennessee banner? Oh, children, born of McGuffey's old reader, With your new little brothers and sisters, Will you heed the prophecies, Mellow and rare, Of the governing fiddle of Governor Taylor, As he rocks in his blue rocking-chair, As he rocks in his blue rocking-chair? Oh, his giant chair of sky and dreams Of the Great Smoky Mountains and East County Streams, Tennessee clover and Tennessee rain, Mixed with natural laughter and pain, While Taylor's birthday comes 'round, comes 'round, As he rocks in his blue rocking-chair, my darlings, As he rocks in his blue rocking-chair! As he lends a new splendor to log-cabin hearthstones, Till the oceans reÃ«cho his violin tones, Oh, where are the hearts born to power, My darlings, Oh, where are the hearts born to power? Who has the wings of the eagle? Who has the wings of the lark? Who has the wings of the owlet As he dives through the twilight and dark? Who will fly in dance time, in the springtime, To the Money-Musk of Governor Bob, As he shouts the new war cry of spring at its height, And his fiddle gives forth a sweet sob? As he sits on a cloud in the moonlight, As he shakes up the world and its bones, As he shakes up the nations that lie in their ashes, And his bow sweeps the stars and the zones, my darlings, And his bow sweeps the poles and the zones? There are pinch-faced people that snarl and deride, For a singer triumphant defiles their pride. But now let us go to each county seat, Where the old county fairs make the harvest complete, And friend meets friend with pride. In the merry-go-round where we will ride To the music of the far stars' hum, And the music of the hearth-crickets' drum, And the tunes of Governor Bob, that will never end, In the merry-go-round that we will make, Many queer things we will undertake, While the children will break ambrosial cake, Bears will bring us honey-bread, And the turkeys bring us honey-bread. In the merry-go-round that we will make, The cricket will chirp, the bee will hum, The cricket will chirp, the bee will hum, While the spokes of the merry-go-round go round. A world-wide merry-go-round we will make, With a tall elm tree for the central stake, (While the spokes of the merry-go-round go round!) The lark will cry the world awake, The lark will cry the world awake. Kind hearts will cry the world awake. And now let us tell just the same child storyâ In other terms, and with other glory. While to-day's young children group around us, clap their pudgy hands, And tell each other tales of beasts of distant lands, And tell each other stories of sheiks and desert sands, While they rock in big Grand Rapids chairs, varnished hard and slick, Let flames of his birthday fiddle, coming nearer, make them quiver, Let flames of the Governor's fiddle Light each spirit's candlewick. Let there be repeated visions Of this man in every cabin, The statesman, the soul's visitor, the mystical vote getter. Now, just before Taylor finds âyou and me, Behold a young fairy called Tennessee,â Come to set souls free. She stands on the nation's hearthstones, In the homes of millions, debatingâ And there for the presence of Taylor waiting, And chattering there with our tiniest children As they watch for our man at the window sills, Stories of hunters and trappers relating, Martha Washington parties, and Jackson quadrilles. She is crowned with three burning Tennessee stars, Her soul is Jackson and Taylor and Boone, The white far-flaming soul of the West, For Tennessee once was the world's Wild West, And is still, in secret, the world's Wild West. With the eyes of the dawn and the gesture of pride, And a fairy's heart in her childish side, A heart for magicâa heart for music, A heart that will not be denied. Now Taylor's birthday comes 'round, comes 'round. He is rocking now, and swaying, and playing, In this, the millennial hour. And his fiddle, speaking with tongues, keeps saying, âBehold, the young beauty, called: âTennessee.ââ Obeying the fiddler's merry command, Tennessee, In the shining form of a child, Holds out her white hand. Then a village Apocalypse indeed! Taylor's news films of the future, His merry Orphic games for his every dreaming creature, Set to the Dixie tunes of âKingdom Come,â Tunes for stubborn souls, No longer blind or dumb. Threads of incense, Then log cabins come, Then Red Indian council halls, Toys of the past, Tossed up through the sky's blue walls, And then, From the white palm there, Those toys, and those threads of smoke, become the world's World's Fair, That floats, to merry robin notes, And goes up, in shining power and authority and worth, Till there a university of man's whole soul has birth, From old McGuffey's reader style, From toy-shop style, and play-room style, and baby Christmas mirth, Spreading in terrible splendor, conquering the sad earth, Spreading out like a Maytime field, Coming down like an angel's misty shield, A fair of the secret spirit, of the proud heart's comforter! From the fairy comes a cry: From the strange child comes a cry: âOur pride is eternal, a tree no worm can killâ It is older than the old oak trees, deathless like the sky.â And we go with the dream World's Fair, We walk on its strange wide streetsâ And the nation is the child and the child is the nation, With pride in noble toysâ With the same firm, quick heartbeatsâ Old toys grown great, now built anewâ Hilltop sunrise battlements set against the blueâ Set in cloudy streets of giant blue-ridge pines, Where every kind of dewy flower vine shines. And yet some childish towers have great pink ribbon bows, And big bisque dolls, And Indian dolls Hold up some mighty roofs in pillared rows. And jewelled city flags wave high, And toy-shop mayors bow the knee To those flags, unstained and wildflower sweet, And the pouring crowds, set free. Yet the fiddle cries in majesty of our nation's good and ill, Great brains work greatly, with a will, And the trees of pride no worm can kill Grow stronger still. While some wireless from Aldeberan Rolls down from on highâ How democracy has swept the farthest starsâ Broken up Aldeberan's prison bars, And the shout shakes and thrills The nation's new-born, dream-born toy, The Tinselled Oak Tree, priest of Truth, And the new-born, dream-born toy, Tinselled Mulberry, priest of Youth, And the new-born, dream-born toy, The Amaranth-Apple Tree, White as the foam of the jasper-sea, Priest of the Holy Spirit's grace. And the new-born Golden-Rain-Tree, Tinselled priest, at our honeyed feast, Priest of the future Human race, On our soul-paths set with fantasy, Where the children of our hearthstones Find the proud toys of democracy, Find Majesty and Alchemy, While Orpheus plays his fiddle there. And look, there are Maypoles in a row, And baskets pouring out strange flowers For all the crowds that pass, And tiny fairy Maypoles And roller-skating rinks, For all the squealing infant class, In the nation that shall be, Beginning with this loverâ Of innocent small children, Beginning with this fiddler And his fairy Tennesseeâ On the borders of our prairies, Our Middle-Western sea. And our highest art will come in this Hereafter. And in all the parks so gay Sad young Shellys, learning laughter, Amid High-school yells, and college yells, and adventure yells, Weird Confederate yells, weird Union yells, In scandalous music, whispered, hissing, drumming, While above the skylark flying machines Of all man's future humming! Playthings of the fancies of young Shellys that shall be, And their little brothers and sisters, And the pouring crowds set free, By the conqueror of deathâ By the great Orpheus fiddler, and his fairy Tennessee. Oh, the pinch-faced people still think we are drunk, With this pearl-dropping orator's fair, With this sky-painting orator's fair. They call it âthe old Buncombe county bunk,â Deriding our village Apocalypse there, Our old Happy Valley fair, Turned to a world's World's Fair, Though there are the glories of all creation, Thoughts, from every ultimate nation, Though the birds and the beasts are thereâ Changed from the whimsies of first creation, To things majestic from Revelation:â Still, the pinch-faced people think we are drunk, Curse us, and think we are drunk. And now let us tell just the same child storyâ In other terms, and with other glory. Obeying the fiddler's command. Tennessee in the shining form of a child Holds out her white hand. From her magic palm, strange doll books come, Toys tossed up through the wide sky's walls, They turn to boys' âdime libraries,â They turn to girls' doll whimsies, Snark-hunting paper flimsies, They turn to children's Christmas books, Alice-in-Wonderland looking-glass books, And Pilgrim's Progress allegory books, Singing bolder words as their leaves spread more and more And up into the sky the flocks of beauty pourâ The flags of imagination on the page of the soul's sky, Each gorgeous new day's print goes by. And as the full years sweep along Each old man reads his patriarch tome, In the light of his dear hearth home, And each child follows his new toy book Though it flies across the world, For always it returns To his home-town hearthstone towers and bowers, And childhood's wildflower banners unfurled. So, each child keeps his soul alone, As he keeps his ballot still his own, True to the stars that gave him birthâ And the dreams he found in the wide earthâ To the Orpheus, to the fiddler and his fairy Tennessee, And the pouring crowds, set free. The night rolls 'round, stars light the land. Obeying the fiddler's command, Tennessee in the shining form of a child Holds out her white hand. And now let us tell just the same child story, In other terms, and with other glory. Now, hear the cry of all the nations, Hear the cry of the generations, Egypt to Utopia, The hieroglyphic parallel written on the skyâ Following all the wayâ The cry of the sun by day, The cry of the stars by night, The cry of the deep, deep earth, The cry of the deep, deep earth. She holds out her white handâ From the incense, from the fairy palm, From the wild cry in the air White temples and pavilions there From Adam's day to Kingdom Come, Tossed up through the great sky's walls, Petals before a humming wind, And we watch them spread their delicate eaves Amid quivering leavesâ Altarsâthen cathedrals, Go up in long progression, Growing greater, Killing the gloom, Till we see the white procession All future forms of holy faith Stand still and take possession Of our nation that shall be, Tremendous white Cathedral ships, On our Middle-Western Sea, Whose waves are fields of cotton, corn and wheat, Orchard paths and boulevards And pouring crowds, set free, By the Orpheus, the fiddler, the conqueror of Death, And his fairy, Tennessee. And now let us tell just the same child story, In other terms, and with other glory. Oh, where are the child souls, With the singers' pride, Who will wake, refusing defeat and death, Returning perpetually from the grave, Generation on generation? Where are the furious wills of the nation? Oh, where are the hearts born to power? âOh, who is there among us, the true and the tried, Who will stand by his colors, who is on the Lord's side?â Who will rise each century, shout once again, Who will wake in hot faith With our cavalcade ride? Send up their American souls from the grave, And go forth in glory, aspiring, Breathing springtime breath and noonday fire, Armed with doll beauty perilous, Armed with child glory marvellous, Armed with Southern poems delirious, Armed with grass daggers They found in the ground, Armed with old shields they dug up in the sky, By the Archangel Mountains highâ Armed with long swords like the young crescent moonâ Oh, who is there among us, the true and the tried, Who will ride against Death and his endless cruelty, However his legions conspire? Who will ride against all grown-up foes of Democracy? âTo-morrow, to-morrow,â their marvelous tuneâ âTo-morrow,â their marvelous cry of desireâ Going forth with pouring armies Of the deathless young and gay, Driving Death forever from the way. Yes, who will sing in the follies of Heaven To the Taylor-born Tennessee tune? Who will follow the child Tennessee Armed with soul-swords like the young crescent moon? Who will follow her through the twilight, Or in the morning, by the bright light, Armed by her music, shouting her fame, As she rides down the future with her boys all white flame, As she rides down the future with her girls all white fire? Just in time to stop the charges Of Death and all his hosts That turn at last to beaten ghost. As she shouts down a thousand long years, my darlings, Magic to-morrow the best of her tune, Magic to-morrow her cry of desire. ... Her troops dressed in white for the spirits' delight, She will stand in her stirrups a Torch of White Light, The fairy child, Tennessee, The soul of us, hope of us, helper and tyrant, On her Pegasus horse of thunder and snow, 'Round the merry-go-round she will go. We dream we will make a merry-go-round, While Taylor's birthday comes 'round, comes 'round, A beautiful toy while the daisies laughâ A picnic place for Taylor's sake And his lovers, and little brothers and sisters. ... We dream we will build a merry-go-round. Whose root is a flame in the ancient ground, Whose flagpole is a tree to the sky, A merry-go-round ten centuries high. In the merry-go-round that we will makeâ Of these Dixie thoughts of Kingdom Come, In the merry-go-round that we will makeâ The cricket will chirp, the bee will hum, The cricket will chirp, the bee will hum, The lark will cry the world awake, Governor Taylor will govern the song, Ten centuries will sweep alongâ And the prairies and mountains will whirl around, The prairies will whirl around, around. In the merry-go-round that we will makeâ The lark will cry the world awake, Kind hearts will cry the world awake. Toys will be men, dolls will be men, And our sages and saints good dolls again. Each painted reindeer will be a chum. Not a single dingo or dog will be dumb. And the horses will not be horses of wood, Nor iron nor ivory, nor jewel nor jade, Not hobby-horses whose paint will fade, But Pegasus ponies on parade, But Pegasus ponies on parade, Whose hoofs are of ice, and whose wings are of fire. White horses of Hope and the Spirit's desire, White horses of Hope and the Spirit's desireâ On our horses of fire and thunder and snow 'Round the merry-go-round we will go, 'Round the merry-go-round we will go. A SONG FOR ELIZABETH (Set to music by Albert V. Davies. Sung by Carolina Lazzari) On the top of my red banner Is a Psyche-Butterfly, And I am very proud, And would lift my banner high, And march, perhaps, to somewhere, Or on to splendid nowhere, Or on to anywhere, And tell this hour good-by, And I am in a fidget To hurry up and get there. But I must be quite still Or I will spoil my day. I do not want my heart to die, I do not want my soul to die, I do not want that butterfly To scare and fly away. THE FLYING HOUSE, AND THE MAY QUEEN ETERNAL Queen Venus, come now, be my heroine, To form my pictures, and to scan my song, And dominate that tall, enchanted house, Invisible house, where I have lived so long. Fast-flying house, that crosses sea and land. House, always mine and empty but for me. Fly near me, so your shadow may be near And fall across my doors, and comfort me. That house, all lights and shadows and no walls, Has, for its doors and windows, barriers proud, Closed wings for doors, or open wings for doors, And, for its windows, wind-harps, singing loud. Even your wing-whirr is a comfort there, Your wireless whisper heard, though far away, Makes you the heroine in that tall house. The romance stays, if such fine honors stay. Here I will live on shadows, if I must, Kissing one shadow's soft eyes to the end. I will write out and draw new wind-harp rhymes, Sons of your shadow's flesh and blood, dear friend. (First contributed to Christopher Morley's Column in the New York Evening Post, âThe Bowling Green,â then reproduced in his book, âThe Bowling Green.â BILLBOARDS AND GALLEONS (Inscribed to Stephen Graham) I Each day is Biloxi's birthday party, This whole poem is to be read aloud, with great speed, and in one breath, as it were, as though it were one word, rather than one sentence. This, over and over, till the metrical scheme is fluid in the mind, a unit. Then, of course, read very slowly. Splendid with many a sun-kissed wonder, Splendid with many a swimming girl. Oh, there is melted the heart of stone, Fantasy, rhyme, and rhapsody ring. From street car and Ford and yellow taxi, Argosies crowded to shrieking capacityâ With moon-struck boy and sun-struck girl. Tourists, residents, what you pleaseâ From the whirling south, from the whirling north, Bees near the hive, Or far from home, Dreaming of love like honeycomb. âBarney Googleâ is what they sing, âMister Shean and Mister Gallagher,â âBlack Joe,â and âOld Kentucky Home,â âSwing Low Sweet Chariot,â âMaryland,â âDixie,â âSometimes I feel like a Mourning Dove,â âThe Pullman Porters on Parade,â Or hear, now, my âSong of Love.â But storms come down from the soul of the Universe, Put the long coast in imminent jeopardy, Despoiling felicity, quenching the ecstasy, Hide my fantastical town from meâ Where every street is a valentine, The kind we gave to love in youth Where the lace is deep, three layers deep, In, and in, and in you look:â Gossamer book! Fairy book! Once, when such a storm was on, When every spiritual hope seemed gone, I was burning the world like a bridge, behind me, I was walking in water so no one could find meâ In the edge of the waves, where the waves meet the beachâ Forest and sea waves, both within reach, Far from my prairie home, Far from the old hive, far from home, Dreaming of love like honeycomb. Twisted winds, coming down, from Heaven knows where, Blistered feet were mine, seaweed was my hair. Dream sea birds flew down on fanatical wings, Flew down through tremendous red-rainbow rimmed rings. They were speaking of glory, speaking of death, Were shrieking creepy, fanatical things. Many unwritten songs of mine, long forgotten, And dim resolves, and loves forgotten Swept in with the driftwood and foamy flakes. Yet I said: âI will march till glory wakes, Yet I said: âMy brain with marvelling sings That courage and sleep, courage and sleep are the principal things,â March on, sleep-walkers, till courage comes With invisible drums, March, while the sad heart breaks, Whirl on, like a leaf, then fight againâ Sleep and courage! Sleep and courage! The fate of men! It was there, on the proud Spanish Trail I was walking, And I thought of Don Ivan, my Spanish ancestor, Friend of Columbus, and Isabel's guest, From the stormy right Come the green sea talking; I was walking the Old Spanish Trail toward Biloxi, So famous for legends of Spanish chivalry! City of feathers, balloons and confetti, City of hearties, of birthday parties! Oh, streets of valentines in long lines, Great garden of mocking-bird melody, Oh, filagree city of fogs and mystery! Far from the old hive, far from my home, I was dreaming of love like honeycomb. And startling pathways, starry-white, Were revealed by the lightning and street light, Revealed, Revealed by the lightning and street light. II Buzzing autos, like black bees, Like black bees, Hurried through the magnolia trees, Then billboards, to make nations store, Come in the vision flashy and vain, Washed by the midnight sea-born rain, Washed by the midnight sea-born rain. They went like cliffs up to the sky, America's glories flaming high, Festooned cartoons, an amazing mixture, Shabby, shoddy, perverse and twistical, Shamefully boastful, Shyly mystical. Politics, with all its tricks, both old parties in a fix! Donkey and elephant short of breath. La Follette scorning them half to death. The snappy Saturday Evening Post Displaying, and advertising most The noisiest things from coast to coast. Exaggerated Sunday papers, Comic sheets like scrambled eggs, And Andy Gump's first-reader capers, All on those billboards to the sky. Who put them there, in the way, and why? Pictured skyscrapers of the night, Marble-topped, tremendous, white! There were Arrow-collar heroes proud, Holding their heads above the crowd, Looking for love like honeycomb. There was many an ice-cream vendor, There were business kings in a daisy chain, Then movie queens in a daisy chain, Sugar-faced, unlaced and slender, dreaming of love like honeycomb. Then all the rascals of the land, All the damned for the last ten years, Rising from their doom with tears, Skeletons, skeletons, leather and bone, Each dead soul chained to a saxaphoneâ Watching the roaring storm above, Looking for honey-dreams and love. All on those billboards to the sky, Who put them there, in the way, and why? Then a railroad map of the U. S. A. Then a soul-road map of the U. S. A. Showing all the flowers of the land, But nowhere, love like honeycomb. Only signboards, only billboards, Washed by the midnight sea-born rain, Washed by the midnight sea-born rain. III There were open boxes of fine cigars, As big and bold as Pullman cars. And on the brass-bound lids of these Old Spain was pictured as you please. And, Here's the night's miracle began, The greatest splendor known to man. Flourishing masks and cigarettes, Clicking their ribboned castanets, Were Gypsies in high back combs and shawls, Strutting through the Alhambra's halls. Why were these billboards to the skyâ Who put them there, in the way, and why? First I thought all the splendor had goneâ I was in darknessâI was in darknessâplunging on. On the left were summer resort and lawn. The flash of the trolley car, The flash of the midnight train. On the rightâlittle waves, then great waves, Then masts and shafts, then the wrecks of raftsâ Pirate ships of the Spanish main, Then the wrecks of the Galleons of Spain. Red coins, then jewels, Drowned parrots, drowned peacocks, Then a tolling sound, a tolling sound, Then the wrecks of the Galleons of Spain, Rolling by, rolling on, in the rain! Rolling by, rolling on, in the foam! Love calls, death cries; Drowned pirates, drowned Spanish beautiesâ Drowned Incas, then drowned Montezumas; First friars of Quetzal, then nuns of Quetzal, Lost faces, sweet as the honeycomb. First friars of Christendom, then nuns of Christendom, Lost faces, sweet as the honeycomb. Then a tolling sound, a tolling soundâ Pirate ships of the Spanish Main, Then the wrecks of the Galleons of Spain Rolling by, rolling on, in the rain, Rolling by, rolling on, in the foam. And I said: âI will march till my soul re-awakes.â And I said: âMy mind with marvelling sings, That âcourage and sleep, courage and sleep, are the principal things,ââ For there came dead eagles, then dead panthers, Then, millions of men to the edge of the sky:â Dead Spanish Legions, from the deep-sea regionsâ While increasing rain whipped the sea and the air. Then there came a noise like a vulture crying. Then there came a cheering, cheering soundâ Bullrings slowly whirling around, Bullrings, bullrings, 'round and 'round, Bullrings, bullrings, 'round and 'round. Then waves like ponies, waves like bulls, Then waves like Seminoles, waves like Negroes, Dragging up their chains from the deep, Singing of love like honeycomb. Then waves like tobacco fields, waves like cornfields, Waves like wheat fields, turning to battlefields. Then Round-table crusaders, then world-paraders, Tall kings in shining silver line, As though for a miracle and a sign, Singing songs like Spanish wine. Then I saw the bad Pizzaro, Then hours of dewy jungle-glowâ Dim Peru and Mexico. Then the wild seeker, Coronado, singing of love like honeycomb, With all his furious train, foaming by in the rain, Singing in eternal sleep, lifted, singing from the deep. Then the tall town of Eldorado, Passing by, like a fog and a shadow. And then I saw a girl more pale Than any fairy ever shoneâ A white light in the southern night, As cold as the north Auroral light Reigning over the sea alone! My heart was like a burning world, I saw it flame above the dawn, Her robe, her footstool and her throne! And she was like a moon and pearl, And like an Alabaster stone! So far away in the utmost sky! Her beauty like the honeycomb, The secret love, Glory and Fateâ Her wings from the earth to Heaven's gate, A pillar in the dawn apart. Then she was goneâthe dawn was goneâ Black storm! Black storm! And I plunged on. Then lightning bolts across the sky, Then a great bubble like a dome, In whirling, whirling, whirling splendor. Then Sancho Panza! Then Don Quixote, He who could not know surrender, Glory's ultimate contender, Singing in eternal sleep, Lifted, singing from the deep, Singing of love like honeycomb! Thenâ Windmills, windmills, 'round and 'round, Windmills, windmills, 'round and 'round, Windmills, windmills, 'round and 'round! Then a great storm, a fearful cry, a bell of doomâ A tolling sound, a tolling sound, a tolling sound. Then the wrecks of the Galleons of Spainâ Rolling by, rolling on, in the rain, Rolling by, rolling on, in the foam. By these ships, on the right, were the red waves cleft, Then, again on the left, stood the billboards there, Queerly fine to the zenith line, Overhead to the zenith lineâ Washed by the midnight sea-born rain, Washed by the midnight sea-born rain, Gleaming down, as the wrecks went by. Looking at fair, lost Spain! Between these visions I plunged on, And straight ahead came to the wonder of dawn, In that foggy dawn, storm-washed Biloxi! The piers were wrecks, street cars were wrecks, Sidewalks were wrecks. Yet straight ahead arose from the dead, The valentine, filagree towers of mystery, The snow-white skyscrapers of new history. Oh, fantasy, sugar and mockery! Oh, mocking birds in their whimsy! Oh, pretty, lazy Biloxi, City haughty and fair, knowing not why:â And looking high at the mast-filled sky, Looking up at the ghost-filled sky, Looking at fair, lost Spain. HOW DULCENIA DEL TOBOSO IS LIKE THE LEFT WING OF A BIRD My child is like a bird's wing, a bird's wing, a bird's wing. Slender like a bird's wing, curving like a bird's wing. Her bones like those that leap and fling, And make the quick bird's wing, An elegant And slender Fairy-fashionplate design, Plumed like a bird's wing, steel strong, but very tender, Every curve of life to render. And her motion, like a bird's wing, cutting higher, She spreads above my sky, A noble, an immortal thing, A phÅnix-wing of fire. She spreads above my sky An aurora and a sign, An elegant and slender fairy-fashionplate design. And then we are timid, And infinitely small, Two children playing house In a pine tree tall. Or she is then a wren's wing Hiding a small-boy wren, Or I am hidden like a hope, tied with a cob-web rope, Beneath a humming bird's wing, a bird's wing, a bird's wing, And then she is an eagle's wing, a hawk's wing, a Greek god's wing, Teaching me, her son, to fly where tremendous stars sing. But I have never gone through clouds that hide her everywhere, Have only seen one wing emerge from fog or sea or cloudy air, Her eyes, Like the fixed eyes On the butterfly's or pheasant's wing. I have never seen her young soul's face, Her hidden eyes, and the other wing, I have never heard the word of grace My hawk will cry, my swallow sing. I have only seen the left wing, One fair, emerging bird's wing. My child is like a bird's wing, a bird's wing, a bird's wing, A dreamy wing, a lone wing. THE PEARL OF BILOXI Proudest pearl of the wide world, Haughtier than an Inca's plume, You and I, near this Biloxi, Long were laid in a shell tomb. There we slept like white blind kittens Curled in a warm kitchen box, While the friendly fist of the sea On our roof made humorous knocks Without breaking the shell box. Grandest pearl of the whole world, And so vain you are twice dear, Kin to dragon flies and dragons, Kin to larks and kin to larkspurs, Kin to gold and white snapdragons And hot bees that drink such flagons You grew whiter year by year, You grew slender, like a dawn ray To the plume, and flower, and torch I find you here. Plume, upon the sunrise crest, Pride of the beach, and set apart, Hearing me, if not concurringâ Do we not have one horizon? Is there not a secret stirring, Yes, a deep-sea-kitten purring, Then the slow thump of the ocean, Deep in your heart, and my heart? Oh, your heart is sky and ocean! Each fond heart a world-wide heart ... To a new religion set apart ... Set apart, Set apart. DOCTOR MOHAWK (Inscribed to Ridley Wills) (A most informal chant, being a rhymed commentary on the preface, âAdventures While Singing These Songs,â pages 8 and 14, especially the reference to the Red Indian ancestor. To this to be added a tradition that one branch of my mother's family came of the Don Ivans, of Spain.) I Being a Seven-Year-Old Boy's Elaborate Memory of the Day of His Birth In through the window a sea-mustang brought me, The poem to be read with the greatest possible speed, imitating the galloping of a sea-mustang, each time faster till it is so memorized, all the reptends musically blended, almost as though the poem were one long word, then of course, read very slowly. (Smashing the window sash, breaking the law). I was tied to his backâI do not know who caught me. Up from Biloxi, up the great Mississippi, Through the swamps, through the thaw, through the rains that grew raw, On the tenth of November (the hail storm was nippy). Up the slow, muddy Sangamon Riverâ (While we heard the towns cough and we heard the farms shiver), The high wave rolled on. We heard a crow squawk, With a voice like a buzz saw, destroying the day: âCaw, caw, you are rolling to meet the tall Mohawk, He will burn you to ashes and turn you to clay, You will burn like a scarecrow with fire in the straw, You are rolling and whirling on to the Mohawk, Caw, caw, Caw, caw.â We sighted and broke the high hedge of Oak Ridge, We rolled through its tombs. We saw Incubi walk. We leaped the snow mounds like a pack of bloodhounds. Dead lawyers were shrieking: âYou are breaking the law.â We spoiled and howled down the shrill cemetery sounds, Swept townward: a green wave, a foam wave, a moon wave, Up the dawn streets of Springfield, high tide in a cave, Up to Edwards and Fifth street, and broke every windowpane. They thought we were âcyclone,â earthquake, and rain. We smashed the front door. We ramped by the bed's head. On the wall-paper pattern sea-roses bloomed red. There, for a ceiling bent crab-thorn, hazel-brush, Red-haw, black-haw, (And the storm blew a horn,) There fluttered a carrion crow that cried: âCaw!â A scare-crow so queer, and a crow that cried: âCaw, Caw! Caw!â II Being my notion, as a Ferocious Small-Boy, of my Ancestral Protector. The porpoise was grandma. The Mohawk was doctor: âHeap-big-chief-the-Mohawk,â with eye like a tommyhawk: Naked, in war-paint, tough stock and old stock, Furious swash-buckler, street-brawler, world-breaker, Plumed like an Indian, an American dragon, Tall as Sun-mountain, long as the Sangamon, With a buffalo beard, all beast, yet all human, Sire of the Mexican king, Montezuma, Of Quetzal the Fair God, and prince Guatomozin, And that fated Peruvian, Atahualpa, Of King Powhatan and his brown Pocahontas, And of everything Indian serious or humorous, Sire of the âMohocksâ who swept through old London, (Too dirty for Swift and too wicked for Addison;) He was carver of all the old Indian cigar-signs, Chief of all the wild Kickapoo doctors, And their log-cabin remedies known to our fathers, Sire of St. Tammany, and sweet Hiawatha, Tippecanoe, and Tyler Too, He was named Joseph Smith, he was named Brigham Young, He was named Susquehannah, he was named Mississippi, Every river and State in the Indian Tongue, Every park, every town that is still to be sung:â Yosemite, Cheyenne, Niagara, Chicago! The Pride of the U. S. A.:âthat is the Mohawk, The Blood of the U. S. A.:âthat is the Mohawk, He is tall as Sun-Mountain, long as the Sangamon, Proud as Chicago, a dream like Chicago, And I saw the wild Star-Spangled Banner unfurl Above the tall Mohawk that no man can tame Old son of the sun-fire, by many a name. When nine, I would sing this yarn of the sea, With ample embroidery I now must restrain (Giving the facts and omitting the flowers) It proved new fantastics were coming to me. The Mohawk! the Mohawk! the Mohawk! the Mohawk! Doctor and midwife! ancestral protector! Breathed Mohawk fire through me, gave long claws to me, Told my father and mother they must soon set me free, Told the dears I had lived with a pearl in the billow In the Mexican Gulf, in the depths of that sea, For infinite years. Put the pearl by my pillow. (It was new as that hour, and as old as the sea)â The Soul of the U. S. A.âthat was the pearl. It became a white eagle I could not understand. And I saw the carrion crow fly away. And I saw the boughs open and the sun of that day, And I saw the white eagle in the clouds fly and whirl Then soar to the skies to a Star-Spangled Land. And I cried, and held hard to my mother's warm hand. And the Mohawk said:ââRed man, your first trial begins.â And the Mohawk roared:ââShame to you, coward and mourner!â And the Great Chief was gone. But my life was all planned. I wept with my mother. I kissed and caressed her. Then she taught me to sing. Then she taught me to play:â The sibyl, the strange one, the white witch of May. Creating diversion with slow-talk and long-talk, She sang with girl-pride of her Spanish ancestor, The mighty Don Ivan, Quixotic explorer:â Friend of Columbus, Queen Isabel's friend, Conquistador! Great-great-great-grandfather. I would cry and pressed close to her, all through the story For the Mohawk was gone. And gone was my glory:â Though that white-witch adored me, and fingered each curl, Though I saw the wild Star-Spangled Banner unfurl, Though a Spanish Ancestor makes excellent talk. I was a baby, with nothing to say But:ââThe Mohawk, the Mohawk, the Mohawk, the Mohawk.â And I knew for my pearl I must hunt this long way Through deserts and dooms, and on till to-day. I must see Time, the wild-cat, gorging his maw, I must hear the death-cry of the deer he brought low, And the cry of the blood on his pantherish paw, And that carrion crow on his shoulder cry âCaw, Caw! Caw!â III One Brief Hour of Grown-up Glory on the Gulf of Mexico. Far from the age of my Spanish ancestor, Don Ivan the dreamer, Friend of Columbus, and Isabel's friend, Wherever I wander, beggar or guest, The soul of the U. S. A.:âthat is my life-quest. Still I see the wild Star-Spangled Banner unfurl. And at last near Biloxi, in glory and sport I met Doctor Mohawk, while swimming this morning Straight into the Gulf of Mexico Sun. The Mohawk! the Mohawk! the Mohawk! the Mohawk! From the half-risen sun, in the pathway of blood Sea-roses swept round me, red-kissed of the flood. And the flying fish whispered: âthe First Trial is done.â Magnificent mischief now was a-borning. First: I dived and brought up the cool dream called âThe Pearl.â As far from the Mohawk as peace is from murder, As far from the Mohawk as May from November, As far from the Mohawk as love is from scorning, As far from the Mohawk as snow is from fire. Yet, the Mohawk arm lifted me out of that flood (The blood of the U. S. A.âthat is the Mohawk) And he healed my sick heart where the thunder-winds hurl, There in the fog, at the top of the sun Cool were his foam-fins, majestic his graces, Doctor, and glorious Ancestral Protector, Exhorter, reprover, corrector. Then we swam to the sky through crystalline spaces, The clouds closed behind us, all the long way, And a rainbow-storm priesthood that hour blessed the bay, Medicine men, in tremendous array, While he spoke to me kindly and yet with fine scorning For hunting for favors with rabbits or men. Breathed Mohawk fire through me, gave long claws to me And told me to think of my birthday again:â How the sun is a Mohawk, and our best ancestor: I must run to him, climb to him, swim to him, fly to him, And laugh like a sea-horse, or life will grow dim. How only the Mohawks will call me their brother, (We will flourish forever, breaking the law) They are laughing through all of the lands and the oceans, (And only great worlds make an Indian laugh) They are singing and swimming their pranks and their notions With poems, and splendid majestical motions, And they will stand by me, and save and deliver, With the pearl near my heart, they will love me forever, An eagle, a girl, then a moon on the sand, The bird of the U. S. A.âthat is the darlingâ Whirling and dancing, swimming with awe In the light of the sun, in the infinite shining Of the uncaptured future:âthat is the darling. The infinite future, that is the eagle,â An eagle, a moon, a girl on the sand, The Soul of the U. S. A.âthat is the pearl, Without flaw.

SECTION XI A SONG BASED ON EGYPTIAN HIEROGLYPHICS: THE TRIAL OF THE DEAD CLEOPATRA IN HER BEAUTIFUL AND WONDERFUL TOMB The trial opens B.C. 29. This is the date of the death of CÃ¦sarion, shortly after the suicide of Cleopatra. CÃ¦sarion, natural heir to the empires of Egypt and Rome, son of Cleopatra and Julius CÃ¦sar, was assassinated by his cousin Octavian. This made Octavian Augustus CÃ¦sar sole heir of Julius CÃ¦sar, made him ruler of the known world. (Inscribed To Elizabeth Mann Wills) I. She Becomes a Soul, Flowering Toward Egyptian Resurrection, B.C. 29 Said Set, the Great Accuser: âYou poisoned your young brothers.â But the mummy of Cleopatra whispered: âThese were the slanders of Rome.â âYou poisoned your faithful servants, you sold the Nile to CÃ¦sar.â But the mummy of Cleopatra whispered: âThese were the slanders of Rome.â âYou gambled with Marc Antony for the last wheat in Egypt, And for the last blood of Egypt.â But the mummy of Cleopatra whispered: âThese were the slanders of Rome.â And Set, the soul defiler, the hyena, the tomb-violator, Yet Prosecuting Attorney of gods and stars, Eternal in the eternal judgment room, Said: âAntony is again my witness Again to declare this woman vile.â For the ninth time Thoth drew him on the wall, Again, that ink was a green and sulphurous flame, And Antony was pictured in his armor:â Bacchus, turned soldier, painted on the stone. For the ninth time Thoth gave that ibis cry, And called forth that traitor from his tent. He stood, a pillar of flame and smoking gold, And spoke, but as the puppet speaks in shows. Ancestral enemy of Octavianâ He took Octavian's part before these gods,â Every praise of the Italian city For Julius CÃ¦sar's nephew on the throne:â Flattering that crowned Augustus in his seat With all the slanders against Cleopatra Invented by Rome's poets and her priests! And slandering CÃ¦sar's child CÃ¦sarion, Killed by Augustus' sword in Alexandria. A speaking mummy, neither living nor dyingâ A human log, held upright by Anubis, Once the goddess high priests make of girls The queen was more than mortal in her sorrow. More than her thirst and hunger, was deeper still A memory like old poison in deep woundsâ She whispered again, in the face of Set, the deathless:â âCleopatra, the young girl, died when CÃ¦sar died. Only my shadow revelled with Antony, Coming forth by day from this dark hall To win the empire for CÃ¦sarion. Coming forth by day to make my boy The heir of Egypt, Rome, and the purple seasâ As all you high gods knew from the beginning. Only my shadow revelled with Antony, He was the plume of CÃ¦sar, nothing more. Half-republican, then half-Egyptian, Half-clayâhalf-godâthe Rome clay prevailed, He turned against his prince, CÃ¦sarion. ... Then lost at Actium the purple seas. Held in a spell by Set, the god of evil, In a drunkard's dream, Antony chanted then Forgetting his life-hatred of Augustus. He who had called himself before the Senate, âChampion of CÃ¦sar's widow and her son.â There on the terrace of a million years, In a big doll's-voice, Antony chanted then A song the Swan of Avon yet should sing, That all the poets of the world should know. Her eyes were like two rays of the great moon, When Mediterranean storms destroy the ships. She looked at him. And the eyes of Antony, Became the idiot eye-holes of a helmet, The visor down. And his world-flashing sword Was smoke and dustâhis face a wavering flame. In that dim court there stood the great iron scales; âScales of Justice,â known to souls to-day, In one side, the Feather of Perfect Truth, In the otherâthe heart of the waiting dead. Appointed to devour all hearts rejectedâ The crocodile called Ammit glowered and waited. Then Thoth gave Cleopatra âWords of Power.â And Cleopatra called through the dusty court, With the musical voice of all the women of timeâ And the flaming heart there on the iron scales cried: âCleopatra died when CÃ¦sar died. I am the heart of CÃ¦sar, nothing more.â And the Apes of the Dawn beside the scales gave tongue: âShe is the heart of CÃ¦sar, nothing more.â And then Cleopatra spoke alone: âI have knocked at this inner door of my own tomb, Waiting patiently for this my judgment, As all you high gods know, since CÃ¦sar died. We crossed the purple seas for Alexandria Two clouds, blood-red, two storms against the moon. He brought me here, that day, and you judged him. Queens have been crowned, have reigned, and have grown old, Have been sealed in holy tombs with âWords of powerâ: Have come to judgment and to resurrection Since CÃ¦sar knocked with me upon this door, While his body lay in blood in roaring Rome. You set him free, you sent him to the skies! Give me my throne today, beside his throne. When Antony turned against CÃ¦sarion I put the Asp against my naked breast; My Mummy joined my Shadow at this door, My Heart, and Soul and Name, Came to one place. âWhy should the gods keep Cleopatra waiting, A first, and then again a second time, Suffering the mummy's peril and thirst and hunger, Suffering the mummy's fear and hell-fire flame? I, a dead log, cry to be made a god, Above all memory and all forgetting. I, Cleopatra, defy Set, the Accuser, And I stake all on CÃ¦sar and our son. I have called those witnesses now nine times nine, Let Set prevent their coming nevermore! âWhy should this violator of the dead, He who would tear the precious mummy-cloth, He, to whom only mummy-thieves will pray, He, who would rend the helpless flesh and tendon, Stealer of vases of most precious ointment, Counter of beads of lapis-lazuli, Hyena-souled, small-minded, jackdaw-king, Stealer of mummy-crowns and mummy-sandals, Tearing them from the flesh of long-dead men:â Be the wrecker of tombs of godsâstealer of suns? Why should this mole steal heavens and suns from me? âWhy should this one defiler of the earth, Prevent the coming here of Julius CÃ¦sar, Egypt's dazzling Bird of Paradise, The great cock-pheasant and peacock of the world, And the beautiful young prince, CÃ¦sarion, Heir of Egypt, Rome, and the purple seas?â The silent gods half-opened their dull eyes, Isis, in mercy, lifted one slender hand. So, at last, the deathless prayer seemed heard. Thoth, with his chisel, cut in the wall before them, Then painted, Rome's giant hieroglyphicâ Dead CÃ¦sar, with his deep red flowing woundâ Then CÃ¦sar's boy,âHorus CÃ¦sarion,â An exquisite god-prince, naked and fair. Yet patience! Oh, mummy and prisoner, Cleopatra, For that slow, cruel, humorous artist, Thoth, Tantalizer of the souls of men, Painted and carved, for many a racking day, Sword-waving hieroglyphics, that, marching, sang Only at the end: âCome shining forth, Come forth, oh, deathless sons of Amon-Ra.â B.C. 20. Nine years later. CÃ¦sar and CÃ¦sarion at last, Stepped from the wall to the side of Cleopatra And the great queen fell there, like a speaking log, Touching their feet. Her mummy case was wreckedâ A scattered, shattered chrysalis, and tomb. But Cleopatra called through the dusty court, With the musical voice of all the women of timeâ And the flaming heart, there, on the iron scales, cried: âCleopatra died when CÃ¦sar died. I am the heart of CÃ¦sar, nothing more.â But what then of the flame called Antony? It merged into the majesty of CÃ¦sar, Walked with his stride, the shadow of his shadow, Hid in his robe, lost itself in his wound. Had neither vanity nor purpose of its own, Was seen no more. And CÃ¦sar stood there, waiting. Only his crown was brighter now: his whip Shone like a torch above the dusty floor, The light from his eyes like two rays from the moon, When Mediterranean storms destroy the ships. Then Set, the beautiful, the hard, and proud, Ignoring CÃ¦sar and CÃ¦sarion, Called again to the old Egyptian gods, Pointing at the high-throned Alexander, Still the new-comer in that pantheon, Pointing long fingers at the fallen queenâ The mummy cloth, still binding her dead knees, Dried mummy wreaths fallen from her hair:â âThese are invaders, like the Hyksos kings! What have the Ptolemies to do with Egypt? What right had the Macedonian phalanx here? Why are Roman legions on the Nile? Are they enthroned by ancient Amon-Ra?â Then to those gods, the golden CÃ¦sar spoke:â âOh, grief of CÃ¦sar in the heaven of heavens! Without her, thrones are dim and lights are vain! âShe set me on my horse, to win the Parthian crown, We were resolved to conquer utmost Asia, Build again the empire of Thutmose Third, And send the ardent arrows of Amon-Ra, To ultimate Britain and ultimate India, Win new empires for CÃ¦sarion, Heir of Egypt, Rome and the purple seas. But Cassius, Casca and Brutus struck too soon. CÃ¦sar they could endure, but not his heir. They could endure a king, but not a god. They could endure a queen, but not a goddess. And they hated my queen-goddess, Cleopatra. âNo blood was in her veins, but the sun's blood. Sweet Hathor lived in her eyes and her dimpled knees; And here, with open wounds, I praise her yet. I was weary and old, with shadowy ambition. She kissed me into pride and power again. She was the Isis nations make of queens. âShe made me into a son of Amon-Ra, Into Egypt's dazzling bird of paradise, The great cock-pheasant and peacock of the world. With one kiss of her girl-lips, long ago. We dreamed of the Terrace of a Million Years. âThere on the island, where I met her first, This priestess taught me the wisdom of old Thoth, Who hears the wit, and even the sweet singing, Uttered among the humorists of the moon. And when she bore my son CÃ¦sarion, We sailed with him on all the purple seas, We climbed with him to every earthly throne, âThinking of things beyond all human speech. We chanted âThe Chapters of Coming Forth by Day,â Till Thoth, himself, flew in from the wide sea (The ibis with the rakish wing and stride) With the great chapters marching after him, The hieroglyphic soldiers of his heaven, That will go marching, flying and glittering, In all the tombs and capitals of men In all inscriptions of papyrus rolls, In many languages, in picture-plays, Waving stone wings through men's minds forever, When all Rome's regions are but dust and bones, When every arch of triumph has fallen down, When men will fly with iron wings, and speak Across the sky in words that bind the world, And light can shine through earth, through steel, and granite. Those hieroglyphics still will march and sing, Defending gods and all the tombs of gods, From Set and his innumerable train, And all who violate your judgment hall.â The heart of Cleopatra in the balance, Neither rose nor fell, and not one breath Overthrew the Feather of Truth, in the scale.B.C. 11. Nine years after. The god of spices, and incense, and embalming, God of the body's dim eternity. Anubis, the faithful jackal, kept the scales, And warded off the wicked hands of Set. The Feather of Truth, and the heart, kept balance, still. But Set, the hard, the proud, the confident, Set, with the crocodile, Ammit, at his side,â Set, the beautiful, the hard and proud, The devious, the diabolical postponer, Tried, still to outwear her heart, till it fall from the scales Into the monstrous jaws to the second death. He said: âYour fable is yourself in truth, Your rumour is your soul, your name is you To the secret caves of long reÃ«choing time.â Set, the Accuser, lifted his hand of stone And sounds came up from the darkness under the sea And the bones in darkness under all the sands:â âShe poured us out like water and like wine, She wasted us in battle, let her die! She wasted us in battle, let her die!â But what have the gods to do with such complainers? They love the beautiful, the hard and proudâ Only these can wake them from the night. The law's delay among the gods is great. They sleep on shadowy thrones. Their words grow gray. Their ribs are basalt and their faces basalt Cut by the hardest chisels of proud priests, There on The Terrace of a Million Years. High above in the light of each changing year, Priests of the jewelled temples of Abydos, Thinking not of forgotten Cleopatra, Of CÃ¦sar, CÃ¦sarion, or Antony, Sang their sweet songs of the soul's resurrection, Songs to Osiris, âFirst of the Westerners,â Thinking only of their unburied dead, Of mummies to be sealed in their holy tombs.B.C. 2. Nine years later. With quiet gesture and tremendous mien Set still held the gods' too-sleepy eyes. He pointed there to the pitiful prostrate one, Half-mummy, and half-living girl. Her lips Had called in vain for water and for food For years and years, for moments like centuries. More than her thirst and hunger was deeper still A memory like old poison in deep wounds, Antony's treachery to CÃ¦sarion. Anubis, the faithful jackal, fed her smoke, There with iron paws, beat down the snakes of death. Unnoted and unknown to gods or ghosts, To Set or to his suffering prisoner, Anno Domini 1. Strange winds from the uttermost heavens swept the tomb. Said Set, the torturer, the king of hell-fire:â âIf you are the daughter of a god, If you would change your name and take your throne, Command these grave-stones to be made your bread In my great name, proudly defying them. I am the light-god, I am the king of the skies.â Her one virtue, a transcendent scorn, Her one virtue: supernatural pride, Thirst and hunger had made the great queen mad. But still she cried and sang through the dusty court With the musical voice of all the mothers of time, And the flaming heart, too, on the iron scales cried:â âCleopatra died when CÃ¦sar died. I am the heart of CÃ¦sar, nothing more.â Then, then, she was given in mercy The Wisdom of Thoth. Then, though her mummy-face was in the dust, She whispered against the tempter one last spellâ And the pride that would not break conquered the stars:â âMust Set still violate the judgment hall? Let the cold scales be the sole judge of my heart. And as for the kingship of the universe Hail to the true light-god, Amon-Ra, And his Roman son, Caius Julius CÃ¦sarâ Egypt's dazzling bird of paradise, The great cock-pheasant and peacock of the world! Oh, wings of CÃ¦sar, high above all mountains, Wings of CÃ¦sar above the purple seas.â Strange winds from the uttermost heavens swept the tomb, Anno Domini 10. Nine years later. Now the steady hand of Thoth was tremblingâ The artist, king of magic and miracle,â Physician, healer, merciful, at last. He touched her shrivelled hands with reverent love. He touched her gilded eyelids and strained arms. He loosed the mummy bands from thigh and heart. Singing from the ancient Book of the dead, âLift up thy head, oh thou who liest prostrate.â And she was again held upright by Anubis, A speaking mummy, transfigured, and not dying. And she stood pitifully by CÃ¦sar, there, Half-mummy, but half-god: and beautifulâ A soul indeedâa human soul at lastâ The Macedonian glory in her face, Flowering toward Egyptian resurrection. II. She Becomes a Goddess. Anno Domini 19. Nine years later. Strange winds from the uttermost heavens swept the tomb, A mystery and a mercy, still unknown. The ghost of CÃ¦sar swayed like a weed in a storm. And his flaming wound was great in his shadowy side. Still the steady hand of Thoth was trembling Amid his proud, unfaltering picture writing. He shook his Ibis-wing, nodded his head:â For the log had well-nigh changed into the goddess. And the wisest woman of all the mothers of time, Still the secret favorite of shrewd Thoth, Heard now with him the rumours of all nations. (For these two could apprehend and prophecy Further than all those basalt gods there brooding, Further than Set, the accuser of gods and stars.) Strange winds from the uttermost heavens and uttermost tombs! Dim dreams on the march above the universe! Miracles on the edge of the Dead Sea! The little river Jordan roared like doom! There were shoutings and hosannahs among small peoples! Wild fishermen on the Sea of Galilee! Even Anubis lifted his jackal head. There was the incense of a more merciful empire, The beginnings of terrible justice, in the air, Greater than the mercy of Osiris! His power was waning in the Universe, A power was gathering from the deeps and the heights. As a great storm, this power was whirling down, Blowing through mountain ribs, as through silk veils, Potent to make real gods, even of these:â Who sleep on shadowy thrones, whose words grow gray, Whose ribs are basalt and their faces basalt, Cut by the hardest chisels of proud priests. Their hearts were softened while their thrones were shaken, There on The Terrace Of A Million Years. And the cry of Anubis came like a temple gong. And the cry of the woman rang through the dusty hall, With the musical voice of all the mothers of time:â âOh gods of mercy and of majesty, Oh gods of softening hearts and trembling thrones:â When first I came to this my dark tomb door, When I came clamoring for my goddess throne, And CÃ¦sar knocked with me, a suppliant here, You set him free, you sent him to the skies, To mourn for me, to wait for me in vain, Through years and years, and moments like centuries. Give us our thrones to-day beside your thrones!â Still Set was opening his mouth in scorn, âYour rumour is your soul, your name is you,â She stretched frail arms toward all the gods and thrones Arms at last unwrapped from mummy bands, And sang above Set's accusing voice With the voice of a child arising from long sleep, âWhy should the gods of Egypt believe the eternal Accuser, Or the lying poets of Rome? These were the slanders of Rome.â Anno Domini 28. Nine years later. Still Set cried on with his eternal spell, With the old charge that would not be put down:â âYour granite hieroglyphic, still is you! The written rumour of your name is you, To the farthest caves of long reÃ«choing time.â The forty-two assessors and the twelve great gods of Egypt Were growing very old. And their daughter, the pale queen, The last of royal Egypt, was thwarting the Great Accuser. They watched with increasing flame in their vague, hot eyes (Flame like the goldsmith's furnace melting brass) Her still uplifted arms, her advancing step, Her gentle increasing strength, as the years rolled on, The years and years, the moments like centuries. They saw from their rocking thrones, unafraid, unsmiling, That the Feather of Truth fell not from the balance, The flaming heart fell not. But it whispered still:â âI am the heart of CÃ¦sar, nothing more.â Privileged doubter of all gods and stars! Privileged prosecutor of gods and stars! Privileged scourge of men, and gods, and stars:â Set cried boldly: âStill you are Cleopatra! Still mongrel in Egypt, like yonder Alexander! Upstart! Parvenu! Usurper! You are shamed in the eyes of all the women of time. Gambler, Thief, Poisoner and Betrayer! The world will believe my word in the mouths of the poets, And these gods will believe all the golden slanders of Rome!â Barking his terrible bark, he waited and harried, With his ravening hungry monster at his sideâ Set, who had broken the heart of holy Isis Once, in the far beginning of the world:â Set, who had murdered, then tried the good Osiris, Before this very court of the basalt gods Still stood unsmitten in the Osirian court Though The Merciful King, now at the top of his stairway, Ruled, and justified all the pure of heart. Strange winds from the uttermost heavens swept the tomb Blowing through mountain ribs as though silk veils, Then all the old years fell from The Merciful King, New youth came with new mercy to Osiris:â He, First of the Westerners, lifted his shepherd's crook, Isis, The Mother, lifted one slender hand, Thoth, the Great-hearted, lifted his Ibis wing To the very roof of the black basalt hall. And the walls were as the walls of the great full moon. And that Macedonian Cleopatra Glorious as Hera, blazing like Psyche the bride, Was dressed now in strange spiritual snow-white. And so, transfigured, and with power transcendent In her arms, the little child, CÃ¦sarion:â She fixed her eyes on mighty Alexander, With the gods, a stone-carved son of Amon-Ra, On the Trembling Terrace of a Million Years. She prayed, with CÃ¦sar there by her snowy shoulder:â âOh son of Amon-Ra, called the Macedonian,â Oh one man CÃ¦sar envied, Oh, Alexander! Oh conqueror, your great mother bore you To Egypt's golden sun-god long ago. And so it was you came to take your kingdom In our beautiful oasis, Sekhet-Amit, And there it was that Amon-Ra came down To claim you, and my father, Ptolemy, As Egypt's kings his Macedonian sons! You set my fathers on Egyptian throne, Giving, in love, their queens to Amon-Ra.â Then CÃ¦sar, CÃ¦sarion and the queen Prayed toward the basalt throne of Alexander:â âGive us our thrones to-day, beside your throne.â He stretched his priest carved arms in miracle, Stepped from the swaying terrace in strange might, Stepped from the terrace with that wild assurance He once rode trembling lands and fearful seas, A blazing sun, hidden within that tomb, A god and king and peacock of the world, Unshaken, though the heavens and earth were shaken, CÃ¦sar, his brother, there, eternally. He gave into each right hand the terrible lotos, That sends forth stars and suns in yellow pollen. He gave them on their foreheads, holy seals From the lotos cup of the Egyptian heavens. The God-cup there ended the thirst of the dead. And the flaming wound in CÃ¦sar's side was healed. And the terrible lotos blooms dropped stars like jewels. Gone was the hieroglyphic of Cleopatra From the tomb-walls and from the coffin-lids. Gone was the fabled wife of Antony. Gone was all former meaning of her name. The blood of Mecedon had left her veins. All the goddesses there on their thrones, Shook sweet Hathor's sistrum like soft bells. And they called her: âHathor's-body-and-heart-and-soul.â And they called her: âHathor's-laughter-and-true-name.â Her ears became the tiniest humorous calf's-ears, Like sweet and humorous Hathor's masquerade, When she dances among the half-grown girls and boys. Then her white robe fell like snow blown from a cliff. She stood there the brown Hathor, Queen of the Nile! An airy, girl-Egyptian, full of whims, Tender, innocent, marvellously youngâ A black-eyed girl with body of tawny gold. But still she cried, and her heart from the iron scales cried:â âCleopatra died when CÃ¦sar died.â Leaving the scales, where for long years it had waited, Her heart flew back to her breast forevermore, Justified! Justified! Before the good Osiris. The Name, âOsiris,â now blazing on her breast, As on the breasts of CÃ¦sar, and her boy. Leaving the scales, where for long years it had waited, The Feather of Truth flew to the forehead of Isis, Plume of the mother, the merciful mother, Isis, Plume of the Queen, whose victory is the Truth. Thoth cut the great verdict on the wall, And the new names of the Queen, that the great gods cried, Picture-names they invented each new hour:â âEyes-of-Love,â âMy Lady-Is-As-Gold,â âBeautiful-Kitten,â âLittle-Wild-Lion-Girl.â The law's delay among the gods was ended. CÃ¦sar, with the perfect eye of the elder Horus, Wearing the ancient crowns of the south and the north, The Queen, clothed in the ravishing form of Hathor, And their beautiful son, the heir, CÃ¦sarion, Heir of Egypt, Rome, and the purple seas;â These three, the last of the Egyptian Triadsâ Flamboyant, triumphant, magnificent, Chanted âThe Chapters of Coming Forth by Day,â As in old days, chanted the golden chapters. The âWords of Powerâ swept through the dusty hall, Fulfilling there all the magic of Thoth, The love of Osiris for the wise and just, The love of Amon-Ra for his little children,â Vindicating that strange wind from heaven That still as one more mystery, shook the tomb. There, there, was more than Egyptian resurrection. III. She is Lifted with the Old Gods into the Western Sky The walls widened, and were the horizon's rim. The roof arched up, and was the infinite sky. Where were those gods, who had lived in priest-carved stone? Their souls were high above the universe. Their outspread plumes now filled the uttermost heavens In the marvellous west, where all our dead have gone. CÃ¦sar, CÃ¦sarion, and the Queen, (She was no longer Cleopatra), The last to be raised to heaven through heathen pride, Wearing sandals of lapis-lazuli, In a moment were one flash of ascending light. They climbed blue steps, and sat with the good Osiris, At the top of his stairway, âFirst of the Westerners,â Bowered in the flowers of the deep western heavens, There where the terrible star-lotus blooms. They took their thrones with the forty-two assessors, With the four sons of Horus, and with Sekmet, With Thoth and Maat, and the Memphian Chivalry, Anubis and King Menes and his train. They took their thrones with Isis and with Nepthys, Hatshepsut, Tiy and the strange Ikhnaton, With Alexander, with the Ptolemies, With Amon-Ra, and his Macedonian sons. She stood with young CÃ¦sarion in her arms, She stood with shadowy CÃ¦sar in that sky. She kissed him into pride and power again. Beneath their feet were every sun and star, The Thrones and The Terrace of a Million Years, And time, and fear, and the whirling universe. And the Book of the Dead was rolled up for that day. The judgment scene was ended. Far below The priests of the jewelled temples of Abydos, Thinking not of the forgotten Queen, (She who was no longer Cleopatra), Of CÃ¦sar, CÃ¦sarion, or Antony, Sang their sweet songs of the soul's resurrection, Song to Osiris, âFirst of the Westerners,â Thinking only of their beloved dead, Of mummies newly sealed in their holy tombs. Set, the beautiful, the hard and proud, Stealer of vases of most precious ointmentâ Stealer of red, pitiful, human heartsâ Determined still to win the universe, Set, the Accuser, victor in his fashion, Since, to accuse, to him was victory, Insulter of judges and stars to the highest sky, He, who accused Job long ago, In the judgment hall of Jehovah of the Jews, Then laid his hand upon him through long years:â Set, the Accuser, resuming his name of Satan, Wearing sandals of hell-fire, laughing, not smiling, Barking his terrified bark, marched far to the north, There to accuse and tempt in the Dead Sea Desert, And on a pinnacle of King Herod's temple, And on a flower-decked mountain of meditation:â The son of a girl, fairer than Cleopatra, A son of Amon-Ra, prouder than CÃ¦sar, And lovelier than the young CÃ¦sarion. On reading the latest proof of this poem, I have found a book that elaborately confirms the political hypothesis:ââThe Life and Times of Cleopatra, Queen of EgyptâA Study in the Origin of the Roman Empire,â by Arthur Weigall, published by Thomas Butterworth, Limited, 15 Bedford Street, London W.C. 2; and G. P. Putnam's Sons, 2 West 45th Street, New York City. But the same idea may be found in Ferrero's âGreatness and Decline of Rome,â in all the comment on Cleopatra. I have outlined this poem of mine as a possible photoplay in âThe Art of the Moving Picture,â pages 254â260.</field>
