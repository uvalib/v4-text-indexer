      <field name="fulltext">ADDITIONAL POEMS 1838â1894 AND UNDATED AN UNPUBLISHED POEM FOR THE BOSTON SOCIETY OF MEDICAL IMPROVEMENT FEBRUARY 7, 1838? This evening hour which grateful memory spares From evening toil and unrequited cares; These curling lips, these joy revealing eyes, These mirthful tones, re-echoing as they rise, These friendly pledges on this festal shrine, The glistening goblet and the flowing wine, This genial influence which the coldest heart Warms to receive and opens to impart, Mock the poor Art who does her subjects wrong And steals from Pleasure all she wastes in Song. Yet since you ask this feeble hand to strew Wreathes on the flowers and diamonds on the snow, Take all it bears, and if the gift offend, Condemn the Poetâspare! oh! spare the friend! Yes, while I speak, some magic wand appears Shapes the long past, oh! say not happier years, The lawless fancies, yet untaught to know The charms of reason, or the scourge of woe; The boyish dreams now melting into air; The virgin forms, alas! no longer fair; The scattered friends, with many a tear resigned, Once all our own, now mingled with mankind; Since, save in memory, ye appear no more In the bright present, let the Past live o'er. Still in the heart, some lingering spark remainsâ You cannot chase it from the shrinking veins. Grief comes too early; Pleasure ne'er too late. Snatch the fair blossom, whatsoe'er its date; If youth still charms thee, mirth is justly thine; If age has chilled thee, lo!âthe generous wine! Oh! thoughtless revellers! when you set my task, How little dreamed you of the toil you asked. How shall I please you?âI, a grave young man, Whose fate is drudgery on âthe useful plan.â How can I coax you, smooth you, comb you down, And cheat your frontals of that awful frownâ Portentous scowl! which marks in every age The blistering, clystering, tooth-extracting sage? A verse too polished will not stick at all; The worst back scratcher is a billiard ball. A rhyme too rugged would not hit the point, Its loose legs wriggling in and out of joint. Shall I be serious, touching, lachrymose; Mix tears with wine and give you all a dose? But well-filled stomachs have not room for grief, For sips and sighs, for porter and roast beef. Shall I be learned, and with punch and claw, Dig stumps of Greek from every Ancient's jaw? But who quotes Cuvier when he feasts on snipe, Or reads Gastritis when his wife cooks tripe? Not all the wisdom of recorded time Can change one titbit to concocted chyme. Not all the schools from Berkshire to the Nile Can melt one sausage into milky chyle. Nor all the Galens since Deucalion's flood Change lifeless pudding into living blood. Then Heavenly Muse, avert thy rolling eyes, Lest in their sight unlicked creations rise; Or should those linger in the wanton air, Pull off thy girdle and unbind thy hair; Come not like Juno to such scenes as this; Too proud to play with, and too prim to kiss; But wild and careless as some slip-shod maid, Oh! classic Broad street, in thy fragrant shade, With braidless ringlets, tangled, tumbling down, And blue-veined bosom gleaming through her gown, And all the lovelier for a casual streak Of smutty semblance in her damask cheek; Nor over conscious should her flounces fly To Love's half tide-mark, when his waves are high. Our noble Art, what countless shoals invade, Some as a science, many as a trade. In every column quackery has its line; From every corner stares the Doctor's sign; From every shore the straining vessel tugs Ill-scented balsams, stomach turning drugs. The keels of commerce clear the farthest surge, Lest some old beldam want her morning purge. The seaman wanders on his venturous route To turn a baby's stomach inside out. Rich were the Queen of yon hepatic isle With half her subjects squander on their bile; Rich were Van Buren, could he pay his bills With half his people waste on Brandreth's pills, Or with their products fill his farmers' carts With tare and tret for reproductive parts. If one great truth defies the skeptic's scorn That truth is thisâthat children must be born; If one great maxim, man dare not deny, That maxim isâthat mortal man must die. If long experience be not all a trick, Who dares to say that mortals can't be sick? These solemn truths, by thinking minds allowed, Lift the stern reasoner above the vulgar crowd. From every truth some vast conclusion flowsâ Truth is the pump, and reason is its nose; Its handle, logic; work it, and it brings Transcendent streams from transcendental springs. Heaven surely ordered on Creation's morn This mighty lawâthat children must be born. Hence came the science, thou dost show so well With white fore fingerâMadame Lachapelle; Hence came the forceps, hence the screw to pinch The soul's own viscus to half an inch; Hence came the weapons, which the embryos bore Left in the lurch, their brains escaped before,â A trivial damage, since so oft we find That babes grow up, who left their brains behindâ Hence came the fillet, whence the infant wretch Mistakes the midwife for her friend Jack Ketch; Hence came the lever, which the toothless fry Take for a crowbar, when the monsters pry; Hence the scooped pinchers, with the fangs between, Skull-crushing Davisâthy divine machineâ Hence all the âclaptraps,â potent to extract The hero struggling in his closing act. So the stout foetus, kicking and alive Leaps from the fundus for his final dive; Tired of the prison where his legs were curled, He pants like Rasselas for a wider world. No more to him their wonted joys afford The fringed placenta and the knotted cord; No longer liberal of his filial thanks, He drums his minuets on his mother's flanks; But nobly daring, seeks the air to find Through paths untrodden, spite of waves or wind. Hush decent muse and leave such things as these To modest Maygrier and concise Dewees. As some green school girl, who at morn forgets, Lost in strange thoughts her wanton pantalets, Squats, stoops and straddles, while the passers stare Alas! unconscious that her limbs are bare, So thou, forgetful that another spies Things which escape thy unsuspecting eyes Would'st freak and gambol while thy neighbors see The white warm flesh above thy gartered knee. Thus with the entrance of the first born man The reign of Science o'er the earth began. Nurse of his weakness, soother of his woes, She waits and watches till his sorrows close; Nor yet she leaves him when the undying mind Flits from his clay and leaves the frame behind. If thou should'st wonder that mankind must die, Ask the Curator of our Museum, why? When man's immortal, who had ever seen The stomach, colon, kidneys, pancreas, spleen? Each pickled viscus, every varnished bone, Seducing scirrhus and attractive stone? Lost to the world, had never come to grace Our well filled phials in their padlocked case. Unknown to fame had Morgagni sighed And Louis floated down oblivion's tide. On âBrunner's glandsâ no cheering ray had shone, And âPeyerâ claimed no âpatchesâ but his own. Science untaught her scalpel to employ. Had seen no Ileum since the days of Troy; And man the ruler of the storms and tides Had groped in ignorance of his own insides. Thus the same art that caught our earliest breath Lives with our life and lasts beyond our death. Man, ever curious, still would seek to save Some wreck of Knowledge from the waiting grave. Yet keen-eyed searcher into Nature's laws, Slight not the suffering while thou reck'st the cause. How poor the solace, when thy patients die, To tell the mourners all the reasons why. Love linked with Knowledge crowns thy angel art; Gold buys thy science; Heaven rewards thy heart. Between two breaths, what worlds of anguish lie; The first short gasp, the last and long drawn sigh. Thou who hast aided with coercive thumbs The red-legged infant, kicking as it comes; Thou who hast tracked each doubtful lesion home With probe and scissors, knife and enterotome; Short is the opening; short the closing scene; But a long drama fills the stage between. Nor deem it strange, since every season flings Its sun or cloud on life's unguarded springs; Since song or science, love of fame, or truth, All feed like vampires on the brow of youth; Since the red goblet shakes the hand that grasps And hot-cheeked beauty wastes the form she clasps; One half mankind should spend their time to make The pills and draughts the other half must take. Oh! fertile source of never failing wealth, Mysterious faith! thou alchemist of health; But for thy wand, how vainly should we strive To cure the world and keep ourselves alive! Not all the fruit the yellow harvest yields, When the curved sickle sweeps the rustling fields; Not all the stores the deep-sunk vessel brings When India's breezes swell her perfumed wings: Not all the gems, whose wild Auroras shine Through the black darkness of Golconda's mine, Can match the profits thou dost still dispense To thy best favoritesâEase and Impudence, Who find Golconda in a case of gout Or rich Potosi in a baby's clout; And gather ingots, ever fresh and hot Smelt, but not smelted, in a chamber-pot. Small is the learning which the patients ask When the grave Doctor ventures on his task; To greet the Quack admiring hundreds come, Whose wisdom centers in his fife and drum; Why should'st thou study, if thou canst obtain A wig, a gig, an eye glass or a cane? Greenest of greenhorns, know that drugs like these Are the best weapons to subdue disease. Should'st thou not flourish by enacting lies, Step into print, good friend, and advertise; And in the âPost,â the âHerald,â or the âSunâ Thus let thine honest manifestoes run: That great physician, learned Dr. C. F. R. S., Staff-surgeon and M.D.â Lately from London; now at number âfourâ Left side of North Street (Don't mistake the door), May be consulted for life's various ills; Where's also sold the patent âPickwick Pills.â What grieves the Doctor, is that all mankind To their own good should be so shocking blind. He could not stand it, but relief imparts The grateful feeling of a thousand hearts; His fee is nothing; 'tis his conscious skill, Backed by the virtues of the âPickwick Pill,â That prompts the Doctor to dispense his cure To all mankind, and also to the poor. What is dyspepsia? When the humors vile, The cardiac sphincter closes on the bile. What cures dyspepsia?âWhy, the Doctor's skill, Consult by letter, and enclose a bill. What's fluor albus? 'Tis a term we know From âalbusââwhite, and âfluor,â Greek, to flow. 'Tis the great pest of lovely woman's lifeâ Females treated through the Doctor's wife. What's gonorrhoea?âA disease so called From âgonorââwater, and from ârheaââscald. In some rash moment, when unguarded youth Strays from the path of reason and of truth, The poison enters, the disease is hatched; See your case cured, not plastered up and patched. N.B.âNo money till the patient's cured. P.S.âThe utmost secrecy insured. Observe! the Doctor has a private door; Green blinds, no steps, back stairs, and second floor. Of testimonials, which have come in heaps, But two small cartloads now the Doctor keeps; They were too numerous for the public eyes; Hence the small number which he now supplies. John Smith of Bostonâaged âthirty-fiveâ Is much surprised to find himself alive, Which justly owing, as he thinks must be, Half to his Maker, half to Doctor C. Had a stuffed feeling, used to wake in starts, Had wind and rumbling in the inward parts, Had swelled stomach, used to vomit some, Was often squeamish, thought his brains were numb, Had fell away, could not digest his food, Had tried all physicsânothing did him goodâ In short was dying with his numerous ills, âCured by three doses of the Pickwick Pills.â The Doctor's skill, the sluggard clergy owns, As in this note from Reverend Judas Jones: âDear Sir, The blessing of the Lord attend You and your ointment, called âThe loafer's friend,â My worthy wife, the partner of my toils, Like Job of old, has suffered from the âboils,â Some on her fingers, wherewithal she knits, Some on her person, whereupon she sits, Which quite unfit her, when her ail returns, To do her duties by her small concerns. Since times are hard, and earthly comforts dear, And Gospel harvests come but once a year, With my good deacon, I resolved to halve One precious box of your unrivalled salve. With heaven's kind blessing, and one hearty rub, We chased away this leprous Beelzebub. Enough was left to cure our warts and styes, And six great pimples on my handmaid's thighs. Please send three boxes, by the earliest hand To Judas Jones, your servant at command. P. S. Your pills have cured my baby's fits; I'll write particulars if the Lord permits.â The following letter sent to Doctor C. Comes from Barrabas Waterpot, M. D.: âDear Sir, The duties which I owe mankind, Have made it proper I should speak my mind; And while my breast an honest conscience fills, I can but praise the patent âPickwick Pills.â I have no interest in the pills at stake And never sell them and but rarely take. Fit for the welfare of a suffering race, Their many virtues, I now feebly trace: When taken fasting, they the strength maintain; When on full stomach, they deplete the brain; One pill relieves the almost drowning thirst; Two, keep one sober, though he drink to burst. One pill a week cures Phthisis and the Gout; One half a pill will keep the measles out. Rubbed on the fingers they destroy the itch; Worn next the skin, Lumbago and the stitch, Though, like a corkscrew they the bowels search, A curious factâthey never work in church! Small children take them with advantage great, As also ladies in a certain state. In short, this medicine every want fulfils, I give no physic but the âPickwick Pills.â Please print this letter, which of use may be, (Signed) Barrabas Waterpot, M. D.â Here's a small postscript Doctor C. left out Of small importance to the public doubt: âThe pills sell brisklyâtwenty gross or more, Send a fresh parcel to the grocer's store; Put in more jalap; never mind expense, Folks must be griped or grudge their fifty cents. Put up two sizes, one three times as small, For little brats; the big ones kill them all. I want my pay, you poison pounding knave Send me good billsâHow like the D-1 you shave.â All this well printed, and with bigger type Words like Dyspepsia, Liver, Humor, Gripe, Two solid columns in the âTimesâ would fill And make thy fortune by the âPickwick Pill.â But thou, poor dreamer, who hast rashly thought To live by knowledge which thy bloom has bought; Thou who hast waited with a martyr's smileâ Hope gently whisperingââYet a whileââ Too proud to stoop beneath thy nobler aim, While prostrate meanness crawls to wealth and fame; Thou, all unfriended, while a thousand fools Vaunt their raw cousins, reeking from the schools, Go, scorn the art that every boon denies, 'Till age sits glassy in thy sunken eyes; Go, scorn the treasury which withholds its store Till hope grows cold, and blessings bless no more. Peace to our banquet; let me not prolong, Its nearest moments with my idle song. This measured tread of ever marching rhyme, Like clockwork, pleases only for a time; Too long repeated makes our heart so sick We cut the weights to stop its tedious click. Let sweeter strains our opening hearts inspire, The listening echoes tremble round the lyre. Dance Bacchus! hours of labor come again, To lock the rivets of our loosened chain. Shine, star of evening, with thy steadiest ray, To guide us homeward on our devious way. SUNG AT THE HUNT NAUSHON ISLAND NOVEMBER 1? 1838 Ye Colonels Councillors and Squires That You may all remember That hunting of the Island deer That happened this November, I've written out a little song To give you decent warning Between the first and second gongs All of a Thursday morningâmorning, morning, all of a Thursday morning. At 7 Oclock on Tuesday morn They roused each ancient dreamer With hunting gun &amp; powder horn To go on board the steamer So when they got us all on board They made the water boil and In half a shake they had us down Upon the little Island Island, Island, upon the little Island The Governor &amp; his suite were there To bid us welcome gaily With broad brimmed hat &amp; long tailed coat Which is his habit daily. The air was soft, the sky was blue The Isle was all before us And whelp and hound were baying round All joining in the chorus chorus, chorus, all joining in the chorus But just before We took our stand, We all went in the closet When each pet bank beneath our ribs Received a small deposit And when the lunch was stowed below And fingers all were wipÃ©d We stroked that little pig you know That is so very stripÃ©d. stripÃ©d, stripÃ©d, that is so very stripÃ©d. Then off we sett to scour the woods With our unhappy drivers Uncertain if the deer or they Would be the days survivors But having safely met at last And all our laurels housing The knowing ones made bets on wine And there was some carousing carousing, carousing, and there was some carousing The first days victim was a Doe Shot by Nantucket Upton They say he dodged a little though Or else his toes she trod on Then Clifford thought that he must fire Peabody fain would hit too With William, Holmes &amp; many more But all their Does were dittos dittos, dittos, but all their Does were dittos On Wednesday morn the doctors twain Went in a new direction For once they could not kill 'twas plain So took to resurrection And with them in the little boat The Speaker too did seat him Perhaps 'twas by a special vote That body rose to meet him to meet him, to meet him, that body rose to meet him The second day now blazed away Each doubled barrelled hero They made the number up to ten If ten is one and Zero The night before We drank until The wines ran from our scuppers Which made us on the second night Like Deacons at their suppers suppers, suppers, like Deacons at their suppers Tomorrow I shall add a verse To finish out the story In which I shall at length rehearse The Candidates for glory Long live the glorious Governor For whom my song was written I should have finished it tonight But that I was frost bitten bitten, bitten, but that I was frost bitten AT DARTMOUTH PHI BETA KAPPA, JULY 24, 1839 These tranquil shades, where Nature unconfined Flings her green drapery on the mountain wind, These smiling hillsides, which our river queen Wreathes in wild blossoms as she winds between, If dear to those who never learned to stray Far from the shadows where their cradles layâ How sweet to him whom many a wind has blown To shores less loved if lovelier than his own! How soft to him whose weary feet have trod The burning pavement, is the dewy sodâ How fair to him is every nameless flower Whose painted disk recalls some infant hour; How free to him the wide horizon seemsâ How glad the music of the mountain streamsâ How pure the breeze whose restless wings have fanned The tossing fringes of his forest landâ While rose lipped Summer robes in all her charms The living landscape locked in Nature's arms. If scenes like these the wanderer's heart inspire With lingering sparkles of forgotten fire, If tired with tumult and the noisy strife That chokes with dust the crowded paths of life He turns with rapture from the thronging street To rest and silence in their calm retreat Not so with all. The maid in russet gown, The blue frocked plough boy, pant alike for town, The solemn umpires of our health and laws Who ask more patients, practice or applause, Nay, the grave preacher, who for meagre hire Quotes Greek and Latin to astound the squire Filled with high visions as the rattling mail Rolls with its burden from their quiet vale Forgetting patients, practice, parish, all Dream of some âopeningââsome inviting âcallââ Alas! Too anxious for an ampler space To flourish, flutter, sputter or grimaceâ Or in the phrase that suits a saintly ear To be more useful in a wider sphere. From the still hamlet to the noisy mart The home of Nature to the throne of Art As led by fate the wanderer's footsteps tend What varied colors oer the landscape blend! What changing scenes the curious eye will find To strike the senses or enchain the mind!â If themes like these can stay the wheels of time Forged by rude memory into ruder rhyme Some listless moments may be whiled away By the dull cadence of my slipshod lay. Tis summer's noonâand blazing fiercely down The dazzling sunbeams gild the glittering town Bathed in their light, from every lofty spire Its wheeling symbol burns in starry fire Each sombre turret lifted calm and high Prints its cold outline on the sultry sky,â Mingling and glimmering in the flickering glow Palace and hovel spread their roofs belowâ So gleams the surface, but surveyed more near Its fancied glories melt and disappear; The baffled winds that stagnate ere they meet Scarce lift the dust that strews the arid street. No clustering foliage checks the burning ray But scanty awnings line the glaring wayâ From gaping windows mingling sounds ariseâ The nurse that threatens and the child that cries The flute's hoarse lisp that speaks some shop boy's art Who kills an hour by murdering poor Mozart The clink of hammersânot on warriors' mails, But closing rivets in disjointed pails The clash of steelâof most unwarlike knivesâ From platesânot breast-platesâtaking meals, not lives; The hiss of fountainsâsoda founts alas! That pour their treasures at so much a glass So bursts the chorus led sublimely off By lusty infants, black with hooping cough While the vexed pavement by the cart wheel ground Growls a rough bass to swell the mighty sound, And loud and long the jarring discord rings Like the last crash of all created things! âTurn to the spot where Nature's laws maintain Their ancient empire over hill and plain Look when the forest waving wild and high Braids its deep fringes on the sultry skyâ In those calm depths no living sound is heard Save the light carol of the summer bird Or the low rustling of the leafy crest Whose plaited shelter screens his rocking nest Or whispering waters, which with languid flow Steal in soft channels through the flowers below;â Hush! for thy voice will wrong the peaceful scene Where all is shadowy, solemn and serene. Around thy pathway floats the trailing vine And breathes the fragrance of the balmy pine Beneath thy feet the perfumed turf is spread Fresh with the dew those glossy leaves have shed, Through the dark tracery that above thee bends In checkered gleams the trembling ray descendsâ Lookâbreatheâand listen! Say, if mortal power With gold and purple clothed thy lonely bower Smoothed the rude soil and chained the wandering stream And bared the wild flowers to the noontide beam Would all it lavished from its wealth repay The tangled sweetness which it swept away? âThe dead of winter! chained in ice and snow The wreck of autumn slumbers dark and low The silent streamlet fills its frozen bed As if still lingering by the flowers it fed. The jagged hemlock splintered in the storm Frowns oer the forest with its crested form The strong armed oak, his garlands cast aside Stands like an athlete in his naked pride The slanting sunbeam glimmers faint and chill O'er the choked valley and the whitened hill, The leaf has faded and the bird has flown And all is voicelessâDeath is Lord alone! âNot such the scene where man usurps the sway To change with art the empire of decay For him no winter bids the blushing rose Shrink from the breeze beneath the drifting snows Nay, the frail nurseling torn from tropic skies Warmed by his care the arctic storm defies His tendriled vines their purple orbs display Ere the first violet dares the breath of May The golden cone that loads the dark-leaved pine Breathes with the fragrance of the burning vine The bright plumed prisoner waves his yellow wing Amidst the blossoms of an endless spring So wills the pleasure of imperial Man As if in mockery of his Maker's plan. Nor less transformed the midnight hours that call The gay and fair to many a gilded hall While the hoarse wind is raving hoarsely round From yon bright scene the merry voices sound The blazing lustre sheds its radiance o'er Those graceful shapes that trip the bounding floor What though the storm is raging fierce and wildâ No wind is rude to fortune's favored childâ Round her white neck the circling jewels glow Like sparkling flashes on the moonlight snow No envious drapery oer its beauty weaves Blanched to the whiteness of the lily's leaves That fragile form no ruder robes enfold Than the flowered tissue clasped with fretted gold Those twinkling feet, in slenderest satin bound Trace their light circles guiltless of a sound The curtained walls the wreathes of summer wear And faint with fragrance breathes the balmy air And flushing maidens court the gale that swings The close drawn curtain on its gilded wingsâ âStrong is gray Winterâfor his arms can rend The living rock and bid the forest bend, But man is mightier for he scales his throne And breaks his sceptre to extend his own! âIs man the same, where'er his fortune falls, Left to himself, or caged in crowded walls? Ask the pert cockney, who, the pink of town Greets some rough cousin, raw, and just come downâ Ask the stout rustic when the cit descends With gloves and cane among his country friends! âJohnââsays the first âThat hat of yours was made âAbout the time that Noah's keel was laidâ âWho built that coat? The bill was monstrous large âIf extra puckers made a separate charge âDon't swing that stickâhow every body stares âPray did you think the town was full of bears âWhy, how you stampâwho ventured to abuse âThe feet of man with such a pair of shoes? âLook there! Why bless me!âNow, upon my wordâ âThose cotton stockingsâaren't they too absurd, âAnd that striped waistcoat and that checked cravat âUpon my honor but you are a flat!â âTomâ says the rustic, when, the greeting past, He gets the cockney on his farm at lastâ âYou're mighty knowingâdon't you think you know âHow to thresh wheat?âor would you rather mow? âThereâtake that stickâthat's what we call a flail âDon't break your headâwhat makes you look so pale? âAhâthere you have itâpray don't make me laugh. âHit where you will you'll scatter lots of chaff! âWell then, the scytheâcomeâgentlyâdon't be rash âTake off those glovesâahâthere's an ugly gashâ âCome home with meânext time I'll show you how âWalk straight along and never fear the cow âKeep those French boots from off my uncut grass âI'm sorry, Cousin, but you are an ass! âFrom dress and manners if we turn to find The graver contrasts of the inward mind How vast the gulf our wondering eye must scan From clashing crowds to isolated man! âFew are the cares the simple rustic knows, So calm the current of his being flows; The changing hues that paint the living scene With autumn's brown or spring's rekindled green The fruits and herbage as by turns they yield Their ripened treasures in his cultured field The flight of birds that chase their shifting clime These are his dials for the lapse of time. Far from the world, no jarring tones intrude To break the stillness of his solitudeâ His wayward fancies few are found to share And ceaseless toil demands his daily careâ Few are his sorrowsâsuch as Heaven ordained And soothed by tears unseen and unrestrained. His pleasures tranquil, yet not loved the less Than the brief raptures wooed by wild excess; When from his arm its manly strength has past Life's wasting flame burns gently to the last Taught by long years, his trembling lips inform The listening reapers of the rising stormâ Bent down with age, and tottering to his tomb His eye still gladdens in the summer's bloomâ Slowly he fades, while faces fresh and fair Crowd with sweet smiles around his ancient chair Till by kind hands his reverend form is laid In the still churchyard where so oft he strayed By those he loved he finds his lowly bed, And oer his mound the grassy turf is spread, His life unwritten on the roles of fame, But love still lingering oer his humble name. âBut who is he, whose shattered form appears Bowed by long care and sapped by wasting years? Through the dense mart that ancient shape is known The halls of trade those feeble accents own In these dark walls the busy years have sped Whose winters whiten on his trembling head The field, the forest, and the mountain stream To him are shadows of his boyhood's dream The narrow circle where his footsteps range These strips of pavement centering in exchange; That stony glance no artful words beguileâ He looks and hears, while others speak and smile; If this be man, how changed by selfish toil From man the monarch of the virgin soil! âYet scorn not him whose withered hands uphold In thin cold grasp the dynasty of gold;â He speaksâhis accents, wafted oer the seas Blend with the sigh of India's farthest breezeâ His quivering fingers trace a single line, And bar and bolt obey the mighty sign Through steel and stone the silent mandate goes And sunless vaults their golden hoards disclose; Yet in his garb the sneering stranger's eye Reads the rude marks of threadbare poverty And the gay spendthrift with contemptuous air Crowds from the walk the humble millionaireâ The lord of wealth, which Fortune when she gave Cramped with one shackleââthou shalt be a slave A slave to toil that ceases but with life One sleepless task one ever wearing strife Till o'er thy grave the curse and blessing blends Of smiling heirs and unremembered friends! Can this be all that queenly Commerce brings When o'er the deep she spreads her myriad wingsâ To grasp the means without the will to use Less pleased with gain than anxious not to lose To wean the sense from all that Heaven bestows And coin to gold each drop of blood that flows? If such the gift her glittering robes conceal Trust not thy fate to fortune's rolling wheelâ The lavished treasures of the earth and sky Around, above thee, and beneath thee lie For thee they blossom, and for thee they shine, Unbought by suffering, they at least are thine! âAt every step some little trace we find That varying habits print upon the mind; The simpler rustic talks with sense profound On all the marvels of the country round, Whose horse is deadâwho stole his neighbor's henâ Whose dog kills sheepâwhose pig has left his penâ Who staid from church,and what the deacon saidâ Whose child is sickâwhose grandpapa is dead, Whose farm is mortgaged for his barroom bills Whose desperate case was cured by Brandreth's pills Whose buxom lady rules her passive spouseâ Whose milder helpmeet milks her husband's cowsâ And themes like these, whose mighty rumor rolls Through the small world of half a thousand souls. Not so the gossips of the striving town Where every mail with news is breaking down Then every hour some pleasing tale attends Or precious scandal which the journal lends;â For them no fire is worthy of the name If scores of buildings do not sink in flameâ Morn brings its murder with their breakfast rolls Noon leaves a steamboat thumping on the shoals The evening paper tells them whereabout Some thief broke in or chicken pox broke out Or how some worthy of undoubted wealth Has struck for Texasâto restore his healthâ (His land of promise, but of small delight To the blank holders of his notes at sight) Duels and deaths, the wedding and the puffâ Tales for the tender, slanders for the tough, A web of fact, which fancy weaves at will Through the sly shuttle of a scribbler's quill: That is the draught that simple truth supplies And tart the flavor of unmingled lies; Like soda powders wrapped in white and blue To make them sparkle you must mix the two. âSo reeks the city with eternal tales Of births, deaths, weddings, fires, wrecks, riots, gales. The poet's caution would be idle thereâ âNil admirariââyou must never stare; Tell an old townsman that you just have learned On Monday next our planet will be burned, To him the tidings will not bring surprise, Nor chalky cheeks, nor saucer spreading eyes;â â'Twill beat the fireworks,â he perhaps will say âThat made such fun on Independence day,â Or if a tradesman will express a hope Ashes will fall and sink the price of soap! âAs some vast lake where thousand currents tend And chafe and glitter as their waters blend Now fresh and stainless from their mountain home, Now by rough channels scourged to eddying foam Or darkly turbid, as with sullen toil They sweep in shadow through the loosening soil Flung from tall cliffs in many a bright cascade Or creeping voiceless through the leafy shade, So in the scene of man's tumultuous strife Mingle and melt the murmuring waves of life. âThere he that basks in fortune's noontide blaze Spreads his gay honors to the vulgar gaze There the pale artist writes his lowly name And faints for bread to feed the vulture fame There haggard vice secures her last retreat And shameless hearts grow harder as they meet There the lost exile, friendless and alone Broods o'er his grief unknowing and unknown There passion's victim in the careless throng In deepening guilt forgets her girlhood's wrong And pallid shapes unnoticed as they fade With trembling lips implore the stranger's aid And wearied age, unconscious of repose, And sickly childhood, born to want and woes Joined by stern fate in one tumultuous sphere In one dark vortex roll and disappear. âBetween two breaths what worlds of anguish lie The first short gasp, the last and long drawn sigh; If thou would'st hear the ceaseless groans that rise And count the tears that fall from joyless eyes And read the lines of misery and despair Seek the wide cityâthou wilt find them there. Turn to yon dome whose dreary arches spread Their sullen shelter o'er the wanderer's headâ Where the last act of life's poor drama ends In the cold walls that sorrowing mercy lends. That sinewy shape, whose shrunken forms reveal The strength once centering in its nerves of steel, In fruitless toil its stormy day has past To ask a grave from charity at last. âYon whitelipped child who wastes by slow degrees The heir of want and nurseling of disease He whose chilled infancy hath never known One accent kinder than the stranger's tone Matured untimely by the frost of grief Seared in his spring as autumn's stricken leafâ Read the mute question in his sunken eye That asks in terrorââtell meâmust I die?â And thereâdeserted in her hour of woeâ The death shade darkening o'er her cheek of snowâ (That cheek whose freshness was her fatal dower And lured the spoiler in its rosier hour) The wasted form and weary heart are laid Of one who lovedâand loving was betrayed. Fair as the roses that around her grew And bathed her tresses in their perfumed dew She sprung in beauty, and her native wild Smiled as in welcome o'er the lovely child. âAnd snows and summers passed oer hill and plain And rolling years renewed the golden grain On Anna's brow they left their ripening traceâ Changed mirth to calm and sprightliness to grace, But taught too little save the dangerous creed That conscious beauty learns too soon to read. âAnd who is he whose step is ever near, Whose low breathed accents meet the maiden's ear Who bends and smiles, and courts with flattering lies Melts in feigned tears and breathes in artful sighs Why change her features when his name is heard Why heaves her bosom at his lightest word Alas, she deems that faithless heart her ownâ She hears but love in every studied tone And wondering eyes remark her altered air And busy tongues their scanty hints compareâ A breathâa whisperâdoubtsâsuspicionâshameâ And shuddering virtue wept oer Anna's name! Dark are the paths her hurrying steps will share From shame to guilt, from anguish to despair Soon from her cheek shall fade its sullied bloom And every hope look forward to the tombâ That hour has comeâits sands are falling fast Forget her frailty for it is the last. âCan this be slumber? Yet its murmurs seem Like the wild visions of a troubled dreamâ âComeâcomeââshe whispersââI have waited longâ âIndeed I love thee though thou didst me wrongâ âThou dost not know meâI am pale and worn, âAnd those long tresses, once thy pride, are shornâ âNay, do not blame me, for the nights were cold âAnd we were starving, and they gave me goldâ âHe took the food and warmed him at the flame âAnd lisped his thanks to him I dared not name âThou neer hast seen himâlookâhow sweetly fair âO'er his white forehead waves his flaxen hair âCome to my armsâand art thou living still âI thought thee deadâthy little hand is chill âThou hast been slumbering where the night wind blew âAnd on thy ringlets shines the icy dew âOh God how heavy on my aching breast âWeighs thy cold cheekâI pray thee let me rest âThe shadows darken and the sun is gone âSleep, sleep, sweet angel till the day star's dawn âI too must slumberââYes to wake no more Thy dreams are ended and thy sorrows oer! Not ours to trace the endless shapes that rise As o'er the stage the living scenery flies A fertile subject is a dangerous thing A patent pump in sweet Castalia's spring That sucks and pours in one eternal stream And damns the poet with his drowning theme. O sovereign Patience! more than mortal power Whose smile can cheat each leaden footed hour Not winged like Hope, but rising calm and sure Strong to resist and faithful to endure, Spread thy mute influence o'er these wearied walls One little moment ere the curtain falls. If Sleep, thy sister, lend her drowsy charms And feebler heads nod heavy in her arms, Let Fancy cheat them with delicious dreams Of seraph minstrels and celestial themes,â HUNTING-SONG FOR 1839 NAUSHON Ye hunters of New England Who bear the rusty guns Your fathers shot the redcoats with, And left them to their sons! With all your firelocks blaze away Before the bucks are gone, As you aim at the game In the woods of old Naushon, Where the shot are flying right and left In the woods of old Naushon. Our sportsmen are proverbial Among the ducks and loons, And greatly feared of quadrupeds, From mammoths down to coons. With double barrels loaded high, Their triggers both are drawn, As they clang and they bang In the woods of old Naushon, Where the bucks are leaping through the leaves In the woods of old Naushon. New England's trusty sportsmen Shall leave their wives so dear, To hunt with our brave Governor For many a happy year. Then, then, ye gallant gentlemen, When ancient corks are drawn, Fill the toast to the host In the hall of old Naushon, While the wine is flowing bright and free In the hall of old Naushon. TO A. L. J. MARCH 6, 1840 One wordâand that so softly fell That Love alone could catch the sound, But all that virgin lips might tell Was in that little whisper found. The breath had melted on the airâ The form had passed, the smile had flown. I sought theeâbut thou wast not thereâ Yet, Dearest! I was not aloneâ Still side by side we seemed to stray Beneath those bleak and leafless trees Where balmy blossoms soon shall play Wreathed by the gentle April breezeâ Still side by side we wandered slow Unconscious through the busy throng And still in accents soft and low We murmured as we passed along. If He who bids the spring renew Her jewels like a blushing bride And sprinkles with the morning dew The moss upon the mountain's side Stoops from his azure throne above To paint the frail and thankless flowers O smiles he not on hope and love When first they bloom in hearts like ours? Darkness and silence! all around Dissolves the midnight's sable tideâ Yet still I tread on any ground With thee still trembling at my side. Comeâcome sweet shadowâroam no more. Is not this lonely house thy own! O let me dream the morning o'erâ Nay Dearest I am not alone. TO A. L. J. MAY 22, 1840 O Dearest, may each coming year More calm and cloudless shine Than this of mingling love and fear The first that calls thee mine! Still lightening like the morning beams Still spreading like the flowers May all yet locked in golden dreams Wake in the coming hours. In one deep tide our lives must flow O may they ever blend When bright with joy or dark with woe Unruffled to the end. TO A. L. J. MAY 30, 1840 When skims the summer moon on high Her starry train around her glowing When waves are bright and breezes sigh Through the dark foliage softly flowing Then like the voice that breathes around Shall be the gentle name thou bearest The first my trembling accents foundâ And thou shalt be Amelia, dearest. When to thy girlhood's simpler years With tranquil pulse thy heart is turning And she who watched thy smiles and tearsâ Her midnight lamp above thee burning Comes to thee as in days gone by Ere of her fondness death bereft theeâ Thou shalt be little Amelieâ The name her silent lips have left thee. When winter wears her snowy crest And dark the angry waves are swelling And love has made his peaceful nest Within our little quiet dwelling We will not heed the blustering storm Though all without is bleak and chilly But keep our fireside bright and warm And change Amelia into Milly. A SCINTILLA AT THE DINNER AFTER THE INAUGURATION OF JARED SPARKS HARVARD COLLEGE, JUNE 6, 1849 THE TASK Twelve well-crammed lines, firm, juicy, marrowy, sweet, No bone or trimmings, nothing here but meat, With rhyme run through them like a golden skewer. Taste might approve and patience may endure. THE EXECUTION Long live old Harvard! Lo, her rushing train Greets a new sign-board stretched across the plain, While the bell ringsâ(and that the bell shall do Till Charles shall drop his worn-out channel through,)â It gently hints to every cur that barks, Here comes the engine,âdon't you see the Sparks? How changed the scene! The forest path is clear; That mighty engine finds no Indian here! The world's great teachers quit their native Alps To fill the skulls once trembling for their scalps, When the red neighbors of our ancient school Let their own wigwams others' wigs to cool! A VISION OF LIFE SEPTEMBER 27, 1849 The well-known weakness of the rhyming race Is to be ready in and out of place; No bashful glow, no timid begging off, No sudden hoarseness, no discordant cough (Those coy excuses which your singers plead, When faintly uttering: âNo, I can't, indeedâ) Impedes your rhymster in his prompt career. Give him but hint; and won't the muse appear! So, without blushing, when they asked, I cameâ I whom the plough-share, not the quill, should claimâ The rural nymphs that on my labors smile May mend my fence, but cannot mend my style. The winged horse disdains my sober team, And teeming fancy must forget to dream. I harrow fields and not the hearts of men; Pigs, and not poems, claim my humble pen. And then to enter on so new a stage, With the fair critics of this captious age, Might lead a sceptic to the rude surmise That cits, turned rustics, are not otherwise; Or the bright verdure of the pastoral scene Had changed my hue, and made me very green. A few brief words that, fading as they fall, Like the frail garlands of a banquet hall, May lend one glow, one breath of fragrance pour, Ere swept ungathered from the silent floor. Such is my offering for your festal day: These sprigs of rhyme; this metrical bouquet. O my sweet sistersâlet me steal the name Nearest to love and most remote from blameâ How brief an hour of fellowship ensures The heart's best homage at a shrine like yours. As o'er your band our kindling glances fall, It seems a life-time since I've known you all! Yet on each face, where youthful graces blend, Our partial memory still revives a friend; The forms once loved, the features once adored, In her new picture nature has restored. Those golden ringlets, rippling as they flow, We wreathed with blossoms many years ago. Seasons have wasted; but remembered yet, There gleams the lily through those braids of jet. Cheeks that have faded, worn by slow decay, Have caught new blushes from the morning's ray. That simple ribbon, crossed upon the breast, Wakes a poor heart that sobbed itself to rest; Aye, thus she wore it; tell me not she died, With that fair phantom floating by my side. 'T is as of old: why ask the vision's name: All, to the white robe's folding, is the same; On that white bosom burns the self-same rose. Oh, dear illusion, how thy magic power Works with two charmsâa maiden and a flower! Then blame me not if, lost in memory's dream, I cheat your hopes of some expansive theme. When the pale starlight fills the evening dim, A misty mantle folds our river's brim. In those white wreaths, how oft the wanderer sees Half real shapes, the playthings of the breeze. While every image in the darkening tide Fades from its breast, unformed and undescried. Thus, while I stand among your starry train, My gathering fancies turn to mist again. O'er time's dark wave aerial shadows play, But all the living landscape melts away. WYCLIFFE The Avon to the Severn runs, The Severn to the sea; And Wycliffe's dust shall spread abroad, Wide as the waters be. LETTER TO THE GOVERNOR WILLIAM W. SWAIN Tell me, Dear Governor, what shall I do for you, How can you ask me to write something new for youâ I, who am working myself to an atomy Over my lectures in odious Anatomy? Surely your breast cannot hold such a stony part While I'm engaged on my Sketches of Bony part That you refuse to accept an apologyâ Guilt I confess, but I plead Osteology. What if I came; Why the pavement would fly at me. Bucks would start up and insist on a shy at me. Science suspending her habeas corpusses While I was shooting or looking at porpusses âBut there's a secret, Alas! that I'm splitting with; Guns do not suit me there's danger of killing with. Deer are such dears that I gladly would kiss 'em all, Treat 'em like ladiesâand thats why I Miss 'em all; Fishing is getting too rough for my feeling heart Though catching eels is a branch of the 'ealing art; Then as to feasting, it doesn't agree with me Each single goblet is equal to three with me Wine is my foe, though I still am a friend of itâ Hock becomes hic with a cup at the end of itâ And if I sit where the bumpers are bubbling, While I am looking each Cork seems a D(o)ublin! âFairest of Islands the birds ever light about Thine are the beauties for angels to write about; Kindest of hearts that a button e'er burst over Thine are the virtues that saints would cry first over! Blessings fall on you both, thick as the snow does, Till your last doe shall be do, with the dodos! PLEASURE REMEMBERED NAUSHON, NOVEMBER 19, 1850 Dear are our smiling pleasures while they last, But dearer sighs are wafted from the past. O'er the bright present with its arching bowers The vines, luxuriant, trail their fruit and flowers; In memory's vaults uncounted summers shine, Their purple clusters changed to beaming wine! Snatched from its stem, amidst the vulgar strife The grape may cool the fiery thirst of life, But the rich goblet that in peace we drain Turns to sweet visions in the dreaming brain. TO JULIA WARD HOWE JANUARY 1, 1854 If I were one, O Minstrel wild, That held âthe golden cupâ Not unto thee, Art's stolen child, My hand should yield it up; Why should I waste its gold on one That holds a guerdon brightâ A chalice, flashing in the sun Of perfect chrysolite. And shaped on such a swelling sphere As if some God has pressed Its flowing crystal, soft and clear On Hebe's virgin breast? What though the bitter grapes of earth Have mingled in its wine, The stolen fruits of heavenly birth Have made its hue divine. Oh, Lady, there are charms that win Their way to magic bowers, And they that weave them enter in In spite of mortal powers; And hearts that seek the chapel's floor Will throb the long aisle through, Though none are waiting at the door To sprinkle holy dew! I, sitting in the portal gray Of Art's cathedral dim, Can see thee, passing in to pray And sing thy first-born hymn;â Hold out thy hand! these scanty drops Come from a hallowed stream, Its sands, a poet's crumbling hopes, Its mist, his fading dream. Pass on. Around the inmost shrine A few faint tapers burn; This altar, priestess, shall be thine To light and watch in turn; Above it smiles the Mother Maid, It leans on Love and Art, And in its glowing depth is laid The first true woman's heart! LETTER TO THE CONNECTICUT STATE MEDICAL SOCIETY MARCH 23, 1855 If schoolboy memory does not serve me wrong, The God of Physic was the God of Song, Whence cunning slander on the lips of some, Declares his best prescription was a hum, Though modern skill disowns the pun, Medicine and Music still are one. Health to the great Musician! Him whose art Steals through the senses to the coldest heart. Not his to flourish on the pipe or lute, The horn, the fife, the flageolet, or flute; He blows no trumpet, draws no bow, nor sings; He only playsâthe âharp of thousand strings.â TO J. R. L.

FROM AN AFTER-DINNER SPEECH MASSACHUSETTS MEDICAL SOCIETY JUNE 27, 1855 As the river of New England That is flowing at our side, No rock can stay from running To meet the salt sea-tide; So roll our art's deep current By many a grateful shore, Till life has reached the ocean That pain shall vex no more. As the mountain of New England In the far off northern sky Looks down upon the river That wanders murmuring by, So from her cloud-capped turret Let solemn art look down On fashion's lying whisper And folly's idle frown. As the bright star of evening Plays on the mountain's crest, Glancing from every streamlet That sparkles on its breast; So let the heavenly splendors Of truth's white star be found Still shining fairest in us While all is dark around! CAMILLA AUGUST 9, 1855 The gray robe trailing round her feet, She smiled and took the slippered stirrup (A smile as sparkling, rosy, sweet, As soda, drawn with strawberry syrup);â Now, gallant, now! be strong and calm,â The graceful toilet is completed,â Her foot is in thy hollowed palmâ One little spring, and she is seated! No foot-print on the grass was seen, The clover hardly bent beneath her, I knew not if she pressed the green, Or floated over it in ether; Why, such an airy, fairy thing Should carry ballast in her pocket,â God bless me! If I help her spring She'll shoot up heavenward like a rocket. Ah, fatal doubt! The sleepless power That chains the orbs of light together, Bends on its stem the slenderest flower That lifts its plume from turf or heather; Clasp, lady, clasp the bridle rein! The filly standsâholds hard upon her! Twine fast those fingers in her mane, Or all is lostâexcepting honor! Earth stretched his arms to snatch his prize, The fairies shouted âStand from under!â The violets shut their purple eyes, The naked daisies stared in wonder: One moment.âSeated in her pride, Those arms shall try in vain to win her; âEarth claims her not,â the fairies cried, âShe has so little of it in her!â TWO POEMS FOR THE FESTIVAL OF ST. STEPHEN'S PARISH PITTSFIELD, AUGUST 9, 1855 I A DOLLAR'S WORTH MOTTO If man, or boy, or dolt, or scholar Will break this seal, he pays his dollar; But if he reads a single minute, He'll find a dollar's worth within it. LETTER Listen to me and I will try To tell you what a dollar will buy. A dollar will buy a Voter's conscience, Or a book of âFiftieth thousandâ nonsense; Or a ticket to hear a Prima Donna, Or a fractional part of a statesman's honor; It will buy a tree to sit in the shade of Or half the cotton a tournure's made of. It will buy a glass of rum or gin At a Deacon's store or a Temperance inn, (The Deacon will show you how to mix it Or the Temperance Landlord stay and fix it.) It will buy a painting at Burbank's hall That will frighten the spiders from off the wall; Or a dozen teaspoons of medium size, That will do for an Agricultural prize. It will buy four tickets to Barnum's showâ (Late firm of Pharaoh, Herod &amp; Co.) Or get you a paper that brings by mail Its weekly âOriginal thrilling taleââ Of which the essential striking plot Is a daddy that's rich and a youth that's not, Who seeking in vain for Papa's consent, Runs off with his daughterâthe poor old gent! The Governor's savage; at last relents And leaves them a million in cash and rents. Or a Hair-wash, patent, and warranted too, That will turn your whiskers from gray to blue, And dye old three score as good as new; So that your wife will open her eyes And treat you with coolness, and then surprise, And at last, as you're sidling up to her, Cry âI'll call my husband, you saucy cur!â Or a monochrome landscape, done in an hour, That looks like a ceiling stained in a shower; Or a ride to Lenox through mire and clay, Where you may see, through the live long day, Scores of women with couples of men Trudging up hillâand down again. This is what a dollar will do, With many things as strange but true; This very dollar I've got from youâ P. S. We shouldn't mind if you made it two. II FAITH MOTTO Faith is the conquering Angel's crown; Who hopes for grace must ask it; Look shrewdly ere you lay me down, I'm Portia's leaden casket. LETTER Fair lady, whosoe'er thou art, Turn this poor leaf with tenderest care, Andâhush, O hush thy beating heartâ The One thou lovest will be there! Alas! not loved by thee alone, Thine idol, ever prone to range; To-day, all thine, to-morrow flown, Frail thing that every hour may change. Yet, when that truant course is done, If thy lost wanderer reappear, Press to thy heart thy only One That nought can make more truly dear! POSTCRIPT Fair lady, lift thine eyes and tell If this is not a truthful letter; This is the one (1) thou lovest well, And nought (0) can make thee love it better (10). Though fickle, do not think it strange That such a friend is worth possessing, For one that gold can never change Is Heaven's own dearest earthly blessing. CRIMEA There is a weeping by England's hundred streams, By Severn, and Thames, and Trent; And o'er the graves of her trampled braves, The queen of the sea is bent. One lesson shall serve the haughty isle, Girt round with stately towers; Thank God that the blow which lays her low, Comes not from a hand of ours. INTRODUCTION FOR THE MEETING OF THE BURNS CLUB JANUARY 25, 1856 I have come with the rest, I can hardly tell why, With a line I will read you before it is dry. I know I've no business among you, full well, But I'm here, notwithstanding, and how, I will tell. It was not a billet beginning âDear Sir;â No missive like that would have coaxed me to stir; Nor a ticket, announcing the âonâ and the âat,â And ârequesting the honor,ââ'twas better than that. It was done by a visit, from one that you know, Whose smile is unchilled by life's season of snow, Whose voice is so winning, resist as you may, You must do what it says, for it will have its way. It is true that at first I began to suggest I should sit like a stranger apart from the rest; But he said: âTo no clan is our banquet confined, For the heart of the poet belongs to mankind.â Then I timidly asked, âCan I run, at a pinch, If our friends from the old world have learned how to lynch?â For I thought with dismay of the Know-Nothing Crew, And I fancied a yellââHe's a Know-Nothing too!â I thought of old Porteous, of Hare and of Burke; I remembered the witches of Alloway Kirk;â âWhy bless you,â he said with a smile, âif you're cotched, You will never be killed, you will only be Scotched!â So I came, and I'm here, with a line as I said; I don't mean the verses that just have been read, But the ones in my pocket, and so, if you please, You shall hear them at once if you'll pardon me these. FOR THE HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL I told him I wouldn'tâby George, and I meant it It's six o'clock now and too late to repent it,â Why need he come trying to wheedle and flatter me? Confound that Professor of morbid Anatomy! I swore that I would n'tâI cant commit perjuryâ âThere's a rap at my doorâthe Professor of Surgeryâ He'd like to know whether I shall not read somethingâ Why, haven't I sworn that I will be a dumb thing? âI am told,â he replies, âthere are strong expectations Of one of your rhyming tintinnabulations,ââ I don't care, says I, what they told you about itâ I myselfâon the highest authority,âdoubt it, It's a quarter past six, and its out of the questionâ It will just interrupt duodenal digestionâ For writing carotids and vertebrals taxes I want all my blood for my caliac axis. This stoning of frogs to the boy pretty sport is As the hill paddy said in articulo mortis, And its pleasant no doubt while one's filling his pharynx To call for a tune from another man's larynx. I told him I wouldn'tâI mean to stick to it In spite of J. B. S. J.âhe can't make me do itâ Goâbid your old skeletons open their throttles, Or stir up the babes in your alcohol bottles! No, no! you can't do it! don't think I'm half-witted Like alcohol babies whose brains were omitted! You don't suppose mine are beginning to soften? They would if I did as you'd have me so often. ââSo often! How often? No need we should tell you,â It is not the lips of the living compel youââ Ah no! from the shadows that hover around us I hear in the accents of friendship that bound us,â âCome now for the voice to which fondly we listened Some years before half these young fellows were christened It will cost you an hour, it will soothe us a minute Though nothing but love and good nature are in it.â Have I broken my oath like a traitor false-hearted? It was made to the living and the departed; I turn to the past from the bloom of the present That charming old lady is always so pleasant! But this is no place for the sage that remembers,â We want the bright flame, not the ashes and embers,â We ask but for smiles, not for tear drops to tickle,â Come, J. B. S. J. show a baby in pickle! AT A DINNER TO AGASSIZ MAY 28, 1857? The larches are green, and the lilacs have blown, And over the hillsides young summer has shone; So joyous, so glowing the welcome we bring,â As warm as our summer, as fresh as our spring! No breath from the glacier shall waft us its chill. Though Jung-frau remembers her vanquisher still; Our skies have an azure as deep as his own, And bright eyes have beamed for him, blue as the Rhone. We clasp him once more to the heart of the West; The rose of the Alps is for Liberty's breast. A home for his thought like the cloud-rending peak, His smile like the sunbeam that rests on its cheek! A SONG FOR THE WIDOW MASSACHUSETTS MEDICAL BENEVOLENT SOCIETY JULY 30, 1857 We drink to-night to eyes once bright, While Hope still told her story, That lost their gleam in the noontide beam, Like the blue of the morning-glory! CHORUS Then drink to-night to eyes once bright, While Heaven is bending o'er us To catch the song our lips prolong, And angels join our chorus. Let the sparkles pass o'er the brimming glass, With summer's life-blood glowing, As the fire-flies shine through the tangled vine Where the purple grapes are growing. CHORUS Though faint the spark that gilds our dark With love instead of learning, 'Tis the red that shows ere the rose-bud blows, Now its inmost heart is burning! CHORUS If wine can bring, from Mercy's spring, One drop for Sorrow's daughter, Why then 'tis clear, we need not fearâ Our wine has changed to water. CHORUS Then while we drink, the saints shall wink That stand as sentries o'er us, And the angels' eyes shall close likewise, Till they wake to join our chorus. SONG AT THE HUNT NAUSHON ISLAND SEPTEMBER 21, 1857 As o'er the goblets crystal brink The rosy blood is rushing Our lips must have a health to drink To save our cheeks from blushing We shall not pledge our young tonight If We've our wits about us Their blood is warm, their hearts are light They're well enough without us The old! what simpletons are they That leave their youth behind them? We drink their better senseâbut stay! We don't know where to find them. The ladies? shall our goblets ring For mothers wives &amp; daughters? Our hearts, without the âEagles Wingâ Have flown across the waters And as the river holds the skies With all their starry splendor Each cup is bright with beaming eyes As pure, as true, as tender. But look in silence on the wine For if the word were spoken The liquid mirror where they shine Would be forever broken So then for fear We die of thirst Before we lift the sluices We'll drink the health that mingles first, With summer's golden juices The Youth that holds his court today And spreads his household banner Long live the gallant, generous gay Lord of the Ocean Manor! Though like the Island where he reigns His frame by fate is anchored Love still runs laughing through the veins That rust has never cankered. And like the rock that breasts the sea Life's sunlit waves shall find him Till Heaven's soft whisper sets him free And Angel hands unbind him. THE HUNT NAUSHON, 1857 Not a buck was shot nor a doe nor a faun As from desire to dream they hurried, Though the huntsmen were dragged from their beds by dawn And the deer were terribly worried. They crawled back slowly at fall of night At a funeral trot returning, As they steered their course by the dim red light Where the Captain's cheroot was burning. Short, not sweet, were the words they said As they smoked in silent sorrow, But they swore that the deer must all be dead, And they'd try again tomorrow. No wish for a saddle or haunch was heard; They did not care a button, They said with a grin how they all preferred A leg of the island mutton. Little they spoke, as they jogged in the road But they kept up a mighty thinking Of the wagon showing its empty load, And the folks are staring and winking. They thought, as they sadly removed the caps From the useless shot and powder, How they'd better have staid at home, perhaps, And plied with their spoons at chowder. Slowly and solemnly, one by one, They entered and told their story, The hearing whereof brought lots of fun With a plentiful lack of gloryâ TO JAMES JACKSON, M. D. WITH A GIFT OF SILVER SALT-CELLARS This shrine a precious gift enfolds; Look, when its lids unclose, Not on the shining cross it holds, But on the love it shows. What though the silvered brow may seem Amid the youthful throng A little farther down the stream That bears us all along; Those murmuring waves are mute today, The stream forgets to run, The brown locks mingle with the gray, And all our hearts are one. Ah, could we bring earth's sweetest song And bear its brightest gold, The gift our grateful hearts would wrong, Our love were still untold. OUR SECOND SELVES Look with me through this magic glass, And see the people as they pass! As each in turn we bring in view, We thought him one, but find him two; A double shape, a twin-like pair, But one of flesh and one of air,â The first a vulgar mortal elf,â The second what he thinks himself! Our magic glass has curious tricks,â Yon slender youth of five feet six Struts like a peacock in the sun,â His second self is six feet one! And he with features all awry, Whose sweetest smile makes children cry, Walks not alone, but always near That lovely youth the âBelvidereâ! My lady's cheek can boast no more The cranberry white and pink it wore; And where her shining locks divide The parting line is all too wide,â (That fatal sign which still reveals The track of Time's remorseless wheels,â In short, if all the truth were told, She'sâHush! a lady's never old! We lift our glass; what youthful bride Walks blooming at my lady's side? Where'er she moves is always seen This sweet young figure, just eighteen, Fresh as Love's Goddess from the sea,â Who can this lovely image be? O, that's my lady, as she seems When waking, of herself she dreams! Give some poor lecturer leave to spout, And sit an hour to hear him out Look through our eye-glass at the chairâ Lo! Tully seated with him there! Nay spare the wretch that frozen sneer Or melt it with one pitying tear, When the lean, black-coat crow has cawed And wonders why they dont applaud. Shadow and substance; so we glide, Life's double spectres, side by side, Till o'er us peals the passing bell,â And which is real who can tell? God grant that in some happier sphere These flitting shapes may reappear Each fairer than its earthly dreams And be as to itself it seems! VARIATIONS ON AN ARIA HARVARD MUSICAL ASSOCIATION JANUARY 18, 1858 One molten cluster let me claim Of grapes that wore the purple stain,â No maddening draught of scorching flame But leaf and blossom-filtered rain, Sweet with the musky earth's perfume, Red with the burning glow of dawn, Still flower-like in its breath and bloom,â The soul of summers dead and gone! Ah, not alone their sunsets lie Dissolved in this empurpled glow, But sounds and shapes that will not die Run with its current's crimson flow! The music of the silent tongue,â The flying hands that swept the keys,â The broken lute, the harp unstrung,â We listen and we look for these. Hark! while the dimpling fount is stirred, The far off echoes move their wings, And through the quivering past is heard The murmur of its myriad strings. Once more that old remembered strain! The Prima Donna's locust-cry! And hush for memory breathes again Some lost âPierianâ melody! And so we will not call him thief Nor hold him guilty of a sin Who plucks away one ivy-leaf Or smoothes the panther's spotted skin; For if we steal the brightest wine We do the thyrsus little wrong, Since all the jewels of the vine Were thrown her by the God of Song! ADIEUX Ã LA VIE FROM THE FRENCH OF NICOLAS GILBERT At life's gay banquet placed, a poor unhappy guest, One day I pass then disappear; I die, and on the tomb where I at length shall rest No friend shall come to shed a tear. LES BOHÃMIENS FROM THE FRENCH OF BÃRANGER Wizards, jugglers, thieving crew,â Refuse drawn From the nations gone,â Wizards, jugglers, thieving crew, Merry Gipsies, whence come you? Whence we come? There's none may know. Swallows come, But where their home? Whence we come? There's none may know Who shall tell us where we go? From country, law and monarch free, Such a lot Who envies not? From country, law and monarch free Man is blest one day in three. Free-born babes we greet the day,â Church's rite Denied us quite,â Free-born babes we greet the day, To sound of fife and roundelay. Our young feet are unconfined Here below Where follies grow,â Our young feet are unconfined By swaddling bands of errors blind. Good people at whose cost we thieve In juggling book Will always look; Good people at whose cost we thieve In sorcerers and in saints believe. If Plutus meets our tramping band, Charity! We gaily cry; If Plutus meets our tramping band, We sing and hold him out our hand. Hapless birds whom God has blest Hunted down Through every town,â Hapless birds whom God has blest Deep in forests hangs our nest. Love, without his torch, at night Bids us meet In union sweet; Love, without his torch, at night, Binds us to his chariot's flight. Thine eye can never stir again, Learned sage Of slenderest gauge,â Thine eye can never stir again From thy old steeple's rusty vane. Seeing is having. Here we go! Life that's free Is ecstasy. Seeing is having. Here we go! Who sees all, conquers all below. But still in every place they cry, Join the strife Or lag through life; But still in every place they cry, âThou'rt born, good-day; thou diest, good-bye.â When we die, both young and old, Great and small, God save us all! When we die, both young and old, To the doctors all are sold. We are neither rich nor proud; Laws we scorn For freedom born; We are neither rich nor proud,â Have no cradle, roof or shroud. But, trust us, we are merry still; Lord or priest Greatest or least: But, trust us, we are merry still; 'Tis happiness to have our will. Yes, trust us, we are merry still Lord or priest Greatest or least Yes, trust us, we are merry still: 'Tis happiness to have our will. ANSWER TO A TEETOTALER Who was it, I pray, On the wedding day Of the Galilean's daughter With a touch divine Turned into wine Six buckets of filtered water?

When you extract A polyp or a wen, Why are you drest in all your best, Among these plain young men? O Professor! Professor, can't you tell? Why when you take a tumour out You needs must cut a swell! IV Professor Bougie, stand aside, We cannot let you in. Professor Squills, Professor Pills, With you we will begin.

Drench me with teacups of Souchong Redder than garnets, upas-strong,â Drug me with coffee, make me drain Huge bowls of Hyson, Slumber's bane, Too happy for my pardon's sake To lie till morning, wide awake. By all the firefly sparks that fill The twilight groves of Shady hill,â (Faint emblems of the gleams that flit And sparkle through a woman's wit,) By every smile on woman's face,â By all that makes my Cousin Grace,â By every Nymph of cakes and tea If I said waspâI meant a bee. Alas! we have been friends so long But tongues are sharp, and tea is strong And words are sudden, and minds are weak, And to be thoughtless when we speak Is to be human.â Chase away This silly stinging âwaspâ, I pray, And on the next Triennial see If you are not declared A. B. TO E. AND L. A. WITH A PEAR The Prophet for his thirsting flock Bade streams of water flow; The new enchanter smites the rock And fruits of Eden glow. Like goes to like; this beauty seeks The great and good and fair, And finds at length, with blushing cheeks, A second matchless pair. A LETTER TO ELIZA If any other son of Adam Owns my whole name, respected Madam, Except one boy, who's now in college, It's quite beyond my sphere of knowledge.

And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave While the land of the free is the home of the brave. TRUMPET SONG The battle-drum's loud rattle is rending the air, The troopers all are mounted, their sabres are bare: The guns are unlimbered, the bayonets shine, Hark! hark! 'tis the trumpet-call! wheel into line! Ta ra! ta ta ta! Trum trum, tra ra ra ra! Beat drums, and blow trumpets! Hurrah, boys, hurrah! March onward, soldiers, onward, the strife is begun, Loud bellowing rolls the boom of the black-throated gun; The rifles are cracking, the torn banners toss, The sabres are clashing, the bayonets cross! Ta ra! ta ta ta!, etc. Down with the leaguing liars, the traitors to their trust, Who trampled the fair charter of Freedom in dust! They falter, they waver, they scatter, they run, The field is our own, and the battle is won! Ta ra! ta ta ta!, etc. God save our mighty people, and prosper our cause! We're fighting for our nation, our land, and our laws! Though tyrants may hate us, their threats we defy, And drum-beat and trumpet shall peal our reply!

SONG OF WELCOME TO THE RUSSIAN FLEET JUNE 8, 1864 Sea-birds of Muscovy, rest in our waters, Fold your white wings by our rock-girded shore; While with glad voices its sons and its daughters Welcome the friends ye have wafted us o'er. Sea-kings of Neva, our hearts throb your greeting! Deep as the anchors your frigates let fall; Down to the fount where our life-pulse is beating, Sink the kind accents you bear to us all. Fires of the North, in eternal communion, Blend your broad flashes with evening's bright star! God bless the Empire that loves the great Union! Strength to her people! Long life to the Czar! AN OLD GRADUATE'S VERSES PHI BETA KAPPA DINNER, HARVARD JULY 21, 1864 A peaceful haven while the deep is seething, An alcove's cobwebs while the flags are flaunting, A spot of tranquil shade for quiet breathing While all the haggard, hurried world is panting; Hard by, a church-yard full of soundest sleepers, Old square-browed Presidents with wisdom brimming, Long âdeadedâ tutors and clean swept up sweepers, And the slim youths of promise, drowned in swimming; Old trees, the saplings of the Revolution, That heard the banging of the âLively'sâ cannon,â The first salute that hailed the âConstitution,ââ The broadsides of the âChesapeakeâ and âShannonâ; Old halls, each building youth's eternal palace, Stirring and sparkling still with fresh newcomers, As the last vintage fills the same old chalice That held the life-blood of a hundred summers; Old teachers, abstracts of the mouldy centuries, Sines, xs, accents, etched on all their features, Old beldames slopping through the windy entries With pail and besom,âobsoletest creatures! Old legends of our fathers' fathers' follies, Born of hot youth and blood-inflaming revel,â The midnight leap from Harvard's roof to Hollis,â The sinful words that summoned up the Devil; Prayer bellsâbrief toiletsâlimited lavationâ Sharp run of tardy saints to Pater noster, Where worship mingles with the contemplation Of doubtful record on the morning's roster; The long, long grind of daily recitation Chalk, blackboard, âpony,â prompter, all in action The prisoned hour of stifling condensation, The final gush, rush, flush of rarefaction. These are the old, old tangled recollections That Time in strange confusion blends and mingles Till with the wakened thrill of young affections The marrow in the bones of Memory tingles! These weave the dream, the beatific vision That haunts our busy day, our toil-bought slumbers, Here are the blissful shades, the bowers Elysian, And these the brightest hours our evening numbers! PRELUDE NAUSHON ISLAND, NOVEMBER 1864 O thou who lovest best the song Of bird that never sang in cage, Such as the wood-notes that belong To this, our Island Song-book's page! O'er its fair field the fancy flits That never bounden book confined, And on its perch the warbler sits Whom leaden chains could never bind. As when the birds in copse and glen, From oaken bough and beechen spray,â Thrush, robin, sparrow, bobolink, wren, Blackbird and bluebird, finch and jay,â With joyous clamor wake the morn And startle all the leafy woods, So thrill those poet-voices, born In Nature's sea-girt solitudes! Ah, happy seasons, lapsing sweet Amid those bowers of peace and rest, Where all the songsters loved to meet And carol round the king-bird's nest, Your flowers are dust, your suns have set, Yet here they still shall bloom and shine, Till Love and Friendship both forget They knelt before the Island shrine! THE JUBILEE Nauticus loquitur I've heerd some talk of a Jubilee To celebrate âourâ âvictoryâ;â Now I'm a chap as follers the sea, ânâ f'r 'z I know, nob'dy'll listen t'me, B't I'll tell y' jest what's my idee. When you ânâ a felalh 'z got your grip, Before y've settled it which can whip, I won't say nothin'. You let her rip! Knock him to splinters, chip by chip! I tell y', shipmates ânâ lan'sm'n too, There's chaps aboard th't's 'z good 'z you,â 'Twas God A'mighty that made her crew! FOLKS is FOLKS! ânâ that's 'z true 'z that land is black ânâ water blue! Come tell us, shipmates, ef y' can, Was there ever a crew sence th' worl' began That sech a wallopin' had to stan' 'z them poor fellahs th't tried t' man The great Chicago catamaran? Wahl, this is what y've had t' do,â T' lick 'em,âbut not t' drown 'em too! There's some good fellahs, ânâ not a few That's a swimmin' about, all chilled ânâ blue, ânâ wants t' be h'isted aboard o' you! Come, drowning foes! your friends we'll be,â We've licked! Haw! haw! You're licked! Hee! hee! Hooraw for you! Horraw for we! We'll wait till the whole wide land is free, And then we'll have our JUBILEE! TO JOHN PIERPONT APRIL 6, 1865 Love, honour, reverence are the meed we owe To him who in the press of younger men, Toiling with head, heart, hand, with tongue and pen, Treads his firm pathway through the blinding snow, Singing in cheery tones that long ago Our fathers heard: Not less melodious, when Ten winters lie on three score years and ten, And still life's unchilled fountains overflow! Though paler seems the faithful watch tower's light In the rich dawn that kindles all the day, Still in our grateful memory lives the ray Of the lone flambeau, blazing through the night Now while the heavens, in new-born splendours bright Shine o'er a ransomed people's opening way. TO THE HARVARD ASSOCIATION OF NEW YORK CITY FEBRUARY 20, 1866 She to whose faithful breast each child is dear Hears the far murmur of your voices meeting,â Ah sweetest music to her loving ear! And sends a mother's greeting. When first enrobed her radiant form she dressed TRUTH was the pearl that on her forehead glistened,â FREEDOM her message to the virgin West, And the whole world has listened. Whate'er she gave you,âlearning, science, art,â Shed from the mystic tree whose leaves are letters, One gift excelled them allâa manly heart Freed from all earthly fetters. Guard well the pearl of Harvard, all too white For the coarse hands to clutch that buy and barter,â Conquer with Freedom in her life-long fight Or fall her noble martyr! FOR A MONUMENT I Insensibility to pain During a surgical operation First produced at the Mass. General Hospital In Boston By the use of Sulphuric Ether in October 1846 To commemorate this event A citizen of Boston Has caused this monument to be erected A.D. 1866 II These dews of mercy Heaven in pity shed To lap in peaceful dreams the sufferer's head, To calm the lingering throb of mortal strife, And smooth the path that leads from life to life. III God wrought the marvel of our Mother's birth While Adam slumbered, painless, on the earth; Her living daughters bless the gracious power That soothes the pang of woman's sorrowing hour. IV Too cold the stone, the shaping hand too rude Though only mortals asked our gratitude, Thy glories, Father, in Thy servants shine,â For all our blessings all the praise be Thine! FOR LONGFELLOW'S BIRTHDAY FEBRUARY 27, 1867 In gentle bosoms tried and true How oft the thought will be, âDear friend, shall I remember you, Or you remember me?â But thou, sweet singer of the West, Whose song in every zone Has soothed some aching grief to rest And made some heart thine own, Whene'er thy tranquil sun descends,â Far, far that evening be,â What mortal tongue may count the friends That shall remember thee? ON RECEIVING A STOLEN APPLE We owe, alas! to woman's sin The woes with which we grapple;â To think that all our plagues came in For one poor stolen apple! And still we love the darling thief Whose rosy fingers stole it;â Her weakness brought the world to grief, Her smiles alone console it! âI take the âstolenâ fruit you leave,â (Forgive me, Maid and Madam,) It makes me dream that you are Eve, And wish that I were Adam! A WREATH OF FLOWERS This wreath of flowers that bids thee wait A moment at the trellised gate Shall lure thee to enchanted ground Where all the singing birds are found, Where flows the fount that never fails,â The Garden of the Nightingales! âBehold the slender star that lifts The fringe of Winter's narrowing drifts; The violet that with open wings Lights where the first-born verdure springs; The bell-wort, swinging in the breeze As if to call the wandering bees To taste the honeyed lymph that shines Globed in the clustering columbines. âThese heaven-kissed darlings never know How sweet their breath, how bright their glow They win the charm they never seek, The perfume and the painted cheek, Feel in their veins the morning's flame Nor ask the sunbeam whence it came. âTraced in the blossom's silken fold Is not the Poet's story told? Then grudge not to his flowering lays The humble violet's meed of praise For beauty, Nature's sweet surprise Must read itself in other's eyes, And till the welcome echoes ring The song-birds hardly know they sing. CATULLUS: DE ARRIO, LXXXII Arrius says chommoda for commoda; Hinsidias for insidias he must say. Counting his language wonderful polite He says hinsidias with all his might. Just so, I think, his mother used to do, His uncle, grandsire and his grandam too. At length, to Syria sent, our Arrius goes And so our ears obtain a brief repose; Soft, smooth once more becomes each self-same word, When all at once the horrid tale is heard Ionia's wave, since Arrius came must be, No more the Ionian, but the Hionian Sea! THE RELUCTANT MINSTREL My Lord the King,âthe minstrel swore I sing at banquet board no more Not for the stranger from afarâ No! were it Emperor, King or Czar Or my Lord the Bishop of Zanzibar! Will I straighten leg on feasting floor! For who would waste laborious days And toilsome nights on idle lays That win some little word of praise Pleasing or clever, neat, or nice, Brief as the candelabrum's blaze And shrivel with the dead bouquets? Tonight too cheap at any price, Tomorrow like the fair device The artist shaped in sugared ice, The frozen Cupid's melting kissâ âAn immortality like this I hold it rather gain to miss. And so the Singer would not sing But stood before My Lord the King Mute as a lyre without a string! Great Captains came from over sea Ladies and Lords of high degree But never a song for them had he! A mighty gathering there was seen Came many a king and many a queen With little princes packed betweenâ All Europe's monarchs to a man The Great Mikado from Japan Likewise the Shah from Teheran. Well known the Singer was to these To hear him they had crossed the seas; They knelt upon their royal knees;â âO sing now, Minstrel, sing now, please! And you shall claim what boon you wishâ The bard stood silent as a fish. The King of England then laid down A diamond plucked from off his crown âWould pay the ransom of a town,â âTake this, he said, and fill your purse, But Oh! for Heaven's sweet sake, rehearse Some stanzas of your charming verse.â The Sultan would not be outdone The Emperor, Brother of the Sun Khedives and Caliphs, every one The Shah, the Czar and all the rest From North and South and East and West Threw down the gems they loved the best. For who would waste laborious days And toilsome nights on idle lays That win some little word of praise As âpleasing,â âcleverâ âneatâ or âniceâ Then shrivel with the dead bouquets? Tonight too cheap at any price Tomorrow like the fair device The artist shaped in sugared iceâ To vanish while the candles blaze! The doves that cooed in frosty blissâ Cupid with frozen bow and quiver (A little boy whose melting kiss Would make a Lapland lover shiverâ) I hold it rather gain to miss An immortality like this! And so the Singer would not sing, But stood before my Lord the King Mute as a lyre without a string Great Captains came from over sea Ladies and Lords of high degreeâ But never a song for them had he. WIND-CLOUDS AND STAR-DRIFTS ADDITIONAL LINES âThey had their choice, you say, their will was free, And nothing hindered each and every one From thinking always as he should have thought From doing always as he should have done. So had he found the right and saved his soul Look you, this choosing seems a simple thing But could we always choose as we would choose, When nothing seems to bind us in our choice What painters, sculptors, poets, we might be! âLay me those flakes of color thus and soâ Here are the brush and palette,âyou are freeâ Make me a picture such as Raphael drew! Here are the block and chisel, you may work Just as you will with them,âchoose well your strokes, You'll find the Queen of beauty in the stone! Spread open on your desk the ample page That holds the treasures of our English tongue; You have your choice of each and every word; And you are free to place them as you will; Write me a play like Hamlet, or a song Like his who sang of Eden and its woe! Lend me your patience O ye solemn stars THE TOOTHACHE How well I remember through years that have gone The hour when the first of my molars was drawn! I often have sung of the day-dreams of youth, But oh! its dread nightmare,âthat pulling a tooth! It had ached all the day, it had ached all the night As morning came on it redoubled its spite It jumped like a bull-frogâit beat like a drum Till I shrieked âI can stand it no longerâI vum!â So I sprang from my bed with a series of howls One eye sticking out of my head like an owl's The other poor optic was closed as in sleep,â In fact my poor peeper was tight as a peep Then rushed the whole household to answer my call Aunts sisters and mammy and granny and all With plasters and lotions and potions and drops And camphor and cajeput, laudanum and hops. So they drugged and they doctored and bandaged my cheek (Still out of one corner I managed to speak;) âHave the camphor and cajeput made it all well?â No! It aches likeâa word I prefer not to tell Alas there was nothing could solace my pain. Hops camphor and cajeput all were in vain, But they kept at it stoutly with more of the sameâ And so things went on till the Governor came. âLet me see it!â he said: then all quaking with fear I just opened my mouthâit was under my earâ He gave but one lookâAh ha! there's no doubt We must go to the doctor's it's got to come out! So we started at onceâas we got to the door âPapa! I exclaimed, it is aching no more Let us not waste our money, but go to the shop That's next to the doctors and purchase a top. Done aching! the Governor says with a grinâ A rogue in the halter repents of his sin That grinder's a humbugâit can't tell the truth When its scared there is nothing will lie like a tooth. Then he rappedâAnd we hadn't a second to wait For a doctor's a fish and a patient's the bait, And before I knew what I was doing and where, I was seatedâmy head on the back of the chair. How I wished he was dead or I'd never been born As he poked in my mouth with his finger of horn! And he fumbled and the next thing I saw Was a damnable tool with a horrible claw! The next I remember was âStop! Let me go!â And a yell as of murder committing,âOh! Oh! For I thought he was pulling my head by the roots And its fangs were clenched under the soles of my boots. That wrench of the key! I remember it yet 'Tis a moment it takes a whole life to forget; The swelling soon went, but a terrible while Elapsed ere my cheek was relaxed in a smile. The moral sticks out like a pawnbroker's sign, It projects from my verse like an upper canine; There is something to say for the pleasures of youth But its terrible drawback is drawing a tooth! And thus I concludeâfor my story is toldâ It is good to be young, but it's best to be old For we're curst with twelve molars that all must be drawn And we never have peace till the-last of them's gone. CHARADE My name declares my date to be The morning of a Christian year, Though motherless, as all agree, I am a mother, it is clear, A father too, without dispute, And when my son comes,âhe's a fruit. And not to puzzle you too much, 'T was I gave Holland to the Dutch. IN T. G. A.'S ALBUM FEBRUARY 22, 1874 Who that can pluck the flower will choose the weed, Leave the sweet rose and gather blooms less fair? And who my homely verse will stay to read Straying enchanted through this bright parterre When morning's herald lifts his purple bell And spring's young violet woos the wanderer's eye? Nay! let me seek the fallen leaves that tell Of beggared winter's footstep drawing nigh There shall my shred of song enshrouded lie, A leaf that dropped in memory's flowery dell; The breath of friendship stirred it and it fell Tinged with the loving hue of autumn's fond farewell! TELEGRAM TO THE BOHEMIAN CLUB: SAN FRANCISCO MIDNIGHT, FEBRUARY 28, 1874 Message from San Francisco! Whisper low, Asleep in bed an hour or so ago, While on his peaceful pillow he declines, Say to his friend who sent these loving lines: âSilent, unanswering, still to friendship true, He smiles in slumber, for he dreams of you.â CHARADE 1876 Parted! Alas, it brings my first to mind; My second doubles every tear that's shed; My whole why task your laboring brain to find Since being what it is 'twere best unsaid. Parted the rip brings needles to my mind; S makes tear tears, so doubles each that's shed; Needless, my whole, why task your brain to find Since, being needless, it were best unsaid? A RHYMED RIDDLE FEBRUARY 14, 1876 âI'm going to blank,â with failing breath, The fallen gladiator said; Unconquered, he âconsents to death;â One gaspâthe hero soul has fled. âI'm going to blank,â the school-boy cried; Two sugared sweets his hands display,â Like snow-flakes in the ocean-tide They vanish, melted both away. Tell with one verb, or I'll tell you, What each was just about to do. âOVER THE RIVERâ A NEW VERSION, WITH INSTRUMENTAL ACCOMPANIMENT The ungloved fingers of dainty Spring Are peeping from tree and shrub; I see the flash of the blue-bird's wing, Their welcome carol the robin's sing. I hear theirârub a dub rub dub rub Rub a dub dub dub DUB! Ha! What is the sound that smites mine ear? Rub a dub rub dub dub!

MY EXCUSE FOR NOT WRITING JUNE 9, 1876 You ask me to write you some verses! Not I While the Crab and the Lion are lords of the skyâ Nay, wait till the Virgin gives place to the Scales And the first leaves of autumn are swept by the gales. If you'll give me a spade in the earth I will delve If you'll lend me a hatchet I'll clutch at its helve If you'll find me a knife there are branches to prune But a pen makes me shudderâa goose-quill in June! I have laid all my papers and books on the shelf Why scribble while nature is writing herself Each grass-blade a letter that sparkles with dew And flowers for her capitals, gold red and blue? I can read all day long from those pages of green Whose characters lay through the winter unseen Till out at the summons of sunshine they came Like the words of a love-letter held to the flame But to write in dead phrases! the roses have blown Shall I sprinkle their damask with Eau de Cologne? Shall I mock the sweet season of blossoming bowers With a milliner's nosegay of calico flowers? While the spice of the sassafras clings to my lips While the axe I have chopped with smells sweet of the chips While the turtles lie basking on fence rails and logs While the meadows resound with the chorus of frogs While the lily-pad greenbacks their promise display Of the silver and gold that the lilies will pay, While heavy the nest of the oriole swings While Nature's gay buffo, the bobolink sings Excuse me, dear friend; in your quest after verse You may have gone fartherâyou can't have fared worse. I send you my blessing, 'tis all that I canâ In the lazy, limp month of the flowers and the fan. TO J. R. N. SEPTEMBER 22, 1876 See what the artist's hand could do To clothe these winged words! So Nature lends each loveliest hue To deck her darling birds. Why turn the leaves for aught beside Your pleasure to prolong? 'Tis not the brightest plumes that hide The throats of sweetest song. TO J. R. L. JULY 14, 1877 Good bye! Good bye! We cannot mend The homely Saxon phrase. May God be with you, parting friend We love too well to praise. We lose you as we lose the light On yonder steep that burns; For us on shore awhile tis bright Then to the wave it turns. What though we miss the lofty blaze Our eyes have learned to hail,â More welcome still its widening rays To many a wandering sail. So, though we miss your light awhile, We will not vainly sigh, But falter with a sorrowing smile Dear friend Good bye! Good bye! THE GOLDEN CALENDAR TO J. G. W. Count not the years that hoarding Time has told, Save by the starry memories in their train; Not by the vacant moons that wax and wane, Nor all the season's changing robes enfold: Look on the life whose record is unrolled! Bid thought, word, action, breathe, burn, strive again, Bid the freed captive clank his broken chain! Old altars flame whose ashes scarce are cold, So will we count thy years and months and days, Poet whose heart-strings thrill upon thy lyre, Whose kindling spirit lent like Hecla's fire Its heat to Freedom's faint auroral blaze, But waste no words the loving soul to tire That finds its life in duty, not in praise! MAY IT PLEASE YOUR HONORS' WORSHIPS FOR THE SUFFOLK BAR ASSOCIATION JANUARY 8, 1879 May it please your Honors' Worships, since I'm on the witness stand, I will speak the truthâSo help me! See, I'm holding up my hand! I'm a Doctor, not a Lawyer,âI'm aware it's very queer, And the Court has asked the question How a Doctor came in here. Now I hope you will believe him; he will try to be exactâ How he came here is the question, for he can't deny the fact; Every minute he's been listening for a general scream and shout Here's a wolf among the lambkinsâthrow him over! turn him out! Don't be scared! He can't do mischief, even were he so inclined, For he comes without his weaponsâhe has left them all behindâ His decoctions, his infusions, all his plasters, all his pills, All his lotions, all his potions, all his vaccinating quills. It's himself that shakes and shivers, as full well indeed he may, When he sees the Law all round him in its terrible array, With its warrants, its indictments, its presentments and its writs, And its sheriffs and its constables that scare folks into fits. How he came here is the question; he had said so once before, But the Law loves repetition up to twenty times or more; 'Tis the question How he came here, or to make it still more plain, Here he came and How's the question; thus he states the case again. He was brought in on a capias, he would have you understand, And the mandate is no exeat until he shows his hand So he opens it before you; keep your places! pray be calm! 'Tis a strange sight for you lawyers; there is nothing in its palm! There may have been some blunder, such as magistrates will make, It may need a writ of error, if we find there's a mistake, But the jurists and the medicine-men their phrases so have fixed That there is some little reason why their callings should get mixed. Take an action of ejectmentâ'tis the commonest of thingsâ In a case of over-feeding just that same your doctor brings, And the lawyer, vice versa, in the courts of ancient time Wrote prescriptions for his clients how to purge themselvesâof crime. How many learned counsellors, with Digests on their shelves, Go complaining to their doctors that they can't digest, themselves! When you talk of Magna Charta, I should like to ask of you What without their Habeas corpus poor anatomists would do? But my scroll is growing, lengthening, and you're asking for relief From a paper that resembled what a lawyer calls his brief, And of all the calm assumptions the coolest one by far Were to say âI do the talking for the deaf-mutes of the Bar.â What's a Doctor's or Professor's to a jury-lawyer's tongue? 'Tis a pitch-pipe to a fog-horn; tis a spigot to a bung; Says a Doctor to a patient âRun your tongue out to the roots;â To a jury-lawyer never, for it reaches to his boots! I am honest, though I say so; I am modest, that is clear; Do you ask to know the reason; Well, I studied Law a year. So I've said my say, Your Honor, and you gentry of the Laws, And await my jury's verdict.âPlease to call another cause. THE ALBUM FIEND APRIL 6, 1880 âOne verse,â she says,ââfour glittering linesâ A solitaire,âjust one.ââ 'Tis finished; every facet shines A star that mocks the sun. âOne earring! that were frightful, sure,â What Muse would wear but one, Were that the blazing Koh-i-noor? One more, since you've begun!â So, once again, with weary sighâ 'Twere vain my fate to shunâ I rack my brain and roll my eye; My album task is done! Done! when those daughters fill their sieve, When rivers cease to run, When imps turn angels, then believe Your album task is done! ALMA MATER HARVARD CLUB, NEW YORK, FEBRUARY 21, 1882 Yes, home is sweet! and yet we needs must sigh, Restless until our longing souls have found Some realm beyond the fireside's narrow bound Where slippered ease and sleepy comfort lie,â Some fair ideal form that cannot die By age dismantled and by change uncrowned, Else life creeps circling in the self-same round, And the low ceiling hides the lofty sky. Ah, then to thee our truant hearts return, Dear Mother, Alma, Castaâspotless, kind! Thy sacred walls a larger home we find, And still for thee thy wandering children yearn, While with undying fires thine altars burn Where all our holiest memories rest enshrined. AT THE UNITARIAN FESTIVAL JUNE 1, 1882 The waves unbuild the wasting shore; Where mountains towered the billows sweep, Yet still their borrowed spoils restore And raise new empires from the deep. So, while the floods of thought lay waste The old domain of chartered creeds, Its heaven-appointed tides will haste To shape new homes for human needs. Be ours to mark with hearts unchilled The change an outworn age deplores; The legend sinks, but Faith shall build A fairer throne on new-found shores. The star shall glow in Western skies That shone o'er Bethlehem's hallowed shrine, And once again the temple rise That crowned the rock of Palestine. Not when the wondering shepherds bowed Did angels sing their latest song, Nor yet to Israel's kneeling crowd Did heaven's sacred dome belong,â Let priest and prophet have their dues, The Levite counts but half a man, Whose proud âsalvation of the Jewsâ Shuts out the good Samaritan! Though scattered far the flock may stray, His own the shepherd still shall claim,â The saints who never learned to pray,â The friends who never spoke his name. Dear Master, while we hear thy voice That says, âThe truth shall make you free,â Thy servants still by loving choice, Oh, keep us faithful unto thee! RESPONSE TO A TOAST BOSTON BAR ASSOCIATION JANUARY 30, 1883 His Honor's father yet remains His proud paternal posture firm in; But, while his right he still maintains To wield the household rod and reins, He bows before the filial ermine. What curious tales has life in store, With all its must-be's and its may-be's! The sage of eighty years and more Once crept a nursling, on the floor,â Kings, conquerors, judges,âall were babies. The fearless soldier, who has faced The serried bayonet's gleam appalling, For nothing save a pin misplaced The peaceful nursery has disgraced With hours of unheroic bawling. The mighty monarch, whose renown Fills up the stately page historic, Has howled and wakened half the town, And finished off by gulping down His castor-oil or paregoric. The justice, who, in gown and cap, Condemns a wretch to strangulation, Has scratched his nurse and spilled his pap And sprawled across his mother's lap For wholesome law's administration. Ah, life has many a reef to shun Before in port we drop our anchor, But when its course is proudly run, Look aft! for there the work was done. Life owes its headway to the spanker! Yon seat of Justice well might awe The fairest manhood's half-blown summer,â There Parsons scourged the laggard law, There reigned and ruled majestic Shaw,â What ghosts to hail the last new-comer! One cause of fear I faintly name,â The dread lest duty's dereliction Shall give so rarely cause for blame Our guileless voters will exclaim, âNo need of human jurisdiction!â What keeps the doctor's trade alive? Bad air, bad water,âmore's the pity! But lawyers walk where doctors drive, And starve in streets where surgeons thrive Our Boston is so pure a city. What call for judge or court, indeed, When righteousness prevails so through it? Our virtuous car conductors need Only a card whereon they read âDo right! It's naughty not to do it!â The whirligig of time goes round And changes all things but affection; One blessed comfort may be found In Heaven's broad statute, which has bound Each household to its head's protection. If e'er aggrieved, attacked, accused, A sire may claim a son's devotion To shield his innocence abused, As old Anchises freely used His offspring's legs for locomotion. You smile. You did not come to weep, Nor I my weakness to be showing; And these gay stanzas, slight and cheap, Have served their simple useâto keep A father's eyes from overflowing. DOROTHY QUINCY UPHAM JUNE 7, 1883 Dear little Dorothy, Dorothy Q., What can I find to write to you? You have two U's in your name, it's true, And mine is adorned with a double-u; But there's this difference in the U's, That one you will stand a chance to lose When a happy man of the bearded sex Shall make it Dorothy Q. ? X. May Heaven smile bright on the blissful day That teaches this lesson in Algebra! When the orange blossoms crown your head, Then read what your old great-uncle said, And remember how in your baby-time He scribbled a scrap of idle rhyme,â Idle, it may beâbut kindly, too, For the little lady, Dorothy Q. TO J. R. L. HOMEWARD BOUND JUNE 15, 1885 [Brave Bird o' fredum] what a sight it were To see thee in our waters yet appeare [After] those flights upon the banks of Thames That so did take [all England with] our James. Ben Jonson in memory of Shakespeare. Adapted by O. W. H. TO MARK TWAIN ON HIS FIFTIETH BIRTHDAY NOVEMBER 23, 1885 Ah Clemens, when I saw thee last,â We both of us were younger,â How fondly mumbling o'er the past Is Memory's toothless hunger! So fifty years have fled, they say, Since first you took to drinking,â I mean in Nature's milky way,â Of course no ill I'm thinking. But while on life's uneven road Your track you've been pursuing, What fountains from your wit have flowedâ What drinks you have been brewing! I know whence all your magic came,â Your secret I've discovered,â The source that fed your inward flameâ The dreams that round you hovered: Before you learned to bite or munch Still kicking in your cradle, The Muses mixed a bowl of punch And Hebe seized the ladle. Dear babe, whose fiftieth year to-day Your ripe half-century rounded, Your books the precious draught betray The laughing Nine compounded. So mixed the sweet, the sharp, the strong, Each finds its faults amended, The virtues that to each belong In happier union blended. And what the flavor can surpass Of sugar, spirit, lemons? So while one health fills every glass Mark Twain for Baby Clemens! TO YOUTHFUL RHYMESTERS So youthful rhymesters when a poet sings Feel at their shoulders for the envied wings Flap their bare arms, cry âcanâ and wonder why They like the song birds cannot sing and fly. Beware, young dreamer! he that hopes to climb To fame and fortune up the stairs of rhyme Too oft will find his weary feet have found A creaking treadmill travelling round and round While on its path the world of action goes And leaves its prizes with the men of prose. Ill is the bough that yields the laurel wreathâ Its drip is poison to the herbs beneathâ And many an idle youth and bitter maid Have seen their virtues languish in its shade Though vain the task their fated course to stem This bitter lesson I commend to them: Who writes in verse that should have writ in prose Is like a traveller walking on his toes,â Happy the rhymester who in time has found The heels he lifts were made to touch the ground. FOR MISS HOWELLS' ALBUM APRIL 24, 1887 It is winter with me now,â Not a pippin on the bough Save a single âfroze-n-thawâ; Spread your lap and it shall fall,â It's an apple after all, Though it's neither roast nor raw. So my verse its life has lost In its battles with the frost And I fear the branch will break While the leafless tree I climb For this âfroze-n-thawâ of rhyme For a dear young maiden's sake. TO THE REVEREND S. F. SMITH, D. D. AUTHOR OF âMY COUNTRY 'TIS OF THEE,â ON HIS EIGHTIETH BIRTHDAY OCTOBER 21, 1888 While through the land the strains resound What added fame can love impart To him who touched the string that found Its echoes in a Nation's heart? No stormy ode, no fiery march, His gentle memory shall prolong, But on fair Freedom's climbing arch, He shed the light of hallowed song. Full many a poet's labored lines A country's creeping waves will hide,â The verse a people's love enshrines Stands like the rock that breasts the tide. Time wrecks the proudest piles we raise,â The towers, the domes, the temples fall; The fortress ever crumbles and decays,â One breath of song outlasts them all. CENTENNIAL OF WASHINGTON'S INAUGURAL APRIL 30, 1889 Sceptres and thrones the morning realms have tried; Earth for the people kept her sunset side. Arts, manners, creeds the teeming Orient gave; Freedom, the gift that freights the refluent wave, Pays with one priceless pearl the guerdon due, And leaves the Old World debtor to the New. Long as the watch-towers of our crownless Queen Front the broad oceans that she sits between, May her proud sons their plighted faith maintain, And guard unbroken Union's lengthening chain,â Union, our peaceful sovereign, she alone Can make or keep the western world our own! TO SARAH WHITMAN From Nature's precious quarry sought, By hands untiring slowly wrought, Behold the smooth translucent sphere, As friendship's pledge made doubly dear! What stone so clear has mortal found? What figure like its faultless round? All else must try some flaw to screen,â But here perfection's self is seen. Come thou, my birth-day's fair surprise, And fill with light my fading eyes! Close to the clock thy place shall be,â The clock that chimes âRemember me!â Thrice welcome, blessed, beauteous gift! Thy silent speech our souls shall lift Like thee unchanging to endure Full-orbed, forever bright and pure. THE LIVING DYNAMO EDWARD EVERETT HALE APRIL 18, 1892 Night after night the incandescent arc Has fought its dazzling battle with the dark, Our doubtful paths with purest ray illumed, Untired, undimmed, unswerving, unconsumed. A slender wire the living light conveys That startles midnight with its noonday blaze. Through that same channel streams the giant force That whirls the wheels along their clanking course When, like a mail-clad monster o'er the plain, With clash and clamor sweeps the broomstick train. Whence gains the wondrous wire its two-fold dower, Its double heritage of light and power? Ask of the motor-man,âhe ought to know,â And he will tell you âfrom the dynamo.â And what, again, the dynamo inspires? âA mighty engine, urged by quickening fires.â When I behold that large, untiring brain Which seventy winters have assailed in vain Toiling, still toiling at its endless task, With patience such as Sisyphus might ask, To flood the paths of ignorance with light, To speed the progress of the struggling right, Its burning pulses borrowed from a heart That claims in every grist a brother's part, My lips repeat with reverence âEven soâ This is in truth a living Dynamo!â Be ours to heed its lessons while we may, Look up for light to guide our devious wayâ Look forward bravely, look not weakly back The past is done with, mind the coming track; Look in with searching eye and courage stout, But when temptation comes look out! look out! Heaven grant all blessings time and earth can give To him whose life has taught us how to live Till on the golden dial of the spheres The twentieth century counts its gathering years, While many a birthday tells its cheerful tale, And the round hundredth shouts All hail! All hail! POEM ON THE OCCASION OF THE PRESENTATION OF MY PORTRAIT TO THE PHILADELPHIA COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS APRIL 30, 1892 âHow came I here?â The portrait thus might speak,â The crimson mantling in its canvas cheek,â âHere in this concourse of the grave and wise Who look upon me with inquiring eyes, As on some homeless wanderer, caught astray? An error loci, Boerhaave would say. Is this great hive of industry my home? Where is the Common? Where my gilded dome? Where the Old South? The Frog pond? Most of all, My sacred temple, Freedom's Faneuil Hall?â No answer comes; no trick of human art Can force those fixed unmoving lips apart. He whom the picture shadows must explain This lawless inroad on a strange domain. Were it my votive offering, meant to show My grateful sense of all the debts I owe To your fair city, its unlooked-for face Might find no caviller to dispute its place. Yet though the friendly offering is not mine It bears my benediction to the shrine Where, if it meets a welcome, longer yet Will stretch the column which displays my debt. Friends of my earlier manhood, ever dear Whose lives, whose labors all were centred here How bright each figure stands before me now With eyes undimmed and fair unwrinkled brow, As when, with life before us yet untried, We walked the âLatin Quarterâ side by side Through halls of death, through palaces of pain That cast their shadows on the turbid Seine. When o'er our coffee, at the old âProcope,â Smiling we cast each other's horoscope Daring the future's dubious path to scan, Gerhard, your Gerhard was the coming man. Strong-brained, strong-willed, inquiring, patient, wise, He looked on truth with achromatic eyes; Sure to succeed, for Nature, like a maid, Loves best the lovers who are not afraid, Lends them her hand to lead them where they please, And trusts them boldly with her master-keys Behold, unfading on the rolls of fame. Typhus and Typhoid stamped with Gerhard's name. Look on the stately form at Gerhard's side He too shall live to be his city's pride. Tall, manly, quiet, grave, but not austere, Not slow of wit, a little dull of ear, Him we predestined to the place he won,â Norris, The Quaker City's noble son. Armed with the skill that science renders sure His look, his touch, were half his patients' cure; What need his merits I should further tell? His record stands; your pages know it well. Still wandering, lonely, mid the funeral urns To one loved name my saddening thought returns Less to the many known, but to the few A precious memory,âStewardson, to you. Through many a league we two together fared, The traveller's comforts and discomforts shared, When hills and valleys parted distant towns, Long ere the railway smoothed their ups and downs. In all the trials wearying days could bring No fretful utterance ever left its sting. Pity it was that, chased by pallid fears, He walked in shadow through his morning years, Talked of his early doom, and then, and then Lived on, and on, past three score years and ten. Too shy, perhaps too timid for success He fought life's battle bravely not the less,â Others left prouder memories, none more dear,â For those a sigh, for Stewardson a tear. Well, years rolled on, we went our several ways Not unrewarded with our meed of praise; Time took the weight and measure of our brains Set us our tasks and paid us for our pains At length (our side-locks fast were turning gray) He brought our art that all-important day When here our Aesculapian Congress met. (Its second gathering, you will not forget.) I with the crowd your far-famed city sought, Pleased to behold the schools where Rush had taught, Where Wistar labored and where Horner led His thirsting flock to Surgery's fountain-head. What kindly welcome with the rest I shared,â A little pleased,âperhaps a little scared, When Chapman hugged me in his huge embrace With praise that lit a bonfire in my face,â When Francis, guest at Mitchell's generous board, My humble name across the table roared, Coupled with one which figures on the roll Of England's poets,âbless his worthy soul! Garth,âgood Sir Samuel, whose poetic spark Scarce seen by day, still glimmers in the dark. These flitting phantoms of the past survive While grateful Memory keeps her fires alive. Friends of the days that fear and anguish knew My heart records a deeper debt to you. To this kind refuge, hallowed evermore, Her shattered sufferers fond affection bore. Full many a father tracked his bleeding son Fresh from the murderous conflict, lost or won, Strayed through some quiet ward, and looking round, In pity's sheltering arms the lost was found. Enough! Enough! these eyes will overflow In sweet remembrance of the debt I owe,â A debt 'twould bankrupt gratitude to pay,â But Heaven perhaps will hear me when I pray Peace to your borders! Long may science reign Supreme, unchallenged o'er her old domain! While sons as worthy as their sires of old Her borrowed sceptre still unbroken hold Till a new Rush shall teach his time to think, An unborn Leidy find the missing link. TO J. M. F. ON HIS EIGHTIETH BIRTHDAY FEBRUARY 23, 1893 I know thee well. From olden time Thou hadst a weakness for a rhyme. And wilt with gracious smile excuse The languor of a laggard muse, Whose gait betrays in every line The weight of years outnumbering thine. And who will care for blame or praise, When love each syllable betrays? The seven-barred gate has long been past, The eighth tall decade cleared at last; But when its topmost bar is crossed Think not that life its charm hath lost; Ginger will still be hot in mouth, And winter winds blow sometimes south, And youth might almost long to take A slice of fourscore's frosted cake. Thrice welcome to the chosen band, Culled from the crowd by Nature's hand: No warmer heart for us shall beat, No freer hand in friendship meet. Long may he breathe our mortal air, For heaven has souls enough to spare. Lay at his feet the fairest flowersâ Thank God he still is Earth's and ours. ELLEN TERRY HOMMAGE DE L'AUTEUR JANUARY 17, 1894 Sur la scÃ¨ne Toujours la Reine Sans diadÃ¨me Encore la mÃªme VERSION OF A FRAGMENT OF SAPPHO Godlike the mortal seems to me Nay greater than divinity Who sits by thee and all the while Can hear thy pleasant laugh and see thy smile! From me such vision steals my soul away My tongue is palsied,âI have naught to say A subtile flame Runs through each fibre of my joined frame, My ears are ringing and my sight grows dim Cold drops of sweat bedew each trembling limb My face grows white and every laboring breath Seems like the gasping harbinger of death. THE COMBINATION Thou wear'st a padlock on thy heart, A lock without a key; And none shall force its clasp apart Save only he Who gets its mystic letters in a row, And so Is lord of thee! What may they be? Try these four letters, G, O, L and D! It has not stirred. Now try L, O, V, Eâah! that's the word! EPITAPH I From his far isle the gentle stranger came Who taught our lips to love his liquid name, Found a new home beneath our western sky Won all our hearts and left us but to die. EPITAPH II Not his the Buddhist's creed, the Christian's name, Between two open doors a wind-blown flame; His was the largest faith, the heaven-born creed That shaped his life in thought, in speech, in deed. ILLUSION How oft, as children, on the stage We've seen with wonder-opening eyes A withered beldame bent with ageâ The kindly fairy in disguise! Not yet betrayed, through many a scene She creeps around with cloak and cane, So truthful in her speech and mien To doubt her wrinkles were profane. With trembling voice and tottering feet She limps along from act to act Still genuine in her thin deceit To simple eyes; an honest fact. What e'er the sable robe conceals No truant fold of gauze betrays, No straying border yet reveals The gorgeous mantle's hidden blaze. Four acts and something more have pastâ Still virtue seems the losing sideâ Each wrong more crushing than the lastâ When lo! The sable robes divide; The villain fliesâthe maiden kneelsâ Behold! in angel splendors drest From plume crowned head to spangled heels The great enchantress stands confest! IN THE DEAD SEASON CAMBRIDGE In the dead season when the boughs are bare And chill from Labrador the wild winds blow Beneath these outstretched arms that show so fair In hanging sleeves that Summer bids them wear A pilgrim round his birth-place wandering slow As wayward memory led him here or there, With lingering footsteps tracked the virgin snow. Stripped of his royal vestments, naked, lone, The immemorial monarch of the plain Sat crownless, shivering on his marble throne; Full many a bitter winter had he known And shook his leaves in many a blinding rain And felt his far-stretched rootlets tug and strain When the roof-rending hurricane had blown. Then he whom cradle memories lured to stray Beneath the shadeless boughs that idly spread Their net of crossing branches, tangled spray, Against the sky's round hollow, dull and gray With clouds portending tempest, overhead, Saw the Greek page before him where he read âAs forest-leaves the tribes of men decay.â The mighty deeds whereof the world hath sung As each slow-moving century led its train Art, History, Verse have shaped and told and sung Vain all the toil of chisel, pencil, tongue Image and record and resounding strainâ Vain is the sweetest lyre that hand hath strung Marble and scroll and canvas, all are vain. From dark abysses burst the ravening tides And grind with foaming jaws the wasting land O'er sunken Tyre the conqueror's trireme rides To shineless night the bannered navy glides Memnon sinks voiceless in the Lybian sand Through Balbec's arch the giant keystone slides The sceptre falls from mummied Pharoah's hand. Earth, like a worn out medal shews no more Her date and superscription; whence she came Spinning her endless circles o'er and o'er Turning the shore to sea, the sea to shore, Forever changing, evermore the same, Paving with mountain peaks her ocean floor, No sage may guess, no prophet may proclaim. Still wandering on he reached the holy ground Where, under mossy slab and slanted stone And shining obelisk and swelling mound The silent generations slumber round The village fathers modest Fame had known Captains and Deacons, mighty men renowned Whose crumbling bones the churchyard calls its own. And with them mingled some of statelier name, The ruffled Tory true to church and crown, Esquire and Colonel; and the lofty dame Whose glistening satin puts our pride to shame As Copley's canvas hands her proudly down; And grand divines whose Presidential fame Once filled the grave old Academic town. LOVE While sunset stains the windows of the west In parting glory drest, Ere yet the evening star leads in the hours That hush all voices in their leafy bowers Save the lone bird's that shuns the light; Ere in the burning chamber of the night With sacramental rite Of dewdrops on the cerements of the flowers Its burden dropped, its sins confessed Our long drawn day is laid at length at rest We, flung together as the seeds are thrown The sower's hand has strown, But clinging as the iron sands that feel The soul-like effluence of the enchanted steel, We whom the years have tried And clustered closer, striving to divide, Beside our altar kneel And thank the gracious Power that made our own The sacred gift of love the best that life has known. For what has life but love when all is told? Fame? pleasure? empire? gold? Fame breeds the worm that gnaws its greenest leaves; Pleasure is hope that smiles and still deceives; Power! target of envenomed cares! Gold! See the rippled brow the ash-hued hairs Its hoarding vassal wears! A sable woof the loom of fate inweaves With every web by time unrolled; Love, only love it wraps in snow-white fold. THE POET GROWS OLD How I cut the fresh branches of succulent rhyme In the spring of my years, my asparagus time! To clip them, to bind them, how light was the toil, As each morning they sprouted afresh from the soil! Spring passed, still my pages of silvershod lines Filled up like the pods on my marrow fat vines; Uncared for they grew and unasked for they came,â The peas and the poems,âwith both 'twas the same. And when the last crop on the meadow was mown, When the apples were ripe, when the song-birds had flown, My harvest of verse was awaiting me still For the corn-field stood ready my basket to fill. But winter has come with his icicle-spear And built his white throne on the grave of the year The blossoms are snowflakes he flings to the gale And the seed that he casts in the furrow is hail. The fields are all bare and the harvest is o'er I come with my sickle and basket no more; But a rusty old spade, and I prospect around For the bread-fruit of Erin that grows underground. TO AN AUTOGRAPH COLLECTOR When next you wish an autograph, I hope You'll furnish paper, stamp and envelope; Why, when you tax a hard-worked weary man, Not save him all the trouble that you can? TO A BRIGHT BOY I trust my counsel you will heedâ You're almost too quick witted; Your brain is like a fiery steed That needs to be well bitted Don't treat it like a wooden toy A child may safely play with; You'd better hold it tight, my boy, Or you'll be run away with! TO CORINNA Star of my childhood, long withdrawn And veiled to me in midnight shade, Still glowing on the mists of morn Thine early light can never fade. Thy glance perchance has lightly past And wondered at my altered brow, But thou as when I saw thee last So are thy breathing features now. The same dark hairâthe same wild eyeâ The voice like dying music's flowâ All seems as in the days gone by Though woman's heart beats warm below Our paths have parted far and wide, They met but for a single hour, But winds that roam the troubled tide Still bear the fragrance of the flower Thus to my memory thou hast beenâ Thus to my future thou shalt be; Though chance may dash her waves between They cannot part my dreams from thee And by thy pathway dark or bright Fair girl, it yet may give thee joy To know that thou hast touched with light The visions of a nameless boy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">APPENDIX. II. ADDITIONAL VERSES FROM THE OLDEST PORTFOLIO 1822â1833 âPERDIDI DIEM.â TIBERIUS JULY 25, 1822 âI've lost a day,â old Tibby said, Then sighed and groaned, and went to bed. This monarch, as they said of old, Knew time was worth much more than gold. I'm of this sage opinion too, And think this man judged pretty true. âBut now, my friends, I'll bid good bye, For you are tiredâand so am I. CHARITABLE ANN Charitable Annâ Give this poor manâ As much as you canâ A little meat And bread to eat And a shady seatâ HASTY PUDDING MAY 2, 1828 For soon appeared the smiling pot Brimful of pudding, smoking hot With ready step and joyful faces The glad providers took their places Soon as their bowls and spoons they found To make all square they helped us round Two different ways their footsteps tend For one began at either end And therefore these providers seem To carry things to the extreme SERENADE The moon is up, and soft and bright, And tender is her light in June, For is this not a lovely night, And is not that a splendid moon? Oh, that you knew how often, love, When I was in the tropic sea, My eyes were on the moon above While thought was wandering back to thee. And when we lost the polar star, Far southward of the central line, To you I struck the soft guitar, And was your moonlight song like mine? For mine was love, as still it is; And shall it be forever crost, And must I in a night like this But sigh to find âLove's Labour Lostâ? TO M. C. D. I thank thee for the silken prizeâ So sweetly shines its heavenly blue That one might think thine own bright eyes Had kindled the celestial hue Or that a cloud from heaven had strayed, And tinged it with its softest shade. As round the vaulted dome of night A thousand radiant cressets shine So flame these points of silver light That bound the azure circles line And brighter seem the rays to me Because their lustre came from thee. In every collar's loosened tieâ In every stitch that time shall strainâ When night obscures my troubled sky Those stars shall scatter light againâ O then shall grateful memory turn And think of her who bade them burn. P. S. My gratitude will never cool, My sister says so too. I fear that when she sees a fool She'll always think of you BURIAL OF A MAIDEN AT SEA O lay her in the stormy grave, And soft her slumbers be, Her pillow is the mountain wave, Her tomb the boundless sea. Old Ocean round the maiden's breast His mantle green shall fold, And angels guard her silent rest Beneath the waters cold. Still shall the angry tempests sweep, The ceaseless tide shall flow; But wind, nor wave, shall break her sleep Who lies in peace below. Farewell! The waves are closing fast Around thy fading form; O may thy spirit find at last, A home without a storm. THE LOVER'S RETURN O, tell me, my daughter, why is it, that now There's a tear in thine eye, and a cloud on thy brow? Thy footsteps no longer are light in the vale, And the cheek, once so rosy, is haggard and pale. âI will bring thee, my daughter, a garland so fair, To entwine in the locks of thy dark waving hair.â âIts freshness will fade, and its bloom will decay, Then weave me no wreaths that will wither away.â âI will bring thee a gem, that shall sparkle as bright As the planet that flames on the girdle of night.â âI ask not thy jewels, their splendor is vain, They will soothe not my slumbers, will ease not my pain.â âOh weep not, my daughter, while others are gay, It is not for thee to be grieving to day; Let sorrow no longer o'ershadow thy charms, For thy long absent lover has come to thine arms.â The gloom passed away from the brow of his child; Full deeply she crimsoned, but sweetly she smiled; And soon by her lover, the maiden did stand, With a wreath in her tresses, a gem on her hand. FORGOTTEN AGES HARVARD COLLEGE EXHIBITION APRIL 28, 1829 From yon high chamber, on whose naked walls The slanting ray of rosy morning fallsâ Where kind Aurora showers her earliest beams To wake the sleeper from delusive dreamsâ Where playful zephyrs riot through the floor Laugh at the cracks and revel round the doorâ From that bright home the poet gladly flies To meet the radiance of these brighter eyes. What various beauties crowd upon my sight Flash from the left and sparkle from the right. The matron's sweetness and the maiden's bloomâ The flaunting ribband and the waving plumeâ Blushes that saucers never owned before And looks unpurchased from the fancy-storeâ In queenly pride the lofty head-dress towers And bonnets blossom with unfading flowersâ Their different charms the smiling sisters blend, All nature gives, and all that art can lend. âO envious time, could not thy chariot stay A moment longer on its silent way? Must all they glories burst upon the eye, Like angel's pinions, only as they fly! How short our empire on this little stage! How swift these moments in the train of age! In vain the light that beauty sheds around To stay our footsteps on the enchanted ground. Time waves his wandâthe short-lived pageant flies And other hours, and other forms arise. âAs fades the memory of an idle day The name of ages hastens to decay: Wrapped in the past, in darkness disappears The gleam of moments and the light of years. âO where, forgotten in the silent shade Are all the forms, that once had being, laid? Where sunk the palace and where fell the throne On which the sun of ancient splendor shone? Nations have been where we may look in vain For one frail remnant on the voiceless plain. Unchecked the mind around the desert flows Where proud Ambition's lofty turrets rose. Some wasted slowly into dull decay Till stone by stone, their grandeur dropped away. The conqueror came, and in a single hour Fell the bright trophies of imperial power. Some sank beneath the red volcanic wave And after ages trod their burning graveâ The surge has rolled o'er many an ancient shore And Ocean sweeps where man has reigned before. âQuenched is the lustre of the glancing eyeâ Cold is the heart that once beat warm and highâ The lips that nature only formed for smiles Lie in the ashes of their buried piles. In thousand paths the subtle shafts have fled And none is leftâthe herald of the dead. The torch of famine seared the dying land, The warrior fell beneath another's hand. And slow disease hath wasted many a form, That rode in triumph on the battle-storm. âThey sleep, unconscious that the hour has come When all that echoed to their voice is dumb; Alike to them if o'er their dark repose The forest blossoms or the ocean flows. The hand of spring their funeral chaplet weaves, And autumn strews them with his withered leaves; Or wildly murmuring round their stormy home The towering billow stoops its crest of foam. In vain they bade their mausoleums rise, And reared their pillars till they reached the skies. No stone is rescued from the dust to tell Where once they stood and where at last they fell âO'er other lands that wore the crown of old The shroud of age is gathering fold by fold. But still half-lost amid the deepening gloom The dying sun-beam plays around their tomb. Though art has risen from her native clime All is not darkened in the clouds of time; We trace her brightness in the lingering glow Her foot has kindled while it walked below. The stately relics of departed prideâ The temple mouldering by its builder's side. The prostrate column and the fallen shrine Point to the days that saw their glory shine, And tell the stranger on their hallowed ground That man is crumbling in the soil around. And some have lived, if that be life which Fame, When all is dust, can lavish on a name; Still rings the harp that Athens loved to hear And bright-eyed Thalia woos the modern's ear. But they who called her from the mountain-steepâ Can music wake them from their silent sleep?â âAnd we, the children of a later birth, The transient monarchs of this changing earth, We too shall pass and leave no single trace To fix our memory on some future race. Our heroes glory in the crimson wreath Their hands have wrested from the brow of death They little see it, in their fevered dream, Torn by the ripple of the noiseless stream: Our rulers frame their statutes for the free Of after ages that shall never be. The luckless votaries of Apollo's lyre Catch far more real than poetic fire; And vainly scatter from their pictured urns, Not âthoughts that breathe,â but âmany a word that burns.â âSo flies a moment, and so rolls an age, Monarchs and poets quit alike the stage; They leave at last their sceptre and their crown, We gently bow and lay our laurels down. If our young Muse has managed to beguile Her fairer sisters of one favoring smileâ If hard-heeled students and if booted boys Will aid her exit with their flattering noiseâ If sterner age will spare the humble lays And kindly pardon what it cannot praise, Though e'er tomorrow it shall be forgot, That she has hovered round this little spot, Without a murmur that her feeble wings Must share the fate of empires and of kings, No longer fluttering in your wearied sight, She folds her mantle and she takes her flight. A POEM HARVARD COLLEGE COMMENCEMENT AUGUST 26, 1829 As the proud champion in the days of old Ere the deep thunders for the onset rolled Turned to the ranks where beauty's bright array Rose like the crescent on the brow of day And sought through all the glowing forms to trace His own fair lady in the crowded place To ask the favour of one gentle sighâ To claim one tribute from her glancing eye So would we turn, in anxious hope to find Some pitying symptoms from the fair and kind And ask for mercy as we humbly bow Down at their feet our laurel cinctured brow. âAnd this dread moment is at last our own And we are left unpitied and alone With beating heart and trembling hands to dare The idle glanceâthe stern unwavering stare The sneers of youthâthe darker frown of age The schoolboy critic and the solemn sage The pensive miss who listens as she sighs For âgolden ringletsâ and for âsunny skiesâ The nameless being whose existence fills What would be vacuum in his faultless gills The sober people that consult the time And think of dinner in despite of rhyme And those that crowd around the sacred door To see the place they never saw before. âFair creatures kindling with a starlike glow The hallowed precincts of the lofty row Since ye are straining all your eyes to scan The curves and angles of our outer man And we all quivering with disdain must feel Your curious looks that creep from crown to heel Since fate's dark pleasure has decreed to day That you must hear what we shall choose to say To make at once the mutual compact fair We turn to you and find our subject there. âWe be your subject lisps the miss of ten Why poets are as impudent as men! We be your subject! cries the shrinking belle This horrid bonnet! but the gown looks wellâ Pray did he think we wanted to be seen In Cupid's name what does the creature mean? The married lady hints that she allows No such remarks from her well managed spouse Or whispers glancing at her wedding ring I wish my husband had said such a thing. âBid all your fans their slender veils expand Knit the fair brow and clench the little hand The timid miss is happy ere she flies To light her taper in your flashing eyes. âThere sits the wifeâand though a wife may seem A curious subject for the poet's dream Yet there is something in that gentle name That wakes the slumbers of the soul to flame. When the last angel winged his silent way From earth's dark shadows to a brighter day Yet erring man of heavenly forms bereft Could thank his God that one at least was left. O had our mother like the modern Eves Robed her fair brow in those luxuriant sleeves Then had poor Adam like their husbands known How hard his fortune who is all alone And walked in sorrow by his blooming bride Some twenty paces from the lady's side. âOn yonder seatâbut Fancy says beware Nor wake the vengeance that is slumbering there By all your prospects, as you hope to claim A lasting record on the page of fame Tread not too rashly on the sacred ground Where the soft votary of the muse is found. The time has been when nature's simple child Was free and fearless in his forest wild His lovely savage in her native grace Asked not the aid of ribbons or of lace She read no novels poems or reviews And men were happy in the want of blues. The times have changedâthe steps of womankind Are first and foremost in the march of mind The housewife's manual sleeps upon the shelves They readâthey writeâthey criticise themselves. Turn for a moment to that youthful fair With dovelike aspect and with gentle air Who softly flutters with her little fan And looks as much like fainting as she can. If you have seenâand by a victim's tears The sight is common in these latter years A fair haired maiden who forever sought For what she called âa sweet poetic thoughtâ Who wrote in lines that jingled at their ends And kept an album for her private friends Then gentle hearer you indeed have seen The female monster that our verses mean. Trust not the light of her insidious smile Tis but the splendour of your funeral pile Though all the graces in her pout appear That pink leaved album follows in the rear. âNor there alone the fleeting muse require To waste the glimmer of her waning fire While lips like thine celestial beauty claim The worthless offering of her feeble flame. Fairest of beings, if thy melting eyes Have caught the azure of the summer skies Or the pure spirit send its flashes through The kindling shadows of a darker hue If oer thy forehead parts the raven fold Or the bright tresses float in liquid gold We own thy influence and we bow to thee The atheist's Godâthe despot of the free We coldly bend at many a prouder throne But the heart's homageâit is all thine own. âOur time is pastâwe may not stay to raise The idle paeans of unneeded praise If the poor graduate's ever frugal board Shall soon or late so strange a thing afford One classic tribute shall at least be thineâ The deepest bumper of the brightest wineâ TO S?L? Yet wert thou falseâin vain the smiles That played in light around thee A seraph in an icy chain That sparkled while it bound thee I can forget theeâall hath fled Save one half buried gleam Of what thou wastâand what thou art Shall be a nameless dreamâ RHYMED CHRONICLE The Praeses has a weekly row, I think they call it a levee, And people say it's very fine; I'm sure it's flat enough to me. Judge Story's bought a horse in town; The law school every day grows bigger; And Sukey LenoxâI forgot, I've told you all about the nigger. One fellow lately came from Maine, And now there is another comer; And one is Upton called by name. And t'other one is christened Dummer. The undergraduates have made Proposals for a monthly paper, Which I am very much afraid Will end in something worse than vapor. I wish I had a little room,â It makes my heart feel very sadly, When I have so much news to tell To crowd it up so very badly. The folks have bolted up the doors, And I have bolted down my supper. My pony threw me t'other day And very nearly broke my crupper. Get Blackwood's Magazine and read The story of the modern Gyges; And if you ride a coltish steed Be careful of your âos coxygis.â The college servant took some books And laid the mischief to the students, But as it happened to be false We thought him guilty of impudence.

AN ENIGMA I In light, in shade, its changing form appears, Now clothed in blushes, and now bathed in tears; It spreads its wings upon the summer air, And sits in silence on the mountain bare; Wrapped in the shadows of its gloomy breast, The springs of life, the fires of vengeance, rest; It floats in kindness, and it flies in wrath, And skies grow darker in its awful path; It paints the petal of the dying flower, It shakes the temple, and it rocks the tower! Its shaft strikes down the lovely and the brave; Yet will it turn and weep upon their grave. ENIGMA II It came unheard, and darkness veiled its birth, The child of heaven, yet only seen on earth; It lay half hidden in the folded leaves, The sleeping floweret round her bosom weaves, And when the moonbeam touched it from afar, It shone and sparkled like a fallen star; But ah, it trembled in the breath of day, And softly faded like a dream away. Such was its fateâand thus, without a stain, It came to earth, and sought the skies again; A rosy cradle, and a golden shroud, Born in a flower, and dying in A CLOUD. RUNAWAY BALLADS I Wake from thy slumbers, Isabel, the stars are in the sky, And night has hung her silver lamp, to light our altar by; The flowers have closed their fading leaves, and droop upon the plain, O wake thee, and their dying hues shall blush to life again. In such a sacred hour as this, how beams the eye of love, When all is mellowed shade below, and all is light above; And oh, how soft a maiden's sigh melts on the midnight air, When scarce a wantom zephyr breathes, to wave her silken hair. The rattle of the soldier's steel has left the silent hall, The mastiff slumbers at the gate, the sentry on the wall; And there, by many a stately barge, that rocks upon the tide, A bark is floating on the waves and dancing by their side. And when before the flowing wind she spreads her eagle wings, And like a halcyon, from her breast the shivered billow flings; Though many a prouder pendant flies before the ocean breeze, No keel can track her foaming path, that sweeps the sparkling seas. Then come to me, my lovely one, and haste we far away, And we will reach the distant isle before the break of day; Let not thy gentle eyes grow dim, thy rosy cheek grow pale, For thou shalt find a beating heart beneath a warrior's mail. II Get up! get up! Miss Polly Jones, the tandem's at the door; Get up, and shake your lovely bones, it's twelve o'clock and more, The chaises they have rattled by, and nothing stirs around, And all the world, but you and I, are moving safe and sound. I broke a drunken watchman's nap, and he began to mutter, I gave him just a gentle tap, that helped him to the gutter; The cur-dog growled an ugly growl, and grinned a bitter grin; I tipped the beast a rat's-bane pill, to keep his music in. When Squaretoes stumps about the house, and doesn't find you there, And all the folks are in a touse, my eyes! how dad will stare! He locked and double-locked the door, and saw you safe abed, And never dreamed a jailor's paw could scratch a booby's head. Come hurry! hurry! Polly Jones, it is no time to snooze; Don't stop for t'other petticoat, nor fidget for your shoes; I have a quilted wrapper here, your tender limbs to fold, It's growing mighty chilly, dear, and I shall catch a cold. I've got my gouty uncle's bay, and trotting Peggy too, I've lined their tripes with oats and hay, and now for love and you; The lash is curling in the air, and I am at your side, To-morrow you are Mrs. Snaggs, my bold and blooming bride. ROMANCE O! she was a maid of a laughing eye, And she lived in a garret cold and high; And he was a threadbare, whiskered beau, And he lived in a cellar damp and low. But the rosy boy of the cherub wing Hath many a shaft for his slender string, And the youth below and the maid above Were touched with the flaming darts of love. And she would wake from her troubled sleep, O'er his tender billet-doux to weep; Or stand like a statue cold and fair, And gaze on a lock of his bright red hair. And he who was late so tall and proud, With his step so firm and his laugh so loud; His beard grew long and his face grew thin, As he pined in solitude over his gin. But one soft night in the month of June, As she lay in the light of a cloudless moon, A voice came floating soft and clear, To the startled maiden's listening ear. O then from her creaking couch she sprung, And her tangled tresses back she flung; She looked from the window far below, And he stood beneathâher whiskered beau! She did not start with a foolish frown, But she packed her trunk, and she scamper'd down; And there was her lover tall and true, In his threadbare coat of the brightest blue. The star that rose in the evening shade Looked sadly down on a weeping maid; The sun that came in his morning pride Shed golden light on a laughing bride. SCENES FROM AN UNPUBLISHED PLAY I (BACK-ROOM AT PORTER'SâDICK, SOLUS.) I am not well to-nightâmethinks the fumes Of overheated punch have something dimmed The cerebellum or pineal gland, Or where the soul sits regent. Strange that things Born of the grosser elements of earth Should cloud the mind's own heaven with fantasies! I am no babyâlook upon that leg All laced with steely sinewsâsee that arm, Embossed with swelling muscleâand this shape Of nature's best expansionâwere they made But to be sneered at by the grinning imps That leave the dotard's slumbers visionless, To play their antics in the teeth of manhood? (Fellow, another measure of your compound, And be less liberal of your aqueous tincture.) A man who hath been elbowed out of office, A poet who hath sown some score of verses, And reaped one sorry sentence of damnation, Look down i' the mouth, and feel unutterablyâ But one who is not plagued with corporal evils, Who feels not hungry, save at dinner time, And is not snarled at by the world about him, Can do but little, save to fume and fret At air-born hydras of imagination. And yet, in these same most degenerate days, There be some things that do much gall a man (Looking at his boots.) Methinks the polish of these nether casings Is not so radiant as it was of oldâ Perhaps the varlet who doth give them lustre Hath ta'en to reading of philosophy, For learning has of late put off her wings, And creeps along with beggars in the dust.â Why, I have seen a kitchen-nurtured wench, With feet that seemed like mountain pedestals, And fingers redder than the peony, Who tripped so daintily upon the earth, As she were stepping on Elysian flowers; And did so dally with the household stuff, As if a saucepan were an instrument Fit for the music of angelic choirs. She'd quote you loving ditties by the hour, And scribble verses in your Sunday bible, And talk to you of starlight, and of flowers, And mind, and metaphysics. Out upon themâ I'd rather have a Patagonian savage, One that can grapple with the mountain bear, And eat him as a Christian eats a chicken, Than such a mincing thing to wait upon me. Fellow, here's money for thine aliments, I must away. (Exit.) II (DICK, SOLUS WITH A NEWSPAPER.âSMOKING PITCHER ON THE TABLE) No murders and no robberies,âspeechesâspeeches, Column on column one eternal speech; Now I had rather read your pirate-stories, Of men minced up and shovelled overboard, Your slitting throats, and knocking out of brains, And such well-spiced misdoingsâ (Enter TOM.) Save you, Tom, How goes your nothingship,âand gentle Julia, How does she fare,âthe lady of thy love. Tom. Her good old grandam's deadâ Dick. Why then the devil May sharpen up his claws to deal with her; She was a potent vixen in her day. Tom. Be pleased to tread less rudely on the ashes Of one that was a woman. You are wont To speak unfitly of the fairest thing That stepped on Eden's roses. Why should man Scoff at the creatures he was made to love? It is as if the iron-fibred oak Should tear the clasping tendrils.â Dick. Save your nonsense To feed your starving poetry withal; I hate to see resuscitated thoughts Come sneaking back to life in ladies's albums. Pray talk to me as if I were a man,â Look,âdo I wear a petticoat or breeches? Have I long locks? Is this a woman's foot? Is aught of silver in these brazen tones? Fill up your glass,âhere's to thy sanity. Tom. O beast! You drink as if you were a Titan, Just hot from Etna. What would Julia say, If she could dream of such abominations! Dick. Would she might taste this punch! I much opine She'd soon forswear her ghostly milk and water. O thou art good! 't would vivify a statue, Could statue but its marble lips unclose: I would I were upon an ocean of theeâ A bowl my boatâa ladle for mine oar: Green islands in the ever-blooming south Should scatter flowers upon theeâand the fires That roll and flash in earth's unfathomed bosom, Should keep thee steaming hot. That's poetry. Tom. Insensate wretch; can nothing stir thy soul, But tempests brewed from earthly elements? No light break through thy darkness, save a gleam, The offspring of corruption? Is there nought Can cheat thee for a moment of thy grossness? Dick. He's talking big,âI'll wake the imp within him. (Aside.) I cannot blame theeânay, I pity thee For such unseemly license of thy tongue; Touched in the brain,âI feared it might be so; 'T was wrongâit was most cruel in the girl, To play so false a game. Who would have thought it,â A coach, a parson, and a man in whiskers. Tom. Oh devil! what! speak, let me hear it allâ Not Julia! Parson! whiskers! tell me all, And I will love thee. Dick. Who has spoke of Julia? Are there no women in the world but Julia? I was but thinking of an ancient spinster, Miss Sally or Miss Celia Somebody, That ran away from Time to play with Cupid. Tom. Lend me your kerchiefâI am much exhausted: What if I'd drawn that razorâ Dick. There'd have been Another tombstone, and a lie upon it. I would have dressed you an obituary, That should be really decent, and have written With mine own hands a fancy epitaph. Tom. Come, you are caustic,âbut you know my nature. I'll show thee something for thine age to dream of, A token of her beauty and her love; Look at that auburn ringlet, boy, and think On what a peerless brow it must have floated! Her own white fingers did unweave the ray From the soft coronal of light and beauty. Dick. Call you that auburn? it is hardly crimson. There is a something of Aurora redâ A something like to filaments of flame,â And yet they are not cobwebs in their texture, Right thick and rosy. Tom. Ha! what is't you say? Take that to help you in your rhetoric. (Striking DICK.) Dick. Infant! I will not beat thee. Here's a chair. And here's a neckclothâyes, and here's a towel, And I will truss thee like a callow goose. (Trying him to the chair.) So, thou art fixed, thou paralytic tigerâ I'm sorry to have been so rough with thee, How is it, do you call it auburn still? Tom. Were every muscle beaten to a pulp, And my bones powdered, I would call it auburn. Dick. There's tragedy! It shall be auburn, then. Hark, there's a step with something leaden in it, As one that is not full of merriment,â I'll fling my cloak upon youâthere, keep still. Tom. I'm d?dly battered, an' it please the Tutor. (Enter TUTOR.) Tutor. Men ye are troublous,âthere has been a noise, As of exceeding vehement discussion. If ye must talk of controverted things, Wait till your beards do give you gravity. (Exit.) III (DICK, solus.) Ayâif a viper coiled upon her doorstepâ If the broad river were a stream of fire And I must cross it on a raft of tinderâ If Cerberus stood keeper of the toll, And I were pennilessâI'd see the girl. A vixen and a jiltâbut still I love her. An arrant baggage, who would tear my letters To paper up her hairâbut still I love her. Not that the rose is fairer on her cheek, Not that the light is brighter in her eye, Than half the seraph sisterhood can boast. Where lurks the influence that thus can steal, Like the sweet music of a prisoned lyre, Through all the marble barriers of the heart? So are we tempered, that we know not why We love or hate, we follow or we shun. Is it in outward seeming? do we stoop To meet the bending statute? do we press The lips that glow unbreathing on the canvas? Nay, are there not a thousand living shapes That are like shadows to the listless soul, Lifeless and pulseless? yet we turn from them To one less fair, and think her born of heaven. Who sees the bow when Love lets loose the shaft? A plague upon the nice anatomy That cuts up feeling into curves and angles. Her eye is blueâand so too is her bonnetâ Her forehead whiteâso is a sheet of paperâ Her hair is goldenâI can buy enough Of just such hair to fill a bushel basketâ Her voice is smoothâwhy so is milk and water; And this is what you get for analyzing. But take her in the whole, form, voice, and motion, I love the compound.âIf she loves not me, Why, she has lost aâmight pretty fellow; A six-foot man, with most effulgent whiskers, And two good hands to put in empty pockets. I wonder how my grandam stood the frost. How the old spider hangs upon her cobweb! They say her will is made, and when she tumbles, Perhaps a pension to her gray-beard tom-cat, Some small post mortem acts of piety, To crutch her poor rheumatic soul upon, And I shall dust the dear old lady's guineas. Ha! when we rattle in our own good tandem, And crack the ivory-handled whip we paid for, There'll be a stir among the plumes and ribbons! Lightly he treads who steps on golden slippersâ Sweetly he speaks whose purse has music in it. Pray die, dear grandam; we will have you buried All nice and decent, and we'll have a sermon To call you pretty names, and buy some kerchiefs To soak up bitter tears, and feed your tomcat, As if he never scratched usâcurse upon him. (Enter six BORES.) All. A pleasant eveningâ Dick. Yes a pleasant evening, A devilish pleasant evening out of doors. 1st Bore. What have you here to eat? I am not hungry, But I might taste a pie; I am not thirsty, But I might drink to please these honest fellows; Or, as I mean to sit, I'll smoke a little. Dick. We're out of victual and we're out of wine, There's water in the pailâsmoke and be d?d. 2d Bore. Lend me a book, I mean to sit a little, And I am not in mood for conversation. Dick. Here's Worcester's Walker's Johnson's Dictionary; Open at Assâa very fitting subject. 3d Bore. I saw your very worthy grandmother A short time since; she seemed extremely hearty. O what a blessing such a woman is! In all the circle of domestic love There is no greaterâ Dick. No, there is no greaterâ Just as you sayâa most eternal blessing. 4th Bore. I'll take a napâyou'll wake me in an hour, Or two at farthestâso I'll shut the door. (Goes into the bedroom.) Dick. And I will lock it. Sleep till bedbugs wake you. (Locks the door.) 5th Bore. Come boy, let's have a game or two of chequers Before we try the chess, and then backgammon, Or else a little whistâjust run along And order up some claret and some oysters. Dick. My board is broken and my foot is lame. 6th Bore. I think of making something of a call, And so I'll take my coat and waistcoat off, Wait a few hours until the rest are gone And I will read you something I have written. (Cry of fire.) Five Bores. O, there's a rowâgood nightâwe'll call again. (Exeunt five BORES.) Dick, solus. Go, blessed boobies, and the devil singe youâ Sleep, snoring lubber, and the night-fiend gnaw youâ Another step before the door is bolted! (Enter TOM.) Ah, soft Lothario, with thy lady cheek, Didst thou exhale upon us from a dew-drop? Or wast thou wafted on an evening zephyr? Tom. I hang myself to-morrowâJulia's bolted! Off in a tangent with that ugly captain! I did not care for JuliaâI was tired Of all her tricks and fanciesâbut to think Of such a rocket tied to such a stick Would make one hang himself for human folly. So once again, for universal woman! Does the new coat sit close about the waist? Dick. Ay, put a pismire's girdle on a porpoise, It will sit closer than a sailor's jacket. Now diet for a while on water-gruel, And take a dose or two of bleaching salts, And run a razor round the barren course, And when you're hanged for stealing, men will say He was a pale, thin pigmy, with a beard. Tom. Why, man you're biting as a seedling radish. Did Clara pout? nay, do not look so rosy, Her mother told me all about your love, And asked me of your prospects and your standing; I told herâbut no matter what I told her. Dick. The wrinkled hagâand thou, infernal imp, What didst thou say? Tom. I only now remember Some general hints about your evil habits, Your sad propensity to gin and water, Your singular asperity of temperâ I did not call you absolutely dirty, But only rather slovenly and carelessâ For rank, that you was like a serpent's rattle, That makes some noise, though very near the tailâ That as to money, save the bills you owed, You had but little to remind you of it. I did not like it, but it was my duty, And I am honest, so I tell you all. Dick. Now, fellow, I will mash you to a pumice, Or beat thee to a tumorâ Tom. Hold a moment It was all stuffâI never saw the woman; But since you seemed in such a frosty mood, I fired a squib at your philosophy And laughed to see it catchâso keep your beating To make your children grow.âNow come along And drown your anger in a good potation. Dick. And you curry people down with lies, And smooth it with a julep. But I'll go, And leave that sleeping carrion in the bedroom, Among his brother vermin,âpeace be with him. (Exeunt.) THE CANNIBAL I had a strange and fearful dream, It lingers in my brain, I've tried to blot its traces out, But I have tried in vain; I would not for an angel's crown Have such a dream again. It was a dark and stormy night, And I was all alone, When suddenly upon mine eye A ghastly splendor shone, And a fiery figure stalked along, And I heard a hollow moan. He was a shape of giant size, He looked all gaunt and grim; It seemed as if my locks and bolts Were but as threads to him;â I always double lock my door, For I am short and slim. My tongue it cleaved unto my jaws, As it were in a vice; My heart lay cold upon my ribs, As any lump of ice; My knees they rattled fearfully, As men do rattle dice. He opened wide his earthquake jaws, And up his arm he flung; Then I did give a feeble cry, And to the bed-post clung, For he had mighty lion teeth, And a flaming, forked tongue. He said he was a canibal, And that he walked by night, And that he once had been a man, But now he was a sprite, And that he knew how I was young, And came to take a bite. And then he pinched my meagre cheek, And felt my shoulders spare, And growled and grumbled over me, And pawed me like a bear; Then I did think of all my sins, And tried to say a prayer. He swore it was full many a day Since mortal flesh he saw, And now he thought a burning coal Was lying in his maw; With that he gnawed me with his teeth, And clutched me with his claw. Then I did try once more to shriek, And sight and hearing fled, But I could feel him munching me, As people munch their bread, And poison breathing from his lips, Like vapors from the dead. When he had done his meal he flung My carcass in a sack, And shouldered what there was of me, As pedlars do their pack;â I woke,âit was my breakfast-time, And I was on my back. AN INVOCATION (TRANSLATED FROM THE ARABIC) âAwake! Awake! Spirits of air!â âWe sleep by day, and we watch by night, And we flash on the darkness in meteor-light; But a shade is over the mortal eye, And it sees us not as we hurry by, Well do we know that voice of thine, We hear the word, and we see the sign.â âAwake! Awake! Spirits of Fire, Come from the glow of the flames below, And gather around your sire.â âWe come, we come as the lightening flies, With the treasured wrath of the brooding skies, When it leaps from the cloud on the murderer's head, And tears the shroud from the guilty dead, And rips the sail from the quivering mast As it rocks on the billow and bows in the blast; We come, we come, we dare not stay For we heard the sound that we all obey.â âSpirits of earth, Awake! Awake! Your master callsâfrom your sunless halls, Come, ere the thunders break.â âWe come, we come at the dreadful sign From the crystal cave, and the golden mine, Where the gathered rays of the diamond gleam, And the ruby burns with its crimson beam; Where, for long ages, our treasures we look In the womb of the cavern, the heart of the rock, We come, for we know the voice that flings The chain that can fetter our sable wings.â âSpirits of ocean, come around, For ye have heard the mystic word, And well ye know the sound.â âWe come, we come from the gloomy wave Where we float along by the sailor's grave, And cling to the spars of the shattered wreck, And build our thrones on the voiceless deck, And where in the bright green ocean ray, With shapes of the stormy deep we play, We come, for we know the sounds that ride Through the howl of the wind and the sweep of the tide.â THE MONKEYS There is a love that lights the eye, And flashes on the brow, Its music is a whispered word, Its seal a burning vow. There is a love that hides his torch Beneath the rosy bowl; And when the wine has passed the lip He warms the reveller's soul. There is a love that only comes When joy and hope have flown, And on the ruins of the past He builds his lonely throne. There is a quiet sort of love That comes to later years; When men have sighed away their sighs, And wept away their tears. But not the love that speaks in words, Or in the wine-cup burns, Nor that when memory's silent step To pleasure's grave returns,â And not the love that dotards feel Creep through their shivering veins,â Is like the love these sweet ones felt On Asia's scorching plains. Oh could she speakâshe cannot speakâ And what have words to tell? The trembling handâthe blushing cheekâ He reads their language well. The palms around their cradle rocked, The streams beneath it rolled; They swept through leaves of orient die, They tossed on sands of gold. The earth was green, the skies were bright, The air was sweet with sound, While thousand birds with painted wings, Made melody around. There are two little grassy mounds, And sleeping side by side, Lie buried in the cold damp earth The monkey and his bride! Oh, it was ever so with loveâ The flower that Eden gaveâ That where it rose in freshest glow, Beneath it lay the grave! THE DEPARTURE She turned, and sought the rock once more, She heared the distant parting hail, And sat her sadly on the shore To watch the lessening sail; It was a bitter thing to start The slumbers of the dreaming heart, To break its yet unsevered chain, And know it might not meet again. She loved him from a very child, With all the love that children feel, When streams that deepen as they flow, From nature's fountain steal; When hopes with yet unbroken wing Rise freshest from the dews of spring, And thoughts that would alone be cold, Grow warmer in their mutual fold. Could he forget her? was there aught In sea or earth, in time or space? How could he find another home Amidst the stranger race? And would he look in brighter eyes Lit by the sun of southern skies, And smile to think his heart was free From her who wept beyond the sea? She did not ask to hear of him, But when her daily toil was done,â She lingered by the darkening wave Beneath the setting sun; They deemed her happy, for she smiled As idly as a dreaming child, And looked as she had never known The sorrow that she mused alone. Go to the cottage by the cliff, If you have never been before, And kiss the little blushing girl That meets you at the door; And if you wish to know the tale, How changed the cheek that once was pale, A rosy boy, with curling hair, Will tell you all the story there. THE FISH PIECES Oft have I marked a pale, thin manâ âI would not here reveal his nameâ But I have seen him sadly turn From gaudy hues and gilded frame, And stand in silence, hour by hour Until his gazing eye was dim, And look, and look, till fancy seemed To fry those very fish for him. And sometimes he would wildly glance Upon the martyr's fiery bed, And I could see that yearning thoughts Flashed fiercely through his aching head; Well could I see his trembling hand Was carving out a fancied sliceâ Well did I know his busy brain Thought that the broiling saint looked nice. I could not bear to see him walk Among the fluttering summer things That float along the silent floor, And spread their little painted wings. What were to him the Sunset Scenes, Or soft Madonna's drooping hair? Can ringlets bind the breaking heart? Can hunger feed on golden air? I pitied him, for he was poorâ I loved him, for he was aloneâ The man who wears a threadbare coat Is seldom sought, and little knownâ Alas! I saw his pallid cheek Each day grow thinner than before; There was a funeral Friday nightâ That pallid cheek is seen no more! THE GIPSY Being, alas! thy boy forbids That I should call thee maidâ Thou seemest like the summer flower, The child of light and shade; I would not have thee veil thy brow, Nor bind thy streaming hair,â Soft falls the sun-beam through the trees, Light breathes the gentle air. The arching forest twines its arms Above thy houseless head, And clasping vines, and bending grass Beneath thy steps are spread. And fruits that ask not stooping toil Are all around thee piledâ So Nature spreads her downy wing To shield her simple child. Long ere the gilded palace shone, Or sprang the marble dome, The pillars of the forest rose, And there was woman's home; All that her untaught wishes asked, The field and mountain gave, She only claimed from mortal hands A cradle and a grave. Let luxury swathe her pallid child In purple and in gold, And wrap the breast that faintly beats Beneath its silken fold; Though she may wreath the languid forms That round her altar bow, Thou canst not see the hidden thorns That rend her votary's brow. Live as thou artâif soft and clear The rippling surface glide, Ask not to feel the deeper streams That freeze beneath the tide; If thought can breathe amidst the wild,â If passion there can burn, Read what the light of Heaven may teach, And wish no more to learn. Yes, they might train thine artless steps, And deck they brow with pearls, And weave the spoils of farthest earth Among thy raven curls; But they will see thee waste away, Nor heed thy fading bloom, And heartless mirth, and sullen guilt Will trample on thy tomb. Go slumber on the eagle's cliff Or in the lion's lairâ Sin has not sought the desert cave, Or stained the mountain air; But turn thee from the tainted crowd, Thy wilds are still the same, Nor blight thy yet unsullied heart With aught of earthly shame. LADY DRINKING The creature knoweth every shape, And taketh every name, But in every form, and every hue, The creature is the same; The morning drop, and the evening dram, And the noontide glass, he fills,â And you see his face unceasingly, Like a dun, in the time of bills. He slides into the soldier's lips From the mouth of a snug canteen; The drum may beat, and the gun may flash, But the creature slips between; He smooths the couch of the weary man, And diddles the sleeper's brain, And with the ray of the breaking day, The creature is there again. The maiden sits on her silken seat, And sips the cordial fair, And the blush grows deeper on her cheek For the spite is lurking there; The deacon walks to the tavern bar, And calls for a portion thin,â But he slily winks to the waiting-boy, And he pours the creature in. He clears the frog from the preacher's throat, And he helps the clerk to sing; And whets the scythe of the mowing man, In the shape of a mighty sling; He lends a tongue to the speechless one, And a flash to the coward's eye; He burns in a kiss on the lady's lip, And melts in the lover's sigh. The farmer fills his tumbler up And clasps his fingers round; He says not a word, but he drains the cup, For the creature there is found. In the morning mist, and the scorching sun, And the chill of the evening air; In the crystal glass and the earthen mug, The creature still is there. THE GRADUATE'S SONG It's I that is a bachelor, though married to the Muse, I talks with all the gentlefolks, and flirts with all the blues; It's I that looks as knowing now as any body can, For once I was a Sophomore, but now I am a man. I quotes the ancient classicals, I knows the newest tunes, I wears a coat that's elegant, and stripÃ©d pantaloons; It's I that has the shiny boots, and sports the spotted gills, It's I that drinks the Burgundy, and never pays my bills. I keeps a little puppy dog, I has a little cane, I beaus the pretty virgins out and beaus them home again; It's I that pins their handkerchiefs, it's I that ties their shoes, It's I that goes a shopping for to tell them what to choose. Who should it be, of all the world, who should it be but I, That writes the pretty poetry what makes the women cry? I sees the people stare at me, because I looks so fine, I loves the fat old grocer men, what asks me out to dine. I knows a little Latin stuff and half a line of Greek, My barber is a Frencher man, he taught me how to speak; It's I that makes the morning calls, it's I goes out to tea, O dear! you never saw a man one half so cute as me. MOONSHINE âOh leave me, leave me, foolish youth, And come not here again, Thy vows are wasted on the wind, Thy prayers are all in vain.â âLady, thy bird is singing sweet; Thou heedest not his lay, But wouldst thou not remember him If he should fly away?â âO, there is many another bird, That sings as sweet as he, Sir, And they shall have his golden cage, And they will sing to me, Sir.â âBut who shall make them come to thee, And who shall make them stay? No, lady, thou must live alone, When he has flown away.â âO fiddle, fiddle, Florio, You're but an ugly fowl, Sir, I mean to catch a nightingale, And do not want an owl, Sir.â âThen fare thee well, my lady love, Since all our ties must sever, I go to find a maid more kind, Then fare thee well for ever.â âO silly, silly Florio, I meant no such a thing, dove; There's not a bird, in all the world, So pretty as a ring-dove.â OCTOSYLLABICS A gentle eve! the earth and air, As fainting from the noontide glare, Are stealing slowly from the light, Beneath the raven wings of night; Yet see beyond their half-shut fold One long, bright lance of burning gold; And glancing in the yellow ray, The banners of retreating day. I hear the trembling ripples creep Along the bosom of the deep; As ocean curls its silver sheet, To kiss the zephyr's flying feet. âYes, all is fair, and I could deem That truth was in the ancient's dreamâ Hark! was there not a voice that came, From yonder rolling orbs of flame, Soft stealing with its solemn chime, Through all the din of earth and time? âThere may be moments when the sound We hear not, though 't is ever roundâ The anthem of the ringing spheres, Can stir the sense of mortal ears. The infant sleeps and smilesâwho knows What music lulls his light repose? The martyr smiles while demons drain The life-blood from the shrinking vein, The flame may scorch, the steel may tear, The quivering source of life lie bare; Why starts he from his bed of fire As if he heard an angel's lyre? O who can tell what heavenly strain Sheds rapture on the couch of pain? âAnd will no mermaid from her cave, Lift her soft bosom through the wave? Was all the wild Achaian told, Of silken hair and scaly fold, Of lonely wanderers to the shore Who saw, and heard, and came no more, An idle poet's empty tale, To make the shepherd's cheek turn pale? âA vanished dream! the time has been, When spirits trod the nightly green, When rocks, and waves, and hills, and plains, Were vocal with aerial strainsâ And are they gone who poured the breath Of life, upon the lips of death; Who peopled earth, and sea, and sky, With things that were too fair to die? All, all, are gone; creation's prime, Unsullied by the touch of time, The earth's first transient morning flush, The star's first glow, the flower's first blush, They saw; but all has past away, All save the legend and the lay. âAnd though Philosophy has rent The gorgeous veil which fancy lentâ Though now no more its mystic shroud Floats round us like a purple cloudâ Though the cold sages of the schools Have swathed all earth in laws and rules, And Nature like an athlete stands, Bound in the web of subtle handsâ Who does not love to think of hours, When every limb was robed in flowers? âBut now, with long and sullen sweep, The wind is rising on the deep; And Ocean flings his hoary locks In ringlets on the broken rocks. Is there no Nautilus to guide His pearly skiff along the tide With varnished beak and snowy sail, To cut the wave, and court the gale? âNot on those chill and frozen seas Spreads he his wings before the breeze, Where winds that howl and waves that roar Clash onward to the frozen shoreâ Go to the ice-bound Alps and seek The myrtle on the glacier's peak, But think not vainly here to find The shapes that woo the spicy wind Where one eternal summer smiles On crystal seas and emerald isles. Where Spring sits shuddering as she wears The belt of buds that winter tears, Think not that Nature binds with pearls Her iron brow and sable curls. âFarewell, wide Oceanâwhere I stand Soon shall thy billows sweep the sandâ Where late the noiseless sea-bird crept, Where insects shut their wings and slept, Thy beating surge and dashing spray Shall rend the living rocks away. THE OLD GENTLEMAN'S STORY âWhere hast thou been, thou grey-beard Time, For this full many a year; Art thou not tired, thou stiff old man, With running far and near?â He leaned upon his rusty scythe, And shook his hour-glass sands, And pointed to his worn-out shoes, And to his sun-browned hands; âLord bless you, master, no,â said he, âI've been upon the goâ I've lost my reckoningâbut about Six thousand years or so; âAnd what with mowing this and that, And weeding here and there, If I should tell you all I've done, Perhaps 't would make you stare. âI visit cities now and then, And dig beneath their walls, And owls and bats, and snakes and rats Are nestling in their halls. âI saw the conqueror when he came Fresh from the crimsoned plain; The rabble rout I heard them shout, Says I, âI'll call again.â âI'm something of a wag, and so When all had past away I groped about among the weeds To where the warrior lay. âWith bony finger, in the dust, That crusted on the tomb, I wroteââyoung gemman, I can writeâ THIS IS THE HERO'S DOOM.â âThey were big fellows, them that lived Five thousand years ago; 'T would take six dozen men like you To make one's little toe. âIt used to be tough mowing then; But now you've got so small I only crack you up like fleas And never mow at all. âBut, oh, the women plague me so! I'm sure I cant tell how; But they have posed me ever since I set to work till now. âAs fast as I can pull them down, So fast again they build; As fast as I can tear away, So fast the place is filled. âThere's Azurina's yellow locks, I've worked from day to day, With all my pains, to save my soul, I could not turn them gray. âI've bent the stubborn forest oak, That stood against the storm, But tried in vain, these forty years, To crook Flirtilla's form. âThey cheat the whale, they chouse the dead, They go from sea to skies, They catch the May-dew from the cloud, And gouge the oyster's eyes. âI make a bonfire now and then, And light it with a puff; Old songs, old stories, old reviews, And all that sort of stuff. âPoorâgoes to Helicon, To fill his brazen cup, It's dreadful milk-and-water like, But I shall drink it up. âWhere's that there magazine, d'ye think, That people lately read? I swallowed thatâverse, prose, and all, The feathers and the lead. âI've tried my styptics long enoughâ This scribbling is no crime, It's nothing but a new diseaseâ Incontinence of rhyme. âWhatever food the victims take, They can not hold it long, Murder and marriage, birth and death, All dribble out in song. âYoung man, I have some jobs to do, And must be going nowââ He raised his meagre hand and wrote A wrinkle on my brow. âThere, take my card, I always leave Them tokens when I call, I've known you, master, many a year For all you look so small.â THE TAIL-PIECE For The Collegian Kind world, sweet world, on every earthly shore, From Boston's dome to China's porcelain tower, We bend our knee in lowly guise once more, To ask a blessing on our parting hour. Our bud was nursed in Winter's tempest roar, The dews of spring fell on the opened flower; The stem is snapped, and blue-eyed Summer sees Our lilac leaflets scattered to the breeze. No more we float upon the tide of time, That fills the chalice of the star-girt moon; The sober essay and the sounding rhyme Are as the echoes of a ceasing tune; From neighboring village and from distant clime, From bare-walled study and from gay saloon, We softly sink to dark oblivion's shade, Unwept, unblest, unhonored, and unpaid. The vagrant printer may resume his quill, To scribble school-boy on the nameless tomb; The hard-eyed pedant call us, if he will, Precocious children, nursed to fruitless bloom; The sad subscriber eye his tardy bill, And knit his brows in unavailing gloomâ The printer's satire and the pedant's frown, The debtor's sigh, we swallow boldly down. But thou, sweet maiden, as thy fingers turn The last poor leaf that claims thine idle glance, If there was aught to feel or aught to learn In ode or treatise, vision, dream, or trance,â If the cold dust of the neglected urn Has ever warmed thee, by some happy chance, Should aunts look grim, or fathers shake the head, Plead for the harmless ashes of the dead. Ethereal being, thou whose melting eye Looks down like heaven where'er its glances fall, On noiseless slipper, gliding softly by, So sweetly drest, so proper, and so tall, The dew-fed offspring of the summer sky, Beau, critic, poet, soldier, each and all, From the dormeuse, where thy soft limbs recline, Sigh out a requiem o'er our broken shrine. The fire is outâthe incense all has fled; And will thy gentle heart refuse to grieve? Forget the horrors of the cap-crowned head, The fatal symbol on a student's sleeve, Think that a boy may grow if he is fed, And stroke us softly as we take our leave; Say we were clever, knowing, smart, or wise, But do say something, if you d?n our eyes. Ye who have shrunk not, dangerous though it seem, To lay your hands on yet unlaureled brows, If e'er we meetâand frown not if we deem Fame yet may smile on boyhood's burning vowsâ Bound in the garlands that we fondly dream May yet be gathered from Parnassian boughs; Yours be the praise, who led our doubtful way, Till harmless Hatred threw his brick away. Perchance we greet you, not as late we came, In meagre pamphlet, bound in flimsy fold, But from a page that bears a prouder name, With silken covers and with edge of gold; Look then in kindness on our higher claim And bid us welcome as ye did of old; So may your lives in pleasure glide along, Rich as our prose, and sweeter than our song. Peace with you allâthe summer sun will rise Not less resplendent that we are no more; The evening stars will gird the arching skies, The winds will murmur, and the waters roarâ Our faded way is lost to mortal eyes, Our wave has broken on the silent shoreâ One whisper rises from the weeping sprayâ Farewell, dear readersâand be sure to pay. CONFESSIONS OF A COCOANUT Far from these shores where sweeps the tempests' wing, And winter tramples on the flowers of spring, There rose a Palm upon the mountain's browâ My infant cradle was its topmost bough. Day smiled upon me with its eye of blue, And Evening fed me with her fragrant dew; The howling blast that chills your mother air, Dies to a Zephyr ere it whispers there; Your clouds, that frown from many a sable fold, Melt into air or brighten into gold. There had I lived, through changing sun and shade, And known no grief but what myself had made. How can I bear unshrinking to proclaim The tale that scorches like the breath of shame? Spare, gentle maiden, spare a wretch the pain That wakes a pulse in every withered veinâ Yet to conceal is harder than to tellâ I pined for freedomâbroke my stemâand fell.â âForgive my tearsâI will not ask of thee To track my wandering through the restless sea; Those days have pastâbut still the sounds of fear Ring wild and maddening on my dying ear. When the strained ship stood tottering on the wave An atom hanging o'er a boundless grave, The tossing billow and the deafening roar Yet thrill and echo on the silent shore.â âAnd must I tell the petty griefs that wind Their serpent coils around the prostrate mind; How long, in contact with the meaner hoard, I lay unpurchased on the huckster's board, Watched by the knave, and stared at by the fool, And eyed by children as they passed from school; How ladies ogled, and how servants sighed, With look all wistful and with mouth all wideâ How the thin dandy in his tailor's coat, Felt in his pockets, guileless of a groat; How lawyers saw me with dilated eye, Too proud to cheapen, and too poor to buy; How doctors blessed me, as the welcome sign Of sickly seasons, when the doctors dine, And fancy smiled at heaps of coming ills, And viewed with joy my progeny of pills; How sage old women called me worse than lead, How witlings laughed and thought of ?'s head; The skull so thickâthe hair so sadly thinâ All hard without, but oh! how soft within! âBut all is overâevery shade is past, Here I have rolled to die in place at last. No vulgar parent watched my opening bloomâ No host Plebian dared to seal my doom. The early radiance of my native skies Once more is kindled in thy beaming eyes. Longâlong hath ceased the wild-bird's melting strainâ I hear thee speakâits music breathes againâ My woes are ended, and my tale is o'er Thy lip shall press me, and I ask no more. THE GALLOWS BIRD'S LAST SONG Good people, listen unto me, I'm going for to sing; Tomorrow on the gallows tree I'm going for to swing; I always was a modest man, They shouldn't treat me so, To stick me on a scaffolding When people are below! I can't just tell where I was born, And don't a great deal careâ If men get well into the world It's no great matter where: And I've forgot the fellow's name, That took me to be bredâ I only know he pulled my ears, And so I broke his head. It makes me sad to speak of themâ Those loved and cherished ears; They've been upon the pillory These many, many years: It pained me much to part with them, Such long and faithful friendsâ And so I took the Mayor's horse, To make myself amends. The constables came after me, And took me up one day: They tied my hands and called me namesâ But then I got away. To say I stoleâit made me feel Unutterable grief, And so I robbed upon the road, To show I wan't a thief. They're going to hang me for it now And this is all I've got For standing like a gentleman The risk of being shotâ To have a fellow paw my neck, And fix it in a stringâ And I a hearty ladâit seems A devilish paltry thing. They're waiting for me to be dished, Like flocks of carrion crows; The doctor wants my skeleton, The jailor wants my clothes; The hangman has been practising How slip-knots should be tied; The tanner made a morning callâ I think he wants my hide! They've put me in a picture book, The likeness isn't trueâ My eyes were never goggle eyes, My nose is not askewâ And here's the sheriff at the door, I wish they'd let me beâ It may be pleasant work to themâ It isn't fun to me! REFLECTIONS IN A BALL ROOM Young manâmy neighbour on the right No doubt you think you're fine Your coat's a very proper coat, Your boots and buttons shine, And if you'd only hold your tongue You'd be a harmless flat, But talking to that pretty girl! What would the man be at? Young MissâI like your curling hair, I love your melting eyes, But was that last remark you made So very, very wise? I know you have a feeling heart, But don't you think it's queer To look so sweet and languishing On such a fool, my dear? Old gentlemanâI know you have A golden headed cane, And what if you should take it up And sally out again? The night, my friend, is very warm, The room is very full, And those long stories that you tell, Old gentleman, are dull. I hear the gentle waiter's step! I see the salver's gleam! There is a joy in frosted cakeâ A rapture in a cream; I go to join the gathering crowd, And thus I leave the hall. O many heart is bounding high, But mine the most of all! THE TWO SHADOWS It was an evening calm and fair As ever drank the dews of June; The living earth, the breathless air Slept by the shining moon. There was a rudely woven seat That lay beneath a garden wall,â I heard two voices low and sweet, I saw two shadows fall. Two shadowsâside by side they were, With but a line of light between; If shapes more real lingered there, Those shapes were all unseen. The voice which seemed of deepest tone Breathed something which I scarcely heard; And there was silence, save alone One faintly whispered word. And then the longer shadow drew Nearer and nearer, till it came So close, that one might think the two Were melting to the same. I heard a sound that lovers knowâ A sound from lips that do not speak; But oh! it leaves a deeper glow Than words upon the cheek. Dear maiden, hast thou ever known That sound which sets the soul on fire? And is it not the sweetest tone Wrung from earth's shattered lyre? Alas! upon my boyish brow, Fair lips have often more than smiled; And there is none to press it now, I am no more a child. Long, long the blended shadows lay As they were in a viewless fold; And will they never break away, So loving, yet so cold! They say that spirits walk the vale, But that I do not truly knowâ I wonder when I told the tale, Why Fanny crimsoned so! CROSSING THE FORD Clouds, forests, hills and waters!âand they sleep As if a spirit pressed their pulses down,â From the calm bosom of the waveless deep Up to the mountain with the sunlit crown, Still as the moss-grown cities of the dead, Save the dull plashing of the horse's tread. And who are they that stir the slumbering stream? Nay, curious reader, I can only say That, to my eyes of ignorance, they seem Like honest rustics on their homeward way; There is a village; doubtless thence they came; There was a christening; and they have a name. They are to us, like many a living form, The image of a moment, and they pass Like the last cloud that vanished on the storm, Like the last shape upon the faithless glass; By lake, or stream, by valley, field, or hill, They must have lived; perchance are living still. DOMESTIC THOUGHTS Nay, do not talk my worthy aunt, Young eyes will never mind you, A sober look before your face, A stolen glance behind you; Young Love will have his doublet on, Before old care can waken, And they who count on saintly ways, Are apt to be mistaken. No doubt she thinks you passing wise, As often as you warn her, And hides the mischief in her eyes, Till you are round the corner; And looks so honest, when you chance To find us both together, And makes such very prim remarks About the pleasant weather! If you had seen two quiet hands That were together folded, And known who stole your spectacles, No doubt you would have scolded; Or if you'd heard some words that passed When you were standing near usâ I plugged your trumpet, auntie dear, And so you could not hear us! The dear old lady! so she shall, Enjoy herself in trying, To cut away poor Cupid's plumes, And spoil his wings for flying; But clip them very, very close, For if you leave a feather, One quill will write a billet-doux, And off we go together! THE FLIES The flies! the flies! the whizzing flies! Those little dragon things! The air is Babel with their sounds And twilight with their wings. There's one is buzzing in my ear, And one above my eyeâ AhâI have got him in my handâ That miserable fly! Thump! there's your gruel, honest friendâ Smash! how's your liver now? Aha! my fingers, worthy bugs, Are devils in a row. Keep off, keep off, blue-bottle fly, With your asthmatic hum, You're mighty loving with my nose, You would not like my thumb. Stop, let him crawl a little way, There,ânow if you must go Just be so good as leave in pawn A dozen legs or so. Well, really now, my pretty pet I fear I've hurt your head I'm sorryâbut we all must dieâ The little whelp is dead. Hand me the tongsâthey come, they come Like pecks of living hail; O Lord Monboddo, bless your soul. I wish I had a tail. INFELIX SENECTUS To see an old and gray haired man, It always makes me sad; For whyâI shall grow old myself That am so stout a lad. What if one takes the portly turn, And swells, and puffs, and grows, Who does not hate your walking whale, Your full blown human rose? Alas! a little dapper man, May come to weigh a tonâ The pantaloons of twenty-two, Are tights at forty-one! And then to think of getting thin, Is bad as bad can be; Your eagle nose your salient chin, Are shocking things to me. I'm not a baby or an ass, But yet my soul it shocks, That time should whittle down my legs, And pick my golden locks. Some decent calves are made of corkâ They're awkward in a boot; Some decent periwigs are boughtâ They're slow at taking root. Noâlet me weep, I cannot bear The wasting hand of years; O were there nothing else to shed, I would not grudge my tears. SONG OF THE HENPECKED O her hair is as dark as the midnight wave, And her eye is like kindling fire, And her voice is sweet as the spirit's voice That chords with the seraph's lyre. But her nails are as sharp as a toasting fork, And her arms as strong as a bear's; She pulled my hair, and she gouged my eye, And she kicked me down the stairs. I've got me an eye that's made ofâglass, And I've got me a wig that's new,â The wig is frizzled in corkscrew curls, And the eye is a clouded blue. She may shake her knuckles full in my face, And put the lamp to my beard, And hold the broomstick over my head,â But I am not a bit afeard. For I've bound her over to keep the peace, And I've bought me a crabtree cane,â The justice will come, and the constable too, If she meddles with me again. My head was a week in the linen cap. And my eye a month in the patch; I never thought that the torch of love Would light such a brimstone match! THE FAIRY WORLD There is a worldâa fairy world, That hath its place on common ground; In every spot, on every soil, Where man himself is found. Before our eyes, beneath our feet We see it, yet we coldly deem Its scenes but rainbow tinted air, Its life an idle dream. The fresh and bounding pulse that glows Along its yet unbroken course, Clear as the fountain of the Spring From its untainted source; And the glad freedom of the soul, Ere care has linked his leaden chain From fancy's tangled path of flowers To drag it back again; If this be life, and this is theirsâ The leaping pulse, the joyous eye, Why need they sigh that sterner cares Beyond their circle lie? It hath its laws and edicts stern, Its well tried maxims, worn and sage, Some from the grandam's reverend lip, And some from printed page. It hath its legends and its tales, The records of departed time; Its wondrous stories grave and true, Its rudely woven rhyme; Its fabled heroes, crowned kings, Its warriors fierce, its giants tall; Its wizards, and its charmÃ©d maid, She of the sandal small. It hath its customs, gray with years, Saved from the crumbled spoils of yore, When northern wanderers moored their barks Along the Saxon's shore. It changeth not where all is changed, Though monarchs fall, and empires fade, Still springs it, like the vine beneath The dying forest's shade. Child of the round and rosy cheek, The laughing lip, the clustering hair, Thine is the world of which we speak, Hope, peace, and joy are there. THE LOST BOY How sweet to boyhood's glowing pulse The sleep that languid summer yields, In the still bosom of the wild, Or in the flowery fields! So art thou slumbering, lonely boyâ But ah! how little deemest thou The hungry felon of the wood Is glaring on thee now! He crept along the tangled glen, He panted up the rocky steep, He stands and howls above thy head, And thou art still asleep! No trouble mars thy peaceful dream; And though the arrow, winged with death, Goes glancing near thy thoughtless heart, Thou heedest not its breath. Sleep on! the danger all is past, The watch-dog, roused, defends thy breast, And well the savage prowler knows He may not break thy rest! TO THE LADY OPPOSITE I wish the girl would move awayâ Why need she all the while Sit beaming at her window seat With that eternal smile? 'Tis very strange, and very odd, And very like a plan, With such a look and such an air And I a single man! There sat she like a seraph chained In morning's earliest flame, And there she leaned upon her hand When crimson sunset came, And there she was at twilight hourâ I saw the shutters close, How slowly as with vain regret They folded up my rose! I know her mother thinks it wrongâ I know mama is rightâ I know a matron and a maid Declare she is a frightâ I know what many folks would thinkâ I know what some will sayâ I know all this, and yet, ah yet I cannot keep away. And I will sit, mysterious maid, And watch by morning sun, And fondly gaze through mist and shade When the fair day is done, And love the lipsâthe rosy lips That ne'er to me have spoken, And wear the chain that silence wove And words have never broken. CITY MADRIGALS Come out ye cockney gentlemen, The ladies all are out, And rustling silks and nodding plumes Are flashing all about, The street is like a tulip bed, The clock has just struck one, Come out ye cockney butterflies And flutter in the sun. Come out ye pasteboard Romeos That strut before the scenes, Come out ye pallid collegers That write in Magazines, Come out ye tarnished veterans That always take the wall, Ye stylish men, ye decent men, Ye shabby men and all! Thou who dost shun the constable, And look from side to side, Who goest not by Congress street Where tailors do abide, Thou needst not fear the constable Thou shalt not meet the dun No catchpole prowls to take thee here No tailor walks at one. The maids of the metropolis Have robed their snowy arms And Beacon street and Common street Have emptied all their charmsâ Come out ye cockney gentlemen While flush the cheeks of Spring And beauty's birds of Paradise Are all upon the wing! TO MY NEIGHBOUR WHO SINGS, AND PLAYS ON THE PIANO-FORTE Touch the notes lightly, fellow, one who dares To paw so like a rampant catamount But wrongs the gentle soul of Harmony. Thou canst not bastinado into voice Her light ethereal essenceâshe will breathe, When fairy fingers light like falling leaves Upon her couch of slumber, sweetest sounds; But thouâO think of thine unwieldly hands And use them sparelyâsilence is not woe. âI would not blame thee for thy scorn of time Yet for the sake of my most ancient friend Time in the primer, I have love for him. Some men have ears and some they say have noneâ I do not mean the base external flaps, For all have these, and some exceeding longâ But the nice inward feeling of the soul. Well art thou garnished with those outward signs! Ill art thou furnished with that inner sense! âKing have been soothed by music. There are times When one whose hand is whiter than a pearl Whose voice is clearer than a wild bird's trill Has sung unto me till her tones like light Have sunk into the stream of common thoughts And made it bright as visionsâbut for thee When the hoarse murmur of thy gurgling bass Cracks into wild falsettoâI am wont To say bad words that honesty forbids And have black fancies threat'ning thee with ill. âI have no hatred for theeâI am one Who loves mankind because he is a man; And were thy music wasted like the winds Will all the air were echo, so that I Were blest with deafness, I would only smile. Or would'st thou sit upon a lonely rock And raise thy tumult of unearthly sounds If all the mermaids tore their ocean pearls From their wet locks and flung them at thy feet, I would not envy thee a single gem. âAnd now when thou shalt see my simple lines With these three poor initials at their foot Let not thy temper like the porcupine Start into rigid bristlesâbut be calm. Remember that I love theeâO remember That if I did address thee half unkindly The mingled torrent of thy crash and screams Fast then was bursting fresh upon my ear; But now my sense is palsiedâI have learned To look upon thee as an erring man More than a sinning, and I wish thee well. LOVE-SONG Hast thou a look for me, love? A glance is lightly given; Though small the cost to thee, love, To me it may be heaven. Hast thou a smile for me, dear? One smile may chain a rover; A laughing lip, a flashing eye, And Love's first page turns over. Hast thou a word for me, love? Why not a soul is near thee; And there is none that will betray, And only one to hear thee. Hast thou a kiss for me, dear? O spoil it not by keeping, For cheeks will fade, and hearts grow cold, While youth and joy are sleeping. TO FAME They say thou hast a hundred tongues; My wife has only one; If she had been equipped like thee, O, what should I have done! The Echo Nay, dearest stranger, do not shout; My wife has worn the echo out. TO A LADY WITH HER BACK TO ME I know thy face is fresh and bright, Thou angel-moulded girl; I caught one glimpse of purest white, I saw one auburn curl. O would the whispering ripples breathe The thoughts that vainly striveâ She turnsâshe turns to look on me; Black! cross-eyed! seventy-five! THE DESTROYERS Sow thick thy flowerets, gentle Spring! The soil is ghastly bare, And pour from every balmy leaf Thy sweetness on the air; Ay, wrap the hills and vales in green, Waste all thy perfumed breath. The mould is black with crumbling shapes, The winds are damp with death. Soft as a kiss on lady's cheek, The ripples touch the shore; Tomorrow, and the strangling shriek Shall swell the billow's roar. And many an eye that maiden loves. The rolling wave shall close, And lips that children weep to hear, Lie sealed in long repose. The scorching sunbeam sears the field That gleamed with Autumn's gold, And dying mothers bare their breasts To babes whose lips are cold. By night the livid Plague went by, Scarce was a leaflet stirredâ Whence came that lone and smothered cry? Why screams the carrion bird? And, thou, the parent and the tomb, That rocks and shrouds us all, Whose bosom warms our growing limbs And veils them when they fall,â Beneath the bounding foot of life Heaves up thy bursting soil, And Pleasure's wreath is rank and green, Gorged with thy loathsome spoil. The eagle sits upon his cliff, And watches for the dead; The worm is coiled beneath the sod, The slumberer's dreamless bed; The shark is swimming in the wakeâ None, none shall lose his claim; Four hands have spread the banquet boardâ Earth, Ocean, Air, and Flame! THE TOAD AND THE NIGHTINGALE I cannot say if truth there be In that fantastic tale About the bargain made between The toad and nightingale;â But thou,âif thou hast ever called One heavenly gift thine own,â Hast let it go, and kept unsold Thine ugliness alone. O would the blazing chandelier, That lights each hideous line, But save its rays for eyes that beam And cast its shade on thine! O would the laboring echoes cease Thine accents to repeat! Thou wert in shadow doubly fair, In silence doubly sweet! WORDS TO WOMAN Now, Lady fair, whoe'er ye be, List for a little space to me; A little space; I hold it crime To clip the skirts of lady's time. And who is he, saith many a dame, That urges thus his idle claim? Say, are the eyes his soul looks through The true poetic patternâblue? And is his talk of groves and bowers? And are his pockets filled with flowers? And is he famous? has he been Engraved on stone, like him of Lynn? A fiddlestick, romantic maid, For all your symbols of the trade; As Heaven has made me, so am I, And Heaven knew best the how and why; And as for fame, my neighbors say Some flattering things across the way, And in the papers far and wide I've seen my linesâbut this aside. Then, Lady, list; the swallow's wing Is dripping with the dews of spring, And down my alley, dark and blind, One sprig, survivor of its kind, Comes bristling up the stones between, So thin, so crooked and so green, Like the last virgin left alone Of seven sweet daughters wooed and won. All thoughts, all looks, all words, all eyes, Are softening like the gentle skies; And many a lip, that whispered âNo,â Is wondering why it answered so; For ice, that scorned December's noon, Melts ere it feels the breath of June; And Oh, when Heaven is warm above, The heart,âthat pendulum of loveâ Beats faster, as if Time were seeing Its sweet intensity of being. Yes, spring has comeâwith all her train, Green leaves, and âcuttie sarks,â again, As if to make us all believe Earth paradise and woman Eve! Now then beware; a playful trip, A casual step, a careless slip, May chance to show the sun and air, What knights and ladies sometimes wear; A hint must serve us for the nonceâ And âhoni soit qui mal y pense.â To one whose path is bare and wildâ Who has no home, no wife, no child, Who, if he loves, must love alone Some dear abstraction of his own, Some truths may find their way more free Through the thin air of vacancy; To see the governor and his aid, One should not join the cavalcade. Women from two extremes incline Towards a faint dividing line, From her, whom nature stamped a prude, Up to theâ, fie, I can't be rude; The lemonade, and eau-de-vie, That make our punchâsociety. And each should play a different part, To find an entrance to the heart; What nature gave the one may hide, The other steal what she denied. Some borrowed glow, half-frozen maid, Will mellow down thy native shade; A rose, a ribband, and a curl Will make one's grandam seem a girl. But do not thou, luxuriant one, Lay bare thy richness to the sun. Not that my cheek is wont to burnâ I walk to stare and stare to learn; But she, whose touch all hearts must feel, Should wear no spur upon her heel! Alas, that she, whom Nature made, Whom Art has lent her liberal aid, In spite of all her power to bless, Should play the suicide in dress. Thin spectres, must ye ever strive To seem less palpably alive, Afraid, lest rebel planes should swerve And crack your buckram to a curve? Hebes, who deem your fortune hard, To buy your girdles by the yard, Is not your suffering worse than vain To make the zone a martyr's chain? Nor yet too brightly strive to blaze, By stealing all the rainbow rays; Your gaudy artificial fly, Will only take the younger fry. Who has not seen, and seeing, mourned, And mourning, smiled, and smiling, scorned, In wild ambition flaming down, Some comet from a country town? See, see her, in her motley huesâ Funereal blacks, and brimstone blues, And lurid green, and bonfire red, At once their varied radiance shed, And skin-deep gold, and would-be pearls, And Oh! those heaps of corkscrew curls! Sylph of Farina's best Cologne! Soft sighing from thy vapory throne, Breathe life into me when I swoon, Scared by the fiends that walk at noon! Sweet statue! classic, chaste and fair, Albeit cold and somewhat bare, Give back the stern simplicity That living woman gave to thee! Spirit of change! whose Iris wing Must shed its feathers every spring, Smile on the barks, whose bosoms bear All that fantastic France can spare! And what no parent can refuse, O give the daughters grace to use! SENTIMENT Alas! that in our earliest blush Our danger first we feel, And tremble when the rising flush Betrays some angel's seal! Alas! for care and pallid wo Sit watchers in their turn, Where heaven's too faint and transient glow So soon forgets to burn! Maiden, through every change the same Sweet semblance thou may'st wear; Ay, scorch thy very soul with shame, Thy brow may still be fair: But if thy lovely cheek forget The rose of purer yearsâ Say, does not memory sometimes wet That changeless cheek with tears? NEW YEAR'S ADDRESS One year, God bless You! quoth the man of rhyme, Is but a small parenthesis in time; It chimes with others, like a mingling tone; It hath its meaning though it stand alone. Trace the short seasons from the vernal cloud To where they slumber in their winter shroud; Within that circle every human dream Has flushed and faded like the planet's beam, All thoughts, all passions that shall ever glide Through living channels with their changeless tide, Have had their being, and are dimly cast In Memory's outline on the hueless past. Life's kindling torch, and Death's enveloped urn Receive the flame and ashes in their turn; Love doats and sickens; Anger frets and dies With every twinkle in the starry skies; And, as the wild autumnal winds that bear Earth's myriad foliage through the desert air, Time sweeps the trophies with his shriveled wings, Torn from the bosom of all breathing things. What if the tempest strike a deeper stain On the gray summit which it beats in vain? What if the cataract scoop the quivering rock A little deeper with its ceaseless shock? What if a nation change its badge or name, Is man, is nature, then, no more the same? Alas, poor drawler, throw the quill away That will be serious when it should be gay; Wrench a tough feather from some veteran bird! File into satire every iron word, Let the rank plume, for which the vulture bled, Drip scalding poison, and thou may'st be read; But keep thy wisdom, all its odds and ends, For blue-eyed misses and lymphatic friends. Spirit of Dulness! not for me alone Bends thy vague shadow from its leaden throne; Thy sceptre darkens o'er a wider reign Than the dull precincts of my wearied brain; Speak, prostrate Caesar, from thy school-boy page Green with the verdure of reviving age; The robe of empire cannot purple now The poppies shadowing thy patrician brow! We leave the follies of the passing year Save one too noisy for a quiet ear. What though it flourish o'er the astonished town, The saintly drapery of the prelate's gown; What though, great Ãolus, this gentle strain Shall make dull music for thine idiot brain; When the lost pilot steers the bark no more Well may the rhymester of a day deplore The freight of science, sinking fast from view, Swamped in the verbiage of her precious crew. Yet for the stranger, on whose lonely grave No flowers familiar to his childhood wave, In this frail record be one passing sigh Breathed o'er the darkness where his ashes lie. Oh if the errors could the wise beguile, Warmed by the magic of his winning smile, Be they forgotten, and above him bend Truth for her champion, Virtue for her friend. Hark! with the clarion that the storm has blown A southern trumpet blends its angry tone; See, with the drapery of the tattered sky, The nameless banner of a faction fly; Why breaks that menace on the peaceful breeze That wafts the treasures of an hundred seas? Why floats the shadow of that flag afar, Whose folds are blazoned with a falling star? Go to the chaos where creation lay Ere night receded from the shores of day, And ask the spirit, whose annulling glance Checked each abortion of eternal chance, Why Life was scattered, gathering into form, And Beauty smothered ere her lips could warm? Our last year's versesâwith paternal care We keep one copy for our unborn heirâ Touched but too lightly on the wasting flame Whose distant sparkles perished as they came. God of all judgements, how that awful word Has thrilled and trembled where it since was heard; Pale lips pronounced it at the morning's dawn; Those lips were silent ere the day was gone. As on the forest sinks the dewy cloud, Death fell and dampened on the shivering crowd; War's thunder threatens ere his arrows fly, And Famine whispers from her blazing sky: Thou hadst no herald till thy bursting waves Swept the shrunk victims to their shallow graves, Farewell, sweet reader; once the song I raised The Transcript quoted and the Courier praised. Ah, then no drudgery chained my buoyant mind, And thou, dear idol of my love, wast kind, Alas! these objects that around me gleam Like the red phial, in a druggist's dream; The bell that calls me from each nascent line, (Three strokes, O stranger, on that bell are mine;) And years, whose progress every bosom feels, Must wear the axle while it rolls the wheels, Shall plead for Freedom till this wreath of rhyme To-morrow tosses from the locks of Time. SIX VERSES I loved her, but there came a blight, That seared my brain and chilled my heart; I love her, yet I do not grieve That we are far apart. And still I hope, before I die, To look into her clear blue eye. I could not meet her in the place, Where once in better hours we met, And look unaltered in her face, Fresh in its beauty yet;â Nor speak unmoved the once loved name, Now burning with the brand of shame. The livid waves are murmuring low, The lightning sleeps in yonder cloud; But soon the rushing winds shall blow, And thunders rattle loud. O then, upon the shivering sea, I would I were alone with thee! Alone with theeâbut sea and air Should raise around the dirge of sin, And Memory's mocking lip lay bare Her poisoned pangs within; And tardy Vengeance come at last Upon the billow and the blast. Then shouldst thou see how sleepless wo Can scourge the lazy steps of time, And hear, in accents calm and low, The tale of buried crime. Thou, who my earliest love didst share, With me should dieâlike me despair. Yet when the walled and tottering waves Hung o'er us in their arching sweep, If I could hear one word of grief, For wrongs so dark and deep, Thou fiends had in thy bosom slept, I could but weep as once I wept. IV. THE HEART'S OWN SECRET 1855 [I, a poor actor, paid to please a throng,â] I, a poor actor, paid to please a throng,â Painted and plumed in all the pride of song; I, that have brought these mercenary strains Whose every couplet clanks its golden chains; I, self-enrolled among the shining set That outrage virtue with their âMuse to let;â Have I no visions, as again I rise And read my welcome in your waiting eyes? Fresh from the hills that feed with icy springs Rough brakes that rustle with the wild-bird's wings; From solemn woodlands where in awful shade, Heaped with green mounds, the forest kings are laid, While round their graves the bleeding maples flow, And mourning hemlocks droop in weeds of wo; From groves of glossy beech the wood thrush fills In the dim twilight with his rapturous trills; From sweet still pastures, cropped by nodding kine, Their noon-tide tent the century-counting pine; From the brown stream along whose winding shore Each sleepy inlet knows my resting oar; From the broad meadows, where the mowers pass Their scythes slow-breathing through the feathered grass; From tawny rye-fields, where the cradler strikes With whistling crash among the bearded spikes; Fresh from such glories, how shall I forget My summer's day-dream, now the sun is set? And ah! too well my burning cheek betrays I too have clasped the jewelled cup of praise; The cup, once tasted, like the reveller's draught, The lip still clings to, till its dregs are quaffed. These reverend sires, with wrinkled front severe, Fain would I win to pardon all they hear; These dry, hot souls, inflamed by angry tongues, Scorched with the furnace-blast from fiery lungs, With liquid verse I long to soothe and cool. And lead them, grateful, from its healing pool. These rose-lipped daughters of the younger time, Whose nicer ear is fed with daintiest rhyme, Whose youthful eyes, half-threatening while they shine, Must lend the light they cannot ask from mine. Still would I please, if yet the power remain; Say not, sweet listeners, that I long in vain! The Heart's own Secret! How a single word Would tell our history,âand we die unheard! When Love's dear witchery makes us more than kind; When Friendship lifts the flood-gates of the mind; When the red wine-cup brings its half-eclipse, And the heart's night-birds flutter round the lips; That single word the faithful traitors shun: Tell follies, sins, and secrets,âall but ONE. Behold the simple thread that intertwines Its sober strand along my pictured lines. [Pictures enough! 'Tis time the gallery close] Pictures enough! 'Tis time the gallery close; The slumbering nod, the waking need repose. Yet ere we rake the ashes on the coals, One brighter spark shall fire these wearied souls. The lonely man, whose story none could tell,â The knave, who kept his secret till he fell,â The lover's silent lip and wasting cheek,â The brooding mother's hope that would not speak,â The fevered statesman's soul-consuming dream,â Enough of these; I ask a loftier theme! Ye that proclaim the fierce destroyer's creed, Shut your white lips and listen while I read: âWhen tongues are fiery hot and hearts are cold, âWhen faith grows weak and faction waxes bold, âWhen the wise whisper and the fools are loud, âWhen every brawler has his noisy crowd, âWhen peaceful Abel leaves his fruits and grain âTo call hard names and shake his fist at Cain, âWhen gray old Judah casts his open vote âTo sell his brother in the patch-work coat, âShout, Despots, shout across the shuddering wave! âThe Sexton stands by Freedom's open grave!â Still let us hope!âWhat sudden mists arise And veil the shapes that filled my outward eyes? A vision floats before my dreaming soul;â A proud fair maiden clasps a mystic scroll; On hand is circled on a lofty spear, One foot is planted on a pictured sphere. âBehold!â she cries, âand tremble as ye read; âThis is the patriot's first and latest creed! âWo to the unborn children of the age âThat blots or rends its Heaven-emblazoned page!â Large is the scroll; its living lines how bright, As the long legend flashes in the light! O for one word! for those mysterious gleams Cheat my strained vision, as in midnight dreams. Spread the curled leaf that holds the solemn creed, Now, now, if ever, is the hour to read! The maiden smiles; a purple hem she tears And blinds it fluttering to the lance she bears. Borne on the quivering staff in upper air The winds unfold it, flowing broad and fair; See how it waves and widens! Now, behold! Rayed like the morning! Fired with spots of gold! I know the milk-white bandsâthe flaming barsâ My country's flag, with all its radiant stars! One hue it borrows from the tropic's rose, And one comes glistening from the polar snows, Forever braided, till the crownless Queen Sweeps with its folds the mighty world between!</field>
