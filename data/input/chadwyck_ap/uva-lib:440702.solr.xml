I've seen two tetchy school-boys fight, Till tears and blood obscured their sight; And then both enter their complaint, And Master with the fact acquaint, Who heard their stories long and ample, Then flogg'd them both for good example. Author's MS. “Mortals, avaunt!” ye biped race, Who boast an image, form, and face, Of stamp divine! no more for you I waste my breath and labor too; No more I sing to souls who scorn The warblings of my vocal horn, But wake for those the tuneful lay Who heard when Orpheus deign'd to play; Who, charm'd, forgot their native choler, And danced a hornpipe round Apollo. Yes, 'tis for you, untutored tribes, Whose plaudits are not won by bribes; If is for you, ye quadrup'd throng, That I invoke the muse of song; That Fancy now extends her wings And wantons o'er the silver strings. And thou, great Leo! deign to hear A strain unworthy of thine ear; Thou, from whose patriotic toil This Eden-realm receives its smile; Whose generous paw supplies with food Each den of misery in the wood; Who helps the weak, restrains the strong— O listen to my humble song! And while, from legal duties freed, Reclining on the enamel'd mead, Where flowery sweets obsequious sping— Accept the offering which I bring; Receive my tributary strain, And shake with joy thy shaggy mane, Then roar thy gracious plaudits round, Till distant echoes learn the sound. Her beastly theme the blushing muse Prays that its moral may excuse; For though her numbers may be rude, She means them for the public good. To lash the fiend of folly hence, Expose the abject slave of sense, Strip Virtue's garb from Vice's form, Screen innocence from slander's storm, Make mean revenge and malice know They slay themselves to wound their foe, Shall be the object of her story, Which dresses truth in allegory. In early ages, (long before Columbus sought the western shore) Ere art had stript the sylvan plain Beyond the Appalachian chain; Or man had taught the trade of blood To the wild tenants of the wood; Near where Missouri's fountains play, A Mammoth held his regal sway, As I expect all the Critics upon my back, I intend, if possible, to anticipate their attacks. I have already been quizzed upon my author's introducing a Mammoth on the stage, when he was an Arabian, and could never have heard of such an animal. But I hope the doubts of my readers, on this head, will be dispelled, on perusing the following brief sketch of the history of Sampfilius Philoerin, which I have hastily compiled from the folio Biography in my possession. Indeed, I had contemplated giving this interesting work to the public entire; but am now determined to decline it, until their patronage for the poem shall have convinced me they are deserving of such an exquisite treat. Sampfilius Philoerin was born in Arabia Felix, about the time that Cyrus had extended his conquests over all the kingdoms of the East. Sampfilius was a direct descendant, in the male line, of Ishmael, the son of Hagar, filie-de-chambre to the patriarch Abraham. He had the advantage of an excellent education, and early imbibed a thorough knowledge of mankind. His fables were comprised in twelve royal quarto volumes, and rendered him famous throughout the east before he was six years old; but these were “lost in the vortex of revolutions,” long before the art of printing was invented. Ere he attained the age of manhood, he became so disgusted with the despotism under which he existed, that he involved his whole family in ruin by too public an expression of his disaffection. Finding himself an outcast among his countrymen, and his very life in danger, he resolved on seeking his fortune in a foreign clime, and thus to gratify an inordinate thirst for travelling, which he had long cherished. He accordingly disguised himself in the habit of a wandering Arab, and commenced his new career amid dangers and difficulties, which a soul of inferior talents and firmness would have despaired of surmourning. After visiting every part of Asia, he found himself, at the age of forty, in the most north-eastern extremity of those inclement regions which have since become a portion of the Russian empire; and at length safely landed on the shores of this continent, on a cake of ice. Here he had to encounter fresh difficulties, and renew the fatigue of travelling over enormous mountains of ice and snow, some dozen times higher than the Andes, in search of a less frigid region, in which he might rest from the toils of a tour so unpleasant and unprofitable as the one in which, for twenty years, he had been thus engaged. At the end of about six months he attained his wish, and found himself on the fertile banks of the Mississippi, in the summer season. Here a new creation burst upon his enraptured view; and he almost imagined himself in the spicy groves of his native soil, inhaling the ambrosial fragrance of Arabia's odoriferous zephyrs. He soon learned that he was in the midst of an empire of civilized brutes, governed by a monarch, whose goodness was only equailed by his size. Here he resolved to fix his abode, and here he did in fact reside until the termination of his earthly existence. Previous to his death, he collected together his papers, and after destroying those which he thought of no consequence to some future age which he anticipated, he enclosed the remainder in a solid spar of crystal, and sunk them in the river on whose banks he expired. Centuries rolled away, and this virtuous race of animals gradually declined, giving place to a new order of beings, viz: the red men of the wood, who made it their business to extirpate, by every mean in their power, the former inhabitants of this sylvan paradise. The Mammoth king shared the common fate; and his bones are now exhibited in an European museum. About two months ago, as a boat was descending the Mississippi, one of the boatmen, a little elevated with whiskey, fell overboard, and went instantly to the bottom. His comrades, after a vast deal of difficulty, at length discovered the body, on the oozy bed of the river, clinging fast to the very spar of crystal above mentioned. In a few hours they succeeded in getting their companion, and the apparent object of his affection, out of the river. The man was dead; but the manuscripts of Sampfilius Philoerin were thus accidentally rescued from the waters of oblivion, for the applause of an admiring world. The papers being all written in Arabic, (mere heathen Greek to the boatmen) I had no difficulty in procuring them; and the spar of crystal is now deposited in the American Museum, kept by Mr. Scudder, in this city, where those who have the curiosity may examine it at their leisure. The above sketch is but the faint outlines of an enormous work, which, as I said before, I will not give the public, unless they pay me well for “Zoologian Jurisprudence,” which being the author's last production, will, I think, be a correct criterion by which the public may judge of his other works. With policy correct and mild, O'er every beast that trod the wild The last of all that mighty race Whose relics now manure the place. The monarch, in his great career, Confess'd no rival or compeer. His subjects view'd his matchless size, Which spurn'd the earth and sought the skies, And e'en the Lion stood in awe, And view'd askance his kingly paw. Where'er he moved, or south, or north He seem'd a mountain stalking forth; Whene'er he drank, the rivers fled, And Mississippi left her bed; But when obeying nature's whim, (For, just like us, she govern'd him) Again tho mighty borrowed floods Resumed their place, or drown'd the woods. The mountains tottered when he stept, And dew-drest forests, trembling, wept. Such was the Mammoth, when he bore The kingly rule, in days of yore; When savage tribes his power beheld And own'd him monarch of the field. Beneath his strict but gentle sway, His subjects seldom went astray; But beasts and birds enjoy'd repose, Secured alike from want and foes; In safety cropp'd the verdant blade, Or drank where gurgling streamlets stray'd; Whilst strict observance of the laws Their constitution kept from flaws; And none on flesh presumed to feed, Save when the law bade felons bleed; And then the court would never fail On such a banquet to regale. The Lion, prince of noble blood, Vicegerent of the kingdom stood; And, as became his royal port, The great high judge of every court. 'Twas his, unwarp'd by threats or bribes, To class the beasts in various tribes; Appoint their officers, to hold A guardian watch in every fold; And, where injustice took effect, The base procedure to correct. Vices, in these old-fashioned times, With vulgar brutes, were counted crimes; And chastity was understood As something laudable and good. The males (our legend further says) Were not such rakes as now-a-days: Through the whole of this Poem, Sampfilius seems to have been aware that he was not writing for the times in which he lived; but, with an eye to futurity, has taken particular care to suit his language to ours. Thus, a kiss, of which there is so much fuss made in this trial, conveys to our imagination (as the author intended) the mere joining of lips; but the beasts of his day had a very different mode of doing it, and one peculiar to themselves; but which was, nevertheless, for all the world, a bona fide KISS, and nothing less or more. The dog, for instance, ne'er went round To kiss each wanton slut he found, But to one mate each beast was stinted, And was, 'tis said, with one contented. Among the rest, a Mastiff, bold, Was stationed to protect a fold; From every dangerous foe to keep A thrifty flock of Goats and Sheep, Who had, for health and conscience's sake, Been cleanly wash'd in Eric's lake. While faithfully his post he kept, They fed secure, and safely slept; And ne'er was shepherd more revered, Beloved, and honored, by a herd. But while the trusty guardian grew In favor both with ram and ewe, A female Goat the Dog accuses, And swears that he his trust abuses; Which charge she pledges to support, When call'd upon, before the court. The jurors on the case confer, And find a bill against the Cur. 'Twas summer, and the world was gay, The zephyrs taught the leaves to play; The forest was arrayed in green, And feathered songsters charm'd the scene. The Lion on his couch reclined, (A mound of turf, with flowers behind) When Goat's petition was presented— The prince perused it, and consented His herald should a summons send That all the learned court attend: The Jackall the commission took, And at his call the forests shook. The court were now convened in state To enter on the grand Achate; And beasts and birds of every size Were throng'd around with staring eyes; The lordly Lion took the chair, Whose smile was hope, whose frown despair; Before the terror of whose look The savage tribes with tremor shook. A Tuscan Boar upon his right, Whose rage once put a host to flight, Supports his prince; at whose left hand A royal Tiger takes his stand: For here 'twas also understood Judges should be of noble blood. With bamboos arm'd, a Monkey band, Assembled thick on every hand, To summon witnesses, or keep The peace between the dogs and sheep; And twelve grave Bulls empannelled were The jury in this grand affair: The Elephant, with lofty port, High-sheriff of the noble court, Conducted prisoner to the place, To answer plaintiff in the case. The judge, with magisterial growly For order call'd, then bade the Owl The cryer and clerk) to open court And the impending cause report. Cryer. “Whoo-hoo! whoo-hoo! whoo-hoo! This it seems was the Zoologian mode of opening court and it appears to sound as well, and contain full as much meaning, as our modern “O yes! O yes! O yes!” I call Birds, Beasts, and Reptiles, one and all, Who've any suit to try or plead, To name it ere the court proceed; To state each wrong, and cause of sorrow, Or they may not be heard to-morrow.” Ursus, the public prosecutor, A subtle, deep, but calm disputer, Arose with dignity and grace, And thus explain'd the present case: INDICTMENT. “The jurors of the beasts present On oath, that Dog had bad intent, And more than once presumed to leap On plaintiff, while among the sheep. July the first, two years ago, Defendant first began to grow Impertinent, and in the wood Committed actions base and rude; And in and on her body fair, By force of paws, did then and there Beat, bruise, ill treat, assault, and so forth, As plaintiff's evidence will show forth; And other wrongs and injuries, Which modest goats must sure despise, To plaintiff's damage and distress, For which she humbly prays redress.” Count second states a like offence, On March the first—fifteen months since; To both of which defendant pleads “Not guilty,” and the clerk proceeds, The plaintiff's counsel to report, And read their names before the court. The Bear was foremost on the scroll, From frozen regions near the pole, But with acquirements great at least As those of any northern beast; And without tarnish on his name, Ursus was not unknown to fame. A Panther, next, espous'd her cause, No novice in the school of laws; But who deriv'd his greatest fame, From ardour in pursuit of game; For Pardus, fleetest of his race, Was never known to yield the chase. With him appeared a noble Steed, Surpassing all Arabia's breed, Who once had made a despot feel An argument by dint of heel; Who spurn'd oppression's bit and rein, And emigrated o'er the main; And here, the advocate of right, Equus would never yield in fight. A Martin followed on the list The cause of virtue to assist: While, nodding graceful in the rear, The antlers of a Stag appear, Who, were he poised in even balance, Would find his worth surpass his talents; While some of Cervus boldly say, His vanity would both outweigh. These for the Goat. Who view'd the host Thought the poor Mastiff's case was lost; And scarcely could refrain the tear, Till his four champions' names they hear: A Leopard, whose unspotted fame Shed brilliant lustre on the name; Who never yet had moved a paw To strain, pervert, or twist the law; Stood first upon the catalogue Of learned counsel for the Dog. The next, a Buck, of manners mild, Though with a disposition wild, Who more than once, in mortal strife, Had stood at bay and saved his life; And Dama's spunk was thought as good As any Hare's in all the wood. A matchless Greyhound next is named, For honor, wit, and learning, famed, Who, when by tyranny opprest, Burst from his chains and sought the west; And here, when virtue wish'd a friend, Was always foremost to defend; His temples bore the wreath of fame, And faithful Vertagus his name. Sly Reynard next, “though last not least,” As deep in law as any beast, Complete the defendant's number, As more would but the cause encumber. Preliminaries being now Adjusted, well as beasts knew how, A motley host of evidence For prosecution and defence, Of beasts, and birds, and every thing That moves a leg or spreads a wing, (A picture true of Noah's ark) Were ordered forward by the clerk. These ushered in, spectators found A station in the circle round, Where all the curious ones convene To hear and see, or to be seen. What pains, ye gods! both sexes took, At Goat or Dog to hare one look! What winning airs the males assumed! They strutted, prated, swore and fumed; Tried every art, and rack'd invention, To catch the modest Goat's attention. And then the females—how they simpered, Ogled, whispered, smirk'd and whimpered! How the little birds would rummage To adjust their glossy plumage! Then in wanton circles fly, And each attractive movement try To catch the mastiff's roving eye. “The Goat, cries one, must be a brute, So sweet a Dog to prosecute. Accuse the pretty cur of rudeness! Why, the dear rogue's a lump of goodness; I'd not believe the Dog would do it, Although I saw, and felt, and knew it.” “Order!” the judge indignant roar'd.... Order was at the word restored, When Ursus rose, stretch'd forth his paws, And thus for plaintiff ope'd the cause: “Respected members of the jury, I rise reluctant, I assure you, To unfold a blackened catalogue Of actions that must damn the Dog. Your bos-ships are to hear a suit, There is a doubt on my mind respecting this word. Whether it be synonomous with muster, or lord-ships, or whether it be derived from the latin word for bull, the learned must determine. Brought by a harmless female brute, For 'sault and battery by defendant, Who guilty is you may depend on't. The indictment charges him, we find, With acts of that peculiar kind Which law thus technically terms, And, as you hear, the bill affirms The acts were two, distinct in feature, But just the same in grade and nature. Perhaps no crimes more common are, But still, the fame of this affair Has spread so wide, that every beast Must feel a little queer, at least. No doubt, my lord, that some in court, Are prejudiced by mere report; Those, in particular, who know Of circumstances, long ago. In which this Dog was implicated, And justly, too, I've heard it stated. But still, my lord, we would assure you, And all the Bulls upon the jury, That we most earnestly desire Your prejudices may expire; Your prepossessions be discarded, And nought but fact and truth regarded. I only make these observations, Because so many false relations Are handed round, about the fact, As puzzles reason how to act. I therefore, as becomes my station, Request a fair investigation, Impartial, candid, and complete, And then I'm sure of Dog's defeat. “It will turn out in evidence, That Canis, prior to this offence, Was guardian of a certain flock. And, what may well your lordship shock, The plaintiff was a member there, And fed beneath his watchful care. That, under friendship's false pretence, He treacherously allured her thence, And when they were retired apart, Declared the purpose of his heart, Which was....I blush the fact to mention.... Which was....a criminal connection In legal parlance known, my lord, By crim....no, stuprum, that's the word. This not succeeding, he'd recourse, As evidence will show, to force; The extent of which will soon appear, By testimony ready here; And force, of any kind or sort, If proven, will the charge support. Now if the facts I've heard related Turn out to be correctly stated, This Mastiff must, without a doubt, Deserve a cudgel, whip, or knout; But, sapient Bulls, it is for you To say how many blows are due; Or whether crimes like fornication Ought not to hurl him from his station. 'Tis true, the flock beneath his care, Will try to lighten this affair; For they, though oft insulted too, Forgive and love, as spaniels do. And lies are also set afloat About this chaste and virtuous goat: The time elapsed, since first offended, Before complaint, will be extended, And urged against the plaintiff's plea, As proof to set the prisoner free. These circumstances all demand An explanation at our hand, Which shall be given, when we'll show The Goat did....what one ought to do; She'd no desire to bring to shame Her watchful shepherd, though to blame; Till his repeated insults wrung The story from her modest tongue. “In crimes of this peculiar nature, Unseen by every living creature, Except the plaintiff, we can bring No other witness of the thing. But if a single brute shall dare Her testimony to impair, We then shall call on hundreds by To prove she never told a lie. But should the Dog prove innocent Of actions showing bad intent.... Though that event, I think, is hindered, For we've some anchors thrown to windward....aside. This is evidently an anachronism, as it is not to be supposed that these beasts I new any thing about navigation. But my learned friend Tristram Kickshins differs with me in opinion, and asserts that it is sufficiently demonstrated that they did know something about that art, in the 398th line, where it makes mention of the beasts marching on board the ship of capt. Noah. But I take this, and every thing of a similar nature in the poem, to be an expression of the author, and not of the beast to whom it is attributed. It is a figure—a poetica licentia, for which any candid reader will excuse him. My pleasure at his fair acquittal, Will, I assure you, not be little. You all will hear the evidence Against and for the Dog's defence, And will, I hope, a verdict bring Approved by justice, beasts and king.” The counsel for the prosecution Now took their stands without confusion; While Dama, as they thither went, Gave this morceau of humor vent: “Thus when our ancestors of yore Were saved from death by captain Noah, The unclean beasts, without a whip, March'd two and two on board the ship.” Some repartee on this took place, 'Til Capra, witness in the case, Received the oath, with such a look, That hundreds wished themselves the book; While Pardus quick assumed his station, And thus began examination: Pard. Of what offence do you complain Against defendant? Please explain. Capra. Two years ago, to have some chatter, A parrot met.... Dama. That's hear-say matter, And to the question as irrelevant As Dormouse to a fallen Elephant. Equus. As an inducement, (please not stop her) Her evidence is good and proper. Reynard. My lord, I certainly object To this assertion....'ta'nt correct; They've only got to prove the fact, Not what took place before the act. For if they meddle with the cat, We're dish'd at once.... (aside to Canis) Canis. (aside to Reynard) You may say that. Equus. I think that I've a right, my lords, To prove, not only acts but words; For plain it must be to all eyes, That actions oft from words arise; And so it was in this affair, As witness wishes to declare. She was, my lord, about to state Some rumors of an earlier date; Which rumors caused the conversation That gave defendant the occasion; From which occasion, we'll suppose, The vile dishonest wish arose; Which wish, it cannot be denied, Begat the crime for which he's tried. So that if only traced correct, We find the cause of this effect Was rumor. What the rumors were I wish the witness to declare; But if you stop her, I maintain We lose a link from off the chain. The conversation and the act Were one transaction, that's a fact; And Reynard knows the law too well To be in earnest. Let her tell. Reynard. For legal forms our veneration Forbids the smallest innovation. No rule, 'tis always understood, Unless it work both ways, is good; Yet hear-say stuff, against their side, There's not a doubt would be denied; And as it is for law's abuse meant, It can't be good as an inducement. Vertagus. My lord, the public prosecutor (Whose speech for Capra ought to suit her) Express'd a wish that all the court Remain unbiass'd by report; And yet, it seems, they now commence By calling hear-say evidence, The jurors' minds to occupy With things they came not here to try; Things, too, however false or base, That we are not prepared to trace. I hope no rumor finds admission.... And humbly beg the court's decision. Court. Unless essential to the case, We can't give hear-say matter place. Pardus. Well, Capra, then relate the fact, And things coevous with the act. Capra. In March, I think, two years ago, Before the grass began to grow; While yet the fodder of the brutes Was withered herbage, hay, and roots; I ask'd our shepherd, there, the Dog, To come and taste our humble prog, Beneath the shelter of a rock, And hold some chat about the flock. He came as usual, and admired My calm retreat from storms retired; And when refresh'd on chaff reclined, At his request I spoke my mind. I told him all the sheep were bleating, And every goat the tale repeating, That Felis there, a Cat of beauty, Had drawn and lured him from his duty. That when her mate (of mountain race) Was absent, he supplied his place. He told me, that with some surprise, He'd heard these base malicious lies; But wondered why they made selection Of one for whom he'd no affection. “But were it you, he fondly cried, I know not one on earth beside, Of all the beasts or birds that move, With whom I'm half so much in love. I'd rather revel on your charms Than fill an ourang-outang's arms.” In answer, I abruptly told him I had a dozen minds to scold him; For such a speech would sorely shock, The rudest bleater in the flock: And as a guardian of the sheep, A chaster tongue he ought to keep. He own'd his fault without evasion, But hoped I'd save his reputation; And, on condition of my silence, Promised to do his passion vi'lence. A few weeks after, three at least, I waited on this trusty beast Who said some chat he wished to hold On matters that concern'd the fold. So, finding such was his desire, I ventured with him to retire; For fair Canicula, his mate Must have no share in the debate. But scarcely had we gone a yard Before he bit my ear so hard, And frisk'd about, and lick'd my teats.... I'd like to've fallen into fits. I told him if he wa'n't retreating, His slut should quickly hear my bleating; Then got away, and off I run, For butt me! if I like such fun! Pardus. Did he attempt to stop you? Capra. No, He soon was glad to let me go; And when my tongue renewed its strength, I gave the dirty cur its length; Told him, as fast as I could rattle, He was the worst of all God's cattle; And then with just indignant ran!— Reynard. Go slower, if you please. Capra. I can't; For just so fast I gave it him.... Says I, “you good-for-nothing limb, Such treatment is too bad to bear, And henceforth I renounce your care; I will not eat your dirty grass, But leave the fold....so let me pass.” He begg'd I would not be so bad, As that would fairly drive him mad. So seeing him so low in chop, I thought it best to let it drop; And hoping he might yet amend, I parted with him like a friend. 'Twas six weeks after this, or more, Just as I left the granery door, Where he'd been dealing out our food, Canis his wicked suit renew'd, And said, as I received my due, “If you loved me as I love you, You'd grant the little thing I want,”.... I bade him speak no more upon't; Or else, as sure as I was born, I'd tell the whole to Capricorn. “Then, he exclaim'd, by Mammoth Spring, I'll swear you teazed me for the thing; And as the flock respect my station, Who, think you, loses reputation?” He then his old caresses tried, And lick'd me with his tongue beside. Here witness, stifled by her grief, Paused in her story for relief; While Vertagus, despising pelf, Thus thought and spoke within himself: “I fear, by all our monarch's paws, I this time prop a wicked cause; For that to me still right appears, That's sanctified by female tears.” Recovered by the pause she needed, Poor Capra, snuffling, thus proceeded. “His last attempt was while the court Were listening to a Sow's report For the same insults offered her, By this same wicked treacherous cur. His mouth, while talking o'er the matter, Began to froth, his teeth to chatter; And then between his paws he seiz'd me, And without mercy prest and squeez'd me; But I began so loud to squall He did not touch my teats at all.”Pardus. Do you remember his excuses, About the sin of such abuses? Vertagus. My lord, that question seems to me A little straggling. Court. If it be To this transaction any clue, 'Twill be admissible, and do. Capra. Sometime, perhaps four months, ago, A case was pending here, you know, In which a certain wanton Deer, For such a crime was summon'd here; And, if my memory's not in fault, 'Twas just before the last assault. Defendant's words were then, 'tis clear, In favor of the “stricken deer;” And intimated, in discourse, That she was not a whit the worse; Which was, I thought, a hint too pat, To misconceive what he'd be at. He then proceeded, and repeated A list of tricks himself committed; Of tracks, that would, I think, or ought to Cause all the jury's....eyes to water; And by his tell....bad luck resist him! (aside) A half a hundred sluts had kiss'd him; And, after all the catalogue, He thought himself a clever dog. Equus. His language seem'd then to import That he was ne'er the worser for't? Capra. He said, though he'd been rather rude, He knew our sovereign was too good, To punish such a small offence, As just to gratify the sense. And then the antient fable quoted, How once a mouse, for thieving noted, Was caught by Lion in the fact, Who graciously forgave the act. Cross-examined, by Reynard. Reyn. You threatened, prior to this confession, To expose, it seems, the Dog's transgression? This was posterior, was it? Capra. Yes, 'Twas since my threat he told me this, And made me promise not to tell it. Reynard. When he was rude, did you repel it? Or did you make advances? Capra. Never; But as I thought him kind and clever, I told him all my little ailings, My feelings, wishes, thoughts, and failings; Though had I sooner found his lies out, I would have claw'd his beastly eyes out. Reynard. Did you not, Capra....come reflect.... Did you not kiss him? recollect. Capra. Now Mr. Fox! upon my word, I never such a question heard: Such impudence was never seen.... I really do'n't know what you mean; Unless permitting him to kiss, Is what you're after....is it? Reynard. Yes. You did allow a kiss, then, ha? Cap. Why, dogs, you know, will have their way. Reynard. Did you attempt to coax him, ever. Capra. No! by my whiskers, never, never! Equus. Be patient, Capra...these sly oxes, Are fond of touching up the doxies; Though rude the questions which he pushes, Go on, and never mind your blushes. Reynard. Nor say....(I ask it not to tease you) That Capricorn could never please you; And that you thought himself more clever, More fit for certain matters— Capra. Never! Reynard. You never told defendant so, Or any other person? Capra. No. Reyn. Did you not say, the males, you fear'd, Would see how amorously you leer'd, And read your wishes in your eyes? Capra. Never! they're all malicious lies! Reynard. Nor say you dared not be alone With them, for fear— Capra. Why this I own, I said if I were seen to walk With roguish brutes, 'twould make a talk. Reynard. You never mentioned a weak spot Somewhere about you? Capra. Certainly not. Reynard. Nor show'd your dugs to any one Except your partner? This you've done? Capra. Except to him, I never did, Unless when suckling little kid. Reyn. And did you not....the question plain is.... Offer to go to bed to Canis, Or any one but Capricorn? Capra. I never did since I was born. Reynard. You ask'd the Dog if he believed, That Canaan's antient flocks conceived, And mark'd their young by speckled rods? Capra. Never! by all the river gods! Reynard. You know your leader there, the Ass, I mean who leads the female class; Did not you say, whene'er you chose That you could lead him by the nose; And call him Sister Nanny too? Capra. Why, all the females call him so; Because he is the only male We dare admit within the pale. Reynard. With him why is your danger less? Capra. Because he is....humph! you may guess. We used to meet within the fold, A kind of singing club to hold; But though no instrument he play'd, Yet when we bleated, then he bray'd. Reynard. How many she's with sister Nan, United in this tuneful plan? Capra. Not more than eight or nine, or ten. Court. What was this brayer's conduct then? Was't modest, chaste, correct, no word Or act indecent? Capra. No, my lord. Reyn. You're sure you could have told to none You fear'd with males to be alone, Lest you should rude advances make? Capra. O! name it not for goodness' sake! For if my weakness were so great, Yet pride would never let me say't. Here prosecutor's counsel chose To rest their cause, when Dama rose; And with a most engaging port, In terms like these address'd the court: “My lord, 'tis easy to conceive That we may piously believe Our client guiltless of transgression, Yet not be free from apprehension. Our greatest danger lies with those Whose sex forbids to call them foes, But whose attractions charm the soul And all our reasoning powers control. 'Tis known that their inventive powers Surpass, in every instance, ours; And here, necessity will drive To keep finesse and art alive. Ardent in every passion still, They know no arbiter but WILL; And are the same, in love or hate, The pivots of revolving fate. We've also much to fear, from those Ingenious counsel who're to close; Who've the advantage over ours In numbers, eloquence, and powers. Indeed, my lord, it seems to me, A kind of novelty, to see So many champions of the laws Enlisted in a plaintiff's cause. In every criminal debate There's counsel furnish'd by the state, Whose duty, to convict defendant, Is not relax'd, you may depend on't. Then why this ardor, to enlist A host of veterans to assist? What, but a thirst of vengeance, could Induce a search through all the wood, For beasts of talents, cull'd and pickt, An honest mastiff to convict? The jury should consider this, In order not to act amiss; For if their testimony fails, Without such props, when truth assails, It will....it must be understood Their testimony can't be good. It will, your honors, be our duty To impeach the credit of this beauty; To open to your comprehension, The nature of the fears I mention. It is, your honors of the jury, The merciless, unrelenting fury, Which does and always will arise, When we a female's love despise. Of all the furies we could mention, Of earth, or hell, or fiend's invention; Dragons, vipers, scorpions, adders, Rattle-snakes with poison bladders; Crocodiles and alligators, With the worst of fiend-like natures; Can never be compared, for harms, To females with neglected charms. It will, of course, become your duty, With this exasperated beauty, To watch, with scrutinizing eye, Her arts and machinations sly. Vengeance is rankling in her heart, And summons all her motionless art; Her poison'd tongue can sting the soul, And nothing can its power controul; Deep is perdition's baseless pit, But her revenge is deeper yet. “We shall be able, sirs, I trust, To prove this Goat's lascivious lust; Her open and obscene advances, Improving all her secret chances To inflame the mastiff with desire, And set his wishes all on fire. It ought to claim our admiration That he resisted such temptation, Where acts obscene were join'd with beauty, To draw defendant from his duty. The rude idea must surely shock Each modest member of the flock; The thoughts of actions so obscene, Moistens my eyes....my mouth I mean. [aside I say, my lord, the bare reflection Raises a blush in my complexion; Though, by-the-by, were I my client, She'd not have wish'd in vain, rely on't. [aside Acts more lascivious too, it plain is, Than those which she imputes to Canis, “Tis not, my lord, in such a case, My learned adversary's place To say if Canis, thus assail'd By artful lust, in duty fail'd; Or if be fell, to what extent, Through error's giddy maze he went: The case was to his flock submitted, By whom he fairly was acquitted. 'Tis for the jury to enquire, (Not his intention or desire, But, leaving every other fault) Whether he's guilty of assault And battery upon the goat; And if so, whether she, or not, Consented to't....if that's the case, The Dog's acquittal must take place. The point for your investigation Is, whether Capra gave occasion, Or to defendant made advances. But still my noble lord, the chance is, That our opponent's learned chatter May load the case with foreign matter, And other things connect and join, Entangled like a twisted vine. But, honored jurors, I've no doubt you All will have your wits about you. And hold the power within your brain, To ravel out the knotty skein. You've but to stick to these two things From which the whole contention springs; Two points for your enquiry fitted.... Firstly, was the fact committed? Secondly, this being so, Was it against her will, or no? But we are ready to support, Such stubborn facts before the court, As will convince a beast of feeling, The plaintiff never was unwilling. We'll prove that, by her own confession, She always itch'd for such transgression; And that, if prest by any beast, The goat was passive, say the least. And if your honors we acquaint, That since the date of her complaint, As well as months and years before, She prais'd defendant more and more; Has wheedled, coax'd, and sought to hold him, Has followed, flattered, and cajoled him; Trying to draw the one from goodness Whom she accuses now with rudeness; In vain will she pretend to claim A matron's chaste and honest name. “I'll not detain your honors longer, Than just to state the question stronger: Whether the Dog committed ill, And whether 'twas against her will.” Canis whispers Dama. Canis. Well done, my Buck, we'll catch the gulls, The gloss you gave will quiz the Bulls. Who's our first witness? Dama. (whispering) modest Ovis. Canis. A buxom ewe. Dama. Ah! she's no novice; She know her cue....besides, 'tis thought She's little jealous of the goat; And we have many hopes from thence. Call up and swear our evidence.... [aloud. Cryer. First—Ovis! Ovis. Here! Cryer. My gentle ewe, We'll have a chat along with you; Hold up your paw. Dama. No! call the rest, And swear them all at once; that's best. Cryer. Parrot, Magpie, Woodcock, Widgeon, Jackdaw, Redbreast, Turkey, Pigeon, Ringdove, Blackbird, Goldfinch, Grouse, Rabbit, Hedgehog, Weasel, Mouse, Ferrit, Rat, Opposum, Moose, Mockbird, Patridge, Snipe and Goose. THE OATH. “You all and sev'rally declare, Affirm, insist, aver, and swear, That all the stories you report, As evidence before the court, Shall be the truth, and nothing more, A thing they never spoke before.... [aside So may the monarch of the wood, Supply you all with drink and food.” Dama. Come, now, my lively, bounding ewe, Ovis, we'll first examine you. You're a member of the bleating canton? You know the plaintiff, ha? Ovis. Balantum! I mess'd with her, sometime ago, And consequently I must know. Dama. You've seen her often with defendant? Ovis. Aye! that I have, you may depend on't. Dama. Have you not seen her call him to her? Ovis. I have. Dama. What time? Ovis. I am not sure; But think 'twas near two years ago, 'Twas pleasant weather, that I know. Dama. At her request, did he not call, Repeatedly, at Capra's stall? Ovis. She often ask'd him when he couldn't: Sometimes he came....sometimes he wouldn't. Dama. Would she her choicest food prepare, And treat the Dog, to coax him there? Ovis. O yes....so well she fed the cur, She almost starved myself and her. Dama. This intimacy was, you say, Sometime in summer? Ovis. After May. Dama. And yet, my lord, two months before She'd been insulted o'er and o'er! Ovis. One evening, he was with us there, When, on my honor, I declare, She kiss'd him....for the smack I heard, And saw his tongue about her beard. Dama. Where was her mate, then, Capricorn. Ovis. Why, on that evening he was gone, To see a public show, I think, Some capers of a northern Mink. Dama. Did Capra e'er the Dog invite, To tarry with her all the night? Come, recollect yourself. Ovis. I will.... He slept there once, when he was ill. Dama. A hydrophobia, I suppose. Ovis. And the next morning, when I rose, I met her coming from his straw, And this my lord, I swear I saw. Dam. [to Canis] Poor Ovis then was disappointed? Canis. [to D.] Yes, all our plans were quite disjointed. Dama. Was Capricorn then present? Ovis. No, But where he was, I do not know; It always seem'd to be her care, To send and get defendant there, During the absence of her mate. Dama. Can you now recollect the date, When last she yean'd, and whom you saw That came to see her in the straw? Ovis. Yes, that event took place, I know, Last April, sir, a year ago; And then she sent for Canis thither, Who had a secret confab with her. Reynard. O! she intended nothing worse Than just to learn the Dog to nurse. Dama. Did Capra ever make remarks, About her eyes' alluring sparks? Ovis. She said she fear'd to have them shown, Lest all her wishes should be known. With males herself she dared not trust, She was so great a slave to lust; And had too weak a spot about her. Dama. She wish'd her mate was warmer, stouter? Ha? Did she not? How was it, Ovis? Ovis. She call'd her Capricorn a novice: He did the best he could to please her, But still, poor thing, he did but tease her; She wish'd a mate, whose amorous fires, Were equal to her own desires; Some love-physician who could cure her Of what they call Uterus furor. Reyn. For that the best would have to strain hard. Martin. Why not apply to Dr. Reynard? Dama. Did any conversation pass, With you and Capra, 'bout the Ass? Ovis. She said she could, whene'er she chose, Lead sister Nanny by the nose. Cross-examined, by Pardus. Pardus. From Capra's conduct, you conceived, She had no virtue? Ovis. I believed That she was light and vain; but had No proof of acts extremely bad. Pardus. Her conversation you conceived Libidinous? Ovis. So I believed, For if it turns out otherwise, I can't believe my ears and eyes. Pardus. Did Capricorn the Dog invite, The time he came and staid all night? Ovis. He did. Pardus. The time you heard the kiss, Canis complained of illness? Ovis. Yes. But as for that, she's not to blame, I would myself have done the same. Dama. I dare be sworn you would my ewe.... aside. Pardus. He never gave a kiss to you? Ovis. O yes....before he quitted us, He offered me a kind of buss. Pardus. Her mate was present, was he not, When Capra mentioned her weak spot? Ovis. He was. Pardus. And when she mentioned too, That all she wish'd he could not do? Ovis. He might have heard it; but if not, I'm sure she spoke the thing she thought. Pardus. The Dog kiss'd you as well as her? Ovis. Twice only....hang the stupid cur!... [aside Pardus. Both friendly kisses, I suppose? Yes....more than friendly had he chose.... [aside. Pardus. From Capra's treatment of the cur, You thought not he'd insulted her? Ovis. O no....I thought, and justly too, That her attachment stronger grew. Phœbus the azure vault had clomb, And now was gliding down the dome; Great Appalachian's awful brow, Had cast a lengthened shade below; And, to descend to meaner things, The sunflower faced the western springs; When Leo, by his appetite, Thought all the beasts might want a bite, And so, that he might grow no thinner, Adjourned the court, and went to dinner.

Author's MS. The human mind's a tilting field, Where two strong active spirits wield The missive dart or pointed lance, And parry, thrust, retreat, advance, Or close, in obstinate affray, Till one or t'other gains the day. But still the fight is not decided, Their powers and rights are so divided, The desperate war is still renew'd, For neither can be quite subdued; But each is, in his turn, the master, Like Pollux and his brother Castor. These spirits, (as we might suppose, They being such eternal foes) Are as unlike in form and feature, As much opposed in looks and nature, And as dissimilar in all, As God and Satan, since the fall. When charity expands the breast, The first of virtues and the best; When Love within the soul arises, Which all the law of God comprises; In short, when we're inclined to good, And have some selfish wish subdued; We may be sure the fiend has reel'd, And that the angel holds the field. But when we yield to passion's sway, And hate or envy's rule obey; It will as certainly be found, The angel welters on the ground; That we have turn'd the fate of war, And placed Apollyon on the car. For though we fight on neither side, 'Tis ours the victory to guide, And by a vote we turn the scale, For vice or virtue to prevail. Too indolent, unless befriended, To keep our heavy arm extended, In careless ease we let it drop, And virtue falls with vice atop. In such a case, 'tis my opinion, Rather than vice should hold dominion, We'd best confess our arm is weak, And succour in Religion seek; There we can find a potent charm, Sufficient to support an arm Of nature's smallest, weakest son, Although that arm should weigh a ton. But stay, I'll demonstrate my meaning: When Victory once by turns was leaning On different sides of hostile foes, Now aiding these, now helping those; Doubtful which way to turn the scale, That this or that should most prevail, The leader of the chosen band, In Israel's favor rais'd his hand, And quick as thought their foes retreat, Nor dared the tide of fate to meet; His hand withdrawn, the vanquish'd turn, And with rekindled ardor burn, While Israel's ranks dismay'd and broke, By thousands fell beneath the stroke. In this dilemma, undismay'd, He calls for holy Aaron's aid, (A beauteous figure of that power, Who still supports us every hour) The wearied arm the Priest sustain'd, And Israel soon the field regain'd, On their pursuers turn'd the flood, And dyed the plain with heathen blood; Thus gain'd the day and battle too, And pay'd their vows wherever due. A female, not to vice inclined, Whose taste and manners are refined; With sensibility enough To feel, and weep, and such like stuff; Who would not, for her credit's sake, In public countenance a rake; Who goes to church, like me and you, Because mankind in general do; I say, a female, of this sort, (And half the sex are such, I'm taught) Alive to elocution's charms, And all the delicate alarms, Which the sweet honey of persuasion, Might in her fluttering breast occasion; May, in the course of life's affairs, While at the church repeating prayers, Prefer (for all possess a taste) Some clergyman to all the rest. So great his powers in declamation, It wraps her soul in admiration; So warm his fervor and his zeal, She must unknown devotion feel; She seems in some celestial region.... She thinks, in short, she loves religion. How dull appears the lingering week, She longs so much to hear him speak; To view those eyes of meek devotion, And feel again that sweet emotion. The Sabbath comes....to church she goes, Again the stream of rapture flows; And, as he meets his various duties, She sees new, undiscovered beauties. She feels that life's insipid round Affords no sweets like those she's found, And wonders why she wandered wrong, In search of happiness so long. I'll not assume the high commission To judge of such a soul's condition, But would, with modesty, enquire, Is it religion, or desire? Which champion, in the mental field, Has made his adversary yield? Which beats? (I ask with motive civil) Which beats, the angel or the devil? Is our digression long enough.... Or are you fond of moral stuff? If so, I will relate a tale, Which shows how oft our efforts fail To hide our shame; because the means Which we would hide behind, as screens, Will often play a trick so scurvy, That we are blown up topsy-turvy. Have patience, friend, we'll be in court Full time enough to see the sport; Then give the beasts a chance to dine, Who've appetites like yours and mine. Clarinda was a country lass, Possessing charms enough to pass; With rosy cheeks and buxom mein— The greatest romp upon the green. Her father, justice in the place, Was a great lover of the chase, And in pursuit of fowl and deer, He spent the third of every year. Yet to official duty's claim He'd yield the swift pursuit of game; And take his see with such a grace, As show'd he knew his proper place. Clarinda had imbibed a passion.... Not for a clown, or man of fashion, But...(laugh ye belles, of dressing prouder) A passion for the....smell of powder. O wonderful spirit of prophecy, that could thus foretel the invention of gunpowder! Had this story been written for Zoologian libraries, at that day, it could not have been comprehended. Never experienced she such pleasure As, when alone and quite at leisure, To steal her father's hunting flask, And then commence her martial task; Lay a long train upon the floor, Then touch it off....and then lay more; And this was still her occupation, In spite of dad's expostulation; Till finding nothing could reclaim her, He swore coercive means should tame her. One day, Clarinda, left at home, Had nought to do but romp and roam, When, with a resolution rash, She vow'd she'd have one little flash; So, after closing every door, Upon the middle of the floor, She built a pyramid of powder, Moistened and prest, to speak the louder. From this she led a circling train, All round the room, and round again; And then a piece of twisted paper, To serve as slow-match, crown'd her caper. From farthest corner of the room, Clarinda view'd her match consume, Waiting to see the flame attain The other end, and light the train; But, ere her hopes were realized, Approaching steps the maid surprised; Who, thinking that her dad was near, And quite beside herself with fear, Thought nothing of the train or match, But, like a fowl that sits to hatch, To put suspicion fast asleep, She, squatting down, conceal'd the heap; Her father enters....she turns pale.... The train is caught, and—there's my tale. A short repast the beasts partook, And quaff'd the cool refreshing brook; Then sported round the flowery plain, Till Leo took his seat again. The Bulls, apart from all the rest, Reposed on nature's velvet vest, And ruminating there at ease, On both the learned counsel's pleas, The fragrant cud at leisure chew'd, At once digesting law and food. But soon aroused by Jackall's roar, They all assembled as before; When Dama took his former station, And thus pursued examination; A Magpie, on defendant's side, To his enquiries thus replied: Dama. Come, little Mag, we wish to know What you can tell. Mag. Two years ago, With Capra I commenced my stay, Nor left her till this year, in May. I built my nest within her stall, She gave me seed, and drink, and all; And, in return, I had to fly On all her errands, low and high; And, when her little kids would weep, To sing the noisy rogues to sleep. Dama. And were you sent, among the rest, To invite the Mastiff as a guest? Mag. O! frequently. Whene'er her mate Was going out to tarry late, She bade me urge the dog to come, As Capricorn was not at home; And, if he spoke with hesitation, Repeat and press the invitation? Dama. And when he came, what pass'd between them. Mag. Her care was such I've never seen them; For all the birds were sent away, As long as Canis pleased to stay. One evening, after sending thrice, (Her kid went once, and I'd been twice) She bade me tell him to be quick. And come, or Capra would be sick! Dama. Alas! poor Gout! Mag. I've seen her, too, Expose her dugs to public view; And ask a Stag, with wanton air, If e'er he saw so fine a pair. Cross-examined, by Pardus. Pardus. Did she then know that you were by? Mag. I cannot tell. Pardus. Inform us why You left her service, little bird? Mag. Because she did not keep her word. Pardus. Was Capra suckling, when she show'd The Stag her dugs?—explain the mode. Mag. Yes, I believe that was the case. Pardus. How look'd the beast? Mag. He hid his face. Reynard. A thing not common to the breed. Cervus. A modest fox were rare indeed. Dama. Who's next? Leopardus. The Parrot. Dama. Pretty Poll, Let's hear your story....tell it all. Poll. An Antelope accused the cur Of some attempts to ravish her; And made complaints to all the fold, Of acts which ought to be controll'd. They met to hear her accusation, But found, on her examination, That he had nothing rude committed, So proved she lied, and him acquitted. A short time after, (this I know Was just about two years ago) I ask'd the Goat, in friendly chat.... “Would Canis do a thing like that?” “No, she replied, 'tis all a lie, For who's so free with him as I? And, were he so disposed, you see, I think he might have ravish'd me. Why, once I gave him every chance, And made myself a warm advance, So, were he wantonly inclin'd, He must have then been dull or blind.” I heard her rally Felis, once, And call her partner-cat a dunce; While she the charge reiterates, Till both at length condemn their mates. One day she told me she believed, From circumstances, she'd conceived But added, “if a kid be born, It can't belong to Capricorn.” Ursus. Where was it Capra made advances, And gave the Dog these secret chances? Poll. 'Twas on Missouri's verdant brink, Where both had been to bathe and drink. Ursus. When Capra held the modest chat, About their partners, with the Cat, Did it degrade them in your eyes? Poll. It could not well be otherwise. Equus. And had not Capra, then, my bird, With several kids increased the herd? Poll. She had. [Parrot dismissed.] Dama. Who's next? Leopardus. Columba! here, We next must call on you my dear; Please take the stand Dama. My gentle bird, Inform us what you've seen and heard. Columba. We Pigeons, sir, in flocks reside Hard by the river, 'tother side; But I have often hither flown, And left my mate at home alone. In summer time, two years ago, Capra and I contrived it so, That I should fly across the river, And spend an hour in private with her. While we conversed on different things, The newest cut for pigeon-wings, It is not to be supposed that the polite accomplishment of dancing had ever been introduced among the savage race; how then, exclaims the critic, became they acquainted with one of the most beautiful steps belonging to that art? Why, Mr. What-I've-call'em, Fashion, that fickle goddess, eldest daughter of Iris, by that unparalleled rake Old Mr. Caprice, has existed in all ages, countries, nations, kingdoms and people, biped or quadruped, civilized or uncivilized, ever since Adam and Eve emerged from swaddling-clothes. Is it, then, so very unnatural, sir, that two females should converse upon the subject of dress and ornament, when they were alone together for one whole hour? In this kingdom of brutes, at the time my author wrote, the shape of wings, the color of hair, and the crook of horns, were esteemed considerations of the first importance. Let this explanation serve for every other passage in the whole poem, where there is the shadow of allusion to the same project. My friend Samuel must be mistaken, when he declares that the daughter of Iris was begotten by Mister Caprice. It is not in the nature of things to suppose Caprice is any thing more or less than a woman. I and Doctor Johnson, both of us, agree in this; and also Mr. Shakspeare, who says, “Frailty, thy name is woman! And for a more strong conviction, I say, in my Classical Dissertation on the nature of Things, O! Woman! What art thou, Woman! Tristram Kickshins. Or the most fashionable hair, And beard, and horns, for Goats to wear, She ask'd me if I did not hate To be so long without my mate? “For, added she, I never could, If Capricorn was only good; But I am ne'er the better for him, Unless I teaze, and kick, and spur him.” Pardus. My lord, I humbly do conceive— Equus. My lord— Pardus. I'll speak, sir, by your leave.... My lord— Leopardus. My lord— Equus. My lord— Martin. My lord— Leopardus. We have a right— Pardus. Hear me one word; This seems on billingsgate to border— Reynard. I wish— Equus. Your lordship— Court. Order! Order! Equus. I'll not object, my lord, about This fiend-like malice coming out... Vertagus. That term will suit the accusation, Not the defence. Equus. Their own damnation Is seal'd by such defence, I think. Reynard. It seals our safety from its brink. Cross-examined, by Pardus. Pardus. What was your answer? let us know. Columba. I could not speak, it shock'd me so. Pardus. And flew you then direct away? Columba. I did not many minutes stay. Pardus. How often, since, have you been there? Columba. Not more than once or twice, I'll swear. Can. [aside to Dam.] The Pigeon's evidence will do. Dama. You may say that....she's up a few. Canis. More tales like this this, from others fish'd, Will blast her fame, and Capra's dish'd. Dama. There's plenty to confirm Columba's. Call up the next. Who is't? Leopardus. Palumbes. Dama. Give way, and let the Ringdove pass.... Fly over all their heads, my lass. What can you tell in this affair? Palumbes. I sat upon a willow.... Dama. Where? Palumbes. Close to the rapid river's brim, Where both the parties came to swim. From sporting on the rolling billow, They came to sport beneath my willow; Capra of being chill'd complain'd, Though I believed her shivering feign'd; Then nestling down with fondest care He warm'd her with his—shaggy hair; And in that posture, by the powers, They lay together two long hours. I thought her conduct quite improper, But then I had no right to stop her. [Palumbes dismissed.] Reyn. Capra appears to've been a hold wench. Dama. Is Carduelis here, the Goldfinch? O there you are....come forward, Miss. You've seen the prosecutrix kiss The Mastiff? Tell us where and when. Carduelis. Four years ago....I lived there then. He'd just been shorn, and look'd so sleek, She to her bosom press'd his cheek, And kiss'd him. Dama. That you say you saw? Carduelis. I did: she prest him with her paw. Cross-examined, by Pardus. Pardus. Did Capra know you saw her do it? Carduelis. No, I expect they neither knew it. Leopardus. The Blackbird's next. Dama. Merula, you Know Capra? Merula. Yes, indeed I do: You'll always find within her door A dozen singing birds or more. Two years ago, myself was one, And then I saw a deal of fun; Such pains the Goat would take, to keep The watchful guardian of the sheep. She would the best of food prepare, Then send a bird to coax him there, And if her message was in vain, She'd send it o'er and o'er again. (Merula dismissed.) Dama. And now Penelope, for you.... You know the parties? Penelope. Yes. I do, As well as any Widgeon here. Dama. How did the Goat to you appear? Penelope. You'll judge from what on oath I state. Canicula, the Mastiff's mate, Invited me, a year ago, To chat with her an hour, or so. The Goat came in while I was there, And ask'd the Dog, with such an air! “What think you of my corporation? My shape's improved to admiration; You wish Canicula, I know, Were thriving in dimensions so.” And so went on with such-like stuff, Till he, I guess, was sick enough. [Penelope dismissed.] Canis. You guess, my pretty Widgeon, truly. Reynard. Who's next? Dama. The lovely Monedula. Reynard. I'll question her. My pretty Daw, Of this affair, tell what you saw. Monedula. I've often heard the Dog complain, That Capra's fondness gave him pain: I've seen her practise every art, And play the suppliant's humble part, Enticing him to go with her, Yet meet repulses from the Cur. When too much teaz'd with invitation, He sometimes left his occupation, And spent an evening with her...still It seem'd repugnant to his will. She said, “the beasts will sometimes talk, Because I go with him to walk, But I do'nt care a straw who knows it, While my blind mate will not oppose it.” I sometimes ask'd her if she thought The various charges which were brought Against her favorite, were true? She answered, they were false she knew. I told her I believed them so... And this was not four months ago. Cross-examined by Ursus. Ursus. Is Canis on good terms with you? Monedula. On terms becoming any two. Ursus. And did he ever kiss you? Monedula. No. But even if it had been so, I'd not have brought him into court, To expose myself for public sport. Loop. A decent hint for Capra, that... [aside to Can. Canis. For Capra, Scrofa, and the Cat. Ursus. Did Capra, oftener than the rest, Invite the Dog to be her guest? Or did he visit all he knew? Mondeula. I have seen others urge him too, But not like Capra. Ursus. What was told Concerning Canis in the sold? What was his character? Vertagus. My lord, I bar the question. Not a word Have we adduced before the court, Our client's credit to support; Such threads we've not thought fit to tissue, And therefore 'tis not put in issue. We cannot be prepared to meet The vague reports our foes repeat, All foreign to the present charge. But on this point I'll not enlarge; His lordship knows as well as I Such questions are not legal. Ursus. Why? My lord, my learn'd opponent shows, How little of the law he knows, About reports to raise a clatter, Which lead directly to the matter. They're not illegal, I contend. Court. We can't admit them. Ursus. Then they end. [Monedula dismissed.] Dama. Numidica is next. Reynard. Desire Her Turkeyship to walk up higher. You've lived with Canis. Saw you aught In Capra's visits, that you thought Improper? Numidica. Seven months ago She came....though half-leg deep in snow; And with the Dog retired behind A rock which screen'd them from the wind; They soon returned, when Capra cried, “Adieu, my dear!....I'm satisfied!” Dama. O rare exploit! auspicious day In Capra's life! Numidica. Then went away. Cross-examined by Ursus. Ursus. Did they converse about the flock, Before they went behind the rock? Numidica. All that I heard was, she desired A secret word, and they retired: The subject of their conversation, Perhaps surpass'd my penetration. Reynard. 'Twas not too deep for Capra's, though, If we may judge from what we know. Here, for the present, rest the case, And give our adversaries place. The prosecution next commence, Examining their evidence; Bubo their names proclaim'd aloud. And having drawn them from the crowd, He qualified them with a phiz, As grave as any judge's is. Asinus first assumed the stand, An Ass, with mein and manners bland; With aspect modest and serene, Perhaps the meekest ever seen; Whose movements ne'er surpast a pace, Save when he sought the Dog's disgrace, And then, as if the de'll pursued, He gallop'd swiftly through the wood. Ursus. What conversation did you hold, With Canis, guardian of the fold, Respecting Capra's accusations? Reynard. Here's more reports and conversations. But I sincerely hope, my lord, Before this testimony's heard, The nature of it may be scann'd, And fully open'd. Ursus. Understand, My learn'd opponents, 'tis to show That the defendant, months ago, Made to Asinus full confession, And own'd the whole of his transgression. Asinus. We instituted a committee To talk with Canis out of pity; Advise him to confess his errors, Nor meet disgrace with all its terrors; But the alarming danger shun. Of this committee I was one. Felis desired an interview With Canis. Leopardus. What have we to do With Cats again? Why not relate The theme of any tete-a-tete As well as this? Such evidence Repugnant is to common sense. Ursus. This conversation was, my lord, Communicated, word for word, To Canis, and on that was built The full confession of his guilt; 'Twas the inducement, or the basis Of his confession...such the case is. Dama. My lord, confessions cannot be Direct, (so it appears to me) When such inducements....such extortion, Have drawn them forth....why, 'tis abortion; There must be no inducement, sir, To a confession of the Cur. Equus. My lord, I will maintain there should, That it may well be understood What the confession has betray'd, And in what spirit it was made. Court. You may go on and tell the court What you to Canis did report, If to the point it bear relation. Ursus. Did you report the conversation Between the Goat and Felis? Asinus. Yes. Dama. I must again object to this. We're not prepared in our defence To answer hear-say evidence, Which this but leads to introduce.... I must object to such abuse. Pardus. While they so very active are To impeach our witness, 'tis but fair To let her former declaration Give present ones corroboration. And secondly, my lord, we would, Have the concealment understood, Accounted for, by showing you What first from her the secret drew. And thirdly, touching the transgression, Show what induced the Dog's confession, And in what sense 'twas understood: Is not such testimony good? Vertagus. This is a most refined pretence To introduce, as evidence, The accusations of a herd Who can't substantiate a word, And who, besides, dare not appear To make these accusations here. If the shrill mewings of a Cat Against the Dog, with this and that, Are here admitted, in succession, As an inducement to confession, Crimes might against the Dog appear, Which he's no right or power to clear. Already there has been enough Aspersions, charges, and such stuff, Spread round by Scandal's busy hand, Without support on which to stand. Scrofa, the Sow, who did her share, In charges here before the chair, Was proved, and is considered, now, An infamous lascivious Sow, For slander's filthy gutter fitted, And Canis was of course acquitted. Yet now, our adversaries wish To serve, a second time, this dish. Well, then, my noble lord, suppose That, after all this slander goes Ex Parte to the horned jury, For so it must be I assure you, That no confession should appear? It goes for nothing then, 'tis clear.... But probably your lordship thinks, As I do, that such slander stinks, And that the court ought not to hear it. Not that our client need to fear it, But that, my noble lord, because, 'Tis innovating on the laws. At all events, it must be best, If Canis any thing confest, To let it first be simply stated, And when its nature is debated, If it then call for explanation There's time enough. Reynard. One observation, And only one will I intrude. It must, I think, be understood, That a confession, in the fold, However black, should not be told. Unless necessity may call, It should not be reveal'd at all; 'Twould be a breach of confidence, Excusable on no pretence. For sake of argument, suppose He did confess....whate'er he chose; That they extorted some expression Which they denominate confession; On what condition was it made? This, doubtless....“Not to be betray'd.” Then why uncharitably reveal What they have promised to conceal? This, I affirm, is acting wrongly. Equus. Which I, my lord, deny as strongly; I reconcile such evidence To conscience, law and common sense. Court. Asinus, you'd a conversation, Which to the subject bears relation, With the defendant? Please to state it. Asinus. I will, my lord, with truth relate it: By the request of Felis, sir, I had a meeting with the cur. 'Twas six days (I remember now) Before the trial of the Sow. Ursus. But, on a certain time, did you With Canis ask an interview? Asinus. I did, just after Scrofa's trial, And he expressing no denial, Agreed the interview to hold In Mulus' stall below the fold. A conversation I related, (After the Cat her own had stated With the defendant) which would let Some accusations— Vertagus. With regret, I interrupt the evidence, (If to that name it have pretence) But duty bids me say, my lord, With your indulgence....but one word... [to Ursus. It strikes me that whate'er they call Confessions here, will, after all The means to which they have resorted, Turn out to be from him extorted, By unfair threats....if that's the case, The jury should not give it place. I, therefore, lest debate should tire, Would beg his lordship to enquire, Whether, amid such threatening furies, The Dog was so far sui juris, As that his words, without restriction, Are proofs enough for his conviction. My lord, confessions should be made Where neither hopes nor fears invade, To be sufficient evidence Of any Dog's conviction: hence, That offered by the present witness Is now opposed for its unfitness. For if it should, my lord, appear, That these concessions rose from fear Of such an hostile combination, Which play'd on his imagination; Which sported with his hopes and fears, While in dismay, distress, and tears, Lest malice, should he not confess, Would murder all his happiness: I say, my lord, if this be true, He'd a more dreadful fate in view, Than the worst Alligator's fury, That swims the waters of Missouri. Leopardus. When officers come into court A beast's confession to report, It is their duty first to swear, That 'twas not gain'd by means unfair; That threats nor bribes the secret wrung, But free volition moved the tongue. This is the right of the accused; And though the threats or bribes be used By inducement of the prosecutor, Or by himself ...as best shall suit her, It still destroys the evidence. Equus. Reason, my lord....mere common sense, Is full enough to show each word My friends have said, to be absurd. But let the question now be put And if they get an answer to't In their own favor, by permission, We'll then have time for disquisition. Pardus. Asinus, previous to relating To Canis, what the Cat was stating, And what the Gout had told the Cat, Did you use threats? come, answer that. Asinus. I answer no. But Felis told him, In tone as if she meant to scold him, That if he did not see her mate, Her mate would see the Mastiff, straight. Court. Could what you uttered be construed As promises, or threatenings rude; Asinus. 'Twas hoped, my lord, as all advised, The matter would be compromised. Before confession, nought was stated Concerning what the Cat related. Her own affair, we hoped, would drop, And no one ever rake it up. My charges 'gainst the Dog, were three.... Just as the Goat had told to me: First, his professions of affection, Which met from Capra due rejection; And, secondly, resort to force, Which rudeness was repell'd....(of course) And, thirdly, what took place between The parties at the granary scene. I then began, and to his face, Pronounced him infamous and base; He wept and so did the committee.... “A Dog weep! nonsense! such a thing was never heard of—I'd not believe it, though himself should swear it” Why, my friend, you must be an ignorant puppy, if you really doubt the fact. How do you define the word weep? I tell you, once for all, that there is a Zoologian method of weeping as well as of kissing. Every thing has its mode. Who does not know that a Deer, taken by the hounds, sheds tears like a man? Some brutes possess more sensibility than some men. Translator. My learned friend Samuel is correct: and I am happy to find he agrees with myself and Dr Johnson. If a dog is capable of laughing, why should we suppose he is deprived the opposite sensation? for instance, “High diddle diddle, the Cat's in the fiddle, “The dish run after the spoon; “The Little Dog laugh'd to see such craft, “The Cow jump'd over the moon.” Harvey's Meditation, in the Tombs. Thus we find, from undoubted authority, that a dog can laugh; and to prove that he can cry, I will give an extract from a beautiful Poem which I wrote on Mosquito shooting, where I say “The 'Sketers they made such a hum, “The little dogs all wept—by Gum!” Tristram Kickshins. He through confusion....we from pity. He said he felt such keen distress He would the shameful truth confess; That his behaviour to these two (The Cat and Goat) was bad he knew; So bad, he'd thought the Sow was sent An instrument of punishment. He afterwards, however, said That this confession which he made, Was not intended to include The acte, but conversations rude. Cross-examined by Reynard. Reynard. What office did the Mastiff hold, Before appointed in the fold? Asinus. Near Mississippi's farthest spring, He waited on our Mammoth king. Dama. What character does Capra bear? Asinus. I never heard but that 'twas fair. Court. Did she assert, do you suppose, That she could lead you by the nose? Asinus. I heard she said so, but must doubt it.... At least, I care not much about it. Dama. Told she the truth, that you by many, Were call'd no name but “Sister Nanny?” Asinus. Envy alone gave me that name.... It never ting'd my cheek with shame. Reynard. That which would cause an Ass to blush Would bury other beasts in brush. At this couplet many of my friends have stumbled; but to me it appears as plain as A, B, C. It amounts simply to this: “An action that would make an Ass feel ashamed, would cause other beasts to fly into a thicket, and hide their heads in underwood or brush.” Translator. My friend Samuel is wrong again. The Arabian author meant, brush! that is, be off! Or as a Grecian author says, Push on, keep moving, my hearty! And I have classically expressed a similar sentiment in my Dissertation on Earthen Ware, where I say, That bitch has broke my pickle pot, And she shall brush—by all that's hot! Tristram Kickshins. [aside. Equus. Who was the first, of all the fold, That call'd you so? Asinus. I've not been told. Dama. Believed you Scrova's accusation? Asinus. Not till the present confirmation; But now I do, and so I told The Mastiff, when before the fold. Reyn. You thought that Capra was not blameless? But prone to acts which....shall be nameless. Asinus. If I made use of that expression, 'Twas grounded on the Dog's confession. Reynard. You have felt deeply interested In this affair, since first contested? Cervus. To that inquiry I object. Dama. I'll prove the question is correct; Because, my lord, it will be seen That this meek Ass was moved by spleen; Was urged by hate and envy's sway, Like some inveterate beast of prey; To range the forest, hill and bog, For instruments to crush the Dog. Court. Do you feel enmity or hate Against the Dog? Asinus. I mourn his fate; Consider him a fallen brother, Nor hate him worse than any other. Dama. And for your fallen brother's good Did you not ransack all the wood, In search of counsel for the state, To seal your fallen brother's fate? Asinus. That I can answer, if I must. Dama. Did not my friend, the Courser, first, Apply to you for leave to act Against him? Equus. I deny the fact. The course I took, my lord, was built On full persuasion of his guilt; And when retain'd, did not advise This prosecution, till my eyes Were fully opened by Asinus, Who did himself refuse to join us, Till I insisted his support Should be demanded by the court. Dama. Has not some comrade often found you With groups of cattle all around you, Urging their malice not to soften? Asinus. I've talked about it very often. Dama. You saw the Goat, some time before, Kiss Canis, at the granary door? Asinus. I never said I witness'd that; But I have heard he kiss'd the Cat; As the affection of Canis for the Cat has been several times mentioned in the course of this poem, and as that circumstance appears repugnant to the practice of these times, an explanation may be necessary. Know, therefore, that in ancient times, there was not that positive distinction among animals which exists at the present day; and in the Pug, the Greyhound, Lap dog &amp;c. we find the descendants of Dog and Cat. A particular fondness is said to have existed for the Lap Dog by all the brute creation, and especially the Cat. And notwithstanding the growing evil which the too frequently indulging this animal has occasioned, we find it continued even until this late period. Hence we account for the motley variety visible in almost every tribe of animals. Such conduct may some creatures suit, But I have never kiss'd a brute; They may permit a canine elf, But I will never do't myself. Ovis. Good reason why, unpolished brute! No decent sheep would let you do't. [aside. The Ass retired with gentle pace, And most serene unruffled face; Among the neighing tribes to stray, And barter rotten oats for hay; For where he fed, beneath a wall, He kept a kind of broker's stall; And when a brute, for lack of grass, Begg'd but a mouthful from the Ass, He'd give a scanty lock of hay, And take the suppliant's hide in pay. Of better mettle, but of grain More stubborn than the flinty plain, A Mule, of obstinate deport, Now stalk'd majestic into court, Attended by his gentle mate, On whose fair lips hung Mastiff's fate. This beast had roam'd the savage waste, And knew a thousand plants by taste; So undertook, nor fear'd of failing, To cure each beast of every ailing; And we had ne'er a quack to school us, So much admired as doctor Mulus. He took his station, as desired, And Cervus of him thus inquired: Cervus. Had you a conversation, sir, About this matter, with the cur? Inform the court if that's the case, How, when, and where the same took place. Mulus. I heard a conversation pass Between the Dog, the Cat, and Ass; For I was present, by request, To hear what talk escaped the rest. Cervus. What conversation did you note Concerning injuries done the Goat? Mulus. Asinus, Felis, Dog and all, Came, by agreement, to my stall, Some distance from the river shore— I'll tell the truth and nothing more. [earnestly. Cervus. Did Felis any charge produce From Capra, of the Dog's abuse? Tell us the Mastiff's conversation.... What said the Cur on that occasion? Mulus. The Cat charged Canis with the vice Of telling Capra, once or twice, How much he loved her....for which cause He'd find that she (the Cat) had claws; “For had you not, continued she, Made love to her as well as me, My own complaint had not come out”— Reyn. A little jealousy, I doubt. [aside. Mulus. Canis confess'd that some expressions Had dropt from him like love-professions, Which Capra had repell'd with scorn, Threatening to tell her Capricorn; To leave the fold, and take no more Her rations at the granary door. Reyn. We recollect these rations, well. Leop. What further from the Mastiff fell? Mulus. He said, in a peculiar note, “Capra's an artful, cunning Goat; But I could circumstances state To ruin Capra with her mate, And give her credit such a shock, That she'd be scorn'd by all the flock.” I ask'd the Dog, in great surprise, What gave to that assertion rise, For nothing had I ever seen, In Capra's conduct bad or mean. He answered thus: “I only meant That acts, which may be innocent, Might be display'd in such a light, That they'll appear as black as night; And should I something so display, Her reputation fades away.” But, added, when I look'd surprised, That such a measure he despised. “Take note of that!!!” Leop. Hold, doctor Mule! In this place you must bend to rule. And such impertinence again, Perhaps may meet a bit and rein. This is the second time that this expression occurs in the present work; and we cannot help observing, that, though Sampfilius might have been well acquainted with every equestrian appendage, still we cannot conceive how a Leopard should be so familiar with the terms. The Translator. Mulus. I merely by those words design'd, That it should not escape your mind. Three charges next Asinus made, The same which he has here displayed, Against the Dog, who heard them through, And then acknowledged....“it is true.” On that, with most pathetic bray, The Ass attempted to display The danger of his awful course, On which he dwelt with warmth and force. Canis replied, “I will confess, That I have err'd.... Vertagus. No Ass does less. [aside Mulus. “But must my innocence avow Of charges stated by the Sow.” As I some things began to urge, Bauin applied to stop a purge; And going to relieve the Bear, Mula, I found was listening there, Who said that she— Leop. That will not do, Do not tell us what she told you; But let us hear what next took place, When you'd prescribed for Bauin's case. Mulus. When I return'd, to please my mate, I let her witness the debate; Who ask'd, the moment she appeared, The meaning of the speech she heard, And what poor Capra had been doing, That Canis could effect her ruin? “Why, my dear sister, he replied, I only meant, that, if I tried, I could make things so bad appear, That she'd have every thing to fear.” And then he mentioned an affair To Mula known, about a Mare Who innocently suffered so, Above a year and half ago. My mate enquired if he had seen An action wanton, base, or mean, In Capra's conduct, or had heard Her tongue pronounce a naughty word? And vow'd, if that should be the case, The flock should bring her to disgrace. He answer'd Mula, that he had Known nought of Capra mean or bad; But that a beast, inclined to ill, Might consummate her ruin still. Then in an accent low and meek, With fallen tail and moistened cheek, He ask'd if we our rage would smother? “Forgive, he cried, a fallen brother!” Asinus readily agreed, And so we all forgave the deed; Bade him depart, and sin no more, And this affair should all blow o'er. The Ass proposed for one to go To Capricorn's, and ward the blow; I undertook it for my brother, Having more influence than another. Reyn. With Capricorn, or Capra, doctor? Mulus. I scorn your words, pedantic proctor! Reyn. I must request the court, I fear, To check your insolent career; I cannot tell, unmanner'd Mule! If you're a quack in physic's school; But that you're one in declamation Needs not the proof of demonstration. So now go on, with gentler pace. Mulus. I soon arriv'd at Capra's place, And told her that the whole affair, Through Felis' means, was taking air; And wish'd, if possible, it might Be buried in oblivious night. The Goat, in monstrous rage, on that Began to rail against the Cat, For thus exposing, to the fold, What she in confidence had told. She now would have to tell her mate, Before he heard another's prate; For if he got it first from them, Herself unheard he might condemn. Cervus. Did you return and tell the Cur, What past between yourself and her? Mulus. I told the Dog our conversation, And that 'twas her determination To tell her mate the whole affair; When he exclaim'd, in deep despair, “My ruin follows the disclosure! Will she persist in my exposure? My future fate, my life or death Suspended hang on Capra's breath; 'Tis hers to save, or else destroy My every hope of earthly joy. If you can do me any good, For Mammoth's sake, I wish you would!” I told him that he might depend On my exertions as a friend; And so we parted. Cervus. When had you With Capricorn an interview? Mulus. He came that evening to my stall, And said his mate had told him all. He seem'd composed, sedate and cool, But obstinate. Reyn. As any Mule. [aside Mulus. Resolved to seek for satisfaction, And institute a legal action. I used my rhetoric in vain His resolution to restrain; And so did Sister Nanny too, But our dissuasion would not do. He swore to make the Mastiff smart, And in that humor did depart. Cross examined by Leopardus. Leop. You undertake, on oath, to say You tried to do this thing away, And wish'd to have it quite forgot? Mulus. I do. Leop. But tell me, did you not Through all the wood pursue your rout, And bray malicious slanders out, To prejudice the beasts at large, Against the object of their charge? Mulus. Not till I saw a combination Resolved on virtue's degradation; Prepared the cause of vico to prop, While that of innocence should drop. Leop. Did not the fold expel you thence? Mulus. Not for the want of evidence On my behalf. Leop. I wish to know If you sought Mastiff's overthrow, Or in his service was sincere? Mulus. The Cat would tell you, were she here. Leop. You thought your agency would tend To serve the Mastiff as a friend? Mulus. I've told you once how I design'd it; If you want other language, find it. Reyn. Answer directly with precision— Did you think yours a friendly mission? Mulus. I did not think the Cat his friend, But never did myself intend To injure Canis in the least, Whatever names I call'd the Beast. Leop. You said you pitied and forgave him? Mulus. Yes, so I did, and wish'd to save him. Leop. But since have changed? Mulus. I think 'twas time, When Canis first confest his crime, And then denied what he'd confest. Leop. The moment Capricorn exprest His firm resolve to prosecute, You turn'd, and join'd in the pursuit? Mulus. I changed opinion on the ground That he had such supporters found, As would destroy, in his defence, The character of innocence; Virtue asperse, to ward his fate, And even implicate my mate. Mulus dismissed, and Mula called. Cervus. Madam, you'll please to tell the court Whate'er you know. Reyn. Except report. Mula. The cause of my intrusion, sir, Was merely this—I heard the Cur Tell Felis he could quite destroy The Goat's fair fame, and every joy; And easily effect her ruin. The doctor being call'd by Bruin, I ask'd him if he wa'nt ashamed To hear poor Capra thus defamed? And then requested his permission To join the little inquisition; Which being granted, I begun, And ask'd what act the Goat had done That he (the Mastiff) could destroy Her reputation, peace, and joy? The Mastiff answered—“you mistake; My meaning was, that I could make Some things, by glossing, seem so black, That Capra's fame would go to wreck.” The sun was set, and evening's shade Hung deepening o'er the narrow glade; The trees distill'd refreshing damps, The fire flies trimm'd their little lamps; The cricket tried his amorous note, The tree-toad tuned his hoarser throat; The bull-frog chaunted from the stream, Sparkling with Cynthia's silver beam; While whipperwills, from every grove, Taught Echo's voice the tone of love. Leo, fatigued with regal cares, A long dull day of law affairs, Required refreshing sleep's support, And so adjourn'd the savage court. END OF CANTO II. CANTO III. THE ARGUMENT.

Scene—as before. Time—about twelve hours. “Be Dog and Goat together tied; A hoodwink'd Ape with lash supplied, And while each stroke at random falls, The first that winces, cries, or squalls, Shall be the scoff of all the race. And held in abject low disgrace.” Sentence of the court. The morn, in purple glories light, Now burst upon the rear of Night, Who, gathering up his lurid vest, Retreated swift towards the west. All nature wakes from soft repose, The flowers their dews breasts unclose, Where insect tribes their votaries pay, And sip their nectared sweets away. The birds commence their matin song. And streams of music float along; Their grassy couch the herds forsake, To crop the mead, or taste the lake, And all commence the infant day, As toil or pleasure points the way; Till summoned by the Jackall's roar, The court assembled as before. Capra re-examined. Cervus. Capra, we call on you again, Some information to obtain, Why you have waited till this time Since Dog's commission of the crime, And hid his fault till this late season— Of this delay explain the reason. Capra. I feared the consequences, sir, Would be most dreadful to the Cur; And so assumed a seigned esteem, That none the truth might ever dream. The secret of my wrongs, untold To any member of the fold, So weigh'd upon my aching breast, That I had neither health nor rest; My spirits sunk beneath the weight, Till nature found the load too great. 'Twas then, (about six weeks ago) Finding existence ebbing low, To Felis I disclosed the fact, And begg'd her counsel how to act; But made her promise ne'er to tell The secret I had kept so well. Cervus. But first did she accuse the Cur Of having done the same to her? Capra. Yes, she confided first in me, So I could do no less, you see, Than trust her with my confidence, Though I repent it sadly since. Cervus. How came you finally to tell Your mate, whose rage you knew so well? Capra. After the Cat had thus betray'd it, I knew 'twas useless to evade it; And so to Capricorn confest The whole affair—and eas'd my breast. Cervus. Ovis affirms she heard a kiss, When once together—how is this? Capra. The time she mentions I can swear 'Twas she who kiss'd the Mastiff there, And when I charged her with the blame She begg'd me ne'er to tell the same. Cervus. Ovis, you know, has sworn she saw You coming from the Mastiff's straw; Explain that matter. Capra. 'Tis a lie— The Ewe was there herself—not I. Cervus. The Magpie swears you show'd a Stag Your dugs. Capra. What insolence in Mag! She knows that time I sulkled kid, And if he saw them—then he did. Cervus. The Goldfinch swears you kiss'd the Cur. What answer can you give to her? Capra. My mate was present at the time, And would he overlook the crime? Would he see Canis thus offend, And still remain his warmest friend? For such he was, I dare avow, In that affair about the Sow; Where I am sure (although acquitted) That Canis had the crime committed. Cervus. One witness has affirmed you cried “Adieu, my dear!—I'm satisfied.” Capra. I do not recollect it, sir; I ne'er in private saw the Cur, Except, as I have stated here, The time the villain bit my ear. Cross-examined, by Leopardus. Leop. You heard Columba here relate Remarks of yours about your mate; You said you had to kick and spur— Capra. I never said the thing to her. Leop. What say you of the river scene, After you both were wash'd so clean? Did you not nestle in his hair To screen you from the chilly air? Capra. He cover'd me to make me warm, And I had not a thought of harm; Had I suspected any evil, I would have butted like the devil. Court. You must have done so, then, 'tis clear, When he was rude, and bit your ear? Capra. I had not time, I fled away, I felt so vext I could not stay. Rubecula, the Redbreast, examined. Leop. My little Robin, please to state What you have heard the Ass relate. Rub. Ovis enquired of him, one day, What the poor Mastiff had to say; And whether he'd the whole confess'd, When thus the Ass himself exprest: “The Dog does not confess the fact, And still denies he did the act; He only owns he dropt expressions Which might amount to love-professions.” And this I heard Asinus say, Some time since the confession-day. Leop. Call up the Snipe. Dama. She's here at hand. Leop. Sweet Gallinago, take the stand. Tell what you know. Gall. I ask'd the Ass, Who came my way about some grass, If Canis had confess'd his faults; He told me he denied assaults, And every thing akin to force, But merely own'd some loose discourse. And then Asinus added to't, That Capra was a shocking brute; Obscene in talk, and rude to boot. Scolopar, the Woodcock, examined. Scol. My Gallinago spoke correct, And I, besides, can recollect How zealous in the Mastiff's cause This very same Asinus was, His crime, he told a dozen birds, Was merely trifling, foolish words, For which no creature ought to smart, And he forgave him from his heart. The Translator must here express his regret for the unavoidable omission of several pages of this interesting trial. But although he has searched high and low for them, they cannot be found. There is but one chance remaining for their existence—They might have been accidentally left with the boatmen, on the Mississippi. The translator has dispatched a courier to Fort Pitt, and another to New Orleans, to make enquiries on this subject. Should these messengers be successful, the public shall be furnished, without delay, with the object of their search, neatly printed in a supplement. Until that auspicious moment, they are requested to suspend their curiosity, and pass on to the remainder of the work.—From a careful perusal of the original, immediately following this unfortunate hiatus, I find, that the Fox has arisen to address the court on the part of the defendant; that he has summed up the evidence, and thus proceeds in addressing the jury: “You are not summon'd to decide Whether defendant be allied To the fleet Pointers of his nation, Or as a Cur deserves his station; This would be usurpation rude, And on our monarch's rights intrude, To whose prerogative alone Belong the means to make it known. Nor are you to emblazen forth Defendant's worth, or lack of worth, In character, or orthodox, As guardian of his fold and flocks; This is for those who placed him there, Confiding in his trust and care: And those who dare this right invade, Should to all beasts a scorn be made. You've simply to decide the facts, Whether defendant did the acts; And did the acts with rude intent, Against the plaintiff's own consent; For in the law, by legal course, Assault and battery rise from force; And where no force is used, 'tis plain, No cause for action can remain. “'Tis requisite, in your decision, To give the evidence revision, And make an honest calculation Of Capra's worth—in reputation. Who is this Capra? Horned jury, 'Tis painful business, I assure ye, To urge enquiries which embrace A fellow-creature's sad disgrace. But when a female, dead to shame Will thus the public notice claim; When she enlists in such a cause, Not for the love of virtue's laws, But for the purpose of destroying The fame which others are enjoying, Tis ours the question to pursue.... Who is the prosecutrix?...Who? On her own statement, she's a beast Who'll bear an insult well at least; And live in friendship with the brute Who treats her like a prostitute; Conceal his insults from her mate, For nearly three years after date. If we can credit her report, Made here on oath before the court, She bore with patient resignation A wrong of deepest aggravation; Permitted her chaste matron ear The wrong repeatedly to hear; Endured a base attempt at force, And yet pursued her friendly course, And still the treacherous wretch carest Who thus profaned her virtuous breast! Her guardian, too! whose sacred duty Was not to taste, but guard her beauty, In whom she saw a fiend of night Clad in habiliments of light! It was a crime against her mate, The partner of her wayward fate; An insult to her Mammoth king, From whom our various blessings spring; And yet, surprising to relate, She never told her tender mute; Nor do we hear of such a thing As her complaining to the king: The angel still, unknown to evil, Associated with the devil! Two years roll'd on, and all was peace, Her friendship suffered no decrease; No cloud obscured the atmosphere, No storm of rage did yet appear; (And still, 'tis seen by all the jury, She's got the temper of a fury.) Why, sirs, the story of this Goat Will cut her own polluted throat; It cannot stand....the truth has weight To make it sink in spite of fate. 'Tis loaded with intrinsic proof, Either that insult kept aloof, Or that, if it approach'd her breast, 'Twas there invited and carest. “Such is the Goat, on her report, Believing what she told the court; What is she by report of those Who in support of Canis rose; Who even modesty discarded, That justice might not be retarded? Gladly would they have shunn'd the task Of stripping vice of virtue's mask; But when they saw their friend must yield, Should they abash'd desert the field, They chose the treacherous snake to slay, And save her charm'd, bewildered prey. By them, this Goat appears to hold No claim to virtue in the fold: She has those very teats exposed Which she complains that Canis nosed; She has declared, she feared her eyes, Would show how warm her wishes rise; And that she dared not be alone With any male, except her own. But these foul stains are snowy white, Compared with others brought to light.... She stands convicted of complaining (Not while the gloom of night was reigning, But in the open light of day) That Capricorn could not allay The flames of lust which fill her veins.... The fire that in her bosom reigns!!! And yet, she can of virtue prate, And has the hardihood to state That force against her had been used, And her fair chastity abused!!! Why, gentle Bulls, as well might you Complain of all the Heifers, too; With the same justice, too, might I Complain that Chickens cannot fly; Or Felis, while she roves the heath, That Rabbits jump between her teeth! “The prosecutrix, we are told, Six years ago first join'd the fold; Which she found happy and united, And every member much delighted With their good shepherd, whom they bring From court....first chaplain of our king. He came, with royal honors deck'd, This flock to foster and protect; He came, inspired with honest zeal (In my opinion) for its weal; To teach them where to rove and feed, To crop the grass, or shun the weed; To taste the brook....and never stray, Lest lurking danger guard the way. Such was the flock, as Heaven design'd it, When this pernicious Capra join'd it. Scarce had she entered, when, behold! We find a serpent in the fold, Whose hell-born art of fascination Was levelled at the highest station; She mark'd her victim, and began To prosecute her treacherous plan. Though, with the sheep, in Erie thrust, Its waters had not cool'd her lust; And she her scheme so well pursued, I marvel Canis wa'n't subdued. She kiss'd him, to awake desire, And fed, with richest food, the fire; On his retirement has intruded, And to her own the Dog deluded; In short, combined such charms together, As might inspire a stupid wether. “Still the defendant did not fall.... For, had he yielded to her call, The fiend of lust had been appeased, And Capra with the Mastiff pleased; No prosecution had been seen, Nor love have changed to hate and spleen. But he rejected her desires, Till they assumed infernal fires; Her blasted hopes were turn'd to rage, And she resolved this war to wage. Panting for vengeance, still she fear'd The Mastiff was so much revered, That her bare, unsupported tale, Would in the cause of vengeance fail; And, therefore, potent means devised By which the Dog might be surprised. Could he be frightened to confession Of any action like transgression, She thought the work would be complete, And Canis would with shame retreat; So organised an inquisition, Of beasts just fitted for the mission. Felis, a Cat of tarnished fame, Whose jealousy she could inflame, Was chosen as a proper tool, Asinus next, and then the Mule; The latter from the flock expell'd, She knew would gladly take the field; While she could lead, whene'er she chose, The meek Asinus by the nose. The council met, in dread array, Their accusations to display, And taking Canis by surprise, They conjure up before his eyes, A host of dangers that await His hardened, unconfessing state; Till, quite bewildered, he confest Some foolish speech he had exprest; And thus confiding— Here is another deficiency in the Arabic MS. The remainder of this excellent speech seems to be lost, and two others, noted in the argument, must have shared a similar fate, to wit: that of Leopardus, on the part of the defendant, and that of Ursus, in summing up for the beasts, on the part of Capra. The Martin, for the prosecution; appears to have closed the observations, a part of whose speech I am enabled to translate, the commencement of it being so defaced, that it is impossible for me to decypher it. He thus proceeds: “This Goat, it seems, saw fit to call And visit Canis at his stall; Who begg'd a private chat to hold “On matters that concerned the fold.” Confiding in him, she retired, And he with wickedness inspired, Assail'd her virtue! lick'd her tests! And almost scared her into fits! And what excuse did he prefer For such assault? The treacherous Cur Attempts to prove our Mammoth king Would pardon such a trifling thing: But finding his intreaties vain, This virtuous Goat's consent to gain, He next this awful threat applies; “If you your reputation prize, Keep this a secret...or I swear, By the official garb I wear, I'll tell the flock, and they'll believe it, What damns your fame...you can't retrieve it.” Besides all this, to gain his ends, He thus the horrid act commends: “If I, your shepherd, dare commit it, Sure your own conscience may acquit it; Why, I have twice perform'd the thing, And yet am honored by the king; So far from losing reputation, I've been promoted to this station.” He then the well-known fable brought, About the mouse by Lion caught, To demonstrate that any ill Can find forgiveness, if we will. “Tis stated that a combination Is formed to blast his reputation: I'll grant it...but 'tis not my client, Nor yet the Ass, or Mule, rely on't, Who form this combination....No! Those who have plann'd his overthrow, Are his own counsel and the throng Of evidence they brought along; Whose tales have shock'd each modest ear, And call'd forth delicacy's tear; Thrill'd every virtuous heart with grief, And damn'd the Mastiff, past relief. “And first, fair Ovis...her report Can never influence such a court; Suppose that Capra ask'd the Cur, As Ovis swears, to visit her; Suppose he shared her choicest food, Does't follow that the Goat was rude? No...Ovis, by her evidence, Pourtrays herself the slave of sense; A loose, light, giddy, wanton ewe, As e'er disgraced the bleating crew; The “weak spu” story I despise As I do her that gave it rise. As to the Magpie's declaration, It merits no investigation; And Poll, the Parrot's, is so vile, To touch it would my tongue defile. The Pigeon is a pretty bird, But when her vulgar tale I heard, So foreign from her honest duty, I could not but forget her beauty. The Ringdove's story claims attention.... For if 'tis more than mere invention, It proves, in spite of all they say, That Canis met the Goat half way. Numidica, the Turkey's tale, If you believe it, cannot fail To damn the Dog...for she affirms, In the most plain and vulgar terms, That Canis aid commit the act.... What! another deficiency! Gentle reader, it's not my fault. When I commenced the translation I thought the work was perfect and entire; but now find, to my great mortification, that more than half the third Canto is missing. Even Leo's most excellent charge to the jury is involved in the same fate, excepting a small portion of it, in which he sums up the evidence, and explains the law, in a most masterly manner. He then goes on to reprobate the immoral tendency of such trials upon public morals, and concludes in the following manner: “And lastly, gentle Bulls, if you Believe that Canis did pursue The lecherous course imputed to him, Your verdict must, and will, undo him. But if, again, 'tis your opinion, That Capra, under lust's dominion, Invited what she now calls force, You must acquit the Dog of course.” Sampfilius then informs us, in a note, that the jury retired about midnight, and after consulting on the subject an hour, returned into Court and delivered the following verdict by their foreman: “The jury, having weigh'd the cause, By justice, truth, and virtue's laws, Beg leave to state, that all their talents Can find no difference in the balance; And so this verdict bring on oath.... “The Dog and Goat are Guilty both.” “Since that's the case, the judge replies, With me alone the duty lies, First to exhort you to repentance, And then declare our final sentence; “BE Dog and Goat together tied: A hood-wink'd Ape with lash supplied, And while each stroke at random falls, The first that winces, cries, or squails, Shall be the scoff of all the race, And held in abject, low disgrace.” END OF THE POEM.
