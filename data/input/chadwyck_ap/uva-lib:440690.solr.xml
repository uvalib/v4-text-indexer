Scene I. âThe Roman encampment in Gaul. Tent of Acilius. Enter from tent, as if in conversation, Acilius and Otho. Acil. Such is the peril, Otho, to our arms, Should these fierce Gauls compel us to engage Ere our new levies reach us. What advise you? Otho. Why, when the strong arm fails, the subtle brain Must make its failure good. In short, my General, A happy stratagem might save us. Acil. Wellâ Invent one. Otho. No; a child could foil me in An intrigue. Put me on plain, easy workâ Fighting. Acil. These plotting Druids baffle us; And Gaul would see its life in Rome's protection But for their tyranny. Enter Marcus What is it Marcus? Marc. My lord, a vagrant Gaul, who tells us he Is a deserter, is within our lines And under guard. Acil. There keep him. What's he like? Marc. More an Iberian than a Gaul. He'd rather Poison than strike, or else his looks belie him. Otho. Come now, a true deserter, and no spy. Acil. (To Marcus.) Conduct him hither. [Exit Marcus Otho. 'Tis no patriot grief Stamps such a visage. Acil. Trust not to a visage. I've known the deepest villain in all Rome, Bearing so open and unwrit a brow, With voice so frank and hearty, smile so genial, You'd look for a lightning flash from yonder sky, Rather than guile from him. (Enter Marcus and Arnulf.) (To Arnulf.) Your name? (Arnulf glances at Marcus, as if to have him dismissed.) Go, Marcus. [Exit Marcus Now? Arn. Arnulf, my name. Acil. Your motive for desertion? Arn. Hate's my motive; A weakness, I admit but still I have it; Steady though fierce clear-sighted, though relentless Hate for inflicted wrongs. Acil. And who their author? Arn. The council of confederated chiefs,â Ambron, their leader,âNorma, the high priestess, Who has them all more abject than her hound At her least beck. Otho. And your offenceâwhat was it? Arn. It matters not! Yet, lest you doubt me, hear it: Lieutenant 'mong the Arverni, I withheld Gold due a comrade's widow; was for that Doomed to be scourged and branded,âthen degraded To servile tendance on the army, Desperate I threw myself at Norma's feet, for she Could save me, but she gave me to my ruin. Acil. Well, Otho? Otho. I believe him. Acil. (To Arnulf.) And does Norma Urge on the war? Arn. Proclaims what you'll deny not: The timely moment and your feeble state. Roused by her eager words the tribes are arming For a descent upon you that shall be Resistless as an unexpected torrent! But, mark me, Roman, 'tis a woman's will That guides the impending mischief. Acil. And what then? Arn. Then, put your hand upon the helm that guides. Acil. How? Seize her person? Arn. Nay, her will. Acil. By bribes? Arn. Bribes? No! Not bribes in your sense. This it is Hedged by her sacred office from the approach Of youths enamored, Norma now has reached The first rich bloom of womanhood, unwooed, But notâI fancyânot unwoo-able, If we may trust in gender. In her heart (Waiting its master as the rose its June) A world of sighs and tears and ecstacies Lurk to befool her, for she is a woman! And not fanatic zeal nor iron custom, Strong as they are, can bind a woman's will. Guess you my drift? Acil. But vaguely. Make it plainer. Arn. That duping awe, which frights the simple Gaul From gazing with a thought of mortal passion On Norma's beauty, would not dash the Roman. This briefly then: select some noble youth From out your ranksâand let his errand be To woo and wed the priestessâprivately.â As it perforce must beâfor she must break Her vestal vow first, and the penalty For that is death. But once his wedded wife He can subdue her to Rome's purposes, And through her wield or sheathe the Gallic sabre. Otho. A rare adventure for some gilded youth! And, in our present straits, methinks the scheme Were worth the instant trying. Acil. Try it then. Otho. I? I should scare her with my beardâand she Frighten me with her smoothness ten times worse. Acil. (To Arnulf.) What style of wooer would you have us send? Arn. A thorough manâyet not so absolute A man, he cannot freely sport with those Illusions that do catch a woman's heart, And make her dream (poor fool) there's such a thing As love,âO! endless and unchangeableâ A man, in short, can talk, and look, and sighâ Ay, weep if need be, in extremity. Acil. (To Otho.) Know you of such? Otho. I cannot on the momentâ Hold! Is not that Octavian? It is he! The man for this adventure! Acil. The rich knight Who seeks a battle as one would a revel, Flying from weariness;âcomes here to Gaul As to an ampler amphitheatre With games in which he too may bear a part. Otho. But still the man we seek. Let me accost him [Exit. Arn. (Aside.) Now, Ambron, mine shall be a double vengeance! Acil. And do your Druids, Gaul, in sacrifice Shed human blood? Arn. Once, freely; rarely now, Since Norma, paramount in war as peace, Holds them in check, nay, with extinction threatâ Acil. A moment wait. The chosen gallant comes! (Enter Otho and Octavian.) Octavian, many welcomes! Oct. Salutation! What wild work's this you've carved for me, my chief? Is this our Gaul? Well, Gaul, what evil spirit Has thrust into thy brain this villain plot 'Gainst Norma? Arn. Is't a villain plot, to find A husband for the lady? Oct. Husband? Husband? Arn. No lover will our Gallic women heed, Who sues not for the ampler title. They, Being uncivilized, have still an awkward Respect for chastity and nuptial faith. Oct. Do you hear that, my chief? A husband! I! No! Find some other victim for the frolic. What!ârun my neck into the noose domesticâ Stand coupled for a life-time with a woman! Not were she Helen and Pe-nelo-pe, Aspasia and Lucretiaâall in one! Acil. 'Tis to serve Rome; the marriage will of course Then be invalid by Rome's highest law! Oct. But not by that established here, my chief, A higher lawâa law we cannot break Without a chafing and aâTell me, Gaul, Did you ne'er feel, before a scoundrel action, A something pulling, tugging at your heart To bring it right, though never conquering In the unequal contest? Arn. War, my lord, Levels all nice distinctions. Stratagems That would be base, as between man and man, Are to a General's honorâif successful. Oct. Success! Ay, that's the consecrating charm If I do fail, my crime is but a crime; If I succeed, 'tis inspiration, glory. The gods think otherwise:âbut pardon meâ Believe you in the gods? Arn. Religiously. (Aside.) That is, not at all. Oct. You look like a pious youth! The gods take up the threads of consequence To our triumphant sins; and retribution Comes, shod with woolâbut comes.âI play th' haranguer; Forgive me, friends; I'll further probe this scheme And straightway join you. Otho. (Aside to Octavian.) Things look bad enough. We snatch at straws. Do what you can to save us. [Exeunt Acilius and Otho Arn. (To Octavian abstracted.) My lord! Oct. Well, Gaul? Arn. I cannot urge it on you. The peril far outweighs the honor of't. You go aloneâyou cross the Gallic linesâ You seek the sacred grove where Norma dwells:â What are the chances?âThat before you reach it You're seized as a spy and slain. And, should you pierce Unseen to Norma's presence, there's the risk Your fair words may not raise the tender thought, Or even avail to save your forfeit life. Oct. True; there's the risk. Arn. And should you even succeedâ Should you win Normaâ(and believe me, Roman, The conquest might make even a CÃ¦sar proud)â You jeopard both your lives and make disclosure Twice imminent. Oct. Proceed. You argue well. Arn. (Aside.) Have I misread my man? (Aloud.) I've said enough For your dissuasion. Oct. Gaul, what see you there, Tied to the oak tree? Arn. There? A horse who chafes To break away. Oct. 'Tis mine. I go to mount him. Brief the time now between me and my object! Arn. Since you wilt rush to the venture 'gainst my urging, Take this, (shows a small parchment,) a chart, on which are dotted down The lines to guide you. Norma's mansion lies Upon the sunward border of this grove, Nestled 'mid roses, blossoms of the grape, And all the odor-shedding flowers and shrubs. Reach thatâand Norma's heart!âand you are safe. Oct. (Taking the chart.) Before I thank you, I must see more clearly The issue of this bus'ness. You can wait. [Exit Arn. Ah, my fine, fleering blade! for all your scorn I may requite you too in the general quittance.â So treads the future victor! He'll not fail. He takes a hurried leave of them;âhe throws Aside his martial trappingsâmounts his horse And gallops towards the outposts.âSo far well! Now must I get permission to lurk near And watch him closely, lest he do relent. [Exit SCENE II. A Druidical grove.âA raised altarâ, crowned with wreaths of flowers, evergreen, &amp;c. Norma on the stepsâ Adalgisa, and female attendants near. Druids on either side, and an outer circle of Gallic soldiers, standard bearers, chiefs, &amp;c.âRudiger, Gontran, Ambron, present.â A short strain of music as the scene opens. Norma. Thus do we consecrate your banners, soldiers! Not from an altar stained with human blood, Nor yet with sacrifice of beasts. The gods Abhor the ignorance which would win their favor By cruelty. No more of that!âWe bring Flowers of the spring-time, roses, blossoming boughs, And, wreathed o'er all, the sacred misletoe; Not as gifts needful to the gods, who have Their amaranthine bowers of endless bloom,â But as the symbols of our gratitude, Our worship, our dependence,âof the faith That keeps its living green 'mid desolation And clings, though storms would tear it, to the creed Of life in deathâof immortality!â Not silent are the oracles; the omens All smile propitious on you, and the answers, Vouchsafed my prayers, promise an easy triumph Ifâif you seize upon the instant time. Wait not beyond to-morrow! In delay Thenceforward there's a gloom impenetrable. (Norma descends from the altar.) Then rally, Gauls, and rush upon the foe! For homes, for hearths, for wives and babes, you strike,â For your free altars and your sacred groves,â And, above all, for priceless liberty! You go not forth to ravage, but to rescue; Not to make desolate a smiling land And give to the sword old men and shrieking virgins; But to avert from your own native soil Such horrors. Then each heart's resolve be this: No footstep backward till the field is won. The benedictions of the gods be on you! Like bucklers be our prayers! The rites are ended. [Music.âNorma and her train pass out; after them Druids and soldiers, except Rudiger, Goutran, and Ambron; the latter in the background. Rud. The rites, the rites! Gontran, she said the rites! Music for shrieks, and flowers for hecatombs! Water for blood, and prayers for mystic orgies! And these are all the rites to win the gods To favor Gaul's last stake! By such girl's pastime We hope to make our fathers' gods propitious! O, Gontran, you and I have seen the day, Beneath that oak, festooned with roses now, Fit for a lover's, not a warrior's tryst, A hundred human lives were offered up And all this ground was crimson. Gont. I remember. Did it avail though, all that blood and anguish? Did we not lose the battle? Rud. Ay, we lost it. Butâbut we had not heeded well the omens I tell thee, we may date the swift decline Of Gaul and of the Druids from the day, Beguiled by Norma, we refused the gods A human life in sacrifice. What I, What all the Druids now? unheeded idlers, Superfluous to the system that a woman Is building up! Ambron. (Who has approached.) That's very true. Rud. Ha! Ambron? Amb. Since you deplore the past And think the gods are craving human blood. What if I give them some of yours? You shrink! Ere now I've heard your mutterings. You're of those Who're ever prating of the good old times When the priest's function was to play the butcher. And he could juggle fools with consultations Of reeking entrails. Now, the country's ruined Because your filthy shambles are denied you; Because (so you'd persuade us) the great gods Are coy for lack of carrion. Do ye hope Again to sink us to such idiot frenzies? Rud. Frenzies? Without the Druids and the culture They gave the people, you and yours had been Slaves, savages! Our fathers wrought those frenzies. Amb. Our fathers dwelt in caves, went clad in skins, Roamed like wild beasts for forage. Thanks to Norma, Your day of blood is over. Rud. For the present, I do admit it, Norma has the power. Amb. How gained she it? How gained the people's trust, The army's reverence? Where you told us lies, She told us truths. Where you did prophesy Falsely and wantonly, her careful words Found their fulfilment. Where to wounded men You brought your incantations, she brought skill In bandages and herbs and applications That soothed and healed, while you could only mutter. Tempt me no farther by maligning Norma. I do endure you only, not approve. Beware lest I do sever with this sword The slender hold you yet have on the people. I know youâthey shall know you, if you tempt me. [Exit Rud. Are we not fallen indeed, constrained to hear And to endure such contumely? Weâ Your Druid teachers, Gontranâonce supreme! How long is't since Gaul's proudest chief would kneel To kiss our garment's hem! And nowâAll thisâ All this is Norma's work! Ambron himself How docile once and reverent! Hear him now! She has bewitched him! Gont. With an honest witchery,â Her charms! Rud. Ha! Should there be a mutual spell! Should she, in her supremacy, infract Her vestal vow!â Gont. Well: she is absoluteâ The people would believe no wrong of her. Rud. I know not that. Give us that hold, and thenâ Let her be watched! And Gontran, be thou sure Thy star shall culminate as hers and Ambron's Plunge in the wave. Come! We will bide our timeâ The ancient Druid oak has some sap left. [Exeunt SCENE III. The front of Norma's cottage. Enter from the cottage Norma, meeting Adalgisa, who has entered. Norma. Now Adalgisa, why this breathless haste? What is it? What has happened? Adal. In the grove, Sacred to you, O Norma, and your women, I met a man. Nor. One of the foresters Who license have, at certain hours, to be there. A bright discovery, girl! Adal. No forester, A noble chief, more like; though simply clad. Nor. Did you not give the alarm? Adal. He pleaded with me In words so strangely fluentâ Nor. Adalgisa! You parleyed with him then? Adal. I could not help it. He seized my hand,â Nor. And you did let him hold it? Adal. I was bewildered. He was on his knees,â Nor. You let him kneel? Adal. Imploring me to hear him Ere I betrayed. Nor. How could he pass the guard? Adal. Many were absent at the consecration. Nor. True. I forgot. What Gallic chief would dare Profane our grounds? Adal. O, priestess! he confessed Himself a Roman. Nor. Ha! most like, a spy! He must be tracked. (Going.) (Enter Octavian, unnoticed by them.) Adal. (Withholding Norma.) Wait but a few short moments. Poor at the best his chances of escape! Oct. (Aside.) And 'tis for me she pleads! Adal. (Seeing Octavian.) Ah! This is he! Nor. Intruder! Is your life so vile a thing That you thus venture where 'tis forfeited Beyond redemption? Oct. Nay, I hold it precious, But 'twere a cheap exchange for this encounter. Nor. 'Tis doubly forfeited: first as our foeâ Oct. Not thine, O noble lady! Nor. Then, as daring To invade these precincts. Adalgisa, go Summon the sacred guard. ... Wilt thou obey? [Exit Adalgisa reluctantly. (Aside.) He heard me, yet he heeds not! (To Oct.) Are you mad? Found here, your life will not be long enough For a last prayer. Fly, Roman, while you may! He will not stir! Do you then court your doom? Oct. 'Twill not be hard, after your anger, lady. Nor. My anger? I'm not angry. I could weep, tho', Vexed to thus see you trifle with your time. Away! Oct. To be thus banished from your presence, Is it not worse than death? Nor. Then stay, perverse one, And give a woman's eyes the spectacle Of a swift, violent end! .... Why are you here? Oct. Thou see'st:âto look on Norma! Nor. Every moment Speeds on your danger. Hark! Oct. Regard it not. Bear with me through the interval, and then Let the swift death come down! Nor. Inexplicable! Were you a spy,â Oct. I should not linger here! Nor. Your name? Oct. Octavian. Nor. And your birth-place? Oct. Rome. Nor. The worse for you! Rome? The imperious city! The splendid murderess! Sending armies forth To earth's remotest climes to kill and ravage, Enslave and plunder and depopulate! Rome? Malediction, ruin and despair On Rome! In what have we offended Rome? Have we infringed her borders? Threatened herâ Wronged her in any way? She cannot say it! But the gods do not sleep. Rome's day will come! Oct. Couldst thou but see Rome in her glory, lady, Her temples, arches, amphitheatres, And the full tide of life that throbs and pours Along her avenuesâ Nor. What to me her pomp? Temples? We have them in our groves of oak, Ampler than her Ca-pito-line. For arches, Behold the vista of yon stately trees! And, would you see an amphitheatre, Pause on the slope of yonder towering hill! Oct. Fairer than all, the abode where Norma dwells! Here might the wanderer pause, and cry content! Fate! give me here to dwell, and let the world Roll on with all its pageants. Every tree, The vines, the trellised roses, and the shrubs Do seem more fragrant and more beautiful Because of Norma's love and Norma's care!â If I did vaunt Rome's grandeur, 'twas to add That yonder bower were dearer to Octavian Than her imperial gardens. I could tell thee Such tales of Rome, her glory and her guiltâ Her heroes, poetsâ Nor. (Subdued.) Poets? Oct. Hast thou heard Of any? Nor. Ay! ... Hark! Leave me! You refuse still? Have you no friends, no kindred will deplore you Looking for your return, long, long in vain? Oct. Remind me not of that. Nor. Have you no mother? Oct. Ay, one so fond, she spoiled me. Nor. You've a sister? Oct. A precious one! Nor. And you've perhaps a wife? Oct. No, on my soul, no wife. Had I a wife, I had not ventured thus. Nor. What frenzy led you Into this hazard? Oct. Love ... I dreamed of Normaâ Dreamedâbut her presence beggars all I dreamed Of noble and most lovely. Nor. Trebly forfeit Is your life now. Oct. I know it. Nor. Sacrilege Is in your words. Oct. I know it. But consider: If I approach thee with less awe than love, To me, adoring other gods than thine, Thou'rt but a peerless woman, not a priestess. Nor. So! I begin to fathom you. You hope, I, in my woman's weakness, now will spare you Because of these soft flatteries, coined so aptly. Oct. Lady! a taunt upon a Roman's courage Is sharp as one on Norma's purity: To any face but hers I'd say as false. (Going, and speaking in a loud voice.) What, ho! Who hears? Nor. (Stopping him) Hold! Hush! Oct. Sound the alarm! Come forth! Nor. I do beseech you! Oct. Will none hear? Nor. I wronged you. Pardon me. Oct. O! pardon me, Bright excellence, that thus intruding, I Have dared toâ (Enter Adalgisa.) Nor. (Eagerly.) Adalgisa! Back so quickly? Are they at hand? Speak! Do I hear their tramp? Thou'rt prompt, when human life is in the balance. Adal. Such labyrinths the foresters have made! Running with headlong haste, I missed the path, And took one that has brought me here again. Oct. (Aside.) I knew she'd miss the path Nor. And thou art here, Thy errand unfulfilled? This thy obedience? Adal. Be not offended. Instantly I'll go And try again. Nor. No. I have those within Need not a second bidding ere they heed me. Go to the temple. Stay! No word, I charge thee, Of this event. Begone. [Exit Adalgisa There's yet a chance Of safety for you, Roman. Take that path, Keep in the thickest of the wood till nightfall, Then speed to your encampment. Oct. Quitting thee, Perchance forever? Urge me not to that. Nor. What would you do? Oct. Dwell near thee;âsee theeâhear thee! Nor. Impossible! This once, by a kind marvel, Detection has o'erlooked you. Such a chance May not again befriend. Oct. That is my risk. Here I remain. Nor. Audacious! On your head Then be your blood. [Exit Oct. Ha! Gone? Of all my shafts Not one sent home to the mark! Void all my art? How did I blunder in my wooing? Ovid! Thou art a traitor!âNo, thou'rt not.âShe comes. (Enter Norma.) Nor. (Aside.) Threats move him not: Persuasion may. (To Oct.) My purpose rests suspended You see! I shrink from pushing on the peril Your life already stands in: but be sure, 'Tis not for youânot that I care for you, More than for any straggler of your camp, That I recoil from seeing you struck down. Beware of such presumptionsâthey are dangerous. I show you mercy I would show to any. Oct. If Norma spares me but to show her scorn, 'Tis cruelty, not mercy. Nor. Solve me this: What should he do who truly loved me? Oct. Do? Lay down his life for thee as eagerly As crown his temples with the bridegroom's wreath. Nor. What's more than life? Oct. Love, honor. Nor. You say trueâ Honorâa woman's honor! Sully that With but suspicionâand she is a ruin. Innocent, she may smile on desolation And grow the prouder for the world's traducing. Guilty, she smiles no moreâexcept in mockeryâ And she is crushed indeed. You may suppose, Lacking Rome's culture, we more lightly prize Womanhood's crown of virtue: know then, Roman, The Gaul who's held a coward is less scorned Than she the wanton. If among the people, Bound by no oaths, obscure, unconsecrated, Our maidens keep a spotless fame, shall I,â Chief ministress between the gods and them And allâthus parley with the man who dares Accost me in a language which to hear Alone is crime? Each moment that you linger, While I omit denouncing and exposing, 'Tis not your life alone is jeoparded,â My peace, my good report, my sacred honor, Allâall are on the verge! Oct. (Aside.) She moves me!âNo! Not to save Rome will I molest her more. (To Norma.) I go. Forgive me, Norma. In my trespass, Believe me, not a thought of profanation Did mingle ever. In my heart I bear (If my good stars shall guide me forth in safety) Treasures not there before, for which I thank thee,â Thy image and the memory of thy goodness! Farewell! The gods, whose fit interpreter Thou art, defend thee ever! [Exit Nor. He is gone! Gone, too, with step as free as if he trod To sport instead of danger. Peace go with him! ... Tears? Did I weep then when he took his leave? Well: what of that? If he had been a beggar, Mean and uncouth, I should have wept the sameâ Indeed I should! I weep at veriest triflesâ A wounded birdâsome story of old timeâ Mere fiction, 't may be. (Looking off.) Ah! he takes the road Must lead to certain peril. (Calling.) Ho! Not that! The left! the left!âWith what a luminous smile, Yet sad, he waves his thanksâthen moves awayâ Away forever from me! ... Footsteps? Hark! Foresters? Ha! They go to cross his trackâ They will detectâarrest him. (Calling.) Roman! Stop! Return!âHe will not hear me, or not heed.â Roman!âWill nothing turn him then?âOctavian! Ah! now he hears. (Goes to the opposite side of the stage, listens.) Are voices this way, too? Ay, but too surely! Ruin all around! How shall I save him? Bid him enter there In my own sacred dwelling? Never! Rather I'd perish with him. Yetâ (Enter Octavian.) You've stayed too long. You'll be detected. Scouts on every side Traverse the forest. O! why came you here? I cannot shelter you. Impossible! Nearer they come, and nearer. Oct. Stay not, Norma; On me be all the peril. With my sword I'll make a lane through fifty foresters. Nor. Madness! Resistanceâdeath! Go in! go in! Quick! And hide there till nightfall. Oct. Noble lady, I thank thee, but I cannot. Nor. In, I say. Oct. A Roman, Norma, will not be outdone In generous daring by a woman. No! I'll not subject thee to the ruinous chance Such hospitality may bring upon thee. I'll meet them yonder. Nor. (Withholding him.) No. You shall not do it. Go in! Oct. I'll not. Nor. Go! ... if you love me, go! (Octavian abruptly goes in.) So! I've at last compelled him. But that wordâ Why did I give it utterance? Ha! how wildly My heart is throbbing, as 'twould leap to the light!â Footsteps again?âMy limbs sink under me. I've not the strength to drag meâwhere? Within? Into his presence? Oh! what powerful Fate Has of a sudden seized me in its arms? But it shall not detain me! Loose thy hold! Away! I will go free! I will. ... Ah me! Weak, weakâI faintâ (Enter Octavian, who supports her.) Oct. Let me support thee in. (As he supports her, voices are heard withoutâNorma breaks from him.) Nor. No! Go you in. I ask it. I will come, When I am calmer, and confer with you. [Exit Octavian; Norma in a different direction. END OF ACT I. ACT II. Scene I. âThe Gallic encampment. Soldiers gambling and carousing. Egbert looking on. 1st Soldier. Well, boys, the luck's against me. I surrender. I've nothing else to stake, unless it be My share of the Roman spoils. (They rise and come forward.) Egbert. The Roman spoilsâ When shall we see them? 2d Soldier. Next day after doomsday At this rate! 1st Sold. O! be patient. You shall haveâ All in good season, friendâa Roman pike Thrust in your midriff. Egb. Ay, and all the surer For waiting till the enemy are succored. I like not this delay. But two days since, And Norma promised us an easy conquest, Seized we the instant time. Now the wind's changed. Now, for some woman's reason, just as we Are eager for the grapple, we're held back, While every hour new levies may arrive To make our chances worse. 2d Sold. Let's tell our chiefs That we fight now or neverânow or never! 1st Sold. Particularly never, he would add, boys. (Soldiers laugh.) 2d Sold. (Angrily.) Come, I'll have no more taunting. 1st Sold. You alarm me. In every wrinkle, dignity! (Soldiers laugh.) 2d Sold. (Pushing 1st Sold.) Take that! 1st Sold. There, boys, this fellow wants a fight so badly, He'll e'en take up with me, since Norma holds him Back from the Roman. (Draws.) Stand, and see the fun. 2d Soldier draws. Other Soldiers form a ring.) Other Soldiers. Ay, ay, a fight, a fight! No crowding there! All ready now! Egb. Peace, brawlers! See you not Your general approaching? (1st and 2d Soldiers hide their Swords. Other Soldiers slink away. Enter Ambron.) Amb. What means this Unmannerly tumult? Quarrelling? No sooner A little freedom granted, than ye wrest it To your confusion, making it a curse? (To 2d Sold.) Blockhead, put up thy sword! (To all.) Hence, to your stations! [Exeunt Soldiers grumbling. Egbert goes to follow them. Stay, Egbert! Did my ears report untruly, Or did they catch complaining, mutinous words From an old soldier? Egb. What I said, my chief, I say: we're held in check to our own damage. Wound to the pitch, delay but slackens us. Each moment weakens Gaul, and strengthens Rome. Look at the soldiers! how shall they be kept, Left idle thus, from gambling and carousing? As well keep leaves from stirring when the wind blows! Amb. And if you'd fault to find, could you not speak it To your chief rather than to men aroused By a breath to good or evilâswayed as lightly This way as thatâimpulsive, unreflecting,â And who, but through obedience to the head That meditates and guides, would rush on ruin? Egb. The tongue, my chief, speaks bluntly when the heart Feels keenly; and this backwardness confounds me. Its object what? Amb. Though it be dark to us, The gods behold it clearly; and to Norma Confide their will. But while we speak, she comes. (Enter Norma. They bow low.) Nor. Hail, friends! Amb. Our troops, O Norma! are impatient To cope with Rome. They wince at this delay. This veteran Egbert hath himself grown restive, And, like a war-horse, panteth for the trumpets. Egb. Priestess, thy words were trumpets to my heart; And all the blame is theirs if I am restive. Kept loitering here, our discipline grows lax, And every moment makes the Roman stronger. What wait we for? Nor. (Abstractedly.) What wait we for? I know not. Amb. Egbert, it is the voice of heaven directs her, And never yet did it direct her wrong. Her omens are not drawn from slaughtered victims, From flights of birds, or accidents of nature, But from the unerring, the divine monition, Audibly whispered to the pure in heart: And that, for some good cause, now bids us wait. Nor. (Aside.) O, loyal soul! Didst thou but know thy words Were so like daggers! (To Egb.) Wilt thou be content, Egbert, and trust me? Egb. Wholly, noble priestess! Thy voice shall be as potent to restrain As to impel. (Riotous noise, shouts, &amp;c., without.) Amb. O, these unruly soldiers! The fickle knaves! To-morrow they will be Rampant for peace as they are now for war. (Renewed shouts and laughter.) Egbert, go still them. [Exit Egbert Norma, be not moved One jot by these seditions from your course. They're but the incidents to every camp, When ease and plenty meet. Nor. To-morrow, Ambron, If I may trust the present auspices I feel around me, you shall hear the word That shall let loose your army on the Roman. Amb. 'T is well. One word. I do mistrust the Druids; They love you not. Avoid them. Nor. Have no fear. Amb. Nay then, I'll watch them. Fools! They do not see You stand between them and the Roman, who Seeks their extermination, holding them The bar to Rome's establishment in Gaul. You heed me not. Nor. Go bid your soldiers, Ambron, Be ready for the morrow. Amb. They shall know All you have said. Nor. Farewell, then. [Exit Ambron O, how abject His noble presence made me! How I drooped Beneath those eyes whence only truth looked out! Why, as he spake of heavenly intimations Prompting my heart,âWhy did I not declare An earth-born passion drove it, and usurped All that to country and to heaven belonged! Yetâlike a juggler trembling for his trickâ There stood IâI!âSworn foe to all imposture, Who from false prophets and colluding priests But lately tore the maskâO, misery! My own face now must wear oneâflexile grow In feigningâI, whose consecrated lips,â Moved by a will not mine to utterance,â Proclaimed celestial messagesâI now Must counterfeit and palter, passing off My selfish and infatuated action For a divine constraint. O, never! never! Ere 't is too late I'll break from this delusion; Ay, though the effort's cost should be his life! [Exit SCENE II. A walled garden. Norma's arbor on one side. Enter Octavian from the arbor. Oct. O! this kind Nature, with her wealth of verdure, Her summer odors and her songs of birds, How she rebukes the purpose at my heart Would make of this abode a desolation! Under a false pretence I linger here, Planning a deadly ambush for the heart, (And that a woman's) that hath hazarded Peaceâlifeâto insure my safety;âthat hath waited In my feigned illness on meâlavishing All tenderness and sympathy. Beware! This is a double treachery thou art plottingâ First against Norma as a loving woman, Then as her country's trusted counsellor. But I too have a country!âMust I though Serve it at honor's cost?âBackâback to camp! In his good sword a Roman's trust should be, Not in base stratagems against a woman. (As he goes to the arbor, a scroll is thrown over the wall. He picks it up.) What 's here? Ha! From Aciliusâand for me! (Reads.) âNo reÃ«nforcements yet. Bad news from Rome. âPerhaps Rome's safety hangs on your success. âAt any sacrifice keep back the foe.â How! Rome in peril? And is this a time To falter in her service? to recoil, Through nice compunction, from a dubious task? Come, Powers that lend to mortal energies New life in time of need, attend me now! Let brain, tongue, eye, and every faculty Be prompt to help my purpose. 'T is for Rome, My country, Rome, I venture. If I tread In the event upon a woman's heart, What 's that, so Rome is saved? Rome before Norma! ... Could I love Norma? Heart, my heart, report! Dost thou beat high when Norma's step is heard? She comes. (Puts hand on his heart.) Yes, there 's a throbâanotherâwellâ What means it? Sea unknown! I cannot sound thee! (Enter Norma from the arbor.) Nor. To-night we part. You shall be safely led Beyond our lines. To-morrow, if we meet, 'T will be in the battle's midst. Oct. Recall thy words; Let us part never, if to meet as foes. Nor. Vain thy enchantments now! My dream is ended. Over my heart, Duty once more supreme Defies thee and thy arts. Oct. My arts? Nor. Thy illnessâ Was it an honest illness? How transparent Is its art now, and what a simpleton Was I to be duped by it! Oct. Granting it An art, in love, I say all arts are honest. Nor. I do distrust thy love, and half believe thee A Roman spy, here not for love of Norma, But to work ruin to her country. Ifâ If I knew thatâcould I but penetrate Thy secret thought, and find that hateful purpose, I'd string thee up on yonder blasted oak As readily as stamp upon this turf. (Tears.) Oct. Tut, tut! Thou wouldst not do it. Nor. Would not do it? Oct. Well, then: I am a spy. Nor. I'll not believe it. Oct. I knew it would be so. Fit harbor for a spy a lady's bower Wherein to learn the enemy's strength and plan! Since we must part, and part, most like, forever, And part at once,âO! let me bear away, Not the remembrance of an angry threat And a wild frown from Normaâlet me rather Take as her parting testament a smile Or, better still, a tear. (She weeps.) The precious token! She gives it! I'm content. And now, farewell! (Going.) Nor. One word. I had been happier, methinks, Had we ne'er metâand yet I will not blame thee. Heed not my threatâa flood of tears rebuked it Almost before 't was uttered. So, forgive me, And, in thy far-off Rome, 'mid all her splendors, Her temples, and gay throngs, and festal games,â Sometimes remember Norma. Oct. Needless charge! Remember? Hast thou not some drug or spell Will force me to forget her?âfor, my peace Were by oblivion better warranted. Hear my last plea, if last thy word shall make it. (Takes her handâshe withdraws it.) May I not hold it in a parting grasp? (He takes it again.) O! 'mid these scenes of war and violence, These gatherings of rude men, who trade in bloodâ Dost thou ne'er dream of a serener fate, A home for love to nestle inâafar From human strife and wrongâwhere wedded hearts Might every day find fresh felicity In their own peace, and gratitude to heaven? I've dreamed of such a lotâand with it came A sickness of the very soul at tasks War puts upon usâbidding us go forth To kill our brother manâto burn and ravage, Blast and exterminateâand all for what? (Norma withdraws her hand.) For land, gold, pride, dominionâwhat you will! Is it not monstrous? How can duty bind us To follow such a calling? Nor. Ay, 't is monstrous. But, when for home, for liberty we strive, Welcome the carnage! With this woman's hand I'd smite the tyrant would enslave my country.â Return to Rome, and preach thy doctrine there. 'T is a good doctrine. Heaven speed on the day When it shall be a law to all the nations! Oct. Be not unjust to Rome. Look to the annals Of thy own countryâwar her constant stateâ Battles on battles, till the clue is lost! Should Rome retire, some petty neighboring tribe Would lift the torch of war upon your borders. Nor. True, true; it is too true! And I have wept To think how feeble was my arm to stay These bloody strifes. Sick too am I of war! Oct. And, should you sweep away Rome's present army, Think you she has no other? Twenty such! In Rome's protection lies your only hope Of peace and progress. Rome's capacious arms Take in as children and free citizens All who receive the mild yoke of her laws. Nor. (Aside.) This man will make me, heart and brain, a traitor, If I do listen longer. Oct. Peace alone, With its secured rewards, its industry, Can lift your plundered and war-ridden people To social order, freedom, happiness. Rome can give peace. Norma, give Rome the power! End, since thou canst, this misery of warâ And thenâ Nor. And then? Go on. I see your object now. Oct. And I avow it freely! I would win Norma for Rome, but chiefly for myself. And, let the issue be for peace or war, (Kneels.) Thus kneeling at her feet, I offer her A husband's handâher loving slave forever! Nor. (Aside.) The fearful peril I am in! To hear Such words from himâwithout a shudder hear them! (A trumpet sounds without. Octavian rises.) Hark! in that note my country summoned me. O, gentle stranger, not for me that lot Which thou hast offered:âlonely, cold, but plain My way of life before me stretches. Here, Among my people, humble and uncultured Although they be, my duty lies. Oct. Then here Be my tent pitched! Grant but my suit of love, Thy duty shall be mineâthy people mine! Nor. Ah! (Covers her face with her hands.) Impossible. Devoted from my youth, By pledge paternal, to a virgin life, The cry of sacrilege would now go forth Against a change of destiny. Oct. The change May be kept secret. Norma, canst not thou Sacrifice something, if I give up all? (She slowly gives him her hand.) O, gift too precious! Am I not the dupe Of my wrought senses? No! 'Tis Norma's hand!â (Puts a ring on her finger.) This ring shall be an emblem of the circle Of sacred love I draw around thee now, Hedging thee in my own, and only mine! Nor. (Withdrawing her hand.) What have I done? Into what darkness plunged? Roman! if here my divination failsâ If that's not truth that's beaming in thy gazeâ Slay me at once in mercyâfor no heart Could hold the bitter anguish would be mine Finding thee false.âThat smile shall be my answer. Return now to thy camp. He waits without Who will conduct theeâwhom I'll send for thee When the time suits. Oct. And must the war go on? Nor. Rome shall decide; if, as you promise, she Will give us freedom, not my voice shall be Longer for war. I see a sunny gleam On the horizon, breaking through the clouds. Oct. Let it expand; for 'tis the harbinger Of a bright future to us both! Farewell! [Exit Nor. Ay, he spake truly. War on war succeeds, Let this be ended. Rome can give us peaceâ Can give us her own freedomâmake us part Of her own empire.âWhat a scheme it were To treat for such a union, and provide That he should be proconsulâmy Octavian! And thenâconcealment overâsuperstition And Druid power extinctâwe two might rule Like watchful benefactors, over Gaul. O! love's fulfilment and my country's welfare! Might ye thus join, with what a rosy hope Life were at once illumined!âGracious Powers! Who watch o'er human destinies,âbefriend me! Let not my vanquished heart betray my countryâ Let not my country's need claim all my heart! (As she is entering the arbor, a distant cry is heard.) Hark! Was it not a shriekâor was it fancy? A cry of terrorâtherefore not Octavian's! It chilled my blood though; and I'll learn its meaning. [Exit SCENE III. A Druidical groveâan altar in the midst. Present, Rudiger, Hagen, and other Druids. Rud. Not wholly powerless are we to observe Our ancient Druid rites, and offer up Other oblations than a wreath of flowers Unto our country's gods. Proscribed by Romeâ Distrusted by the people and the armyâ Humbled by her, who should have been our stayâ Born as she was beneath the sacred shadow Of our old oaks)âyet are we still the hope, The life-blood of the nation! Take away The Druid graft, Britannia gave to Gaul, And Gaul must perish. This the Roman knows, And therefore our extinction is his aim. While Norma urged the war that's poised 'gainst Rome, 'Twas well. She worked our will. But now, for some Inexplicable cause, she falters in This opposition, and holds back the army, That chafes to launch itself against the foe. Let her beware!âCome! to our country's gods Now let our ancient rites be once more paid In the ancient way. (Enter Norma.) Druids. Norma! Nor. I interrupt you. Have I broke in upon your little fÃªte? Unbind me yonder victim! Rud. Do not stir! Obey not, on your lives. Nor. What! Rudiger? Thou'rt he would have us think that the great gods,â Weary of their ambrosia,âthirst for blood. Rud. Beware! Presume not on thy power too far. Nor. Have I not said these orgies shall not be? I say it now! Release yon struggling wretch, Whom ye have bound for secret sacrifice, Or by the Power who made me, ye shall find Blood shall have bloodâthe slayer shall be slain! Am I to be obeyed? (The Druids whisper among themselves, and gather round Norma.) Hagen. Be patient, Norma. Nor. I've been too patient with youâfailed to use The means I have to sweep your superstition From the offended earth. Beware, lest I Bid Rome make Gaul her own. With Roman power To back me, there is not the grove so dark Should hide one Druid murderer from my rage. Unbind the victim, or ye follow him. Hagen. This, Norma, is the Druid's answer. (He attempts to stab NormaâShe throws him offâAmbron rushes in.) Amb. Hold! (Norma flies to him.) Which man will rush on death? Ye grave assassins! Look at your victim, yonder! He is free! Ye hardly can outstrip him in his speed. Would any take his place, why let him linger Another moment here. So! Are ye gone? [Exeunt all the Druids Nor. Ambron! Deliverer! Amb. Desperate as I knew them, I dreamed not they would lift the violent hand 'Gainst Norma's sacred life. Nor. And these are they For whom we fight! for whose deliverance From Rome's exterminating threat, this war (Disguise it as we may) goes on! The scales Obscure my sight no longer. Shall this be? Is it to float this Druid dynasty Gaul's blood must flow? Amb. Not mine, if Norma says it! They would have slain thee! O! most blessÃ«d chance That brought me timely here. They shall repent it. My clan will follow me through fire and blood. Say but the word, and not one Druid altar Shall be left standing. Nor. Leave their punishment To Rome's strong arm. Let us remain no longer 'Twixt them and Rome. Let us make terms with Rome. Amb. Do what thou wilt. I know what Norma does Has Heaven's approval. Have I not known thee, Norma, From childhood up, pure, wise, and faithful ever? Say war or peace, resistance or submission. Count on my voice and sword to uphold thee still. Nor. 'Tis well. I go to treat with Rome. Amb. Go! Treat with Rome. [Exeunt together, END OF ACT II. ACT III. Scene I. âA sumptuous tent belonging to Octavian. Enter from the tent Octavian, who meets Acilius entering the stage from Acil. Good morrow to the bridegroom! What a smile The day puts on to greet you! Oct. Ay, it smiles But not, like us, to ruin. We shall make A noble woman wretched. Acil. Thine the fault then! After the sacred rite that made you one, I held discourse with Norma, and to her Art thou indebted for a scheme that falls Within my perfect favor: she will use Her power to make of Gaul a Roman province, And thou, since I've the power of delegation, Shalt be proconsul. Oct. Proconsul! I proconsul? O, my dear lord, this tasks my gratitude Beyond all utterance. Acil. Thank thy wife alone. Oct. Wife! But that word sounds strangely. Acil. Cherish it. Though, marrying in the service of the state, Thou canst throw off the yoke, (if yoke it be,) Yet do I trust, of thy own choice thou wilt Accept her as thy honorable wife. Then, ruling her, 'twill be an easy thing To rule thy province. Oct. Yet remember this: 'Tis as a virgin priestess that she sways The people: let the whisper go abroad That she is wedded, shame and opposition Might be upon her track. Acil. Then leave to time The publication: wait till you are stronger, The people more enlightened: then divulge it. Oct. Yet do I fear that stealthy renegade, Arnulf, the Gaul. Acil. We'll pack him off to Rome Among the prisoners. He's of no more use. We love the treason, but we hate the traitor. (Enter Norma from the tent.) Norma, good morrow! and accept, I pray thee, A soldier's homage. Nor. 'Tis a joy to know That you're my friend. Acil. We'll carry out thy scheme; We'll leave Octavian here to rule in Gaul. Nor. And Gaul shall be as free as now she is? Acil. Gaul shall be Rome; and we of Italy Complain provincial Rome is more befriended Than we the central people. Nor. Do not think I would betray my country. Never! Never! But merged in Rome she springs to higher life; No more a campâa fluctuating tribeâ Rent by intestine broils and border warsâ Open to despot ravage and dominionâ But part of a great nationâpart of Rome. If in these words I show a swift conversion, And if to love I owe it, do not think 'Tis fixed on aught less firm than my persuasion. Acil. I heartily trust thee, lady. Fare thee well. Prize thy high fortune at its worth, Octavian! 'Tis time our scouts were in. We'll meet anon. [Exit Nor. So soon a dreamer? Whither stray thy thoughts? Oct. On to the future, Norma, the fair future! On to the heights to which thy hand has beckonedâ The heights proconsular! Nor. The way is clear; And, though the Druid faction may oppose, The people will be with us. Long enough Has priestly craft degraded them and plundered: O! we will raise them, liberate, enlighten. Walking by early light on yonder terrace I saw the sun yet crimson smite the mist Surging up from the valley: fold on fold Rose the thick vapor threatening to obscure The golden dawn,âyet see the laughing day! So shall Truth mount, and pour its blazing shafts Through Error's mist, changing each murky cloud To a white wreath of glory. We, Octavian, We will speed on the time shall bring that light. Oct. Enthusiast! with thy guidance I shall need No new Egeria. Nor. Ah! Oct. What thought was that? Nor. If I have lost my gift of divination! If the clairvoyant vision has departed! O! then, Octavian, these bright fantasies Are but the lure to ruin. I must leave youâ At onceâbefore my absence can be noted. Oct. I go to see the litter is prepared. Keep thy brave heart from drooping. Courage, Norma! Nor. Ay! 't was a passing mood. Go now. Oct. The future Shall to glad memories turn our present doubts. [Exit (Enter Arnulf.) Arn. (Aside.) As I surmised, 't is she! safe in the snare! How as her lover moves he bears along Her very soul in fond attendance on him! O, lady fair! briefâbrief shall be thy joy! At risk of his displeasure I'll accost her. I'll seize revenge while the brimmed cup is sparkling Close at my lips,âlest it be dashed away Forever.â(Approaches her.) Greeting to the priestess! Nor. Ah! What man art thou? Arn. Hast thou forgotten Arnulf? Come now, I feel the slight. Nor. This tone of insult!â (Goes up and calls.) Octavian! Arn. Hush! Learn but how much thou ow'st me, Thou'lt patiently attend. Nor. For good thou com'st notâ So much my heart assures me. Memory gropes In vain to join to some past act thy features. Arn. An officer of rank among the Arverni Fell into poverty and debt, for which The army's tyrant, Ambron, would disgrace him. Norma could save from ruinâfrom despairâ But she repelled himâsanctioned his abasementâ And gave him up to frenzy. Nor. I remember: But let me tell the tale. An officer, Bearer of a dead soldier's little store Of money for that soldier's family, Staked it at play, and, to the last denarius, Lost it. But did he labour to redress The wrong he had inflicted? He ignored it; Spurned from his pathway the beseeching widow, Laughed and caroused while those whom he had plundered Were common beggars. Now the gods pursue me With every wo, if I not use my power To reach and deal perdition on the caitiff Who, trusted with another's means which are His life, his children's future, perils them For his own gain or need.âAway with thee! Arn. O! I've not told thee half. Nor. And thou hast added Desertion to thy other baseness. Why Do I behold thee here in the enemy's camp? Arn. Why do I see thee here? Nor. Slave! I am Normaâ High priestess, and accountable to none Of mortal mould. Arn. And yet, methinks, a priestess, Pledged to a vestal life, who seeks a husband Within the enemy's linesâAh! Not at random Was that shaft sent! Nor. (Dismayed, goes up and calls.) Octavian! Arn. Wilt thou lose The best of all I have in store for thee? I spake of what thou owest me; thus it is: My instigation sent yon charming youth To play the loverâcheat thee of thy heartâ And crown thy treasonous passion with a marriage. A marriage! A mere stratagem of war! Binding while state necessity may prompt, Thenâflax in the fire! Rome's object was to gain Time to ward off the battle thou wert urging, Till her new levies should arrive. Nor. Ah no! 'Twas not a plot! Only thy base construction Would wrench it that way. Arn. 'Twas my plot, I tell theeâ Mine, Norma! that I might approach thee thus, And ask, are we not quits? Nor. Thy plot! 'Tis well. I thank thee for the assurance, as it takes The blame from one whose honor word of thine Should have been impotent to cast a doubt on. Arn. 'Tis pity from thy refuge of delusion To drive thee thus; but know, the Roman scouts Are in, and bring report, a reÃ«nforcement Is near at hand. Rome asks no more delay; (Enter Octavian from the tent.) And Norma, who has used her potency To ruin GaulâRome's purpose being servedâ Is now in the enemy's hands a prisoner, And soon shall be the common scoff of the camp. Oct. (With drawn sword.) Out, renegade!âI'll not profane my sword With thy foul blood.âO! gentle wife, forgive me That thou wert so unhedged by care of mine Such rude accost befell thee. Nor. But I knew 'Twas falseâfalseâfalse, Octavian. Sheathe thy sword. Nay, thou shalt not so soon resist me. Sheathe it. (He obeys.) Arn. (Aside.) Caresses! Blandishments! As I do live, Both are enamored! O, the yielding fool! The shallow milksop! In his own noose caught! And, after all my diligence of hate, Have I so blundered that my enemy Finds the bright crown of her felicity Wrought from the deadly substance of my curse? Oct. And didst thou think to make me the blind tool Of thy revenge?âAgainst a woman, too? A prisoner she? Thou liest! Unfaithful I? Again thou liest! Arn. The end's not yet, my lord. The time may comeâ Oct. If thou canst bring itâay! We'll circumscribe thy means. (Beckons off. Enter Soldiers, who arrest Arnulf.) The air of Rome Shall ventilate thy temper till 'tis sweeter. Arn. Rome! Well, dear friends, should we ne'er meet again,â Oct. We shall not languish. No more words! Away! [Exeunt Arnulf and Soldiers. Nor. Alas! that hate should be as strong almostâ Almost as love!âNo! Not as ours, for that, Attainment but makes stronger. Oct. And more strong! Come, Norma, all is ready for thy journey. I'll walk beside thy litter to the outposts, And we'll discuss the future. True it is An army of assistance is approaching. Nor. Therefore shall it be easier to make peace, And give to Gaul a ruler in Octavian. Oct. Who shall owe allâall to the hand beloved! [Exeunt SCENE II. A field. Enter to music Rudiger and DruidsâAdalgisa and WomenâGontran and Soldiers. Gont. Soldiers, our Druid fathers have convoked us, To offer weighty cause why instant battle Should against Rome be hurledâwhy your chief, Ambron, Should be deposed, and Norma no more heeded. Rud. Time was, the Druid need not have stood forth To show why his monitions should prevail. But we are here for action. Briefly then: Why is not Norma present? Why has her Loud, eloquent cry for war sunk all at once To pleadings for delay? This may enlighten: Yesterday she was tracked to the enemy's outposts. Men of Gaul, we're betrayed. She tampers with The Romanâand is even now, perchance, Haggling upon the price which he shall pay her For Gaul's enslavement. Ask ye proof of this? Her threat to us! Her absence from this meeting! And Ambronâwhere is he? (Enter Ambron.) Amb. Who summons Ambron? Rud. Behold him, pledged to follow Norma's biddingâ No matter where it leadâto war or peaceâ Fidelity or treason! Ask you why Ambron is thus devoted? Other thoughts Than reverence for her office mingle with His zeal in Norma's serviceânor is she Slow to requite his kindness. Amb. Slandering dotard! I had borne all but that! Not thy gray hairs Shall shield thee from my fury. Gont. (Interposing.) Nay! Amb. I thank thee. Age be his shield!âSoldiers, hear me proclaim The crime of Norma. She has even dared Say to these remnants of old wickedness. In your detested rites venture to shed The sacred human blood, and yours shall flow. They were but yesterday detected by her In disobedience. With indignant words She bade them loose their victim. They, enraged, And, thinking by one blow to feed their grudge And reinstate their stripped authority, Favored the act of one, who drew his dagger And rushed upon the priestess. She repelled him. And I came timely in to rescue her From the assassins. (Sensation among the Soldiers.) Rud. And the act of one. Unauthorized, uncountenanced, he brings Against us all! But does the tale disprove Our charge of treason? Where this while is Norma? She knows the charge is true. She will not venture To reÃ¤ppear before you. Amb. She is here! (Enter Norma.) Nor. I bring you peace, my country, peace and freedom. Rud. Whence? We may doubt the gift, knowing the giver. Nor. Rudiger, I salute you. When we met Last, 'twas a sharp response ye tendered me. Whence bring I peace? From Rome who brings the war! Rud. So! As I told you, soldiers! She has been Bargaining with the enemy. Nor. And why not? What will ye fight for, soldiers, should the war Go on? For Druid empireâhuman sacrificesâ Assassination, perjury, and plunder. At length the mist before my eyes is scattered. The Druids have deceived usâfalsely charged 'Gainst Rome, intents she never harbored. Come! Abandon this poor, tottering Druid system, Effete and doting, and Rome asks no more! Was it not time I bargained with the Roman When these men sought my life; ay, would have had it But for the noble Ambron! (Cries of âDown with the Druids! Down! Down with them!â) Amb. Let them retire unharmed, but be henceforth Druids no more, but common men. Ye will it! And so (revivers of the impossible past!) Depart forthwith, nor dare to abuse our mercy. (Druids, all but Rudiger, Exeunt.) Rud. While thrives the oak, the Druid shall survive. [Exit Nor. Then, to be free, my countrymen, we must Be part of the mighty empireâpart of Rome! Rome offers her adoptionâher protectionâ Her roadsâher fortressesâher means of plentyâ And to the soldiers, who will join her army, Double their present payâthe officers, Their present rank, with prospect of promotion. Ye have the offer. Shall it be accepted? Egbert. Ay, soldiers, ay! The thing for usâfor Gaul! (Cries of ay! from the soldiers.) Nor. Then go, give signal to the enemyâ To our friends, brothers, ratherâof the issueâ And with them interchange a soldier's hug. (Music and cries. Exeunt all but Norma and Ambron. The latter, when all have gone out, drops his sword. Norma picks it up and hands it to him.) Nor. Thou hast dropped thy sword. Amb. I've no more need of it. Nor. Then thank the gods and give it to its scabbard Against the time of need. Amb. (Receives and puts up sword.) O, Norma! Norma! Thou hast transformed me wholly. I who held In this right hand the destiny of Gaul,â Who hated peace as sailors do a calmâ I now give up my power, as 'twere a bauble I had outgrown. Nor. A noble sacrifice! Amb. Of no true nobleness the change is bred. Self, self, and always self, the only motive! O! be thou here the prophetess, and read What my tongue dare not utter. Nor. Speak. Amb. I love. I know there's profanation in this madness, But Druid rigor now is at an end And thou art free. Nor. Free, Ambron? I am bound In fetters past release. I am a wife. Amb. A wife! Nor. A secret this, my more than brother! Amb. One that more crushes than a battle lost. And yet, even here I trust thee. Who's thy husband? Nor. A Roman chiefâOctavianâsoon to be Proconsul here. Amb. A Roman! A proconsul! HowâwhyâI see it all! Heroic Norma! You wed Gaul's ruler, to secure Gaul's welfare. Nor. That hope, methinks, was foremost; yet it was not Unpaired with love such as a wife should bring. Amb. Felicity attend thee! May the gods Shower their selectest blessings on you both. Thou hast been much to meâhast made my life From contact with thine own more rich and sacred; So that my present sorrow seemeth better Than all the ignorant joy of former years. Dost thou remember what a mere barbarian, Rude in attire, in speech, in superstition, I was when first thou took'st me into training, Shaped my chaotic thoughts, my ruffian passions, By forms and intuitions of thine own, Till the rough savage grew to be a man And the brute life obedient to a higher? Now, must I lose my teacher? Nor. No. Why shouldst thou? Stay with us; still our army's honored chief. Amb. It cannot be. Among the mountains dwells My sire, a gray-haired peasant, with his flocks. Him I rejoin, to find in scenes of beauty And simple occupations (thanks to thee!) Contentment that in war and power abides not. Farewell! But should the dark hour overtake theeâ Should grief, disaster, reach or threaten thee, Then call on Ambron! He will keep the sword Thou didst restore. Farewell! Nor. Go, noble friend! We shall recall thee, soon; though not, I trust, At prompting of misfortune. Amb. So I trust. [Exit (Shouts from without.) Nor. Those shouts proclaim the meeting of the armies. Met, not in homicidal wrath, to stain The turf with carnageâbut as brothers meet. Shout on! ye lift my heart upâhigherâhigher! Octavian must be thereâmy husband! Soon, Proconsul over Gaul! Joy, Norma, joy! [Exit SCENE III. A Grove. Enter Adalgisa and Bertha. Ber. I shall miss all the show. Adal. Return, then, Bertha. Ber. A precious coward to fly because a soldier Chanced to stare at theeâsuch a soldier, too! Some chief of rank, be sure, among the Romans. He looked as he had cause to win some glance Of recognition from thee. Hast thou met him Ever before? Adal. Met him before? How could I? Ber. That know I not. This know I, Adalgisa, Eyes had he only for thyself of all Our white-robed companyâan oversight Quite unaccountable, my dear, since I Stood nearer to him by some two or three. Adal. 'Tis not for us to court such glances, Bertha; Our safety lies in flight. Ber. To be quite candid, I'd rather not be safe when such the danger. But look thro' the leaves. A line of burnished armor Is flowing, glittering, like a sunlit river By the grove's border. I can stay no longer. [Exit Adal. Ay, it was he. Too well do I remember That eager glanceâthose features. Brief our meetingâ But memories for a life-time followed it. Few were his words; but how like melodies They haunt my soul, and go before my prayers. And now he's here againâhere as a friendâ And he has seen meâmarked me;âbut my duty Lies plain before me, and I thus pursue it. (Going.) Till his departure from the land, seclusion Must keep me from his sight.â'Tis he again! (Enter Octavian.) Oct. Do not avoid me. We have met before. Adal. Good reason why we should not meet again. Let me pass on. Oct. Fair saint, 'twere irreligion To let thee pass, receiving from the gazer No word of adoration. When thou didst quit thy cluster of fair women, I was bereft even as the earth might be Should the moon vanish 'mid attending planets, And rob the night of glory. Adal. Why detain me? Oct. To get the assurance you again will meet me. For so much beauty taken from my life, Would leave it ugly and unprofitable. Adal. I cannot grant it. Danger to thyself And me, were in the act. Oct. Believe it not. The power supreme of Gaul rests now in me. Adal. Ah! The proconsul? Oct. None the less thy slave. Adal. Whate'er thy power, still Norma's will must be The law for us. Oct. (Aside.) Norma! That name recalls My errant duty. Shame on thee, Octavian! (To Adal.) Go! If thou'lt bar my looking on thy face Ever again, thou wilt have served me better Than if thou hadst snatched me from captivityâ Saved me from the terriblest strait that ever man Was thrown into by passion. There 's a peril, I tell thee, in thy looks, while thou dost linger, To which the thick of the battle, plague and tempest, Are innocent of danger. Adal. Fare thee well. (She moves away, turns, and he goes towards her.) Oct. That last look swept before it every scruple. (Taking her hand.) Promise thou 'lt meet me as I asked. Adal. I cannot. Oct. Promise, or I will hold thee with a grasp Inseverable as fate. Adal. Some one approaches. Oct. I care not. Promise. Adal. Let me go. I promise. (Enter Ambron [illeg.] in simple costume.) Amb. Release her, Roman! [Adalgisa breaks away, and exit. Thou art ignorant, 'T would seem, of Gallic manners. Oct. Teach me them. Amb. Never detain with an ungentle grasp A woman who would fly thee. Oct. In return I'll teach thee something of our Roman code: Never so misinterpret woman's coyness As to impute to any man, not quite A clown, unworthy rudeness. Amb. I beheld her Struggling to unloose thy hold. Oct. What if she struggled Half willing to be vanquished? Amb. Profanation Is in the thought. No vestal more renowned Than she for sanctity! Thy intimation Covers a hideous slander. Oct. Slander? Amb. Ay! Wilt have a plainer word. Oct. Little thou know'st To whom thou'rt speaking. Amb. Little know or care! Think'st thou I learn my hearer's quality Before I speak a truth? Oct. Remember, this Is now provincial Rome. Amb. A rare beginningâ To persecute a dedicated maiden With base advances. Oct. Base! Amb. I said it. Base! Be wiser for the future, or thou'lt find That Rome's dominion will be overturned As suddenly as set up. And so, take heed! (Going.) Oct. Stay! Since thy lecture is complete, hear mine. We have a way in Rome of teaching such As thou art, when the tongue is too unruly, A wholesome discipline with blowsâand so Conduct thyself accordingly. Amb. Indeed! And when a low-born fellow like myself Raises his voice, or fails to duck his head In thy high presence, thou wiltâ Oct. Have him whipped! (Ambron laughs in his face. Octavian puts his hand on his sword.) Amb. Nay, don't be frightened by a Gallic laugh. We'll have no bloodshed. 'T would profane the occasion. Oct. Insolent! When thou know'st who 'tis thou tauntestâ Amb. Wert thou the emperor, he who would insult The common soldier, or the common peasant, Is a common fool. Oct. (Draws.) Draw, villain! Let me see If thou canst thrust as well with steel as speech. Come! or I'll smite thee with the flat of my sword. Thou'rt a laggard with thy weapon. Amb. (Aside, and half drawing.) I'll not harm him. Oct. Come! Should I leave thee wounded on the ground, Tell those who come to aid thee, that Octavian, Proconsul, punished thee for disrespect. Amb. (Aside.) Octavian! Norma's husband! And already Falseâin intent at least. O, wretched woman! What wo is in thy future! Oct. (Aside.) So! The name Has stunned him. He shall fight, though. Amb. (Aside.) I could slay him Now with a will. (Half draws.) I'll do itârescue Norma From pangs in store through himâNo, Ambron, no! She loves him. That shall make each hair of his head Sacred, although he spurn me. To fly temptation, I must fly the encounter. (To Octavian.) I shall not fight thee. Oct. What if I call thee coward? Amb. Thou'lt have had Some cause. Oct. What if I smite thee? Amb. 'T will be a new sensation, and I cannot Foretell the effect. Oct. Gaul, thou hast angered me As no man ever dared, and now refusest To fight meâYet I will not call thee coward, For such I cannot hold thee; and I see It is not fear that sways thee. (Puts up his sword.) There! thy act Has been like water to my rage. We both Have said what should exasperate the other. Exchange forgiveness. (Offers his hand.) Amb. (Aside.) Generous, too, as brave! There's hope. (Takes Octavian's hand.) No longer as thy enemy, But as thy friend, Octavian, because Norma's, (Start notâI know it all!) let me appeal To what there is of goodness in thy nature, Faithfullyâ Oct. Hush! She comes; and not alone. (Enter hastily Norma and Adalgisa.) Nor. (To Adal.) In anger? Foolish girl! They're met in friendship. (She dismisses her. Exit Adalgisa.) My husband! Oct. Hush! Should some one overhear thee! Nor. But this is Ambron, who knows all. Oct. This Ambron? Sir, I can prize true nobleness. Your hand! (Aside to him.) And let the past be cancelled. Amb. (Aside to Oct.) And the future Be pledged to Norma wholly. Nor. 'T is the sight I most have longed forâAmbron and Octavian With hands in friendly clasp! Come, ye are missed, Both, from the pageant. Oct. Go! I'll follow thee. [Exit Norma. Precede me, noble Ambron. Go with Norma. (Exit Ambron. Octavian looks off in the direction of Adalgisa's departure. ReÃ«nter Ambron.) Amb. Nay, let us go together. Oct. (Giving his hand which Ambron takes.) Be it so! [Exeunt. END OF ACT III. ACT IV. Scene I. âExterior of the Proconsul's Palace. Steps leading to it. Enter Rudiger, disguised as a beggar. Rud. How long, ye awful deities, how long Must this breast hide th' impatience of its beatings Under these squalid rags, while here in triumph Your enemy and mine, the hated Roman. Resides in sumptuous state?âOr, is the Druid Indeed a thing of the past, and his religion, His ancient lore traditional (recorded Only in faithful memories)âis it now No longer the salt of the earth, the truth supreme, But a detested fable, never more To win belief from men? It cannot be! The gods who gave the truth will yet avenge it. To this rock have I clung though storms have beat Upon this aged head, and though I've been Abandoned solitary to their rage, And darkness has involved me,âhere I've clung, And here will cling forever, in the faith My fathers gave me, and which death itself Shall not have power to vanquish or to shake. (Enter Arnulf. Rudiger turns from him.) Arn. That formâthat gaitâI cannot be mistaken. Old man, why turn from me? Rud. I know you not. Arn. But I know youâth' Arch DruidâRudiger. Rud. And you? the renegade, Arnulf! Arn. Not so loud! That's the proconsul's palace. Like yourself Am I proscribed. We'll keep each other's secret. They thought to hold me prisoner at Romeâ But I escaped amid a popular riot Just as we entered the imperial city; And I am here to help you put an end To this fair state of things. And first, of Norma. Rud. Ah! but for her the Roman power in Gaul Could be laid low to-morrow. Arn. Not a week Returned, more have I done than all your Druids In their own cause. Rud. Explain. Arn. First learn that Norma Is the proconsul's wife. Rud. Norma! unfaithful To that paternal dedication which Pledged her a vestal priestess!âI'll proclaim it To all the peopleârouse their furyâsend them To burn and sack the Roman's palaceâthen Consign her to the penalty prescribed For such offenders. Arn. Wildâimpracticable! What care the people for your Druid laws? Norma has but to claim from all the gods (I beg their pardonâI forget their number) A special vision abrogating all Her virgin pledges, and commanding her To wed Octavian, and the fatuous people Will ratify the union with huzzas. Be this your secret for the present. Rud. Well. But should the power return, let her beware! What wouldst thou do? Arn. What I have done is this: Invoked the demon of domestic discord! Long since, this dolt, Octavian, was becrazed By the soft glances of a maid attendant Upon the temple's service, Adalgisa. Them, after interruption of his suit By her seclusion, have I brought together (How, when, and where, no matter) thro' one Bertha; And the old flame now threatens to break forth With added fury. Rud. But 't is sacrilege! Arn. (Aside.) The duper his own dupe! Sacrilege truly! (To Rud.) Pshaw! What of that, so we inveigle Norma To her own ruinârend the tie that binds her To the proud Romanâmake her rouse the people In your behalfâthen leave her to be dealt with (When all is won) after your gentle fashion? Rud. This must be thought of. You've gone deep, I see, Into the possibilities. Arn. I'll show Cause for reliance. On! We're interrupted. (Looking off.) Otho, the Roman knight, with an attendant, Post-haste most like from Rome! There must be news. (Exeunt Rudiger and Arnulf. Enter Otho and Marcus.) Otho. (To Marcus.) See that our horses are provided for, Then be within my summons at the palace. (Exit Marcus. Enter Servant from the palace.) Otho. Is the proconsul stirring? Servant. He approaches. (Exit Servant. Enter Octavian.) Oct. Otho! my friend! What could be more unlooked for Than to see you in Gaul? (Enter Arnulf, who listens a moment, then exit.) Otho. I bring the news Of your recall. Rome wants you nearer home. (Gives him a scroll.) This from the emperor! Oct. (After reading.) Recalled with honor. An intimation, too, of something higher!â Now shall I smile or frown at this discharge? It does not take effect till my successor Is on the spot. Otho. Him you may look for daily. Is it ill news? Dejected? Can it be Octavian, once the courted, the caressed By the high dames of Rome, I see content To bury in provincial privacy Endowments due to the metropolis? Oct. Jingle your gewgaws in the ears of boys. Have you forgotten that I'm married? Hush! 'Tis still a secret. Otho. (Laughing.) Ay, I had forgotten; Or rather counted on your constancy As on the west wind's blowing. Pardon me; Your spouse must be a paragon indeed To've kept you stable. But I've made you serious. Oct. O! speak of her with reverent admiration, The brave, the gentle, the magnanimous, The faithful Norma! Otho. There's a sequel to That rhapsody. Oct. There is. Before I met her, I had seen Adalgisa, and my heart Is constant to that vision. Otho. (Laughs.) Constancy Is then thy failing here! Thou art too constant! Oct. When state necessity induced this marriage, I struggled (and still struggle) to subdue All memory of that other; but of late The sight of her in all her loveliness, Revives the dangerous transport, and when you Told me of my recall, the coward thought Shot through my brain, now can I fly with her, Forsaking Norma. Otho. And does sheâdoes Norma Suspect your dereliction? Oct. No; the thought Would come to her as the tornado comes When you can see no cloud. Otho. A little rain, A flash or two perhaps, and all is over. Be not alarmed. I have myself inflicted Some such surprises in my day, and found A strange capacity of convalescence In women being so wounded. Oct. (Aside.) Ay, by you! Otho. Here is my counsel now: abandon both! No? Then select the younger and the prettierâ In short, the one you fancy. Oct. I am pulled By passion and by duty different ways. O! like a strong man take me in the arms Of a strong will, and carry me perforce The way of rightâfor tho' 'tis plain before me, My will is wavering, and my flesh is weak. Otho. Come then, it shall be Norma; for possession Gives her the prior claim. Oct. But Adalgisaâ When she finds him she trusted in, a traitorâ Otho. Well! you must be that either way. What's left? The women both are fair, and both in love. What if you take them both? Oct. You only sport With my distress. Otho. Pardon an old campaigner. Who never gave such trifles serious thought.â Looking off. Who is that stately woman in the veil, Pacing yon garden walk? Oct. 'Tis she! 'Tis Norma! Now, Otho, would you see the veriest coward, Look upon Rome's proconsul. Otho. (Going.) Look on me! Retreating panic-stricken from the danger And leaving the wounded in the enemy's hands. Oct. Go in, and order all things as becomes Octavian's guest. Otho. Looking off. She lifts her veil. Octavianâ I sayâI'd rather be where thunderbolts Are falling thick, than, having wronged, confront her. [Exit into the palace. Oct: What! shall this heart, that fluttered not to rush. On the Sicambrian phalanx, sink and cower Before a woman?âAh! it is not sheâ 'Tis not the gloom and lightning of those eyes That thus abashesâ'tis the sickened conscience Shuddering at wrongs which passion meditates. (Enter Norma.) Nor: (Approaching to caress him.) Octavian! Oct. Hold! not here in the public eye! Nor: The time has come when without fear we may Proclaim our union. Oct: O, not yet, not yet! Nor: This separation from thee for long hoursâ This seeing thee by stealth when I do see theeâ Is irksome and should end. Oct: And soon it shall. We'll talk of it tomorrow. Nor: Well, tomorrow. What troubles thee? Oct: Affairs of state. No more. Nor: Not so! I know the cause. Oct. Thou know'st the cause? Nor. Why this alarm if 'tis affairs of state? Oct. (Aside.) Knows she? Nor. Come, be an honest husbandâtell meâ Even though it be to my disquietâtell me! For 'twixt us, candor should be so complete That not a quickened heart-beat should be felt By one and not reported to the other. Oct. My heart beats placidly. Nor. (Putting forth her hand.) That let me test. How? Dost thou shrink? Oct. Not here! Nor. Why art thou troubled? Oct. Why ask me, if thou knowest? Nor. For I'd have it From thy own lips in full sincerity, Even though to spare me pain thou keep'st it back. But do not fear for that. The pain is overâ All that the news could give! Oct. (Aside.) What does she mean? Nor. Who was the stranger, on whose parting heels I came but now? Oct. An officer from Rome. Nor. What message brought he? Oct. Message? Nor. I will tell you: You are recalled: you fear the news will be A blow to Norma: therein lies your trouble. Were you so tender of my reckoned grief You dared not tell me this? Did you distrust My readiness to quit home, country, people, For thy dear sake? Ah! 'tis no sacrifice To love like mineârather a joy to show thee How prompt, how faithful, how uncalculating Its action is. Oct. (Aside.) So! she knows nothing more. (To Norma.) Think of the journey's dangers. Nor. Thou wilt meet them! Why should not I? In thy sweet company Dangers shall not affrightâhardships shall wear An ever smiling front. Should duty lead thee To rugged climes of everlasting snow. Or to those regions, courted by the sun. Where reptile life is rank, and beasts of prey Lurk in the torrid swamps, would I not go With thee, watch by thee, wert thou ill or wounded. And count it happiness, in every peril Befalling thee, to be a constant sharer? Indeed I would! Oct. (Aside.) On, on, and thou'lt prevail! (To her.) But there are ties detaining thee in Gaulâ Public and pious ties, forsaking which, Regret will sting. Nor. Regretâwhile thou art kind? Ties?âO! what ties can have the sanctity Of those the promise of a wife takes in, Binding her to that circle of attraction Which is her husband's sphere of love and duty? Was it with half a heart I wedded thee, Keeping the other for a round of thoughts And occupations, that to thee pertained not? No! The true wife must be her husband's wholly. And there's a magic in her fast affection, Exalts even homeliest drudgery to an act Of queenly momentâfinds a recompense, Richer than wealth could compass, in a smile! Establishes a palace of content In a pure heart, let outward circumstance Frown as it may, and makes her happiness O'erflow in loving and in being beloved! Ah! even the service of the gods grows irksome. Compared with thineâmy pray'rs all follow thee. If still I hold my station in the temple 'Tis but to meet thy wish; and my release From all that can abridge a wife's devotion, Will be a joyful freedom. Oct. (Aside.) She prevails. And makes my intent seem hateful. (To her.) We will go Together, Norma. With thee ever near I shall be strong. To-night I'll visit thee, And we'll decide upon an instant course Touching the proclamation of our marriage. Nor. Wilt thou come early? My expecting moments Lag wearily, and bring a troop of fancies, That make my heart their sport, presenting thee In all varieties of danger, till, Sick of their conjurations, I rush forth Into the night to find thee. Oct. Thou shalt be Requited in the future. Nor. The requital Comes when we meet. Remember! Oct. I'll not fail. [Exit Norma So shall it be! And I will shun, as I would mortal danger, Another interview with Adalgisa. Why not proclaim at once my marriage? That Will terminate temptation! (Enter Arnulf and Adalgisa.) Arn. There you see him, Nursing his grief, torn by despairing thoughts. He flies from Gaulâabandons every hopeâ Because of thy rejectionâthat he may, In distant scenes, o'ercome his unrequited, His fatal passion. He has planned to go, Taking no leave, shunning the sight of thee. O! give him, for content in future years, One parting word, if not of love, of kindness. [Exit Adal. Yes, prudence shall not bar that poor return. Oct. Ha! Adalgisa! Now the gods bear witness, Thee, of all human objects I would shun! Yet here thou com'st with thy imploring eyes And gaze of innocent wonder, to undo me And fool to ruin. Hence! thou sorcery! hence! Or I shall grow to hate thee.âNay, forgive me; But, go! in mercy, leave me! Let me not Hear those soft tones, or see that face again. Remorse and shame, despair and death are in them! (Exit Adalgisa.) Gone! (Calls.) Adalgisa! (She reÃ«nters.) Dost thou leave in anger? Adal. Anger? O, no! Obeying, I believed 'T was thy heart's wisdom spakeâand so, 't was well That we should part forever, and in silence. Oct. Forever? Adal. Thou wilt leave us. Oct. Thou didst know it, And yet couldst part so calmly? Adal. Ay; so calmly. 'T is the calm grief abideth. Oct. Thou wilt grieve? Adal. 'T is probable. Oct. O! perfect in thy art! Now dost thou know, that hadst thou come with signs Of anguish, hair dishevelled, streaming eyes, Speech-breaking sobs and accents of upbraiding, I had been disenchantedâthou hadst lost me! And so thou play'st the calm and frigid maid, Kindlest my fire with ice: but thou shalt failâ I'm not the dupe thou look'st for. Adal. Peace be with thee! Farewell! (Going.) Oct. Stay! Whither goest thou? Adal. To the templeâ Whence I should ne'er have wandered. Oct. To the temple! With all the lustre of thy youth about thee To sink into its gloom!â'T is Fate waylays me, And in his fierce and unrelenting grasp Bears me along! Why wrestle with him further Since I at last must yield? Adal. My lord, farewell! Oct. Thou shalt not leave me. Thou shalt go with me To Romeâthere be my honored wife. Adal. To Rome? Oct. Ay! Thither I return tomorrowânowâ Soon as my equipage is ready! Come! Thou shalt be my companion. We will make The journey short; and I will watch thy litter As parent eagles do their nest. Delay Is fraught with danger. Come! Thou dost refuse? Dost calculate? Thou lov'st me not! Adal. Too well! Or I were not so tempted.âBut the vow That binds me to the templeâ Oct. Wert thou bound By chains of tested steel, love's flame should melt them! And still thou waverest? Adal. Norma can release me. Oct. Norma! Fly rather to the end of the earth Than seek for such release. Adal. Do what thou wilt! I'll go with thee. Oct. 'T is bravely said. Prepare! An hour hence, meet me in yon garden walk Ready for flight. A host of things press on me, Claiming despatch. The reasons for this speed Are vital. Trust me for them. Be discreet, [Exit Adalgisa 'T is the irrevocable die! Now, Norma, One word to keep thee quietâthen for Rome! [Exit (ReÃ«nter Adalgisa.) Adal. My lord Octavian! Gone? He thought of Norma As of a harsh, unsympathizing mistress. That is she not. My hope is, she'll absolve me From my religious vows. 'T were to defy The gods, and bring perhaps their persecution On me and him, should I forsake their service In an unsanctioned haste.âNorma shall have My confidenceâand speed me with her blessing! [Exit SCENE II. An apartment in Norma's house. Chairs placed for two. Enter Norma and Bertha. Nor. Now, girl, thy story. (Sits.) Why this mystery? Ber. Are we not overheard? Nor. That risk be mine! Ber. No tale-bearer am I; but, when a maid, Pledged to the temple's service, strays so far From duty as to listen to a man Protesting love, 'tis time for me to speakâ That you'll allow. Nor. Well. Ber. Adalgisa, ladyâ Nor. What of her? Ber. She's the culprit. She's in love. Nor. Is't true? Poor thing! Ber. (Aside.) Poor thing? And is that all? Won't she be hung, or burnt, or drowned in a sack? Poor thing! I'll fall in love myself to-morrow. I've had temptationsâquite enough of themâ As well as other folksâI'm no more marble Nor snow than theyâbut honest flesh and blood. Poor thing indeed! Nor. What art thou muttering, girl? Ber. Only a pray'r that you'll be merciful To Adalgisa. Must she die? Nor. The day Is gone when such offence could be so punished. Under the Druid rule it might have been. Ber. But she'll be scourged? Nor. When wert thou privileged To question my intents; and how art thou Concerned to know her punishment? Ber. (Aside.) I would know If 't will be such as I could bear. Nor. Her fault Is doubled by concealment. Canst thou tell me What man has dared address her? Ber. That is what Will most amaze you, seeing that Adalgisa Is no way notable for sense or beauty, But quite inferior in both to many Of her associates. Then she has no styleâ NoâI cannot describe itâloftiness Of manner, which we some have. Nor. Cease thy prating. Tell me her lover's name. Ber. You'll beâ (Enter Adalgisa.) Nor. But here She comes to answer for herself. (To Bertha.) Begone. Ber. (Aside.) âPoor thing!â Mayhap, I'll be a poor thing, too! [Exit Nor. (Aside.) She's mute with apprehension. How can I Rebuke her, needing as I do myself An equal exculpation? (To her.) Adalgisa, Draw nearâbe seatedâI have heard thy story. (Adal. sits.) Adal. And have no anger for meâno reproaches? But howâbut whenâwhat have you heard? Nor. That thou Hast dared to hold discourse with one who urges A lover's suit. Adal. O! let me tell you all. He has my word to fly with him this day. Nor. Imprudent! And thou'st venturedâ Adal. (Kneels.) Could you know With what renewals of thick-coming tears, What vigils, supplications, I have striven To root from my heart the passion driving me To this conclusion, you'd be pitiful, Perchance would pardon. Nor. (Aside.) So did I contendâ So yield! I almost feel the same wild throbs That then made tumult here. I almost see Him at my feet again, and hear his voiceâ His music-shaming voiceâthat pleaded so That I relented and surrendered allâ A cheap exchange for love. Adal. Dismiss me not Unpardoned, unreleased. Nor. Have all thy wish. I pardon; I release thee with this kiss Upon thy brow from all there is of bondage In thy religious state. Adal. (Rises.) O! joyful freedom! Without a crime now can I love and be Beloved. O! Norma, you so pure, so true, In your self-abnegation, your adhesion To vestal sanctity, say, how can you Have such quick sympathy with one whose weakness Could not withstand her first, her only trial? Nor. Norma claims no preÃ«minent exemption From human frailty, girl; the strongest of us May one day find that her security Is based on air. But come, thou hast not told me Aught of thy lover. Adal. 'T was no outside bravery That won me first, but words that found their way Straight to the heartâuplifting it and showing Affinity with all in thought and deed That we can best admire in our best moods. Nor. (Aside.) Such was the path my own affections followed. (To her.) Who spake such words? Adal. No countryman. Nor. A Roman? (Enter Octavian.) Adal. Behold him here! Nor. (Rising.) Octavian! Oct. (Aside.) All is ruined! Nor. Girl! Do thy wits wander? He thy lover? He? Thou must be blinded. Look again. (Laughs.) Octavian, What a mistake! Adal. 'T is he! no other, Norma. Nor. Idiot! heâhe thy lover? Wilt thou mock me? Octavian, undeceive her with thy voice. Adal. It is the truth. Nor. The truth? Audacious wanton! Never was lie blacker begot in hell. Hear him with but a word transfix it such, And make thy crazy freak matter for scorn. Speak it, Octavian! Oct. Leave us, Adalgisa. (She is going.) Nor. Stay, girl! Oct. I charge thee, go! Nor. And I, remain! Oct. Wilt thou obey? Adal. Not while this mystery Involves meâfrights my reasonâmenaces I know not what of dreadful. Ah! what is it? Nor. Come hither: is this he who has played thy lover And planned to fly with thee this very day? Adal. As I do hope for mercy, he it is! Nor. O, Adalgisa! (Covers her face with her hands.) Adal. Norma, do not weep. Nor. O, would that I could weep! Adal. What great distress Has come to thee I know not, but I share it. Nor. Thou dost! The blow is double, smiting both. In that man see my husband! Adal. Ah! (Retires and sits.) Nor. To me bound By all that law could lend of sanctityâ By all of multiplied and tender bonds Honor could feel and cherish. I so loved him I would have plucked my heart out to uphold him In health and safetyâwould have looked on death As a slight thing, encountered in his service. And now. ... O! fool, fool, fool! what thou hast spurned Was such a treasure as a god might roam On earth long years to winâwas such a sum Of deep, devoted, deifying love As would have crowned with its felicity Thy life, and shed celestial radiance on it. Now, like a star hurled from its sphere and lost In utter gloom, 'tis goneâgoneâgone! O, day Of anguish insupportable! O, hour To which none darker can succeed, tho' death Come black with every horror! Oct. Hear me, Norma. Nor. Ay, I have waited long. I'm all attention. Oct. I would have spared thee this abrupt disclosureâ Would have untied with gentle, cautious hand, The knot to thee so sacred. Nor. To me sacred? Only to me? Well: what wouldst thou have done? Oct. I would have waited till time's gradual power Had weaned thee from meâone by one unclasped Most tenderly the tendrils of thy loveâ Ere thou hadst known what this unheeding maid Has rashly uttered. Nor. For thy kind intents All gratitude.âO, miscreant! Could such words Issue from any heart that ever loved! âTime's gradual power!â âWeaned!â âTendrils!â Think you loveâ (Love! the immortal, amaranthine flower!) Is but a creeping ivy which the winter May loosen from one tree, the spring re-fasten On to another?âBut I interrupt you. Oct. Thou know'st the worstâand all that I would say Is to assuageâconsole. Nor. Console! O, mockery! Oct. One circumstance, if 'twill not justify, At least may serve me in extennuation. Arnulf spake truly: when I came to woo thee 'Twas in my country's service; and my marriage, Ordained by state necessity, was binding Only while that might last. So do not blame Me, but the system by which Rome would win Dominion here in Gaul. Nor. I live to hear it! Dupe that I was! self-seeking, wretched dupe! Myself abandoned, and my country sold To my betrayer!âAll your honeyed words Were then a lieâa trapâto ruin me And to enslave my people. You could play The matchless hypocrite in what's most holy To compass my perdition!âBut, your pardon! Rome's the offenderâRome! O! how convenient, when a man concurs In a foul wrong, to spread the shame of it over An unaccountable, uncertain mass, A stateâa public bodyâas if he Could thereby make his individual share Attenuate past the weighing! I deny Thy pleaâ'tis falseâignobleâhe but sins In magnified proportion, who would help A nation in its crime!â(Her ring suddenly attracts her notice.) That ringâlook on itâ And recollect the words with which you gave it. O! hollow, hollow, hollow! Take it back. (Takes off ring and offers it to Octavian, who receives it.) Oct. Before I met thee, I had met and loved (As she'll attest) this maiden. (Adal. rises.) How I strove to Displace her shrined image with thine own, Only my heart can know. In vain I strove; And when I found that in her breast was kindled An answering flame, mine swept that way to join it, And both became as one. Adal. (To Norma.) Ah! do not weep. Nor. Who weeps? Give me thy hand. (She leads Adalgisa to Octavian.) Take her, my lord. But, if ye prize each other's life, begone At onceâwithout a pauseâputting such speed Into your flight that the celerity Of vengeance shall be slack. I'm almost calm Now; but, another moment, such a frenzy May come to unpoise me, 'twill be dangerous To abide its wildness. Go! without a word! Oct. Now thou'rt thy noble self; now thou art Norma! Fear not but thy control in Gaul's affairs Shall still be paramount; that thou shalt keep Her freedom unimpaired, her welfare ever The first concern. The friend of my successor, Lucilius Lollius, I will so commend To him thy worth, no other counsellor Shall be so heeded. He is young, unmarried, Noble, discreet: perhaps, a happier tie Than that we sunder now, may consecrate In a brief while your friendship. Nor. Execration Upon thee for that thought! What! Would'st transfer me like a common wanton From one to the other? Thou hadst seemed to reach The utmost height of all potential wrongsâ But there was one, conception could not scaleâ Inhuman, gross, o'ertopping all the restâ And thou hast added that! Beware! Remember My blood is half barbarian, and despair Makes doubly strong. Go! I abjure compunction. This heart, so late the paradise of love, Is now a desolation for the Furies, And they are here. Fly ye! Fly both, before Their sport begins! Oct. Time shall abate thy grief And show me as thy friend, do what thou wilt. Come, Adalgisa! All is ready. Adal. Back, Roman! Oct. Delay not. Solitude shall bring Composure to her soul. Nor. Thee I blame not, Poor child. Farewell! Be happy. Adal. And could Norma Suppose, but for a moment, I could be The recreant wretch to leave her in her sorrowâ Leave her for himâher husbandâher betrayer! Those high and holy lessons that she gave me From childhood up, by precept and example, In every nobleness, in every virtue,â Thinks she they were so fruitless, I can stoop To such a partnership in wrong and shame As he would take me toâbe happy in it! Nor. Thou'rt my own pupil! Oct. Thy constraining presence Drives her to this. I fear not for the issue When she is free. Adal. There's such a separation Betwixt us twain, that neither gods nor men Can close it up. You think me meek and yielding, And so I am, except where conscience bars,â Then, not the firmament less moveable By human hand! Be undeceived in that. Oct. Women! ye drive me to the inmost trench. I'm still proconsul! Ye shall find it. I Have tried forbearance; if ye spurn it, there's Another way, and that my purpose takes Rather than fail. The maiden goes with me To Rome. Be sure of that. I'll hear no more Of your hysterical ravings. My resolve Is fixed. Prepare to see its execution. [Exit Nor. What wilt thou do? Adal. Die, Norma! Have I not This steel, to baffle outrage? Nor. Hapless maid! Adal. What are my griefs to thine? what to thy wrongs? Nor. O! for some way to save thee! to defeat His violent purpose. War and havoc! welcome, If ye'll do that! Methinks with this right hand I now could smite him to the earth. Alas! My own weak confidence has here undone me,â Transferred to him my powerâdisbanded all Our Gallic men of battleâdriven to caves The Druid foes of Romeâreposed in him The means to enforce his threat! (Enter Arnulf disguised.) Arn. There's yet a way To foil him. Nor. Who art thou? Arn. Rome's enemy. Nor. My friend, then! In aught else be spy or traitor,â Deliver us from the proconsul's power, Thou'rt my good genius! Arn. Soon his guards will be Around this house to cut off your retreat. Fly instantly. I'll lead you where the name Of Norma is a spell to rouse and rally Thousands. In his security through thee The Roman has sent home the better part Of his late army. Nor. True! Arn. Thou'lt have at once A force about thee, equal to resist, If not o'erwhelm him. Nor. Hah! Through fire and flood I'll follow thee. Lead on! Come, girl! Thy hand! 'Tis firm. Adal. Not firmer than my will. Nor. Lead on! [Exit Arnulf Not every hope is gone! One's left! It beckons From yonder cloud of blood, and smiles revenge! [Exeunt END OF ACT IV. ACT V. Scene I. âThe outskirts of a wood. Enter Otho wounded, and Marcus, meeting. Otho. Give me good news, or none. Mar. Then I'll be silent. Otho. Nay, man; let's have the worst. Mar. The day is lost. Otho. And many days to come! Where's the proconsul? Mar. Still trying the impossible,âto rally Our routed troops. His prodigies of valor, Example, voice, are all in vain. What folly When we're outnumbered ten to one! You're wounded. Otho. Scratched a little. Mar. Shall I not aid you? Otho. No. A little rest will serve. (Sits.) Escape while yet You may. Stay not for me. 'Tis my command. Mar. Unlucky day for Rome. [Exit Otho. Was ever man Precipitated from prosperity Into perdition, that a woman was not The mainspring of the mischief? HelenâHector! AntonyâCleopatra! Alwaysâalways, It takes a woman, thoroughly to undo us. Here was Octavian throned on fortune's summit! He offends a womanâwounds her prideâand lo! The summit is reversedâand he and all Rome's dearly purchased power in Gaul are pitched Into confusion! ... Here he comes! Chagrin And desperation, writ in every feature! (Enter with drawn sword, Octavian.) Oct. An utter rout! Not even my body-guard Saved from dispersion! What a tale will this be To tell in Rome! With every circumstanceâ Norma's desertionâAdalgisaâO! Can I endure the infamy? A province Lost through my love-sick giddiness! An army Sacrificed to prevent a girl's escape! O! 'twill sound well. How like a froward boy, Who doats upon his bane, and will possess it At every hazard, have I borne myself. I'll not survive my shame. (Voices.) Ha! Voices? This Shall put an end to a dishonored life, And make Gaul's triumph less. Death! awful Power! Be gracious, as self-doomed, self-blasted, thus I rush into thy darkness! (Kneels and puts sword to his breast.) Otho. (Rising and coming forward.) Stop a moment! Before you try that, let us hold a council Of war about it. Oct. (Rising.) Otho! Otho. You shall dine Better than on cold steel. Oct. So well on that I shall not crave another dinner. Otho. Death Keeps a poor table. Oct. Nay, the best. Your only Magnificent voluptuary he! Wealth, beauty, grandeurâall are his purveyors Kings and proconsuls cater for him only. To-day the flower and splendor of my army Are swept off in his forage. Lifeâwhat is it? Death's scullion! Otho. Yet to seek him uninvited May be to lose his hospitality.â Give up thy coward purpose. Oct. Coward! Otho. Ay! To fly from life at the first frown of fortune! Oct. Wert thou not wounded, I would smite thee now That thou mightst slay me. Otho. Slay thee? Scold thee rather! Cheer thee, man, cheer thee! Better times shall come. Oct. 'Tis not reverse of fortune, Othoânot This sudden outbreak and this overthrowâ Crushes all hope and makes life hideous. I Could bear calamity, smile on disaster, But that my own thrice execrable folly Has brought them on my country! Otho. Live, and time Shall help thee to repair the mischief.âHark! Voicesâand of the enemy!âThis way! Oct. 'Twill cost them something ere they capture usâ Something in blood. Otho. Be wary. Small our chance! [Exeunt (Enter Gontran and Rudiger, with Soldiers.) Gont. (To soldiers.) Go, scour the wood: some officers of rank, It may be, lurk there yet. Secure all such Alive, if possible. [Exeunt Soldiers Was ever rout More sudden and complete! Rud. Our study now Must be to hold what we have gained, nor let The cheapness of the purchase mitigate Our care to keep. This is a Druid triumph. Gont. That's doubtful. But for Norma's fiery words, Her influence on the people, we had hardly So quickly raised an army. Rud. But the Druids Flocked foremost to her standard, seeing that 'Twas against Rome she raised it; and the Druids Now must be reinstatedâlifted to Their old predominance in Gaul. If Norma Refuse to aid in thisâ Gont. If?â Rud. She must die! Gont. Could she not sooner give thyself to death? No questions would be asked then. But for herâ Who dare arrest her? I? Not I! My men? Not one of them! Rud. You overestimate The present bound of her authority. Gontran, we have a party, and a large one, Ready to throw the yoke off. Gont. 'Tis because She lays no yoke, her sway is what it is. I've heard before these intimations, but They never came to aught. Rud. We have a charge Against her now will crush her. She has broken Her vestal vowâis married. Gont. Ha! Rud. And, Gontran, Her fall shall be thy rise. Thou shalt be chief, Civil and military, over Gaul. I do not grasp at phantoms: 'tis assured, If thou'lt but lend us, at the needful time, Thy countenance and aid. Gont. What you propose Is sudden. I'll consider. Rud. And who, think you, Is implicated with the priestess? (A clashing of swords without.) Gont. Hark! A skirmish! This way came the sounds! Halloo! [Exeunt SCENE II. A Druidical temple and altar. A brazen shield for sounding an alarm hung on one side. Enter Norma, wearing an oaken chaplet. Nor. And all the while he loved another! All The while his soul dwelt on another's image! Each passionate word he spoke was prompted by Another's charmsâframed for another's ear! Abhorred dissembler! if I pardon thee May my keen sense of wrong expire, and outrage Familiar grown be rendered and received But as my due! And 't was his transient glance At Adalgisa could so fortify His heart against meâmake desertion easyâ Extenuate falsehood. Her smooth face has been The lure of my perdition! But for her I still might be a wifeâhe might be loyal! (Enter Adalgisa.) You trespass on my privacy. Away!â Nay, do not mind me. Stay! Forgive my harshness, You too have suffered. 'T was in ignorance You crossed me here. (Her heart.) Adal. Yet, Norma, like a culprit I feel, approaching thee. O! may I not Strive some way to undo the wrong which I Unwittingly have aided? I will see himâ Fall at his feetâadmonishâlead him back To love and duty!â Nor. No! too late! too late! As well restore to the crushed flower its bloom! Or make the shattered column whole again. No more, O! never more, can be restored The glory vanished. Adal. Nay, despair not. I Will so plead to him for theeâ Nor. Plead for me? To him? To him? Leave me! [Exit Adalgisa Plead for me! She! Tease him to take me back! Entreat, and be Rejectedâlaughed at! O! not yetânot yet Am I so abject grown that I would sue For such return of love as was not given From its own free, unprompted overflow. The love that importunity could win Were bought for me too dearly! ... Sue to him! Let him beware lest the time swiftly come When he must sue to me for his base life! And shall he have it? Ye dark Powers, who know Our thoughts before they're utteredâwho are nigh Invisible but vigilant to aid The vengeful purpose, gird me with your strength, And check each throb of pity, filling me With rancor not my own, to launch upon him A traitor's death. (Enter Egbert.) The news? How leans the battle? Egb. To victory! The Roman is defeated! His army put to flight, and utterly Disbanded. Nor. The proconsulâ? Egb. No one yet Knows of his fate. Nor. Our triumph were imperfect Should he escape. Let search be made for him On every side. Be speedy. [Exit Egbert Now, Octavian, Now hast thou found that she, upon whose heart Thou thought'st to trample with thy armÃ«d heel, In safety, had, with sense to feel her wrong, The power to punish. Little didst thou dream Of this. She's but a woman (thou didst reckon)â A burst of tearsâsome words of fierce upbraidingâ And there 't will end; and I shall go my way Pleasantly with my paramour, and laugh Among my peers in Rome at Norma's love And my abandonment.âPerfidious wretch! Now shalt thou learn what thou hast lost in Normaâ Shalt learn to prizeâif not her loveâher power. (Enter Egbert.) Well? Egb. The proconsulâhe is captured. Nor. Hang him On the first tree! Egb. But he fought hard! It was not Till they had stunned him with a battle axe, Aimed from behind and battering his helmet, That they could take him. Nor. (With changed emotion.) Is he wounded? Egb. Slightly. When he came to, he grasped a sword and strove To slay himself. Nor. To ... slay himself? Egb. But we Prevented that, and have him now secured. Nor. Bring him before me. [Exit Egbert Wounded? Seeking death? Norma! What's this? Dost tremble? Where's the firmness That now should brace thee to an awful justice? Let him see no relenting. Think upon Thy wrongsâhis perfidyâand death shall seem A penalty too light. Down, thoughts of ruth! He comes. I know his step too wellâtoo well! (Enter Egbert with Octavian, pinioned.) (Aside.) Pinioned! (To Egbert.) Release him. Egb. Norma, I'm forbidden To do that. Nor. Is it done? Egb. To me thy word Is still supreme. I do it. (Releases Octavian.) Nor. Leave us now. [Exit Egbert. Are you much injured? Oct. Nay, not consciously. Methinks my sense is dead to outward pain. Nor. And can your inward pain, think you, compare With what I have enduredâyou have inflicted? But now, you're in my power. Oct. Norma, I know it; And so (though all unworthy) ask one graceâ A swift release from life! No word of thine Can aggravate remorse, or make me look With a more poignant loathing on myself. I've wronged thee to that pitch, thy mercy would Be an ignoble weakness! 't is my death Alone can right thee. Nor. O, Octavian! How did I trust thee! Thy betrayal robs me Not of a husband merely, but of faith In human goodnessâplants within my heart A wretched incredulity for that Eager belief in virtue, which could plume Immortal hopes. Oct. Lend me thy dagger, Norma, And let me spare thee one affliction more (For such it will be, if not now, hereafter!) The order for my death. Nor. I've still the power To save and free thee. Oct. But thou durst not use it. Nor. I dare and will, on one condition. Oct. What? Nor. Give me thy oath that thou'lt henceforth forever Abandon all pursuit of Adalgisa! Thus shalt thou have thy lifeâthy liberty! Oct. The first I ask not, and the last I gain In losing that. Nor. Swear, swear! Time flies. Oct. I cannot! Nor. Thou wilt not give her up? Oct. To save life? No! Nor. Beware! My passion will not be outdone By thine. Her too I have within my power. Oct. Thou wouldst not harm her? Nor. Thou canst speak and save her. Oct. She's guiltless. Nor. Guiltless? Ask our Druid fathers Who (thanks to thee!) now lift their heads again, If she, a priestess, who'd have fled with thee, Is guiltless? Dost thou know the punishment They have for such offenders? I will tell thee: Death at the stake, by fire! Oct. Most horrible! Thou'lt not denounce her for a crime which thou Art guilty of? Nor. Why not? Is death to me A terror, think'st thou? Thou shalt live to taste The sweetness of that cup which thou couldst send In such a generous measure to my lips. (Going.) Oct. Norma! Nor. Back! Oct. Spare her! Mercy, I implore thee, Mercy for her! The rack, the flame for me! Torture my fleshâ Nor. What's torture of the flesh To that appalling torture of the spirit Which thou hast made me feel? (Smites the shield furiously.) Oct. Not for my life, Norma, but hersâI yieldâI take thy oath. Nor. Thou dost? This also promise: 'gainst thy own life thou Wilt lift no hand. Oct. That's harderâbut I promise. Nor. And spite of thy disloyalty to me I trust thee. Thou shalt liveâshalt have thy freedom. Oct. And Adalgisa? Nor. I would yield myself Up to their flames, sooner than harm a hair Of her dear head. Oct. (Kneels.) More than thy threats, thy mercy Forces me to my knees and makes the vileness Of all my wrongs too glaring. O, forgive! Nor. Never! Up, up! The Druids are at hand. (Octavian risesâNorma kneels at the altar. Music. Enter Rudiger, with Druids, Gontran with Soldiers, Arnulf, priestesses, &amp;c.) Rudiger. (To Arnulf.) Suspects she aught? Arnulf. I've watched her narrowly. But can learn nothing. Rudiger. (To Gontran.) Can we trust the army? Gont. Those near around us are picked menâthe mass I cannot answer for. Arn. We need not fear them. When all is carried, they will be the first To throw their caps up for you. In delay Our danger lies. Rud. Enough! (To Norma.) Your summons, Norma, Has here convoked us, and we wait your word. Nor. (Rising and coming forward.) This victory, Gauls, gained with such petty loss On our sideâproves it not, the gods have guided (Better than we could plan) our destiny? Who would have thought, the step so many deemed Rome's triumph and Gaul's overthrow, should end In this day's work? Thus do the Eternal Powers Make our own blindness and hostility Serve their designsâlodging in what seems evil To us our highest good. Has the event Justified all I did? Egb. Ay, Norma! Nor. Then learn my present actâand to the gods Confide the consequences. I release Herewith our prisoner, the proconsul. Rud., Gont., Arn. No! It must not be! Nor. Not be? Who dares dispute My sovereign will? Rud. I dare, and many dare Dispute it. He must die! Nor. Must die? A prisoner Of war must die? be murdered in cold blood? Rome can retaliateâhave ye thought of that? Rud. 'T is not as prisoner of war we doom him: He has committed sacrilege! has wedded A priestess of the templeâand for thatâ Say, soldiers, what should be his sentence? Soldiers. Death! Rud. What hers, the partner of his crime? Soldiers. Death! Death! Arnulf. Her name? Rud. Behold herâNorma! All. Norma! Rud. Ay! Will she deny it? Nor. She denies all right In youâor youâor any man to question Her supreme pleasure. She has violated No oathâno sacrilege committedâand She fears not but the gods will shield their own To your confusion. Rud. We will hear no more. Nor. Am I hemmed in by foes? What! Soldiers! Men Of Gaul! By all deserted? Not one faithful? Notâ Rud. We forbid all manner of appeal From the decree. No more!âYour chaplet, Norma! Nor. (Taking it off.) Not to thy hands I yield itâbut to earth Who gave it me. (Throws it to the ground.) Oct. Druids, on me let fall Your heaviest vengeance! But, as ye are menâ Not wolvesâor as ye would escape the swift And certain punishment which Rome shall sendâ Spare her, a woman. Rud. Threats and pleas avail not. Nothing can change your doom. Ye die together. And that forthwith. Prepare there! (Looking off. Nor. Then, Octavian, The power to keep my pledge to save and free thee Is gone. Oct. Regard not that. For theeâfor thee OnlyâI grieve! O! in this solemn hour Grant me thy pardonâI alone have brought This wo and death upon thee! Nor. I forgive theeâ And count it happiness with thee to die. Oct. Those words have quite unmanned meâthey have shown me The vastness of that love, which, like a wild Insensate prodigal, I forfeited. O, Norma! The frenzy that could lead me to forsake thee Was but the senses passionânow I know. From death's own touchstone, that my soul's true love Is my own wife. Nor. My husband! All's forgiven! Oct. Wilt thou again receive it? (Offers her a ring.) Nor. Joyfully! (Puts on ring.) O! what a cloud is lifted! what a flood Of bliss comes pouring on my heartârestoring All that was lost, in fuller, richer measure! I tread on airâI am again a brideâ A happier one that ever! Dear Octavian! (Arnulf approaches with four Soldiers.) Arn. It grieveth me to interrupt this dalliance. But see! the flames are lightedâand we wait. Ye overlook me. Is this courteous, when Ye owe me your acquaintance? Nor. There is mercy In thy revenge. Thou'st given us this last Dear privilegeâto die together! Arn. Come, then! Your time is ended. (Sound of a trumpet without.) Rud. Hold! Who dares invade Our sacred precincts with untimely music? (Enter ?, Soldiers and then Ambron.) All. Ambron! Amb. A greeting to you all. Norma! What's this? What rites are these? Rud. Approach her not, O Ambron! Of sacrilege convicted, in her union With the proconsul, both are here condemned To die the death. Amb. Indeed! That's somewhat sudden. Rud. Hadst thou been with us sooner, thou hadst shared In this day's triumph over the proconsul. Amb. And ye did miss, regret me? 'Tis a pity That I was absent. Well: why do ye pause? Gont. On with the prisoners! (A pause.) Amb. Now this is strange! Will no man stir to do his captain's bidding? Heard ye? He said, On with the prisoners! Well; Will none obey? All motionless! What means it? (To Rudiger.) Druid, explain! Rud. Ambron, respect for thee Withholds them till thy voice has seconded The order. Now, good Ambron, noble Ambron, The pride of Gaulâfit wielder of the sword Of Brennusâthou wilt acquiesceâwilt punish This sacrilegious pair!âthink of it, Ambron: She must needs wed a Romanâwas there no one, If recreant she must be, more worthy of Her choice among her valiant countrymen? Thou wilt stand by us here, good Ambronâwilt Move not a finger to avert the sentence The army has confirmed! Amb. The army, truly! Your squad of traitors ye do call an army! Let oneâor allâcome forward if they dare T' oppose my will in this. I know the armyâ Have told them all ye charge 'gainst Normaâand They are as true to follow us as is The thunder-clap the lightningâto unite With us to sweep from the polluted earth The Druids and their worship. Hear ye that? Back to your caves! Your triumph endeth here. Norma, thou'rt free! Octavian, thou art free! Arnulf. (Aside.) Balked in my patient hate, when all seemed won? The brand, I owe to Norma, on this fleshâ Ay, on this heartâshall it be cancelled never? (To Norma.) Norma! a word with thee; a single word! This for thee, Norma! (Tries to stab Norma, but stabs Octavian, who has warded off the blow. Ambron, with his sword, wounds Arnulf, who is then seized by two of Ambron's men. Octavian is supported by Norma.) Ambron, curses on Thy fortune that could bring thee here to save Her thy heart doats on! Could I reach thee, Iâ Amb. Away with him! Away! (Arnulf is carried out.) Nor. Octavian! husband. In saving me, thou'rt wounded! Oct. Welcome wound! Nor. Droop notâ'tis slightâindeed 'tis slight. Oct. No, dearest; The justice of the gods was in the blow, And it went home. Norma, forgive thy husbandâ Forget his guiltâandâif thou canstâimagine Some touch of goodness in himâand be sure He blessed theeâdyingâby this token. (Kisses her.) Nor. Dying! Oct. Ambron, farewell! Protect her still. Where, Normaâ Where art thou? Do not leave me. Nor. Leave thee? Never! Oct. So! Keep thy hand upon my heartâand smile Forgiveness on meâtill I die. Farewell! (Dies.) Nor. Octavian! My beloved! One word! Dead? Dead? (Falls on the body.) Curtain Falls. END OF THE TRAGEDY.</field>
