      <field name="fulltext">Count Julian, Or The Virgin of the First Fond Love. A Tragedy, In Five Acts By T. H. Chivers, M.D. Dramatis Personae Men Count Julian, betrothed to Ianthe. Lamorah, the Mico, or High Priest, of the Seminoles. Ostinee, Lamorah's son. Ensenore, a Seminolean Warrior, called the Thunderbolt of War. Esnah, a Seminolean Warrior, called the Captain of the Sons of Night. Tehoah, a Seminolean Warrior, called the Captain of the Brave. Fifty Warriors who celebrate the Banqueting of Souls. Women Ianthe, the Virgin of the First Fond Love (also called Celuta), Endea, an orphan, the adopted daughter of Lamorah. Canondah, the wife of Lamorah. The Ten Fair Virgins of the Isle of Founts. Act 1. Scene 1. The Margin of the Lake between the Oakmulgee and Flint was from which the river St. Mary has its source, near which a boat is lying on the water. Lamorah is discovered sitting on the ground close by underneath an Oak. Enter Count Julian, bearing his hoop, draped in the garments of Yanassa, Lamorah's son, whom he supposes to be dead, attended by Lamorah. Count Julian Beneath an aged Oak, whose hundred arms are lifted up, as in mute prayer, to God, Silvered with many hundred years, whose locks Of Argent moss hang waving to the groundâ Alone on the silver sand, the last of all His Tribe, Lamorah leans alone! But now Upon his back the well-stored quiver hangs. His great Herculean form is clad with skins Fantastically fringed with down of Swans, And ornamented with the rarest beads. His feet are sandaled with red Moccassins; His Wampun-belt is fastened round his waist; An Eagle-plume, cresting his head, now waves Aloft, swayed by the odorous winds which come Laden with perfume from the Isle of Flowersâ An emblem of his mighty heart now free. Close to his ear in his right hand, he holds A rose-lipped shell which sings mysterious songs, And soothes his weary soul to peace; for in Its soft Aeolian cadences it seems The soul of his Yanassa, his dead son, Come back to lead him to the Land of Souls. Rapt with the sense of its sweet melody, He has forgotten all things in the world, Remembering nothing but his own deep joy, Born of his Memory of the Olden Time, In days gone by when he was in his prime, And Young Yanassa was his son on earth. Lamorah rises from his seat, approaches Count Julian, and gives him his hand. Lamorah Let us sit down upon this log of wood, Or on this mossy-mouthed Rock. My heart Is full of sorrow! Look behold I see An eagle sleeping on his wing half way To Heaven! Count Julian Thine eyes are good to see so far! Lamorah Three Moons ago I lost three arrows at That bird. They fell afar off in yon Lake. Though he soars high, as if he scorned the earth, Yet I will bring him down or lose the fourth. Count Julian Nay, it is vanity to shoot. He looks No larger than thy hand. He pauses on His wings as if he looked from his high world With joy upon his image in the Lake. I see the shadow of his wings stretched out Upon its liquid mirror now. Lamorah My brave Old locust bow! Can you not bring him down? Thrice, with this arrow, hast thou pierced, as far, The Roe-buck leaping on the Sunny Hills. Count Julian Tis vain to shoot. Your arrow will be lost, For see! he has ascended higher still! As if some unseen hand had lifted him Half way to Heaven from mortal sight! His form Has sunk up in the azure Sea of Space! He is an emblem of thy soul, great Chief! I now feel restless to be where he is. Lamorah I never knew him fly so high before. I will not shootâmy arrow may be lost. Count Julian This attitude is fearful to the eye. I wish I was where he is now. Lamorah Sit down, And tell me of thy Dream. I, too, have dreams. Count Julian What is thine age? Lamorah It has been fifty years, With four moons more, since I first came on earth. Count Julian Where are thy children? Hast thou any wife? Lamorah I have a sonâthe Eagle of his Tribe Who dwells afar off with his mother on An Island in the middle of this Lake. Count Julian Have you an Island in this Lake? Lamorah I haveâ The bottom of whose streams are sands of gold. More Swans are there than days in all your life. Count Julian But tell me how you came on it? Are there No people there but yours? Lamorah None but my own. When I was youngâabout your ageâI heard My father talk about this Blessed Isle, Where there was Springtime all the yearâas bright As is Manitolineâthat Spirit-landâ Where Souls reside soon after deathâwhere rests My young Yanassa, Eagle of my heart! Whose bright Inhabitants are just as much More beautiful than any of our race, As spirits are more beautiful than men. For three long years I sought this Blessed Isle. One morning when I rowed out from the shoreâ Just as the Big Lights fired the Hills of Heaven I saw it rise up from the peaceful Lake, Greened with the freshness of immortal Spring. Ah! Then my heart beat loud within my breast! A sound as swift as runs the Roe-buck on The Hills, until I reached the Blessed Spot; When, leaping from my Boat upon the shore, I made the forest woodlands ring with my Ferocious yell, until the frightened birds Fled screaming to the Inland Hills! Then did I walk on it, free as that Bird now soars Through Heaven! Count Julian How far is it from this? Lamorah It takes All night to reach to it. Count Julian But did you find The lovely beings there of whom you spoke? Lamorah I saw nothing but birds, and speckled Fawns, And Roe-bucks leaping on the Sunny Hills. Count Julian How long till you returned? Lamorah Three days. Sad days! When I returned, the White-Man had destroyed My Wigwamâdriven my wife away To seek her shelter on the ground! Hell burned Within my heart to be revenged! So, from That fatal hour I swore never again To smoke the Calumets of Peace with Man! The Tommahawk, that had been in his grave A hundred years, was now dug up again, To rest no more beneath the Tree of Peace! So, on to Cuscovilla's Vale we went Against great Simighan, my father's foe, Panting, like Hell-hounds, for the White-Man's blood. We foughtâour Tribe was slainâslain only Except my son Yanassaâhe alone Escapedâwas taken captive in the fightâ Bound fast in chainsâborne from the field Back to the White-Man's tents, where he had slain The innocent childrenâwhere he lay confined In heavy chains, waiting his awful doom! Count Julian So, old Lamorah, to avenge his deathâ Lamorah Went at the midnight hour, with torch in hand, And fired the old man's houseâ Count Julian That good old Man! Lamorah And as he fled, escaping from the flames, I caught his young Moon-daughter in my arms, And bore her swift away with me! Count Julian Away To some far distant land unknown to Manâ For never tidings came of where she wentâ Leaving young Julian mourning for her lossâ Mourning that he could never more behold The beauty of her Angel-face, nor drink Delight again out of her heavenly smiles, Wherein his soul had sunned itself to peace. Lamorah She was the Virgin of the First Fond Love Who lay upon his bosom like the Swan Upon clear water, while his soul grew white To image back her formâthe very first That made him see the young Hind in his dreams. Count Julian This old Lamorah had two sonsâboth braveâ But his Yanessa, Eagle of his heart The elder loved he better of the two Because he was the White-Man's bitter foe; For many times, Lamorah in his ire, Would fling the White-Man's children in the air, And catch them, falling, on his pointed knife. One day, when he was doing this, he saw one smile, With his blue laughing eyes, right in his face; And from that fatal hour he never smiled! Lamorah, much astonished How know you this? What is thy name? Count Julian And now, At early falling of the leaf, the old man comes From some far distant land unknown to Man, Like Spirit from the dead to those they love, To strew rich Coral on his fathers' graves, And pray beside them while he weepsâfor long Has he been waiting here today to see Some stranger in the person of his son. Lamorah, still more surprised How know you this? Tell me thy name? Thy name? I know thee notâyet, thou hast told me all. Count Julian But she, the Virgin of the First Fond Love, You took away with youâhow old was she? Lamorah Just fifteen fallings of the leaf, with four Moons more. Count Julian Her name? Lamorah Celuta is her name. Count Julian The fairest Maid in all the sunny Southâ The Summer Southâwhere there are many fairâ The only Damsel of her father's houseâ A Farmer's daughter, beautiful as pure, Living in all the rich simplicity Of cottage life alone among the flowersâ A fairer Flower herselfâcalled by her Sire, Ianthe, Lily of the Land of Love. For she was milder than the new-born Moon Sitting, in Silence, on the Hills of Heaven, When, some cloudless night, when all is clear.â Her father's name? Lamorah Was Gordon. Count Julian Brave old Chief! My dream is told. Lamorah Thy dream? What is thy dream? Thy name? I know thee not! Count Julian I am thy sonâ Yanassa from the Land of Souls. Lamorah, much astonished My son? My son? Yanassa? Is it thou, my son? Art thou returned from deathâthe Land of Souls? Thy face is pale! Thou hast the White-Man's face! Yanassa! is it thou? can Death do this? Or has Manito sent thee here to mock My soul by giving thee the White-Man's face? I hate thy faceâhate it as I do hell! Speak to my soul, Yanassa, speak, my son! Count Julian Father! I am thy sonâthy only son! All souls are paleface in the Land of Souls! Where is my mother? brother Ostenee? Celuta! that young Dove! the White-Man's child? The Lily that Yanassa loves so well? Lamorah, with much tenderness Art thou my son? This is his Wampum-belt! This is his Bow! This is his quiver here! These are the garments he wore when slain! Count Julian Father! I am thy sonâthy very son! All souls are pale-face in the Land of Souls. Lamorah, falling on his breast This is my son! my Eagle-boy! my Dove! Yanassa from the Land of Souls! Come home! They enter the boat when Lamorah rows off from the shore. Scene II (A beautiful flower-gemmed Bower on the Island. Ianthe is discovered playing with her fawns. Enter Ostenee, bearing in his hand flowers, shells and Swan Down, unobserved by her.) Ostenee Celuta! Celuta How you frightened me! Ostenee Here are Some shells, my love! I found them on the shore Beside the Lake. Just put this to your ears Does it not sing? Celuta Just like my Dreams last night. Ostenee Its breath is like your sighs, Celuta! Songs Of birds are sweet, but this is sweeter far. It speaks as you did when you spoke to me The White-Man's speech. Oh, speak to me again! I think my brother's soul lives in this Shell! Celuta, offering it to him Hereâthere is magic in the sound! Its sound Is like the memory of departed joys! Hereâtake it, Osteneeâit makes me sad! Ostenee No, it is thine, Celuta. Here's some fruit, As yellow as the White-Man's gold. See how The honey-drops ooze from its pores, like dew Upon fresh flowers. Its sweetness makes me think Of thee! Celuta, offering it again Hereâtake the ShellâI cannot have It any more! It makes me think of homeâ Of one I dreamed about last night. Ostenee Will you Not keep the cradle of my brother's soul, While it is rocked to peace? Celuta No, take it backâ I cannot keep it now. Nay, do not frown; But take it back. Take back the Shellâthe flowersâ And be not angry with your friend. Ostenee My friend? Are you my friend? Then keep the Shellâthe flowersâ And take the Swan-Down that I bring to thee. Celuta But if I take them you will call me yours. Ostenee I willâyou are my loveâmy lifeâmy Heaven! Then take them all. I love you as my soul! Celuta No, Ostenee! You keep them all for meâ Keep them yourself. Ostenee Then you are not my friend? Celuta! Can you lie? Celuta I cannot lie; But would, were I to take your Shells. So, keep Them all to prove Celuta cannot lie. Ostenee By Hell! You love me not! You hate me now! My father gave you unto me! Celuta I dreamed Last night your brother's soul came down from Heaven! Ostenee What! from the Land of Souls? Celuta The Land of Souls! His face was white as snow! Ostenee As snow? His face Was dark. He would not have the White-Man's face! I have been looking for Yanassa long. What said he in thy dream? spoke he of me? Was he not happy with his friends, the dead? Celuta He was not happy with his friends, the deadâ But bade me tell you he must come again, Lest Ostenee should do me wrong. Ostenee What! said he so? When he will come again to claim my love! Thou art my wife, Celuta! but take not The Shell! It was soul that spoke to thee! For often have the souls of mighty men Come back at midnight to their native land, To rest by moonlight in the Ruby-bells. It was no dream! Was he not beautiful, If he had thus the White-Man's face? Celuta His soul Was brighter than the Morning Star! Ostenee As bright As thine? Celuta More beautiful than aught on earth! Ostenee If thou canst bring my brother's soul from Heaven; Canst thou not bring my father back from death? Celuta I canâhe will be here tomorrow morn. I think thy brother will return with him. Ostenee My soul will love thee then as it does now. The Shell I brought thee in my love has broke My heart! How knew the Shell of this? I hearâ It speaks not so to me. Thereâlie on earth! Iâthough I love Yanassa as my life, Yet, he shall never have Celuta's love. Noâhe must go back home again without That heavenly being's loveâay, that he must! For none but spirits should with spirits dwell. Celuta! will you be Yanassa's wife? Celuta The Great High Spirit says it must be so! Ostenee, in rage Then, by deep Hell! though he be white as snowâ Swifter than Roe-buck on the Sunny Hillsâ Stronger than mighty thunderâhe shall die! Celuta Brave Ostenee! his spirit cannot die. A spirit has the strength of many men! Yanassa's arm could kill a thousand such! Ostenee Then he must kill! Where is my locust-bow? My quiver? knife? It must be ground. I have A Spirit from the Land of Souls to fight! I knew his strength before he died. He was The mightiest warriour of my father's tribe! He comes tomorrow morn! My father comes With him. I must be ready for him then. Celuta! Thou art mine! You know you are! And, by yon Big Light in the sky I swear Never shalt thou be made Yanassa's wife (Exit Ostenee) Scene III (The shore of the Beautiful Island. Lamorah's cottage in the distance. He and Count Julian discovered in the boat approaching the shore. Canondah, Lamorah's wife, runs from the cottage to meet them. They land. Canondah, embracing Lamorah. Brave Eagle of my heart! I looked for thee! Celuta said some one would come with you. Come to my arms, my love! hear how the birds Sing but to welcome you on shore again! My heart is full! Lamorah Fond dove! Know you this boy? Bride of Lamorah's soul! this is our sonâ Yanassa from the Land of Souls. Canondah, much astonished My son? Lamorah Thy Spirit-Son come from the Land of Souls. Welcome him home again! Kiss him my love! Canondah The White-Man's son, you mean? Lamorah He is thy son. Canondah You mock me, brave Lamorah! he was dark. Yanassa was not born the White-Man's child. These features are not his. I know my son. Count Julian I see, dear mother! that you know me not. I am thy sonâcome from the Land of Souls. All souls are pale-face in the Land of Souls. Canondah Ah! it is so? the Indian made the White-Man's child? Why did the Great High Spirit change thy face? But, if thou art my son, come to my arms! Thou art my Eagle-boy! Here on this Isle, Where White Man's foot shall never comeâhere, will We spend our days in peace. Celuta said Some one would come with you. Count Julian She did? Then our two souls have been together, though Our bodies have been far apart! Bright Soul! But where is Ostenee? Canondah At home. Alas! Our Eagle-Boy has seen some Evil-One! Last night he saw a Star fall down from Heaven, And kiss Celuta while she slept! Lamorah Fond dove! It was Yanassa from the Land of Souls She must not see Yanassa's spirit-face Nor Morning Star of loveâas white as hersâ For she would love him from her very soulâ And Ostenee would take his life! So, you Must keep her far away from him, until I paint his face, when he may call her sisterâ Until we send him far away from us, When she can leap into his arms with joy, And be his wife.âNow kiss our Spirit-Boy. (They enter the Cottage) Curtain falls End of Act the First Act II Scene I (Celuta's Bower of Bliss. Enter Count Julian in Yanassa's garb with his face painted red.) Count Julian Here on this Isle are trees of every sort. The Lemon, Orange, Lentiek, Poplar, Pine. Large Orange trees, that blossom while they bear, Burthened with fruit of pure deliciousness, Like globes of vegetable gold on boughs Of lustrous emerald growing, flourish hereâ Fruit of Ambrosial richness fit for Gods. (Count Julian pauses, entranced, listening to distant, though delightful, music, which presently rises up out of the bosom of the stream.) The Naiad's Song In the sky blue zone that bound her She came skipping to my brink, While the flowers grew up around her, As she knelt her down to drink. Then she fondled with my willows, While her snowy flesh lay in The bright bosom of my billows, Where no other form had been. Then she whispered words if spoken Unto mortal ears, would seem As the bright, the heavenly token Of her heart in Love's Young Dream. But, believe me, mortal lover! I would never trust her more; For she told me, oftimes That she never loved before. And, that, never more, in Summer, She may bathe her limbs in me, Is the cause of this sad murmur, As I hasten to the sea! Count Julian Is this some Naiad singing in her stream Whose solemn cadences fall on my soul, Little mournful memories of departed days? Or, is it some sweet song spinn'd off, in beams, From some bright star, new-born in Heaven in its First cycle round the Sun above? Or, is It one of Phoebus' Swans, fresh from the skies, Carolling the language of Heaven on earth, The music of the happenings in Heaven? It floats in crystal echoes down the stream, Like some sweet golden flow of rich perfumes From twice ten thousand urns of fragrant flowers, Flooding my soul with odorous melody! (Distant music heard again.) I hear sweet song again! It nicely comes From Heaven, or some blest place where all is pure; For it is sweeter than the Naiad's song Which I believed descended from the skies Most worthy to be born of Angels' tongues! For here, in this enchanted Bower, it seems, Angels, invisible to all beside, In shining garments, minister to me! (Distant music again) It comes again! There must be Spirits here! No mortal ere sung such song as thatâ Sweeter than Syren ever sang! For now The freshening dew of golden melody Falls on my more than ravished soul, like dew Upon parched flowersâor tidings of great joy To him who has been strickened by the world! I know that Voiceâit beckons me to comeâ And I must goâOn! on, rapt Julian! on! It is prophetic of what is to be! (Exit) Scene II (The beautiful Lake of Swans in the distance. Ianthe is discovered bathing in the Lake, while the most delightful music is heard rising up out of the bosom of the Lake around her form. Enter Count Julian. Count Julian in raptures) Behold! Ianthe, like the Crescent Moon Cloudless in Heaven, in her own beauty clad, As glorious to the Isles, as she to Nightâ Swimming about through all the placid Lake, Drawn by two silver Swans together yoked, Like some fair Naid in her native stream! While through the emerald alleys crowned with flowers A liquid music comes from all the streams, Like the pathetic light formed from the Moon Upon some cloudless night when all is clear Rising up, odor-like, around the form, Soothing her sighing soul to heavenly peace! It is the music of Celestial Love, Speaking, in mystic language, to her soulâ Sweet as the Choral Symphonies of Stars, As heavenly harmony of the Pleiades! (Exit Ianthe in haste) Now she has gone into her Bower of Bliss, Where, all alone, seen only by the Flowers, That kiss with their delicious, odorous lips Her more delicious, heavenly, odorous form! This Flower of Paradise reclothes herselfâ Or, rather, she is by the Graces clad! (The same music, attending her, is heard in the distance.) Impatient now to gaze once more on Heaven, On whose bright threshold I now seem to stand, And hear the songs of Seraphim withinâ (Like him who, little ere his death, did hear A strain of music in the airâ) I go To follow her to her sweet Hiding place! (Exit.) Scene III (The Bower of Bliss, as in Scene First, Ianthe is discovered sitting on a mossclad rock combing her hair. Enter Count Julian.) Count Julian I am Yanassa from the Land of Souls. Who came to you last night in that Most heavenly dream, wherein you seemed to see The Great High Spirit say must be Your husband in this world. Come, thou art mine! Ianthe (rising) Not in this worldânor in the World To Come! I will be Julian's bride, or none at all! I pledged myself to him in youthâgave him My heart, my soul, my life, my loveâmy all! What have I, then, to give to you? Although You woo me with the same sweet breathâ(with such Sweet, heavenly eloquence you seem the sameâ) Yet, I am hisâI gave my heart to him, And cannot take it back to give to you, Or any one besidesâbecause it is Not mine to give! Therefore, implore me notâ For, know, the more you speak to me in his Sweet eloquence (for well I know he taught You thus to speak) the more you plead for himâ The closer do you bind my soul to hisâ The farther do you separate that soul From all on earth!âfor I am his alone! Count Julian But he is dead! Ianthe Dead? Is my Julian dead? Oh! tell meâIs he dead? Count Julian I saw him die! There is the letter that you sent to himâ Confided, on his deathbed to my care. These were his dying words: Go, my poor soul! To that bright Isle, where she now waits for me And take her to your heartâmake her your wifeâ And tell her we shall meet again in Heaven! Ianthe Ah! that we will! there we shall meet again! My dream is now interpreted to me. That was the night he died! There he was on His way to Heaven! But, then, he told me we Should meet again on earth. This was my dream. It cannot be that be that we must part so soonâ That he has gone forever more from meâ Never to see me in this world again! Oh! God! look down upon my wretched soul, And save me from this trying world of sin! No, I will not despairâI yet will hope That we may meet againâmeet here on earth And be united as we were of yoreâ When he was all the Heaven I wished on earth, And I was his dear Angel in this Heaven! This is the only solace that I have To comfort me on earth; this side of Heaven! Which is enough to keep me true to him, True to the latest moment of my life! Count Julian Why should you live here all alone, beset By Ostenee, from day to day, who tempts You only to betrayârather than wed With him whom Julian loved even as his soul? Who gave you on his deathbed to my care, As his own soul's most sacred legacy? Ianthe Poor Ostenee! he tempts me not! But know, Since you have failed to win me from myselfâ From more than mine own soulâ(for well I know He taught you how to speak such heavenly words) How can he hope to gain my love? It is More vain than even for you to tryâwhich is The very soul of vanity itself! I will be Julian's bride aloneâhis wifeâ Or die the maid I am! Count Julian These are wild words! Will you affirm that you are true to him, And yet, deny his dying wish to me? The last fond words that came from out his soul, And did to him announce on his trembling tongue? Ianthe Were he so false as to request such thing, I am not false enough to grant it him. Count Julian Then, by Manito! If you will not grant This dying wish to meâ(seeing that you Are false to himâ) it will be nothing more Than right for me to force you to obey! For there can be no joy to him in Heaven, Who knows his Heaven on earth is false to him. Therefore, to glad his soul in Heaven, you must Be made, this day, Yanassa's bride on earth. Ianthe Never on earth, nor in the World to Come Therefore, implore me never more! Before I will be any thing but what I amâ (If he be dead)âI will go up to him In Heaven, sent by this right hand to dwell Forever moreâthere I will be at peace! Count Julian But I would snatch the weapon from your hand, And make you mine in spite of you! Ianthe Alas! Would you, Yanassa, from the Land of Souls, There all good things resideâwhere Angels dwellâ Arrayed in shining robes of lightning-fireâ Would you betray the trust reposed in you, By him who is an Angel now in Heaven? When he requested you to be my friend, Long after he was dead, on earth? Count Julian His last Request was not that I should be your friend, But husband. Ianthe Husband be you, then, to me. By being what you ought to beâmy friend! Then will you husband me from all things vileâ Preserve me, safely, for your friend in Heaven, Where I now hope to meet him soon in joy, And thank you, with an Angel's lips of fire, In words melodious to your grateful soul, And God reward you for your kindness done To me on earth! Will you not do this thing? I know you will! Yanassa is too good At heart, too noble-souledâto injure one Who never did him wrongânot even in thought! Say you will not compel me thus to die Before my timeâbefore I have begun To live!â'gainst NatureâGod's most holy Lawâ And I will live to bless you here on earth, Or, dying, curse you in this worldâthe world To come! Speak! that my soul may know its doom! Count Julian Ianthe! virgin Dian of this Isle! Most worthy to be queen of all the world! Fairest of all the fair ones ever born My Morning Star! my ever new Delight! My joy on earth! my hopes of bliss in Heaven! Behold! it is your Julian clasps you now! Ianthe What! Julian? Julian! is this you? Oh! God! Such deep Angelic love now fills my soul, It cannot be expressed but by the aid Of Sorrow, Christian sister of pure Joyâ As if an Angel now should roup because She woo in Heavenâhad too much heavenly bliss! Count Julian But Beauty looks most beautiful in tears Oh! my Ianthe! Dayspring of my life! Is not this rapturous ravishment of joy, Born of the melting of two souls in oneâ The bright Apocalypse of Heaven on earth? Ianthe A perfect Apotheosis of Love! Oh! wonderous Miracle of Truth on earth! Thou Paragon of man! where all are false! But how could you be any thing but true? Rapt with the sinless plenitudes of bliss, My soul seems soaring now on Angel's wings, Up to the Sapphire shining Mount of God! Count Julian A joy prophetic of your future fate. For he who pants for immortalityâ Who searches after good for its own sakeâ Who loves the Beautiful Natural Truthâ Wherein an Angel stands, in robes of light Calling his raptured spirit home to Godâ As when Correggio saw, in his last sleep, Great Palestrina standing at the Gates Of Heaven, waiting to welcome him to bliss! Now that the rapture of divine delight Has settled to the calmness of sweet peaceâ The quick short breathing of deep joy merged in The slow, sad sighings of contentâhere let Us mingle our impassioned souls in oneâ Ianthe No, that can never be until we wed! We are not wedded yet, nor can be, till We go back home again. Count Julian Back home again? How can that be, when old Lamorah has The only key that locks the Boat-chain round The Willow tree? Should we attempt to leave This blessed Isle, we would be both condemned To die by fire! No, let us here remain, And love each other in connubial bliss. Ianthe No, love! although I love you as my life More than my own dear soul. Who loves the Beautiful in Natural Truth, Because it is the Essence of all good That man ascends to Heaven before he diesâ Beholds the gates of Glory opened wide, Whom an Angel stowes, in robes of light. Because God wedded Adam to Eve In Paradise. So let us be, that we May be like they were ere the fall. Count Julian We will And it shall be as thou hast said it is. Now, by that most mysterious Law of Love, Born of the God of Loveâare our two souls United into one! Now must we use The utmost cunning of our souls, that we May best elude Lamorah's watchful eyes, Until such time as we can make our safe Retreat back home again, where we will live, And love each other in connubial bliss. (Exeunt) Curtain Falls End of Act Second Act III Scene I (The Bower of Bliss. Count Julian is discovered lying on a mosscovered rock asleep. Enter Endea who gazes on him with delightful astonishment.) Endea Is this some Angel God has sent to me From Heaven to recompense me for my love, And for the Orphan-life that I have lived? For surely he was never born on earth! Such beauty never walked this world before! I feel entrancedârapt with delightâto see Such heavenly beauty lying here on earth, The very soul that I have seen in dreams, Smiling upon me from the Bowers of Heavenâ Whom I have called my husband in my sleep! (She approaches him, kneels down by him, combs back his locks with her fingers, when he wakes.) Count Julian (taking her hand) Why, who is this, so beautiful, I pray, Whom I now grasp so fondly by the hand? I thought it was Celuta by my side! Art thou some Angel sent to me from Heaven To minister to my delight? or some Fair Naiad, Nymph, or Dian of this Isle, Sent here in absence of Celuta's face? For surely there was never one more fair, Or beautiful than thou art now! A bright New Moon about the Folding Story of Love Bright as that glorious Goddess of pure day, its joy, Fresh from the Fauna upon the Cyprian Isle! So that my soul could love you as it does Celuta, were Celuta not my soul! Tell me, fair Angel! what is thy sweet name? Endea (with tender emotion) My name is EndeaâOrphan of the House Of old Lamorah, who is called my sire. My real father's name was Simighanâ A bold Castillian from the Land of Spain, Who married old Lamorah's sisterâslain By Outalissa, son of Miscou, Chief In Cuscovilla's Valley near the sea, Where rolls the mighty river of Mobile. The Angels called him Lopezâbut the name My mother called him by, was Simighan. My mother died to see my father die! (She weeps. Enter Celuta on the outside of the Bower, who stops and watches them.) Count Julian Nay, do not weep! Why do you weep, my love? I will be father, mother, friend to you, And you shall never want for any thing! Come, dry those dove-like eyes! You must not weep! Though Beauty looks most beautiful in tears! Endea Alas! how can you be my husband here, And love Celuta so? My heart is broke! Count Julian Fair One! it hurts my heart to see you weep! Comeâyou shall never want for any thing! Endea Alas! how can you do all this for me, And love Celuta so? My heart is broke! Count Julian Why, Endea? Would you have me cast away Celuta from my soul, who is my soul? Endea Do as you pleaseâyou cannot love us both! Alas! I am an orphan here on earth! My parents both are dead! My God! my God! How can I ever call you mine, when you Do love Celuta so? My heart is broke! Count Julian Come Endea! do not weep! but smile, my love! And I will love you from my very soul! Endea No! Take Celuta! Take her to your heart! You say she is your wifeâyour very soulâ You never can be mine! All hope is gone! And I can only die! So, fare-you-well! (Starting away.) Count Julian Why, Endea! is it possible you mean To leave me so abruptly? Do not go! But sit here by me on this mossy rock, And let me tell you all my love. Come back! And you shall be the queen of half my heart! (She returns.) Endea You mock me when you say you love me so! You doâyou do! You never can be mine! How can you, when you love Celuta so? Count Julian No, by my soul! I love you as my life! Comeâyou must go to where Celuta is, And there remain until I come to you. She has a thousand things to say to you, Of which you little dream. Say, will you go? Endea I will; for I have many things to say To her. Count Julian Farewell! Kiss her as I kiss thee! (He kisses her and she goes.) (Enter Celuta) Celuta What have I done to make you treat me so? Alas! there is no truth this side of Heaven! Far better had it been for me that you Had never seen my face, than treat me so! Count Julian By heaven! You wrong me! that you do my love! Celuta She was my friendâhas been for three long yearsâ Is this the way that she requites my love? By trying to seduce my soul from me? But why should I blame her for being false, When you, the Jewel of my heart, have been? How frail I was to think that you were true! I never will be so deceived again! You have forgotten what you said to her You swore that you would love her while you lived! What more could you have said to her than this? This was the promise that you made to me! How can you love us both? From this time forth, A fire is to be kindled in my heartâ A raging fireâwhich Time shall never quench! We cannot live together in one place! If she remain, I will desert this Bower! What peace can I now see with Endea here, Who once was dearer to me than my life? Count Julian By Heaven! I never loved but you alone! I told fair Endea that I never did! Come, my Celuta! Come into my arms! Like fair Egeria to her Numa's soul! And lifting up thy deep blue eyes to mine, And swimming with unshed throes of pure delight, Throw thy soft tapering arms around my neck White as fresh lilies from the Fields of Heavenâ As if by all the Graces moulded thusâ Shaming perfection with their perfectnessâ And after sealing they deep, newawakened love To the lips pureâlet fall thy languid head In blissful cose, upon my panting breast! (Reenter Endea, who, perceiving them, retraces her steps.) Go, my Celuta! call her back again! (Exit Celuta) Poor Endea! she is ready now to die! For she has lived just long enough to love, Which is life's prelude unto Death to all Who have not been requited with the same; For we have but two minuits here to liveâ The first one is to loveâthe next to die! This is the language of the great Jean-Paul. In Endea's case it is the sacred truth (Reenter Celuta attended by Endea. Celuta retires with Count Julian into the interior of the bower, where they converse unheard.) Endea Who can this be? this Julian so divine? Is this the lover that she told me of? It must be so from what he says of herâ Whom I believed descended from the skies. My God! am I not wretched in this world? Am I not doubly orphaned here on earth? Surely I amâfor I have lost all here! What shall I do? he is Celuta's love! I know he is! Celuta is his wife! He is the one to whom the Dove was sent. I saw the letter he returned to her, He has been long expected on this Isle. If this be so, he never can be mine! And never to be mineâhow can I live? Oh! when I look upon his face, I feel As if I were in Heavenâall full of lightâ But when I turn my eyes away from him, I then see nothing but the darkest night, And his Celuta standing in the dark! And, yet, I have not known him for an hour! But what of that? he is my soul! the rich Embodiment of all my Dreams of Heaven! And losing himâI have no hope butâHell! But when did he arrive? how came he here? Lamorah says that no one ever came Upon this Isle without his knowing it. A thought now strikes me. Is he not disguised As young Yanassa from the Land of Souls? It must be so, that is the reason why He will not seek Lamorah's house again. I know I should not have Celuta's loveâ But, yet, I cannot live unless I do. One only hope is left me now on earthâ A heritage which no one can deprive Me ofâthe privilege bequeathed to all Mankind by Heavenâthe privilege to die! I know, to lose him, will be living death! Therefore, to die, will be to live againâ Free from the living death that I now die! Count Julian (coming forward with Celuta) These were the pure outpourings of her heart, In its most sinless moment, full of love, And in the burning bliss that love inspires. Celuta The soul that loves is filled with part of Godâ Thereby, possessing riches in the skies; For when you lay your hand upon her formâ A Virgin whose pure heart is full of loveâ You lay your hand upon high Heaven on earth! (approaching Endea) Come, Endea! take Count Julian's arm; We have consulted what is best to do. We are now going from this Bower of Bliss This Daphnian Grove of Joyâinto our Cave, Where, banqueting upon the nectared Sweets That thy Celuta has prepared for thee, We will converse about the days that were, When, on the morning-side of youth, we played Beneath the fragrant Orange Grove at noon, Beside the living Palm-tree Wells, in joy, Before the Night of Sorrow had come down To chase the golden sunshine from our hearts. Endea Ah! with poor Endea Joy can never dwell! Not through the vistas of long, trying yearsâ Nor through the desert-waste of this dark lifeâ Can hie pure Memory now one single joyâ No bright Elysian Fields of Happiness, Where have gathered flowers in infancyâ Drinking pure pleasure from the cup of blissâ Pass in review to make her sad soul glad! But all is barrennessâbeforeâbehindâ An ocean boundless of Saharian sandâ Which threatens now to overwhelm her soul! (Exeunt omnes.) Scene III (A magnificent cave. Enter Count Julian, attended by Celuta and Endea.) Count Julian Within this Temple's grand, magnificent nave, Studding with ever variant hues the domeâ Myriads of crystals blaze, like diamond flowers, All newly blown, immortal in their blazeâ A petrified Parterre, bright as the Palace-home Of Genie in the realms of Fairy-land. Columns of glittering granite-pillars high Of Crimson Porphyre, like Trophies torn From mighty things in battle for the world. Such is the splendor of the place when seen. By torch-light, blazing high in glory bright Like fragments of pure Beauty torn from out The burning starsâforever burning here! More beautiful than that Corycian cave, The residence of all the Nymphs of Pan. Or that delightful cave we read of in The Hesperian Land, where Saturn with His people spent the Golden Age in peace. For, in this subterranean Vatican, Of Nature's most superior workmanshipâ The rich embodiment of myriad thoughtâ Exprest in crystals, far surpassing all The richest Statuary in the worldâ As if they were the leisure thoughts of Gods, In emulation of some Work Divine Done by the Maker of the world in Heaven. (Exeunt into the interior of the cave.) Scene IV (Lamorah's Cottage. Lamorah and Canondah are discovered on the outside as in conversation. Enter Ostenee in haste.) Ostenee Father! they have escaped! Lamorah Escaped? What now? Ostenee Your son Yanassa, from the Land of Souls, Has taken CelutaâEndeaâall with him! Why did my brother take my love away? Celuta said, before he came, she was To be his bride! But why take Endea too? She was my Playmateâjewel of my heartâ The first that I did ever love in life! Celuta was my lastâmore beautifulâ More rosy-white than Endea, whose divine Complexion was pure olive, clear as Heaven! One was the Eveningâone, the Morning Star! Dear Endea! She was timid as the Doveâ Wild as the Partridge that was never tamedâ So timid that she trembled at herself, And feared the shadow of her own pure form. I loved her though she would not love me back, And, would have given the Stars for herâall worlds For fair Celuta!ânow they both are gone!â By yonder Big-Light in the sky! if they Are on this Isle, I yet will find them out, And take revenge upon Yanassa's soul, For this great thing that he has done to me! (Starting away) Lamorah Where go you now? Ostenee I go to seek my soul, And yours, Yanassa from the Land of Souls. Lamorah Lend me your dagger then; I want to kill A Roe-buck ere you come again. Ostenee (handing him the dagger) Farewell! I go again to find themâor to die! (Exit Ostenee) Lamorah (to Canondah) While wandering through the woods, the other day, I saw two persons near the Lake of Swans, Walking together towards the Bower of Blissâ Celuta with Yanassa, arm in arm. I watched them till they both went in the Bower; Then, sitting down beneath an aged Oak, I heard such blissful music from the Bower Rolling in rivers of Celestial Songâ That all the Isle seemed overflowed with joy! Such deep Seraphic rapture tranced my soul, That I seemed led away in golden chains Into the Fields of Immortality, Where came the Good Departed of the world, With open arms to welcome me to blissâ Bidding me join them in the happy Chase! So, that, I lost all memory of all things, Except my father's love which then came back To me with all its pristine purity, Till all that once was pleasant to my soulâ The pleasures of the Chaseâthe sound of streams, The smell of woodsâthe Banqueting of Soulsâ And all the bright things of the living worldâ Came floating down the river of that song, As floats some mighty Ship upon the sea, When all the ocean boils like liquid fire This was the song that young Yanassa sung When he was in the Land of Souls, beside The throne of Ataensic, where now sing, The Great Departed of the world in bliss! Such song was never sung on earth before! He never used to sing before his deathâ Nor was his song melodious to my ear. Canondah Cause, in the Land of Souls, they know all things. Lamorah In what he learnt by going up to Godâ More than the greatest Man could ever know Were he to live on earth ten thousand years! I thank the White-Man that he killed my son They thought that they had broke my heart By driving his pure soul above the starsâ (Damning their own foul souls to injure mine!â) But they were wrong, as they have ever been! Although I fell to pieces for awhile, Yet, it was all made whole again by that Sweet Song! I think that I shall never more, On earth, this side of Bright Manitoline, hear such Another song, so sweet to me as that! So now, you go into the Bower of Bliss, And see Yanassaâtell him to beware, Or he will die againâif die he canâ Who has been once, twice, in the Land of Soulsâ For Ostenee, his brother, seeks his life. Then back return to me again with both My daughters, when I will unfold to him How he may best escape his brother's wrath. If he will not return, bring Endea home With you. She shall obey if he will not. (Exit Canondah as Lamorah enters the cottage) Scene V (The Bower of Bliss. Count Julian is discovered sitting alone reading. Enter Canondah.) Canondah My son! Yanassa from the Land of Souls! Your brother Ostenee is mad with you, And means, if you can die, to take your life! Lamorah says: Return into his House, And bring with you CelutaâEndea, too. Count Julian Well, he is welcome to as much of it As he can take. Go, mother! tell him so. Tell my old father I will not return. (Exit Canondah. Count Julian falls asleep. Enter Ostenee with cautious steps. Count Julian wakes.) Count Julian (sitting up) Who are you, going at me so, with eyes As red as Hell? What business have you here? Ostenee (indignantly) Why, from the garb you wear, you ought to know. Count Julian I know you notânor do I care to know. Ostenee (sarcastically) They tell me that you are my father's sonâ His young Yanassa from the Land of Souls! But, then, you seem to me far too pale To be my brother, or my father's son! Count Julian All souls are pale face in the Land of Souls! Ostenee But you are not now on the Land of Souls! Count Julian I should dispute with you were you not here. Ostenee Where is Celuta?âtell me where she is!â My brother has been most unkind to meâ To take CelutaâEndea from me too! Do they have traitors in the Land of Souls? Do they make liars in Manitoline? For, if they do, may Ataensic's arm Forever save me from that cursed place! Where is my Endea? Tell me where she is! Or, by Manito! I will take your life! Count Julian (springing on his feet) What mean you by such angry words as these? What mean you by such words, you copper snake? You talk as though you were the Lord of life, And had all power to take mine when you please! But know, Yanassa cannot die by you! If any one must die, you are the Man! Ostenee Then give me Endea! tell me where she is, Or I must die! Count Julian Then you must die, indeed, For I shall never tell. So, go your way. Ostenee Give me my Endea! tell me where she isâ Or I will tear your heart out with my hands, And dash it to the dogs! You know, too well. She was my Playmateâsister of my heartâ And cousin of my soul!âGive me my wife! (Enter Ianthe rushing into Count Julian's arms) Ianthe Oh, Julian! Julian! This is Ostenee! Beware of him! he comes to take your life! Ostenee Ah! âJulian! Julian,â did she say? She did! It isââJulian!â By Hell's everlasting King! I thought you were my father's oldest sonâ His young Yanassa from the Land of Souls! Instead of thatâyou are the White-Man's child! The murderer of Yanassa for his clothes! This was his dress. I know Yanassa's clothes. But âJulian!ââthat was not my brother's name. Now I see the serpent in your eye! Now can I take revenge upon you good! But by Hell's most infernal King! I know Not how to muster up sufficient words, Red hot from Hell, to curse thy damned soul! What! murder my own brother for his clothes? Then cheat my father in them to his face? Coming upon this Isle to steal my wife! This is the White-Man's game! this is his sport! You cannot play this game on me! You fooled My fatherâbut you cannot fool his son! No, âJulian!â pale face chicken hearted brat! You cannot fool my father's son! Come on! (Exit Ianthe in affright. Ostenee seizes Count Julian. They fight manfully for some time. Count Julian, grasping him by the throat, at length conquers him, leaving him lying on the ground as if dead, from which, after a little, he springs up and runs for his life. Reenter Ianthe). Ianthe Oh! Julian! Julian! Are you hurt my love? Count Julian No! Let us follow him. See how he runsâ Leaving a blue streak after him in flight! Ianthe No, let us go into our cave. Come, love! (Exeunt) Scene VI (Lamorah's cottage as before. Lamorah and Canondah are sitting as in conversation.) Lamorah Then, by Manito! He may meet his doom! Whatever fate may fall on himâmay fall! He never shall be warned by me again! I am an old man nowâtoo full of years To trouble my old hand about such dogs! Where is Celuta? saw you Endea there? Canondah He would not tell me where Celuta was Nor where the young Fawn of my heart was hidâ Whether among the Valley Reeds alone, Or with Celuta, fairest of the fair, The milk white beauty of the Isle of Founts, Feeding her cygnets by the Lake of Swans, Or lived afar off in some mighty Oak; But treated me with bitter, cold disdain, As young Yanassa never did in life. He looks not like Yanassa nowânor isâ But only wears the garb Yanassa wore. The paint you put upon his face is gone. Lamorah The Great High Spirit knows that he is falseâ False to the father that he seemed to love! It was not so before he diedânot so! Have they false children in the Land of Souls? Sure Ataensic would not suffer this. For how can disobedience dwell in Heaven? And how can disobedience dwell in him Who sang so sweetly in the Bower of Bliss? If he prove false to me, in whom my soul Was so wrapped upâthere is no rest on earth! (Enter Ostenee in haste.) What! are you shunning death, or flying from The Devil, that you run so swiftly home? When you have breath enough to speak, speak out! And tell me what great Wonder you have seen! Ostenee A Wonder you may say! Lamorah So it appears! Ostenee A hellish, fiendish Devil called your sonâ The young Yanassa from the Land of Souls! Who murdered your Yanassa for his clothesâ Cheating you in them to your very faceâ Coming upon this Isle to steal my wife! For know, the traitor that you call your son, Was never dead, nor in the Land of Soulsâ (Would to the great Manito that he were!) But is a White Man! âJulianâ is his name! He is Celuta's husbandâcurse his soul! Who came within an inch of murdering meâ I only saving life by swiftest flight! Lamorah What do I hear? Who told you of this thing? Ostenee Celuta didâthat Dove of Heavenâwho called Him âJulianââcalled!him by his proper name! I tell you that his face is white as snow! Think you Yanassa from the Land of Souls, Or Hell, would not remember Ostenee? This villian knew me not, nor cared to know! I tell you he is âJulianâ in disguiseâ After killing your son to cheat you in his clothes! Oh! father! if you value your own life, Or love the life of any one on earthâ Shew forth the thunder of your vengeance now! For no one ever knew this Isle before, But our own family! Now he is here! A few short months will roll around in Heaven, When he will bring ten thousand White Men here To sweep us from the Earth! This Isle was ours; But it will never more be ours again! Lamorah You say you fought? Ostenee We did for one whole hour! Lamorah And, from your flight, he foiled you in the fight? Ostenee He did by choking meâwhich no one could Have helped! Lamorah But are you sure he's not my son? Say, are you sure of it? Ostenee I know he's not! I know Yanassa's garb too well! Thy son! He is the White Man come to take this Isle! Lamorah Where is Manito that He will not hear? In what sulphurous lair of cloud, afar Off in the mighty realms of space, now sleep The Eternal Thunderbolts of God, that they Do not descend in lightnings on his head?â Come, Ostenee go quicklyâtake this keyâ Unlock the Boat chain from the Willow treeâ Get in the Boatâfly swiftly through the Lakeâ Rowing as mortal never rowed beforeâ Until you reach the farthest shore! Then goâ Walk notâbut run, as runs the Roebuck on The Hills, when goaded on to swiftest flight By Hounds with open mouths, whose eager cries Tell how they long to drink his pure heart's bloodâ To Ouithlacoochee's Isle of Fountsâbring back With you great Ensenore, the Man of men! Areskou's mighty thunderbolt of War! And Esnah, Captain of the Sons of Night; And old Tekoah, Captain of the Braveâ Bloody Avengers of their father's slain! Bring fifty warriorsâten fair Virgins pureâ To celebrate the Banqueting of Souls! For on that night that foul traitor's soulâ Translated in a Chariot of Fireâ Amid the shouts of his exultant foes Go back again into the Land of Souls!â End of Act Third Act IV Scene I (The Bower of Bliss. Count Julian is discovered alone reading. Loud yells are heard without. Enter Ostenee attended by ten warriors, who seize upon him.) Count Julian (with great indignation) Back Cowards! Traitors! villians that you are! What! ten foul beaten dogs against one Man! Ten famishing Wolves to gnaw out one Man's heart! Oh! be ashamed! blush all your cheeks to ire! Burn them to cinders with repentant shame! Foul, painted Devils hot from burning Hell! Who sent you here? What villian brought you here? This coward Ostenee? This valiant whipt Dog leader of his hang tail brother Dogs! I see the choking that I gave him here The other day, has left him rather hoarse! How dare you come again to me, who ran So swiftly home from me, the other day? Untie these handsâyou know their iron graspâ And I will make you run againâwhip all These famished bloodhounds till they break their necks Back into Hell again, where they belong! Ostenee (to the warriors) Away with him! the Council shall decide His fate!âRejoice! for thou shalt die tonight! Count Julian May Hell's eternal Serpents gnaw thy soul! (Exeunt omnes) Scene II (Night. The Valley of Violets. Enter Endea in search of Count Julian.) Endea (falling on her knees and praying to the Moon.) Daughter of Heaven! bright Angel of the Night! Have ye no Julian in the realms of light, In whose bright presence ye can bask in joy? Oh! if ye have, look down upon me now, And from that Land where Julian says is God, Send me some token in your hallowed beams, How thou dost live continuing still to loveâ Paleâpale with ever looking on his faceâ Sister! for thine is unrequited love! And let thy vigils teach me how to wait! I knew that he must stand, ere long, before The Ten fair Virgins of the Purple Hills, And there give out his dying soul to God! Oh! thou fair Moon! image of that sweet peace Which never more can come to this sad heart! Come through the Orange-scented groves of Night, Dewy with Nature's tearsâbeaded with thineâ (For now I feel them falling on my cheeksâ My palid cheeksâpalid as thineâmore paleâ) And pour upon my heart thy healing! Shed down from thy pale face of mild silence, Part of the peace which thy pure heart doth know And make my weary soul as calm as thine! Melt from the Heaven of my poor soul, oh, Moon, The sorrowâclouds which hang about it now, Hiding from it the face divine of Joyâ That blue-eyed Dove of Immortality Which flew down out of God's great Golden Throne, And in the tender roseleaves of my heart When Love first haunted me in heavenly Dreams, There built its nest, until the Vultureâgriefs That nestle there, made it their inocent prey! Or, if not melt, gild them with thy pure beams, That I may have light, once more on my soul, Before I go down to the narrow grave From whence I never more shall come again! Oh! Julian! Julian! how my heart doth beat, Shaking my lips like roseleaves in the air, Until I bend like Willows in the stormâ Nearly uprooted all my tree of lifeâ Merely to mention thy sweet, heavenly name!â Oh! Moon! if thou canst help meâhelp! Subdue this stormy sorrow of my soul! If there is any Medicine in Heaven, Oh! bring it down to me in thy sweet beamsâ For thy mild splendor is the aid I want! That is the Aegis that my soul requires! For Julian says the Sun of Righteousness Descends from Heaven with healing in its beam! Be thou my sun of Righteousness, Oh! Moon! Make mild this deathless fever of my heartâ Subdue this tender tumult of my soulâ With which I dieâby which I loveâmy lifeâ My living death! Oh, I shall surely die! For if it leaves me without being cured, I shall be cold in death when it abates! Then help, oh, Moon! if thou canst help meâhelp! I goâthine eyes are weeping on me now! My locks are wetâwet with thine own pure tears! And all the stars seem mourning for me now! (Exit) Scene III (Night. The Indian Council discovered. The four great Kings are sitting on their Beaver-mantled thrones. The ten fair Virgins crowned with beautiful Rosettes, with pendants of pure pearl in their ears, and the richest Coral around their necks, are seated on their Swan-down mantled thrones in the same circle with the Kings, having on flowing robes tipt with the down of Swans. In the center is the Council Fire, around which are seated the fifty Warriours, painted red for war, crowned with Catamount's heads, with Tiger tails hanging down their backs, all having tomahawks in their hands. Count Julian is standing on the right hand fastened to a tree, guarded by Ostenee. Ensenore (rising and standing on his throne) Great Warriours! You may now begin the dance. You know we have no Warriour here tonight, To stretch upon the Cypress-Bier in deathâ None having diedâtherefore, rejoice the moreâ For so Areskou wills it from above. Then we begin the Banqueting of souls, An anual Festival we celebrate, Commemorative of our father's deeds, Which shall not perish to the latest time. (Ensenore resumes his seat, when two Virgins of the Beautiful Ten, heralded by wild and joyful music, descend from their Swan-down moulted thrones, holding over their heads between their fingers, an Ossier bough, with which they dance to the front of the stage, causing the Roses, as they embrace, to meet on their bosoms, and after looking timidly between them on the Council, retire to their thrones amid shouts of applause, when two others descend and dance as they have done, until the whole ten have danced. The Warriours then arise with most exultant shouts, hopping, dancing, tumbling round the fire, until Lamorah rises from his Beaver-mantled throne, and waves his right hand over them, when they all sink down in silence on the ground again. Then the four great Kings and the ten fair Virgins sing a rapturous Paean for their own souls.) Paean Lord of the Stars of Night, thy love Is ever beaming from above! Thy name is written in the skyâ In the bright Spirit Land on high! Then Shepherd us to thy rich folds, And, Lord! have mercy on our souls! They are appointed to be bright, And to make glad the Halls of Night; And from the Chambers of the West To beacon us away to rest! Then Shepherd us to thy rich folds, And, Lord! have mercy on our souls! Oh! in the fulness of thy power, Pour on the Offering of this hour The healing incense of thy love, And lift our Sacrifice above! Then Shepherd us to thy rich folds, And, Lord, have mercy on our souls! Ensenore (rising) Brave Warriours! you may cease the War Dance now, And, in the Temple of the Night, sit still, Looking, at intervals, up at the stars, That your High Heaven, while listening to the mute lipsâ (Thanking Manito that you are not white) To hear the trial of this faithless Dogâ Rejoice, young Man! for thou shalt die tonight! The Dead came to me in their windingsheets Last night, crying, âThe Calumet is gone! The Tomahawk has been dug up again, To rust no more beneath the Tree of Peace! Rise up, my Ensenore, avenge my wrongs!â I rose. The pale face of my murdered friend Stood at my door! âSpeak not!â said heâ The door of Hell shall be unlockedâyes, wide! The White-Man shall not chain me there! No-no! The hands that thou didst chain a few short hours Ago, will drag thee to the Desert, where The Wolf shall fatten on thy cursed corpseâ And hungry Vultures peck thy damned eyes! Lamorah (rising) When old Lamorah's father lived, he had A daughter whom he loved above all thingsâ For he had made her Queen of all his Tribe. One day, when he was gone, the White Man came, And, throwing in the Lake of Swans, some pearls Of magic he had brought with himâshe fledâ And from that fatal hour was never seen! The Chief of Cuscovilla's Vale returned. The Flower of Cuscovilla's Vale was gone! He visited the Fountain of Green Isles Thinking that she was drownedâbut she was notâ And when he prayed to Micabou, the God Of Nature, to restore him back his child, He said, the Wakon-bird had killed his dove, And borne her spirit to the Land of Souls! And he who talked like Outalissa's friend, Mustered his mighty host upon the hills, And laid the tall heads of our Warriors low! Just so has âJulianâ with Celuta's love! Now, Sachems! Warriours! listen to my voice: Before three Moons shall roll around in Heaven, The snorting War horse will be see upon This Isle trampling the Desert Flowers to dust! Before, Manito, who now rules above, This Conchaâshell shall be the only sign Of what I wishâthat he shall die tonight! (He dashes the Concha-shell down on the ground, and resumes his seat amid shouts of applause). Ensenore (rising as before) A thousand years had rolled round the Oak, And it was still the Monarch of the Woods. It lifted its green head above the storms, And braved the lightning's flashâthe thunder's roar! The Whirlwinds played among its cloudy moss, Little Endea fondling with the locks of Love. I sat beneath its shadow in my youth When manhood's sorrow was not in my soul! The golden birds were singing in the boughs! I saw a little vine spring from its root, And gently raise itself from bough to bough. The old Oak seemed to love it as his child. A hundred Moons had passed away in Heaven. I saw that Oak again. But it was changed. Its limbs began to die!âIts leaves were dead! Autumn had come before its time! It seemed To hang its stately glory out to die! The little vine, that had been weaker than The Fawn, was now the Monarch of the woods! It twisted its insidious folds around That tree, until it prest the life blood from Its mighty heart! I watched the serpent vine, And, as it hugged its Monarch with deceit I took my tomahawk and cut it loose! The old Oak lived! It stood again beneath The thunderclouds of Heaven the same; and now It wears the greeness of enduring youth! I cannot speak the White Man's speech. I speak Not with my tongue. I have no music in My soul. I speak the language of my heart. The Red Man is the Oak; the White Man is The Vine! Lamorah (raising sad face) Great Ensenore has spoken truth Will not a drop of water taste so sweet To one born blind as unto one who sees? But if the White Man give him gall to drink, Will that taste sweet as honey from my hands? Oh, that the White Man had the Red Man's eyes! The blood that fills Lamorah's veins is just As dear to him as blood to other men. I feel the same thing that the White Man feels. I eat, sleep, live, love, hateâand have to die! The children that I love are just as dear. And yet the White Man does not think it so. He acts as though all things were made for himâ The Heavens, the Earthâeven Hell itself were hisâ And no one lived upon the land but him! Oh! that the White Man had the Red Man's eyes! (Enter Ianthe running to Count Julian's arms.) Ianthe Oh! Julian! Julian! Are you here? But why? Why are you here? What is the matter now? What have you done? Why are these people here? It cannot be that you are bound? Oh! God! I have forebodings of what they will do! Why are these people waiting here? Oh speak! Count Julian While I was sitting in our Bower todayâ Reading the Sacred Oracles of Oldâ Thinking no evilâfearing none from Abanâ Ten cowards came with colored Ostenee, And rushing on me, made me fast in chains. And bore me, captive, to this place you see. At which they celebrate their father's deeds, And no doubt wish to banquet on my soul. But fools! they are as ignorant as dirt! They know not of the Mighty Power's love! The body they may killâbut not the soul! Ianthe Oh! Julian! Julian! then you have to die! Hope not from them! They came to take your life! How can you be so calm? Oh! cruel Fate! A few short hours ago we were in blissâ Now Sorrow treads upon the heels of Joy! Why did you not stay with me in the cave? Had you been there, you would not now be here! Our Bower of Bliss is changed to one of wo! Oh! God! it cannot be that you must die! To die for what? What have you done? What crime Have you committed, that you have to die? Count Julian This serpent-armor which now panoplies These brazen Fiends from head to heel, which they Believe make them invulnerable, I will Inpierce with Truth's bright arrows left in Heaven And make them vulnerable as Turtle Doves. Ianthe (approaching and kneeling before Lamorah) Oh! good Lamorah! father! you can tellâ Why is my Julian doomed to die? Save! save! Here, at your feetâhere, will I kneel till death, Until I hear you say that he shall live! What has he done that he is doomed to die? He would not injure youânow any one! He is as free from guilt as Heaven from Sin! Then tell me, father! what has Julian done? Oh! tell me, why is he condemned to die? Lamorah (rising) Well, I will tell you why he has to die. It is the custom with our Tribe that when A White Man has deceived us, he must die! We have not cut the Roebuck on his thigh, That he should make himself like one of us. Besides, he has deceived me to my face, And he tho puny pale-face all the while! For this he has to die! Hear you his doom? Ianthe But you had done the same, had you been in His place. This your Canondah knows right well. It was his own Celuta brought him here! Who is to him what she is now to you! When she was taken captive by the Whites, Did you not rescue her at dead of night? You know you did, for she has told me so. You jeopurdid your own to save her life, Because it was more dear to you than yours! Must Julian die for what you would have done? This is unnaturalâunjustâunwiseâ A sin that good Lamorah cannot do. He who would set his captives free in peace, Will not in peace, make captive one to die! No, good Lamorah cannot do this sin! Lamorah A full blood Indian never changed his mind, So, put they one hand into both of mine, And take back to your âJulianâ a broken heart And tell him that the streams run down the hills. (Ianthe rises, returns to Julian, and hiding her face in his bosom, weeps.) Count Julian Look up, Ianthe! do not weep, my love! The Moon shines brightest in the darkest night. It nearly kills me thus to see you weep! It hurts me more than any fear of death! Look up, that I may look down in thine eyesâ Two crystalline wells of love reflecting Heavenâ And drink delight out of their soul-lit depths! For they are beautiful to me tonight As any other eyes could be by day. Think you that if I were now doomed to dieâ To be burnt up by faggots at this stakeâ That you could brave the element of fire And, like the Hindoo woman on the pyre Of the dead husband, die with me? Ianthe Ay, that I couldâbrave all the elements Of Heavenâwhich I will do to die with thee! Should they condemn thee unto death tonight, Which I believe they willânay, know they willâ I cannot live! for I would rather die A death by fire, than live a living death Without thy more than, precious heavenly love! For, like the Palm trees, we can only live By growing side by sideâapartâwe die! Count Julian (very affectionately) My Dian-luta! Hebe of my heart! Pale, saintly Lily from the Bowers of God! How you do make me hate the thoughts of death! Thy very being makes me long to live. (Enter Endea) Endea What! Sachems! Warriours! Virgins! are you here! Lamorah! thou are calling down upon Thy head the wrath of Him who never sleeps! What! know you not that if you wound the Swan That she will stain the waters with her blood? So, if you touch one hair upon his head, The Seminolian falls to rise no more! A Dream came to me in my sleep last night, And showed me many things to come to pass! How Manito walking on thick clouds In steps of thunder! Death was in his eyes And as he passed, he seemed to say to me, The little light that shines upon you now, Will roll out fifty times through Heaven, when all In Quttalaerockee's Vale shall pass away! (Endea falls upon the earth like stone. Ostenee rushes up and bears her out.) Lamorah (rising as before) Rejoice, Celuta, he shall die tonight! Warriours! prepare the faggots for the fire! And he who sang so sweetly in the Bower, May now begin his own Death-song! Prepare! (The warriours begin to pile the wood around his form.) Ianthe What! Warriours! have you lost your souls? Why do ye tarry here? have ye no thought That it is Banqueting of Souls tonightâ On which ye cannot sentence Man to death? Look to your wivesâyour childrenâto your homesâ For lo! the Seminolian's hour is nigh! Ensenore (rising as before) Great Chief! It is most trueâwe have no right To sentence any Man to death upon The Sacred Night of Banqueting of Souls! It is against our customâcannot be! Lamorah (rising as before) What, has it come to this? no law? no right? Shall he who braved the elements of Heavenâ Who lived for forty summers in the storms, And passed as many Winters in the wasteâ Who kissed the footsteps of his Mighty God Walking upon the midnight storm unscaredâ Suffer the puny pale-face to be lord Above his children, while the Slave, who sings His Cornsong, walks upon his father's bones? No! never shall the Indian come to this, While this proud heart within my bosom beats, And knows that it is old Lamorah's heart! Ensenore (rising as before) You know, great General! that we have no law By which to sentence any man to death Upon the Night of Banqueting of Souls! It is against our customâcannot be! Our fathers never had nor can we have. But that we may not differ in this thing, Let all our votes be takenâthose who love His life, vote for his lifeâWho loves his death, Vote for his death. Lamorah (rising as before) Agreed. It shall be done. Those for his death be blackâfor life be white. If more be drawn of black than whiteâhe dies! If more of whiteâhe lives. Now let them vote Receive them in your crown, great Ensenoreâ The Warriours voting firstâthe Virgins last. (They vote, while the Virgins chant, in a wildly plaintive strain, the following supplication for his soul). Supplication Father! we cry to thee! Because thou hast the power To set this captive free, And save him from this hour! He who could make the sun, And fill the stars with light, Can save this sinless one From being burnt tonight! We ask for this young Dove The boon her heart doth crave, Who bleeds for her true loveâ Then save him, Father! save! If not for his deserts, Then for Celuta's sake Melt these dark iron hearts, Or else her own must break! Send from the Heavens above Some Angel full of might, That he may give this Dove Her own true love tonight! Repeat: We ask for this young Dove, etc. Let the foul Tyrant know He cannot triumph long, When Truth becomes his foeâ For Right will conquer Wrong! Hear, Lord! our humble prayer, Played for this gentle Dove, Who waits, in her despair, Some answer from above! Repeat: We ask for this young Dove, etc. Untie his tender handsâ Let the young captive freeâ And bind in iron bands The souls that rail at Thee! Oh! calm her anxious fears, And lift her from the sod; For sure an orphan's tears Can melt the heart of God! Repeat: We ask for this young Dove, etc. Ensenore There is an equal number of both kindsâ The Virgins having voted for his life; Nor is there any one to turn the scale, Save Endea, who was taken out for dead! Ianthe Yes, good Lamorah! let poor Endea voteâ Lean to the side of Mercyâlet her vote! Lamorah (rising as before) Talk not to me of Mercy now! Away! Ianthe No, by the right which I have now to speakâ Born of these very votesâI tell you, Man! You cannot take his life upon a tie! So, let him go, Lamorah! Let him go! He that's not condemned is free to go! Lamorah (rising as before) No; though not sentenced, yet he is not free. He has Yanassa's garb upon his back. How came he by that robe? Who pulled it off! When did he take it off? Not in this life! Therefore, he must have done it after death! He is the murderer of Yanassa then! A murderer cannot live! So, he must die! Bring forth Yanassaâthen he shall be free! I give him till tomorrow morn to tell. If, at that hour, he does not tellâhe dies!â Where is Yanassa? Julian! thou canst tell! Count Julian Lamorah! Where is Simighan? Lamorah In Hell! Esnah (rising, aside to Lamorah) Let icy words hang on thy lips, even while The fires of Hell do burn in thy heart! The Lion steps the softest just before He kills the Fawn! Then shake him by the hand And smile! The Day must pass! The Night will come! And this great Watchfire shall not blaze in vain! (Reenter Endea) Endea Talk not to me of love! Oh talk not so! What love was equal to mother's love? She who first pillowed me upon her breast, There, in three Desert Cones, among the flowers, Whence came the music of the soft-tongued Winds, To lull me into sweet repose! Alas! How my rapt soul could love her, did she live, Seeing it loves her so now she is dead! Count Julian Lamorah! look upon this orphaned girl! For say whose infant cradle once was made The Wind-locked branches of the flowery Beechâ Has missed father, motherânone but thee, And great Manito! Press her to thy heart, For Simighan is dead! Oh! generous Man! Whose hand was big enough to slay that Man? Lamorah (rising as before) My father slew him! Outalissa! son Of Miscou! Chief in Cuscovilla's Vale, Where rolls the mighty river of Mobileâ For so Areskou willed it from above! Count Julian Yes! Outalissa killed poor Simighan! But what were his last dying words to me? TheseââSave my Endea from the savage foe, And, after she is saved, revenge my death!â So, last night, his blest soul came down to me, And in the voice of the departed said, âRemember Julian! to avenge my death! The faithless shall receive no joy in Heaven! And for my Endea's sakeâmy dear lost child! Let vengeance fall upon Lamorah's head!â By all the ties that bind me to this world! By all the ties that bind me to the dead! I swore to sacrifice my life to her! Lamorah What! taunt me with the curse of one in Hell? That base Castillian from the land of Spain Who stole my sister from the Lake of Pearlsâ The fairest flower in Cuscovilla's Valeâ Now, he dares come to haunt me from the graveâ Coming to seekâOutalissa's son! Pile up the faggots that the dog may burnâ For when the Chickaconee comes to sound The Banqueting of Souls thou shalt behold Thy brother Simighan in Hell!âPrepare! Endea Yes! when the Chickaconee comes to sound The Banqueting of Souls thou shalt behold God's golden Angel coming down from Heaven To take revenge upon you all! Prepare! Lamorah Talk not to me of Mercy now! Away Base traitor! thou hast spoken of my father But if the tribe of old Lamorah falls, The Boy, that made you tell me so, shalt die! Prepare! she is the bride of Ostenee! Ostenee (approaching Endea) Sweet Endea! thou hast heard my father's voice? Endea What of his mercy? What said he of the Chase? Ostenee The Chaseâthe War Danceâboth are over now. The Banqueting of Souls will soon beginâ When Julian's soul will go above the stars! Endea Whence thine will never go! Ostenee Thou didst not hear? Lamorah says thou art the Forest Beacon. Endea Who did he say should have this Forest Beacon? Ostenee The EagleâOsteneeâLamorah's son. Thou art my sisterâplaymate of my heartâ Who made my first tracks in the sand with me. Thou shalt remember in an evil hour, When the lank wolf was howling on the shore, That being overtaken by the Night, Wandering alone amid the Desert Caves, Where long reed blades made music in the winds, Responsive to the Wolf's obstreperous howlâ A furious Tiger, maddened by the Chase, Grinned horribly in thy love-beaming eyes, And, crouching closely to the earth, had torn Thy lovely form in pieces, had this arm Not laid him helpless, bleeding at thy feet! Endea I recollect I broke your eggs this mornâ Lying beside the threshhold of my doorâ Spurning them with my foot into the dust! I told you then, I hated you as sin! And, now I tell you that I hate you more! So, never pester me again! Go, mope About through all this Isle, until the hour Arrives when you shall be swept from earth! But I am sorry that I broke your eggsâ Not for the owner's sakeâbut for the eggsâ For I have always loved the Wood Dove wild, And would not harm her egglings for the world! Lamorah Where is Yanassa? Tell me where he is! Count Julian (insultingly) I am Yanassa from the Land of Souls! Lamorah Where is my son? how came you by his garb? Count Julian I am Yanassa wearing my own garb! Lamorah (in great rage) Pile up the faggots for his speedy death! The villian shall not live on this Isle. Prepare! (The Warriours pile up the faggots around his form.) Ianthe (sighing to him) Tell him, dear Julian! tell him where he is! If you do know, oh! tell him where he is! But if you do not know, what will be done? You cannot lie! see how they bring the wood Piling it round your precious form to burn You up in ashes! Oh! my God! my God! And still you seem regardless of your fate! What! are you so eager to go with ugly Death? That life is lovelessâhateful to your rights! You say that your Celuta is your lifeâ Will you destroy your life by your own death? Oh! my dear Julian! let me bring your Harp! Playâsingâthey cannot kill you if you sing! And I will sing with your our Hymns to God, And that great Resurrection Hymn of yours, In which you speak so sweetly of our Lordâ How he was glorified, not on the Mount, But at the Tomb of Joseph when He rose! And that sweet heavenly Hymn, so soft, sweet, Built on the dying words of ChristââI thirst!â You sang in our great Temple in the Caveâ The Church of AdonaiâHouse of Godâ There nights ago, to hear your golden voice Roll through the labyrinthine aisles afar, The caverns echoingâstill rich and longâ Long after you had ceased to utter songâ Are hearing nowâwill ever who hearsâ Perpetuating still the heavenly strainsâ Because God will not let his praises die! Oh! my dear Julian, let me bring your harp And we will sing the songs that we love best, And pray to God that he may love them too, And they shall be our life songsânot our death! What say you, Julian? Shall I bring your harp? Count Julian They would not understand us should we sing. Ianthe Oh! yes they will. They cannot help but hear; And, hearing, cannot help but melt to tears; And, melting into tears, they cannot kill! For music is the language of the skies, The eloquence of Heaven's High Seraphims; The golden tongue by which they talk to Godâ The silver chain that binds us unto Heaven! Count Julian My harp! bring it my dearest love, Binding my raptured soul in golden chains! Ianthe But they will kill you ere I come again! Behold! Behold! the Avenging Angel comes! The Angel of poor Endea's dream! He comes! he comes! To sweep these sinners clear from the earth! The bright Aerial Car, vermillion toned Like that in which Elijah rode to God, High in the zenith, right above this Isle, Is now descending through Heaven's Ether-sea, Resplendentâglorious as the setting sunâ Or, like the Moon, ful-faced, just rising up; Or, like the Morning Star, let down from Heaven By Angels' hands! Lamorah (as if thunderstruck) He comes! he comes! look up! Look there! Ensenore Fly, Warriours! fly! fly for your lives! (They all fly in utter confusion, leaving the Ten Fair Virgins, dumb with astonishment, clinging around Count Julian for protection, as the Aerial Car descends upon the Island near them. Ianthe unbinds Count Julian and embraces him with joy). Endea (lifting up her hands) Thank God! thank God! now I can die in peace! Curtain falls End of Act Fourth Act V Scene I (The interior of Lamorah's cottage. Count Julian, Ianthe, and the Ten Fair Virgins are examining the riches that he has left behind him). Count Julian These, too, are onesâthe richest costliest furs, Of infinite variety of hue, From milky white to lustrous glossy blackâ All damasked with the down of forest Birds. Richer than those bright Birds of Paradise, Which, at the Nutmeg Season, fly away To fruitful India from the Summer Islesâ More gorgeous than those radiant, feathered skins Brought from the Guinea Isles to the Malays; Some golden-plumaged in the Tropics dyedâ Others with paler hues dyed in the Northâ All intermingled with Mosaic Wordsâ The life-time work of old Canondah's hands After Lamorah had prepared the skins. This did he with some simple Art unknown To any but himselfâborn to die With him. Ianthe But here are other untold gemsâ Great chests of purest Virgin Goldâ The richest Plate that ever eyes beheldâ Which, from the Names, engraved upon each one, Show that they were not wrought by Savage hands, But are the wealth of Spanish Kings, brought by The Spanish Buccaneers, in days gone byâ The Pirates of the Southern Seasâin Ships To Florida, in Saint Louis' Fort, (The Spanish Coffer of Freebooter's wealthâ) They long remained amassed, with Precious Stones, Until the Savage Myrmadons came down, In one great human deluge from the North, Slaughtering them so they were compelled to fly Leaving these riches in the Indians' hands! Great Outalissa, son of Miscou, Chief In Cuscovilla's Valley near the seaâ Was Wood-born Sythean of this mighty host, Who claimed the treasures as his own. So, when He died, these fell into Lamorah's hands. Count Julian Come, my Celuta! bring the Virgins Ten, And let us gaze on this rich Barque of Heavenâ The Angel of such terrorâsuch delightâ So beautifulâbeyond compareâthe work Of Angels' hands, although not made in Heaven. (Exeunt omnes). Scene II (The Lake of Swans in the background. The Beautiful Car is discovered lying on the shore. Enter Count Julian, Ianthe, and the Virgin Ten). Count Julian This car, of Swan-like shape or Crescent Moon, Was sent by some great Artisan who knew Well how to fashion things of beauteous shape Out of the strongest, yet the softest, woodâ Susceptible of polish fine as glass; For on its varnished sides we can behold Our faces mirrored back most perfectly Each, so being represented with Designs Originalâmost beautifulâthe work Of some genius too, done in purest gold. On this side is this beautiful Design; Eros with Psyche in delusion. Here, on this other side, is this Design; Earth pointing Virtue out the way to Heaven. Bands of attendant Angels hovering nigh. Within the center of the Car, there is A large, diaphanous hollow globe of glass, Rich, crimson-tinged, whirling snow burns into light. Bright as the noonday sun, pure, vital gas, Which gives such Moon-like splendor to the globe. This was the play thing of some Prince or King! Let loose in some far distant land to flyâ Wafted by God's own breath at this dread hour, Like an Avenging Angel to destroy, Bringing glad tidings of great joy to those Who had been so rebuked in inocenceâ Who were God's chosen People, because pure. Come, let us launch it on the Lake of Swans. Evora, queen of all the Virgin Ten, She, being mistress of the light Canoe At home upon the Fountain of Green Isles, Where she is called the Queen of Micabouâ Shall make the first voyage in the queenly Barque. Thus shall Celuta sail out every day, Wafted in joyful dalliance to the port Of odorous breezes coming through the Isle, Shaded at noontime by the Princely Palms Must canopy the margent of the Lake, With verdant twilight soothing to the soul. (They launch the bark upon the lake). Now let us go into the Bower of Bliss And seek fair Endea, Prophetess of life. The Ten Fair Virgins are our captives nowâ Sweet Wood-Nymphs of this Dian of the Isle! Their task is now to minister delight To you in every possible way they can. To gather Roses daily in the Bower, To make the Atar-Gul for your perfumes, (Wherewith you are to bathe your lily limbs;) Attend the cygnets in the Valley Reeds; Gather the Swans' eggs laid upon the Isle; Make Cymars for themselves of down of Swans, And Mantilletts of dappled skins of Fawns, Damasked with prismy down of Humming birds, Of multicoloured dyes, caught in the Bower; To fabricate rich articles of dress, Such as would be an ornament to queensâ Which only queens could buy, (for they are freeâ And everything that is theirsânot slaves'â) Which duties, when imposed, shall be to them Like loading the purer air with Atar-Gul From out the Bowers of Heaven. Ianthe How glad I am That all this Islandâall this wealth is yours! Count Julian But yet t'is like poverty to me Compared with that inestimable wealth Shrined in the Casket of Celuta's heartâ (My soul's incarnate Heavenâ) pure, virtuous loveâ Come let us seek fair Endea in the Bower. (Exeunt omnes). Scene III (The Bower of Bliss. Endea is discovered lying on Count Julian's couch asleep. Enter Count Julian, Ianthe, and the Virgin Ten). Count Julian See how her lily-form lies on my couch, Beneath the healing drugs of balmy sleep, All odorous with the aeros divine of loveâ Breathing out fragrance from her lips of rose, Which makes the place as cloudy with perfume As if Celestial Roses filled the Bowerâ So softly, meekly, melancholy pale, She seems an Angel newly made for Heaven! Loveâunrequited loveâis killing her! Ianthe Ah! nothing earthly yet was ever known To last, except the changeable in change, Which is the everlasting round of things! She is the cloud upon our Heaven of bliss! At first, it was not larger than her hand; But now, like Ahab's, it makes dark the sun! Count Julian Far as the autumn trees drop leaves of goldâ The frail Mimosa withers at our nightâ So sheds she from her soul all hopes of joy, But in the World to Comeâwhere she shall hear The Choral SymphoniesâGodâloving Psalmsâ In Cherubimical outpourings burst From Angel's lips of fire, singing aloud In myriad Choir of mightiest Songs, The sweet Evangels of Celestial love. Endea (waking) Oh! Julian! had you loved Celuta less, And Endea moreâshe had not died so soon! For when we lose our precious Heaven on earth What other world have we to lose but Heaven? I tell you, I have lost my Heaven on earth! And, without this, how can my body live? My body cannot live without this Heaven! You see it fadingâfading day by day! Still growing nearer to the grave each hour! Growing each hour more reconciled to death! For, as the full-robed Moon now wanes in Heaven, But only to be made the same sweet Moon; So, in the Eternal Cycles, shall my soul Revolve upon itself, forever fullâ Forever growing to be fuller stillâ But never getting full of boundless bliss. Soon I shall drink of that Lethean Stream. Which rolls in silence through the Vale of Deathâ (The only Fountain of Perpetual Youth Unto the goodâof death to all the bad). Which Ponce de Leon sought on earth through life, And never found till deathâwhich all must findâ Then will my sorrows here on earth find rest! Oh! Julian! put your hand upon my heart! Feel how it beats! My life is ebbing fast! It beats too fast for me to live an hour! Oh! Julian! I have died before my time! But as my body faints my soul grows strong Eating the fruit of that Igdrasil Whose roots are anchored in the depths of Hell! But whose great gorgeous boughs reach up to Heaven Spreading umbrageously among the Stars Bending with Golden FruitâAmbrosial Fruitâ Such as the Angels feed on in the skies Watered by that crystalline well of Heaven, Called Miner, flowing from the Throne of Godâ Which is so precious to the human soul, That he who eats thereof shall never die! Count Julian This tree is watered by their great Times, Called Norms, Giants of Eternity! Whose Names on forth are Present, Future, Pastâ To whom the power is given to comprehend All thingsâto conquer all things under Heavenâ Whose task it is to guard this Tree of Life From Sin's great axeâthe slave of Deathâwho strives To cut it down that with its ponderous crash It may destroy the World! Endea God grant they may! For like the blinded Nightingale that sings All day, thinking that it is the nightâall night, Not knowing that it is not the dayâbecause His eyes are outâmaking one live-long night Of all his lifeâone endless song of all This night!âlifting his soulâuplifting song Out of this world into the faroff skies, Where God now sits on his sapphire throne, Arrayed in robes of lightning-fire, above Th' Empyreal thunder-roll, listening to hear The Angels pour their rivers of deep song Down through Heaven's Aromatic Ether Sea, Honoring the spheric symphony of starsâ In rapturous unionâso is my soul Burthened with sorrow in this Vale of Tearsâ Doomed in Grief's night forever more to pineâ Mourning in strains, that instead ring in Heaven, For days that are denied me here on earth! He, if the blinded nightingale could see, He would not sing by day, but in the nightâ Making an endless night of all his lifeâ Through which he sings forever more his griefâ (Coevalâcoeternal with his nightâ) Until, like my poor soul, he sings his way Out of this world into the far off skies! For now the seals are taken from mine eyesâ Couched now to see unutterable things! Mine eyes are opened to the blissful sounds Of Angels' songs, sung up in glory now! The rapturous melodies of ransomed souls Singing in concert with the Seraphims! I feel as if I were all spirit now! And though, upon thy breast, were still in Heaven! For when shall I see Heaven so dear to me? Oh! come in deathâthe death that I now dieâ Is it not more than Heaven to be with this? Hereâhereâwhere I could lie forever more! Oh! Julian! hear me nowâWhen I am deadâ A Willow tree cut down by Death's cold axe! Your poor, dear Endea, dying for your love! Cold, lying in the casket of the grave! Let not the Tree of Memory perish to; But keep its roots, now growing in your heart, Watered with Pity's everlasting tears! Hope shall not perish in the grave, but grow, Immortal as the soul itself, in Heaven! Count Julian The Tree of Memory doth defy the grave, It is so firmly rooted in my soul, That, if Death's icy axe should cut it down, Out of its deathless roots would spring Another Tree whose boughs should reach to Heavenâ Bearing Ambrosial Fruitâthe nectared food Of Angelsâmightier than that Mighty Tree The Chaldean saw in Visions of the night! ENDEA Plant thou th' immortal Myrtle on graveâ The emblem of the soul that cannot dieâ To image how you love Celuta now! I see Faith pointing me the way to Heaven, Drest in white robes, as white as her own soulâ Bands of Attending Angels hovering nigh! While yonder come True Minstrels of Peace, All flying, arm in arm, from out of Heaven To take me home to GodâNow I must die! Raise up my head, dear Julian! let me die Upon your breast! Thereâbold me so awhile! This bosom could have saved me from the grave! But then it might have sent Celuta there! And it would rather send me there than her! Soft couch on which my head could ever rest Softer than any that Celuta makesâ Or ever madeâor ever will be made! How strong your heart beats! tolling in your breast, The knell of your destinyâof mine! For every life-pulse brings you nearer Godâ And, therefore, nearer unto me in Heaven! For I shall soon be coldâcold in the grave! Hereâlay your hand upon mine nowâweak weak! Does it not weakly toll the death of Hope! Oh! my Celuta! be not jealous now, To see me lying on his precious breast! It is not done to win him from your heartâ I lay me here to die! Here, let me lieâ Pillowed upon his breastâclose by his heartâ Until it rocks me into endless rest! The only time I was taken sick, That I have felt the least desire to liveâ For soon it will be pillowed in the grave! He cannot love me nowânot loving me In life, he will not love me after death! Who loves the living cannot love the dead! Give me some waterâcool my parching lips! For they are dry with icy death! Oh! God! I see my mother at the Gates of Heaven! Is she not waiting there for me? I know She isâdrest in rich robes of lightning-fire! Oh! how she shines! calling me home to God! Saying, âCome home, my wounded Dove! come home! For who can pull that arrow from thy heart, But God? Come home to thine celestial rest!â And now, dear Julian! I must die! Farewell! (She dies). Count Julian Oh! God! Celuta! look here! look here, love! Poor Endea faints! give me some waterâquick! For she is dying! Give the cup to me! Hold up her head! hold up her precious head! My God! she cannot drink! her eyes are set! See how they quiver in her head! how bright! How more than bright! filled with the light of Heaven! Celuta She breathes! Count Julian No, it was one long easeful sigh Breathed outâ(the last that she will ever breatheâ) To ease her dying heart weighed down by grief! Celuta Yesâshe is dead! How beautiful in death! Ten thousand times more beautiful than life! How placidâhow sereneâhere countenance! As if her spirit, now in heaven, were here! As if Heaven's body there were lying here! Count Julian See how the clammy sweat beads her pale brow, Like dewdrops on some withered lily leafâ By Death's new baptism sealed to endless life! Pale purple tinging her pure fingers' endsâ Smiting the roseate from its proper placeâ The lily-pale usurping of the Rose! My God! have we not seen an Angel die? Does she not look as if she were in Heaven? I never knew before how bright one's eyes Could look in death! This is enough to make Us all in love with Deathâdesire to die! All Mysteryâall Pityâall deep Loveâ Divinest in the soul of Manâcome here, And gaze, with mutual awe, most eloquentâmost muteâ And let your hearts break over her in grief! What calmness rests upon her peaceful brow! What meeknessâpityâon her precious lips! How mutely eloquentâhow loudly mute! Filling in silence more than tongue can tell! Heaven's Halo radiant round her peaceful brow! Celuta This is the place where she beheld you firstâ The place whereon she said she wished to die! Here where she lies, shrined in her milkd-white shroud, Fair as the crescent Moon, supine in Heaven, Half hidden by her own self-silvered cloudsâ Sweet, saintly image of her soul in Heaven! Fragrant with flowers that blossomed when she died! The Ten Fair Virgins gather round to weepâ Weeping aloudâ(for they know how to weep!) For like the falling of pure snow on earth, Were her last dying words to us aroundâ We saw her lips move, but we heard no sound! Count Julian For in the Temple of her virgin formâ God's holy Templeâfull of holiest thoughtsâ Her soul dwelt like an Angel dwells in Heaven; Looking abroad upon the world, with eyes Dewy with Pity's pensive tenderness! Pale, saintly lily not yet opened quite, Whose fragrance still lies folded in the bud, Troubled by the amorous World all leave With Pity's tearsâlives that must evil flowâ That beauty such as hers must ever dieâ Plucked in its freshness by the hands of Death! Ianthe Far as the twilight sinks into the arms Of Night, losing itself in the embraceâ Both blending into oneâall darkly stillâ Leaving the World in darknessâtill the Moon, Fullfaced, rising in Heaven, rains down her beams, And Night is overflowedâso did she sinkâ Paleâsoftly silentâin the arms of Deathâ Leaving the friends who mourn for her aloneâ God's blissful glory bursting on her soul! Count Julian Come, my Celuta! wipe away your tears! This sorrow is too much! (It hurts me so To see you weep, I cannot help but weep!) Thawing away our heart in fruitless tearsâ Although it is our instinct thus to weepâ (For weeping will not bring her back againâ) But teach our disposition more to weep; For Sorrow is our teacher how to mourn! Come, my Celuta, wipe those violet-eyes, Too much bedewed with Sorrow's thawâand let Us sing an Elegy upon her deathâ Pouring our souls away in song, not tearsâ Until we gladden her pure soul in Heaven! Ianthe Write you the Elegy. Give me the harp; And then accompany me with your sweet voice, While in sweet alternations of deep grief, I shake melodious music from the strings, Singing with my own voice in unison. Now, my dear Julian, write the Elegyâ Write it with your heart's blood upon your hand, While beside her, while she lies in death, With eyes swimming with unshed tearsâ Calling it after her sweet name in Heaven, Where she now dwellsâthe lily-bell of Love. Requiem Now the Voyager has landed From th' Eternal Lightâsea deep, While her body here has stranded In the grave no more to weep! (chorus of Angels) No more to weep! God-inspired she heard the silence Of the Angels' voices say, In the bright Empyreal Islands Of the starsââLove! come away!â (chorus of Angels) Love! come away! To the Pure Earth of the Angels, Sought by PlatoâBlest Abode! Where the Spheres' Divine Evangels Wash against the feet of God! (chorus of Angels) The feet of God! Count Julian Now as she lies here shrouded in purest white, So let us lift her on her Swan-down bier, And bear her softly to the Cave, where in A Vault made by the hands of Godânot Menâ Upon a marble slab of Tablet height, There let us lay her out again to restâ Where, with these Virgin Ten to help, you can Embalm her body with the Oil of Rose, Till, by the Alchemy of your fair hands, She may become transmuted into life. Then after kissing her, strew her again With flowersâthe ones that blossomed when she died! (Exeunt omnes, bearing her out. Reenter Count Julian. He sings to his harp. Count Julian (singing) What is it that makes the maiden So like Christ in Heaven above? Or, like heavenly Eve in Aiden Meeting Adam blushing?âloveâ Love, love, love! What is it that makes the murmur Of the plaintive Turtle Dove Fill our hearts with so much Summer Till they melt to passion?âloveâ Love, love, love! Nothing else but love! See the Rose unfold her bosom To the amorous Sun aboveâ Bursting into fragrant blossom At his sightâwhat is it?âloveâ Love, love, love! All the Christian Constellations Choiring through the realms above, Soon would cease their ministrations, Were it not for thee, oh, love! Love, love, love! (Exit Count Julian) Scene IV (The interior of the Cave. Ianthe and the Virgin Ten are discovered kneeling before the flower-strewn body of Endea. Enter Count Julian). Ianthe (rising and embracing Julian) Oh! Julian! Julian! never wonder more! In reverential awe bow down before This faired image of the Lamb of God! For, oh! the change! the change! the wondrous change! Count Julian Have you embalmed her faired form? Ianthe We haveâ And strewn her corse with flowersâbut, oh, the change! Her form has changed from perishable flesh To rich, immortal marbleâParian-pure! Count Julian Does she retain the outlines of her form? Ianthe In all its pure Angelic lovelinessâ The oval contour of her lily limbsâ Her Angel-fore, just as we laid her outâ Her fingers perfect, clasped upon her breastâ Her every part, still virgin, all entireâ Fixed to the marble slab on which she lies, As fresh as if just sculptured from the rockâ A perfect Proxitelian Dream of all That is most meek, most gentle, most Divine The rich embodiment of all your Dreams Of Infinite Perfection, when most rapt, Of Beauty sleeping in the Arms of Peace! Come, gaze upon her with your own pure eyes, And lay your hand upon her brow And judge then for yourself! Count Julian It is most true! And not less wonderful than true! This is The Climax of all wonders ever known! So perfect is the transmutation hereâ Done by the Alchemy of God in Heavenâ The integration of her flesh by stoneâ By which the molecules have places changed. This model sculptureâmodeled out the stone That we could not fashion it with our eyes Did we not lay our hands upon her form And by two lofty senses prove its time! Now, so hither it was Grief that did all this, Or the intenseness of her deathless love, That so could send her spirits up to God And stamp Eternity upon her formâ As Niobe was changed to living stone By her great grief for her dear children's lossâ Smitten by Great Apollo's golden bowâ Pouring his arrows on their heads from Heaven. While from her eyes eddy everlasting tearsâ T' is never than I, or any man, can tell For what we hear about her being changed To stone by her unending grief for Thebesâ Is not all fableâbut eternal fact! Suffice it that she lies eternal hereâ Coeternal with her beauty is the bloom Her soul now wears beside God's throne in Heaven There to perpetuate her virtues here. And begins the living the reward, That God was always apt to store for those who love, And loving dies by love, rather than sin For here she lies in her immortal state, As living sculpture written in pure stone, Revealing in meetest wonder, of the Good, The Innocent, the Beautiful, the Pureâ For her terrestrial was celestial Life; Everlastingly filled with too much light from Heavenâ That when she died, she died as Christians die, Full of the radiant hope of endless rest.

Selma (solo) The Sun is setting in the far-off West; I see him beckoning to the watchful Stars That make the heraldry of fulgent Heaven, While on the confines of celestial space They softly tread the downy couch of Eveâ Like fiery Cherubim all night, in love, Watching this lower world with eyes of fire. Enter Col. Thompson Col. Thompson Well, Stranger, Sachem, Priest! what is thy wish? Selma My soul was lifted half way up to Heaven! Col. Thompson Thy words betray uncommon mind. Speak on.

Priest on Coosa's banks, From Oostanallee to the Chestatee, Where Talapoosa rolls her mountain rills, From old Alchota's Holy Land above, To Ouithlacoochee's silver vale below. Col. Thompson Thy dress bespeaks some savage power. Art free? Selma I left my freedom with my enemies. Col. Thompson Ah! what misfortune rankles in thy soul? Selma A woman's infidelity. 'Tis true.

Remember that Naymoyah's soul is white! The gentle Fawn, that knows the Valley-paths, Will seek her Roe-buck on her native hills! Selma See how she flings her white arms round my neck, Till every thought swings blind with ecstasy, As if some Planet wandered from its sphere. To feed, with holier light, the Sun's eclipse!

Col. Thompson Who heads the Warriours in this vile revolt? Charley Emathla The bravest Tustenuggee of his Tribe; The Boy that looks so lofty as he walksâ Who speaks more by his actions than his wordsâ Says very little to the White-man's faceâ But hates him most the more he seems to love. Col. Thompson What! Osceola? Charley Emathla Yesâthe Rising Sunâ Who shakes the White-man's hand he hates the most. Col. Thompson But know you that the villian has been false, And that his treachery leads to open war? Charley Emathla I know that Osceola hates the whites, And that some white men have been killed by his. Col. Thompson Then shall the savage villian feel my power! Bring forth the Soldiers of the Guard! Come forth! (Enter Soldiers) Search the wild desert of the boundless woods, And bring me Osceolaâbring him chained! Then shall he learn the duty that he owes, The White-men who have always been his friends. (Exit Guard) Now, Charley, that the hostile Chiefs may know The duty that is due the White-man's law, I charge you, at the peril of your life, To summon him to Council in an hour. Charley Emathla It shall be done. Col. Thompson Away! it must be done (Exeunt) Scene III (Naymoyah is discovered sitting on a moss-covered rock in the desert weeping. Enter Ostenee). Ostenee (softly) Naymoyah! Naymoyah (rising) Ostenee! What of the Chase? Ostenee The Chase is over, but the Wardance has Begun. Naymoyah Who did the mighty chiefs decide Should have the Forest Queen? Ostenee Thou seest the manâ The EagleâSon of Miccanopyâhe Who loves thee better than he does his lifeâ Who grew up with thee in the forest cavesâ Making his first tracks in the sand with thee. Thou wilt remember, in an evil hour, When the lank wolf was howling on the coast, That, being overtaken by the Night, While wandering all alone amid the caves, Whose feathery blades made music in the winds, Responsive to the wolf's obstreperous howl, That, while terrific palsy shook thy soul, A furious Tiger, maddened by the Chase, Grinned horribly in thy love-beaming eyes, And, crouching closely to the earth, had torn Thy lovely form in pieces had not this arm Then laid him lifeless, bleeding at thy feet! Naymoyah So thou hast won the hand of this fair Queen? Ostenee I have. Naymoyah Then tell me who is this fair Queen? Ostenee The same that Ostenee saved from the paws Of that damned Tiger Naymoyah Ah! sayst thou so? Ostenee And all the mighty chiefs have said the same. Nor thy brave Ostenee, thy Warriour, comes To bend the knee that never bent before, And, bending now in vain, shall never bend Again! Naymoyah 'Tis true! Ostenee What! shall the lips that have been taught To utter nothing but the truth, scorn now The wisdom of the mightiest Chiefs? Naymoyah 'Tis said. Ostenee By Hell! the Pale-face who has taught thee this, To hate the Red-man soâshall not live long! Call back the bitter words, that thou hast said, Or, ere the sun shall set, his scalp shall be Entwined in clots of blood around thy neck! Call back the Words again! Naymoyah Peace! peace, young man! For thou art calling down upon thy head The wrath of Him who never sleepsâthe God Who rules Areskou easier than your power Can make Naymoyah what she would not be! All that is Indian in me thou mayst love. The White-man's partâthe part thou wouldst not haveâ Is all that makes Naymoyah what she is. Ostenee Oh! ye infernal scorpions of the Rocks! Ye poisonous Serpents of the crowned Hills! Crawl round the Eden of her heavenly limbs, And, as ye press the life-blood from her heart, Oh! sting her spirit, that ye scare away, With everlasting death! Naymoyah Begone, foul Fiend And never let me see thy face again! (Exit) Ostenee Go! get thee to the Council in an hour! For when the Chickaconee comes to sound The Banqueting of Souls, thou shalt behold The blazing fire round thy Selma's form, Bear off his Dove-like spirit to the stars! No! Ostenee can never let him live! (Exit) Scene IV (The Council House. Col. Thompson, the Head Man of the Agency, in his seat. Enter Charley Emathla, followed by the Chiefs of the Nation, who arrange themselves on the seats around the Agent. Enter Osceola chained, followed by the Guard). Col. Thompson Why is it that the Indian cannot live In comfort with the White-man near? The land He lives upon does not belong to him; But it was ceded to the Whites by Spain. Then why does Osceola thirst for blood? Why not now ratify the treaty made By Tuckasee Emathla, Chief of all The great men of the Nation, long ago? These questions shall be answered by the Chiefs Who raised this mutiny among his Tribe. Osceola (rising) What! shall this mighty spirit stoop to speak, As chainless as the freedom of the sea, And bound by mortal power? I will not speak! My hands are chained! Col. Thompson They areânor shall be loosed Until you sign the Treaty made at old Fort Gipson by the great men of your tribe. Miccanopy (rising) An hundred summers of perpetual peace have rolled in glory over Miccanopy's head, making his green heart flourish like the mighty Oak that ripens in the woods. An hundred Winters, too, have laid the green arms of the giant Oaks all bare. But never has the Seminolean seen a time like this! The Winter has returned again with tenfold violenceâThe Summer's Sun gone down in blood! The Roe-buck has been driven from the Hillsâthe white Swans from the silver Lakes. Who can now tell what Miccanopy's fate will be? Col. Thompson Will Osceola sign the Treaty now? Miccanopy (taking Osceola aside) Yes, sign it with your hand, but not your heart! (Aloud) Oh! yesâthe Treaty shall be signed! Col. Thompson Well said. Unchain his hands. The Talk may now go on. (The Soldiers unchain his hands) Now, Osceola, if you have one word To say, speak as the White-man's friend. Proceed. Osceola The hail of a thousand winters had fallen upon the Oak, but still it was the Monarch of the woods. It lifted up its mighty arms to Heaven, forgetful of the Lightning's blast, the Thunder's roar. The Storm had played among its cloudy moss, like Endea fondling with the locks of Love. I sat beneath its shadow in the green days of my youth, when there was no sorrow in my soul. The birds were singing in its boughs. I saw a little Vine spring from its root, and raise itself from bough to bough. The old Oak seemed to love it as his child. A hundred Moons had passed away in Heaven. I saw that Oak again. But it was changed. Its limbs began to wither. Its leaves were yellow. Autumn had come before its time. It seemed to hang its stately glory out to die. The little Vine, that had been weaker than the Fawn, was now the Monarch of the Woods. It twisted its insidious folds around that Tree, until it prest the life-blood its heart! I looked upon that Serpent-Vine hugging its Monarch with deceit, and took my Tommahawk and cut it loose. The old Oak lived. It stood among the thunderclouds of Heaven the same; and now it wears the greenness of eternal youth. I cannot speak the White-man's speech. I have no music in my soul. I speak the language of my heart. The Red-Man is the Oak. The White-man is the Vine. Jumper (rising) The Bee that has gathered honey from the lowland Honeysuckle knows where to find that tender flower again. But if that flower should be taken away, it would have to seek for honey among strange flowers. The same way with us. If we should go into a strange land, we should not know where to find our food. The milk of a thousand hills has nourished me from youth. The hills are the breasts of my mother, the Earth. If you take the child away from its mother, it will die. Col. Thompson Is Osceola reconciled to go? Osceola If my lips were to utter what my heart does not feel, the honor of my heart would give the utterance of my lips the lie. I am a Red-Man, but my soul is white. A drop of water to a blind man's lips will taste as sweet as to one who can see. But if the White-Man give him gall to drink, will that taste sweet as sweetness from the Red-Man's hands. Oh! Oh! that the White-Man had the Red-Man's eyes! The blood that fills my veins is just as red as any other blood. I feel the same things that the White-Man feels. I eat, live, love, and have to die. The air I breathe is just the same to me. The children that I love are just as dear. To be where they are nowâwhere they were bornâ is what I wish; but, if it cannot be, thenâ I can die! Miccanopy (taking Osceola aside) The Tommahawk, that has been buried now a hundred years, shall be dug up again from rusting underneath the Tree of Peace. Then, after it is polished of its rust, it shall be buried in the White-Man's heart! Col. Thompson Will Osceola sign the treaty now? Osceola Oh! yesâthe Treaty shall be signed. Col. Thompson Well said Then take the paperâlet him sign his name. (They take the paper, hand it to him to sign, when he takes his dagger from his belt and stabs it through). Osceola (exultingly) This is the way that Osceola signs his name! Col. Thompson The Council may be broken up. Tomorrow we shall meet again. Miccanopy (aside to Osceola) Now, as we part, look in his face and smile. The Lion steps the softest just before he kills the Fawn. Then shake him by the hand and smile. The Day must passâthe night will come. Remember what thy Chief has said. The Watchfire shall not blaze in vain! Osceola Let icy words hang on thy lips, even while the fires of Hell burn in thy heart! (Miccanopy, Osceola, and Jumper shake hands with the Agent, then quit the Council, followed by all the rest, except Charley Emathla and Selma). Col. Thompson Saw you the scorn that sat enthroned upon his brow, writhing in frowns like lightning in some thunder cloud? That look betrayed determination. Selma Decision sat enthroned upon his brow In awful dignity. Upon his lips A writhing scorn triumphant played, as if In concert with an agony within, That restless grew for something to devour. He is the Shadow of some mighty Godâ Nay, if the very Gods were on the earth, They would not look more like themselves, than is This Seminolean Chief! Behold! they come! (Violent yellings are heard from without. Reenter Osceola and Miccanopy with guns.) Osceola (to Col. Thompson) Rejoice! for thou shalt die tonight! The Dead came to me in their winding sheets, last night, and said, The Calumet of Peace is gone! The Tommahawk is now dug up again! Rise up, my Osceola! and avenge my wrongs! I rose. The pale face of my murdered friend stood at the door. Speak not! The door of Hell shall be unlocked! The White-man will not chain me then! The hands that thou didst chain a few short hours ago, shall drag thee to the Desert, where the Wolf shall fatten on thy carcass, and the hungry Vulture peck thine eyes! (Osceola and Miccanopy fire on Col. Thompson and Charley Emathla, as they retire to the back of the stage, and they fall). Miccanopy (stepping up to Selma) Ha! Miccanopy's boy. By yonder Big Light in the sky! thy soul shall dwell among the Stars tonight! Away! the Indian's Council shall decide thy fate! (Exit Miccanopy bearing off Selma) Osceola (walking up to Charley Emathla) Oh! thou dead Dog! who had the White-man's heart, but wore the Indian's garb! I will not stamp upon thee with my footâfor thou art on the White-man's earth! I will not honour thee with any thing but deathâand that thou hast! Thou art upon the cold earth now, that was not colder than thy heart! The Indian spurns thee as he would the faithless dog! (Waling up to Col. Thompson). But thou who hadst the Red-Man chainedâwho caged the mightiest Eagle ever born on earthâ I tread upon theeâcrush thee to the earth that thou didst love!âfor thou shalt perish where the cattle treadâthy bones and all thy children's bonesârotting upon the earth that Osceola would not give to thee! (Exit as the curtain falls) Act II Scene I (Osceola's cottage at a distance. Enter Osceola thoughtfully). Osceola Eternal Sun! thou father of the Stars, And husband of the Moon! I look upon Thy majesty as on the face of God! Thy glory fills the universe with light! Thy presence turns the darkness into day! When thou art in the Heavens, the earth looks glad! The birds begin to singâthe ocean smilesâ The rivers laugh in songâthe woods resound with melody! The iron Oak lifts up its silver-shafted arms To catch thy beams, as does some boy to drink His father's smiles! The Spring, at thy beloved Approach, lays down her carpet of rich green, Spangled with million flowers of every hue, Striped with the silver streams that wind along. Among the tasseled Reed-Isles to the Sea! Even Heaven looks happier gazing on thy face! Now, then, as thou hast clothed thy Warriour-clouds With golden armorâsent thy thunder-trump To muster up thy bannered host afar through Heaven! So shall my voice, from out my native Hills, Gather my mighty squadrons on the field For Battle. (Enter Celuta from the cottage) Where is Naymoyah now? Celuta Oh! ask me not, great Chief! the Eagle-Son Of Miccanopy loves her well! Osceola He does. The Hawk is on the wing; he will not spare The Dove. When did you see her last? Celuta Last night With Ostenee. Osceola Then she has sought his arms To save her Selma's life. The Lake of Swans Can show no whiter bred than she. But will The Lightning spare the pine because its boughs Moan in the winds? Celuta No, no, great Chief! But then They say that Selma shall be burned tonight! Osceola The Seminolean Eagle said not so. Celuta But if he is released, will she not go? And if Naymoyah go, this heart must break! Celuta loves Naymoyah well! Say, will She go? Osceola Noâas the grape-vine clings around The flowery Birch, so shall her arms take hold Of thee. She has not left Celuta yet. Celuta Then let her fly with himâfly with her loveâ And, in the sinless Solitudes lie down, Till they can walk the rosy paths in peace. Osceola You know the world is dark without the Sun; But it would be all day compared with her Without her heavenly Selma's love. But hark!! I hear young footsteps on the hills! She comes! Behold! Naymoyah comes! Celuta She does! She does! The Silver Swan comes to her Lake again! (Enter Naymoyah. They embrace) Swim on the bosom of Celuta's love, And let her soul grow white to image back Thy form! Osceola Naymoyah, Why art thou shedding tears? Naymoyah Oh! father! they have killed Naymoyah's love! Where is my Selma? When is he to die? Osceola Tonight, at Banqueting of souls! Naymoyah Tonight! Oh! father! let him not be burned tonight! Celuta No, Osceola! save Naymoyah's love. Osceola Fond daughter! he is Miccanopy's foe! And Osceola would not have him false! My child! I do not like those tears! Away! Naymoyah I tell thee, father, what I saw last nightâ I saw the great High Spirit, in my dreams, Walking upon thick clouds with eyes of fire! And, as he passed, he seemed to say to me, The very light that shines upon you now, Shall roll but fifty times through Heaven, when all In Ouithlacoochee's Vale shall pass away! Osceola Go, gentle daughter! get thee home again. (Exeunt Naymoyah and Celuta into the cottage). That dream has told me what my own soul knows. But what the eyes of that fair child have seen, That Osceola's soul shall never see! The Earth cannot despise the mighty Sun, Because his face is hidden by dark clouds; Nor is the soul of Osceola less The son of Outalissa, now its light Is rising on the world to set in blood! (Exit) Scene II (The Indian Council. Enter Selma guarded by Ostenee). Miccanopy (rising) When Osceola's father lived, he had A daughter whom he loved above all things; For he had made her Queen of all his Tribe. One day, when he was gone, the White-Man came, And throwing in the lake some Pearls of Love He brought with him, he won her heartâshe fledâ And, from that fatal hour, was never seen! The Chief of Cuscovilla's Vale returned. He visited the Fountain of Green Isles, But she was goneâgone to return no more! And when he prayed to Micabou, the God Of Waters, to restore him back his child, He said the Wakon-bird had killed his Dove, And borne her spirit to the Land of Souls! The flower of Cuscovilla's Vale was gone! And he who talked like Outalissa's son, Mustered his mighty host upon the hills, And laid the tall heads of his warriours low! Just so has Selma served Naymoyah's love! Now, Sachems, Warriours, listen to my voice! Before three Moons shall roll away in Heaven, The snorting Warhorse will be seen upon Our hills, trampling the desert flowers to earth! Before Manitou, who now rules the world, This Concha Shell shall prove the only sign Of what I wishâthat he shall die tonight! (Throws down the shell). Jumper (rising) The Pale-face comes to call his brotherâhas The Roe-buck cut upon his thighâthrows off The robe that made him Priest of all our Tribeâ Deceives usâleaves our homesâjoins with the whitesâ Betrays his loveâis caught againânow stands Up here to hear the sentence of his death! Then, by the Power that makes us what we are, Let him be burned tonight! (Enter Naymoyah falling in Selma's arms) Naymoyah Oh! Selma! love! Hast thou not done Naymoyah wrong? Speak, love! Oh! speak! for well she loves her darling's life Without the which her own must cease to be! The Indian Mico (rising to pronounce sentence). Young Selma! listen to my voice! Naymoyah Hold! hold! Stay the bold Eagle in his flight to Heaven! As well may ye attempt to curb me now! For if you touch one hair upon his head, The Seminolian falls to rise no more! What! know you not that if you wound the Swan, That she will tinge the waters with her blood? I tell you that the Spirit, Selma says Is God, came to me in my dream last night, And said, Naymoyah! tell this to thy tribe; The very light that shines upon you now. Shall roll but fifty times through Heaven, when all In Ouithlacoochee's Vale shall pass away! (Enter Osceola in haste) Osceola What is the matter here? Why is this noise Among the Chiefs, that should keep silence? Speak! Heard you the thunder of the White-man's host Upon the hills? Why are ye sitting here? Before me, in the visions of the night, Went the tall Warhouse through the Indians' camp, Lifting his trumpet-nostrils in the air, with feet Dabbling in blood! Heard ye no sound? Then hear! The fiery World, from her infernal depths, Seemed to disgorge the nostrils of her wrath! Oh! Warriours! if ye have not lost your souls, Why do ye tarry here? Do ye not know Ye cannot sentence any man to death Upon the night of Banqueting of Souls? Look to your wives, your children, to your homesâ For, lo! the Seminolian's hour is nigh! Mico Great Chiefs! What Osceola says is true. We cannot sentence any man to death Upon the night of Banqueting of Souls. It is against our customâcannot be. Miccanopy What! has it come to this? no laws, no rightsâ Except the one that sets the White-man free? No, by the gods! he shall die tonight! Osceola No, let thy son, the Eagle-Ostenee, Who hates him as he loves Naymoyah's life, Watch by him till he is condemned to die. Miccanopy It may be so. Confine him, Ostenee, Between two upright posts set in the ground, And guard him well! (To Naymoyah) You, prophetess of lies, Have spoken of the Seminolian's fall! Before the Tribe of Miccanopy falls, The Boy, that made thee tell me so, shall die! Away! she is the bride of Ostenee! (Exit Ostenee guarding Selma. The Council breaks up. Naymoyah kneels before Osceola). Osceola (to Miccanopy) Brave Warriour! had we not sworn so oft To link our hearts against the common foe, Mine had not suffered thee to taunt her so! But we are bound to be united now. To separate would only crush our hopes. But now no more until the war is done. Miccanopy Then we shall have no more to talk about. (Exeunt omnes) Scene III (In the forest. Moonlight. Osceola's cottage in the background. Enter Naymoyah). Naymoyah (kneeling) Oh! thou bright Daughter of the glorious Sun! Have ye no Selma in the Realms of Light, In whose bright presence ye can bask in joy? Oh! if ye have, descend upon me now, And from that Land, where Selma says is God, Bring me some tokens of his dying love, And let my spirit be at rest once more! I know that he must stand, ere long, before The ten fair Virgins of the Purple Hills, And there give out his dying soul to Heaven! Oh! thou fair Moon! whose beauty is the light Of his fair smiles, but tell me that he lives, And he shall meet me in thy hallowed beams, Purer than when he left me by the day! And if, tomorrow, he shall come again, Oh! let thy vigils teach me how to wait! I goâthine eyes are weeping on me now! My locks are wetâmy tears are mixed with thineâ And all the Stars seem mourning for me now! Bright Angel! Keep Naymoyah's soul tonight! (Enter Osceola) Osceola My daughter! though you see me as I am, Full of the torments of revengeâthere is A little drop of goodness in my heart. There are, upon the one side, frozen tears, And, on the other, fires as hot as Hell! It must be soâthere is no other hope! Shall he who braved the elements of Heavenâ Who walked for forty Summers in the storms, And passed as many Winters in the warsâ Treading the footsteps of his mighty God Walking in thunders through the clouds, unscaredâ Suffer the puny Pale-face to be Lord Above his childrenâwhile the slave, who sings His Corn-Song, walks upon his father's bones No! Never shall the Red-Man come to this, While this proud heart within my bosom beats, And knows that it is Osceola's heart! Naymoyah Why does the White-Man hate the Indian so? Osceola None but the great High-Spirit knows! No one, But God, can tell why they disturb us so! They envy even the very air we breathe! They come like Simighan, thy father did, To rob the Indian of his native land! Naymoyah But art thou not my father? Say thou art! Thou hast been more than father unto meâ Watching me like the Roe-Buck does the Fawn Cropping the languid blades of cane at even. Osceola I love thee, sweet Naymoyah! love thee well! Have loved thee from the hour that thou wert brought An Orphan to my Cabin door! But knowâ A Spaniard was thy father. Naymoyah Say not so! But if it be as thou hast said it is, Oh, tell me what they called my father's name? Osceola The Angels call him Lopezâbut the name Thy mother called him by, was Simighan. Naymoyah Ah! Simighan? What Angel tells my soul That I have often heard that name before? Was it not Selma told me so? It was. A faint remembrance of that blessed name Steals on my soul like Day does on the Dawnâ Melting the East to light! Osceola I knew when first Thy mother clung around thy father's neck. Naymoyah Then tell me what became of those dear ones Whose bosoms pillowed me in infancy? Osceola Ah! they are gone, gone, gone, alas! to meet The Big Light's Father in the Land of Souls! Thy father fell by Outalissa's hand! Thy mother died to see thy father die! Naymoyah 'Tis true for Osceola tells me so. And now my heart gives echo to the truth! Osceola I saw the White-Man's blood upon thy cheek, And could have slain thee in thine infant sleep; But chose to save thee as mine own, to show The Pale-Face how the Indian's heart can love. Naymoyah Thou wert my fatherâbe so to me now And, while they call me Osceola's child, Oh! save my Selma from the foe tonight! Osceola Fond daughter! listen to your father's voice! There is but one way you can save his life; And, missing that, he is forever lost! That way shall now be pointed out to thee. But, daughter! should it ever more be known That Osceola pointed thee that way, A Legion of foul fiends would have me bound, And bury me, amid their shouts, in fire! Then take this daggerâhide it in thy beltâ Go where your lover lies bound to the stakeâ Plunge deep into the heart of Osteneeâ And save thy Selma's life! Away! Naymoyah I go! By yonder fair Moon in the Heavens, he dies! (Exit). Osceola She shall be happy if I cannot be It is for this that Osceola lives, And means to lose the last drop in his heart. (Exit) Scene IV (Selma is discovered bound fast to a postâ Ostenee asleep on the ground by the fire). Selma I do not heed these savage fools! one hand Alone shall guide me through this gloomâ'tis God's! For though they drain the life blood from my heart, They cannot kill my soulâit is immortal! Nor will I swerve my conscious innocence For that poor, paltry recompence, called life. And though my spirit's efforts fail me here As some dear friend that would, but cannot, saveâ I still will put my trust in God above! (After a pause) How mournful are these beatings of my heartâ Tolling the requiem of my coming death, When all shall be together hushed in one Eternal silence, deeper than the grave! (Enter Naymoyah cautiously). Naymoyah Oh! thou great Spirit of the Land of Souls! My soul first offered up itself to Thee, As spotless as Thine own in pious prayer! As thou wert then, most merciful to me, Hear now, the soft petitions of thy child, Who, by thine unseen hand, has thus been led To be the Saviour of my Selma's life! Bright Daughter of the everlasting Sun! Look down upon me in this trying hour, And give me courage in this faint resolve, To execute the sentence of his death! Let not the White-Man, that is in my soul, But make the Indian strike the fatal blowâ Making the darker do the darker deed! (She takes out her dagger and walks cautiously up towards Ostenee). Selma Oh! God! Naymoyah! Naymoyah Selma thou shalt live! Selma Be still! Why did you come? Naymoyah To save thy life! How could Naymoyah see her Selma die? Selma Oh! God! were Ostenee to wake, we both Would die! Naymoyah But he shall never wake! Selma Be still! Naymoyah I knew the peril of this perilous hour; But, love being stronger than my fear of death, I come to rescue thee, or die! Selma Oh! God! Naymoyah Now then, this blowâdeep as my love for theeâ Selma Hold! hold thy hand! he sleeps! Naymoyah He does! he sleeps! Then let him sleep! I will unbind thy hands! (She unbinds his hands) Now Selma knows Naymoyah's soul is white. Selma I do! (Embraces her). Naymoyah Rejoice! for thou art free again! Selma I doâI doâmade happy by thy love! (Ostenee wakes, springs on his feet and, thinking her an evil spirit, exclaims,) Matchi Manitou! help, Areskou! help! Naymoyah (raising her dagger) Areskou! God of Battle! he is here! He comes to take thy life! (To Selma) Away! they come! (Exeunt) (Enter Warriours, who exclaim, with astonishment, on seeing Ostenee petrified, as it were, with fear,) What! has Manitou laid his spirit low? (The Curtain falls) End of Act Second Act III Scene I. (In front of Osceola's Cottage. Enter Selma and Naymoyah). Selma Now do mine eyes behold all that my soul Hath ever pictured to me in my dreams Of infinite Perfection, in thy form Of Angel beauty, whom my dying friend, In the last moments of his parting soul, Bade me remember. Naymoyah Selma! tell me all. Selma I must tell all, child of my lost friend, The generous Simighan, Naymoyah Was he thy friend, And my dear father too? Selma He was, my love! Come let me look into thy face again! A solemn dignity sits on thy brow, As if thou wert confirmed of their silent hour Thou Heaven-born child! 'Tis if thou wert Conceived of in the silent hour of prayer, When thoughts of Heaven, inhabited by Love, Formed in the soulâgathering to our sweet Starâ That Star thyselfâthou Queen of all on earth! Why was my soul so much obscured by doubt, That all thy heavenly loveliness could not Be taken in at one sweet draught? Oh! love! If ever Beauty mirrored back, in truth, The likeness of her parentage, thou art, Indeed, the child of my lost friend in Heavenâ The generous Simighan! Naymoyah Ah! that is true, For Osceola told me so. How kind! But what was equal to my mother's love? She who first pillowed me upon her breast, There, while the soft-tongued music of the winds, Lulled me to sleep among the camp. Oh! how my soul could love her, did she live, Seeing it loves her so now she is dead! Selma Now, fond Naymoyah! let me drink again The balmy nectar of thy rubiate lips. Thy beauty grows upon me like the light Of an immortal Moon, whose glorious face, Though waxing, never becomes fully full. A woman who hath purity within, Can find protection any where on earth; For while it superior finds her, it makes A majesty of gentleness. Naymoyah Most true. But let us flyâwe must not tarry hereâ And seek protection in the White-Man's camp. Selma Let not thy love, which makes this hour of all My life the sweetest to my soul, reveal To any one the Mystery of our fate. (Yells without). Hark! Miccanopy comes! Naymoyah We are betrayed! Selma Be not alarmed, but take this dagger. (She takes it). Naymoyah I am not strong in body, but in mind I tell thee, there is not, in all this world, A nobler, larger soul! Selma He comes! Naymoyah He dies! Enter Osceola Osceola Be not alarmed, young Eagle! thou art free! The tender feet that followed thee to where The frightened warriour left thee, are the ones That Osceola learned to walk. The arms That clung around thee, like the vine around The giant oak, were taught to do so by The gentle grasp of Osceola's hand. The blood that circles through thy veins, is not The Red-Man's bloodâtherefore, the Red-Man will Not trust the White-Man with his secret talk. Therefore, you must not leave the Indian's camp. Naymoyah We will not goâbut both remain with you. Osceola Let Osceola hear it from his lips. Selma It shall be so. Osceola Then listen to my voice; The turtle that is in thy heart, was caged By Osceola. She who grasps thy hand, Whose tender infancy was cradled in The wind-rocked branches of the flowery beachâ Has neither father, motherânone but thee And Osceola. Press her to thy heart, For Simighan is dead! Selma Yes, he is dead. But whose foul hand was base enough to slay That generous man? Oh! God! he was my friend! Osceola My father slew him!âOutalissa, son Of Miscou, Chief in Cuscovilla's Vale, Where rolls the mighty river of Mobile! (To Naymoyah) And she who died to see thy father die, Was Outalissa's child. Thy mother, dead, Was Osceola's sister. Naymoyah Hear it, Heaven. And watch above Naymoyah while she hears! Osceola She was the Virgin of the first fond love, Whom Simighan, the young Castillian stoleâ As Miccanopy told you long ago. The blood of Outalissa was not dark. I, therefore, have some White-Man in my soul. Naymoyah If father fell by Outalissa's hand, My mother's fatherâthen, by him she fellâ My mother dying to see my father die! Osceola Rejoice, young Virgin of the Lake of Swans! Thy mother died to see thy father die! Naymoyah How many Moons have passed since I was born? Osceola Just sixteen fallings of the leaf. Farewell! (Exit) Selma Naymoyah! thou didst hear that warriour say That Outalissa killed poor Simighan! But what were his last dying words to me? Theseâsave my Endea from the savage foe, And after she is saved, revenge my death! Now then, shall he who owes his life to this, Forget the promise that he made to him? No! for the Seminolian's hour is nigh. A bodiless soul came to my bed last night. And, in the voice of the departed, said, Remember, Selma, to avenge my death! The faithless shall receive no joy in heaven! Then, for the sake of my dear Endea, let Swift vengeance fall upon the Indian's head! By all the ties that bind me to the world! As well as those that bind me to the dead! I swear to dedicate my life to thee! Naymoyah But why should Grief go hand in hand with Joy? The mantle of my birth is lifted up; But who shall lift the Future Vail that hides Eternity from mortal sight? Selma I will! I will interpret all thy dreams for thee. (Exeunt). Scene II (Miccanopy's cottage. Enter Miccanopy to Ostenee). Miccanopy Where is the traitor? Show me where he is! Brave coward! Miccanopy hates thee now! Ostenee Hold, father! thou hast stung me to the heart! Miccanopy I meant my words should poison all thy soul! False, like the Serpent that is numbed with cold, Stinging the hand that brings it to the fire! So thou hast bitten him who gave thee life! Thou art no longer Miccanopy's son! Thy father hates thee as he does black Hell! Ostenee Wert thou to send thine arrows through my heart, The wound would be less mortal than thy words! Miccanopy May the deep festering wound be never healed! The Eagle never roosts with meaner birdsâ He has no friendship for the Coward Hawk That sits all day upon the high tree top, Watching his glory with an envious eye. Thy father rends thee, henceforth, from his heart! Ostenee I tell thee, father, fearless as thou art, Thy fiery heart had frozen to coldest ice, Hadst thou but seen what I beheld. Miccanopy Away! or Miccanopy has no son! Ostenee No, let me fight by Osceola's side, And in the battle try my hand again, Or, let me lie down in the Lion's den; Or, suffer five long Moons of banishment; Or, die ten thousand other living deaths, So that the coward Ostenee can have The brave old Miccanopy's love again. Miccanopy Then take this daggerâMiccanopy's hand Did use it long before thy birth! 'tis sure! And never fails against the White-Man's heart! And when Naymoyah looks upon thy face, Bid her remember that when winter comes, The Wild Rose cannot blossom on its own stalk, But must be grafted on the Indian Stem. Bring back that traitor or his head! Away! Or Miccanopy's curse be on thy soul! (Exeunt). Scene III (The Forest, Osceola's cottage in the distance. Enter Selma meeting Ostenee). Ostenee Rejoice, young boy! thine hour is come to die! Thy soul shall dwell among the stars tonight, The Fawn that meets the Lion in his path, Expects no favors but the quietest death! I come to tear that swan-down from thy back, And send thee to the River of the Dead! Therefore, prepare to match me in the fight! For know, the Virgin of the first fond love, Who loves her Selma as she does her lifeâ Lay on the bosom of my soul last night. Selma Base liar! say that dangerous lie again, And this bare hand shall smite thee down to Hell! Base dog! she sought thee only for my life! Ostenee Thy life! she sought me for her ownâmy love. With this right hand I smoothed her raven locks, While with her eyes she talked to me of loveâ Whispering for more than her sweet tongue could say. Selma No! that Angelic look was fiercer far Than Hell to thy damned soul! Come on! Ostenee I come! (They fight desperately for some time. Enter Naymoyah). Naymoyah Hold, warriour! hold! Naymoyah comes to save! (She stabs Ostenee in the back and he falls). Ostenee Matchi! Manitou! help, Naymoyah! help! (Dies). (Curtain falls) End of Act Third Act IV Scene I (Osceola's cottage. Enter Selma meeting Naymoyah). Selma The day begins to dawn. The sun is up, Gilding the purple dapple of the dawn With light bright as the world's first morn when God Came down to walk with Man in Paradise, And caught the coyness of his fresh-lipped youths Hiding among the flowers. The Night is gone. While, on the topmost peak of yon high hill, I see the russet Fawn stamping the flowersâ His trumpet-nostrils lifted high in air Above the flexile taper of his neck So lithe, as if to catch the faintest breeze That wantons byâeyeing the Hunter in The Vale belowâtelling his sister they Must flee away. Naymoyah Telling us too, to fly The Eagle will not spare the turtle, when Her young are famishing for food! Selma Most true! But then the storm that rends the towering Oak, Chariots the turtle to her native nest. The fiery bolt that rends the mountain Rock, Remakes the beauty of the tendrest flower. Then let us wrestle with the storms of Fate, Like Jacob with his Angel all the night. And rise up from the labor with the strength Of an immortal. Naymoyah Would to God we could. The truths are hallowed coming from thy lips But were thy lips to utter falsehoods now, Thy former truths would discover them all. Selma Then let thy Selma council thee to shun The false temptations of that wicked man. Naymoyah Who? Osceola? Selma Heâas false as Hell! But comeâwe now must go. Naymoyah Thank God for that! (Exeunt). Scene II (Tampa Bay. Martial music heard without. Enter Soldiers under the command of Major Dade). Major Dade Soldiers! You know the object of this march; It is to guard this country from the foeâ To save the helplessâsuccor the distrest. Impelled by justice for the injured dead, Let us be vigilant to meet them nowâ Our watchword being, Victory or death! On-on, brave warriours! for the battle-field! (Exeunt omnes.) Scene III (Osceola's cottage in the distance. Enter Osceola meeting Selma). Selma Great Chief! the Seminolian's hour is nigh! Osceola Why say you so? Then let it come. There is No terror in that warning now for me! I love the grandeur of my native Hillsâ The music of the streamsâthe roaring Windsâ Whirlwinds sweeping down the giant Oaks; For they have been companions from my youth. Selma Nay, curb this hostile madness of thy heartâ They will reward thee with a better home. Osceola What profit will that be to him who does Not wish a better one? Oh! foolish man! You little know what feasts the Indian's soul! Then, afterwards, call Osceola murderer. Telling their children, after they have learned To know what Osceola means, that here, Or there, or somewhere else, he cut their throats! Oh! how the White-man's tongue will tell them lies! These mighty thoughts have rushed across my soul, Like whirlwinds through the forest cane on fireâ Bearing their crackling cenders up to Heaven! I see before me what will be our fate! I see the dark cloud parted by the Storm, While through the rent comes down the fiery rain To blast the flowery earth beneath my feet! Selma But you will be rewarded for all this. Osceola Ah! what will pay me for the loss of home? Selma Why, money. Osceola Money! money! what is that? A little shining pale-face stuff that lies By promising that which it cannot buy! It cannot buy you friends that have been slain! Nor can it make the simplest thing on earth! Then what is it to all those joyful streams That fit the tongue for music like their own? Or, what is it beneath the moaning Pine To him who has been hunted by the foe, And needs the cool refreshment of the shade! What is it to those old familiar Oaks Of my acquaintance on my native hills? A thousand mountains of pure gold could not Purchase from me one of my children's graves. For what would all these mountains profit me If dying for one drop of water? Naught. When, if but one small stream gushing by, It would be worth more than their weight in gold. Then, who would help the mountain after that, The man, who lay there dying, for the stream? I tell thee that the thing called money, is Not what it seems to be. It cannot make The cooling breezes of the flowery Spring. And still proud man will hug it to his heart, And, rather than permit it to escape, Will drive his wife away in poverty! I hate the name of money. There is not A spark of honesty about the thing! It has no beauty in its shine for me, When underneath it lies the venomed sting That poisons many an honest soul to death, That, but for its acquaintance, would be just. It was my fate about three Moons ago, To give three pieces to my little boy, Who, from that moment forth, began to pine, But hugged them to his bosom till his death! I have not carried it about me since. There is some Magic in its serpent shine. It leads the mightiest warriours by the hand, As gently as the father leads his child, And he will listen to its foolish clink As if it were some music from the skies The purest gold that ever left the mine. Is blacker, on the outside, than the rock. It is the rock above that tells of gold Belowâas by the White-Man's smile is seen The outside cunning of his inside heart. But take this black stuff from its blacker back, And give it to the White-Man, he will lead Millions of mighty men to deadly war! Who, from the deathless love of love for it, Will see ten thousand deaths to live one life With that which has no sympathy for life; And call it gloryâfighting for their soilâ And, after all, be killed by it at last! And all for that infernal stuff which man Has dug up from the earth to cheat the world! There is no native shine upon its face. It only flitters like the Serpent's eyes, To charm the unwary flutterer to its jaws, Then afterwards, to swallow him down whole! Selma And thou wilt then, in spite of moneyâspite Of that great Capital which rules the world, And leads such mighty men to warâmake war? Osceola The eagle that has roosted on the pine, Will shake his pinions on the pensive bough, And, rising on the dewy breath of Morn, Shew him in joy to the Sun's Eye gloriously, Nor heed the frozen armour that has weighed All night upon his snowy wings. Farewell! (Exeunt) (Enter Naymoyah meeting Celuta). Celuta Come, beauteous Cygnet from the Lake of Swansâ (For thou hast seen the young Hind in thy dreamsâ) Celuta loves thee well! Naymoyah Why dost thou weep! Celuta Thou shalt not hear me sayâfor thou will know! Naymoyah Far well Naymoyah knows Celuta's heart. Celuta I asked Manitou from the Land of Souls, To heal the festering wound that grief had made; But there is no great Prophet in this world! Rejoice, Naymoyah! for we soon shall part! Naymoyah Why say you so, Celuta? speak to me! Celuta The White-Man's foot is now upon our hills, And Osceola goes to lay them low! The spirit of his father leads him on. I heard them, when the night was on thine eyes, Speaking of this great thing. Naymoyah He will not go. Celuta What! Osceola? He who told me so, Is firmer than the fixed Star of the Northâ I hear the thunder of the big-mouth drum. Coming in whirlwinds from the far-off Hills, To rouse the Warriours from their thousand tents! Now then, Naymoyah, listen to my voice; Swim not the roaring waters for my sake But come back to me at the New Moon, To the Valley of Sweet Waters, where the Fawn Lies speckling in the sun. I will not join The Old Times of my fathers, till I come To thee again. Celuta loves thee well. Naymoyah The Eagle may outsoar the dove, but yet The Dove flies swifter to her native nest. The Bee that gathers honey from the flower, Knows where to find that tender flower again; And, as it hungers for the same sweet flower, So will Naymoyah for Celuta's love. Celuta Gather the Wild-flowers by the Roaring Stream, And, just five moons from this, come down to me Where the young Doe suckles her Fawn in love By the light of the moon by night. Farewell! Naymoyah Nay, stay Celuta! tears are in thine eyes! Celuta Naymoyah! They are shed for thee! Farewell! Remember, that Celuta loves thee well! (Exeunt) Scene III (The Indian Camp. Yelling without. Enter Warriours commanded by Osceola, and attended by Jumper and Miccanopy.) Osceola Brave Warriours! we have gathered here today To swear destruction to the White-Man's soul! Now, like the furious Hurricane let loose From Hell to fell his prarie-path along The woods; so let us with our blood hound yells, Pour lightning thunders on their heads, till all The woods are shaken with the cries of death! Miccanopy Hear you the thunders of that voice? Shout! The Tommahawk is now dug up againâ Never to rust beneath the Tree of Peace! Osceola Now, Warriours! place your hands upon your hearts, And with the fresh remembrance of our wrongs, Continually reminding us of home, Sweat never to smoke the Calumet of Peace Again with man, till we are free! Now shout! (They shout). Brave Warriours! Osceola has been chained! These hands that, with my father's locust-bow, once stayed The bold Eagle in his flight to Heavenâ Piercing the bosom of the milky Swan Soaring aloft above the Reed-Isles greenâ They have been chained-chained by the power of man! For that indignity the White-Man dies! No! never shall my soul find rest again, Until the wound made by that chain is healed! For, like the gathering fury of the stream, That from the cataract's awful brink rolls down, Like one hurled hopeless into Hell to sink; So gathers in my soul the mighty power That strengthens while I speak! Now let us teach The puny Pale-face what it is to rouse The vengeance of the Indian's hate! On-on! (Exeunt omnes.) Scene IV (An open pine barren, with a beautiful Lake in the back. alarums without. Enter Soldiers under the command of Major Dade.) Major Dade Here, Nature dwells in all her majesty. No human habitation here disturbs The quest of this solitary scene. But here where we now standâwhere none but feet Of savages were seenâshall soon, A civilized community be seen, Whose hands shall rear them prosperous little towns While modest maidens, beautiful as pure, With gentle coyness ripening into love, Shall dignify existence with their own; And joyful children, happy in their sports, Sing songs where Savages now yell aloud; And we shall be the foremost who shall lead This Empire on. But hark! I hear them now! This Empire onâ (The Indians yelling furiously without, fire upon them scattering them in all directions. Miccanopy encountering Major Dade, after fighting manfully for some time kills him, while Osceola is seen laughing across the stage in triumph, as the curtain falls.) End of Act Fourth Act V Scene I (Dade's battleground. Enter Soldiers under the command of General Gaines, who march to the sound of mournful music around Major Dade's grave. General Gaines Soldiers! beneath this little spot of earth, (And hallowed be the land that gave him birthâ) Lies gallant Dade the bravest of the brave, Who we had all most freely died to save! (They march around his grave again.) All that could dignify the valorous heart, And make him nobler than the rest of man, Impelled him onward to his Country's cause. The noblest sense of justice that the voice Of pure Religion ever taught to man, Inspired him for the sacrifice you seeâ When, from the Altar of his body slain, Arose the finest Offering in his soul That ever fled away unstained to Heaven. But what could he bequeathe his Country's cause More sacred than the noblest of her sons? The utterance of my lips is far too poor To speak his praises whose sad death deserves An eulogy pronounced by Angels' tongues. Though his lamented death now mourned by all, Disdains the mockery of my feeble praise, Yet it shall be the Argument for song In Future Ages when the dulcet strains Of Genius shall flow down the tide of Time To fill Eternity with noble deeds! Let not the Sacred Vail that hides him in This solitude, be lifted from his grave; But let the Silence that surrounds him here, Speak the deep gratitude of all our hearts! For speechless as this solitude now is, There is, about its stillness, more profound And audible eloquence, then in the deep And loud-mouth thunder! All is silent now! There is no deep-toned bell to toll, in long Drawn intervals, the Requiem of his death! There is no pompous monument to rear Its ghostly aspect for the passers by! The Silence of this tongueless Solitude Shall speak sublime language for the dead, Than ever could the cold lips of the pale And letered Monument! The mighty Winds In Nature's stormy concert shall attune The shafted columns of the giant Oaks In wonderous melody to sing his praise. His Country's voice can speak his virtues best. What are the glorious Sepulchres of Kings, To genius laureled with immortal fame? The one is fleeting as the drunkard's thoughtsâ The other lasting as the immortal soul. The weakness of my heart has sealed its tears With the brave poet that I am called to act. The Soldier in the battle-strife weeps not Above the body of his brother slain. The funeral pageant keeps the mourner's tears All dry until at some auspicious hour, When, like the unsealed gratitude of Heaven, The heart pours out its weight of wo unseen; And gathering strength from such divine relief, Wakes vigorous like the strong man for the race. (They march around his grave again to mournful music.) Hail, Music! blessed Angel of the skies! There was no language worthy of the Sons Of God, but music such as Angels used, To celebrate the Birth-day of the World. The mighty cataracts were heard to pour Their giant voices on the ear of Night! And now, the humblest of Columbia's Sons Lift up their proud hearts responsive to the strain. But shall that brave man's death be unavenged? No! let the lasting memory of his name Sink deep in all our hearts for fierce revenge! The blood-stained earth looks in the peaceful face Of Heaven, imploring vengeance on the foe! The last fond duty that we owe the dead, Is thus to scatter flowers upon his grave! (They scatter flowers on his grave to the sound of mournful music, then march out.) Scene II (The banks of the Ouithlacoochee. Alarums without. Enter Indian Warriours commanded by Osceola. Osceola Rejoice, brave Warriours! for the day is ours! During the battlement the cries abroad, Rending the columns of sulphurous smoke, As through the gorgeâlike vista soared the souls, Where looked they back upon destruction near, But tempest-towering took them to the sky; While those who had not perished in the fight, Lay calling out for Mercyâbut their cries Were unavenged for Mercy did not come. But Miccanopy came, that old Top Chiefâ The good old governor of the Lake of Swansâ Who meeting their brave general front to front, Stood up before him there with eyes of fire, As if to see which one should die the first, When gathering fury from the panting pause, As clouds collect their lightnings in the skyâ The brave old Miccanopy laid him low! But while they thus contendedâafter all Were slainâaway fled Glory from the Field, Bearing her white-winged daughter, Hope, with herâ And dashing down her laurels at our feet, Left Indian Victory trampling them to dust! Onâon, brave Warriours! for another fight! (Exeunt omnes.) Scene III (General Gains' camp. Enter General Gains meeting Soldiers bringing in Naymoyah captive.) General Gains What is thy name, young girl? Naymoyah Naymoyah, Sir. General Gains A beautiful Indian name. But say, Art thou as good as thou art beautiful? Naymoyah Ask Selma, he can tell. General Gains Ah! who is he? One whom Naymoyah loves? Naymoyah As thou hast said. Didst ever love thy mother, fatherâwife? If so, then smile not at Naymoyah's love. General Gains Where are thy father, mother, brothersâfriends? Naymoyah Where poor Naymoyah soon would be, had she Not Selma's love! General Gains Your parents, then, are dead? Naymoyah I have no father, motherânone but thee And Selma! Will you let me go to him? General Gains What is he more than any other man? Naymoyah The same as is thy life-blood to thy heart, Which cannot do with any other blood. General Gains His name says he is not of Indian blood. Naymoyah Had he been so, Naymoyah had not loved. General Gains But thou wilt soon forget him in this camp. Naymoyah Soon as the turtle dove forgets her mate, And soars off with the Vulture to find rest. Soon as the mother shall forget her childâ Or any other most unnatural thing Shall come to passâwhen love shall not be loveâ Then will Naymoyah cease to love her love. General Gains Then it is better thou hadst never loved. Naymoyah The Moon shines brightest in the darkest night. General Gains We think, we love, in absence, better than We know we do, when the beloved is nigh. Naymoyah The more we know of that which gives us joy, The more of joy we feel in knowing it. And 'tis the attribute of spotless love To cling to that which is congenial to it. Thus have we clung together like two birds Born on one stalkâso, if you take away The one that helped the other on to live You will be sure to take the life of both (She kneels.) General Gains Oh! woman! woman! who shall speak thy praise? Thou art the brightest perfection of the Heavensâ Our Sun by dayâour Pillar of Fire by nightâ The only Light we have on earth to lead Our Ship of Life save in the Port of Heaven! Rise up, Naymoyah! thou art free to go. (Enter an Officer) Officer General! we have an Indian spy in camp, Who says he is an exile from old Spain General Gains A Spanish exile as an Indian spy! Well, that is strange! what is his name? Officer 'Tis Selma, so he says General Gains Then bring him forth (Exit officer.) Perhaps he is in search of that fond girl. (Reenter Officer with Selma) Selma General! untimely as this visit seems, It could not have been made in better time. Like all the Workings of the Natural World, It brings along with it its own reward. General Gains But you are called an Indian spy. Selma The calling does not change the being called. General Gains But are you not an exile from old Spain? Selma And hoping in such destiny to know That kind Misfortune placed me in your powerâ Proving that there is joy for all our pains. My Prophecy is now fulfilledâmy cup Of vengeance full. General Gains Thy cup of vengeance full! What does he mean? I do not understand! Selma Misfortune, who was tutor to my youth, Has left me wiser than most men. My fate Had long ago been sealed in death, had it Not been preserved by one most dear to me. Now that my oath is registered in Heaven, I swear to be the husband of that girl, And take revenge for her dear father's death! General Gains Then it is private wrong, not public good, That brought you here? Selma Though circumstance may change The outward man, no destiny can change The inward soul. The Rose is just as sweetâ Will give out just as many hues to Heavenâ Born in the Desert, as in Paradise General Gains Perhaps you know the Indian girl they call Naymoyah? Selma She it was who saved my lifeâ Stabbing the thirsty blood-hound to the heart, Who stood above me, threatening me with death! General Gains She did not seem the savage thou hast said. Selma Love that is tenderest in the peaceful hour, Is strongest in the hour of greatest ill. I trust that she is safe now in your bounds? General Gains No, she was taken captive in the fight, But craving to return, we let her goâ Breathing your name with accents full of love. Indeed she seemed the model of her sex. Selma Yes, General, we are destined to be one. No power can separate us now on earth. And now to consummate this hope, let me Unfold the object of this interview. I will direct your soldiers to the camp Where Osceola in his fastness lurks, And make him captive an hour from this. General Gains Then you would hook him with his own foul bait? Selma The Rising Sun will rise to set no more. Come, General, do not scruple at your wish. An armistice like this will make him fast, And cancel all the debt of my revenge. General Gains The Soldiers of the camp are free to go; But should you prove untrueâremember Heaven! Selma Then he is ours. Now Soldiers, follow me. (Exeunt omnes) Scene IV (Osceola's Tent in the Indian camp. Celuta is discovered scattering flowers on the dead body of her child.) Celuta Bright Rose of the Desert! brightest of all! Thou wert the first young love of Celuta's heart! I baptized thee with the new milk from my breast, In the shadow of the aged Oak, where Thy poor dear mothers shall see thee no more! The Pigeons may come from the frozen North, And the young Doves from the Isles of the Sea, But thou, oh, my soul! will return no more! (Enter Osceola.) Osceola. Celuta! the big tears are in thine eyes! The Great Spirit, who tries the soul of men, Will lead us along by our father's groves To where the spirit of our young child lives! Celuta He is gone to the Big Light's Father there To rest in the arms of the Milky Moon. But will the White-Man tread upon his bones? Osceola Yes, they will crush his body into dust! But the hour is nigh when the silent woods Shall tremble again at the warriour's voice, And the sulphurous smoke of the noisy gun Turn the bright Sun up in the Heavens to eclipse! Two Moons ago, we had no tears to shedâ Now we are fuller than the sea with waves! (Enter an Indian Warriour guarding Selma who is disguised as a Soldier.) Warriour Great Chief! this captive Soldierâshall he die? Osceola What is his name? Selma Graham. Osceola Graham? that voice? Noâlet him go. Warriour But Miccanopy says All White-men, caught by us, must die. Osceola Touch not A hair upon his head! I recollect he cured A little child of mine some Moons ago; And Osceola's heart does not forget. The best of men are not without some fault, And for the little that is in my soul, He shall not die. Let him alone! away! (Exit warriour.) Selma Our general sent me here to say to you That he is tired of war, and now wants peaceâ That all who carry rifles in their hands, From this day forth, shall be shot down. Osceola (aside) That voice! That is not Graham's voice!âGo, tell thy Chief I am the Gulf Stream of the Sea of all My people. Did you ever know it to run back? When did the Eagle ever cease to be A bird of prey because the turtle mourns? Then put thy one hand into both of mine And take back to thy general all my heart, And tell him that the streams run down the hills. Selma Perhaps thy people will agree to this. Osceola The Chiefs are the Hills of their native landâ The people are the streams from these great Hills. When they all gather into one great Stream, There is no power on earth can stay their course! A full blood Indian never changed his mind. So Osceola, called the Rising Sun, And Miccanopy, old Top Chief, Can never change. Go tell thy general this. (Enter Soldiers, armed, who surround Osceola). Selma Look, Osceola! look! they come for thee! Behold, the soul of Simighan is here! (Throwing off his disguise). Osceola Oh! ye Almighty Whirlwinds of the Deep! Gather yourselves together in the clouds, And mustering up the Engines of your wrath, In one consuming Cataract of Fire, Let it be syllabled in one deep word, And let that word be poured out by the mouth, Of an immortal Thunder as the curse Of Osceola on that traitor's head! What, Selma? is this you, my boy? then die! (Osceola stabs him and, in falling, is caught by one of the Soldiers). Selma Oh, God! Where is Naymoyah? Call her here! To me! there! hold! she did not think of this! Brave Soldiers! lash him to the same foul stake They bound poor Selma toâthen cut his throat! I go to find Naymoyah! Fare thee well! (Exit). Osceola No mortal's eyes did ever yet look on The full-orbed glory of the Rising Sun Unblinded! Never yet did mortal man Stand up to Osceola, face to face, And afterwards, confronting him to live! The prize he has been fighting for is life; The one foe which he now contends is death! So meet me every coward one of youâ Come on, ye pale-face, chicken-hearted brats! And let me teach you Indian skill! No, stand! And let your hearts grow stronger by delay! For now ye all stand huddled round like sheep. Stamping the desert earth with meaning looks Each one the other watching who flies first! Ye may be Stars of Certain magnitude, But already flabbergasted at the Rising Sun! But now that he has passed his noontide hour, Where none shall ever shine as he has shone! And setting, never more shall shine again! In the dark night that he shall leave behind, Shine out the little sparks of light, ye have The brightest in the darkest hourâfor now The cloud that passes on my soul, shall be The darkest that the Indian ever saw! Look at the plague-spot that your treachery daubs Upon the brightest name that ever shone! But all the glory ye shall ever gain By gazing at this huge eclipse, is that Which Osceola's name shall give to thineâ Linked with the foulest deed that ever stained The Annals of the damned! The Night is here! (turning to Celuta) Celuta! come to me, my love! look up! See how my foes now compass me around! Celuta Alas! what will they do with thee, great Chief? Osceola The great high Spirit, who now walks in Heaven, Has called for Osceolaâhe must go! Celuta! we must part! Celuta Oh! say not so! Osceola What the Great Spirit says, it must be done! Celuta How long will thou be gone? Osceola Five Moons or more. If any longer, than wilt come to me, Where the Great Spirit lives! But do not weep! And when the Sun goes down upon the Sea, Leaving the full orbed Moon walking through Heaven In Silenceâsee how very true she isâ Be so to Osceola! Celuta That I will! Osceola But, White-Man! write not Osceola's name! No! bring him back again, when he is dead And dig his grave deep in the blessed earthâ Here, where the noisy cataract now sings The wild sweet anthem of his native land, And tells the world of freedom! Lay me here; And let the joyous birds sing at my grave! But write not Osceola's name again! Let not the White-Man stain the virgin sheet Writing the name that he has blackened so! For it is written on the mighty Hills In characters that shall outlive the Sun! No, White-Man! lock it in the deep cold grave With Osceola's heart!âthere let it rest! And when the dusky slave shall come to tell The Axman's Signal to my native Oaksâ Rousing the ponderous silence of the woods With pompous noise of axesâbid him tread Not on the willow-shaded grave of him Who never looked upon created thingâ Save on the footsteps of his Godâwith fear! Then, when they tread upon my father's bones, That they shall plough up from my native soils, They will remember Osceola's name, And stand upon his only Monument! And when the children, wandering through the woods, Shall pluck the flowers that he has gazed upon, Teach them to say that Osceola died Just as he livedâthe White-Man's foe! (turning to Celuta again) Look up, thou bending flower to the Setting Sun! And catch the last fond glimmer of his beams! For, in one hour from this, he will be darkâ Dark as the unlighted world beyond the grave! How hard it is for me to part from thee! Harder than dying by the White-Man's hand! But it must beâthere is no other hope! Soldier Great Chief! thy wife is privileged to go. Osceola Who was it spoke that blessed word? Thank God! (Exeunt omnes). Scene V (Selma is discovered leaning against a moss-covered rock in the desert. Enter Naymoyah as if in search of him). Naymoyah Oh! God! what is it that I see? my love? (Rushes to him and kneels by his side) Selma Naymoyah! Naymoyah Selma! Selma I did look for thee! Naymoyah What is the matter, Selma? speak, my love! There's blood upon thy bosom! speak to me! Selma By hoping future pleasure, present woes Took sudden birth! Naymoyah! I must die! (Falls back and dies). Naymoyah What! Selma! do not die! speak to me, love! (Feels his head). No! the nest is warm, but the bird has flown! There! there! the white wings of my first fond love Pluming his soul for instant flight to Heaven! See! on the rosy atmosphere of Joy, It soars away to find the Blessed Isles! The sweet little bird of my hope is gone, Pillowed away up in the peaceful sky Upon the beautiful wings of his soul! Oh! beauteous Island in this Sea of Life! How dark have been the waves around thee cast! How fond Naymoyah loved to worship thee, And make thy life as joyous as her ownâ Moulting thy bosom with the Spring of Love! Now, now, on the same bosom will I die, Where I first built my utmost hope of lifeâ Here, on this little island girt by waves Of sorrow, dashing on him nowâlie down! Oh! God! they rush upon him now! they roll! They roll! they roll! I drown beneath the waves! I drown beneath the waves that drown my love! I sink beneath the sea that whelms his soul! I hear it now, oh! God! I hear it now! It rolls! it rolls! it rolls above his headâ Washing away my utmost hope of life! Now, farewell, world! Wait, Selma, wait! Naymoyah comes to thee! Wait, heavenly dove! I come to thee! I come to thee in Heaven! (Dies). Curtain falls End of Act Fifth</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Charles Stuart Prince of Wales; Or, The Minstrel of Mirandola; A Romantic Drama, In Five Acts Preface The grandeur of this play is historical. It is founded on the principle achievements of that most extraordinary man, Charles Stuart who aspired to the throne of Scotland. His adventures were enthusiastic and striking. He was patriotic and valorous. His nature was as noble as his ambition was great. His ambition was unlawful, and he saw the vanity of his undertaking by reaping the harvest of a perilous defeat. The incidents of his career are made use of only as the basis of the superstructure of the Drama. The character of Madalena was suggested to the author by a beautiful story which he read in one of the papers three or four years ago. The object of the drama, as will be seen by the plot, is to develop the vanity of unlawful ambition, and, in contradistinction to it, the pleasure that may be derived from following the dictates of the Deity, as recognized in the nature of things. The Author has attempted to make this vanity, of which he was the victim, the more conspicuous in the domestic felicity which he is supposed to have enjoyed after his defeat. How far he has succeeded is left for his friends to judge. May 1st, 1838 Persons of the Drama Men Charles Stuart, Prince of Wales. Francisco, a Monk. Boisdale, a Highlander in love with Flora.

Then it shifts back again to Mirandola in the Fifth Act. Act I Scene I Mirandola, a magnificent Apartment in the Palace of Charles Stuart. He is seated on a sofa reading a letter. Enter his daughter, Madalena, with a bouquet of flowers in her hand. Charles Stuart (coming forward) I have received most joyous news from France, The Cardinal informs me in this letter, That every thing is ripe for active war; And earnestly requests me, in the same, To be in Paris by the earliest date, And thence embark for Britain. Madalena Nay, sweet sire! It cannot be that we must part? Charles Stuart We must, Sweet Madalena! we must part tonightâ Tomorrow I must be in Rome. Madalena Tonight, Dear father? Would you have me here alone? Charles Stuart I am appointed General of the Troops. Prepared for Scotland, whither we now go To seat thy royal sire upon the throne, Of his great ancestors. Madalena But should you fall? Charles Stuart I have prepared for thee the best of homes, The convent, where, if I should chance to fall The arm of persecution will be stayed. Madalena The convent would be death without thy love! Charles Stuart Nay, do not weep, but rest assured it is The royal House of Scotland calls me hence; For now my ardent spirit pants to see The diadem of Caledonia wave In glory over Stuart's lictour once more; And when that fatal hour shall come, in which The destiny of Brunswick shall be sealed, And Scotland's deathless glory shall be made An epitaph for England in her grave, Then shall the royal Madalena share The glory that encircles Charles' brow, And down the stream of time descend with him To after ages, as the holiest name That ever graced the noble line of kings. Madalena I know it is your duty calls you hence, And feel it is most fruitless to complain; But then, you know, to mourn is woman's lot! And, oh! to part from one we hold so dear, It seems like taking from the rill its source, And then expecting that that rill should run! Charles Stuart Come, Madalena we will part in joy Madalena Can not the sceptre of Placenza shield The child of Valentina from all harm? Charles Stuart The royal arm from which you might expect Protection, looks most jealously upon The house of Stuart, who is but, at most, Thy Princess mother's distant relative, And whose imperial law of state is, none But male descendants can ascend the throne; Therefore, the Convent is the safest place, Where, if by some base hand I chance to fall, My marriage with thy mother still unknown To Englandâyou may be protected by Good Angela, the tutoress of your youth, And Madre of the Convent. Come, my child. Madalena Then it must beâthere is no other hope! (Exeunt.) Scene II (A parlour in the Convent of Santa Maria della Pieta. The bell is tolling for midnight vespers. Enter Comptessa, Angela di Pianneza, attended by the Madre of the Convent). Madre Where is thy son? Angela He will be here tonight. Madre I hear he is a noble boy. Angela He is A noble boyâthe fountain of my life Madre The current of thy life, thou shouldst have said; Thou art the fountainâhe the stream. Angela We are So one another unto each. The stream Returns to feed the fountain, as the fount The stream; without the one the other could Not live. Madre And yet thou livest without thy boy. Angela Our seldom meetings oftener touch the heart. Madre I was a mother once. Angela Where is thy child? Madre He will not visit me tonight! Angela Is he Afar in some strange land? Madre Not strange to him. Angela Will he not come again? Madre No more! Angela No more? How fearfully it sounds! Madre No sound like that! That echo which the grave gives back to us, When the last clod is hurled upon it from Above! Angela Then he is dead? Madre Alone in heaven. You are mistaken in the deadâthey do Not dieâthey live again. Angela Died he at birth? Madre He died when youngâthe loadstar of my life The brightest in the heaven of women's love! Angela I pity thee, because thy son is dead! Madre Pity thyselfâbecause thy son is dead! Angela He is not dead? Madre Long as he lives on earth. Angela Alas! what if he were? Madre Then he were blest. Earth has no joyâthe soul no home, but heaven. Angela But then a mother's love is great. Madre It is The greatest of all earthly thingsâbut not The joy of heaven. Angela But you would have him here? Madre I wouldâbut rather he were there in joy, Than here in grief! Methinks I see him now! The memory of his smile, how bright it is! The Angels play about his couch tonight! Angela Think you he hovers near us now? Madre He does In that immortal shape that cannot die! I hear his voice from out the pastâit speaks To me! Angela Who spake to you! I heard no voice! Madre The spirit of my child! Its knock is heard at the door. Angela Fernando should be here. Madre Let him alone. For you there is much joyâfor him the path Of life is strewn with thorns! A knock again! Open the doorâsome person comes. Angela (going) Tis he! (Enter Charles Stuart with his daughter Madalena). Charles Stuart I pray you pardon me, good madre mine, For this intruding at so late an hour; For Good Report has said so much of thee That this Senora is entrusted as A boarder to thy care. She is my child, A Cardinal will tell you who she is, This letter recommends her to your care. (Giving her the letter). So now, my best belovedâmy only childâ Farewell! Madalena Nay, father! do not leave me yet! Oh! is it not too hard to part from thee? (Falling in his arms). Charles It is, sweet daughter! but it must be so! Once more, sweet Madalena, fare thee well! (Embracing her, and exits). Angela The royal Madalena should not weep Come, royal lady, this is out of place, And sadly will affect your noble mind! Madalena Sweet Angela! forgive these tender tears, And know, my sacred mother, that they fall Not for myself, but for my sire alone! Do you not see that he has left me here, Beneath the guardian Angel of your love, To guard me from the watchful eyes of those Who would exterminate this hated race? I feel that he must fall! Angela Nay, think not so, For he that wears upon his lofty brow The impress of his royal father's seal, Can never fail of rich success. Madalena (aside) There is But one alternativeâone hope is leftâ And that shall frame the purpose of my soul, At whose invention all the world shall gaze! I will not chain my fortitude for naught, But climb Ambition's ladder to the top, And make my noble daring, overleap All but the deathless love that gave it birth! As woman's love transcends all other love, So shall her Fortitude, the child of love, Be made the prompter of such noble deeds As kings shall wonder at with loftiest thought, And find no parallel on earth or sea! Angela Come, royal lady, we must now to bed, See, it is growing late, the lamps are dim. (Exeunt omnes.) Scene III (The same apartment in Charles Stuart's apartment. He is seated in a sofa reading a letter. Enter Francisca and a Monk). Francisca I wait your orders, good my lord. Charles Stuart Wait till You shall receive them an hour from then. Francisca I will attend to you, my lord. (Starting away.) Charles Stuart Nay stay, You know my daughter is in the convent now. Watch over her as if she were your own. Francisca It shall be done my lord. When go you hence? Charles Stuart Tomorrow I must be in Rome. Francisca May heaven Protect you on your route. Charles Stuart The same to you. (Knocking is heard.) But stay, Francisca. See whose knock that is. (Exit Francisca, who returns again.) Francisca A page is now in waiting at the door, And craves admittance. Charles Stuart He must wait awhile, I have some business to attend to now. Francisca Straight from the Princess, so he says, my lord. Charles Stuart What! from my daughter? Show him in (Francisca shows him in. Enter Madalena, his daughter disguised as a Page.) Page (bowing) My lord. (Handing him a letter.) Charles Stuart Whence comes this pacquet, boy? How fares my child? (Opening the letter.) Page So please your royal highness, she is well. Charles Stuart What! is it possible that she has sent The young Di Ossima to be my page. Page It is as you have said, my lord. Charles Stuart Why so? Page I sang for her the song of other days, And while my spirit panted for the war, Watching the enthusiastic tears steal down My cheek from joy which overflowed my heart, She loved the soul that gave such music birth, And chose me from that moment as thy Page, Saying that while you listened to my songs, You might remember her when far away. Charles Stuart But tell me, gentle Page, what is thy name? Page Fernando, may it please my lord. Francisca (aside) What! young Fernando? By my troth, it is her boy! Charles Stuart Thy gentle form but ill befits the war, Thou art not more than sixteen years of age? Page I am, your highness, seventeen or more. Charles Stuart Our voyage is too great for one like thee. Thou art as gentle as the summer breeze Laden with perfumes from the odorous flowers. Page And yet my nature, like that summer breeze, When roused to valor by the breath of Fame, Can rise as far above its gentler self, As Ocean, troubled by the angry winds, Is more tempestuous than the placid lake. Oh! how my ardent spirit pants to see The doubtful conflict on the battle-field, Between two kingdoms, where the bristling spears To the lightning-music such brisk contention keep, As stars commingling on the raging sea! Charles Stuart But when the martialed multitudes are spread In countless thousands on the battle-field, And when their armour glittering in the sun, Shall strike thine eyes with one effulgent blaze; And when the clashing spears, the glittering helms, And splintered javelins, with one obstreperous clang, In terrible array of close-wedged troops, Shall mingle with the charge of neighing steeds; Methinks the harp would better suit thy strength, Than such calamities of war. Page My lord! Peril is joy to him whose heart is brave. Charles Stuart My noble boy! indeed, where got you this? The Convent is no place for such as thou. The glossy ringlets of thy raven hairâ The upturned flashings of thy darker eyes, The olive colour of thy roseate cheeks, Those frolic-smiles, alternate to the scorn Which sits enthroned upon thy roseate lips, All speak the language of thy noble birth And more, the freedom of an honest heart. From this day forth it shall be known to all, That young Di Ossima shall be my Page, And bear me company to Scotland's shore. (Exit Francisca.) Page (Kneeling) Most royal master! let me thank thee on My knee, for filling thus Fernando's heart With more than mortal joy! this hand shall be The Guardian Angel of my king's life; These lips shall soothe him in the hour of grief; And when some ruthless hand shall aim the blow At his proud heart, it first shall pass through mine! Charles Stuart Most noble boy! look up, my generous youth! I love thee almost as my own dear child! Fernando (Kneeling) I thank thee on my knees, my noble lord! Charles Stuart Rise up, my noble boy! you should not kneel. But said you not that you could sing, my boy! Fernando I did, my lord. What will you have? One grave Or gay? Charles I do not care, choose for yourself. Invoke you Thalia, or the Muse of Pan? Fernando Not eitherâCaliope, my noble lord. The mother of Apollo's noble son, Whose life-inspiring tones made rocks to move, And rivers cease to flow. The savage beasts Forgot their wildness in his docile strains, And mountains danced in gladness to his song; Fernando's Song Higher than eagle ever flew, When to the dayâgod he ascends; And louder than trumpet ever blew, When its blast with the cannon blends; Shall the name of Stuart high-lifted be On the wings of Fame after victory. Longer than time shall ever last, When the rivers shall cease to roar When all but the end of the world is past, And Death has encircled the sun; Shall the name of Stuart high-lifted be On the wings of Fame after victory. Charles Stuart The music of thy liquid voice is like The eloquence of an embodied song; Which feeds upon its own sweet melody. But, come-tomorrow we must be in Rome. (Exeunt.) (Enter Francisca leading in Madalena.) Madalena Stay, my father! answer me this onceâ Is Angela the sister of the Nuns? Monk Why ask me that which you already know? You saw her there last night. Madalena I saw her notâ I have not seen her for these many months. Monk You are mistakenâyou beheld her there Last night. Madalena What! art thou blind? Monk You are, or would Play false, if you pretend you saw her not. Madalena Indeed I saw her not. Has he not heard of this before? Oh, speak! Monk I tell thee Angela is with the Nuns And wrote to soothe thee in thy sorrow. Madalena She has no medicine can cure this grief! Monk Nay, cheer thee upâthy sire will come again. Madalena Why speak of him? I have no sire! Monk No sire? Nay, you are crazed, my child. You should go home. Madalena I shall go soon enough. Monk Come, you must go with me. Madalena No, father! broken-hearted as I am, I would not follow thee from this to Heaven, Until I hear the truth of what I seek; Then if it be as thou hast said it is, I care not if you take me to the grave! Monk What blasphemy is this to shirk my care? Madalena I sought thee knowing thou wouldst speak the truth. Monk Who doubts my word? Come, you must go with me. Madalena Not yet until the thunderclap is heard And the fierce lightning blast me! Monk Not till then? Then all the convents in the world were naught! Madalena Now comes the thunderstroke! It blasts me now! Monk Why talk you thus? Madalena Fernando, then, is gone? Monk He went with Stuart to the war. Madalena Then I am lost! (She faints in his arms.) Monk Oh, royal mistress! do not faint! She must not die so soon! Oh! do not die! Thou, Father! hear thy servant's prayer! restore This child again! She breathes! my prayer was heard! Look up again! look up, my child! She lives! Oh! speak to me! Madalena Then bear me to his arms! Monk Be calm! thy father will return again! No mischief shall befall the royal Charles! Was ever daughter's love so great as this! (Exit, bearing her out.) Scene IV (A parlour in the Convent of Santa Maria della Pieta, as in Scene Second. Enter the Madre and Angela.) Madre Well! where could she have gone? Angela I do not know. She slept in the adjoining room to mine! Madre And are you sure she went to bed? Angela Most sure. Madre The gates were not left open through the night? Angela I think they were all shut. Madre It is most strange. But, see, some person comes! it is the Monk! Angela He bears the form of one just dead with him! What can it mean? (Enter Francisco bearing Madalena in his arms.) Say, brother, who is this? Monk Our daughter Madalena! Angela Then she's found! Where found you her? Monk Back at her father's house. Angela How came she in this fix? Monk Grief for his absence. Angela (to Madalena) Alas! can you not stand alone? Madalena (recovering) Alone! Angela You are with usâwe are your friends. Madalena Fernando! thou wilt come againâI know Thou wilt! Angela Why talk you of Fernando, child? Madalena I should have been his wife. Angela His wife! Madalena His wifeâ His wedded wife! Monk (to Angela) Well, that is strange! for he Came recommended to the king from her. Angela Your father left you in our careâwe are Your friends. Madalena I have no father! Monk Mark you that! Angela What! know you not the tutoress of your youth? Madalena I would if she were here. Angela Is she not here? Is Angela Di Pianneza not The Tutoress of your youth? Madalena She was to be My mother, but Fernando now is gone! Angela Fernando gone? what mean you by these words? Fernando is not gone! Monk I saw him goâ He went with Stuart to the war. Angela My son? Monk Thy very son. Angela Then I am sad indeed! It cannot be! Fernando is not gone! You may have been mistaken in the boy! Monk I am mistaken, then, that you are here; That now the Princess is before thine eyes; That we have never spoken of this thing; And that we are not wondering while we speak! Angela Are you not Madalena? speak to me! Madalena That is my name. Angela (to Monk.) Look! do you know that face? Monk 'Tis Madalena's face! You are most strange! Angela It is most strange! The more we see of her, The more we wish to see, which, seeing, makes Us only see the less! Madalena Go, bring him back! Monk Are you not certain that you heard that voice? Angela It is most strange! Fernando is not gone! Madalena (springing on her feet) Has he returned? Who was it spoke that word? Angela His motherâthine. Madalena (Embracing her) Oh! bless thee for that word! Monk Are you not certain that you heard that voice? Angela I am most certain that she speaks most strange! Have you no father, Madalena? Madalena None! A father had not left me so alone Angela Thy father, child, has left us all alone! But go, Francesco, speed it quick to Rome, And bring me back my son! Away! begone! Monk If laying down my life will ravel out This mystery, it shall be done. Farewell! Angela And be it known to all, that from this day, The Convent gate shall not be opened till You come again. Farewell! Monk Farewell, my child! Madalena Farewell, good father! take my heart with you, And give it to Fernando! Fare-thee-well! (Exit Francisco as the curtain falls.) End of Act First Act II Scene I (Boradale in Scotland. Enter Charles Stuart attended by his daughter Madalena disguised as a Page.) Charles Stuart Come hither, gentle Page! Thou hast become As necessary to my being as my life. I have despaired of that success which Hope First promised me for active war! Page Why so, My royal lord? Charles Stuart I have received no news From France in answer to my letter yet. Page Nay, do not doubt while young Fernando lives, But Stuart shall be seated on the throne. I pray you that your boy should learn to fence. Charles Stuart To fence, my boy? why do you wish to fence? Page For glory good my lord! while on the field What ecstasy would young Fernando feel To know that he had saved his Master's life? For know, my royal lord! that this proud heart Shall first receive the dagger aimed at thine. Charles Stuart Enthusiastic boy! why say you so! Page Because you are so doubly dear to me, That were you slain, this life would not be life! Charles Stuart Thou art the noblest of all gentle youths. And shall not find an equal in this land. (Enter Boisdale.) Well, noble Boisdale, what is the news? Boisdale None that your highness would delight to hear. The battle of Fontenoy has been fought; And news arrived the English troops were much Depressed. Charles Stuart Their ardour, therefore, being damped, Without assistance from ungodly France, Could we not safely march our Highland troops, And take possession of the field? Boisdale Such would Be useless in the worst extreme. Without The regular troops not one will take up arms. Charles Stuart The ardour of my resolution keeps The better of my judgement, Boisdale! Where is Clanranald? He will better suit A Stuart's intrepidity. Boisdale He will Not come. Charles Stuart Why speak you thus? Boisdale He will not take Up arms without the regular troops to lead. Charles Stuart Will you not use your power to bring him here? Boisdale I have no influence over him, my lord. Charles Stuart Wilt not become ambassador to Skye To brave Macdonald? Boisdale No, 'tis vain. Page (Indignantly) Implore no more that traitor to his king, my lord, And let us seek Macdonald for ourselves. Boisdale (Drawing) What! traitor, did you say? By heavens! But no! I will not vent my spite upon a child! What! did you bring such soldiers as this boy To fight with hardy England? No, by Heaven! He looks as if you had just taken him from His mother's breast! The suckling shall be spared! Page What! traitor! weakly as you think I am, This arm is strong enough for thee! (Drawing) Come on! And see who is the suckling, you or I! I pity thee. I spurn thee from my sight. The presence of all honest men should freeze Thy coward heart to ice! Away! begone! Boisdale By Heaven! You shall not taunt me thus! Page Come on! Charles Stuart (Stepping between them) Nay, peace! young man! You, Boisdale, put up Your sword! The royal Charles commands you both. And you, young Page. (Exit Boisdale.) Page (Falling on his knees.) Nay, pardon me, my lord! A traitor's insolence provoked my rage! I had forgot the duty which I owed Thy former love! Pray, pardon me, my lord! Charles Stuart (Eagerly taking his hand) Look up, my noble boy! Look up, my noble son! And tell me, more than mortal, who thou art! Page I am, my royal lordâ Charles Say what thou art? For by yon Heaven thou art the sun. Page That which I glory in, the favourite of my Prince. Charles Stuart (Studying his features) A chastened smile dwells on thy sweet lips. As if thy soul, just purified by love Gazed on the snowy wings of virgin Hope, Leading it gently to the gates of Heaven! But rise, my gentle Page! some person comes. (Enter Sir Ronald) What news from France? Sir Ronald I come to learn the news. For, hearing that our royal Prince was here, We come to give him welcome to our shores. Charles Stuart Who? Sir Ronald Moidart, Clanranald. Charles Stuart Moidart, Clanranald? Show me this moment to my friends. Sir Ronald They come. (Enter Moidart and Clanranald.) Charles Stuart My noble friends! Why have you thus delayed Your presence from your king? Clanranald My lord! we heard That you had come without your regular troops, And well we know the Highlanders would not Take arms without the regular troops to lead. Charles Stuart And are you sure they will not take up arms? Clanranald I know they will not. If they should, it would Be instant deathâdestruction to them all! Charles Stuart Is this the common cry throughout the land? The seed of cowardice is sown therein, And shall be watered by the bravest blood! Who would not rather die than live such men! Oh, for another heart just like my own, We two would cling together through the fight, And live to conquer England or die! Page Here is another heart as brave as thine; It tolls the knell of bondage on my ribs, And swells my bosom with an eager throb, As if upon the vigil-pants it bore The form of Victory triumphant, air To Liberty! Here is another heart like thine. Charles Stuart Take an example from that arduous youth Whose nature is too gentle even to bear The simplest frown, but whose undaunted soul Is like the eagle when he plumes his wings, And straightway soars up to the sun! That which is glory unto him, as is The sunbeam to the eagle, makes ye blind, And fills your puny hearts with gaudy fears, Which magnify the more you gaze on them! Would you not rather die than live to see The fathers that have bred you, slaves? Ronald We would. Page (Embracing Sir Ronald.) Behold that gallant youth! See how his eyes Sparkle with glory at the very thought! See how his mighty soul speaks through his cheeks, Although his lips are mute! Will ye not die? Ronald A thousand death if but my royal lord Will make me his companion in the tour. Charles Stuart Oh! for another heart just like my own Thrice would we then be armed against the foe. Page Fernando has another heart like his, One that will lose the last drop in his wars, Or seat his Royal Master on the throne. Charles Stuart Undaunted youth! with such brave hearts as thine What should we fear from England's bravest sons? Ye shall be leaders of the Highland troops; And when the victory shall be won, ye shall Be both as near my throne as now my heart. Clanranald Noble Prince! we are constrained to go. Thus shall we all be mingled into one, And melt the tyrant-chaos, as the sun Dispels the darkness of the night, until The world is wrapped in one continuous glow! Page Friend of my soul! we are but one at heart! Sir Ronald We are but one at heart, as thou hast said; But we shall be like three upon the field The valor of my heart has echoed thine And Scotland's warriour shall unite his soul In deathless friendship to the child of Song. Thus, as our hearts are here united, so Shall be our hands in rosy bands of love! Page Remember, thou hast spoken what may be Sir Ronald It may not be what is already done. Page I call upon my royal liege, from this time forth, And these two friends to witness what is said. Sir Ronald And would you doubt the truth of Ronald thus? Page I would not doubt it. Sir Ronald Then it shall be so. (Enter Marquis de Tullibardine, Sir Joshua Macdonald, Cameron, Buchanan, Lochiel and Timlock.) Charles Stuart Welcome, my noble friends! What news from France? Macdonald We still hear nothing from the troops, my lord! Charles Stuart If some vile serpent had but stung thy child, Whose death were antidote to that keen bite, Would you not kill it? Macdonald Ay, for joy, my lord. Charles Stuart Thou wouldst not long for its destruction more Than Stuart for that serpent who now sits Arrayed on England's throne. Macdonald Then let him die! Charles Stuart He who has driven the fiery wheels of war Above the battlements of exiled Kings, Shall, by thunderbolts of Stuart's power, Amid the whirlwinds of protracted war, Behold his glory leveled with the dust! The Owl shall mutter his dolorous notes Above the wailings of her recent chiefs, And Stuart's faithful followers shall reap, The garnished glories of her wasted kings And gather up their spoils for household gods, While their unwilling recreants shall behold The fire of Liberty, rekindled, burn Upon the Altar of our isle, new built A quenchless beacon light for after times; And dart athwart the pestilential gloom Of Tyranny the lucid beams of truth, And usher in that glorious morn of peace, Whose rising on the world shall never set. Sir Ronald Thy spirit-stirring eloquence of Fame Shall guide our barque of glory through the sea, And stay the tides of Tyranny. No warriours' heart Wrung by humanity, shall pour the balm Of memory over their deserted names; These and the magic wreath which gems the brow Of Charles shall fall the freshening dews of fame, And yield its blossoms an eternal youth. Macdonald No power could urge the grateful tear to fall Upon the prostrate form of Tyranny, Stretched on the opprobrious earth in shame! Sir Ronald No, lest that tear should water it with life, Lock up the fountains of the grateful heart, And save it for affection's flower, whose life Depends upon the dew drops of the soul. Charles Stuart The rich barbaric infidel no more Shall bruise with hostile feet the tender flower Of Caledonia's isleânor shall her vales Be trodden by the feet of would-be kings; For when the vengeance of my noble house, Shall give the shock of centuries to this, The fragments caused by my revenge shall lie In shattered desolation over all. The land from which they exiled me, as wrecks Of naval myrmadons on savage shoresâ More silent in their desolation than The last sad wails of Israel hushed to rest In everlasting silence, or the voice Of Wo struck dumb forever! For liberty has no objective beingâ It stands eternal in the will of God, To lift our being up to noble ends; It is evolved by instinct from the soul, And lives immortal as itself in thought. Sir Ronald 'Tis like the idea we have of God, An everlasting law unto itself, Which triumphs over Tyranny as Life Does over Death. Charles Stuart For as man dies to live, So Liberty, when seeming dead, survives. Macdonald Thy words are all prophetic of the truths Which soon shall be And we will learn to conquer or to die! (Exeunt omnes.) Scene II (The residence of Cameron of Fassafern. Enter Lochiel to Boisdale.) Boisdale Good morning, Lochiel! for the morn is good, Although the times are bad. What is the news? Lochiel The King is here. Boisdale He is. Where go you now? Lochiel To seek my Prince. Boisdale Well, you had better stay. Seek not the Prince, let him return to France. Lochiel For this he should be sought. Why urge me thus? Boisdale I urge you, knowing that his cause is vain. Lochiel I would persuade him to return to France. Boisdale But he will not return. Lochiel How know you this? Boisdale I know it by my knowledge of the man. Lochiel Saw you the scorn that sat enthroned upon His florid lips? Boisdale I saw his scornâno more of that. Lochiel I never shall forget his looks. Boisdale Nor I. Lochiel Decision sat enthroned upon his brow In awful dignity. Upon his lips A writhing scorn triumphant played, as if In concert with an agony within, That restless grew for something to devour. He is the shadow of some mighty godâ Nay, if the very gods were on the earth, They would not be more like themselves, than is This royal Charles. Boisdale Most noble trumpeter! You are no fit companion for this god. Lochiel What mean you by this taunt? Boisdale I mean, you are No fit companion for a god. Lochiel Your praise Tastes bitter as 'tis sweetâyour honey much Like gallâyour love like hate. Boisdale I hate him? Yesâ But saw you that young god he has with him? Lochiel The Child of Song? Boisdale The Child of Hell! Lochiel This Page? Boisdale AyâPage! He is a Pageâa twelve mo. pageâ A diamond cheap Edition bound in calf! An excellent impudence! Lochiel The type is small, Although you seem to read it well. Boisdale And such A Page I hope never to read again. Lochiel Why? Did he hurt your eyes? Boisdale He was too smallâ I scarcely saw the print! Lochiel And yet it seems He left the print. Boisdale Of what? Lochiel Not of his sword, My lord! but of his Page. Boisdale He is too small For my perusal. Printed thus, he is A bijou Almanac in which his lord May read his own eclipse! Lochiel When next you read This Page, put on your spectacles. Boisdale I will. And magnifying glasses they shall be. Lochiel You cannot magnify his worthâhe fills The boundless heaven of admiration Boisdale Ay! He has the impudence to think he does, As many other men. Lochiel You hate the king, And hating him, you hate the Page. Your hate For one should not affect the other's worth. Boisdale I hate the Page? He is beneath my hate! Lochiel Why does his praise taste bitter to thy tongue? Boisdale Because he is a crabâtastes sour in spite Of me. Lochiel But then the King is not a crabâ Why does he taste so bitter to thy tongue? Boisdale Because his heart is rotten to the core. Lochiel But then he tastes most sweet to Flora's lips. Boisdale To Flora's lips! No, by God's Heavens! were she To taste such fruit, her soul would sink as far From its original brightness, as did first The mother of transgression at the fall! Lochiel And, like that mother, though she knew she'd die, Yet would she eat the fruit. Boisdale No, by the gods! Until the Serpent tempted herâthen would She fall as low as Hell's from Heaven! Lochiel Not by The King. Boisdale Ay, King! of what? Lochiel Of theeâof me. Boisdale He may be King of theeâbut not of me! Lochiel Should I report to him what I have heard, You would not live an hour! Boisdale I have no life! My lips went with my honor! Yes, my life Is gone! Spurned by a boyâscorned by the kingâ No! vengeance shall be mine! Lochiel You are in love? Boisdale I love to hate thy King! Lochiel Art jealous, man? Boisdale If Royalty could win her heart, she might Be won. Lochiel If Royalty could win her heart, The sooner won the better. Boisdale He might win Her fancyânot her heart. Lochiel Nay, if she loved No Royalty could win her heart. Boisdale Well, well, I know you better than you do yourselfâ Seek not the King. Lochiel Why so? Boisdale You love the king? Lochiel With all my heart! Boisdale Where is thy love for me? Lochiel Love is immortal, simple, pure, divine; And, to divide is not to take away. Boisdale Well, well, tomorrow we shall meet again. Lochiel Farewell! (Exit.) Boisdale He called me traitorâtraitor to his King, And all because I would not bow to him! No, Boisdale will never bow to himâ Not while Eternity shall roll its sounds! Greatness does not depend upon the things Eternalâchance, or fortune, wealth, or fame; But builds its temple in the mighty soulâ Looks on the towering front of giant Time And sways its scepter o'er the menial earth. (Exit.) Scene III (The interior of the park in front of Macdonald's Palace. Enter Charles Stuart to Flora Macdonald.) Charles Stuart Oh! how upon the impatience of my ears, Fall the soft billowy bounding of thy steps, As if an angel from some glorious sphere, Walked in the middle watch of still night, Beneath the vigils of the moon in search Of some immortal soul lost in the bowers! Flora The gentle firstborn of the flowery spring, That knows no handling but the zephyr's kiss, If once transplanted from its native bower, Will droop beneath the culture of the hand. There is no city love. Give me the pure Felicity of cottage life, or noneâ The joyous laugh, that mocking-bird of youth, Singing of childhood's holy happiness From the deep willings of the living soul, Here, where the unsealed fulness of my heart Rings its loud shout of jocund joy to Heaven, And fills the infinite with melody! Charles Stuart Oh, thou art bound to me by all the ties Of earthâcemented by the seal of heaven! This gives me double duties to perform, To keep the flower unsullied here on earth, And make it yield its perfumes to heaven, The sweetest flower in Caledonia's isle. I am alive to newer longings now, What is adversity to hearts most brave, Since thou hast smiled upon my cause, but food For my ambitious soul! Flora I smile for him Whose glory shall contend with after-time For Immortality. Charles Stuart Most glorious queen! Thy words are to my heart like crystal streams To their own banks adorned with odorous flowers. To give all that we have to one we love, Is not to lose. Flora But 'tis to make both rich. Charles Stuart For we profess not only what we give, But her we give it to. Flora And thus it is, That two, by keeping what they have, have naught, Till they exchange, when each has made both rich. Charles Stuart For to profess that which we have is not To have, if we exchange not to be rich. Flora So if we give to each what each one has, We shall profess what both united have. Charles Stuart How different from the bargains of this world. It is not so in aught but love. Flora In naught. (Enter Boisdale, unobserved, behind them.) To take from love is not to make it less. Boisdale (Aside) What! making love? Fine business for a King! This is the god that Lochiel told me of! The King that drove me from his Page! By Heavens! I would not have believed it from her lips! Were I to take him from her arms, would there Not be one less! There would. Thine is a false Philosophy, my love! (Charles Stuart takes her hand.) By Heavens! he takes her hand! Oh! all ye thunderbolts of Heaven! Come, strike Me dead! Flora Heard you not what I said, my lord? Boisdale (Aside) My lord! Charles Stuart I did, my love. Boisdale (Aside) And so did I, My love! I never will trust woman more! Charles Stuart Thy voice is echoing in my soul. Boisdale (aside) And mine. Like seven loud thunders ruinous! Flora Come my lord! Boisdale (Aside) By heavens! she beckons him away! (They start away hand in hand.) False! false! Charles Stuart (Leading her out) The sweetest flower in Caledonia's isle! Boisdale Oh, God! she was the green oasis in The dead alion of my soul! But no, I will not curse her. Memory plucks away The execration from my burning lips, And sets forgiveness there! But she is false, False as a harlot's oath. Yes, false as Hell! And had he now ten thousand lives to loseâ For I would kill them allâthey would not pay Me for the injury he has done! No! no! The fiery retribution of my hate Is so intense that nothing but his blood, His cursed blood, shall ever quench its flame! (Exit) End of Act Second Act III [Scene I] (Ormaclade. Macdonald's residence in the background. Enter Sir Ronald and Madalena as Page.) Sir Ronald But tell me, gentle Page! how is thy hand? I would that it were well, we lack thy songs, The soul-inspiring music of thy harp, But more, the pleasing sadness of thy voice. Page I would forego the pleasures of my harp, To know that they are masters of the day. Sir Ronald They are, as you desire, the masters of the day. They nobly routed all their foes. Page We live! But are you sure that we will conquer? Sir Ronald Yes, Unless the sightless Chariot of Fate Should drive his iron wheels above our hopes, And crush the life blood from our royal Charles! As if the eternal thunder rolled above The fragments of dissolving empire! Page Shout! And let the caverns of the mighty earth Reverberate the loud acclaim! Shout! shout! And make the echoes of our joyful hearts The knell of England's destiny! Sir Ronald The Chiefs Are shouting now upon the far-off hills, Until the mighty mountains echo back Their thunderbolts of vengeance on the foe! Soon shall the mighty arm of royal Charles Unsheathe the blazing sword, whose edge shall cut The adamantine chains of Tyranny. For now they cry aloud for Scotland's King, While we stand here debating how they fought. (Enter Francisco, the Monk, who gazes intently at the Page, who, seeing him, falls in Sir Ronald's arms.) Page Come, quick! away from this! my heart is sick! Sir Ronald For Heaven's sweet sake, Fernando, speak! what is The matter? What could thus have harmed you so? Page (The Monk passes on slowly) There, nothing now, Sir Ronald, give me air. Sir Ronald I pray you, tell me what it is? (The Monk passes out) Page (Recovering) There, now, 'Tis nothing now. I am most well again. (He fixes his eyes upon the ground, as if absorbed in thought.) Sir Ronald But why do you thus gaze at nothing so, As if you were absorbed in your own thoughts? Methinks you are unwell. Page No, not at all. I was just thinking of that beauteous girl, The lovely Madalena. Sir Ronald What of her? Page I thought how purely beautiful she looked, As softly radiant as the peaceful Heaven, When first aurora comes with rosy smiles, To ope the portals of the dappled East, And lead the morning forth to light the world. Sir Ronald Who is the lovely Madalena, Page? Page She is the royal Prince's only child. Sir Ronald Ah! Young Fernando! are you sure in love? Is that the cause of thy sad countenance? Where is she now? Come, tell me where she is? Page Ah! if you had beheld her dark bright eyes, When we were doomed to part, suffused with tears! Sir Ronald But why not tell me where she is? Page She isâ Her father left her at the conventâwith My mother Angelica. Would she were here. Sir Ronald But say, Fernando, are you not in love? Come, do not say it is not so, you are! These fainting fits are symptoms of such things. Page And then, Sir Ronald, you have been in love? Sir Ronald I would be, were you not now in the way. Methinks, from what you have just said, that she Was formed to be the partner of my joys. Why change, as if you had entire control Of her? Page I have more right than you may think. But is it true that you could love that girl? Sir Ronald Why ask so oft? Are you not jealous, boy? Page I would be jealous were you now in love With any one beside, but you are not? Sir Ronald Most fascinating boy! were you but now A woman, beautiful as now thou art, I would prefer thee to the world. Page And were Fernando any thing but what he is, He would prefer Sir Ronald to the world. Sir Ronald Methinks, one smile would win me from the war And make me subject unto her alone. Page Well, you acknowledge your allegiance soon, For she is heiress to the Scottish throne. Sir Ronald The Mirandolean Minstrel then can stand But little chance. Page True, did you ever know A Princess marry with her father's Page? Sir Ronald I never did. Page Then why retrive the day In love. Sir Ronald I only asked if it were so. You may have been in love with her, without Her absolutely being so with you, For if my eyes do not deceive me, as I do profess to be some sort of judge In matters of this kind, you are in love. Page Indeed, Sir Ronald, you astonish me! Sir Ronald Most persons are astonished why they love. Page Then you have been astonished in that way? Comeâno prevaricationâspeak the truth. Sir Ronald Indeed you need not urge me to confess. But should we thus marvel at such things? I love the royal Stuart as my life; And would, to shield him from the foe, rush in And sheathe the dagger that was aimed at him, In my own heart. Page (Embracing him) Friend of my raptured soul! Sir Ronald From henceforth let the Highland Chieftain's heart Be mingled with the Mirandolean boy's. Page And feel for him what now he feels for thee? Or what the Princess Madalena yet May feel for thee? Sir Ronald Ay, were thou both combined, But are you not in love with her. Page I am; But not affianced to her any more Than unto you, or any one beside. What if we should behold her here tonight? Sir Ronald What would Fernando say? Page Why, I should say That she was worthy to be made thy wife, Or even an heir to Scotland's throne. Sir Ronald But Ronald never can be hers. Page Why not? Sir Ronald He is too lowly born. Page Too lowly born! A Highlander too low? Were you not born Upon the hills? Sir Ronald I wasâupon the mountains top. Page Then let your soul be like your birth nigh Heaven. You are the Eagleâshe the faithful Dove. Sir Ronald My tongue is bankrupt for sufficient words To give the praise. Page Nay, keep them to bestow On her, who is to be thy wedded wife, The royal daughter of the godlike Charles. Sir Ronald Ah, sweet Fernando, if it could be so, The love-sick Ronald would forget the war. Page It will, if young Fernando have his way. Sir Ronald And you have known her from her infancy? Page I have. She was the playmate of my youth. Sir Ronald I loved the royal Prince beforeâbut now, I feel endeared to him by stronger ties. Page Then will you promise me one thing? Sir Ronald I will, Fernando, promise anything. Page Perform What you may promise? Sir Ronald Ay, indeed I will. Page Then, swear that you will never wed, except The royal Madalena. Sir Ronald What if she Be ugly? Page She is most beautiful Yet, gentler than the gentlest of her sex. Sir Ronald But what if she will have me not? Page She will. Sir Ronald I swear! But wherefor do you ask me thus? Page It is enough that you have sworn. Come on, The royal Madalena shall be thing. (Exeunt) Scene II (A splendid apartment in Macdonald's palace at Kinnclade. Enter Charles Stuart to Lochiel.) Charles Stuart Welcome, my noble Chieftain! What's the news? Lochiel No news, my noble lord, from France as yet. Charles Stuart I recently dispatched new messengers To those from whom one might expect some aid; But they have not returned. Lochiel They have, my lord. I read the message of your strange desire To lead the Highland troops directly on The field. Charles Stuart And doubt you the propriety Of such a measure now? Lochiel I do, my lord, The enterprise is pregnant with much danger. Charles Stuart Why say you so? This is the common right. No, as the hound will eager cry, pursue, Through woody vistas all unknown, the hart, And thus more ardently in the chase, So does my soul pant for the war! Lochiel But as that hound, still crying in the chase, Pursues with eager hopelessness the hart Till, by the swifter game left farther in The war, his cries are lost among the woods; So will the eager heart of godlike Charles Pursue the unreached boon of his desire, Through fame's dark vistas till forever lost! Charles Stuart No; with the Blast-hound-Furies of the hills, A few brave Highlanders, we will put The Royal Standard in the front of war, And show usurping Brunswick to his face, That Stuart comes to claim his father's crown! Though we are few, yet we shall win the field, Or perish in the attempt! So, curb me not! Auld Lochiel, whom my father ever thought brave, Nay, from the papers learn, while housed at home, The fate of Stuart's House. Lochiel No, though the attempt. To vanquish England's host be more than vain, Yet every rebel over whom my sword Can have control, shall take up arms for thee, And Lochiel meet whatever fate may now Await his royal Charles. Charles Stuart Then seek at once The Highland chiefsâtell them their king is hereâ And longs to lead them to the battle field. Lochiel I go. To do your bidding, but before we part, Should they accompany the regular troops? Without assistance from some other source, It will be most disastrous to our cause. Charles Stuart No; Justice, Honor, Dignity, are on our side, And where such triune glories wait our steps, And beckon us to fameâwhy talk of doubt? Lochiel Whatever be Charles Stuart's fate, the same Be Lochiel's destiny. Charles Stuart There seek the Chiefs, And learn when we shall meet them on the field (Exit Lochiel.) (Enter Page) Come hither, Page. Come near to me. Can you Not see in my sad countenance the stars Of joys that have been written there of late? Page I think there is not aught of what you speak; But rather marks of recent grief. Charles Stuart 'Tis strange! And know you not that there are things which seem To be, but yet are not? Page It may be so, But yet Fernando never saw such things. Charles Stuart And think you not that one, by gazing on Some face resembling that she loves, might see The image of that loved one in that face? Page A smile might linger on the face of one, In faint resemblance of the one away, For there are faces so resembling each That persons have mistaken them for such, And would not be convinced they were not so. Charles Stuart Thus, in the outlines of thy beauteous face, I now behold the countenance of oneâ Page Nay, nay, my lord! There is no truth in this, (A knock is heard) Charles Stuart Whose knock is that? Go see. Page I will, my lord. (Exit Page.) Charles Stuart A nobler being never lived! (Reenter Page.) Page My lord! Charles Stuart Why turn so pale? Page (Much agitated) Our holy father craves Admittance. (Aside) Gods! what shall be done? Charles Stuart How now! What means this strange reaction? Speak! thy face Is pale as death! What means it, boy? thou'st ill? Page I am not ill, my lord. Charles Stuart Why turn so pale? Page (Aside) Gods! is it possible the Monk is here? (Enter Francisco, the Monk) Charles Stuart What means this sudden entrance? speak, my friend! How is my child? my Madalena? well? Monk I trust she is, my lord. Charles Stuart Speak outâthe truth? If she be dead or dying, tell me so! Monk She is not dead, my lord. Charles Stuart I thank high Heavens That she is well! Page She is, my lord, she is Most well. Charles Stuart Then what mishap has brought thee here? Monk I dare not tell it to Fernando's ears. I fear the sudden news would drive him mad! Charles Stuart (Aside) It cannot be that Angela is dead! Page Nay, if my mother Angela were dead, I yet could bear that tooâfor all must die! Charles Stuart Great Heavens! if she is dead, what will become Of Madalena? Speak, old Monk! Monk I trust She is not dead. Charles Stuart Then why to Scotland come? Monk I came to soothe the grief of Angela, And seek Fernando. Page Seek Fernando? why? Monk For Madalena's sake. Charles Stuart What! say you so? Are you not tampering with the lion, Monk, To baffle me this way? Speak what you know, Or, by yon Heavens! Monk Nay, hold, my lord! you should Not strike your friend! Charles Stuart Then tell me why you came? Monk For that lost boy, for whom his mother mourns. Page And is that all? Monk (Aside) Not moved? no tears are shed? Ungrateful boy! you little know the pangs That rend thy mother's heart! Page Why should she grieve? Charles Stuart Upbraid him not, he is of noble stuff, And worthy to ascend the throne. Monk Nay, he Is fitter for an outcast than the throne. I fear that Angela has spoken truth! Page What should she speak but truth? Monk What! still unmoved! Thou dost develope none of her good traits, Though it was said thou didst inherit all. I blush to see the golden ore of love Transmuted by the Alchemy of Fame To such base stuff! you little know the pangs That Madalena feels for thee! Charles Stuart For thee! It cannot be! it is impossible! Page It is Impossible, so get you gone, old Monk! Monk Ah! had you seen the agonies which rent Her royal heart! Charles Stuart The agonies? It must Be so, Fernando! Speak, old Monk! Monk And speaking, shall command Fernando's tears With words more powerful than kingly speech. Charles Stuart Then you have spoken falsehood all this while? Monk Naught but the living truth, my lord. Page 'Tis true. My royal lordâshe is not dead. Charles Stuart Away, Fernando, I must have the truth! Page My lord, Did ever thy Fernando play thee false? Charles Stuart No, never in thy life. Page Then, doubt him notâ For may this right arm wither to its joints, If what Fernando says is not the truth. I tell thee, Madalena is not dead, But all that she has ever been, shall be To thee again. Charles Stuart How know you this, my boy? Page It shall all be explained, but after this. Charles Stuart Most noble boy! I could not blame her if She loved, for no one ever saw thy face Who did not love, except this heartless Monk. Monk I love him and for his mother's sake, Who bade me watch above him as my own. Page Nay, watch above yourself, you need it more. I am Fernando, royal Charles' Page, And will be watched by no one but himself. Monk I though you were of tender mould, And would be melted by the simplest grief, But now you are more tearless at the heart Than is the sightless stoic of the woods. Page As Angela di Pianneza's son, I weep, but as the royal Charles' Page, I deem it meet to smile. Goodbye, old Monk. (turning indignantly away.) Charles Stuart Most noble boy! Where are thy tears, old Monk? Monk Ah! had thine eyes beheld what mine have seen, Thy heart, like mine, had been dissolved to tears! Page (Returning) Thy Madalena lives. Charles Stuart I know she does. Farewell, old Monk! Page (Tauntingly) Goodbye, old Monk! goodbye! (Exeunt Charles Stuart and Page.) Monk Good heavens! was ever mortal so beguiled! I will pursue him to the very last. (Exit.) Scene II (The interior of Macdonald's Park at Ormaclade. His residence in the distance. Enter Lochiel to Boisdale.) Boisdale Lochiel, I tell thee, Lochiel, I have seen A sight! Lochiel A sight, my lord? Boisdale A sight, my lord! A cursed, damned, loathesome sight! Lochiel A ghost, My lord? Boisdale No ghost, my lord! No ghost, or if It be a ghost, a ghost in princely robes, On whose Medean folds a villan's heart To desolation burns! Lochiel What can he mean? Boisdale You are a hypocrite? Lochiel (Drawing) A hypocrite? By heavens! Boisdale Put up your sword. I will not fight with thee. I have reserved my steel for other blood. Lochiel You called my hypocrite? Boisdale I did, you are. Lochiel I say you lie. Boisdale I care not what you say; You could not make me fight you, did you call Me traitor, liar, thief, or what you please. Lochiel You called me hypocrite. Boisdale I did, you are. I thought so once, but now I know you are. Lochiel By heavens! you shall not taunt me thus. Defend Thyself! Boisdale Put up your sword. I will not fight With thee. Lochiel Then take that for your insolence. (Striking him.) Boisdale The day will come when you shall howl for this, Howl like a beaten hound! Put up your sword. Lochiel A coward, by my soul! Boisdale You know that, else You had not acted so. Lochiel Recall your words, Or, by heavens, you shall not live for them! Boisdale I shall not die by you. Lochiel You could not die By better hands. Boisdale When I do die, it shall Be by what you consider better hands. Lochiel (Putting up his sword) Come home, my sword, he is no work for thee. Boisdale There are two things on earth I love to hate. Lochiel What things are these? Boisdale A serpent and a goose. Lochiel What does he mean? The man has lost his wits. Boisdale Why should I keep my wits when all that made My wits is gone? Lochiel What have you lost? Boisdale The world, The riches of Peru, Golconda's mines. Not all the bankrupt jewels of the earth Could buy me back that precious gem again. Lochiel What have you lost? I pray you tell me now. Boisdale A gem more costly than the stars, from whose Bright beams the abject world drank living light! Should he not die? Lochiel What frantic mood is this? Boisdale It is no frantic mood, 'tis truth most trueâ And, being truth, what frantic mood so sane? Lochiel You are abused, or maddened; which to guess, I do not know. Boisdale I am abused, which heaven Doth truly know, and madness follows next. Lochiel Who has abused you thus? Boisdale Were you my friend, You would not ask. I have no tongue to tell. A thousand tongues were dumb to give it better! Lochiel I shall despair to know your grief. Boisdale You would Despair to know such grief. Locheil What? is there no Relief? Boisdale Give medicine to a dying man; A straw to one fast drowning in the sea; A sound to him who has no ear to hear; A taste to him who has no tongue to eat; A sight to him who has no eyes to see; And each will sooner live, hear, taste and see, Than Boisdale will find relief! Lochiel Alas! Are you not angry with the king? Boisdale Why ask? To be the herald of my hate? Lochiel Thy hatred, What cares he for thy hate? Boisdale It is a man's! Lochiel He has been hated by brave men before Today. Boisdale I do not wonder that he has, My only wonder is, he lives! Lochiel He lives, And likely long to live. Boisdale Art sure of that? Lochiel I know it by my knowledge of the man. Boisdale Say rather that you wish it in your love. Lochiel You would not like the king? Boisdale Oh no, I would Not kill himâgive him to the dogs, the wolves, The hounds of hell! 'Twere merciful to kill The king! Lochiel Your power is great if measured by Your words Boisdale They are the symbols of that power! The measure of that soul-subduing power Which never sleeps! 'Tis on the vigil now, And waits the prowling of that cursed wolf, Who robbed me of the sweetest lamb on earth, Took from my Paradise the sweetest flower That ever bloomed! Lochiel Poor Boisdale, you are In love. Boisdale In love with one who loves me not. Who was the spring-tide of my life, my soul-love, Whose smiles were beacons to the Land of Joy, Whose blue-eyed beauty beckoned me to come, And drink contentment from the cup of Bliss. Lochiel Forget her, man; forget her, let her go. Boisdale A base, abandoned profligate, to steal The only joy I had on earth. Oh, God! And does that villan live who robbed me thus? Ay! revels in the joys that once were mine. Oh, could his life-blood quench my agony, It were oblivion to my soul indeed! But I was lowly born, a cottage is My home. But there is in my heart a pride As lofty as a monarch owns. It is Not on the throne that Nature owns her sway. The straw-thatched cottage, where dwells poverty In mean attire, may hold a heart as great As that within a Monarch's heart. Then why, Before th' illusive shadows of rich pomp, Should simple dignity bow down? It shall Not be! no, by yon Heavens, it shall not be! Lochiel Come, Boisdale, be calm again. Boisdale Alas, A crushed affection has no balm on earth. My soul is plundered of its richest wealth, And all the merchandise of earth is naught! Lochiel I know no remedy for ills like thine. Boisdale An aspirant for Heaven, when on The threshold of the spies, was not more pure. A holier vision never met the eyes! But now, compared with what she was, as Hell To Heaven! Where is that heavenly beauty now? The benedictions of whose love fell on My soul like dew drops on the tender flowers, Making my heart a paradise of joys. Her brook-like voice ran through my thirsting soul, Like silver waters over golden sands. Lochiel Become the subject of the king, and you Shall hear that voice again. Boisdale No, Lochiel, no! For misery's climax will delight to that. I could not bear to gaze upon those eyes, Two liquid heavens reflecting love, that face, From whose sweet smile my soul drank living lightâ And she another's! No, it cannot be. Lochiel I pity thee! But we must part. Farewell! Boisdale Farewell! (Exit Lochiel.) Now for the king again! Tonight! An ague-like revenge chills through my soul, And makes distraction in my heart. Tonight! (Exit.) Scene III (The same apartment in Macdonald's palace at Ormaclade. Flora is seated by a table binding a bouquet of flowers.) Flora Ah! he will love me, when I give him this. A flowery book, whose words of different flowers, Shall tell him in one volume all my heart. Ah! how the rose's velvet lips shall speak, And tell him with mute eloquence my love, Nature's interpreter of God to man. Ye are the alphabet by which we read The poetry of love. An angel's hand First scattered you on earth that ye might be A symbol of the heart that cannot speak. Ye are the perfumed lips by which we speak A language innocent as pureâas free From guile as this fond heart which owns you now. I breathe upon you now, that when he takes Your fragrance in, he may inhale my sighs. (Enter Boisdale) Boisdale Now she is here alone, could I not save Her from the king? Oh, how my heart burns in My heart! Two mighty kings, Love and Despair, Reign in my heart each subject unto each, Not knowing which is mightiest! How she smiles! A loveliness sits on her lofty brow, Like beauty on an ivory throne. She fills The atmosphere around with living light, It clothes the sinuous sweetness of her limbs, Like that around an angel's form as when The seasons smiled on Venus when she rose Up from the sea. I feel new life run through My heart, as when some flower disported by The summer south, unfolds its fragrant leaves To kiss the god of day! How mild she seems! I have grown jealous of the very air, Lest it should bear away some smile unseen. I will not beâno, I will speak to her. (Approaching her and kneeling) Most beauteous Flora! Angel of my heart! Flora (Rising) What! Boisdale? Boisdale By name but that alone! Flora Why do you kneel? Boisdale A worshiper should kneel. Flora You are too kind. Boisdale Why look upon me thus? Flora Then I will turn my eyes away. Boisdale No, no. Then it were dark again. Flora Why talk you thus? Boisdale My love is like eternity. It bends Above thee like the Heavens. It hovers o'er My spirit like an Angel's wings! Thou art My sun, the center of that heaven. Without Thy light my heaven is dark! Flora You are too kind. Are there not other lights? Boisdale There is but one Bright Cynossure; she gazes on me now, The queen of my soul's heaven. Flora But when that star Is set, you will forget that it has shone, To see the real shine bright. Boisdale Thou art no star; Thou art the moon, the satellite of this Dark earth. Flora But when that moon goes down, The stars will shine again. Boisdale But give no light. They will Not light me through this wilderness of life. As travelers in this hour of thirst, pant for The cooling stream, so does my soul for thy Sweet healing love. Flora But there are other streams. Boisdale Ah, none shall slake my thirst! The more I drink The more I want. Thou art my mountain stream, The purest waters on the face of earth Are those which rise the highest from the sea. Look on me, Flora! let me not despair! Flora No danger. Grief has its own balm. There are In nature medicines for all our ills. Boisdale There is no medicine can cure this grief. Flora What is thy grief? Boisdale Are you so skilled in cures, And yet know not my grief? You should, to know The remedy, first know the ill; for there Are ills which have no cure. Flora But none time will Not heal. Boisdale But mine grows worse with age, Alas! The intenseness of our feelings measures life. And thus our years are measured by our pains. If we have many, we have fewer years. And thus, in one, we live through many lives, Making that life of many lives our age. Pain is the scythe which lays our harvest low, The reaper that mows down our better life. It is the unseen worm within the bud, Born in our heart's deep core! Flora You look upon The dark side of all things. Boisdale All things are dark! Flora They are but shadows of the light of life, Life's picture here unfinished else. Pain is A necessary thing, else life had been All joy. Boisdale Ah, Flora! did you know my heart! As autumn's damps make sere the fragile leaf, As sorrow chills the heart of man! One robs The leaf of all its springtime gaity; The other robs the heart of all its youth! Flora, did you know my heart, you would Be sorry from your soul. Flora I'm glad I do Not know it then. Boisdale But you should know my heart. Do you not recollect the hours we spent In youth? Flora I do, Boisdale Were they not joyful hours? Flora I think they were. Boisdale Do you not know then, ever? Flora Why ask me this? Boisdale Then we were friends. Flora Are now! Boisdale Then, on the whirlwinds of my passionate soul, Were all thy blessed words borne up to Heaven! The dew drop, trembling in the morning's ray, By Phoebus from the mountain flowret kist, Was not more vestal than thy virgin heart! Flora Not less so now. Boisdale Then let me kiss thy hand! Flora Nay, that is wrong. Boisdale You did not think so then. Once you were happy in my love. Flora You jest. Nay, Boisdale, you wish to anger me. Boisdale I would not harm you for the world. Flora Then hush Talk not of youth nor love. Boisdale Once you were glad To prattle of those innocent days. Flora Then we Were children, talked as such. Boisdale Ah, we have talked Like children since. Flora I think you talk so now. Boisdale Would you could feel as you did then, that we Could talk as we did then. Flora We have no need Of children's talk. Boisdale We have much need of it. Thy smiles were then to me as heaven to him, Who on the threshold of the skies, first gets A glimpse of immortality. Thenâthenâ I cut thy name upon a tree; mine was Above, thine all below; it stands there now, A living witness of our love. Thy tracks I used to follow in the sand, as if They were some book I loved to read. But now, Where is that childhood now? Flora 'Tis gone, and think No more of it. Boisdale Then I must cease to live. Ah, Flora! let me kiss thy hand. Flora Well then, You may. Boisdale Not that, the left one, next thy heart. Whose flowers are these? Flora Why ask me that? Boisdale The kings? Thus do I crush them to the earth! (Snatching them from her and trampling on them.) Flora Frail man! Think not to win me from the king this way! As you have bruised these flowers, so shall he bruise Thy heart. Boisdale Not all the powers on earth could add One atom to its grief. I am king-proof. I stand amid the saplings of the woods, A mighty oak! I lift my thousand arms To heaven, forgetful of the lightning's blast, Time-racking hail, or thunder! Why should I Then, fear thy king? The hour is nigh, at hand, The thunder-clap of his dark fall shall drown The breakage of a hundred wrecks at sea. Flora No, Boisdale, you shall not harm the king. He is above thy flight. Boisdale My soul soars high, Higher than Eagle ever flew! Flora Then Sir, Disdain the flight of meaner birds. Boisdale I do Therefore, I hate thy hawk. Flora My hawk? Boisdale Thy hawk, Or crow, or vulture, which you please. Flora The king Shall hear of this. Boisdale Would he were here to hear It now. Flora You would not dare to look at him. He is the sun! Boisdale Take care of thine eyes Flora They have been tempered to his heavenly beams. Boisdale (Aside) A Pythagoras Prometheus has inspired. Flora They have drunk glory from his heavenly smiles. Away! Boisdale You have grown sensitive of late, The fate of queens. Flora You are offensive, Sir! Boisdale Who saw thy bud of love unfold itself To heaven? This will be prison to the king. You loved me then. Flora I loved you not. Boisdale You said You did. Flora No, had I loved you then, this last Rash act had swept it all away, even as The ocean, in his angry mood, sweeps off The name once written on his shore! Farewell! (Exit.) Boisdale Oh, God! if ever there was Hell on earth, If ever there was Hell beyond the grave, No, all the Hells in Hell were heaven to this. A calculating coldness fills my heart. With awful coldness. Yes, the king shall die! And down descend plague-spotted into Hell, With everlasting curses on his soul. (Exit.) End of Act Third Act IV Scene I (A magnificent apartment in Holyrood House, Edinburgh, splendidly decorated for a fancy ball, in the center of which a throne of purple is raised, embroidered with gold against which leans the harp of the Minstrel of Mirandola. Enter Highland ladies and gentlemen, who dance to delightful music. Enter Charles Stuart as king, Flora Macdonald as Melpomene, Madalena, or the Page, as Apollo, and Sir Ronald as Mars.) Charles Stuart (Leading Apollo to the throne.) Swell high the joyful notes! swell high the joyful song! And let thy trembling fingers kiss the strings As softly as the zephyrs sigh amen. Thy raven locks, now flowing on thy neck Of alabaster purity. Break forth And let thy modulations be so soft As echoes from the sighs of those that love. Apollo's Song If you break the smallest link In the softest earthly chain, Save the one of which I think, You may mend it oft again; But the heart that ever is riven, Oh, it cannot mended be, For its links were made in Heaven, And the smiles that came from thee. If you rob the turtle's nest, If her little ones she tries, All the next day to find rest, With her pinions in the skies; And, alas! wherever driven, She is willing there to be Just because she has no Heaven, Like my soul, love, without thee! (The king and Mars retire among the crowd to the back of the stage, while Melpomene, who has been gazing on him intently, approaches him with the Golden Violet of Minstrelsy.) Melpomene If tales of other times be true, sweet Page, Thou art indeed the God of Minstrelsy.) Apollo And thou, sweet Melpomene, the Tragic Muse. Melpomene As thy acinthus was of yore to young Catona's child, so let me be to thee. And let the badge of Minstrelsy be placed, By Caledonia's mournful flower upon Thy youthful heart. (Placing it on his heart.) Apollo I thank thee, Queen of Love, For who would not be crowned by thy fair hand, When in thy sunny smiles the meanest flower Is made to blossom in eternal youth. Melpomene Relinquish not thy hold, fair gentle youth. And let the flower of Caledonia's isle Present thee, kneeling, with the richest gift That ever shone on earth, an honest heart. Apollo Thy heart, fair lady! No, the gift were far Too great for aught but Caledonia's son. Melpomene And may not Caledonia's Mournful Flower Be made the Crown of thy divinity? Apollo 'Tis prudence, not disdain, forbids it now. But were thy Minstrel aught but what he is, Thou shouldst behold thy more than beauteous smiles Reflected from the mirror of his soul, As clearly as Diana's face in Heaven Beholds her likeness in the lowly sea; For thy art now as far above thy Page, As was Diana when she left her Heaven To seek Endymion on the Carian Mount. Melpomene Nay, why the downcast sadness of thine eyes, In which there is so much of love divine, As if the schoolboy's genius had been just Rebuked in innocence? Nay, look not so. Apollo Were thy Fernando to receive thy gift He could not make thee suitable amends, And thou, his benefactor, wouldst have power To bind his soul in thraldom from this hour, Even to the sullying of his purity. When next we meet, fair lady mine, thou wilt Forgive me for declining thy fair hand, And save me from imploring pardon now. (Descending from the throne.) Melpomene Stay, gentle youth! Depart not from me yet! Apollo Nay, thou shalt lift thy drooping head ere long, And give thy odor to the godlike Charles, Thou hadst forgotten he was king? Farewell! (Exit Apollo.) Melpomene The king! (Charles Stuart comes forward.) My royal Charlesâthy Page is my king. A nobler being never lived on earth. Charles Stuart He is so hale, he seems not of this world, But of some glorious sphere where all is love. (They dance again to delightful musick when the king and Melpomene retire to the back of the stage. Reenter Apollo as Nymph of Dian.) Mars (Hastily approaching her.) Sweet Nymph of Dian! Oh, that beauteous face! Now to the snowy wings of hope lead me Again into the rosy bowers of peace, Where Beauty is made noble in love. Sweet Nymph, the God of War alone should lead Thee through the mazy dance. Nymph of Dian The God of War Should seek some hand more suited to his taste. The Nymph of Dian, drawn by four white stags In chariot of rich pearl, would ill befit The Thunder-Phaeton of the God of War. Mars There is but one immortal thing on earth, That is the soulâthat soul is loveâthat love Can bring the gods down from their lofty thrones, And bind them here on earth with rosy hands. Nymph of Dian Whose flowing festoons they must often break, And, bringing their most precious leaves to earth, Inhale the fragrance of the dying flower With more than wanton joy. Mars Such never loved. As divers value most the pearl that they Have fetched from stormy seas, so will my soul Value the jewel snatched from hours like these; For love is strongest in the boldest heart; The dulness of the quiet hour will make The lion feeble. Nymph of Dian Woman is not so. The strongest of her affections is the same In hours of greatest peril as in peace; She is the same unchanging thing you seeâ Full of undying love. But I have loved. 'Tis said the smiles of woman's love fall on Thy heart like moonlight on the crystal rill That winter has congealed. Mars It has been so; But now affection's day-god melts away The unsunned ice that froze my formal heart, And lets its crystal fountains loose for thee. Th' immortal beauty of thy face is now Buffeted from the mirror of that stream, Which thy sweet notes have thawed to flowing love. See how Diana climbs the Hills of Heaven, (Looking out.) As if she sought the chambers of the Sun, Meek as the soul that seeks thy love tonight, For as the night without the glorious Moon, So is my soul without thy richer smiles. Nymph of Dian How sad she seems. Mars What looks she like to thee? Nymph of Dian Priligion leaning on the breast of God. Mars See how she gazes on this world below As if she wondered how we love so much, Not knowing that my soul burns on for thee, In ceaseless splendor like her own sweet light. Nymph of Dian I would not be ungrateful for the world; The ungrateful soul is like the faithless dog, That snarls while eating from his master's hand; I, therefore, smile upon the noble Mars, And give him thanks. Mars Nay, do not leave me yet! The rose exhaling its sweets to heaven Invites the florist to its native bower. Nymph of Dian Yes, we must part. Mars Not yet. Nymph of Dian Indeed, we must Mars There is no glory in the warriour's strife, Wherein his soul is prompted to high deeds, So spirit-stirring as one hour with thee. The Moon, now holding of her silent course In Heaven, moves not along that blue serene With grace more pensive than thy gentle steps Sped like the antelopes in joy to me. Nymph of Dian But say, thou hast forgot the Minstrel Boy? Mars Ah, dost thou know that generous boy? Nymph of Dian I do; And see you have forgotten him that said, But now, you never could forget. Mars That boy; I never will forget him in the world. But have you seen the face of that fair youth? Nymph of Dian I have most noble Mars. I learn he is Thy chief companion. Mars Nearest to my heart Of all on earth, except the one who now Adores him more than she dare say. Nymph of Dian I do, Great Mars, adore that gentle youth. Mars Dost love That gentle boy? Nymph of Dian With all my heart. Why, is It strange the Nymph of Dian should so love? Mars It is not strange for no one ever saw His face, who did not love. Nymph of Dian I am in love. Wilt thou not recommend me to that Page? Come, thou shalt promise me when next we meet, That this same Page shall speak of me in terms Borrowed from thy most lofty praise. Mars All that The tongue of man can say shall then be said. (Aside.) That is the first time Ronald ever lied! (Exit Nymph of Dian.) I would not have her to behold that Page For Stuart's wealth in Caledonia's crown! What, gone! Then I must kneel here all alone. (Ee kneels, his bowed head on his hand. They dance off again to delightful music, then exeunt omnes. Reenter Nymph of Dian as Fernando the Page. Page What, Mars upon his knees? The God of War Should not permit his knees to kiss the earth. To what idolatry is valour bowed? Perhaps at this propitious hour thy heart Is playing truant with thy country's cause; Is worship of some great divinity More sacred than Charles Stuart's crown? Mars Thy words are truth, fair Page. Page Where are thine eyes That, in the burnished glare of solid steel, Can pierce the vistas of the warriour's helms, And court the bannered host afar; but still Are blind to Flora's heavenly charms. Mars (Aside) Thank God! The generous boy has coupled his desires With all my hopes. The nymph of Dian's name Shall not be mentioned lest it free new hopes. Flora Macdonaldâshe is neither thine But not the love of Marsâthine is the heartâ Genius like thine is Flora's soul's delight. But look, thou art the same angelic-limbed, Sweet creature like the frightened antelope. As much as is the Moon upon the sea The likeness of the same sweet Moon in Heaven! And now thy sighs responsive to thy smiles Are all like hersâthey are the same to me, And yet thou art Fernando. Speak again! Page Methinks, great Mars, the God of Wine Has brought thee to thy knees. In love, my lord? (Fondingly.) Did not the downward flowing of her locks Grow ashen in the fires of thy breath, Like the sad droopings of the willow bough, Swayed by the kisses of the odorous breeze? (Teasingly.) For like the cedar evergreen, she stood, Courting my whispers with her amorous looks And, grasping held my hand, prest it so soft, A thrill of tenderness ran through my heart, And told me what her own then feltâ(Enough)â(Aside.) (Flora Macdonald is not loved by Mars)â(Aloud.) Until my raptured soul drank in her words, Which made my heart intoxicate with sweets, And sounds of harmony. Ay, lived upon Her sighs, as on an atmosphere of song, Which seemed to feed me with immortal youth! Mars By Heavens, thy words are echoes of her own! Thy smilesâthy very eyes like hersâallâallâ Hast thou no sister? Page None in all this world. Mars Ah, thou incarnate spirit! thou art so Engrafted in my soul that all the world Seems hallowed by thy beams. Come we must go. (Exeunt.) Scene II (A private apartment in Holyrood House. Enter Charles Stuart to Fernando.) Page Oh, good my lord, have you not seen The lovely Flora yet. Charles Stuart Why ask me that Which you already know? She kist thy hand, Beguiled the time most ardently with you. Page Indeed, she did not, though she prest it oft, And trembled while she did so; hers was moist And softer than the down upon the swan. Charles Stuart And did she sigh to thee? Page She did, my lord, Presenting me a jeweled ring, which shone Like Hesperus. Her words dropt from her lips Like honey from the parted comb. Charles Stuart (Aside) Fine wordsâ The very ring I gave to herâfine words; And you accepted it, of course? Page Not so, I bade her earnestly take back the gift, And in refusing whispered in her ear, Those soothing words which were more grateful than Apologies. Charles Stuart In love! Page Is that a crime? Charles Stuart It is. What would the Caledonian Flower Do with DiOssima, my youthful Page? Page I thought as much, therefore, refused the gifts. Charles Stuart But know you not that Ronald is in love? Page With whom, my lord? Charles Stuart With Flora, to be sure. Page It isâit is not so. Charles Stuart Art sure of that? Page I spoke to him in Madalena's praise, At which his bosom panted as for war. He loves thy daughter as he does his life. Charles Stuart Nay, you shall have my Madalena, boy. Page Indeed, Sir Ronald would be jealous then. He has best right to Madalena's love. Charles Stuart But mind! You sing for Flora no more songs. Page What, think you that Fernando would unsurp The right of royal Charles? Was it for this He left his native landâbecame thy Page? Charles Stuart Most noble boy, thou art thyself again! Come to my arms! Page (Embracing him.) Then promise me one thing, Shall not Sir Ronald be thy son? Charles Stuart He shall, For he is noble, worthy of my child. Page Then, let me go, for he must know of this. Charles Stuart But mind! I will be jealous if he grasp Thy hand too often; it must all be mine. (Exit Page.) (Enter Lochiel) What news, my noble friend? Lochiel No news, my lord, But from that Boisdale. Charles Stuart The Highland Chief? Lochiel The very same. Charles Stuart He was the first who chanced To meet me on the shore. Lochiel The first, my lord? Charles Stuart The very first. Lochiel Well, that is strange. Charles Stuart Why so? Lochiel Did he receive you with much joy? Charles Stuart Not heâ It was no greeting such as thine. Lochiel Most true. But did no angry words between you pass? Charles Stuart Not one. When he refused to bring us troops, My Page accosted him with his drawn sword, At which his bosom panted like the sea, As if it bore an agony within, Too mighty for his heart. Lochiel Would he had burst. Charles Stuart Why so? Lochiel Because he is thy deadliest foe. Charles Stuart I care not for his rage. There never was A storm without a calm. Lochiel There is no calm To his eternal storm. Charles Stuart I heed him not. Man's passion is the suicidal act That kills itself. Why should I care for him? Lochiel He will destroy thy life. Charles Stuart How heard you this? Lochiel From his own lips. Charles Stuart From his own lips? The fool Has impudence enough to drown his rage. Lochiel It is amphibiousâcannot drown. Charles Stuart What is The cause of this? Lochiel Thy Flora, so he says. Charles Stuart The fool is mad. Tell Ronald of this thing, He must be watched. Lochiel He has an evil heart. The lion, raged, will show his teethâhe will Uncase his fangsâthey are the shafts of death. He seemed to gather all his soul in one. Great effort to disgorge his wrath, his lungs Still heaving like the sea, his nostrils wide, His visage all inflated, dark as Hell, His eyeballs glaring, forehead pursed to frowns, His lips still pregnant with intent to speak, His arm highlifted, clenched his fists, As if to clutch his victim by the throat, His teeth still grinding all distinct to view, As when the wild boar whets his tusks for war; And thus while laboring to repress his wrath, Which like the swollen torrent would come forth, He vomited his black bile on thy name. Charles Stuart Look out for him! Set every blood hound on His track; pursue him to the Gates of Death; When found precipitate him down to Hell! (Exeunt) Scene III (Culloden, the battlefield. Enter Sir Ronald and Fernando to Charles Stuart. Alarums.) Charles Stuart What news from Falkirk? Sir Ronald Glorious news, But sadder far than glorious is the news That comes from old Drumossie Muir! Charles Stuart What news? Sir Ronald The Chiefs are routed from the field; one half Are slain. We must not tarry here, come fly! Charles Stuart No, let me rally our brave men again, And cheer their drooping spirits for the fight. What, would you have us run like frightened lambs, From the obstreperous howlings of such wolves? No, let my cousin of Cumberland come on! Sir Ronald (Alarums.) My lord, thy valor should be curbed awhile! Let prudence by thy shield to save thy life! It is too noble to be lost in such Inglorious strife. If we are beaten, we Must fly. Away, the foe is near us now. Charles Stuart Adversity may chill the heart of Charles, But no despair shall ever quench its fire. (Alarums.) Page Come, we must fly! Away to Boradale. Charles Stuart What, fly to Boradale where first my Page, In Scotland's holy name took up his lyre, And like the river to the parching vales, Poured on my thirsting soul the tide of song, Which made the flowers of love immortal grow? No, let them come; my soul is mighty yet. Sir Ronald I heard the clangor of the eagle's wings Hurtling amid the bustling clouds of Heaven, While clambering up their perilous cliffs To fan the sun to glory. On he flew! My sight grew tired to follow him so far, When suddenly as if by lightnings struck, He curveted once more the bounds of Heaven. Charles Stuart Stay the bold eagle in his flight to Heaven, Or pierce the bosom of the milky swan Soaring aloft above the reed isles green. As well may ye attempt to curb me now. I tell you that my soul is mighty yet. Sir Ronald Fair as the Moon that came to watch her there, Feeding an eagle from an ivory cup, That Genius sculptured for the Feast of Fame. And while he stood there pouring out his song Drinking the fire of glory from her hand, A voice from out the angry cloud was heard Muttering dolorous vengeance in her soul. I saw him fix his keen eye on the throne, And ere the thunderbolt could lay her low, Anchored his talons on the perilous shaft, And saved his holy Minister from death! Charles Stuart A dream more beauteous never has been told. Before me in the visions of the night, Went the tall warhouse through the Highland camp, Lifting his trumpet nostrils in the air, With feet dabling in blood. Heard ye no sound? The fiery depths of the infernal world Seemed to disgorge the entrails of her wrath. Sir Ronald My lord, it was an omen of thy fall! Charles Stuart But on that steed a rider rode, who said, âRemember Stuart, to avenge my death!â It was my father. He is mighty yet. (Alarums.) (Enter Lochiel in haste.) Lochiel My lord, we are in danger here. Come, fly! The living are now treading on the slain, Like sleepless ghosts that come to stalk the world, Vomiting the fire of desolation forth! Charles Stuart Who leads them on? Lochiel That traitor Boisdale. Charles Stuart Oh, for a hundred thousand years to kill Him in! Had he as many lives as there Are sands upon the sea, I'd kill them all. Sir Ronald They come my lord, they come upon us now! Charles Stuart Come forth my sword! Draw, every one of you, And let us stand for Liberty or Death. (Enter Boisdale with English soldiers.) Boisdale Behold the power of Boisdale's revenge. He comes to set thee on thy throne in Hell! Charles Stuart This sword shall be thy passport to that place. Come on, ye paleface, chicken-hearted rats! And let me teach you Stuart's skill. No, stand, And let your hearts grow stronger by delay. Boisdale Give back the jewel which you stole from me! You cannot wear it on your crownâ'tis lost. Charles Stuart I wear your jewel, as you call her, in My heart. Boisdale Give back that jewel or thy life! Soldier Was it for public or for private good, You brought us here? Boisdale For public good Charles Stuart Thou fiend! I will not suffer thee to live an hour! (They fight. Sir Ronald, Lochiel, and Fernando, back out the Soldiers, while Stuart forces Boisdale off the stage. Alarums. Reenter Charles Stuart and Fernando.) Page Where is that villian Boisdale? Charles Stuart He fled. Page Where is Sir Ronald? Charles Stuart Fighting still. Page Where? now, My lord, he may be slain! Charles Stuart No, he shall live, He is too brave to die. Page See, Lochiel comes; But not Sir Ronald, he is slain! (Reenter Lochiel.) Charles Stuart How now? Page Where is Sir Ronald? Speak! Lochiel My lord, he lives. Thy cousin of Cumberland is on the field; Ten thousand pounds are offered for thy head. Charles Stuart A thousand pounds I would not give that price For all the heads in Christendom, were they Not such as thine. What think you of that dog's? Lochiel What, Boisdale? I would not have his heart. He comes replenished with new troops. Charles Stuart Again? Lochiel Again, my lord. Charles Stuart I thought he had enough. Lochiel The bloodhound is upon thy trackâhe thirsts Not only for the prize, but for thy blood! Charles Stuart Then he shall die for want of both. Lochiel Then, fly To Boradale! While my words hang on His lips, the fires of Hell burn in his heart! The foe is near us now. Thy flight is safe To Boradale! Charles Stuart Come hither, Page. Page (Approaching him.) My, lord! Charles Stuart (Giving him a letter.) Be thou unto me as the faithful Dove That goest in quest of some immortal leaf, Then comes back laden to an Ark divine. Page The Eagle may outsoar the Doveâbut yet The Dove flies swifter to her native nest. The bee that gathers honey from the flower, Knows where to find that tender flower again; And as it hungers for the same sweet flower, So will Fernando for his master's love. Charles Stuart Then we shall wrestle with the storms of fate, Like Jacob with his angel in the night, And rise up from the labour with the strength Of an immortal. Fare thee well! Page Farewell! Charles Stuart I send thee from the Ark to my fond love, A cross the deluge of deep grief to fly, And bring me back the olive leaf of Peace. Page I will if there is dry land to be found. (Exit.) Lochiel My lord, the foe is near us now! Charles Stuart They are, Let us evade them; lie in ambush here. They will not harm Fernando? Lochiel No, they ask Thy life, not his. Charles Stuart Meanwhile, you seek Sir Ronaldâbring him safe to Boradale. Lochiel I will, my lord. Farewell, till we shall meet Again. Charles Stuart Farewell, may Heaven defend thy steps. (Exeunt.) Scene IV (Another part of the field. Enter Sir Joshua Macdonald wounded, leaning on Fernando 's arm.) Page (Dropping the letter) Macdonald wounded? Dying? Speak, my friend! Macdonald Ay, wounded but not dead. Page Then rise again And let us seek our Prince. Macdonald No, let me die. I would not live to see my country's fall! Page Ay, rise; the enemy is near us now. Macdonald Had I an eagle's wings I would not fly. Page Then lean upon Fernando's arm; though weak Yet will it help to bear you from the field. (As he attempts to rise, he falls again.) Oh, noble chieftain, thou art gone, too late! Macdonald Take back my dying wordsâgo to my Prince, Tell him that my daughter is his wife. Page As thy last dying wish, it shall be done. How art thou now, brave friend? Macdonald I am no more. (Dies.) Page Oh God, my noble friend is dead. Farewell! (Enter Boisdale picking up the letter.) Boisdale What have we here? A letter! Yes, a dead Man and a Page. This comes of thy great lord. Page (Approaching him) Give me that letterâit is mine! Boisdale 'Tis thine? How came it on the ground? Page I dropt it there. Do give it to me! Boisdale Who gave it to you? The king? It goes to Ormaclade. I see it does. It is directed to his amorous queen. Then as the amorous Wind deflowers the Rose, So will I rifle it of all its sweets. Page Oh, do not break the sealâI beg you not! Boisdale What was his charge concerning it? Speak quick! Page Oh, do not break the seal! Boisdale Was that his charge? Then will I break it, as I will his heart. Page Oh, do not! for a thousand worlds I would Not have you break that seal! Boisdale Then tell me all. Where is thy king? Speak, or the letter flies. Page Nay, give it me. Boisdale Will not the contents tell? Speak, or it flies! (He breaks open the letter and reads.) The sealing of thy lips And not my hands, did break the seal. Away! Go, bear it to thy mistressâall is right. (Returns the letter.) Page For this rash act thy blood shall drench the earth! Boisdale Be not too rash or thine shall flow. You know You called me traitor once. Page Ay, traitor thrice! A double villian! earth has not thy match, No, nor the depths of Hell. All honest men Shall hate the name of one named after thee, And evil men grow jealous of thy name, Because thou art above all emulation! Boisdale Peace, peace, young boy! Page As you have broken thisâ So is the seal upon my lips; now read The contents of my soul! Boisdale Show not thy pearls, Or if you will, but do it with a smile. Page Within the casket of my heart there lies A truth, which couldst thou see, would strike thee blind! Boisdale It is so rare I only hear it when It thunders; then I know 'twill rain. Page You are No wit. Boisdale I do not pass for one. Page You are A base, abandoned wretch! You are no man! A serpent who has fangs, but fears to bite! Boisdale My poison then will do no harm. Page That is No virtue. Good is negatived in you By fear of doing evil. Good, without Volition, is no good at all. An act, To be a good one, must be done by one Who does it for the sake of good. When did You this? Boisdale Look there upon the ground. See what Your king has done. Talk not of goodness now! Page What has he done? Boisdale Destroyed that good old man. Page Would he were here to hear that lie! Base fiend! The last word that he spoke was of the king. Nay, ask thy wretched soulâlet conscience tell Who is the murderer! Thy cheeks are pale! It was thy very hand that took his life! Boisdale That letter is an antidote for thine. Page You dare not look me in the face. Boisdale Away! And when thy heraldry is over, we Shall meet again! Page No, never let me See thy face again! Boisdale At Boradale we all Shall meet again, where each shall know his doom. (Exeunt severally. Enter Lochiel and Sir Ronald in haste.) Sir Ronald Where is my lord? Lochiel Fledâgone to Boradale. Sir Ronald Then let us hence. What have we here? Ye gods! It is the temple of the mightiest soul That ever lived in man. Lochiel Alas, what is This world, if sacriligious hands shall rob A temple of such heavenly workmanship, Of such a soul? Sir Ronald It is an object world! His thoughts were so sublime they were like stars Above the midnight of men's minds, on which They gazed with emulation, as of old, The Chaldean Shepherds watched the stars with joy And admiration. Look how low he lies! See where the golden bowl was broken, how The wine of life wastes on the abject earth. It looks up in the peaceful face of Heaven, Imploring vengeance on the foe! Lochiel Come, let Us lay him in the dark coldâhe rests. Sir Ronald And as the face of the embowered lake Reflects the foliage on its verdant banks, So shall the mirror of our deeds today, Shew forth our actions to the latest time. (Exeunt, bearing the body out.) Scene V (Ormaclade. A magnificent apartment in Macdonald's palace. Flora is seated on a sofa binding a bouquet of flowers. Enter Boisdale seizing her by the arm.) Boisdale Now Princess, thou art mine! Flora (Rising indignantly.) What do you mean? Let go my arm? Boisdale Where is thy Page? Flora I know Not where he is. Why ask me that? Boisdale You have Not heard the news? Flora What news? Boisdale Most direful news. The king has fled! Flora Fled where? Boisdale To Boradale. He was obliged to flyâhis troops are slain. Flora Oh, joyless fate! Where is my father? Boisdale Dead! Flora My father dead! my father slain! Oh, God! Then let me die! Who slew my father? You? Boisdale It is not known. You cannot now be queen. His cousin of Cumberland will wear the crown. Flora Oh, joyless fate! There is no comfort now. Boisdale Look on the face of him who loves you still. Oh, beauteous island in the Sea of Life! Though darker be the waves around thee cast, Yet will the sunshine of my former love, Mantle thy bosom with the spring of joy! There on thy beauteous bosom girt by waves Of sorrowâlet me lean my pensive head. Flora What would you have me do? Boisdale Be mineâforget The pastâlook on me as thy lordâthy kingâ Ay, wed thine equalâwed with him whom Heaven Designed for thee. Flora Then show me to the king. Boisdale No, he is gone. Come, fly with me to some Sweet island where we will be king and queen. Where we will reign, the king and queen! With you it would be peopled with the world. Flora Ah, Boisdale, have you not spoken false? Boisdale In what, my love? Flora Where is my father? Boisdale Dead! Flora The king? Boisdale In Hell, I hope. Flora Then, fly from me. Boisdale Be calm, my love. Flora My sorrows make me calm. Boisdale Then, will you not be mine? Flora No, Boisdale, I tell thee, never! Boisdale Nay, relent! You know I love youâlove you as my life. Flora Away! Boisdale Will you live single? Flora Die the maid I am, Or Stuart's wife. Boisdale But he is gone. Flora Then I Will wed his memory. Boisdale Look down, ye gods! And tell me from your starry thrones, what doom Is hanging on me now? Flora The doom of death! Boisdale You echo but the voice of mine own soul. For, rather now than live this living death, I will put poison in the Cup of Fate, And, drinking with the king thy health, go down With him the bloody path to Hell! Farewell! Flora Death spurs the bloodless sides of his pale horse, Impatient for thy life. Boisdale The king! the king! (Exeunt severally.) Scene V (Boradale. The sea shore. A ship at anchor, lying in the distance. A storm. Thunder and lightning. Enter Charles Stuart disguised.) Charles Stuart The splintery lightnings scourge the angry clouds, Until they weep themselves to death in rain; While yonder sea lies hovering as with fear. The mighty thunder rolls from cloud to cloud. Shaking the ponderous earth with tremendous fear, As if Heaven's battlements were tumbling down. It is the footsteps of the mighty God Walking in storms. Boisdale (without) Howl on! Charles Stuart He comes. (Enter Boisdale not observing Charles Stuart.) Boisdale Howl on, Ye mighty Thunders, howl! the voice of Fiends Were silence to the thunders of my thoughts. Come down, ye massy clouds! Come down in floods, And drown me like the sea. Tear up the pines And pile them on my head as high as heaven. Lead me to some impending cliffs, where rolls The noiseless river of the deadâthen pitch Me down to Hell! Charles Stuart You stand upon that cliff. Below is Hades! there, the inky stream Which rolls in sullen lethargy along The Vale of Death! Boisdale Is there oblivion in That wave? Charles Stuart Eternal death! Oblivion stands, With open arms to hide thee from the Past. Boisdale Put memory in the grave and all is well. Charles Stuart Thy life is forfeited! Boisdale Whose voice is that? I know that voiceâit echoes through my soul. The dead sea of my heart is turned to fire, And every hope lies drowned beneath the wave! Charles Stuart This sword shall be thy passport to that place! Boisdale Who wields that sword? Charles Stuart An enemy to thee! Behold! (Throwing off his disguise.) Boisdale (Drawing) Usurper! villian that thou art! I am destructionâproof! You cannot hurt Me now! Come on! Charles Stuart Strike, traitor, for thy last! (they fight. Boisdale falls.) Charles Stuart Downâdown among the Fiends! Boisdale The Fiends are here. (Dies.) (Enter Flora Macdonald attended by Francisco, the Monk, and the Page.) Charles Stuart Oh, Flora, you have come in blessed time! (Embracing her.) Flora My lord, that traitor said that you were gone. Charles Stuart What traitor? Flora Boisdale. Charles Stuart Ah, name him not. See where he liesâbeneath the reach of hate. The earth that gave him life now drinks his blood. Where is Sir Ronald? Page Ah, he may be slain! Charles Stuart Macdonald? Page He is dead. I saw him die. Charles Stuart Ah, Flora, noble Flora, is he dead? Flora He is, my lord. Fernando says he is. Charles Stuart Then let me help you weep, for he was great. Page He bade me tell you, ere he died, he could Not live to see his country's fall. Charles Stuart Alas, All that could dignify the valorous heart, And make him nobler than the rest of men, Impelled him onward in his country's cause. Page He bade me say that Flora was your wife. Charles Stuart She is my wifeâmy noble wife! (Embracing her.) (Enter Sir Ronald and Lochiel.) Sir Ronald My lord! Charles Stuart My noble friends, you are most welcome here! My gratitude is all that I can give. Sir Ronald 'Tis all we wish. We are most glad you live. Charles Stuart (Pointing to Boisdale.) Look on the opprobrious earth! There lies A traitor slainârotting upon the earth That valor has denied to him. Sir Ronald Poor fool! If he had lived a thousand years, he could Not have been better slain! Lochiel His life was one Continual strife for that which Nature had Denied to him! Page (To Sir Ronald) Have you no word for me? Sir Ronald My heart is bankrupt for sufficient words To give thee praise. Charles Stuart In all my sorrow there Is joy. Page For sorrow is life's shadeâthe moon Shines brightest in the darkest nightâso does The light of joy upon the greatest grief. Charles Stuart Thou art the Ministering Angel of my life, And could I now behold my childâmy own Dear MadalenaâI would die in peace. Page Then you shall die in peaceâfor here she isâ Behold thy child! (Throwing off his disguise.) Charles Stuart (Amazed) What do I see? my child? A spirit or my child? Madalena Thy child, thy child! Charles Stuart Come to my arms, my child! it is my child! (Clasping her in his arms.) Sir Ronald Great God, my heart is in my throat! Charles Stuart Look down Ye angels, on this blessed sight! look down Upon a father's love, who would not give His child for all the thrones on earth. Sir Ronald Look down, Ye Angels, who have watched above our souls! She is the âNymph of Dian!â (Embracing her.) Madalena God of War! Flora âApolloâ of the masquerade? Madalena The same And thou sweet Melpomene the Tragic Muse! Sir Ronald As Stuart's âPageâ I loved thee from my heart; As âNymph of Dianâ better than his Page; As Madalena better far than all! Madalena As Ronald's self alone, I loved you first; âGod of Warâ, I loved you none the less; And now, as Ronald, first and last, I love You still! Sir Ronald Then I am happyâhappier far Than if a king! Charles Stuart And I am king indeed! Before high heaven, I join your hearts and hands. Sir Ronald I wish I had a thousand hearts; I'd give Them with a thousand hands. Charles Stuart She is thy wife. And now, sweet Flora, let me take thy hand, And in the face of heaven pronounce thee mine. Francisco (Joining their hands) I do present thee to thy lord, while with The present, I bestow thy lord on thee. (Alarums.) Sir Ronald Friends of my soul, we are in danger yet! Charles Stuart Come to my arms, my wife, my child! (Alarums.) Sir Ronald They come! Come, Lochiel, we must meet them front to front; And save our friends! (Exeunt Lochiel and Ronald. Alarums.) Charles Stuart We must not tarry here. Come to the ship, the ship! Madalena Nay, father, stay! I see Sir Ronald's plume! it waves! he reels! He totters! sinks to the earth! he's slain! (She faints.) Charles Stuart She falls! Sir Ronald's slain! Now, we must fly! (He bears his daughter in his arms, and they enter the ship as the curtain falls.) End of Act Fourth Act V Scene 1 (Mirandola. A magnificent apartment in Charles Stuart's palace, as in Act First, Scene the First. Enter Charles Stuart and Flora.) Charles Stuart Now do mine eyes behold all that my soul Hath pictured to me in my dreamsâinfinite perfection in thy form, Of angel beauty, whom my dying friend, In the last moments of his parting soul, Bade me remember. Flora Ah, you were his friend. Charles Stuart And now thy beauty steals upon me in The likeness of that being gone. Thou artâ If ever beauty mirrored back in truth, The likeness of her parentageâthou art Indeed Macdonald's child. Why do you weep? Flora Oh, how my soul could love him, did he live, Seeing it loves him so now he is dead. Charles Stuart I recollect the hour when first my heart Was stirred to passion by the birth of love; For when my heart first mixed itself with thine, And each beat bounding unto each, thy voice Stole on my raptured soul as soft as if The spirit of the solitude had sighed. Man is deluded when he hopes to build Ambitious temple on unhallowed ground. He lays his corner stone upon the bones Of man-made cement by their own dear blood. The more I see of thee, the more I hate The vanities of kings. Flora How much great good Could you bestow on man, were you to teach Them what you know. Charles Stuart Had I the power to make My voice a trumpet for mankind, I would Arouse the Present to a dignity Of Self, and make it live in centuries Of years to come. I would send forth my thoughts As on eagle wings, through all the dark Abysmal future where sits raven Time In silence, on her peaceful years unfledged, And scatter them to all mankindâwhere each Should grow to Liberty's triumphant tree, And fill the earth with one continuous shadeâ Beneath whose oaky boughs forever green, The generations yet unborn should sit, And see their present joys in other years, Fulfilled with prophet's eyes as mine to me. Flora What is it makes the vain, ambitious man, Unsurp the rights of other men? Charles Stuart The love Of powerâthat bastard offspring of a want Of something good to do. Flora If all men have Their natural giftsâthose gifts which make them men, They all have natural rights which they should use Proportioned to those gifts. If they are not All equal in those several gifts, they have Enough to make them men, therefore, they all Profess an equal rightâshould use that right. Charles Stuart One subject of our realm we have to lose. Poor Madalena, she is sad indeed; And I am sad to think of her. Flora She is; And takes Sir Ronald's death but ill at heart. Charles Stuart I thought if I could only see her wed, I would be happy for the rest of life. Flora You might have known such interest for your sake, Betrayed ambition to that sake. Charles Stuart I did not think Her aught but what she seemed. Flora She acted well For she deceived Sir Ronald all the while. Charles Stuart She lay upon his bosom like the swan Upon clear waters, while his soul grew white To image back her form. She was his joy; And now she dies for Ronald's sake. Flora She does, Singing her own death song, like that same Swan, Which, matchless, will not seek another love. Charles Stuart But she has found her mateâshe takes the veilâ And what she could not find on earth, she hopes To find in Heaven. Flora It is most strange, that what We most desire on earth, to lose it here, We seek in Heaven. Charles Stuart It gives no joy to think That what we valued here, shall meet us there; For what is most like Heaven on earth, we hope To find in Heaven. Flora If we profess on earth That which is most like Heaven, we shall be most Like Heaven possessing it. If we seek Heaven, We shall profess the joy of that we seek. Charles Stuart In some degree we shall. She goes tonight. Then will she look her last upon the earth. The wavy grandeur of the sloping hills, Which look so beautiful in morning's light, As if they were the mighty graves of godsâ The rising stepstones to the Deity; The honest oneness of the verdant fields; The soft retiring mystery of the vales; And all the sweet variety of view, Which once was pleasing to her soul. Flora Alas, How different from her aspect while your Page! Charles Stuart Ah, sorrow works sad havoc with the heart! Flora But, what if he should comeâwould she have power To wed him then? Charles Stuart If she should wed High Heaven, And, after, break that vow for aught on earth, She would be forfeiting that Heaven. Flora Alas! Is he not all the Heaven she ever sought? The very Heaven for which she makes the vow? Then, if she take the veil to seek that Heaven, To find that Heaven is not to break that vow. Charles Stuart By all the ties of contract it is so. Flora Ah, that is what the priest would say. As for Myself, I do not think that aught on earth Could make me break the vow I made to you. Charles Stuart Then why her vow to Heaven? Flora Because the vow She made to Ronald was before the one She makes to Heavenâthe cause of that to Heaven. Charles Stuart It is no less a heavenly vow. Flora Then she Can wed him if he come. Charles Stuart How is she now? Flora No more the Minstrel Boy. Charles Stuart Her fate is sad. Does she not sing? Flora Ah, like the dying Swan! The saddest songs you ever heard. He yet may live And Hope is better than Despair, if he Should never come. Charles Stuart That is an Angel's truth And spoken by an Angel. Come, my love, For as before the rising of the sun, The mountain's tops are gilded by his beams, Gladdening the verdant prospect all around, So does thy soul betoken on thy face The pleasing sigh of coming good. Come on. Scene II A parlour in the convent of Santa Maria della Pieta, as in Act First, Scene Second. Enter Angela and the Madre to Francisco the Monk.) Angela Francisco, you are welcome home again. Where is my son? Monk Why did you bar the gates? Had you not done so, you had seen him long Ago. Angela How is Fernando? Is he well? Monk The great enigma must be solved. Angela What great Enigma? Speak! Fernando is not dead? Monk That will be known when you have solved this great Enigma. Angela Strange how he can sport with us, As if Fernando's death were naught to me; Oh, speak! if he is dead why, tell me so! Monk You have the name of that which you have not. Now, if you solve it, you shall hear if your Fernando live or not. Angela But if not solvedâ Monk You cannot hear. Angela Then I can never hear, For I can solve no riddle like to that; And, not to know, is but to feel his death. Madre You have learned much since you first went away. Monk I have learned much, but chief of all that I Have learned is to believe not what I see, Nor what I hear. Angela Why so? Monk Because we see, And do not see, and hear, and do not hear. Angela He speaks in parables. Monk I speak in truth. Madre What good is truth in such disguise? Monk 'Tis truth. Angela (To Madre) What can he mean? Madre I think he is deranged. Monk Had you but seen what I have seen, you had Been wise. Angela What have you seen? Come, tell us that. Monk Where is the Prince's daughter? Tell me that. Angela She is within. Monk Then bring her forth. Madre I will. (Exit.) Angela What do you mean by this strange talk? I pray You pardon meâI do not mean to tell. Angela Why not? Have you not been to Scotland yet? Monk I have. Angela And seen Fernando? Monk Ay, I haveâhave not. Angela Alas, I know he's dead. Monk How know you that? Angela You seem to say he is. But here she comes. (Reenter Madre leading in Madalena.) Madalena (Grasping his hand) Oh, holy father, you have come again! Speak, where is Fernando? Where is my lord? Monk What is thy name? Madalena My name? Why ask me that? Monk I wish to know. Madalena You frighten me. Monk You will Be more frightened than that before you die. Your name? Madalena My name is Madalena? Why? Monk You areâyet you are not. Madalena He is not dead? Has he returned? Monk He hasâyet he has not. Madalena Oh, do not grieve me thus! Has he returned? Where is your father? Madalena Dead. Monk Your mother? Madalena Dead! Monk (To Angela) What think you of this talk? Angela It is most strange. We are mislead; but who shall set us right? Monk You heard her say her sire was dead. Angela We did. Monk That Madalena was her name? Angela We did. We heard all that. Monk She isâyet she is not. She is the Madalena that you have, But not the Madalena that you seek, If Stuart's daughter is the one you wish. She bears the name of her, but that is all. Angela It is most strange! The more we see of her, The more we wish to see, which, seeing, makes Us only see the less. Nayâspeak to me! Are you not Stuart's daughter? Madalena No, he is No sire of mine. Angela But you are like to her, As if you were the same. Now we can see Wherein you spoke the truth. Monk There are more ways To speak the truth than one. Angela You are most learned. Monk This proves that every like is not the same. Fernando did not go. I was deceived. 'Twas Stuart's daughter went as Page. Angela As Page? What mysteries on mysteries? Then, you have been To Scotland, all for naught? Monk And learned by it, More than thy son will ever know. Madalena Could you Not tell a woman from a man? Monk I have Seen people worse deceived than that. She drest Her as a Page and called herself thy son. Angela And was her father, too, deceived? Monk He was, Until he came to Boradale, where she Unsexed herself. Madalena Then let me go. Angela Nay, stay, I must inquire about this marriage with My son. Monk And I will seek him in her stead. Angela Yes, go (Exit Francisco.) Was ever mystery like to this? (Exeunt omnes.) SCENE III (Street in Mirandola. Enter Sir Ronald. He perceives a wild swan soaring through the heavens.) Sir Ronald Thou art soaring away, beautiful bird, Upon thy pinions into distant land, Bathing thy downy bosom's loftiest flight In welkin zephyrs. Whither art thou borne From snowy home through heaven's unclouded depths, As now thy pillowed wings are cleaving heaven? (Enter Fernando.) Most noble youth, You live in Mirandola, do you not? Fernando I do. Are you a stranger in this place? Sir Ronald I am. You see it by this Highland dress. Fernando A Scottish garb? What news from Scotland now? Sir Ronald Ah, sad indeed. Fernando You tell me that by your looks The noble Stuart has been beat, they say? Sir Ronald Charles Stuart? Do you know that man? Fernando I do. Know you the Prince? Sir Ronald I know him well. Fernando Were you A soldier in the war? Sir Ronald I was. But know You not his daughter Madalena? Fernando Ah, That precious name! Call that sweet name again! It gives me more than joy? Sir Ronald (Aside) What can he mean? It cannot be that she is false? Ah, no, She is too pureâtoo good for that. Are you Acquainted with that name? Fernando The name most dear To me of all on earthâlinked with my joy In lifeâmy hopes in Heaven. Sir Ronald (Aside) If she is false, May all the thunderbolts of Heaven descend Upon me now! Tread mountains into vales, And overwhelm the sea, ye mighty gods, If she be false! Fernando What is the matter now? Are you in grief? Sir Ronald In grief? What is thy name? Fernando Fernando. Sir Ronald (Aside) Gods! the very name she chose To shrine her from the world! She loved the man, Or she had chosen not his name! The name By which I knew her first. I love that name. He must be noble. Else she had not chosen His name. It cannot be that she is false! No, no, it cannot be!âThy mother's name? Fernando Is Angela. Sir Ronald The tutoress of her youth. The one she called her mother, oh, ye Heavens! Fernando Why is this changeful mood? Are you in love? Sir Ronald (Aside) He taunts me, conscious of his triumph.âNo! The green oasis of my life is one Eternal wilderness of wo! Fernando The same as mine! A few short months ago, my hopes were bright; They led me to the gates of joy where Love Stood smiling, beckoning me to bliss, when, all At once, their snowy wings grew dark as night, And Grief now stands my only comfortor. Sir Ronald Has she rejected him? It must be so. My Madalena is not false. No, no, I fear we are twin-mated in our grief. Fernando Then we can feel each other's loss the more. The world cannot repay. I was betrothed. Sir Ronald But not to Stuart's daughter? Fernando No, to one Most beautiful, as much like her as if They had been twins. Sir Ronald You keep me on the rackâ She is the same! Fernando Not so, it is not so. Sir Ronald Her nameâ Fernando Is Madalena Sir Ronald 'Tis the same! Fernando It is not so. Sir Ronald Where is she now? Fernando Ah, lost, Forever lost! Our wedding day was set; And on that day, attired, she disappeared, And no one's eyes have ever seen her since. Sir Ronald The embers of aspiring joy begin To glimmer in my heart again. One ray Of hope falls on my soul, like that first star Which gems the pensive brow of even. She is Not falseâno, noâI shall be happy yet. Fernando What is thy grief? Sir Ronald Is Madalena well? On this hangs all my joy. Fernando I understand She takes the veil tonight. Sir Ronald Tonight, the veil! Why so? Fernando I do not knowâsome private grief. Sir Ronald Now then the withering dew of grief falls on My bud of joy again. It shall not be! Where shall I find her? At the Chapel? Speak! Fernando I think you will. It is about the hour. Sir Ronald Then show me to the chapelâquick! Fernando No useâ The gates are locked. Sir Ronald Then show me to her house. Comeâdo not tarry here. My life is thine. Why do you linger thus? Fernando You are in love. Sir Ronald In more than loveâmy heart is now on fire! For know, my soul was linked to her by ties Of undissolving love! As two young plants, With seeds alike, are grafted into one, But yield, according to each differing germ, A different kind of fruitâso were our hearts. Her absence is the sepulchre of all My joy! Fernando And hers the epitaph of mine. Sir Ronald I was a part of every thing that was, Of which she was the spiritâshe the all Of every part of every thing that was, To me. But look, Francisco comes! (Enter Francisco) My friend! Monk What do I see? Are you alive or dead? The real Ronald, flesh and blood, or are You, what the rest have been, what you are not! Sir Ronald I am just what I amâjust what you see. Monk Then you are different from the rest of us; For we are not what we appear to be. (To Fernando.) Are you a man, a woman, or a ghost? Fernando I am much nearer Death than you. Monk Were you That king, himself, I would not be surprised. Fernando We are the playthings of our fate! We live, And dieâand thus an end of us. Monk We then Begin to live. We shall exist in truth, And not as phantasies, as we do here. Fernando Look here! What think you of the soul? Is it A mere traduction from the parent plant? Monk No, it was bornâborn of the breath of God, So Job affirms. Fernando Think you that any thing, Derived can live forever? Monk Ay, it can, If he who made it, wills it so. Fernando Where think You love was born? Sir Ronald Its birthplace is the heart, Fernando They say it has no eyes. Monk 'Tis Argusâeyes; Of all things felt, not seen, it has most power. Sir Ronald It lives through all eternity, which is The lifetime of Love's GodâGod's loveâ For in the circle of his love it dwells, A boundless circle in a circle. Fernando Trueâ A circle is the nearest to its form. Monk It must be roundâit keeps me on the round. Sir Ronald Where is the Prince? Monk I hope he has not changed, And if you are Fernando, as you seem, And not another, I have news for you. Fernando There is but one thing that I wish to hear, And, that is, that my Madalena lives. Monk Then you shall hear most joyful news. She lives Now in the convent awaiting thy return. Fernando What, now? Monk Even now. Fernando Why were the gates kept locked? Monk For reasons reasonlessânow all explained. Fernando Ah, ravish not my heart with too much joy! But is she well? Monk She is most wellâbut sadâ Expecting thy return so long delayed. For you, Sir Ronald, you have come in time To see your Madalena veiled. Sir Ronald What is The hour? Monk One hour from this. Sir Ronald I thank high Heaven Fernando As we were friends in grief, so let us be In joy. Sir Ronald Away, there is no joy for me! (Exit.) Fernando Nay, Ronald, stay! You will not find the way! No, he is gone. Oh, you have filled my heart With too much joy. Come, we must seek her now. (Exeunt.) Scene IV (The interior of the chapel of the Convent of Santa Maria della Pieta. Charles Stuart, Flora, and his daughter in the attire of a Nun, on the left hand in the foreground of the crowd. The Madre, Angela, and Madalena on the right. The Officials walk to and fro swinging the Censors. A procession enters from the back of the stage, chanting solemn music. The lights of the High Altar are extinguished, but the chapel remains illuminated. As the Priest enters the music ceases. Priest (Taking Madalena's hand) Is it your own free will that you resign The world? Madalena It is. Priest Your own free will alone? Remember, you become the Bride of Heaven. You are to look no more upon the things Of earthâyou are to be Heaven's bride alone. If there is any thing you love more than You do this Heaven, you should not take the veilâ For nothing can absolve you from it then. Speak, is it so? Madalena It is. Priest Then, from the brow, All radiant now with thought, must these dark locks In rich profusion, now be clipt. Kneel down. Madalena (Kneeling) The sweet little bird of my hope is gone, Pillowed away up in the peaceful sky Upon the beautiful wings of his soul! (As he gathers her locks in his hand to cut them off, Sir Ronald enters.) Sir Ronald Hold, hold thy hand! these locks are mine, away! Madalena (Rising and embracing him) Oh, Ronald, Ronald! Is this you? Sir Ronald It is. Madalena My own dear Ronald! And he lives, he lives! Sir Ronald And loves thee still. Madalena I know he does, he does! Charles Stuart The hand of Providence is here. Flora These are The fruits of love. Charles Stuart Now there is joy indeed! Sir Ronald Ay, joy of joys! My heart is circumposed With joy! Charles Stuart Now are we kings indeed! Flora And queens My lord. Madalena Ay, joyful queens all crowned with loveâ Far richer than the Caledonian crown. Sir Ronald How have you been? Madalena Right sick at heart, but now Quite well. Charles Stuart Now my happiness is complete. (Enter Francisco, the Monk, Fernando following him.) Monk Make way for young Fernandoâlet him come. Madalena (Embracing him) Fernando, is it you? Fernando My own sweet bird! Madalena Where have you been? Fernando In search of thee! Charles Stuart Now, both are oneâboth mine. Sir Ronald (embracing her) My wife! Madalena My king! Sir Ronald Oh, if my soul was ever filled with love, Or ever valued virtue for its sake; If ever mortal felt immortal joy, Or drank new pleasure from the cup of bliss, I feel it nowâfeel it with all my soul. (Curtain falls.) End of Act Fifth Leoni, or the Orphan of Venice. A Tragedy in Five Acts By T. H. Chivers, M.D. When I was a student of Medicine in Transylvania University, some person gave me a pamphlet containing the Confession of Beauchampe, who was condemned to die for the murder of Colonel Sharpe of Kentucky. I then made a sketch of the outlines of a Play which I intended to write upon that remarkable occurence; but before I had finished it, some person took the pamphlet away from me, and I then wrote the following play. Any person acquainted with that unparalleled circumstance, will see, at once, that the play is based upon it, and that the catastrophe is the same.âThe young lady who was seduced by Colonel Sharpe, and afterwards married to Beauchampe, will be recognized in the character of Leoni. Beauchampe, who was instigated by her to kill Sharpe, will be recognized in the character of Alvino, and Sharpe, in that of Count Alvar. The Scene of the action, and the names of the characters are only omittedâthe spirit is the same. The creation of the other characters, and the construction of the plot, are my own invention. THE AUTHOR Philadelphia, November 8, 1851. Dramatis Personae Men Count Alvar, Leoni's seducer, afterwards married to Theresa. Don Carlos, friend to Leoni, and brother to Elvira. Alvino, cousin and husband to Leoni. Don Pedro, friend to Count Alvar. Count Rodolph, father to Theresa, and one of the Duke's Council. Duke and his Council. Officer and Guard. Women Leoni, Orphan of Venice. Elvira, her friend. Theresa, wife to Count Alvar. Act I Scene I A magnificent apartment in the palace of Count Alvar. Enter Count Alvar and Leoni. Count Alvar You know what pains most people take to lie. What said Elvira on thy quick return? Leoni She bade me keep the face of Virtue bright. Count Alvar That means that thou shalt shun my company? Leoni Nay! give me but one atom of thy love, And like the healing medicine of old, 'Twill cure the heart that thou hast wounded so! For there are priceless joys along our pathâ They scatter now their rich perfumes to Heaven. Count Alvar I cannot swallow down Elvira's words. (Starting away.) Leoni Nay, stay but one sweet moment, that my life May not be darkened longing for thy love! The Dove will love but one fond mate through life, And if the fowler's hand should lay that low, Thou mayest at noontide in the sultry sun, When wanton zephyrs play around her wings, Stand auditor beneath the much loved pine, And hear her plead the merits of his causeâ 'Twould lend affection to the hardest heart! Count Alvar My soul must link itself with larger views Than with Leoni's love. Leoni What! sayst thou so? Would'st thou betray the trust reposed in thee, For that poor paltry recompense called pride, And drive me loathesome from myself and Heaven! Count Alvar (Aside.) What if the link that bind me to the world, Should break in nature's chain? 'Twould let me down To dark nonentity with Devil's damned To rise no more! But Gods! It must be done! (Aloud.) So now, Leoni, fare thee well! Leoni What! now? And break the chain that binds me unto Heaven? Count Alvar If that will break it, it must break. Leoni And you, Have sworn this from your heart? Count Alvar I have not swornâ But it must be. Leoni So, you will leave me now, And yield me for another's love. Count Alvar I must. Leoni Then, by the eternal Gods, there is no hopeâ No recompense beneath the sun! Count Alvar There isâ Go, marry with your cousin now in Rome. Leoni I thank thee for that noble thought, my lord! I thank thee for that thought! for after this, Methinks the wretched lies that thou hast told, Will make each second of thy dying life A thousand years of misery! Hear me now! (Dashing away her jewels.) I would not wear another gift of thine, If every hair upon thy head were gold! But this fond heartâso full it fain would burstâ That would not harm the simplest thing on earthâ As both to scorn as fierce to insult givenâ (Until despite is on its honor thrown!) Shall turn an August for thy dying life, And thirst for every drop that fills thy heart! So now, farewell! (Weeping.) Count Alvar Leoni, fare the well! (Exit Count Alvar.) Enter Elvira. Elvira Leoni, why have you been shedding tears? Leoni My soul is full of sorrow and my heart Is crushed beneath the mountain of my woes! Elvira Count Alvar has deceived you then! Leoni He has, And bitterly shall he repent the deed! Elvira Perhaps he loves Theresa better then? Leoni An enemy to virtue, love? Tell me That Heaven is Hell! that he will go to Heaven! The mountains' heights are ascertainedâthe seas Are fathomed, and the oceans' depths are knownâ The Heavens are fettered by material spaceâ Revenge in woman hath no limitations! Elvira Revenge? Why talk you of revenge? Leoni 'Tis sweet! I tell you there is in my breaking heart, A chronic sorrow most incurable! A fell disease, unequalled by the worst Of all contagions, striking to the soul! Then mark me well! Keep this, my secret hate, As silent as the grave confines the dead, And go to Carlosâtell him that my soul Desires that he should watch the perjured Count, And then report to me what he may see Between Count Rodolph's daughter and himself. Elvira I will. It shall be done this very night. (Exit Elvira.) Leoni And now, by yon eternal sun that rolls His chariot through the confines of the sky; And every star that gems the arch of Heaven, I swear that never shall my soul find rest, Until the purple mirror of his blood Reflect the deep damnation of his deeds And make Seduction stare him in the face! (Exit.) Scene II A magnificent apartment in Count Rodolph's palace. Enter Count Alvar and Theresa. Don Carlos enters, unobserved, behind them. Count Alvar The air is filled with freshness from the sea, And all the winds seem laden down with balm. And now, Theresa, blessed of my heart, How sweet to trace the outlines of thy face, And drink the living music of thy voice, Whose tones first taught me what it was to love! How sweet to hear the softness of thy sighs, And fold thee gently on my bosom thus! (Embracing her.) Theresa When next we meet, my lord, this hand of mine Will have the privilege of grasping thine In everlasting love. Count Alvar Then shall thine eyes, Twin-born divinities, gaze into all The secret sanctuary of my soul, And learn the richness of my love for thee. Don Carlos (Aside.) That voice reminds me of my native land. Count Alvar (Observing him.) What brought you here? Don Carlos (Aside.) Foul fiend! (Aloud.) When that is told, Thou wilt not hate Leoni's love. Count Alvar (Drawing his sword.) Begone! Theresa (Preventing him.) What, would you have his blood upon your sword? Count Alvar (Putting up his sword.) No, by the Gods! Retire awhile, farewell! (Exit Theresa.) Well, Carlos, stealing on me as thou hast, What business have you with me at this hour? Don Carlos (Aside.) If that is not the everlasting voice Which drowned the music of my soul, there is No discord in the language of the damned. (Aloud.) I come as some dark whirlwind from the sea, Crushing the oak amid the silent woods, When from the forest boughs the morning dew, Is shaken by the mighty sound in rain. Count Alvar Who made thee bearer of such wondrous news? Don Carlos Leoni, she who was betrayed by thee! Count Alvar What could have urged her on to this extreme? Don Carlos Revenge! Ay, deeper than thy perjury, And stronger than the whirlwinds of the sea! Count Alvar Then go, foul braggart! tell her that the down Upon the turtle's wing were better armed Against the furious hurricane!âRevenge! Don Carlos You know that schoolboy friend of hers, Who means to marry her on his return? Count Alvar By heavens, if that is all, he will do well. Don Carlos By Jove, that is not all. He will do well! Count Alvar (Aside.) He will do well. By Heavens, he is too bold! There must be something devilish in his talk. (Aloud.) What, heard you Leoni was his bride? Don Carlos I did not come to tell you what I heard. Count Alvar I trace the outlines of some devilish deed, Upon the marble of thy lofty brow. Don Carlos But if Count Alvar would advise me how To shame the Devil of the mask he wears, I would unfold to him the foulest crime That ever stained the Annals of the damned. Count Alvar Foul crime! Will Carlos tell me what he means? Don Carlos With joy if you will listen to my tale. Count Alvar I will with all my heart. Speak on. Don Carlos Then mark, It was the gentlest of those summer eves, When day stood pausing on the hills of Spain, That, wandering through the orange groves alone, I met Almeda coming from the sea- A sweeter spirit never came from Heaven. She stood so sinless that you might have plucked Perfection from her lofty brow. Count Alvar And thenâ Don Carlos As innocence hath ever done, she sought Protection, due her gentler sex, within My arms. Count Alvar Which bore her soon away. Don Carlos I did, Alas! Count Alvar And married her that night. Don Carlos I did. But Gods! it ended sooner than 'twas done. Two years had scarcely told our hopes were crowned, When late one night about the hour of ten, A villian came tapping upon my door, And waking her from slumber by my side, Playing upon his lute, won her heart. She rose like Venus from her downy sea, And leaping in his arms with frantic joy, There, Devil-like, forgot that she was mine! Oh, God, such earthquake vengeance rent my heart, I chased her Paris with Achille's speed, And like another Grecianâ Count Alvar Stabbed him dead! Don Carlos No, by the eternal Gods, the villain lives! Count Alvar And did she die? Don Carlos I neither knew nor cared. I left my perjured Helen from that hour, A jewel worn upon my breast in joyâ And from that fatal hour, now twenty years, I have not seen my childhood's native land. Count Alvar And did you ever learn that villain's name? Don Carlos I didâalthough he traveled in disguiseâ A Florentine, who courted with his lute, And oft repeated songsâwho never knew Nor cared what garment virtue wore, so he Could win her by the sorcery of false smiles, To his lascivious arms. Should he not die? By Heavens, the answer stifles in thy throat! Count Alvar Away! Don Carlos Count Alvar, thou shalt die tonight! (Exit.) Count Alvar Tonight, by Heavens, the villain said tonight! As if there were no time to die but night! The reed that cannot stay the torrent's course, Must die beneath the glory of its force. (Exit.) Scene III A magnificent apartment in Don Carlos' palace. Enter Leoni, attended by Elvira. Let nature reinstate herself again. The past in happiness has gone forever, And lends the present only sterner grief. We cannot feel the joys we have enjoyed, And only know the joys we now enjoy. Leoni The fiery blood leaps through my burning brain, And there enkindles thoughts too wild too nameâ Foul, murderous thoughts! Elvira Thy vengeance then will seek The villain throughout all the world? Leoni It will; And finding him will open every vein, And filling each foul tube with molten lead, Shall hang him up for mockery to the world, Till he has grown so old in ugliness, That every fowl that soars through Heaven shall scream, And every wolf stand howling at his course! But did your brother watch him to my wish? Elvira He did. He has more in his heart against The Count, than ever entered thy soft soul. Leoni Then he has watched the fiend for something more Than friendship for an injured girl? Elvira He has; But every fibre of thy tender heart Will echo back the justness of the cause. Leoni The cause? What cause is that? Elvira Revenge! revenge! But see, my brother comes. Enter Don Carlos Don Carlos Leoni weeps Would that my hand could stay those gentle tears. Leoni Ah, know you not some way to wipe them off, And make the cheeks of poor Leoni smile? Don Carlos If I could muster in my faithful soul A single thought that would, when called to act, Be beneficial to thy injured cause, I would devote the remnant of my days In exercising it for thee! Leoni Then mark, I would not have him chronicled on earth, But have thee dip thy dagger in his blood, And write upon the tablet of his heart The fulness of the vengeance of my hate. Don Carlos Then glut the hunger of my own revenge! But then his wifeâ Leoni His wife? Don Carlos Ay, wife, by Heaven! Leoni Then you have seen her with the Count. Don Carlos I have; And told him if every hair upon His head were gifted with ten thousand lives, And every life were punished by the inch Through all eternity, that he would not Repay you for the injury he has done. Leoni But why not blast him to Theresa's face! Don Carlos I would have told her of the blackest crime That ever lashed the groping soul to Hell, Had it not been that, when he drew his sword, She spat upon me with her words and said, âWhat, would you have your blood upon his sword?â As if she looked upon me with disdain! Then pity, that moment, left my heart, And such eternal vengeance took its place, I said, âNow may his pestilential breath Contaminate the air in which she lives, Breed foul consumption in her honored blood, And rot her bones through all eternity!â Leoni Then, in the name of all that is most dear, Let not another day roll round! Don Carlos But stay! What if she heard me tell him he would die? Leoni Well, did you say it, Carlos? Don Carlos Yes, I did. And sorry am I that the word was said. Leoni Why so? Alas, all false! Don Carlos You called me false! How false, Leoni? Leoni Puerile as the child, That over-fed will vomit in its sleep. I thought thou wert the thorn among the flowers, Who stood to wound the hand that came to pluck The rose. But, like the Dead Sea Apples, thou Hast won upon my appetite to taste The hope that turns to ashes on my lips! Don Carlos By Jove, you wrong me! Leoni Then, revenge thyself! Revenge thyself upon Theresa's lord! Wait not another dayânot even an hour! Don Carlos I told the villain he should die tonight. Leoni Then let it be tonightâthe dead of night! Don Carlos Nay, wronged Leoni, that would never do. She may have heard my threat, which, if she did, Such foul suspicion would be fixed upon Me from that hour, that all would say at once, â'Twas Carlos killed the Count!â Noâmark me now! Let not the fragment of an evil thought Give utterance to the breathing of his name, And write Alvino to return from Rome. Leoni Alvino, call that blessed name again, And let the music settle in my soul, And tune the discord of my broken heart To childhood melody! Don Carlos And when he comesâ Leoni The Countâ Don Carlos But let no human being know That Carlos ever knew the Countâ Leoni Shall die! I thank thee for that blessed thought, good friend! I thank you for that thoughtâCount Alvar dies! (Exeunt omnes.) Curtain falls. End of Act First. Act II Scene I. The same apartment in Don Carlos' palace. Enter Leoni attended by Elvira. Elvira Ah, Leoni, why should sorrow weigh So heavily upon thy heart? Come, speak. Leoni If an unbroken trust in human truth, Prompt the pure soul to its idolatry; And if the heart in its fond, gushing love, Pour out itself to one no less than self, And in its trusting innocence become The victim of that villain's powerâshould it Be called the harlot of that man? By Heaven! And by the heart that he has brokenâhe Shall die! Elvira Would not repentance urge thee on To some forgiveness, if upon the depths Of his great sacrilege be poured the balm Of penitence! Leoni No, that can never be. There is no stream of mercy in my soul. But now, from out the fountains of my heart, A tide of indignation rushes up, And mounting to my brain forever drowns, Beneath the wide oblivion of its roar, The voice of all persuasion. He shall die! Elvira The bird that soars the highest into Heaven, If once its wing is broken in its flight, Is only bruised the greater by its fall. And like the Angels that once were so pure, Will mourn the humbleness of its descent, Just in proportion to its flight above. Leoni I now remember when Alvino loved Me first, the first time that we ever met. The day was very beautiful. No cloud Was seen in all the vastness of the sky, But Nature seemed so much in love with Heaven, That she forbade the rustling of the boughs To wake the silence of her noontide joy! Elvira Oh, still this sorrow of thy gentle heart, And like the priceless diamond in the mine, Tossed by the earthquake into purity, Suffer the ills of life but now to add New particles of beauty to thy soul. Leoni Let not the tears of pity cease to flow Upon the wasting sands of this poor life! But let them fall upon each golden grain, As softly as an Angel's sighs upon The soul of Virtue dying by the hands Of enemies! Elvira Methinks that Nature heard, The awful sadness of that prayer. Leoni She did; And God has registered each word in Heaven. Elvira If that be so, why should the God of Heaven Not punish him for guilt? Leoni He willâthrough us. (Exeunt severally.) Enter Don Carlos and Alvino, as in conversation. Don Carlos Before High Heaven, Alvino, it is true! I could divulge to thee the foulest news That ever hung upon the lips of truth. Alvino What news is that? Come, let me hear it now! Don Carlos Since thy return thou hast not heard the news Which float about like chaff upon the wind, Whichever way it choses to blow? Alvino No, Gods, You speak as if some devilish deed had come To light again! What is the matter now? Don Carlos Trueâif some devilish deed had not been brought To light, these hands had not been proffered in The cause. You know Count Alvar, do you not? Alvino He was the guardian of my youth. In Spainâ Don Carlos He traveled in disguise, and still he was The guardian of thy youth! Then watch the dog, And show the villain thou art old enough To teach him honesty! Alvino Thou wouldst impugn Him with thy very wrath! Don Carlos I would, by Heaven, And cut the rascal's throat besides. You know, Leoni, do you not? Alvino Leoni? she Who was the playmate jewel of my heart? Thou hast beheld the straying Hart, with wild Exultant bound, leap from the azure hills, And rushing with impatient speed, dash where The silver Swan lay sleeping on the lake, And frighten her to Heaven? Don Carlos Ay, watched the Fawn, Bounding along the river bank at noon, Pause on the margin of the mossy brink To sip the cool, delicious wave that curled In dimpled eddyings near the shore, take fright At its own picture in the limpid stream, And dash away with wild, delirious bound, To where its mother watched it from the hill, As if it were too lovely for this world. Alvino So did Leoni look upon herself, And see too bright an object for this world. Don Carlos But now her cheeks are furrowed down with tears. Alvino With tears? Leoni has no tears! Don Carlos She has, And needs the strength of such an honest arm, To crush the wretch who made them flow! Alvino Why so? Don Carlos She is deceived! Alvino Deceived? Don Carlos Yes, by heavens, And by Count Alvar! Alvino The hound! She was the orphan cousin of our house. By Jove, he must have used some violent means! Don Carlos And if he didâwhich thou shalt seek to knowâ Not only tear the wolf-skin from his backâ Alvino But draining every life-blood from his veins, Winters of death shall blow upon his soul, And freeze up his existence into ice! The eagle that has roosted on the pine, Will shake his pinions on the pensive bough, And rising on the dewy breath of morn, Will speed him to the sun's eye gloriously, Nor heed the frozen armor that has weighed All night upon his snowy wings! Don Carlos Then shake Him from the altitude whereon he roosts, And let the clamor of his mighty wings Strike terror to the ear of Night! Alvino Night! night! Thou wouldst not have me kill him in the night? Don Carlos I wouldâsecure him in the dead of night, Then balance consequence with insult given! Pluck out the thorn that wounds Leoni's heartâ Stamping the adder underneath thy feet! Alvino (Seriously.) I would not wound the feelings of his slave; But if the chalice of my hopes, so full Of pure and perfect love be drained to the dregs, And I am forced to drink the wormwood leftâ By Heavens, my run-mad heart will quench its fire! For there are crimes which, when committed, call For aid which, when bestowed, would be but crime Itself wer't not for thisâthe shedding blood, As sacrifice, for orphan honor stolen. Don Carlos Then let the vengeance of thy burning heart, But cheer impatience on to swifter speed, Till grasping hold the dagger by its hilt, And seeing how its face will shineâthou'lt sheathe It in the foulest heart that ever beat! For such an absolution sweeps away The guilt that dyed the name of innocence! Alvino Till then, farewell! We may not meet again, Until Leoni listens to my voice. Don Carlos Farewell! May all the Gods defend thy steps! (Exeunt severally.) Scene II A magnificent apartment in Count Alvar's palace. Enter Count Alvar and Don Pedro. Count Alvar Then answer me, who was the greatest friend That ever helped thee in the hour of need? Don Pedro I swear, my lord, Count Alvar, is the man. Count Alvar Do you believe this from your very heart? Don Pedro I do, if ever words came from my heart. Count Alvar Knowing that all thy words come from thy heart, I would divulge to thee the secretest thing That ever came from out the soul of man, And have thee keep it secret as thy own. Don Pedro I will, my lord. Count Alvar Then listen to me now. I have been taunted by the vilest foe, That ever mocked the royalty of pride, And I would have thee whisper in his ear The loudest vengeance that the voice of man Hath ever uttered to the soul. Be firm! I would not have thee suffer in thy heart A single sympathy to dwell. His bloodâ Don Pedro His blood, my lord? Whose blood? Count Alvar Thy face is pale. Now promise me before the Gods, whose frown Is darker than clouds above Olympus, That Carlos shall not live! Don Pedro What, must he die? Count Alvar And by thy hand! Don Pedro What, murdered by my hand? Count Alvar Thy hand! Don Pedro What for, my lord? Count Alvar The foulest blot That ever stained the dignity of man Will then be wiped away! Don Pedro Then he must die! Count Alvar Yes, plunge thy dagger in his cursed heart, And send him to the river of the dead! Be thou thyself revenged! Don Pedro Revenged, my lord? Count Alvar Ay, who has kept thee from Elvira's arms? Don Pedro Elvira? Carlos!âdamned as he isâ I cannot slay Elvira's friend. Count Alvar Her friend? What, cannot take the life of him who robbed Thee of the sweetest joys on earth? Oh, fool! Don Pedro The sweetest spirit ever sent from Heaven, But will the death of Carlos make her mine? Count Alvar It will. She would be with thee even tonight, If it were not for him. Don Pedro Then he must die! Count Alvar Swear, then, that thou wilt take his life! Don Pedro I swear! Count Alvar Remember that his destiny is death! Don Pedro It shall be done, my lord, farewell! Count Alvar Adieu! (Exit Don Pedro.) Now, if he is the soldier that he seems, And loves Elvira as he says he does, And only serves the wishes of his heart, And he has served the prompter of its ire; The savage that has prowled along my path, Will find the depths of my revenge so deep, He will not seek to lavish out his own! (Exit.) Scene III The same apartment in Don Carlos' palace. Enter Leoni meeting Alvino. Alvino Leoni! Leoni (Embracing him.) Oh, Alvino! Alvino Speak again! I love to see thee shed such anxious tears. They speak the language of thy virgin soul, Shed lofty fervour round expectant joy, And make the pathway of my purpose bright. Leoni (Weeping.) Alvino! Alvino Speak, my love, tell me thy grief! Leoni There have been strange vicissitudes to damp The ardor of my spirit, since we met. I have no resting place beneath the sun. Alvino What, cannot he who loved thee in thy youth, Find recompense enough for thee? Say, love! Leoni Alas, Alvino! Alvino Carlos told me all! I would not have you name it for the world! I only want the whispers of revenge! Leoni Revenge? The sweetest music to my soul That ever calmed the discord of my heart! Then you have swornâ Alvino Destruction to his soul! Leoni And thou wilt keep that promise to the last? Alvino The latest moment of my life, if thou Wilt only promise to be mine! Leoni Not thine, Nor to bestow this hand on mortal man, Until my woes are baptized in his blood, And this poor life redeemed by loss of his! Alvino The mighty Gods have registered that oath Upon the shining Adamant of Heaven! Leoni And thou wilt dip thy dagger in his blood, And send him with the legacy to Hell! Alvino As sure as yonder sun will ever set! Leoni Let not reluctance weigh upon thy purpose, Be buoyant as the Turtle on the wing! Take thou this Dove into thy bosom's Ark, Who brings the Olive-leaf of peace to theeâ And let her sorrows make thee more than bold! Alvino But will the crystal mirror of the lake, Enbosomed in the forest-girdled vale, Be wreathed the less by the tempestuous wind, Because the rosy-scented breath of morn Has settled on its pinions? No, my love! Leoni And lest one breath should blow him back his soul, And kindle life again, be sure to tramp The embers into ashes. Be not rashâ The thing should be well done. Tonight! tonight! Alvino This night shall be his soul's eternity! Leoni When it is done, return to me again. I'll wash thy bloody hands with tears of joy. Swear now before we part, that he shall die! Alvino (Kneeling.) Ye silver lamps, which hang tonight in Heaven, Ye auditors to God, whose beauty lights The glorious dome that canopies the world, I call upon ye from the dim abodes Of everlasting ether, to behold me now! In reverential awe, upon my knees, I offer up to you the holy vow That ever shall as sacrifice ascend From off the altar of my soul to Heaven! And now in the allotted duty which I owe myself, to nature and the world; I do devote the remnant of my days But to the shedding of that villain's blood! (Rising.) And now that his suspicion may not prompt Him to the coming of that dread hour; I must mature the purpose of my plans Amid the grandeur of the mighty hills, Whereon the thunders of the roaring winds Shall make dolorous music to my soul! (Exeunt omnes.) Scene IV A chamber in Don Carlos' palace. Don Carlos is lying asleep on his couch. Enter Don Pedro with a knife in his hand. Don Pedro (Approaching him.) Now then, he dies! He sleeps! Still as the dead! As if the silence of the grave were all That reigned around such sweet repose. Now thenâ But he should not be murdered in his sleep! For then his eyes will not behold whose hand It is that takes revenge upon him for His dear Elvira's sake! No, he must rise! Awake! thou murderer of my happiness, Arise! Don Carlos (Waking and rising.) What, Pedro! Villain that thou art! Who set thee on to this foul deed? (Wresting the dagger from his hand.) Don Pedro Hold! hold! And thou shalt hear! Don Carlos (Grasping him by the throat.) No, thou shalt die, with all The multitude of sins upon thy head! If thou hast any prayers to offer up To God's offended majesty, 'tis time The voice of penitence had cried aloud For mercy! Don Pedro Carlos, spare my life! Don Carlos To die A thousand deaths for every day you live! Don Pedro No, you shall hear it all! Don Carlos Then speak the truth! Don Pedro Count Alvarâ Don Carlos Devil that he is! Now die! (Raising the dagger.) Don Pedro Oh, Carlos, spare me for Elvira's sake! Don Carlos Elvira? Villain, call that name again, And thou shalt strangle in thy cursed blood! Don Pedro Count Alvarâ Don Carlos Pedro, utter not that name again Or all the elements that shake my soul, Will in consuming me destroy thee too! What is thy destiny? (Letting go his throat.) Don Pedro To do thy wish. Don Carlos Well, that will be to drown thee in the sea! Don Pedro But thou wilt hear the truth? Don Carlos Speak, then, the truth! Don Pedro I did not come to murder thee in sleep, But frighten thy compassion for the soul That loves Elvira. Don Carlos (Contemptuously.) Murderer for the Count! Don Pedro I would convey thy vengeance to his soul. Don Carlos That is, that you will kill the Count for me! Don Pedro If killing him would make Elvira mine. Don Carlos (Raising his dagger.) Then swear before this bright, uplifted steel, That should descend upon thee in revengeâ That thou wilt never serve Count Alvar more! Don Pedro I swear it from my heart, my lord, if you Will promise that Elvira shall be mine Don Carlos That choice is with herself. Don Pedro Then promise me That we shall see each other once again. Don Carlos It may be so. Don Pedro Then, by yon heavenly light, Whose beauty is the image of her eyesâ I swear to dedicate my life to thee! (Exeunt omnes.) Curtain falls. End of Act Second Act III Scene I. A magnificent apartment in Count Rodolph's palace. Enter Count Rodolph, Count Alvar and Theresa. Count Rodolph I understand Don Carlos was the man. Count Alvar He was, my lord. He had the impudence To chide me to my face. Count Rodolph Not in the street! Count Alvar No, in this very house, my lord. Count Rodolph By Jove, I would have crushed the villain where he stood! Count Alvar I would have slain the recreant in his tracks. Theresa, being nigh, prevented meâ Theresa I saw The fellow who addressed you yesterday With some strange accusation, which has been A puzzle to my senses ever since. Count Alvar NayâCarlos was not conscious what he said; And, doubtless, had been tasting, too much wine. Count Rodolph But had you no dispute before? Count Alvar Before, My lord? He had not seen my face before? Count Rodolph Perhaps he may have seen you when in Spain. Count Alvar He may have seen me casually in Spain. Count Rodolph But who was thy companion in the tour? Count Alvar Alvino, one who loved me well; a youth Of promise, who disdained the very earth He trod upon. He was a noble soul. But she, of whom Don Carlos spoke, was young Alvino's cousin. Theresa She it was, my lord, Whom Carlos mentioned when he said to you, I think, âThou wilt not hate Leoni's love.â And when you drew your sword upon him there, I saw him brighten with an evil fire, As if he wished he had his own with him, Which, having, there is no doubt he had used. Count Alvar I knew that well, therefore prepared for him, I told Don Pedro from that moment forth, To watch the prowling of the cursed wolf; And if he found him straying from his path, To cut the life strings from his iron heart, And dash him to the dogs! Theresa Then he is dead! I would not hesitate to swear that some Foul mischief is now breeding in the world! Count Alvar Oh yesâsome mischief. Some foul, devilish thought Is always uppermost in woman's mind. Theresa But has he not been absent now too long? You may depend upon it, he is not The man he seems to be. Count Rodolph It may be so; She may have seen more of his thoughts than you; For women oftener see more faults in men, Than they see in themselves. Count Alvar By Jove! What if He has beheld Elvira? Sight of her Would change the purpose of his amorous soul, And make the hardness of his iron heart As soft as down upon the turtle's wing, For love will cool the fever of revenge. Theresa Revenge, my lord? On whom? Count Alvar When Pedro comes The message of his mission will be read. Theresa Now written with an iron pen in blood! Count Alvar The fancies always paint some cloud upon The dawn of thine expectancy. Count Rodolph Revenge! Count Alvar That same infernal Carlos, whom our friend, Don Pedro hates, is brother to his love, Who, having sworn that they shall meet no more, Don Pedro swears that he shall die. That's all. Theresa May Heaven protect the innocent from harm! Count Rodolph Amen to that! Count Alvar (Aside.) Who cares, so Carlos dies. (Exeunt omnes.) Scene II The same apartment in Don Carlos' palace. Enter Don Carlos and Alvino. Don Carlos What is your wish? You have not told me that. Alvino Revengeârevenge as powerful as death. And greedy as the yearnings of the grave! Don Carlos The universal cry of vengeance isâ Revenge! that everlasting, bring hate Which oozes from the bottom of the soul And storms the passions of the heart to rage! But mark! the hardest whetstone to the edge Of our revenge, is Pedro. Alvino Pedro? Don Carlos Yes, The rascal's friend, Don Pedro, came within An ace of frightening me to death last night. Alvino Of frightening you to death? Don Carlos Indeed, he didâ Of murdering me in sleep! Alvino Most devilish fiend! Who set the coward on? Where is he now? Don Carlos We shall confer with him in private soon, He may be of especial use to us. There is some lying, to be done, you know, And he will fill that office to the life. I mean to instigate him to the death Of Rodolph, promising Elvira's hand, And then both murders will be fixed on him. Alvino The innocent will suffer for the guilty. Don Carlos What, Pedro innocent? Are you prepared? Alvino I am. Don Carlos Then mark me. Lodging in my room Tonight, which looks upon Count Alvar's house, Will save you from the watchmen in the streets, And hide suspicion. Therefore, go thou thence, And after you have sacrificed the dog Upon the altar of legitimate, revenge, Return back from the palace of the dead, And lodge there all night. Now, mind the storm, And navigate your vessel through the sea, As though you this pilot at the helm; And when you shall approach the happy shore, The far-off scenery bristling on the sky, Will seem Elysian Gardens to the soul. Alvino The traitor then will have no home. Don Carlos Farewell! Take lodgings in my room tonight. (Exit Don Carlos.) Alvino Farewell! Who knows how soon man's nature may misgive. But stronger than my fear is my revenge. Ye Gods, support me in that trying hour, Which is to set an everlasting seal Upon the soul of him whose life is death, And whose eternal destiny is Hell! (Exit.) Enter Don Pedro and Elvira Don Pedro But are there still suspicions in his mind That Alvar sent me to destroy his life? Elvira There are although your future conduct may Dispel the cloud which overhangs his soul. Don Pedro But would Elvira doubt her Pedro's word? Elvira The idea has not wholly left my mind. Don Pedro By all the Gods, at once dispel the thought! There is not in the vastness of my soul, A single thought that is not spent for him; And all the bright things of the living world, Are brightened in the presence of thy smiles! The fanciful array of odorous flowers Which deck the emerald mantle of the spring Whose perfumes, rising on the breath of morn, Float upward to the embrace of the sun, Are coloured by the beauty of thy smiles, And sweetened by the odor of thy breath! Elvira I tell you, Pedro, that my brother thinks Count Alvar sent you to destroy his life, And if he find you feeble in his wish, Or faltering in the purpose of his hate, His enmity will grow upon you fresh, But if he find you wedded to his soul, And quick to execute his simplest thought, Then will he look upon you as his friend, And treat you as if he had never been Aught but the friend that he will be to you. Don Pedro Such is the temper of his manly heart. But he who would deceive an orphan girl By blushes, silvered over with his tears, Would murder Carlos in the dead of night. But see, he comes! (Exit Elvira.) Enter Don Carlos. Don Carlos The hour will soon arrive. Don Pedro Is every thing prepared? Don Carlos Tonight! tonight! Alvino seeks him by the moon tonight. Don Pedro Then will his soul ascend above the stars. Don Carlos Ascend? Descend into the depths of Hell! But mark! There is one villain living yet, Besides Count Alvar, Pedro. He must die! Don Pedro Who can that be? Don Carlos Count Rodolphâhe that stands Against Alvino, if Count Alvar die. Now swear before high Heaven that he shall die! Don Pedro Then promise that Elvira shall be mine! Don Carlos I tell you, Pedro, she is free to choose, And thou art standing now above my soul, As does the unchanged thundercloud of Heaven. Above the parched lips of the cracking earth, And if thou wilt descend upon that fiend, The sweet refreshment of the stormy shower Will make the dearest April of my life. Now swear! Don Pedro I swear, my lord, that he shall die As surely as Elvira shall be mine. Don Carlos The oath is registered among the Gods! This way. (Going.) Don Pedro The Gods shall see the duty done. (Exeunt.) Scene III Time, midnight. In front of Count Alvar's palace. Thunder and lightning. Enter Alvino drest in dark clothes. Alvino Roll on, thou billowy trumpeter of night! And let the clamour of thy mighty voice Fill up the embrace of eternity! Spread out the groaning Hell-tones of thy bass, Until the mountains echo back your song, And scorch the foldings of the curtained earth, With thy cloud-breaking vengeance! (Ceases thundering.) All is still! Still as the awful silence of the grave! Now that the mantle, night, is thrown around The cradle, earth, whereon mankind reposeâ There is no time so suited to the deedâ No deed so hateful to the eye of day! But who shall wake him from that fatal sleep, And bring him back to consciousness again? Of all the periods in the Book of Time, There is no full stop to the human soul So awful in its nature as that point Which ends the final chapter of his life! For when we turn the last leaf over, we Behold the everlasting blank beyond The which is that eternity wherein No light shall ever enter to the damned! Now then, the villain slumbers for the last! Enter Count Alvar from the palace, not seeing him. Count Alvar! in the presence of the Gods, I call upon thee to defend thy life! Judgment hath come against thee in the world, And thou shalt liquidate thy last account! The fiery fingers of the fiends of Hell Can only grasp the pages of thy deeds! Think of the beauteous rose that thou hast plucked! And though it seemed to wither at thy feet, The thorn is here to stab thee to the heart! Count Alvar (Drawing his sword.) Alvino, is it thou? Alvino (Rushing at him.) Leoni! Die! (They fight.) Look on the vengeance of an injured girl! This very night thou shalt descend to Hell! Count Alvar Alvino, art thou mad? beside thyself? Alvino I have enough to make me madâto burn Up every atom of my raging blood! Count Alvar Alvino, mark the danger thou art in! Alvino Behold, my sword is thirsting for thy blood And it shall drink the river of thy life! Count Alvar Alvino, speak! The cause? Alvino (Rushing at him.) Leoni! Die! They fight again, when Alvino stabs him to the heart and he falls. Count Alvar Alvino, may the vengeance of the Gods Descend upon thee now! My soul is gone. (Dies.) Exit Alvino. Scene closes. Scene IV The same apartment in Don Carlos' palace. Enter Leoni. Leoni I have been waiting like the lonesome Dove, And still my comforter delays his time. What if the villain has been rash indeed? Enter Alvino Alvino, thou hast saved my tears! Oh, love! Did you not hear some sweet dolorous sound? It was my soul that went out audibly In search of thee, but never returned with thine. Alvino Oh, how the monster trembled at my sight! I called upon him to defend his life, And three times offered him this pointed steel, Which he as many times refused with his. I then stood o'er him, as the cypress mourns, Preaching his funeral with exalted wrath, Till like the willow twig snapt from its stem, I cut the brittle thread of life in twain; And left him weltering in his own heart's blood! Leoni Then he is dead, indeed! Alvino Yes, he is dead! Gone down to Hell, where all seducers go! Leoni Plunged you the dagger in his perjured heart? Alvino I did, but disinterred it o'er again, I would not let it rot in such a grave! Leoni (Embracing him.) Then I am thine, forever thine! Alvino 'Tis sworn! (Exeunt.) Curtain falls. End of Act Third. Act IV Scene I. An apartment in Alvino's house. Enter Alvino and Leoni. Alvino Now, we commence another path of thorns. Thou hast beheld the bark upon the sea, With swan-like majesty ascend the waves, And spreading out her penons to the winds, All pregnant with the glory of the storm, Plough on her journey for the destined port, But as she rises on the billowy hills, To see the forest bristling on the coast, When every heart beats gladly at the sight, Behold, the breakers of an angry sea Dash on the languor of her wave-worn sides, When shrieking to the mercy of the storm, She bows, once more in grandeur to the gale, And conquered by the rudeness of the blast, Sinks down an hour's sail of land. Leoni Oh yes, we have beheld all this in time, But why the downcast sadness of thine eyes In which there was so much of youthful joy, And love ineffable? Tell me the cause. Alvino A wintry fear lies cold about my heart. Leoni But did he not deserve to die? Alvino He didâ Ten thousand deaths! Leoni Then why regret the act? Is there not comfort in the downy arms Of her, who prompted thee to that great deed? And consolation in the happy thought That she would die ten thousand deaths for thee? Alvino There is, indeed. Leoni Then rest assured thou art The great avenger of an injured girl, Whose honor has been trampled on by one Who now inherits all the misery of his guilt In Hell's deep gulf, where hope can never come. Alvino You know that handkerchief I used to have? I left it on the bed where Carlos sleeps! Leoni Not where you slept last night? Alvino That very place! I have been thinking that if Carlos find It there, he will be false enough to swear 'Tis mine, if he is borne to prison. Leoni He? Alvino Yes, I am not suspected by the Count. I never showed Count Alvar any hate, But he has, threatening him with instant death. Leoni But if they find it there, will they not thinkâ Alvino That Carlos killed the Count. Leoni So let them think! Alvino And have him suffer for an act of mine? Leoni No, find some cunning means to set him free. By all the golden links that bind us in The chain of everlasting love, let not An outward show of honor ruin thee now. No, summon Pedro, if it should be so, To go to Carlos, when confined in chains, And hear the secrets of the then formed plot, And tell Don Carlos for his own soul's sake, By promising Elvira to be his To instigate Don Pedro to the death Of Count Rodolph. Then contrive some means When that is done, to set Don Carlos free. Alvino Oh, blessed women! Angel that thou art! Man says that thou art weaker than his sex; But what is lost in feebleness of limb, Is made up in the cunning of thy soul! For with one effort of thy dazzling thought In dangerous hours of fierce extreme, thy plans Can minister to his relief, when all His own have failed him in despair! Then let The Warriour on the battlefield think not To win the victory by his power alone, But seek some gentle creature, like thyself And ere the ramparts of the enemy Appear in living lines along the field, Commune in gentle earnestness with her, And he will gain more glory on that day, Than ever was the lot of one proud man. Leoni Then listen to the voice of one that loves. Alvino Well, let it be as thou hast said. Come on. (Exeunt.) Scene II The same apartment in Don Carlos' palace. Enter Don Carlos, Don Pedro and Elvira. Don Carlos So, he that was the gardner of the flowerâ Who plucked the sweetest rose that ever bloomed, And left the nectar of its ruby folds To perish in the stagnant winds of Heavenâ Has withered by the frost before the flower! Don Pedro What, has Alvino lashed him for the deed? Don Carlos I heard that he had murdered him last nightâ Although no one suspects he is the man. Elvira What, is it possible he is dead? I fear, dear Carlos you have been too rash! Don Carlos But no one saw me save his wife. Elvira Behold, who enters there? Don Carlos I need not doubtâ Elvira Alas, Then for your sister's sake, dear Carlos, fly! Don Carlos Why should I fly? Elvira They come for thee, away! Enter Officer and Guard. Officer Sir, by the oath invested in this writ, I am compelled to fetter thee in chains. Elvira In chains? Why bind the innocent in chains? Officer I am compelled to do so by the law. Don Carlos (Giving himself up.) It is your duty thus to do. Elvira (Taking his hand and kneeling.) Alas, And shall my brother die? We must not part. Don Carlos Arise, my gentle sister. We shall meet Again. (She rises) Elvira Perhaps no more on earth. Don Carlos We shall. And, Pedro, parting as the best of friends, I owe thee obligations, which shall live As long as thou shalt live to think of them. So, fare thee well! Don Pedro Farewell to meet again. Exit Don Carlos followed by Officer and Guard. Elvira Oh, Pedro, what will be our prospects now, Seeing the brightest of our hopes is gone? Can you not save him from that cruel death? Don Pedro And prove that Pedro is the friend of one Who called upon him in the hour of need? Then he who would not promise me thy hand, Shall have the joy of being saved by mine. Elvira He will consent. My heart, you know, is thine. Don Pedro Elvira, Pedro cannot lie to thee, For he has worshipped thee in all his dreams! And when the chambers of the night were hung With all the silver shining lamps that deck The azure palace of the glorious sky, Like roses blossoming in the fields of Heaven, He has communed in silence with thee. And think that Pedro can forget thee now? I swear, Elvira, Carlos shall be saved! Elvira Oh, Pedro, never did my heart believe That mortal man could be so true as thee! But see, Alvino comes. He looks not strange? (Enter Alvino.) Alvino I see, Don Pedro, Carlos is not here. Don Pedro He is not here for he is prisoner in thy stead. Elvira Alvino, if thou art the man thou art, I now conjure thee to be true to him! Alvino What, think you that Alvino will be false? The heart that urged him on to that great deedâ To mend the broken vessel at the fount, Which after ministering to his delight, Was thrown in wilful wantonness away, Shall be the prompter to restore his friend. Alvino will be faithful to the last. Elvira Then instantly release him from the chains! Alvino This letter shall be evidence of that I wish it, Pedro, to be borne to him, And after Carlos has divulged it thee, I wish an answer speedily returned. I would not trust another man on earth, And hope you will be faithful as The trust reposed in you. (Giving the letter.) Don Pedro It shall be done. I will be with him straight. (Exit Don Pedro.) Alvino (Aside.) The work is done! Elvira What was there in that letter? Alvino Pedro knows, Or soon will know, when it is read. Elvira But tell Me, what was in it? Alvino Know you not our plans? Elvira I know them not. Alvino Then you shall never know From me. Elvira Perhaps it may effect his life? Alvino If Pedro is the friend he seems to be He will divulge it all, when he returns. No woman ever kept a secret yet. (Exeunt omnes.) Scene III A prison. Carlos is discovered bound in chains. Enter Don Pedro. Don Carlos What, Pedro, is it you? What is the news? Does Carlos own thy heart? Don Pedro He does, my lord. And he is destinedâ Don Carlos Destined? Don Pedro To be free. Don Carlos Alas, those cherished hopes were almost gone. Don Pedro Amen To that! Alvino bade me hand you this, And wished an answer speedily returned. Don Carlos (Reading the letter.) Alvino? Is he faithful to the last? Don Pedro He wears the aspect on his brow full well. Don Carlos AlvinoâPedro, listen! swear that thou Art harder than the adamant of Hell, And thou shalt have the Jewel of my house! Don Pedro I am, to do the simplest thing for thee. Don Carlos Alvino instigates me here to prompt You to the murder of Count Rodolphâgo! That we may be as free as air againâ And bear this unsealed letter to him straight! And should he question you about its truth, Then show him, when the message has been read, This handkerchief he left upon my bed! (Giving him the handkerchief and letter.) Don Pedro If this will save thy life by risking mine It shall be done. Don Carlos It willâbe quick! Don Pedro Then swear Elvira shall be mine Don Carlos By Heavens, she shall! But go find Rodolph at the risk of life. (Exit Pedro. Scene closes.) Scene IV The same apartment in Count Rodolph's house. Enter Count Rodolph and Theresa. Count Rodolph The trial comes at the hour of three. Theresa But will he be condemned? Count Rodolph As sure as fate. But you will be required to swear that he, Don Carlos, threatened him with instant death. Leoni was the cause. Theresa Who told you so? I heard the thing from good men's mouths. Then, mark! The evidence against Don Carlos will Be truer than the truth, when that is known. Theresa Why so? Count Rodolph Because he killed him for that girl. Theresa But as Alvino married her, why did He not revenge himself upon the Count? Count Rodolph There is the mystery which will be cleared Of all its darkness when the truth is known, And brought before the Council. Who comes there? Withdrawâperhaps he may dissolve the doubt. (Exit Theresa.) Enter Don Pedro. Pedro (Bowing) My lord. Count Rodolph Don Pedro? Don Pedro That's my name, my lord. Count Rodolph Who saved you when the sentence of your death Was registered upon the Book of Fate? Don Pedro Count Alvar did. Count Rodolph Then why forsake that man? Why, rather than be faithful to your friend, Colleague yourself with that damned infidel, Who, laden with the heavy chains of State, Now reads his destiny among the dead? Don Pedro Because the trust reposed in me by him, Was sacrificed to gain another's love. Count Rodolph Who could be dearer to you than he was? Don Pedro My love for herâElvira's love for me. Count Rodolph No, thou art forging in thy cursed heart The lying words which hang upon thy lips, I will not suffer thee to live an hour! Don Pedro Hold, let me show thee to thy naked eyes, That Carlos is not guilty of the deed! (Handing him the letter.) Count Rodolph (Reading it.) Now tell me at the peril of thy life, If under any circumstance of hate, Alvino wished to instigate thee, by This letter to Don Carlos, to destroy My life! Don Pedro He did, my lord. He surely did, Leoni being prompter to the deed, This handkerchief was found upon his bed. (Giving him the handkerchief.) Count Rodolph Ye Gods, how eloquent is this poor thing! My ears are sated with its silent speech. It says more than the clamorous tongue of man, With all his liquid fluency of words! There is no evidence against his soul, Can speak so loudly as this drop of blood! Don Pedro And then his name is on the corner there. Count Rodolph Alvino, yes, it is most trueâ'tis here! And though he used the cunning of his soul, To keep the secret of the deed untold, Yet, he has spoken more by this same thing, Then if he had proclaimed it to the world. But goâtell Carlos he is free againâ Alvino shall be prisoner in his stead. (Exit.) Don Pedro And man may call me coward, if he will, But who would not, in such an hour as this, Lie boldly in the very face of truth, To gain possession of that woman's love! Since but to hesitate is losing all! Then, as my interest prompts me to the act, And as Elvira will be mine, if done, And happiness must follow, if she is, There shall be nothing to deter my power. (Exit.) Scene V The same apartment in Alvino's house. Enter Alvino and Leoni. Leoni So, of the handkerchief thou hast not heard? And Pedro has not yet returned? Alvino He stays, And by that staying brings me nearer death! Leoni Oh, say not so! He may have been detained. Alvino I must say so; there is no other hope. Leoni You do not think that Pedro will be false? Alvino If Carlos promise him Elvira's hand, He will betray to Rodolph all our plans, And then the sentence of the law will fall Upon us with avenging wrath! Leoni Most true! But cannot there be something done to ward Away this direful blow? Yes, let us fly! Alvino Leoni, it is best that we should stayâ Flying would only serve to prove our guilt, And give suspicion stronger claims to proof, And not remember in this trying hour, If any portent should retard our hopesâ Be strong as love is infinite! Leoni I will; And drink the last drop of the bitter cup, As freely as the first oneâto the dregs! But when is Carlos to be tried? Alvino At threeâ The Duke is sitting now in Council. Leoni Now? Then, let us fly! Alvino, why delay? The icy fingers of the hands of death Are tugging at my heartstringsânow thy pull, And stretch beyond endurance. Alvino Hush, my love! An officer is coming with his guard. Leoni Then, fly! Leoni will be with theeâfly! Alvino I cannot, dearest, all is over now! It is too late! Don Pedro has been false! And now, forsaken as we are on earth, Remember that we have two friends in Heaven. And as we are united here on earth, So let us be when we shall meet in death. Leoni In death? Thou wilt be dear to me then, Than thou hast ever been in life. No, love, They cannot separate us in this world! And, come whatever bitterness there may, They cannot do it in the world to come. For that which prompted me to hate the Count, Has only made me value thee the more, And love thee better in the hour of need. And, therefore, dying at whatever hour, The pleasure, that my life shall end with thine, Will blot away the terrors death may bring. But look, they come! Alvino Now, reconcile thyself. Enter Officer and Guard Officer Seize on him, Guard! Alvino (Drawing his sword.) Stand back, obedient dogs! Your mothers bore your fathers no such sons. In Lombardy the Axeman says, that when The storm is raging loudest on the hills, The tallest trees bend lowest to the ground. And I would spill thy blood upon the earth Like rain! (To Leoni.) Now like the Persian Shepherd, when He wandered through the Desert of the East, And, from the wilderness beheld the glimpse Of Arem's Gardens, never to behold The beauty of that paradise again, So do we turn away from all things dear, And from the radiant vision of that hope Whose glory burst upon us yesterday, To gaze upon the icy shape of Death! (Turning to the Officer.) Bind me in chains! (They bind him.) Leoni Oh, ye of little souls! Have ye in office love to show your power! I do despise you from my very soul! Alvino (Aside to Leoni.) Leoni, recollect the vow we made! (To Officer.) Now we are ready to abide the law. Leoni And if the Duke's decision be thy death, The sentence of thy guilt shall be my death! For if the life that is in thee shall die, The dying of that life shall be my death! Alvino Leoni, that has sunk deep in my heart! (Exit Alvino and Leoni, attended by Officer and Guard.) Scene VI The same apartment in Don Carlos' palace. Enter Don Carlos to Elvira. Elvira Don Carlos, are you free? Don Carlos As free as air. Elvira Who set you free? Don Carlos That letter which our friend, Don Pedro, brought to me. Elvira Then, Carlos, let Revenge now sleep. Don Carlos It has been sleeping longâ Just now waked up, never to sleep again! Elvira You hate him still. Reward him for his pains. Don Carlos I will reward him for his pains! He is My creditor vast arrears. The debt, If nothing happens, will be paid today! He lent me ruinâI mean to pay himâdeath! Elvira Where go you now? Don Carlos I go to do my work! The raging fever of my heart for years, Parching my soul with an immortal thirst, Will soon be medicined to coldness now. The last Act of the Drama then will close. With the redemption of my noblest friend. (Exeunt severally.) Scene VII The Council Chamber. The Duke and his Council assembled. Enter Alvino attended by Leoni, and followed by Officer and Guard. Enter, afterwards, Count Rodolph and Theresa. Count Rodolph (With a paper in his hand.) My Liege, before you for an awful crime, The murder of Count Alvar in the night, Alvino stands accused of that foul deed! That he was murdered in the dead of night, When God's all-seeing eye alone could see, Is sworn to in this sacred writ of mine. And that the murderer stands before you now, Is proven by this letter, which he sent To Carlos by Don Pedro when in chains, To prompt him to the taking of my life. And by this handkerchief which you behold, Which Carlos said he found upon his bed, The which, if not sufficient to convict, Shall be confirmed by evidence of both. Duke (To Officer.) Then bring them forwardâthey shall both be sworn. (Exit Officer.) Alvino, if you have a word to say, Against the evidence adduced, speak out! My liege, that innocence may plead, without Disguise, her own truth-telling cause, there is No more than truth in what the Count has said. That in the dead of night Count Alvar fell, When some life-taking hand drove off his soul, And left him sleeping in the arms of Death, May all be true, but that this thing was done And by Alvino's hand, must yet be proven. Re-enter Officer, bringing in Don Carlos and Pedro. Count Rodolph Now, that the evidence may be adduced, I charge you, Carlos, by an awful oath, To say if this foul letter came from him. Don Carlos It did! Count Rodolph And that this handkerchief was found Upon his bed. Don Carlos It was. Alvino (To Carlos.) Oh, man! Frail man! When thou art false, thou art, indeed, most vile! There stands the injured cause of all this guilt, A Sanctuary holyâperfectâpure! From that bright bush he plucked the sweetest rose That ever bloomedâwhose virtuous sweets he stoleâ Then spurned her, that she had no more to steal! The last soft tendril of the dearest vine That ever wreathed the pillar of affection! The rest are gone to an untimely grave! And, now that we are destined to that place, Where all our ills shall be forgottenâwe Shall be the first in this assembly who Shall covet no remembrance in this world. And now, whatever lot may fall on one, I crave this boon, that it may fall on both! Duke Alvino, that the law is blood for bloodâ That justice may be given to whom 'tis dueâ That human passion may rich lesson learnâ But more than all, that Heaven may be appeased, I now pronounce thy sentenceâit is Death! May all good Angels guard thee to thy home! Leoni Have you no tongue to speak the same to me? Oh, if you have, pronounce it nowâyes, now! Alvino (Aside to Leoni) Leoni, recollect the vow we made! Leoni (Taking a phial from her bosom and drinking.) What, think you Count Rodolph has the power To take revenge upon such love as this? Alvino (Aside to Leoni) Revenge! thou hast revenge upon them all! Yes, deeper than the depths of Heaven from Hell! (He takes the phial from her hand and empties it.) Leoni (Aside.) The sweetest death that ever mortal died! I have another friend, if that should fail. It sleeps beside the beatings of my heart, Counting each anxious sorrow, one by one! And when the curtains of dark night shall fall Upon the eyelids of the Dayâthe last Of all that is now spoken be known! Alvino Ye Gods, behold the power of my revenge And pity all that has been done in hate! End of Act Fourth. Curtain falls. Act V Scene 1. The same apartment in Don Carlos' palace. Enter Don Pedro and Elvira. Don Pedro Open thy bosomâtake me to thy heartâ And cage my soul there, where it loves to live, For, as the matchless Swan long from his home, Waits for the coming of the gentle Spring, To leave the sunny waters of the South, And seek the milder Summer of his own And rising from the languid blades at even, Soars through the untrod regions of the air, And from the pathless altitudes above, Descends upon the bosom of his home, And meeting with his fellows floats in joy; So hath my longing soul from day to day, Soared through the desertâbleakness of dark deeds, To gain possession of this longed-for joy. Elvira And Carlos lives to recompense thee now, For all the benefits bestowed on him, And see thee happy in Elvira's love. In giving thee my hand my heart is given; In yielding up my heart my soul is thine, And giving that there is no more to give, But that devotedness in after life, Which is the consequence of all my gifts. Don Pedro Then are the buddings of my earliest hopes, Expanded to the fulness of that flower, Which only decks the paradise of bliss. Elvira And now the pulse of Carlos is as calm As that most solemn pause in nature, when The silence doth succeed the raging storm. For there is not within his friendly heart A single pulse that beats beyond the time In which the sympathies of tranquil life Are chained in one harmoneous round of joy. But poor Alvino, fettered as he is, And doomed to suffer for an act so just, And poor Leoni, faithful to the last, It makes me sorry from my very soul. Don Pedro Is she permitted still to stay with him? Elvira She is more faithful to Alvino's love Than is the sunflower to the God of Day. For though it meet him at the rising morn, And follow him through all the weary hours, To the soft drooping of the languid West, At night there is no sun to follow then; But through the weary hours of all the sun, And through the weary hours of all the night, Has she been faithful to Alvino's love. But see, my brother comes. How mild he seems! (Enter Don Carlos.) Don Carlos Don Pedro, in the presence of the Gods, I now present to thee the richest gem That ever sparkled in the mind of truth! And one that has been worn upon my breast For eighteen gentle summersâshe is thine! And now, as if the heavenly gift were made To be restored again at some blest hour, With all the richness of her present worth, I charge you to be dutiful to her, And cherish her with all the power of love, For she is thineâforever to be thine! (Uniting their hands.) And like the mountain rock forever more, Standing amid the brief decay of things, Robed with the greenness of its velvet moss, Which while it hides its inequalities, Gives beauty to the outline of its forms; May all thy years, while others fall around, Present the greenness of enduring youth! Don Pedro Then, Carlos, in this hourâthis single hourâ Thou dost behold more joy in Pedro's soul, Than ever lived in man. Give me thy hand! Don Carlos (Giving his hand.) Thou hast been faithful, Pedro, to the last, And for thine honesty shouldst have the girl, Therefore, the gift is thine, forever thine. For you, Elvira, you may wait awhile, I have some business with your lord, before Your wedding day! (Exit Elvira.) Oh, ye immortal Gods! How I do thank you for this hour, this hour Of all my life is sweetest to my soul! It sweeps away all former grief, as if It had not been. I thank you. Oh, ye Gods, One villain in the graveâthe other here! They should have both been tumbled in one hole, Rotting in death as they have lived in life! Don Pedro (Aside, much agitated.) I have foreboded this! What must be done? Don Carlos Don Pedro, come this way, come near to me! The Chalice which I offered thee just now, So full of perfect joy that it ran o'er, I dash to fragments on the Rock of Hell! Don Pedro Oh, Carlos, you are angry with me now! If I have wronged you, let it passâforgive! For I am sorry from my soul! Don Carlos Base fiend! Did you expect my sister's hand? That hand Which is as dear to me as life! Think you That I would give my sister to a fiend? Oh, cursed fool, I gave her thee, to show Thee, snatching her away, the cruel pangs Of unrequited love! She loves thee not, No, hates theeâhates thee as my soul does now! Don Pedro Oh, Carlos, kill me rather than say that! Don Carlos Kill thee? I mean to cut thee all to pieces! The splintery lightnings of the unsealed Heavens, Were snailpaced to the thunders of revenge! Don Pedro Think, Carlos, who has saved thy life? Don Carlos My life? My cunning, not thy treachery, or if It did, you should not live for it, but dieâyes, die! Nay, rather say, who stole my life? Who helped Count Alvar bear Almeda from my arms? Ah, tremble, tremble at my power! (Drawing his dagger.) Don Pedro (Kneeling.) Forgive! Have mercy on your friend! Don Carlos My foe, you mean! Did you have mercy on my heart, when it lay Bleedingâwithering at your feet? No, no! And do you ask forgiveness in this world? Do you expect it in the next? Don Pedro I do, And hope you will forgive. Don Carlos Hope not. There is no hopeâforgiveness none! Don Pedro Do spare my life! Don Carlos No, thou shalt die, guilt-spotted as thou art! Thou shalt descend to that infernal world, Where Hell's immortal dogs shall gnaw thy soul! Don Pedro Let me but see Elvira once! Don Carlos No more, Not in this world or the world to come! She shall not go to Hell, nor you to Heaven! Don Pedro Then, farewell world! Don Carlos (Taking him by the throat.) That was well said. Thy life! Don Pedro Oh, spare me but one hour, but half an hour! Don Carlos No longer than the impatience of my soul Can lead thee hence to instant death, come on! (Leading him out.) (Re-enter Elvira.) Elvira What, gone? Yes, gone, but where? Ah, by this time Poor Pedro's soul is on its way to Heaven! If not to Heaven, to that unfathomed gulf, Where all the sinful in this world must go. (Re-enter Don Carlos in haste.) Don Carlos Elvira, it is done! Elvira What have you done? Don Carlos Dispatched that devil's soul to Hell; downâdown! Where Hell's lank wolves, forever famished, howl, And bark obstreperous thunder round the damned! Will he not serve the devil there as here? What if my wife should meet him in that world? Would she not know him there as here? She would! If there is lechery in Hell, they have hot times, Count Alvar being there among the rest. Elvira I wish it had not been. Don Carlos Why so, what now? Elvira I fear I shall never find rest. Don Carlos What, are You better than I am? We need no rest! There is no rest on earth, nor peace, nor joy, Nor any thing that you should care about. Elvira I fear that I have sinned. Don Carlos You have not sinned. You are as guiltless as a newborn child. Elvira But then I promised to be his. Don Carlos How his? Don Pedro's wife? Then you have sinned indeed! For that your soul can find no rest on earth. I did not think that I could hate you so! Elvira Oh, hate me not, but do forgive, forgive! Don Carlos I have no time for parley now. Each grain Of sand that from the hour-glass of old time, Falls on the earth crowds on the life of one, Olympus high, which must be saved. Ye Gods! That through the vistas of long trying years, Have smiled upon my purpose to this hour, Look down upon me with propitious smiles, And aid me to achieve my greatest work. Elvira Where go you now? Don Carlos I go to save my friend. Elvira Farewell, may God have mercy on your soul! (Exit.) Scene II The same apartment in Count Rodolph's palace. He is seated by a table writing. Enter Theresa. Theresa When does Alvino die? Count Rodolph He dies at three. Theresa Where is Don Carlos? Count Rodolph He is free again. Theresa He should be free. He is a noble soul. Count Rodolph You talk of soul. Leoni has the soulâ She is All Soul! Theresa Does she remain with him? Count Rodolph She does. Theresa Think you she will die with him? Count Rodolph She will. Why should she live? She has no friends. And living friendless is but living death. Theresa To die, you know, is terrible to all. I question much if she will have the nerve. Count Rodolph A woman's spirit can do any thing I almost wish he had not been condemned, Or that he could be pardoned for her sake. Theresa That would not do. Then he would kill us all. No, he must die! There must be no reprieve! (Exit.) Enter Don Carlos Don Carlos Count Rodolph, is Alvino dead? Count Rodolph Not yet. Don Carlos When does he die? Count Rodolph At three. Don Carlos Thou liestâhe lives! Count Rodolph What do you mean? Don Carlos I mean he shall not die! Not while this arm has power to wield this sword! Count Rodolph No power can save his life. He dies at three! Don Carlos Then say thy prayers. Thou shalt not live an hour! Count Rodolph Are you insane? Don Carlos Insane as sanity Can make a manâdistracted for my friend! His life is in thy powerâhe must be saved! Count Rodolph My power? I cannot save his life! Don Carlos Then you Can die! Count Rodolph I am astonished at this talk. Don Carlos Astonished? Did you ever love your friend? Would you not die to save thy friend? Then die! He is thy friendâyes, everybody's friend. Count Rodolph How can I save his life? Don Carlos Do you not know? Give me the keys! Count Rodolph I have no keys. Don Carlos Then write me his reprieve. Count Rodolph I have no power to grant you his reprieve! Don Carlos Then sign the Duke's name to it. Count Rodolph Forge his name? Then I shall die for forgery! Don Carlos Better that, Then die so suddenlyâso unprepared! Count Rodolph (Writing.) Well, if it must be doneâit must be done. (Giving Don Carlos the paper.) Don Carlos Then by the Gods, he livesâhe lives again! (Exit.) Count Rodolph By Heavens, there is some mystery in this, And I must leave the city for my life! (Exit.) Scene III The interior of a prison. Alvino and Leoni are lying asleep, from the effects of the narcotic which they have taken. A noise, as from a crowd, is heard without. Leoni (Slowly recovering.) So, twilight visions gather round my soul, And Angels play about my couch tonight. Where is Alvino? Was it he that spoke? If it were Heaven, Alvino would be here. There are no sounds in Heavenâthere Angels sing. There Angels' songs are heard. There Alvino sings! Alvino (Slowly waking.) Leoni, darkness gathers round my soul. What gloom is this that overhangs my head? Oh, there are heavy things upon me now. Leoni, gentlest of revengeful loves, Look at these manly hands, all chained, yes chained As if my soul found music in their links! Oh, how they sing the requiem of my death! Leoni (Rising.) Thou hast redeemed me unto death with thee, The sweetest death that ever mortal died! To live without thee would be living death, To die with thee will be eternal life! This is the gate through which we pass to Heaven. We are not dead until we pass this gate. Alvino (Rising.) Oh, for the carol of that heavenly bird! The Nightingale that has complained so longâ Pouring the sweetness of her plaintive song To the deaf ears of an offending world. Sing on, sad bird, for those shalt sing no more! (Noise without.) Leoni! 'Tis too dark for Heavenâ'tis Hell! Leoni Look here, thou dost not see this precious thing? This was an Angel's gift. 'Twill couch all pain! Through all the fibres of thy manly heart, Send sleepâimmortal sleep! Send nightâdark night! And wake thy morrow in another world! (Noise without again.) Alvino What sound was that? The summons! We must part! Leoni We part? We will not sever in this world. I have a tale to tell too sweet for that! 'Twill send an anthem through thy very soul. It is too deep to fathom in this world! (Raising the dagger.) Here is one chapter thou hast never read. Alvino, this shall drowse away all life. 'Tis warm with that which it shall turn to ice! Alvino A little moment more, Leoni, thenâ Leoni I, who have been thy pathway to the tomb, Will be thy partner through the shades of death. This is the marriage banquet of our loves! Alvino, thou hast never known me yet. This world has never known fond woman's love. This is the place that lesson shall be taught, That he who ever knew Leoni's love, May love her that her love is woman's love! (Noise at the door without.) Alvino They come, Leoniâhold, thou canst not kill! Leoni What, cannot kill? The strength of death too weak? A lion's strength is weak to thisânow, come! (She stabs herself, hands him the dagger, and falls.) Alvino Now, that her own dear blood is on the blade, And she is waiting at Heaven's Gate for me, I cannot bear to stay so long from her! Leoni Alvino! (Dies.) Alvino Ha, she calls meâI must go! (Stabs himself and falls.) Leoni, see! Alvino comes to thee! (Dies.) (Enter Don Carlos in haste.) Don Carlos Gods, are they dead? Yes, they are dead, dead, dead! And I have come too late to save my friend! Oh, my Alvino, Carlos was your friend, And yet you died believing him your foe! Great powers above, where is my comfort now? Here, with Alvino, poor Leoniâdead! The Curtain Falls. End of Act Fifth.</field>
