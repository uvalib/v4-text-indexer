      <field name="fulltext">THE SISTERS OF SAINT CLARA. A TALE OF PORTUGAL. CANTO I. I. 'Tis the bridal of nature, the season of spring, When Pleasure flits round on her diamond wing, And the spirit plays brightly and softly and free, Like gem-dropping beams on a boundless blue sea, And the young heart is lit by the beams of love's eye, Like an altar of perfume by fires of the sky. 'Tis the heart-blooming season of innocent love, When the green growing mead and the whispering grove, And the musical stream, as it purls o'er the dale, And the flowers whose lips zephyr woos in the vale, Are seen with the spirit of thrilling delight As visions of beauty too passingly bright, And heard like the songs that come o'er us in dreams When the soul's magic light through infinity gleams. The gay Earth is vestured with verdure and flowers, And hope sings away the sweet sunny hours, While bathing in sunbeams, or over the sky Her star-pinions waving through glories on high. The citron groves throw on the wings of the breeze Their balm-breathing flowers, and the green orange trees Harp sweetly in airs from the hill and the sea, Like lyres heard unseen singing joys yet to be. O Eden of beauty! Lusitania! the sun Loves to linger a while, when his journey is done, On the lofty twin Pillars, whose brows in the sky Gleam bright when the sun-god rides flashingly by, Which stand in their might 'mid the waves of the sea— Abyla and Calpe—unconquered and free. And Cintra's dark forests look smilingly on Apollo descending from his chariot throne, While Estrella's lagoon, green Escura receives Sheen tints of his rays from the wood's gilded leaves, And Tajo's broad bay like a mirror reposes 'Tween a heaven of light and a garden of roses. II. The sun's last beam of purple light Blazons proud Calpe's castle height, And over Lusitania's sea Looks with a smile of melody. The volcan fires of Ætna glow, Brighter as sinks Hyperion low, And, 'mid the gathering twilight high Stromboli flames against the sky, O'er dark-blue ocean's billowy foam, To light the wandering sailor home. Child of the sun, the dusky Moor Watches the horizon, bright obscure, And, while the proud muezzin calls Devotion's hour from Ceuta's walls, Throws his keen eye's far-searching glance O'er the dark billows as they dance Along the Mauritanian shore, And listens to their surging roar Around Abyla's basement deep, Lest in tired nature's twilight sleep The foe upon his guard should steal, And gain the pass ere trumpet peal. Adverse, the gallant Briton's eye, From Calpe's height gleams o'er the sky, And marks with all a sailor's pride The vast sail gleaming o'er the tide, While every breeze that comes from far Wafts music from red Trafalgar. Evening's dim shadow o'er the close, Fair Lusitania! and the rose Of morning blushes o'er thy plains With the same rich and gorgeous light As when his warlike, wild Alains, O'er forest, flood, and vale, and height, From Volga's banks Respedial led To Tajo's darkly wooded shore, Though where they warr'd or why they bled None know or name forevermore. And the sun rolls his last faint beam O'er princely dome, rose-margined stream, And almond grove and jasmine bower, With the same smile as when the earth Blushed in the beauty of her birth. III. The full-orbed moon is gleaming bright On Cintra's dark and rocky height, And on verandah, turret, tower, Palace and fane at this still hour Glows with a radiant smile of love, And gilds the music-breathing grove With those pure beams of light serene, Which sanctify the peaceful scene. From wave and dome and field and grove Rise the soft notes of pleading love, And many a strain is heard from far Of wandering lover's sweet guitar, And in the songs he fondly sings His glowing heart finds rainbow wings, Which bear his spirit's powers afar Unto his being's guiding star. Dian—the queen of sighs and tears, Her richest robe of beauty wears, And smiles to hear the vows that rise Beyond her empire in the skies, While still she weeps, in prescient pain, That passioned love is worse than vain. IV. St. Clara's dark and massy pile, Where sunbeams fall but never smile, 'Mid the dense cypress grove uprears Its ivied turrets, gray with years, And, where the shadowy moonlight falls, Uplifts its blackened prison walls, Within whose solitary cells Tearless despair forever dwells, And sin, beneath devotion's name, Reposes in its sacred shame, While deeds 'twould sear the tongue to tell Are done in murder's fatal cell. Within St. Clara's cloistered gloom, A living grave, a vital tomb, Two lovely vestals, young and fair, In misery dwelt and dark despair. Their loves and hopes and feelings chained, Lone sorrow o'er their being reigned, 'Till hope arose upon their eye, And love's ecstatic witchery Woke the fond hearts that had been crushed, And the soul's sunlight current gushed. Like roses budding on one stem Or blending hues of opal gem, Lonely they sat within their cell, Silent till expectation's swell Burst o'er each thought and feeling high, Like sunshowers from the azure sky. Round them the full heart's stilness hung, 'Till Zulma's glowing feelings sprung To words that flowed like morning's beam, Or song from lips of seraphim. “Sweet Inez! fast the fearful hour “When we shall spurn monastic power, “Doth hasten, and our spirits' might “Must dare the ordeal of to-night. “The church's power, or father's ire, “And Heaven perchance, will all conspire “To cloud young love's ascending sun; “Then, Inez, 'til the deed is done, “And we have passed their power's extent, “Let not thy dove-like heart relent “Nor fancy picture punishment.” “Oh, lovely Zulma! hope is light “Within my trembling heart to-night, “And fain this bosom yet would prove “The silent joys of blissful love. “But, ah! my path in life hath been “So full of grief, and every scene “Of joy so soon hath changed to woe, “Life's common bliss I ne'er shall know “Till my lone heart hath ceased to beat “Within the snow-white winding-sheet.” On her pale cheek and blanching brow Hope's feverish hectic ceased to glow And o'er her bosom came the blight, The darkness of perpetual night, The gloom of days that long had vanished, And thoughts, that never could be banished. V. Zulma's high spirit at the view Of peril more undaunted grew, And glowed 'mid sorrow's gathering gloom Like angel faith above the tomb. In danger's hour she stood alone, 'Mid fearful things the fearless one, And, as her sunlight spirit burned O'er the deep darkness of despair, The trembling fears of all she turned To hopes, and left them smiling there. Her broad high brow the throne of thought, And features into spirit wrought; Her star-beam eye and face of light, And moulded form that chained the sight, And swan-like neck, and raven hair, And swelling bosom, richly fair, Which rose and sunk, like moonlight seas, In its deep passion's ecstacies, As if her mighty heart were swelling In sun-waves for its heavenly dwelling; All spake a spirit proud and high, A wandering seraph of the sky, And such was Zulma; sorrow's night Might its dark shadows o'er her cast. But the deep gloom her spirit's light Changed into rose-beams as it past; She had one aim, and none beside Could bend her lofty lightning pride, And, ere she drooped, she would have died. Vemeira knew his daughter well, And chained her spirit in a cell Ere she could know the desolate And hopeless woe of such a fate, And 'twas to bless an elder child He crushed that soul, so proud and wild. VI. Timid and fearful as the fawn, That searches ere it treads the glade, Yet lovely as a spring-time dawn In robes of rosy light arrayed; Warm, feeling, soft and delicate As the last blush of summer eve, Yet trembling at the frown of Fate, Lest, while her heart did sadly grieve, Sin should assume the garb of woe, And shroud in gloom devotion's glow; Inez, though fair as forms that rove Round Fancy's fondest dream of love, Was tender, gentle, fragile, frail, And shrinking as the violet pale Which blooms in solitary vale, By zephyr fanned and breathed alone, Unseen, unsought, unprized, unknown. Feelings suppressed and thoughts untold Flowed silently, like molten gold, O'er her fond heart, while virtue's sun Threw glory o'er them as they run. Her smiles and tears alike were born In purity of virgin love, And, like bright Eos, child of morn, She drank at streams that gush above: For sweetness such to her was given, Her faintest prayer was heard in heaven. VII. When Zulma heard her sister's plaint, And saw her gentle spirit sink, Her soul arose in power—“To faint “While standing on dark ruin's brink “Were madness worse than mirth in death “When love and bliss our flight await “To quail, to droop despair beneath “Were folly that deserved the fate.” “But if we fail”—“It cannot be! “Love, like the mountain breeze, is free, “And, amid peril, wrong and ill, “Strong as the gale that sweeps the hill, “Or severing ocean in its might, “Brings long lost treasures into light.” “But will beholding heaven approve “Our broken vows for earthly love?” “St. Mary shrive thee! would'st thou be “A vestal in hypocrisy? “Oh, gentle Inez, guard thy love! “Count Dion's daring quest would prove “But folly's dream in evil hour, “If thou dost spurn the boy-god's power.” Inez arose, her blue eye flowed In gushing tears of pearly light— “Zulma! my heart were ill-bestowed “If Dion called me false to-night.” “Vemeira's daughter still!—O Heaven! “Love's messenger his call hath given! “Inez! that rose, by Dion thrown, “Lay on thy heart—it is thine own— “And haste thee, for we must be gone!” The soft strain of a sweet guitar Now mellowed came as if from far, But, skillful in its measured fall, It rose by dark St. Clara's wall, And, mastered by Prince Julian's hand, Its sweet notes flowed so richly bland, They told unseen the minstrel lover, And Zulma's soaring spirit over Threw breathless rapture as she fled From her lone cell with footstep light, While Inez' heart, at every tread, Spake like deep voices of the night. VIII. Queen of the skies! why should the beams Of thy soft eye so richly glow O'er scenes that darkest gloom beseems, As fitting their soul-harrowing woe? Why should thy smile alike illume Despair and Hope, and Love and Hate, The bridal mansion and the tomb, Hearts full of bliss and desolate? Empress of Heaven! oh, thou wert made For blooming hearts and tearless eyes, To light the spirit's serenade, And high-soul'd love's fond ecstacies; And, when young Time in Eden's bowers Wore radiant crowns of fragrant flowers, While innocence with him would rove In soothing shade of fair-leaved grove, And love was bliss and truth its own Blest guerdon in the morning's sight, When angels looked from Glory's throne And threw around her robes of light; Ere woe was born of sin, and crime Blotted from man's corrupted heart The fairest name that youthful Time Had written there with magic art; Ere the sad hour man's father fell, And o'er his fall rose shouts from hell, Thou, sky-throned Isis! from above, Saw'st nought but pure unconscious love Beneath the azure sky—whose sun Smiled on each deed by mortals done. Alas! thou now art doomed to gaze Upon a world so dark and fell, That thy most pure and lovely rays Reveal man's heart a living hell! IX. On the young vestals' desperate flight Thou didst look down with smile as gay As it had been their bridal night, And they were led in fair array O'er bright saloons and marbled halls; And on St. Clara's prison walls Thy gleaming radiance shone as fair As if delight were smiling there; And on the lovely Inez' eye As she and Zulma fled in fear, Thy rays were thrown from yon blue sky, Unconscious that they lit a tear. Crossing the cypressed cemetry, They hurried on with unheard tread 'Till they had gained the boundary Of the lone empire of the Dead, When, ere the signal could be given To those who watched beyond the wall, Inez stretched forth her hands to Heaven, Weeping as if the hour when all Her hopes should die had come and spread Its pall o'er life—and thus she said;— “Now, ere we part, sweet Zulma, say “Thou lov'st me as in childhood's day, “When we together fondly strayed “Through arboured groves and green-wood shade, “Plucked roses on the mead to crown “The hours we loved to call our own. “And felt that heaven looked smiling down, “When none beneath the laughing sky “Were half so gay as thou and I. “Tell me the bloom of life's young flowers “Still lingers round thy changeless heart “And that the joy of happier hours “Will never from thy soul depart!” “Now ere we part! a strange prelude, “Fair sister! to the heart's high bliss; “Thy very spirit is imbued “With doubts and fears—away with this! “Thou art MY sister! droop not now, “Remember thine and Dion's vow! “They hear our rustling in the shade— “Here is the cord-wove escalade— “Now, Inez, fearless follow me, “Doubt not, we must and shall be free.” Unfaltering Zulma scaled the height, Cheering the lovely nun to speed, And then flew down with footstep light To Julian's arms, most blest indeed, The solitary vestal stood A moment ere she dared to climb, And in that moment's solitude Her stolen flight appeared like crime; She was so pure, so lovely, sin Tinged not a thought her soul within. But Dion hung upon the height, And step by step she climbed above, Her hand was stretched, in wild delight, To grasp that of her only love, When fancied guilt and dark despair Came o'er her as she lingered there, And her brain reeled in dizziness; She heeded not the cries below, She could not see nor hear nor know The insupportable distress Of those who saw her form on high, Delirium in her swimming eye! One last shrill shriek of wild affright. The falling form that met his sight, The hollow groan, that rose and fell Upon his heart like ruin's knell, X. “Away—away! Prince Julian, fly! “The alarum bell is pealing high, “And ruthless hordes of vestal fiends “Are rushing hither!”—Who ascends Again that dreadful wall, so late Scaled with a look that smiled at Fate? 'Tis Zulma—“Julian! leave me now, “For I must share the death I wrought, “And consummate my vestal vow “In pain and darkness as I ought.” She rose to give her purpose deed, When Dion barred her path and cried— “Prince Julian! as thou would'st in need, “And when despair hath humbled pride, “Crave mercy of the Power on high, “Seize Zulma quick, and fly, fly, fly!” In passion wild and wildered fear The Prince obeyed the wise behest, And grasped the heroic maiden ere Her deed had left him thrice unblest, And, ere a moment more had flown, The high-soul'd nun and Prince had gone. Count Dion watched till they had fled, Then sprung below among the dead, Where headstones gleamed to mock the gloom, The desolation of the tomb. Gently he raised the unconscious nun, And laid her bleeding on his breast, Thus—even thus, a blessed one To pillow such a form to rest; While, as he gazed in speechless woe On her soft, lovely features graven With death's dark lines, he saw below Nor love nor joy, nor hope in heaven. But scarce the space of lightning's glare Was left to muse of his despair, Or soothe the suffering Inez there, The cloister horde by Clotilde led, Exulting that their holy hate Could now be poured on beauty's head And virtue's bosom desolate, Rushed like hyena troops upon The gallant Dion—but, appalled By his proud port, though all alone He stood—they paused and shrilly called The faggot priest, their alguazil, To guard the holy cloister's weal. Folding his bosom's dying bride With one strong arm unto his breast, And with the other waving wide Iberia's sword that many a crest Had cloven in the deadly fray, He bade the throng yield ample way, And sprung upon the ladder's height; Then came the alguazil, the light Of hell was in his scowling eye, Dashing the trembling host aside Like war-ship rushing in its pride. The lover there that moment stood, Not like a warrior trained in blood, But like that Spirit who on high His four-edged sword flashed o'er the sky, And bade the sinning mortal die. “Yield thee, blasphemer! Heaven commands.” “Chain, then, the bold blasphemer's hands, “And bind his madden'd spirit down “Low as thy master's and thine own.” “Darest thou the monarch's alguazil?” “Bid ye the whelp-robbed lion kneel!” “Dark ruffian! thou wilt rue this hour.” “Ruffian!—not while my sword hath power.” And with the word the unfailing blade Low at his feet the opposer laid, And Dion seized the escalade. He springs with more than mortal might, He rises—almost gains the height— His hand is on the moss-grown wall— This moment saves or ruins all! A word, a thought, a look, a dream May ratify the doom of years; One glance, one quick electric gleam May lead unto an age of fears! Oh! Dion, nerve thy heart again, One minute—spring—and thou art free, O think—thy love—'tis vain—'tis vain, Despair hath sealed thy destiny! They tear away the cord-wove frame, And thou art doomed to woe and shame! Still Dion bears the double weight With one torn, bleeding, numbing hand Awhile—he falls—the scroll of Fate Hath rolled its darkest record! “Stand, “Exulting demons, stand ye there, “And o'er all earth your triumph yell, “And laugh o'er death and life's despair, “For than ye worse reign not in hell!” XI. 'Tis joy to gaze, from the tall ships lee, On the curling waves of the moonlight sea, When the mellow airs of spring-time night Come over the heart as it floats in light, And the sleeping flowers exhale perfume, Like a virgin's breath from lips of bloom, And the dark-blue waters curl and gleam In the diamond star-light's mirrored beam, While the spirit burns o'er the glittering sea 'Till it longs a moonlight wave to be. Oh, spirits that sail on the moonlight sea Should have thoughts as vast as eternity, And feelings as pure as the sleeping rose, When its leaves in the dew of the sunset close. XII. O'er Lusitania's soft-blue moonlight bay Swells the gay song of reckless gondolier, While his bark dances, as the waters play, On the shore waves that glitter bright and clear. Dim in the distance, marked upon the sky, Wave the blue pennon and the glimmering sail, And oft is heard the master's anxious cry While shoreward sea-boy answers to his hail. Yet, save his song and their expectant cries, The world is slumbering in a soft repose, And spirits from their star-thrones in the skies Breathe softly as a dew-lipped sleeping rose. It is the hour when love's communion fills Eye, lip and heart with rapture's magic light; When waning Dian, throned on shadowy hills, Smiles o'er young transports from her azure height. Pomegranate, orange, lime and citron groves Shadow gray turrets and time-honoured towers, And heaven's pale queen amid their arbours roves, And counts with tears the melancholy hours. But hushed is song of happy gondolier, And fast the shadowy sail ascends on high;— A step, a form, a voice—“Prince Julian's here!” “Alfonso, haste! this hour we 'scape or die!” XIII. Before the rising, shrill-voiced gale Flies the yard-stretching, mighty sail, Swelling o'er broad Atlantic billow, Like swan upon her wavy pillow, Dashing aside from her high prow The wave, whose hissing foam-wreaths glow Like jewels thrown in floating snow, And hurrying on her watery way, Between two oceans, heaven and earth's, Like war-horse through the battle fray, Whose mighty heart would burst his girths In its high swelling, should his lord Or check his speed or sheathe his sword. With a long sigh, as if from dream Of pain and anguish slowly waking, From Julian's breast, with sudden scream Wild as her bleeding heart were breaking, Zulma rose and gazed around On ocean's sons, on wave and sky, And then fell back and deeply groaned, While gleamed through tears her eagle eye. “Inez! sweet Inez!” Shudderings came Over her like the sansar's breath, As from her heart flowed that sweet name Which now was linked with woe and death, And, wrapt in silent suffering, She saw nor wave nor sky nor lover, Nor heard the light-winged breezes sing, Like nymphs in sea-shells, ocean over; All—all to her was pain and gloom, Her thoughts of what she left behind And o'er her angel sister's tomb She heard the lonely wailing wind, With spirit voice of wild distress, Denouncing Inez' murderess! Darkly with phantoms of her brain Communing, o'er the billowy main Zulma was hurried rapidly, And the low murmuring of the sea Seemed, when she heard the gulfing surge Hymning the murdered vestal's dirge. XIV. The virgin huntress of the skies With Ocean's daughters flies afar, And Eos and her nymphs arise Above the sun-god's throne, each star, Orion's blazing sword of light, And the twin-martyrs' glory bright, And sea-born Beauty's radiance dimming, While blue-zoned Tethys weaves a crown Of pearls and corals brightly swimming Through her vast empire fathoms down, To deck Aurora's rosy brow As her white steeds o'er ether fly, And proud Hyperion, bright and slow, Rolls unto heaven his glorious eye. The bird of Jove his mighty wings Waves o'er the crimson vault above, And from his eye a radiance flings Bright as the brightest glance of love. The white-plumed sea-gull skims the sea, The curlew sports around the bark, And nature sings of liberty And love as when from ancient ark The beasts of earth and birds of heaven To their bright fields and skies were given. XV. The rushing ship is sailing now O'er the bright wave of Trafalgar, And morn is blushing o'er the brow Of Algarve's dusky mountains far, With the same smile of living bloom As when to ocean's billowy tomb, Amid the sea-fray's carnage red, Their requiem shouts of victory, Shrouded in glory, England's Dead Sunk with unclosed, war-lightened eye, Whose last, bright glance from gory wave Saw England's banner proudly streaming Victorious o'er their ocean grave, And England's sword triumphal gleaming; And o'er his sons, with every surge, Bright, billowy ocean sings their dirge. And now the swelling sail is fanned By zephyrs o'er that narrow sea, O'er which on either margin stand Those giant mountain twins which he, Alcmena's son, with god-like power, Severed and poured the sea between, And which, since that rock-sundering hour, The deadliest foes have ever been. Thence onward holds the bark her way Through the blue wave in fair array, While to the northern view arise The Appenines 'neath bending skies, O'er whose snow-mantled summits erst The Mauritanian hero led His warlike host, by fate accursed, To glory, as the warrior said, And the proud spoils of mighty Rome; In that soul-stirring hour of pride, When his heart rolled in glory's tide, Having dread Cannæ in his view No more than he whom Waterloo Doom'd to the Rock-Isle's living tomb, Had of that desolating fray On Lodi's or Marengo's day. Before the view, where sun-beams smile, Rises that rocky mountain isle, Where he was born, the mighty one, Whose gory course of fame is run; And where, perchance, a guiltless boy, His fellows' chief, his mother's joy, He wandered oft, and played, and smiled Amid the mountain's shrubbery wild, An innocent and happy child; Undreaming of his pomp and power. His crimes, disgrace and exile fate. Ah! few can tell in childhood's hour What thoughts and deeds their manhood wait Or who will bann or bless the name That blazes on the scroll of Fame. In him a mighty spirit burned, But with a fierce volcano glare, Oh, had that soaring spirit turned To heaven and drank in glory there, Earth would have bowed in rapture's mood And held his name in sanctitude. The Man, who guides a nation's way To bloodless glory, o'er his name Throws fairer wreaths of light than they Who deck Earth's highest shrine of Fame. But ah! he fell, and with him died His empire, power, and pomp, and pride; And nought remains of all he won— Quenched is Napoleon's zenith sun. Still onward fleet the ship careers, Like rapid lapse of hurrying years, While fades the bright foam of its wake, Like all the joys we give or take, And bears, with sail expanding high, Its course, beneath a glorious sky, Toward soft Campania's fairy land, Where zephyrs sport with breathings bland O'er ruins erst of pride and fame, And gorgeous domes of deathless shame. And, 'mid the night that robes the skies, Julian directs sad Zulma's view Where Ætna's fiery columns rise In desolation's lurid hue, Glaring between this world and heaven, Like fiends to whom destruction's given. The baleful light is flaring o'er Trinacria's vine-clad, flowery shore, Where Arethusa once gush'd forth In lucid streams for bards to drink, And Alpheus 'neath the sea and earth Met his fair fountain bride—the brink Bloomed like a garden of sweet flowers, And, near, Ortygia's sacred grove Delayed the rosy-footed hours Of pure delight and raptured Love. A weedy marsh now stagnates there, And taints the thick and sluggish air, As all man's hopes close in despair. The lovers' course is almost done, The lovers' goal is nearly won, And how hath Zulma borne the flight? Like one whose brighest day was night. Like one whose heart hath caught a taint Of crime, though fancied, dark and deep; Whose dread remorse doth ever paint Horrors, and ne'er is lulled to sleep, Since o'er a spirit proud and high It reigns with three-fold energy. Who backward looks and finds despair, And forward, misery bars her there; Who hath no hope on earth and none Beneath high heaven's offended throne. The more she thinks, the darker grows The volume of her sins and woes; No change comes o'er her agony; Like Ætna's fire, it burns within, And, dark'ning o'er the spirit's sky, Burns ever with the gathering sin. It was not madness; o'er her brain Coherent thoughts ceased not to flow; But 'twas that dread, oppressive pain, That mountain weight of crushing woe, Which follows, in a sinless mind, A deed that spirits too refined Brood into guilt—for priestcraft e'er Riots in human woe and fear. Reason was worse than vain, and speech The dreadful mania could not reach, That o'er her burning spirit shed The baneful death-dew of despair, The upas of a bosom dead To all of beautiful and fair; For Zulma sought no sympathy, No comfort faithless as 'tis free, But leaned upon the penal rod And bowed her burning heart to God. XVI. The barque has passed the Tyrrhine sea And anchored in the glorious bay Of proud and base Parthenope, Neapolis, or Naples. Where perfumed gales with sunlight play O'er antique temple, giant tower, And palace proud, whose mirrored dome, Like a bright heaven, o'er many a tomb Of many a mighty one laid low Gleams with a rich, refulgent glow, Like Freedom o'er lost Power. The barque is moored—the lovers gone Beyond the once fair Lucrine lake, Where dark-browed Ruin reigns alone O'er Baiæ lost in marshy brake, And all the fairy gardens, groves, Meadows and dales erst loved so well By him Lucullus (so reckless luxury proves In one a nation's ruin fell) Who shunning Glory's shrine when he Had gained the fane, left mighty Rome The victim of fierce anarchy, Dreading yet hurrying on her doom. Lucrine—the haunt of mirth is gone, And there volcanoes glare alone! Baiæ hath sunk to dust, and she, Earth's mistress stands, like ancestry, Scowling o'er sons whose highest boast Had been their fathers' deepest shame, To pride, to truth, to glory lost, To honest hearts and patriot fame. XVII. Days, weeks and months have been and gone, And lovely Zulma dwells alone In solitary castle high Between fair earth and fairer sky. Julian had been, all lovers are, Had knelt and sworn his deathless love, And, like a sky-throned, radiant star, Thrown light and beauty from above; He had been all that being is, Whom kindoms wait—I dare not dwell On man's intent to offer bliss To one who had for him farewell Bidden all thoughts of earth and heaven, And sole to him her full heart given. Prince Julian was Campania's heir, And thus decreed his royal sire;— “Thou wed'st proud Austria's daughter fair, “Or never com'st the sceptre nigher.” Julian was proud of pomp and fame— The fair nun could nor trump his name Nor plume his power—but she might be The unseen queen of sovereignty, The empress of his private hours— The angel of his palace bowers. So Julian thought, though he had tried Her honest fame by speech oblique And look lascivious, when his pride And birth and state appeared most weak Before wronged Zulma's Juno eye, Whose glance spake pride and purity. From day to day he talked of love, While Zulma would not see his aim, Save when the princely sophist strove To prove all rites a needless name; Then flashed her eye and glowed her brow, Like sunbeams o'er the mountain snow. On love I will not moralize; It hath more wiles and snares than sighs; Sooth be the tale and fair I tell— His deeds are man's true chronicle. XVIII. 'Twas soft Campania's evening hour, And earth and heaven were seas of light, And Zulma in her rose-wove bower Sate gazing on the horizon bright, Where white clouds float and turn to gold In many a bright and glorious fold, And fancy pictures angel pinions Far waving o'er those high dominions, 'Till, as she thought of pleasures gone, And Inez, tortured, dying, dead, And her own misery there alone, Her hopes destroyed, her true loves fled, Her bleeding heart left desolate, And all the ills and woes of fate, She seized her harp and mournfully Sung of those joys no more to be. THE BANKS OF ZEVERE. The bright sun is sinking o'er Italy's sea, And kissing Campania's fair gardens of flowers, But, oh, his smile brings no pleasure to me, For my heart ever grieveth o'er childhood's sweet hours: Sweetly gay rise the notes of the lover's guitar, As he greets his heart's bride in the valley cot near, But, ah, all my songs of delight are afar, Like a spirit's voice heard on the banks of Zevere. How oft have I sat with sweet Inez upon Those rose-cushioned banks in our being's gay hours, And fancied delights ever new to be won In the great World of beauty and music and flowers! How oft, O thou dear one! I slumbered with thee In our moon-lighted bower in the spring of the year And heard the birds singing on our apricot-tree When we woke to delight on the banks of Zevere! How often when nature in vain bloomed around I turned in my heart-stricken sorrow to thee, And in vigil and penance and weariness found Thy sweet love a solace and treasure to me! But, alas! thou art dead, and I am alone, Far from all that on earth or in heaven were dear; Fare thee well, lovely Inez! dark shadows are thrown O'er our bower on the banks of the lonely Zevere. Julian had stood beside the bower, And heard, unseen, the mournful song, While every blushing, dewy flower Reproached him with fair Zulma's wrong; But nature's voice, so soft, so still, Fails to o'errule ambition's pride, Or with atoning sorrow fill A lordly heart unsanctified. Julian drew near and greeted fair The sad, forsaken, lovely maid, And, eloquent in praise and prayer, Rehearsing all he oft had said, Implored compliance with his love, Acceptance of his treasures—all— And she should ever—ever prove The queen of banquet, bower and hall, And be his heart's eternal bride, His life his sun, his hope, his heaven, And, when he gained his throne of pride, His royal name should soon be given. But, while the Prince besought and prayed, How sat and looked the insulted maid? Like her of Enna's rosy vale When wooed by him of Acheron; Her marble brow, her cheek so pale, Her tearful eye—all brightly shone With pride and shame, disdain and scorn, And thus—“Why was I ever born “So to be scoffed at?” quick began The nun, while fierce her hot blood ran, And her small form, dilating, grew Like towering angel on the view. “Prince Julian, cease! I charge thee, cease! “Are these thy notes of love and peace? “Art thou to be a nation's king? “Thou—false, deluding, faithless thing! “The thoughts that lightened spirits high “In the old days of chivalry, “Throw not a wandering gleam o'er thee, “Thou craven night of loselry! “Vemeira is a noble name, “And it can never be that fame “Should Zulma's memory link with shame. “Shall I thy leman be? O no! “?Never while I can wield a blow, “While poison drops or waters flow. “Rede thou a woman's spirit well “Ere mock her thus with words from hell, “And know that virtue is her heaven, “To things like thee, oh, never given! “O Julian, Julian! love like mine “Is quenchless, deathless, for 'tis pure; “E'en now it doth around thee twine “Fondly, and cannot but endure “The same as when thine eye first shone “O'er the same mirror as my own. “Hadst thou been what I thought thee erst “As knightly as thou wert at first, “Though doomed to groan in poverty, “'Mid malice, misery, wrong and ill, “The slave of fear—a lord to me— “I would have loved—obeyed thee still, “And, with unsorrowing brow and eye, “Forsaken not and unforsaking, “When sleeping, kissed thy misery “Away, and sung to thee when waking. “But these are dreams of passion yet “Surviving when its hope hath set; “Vain mockeries of my bosom's sun, “Quenched ere his journey hath begun! “I leave thee, Julian! and be thou “Thy own just judge—no worse! and now— “There are thy gifts!”—From neck of snow Her carcanet—and then her zone Of jewels and her chains and rings She loosed and threw, disdainful, down; “There, Julian, take the gilded things, “For which thou thought'st that I would sell “My honour—and now fare thee well!” XIX. Bewildered, lost in guilt and shame, And torrent passions wildly warring; Defied, despised in deed and name, Each wild-fire thought another marring; Prince Julian stood unmoving where, In all the grandeur of despair, Zulma, like empress throned in power More than deserted nun, had left Her lover in that sundering hour When her proud heart of hope was reft. Zulma had hurried from his view— Her form of love, her voice, her smile, No more enchantment o'er him threw— No more his sorrows could beguile; She had been his—and now was not— He had been hers in grief and woe— Now she had gone—to be forgot— And he was left alone to—“No! “By Heaven! it cannot, shall not be! “Crown, sceptre, kingdom—what are ye “To love and love's true paradise? The earth preferred unto the skies! “Ambrose!” “My lord!”—“Caparison “The fleetest steed in all my stalls, “And bring the courser here anon— “And guard thou well the castle walls! “I will the maid regain or die, “For Honour is man's majesty!” He vaulted on his gallant steed, And vanished in the forest dun, Then rose the hill, and o'er the mead Rushed 'neath the last beam of the sun. CANTO II. I. O land of my birth! thou fair world of the West! With freedom and glory and happiness blest! Thou nation upspringing from forest and grove, Like wisdom's armed queen from the brain of high Jove! Though thy winds are the coldest the North ever blows, And thy mountains the drearest when covered with snows; Tho' the warm fount of feeling is chilled while it gushes, And pleasure's stream frozen as brightly it rushes; Tho' thy sons, like their clime, are oft chilling and rude And rough as the oak in their own mountain wood; Yet I love thee, my country! as fondly as Tell Loved the Alpine Republic he rescued so well. For thy yeomen can circle the winter-eve hearth, Undreading oppression, and talk of the Earth, Whose bosom yields nurture to father and son Leaving hearts pure and gay when the glad work is done: While the pæans they shout over glories by-gone Are echoed by virtues for ever their own. O thou home of the rover o'er ocean's rude wave, Asylum of sorrow and fort of the brave! Advance in thy glory o'er forest and sea, Unrivalled, unconquered, heroic and free! Though the rose bloom and fade in its holiday hour, And the sun-god is palled in his glory of power Tho' winter's cold breath blanch the blossoming rose, Unlike the bright clime where the sky ever glows, Yet thy virtues bend not to each soothing breeze, Whose syren song lures through the soft shading trees Like the gay, grovelling sons of the tropical clime, Whose skies are all glory—whose earth is all crime. None love thee so well as thy sons far away, None bless thee more oft than the bard of this lay. II. The sunniest rose that ever blowed In velvet vale of soft Cashmere; The loveliest light that ever glowed O'er heaven in spring-time of the year, Ne'er blushed and beamed more purely bright Than gentle Inez' sinless heart Upon that dread unholy night When doomed with all it loved to part. No spirit, gazing from above, With eyes impearled in pity's tears, Cherished more heavenly thoughts of love In glory's highest, brightest spheres. Than that pure child of love and light, Dragged, 'neath the covert of the night, To the dim arch'd refectory; Where, telling fast their rosaries, And lifting many a saint-like eye To heaven with muttered groans and sighs, The demon conclave met to doom To living grave, to breathing tomb, The apostate, suffering, dying nun. The word hath passed—the deed is done! Ere morn gleams through the pictured glass Of prison cell, or o'er the wall Of dark St. Clara light doth pass, Dimly and thick and sickening, all Of that dark bigot band, save one, Are kneeling at the tapered shrine, Before the Omniscient's holy throne, Where every thought should be divine, To chant their impious prayers to Him, In whose creation-searching eye Not even the heavenliest seraphim Are pure in their great piety! Alas! that Heaven's most blessed boon, Religion, breathing peace and love, In man's polluted heart so soon The veriest creed of hell should prove! III. Unseen, unfelt, unknown, her fate O'er the fair vestal's head had past, And she was left all desolate— The doom was sealed—the die was cast— Ere, waking from her dreadful dream, She faintly said—“I heard a scream “Of death, methought, O Dion! say “Is Zulma safe?” Then, as she lay Leaning against the dungeon wall, She turned—groaned—and fell back again; “Oh, Dion! love! oh, tell me all, “Where—where is Zulma?”—Awful pain Came o'er her then and dimmed the eye Of yesternight's dread memory, And through her spirit's drear opaque She could not look—she could not take Perception of her agony; She knew 'twas so—but how or why It baffled her delirious brain To tell;—and then she thought again, And more distinct her memory grew Of what had passed—and chill the dew Of death hung on her writhen brow, Where love still shed its parting glow, As dim she caught the past and gone; Yet she could not—the dying one, Think why she thus was left alone. She spake again, but faint and low— “O Dion! thou hast often said “Thy love could master every woe, “And o'er all griefs its radiance shed; “It cannot be that thou should'st now “Forsake thy love, forget thy vow— “Now, when I feel—O Dion, come “And bear me hence—I must go home!” She listened then for some faint sound, And strove to rise and look around; But all was midnight gloom, and she Alone there in her agony. Still memory gathered link by link— And still life's current quickly bled— With a death-thirst she longed to drink What flowed around her dungeon bed; She scooped the fluid in her hand, And bore it to her lips—'t was blood! And then her spirit lost command 'Mid horror, gloom, and solitude, While thought, no words of man can tell, O'er all the past began to swell, And well she saw her hopeless doom, There buried in eternal gloom, Whence shrillest shriek and wildest cry Could never reach the shuddering sky. No missal there nor cross had she, O'er which to breathe her parting breath; To cheer her in her misery, And change to bliss the pangs of death; For they had banned the dying nun And barred redeeming penitence! Demons! their hate her glory won— Her amulet was innocence! So malice works its own reward, And weakest proves when most on guard, For never yet hath hatred wrought The deadly ruin which it sought, Untended by a deadlier blow Than that which laid its victim low. IV. A sound disturbed her solitude— High chanting from the chapelry; Like wailings from a gloomy wood When echoed by a stormy sky, The distant swell of cloister strain And matin hymn came o'er her brain, And roused to life her slumbering pain; It was her dirge—that morning song, And slowly rolled the notes along The cypress groves—the vaults—the cells— Like murder's midnight groan which tells The fearful deed most fearfully; And there the lovely Inez lay In suffering's last extremity, While not a solitary ray Of light relieved the heart-felt gloom That palled her spirit in the tomb. It was a mockery of her woe— The mass of hell yelled out below— That pæan, like a death-doom sent Through farthest vault—through deepest cell, To agonize the punishment Of the fair one Heaven loved so well. But oh, no fiend with things can cope Whom God hath left to their own will— Giv'n o'er beyond all reach of hope, At hate's hell-cup to drink their fill; The deadliest demon, banned the most, May fill the archangel's holiest throne Ere mortal once—forever lost, Can for his damning deeds atone. The light of heaven may beam o'er hell Dimly and touch the apostate there; But man, abandoned, bids farewell To hope, and weds his own despair. V. Another sound the stillness broke, And Inez' bleeding heart awoke. It was the wailing of a dove, The death-song of a simple bird O'er her who died for heaven and love, And gladly were the soft notes heard. Perched on a cypress o'er her cell, The bird hailed not the glorious sun, But sadly sung the last farewell Of the pure, sweet, expiring nun, To earth and earthly sins and woes And life so early in its close. As Inez listened to the strain, And longed to waft it back again, The shade of death was in her eye, The pulses of her being beat Faintly, and death's last agony Came o'er her like a shadowy bloom, A soft voice stealing from the tomb, A light to guide the parting spirit Beyond the woes that all inherit. Feebly she sunk—the crimson tide Gushed forth no more—her heart was still; Yet her lips trembled as she died— “Dion—forgive—my wrongs!” and 'till Her features sunk collapsed in death That name was breathed with every breath. VI. A taper gleams amid the gloom— A white-robed form approaches near— It pauses by the dungeon tomb, And listens tensely as in fear, Or hope—and now it moves again And lifts the iron-bolted grate, And gazes o'er the cell of pain, Doubting its lovely tenant's fate. Demon! go in—thy victim's gone! Unseen, unheard, like guilt alone, Clotilde doth listen there awhile, And then descends—and with a smile Deadly and dark moves round the corse, Whose features are an angel's still. “Dead?—Ay, 'tis well—it had been worse “Had justice half fulfilled my will “Or hadst thou lived till now!”—She turned The lovely vestal's body o'er, And laughed aloud; and then she spurned The corse upon its gory floor, And smiled as if she gave it pain; And then she raised the beauteous nun— “Ay, 'tis a blessed fate, sweet one! “That thou hast wrought thyself—again “Thou would'st not do the deed!” She threw The pale, cold corse in scorn away, And yet more dark her features grew, As death had robbed her of her prey; And still she stood, with fiend-like eye, Revelling in hatred's demon feast, And with low curse and muttered cry Banning e'en Him who had released The vestal from her deadly power And raised the soul to Eden's bower, When a loud crash rose high—and far The echo as of bolt and bar Shooting, went forth!—Where art thou now, Proud abbess? Ah! thou soon wilt know! The iron portal to the cell, The lifted grate had fallen—how It nought avails for me to tell; Perchance, the wind had laid it low, Or death-winged angel might have thrown The dreadful bars in anger down, Eternal justice to dispense To suffering, murdered innocence. Howe'er it was—proud Clotilde there Was doomed to perish with the dead, In silence, darkness and despair, And meet the fate her sentence said. There could be no relief—no, none— She had gone forth, unseen, alone, And from that subterranean cell No cry arose to human ear; It was a dark monastic hell, Beyond hope's sun-illumined sphere. She shook the bars—but they were fast— She shrieked—but echo mocked her pain; She gazed around—but shadows past Like fiends, and she sunk down again. And then remorse was leagued with fear. And both like vipers gnawed her heart: And horrid sounds were in her ear That cried—“What dost thou here? depart! “Seek thou the hell of thy dark creed, “Thine be the doom thou hast assigned, “The unpitying bigot's bitter meed, “The quenchless ruins of the mind! “Depart! depart!” how awful e'er Is guilt when phrenzied by its fear! VII. Unshrived, she there must die in all Her unforgiven guilt and woe; On either side a dungeon wall, And wrath above and death below Unsoothed, unpitied and alone, Without a single orison, Without a tear to mourn her fate, Or look of grief compassionate, Or holy right or orris pall Or requiem chanted forth by all The holy vestal sisterhood, Who round her erst admiring stood As if St. Marie had been given To them in other form from heaven. But such be guilt's dark fate for e'er! She there must perish dust to dust, Unshriven in the dungeon drear, Accursed below—among the just All entrance barred eternally! Now guilt forestalled redemption's hours, And madness sprung from agony! Darkly the storm of misery lowers, And darker yet it soon shall be; For Sin uprears her giant form And mad Remorse, her spectre, stands, Gashed by the fangs of guilt's dark worm, Lifting on high his gory hands To warn too late—to tell at last The victim that her day hath past, And yet more awful thoughts arise More fearful shadows blast her view, And wilder are her echoed cries, And colder is the dungeon-dew. VIII. Time flies—strength fails—but madness grows Stronger and darker in its mood, And fevered Fear delirious throws, O'er all the gloom a robe of blood; And now she sinks beside the nun, There like a song-lulled angel sleeping, And smiling as her woes were done, And she in heaven were vigils keeping. She starts as if an adder stung! A demon voice of mirth had rung Through all the chambers of her brain; She listens—now it comes again, Blended with laughter wild and rude, And echoes through the fatal cell, And cries aloud—“Thy soul's imbued “With blood of innocence;—'tis well “That on thy victim's lifeless breast “Thou should'st sink in eternal rest!” Her maniac heart could bear no more, The last extremity had come; She grovelled on the cold earth floor In speechless anguish at her doom; Gazed with a madden'd eye, that told What horrors o'er her bosom rolled, Upon the nun who slept as still As infant that has drank its fill; Then with a shriek that might appal The fiend, against the dungeon wall Dashed headlong—groaned and died!—'Tis past, The more than mortal suffering. Alas! I would it were the last! But earthly minstrel dare not sing Of fates beyond the farthest ken Of starry-eyed philosophy; Among the abodes of mortal men He finds enough of misery To break the heart and rack the brain That feels or thinks of human pain. Her fate hath past—her soul hath fled— And peace attend the voiceless Dead! IX. Life scarce had parted and her fate Passed o'er the haughty abbess there, Ere steps approached the iron grate, And voices, as in last despair, Echoed above the fatal cell.— The portal's raised and they descend, The sisterhood.—Now note ye well, Fair vestals! ere ye ween to wend In sin's broad path, sin's woful end! The highest bliss of heaven may prove The bitterest dreg in misery's cup, And spirits born of heaven and love By guilt be lost and given up To state abhorring and abhorred— And not adoring and adored! Long was the anxious search and quest Ere they could trace their abbess there, And anguish searched full many a breast As they stood gazing in despair On murdered and on murderess. I pause not now to paint the scene— The natural ills of life suffice To fill with tears the sternest eyes, When thought retraces what hath been, To gloom the heart and cloud the way That shone so brightly yesterday. Together from the dungeon cell The corses were in silence borne, While lingering tolled the funeral knell, And sullen echoes moaned forlorn; And shrouded in their vestments white, They laid them side by side, and kept Their vigils through the livelong night, While breathlessly the dead ones slept, As softly as two infants, born Perchance, to be each other's scorn! The wakeful sisters watched alone, And many a holy rite was done To foil the fiend and save the soul Of her who once held high control O'er penance stern and vow austere, For many a long and sinful year. The lovely innocent that there Too holy was for grief or prayer, Lay like a picture of the blest,— 'Twas her last hour and loveliest! They watched—they prayed—night waned and morn, Like holy hope in Eden born, Blushed the stained glass and casement through, And gave the gloomy scene to view. X. To die—to feel the spirit fainting In the mansions of the breast, While yet the vivid eye is painting Life and vigor unpossessed; To see the mortal frame decaying, The temple's pillars breaking down, And know the soul will soon be straying Over climes and realms unknown; While warm affection hovers o'er The couch of death, with wailing prayer Imploring lengthened life once more In all the anguish of despair; And we behold and feel and know All that is felt for us and yet Beside perceive the overthrow Of hopes on which the heart is set, And picture in our dying hour Anguish unknown till we are dead, And conscious, hopeless misery's power, And tears from being's fountains shed— Oh, 'tis a time, an hour of gloom Worse than the midnight of the tomb! But, ah, 'tis worse to think that we, The proud, high, sentient lords of earth Must moulder into dust and be Or clay or nothing! At our birth It was decreed that we should die, But not that we should rotting lie With every foul and loathsome thing Blending our ashes.—Fling, oh, fling My corse in ocean's booming wave, Or burn it on the funeral pyre, But lay it not in reeking grave To glimmer with corruption's fire! St. Clara's funeral bell is knelling With the solemn voice of death, And far the mournful notes are swelling While from postern far beneath Issue the white-robed virgin train, Chanting low the requiem strain, Over the dark and dismal tomb Of one in being's roseate bloom, And one in sallow withered age, Departed from life's tragic stage. Where sorrow never wakes to weep, And ill and wrong distract no more, And homeless wanderers sweetly sleep, And hate and pride and pain are o'er, They lay the vestals finally. Above them waves a cypress tree, Intwined with briar and rosemary, And round them sleep the mighty dead, Who centuries since forever fled; A silent nation gone—alas! Where living thought can never pass. The ceremonial pomp is past— The vestals vanish, one by one— The holy father is the last, And even he hath slowly gone. And stillness reigns o'er all the scene, That is so peaceful and serene; A stillness greatly eloquent When pious spirits bow and feel Delicious melancholy, sent From heaven o'er all their being steal With purifying breathings mild; And they become like little child Gentle and docile, purely good, In their communing solitude, And look from earth to heaven with eye Of sage reflecting piety, Comparing man's allotment here With glories of a brighter sphere. XI. O Love! the holiest name in heaven, The purest, sweetest thing below! Why are thy joys to torture given? Thy rapture's unto wailing woe? Why should thy fondest votaries prove Faithful even unto death in vain? Or why, despite thy vows, O Love! Should all thy blisses close in pain? No voice was heard—no form was seen Within the churchyard's lonely bound, And Dion, from his weedy screen, Rose mournfully and gazed around. Long had he watched each lone—lone hour For some faint note of joy or grief, 'Till destiny's most dreaded power To him had almost been relief. But nought allayed his dread suspense 'Till Inez and her murderess Were borne to that lone mansion whence No tenant ever found egress. Then flashed the whole revealment dire O'er Dion's burning heart and brain, And death became a wild desire, A refuge from his penal pain. With rolling eye, and brow of gloom, And pallid cheek and trembling tread, Dion approached the robbing tomb Where Inez slept among the dead, And bowed his throbbing head upon The dark funereal tablet stone Despairingly, while forth his tears Unbidden gushed.—“In youthful years “I little recked of fate like this; “I thought the world was full of bliss “And man most blessed in life—Alas! “I am not now the thing I was; “And nought remains for me to dare “But misery, madness and despair; “The darkness of a breast that bleeds “O'er the wild thought of damning deeds, “The doom that never will depart “From the dim mansions of the heart.” He drew his poniard, looked on high For the last time with gleaming eye, Then laid him down the grave beside And clove his heart! The purple tide Gushed like a torrent and—he died! The last glance of his spirit turning To her for whom his heart was burning XII. The autumnal sun's rich evening beams Blush o'er Cantabria's billowy sea, And Lusian fields and groves and streams, Like angel smiles, celestially; And clustering vines hang purpling o'er The shrubbery-mantled palisade, And golden orange, cypress hoar, And cork-tree rough, and yew, whose shade The dead alone doth canopy, And sunken glen and dim defile, Alike in nature's bounties free, Return the soul-inspiring smile Of Autumn—queen-muse of the heart! And as soft evening's hues depart, Like holy hopes that smile in death, And twilight robes the fading sky With beauty felt, not seen—beneath The spreading palm, the lover's eye Burns as he tunes his soft guitar, And sees his own dear maid afar, Approaching her rose-woven bower To solemnize love's sacred hour. And lordly prince and shepherd hind, And lady proud and simple maid Enjoy alike the season kind, When flowers grow lovelier as they fade. Eve shadows dim the varied scene, And the calm sunlight wanes away, While one lone cloud of lustre sheen Still wears the rays of parting day, And hangs upon the zenith sky, Like hope the sad heart lingering by. XIII. Looming in shadowy twilight o'er Tajo's broad bay afar is seen, Scudding toward the Lusian shore, A quick, unladen brigantine; And now it grows upon the eye, White sail, dark hulk, and swan-like prow; And swells upon the evening sky Like castle turreted with snow; And full the rushing wake is heard, Blent with command's shrill-uttered word, And many a heart throbs fondly now To meet its loves and find its home, As the light vessel crinckles slow The waters which no longer foam. The brigantine is moored—the crew Are busy, boisterous, glad and gay, And jovial crowds are there;—but who Through the dense throng makes rapid way With looks so proudly desolate? Tis Zulma, who hath borne her fate And yet will bear 'till being's close, All she hath lost and still can lose, With an unshrinking spirit none Can tame or crush;—she is alone In desolation—but she bears Her lofty brow unblanched, and throws Around an eye undimned by tears, And, as she hurries on, she grows Stronger, as if her spirit stood Prepared for woe of all degree, And agony and solitude, And horror, and deep misery. With hurried step though tearless eye, She came, where still the massy towers Of her own convent rose before her And cast time's deepened shadows o'er her. From many a tongue too soon she heard The fatal story of the past, Told too with many a needless word, That fell like Lybia's desert blast. Zulma shrieked not, but fiercely rolled O'er brain and heart the worst—the last Wild storm of ruin; hope fell dead, And her high spirit 'neath its own Intensity was crushed; she said Nothing responsive—sigh nor groan, Nor scream nor cry was heard; she threw Her bleeding eye to heaven and bowed A moment as in prayer—then grew Like desperation calm.—A crowd, As toward St. Clara's towers she went, Followed in mute astonishment That she should thus defy despair And her own certain ruin dare. Soon ceased their marvel—Zulma came Beneath the window of her cell, And upward gazed—and sighed the name, The memory of the victim nun The loved, the lost, the lonely one, Who shed o'er life the only spell The true heart loves and prizes well. And as she gazed with mournful eye On dusky wall and cypress grove, The soul whose pride could never die, The spirit of immortal love That never sheds a human tear, Was journeying to a holier sphere. XIV. “Jesu Maria! who art thou? “Christ and the Virgin shield us now!” A war-steed dashes through the throng— A horseman leaps upon the ground, And rushes like a maniac strong Toward dying Zulma, while around Gather the crowd to mark the scene— For one so mournful ne'er had been. Zulma looked up—a faint smile passed, Like silvery moon-beam on the wave, O'er lip and eye and then it cast Behind the death hue of the grave. Low bowed the horseman, Julian, there, And fearful was his agony; He kneeled, like statue of despair, In hopeless, speechless misery; But quivering lips and burning brow Were worse than vain and idle now. “Zulma”—he said at last, but wild Came then the memory of his shame, And Zulma's eye so proudly smiled He trembled but to speak her name, For she was calm as all must be Who triumph o'er the demon—man, And hold their pride and purity Above corruption's blight and bann. But life was ebbing fast away From Zulma's broken heart and now, While yet was left a conscious ray Or never more his words must flow. He spake at last—his words were few But full of dark remorseful power, The out-pourings of the soul's mildew, That taints each lovely blooming flower, Making all life a waste!—The fire Of being, that had sunk and waned In Zulma's bosom, burned again Brightly a moment and there reigned A majesty 'mid all her pain That daunted Julian, as she strove To rise upon a maiden's breast;— “Prince Julian! that thou had'st my love, ‘And that in thine I was most blest, 'Tis bootless now to own; my doom “Is sealed forever and the tomb “Must be the resting-place of one “Who once—who yet loves thee alone; “Thou hast my pardon while I live— “Forgive thyself as I forgive!” Backward she fell—faint grew her breath, Life left her cheek, her brow, her eye; Slow o'er her heart came chilling death— Zulma is in eternity! THE DEATH SCENE. Glimmering amid the shadowy shapes that float In sickly Fancy's vision o'er the walls Of Death's lone room, the trembling taper burns Dimly, and guides my fearful eye to trace The wandering track of parting life upon The burning brow and sallow cheek of him Whose smile was paradise to me and mine. The autumnal wind breathes pantingly and comes With hollow sighs through yon high window o'er Thy feverish couch, my love! and seems to sob Amid the waving curtains as't would tell My heart how desolate it will become When left in its lone widowhood to weep And wail and agonize at Memory's tale. The outward air is chill, but, oh, thy breast, My dying love! is scorching with the fires That centre in thy heart, and thy hot breath Heaves sobbingly, like the sirocco gale That heralds death; and thou art speechless now Save what thy glaring eyes can tell, for life Is parting from thy bosom silently. Thy pulse is wild and wandering, and thy limbs Are writhing in convulsive agony, And, while thy spirit hovers o'er the verge Of Fate, thou canst not speak to me nor bid Thy chosen one a long farewell! O Heaven! Let thy sweet mercy wait upon his end And life's last struggle close—'tis vain to hope For life—then take his soul on gentle wing Away, and let the sufferer rest with Thee! Alas! hath He who rules the universe Replied to my wild wish? oh, give me back The spirit of my love for one brief hour—'tis o'er! 'Tis o'er! my love, my happiness, my hope. I sit beside a corse! How deadly still Is the lone chamber he hath left! The moan Of dying nature, and the bursting sigh Of a heart breaking, and the murmuring voice Of a delirious spirit—all are hushed! The eye that kindled love in my young heart And told me I was blessed, is lustreless— And those dear lips, that oft illumed my soul, Are stiffening now; those features exquisite, On which I often gazed as on a mirror Beaming with beauty, genius, feeling—all That love adores and honor sanctifies, Collapse in their dread slumbers and assume The ashen deadliness of soulless dust. And must it be, my love! that thou wilt sleep Where I can never watch thy wants and glide Around, thy gentle minister? No more Read voiceless wishes in thy pleading eye And soothingly discharge them? Art thou gone, Or is it but a dream? O thou dost dwell Within my heart unchangeably as wont And ever wilt!—I sit beside the Dead Alone, while round me the world is bent On pleasure—on a shadow from the dust! The bright blue wave of Hudson rolls below My solitary view and sounds of joy Fling music o'er its waters and the voice Of gayety is rising on my ear,— Like banquet mirth amid the pyramids. O the full consciousness of utter loss! The single wretchedness of cureless woe While all around are gay! The chaos wild Of billowy thought, on whose tumultuous tides Hopes, powers and passions—all the elements Of heart and soul in foamy whirlpools toss 'Till whelmed in ruin!—Lovely babe! thou hast No father now, and where, my orphan child! Will close our wanderings? I have no home For thee, dove of the storm without an ark To bear thee o'er the waters of the Waste! Cold, voiceless mansion of my ruined love! I'll close thine eyes and kiss thy pallid lips. And watch beside thee for the livelong night— The last, last night I shall behold thy form! O agony, and they will bury thee! Will snatch thee from the pillow of my heart, And lay thee in the damp unbreathing tomb! Sleep, my sweet child! thou knowest not the pain Of the sad bosom that thou slumberest on. It is some joy that thou feel'st not the loss Of him who would have worshipped his firstborn. The world is silent round me; pale the moon Gleams on the clay-shut eyes of him who loved Her gentle light in life, and o'er his cold, Collapsed, unchanging, melancholy face Plays her transparent beam of love. My heart! Thy bleeding tears would drown my soul, if yet One being lived not in my life to tell How dear he was to me. Farewell, my love! Our slumbers now will be no more as wont! Yet e'en in paradise thou wilt behold Thine earthly love and bend from heaven to shed Immortal hopes o'er nature's funeral urn. Days, weeks and months passed o'er me and were seen Vanishing away with that pale, meek content Which doth exist, against the spirit's will, So glad was I to feel that burden, Time, Dropping from my pierced heart; for I did live Among, but yet not with the living—tears Suppressed within the fountains of the soul, Congealed like waters in deep cavern-halls. My being passed 'mid shadows, and the things Familiar once assumed or unknown form Or appendage unknown, and to my eye The faces erst beloved appeared like those Imagination images in dreams; And oft I feared to speak, lest I should be Abandoned to my woe; and, if I spake, My voice re-echoed round me like the cries Of shipwrecked mariners at night. My brain Was fevered with my dreadful anguish, which Grew by repression, like the Rebel Flower, The Camomile Until it mastered reason, or whate'er Name that observant faculty doth bear Whose power is o'er the visible universe. There was a dread unmeasured, in my thought, A vague idea of something horrible, And I lived on like one in broken sleep, Forever searching for some lost companion, And wandering in mazes dark as doom, Where the heart faints and fails, and hope expires. Yet amid all the estranging of my love I still clung to my child; a mother's heart Retains its deep devotion to her dear And pang-bought offspring, when the woman's mind Is laid in ruins; and her bosom burns With love instinctive for an innocent And lovely creature whom her spirit knows Only as something worthy to be loved. Folding the orphan to my heart, I went Abroad the mansion witlessly, and searched Its chambers desolate, and then returned In wildered disappointment that the thing I looked for could no where be found.—I sat In the lone winter nights before the dim And melancholy embers, and did hush My breath while listening for the tread of him Who ever spent his evenings with his love In social converse;—but he came not, so I sighed and murmured to my prattling babe That he would soon return; but then I thought That he had gone to a far land and left His duties to my care and faithful watch. And so I oped his escritoir and saw His papers, pens and pencils and all things Reposed e'en as he left them, and I felt That I could not arrange them otherwise If they were wrong;—his closet then I searched And there his vestments hung familiarly And appositely arrayed.—I returned From such short wanderings sad, and sometimes thought My love had told me he should dwell no more Upon the earth—and then my heart did feel As if it floated in a lava sea. Thus passed my strange existence from the day He died until disease my infant laid Upon his suffering couch, and I became His sleepless watcher. Long I sat beside The lovely one, attending all his wants And sick caprices uncomplainingly, Yet all unconscious that he was my son, Till one said he was dying—then there flashed Through my dark spirit thoughts long dead, and tears Quenched the dull fire that burned upon my brain. And left my heart's fair path a desert way, Calm though 'twas dreary. Life hath direful ills And woes and sufferings, but the fiercest lie In madness, e'er in dread of heaven and earth. It cannot weep—it doth not think, and yet It hath both tears and thoughts, the one of blood, Of pangs the other; all its feelings coil Like serpents round the heart and sting the core Unceasingly, and all the sweet ideas Of love and friendship round the racked brain twine Like knotted adders, venomous and blind. Pierce, O thou Holy One! the heart, but spare The spirit! Let thy judgments fall upon The affections, but preserve the immortal soul! My child was spared me; and the tale I tell Was gathered from the loved ones who beheld But could not soothe my agony, and those Impressions I retain of sights and sounds That floated by me in bewilderment. It was the Sabbath's herald eve; and pained With melancholy musings, such as hearts Bleeding with sorrow nourish, forth I went To gaze on nature's pensive face and smile Of virgin softness, and I felt the sense Of her deep loveliness stealing o'er my woes While watching her pure countenance, now veil'd In moonlight and her changeful robes of green, Azure and silver-blended, while she looked Like one who was to me what angels are To paradise—the living fount of joy. A diamond star was floating 'mid the waves Of pearl, that danced along the silver wake Of Dian's bark, and it did seem like love Adorning innocence; while in the midst Of ether hung the rosy isles of bliss, Where spirits as they bear the hests of heaven And warder Zion's towers, lift up the songs That soaring souls forever sing above. The thought of meeting my beloved again, Filled all my soul with gladness; for we part But for a little season—a brief day, From earth to heaven, and, like the evening star Upon the azure verge of summer's sky, The soul embraceth two eternities. A sea of voices waked me from my dreams Of holier spheres, and told me of the earth, That held in its cold bosom all my loves, Save one sweet babe, the image of its sire Upon his lonely widow's heart! O Earth! Cold is the couch thy sons must sleep upon, And dark the chambers of their slumber deep. I looked around me and the vestal moon Was silvering the waters, o'er which scud, Swan-like, full many a silent sail bound far, Perchance, to fathomless eternity! And dazzling lamps, that seemed in the pale moon Like crime obtruding his unholy light Before rose-beaming virtue, glared above The blushing waters as they laughed in scorn. And in a sea-dome, studded o'er with lights That mocked the diamond, many a voice arose In merriment well feigned, and many a form Of outward splendour glided round to find Something to tell how happy all must be Who woo and win the pleasures of the world. Like earth's gay hopes, full oft a column rose Of fire far in the azure vault of night, And then it burst and vanished! some did watch The glittering fragments till they fell—then sighed— And I sighed too—they told me of my joys! It was no scene for me—the sights I saw Were once shared with those eyes that wake no more; The voices that I heard were all unknown; The arm I held was not my wedded lord's! 'Tis bitter to compare our passing years! The Dead! where are they now? The Living! what Are they to those whose hearts are in the tomb? Slow I returned to my lone room, and kissed My sleeping child, and looked to heaven—and wept.</field>
