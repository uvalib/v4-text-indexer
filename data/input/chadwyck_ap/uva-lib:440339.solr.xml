      <field name="fulltext">FRAGMENT I Who knows not that of late, though patient long, And loving peace, till peace herself grew vile, Our country raised at length her battle song, And hurled defiance to the haughty isle, That still with open force, or secret guile, Urges reluctant nations to prolong The flame that lights their own funereal pile, Claiming from power the right of doing wrong, Owning no law save such as suits the strong? Who knows not, too, how many a gallant band, Such as e'en Sparta's self were proud to own, Rushed to the summons, seized the glittering brand, Ere the first spirit-stirring trump had blown, Eager their country's injuries to atone, And all her glory, all her danger share: For who that hears my rude harp's faltering tone, Had not some brother, friend, or kinsman there, To claim full oft a wish, a sigh, a prayer? I too had once a brother! He was there Among the foremost, bravest of the brave: For him this lay was framed with fruitless care; Sisters for him the sigh in secret gave; For him a mother poured the fervent prayerâ But sigh or prayer availeth not to save! A generous victim in a villain's snare, He found a bloody, but inglorious grave, And never nobler heart was reached by baser [glaive]! FRAGMENT II The morn breaks gloriously!âthe wind is fairâ The bugle sounds, the boatswain's whistle cheers, The word is pastâfor parting all prepare, And many a lovely cheek is wet with tears: Brief space such scenes allow for woman's fears! A few fond wordsâa kissâa short embraceâ Thus sever they who meet no more for years! Perhaps who never meet on earth again! But mad Ambition only stops to trace His score of millions spent and thousands slain! The dreadful reckoning of the human race With him, war, pestilence, and all his train, He sees not, or, if seen, regards with cold disdain! All are embarked!âthe signal-gun they fire!â The gallant pinnace bounds before the wind, And dances on the waters! Mast and spire And tower and tree and town are left behind! And those who watch the bark receding, find Distance and sorrow's mists obscure her sail: The bar is pastâthe fresh'ning breeze is kindâ The pilot partsâround go the laugh and tale, And joyous thus the song floats far upon the gale! SEA SONG Sons of the deep! Ye spirits brave, Whose victories saved a nation's fame, From whom the ruler of the wave First learned the pangs of fear and shame! To you the cup is flowing free, To you we fill, where'er you roam, Whether you brave the stormy sea, Or dare the thunderer on his home. Skilful and boldâin hardship nurs'dâ By horrour taughtâby peril triedâ In danger and in glory firstâ Your country's hope, her joy, her pride! To your loved names, ye gallant few, Our souls the song of triumph raise, And after years shall swell for you âThe fondly lingering notes of praise.â Long may your flag its lustre shed O'er the wild waters of the main; Long may the laurel crown your head, And never, never wear a stain. To you, with soul-enamouring beam, Dear woman's melting eye shall turn, Your deeds shall be the sage's theme, And o'er the story youth shall burn! FRAGMENT III âBy heaven!â said Jacques, as carelessly he flung His tired limbs to earth, âthis life for me! 'Tis sweet, when every sinew is unstrung, Outstretched at length beneath the greenwood-tree, To rest from every care and sorrow freeâ Keenly to feast on coarse and homely cheer, To mark our soldiers' rude but honest glee, Then lay us down without a hope or fear, And soundly sleep till reveillÃ©e we hear!â FRAGMENT IV 'Tis many moons agoâa long, long time, Since first upon this shore a white man trod; From the great waters to the mountain clime, This was our homeâ'twas giv'n us by the GOD That gave you yours. Love ye your native sod? So did our fathers too! for they were MENâ They fought to guard itâfor their hearts were braveâ And long they fought!âWe were a people then! This was our countryâit is now our GRAVEâ Would I had never livedâor died this land to save! When first ye came, your numbers were but few, Our nation many as the leaves or sand; Hungry and tired ye wereâwe pitied youâ We called you brothersâtook you by the hand; But soon we found ye came to spoil the land: We quarrelledâand your countrymen we slew, Till one alone of all, remained behindâ Among the false he only had been trueâ And much we loved this man of single mind, And ever while he lived to him were kind. He loved us too, and taught us many things, And much we strove the stranger's heart to glad; But to its kindred still the spirit clings, And therefore was his soul for ever sad; Nor other wish nor joy the lone one had, Save on the solitary shore to roam, Or sit and gaze for hours upon the deep That rolled between him and his native home; And when he thought none marked him, he would weep, Or sing this song of wo[e] which still our maidens keep: LAMENT OF THE CAPTIVE My life is like the summer rose That opens to the morning sky, And, ere the shades of evening close, Is scattered on the ground to die: Yet on that rose's humble bed The softest dews of night are shed; As if she wept such waste to seeâ But none shall drop a tear for me! My life is like the autumn leaf That trembles in the moon's pale ray; Its hold is frailâits date is briefâ Restless, and soon to pass away: Yet, when that leaf shall fall and fade, The parent tree will mourn its shade, The wind bewail the leafless tree, But none shall breathe a sigh for me! My life is like the print, which feet Have left on TAMPA's desert strand. Soon as the rising tide shall beat, Their track will vanish from the sand: Yet, as if grieving to efface All vestige of the human race, On that lone shore loud moans the sea, But none shall thus lament for me! Poems: Fugitive and Occasional TO IOLE Multa quidem scripsi: sed quae vitiosa putavi Emendaturis ignibus ipse dedi. Tum quoque, cÃ¹m fugerem, quaedam placitura cremavi Iratus studio, carminusque meis.â Ovid. Tristia. Lib. IV El. X Sweet Iole! with pure and warm emotion, I lay these worthless offerings at thy shrine, And with them a true heart whose fond devotion Is such as sister saints might feel for thine: Grant me thy prayers!âand oh! disdain not mineâ But if henceforth none ever hear or see Our cherished creed avouch'd by word or sign It is because men call idolatry The worship we have always deemed divine. The World's misjudging incredulity Allows no sacred light on earth to shine Or understands it not if seenâand we Must the true faith in our soul's cell confine Or brave the persecutor's cruelty. SOLOMON AND THE GENIE âAt the sight of so terrible a figure, the fisherman would have fled, but was too much terrified. âSolomon, Solomon, the great Prophet!â exclaimed the Genie, âpardon, pardon, pardon! I never more will oppose your will!â The fisherman hearing this took courage, and said âThou proud spirit what is it thou talkest of? It is 1800 years ago since the prophet Solomon died. Tell me your history and how you came to be shut up in that vessel.â The Genie, turning to his deliverer with a fierce look, said, âthou art very bold to call me a proud spirit. Speak to me more civilly lest I kill thee.â âWhatâ replied the fisherman âwould you kill me for setting you at liberty? Is that the way you reward the service I have done you?â âI can't treat you otherwiseâ replied the Genie, âand that you may be convinced of it listen to my story: I am one of those rebellious spirits, who opposed themselves to the will of Heaven. The other Genies owned Solomon the great prophet, and submitted to him. Sacar and I only resisted. That potent monarch caused me to be seized and brought by force before his throne.ââ Arabian Nights Spirit of Thought! Lo! art thou here? Lord of the false fond ceaseless spell That mocks the heart, the eye the ear:â In human bosoms dost thou dwell Self-exiled from thy native sphere, Or is the human mind thy cell Of torment?âto inflict and bear Thy doom?âthe doom of all who fell. Since thou hast sought to prove my skill Unquestioned thou shalt not depart, Be thy behests or good, or ill, No matter what, or whence thou art: I will commune with thee apart, Yea, and compel thee to my will If thou hast power to yield my heart What Earth and Heaven deny it still. I know thee Spirit! thou hast been Light of my soul by night and day, All-seeing, though thyself unseen, My dreamsâmy thoughtsâand what are they But visions of a calmer rayâ All, all were thineâand thine between Each hope that melted fast away The throb of anguish, deep and keen. With thee I've searched the earth, the sea, The air, sun, stars, man, nature, time, Explored the universe with thee, Plunged to the depths of woe and crime, Or dared the fearful height to climb Where amid glory none may see And live, the Eternal reigns sublime Who is, and was, and is to be! And I have sought, with thee have sought Wisdom's celestial path to tread, Hung o'er each page with learning fraught, Questioned the living and the dead; The Patriarchs of ages fledâ The Prophets of the time to comeâ All who one ray of light could shed Beyond the cradle or the tomb. And I have tasked my busy brain To learn what haply none may know; Thy birth, seat, powerâthine ample reign O'er the heart's tides, that ebb and flow, Throb, languish, whirl, rage, freeze, or glow, Like billows of the restless main Above the wrecks of joy and woe By ocean's caves preserved in vain. And oft, to shadow forth I strove To my mind's eye, a form like thine, And still my soul like Noah's dove Returned, but brought alas! no sign: 'Till wearying in the mad design With fevered brow and throbbing vein I left the cause to thread the mine Of wonderful effects again. But now I see thee face to face Thou art indeed a thing divine An eye pervading time and space And an angelic look are thine, Ready to seize, compare, combine, Essence and formâand yet a trace Of grief and care a shadowy line Dims thy bright forehead's heavenly grace. Yet thou must be of heavenly birth Where naught is known of grief or pain; Though I perceive alas! where Earth And earthly things have left their stain: From thine high calling didst thou deign To proveâin folly or in mirthâ With daughters of the first born Cain How little Human Love was worth? Ha! dost thou change before my eyes? Another form! and yet the same, But lovelier, and of female guise Such as our heart's despair can frame Pine for, love, worship, idolize, Like Her's who from the sea-foam came, And lives but in the heart or skies. Spirit of Change! I know thee too, I know thee by thine Iris bow, By thy cheeks ever-shifting hue By all that marks thy steps below, By sighs that burn and tears that glowâ False hopesâvain joys that mock the heart From Fancy's urn, these evils flow Spirit of Lies! for such thou art! Saidst thou not once that all the charms Of life lay hid in woman's love And to be lock'd in Beauty's arms Was all man knew of Heaven above? And did I not thy counsels prove With all their pleasure, all their pain No more, no more my heart they move For I alas! have proved them vain! Didst thou not then, in evil hour Light in my soul Ambition's flame Didst thou not say the joys of Power Unbounded swayâundying fame A Monarch's love alone should claim? And did I not pursue all these, And are they not when won the same All Vanity of Vanities? Didst not to tempt me once again Bid new deceitful visions rise And hint though won with toil and pain âWisdom's the pleasure of the Wiseâ And now when none beneath the skies Are wiser held by men than me What is the value of the prize It too alas! is Vanity Then tell me!âsince I've found on earth Not one pure stream to slake this thirst Which still torments us from our birth And in our heart and soul is nurst This hopeless wish wherewith we're curst, Whence came it, and why was it given? Thou speak'st not!âLet me know the worst Thou pointest!âand it is to Heaven! [Farewell fair Florence! not I hope forever] Farewell fair Florence! not I hope forever, Once more I yet may see theeâWho can tell? With thee and thine it is a pang to sever I had not thought to feel again. ... Farewell! Florence farewell! the memories earthly cherished That for long years in my hearts core did dwell By Time and Death and Chance and Change have perished Thou and thine only now are left! ... Farewell! Farewell! farewell! ... and if indeed foreverâ The thoughts untold that in my bosom swell Can never be forgotten!ânever! never! Blessings on thee and thine! ... Farewell! Farewell! Farewell! once moreâIf the enfranchised spirit May haunt the spots it loved in life so well 'Till Earth dissolve with all it doth inherit Mine shall be with thee Florence still! ... Farewell! FRAGMENT 'Tis many moons agoâa long long time Since first upon this shore a white man trodâ From the great water to the mountain clime This was our homeâ'twas given us by the God That gave ye yoursâLove ye your native sod? So did our fathers too, for they were men, They fought to guard it for their hearts were brave, And long they foughtâWe were a people then!

TO ? Farewell! ... I take no formal leave, Though lingering round each much loved spot, For me, I wish no heart to grieve, Though mine has ne'er one friend forgot. But who would deem that there could dwell Beneath the careless mirth they hear Thoughts, for their depth unfit to tell Feelings, unbreathed to mortal ear? A fountain sealedâsepulchral lampâ A sibyls leafâa funeral urnâ A dim drear vault, where cold and damp Death and decay's pale vapours burn. Such is, or such at least may be, For aught thou knowest, the soul I bearâ No more!âWhy should I claim from thee In weal or woe of mine to share? I go!âFarewell!âagain farewell! The first slight pang of parting o'er, With the forgotten past I dwell, And thou wilt think of me no more. Like waters of the silvery lake That o'er the chance-thrown pebble close, The slight heart-thrill my follies make Will soon subside to calm repose. And I shall be as one unknown, Or if once known remembered notâ Like a fantastic shadow flown, Or fleeting vision soon forgot. 'Tis wise!â'tis well!âI do not ask One tear, one sigh from thee or thine: They chose indifference for their task Deep sad remembrance, I, for mine! FORGET ME NOT Forget me not! where'er we rove Whate'er may be our varied lot In stately hall or shady grove Forget me not! ... forget me not! Forget me not! O! I could see Unmoved my name Oblivion blot So I were but the same to thee Forget me not! ... forget me not! Forget me not! on land or main O! let me never be forgot In weal or woeâin Joy or Pain Forget me not! ... forget me not! Forget me not! by every scene We sawâby each familiar spotâ By all we lovedâby all we've been, Forget me not! ... forget me not! Forget me not! by every hour Together passed in wood or grot By the heart's spell of nameless power Forget me not! ... forget me not! Forget me not! though severed far, By thy dear homeâthy nurse's cot Thy native landâthy natal star Forget me not! ... forget me not! THE SIGNS OF LOVE The sleepless eye, The frequent tear, The deep drawn sigh, Of Hope and Fear Are they not Love's? But sighs may feign And tears betray, And Guilt and Pain And slow decay, Are they not Love's? Then would'st thou know The false from true, Through bliss and woe Still keep in view, What signs are Love's? The silent tear, The secret sigh, Unheard by ear, Unseen by eye, These, these are Love's! The looks which hide, Not those that shew, What one beside, Alone should know, These, these are Love's! Pangs whose kind art Veils their excess, That one fond heart May feel them less: These, these are Love's! The powers that reign, With tranquil air, O'er untold pain And mute despair; These, these are Love's! The breast that aches But never swells, The heart that breaks Yet never tells, These, these are Love's! [The dream of life is over] The dream of life is over, The light of love is gone, O! who would be a rover On earth like me alone. My early joys are blighted, My friends are with the blest, Deserted and benighted, I long to be at rest. My leave of life I'm taking, I feel this cannot last Yet though my heart is breaking, It's sighs are for the past. I feel my moments flying But ere I cease to be My latest prayer when dying Will be blessings upon thee! LINES IN AN ALBUM Dear Record of departed years! Our thoughts recessâour Memory's faneâ Sacred to all our Hopes and Fears, To Love and Griefâto Joy and Pain. Recalling many a faded face, And picturing many an altered mind, On every page we find a trace Which those we loved have left behind. The Heart's Eolian lyre that flings To every passing breath its tone Thrilling from wild deep wond'rous strings A sweet sad music all it's own. Shrine of past spellsâand long lost powers Map of the soulâaffection's chartâ Memorial of fast fading hoursâ I hail thee, scripture of the heart! TO ? Farewell! ... a word we shrink to speak, or hear, Of cherished hours the melancholy knell, Nor heard, nor spoke, without a boding fear That it may be forever. ... Fare ye well! Farewell! ... and if forever, will ye not Think of your friend and the last look he gave? One thought from you, though by the world forgot Were as a flower to deck his nameless grave. Farewell! farewell! ... His pilgrimage of woes End when, and where, and howsoe'er it will, Can only bring an aching heart repose And bid a throbbing brain at length be still. Farewell! once more ... if e'er his soul finds rest He might but leave with those he loved a spell To keep them happyâblessing all and blest It should be breathed in his last wordâFarewell! [Light be the turf on thy tomb] Light be the turf on thy tomb! Bright be the place of thy rest! Thy spirit has fled in it's beauty and bloom To its home, the abode of the blest. The depth of our love and our woe, And all that this trial hast cost No hearts save those only, can know Who have owned such a treasure and lost! We cherish thy memory here, While in humble affliction we bow, And Heaven will pardon our sorrow a tear, Since thou ne'er cost us one until now. SONNET Friend of my early days! the same kind soul Whom as a fair, mild, studious boy I knew, The tide of feeling bursts from all control To hail once more those times, those scenes, and you! Mine was a melancholy youth 'tis true Born to the orphan's heritage of woe, Slight leisure love or hope or joy it knew And soon was quenched the buoyant spirit's flow: Therefore perhaps, those hours so bright and few Of happy boyhood on my memory glow With all imaginations brilliant hue Sun beams from showers reflectedâEven so Returns the vision of the past anew Shining through tears the souls celestial bow! TO ? Utinam modo dicere possem Carmina digna Deae. Ovid. Seek other bards to hymn thy praise, It is no theme for lips like mine; Worthy of purer, holier lays, A harp and minstrel more divine. This proud, worn heart may once have known Some chords that might have claimed thine ear, Perhaps there lingers yet a tone, Thou would'st not all disdain to hear. But I have stirr'd for good and ill, Too deeply all its secret strings, Joys maddening note, Grief's freezing thrill And Disappointment's fiery stings. Extreme and passionate in all, LoveâHatredâPleasureâPainâDisgustâ In stormy flight and endless fall Above the cloudsâbelow the dust. No, 'tis too late! ... There was a time I could perhaps have struck a sound, Which like the Vespers hallowed chime Might wake a sacred echo round. Such strain would well become thy name A heavenly anthem sweet and calm, Like incense from the altar's flame Breathing a more than earthly balm. But now. ... No more! ... that time is pastâ I must not wake one note for thee, The seal is setâthe die is cast And I fullfill my destiny! Aye! leave me to my wayward fate, My praise thy virtues would but stain, And worth, I may not consecrate, I prize too highly to prophane. Then seek somewhere to hear thy praise It is no theme for lips like mine, No! it belongs to holier lays, A harp and minstrel more divine. LINES FOR MUSIC Fare thee well! the words are spoken Can they be unuttered ever? ... Fare thee well! my heart is broken But we meet no more wherever! Never!âneverâno, no, never! No we meet no more forever! Fare thee well! with bitter anguish Now I feel that we must severâ Years like ages, did I languish Thus to part with thee forever? Aye! forever ... Ever! ... ever! Never more to meet, no! never! Fare thee well! thou unforgiving, Henceforth 'twere a vain endeavour Faith to find among the living, Thou hast broke that dream forever! Ever! ... ever! ... yes!, yes, ever! Never to return! ... no! never! THE GUINEA FOWL On the device of a seal with the legend âCome back!â There is a sort of feathered scold Whose note is (if the truth be told) Much like a vixen's clack, Morn, noon, and night the sound you hear, Still ringing in your deafened ear, âCome back! Come back! Come back!â When forced to leave a pleasant home, Upon the world's wide waste to roam, Our sinking hearts alack! Feel all their devils doubly blue, If some of this discordant crew Cry out, âCome back! Come back!â But if with travel, toil and pain Worn out, we're hastening home again, Our fancy has a knack ... Of making even discord sweet, Which seems our own return to greet, With Welââcome back, come back!â My song, much like the throat it mocks, As shrill as winds and hard as rocks, (Since rhyme is growing slack) As it began perforce must end By crying out with every friend âCome back! come back! come back!â LINES ON THE FIRST LEAF OF AN ALBUM Here Memory, and here too Oblivion dwells: One o'er the tablet weaves his drowsy spells The other in the fount her pinion wets Who writes remembers, she who reads forgets! [I knew that this must endâat first] I knew that this must endâat first I said it would be soâ Nor do I grieve to prove the worst Of long foreboded woe: I do not shrink from what I bear, I only feel what thou must share. I even smile to hear thee chide My silenceâyet suppress My once free thoughts, because I hide My pangs, to make thine less: Though my heart breaks, I do not dare To add my own to thy despair. I muse forever on the past Although I only mourn ... O'er what I knew could never last And know can ne'er return: And thou who sigh'st because I seem A dreamerâmust not know my dream. I once believed the great relief Of my full heart would be ... In every joy and every grief To share them all with thee; But I have learned that there are woes Which I must feel yet ne'er disclose. Whate'er they are, it matters not So they are never knownâ By me they cannot be forgot, But must be mine alone: They will go with me to the tomb, But shall not cloud thy brow with gloom. [The future bard of Paradise in youth] The future bard of Paradise in youth, Wearied, some half hour on a moss bank slept, And female beauty, innocence and truth, Watch o'er his slumbers for an instant kept. He wakedâand foundâplaced there while he reposed, This sweet Ausonian couplet in his handâ âEyes! mortal stars, if thus ye wound me closed, Openâwho could your witchery withstand?â The circles of their being touched no moreâ He never saw her!âThough in after years, Fair Italy received him on her shore Aye! and baptised his genius with her tears! Quenched were those eyes in darkness, want and strife, He never saw her!âYet our fancy deems, To the last moment of his stormy life A lovely vision haunted all his dreams. SONNET TO LORD BYRON Byron! 'tis thine alone on Eagle's pinions In solitary strength and grandeur soaring To dazzle and delight all eyes out-pouring The electric blaze on tyrants and their minions: Earth, Sea and Air, and Powers, and Dominions, NatureâManâTimeâthe Universe exploring And from the wreck of Worlds, Thrones, Creeds, Opinions, Thought, beauty, eloquence, and wisdom storing. O! how I love, and envy thee thy glory! To every age and clime alike belonging, Linked by all tongues, with every nation's story, Thou Tacitus of song!âwhose echoes thronging O'er the Atlantic, fill the mountains hoary And forests, with the name my verse is wronging! [There is a narrow cheerless cell] Heaven's sovereign spares all creatures but himself That hideous sight a naked human heart. Young. There is a narrow cheerless cell Silent and sad, and cold and deep, A living grave, which yet full well Can its dark dreadful secrets keep. A whited sepulchreâit seems Goodly enough in outward shew, And he who marks it, seldom deems, How much corruption lurks below. But yet though fair and bright above, Beneath, the worm hath left her slime, O'er withered Hope, and ruined love, Corroding grief and festering crime. A prison-houseâwhose tortures shun The light, yet rend the soul like steel, A horrid mystery, which none Can quite suppress, nor quite reveal; It is the dungeon of despair, At half its feelings heaven might start, It's very thoughts would taint the air, It is, it isâThe Human Heart! [The full levee, the crowded hall] The full levee, the crowded hall The gay salon I once could tread, Mix in the mask, the fÃªte, the ball, And share them tooâthose times have fled! With listless eyes, the giddy throng So joyous onceâso tedious nowâ I mark to loathe and scornâand long To wear my thoughts upon my brow. And yet I know and feel full well The change is not in them but meâ Life has lost Hope's delusive spell And isâbut one sad phantasy. Fled is the dream that ne'er returnsâ Broken charm that ne'er unitesâ And my soul faintly dimly burns Like a past revel's dying lights. Why should I ghost-like haunt the scene Of former joys in silent gloom The mournful shade of what I've been, The living tenant of a tomb? No! no, to crowds a long farewell Give me a desert or a cave The Hermits grotâthe friar's cell Or better still than allâa grave! REPLY TO SOME MELANCHOLY VERSES BEGINNING âWHY DO WE LIVE?â Why do we live? The answer lies In every flower that springs: In every star that decks the skies, In every bird that sings: In all that makes the Earth so fair, What would we have which is not there? Why do we live? Is there no ear Such cruel words would wound? Is there no eye whose ready tear Would answer to their sound? We live because our death would throw On others all our weight of woe! [In youth's first flush when hearts are light] In youth's first flush when hearts are light And hopes are high, and spirits gay, When all the Earth around seems bright And life one joyous holiday. It is not then, when hall or bower With careless festive steps we tread, Affection's deepest, purest power, Upon unsuffering souls is shed. 'Tis when unuttered miseries melt When our long cherished hopes decayâ When bitter disappointment's feltâ And some desertâand some betrayâ O! it is then, one fond true heart Is tried and proved, and loved and prized, Like sibyl's leaves the wasted part But makes the rest more idolized! THE POET TO HIS LYRE And would they tame thee down my lyre Checking thy fall and swell To make thee whatâharmonious wire A modulated shell? Ah! where were then thy native fire And thy heart-moving spell? No! let them teach their tuneful art To nightingale or dove Thou canst not be a thing of art Below itâor aboveâ Thou'rt but the echo of the heart The murmur of it's love. No! as beneath the moonbeam pale To every breeze that springs, The sweet wild minstrel of the gale Her fitful music flings, So must thy master's strange sad tale Thrill from thy trembling strings! AT NIGHT When life is young And Hope has flung O'er all to come her rainbow light How deeply thrill Our pulses still To the light step that comes at night! When those we loved Away have roved And home has lost it's chief delight, How briskâhow free, How cheerfully, Sounds their returning step by night! When Fortune parts Two kindred hearts, And threatens all their joy to blight, What hopes, what fears, What smiles, what tears, Wait the light step that comes at Night! When Love is kind, And hearts are twined, In fond affection pure and bright, How quick the ear, That waits to hear, The loved light step that comes at Night! WRITTEN IN AN ALBUM When the lone exile sees at last His loved his early home once more, How rushes on his mind the past How his full heart at length runs o'er! Yet every face and spot he knew, Are seen with mingled joy and pain, To mark of all he left, how few, Hearts, hopes, or scenes unchanged remain. And thus perhaps, in after years, To turn these leaves will but recall, Moments of smiles, and days of tears, Friends, joys, hopes, loves, all lost! all! all! SONNET Calm mother of the night! on whose wild brow LoveâSolitudeâHigh thought, and Peace have thrown Immortal loveliness which shines even now As in creation's infancy it shone; When first serenely from thy starry throne On Earth thou gazed ..., as on thy sleeping child, And watched its couch in silence, and alone, And tranquilly upon its slumbers smiled. Now bowed with yearsâand moreâwith crimes defiled, Its infancy and innocence are o'er While there eternal Beauty pure and mild, Lonely and sweet and pensive as before Falls on our heartsâand all their passions wild Beneath thine eye maternal throb no more! WRITTEN ON THE LEAF OF AN ALBUM UNDER TWO DOVES BILLING Ye dear little doves, Whose innocent loves, So pleasantly rhyming, our poets delight; And billing, and cooing, Wedding or wooing, Your bills on our billets-doux sweetly unite. I protest my heart thrills, At the sight of your bills, Such accounts, and discounts, I should like to arrange But say what ye will, It were much better still, To exchange both your bills for a bill of Exchange. SONNET FROM THE PORTUGUESE OF CAMOENS Flow on silver stream to the Ocean! Through thy margin of osiers and willows Thou fleest with eager and tremulous motion To court the embrace of its billows: 'Till sinking at length on their bosom to bliss In the transport of constant devotion They welcome their wanderer home with a kiss Of the deepest and purest emotion. Thy stream like the loitering Scamander's Through mazes tow'rd pleasure is winding But alas! for my poor heart that wanders Amid objects forever reminding Sad thought, that Life vainly meanders Lost hopes, and past joys never finding! EPIGRAM ON A DULL PREACHER FROM THE ITALIAN OF RONCALLI On the miseries of life and mankind's wretched lot A very long lesson you teach: But sure the worst misery of all you've forgot The misery of hearing you preach! SONNET FROM THE PORTUGUESE OF CAMOENS My years were short and troubled upon earth, And all my moments wretched though so few; The bitter boon Fate gave me at my birth Ere my fifth lustre ended she withdrew. Strange lands and unknown seas I wandered through Seeking for life some palliative or cure, But that which no kind chance before me threw Nor travel, toil, nor peril might procure Nor all that mortal man could dare or do Deviseâattemptâencounterâor endure. On Lusitania's nursing breast I grew My home Alemquer and the sea my grave: A tyrants jealousy the cause that drew Destruction on my headâit's cause a slave! EPITAPH ON A POET FROM THE ITALIAN OF RONCALLI Beneath this stone a poet's bones lie cold: Innumerable odes he madeâand soldâ Think, reader think, how many lies he told! SONNET FROM THE PORTUGUESE OF CAMOENS âCampo nas Syrtes deste mar da vidaâ &amp;c To thee sunny isle in this ocean of life, Last hope of the shipwrecked I fly! Thou art dear as are moments of bliss after strife Or bright spots in a storm-clouded sky: O'er the foes whom I shun there's no conquest but flight And if place changes fortune, at last I change mine The victory's sureâand I hail with delight O'er love and ambition a triumph divine: I'll while life away, in these calm shady bowers Where the murmur of waters falls sweet on the ear, Where the Autumn brings fruits and the Summer gives flowers And the Nightingale's love song is heard all the year; Where buried forever past cares, and lost powers, Content and Repose shall become doubly dear! [Cast up a wreck by Fortune's tide] Cast up a wreck by Fortune's tide, The ebbing wave in this lone bay Has left me by the ocean's side Mouldering in sure and slow decay; Love, Hope, Fame, Power, have past away And with them Joy and Grief and Pride I live but in my thoughts, and they Are of the things that long have died! TO ? But yesterday, these flowers Hung blooming on their stem; But yesterday, my hours, Were bright and gay like them: Tomorrow, fadedâperishedâ They will be flung away; So the fond hopes I cherished, Must wither with today! LINES WRITTEN IN MARY[']S âRELIQUIARIUMâ Hail to these venerable wrecks of Time! Precious and rare memorials of the brave, The wiseâthe goodâthe great of every clime Where Man is notâor should not beâa slave! To these most sacred treasures of the heart In deep, devout humility I bow, Linger before the shrine, and loath to part Repeat my âaveâ and renew my vow. An unknown lonely Pilgrim from afar, By shipwreck on the World's wide desert cast, My only guide a solitary star, I reached this Temple's vestibule at last; And bending thus, as at Loretto's fane, I pour most fervently my secret prayer, That after years like centuries of pain, I too, the Virgin-Mother's Peace share. Offering alas! it is not mine to makeâ I have none worthy of Madonna's name, To meditate and worship, for her sakeâ Not to record my piety, I came. But yet if more than silver, gems, or gold, Avail the widow's mite, and sinner's tear, A tribute never to be bought or sold, The honest tribute of the heart, is here! [Mary farewell! Like the ill-omened toll] Mary farewell! Like the ill-omened toll Of tocsin, curfew hour, or passing bell That word of fear and misery strikes the soul With an unutterable pangâFarewell! Farewell! to one so lov'd, so idolized, So praisedâso flatter'dâhumble verse can tell No noveltyâthou know'st how thou art prizedâ How much thou wilt be missed &amp; mournedâFarewell! Farewell! farewell! the parting hour is nigh, When silently, the bursting heart must swell, With all that Earth but utters in a sigh, The exstacy of wretchedness!âFarewell! Farewell! once moreâhow many an hour of years Are in those words! O! that they were a spell To save thy heart from woeâthine eyes from tearsâ And I would die in breathing them!âFarewell! Farewell! farewell!âif on the loveliest scene At Twilight's hour, the Day's departing knell, Should but recall the half of all I've been, Wilt thou not long for me?âFarewell! farewell! LOVE AND REASON ON THE DEVICE OF A SEAL REASON GIVING WINGS TO LOVE WITH THE LEGEND âSE VEDE, VOLAâ Venus once bound on Cupid's eyes A fillet stolen from Fancy's bow, And sent him wandering from the skies To seek his fortune here below. With face of sun-shine soul of mirth He roved through wood and mead and bower Making a sweeter heaven on earth Such was of Fancy's spell the power. Sometimes he thought he chased through air The loveliest butterfliesâand laugh'd While wounding many a bosom fair To see them fluttering on his shaft. Reason who found an infant boy Blindfold, alone, and far astray In hopes to give the urchin joy In pity tore the web away. Love sawâbut with returning sight Vanished the charm by Fancy given Earth now for him held no delight And the boy longed and pined for heaven. Her own rash kindness Reason blamed And the fond spell would fain restore, It might not beâher power it shamed The fillet would unite no more! âGo! then,â she cries and o'er him flings Down pinions of most rosy hue, âGo say 'twas Reason gave thee wings!â The urchin smiled, obeyed and flew! Lovers, who listen to the tale, Mark well the moral it supplies, Do not let Reason rend Love's veil Remember if he sees he flies! Every one will at once trace the origin of these lines to Moore's Love and Reason and Lord Byron'sââLove has no gift so grateful as his wings.â [Bright as the diamond of the mine] Bright as the diamond of the mine Soft as the azure of the sky, Of earthly things the most divine, Is woman's eye. Gay sweet and warm as laughing beams Sporting around a sunny isle, Or glittering spray from falling streams, Is woman's smile. Melodious as the soft south breeze The voice of waters, song of birds, Or ripple slight of summer seas, Are woman's words. Delicious as the breath of Spring At morn upon the mountain's tip, While flowers their odours round her fling, Is Woman's lip. â... [Manu,] the great lawgiver of Hindustan's long catalogue of things pure and impure, says the âmouth of a woman is constantly pure,â and he ranks it with the running waters and the sun beams. He suggests that their names should be agreeable, soft, clear captivating the fancy auspicious, ending in long vowels, resembling words of benediction.â Tod's Rajahst'han. Vol. 1. p. 611 Pure soft and mild as silver light That smiles upon us from above Shed by the orbs that rule the night Is Woman's Love! [At home, with other friends, in after years] At home, with other friends, in after years, When scenes together trod, thou shalt recall And Italy returns mid smiles and tears FlorenceâRomeâNaplesâBaiaeâPaestumâall! With them may come the thought of one whose name Might never else have crossed thy lips or mind: One, who with thee and them, found more than fame, And less than Memory would not leave behind. FEMALE INFLUENCE I own I love the boundless sway To woman's gentle spirit given It cheers life's dull and dreary way And smooths the path to hell or heaven. And she too, in her joys and woes Such is great Nature's mingled plan Seeks in her turn supportâreposeâ AffectionâConfidenceâfrom man. The son upon his mother's heart In all his boyish cares relies, In every grief she bears a part And every little want supplies. The daughter in her sire's embrace Feels of her wildest whim secure, How could he frown on such a face Or chide a thing so sweetâso pure? Of mutual heartsâmaturer years Marriage, and loveâI will not sing Most knowâor mayâtheir smiles and tears Hopes, Joys, âand all that sort of thing.â But even in Piety, love shares, Men's orisons Madonnas claim, While Joseph hears most female prayers Or wouldâbut for his luckless name. SONNET The friendless captive in his lonely tower Which air and light and liberty denies, Forgotten victim of despotic power Consumes his bitter life in useless sighs: For him in vain suns rise, and set, and rise, And moons of tranquil beauty wax and wane, On the calm azure of the star-lit skies, For mountain, stream, and wood, and earth and main, Are hid forever from his grief-worn eyes, Which drop their fruitless tears like desert rain, Only to rust the more his cankered chain. So I heart-prisoned, from whose love hope flies Reft of all life, save what is wrung from pain, In darkness nurse the worm that never dies! ON BREAKING THE CHAIN OF A LOCKET I've worn it in my bosom night and day A talisman of bliss ... and now the chain Which bore it breaksâIs it an omen say! That we too sever ne'er to meet again? Aye! 'tis the curse of gold to sunder so, All all the ties that love and nature twine Take the freed pledge!â'tis yoursâyes take itâgo! The severed chain and broken heart are mine!

Unbounded wealthâperpetual youthâ Eternal lifeâwhat are they all Compared with fond unwavering Truth Heaven's only relic since the fall. Who that has loved and been beloved Would change for all the world can give The one bright spell his heart has proved Without which 'tis not life to live. BirthâRichesâTalentâGloryâFriends, All man can ask or fate supply Are nothing 'till affection lends It's own delicious Alchemy. Whence has all Joy and Beauty birth? Who lights the sun the stars the wave? Whose magic gladdens Heaven and Earth? Whose eye first pierced beyond the grave? Love! Love, Almighty love! reply All those who worship and rejoiceâ But absence-tortured votaries sigh And bitter Memory finds no voice! [It was as if he had been cast] It was as if he had been cast Alone upon a desert shore, Silent but for the tempest's blast Deathlike but for the ocean's roar. It is as if at once he found To minister unto him there One who made all enchanted ground A gentle spirit of the air It was as if his heart had died And turned his bosom to a tomb Where young affection hope and pride Lay wrapped in everlasting gloom. It is as if an angel came And rolled the marble weight away Relighted the extinguished flame And called it back to life and day. It was as if the fiery wind Over his life and thoughts had blown With withering breathâand left behind But wrecks the soul's Simoom had strewn. It is as if Armida's art See Tasso's Gerusalemme Liberata Book XV Restoring all that was destroyed Watering with tears the wasted heart Had filled with flowers the aching void. âWatering the heart whose early flowers have diedâ Byron ON A SUN-DIAL NEAR VENICE with the inscription âHoras non numero nisi serenas.â Let others in some dreary clime Of fogs and storms, and snows and showers, Scan the slow lapse of lingering Time, I only count unclouded hours. Beneath calm, pure, and brilliant skies, Where all is sunshine, mirth, and flowers, I seize each moment as it flies And truly tell the cloudless hours. When Heaven withdraws its cheerful ray From pleasure's waste and leafless bowers, I take no heed of night or day, I only note unclouded hours. Learn then from me this rule of life, When Fortune smiles or danger lowers In bliss or woe in peace or strife Learn but to mark unclouded hours. ODE TO EASE âOtia, judicio semper amata meo.â Ovid. I never bent at Glory's shrine To Wealth I never bowed the knee Beauty has heard no vows of mine I love thee Ease, and only thee. Beloved of the Gods and men Sister of Joy and Liberty When wilt thou visit me agen In shady wood or silent glen, By fading stream or rocky den, Like those where once I found thee when, I listened to thy Syren voice And made thee mistress of my choice? I chose thee Ease and Glory fled For me no more her laurels spread Her golden crown shall never shed Its beams of splendor on my head, And when within the narrow bed To fame and memory ever dead My wretched corpse is thrown: Nor stately column sculptur'd bust Nor urn that holds within its trust The poor remains of mortal dust Nor monumental stone ... Nor willow waving in the gale Nor feeble fence with whitened pale Nor rustic cross, memorial frail! Shall mark the grave I own. But to all future ages lost Not even a wreck tradition-tost Of what I was when valued most By the few friends whose love I boast In after years shall float to shore And serve to tell the name I bore. I chose thee Ease! and Wealth withdrew Indignant at the choice I made, And to her first resentment true, My scorn with tenfold scorn repaid: And vowed my folly I should rue In poverty's benumbing shade. Now noble palace, lofty dome, Or cheerful hospitable home, Are blessings I must never know: My enemies shall ne'er repine At pomp or pageantry of mine Or prove by bowing at my shrine Their souls are abject base and low; And worst of all I shall not live To taste the pleasures wealth can give When used to soothe another's woe. The peasants of my native land Shall never bless my open hand No wandering bard shall celebrate His Patron's hospitable gate No war-warn soldier, shattered tar, Nor exile driven from afar Nor hapless friend of former years Nor widows prayers nor orphan's tears Nor helpless age relieved from cares Nor innocence preserved from snares Nor houseless wanderer clothed and fled, Nor slave from bitter bondage led, Nor youth to noble actions bred, Shall call down blessings on my head. I chose thee Ease! and yet the while So sweet was Beautys scornful smile So fraught with every lovely wile Yet seemingly, so void of guile, It did but heighten all her charms: And Goddess, had I loved thee then, But with the common love of men My fickle heart had changed agen Even at the very moment when I wooed thee to my longing arms: For never may I hope to meet A smile so sweet, so heavenly sweet! I chose thee Ease! and now for me No heart shall ever fondly swell No voice of rapturous harmony Awake the music-breathing shell Nor tongue of witching melody It's love in faltering accents tell Nor flushing cheek, nor languid eye Nor sportive smile nor artless sigh Confess affection all as well. No snowy bosom's fall and rise Shall e'er again enchant my eyes No dewy lips profuse of bliss Shall ever greet me with a kiss Nor sweet low tone pour in mine ear The trifles Love delights to hear: But living loveless, hopeless, I, Unmourned and unloved must die. I chose thee Ease! and yet to me Coy and ungrateful thou hast proved, Though I have sacrificed for thee Much that was worthy to be loved. But come again, and I will yet Thy past ingratitude forget: O come again! thy witching powers Shall charm my solitary hours. With thee to cheer me heavenly queen, And conscience clear, and health serene, And friends and books to banish spleen, My life should be, as it has been, A sweet variety of joys: And Glory's crown and Beauty's smile, And treasured hoards, should seem the while The idlest of all human toys. BELPHEGOR The Subject from Macchiavelli In the great council hall of Hell There once was held a consultation, The subject wasâ'tis strange to tellâ How to encourage population. 'Twas long agoâI can't tell whenâ But ere they heard thy name, Gastronomy, And Malthus had not taught them then The true political economy. Causing less talk and discontent Than Panama's debated mission An Envoy to the Earth was sent Belphegor got the new commission. A devil of partsâand not without wit Handsome and graceful as Apollo And then in salary and outfit He beat all other envoys hollow. With grave enquiries charged, he came, To Earthâa Duke, or some such matterâ And when the women heard his fame Wives, widows, maids, began to flatter. One vixen dame whose charms and art Might make the devil himself light-headed, First caught his eye and then his heart 'Till they in short were fairly wedded. But now began Belphegor's woes His spouse's tongue forever wagging Gave the poor devil no repose Still teasingâscoldingânever flagging. He ran at lastâwho would not run To scape such matrimonial cooing Through every clime beneath the sun With his Eurydice pursuing. At length one day almost o'ertaken He heard her voiceâhe knew it wellâ And with a dreadful panic shaken He scampered off direct for Hell. Arrived at Court he told his story âLearn Sire,â he said, âfrom my miscarriage To fill your realm and raise your glory You've but on Earth to favor marriage.â DIALOGUE Written in Mrs. I?'s Album beneath the figure of Cupid sharpening arrows Fortune. Cupid! you rogue, what sharpening darts! Pray are they tipped with Gold or Lead? Cupid. How can you ask? You know men's hearts I aim at them and not the head! SONNET FROM THE PORTUGUESE OF CAMOENS âCycnis qui non sine causÃ¢ Apollini dicati sint ... cum cantu et voluptate moriantur.â Cic. Tuscul. Quaest. Lib I They say the swan, though mute his whole life long, Pours forth sweet melody when life is flying, Making the desert plaintive with his song Wond'rous and sad and sweetest still while dying. Is it for Life and Pleasure lost, he's sighing? Grieving to lose, what none can e'er prolong:â O! no, he hails it's close, on death relying As an escape from violence and wrong. And thus, dear Lady! I at length perceiving The fatal end of my unhappy madness, In thy oft-broken faith no more believing Welcome despair's sole comforter with gladness, And mourning one so fair is so deceiving, Pour out my soul in notes of Love and Sadness! EPIGRAM FROM THE ITALIAN OF DE ROSSI âHow very soon your roses die!â Said Love to Flora with a sneer: âTrueâ was the blushing nymph's reply âAnd yours, do they last all the year?â [No wonder if thy pulses thrill] No wonder if thy pulses thrill To harmony almost divine And yet it caught with all its skill An eloquence much less than thine. Yes! when the witching syren sung Her unpremeditated song 'Twas but thy hearts dear native tongue Which thou hast pined to hear so long. Thy soul was as a living lute Tuned to the music of the spheres Untouched before it's chords were mute But now it echoes all it hears. Thou hast not heard indeed on earth Sounds that so flashed through all thy frame But thou hast known them ere thy birth Even in that Heaven from whence they came. And when again the angel choirs (Late may it be and I at rest) Receive thee home from kindred lyres Congenial sounds shall hail thee blest! [It was a just reproof! ... and yet I thought] It was a just reproof! ... and yet I thought But no! ... Shall I deserve reproach again? No by the Gods! ... My nature overwrought Has yet enough of Pride to hide its pain! I have borne much in silence onceâand now Shall I at last play woman with my tongue? No! ... I will shew so smooth, so calm a brow That none shall dream how sore my heart is wrung. Even thou thyself shalt deem my feigning trueâ A smileâa hollow laughâa bitter jest Would but betray me to the vulgar view, Thy garb Indifference! becomes me best! Gay with the gay, and solemn with the wise Dull with the ploddingâsportive with the fairâ Thou shalt distrust my love or doubt thine eyes To mark how perfectly my mask I wear! The hand that would not perish in the flame If the heart bade it, is unworthy thineâ The mind that shrinks from any pang but shame Would well deserve thy utmost scorn and mine. There is no sterner task of soul to teach!â No matter!âIt is taughtâThe silent spell Closes upon my murmursâlookâactâspeech Shall all obey thee!âWellâperhaps too well! LINES WRITTEN IN AN ALBUM Of Human Life from youth to age This Book an apt sad emblem seems; Hope promises to fill each page With Friendship, Love or Pleasure's dreams. Time wears apaceâbut day by day, Hope's promises are all forgot Some flowers are scattered by the way But here's a blankâand there's a blot. At length they fillârevolving years Add their memorials, sad, or kind, But some are sullied by our tears, And some have left a stain behind! And when in after times we turn Our Memory or our pages o'er 'Tis but too oft alas! to mourn O'er all we knewâand know no more! The hand that traced those lines is oldâ The spirit that flashed here has fledâ And these recall warm heartsânow coldâ The changedâthe absentâor the dead. Then why should we embalm the past Since the fond record only tells That Love and Hope and Life at last Are broken charms and baffled spells? I do not know. ... They say that Eve Some flowers of Eden chose to keep O'er all she prized and left to grieve, O'er all she loved and lost to weep! [Happy is he who sees thee smile] Beatus qui te videt est Beatior qui te audiet Qui te basiat semideus est Qui te potitur est deus. Buchanan Happy is he who sees thee smile, Still happier he who hears thee speak, He half a God who dares awhile Breathing fond vows to flush thy cheek. Thy hand to pressâthy lip to touchâ O thou hast ne'er such favors givenâ 'Twere bliss too much for man too much For all except a saint of Heaven! To clasp thy form and hear thee sighâ To feel and call thee all his own Ah! that were happiness too high For any but a God alone! [Choose as thou wilt! the landâthe main] Choose as thou wilt! the landâthe main The court, the camp, the mart, the grove, Power, Glory, Pleasure, Wisdom, Gain, Rank, Friendship, Wit, Fame, Beauty, Loveâ Choose as thou wilt! since all may choose, And win thy choiceâall may be won. Their fortune none but fools accuse Who know not how her frowns to shun. Choose as thou wilt!âbut know whate'er Thy choice may beâor thy success All are but bubbles of the air Deceitful forms of happiness! Clouds that have ta'en a heavenly form And heavenly hues and heavenly charms, All that a mortal heart can warmâ All that escapes from mortal arms! [I have deceived myself! ... the dream was sweet] I have deceived myself! ... the dream was sweet And bitter the awakingâLet me call My spirit up, it's destiny to meet Triumph may hail, but shall not mock my fall! Conquered, but not subduedâI scorn to yield Betrayed, but yet unmovedâwith steady eye I gaze in silence on my last lost field, With neither wish to live nor fear to die. From my proud hopes of high dominion hurled My transient reign of Love and Glory o'er DethronedâExiledâfrom what I thought my world, The Empire of the Heart exists no more! What then is left? to bend beneath the shock Tire Heaven with prayers and be of Hell the jest? No! welcome first the vulture and the rock! Prometheus-like in this, as in the rest. I strove with Heaven for Heavenâthe strife was vainâ The fire I stole consumes meâlet it burn!â No tyrant shall wring pleasure from my pain Scorn yields such wrong it's only just return! [My hair is grayâthe flower of life is past] Jam mihi deterior canis adspergitur aetas, Jamque meos vultus ruga senilis arat: Jam vigor, et quasso languent in corpore vives; Nec juveni lusus qui placuere, placent. Nec, si me subito videas agnoscere possis: Aetabis facta est tanta ruina meae. Confiteor facere haec annos: sed et altera caussa est, Anxietas animi, continuus que labor. Ovid Epis. My hair is grayâthe flower of life is past Time flies and Death approaches. In the wave My setting sun is sinking overcast, Hope is no more, and Peace is in the grave! Long years of passionâgrief and care have done Their workâand left their records on my brow, My lamp is almost outâmy race is runâ Let the scene close!âIt matters little now. The best and worst are pastâthere lingers yet But a faint pulse in these poor shrunken veins, The world and I are even, and the debt That all must pay is all that still remains. Would it were paid!âI tire of my roadâ 'Tis hard to live unblessing and unblestâ Forgetting and forgotâI bear a load Too far above my strength and fain would rest! [My Sister! through how many trying scenes] My Sister! through how many trying scenes We two have past in long long years gone by, Even yet though half a life time intervenes I cannot think of them without a sigh. Since thine unconscious infant lips were prest First by a brother's boyish, bashful kiss, 'Till now when he, life-weary longs for rest, And even thy hopes seek better worlds than this: What has been done and sufferedâfelt and thought In this long, dismal, dark abyss of life, Where troubled spirits toil on, overwrought, Amid temptation, sorrow, sin and strife. How many of the loved and mourned have gone How many joys and hopes of youth have fledâ How few of all the friends who linger on Replace the lostâthe changedâthe coldâthe dead. Yet Hope is left! ... One hopeâthe bestâthe lastâ Though we plod on o'er thorns unto the grave However long the day, to comeâor pastâ Our Sun at length will sleep beneath the wave. Forever? ... No! ... The Ave's evening chime The Ave Maria della sera common in Catholic countries. The thought was suggested by the well known lines of Dante: âEra giÃ  l'ora che volge'l disio A'naviganti, e intenerisce il cuore Lo di c'han detto a dolci amici addio; E che lo nuovo peregrin d'amore Punge se ode squilla di lontana Che paia 'l giorno pianger, che si muore.â â'Twas now the hour when seamen's fancies dwell On Homeâand in the traveller's heart arise Sad thoughts of the dear friends he bade farewell: And Love's fresh-parted pilgrim starts and sighs Heart-stricken by the distant vesper bell Which seems as if it mourned the day that dies!â That strikes the traveller's ear as day-light dies Although it seems to mourn departed Time Tells too of Life Eternal in the skies! RUTH âAnd Ruth said, entreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee; for whither thou goest I will go; and where thou lodgest I will lodge: thy people shall be my people and thy God my God. Where thou diest I will die and there also will I be buried.â Nay do not ask!âentreat notâno! O! no I will not leave thy side: Whither thou goest, I will go, Where thou abidest, I'll abide. Through lifeâin deathâmy soul to thine Shall cleave as fond as first it claveâ Thy Home, thy people, shall be mine Thy God, my Godâthy grave my grave! [If it be love, in every pulse's tide] If it be love, in every pulse's tide To feel a secret pure devoted flame And with feign'd smiles unceasing torture hide Deep in the soulâmy passion has a name! If it be love, to live but in one thought, To breathe but for anotherâweal or woe Only to feel when from another caught This, this is Love! ... I feared it must be so! If it be Love, to worship night and day One objectâOn a fond heart's faithful shrine All our life's hopes and fears and joys to lay In silent sacrificeâsuch love is mine. If it be love, our being to consume In unknown, fruitless, uncomplaining tears, And wish in bitterness an early tomb Then I have cherished hopeless love for years! [This life is but a horrid dream] This life is but a horrid dream To those who squander it like me, In wild excess and mad extreme, Mock joy and sad festivity! Rather than wake to laugh and rave, Or toss in such distempered sleep, I would that I were in my grave, So there were none my fate to weep! Yet I who wither and repine Am envied by a glittering throng, And there are hearts wrapped up in mine By ties too sacred far for song. Intense in all thingsâLove or Griefâ RageâPrideâJoyâHatred or Disdain, O! not to feel were some relief From this vicissitude of pain! Yet I endure and shrink notâI Have done with Hope and Joy and Fear, The torrent of my heart is dry, My burning eyes have not a tear. Come Genius! see thy torments! come!â View Fate, the tortures of thy slave! But mark ye! his despair is dumb Your power he yet can scorn and brave! THE HERON A Fable from the French of La Fontaine Along a glassy river's edge Well stocked with fish and fringed with sedge A long-legged Heron strayed: The day was fine the water clear The Pike and Carp, now thereânow hereâ A thousand frolics played. The largest trouts came close to shore As if to tempt our bird the more But he, unlucky wight, Eyes them askance and steps aside Through laziness perhaps, or pride, To wait for appetite. A stated regimen he kept At certain hours eat drank and slept As learned quacks prescribe Full soon his appetite returns With eager haste he strides and burns To thin the finny tribe. Advancing in his former post The nobler prey he found was lost Some tenches still remained But these like Flaccus' city rat Expecting better cheer than that He haughtily disdained. âAnd shall I then on tenches dine? What Heron of such parts as mine E'er stooped to swallow these?â The tench refused in mighty dudgeon He passes on, and a lone gudgeon Is the next fish he sees. A gudgeon truly eh! cries he Lord what a pretty mess for me! As sure as I'm a sinner, Before I'd ope for him my bill I'd wait (which God forbid!) until Tomorrow for my dinner. Yet for far less wide gaped that bill Since travelling farther onward still His legs begin to fail No fish however small appears Starvation much he shrewdly fears And gladly eats a snail. Let us not be too hard to please They are most wise who take with ease What Fate to give thinks fit. What's near your due then ne'er refuse Seeking too much we often lose And many thus are bit. To Herons 'twere in vain to preach Listen Mankind, 'tis you I teach From you my tales I draw: A belle who like most belles you find Was pretty vainâseemed half inclined In Hymen's yoke to draw. But he whose suit she grants must be Polite, young, handsome, well made free Not jealous, nor yet cold Of fortune, wit, and birth possest, Alas! not one man so much blest We in an age behold. Some lovers of importance came, Urged by her friends to choose, the dame All offers thus repels; âNow pray don't name such fools to me You surely rave!ââHere reader see A specimen of belles! One witty was, but unrefined, Another's nose awry inclined 'Twas that thing, or 'twas this, 'Twas every thingâfor belles discover A thousand faults in every lover Whom they would fain dismiss. Some decent matches offered then Among the middle class of men But she was pleased to jeer: These folks perhaps think I'm afraid To lie aloneâor die a maid But I have no such fear. My slumbers (God be praised!) are sound No inconvenience I have foundâ I miss not love's embrace: Still to these notions she adhered Age came her gallants disappeared Chagrin crept on apace. A year or two in trouble past She felt her beauty fading fast And every fatal day Saw that some charm of face or air Or formâwhich art could ne'er repair Escaped with time away. Her mirror plainly said make haste And wed for you've no time to waste:â No longer vain or cold, She took the hint, right glad to patch With a mean wretch a sordid match Though ugly cross and old. NAPOLEON'S GRAVE Faint and sad was the moon-beam's smile, Sullen the moan of the dying wave, Hoarse the wind in St. Helen's isle, As I stood by the side of Napoleon's grave. And is it here that the Hero lies, Whose name has shaken the Earth with dread? And is this all that the earth supplies, A stone his pillowâthe turf his bed? Is such the moral of human life? Are these the limits of Glory's reign? Have oceans of blood and an age of strife, And a thousand battles been all in vain? Is nothing left of his victories now But legions brokenâa sword in rust, A crown that cumbers a dotard's brow, A name and a requiemâdust to dust! Of all the chieftains whose thrones he reared Was there none that kindness or faith could bind? Of all the monarchs whose crowns he spared Had none one spark of his Roman mind? Did Prussia cast no repentant glance Did Austria shed no remorseful tear When England's faith, and thine honor France, And thy friendship Russia, were blasted here? No!âHoly Leagues like the heathen Heaven Ungodlike shrunk from the giant's shock And glorious Titan, the unforgiven, Was doomed to his vulture and chains and rock. And who were the gods that decreed thy doom? A German Caesarâa Prussian Sageâ The Dandy Prince of a counting-room And a Russian Greek of Earth's darkest age. Men called thee despot, and called thee true, But the laurel was earned that bound thy brow And of all who wore it alas! how few Were freer from treason and guilt than thou. Shame to thee Gaul! and thy faithless horde, Where was the oath which thy soldiers swore? Fraud still lurks in the gownâbut the sword Was never so false to its trust before. Where was thy veteran's boast that day âThe old guard dies, but it never yields!â O! for one heart like the brave Dessaix One phalanx like those of thine early fields! But no no, no!âit was Freedom's charm Gave them the courage of more than men You broke the magic that nerv'd each arm Though you were invincible only then. Yet St Jean was a deep, not a deadly blow, One struggle and France all her faults repairsâ But the mild Fayette and the stern Carnot Are dupes and ruin thy fate and theirs! [Go! go, thou art false!âthy tears thy smiles] Go! go, thou art false!âthy tears thy smiles Thy sainted look, thy solemn vow Thy thrilling tones, thy lovely wiles, All all thy charms are worthless now! 'Twas not because thy lips were sweet As violets bathed in heavenly dew, I loved their melting kiss to meet No! 'twas because I thought them true. Nor did I prize the trembling light That in thy glances warmly shone, O no! when I believed them bright I thought they burned for me alone. When thy heart changed it broke the best The dearest, purest, strongest, spell, 'Tis easy now to burst the rest How easyâthou thyself canst tell! [Why is it then, the Earth and Sky] Why is it then, the Earth and Sky, The promise of returning Spring, And all that greets the ear and eye To this worn soul no joy can bring? Has Life consumed itself?âO no! It is not thatâits currents run No more apartâthey only flow Silent, intense, and deep in one. Its source is hereâwhat shores it laves, Or whither rolls the impetuous tide, Who knows?âWho knows what kindred waves Claim tribute from its hope its pride? But O! until they meet again (Alas! how could they ever part?) What chanceâwhat change can calm the brain What timeâwhat thought can soothe the heart? The Future?âWill not Hope deceive? The Present?âO! it must not last! And yet alas! how vain to grieve Over the unreturning past! [A sister's kissâan infant's prayerâ] A sister's kissâan infant's prayerâ A parent's loveâa vestal's vowâ The Evening Starâthe morning airâ Are not more pure than thou: I dare not love theeâbut my eyes Have told thee whom they idolize. I held and still I hold thee dear, Of more than mortal worth, A spirit of another sphere Too good and fair for earth: And I would blush to wound thine ear With aught that Angels might not hear! But since our pious zeal is faint My church must be forgiven, If it allows at least a saint, To help us on to heaven: Thou art my saint!âin every prayer I always see thee smiling there! TO [?] An unknown fair one designated to me only as the sixteenth letter. Lady! the brother of my heart demands A hymn of praise to offer at thy shrine But that which were Devotion at his hands, Becomes mere blind Idolatry in mine: For unrevealed to me by word or sign, The fair Divinity I worship stands, Around a shadow my fond faith I twine Like to the Gentile of far times and lands. They to a being whom they deemed divine âThe Unknown Godââ a sacred temple raised, And praised his nameless name, as I do thine, Unknowing who, or what it was they praisedâ Merely like me to murmur and repine, That all in vain altar and incense blazed! [A Rose between two Heartsâby moonlight given] A Rose between two Heartsâby moonlight given! What may so bright an augury forebode? Type of the opening Spring and Star-lit Heaven On Grief's gray twilight all in vain bestowed! Aye! all in vain alas!âthe smiling Spring And the calm lustre of the starry skies Nor Joy nor Hope nor Peace to Him can bringâ They're but as lovely scenes to sightless eyes! The givers and the gift can but recall The fading forms of long departed years Visions of bliss all vanishedâlostâall, all! And ev'n their memory half-effaced by tears. Aye! that same flower!âits hueâits scent have brought Back on my soul a thousand nameless things A long long train of melancholy thought And maddening passion's fierce and fiery stings. Such was the gift! ... Down busy devil!âdown! Consume this soul in secretâif you mustâ But though it's pangs no revelry can drown, Feast like the worm that revels on the dust! In darkness and in silence feast! ... No more!â Such thoughts should have no tongueâwithin their tomb Let them bleed on, but without running o'er No eye should mark and shudder at their gloom. So, to our theme again!âthat it may fling Oblivion o'er a spirit wrung and riven,â Farewell! sweet emblem of the blooming Spring Farewell! calm type of the blue starry Heaven! On Roses, woman's words, and moon-lighted nights, Unnumbered, soft, sad tender memories dwell Heart-treasured thoughtsâunspeakable delightsâ And all I may not utterâFare ye well! ['Tis the hour when Twilight stealing] 'Tis the hour when Twilight stealing O'er the Earth and Sea and skies Wakes a high and holy feeling, And fond thoughts of Home arise: Love's fresh-parted Pilgrim sighing, Starts to hear the vesper bell, Breathing to the day-light dying One last wildâsweetâsad farewell! Imitated from Dante's âEra giÃ  I'ora.â In this hour still and solemn O'er a shrine in fragments laid Memory on a broken column Marks the ruin Time has made: Wellâtoo well alas! recalling Hopes and Joys forever fled. ... O! what burning tears are falling For the lovedâthe changedâthe dead! BARCAROLA Imitated from the Italian My Gondola's waiting dearest! The night is well nigh to it's noon, And the sea is the calmest and clearest Ever lit by a summer's moon: O! come like a white cloud flying O'er the heavenly blue of the skies And the ripple that murmurs in dying Will seem but to echo our sighs! O come to my Gondolaâdearest! And sail with me side by side I know there are times when thou fearest To trust either meâor the tide: Yet a mother her infant sleeper Or the moon-beams this dreaming sea Regard with a love no deeper Or purer than mine for thee! [Zoe farewell!âHow much is in that word] Zoe farewell!âHow much is in that word Deep, solemn, chill and sad as Memory's knell Recalling Joy departedâHope deferredâ Fond dreamsâdear thoughtsâkind looksâlost friendsâFarewell! Farewell! ... We have not known each other long Nor muchâBut what of that?âHow soon and well Fate binds by ties invisible yet strong All that love those we love, to us. ... Farewell! Since first we met some few but fatal years Upon my life and brow have left their spell Love-SorrowâPrideâRageâHateâDespair and Tears Have writ their burning annals thereâFarewell! Farewell! among my few unclouded hours Are those I owe unto your voice and shell When with bright smiles, sweet words, and tuneful powers, You chased my evil spirit. ... Fare ye well! TO A LOVELY BRUNETTE WHOM THE AUTHOR SAW AT HER LATTICE O! darkly fair!âyet beautifully bright, I know not how to call thee, sweet unknown! Whether a Tropic Day or Arctic Night Or the soft Twilight of a temperate Zone. Although I have but seen thee from afar, And haply never may behold thee near, Let me adore thee as a lovely star, Altho' my words may never reach thine ear! No hopeless ship-wrecked mariner could watch Through dim, death-glazing eyes for morning's ray, More eagerly, than I have striv'n to catch That movement of thy lattice, once a day! Nor always once!âday after day has past And be it pride, or bashfulness, or scorn, Thy well-named Jealousie is closed as fast, As though it had been of the monster born! Did'st thou observe me? Hence is thy disdain? Ah! pardon I entreat, my wandering eyes! They sought with fond Astrology to gain Some hint from Destiny's high star-lit skies! Alas! oershadowed by a cloudy veil The skies disclose their oracles no more, And even the beacon, I was wont to hail, The taper in thy window gleams no more! Darkling I tempt my solitary fate Full of heart throbbing wishes, doubts and fears, As thou may'st be a widowâmaidâor mate So must my vision endâin bliss or tears! And yetâif maiden, I should never winâ If widow, both would be too wise to marryâ If wife, twere worseâto love thee were a sinâ And I have quite as much as I can carry! [Why should her misery o'er my own prevail] Why should her misery o'er my own prevail? Hence horrid shadows! from my brain depart! ... It may not be!âthe melancholy tale Rings in my ear, and weighs upon my heart! I cannot rest!âI knew there were such woes But thought them singular, and did not deem, That such again would break on my repose With all the tortures of a troubled dream. Lovely and innocent and good and kind Young, sensitive, yet wise from early grief, A faultless body and a spotless mind Supremely wretched!â'Tis beyond belief! But truth and that which seems so are not one And spite of all that wisdom said of old There still are mysteries beneath the sun All the hearts secrets have not yet been told! I may not tell them! ... There are wounds that bleed And must bleed inwardly, while there is breath Yet thou may'st bear them Mary, for indeed Others have borne them and will bear 'till death! But come what will!âworn out with grief and care Whether you totter onâor cast them down You have one fellow sufferer in Despair One friend to cheer thee though the World should frown! [You call me sad!âyou errâI'm gay] You call me sad!âyou errâI'm gay Who hath yet mark'd my spirits sink Who hath beheld by night or day My lip, voice, eye, or visage shrink? My looks? ... Joy wrinkles just like care Go trace the marks that Pleasure brings You'll find them in the face and air Of Charles, merriest of kings. Charles the IIâa sad dog as his face shews. You err!âyou err!âI sad?âyou dream Sorrow ne'er touched a heart like mine WitâBeautyâLove are still my theme And crown'd with Music, Flowers and Wine! Boy bring the cup, the vase, the lyre Awake, awake the soul of song! Let odours, sound, sight, taste inspire The pleasures that to sense belong. What shall they say with ills opprest Unto their yoke I bowed my neck? When scaffolds echo to a jest, âTill even the scaffold echoes with the jest.â Rogers. And laughter rises from the wreck: What hearts from living bosoms torn Have bled with greater pangs than mine? What ships on Ocean's bosom borne Held hopes like those all wrecked on thine? Yet the dark Indian's self-control As soon shall leave him at the stake As this stern, sullen, stubborn soul Shall ever bow or bend or break. No, no! all, all shall deem me gay The sound of revelry and mirth Shall grossly cheat these souls of clay Who deem me of their kindred earth. Bring, bring the cup, the vase, the lyre! Wake Pleasure's maddening syren song! Mask! quickly mask, that cursed fire, The torches of the Fury throng! The song! the Dance! away! away! Rouse Mirth 'till all Night's echoes start! Who now shall say I am not gay? Who shall pretend to read my heart? TO ? ... Farewell! and if forever ...âstill farewell!â Howe'er it fare with meâI would not leave One word, one thought, at which thy veins might swell Thy temples throbâor even thy bosom heave. Farewell!âDespite experienceâprudenceâprideâ My Destiny o'ertakes me once again; I strove to shun the blowâor turn asideâ Yet I endure, and shrink not from the pain! Farewell! farewell!âThine be the peace I lose, Mine be the grief I would not have thee shareâ With Thee be all it was thy choice to chooseâ With me the pangs I cannot choose but bear. Farewell! Thou wilt forget meâbe it so! 'Twere better farâI could not bear to dwell In cold remembranceâevery other woe To that were nothing!âNow farewell! farewell! [Yes! let us part, while yet we may] Yes! let us part, while yet we may, Ere wishes wild and warm begin, Or Love will lead our souls astray And we may wander into sin. Where then would be thy spirits light, Thy manners innocently gay? The peaceful slumbers of the night, The tranquil pleasures of the day? And where would be the steady beams That Virtue lends thine eyes of flame? And where the blush that never gleams To warn us of the bosom's shame? O! they would fly, forever fly To seek some purer holier shrine; But not to light a brighter eye, Or warm a lovelier cheek than thine! What then were left?âa hectic blaze The beacon-fire of vicious guile, An anxious lookâan eager gazeâ A feverish sighâa languid smile! Thus thou would'st lose, in beauty's prime, The purity that won my heart, And I should live to curse the crime That taught thee every wanton's art. Or oh! if less ensnared by ill, Thy soul should mourn its lost repose, Should weep our faultâyet love it still, That were the keenestâworst of woes! For could I bear to hear thee sigh And know thy sighs were caused by me, Or see thee weep, and feel that I Had wrung those bitter tears from thee? Think'st thou, that I could witness this, Nor give thee tear for tear again? ... And is one moments guilty bliss Worth a whole Life of fruitless pain? And yet one hour ... one little hour, In Love's esteem far far outweighs The richest gift in Virtue's power Heaven's sweetest softest note of praise! And thou wilt hate me, if we part, And turn my counsel all to jest, Scorning the cold and languid heart That mightâand did not dareâbe blest! Then Dearest stay!âone moment yetâ Turn, turn, those fatal eyes away And let me, if I can forget, The light that leads my soul astray! The flame that burns so brightly now Like other flames may yet decay; The heart that broke a former vow O! will it not again betray? Then shun, O! shun, the wild'ring fire Beneath whose dangerous light we range Seek milder beams that ne'er expire And calmer hearts that never change! They'll love thee with so pure a love With such a holy, heavenly zeal, As sainted souls in Heaven above For other saints on earth might feel! Will that suffice?âWhat no reply Nay then my pious rhetorick faintsâ Thou know'st my heartâI read thine eyeâ Alas! we were not made for saints! [Oh! dearer by far than the land of our birth] Oh! dearer by far than the land of our birth Is the land where the hours of our infancy flew And the dearest and loveliest spot upon earth Is the spot where our loves and affections first grew. What home can we have but the home of the heart What country but that of our friends can we claim Or where is the powerful spell that can part The soul from the scenes of it's hopes and it's fame? Then tell us no more we were born far away Where Liberty's star never rose or has set We were nursed where it shines and have caught from it's ray A warmth which our bosoms can never forget! And dearer by far than the land of our birth Is the land where the hours of our infancy flew And the dearest and loveliest spot upon earth Is the spot where our loves and affections first grew! [Forget me not! or grave or gay] Forget me not! or grave or gay Joyous or sad whate'er thy lot Whether to sigh, or smile, or pray, Forget me not! forget me not! Forget me not! O! no no no! I could not bear to be forgot Whate'er I amâwhere'er I go Forget me not! forget me not! Forget me not!âthe world of me May say and deemâI care not whatâ I ask but one fond thought from thee Forget me not! forget me not! Forget me not! by night or day Whate'er deceit may subtly plot To lead thy heart from mine astray Forget me not! forget me not! Forget me not! O let no spell Remembrance from thy bosom blot By every tone of voice and shell Forget me not! forget me not! Forget me not! my dust, my fame May all in ... cold obstruction rot ... Soâthou wilt but preserve my name Forget me not! forget me not! NIGHT REVERIES O! let no skeptic's reasoning zeal Awake me from my dream of bliss! There isâthere isâI knowâI feelâ There must be other Worlds than this! What are their joys or why conferr'd Or howâI will not stop to scan Nor ask if any heavenly word Revealed their mysteries to Man. I need but look on those bright orbs Which shine so calmly from above, That single look my soul absorbs In reveries of hope and love! I look, and as they roll and blaze My soul claims kindred with the skies And they persuade me as I gaze There's that in me, which never dies! It is divine to think that Earth, And earthly thoughts are cold and dim Compared with those of Heavenly birth Which lift the enraptured heart to Him! For here, from youth to age we still For some pure pleasure thirst and pine, Our greatest good is mixed with ill, Ev'n Love is only half divine. Either it is our cruel fate To see our young affections crostâ Or find a mutual heart too late, Only to know how much we've lost: To languish many a dangerous hour Reading each other's glance and sighâ To tremble in Temptation's power Yet neither dare to sin nor fly. Or else in broken hearted grief O'er our first cherished passion bend 'Till Death shall come to our relief The wretches true and only friend! Or worseâwhen all is wonâto find Perfection's dream dissolve awayâ The charm was only in our mind Our idol but a thing of clay. In cold indifference or disgust, To drag a goading chain along, And false ourselves,âin falsehood trustâ An interchange of wrong for wrongâ Or when the grave has set its seal Upon the heart we wronged and wrung, To find Remorse has clutch'd his steel, And Conscience found at last her tongue! [In utter loneliness of heart] In utter loneliness of heart Mid well-known scenes and looks I roam As I were a thing apart A being without friend or home. Alone in peopled solitude, I gaze unconsciously aroundâ Alas! this seeming vacant mood, But marks remembrance too profound. Yet here my boyhood rolled away, And here too in maturer years, Successive passions held their sway, Through agonies of blood and tears. I have outlived them all!âand now Though inwardly the bosom bleed A purer heartâa calmer browâ A more untroubled mind succeed. [Good-Night! good night!âthose few kind words are all] Good-Night! good night!âthose few kind words are all That mark our partings now. ... It was not so In times gone byâWhy cannot I recall Those days with all their bliss and all their woe? Unmarkedâunhidden then, our hopes our fears, Were freely interchanged alone for hours; We hid not from each other smiles or tears But the heart's sunshine mingled with its showers! Now frosty welcomes usher in the morn, And formal partings close the lingering day Beneath the World's keen glance like bondsmen born We toil through hateful tasks, as best we may. I murmur not! ... I know thy lofty soul Spurns like my own this yokeâthis servile chain, No! the World's minions let the World control, We only fear to give each other pain! Good Night! good night then! ... on thy gentle lids Light sweet repose, and as thou sink'st to rest Dream it is heâthy friendâthy brother bids Good-night!âand whispers[, âBe] thy slumbers blest!â ON POWER'S IDEAL HEAD OF ROGERS' GENEVRA Each word, each thoughtâeach single drop of ink That lips or pens of master-minds let fall Becomes a germâto make new millions think: So said the noble bard Lord Byronânor is this allâ Not only from the vasty deep they call Spirits that comeâembodied in new forms But these again at pleasure we recall Helped by each art that into being warms The mind's creations.âShakespeare's stricken deer Mid Cowper's holiestâMoore's most tender themes, In Proteus beauty charms the heart and ear: âI was a stricken deer that left the herdâ Cowper âCome rest in this bosom, my own stricken deerâ Moore And poor Genevra's innocence which gleams In Rogers' verse even through her fearful bier In Power's marble now immortal beams! [In this dull world of books and men] In this dull world of books and men Where scarcely anything's worth heeding And not much more than one in ten Of men or books deserves a reading 'Tis rapture now and then to find A face or page, so rare in spiritâ So full of graceâso rich in mind That it bears heaven's own seal of merit. And if such page be given to song The heart feels all its beauties nearer. And if such lovely face belong To womanâO! how much 'tis dearer! Yet when alas! we've conned it o'er And seen how many charms surround it, How do we wish we'd found before, Or if not then, had never found it! [Farewell! my more than father land] Sey mir gesegnet Hier in der ferne Liebliche heimath! Sey mir gesegnet Land meiner TrÃ¤ume Kries meiner Lieben Sey mir gegrÃ¼sst! KÃ¶rner Farewell! my more than father land, Home of my heart and friends adieu! Lingering beside some foreign strand How oft shall I remember you: How often o'er the waters blue Send back a sigh to those I leave, The loving and beloved few Who grieve for meâfor whom I grieve. We part!âno matter how we partâ There are some thoughts we utter not, Deep treasured in our inmost hearts Never revealed and ne'er forgotâ Why murmur at the common lot? We part!âI speak not of the pain But when shall I each lovely spot And each loved face behold again? It must be monthsâit may be yearsâ It mayâbut no! I will not fill Fond hearts with gloom, fond eyes with tears Curious to shape uncertain ill: Though humble, few and far, yet still Those hearts and eyes are ever dear Their's is the love no Time can chill The truth no chance or change can sear! All I have seenâand all I see Only endears them more and more, Friends coolâhopes fadeâand honors flee Affection lives when all is o'er: Farewell my more than native shore I do not seek or hope to find Roam where I will what I deplore To leave with them and thee behind! [Lady farewell! ... bear with thee o'er the wave] Lady farewell! ... bear with thee o'er the wave Back to the scenes we lov'd in early youth, My wishes, hopesâaye pray'rsâif aught so grave From one so frivolous may seem like truth! Farewell! ... Thou wilt forget both them and me Before thy vessel cleaves the foaming mainâ But of the briefâbright moments passed with thee I shall a deep remembrance long retain! [In sad constrained and tedious hours] In sad constrained and tedious hours Time lingers onâand day by day Soulâbodyâhopesâaffectionsâpowers Sink by a slow but sure decay! And this is life! ... a living death, Whose loss I well might count a gain, Since it is but unwilling breath, And sensibility to pain! So be it! ... In a few short years The burning brain's last throb is o'er, And the heart's ashes quench'd in tears Emit their caustic fire no more! So let it be! ... in silent gloom I see and I abide my fate! ...

LINES WRITTEN IN LADY ?'S ALBUM We all have treasures which we fondly cherish Precious and rare memorials of the past, Relics of days that do not wholly perish At least as long as Life and Memory last. The antiquary hoards his coin and gem Medal and manuscript and ancient tome: And jewelled Krees [Kreese]âchibouque with curious stemâ Or fishâor bird the Mariner brings home. The artist, and enthusiast of art, Have sketches gather'd wheresoe'er they've been And Nature's musing votaries do not part Without mementos of each favorite scene. The traveller brings from each enchanted spot Something that may recall it to his view, A leaf from Virgil's tombâEgeria's grotâ Fragments of Romeâa flower from Waterloo. After his pilgrimage the Palmer keeps The garb, and staff, and cockle-shell he bore, After her Lover's death the maiden weeps Over the ring he gave, or tress he wore. Thus is it ever!âIn the heart's affections In FriendshipâLove and Memory we live Life's strongest spells are wishesârecollectionsâ Joys we have gained or giv'nâor hope to give! But in the Museums of the Soul like this, The calmly meditative mind may see The inborn thirst of past and present bliss, All we have beenâand yet expect to be. Lady! may thy collection long increase! Rich with the spoils of each succeeding year, Proofs of the heart's contentâthe bosom's peaceâ HopeâLove and Joy, unsullied by a tear. [They say no Love's so deepâso pure] They say no Love's so deepâso pure, As that where Death has set his seal âThere is no passion so full of soft[,] tender and hallowing associations as the Love which is stamped by Death!â Bulwer It is not so!âat least I'm sure Death could not add to what I feel!

So all that Death for Love can do Is rend the Veil that dims his sight Clear from the brow its pensive hue And on his smile pour endless light! [Cease, cease thy song! it tells me much] Cease, cease thy song! it tells me much Of those whom this sad heart held dear, 'Tis heavenly sweet!âbut ah! not such As thou should'st breathe or I must hear. There was a time!âbut no 'twere vainâ 'Twere folly to confess it allâ Thou must not breathe those notes again I cannot bear what they recall!

Come! come to us hither! the goblet is flowing, And Wit dropping sparks like the sun-shine in showers And warm hearts have met, and bright glances are glowing, The moon's shining softly, the summer breeze blowing And odours and melody round us are throwing Their spell, 'till our souls seem all music and flowers! O come to us hither! the moments are flying, The longest of lives has not many such hours; The goblet is sinkingâthe South wind is sighingâ The moon-beams are waningâthe night flowers dyingâ O come to us hither! we'll take no denying Your pleasure is all that's now wanting to ours! [Here all is heartless, hollow, loud] Here all is heartless, hollow, loud Vain glittering shew and empty sound: Society's a lonesome crowd, Pleasure, the same dull tedious round. One heart to loveâone life to pressâ One friend to trustâin some wild glen Were less a waste, O! ten times less, Than this vast solitude of men. TO ? who lent me Taylor's Physical Theory of a future life after reading it Were each letter a page and a book every line Half my thoughts on this sheet I might hope to convey But 'till angels shall teach us the shorthand divine In limits so narrow what is there to say? If soul unto soul (with some slight corporeity) Could impart by mere contact, as Taylor proposes, A soul-full of meaning in all the variety Of heart thrilling bliss which in Heaven he supposes How many sweet dialogues then might I hold With you dear little spirit, both nightly &amp; daily, When no thought would have time on the lips to grow cold But by pressure, from heart, pass to heart, bright &amp; gaily! What exquisite things we should say by a touch! By impression ex-pressions quintessence revealing, Our re-formed existence-informed overmuch And language exchanged for communion of feeling. To my notion such things might have been had the Lord So pleased it, or else, if with due veneration, Alphonso the Wise had but put in a word In behalf of us all, at the hour of creation. This King is reported to have said that if God had consulted him about making the World he could have given some good advice. The learned dispute whether this was said theologically or merely as an astronomer. The Jesuit father AndrÃ¨s in his admirable history of Literature warmly defends the monarch from the charge of impiety: of course it can't be impious to quote him. V. Storia d'agri Letteratura You shall hear why I venture to say so, because I abhor every quibbling and cavilling objection, And the very amendment proposed to the laws ... Grows out of themselves, by an easy deflection. For example on earth you no doubt have seen eyes, Speaking volumes on volumes to all but a dunce, And perhaps have heard utter'd in two or three sighs, The whole of Love's Encyclopedia at once. From a small hand's soft pressure, so slight as to seem Mere hazard of Friendship, I know there has sprung Whole years full of thought, 'twixt a doubt &amp; a dream Too subtle by far for the pen or the tongue. So there wanted in truth, but a single link more, Such as Mesmer half guessed atâa magical ring Like the one that from Solomon Chrystalline bore By which soul to meet soul over worlds could take wing. The Ring of Solomon is mentioned in the Arabian nights entertainments, &amp; the Lady also, as well as her extraordinary manner of acquiring such tokens: but as it is no where saidânot even in the Quatre Facardins,âthat she got one from the wise monarch the author must have drawn on the fables of the Talmud or his own fancy for this scandal on the good King. Had we such electro-magnetic attraction In the sweet sphere of Venus so lovely &amp; bright Whose air is made up of Caprice &amp; Distraction This line is unintelligible unless what the Italians sometimes call a âcapriccioâ and the French a âdistractionâ is intended.

TO JULIA More than three lustres since the sportive scroll Retraced fair Julia now at thy command, Avouched the honest homage of a soul That held thee sovereign of its fairy land. Since then the summer-days of life have flown And years like ages seared my heart and brow, Yet underneath their ashes still is strewn More of the past than words shall e'er avow. All hopes, all thoughts, save of a few fond days Hallowed by innocence, by friendship cheered, Whose sole memorials are those careless laysâ All else have perishedâeven the most endeared. These too ere long must perish!âbe it so: Love, Friendship, Hope, Ambition, all have fledâ Then why should Memory linger?âTo bestow Flowers on the falseâthe changed, the lost, the dead?

Der Taubstumme redet in Geberden, Liebende mit den Augen, der Kutscher mit der Putsche, der true Hund mit dem wedelnden Schanze, erhabne Menschen nur mit Handlungen, GemÃ¼ther mit GesichtszÃ¼gen, die Zeit mit GlockenschlÃ¤gen, der Zeitgeist mit DruckerschwÃ¤rze, und SprichmÃ¶rtern, Dichter, Weltweise und KÃ¼nstler in Gleichnissen, Bildern und Gestalten, Engel in Lichtstrahlen und KlÃ¤ngen, und Gott redet in der Weltgeschichte.

Of life and empire, sword and crown Historians, bards, and fame bereft, Of Egypt's monarch's high renown What but a hieroglyph is left? Where now were Hector's deeds of arms Ulysses craftâAchilles' ireâ Where lovely Helen's fatal charms, But for the breath of Homer's lyre? Pious Aeneas, where wert thou With all thy toils by land and wave, But for the wreath that crowns thy brow Which Virgil's verse immortal gave? Where, where were each Ausonian chief Whose tones through Dante's trumpet tell Their name and story, bold and brief, To Purgatory, Heaven and Hell? Geoffry the braveâthe wiseâthe justâ With all his Holy Wars might rot The Knight in dust, his sword in rust If Tasso had not changed his lot. A timely or untimely word Decides the fate of men and things On tempests borneâin thunders heardâ The Oracle of Realms and Kings! âAvoid delays!âââThe Die is Cast!â From Curio's and from Caesar's tongue As fell each phrase, a simoom's blast Its blight o'er Roman freedom flung. When Mirabeau's tremendous bolt âGo slave, and tell thy master!â fell, In tones that startled knave and dolt, What millions might have heard their knell? And Heâthe Man of Fateâthe Starâ Lord of the Iron Soul and Crown, Was not his word once peace or war Like Jove's or Destiny's his frown? A word then shapes the fate of Man Makes or unmakes the greatâthe wiseâ Even with a Word the world began And at a word the dead shall rise! Tell me not then, that âWords are air,â Of all things mortal they can claim The highest and the noblest share, The share of Heaven from whence they came. For words are not in sounds alone Or letters framed by Hermes' art Nature has voices of her own Their tongue the Seaâthe Starsâthe Heart. And to the souls of those whose soul The Universe's spirit hears There is a language in the whole Beyond the Music of the Spheres. And he who holds its key can read Far into the abyss of Time Beyond the reach of craft or creed To monsters of the Earth's first slime. And higher than the realms of day, To stars with systems still unknown, Track to lone worlds, each wandering ray, Long ages ere it reached our own. Aye, and record for humbler skill The triumph, and the fact attained, That deeper depthsâheights higher still, Truth upon truth, shall yet be gained. Then do not say that âWords are air,â Spirits they are, of mortal birth, Wing'd messengers of Man that bear To God the voices of the Earth! And who can say that even at length Mankindâthe living and the deadâ The Heartâthe Soulâtheir weaknessâstrengthâ Hopes fears and mysteries may be read? What I of others, on such page, Or they of me, might now be told 'Twere vain to askâanother age Must pass, before such leaves unfold. Yet ere I dieâunseenâunheard, Fain would I, one dark leaf explore, Construe one lineâtranslate one wordâ Or guess it's meaning, if no more. And for such knowledge, good or ill, I fear me much, were Eden mine, Spite of the pastâthe Serpent's skill Its joys might tempt me to resign.

GEMMA DONATI He loves me not!âno! he has never loved me! Yet men have called me fair, and women frown'd, Curling their lip with well affected scorn, Or subtler still, join'd in their gallants praise, With earnest admiration sweetly pale, Lauding my greatest faults. He loves me not, And yet I am well-bornâDonati's daughter Has little need to envy rank in Florence, Nor can the proudest Alighieri deem Their Dante matched beneath his gentle blood. I did not come unportioned to his bed, Though that were nothing: gold he prizes not, Ev'n his worst foes, in all their bitterest strife, Have failed to soil his glory with that stain. But what avails it all? He loves me not, Altho' I am the mother of his children, Have loved, and love, and must forever love him, Spite of his coldness, and our houses' discord, These civil broilsâthe poverty and exile He will not let me share, and last and worst, The cherished passion of his early youth, That has survived them all, and even the grave! Thrice happy Beatrice!âdying youngâ Beloved of Danteâin his heart embalmed, And by his prose and verse to after years, Perhaps to other ages handed down! Would I were with thee gentle Portinari! Or thou wert here, and free to share his love, Who neither can return nor conquer mine! But let me perish first!âI could not bear To witness all his tenderness for Thee. And yet thy soul can ne'er have known for him The passionate devotion felt by mine. Had Dante loved me, think'st thou all the world Would e'er have won or forced me from his arms? No, never! never!âfar too like his own, In Nature's sternest mould my heart was cast; O'er ruined hopes, with silent grief and rage, In violent desperate calmâto brood and break, May be its destinyâbut not to change! Yes! they may call me proud and harsh and stern, And gossips hint 'twas Dante's shrewish wife Taught him Philosophyâof such I reck notâ But none have known, and none will ever know How deep a love abided in my bosom, How keen the pang to find it unreturned. Heaven knows, that often when to them I seemed Sullen or froward all my soul was tasked, Far, far beyond its strength, to hide my tears. Their blame I could endure but not their pity Nor even hisâand therefore have I hid, In my shut breast, it's self-consuming care, Rather than loving, seem unloved, or scorned. O! who can tell how my whole being shook Convulsively as if the living clay, Like the inanimate Earth, could quake and shudder, As the Volcano bids with trembling agony;â O! who can tell how more than lava flames Burned in my brain when I was first aware That Dante loved me not, and I was doomed To share his bed, a stranger to his heart? Tormenting doubts reluctantly admitted Strange phantom shapesâdream horrid and obscure, Suspicionsâhideous shadows of the Truth Haunted me long and rose almost to phrenzy Till the bolt fell, and crushed me, to a calm! Strange fits of absence, reverie and gloom Hung o'er his spirit often from the first, Nor had I power to chase the cloud away: He loved not question in these moods of mind, If sportively I chid him, he repelled My fondness gravelyâLevity displeased him, Silence and sorrow tacitly reproved. The lion and the eagle in his blood Made him impatient of the least restraint And even watchful tenderness annoyed him. At times indeed, he half-rebuked himself, And craved my pardon for his waywardness, Pleaded his studiesâand the state of Florenceâ Forese's deathâand Guido's banishment, Or else my kinsman Corso's fiery temper Pride and vindictiveness, and civil feuds. But yet some words half uttered in his sleepâ A name too well pronouncedâtho' in a sigh Sufficed to tell these were not all his griefs. He used to sit and watch Arnolfo's labors As if St. Reparata's wondrous pile Wrapt him in contemplationâbut the vault Where Beatrice's relics lay was there And Portinari's palace full in view. When our accursed factions in their war With fierce, blind, cruel, undiscerning fury Condemned my Alighieri in his absence, And when our house to pillage &amp; the flames Was given, and I strove to save what he With jealous care had ever held most precious The treasures of his mindâthe hallowed page To which he poured out all his secret soul, O! what a pang it was to find HER there The load-star of his verseâhis themeâhis Muse! Since then my life has been one long disease On which Death only can bestow a cure. My Gabriello! were it not for thee And Jacopo, Pietro, and thy sister, Called by her nameâI knew not wherefore then, I had not lingered in the world thus long To pine in hopeless widowhood of heart, And leave behind a blighted memory! STAR OF MY LOVE! I Il y a parmi ces Ã©toiles un amour eternel qui peut seul suffire Ã  l'immensitÃ© de nos voeux. De Stael Star of my Love! how brightly burns Thy mild, pure, tranquil flame, tonight, Though thousands from their chrystal urns Are pouring floods of silver light, In thine alone I take delight, For one who in my absence mourns Gazes upon thee in thy flight And every look I give returns And therefore dost thou seem so bright Star of my Love! Star of my Love! while thus on high The heavenly host their vigils keep Careering through the dark blue sky, And earth seems sunk in slumbers deep, There yet are those who do not sleep But gaze upon thee with a sigh, And eyes that long, yet scorn to weep, While gloomy clouds across thee fly Like thoughts that o'er our fancies sweep Star of my Love! Star of my Love! I see thee shine Even now as when thou met'st the gaze Of one, whose hand was clasped in mine When last we saw thy glories blaze: Then as we marked thy beauteous rays With spirits soft and pure as thine We asked thine aid in thorny ways And bowed our hearts before thy shrine With souls all gratitude and praise Star of my Love! STAR OF MY LOVE II Stern der Liebe! ... der freundlichste der Sterne KÃ¶rner Star of my Love! I hail again Thy light on Nights calm, dark, blue, stream, An absence grief and care and pain Are as a half forgotten dream: For she is here whose glances seem To purify the earth from stain And lend a more celestial beam To Heaven and all it's glorious trainâ O how our souls with rapture teem! Star of my Love! Star of my Love! the holiest shrine On which fond hearts were ever laid Thou art, thou must be all divine, And thou hast heard the vows I made, When with heart-broken grief I prayed Benignant Star, one favoring sign, O! thou hast not denied thine aid And Heaven has heard my prayers and thine: Thus then to Thee my thanks are paid Star of my Love! Star of my Love! most lovely star Of all in heaven's high temple hung! Though wandering now asunder far Thou hast for us an angel's tongue Thou saw'st the parting pang that wrung Our bosoms from thy silvery car For us thy golden Lyre was strung To Him that made us what we areâ And thus to thee our hymn we sung Star of my Love! STAR OF MY LOVE III Stern meines Lebens, Schmacht' ich vergebens Nach deinem Licht? Du zeigst dich nicht! Stern, willst du dich nicht zeigen? KÃ¶rner Star of my Love! unmarked of late, Again on thee my eyes I bend Celestial messenger of Fate What thoughts on thy bright path attend! Evil or Good dost thou portend? Pleasure or Pain? or Love or Hate? Alas! how fondly do we blend Our Earthly with thy heavenly state What hopes what fears to thee ascend Star of my Love! Star of my Love! I gaze on thee As though upon thy sparkling brow I saw what thou alone canst see The look of Her, who even now Recalls the sad and solemn vow Long since breathed forâthough not to me, I need not utter when or how. ... Thou didst receive it silentlyâ As thus to Thee my heart I bow Star of my Love! STAR OF MY LOVE IV Dum loquor, et flemus; coelo nitidissimus alto Stella gravis nobis, Lucifer ortus erat. Ovid Trist. Star of my Love! most faithless star That e'er on mortal misery shone! Years passâand still thy votaries are Apartâself-exiledâsadâaloneâ And can it be our woes are known To Heaven, and we still doomed to feel Pangs which though seraphs breasts were stone Might stroke upon their hearts like steel, Star of my Love! Star of my Love! my years decline, My spirits sink, my hopes decay, In moody wretchedness I pine And perish slowly day by day, Ages of pain have rolled away Since first with mingled love and awe I gazed upon thy silver ray Murmuring at Fate's resistless law Star of my Love! Star of my Love! I ask no more Omen or sign or aid from thee: Cast up a wreck, beside the shore Of dark despair's cold calm dead sea, All that has beenâall that shall beâ Are now unchangeably the same: Blasted by one accurst decree Sic Hope,âLove,âJoy,âAmbition,âFameâ Star of my Love! Star of my Love! I've proved thy power, It has no strength to help or save! Star of my Love! I wait the hour When God shall claim the breath he gave: I cannot be denied a graveâ And this is all I hope or ask He whose kind hand redeems the slave Will end at length my weary task Star of my Love! STAR OF MY LOVE V 'S war ein Stern! Jetzt ist er zwar versunken KÃ¶rner Star of my Love! upon the deep Struggling through Night's dim misty veil Whilst low winds o'er the waters creep Still heaving from the by-gone gale, And solitary sea-birds wailâ Though all below are sunk in sleepâ Beneath the lazy flapping sail, My lonely midnight watch I keep, Thy holy light once more to hail Star of my Love! Star of my Love! too well!âtoo well!â Those sights and sounds past years recall! O'er Memory's deep with sullen swell As troubled passions rise and fall Though Mystery in her sable pall Shrouds the dark caverns where they dwell, What shadesâwhat voices hear her call And come obedient to her spell! Alas! for themâfor Herâfor all! Star of my Love! Star of my Love! since that marked hour Worn ever on my heart and brow, Which gave thee o'er my thoughts the power No orb in Heaven can claim but thou, Through every chance and change 'till now When Fate's most dismal shadows lower, And to Despair my spirits bow Blessings or curses may'st thou shower As I have kept, or broke my vow, Star of my Love! Star of my Love! with grief and pain I've numbered many an hour of years O'er days that never come again Outpouring all my soul in tears: Consuming life in doubts and fears And wearing out my heart and brain And now what hope my bosom cheers What soothes me for my long borne chain? Who loves me now or marks or hears? Star of my Love! Star of my Love! I did not deem For me this hour could e'er arrive! Star of my Love! my cherished dream Is gone, and I am yet alive! Why is it that I still survive? Suspended o'er the ocean stream I need but loose my hold to drive My thoughts forever from this theme! ... And yet, to see her once I strive Star of my Love! TO MISS ? Fair daughter of the West! whose cloudless skies And gorgeous suns I may no more behold, How have they tinged thy ringlets and thine eyes Celestial azure hung with molten gold! Likeness to things of more than mortal birth We traceânot merely in thy charms aloneâ An emanation thou from Heaven to Earth, The wandering spirit of some starry zone. So purely, sweetly, innocently bright, Embodied Hope &amp; Joy, and Peace &amp; Love, Seeming to others as the Day to Night Or to this wretched world the realms above. So wise, so good, so fair, so kind, so just, Thou beam'st an Angel on this vale of tears And I bow down before thee in the dust Stained with the pilgrimage of long long years. O! I am sick of Earth and all its harms Its care, pain, woe, fear, hate, strife, guilt &amp; shame, Come! spread thy wings then, clasp me in thine arms And bear me to the skies from whence ye came! 5 Jany 1838 [Why is that gaze? Canst thou not tell] Why is that gaze? Canst thou not tellâ Is it not written on my browâ By whomâon whom was wrought this spell? Art thou not conscious whenâand how? Other Poems ON MY BIRTHDAY Another of my wasted years has gone And brought me nearerânothing but the grave And thus they wax and wane; and one by one Leaveâas they found meâMelancholy's slave. Each stamps it's wrinkles deeper on my brow Each sheds it's frost upon my scattered hair And those who knew me once, and see me now Speak of me as among âthe things that were.â I've watched thro' night 'till dawnâthe lingering sun It is my Fortieth Sunâat length appears! And seems to question me[:] âWhat hast thou done Thro' this long waste of miserable years?â Ere his Eighth lustre gallant Surrey died But dying left behind a deathless name. And hast thou then no honorable pride? No noble aspirations after fame? Horace &amp; Virgil Scipio Caesar lit With Glory ere thy years their sword or page, And even while thou livedst Napoleon Byron writ Their brief and burning annals on the age âAnd thouââEnough!âI know it allâ'tis true! Wasting my head and heart on love and rhyme While the irrevocable moments flew. ... I perish and bequeath no name to Time. SONNET SENT TO CARLO BOTTA ON READING HIS HISTORY OF ITALY Botta! the Muse of History with thy pen Sheds beauty, light, and wisdom on her pages, Reviving thus, even in our days again, Part of the Roman, Greek and Tuscan sages; Their love of freedom, and their skill in menâ Hatred of force and fraudâthe lore of agesâ With style's best virtue gracedâmost lovely when Truth scorns both Demagogue's and Tyrant's wages. There is a fascination in thy story Beyond mere music from a Syren's tongue, As though exulting in her ancient glory Above the tale entranced, Ausonia hung, Demanding back from Time now faint and hoary, Days worthy of the land where Dante sung! [Daughter of Grecian Genius! from whose soul] Daughter of Grecian Genius! from whose soul PureâEnglishâwomanly high thought and feeling Their heart-sprung Poetry's rich treasures roll Ev'n critic taste and reason's wonder stealing, As hurrying tow'rd impassion'd meaning's goal, Expression under Fancy's torrent reeling, Thy spirit seems to burst from Earth's control Its Heav'n-born Myths in music's breath revealing! How sweet, how bright, how lovely, how sublime, Majestic and exhaustless is the stream, Pour'd forth by Nature, thus enrich'd by Time, Shaming the golden tides that poets dreamâ The ever-glorious Sea of deathless rhyme Wherein [sun], sky, and stars reflected gleam! Anonymous (Italian) âQui giace un Cardinale.â Here lies a cardinal far famed For doing works of good and evil; He did his bad work very well, But spoiled his good work like the devil. Juan MelÃ©ndez ValdÃ©s ANACREONTIC I applied myself to science, To be free from care and strife, Thinking Wisdom bade defiance To all the ills of life Alas! what silly fancies! I could not nurse them long; Give me music back, and dances, Love, friendship, wine, and song! Has life so few vexations, That we increase our store? Or so many recreations, We need not wish for more? Fill the cup! let's drain a measure To my own Dorilla's eyes; Till Wisdom teaches pleasure, 'Tis no pleasure to be wise. What heed I if the sun Be a fixed star or no? What time the planets run Their course, why need I know? Is the moon peopled, land and flood? What millions may be there? They never did us harm or goodâ About them need we care? Away with each historian! And the chiefs whose deeds they tell; Roman or Macedonianâ What matter where they fell? While our sportive lambs may wander In this green valley free, What's Caesar, Alexanderâ King or Khan, to you and me? The land protects our foldâ I speak the word with awe; If it's safe, need I be told Of the âwisdom of the lawâ? The men who study, suffer Trouble, and toil, and care; Each mid-night taper-snuffer Has a sad and solemn air. What gains the sallow student? To doubt his studies tend; Doubt makes new studies prudentâ In doubts new studies end. So passes life away In jealousy and strife, Disputing night and dayâ O enviable life! Bring wine! my girl, bring wine! With Love, and Song, and Jest, While there are eyes like thine, A fig for all the rest! LINES WRITTEN BY THOMAS CHATTERTON WHILE MEDITATING SUICIDE IN THE AUTUMN OF 1770 I love to see the fading leaf I joy to note the withering tree For cold neglect and scorn and grief Have wasted me. I love to hear the sullen wind, I love to watch the rising wave Beneath whose swell I soon shall find A peaceful grave! I love to see the surges beat Around this insulated rock That spurns them proudly from his feet Nor feels the shock Here will I watch the gathering storm And listen to the sea-birds cry 'Till night envelopes every form From mortal eye Then shall my spirit take it's flight To that unknown mysterious shore Where thousands every day alight But quit no more. Forgive me heaven! if rash the dead I cannot beg; I dare not steal: Even man's obdurate heart might bleed At what I feel. Would I could pray! ... it is too late, Despair has stiffened every limb! .... Pray for me father! ... mercy's gate Is free to him. Bend haughty soul! unbent before Bow to thy maker stubborn knee! 'Tis done! the last great trial's o'er Angels of mercy pray for me! LINES FOR THE MUSIC OF WEBER'S LAST WALTZ See! the Sun is sinking Day is closing fast Twilight's pensive-thinking Hours will soon be past: Love's first Pilgrim sighing Starts to hear the bell Which to day-light dying Tolls a last farewell: Vesper's hymn is stealing O'er the charmed air Every form is kneeling Every sound is prayer. Thus 'mid all that's dearest Would I sink to rest Like that bright Star nearest To the drooping West: Let not Love bewail me, 'Twould but wound my ear When my senses fail me Be thou only near; While my eyes are glazing Take thy hand in mine And be sure while gazing Life's last thought is thine! ON THE DEATH OF A YOUNG LADY Soft and sweet be thy deathly sleep Bright and glad be thy heavenly waking O do not dream that thou seest us weep Feel not thou, that our hearts are breaking! Ne'er oh ne'er mayst thou hear us sigh Known to thee may our griefs be never But if thou look'st from the starry sky Think that thou seest us happy as ever. And we, when we press the holy ground That covers thy grave at the hour of even Will fancy thy Spirit is hovering round And smiling points to it's native heaven. Full oft when the moon of night is near And our wearied eye lids have sunk in slumber We'll dream that thy golden lyre we hear Softly touched to its sweetest number. And oh! we'll deem when our bosoms thrill With the pulse of joy or the pang of sorrow Our good thou sharestâbut not our ill And Patience or bliss from the thought we'll borrow And at last, when the hour of death is near Around our couch thy Spirit shall hover To whisper Hope in our dying ear And waft us to peace when life is over. ON GREENOUGH'S WASHINGTON Such was the Man!âSimpleâAustereâsublimeâ By every fortune triedâin all unmovedâ HeroâSageâPatriotâgreat without a crime Who conquered freedom for the land he loved:â And for himselfâtook nothingâbut a Name That None 'till thenâ&amp; no one since has won: Does not the very marble speak his name? Who dare thus point to Heaven but WASHINGTON[?] Guido Guinicelli (Italian) When steel and lodestone touch they cleave As if in rapturous trance they hung, Severedâeach others clasp they leave As though to life and love they clung. Thus too the heart!âbut ah beware! When over the subtle flame has past Both must its power forever share And each, to each, be firstâand lastâ Absent or present, heart and steel Become as if by lightning riven: Thenceforth they only know and feel One spell on Earthâone Star in Heaven! [Whilst busy Memory fondly strays] Whilst busy Memory fondly strays O'er griefs and joys of other times And many a much loved form pourtrays And many a beauteous scene displays Of former years and distant climes. The burning blush will sometimes rise For youths first wild romantic schemes Which now, when Time hath made me wise Appear if viewed by Reasons eyes But idle and fantastic dreams. For I have sought the silent wood And many a live long summer day Wrapt in enthusiastic mood Supremely wise divinely good Within it's deepest covert lay. There formed vain schemes of happiness For life's gay morn or cloudless even, Encouraged worth relieved distress Heard every tongue my virtues bless And smiled mid a domestic heaven! But tho' these follies flush my cheek Whene'er the past is called to view Yet stillâ(I dare my thoughts to speak) Though knaves or fools should call me weak I mourn them false yet love them too! This honest truth I tell full free, Whatâif the heartless crowd condemn? Let not that steal one sigh from thee They only strive to laugh at me, While I, sincerely pity them!</field>
