      <field name="fulltext">THE ARAB WARRIOR. FROM THE ARABIC. Go, ask of men that know my name, And they the truth will speak, That I'm the terror of the strong, The helper of the weak. My spear has made the dragon brood Succumb to galling bands, And tossed before the jaws of War The forage he demands. I steer my horse through stormy fights, As a seaman steers his craft; My joy, to splinter on my breast The foeman's flying shaft. I am the latest laid to rest, The earliest in the fight, And while the others idly feast I rub my harness bright. And while the booty they divide I heap the ranks of slain, And when they scorn my poverty, I scorn their greed of gain. ARAB PRAYER. âLa illah il' Allah!â the muezzin's call Comes from the minaret, slim and tall, That looks o'er the distant city's wall. âLa illah il' Allah!â the Faithful heed, With God and the Prophet this hour to plead: Whose ear is open to hear their need. The sun is sunken; no vapor mars The path of his going with dusky bars. The silent Desert awaits the stars. I bend the knee and I stretch the hand, I strike my forehead upon the sand, And I pray aloud, that He understand. Not for my father, for he is dead; Not in my wandering brothers' steadâ For myself alone I bow the head. God is Great, and God is Just: He knoweth the hearts of the children of dustâ He is the Helper; in Him I trust. My sword is keen and my arm is strong With the sense of unforgotten wrong, And the hate that waits and watches long. God, let me wait for year on year, But let the hour at last appear, When Vengeance makes my honor clear. Once let me strike till he is slain; His blood will cleanse my sabre's stain, And I shall stand erect again. Till then, I wander to and fro, Wide as the desert whirlwinds go, And seek, by the sun and stars, my foe. Better than Stamboul's courts of gold, Whose harems the Georgian girls infold, Whiter than snow, but not so cold; Better than Baghdad's garden bowers, Or fountains that play among Persian flowers; Better than all delights and powers, The deed God's justice will abideâ The stern atonement, long denied, That righteous Vengeance gives to Pride. ODE TO INDOLENCE. I. Find me a bower, in silent dells embayed, And trebly guarded from each wind that blows, Where the blue noon o'erroofs the tranquil shade, And poppies breathe an odor of repose; Where never noises from the distant world Disturb the happy calm of soul and sense, But in thy haven every sail is furled, Divinest Indolence! There shall I summon all melodious measures, And feel the hymns to thee, I sing to other Pleasures. II. Within thy realm the vexing tempests die That strip the leaves from Life's aspiring tree, And fairer blossoms open in thy sky, To richer fruits maturing peacefully. What is the clangor of Ambition's car To thine eternal silence? To thy rest, What are the stormy joys that shake the breast, And Passion's cloud, that leaves the thunder-scar? On brows that burn with Toil's relentless fever Thy pitying hand is laid, and they have calm forever. III. Where thou dost sit, the shadow of Despair Fell never; Hate and Envy thence depart; Turn from thy gate the baffled hounds of Care, And the great strength of slumber fills the heart. Even Love himself, far exiled, in thy bower, From the bright paths of rapture which he trod, Folds up his wing: in Indian Song, the god Was born beneath the sleepy lotus-flower. The only fugitive escaped the riot, His presence glorifies thy charmed elysian quiet. IV. Far from thee drift the shattered hulks of life; But the wrecked spirit slumbers at thy feet, And, harbored now from every wave of strife, Feels the strong pulses of Existence beat. There hears the heart its native language, free From the world's clamor; with enlightened eyes There doth the soul its features recognize, And read its destiny! The dark enigmas which perplexed the sense Fade in the wisdom, born of Indolence. V. Yea, let men struggle, toil, exult, and win The pigmy triumphs which they fret to wear; But I will fly the curse of primal sin, And in thy lap the peace of Eden share. Serener than a star on Twilight's breast, A sea-flower, deep below the tropic waves, Or sparry foliage of the dÃ¦dal caves, My life shall blossom in thine arms of rest. My breath grows calm; my weary eyelids close; And the pursuing Fates have left me to repose. THE BIRTH OF THE HORSE. FROM THE ARABIC. The South Wind blows from Paradiseâ A wind of fire and force; And yet his proudest merit is That he begat the Horse. When Allah's breath created first The noble Arab steed,â The conqueror of all his race In courage and in speed,â To the South Wind He spake: From thee A creature shall have birth, To be the bearer of my arms And my renown on Earth. The pride of all the Faithful, heâ The terror of their foes: Rider and Horse shall comrades be In battle and repose. Then to the perfect Horse He spake: Fortune to thee I bring; Fortune, as long as rolls the Earth, Shall to thy forelock cling. Without a pinion winged thou art, And fleetest with thy load; Bridled art thou without a rein, And spurred without a goad. Men shall bestride thee who have made Their fame, their service, mine; And, when they pray upon their way, Their prayers shall count as thine. The worship which thy master speaks Thou sharest silently; By mutual fate he rises up, Or falls to Earth with thee. THE ANGEL OF PATIENCE. âPatience is the key of Content.ââ Mahomet. To cheer, to help us, children of the dust, More than one angel has Our Father given; But one alone is faithful to her trustâ The best, the brightest exile out of Heaven. Her ways are not the ways of pleasantness; Her paths are not the lightsome paths of joy, She walks with wrongs that cannot find redress, And dwells in mansions Time and Death destroy. She waits until her stern precursor, Care, Has lodged on foreheads, open as the morn, To plough his deep, besieging trenches thereâ The signs of struggles which the heart has borne. But when the first cloud darkens in our sky, And face to face with Life we stand alone, Silent and swift, behold! she draweth nigh, And mutely makes our sufferings her own. Though with its bitterness the heart runs o'er, No words the sweetness of her lips divide; But when the eye looks up for light once more, She turns the cloud and shows its golden side. Unto rebellious souls, that, mad with Fate, To question God's eternal justice dare, She points above with looks that whisper, âWaitâ What seems confusion here is wisdom there.â To the vain challenges of doubt we send, No answering comfort doth she minister; Her face looks ever forward to the end, And we, who see it not, are led by her. She doth not chide, nor in reproachful guise The griefs we cherish rudely thrust apart; But in the light of her immortal eyes Revives the manly courage of the heart. Daughter of God! who walkest with us here, Who mak'st our every tribulation thine, Such light hast thou in Earth's dim atmosphere, How must thy seat in Heaven exalted shine! How fair thy presence by those living streams Where Sin and Sorrow from their troubling cease! Where on thy brow the crown of amaranth gleams, And in thy hand the golden key of Peace! MIMOSA BLOOMS. I breathe your perfume, blessed flowers; And looking out, the blue waves o'er, From Cadiz and her snow-white towers, I see the Egyptian shore. Grateful as joy that comes again With solace sweeter than erewhile, Your balsam fills my heart, as then, Beside the palmy Nile. Your golden dust is on the sands Where yet my transient footprint lies; And in the heaven of brighter lands Your little stars arise. Ye fringe with down the thorny stems; Ye flood the year with balm and spice, More precious than the plant that gems The dells of Paradise. Pure as a sinless virgin's prayer, Sweet as a sleeping infant's breath, Ye mingle with the solemn air Of old Repose and Death. Ye bear the bliss of Spring to realms Where endless Summer rules the hours; Noon's fiery deluge ne'er o'erwhelms The morning of your flowers. Types of a Faith whose odors free Gently the stress of Life beguile, Long may ye bloom and breathe for me, Ye darlings of the Nile! THE SHEKH. FROM THE ARABIC. Not a single Star is twinkling Through the wilderness of cloud: On the mountain, In the darkness, Stands the Shekh, and prays aloud:â God, who kindlest aspiration, Kindlest hope the heart within,â God, who promisest Thy mercy, Wiping out the debt of sin,â God, protect me, in the darkness, When the awful thunders roll: Evil walks the world unsleeping, Evil sleeps within my soul. Keep my mind from every impulse Which from Thee may turn aside; Keep my heart from every passion By Thy breath unsanctified. God, preserve me from a spirit Which Thy knowledge cannot claim; From a knee that bendeth never In the worship of thy name; From a heart whose every feeling Is not wholly vowed to Thee; From an eye that, through its weeping, Thy compassion cannot see; From a prayer that goes not upward, In the darkness and the fear, From the soul's impassioned centre, Seeking access at Thy ear! When the might of Evil threatens, Throw Thy shelter over me: Let my spirit feel Thy presence, And my days be full of Thee! THE GOBLET. I. When Life his lusty course began, And first I felt myself a man, And Passion's unforeboded glowâ The thirst to feel, the will to knowâ Gave courage, vigor, fervor, truth, The glory of the heart of Youth, And each awaking pulse was fleet A livelier march of joy to beat, Presaging in its budding hour The ripening of the human flower, There came, on some divine intent, One whom the Lord of Life had sent, And from his lips of wisdom fell This fair and wondrous oracle:â II. Life's arching temple holds for thee Solution quick, and radiant key To many an early mystery; And thou art eager to pursue, Through many a dimly-lighted clew, The hopes that turn thy blood to fire, The phantoms of thy young desire: Yet not to reckless haste is poured The nectar of the generous lord, Nor mirth nor giddy riot jar The penetralia, high and far; But steady hope, and passion pure, And manly truth, the crown secure. III. Within that temple's secret heart, In mystic silence shrined apart, There is a goblet, on whose brim All raptures of Creation swim. No light that ever beamed in wine Can match the glory of its shine, Or lure with such a mighty art The tidal flow of every heart. But in its warm, bewildering blaze, An ever-shifting magic plays, And few who round the altar throng Shall find the sweets for which they long. Who, unto brutish life akin, Comes to the goblet dark with sin, And with a coarse hand grasps, for him The splendor of the gold grows dim, The gems are dirt, the liquor's flame A maddening beverage of shame, And into caverns shut from day The hot inebriate reels away. IV. For each shall give the draught he drains Its nectar pure, or poison stains; From out his heart the flavor flows That gives him fury, or repose: And some shall drink a tasteless wave, And some increase the thirst they lave; And others loathe as soon as taste, And others pour the tide to waste; And some evoke from out its deeps A torturing fiend that never sleepsâ For vain all arts to exorcise From the seared heart its haunting eyes. V. But he who burns with pure desire, With chastened love and sacred fire, With soul and being all a-glow Life's holiest mystery to know, Shall see the goblet flash and gleam As in the glory of a dream; And from its starry lip shall drink A bliss to lift him on the brink Of mighty rapture, joy intense, That far outlives its subsidence. The draught shall strike Life's narrow goal, And make an outlet for his soul, That down the ages, broad and far, Shall brighten like a rising star. In other forms his pulse shall beat, His spirit walk in other feet, And every generous hope and aim That spurred him on to honest fame, To other hearts give warmth and grace, And keep on earth his honored place, Become immortal in his race. REQUIEM IN THE SOUTH. Thou hast no charm to turn the edge of Sorrow, Bird of the mournful strain! From thee doth Love a love more fervent borrow, But Pain a sharper pain. Why sing so loud, the passion-dream recalling, That ceased in sudden gloom? Why sing from boughs, whose ripened bloom is falling Upon a maiden's tomb? There needs no prompter for the love, belonging To that sweet memory; The heart's wild outcry, not its perished longing, Demands a voice from thee. The blackness of a grief that will not soften Clings round me through the day, And to the grave that hides her, wandering often, I weep the nights away. In this fierce sorrow there is no partakerâ It seeks no healing balm: Yet, though my lamentations cannot wake her, The exhausted heart grows calm. Here, filled with sorrows of its own creation, The night-wind swells and dies; And, drooping in their dumb commiseration, The palms around me rise. Here, from the fury of my passion fleeing, The barriers slowly fret, Which dam the restless river of my being To stagnate in regret. And I may conquer this o'ermastering anguish, And find my peace again; The manly heart must sometime cease to languish, Ruled by the manly brain. And what is wax shall be as steel within me, And be my fortune then: All soft indulgence powerless to win me From the stern ways of men. And let them say: âHis heart is cold and cruel, He knows not love's desire:â I gave the essence of my life as fuel To one extinguished fire. JERUSALEM. Fair shines the moon, Jerusalem, Upon the hills that wore Thy glory once, their diadem Ere Judah's reign was o'er: The stars on hallowed Olivet And over Zion burn, But when shall rise thy splendor set? Thy majesty return? The peaceful shades that wrap thee now Thy desolation hide; The moonlit beauty of thy brow Restores thine ancient pride; Yet there, where Rome thy Temple rent, The dews of midnight wet The marble dome of Omar's tent, And Aksa's minaret. Thy strength, Jerusalem, is o'er, And broken are thy walls; The harp of Israel sounds no more In thy deserted halls: But where thy Kings and Prophets trod, Triumphant over Death Behold the living Soul of Godâ The Christ of Nazareth! The halo of his presence fills Thy courts, thy ways of men; His footsteps on thy holy hills Are beautiful as then; The prayer, whose bloody sweat betrayed His human agony, Still haunts the awful olive shade Of old Gethsemane. Woe unto thee, Jerusalem! Slayer of Prophets, thou, That in thy fury stonest them God sent, and sends thee now:â Where thou, O Christ! with anguish spent, Forgave thy foes, and died, Thy garments yet are daily rentâ Thy soul is crucified! They darken with the Christian name The light that from thee beamed, And by the hatred they proclaim Thy spirit is blasphemed; Unto thine ear the prayers they send Were fit for Belial's reign, And Moslem cimeters defend The temple they profane. Who shall rebuild Jerusalem?â Her scattered children bring From Earth's far ends, and gather them Beneath her sheltering wing? For Judah's sceptre broken lies, And from his kingly stem No new Messiah shall arise For lost Jerusalem! But let the wild ass on her hills Its foal unfrighted lead, And by the source of Kedron's rills The desert adder breed: For where the love of Christ has made Its mansion in the heart, He builds in pomp that will not fade Her heavenly counterpart. How long, O Christ, shall men obscure Thy holy charityâ How long the godless rites endure, Which they bestow on thee? Thou, in whose soul of tenderness The Father's mercy shone, Who came, the sons of men to bless By Truth and Love alone. The suns of eighteen hundred years Have seen thy reign expand, And Morning, on her pathway, hears Thy name in every land; But where thy sacred steps were sent The Father's will to bide, Thy garments yet are daily rentâ Thy soul is crucified! THE VOYAGE OF A DREAM. There is a cloud below the mountain peak, Moored in the pauses of the uncertain air. Its fleecy folds piled idly, self-involved, Fashion the semblance of a floating throne, Torn, in the clash of airy anarchy, From the halls of Thunder; haply, once surcharged With elemental fire and threatening deathâ Fit seat for the Destroying Gods!âbut now Of ivory all compact, and touched with gold And opal radiance on its sunny hem, As if a peaceful Angel steered it down From empyreal heights, with folded wing Slow sinking through the yielding deeps. A throne It seems, where disembodied Thought may sit, Unquestioned take the sceptre of the world, And, exercising power anticipant, Go forth to try his lordship. I accept The moment's offer, mount the seat sublime, And on the winds whose wings I feel no more, Because I move before them, boldly try The blue abyss whose measure no man knows. Straight down the mountain sinks; the mountain pines Send a last drowning murmur faintly up The ingulfing air, then stand in moveless calm, Like coral forests rooted on the floors Of Ocean. Plummeted with all her sins, The Earth, down-sliding through the limpid sea, Bears far below, the noises of her broilsâ The greeds, the struggles, the devouring cares, The endless agitationsâleaving free To the enfranchised spirit the still fields Of amplest ether. Speed, my wingÃ©d throne! Wherever Thought may pilot, stretch thy flight, Higher than eagle dares, above the peaks Of Himalayan snow, o'er seas and sands, Through tropic green, or where the eternal ice Stiffens around the forehead of the Pole! The World is mine; the secrets of her heart Lie at my feet; she cannot shut them out: And as she spins on her appointed round From daylight into dark, from dark to dawn, The mysteries of ages, problems which A hundred centuries have left unsolved, Give one by one their answers. Yonder burst From the hot heart of Africa the springs Of waters that have rocked Egyptian gods, When the great stream that leaped in thunder down From Primnis and Syene's barrier, bore The chaplets and the consecrated oil To his own godship poured:âBeyond those hills, Whose tops against the Indian Caucasus Uplift their snowy helms, behold the vast Wind-driven platforms, whence the earliest Men Went with the streams to greener pasture-fields, And boreâtheir only heritageâGod's name, The altars of his worship, and the truths Whose rude foundations underlie the piles Of states and sovereignties, upholding firm The masonry of Time: and whatsoe'er Of summer beauty in the virgin isles, Of lifeless grandeur in the emerald crags Of undissolving ice, was never yet By bold Adventure wrested from the keep Of savage Nature, gives its secret up, Helpless beneath the master-gaze of Thought, As that of God. Sweep downward, streams of air! And thou, my cloudy chariot, drop thy shade To roll, like dust, behind thy silent wheels, And draw round Earth the triumph of our march! See where, from zone to zone, the shadow movesâ A spot upon the Desert's golden glareâ A deeper blue on the far-stretching plains Of Ocean's foamy azureâpausing now To cloak with purple gloom the shoulders bare Of mighty mountains, or ingulfed and lost Deep in their folded chasms, or sailing slow On wide savannas, the elysian home Of flowery life, or quenching splendors vain That dance upon the gilded domes of men, And blind their eyes to the great light of Heaven. As in this rarer ether I surmount Life's numberless obstructions, and my gaze Takes in the whole expanded round of Earth, So, lifted o'er the narrow walks of Time, The weary years have dwindled to a point, And all their lessons compassed in the sphere Of one sole thought, as in the dew-drop lies The large orb of the morning sun. The yearsâ The ages, that from their accretion growâ The cyclic erasâshrink, and all the Past Lies round and clear beneath me, swallowing up In one grand circumspect the separate lives, The individual links whereby our hearts Walk slowly back the difficult paths of Time, Or climb some lesser eminence, to gain A forward look that dimly penetrates The nearest Future. Past and Future now Unite their worlds in equal counterpoise, And, effortless as dreams, the wisdom comes That reads the hidden issues of all life, The purpose of Creation. Mount no more, Thou flying cloud, but rather turn to dew And weep thyself upon the clover mends, And mix thy being with their honeyed bloom, Than float alone within the highest vault Of blue-cold ether, to dissolve alone Into the thin, unfriendly air. Come down! Come down! and let me quit this perilous height, This icy royalty of thought, to glide Nearer the homes of men, the embowered nests Of unaspiring, lowliest content, And joy, that from the beams of many hearts Gathers its radiant focus, like a star In the warm mists of Earth: nor yet enough To glide above, but drop me in the fields Or in the vales at evening, when from work Accomplished, rest the glowing limbs of Toil, And men have time to loveâand I will kiss The rugged cheek of Earth, with thankful tears For every throb of every human heart That welcomes me to share the general law, And bear the mutual burden. Man alone Creates Elysium for the soul of man. The ample Future, and the godlike reach Of new existence, are the prophecies Of humblest Love, and in the souls that love And are beloved the shining ether swims, Whereon exalted, we o'erlook the world, And Life, and Death, and every thing but Heaven. HYMN TO AIR. I. The mightiest thou, among the Powers of Earth, The viewless Agent of the unseen God, What immemorial era saw thy birth? What pathless fields of new Creation trod Thy noiseless feet? Where was thy dwelling-place In the blind realm of Chaos, ere the word Of Sovereign Order by the stars was heard, Or the young planet knew her Maker's face? No wrecks are hid in thine unfathomed sea; Thy crystal tablets no inscription bear; The awful Infinite is shrined in thee, Immeasurable Air! II. Thou art the Soul wherein the Earth renews The nobler life, that heals her primal scars; Thine is the mantle of all-glorious hues, Which makes her beautiful among the stars; Thine is the essence that informs her frame With manifold existence, thine the wing From gulfs of outer darkness sheltering, And from the Sun's uplifted sword of flame. She sleeps in thy protection, lives in thee; Thou mak'st the foreheads of her mountains smile; His heart to thine, the all-surrounding Sea Spreads thy blue drapery o'er his cradled isle. Thou art the breath of Nature, and the tongue Unto her dumb material being granted, And by thy voice her sorrowing psalms are chantedâ Her hymns of triumph sung! III. Thine azure fountains nourish all that lives; Forever drained, yet ever brimming o'er, Their billows in eternal freshness pour, And from her choicest treasury Nature gives A glad repayment of the debt she owes, Replenishing thy sources:âbalmy dews, That on thy breast their summer tears diffuse; Strength from the pine, and sweetness from the rose; The spice of gorgeous Ind, the scents that fill Ambrosial forests in the isles of palm; Leagues of perennial bloom on every hill; Lily and lotus in the water's calm; And where the torrent leaps to take thy wing, But dashes out its life in diamond spray, Or multitudinous waves of ocean fling Their briny strength along thy rapid wayâ Escapes some virtue which from thee they hold: And even the grosser exhalations, fed From Earth's decay, Time's crowded charnel-bed, Fused in thy vast alembic, turn to gold. IV. Man is thy nursling, universal Air! No kinder parent fosters him than thou: How soft thy fingers dally with his hair! How sweet their pressure on his fevered brow! In the dark lanes where squalid Misery dwells, Where the fresh glories of existence shun The childhood nurtured in the city's hells, And eyes that never saw the morning sun, Pale cheeks for thee are pining, heavy sighs Drawn from the depth of weary hearts, ariseâ The flower of Life is withered on its stem, And the black shade the loathsome walls enclose Day after day more drear and stifling grows, Till Heaven itself seems forfeited to them! What marvel, then, as from a fevered dream The dying wakes, to feel his forehead fanned By thy celestial freshness, he should deem The death-sweat dried beneath an angel's hand? That tokens of the violet-sprinkled sod, Breathed like a blessing o'er his closing eyes, Should promise him the peace of Paradiseâ The pardon of his God? V. What is the scenery of Earth to thine? Here all is fixed in everlasting shapes, But where the realms of gorgeous Cloudland shine, There stretch afar thy sun-illumined capes, Embaying reaches of the amber seas Of sunset, on whose tranquil bosom lie The happy islands of the upper sky, The halcyon shores of thine Atlantides. Anon the airy headlands change, and drift Into sublimer forms, that slowly heave Their toppling masses up the front of eve, Crag heaped on crag, with many a fiery rift, And hoary summits, throned beyond the reach Of Alp or Caucasus: again they change, And down the vast, interminable range Of towers and palaces, transcending each The workmanship of Fable-Land, we see The âcrystal hyalineâ of Heaven's own floorâ The radiance of the far Eternity Reflected on thy shore! VI. To the pure calm of thy cerulean deeps The jar of earth-born tumult cannot climb; There ancient Silence her dominion keeps, Beyond the narrow boundaries of Time. The taint of Sin, the vapors of the world, The smokes of godless altars, hang below, Staining thy marge, but not a cloud is curled Where those supernal tides of ether flow. What vistas ope from those serener plains! What dawning splendors touch thine azure towers! When some fair soul, whose path on Earth was ours The starry freedom of its wing regains, Shall it not linger for a moment there, One last divine regret to Earth returning,â One look, where Light ineffable is burning In Heaven's immortal Air! VII. Thine are the treasuries of Hail and Snow; Thy hand lets fall the Thunder's bolt of fire; And when from out thy seething caldrons blow The vapors of the whirlwind, spire on spire In terrible convolution wreathed and blent, The unimagined strength that lay concealed Within thy quiet bosom is revealed To the racked Earth and trembling firmament. And thou dost hold, awaiting God's decree, The keys of all destruction:âin that hour When the Almighty Wrath shall loose thy power, Before thy breath shall disappear the sea, To ashes turn the mountain's mighty frame, And as the seven-fold fervors wider roll, Thou, self-consuming, shrivel as a scroll, And wrap the world in one wide pall of flame! SONNET. The soul goes forth and finds no resting place On the wide breast of Life's unquiet sea But in the heart of Man. The blazonry Of Wealth and Power fades out, and leaves no trace; Renown's fresh laurels for awhile may grace The brow that wears them, but the dazzling tree Has canker in its heart; Philosophy Is not Content, and Art's immortal face Is trenched with weary furrows: but the heart Hoards in its cells the satisfying dew Which all our thirst is powerless to exhaust. Let Life's uncertain dignities depart, And if one single manly heart be true, My own, contented, counts them cheaply lost. THE WINTER SOLSTICE. O darkest day of all the year! O day of Winter and of Death! Thy reign is in the North, yet here, The Southern Ocean feels thy breath. Yon ruddy sun, that from the wave Climbs up his path in summer glow, Will light, ere long, a frozen grave, Too cold to melt its pall of snow. And I must find the sunshine pale, The tropic breezes chill and drear, For when the gray autumnal gale Came to despoil the dying year, Passed with the slow retreating sun, As day by day some beams depart, The beauty and the life of one, Whose love made summer in my heart. Day after day, the latest flower, Her faded being waned away, More pale and dim with every hourâ And ceased upon the darkest day! The warmth and glow that with her died No light of coming suns shall bring; The heart its wintry gloom may hide, But cannot feel a second Spring. O darkest day of all the year! In vain thou com'st with balmy skies, For, blotting out their azure sphere, The phantoms of my Fate arise: A blighted life, whose shattered plan No after fortune can restore; The perfect lot, designed for Man, That should be mine, but is no more. She was the sun, that rose above The landscape of the life I dreamed, And through the portals of her love The promise of my Future beamed. Though buried long, those dreams arise To mock me wheresoe'er I roamâ The happy light of household eyes, The blessing and the peace of Home. And I behold the changing fire Of alien heavens increase and pale On many a sunbeam-gilded spire And many a moonlight-silvered sail: The pomp and glory of the lands, The range of Earth, is given to me; But every touch of loving hands Recalls my blighted destiny. IN ARTICULO MORTIS. I would be left aloneâwith none but you, The last, sole friend, where all have fallen off Like summer birds, and left your nest alone Amidst the withered foliage of my heart. Give me your hand: your soul will walk with mine Into the shadows, far as life may go Within the porch of Death, and send its cry Of faithful love across the mighty gulf, When we are forced asunder. Nay, Priest! nay: Stand not between me and the fading light Of my last hour. I know my soul is weighed With many sinsâthe pages of my life Soiled with unworthy records; that I go Redder than scarlet to the awful bar Where God shall judge me: but even, knowing this, And stung with wild, unutterable woe, As the lost chances of my life arise, With all their opportunities of good Deepening the blackness of the evil choice, I will not lean upon another's arm, Or lift my soul upon another's prayer, Or bid a human intercessor plead My perilous cause; but I will stagger on, Beneath my sins, unto the feet of God, For, were the crushing burden tenfold great, He sees the secret heart which they obscure And not withholds His mercy. He is just, And I am sick of human justice. I Will go to Him, who sent me on the earth Wisely, though I have trampled on His gifts; In love, though I have tasted most of pain; And justly, though the monstrous wrongs that men Perpetuate in His name have borne me down Beyond all virtue, but my faith in Him. Go, Priest! the absolution which I seek No prayer of yours can purchase: I have gone Beyond your reach already, and the last Weak props of life one after one give way. O fatherâfather! In what fatal school Learned you the iron creed that drove your child, Sore with the scourging of its rigid laws, To the alluring license of the world? Why did you crush the healthy joys that craved Growth in a liberal air, the motions free That leap along the bounding pulse of Youth And pluck delight in the fresh fields of Time, Building your stern religion round the dreams That fill, self-born, the morning sleep of Life, And give us courage for its day of toil? Had you not hedged each simple joy with sin, And from the guileless blooms of Nature driven My steps, to falter on your arid wastes Of harshest duty, I had never looked To Sin for joy, nor plunged amid the rank, Dense overgrowths of Pleasure, which conceal Her soundless quicksands: had you turned the tide Of warm, impetuous blood, that beat so strong In every vein, to mingle with the streams Of manly action, I had spent its force In watering many a pleasant field of life With fertilizing increase; but you set Your unrelenting dogmas in its path, Locked the dark barrier with a cruel hand, And thought the fierce rebellion you provoked By tyranny against my nature's law, The evidence of Hell! The buttressed walls You built to stay me madly burst away, And like a captive by recovered light Blinded, and in the long-lost airs of Heaven Reeling inebriate, I was tossed along Upon a flood I knew not how to stem, Through the wide sea of desolating years, Until the flying wreck on which you hurled Your stern anathemas, is thrown at last, A heap of ruin, on the barren shores Where the world's outcasts take their bitter leave Of the cold world's injustice. Wholly lost Not then was I, O father! had you shown The awful pathos of a father's grief, Or dropped one word that spoke a father's love, Bursting, as from a heart at lava-glow, Through the cold wrath that made you adamant, In that brief time, when loathingly I turned From the palled company of Vice, to throw My heart, repentant, at the feet of one Who might have lifted me from out the deeps, And set my feet upon the steady paths I labored to recover. But, when you, My father, spurned and drove me back to sin, You snapped the feeble chain to which I clung, And she, and you, and all the blinded worldâ O God, how blind!âyou saw me fall, and fall, And loosed my frantic clutch from every prop Until the floods above my head were rolled So deep, I bade farewell to light and took My portion with the darkness. You have passed To other life already: I will think You did but deal with me as you were taught By heartless laws of Sect, which you mistook For Heaven's commandments. In this solemn hour Death washes out the bitterness that filled The Past, and I forgive:âGod! that a son Should ever have such need! She, whom I found Amid those dreary haunts where brazen Sin Laughed o'er her fall from virtueâshe, whose love, Her only weakness, to the brink betrayed Where one blind step condemns to endless woeâ She was not false: she threw before my feet Her bruised and trampled heart, and from the wrecks Of outraged tenderness built up anew The shrine of Love, the saddened counterfeit Of that, which from the bowers of innocent hearts Sends the pure incense of its perfect joy To God's high throne. She clung to me with truth That might have cleansed her from the stains of shame, Were Man less cruel. Hunted, driven to bay By persecution and by keenest want, She spurned the tempters who would blight the last Pale flower, that in her ravaged fields of life Recalled the happy days when she was pure. Rest thee, thou weary spirit! Were there tears In the cold eyes of men, thy touching faith Should draw them forth, and gentlest Charity, Veiling thy frailties, leave thy memory white With the redemption of that saving love! You, too, my friendâ(still keep my hand in yours, For we are nigh the parting)âyou were true, Faithful where all were faithless. In the dark Which filled the chambers of my soul, you saw The wreck of manliness that might have been, Capacities for love which never came, And the deserted shrines whence Faith had fled: But you alike had suffered from the laws That wrought such devastation; you had felt In suffering, the kind regard of Heaven, And all the guilty records of my life Knit you the closer, till your love became The agent of God's pity. I will think He shall not wholly cast me off, nor doom My soul to endless company with sins I loathed while I committed: that, if He Shut His bright Heaven against me, there may be Among his myriad worlds some lonely place, Though far remote, within the radiant sphere His glory blesses, where she waits for me, And you will join us in a little while. He gave us to each other: will He now Break the sweet links whereby we felt our hearts First drawn to Him? He, the All-Merciful, Who not deserted us when men forsook, And loved when they despised us, will not judge Too harshly, when our naked souls go up To meet His awful presence. ? ? ? ? I am chill, And the room darkens: let me feel your hand Here, where my heart beats feebly. Friendâdear friend! Kiss me upon the cheek, before it grows Too cold, and lift my head upon your breast. Tears on my face? The scalding tears of man, Not lightly shattered from their iron cells, Shed thus for me? It sweetens Death, to know Such rain as this will consecrate my dust. SATURDAY NIGHT AT SEA. Come, messmates, fill the cheerful bowl! To-night let no one fail, No matter how the billows roll, Or roars the ocean gale. There's toil and danger in our lives, But let us jovial be, And drink to sweethearts and to wives, On Saturday night at sea! The chill nor'wester hurls the spray Our icy bulwarks o'er, As swift we cleave our stormy way, A thousand miles from shore; And while the good ship onward drives, Let none forget that he Must drink to sweethearts and to wives, On Saturday night at sea! The joys that landsmen little reck We best can understand, Who live a year upon the deck, A month upon the land. And rough as are our sailor lives, Full tender hearts have we To drink to sweethearts and to wives, On Saturday night at sea! Our frames are worn and little worth, And hard our rugged hands; We struggle for our hold on Earth With the storms of many lands: But the only love that lights our lives Shall still remembered be; We drink to sweethearts and to wives, On Saturday night at sea! THE MID-WATCH. I pace the deck in the dead of night, When the moon and starlight fail, And the cordage creaks to the lazy swells, And heavily flaps the sail. On the darkness glimmers the binnacle-lamp With feeble and lonely spell: No sound but the passing sentry's tramp Or his measured cry: âAll's well!â To and fro, with accustomed step, I walk in the night alone, And I think of a thousand watches kept In the years forever flown; Of the friends in whose manly fellowship I labored long ago, Till Death relieved their watch on earth, And they went to rest below. I think of the gallant ones who died When our broadsides shook the sea, And sorrow for them subdued the pride Of our cheers of victory: Of those who fell in the fevered lands, Or sank in the whelming waveâ Whose corpses waste on the barren sands, Or float in a fathomless grave. And the looks revive that were faint and dim In the shadows of the years, And I scan them o'er till my eyelids swim With the strange delight of tears: They people the dark with their pallid brows As they silently throng around, And the sea its phosphor radiance throws On the faces of the drowned. So many a noble heart is cold That shared my duties then, I have looked full oft in the face of Death, But he comes to better men; And let him come in his chosen time, Some friend will think of me, And I shall live in the lonely hours Of his midnight watch at sea. LAMENT AND CONSOLATION. False, fleeting Youth, ah! whither fled Thy golden promise? Thy joy is past, thy love is dead, And every arrowy hope we sped Falls distant from us. Ah, where the wondrous alchemy Thy steps that haunted? The happy airs of Arcady That fanned thy brow, the fancy free, The faith undaunted? The glories caught from Nature die, And men deceive me; Star after star goes down the sky, And darker, sadder hours are nigh, If Song should leave me. For Song can still the living light Of Memory borrow, With faded dawns to flush the night, And hide with gleams of old delight The present sorrow. Let Faith and Love and Hope depart, Since Fate so wills it: Some foliage yet may shade the heart, And blossom in the beams of Art, Whose presence fills it. On thee, dear Song! the loss I cast, Beyond redressing: Let gone be gone, and past be past, But, Angel! I will hold thee fast, And force thy blessing!</field>
