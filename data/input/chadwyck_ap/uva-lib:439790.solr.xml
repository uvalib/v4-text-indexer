      <field name="fulltext">GOD'S MAJESTY I look upon the budding tree; I watch its leaves expand; And through it all, O God, I see, The marvel of Thy hand. And all my soul in worship sings, O praise the Lord, the King of Kings! I look upon this mortal frame So wonderfully made; I note each perfect vein and nerve And I am sore afraid; I tremble, God, at thought of Thee So awful in Thy Majesty. I look upon the mighty sun, Upon the humble flower; In both, O great and heavenly One, I read Thy wondrous power; And in an ecstasy I raise A song of thankfulness and praise. I look upon the lightnings flash; I see the rain drops fall; I listen to the thunders crash, And find Thee in it all; In earth and sky, and sea and air, Thou, O my God, art everywhere. DEPARTED Love reigned King in my heart one day, Reigned with his courtiers three— Belief unspoken, Trust unbroken, And Faith as deep as the sea. And I cried in sweet pain, “Oh long may they reign, And my heart be their kingdom alway.” But the Courtier's Belief slipped down from his throne And died at the feet of King Love. I saw him falling, all vainly calling To the King and the Courtiers above. And he struggled with death and he labored for breath, Till he died with a heart-broken moan. “But the King and his two noble courtiers still reign, And shall reign forever,” I said; But lo, on the morrow, I wept in keen sorrow, For Trust in his beauty lay dead. And I buried him low, and I said, “Now I know How to value the two who remain.” But Faith drooped and died; and Love sat alone, And he pined for the ones who were dead; A king without reason he reigned for a season But his strength and his glory had fled. And no pain stirred my breast and I said, “It is best,” When he tottered and fell from his throne. HEART'S EASE Give me work for my hands to do, Whenever I have a grief; There's no other balm so good I ween For a wounded Heart's relief. And give me something to think about, Something beside my pain; And let me labor throughout the day With a busy hand and brain. From the flush of morn till the gloom of night With never a time to weep; And then in the gloaming let me turn Like a weary child to sleep. STARS Astronomers may gaze the heavens o'er, Discovering wonders, great perhaps and true— That stars are worlds and peopled like our own; But I shall never think as these men do. I shall believe them little shining things, Fashioned from heavenly ore and filled with light; And to the skies above so smoothly blue An angel comes and nails them every night. And I have seen him. You, no doubt, would think A white cloud sailed across the heaven's blue; But as I watched the feathery thing, it was An angel nailing up the stars I knew. And all night long they shine for us below, Shine in pale splendor till the mighty sun Wakes up again. And then the angel comes And gathers in his treasures one by one. How sweet the task; and when this life is done And I have joined the angel band on high, Of all that throng, Oh, may it be my task To nail the stars upon the evening sky. SOMEBODY SWEET A robin up in the linden tree, Merrily sings this lay: “Somebody Sweet is three years old, Three years old to-day.” Somebody's bright blue eyes look up, Through tangled curls of gold, And two red lips unclose to say, “To-day I am free years old.” Clouds were over the sky this morn, But now they are sailing away; Clouds could never obscure the sun On Somebody Sweet's birthday. Bluest of skies and greenest of trees, Sunlight and birds and flowers, These are Nature's birthday gifts To this sweet pet of ours. The pantry is brimming with cakes and creams For Somebody's birthday ball. Papa and mamma bring their gifts But their love is better than all. Ribbons and sashes and dainty robes, Gifts of silver and gold Will fade and rust as the days go by, But their hearts will not grow cold. Then laugh in the sunlight, Somebody Sweet, Little flower of June; You have nothing to do with care, For life is in perfect tune. Loving hearts and sheltering arms Shall keep old care away For many a year from Somebody Sweet, Who is three years old to-day. [Speak for me, friend, whose lips are ever ready] Speak for me, friend, whose lips are ever ready With chosen words, to voice another's thought; My shaken heart would make my tones unsteady; Speak thou the words I ought. Say that the love I give in lavish fashion, To all God's living creatures everywhere, Pervades me with a deep and holy passion, A wordless, grateful prayer. Say that the gifts I may have used too lightly, As children toss rare gems in careless mirth, From this glad hour, henceforth shall shine more brightly And prove their honest worth. Say that my life shall be one grand endeavor To reach a nobler womanhood's fair height; Say how my earnest aim is to forever Be worthy of this night. GRANITE BAY At Granite Bay, such beauty lies, In rocks, in waters and in skies, As poets dream of Paradise. The rocks that clasp fair Granite Bay First saw her charms at break of day And flushed to pink from somber gray. To guard this bay from rude alarms And shelter her from all that harms Great trees reach out protecting arms. Down to the very water's edge, Between the granite rocks they wedge, And watch in silence from each ledge. Defending points and islands stand And reefs of rocks run out from land, To keep rude billows well in hand. The river and the bay are friends; One slender arm the river bends And all her anchored boats defends. So much one island loves her grace, He fronts all dangers in his place, To shield the beauty of her face. Loved by the forest and the shore, While sun and moon, and skies adore, The strong rocks hold her evermore. At Granite Bay the wild winds rest; The sunlight is her welcome guest; The moon goes mad upon her breast. Not here is heard the sea gulls' scream. They come, but only come to dream: Far out at sea their sorrows seem. At Granite Bay, far out at sea My cares and troubles seem to me; Love, joy and hope remain, these three. Though forth my wandering footsteps stray, To realms and regions far away, My heart dwells here, in Granite Bay. LINCOLN When God created this good world A few stupendous peaks were hurled From His strong hand, and they remain, The wonder of the level plain. But these colossal heights are rare, While shifting sands are everywhere. So with the race. The centuries pass, And nations fall like leaves of grass. They die—forgotten and unsung, While straight from God some souls are flung To live, immortal and sublime. So lives great Lincoln for all time. JAMAICA The fairest Island in the seas, The darling of the Sun; Her friends abide on every side But in her heart dwells one Who loves her for her own dear sake, Blake, Blake, Blake. He decked her with colossal gifts And flung them at her feet; He showed her worth to all the earth In splendid bridge and street; Then let his name the echoes wake. Blake, Blake, Blake. [A radiant soul with genius bright] A radiant soul with genius bright Now lends to other realms delight; Let Heaven be glad, let earth rejoice Since unto us was left his voice. ON AVON'S BREAST One day when England's June was at its best I saw a stately and imperious swan Floating on Avon's fair, untroubled breast. Sudden it seemed as if all strife had gone Out of the world; all discord, all unrest. The sorrows and the sinnings of the race Faded away like nightmares in the dawn: All heaven was one blue background for the grace Of Avon's beautiful, slow moving swan And earth held nothing mean or commonplace. Life seemed no longer to be hurrying on With unbecoming haste, but softly trod As one who reads in emerald leaf, no lawn, Or crimson rose, a message straight from God. On Avon's breast I saw a stately swan. THE ENGLISHMAN Born in the flesh and bred in the bone, Some of us harbor still A New World pride: and we flaunt or hide The Spirit of Bunker Hill. We claim our place as a separate race Or a self-created clan: Till there comes a day, when we like to say “We are kin of the Englishman.” For under the front that seems so cold And the voice that is wont to storm, We are certain to find a big broad mind And a heart that is soft—and warm. He carries his woes in a lordly way, As only the great souls can: And it makes us glad when in truth we say “We are kin of the Englishman.” He slams his door in the face of the world, If he thinks the world too bold: He will even curse: but he opens his purse To the poor, and the sick and the old. He is slow in giving to woman the vote, And slow to pick up her fan: But he GIVES HER ROOM IN THE HOUR OF DOOM And DIES—LIKE AN Englishman! ALL IN A COACH AND FOUR The quality folk went riding along All in a Coach and Four— And pretty Annette, in a calico gown (Bringing her marketing things from town) Stopped short with her Sunday store, And wondered if ever it would betide That she, in a long-plumed hat, would ride Away in a Coach and Four. A lord there was—oh a lonely soul, There in the Coach and Four, His years were young, but his heart was old And he hated his coaches and hated his gold, (Those things which we all adore) And he thought how sweet it would be to trudge Along with the fair little country drudge And away from his Coach and Four. So back he rode the very next day All in his Coach and Four, And he went each day, whether dry or wet, Until he married the sweet Annette (In spite of her lack of lore). But they didn't trudge off on foot together For he bought her a hat with a long, long feather And they rode in the Coach and Four. Now a thing like this could happen we know All in a Coach and Four, But the fact of it is, 'twixt me and you, There isn't a word of this jingle true (Pardon, I do implore); It is only a foolish and fanciful song That came to me as I rode along All in a Coach and Four. THOUGHTS ON LEAVING JAPAN A changing medley of insistent sounds, Like broken airs played on a samisen, Pursues me, as the waves blot out the shore. The trot of wooden heels; the warning cry Of patient runners; laughter and strange words Of children, children, children everywhere: The clap of reverent hands before some shrine; And over all the haunting temple bells, Waking, in silent chambers of the soul, Dim memories of long-forgotten lives. But oh! the sorrow of the undertone; The wail of hopeless weeping in the dawn From lips that smiled through gilded bars at night. Brave little people of large aims, you bow Too often and too low before the Past; You sit too long in worship of the dead. Yet have you risen, open-eyed, to greet The great material Present. Now salute The greater Future, blazing its bold trail Through old traditions. Leave your dead to sleep In quiet peace with God. Let your concern Be with the living, and the yet unborn; Bestow on them your thoughts, and waste no time In costly honors to insensate dust. Unlock the doors of usefulness, and lead Your lovely daughters forth to larger fields, Away from jungles of the ancient sin. For oh! the sorrow of that undertone, The wail of hopeless weeping in the dawn From lips that smiled through gilded bars at night. THE DIABUTSU Long have I searched cathedral, shrine and hall, To find an image from the hand of art That gave the full expression, not a part, Of that ecstatic peace which follows all Life's pain and passion. Strange it should befall That outer emblem of the inner heart Was waiting far beyond the great world's mart— Immortal answer to the mortal call. Unknown the artist; vaguely known his creed! But the bronze wonder of his work sufficed To lift me to the heights his faith had trod. For one rich moment, opulent indeed, I walked with Krishna, Buddha and the Christ, And felt the full serenity of God. KAIULANI Dreaming of thrones she grew from child to maid, While under royal palms soft fountains played. She saw herself in Time's appointed hour Ruling her kingdom by love's potent power, Her radiant youth imperially arrayed Where tropic suns were tempered by sweet shade, Protecting love her pleasant pathway laid, And there she dwelt, a Princess in her bower Dreaming of thrones. Marauding changes brutally invade Her Island home; and yet Time's hand is stayed. Her name has left the fragrance of a flower; And in the regal state that was her dower She sleeps in beauteous youth that cannot fade Dreaming of thrones. AT THE BORO BOEDOR Watching the dawn upon its turrets break (New beauties leaping to each ray of light), Methought I heard Christ calling (as one might Call to an older brother): “Buddha, wake! Come toil with me. From thy calm eyelids shake The dreams of ages; and behold the sight Of earth still sunk in ignorance and night. I took thy labor—now thy portion take. “Too vast the effort for one Avatar, My brave disciples are not overwise, Our kindred creeds they do not understand; My cross they worship, yet thy temples mar, Dear brother Buddha, from Nirvana rise, And let us work together, hand in hand.” THE FINISH Out of that wonderful world where God is, The Lords of Karma the path have shown. And given us lessons to learn in bodies— Oh, many the bodies our souls have known! In gem, and blossom, and sentient being. In dull cave dweller and thinking man. All things knowing, and feeling, and seeing— This is the purpose and this the plan. Forms are fashioned in wide world places From flame and ether and common clay; While egos wait in the high star spaces Till the call shall come, which they must obey. Oh, never a wish or a hope lies hidden Of good or evil in any heart. But back to earth shall the soul be bidden To live out its longing, and play its part. Grief and pleasure and joy and sorrow, Out of old sowings we gather them all— And the seed of to-day we shall harvest to-morrow, When our souls come back at the karmic call. Over and over the lesson learning, Till, letter perfect, and meaning clear— Back on the spiral pathway turning We carry the knowledge we gathered here. The thought of that last journey back to Him When there is no more longing or desire For anything but God left in my soul, Shines in the distance like a great white flame. I think the way will lead through golden clouds Skirting the shores of seas of amethyst! And winding gently upward; past old worlds, Where body after body was outlived, Past Hells and Heavens, where I had my day With comrade Spirits from the lesser spheres And paid my penalty for every sin And reaped reward for every worthy act: Past Realms Celestial and their singing hosts (Where once I chanted with the cherubim) Out into perfect silence. Suddenly An all enveloping vast consciousness Of long, long journeys finished: one more turn Then glory, glory, glory infinite And selfhood lost in being one with God. The ray once more absorbed into the Sun. The cycle done. YOU PROMISED ME All holy books of earth, all churches and all creeds, Are based on spirit miracles. Moses, Elias, Matthew, Mark and John, Paul and Cornelius, Buddha, Swedenborg, All talked with Angels, Yea, and many more. That was a mighty promise that you made me:—not once, But many a time, Whenever we discussed the topic death— You promised me that were such things possible In God's vast Universe, You would send back a message to my listening soul, Now am I listening with bated breath. Always on earth you kept you promises. Why! never once Through all the years, the wonderful great years We walked together Did you forego your word and break a pledge However trivial its purpose. Surely that habit of a loyal mind endures; Surely that soul of yours Has not been changed so utterly because it laid aside The body which had died— That it forgets a solemn promise made to me Not once, but many a time. Why! such forgetfulness would be a crime Against love, faith and hope, the precious three. It could not be. So am I waiting, watching—in the light—and listening in the dark— For any sight, or sound you may have sent: So do I lean and hark— Night in, day out— Nor will I let my starved and eager spirit doubt Or sink in discontent Because no answer comes. You promised me: some day, some way Will open for you, dear, to keep your word. So many eyes have seen—so many ears have heard. Moses, Elias, Matthew, Mark and John— Paul and Cornelius, Buddha, Swedenborg— All talked with Angels. Science, which once denied, now patiently investigates. I do not seek alone. And I will knock upon the door of heaven And shake God's window with the hands of prayer, Asking for those old Angels, wise with centuries Of large experience, to come to you, Oh my beloved, and to show you how To keep your promise, made in solemn faith— To bridge the River Death, And rend the veil between. So many ears have heard—so many eyes have seen— Why not mine own? I do not seek alone— You promised me. Written in California, 1916. [Oh, I am nothing, nothing] Oh, I am nothing, nothing— I only can lie at His feet: A broken and emptied vessel For the Master's use made meet. Broken that He may mend me, Emptied that He may fill: Teach me, O God in the silence,— How to be still. DAILY TALKS So much I miss those daily talks with you, O my Beloved! Though you answer not, (In any manner that of old I knew) Yet will I seek in each familiar spot, To bring your sympathetic spirit near Where it may hear My inmost thoughts, in written words revealed. Perchance my bleeding heart may thus be healed, Of that deep wound this silence makes therein. The world has no harsh sound, no clash, no din So hard to bear as silence day on day, And night on night, the while we plead and pray For some faint echo from the world unseen. Dear, you have been A year and three score days lost to my sight, And to my touch and hearing; and despite My life-long faith in Heaven's proximity, And in communion of souls linked by love, Yet do we seem divided by a sea Across whose still unatlassed waters move Out-going silent ships, that come not back. Still do I watch the track Of that strange midnight craft, whereon you sailed. Believing love like yours which never failed On earth to keep its promises will find Some way to give mine eyes, which now are blind, Their clearer sight, and to prepare my ear Its message from the other world to hear. The while I wait, perchance you, too, wait near, Attentive, smiling, in the olden way, Beloved, day by day. [Here is a picture I carry away] Lines Written on the Presentation of an American Banner to Camp Rochambeau, by the Marquise de Rochambeau at Tours, France, June, 1, 1918. Here is a picture I carry away On memory's wall; a green June day— A golden sun in an amethyst sky, And a beautiful banner floating as high As the lofty spires of the city of Tours, And a slender Marquise, with a face as pure As a sculptured Saint; while staunch and true In new world khaki, and old world blue, Wearing their medals with modest pride, Her stalwart body-guard stand at her side. Simple the picture, but much it may mean To one who reads into and under the scene. For there in that opulent hour and weather, Two Great Republics came closer together; A little nearer came land to land, Through the magical touch of a woman's hand. And once again as in long ago The grand old name of de Rochambeau Shines forth like a star, for our world to see, Our Land of the Brave, and our Home of the Free. ON WITH THE DANCE We have come over death charged seas, to fight the foes of France; The foes of France, the foes of earth, the foes of God on High. Oh think not that because we laugh, because we sing and dance, We have forgotten this grave fact—to-morrow we may die. The ocean billows leap and lilt, when tides are at full flow, But never yet a wave forgot the depths that lay below. As David danced before the Lord, we dance now in our joy At being part of this great force for justice and for truth. Strong as the old Olympian gods that won the siege of Troy! We glory in our brawn and brain, and in our splendid youth. We glory in the right to live and use our manhood's dower, And if need be, the right to die in this stupendous hour. America holds out her hand to beautiful brave France, Her friends are ours, her foes are ours. On! On, now with the dance! [For the ceaseless prayer of a soul is heeded] For the ceaseless prayer of a soul is heeded, When the prayer asks only for light and faith, And the faith and the light, and the knowledge needed, Shall gild with glory the path to death. Oh heart of the world by sorrow shaken, Hear ye the message I have to give. The seal from the lips of the dead is taken, And they can say to you, “Lo, we live!”</field>
