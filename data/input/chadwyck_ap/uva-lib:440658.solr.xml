      <field name="fulltext">TO GEORGE P. MORRIS, Esq. THIS LITTLE VOLUME IS AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED, BY HIS FRIEND, SAMUEL WOODWORTH.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MELODIES. I...PASTORAL AND AMATORY. [Whate'er the charms of mead or grove] Whate'er the charms of mead or grove, In nature's brightest colours drest, Of all the flowers that bloom, I love The modest primrose best. [Ye fair, who seek a splendid lot] Ye fair, who seek a splendid lot, Behold content, a richer prize, Within the humblest ploughman's cot, That rank and pride despise. In palace or cot, whatever your lot, The farmer your table supplies. [No more pursue the city's fleeting toys] No more pursue the city's fleeting toys, But seek, in rural scenes, for calmer joys. [And now relieved from day's turmoil] And now relieved from day's turmoil, Let festive pleasures fill each breast, And no intruding sorrows spoil The song and mirthful jest. For lords of the soil, and fed by our toil, American farmers are blest. [The fortune I crave, and I covet no more] Air—Cottage on the moor. The fortune I crave, and I covet no more, Is health, rural pleasures, apparel, and food, The friend that I love, and the girl I adore, In a neat little cottage that stands near a wood Smile of Affection. Music by Davies. As sung in the pastoral Opera of the Forest Rose. Is there a light whose effulgence can dry The tear of affliction, and rapture restore? 'Tis the bright sunny ray of a love-beaming eye, The smile of affection from one I adore. I'd sigh not for grandeur, for fame, or for wealth, But, thankful for little, would wish for no more, If blest with a cottage, with friendship, and health, And the smile of affection from one I adore. [While flocks and herds in safety feed] While flocks and herds in safety feed, The shepherd wakes his tuneful reed; Or, leaning on his rustic crook, Beneath the shade, beside a brook, Carols the lazy hours away, Till sylvan echoes catch the lay. [While slaves of ambition sell comfort for fame] While slaves of ambition sell comfort for fame, Be mine the applause of the wise and the good, A conscience that daily acquits me of blame, In a neat little cottage that stands near a wood. [In life's fair morn, when sunshine warm'd the scene] In life's fair morn, when sunshine warm'd the scene, And fairy hopes danced o'er the laughing green, My infant muse essay'd the artless strain, On Charles's bank, or Newton's verdant plain. [Now sober Pomona has won] Now sober Pomona has won The frolicksome Flora's domains, And the work the gay goddess begun, The height of maturity gains. Variety. The noblest talent love can claim, Is never to appear the same; For 'tis variety alone, That props the urchin-tyrant's throne. So do the seasons, as they range, Afford new pleasure when they change: The sweetest flower would cease to cheer, Should fragrant spring bloom all the year. Beside a Streamlet. Beside a streamlet, where the whispering reeds And fragrant flags upon its borders play, Where down the valley it meandering leads, My infant footsteps first were taught to stray. The sylvan Muse enticed me to her cell, My childish fingers wanton'd o'er her lyre, And, pleased to hear the rustic numbers swell, I fondly thought that others must admire. So, as I grew, and learn'd to sweep the strings, By art directed, though less sweetly wild, I envied not the happiness of kings, My lyre was bliss, and I a happy child. With fond regret I left that calm retreat, Diversified with meadows, groves, and hills, Where nature's charms in sweet disorder meet, With Charles's thousand tributary rills. [How oft, reclined beside a babbling stream] How oft, reclined beside a babbling stream I sang of love—a minstrel's sweetest dream, And sang sincerely—for I felt the theme.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MELODIES. II...AMATORY AND SENTIMENTAL. THE BUDDING HOPES. The budding hopes which hourly spring, While Fancy's bower is young and green, Too often perish ere they fling Their viewless odours round the scene; But, oh! there's one, which, planted here, The heart's red current flows to cherish, And should that blossom disappear, The soil it springs from too must perish. [My gentle Muse on Heliconia strays] My gentle Muse on Heliconia strays, Or gaily sports in sweet Pierian bowers, And, when descending to inspire my lays, Her airy form is but the breath of flowers. [While folly's shrine attracts the fair] While folly's shrine attracts the fair, Blame not the beaux who worship there; If gods for you took meaner shapes, No wonder we descend to apes; Let beauty smile on worth alone, And fops and fools will not be known. THE NOSEGAY. Here the rose and lily, twining, Her enchanting face bespeak; For the sweetest hues, combining, Decorate her lovely cheek. In this blushing pink that deck'd her, Glows an emblem of her lip, Both distilling purest nectar, Both inviting mine to sip. In this violet I discover Her sweet eye's cerulean hue, Like the star of love, above her, Sparkling in etherial blue.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MELODIES. III.. SENTIMENTAL AND CONVIVIAL. [Eve shuts her windows—let me now advance] Eve shuts her windows—let me now advance To where the viol leads the mazy dance; Where pleasure warms the heart and lights the eye, While bounding pulses to the music fly. NOW AMITY, HOPE, AND PLEASURE. An Italian Air. Now amity, hope, and pleasure, Smile placidly, kiss, and toy, While trippingly dance in measure, Love, liberty, peace, and joy. Night's ebony car descending, Rolls rapidly down the sky, While numerous sylphs attending, Show revelry's hour is nigh. Now amity, hope, and pleasure, Smile placidly, kiss, and toy, While trippingly dance in measure, Love, liberty, peace, and joy. Late dismally pining daily, Hearts languidly sunk in wo, Now merrily bounding gaily, All playfully throb and glow. Now amity, hope, and pleasure, Smile placidly, kiss and toy, While trippingly dance in measure, &amp;c. A FAIR VOCALIST. “What nymph,” ask'd Apollo, “will deign for awhile, Which one of the nine, will repair to the isle Where virtue, and learning, and genius, and taste, Have chang'd to an Eden Manhattan's rude waste? The science of Philipps no longer can charm, The sweetness of Incledon ceases to warm, And the eager inhabitants look to the nine For something superior—something divine?” “For something divine!” sage Minerva exclaim'd, “Their wish has been realized ere it was named; The sweetest of voices and faces unite Their ears, and their eyes, and their hearts, to delight; For the muses, and graces, and Pallas, have joined To embellish her person, and polish her mind. From sirens she pilfer'd each tone that entrances, From Cupid her dimples, from Venus her glances; Thus enrich'd by celestials with sweetness and worth, She charms, in the person of Holman, on earth. [The Muse no more in foreign climes shall roam] The Muse no more in foreign climes shall roam, While we've such scenes and incidents at home. [Clear and transparent, like a crystal vase] Clear and transparent, like a crystal vase, The female mind its real worth displays; Whether its hue our praise or censure win, It takes its colour from the stores within. FASHION. To tyrant Fashion all must yield, He rules with sway despotic, And he who dares contest the field, Must be indeed Quixotic. But though, when he appears, we must, Like courteous slaves, receive him; The wise will ne'er embrace him first, Nor be the last to leave him. FRIENDSHIP. From this bright source a stream of blessings flows, To more than balance all Pandora's woes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MELODIES. IV...NATIONAL AND PATRIOTIC. A MASONIC ODE. Air—Hail to the Chief. Dark was the hour, when Columbia, despairing, Breathed her petitions for succour in vain, While in her vallies the war-torch was glaring, Sweeping her hamlets and cots from the plain. Wounded and bleeding her sons were retiring, Flush'd with successes, the foeman pursued; Freedom and Hope seem'd in tortures expiring, Heroes were sleeping in death, unsubdued “Great source of light!” she cried, “No more thy presence hide, “Is there no help? We are sorely beset.” Soon as the mourner spoke, Bright rays of glory broke, Round a young hero—the brave La Fayette. Lo! from the east, with a mystic resplendence, Rose the bright star which enlightened the gloom; Led by its ray, and our loved Independence, Came the young knight, with his bright glossy plume. Washington saw, and with rapture elated, Press'd to his bosom the chivalrous boy; Tyranny frown'd, and with hate unabated, Sought, like a Herod, the youth to destroy. Fierce raged the vengeful fray, Till freemen gain'd the day, Age-frosted veterans remember it yet: Then gallant Washington Hail'd Gallia's godlike son, Champion of freedom, the brave La Fayette. Thus was the temple of freedom erected, Crown'd with the key-stone of union and love; Wisdom, and Beauty, and Strength, were connected, Three noble pillars which nothing can move. Tyrants may rage, and in triple alliance, Seek to demolish so sacred a dome; Trusting in Heaven, we bid them defiance, While we thus welcome its architect home. Hail! friend of Washington! Hail! Gallia's godlike son! Brother! companion! as such dearer yet, Long may thy friendly smile Our festive hours beguile, Long may freemasons thus hail La Fayette. HAIL, LA FAYETTE! Air—The Last Bugle. Hark! the martial drum hails the approach of the brave! The hero who comes o'er the proud-swelling wave, To the land he defended, the land of the free, Which greets his return with a grand jubilee, While her sons, to acknowledge sweet gratitude's debt, Now awake the loud bugle, to hail La Fayette. All hail, gallant soldier! thy fame shall extend, As Liberty's champion, and Washington's friend, Till all, in the light of its glory, shall see A world disenthrall'd, independent, and free; While millions, inspired by sweet gratitude's debt, Shall awake the loud bugle, to hail La Fayette. LA FAYETTE. See him surrounded by admiring crowds, And modestly receive their salutations, While their united plaudits rend the clouds, To prove republics may be grateful nations. Behold him grasp some hoary veteran's hand, Or press an old associate to his breast, While in his eyes the tears of rapture stand, By which the noblest feelings are exprest. Behold him in the festive scene, where one Full tide of pleasure through each bosom flows, Or bending o'er the tomb of Washington, Or on the ensanguined spot where freedom's foes Beheld him leading her resistless van— In every scene you find him still—a man. But O, the moral grandeur of that hour, When introduced beneath our Senate's dome, The solemn conclave hailed him welcome home, Leaves human language destitute of power To do it justice. It was more sublime Than any scene upon the page of time. PROGRESS OF IMPROVEMENT. Yes, blest Columbians!—In this favour'd clime, What new-born beauties mark the track of time! His every footstep, through the forest's gloom, Gives birth to flowerets of unfading bloom. No crumbling towers (the monuments of pride And stern oppression) at his touch divide; No fertile fields here fade beneath his tread, No smoke of blazing cities wreathes his head; But in his path a blushing Eden springs, While countless joys are scatter'd from his wings! Our late departed guest, brave La Fayette, To whom Columbia owes so vast a debt, With almost speechless joy and wonder, traced Refinement's progress through the savage waste, Where erst his youthful arm had bared the blade, The drooping cause of liberty to aid; When from a princely court he sped his way To meet the foes of freedom in the fray; Resolved for glory's dazzling goal to run, And share the prize with none but Washington! Where then dark forests echoed war's alarms, The veteran now beheld rich cultured farms! With meadows, orchards, fields of waving grain, And herds of cattle grazing on the plain! Where then the wolf and panther prowl'd for prey, He now beheld our flocks in safety stray! Saw lowing kine supply the milk-maid's pail, Where antlered stags once bounded through the vale! And heard the shepherd's wild-notes sweetly swell O'er the rocks once startled by the Indian yell! More westward still, he turn'd his wondering eyes, Where hamlets, towns, and villages, arise Along the course of that stupendous chain Which now unites fair Erie to the main. Commerce was there, in all his golden pride, With blooming agriculture at his side; While smiling plenty followed in their train, And pour'd her bounties o'er the teeming plain; The chief beheld, and felt his bosom glow, To view the blessings which from freedom flow. But when he saw the sages of the land Convened, to place in some deserving hand The reins of power, the car of state to guide, In peace or war, whatever fate betide; A chief installed, without that vain parade Which dazzles vassals when their kings are made— Fired with the moral grandeur of the scene, With tear-drops gushing from an eye serene, He saw—he heard—and with expanding breast, Pronounced Columbia's sons supremely blest. [Fair Science her portals of light shall unfold] Fair Science her portals of light shall unfold, And Genius soar upwards on pinions of gold. MY LYRE. Columbia call'd—to arms her heroes sprung, I felt the impulse, and of glory sung; Swept o'er the chords, assumed a loftier lay, And venturous dared with bolder hand to play. THE GRAND CANAL. Air—Huzza! Here's Columbia for ever! Triumphant! victorious! the rapturous lay The voice of each freeman awakes, For Neptune and Erie were wedded to-day, The ocean is join'd to the lakes. 'Tis the triumph of mind over matter we hail, In pæans of rapture and praise; The genius of Clinton will ever prevail, And light the whole world with its rays. Huzza! huzza! huzza! for the work is completed, The glory and pride of our state. The waters have met, and they never can part, While the earth shall continue to roll; Of the universe now is our city the mart, And its fame shall enlighten the whole. 'Tis the triumph of mind over matter we hail, In pæans of rapture and praise, The genius of Clinton will ever prevail, And light the whole world with its rays. Huzza! huzza! huzza! for the work is completed, The glory and pride of the state. CRITICISM. To native genius would you prove a friend, Point out his faults, and teach him how to mend. OUR COUNTRY. Now Commerce revives, and her hundred wheels roll, Our canvas is spread from equator to pole; Antipodes gaze on our banner unfurl'd, For the course of our eagle shall girdle the world. The genius of plenty her office resumes, The treasures of India—Arabia's perfumes, Each gem and each fruit that the world can produce, Her horn pours around for our pleasure or use. TO A YOUNG LADY, With a miniature volume of Montgomery's Poems, as published in Boston, 1807. [A JUVENILE PRODUCTION.] Accept, lovely maiden, this little bequest, An advocate certain my suit to obtain; To the generous, feeling, susceptible breast, The muse of Montgomery plead not in vain. And when that sweet eye of cerulean hue, Drops the warm tear of pity for virtue distressed, Then think of the donor, whose sympathy true, The number thou shed'st will engrave on his breast. While Switzerland's Wanderer draws on the heart For the tribute which sentiment e'er must bestow; Then think of thy friend, in a far distant part, A Wanderer press'd with his portion of wo. And when o'er the Grave thou art bending with pain, But a pain not unmingled with pensive delight, Let one gem of pity be shed for the swain Who is buried to pleasure, when banished thy sight. While the tones of the Lyre brighten sadness to joy, And thou hearest with rapture its solacing lays, Remember the youth whose delightful employ Is to sing to his lyre while it warbles thy praise. The Remonstrance to Winter is heard and obeyed, And Flora unfolds every beautiful hue; But remember, tho' nature in spring is arrayed, To me all is winter while absent from you. The Fowler's simplicity cannot but please, Religion has beauties that never decay; E'en Grief has its Joy, and anguish finds ease, In listening to pious Montgomery's lay. Alexandria's Battle admire, not approve, But haste from the scene to the Pillow for rest; On the pinion of fancy then pensively rove, But let thy friend's image still dwell in thy breast. View Brown with compassion, breathe pity's soft sigh, For sorrows unmerited, cruel, unjust; But smile on the Thunder-storm rolling on high, 'Tis the voice of thy God, but he wars not with dust. Hail the brave Volunteers of Albion's isle, And cherish the patriot glow in thy breast; St. Mark's ancient Vigil a tear may beguile, Thy friend then remember, like Edwin distressed. Remember thy friend—is the donor's request, And this Advocate proffers his suit to obtain; To the generous, feeling, susceptible breast, The muse of Montgomery pleads not in vain. OUR COUNTRY. The names of our heroes, recorded by Fame, Shall glow in her tablets in letters of flame; And patriots, and sages, and bards yet unborn, With splendour as brilliant the page shall adorn.</field>

THE HARD-HEARTED LANDLORD. In Ormond's garret, near proud Hudson's stream, Resided once a fond contented pair: The youthful Edwin, just in wedlock join'd To the dear object of his boyish love, The fair Amelia. Though their humble hopes Were bounded by necessity's demand, They were but barely realized; and want Would sometimes knock, but never dared intrude. Yet still industry, by affection urged, With frugal management, and sprightly health, Secured them comfort and domestic peace; Each homely meal receiving higher zest, From being earn'd before it was enjoy'd. One year roll'd round, and in their favour left A trifling balance, after all demands Were satisfied with scrupulous exactness. Sacred treasure! for one fond event Now hastening on, the consecrated boon Was joyfully reserved; while smiling hope Lent double vigour to the daily task Which fed the pair, and saved the little fund. But, ah! relentless fate had woes in store Unmerited by virtue such as theirs. The tender moment, destined to complete Their little plan of happiness, arrived; But only came to blast their fondest hopes. The poor Amelia, after nameless pangs, That push'd her to the precipice of fate, And left her trembling on its dizzy verge, Usher'd to light, but not to life, a babe. Edwin, distracted, o'er the sufferer hung, As though his loved Amelia's wasting life Was with the web of his existence wove. Night after night, and day succeeding day, His eyes estranged from sleep, his frame from rest, He watch'd her fading form, and by her couch, Entranced in speechless agony, remained. Physicians, nurses, nostrums, fuel, food, And all the nameless calls of sickness, soon Exhausted Edwin's little frugal store, And nought but want, disease, and deep despair, Remain'd the inmates of his drear abode. The few utensils of domestic use Their humble means afforded, one by one, Were sacrificed to stern relentless want; Till the poor couch on which Amelia lay (The scene of all his joys and all his woes) Alone remain'd of Edwin's worldly wealth. 'Twas at this crisis, while the husband stood, Absorb'd in grief, beside the senseless fair, His landlord entered. Ormond, who could count The annual tribute of an hundred rents; Ormond, whose coffers groan'd with their contents, POETRY. Music's fair sister—for behold in each, Are nameless graces which no methods teach, And which a master's hand alone can reach. [Sacred to Virtue, let this marble stand] Sacred to Virtue, let this marble stand, And time forbear the tablet to destroy, Whose lay disarms the king of terrors' hand— “Death is the gate to everlasting joy.” EPITAPH. This frail memorial cannot tell his worth, For brighter virtues seldom bloom on earth; Nor in one heart such various beauties blend, As husband, father, mason, christian, friend. These duties done, to heaven his spirit bears The widow's blessing, and the orphan's prayers; For such his active charity has bless'd, And they must love him most who knew him best. EPIGRAM. “'Tis priestcraft all,” the impious atheist cries, “The world was made by chance—the Bible lies!” 'Twere useless such assertions to repel; But what if chance has also made a hell?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">POEMS. MISCELLANEOUS PIECES. OUR NATIVE LAND. In this vast rising empire of the west, With freedom, science, fame, and plenty blest, Where earthly comforts in profusion flow, Each virtuous bosom must with rapture glow; For here, where Liberty her fane has built, No grief is found, but in the path of guilt; No pains, nor fears, the good man's heart annoy, No tears are shed but those of sympathy or joy. [The cross is rear'd, the Turkish cresent wanes] The cross is rear'd, the Turkish cresent wanes, Grecia no more shall wear a despot's chains. TO AMY. What if the awful mandate should be given, By Him who spoke creation into birth, To blot for ever from the map of heaven, The polar star—would this enamoured earth Still pay its adoration to the spot Where once it twinkled? Banish such a thought— Believe me, dearest Amy, it would not. And would the widowed needle still present Its polished point, to where that planet shone? Would all its mystic powers be idly spent, Its homage paid to vacancy alone, While Love's warm star was beaming in the west? O no—its influence soon would be confest, And, till it pointed there, the trembler would not rest. Such is the heart—its favourite star is gone, And is it doomed to tremble without rest? O, must such matchless beauty waste alone, Designed by heaven to make a lover blest? O, no, dear girl! defeat not heaven's design, Reward my love, O, say thou wilt be mine, Or give me leave to hope, and I will not repine. REJECTED ADDRESS. Intended for the opening of the New-York Theatre. When simple nature first devised the plan, And gave the chart of life to erring man, With tearful eye, dejected Pity traced His cheerless path across the sterile waste, Nor found, amid the wilderness of woes A single spot for shelter or repose. There roved the form and image of her God, Wild as the dreary trackless realms he trod; Savage and rude, uncultured, unrefined, By turns the prey and butcher of his kind. She saw, and sighed, in agony of soul, And prayed that Mercy would revise the scroll. With magic pencil, dipt in hues of light, Art touched the map, and all the scene was bright A thousand islets, crown'd with sylvan bowers, The freshest verdure, and the sweetest flowers, With gushing fountains, pure meandering rills, Delightful valleys, and majestic hills, Refresh'd with dews—by fragrant zephyrs fann'd, Seem'd scatter'd o'er that shoreless sea of sand; The goddess saw—dismiss'd her false alarms, And own'd that life was not without its charms. Among those charms, designed by polish'd art To warm the fancy, and improve the heart, The Drama opes its bright enchanting scenes, Its object use—amusement but the means; For though the muse resort to fiction's aid, Fiction is here but truth in masquerade; And thousands, who her grave entreaties shun, Are, by her borrowed smiles, allured and won. She shows what ills beset our devious way, When reason yields to passion's lawless sway, And what inspiring hopes his steps attend, Who clings to Virtue as his guide and friend; What glory crowns the hero and the sage, Whose present labours bless a future age; And what celestial ecstacies reward Each act that conscience, truth, and Heav'n applaud. Where'er is felt the drama's genial sway, The mists of vice and ignorance melt away, Refinement follows, and her empire grows Till moral deserts blossom like the rose. Thus has her power this growing city blest, The pride, the boast, the mistress of the west; Where genius, science, arts, and taste abound, And every sweet embellishment is found; And where the drama sees her cause extend, Till virtue hails her as her warmest friend; While bigot Prejudice, with scowl austere, Views her new temple proudly towering here; A fane, which we to-night, with rituals due, Would consecrate to genius and to you. Accept the offering—let this splendid pile, Illumed by beauty's soul-inspiring smile, Become the school of morals, wit, and taste, By art embellished, and by fashion graced; 'Tis done, if you but deign to aid the cause, Success is certain, blest with your applause. [That minstrel wakes the song in vain] That minstrel wakes the song in vain, Who weaves no moral with his strain; And he who flatters vice for pelf, Deserves its penalty himself. AN ADDRESS, Intended to have been spoken at the Park Theatre, for the Benefit of the Widow and Orphans of HOPKINS ROBERTSON. Patrons of worth—whose presence oft has graced The mental banquet here prepared for taste; But whose compassion led you here to-night, To make affliction's burthen sit more light— Deign to accept—'tis virtue's sweetest food, The widow's thanks—the orphan's gratitude. No visage, wet with artificial tears, No bosom, shook with counterfeited fears— No feign'd affliction—no fictitious grief, Now claim, from sympathizing hearts, relief. The tears, now shed, from real fountains spring,— The purest tribute gratitude can bring; The sighs now breathed, to Mercy's footstool bear, For you—and you—the widow's grateful prayer, The sweetest incense that to heaven ascends, To call down blessings on the orphan's friends. And the reward is yours—for sure, to-night, The happiest dreams will on your slumbers light: Fancy will paint a family of grief Receiving, from your generous hands, relief; And smiles shall greet you, from the humid eye Which your benevolence alone could dry. But yet—so well I know each generous heart,— You think this but a debt, discharged in part— A payment, to the offspring and the wife Of one who served you faithfully thro' life; Whose talents, labours, time—were all combined To please the fancy and improve the mind. Whether as monarch of these mimic realms, Or peasant, 'mid our canvas oaks and elms,— The hoary veteran, or the beardless lad— The lover happy—or, the tyrant mad!— In every character—or gay or grave— You can attest the pleasure that he gave. On life's great stage, he also play'd his part, Cheered by the plaudits of an honest heart; As husband, father, friend—his business ran— The citizen—the patriot—the man! In all, he acted well—yet, 'tis confess'd, One scene eclipsed in splendour all the rest: When hapless Richmond, on one funeral pyre, Saw beauty, talents, worth, and wealth, expire— When death abrupt on pleasure's precincts broke, And held his carnival 'mid flames and smoke; When shrieks of madness and despair, combined To freeze the blood, and agonize the mind— He stood undaunted, 'mid the unequal strife, Encountering death, to save another's life! Tho' blazing ruin revels o'er his head, Pouring a tempest on the quick and dead— Tho' thousand forked tongues of flame demand Their rescued victims from his daring hand— He still remains, the dreadful scene to brave, Till hope expires, and fate forbids to save! This to his fame the brightest ray has given, And called down blessings from approving heaven. But ah! the worth which you have all admired, With humbler virtues—tenderer, more retired— Could not avail from early death to save Him who had rescued other's from the grave. His part is o'er—the manly form, which trod These boards so oft, now sleeps beneath the sod; But the immortal mind, which never dies, To scenes more bright and permanent must rise; There enter on eternity's vast stage, And act an angel's part, an endless age. Your generous bounty cannot reach him there— But ah! he's left dear pledges to your care, Whose fate may e'en affect his bliss in heaven, As your protection is withheld or given. O then continue—as you do to-night, “To make affliction's burthen sit more light;” Protect the hapless orphan—shield the form Of widowed love, from misery's “pitiless storm;” So will you hear angelic lips applaud, And find the act itself a rich reward! EPILOGUE, To the Native Drama of “Narrah Mattah.” Spoken by Mrs. Sharpe, in the character of Narrah Mattah. The curtain's down—and while they're all behind Doffing their pilgrim dresses—I've a mind At the gay modern world to have one peep, And just say “how d'ye do?” before I sleep. (Looks round the boxes.) But how is this?—am I to understand That these are the descendants of that band Of pious plain-clad pilgrims, who came o'er To seek for freedom on this western shore? Why—where's the plain mob cap? the russet gown? The puritanic coat? the close-cropt crown? Where's all that neat simplicity of dress Which marked the puritans? Egad! I guess I wan't alone—more of them must have wed With native chiefs, and mingled white and red; Else why this taste for feathers, beads, and shells, In their descendants? Why do modern belles Paint their sweet faces, and from either ear Suspend those sparkling trinkets? And then here, (touching her own arm.) So modestly to bury half their charms, In those huge silken bags that hide their arms. O there's red blood in some of your blue veins, And so there is in yours, ye dapper swains, Or what's the meaning of those dandy chains Extending from your bosoms to your pockets? I wonder if you modern beaux wear lockets! Nay, hope not to escape me—you will fail, (laughing These treacherous square-toes, I shall know your trail. (Looks at the second tier.) I see you there, but I won't tell your name, He with the whiskers—yes—that's he—the same; A mighty chief of some great tribe, no doubt, You need not tell me—I shall make it out: Yes, yes—I see—it plainly now appears, Those artificial whiskers hide long ears! But he with that blue blanket on one shoulder, And feathered lip, must be a chief still bolder; Perhaps a sachem, sagamore, or scribe, O, I perceive, he's of the cockney tribe. (Looks at the third tier.) But what is that thing?—yonder—up above? He with the eye-glass? There! he's dropt his glove; What tribe claims him—or it—that taper shape? I've strong suspicions it must be the ape! You needn't smile, here, in the pit, below, For I've a word with you before I go. Yes, do smile! In mercy don't look grave, For 'tis your tribe must either damn or save The little bantling just gone off the stage. Forget its faults, but not its tender age. What if it be a little rude and wild, Remember that a parent loves his child: And I'll be sworn he's somewhere here to-night, With feelings none can know but they who write. So be good-natured, now, ye critic tribe; Nay, do not frown—can I not name some bribe? Yes, here it goes—don't let the new play fall, And Narrah Mattah vows to kiss you all. [Great applause. 'Tis safe!—'tis safe!—your generous hands decide it. There—take a kiss among you, and divide it. [Kisses her hand, and exit. TO CAPT. J. B. AND LADY, ON THE DEATH OF THEIR THIRD AND LAST REMAINING CHILD. “Insatiate archer! could not one suffice! Thy shaft flew THRICE, and thrice my peace was slain!” Young. Weep on, bereaved ones—there's no sin in tears, When nature's tenderest ties by death are broken, For He who pities while he chastens, hears The sigh of sorrow, as submission's token; And He remembers, too, when Lazarus slept, His own divine compassion—“Jesus wept!” Weep on—but mourn not with a hopeless sorrow, Raise your moist eyes to scenes beyond the grave, And own that He, from whom each bliss we borrow, Takes back in mercy, what his mercy gave: He takes them home—'tis love's, not fate's, decree, That where our treasures are, our hearts may be. Weep on, bereaved ones—'twas for this your God Severed the ties that kept your hearts below; Thwart not his purpose, but revere the rod, And meekly kiss the hand that gave the blow: The keenest pangs are all in mercy given— Humility's the only path to heaven. Weep on—but waste not one delicious tear On the cold surface of their earthy bed; Your babes are risen—nought but dust is here, Why seek the living, then, among the dead? Their souls have risen, from the mouldering tomb, To scenes of bliss, where joys eternal bloom. Weep on—but, like a sunbeam in a shower, Let this bright truth—a ray of light from heaven, Shine through the gloom of sorrow's darkest hour, The smile of peace—the hope of sins forgiven: The sweet assurance, that the ties of love, Can ne'er be severed in the realms above. EPITAPH. O that the icy touch of death should blight, Just in the bloom of youth, a form so bright; When smiling hope illumed a cultured mind, Rich in endowments of the fairest kind! By all respected, by the good approved, By kindred hearts, how tenderly beloved! Yet, cease to mourn—for virtue cannot die— The youth still lives in realms beyond the sky. MASONIC ODE. Intended for the opening of the grand Gothic Saloon, in the new Masonic Hall. When the great Architect of heaven and earth, Spoke this magnific system into birth, And bade its numerous orbs in order roll, To perfect wide creation's wondrous plan, He breathed his own pure spirit into man, And man became a living soul; Lord of the fair elysian fields he trod, An image and a likeness of his God; Designed, by wisdom infinite, to be A living temple of the Deity; An earthly palace, where would deign to dwell A guest divine, of name ineffable! But, love of self, a wily serpent, stole Into the sacred precincts of the soul, And tempted man to taste and eat The specious, fair, forbidden fruit of pride, Which heavenly love in mercy had denied; By which offence, He lost the Eden of his innocence, And fled, an exile, from the blissful seat. The hallowed mental temple thus became A mass of shapeless ruins, where Eternal Truth no more inscribed His name, A den of thieves, and not a house of prayer. 'Twas to rebuild this miniature of heaven, This temple of Jehovah in the mind, That the eternal three-fold Word was given, And our symbolic mystic ART design'd. For this, confiding Faith, and smiling Hope, With sweet celestial Charity, appear'd; Wisdom, and Strength, and Beauty, join'd the group, And each a column of the fabric rear'd; Surmounted by the royal-arch above, Join'd by the key-stone of celestial love. The work completed, on this heavenly plan, His tabernacle is again with man. As an auxiliar in this glorious cause, Our fellow-craft have reared this gothc pile, Sacred to pure Benevolence, whose laws Of mutual kindness light a blissful smile In sorrow's dewy eye. This splendid dome Shall never echo an unheeded sigh, For Charity, descending from the sky, Claims the proud fabric as her future home, Her earthly temple, where her blazing shrine Glows with a light that never shall decline, Till thousands yet unborn, admiring see And own the peerless worth of Masonry. EPITAPH. He is not here, but risen—wherefore shed Affliction's tear, or seek among the dead For one that lives, and claims immortal youth, With all the bliss that flows from love and truth? Grieve not for dust—nor let one sigh alloy A new-made angel's ecstasy of joy.</field>
