      <field name="fulltext">GOD'S CONTROVERSY WITH NEW-ENGLAND. Written in the time of the great drought Anno 1662. BY A LOVER OF NEW ENGLAND'S PROSPERITY. Isaiah, 5. 4. What could have been done more to my vineyard that I have not done in it? wherefore when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wilde grapes? THE AUTHORS REQUEST UNTO THE READER. Good christian Read? judge me not As too censorious, For pointing at those faults of thine Which are notorious. For if those faults be none of thine I do not thee accuse: But if they be, to hear thy faults Why shouldest thou refuse. I blame not thee to spare my self: But first at home begin, And judge my self, before that I Reproove anothers sin. Nor is it I that thee reproove Let God himself be heard Whose awfull providence's voice No man may disregard. Quod Deus omnipotens regali voce minatur, Quod tibi proclamant uno simul ore prophetæ, Quodq' ego cum lachrymis testor de numinis irâ, Tu leve co?ent? ne ducas, Lector Amice. NEW-ENGLAND PLANTED, PROSPERED, DECLINING, THREATNED, PUNISHED. Beyond the great Atlantick flood There is a region vast, A country where no English foot In former ages past: A waste and howling wilderness, Where none inhabited But hellish fiends, and brutish men That Devils worshiped. This region was in darkness plac't Far off from heavens light, Amidst the shaddows of grim death And of eternal night. For there the Sun of righteousness Had never made to shine The light of his sweet countenance, And grace which is divine: Until the time drew nigh wherein The glorious Lord of hostes Was pleasd to lead his armies forth Into those forrein coastes. At whose approach the darkness sad Soon vanished away, And all the shaddows of the night Were turnd to lightsome day. The dark and dismal western woods (The Devils den whilere) Beheld such glorious gospel-shine, As none beheld more cleare. Where sathan had his scepter sway'd For many generations, The King of Kings set up his throne To rule amongst the nations. The stubborn he in pieces brake, Like vessels made of clay: And those that sought his peoples hurt He turned to decay. Those curst Amalekites, that first Lift up their hand on high To fight against Gods Israel, Were ruin'd fearfully. Thy terrours on the Heathen folk, O Great Jehovah, fell: The fame of thy great acts, o Lord, Did all the nations quell. Some hid themselves for fear of thee In forrests wide &amp; great: Some to thy people croutching came, For favour to entreat. Some were desirous to be taught The knowledge of thy wayes, And being taught, did soon accord Therein to spend their dayes. Thus were the fierce &amp; barbarous Brought to civility, And those that liv'd like beasts (or worse) To live religiously. O happiest of dayes wherein The blind received sight, And those that had no eyes before Were made to see the light! The wilderness hereat rejoyc't, The woods for joy did sing, The vallys &amp; the little hills Thy praises ecchoing. Here was the hiding place, which thou, Jehovah, didst provide For thy redeemed ones, and where Thou didst thy jewels hide In per'lous times, and saddest dayes Of sack-cloth and of blood, When th'overflowing scourge did pass Through Europe, like a flood. While almost all the world beside Lay weltring in their gore: We, only we, enjoyd such peace As none enjoyd before. No forrein foeman did us fray, Nor threat'ned us with warrs: We had no enemyes at home, Nor no domestick jarrs. The Lord had made (such was his grace) For us a Covenant Both with the men, and with the beasts, That in this desart haunt: So that through places wilde and waste A single man, disarm'd, Might journey many hundred miles, And not at all be harm'd. Amidst the solitary woods Poor travellers might sleep As free from danger as at home, Though no man watch did keep. Thus were we priviledg'd with peace, Beyond what others were. Truth, Mercy, Peace, with Righteousness, Took up their dwelling here. Our Governo? was of our selves, And all his Bretheren, For wisdom &amp; true piety, Select, &amp; chosen men. Who, Ruling in y? fear of God, The righteous cause maintained, And all injurious violence, And wickedness, restrained. Our temp'rall blessings did abound: But spirituall good things Much more abounded, to the praise Of that great King of Kings. Gods throne was here set up; here was His tabernacle pight: This was the place, and these the folk In whom he took delight. Our morning starrs shone all day long: Their beams gave forth such light, As did the noon-day sun abash, And 's glory dazle quite. Our day continued many yeers, And had no night at all: Yea many thought the light would last, And be perpetuall. Such, o New-England, was thy first, Such was thy best estate: But, Loe! a strange and suddain change My courage did amate. The brightest of our morning starrs Did wholly disappeare: And those that tarried behind With sack-cloth covered were. Moreover, I beheld &amp; saw Our welkin overkest, And dismal clouds for sun-shine late O'respread from east to west. The air became tempestuous; The wilderness gan quake: And from above with awfull voice Th'Almighty thundring spake. Are these the men that erst at my command Forsook their ancient seats and native soile, To follow me into a desart land, Contemning all the travell and the toile, Whose love was such to purest ordinances As made them set at nought their fair inheritances? Are these the men that prized libertee To walk with God according to their light, To be as good as he would have them bee, To serve and worship him with all their might, Before the pleasures which a fruitfull field, And country flowing-full of all good things, could yield, Are these the folk whom from the brittish Iles, Through the stern billows of the watry main, I safely led so many thousand miles, As if their journey had been through a plain? Whom having from all enemies protected, And through so many deaths and dangers well directed, I brought and planted on the western shore, Where nought but bruits and salvage wights did swarm (Untaught, untrain'd, untam'd by vertue's lore) That sought their blood, yet could not do them harm? My fury's flaile them thresht, my fatall broom Did sweep them hence, to make my people elbow-room. Are these the men whose gates with peace I crown'd, To whom for bulwarks I salvation gave, Whilst all things else with rattling tumults sound, And mortall frayes send thousands to the grave? Whilest their own brethren bloody hands embrewed In brothers blood, and fields with carcases bestrewed? Is this the people blest with bounteous store, By land and sea full richly clad and fed, Whom plenty's self stands waiting still before, And powreth out their cups well tempered? For whose dear sake an howling wildernes I lately turned into a fruitfull paradeis? Are these the people in whose hemisphere Such bright-beam'd, glist'ring, sun-like starrs I placed, As by their influence did all things cheere, As by their light blind ignorance defaced, As errours into lurking holes did fray, As turn'd the late dark night into a lightsome day? Are these the folk to whom I milked out And sweetnes stream'd from consolations brest; Whose soules I fed and strengthened throughout With finest spirituall food most finely drest? On whom I rained living bread from Heaven, Withouten Errour's bane, or Superstition's leaven? With whom I made a Covenant of peace, And unto whom I did most firmly plight My faithfulness, If whilst I live I cease To be their Guide, their God, their full delight; Since them with cords of love to me I drew, Enwrapping in my grace such as should them ensew. Are these the men, that now mine eyes behold, Concerning whom I thought, and whilome spake, First Heaven shall pass away together scrold, Ere they my lawes and righteous wayes forsake, Or that they slack to runn their heavenly race? Are these the same? or are some others come in place? If these be they, how is it that I find In stead of holiness Carnality, In stead of heavenly frames an Earthly mind, For burning zeal luke-warm Indifferency, For flaming love, key-cold Dead-heartedness, For temperance (in meat, and drinke, and cloaths) excess? Whence cometh it, that Pride, and Luxurie Debate, Deceit, Contention, and Strife, False-dealing, Covetousness, Hypocrisie (With such like Crimes) amongst them are so rife, That one of them doth over-reach another? And that an honest man can hardly trust his Brother? How is it, that Security, and Sloth, Amongst the best are Common to be found? That grosser sins, in stead of Graces growth, Amongst the many more and more abound? I hate dissembling shews of Holiness. Or practise as you talk, or never more profess. Judge not, vain world, that all are hypocrites That do profess more holiness then thou: All foster not dissembling, guilefull sprites, Nor love their lusts, though very many do. Some sin through want of care and constant watch, Some with the sick converse, till they the sickness catch. Some, that maintain a reall root of grace, Are overgrown with many noysome weeds, Whose heart, that those no longer may take place, The benefit of due correction needs. And such as these however gone astray I shall by stripes reduce into a better way. Moreover some there be that still retain Their ancient vigour and sincerity; Whom both their own, and others sins, constrain To sigh, and mourn, and weep, and wail, &amp; cry: And for their sakes I have forborn to powre My wrath upon Revolters to this present houre. To praying Saints I always have respect, And tender love, and pittifull regard: Nor will I now in any wise neglect Their love and faithfull service to reward; Although I deal with others for their folly, And turn their mirth to tears that have been too jolly. For thinke not, O Backsliders, in your heart, That I shall still your evill manners beare: Your sinns me press as sheaves do load a cart, And therefore I will plague you for this geare Except you seriously, and soon, repent, Ile not delay your pain and heavy punishment. And who be those themselves that yonder shew? The seed of such as name my dreadfull Name! On whom whilere compassions skirt I threw Whilest in their blood they were, to hide their shame! Whom my preventing love did neer me take! Whom for mine own I mark't, lest they should me forsake! I look't that such as these to vertue's Lore (Though none but they) would have Enclin'd their ear: That they at least mine image should have bore, And sanctify'd my name with awfull fear. Let pagan's Bratts pursue their lusts, whose meed Is Death: For christians children are an holy seed. But hear O Heavens! Let Earth amazed stand; Ye Mountaines melt, and Hills come flowing down: Let horro? seize upon both Sea and Land; Let Natures self be cast into a stown. I children nourisht, nurtur'd and upheld: But they against a tender father have rebell'd. What could have been by me performed more? Or wherein fell I short of your desire? Had you but askt, I would have op't my store, And given what lawfull wishes could require. For all this bounteous cost I lookt to see Heaven-reaching-hearts, &amp; thoughts, Meekness, Humility. But lo, a sensuall Heart all void of grace, An Iron neck, a proud presumptuous Hand; A self-conceited, stiff, stout, stubborn Race, That fears no threats, submitts to no command: Self-will'd, perverse, such as can beare no yoke; A Generation even ripe for vengeance stroke. Such were that Carnall Brood of Israelites That Josua and the Elders did ensue, Who growing like the cursed Cananites Upon themselves my heavy judgements drew. Such also was that fleshly Generation, Whom I o'rewhelm'd by waters deadly inundation. They darker light, and lesser meanes misused; They had not such Examples them to warn: You clearer Rules, and Precepts, have abused, And dreadfull monuments of others harm. My gospels glorious light you do not prize: My Gospels endless, boundless grace you clean despize. My painfull messengers you disrespect, Who toile and sweat and sweale themselves away, Yet nought at all with you can take effect, Who hurrie headlong to yo? own decay. In vain the Founder melts, and taketh pains: Bellows and Lead's consum'd, but still your dross remains. What should I do with such a stiff-neckt race? How shall I ease me of such Foes as they? What shall befall despizers of my Grace? I'le surely beare their candle-stick away, And Lamps put out. Their glorious noon-day light I'le quickly turn into a dark Egyptian night. Oft have I charg'd you by my ministers To gird your selves with sack cloth, and repent. Oft have I warnd you by my messengers; That so you might my wrathfull ire prevent: But who among you hath this warning taken? Who hath his crooked wayes, &amp; wicked works forsaken? Yea many grow to more and more excess; More light and loose, more Carnall and prophane. The sins of Sodom, Pride, and Wantonness, Among the multitude spring up amain. Are these the fruits of Pious Education, To run with greater speed and Courage to Damnation? If here and there some two, or three, shall steere A wiser course, then their Companions do, You make a mock of such; and scoff, and jeere Becaus they will not be so bad as you. Such is the Generation that succeeds The men, whose eyes have seen my great &amp; awfull deeds. Now therefore hearken and encline yo? ear, In judgement I will henceforth with you plead; And if by that you will not learn to fear, But still go on a sensuall life to lead: I'le strike at once an All-Consuming stroke; Nor cries nor tears shall then my fierce intent revoke. Thus ceast his Dreadful-threatning voice The High &amp; lofty-One. The Heavens stood still Appal'd thereat; The Earth beneath did groane: Soon after I beheld and saw A mortall dart come flying: I lookt again, &amp; quickly saw Some fainting, others dying. The Heavens more began to lowre, The welkin Blacker grew: And all things seemed to forebode Sad changes to ensew. From that day forward hath the Lord Apparently contended With us in Anger, and in Wrath: But we have not amended. Our healthfull dayes are at an end, And sicknesses come on From yeer to yeer, becaus o? hearts Away from God are gone. New-England, where for many yeers You scarcely heard a cough, And where Physicians had no work, Now finds them work enough. Now colds and coughs, Rhewms, and sore-throats, Do more &amp; more abound: Now Agues sore &amp; Feavers strong In every place are found. How many houses have we seen Last Autumn, and this spring, Wherein the healthful were too few To help the languishing. One wave another followeth, And one disease begins Before another cease, becaus We turn not from our sins. We stopp our ear against reproof, And hearken not to God: God stops his ear against o? prayer, And takes not off his rod. Our fruitful seasons have been turnd Of late to barrenness, Sometimes through great &amp; parching drought, Sometimes through rain's excess. Yea now the pastures &amp; corn fields For want of rain do languish: The cattell mourn, &amp; hearts of men Are fill'd with fear &amp; anguish. The clouds are often gathered, As if we should have rain: But for o? great unworthiness Are scattered again. We pray &amp; fast, &amp; make fair shewes, As if we meant to turn: But whilst we turn not, God goes on Our field, &amp; fruits to burn. And burnt are all things in such sort, That nothing now appears, But what may wound our hearts with grief, And draw foorth floods of teares. All things a famine do presage In that extremity, As if both men, and also beasts, Should soon be done to dy. This O New-England hast thou got By riot, &amp; excess: This hast thou brought upon thy self By pride &amp; wantonness. Thus must thy worldlyness be whipt. They, that too much do crave, Provoke the Lord to take away Such blessings as they have. We have been also threatened With worser things then these: And God can bring them on us still, To morrow if he please. For if his mercy be abus'd, Which holpe us at our need And mov'd his heart to pitty us, We shall be plagu'd indeed. Beware, O sinful Land, beware; And do not think it strange That sorer judgements are at hand, Unless thou quickly change. Or God, or thou, must quickly change; Or else thou art undon: Wrath cannot cease, if sin remain, Where judgement is begun. Ah dear New England! dearest land to me; Which unto God hast hitherto been dear, And mayst be still more dear than formerlie, If to his voice thou wilt incline thine ear. Consider wel &amp; wisely what the rod, Wherewith thou art from yeer to yeer chastized, Instructeth thee. Repent, &amp; turn to God, Who wil not have his nurture be despized. Thou still hast in thee many praying saints, Of great account, and precious with the Lord, Who dayly powre out unto him their plaints, And strive to please him both in deed &amp; word. Cheer on, sweet souls, my heart is with you all, And shall be with you, maugre Sathan's might: And whereso'ere this body be a Thrall, Still in New-England shall be my delight.</field>
