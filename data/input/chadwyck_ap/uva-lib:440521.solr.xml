      <field name="fulltext">THE SISTER'S FAREWELL TO THE SAILOR-BOY. Since where waves are gliding And the tall ship riding Thou dost choose to dwell, Where the sea-bird screameth, And the bright flag gleameth, Brother, fare thee well. Where the orchard shineth, Where the grape-vine twineth, Or the nut-tree laden, Thou, while song-birds waken, Hast with strong arm shaken For some bright-eyed maiden,â Where in summer weather, Oft we 've played together, 'Neath the old oak tree, With our dog beside us, While no sorrow tried us, I'll remember thee. Where the brook is sheenest, And the leaves are greenest, In the forest fair, With a sad emotion, Rover of the ocean, I shall miss thee there. When dark skies are pouring, And loud tempests roaring, Sea-boy, wilt thou be High among the shrouds, Wet by dripping clouds, Thinking then of me? Should temptations try thee, Bid the evil fly thee, Making God thy guide: Dearest sailor brother, Let us love each other, Whatsoe'er betide. Heavy night-winds swelling Round our quiet dwelling, Shall thy form restore: Thinking of the billow, On my restless pillow, I'll for thee implore. Oh God! to whom we cried Our cradle beds beside, When life was free from pain; From the storms above him, To the hearts that love him, Bring him safe again. TOM HARDY. Tom Hardy was a merry lad, His pleasant face made others glad, Like suns that cloudless shine; Aloft he ran with right good will, The topsail reefed with ready skill, And snugly clewed the line. Obedient still at every call, And friendly to his messmates all, For others' pain he felt; And ever neatest of the crew, On Sundays, in his jacket blue, At morning prayers he knelt. No draught he took to cheer his mind, The temperance pledge he early signed, Nor from that promise roved; In every duty free from blame, Blow high, blow low, 'twas all the same, Still happy and beloved. But once, upon a sickly shore, The burning fever smote him sore, And when we shipped again, Still to his sad disease a prey, He wasted like the snow away, And all our care was vain. So, with weak hand, he took the key From out his chest, and gave it me: âThis to my mother take, My little all to her I leave, And tell her not too much to grieve, For her lost sea-boy's sake. Here is the Bible that she gave, It was my compass on the wave When prosperous skies were fair; And now, when darksome billows roll, It is an anchor to my soul, That drives away despair. Cut from my temples, when I'm dead, A curling lock of hair, he said, For my sweet Mary dear: I know she'll truly mourn for me, Who slumber in the far, deep sea, No more her voice to hear. And now, my peace with God is made, So, not of the last foe afraid, I meet a watery grave; For near me, with an outstretched hand, I see my blest Redeemer stand, My parting soul to save.â Bright rose the morn, but cold as lead Lay poor Tom Hardy, pale and dead; Though yet a smile of joy Sate on his face, while sad and true The roughest tar amid the crew Mourned for the sailor-boy. Now, sometimes while my watch I keep At lonely midnight, on the deep, When all is calm and clear, I seem to hear his well-known voice, âOh messmate, make your God your choice, And to His haven steer.â THE WHALER'S SONG. There she lies!âThere she lies! Like a mountain-isle on Ocean's breast. âWhere away?â Just three points west, Where the white surge meets the skies. Head the vessel! Trim the sail! Let us see this mighty whale. There she blows!âThere she blows! Man the boats! for nothing stay! Such a prize we cannot lose, Stretch to your oars! away! away! Grapple closer, careful steer, Launch the harpoon, laugh at fear, Plunge it deep, the barbed spear, Strike the lance, in swift career, Give her line! Give her line! Down she goes, through the foaming brine, Sponge the side, where the flying coil Marks the monster's speed and toil; But though she dives to the deepest ground, Which the plummet fails to sound, 'Tis all in vain! All in vain! She hath that within her side, Will surely bring her up again. Spout! Spout! Spout! The waves are maddening all about, Every billow on its head Strangely wears a crest of red; How she lashes the seething main, In her flurry and her pain; Take good heed, my hearts of oak, Of her terrible flukes, as she tortured lies, Lest they hurl us to the skies: But lo! the pride of her strength is broke, Heavy she lies, as a mass of lead, The mighty-monarch whale is dead! Row! Row! Row! In our ship she must go, Changed by fire to a liquid stream, Over the broad Pacific's swell, Round Cape Horn, where the tempests dwell, Many a night and many a day, Home with us, she must sail away, Till we joyful hail once more, Old Nantucket's treeless shore; There when the fair whom we love to please, Sit by the fireside at their ease, Let them remember, if they will, The hardy tar, who on seas afar Risked his life their lamp to fill. CHILD IN A STORM. The good ship o'er the ocean, Glides on, where skies are bright, And rolling waves right merrily Propel her homeward flight; But lo! the angry tempests Rush from their prisoning cell, The rocky coast frowns dark and dread, The wintry surges swell. 'T is night! Amid the breakers The headlong vessel goes, And shrieking, like a wounded man, Strives with her vengeful foes; Pale grows the boldest mariner, For scarce the trumpet's cry Is heard amid contending blasts, Whose warfare shakes the sky. How fearful is the tumult, The cry, the wail, the prayer, Wild mingling with the deafening storm In echoes of despair: But in the lowly cabin, Rocked by the raging sea, There calmly sat a beauteous boy, Upon his mother's knee. He sang a hymn of heaven, Then spoke so sweetly mild, âThe Bible saith our Saviour dear Doth love the little child; It telleth of a happy home Beyond the stormy sky; Mother! He'll take us there to dwell, We're not afraid to die.â His smile was pure and peaceful As the pearl beneath the deep, When the booming battle thunders, Across its bosom sweep; Hoarse came the words of horror From men of sinful life, While innocence, with soul serene, Beheld the appalling strife. Morn! Morn!âThe clouds are breaking, The tempest's wrath is o'er, The shattered bark moves heavily To reach the welcome shore; Hushed is the voice of thunder, And quelled the lightning's flame, For prayer had touched the gate of heaven, And listening Mercy came. HOMEWARD BOUND. Hail distant mountain! rearing dim O'er my loved land, thy lofty head, How welcome is thy sight to him So long by chart and compass led; Speck though thou art, and wrapped in haze, Right pleasant 't is on thee to gaze. I 've marked the lordly Teneriffe Rise with rough forehead from the sea, Gay songsters warbling round the cliff, Rich strains of dulcet melody; Yet rather would my longing ear The wild birds of my country hear. I 've sailed where Chimborazo towers Amid old Andes' giant chain, And where the bright Brazilian flowers Pour living fragrance o'er the plain; But sweeter is the clustering vine That doth my lowly porch entwine. I 've roamed where Himmaleh aspires With snowy crest o'er Indian vales, And where perfumed from spicy groves The freighted vessel fills her sails; But dearer far yon mountain hoar, Blest herald of my native shore. THE HEROIC SAILOR. The circumstances here related, took place during the great fire in the city of New York, on the night of December 16th, 1836. It was a fearful night! The fire devouring spread From roof to roof, from street to street, And on their treasures fed; Hark! 't is a mother's cry, Shrill mid the tumult wild, As rushing toward her flame-wrapped home, She shrieks, âMy child! my child!â A wanderer from the wave, A sailor marked her woe, And in his feeling bosom woke The sympathetic glow,â Quick up the cleaving stairs, With daring step he flew, Though sable clouds of stifling smoke Concealed him from their view. The astonished crowd beheld His bold, adventurous part, And while they for his safety feared, Admired his noble heart,â For blazing timbers fell To choke his dangerous road, And the far chamber where he groped Like reeking oven glowed. How loud the exulting shout! When from that mass of flame, Unhurt, unshrinking, undismayed, The brave deliverer came,â While in his victor arms A smiling infant lay, Pleased with the flash that round his bed Had wound its glittering ray. The mother's speechless tears Forth like a torrent sped, Yet ere the throng could learn his name That generous hero fled; Not for the praise of man He wrought this deed of love, But on a bright, unfading page, 'T is registered above. THOUGHTS OF HOME A home I have on land, A humble one, and low, But there my best beloved friend Remembereth me, I know; And she will teach, with glowing cheek Our babe its father's name to speak. I keep my lonely watch At midnight's solemn hour, And when the rushing waves go by With wild resistless power, A spirit whispereth from their foam, âO Sailor! Sailor! welcome home!â 'T is often in my thoughts, That quiet home and fair, And in my sea-rocked dream I see The infant sleeping there; And tears that from his mother's eye Gushed when I bade them both good bye. Upon their love I muse, When wrathful tempests roar, And heavenward lift the earnest prayer, To see their face once more; And joyful join the happy band Whose home is in my native land. HOPE IN GOD. Appear for my defence, my God, And let thy shield be spread Around the sailor's lonely heart, And unprotected head. Thine are the ocean and the land, And man's frail dying race, While those who walk in pride, thy hand Is able to abase. Let not my hope in thee be crossed, Who have no help beside, Nor on the winds my prayer be lost, Thou Everlasting Guide! But bid thy mercy and thy love Encompass me around, And thoughts of heavenly comfort prove A balm for every wound. Uphold me in temptation's field, Where I am called to go, Nor let my feeble spirit yield To earthly sin and woe. For though the wildest storms may rise, And darkness rule the sphere, The hope that anchors in the skies Hath nought to do with fear. LESSON OF THE SEA. Go down unto the sea, Where white-winged navies ride, Whose mighty pulses heave so free In strong, mysterious tide; Deep in whose coral-cells Where sunless forests weep, So many a wandering child of earth Hath laid him down to sleep. Go forth upon the sea, And at the break of morn, Teach its young waves the words of prayer, Before the day is born; And when the night grows dim, Beguile the billows wild, With the holy hush of thine evening-hymn, As the mother lulls her child. Go, bow thee to the sea, When the heavy breakers roar, And a meek-hearted listener be To all their fearful lore; And learn when tempests lower The lesson of the wave, âOne Voice alone can curb our power, One Arm alone can save.â Go homeward from the sea, When its trial-hour is past, With deeper trust in Him who rules The billow and the blast; And should the charms of earth Around thy bosom creep, Forget not in thine hour of mirth The wisdom of the deep. LINES TO THE AUTHOR OF âTHIRTY YEARS FROM HOME.â Son of the Sea! through many a clime Hardship and toil have marked thy way The thundering battle steeped in blood, And the wild tempest's fearful sway. But now, thy peaceful hearth beside, Thy happier lot it is to see Domestic comfort flourish fair, And yield its cherished fruits to thee. Forget not in thy daily prayer To praise the Hand that safely led Thee through the perils of the wave, And snares of sin thy path that spread. Son of the Sea! thy choice is made, Fast by thy Saviour's cross to cling; So mayst thou reach His haven blest, And join the triumphs of thy King. DRINKING SONG. Drink, friends, the parting hour draws nigh, Drink, and forget your care, The sultry summer-noon is high, Drink, and your strength repair; The farmer with his toil-brown hands, The soldier, tired of slaughter, The camel mid the burning sands, Drink deep the crystal water. Our father Sun the example gives, Our mother Earth also; He, jocund drinks, above the cloud, She, thirsting, drinks below: Drink friends, drink deep, before we part, To loving wife, or daughter, Or bright-eyed maid who rules your heart, Drink deep, but only water. âI WENT TO SEA.â I am a sailor, rough and bold, And yet my boyhood fair, Was nurtured in a pleasant home, By parents' tender care; But at their hearth or by their side I had no mind to be, E'er since I heard a story told Of one who went to sea. I sat in school, but book and rule Still no instruction brought, The snowy sail and foaming flood So filled my roving thought; And when on quiet pillow laid, There was no rest for me, For every fleeting vision sung The music of the sea. My father bade me learn a trade, Or till the fallow land, And told how healthful toil would heap The silver in my hand; But when he died, I felt, alas! From all allegiance free, And though my widowed mother wept, I left her for the sea. I 've sailed where arctic oceans spread, And icy mountains frown, And the fierce fire of tropic suns Hath burnt my forehead brown; I 've sailed among the Indian isles, Where grows the spicy tree, And where the broad La Plata rolls, Rich tribute to the sea. I 've climbed the shroud when storms blew loud, And every star was dead, And winter in the midnight cloud Had muffled up her head; I 've seen our good ship go to wreck, For such was heaven's decree, And in the boat, mid breakers white, Have dared the raging sea. Yet still that Pilot, who the helm Of this round world doth guide, Preserved me when the jaws of death Were yawning dark and wide; Though when the blast was safely past Too oft in sailor glee, This too ungrateful heart forget The Ruler of the sea. But, blessed day! a holy man To me a Bible gave, That life-boat to the struggling wretch, Who darkly beats the wave; And now its blest and warning voice, Doth speak good words to me, Whene'er my midnight watch I keep Upon the lonely sea. And then, my mother's image comes So pitiful and meek, As when with streaming eyes she stood Her last farewell to speak; When from her pleasant cottage door I made such haste to flee, And in my wilful mood forsook Her kindness for the sea. That Book divine, which bids us shun The dread undying flame, Doth strictly for our parent-guides, A filial reverence claim; But mother, mother, kind and dear, How have I honored thee? With many a pang I paid thy love, Before I went to sea. God give me grace to see her face, And sooth her sorrowing care, And freely with her feeble age My honest pittance share; And once more bending by her side, On the repentant knee, Hear her fond lips rejoicing bless The wanderer from the sea. THE SAILOR'S SICK CHILD. Come, mother, sit beside my bed, And of my father tell, On the deep ocean far away, Where foaming billows swell; I wish that he were with us now, While sick and faint I lie, 'T were good to hear his loving voice, And bless him ere I die. Mother, it troubles me to see Those stranger-ladies come, And urge you so to leave my side, And work for them, at home; Methinks they coldly gaze on me, And shake their heads, and say, How feeble and how pale I grow, And waste, and waste away. And oh, it grieves my heart to think, From morn to evening shade, That you so oft for them must toil, And have from me no aid; And then, with tender words, you say, You wish it were not so, But I should have no food or fire, Unless you sometimes go. When slow the sunset fades away, And twilight mists appear, The sound of your returning step Is music to my ear; How happy are those children dear, Who, on their couch of pain, Behold a mother always near, But still, I'll not complain. There 's nought on earth I love so much As your dear face to see, And now, indeed, the time is short We can together be; Still draw me closer to your side, And to your bosom fold, For then my cough I do not heed, Nor feel the winter's cold. Yet when the storm is loud and wild, I cover up my head, And pray Almighty God to save My father from the dead; So, in his lonely midnight watch Upon the tossing sea, Perhaps beneath the solemn stars He will remember me. I know I cannot see him more, I feel it must be so, But he can find my little grave, Where early spring flowers blow; And you will comfort all his cares, When I in heaven shall be; But mother, dearest! when I die, Oh! be alone with me. HYMN FOR THANKSGIVING DAY. Sung by sailors, at their boarding-house in New York, on Thanksgiving day, 1844. Sons of the boisterous sea, With grateful hearts we share The blessings of this happy land, Which heaven hath made its care;â Whose glorious flag is borne High o'er the ocean's breast, Whose strong-winged eagle proudly makes Among the stars his nest. Not with the cup that drains Our best resolves away, And leaves its poison in our veins, We keep the feast to-day. But from the hateful cloud Of dark intemperance free, We praise the Giver of our joys, Who ruleth land and sea;â Who saved us when the surge Rolled high in threatening pride, And from the shipwreck and the blast, When many a comrade died. And if in Christian love His precepts we obey, The whole of future life may prove One blest Thanksgiving day. PRAYER IN SICKNESS. Oh Thou, whose healing touch So oft the sick did save, When thou didst dwell with men below, And tread the raging wave; In weakness and in woe, I bow my dropping head, Oh! give the pitying angels charge To watch my lonely bed. Be with me, while the hours In speechless suffering roll, And make each pain a teacher, Lord, Unto my sinful soul. Should vigorous health once more Reanimate my frame, Inspire me with a purer zeal To glorify Thy name. Thy precepts to obey My roving heart incline, And grant that both in life and death Thy holy will be mine. DELIVERANCE FROM DANGER. Ruler of the earth and sky, Who the mighty deep doth hold In the hollow of Thy hand, By thy slightest word controlled; Who the stormy winds dost curb, Rushing on their midnight path, And the reeling vessel save From the tempest of their wrath; Thou from shipwreck and despair Didst our souls in safety set, When all human help was vain, May we ne'er thy love forget; Ne'er the tender mercy grieve That upheld us when we prayed, Nor the sacred promise break That in danger's hour we made.</field>
