      <field name="fulltext">TO HENRY B. STANTON THIS VOLUME IS INSCRIBED AS A TOKEN OF THE AUTHOR'S PERSONAL FRIENDSHIP, AND OF HIS RESPECT FOR THE UNRESERVED DEVOTION OF EXALTED TALENTS TO THE CAUSE OF HUMANITY AND FREEDOM LINES Written on reading âWright and Wrong in Boston;â containing an account of the meeting of the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society, and the MOB which followed, on the 21st of the 10th month, 1835. Unshrinking from the storm, Well have ye borne your part, With WOMAN'S fragile form, But more than manhood's heart! Faithful to Freedom, when Its name was held accursedâ Faithful, midst ruffian men, Unto your holy trust. Ohâsteadfast in the Truth! Not for yourselves alone, Matron and gentle youth, Your lofty zeal was shown: For the bondman of all climesâ For Freedom's last abodeâ For the hope of future timesâ For the birthright gift of Godâ For scorn'd and broken lawsâ For honor and the rightâ For the staked and peril'd cause Of liberty and lightâ For the holy eyes above On a world of evil castâ For the CHILDREN of your loveâ For the MOTHERS of the past! Worthy of THEM are yeâ The Pilgrim wives who dared The waste and unknown sea, And the hunter's perils shared. Worthy of her Mrs. Hutchinson, who was banished from the Massachusetts Colony, as the easiest method of confuting her doctrines. whose mind, Triumphant over all, Ruler nor priest could bind, Nor banishment appal. Worthy of her Mary Dyer, the Quaker Martyr, who was hanged in Boston, in 1659, for worshipping God according to the dictates of her conscience. who died Martyr of Freedom, where Your âCommons'â verdant pride, Opens to sun and air: Upheld at that dread hour By strength which could not fail; Before whose holy power Bigot and priest turn'd pale. God give ye strength to run, Unawed by Earth or Hell, The race ye have begun So gloriously and well, Until the trumpet-call Of Freedom has gone forth, With joy and life to all The bondmen of the earth! Until IMMORTAL MIND Unshackled walks abroad, And chains no longer bind The image of our God. Until no captive one Murmurs on land or wave; And, in his course, the sun Looks down upon no SLAVE! CHRIST IN THE TEMPEST. Storm on the heaving waters!âThe vast sky Is stooping with its thunder. Cloud on cloud Rolls heavily in the darkness, like a shroud Shaken by midnight's Angel from on high, Through the thick sea-mist, faintly and afar, Chorazin's watch-light glimmers like a star, And, momently, the ghastly cloud-fires play On the dark sea-wall of Capernaum's bay, And tower and turret into light spring forth Like spectres starting from the storm-swept earth; And, vast and awful, Tabor's mountain form, Its Titan forehead naked to the storm, Towers for one instant, full and clear, and then Blends with the blackness and the cloud again. And it is very terrible!âThe roar Ascendeth unto heaven, and thunders back, Like the response of demons, from the black Rifts of the hanging tempestâyawning o'er The wild waves in their torment. Hark!âthe cry Of strong man in peril, piercing through The uproar of the waters and the sky, As the rent bark one moment rides to view, On the tall billows, with the thunder cloud Closing around, above her, like a shroud! He stood upon the reeling deckâHis form Made visible by the lightning, and His brow Pale, and uncover'd to the rushing storm, Told of a triumph man may never knowâ Power underived and mightyââPeaceâBE STILL!â The great waves heard Him, and the storm's loud tone Went moaning into silence at His will; And the thick clouds, where yet the lightning shone, And slept the latent thunder, roll'd away, Until no trace of tempest lurk'd behind, Changing, upon the pinions of the wind, To stormless wanderers, beautiful and gay. Dread Ruler of the tempest! Thou before Whose presence boweth the uprisen stormâ To whom the waves do homage round the shore Of many an Island empire!âif the form Of the frail dust beneath Thine eye, may claim Thy infinite regardâoh, breathe upon The storm and darkness of man's soul the same Quiet, and peace, and humbleness which came O'er the roused waters, where Thy voice had gone A minister of powerâto conquer in Thy name! Look unto heaven! âKNOWEST THOU THE ORDINANCES OF HEAVEN?ââ Job xxxviii. 33. Look unto heaven! The still and solemn stars are burning there, Like altars lighted in the upper air, And to the worship of the great God given, Where the pure spirits of the unsinning dead, Redeem'd and sanctified from Earth, might shed The holiness of prayer. Look ye above! The Earth is glorious with its summer wreath; The tall trees bend with verdure; and, beneath, Young flowers are blushing like unwhisper'd love. Yet these will changeâEarth's glories be no more, And all her bloom and greenness fade before The ministry of Death. Then gaze not there. God's constant miracleâthe star-wrought sky Bends o'er ye, lifting silently on high, As with an Angel's hand, the soul of prayer; And Heaven's own language to the pure of Earth, Written in stars at Nature's mighty birth, Burns on the gazing eye. Oh! turn ye, then, And bend the knee of worship; and the eyes Of the pure stars shall smile, with glad surprise, At the deep reverence of the sons of men. Oh! bend in worship, till those stars grow dim, And the skies vanish, at the thought of Him Whose light beyond them lies! LINES, Written in the Common-place Book of a young lady. âWrite, write!â Dear Cousin, since thy word, Like that my ancient namesake heard On Patmos, may not be denied, I offer for thy page a lay Breathing of Beauty pass'd awayâ Of Grace and Genius, Love and Truth, All which can add a charm to youth, To Virtue and to Heaven allied. Forgive me, if the lay be such As may not suit thy hours of gladness; Forgive me, if it breathe too much Of mourning and of sadness. It may be well that tears, at whiles, Should take the place of Folly's smiles, When 'neath some Heaven-directed blow, Like those of Horeb's rock, they flow; For sorrows are in mercy given To fit the chasten'd soul for Heaven; Prompting, with woe and weariness, Our yearning for that better sky, Which, as the shadows close on this, Grows brighter to the longing eye. For each unwelcome blow may break, Perchance, some chain which binds us here; And clouds around the heart may make The vision of our Faith more clear; As through the shadowy veil of even The eye looks farthest into Heaven, On gleams of star and depths of blue The fervid sunshine never knew! ? âThe parted spirit, Knoweth it not our sorrow? Answereth not Its blessing to our tears?â The circle is brokenâone seat is forsaken,â One bud from the tree of our friendship is shakenâ One heart from among us no longer shall thrill With the spirit of gladness, or darken with ill. Weep!âLonely and lowly, are slumbering now The light of her glances, the pride of her brow. Weep!âSadly and long shall we listen in vain To hear the soft tones of her welcome again. Give our tears to the dead! For humanity's claim From its silence and darkness is ever the same; The hope of that World whose existence is bliss May not stifle the tears of the mourners of this. For, oh! if one glance the freed spirit can throw On the scene of its troubled probation below, Than the pride of the marbleâthe pomp of the deadâ To that glance will be dearer the tears which we shed. Oh, who can forget the rich light of her smile, Over lips moved with music and feeling the whileâ The eye's deep enchantment, dark, dream-like, and clear, In the glow of its gladnessâthe shade of its tear. And the charm of her features, while over the whole Play'd the hues of the heart and the sunshine of soul,â And the tones of her voice, like the music which seems Murmur'd low in our ears by the Angel of dreams! But holier and dearer our memories hold Those treasures of feeling, more precious than goldâ The love and the kindness,âthe pity which gave Fresh hopes to the living and wreaths for the graveâ The heart ever open to Charity's claim, Unmoved from its purpose by censure and blame, While vainly alike on her eye and her ear Fell the scorn of the heartless, the jesting and jeer. For, though spotless herself, she could sorrow for them Who sullied with evil the spirit's pure gem; And a sigh or a tear could the erring reprove, And the sting of reprof was still temper'd by love. As a cloud of the sunset, slow melting in heaven, As a star that is lost when the daylight is given, As a glad dream of slumber, which wakens in bliss, She hath pass'd to the world of the holy from this. She hath pass'd!âbut, oh! sweet as the flowrets that bloom From her last lonely dwellingâthe dust of her tombâ The charm of her virtues, as Heaven's own breath, Shall rise like an incense from darkness and death. THE CITY OF REFUGE. Joshua, chapter xx. âAway from thy people, thou shedder of bloodâ Away to the refuge appointed of God! Nay, pause not to look for thy household or kin, For Death is behind thee, thou worker of sin. âAway!âlook not back, though that sorrowful one, The mother who bore thee, shall wail for her son, Nor stay when thy wife, as a beautiful blossom, Shall clasp thy fair child to her desolate bosom. âAway, with thy face to the refuge afar In the glow of the sunâin the eye of the star; Though the Simoom breathe o'er thee, oppressive and warm, Rest not by the fountain nor under the palm. âAway! for the kinsman of him thou hast slain Has breathed on thy head the dark curses of Cain; The cry of his vengeance shall follow thy pathâ The tramp of his footstep, the shout of his wrath.â And the slayer sprang up as the warning was said, And the stones of the altar rang out to his tread; The wail of his household was lost on his earâ He spoke not, he paused not, he turn'd not to hear. He fled to the desertâhe turn'd him not back When the rush of the sand-storm grew loud in his track, Nor paused till his vision fell, grateful and glad, On the green hills of Gileadâthe white tents of Gad. Oh, thus, when the crimes and the errors of Earth Have driven her children as wanderers forth, To the bow'd and the broken of spirit is given The hope of a refugeâthe refuge of Heaven! LINES, Written on visiting a singular cave in Chester, N. H., known in the vicinity by the name of âThe Devil's Den.â The moon is bright on the rocky hill, But its dwarfish pines rise gloomily still,â Fix'd, motionless forms in the silent air, The moonlight is on them, but darkness is there. The drowsy flap of the owlet's wing, And the stream's low gush from its hidden spring, And the passing breeze, in its flight betray'd By the timid shiver of leaf and blade, Half like a sigh and half a moan, The ear of the listener catches alone. A dim cave yawns in the rude hill-side, Like the jaws of a monster open'd wide, Where a few wild bushes of thorn and fern Their leaves from the breath of the night-air turn; And half with twining foliage cover The mouth of that shadowy cavern over:â Above it, the rock rests gloomy and high Its rugged outline against the sky Which seems, as it opens on either hand, Like some bright sea leaving a desolate land. Below it, a stream on its bed of stone From a rift in the rock comes hurrying down, Telling for ever the same wild tale Of its loftier home to the lowly vale; And over its waters an oak is bending, Its boughs like a skeleton's arms extendingâ A naked tree, by the lightning shorn, With its trunk all bare and its branches torn; And the rocks beneath it, blacken'd and rent, Tell where the bolt of the thunder went. 'T is said that this cave is an evil placeâ The chosen haunt of the fallen race; That the midnight traveller oft hath seen A red flame tremble its jaws between, And lighten and quiver the boughs among, Like the fiery play of a serpent's tongue; That sounds of fear from its chambers swellâ The ghostly gibber, the fiendish yell; That bodiless hands at its entrance wave.â And hence they have named it THE Demon's Cave! The fears of man to this place have lent A terror which Nature never meant; For who hath wander'd, with curious eye, This dim and shadowy cavern by, And known, in the sun or star-light, aught Which might not beseem so lonely a spot,â The stealthy fox, and the shy raccoon, The night-bird's wing in the shining moon, The frog's low croak, and, upon the hill, The steady chant of the whippoorwill? Yet is there something to fancy dear In this silent cave and its lingering fear,â Something which tells of another age, Of the wizard's wand, and the Sybil's page, Of the fairy ring and the haunted glen, And the restless phantoms of murder'd men, The grandame's tale and the nurse's song, The dreams of childhood remember'd long; And I love even now to list the tale Of the Demon's Cave, and its haunted vale. SUICIDE POND. 'T is a dark and dismal little pool, and fed by tiny rills, And bosom'd in waveless quietude between two barren hills; There is no tree on its rugged marge, save a willow old and lone, Like a solitary mourner for its sylvan sisters gone. The plough of the farmer turneth not the sward of its gloomy shore, Which bears even now the same gray moss which in other times it bore; And seldom or never the tread of man is heard in that lonely spot, For with all the dwellers around that pool its story is unforgot. And why does the traveller turn aside from that dark and silent pool, Though the sun be burning above his head, and the willow's shade be cool? Or glance with fear to its shadowy brink, when night rests darkly there, And down, through its sullen and evil depths, the stars of the midnight glare? Merrily whistles the cow-boy onâbut he hushes his music when He hurries his cows, with a sidelong glance, from that cold forsaken glen! Laughing and mirthful the young girl comes, with her gamesome mates, from school, But her laugh is lost and her lip is white as she passes the haunted pool! 'T is said that a young, a beautiful girl, with a brow and with an eye,â One like a cloud in the moonlight robed, and one like a star on high!â One who was loved by the villagers all, and whose smile was a gift to them, Was found one morn in that pool as cold as the water-lily's stem! Ay, cold as the rank and wasting weeds, which lie in the pool's dark bed, The villagers found that beautiful one, in the slumber of the dead. She had strangely whisper'd her dark design in a young companion's ear, But so wild and vague that the listener smiled, and knew not what to fear. And she went to die in that loathsome pool when the summer day was done, With her dark hair curl'd on her pure white brow, and her fairest garments on; With the ring on her taper finger still, and her necklace of ocean pearl, Twined as in mockery round the neck of that suicidal girl. And why she perish'd so strangely there no mortal tongue can tellâ She told her story to none, and Death retains her secret well! And the willow, whose mossy and aged boughs o'er the silent water lean, Like a sad and sorrowful mourner of the beautiful dead, is seen! But oft, our village maidens say, when the summer evenings fall, When the frog is calling from his pool to the cricket in the wall; When the night-hawk's wing dips lightly down to that dull and sleeping lake, And slow through its green and stagnant mass the shoreward circles breakâ At a time like this, a misty formâas fog beneath the moonâ Like a meteor glides to the startled view, and vanishes as soon; Yet weareth it ever a human shape, and ever a human cry Comes faintly and low on the still night-air, as when the despairing die! LINES ON A PORTRAIT. How beautiful!âThat brow of snow, That glossy fall of fair brown tresses, The blue eye's tranquil heaven below, The hand whereon the fair cheek presses, Half-shadow'd by a falling curl Which on the temple's light reposesâ Each finger like a line of pearl Contrasted with the cheek's pure roses! There, as she sits beneath the shade By vine and rose-wreath'd arbor made, Tempering the light which, soft and warm, Reveals her full and matchless form, In thoughtful quietude, she seems Like one of Raphael's pictur'd dreams, Where blend in one all radiant face The woman's warmthâthe angel's grace! WellâI can gaze upon it now, As on some cloud of autumn's even, Bathing its pinions in the glow And glory of the sunset heavenâ So holy and so far away That love without desire is cherish'd, Like that which lingers o'er the clay Whose warm and breathing life has perish'd, While yet upon its brow is shed The mournful beauty of the dead! And I can look on her as one Too pure for aught save gazing onâ An Idol in some holy place, Which man may kneel to, not caressâ Or melting tone of music heard From viewless lip, or unseen bird. I know her not. And what is all Her beauty to a heart like mine, While memory yet hath power to call Its worship from a stranger-shrine? Still midst the weary din of life The tones I love my ear has met; Midst lips of scorn and brows of strife The smiles I love are lingering yet! The hearts in sun and shadow knownâ The kind hands lingering in our ownâ The cords of strong affection spun By early deeds of kindness doneâ The blessed sympathies which bind The spirit to its kindred mind,â Oh, who would leave these tokens tried For all the stranger-world beside? TO THE MEMORY OF J. O. ROCKWELL. The turf is smooth above him! and this rain Will moisten the rent roots, and summon back The perishing life of its green-bladed grass, And the crush'd flower will lift its head again Smilingly unto Heaven, as if it kept No vigil with the dead. Wellâit is meet That the green grass should tremble, and the flowers Blow wild about his resting-place. His mind Was in itself a flower, but half disclosedâ A bud of blessed promise, which the storm Visited rudely, and the passer by Smote down in wantonness.âBut we may trust That it hath found a dwelling, where the sun Of a more holy clime will visit it, And the pure dews of mercy will descend, Through Heaven's own atmosphere, upon its head. His form is now before me, with no trace Of death in its fine lineaments, and there Is a faint crimson on his youthful cheek, And his free lip is softening with the smile Which in his eye is kindling. I can feel The parting pressure of his hand, and hear His last âGod bless you!ââStrangeâthat he is there Distinct before me like a breathing thing, Even when I know that he is with the dead, And that the damp earth hides him. I would not Think of him otherwiseâhis image lives Within my memory as he seem'd before The curse of blighted feeling, and the toil And fever of an uncongenial strife, had left Their traces on his aspect. Peace to him! He wrestled nobly with the weariness And trials of our beingâsmiling on, While poison mingled with his springs of life, And wearing a calm brow, while on his heart Anguish was resting like a hand of fireâ Until at last the agony of thought Grew insupportable, and madness came Darkly upon him,âand the sufferer died! Nor died he unlamented! To his grave The beautiful and gifted shall go up, And muse upon the sleeper. And young lips Shall murmur in the broken tones of griefâ His own sweet melodiesâand if the ear Of the freed spirit heedeth aught beneath The brightness of its new inheritance, It may be joyful to the parted one To feel that Earth remembers him in love! THE UNQUIET SLEEPER. The Hunter went forth with his dog and gun, In the earliest glow of the golden sun;â The trees of the forest bent over his way, In the changeful colors of Autumn gay; For a frost had fallen the night before On the quiet greenness which Nature wore. A bitter frost!âfor the night was chill, And starry and dark, and the wind was still, And so when the sun looked out on the hills, On the stricken woods and the frosted rills, The unvaried green of the landscape fled, And a wild, rich robe was given instead. We know not whither the Hunter went, Or how the last of his days was spent; For the moon drew nighâbut he came not back, Weary and faint from his forest track; And his wife sat down to her frugal board, Beside the empty seat of her lord. And the day passed on, and the sun came down To the hills of the west, like an angel's crown, The shadows lengthened from wood and hill, The mist crept up from the meadow-rill, Till the broad sun sank, and the red light rolled All over the west, like a wave of gold! Yet he came not backâthough the stars gave forth Their wizard light to the silent Earth; And his wife looked out from the lattice dim In the earnest manner of fear for him; And his fair-haired child on the door-stone stood To welcome his father back from the wood! He came not back!âyet they found him soon, In the burning light of the morrow's noon, In the fixed and visionless sleep of death, Where the red leaves fell at the soft wind's breath; And the dog, whose step in the chase was fleet, Crouched silent and sad at the Hunter's feet. He slept in death;âbut his sleep was one Which his neighbors shuddered to look upon; For his brow was black, and his open eye Was red with the sign of agony: And they thought, as they gazed on his features grim, That an evil deed had been done on him. They buried him where his fathers laid, By the mossy mounds in the grave-yard shade, Yet whispers of doubt passed over the dead, And beldames muttered while prayers were said; And the hand of the sexton shook as he pressed The damp earth down on the Hunter's breast. The seasons passedâand the Autumn rain And the colored forests returned again; 'T was the very eve that the Hunter died, The winds wail'd over the bare hill-side, And the wreathing limbs of the forest shook Their red leaves over the swollen brook. There came a sound on the night-air then, Like a spirit-shriek, to the homes of men, And louder and shriller it rose again, Like the fearful cry of the mad with pain; And trembled alike the timid and brave, For they knew that it came from the Hunter's grave! And every year when Autumn flings Its beautiful robe on created things, When Piscataqua's tide is turbid with rain And Cocheco's woods are yellow again, That cry is heard from the grave-yard earth, Like the howl of a demon struggling forth! THE MURDERED LADY. A dark-hulled brig at anchor rides Within the still and moonlit bay, And round its black, portentous sides The waves like living creatures play! And close at hand a tall ship lies, A voyager from the Spanish Main, Laden with gold and merchandiseâ She'll ne'er return again! The fisher in his seaward skiff Creeps stealthily along the shore Within the shadow of the cliff, Where keel had never ploughed before; He turns him from that stranger bark And hurries down the silvery bay, Where like a demon still and dark, She watches o'er her prey. The midnight came.âA dash of oars Broke on the ocean-stillness then, And swept toward the rocky shores The fierce wild forms of outlawed men;â The tenants of this fearful ship, Grouped strangely in the pale moonlightâ Dark, iron brow and bearded lip, Ghastly with storm and fight. They reach the shore,âbut who is she, The white-robed one they bear along? She shrieksâshe struggles to be freeâ God shield that gentle one from wrong; It may not be,âthose pirate men Along the hushed, deserted street Have borne her to a narrow glen Scarce trod by human feet. And there the ruffians murdered her, When not an eye, save Heaven's, beheld,â Ask of the shuddering villager What sounds upon the night air swelled: Woman's long shriek of mortal fearâ Her wild appeal to hearts of stone, The oathâthe tauntâthe brutal jeerâ The pistol-shotâthe groan! With shout and jest and losel song, From savage tongues which knew no rein, The stained with murder passed along And sought their ocean-home again; And all the night their revel came In hoarse and sullen murmurs on,â A yell rang upâa burst of flameâ The Spanish ship was gone! The morning light came red and fast Along the still and blushing sea; The phantoms of the night had passedâ That ocean-robberâwhere was she? Her sails were reaching from the wind, Her crimson banner-folds were stirred; And ever and anon behind Her shouting crew were heard. Then came the village-dwellers forth And sought with fear the fatal glen; The stain of bloodâthe trampled earthâ Told where the deed of death had been. They found a graveâa new-made oneâ With bloody sabres hollowed out, And shadowed from the searching sun By tall trees round about. They left the hapless stranger there; They knew her sleep would be as well As if the priest had poured his prayer Above her, with the funeral-bell. The few poor rites which man can pay Are felt not by the lonely sleeper; The deaf, unconscious ear of clay Heeds not the living weeper. They tell a taleâthose sea-worn men Who dwell along that rocky coastâ Of sights and sounds within the glen, Of midnight shriek and gliding ghost. And oh! if ever from their chill And dreamless sleep the dead arise, That victim of unhallowed ill Might wake to human eyes! They say that often when the morn Is struggling with the gloomy even, And over moon and stars is drawn The curtain of a clouded heaven, Strange sounds swell up the narrow glen, As if that robber-crew were thereâ The hellish laughâthe shouts of menâ And woman's dying prayer! THE WEIRD GATHERING. A trumpet in the darkness blownâ A peal upon the airâ The church-yard answers to its tone With boding shriek and wail and groanâ The dead are gliding there! It rose upon the still midnight, A summons long and clearâ The wakeful shuddered with affrightâ The dreaming sleeper sprang upright And pressed his stunning ear. The Indian, where his serpent eye Beneath the green-wood shone, Started, and tossed his arms on high, And answered, with his own wild cry, The sky's unearthly tone. The wild birds rose in startled flocks As the long trumpet swelled; And loudly from their old, gray rocks The gaunt, fierce wolf and caverned fox In mutual terror yelled. There is a wild and haunted glen 'Twixt Saugus and Naumkeagâ 'T is said of old that wizard-men And demons to that spot have been To consecrate their league. A fitting place for such as theseâ That small and sterile plain, So girt about with tall old trees Which rock and groan in every breeze, Like spirits cursed with pain. It was the witch's trysting-place, The wizard's chosen ground, Where the accursed of human race With demons gathered, face to face, By the midnight trumpet's sound. And there that night the trumpet rang And rock and hill replied, And down the glen strange shadows sprang, Mortal and fiendâa wizard gangâ Seen dimly side by side. They gathered there from every land That sleepeth in the sun,â They came with spell and charm in hand, Waiting their Master's high commandâ Slaves to the Evil One! From islands of the far-off seasâ From Hecla's ice and flameâ From where the loud and savage breeze Growls through the tall Norwegian trees, Seer, witch, and wizard came! And from the sunny land of palms The negro hag was thereâ The Gree-gree, with his Obi charmsâ The Indian, with his tattooed arms And wild and streaming hair. The Gypsy, with her fierce, dark eyes, The worshipper of flameâ The searcher out of mysteries Above a human sacrificeâ Allâallâtogether came! Nay, look not down that lighted dell, Thou startled traveller!â Thy christian eye should never dwell On gaunt, gray witch and fiend of hell And evil Trumpeter! But the traveller turned him from his way, For he heard the revelling, And saw the red light's wizard ray Among the dark-leafed branches play, Like an unholy thing. He knelt him on the rocks and cast A fearful glance beneath; Wizard and hag before him passed, Each wilder, fiercer than the last,â His heart grew cold as death! He saw the dark-browed Trumpeter, In human shape was he; And witch and fiend and sorcerer, With shriek and laugh and curses, were Assembled at his knee. And lo! beneath his straining glance A light form stole alongâ Free, as if moving to the dance, He saw her fairy steps advance Toward the evil throng. The light along her forehead playedâ A wan, unearthly glare; Her cheek was pale beneath the shade The wildness of her tresses made, Yet nought of fear was there! Now God have mercy on thy brain, Thou stricken traveller! Look on thy victim once again, Bethink thee of her wrongs and painâ Dost thou remember her? The traveller smote his burning brow, For he saw the wronged one thereâ He knew her by her forehead's snow, And by her large blue eye below, And by her wild, dark hair. Slowly, yet firm she held her way,â The wizard's song grew stillâ The sorcerer left his elfish play, And hideous imp and beldame gray Waited the stranger's will. A voice came up that place of fearâ The Trumpeter's hoarse tone: âSpeakâwho art thou that comest here With brow baptized and christian ear, Unsummoned and alone?â One moment, and a tremor shook Her light and graceful frame,â It passed, and then her features took A fiercer and a haughtier look As thus her answer came:â âSpirits of evilâ Workers of doom!â Lo! to your revel For vengeance I comeâ Vengeance on him Who hath blighted my fame! Fill his cup to the brim With a curse without name! Let his false heart inherit The madness of mine, And I yield ye my spirit And bow at your shrine!â A soundâa mingled laugh and yell, Went howling fierce and far; A redder light shone through the dell, As if the very gates of hell Swung suddenly ajar. âBreathe then thy curse, thou daring one,â A low, deep voice replied: âWhate'er thou askest shall be done, The burthen of thy doom upon The false one shall abide.â The maiden stood erectâher brow Grew dark as those around her, As burned upon her lip that vow Which christian ear may never know,â And the dark fetter bound her! Ay, there she stoodâthe holy Heaven Was looking down on herâ An Angel from her bright home drivenâ A spirit lost and doomed and given To fiend and sorcerer! And changedâhow changed!âher aspect grew Fearful and elfish there; The warm tinge from her cheek withdrew, And one dark spot of blood-red hue Burned on her forehead fair. Wild from her eye of madness shone The baleful fire within, As with a shrill and lifted tone She made her fearful purpose known Before the powers of sin:â âLet my curse be upon himâ The faithless of heart! Let the smiles that have won him In frowning depart! Let his last, cherished blossom Of sympathy die, And the hopes of his bosom In shadows go by! Ay, curse himâbut keep The poor boon of his breath Till he sigh for the sleep And the quiet of death! Let a viewless one haunt him With whisper and jeer, And an evil one daunt him With phantoms of fear! Be the fiend unforgiving That follows his tread! Let him walk with the living, Yet gaze on the dead!â She ceased. The doomed one felt the spell Already on his brain; He turned him from the wizard-dell; He prayed to Heaven; he cursed at hell;â He weptâand all in vain. The night was one of mortal fear; The morning rose to him Dark as the shroudings of a bier, As if the blessÃ¨d atmosphere, Like his own soul, was dim. He passed among his fellow-men With wild and dreamy air, For, whispering in his ear again The horrors of the midnight glen, The demon found him there. And when he would have knelt and prayed Amidst his household band, An unseen power his spirit stayed, And on his moving lip was laid A hot and burning hand! The lost one in the solitude Of dreams he gazed upon, And when the holy morning glowed Her dark eye shone; her wild hair flowed Between him and the sun! His brain grew wild,âand then he died; Yet, ere his heart grew cold, To the gray priest who at his side The strength of prayer and blessing tried, His fearful tale was told. They 've bound the witch with many a thongâ The holy priest is near her; And ever as she moves along, A murmur rises fierce and strong From those who hate and fear her. She 's standing up for sacrifice Beneath the gallows-tree; The silent town beneath her lies, Above her are the summer skies, Far off the quiet sea. So youngâso frailâso very fairâ Why should the victim die? Look on her brow!âthe red stain there Burns underneath her tangled hairâ And mark her fiery eye! A thousand eyes are looking up In scorn and hate to her; A bony hand hath coiled the rope, And yawns upon the green hill's slope The witch's sepulchre! Ha! she hath spurned both priest and bookâ Her hand is tossed on highâ Her curse is loud, she will not brook The impatient crowd's abiding lookâ Hark! how she shrieks to die! Upâupâone struggleâall is done! One groanâthe deed is wrought! Wo for the wronged and fallen one!â Her corse is blackened in the sun, Her spiritâtrace it not! THE BLACK FOX. It was a cold and cruel night, Some fourscore years ago, The clouds across the winter sky Were scudding to and fro; The air above was cold and keen, The earth was white below. Around an ancient fireplace A happy household drew; The husband and his own goodwife, And children not a few; And bent above the spinning-wheel The aged grandame too. The fire-light reddened all the room, It rose so high and strong, And mirth was in each pleasant eye Within that household throng; And while the grandame turned her wheel The good man hummed a song. At length spoke up a fair-haired girl, Some seven summers old, âNow grandame, tell the tale again Which yesterday you told; About the Black Fox and the men Who followed him so bold.â âYes, tell it,â said a dark-eyed boy, And âTell it,â said his brother; âJust tell the story of the Fox, We will not ask another.â And all the children gathered close Around their old grandmother. Then lightly in her withered hands The grandame turned her reel, And when the thread was wound away She set aside her wheel, And smiled with that peculiar joy The old and happy feel. â'T is more than sixty years ago Since first the Fox was seenâ 'Twas in the winter of the year, When not a leaf was green, Save where the dark old hemlock stood The naked oaks between. âMy father saw the creature first, One bitter winter's dayâ It passed so near that he could see Its fiery eyeballs play, And well he knew an evil thing, And foul, had crossed his way. âA hunter like my father then We never more shall seeâ The mountain-cat was not more swift Of eye and foot than he: His aim was fatal in the air And on the tallest tree. âYet close beneath his ready aim The Black Fox hurried on, And when the forest echoes mocked The sharp voice of his gun, The creature gave a frightful yell, Long, loud, but only one. âAnd there was something horrible And fiendish in that yell; Our good old parson heard it once, And I have heard him tell That it might well be likened to A fearful cry from hell. âDay after day that Fox was seen, He prowled our forests through, Still gliding wild and spectre-like Before the hunter's view; And howling louder than the storm When savagely it blew. âThe Indians, when upon the wind That howl rose long and clear, Shook their wild heads mysteriously And muttered, as in fear; Or veiled their eyes, as if they knew An evil thing was near. âThey said it was a Fox accurst By Hobomocko's will, That it was once a mighty chief Whom battle might not kill, But who, for some unspoken crime, Was doomed to wander still. âThat every year, when all the hills Were white with winter snow, And the tide of Salmon River ran The gathering ice below, His howl was heard and his form was seen Still hurrying to and fro. âAt length two gallant hunter youths, The boast and pride of allâ The gayest in the hour of mirth The first at danger's call, Our playmates at the village school, Our partners at the ballâ âWent forth to hunt the Sable Fox Beside that haunted stream, Where it so long had glided like The creature of a dream, Or like unearthly forms that dance Under the cold moonbeam! âThey went away one winter day, When all the air was white, And thick and hazed with falling snow, And blinding to the sight; They bade us never fear for them, They would return by night. âThe night fell thick and darkly down, And still the storm blew on; And yet the hunters came not back, Their task was yet undone; Nor came they with their words of cheer, Even with the morrow's sun. âAnd then our old men shook their heads, And the red Indians told Their tales of evil sorcery Until our blood ran cold,â The stories of their Powwow seers, And withered hags of old. âThey told us that our hunters Would never more returnâ That they would hunt for evermore Through tangled swamp and fern, And that their last and dismal fate No mortal e'er might learn. âAnd days and weeks passed slowly on, And yet they came not back, Nor evermore by stream or hill Was seen that form of blackâ Alas! for those who hunted still Within its fearful track! âBut when the winter passed away, And early flowers began To bloom along the sunned hill-side, And where the waters ran, There came unto my father's door A melancholy man. âHis form had not the sign of years, And yet his locks were white, And in his deep and restless eye There was a fearful light; And from its glance we turned away As from an adder's sight. âWe placed our food before that man, So haggard and so wild,â He thrust it from his lips as he Had been a fretful child; And when we spoke with words of cheer, Most bitterly he smiled. âHe smiled, and then a gush of tears, And then a fierce, wild look, And then he murmured of the Fox Which haunted Salmon Brook, Until his hearers every one With nameless terror shook. âHe turned away with a frightful cry, And hurried madly on, As if the dark and spectral thing Before his path had gone: We called him back, but he heeded not The kind and warning tone. âHe came not back to us again, But the Indian hunters said That far, where the howling wilderness Its leafy tribute shed, They found our missing huntersâ Naked and cold and dead. âTheir grave they made beneath the shade Of the old and solemn wood, Where oaks by Time alone hewn down For centuries had stood, And left them without shroud or prayer In the dark solitude. âThe Indians always shun that graveâ The wild deer treads not thereâ The green grass is not trampled down By catamount or bearâ The soaring wild-bird turns away, Even in the upper air. âFor people said that every year, When winter snows are spread All over the face of the frozen earth, And the forest leaves are shed, The Spectre Fox comes forth and howls Above the hunters' bed.â THE INDIAN'S TALE. The War-God did not wake to strife The strong men of our forest land, No red hand grasped the battle-knife At Areouski's high command:â We held no war-dance by the dim And red light of the creeping flame; Nor warrior yell, nor battle hymn Upon the midnight breezes came. There was no portent in the sky, No shadow on the round, bright sun, With light and mirth and melody The long, fair summer days came on. We were a happy people then, Rejoicing in our hunter mood; No foot-prints of the pale-faced men Had marred our forest solitude. The land was oursâthis glorious landâ With all its wealth of wood and streams; Our warriors strong of heart and hand, Our daughters beautiful as dreams. When wearied at the thirsty noon, We knelt us where the spring gushed up, To taste our Father's blessed boonâ Unlike the white man's poison cup. There came unto my father's hut A wan, weak creature of distress; The red man's door is never shut Against the lone and shelterless. And when he knelt before his feet, My father led the stranger in; He gave him of his hunter meatâ Alas! it was a deadly sin! The stranger's voice was not like oursâ His face at first was sadly pale, Anon 'twas like the yellow flowers Which tremble in the meadow gale: And when he laid him down to die, And murmured of his fatherland, My mother wiped his tearful eye, My father held his burning hand! He died at lastâthe funeral yell Rang upward from his burial sod, And the old Powwah knelt to tell The tidings to the white man's God! The next day cameâmy father's brow Grew heavy with a fearful pain, He did not take his hunting-bowâ He never sought the woods again! He died even as the white man died; My mother, she was smitten too; My sisters vanished from my side, Like diamonds from the sunlit dew. And then we heard the Powwahs say That God had sent his angel forth To sweep our ancient tribes away, And poison and unpeople Earth. And it was so: from day to day The Spirit of the Plague went onâ And those at morning blithe and gay Were dying at the set of sun. They diedâour free, bold hunters diedâ The living might not give them graves, Save when along the water-side They cast them to the hurrying waves. The carrion crow, the ravenous beast, Turned loathing from the ghastly dead; Well might they shun the funeral feast By that destroying angel spread! One after one the red men fell, Our gallant war-tribe passed away, And I alone am left to tell The story of its swift decay. Aloneâaloneâa withered leaf, Yet clinging to its naked bough; The pale race scorn the aged chief, And I will join my fathers now. The spirits of my people bend At midnight from the solemn West, To me their kindly arms extend, To call me to their home of rest! THE SPECTRE SHIP. The morning light is breaking forth All over the dark blue sea, And the waves are changedâthey are rich with gold As the morning waves should be, And the rising winds are wandering out On their seaward pinions free. The bark is ready, the sails are set, And the boat rocks on the shoreâ Say why do the passengers linger yet? Is not the farewell o'er? Do those who enter that gallant ship Go forth to return no more? A wailing rose by the water-side, A young, fair girl was there, With a face as pale as the face of Death When its coffin-lid is bare; And an eye as strangely beautiful As a star in the upper air. She leaned on a youthful stranger's armâ A tall and silent oneâ Who stood in the very midst of the crowd, Yet uttered a word to none; He gazed on the sea and the waiting ship, But he gazed on them alone! The fair girl leaned on the stranger's arm, And she wept as one in fear, But he heeded not the plaintive moan And the dropping of the tear; His eye was fixed on the stirring sea, Cold, darkly and severe! The boat was filledâthe shore was leftâ The farewell word was saidâ But the vast crowd lingered still behind With an overpowering dread; They feared that stranger and his bride, So pale and like the dead. And many said that an evil pair Among their friends had gone,â A demon with his human prey, From the quiet graveyard drawn; And a prayer was heard that the innocent Might escape the Evil One. Awayâthe good ship sped away, Out on the broad high seas, The sun upon her path beforeâ Behind, the steady breezeâ And there was nought in sea or sky Of fearful auguries. The day passed onâthe sunlight fell All slantwise from the west, And then the heavy clouds of storm Sat on the ocean's breast; And every swelling billow mourn'd Like a living thing distressed. The sun went down among the clouds, Tinging with sudden gold, The pall-like shadow of the storm, On every mighty foldâ And then the lightning's eye look'd forth, And the red thunder rolled. The storm came down upon the sea, In its surpassing dread, Rousing the white and broken surge Above its rocky bed, As if the deep was stirred beneath A giant's viewless tread. All night the hurricane went on, And all along the shore The smothered cry of shipwreck'd men Blent with the ocean's roar; The gray-haired man had scarcely known So wild a night before. Morn rose upon a tossing sea, The tempest's work was done, And freely over land and wave Shone out the blessed sun; But where was sheâthat merchant barkâ Where had the good ship gone? Men gathered on the shore to watch The billows' heavy swell, Hoping, yet fearing much, some frail Memorial might tell The fate of that disastrous shipâ Of friends they loved so well. None cameâthe billows smoothed away, And all was strangely calm, As if the very sea had felt A necromancer's charm; And not a trace was left behind Of violence and harm. The twilight came with sky of gold, And curtaining of nightâ And then a sudden cry rang out, âA shipâthe ship in sight!â And lo! tall masts grew visible Within the fading light. Near and more near the ship came on, With all her broad sails spreadâ The night grew thick, but a phantom light Around her path was shed, And the gazers shuddered as on she came, For against the wind she sped. They saw by the dim and baleful glare Around that voyager thrown, The upright forms of the well-known crew, As pale and fixed as stone; And they called to them, but no sound came back Save the echoed cry alone. The fearful stranger youth was there, And clasped in his embrace The pale and passing sorrowful Gazed wildly in his face, Like one who had been wakened from The silent burial-place. A shudder ran along the crowd, And a holy man knelt there, On the wet sea-sand, and offered up A faint and trembling prayer, That God would shield his people from The spirits of the air! And lo! the vision passed awayâ The spectre shipâthe crewâ The stranger and his pallid bride, Departed from their view; And nought was left upon the waves Beneath the arching blue. It passed away, that vision strange, Forever from their sight, Yet long shall Naumkeag's annals tell The story of that nightâ The phantom barkâthe ghostly crewâ The pale, encircling light. THE SPECTRE WARRIORS. âAway to your arms! for the foemen are here, The yell of the red man is loud on the ear! Onâon to the garrisonâsoldiers away, The moccasin's track shall be bloody to-day.â The fortress is reached, they have taken their stand, With war-knife in girdle, and rifle in hand;â Their wives are behind them, the savage beforeâ Will the Puritan fail at his hearth-stone and door? There 's a yell in the forest, unearthly and dread, Like the shriek of a fiend o'er the place of the dead; Againâhow it swells through the forest afarâ Have the tribes of the fallen uprisen to war? Haâlook! they are comingânot cautious and slow, In the serpent-like mood of the blood-seeking foe, Nor stealing in shadow nor hiding in grass, But tall and uprightly and sternly they pass. âBe ready!ââthe watchword has passed on the wallâ The maidens have shrunk to the innermost hallâ The rifles are levelledâeach head is bowed lowâ Each eye fixes steadyâGod pity the foe! They are closely at hand! Ha! the red flash has broke From the garrisoned wall through a curtain of smoke, There 's a yell from the dyingâthat aiming was trueâ The red man no more shall his hunting pursue! Look, look to the earth, as the smoke rolls away, Do the dying and dead on the green herbage lay? What mean those wild glances? no slaughter is thereâ The red man has gone like the mist on the air! Unharmed as the bodiless air he has gone From the war-knife's edge and the ranger's long gun, And the Puritan warrior has turned him away From the weapons of war, and is kneeling to pray! He fears that the Evil and Dark One is near, On an errand of wrath, with his phantoms of fear; And he knows that the aim of his rifle is vainâ That the spectres of evil may never be slain! He knows that the Powwah has cunning and skill To call up the Spirit of Darkness at will; To waken the dead in their wilderness-graves, And summons the demons of forest and waves. And he layeth the weapons of battle aside, And forgetteth the strength of his natural pride, And he kneels with the priest by his garrisoned door, That the spectres of evil may haunt him no more! THE LAST NORRIDGEWOCK. She stood beneath the shadow of an oak, Grim with uncounted winters, and whose boughs Had sheltered in their youth the giant forms Of the great chieftain's warriors. She was fair, Even to a white man's visionâand she wore A blended grace and dignity of mien Which might befit the daughter of a kingâ The queenliness of nature. She had all The magic of proportion which might haunt The dream of some rare painter, or steal in Upon the musings of the sanctuary Like an unreal vision. She was dark,â There was no play of crimson on her cheek, Yet were her features beautiful. Her eye Was clear and wildâand brilliant as a beam Of the live sunshine; and her long, dark hair Sway'd in rich masses to th' unquiet wind. The West was glad with sunset. Over all The green hills and the wilderness there fell A great and sudden glory. Half the sky Was full of glorious tints, as if the home And fountain of the rainbow were revealed; And through its depth of beauty looked the star Of the blest Evening, like an angel's eye. The Indian watched the sunset, and her eye Glistened one moment; then a tear fell down, For she was dreaming of her fallen raceâ The mighty who had perishedâfor her creed Had taught her that the spirits of the brave And beautiful were gathered in the Westâ The red man's Paradise;âand then she sang Faintly her song of sorrow, with a low And half-hushed tone, as if she knew that those Who listened were unearthly auditors, And that the dead had bowed themselves to hear. âThe moons of autumn wax and wane, the sound of swelling floods Is borne upon the mournful wind, and broadly on the woods The colors of the changing leavesâthe fair, frail flowers of frost, Before the round and yellow sun most beautiful are tossed. The morning breaketh with a clear, bright pencilling of sky, And blushes through its golden clouds as the great sun goes by; And evening lingers in the Westâmore beautiful than dreams Which whisper of the Spirit-land, its wilderness and streams! âA little timeâanother moonâthe forest will be sadâ The streams will mourn the pleasant light which made their journey glad; The morn will faintly lighten up, the sunlight glisten cold, And wane into the western sky without its autumn gold. âAnd yet I weep not for the sign of desolation nearâ The ruin of my hunter race may only ask a tear,â The wailing streams will laugh again, the naked trees put on The beauty of their summer green beneath the summer sun; The autumn cloud will yet again its crimson draperies fold, The star of sunset smile againâa diamond set in gold! But never for their forest lake, or for their mountain path, The mighty of our race shall leave the hunting-ground of Death. âI know the tale my fathers toldâthe legend of their fameâ The glory of our spotless race before the pale ones cameâ When asking fellowship of none, by turns the foe of all, The death-bolts of our vengeance fell, as Heaven's own lightnings fall; When at the call of Tacomet, my warrior-sire of old, The war-shout of a thousand men upon the midnight rolled; And fearless and companionless our warriors strode alone, And from the big lake to the sea the green earth was their own. âWhere are they now? Around their changed and stranger-peopled home, Full sadly o'er their thousand graves the flowers of autumn bloomâ The bow of strength is buried with the calumet and spear, And the spent arrow slumbereth, forgetful of the deer! The last canoe is rotting by the lake it glided o'er, When dark-eyed maidens sweetly sang its welcome from the shore. The foot-prints of the hunter race from all the hills have goneâ Their offerings to the Spirit-land have left the altar-stoneâ The ashes of the council-fire have no abiding tokenâ The song of war has died awayâthe Powwah's charm is brokenâ The startling war-whoop cometh not upon the loud, clear airâ The ancient woods are vanishingâthe pale men gather there. âAnd who is left to mourn for this?âa solitary one, Whose life is waning into death like yonder setting sun! A broken reed, a faded flower, that lingereth behind, To mourn above its fallen race, and wrestle with the wind! Lo! from the Spirit-land I hear the voices of blest; The holy faces of the loved are leaning from the West. The mighty and the beautifulâthe peerless ones of oldâ They call me to their pleasant sky and to their thrones of gold; Ere the spoilers' eye hath found me, when there are none to saveâ Or the evil-hearted pale-face made the free of soul a slave; Ere the step of air grow weary, or the sunny eye be dim, The father of my people is calling me to him.â THE AÃRIAL OMENS. A light is troubling Heaven!âA strange, dull glow Is trembling like a fiery veil between The blue sky and the earth; and the far stars Glimmer but faintly through it. Day hath left No traces of its presence, and the blush With which it welcomed the embrace of Night Has faded from the sky's blue cheek, as fades The blush of human beauty when the tone Or look which woke its evidence of love Hath passed away forever. Wherefore then Burns the strange fire in Heaven?âIt is as if Nature's last curseâthe terrible plague of fire, Were working in her elements, and the sky Consuming like a vapor. Loâa change! The fiery flashes sink, and all along The dim horizon of the fearful North Rests a broad crimson, like a sea of blood, Untroubled by a wave. And loâabove, Bendeth a luminous arch of pale, pure white, Clearly contrasted with the blue above And the lark red beneath it. Glorious! How like a pathway for the sainted onesâ The pure and beautiful intelligences Who minister in Heaven, and offer up Their praise as incense; or, like that which rose Before the pilgrim-prophet, when the tread Of the most holy angels brightened it, And in his dream the haunted sleeper saw The ascending and descending of the blest! Another change. Strange, fiery forms uprise On the wide arch, and take the throngful shape Of warriors gathering to the strife on high,â A dreadful marching of infernal shapes, Beings of fire with plumes of bloody red, With banners flapping o'er their crowded ranks, And long swords quivering up against the sky! And now they meet and mingle; and the ear Listens with painful earnestness to catch The ring of cloven helmets and the groan Of the down-trodden. But there comes no sound, Save a low, sullen rush upon the air, Such as the unseen wings of spirits make, Sweeping the void above us. All is still. Yet falls each red sword fiercely, and the hoof Of the wild steed is crushing on the breast Of the o'erthrown and vanquished. 'Tis a strange And awful conflictâan unearthly war! It is as if the dead had risen up To battle with each otherâthe stern strife Of spirits visible to mortal eyes. Steed, plume, and warrior vanish one by one, Wavering and changing to unshapely flame; And now across the red and fearful sky A long bright flame is trembling, like the sword Of the great Angel at the guarded gate Of Paradise, when all the sacred groves And beautiful flowers of Eden-land blushed red Beneath its awful shadow; and the eye Of the lone outcast quailed before its glare, As from the immediate questioning of God. And men are gazing on that troubled sky With most unwonted earnestness, and fair And beautiful brows are reddening in the light Of that strange vision of the upper air; Even as the dwellers of Jerusalem, The leaguered of the Roman, when the sky Of Palestine was thronged with fiery shapes, And from Antonio's tower the mailed Jew Saw his own image pictured in the air, Contending with the heathen; and the priest Beside the Temple's altar veiled his face From that most horrid phantasy, and held The censer of his worship with a hand Shaken by terror's palsy. It has passedâ And Heaven again is quiet; and its stars Smile down serenely. There is not a stain Upon its dream-like loveliness of blueâ No token of the fiery mystery Which made the evening fearful. But the hearts Of those who gazed upon it, yet retained The shadow of its aweâthe chilling fear Of its ill-boding aspect. It is deemed A revelation of the things to comeâ Of war and its calamitiesâthe storm Of the pitched battle, and the midnight strife Of heathen inroadâthe devouring flame, The dripping tomahawk, the naked knife, The swart hand twining with the silken locks Of the fair girlâthe torture, and the bonds Of perilous captivity with those Who know not mercy, and with whom revenge Is sweeter than the cherished gift of life.</field>
