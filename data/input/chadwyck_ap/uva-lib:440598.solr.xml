      <field name="fulltext">THE AGE OF BENEVOLENCE. BOOK I. Benevolence the glory of Heaven. THE ARGUMENT. General subject proposed. Invocation. Subject of the first book. The Benevolence of God in the works of nature. Illustration from an example of vernal scenery. God's Benevolence, the theme of revelation. Its immediate exercise in his providence. Its higher glory in his moral government. Its highest in the work of redemption, and in the renovating effects of the preaching of the cross. Objection to the Divine Benevolence from the existence of sin. Another from future punishments. A third from the afflictions of the pious in this life. The happy tendency of these afflictions illustrated by the history of Orville and Charlotte. Importance of the doctrine of God's Benevolence. A hymn of praise. The Benevolence of angels. That of saints in glory. BOOK II. Benevolence on earth the resemblance of Heaven. THE ARGUMENT. Contrast between this world and heaven. Nature of Benevolence: distinct from constitutional kindness. Not kindled by natural religion. Implanted by divine grace in the place of native selfishness. Its excellence. Its power illustrated by an example. A safe-guard from tempting passions. Its activity a cure for religious melancholy. BOOK III. The need of Benevolence. THE ARGUMENT. Profaneness. Sabbath-breaking. Intemperance. Slavery. War. The Heathen. BOOK IV. The Rewards of Benevolence. THE ARGUMENT. The happiness, flowing naturally from the exercise of Benevolence, already sung, really a great reward. So is the success of benevolence, its happy effects on the world. But the design of this book is to treat more at large, of the absolute blessings promised by God, as the reward of well-doing. The body to share in the glory of heavenâits resurrection certainâ a Spiritual body, incorruptible, glorious. Moral likeness. Freedom from sorrow. Happiness from various sourcesâsociety of angels, of each otherâ God and the Lamb the chief sources. All these enjoyments increasing, eternal. Resurrection, the time when they that have done good will be introduced to the consummation of all their gloryâbut the soul of each happy at death. Death of Horatio. Christian's great and sudden change, a motive to activity in preparation. Negligence caused by unbelief. Faith in an invisible heaven reasonable. The effects of this faith, &amp;c. BOOK I. Of true benevolence, its charms divine, With other motives to call forth its power, And its grand triumphs, multiplied beyond All former bounds, in this its golden age, Humbly I sing, awed by the holy theme; A theme exalted, though as yet unsung, In beauty rich, of inspiration full, And worthy of a nobler harp than that From which heroic strains sublimely sound. Thou who art only and supremely good, Thee, thee alone, with trembling I invoke, From no pretended consciousness of need, And for no vain imaginary aid. Deign thou to smile upon my poor attempt To sing the glories of thy truth and love, Thyself and kingdom. With extended hand Bear me along; surround me with thy light; My heart enlarge and soften; every power Make sacred for thyself; and let thy love Constrain me. Give me purity of aim, By selfishness untainted, lest my lips Thy truth profane. O make my whole intent, Thy glory to promote by doing good; And, if successful, thine shall be the praise. If in the universe there be a world Uncursed by sin, beyond conception fair, Inhabited with intelligences pure, Of more exalted nature than our own, And perfect in enjoyment, what it is That forms their excellence and chief delight, Not one of human kind, without a soul Of its sublime capacity to rise Unmindful, and a heart to virtue dead, Can think it vain to know, or, knowing, fail To imitate. Of such a world so fair, Filled with inhabitants so pure and blest, And with the visible presence of the Source Of all existence, long have mortals heard; And of each being in that happy world, From Him who sits on its eternal throne To him that holds the humblest station there, Love is the bliss, the glory doing good. Of God's benevolence, proof in his works From their beginning, and in all his ways, Illustrious shines. What motive, but desire To give felicity, called forth his might To build this fair creation; to surround His dwelling in the immensity of space With orb encircling orb, to give to dust The happiness of life in countless forms Delightful, and to creatures rational His pure immortal nature to impart? Was it his glory? 'Twas his goodness still; For both are one, inseparably one. God seeks not his, as men their glory seek; From vain ambition. Earth and heaven sublime Were not created for the mere display Of power and skill immeasurably great; Nor men and angels merely to admire The wondrous fabric, and its Author praise With lofty songs. The whole grand universe Is not an empty monument of fame; Nor yet a monument, on a wide waste Erected, for no purpose known to man. 'Tis not a pageant bright, o'er an expanse Illimitable, moving with vain pomp, In revolutions vain. The glory sought In its creation, is but that which flows From giving happiness with bounteous hand. Its Maker, full of goodness infinite, Self-moved, in acts beneficent poured forth Of his abundance, as the sun, all light And heat itself, cannot but shine and warm. On each created thing within his view, From the most humble to the most sublime, Man while yet sinless, in a world prepared For happy innocence a fit abode, Beheld, in characters entire and bright, The impress of benevolence divine. And e'en apostate man, by reason led, Unaided reason, in a world defaced For his revolt, beholds remaining marks Of like benevolence, in mercy spared, When just had been a universal curse. Marks of its primitive glory he beholds Amid its desolations, as he views Among the ruins of a city, famed For ancient splendour, many a precious stone, And marble fragment beautifully wrought. He sees them in the grateful interchange Of day and night, and the propitious round Of seasons;âin the growth of forests vast Where winter's cold requires the cheering flame, And, when these fail, in mines of fuel found Beneath earth's surface;âin the countless streams That streak its map immense, so duly ranged, Like the thick branching fibres of a leaf, The less along the greater on each side, Watering the whole;âin genial suns and rains, Combining their sweet influences, to crown The year with plenty;âin the thousand plants Of healing virtue, of all various kinds, Growing at hand where human pain is felt;â And in the powers by which each living thing, Down to the meanest and the most minute, Finds out its food, where'er its lot is cast, Provided there. From what but kindness flow These and like blessings? Or if such be deemed Means requisite existence to prolong, E'en though unhappy, other proofs remain Of kindness, clear to reason's naked eye. Why this profusion in the fruits of earth, And sweet variety, so far beyond The mere supply of nature's simple wants? Why not the fruit without the fragrant flower? Or if the fragrance to its proper food Attract the wandering insect, why the hues, Their endless beautiful diversities, Enamelling the fields and verdant groves? Why is man fitted to receive delight From aught that he beholds? Why, in its use, Is not each sense an instrument of pain, Instead of pleasure? Why with objects fair Is the eye charmed, and with melodious sounds The listening ear? Why at the frugal board, As at a banquet, is the taste regaled, When food as well might nourish, though devoid Of flavour, or unpleasant, and the love Of life instinctively constrain to eat? 'Twas pure good-will, that for ungrateful man Enjoyment thus for its own sake prepared Nor less apparent is the will to bless, In that delight inferior creatures feel; The sporting insects, and the warbling birds, The bounding and the ruminating flocks, Yea, all the tribes, that walk, or swim, or fly. His providence the Lord of all extends O'er all his works, not merely to uphold, But to impart enjoyment to all ranks Of conscious being. This his kind extent, To unassisted reason, if not blind From deep and wilful turpitude of heart, How brightly clear, when in some rural scene Blooming and sunny, fertile fields, green woods, Pure air and water, with fair creatures swarm, Seeming, in their exuberance of good, Too full of pleasure for a moment's rest; And when this rural beauty and delight, Are heightened by some renovating change, From drought to showers, or from foul skies to fair! The spring, made dreary by incessant rain, Was well nigh gone, and not a glimpse appeared Of vernal loveliness, but light-green turf Round the deep bubbling fountain in the vale, Or by the rivulet on the hill-side, near Its cultivated base, fronting the south, Where in the first warm rays of March it sprung Amid dissolving snow:âsave these mere specks Of earliest verdure, with a few pale flowers, In other years bright blowing soon as earth Unveils her face, and a faint vermil tinge On clumps of maple of the softer kind, Was nothing visible to give to May, Though far advanced, an aspect more like her's Than like November's universal gloom. All day beneath the sheltering hovel stood The drooping herd, or lingered near to ask The food of winter. A few lonely birds, Of those that in this northern clime remain Throughout the year, and in the dawn of spring, At pleasant noon, from their unknown retreat Come suddenly to view with lively notes, Or those that soonest to this clime return From warmer regions, in thick groves were seen, But with their feathers ruffled, and despoiled Of all their glossy lustre, sitting mute, Or only skipping, with a single chirp, In quest of food. Whene'er the heavy clouds, That half way down the mountain side oft hung, As if o'erloaded with their watery store, Were parted, though with motion unobserved, Through their dark opening, white with snow appeared Its lowest, e'en its cultivated, peaks. With sinking heart the husbandman surveyed The melancholy scene, and much his fears On famine dwelt; when, suddenly awaked At the first glimpse of daylight, by the sound, Long time unheard, of cheerful martins, near His window, round their dwelling chirping quick, With spirits by hope enlivened up he sprung To look abroad, and to his joy beheld A sky without the remnant of a cloud. From gloom to gayety and beauty bright So rapid now the universal change, The rude survey it with delight refined, And e'en the thoughtless talk of thanks devout. Long swoln in drenching rain, seeds, germs, and buds, Start at the touch of vivifying beams. Moved by their secret force, the vital lymph Diffusive runs, and spreads o'er wood and field A flood of verdure. Clothed, in one short week, Is naked nature in her full attire. On the first morn, light as an open plain Is all the woodland, filled with sunbeams, poured Through the bare tops, on yellow leaves below, With strong reflection: on the last, 'tis dark With full-grown foliage, shading all within. In one short week the orchard buds and blooms; And now, when steeped in dew or gentle showers, It yields the purest sweetness to the breeze, Or all the tranquil atmosphere perfumes. E'en from the juicy leaves, of sudden growth, And the rank grass of steaming ground, the air, Filled with a watery glimmering receives A grateful smell, exhaled by warming rays. Each day are heard, and almost every hour, New notes to swell the music of the groves. And soon the latest of the feathered train At evening twilight come;âthe lonely snipe, O'er marshy fields, high in the dusky air, Invisible, but, with faint tremulous tones, Hovering or playing o'er the listener's head;â And, in mid-air, the sportive night-hawk, seen Flying awhile at random, uttering oft; A cheerful cry, attended with a shake Of level pinions, dark, but when upturned Against the brightness of the western sky, One white plume showing in the midst of each, Then far down diving with loud hollow sound;â And, deep at first within the distant wood, The whip-poor-will, her name her only song. She, soon as children from the noisy sport Of hooping, laughing, talking with all tones, To hear the echoes of the empty barn, Are by her voice diverted, and held mute, Comes to the margin of the nearest grove; And when the twilight deepened into night, Calls them within, close to the house she comes, And on its dark side, haply on the step Of unfrequented door, lighting unseen, Breaks into strains articulate and clear, The closing sometimes quickened as in sport. Now, animate throughout, from morn to eve All harmony, activity, and joy, Is lovely nature, as in her blest prime. The robin to the garden, or green yard, Close to the door repairs to build again Within her wonted tree; and at her work Seems doubly busy, for her past delay. Along the surface of the winding stream, Pursuing every turn, gay swallows skim; Or round the borders of the spacious lawn Fly in repeated circles, rising o'er Hillock and fence, with motion serpentine, Easy and light. One snatches from the ground A downy feather, and then upward springs, Followed by others, but oft drops it soon, In playful mood, or from too slight a hold, When all at once dart at the falling prize. The flippant blackbird with light yellow crown, Hangs fluttering in the air, and chatters thick Till her breath fail, when, breaking off, she drops On the next tree, and on its highest limb, Or some tall flag, and gently rocking, sits, Her strain repeating. With sonorous notes Of every tone, mixed in confusion sweet, All chanted in the fulness of delight, The forest rings:âwhere, far around enclosed With bushy sides, and covered high above With foliage thick, supported by bare trunks, Like pillars rising to support a roof, It seems a temple vast, the space within Rings loud and clear with thrilling melody. Apart, but near the choir, with voice distinct, The merry mocking-bird together links In one continued song their different notes, Adding new life and sweetness to them all. Hid under shrubs, the squirrel that in fields Frequents the stony wall and briery fence, Here chirps so shrill that human feet approach Unheard till just upon him, when with cries Sudden and sharp he darts to his retreat, Beneath the mossy hillock or aged tree; But oft a moment after re-appears, First peeping out, then starting forth at once With a courageous air, yet in his pranks Keeping a watchful eye, nor venturing far Till left unheeded. In rank pastures graze, Singly and mutely, the contented herd; And on the upland rough the peaceful sheep; Regardless of the frolic lambs, that, close Beside them, and before their faces prone, With many an antic leap, and butting feint, Try to provoke them to unite in sport, Or grant a look, till tired of vain attempts; When, gathering in one company apart, All vigour and delight, away they run, Straight to the utmost corner of the field The fence beside; then, wheeling, disappear In some small sandy pit, then rise to view; Or crowd together up the heap of earth Around some upturned root of fallen tree, And on its top a trembling moment stand, Then to the distant flock at once return. Exhilarated by the general joy, And the fair prospect of a fruitful year, The peasant, with light heart, and nimble step, His work pursues, as it were pastime sweet. With many a cheering word, his willing team, For labour fresh, he hastens to the field Ere morning lose its coolness; but at eve When loosened from the plough and homeward turned, He follows slow and silent, stopping oft To mark the daily growth of tender grain And meadows of deep verdure, or to view His scattered flock and herd, of their own will Assembling for the night by various paths, The old now freely sporting with the young, Or labouring with uncouth attempts at sport. When so luxuriant, and so fair, is all Of vegetative growth, and on all sides Creatures so happy, single, and in groups, And countless multitudes, attract the eye, The thoughtfully observant, with no light But that reflected hence, if such there be Without that clearer light from heaven direct, Cannot o'erlook the goodness of the Power Invisible, that thus delights to bless. But why at nature gaze with pagan eyes, And only at her fairest happiest scenes, When revelation shines, and gilds the whole? That God is good, and nothing does but good, Is the one truth of his whole written word. 'Tis the deep root, that to this tree of life All its vitality and beauty gives. Turn we again to nature, with the book Of inspiration open in our hands To be our guide, no longer need we seek For single tokens of Jehovah's love. All things declare it, and with accents loud Call for loud songs of gratitude and praise. The gifts of heaven, innumerable, descend On all the earth, silent, and uniform, Like dew distilling from a smiling sky, Or like the steady falling of a shower When the sun shines, and gilds the drops in air, And on the quivering leaves, and bending grass. Look where it may, the opened eye of faith Beholds the fulness of benevolence, And oft its overflowing, as in showers Falling on seas, on barren rocks and sands;â In wholesome fruit within the wilderness, Growing each year, and perishing uncropt;â In myriads of living atoms, found In every turf, and leaf, and breath of air, Too small indeed for unassisted sight, But not too small to feel the good they have, Nor yet unworthy care that knows no bound. Illumined by the rays of truth divine, The universe a lovely aspect wears, From its Creator's universal smile. About its vast circumference his arms In tender love are stretched, in one embrace The whole encircling, as the milky zone Surrounds the starry firmament immense. His six days' work completed, God ordained A day of rest; but not from further care Of his creation rested he, concealed In a pavilion of impervious clouds, Nor, like a Hindoo deity, entranced Or sleeping on some consecrated height, Nor merely watching with all-seeing eye The movement of his works. His outstretched hand, When he had sent into the boundless void The rolling spheres, dropt not to let them find Their untried way, unguided, unsustained, And by the force of that first impulse run Their ceaseless round. Noâhad he thus withdrawn His active power immediate, from the worlds, Created by his might, and hid himself Above the highest, careless of them all, How in an instant had they burst their bond Of sweet attraction, flying all apart, Systems and constellations mingling wild, And far asunder vanished into nought, Like parted bubbles by the whirlwind driven! Or how had they together rushed, and sunk, A mass of ruins, in a vortex, formed By their own motion, into the abyss! Had he once turned his countenance away From this fair earth, and from these nether skies, And risen to show its light no more below, Darkness and chaos had returned amain, Closed in behind him even to his throne. And should he now depart, no long-fixed laws Could still preserve the spheres in harmony, And in accustomed orbits roll them on Through regions wide of unsubstantial air. As when the massy weights, that move the clock Of some superb cathedral, for its age And sanctity a venerable pile, By small disorder loosened from their hold, Run down at once, with sound of rushing wheels, While hands enormous, flying their wonted round, Seem to the thoughtful, gazing silently, Thus in a moment whirling months away, So this stupendous complicate machine Of suns and systems, wheeling round the skies, Were but the pressure of God's finger gone, Would on a sudden hasten to its end With tumult loud, cut short the reign of time, And spend its force till every motion ceased With deadened stop. Should the Most High let loose From his controlling grasp, the elements Of this calm globe, the sea would burst its bars, And deluge every land; or furious winds, With earthquakes and volcanoes, rage and waste With universal sway. Or should he leave To work alone, what men call principles Of animal and vegetable life, How would the fields and forests, though arrayed In summer's gay profusion, all at once To wintry nakedness and gloom return, And every creature, though with vigour flushed Or pleasure, die as with a single stroke! How desolate were nature, and how void Of every charm, how like a naked waste Of Africa, were not a present God Beheld employing, in its various scenes, His active might to animate and adorn! What life and beauty, when in all that breathes, Or moves, or grows, his hand is viewed at work!â When it is viewed unfolding every bud, Each blossom tinging, shaping every leaf, Wafting each cloud that passes o'er the sky, Rolling each billow, moving every wing That fans the air, and every warbling throat Heard in the tuneful woodlands. In the least, As well as in the greatest of his works, Is ever manifest his presence kind; As well in swarms of glittering insects, seen Quick to and fro within a foot of air Dancing a merry hour, then seen no more, As in the systems of resplendent worlds Through time revolving in unbounded space. His eye, while comprehending in one view The whole creation, fixes full on me; As on me shines the sun with his full blaze, While o'er the hemisphere he spreads the same. His hand, while holding oceans in its palm, And compassing the skies, surrounds my life, Guards the poor rush-light from the blast of death. O'er men and angels, and o'er all beside With understanding formed and moral sense, If other ranks there be, unknown on earth, Dominion absolute the King of heaven, In majesty maintains, but with a care And tenderness parental, claiming nought But filial love, and that obedience, due To excellence and kindness infinite, Their gain to yield, their true felicity Unspeakable and endless. Here shines out Jehovah's glory, in his government Of countless beings to himself allied; Here in his moral kingdom, in its worth All computation of created powers Transcending far, as far as it transcends The universe of life irrational And senseless matter, made but for the use Of this superior universe of minds, And but for this preserved, ennobled thus With grandeur, and with beauty thus adorned. Through his intelligent creation reigns The eternal Sovereign, with supreme control O'er all events, all actions, and all hearts, In pure benevolence directing all, One object to accomplish, good immense, The best and greatest good by boundless power To be attained, or e'en to be conceived By the omniscient mind. For this he doomed Apostate angels to the pit of wo Interminable, and the faithful fixed In everlasting innocence and bliss On heavenly thrones. For this alone he rules Among the nations, here exalting one, And there another humbling to the dust; Here sending peace, and there the scourge of war; Here planting, and there rooting out from earth. O the consoling thought, that, from this world With violence covered, shaken by the tread Of giant conquerors stalking o'er its realms, The shock of armed hosts together dashed, The revolutions and the frequent fall Of mighty empires, whose will, may lift His pained eye to heaven, and find relief In viewing there, high on a spotless throne, A God all goodness overruling all Himself to show, his glory to augment, And swell the tide of happiness and praise, To roll unmingled through eternity, And unrestrained, when earth has passed away! But, far above all others, though sublime, One grand display of goodness infinite Rises to view, astonishes, attracts, Commands the admiration of high heaven, The gratitude of earth. All eyes at once To Calvary look, for this supreme display Of greatness and benevolence combined; To man's redemption from the curse deserved Of death eternal, at the price of blood Poured from the wounds of God's expiring Son, Poured from his heart of overflowing love. Here all the glories of the Godhead meet, And in one splendid constellation shine; Here with consummate harmony they blend Their various beauties, and together form A token of mercy, thrown across that cloud Suspended o'er the world, with vengeance charged, Threatening destruction. Wisdom, justice, power, All measureless, to this stupendous work The grandeur of divinity impart; But love imparts the loveliness divine. Love, love unspeakable, pervades the whole, Throughout diffusing its immortal charms. Love was its source in the eternal mind, And its accomplishment was wrought by love. Love made the covenant ere time began, And love fulfilled it at the destined hour. 'Twas love that wept, and agonized, and died; That rose to intercede, and judge, and reign. 'Tis love unquenchable, its great design Pursuing still intently, that sends down The gracious Spirit, to constrain, and fit, The guilty proffered pardon to receive The lost, salvation; and almighty love Its work to finish, in despite of earth, Sin, death, and hell, combined for its defeat, Safely, triumphantly, to heaven conveys Trophies innumerable, there to shine Forever, to its everlasting praise. The bleeding cross, howe'er by thankless man Scorned as the monument of his deep guilt, His utter helplessness, ruin entire, Entire dependence on another's aid, Is yet the only monument that shows, In all the greatness of his high descent And destiny immortal, his true worth In Heaven's account. The cross, howe'er despised, And to a curse perverted by the blind, Is yet the only ladder to the skies, For men to climb, or angels to descend. Between this world and that of spirits blest, Glad intercourse, without the cross, were none. The earth, united by no golden chain Of mercy, to the realm of innocence, By none united to the throne above, Would run alone its melancholy course, By its Creator's never-changing frown Blasted throughout, presenting to the sight Of heaven's pure beings, keeping all aloof, A spectacle of horror unrelieved. Torn from the anchor of hope, a wreck immense, With what rapidity and terrible force, Straight toward destruction would it drive along, From its whole surface sending to the skies The shrieks and wailings of despairing men! Without the radiance of ethereal day, From the third heaven let down, a cheering stream, Through the one skylight opened by the cross, With what thick darkness were this dungeon filled, That nothing could remove and none endure, And live there those, within this heavenly light, Who, fond of darkness, madly shut their eyes, And grope, at every step, in painful doubt Which way to turn, though on the fatal brink? As if upon a world of one long night A sun should rise, and its inhabitants, In wilful blindness, should still feel their way, Stumbling at noon. Is there, within this light, A single eye, that overlooks the cross, As fabled, or not needed? Can there be An eye, that never watered it with tears Of penitence and love? a stubborn knee, That never bowed before it? or a hand That never clasped it with the energy Of hope, in that glad moment when it springs From deep despair? O, can there be a heart, That never, at its foot, poured out itself In supplications, thanks, and humble vows Of unreserved devotedness till death? Away with every refuge from the woes, Here and hereafter, but the bleeding cross! Who flees to any other, for relief From conscious guilt, and misery, is undone; Who leads to any other, them that wait His guidance, adds their ruin to his own, And on himself redoubled vengeance draws. Wo to the men who tear away the cross! Sole prop and pillar of a sinking world, If its foundation by unhallowed hands Be undermined, what, what can give support? But, hush, my fears! it rests not on the sand; The raging waves, that dash against its base, Sink harmless, after foaming out their shame: Quick, at the voice of the Almighty Word, Away they shrink, their shallowness betray, Stir up, and leave exposed to every eye, The foulness at the bottom ill concealed. From Calvary springs the only fount of life, Knowledge, and truth, celestial. Whoso drinks Feels immortality begun within, And his dim vision cleared from every mist Of doubt and ignorance; its virtues high He that contemns, is wholly dead at heart, And, in a maze of errors without end Bewildered, darkling winds his joyless way. Divine Redeemer, thou art truth itself; In thee are found its sum and living source, Its boundless and inestimable stores. They that forsake thee, that with hands profane From thee thy uncreated glory wrest, Thy independent throne, and in the pride Of false philosophy, refuse to sit Meek learners at thy feet, how fast they pass From one delusion to another worse, Gone, from the earliest hesitating thought Of leaving thee, well nigh beyond the hope Of restoration, as if left in turn! One step from thee, thy Godhead, and thy cross Inseparable, and down a steep descent, Down, down they go, with bold and bolder strides, Till, all restraint thrown off, one desperate plunge Sink them below the light of truth and heaven, In the dread gulf of infidelity, The fatal gulf. Between this rayless depth, And that celestial height, from which they leap Who once from thee depart, exists no ground On which to rest; all is but empty air; In which wide void each pause the falling make, Is but a transient hovering on the wing. Saviour of men, almighty as thou art, And infinite in mercy, to thy throne, Though human argument and friendship fail, Restore the wandering, there to kneel again In adoration, and repeat the praise Of thy divine perfections, once their song. Turn back the tide of error flowing wide, Bearing away the boundaries of truth For ages fixed, the enclosure breaking down Of many a garden planted by thy hand, Laying it open to the world's wide waste. 'Tis when the cross is preached, and only then, That from the pulpit a mysterious power Goes forth to renovate the moral man. The cross imparts vitality divine, And energy omnipotent, to truth; To its whole system, ineffectual else, Inanimate. He that, without it, wields The sacred sword, at best, in mock display, A useless weapon flourishes in its sheath; None feel its edge, none fear it. Men there are, Men of illustrious name, that have employed Years in portraying to admiring crowds, In vivid colours, with the magic hand Of genius guided by refining taste, The loveliness of virtue, and of vice The hideous features, and in urging all, With eloquent tongue, to make the happy choice, And, at the end, with grief and self-reproach, Have looked around in vain for the reformed. On all the moral field within its reach, Their beautiful philosophy has fallen Powerless, as moonlight cold on the cold snow. Convinced at length of this its impotence, And taught divinely to proclaim instead Messiah crucified, on the same field With joy have they beheld an aspect new, From fruits abundant of immortal growth. When amid frozen seas, mountains of ice, And all the horrors of a polar clime, Moravia's humble but heroic sons The bold attempt began, truth to make known To the besotted Greenlander, and lead His feet into the path of virtue and life, They pointed to the heavens thick set with stars, All, to the least, twinkling with vivid beams, Presenting a whole living firmament Through the clear atmosphere, intensely cold, Of his long wintry night; and to the sun, Duly returning to spread o'er his vales A sudden, transitory, summer smileâ To these, and objects visible like these, His eye they long directed, and from them To their Creator laboured long to raise His grovelling thoughts, devotion to inspire, And teach obedience; while with stupid awe He gazed and listened, or with wonder wild, But still to vice remained a willing slave, Till, of success from efforts thus pursued Despairing, they conducted him at once A ruined wretch to Calvary, when with guilt He trembled at the sight, melted in love, Shook off the long-fixed clinging habit of sin, And from his bestial degradation rose, To intellectual and virtuous life. What though the cross, presented to the view With all the humbling but momentous truths Inscribed on it, offend the pride of man? Shall it be hidden, or its truths effaced? Shall dying men be pleased rather than saved? When one who traverses some polar waste, Feels the benumbing influence of the cold Steal o'er him in a grateful drowsiness, Too strong to be resisted, and repays With bitter words, while sinking in the snow, The efforts of his comrades to alarm And rouse him, or support and drag him on, Is it philanthrophy to please, or save? Will not their hated care be recompensed, When, borne beyond the danger, and restored To feeling and to reason, he pours forth The weeping gratitude of a full heart? And will the kind severity, that seeks To rescue those seized by a lethargy, Ending, not broke, in ever-dying death, Receive a recompense of thanks less rich From the delivered. Or the transient scoff Of those delivered never, can this pain Like their eternal curse, and that of Heaven, For ministering an opiate to the soul, To gain its momentary favour here? Cruel the tenderness, that whispers peace To men at war with their Redeemer, men Who scorn his clemency, and dare his wrath! And O how false the friendship, that unites Preacher and hearer in the ruinous work Of mutual flattery!âthat together joins The sacred guide, and those who make him theirs, In travelling merrily on the high way Of sin and error, as the path to heaven, Praising its breadth and smoothness, each in turn Cheering and cheered, deceiving and deceived, Undoing and undone! Learn'd he may be, And eloquent, who yet the name deserves Of a false teacher, false in head and heart; But learning, with its boasted powers, arrayed Against the sweet simplicity of truth, And eloquence from counterfeited warmth, The painted passion of a mind at ease, How vain and pitiful in all their pride! He is the true ambassador of Heaven, Whose learning is the knowledge of the truth, Whose eloquence is that of piety Enlightened and impassionedânow a flame Of pure devotion rising to the skies, And now a stream of pure benevolence Poured down on man. Of such the mighty theme, That takes supreme possession of the soul, The bosom swelling, glowing on the lips, Is Christ, the Lord of Life, dying to give Blest immortality to wretched foes; Exchanging, in the plenitude of love, His own imperishable crown of light For man's mock diadem of wreathed thorns, The praise of angels for the scoff of worms, The infinite beatitude of heaven For pain unutterable on the cross. In man's redemption what o'erwhelming proof Of God's benevolence! From first to last 'Tis one stupendous scheme for doing good. 'Tis not the power and wisdom, though immense, But the unfathomable depth of love, In it disclosed, that makes it what it is, The hope of earth, the glory of the skies, Of both the wonder. Needless 'tis to seek Beyond it, for the excellence supreme Of heaven's Almighty, and his chief delight. But here, as if intent on robbing God Of goodness, in revenge for being compelled, Against the strongest wishes to confess E'en his existence, with a fiendlike joy The infidel exclaims, and thousands, wronged In their own view if ranked with him, repeat, With the same spirit the presumptuous cry, Why were men ruined only to be saved? Why all destroyed that part might be restored? No answer needs perversion of the truth So wilful, and its authors look for none, Content with the relief of vented hate. With thoughts less impious, others fondly ask, Why was man suffered to destroy himself? Why was there one by previous wickedness Prepared to tempt him to the fatal deed? Slept the Most High, while Satan, full of guile, Lurked in the bowers of Eden, to seduce From their allegiance the first happy pair? And after their revolt did he awake Like one surprised, and, not to be quite foiled By what was done and could not be undone, Resolve on their redemption as a shift, The best expedient of a straitened mind, An unforeseen dilemma to escape? Or held he, when rebellion in the breasts Of angels rose, the reins of government With hand relaxed, till sin had worked its way Into the heart of heaven? and then in wrath Resumed he them with more determined grasp, To drive it thence? Lacked he the knowledge, power, Or vigilance, its entrance to prevent? If not, why left he, in the universe, One door unbarred, by which this enemy Could gain admission? Why not shut it out From his whole kingdom with a single word, As he excludes it now, and will henceforth, From all the heavenly regions? Other cause Than his eternal will, acting in view Of good to be effected by its means Under his full controul, is sought in vain By groping mortals. Of its origin, Its first conception in a heart upright, And in the power, too, of the Holy One, They nothing know, and nothing need to know, But that, created free, angels and men Fell from the height of rectitude and bliss Divinely pure, by their own willing act, Nor thwarted in the least God's perfect plan Unalterable, nor involved in guilt His character with theirs. A mystery this! A truth to be believed, and not explained! The proud demand of mortals, that its depths Be fathomed, and laid open to their view, To gain their faith, is vain impiety. 'Tis prompted by a wish to take the throne, And, knowing good and evil, be as gods. Rather should thanks be offered, that while here That only is revealed to claim their thoughts, Which leads to present duty, and prepares For an eternity of light and joy. It best befits them, with absorbing awe, Childlike simplicity of mind and heart, And meek dependence on the Spirit of truth For needful aid, to make it their employ To learn what their Creator has declared In his pure oracles, and that receive Without a doubt or murmur, nor inquire Beyond it for the secrets of his will. On many a sacred page resemblance clear Of that sublimer good, from sin controlled By God's benevolence to be secured To his great kingdom, shines in some event Of transient date. The picture is complete; A hand divine has given, with matchless skill, The last bright touches; and their beauty strikes More for the previous shades and darker ground. The whole transaction meets the view at once; And, nothing doubting what part to ascribe To guilty men, what to their righteous King, We render homage, willing or constrained, To his transcendent grace, their wickedness Controlling, and directing to produce A tenfold blessing for the curse they meant: Their malice, burning only to destroy, He overrules in clemency to save. All darkness seems at first, and all along The following course; but on the close is poured A flood of light, whose splendour, shining back O'er the past gloom, reveals to our dim eyes The golden thread of providence benign Through the dark tissue drawn, and brighter far Than if around it all had been as bright. Since, then, in the events of days and years Our faint and limited vision oft discerns Evil, as used by the all-wise Supreme, To greater good redounding, wherefore doubt The like result of that grand system, formed Of these combined, as ocean of its drops? Will goodness infinite expend itself On these inferior parts, and leave the whole Without its care, to a disastrous fate? If either, sure the former were o'erlooked By heaven's great Monarch. Of his kind regard Both, as they need, receiving, both e'en now Were seen to be o'erruled alike for good Were they alike complete, and brought within The sphere of vision now the lot of man. Of God's whole plan, in its infinitude Of length and breadth, how little, in this state Of imperfection, can we mortals know! What influence of great moment hid from us The part revealed may have beyond itself, On universal being, none can tell. In his obscure economy below, Designs the Governor of all may have, Of which no human mind has ever dreamed. Earth, with its mingled scenes of good and ill, Judgment and mercy, to the universe For which he acts, may bear, beside its known, Other relations, of extent immense, And infinite weight. Were myriads of stars Made but for nightly lamps to this one globe, When hung so high in the cerulean vault, That all the feeble scattered rays, prolonged Down to this depth, scarce make the darkness less?â And when a single orb, low in the sky, Outshines them all? If, rather, like our own, Suns to attendant spheres they kindly roll; Rising and setting to give interchange Of light and darkness; vallies, hills, and plains Clothing with yearly or perennial fruits, And flowery verdure; shine they not to bless Creatures of rational immortal kind, Throughout their wide dominion? Or has God, All spirit and intelligence himself, And these esteeming infinitely best Of all his works, and when recorded stands His declaration, that he formed the earth To be inhabited, and not in vain, Built the whole fabric of celestial orbs But to exist a mass of matter void, A wilderness enormous, where are none Of the delightful sights and sounds of life, But awful silence, splendid barrenness And desolation? Ill conceived of thee, Father of lights! Thy wisdom prompts the thought That here must be the populous abodes Of beings, formed to serve thee, and enjoy. These all, perhaps, are sinless, and now reap The fruits of their obedience;âfeel no pain And fear no evil; in communion live With God and angels; and, forever near The world of glory, bask in its full blaze. And he, in understanding, may not err, More than in heart, who oft, at peaceful eve, Looks on the sky as filled with peopled orbs, Whence universal hymns of praise ascend To the third heavenâtill, earth and e'en himself Forgetting, living like a spirit free, In thoughts ethereal rapt, he seem to hear The distant melody. As in a day, When earth is darkened by thick stormy clouds, The sun, above those clouds, shines unobscured, Covering their restless waves with changing hues, Spangles, and rainbows; and on high is nought But one immensity of radiance bright, Of clear and tranquil beauty one expanse; So, in the intelligent creation, all Beyond this world and that of hell beneath, Beyond the gloom that overhangs this scene, All may be light, and purity, and peace, And perfect loveliness. This, and the world Infernal, may then, haply, be set forth Examples for the subjects of a realm Extended o'er the globes, the systems wide, Lighted by eighty millions of bright suns, Whose beams the telescope has brought to earth, And by those millions more, in the blue deep Yet undescriedâexamples for their good; The one of justice, for their warning given; The other of sweet mercy, for their faith. The Ruler of a kingdom thus immense In its extent, and weighty in its charge, Might deem it best that his whole character Be tried and proved; that righteousness and grace, Seeming at variance, be together brought In union wonderful, and thus displayed, Before all eyes, in living monuments, Like other attributes in other works. But cease these fancies! death may dissipate The whole at once, for a more glorious scene. To firmer ground I gladly turn for rest. Though on this theme, the wonder of the sage In every country, and the scoff of fools, In spite of reason and conjecture, much Remain unsolved, and must while time endures, Enough is seen in providence, and fixed By sacred promise, for unwavering trust, Till the full end, when vision will be full. Assured that sin the limit cannot pass Of Heaven's permission, that omnipotence Has bounded its proud waves, and that, at length, The eternal Being, who surveys the end From the beginning, will reveal its use, In that superior good, to be wrought out From all its evil, wherefore should we scorn The wisdom bidding us our murmurs hush And vain alarms, renounce our arguments And fond surmises, and in silence wait Till the great terminating scene arrive? Why should we be like savages untaught, Who, while the sun is shrouded in eclipse, Raise their tumultuous outcries, thence to drive The fancied monster, in their narrow view Extinguishing the luminary of day, When standing still an hour, with watching eye, Would show him moving onward as before, With lustre unimpaired? Why should we fear The blotting or diminishing of the light Of heaven and earth, the glory of their King, Ere the result of what may seem awhile Mysterious interruption? Why pronounce The scheme of providence in aught unwise Or undesirable, till it be known E'en to the end? The end is coming on; The issue of these mixed events below, The winding up of all terrestrial scenes; The day of consummation;âsolemn close Of past eternity, of that to come Beginning grand;âa common centre, both In one uniting, like a strait between Two shoreless oceans, at which all things meet, Their only passage;ârendezvous sublime Of angels and of men, in that dead pause Between the old creation and the new,â What time harmonious orbs in stillness wait, Their changes broken, for Jehovah's voice To bid their moving concert be resumed;â Of all things, great and small, evil and good, A full review, when the first heaven and earth Have pass'd away, and ere a second rise. The set time this to ope the sealed book Of providence, before assembled worlds. Come all and meditate the wondrous scenes, The joyful and the terrible, that pass In order, at the opening of each seal. See the disclosure, now, of hidden things In God's impartial plan; of others, wrapt In dubious gloom the evolution full. See now the clearing up of time's dark day, The clouds dispersed, the elements at rest, And all more beautiful than ere the storm: The sun sends forth a brighter blaze of beams; Glad nature rings with more melodious notes; And sweeter smiles, with renovated charms, Beneath a purer and serener sky. Thus when this growing system is mature; When it has reached its limits, and the day Set for the full review of its concerns Varied and countless, has arrived, and passed, Then shall the morning of eternity, Its inexpressible perfection show. 'Tis now like the creation in the midst Of that eventful week, in which the work Was in its progress under God's right hand, But half completed; when illumined here, There darksome still; exulting here with life, There wholly desolate; here finely formed, And there yet shapeless. But, as at the end Of that grand period the Creator viewed, With infinite delight, his finished works, And their surpassing excellence pronounced, So shall it be at the concluding scene Of checkered time. Then, too, the morning stars Shall sing together; the bright sons of God Shall shout for joy; and heaven a loud response From all her ransomed multitudes resound. Now from all quarters of the universe, Streams of pure glory, due to Him who thus In the supremacy of goodness reigns, Come pouring into paradise, that vast And central ocean. At the gathering flood Transported gaze, they, who for this result Waited with humble confidence in time. Of the Most High, his various works and ways, Immeasurably more they now behold In one glad hour, than, in their mortal state, Imagination, though by faith enlarged, And purified by love, had e'er conceived. All former knowledge shrinks to nothing now. The wisest of astronomers, when a child, What knew he of the sun, and starry hosts?â Their revolution, distance, magnitude, And order intricate and yet complete? What saw he in the lighted sky at eve, But twinkling sparks, as in the dusky air, Almost within the reach of his fond hands, Thrown upward in the wildness of delight? A Newton in his infancy, is he, Who, while on earth, is future heir of heaven. Yet, when, in full maturity, he comes To his inheritance, he but begins The glories of the Godhead to discern, And of a few know something; destined thence To make sublime advances without end, In this the only knowledge of true worth. More of that universal government, Established and administered in love, He still discovers, after ages spent In contemplation on the wondrous theme. As up the heights of immortality He climbs unwearied, to his ravished eye The prospect larger grows on every side, The firmament swells upward and around, While its apparent splendours every hour In number and in brilliancy increase. Thus, in progression endless, toward the Source Of light, move onward all the saints above, With joyful ardour, never to be quenched. But where are now the men of stubborn heart, Who, all the season allotted to make peace With their Creator, placable though just, Stood out against him? In what guise appear Before the last tribunal, they, who oft, Despising faith where comprehension fails, At reason's bar pronounced their Judge unjust, Because his footsteps were unsearchable, Now in the clouds, and now along the deep? They stand convinced, appalled, and silently Await their doom. Now the rebellious words, Utter'd against the providence of Heaven, Whene'r it frown'd on them, or seem'd to frown, Like arrows impiously and vainly shot, By Thracians, at the lowering thundercloud When low and near, on their own heads return In righteous vengeance. Now in agony They own the justice of the Lord of all, While under its condemning power they sink To uttermost perdition, the desert Of unrepented sin, their destiny Ordained by thee, thou Arbiter supreme. The certainty, and rectitude, of this Thy dread decree, what mortal dare deny? Great Lawgiver of all worlds, 'tis thine to fix The statutes of thy kingdom, and enforce Their due observance, by the penalty In thy unerring wisdom deem'd the best. No pleasure from the misery of his foes Can God derive; His character and word Forbid, that, like a tyrant, he should feast Upon their torments. His benevolence, Shown in the blessings lavished on them here; In that transcendent gift, forfeited heaven To purchase for them; in the offer made Of pardon on repenting, made again Oft as rejected, with entreaties pressed And warnings merciful, forbids the thought. But from their punishment, in its effects Upon a government with wisdom planned, He does derive such pleasure as becomes A gracious Monarch, who the welfare loves Of his whole kingdom, more than that of those Who break its sacred laws, madly abuse All clemency, and enemies remain Incorrigible. 'Tis the general weal, That calls for vengeance on the rebel's head. Thus justice to benevolence is changed, And judgment into mercy. Hell is made The woful dungeon of the universe, Where universal foes, and only such, In sad imprisonment forever lie. Its depths were hollowed out, its gloomy walls Raised, for the peace of heaven; and for the peace Of God's whole empire they remain, and will Until rebellion be no more a crime. Those everduring chains were forged in love Impartial; perfect goodness binds them on, And turns the fatal key, that locks up all, Who enter once that dreadful gate, unlocked To none returning. To the inmost seat Of feeling tortured by this thought, how writhe The guilty sufferers! Could they but discern, On the white throne above, the slightest stain Of cruelty or injustice, 'twere enough To give them fortitude to bear the worst. But how can they be strong, in hand or heart, To suffer or resist, when they behold Benevolence and equity combined, In their eternal exile from the climes Of light and happiness? How can they meet Love armed in the dread panoply of wrath, To take its righteous vengeance? How endure From their Redeemer to receive their doom? How can they stand before the Lamb incensed? The meek, the spotless, self-devoted Lamb? How will it give to their despair a sting Of keen and piercing agony, to think That He, who on the seat of judgment high, Arrayed in robes of majesty supreme, Sits to condemn them, is that Prince of Peace, Who once, in accents of compassion sweet, Of weeping condescension infinite, Pleaded for their acceptance of his love! Ah me! what bitterness, to drink, and drink Forever, of the cup of penal wrath Unmingled, from the hand that once held out The cup of free salvation; from that hand, Which always gladly healed the broken heart, And bound up all its wounds; from that same hand Once stretched upon the cross, streaming with blood! If, in that great development to come, Of all things hidden, sin reflect no blame On heaven's high Ruler, then will misery none; For, sin admitted, misery should ensue, Whither it goes should follow, where it dwells Should with it dwell, inseparably joined; A world of guilt should be a world of pain. And if, from the insufferable woes Of an undone eternity, no cry Of just reproach ascend to heaven, then none From all the slight calamities of time Can e'er ascend. But wherefore will not God, E'en now, from ills, on others brought, exempt The offspring of regenerating grace, The children of his love? Imperfect yet, They need the chastenings of paternal care, To save them from the wily blandishments Of error, and to win their hearts away From the polluting, ruining joys of earth. Though from its height of sole authority, O'er all the moving principles within, Sin be deposed, it struggles to regain Its lost dominion, till they half consent, When all their trust is not in borrowed might, To yield the conflict. Though his head be crushed, The serpent lives, and shows what spite he can, E'en till their sun go down. Not chastened then, No proof were given they were not past reform, And left as reprobate, to be prepared By mercies for an aggravated doom. See they not often now, and will they not Hereafter see, that when they murmured most They should have sung the highest notes of praise? When from the skies they cast a look below, Methinks they will esteem their path too smooth And level, for transgressors bound to heaven. O, had it been a steeper, rougher ascent, Then had they risen more rapidly, and gained An exaltation of superior bliss! Becomes it them, to eye with sad distrust, That hand of a compassionate Parent, laid Heavily on them, while for their support His other is extended underneath, And filled with richer blessings in reserve? Should they not rather welcome the kind stroke, That humbles but to fit them for a throne? Should they not even beg their heavenly Guide To bar up, or to plant with thorns, each path, However flowery, that would lead astray; And to imbitter all forbidden fruit Soliciting their taste, however fair? Were not the world to them unlovely made, Heaven were forgotten, or without desire Remembered, and without foretasting faith. Like the thick grove, that only when deprived Of its gay foliage, through it shows, beyond, Green fields, the ocean, the resplendent sky, Earth must be stript of charms, to let them see The loveliness of paradise beyond, The vast bright prospect of eternity. Were nothing but enjoyment theirs below, Were all prosperity, their hearts were here, And here their portion. Were they undisturbed, Their day of trial were spent in fatal sleep. 'Tis when the world disowns them, turns them out From every resting place as none of hers, That they pursue with quick and vigorous step Their pilgrimage, and muse upon its end With panting hope and elevating joy. When by affliction purified, and weaned From sublunary toys, with what delight They cleave to Him in whose embrace is found The only rest, and welcome the approach Of that great change of being, to be passed Only to wing them for a speedy flight Into his unveiled presence, there to find Pleasures augmented by griefs left below! There, long possessed, the due inheritance Of angels, whom no suffering ever reached, Is sweet indeed; but, the reward of saints, Rest after toil, and after conflict peace, Light out of darkness, out of sorrow joy, Life from the grave, and paradise from earth, Nay, from the brink of hell, how passing sweet! There with what loveliness the spirit shines, When, through afflictions, from defilement deep Raised to angelic purity, from death To the perfection of celestial life! So from the filthy bottom of the pool, Up through its waters, to the surface springs The lily, and there blooms a perfect flower, Of brilliant whiteness, beautifully pure. And what more lovely object here below, Or more exalted, than a mortal, weak And tender, looking upward in the midst Of painful visitations, with an eye By faith illumined, and a brow serene From heartfelt peace and acquiescence full In Heaven's high will; and out of deep distress Rising invigorated, and prepared For generous deeds impossible before? 'Tis resignation, so unfeigned, entire, And happy, by severe affliction proved, When nature in her tenderness resists, That shines the fairest victory of grace. In early wedlock joined, when all things wore An aspect bright with promised happiness, Orville and Charlotte were a pair beloved For intellectual and moral worth; For knowledge, both the useful and refined. Taste uncorrupt, feeling benevolent, Sweetness of temper, gentleness of mien, And undissembled piety, the soul Of all their virtues. Undisturbed, awhile, In their felicity, they passed along, One in their studies, duties, pleasures pure, Guiding and guided each, blessing and blessed. Sweet intercourse between congenial minds! And sweeter interchange of kindred hearts! Together they with like devotion scanned The heavenly orbs, traversed the map of earth With equal skill, dwelt on her history With like astonishment at human crimes And God's forbearance, to exalted verse Gave vocal melody with equal gust. Nor did they for the fashionable muse The classic quite forsake. Nigh them they kept The poet of humanity and truth, Of simple nature and religion pure, The lovely Cowper; and, at every word Against his fame, felt wounded in a friend. Nor to the crowded shelf, to be forgot, Was Milton e'er removed;âseraphic bard! Sweetly sublime, in paradise above! In paradise below, sublimely sweet! There lofty numbers, and melifluous here, Grandeur and beauty every where, command Breathless attention, and within them wake Those finer strings, that, at the thrilling touch Of mighty genius, quiver with keen delight. Together over flowery fields and woods They rambled, in the not unuseful search Of plants to be inspected in each part, With nicety botanic; nor e'en passed Unheeded any delicate shapely brake, Or tuft of moss, upon bleak mountain rocks, Like frostwork, fine, and white, and crumbling quick Beneath the foot; on the low shady bank, Like velvet, green and soft, or like a grove Of pines inch-high, with noiseless pliancy All bending prostrate at the lightest tread, Or gentlest pressure of the stroking hand, Then with elastic liveliness again Rising unhurt. Not less in these minute, Than in the vast of the Creator's works, They loved to trace his hand, in every touch Inimitably fair. The house of want, Of ignorance, of mourning, of disease, Together oft they humbly cheered with alms, Instruction, sympathy, attendance kind. Each weekly and each daily season, made Sacred to acts of worship, with delight Duly observing, oft, at other times, They knelt together in devotion sweet, As aught of signal interest called for thanks, Or supplications of appropriate warmth; And oft, at other times, together sung, Not unassisted by the solemn chord, Anthems of praise. Thus happily they lived, Till, in their arms, a second pleasant babe With a faint smile intelligent began To answer theirs, and with a brighter that Of its fond sister, standing by their side, With frequent kisses prattling in its face; While in its features, with parental joy, And love connubial, they began to mark Theirs intermingled;âwhen, with sudden stroke, The blooming infant faded, and expired. And soon its lonely sister, doubly dear Now in their grief, was in like manner torn From their united grasp. With patience far Beyond her years, the little sufferer bore Her sharp distemper, while she could behold Both parents by her side; but, when from sleep Transient and troubled waking, wept aloud, As terrified, if either were not there. To hear their voices singing of the love Of her Redeemer, in her favourite hymn, And praying for his mercy, oft she asked With eagerness, and seemed the while at ease. When came the final struggle, with the look Of a grieved child, and with its mournful cry, But still with something of her wonted tone Of confidence in danger, as for help, She called on them, on both alternately, As if by turns expecting that relief From each the other had grown slow to yield; At which their calmness, undisturbed till then, Gave way to agitation past control. A few heart-rending moments, and her voice Sunk to a weak and inarticulate moan, Then in a whisper ended; and with that Her features grew composed and fixed in death; At sight of which their lost tranquillity At once returned. 'Twas evening; and the lamp, Set near, shone full upon her placid face, Its snowy white illuming, while they stood Gazing as on her loveliness in sleep, The enfeebled mother on the father's arm Heavily hanging, like the slender flower On its firm prop, when loaded down with rain Or morning dew; and laying her pale cheek Upon his shoulder, with the simple air Of infant weakness and dependence sweet. Their lifeless child they tenderly bemoaned, Yet opened their sad hearts, and not in vain, To holy consolation from on high. With unrepining sorrow, they beheld That little cherished frame of beauteous clay Apparelled for the grave, and covered deep In its cold bosom. When, day after day, No cheering sound of playful childhood broke The stillness of their dwelling, and they felt The new uneasiness of empty arms, They sometimes wept together, but in tears Showed a submissive look, almost a smile. Now came the last and sorest in the train Of their afflictions, the dissolving blow To nature's first and most endearing ties. By her loved little ones, ere yet the turf Upon their graves its unsoiled green regained, Charlotte, the amiable wife was laid; And thus the partner of her bosom left, To mourn in solitude the loss of all. By her bed side, with unremitted care, In all her painful sickness, day and night, He watched, anticipating every want, And sharing every pang. From a full heart, Now audibly, now silently he poured Incessant supplications for her life, Or happiness in death; and when the hope Of her recovery failed, with gratitude He saw unshaken to the last, her trust In His compassion, whom in health she served With willing mind. Her end was full of peace, Fitting her uniform piety serene. 'Twas rather the deep humble calm of faith, Than her high triumph; and resembled more The unnoticed setting of a clear day's sun, Than his admired departure in a blaze Of glory bursting from a clouded course. When from her burial to his home returned The broken-hearted Orville, and beheld Around all still, all desolate within, A feeling of his utter loneliness Rushed on his soul with overwhelming power. Entering his door ungreeted and unmet, Missing her face that always brightened quick At his approach, her voice that sweeter grew, On the first seat presented, down at once, As if all strength were in a moment gone, He sunk, dissolving in a flood of tears; Then, rising suddenly, walked to and fro, And in impassioned accents mourned aloud. When at his table, in her wonted seat He first beheld another; when he saw The last unfinished labours of her hand;â Her needle, pen, and pencil, at his wish, Untouched remaining, just as left by her;â And when he cast an eye upon her plants Perrenial, and her aromatic shrubs, In their neat vases, left unwatered long, Dropping untimely leaves and blighted buds; His rising grief no effort could suppress. If in his house, through its disordered rooms, He wandered, or through alleys weedy grown In his neglected garden, or along The sylvan walks of her accustomed choice, At every step, some object called to mind Her worth, or her affection, and thus kept Opening afresh the wound within his breast. Yet though severely pained, he ne'er refused, In sullen or in passionate despair, The sympathy of friendship; ne'er returned With coldness the warm pressure of the hand, Nor heard unmoved from undissembling lips Gentle condolence. E'en the pity shown By giddy youth, in checking their loud mirth While passing his lone dwelling, with an eye Turned toward it oft, attracted by the sight Of doors all closed and window curtains down, Touched him with grateful joy, while it awaked A sigh at the remembrance of his loss. But other consolation, far above Whate'er this world of vanity can yield, He needed, with etherial fervour sought, And in abundance found. So full his trust, So high his joy, in Him, whose government Is always equitable, always good, And to the penitent of human kind In all things merciful, that they who looked, At first, to see his tender nature sink, Ere long with admiration saw it changed To exalted firmness;ânot, indeed, his own; Not the quick growth of philosophic pride, But of the infused virtue of that grace From heaven descending. In his grief, he seemed Like the young tree, bowed low, as from its top Some strong hand tears away the clinging vine, Breaks by degrees the innumerable ties Of branches and soft tendrils intertwined, But, when quite parted, rising, and, despoiled Of all its own with all its borrowed bloom, Standing, in naked loneliness, sublime. Thus stript, a solitary being, left To feel united to the earth no more By any outward bond, he looked on all That he possessed, once valued for the sake Of others dearer than himself, as now No longer his, to be enjoyed alone; And with a richer treasure in his view, Restored it to the Giver, to augment The knowledge of his will, and of his grace The victories, among immortal men. Not in a fit of discontented gloom, But with the sober constancy of faith, He viewed himself thenceforth a stranger here, And looked on all the world, in all its charms, As nought to him, intent upon his home, And on whatever intervening means Might best and soonest fit him for its joys. By learning and meek piety prepared To be the messenger of truth and grace, Now doubly by affliction, and desire Benevolent kindled to a quenchless flame, And inly prompted by the Spirit divine Inhabiting his bosom, forth he went From all the abodes of elegance and ease, To publish in the wilderness, to men In mind and manners rude, dwelling in huts Uncouth and comfortless, the welcome words Of heavenly mercy, through the ransom high On Calvary paid. From hardships, that would once Have crushed him, gathering vigour in his course, Onward till death, in this angelic work, He pressed, with growing ardour and delight. When in the great assembly of the just, Walking in white,âhis happy wife and babes, Beautiful cherubs, smiling at his side,â He meets with those by his exertion saved, Beholds their glory, hears their rapturous songs, And, forward looking with an angel's ken Along the vista of unlimited years, Contemplates their uninterrupted march In excellence and bliss, and in them views Immortal trophies of the Prince of Life, Forever yielding honour to the love Omnipotent of this his dearest friend, How will the day of his bereavement here, Like morning, break from its terrestial gloom, And shine of all his days most luminous In heaven's reflected and concentred light! And how will his unchanging confidence In God's mysterious goodness, with its fruits Of rich and lasting growth, the height sublime Of wisdom prove, and virtue, to the joy Triumphant of his never-ending life! If such the future good, the glory bright, The bliss ineffable, of them that bear, With holy fortitude of heart, the ills Of vile mortality, and rise beneath The accumulated weight to higher deeds, Then let the deepest in affliction lift The drooping head, beneath the heaviest load, And, fired with hope, run with unfaltering step Their sublunary course. The woes of earth May thicken, and severer grow, till death; But that last pang, like the last paroxysm Of some long painful dream, waking the soul To life and transport, makes amends at once For all past sufferings, in a moment all Forgotten in that plenitude of joy. And if so glorious be the end of faith, In that good providence, minutely employed On its possessor; faith in God's kind care Of his great kingdom of victorious grace, With what transcendent glory will it reach Its consummation! Of this last reward E'en now the frequent prelibation cheers The saddened spirit, when events within This rising kingdom, seeming for a while Disastrous, turn to unexpected good, In greatness and extent surpassing far The threatened ill. The good man, eminent In station and endowments, one to whom The virtuous of whole nations look with joy And expectation high, dies in the prime Of active excellence; but soon, to calm The general grief, and all distrust reprove, From his removal are divinely wrought, And visibly to all, effects above The highest ever hoped from life prolonged. Few are the days, in which the friends of man, With looks of fearful sorrow, when they meet, Untimely and calamitous pronounce His early death. On all the darkness thick, Involving it at first, light shines anon, With added glory; as when radiance bright, After the sun's departure in deep gloom, Suddenly shines on all the clouds of heaven, And adds a splendour richer than of day. In grand pre-eminence o'er every truth Rises the goodness, pure and measureless, Of that eternal Being, in whose hands Are all things, at his sole disposal held, And with a grasp that nothing can resist. No matter what is truth, if this be not; All is forever lost; despair like death Reigns, and a horror of great darkness spreads, O'er a lost universe. If this be truth, No matter what is not; all, all is safe; The living light of hope creation cheers. This is enough for creatures of the dust To know of their great Maker; of his will And providence, in all their mysteries. Let this suffice the wavering to confirm, To hush the murmuring, and the sinking raise; To drive from every breast rebellious thoughts And sorrowful, and win the love supreme Of every heart, the confidence entire; And into each infuse divine delight, Unmingled and unfailing as its source. Sublimer consolation heaven has none To give to mortals, no sublimer joy For angels, than from the assurance flows, That all is goodness in the government, And in the character, of Him who reigns Head over all things; that his holiness Is but benevolence kindled to a flame, Refining and consuming for like end, His wisdom but the knowledge and the will To make the height of happiness secure, His justice a wall of fire about his throne To guard it from defilement ruinous, His truth the immutability of grace, And his omnipotence the might of love. Great is thy goodness, Father of all life, Fount of all joy. Thou high and holy One, Whom not thy glorious sanctuary, heaven, Can e'er contain; Spirit invisible, Whose omnipresence makes creation smile, Great is thy goodness, worthy of all praise From all thy works. Then let earth, air, and sea; Nature, with every season in its turn; The firmament, with its revolving fires; And all things living; join to give thee praise. Thou glorious sun, like thy Original, A vital influence to surrounding worlds Forever sending forth, yet always full; And thou fair queen of night, o'er the pure sky, Amid thy glittering company of stars, Walking in brightness, praise the God above. Ocean, forever rolling to and fro In thy vast bed, o'er half the hollowed earth; Grand theatre of wonders to all lands, And reservoir of blessings, sound his praise. Break forth into a shout of grateful joy, Ye mountains, covered with perennial green, And pouring crystal torrents down your sides; Ye lofty forests, and ye humble groves; Ye hills, and plains, and valleys, overspread With flocks and harvests. All ye feathered tribes, That, taught by your Creator, a safe retreat Find in the dead of winter, or enjoy Sweet summer all your days by changing clime, Warble to him all your melodious notes; To him, who clothes you with your gay attire, And kindles in your fluttering breasts the glow Of love parental. Beasts, that graze the fields, Or roam the woods, give honour to the Power, That makes you swift to flee, or strong to meet, The coming foe; and rouses you to flight In harmless mirth, or sooths to pleasant rest. Shout to Jehovah with the voice of praise, Ye nations, all ye continents and isles, People of every tongue; ye that within The verdant shade of palm and plantain sit, Feasting on their cool fruit, on torrid plains; And ye that in the midst of pine-clad hills, In snowy regions, grateful vigour inhale From every breeze. Ye, that inhabit lands, Where science, liberty, and plenty dwell, Worship Jehovah in exalted strains. But ye, to whom redeeming mercy comes, With present peace, and promises sublime Of future crowns, and mansions in the skies, Imperishable, raise the loudest song. O, sing forever, with seraphic voice, To Him, whose immortality is yours, In the blest union of eternal love! And join them, all ye winged hosts of heaven, That in your Maker's glory take delight; And ye, too, all ye bright inhabitants Of starry worlds; and let the universe, Above, below, around, be filled with praise. Though held thus long in contemplation sweet On heaven's high King, I may not leave his court Till I have marked the godlike myriads Of bright intelligences, that attend In state celestial, ranged in order round His throne adoring; at his bidding fly, Swiftly and silently as beams of light, From world to world, to execute his will; From their creation this their blest employ, And theirs for an eternity to come. Not from the need of their almighty Lord, To propagate the impulse of his hand Beyond its reach, serve they throughout his realm. Nor is his service deemed a menial task; 'Tis their high privilege, their whole delight. Were they disbanded, and employed no more, Their hearts would pine as o'er departed bliss, Their station forfeited, their glory lost. On errand sent of love or righteous wrath, They oft appeared on earth, from that sad hour When cherubs stood to guard, with sword of flame, Fair paradise and its live-giving tree From all access of banished ruined man, To that most memorable day, when heaven Sent down the flower of her exulting hosts, To celebrate his birth in Bethlehem born. Him they acknowledged as their Sovereign still, Though clad in flesh, and to his human wants Administered while in the lonely wild, Strengthened his mortal frame when in the shades Of sad Gethsemane it almost sunk, Borne down by that insufferable load Of a world's guilt; and legions, hovering near, Gazing with trembling wonder, waited leave To screen from danger his devoted head, And pour contempt and ruin on his foes. In shining garments mighty angels came, To ope the tomb, and hail their rising Lord; And came againâlet gently down to earth The golden cloud that bore him up the sky, And them who gazed of his last coming warned. That coming all his angels shall attend, The trump to sound, and gather his elect From the four winds, ere his avenging wrath Come on the world, and bury it in flames. Meanwhile they minister to saints below, The tempted to deliver, and to guide The wandering; hope to whisper to the sad, And to the dying peace. Round the death bed They take their stand, with wings invisible And noiseless fan upon the burning brow The cooling air, and light the lifted eye With glimpses of celestial glory bright. They wait, with arms extended, to receive The liberated spirit, and up to climes Of immortality, their happy home, Bear it with the rapidity of thought. Benevolence reigns a passion in their breasts, While in the presence of their King they stand, Begirt to fly the moment when he bids. It spreads their pinions, quickens, and supports, And guides them far and wide, on every wind, Downward, and upward, and along the earth From land to land, wherever virtue dwells. Listening delighted, in assemblies, met To join entreaties for the coming quick Of the great kingdom of redeeming love, They mingle; and in those of every name, Combined its promised welfare to promote. They cheer with glad attendance them that go, Life to the dying nations to proclaim; And with the tidings of each penitent Hasten to heaven, to give new rapture there. And if o'er one regenerated soul They all rejoice, what shouts of joy, increased A thousand fold, shall burst from glowing lips, Ring round and round the everlasting hills, From choir to choir repeated long and loud, And swell the whole grand chorus of the skies, When in one day a nation shall be born! A Gabriel's now is every humbler harp, And his attuned to notes unheard before. If angels bear a beggar to the skies, If they have borne home solitary saints, Amidst unholy millions well nigh lost, How will the air and heavens be all alive, With motion swifter than the lightning flash, From their ascending and descending bands, Meeting, and intermingling, night and day, When from each shore, and island of the sea, And mount, and vale, around the populous globe, Spirits regenerate shall depart each hour, In all a countless throng! From heaven to earth Pass and repass bright angels, in a train So constant, and so thick, they lighten up Another galaxy along the sky, A radiant pathway o'er the starry realm To realms of bliss. Behold the saints ascend, No longer one by one, and far apart; They go in companies, they fly like clouds Of sunny whiteness, on a vernal day, Hurrying in thick succession o'er the heavens; In one continual multitude they rise. Oft hovering for a moment, on their way, To clap their pinions with triumphant joy, Angels attend them; angels, too, on watch, Look from the garnished battlements of heaven, Their coming to proclaim, soon as beheld, Far down, a living constellation, fast Ascending, widening, brightening, shedding light On the dim orbs that roll around its path. Their city's twelve transparent gates of pearl, Till this glad day all barred save one alone, Angels with joyful haste throw open wide, To let whole armies in; and angels pour From each, to greet them, with endearing words, And smiles benignant; and through dazzling ranks, Into the centre of their blest abode, Before that face whose glory is their sun, Conduct them, all, with tuneful voices loud, And the sweet symphony of golden harps, Uniting in hosannas to the Lamb. While thus with all the native sons of heaven, In their adoring acclamations, join Those ransomed from the earth, they feel the fire Of their benevolence, in its purity, Burning within, enkindling joy like theirs, And prompting to like action. Yes, the love Of giving and beholding happiness, First wakened in their hearts amid the sins, The griefs, and frailties, of mortality, When these remain no more to chill its zeal, Shall live, the bosom's sole inhabitant; There reign, and to angelic fervour rise. Love is the only amaranthine flower, In this inclement world, this land of death. While faith and hope, are blasted in the grave, The wintry grave, with other flowers of time, Thou, sacred charity, shalt still survive, And in a soil and clime, where all is life, Shalt grow, and flourish, in eternal spring, And with unwasting sweetness fill the groves And vales of paradise. There all is love, In every happy breast, through every rank, E'en to the humblest; love without a taint Of hidden selfishness, without a drop Of bitterness, from fear, or hope deferred. None pine with jealousy, at sight of bliss Their own transcending. To behold a crown Of fairer light than theirs, or hear a harp More tuneful, wakens discontent in none, But livelier joy. The happiness of each Is ever that of all. Love makes the heaven Of every bosom; gives to every face Its winning beauty, to the cheek its bloom Unfading, to the lips their living glow, Its pure etherial lustre to the eye, And to the whole its everlasting smile. On all the multitudes, spread o'er the plains Of immortality, from his high throne The God of love, through the transparent cloud Of glory round him, casts a fixed look Of calm complacence, in their union sweet Rejoicing, in their charity sublime, In their consummate likeness to himself. END OF BOOK I. EXTRACTS FROM BOOK II. Descending to this sublunary orb, From the third heaven th' empyreal realm of love, Its native element, (sublimely pure, And all pervading) how am I thrown, As from the glowing centre of the sun, Down to earth's frozen and benighted pole. Will no kind visitant from heaven, reveal By what unerring sign apostate man May know himself preparing to regain Lost paradise, its innocence and bliss? Tis nothing less than that same image lost, Effaced by sin, new stamp'd upon the soul. What else, but God's own likeness, could prepare Angel or man, his presence to enjoy? What, but the temper of the heavenly world Could fit a being to be happy there? This temper and that likeness meet in love. Love is the watch-word at the gate of heav'n. Religion comes to mortals richly fraught With this celestial grace, and scatters round Its heav'n-born fragrance in this distant soil, As spices, when exposed in foreign climes, Breathe out the native odours of their own. Time well employ'd is Satan's deadliest foe: It leaves no opening for the lurking fiend: Life it imparts to watchfulness and prayer, Statues, without it in the form of guards. The closet which the saint devotes to prayer, Is not his temple only, but his tower, Whither he runs for refuge, when attack'd, His armory, to which he soon retreats When danger warns, his weapons to select, And fit them on. He dares not stop to plead When taken by surprise and half o'ercome, That now to venture near the hallow'd place Were but profane; a plea that marks a soul Glad to impose on conscience with a show Of humble veneration, to secure Present indulgence, which, when once enjoy'd, It means to mourn with floods of bitter tears. The tempter quits his vain pursuit and flies, When by the mounting suppliant drawn too near The upper world of purity and light. He loses sight of his intended prey, In that effulgence beaming from the throne Radiant with mercy. But devotion fails To succour and preserve the tempted soul, Whose time and talents rest or run to waste. Ne'er will the incense of the morn diffuse A salutary savour through the day, With charities and duties not well filled. These form the links of an electric chain That join the orisons of morn and eve, And propagate through all its several parts, While kept continuous, the etherial fire; But if a break be found the fire is spent. Too long I've wandered, though by truth led on; But still the strong enchantment which unmans The pensive lovers of the calm sublime, And which, unbroke, upon the lap of ease Lays them to sleep, wrapt up in selfish gloom Unmindful of the claims of social life, Demands regard, ere yet I quite return. How rich in scenes that nurse in pensive souls A tenderness voluptuously soft, Till grown to indolent and morbid gloom, Fatal to active usefulness, to peace with heaven, Is nature's varied field. A mind in love With mournful musing, never turns in vain To nature for some dear congenial scene; But scenes there are, so fraught with soothing power, They woo the pensive mind when unemployed. A sultry noon, not in the summer's prime When all is fresh with life, and youth, and bloom, But near its close when vegetation stops, And fruits mature, stand ripening in the sun, Sooths and enervates with its thousand charms, Its images of silence and of rest, The melancholy mind. The fields are still; The husbandman has gone to his repast, And, that partaken, on the coolest side Of his abode, reclines, in sweet repose. Deep in the shaded stream the cattle stand, The flocks beside the fence, with heads all prone And panting quick. The fields for harvest ripe, No breezes bend in smooth and graceful waves, While with their motion, dim and bright by turns, The sun-shine seems to move; nor e'en a breath Brushes along the surface with a shade, Fleeting and thin, like that of flying smoke. The slender stalks, their heavy bended heads Support as motionless, as oaks their tops. O'er all the woods the top-most leaves are still, E'en the wild poplar leaves, that, pendant hung By stems elastic, quiver at a breath, Rest in the general calm. The thistle down Seen high and thick, by gazing up beside Some shading object, in a silver shower Plumb down, and slower than the slowest snow, Through all the sleepy atmosphere descends; And where it lights, though on the steepest roof, Or smallest spire of grass, remains unmoved. White as a fleece, as dense and as distinct From the resplendent sky, a single cloud On the soft bosom of the air becalmed, Drops a lone shadow as distinct and still, On the bare plain, or sunny mountain's side; Or in the polished mirror of the lake, In which the deep reflected sky appears A calm sublime immensity below. Beneath a sun That crowns the centre of the azure cope, A blaze of light intense o'erspreads the whole Of nature's face; and he that overlooks, From some proud eminence, the champaign round, Notes all the buildings, scattered far and near, Both great and small, magnificent and mean, By their smooth roofs of shining silver white, Spangling with brighter spots the bright expanse. No sound, nor motion, of a living thing The stillness breaks, but such as serve to soothe Or cause the soul to feel the stillness more. The yellow-hammer by the way-side picks, Mutely, the thistle's seed; but in her flight, So smoothly serpentine, her wings outspread To rise a little, closed to fall as far, Moving like sea-fowl o'er the heaving waves, With each new impulse chimes a feeble note. The russet grasshopper, at times, is heard, Snapping his many wings, as half he flies, Half hovers in the air. Where strikes the sun With sultriest beams, upon the sandy plain, Or stony mount, or in the close deep vale, The harmless locust of this western clime, At intervals, amid the leaves unseen, Is heard to sing with one unbroken sound, As with a long-drawn breath, beginning low, And rising to the midst with shriller swell, Then in low cadence dying all away. Beside the stream collected in a flock, The noiseless butterflies, though on the ground, Continue still to wave their open fans Powder'd with gold; while on the jutting twigs The spindling insects that frequent the banks, Rest, with their thin transparent wings outspread As when they fly. Oft times, though seldom seen, The cuckoo, that in summer haunts our groves, Is heard to moan, as if at every breath Panting aloud. The hawk in mid-air high, On his broad pinions sailing round and round, With not a flutter, or but now and then, As if his trembling balance to regain, Utters a single scream but faintly heard, And all again is still. The cooling shade The listless rambler seeks, perhaps beside Sad willows planted round the garden pool, Whose slender leaves and long untapering limbs Hanging plumb down with gracefulness, Drip with a constant shower of scattered drops Hung from the spouting column in the midst; Or in the forest by the clear cold rill, That falls in short cascades as by thick steps Down the long steep, mid slaty stones o'ergrown With fresh green moss, beneath the umbrage dark Of pine and fir: while oozing from the rocks Trickle cold springs, and on the banks, the cups Of flowers unsunned, day after day, retain The rain of heaven. Here musing he reclines, Cooled by the freshness, by the murmurs lulled, And softly saddened by the verdant gloom. At evening in the unfrequented door, Fronting the west, he takes his wonted stand, Leaning against the post with folded arms; Or at his chamber window, open thrown, He seats himself, his forehead bared to meet Each cooling breeze, his elbow on the sill, And his bare temple resting on his palm. He looks abroad and much he finds to please A soul depressed and sink it lower still. The meadows are no longer spangled bright As ere mid-summer, with the nightly swarms Of fireflies thick, whose intermittent sparks Direct the hands of childhood, following close To catch them as they climb the blades of grass, Or flit along the air. Now other swarms Of various insects in the grass unseen, Sooth with a dull monotony of sounds; Some shriller than the rest in minute strains Trilling alone; and some without a stop All night prolonged in feeble plaintive tones Continuous as the throbbings of the pulse And similar as they. Far off and low in The horizon, from a sultry cloud Where sleeps in embryo the mid-night storm, The silent lightning gleams in fitful sheets, Illumes the solid mass, revealing thus Its darker fragments, and its ragged verge; Or if the bolder fancy so conceive Of its fantastic forms, revealing thus Its gloomy caverns, rugged sides and tops With beetling cliffs grotesque. But not so bright The distant flashes gleam as to efface The window's image on the floor impressed, By the dim crescent; or outshines the light Cast from the room upon the trees hard by, If haply to illume a moonless night The lighted taper shine; though lit in vain To waste away unused, and from abroad Distinctly through the open window seen Lone, pale, and still as a sepulchral lamp. The sultry summer past, September comes, Soft twilight of the slow-declining year. All mildness, soothing loneliness and peace; The fading season ere the falling come, More sober than the buxom blooming May, And therefore less the favorite of the world, But dearest month of all to pensive minds. Tis now far spent; and the meridian sun Most sweetly smiling with attempered beams Sheds gently down a mild and grateful warmth. Beneath its yellow lustre groves and woods Checkered by one night's frost with various hues, While yet no wind has swept a leaf away, Shine doubly rich. It were a sad delight Down the smooth stream to glide, and see it tinged Upon each brink with all the gorgeous hues, The yellow, red, or purple of the trees That singly or in tufts or forests thick Adorn the shores; to see perhaps the side Of some high mount reflected far below With its bright colours, intermixed with spots Of darker green. Yes it were sweetly sad To wander in the open fields and hear E'en at this hour, the noon-day hardly past, The lulling insects of the summer's night; To hear, where lately buzzing swarms were heard, A lonely bee long roving here and there To find a single flower, but all in vain; Then rising quick and with a louder hum, In widening circles round and round his head, Straight by the listener flying clear away, As if to bid the fields a last adieu; To hear within the woodland's sunny side, Late fall of music, nothing save perhaps The sound of nut-shells by the squirrel dropt From some tall beech fast falling through the leaves. The sun now rests upon the mountain tops; Begins to sink behindâis half concealed, And now is gone: the last faint twinkling beam Is cut in twain by the sharp rising ridge. Sweet to the pensive is departing day When only one small cloud so still and thin, So thoroughly imbued with amber light, And so transparent, that it seems a spot Of brighter sky, beyond the farthest mount Hangs o'er the hidden orb; or where a few Long narrow stripes of denser, darker grain, At each end sharpened to a needle's point With golden borders, sometimes straight and smooth And sometimes crinkling like the lightning stream, A half hour's space above the mountain lie; Or when the whole consolidated mass That only threatened rain, is broken up Into a thousand parts, and yet is one, One as the ocean broken into waves; And all its spongy parts, imbibing deep The moist effulgence, seem like fleeces dyed Deep scarlet, saffron light, or crimson dark, As they are thick or thin, or near or more remote, All fading soon as lower sinks the sun, Till twilight end. But now another scene To me most beautiful of all appears; The sky without the shadow of a cloud Throughout the west, is kindled to a glow So bright and broad, it glares upon the eye, Not dazzling but dilating with calm force Its power of vision to admit the whole. Below, 'tis all of richest orange dye, Midway the blushing of the mellow peach Paints not but tinges the etherial deep; And here in this most lovely region shines With added loveliness, the evening-star. Above, the fainter purple slowly fades Till changed into the azure of mid-heaven. Along the level ridge o'er which the sun Descended, in a single row arranged As if thus planted by the hand of art, Majestic pines shoot up into the sky, And in its fluid gold seem half dissolved. Upon a nearer peak, a cluster stands With shafts erect and tops converged to one A stately colonade with verdant roof; Upon a nearer still, a single tree With shapely form looks beautiful alone, While farther northward through a narrow pass Scooped in the hither range, a single mount Beyond the rest, of finer smoothness seems, And of a softer more etherial blue, A pyramid of polished sapphire built. But now the twilight mingles into one The various mountains; levels to a plain This nearer, lower landscape, dark with shade, Where every object to my sight presents Its shaded side; while here upon these walls And in that eastern wood upon the trunks Under thick foliage, reflective shows Its yellow lustre. How distinct the line Of the horizon parting heaven and earth. In such a night, 'twould sadden mirth to hear The lulling sound of distant waterfalls By intervening hills so broke and spread That whence it comes the ear no more discerns, Seeming diffused alike on every side, A gentle murmur filling all the air; As if all nature charg'd with life intense, Breathed softly in one universal sigh, The thrilling tones of an Eolian harp In such a night would half entrance the sad, Its deep vibrations, shook from chords that quake As with the touch of quiv'ring fingers hid From mortal sight, would sink into the soul And half persuade fond fancy that the hand Of some departed sympathizing friend Dearly beloved and deeply mourned, was there. Now drowned in sweet repose are man and beast, While swift and silent as on angel's wings Time by them flies. 'Tis midnight: o'er the marshy meadows rest Damp vapours thin and pale; while overhead Hangs far aloft beneath the firmament, And just beneath, a cloudy canopy, Milk-white and curdled in thick spots, oft called The seeds of coming rain, but to the eye Of fancy seeming like a flock of swans In mid-air hovering still. All nature sleeps Beneath a tranquillizing shower of light. O what a night for grief to watch and weep. I seem alone 'mid universal death, Lone as a single sail upon the sea, Lone as a wounded swan, that leaves the flock To heal in secret or to bleed and die. 'Tis morn once more, and morning with my song. The muse awakes from her long nightly dream, And summons truth to interpret it by day. If she divine aright, to such as seek For solitude and peace in scenes like these, A mild delirium to enjoy secure And nurse a tender gloom, it bodes no good, But useless life and miserable age. EXTRACTS FROM BOOK III. Who scorn the hallowed day, set heaven at naught. Heav'n would wear out whom one short sabbath tires. Emblem and earnest of eternal rest, A festival with fruits celestial crown'd, A jubilee releasing him from earth, The day delights and animates the saint. It gives new vigour to the languid pulse Of life divine; restores the wandering feet, Strengthens the weak, upholds the prone to slip, Quickens the lingering, and the sinking lifts, Establishing them all upon a rock. Sabbaths, like way-marks, cheer the pilgrim's path, His progress mark, and keep his rest in view. In life's bleak winter they are pleasant days, Short foretastes of the long, long spring to come. To every new-born soul, each hallowed morn Seems like the first when every thing was new. Time seems an angel come afresh from heav'n, His pinions shedding fragrance as he flies, And his bright hour-glass running sands of gold. In every thing a smiling God is seen. On earth his beauty blooms, and in the sun His glory shines. In objects overlooked On other days he now arrests the eye. Not in the deep recesses of his works, But on their face he now appears to dwell. While silence reigns among the works of man, The works of God have leave to speak his praise With louder voice, in earth, and air, and sea. His vital Spirit, like the light, pervades All nature, breathing round the air of heaven, And spreading o'er the troubled sea of life A halcyon calm. Sight were not needed now To bring him near, for Faith performs the work, In solemn thought surrounds herself with God, With such transparent vividness, she feels Struck with admiring awe, as if transform'd To sudden vision. Such is oft her power In God's own house, which in th' absorbing act Of adoration, or inspiring praise, She with his glory fills, as once a cloud Of radiance filled the temple's inner court; At which display she cries with trembling awe How dreadful is this place! while love responds, How amiable thy courts, my King, my God! Written while Napoleon was at St. Helena. Thou too, Napoleon, how didst thou exult In all thy might and fame. Now too how changed! Thy kingdom gone, how art thou driven from men, From the great world, to spend thy days alone, To make thee know there is a God that reigns And gives the crowns of earth to whom he will. By mad ambition led, how didst thou ride With streaming colours o'er the restless waves Of human glory. Now how art thou cast Upon a cheerless rock, in deep disgrace, A spectacle and warning to the world; Thy fortunes the career, thy fate the end Of earthly greatness, in its proudest form. How art thou fallen! so low that e'en thy foes Lose half their indignation at thy crimes In pity for thy melancholy fate. Kept in thy rocky tower, thou now art viewed With safety, though with trembling, as long known The tiger that had ravaged half the world. The wand'rers of the sea who pass thine isle And mark the spot, how small, and wild, and lone, With wagging head and taunting lips inquire, Is this the man that caused the earth to quake? That burnt her cities, laid her countries waste, And shook her thrones and kingdoms to the dust? Where now the objects of thy heart's delight, Where now the pomp of armies in array, The waving banners and the dazzling arms, The trumpet's clang, the neighing of fierce steeds, The din of martial bands, the word, the shout, That rouse and fire and madden all the soul While panting for the onset, or amidst The heat of battle? Where the victory proud, The rattling of thy furious chariot wheels O'er crumbling crowns and plains of bleaching bones, The spoil of nations? the triumphal train? The acclamation of saluting crowds, And all the ensigns of renown and pow'r? Gone like the pageants of a maniac's brain. Poor solitary man, what hast thou more, What hast thou left congenial to thy mind To busy its dread workings, and content Its boundless longings? What to give support To thy faint heart in all its sinking hours? Ah, what to smooth the rough decline of life And light thee through the shadowy vale of death? Hadst though not cast away the truth of God, Denied thy Saviour, turned thy back on heaven And braved the wrath to come from early youth, In some desponding hour, when self-immured, Or in some lonely walk o'er bloodless plains Or heights from which thick ranks of coming waves Are seen afar, as if from Europe sent To bear to thee dread visions of the past, And roar and dash around thy rocky isle To wake thy conscience from its torpid sleep, The hope were strong that mem'ry thus beset Would bring thy crimes in long and black array To thy astonished view, nor rest permit Till by omnipotence an entrance wide Were opened for conviction and remorse Into each fortified recess within. How would the generous heart of every land Rejoice, should penitence yet mark the close Of thy eventful life, and mercy wash Thy spirit pure in its all cleansing fount! How welcome were the tidings that the peace Of heaven, the fruit of child-like faith and love, In thy tumultuous bosom had begun Its gentle reign. How far from hateful, nay How lovely and how truly great wert thou On bended knees at thy Redeemer's feet, Dumb with confusion or with loud lament O'er thy offences, pleading for his grace, And bowing to his will with pride subdued. That were the vict'ry of a noble mind. Thy triumphs o'er mankind have made thee known, A vict'ry o'er thyself would make thee great. The conquest of the world were mean to this, More than an earthly diadem were thine, And more than immortality in name. But if no season of relenting come With hope attendant, one will come at last Fraught with despair eternal and intense. Though thou hast peopled the dark realms of death These many years with an unfeeling heart, A scene is coming which will make thee feel. With all thy hardihood thou canst not stand Unmoved a moment, when before the bar Of stern impartial justice, millions slain By thy ambition, cut off unprepared And sent to judgment, millions more bereaved, All cry for vengeance on thy single head. Then shall past glory but increase thy shame. Then wouldst thou gladly into nothing shrink, Or be the most obscure of all the slaves That ever crouched and trembled at thy nod. Among the chief occasions which invite The patriot, philanthropist and saint To great exertions, what more loudly calls On either, than the miserable state Of Afric's sons in iron bondage held? Where held in bondage? In what savage land? Where learning and religion never shed Their meliorating beams; and where the rights, The natural rights of man were never known? In no such land, such corner of the world; But in the midst of the united realm Of learning and religion; and where, too, The natural rights of man are clearly known; Nay, more, are owned, and made a public boast. All are born free, and all with equal rights. So speaks the charter of a nation proud Of her unequall'd liberties and laws, While in that nation, shameful to relate, One man in five is born and dies a slave. Is this my country? this that happy land, The wonder and the envy of the world? O for a mantle to conceal her shame! But why, when Patriotism cannot hide The ruin which her guilt will surely bring If unrepented; and unless the God Who pour'd his plagues on Egypt till she let The oppressed go free, and often pours his wrath In earthquakes and tornadoes on the isles Of western India, laying waste their fields, Dashing their mercenary ships ashore, Tossing the isles themselves like floating wrecks, And burying towns alive in one wide grave No sooner ope'd but closed; let judgment pass For once untasted till the general doom, Can it go well with us while we retain This cursed thing? Will not untimely frosts, Devouring insects, drought, and wind and hail, Destroy the fruits of ground long till'd in chains? Will not some daring spirit born to thoughts Above his beast-like state, find out the truth That Africans are men; and catching fire From Freedom's altar raised before his eyes With incense fuming sweet, in others light A kindred flame in secret, till a train Kindled at once, deal death on every side? Cease then, Columbia, for thy safety cease, And for thine honour, to proclaim the praise Of thy fair shores of liberty and joy, While thrice five hundred thousand wretched slaves In thine own bosom, start at every word As meant to mock their woes, and shake their chains, Thinking defiance which they dare not speak. Ye sons of Liberty, who rally round Her standard at her yearly festival, Flourish the sword and bid the cannon roar Defiance to all tyrants, shout huzzas O'er flowing bowls, and with exulting voice Sing âgive us liberty or give us death;â Your joy is merciless, while its glad sounds From more than half the land return in groans; Throw down your banners lifted to the sky, They will not float on this impoisoned air. Away with feast and song, come fast and weepâ Away with all defiance and disdain Of foreign tyrants; humbly mourn our own. For who are tyrants? they that make men slaves. No more exult o'er kingdoms of the east Where not a slave is found, till here are none. Of more equality no longer boast. Rail at usurping peers, when ye have shown That fifty tenants to support a lord, Is more at war with reason and with Heaven Than fifty slaves a planter to support In personal rights and privileges dear The monarch rises not so far above The meanest free-born subject of his realm, As does the master o'er the helpless slave. With needful food supplied, the slave, say some, Desires no more, and void of care is blest. If by kind treatment it be sometimes thus, What does it prove, but that the man debased By his condition, knows no higher good Than what the brute enjoys? And is it just To shut him from all rational delight Until he feel no wants but those of sense, Then call him happy to excuse the crime? Or is it then no blessing to be free? And were they fools who struggled to obtain Our independenceâto throw off a yoke Far less oppressive than the one we bind On Afric's sable sons? Are they not tax'd? Yes! to the very blood that warms their veins. No rights have they, not one for self-defence. The master may inflict whate'er he will On this side death! may lash, and maul, and kick, All which these eyes have seen; may chain and yoke And if the sufferer but a finger lift Against the madman to preserve his life, The law condemns him, friendless and unheard. Hail land of liberty! Come all ye kings And tyrants of the world, come near and view This land of liberty, where men are free To task, and scourge, and chain their fellow men At their own pleasure, and without the fear Of any human bar. What man can plead That such ill treatment is but seldom seen, When every master, e'en the most humane, Rules with the lash, and with the lash must rule: Slaves can be governed only by the lash. No obligations bind them, and no fears Of ought but corporal punishment restrain. Much more is granted, for their sake and ours They must be kept in ignorance till freed. A taste of knowledge would a torment prove, Like joyful music to the sad in soul; Or like a view of land beyond the reach While sinking in the flood. Expand their minds And they will know their rights; will learn the worth Of freedom, and up starting from the ground Will burst their chains and raise our mad'ning cry, âOr give us liberty or give us death.â Keep them in ignorance and we are safe; Press them to earth like brutes, and they will bear Nor rise against us till the judgment day. 'Tis mockery to soothe whom we oppress. 'Tis insult to attempt to put them off By mitigating means, to make amends For loss of libertyâto make them feel, And make mankind believe, that they are blest. All short of full deliverance is in vain. 'Twill not suffice to lessen wrongs like theirs: To soften hardships so severe at best. No! chains are chains, though half concealed with flowers, No! Slavery is a tyger, even when it seems Most like a lamb. Its kindest smiles are frowns, Its tender mercies cruel as the grave. It is a monster that cannot be tamed; Hard as a rock of adamant his heart. Then will ye play with him as with a bird? Attempt to lead him with a silken string, To stroke his bristled mane and gaily pat His iron scales? Beware lest he despise Such mock caresses; lest they stir him up To put forth in a rage, his latent strength. I will not say religion can do nought To ease the heavy load of men enslaved Nor will I say, to teach them sacred truths, Truths that require submission and content, Tending to humble not elate the heart, Will be to plant the seeds of civil war. Much less would I be thought to intimate That this is not our duty, or this all. What then? Because religion is a balm For every wound, may wounds be multiplied? Because the martyr triumphed in the flames, Was it the less a crime to light the fire? Because religion made its converts yield Subjection to each ordinance of man, Even when Nero swam in christian blood, Was persecution of its horrors stripp'd? And so, because the slave when taught from Heaven, May bear the worst in peace, without complaint, Trusting in Him whose vengeance will repay, Is slavery no oppression? What if some, Finding in this strange land the precious pearl Which they had always wanted in their own, Will bless forever the once-cursed day When they were torn from all that men hold dear, Confined in irons and to bondage doom'd? Does this afford the shadow of a plea In our behalf? Or makes it ought the less Our duty to emancipate the whole? But when and how may this be safely done? Done it should be; with safety if it can, With danger if it must. It ill becomes Our name to shrink from suffering in our turn, We who have reaped the profits of their fall Selfish in all, shall we expect to make Their rise our gain? Say not they are entail'd Our sad inheritance, and we must bear What we lament, but have not power to change. Lament and bear! Is this the generous plaint Of charity perplex'd and sorely griev'd? No, 'tis the plea of avarice, who pays Her court to charity to still her fears, While safe possession is the end in view. But more than calm endurance is our crime, And more than reaping what our fathers sow'd. Their very spirit lives, their very sin In all its horrors, lives in spite of law. Each year brings thousands o'er the groaning waves To be sent in by stealth through our wide bounds: And when discovered, forfeited like goods, Like them too they are seiz'd and advertis'd And sold at auction, to complete the crime. Will not Jehovah visit for such things? Will he not be aveng'd on such a land? Go ye, whose feelings custom has not steel'd, See men to market driv'n like fatten'd herds There to be sold and parted, friend from friend, Parted by scourges, yokes or galling chains, Then judge if slavery is no more our crime, But our calamity. Go first and view Fair freedom's temple, while her chosen sons From her confederated realms are met To pay their yearly off'rings at her shrine. Enter and hear the clap of loud applause, When by some fav'rite voice, declaiming loud, To crouded aisles and galleries adorn'd With forms of beauty rang'd in brilliant rows, This matchless land is blazon'd to the stars For liberty, equality, and joy: Then go and view a drove of human souls, Immortal beings for whom Jesus died, To market driv'n, and by their fellow men Whose blackness lies far deeper than their skin. Go listen to the lashes and the shrieks That mingling rend the air, while clinging friends Husband and wife, the mother and the child, By various purchasers are torn apart And doom'd to different regions of the land, Never to see each other's faces more; Never to hear by letter or report Of other's welfare dearer than their own; Never to know their death, till after years 'Tis learnt by meeting them beyond the grave. O proud Columbia, hide thy towering head Low in the dust, in shame and penitence, Till from thy robes be wash'd the stain of blood; Then like a goddess rising from the sea, Then rising in thy glory, prove thyself âThe queen of earth, the daughter of the skies.â I see thy glory with prophetic eye, I see thee with thy crown of many stars On thy fair head, and clothed in spotless robes, Moving in state toward the Atlantic shore: With one hand casting to the waves below The last of all thy slave-oppressing chains, And with the other holding to thy breast The book of God. I hear the shouts of joy That ring from end to end of thy domain. I hear the sounds prolong'd from wave to wave And now they strike and echo on the coast Of joyful Africa. The time will comeâ Sure as the groans of earth shall all be lost In the hosannas of millennial blissâ The time will come when slavery shall cease, When this whole nation, like that favour'd part Northward and eastward stretching from the shores Of Susquehannah, shall enjoy the smiles Of freedom, equal, common, as the air. At such a prospect, who, that has a heart With one remaining spark of generous fire, Feels not an inward glowing of delight? Who that can pray, will cease to importune The Lord of all to hasten the event. From those who purchase of their own accord The blood and sinews of their fellow men, No pity is expected; but from them On whom the sad possession is entail'd Without the power to set the pris'ners free, At least from all the pious and humane, Much may be hoped in aid of every plan For hastening on the day of full release. These join'd with those whose blessing 'tis to live Among the hills and vallies of the north, âWhere all born free inherit equal rights,â Will form a host not armed, but inspir'd By reason, right, humanity and Heav'n, To undertake and to effect the work Of liberating brethren from their chains. O for some Wilberforce to lead the van! To rise and say, âIt must and shall be done;â To rise the hundredth time, unaw'd by frowns, Undamp'd by failures, and repeat the same, Till vict'ry crown him with a fairer wreath Than hero ever won or poet feign'd. The wrongs of Africa must be redress'd Extensive as her injuries, her claims For compensation are upon the world. A handful honoured with the christian name, Buried in dungeons in the savage coast Of Barbary, have summon'd from afar The fleets of mighty nations to their aid. 'Twere noble, though but just, in nations once Inhumanly employ'd in forging chains For unoffending Africa, to draw A line of ships, to build therewith a wall Around her, to defend her helpless shores From ruffian out-laws; to explore the holds Of all suspected ships, whatever flag May dance on high, to cover what's below; And from these loathsome dungeons, floating graves, To raise to life, to light and liberty, The pining, dying captives there confin'd, Bound down in irons, and to hardships doom'd That ending in the loss of half their lives, Thus rob the murderers before they reach Their destin'd port. In that tremendous day When from her vast unfathomable depth The opening sea shall yield her rising dead; Oh! what a host, in one continuous line, Marking to gazing worlds the wonted course Of this infernal traffic o'er the main, Through floods divided by the trumpet's sound, Like that divided by the sacred rod Of Israel's leader, shall ascend to fill The persecuting nations with dismay. Then let the nations tremble and reform. Let those who have begun, pursue the work Of restitution, till no slave be found. And let my country be the first to pay The full arrears of justice, still the due Of injured Africa, that at the bar Of final retribution, she may stand The first forgiven, or the last condemn'd. EXTRACTS FROM BOOK IV. The good man's body ere it can ascend To its appointed place 'mid angel forms, Must drop its load of perishable flesh, Its burden of infirmities and pains; Must throw off its corruption, and put on The incorruption of a spirit pure. Address'd for flight, it stretches its new wings And with fresh immortality inspir'd, Claps them in triumph o'er its empty grave, Then springs aloft; and like a bird uncag'd, Flies far away from all its former haunts With death and danger fearfully beset. Henceforth not one of all those maladies, So thick between the cradle and the tomb, Clinging so close through all this mortal life, Spurring it on more eagerly, the more They load it down, can e'er molest or touch The liberated body, in the realms Of perfect bliss. No violent disease Racks it with pain, its heart-strings breaks at once, And tears it from its griping hold on life. No pale consuming sickness by degrees Drinks its vitality before it kills, Leaving a breathing skeleton behind; Lays on its victim's head a gentle hand, And flatters it to death; its thoughtless guards Decoys off one by one, and unawares Mines its deep way into the vital part. Th' imperishable frame knows no fatigue From long activity, and hence no need Of rest, or sleep, to strengthen or refresh. It fears no with'ring from the frost of age, And from its winter no decrease of warmth. It feels no lassitude from length of years, No feebleness of limbs, no blunted sense, No clogging of the wheels of life, no loss Of youthful relish for the sweets of heav'n. If converse with Jehovah forty days Amid the terrors of mount Sinai, made A mortal's countenance like an angel's shine, O how eternal converse with the Lamb, Upon mount Sion, 'mid its signs of peace, While all around is calm and beautiful, Will make the face of an immortal glow. How will his lips, in his Redeemer's praise Hosannas chanting, burn with fervour pure, His very fingers, flying o'er the strings Of his melodious harp, with rosy tinge Shall grow resplendent, half transparent grow, Like those of some fair hand before a lamp, Held near to guard it from the passing air. The saint redeem'd, his glory not innate, From his Redeemer constantly received, The mere reflection of his solar blaze, May, hence, perhaps, outshine an angel, clad With native splendour; as the moon, adorn'd With lustre borrow'd from the source of day, Outshines a star with light inherent deck'd. Death is not a door That leads into some unknown abode Of long forgetfulness, but a bright gate Which opens into paradise direct. The deathless spirit, disembodied flies As swift as thought to its eternal home. Transporting change! from earth to heav'n at once, Through no long, cheerless intermediate state. To fall asleep in this benighted world And in an instant wake in realms of day. Unnumber'd suns on this deep midnight rise, And harps unnumber'd this dead silence break. One moment, rack'd with pain, the good man lies Gasping in death, the next, he mounts on high Fir'd with the raptures of immortal life. One moment, he beholds himself confin'd Within a narrow chamber, hut obscure, Or dreary dungeon, and the next, through realms Of boundless joy, expatiating wide, Without restraint. One moment he beholds Himself 'mid weeping mortals, and the next 'Mid seraphs smiling bright; one moment, hears The painful sobs of sympathizing grief, The next, the shouts of gratulating joy. With such a change before him, who would dread An early death, amid the fairest scenes And brightest prospects, that the earth presents? The comfort of his parents, and the flow'r Of all their offspring, lovely from a child, For years devout, with genius bright endow'd, With academic honours crown'd, prepar'd For sacred functions, and withal betroth'd To one well worthy of his fondest love; Was young Horatio when consumption lit, High on his sunken cheek, her hectic flush Death's sure but timely warning, in its hue Distinguished from the ruddy glow of health, As the dead leaf of autumn from the rose, Nor less by its distinctness, unobscur'd By intermixture with the whiteness round. The nightly sweat, cold, clammy and profuse, Left him each morning, scarce an infant's strength. But while his tender frame was wasting fast, Its vigour unimpair'd his mind retain'd, Nay gather'd force as oft in that disease Which weigh'd him down; incurable, but kind To suffering excellence. That sacred fire Seem'd fed with the vitality consum'd, And brighter shone through its decaying shrine. Fresher and fairer grew th' ingrafted germ Of immortality, the more its stock Was gently stript of its degenerate bloom. He saw his end at hand, and was the first To give up ev'ry hope of longer life. His friends began to flatter, to assume A cheerful tone and wear a smiling look, In his endearing presence, all but one Who could not smile, so heavy was her heart; And when she tried to speak some cheering words, Her feeble, trembling voice and starting tears Betray'd the anguish of despairing love. But all the kind attempts of friendship fail'd To hide his danger from himself, or raise The expectation of returning health; And soon he check'd them with far dearer hopes. Calmly he turn'd his eyes away from earth And fix'd them stedfastly on Christ and heav'n, Till the one thought of his approaching change Absorb'd his soul and fill'd it with delight Unfelt before. Dismiss'd without a sigh Were earthly plans and prospects; in their stead Shone so invitingly and now so near Celestial glories. Ardent love to Christ And the near view of heav'n inspired his heart With such a longing to be on the wing, That e'en to her, from whom his earthly schemes For happiness deriv'd their brightest charm, He spoke of his departure in a strain Of mingled joy and tenderness, that calm'd Her troubled mind. The evening ere his last, While yet the window curtain drawn aside At his request, show'd him the setting sun, And all were speechless with prophetic grief To see him gaze on that departing orb By love embolden'd on his bed-side sate This mourner dear, his cold and slender hand, Of bloodless white, between her warm soft palms Tenderly holding, on his alter'd face Gazing intently with an eloquent look Of fond solicitude, when as he turn'd His eyes on her, and feebly press'd her hand, Her struggling bosom and her gushing tears Rous'd all his sympathy; yet even then, Soon as that momentary shock was past He rais'd his thoughts and hers to fairer skies Than these below, whose sun shall not go down, And where these days of mourning have an end. His few remaining hours were spent in prayer For his own soul and for each friend apart; Save when employ'd in heav'nly converse sweet. Soon as he felt the chilling touch of death, For ev'ry absent member he inquir'd Till the whole mournful family stood round, When silence for one thrilling moment reign'd; First broken by a universal burst Of sorrow, witness'd with a pitying eye But with unshaken firmness, till he heard The sympathetic cry of one too young To know her loss, but not too young to love, His little sister in her father's arms, Lifted that she might see him and be seen. Her mournful cry, and half-averted look, Went to his heart, but soon compos'd again He tried to soothe her with the kindest words; Then with his eyes suffus'd with glist'ning tears, His parents thank'd for their unwearied care, And bade them look for comfort from above, To each one present gave that kind advice Which suited each, repeated, and enforc'd As the last counsel of a dying friend, Just leaving all things here for things unseen, The world of spirits and the God of heav'n. These duties done, awhile he lay absorb'd In deep devotion. On their elbows propp'd His wither'd arms were raised, and o'er his breast His fingers interlock'd. His eyes were closed As when in pleasant sleep; his lips at times Mov'd gently, but no whisper could be heard. A fixed serenity not quite a smile, More sober, but as beautiful and sweet, O'erspread his countenance, until the pains Of dissolution, pains yet unreveal'd, Began to loose and break the tender strings That bind the spirit to its partner frail In mystic union; when, at ev'ry pang A sudden brightness o'er his features came, As ev'ry pang the dying dolphin feels Sends a fresh lustre to its beauteous sides. Conven'd to witness his triumphant death Some friendly neighbours, strains of his own choice Were softly singing, when with lifted eyes, And aspect luminous as with the light Of heaven's opening gate, he strove to join His voice with theirs, and breathe out all he felt; But in the effort feeble nature sunk Exhausted; and while ev'ry voice was hush'd His fluttering spirit, struggling to get free Rose like the sky-lark singing up to heav'n, Follow'd in thought by friends devoutly still, And there at once, united with the blest In chanting hallelujahs to the Lamb. THE RELIGION OF TASTE. Ye Quietists in homage to the skies.â Night Thoughts. I. Deep in a vale, half open to the sea, With mountains half enclosed, there grew a wood Of many a low and many a lofty tree, Sheltering the sparrow's and the raven's brood; But not in its own native dress it stood, Untrimmed and pathless, for within its heart Dwelt an Enchantress of romantic mood, And she had wrought of all with wondrous art A labyrinth, from which, none entering could depart. II. Her name Imagination,âtall her form; Elastic with eternal youth her tread; Her high and polished brow defied each storm Of grief and time; o'er all her face was spread A shade of happy thought that never fled, But lighter grew or deeper, as she raised Her large bright eyes and nature's volume read, Or fixed them on the ground, or upward gazed As in devotion wrapt while glory round her blazed. III. A band of Nymphs and Graces with her dwelt, Lived in her smiles, upon her accents hung, And by her impulse moved and thought and felt; Love, Beauty, Pleasure, Hope, were first among The blooming troop, and nearest to her clung, Reflecting every charm till made their own, And till they bore her likeness, as if sprung From her, their foster-mother, on her thrown Till she had won each heart, and proud of each had grown. IV. I thought to paint them, but enamoured stopt:â Some muse, a pencil of soft sunbeams dip In heaven's pure dew on rose and lily dropt, To draw the brow, the cheek, the smiling lip, Tinged, as of cup enchanted, wont to sip, The eye in liquid light, the long bright hair, And all the slender, rounded forms that trip O'er the green earth half buoyant in the air, And with sweet glances thrown, unwary hearts to snare. V. I see them passing in the blended light Of their own forms, as in an atmosphere Of rosy lustre;âbut they mock my sight; Now as they flit along in order clear Each seems herself, and now they all appear Lost in each other, like some sister band, Giving and taking loveliness, as here And there, they dance and mingle hand in hand; Now in a sunny mist they vanish where they stand. VI. And let them go;âtwo others rise to view, That may far better wake my deep-toned lyre,â Calm Contemplation with clear eye of blue And bright Enthusiasm with dark orbs of fire,â Each with a form and spirit that aspire To seeming rivalry with their loved queen,â One wrapt in thought, and one in high desire, One bold, one gentle, both of lofty mien,â A burning seraph one, a cherub one serene. VII. With the soft lustre of thick flaxen hair And cheek of snowy white, that milder one Seemed of some land of tempered beams and air;â The other's cheek was tinged as by the sun Of sultry climes; but no eye sought to shun That pure transparent olive, while beneath The bright vermil blood is seen to glow and run, And tresses of the deepest chesnut wreath Her round and polished neck as light the zephyrs breathe. VIII. Wandering together oft, and oft alone, They mused o'er all the fair, the wild, and vast, And drank in pleasure, when all nature shone In sunny bloom and calm, and when o'ercast With solemn shade, or swept by stormy blast:â Deep and delicious was their waking dream. Through placid smiles, or warm tears falling fast How from each feature did their spirits seem To breathe in silence sweet, or in quick rapture beam. IX. 'Twas by her own soft magic, or the charms Imparted to some favourite of her train, Their Queen would hush her captive's first alarms, Then lead him on as by a silken chain, Through all the windings of her fair domain, To fountain, lake, and grotto, grove and bower, 'Mid murmuring brooks, or birds of tuneful strain, O'er grassy paths inlaid with many a flower, And at each bright and glad, or calm and fragrant hour. X. Oft with a motion of her wand, she wrought Some work of fresh enchantment; to his view A long-forgotten scene of beauty brought, Made every feature clearer, every hue, And over all a lovelier aspect threw; Or full before him visions of each clime, She spread as quickly, formed creations new Or changed her own loved wood, with art sublime Hastened, or backward turned, or stopt the wheels of time. XI. Just in the centre of that wood was reared Her castle, all of marble, smooth and white; Above the thick young trees, its top appeared Among the naked trunks of towering height; And here at morn and eve it glittered bright, As often by the far off traveller seen, In level sunbeams, or at dead of night When the low moon shot in her rays between That wide spread roof and floor of solid foliage green. XII. Through this wide interval the roving eye From turrets proud might trace the waving line Where meet the mountains green, and azure sky, And view the deep when sun-gilt billows shine;â Fair bounds to sight, that never thought confine, But tempt it far beyond, till by the charm Of some sweet wood-note or some whispering pine Called home again, or by the soft alarm Of Love's approaching step, and her encircling arm. XIII. Through this wide interval, the mountain side Showed many a sylvan slope and rocky steep:â Here roaring torrents in dark forests hide; There silver streamlets rush to view and leap Unheard from lofty cliffs to vallies deep: Here rugged peaks look smooth in sunset glow, Along the clear horizon's western sweep; There from some eastern summit moon-beams flow Along o'er level wood, far down to plains below. XIV. Now stretched a blue, and now a golden zone Round that horizon; now o'er mountains proud Dim vapours rest, or bright ones move alone: An ebon wall, a smooth portentous cloud, First muttering low, anon with thunder loud, Now rises quick and brings a sweeping wind O'er all that wood in waves before it bowed; And now a rainbow, with its top behind A spangled veil of leaves, seems heaven and earth to bind. XV. Above the canopy, so thick and green, And spread so high o'er that enchanted vale, Through scattered openings oft were glimpses seen Of fleecy clouds, that linked together, sail In moonlight clear before the gentle gale Sometimes a shooting meteor draws a glance; Sometimes a twinkling star, or planet pale, Long holds the lighted eye as in a trance; And oft the milky-way gleams through the white expanse. XVI. That castle's open windows, though half hid With flowering vines, showed many a vision fair: A face all bloom, or light young forms that thrid Some maze within, or lonely ones that wear The garb of joy with sorrow's thoughtful air, Oft caught the eye a moment; and the sound Of low, sweet music often issued there, And by its magic held the listener bound, And seemed to hold the winds and forests far around. XVII. Within, the Queen of all, in pomp or mirth, While glad attendants at her glance unfold Their shining wings and fly through heaven and earth, Oft took her throne of burning gems and gold, Adorned with emblems that of empire told, And rising in the midst of trophies bright, That bring her memory from the days of old, And help prolong her reign, and with the flight Of every year increase the wonders of her might. XVIII. In all her dwelling, tales of wild romance, Of terror, love, and mystery dark or gay, Were scattered thick to catch the wandering glance, And stop the dreamer on his unknown way; There too was every sweet and lofty lay, The sacred, classic, and romantic, sung As that Enchantress moved in might or play; And there was many a harp but nowly strung, Yet with its fearless notes the whole wide valley rung. XIX. There from all lands and ages of her fame, Were marble forms, arrayed in order due, In groups and single, all of proudest name; In them the high, the fair, and tender, grew To life intense in love's impassioned view, And from each air and feature, bend and swell, Each shapely neck, and lip, and forehead, threw O'er each enamoured sense so deep a spell, The thoughts but with the past or bright ideal dwell. XX. The walls around told all the pencil's power; There proud creations of each mighty hand Shone with their hues and lines as in the hour, When the last touch was given at the command Of the same genius that at first had planned, Exulting in its great and glowing thought: Bright scenes of peace and war, of sea and land, Of love and glory, to new life were wrought, From history, from fable, and from nature brought. XXI. With these were others all divine, drawn all From ground where oft, with signs and accents dread, The lonely prophet doomed to sudden fall Proud kings and cities, and with gentle tread Bore life's quick triumph to the humble dead, And where strong angels flew to blast or save, Where martyred hosts of old, and youthful bled, And where their mighty Lord o'er land and wave Spread life and peace till death, then spread them through the grave. XXII. From these fixed visions of the hallowed eye, Some kindling gleams of their etherial glow, Would oft times fall, as from the opening sky, On eyes delighted, glancing to and fro, Or fastened till their orbs dilated grow; Then would the proudest seem with joy to learn Truths they had feared or felt ashamed to know; The skeptic would believe, the lost return; And all the cold and low would seem to rise and burn. XXIII. Theirs was devotion kindled by the vast, The beautiful, impassioned, and refined; And in the deep enchantment o'er them cast, They looked from earth, and soared above their kind To the blest calm of an abstracted mind; And its communion with things all its own, Its forms sublime and lovely; as the blind, Mid earthly scenes, forgotten, or unknown, Live in ideal worlds, and wander there alone. XXIV. Such were the lone enthusiasts, wont to dwell With all whom that Enchantress held subdued, As in the holiest circle of her spell, Where meaner spirits never dare intrude, They dwelt in calm and silent solitude, Rapt in the love of all the high and sweet, In thought, and art, and nature, and imbued With its devotion to life's inmost seat, As drawn from all the charms which in that valley meet. XXV. Of them and their religion, though by creed Or grave observance known not, Heaven inspire My wayward heart to sing as Truth shall lead, And Love, my lips shall hallow with her fire, And to her harmony shall tune my lyre:â Wide as the realm of taste I find my theme, And rich as nature's charms that never tire; 'Tis bright or dark as fancy's changing dream, Yet pure as truth and love in their united stream. XXVI. 'Tis not for me, in weak revenge to war With beauty's reign, or e'en to wish it less; 'Tis not for me, ungratefully to mar Delight, so ready and so rich to bless That but to lift the eye is to possess; Nor would I, with a soul that ill could brook To lose the sense of nature's loveliness For one short day, bid others cease to look O'er all the works of God, content with his one book. XXVII. To love the beautiful is not to hate The holy, nor to wander from the true; Else why in Eden did its Lord create Each green and shapely tree to please the view? Why not enough that there the fruitful grew? But wherefore think it virtue pure and blest To feast the eye with shape and bloom and hue? Or wherefore think it holier than the zest With which the purple grape by panting lips is prest. XXVIII. The rose delights with colour and with form, Nor less with fragrance; but to love the flower For either, or for all, is not to warm The bosom with the thought of that high Power, Who gathered all into its blooming hour: As well might love of gold be love to Him, Who on the mountain poured its pristine shower, And buried it in currents deep and dim, Or spread it in bright drops along the river's brim. XXIX. Yet Taste and Virtue are not born to strife; 'Tis when the earthly would the heavenly scorn, Nor merely spread with flowers, her path to life, But would supplant when bound to cheer and warn, Or at the touch of every wounding thorn Would tempt her from that path, or bid her trust No truth too high for fancy to adorn, And turn from all too humble with disgust; 'Tis then she wakes a war, when in her pride unjust. XXX. But oft in Taste when mindful of her birth, Celestial Virtue owns a mortal friend, A fit interpreter of scenes of earth, And one delighting thought with hers to blend Amid their loveliness, and prompt to lend The light and charm of her own smile to all;â Thus when to heaven our best affections tend, Taste helps the spirit upward at the call Of Faith and echoing Hope, or scorns to work its fall. XXXI. The path we love,âto that all things allure; We give them power malignant or benign; Yes, to the pure in heart all things are pure; And to the bright in fancy, all things shine; All frown on those that in deep sorrow pine, Smile on the cheerful, lead the wise abroad O'er Nature's realm in search of laws divine; All draw the earthly down to their vile clod; And all unite to lift the heavenly to their God. XXXII. The universe is calm to faith serene; And all with glory shines to her bright eye; The mount of Sion, crowned with living green By all the beams and dews of its pure sky, She sees o'er clouds and tempests rising high From its one fountain pouring streams that bear Fresh life and beauty, ne'er to fade and die, But make the blasted earth an aspect wear, Like that of its blest prime, divinely rich and fair. XXXIII. The eye which she has opened, rolls in light O'er a creation, in which God is viewed, In all that blooms by day and shines by night, Without him all a cheerless solitude; The heart that with her spirit is imbued, At nature's mingled works of power and love Trembles with awe and swells with gratitude, And pants for the swift pinions of a dove, To waft the soul away to Him who reigns above. XXXIV. But while upon her high and holy ground Faith stands and makes the universe her own, Her votaries with its splendour to surround, To add to her pure light, and hers alone, And help to raise them to her promised throne, Slaves of fine sense there are, that think to climb, E'en by a path on which she never shone Up nature's lone steps to a height sublime Of triumph o'er the gloom of sin and death and time. XXXV. The Piety of faith from nature draws Her chief delight where most of love appears, Love in the round of its eternal laws, In the wide flow of light from rolling spheres, In genial showers, mild climes, and fruitful years, In sights of happy life and songs of praise, In all the care that wins the heart and cheers And all the bounty, like the sun's full blaze Pouring its tide of blessings o'er revolving days. XXXVI. The Piety of taste her pleasure finds, Where power in bright pre-eminence is seen, By tender spirits and exalted minds, In all the grand and fair, wild and serene, In heaven's clear blue and earth's contrasted green, In mountain-tops and clouds around them driven, In boundless seas, high stars, and night's pale queen, In all the hues and notes of morn and even, In all the charms of earth and all the pomp of heaven. XXXVII. Who boasts the power of piety, so weak In all its loveliness, whene'er he deigns The book of God to open, turns to seek Its melting histories and lofty strains, Or learn what flowers once filled Judea's plains, What gems her mountains, and what beasts her wood, What cities flourished once where silence reigns, What deeds were wrought where monuments have stood, How earth from chaos rose, how rolled beneath her flood. XXXVIII. As o'er this field of poetry he strays, He culls what truths are lovely and sublime,â Existence with no first or last of days, And goodness with no bound of space or time, Souls from the earth kept ever in their prime, Angels attending men to virtue dear, A heaven where both towards their Maker climb, A day when all the dead his voice shall hear And o'er a world made new, songs burst on every ear. XXXIX. Thus on the fair in nature, and the vast, And on the truths revealed that charm the eye Of Fancy bright, and open through the past And future, many a range of vision high, And wide and glorious as the starry sky, He builds a proud religion ill refined, And from it hopes of immortality Draws for himself and all of kindred mind, The amiable and great and brilliant of mankind. XL. To these when gone he gives high seats among The robed in white, with joys on earth untold,â To all the beautiful among the young, And all the venerable amid the old, To bards, philosophers, and patriots bold,â Sweet rest he gives them in ambrosial bowers, With crowns of amaranth and harps of gold, While on their graves descend the gentlest showers, And brightest moonbeams sleep and bloom the earliest flowers. XLI. Such in the pride of all its glittering dross, To truth's revealed eternity so blind, Is that religion which o'erlooks the cross, While in a rose-bud it affects to find, Or in a mountain, much to fill the mind With thoughts of God, and fire the heart with love; And yet e'en this, by genius oft enshrined In numbers sweet, with these alone can move, Or seem to move the heart, or lift the thoughts above. XLII. Who learns to hold communion with the God Of this material frame, by gazing o'er Its beauty near and vastness far abroad, While yet he never bowed the knee before The reigning God of love? What sees he more To fill with joy or awe than he might see, Had earth and heaven no Maker to adore, Had they been always, or begun to be Without creating power, mid shouts of melody. XLIII. Grows he devout from all the spring's sweet bloom, Or all the pride of summer rich and gay? From autumn's fading hues and placid gloom, Or pomp of winter in its white array, With sunbeams twinkling from each icy spray, And meteors shooting thick and howling storms? Or from the lights and shades of night and day, In cloudless climes, with all the perfect forms Of grandeur that exalts, and loveliness that warms? XLIV. Then wherefore are not they who dwell apart From the great world, upon some lofty plain Amid the Andes, nearest heaven in heart? Why are not they whose home is on the main, The least unmindful of Jehovah's reign, In calm and storm, on every sea and shore? Or why do men of creed and life profane Return not after earth is travelled o'er And half its mountains climbed, less impious than before? XLV. Where are the virtues and the calm delights Of the lone cottage 'mid embowering trees, Far from the worlds tumultuous sounds and sights, On some hill-side o'erlooking smooth blue seas, Or in some vale where but the hum of bees, The chant of birds, and the rill's murmur break The charmed air's stillness, and the roughest breeze Can stir no more than into life just shake The green grove's perfect image in the glassy lake? XLVI. Draw near ye sons of romance and behold Your boasted calm of happy virtue gone; See foul intemperance and profaneness bold, And pride in rags as rank as if in lawn; See all enchantment from the scene withdrawn By the first touch of truth's celestial ray; As golden dreams all vanish at the dawn, So quick your bright creation fades away, And your etherial beings sink to things of clay. XLVII. Leave bards behind and seek the hermit's cell, High converse holds he, in his solitude With angels shedding round as by a spell A radiance into which no clouds intrude From earth, or earthly passions unsubdued? Or musing on bright skies and mountains wild Communes he with their Maker, till imbued With pure and lofty thoughts and feelings mild, By error duped no more, no more by sin defiled. XLVIII. But love of nature feasted high and long Without controlling faith, while it inspires No heavenly flame, oft feeds amid a throng Of fancies soft and wild, far other fires,â False feeling, airy hopes, and foul desires, And helps to form an idler unconfined, Or visionary, whom the truth soon tires, Or profligate, or hater of mankind, Or all in one, and more, a skeptic cold and blind. XLIX. All these was Byron, and was doubly these From his unhallowed genius revelling free Amid the charms of loveliest lands and seas:â 'Twas here he nursed the daring liberty Of dreaming what man is, and is to be, In spite of all the unimpassioned prose Of truth divine, when with sweet poetry All nature lives, luxuriates and glows, Tempting to pleasure here, leaving to fate its close. L. How did he send to Heaven defiance proud, While bounding lightly o'er the billowy world, Or gazing round him when the midnight cloud Its massy folds o'er Alpine heights unfurled, And round from cliff to cliff its light'nings hurled, With dark red gleams now showing wood and lake, Swept in broad waves, or in deep eddies whirled, Now leaving all a blank, while thunders break In one redoubling peal and all the mountains shake. LI. And when with all the elements at peace He breathed the air of Italy's soft vales, Or of the verdant shores and isles of Greece, To him the deities of classic tales Seemed to return to groves and hills and dales, Their former haunts, made theirs from beauty bright As on Arabian plains, by poisonous gales And burning suns laid waste, the skies of night With deities are filled for their cool placid light. LII. To him the Cyprian queen resumed her throne Where once the pencil, pen, and chisel vied, By borrowing nature's charms to raise her own;â On roses she must feed and sleep, must glide A form of light o'er the cerulean tide, Or towards her temple through green shady groves With garlands crowned, in pomp serene must guide Her ivory chariot drawn by swans and doves, With Graces dancing round and all her winged Loves. LIII. Tis oft the unhallowed fancy that delights O'er the sublime and fair of earth to glance, To wander long where earth with heaven unites, To sail on smooth wings o'er the blue expanse, Or on bright clouds in a voluptuous trance, Or soar 'mid worlds, above, below, around, Approaching and retreating in a dance Of light and harmony, and with that sound Of fabled music sweet, filling the vast profound. LIV. From flights so high, how quick can man descend,â From realms so bright and calm,âand roll in dust, A slave to passions that like vultures rend Ere they devour, and from the bosom thrust All feelings kind and pure, and wake mistrust Of every friend, and enmity to all The good and happy, from the cold disgust Of senses pampered till their pleasures pall; When at the world he murmurs, to revenge his fall. LV. Sick of the world, a glad farewell he sings To all its living scenes; and, worse than vain, Sighs without meaning for the dove's light wings, To waft him to some island of the main, Or far-off desert, where he may complain To woods and waters, fortune may defy, And there restored to nature's boasted reign, Feel free to pour contempt on every tie, That man to man unites, and to the God on high. LVI. Or weary of his life, he madly throws The burden down, or drags it on in dread Of each day's added weight, while no repose He looks for here, but longs to lay his head Among the silent and forgotten dead;â And this is greatness that the young betimes Learn to admire; and though his joys are fled, Still in the fancies from which sprung his crimes They think to find their joys, as if in fairy climes. LVII. They seek a paradise that from them flies And leaves them oft bewildered, like the band Of Indian youths, who searched with eager eyes Through Florida's vast swamp for unknown land, By hunters praised as rising with firm strand Just in their utmost need, and in full view, Where waving many an inviting hand, The daughters of the sun to safety drew, And cheered them with rich fruits, their labours to renew. LVIII. But when with those immortal ones they thought To live and share in their unfading prime, They saw them flee; and when they fondly sought To follow to their chosen isle, and climb Its verdant shores and cloudless heights sublime, The waters round them rose with threatening roar, The isle receding vanished many a time, Then re-appeared but distant as before, As if to bid them go content and seek no more. LIX. And thus do nature's scenes of beauty give The spirit rest, when but an hour enjoyed; Life's fainting traveller thus they oft revive, They calm the soul by earthly cares annoyed, Refine the sense by earthly pleasures cloyed, The sad heart cheer, and ease the toiling mind; But sought life's ills and labours to avoid, They mock with visions of delight that blind The eyes to truth, then fly, and leave despair behind. LX. And in the tender gloom of that despair All vigour dies, all virtue high and bold, The will to labour and the strength to bear; And man becomes a thing of passive mould, As helpless as the Sybarite of old, Who on his bed of roses could not rest, If out a leaf retained a single fold; Listless inquietude pervades his breast, And trifles from without, each moment's peace molest. LXI. All at the mercy of surrounding things, A passing cloud or bird of thrilling strain, Bears him away through wild imaginings, Like and unlike, combined in one long train; Or all resigned to fancy's gloomy reign, He melts in reveries, begun from nought, Prolonged at random and then closed in vain, A mere delirium of soft feeling wrought, With but the semblance left, of deep, continuous thought. LXII. But his is sickly feeling ill refined, Nursed in the luxury of causeless tears,â Tears that foment a fever in the mind, Yet chill and harden all within that cheers This mournful life, and man to man endears; Like Niobe he weeps himself to stone; Nought now of others woes he sees or hears, With his lost hopes his sympathies are flown, And in a social world, he lives and dies alone. LXIII. Or if his feeling e'er the heart dilate With touch of pity till a tear be shed, 'Tis more for trifles than for things of weight, Resembling much the superstitious dread The Hindoo feels, lest his incautious tread Should crush an insect, while he views unmoved The living mortal burning with the dead, A sacrifice by favourite gods approved, And by his listless spirit borne till it is loved. LXIV. Rosseau could weep,âyes, with a heart of stone The impious sophist could recline beside The pure and peaceful lake, and muse alone On all its loveliness at even tide,â On its small running waves in purple died Beneath bright clouds or all the glowing sky, On the white sails that o'er its bosom glide, And on surrounding mountains wild and high Till tears unbidden gushed from his enchanted eye. LXV. But his were not the tears of feeling fine Of grief or love; at fancy's flash they flowed, Like burning drops from some proud lonely pine By lightning fired; his heart with passion glowed Till it consumed his life, and yet he showed A chilling coldness both to friend and foe, As Etna, with its centre an abode Of wasting fire, chills with the icy snow Of all its desert brow the living world below. LXVI. Was he but justly wretched from his crimes? Then why was Cowper's anguish oft as keen, With all the heaven-born virtue that sublimes Genius and feeling, and to things unseen Lifts the pure heart through clouds, that roll between The earth and skies, to darken human hope? Or wherefore did those clouds thus intervene To render vain faith's lifted telescope, And leave him in thick gloom his weary way to grope? LXVII. He too could give himself to musing deep, By the calm lake at evening he could stand, Lonely and sad, to see the moon light sleep On all its breast by not an insect fanned, And hear low voices on the far-off strand, Or through the still and dewy atmosphere The pipe's soft tones waked by some gentle hand, From fronting shore and woody island near In echoes quick returned more mellow and more clear. LXVIII. And he could cherish wild and mournful dreams, In the pine grove, when low the full moon fair Shot under lofty tops her level beams, Stretching the shades of trunks erect and bare, In stripes drawn parallel with order rare, As of some temple vast or colonnade, While on green turf made smooth without his care He wandered o'er its stripes of light and shade, And heard the dying day-breeze all the boughs pervade. LXIX. 'Twas thus in nature's bloom and solitude He nursed his grief till nothing could assuage; 'Twas thus his tender spirit was subdued, Till in life's toils it could no more engage; And his had been a useless pilgrimage, Had he been gifted with no sacred power, To send his thoughts to every future age;â But he is gone where grief will not devour, Where beauty will not fade, and skies will never lower. LXX. To that bright world where things of earth appear Stript of false charms, my fancy often flies, To ask him there what life is happiest here; And as he points around him and replies With glowing lips, my heart within me dies, And conscience whispers of a dreadful bar, When in some scene where every beauty lies, A soft sweet pensiveness begins to mar The joys of social life, and with its claims to war. LXXI. 'Twas one of summer's last and loveliest days, When at the dawn, with a congenial friend I rose to climb the mount, that with the gaze Of expectation high we long had kenned, While travelling towards it as our journey's end:â Height after height we reached that seemed the last But far above, where we must yet ascend, Another and another rose, till fast The sun began to sink ere all but one were past. LXXII. Upon that loftiest one awhile we stood Silent with wonder and absorbing awe; A thousand peaks, the lowest crowned with wood, The highest of bare rock at once we saw, In ranges spread till seeming to withdraw Far into heaven, and mix their softer blue; While ranges near, as if in spite of law, With all wild shapes and grand filled up the view And o'er the deep dark gulf fantastic shadows threw. LXXIII. Here billows heaved in one vast swell, and there In one long sweep, as on a stormy sea, Drawn to a curling edge, seemed held in air, Ready to move as from a charm set free, And roar, and dash, and sink, and cease to be; While firm and smooth as hewn of emerald rock, Below them rose to points of one proud tree Green pyramids of pine, that seemed to mock In conscious safety proud, their vainly threatened shock. LXXIV. Here while the sun yet shone, abysses vast Like openings into inner regions seemed All objects fading, mingling, sinking fast, Save few that shot up where the sun yet beamed; But soon as his last rays around us streamed Thick darkness wrapt the whole, o'er which the glow Of western skies in feeble flashes gleamed, While bright from pole to pole extending slow Along the wide horizon ere it sunk below. LXXV. 'Twas midnight, when from our sequestered bower I stole with sleepless eyes to gaze alone; For tis alone we feel in its full power, The enchantment o'er a scene so awful thrown:â Through broken flying clouds the moon now shone, And light and shade crossed mountain-top and vale; While with imparted motion, not their own, The heavens and earth to fancy seemed to sail Through boundless space like her creation bright but frail. LXXVI. Ere long the clouds were gone, the moon was set; When deeply blue without a shade of gray, The sky was filled with stars that almost met, Their points prolonged and sharpened to one ray; Through their transparent air the milky-way Seemed one broad flame of pure resplendent white, As if some globe on fire, turned far astray, Had crossed the wide arch with so swift a flight, That for a moment shone its whole long track of light. LXXVII. At length in northern skies, at first but small, A sheet of light meteorrous begun To spread on either hand, and rise and fall In waves, that slowly first, then quickly run Along its edge, set thick but one by one With spiry beams, that all at once shot high, Like those through vapours from the setting sun; Then sidelong as before the wind they fly, Like streaking rain from clouds that flit along the sky. LXXVIII. Now all the mountain-tops and gulfs between Seemed one dark plain; from forests, caves profound And rushing waters far below unseen, Rose a deep roar in one united sound, Alike pervading all the air around, And seeming e'en the azure dome to fill, And from it through soft ether to resound In low vibrations, sending a sweet thrill To every finger's end from rapture deep and still. LXXIX. Spent with emotion, and to rest resigned, A sudden sleep fell on me, and subdued With visions bright and dread my restless mind;â Methought that in a realm of solitude, All indistinctly like the one just viewed, With guilt oppressed and with foreboding gloom, My lonely way bewildered I pursued, Mid signs of terror that the day of doom, And lovely nature's last dissolving hour had come. LXXX. The sun and moon in depths of ether sunk Till half extinct, shed their opposing light In dismal union, at which all things shrunk;â Anon they both, like meteors streaming bright, Ran down the sky and vanishedâall was night; With that a groan as from earth's centre rose, While o'er its surface ran, o'er vale and height, A waving as of woods when wild wind blows, A heaving as of life in its expiring throes. LXXXI. Far in the broad horizon dimly shone A flood of fire, advancing with a roar, Like that of ocean when the waves are thrown In nightly storms high on a rocky shore;â Spreading each way it came, and sweeping o'er Woodlands like stubble, forests wide and tall In thick ranks falling, blooming groves before Its fury vanishing too soon to fall, And mountains melting downâone deluge covering all. LXXXII. Before it, striking quick from cloud to cloud, Streamed its unearthly light along the sky, Flashing from all the swift wings of a crowd Of frighted birds at random soaring high, And from the faces of lost men that fly In throngs beneath, as back they snatched a look Of horror at the billows rolling nigh With thundering sound at which all nature shook, And e'en the strength of hope their sinking hearts forsook. LXXXIII. No more I saw, for while I thought to flee What seemed the swoon of terror held me fast, My senses drowned, and set my fancy free, Waked not, but back to sleep unconscious cast My troubled spirit; one dark moment passed, And, all revived again, my dream went on; But in that interval what changes vast! The earth and its lost multitudes were gone; A new creation blessed eternity's bright dawn. LXXXIV. Myself I found borne to a heavenly clime I knew not how, but felt a stranger there; Still the same being that I was in time, E'en to my raiment; on the borders fair Of that blest land I stood in lone despair; Not its pure beauty and immortal bloom, Its firmament serene and balmy air, Nor all its glorious beings, broke the gloom Of my foreboding thoughts, fixed on some dreadful doom. LXXXV. There walked the ransomed ones of earth in white As beautifully pure as new-fallen snow, On the smooth summit of some eastern height, In the first rays of morn that o'er it flow, Nor less resplendent than the richest glow Of snow-white clouds, with all their stores of rain And thunder spent, rolled up in volumes slow O'er the blue sky just cleared from every stain, Till all the blaze of noon they drink and long retain. LXXXVI. Safe landed on these shores, together hence That bright throng took their way to where insphered In a transparent cloud of light intense, With starry pinnacles above it reared, A city vast the inland all appeared, With walls of azure, green, and purple stone, All to one glassy surface smoothed and cleared, Reflecting forms of angel guards that shone Above the approaching host as each were on a throne. LXXXVII. And while that host moved onward o'er a plain Of living verdure, oft they turned to greet Friends that on earth had taught them heaven to gain; Then hand in hand they went with quickened feet; And bright with immortality, and sweet With love etherial, were the smiles they cast; I only wandered on with none to meet And call me dear, while pointing to the past And forward to the joys that never reach their last. LXXXVIII. I had not bound myself by any ties To that blest land; none saw me and none sought; Nor any shunned, or from me turned their eyes; And yet such sense of guilt had conscience wrought, It seemed that every bosom's inmost thought Was fixed on me; when back as from their view I shrunk, and would have fled or shrunk to nought As some I loved and many that I knew Passed on unmindful why or whither I withdrew. LXXXIX. Whereat of sad remembrances a flood Rushed o'er my spirit, and my heart beat low As with the heavy gush of curdling blood:â Soon left behind, awhile I followed slow, Then stopped and round me looked my fate to know, But looked in vain;âno voice my doom to tell;â No arm to hurl me down to depths of wo;â It seemed that I was brought to heaven to dwell That conscience might alone do all the work of hell. XC. Now came the thought, the bitter thought of years Wasted in musings sad and fancies wild, And in the visionary hopes and fears Of the false feeling of a heart beguiled By nature's strange enchantment, strong and wild; Now with celestial beauty blooming round, I stood as on some naked waste exiled; From gathering hosts came music's swelling sound But deeper in despair my sinking spirit drowned. XCI. At length methought a darkness as of death Came slowly o'er me, and with that I woke; Yet knew not in the first suspended breath Where I could be, so real seemed the stroke That in my dream all earthly ties had broke; A moment more, and melting in a tide Of grateful fervour, how did I invoke Power from the Highest to leave all beside, And live but to secure the bliss my dream denied. XCII. The day soon dawned, and I could not but view Its purple tinge in heaven, and then its beams Revealing all around me, as they flew From peak to peak, and striking in soft gleams On the white mists that hung o'er winding streams Through trackless forests, and o'er clustering lakes In vallies wide, where many a green height seems An isle above the cloud that round it breaks, As with the breeze it moves and its deep bed forsakes. XCIII. Yet all was viewed with calm and thoughtful joy, As but reminding me that earth was still My bright abode of hope, to high employ Inviting me through all its good and ill, Its smiles to flatter and its frowns to chill:â The one dread thought of an hereafter reigned Within me, followed me, nor ceased to fill My heart and soul through days of peace unfeigned,â Would Heaven that till this hour its freshness had remained. XCIV. With thoughts sublimed and yet chastised by truth, 'Tis sweet to see from our maturer years How vain the fond imaginings of youth,â 'Tis sweet to see, while faith the bosom cheers, The withering of the flowers that fancy rears, The fading of her visions once so bright, And when her bubbles burst, to smile in tears That we could trust so much in things so light, So sure to lead astray and then to take their flight. XCV. A bright or dark eternity in view, With all its fixed unutterable things, What madness in the living to pursue, As their chief portion, with the speed of wings The joys that death-beds always turn to stings! Infatuated man, on earth's smooth waste To dance along the path that always brings Quick to an end, from which with tenfold haste Back would he gladly fly till all should be retraced! XCVI. Our life is like the hurrying on the eve Before we start on some long journey bound, When fit preparing to the last we leave, Then run to every room the dwelling round, And sigh that nothing needed can be found; Yet go we must, and soon as day shall break; We snatch an hour's repose, when loud the sound For our departure calls; we rise and take A quick and sad farewell, and go ere well awake. XCVII. Reared in the sunshine, blasted by the storms, Of changing time, scarce asking why or whence, Men come and go like vegetable forms, Though heaven appoints for them a work immense, Demanding constant thought and zeal intense, Awaked by hopes and fears that leave no room For rest to mortals in the dread suspense, While yet they know not if beyond the tomb A long, long life of bliss or wo shall be their doom. XCVIII. What matter whether pain or pleasures fill The swelling heart one little moment here? From both alike how vain is every thrill While an untried eternity is near! Think not of rest, fond man, in life's career; The joys and grief that meet thee, dash aside Like bubbles, and thy bark right onward steer Through calm and tempest till it cross the tide, Shoot into port in triumph, or serenely glide. XCIX. And thou to whom long worshipped nature lends No strength to fly from grief or bear its weight, Stop not to rail at foes or fickle friends, Nor set the world at nought, nor spurn at fate; None seek thy misery, none thy being hate; Break from thy former self, thy life begin; Do thou the good thy thoughts oft meditate, And thou shalt feel the good man's peace within, And at thy dying day his wreath of glory win. C. With deeds of virtue to embalm his name He dies in triumph or serene delight; Weaker and weaker grows his mortal frame At every breath, but in immortal might His spirit grows, preparing for its flight; The world recedes and fades like clouds of even, But heaven comes nearer fast, and grows more bright, All intervening mists far off are driven;â The world will vanish soon, and all will soon be heaven. CI. Wouldst thou from sorrow find a sweet relief? Or is thy heart oppressed with woes untold? Balm wouldst thou gather for corroding grief? Pour blessings round thee like a shower of gold; 'Tis when the rose is wrapt in many a fold Close to its heart, the worm is wasting there Its life and beauty; not, when all unrolled, Leaf after leaf its bosom rich and fair Breathes freely its perfumes throughout the ambient air. CII. Wake thou that sleepest in enchanted bowers, Lest these lost years should haunt thee on the night When death is waiting for thy numbered hours To take take their swift and everlasting flight; Wake ere the earth-born charm unnerve thee quite, And be thy thoughts to work divine addressed; Do somethingâdo it soonâwith all thy might; An angel's wing would droop if long at rest, And God himself inactive were no longer blest. CIII. Some high or humble enterprise of good Contemplate till it shall possess thy mind, Become thy study, pastime, rest, and food, And kindle in thy heart a flame refined; Pray Heaven for firmness thy whole soul to bind To this thy purposeâto begin, pursue, With thoughts all fixed and feelings purely kind, Strength to complete, and with delight review, And grace to give the praise where all is ever due. CIV. No good of worth sublime will heaven permit To light on man as from the passing air; The lamp of genius though by nature lit, If not protected, pruned, and fed with care, Soon dies or runs to waste with fitful glare, And learning is a plant that spreads and towers Slow as Columbia's aloe, proudly rare, That 'mid gay thousands with the suns and showers Of half a century, grows alone before it flowers. CV. Has immortality of name been given To them that idly worship hills and groves, And burn sweet incense to the queen of heaven? Did Newton learn from fancy as it roves, To measure worlds and follow where each moves? Did Howard gain renown that shall not cease, By wanderings wild that nature's pilgrim loves? Or did Paul gain heaven's glory and its peace By musing o'er the bright and tranquil isles of Greece? CVI. Beware lest thou from sloth, that would appear But lowliness of mind, with joy proclaim Thy want of worth; a charge thou couldst not hear From other lips, without a blush of shame, Or pride indignant; then be thine the blame, And make thyself of worth; and thus enlist The smiles of all the good, the dear to fame; 'Tis infamy to die and not be missed, Or let all soon forget that thou didst e'er exist. CVII. Rouse to some work of high and holy love, And thou an angel's happiness shalt know,â Shalt bless the earth while in the world above, The good begun by thee shall onward flow In many a branching stream, and wider grow; The seed that in these few and fleeting hours, Thy hands unsparing and unwearied sow, Shall deck thy grave, with amaranthine flowers, And yield thee fruits divine in heaven's immortal bowers.</field>
