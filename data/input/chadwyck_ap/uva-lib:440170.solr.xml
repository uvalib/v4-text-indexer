      <field name="fulltext">TO HER WHOSE VIRTUES AND EARNEST AFFECTION ARE THE PRIDE AND HAPPINESS OF MY LIFE; TO THE SWEETEST ROSE OF GEORGIA, I DEDICATE THIS LITTLE VOLUME. THE REAPER. How still Earth lies!—behind the pines The summer clouds sink slowly down. The sunset gilds the higher hills And distant steeples of the town. Refreshed and moist the meadow spreads, Birds sing from out the dripping leaves, And standing in the breast-high corn I see the farmer bind his sheaves. It was when on the fallow fields The heavy frosts of winter lay, A rustic with unsparing hand Strewed seed along the furrowed way. And I too, walking through the waste And wintry hours of the past, Have in the furrows made by griefs The seeds of future harvests cast. Rewarded well, if when the world Grows dimmer in the ebbing light, And all the valley lies in shade, But sunset glimmers on the height. Down in the meadows of the heart The birds sing out a last refrain, And ready garnered for the mart I see the ripe and golden grain. 1847. TO MY VERY DEAR SISTER. No need is there of being wise To read the love within thine eyes; Thy love thou canst not all disguise. Thy hair is brown, thy eyes are gray, And many tender things they say; (Sweet eyes, thus speak to me alway!) Thy forehead white beneath its veins Soft throbbing, secret wealth contains, Fair fruit of fertilizing rains. For often, lying in the shade, Thy tresses loosened from their braid, An open book before thee laid; Thou readest many wondrous things That give unto thy spirit wings; And dreamy old imaginings. But more than tress or witching eyes, Or all that therein hidden lies, Thy love I infinitely prize. Thy love is like a joyous rill That rippling down life's rugged hill, The crevices with gold-dust fill. Let others covet gold:—for me, In thy great love great wealth I see, Nor more endowed I care to be. 1846. GEORGIANA. A mother sits beside her child With lips God only knows when smiled, And eyes with watching weary, Her bosom grieving, throbbing, aching, As one from hideous dreams awaking, Throughout that darkness dreary. She hears the night-bird from the wood Mourn in his sable feather hood, She hears her own heart beating. The dull watch ticking 'gainst the wall, The leaves that rustle as they fall Across the window fleeting. The shadows waving to and fro, Across the bedclothes noiseless go, Across the face of Death. The bloodless cheeks their life regain, And part the pallid lips again, Yet part without a breath. The golden locks, the waveless breast, The silken lashes soft that rest Upon the marble face: All that was pure, beloved, and bright, All that is chill and clothed in night, Sleeps in the shroud's embrace. Not swiftly spent, but day by day This mother noted pass away The life with anguish sore. A sea retreating wave by wave, That ebbing left to view the grave Deep yawning in the shore. Oh Niobé, who thus dost mourn A daughter from thy bosom torn, Oh plaining heart, be dumb. Tu qui cuncta scis et vales, Qui nos pacis hic mortales Jesu da solatium. AMY. This is the pathway where she walked, The tender grass pressed by her feet. The laurel boughs laced overhead, Shut out the noonday heat. The sunshine gladly stole between The softly undulating limbs. From every blade and leaf arose The myriad insect hymns. A brook ran murmuring beneath The grateful twilight of the trees, Where from the dripping pebbles swelled A beech's mossy knees. And there her robe of spotless white, (Pure white such purity beseemed!) Her angel face and tresses bright Within the basin gleamed. The coy sweetbriers half detained Her light hem as we moved along! To hear the music of her voice The mockbird hushed his song. But now her little feet are still, Her lips the Everlasting seal; The hideous secrets of the grave The weeping eyes reveal. The path still winds, the brook descends, The skies are bright as then they were. My Amy is the only leaf In all that forest sear. 1845. TO A LILY. Go bow thy head in gentle spite, Thou lily white. For she who spies thee waving here, With thee in beauty can compare As day with night. Soft are thy leaves and white: Her arms Boast whiter charms. Thy stem prone bent with loveliness Of maiden grace possesseth less: Therein she charms. Thou in thy lake dost see Thyself: So she Beholds her image in her eyes Reflected. Thus did Venus rise From out the sea. Inconsolate, bloom not again Thou rival vain Of her whose charms have thine outdone: Whose purity might spot the sun, And make thy leaf a stain. 1845. QUÆ CARIOR? Behold, nor lands nor gold have I, Yet great my riches are: My treasure stands without a guard, My door without a bar. Ye who would wealthy live and die, Go seek a love like this: Quis pudor desiderio Tam cari capitis? “Quis desiderio sit pudor aut modus Tam cari capitis?”— Horat. The eyes, the locks, the lips, the smile, Not these my love retain. A Venus trusting in her charms Assails my breast in vain. The soul serene that taper-like Burns quietly within; The gentle kindliness of heart And purity from sin. The blood that flushes in her cheek, Flows in my every vein; The good old blood of ancient times Without reproach or stain! Right loth am I to own our Sires, Stout Huguenots of yore, From Anjou, Maine, or Languedoc, So bright a jewel bore. I love her arm to lean on mine To guide her steps aright; I love her eyes to speak to me Affection pure and bright. And proud within my heart am I That, come what may, the arm On which she rests is strong enough To shelter her from harm. She tells me all her little joys, Her troubles and her fears, I smile with her, I share her grief, I kiss away her tears. And thus we journey hand in hand Along this path of ours: The thorns we crush beneath our feet, Our bosoms hold the flowers. 1844. GEORGIA. Thou, like a dove, dost make thy moan, Although thou utterest no tone, Nor pleadest with thy voice alone. The pallid brow beneath thy hair, Thy gentle uncomplaining air, Make captives of us unaware. Why art thou armèd otherwise Than Nature made thee, since thine eyes An host within themselves comprise? The axe may do a king's behest, Keen lances pierce the stubborn breast, Thy eyes—they rob us of our rest! Ah, weary eyes with watching sore, And suffering, that evermore Look back, afraid to look before: And thou who on thy bed forlorn, In pain, hast often watched the dawn, Sad sighing—‘will it ne'er be morn?’ Take heart: I see thee blooming grow As erst, where balmy zephyrs blow, And blue waves ripple to and fro. And like that sea, a tide will wake In thy young heart, no more to make The truant blood thy cheek forsake. No longer wilt thou drooping stand, With thy poor, pale, blue-veinéd hand, (The costliest gift in all the land!) Sun warmed thy cheek will grow, and brown. Health will become thee as a crown, And light will smile where night did frown. And thou shalt clearly then perceive That God did only make thee grieve More elevated faith to leave. As costly diamonds in their lees, Washed from beneath the roots of trees By torrents, find the Bengalese. 1845. HAW-BLOSSOMS. While yesterevening, through the vale Descending from my cottage door I strayed, how cool and fresh a look All nature wore. The calmïas and golden-rods, And tender blossoms of the haw, Like maidens seated in the wood, Demure, I saw. The recent drops upon their leaves Shone brighter than the bluest eyes And filled the little sheltered dell Their fragrant sighs. Their pliant arms they interlaced, As pleasant canopies they were: Their blossoms swung against my cheek Like braids of hair. And when I put their boughs aside And stooped to pass, from overhead The little agitated things A shower shed Of tears. Then thoughtfully I spoke; Well represent ye maidenhood, Sweet flowers. Life is to the young A shady wood. And therein some like golden-rods, For grosser purposes designed, A gay existence lead, but leave No germ behind. And others like the calmïas, On cliff-sides inaccessible, Bloom paramount, the vale with sweets Yet never fill. But underneath the glossy leaves, When, working out the perfect law, The blossoms white and fragrant still Drop from the haw; Like worthy deeds in silence wrought And secret, through the lapse of years, In clusters pale and delicate The fruit appears. In clusters pale and delicate But waxing heavier each day, Until the many-colored leaves Drift from the spray. Then pendulous, like amethysts And rubies, purple ripe and red, Wherewith God's feathered pensioners In flocks are fed. Therefore, sweet reader of this rhyme, Be unto thee examples high Not calmïas and golden-rods That scentless die: But the meek blossoms of the haw, That fragrant are wherever wind The forest paths, and perishing Leave fruits behind. 1846. AHAB-MOHAMMED. A peasant stood before a king and said; ‘My children starve, I come to thee for bread.’ On cushions soft and silken sat enthroned The king, and looked on him that prayed and moaned. Who cried again;—‘for bread I come to thee.’ For grief, like wine, the tongue will render free. Then said the prince with simple truth; ‘Behold I sit on cushions silken-soft, of gold And wrought with skill the vessels which they bring To fitly grace the banquet of a king. But at my gate the Mede triumphant beats, And die for food my people in the streets. Yet no good father hears his child complain And gives him stones for bread, for alms disdain. Come, thou and I will sup together—come.’ The wondering courtiers saw—saw, and were dumb: Then followed with their eyes Ahab led With grace the humble guest, amazed, to share his bread. Him half abashed the royal host withdrew Into a room, the curtained doorway through. Silent behind the folds of purple closed, In marble life the statues stood disposed: From the high ceiling, perfume breathing, hung Lamps rich, pomegranate-shaped, and golden-swung. Gorgeous the board with massive metal shone, Gorgeous with gems arose in front a throne: These through the Orient lattice saw the sun. If gold there was, of meat and bread was none Save one small loaf; this stretched his hand and took Ahab Mahommed, prayed to God, and broke: One half his yearning nature bid him crave, The other gladly to his guest he gave. ‘I have no more to give’—he cheerly said; ‘With thee I share my only loaf of bread.’ Humbly the stranger took the offered crumb Yet ate not of it, standing meek and dumb: Then lifts his eyes,—the wondering Ahab saw His rags fall from him as the snow in thaw. Resplendent, blue, those orbs upon him turned: All Ahab's soul within him throbbed and burned. Ahab Mahommed, spoke the vision then; From this thou shalt be blessèd among men. Go forth—thy gates the Mede bewildered flees, And Allah thank thy people on their knees. He who gives somewhat does a worthy deed, Of him the recording angel shall take heed. But he that halves all that his house doth hold, His deeds are more to God, yea more than finest gold. 1846. QUÆ PULCHRIOR? I woo thee, thou bright One, With soul and with song. Thy praise from my bosom Flows fervid and strong. I'll teach thee the love That Euridyce knew, When the passionate hand Of her Orpheus drew Sweet words from his lyre. I seek not, (as Danæ Jove conquered of old,) To dazzle thy vision With showers of gold. No jewels I bring thee, No titled renown. But the lover has hope, And the poet a crown For the queen of his bosom. The blue veinéd temples Thy soft tresses bind; Thy knowledge, thy genius, Thy carcanet mind; Thy gentlest of voices, Thy sunshiny smile, Thy silken lashed eye-lids, Thy lips without guile, If e'er such were created. Thy white glancing shoulders, Thy ivory arms— What pencil can paint thee, What lip chaunt thy charms! Superb as a Queen is, Yet gentle and kind. Where sunny-eyed beauty, Thy mate can I find? (In thy heart's depth, you murmur.) Thy soul as a lake is, Deep, waveless, and pure. Thy heart as an ocean That meeteth no shore. Thou, child of Minerva, A Venus doth stand. What gift shall I bring thee To kiss the white hand Lying passive in mine? Thou knowest,—no longer, With lance lain in rest, The chosen one doeth His charmer's behest. No longer, tall nodding, His love-lifted plume, Floats fleet as a meteor Through battle and gloom, In the front of the tempest. Lo, spacious and wide Are the lists of the world, Though corslet be rusted, And battle-flag furled: As matchless the glances Of beauty—as proud The chaplet—the voice Of the clarion as loud, As at Bayard's command. We earn not these laurels Through rage and turmoil: No blood-stain the wreath Of the scholar doth soil: No tear of the anguished Can blister that leaf Whose winning hath cost not One doating heart grief, Through the breadth of the land. Oh, far, far more radiant Olympia's crown, Than Rome's haughty purple Or Sylla's renown. Thou—beautiful, glorious; I—loveless and plain: What can I—what must I, Thy love to obtain, With a hope that is dearer? I steer on an ocean Broad, stormy and wild, With heart of a giant, With arm of a child. My heaven's vast blackness Doth hold but one star. I worship—I woo thee, Bright maid, from afar. Saidest thou,—‘come then nearer?’ 1844. WOMAN OF CANAAN. Once there came a woman weeping, Weeping to the Savior's feet, She had left her daughter sleeping Grievously consumed by heat. Through the crowd the troubled mother Striving anxiously to see, Cried unto the wondrous stranger; ???????, ??????? ??. When she saw the Lord had passed her Heeding not, she worshipped near, Saying;—Heal her, gentle Master: Saying;—Holy Master, hear. Looking on her, Jesus answered; Think you it is meet to give Unto dogs the bread of children, Bread whereby the children live? But this woman full of sorrow, Full of woman's hope and love, Trusting earnestly, did borrow Wisdom from a source above. Truth,—she meekly answered, Master, Yet they have their own award; For the dogs are fed with fragments From the table of their Lord. Marvelled much our Lord's disciples, Such exalted faith to find In the kneeling Canaanitess. Unto her no longer blind, Then said Jesus; As thou willest Be it to thee even now. Rise and go unto thy daughter; ?????? ? ?????? ???. Quick she rose and went rejoicing, Went rejoicing on her way; Flew unto the little chamber Where her child had lain the day. Pale and heavy-eyed no longer, Healed and beauteous to see, Came the maiden to the mother, Sobbing;—???? ???, ?????. Happy in the dread hereafter, Threefold happy wilt thou be, Seeing Christ compassionately, Meek one, looking upon thee. Then thy heart will beat with gladness, Saying; Blessedest art thou Unto whom our Lord has spoken; ?????? ? ?????? ???. 1846. ORNITHOLOGOI. Thou, sitting on the hill-top bare, Dost see the far hills disappear In Autumn smoke, and all the air Filled with bright leaves. Below thee spread Are breast-high harvests, and the red Wide fallow fields: while overhead The jays to one another call, And through the stilly woods there fall Ripe nuts at intervals, where'er The squirrel perched in upper air, From tree-top barks at thee his fear: His cunning eyes mistrustingly Do spy at thee around the tree, Then prompted by a sudden whim, Down leaping on the quivering limb Gains the smooth hickory, from whence He nimbly scours along the fence To secret haunts. But thou, where roar The pine woods in long corridor, Sonorously and evermore, When through the budding shrubs descried Green slope the fields on every side; When jasmines and azalias fill The air with sweets, and down the hill Turbid no more descends the rill, The wonder of thy hazel eyes Soft opening on the misty skies, Dost smile within thyself to see Things uncontained in, seemingly, The open book upon thy knee: And through the quiet woodlands hear Sounds full of mystery to ear Of grosser mould; bird-voices, deer Bleets, the innumerable cries That from the teeming world arise; Which we, self-confidently wise, Pass by unheeding. Thou did'st yearn From thy weak babyhood to learn Arcana of creation; turn Thy eyes on things intangible To mortals; when the earth was still, Hear dreamy voices on the hill In wavy woods, that sent a thrill Of joyousness through thy young veins. Ah, happy thou, whose seeking gains All that thou lovest, man disdains; A sympathy in joys and pains With dwellers in the long green lanes, With wings that shady groves explore, With watchers at the torrent's roar, And waders by the reedy shore. For Nature, through thy purity, Is open as a book to thee. Croak, croak.—Who croaketh overhead So hoarsely, with his pinion spread Dabbled in blood and dripping red. Croak, croak:—a RAVEN'S curse on him The giver of this shattered limb. Albeit young, (a hundred years, When next the forest leaved appears!) Will Duskywing behold this breast Shot-riddled, or divide my nest With wearer of so tattered vest? I see myself with wing awry Approaching; Duskywing will spy My altered air, and shun my eye. With laughter bursting, through the wood The birds will scream;—‘she's quite too good For thee.’ And yonder meddling Jay, I hear him chatter all the day; ‘He's crippled,—send the thief away.’— At every hop—‘don't let him stay!’ I'll catch thee yet, despite my wing, For all thy fine blue plumes thou'lt sing Another song! Is't not enough The carrion in the swamp we snuff, And gathering down upon the breeze, Release the valley from disease. If longing for more fresh a meal, Around the tender flock we wheel, A marksman doth some bush conceal. This very morn I heard an ewe Bleat in the thicket; there I flew With lazy wing slow circling round, Until I spied unto the ground A lamb by tangled briers bound. The ewe meanwhile from hillock-side Bleat to her young—so loudly cried She heard it not when it replied. Ho, ho—a feast!—I 'gan to croak, Alighting straightway on an oak; Whence gloatingly I eyed aslant The little trembler lie and pant: Leaped nimbly thence upon its head; Down its white nostril bubbled red A gush of blood. Ere life had fled My beak was buried in its eyes Turned tearfully upon the skies, Strong grew my voice and weak its cries— No longer could'st thou sit and hear This demon prate in open air Deeds horrible to maiden ear. Begone!—thou spokest. Overhead The startled fiend his pinion spread, And croaking maledictions, fled. But hark:—who at some secret door Knocks loud and knocketh evermore. Thou seëst how around the tree, With scarlet head for hammer, he Probes where the haunts of insects be. The worn in labyrinthian hole Begins his sluggard length to roll: But crafty Rufus spies the prey, And with his mallet beats away The loose bark crumbling with decay. Then chirping loud, with wing elate He bears the morsel to his mate. His mate, she sitteth on her nest, In sober feather garments dressed, A matron underneath whose breast Three little tender heads appear. With bills distent from ear to ear, Each clamors for the larger share: And whilst they clamor, climb, and lo Upon the margin to and fro, Unsteady poised, one wavers slow. Stay, stay;—the parents anguished, shriek— Too late: For venturesome yet weak, His frail legs falter under him, He falls,—but from a lower limb A moment dangles; thence again Launched out upon the air: in vain He spreads his little plumeless wing, A poor blind, dizzy, helpless thing. But thou, who all did'st see and hear, Young, active, wast already there And caught the flutterer, in air. Then up the tree to topmost limb, A vine for ladder, borest him. Against thy cheek his little heart Beat soft. Ah, trembler that thou art; Thou spokest smiling; comfort thee. With joyous cries, the parents flee Thy presence none; confidingly Pour out their earnest hearts to thee. The Mockbird sees thy tenderness Of deed; doth with melodiousness In many tongues thy praise express. And all the while, his dappled wings He claps his sides with as he sings, From perch to perch his body flings. A poet he, to ecstasy Wrought by the sweets his tongue doth say. Who shouts so loud?—Hallo, hallo! Who in the pine-top to and fro Rocks gallantly? Ha, brother Crow, Why cawest thou so loud, below? Caw—caw: Last spring good Roger came And sowed his corn: a tenth we claim. Look you, I wear a satin hood Blue-black and monkish, reason good For taking tithe of all we would According to the good old law. Caw—caw! quoth I. ‘I'll stop your “caw” Quoth Roger; Ever mortal saw Such a lean, lazy lizzard thing! No longer will I tatters bring To fright him off, his neck I'll wring.’ Since then has Roger soon and late, With rusty barrel lain in wait. I'm twice as old and thrice as wise As Roger, therefore while he lies, I dig his corn before his eyes. This morning Roger came once more, And sowed a furrow as before. Hey!—muttered I—Here's something strange; The seasons all ha' made a change, Unless a bad account I keep! The fellow's certainly asleep, He sows in Autumn, when 'ill he reap? Off Roger goes: A feast—I cry, A feast! From every furrow nigh The brotherhood their pinions fly, Now while we single grain from grain Right busily, adown the lane Creeps Roger stealthily again. Look to yourselves!—our sentries shriek. With wings grown wonderously weak To rise into mid air we seek; But reeling back, some lie as dead, While others with their pinions spread Flap in the dust. Amid the din Of cawing, Roger runneth in: In either hand around he slings An anguished trunk with panting wings, Then off the headless carcass flings. I who had played the host, and fed But sparingly, in season fled To pine-top. Never farmer reaped So cursèd crop; in spirits steeped, His maize a hideous harvest yields, A malediction on his fields. No green and waving blade appears, In place of sweet and golden ears, Blood soppèd fruit his furrow bears. Although a crafty profligate, Thou heardest him his grief relate, With sympathy. Will man abate, (Thou saidest), nevermore his hate To these, nor with the helpless share That which without diviner care Unrecompense of labor were. Ah, let him give, but cheerfully To them that now so fearfully Flit up, and from his presence flee, And he will smiling harvests see Where indigence was wont to be. For God loves all, and does not give Life only, but the means to live. Stay, stay—what small wings flutter now Beneath yon flowering alder bough? Therefrom a little plaintive voice, That did at early morn rejoice, Makes a most sad yet sweet complaint, Saying; ‘My heart is very faint With its unutterable wo. What shall I do, where shall I go, My cruel anguish to abate? Oh, my poor desolated mate! Dear Cherry, will our hawbush seek Joyful, and beaming in her beak Fresh seeds, and such like dainties won By patient search: But they are gone Whom she did brood and dote upon. Oh, if there be a mortal ear My sorrowful complaint to hear; If manly breast is ever stirred By wrong done to a helpless bird; To them for quick redress I cry.’ Moved by the prayer, and drawing nigh, On alder branch thou didst espy How sitting lonely and forlorn, His breast was pressed upon a thorn, Unknowing that he leaned thereon. Then bidding him take heart again, Thou rannest down into the lane To seek the doer of this wrong. Nor under hedgerow hunted long, When, sturdy, rude and sun-embrowned, A child thy earnest seeking found. To him in sweet and modest tone Thou madest straight thy errand known; With gentle eloquence did'st show (Things erst he surely did not know,) How great an evil he had done: How, when next year the mild May sun Renewed its warmth, this shady lane No timid birds would haunt again; And how around his mother's door The robins, yearly guests before He knew their names, would come no more. But if his prisoners he released Before their little bosoms ceased To palpitate, each coming year Would find them gladly reäppear To sing his praises everywhere, The sweetest, dearest songs to hear. And afterwards, when came the term Of ripened corn, the robber worm Would hunt through every blade and turn, Impatient thus his smile to earn. At first, flushed, angrily, and proud, He answered thee with laughter loud And brief retort. But thou did'st speak So mild, so earnestly did'st seek To change his mood, in wonder first He eyed thee, then no longer durst Raise his bold glances to thy face; But looking down, began to trace, With little naked foot and hand, Thoughtful devices in the sand. And when at last thou did'st relate The sad affliction of the mate When to the well known spot she came, He hung his head for very shame. His penitential tears to hide, His face averted, while he cried; ‘Here take them all, I've no more pride In climbing up to rob a nest: I've better feelings in my breast.’ Then thanking him with heart and eyes, Thou tookest from his grasp the prize, And bid the little freedmen rise. But when thou sawest how too weak Their pinions were, the nest did seek, And called thy client: Down he flew Instant, and with him Cherry too. And flitting after, not a few Of the minuter feathered race Filled with their chirpings all the place: From hedge and pendant branch and vine Recounted still that deed of thine; Still sang thy praises o'er and o'er Gladly: more heartily, be sure, Were praises never sung before. Beholding thee, they understand (These Minnesingers of the land) How thou apart from all dost stand Full of great love and tenderness For all God's creatures: these express Thy hazel eyes. With life instinct All things that are, to thee are linked By subtle ties; and none so mean, Or loathsome, hast thou ever seen, But wonderous in make hath been. Compassionate, thou knowest none Of insect tribes beneath the sun That thou can'st set thy heel upon. A sympathy thou hast with wings In groves, and with all living things. Unmindful if they walk or crawl, The same arm shelters each and all, The shadow of the curse and fall Alike impends. Ah, truly great, Who strivest earnestly and late A single atom to abate Of helpless wo and misery. For very often thou dos't see How sadly and how helplessly A pleading face looks up to thee. Therefore it is, thou can'st not choose With petty tyranny to abuse Thy higher gifts: And justly fear The feeblest worm of earth or air In thy heart's judgment to condemn, Since God made thee, and God made them. 1846. A PARABLE. I lay one night and saw a dream That thus, Irene appeared: I saw sit shivering by a stream A maiden silken-haired. Her tender arms dejectly crossed, Her radiant head bent down; In melancholy fancies lost, Her eyelids sought the ground. ‘All things in nature harmonize, And sorrows joys enhance; Why when the sunshine golden lies, Art thou in mournful trance? ‘Why mournest thou?’ I said, and took Her hands within mine own. —All calmness straight my soul forsook With tenderness o'erflown. But lo, while thus the child apart My arms encircling held, And pressed against my throbbing heart, Her bosom throbbed and swelled; My lifted eyes a mocking crowd Beheld about us stand: With well-bred air each phantom bowed, And smiled behind his hand. ‘Why smile ye, Sirs?’—I briefly cried: ‘Why come ye here at all?’ ‘Faith,’ spoke a Shade, ‘thy bosom's pride Hath sat beside us all! ‘We, as you see us standing here, In turn have shared her heart. A new Alcina charms thy ear, And thou her Roland art. ‘Not long its fragrance keeps the rose That blooms to every gale. For her who broadcast love bestows, My heart is cased in mail.’ Thus spoke in courteous tones the Shade, Sarcastic smiled and turned. With blushes burning stood the maid; For me,—I no more burned! Read me this parable, Irene, That I may judge aright If visions such by day are seen, Or only haunt the night. 1846. TO ALCINA. Cease to move me, gentle Venus, Thou Minerva, spread between us All thy books: That what is heinous In her treating, I repeating Once for all, may then forget her. (Banishment than hate is better.) How is this?—her eyes are tender, Softly smiles she, white and slender Are her hands!—The Furies lend her Charms. Enchanting Flies she panting, To my bosom: Taken,—warmèd, She is to an asp transformèd! Out upon my childish dreaming, Out upon the cheating seeming, That deceived me! Crafty, gleaming, Saw I never How for ever In her hand a blade was holden, Sheath whereof was silk and golden. Well, despise me if thou choosest: Nothing by thy hate thou losest. Heart of mine alone refuseth To be chided, To be guided Into hating where it perished. (Better, loving, had it perished!) 1846. TOCCOA. Toccoa and Tallulah, two falls in Upper Georgia. The first a mere rivulet falling in seldom more than a shower of spray from the edge of a lofty cliff into a lovely and secluded valley; the last, an impetuous torrent, raging down the gigantic granite steps at the head of a barranca upwards of a thousand feet deep, and whose gloomy grandeur is most impressive when a black cloud closes the narrow aperture overhead, and the towering precipices on either hand reverberate the deafening crash of the thunder. Can I forget that happiest day, That happiest day of all the year, When on the sloping rock I lay, Toccoa dripping near? The lifted wonder of thy eyes The marvel of thy soul expressed. Aloft I saw serenest skies, Below, thy heaving breast. On wings of mist, in robes of spray Long trailed, and flowing wide and white, Adown the mountain steep and gray We saw Toccoa glide. Her garments sweeping through the vale, Began the whispering leaves to wake, And wafted like a tiny sail A leaf across the lake. The murmur of the falling shower Which did the solitude increase, We heard; the cool and happy hour Filled our young hearts with peace. Thou satest with a maiden grace, Thou sawest the rugged rocks and hoary, As with a half-uplifted face Thou listenedst to my story. How many of the banished race, Those old red warriors of the bow, Have slumbered in this shadowy place, Have watched Toccoa flow. Perchance, where now we sit, they laid Their arms, and raised a boastful chaunt, While through the gorgeous Autumn shade The sunshine shot aslant. One night, a hideous howling night, The black boughs swaying overhead,— Three painted Braves across the height A false Pe-ro-kah Lit. ‘Evil-child.’ led. Bright were her glances, bright her smiles, Wonderous her waving length of hair, (Ye who descend through slippery wiles, A maiden's eyes beware!) What saw these swarthy Cherokees In the deep darkness on the brink? They saw a red fire through the trees, Through the tossed branches wave and wink; They saw pale faces white and dreaming, Clutched their keen knives, and held their breath, —All this was but a cheating seeming, For them, not for the phantoms death. Spoke then the temptress—(maid, or devil,) ‘Let the pale sleepers sleep no more!’ Whoop!—three good bounds on solid rock, Then empty blackness for a floor. Yelled the fierce Braves with rage and fright, With fright their bristling war plumes rose: On these down fluttering, did the night Her jaws sepulchral close. These rocks tall-lifted, rent apart, This Indian legend old To thee, enchantress as thou art, A warning truth unfold. Who love, 'mid midnight dangers stand, To them false fires wink: Accurséd be the evil hand That beckons to the brink. 1845. TALLULAH. Recollect thou, in thunder How Tallulah spoke to thee, When thy little face with wonder Lifted upwards, rocks asunder Riven, shattered, Black and battered, Thou aloft didst see? Downward stalking through Tempesta, Did a giant shape appear. All the waters leaping after Hound-like, with their thunder-laughter Shook the valley Teocalli, Hill-top bleak and bare. Vast and ponderous, of granite, Cloud enwrapt his features were. In his great calm eyes emotion Glimmered none; and like an ocean Billowy, tangled, Foam bespangled Backward streamed his hair. On his brow like dandelions Nodded pines: the solid floor Rocked and reeled beneath his treading, Black on high a tempest spreading, Pregnant, passive, As with massive Portal, closed the corridor. Frighted, sobbing, clinging to me In an agony of dread, Sawest thou this form tremendous Striding down the steep stupendous With the torrent: Night abhorrent Closing overhead. Then my heart dissembling courage, That thine own so loudly beat. Comfort thee, I said, poor trembler: Providence is no dissembler. Higher power Guards each flower Blooming at thy feet. Flushed and tearful from my bosom Thereat thou did'st lift thy face. Blue and wide thy eyes resplendent, Turned upon the phantom pendent, Whose huge shadow Overshadowed All the gloomy place. Back revolving into granite, Foam and fall and nodding pine, Sank the phantom. Slantwise driven Through the storm-cloud rent and riven, Sunshine glittered And there twittered— Birds in every vine Then sonorous from the chasm Pealed a voice distinct and loud: ‘Innocence and God-reliance Set all evil at defiance. Maiden, by these, (As by snow, trees,) Evil heads are bowed.’ 1845. ON THE DEATH OF A KINSMAN. Hon. Hugh S. Legaré. I see an Eagle winging to the sun— Who sayeth him nay? He glanceth down from where his wing hath won: His heart is stout, his flight is scarce begun,— Oh hopes of clay! Saw he not how upon the cord was lain A keen swift shaft; How Death wrought out in every throbbing vein, In every after agony of pain, His bitter craft! Like old Demetrius, the sun had he Beheld so long, Now things of earth no longer could he see, And in his ear sang Immortality A pleasant song. Icarus like, he fell when warm and near The sunshine smiled: He rose strong-pinioned in his high career— —Thy dust remains, thy glorious spirit where, Minerva's child? Therefore him Fame had written fair and high Upon her scroll, Who fell like sudden meteor from the sky, Who strenuous to win at last did die E'en at the goal. June 21st, 1843. TO ANNE. Disconsolate and ill at ease The heart that is, a future sees Affording nought to cheer or please. But she that owns a quiet mind To good or evil fate resigned, No great unhappiness can find In any lot. A child in years, Already have maturer cares Oppressed thee, and thy eyes to tears No strangers are. Fair, fresh, and young, Thrice bitterly thy heart was wrung. For what had they to do with thee, In thy spring days, despondency, Or any woful mysteries? Yet when thy eyes were no more blind With weeping, self-possessed, resigned, Preëminent arose thy mind. And resolute in doing well, Didst henceforth teach thy breast to swell With nought that maiden will could quell. Thou sawest how man breathes a day Before re-mingling with his clay: How feeble in Almighty ken The most omnipotent of men Appears: And how the longest life Is one short struggle in the strife That rocks the world from age to age. What worthy hand may write the page Whose Alexandrine words unbind Thy upwardly directed mind? One beat triumphant of the wings, And dust no more about thee clings, And all the galaxy of things Intangible and vast, expand, So that thou mayest safely stand On hitherto a quaking sand. Yet must this excellence be wrought Not by companionship with thought Alone: By tracing down the stream Of life, the glitter of a dream: By repetition vain of creeds: No,—it is by thy deeds—THY DEEDS, The flowers will o'ertop the weeds In thy God's-garden. Cheerfully Do that allotted is to thee, And fashion out thy destiny; So that the tomb-doors may not be Dreaded and dark, but ope to thee A heaven far as thou can'st see. 1846. THE TWO GIVERS. Every morning, every morrow, When at noon I cross the river, Thee I thank right heartily That thou art so kind a giver. There it is, we nightly linger, Gazing down into the stream; It is like a nightly vision, It is like a pleasant dream. For we see, in silence standing With thy fingers locked in mine, In the waters darkly flowing All the greater planets shine. From the bridge and from the barges On the river, redder lights Gleam: Beyond the sleeping village Others show along the heights. All the city lies behind us, Like a hive with busy cells; And it warns how time is flying, By the chiming of its bells. All the city lies behind us, And the toil of human hands: But the better God-creation Visible before us stands. When Diana dimly rising Through the openwork of trees, On the cliff-sides, on the steeples Travels down by slow degrees Silently the pallid splendor, Till behind our shadows stream, Like the shapes uncouth and dismal We encounter in a dream. Then the cool and quiet hour Tranquillizes all my soul; I no longer thirst for wisdom And for worldly self-control. Thee I thank with tenderness, That thou bearest with my faults; Knowing thou dost love me truly, All my better self exalts. And with stronger gratitude Thank the Universal Giver, For the cool and quiet evening, For the woods and flowing river. Grateful most that he hath planted Pleasure in these hearts of ours, Not in works and world endeavors, But the sight and scent of flowers. 1846. WHY SHE LOVES ME. It is happiness to be Loved by one so good as she, Loved, and that so tenderly. ‘Why is it she loves me so?’ Into the deep woods I go Pondering, that I may know. Underneath the branches spread Green and tentlike overhead, Full of happiness I tread. Soon I find a pleasant seat Hidden from the summer heat, Leaves and flowers at my feet. Opposite, around a tree Climbs a vine, most tenderly Clasping it and fair to see. Through the fanlike leaves appear Pendulous like braids of hair, Slender bunches everywhere. Truly now I understand Why, and guided by what hand, I alone her heart command. Outwardly she sees me rough: That my heart of better stuff Is,—she knoweth well enough. What is it to her or me, If of all ill-judged I be, So that understandeth she. Well, if she can trust me so, When the winds begin to blow, Place of shelter shall she know. During Winters long and drear, When the fruits all disappear, Snow and sorrow everywhere, She shall in my arms remain, Comforted and quit of pain, Till the Summers come again. 1846. THE WELCOME RAIN. The beating rain I will with hateful eyes behold again No more, if it my Love restrain. In haste she goes; But rains incessant fall, and like a rose My heart invigorate and fresher grows. Now must she stay, Since heaven itself gives reasons for delay; The long black road and canopy of gray. She loves me so, It would be misery for her to go Uncomforted by me, I dare to know. With mournful eyes She anxiously regards the sullen skies, And for the dread of going, not of staying, sighs. Whene'er she sees The beating drops, they are the swarming bees That fetch us honey; so her heart decrees. When I beheld At dawn the driving clouds, my bosom swelled With bitter thoughts and inwardly rebelled. For then I thought That I a hateful patience should be taught, And she would sit expectant and unsought; But now I know, How over sodden graves meek blossoms blow, Luxuriant the more for what's below. Henceforth, no rain To bear, will I ungratefully complain, If it this once my Love, my Life, detain. 1846. LOQUITUR DIANA. My temples on my arm I lean, While glides Diana through the screen Of tall and overhanging trees, Until my lifted face she sees, And book spread idly on my knees. High overheard the leaves are stirred: From tree to tree, remotely heard The katydid's incessant call: Still through the boughs and over all, The silver shafts of Dian fall. Oh Dian, thou who from thy skies Dost nightly look into her eyes, (Her brown eyes unto thee upturned) Say if her heart hath ever burned As mine for her hath yearned? Remembers she each summer night When we beheld thee, from the height, The silent woods of gloom deliver: And saw in eddies of the river Thy arrows fall and shiver. Caressingly I held in mine Her little hands: No joys of wine, Or gold, or books in mortal ken, Can yield such happiness again. —Ah, Dian, why repeat them then? (Luna loquitur.) ‘Why bring them back?—Oh murmur vain! Doth not the miser count his gain In coffers hid?—Thou safe and fast Beneath the lid that shuts the past, These golden hours hast. What more would'st thou or any one? A precious heart thy deeds have won For thee. Behold how earnestly With lifted eyes she follows me, Believing that I look on thee.’ 1846. THE RISING OF THE RIVER. While yestereve, still dark and drear With driving clouds the heavens were; And strong and fast The river through the arches past; I crossed the quaking bridge alone, Against whose pediments of stone The surging tide Swept trunks with arms distended wide. With waters flowing broad and red, The level lands were overspread; Their early bloom All withered in a common tomb. The path so often trod of yore No longer traced along the shore, Before my eyes The gloomy stream, the murky skies. Oh heart, (I groaned) in such a sea, Were truth and honor swept from thee, Which should have been As rooted forests, firm and green. The flowers in my breast were drowned By overwhelming passion;—found My feet no more A peaceful path along the shore. But over rising sins and woes, Alike, the simple arches rose Of faith in God, So that from shore to shore I trod. And when, oh Love, serene and fair The heavens are, and reäppear On every lea, The fragrant bloom, the steadfast tree; Then richer for these beating rains When harvest comes, in golden grains That heart will be, That trusted in its God and thee. 1847. A WRECK. When the lost Atlantic, drifted Shoreward, in the surges rolled, By each wave successive lifted, Slowly tolled From the wreck a bell resounding Solemnly across that sounding, Where lay corpses manifold. So, when wrecked are my desires On the everlasting Never, And my heart, with all its fires, Out forever, These fond words, with sad vibration O'er your bosom's desolation Will lament the dead forever. 1847. THE BOOK OF NATURE. (“There are two books,” writes Sir Thomas Browne, in the Religio Medici, “from which I collect my divinity; besides that written one of God, another of his servant Nature—that universal and public manuscript, that lies expanded unto the eyes of all.” ? “Possibly, even the heathens knew better how to join and read these mystical letters, than many Christians, who cast a more careless eye on these common hieroglyphics, and disdain to suck divinity from the flowers of nature.”) The manuscript of Nature's book Is open spread to every eye, But few into the leaves will look That round them lie. In characters both quaint and old, Yet easy to be understood; On every hill and vale unrolled, In every wood. I see the oaks, like belted knights, With sturdy sinews gird the land; As Birnam wood besieged the heights In Malcolm's hand. The solemn brotherhood of pines, Like monks slow chaunting in the choir, Nos miserere: Cypress nuns In sad attire. But where around the opening glade, Aslant the golden light descends, And through alternate sun and shade The footpath wends; And deeper in, the level sward With cooler shadows overspread— (Oh page more worthy of award Than eye hath read!) From root to top the haws are crowned With tïaras of snowy bloom, Through purple violet lips the ground Exhales perfume. And there, unto the poet's heart, Illumined with a thousand dyes, And granite claspings all undone, The volume lies. Be patient, poet—say the Haws; The human heart that flowers bears, Will ripen fruit in autumn days Of after years. Be humble—breathe the Violets; More worthily is honour won, If they a pleasing fragrance find Who looked for none. And if thou—say the Calmias, A pride in exaltation hast, See how our bloom that crowns the cliff Wastes every blast. Love—saith the yellow Jasmine—Love! In vain the storm menaces him Who binds his bosom's tendrils round A steadfast limb. And if indeed a poet's heart Thou hast, who walkest in this wood, Believe that God, in fruit or bloom, Works out some good. 1847. FLOWERS IN ASHES. Where, with unruffled surface wide, The waters of the river glide Between the arches dimly in the early dawn descried; While musing, Sweet, of thee,—once more I crossed the bridge as oft of yore, I saw a shallop issue from the shadow of the shore. With practised ease the boatman stood, And dipped his paddle in the flood: And so the open space was gained, and left behind the wood. The dripping blade, with measured stroke, In ripples soft the surface broke; As once Apollo, kissing oft, the nymph Cyrene woke. And, fast pursuing in his wake, I heard the dimpling eddies break In murmurs faint, as if they said—Herefrom example take. Unruffled as this river, lies The stream of life to youthful eyes; On either bank a wood and mart, and overhead God's skies. Behind thee slopes the pleasant shore, The tumult of the town before, And thou, who standest in the stern, hast in thy hand an oar. Oh son of toil, whose poet's heart Grieves from thy quiet woods to part, And yet whose birthright high it is, to labor in the mart, To thee, a child, the bloom was sweet; But manhood loves the crowded street, And where in closes, loud and clear, the forging hammers beat. But even there may bloom for thee The blossoms childhood loved to see; And in the cinders of thy toil, God's fairest flowers be. 1847. A MAY MORN. Last night the town was close and warm, But while we slept, arose a storm: And now how clear And cool and fresh the morning air. Between the swarthy trunks I walk, Which she made lovely with her talk, Saying;—‘Dear love, ‘I see these branches from above; ‘And when you are no longer here, I say—'t was there he called me “dear,” His pride—his pet;— So, absent, you are with me yet.’ How still it is!—the city lies Behind, half hidden from the eyes; And from the tops Of trees around the moisture drops. A bird with scarlet on his wings, Down in the meadow sits and sings; Beneath his weight The long corn-tassels undulate. The thrush and red-bird in the brake Flit up and from the blossoms shake, Across the grass, A fragrant shower where I pass. Ah, thank God for this peace and rest, But more for that within my breast— How with a song The very river ebbs along. A song indeed most musical To him who on death's threshold shall Revive to know The faint and melancholy flow. Yet still the same as when he stood With musing eyes bent on the flood, And smiled to hear The ripples say—‘I love thee, dear!’ Not that they said so in good sooth, But that he—(I, in simple truth!)— Seemed thence to hear The words that in my bosom were: As once she said them with the braid That bound her throbbing temples, laid Against my cheek, So I could even feel her speak. And when she, blushing, ceased,—and I Was mute with joy—the ripples nigh Took up the strain, And said,—‘I love thee, Sweet!’—again. And thenceforth all that once was fair, Grew fairer:—what unsightly were, Divine, if she But praised them incidentally. For she is dearer to me, than Was ever woman yet to man; Are one, be sure, Her life and mine for evermore. 1847. LOVE'S HERALDRY. Down where the river flows between The city and the dusky screen Of willow branches long and green That dim the village lights behind, With her who is so debonaire, In excellence of heart and mind So far—so far beyond compeer, What happiness I find. There yestereve, with hands in mine Fast locked as in the olden time, And words more musical than rhyme To ears that listened wistfully Yet scarce were satisfied—we stood The queenly Dian's disk to see Above the distant cypress wood Soar up triumphantly. And while we talked of what should be Our future lot, nor could agree Therein at first—‘Heart's-dearest, see (I said)—a cloudy fess in twain Divides Diana's silver shield.’ And while she gazed, I cried again; ‘Superior in the azure field, Behold it ONE again!’ So chid I gently. She is wise, And quick to understand; her eyes Turned to me with a glad surprise, And such deep love, that I—(I own,) When on my breast her head she laid, Found my philosophy all flown. For who hath courage to upbraid A queen upon her throne? 1847. LAST GIFT. Illustrious thy name shall be To all who love in future years: These little songs I sing to thee, Thy tears, Thy many griefs will I bequeath To uncreated heirs. Now, hidden are the quiet ways That bring thee to my bosom nigh; And when is spent thy term of days, Thou'lt die: Then shall thy virtues live in praise That riches cannot buy. Night shall descend upon thy eyes, Thy lips no more repeat my name; But all the virtuous and wise Shall claim Thee for their sister:—See, they'll say— Her whom he raised to fame! 1847.</field>
